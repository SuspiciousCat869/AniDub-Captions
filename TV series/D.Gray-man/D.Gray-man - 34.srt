1
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,250
You're the one to blame!

2
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,250
No... I...

3
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,375
I can't believe you saved me!

4
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:00,875
Do you really have to cry?

5
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:03,541
You'd cry too if the
landlord just saved your life!

6
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,291
When I woke up here,
I was tied up.

7
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,541
And the next thing
I knew, he was--

8
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,458
You mean you were
asleep the whole time?

9
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:10,791
That's right...

10
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:13,750
I was having this beautiful
dream about a steak!

11
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:30,000
Wait... is this
the Witch's Cabin?

12
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,583
Don't ask me.

13
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,458
I don't even know
how I got here!

14
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,625
You came here all by yourself?

15
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,625
I don't remember anybody else.

16
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,875
But I don't think I'd remember
even if somebody was there,

17
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,166
with the way I was dreaming.

18
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:49,458
I can see it now--the biggest,
juiciest steak there ever was!

19
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:50,833
I kept trying to eat it,

20
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,500
but whenever I got close
the plate ran away from me!

21
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:01,708
When I came to,

22
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,708
I was all alone and
tied up in this bed.

23
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:09,083
I guess... that's
not too helpful, is it?

24
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:10,833
Oops...

25
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,458
You're disgusting.

26
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,791
All this excitement
is making me hungry.

27
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:18,750
I'm glad I still have these
jellybeans from earlier.

28
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:19,916
Oh, no!

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,166
There's a hole in
the bottom of the bag!

30
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,875
I must have been dropping
beans the whole way here.

31
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,000
I thought you left
that trail on purpose!

32
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,916
And waste all
that delicious candy?

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,625
No sir, not me!

34
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:34,500
If it wasn't for Sofia,
I might have been in trouble!

35
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,625
So now what?

36
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,041
Now that you know the danger
involved, what will you do?

37
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,916
Me...? Probably
go back to my room

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,708
and eat the rest of the
jellybeans...

39
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:45,375
Wrong...

40
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,791
We're not done here.

41
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,125
Hold on...

42
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,958
Do you see the path
just beyond those trees?

43
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,333
It leads out of the village.

44
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,541
Since we're already so close,

45
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,500
maybe you should
think about leaving!

46
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,583
In fact, I should join
you so you don't get lost!

47
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,291
Why's that?

48
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,208
You have to help me!

49
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:10,083
I'm begging you...!
Please believe me...

50
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,791
There's a witch
living in this town!

51
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,625
We have to get out of here!

52
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:16,916
Please!

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,916
We're staying.

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,166
No...

55
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,041
Listen... Pull yourself
together...

56
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,375
Where is the witch?

57
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,750
By the looks of the cabin,

58
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,250
someone had been living
there until very recently...

59
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,541
Where are they now...?

60
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:35,083
Why won't you answer me?

61
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,875
Are you protecting the witch?

62
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:43,875
What was that?

63
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,666
What scared the
landlord so bad...?

64
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,833
Kanda...? Why did
he run off like that?

65
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:51,125
It seems there truly
is a witch in town.

66
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,666
What?

67
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,541
I'm glad you stuck around...

68
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,416
Akuma.

69
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,041
I'm sorry!

70
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,125
Please sir, try to hang
on as long as you can.

71
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm sorry...

72
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,166
Please forgive me!

73
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,541
It's time to go.

74
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:48,916
Okay.

75
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,125
Sofia.

76
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,958
I'm glad you came back.

77
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,416
Where have you two been?

78
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,583
When I woke up my father
and both of you were gone,

79
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:08,708
I was so worried.

80
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,666
Well, the... the
thing is, you're dad...

81
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,500
Sofia...

82
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,916
I have bad news.

83
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,083
Do you?

84
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,416
I'm afraid your father is dead.

85
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,000
He was killed by an Akuma while
trying to escape the village.

86
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,125
That is bad news.

87
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,125
Sofia...

88
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,500
You're the witch, aren't you?

89
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:29,416
Kanda...! The poor thing
just lost her father!

90
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,083
Will you please shut up...?
Answer my questions.

91
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:36,875
Are you the witch that plagues
this village or aren't you?

92
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,125
I'm not...

93
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,750
You're mistaken.

94
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,458
I see.

95
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:45,041
Then who has been living in
the Witch's Cabin until now?

96
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:54,125
For generations this town
has told the legend of a witch.

97
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:57,125
And for years, any old
woman unfortunate enough

98
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,166
to live alone in
Dankern Village was cast

99
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,541
in the role by the townspeople.

100
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:02,916
The role?

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,375
Yes.

102
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,708
In return for small daily
meals and a place to stay,

103
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:11,375
she took on the scorn and
hatred of the entire town.

104
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,625
She became their witch.

105
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,125
As long as there
was someone to blame

106
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,625
for all of the town's
troubles and misfortunes,

107
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,416
the people felt safe...

108
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,375
And as long as they felt safe,

109
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:24,125
the legend of the
witch survived.

110
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,750
No way...

111
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,458
But one month ago...

112
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:30,916
The old woman who was
the town's witch, died.

113
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,708
But... old people
die all the time, right?

114
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:34,583
It just happens.

115
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:35,833
Idiot.

116
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,916
The legend is
important to them...

117
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,166
If the village witch is dead,

118
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,041
she has to be
replaced with another.

119
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,375
Correct.

120
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,333
They just couldn't stand
to break the tradition...

121
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,958
They needed a witch
as soon as possible...

122
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:51,666
And it wasn't long before they
had selected her replacement.

123
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,291
It was Angela...

124
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,833
They choose my sister...

125
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,083
A little girl?

126
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,166
Yes...

127
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,625
She was actually my twin...

128
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,000
However...

129
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:06,625
Unlike me, Angela was
weak, and in poor health.

130
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,541
Hey, Angela.

131
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,958
I thought...

132
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,000
Maybe I could stay here.

133
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,041
What's so funny?

134
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,875
That certainly isn't the way
you were talking yesterday...

135
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,291
You went on and on about how
you wanted to see a city...

136
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,458
Does that sound familiar?

137
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,333
I'm glad I finished in time.

138
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:32,958
What's this?

139
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,125
I want you to take extra
good care of yourself

140
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,791
when you're in Mitterwald.

141
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,916
How long did it
take you to make it?

142
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,791
You know how much
you need your rest!

143
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,333
How else are you
going to get better?

144
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,416
I'm... I'm sorry.

145
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,708
It's just...

146
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,625
You never think
about yourself...

147
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,250
You always do so much for me

148
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:52,208
and I never get to do
anything for my twin sister.

149
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,000
I didn't mean to upset you.

150
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,000
Oh, Angela!

151
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,416
I promise you...

152
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,625
I'm going to find
a way to fix this.

153
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,708
I'll come up with the money
for your medicine somehow,

154
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,708
and we'll get a
doctor to look at you!

155
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,250
You'll be healthy
one day, I swear it.

156
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,666
And when you are,

157
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,458
we'll never have to worry
about anything else again.

158
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,500
I know...

159
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:16,708
Thank you.

160
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,708
But...

161
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,250
As soon as I started
working in Mitterwald;

162
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,875
Angela was chosen
as the next witch.

163
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,541
Father tried to stop them,
but no one would listen.

164
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,166
They took Angela
out of her sickbed

165
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,083
and moved her to the
cabin at the edge of town.

166
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,083
And that's where she stayed.

167
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:41,125
All alone, with no
one to look after her,

168
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,666
in that cold, dark cabin.

169
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:48,791
It wasn't long until
she fell into a coma.

170
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,458
She held on as
best as she could.

171
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,833
But in less than ten days...

172
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,333
I died.

173
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:58,041
It can't be...

174
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,083
That's so sad!

175
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,000
You said "I."

176
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:06,000
The day after I died...

177
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:11,083
Angela came back...
hoping to save me.

178
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,833
My body was still
lying on the bed

179
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,583
in the Witch's Cabin,
when she found me...

180
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,375
"My body"...? Whatta...

181
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,916
What are you talking about?

182
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,333
It's simple... You see--

183
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:25,166
That was when Sofia
met the Millennium Earl.

184
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,250
She wha--?!

185
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,000
That's right.

186
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:34,500
Angela!

187
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,375
This is my fault!

188
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,416
I'm sorry...

189
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,166
If I'd only been there--

190
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:40,833
Oh...

191
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,833
I hate to see a pretty girl cry.

192
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,041
But just because fate
deals you a bad hand,

193
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,208
it doesn't mean
you have to play it.

194
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,750
You can still have
your sister back.

195
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,625
Take revenge on God for
what he's done to you...

196
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,750
Show 'em you're in
control of your own destiny!

197
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,500
Now doesn't that
sound wonderful...

198
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,625
You could do that...?
Bring her back?

199
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:04,916
Of course!

200
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,083
You only have to wish for it.

201
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,958
Sofia... My god...

202
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,333
What have you done?

203
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,291
Angela...

204
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,166
Welcome home!

205
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,250
Yes...

206
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,791
Now you can be together at last!

207
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,375
All that remains is
for you to destroy her!

208
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,500
We never have to be
apart, ever again.

209
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,875
Angela!

210
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:31,916
Sofia.

211
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,291
I won't ever leave you.

212
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:39,291
Now... Let's begin.

213
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:42,583
Poor thing...

214
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,083
That's terrible...!

215
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,125
The two innocent little girls
had to lose their lives...

216
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,000
Just so the
townspeople could keep

217
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,208
their stupid fairy tale alive!

218
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,333
How nice of you to say that.

219
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:56,666
But there's really no
reason for you to cry.

220
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,375
Sweet boy...

221
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,666
Don't you understand...

222
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,791
I chose to bring myself back...

223
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,250
You see--

224
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:06,416
It was my decision
alone to cheat death...

225
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,333
I sacrificed my own
life in order to gain

226
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:11,000
one that couldn't
be lost so easily.

227
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,625
Then Sofia and Angela...

228
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,416
The twin souls that
longed to be together

229
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,916
combined to create
a powerful Akuma.

230
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,666
Does that mean the villagers--

231
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,708
It does!

232
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:30,875
No way...

233
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,833
Are they all Akuma, too?

234
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:35,166
I think you're right...

235
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,791
You turned everybody
in town into an Akuma?

236
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,916
That's... That's like
something a real witch would do!

237
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,541
That's exactly right.

238
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,375
I saw the legend
appealed to people,

239
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:50,750
so I made it real.

240
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,166
How could you?

241
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,625
How could I what?

242
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:54,750
Your father...

243
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,291
He loved you.

244
00:12:56,375 --> 00:13:00,708
My father's only responsibility
was to watch over this town.

245
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,458
But instead he
chose to run away.

246
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:04,958
This is his fault.

247
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,708
He tried.

248
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,958
How dare you pity him...?

249
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,708
He was a pathetic old man...

250
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:11,541
Because of him-- 

251
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,083
You're wrong!

252
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:16,166
I don't feel sorry for your
poor father and what you did...

253
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,375
The one I pity is you.

254
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,875
You're even dumber
than I thought...

255
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,083
Save your pity...

256
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,291
It's wasted on me!

257
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:29,541
If you're finished,
I'd like to continue...

258
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,041
Oh really... What a
wonderful idea...

259
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:35,541
Goodbye, Exorcist.

260
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,083
What are we gonna do?

261
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,583
Dankern belongs to its witch...

262
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,000
And every unfortunate soul

263
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,791
who crosses these borders
must suffer at her hands!

264
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,875
No one leaves
this village alive!

265
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:52,791
Get back...

266
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,458
You'll only get in the way...

267
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:55,750
Find a place to hide.

268
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,291
Unless you wanna die.

269
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,916
Right!

270
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,083
Idiot!

271
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,583
This is the end.

272
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,041
You're not suited
to be a Finder.

273
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,708
Kanda!

274
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:02,916
This is bad!

275
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,125
If the virus gets
into your body through

276
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,291
any of those wounds, you'll...

277
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,000
You don't have
to worry about me.

278
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,541
What if we can't stop
the virus from spreading?

279
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,708
My body isn't affected
by the Akuma virus.

280
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:16,958
Just forget it.

281
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,958
But, you're hurt!

282
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,833
I'll be fine.

283
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,083
Innocence... activate!

284
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,208
Bring forth calamity!

285
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,666
Netherworld Creature...

286
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,333
Ichigen!

287
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,750
There's one thing
I neglected to tell you.

288
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,208
What is it?

289
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,916
The last words your father
spoke before he passed away.

290
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,583
"I'm sorry...
Please forgive me."

291
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:02,541
So?

292
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,791
They were the same last words

293
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,500
as the villager I had
defeated before him...

294
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,750
"I'm sorry,
please forgive me"...

295
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,916
Who could they have
been apologizing to?

296
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,333
Who knows?
And who cares?

297
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:16,458
I have far better things
to concern myself with.

298
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,208
I suppose you have a point.

299
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,208
Oh, good...

300
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:22,125
I'm glad we see eye-to-eye.

301
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,041
You must have killed
thousands to reach this level.

302
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,125
And I've only just begun.

303
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,083
Not if I can help it!

304
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,708
Burn in hell.

305
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:03,833
No...

306
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,083
This is my room!

307
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,791
But how...? It's impossible...

308
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:15,291
How did she do it?

309
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:18,041
Impossible...

310
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,125
Yes...

311
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,500
It is impossible.

312
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,250
Prepare to die.

313
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,500
After you.

314
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,250
How?

315
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,041
You can read the memories
of your opponent...

316
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,750
You show him his
greatest desire in the form

317
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,958
of a dream in order to
distract and confuse him.

318
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,958
You weren't affected...

319
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,875
I showed you your true desire,
yet you're still calm.

320
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,375
The memory that you showed me...

321
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:57,833
That was only the surface
of my heart's one true desire.

322
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,625
You saw the lotus wither,

323
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,500
but you don't
understand its meaning.

324
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,958
Or what I long for.

325
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,083
My true desire can't
be granted by another,

326
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,875
no matter how powerful...

327
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,166
How dark...

328
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,541
And curious...

329
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:14,000
I never would have imagined
you were so complicated.

330
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,541
Sofia!

331
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:24,083
Oh no...

332
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,833
Stay back!

333
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,750
I'm evil...

334
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,166
I know you are...

335
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,000
But I still don't
want you to die.

336
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,291
Come back, Sofia!

337
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,166
Crying over a witch...

338
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,708
You're ridiculous...

339
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,833
Over... a witch.

340
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:55,166
I couldn't do
anything to help her.

341
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,541
It hurts so much!

342
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,083
Sofia...

343
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,083
Angela.

344
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:18,583
There is another Exorcist--a
clumsy bean-sprout of a boy--

345
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,541
who says he can see
the souls of Akuma.

346
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:22,791
I've heard.

347
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,708
According to him,
whenever Innocence is used

348
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,333
to release a soul from
the body of an Akuma,

349
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:31,500
that soul flies away to
heaven to live forever in peace.

350
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:34,541
Yeah...? Is that really true?

351
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,750
So... You're saying
not only are Angela

352
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,083
and Sofia's souls
finally together...

353
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,250
but they got to go
to heaven, as well?

354
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,583
Who knows...?

355
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,916
I was just telling you
what the kid told me...

356
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,833
Believe it if you want.

357
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,083
Akuma are Akuma.

358
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:48,750
Wait!

359
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:49,958
Where are you going?

360
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,916
There's nothing more
for me to do here.

361
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,125
Time to move on.

362
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,041
Well hold on a second!

363
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,250
Wait for me!

364
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,833
Quit following me.

365
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,208
I told you, you're not
suited to be a Finder.

366
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:00,416
Go back home.

367
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,583
But who do you have

368
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,333
to help you dress
all those fresh wounds?

369
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,541
They've healed.

370
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,375
Healed?

371
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,625
What do you mean, "healed"?

372
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,125
It's how my body works.

373
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,416
Don't worry about it.

374
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,458
I finally completed
my mission...

375
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:21,375
I wasn't able to retrieve
any Innocence, but...

376
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,916
all the Akuma in the
area were defeated...

377
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,416
All by yourself?

378
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,000
No...

379
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,000
It was Kanda...

380
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,625
I helped when I could,
but he did most of the work.

381
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:32,250
Wha...

382
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,250
Kanda...

383
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,375
Yeah...

384
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,291
That guy is one
incredible Exorcist...

385
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,375
My hero.

386
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,083
You certainly took
your time getting here.

387
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,333
What's wrong, Kanda?

388
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,458
You act like things
are finally looking up.

389
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,500
Which means?

390
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:53,791
Only that the
better your life is,

391
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,458
the more you seem to sulk.

392
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,416
I've known you long
enough to see it, my friend.

393
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,708
Whaddya say...?
Did I hit the mark?

394
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:41,208
Deep inside the forest,
a vicious pack of wolves

395
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:43,958
begins to attack the
townsfolk living there...

396
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:47,750
And the one who appeared before
them was none other than--

397
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,208
On the next episode
of D. Gray-man:

398
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:52,333
"Exorcist Clad in Wind."

399
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:56,166
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul!
