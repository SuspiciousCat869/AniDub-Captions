1
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,500
Hevlaska!

2
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:51,458
[LEVEL 4]
How lucky can I be?

3
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:54,500
There's even more humans
here than I thought.

4
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:57,708
[LAVI]
Damn it.

5
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:30,500
[LENALEE] Every night as I'm
falling asleep in my bed,

6
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,791
I wish for the same thing.

7
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,541
That the next morning
I'll wake up

8
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:37,833
only to discover that this
was all just a dream.

9
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,458
[LENALEE] In this world,
there was no holy war.

10
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,583
No Millennium Earl. Akuma.

11
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,375
Even the Exorcists
never existed.

12
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,000
They were only the
products of a nightmare.

13
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:58,875
[sighs]

14
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,958
[LENALEE] I sigh in relief
and think to myself,

15
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:04,125
"Good. It was all just a dream."

16
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,916
[LENALEE] From nearby,
I hear Komui calling my name.

17
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,875
And then I notice the telltale
signs he's cooking breakfast.

18
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,000
[LENALEE] It's like the
end of a bad novel.

19
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:26,166
No conflict. Shallow characters.
Barely any resolution.

20
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,958
The kind of story that
would disappoint readers.

21
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,125
[KOMUI]
Uhh...

22
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:36,208
[chuckles]

23
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:41,166
[LENALEE] But I don't care
how ridiculous it sounds.

24
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,166
I've imagined this scene
a thousand times.

25
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,083
[LENALEE]
I-Inno... cence.

26
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,041
[LENALEE]
Please.

27
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:05,750
God, I've hated you for so
long, but hear me, please.

28
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:10,166
I'm begging you...
Give me strength.

29
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,791
Look at me. I want
to see your eyes.

30
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,625
[LENALEE]
Never...

31
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,958
Never before in my life

32
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:25,500
have I wanted Innocence
as much as I do now.

33
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,166
[LENALEE grunts]

34
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,333
[ROUVELIER]
Huh?

35
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,125
[gasps]

36
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,708
Look at me.

37
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,375
So Walker made it out alive.

38
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,833
[LEVEL 4]
Very strange.

39
00:04:56,916 --> 00:05:00,875
How you can still move around
after what I did to you?

40
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:04,166
Last time we met, you
looked defeated to me.

41
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:28,958
Allen, no!

42
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,375
Allen!

43
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,625
These injuries...
How can you move?

44
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,416
You should be knocked out!

45
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:54,083
[KOMUI] His Crown Clown. It's
acting like a suit of armor.

46
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,541
[gasps]

47
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,250
[KOMUI] Somehow his Innocence
is controlling his body.

48
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,666
Forcibly moving it!

49
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,291
Allen, wait!

50
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:13,750
I'm tired of feeling helpless.
Needing saving.

51
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,333
Lenalee.

52
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:22,458
Has she started synchronizing
with her Innocence?

53
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,500
[LAVI]
Go to her, Komui.

54
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:32,041
She lives and fights
because of you.

55
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,291
You know that, don't you?

56
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,708
Go and stand beside her, Chief.

57
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,625
You're her big brother.

58
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,208
[KOMUI]
I want to.

59
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,166
But I don't know what to do!

60
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,041
What good would it bring?

61
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,125
[KANDA] What the hell
are you talkin' about?

62
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,750
How pathetic! You make me sick!

63
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:04,625
What's the matter?
Lose your sister complex?

64
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,875
[KOMUI]
Hey. Why did you kick me?

65
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:12,208
Can you even tell me the reason
why you joined the Black Order?

66
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,250
[KOMUI]
I'm home.

67
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,958
[KOMUI] I'll be living
here with you from now on.

68
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,500
[LENALEE]
Big brother.

69
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,208
I'm home.

70
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:40,083
Welcome back,
my sweet little sister.

71
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:43,125
[LENALEE]
I'm-I'm home.

72
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,166
Have a safe trip!

73
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,916
I'll see you later!

74
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,916
[chuckles]

75
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,500
[KOMUI]
Welcome home.

76
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:19,833
Lenalee.

77
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,541
[JOHNNY]
Here she is!

78
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,791
It's good to see
you home, Lenalee!

79
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,833
Good to be home.

80
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,375
Welcome back, sis.

81
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,875
There's no place like home, huh?

82
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,416
[LENALEE]
Those days are long gone.

83
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,541
I'm not that little girl
crying in bed anymore.

84
00:08:56,625 --> 00:09:00,750
I've got my brother and
everyone else at home.

85
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:06,041
That alone gives me the will to
fight in this nightmarish world.

86
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:09,958
Innocence... if you can turn
my emotions into strength

87
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:13,083
so I can protect
everyone I care about,

88
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:17,333
I vow... I'll follow you.

89
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:22,083
Right until the
very end. Anywhere.

90
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,250
[LENALEE]
But... still...

91
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,625
No matter what happens...

92
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:47,416
[LENALEE] In the end,
I'll come home to my brother.

93
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,166
I promise.

94
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,083
See you later, big brother!

95
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:07,041
[LENALEE]
Please tell me, "See you soon."

96
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:15,916
Until the day... when I smile
and say... "I'm home again."

97
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,458
[KOMUI]
She drank it!

98
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,458
[KOMUI]
Lenalee!

99
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,041
[LENALEE groaning]

100
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,333
[KOMUI]
Lenalee!

101
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,583
She's bleeding?

102
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,833
[ROUVELIER]
The body's rejecting it?

103
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,666
Allen Walker!

104
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,375
[ALLEN]
Take cover!

105
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,666
[laughing]

106
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:31,125
[LEVEL 4] I have more fun
for you! Puny Exorcist!

107
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,583
[yells]

108
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,875
Don't lose your footing!

109
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,708
You're the only one who
can fight right now!

110
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:04,125
[ALL yelling]

111
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,375
Lenalee.

112
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,833
[KOMUI]
Do something!

113
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:12,208
Hold on. I'll check.

114
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,291
Don't touch her feet.

115
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,500
[HEVLASKA] To think that
you swallowed it. Lenalee.

116
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,041
[KOMUI]
Don't blame her!

117
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:28,250
The Innocence turned
into liquid on its own.

118
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,000
It's as though it was
saying "drink me!"

119
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,666
[ROUVELIER]
Has the Innocence come to dwell

120
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,041
inside Lenalee's body?

121
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:39,000
Has it or hasn't it, Hevlaska?

122
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,625
Why hasn't the bleeding stopped?

123
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,166
Lenalee!

124
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,041
[yells]

125
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,500
Allen!

126
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:10,458
What fun. He still
hasn't had enough yet.

127
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,916
[yells]

128
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,750
Yu!

129
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,625
[yells]

130
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,791
Now, short stack!

131
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,750
[yells]

132
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,416
It stopped the blade?

133
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,458
[LEVEL 4]
That won't do at all.

134
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:33,750
If you want to play rough,

135
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,291
why didn't you say so
in the first place?!

136
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,541
Let's play rough!

137
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:40,250
[LAVI screams]

138
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,083
[LEVEL 4]
You're not tired, are you?

139
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:50,333
I'm not finished playing
with you just yet.

140
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,375
Allen, no!

141
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,375
Hevlaska! How does it look?

142
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:00,791
[HEVLASKA]
What can this mean?

143
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,625
What's the matter?

144
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,125
[HEVLASKA]
It's gone.

145
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:07,291
She may have swallowed
her Innocence,

146
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:10,875
and I detect signs that it
passed through her body,

147
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,250
but I am completely unable
to sense it within her.

148
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,750
[ROUVELIER]
What? That can't be true!

149
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:20,625
[HEVLASKA]
It's gone. It's not in her body.

150
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,166
[HEVLASKA]
Where then?

151
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,083
[KOMUI]
Her blood, it's--

152
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,416
[gasps]

153
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,041
That's impossible.

154
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,416
My Innocence.

155
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,625
You sensed it, didn't you?

156
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,708
That I'm prepared.

157
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,583
Amazing. I've never seen
anything like this.

158
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:23,166
The innocence is weaponizing
itself with Lenalee's blood.

159
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,833
Activate.

160
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:46,166
You managed to
entertain me. Even so...

161
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,125
Time to say goodbye!

162
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,916
How dare you enter our home
and try to destroy it!

163
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,625
Wanna play too?

164
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,250
[LENALEE]
It's gonna fire.

165
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,541
Allen! Lenalee!

166
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,000
That was a direct hit!

167
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:25,500
You're wrong. I didn't hit them.

168
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,250
There you are!

169
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,041
[LAVI]
They flew up that high?

170
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,208
Kanda, did you see them?

171
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,458
Too fast for my eyes.

172
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,125
[ALLEN]
Way too fast.

173
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,333
[LENALEE]
Huh? I'm sorry!

174
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,833
I hope it didn't make you sick!

175
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,166
[LENALEE]
That's strange.

176
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,458
I wasn't trying
to jump this high.

177
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:54,458
I must be getting used to the
Dark Boots again and misjudged.

178
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,416
Is that a butterfly?

179
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,583
[LENALEE yells]

180
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,166
I'll be all right.

181
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,416
You shouldn't be afraid
to let go of me, Lenalee.

182
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,833
I'll extend the Clown Belt
to prevent me from falling.

183
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:26,125
There's one more thing.

184
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:31,875
Back in Lab Five,
I couldn't protect everyone.

185
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,541
I'm sorry.

186
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,291
[LENALEE] I'm sorry, too.
For getting here so late.

187
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,541
You ready to stop it?

188
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,083
[ALLEN]
Here we go!

189
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,708
I'm waiting!

190
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:03,333
[ROUVELIER] Excellent.
She can take on the Level 4.

191
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,041
It appears her activation
was successful.

192
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:09,458
If she and Walker work
together, we should be fine.

193
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,041
[KOMUI]
I'm not sure.

194
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,166
Allen's exhausted, stretched
way beyond his limits.

195
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,875
And Lenalee's boots,

196
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,500
this is first time
she's activated them.

197
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,416
[static]

198
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,958
[BOTH yell]

199
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:01,333
[LEVEL 4 groaning]

200
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,125
You're too weak by yourself.

201
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,083
But I'm not alone.

202
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,541
[LEVEL 4]
The girl!

203
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,750
[LENALEE]
Gotta get higher.

204
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:25,000
The higher the drop,
the greater speed!

205
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,416
I'll accelerate for more power.

206
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,333
[LENALEE]
These Dark Boots,

207
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,500
they're way different
from the previous ones.

208
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,333
There's no need to control them.

209
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:45,916
They respond to my
thoughts all on their own.

210
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,791
They don't feel like an
Equipment Type at all.

211
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,708
[LENALEE]
Launching!

212
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,500
[LEVEL 4]
Let me go!

213
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,375
There's no way! You're finished!

214
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:09,000
I said let me go,
you pathetic human scum!

215
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,833
Is it over with?

216
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,958
[ALLEN] Just as it appears
we've won against the Level 4,

217
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,291
the Akuma refuses
to be defeated,

218
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:20,916
lashing out at us
with tremendous rage.

219
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,791
Now, the final battle begins.

220
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,625
On the final episode
of D.Gray-man:

221
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,708
"Echoes in the Long Morning."

222
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:32,041
Bring forth salvation to
this poor Akuma's soul!

223
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,458
[LAVI]
What a day!

224
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,083
--[LENALEE] You said it!
--[ALLEN] Wanna grab some chow?

225
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:37,791
--That sounds great!
--Yeah!

226
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:39,125
[chuckles]

227
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:45,708
It's mine! All mine! I have just
taken control of the classroom!

228
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:48,208
[ALLEN]
Um, hey, Level 4?

229
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:49,625
School's been let
out for the day,

230
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:50,791
so you should probably leave

231
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:53,416
and go home before
the teachers find you.

232
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,750
I can't win.

233
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:55,916
[LENALEE, LAVI]
Hm?
