1
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:42,750
The Heart of Innocence?

2
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,250
Yes, though we still don't fully

3
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:46,791
understand exactly what it is.

4
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,500
For instance, are
there any characteristics

5
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:51,125
that can help us distinguish
it from other Innocence?

6
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:52,416
The cube doesn't say.

7
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,041
One possibility that we need

8
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,875
to consider is that someone
may have already retrieved it

9
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:59,083
and become its Accommodator.

10
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,000
In regards to the
Millennium Earl...

11
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,000
and judging by
the recent events,

12
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,458
it appears that he
suspected the Heart

13
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,041
to reside among
the upper echelon

14
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,708
of Accommodators
within the Order.

15
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:10,375
Which lead to
our first victim...

16
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:11,791
General Yeegar...

17
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,291
The resurgence of
the Clan of Noah,

18
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,958
and the fact that they
are appearing with

19
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,583
Akuma suggests that they are
strengthening their forces.

20
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,666
Sounds like a good assessment...

21
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,083
If you couple that
with the timing

22
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,583
of the Earl's most recent
message to the Exorcists,

23
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,416
I'd say we are right on track.

24
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,416
It makes sense,

25
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,583
if I had to choose
an Accommodator

26
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,166
that can handle the
Heart of Innocence,

27
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,625
a General would be the
most likely candidate.

28
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:32,833
However...

29
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,250
A coordinated attack
by the Clan of Noah

30
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:37,833
and Akuma would put any
General at a grave disadvantage.

31
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,958
At this point we have only
four General's remaining...

32
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:47,250
Klaud Nine... Socalo...
Cross... and finally, Tiedoll.

33
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,666
I'm assigning teams of Exorcists

34
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,666
to protect our Generals so
that we may defend against

35
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,375
the attacks that
are sure to come.

36
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,708
Allen, Lenalee,
listen closely...

37
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,291
You are to leave now...

38
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:59,416
You must General Cross
and protect him.

39
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,125
Are you okay?

40
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,250
It's just you haven't
seemed yourself lately...

41
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:17,416
Does it have anything to do with
General Yeegar passing away?

42
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,375
I guess...

43
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,000
He was
such a nice man...

44
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,875
He treated me like
I was his student,

45
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,375
like I was one of his own.

46
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,291
Before meeting him...

47
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:30,125
I never thought a General
was capable of generosity.

48
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,416
Because...

49
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,250
The image in my head of a
General was always

50
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,916
a self-centered, egotistical
sociopath who would

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,208
deal out pain and suffering
without a moments notice.

52
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,666
It seems like General Cross
put you through the ringer...

53
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,958
Does that sound about right?

54
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,500
Just thinking back to my days
in training makes me dizzy!

55
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,166
Oh no, I'm feeling faint!

56
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,541
Maybe you should sit
down for a sec...

57
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:56,583
Of all people, why me?

58
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,541
Cause you're his apprentice.

59
00:03:58,625 --> 00:03:59,500
Huh?

60
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,208
Remember what my brother said?

61
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,708
As you are aware,
we have not been in contact

62
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,041
with General Cross in
nearly four years now...

63
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,458
Either he's dead,

64
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,875
or he's up to no good,
both of which are bad for us.

65
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,000
There have been numerous rumors.

66
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,500
If you want to know my
opinion I think he's alive...

67
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,291
But now I know how
to track him down...!

68
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,708
Thanks to you.

69
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,625
He's a rat in a trap
and you're the bait!

70
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,166
Now you're under
orders to find him.

71
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,208
So, the only thing
I don't understand

72
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:30,875
is why we're going to
Liverpool of all places.

73
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,125
It's cause of a woman...

74
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,875
She and Cross
were very close once,

75
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,791
so I thought it'd be
a good place to start.

76
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,125
A woman...? His girlfriend?

77
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,208
No... it's his sponsor.

78
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:46,000
Have you... ever met
General Cross before?

79
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,208
Yeah I met him briefly
at Headquarters once,

80
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,666
but that was a long time ago.

81
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,166
If that's the case,

82
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,375
I think it'd be best if I told
you about him beforehand.

83
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:58,166
There's some things you need to
know about what makes him tick.

84
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,291
I hope you enjoy your tea.

85
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,000
You told me once
your first encounter

86
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,125
with General Cross
was three years ago.

87
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,916
That's right,
it was three years...

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,250
It was right after I had
destroyed my father,

89
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:21,458
and then foolishly turned
him into an Akuma.

90
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,375
I'm so sorry...

91
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,625
I never meant to
bring up bad memories.

92
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:26,458
It's fine...

93
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:27,500
That wasn't the worse part.

94
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,208
The hard times came later.

95
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,166
What was so difficult
about his training?

96
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,916
Was he physically
abusive or something?

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,958
No not that...

98
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,500
The training was
the easiest part...

99
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,666
But Master Cross' inability
to manage his money

100
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,166
is what did me in.

101
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,083
There you are, Cross!

102
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,041
How you doin...?

103
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,375
So you think you could
take my woman's money

104
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,166
and get away with it unharmed.

105
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,333
Get up, let's have a chat.

106
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,166
Master Cross, hold up!

107
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,500
Get back here you freak!

108
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,166
Give me my money
or you're a dead man!

109
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,375
Get 'em!

110
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,916
Take good care of
them for me, will ya?

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,750
Huh?

112
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,458
Here.

113
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,958
Uhh... What am I supposed
to do with that?

114
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:35,875
Can't you read, kid?

115
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:36,791
It's insurance...

116
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,458
Now sign on the line now.

117
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,291
If your Master can't
pay off his debts

118
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,791
then his apprentice will
have to pay with his life...

119
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,791
If you want to give us
any trouble you'll end up

120
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,458
at the bottom of the
Seine, so just try me.

121
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,041
Help...! Someone help me!!!

122
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,500
Hey, get back here you brat!

123
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:56,291
I managed to escape,
but it wasn't the last time...

124
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,208
Master Cross accumulated debts

125
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:02,166
across all of Europe,
one after another.

126
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,000
Hey little guy...!
Take a break...!

127
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,125
I don't want you
wearing yourself out now.

128
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,208
Thank you...! But I think
I'll save it for later

129
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,708
after I get some more work done.

130
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,416
Well don't kill yourself.

131
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,333
After working off
Master Cross's debts,

132
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,541
I'd only take home a
fraction of what I earned.

133
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:24,750
You worked all day long

134
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,750
and this is all you
have to show for it...?

135
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,000
You're more pathetic
than I thought.

136
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,208
Wait... Master Cross...

137
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:35,041
Try making some more money kid.

138
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,750
I will one day...

139
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:42,958
Ugh... I can't even tell you

140
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,458
how many times I wanted
to lash out at him.

141
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,666
But of course when all
was said and done...

142
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,125
I continued to work
myself to the bone

143
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:53,000
in order to pay off the
rest of what he owed.

144
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,708
At one point I was working

145
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,166
on a fishing boat in
the Mediterranean Sea.

146
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,958
Another time I was hauling cargo
across the Egyptian desert,

147
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,666
and nearly got myself
killed in the process.

148
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,666
And then we ended up in Kenya.

149
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,500
Allen, yeah... I want
to see one of those lions...

150
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,666
Go get one for me.

151
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:33,041
I still can't believe
I survived that day.

152
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,500
I remember thinking that

153
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,375
if I continued to
do these jobs...

154
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:42,250
I wasn't going to see
my next birthday.

155
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,375
So in order to make enough
money to live on my own...

156
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,083
I learned how to gamble.

157
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,125
Royal straight flush.

158
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,250
I originally started
playing cards

159
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,500
so I could rehabilitate
my paralyzed left hand.

160
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,958
But when you're
putting your life

161
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,291
on the line in dirty saloons,
your skills can advance quickly.

162
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,375
Soon enough I had mastered

163
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,916
a slew of cheats
and couldn't lose.

164
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:14,208
Now I can't touch a deck of
cards without winning money.

165
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,625
Do you not believe me?

166
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,583
No... I believe you Allen!

167
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,875
Okay... That was a bit creepy...

168
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,791
But my new talent
put me in a dilemma...

169
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,458
Once Master realized
how much money

170
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,625
I could bring
in gambling...

171
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:33,083
...his spending and
partying skyrocketed.

172
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,708
I started to believe
I would be a slave

173
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,916
to my Master for
the rest of my life,

174
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,375
and it turned me into
a really mean person...

175
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,833
But Allen, that's how
anyone would react...

176
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,458
Besides, things would
have been a lot better

177
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:47,000
if you had a friend
that you could talk to.

178
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,083
Something wrong...?

179
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:52,000
Did I just bring up another
bad memory from your past?

180
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,458
I did have a friend...

181
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,166
That's crazy, huh...?

182
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,791
I'd finally found someone...

183
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,416
He was somebody
I could confide in

184
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,583
and depend on and honestly
call my best friend.

185
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,000
Narain was his name.

186
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,000
He was my age...

187
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,208
...and he changed
my life forever...

188
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,125
Hey Allen...
What happened to you?

189
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,666
I had to clean a bunch
of chimneys today

190
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,083
and I ended up
falling off of the roof...

191
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,875
I twisted my ankle.

192
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,541
Way to go...

193
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,291
Show it to me.

194
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:32,791
Ah, take it easy.

195
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,041
That hurt!

196
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,416
Well the good news is
your bone isn't broken.

197
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,166
Don't be so rough Narain,
my ankle really hurts...

198
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,250
A little pain will
do you some good.

199
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,166
I met him while
I was working in India...

200
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,416
Right after we moved
there from Africa...

201
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,125
Master ended up living
in a palace that belonged

202
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,875
to the Maharaja,
who ruled the land.

203
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:57,666
Inside the palace lived a widow
that went by the name Urmina...

204
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,041
She and Master Cross
were... well, you know...

205
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:07,083
Lovers?!

206
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,041
Geez... Keep it down.

207
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,333
I'm sorry,

208
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:17,666
but did he really do that
with a Maharaja's widow?

209
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,916
Yeah...

210
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Honestly I don't know
how it's even possible,

211
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,166
but Master's very
good with the ladies.

212
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,125
While Master was
getting to know Urmina,

213
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,583
I got to know Narain...

214
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,958
I immediately noticed
how smart he was.

215
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,666
He wanted to become a
doctor when he grew up.

216
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,208
Any time he wasn't working,

217
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,708
he would immerse himself
in advanced medical books,

218
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,500
studying so he could
one day attain his dream.

219
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,541
He had an older
sister named Miena...

220
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,500
She worked as Urmina's servant.

221
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,833
Miena's dream was to
someday become a dancer,

222
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,708
so every chance she got she
would twirl through the palace,

223
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:59,125
dreaming of being
on stage in London.

224
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,750
Whenever I saw those two...

225
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:06,333
they would really help me see my
own situation in a better light.

226
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,125
So they encouraged you.

227
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,375
Yes, definitely.

228
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,875
Even though they were young,
they were so positive...

229
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,083
They both believed
deep down in their hearts

230
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,708
that better times were waiting
for them in the future.

231
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,833
Unfortunately... the
future they dreamed of,

232
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,250
never became a reality.

233
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,833
I had been working in
India for six months,

234
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,708
when it happened.

235
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,166
At the local saloon,
I used money

236
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,041
that I had earned
from several of my jobs

237
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:46,041
to win a huge pot in one
of the poker games...

238
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,333
Ahh...

239
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:49,791
As usual,

240
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,708
Master took every penny
I had won that night.

241
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,291
Master how much
longer are you going

242
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,666
to make me keep doing this...?

243
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,916
Let's not forget that it was you

244
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,875
who asked me to
become an Exorcist.

245
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,791
Yet here we are
over a year later

246
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,250
and I still haven't
trained for one minute.

247
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,458
I see.

248
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,875
You think you're ready
for training huh?

249
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,291
In all my travels around
the world with Master...

250
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:16,250
I had encountered Akuma
on numerous occasions...

251
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,666
But I had never
actually fought one.

252
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,958
Here's your chance, kiddo.

253
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,291
Huh?

254
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,458
How bout you show
me what you've got...

255
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,000
Now?

256
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,833
What...? This is impossible...

257
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,375
Help me!

258
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,416
He's... crazy...

259
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,166
Master Cross, please help me...!

260
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,458
There's no way I can
take on that many!

261
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,541
You're not gonna get very
far fighting empty-handed.

262
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,375
Lucky for you, there's
an Anti-Akuma weapon

263
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,916
inside that body of yours.

264
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,166
Maybe you should
try using it, yes?

265
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,791
An Anti-Akuma weapon?

266
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,416
Of course!

267
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,208
Nothing happened...!
What's wrong with it?

268
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,583
That's creepy...

269
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,333
I guess this is it!

270
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,333
I'm gonna die in my
first training session!

271
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,833
You're pathetic...!

272
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,750
For punishment you
must earn twice as much

273
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,125
from here on out...

274
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,833
Starting tomorrow...

275
00:14:58,708 --> 00:14:59,833
After that incident...

276
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,666
I was down in the
dumps once again.

277
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:09,541
So I decided to visit Narain in
the hopes that he'd cheer me up,

278
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,916
he was always good at that.

279
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,041
It's my sister...

280
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:28,416
She went into town...
to buy a book for me.

281
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,791
A monster appeared... and
everyone started to panic...

282
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:36,500
then the building
collapsed... on top of her.

283
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,750
I've looked through all my books

284
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:42,416
and I can't find anything
about how I can revive her...

285
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,166
I've read so many
pages about medicine,

286
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,250
and there's nothing
I can do for her...!

287
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:50,458
My sister's never coming back!

288
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,250
Hey Narain...

289
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,833
I brought this... for Meina.

290
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,750
Why thank you Allen...

291
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,750
Thanks a lot.

292
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:20,416
No... You can't be...

293
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,083
It's true... He is an Akuma.

294
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,375
I became concerned when
you told me he was grieving

295
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,333
over the unfortunate
loss of his sister.

296
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,166
Just as I thought,

297
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,416
the Millennium Earl paid
him a visit after all.

298
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,833
Wait, the Millennium Earl?

299
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:53,041
The Earl prey's on people
who are weak with sorrow

300
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,208
and turns them into Akuma.

301
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,291
Meina!!!

302
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:10,833
New mourning gives
birth to new Akuma...

303
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,875
In order to break that chain

304
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,291
it is our duty as Exorcists

305
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:21,166
to destroy every Akuma
that roams the Earth.

306
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,333
Now do it, Allen!

307
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,875
Destroy the Akuma
that stands before you!

308
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,791
What...? Impossible!

309
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,375
I can't do that!

310
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:33,458
It's Narain, I...
He's my friend!

311
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,333
I can't kill him...!I won't!

312
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,250
Your friend is already dead...

313
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,375
He's an Akuma that's
wearing Narain's skin.

314
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,916
Nothing more, nothing less.

315
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:48,083
Allen, you have to destroy it!

316
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:56,791
Stop...! Don't run.

317
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:01,125
It's your duty to break the
chain of sorrow Allen, do it.

318
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,083
Sorrow?

319
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,666
The soul is crying...

320
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,666
It's... Miena.

321
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,041
Even though I passed away,

322
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,333
you should have continued
to live your life,

323
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:24,166
so you could work towards your
dream of becoming a doctor...

324
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,583
Why didn't you go after
your dream... Narain?

325
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,041
All Akuma are grieving...

326
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,666
They feel horrible for
allowing themselves

327
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,916
to be turned into weapons
and are crying for help.

328
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,250
The only way I can alleviate
their pain and purify it,

329
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,958
is by destroying the Akuma
and releasing their soul.

330
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,708
I have no other choice.

331
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:48,416
Bring forth salvation... to
this tormented Akuma's soul!

332
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:57,375
Rest in peace... Miena.

333
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:04,458
Thank you so much... Allen.

334
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:11,708
Miena... And Narain.

335
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,041
How was it...?

336
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,208
Tell me exactly how it felt

337
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:22,916
to destroy an Akuma
for the first time.

338
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,208
It was hard... so hard.

339
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,041
Because... my friends...

340
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,083
...still aren't
coming back to me!

341
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:33,041
That's something you're
gonna have to get used to,

342
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,291
because if you can't,

343
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:38,041
then the life of an
Exorcist is not for you.

344
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,291
Good work today...

345
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,625
Considering it was
your first time,

346
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,083
you did exceptionally well.

347
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,833
That was two years ago.

348
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,583
And so Master continued to
throw me into the heat

349
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:54,666
of battle every time an Akuma
would appear before us...

350
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,500
I welcomed the experience.

351
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:57,958
I guess you weren't kidding...

352
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,375
That's a crazy story...

353
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,250
Much crazier than
I thought it'd be...

354
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,916
For all of General
Cross' flaws though...

355
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,583
He sounds interesting...

356
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,541
Now you know what
I was talking about...

357
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:08,750
My Master's crazier than a...

358
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,208
He sounds amazing!

359
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,250
Say what?!

360
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,458
I didn't understand
everything...

361
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:13,791
Especially the part
about the Akuma

362
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,291
or whatever you
call those things,

363
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,875
but there's one thing
I know for sure...!

364
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,333
This Master of yours
is a commendable man!

365
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:20,708
Most people can only dream of

366
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,166
having such a
positive influence!

367
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,916
Your story really
touches my heart...!

368
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,916
What a charming man
this Master Cross is!

369
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,166
Oh, I'd love to meet him!

370
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,458
What...? My story...
touched you...?

371
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,000
Wait, which part?!

372
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,333
The whole thing!

373
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:34,750
Hold on!

374
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:38,458
My Master's a maniac...!
How can you find that endearing?

375
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,750
Now now...

376
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,750
Did you ever think that
General Cross is strict

377
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,500
with you because
he cares about you?

378
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,791
What...? You too Lenalee...?!
I don't get it...

379
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:50,375
Why are women so easily swayed
by guys like Master?

380
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,166
I guess it's true
that women really do

381
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,833
like men who have a bad side?

382
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,875
The thing with Master is
he's not just bad, he's evil!

383
00:20:56,958 --> 00:21:00,541
So why do women constantly
fawn all over him...?!!!

384
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,125
Oh, forget it! I'll never
understand women!

385
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm clueless! There, I said it!

386
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,958
Arystar Krory is
now an Exorcist...

387
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,375
His orders take him to a village

388
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:45,000
where he encounters
a formidable Akuma,

389
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,791
the likes of which he
has never seen before.

390
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:52,041
On the next episode of
D. Gray-man: "Exorcist Krory."

391
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:55,875
Bring forth salvation to this
tormented Akuma's soul.
