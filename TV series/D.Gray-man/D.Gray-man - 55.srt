1
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:45,666
[SUMAN DARK roars]

2
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,750
[ALLEN] There's something about

3
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:49,416
the destructive force
Suman possesses.

4
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500
The quantity is unusual.

5
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:54,541
Is it possible... Is the
Innocence boosting its power

6
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:58,125
by devouring his body and
shooting out that energy?

7
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,833
[ALLEN]
He can't go on like this.

8
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,833
His Innocence is killing him.

9
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:13,250
I have no choice. I have to
separate him from it.

10
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,958
There's no other way.

11
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,541
He'll lose his arm,
but at least he won't die.

12
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,583
It's the only choice.

13
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,416
I believe he would want this.

14
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,291
Above all else, he wants to
live! So it has to be done.

15
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,833
Here we go. Innocence Activate!

16
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:36,333
[ALLEN yells]

17
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,625
[ALLEN gasping]

18
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:55,541
[ALLEN groaning]

19
00:02:55,625 --> 00:03:00,083
It hurts. Why does it hurt?
What's wrong?

20
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:07,666
[screams]

21
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,875
No. It's back up
and moving again!

22
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,791
[VILLAGERS gasping]

23
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,375
[ALLEN screaming]

24
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:40,750
[ALLEN]
I heard a snapping sound,

25
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:45,291
but I don't... I don't feel it.

26
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,375
[ALLEN gasps]

27
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,875
[ALLEN groaning]

28
00:03:57,125 --> 00:04:01,291
[ALLEN grunting]

29
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:19,708
[ALLEN]
Don't do it... Suman...

30
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,916
[VILLAGERS gasping]

31
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,541
[VILLAGERS whimper]

32
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:25,958
It's coming this way!

33
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,250
[whimpers]

34
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:38,541
[VILLAGERS screaming]

35
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:46,291
[VILLAGERS screaming]

36
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:59,041
[SUMAN]
Please. I don't wanna die.

37
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:03,541
I just wanted to see my
daughter again. That's all.

38
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:10,916
[SUMAN] Someone please,
someone stop this.

39
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,125
[TYKI]
Well, well.

40
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:15,458
Quite the show he's
putting on. Although...

41
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,166
Doesn't look like he's
got too much left

42
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,916
in the mortality department.

43
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:26,666
[TYKI] So then. Just what will
he show us before he dies?

44
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,000
[LAVI yells]

45
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:42,833
I'm exhausted.

46
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:46,000
Jeez. I mean,
how many are there?

47
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,541
[BOOKMAN]
Mm? Is that...?

48
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:48,833
Huh?

49
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:54,541
What's happening over there?

50
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:03,916
You monster! Go back to hell!

51
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:24,166
[BOY B cries]
Wake up, Dad! Please, Dad!

52
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:31,458
[BOY B]
Dad. Please don't die! Dad!

53
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,166
You can't die!

54
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,708
I love you, Dad! No, please, no!

55
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,750
[JAMIE cries]
Don't go! Please, Dad!

56
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,333
[SUMAN DARK cries]

57
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:02,875
[BOY B]
I love you, Dad! Don't leave me!

58
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,833
Jamie!

59
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,833
[TYKI]
It looks like it's begun.

60
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,333
[SUMAN DARK screams]

61
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,083
What... What the hell
is happening?

62
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:59,125
[ALLEN grunts]
Su... man...

63
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:04,208
This... is this...?

64
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:12,041
[ALLEN]
Its body is disintegrating.

65
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,041
[gasps]

66
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,625
[ALLEN]
Has the last phase begun?

67
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,583
Does this mean that
Suman is dying?

68
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,416
I'm not letting
him die! [groans]

69
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:45,916
[groans] I can't move it.

70
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,333
It hurts too much. I've never
felt pain like this.

71
00:08:52,416 --> 00:09:00,708
I'm drowning in sorrow.
I can't... fight anymore.

72
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:06,166
I can't... I can't do anything.

73
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:17,250
Uh? Timcanpy?

74
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:24,625
Ahh! What're you-- What?

75
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,041
Hang on, are you,

76
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:30,458
are you telling me that
you're angry with me?

77
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,916
Ahh! Sorry! I get it! I'm sorry!

78
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,166
I'll try harder!

79
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,041
[gasps]

80
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,541
Yeah, it hurts.

81
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:48,375
I'm in pain, but it's not like
I'm dead or anything, right?

82
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:53,458
So yes, I've still got it
in me to do something.

83
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:56,833
Yeah. I'll try harder.

84
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:03,000
[ALLEN]
Okay, let's go!

85
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,875
[screams]

86
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:23,666
Don't worry, Tim.
I'm gonna do my best.

87
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,958
I've gotta hurry.

88
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,416
[ALLEN grunting]

89
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,458
Hey, Suman.

90
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:03,208
[SUMAN DARK gasps]
You're... an... Ex... orcist.

91
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:06,500
That's right, my name
is Allen Walker.

92
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:15,833
It seems that... my life
is coming to an end.

93
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:22,333
I'll soon be dead. When I die,
I'll take this monster with me.

94
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,041
It'll die, too.

95
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:30,958
I'm sorry. I only wanted
to see my family.

96
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,791
I'm so deeply sorry.

97
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,916
Suman...

98
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,083
There's not much time left.

99
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,916
Innocence... Activate!

100
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,708
[screaming]

101
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,583
[SUMAN DARK groans]

102
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:12,125
[ALLEN]
I clearly heard my bones snap.

103
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:16,708
But at that moment,
I didn't even care.

104
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,333
[ALLEN groaning]

105
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,083
[gasping] Allen...

106
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,541
[ALLEN]
Suman. Listen close.

107
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:26,291
I'm gonna separate the Innocence
from your right arm.

108
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,791
[SUMAN DARK]
What?

109
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,750
[ALLEN]
Once I've fully severed it,

110
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,541
I'm going to pull
you out of there.

111
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,250
[ALLEN]
But, my arm is broken

112
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,750
and I don't have the
strength for it.

113
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,791
So you need to bite down and
latch on with your teeth.

114
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,291
Don't let go no matter what!

115
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:48,083
Thank you, Allen Walker.

116
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:10,041
[screaming]

117
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,291
No, please stop it.

118
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:16,083
You're only going to get
yourself killed as well.

119
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:20,333
[screaming continues]

120
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:23,625
It's okay. Please,
just let me go.

121
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,458
I don't deserve to live.

122
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:32,958
I've murdered my comrades
and so many others.

123
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:36,041
I've committed an
unforgivable sin.

124
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:41,083
A sin so grave, I can never
atone. I'm not worthy of life.

125
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,666
There's no salvation for me.

126
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:50,375
[ALLEN gasping]
Just live. You have to live.

127
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:57,541
[ALLEN] For all of those people
who died. You need to live.

128
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,208
Allen...

129
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,375
Don't let the darkness win.

130
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,208
Don't let those
lives be in vain.

131
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:07,416
Please, Suman. You have to live!

132
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,458
[ALLEN groaning]

133
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:40,083
[SUMAN DARK]
I want to live! I want to live!

134
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,291
[ALLEN screaming]

135
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:47,291

[BOTH scream]

139
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,791
Hey, Timcanpy.

140
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,500
[gasps] Where's Suman?

141
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,083
Ah! He's alive.

142
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,375
[ALLEN groaning]

143
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,416
Uh! We did it.

144
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,250
We severed your
Innocence, Suman!

145
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:09,833
We actually saved you,
Suman! Now you can--

146
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:15,208
Huh? Suman?

147
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,375
[ALLEN]
What's wrong with you?

148
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,375
Please, talk to me.

149
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,291
[gasps] Suman?

150
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:33,083
[ALLEN]
He's lifeless.

151
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:37,500
No thoughts. No reaction.

152
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:43,125
His soul... It's gone.

153
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:50,875
Oh... He may be alive,
but his soul is dead.

154
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:54,666
Why? He shouldn't be like this.

155
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,750
[gasps]

156
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:08,916
[gasps]

157
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,208
Hold on, this is
Suman's Innocence.

158
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:19,875
[ALLEN]
Why? Why did this happen?

159
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,125
[ALLEN cries]

160
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,333
Tell me why!

161
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,333
[ALLEN]
Not yet. It's not over yet.

162
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,750
He's not actually dead.

163
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,041
He is still alive.

164
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,250
[ALLEN]
That's all that matters.

165
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:08,041
As long as he's alive, there may
still be some hope left for him.

166
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,833
I wanna believe that's true.

167
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,541
[ALLEN]
Now, Suman.

168
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:19,833
Let's go. Let's take
you home, to your family.

169
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,041

170
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:43,000
[JAMIE] I had a dream
last night, Doctor.

171
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,875
I can't remember
his face very clearly,

172
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:50,000
but I'm sure it was
a dream about my dad.

173
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:54,875
It was so simple.
He just waved and smiled at me.

174
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:59,958
As if he was telling me goodbye.

175
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:04,083
My dad, he's still out
there somewhere, isn't he?

176
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:07,208
He will come back
someday, right?

177
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,875
[chair legs scrape]

178
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,291
[JAMIE]
Uh?

179
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:14,041
[DOCTOR] Of course he will,
Jamie. There's no doubt.

180
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,916
Goodnight now, Suman.

181
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,666
[ALLEN]
Too feeble to fight back,

182
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,041
the Noah thrusts his arm
entirely through my torso.

183
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:36,291
Smiling the whole time.

184
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:42,375
That awful feeling of his hand
on my heart, and I... I felt...

185
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,625
On the next <i>D. Gray-man</i> :

186
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,333
"Delete."
