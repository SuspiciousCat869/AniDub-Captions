1
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:58,500
Is there something wrong?

2
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:01,250
Somebody's come to the village.

3
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:10,208
It must be a mistake.

4
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,833
There's no reason for anyone
to have business here.

5
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,666
I hope you're right.

6
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,250
I'm worried my love.

7
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,958
What if someone were to come
here and cause us trouble?

8
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,291
Now, why would they do that?

9
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:26,166
You're right...
I'm overreacting...

10
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,958
No one can find us here.

11
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,750
So Allen, were you aware
that General Cross is missing?

12
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:09,333
We've been unable to contact
him for some time now.

13
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:12,416
Out of all the places to go
would he choose here...?

14
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,250
I hope not.

15
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,625
Excuse me!

16
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,875
Oh... Why hello there son...

17
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,333
It's quite rare
to see visitors here.

18
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,333
It's nice to meet you...

19
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:37,125
My name is Allen Walker.

20
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,291
Oh my...

21
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:42,208
There... is...
a crest... on your jacket!

22
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,458
Uh... yeah...

23
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,208
So what about it?

24
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,208
Wait...! You forgot
your cart thing...!

25
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,333
See you later...

26
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,333
That was strange.

27
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,916
Well this is great.

28
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,250
Uh...

29
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:24,041
Wait... Ho... Hold on...

30
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,041
I didn't do anything!

31
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,375
A vampire?

32
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,958
That's exactly right.

33
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,250
Uh... Too close.

34
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,916
Oh... Sorry.

35
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,500
It's okay.

36
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,375
Well... My name is George

37
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,125
and I am currently the
active mayor of this village...

38
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:07,291
I run a family business selling
meals at the station.

39
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:09,708
Tired?

40
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:10,750
No!

41
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,625
Were you aware
that a vampire lives

42
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,250
in this village of ours...?

43
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,416
He goes by the name
Count Arystar Krory.

44
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,291
You never see him
during the daylight,

45
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:23,583
and at night, horrific screams
pour out of the ancient castle.

46
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,916
It is said that those
that dare enter his lair,

47
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,291
are doomed to a terrible,
agonizing death.

48
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,166
Now wait...

49
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,666
Vampires don't really exist...

50
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,666
I'm sorry...

51
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,041
Please, sir, continue.

52
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,083
But it's not as bad as it seems.

53
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,458
As long as we keep a
distance from his castle,

54
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,083
Krory will not hurt us.

55
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,041
Huh?

56
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,583
The Count stayed in his castle

57
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:49,250
and we stayed in our village,
living in a bizarre harmony.

58
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,625
Until that one night.

59
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,416
The first victim
was an old woman

60
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,833
who had lived alone in
our village for decades.

61
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:25,500
He began to suck her blood
right in front of our eyes.

62
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:30,125
He didn't stop until her body
had completely evaporated.

63
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,541
Are you...

64
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,375
Count Krory?

65
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,583
Since that day Krory
has continued

66
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:51,958
attacking our people...

67
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,833
And there are no
signs of stopping.

68
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,833
Nine victims have
already become his prey.

69
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,208
Damn it, this has
gone on long enough!

70
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,916
A childhood friend of
mine was killed by Krory.

71
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,916
We must kill the vampire... now!

72
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,875
He's right--we all
want the Count's head!

73
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,166
This is disturbing.

74
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,833
We were planning
to lay down our lives

75
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,916
and storm the castle
to slay the Count...

76
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,375
However.

77
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:21,541
Our prayers are answered!

78
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,833
God has yet to abandon us.

79
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,208
As the prophecy said,
a monk dressed

80
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,291
in black bearing
the crest on his coat

81
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,333
would come to
exterminate the vampire!

82
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,125
We beg of you brother Monk...

83
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:37,916
Destroy Krory once and for
all so we may live in peace...

84
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,541
Won't you save us?!

85
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:41,583
Well see...

86
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:42,666
That's not the
reason I came here.

87
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,625
I traveled this way
to find someone.

88
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,458
Wait... What did you just say?

89
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,208
You're mistaken...

90
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,208
Tell me monk--why else
would you be in our village?

91
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,458
I'm looking for someone.

92
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,833
Oh... I see.

93
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,416
I'll show you.

94
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,750
Take a look at this.

95
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,416
His name is Cross Marian.

96
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,208
Do you recognize him?

97
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,458
Wait, what's wrong with you?

98
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,458
It was right...

99
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,375
The prophecy
was right after all!

100
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,333
Hey, take it easy!

101
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,000
It... It was true...!

102
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,291
The prophecy stated a monk
in black would save us,

103
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,041
and here you are in the flesh!

104
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,791
Would you mind letting
go of me... please?

105
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,375
So explain this prophecy.

106
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,166
This man told us about it...

107
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,125
Huh...? My master?

108
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,708
Yes...

109
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:38,916
It was in the weeks before Count
Krory began his killing spree...

110
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,500
A traveler appeared at
the edge of the village.

111
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:46,166
He asked us for the
way to Krory Castle...

112
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,416
We pleaded with
him to stay away,

113
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,041
telling how no one had
ever returned alive...

114
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:54,875
But he only laughed and
continued on his journey.

115
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,208
I tried to warn you!

116
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:02,166
After three days had passed
with no sign of the traveler,

117
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,583
I assumed he was dead.

118
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,083
But sure enough, there he was,

119
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:09,083
passing in front of my cart,
as if nothing had happened.

120
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,166
You're back...

121
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,125
You're alive!

122
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:15,416
Mister Food Peddler, let me
offer you a word of advice.

123
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,916
If that Count ever
decides to start acting

124
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
out in your village...

125
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,666
Notify someone
wearing similar clothing

126
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,333
and the crest that you
see here on this jacket...

127
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,333
They'll be able
to help you solve

128
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,250
any problems you may have...

129
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,958
Just have patience and one
will show up on this very train.

130
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,000
And with that, he
rode out of town...

131
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,541
Just as the man had predicted,

132
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,541
Count Krory began
his attacks soon after,

133
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:42,708
sending our village into
a state of constant terror.

134
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,791
Everything the
traveler said came true

135
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,750
like a prophecy
from God... And...

136
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,916
Just as he said, you
have come into our village

137
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,083
wearing the same clothing
and bearing the same emblem...

138
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,416
You're here to save us!

139
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,791
Hey... Are you even
listening to me?

140
00:09:55,875 --> 00:10:00,125
There's no denying it...
You are our savior!

141
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,375
Okay, just let go of me!

142
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,458
I'll do it. I'll do
anything just stop crying...

143
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:10,041
Please, that's... that's
really... That's enough...

144
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,625
Since it's late we've
made this room up

145
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,750
for you so you can
prepare for tomorrow...

146
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,000
And trust me there
will be much to do...

147
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:20,791
Good night, monk.

148
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,125
Uh... thanks.

149
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,000
I've never felt so
much pressure in my life.

150
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,750
I came here to
find Master Cross.

151
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,083
How could I let
myself get caught up

152
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,666
in this vampire business?

153
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,875
At least it was a nice attempt.

154
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,666
Sorry but my left
eye has the ability

155
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,916
to locate and detect Akuma...

156
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,333
I know you've been
watching me all night...

157
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,875
I was watching you
through the walls.

158
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,250
Damn!

159
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,958
I need to get out of this house!

160
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:28,916
Oh no.

161
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,583
I can't see out of my left eye!

162
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,875
Level Two Akuma...?! Ah great.

163
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:45,375
Big Hammer,
Little Hammer... Extend!

164
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,375
What the--?

165
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,125
Lavi and Bookman...!
Why are you...

166
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,375
Hey buddy, what
are you gawking at?

167
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,458
Your guard is down.

168
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,541
The hell...

169
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,208
Hey! What's with all
the racket up there?!

170
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,291
Ahh! This isn't fair!

171
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,750
What do you mean it's not fair?

172
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,416
Wait a sec, what are you
talking about, Short Stack?!

173
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,250
Cut it out--I'm not Short Stack!

174
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,625
It's gone.

175
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,000
Hold on!

176
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,708
What now...

177
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,500
Oh look, there are three
monks wearing black now.

178
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,375
This is very reassuring.

179
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,791
I heard you three
worked together

180
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,250
to repel the attack
last night by the...

181
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,083
They're called...

182
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,291
Akuma.

183
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,625
Yes, that's it...!
This is great...!

184
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:30,375
So you can kill Akuma
as well as vampires!

185
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,458
Well...

186
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,833
Actually we deal
exclusively with Akuma.

187
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,500
But Akuma and vampires
are one and the same.

188
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,166
I'll be back for you
later this evening

189
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,958
with the village security
watch to begin our journey.

190
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,041
What?

191
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,833
We're counting on
you to solve this!

192
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,958
That should do it...

193
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,958
Now... Let me
have a look at you...

194
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,291
Huh?

195
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,125
Allen, your eye needs
some medical attention...

196
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,000
Oh... sure.

197
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,416
It keeps getting injured.

198
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,416
You should take
better care of it.

199
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,750
There's almost no
moisture in the wound.

200
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,000
Is that bad?

201
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,708
I'm not quite sure what
could have caused this

202
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:18,458
but it appears your eye is dry
as a bone and utterly useless...

203
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:21,041
That Akuma was more
powerful than we had thought.

204
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,625
Ya think it'll heal up?

205
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:26,333
It should heal in the same
time as the one before...

206
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,708
Your eye has already
begun regenerating...

207
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,750
You should have full use
out of it very soon.

208
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,125
Thank you.

209
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,000
So...

210
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,250
What do we do now, Bookman?

211
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,875
Continue the search
for answers of course...

212
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,625
We're all concerned about
the Akuma attack last night

213
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,125
and if General Cross
came to this town

214
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,333
he must have had a
good reason to do so.

215
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,333
In order to find out his reason

216
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,791
you must go to that castle
and confront the vampire.

217
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,541
Good point.

218
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,166
You should be alright
doing this on your own,

219
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,541
even with one eye.

220
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,041
Lavi, you know
you're going with him.

221
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,625
What?!!

222
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,375
It's all part of your training.

223
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,125
So... You are...

224
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,250
Staying with him.

225
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,083
I'll fend off any pesky Akuma...

226
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,583
Oh, fine...

227
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:12,791
I'll go then...

228
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,166
You old panda.

229
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,958
Who are you calling a panda,
you red headed fool?!

230
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:20,541
And while I'm on the subject,
stop calling me old!

231
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,916
How's that eye of yours
doing...? Can you see?

232
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
No... but I'll have
to manage without it.

233
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:37,875
So...

234
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,458
Have you heard about this...?

235
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,250
If you get bitten by a vampire
you will actually turn into one.

236
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,708
I have heard of that before.

237
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,708
If that happens
our friendship's over...

238
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,416
'Cause... I'm not gonna put up

239
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,916
with the whole sucking
blood thing, ya know?

240
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,208
You can stop.
I know that already.

241
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:00,583
What is it?

242
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:01,958
Uhh...

243
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,250
Nothing.

244
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,916
Ya know I just had a thought...

245
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,750
We were attacked
by Akuma last night...

246
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,208
Do you think it's a
possibility an Akuma is posing

247
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,583
as a vampire to
lure us to the castle?

248
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:15,083
Maybe but I've never heard of
a blood-sucking Akuma before.

249
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,291
Oh right...

250
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,625
You have a point there.

251
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:20,458
Speaking of which,
I meant to ask you something.

252
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,625
You and Bookman just sort
of appeared out of nowhere...

253
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,333
What is it that
brought you out here?

254
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,166
Ohh... That's right...

255
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,500
You see, uhh...

256
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:29,708
Both of you!

257
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,958
Stop where you are!

258
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:39,708
Look... up there.

259
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:40,541
This is it...

260
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,625
The gate to Krory Castle...

261
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,833
Behind this gate
lies the Krory Garden,

262
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:51,000
where it's said that Akuma
can be found in great numbers...

263
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:54,333
And beyond there, at
the summit, lies the castle,

264
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:58,291
where the Count himself
is awaiting our arrival.

265
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,208
Thanks for the pep talk.

266
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,166
Did you just... hear something?

267
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,500
I sure did.

268
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,416
Well...? Go in.

269
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:27,833
Let's go.

270
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,166
Whoever this Krory guy is,

271
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,958
he has really
strange taste in art.

272
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,208
Hey Allen...

273
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,291
What's up...?
You took your glove off.

274
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,666
Is there something
we should know about?

275
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,416
Or are you scared?!

276
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,625
Don't be silly.

277
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,500
And what about you, Lavi?

278
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,375
It looks your hand is
getting a little twitchy.

279
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:33,041
I ain't scared of
this Krory character!

280
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,500
Is something wrong?

281
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,916
Shh! We have company.

282
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,708
It's getting close.

283
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,125
Was that...?

284
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:14,083
It's fast!

285
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:14,625
Smell that?

286
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:15,583
Yes, I can...

287
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,375
It's like a kind of sweetness.

288
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,375
He... He got Franz!

289
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,625
What happened?

290
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,166
He took Franz
over there... look!

291
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,291
What?

292
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,083
It... It's him!

293
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,250
No way!

294
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,666
That's him?!

295
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,833
It's Count Arystar Krory!

296
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,916
So he's... not an Akuma.

297
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,916
Oh yeah... that'd
be a vampire...

298
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,916
Agreed... he's a vampire...

299
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,583
Count Krory gets the jump on me
and ends up sucking my blood,

300
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:43,500
causing his appearance
to transform.

301
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:45,041
Once we follow
him into the castle,

302
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:47,333
we find something
we weren't expecting...

303
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:48,833
a beautiful woman!

304
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:52,750
Next time on D. Gray-man:
"Go For It, Exorcists."

305
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:56,291
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul.
