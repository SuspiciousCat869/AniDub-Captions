1
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,083
All units be advised
that a swarm of Akuma

2
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,500
have appeared in
the mountains...

3
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,041
From the direction
they're traveling;

4
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,125
they're headed to Barcelona!

5
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:57,708
Everyone be careful!

6
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:03,666
Hurry up...! You've got
to find the General!

7
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,333
Get moving...! The Akuma
will be here by nightfall!

8
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,041
What's the situation
in the other zones?

9
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,833
Still no word
from the port, sir...

10
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,875
We're completely out of
reinforcements to send.

11
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,875
Then we'll go ourselves.

12
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,583
I'm with the Finders
from Germany...

13
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,041
My name's Devon.

14
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,541
Right...

15
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,208
Thanks for coming, we can
use all the help we can get...

16
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:45,833
For starters...

17
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:46,916
The bay...

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,291
Take your unit and
get down there...

19
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,458
Keep the area under control.

20
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,166
Yes, sir!

21
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,291
Get whoever you can
and set up a perimeter...

22
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,875
No one in this
village is allowed in

23
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,083
or out until morning...!

24
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,083
Is that understood?

25
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,625
Yes, sir!

26
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,000
Hurry, run...!

27
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:11,041
Once it's closed, it stays
closed until tomorrow!

28
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:11,708
All right...!

29
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,083
Close it!

30
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,875
Hey, Dad. Are we there yet?

31
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,541
No, son. Not yet.

32
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,166
Don't worry... At this
rate we'll be in Vilanova

33
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,708
by morning at the latest.

34
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,166
No way...!

35
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,583
I feel like we've been
on the road forever!

36
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,583
I thought we'd be there by lunch

37
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,708
so we could go somewhere
in town to eat!

38
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,625
Dad! Tellima!

39
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,916
Somebody's out here!

40
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,125
Right over there!

41
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,791
Maybe he's a shepherd.

42
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,958
If he's a shepherd,
where are all his sheep?

43
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:30,083
What an absolutely
wonderful view from here.

44
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,833
He must be crazy or he
wouldn't wear those clothes.

45
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,333
They are weird.

46
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,583
Akuma, huh?

47
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,708
They passed this way
earlier this morning...

48
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,291
Which means we have
to pick up the pace

49
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,125
if we want to catch up to them.

50
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,125
Get down!

51
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:01,041
Ow ow ow ow...!
What are you doing?!

52
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,833
You see that?

53
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,916
Looks like it's
coming from the shore.

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,041
Let's go.

55
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,416
Right.

56
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,166
Come on... Hurry up!

57
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,875
That you, Kanda and Daisya?

58
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,333
Oh, it's you.

59
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,416
Here I was worrying about

60
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,041
what could be
taking you so long...

61
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,333
I should've known you'd be
slacking off somewhere...

62
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,000
I swore not to rest
'til we found you!

63
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:37,666
Daisya...

64
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,541
Shut up.

65
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,958
What do you hear?

66
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,166
A hundred...

67
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,833
Two hundred...

68
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:51,208
There are more than I can count
and I can count pretty high...

69
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,458
But there's a lot of them.

70
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,125
They're miles ahead of us...

71
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:58,083
They'll probably make it
to Barcelona by nightfall.

72
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,291
Whoa...!

73
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,333
There's no way we'll
make it by nightfall,

74
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,291
I don't care how fast we run!

75
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,916
How bout the General?

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,666
It's hard to say...

77
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,666
Hold on...

78
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,708
I think he's near there, too.

79
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,208
Then, dammit, let's go!

80
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,375
Wait.

81
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,291
Ta-da!

82
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,625
I almost forgot we
could get there by sea!

83
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,416
Way to go, Marie!

84
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,416
Let's get going.

85
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,166
Right.

86
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,250
Hey...!

87
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,500
Wait for me...!
You guys...! Hold on!

88
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,958
General Tiedoll should
be here by now.

89
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,416
Captain!

90
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,416
Very well, then...

91
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,500
That'll be all for now.

92
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,666
Yes, sir.

93
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,875
Men...

94
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,250
I just received word
that the army of Akuma

95
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,791
will be closing
in on us shortly.

96
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,666
Unfortunately, we
still haven't been able

97
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,333
to locate General Tiedoll...

98
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:15,375
But, in order to protect
the citizens of Barcelona,

99
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,583
we have no choice but to try

100
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:19,583
to hold the enemy
back ourselves.

101
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,666
Exorcists have been dispatched
to our location for support ...

102
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,791
Our only hope is to keep

103
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,041
the Akuma at bay
until they arrive...

104
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,458
It won't be easy but we don't
have any other options...

105
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,750
We'll do what has to be done.

106
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,250
So here's the plan...

107
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,791
I want all barrier units to
set up along the north gate

108
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,208
and await further instruction.

109
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,583
Right.

110
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,083
All other units, return
to your posts and stand by.

111
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,750
Right!

112
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,500
Guess it's back to
this life for now...

113
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,958
Well, don't these
look delicious?

114
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,250
Thank you very much.

115
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,791
Thank you, sir...

116
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:05,875
I'm shutting down
the shop early today,

117
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,458
so take another if you like.

118
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,041
Don't mind if I do...

119
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:13,625
I'll certainly need the energy
for the trip I'm about to take.

120
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:14,791
Is that so...?

121
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,291
Where are you going
to hide until then?

122
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,416
What are you talking about?

123
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,291
Some very important
people went around

124
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,291
telling everyone
to find someplace safe

125
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,791
to hide for the night.

126
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:28,041
That's why every merchant
in town is closing up early.

127
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,166
I'll keep an eye out
for trouble, thank you.

128
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,166
You really don't
get it, do you...?

129
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,708
Might as well take another apple
for that journey of yours.

130
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,333
Thanks again.

131
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,291
Papa says you must be
pretty thirsty, Mister...

132
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,625
So here... I brought
you some wine.

133
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,916
Ah... Thank you.

134
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,750
Hey, Mister... You can
draw anything, huh?

135
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:15,875
That depends.

136
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,000
Do you have anything
specific in mind?

137
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,083
I don't know...

138
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,875
Wait! How about
the city of Barcelona?

139
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,833
Ah... Is Barcelona where
you're all headed now?

140
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,750
Tonight we're going to
be staying in Vilanova...

141
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,333
Barcelona is tomorrow.

142
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,708
The beautiful
city of Barcelona...

143
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:36,625
If I remember correctly,
it looks something like this.

144
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,833
They're here!

145
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,250
Here they come!

146
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,208
Contain them!

147
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:50,625
Where do we stand?

148
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:51,833
There are two
more on the right...

149
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,041
No, wait!

150
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,208
Looks like they're
stopping here... and...

151
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,125
There's three
approaching from the left!

152
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:56,958
No!

153
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,166
They've stopped moving, too!

154
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,583
Don't let your guard down...!

155
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,875
We may not be able to
destroy these Akuma...

156
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,958
But we can hold them back
until reinforcements arrive!

157
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,958
What now?

158
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,458
Oh my god...!

159
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,125
They're coming up
from under the ground!

160
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,375
Get down!

161
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,166
They've broken
through the barrier!

162
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,375
Dammit.

163
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,916
All units...! Look sharp...!

164
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,916
The Akuma have
broken the perimeter...!

165
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,625
Stand your ground!

166
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:39,916
Yes, sir!

167
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,791
Let's go... Come on...!

168
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,166
Everyone
back to your post...

169
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:53,666
City Hall Unit's wiped
out...! Please advise!

170
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,416
Central Square Unit's been
almost completely annihilated!

171
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,208
The Akuma are closing
in on the marketplace!

172
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,666
All units that can
still fight, will fight!

173
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,166
Survivors of the attacked units,

174
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,250
make your way to the historic
district and find shelter!

175
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,791
Captain...!
We gotta find a way out!

176
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,250
There isn't a way out...

177
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,416
The Akuma have us trapped here.

178
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,833
This is Devon Unit
at the harbor district!

179
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,625
Send backup...!
We're completely surrounded!

180
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,333
We have no more units to send...

181
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,875
I'm sorry.

182
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:51,750
Looks like this is it.

183
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,083
But sir--!

184
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,708
Why can't you guys just learn
to start playing nice with us!

185
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,916
They all exploded!

186
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,125
Look!

187
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,083
They're finally here!

188
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,791
Innocence... Activate!

189
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,375
Netherworld Creature Indicate!

190
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,208
All right, I'm done
playing nice...

191
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,041
Charity bell...! Shoot!

192
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,291
The Verse... of the Saint.

193
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,291
Shoot!

194
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,458
I think we're all gonna be okay!

195
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,041
Demons will appear?

196
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,583
Yeah...

197
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,166
I've heard rumors from some
of the other traveling merchants

198
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,916
that demons have been popping
up all around Barcelona lately.

199
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,708
That's why Papa thought
it would be better

200
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:57,916
if we all stayed in Vilanova
for the night, where it's safe.

201
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,166
It may turn out to be
nothing, but it doesn't hurt

202
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,583
being a little cautious
until we're sure.

203
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:10,333
It's possible... that
there are demons nearby.

204
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,583
Are you going somewhere, Mister?

205
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,916
Yes...

206
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,625
I suddenly remembered something
very important I have to do.

207
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,000
Those demons that Papa
was telling us about...

208
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,583
It's about them, isn't it?

209
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,875
You should stay here
with Papa and us!

210
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,541
Ruben is right!

211
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,458
I didn't want to frighten
you by mentioning it,

212
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,375
but those demons
might be looking for me.

213
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,750
The last thing I want is to
cause trouble for your family,

214
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,625
but that's exactly what
you'll get if I stay...

215
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,625
You understand, don't you?

216
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,541
You're pretty old so
you should be careful...

217
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,708
If you see a demon,
run the other way!

218
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,083
That's good advice...

219
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,458
Be safe you two...

220
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:19,833
I'll be saying an
extra special prayer

221
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,250
that those demons
don't ever find you!

222
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,791
Yeah, me too!

223
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,791
Well, there goes that
whole stick-together,

224
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,083
there's-safety-in-numbers plan.

225
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,625
I had no idea there'd
be so many of them...

226
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,208
They just keep coming.

227
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,000
Yeah.

228
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,250
Aw, man.

229
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,083
Anybody else starving?

230
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,333
Daisya... You're breaking up.

231
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,791
I assume you both found
good spots to lay low?

232
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,750
I found a place about
three kilometers east

233
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,958
of that big,
crazy-looking tower.

234
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,375
Let me think...

235
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,875
I'd say I'm about five
kilometers to the west of it.

236
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,875
I'm in the southern
part of the city.

237
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,041
Great...

238
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,541
This is shaping up
to be one long night.

239
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,041
I hear Akuma in every direction.

240
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,750
Still no telling how many.

241
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,666
This whole city is
crawling with them!

242
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,791
Let's try to meet up...

243
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,166
Stay within ten kilometers,

244
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,666
and use our Golems to
track each other's location.

245
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,083
Then why doesn't Old Man Marie

246
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,666
just sit tight while us young
bucks go track him down?

247
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,958
When will you be here?

248
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,708
Expect us by dawn.

249
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,916
Okay, then!

250
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,208
Innocence... Activate!

251
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,458
Shoot!

252
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,791
You'll need a bigger
bullet to destroy me...

253
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,541
It's adorable, though.

254
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,416
Ta-da!

255
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,875
No...! What did you do to me?

256
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,208
It might be small but its
got it where it counts...

257
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,375
Destroying enemies from
the inside with sound waves.

258
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,625
Enjoy your short life as a bell.

259
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,041
He's done it again...

260
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,583
Why does the
Millennium Earl insist

261
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,333
we meet so far off
the beaten path?

262
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,708
Almost forgot about this one.

263
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,125
Ta-da!

264
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:36,416
Good evening... Exorcist.

265
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,458
Would you look at
that, a human...!

266
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:41,500
You wouldn't happen to
be an Akuma in disguise?

267
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:42,750
No...

268
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,166
Not exactly.

269
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,333
What's a human doing in a
dangerous place like this,

270
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,666
if you don't mind me asking?

271
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:53,583
Your name...

272
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,250
What should I call you?

273
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,666
It's Daisya...

274
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,625
My name's Daisya Barry.

275
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,666
You're not the one.

276
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,125
This doesn't concern
you, my friend.

277
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,125
Now if you don't mind,
I really should be going...

278
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,416
See you around...

279
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,875
So sorry...

280
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:21,291
But I can't shake the feeling
that you're no ordinary human.

281
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:24,375
How about you tell me a
little bit about yourself?

282
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,875
So much for self-restraint.

283
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:33,791
You see...

284
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,916
I only have so much patience...

285
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,791
Yes... Yes...

286
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,500
But that can't be...! Of course.

287
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,416
Yes, I understand.

288
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,250
You look upset,
is there something wrong?

289
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:01,041
Come on, we should hurry.

290
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,625
Why was the Black Order
contacting you here?

291
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,666
They wanted us to be
aware that armies of Akuma

292
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,250
from all over the world
have started mobilizing.

293
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,125
They say every Akuma
in southern Europe

294
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,500
is now heading towards
Barcelona... Fast.

295
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,041
Barcelona?

296
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,375
Remember Devon and the Finders
we met on the way to Spain?

297
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,125
He said they were
going to Barcelona!

298
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,375
Then that's exactly
where we're going, too!

299
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,041
Right!

300
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:27,208
I'm really going
to enjoy killing you.

301
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,041
Daisya?

302
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,250
What the...? Dammit!

303
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,708
You say something, Daisya...?
Are you there?

304
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,916
The city of Barcelona has
turned into a battlefield.

305
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,500
The fight between Tyki from
the Clan of Noah and Daisya,

306
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:48,291
Exorcist of the
Black Order, begins.

307
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:52,750
On the next episode of
D. Gray-man: "Silent Coffins."

308
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:56,375
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul!
