1
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,875
[ALLEN]
The moon.

2
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:47,458
Even down here it looks so big.

3
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:53,666
[ALLEN]
I'm not ready.

4
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,541
Don't come for me.

5
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:02,916
[ALLEN]
I'm alive. Still alive.

6
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,791
[ALLEN]
Not yet.

7
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:20,916
[LAVI]
Are you okay, Lenalee?

8
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,250
You look worn out.

9
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,583
[LENALEE]
I'm fine.

10
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:29,666
All that matters now...
is finding them.

11
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,625
There was this big beam
of light in the sky.

12
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,958
We've been looking so hard.

13
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,666
Where could those two be?!

14
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,875
We will find them.

15
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,208
[LAVI gasps]

16
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,083
[AKUMA A]
Not so fast, golden Golem!

17
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm gonna shoot you down!
Have some of this! [laughs]

18
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,791
Damn, we got ourselves
a quick one!

19
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,041
He might even be
faster than Lero!

20
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,541
[AKUMA A]
Oh, really?

21
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,708
Well, even if he is, he can't
outrun my homing missiles!

22
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,333
[AKUMA]
Got you now!

23
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,708
[LENALEE yells]

24
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,375
Timcanpy!

25
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,916
Oh, no. She's an Exorcist.

26
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,708
--We were close.
--My precious ammo!

27
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:58,833
[AKUMA gasping]

28
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,375
[LAVI]
Devouring Flame...

29
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:01,750
[AKUMA groaning]

30
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,666
[LAVI]
...Fire Stamp!

31
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,958
[AKUMA scream]

32
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,750
You're safe!

33
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,916
[LENALEE]
I'm so glad.

34
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,291
Allen. Do you know where he is?

35
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,541
Is he with Suman, or...?

36
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,916
[BOTH gasp]

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,875
[LAVI]
Innocence. Is Allen--

38
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:34,750
No way. It's not his.
This one belongs to Suman.

39
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,333
Nobody's here.

40
00:04:57,125 --> 00:05:01,041
[LAVI] Wait. Tim,
tell us what's going on!

41
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,166
[ALLEN screaming]

42
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,375
[BOTH gasp]

43
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,875
Oh no, Allen! He's in pain!

44
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:15,458
[ALLEN screaming]

45
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,666
[gasps]

46
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:26,708
This is where that beam of
light was coming from before.

47
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,375
[LAVI]
What happened?

48
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,291
Suman!

49
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:37,708
We actually saved you,
Suman! Now you can--

50
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,500
[ALLEN gasping]

51
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,750
[ALLEN]
His soul. It's gone.

52
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:48,958
Why? Why did this happen?

53
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,500
[ALLEN cries]
Tell me why!

54
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,250
So does that mean Suman...?

55
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:57,791
It doesn't look good,
but he's still alive.

56
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:00,333
It's okay.

57
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,625
Uh?!

58
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:07,166
What?! No! Allen saved
him, so... why...?

59
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:13,583
It's him!

60
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,958
Sweet Dreams, boy.

61
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,708
[ALLEN grunts]

62
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,000
[LENALEE]
It's horrible.

63
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,958
[LAVI] So this is what
a Noah's capable of.

64
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:28,125
[ALLEN screaming]

65
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,291
[BOTH gasp]

66
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,500
Don't do it!

67
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,916
[LENALEE gasping]

68
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,125
[LAVI]
Allen's Innocence...

69
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,291
[LENALEE sobs]
No.

70
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:49,500
[ALLEN]
You can't stay. You have to.

71
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:53,791
If you stay here, who's going
to help them find my master?

72
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,500
Now, go.

73
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,583
It's up to you.

74
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,250
Poor Allen.

75
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:13,000
[LAVI exhales]
It doesn't seem like he made it.

76
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:19,041
I guess this must be
where they parted ways.

77
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:22,416
Allen met with a Noah, and
it destroyed his left arm.

78
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,333
The only thing he could do
was save Suman's Innocence.

79
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:33,375
[LENALEE]
It's blood...

80
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:36,958
He was right here.

81
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,916
But now, he's gone.

82
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,958
[LENALEE]
How are we going to find him?

83
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,458
[BOOKMAN]
Can you hear me, Lavi?

84
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,916
Uh-huh.

85
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,583
[BOOKMAN] Come back. There's
a messenger at the harbor.

86
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:00,791
What for?

87
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,875
[BOOKMAN] Just get here
as soon as you can.

88
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,125
On our way.

89
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:08,000
[LENALEE cries]

90
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,250
Hey, Lenalee.

91
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,916
We'll have to put the
search on hold for now.

92
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:35,458
[WONG] So we meet again, Miss
Lenalee. It's been a while.

93
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:39,000
Wait. You came from
the Asian Branch.

94
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:42,291
[WONG] My name is Wong. I came
here as quickly as I could

95
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,250
to deliver an important message
from our branch chief.

96
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,833
And what's that?

97
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,375
[WONG] I have come to inform you
that your associate Allen Walker

98
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:53,541
was recently located
and taken into our care.

99
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,291
You have him?

100
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,708
[WONG]
Yes.

101
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,583
Tell me! Is Allen doing okay?

102
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:02,333
Please, Wong, I need to talk
to him as soon as possible!

103
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,625
I'm afraid you and your unit
must leave this place at once.

104
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:06,791
[LENALEE]
What?

105
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,208
[WONG] I hope you've
said your goodbyes,

106
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:11,791
because you need to
leave immediately.

107
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,041
Our goodbyes?

108
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:17,500
What are you saying?
Is he dead already?

109
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,541
I know that it's
difficult to hear,

110
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,041
but you need to do as I ask.

111
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,250
[LENALEE whimpers]

112
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:28,583
Lenalee. You saw Tim's memory
just the same as I did.

113
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,416
Allen lost his left arm
back there, remember?

114
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,916
That alone means he can't
be an Exorcist anymore.

115
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,708
We have to accept
that and move on.

116
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,250
But, sir.

117
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:44,375
Our ship took quite a bit of
damage in last night's battle.

118
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,916
We can't set sail now.

119
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,333
We'll need time for repairs.

120
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,208
[WONG]
That's no problem.

121
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,208
You'll be glad to know
a new Exorcist

122
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,333
has just arrived
from headquarters.

123
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:01,041
With her help, you can be
ready to go in no time.

124
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,208
[gasps]

125
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:07,500
[WONG] I'd like you
to meet Miranda Lotto.

126
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,625
Miranda Lotto?

127
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:26,500
[MIRANDA yelping]

128
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,541
[ALL sigh]

129
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:32,750
[ALL]
Uh!

130
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,250
[gasping]

131
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,250
[laughs nervously]

132
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:41,916
Everyone, please stand
back for one moment.

133
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,041
[MIRANDA]
I can do this.

134
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,958
[MIRANDA]
My Anti-Akuma weapon was made

135
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,916
from that special
clock, after all.

136
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,708
[MIRANDA]
Time Record! Innocence activate!

137
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,666
Target confirmed!

138
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,250
From now until I deactivate,

139
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:11,000
the effects of time on
my target will vanish!

140
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,083
Recovery!

141
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,458
[sighs]

142
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,666
[MIRANDA]
Okay, it worked!

143
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,916
Uh?

144
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,916
[ALL gasping]

145
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,250
[WONG]
Heh!

146
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,583
[MIRANDA]
Uh? Wh-What's wrong?

147
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,666
[gasps]

148
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,916
[MIRANDA]
Wait.

149
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,708
Maybe they didn't want
me to repair the ship!

150
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:57,625
I'm new here. I should've
asked permission first!

151
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:01,458
Ahh! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

152
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:02,375
[splash]

153
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,083
[KRORY]
Oh. I hope she can swim.

154
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,125
[WONG]
What are you doing?

155
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:10,625
[MIRANDA] Forget about me!
Leave me here to die! [gurgles]

156
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,791
[LAVI]
Uh-oh, I think she's drowning.

157
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,125
[BOOKMAN]
Then go save her!

158
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,375
[LAVI]
Me?!

159
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,375
Uh!

160
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,458
[splash]

161
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:24,041
[LAVI yelping]
Guys, I'm still injured!

162
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,833
[BOOKMAN]
Oh, I'm sorry, Lavi. I forgot.

[LAVI]
It's so light and flexible!

166
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,791
I hope that means that you
like the new uniforms.

167
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,916
Headquarters said yours
would be worn out by now

168
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,208
so they had me bring
you some more.

169
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:53,041
[KOMUI] We made these to give
you a little extra protection.

[gasps] Lenalee...

171
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,833
I think she's having
trouble accepting this.

172
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,166
My guess is she feels guilty

173
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,666
about leaving Allen's
side last night.

174
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,625
She blames herself
for what happened.

175
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:27,416
[ANITA] Exorcists certainly
are exceptional people.

176
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,833
I can see why they're
called "God's Apostles,"

177
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,583
don't you agree?

178
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,541
[MAHOJA]
Yes, thinking about last night.

179
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,333
If the Exorcists
hadn't been with us,

180
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,791
who knows how many
might've died.

181
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,916
We would've been
defeated for sure.

182
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,500
[ANITA laughs]
You may be right,

183
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,208
but when you were going around
kicking those Akuma,

184
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,791
I thought I might fall for you.

185
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,875
Please don't tease me like that.

186
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:54,416
I can kick those things, but
still, I can't destroy them.

187
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,666
I suppose it's not all bad.

188
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,208
[ANITA]
Uh?

189
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,958
After you heard the news that
the general had passed away,

190
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,375
you were in a daze,
like some kind of zombie.

191
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:06,041
And there was nothing I could
do to ease your pain.

192
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,625
But at least for now,

193
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:11,333
it looks like I'll be able
to assist you in some way.

194
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,708
[ANITA] Thank you for
coming with me, Mahoja.

it came from the room

I've told you a million times!

There was nothing we could do!

We fought as hard as
we could last night.

enough to save him!

[LAVI groans]

216
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,333
[BOOKMAN] Do you think
you're one of them, boy?

217
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:18,500
You are the successor to a
Bookman, no more, and no less.

218
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,791
You are not an Apostle of God.

219
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,250
Have I not always taught you

220
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:25,750
that your role is as a
bystander, not a participant?

221
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,666
In the secret history,
there is always war.

222
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,458
War is what moves
history forward.

223
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,458
It is the Bookman's
responsibility

224
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,875
to observe these conflicts
from the sidelines

225
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,375
and record
them objectively,

226
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:41,250
without involving themselves
with either side.

227

Don't get caught up in the war.

228
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:46,041
The only reason we happen
to be on the Order's side

229
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,958
is to record.

230
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:51,083
Do not forget your
purpose, Lavi.

231
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:56,958
I get it. Jeez. Sorry, panda--

[LAVI groaning]

233
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,708
Well, if you ask me,

234
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:05,916
Allen Walker was prophesied to
be the "Destroyer of Time",

235
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,458
wasn't he?

236
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,833
It's difficult to believe that
he's been defeated already.

237
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,833
My interest in that boy was the
main reason I begged the chief

238
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:16,500
to assign us to the Cross
unit in the first place.

239
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,250
After all, he was called
the "Destroyer of Time"

240
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:23,125
and I had my own ideas
about what that meant.

241
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:29,125
[BOOKMAN]
A millennium is a unit of time.

242
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,875
[BOOKMAN] Perhaps that
could mean he is the one

243
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:36,583
who's destined to destroy
the Millennium Earl.

244
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:41,458
And if my theory is correct,
he can't die yet, can he?

See? I can fix it!

259
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,916
It's just as good as new!

260
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,958
Right. As long as my
Innocence remains active,

261
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,916
the space around this
vessel won't be affected

262
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
by the passage of time at all.

263
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,250
If anything is damaged,

264
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,958
it should revert to its
original condition.

265
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,375
That also means that while
this area is protected

266
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,958
by my abilities, everyone
aboard will recover

267
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,875
from any injuries
we may sustain.

268
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,625
[ALL gasp]

269
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,625
That's a very convenient skill.

270
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:45,875
[MIRANDA] No. The effect
is only temporary.

271
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,416
If you do have to fight,

272
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,250
please don't be reckless just
because we're on this ship.

273
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,875
Fortunately, while I
was at headquarters,

274
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,916
I learned to increase
the synchro-rate

275
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,375
using Time Record to extend
the activation time.

276
00:17:58,458 --> 00:17:59,791
But once it deactivates,

277
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,875
everything will
go back to its flawed state.

278
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,458
Additionally, if you die,

279
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,458
I don't have the ability to
rewind time to bring you back.

280
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:10,791
That's good to know. I'll
tell the crew right away.

281
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:15,166
You know, Miranda, I can't help
but be concerned about you.

282

[MIRANDA]
Why?

283
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,833
Even if we don't
encounter a problem,

284
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,875
it'll take at least five
days to arrive in Japan.

285
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,625
Do you plan on staying
awake the entire journey?

286
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:24,958
Oh yeah, that's right!

287
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,833
You can't sleep while
your Innocence is active!

288
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:30,208
Oh. Well, I'm not all that
good at sleeping anyway.

289
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,458
There was a time when
I lost a lot of jobs.

290
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:35,000
I couldn't stop thinking about
how incompetent I must be,

291
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,250
so I didn't sleep for
about ten days straight.

292
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,875
I was pretty nervous about
today being my first mission,

293
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:43,083
but I only lost about three
nights of sleep, so I'm fine.

294
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,583

This place doesn't feel real.

299

Am I dead?

00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,333
Is this where people
go when they die?

301
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,166
[ALLEN]
The moon in the sky is white,

302
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,541
but the reflection
is pitch black.

wreckage? No, it can't be.

Was there a war?

I'm alive.

00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:56,250
I'm back. But how?

319
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:33,291
[ALLEN] When I came back
from the dark pit of death,

320
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:36,041
I was greeted by a fear
I couldn't shake,

321
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:41,500
and the feeling of hopelessness
from having lost my Innocence.

322
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:43,750
On the next <i>D. Gray-Man</i> :

323
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,708
"Asian Branch."

324
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,208
[gasping] Where did Allen go?

325
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:54,416
Where did everyone go?
This is my fault!

326
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,125
Miranda's freaking
out, as usual.
