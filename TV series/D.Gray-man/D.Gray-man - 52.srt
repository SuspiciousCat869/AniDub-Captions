I'm accumulating a nice pile.

Although I do find
it disappointing

25
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,791
that none of your names

No! Stay away!

Well. Looks like
he's finally awake.

Hey, mister. You feel okay?

00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:17,000
[FAN'S MOTHER] He's probably
too thirsty to speak.

34
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,166
Fan. Go fetch some water.

Hurry up, people!

00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:06,416
The longer you take, the later
we ship out, now move it!

41
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,125
Let's get that food stored
below deck on the double!

42
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:13,000
Careful there. We haven't
even set sail yet.

43
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,291
[CREW D]
Yes, ma'am!

44
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,833
[MAHOJA]
Luck is on our side.

45
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,666
We've finished checking the
engine. No problems were found.

46
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,291
Once the crew finishes loading
the remaining supply of food

47
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,541
and water, we can
depart at any time.

48
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,250
See if we can move faster.

49
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,500
I'd prefer if we left
as soon as possible.

50
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,500
Whatever you desire, Master.

51
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,791
I can't thank you enough.

52
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,041
There's really no need
for gratitude.

53
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:43,083
As supporters of the Black Order
you can always count on us

54
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,625
to assist the Exorcists,
whatever the cost.

55
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,375
Even so, the voyage
will be treacherous.

56
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:49,916
I'm aware of the risks.

57
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,500
As was Marian before
he took his voyage.

58
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,833
[LENALEE]
That's right.

59
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:59,416
The ship General Cross was
aboard was sunk by Akuma.

60
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,625
It was a despicable
act ordered by

61
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,875
the Millennium Earl and
the Noah who are trying

62
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:07,666
to destroy the shard of
Innocence called the Heart.

63
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,166
The Heart,

64
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,291
it's the source of the power
of all the Innocence pieces.

65
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,208
And has the ability to
reduce them to rubble.

66
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,791
If the Millennium Earl
recovers the Heart before us

67
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,416
and destroys it, all
the shards of Innocence

68
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,125
around the world
will be shattered.

69
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,250
No need to look worried.

70
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,708
I know Cross Marian and I
guarantee it would take more

71
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,875
than some shipwreck
to keep him dead.

72
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,291
Allen was his apprentice
so he understands.

73
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,875
Cross is still alive.

74
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,208
[LENALEE exhales]

75
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,958
The one thing that
remains to be seen

76
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,958
is whether the Innocence he's
carrying really is the Heart.

77
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,208
Whatever the case may be,

78
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,666
we need to locate him
as soon as we can.

79
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,000
You know,

80
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,000
I've helped the Order from
the shadows for years.

81
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,833
I'm happy to finally work
alongside Exorcists.

82
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,458
It's an honor, and well,

83
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,541
I'm happy for the opportunity
to be closer to my love.

84
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,500
You really miss him.

85
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,166
[ANITA] Uh... Please pretend
you didn't hear that.

86
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,500
Even if it's true, a supporter
speaking that way

87
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,750
about an Exorcist
is inappropriate.

88
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:05,833
Not at all.

89
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:09,083
It's fine. You'll see him soon.

90
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,291
[YANG]
Come on! You're holding us up!

91
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:15,583

the longer we stay docked!

That's Allen and the others.

on making us earn our passage.

deckhands we have helping

97
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,833
the quicker we can leave,
don't you agree?

98
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,333
[ALLEN]
I see your point, but still.

99
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,458
[LENALEE]
Thanks for your hard work!

Oh. Lenalee.

Hold on, Allen. Let me
see your left arm.

102

Oh man! Why's it crumbling?

103
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,375
Even I find that morbid.

104
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:48,833
Stop worrying! I'm fine.

105
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,916
I promise, it looks
worse than it is, guys.

106
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,541
I've been fighting a lot lately

107
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,375
and I guess my weapon
finally got tired.

108
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,583
It just needs a little
rest, that's all.

109
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,250
This is the first time
I've heard of a weapon

110
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,416
getting exhausted.

111
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,583
Maybe 'cuz I'm a Parasite
Type Exorcist?

112
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,583
You're just making
up excuses now!

113
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:05,833
Whatever the reason,

114
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,750
it is true that you're
fighting twice as much

115
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,583
as we are, thanks to
that eye of yours.

116

[LENALEE] It's not a
laughing matter, Allen.

This is exactly what
I was afraid of.

118

Your left arm is fragile.

Yeah!

Hey, Timcanpy.

00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:07,916
You think we can find my
Master once we cross the ocean?

131
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,250
He has no idea the effort
everyone is putting into

132
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:13,083
finding him.
Not that he'd care.

I'll never forgive you.

The Akuma wasted no time
deciding to halt our progress.

There's not enough of 'em.

not their intended target.

[ALLEN grunts]

163
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:06,791
[ALLEN]
Wherever they're headed,

164
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,458
we can't let them reach
their destination!

165
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,083
[AKUMA A]
Just as I suspected.

166
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,750
I knew they were Exorcists!

167
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,458
You can tell by the black coats.
A dead giveaway.

168
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,125
No one's got better
vision than you!

169
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,041
[AKUMA A]
Watch it!

170
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,416
[AKUMA B]
Whoa!

171
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,416
Man, they're fast!

172
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,416
Hang on, Allen! I'm coming!

173
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,750
[AKUMA C]
This ship is full of Exorcists!

174
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,000
[AKUMA D]
What'd you say?

175
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,250
[AKUMA E]
Not only that,

176
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,708
it's filled with humans
ripe for the picking!

177
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:40,125
So hard to choose
who to kill first!

178
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,833
[AKUMA groan]

179

[ANITA]
Don't underestimate us!

180
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:47,958
[AKUMA E]
Pathetic worms!

181
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,708
You're only buying
time with your barrier.

182
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:52,583
It won't keep Levels
Twos out for long!

183

[ANITA grunts]

184
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,791

[AKUMA F]
Why you...

188
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,208
[AKUMA E]
You bastards!

189

We're gonna crush you!

[LAVI] If you want to crush
someone, take my advice.

197
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,750
Next time, do it like this!

00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,750
Thank you! You saved our lives!

200
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,500
Let's not congratulate
ourselves just yet.

[BOTH gasp]

202
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,958
[AKUMA H]
A ship crawling with Exorcists!

203
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:49,083
[AKUMA I]
And look! Humans, too!

204
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,708
On the bright side,

205
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,166
I can attack with my eye closed
and hit a target every time.

206
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,708
True. I didn't think
the dining on this ship

207
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,041
would be this generous.

208
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,916
Get ready!

209
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,333
[ALLEN gasps]

He thinks he's faster
than you! What a laugh!

211
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,875
How's that Exorcist?
Good luck catching me!

I'll make it.

That's good to hear.

[LAVI] Lenalee! You have
to rescue Allen!

00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,125
[BOOKMAN] You're the only one
who can catch up to the Akuma.

234
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,041
Use your Dark Boots
and bring him back.

235
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,958
[KRORY] There's more than enough
of us to protect the ship.

236

What about--

237
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,708
[ANITA]
Please go to him.

[LENALEE]
Anita...

239
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,583
Capable as he is,

240
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,458
it isn't safe for Allen
to be fighting alone.

241
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,041
He may be an Exorcist,

242
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,833
but taking on that many Akuma
without help will overwhelm him.

243
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,208
[LENALEE]
Uh.

244
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,166
Don't forget, we're Supporters
of the Black Order.

245
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,000
Everyone aboard will fight.
Leave these Akuma to us.

246
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,500
I understand.

247
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:35,666
[KRORY]
Hurry.

248
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,041

Got it.

[AKUMA A] What good is it going
to do you shooting other guys?

251
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,208
You know, if you really
want off this ride

252
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,125
you ought to do
something about me.

253
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,625
Then again, are you sure
you really want to?

254
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,583
I mean if you blast me
I'll drop you.

255
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,875
You'll plunge hundreds of feet
to your inevitable demise.

[AKUMA B grunts]
He stepped on my head!

258
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,000
The Exorcist stepped on me!

I won't let you get away!

[ALLEN groans]

262
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,791
Not even a scratch...

[yelps]

264
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,416
[AKUMA O] You sure we
should be doing this?

265
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,708
[AKUMA A]
Meaning what?

266
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,291
[AKUMA O] You know I love
capturing Exorcists,

267
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,250
but that's not the
job we were given.

268
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,583
If we don't hurry up with
the Millennium Earl's orders,

269
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:36,541
won't he pulverize us?

270
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:37,500
[ALLEN]
What job?

271
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,125
[AKUMA A]
Oh come on, relax.

272
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,708
You're just jealous 'cuz I
get to kill the Exorcist,

273
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:42,708
aren't you?

274
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:43,791
[AKUMA O]
Ha, ha! Yeah, kind of.

275
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,708
Give me the right
half of his body.

276
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,208
[AKUMA P] That's not fair!
Save me a piece or two!

277
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,083
[ALLEN]
What's this job they mentioned?

278
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,875
It's possible there's
Innocence located nearby.

279
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,541
But still, sending such a large
number of Akuma is unusual.

280
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:57,791
[ALLEN yelps]

281
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,708
[AKUMA A]
Did I break your concentration?

282
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,625
This is no time for daydreaming!

283
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,500
[ALLEN grunts]

284
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:05,666
[AKUMA A]
Hows this?

285
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,000
With your left
arm in my mouth,

286
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,541
it makes it difficult to
do much of anything, huh?

287
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,875
Ha, ha! I'm not gonna
drop you, little one.

288
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,791
You're mine to kill.

289
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,000

292
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,625
I demand you let
Allen Walker go!

293
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,250
[AKUMA A]
No chance girlie!

294
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,666
The only way you're
getting him back

295
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,458
is if you can take him from me!

296
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:28,958
[LENALEE]
Innocence, Level Two!

297
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:32,458
Release! Barden!

298
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:42,833
[AKUMA growling]

299
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:47,708
[LENALEE] Sounds are vibrations
that travel through the air.

300
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:51,125
The Sound Shackles turn those
vibrations into footholds,

301
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:55,041
allowing the wielder
to move at sonic speed!

302
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,833
[AKUMA A]
What the...?

303
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,208
[LENALEE]
Take this!

304
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,041
[ALLEN screams]

305
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,208
Allen grab my hand!

306
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,458

[LAVI yells]

313
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:06,708
[LAVI] This feeling...
Something's wrong.

314
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:09,750
[KRORY grunts]
I sense it as well.

315
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,375
It's on the other side
of those mountains.

316
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:16,291
And we're stuck here,
with the worst possible view.

317

318
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,333
[AKUMA R]
Forward!

319
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:26,416
[AKUMA S]
Bring it down!

320
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,125
[AKUMA growl]

Ahh! Sound Shackles!

322
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,750
Whoa. You're quick on your feet.

323
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,875
Sorry. Are you okay Allen?

324
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,416
Yeah. I'm all right.
But, more importantly...

325
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:42,958
[ALLEN gasps]

326
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:46,916
[roaring]

327
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,125
Why are they attacking it?

328
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,666
Their job. Is that
what they meant?

329
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,291
Their goal was to
destroy this thing?

330
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:01,291
[roaring]

331
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:04,875
[gasps] His face...

332
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:20,083
It's Suman.

333
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:27,625
Once again... A Fallen One.

334
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,541
[LENALEE screams]

335
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:40,125
What? Why did you scream?
Are you hurt?

336
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,458
He's a Fallen one.

337
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,166
[gasps]

338
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,833
[LENALEE] Someone who failed
to become an apostle.

339
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,250
[ALLEN]
Suman Dark.

340
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,291
An Apostle of God who failed.

341
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:42,291
After being taken inside of him
I learn the shocking truth.

342
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,458
On the next <i>D. Gray-Man</i> :

343
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:49,500
"Fallen One." Bring salvation
to this poor Akuma's soul.

344
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:56,208
Starting today we have a new
on-going segment that, uh...
