1
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:46,166
What a beautiful day!

2
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,333
Perfect for a swim.

3
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:50,416
You wanna join me?

4
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,458
We don't have time
to go swimming...

5
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:53,916
There are reports
of large swarms

6
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,375
of Akuma heading
towards Barcelona.

7
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:57,375
Yeah, I know...

8
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,166
But a boy can dream can't he...

9
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,333
With all due respect,

10
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:01,666
we don't have time
to waste if we're going

11
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,333
to find General Tiedoll
before the Akuma...

12
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,375
Weren't you both trained by him?

13
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:07,166
That's right.

14
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,458
More or less.

15
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,125
Kanda and I both
did a lot of training

16
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:13,208
with Tiedoll when he was
on assignment for the Order.

17
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:14,958
Isn't that right?

18
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:18,416
I've only heard rumors;
what's the general like?

19
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,041
Sorry. Never mind.

20
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,000
Move over...

21
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:21,666
Okay...

22
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,041
You're in the way.

23
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,791
I've never seen so many.

24
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:33,208
They're coming from all sides.

25
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,083
Just the way I like 'em!

26
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:38,250
Mugen... Unsheathe!

27
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,708
That reminds me!

28
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:45,458
Today is exactly the same as
the day I met General Tiedoll!

29
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,500
Innocence...! Activate!

30
00:02:58,583 --> 00:02:59,750
Daisya!

31
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:00,625
Man!

32
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:01,875
We've talked about this...

33
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,125
If you're not in school,

34
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:04,750
I could really use your
help around the shop.

35
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,375
Mom...! I keep telling you...!

36
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't wanna work
in a souvenir shop!

37
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,041
Watch your tone!

38
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,333
No... I don't care
what you say...!

39
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,541
I'm not gonna waste my
life selling boring junk

40
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,583
to boring tourists!

41
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,666
Come back here!

42
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,375
Daisya, no!

43
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,250
Why, you--!

44
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,000
What a perfect little town.

45
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,791
Goal!

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,041
Yes...! Hurry up and
throw the ball back!

47
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,125
Come on, man...

48
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,791
Quit hogging the ball
and let us play.

49
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,416
He's right! This isn't fun!

50
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,583
Aw, you're all just jealous

51
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,083
'cause I'm gonna
leave this stupid town

52
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,583
to be a professional
soccer player!

53
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,166
If you guys aren't
real nice to me now,

54
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,750
you may end up
regretting it someday.

55
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,291
Let's go swimming!

56
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,125
What the?

57
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,541
Last one in's a rotten egg!

58
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,208
Hey!

59
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,041
Geronimo!

60
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:41,416
The sky is ridiculously blue.

61
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,166
So's the ocean.

62
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,166
And, voila!

63
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,166
There...!
That's what I call art!

64
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,333
Hey...

65
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,125
I fixed your crappy
painting for you...

66
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,750
Now it doesn't look
so much like a picture

67
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,125
on some dumb tourist's postcard.

68
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:43,333
What? You got a problem?

69
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:44,625
Do you live here?

70
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,416
You do, don't you?

71
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,041
What's your name?

72
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,000
Hey, come back here!

73
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,500
Why don't you try and catch me?

74
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:01,958
What?

75
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,791
Man!

76
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,000
Go away!

77
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,291
Watch it, old man!

78
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,750
What's wrong with you?

79
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,541
I've got lot better things

80
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:45,250
to do than play soccer
with some old man.

81
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,208
Hold on a second.

82
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:50,291
Why don't you and I go
and get something to eat?

83
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,541
Good, isn't it?

84
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,500
I guess it's okay...

85
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:04,541
For a stupid tourist place.

86
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,375
You... have a family?

87
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,916
Yeah, I've got
plenty of family...

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,333
A nagging mom,
a big jerk for a dad,

89
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:14,166
two annoying little brothers
and a crybaby sister.

90
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,541
Is that so?

91
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:16,791
You know it sounds to me like

92
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:20,041
you're getting tired of
your life in this town.

93
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,333
Maybe, what of it?

94
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:24,750
Given any thought to
becoming an Exorcist?

95
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,875
Me, an Exorcist?

96
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,000
Aren't Exorcists the ones

97
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,958
that hunt down all the demons?

98
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,083
Right...

99
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,000
It would be your
job to fight Akuma...

100
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,708
And you could start
training immediately.

101
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,250
You got to be kidding...

102
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,500
What do you really do, sell
kids into slavery or something?

103
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,833
Try thinking of me
more as a talent scout.

104
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:52,333
Not everyone has the ability
to fight Akuma, but you do.

105
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,541
Exorcists are members
of an organization

106
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,125
known as the Black Order...

107
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,375
And each one has a unique
weapon for fighting Akuma...

108
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,750
You have one also...

109
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:04,333
Which makes you a very
special person indeed...

110
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,916
You're what's referred to
as an "Accommodator," Daisya.

111
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,375
The Innocence I carry reacted

112
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,333
as soon as it sensed
your presence...

113
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:15,291
Your weapon will be
forged using this Innocence,

114
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:19,500
and with it you'll travel
the world destroying Akuma.

115
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,125
If I knew you
were such a lunatic,

116
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,625
I never would have let you
feed me such crappy food!

117
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,833
There you are...!
What are you doing here?

118
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,125
Hurry up and run home.

119
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,500
Your mother needs
you around the shop.

120
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,333
Wait!

121
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:42,041
Don't you run away from me!

122
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,666
Hey! Mom, Derry ate mine!

123
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,375
Did not!

124
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,166
Settle down...

125
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,833
Share with your brother.

126
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:07,583
Daisya...

127
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:08,833
When you're done eating,

128
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,833
do me a favor and take
the kids to their room.

129
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,166
Huh...? Yeah, okay.

130
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,375
Come on, guys. Why don't
you leave each other alone...?

131
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,375
And Darna, quit crying, okay?

132
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,583
But Derry started it,
he took my--

133
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,666
I don't care who started it!

134
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,166
With a weapon forged
from Innocence

135
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,041
you'll travel the
world destroying Akuma.

136
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,666
Cannonball!

137
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,208
Hey!

138
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,583
Did you guys hear the news?

139
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,958
A bunch of monsters just
appeared at the harbor!

140
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,000
What?!

141
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,000
What the heck are those things?

142
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,708
Step aside young ones...

143
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,291
Hey, old man!

144
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,500
Try to stay out of the way.

145
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,916
Oh, Maker of Eden...

146
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,250
Activate!

147
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,416
And acknowledge the
beauty that's in the world.

148
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,458
Art!

149
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,875
Holy crap!

150
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:14,708
He killed all those
monsters like it was nothing!

151
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,583
So that is an Akuma...

152
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:20,083
The demons that
you'll hunt and kill.

153
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,125
The world is overwhelmed
with these creatures...

154
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:25,500
And only we Exorcists
can stop them...

155
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,458
I'll wait for you
at the edge of town.

156
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,875
I'm not going anywhere
with you, old man!

157
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:39,875
Where are you going?

158
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,416
Come on... man...

159
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,083
So those were Akuma.

160
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:59,291
How can an old man like that
kill those monsters so easily?

161
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,125
And can I really
fight them, too?

162
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,333
Stop that!

163
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:25,583
Those are for the customers!

164
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,166
Oh, Daisya! Where have you been?

165
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,291
Out.

166
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,333
People have been saying...

167
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,083
There were monsters
in the bay...

168
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,958
But you weren't
down there, were you?

169
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,125
Monsters aren't real;

170
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,583
they were probably
just a couple of sharks.

171
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,833
They were not...!
They were Akuma!

172
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,750
What?

173
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,375
Hey! Gimme yours!

174
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,625
No! Eat your own food!

175
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:55,541
Shut up!

176
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:56,583
Give it back to me!

177
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:57,583
No way!

178
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,833
Give it back!

179
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:04,666
It's mine, I said!

180
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,166
Not at the table.

181
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,208
Daisya?

182
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,916
Daisya!

183
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:31,375
What's with him?

184
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,958
Hey.

185
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,041
I'll go to my room now.

186
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,458
What are you always
trying to see out there?

187
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:48,833
Huh?

188
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,541
I know that I can't
expect you to be excited

189
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,583
about selling souvenirs
in a quiet little town...

190
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:58,125
But this is what we have
to do in order to survive.

191
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,208
Whatever it is you're
trying to find...

192
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,166
You just aren't
going to find it here.

193
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,666
I'm sorry, son.

194
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,916
Dad... Look...

195
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,666
Time for bed.

196
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:52,083
Dad. I'm sorry.

197
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,333
Where did you wander
off to this time...?

198
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,875
You know the morning is
our busiest time of day!

199
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,333
The least you could do
is lend me a hand

200
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,291
until the rush dies down.

201
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,125
Mom.

202
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,083
I'm going away.

203
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,583
What on earth are
you talking about?

204
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,916
Sorry... I've made up my mind.

205
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,916
Daisya...? You're not
really leaving, are you?

206
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,166
If you stay we promise
not to fight anymore!

207
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,791
Brother!

208
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:35,375
But you can't just leave...!
Who'll look after you?

209
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,958
Nobody...

210
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,333
I'm... working.

211
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,750
Why don't you look for
a job closer to home?

212
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,791
Because the job I want to
do doesn't exist in this town.

213
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:45,708
Daisya!

214
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,291
I'm real sorry, Mom...

215
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,833
I already made up my mind to go
and that's all there is to it.

216
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,750
Daisya!

217
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,750
We should let him go.

218
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,625
We both knew this
day would come...

219
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,791
It's just a couple
of years earlier

220
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:03,208
than we expected, that's all.

221
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,666
Try to take care of
yourselves, okay?

222
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,833
So, are you ready to go?

223
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,291
What's that?

224
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:06,166
Are you blind or somethin'...?
It's a doorbell.

225
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,625
Something from home...?

226
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:09,708
Yeah...

227
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,125
Guess it is...

228
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,125
It kinda reminds me
of my nagging mom...

229
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,458
My big jerk of a dad,

230
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:17,583
two annoying little brothers
and crybaby sister.

231
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:18,833
In that whole house,

232
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,333
this bell is the only
thing I really liked.

233
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:25,333
Well?

234
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:26,958
Let's get going!

235
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,791
Shoot!

236
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,166
You can run,
but you can't hide...

237
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,916
My bell will find you!

238
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,083
Shoot!

239
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,791
Ta-da!

240
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,291
Are you guys all right?

241
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,333
I'd say this is pretty
conclusive proof

242
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,666
that more Akuma are
heading to Barcelona.

243
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,041
True.

244
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,583
Man...

245
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,916
The Order is sending us all
into certain death once again...

246
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,333
But I guess that's
the life of an Exorcist.

247
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,708
Yet you act like you're
having the time of your life.

248
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,625
Hey, as long as
I don't get bored

249
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,416
I'm a relatively happy man...

250
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,833
And ever since
I became an Exorcist,

251
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,208
bored is one thing
I've never been.

252
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:48,208
In fact, I haven't
felt anything but alive.

253
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,375
And if we're lucky,
the General will too...

254
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,750
He's a nasty old man,

255
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,375
but if it wasn't
for him I wouldn't be

256
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:57,000
the practically-perfect
person I am today.

257
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,416
Let's move.

258
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,041
After analyzing the recent
data from our Finders,

259
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,166
we've narrowed down Tiedoll's
potential hiding places

260
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,541
to a single region...

261
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,916
It's now our belief
that he's in Barcelona.

262
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:24,166
What would General Tiedoll
be doing in Barcelona?

263
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,166
Looks like the Akuma
are targeting the General!

264
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,208
Does anyone know
how to contact Marie?

265
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,875
Alert every Exorcist and Finder
stationed anywhere near Spain...

266
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,208
They're to drop what they're
doing and get to Barcelona.

267
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:40,833
Yes, sir!

268
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,500
Right!

269
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,625
Reever. What's the
latest reports?

270
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,125
We've gone through
all the Innocence

271
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,250
we have at the Order...

272
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,583
Testing has led us nowhere...

273
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:54,708
While we still haven't been able

274
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,166
to find anything
out of the ordinary,

275
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,125
that doesn't mean we don't
have the Heart of Innocence

276
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,875
somewhere in our possession.

277
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:03,125
Hevlaska says she can't
tell the difference, either.

278
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,208
So...

279
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,500
It's possible that
General Tiedoll's

280
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,708
Innocence is the Heart.

281
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:40,291
The city of
Barcelona is infested

282
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:43,291
by a swarm of deadly Akuma.

283
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:47,000
A battle of unprecedented
scale is about to begin.

284
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:52,500
On the next episode of
D. Gray-man: "Froi Tiedoll."

285
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:56,333
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul!
