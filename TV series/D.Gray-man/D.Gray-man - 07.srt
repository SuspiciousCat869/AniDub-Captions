1
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,125
Begone, Akuma!

2
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,333
John...

3
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:55,791
I know you mean well
but you've got to stop this.

4
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:59,125
Leo's been dead for some time...

5
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:02,625
He died on the day of
his mommy's funeral.

6
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:04,083
Leo, no...

7
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:07,791
Allen?!

8
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,458
With the Earl's power,

9
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:12,375
Leo was able to bring his
mother's soul back

10
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,166
from death to this world...

11
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,375
and she was turned...
into an Akuma.

12
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,166
Ahhh, I remember you now...!

13
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,583
Yes, indeed-d, I met you a
long time ago, didn't I...?

14
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,750
Your name is Allen
Walker, isn't it...?

15
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,791
Aren't you the little
brat who wanted me

16
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:42,000
to bring his dead
daddy back to life?

17
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,875
Did Allen turn his own
father into an Akuma?!

18
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:52,833
Allen's father...

19
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,625
He made him... an Akuma?

20
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,708
No. Mana wasn't my
real father, John.

21
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,541
I had been abandoned...

22
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,458
for being born with
this strange arm...

23
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:08,625
and Mana, he was the
one who took me in...

24
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:12,875
He wasn't afraid of my arm
and he helped raise me.

25
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,791
Never stop...

26
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,250
Keep walking.

27
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,541
You see...

28
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,750
Mana was the only one
who taught me about living...

29
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,541
What you need to have to live...

30
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:39,208
and how to take care
of myself in the world.

31
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:46,916
But...

32
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,875
when he disappeared and
I was suddenly all by myself...

33
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,250
I didn't know...

34
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:54,333
I couldn't remember how
to take care of me anymore.

35
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,458
I never really
believed that Mana...

36
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,750
that Father could die...

37
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,750
Mana... come on...

38
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,708
Wake up, Mana!

39
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,083
Mana!

40
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,791
Allen... listen to me...

41
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,291
No matter what happens...

42
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,458
No matter what...

43
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:21,458
Never stop...

44
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:22,500
Don't talk like that...

45
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,125
Please, Mana, get up!

46
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,208
Never stop...

47
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,250
Always keep walking...

48
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,500
I need you.
Don't leave me alone!

49
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,625
Always keep walking, Allen!

50
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:41,666
Until the day... you die...

51
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:44,625
No...

52
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:45,916
Mana...

53
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,125
Wake up...

54
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,791
Please don't go...

55
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,916
Don't die and leave me...

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,291
Mana!

57
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:13,291
Good evening,
little one. You look sad...

58
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,458
Huh?

59
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:24,541
Would you like me to bring your
daddy back to life for you?

60
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,625
What?

61
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,083
I simply need
you to call for him,

62
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,416
since you have such
a special bond...

63
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,208
Wouldn't it be great if
you could see him again?

64
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,500
He'll come back?

65
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:36,916
Of course...

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,958
Come, let's call him back
from your detestable God.

67
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,250
But can he...

68
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,666
I mean, will he...
hear me calling?

69
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,458
Now... raise your voice
and call the soul

70
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:03,416
of the one you love
back from the other world.

71
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:09,416
That's it...
Don't be scared now...

72
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:17,833
Mana!!

73
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,250
Mana!

74
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:34,708
Al... Allen.

75
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,708
Mana!

76
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,750
How could you...?

77
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,625
How dare you make me an Akuma!

78
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,750
I curse you... Allen!

79
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,791
How could you make me an Akuma?!

80
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:03,625
Oh, young Allen,
you're all mine now...

81
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:08,333
Mana Walker, I order you to
kill the boy and wear his body!

82
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:14,416
I curse you... Allen!

83
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,541
I didn't know what
had happened...

84
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,333
My left arm
somehow activated...

85
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,041
and moved on it's own...

86
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,666
it attacked the Akuma
holding Mana's soul.

87
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,666
Stop... Don't hurt Mana!

88
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,208
Run, Father...

89
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,666
Father... no!

90
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,833
Allen...

91
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,250
I love you.

92
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,416
Destroy Me...

93
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,083
Please...

94
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,125
Destroy me...

95
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,833
Allen.

96
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:15,000
Mana!!!

97
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:24,375
Then Master came...
and explained it to me...

98
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,250
Everything that
happened that day.

99
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,750
Everything...

100
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,041
What made up an Akuma,

101
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:32,000
all about the evil
Millennium Earl, and even...

102
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,708
what had happened to me.

103
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,791
Does he mean General Cross...?

104
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,458
But how did he...

105
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,916
The souls trapped inside
Akuma are powerless...

106
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,416
They're forever captive...

107
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,000
and become dangerous
toys of the Millennium Earl.

108
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,833
Destroying them is the
only way to save them.

109
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,250
A human born with an
Anti-Akuma Weapon...

110
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,958
What an unfortunate fate.

111
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:11,000
You also appear to be an
apostle possessed by God.

112
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:17,208
How would you like to
be... an Exorcist?

113
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,125
Ever since that time...

114
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,458
I've been able to see the souls

115
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:24,541
trapped inside
The Earl's Akumas.

116
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:25,791
At first...

117
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,625
I thought Mana was
cursing me out of anger...

118
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,666
so I tried to be an
Exorcist to atone

119
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,708
for what I'd done to him...

120
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:38,041
but as I began to encounter many
Akuma, I realized something...

121
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,375
They don't shed tears
out of hatred...

122
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,416
but of deepest love
they feel toward those

123
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,625
who turned them into Akuma.

124
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,833
They weep knowing that we
could never bear the pain.

125
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,750
I discovered that my fate
was to be an Exorcist...

126
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:56,750
not to atone for sin, but to
live true to my calling here.

127
00:09:56,833 --> 00:10:00,708
And this cursed Weapon...
has been a faithful guide.

128
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,583
Akuma are tragic creatures...

129
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,791
They shouldn't have to
suffer in this existence.

130
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,166
And therefore...

131
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,750
I destroy them.

132
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,416
Allen Walker...

133
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,750
I should have
killed you long ago.

134
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,583
You can see the
souls inside Akuma...?

135
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:31,041
You want to save 'em...?
Go ahead, Exorcist...

136
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,958
I want to see you try.

137
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,958
Take your best shot,
but let me go first!

138
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,583
No!

139
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:43,250
Allen, lookout!

140
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,291
Don't worry about me...

141
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:49,375
I took the bullets earlier...
because I had to protect John...

142
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:53,875
but with this level of attack...
they can't kill me.

143
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,625
Allen...

144
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,458
The virus didn't work,

145
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,750
so you think you can
just shoot me to death...?

146
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,375
Don't underestimate me.

147
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,416
You see, whenever
the Anti-Akuma Weapon

148
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,958
is activated within me...

149
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:14,000
it exhibits superhuman strength
and incredible speed...

150
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,000
The Akuma's bullets
and hard exteriors

151
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,041
are no match for this arm.

152
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,875
It is God's weapon...

153
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:23,250
and it exists for the sole
purpose of destroying yours.

154
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,166
What conceit...

155
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,625
Well, then...

156
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:31,458
Lero, lero, lero!

157
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:42,166
Tell me, do you know the
old Eastern proverb...?

158
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,708
He who fires in the
end shall hit the mark.

159
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:54,291
And with bullets like these...
How can I miss?!

160
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,458
Now...

161
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,000
Akuma cannons... fire!

162
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,750
Allen...!

163
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,375
Allen!!

164
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:07,041
And you... you will die!

165
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,000
Innocence... activate!

166
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Lenalee?!

167
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,333
Watch out for him!

168
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,250
That's amazing...

169
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,833
Lenalee is an Exorcist!

170
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,083
I had no idea...

171
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,458
She has an
Anti-Akuma Weapon, too?

172
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:46,625
Yes...

173
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,083
Hers fly in the sky
like butterflies...

174
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:53,000
and yet come down as powerful
and destructive as steel.

175
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,958
Lenalee's Anti-Akuma
weapon is known as...

176
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,750
the Dark Boots.

177
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,166
Incredible!

178
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:03,041
Ah, so another insect has
appeared in the sky...

179
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,083
This ought to be fun.

180
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:09,083
In no time at all you'll
be dead as well, girl!

181
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,041
Just look at them, hopping
all over the place...

182
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,750
Make them disappear!

183
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,791
No, Lenalee!

184
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,541
Are you alright?!

185
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:52,583
Uh-huh... yeah, I'm okay.

186
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,250
Perfect. You can die together!

187
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,500
The Akuma must be
destroyed soon...

188
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,416
or this entire town
will be at great risk!

189
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,750
Destroyed...

190
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:18,708
Akuma are evil, malicious
weapons created by the Earl...

191
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,958
the Enemy of mankind...

192
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,958
They have to be destroyed...

193
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:26,166
I thought... I knew
what we were doing...

194
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,708
Listen to this, Leo...!

195
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,583
It says that Akuma wear the
skin of the humans they kill!

196
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,083
But if that's true
then how could we tell

197
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,291
if someone was an Akuma or not?

198
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:46,458
I was the one who
told Leo about Akuma...

199
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:49,583
and I made him go
on patrol with me...

200
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:53,375
Leo, you knew the
Millennium Earl was evil...

201
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,333
You knew it...!

202
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,666
So how...

203
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,708
how could you...

204
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,375
Were you so shocked by your
mother's death that you forgot?

205
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,666
Was the pain too hard for you?

206
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,875
Mother!

207
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,250
Stupid...

208
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,250
You're so stupid...

209
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:44,708
Did you miss her so much that
you had to do this to her...?!

210
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,458
Use him to make
her into an Akuma?!

211
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,083
I don't have Allen's eye...

212
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:57,125
and I can't see
an Akuma's soul...

213
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:01,791
I don't know if Leo's mother is
really crying in there or not!

214
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,750
I can't see...

215
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:10,125
...but it's awful!

216
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,500
I'm sorry... Leo.

217
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,583
The Akuma are so strong...

218
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,958
All of them have
to be destroyed...

219
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:21,000
I thought they were just
fun things to talk about.

220
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,250
I never thought about
what they really are--

221
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,833
that they're real people
who are suffering.

222
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,041
The people whose souls

223
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:32,125
are made into Akuma
are never free again.

224
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:39,125
They... They all become...
the Millennium Earl's toys...

225
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,708
forever.

226
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,916
Akuma are tragic creatures...

227
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,666
They shouldn't have to
suffer in this existence.

228
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,000
And therefore...

229
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,125
I destroy them.

230
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,750
Allen, destroy him...!

231
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,875
Destroy Leo!

232
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:03,625
Please... release him
from his suffering!

233
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,708
With this one blow...

234
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,083
I'll send them all to the grave.

235
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,791
I will be your salvation...

236
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:25,875
Cross...

237
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,375
Grave!

238
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,833
This is not good, lero...!

239
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:41,125
Level one Akuma are no
match for this one, lero!

240
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,708
We will take our
leave for now...

241
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,708
but make no mistake,
I'll be back!

242
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,041
Earl!!

243
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,500
Oh yes, these exciting exercises

244
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,375
have merely been
a prelude, my boy...

245
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:57,041
Akuma are continuing to
evolve all over the globe...

246
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,750
and the groundwork
is being laid'

247
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,333
for an end of the
world spectacular.

248
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,375
Behold...

249
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,291
I am the Millennium Earl...

250
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,166
the Maker of Akuma...

251
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,000
the one who will defeat your
disgraced and powerless God...

252
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:13,333
and destroy this pathetic
world with my weapons.

253
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,708
No matter how hard you
Exorcists strive and struggle...

254
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,291
you will never be able
to save yourselves...

255
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,125
Never!

256
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:28,083
We'll see... next time...

257
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,125
Allen!

258
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:34,833
You okay?

259
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,916
I'm alright...

260
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,083
I think...

261
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,166
I'm just a little
bit tired, that's all.

262
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,541
John?

263
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,708
I just...

264
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,250
I'm sorry...

265
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,958
I'm sorry, Allen...

266
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,333
Lenalee, where were you??!

267
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:12,500
Oh, how you could you stay out
all night without telling me?

268
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:14,583
John sent it?

269
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,458
Well, yes... but listen,

270
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,083
you should probably be
careful when you open it.

271
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,500
I missed you so very much...

272
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,791
That's one stinky bomb...

273
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,166
If this onion toy
is the best he can do

274
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,916
then he's still got
a long way to go.

275
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,208
Funny, that's
what John said, too.

276
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,708
I want to go work
with my dad someday...

277
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,125
I'll study more
and improve myself...

278
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:50,083
since it seems like there's so
much I don't understand yet...

279
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,916
So please tell him
to wait for me

280
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,333
until I get there, okay, Allen?

281
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,208
Alright...

282
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,291
Well, let's both do our best.

283
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,000
Is he crying?!

284
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,750
Sure looks like it.

285
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,375
Well, there's something
you don't see every day.

286
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,166
Quiet...!

287
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,625
I got onion in my eye...

288
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,708
it hurts!

289
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,208
You've still got a lot to
learn as well... don't you?

290
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,250
Eh?

291
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,875
I wasn't aware that
The Order began

292
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:25,916
allowing Exorcists to act
on their own like that...

293
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,541
But still...

294
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:32,833
my son was saved
thanks to you, Walker.

295
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,083
What do you say...

296
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,625
let's try to finish this
portion off quickly...

297
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,541
I think I need to take
a few days' vacation...

298
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,291
to go visit my son.

299
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,125
That's a great idea!

300
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,583
Well, it doesn't
seem terribly fair

301
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,291
that you're the only one
to get a good scolding...

302
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,208
I've got a little bit
left for him as well.

303
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,416
Never stop...

304
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,416
Keep walking...

305
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,208
Mana.

306
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:39,833
Every exorcist and scientist

307
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:43,458
at the Black Order is exhausted
from working day and night...

308
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:46,375
And Komui puts more
pressure on us all.

309
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,333
On the next episode
of D. Gray-man:

310
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,750
"The Black Order
Annihilation Incident"?!

311
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:56,000
Bring forth salvation to this
tormented Akuma's soul!
