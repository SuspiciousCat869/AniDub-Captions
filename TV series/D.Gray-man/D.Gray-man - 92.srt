2
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,458
Huh. What do we have here?

3
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:55,875
Where are my manners?
I haven't greeted ya yet.

4
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:58,875
Good evening, my friends.

5
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:02,041
Well, now. You haven't
changed a bit.

6
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:04,750
Have you, you fat bastard?

7
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:09,000
How long have you been in here?

8
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:12,041
I don't recall seeing you.

9
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,666
Or perhaps you've been hiding

10
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,541
right under our noses this
entire time, is that it?

11
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,916
I'm aware that
your lady companion

12
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,166
has the ability to
conceal your presence.

13
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,833
That was very clever
of you, albeit cowardly.

14
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,333
[chuckles]

15
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,583
[ROAD]
Hm?

16
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:36,666
[ROAD] So, Tycki. Did you
change your cigarette brand?

17
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,458
[MILLENNIUM EARL] You're also
using it to run from your debts,

18
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:44,708
aren't you?

19
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,000
[chuckles]

20
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:49,708
Look, I didn't come here

21
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,375
to listen to your
blathering, old man.

22
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,583
So fight me or get lost.

23
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,916
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
"Get lost"? Ha-ha!

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,208
Last time I checked, Noah's
Ark was my own property.

25
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:02,083
[chuckles]

26
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,875
Till you jumped ship.

27
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,666
It might as well be a
duck that lost its wings

28
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,791
to fly out of Edo.

29
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,125
Since it was cursed...

30
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,208
...by the traitor to the Noahs,

31
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:20,875
the one they call
"The Fourteenth."

32
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:24,041
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
So I was right about you.

33
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,833
You really are the person

34
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:30,375
the Fourteenth selected to
be known as "The Player."

35
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,875
"The Player"?

36
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,250
What's he mean?

37
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,750
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
In any case,

38
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:44,125
I'm sorry to say you've
arrived too late.

39
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,666
The heart of this Ark has
already been transferred

40
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,166
into the new one.

41
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,625
Without the heart,

42
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,125
it's impossible to
operate this vessel.

43
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:55,083
Player or not, you're
helpless to change fate.

44
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,750
You've made a grave
error, Cross.

45
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:02,666
And now, you'll never be able
to leave this place again.

46
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,583
[laughs]

47
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,208
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
When this is all over...

48
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,708
[MILLENNIUM EARL] ...Noah's
Ark will become a coffin

49
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:16,375
that sucks the life out of
these pitiful Exorcists.

50
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:20,500
[laughing]

51
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,750
No, don't!
You're still bleeding!

52
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,833
It's over!

53
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,708
Allen, no!

54
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,333
Isn't that my sword?

55
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:59,875
Ooh. Just look
at that animosity!

56
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,958
[laughs]

57
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,041
[yells]

58
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,375
Be careful!

59
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:22,458
[singing]

60
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,958
[ALLEN]
Something's controlling me!

61
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:36,291
It's Carte Garde.
Maria stopped me!

62
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,875
[CROSS]
Cut it out!

63
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:41,208
You can't afford to lose your
head, you foolish apprentice!

64
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:44,791
Tell Maria to let go
of me, right now!

65
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:49,333
Don't fight the Earl
just out of hate.

66
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,583
Don't go, Lero!

67
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,625
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
Thank you for your service.

68
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:56,916
So sorry you had to play along
with these errant children.

69
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,708
[LERO]
It was a nightmare, Lero!

70
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,125
[laughs]

71
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:05,041
But as a result, my dear
Tyki has finally awakened.

72
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,541
The boy had a nasty habit

73
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:10,208
of subconsciously suppressing
the Noah inside him.

74
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,666
He carries the
"pleasure" memory.

75
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,750
I have a soft spot for that.

76
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,583
[LERO] Let's settle into
our new home, Lero!

77
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:26,000
[MILLENNIUM EARL] Indeed!
Farewell then, Exorcists!

78
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:37,458
[CROSS] This place won't
last much longer.

79
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:41,791
[CROSS] You two. I assume
you know my mission?

80
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,750
Destroying the Akuma
plant, right?

81
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,458
[CROSS]
We're not far from it now.

82
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,208
Are you saying it's
inside Noah's Ark?

83
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,666
[CROSS]
Get up, Allen.

84
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,458
I rescued you from that Noah...

85
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:00,041
...because there's something
that I need you to do for me.

86
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,208
North Crime should do it!

87
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,500
Only a few left now.

88
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:24,291
[music playing]

89
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,666
There's a new sound in the sky!

90
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,541
New sound?

91
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,916
But what?

92
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,833
Look there.

93
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,208
[MIRANDA]
What's that up in the sky?

94
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,000
[MILLENNIUM EARL] Just one
more step to completion.

95
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,916
So there's another Ark!

96
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,333
[MIRANDA]
Where's that one going?

97
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,208
It's taking to the sky.

98
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,625
But, Bookman,

99
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,500
that's the one that's carrying
Kanda and the others.

100
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:52,875
But if they're trapped in there,
what will become of them?

101
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:02,916
Take us to the plant,
would you, Tim?

102
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,416
[ALLEN]
Tim?

103
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,666
[ALLEN]
Where are we?

104
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,333
[CROSS]
Turn around.

105
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,166
[LENALEE, ALLEN gasp]

106
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,333
[CROSS] That's the egg for
magic bodies. The plant.

107
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,791
[LENALEE]
Really?

108
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,791
I wanted to dispose of
it as soon as possible,

109
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,125
but that's a tall order.

110
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,625
[LENALEE]
A barrier.

111
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,833
We don't have enough
time to dismantle it.

112
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,291
Besides, the egg's
being downloaded

113
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,416
to the new Ark as we speak.

114
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,375
Then, as soon as it's
finished transferring,

115
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:45,958
the old Ark will disappear,
and we'll go with it.

116
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,208
[ALLEN, LENALEE gasp]

117
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:50,416
Which is why I'm asking
you to help me, Allen.

118
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,833
[ALLEN]
Me?

119
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:55,333
That's right. You will
operate the Ark.

120
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:56,416
[ALLEN]
Huh?

121
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,291
[CROSS]
That should cancel the download

122
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,375
and prevent the Ark
from vanishing.

123
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,125
What? I don't understand!

124
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,666
[CROSS] Stop whining
and do as I tell you!

125

Hey, wait a sec!

126
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,541
I wanna fix this, but I
don't know the first thing

127
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:09,875
about steering this ship!

128
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,625

This isn't optional.

00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:21,083
Damn. It's already underway.

That spell ought to
delay the downloading.

In the meantime,
prepare to steer.

136

But you still haven't
told me how to do that.

Uh, what heart?

Only hope? The heart?

Wait, didn't the Earl say

You've arrived too late.

The heart of this

00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,208
[ALLEN]
You're--

163
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:22,458
That's my key. See it?

164
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,166
Your key?

165
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,166
Timcanpy?

166
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,916
[SHADOW]
Yes, my Timcanpy.

167
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,250
Timcanpy belongs to my
Master. He isn't yours.

168
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,708
[SHADOW]
Timcanpy. Allen.

169
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:46,041
Together, you are the Player.

170
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,000
"Player"?

171
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,250
[gasps]

172
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:52,166
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
So I was right about you.

173
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,333
You really are the person
the Fourteenth selected

174
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:58,166
to be known as "The Player."

175
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,833
That's right.

176
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:03,000
I heard the Earl
talking about that too.

177
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:15,166
[ALLEN]
What's the Player? Who are you?

178
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,791
You're the Fourteenth,
aren't you?

179
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,666
Why'd you choose me?

180
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,250
[gasps]

181
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:47,958
[ALLEN] Where's this uneasy
feeling coming from?

182
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,666
[CROSS]
You stupid kid!

183
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,500
[ALLEN] M-Master,
you're hurting my ears.

184
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,083
[CROSS] Quit dawdling
and stop that download!

185
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,166
[LENALEE]
The General has a radio too?

186
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,583
You're in, aren't you?

187
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:01,458
Can you hear my voice?
Answer me!

188
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,416
Lenalee! Yeah,
I hear you just fine.

189
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,958
I'm confused though.
What is this place?

190
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,625
[CROSS] No time!
Is there a piano in there?

191
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:11,791
[ALLEN]
What?

192
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:16,083
[CROSS]
A piano! Do you see one?

193
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,125
Yeah, it's right here.

194
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:21,500
[CROSS] Good. Then I
need you to play it.

195
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,541
That's the heart. It's
what controls the Ark!

196
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:25,625
[ALLEN]
Huh?

197
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,125
That's the heart?

198
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,875
[CROSS] The Earl doesn't know
about the room you're in,

199
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,291
which means he has no idea

200
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,000
there's another
heart to the ship.

201
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:35,833
We've got the advantage.
Get the song from Tim.

202
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,708
Master, I know you're
depending on me here,

203
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,708
but I've never played
a piano in my entire life.

204
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,000
I can't even read sheet music.

205
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,250
There's no way I
can steer the Ark!

206
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,500
[CROSS]
You can and you will, boy!

207
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,416
You're the one with the title.

208
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,625
[ALLEN]
Title? But I don't even--

209
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:53,916
[LENALEE]
Allen?

210
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,125
[ALLEN]
Yeah?

211
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,916
I can't say I
understand all of this,

212
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,250
but if the General believes
you can make it happen,

213
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,625
then I know that it's possible!

214
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:08,250
You have the power to
turn this around, Allen!

215
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,875
We came all the way to Edo

216
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,666
so we could help the General
carry out his mission.

217
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,291
If we give up now, everyone
who helped us get this far

218
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,958
will have been lost for nothing!

219
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,708
[CROSS]
You can play that song.

220
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:28,458
In fact, you're the
only one who can!

221
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:31,958
Understand? If you
play it right now--

222
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,208
[ALLEN]
Master!

223
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,000
[CROSS] ...not only will
you stop the download,

224
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:39,166
you'll control the Ark at will!

225
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,958
No, wait! Master!

226
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,625
It's up to me.

227
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,041
This is crazy.

228
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,125
But I... I don't have a choice.

229
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,708
[SHADOW]
You can play it.

230
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,250
[gasps]

231
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:11,250
After all, it's your melody.

232
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,166
Is that... the score?

233
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,708
[ALLEN]
It is.

234
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,375
And now for the finale!

235
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,875
The noises... they're fading.

236
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,291
Please, Time Record,
I'm begging you!

237
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,666
Stop time for Noah's Ark, now!

238
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:59,458
Isn't my power enough?
What more do I need to do?

239
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:03,583
Just save my comrades. Please!

240
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,500
Kanda's gone.

241
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:21,250
So we didn't only lose
Daisha, but him as well.

242
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,958
Lavi.

243
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:26,083
If only I had tried harder...

244
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:31,791
[MILLENNIUM EARL laughing]

245
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:37,333
[MILLENNIUM EARL] Yes, cry,
cry! It's all gone forever.

246
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,500
[chuckles]

247
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:41,208
[ROAD] You sound happy,
Lord Millennium.

248
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,166
[LERO]
Lero.

249
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,625
[MILLENNIUM EARL laughs]

250
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,208
[LULU BELL]
Well, are you pleased, Master?

251
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,041
[ROAD]
Seems like it.

252
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,958
[MILLENNIUM EARL] Why would
you ask something like that?

253
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,541
[LULU BELL]
Because you say you're happy,

254
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:56,166
but if you ask me,
you look miserable.

255
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,958
The fact of the matter is,

256
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,875
you're concerned about the
Fourteenth, are you not?

257
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,208
[LERO]
Are you, Lero?

258
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,125
[MILLENNIUM EARL] That's
ridiculous, of course not!

259
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:08,458
My nose is running, that's all.

260
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,833
I wonder if I'm catching a cold.

261
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,875
I'm pretty sure that came
from your eyes, Lero.

262
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,750
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
Don't be preposterous.

263
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:20,750
You're seeing things.
Now, let's be off, shall we?

264
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:28,583
Welcome to the
Fourteenth's secret room.

265
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,583
Even the Earl's never
seen this place.

266
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:35,416
He can't download what
he doesn't know exists.

267
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,666
Wait, I thought we fell.

268
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,541
What's happening here?

269
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,833
I thought this town
was destroyed.

270
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,041
But it's coming back!

271
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,750
[ALLEN] An unfamiliar song is
coming from inside my mind,

272
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:29,083
and its melody creates a
miracle before our very eyes.

273
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:32,375
On the next D.Gray-Man:
"Melody."

274
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:36,166
Bring forth salvation to
this poor Akuma's soul!

275
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:43,166
[CROSS]
Huh?

276
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:46,291
[CROSS]
You idiot!

277
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,375
That's it, go play the piano.

278
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:49,750
[ALLEN]
Huh?

279
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:51,791
I don't know how to play piano!

280
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,291
[CROSS]
No excuses!

281
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:54,583
Why me?

282
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:55,541
[SHADOW sighs]

283
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:56,625
[LENALEE]
Huh?
