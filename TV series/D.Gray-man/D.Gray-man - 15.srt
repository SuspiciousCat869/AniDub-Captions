1
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:55,416
Lenalee! Lenalee!

2
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,833
It's just like before.

3
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:03,875
You were there...
when I woke up.

4
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,041
Maybe you've forgotten it...

5
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,791
The day you came to The Order?

6
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:14,000
No... I remember.

7
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:16,875
Is Allen alright?

8
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,333
Yes, he's fine...

9
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:22,250
He's on assignment...
collecting Innocence with Kanda.

10
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:25,583
Oh...

11
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,208
Hey, you decided to wake up!

12
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,000
Thank goodness, do you
feel alright, Allen?

13
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,958
Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry, Lavi...

14
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,375
I'm sure I can...

15
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,041
You okay?!

16
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,416
Uh, yeah...

17
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,625
Grab my hand.

18
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,166
Thanks.

19
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,333
Idiot.

20
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,291
You feel so warm...!

21
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,666
Would you like me to
bring you a cool towel?

22
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,125
Uh, no... thanks.

23
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,250
It's alright, Allen, just relax.

24
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,791
You're pathetic.

25
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,666
You couldn't even take care
of one Akuma could you...?

26
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,541
We don't let them escape...
we finish them off.

27
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,541
Yeah, you don't
show any mercy, Yu,

28
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,333
to Akuma or to your teammates.

29
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,291
Where is Michael, the Finder?

30
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,125
How should I know?

31
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,333
He's not my responsibility...

32
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:57,208
Finders have to be able
to take care of themselves.

33
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,791
But he...

34
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,916
Michael!

35
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,125
Speak of the devil, we
were just talking about you!

36
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,083
Yeah, I saw the light
through the windows.

37
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,000
Well, we're glad you made it!

38
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,375
 Are you alright?

39
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,791
I'm fine.

40
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,666
Did you see any
Akuma around the cabin?

41
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,250
No, I didn't.

42
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,916
So they went ahead...

43
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,791
I'm going out...

44
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,250
I want to find the Innocence
and collect it before they do.

45
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,250
Nice--I'll come back you up...

46
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,833
You planning to get lost again?

47
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,208
Watch it, Exorcist.

48
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:40,166
Don't worry, Father,
I'll be right beside you.

49
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,000
Do you even care about
your daughter's safety?

50
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,375
None of us should leave now...

51
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:47,833
It's too dark...

52
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,041
Then maybe you
should stay here, 'kay?

53
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,208
Seriously, just kick back
and take it easy...

54
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,958
Get some rest.

55
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,458
Okay.

56
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,541
In that case, I'll stand by
here, too, until I'm needed.

57
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:04,958
Take care...

58
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:13,083
We'll see you soon!

59
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,041
It's like we're going
on a field trip, huh?

60
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,333
Be quiet.

61
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,125
You know, you really
need to lighten up, Yu...

62
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,833
I said be quiet!

63
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,625
Ah, the Exorcists...!

64
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,083
Shall we attack?

65
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,416
Don't be a fool.

66
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,875
Why would we do such a
thing when we can use them

67
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,750
to find the Innocence and
then take it for ourselves?

68
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:33,750
Oh, brilliant--indeed,
that sure is a smart plan!

69
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,166
The source of the snowstorm
is probably from a material

70
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,833
called Innocence, not
the Leaf of Revival.

71
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,125
And even if you did obtain it,
you still wouldn't be able

72
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,125
to bring back your
son as he once was.

73
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,458
That's enough!

74
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,083
It's likely that Akuma are
outside waiting for us,

75
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,166
you and your daughter
should turn back now...

76
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,750
Please, sir, only
Exorcists can defeat Akuma.

77
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,416
Father...

78
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,583
Let's go to bed now...

79
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,041
We can leave in the morning.

80
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,416
But, Elda...

81
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,791
I'm sorry, Allen, we have to.

82
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,000
Jacob, Jacob!

83
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,583
No...

84
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,500
Don't come in!

85
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,541
Jacob!

86
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,166
Don't...!

87
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,750
Father, get them
away from here...

88
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,333
Go!

89
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,208
No!

90
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,250
Elda, is everything alright?

91
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,416
Where's my Father...?

92
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,333
Look, do you think...

93
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,166
I want you to wait
inside the cabin...

94
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,875
We'll track him down soon.

95
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,083
I'll come, too!

96
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:05,583
But you...

97
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:06,625
No!

98
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,791
I can't lose
another one, Allen...!

99
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:12,416
I don't want any more regrets--I
have to try to save him!

100
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,000
Elda...

101
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,833
If I hadn't stopped my father
from going in after Jacob,

102
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:20,375
then he wouldn't be suffering
like this, so it's my fault!

103
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,375
You have no idea
how much I regret

104
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:25,541
surviving the fire
without my brother.

105
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,750
Fine... I understand.

106
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,208
Timcanpy...!

107
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,833
We're counting on you!

108
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,083
Is this it?

109
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,083
I guess, let's go see!

110
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,250
Oh, and just how do
you propose we do that?

111
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,000
Well... let's look for
a break in the weather...

112
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,791
Wood... Circle!

113
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,791
Wood Stamp!

114
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,833
Spinning Disc...!
Of heaven and earth!

115
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,500
I almost forgot...

116
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,458
Lavi's Innocence
possesses the ability

117
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:35,166
to manipulate and
control nature.

118
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,625
Why don't we get inside
while we still can?

119
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:37,250
Whoa... Hey, are you okay?

120
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,166
The Leaf of...

121
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:45,166
I found it.

122
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,958
The Leaf of Revival...

123
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:50,541
I found it--it
really does exist!

124
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,833
I'll be able to bring
you back to us now, Jacob.

125
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,625
Oh my dear boy!

126
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,333
Oh, Jacob... Jacob!

127
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:03,875
Stop!

128
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,500
It's dangerous!

129
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,458
Mugen... Un-sheath!

130
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,833
Wood... Circle!

131
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,666
It's... no good!

132
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,041
We've got what
we came here for...

133
00:10:56,125 --> 00:11:01,250
Let's go.

134
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,583
Please...

135
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:03,916
Give that to me...!

136
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,416
I need the Leaf of Revival
to bring back my son!

137
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,458
This is not the
Leaf of Revival...

138
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,958
It's called Innocence.

139
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,750
Give it to me!

140
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,000
No!

141
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,500
Innocence does
not have the power

142
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:20,041
to give your son back his life.

143
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,708
Accept it.

144
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm sorry, but what
he says is true.

145
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,583
Do you finally believe us?

146
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,583
I don't quite understand why,

147
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:36,375
but this Innocence somehow
came to live in this tree

148
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,583
and made its leaves shine,
causing many people

149
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,125
to believe that this
was the Leaf of Revival.

150
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:45,541
That's why they came
here to pick its leaves...

151
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,125
If that had continued to happen,

152
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,500
the tree would've
eventually died...

153
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,416
So the Innocence caused
massive snowstorms

154
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,333
and hot winds to prevent
people from coming near it.

155
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,875
It was protecting itself,

156
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:02,666
however, I don't think that
it meant to hurt any one of us.

157
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,000
Come on, let's go.

158
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,833
Yeah.

159
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,541
Well, the weather cleared up!

160
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,166
Head's up.

161
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,166
Now hand that
Innocence over to us!

162
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,791
You'd better stand back.

163
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,125
They must not get
the Innocence--

164
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:42,000
this time there's no escape.

165
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,875
Let me take care of
the one on the left.

166
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,208
No one's stopping ya!

167
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,500
Big Hammer... Little Hammer...

168
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,750
Grow, Grow... Grow!

169
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,875
Take, that!

170
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,666
How could you both
be so pathetic?

171
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,583
Stop!!

172
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,041
Stop it!

173
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:47,333
I see. She absorbed the others
into herself to become stronger.

174
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,666
You know she may be
even tougher than you.

175
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:58,416
Now... you will give
the Innocence to me!

176
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,916
She's a lot stronger now!

177
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,166
Hey...!

178
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,125
What the hell are you doing?!

179
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,125
Give it to me...

180
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,875
I need that thing!

181
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,458
Let go of me!

182
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,125
Ready...!

183
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,833
Yu!

184
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,083
Damn you...
give me back my son!

185
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,083
You... fool!

186
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,833
Take this!

187
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:41,875
Dammit!

188
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,125
It's--

189
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,875
We made it!

190
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,541
Innocence... activate!

191
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,083
Firing!

192
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:05,875
Allen!

193
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,250
Nuisance!

194
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,625
Hey...!

195
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,375
Quickly, free my legs!

196
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,041
Hurry up!

197
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,541
Whoa, what about me?!

198
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,333
Alright everybody, here we go!

199
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,250
Right...!

200
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,250
You ready, Kanda?

201
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:29,958
Please...

202
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,750
Please give it to me.

203
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,291
I don't believe this.

204
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,750
I have to bring
him back to us...

205
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,125
my dear little boy...

206
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,041
I want it to be like before.

207
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,625
Just one more time.

208
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,750
I'm sorry...

209
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:58,500
It's all because I stopped you
from going in to save him.

210
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,625
No!

211
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,458
I had no idea my actions

212
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,916
would cause you to
suffer this much, Father.

213
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,541
And that's why I can't stop you
from doing anything now,

214
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:14,708
even if it's chasing after a
Leaf that I know doesn't exist.

215
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:18,791
Don't you think it's
time you started

216
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,666
paying attention to your
child that's still alive?

217
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,333
You're so intent on
pursuing your lost son

218
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,958
that Elda is being
hurt and neglected.

219
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,833
Do you even realize that
you're treating this girl

220
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,375
as though she's
the one who died,

221
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:33,000
no matter how much
she's done for you?

222
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,833
Please, don't worry about me...

223
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,416
I understand how sad you are.

224
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:46,500
Really, I'm fine and
I love you, Father.

225
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,625
Oh, Elda.

226
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:00,166
I'll go ahead and take this
Innocence back to The Order.

227
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,958
What... you don't want
to wait and go with us?

228
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:07,125
No. I think I've had
enough of this field trip.

229
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:09,875
I guess we should
head out, too.

230
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,708
Oh, right.

231
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,875
Should we make our
way home as well?

232
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,458
I'm sure your
mother's worried sick.

233
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,666
Figures...

234
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,291
I guess I'll have to
wait and do it myself.

235
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,750
Lero?

236
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,833
Lero!

237
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,875
Leroooo!

238
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,708
Give him back...

239
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:51,333
Without Lero around
everything is so boring.

240
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,166
Fine...

241
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,625
I don't care what you do...

242
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm going after the
Innocence, so take him!

243
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,250
Oh, Lord Millennium told me

244
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,250
to tell you to
come back right now.

245
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:00,916
Why?

246
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,416
I don't know, Skin,

247
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,041
but I think we've
got some work to do.

248
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,625
Thank you so much...
for everything.

249
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:21,875
You're welcome.

250
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,333
We're planning
to stay one more day

251
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,208
and then go home to my Mother.

252
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,041
Before you go...

253
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,291
Yes?

254
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,958
Remember that it's not over,

255
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,916
you and your father
are still in danger.

256
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,250
Akuma are the result
of loss and tragedy.

257
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,875
They're used for dark purposes.

258
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:36,916
But how?!

259
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,291
Just be careful...

260
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,958
It's possible The Millennium
Earl might come for you.

261
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,416
If he offers to bring your
brother back from the dead,

262
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,083
promise me you won't listen.

263
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,750
We're not wishing
such things anymore...

264
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,041
I think we'll be too busy
loving the family members

265
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,416
who are still with
us here and now,

266
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,416
while both of us
look to the future.

267
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,708
I will not forget

268
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,166
to cherish these precious
lives ever again...

269
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:02,833
C'mere.

270
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,625
Oh, dad.

271
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,250
Goodbye!

272
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:15,541
I really hope the Millennium
Earl leaves Elda's family alone.

273
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,083
I'm reading your mind...

274
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,500
You know, you're an
open book, Allen...

275
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,083
It's true, if her brother were
to someday become an Akuma...

276
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:25,541
We'd have no choice but to
defeat him, because it's...

277
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:29,291
it's our gift and calling
as Exorcists, isn't it...?

278
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,791
We will always fight.

279
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,291
And protect those
that are in need.

280
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,666
So, what do you
think of Allen Walker?

281
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,541
I'm not sure yet...
but you know...

282
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:54,250
...somehow I don't imagine
his journey will ever be easy.

283
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,166
I mean, just look at him.

284
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,875
Let him be...

285
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:41,333
Kanda has gone missing while
on assignment in Rome...

286
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:43,583
We were dispatched to
rescue him and found

287
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:47,291
the legend of an immortal
swordsman waiting for us.

288
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:50,791
On the next episode
of D. Gray-man:

289
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:52,291
"Millennium Swordsman."

290
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:56,000
Bring forth salvation to this
tormented Akuma's soul!
