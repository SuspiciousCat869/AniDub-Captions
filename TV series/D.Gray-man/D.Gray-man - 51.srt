1
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,291
That's right.

2
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:44,166
I just heard from
the Asia Branch.

3
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,750
They wanted me to know
that our friend Mei Ling

4
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,458
returned to her village
safely and without incident.

5
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:49,541
She did?

6
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:51,458
I'm glad to hear that.

7
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,250
But I'm sorry to lose her.

8
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,708
I know we need as
many good Exorcists

9
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,500
as we can get right now.

10
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,791
I can't believe we finally
found an Accommodator

11
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:01,041
and her Innocence
was destroyed...

12
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,000
Try not to worry about it.

13
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,250
Besides, your assignment wasn't

14
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,000
to recruit and
train new Exorcists.

15
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,416
It was to find General Cross.

16
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,000
And guess what...?

17
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,458
We found him.

18
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:12,875
Allen!

19
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:23,250
Lenalee? Hello?

20
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:26,458
I'm about to be
reunited with my Master.

21
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:30,375
I guess I should be happy
but I don't know how I feel.

22
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:35,958
What's wrong?

23
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,333
Maybe it was nothing...

24
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:40,166
But I just got this feeling
we were being watched.

25
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,458
I bet it was a panda.

26
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:43,625
Oh, Allen.

27
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,041
You think pandas are
everywhere in China.

28
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:46,750
Aren't they?

29
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,125
No.

30
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,458
Hey guys, there's
a panda on the boat!

31
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,166
That's getting old.

32
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,375
Very old.

33
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,333
You really are an idiot.

34
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,833
How can you two just
sit there sipping tea?

35
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,916
General Cross is
just one village away!

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,583
Haste makes waste,
my frantic friend.

37
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,583
We've waited this
long to find him,

38
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,416
there's no reason to rush now...

39
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,833
And after all we've
sacrificed to get this far,

40
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,041
we should contemplate
our next move.

41
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,083
Look...!

42
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,708
If you're tired,
you can just say so!

43
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,166
He's right, Lavi.

44
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,000
This is too important
not to have a plan.

45
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,333
You know...

46
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,958
If I didn't know any
better I'd think you didn't

47
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:46,083
really want to find the General.

48
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:47,958
As long as we're here,

49
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,583
I think it would be a terrible
waste to be in this city

50
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,083
and not do some sightseeing...

51
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,125
What do you say?

52
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,791
It certainly is a lively place.

53
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,125
That's because Guangzhou

54
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,291
is the capital of
Guangdong Province.

55
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,083
It's a port city,
so it's a mix of cultures

56
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,250
and people from
all over the world.

57
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,875
You sure do know
a lot about it...

58
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,500
But that's not surprising
coming from the next bookman.

59
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,000
Since you grew up
around this area

60
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,791
I bet you know
a lot about China.

61
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,583
Coming back to your
homeland after all

62
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,208
this time must really bring
back a lot of great memories.

63
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,250
Well...

64
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah, but they're really vague.

65
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:24,125
Why would you
say they're "vague"?

66
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,500
I don't have any
memories of my life

67
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,291
before I joined the Order.

68
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,875
I can barely even
remember my own family...

69
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,916
As close as Komui are now,

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,458
I don't even remember
that much about him.

71
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:39,791
That's why everywhere
I am, even in China...

72
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,458
No matter what I look at,

73
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,625
I'm seeing it
for the first time!

74
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,416
Hey... This umbrella
is adorable, isn't it?

75
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,458
I had no idea.

76
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,458
It's just...

77
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,750
I haven't thought of China
as my home for a long time.

78
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,166
I know that must sound terrible.

79
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,500
There's only one place
I can call my home.

80
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,666
And that's the Order.

81
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,375
They're the closest
thing to a family I know.

82
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,416
And being with my family,

83
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,041
even on an assignment
like this, makes me happy.

84
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,291
I don't think
that sounds terrible.

85
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,708
We understand.

86
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,791
Sticking together is the
most important thing we do.

87
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,791
Yeah, it is.

88
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,291
If we didn't believe that,

89
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,291
do you really think we would
have come all the way across

90
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,750
the world to find General
Cross and bring him back...?

91
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:31,750
Allen, am I right?

92
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah...

93
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,750
It's not very easy to
put my grudge aside...

94
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,125
But I do it

95
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,208
because I know how important
Master is to the Order.

96
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,541
From Generals to Finders,

97
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,333
each member of the
Order is part of the team.

98
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:45,958
Okay...

99
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,333
We should start heading back...

100
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,250
The Old Man is
probably waiting for us...

101
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,666
And I don't really
want to add "being late"

102
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,041
to the list of reasons
he has to yell at me.

103
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,125
Sounds good...

104
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,333
Ready to go, Lenalee?

105
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,416
Sure.

106
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,208
Excuse me.

107
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,916
I'd like this one, please.

108
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,291
Timcanpy!

109
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,291
This is not good...!

110
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:10,750
We may know what
town the General's in,

111
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,208
but we need Timcanpy
here to track him down!

112
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm sorry!

113
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:22,916
Over there!

114
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,166
Activate!

115
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,958
Six of them.

116
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,500
Lavi, duck!

117
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,166
Are you crazy?

118
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,541
All right. Five more.

119
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,166
Just four more to go... Three.

120
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,291
Two!

121
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,958
Last one!

122
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,458
Fire Stamp!

123
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,916
Are you seriously
trying to kill me?

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,833
You're even scarier
than the Akuma!

125
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:08,000
What did I do that was so scary?

126
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:08,875
Are you kidding?

127
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,208
You can't just say duck

128
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:10,916
and start shooting over
people's heads like that!

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,250
This tea is excellent.

130
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,208
This is turning out
to be a good day, isn't it?

131
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,375
You didn't seem
to mind if I got hurt...!

132
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,041
Come on...!
You almost shot me!

133
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,375
Yeah, but I was
really careful not to!

134
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,000
Look out!

135
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,291
Hey... I'm back...!

136
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,416
Oh.

137
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,708
So, what are you two doing?

138
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:36,583
You know...

139
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,875
Just dealing with some Akuma.

140
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:38,791
They were here?

141
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,833
Yeah...

142
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,541
But they weren't
too much trouble...

143
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,375
It looks like you
finally found that cat...

144
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,083
Good job.

145
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,291
Thanks...

146
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:48,791
I'm glad I found him
before he was digested.

147
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,958
You sure have been getting
eaten a lot lately, Timcanpy.

148
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,458
You should try to be
more careful about that.

149
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,500
That was an even bigger
waste of time than I thought.

150
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:00,333
Hey...

151
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,333
Of all the places to sit...

152
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:02,875
Why my neck?

153
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,375
I had no idea we'd encounter

154
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,791
so many Akuma in
a place like this.

155
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:07,958
It could mean...

156
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,416
that Allen wasn't
imagining things

157
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,541
when he felt
someone watching us.

158
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,125
So...

159
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,666
You're saying maybe it wasn't
a panda spying on us after all?

160
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,166
You think the Akuma were
tailing us this whole time?

161
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,791
It's not us they're after,
it's the General.

162
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,583
It seems we should
be hurrying after all.

163
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:28,250
That's exactly what I said
when you were drinking tea!

164
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,625
Let's go.

165
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:42,000
So somewhere in that
big city is my Master.

166
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,000
I guess we ought to
split up and search for him.

167
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,250
There are a lot
of places to look.

168
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,083
At least there are
plenty of people to ask.

169
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,541
It's such a huge crowd.

170
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,833
It won't be easy
to find him in this.

171
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,708
We'll have to find
some information first.

172
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,416
I think I know the
gentleman you're looking for...

173
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,500
He's the red-haired foreigner
with a weird mask, isn't he?

174
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:04,958
If you buy just
ten more of those buns,

175
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,458
I'll tell you anything
you want to know.

176
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,500
The guy at the bun stand
told you General Cross

177
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,125
is the new boyfriend of
the lady who owns this place?

178
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,208
Yeah...

179
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,458
And from what
I know of the General,

180
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,208
I don't doubt it for a second.

181
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,916
This place looks pretty fancy.

182
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,541
I heard it's the most
popular spot at this harbor.

183
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:29,583
After all this time, we've
finally found General Cross!

184
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,416
We've come a long way for this.

185
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,375
The trip has been exhausting.

186
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,250
I'm so glad we found him.

187
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,416
We found him... Great.

188
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,416
Stop right there!

189
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,458
No first-timers allowed,
and definitely no kids...!

190
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,208
Why don't you get lost?

191
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,666
He's big!

192
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,791
It's got boobs...

193
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,416
I think he's a she!

194
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,375
We're... just passing through!

195
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,666
Can girls even get that big?!

196
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,708
We've got to get out of here!

197
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,791
Hey...! Put them down!

198
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,833
Sorry if this seems
a little rude...

199
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,083
but my Master has
been waiting for you...

200
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,583
I have orders to take
you straight to her.

201
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,750
You see, my Master and I are
both supporters of the Order.

202
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,583
Welcome, Exorcists...

203
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,208
It's such an honor to have you.

204
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,041
You can call me Anita...

205
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,708
The owner of this establishment.

206
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,333
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

207
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,458
So beautiful!

208
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,375
We hit the jackpot!

209
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,625
I don't know how to tell you
this, so I'll just say it...

210
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,166
If you're here
for General Cross,

211
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,250
I'm afraid you're too late.

212
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,041
He left some time ago...

213
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:44,250
On a ship.

214
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,333
The ship he was on...

215
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,500
we know it was attacked.

216
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,250
And it sank to the
bottom of the sea.

217
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,875
What did you just say?

218
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:03,666
I said the ship that Cross
was on was attacked at sea.

219
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,791
It sank eight days ago.

220
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,375
There were no survivors.

221
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:11,333
Do you have any
evidence to prove that?

222
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,791
The same ship that
received their distress signal

223
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,000
had made an
attempt to rescue them.

224
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,458
However...

225
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,833
The ship and its passengers
were nowhere to be found.

226
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,333
And in their place were nothing

227
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:26,208
but strange carcasses
and a poisoned sea.

228
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,833
Where was the General
headed in the first place?

229
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:33,041
What was the destination
of the ship he was on?

230
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,416
The others may have
died in the shipwreck...

231
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,083
But not him.

232
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,333
Do... you think so?

233
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:51,583
Mahoja...

234
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,041
Prepare my ship,
we will be leaving shortly.

235
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,333
Yes.

236
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:59,083
Anita.

237
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,875
For many years...

238
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,166
I have supported the Black
Order in any way I could...

239
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,166
From my mother's
time... up until now.

240
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,541
If you're going to continue
your search for Cross,

241
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,083
allow us to be your guides.

242
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,708
Our destination will be Japan...

243
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,625
And the very same
city that Cross hoped

244
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,500
to reach, the city of Edo.

245
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,250
Listen up...!

246
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,000
This little vacation
on the land is over...!

247
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,791
We'll be on the
water in no time.

248
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,291
Yeah!

249
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,625
Who are these losers?

250
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,500
I wonder if you could
help me find Yang.

251
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,083
You just found him...

252
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,416
You guys are
Exorcists, am I right?

253
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,125
Yes...

254
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:09,833
My name is Allen Walker.

255
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,208
And my name's Lavi.

256
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,166
It's nice to meet you,
I'm Arystar Krory the third.

257
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,166
Anita told us that you're
the captain of the ship

258
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,708
we're going to
be traveling on...

259
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,541
We want to thank
you for trouble.

260
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,041
You're thanking me...?

261
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,500
I'm not doing you any favors,

262
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,375
I just follow the
orders I'm given...

263
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:27,375
I'm doing this for money,
not some punk like you.

264
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,583
Still.

265
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:31,041
This is going to be
a difficult voyage...

266
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,708
Recently...

267
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,583
The vessel my Master
was on, was lost at sea...

268
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:39,666
They were all attacked...
by a group of Akuma.

269
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,958
We want to say we appreciate

270
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,625
you putting yourself
in harm's way for us.

271
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,708
With Anita on board, the sea
is the least of our worries.

272
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:47,500
Why's that?

273
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,750
You see kid...

274
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,833
She's got ways of making
you do what she wants...

275
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,125
If she wanted to set sail
in the storm of the century,

276
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,166
there's nothing we could
say to change her mind.

277
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,375
Don't worry about us...

278
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:58,916
Our job is protecting Anita

279
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,541
and that's what
we're going to do.

280
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,625
But you... are a
different story.

281
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,500
Just try your best to
stay out of our way, alright?

282
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,083
That won't be a problem.

283
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,958
We're perfectly capable of
taking care of ourselves...

284
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,083
Without us...

285
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,916
You wouldn't last a minute.

286
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,166
What'd you say?

287
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,708
All of us are Exorcists...
and that means...

288
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,166
we've been trained
to fight Akuma...

289
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,208
If we can't protect your ship...

290
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,375
then none of us
deserve our titles.

291
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,666
You really think
you can protect us...?

292
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,250
Just look at this
bean sprout arm,

293
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,208
you couldn't fight a
toddler with this thing.

294
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:35,541
It's all I'll need
to keep you alive!

295
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,833
I think your bark's
worse than your bite...

296
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:38,500
Hey!

297
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,666
Yes, sir!

298
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,416
If you're the guy
who's gonna keep me alive,

299
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,208
I'll need to see how much
muscle you've got on you.

300
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,000
I guess I don't have a choice.

301
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,916
Man, this sure turned to
arm-wrestling pretty quick.

302
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,833
And what happens
to us if you lose?

303
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,375
What if we get to sea and
they make us their slaves?

304
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,416
You don't want us to be whipped
and pushed around, do you?

305
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,833
Come out, come out!

306
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,708
Wherever you are!

307
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,375
Damn, kid...

308
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,666
You're pretty strong...
for a short stack.

309
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:25,750
Hang in there, Allen!

310
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:26,916
Please don't let them turn us

311
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,333
into slaves and whip us,
I have soft skin!

312
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,833
He beat the captain!

313
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,166
You really did it!

314
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,166
I'm so relieved...!

315
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,541
Excellent work, Allen!

316
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:53,250
No fair...!

317
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,375
I... I want a rematch!

318
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,208
How about I take on the winner?

319
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,541
What are you doing here?

320
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,416
I came here to accompany
you on your voyage...

321
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,708
I will follow
my master anywhere.

322
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,833
I want to protect her.

323
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,791
Umm... Anita.

324
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,291
What happened?

325
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:30,958
Oh, crap!

326
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,416
Don't whip me!

327
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,375
Duck!

328
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,041
Found you!

329
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,958
They actually exist... Akuma!

330
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,416
Find somewhere to hide...

331
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,000
We won't let them get
anywhere close to you.

332
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,041
I guess it was a
good try, Exorcists...

333
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,791
but you'll never get
past this Akuma army...

334
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:14,000
You've traveled a long way,
but this is the end of the line!

335
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,875
Never underestimate
an Exorcist...

336
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,125
If we want to cross the ocean,

337
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,916
we're not gonna let
you stand in our way!

338
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,875
Not bad...

339
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,583
So this is what
Exorcists are like.

340
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,541
If I had any doubts he
was Cross's apprentice...

341
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:53,625
They're gone...

342
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,750
He is Allen Walker.

343
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,916
I gotta admit, I'm impressed.

344
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,875
You just saved
everyone's lives...

345
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,375
I didn't think it was
possible, but you did it.

346
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,583
Thank you, Yang.

347
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,625
This journey might
be dangerous...

348
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,500
But with you on board,
I think we'll be okay.

349
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,791
I hope you're right.

350
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,041
Hey!

351
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:43,875
What do you think you're doing?

352
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,791
Come on, hurry up!

353
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,041
I thought we'd avoided
ending up like slaves.

354
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,750
But look on the bright side,
we're not being whipped.

355
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:51,875
Allen, over here!

356
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,041
Take this next!

357
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,458
Right!

358
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:59,791
We'll be leaving as
soon as the ship is ready.

359
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,125
I guess this is our last chance

360
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,041
to communicate
for a little while.

361
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,833
It's an island country...

362
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,458
I'll contact you as soon
as we're back in the area.

363
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,833
But shouldn't you talk
to the Chief before you go?

364
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:10,875
If I did that...

365
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,291
What would be
the point in calling

366
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,625
and checking in with
you, Section Leader?

367
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:15,541
Huh.

368
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,875
That's a good point.

369
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,083
But how did you know the Chief

370
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,083
was catching up on
some sleep right now?

371
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:23,041
Are you a psychic or something?

372
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,666
It was just a lucky guess.

373
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,750
I need that data analysis!

374
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:26,833
Is everyone doing okay?

375
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,458
You're not working
too hard, are you?

376
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,166
We're fine.

377
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,666
Don't worry about us.

378
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,750
You might be surprised

379
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,875
what we intellectuals
are capable of.

380
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:38,958
Just focus on getting
your crew back safely, okay?

381
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,583
Right.

382
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:42,541
Lero, lero.

383
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:43,666
So...

384
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,708
Why did you bring
so many Akuma here?

385
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,833
Oh, there have been some
alarming developments in China.

386
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,083
I thought it would be best

387
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:54,541
if we annihilated them
all at the same time.

388
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:55,583
Gotcha.

389
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,250
That sounds like a lot of fun.

390
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,208
Can I go, too?

391
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,000
No, no.

392
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,500
There's no need for that.

393
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:01,750
With this many Akuma,

394
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,666
I don't anticipate this
taking very long at all.

395
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,291
Aw...

396
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,166
You're no fun.

397
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,166
Now go, my precious Akuma!

398
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,708
And return to me victorious!

399
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,083
I assume you hear something.

400
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,166
I do...

401
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,416
I'm hearing a
great deal of noise...

402
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,166
A large swarm of Akuma
has started to move.

403
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,000
Very well.

404
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,000
It was only a matter of time

405
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:32,291
before our enemy
began to mobilize.

406
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,791
No matter how many there are,

407
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:38,500
every single one of
them will fall to my blade.

408
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:46,916
I really didn't want to go

409
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,500
to that country if
it could be avoided...

410
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,000
Stupid Master...

411
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,750
If I get there and you're
dead, I'll never forgive you.

412
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,416
I have to stop...

413
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,833
I shouldn't think like that...

414
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:01,000
He'll be just fine.

415
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,208
Prepare... to set sail!

416
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,125
You heard her, men!

417
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,833
Unfurl the sails!

418
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,291
Yes, sir!

419
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,125
In the middle of a battle,

420
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:45,000
a huge swarm of Akuma
almost block out the sun...

421
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,416
And from out of nowhere--

422
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:52,416
On the next D. Gray-man: "Raid."

423
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,500
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul!
