Yeah.

Our top priority is to find and
rendezvous with General Cross

We made it.

[CHOMESUKE]
Watch your step now.

14
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:36,291
Welcome to... Japan!

15
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,125
[BOOKMAN]
Japan is located in the far east

16
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,375
and is known as a
"closed country."

17
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,333
They've rejected trade
and interference

18
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:51,791
from the outside world
for nearly 300 years.

19
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:52,958
When you think about it,

20
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,041
the island makes for
the perfect hideout.

21
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,416
I wouldn't be a bit
surprised if the Earl

22
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,333
is the reason for that
300 year isolation.

23
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,791
Precisely.

24
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:03,791
What?!

25
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,750
And, who are you?

26
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,708
Don't you recognize me?
What about my voice?

27
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,041
Well. You sound familiar.

28
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,125
You're aren't... Chomesuke?

29
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,291
We got a winner.

00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,916

[LAVI groans, screams]

35
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,958
Such a novice.

36
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,750
[CHOMESUKE]
The Earl uses Japan as his base

37
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,333
to send Akuma into the world.

38
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,791
If you fought it, chances
are it deployed from here.

39
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,041
Then why doesn't the
government take action?

40
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,958
And how can this all go
unnoticed by the people?

41
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:53,083
It's difficult to stop when 90%
of the country's population

42
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,500
is made up of Akuma.

43
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:57,166
Make no mistake, the Earl
is the true emperor here.

44
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,250
Ninety?

45
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,500
Three centuries
under the Earl's rule.

46
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:04,041
Sounds like this is his own
island paradise. That's great.

47
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,791
There's not a single
place in this country

48
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:06,875
that's safe for humans.

49
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,958
You'd have to be
crazy to stay here.

50
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:13,875
But then again, it's not exactly
hospitable to Akuma either.

51
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,125

you mean by that?

And that's my friend, Kawamura.

of phenomenon happens.

In order to control their
impulse to kill humans,

they consume other Akuma and
absorb their abilities instead.

163
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,916
The name's Skinn.
Not "sweet tooth".

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,666
I'm only here 'cause the
General I was assigned to kill

165
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,125
fled to this country.

166
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,500
I'm just tightening
the noose, that's all!

167
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,833
Ah. You failed too.

168
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,083
Does anyone else get that
the impression the four of us

169
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,583
are about to get fired?

170
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,458
[SKINN]
I'm just tightening the noose!

171
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:22,916
[DEVIT]
I'm nothing like you two!

172
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,791
[JASDERO laughs]
The boss isn't gonna like this!

173
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:29,416
[JASDERO laughing]

174
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,416
[LAVI groans] I feel sick.
Think I'm gonna throw up.

175
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,000
[KRORY]
It's savage.

176
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:38,666
[BOOKMAN] To imagine Akuma feed
on each other with such frenzy.

177
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,541
[LENALEE grunts]

178
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,208
Are you all right?

179
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,208
I can go and fetch
some water if you want.

180
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,041
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

181
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,166
I'm sorry. What's your name?

182
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,125
You can just call me Chaozii.

183
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,291
I was a third-class
sailor on the ship.

184
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,208
Over there, we have
Maosa on the left.

185
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,625
And that's Kie on the right.

186
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,416
If you need anything,
you can count on us.

187
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,583
Good. Likewise.

188
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,500
[gulps]

189
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:07,083
[CHOMESUKE] This is bad.
I'm getting thirsty...

190
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:07,875
[KRORY, LAVI]
Uh?

191
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,083
Somethin' wrong, Sachiko?

192
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,958
Chomesuke is fine, thanks.

193
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,750
So what options do we have?

194
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,291
There are no options.

195
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:18,125
I'm gonna have to guide you
to Edo myself, so let's go!

196
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:21,208
[CHOMESUKE] And quick...
I don't have much time left.

197
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:21,750
[LAVI grunts]

198
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:22,458
[KRORY]
Hm?

199
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:23,208
[CHOMESUKE]
The Ark!

200
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,041
Now what, Sachiko?

201
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,625
You jerk! What did I tell you?
Call me Chomesuke!

202
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,125
What am I doing?

203
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,583
We don't have time to argue
about something so trivial!

204
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,708
Huh?

205
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,041
[CHOMESUKE gasping]

206
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,125
Chomesuke!

207
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:40,750
[CHOMESUKE groaning]

208
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,916
[CHOMESUKE]
Get out of here!

209
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,958
[LAVI, KRORY]
Chomesuke!

210
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:53,583
[AKUMA A laughs]
What a tasty dish.

211
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,041
[laughing]

212
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:02,166
[AKUMA A laughing]
Smart of me to wait for my food.

213
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,750
At first, when I smelled humans,

214
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:07,208
I thought it was just a pleasant
memory of a past meal.

215
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,250
Look at you delicacies.

216
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,250
You're not from this
country, are you?

217
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,583
More importantly...

218
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,416
...why is a pack of humans
on such friendly terms

219
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,416
with this Akuma?

220
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,666
[CHOMESUKE groans]

221
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,166
[LAVI]
Let her go!

222
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,000
[AKUMA A] How lovely.
I get dinner and a show!

223
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,250
[LAVI]
Are you alone?

224
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,416
[AKUMA A]
Of course.

225
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
[LAVI] What happened
to your two friends?

226
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:30,041
[AKUMA A] You humans will
never understand us.

227
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,416
[gasps]

228
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,500
The relief that only comes
from killing your kind.

229
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,125
Like quenching a thirst.

230
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,000
[CHOMESUKE gasping]

231
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,750
[AKUMA A]
I have the opportunity

232
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:43,958
to torture humans again. Why
would I want to share that?

233
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:48,666
[AKUMA A laughs]
Now. Time for the first course!

234
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,708
[yells]

235
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,916
[footsteps]

236
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
[TYKI]
So many memories.

237
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,000
I've only been here
a handful of times,

238
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,916
but it always manages to
fill with me nostalgia.

239
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,750
And I wasn't even born here.

240
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,791
I hear ya. It makes me
feel that way too.

241
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:18,166
The weird thing is I don't even
go for gloomy places like this.

242
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,541
Your genes are incapable
of forgettin',

243
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,666
and will always remind you
from whence you came.

244
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,166
[MILLENNIUM EARL chuckles]

245
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,666
[MILLENNIUM EARL] After all,
it was here that the Noah

246
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,833
survived the Great Flood
and sowed the seeds

247
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,250
of the second generation
of mankind.

248
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,875
We're standing where
the original descendants

249
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,083
of Noah were born.

250
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,666
Didn't I explain all
this to you before?

251
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,333
This place is the home
of all humankind.

252
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,208
But we call it by
another name...

253
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,291
...Noah's Ark.

254
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,666
[NARRATOR]
The story of Noah's Ark is told

255
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,291
in chapters six through nine
in the Book of Genesis

256
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,708
of the Old Testament.

257
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:56,125
In case it's needed,
here's a recap:

258
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,166
[MILLENNIUM EARL] When God saw
how wicked humans had become,

259
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,333
he vowed to destroy the
world with a great flood.

260
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,791
But a man named Noah was
allowed to build an ark

261
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,750
so he and his family
might be spared.

262
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:12,875
They were the only survivors.

263
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,958
The ark drifted across the ocean

264
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,791
until it came to rest
upon Mount Ararat.

265
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:21,083
It was there, God bestowed
Noah with a new covenant

266
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,833
and commanded him,
like Adam before,

267
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,125
to go forth and
replenish the earth.

268
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:30,375
Or so it's written in the
Holy Books of the great faiths.

269
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,750
[TYKI]
Hm. So this is home.

270
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,875
Only now it's been turned
into a factory for Akuma.

271
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:39,041
Humans and Akuma share the
same birthplace. How ironic.

272
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,833
[laughs] Hilarious!

273
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:46,000
[laughing] Unfortunately
the time approaches

274
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:49,208
when we must say farewell
to this ark forever.

275
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,916
And, good-bye to Edo.

276
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,833
We need to prepare for
the impending Ragnarok.

277
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,333
And that will require a ship
with different specifications.

278
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:00,250
A brand new model.

279
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:12,166
[chanting]

280
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,458
By the way. Since you're here,

281
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:39,666
I assume you've successfully
accomplished your missions?

282
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,291
[ALL]
Uh! Mostly.

283
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,125
I'll prepare a banquet
for us to share.

284
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:48,791
Then we can discuss your
failures in greater detail.

285
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:52,791
[LAVI yelling]

286

[chuckles]

288
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,833
As expected from a Level Three.

289
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,500
[AKUMA A]
It's useless!

290

[LENALEE]
Enough. I have to help!

[LENALEE gasping]

304
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,833
You can't fight!

[CHAOZII]
What?

307
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,666
We'll hold them back until
you can escape to safety.

308
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,791
Go! Now!

309
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,833
And where are we
supposed to run to?

310
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,666
There's nowhere on this island
that's safe for us to hide!

311
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,666
But...

00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,375
We came along to help you.

313
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:10,750
We're not going to abandon you
when the fighting starts.

[MAOSA, KIE grunt]

315
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,458
For the sake of our
comrades who died,

00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:15,833
we'll work until death!

Just say the word. We'll lay
our lives on the line!

There's no need.

Let's all survive so
we can back together.

00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:30,416
[LAVI, KRORY grunting]

322
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,375
[AKUMA A] You're not
challenging me at all.

323
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:37,291
At least put some
spirit in it. [laughs]

324
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,666
I've got an idea.

325
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,750
If I eat this one first, will
you be more motivated to fight?

326
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:43,916
Don't you dare!

327
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,875
[AKUMA A laughs]

328
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,208
[CHOMESUKE groaning]

329
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:52,958
You bastard!

330
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:53,791
[BOOKMAN]
Stop!

331
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,333
What for?!

332
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,291
Look.

333
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,833
[CHOMESUKE]
What are you waiting for, Lavi?

334
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:04,833
This is your chance! You can
escape while he's focused on me!

335
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,166
[gasps] Chomesuke...

336
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,250
Go. Now.

337
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,666
There's no way!

338
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,791
Calm yourself, Lavi. Think.

339
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,375
[LAVI]
I am thinking.

340
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,875
Huh?

341
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,541
We may escape this time,

342
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,958
but other Akuma
are gonna find us.

343
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,000
We need Chomesuke as a guide,

344
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:24,875
or we'll never make
it to Edo alive.

345
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,875
[BOOKMAN grunts]

346
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,916
[LAVI yells]

347
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,375
Innocence. Level Two... Release!

348
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:37,291
[LAVI yelling]

349
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:42,166
[LAVI]
Devouring Flame... Fire Stamp!

350
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:48,541
How many times are you planning
on trying the same trick?

351
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,583
[CHOMESUKE yelps]

352
00:17:58,875 --> 00:17:59,958
[CHOMESUKE]
Lavi!

353
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,208
You saved my life!
I thought I was dead!

354
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,000
Thank you!

355
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,958
Stop... I can't breathe...

356
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:08,750
[chuckles] While that was
a bit of unexpected fun,

357
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:13,291
there's no end to the amount
of webs I can produce! See?

358
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,083
I'm getting bored and hungry.
And so, I think I'll end this.

359
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,916
[AKUMA A laughing]

360
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,208
[blade slicing]

361
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,833
[AKUMA A]
Huh?

362
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:32,291
[AKUMA grunt]

363
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,583
[AKUMA B]
Just as I thought.

364
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,291
[AKUMA C] Look who's
sneaking behind our back.

365
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,000
Ha, ha. There they are.

366
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,000
[KRORY, CHOMESUKE]
Hm?

367
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,458
I see.

368
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,791
Not only was your Fire Stamp
effective against the web,

369
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,291
it worked as signal to
lure the other Akuma.

370
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,166
Our opponent said
it best himself.

371
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,666
He didn't want his friends
complicating matters.

372
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,458
But I didn't want 'em
to feel left out,

373
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,166
so I thought I'd
extend an invitation

374
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,125
for them to join
our dinner party.

375
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,875
You figured you'd just eat them
all and not share with us?!

376
00:18:56,958 --> 00:19:00,250
[grunts] The strong survive
and weaklings like you perish.

377
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,250
You're weak!

378
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,666
Just 'cause you're
not a Level Two

379
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,000
doesn't mean you're safe from
getting devoured by us!

380
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:09,166
Huh? Is that so? You think
I'm on the menu tonight?

381
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,250
It's fine by me.

382
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,208
You're dead!

383
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,291
Uncivilized.

384
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,416
If you're willing to kill
your own to prove strength,

385
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,875
you aren't fit to be called
allies in the first place.

386
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,875
[CHOMESUKE]
Hey! I found a way out!

387
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,416
There's a path
through the forest!

388
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,000
We can all escape while
they're distracted

389
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,333
but there's no time to waste!

390
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,625
Hurry before they notice us!

391
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:40,083
[JASDERO, DEVIT chewing]

392
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,750
This isn't sweet.

393
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,500
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
Of course not, Skinn.

394
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:52,041
I don't even want to imagine
something so vile.

395
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:55,125
[sighs] I'm growing weary
of raw fish these days.

396
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:58,208
I would hardly put pond
carp on the same level.

397
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,000
Wait. You were watching me?

398
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,208
[laughs]

399
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:05,166
Well anyway, I haven't
seen Road at all today.

400
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,458
I thought she was going
to be joining us.

401
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,250
[MILLENNIUM EARL]
Don't you worry about Road.

402
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:14,041
She's busy preparing
for the move. [laughs]

403
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,500
[CHOMESUKE] Looks like
if we follow this route

404
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,750
it'll lead us to Edo.

405
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,083
[LAVI]
Just as I thought.

406
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,208
[CHOMESUKE]
But if we take it,

407
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,458
I can't guarantee
any of your safety.

408
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,791
It's still not too late
to turn back around.

409
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:31,000
If they find us again, we won't
have a chance of surviving!

410
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,291
Regardless, we have to
keep pushing forward.

411
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,833
I agree.

412
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:35,916
[BOOKMAN]
Mm.

413
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,541
That's the reason
we came to Japan,

414
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,166
and we're not giving up now.

415
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,791
[ALL grunt]

416
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:45,500
[sighs] In that case,
stay close and follow me.

417
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,583
Try to keep up.

418
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:51,708
Watch out, Edo!
We're on our way!

419
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,333
[ALLEN] Despite the best
efforts from everyone

420
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:33,166
at the Asian Branch, it
simply isn't enough.

421
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,541
My Innocence fails to revive.

422
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:40,125
Only anxiety and frustration
grow in its place.

423
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:45,958
On the next <i>D.Gray-man</i> :
"Confusion and Impatience."

424
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:48,500
I already told you, Road.

425
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,166
I'm not gonna help you
with your homework.

426
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,208
[LERO]
Not, Lero!

427
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,791
Jeez...

428
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:53,416
[JASDERO, DEVIT]
Heh, heh.

429
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,541
Don't judge them.

430
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:57,000
They ain't sweet,
but they're friends.
