00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,041
[LAVI] Once he drinks them,
he'll be just fine.

165
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,625
[chuckles]

166
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,416
We're not finished, you brats.

167
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,000
In that case, vampire,
we'll just have to slay you.

168
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:29,625
[KRORY shouts]

169
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,541
What? Where?

170
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,666
[JASDEVI] Like we already said,
you're too slow!

171
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,750
[KRORY grunts]

172
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,708
[shouts]

173
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,625
[JASDEVI]
Y-You bastard!

174
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,208
[KRORY grunts]

175
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:50,083
[LAVI] We have to
believe in him, Lenalee.

176
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,916
I know the situation
seems almost hopeless,

177
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
but we have to trust
each other and fight on.

178
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,500
There's nothing else we can do.

179
00:09:58,583 --> 00:09:59,875
[gasps]

180
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:14,500
[KRORY grunts]

181
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:18,291
By the way, what did you
drink earlier? Looks red.

182
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,000
Don't tell us it's human blood.

183
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:27,125
[JASDEVI] Ah! It's the
blood-oil of an Akuma!

184
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,833
You actually drink this filth?
You must be insane!

185
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:33,208
Really? The taste actually
reminds me of tomato juice.

186
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:36,583
[JASDEVI] I didn't ask!
Man you're really creepy.

187
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,708
In fact, you must've been
considered an outcast

188
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,666
even among your own people.

189
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,250
Who wouldn't want to
run away after seeing you?

190
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,833
Now I understand why you're
comrades were so eager

191
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:49,958
to go on ahead. They couldn't
wait to get rid of you.

192
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:53,416
Because secretly,
they think you're a monster.

193
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,333
Now that you mention, I suppose
we do have something in common

194
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,416
[JASDEVI gasps]

195
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,208
[KRORY] What the matter.
Did that sting?

196
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:08,666
[JASDEVI] Wrong again, freak!
You're... the... monster!

197
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,666
[KRORY groans]

198
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,333
Die, you freak!

199
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:17,958
[KRORY shouts]

200
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,875
Looks like we'll have
to smash you flat

201
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:25,208
to keep you from regenerating...
A vampire sandwich.

202
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,958
[KRORY grunts, shouts]

203
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,708
[JASDEVI growls]

204
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,166
[JASDEVI] That's right.
You're supposed to drive a

205
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,416
stake through a vampire's
heart if you want to kill them.

206
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,916
Oh well.

207
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,333
[KRORY] It wasn't a wooden stake
that killed this vampire.

208
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:04,875
[JASDEVI]
Huh?

209
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,333
[KRORY] His death came, when he
drank the blood of the woman

210
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:12,583
he loved. The only person
allowed to call him vampire.

211
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:16,458
But, she's no longer
in this world,

212
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:20,583
so stop calling me that.
You're angering me!

213
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,708
[KRORY]
I'm an Exorcist.

214
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,666
Who won't rest until
your kind are destroyed.

215
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,000
I've no need for a coffin.

216
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:32,541
[KRORY grunts]

217
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,166
[JASDEVI shouts]

218
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,083
That really hurt! And how
are you still alive?

219
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,875
[KRORY grunts]

220
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,708
[JASDEVI] His hands look like
they're made out of rubies.

221
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,583
No. Not rubies. Blood.

222
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,000
\Somehow it's covering
his muscles like armor,

223
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,791
strengthening his attack.

224
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:54,500
So, the power of his Innocence
resides in his blood.

225
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,250
Still, that doesn't
explain how he survived.

226
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,458
He was practically
dead a second ago.

227
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:02,625
How did he recover so quickly?

228
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,875
Maybe being called a
vampire roused his anger

229
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,000
and was enough
to revitalize him?

230
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,166
No. That stuff only
happens in comics.

231
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,333
[gasps]

232
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,041
[JASDEVI]
Unless...

233
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,708
[JASDEVI]
That's a different flask!

234
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:20,000
The old man is powering up
by drinking Akuma blood!

235
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,500
[JASDEVI grunts]

236
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,750
[JASDEVI]
He's gone through two so far.

237
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,833
But how many more does he have?

238
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,250
If he drinks another,
it could be a problem.

239
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,750
[KRORY] One flask of
Chomesuke's blood left.

240
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:34,958
Should I drink it? No.
Better hold off for now.

241
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,708
[KRORY grunts]

242
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,500
I've no desire to
kill a child, however.

243
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,041
There's no need to worry!

244
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:45,333
You won't live long enough
to have any regrets!

245
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:49,375
[KRORY grunts]

246
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,416
What's up? Changing outfits?

247
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,083
You should start getting
dressed as well, Tyki.

248
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,583
[TYKI]
For what?

249
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,750
llen will be dropping
by any minute.

250
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:00,750
[TYKI]
Serious?

251
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,125
Dead serious.

252
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,875
What happened to Jasdevi?

253
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,541
[ROAD]
They're fighting an Exoricst.

254
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,875
But it appears they
let Allen get away.

255
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,125
Idiots.

256
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,291
Together, Jasdero and
Devit share the memory

257
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,041
of the bonds of Noah. And while
it's the strongest weapon

258
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,416
they have at their disposal,

259
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,500
on the other hand it's also
their biggest weakness.

260
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:19,833
[TYKI]
Huh?

261
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,500
[ROAD] If the bond between
them grows too intense,

262
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,875
it can lead to overconfidence.

263
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,750
Great. Just what they need.

264
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:29,041
Yes of course! I should
prepare dinner, too!

265
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:34,083
[JASDEVI, KRORY grunting]

266
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,750
[JASDEVI]
Hard to imagine a small flask

267
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,708
could give you
this much energy!

268
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,083
[KRORY]
How kind of you.

269
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:48,333
[JASDEVI]
Hey. That wasn't a compliment!

270
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:53,375
[JASDEVI, KRORY grunting]

271
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,583
[JASDEVI] So. Do you have
any of that Akuma blood left?

272
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,583
That blood's purpose
is to kill humans.

273
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,833
Yet, Innocence created a monster
that draws strength from it.

274
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:08,416
Shows you how evil
Innocence really is.

275
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,125
How can you still deny it?

276
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,291
Surely by now you realize how
much of a freak you are.

277
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,916
What do you think?

278
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,416
Also, you believe
this can hold me?

279
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,000
Ha! What do you think?

280
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,625
[KRORY]
Better stop.

281
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,875
[KRORY]
You'll go bald.

282
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:31,916
You jerk. You're starting to
become a real pain in the ass.

283
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,916
[KRORY] Seems I'm evenly
matched with him.

284
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,875
At least in terms
of brute strength.

285
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,958
At this point. If I were to
drink the last remaining flask,

286
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,333
I'd probably be able
to finish him off.

287
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:45,416
However, I wouldn't survive.

288
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,333
[KRORY]
Then it's not my imagination.

289
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,875
My body is becoming poisoned
by the Akuma blood

290
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,041
I've already consumed.

291
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,875
That first attack I experienced
at the hands of this Noah

292
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,916
severely weakened me.

293
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,416
That's when I first
drank the Akuma blood,

294
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,166
but I must have taken
too much in too quickly.

295
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,750
It appears my body's ability
to neutralize the virus

296
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,291
was also weakened.

297
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:12,250
[JASDEVI]
Well? What are you waiting for?

298
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,750
Something on your mind?

299
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,750
[KRORY] If I were to drink
the last of the blood,

300
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,250
I'd gain enough strength
to defeat Jasdevi.

301
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,291
But it'd kill me!

302
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,708
[KRORY, JASDEVI scream]

303
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:27,791
[JASDEVI, KRORY grunting]

304
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,250
[groans]
The virus again!

305
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,291
Got you!

306
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,666
[KRORY screams]

307
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,708
[KRORY grunts]

308
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,916
[JASDEVI]
It's not over.

309
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,416
You haven't suffered
nearly enough

310
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,708
for helping Allen Walker
and his friends escape!

311
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,750
[KRORY grunts]

312
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,500
[JASDEVI]
Crash and burn!

313
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:55,166
[KRORY grunts]

314
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,583
Damn virus.

315
00:16:56,666 --> 00:17:00,083
At this point, there's no
reason to worry about it.

316
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,333
[JASDEVI] Are you thinking
about drinking that last flask?

317
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:05,041
[KRORY gasps]

318
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,916
You're wondering how we
knew you only had one left.

319
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,125

really the last one?

[KRORY] I see. When they
were attacking me earlier,

they must have woven
a few strands of hair

into my clothes!
