1
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:44,625
Oh, Eliade!

2
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:46,500
How they feel can't be helped...

3
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,708
Don't you see, Arystar...?

4
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:53,125
They are human,
and you are a vampire.

5
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,125
My dearest Eliade...

6
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:58,458
I will love you...

7
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:00,375
With all that I have...

8
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:04,625
Let's live here in this castle
forever, you and I alone...

9
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,125
Yes...

10
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,708
Forever... and ever...

11
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:12,625
Pentacles... on the
surface of the ground.

12
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:15,333
No mistake...
traces of Akuma blood.

13
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:16,791
Agreed...

14
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:20,750
Could this be a graveyard
for... for Akuma?

15
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:30,041
Allen, the pentacles are
showing on this one, too!

16
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:31,666
I'm afraid we're going
to find the pentacles

17
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,000
on every one of these graves.

18
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,875
I don't know...

19
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,541
But I do think...

20
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:49,291
There's a lot more going
on here than vampires.

21
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,625
I can't believe
they're still alive...

22
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,833
They're like a couple
of stubborn cockroaches.

23
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,083
If I ignore this it will
only be a matter of time

24
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,500
until they figure
out what's going on

25
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:04,625
and try to take Arystar
away from the castle.

26
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,250
That's why, under no
circumstances

27
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,916
can I let them leave...

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,208
Unless, of course,
they're both inside coffins.

29
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,750
I wonder what that
shaking was earlier.

30
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,875
Dear Grandfather...

31
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:24,458
Do you remember what you
said to me before you died...?

32
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:27,000
You said that the only place
I would ever find happiness

33
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:32,375
is here in this castle,
tending to our flowers.

34
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,416
And now it seems as
though following this path

35
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,916
is the only choice with
which I've been left.

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,916
Grandfather...

37
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,708
I've become a real vampire, the
one thing I've tried to avoid...

38
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,083
The villagers all fear me...

39
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,833
Too afraid of what
I might do to them,

40
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:51,375
they all avoid even
being in my presence.

41
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:55,375
I realize my fate is
now set in stone...

42
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:58,625
I will live here
until death takes me.

43
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,500
But why am I crying...?

44
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:09,083
For I will always have
my dear Eliade by my side.

45
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,125
Grandfather.

46
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,708
Is this a curse you've
placed upon me...?

47
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,458
You knew I'd always yearned
for the outside world...

48
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:21,500
And even as a child I made it
my goal to break your very will,

49
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,583
but it seems as if
you've changed me...

50
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,333
Turned me into a
monster to ensure

51
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:29,500
that I never venture beyond
these walls in my lifetime.

52
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,541
Oh... Arystar,
I've been looking for you!

53
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,583
Eliade.

54
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,791
Oh my, what's wrong?

55
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,458
There are men outside
claiming to be exorcists!

56
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,625
They snuck into the castle
and want to murder you...!

57
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:50,125
They tried to attack
me but I got away.

58
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,333
They did what?

59
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,708
They even burned
all the flowers...

60
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,833
The ones you love at the
bottom of the staircase.

61
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:57,708
Of course...!

62
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:02,083
That must've been what I felt...

63
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,541
Those bastards...!

64
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,375
How dare they destroy the
flowers Grandfather gave me.

65
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:10,708
Please Arystar...
defend this castle...

66
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,125
You must fight them.

67
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,500
But... I... don't know.

68
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,833
If you don't stand up and
do something about this,

69
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,166
they will kill you...

70
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,083
You're a vampire...

71
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,625
You're already
their natural enemy.

72
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:28,125
Please drink my blood...
now...

73
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,125
Eliade...

74
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,458
The exorcists are
strong, Arystar.

75
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,833
You won't stand a
chance against them

76
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,250
in the state
you're in right now.

77
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,166
But if you drink my blood,

78
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,791
you should be able to
transform into a vampire

79
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:43,458
more powerful than
they could ever imagine.

80
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,916
But promise me
you'll be careful...

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,500
You need only drink a little...

82
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:53,625
Just don't... kill me in
the process, my love...

83
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,708
Eliade.

84
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,250
Arystar... Do it.

85
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:02,708
Then we can live the rest
of our lives in peace...

86
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,500
You're all I have
in this world...

87
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,625
Eliade.

88
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,583
You know I noticed
something earlier.

89
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,375
Why don't you tell me
while you keep shoveling?

90
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,083
I've smelt the scent of those
carnivorous flowers before...

91
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,666
I think they triggered
a distant memory...

92
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,541
It was from awhile
ago with Master Cross.

93
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,750
He was growing flowers
that smelled just like that.

94
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,625
Really?

95
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,833
The only thing is the flower
he was growing was in a pot.

96
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,208
But I'm certain it
was the same kind.

97
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:39,125
So you think the flowers were
planted by General Cross?

98
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:42,583
All I think is that it's
possible the two are related.

99
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,083
I think I found it.

100
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,708
Just as we thought...

101
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,708
It's an Akuma.

102
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:04,041
Every one of these
graves contains an Akuma.

103
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,458
The pentacles we've
seen on the ground

104
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,708
must have appeared once
each of the bodies decayed

105
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,041
and then leaked the
virus into the soil.

106
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,250
Do you realize what
this means, Lavi...?

107
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,791
All of the villagers Count Krory
has attacked have been Akuma.

108
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,333
Of course...

109
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:21,541
If the Count is only attacking
Akuma and not human beings...

110
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,000
Then this mission
is no longer just

111
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:26,416
a cut-and-dry
vampire elimination...

112
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,291
Krory must be something else.

113
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:29,708
That's right...

114
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,708
If Krory isn't a vampire
like we originally thought...

115
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,333
Lavi!

116
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,958
You two have made
me very angry...

117
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,666
Count Krory is no vampire...!

118
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,416
He's actually a...

119
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,833
He's a...!

120
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,250
I can't believe his speed!

121
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,916
Count Krory...!
Please hear me out!

122
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,416
You afraid you're going to end
up like your little friend?!

123
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,708
He disarmed the
weapon on his left arm.

124
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,958
All I want to do is talk.

125
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,000
The bodies of these
villagers in those graves.

126
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,791
They're Akuma, not human...

127
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,458
Were you aware of that?

128
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:43,541
In fact, do you even know the
difference between the two?

129
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,250
Akuma?

130
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,458
Count Arystar Krory...

131
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:51,125
Are you a vampire,
or are you something else?

132
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,666
Mind your own business...

133
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,083
Got it?

134
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,000
Your blood tastes disgusting.

135
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,125
Yeah...?

136
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,541
That must be because
it's human blood.

137
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,625
Human?

138
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,125
Don't kid yourself...

139
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,458
You're a monster
and you know it.

140
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,041
Akuma and vampires have
nothing to do with me...

141
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,500
Do you hear me my boy...!

142
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,708
I'm just a simple man who
lives inside this castle.

143
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,375
With the lovely Eliade...

144
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:28,708
Just the two of us living
here undisturbed for eternity!

145
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,541
And I promise...

146
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,458
I'll kill those
who get in my way...

147
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,291
Including you!

148
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,333
That was quick.

149
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,625
You shouldn't ever
turn your back on me...

150
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,750
It takes a lot
to keep me down...

151
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:13,541
So I'll just kick your ass now
so you and I can chat later.

152
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,250
Interesting.

153
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,416
Take this!

154
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,583
My head is killing me.

155
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,291
I must have slammed into that
wall pretty hard or something...

156
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,458
What the heck...?

157
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,166
Either I'm hallucinating

158
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,833
or there are stars
circling around my head...

159
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,125
Geez Tim...

160
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,416
Quit it.

161
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,000
Playing hard to get, huh...

162
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,250
Well... It sounds
like Lavi is feeling better...

163
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:20,166
I guess I should go back him up.

164
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,541
Where am I?

165
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,666
What is this?

166
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,916
Ugh, my head's still spinning.

167
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,583
What the...

168
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,625
Is this some kind
of secret room?

169
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,041
What is that?!

170
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:12,500
You're pretty tough, aren't ya?

171
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,125
Could that shadow be a...

172
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,041
It's gone...

173
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:35,375
Maybe I really am
hallucinating after all.

174
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:38,833
It's you...

175
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,041
Hello...

176
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,666
If it isn't the
gray-haired boy from before.

177
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,083
Seriously...

178
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,125
Pathetically busting into
a woman's private room

179
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,250
of secrecy is so uncouth...

180
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:52,083
I believe someone could use
a lesson in proper manners.

181
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,541
Aww...

182
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,291
It looks like you were bitten.

183
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,291
I know...

184
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,583
I was hoping it
would heal by now.

185
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:10,916
Why are you doing
this...? Let me go.

186
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,500
Oh Arystar...

187
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,583
I knew I couldn't trust you to
take care of this little twerp.

188
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,166
How annoying...

189
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,000
I let him suck my blood and he
still couldn't finish the job...

190
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,958
Must I do everything
all by myself?

191
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,541
Well so be it...

192
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:29,166
Luckily for me I have the
time to kill you on my own,

193
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,000
you exorcist scum!

194
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,916
Where is she getting
all this strength?!

195
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:48,875
What's wrong boy?

196
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,083
Aren't you going to fight back?

197
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,041
I feel dizzy and like
I'm getting a fever.

198
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:01,666
It must be the effects
from where I was bitten.

199
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,166
I'm so sleepy.

200
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,708
No response?

201
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:15,083
Maybe Arystar was more
effective than I thought...

202
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:18,291
Come on, can't you
put up a little fight?

203
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,583
No...

204
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,250
I must resist the
urge to fall asleep...

205
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,666
If I don't she'll kill me...!

206
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,375
Snap out of it, Allen!

207
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,500
Please stop...

208
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:35,041
I'm not fighting back
because I don't have reason to.

209
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,500
I also have no intentions of...

210
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,583
Eliminating
Arystar Krory either...

211
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,166
Because he isn't a...

212
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,625
Akuma, and he's not a vampire.

213
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,708
The villagers Arystar killed...

214
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,375
Every one of them were Akuma...

215
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,416
It's possible that
Krory could be one of us,

216
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,166
a full-fledged Exorcist.

217
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,583
If that turns out to be true
we will escort him home with us.

218
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,458
You really think
he's an Exorcist?

219
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,541
You must be suffering
from brain damage!

220
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,416
He's just a vampire, silly...

221
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,625
And he will...
stay with me... forever!

222
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,375
He and I will live
here for eternity...

223
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,666
Huh?

224
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,541
I will never let you
steal Arystar from me...

225
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:30,750
Got it?!

226
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,041
You know where you
belong, Exorcist?

227
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,708
In a grave.

228
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,583
And I'm going to make
that happen for you.

229
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,208
That move actually surprised me.

230
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,375
Just as I thought...

231
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,416
It looks like you
really are one of us.

232
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,916
Excuse me?

233
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,333
Every one of those villagers
you attacked was an Akuma...

234
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:21,083
The only kind of human
that can survive a vampire bite

235
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,375
is a Parasite Type
Accommodator...

236
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,041
Which is what you are...

237
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,000
Follow me...

238
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,250
Afraid all the evidence
is there, Krory...

239
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,541
And it confirms that
you are an Exorcist,

240
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,250
whether you like it or not.

241
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,875
Oh yeah...?

242
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,875
You think I'm that naïve?

243
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,041
No...

244
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,500
You were just going
after Akuma's blood

245
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,416
without realizing it because
the consciousness that is

246
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,166
within Innocence will
hunt Akuma on its own,

247
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,750
with or without
your permission...

248
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,083
In other words,

249
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,958
you're beginning to
synchronize with Innocence.

250
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,208
Ya know...

251
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,708
You seem to get a kick
out of hunting Akuma...

252
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:58,250
If you join my friend and I,
you could hunt all you want.

253
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,875
I'm not interested.

254
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,250
I thought you'd say that.

255
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,666
I recall you wanted to wait

256
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,000
to have a conversation
until after you beat me.

257
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,250
Well... That was my
original plan...

258
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,125
But seeing that you're much
stronger than I anticipated...

259
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:18,291
I thought it'd be a
good idea to talk first.

260
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,208
We're beyond diplomacy now
so I won't be holding back...

261
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,708
So just give me your
answer once you wake up...

262
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,166
Fang-boy.

263
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,916
Don't you sound confident...

264
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,375
Maybe now I'll break a sweat...

265
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:30,208
You'll see...

266
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,625
Just you wait.

267
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,916
Innocence... Level Two Release!

268
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,250
Arystar and I had
planned on living together

269
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,750
here in this castle,

270
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:52,125
completely isolated from the
world outside our gates...

271
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:55,791
Forever, that is before you
and your friend showed up.

272
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,083
When I introduced you
to my flowers last night

273
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,458
it was a warning to turn
your back and leave...

274
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:04,708
You had your chance, but now
you're mine to play with...

275
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,833
A good idea would be
to chop off your head

276
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,875
and place it on a stake
in front of the castle...

277
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,875
As a reminder to all fools

278
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,833
who think they can hassle
us and get away with it.

279
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,875
I would gain honor
amongst the ranks

280
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,208
for taking off
this Exorcist's head

281
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:25,000
and most importantly the
Earl would praise me for it.

282
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,625
More than anything...

283
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,416
Arystar and
I could be together...

284
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,833
Forever!

285
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,333
You little faker...!

286
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,416
Is he unconscious or not?

287
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,416
Is he possessed...?

288
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,291
His left arm is
moving all by itself...

289
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,750
But how?

290
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,500
I have returned, Allen...

291
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,875
The darkness is back.

292
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,125
Mana...

293
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,250
Do you remember the last time

294
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,125
I couldn't see out
of my left eye...?

295
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:54,458
I decided that even if
I lost that ability forever,

296
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:58,458
I'd still grow up strong and
train to join the Black Order...

297
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,416
Just like an exorcist...

298
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,083
I will be prepared...

299
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,708
Mana!

300
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:08,000
Now Allen...
you must go deeper...

301
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:12,458
...into the realm
of black... and white.

302
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,958
Thanks Mana.

303
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,666
Your arm...

304
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,791
It's...

305
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,000
Eliade...

306
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,666
You are an Akuma.

307
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,708
Now I see...

308
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,541
You're the Akuma
we saw last night.

309
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,291
Your eye is finally healed.

310
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,458
Black and white...

311
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,625
My world has finally returned.

312
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,583
You see my true form...

313
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,041
That's right...

314
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,541
I take back what
I said before...

315
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,666
I do have reason to fight now.

316
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:40,416
There's the beautiful
Akuma known as Eliade

317
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,250
and Krory, the supposed
vampire who can defeat Akuma...

318
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,166
The true meaning
behind their relationship

319
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,958
has finally become clear.

320
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:52,625
Next time on D. Gray-man:
"The Truth About Eliade."

321
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:55,875
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul.
