1
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:43,708
Two hundred ninety...

2
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:45,416
seven...

3
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,250
Two hundred ninety-eight...

4
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:52,708
Two hundred ninety-nine...

5
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:54,500
Three hundred.

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,625
What a beautiful morning.

7
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:18,833
Kanda...

8
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:21,166
What was that sound just now?

9
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,500
I don't know...

10
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,583
Wait a minute, why am
I even talking to you...?

11
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:25,750
Get lost.

12
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,750
But what if someone
was in an accident?

13
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,208
Oh please...

14
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,250
As if you would
even do anything.

15
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,500
I bet his assignment
didn't go as he had wanted.

16
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:36,375
That's probably why Kanda's
being so grumpy this morning.

17
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,875
I guess so...

18
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,791
Lenalee, did you happen to
hear that loud crash just now?

19
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,375
It was most likely
the Science Division

20
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,333
working on an experiment...

21
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,791
I'm sorry about
my brother and his team.

22
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,250
They can be noisy sometimes.

23
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,791
Oh, don't worry about it...

24
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:50,833
Well...

25
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,125
My next stop is
to the dining hall.

26
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,125
You can't go there!

27
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,291
Not just yet!

28
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,666
It's just that everybody

29
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,625
is in the middle of
cleaning down there.

30
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,916
Plus we shouldn't
bother Jerry right now.

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,916
Oh, well, I'll go down
there and give him a hand.

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,125
No!

33
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,333
I'm pretty sure they
have plenty of hands...

34
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,708
Why don't you help me
deliver some coffee

35
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,541
to my brother and
the other scientists?

36
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:09,333
What do you say?

37
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,166
No problem, I can do that.

38
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,875
Section Leader Reever,
why do I get the feeling

39
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,625
this project will never
end in our lifetime?

40
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:22,708
Don't give up, Johnny.

41
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,000
It'll end soon
enough... hopefully.

42
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,250
That reminds me.
We need to get

43
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,416
to a good stopping point
by the end of the day.

44
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,750
Don't forget.

45
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,458
We're throwing a welcoming
party for Allen later.

46
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,250
Hey, Number Sixty-Five...

47
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:36,250
Up for lending your
MC talents to the party?

48
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,000
I could keep that
party going all night

49
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,333
if any of you could handle it.

50
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,708
Oh, man, you have no
idea how much money

51
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,333
I'd pay for a skill like that.

52
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,000
Geez, what's the
Chief doing in there?

53
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,666
Doesn't he know how much
work we have on our plates...?

54
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,583
The least he could do is come
help us out for awhile.

55
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,000
Take it easy, Johnny...

56
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:57,375
Who knows, he might be
inventing something brilliant.

57
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,416
Come on!

58
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,291
Hey, everyone...!

59
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,958
How'd you like to meet the
Savior of the Science Division?

60
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,166
Huh?

61
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,875
I think he's gone mad.

62
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:23,416
Komui what is the point of
that ridiculously large robot?

63
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,291
Wait, is that thing
wearing a hat?

64
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,833
Allow me to introduce

65
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,333
to you the state-of-the-art
advanced productivity robot...

66
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,833
And the best part...?

67
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,083
We won't have to work
as much from now on!

68
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,333
Are you sure?

69
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:36,750
Of course I am!

70
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,166
As long as this robot's around,

71
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,666
our workload will
be reduced by...

72
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,750
Fifty percent!

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,375
Fantastic!

74
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,250
Maybe now we can get some sleep!

75
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,875
Wow, you called it, sir...

76
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,375
Chief Komui really was
inventing something brilliant.

77
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,708
How did you know that?

78
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:55,833
I...

79
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,541
We're so lucky to have you, sir!

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,833
Yes, yes...

81
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm a master of science...

82
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,875
Now why don't you all shower
me with groveling praise?

83
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,958
As the night exists
to await the dawn...

84
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,125
golden rays of hope are
shining down upon us

85
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,458
with dreams of relaxation!

86
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,875
It's about time we got some
well-earned vacation...

87
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,333
I'll finally be able
to visit my son!

88
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,041
Chief, we should
boot it up right now

89
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,541
and see how it works!

90
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,541
We'll do that as soon as we
come up with a name for it.

91
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,666
Huh? You want to
give it a name?

92
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,750
Let's see, what would
be a good one...?

93
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,125
If anyone has any
suggestions then speak up.

94
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,208
I don't know...

95
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,500
How about Mister
beep-boop-beep-boop?

96
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,541
Uhh, no.

97
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,166
Innocender Z!

98
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,500
Eww... no!

99
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,875
Why don't you go ahead
and pick the name, Chief.

100
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:50,958
Okay...

101
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,666
How about...

102
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,125
Sir Komlin the Second!

103
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,500
I guess that works
but why is it the second?

104
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:01,875
Well...

105
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,583
because the first one
lived a very short life...

106
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:07,208
It met its end when Kanda
decided to slice it into pieces.

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,916
He claimed that it ate his
soba noodles or something.

108
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,583
Or he pitied it and
put it out of its misery.

109
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,125
Yeah or maybe Kanda
was just in one

110
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,541
of his famous grumpy moods.

111
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:18,958
Either way Chief,

112
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,583
we think Sir Komlin the
Second is a fantastic name...

113
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:22,458
Right?

114
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:23,541
Sure do!

115
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:24,500
Great...!

116
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:25,833
Then it's decided.

117
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,875
Sir Komlin the Second...!

118
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:30,791
I'm counting on you son!

119
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:35,750
Komui.

120
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,291
Time for a break.

121
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,000
Lenalee, hello.

122
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,083
Who wants some coffee?

123
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,708
I'd love some.

124
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,166
Why are you here?

125
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,458
Oh, I...

126
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,583
I had asked him to
help me carry the coffee.

127
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:50,250
Well...

128
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,166
Help yourself everybody.

129
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,708
Wow, I had no idea
robots could drink coffee.

130
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,416
How funny.

131
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,875
You still have a
lot to learn Allen.

132
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,916
He may be my alter-ego,
but he is still only a robot.

133
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Everyone knows robots are
incapable of drinking fluids.

134
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,541
Oh no, he drank it.

135
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,291
That can't be very good.

136
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,083
I am Sir Komlin the Second,

137
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:26,208
and it is my duty to aid in
strengthening Exorcists.

138
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,416
That's it boy, that's it.

139
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,125
You're doing really well.

140
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,333
Keep it up.

141
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,500
Chief, does your robot
have an off switch,

142
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,583
because I think
something's wrong with it!

143
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,208
What the hell are you doing

144
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,625
talking like that
in front of him!

145
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,833
You're going to give him a
complex, he's just a baby!

146
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,833
A perfect, innocent baby!

147
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,000
Take it easy, Brother.

148
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:48,958
I must operate on this
woman to make her more manly.

149
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:49,250
Huh?

150
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,375
Why would anyone want
to make Lenalee more manly?

151
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,666
No, Sir Komlin the Second!
You can't do it!

152
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,916
You can't!

153
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,125
But she needs strengthening,

154
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:04,083
and the only way to do
so is by butching her up.

155
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,166
She wants it.

156
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,708
She needs it!

157
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,208
Run, Lenalee, run!

158
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,416
Get out of here!

159
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,083
She must not escape
before the operation!

160
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,541
Lenalee!

161
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:17,208
Oh no!

162
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,500
What should we do?!

163
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:19,875
I'm getting excited
and I don't even know why!

164
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,375
Why would you even
say something like that?!

165
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:23,041
Quick...!

166
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,041
Somebody stop him!

167
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,041
I think he's gonna
eat my sister!

168
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,375
Geez, why don't
you panic already...?

169
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,625
Now where did I put
that stupid thing.

170
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,125
Chief...!

171
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,333
You're gonna have to show me
where that main circuit is!

172
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:36,750
Huh...?

173
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:37,791
Oh, that's right...

174
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,875
What...? NOOO!

175
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,708
You can't destroy my baby!

176
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,125
Not after the hours upon hours
of blood, sweat, and tears

177
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,333
I put him into making him!

178
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,791
So put down that gun,
you murderer!

179
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:49,541
Okay...

180
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,916
So you don't care?

181
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,583
Forget about Lenalee?

182
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,666
AHHHH!

183
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,541
Now I don't know what to do!!!

184
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,583
Just make up your mind.

185
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:58,333
Brother...!

186
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,958
Get me down from here!

187
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,041
OHHHH!

188
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:04,333
I'm trying my best,
my sweet sister!

189
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,875
I... love my sister...

190
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,250
But I also love
Sir Komlin the Second...

191
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,666
What a moral quandary!

192
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,000
Of course...

193
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,833
I completely forgot,
that Allen is with us today.

194
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:20,791
Sir Komlin...!

195
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,375
I've got great news...

196
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,750
It turns out that our
newest Exorcist Allen Walker

197
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,833
is having trouble with his
Anti-Akuma Weapon.

198
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,875
What?

199
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,125
Do you think you
could fix it for him?

200
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,833
An injury.

201
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,208
Huh?

202
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,708
Dammit Chief!

203
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,416
Looks like the Chief's
throwing Allen to the wolves.

204
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,541
He's evil.

205
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,625
Priority has changed.
Priority has changed.

206
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,583
Allen Walker's injury
takes precedence

207
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,541
over manliness
increase operation.

208
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,208
How... dare you.

209
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:02,875
He gassed her!
He gassed Lenalee!

210
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:03,833
She'll be okay, guys.

211
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,916
I have a great view from here.

212
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,666
Thanks a lot, 65.

213
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,208
Now I must capture Allen Walker.

214
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,833
Expecting resistence...

215
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,750
Lock on.

216
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:18,958
Allen!

217
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:19,875
Just run!

218
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,333
But where should I go?!

219
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,208
It doesn't matter...!

220
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,833
Get outta the way kid!

221
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,541
Oh... Right!

222
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,125
Pursue the target at all costs.

223
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,583
He must be caught.

224
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,458
It is for his own good.

225
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,291
Aww, man...

226
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,375
Lenalee... Lenalee...!

227
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,916
Lenalee, snap out of it!

228
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,375
Come on, sis.

229
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,083
Why won't she
answer me?! Why??!!!

230
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,041
It's not looking good for Allen.

231
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,666
That's a safe assessment.

232
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,791
I wouldn't worry.

233
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:02,875
His battery doesn't
have a full charge

234
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,541
so he should be
out of juice soon.

235
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,500
Unless he used those
extended batteries

236
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,041
we've been working on.

237
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,958
Even though Allen has the
powers of an Exorcist,

238
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,458
he's still only
flesh and blood.

239
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,416
Poor guy's probably on
an empty stomach, too.

240
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:18,500
Listen up, everyone.

241
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:19,583
We need to stop this nonsense

242
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,208
before it gets
anymore out of hand...

243
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,750
The Order doesn't
like to pay overtime

244
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,458
but they also wouldn't hesitate
to cut all of our salaries.

245
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:26,166
Ouch.

246
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,291
Now that's evil.

247
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,791
If you don't want
that to happen then

248
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,416
we need to stop that thing
immediately and save Allen...

249
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,291
Are you ready?

250
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,625
Yes, sir!

251
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,083
Russell's on recon...

252
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,041
Number Sixty-Five,
you're Allen's guide...

253
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,583
The rest of you,
wait for instructions.

254
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,083
Roger that, sir!

255
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,666
Section Leader Reever,

256
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,000
I have a really good idea for a
rescue plan that we could use.

257
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:45,833
Yeah...?

258
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,333
Let's hear it.

259
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,958
I like to call it the
"Tears of Sadness

260
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,291
become a Waterfall of Hope"
hostage rescue mission.

261
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,041
I meant the details of the plan.

262
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,000
We'll just catch
him with this rope.

263
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,833
Rope catching...?

264
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,875
Please sir, just try
to have an open mind...

265
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,916
Sometimes in science we have to
resort to primitive techniques.

266
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,791
Well I guess it's worth a shot.

267
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,000
Here goes!

268
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,916
That didn't work at all!!!

269
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,916
That was a world
record at failure.

270
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,500
The target is moving west

271
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,916
in the northeast quadrant
at thirty kilometers an hour.

272
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,291
Yeah...

273
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,708
This is the perfect
opportunity to launch my plan.

274
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:29,833
Let's hear it Johnny.

275
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,958
I just hope it's
better than Tap's.

276
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:33,833
And...

277
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,291
POW!

278
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,000
Another robot?!

279
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,791
I don't understand
why it's holding a broom.

280
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,166
It looks like one of
those cleaner thingy's

281
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,416
that you use to
vacuum the floor with.

282
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,666
Johnny...

283
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,333
There better be a good
explanation for this.

284
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,583
Actually it's something
I've been cooking up

285
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,541
in my head for years for
just a situation like this.

286
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,625
It's a new bot for the lab!

287
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,000
It not only sweeps,

288
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,541
but it also holds
the potential ability

289
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,916
to slay even the
most powerful Akuma!

290
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,958
It's the ultimate weapon!

291
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,791
Go... get 'em!

292
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:17,916
No, no, no.
You've got to be kidding me!

293
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,333
Not another robot...!

294
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,416
Wait a minute.

295
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,125
Is that a vacuum cleaner
attached to it?

296
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:22,833
Allen!

297
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,458
Get to the storage room!

298
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,833
Where's that?

299
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,875
It's this way Allen!

300
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,250
Just follow me!

301
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,041
Okay I'm coming!

302
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,208
Hurry!

303
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,500
Are you sure that
thing can handle itself?

304
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:49,916
Okay...

305
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,791
I made it inside the
storage room, Johnny.

306
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:52,875
Good job, Allen.

307
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,583
Now you just
leave the rest to me.

308
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,625
Thank, God.

309
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,000
Ah great!

310
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,375
It's cleaning the floor now!

311
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,875
You're kidding me...!

312
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,541
It's programmed so well, it
won't ignore the tiniest bit

313
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,833
of dust--even
in times of crisis!

314
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:08,791
It didn't work.

315
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,291
Why am I not surprised...?

316
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,125
This is Reever.

317
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,375
Are you guys ready?

318
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,458
Yes we are, sir!

319
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,791
Stand by...

320
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,208
Allen, you'll have to head
over to the main hall,

321
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,541
we'll try to mount
a rescue from there.

322
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:31,875
Stop running.

323
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,708
I am only trying to
treat your injuries.

324
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,291
Then tell me why you're trying
to kill me with those missiles?!

325
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,375
Don't panic Allen...

326
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,750
C'mon...

327
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:42,875
This way.

328
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,000
Thanks!

329
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,208
Okay, I'm here!

330
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,083
Where are you guys?

331
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,541
Allen, you made it!

332
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,250
Oh, hey everyone.

333
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,250
Sorry about the wait.

334
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,041
We'll get you to
safety this time.

335
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,541
It's almost here.

336
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,833
Johnny... Do it!

337
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,000
Yes, sir, right away!

338
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,000
Energy replenishment complete!

339
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:18,791
Distance two-hundred.

340
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,041
Firing angle is set.

341
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,208
Never underestimate a geek...!

342
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,958
Cause we know how
to bring the pain!

343
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,625
Yeah!

344
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,625
Don't shoot Sir Komlin!!!

345
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,458
Don't shoot my baby!

346
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,125
He's all I have!!!

347
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,375
Chief, let go! I can't breathe!

348
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,208
Don't you care at all
what happens to Allen?!

349
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,416
Don't blame my
baby for everything!!!

350
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,291
CHIEF!!!

351
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,166
Ahh!! The Chief is a traitor!!

352
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,458
What do you guys
expect me to do?!

353
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,708
What's all the fuss about?

354
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,166
Kanda...?! I'll
explain it later...

355
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,083
But we need to stop this robot.

356
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,958
It would be a lot easier if
we knew what its weakness was.

357
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,416
Only an amateur wouldn't be
able to see its weak spot.

358
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,541
Huh?

359
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:19,708
I had the joy of destroying

360
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,250
a very similar robot
to this in the past.

361
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:24,666
So where's its weak point?

362
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,708
Just tell me!

363
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,625
Hit it in the scruff, kid.

364
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:28,916
In its scruff...

365
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,875
Got it...

366
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:30,583
Wait...!

367
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:31,541
What the heck's scruff?

368
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,250
Well that's a shame isn't it...?

369
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,750
I guess it's your
fate to die, huh?

370
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,375
No...!

371
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,041
You think you're funny,
don't ya, Kanda?!

372
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,750
It's sneaking up
from behind you...!

373
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:40,416
Allen!

374
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,666
Watch your back!

375
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,291
Crap!

376
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,833
Allen Walker
has been captured...

377
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,458
Proceed to operating
room immediately.

378
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:52,541
Allen!

379
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,125
Shaving, carving, gashing, cuts.

380
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,250
We just want to spill some guts!

381
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,041
I have no other choice...

382
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,083
Innocence...

383
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,500
Activate!

384
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:02,833
Oh wow!

385
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,458
Is that the new
Anti-Akuma Weapon?!

386
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,666
What the hell was that for?!!

387
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,416
My body feels
like butterflies...

388
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,708
He shot a blowgun at Allen!

389
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:14,958
But if he uses his weapon

390
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,291
on Sir Komlin the
Second he'll hurt him...!

391
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,625
I can't move...

392
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,291
I think I'm paralyzed.

393
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,291
No!

394
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,375
Fight it boy!

395
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:32,791
Innocence...

396
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:33,875
Activate.

397
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:17,541
What about Allen?

398
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:18,416
Can you see him?

399
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,041
Allen.

400
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,083
You okay?

401
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:20,750
Yeah...

402
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,000
Never been better.

403
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,708
Take my hand.

404
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,833
I'm glad you're alright...

405
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,458
I thought we had lost
our newest member

406
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,083
to Komui's latest
scientific debacle...

407
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,833
That was a close one.

408
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,458
All this over a useless robot.

409
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,375
Sir Komlin the Second sucks!

410
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,208
We should melt it down!

411
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,375
Melt it down! Melt it down!
Melt it down! Melt it down!

412
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,000
It's not Sir Komlin's fault...!

413
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,583
It's all because of the coffee!

414
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,583
You should condemn the
coffee, not the offender...!

415
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,083
Have some compassion...

416
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,125
He's just a little boy.

417
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,208
Brother.

418
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:58,208
Lenalee! You've got to
stop these monsters!

419
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:01,083
Go to your room and think
about what you've done.

420
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm really sorry
about all this, Allen.

421
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:09,875
It's fine.

422
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,291
The Chief's really a good man...

423
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,625
He had great intentions

424
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:15,208
by building that robot
to treat Exorcists,

425
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,291
but it always seems
to get out of hand.

426
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,333
Or is a complete failure.

427
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,083
Right about that...

428
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:25,541
I'm just relieved that
no one was seriously hurt.

429
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:26,791
Now that that's over,

430
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,083
would you mind
joining me again, Allen?

431
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:40,125
It's for you.

432
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,250
Me?

433
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,333
You really thought
we'd let you join us

434
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,750
without a welcoming party?

435
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,041
Everyone was up
all night gettin ready!

436
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,833
That's why I was
acting weird today.

437
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,750
I didn't want to
spoil the surprise...

438
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:50,583
Here...

439
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,833
Your very own coffee mug.

440
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,750
Welcome to the family Allen...

441
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:55,791
You're with us now...

442
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,041
Cheers.

443
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,416
We're so glad to have you Allen.

444
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:08,000
Welcome back... son.

445
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,083
It's good to be back.

446
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,750
I can't stand plain food.

447
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,875
You stupid pile of junk...!

448
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,000
I told you to make it sweet!

449
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,916
Please Skin, have some courtesy.

450
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,458
Can't the beatings
wait until after our meal?

451
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,541
I'm leaving...

452
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,833
I refuse to eat that drivel.

453
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,208
Have it your way...

454
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,916
You can't even
pretend to like it...

455
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,208
how uncultured.

456
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,958
Take it easy, Tyki...

457
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,333
Let's keep things civil.

458
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,583
We're trying to have
a nice family dinner.

459
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,750
Isn't that right...
Lord Millennium...?

460
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,833
So I was thinking maybe
you could set the mood

461
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,125
for the rest of the evening

462
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,708
by telling us exactly
why we're here.

463
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,791
Unless I'm mistaken...

464
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,750
it's time for us
to start the party...

465
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,916
There exists a village
where the same day

466
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,875
is repeated over
and over again...

467
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:47,375
It is in this place where
I encounter the woman Miranda.

468
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,541
On the next episode
of D. Gray-man:

469
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,125
"The Rewinding Town."

470
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:55,625
Bring forth salvation to this
tormented Akuma's soul.
