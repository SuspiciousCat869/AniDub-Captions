1
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:45,125
What are you so
depressed for, Krory...?

2
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:47,458
Cheer up.

3
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:48,916
We did our best, okay...

4
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,375
No matter how I tried to
explain the situation to 'em,

5
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:53,625
the villagers didn't wanna
believe a word I said...

6
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:55,083
Yeah but...

7
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:00,125
So Krory was hunting
Akuma whenever

8
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:02,041
he would attack our village...?

9
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:04,333
Do you expect us
to believe that story?

10
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,875
It's heresy!

11
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,291
And it still doesn't change
the fact that he's a monster!

12
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,875
Leave our village at once!

13
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:12,958
You'll never be
welcome here again!

14
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:14,208
Leave monster!

15
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:15,291
Get out of here you freak!

16
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,458
Good riddance to ya!!

17
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:19,333
You're all monsters!

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,500
I was a bit offended, I mean
we helped those people.

19
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,750
Ah, who cares if
we can't go back...?

20
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,666
The only home a man should
ever need is within his heart.

21
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,375
Geez, talk about snobby.

22
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:34,916
Lavi! Hold me...

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,916
Ahh, get off me!

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,166
I'm not much of
a cuddler, Krory!

25
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,416
Come on, you're starting
to creep me out man...

26
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,625
Get off...

27
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:41,791
Stop it, stop!

28
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:42,625
I'm serious man...

29
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,375
Get your hands off me!

30
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,666
This is too much...

31
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,416
Wow, so this is what
a town looks like.

32
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,958
Have you never been here before?

33
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,291
Well of course not.

34
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,625
I've lived in that castle
my entire life... sorry.

35
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,625
We got a little time
before the train leaves...

36
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,541
Why don't you have
a look around town?

37
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:00,750
You're right...

38
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,750
It... should be good for me...

39
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,250
I'll find you later.

40
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,416
Great, have fun!

41
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,208
Wow, he's totally different ever

42
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,875
since his Innocence
was activated.

43
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,583
Woah...

44
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,708
What a fantastic piece of art!

45
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,916
Your taste is impeccable, sir!

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,041
This item is an
Enchantment Mask...

47
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,416
It was used by the royal family

48
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,458
over three-thousand
years ago...!

49
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,375
I have it on hold but
I could sell it to you...

50
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:29,791
Hmm, three-thousand
years old, you say?

51
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,625
His taste needs some work.

52
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,125
Oh by the way Lavi...

53
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,916
Are you sure it was okay for
us to leave without Bookman?

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,750
It's fine...

55
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:38,958
He said he'd make
his way back to

56
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:42,166
the Black Order once
he sent in his report.

57
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,041
No... No sir...

58
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,000
Thank you!

59
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,000
Look guys...

60
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,125
I got some great
deals back there.

61
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,791
If you can call it that.

62
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,791
I'm sorry, Krory,
but this is a fake.

63
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:55,500
A fake?

64
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:56,875
That can't be true...!

65
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,416
That salesman
told me it was worn

66
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,333
by royalty over
three-thousand years ago

67
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,666
and it's their only remaining...

68
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,458
Hey!

69
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,666
Big hammer,
little hammer, extend!

70
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:14,708
I'm so sorry sir!

71
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,666
Here's a full refund!

72
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,291
Come back again
sometime, we'll ah...

73
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,500
That snake.

74
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,333
You need to be more
careful now, Krory...

75
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:25,916
There are people in this world
who will take advantage of you.

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,458
Oh, thank you Allen.

77
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,791
Krory has got a lot to learn.

78
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,208
Better get some
street smarts fast...

79
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,458
Wanna buy this book?

80
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,583
Reading it will bring
you eternal happiness.

81
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,041
Oh, yes I would!

82
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,666
Krory!

83
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,375
So this is a train...?

84
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,458
I've never been so excited...!

85
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,708
I can't wait to
explore the world!

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,750
Krory, where are you?!

87
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,541
This train isn't
even that big...

88
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:04,750
What the heck do you suppose

89
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,208
he's been doing for
the past three hours?

90
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,541
How can he get
lost when there's only

91
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,833
really one way to go?

92
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,750
Krory!

93
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,125
Hey.

94
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,875
Who are you...?

95
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:25,583
No kids are allowed inside here.
This is a private cabin...

96
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:26,791
Now my friend...

97
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,750
Are you ready for another hand?

98
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:29,500
Umm...

99
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:30,958
No thank you sir...

100
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,458
I'm not...

101
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,416
So, Krory...

102
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,625
Having fun?

103
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:35,791
Well...

104
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:36,583
These men asked if
I'd like to play a game

105
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,333
called poker with them...

106
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:41,541
As you can see it
hasn't been going so well.

107
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,000
Ahh... He's been tricked again.

108
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,375
Come on, you owe
us one more hand.

109
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,666
You already agreed to play us...

110
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,375
If you're a real player you'll
see it through to the very end.

111
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,208
Uh... yeah but...

112
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,708
Go ahead and take
a look at my coat...

113
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,208
The buttons are
made of silver...

114
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,791
If you let me use
it as collateral

115
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,125
I'll play some hands with you...

116
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,666
If I win I get his stuff back.

117
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,875
Allen, hold up...

118
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,458
You sure about this?

119
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,875
Deal.

120
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,583
I call.

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,166
A freaking royal
straight flush...?

122
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,458
Gimme a break!

123
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,041
I guess that means I win again.

124
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:24,833
Ahh...

125
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,041
Screw this game!

126
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,583
How's he winning...?

127
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,041
I was careful this time and
dealt him all the crappy cards.

128
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,208
This kid's playing
us like fools.

129
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,041
This ain't no ordinary kid...

130
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,291
He's a poker master.

131
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,458
It's amazing!

132
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,458
Piece of cake...
Piece of cake...

133
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:41,166
Damn it kid.

134
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,208
One more hand!

135
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,375
I don't have a
problem with that...

136
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,708
Just make sure you
wash your underwear

137
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,541
before you hand it over, okay?

138
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,875
Oh Allen... you're great!

139
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,125
What's up Allen...?

140
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,333
Aren't you a little too
good at this game...?

141
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,541
I always thought
you had rotten luck.

142
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,291
It's because I'm cheating.

143
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,875
Wait... You serious...?
That's surprising.

144
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,250
I don't feel bad about it.

145
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,083
They're the ones who
started it by scamming Krory.

146
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:10,250
I never lose in a card game.

147
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:11,708
Hey maggot!

148
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,250
Where's Cross?!

149
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,416
So you're his apprentice...

150
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,750
Then you can pay
his debts for him!

151
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,083
When I was training
with Master Cross,

152
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,416
I had to hone my skills
in whatever way possible

153
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,875
in order to pay off his debts
and earn a living for myself.

154
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,041
Your skills?

155
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,416
Winning is everything
in gambling...

156
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,916
Show no mercy...

157
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,875
Since these three thugs
are working together,

158
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,291
I find this to be an even match.

159
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,791
This must be his dark side...

160
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,958
I wonder what his life was like

161
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,125
when he was training as a kid.

162
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,000
Call...

163
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,291
Four of a kind.

164
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,916
What the hell?!

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,791
So dark...

166
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:51,125
We have arrived at
Berg Mine Station...

167
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,666
Berg Mine Station.

168
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,166
Here.

169
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,000
Since I won back all of
my friend's belongings,

170
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,666
I no longer need these...

171
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,791
You might want to
put on some clothing

172
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,291
in this cold weather.

173
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,500
Look kid...

174
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,833
You can think you're a big shot

175
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,666
'cause you won but we
never asked for your pity.

176
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:08,500
Then explain this.

177
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:11,125
Oh, yeah...

178
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,458
You're a lifesaver, kid!

179
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:15,208
I was about five minutes
away from frostbite!

180
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:21,708
Here, catch!

181
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
They're yours...!

182
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,250
Consider it a token
of my thanks!

183
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,791
Will do!

184
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,291
Who would have
thought a kid dressed up

185
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,666
that nice would be
such a heartless cheat?

186
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,166
He was a pro, he had
us conned all the way...

187
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,625
Tyki... Eeze, we should go...

188
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:45,875
If we hurry we can
meet the factory owner

189
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,500
and get some free food
out of him again, yeah?

190
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,000
Sounds good.

191
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,708
Hey guys...!

192
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,625
I'll have to take a
rain check on that food.

193
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,666
What...?

194
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,583
Do you have
another secret job...?

195
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,541
I was hoping you'd
be done with those.

196
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,000
Well I guess it's your loss...

197
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,041
Just means more food for us.

198
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,500
Sorry.

199
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,041
Would you like a flower, mister?

200
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,458
They're pretty and
smell good too.

201
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,916
Uhh... No thank you dear.

202
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,458
In truth I would love to,

203
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:28,791
but Allen and Lavi told me not
to waste my money any more.

204
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,291
No, don't cry sweetheart.

205
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,708
Please... Please don't cry!

206
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,000
Mind if I get some grub
in me before we start this?

207
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,750
I have no problems with that.

208
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,708
Good, cause I could eat
my own foot at this point.

209
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,833
Just put on something nicer
than those rags you have on...

210
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,250
No one will ever let you into

211
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,750
a five-star restaurant
dressed like a hobo.

212
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,166
I suppose you speak

213
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,958
from experience
judging by your weight.

214
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,625
I am not overweight.

215
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,083
Well...

216
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,666
I'm so hungry even a pig's
feed bag would work for me.

217
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,750
If I were you I'd start choosing
my words more carefully.

218
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,500
Got it, Sir Tyki Mikk?

219
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,083
Alright.

220
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,375
As you wish, Lord Millennium.

221
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,333
Krory, come on!

222
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,375
Do you think he
might be lost again?

223
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,958
Oh geez...

224
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,416
You lost them again?

225
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,250
Huh...?

226
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,083
No, it's not like that...

227
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,750
I came up with this on my own.

228
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,166
Honestly...

229
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,375
A little girl told me about how
she's selling flowers to

230
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,500
help care for her ten-thousand
year old grandfather

231
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,083
and her two-thousand
brothers she has

232
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,208
to help her parents support.

233
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:00,458
It was incredibly moving.
I had to help her.

234
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,541
Krory, you're too
nice for this world.

235
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,125
This is my new curse.

236
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,666
Wait...

237
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,333
No human grandfather can
live for ten-thousand years.

238
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,250
I've been tricked again.

239
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,416
I can't do anything
on my own now.

240
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,500
All those years in the
castle have paid their toll.

241
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,958
How will I survive?

242
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,375
We've finally made
it to the Black Order.

243
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,250
Hey are you okay?

244
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,583
He's still thinking
about the train ride...

245
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,833
Once we get him
inside he'll feel better.

246
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,750
Halt!!!

247
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,291
Prepare for the X-Ray Exam.

248
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:45,916
What is this light for?

249
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,916
What is it doing?

250
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,458
It's just a quick test...

251
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,708
He scans your body

252
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:52,208
and decides whether or
not you're an Akuma...

253
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,166
It's just a precaution.

254
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:58,958
Failure...

255
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:02,500
Failure!!...! A pentacle
is a sign of an Akuma!

256
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,500
He must be one of the
Millennium Earl's henchman!

257
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,500
Huh?!

258
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:10,625
Akuma Alert!

259
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,375
Hey Allen...

260
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,958
What'd the alarm go off for?

261
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,333
I don't understand
how this could happen...

262
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,375
It's possible the blood he took

263
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,208
from Eliade is
still in his system...

264
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,125
That could be what's
causing the alarm.

265
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,250
My poor Eliade.

266
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,583
Dispose of the Akuma!

267
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,166
What is that?

268
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,291
Sir Komlin!

269
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,791
The fourth!

270
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:50,958
I souped up his circuits

271
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,416
and even built an
Akuma detector to boot!

272
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,041
The moment it detects an Akuma

273
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,416
it rushes to the
scene to squash it!

274
00:12:58,916 --> 00:12:59,875
What the heck...?

275
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,916
He's so obsessed
with Sir Komlin...?

276
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,625
I'll handle this...

277
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,875
Hey...! Use your eyes, brother!

278
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,750
Allen and Lavi brought
him here themselves!

279
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:09,875
Huh?

280
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,250
Hey Komui.

281
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,791
Yes of course...

282
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,125
This is the Akuma vampire you
spoke to me about, isn't it?

283
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,916
Introducing Arystar Krory.

284
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,458
Whoopsie...

285
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:21,583
It would have been
in your best interests

286
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:22,916
to tell me this earlier.

287
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,416
Target confirmed.

288
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,291
Huh?

289
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,833
Once Sir Komlin the
Fourth has acquired

290
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,208
a target he will not cease
until it's dead and gone!

291
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,541
Wha...?!

292
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,500
Sir Komlin the
Fourth, go forth...!

293
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,458
Defeat the enemy!

294
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:39,916
Oh great...

295
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,375
He always acts like this
after pulling an all-nighter.

296
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,041
I'm so embarrassed.

297
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:49,916
What is that thing?

298
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,416
It's so scary!

299
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,333
That's it Komui...

300
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,000
Take this!

301
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,333
Allen...

302
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,958
I've been researching you...
and your techniques...

303
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,666
Let's see if you
can handle... this!

304
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:09,791
Cooking?

305
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:16,833
Believe it or not,

306
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,000
Sir Komlin the
Fourth's cooking skills

307
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,333
are on a level so
elite you'll salivate!

308
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:21,583
Wait, I don't get it.

309
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:22,875
Watch this!

310
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,125
Big hammer, little hammer...

311
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,833
Grow... Grow... Grow!

312
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,750
Wok... Wok... Wok!

313
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,583
Oww... That's not fair...!

314
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,375
Are you crazy?!

315
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,250
And today Chef
Komlin suggests...

316
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,875
Mediterranean omelet
with veggies and Lavi!

317
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,291
You are out of your mind!

318
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,458
Now Sir Komlin the Fourth...

319
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,500
On to the next dish!

320
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,000
Let's add a pinch... of... salt.

321
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,958
All-spice seasoning... attack!!

322
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,250
The salt! It tastes horrible!

323
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:09,125
Don't forget to add the oil!

324
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,416
How should we prepare them?

325
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,750
Boiled, sautéed
or deep-fried...?

326
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,958
Or perhaps we could
try a bouillabaisse...

327
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:29,791
Alright...

328
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,791
This ends right now...

329
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,750
Waltz Misty...

330
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,416
Wind!

331
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,583
You should be ashamed...

332
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:46,875
Mister Krory...

333
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,250
Let me apologize for
my brother's misgivings...

334
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,250
He can get carried
away sometimes.

335
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,958
I don't know if I'm going
to like the Black Order.

336
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,000
Let me get this straight.

337
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,583
You're saying it was
Krory, and not Cross,

338
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,541
who was living in the
castle the whole time?

339
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,000
That's right.

340
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,625
Cross did visit the castle
but it was for a short time.

341
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:08,625
Dear Heavens, where
in the world is Cross?

342
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,375
Though he's still missing we did

343
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,375
find Krory so the operation
wasn't a total loss.

344
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,333
And by the way.

345
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,166
Huh?

346
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,916
What are you planning
to do with me?

347
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,500
You will know...

348
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,500
Soon enough!

349
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,625
Now...

350
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,875
That sounds pleasant...

351
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,500
Well this brings back memories.

352
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,333
He did the same thing
to me when I got here.

353
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,208
That's quite the weapon
you're sporting there.

354
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,708
I noticed you had some cavities

355
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,333
so I went ahead and
filled those for you.

356
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,791
Hevlaska...

357
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:04,791
So what do you think?
Does he have what it takes?

358
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:09,208
If I were in his shoes
I'd be scared too.

359
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,833
I think that poor guy's
still got a lot to learn.

360
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,333
I remember when I saw
Hevlaska for the first time.

361
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,583
It was tough on me too.

362
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,916
I'm starting to wonder...

363
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,375
if I can live a normal
life in a place like this.

364
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,541
Your room is at the
end of this hall...

365
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,791
I put a sign on
the door for you...

366
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,583
You alright Krory?

367
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:49,791
You look a little pale.

368
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,000
What?

369
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,791
We're glad you could
make it to your party.

370
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,125
Everyone pitched in
to help set this up.

371
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,291
All this for me?

372
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,375
Komlin!

373
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,833
Chief...

374
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,791
Are you sure we can be in
the same room as that thing?

375
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,291
There's nothing
to worry about...

376
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,708
I rebuilt Sir Komlin the
Fourth to be a cleaning bot...

377
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,708
See? It's awesome!

378
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,916
Trash... to be cleaned... Done.

379
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,750
Here...

380
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,375
A custom mug just for you.

381
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,041
Thank you Miss Lenalee.

382
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,333
It's an herbal tea...

383
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,833
It's made with a
special formula...

384
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,291
that's designed
to help us relax.

385
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,000
Thank you.

386
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,250
Well of course...
your family now

387
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,208
and we're all happy that
you're staying with us.

388
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,666
Welcome home, Krory.

389
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,625
Welcome home.

390
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,166
Now, you're one of us here!

391
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:44,416
Uh... It's... good to be home!

392
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,791
Come on now...

393
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,916
Let's all hope these
are happy tears.

394
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,958
No, they are.

395
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,125
I've never been
happier in my life.

396
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,083
Watch the snot!

397
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,375
We all gained a
new friend today...

398
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,250
a new member of our family.

399
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:04,708
Three cheers for the Order's
newest member, Arystar Krory...!

400
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,125
Hip hip hooray!

401
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,791
Here's to Krory!

402
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,666
Oh... I'm so sorry!

403
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,791
You sure that bot's okay?

404
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,958
Of course I'm sure...

405
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,375
Sir Komlin Mini...

406
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,041
Beautify this place.

407
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,375
Beautify... Will do!

408
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,333
Beautification complete!

409
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,333
Well?

410
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,083
Oh wow...

411
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,583
Everyone is dirty.

412
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,291
You need to be beautified!

413
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,500
Enough already...

414
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,250
Take a hike!!

415
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,416
Okay everyone...

416
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,416
We're safe...

417
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:00,000
Oh... A thing of beauty.

418
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,916
I'm surrounded by morons...

419
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,541
Lero.

420
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,208
Well I'm stuffed and happy...

421
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,166
How about some dessert everyone?

422
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,083
Ooo!

423
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,000
I Lero want to eat too Lero!

424
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,250
Lord Millennium...

425
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,291
Surely you didn't gather
us all here for dinner.

426
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,583
Is there something
you'd like to tell us?

427
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,083
We are on a journey to change

428
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,958
the course of this entire
world as we know it,

429
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:56,291
which is why it's time for us
to start a brand new chapter...

430
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,583
Finally, you can
show yourselves...

431
00:20:58,666 --> 00:20:59,791
And trust me...

432
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,625
This is where things
will start to get fun.

433
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,791
Kevin Yeegar...

434
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:41,750
A General from
the Black Order...

435
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:44,083
He was involved in
an incident years ago

436
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:47,250
that continues to bind
his heart to this very day.

437
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:52,125
Next time on D. Grayman:
"The General's Chains."

438
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:55,583
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul.
