1
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm surprised
you don't know this.

2
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,583
Timcanpy has a built-in feature

3
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,875
where he can locate his
creator's whereabouts,

4
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:45,958
no matter where
he is in the world.

5
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:47,041
What?

6
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:50,458
Now then... find Cross
for us Timcanpy.

7
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:57,625
Look he stopped.

8
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,958
Yeah... He's pointing
towards the east.

9
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,458
Oh my gosh, are you alright?

10
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:23,541
Yeah...

11
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,291
I just took a
wrong step, that's all.

12
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,208
Ow, my head.

13
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,416
How much further
is it, Timcanpy?

14
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,541
Much longer than I had hoped.

15
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,291
We're already in Bulgaria...

16
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:42,541
Just a little further and
we'll leave Europe entirely.

17
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,666
Which probably means Master
isn't even in Europe, huh?

18
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,541
'Fraid not...

19
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,375
It's looking like Asia.

20
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,375
Amazing.

21
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,250
It's beautiful.

22
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,250
I've heard that this area
is famous around the world

23
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,666
for its rose fields.

24
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,916
I'll bet.

25
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,875
An Akuma...!
Come on... Let's go...

26
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:15,458
Okay!

27
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:16,541
Let's move!

28
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:29,625
Hey, Allen...!

29
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,500
I'll take this one myself!

30
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,041
I'll cover you!

31
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,125
Sir, are you okay?

32
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,875
You're not injured, are you?

33
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:47,583
Oh, uh, I ah, uh...

34
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,125
I was heading to
Rose Valley in Kazanluk,

35
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,750
when I ran into two travelers

36
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,958
and before I knew it,
we were talking.

37
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,458
I asked them if they were going

38
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,416
to the Rose Festival like
myself, when all of a sudden...

39
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,625
Well you're safe now.

40
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:12,416
Excuse me...

41
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,291
What's the Rose Festival?

42
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,708
Oh...

43
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,958
The Festival starts
today in Rose Valley,

44
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,500
which isn't too much further
down the road from here...

45
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,875
I'll be there selling
my own roses...

46
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,083
Oh right!

47
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,833
This is the very least I can do

48
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,541
to thank the two of you for
saving my life back there.

49
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,666
Oh wow, thank you very much...

50
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,333
I love that smell.

51
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,916
I would never have guessed
there'd be so many people here.

52
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,791
Lavi... and Krory!

53
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,958
Hey!

54
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,791
So far a total of one-hundred

55
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:24,000
and forty-eight casualties
have been confirmed.

56
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,333
Then aside from
the deaths in Spain...

57
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,958
So many gone in
such a short time.

58
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:38,416
The chapel in the Order...
was filled with coffins.

59
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:57,041
And then... they burned
them in a mass cremation.

60
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,875
This was all done without
notifying their families,

61
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,750
to protect them
from becoming Akuma.

62
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,875
That about sums up
the current situation.

63
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,791
One hundred and
forty-eight people...

64
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:13,625
I'm Devon... The leader
of this group...

65
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,416
Oh, Lenalee.

66
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,875
They were all part of my family.

67
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,833
Lavi and I were
sent to find you two

68
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,583
and join you in your quest
to locate General Cross...

69
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,000
Hopefully the
four of us together

70
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,916
will be enough protection.

71
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,333
You guys ready to go?

72
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,625
Where exactly?

73
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,208
Rose festival...

74
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,375
Let's get out of here.

75
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,000
You two could really
use some fresh air.

76
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:15,750
Sorry... but Lenalee and
I aren't in the mood right now.

77
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:16,791
Allen...

78
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,500
You can't let
that bring you down.

79
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:21,125
Have you forgotten about
the situation we're in...?

80
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,500
No matter what we've
got a job to do...

81
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:24,416
Right...

82
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,333
Akuma!

83
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,250
Akuma have been
targeting large groups

84
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,750
lately in an effort to survive.

85
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,916
Such a large batch of
people in this valley

86
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,833
is a perfect breeding ground.

87
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,875
You're right and
that's the main reason

88
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,625
Komui sent us out here
to join up with you two.

89
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:43,500
Plus... he ordered us to go
and check out the festival.

90
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,875
It'll be fun... yeah...

91
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:07,041
More than anything, those two
could use a little relaxation.

92
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,875
My buddy lost three
donkey's in them mountains.

93
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:31,750
Krory...

94
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,125
Did you find
something interesting?

95
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,083
No, you wouldn't!

96
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,166
Look it's their
homemade rose jam...

97
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,000
It tastes great
and for some reason

98
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,458
brings back memories to me.

99
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,041
It's bringing back
memories for me too...

100
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:51,875
So Lavi, I've been thinking.

101
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,333
All that stuff
you told us earlier,

102
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,958
how'd you find out about it...?

103
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,833
You and Krory didn't
actually come straight

104
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,750
from headquarters all
this way, did you...

105
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,000
It was amazing!

106
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:04,833
He used a series of golems
and telephones at the same time.

107
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,583
And then he listened
to the different reports

108
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,333
from the Order and each unit.

109
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,583
You could take all that
information at once?

110
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,208
Who do you think
you're talking to...

111
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,666
I don't see how it's possible.

112
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,000
Apparently it comes
from a technique

113
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,458
invented by an ancient
prince from the Orient.

114
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:19,541
The old panda gave me

115
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,583
some intensive
training on the subject.

116
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,791
So I take it you need to learn
that to become a bookman...?

117
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,708
What an annoying requirement.

118
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,166
Speaking of, I haven't
seen Bookman lately.

119
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,000
Where is he?

120
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,291
Ah... he had some business

121
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,000
to take care of so
he ran off on his own.

122
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,583
They're beautiful.

123
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,458
Gorgeous.

124
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,541
One thing concerns me though...

125
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,666
A total of six exorcists
were assassinated

126
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,291
in the last set of attacks...
and among them...

127
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,041
...several victims were killed

128
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:58,583
in a similar fashion
as General Yeegar.

129
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,708
No scars were
found on their bodies,

130
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,416
yet one of their
organs had been removed.

131
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
How is that possible?

132
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,416
I've never heard of an Akuma

133
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,541
being capable of committing
such a horrendous act...

134
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:12,875
But we know there are people

135
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,291
in this world with
abnormal powers.

136
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,750
People with abnormal powers...?

137
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,375
Would you be referring
to the Clan of Noah?

138
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:21,375
Yep...

139
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,708
You got it.

140
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:26,291
Do we know anything
about this clan?

141
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,083
No, not too much...

142
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,333
The only thing we're sure
of is that their existence

143
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,083
is rooted deep within history

144
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,333
and they're
completely untraceable.

145
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,375
Although they often appeared
at turning points in history,

146
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:42,666
they're never mentioned
literature or records.

147
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,333
However the bookmen

148
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,125
who record the secret
history of the world,

149
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,750
have become aware
of their existence

150
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,666
but nothing beyond that...

151
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,791
And that's all we know.

152
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:54,916
We are the chosen ones,

153
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,958
the true Apostles that were
hand-picked by God himself...

154
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:01,333
I am Road and I am
in the Clan of Noah.

155
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,916
They claim to be Apostles chosen

156
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,291
by God yet their actions are
evil incarnate to the core...

157
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,291
What does all of
this mean, Lavi?

158
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:09,375
Don't know...

159
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,541
...but you gotta
remember in this world

160
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,125
everyone thinks
their way is right.

161
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:22,708
Lero!

162
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,208
Stop it, it hurts Lero!

163
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,458
What did I do to
deserve this, lero, lero?!

164
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,458
Ugh, I am so incredibly bored.

165
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:30,500
Let go of me, Lero!

166
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,041
I said right now!

167
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:36,625
Lord, please save me
from her torment!

168
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,541
We still have a ways to go.

169
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,208
What are you
talking about, lero?

170
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,750
I'm speaking about Exorcists.

171
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,208
But Lero, we launched
a major offensive

172
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,500
and killed scores of
Black Order members, lero...!

173
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,791
And to make it even sweeter

174
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,375
we got six exorcists too,
lero...! Remember?!

175
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,750
It's just not
that simple Lero...

176
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:58,041
Body counts mean nothing without
the Heart of Innocence...

177
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:01,000
Our entire success
hinges on us finding it.

178
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,250
Uh, hello...

179
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,916
I told you I would find
it if you would let me.

180
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,916
There's no need to be
in such a rush, Road...

181
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,541
Our first step must be to create
more Akuma on a grand scale,

182
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,666
so that they may kill
as many humans as possible

183
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,750
and increase
their power levels...

184
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:18,416
Well that sure does
sound like a lot of fun...

185
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,583
Why yes indeed, fun...

186
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,291
But if that
meddlesome Cross decides

187
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,708
to act it will make our path
to victory more difficult...

188
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,291
What's important
right now is for us

189
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,000
to find the Exorcists
who are searching

190
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,291
for Cross and slow them down.

191
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,833
Okay, I'll do it!

192
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,666
Nah, that won't be necessary,

193
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,083
I've already made arrangements.

194
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,458
No fair!

195
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:05,500
My dear Eliade.

196
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,125
She is so perfect.

197
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,416
Well we didn't run
into any Akuma today...

198
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,000
What a relief...
You awake?

199
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,541
You know...

200
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,500
I've devoted the last
few years of my life

201
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:34,916
to saving as many lives
and souls as possible.

202
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,666
I'm sorry to have to do this...

203
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,416
Your suffering will end
forever in just a moment.

204
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,083
May you rest in peace... Claire.

205
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,875
Thank you.

206
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,416
You helped me keep my promise...

207
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,875
We're not just destroyers...

208
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,875
At the same time
we can be saviors...

209
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,916
Akuma are tragic creatures,

210
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,541
they shouldn't have to
suffer in this existence...

211
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:25,625
And therefore...

212
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,125
I destroy them.

213
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:31,291
Allen, destroy him...!
Destroy Leo!

214
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,291
Cross...

215
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,083
Grave!

216
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,541
But then... there were many
lives that I couldn't save

217
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,750
because I wasn't capable
enough to help them.

218
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,666
Hey Narain...

219
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,291
I brought this... for Meina.

220
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,791
Why thank you Allen...

221
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,333
Thanks a lot.

222
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,875
No... You can't be...

223
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,041
I met Narain in India...

224
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,958
He was a good friend.

225
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,208
General Yeegar.

226
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:33,125
If only we'd been more careful,
kept a closer eye on her!

227
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,916
I'm sorry, Sarah...

228
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,708
If it wasn't for me,

229
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,458
you never would have
turned into an Akuma!

230
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,625
Sarah... a nurse.

231
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:50,916
Oh no!

232
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,375
Allen... Lenalee...

233
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,625
Hello... Is Devon around?

234
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,666
It can't be... No...

235
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,000
We lost Devon
and so many other finders...

236
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,333
If only I'd been more careful.

237
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,875
I wish I would have
pushed myself more...

238
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,083
It's just so frustrating!

239
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,458
Allen... pushing yourself more

240
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,208
probably wouldn't
change anything.

241
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:22,208
Do you really think you can
save everyone all by yourself?

242
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,625
What?

243
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:26,750
This war against the Millennium
Earl is a team effort...

244
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,208
You know that.

245
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,833
Not bad...! Listen up...!

246
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,000
Do whatever those
two tell you, okay...?

247
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,083
Set your barrier
device to capture!

248
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,333
Yes, sir!

249
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,666
Everyone attack!

250
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,333
Thanks for the help, guys!

251
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,458
Don't try to get up yet...

252
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,333
I still haven't forgiven you.

253
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,666
Oh... all right.

254
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,083
You're really selfish, Allen...

255
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,125
You think that being
able to see Akuma's souls

256
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:09,208
means that you carry the
whole burden and you sacrifice

257
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:12,708
yourself instead of
letting other people help.

258
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:16,583
I wonder, what friendship
even means to you...

259
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,125
Because it's insulting...

260
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:21,125
when you won't even allow
me to fight beside you!

261
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,666
I hate... your stupid eye...

262
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,416
I hate it.

263
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,208
Um...

264
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,416
Lenalee, I...

265
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,125
Thank you for saving my life.

266
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,791
You're welcome. I'm sure
it won't be the last time!

267
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,708
Trust me...

268
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,875
Everyone feels the
same way you do.

269
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:49,958
There's not one of us

270
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,458
who doesn't feel
frustrated or sad...

271
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,750
We're all here sharing
the same experiences.

272
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,125
The Finders...

273
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,791
Lenalee.

274
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,708
Do you see...? Allen?

275
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:22,708
What's wrong?

276
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,416
It's that man that
just passed below us.

277
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,291
An Akuma?

278
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:42,833
Okay, you were right.

279
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,291
They're after the Rose
Festival crowd after all.

280
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,458
Seems so.

281
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:49,208
But there's no way
that was all of 'em...

282
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,875
I can see them...

283
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,625
They're still far away but
it looks like a good number

284
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,208
are heading
straight for this valley.

285
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,416
They're here.

286
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,458
Good 'cause we're
ready for them.

287
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,125
Innocence activate...!

288
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,500
Grow... grow... grow!

289
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:25,791
Hellfire... Devouring...
Fire Stamp!

290
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,583
Innocence activate!

291
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,958
Waltz Misty Wind!

292
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,833
Innocence activate!

293
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,250
Of course.

294
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,708
How could I forget my friends
are here to help me?

295
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,416
This is a really large
group of Akuma...

296
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,333
which means a lot of innocent
people lost their lives.

297
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,625
And since there
were so many lives

298
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,666
that never had a
chance to be saved...

299
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,041
We choose to fight!

300
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,791
Bring forth salvation to
these tormented Akuma's souls.

301
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,250
Let's hurry...

302
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,916
We need to find Master Cross...

303
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,916
The sooner we do the
sooner all this will be over.

304
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,125
Well said Allen.

305
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,541
We're right behind ya.

306
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:41,208
Caught in the middle of a
treacherous thunderstorm

307
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:43,208
while looking for Master Cross,

308
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:47,958
we all encounter a mysterious...
yet beautiful woman...

309
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:52,416
On the next episode of
D. Gray-man: "A New Assassin."

310
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,083
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul.
