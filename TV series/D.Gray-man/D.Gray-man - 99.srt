00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:52,541
All right, Lau Jimin. Activate!

00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:57,875
[KLAUD]
Go!

00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,791
You ready to come out and play?

6
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,750
Time for Judgment.

7
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,958
[GIANT AKUMA E]
Exorcists.

8
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:40,958
[laughing]

9
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,708
Not Tup.

10
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,625
[BAK]
Johnny!

11
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,708
Where do you think you're going?
You're in no shape to run.

12
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,416
I'll find you.

13
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:20,083
They're taking him.
They're taking my friend away.

14
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:30,375
[ALLEN] It's faint, but my eye
is reacting to something.

15
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:33,333
Were there Akuma that survived?

16
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,500
The reading's so weak,

17
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,208
I can't tell if it's
just my imagination.

18
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:45,125
[TIEDOLL]
Ugh. What a terrible stench.

19
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,333
[MARIE]
Command center.

20
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:49,583
This is Noise Marie
in Lab 5. Do you copy?

21
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:52,125
We've stopped the Akuma
invasion on Headquarters.

22
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,166
Can that radio
reach the outside?

23
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,333
From what I heard,

24
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,166
Chief's Bak's latest
model should be able

25
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,250
to punch through the
Ark's magnetic field.

26
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,750
Let's see.

27
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:05,000
Command center, do you copy?
Chief Komui. This is Lab 5.

28
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:08,583
[KOMUI] This is command center.
We read you. Go ahead.

29
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,041
What is the condition
of Laboratory 5?

30
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,041
[MARIE] Several dozen
Science Section members

31
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,625
are seriously injured.

32
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:18,125
The dead Akuma are giving off
large amounts of noxious gas.

33
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,916
Breathing conditions and
visibility are limited.

34
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,541
Best you cover your mouth
and protect your lungs.

35
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,250
These fumes are
poisonous to breathe.

36
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,083
We'll turn on the ventilation.

37
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,166
What about the enemy portal?

38
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:38,375
[MARIE] Two gateways remain.
Neither show signs of closing.

39
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,333
Thank you for the report.

40
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:46,333
Standby, Marie. And protect
Miranda, understood?

41
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,750
General Cross. Do you copy?

42
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,416
I read you.

43
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,583
[KOMUI] I'm going to have
Miranda deactivate her power

44
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,916
and return the egg
to normal time.

45
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,416
The hell are you
talking about?

46
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,875
We only have one
option available.

47
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,250
I want you to destroy the egg.

48
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,875
[ROUVELIER]
Don't be brash, Chief Komui.

49
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,666
I can't let you do that.

50
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,125
Are you blind to the
value the egg possesses?

51
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,916
It's too late to save it.

52
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,875
It's already been
transferred to their Ark.

53
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:18,458
The Time Record only turns
time back temporarily.

54
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,791
But it can't erase events
that have already transpired.

55
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,875
Which leaves us
with two choices.

56
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:27,875
Either we destroy it,
or let the Earl have it back.

57
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,333
There's no time to waste.

58
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,333
We've got to evacuate.

59
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:40,083
Get your people to the
highest floor, Reever.

60
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,875
[REEVER] No. I'm fine.
Everyone else, go upstairs.

61
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,458
[MARVIN]
Section Leader?

62
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:45,833
You can't!

63
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,708
Even if my subordinates
were transformed,

64
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:51,458
they're under my command
and my responsibility.

65
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,666
I saw them being taken
to the farthest gate.

66
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,583
Someone has to go save them.

67
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,500
All right then, Reever.
I'm going with you.

68
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:00,583
[REEVER]
No, Allen.

69
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,000
[MARVIN]
I'm coming too.

70
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,708
Count me in.

71
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,375
You guys.

72
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,291
A word, Inspector Link.

73
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,875
I require your skills
for a secret task.

74
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,875
Your abilities haven't
gotten rusty, have they?

75
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:29,125
[LULU BELL]
Damn humans.

76
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,958
[CROSS] To destroy the
egg with a single blow,

77
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,625
Klaud, Socalo, and I have
to synchronize our attacks

78
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,666
to hit the target
at the same time.

79
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,583
Then again, there's no guarantee

80
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,333
we'll actually be
able to break it.

81
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:42,458
After all, this is dark matter
we're talking about.

82
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,125
Do what you can, General.

83
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,958
[CROSS]
Very well.

84
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,333
Ready whenever you are, Miranda.

85
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,125
Yes, General.

86
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,541
[MARIE]
Hm?

87
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,208
[MARIE]
Where's that noise coming from?

88
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,041
[gasps]

89
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,750
Miranda!

90
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,083
Noel Organon!

91
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,791
[MARIE]
My strings cut right through it!

92
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:25,375
What the hell is that thing?
Is it even alive?

93
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,083
We've met her before.

94
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:31,000
The Noah of Lust has the ability
to take any form she wants.

95
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,291
The egg belongs to the Noah!

96
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,666
It's coming with me.

97
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,500
[MIRANDA]
I can't breathe!

98
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,791
I wonder if your ability
stops when you die.

99
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,333
Let's find out, shall we?

100
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:00,875
The egg is sinking!

101
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,958
That means time must be
moving forward again!

102
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,791
Do you really think you
stand a chance against me?

103
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:25,000
Do you really think we'd let
the egg return to the Earl?

104
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,291
Right.

105
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,958
[SOCALO]
Madness! Cremation Dance!

106
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,916
Pathetic.

Bastard!

108
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,666
That killed the large
Akuma with one blow.

109
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,708
But it had no
effect on the Noah!

110
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,625
[KLAUD] Our turn, Lau Jimin!
Destroy the egg!

111
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,958
You realize you're wasting time.

112
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,625
This time we got her!

113
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,500
[KLAUD]
She was just liquid.

114
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:26,083
Can she change her
form that quickly?

115
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,291
Arrow of Original Sin.

116
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,833
General Cross's attack
should've been a direct hit.

117
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,750
And it didn't even
scratch the egg?

118
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,250
Its power is remarkable!

119
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,666
Still hasn't cracked.

120
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,375
Let's change that.

I don't know what,

breaking the lab apart.

Don't worry about us, Allen!

Better hurry,

or we'll end up getting
dragged into the battle!

Don't you worry.

She isn't allowing any
of our Generals' attacks

to get past her defense!

157
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,166
Well, the logical choice would
be focus on defeating the Noah

instead of destroying the egg.

There just happens to be
one problem with that plan!

Currently the enemy has Miranda
absorbed inside her body!

Almost there.

164
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,875
Little worm!

165
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:08,833
[LULU BELL gasps]

166
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,000
[LULU BELL]
The egg's breaking!

167
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:17,208
It's no use! I can't stop it!

168
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,250
Time's up.

169
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,958
We can hold back our attacks
because of Miranda,

170
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,958
or end this right now.

171
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,750
[SOCALO] Looks like
the only way we can win

172
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:29,208
is by taking out the Noah
and the egg all at once.

173
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:47,208
Destroying the egg takes
precedence over everything else.

174
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:57,083
You can't be serious!
Generals, please!

175
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,708
Activate Long-Range
Form, Lau Jimin!

176
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,291
[KLAUD]
Armor-Piercing Cannon! Lau Guns!

177
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,583
[CROSS]
Judgment's level: Atonement.

178
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,625
Increasing power
to triple damage.

179
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,500
[LULU BELL] The Exorcists are
raising their energy levels!

180
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,500
They plan on fighting?

181
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,041
[LULU BELL]
But I've got a bargaining chip.

182
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:37,583
Sure you want to
do this, Exorcists?

183
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,000
You'd go so far as to
kill one of your comrades

184
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,583
in order to stop me?

185
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:45,958
And such a pretty one. Surely
her power is of value to you.

186
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:49,958
The fiend is using Miranda's
body as a shield for the egg!

187
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,083
[LULU BELL] Are you
willing to destroy the egg

188
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:56,416
if it means murdering
one of your own?

189
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,750
[SOCALO]
She's an Exorcist. Like us.

190
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:02,500
I'm sure the girl's prepared to
die for a cause she believes in.

191
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,125
She won't have to.

192
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,250
[gasps]

193
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,625
I can't hold on!

[ORDER MEMBERS yelling]

195
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,250
Come in, Generals!

196
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,458
Marie! Miranda?

197
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,583
[DOCTOR A]
Everyone, get down!

198
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,083
[LENALEE screams]

199
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,083
What's going on?

200
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,333
Hey! Are you all right?

201
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,916
Hold on while I move
this out of the way!

202
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,208
Just hang on!

203
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,333
[KANDA]
I'll take this!

204
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,750
Wow! That was amazing!

205
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,000
This blade needs sharpening.

206
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:32,583
[LULU BELL]
Finally, safe at last.

207
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:35,291
I need to hurry and
get back to my Master.

208
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,458
It's not too late to repair you.

209
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,416
Damn those Generals.

210
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,541
[gasps]

211
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,791
[LULU BELL]
What is that white lump?

212
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,416
[LULU BELL]
You bastard!

213
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,791
You truly are a heartless
man, Cross Marian.

214
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,791
You knew he was
down there all along.

215
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,166
But you kept on firing anyway.

216
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,625
Didn't hit him.

217
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,875
In any case, he is a
Transcendent One.

218
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:29,208
Stop this! If you damage
it anymore, it'll--!

219
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:39,000
Allen Walker!
I'll kill you for this!

220
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,291
You're a terrible Master.

221
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:54,583
I did it because I had
faith in you, my apprentice.

222
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,958
The portal's vanished.

223
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,500
[KOMUI] General Cross!
Can you hear me?

224
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:23,500
General? Give me
a status report!

225
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,458
The Noah retreated?

226
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,583
And the egg?

227
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:29,875
You were able to destroy it?

228
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:34,916
[ORDER MEMBERS celebrating]

229
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,500
[BOOKMAN]
Hm?

230
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,458
Is she going to live?

231
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:09,125
[BOOKMAN] There's no need to
worry. She's just unconscious.

232
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,208
What a relief.

233
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,583
Allen, wait.

234
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,875
I have to check on
Reever and the others.

235
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,666
I'm worried about them.

[ALLEN]
A new, bizarre Akuma appears

239
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:18,916
after feasting on the lives of
Science Section Members.

240
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,500
As it continues to evolve,

241
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:23,416
what terrifying form
will finally emerge?

242
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,791
On the next D.Gray-man:
"Level Four."

243
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:30,166
Bring forth salvation to
this poor Akuma's soul!

It's so pretty.

All right, short stack.

on doin' with that?

Oh.

00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:44,375
I just wanted to show my friend
Kanda some harmless sparklers.

[KANDA]
Tch.
