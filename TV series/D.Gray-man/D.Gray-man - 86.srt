1
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:42,000
[ALLEN] If you do one more thing
to hurt any of my friends...

2
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,500
Then you'd better be
prepared for me to kill you.

3
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:55,250
Why don't we have
the last dance?

4
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:00,666
[ROAD]
Come on, Bookman.

5
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:04,541
[ROAD] Get real. If you
thought teleportation

6
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,000
was the only surprise
I had up my sleeve,

7
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:10,125
you've got another
thing coming.

8
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:13,583
You and I are gonna have
so much fun together.

9
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,541
You might as well
get comfortable.

10
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,583
You're trapped in
Road Kamelot's dream

11
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:20,500
and I'm not letting
you out anytime soon!

12
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:22,500
[ROAD laughs]

13
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,041
[ALLEN gasps]

14
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:06,750
[TYKI]
It's like you're protected

15
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,458
by a full suit of armor.

16
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,958
You can call it a clown as
much as you like, but from

17
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:16,416
where I'm standing, it looks
a helluva lot like a devil.

18
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,875
This is getting interesting.
I'm looking forward to it.

19
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,291
Just like I did that night.
That left arm of yours.

20
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm going to destroy it,
and rip it right off your body.

21
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,541
Better get ready.

22
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,208
[ALLEN] Here it comes.
The deadly power

23
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:42,666
that the Earl and the Noah have
that can destroy Innocence!

24
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,083
I'll never forget
the way that felt.

25
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,833
[KOMUI]
Listen, Allen.

26
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,958
Next time a Noah confronts you,

27
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,375
if they try to destroy
your Innocence,

28
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,541
you find a way to escape them.

29
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:02,333
Trust me, you must never
fight them head-on.

30
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:05,458
Just as Noahs and Akuma
are weak to Innocence,

31
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,958
they're also a
serious threat to it.

32
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,125
These two forces
are polar opposites,

33
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,208
the same as light and shadow.

34
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:16,416
Even though your Crown Clown is
an advanced form of Innocence,

35
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,208
that doesn't make it an
exception to this fact.

36
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,666
I'm telling you, Allen.

37
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,041
Don't ever let yourself
lose your Innocence again.

38
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,500
Oh? Not running away?

39
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:35,041
[ALLEN]
Sorry, Komui. But...

40
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,041
[ALLEN yells]

41
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,833
[ALLEN]
I won't run!

42
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,708
Don't even try to stop me.
My power is absolute!

43
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,083
I will absolve you
of responsibility to this

44
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:54,500
so-called "God" who controls
you Exorcists! How's that?

45
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,083
[ALLEN grunts]

46
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,333
It's over for you now,
Allen Walker!

47
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,416
[ALLEN yells]

48
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,708
[LENALEE, CHAOZII yell]

49
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:07,791
What was that?

50
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,333
[LENALEE]
Huh?

51
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:14,791
Don't fight him!
He'll kill you!

52
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,458
[TYKI] So a single
attack won't do.

53
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,041
[LENALEE gasps]

54
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:23,041
Well, it is an evolved form, so
I would expect it to be sturdy.

55
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:28,208
A second blow should do the
trick. Now, stop resisting, boy.

56
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,291
Oh, Road. You're back.

57
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:35,833
Cut it out, Tycky. Don't put too
many scratches on my boyfriend.

58
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,250
You'll find a new one.

59
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,250
[ROAD]
Hmph.

60
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,125
No. He's coming this way.

61
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:45,666
Exorcist Allen, you have
to wake up! Run away!

62
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,041
You can't do this.

63
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:51,041
Stay back. I'm not gonna
let you murder my comrade!

64
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,375
[LAVI gasps]

65
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,875
[BOOKMAN]
What is it, Lavi?

66
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,958
Lavi? Lavi!

67
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:05,875
Hey, Deek.

68
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,416
[LAVI]
Eh?

69
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:12,208
[LAVI] Aah! Come on, geezer!
What was that about?

70
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,083
[BOOKMAN] Quiet, you!
Stop being absentminded!

71
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,625
You are Lavi now!
Do you understand me?

72
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,833
Oh, did I answer to the
name from the previous log?

73
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:24,125
You little fool!
You need to focus.

74
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:28,625
Our next log will be much more
difficult than the last one.

75
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,458
So what's the next log?

76
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:34,166
We're joining the Black Order,
a military group.

77
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,708
We'll both become Exorcists
and document the events

78
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,041
of the war between
the Order and the Akuma,

79
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,375
which will most likely
become a secret history

80
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,500
once it's all said and done.

81
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:49,208
[LAVI] Wait, where am I?
Oh, right.

82
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,916
I was inside Noah's Ark with
Allen and the rest of the team,

83
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,708
and then Road teleported my
mind into this dream world.

84
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,833
This isn't really happening!

85
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:02,958
This is just the vision
that Road wanted me to see!

86
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:06,250
[BOOKMAN] What is it now, Lavi?
You're acting restless.

87
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:09,541
Just sit down and
be quiet for a change.

88
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:14,541
So that little brat must've
read my memories. Pretty smart.

89
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:17,916
But not smart enough!
I'm out of here!

90
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,500
[OTHER LAVI]
But where will you go?

91
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,500
Are you planning
to return to the people

92
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:25,083
whose lives you had
been recording as Lavi?

93
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,750
Great, it's me again.

94
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:31,166
You know, there's simply nowhere
left for you to return to.

95
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,708
Living out your
life as a Bookman,

96
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,875
you've never truly called
anyplace "home," remember?

97
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:40,041
So why would you have
anything to go back to now?

98
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,125
After all, your mind isn't
to be found anywhere

99
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,333
in the natural world.

100
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,333
Bookmen are nothing
but spectators.

101
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,833
You've never fully
trusted anyone.

102
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:54,416
How fitting that
you'd end up alone.

103
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,458
Tell me something
I don't know.

104
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,166
What a shame.

105
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,208
Your mind's become
poisoned by your time

106
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:04,333
among the humans and Akuma.
It's easy to see that the light

107
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:08,958
in your eye doesn't shine as
brightly as it did in the past.

108
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,500
[LAVI gasps]

109
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,000
[LAVI]
Please, no.

110
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,375
Lenalee! Wake up!

111
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,708
What are you upset about?

112
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,291
That sort of thing is
just a part of life.

113
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:27,083
You should understand
that by now.

114
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,250
[LENALEE grunts]

115
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:41,791
[ALLEN] I'm not gonna
let you tear my mind apart.

116
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,458
Thank goodness.

117
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:49,791
[ALLEN] And there's no way
I'm gonna run away from you!

118
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:58,000
[ALLEN laughs weakly]

119
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,958
Interesting.
Someone's all too eager

120
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,166
to get his arm ripped off again.

121
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,375
[ALLEN coughs]

122
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,375
Don't get too close!
You're a Parasite Type, Allen.

123
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,375
If you touch him,
it'll put a strain

124
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:13,875
on not only your Innocence,
but your whole body!

125
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,833
Please be careful.

126
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:25,750
Listen, Tyki. You've really got
the wrong idea about Exorcists.

127
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,416
You think if you can demolish
our Anti-Akuma weapons,

128
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,833
all that'll be left
are regular human bodies.

129
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:36,625
Nothing but flesh and bone,
with no special powers.

130
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,208
But the Exorcists
that you should really

131
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:42,458
be afraid of are
the ones like that.

132
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:46,250
Our abilities might be
born from Innocence.

133
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:51,750
But even so, our human minds
control those abilities.

134
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:55,583
And as long as my mind is
connected to my Innocence...

135
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:59,708
[LENALEE] What?
His left arm, it's...!

136
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,791
[ALLEN] As long as my body
exists to hold it...

137
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,875
As long as I'm still
an Exorcist...

138
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,375
[TYKI gasps]

139
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:11,333
[ALLEN] As long as this world
has things I care about...

140
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,291
[TYKI gasps]

141
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,875
What just happened?

142
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,416
Did he...?

143
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,166
[TYKI gasps]

144
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,291
[ALLEN] The Crown Clown
will never be defeated

145
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,291
by you or anybody!

146
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,416
[LENALEE] How is his
Anti-Akuma weapon still working

147
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,083
after all that?

148
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:35,291
Could Allen's Innocence
have repaired it on its own?

149
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,250
[TYKI]
What was that just now?

150
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:43,541
For a moment there,
I felt like I had died.

151
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,541
Was that sudden surge
of power caused

152
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,416
by the spirit of the
boy's Innocence, or...?

153
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,541
[ALLEN]
Tyki Mikk.

154
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:55,791
You take humankind
far too lightly.

155
00:10:55,875 --> 00:11:02,125
[TYKI laughs]

156
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,958
[TYKI pants]

157
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:07,458
Heh. You're really something,
aren't you, boy?

158
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,958
All right, I think I understand
now. So the only way

159
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:15,708
to stop your Innocence is to
kill you first, is that right?

160
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,625
Road, what's happening
to him, Lero?

161
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,916
I think Tycky
might've snapped.

162
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,750
[TYKI] Reject. Reject,
reject, reject. Reject!

163
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,666
[ALLEN]
Aah!

164
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:36,791
I must say I was
touched by your words.

165
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:40,583
I hope you'll accept a
small token of my thanks.

166
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,708
[LERO] Whew!
That was close, Lero!

167
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,958
If you'd noticed that
swirling vortex of death

168
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,583
even a second later,
the rest of us

169
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,083
would have been sucked
into it too, Lero!

170
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,583
That's crazy.

171
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:05,125
Look over there!
Exorcist Lavi, wake up!

172
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:08,708
Oh, no, I'm still not
getting through to him!

173
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,666
Whatever Road did to him,
he's still under her spell!

174
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,125
Lavi! We'll save you!

175
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,833
He means business, Lero!

176
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,833
[ROAD] No kidding. Is he trying
to tear the whole place down?

177
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:35,041
Road! Tell the truth!
What's gonna happen to Allen?

178
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:39,875
Well, he's inside that,
so it's pretty dangerous.

179
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,333
Tycky represents "pleasure,"

180
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:45,208
so he can control
anything, if it exists.

181
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:48,750
It looks like the space around
Allen is starting to disappear.

182
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:53,750
I assume Tycky's creating a
vacuum by rejecting the air.

183
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:57,083
If this keeps up, Allen
won't just suffocate--

184
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,791
he'll cease to exist altogether!

185
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,875
Humans experience pain,
loss, and eventually death

186
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,666
without being able to
choose an alternative.

187
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,958
Perhaps I might pity them for
their disadvantage, but fear?

188
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:12,166
Never. That would
just make me pathetic.

189
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,541
You know. I've enjoyed
each of our little

190
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,208
interactions thus far, boy.

191
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,000
Allen's dying?

192
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,541
[ALLEN gasps]

193
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:31,083
But then, even good
things must end.

194
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,625
[TYKI] Oh, dear,
you can't breathe?

195
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,333
Well, that's probably because
I removed all the air in here

196
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,541
with the intention
of suffocating you.

197
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:48,958
[ALLEN snarls]

198
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,708
[TYKI] Fortunately, I'm doing
just fine without it.

199
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:03,208
[ALLEN] Damn it.
It's still too soon.

200
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,791
Innocence...

201
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,583
Yet somehow you're
still conscious.

202
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:12,916
Quite the valiant effort, but
you might as well surrender.

203
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,541
That bothersome clown
is about to be annihilated

204
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:19,250
along with your pitiful corpse.
Lord Millennium is enough

205
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,958
of a clown anyway.
What's the use of another?

206
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,833
[ALLEN]
No...

207
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:27,875
It looks as though you're
approaching your breaking point.

208
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,500
[ALLEN]
Now!

209
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:36,666
What's wrong, boy?
This is your chance to attack.

210
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,708
[ALLEN] I can't move
in this vacuum!

211
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,916
My arm feels like
it's being crushed!

212
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,583
It's gone. I can't
activate it anymore.

213
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,458
Oh, Allen.

214
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,125
[LENALEE]
Allen...

215
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,916
What can we do?

216
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,916
[LENALEE]
That's it.

217
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,625
[CHAOZII]
Huh?

218
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,333
I've had enough!

219
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,625
Being trapped in
a place like this,

220
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:19,708
watching my comrades fight...
I can't take it!

221
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:24,125
[LENALEE sobs, pants]

222
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,750
[LENALEE grunts]

223
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,166
[LENALEE grunts, yelps]

224
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,416
Lenalee, no...

225
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,000
[LENALEE grunts]

226
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,041
Stop, Lenalee,
that won't help!

227
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,500
You'll hurt yourself!
Please don't!

228
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,750
[LENALEE grunts]

229
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,458
Just give up. It's no use.

230
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,916
I mean, it's not like your
Innocence is even activated

231
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,250
on your legs. So you'll
never break through that way.

232
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,208
Whoa. Lenalee.
Your leg!

233
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:58,750
[LENALEE pants]

234
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,125
Let me go.

235
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,541
If you keep doing that,
you'll just break your leg!

236
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,083
You and I both know
you don't have

237
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,791
enough strength in you
to fight right now!

238
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,208
[LENALEE pants]

239
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:11,208
I don't care. I'm still
an Exorcist, Chaozii!

240
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,458
[CHAOZII gasps]

241
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,708
[LENALEE] Fighting is
my reason for existing!

242
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:19,708
So please. Step aside
and let me fight!

243
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,250
[TYKI gasps]

244
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:31,791
[TYKI] How is this kid
still conscious?

245
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:36,875
[ALLEN] I can't die.
I want to live,

246
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:41,208
so that I can defeat Tyki Mikk
and the rest of the Noahs.

247
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:46,416
No, wait. That's not the real
reason I want to go on living.

248
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,541
[ALLEN] I want to live
because there are things

249
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:55,000
that matter to me. Right!

250
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:01,541
[ALLEN] I'm supposed to
protect humans and Akuma.

251
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,083
So...

252
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,291
[ALLEN]
Please, Innocence.

253
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,625
If I'm going to get
out of this awful place,

254
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:14,833
I need you to be strong enough
to overcome Tyki Mikk's ability.

255
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:18,625
I can't die,
not here, not now!

256
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,375
There's still so much
that I have to do!

257
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,666
If I can't activate
you like before,

258
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,541
then we have to find
another way to synchronize!

259
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:30,166
A better, stronger way!
Come on, please!

260
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,750
Let's fuse together even more
and make a weapon

261
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,708
great enough to
protect the world!

262
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,500
[ALLEN shudders]

263
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,583
[TYKI] I don't know
what you're trying to do,

264
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,875
but you're not
going to succeed.

265
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,750
Because I'm about to
pull out your heart.

266
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,666
[ALLEN yelps]

267
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,166
[ALLEN]
I have to focus.

268
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,833
Just think about synchronizing
with my Innocence!

269
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,875
Why's his body
glowing like this?

270
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:11,375
Mistress Road.
What's happening, Lero?

271
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,333
No idea.

272
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,291
It's something big.

273
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,500
[KOMUI] I haven't mentioned the
ark to the Great Generals yet,

274
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,000
so please be careful.

275
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,625
I will be, Chief.
So has there really been

276
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,333
a sudden change in
Hevlaska's condition?

277
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,916
That means...

278
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,666
[GREAT GENERAL A]
You're late, Komui.

279
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,875
[KOMUI] I do apologize,
Great Generals.

280
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,333
Komui and Reever,
at your service.

281
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,833
Look behind you.

282
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,458
The process is
underway now.

283
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,958
[HEVLASKA wails]

284
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,833
But why?

285
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,125
[HEVLASKA]
It hurts.

286
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:58,708
The cube inside
my body is raging.

287
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:01,750
It's thrashing about
like a beast!

288
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,750
There's a Transcendent One?

289
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,000
[GREAT GENERAL B]
Indeed.

290
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,333
[GREAT GENERAL C]
One who synchronizes

291
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:10,333
with their Innocence
at over 100 percent.

292
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:14,583
I don't know who that person is;
just that they'll appear soon!

293
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,125
[GREAT GENERAL A]
A Transcendent One--

294
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:19,875
an Exorcist who can
become a new General!

295
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,916
[GREAT GENERALS] Yes. One with
great power is soon to arrive!

296
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
[KOMUI gasps]

297
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,666
Does that mean it's
one of the Exorcists

298
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,750
fighting in Japan right now?

299
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,291
[KOMUI] That's strange.
I don't understand.

300
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:36,875
Why am I suddenly
thinking of Allen Walker?

301
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:41,291
[KOMUI] No. He's only 15--
it can't be him!

302
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,708
It isn't possible.

303
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,625
Hey, Chief.

304
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:49,541
Well... This is crazy, but you
don't think that it could be...

305
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:54,333
It... It's not
Allen Walker, is it?

306
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,833
[HEVLASKA wails]

307
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:57,958
[HEVLASKA]
Now!

308
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,500
[TYKI gasps]

309
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,875
[ALLEN] My left arm
is for Akuma.

310
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,750
My right arm's for humans.

311
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:15,041
I'm supposed to save them both.
That's what I decided.

312
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:18,166
You and I are together as one.

313
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,958
[TYKI gasps]

314
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,166
How the hell can
this be happening?

315
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,416
What the...? That sword!

316
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,916
Achieving transcendence.
Crown Clown is now active!

317
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,083
[ALLEN] In a critical moment,
perhaps in response

318
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,583
to the strength of my
feelings, my Innocence

319
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,458
took the shape
of a mighty sword.

320
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:22,291
And the longer the fight
against Tyki Mikk rages on,

321
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:25,416
the clearer the
blade's power becomes.

322
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,791
On the next D. Gray-man,
"Transcendent One."

323
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:32,333
Bring forth salvation
to this poor Akuma's soul!

324
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,708
First things first--
it's time for roll call!

325
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:35,833
--Tsune?
--Here.

326
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,750
--Shima?
--Here.

327
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:40,291
Lenalee?

328
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:41,500
Present.

329
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:44,000
[KOMUI] What?
I can't hear you, my dear!

330
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:45,000
Present!

331
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:46,583
Cool, the teacher likes you.

332
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:49,000
[KOMUI] You! If you
get within three feet

333
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:51,000
of my precious Lenalee,
it's detention for a year!

334
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,791
Do you understand me?

335
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:56,666
[ALL]
He really does love his sister.
