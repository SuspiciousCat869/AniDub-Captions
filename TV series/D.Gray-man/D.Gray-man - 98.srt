00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,750
You. Allen!

[ALL gasp]

3
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,583
If it isn't Allen Walker.

4
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,875
I'll make you pay for this.

5
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,416
You won't get away!

6
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,625
Now, gate, open.

7
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:22,041
Heaven Compass! Get on, boy!

[alarm blaring]

10
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:52,666
[SCIENTIST A]
Don't panic.

11
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,291
Maintain focus and
accuracy, all right?

12
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,083
I need you to check
this right away.

13
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,541
Yes, sir.

14
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,166
One would normally expect
the Branch Chief in command

15
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,750
to be punctual during a crisis.

16
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:06,541
[KOMUI] I'm sorry. I had a
necessary task to tend to first.

17
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,375
Lenalee? That task?

18
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,833
And where is she
during this dire time?

19
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:17,083
[KOMUI] On standby with Lavi
in one of the sickrooms.

20
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:20,750
Is that so? Standby, huh?

21
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,791
[KOMUI] We're under a
full-scale Akuma ambush.

22
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:25,875
There's nothing an Exorcist

23
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,500
deprived of their
Innocence can do.

24
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,333
[ROUVELIER]
Do you really believe that?

25
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:36,958
When push comes to shove...

26
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:40,541
You have to let me talk
to Hevlaska, Komui!

27
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:41,708
Experiment?

28
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,333
I'll beg Hevlaska.

29
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:46,416
Ask her to implant an
Innocence in my body.

30
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,625
I know for a fact the people
in those experiments

31
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,750
weren't Accomodators.

32
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,833
But since I am, I may be able
to respond to the Innocence

33
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,583
where they couldn't.

34
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:03,583
[LENALEE] And I'll be able
to save them. Everyone.

35
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,375
I'd be able to save
you, big brother.

36
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,666
[KANDA]
Komui!

Brief me on the situation.

[KOMUI]
What are you doing down here?

39
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,791
You're supposed
to be on standby.

40
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,041
You can't be serious!

41
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,125
[thud]

42
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,708
[KOMUI]
You don't have Mugen.

43
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,250
How the hell do you
expect to help them?

44
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,541
You'll be a burden!

45
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,250
Say that again. I'll be a what?

46

Follow your orders, Kanda.

[KOMUI] Please. We cannot
afford to lose you now.

Kanda!

00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:56,291
[KOMUI]
Stay here.

50
00:04:56,375 --> 00:05:00,458
You're the only active
Exorcists I've got left.

51
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:05,000
I know it's a lot to ask,
but I'm sending you in.

52
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,083
Using the Ark is a risk,

53
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,750
but Allen and Bookman
need backup.

54

[SKULL B laughs]

00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,291
I guess I shouldn't complain
as long as they're distracted.

00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,541
[ALLEN] Just hang in there!
I'm coming for you!

Well now, lucky you. You pass.

[BOOKMAN] It seems I
got a little too close

to that Akuma's powers.

this is the end for me.

Hang on!

How's it coming?

Not too much longer now.

Don't be hasty with it.

We're only gonna get
one shot at this.

If this keeps up, the Earl's
gonna walk away scot-free

[BAK] We're screwed
if we lose that egg.

It's the only way
to prevent the Earl

from creating new Akuma.

it no matter what.

plan on doing about it?

Oh, Allen Walker.
It's time I break you.

For my Master.

The kid's really taking
control of things.

[ALLEN]
Are you okay?

114
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,875
Hang on, I'm coming!

115
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,291

Careful, boy.

Please, get me out of here.

Uh, are you all right?

[SCIENTIST D]
I-I'm not sure. Please help me.

119
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,208
Well, isn't this convenient?

120
00:09:56,291 --> 00:10:00,291
I'll send you both packing to
the hereafter with one ticket.

121
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,958
Ah! An Akuma!

122
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,208

[AKUMA B]
Not a chance!

You didn't get hit, did you?

125
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:17,458
No, you just saved my life.

126

Thank you very much, Allen.

127
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,500
You're so thoughtful.

128
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,041
The fact that you were fooled
by such a simple deception

129
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,958
goes to show you're
as soft as ever.

[ALLEN]
Lulu... Bell.

131
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:47,333
[AKUMA B] I'm gonna make sure
you suffer before you die.

132
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,708
Worthless Exorcist scum.

[LULU BELL]
Hold it.

134
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:55,166
This is perfect. Let's
take him home with us.

135
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,250
[AKUMA B]
What?

136
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,666
He was handpicked
by the Fourteenth

137
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,833
to fill the role of the Player.

138
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,750
I have a feeling our Master
will want to speak with him.

139
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,291
[AKUMA B]
Yes, ma'am.

140
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,333
[LULU BELL] We've recovered
the egg. Let's go.

141
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:16,500
[SKULL B]
Go on, keep it moving, c'mon.

142
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:17,750
Come along now.

143
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,083
You don't live here
anymore, rookies.

144
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:23,208
We're taking you all
to your new home.

145
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:27,166
Very good. That's it,
just walk right in.

146
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,458
I'm going ahead with Allen.

147
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,083
Kill the remaining
humans in the lab.

148
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,958
[AKUMA C]
Yes, ma'am.

149
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,916
They're taking him.

150
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,083
Well, old man, it's time
to say your final farewell.

151
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:46,583
Did you really think the two of
you alone could stop us?

152
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,666
[AKUMA B] What the hell?
We can't pass through!

153
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,291
[AKUMA C]
A barrier?

154
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,916
They've got talismans!

155
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,500
You're not taking
Allen with you!

156
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:04,166
Never underestimate
the Science Section!

157
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,833
[AKUMA D]
Cocky bastard!

158
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,333
[AKUMA D]
You've only stalled us!

159
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,583
We'll kick through soon enough!

160
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,500
These makeshift talismans
won't last for long.

161
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,833
I'm well aware.

162
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,625
Dammit, Walker, wake up!
You're gonna get captured!

163
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,666
Please, wake up, Allen!

164
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,125
[BAK]
Pull it together, Walker!

165
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,541
Allen!

166
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,291
[BOOKMAN]
Come on, boy.

167
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,250
Wake up! Allen!

168
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,750
You hear that?

169
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,833
[LENALEE]
It's Allen!

170
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,791
I'm awake.

171
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,708
[ALLEN]
Thanks, guys.

172
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,708
Dammit!

173
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,916
Time Record! Activate!

174
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:08,958
[SKULL B]
Huh?

175
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:12,958
[MIRANDA] Enveloping target.
Time absorption. Reverse!

176
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,458
[SOCALO]
Not too shabby.

177
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:33,083
The Ark makes for a pretty
stylish ride, doesn't it, kid?

178
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:40,208
[SOCALO] All right, Akuma,
I'm giving you a choice.

179
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:43,666
If you got any preference
on how you wanna die,

180
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,208
now's the time to speak up!

181
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,166
It's enormous.

182
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,791
Holy crap!

183
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,583
It's a behemoth!

184
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:25,708
[SOCALO laughing]

185
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,083
[SOCALO]
A challenge!

186
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,791
Looks like it's my
lucky day after all!

187
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:33,375
[ALL gasp]

188
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,916
[SOCALO]
Can't you people recognize

189
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,416
a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity?

190
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Well, if you don't mind,

191
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,166
I'm gonna go ahead
and dive right in.

192
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,291
[KLAUD]
Go on, it's all yours.

193
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,000
No objections here.

194
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,708
[CROSS] Unless it's filled with
booze, I couldn't care less.

195
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,875
[SOCALO]
Don't give me that aloof crap.

196
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,375
You guys just have
to play it cool.

197
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,250
Well, fine. More fun for me!

198
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:05,833
[SOCALO]
Torture, torture, torture!

199
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:12,083
[SOCALO]
Madness!

200
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:25,666
[SOCALO laughing]

201
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,125
[SOCALO] Y'know, today
feels like the perfect day

202
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,916
to cut loose.

203
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,708
[SOCALO]
Do your worst!

204
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,500
Amazing.

205
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,083
[AKUMA D]
Shouldn't you be focusing on me?

206
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,583
Not good!

207
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,125
Thanks for the workout.

208
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,083
Now die.

209
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,250
Allen!

210
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,791
Oh, no!

211
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,916
[AKUMA E] The Generals
have shown themselves!

212
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Kill them! Kill them all!

213
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,416
Oh, no! There's more of them!

214
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,458
There's so many!

215
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,208
[SOCALO]
Please tell me I'm awake

216
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,333
'cause this is like
a dream come true.

217
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,500
Maker of Eden, activate!

218
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,708
Garden of Embrace!

219
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,125
[BAK]
The Garden of Embrace.

220
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,583
That's the Order's strongest
defense technique.

221
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,041
[RENI]
Well, thank goodness.

222
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:10,375
We weren't exactly handling
things so well on our own.

223
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,458
C'mon, quit straggling!

224
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,125
[SKULL B]
Hurry up and go!

225
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,166
They've got Tup.

226
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,583
Hey, Johnny!

227
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,666
[KLAUD] Sorry, but we're
gonna leave you here

228
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,833
to look after the lab techs.

229
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,583
Sure, fine with me.

230
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,708
You three can handle the rest
of the Akuma easily enough.

231
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:41,208
Well, as long as the prodigal
son hasn't gotten too rusty.

232
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,625
Hang on. Were you
referring to me?

233
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,583
[TIEDOLL] Who else would
I be talking about?

234
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,625
What, you want me to
prove myself to you?

235
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,166
You ready to come out and play?

236
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,500
Time for Judgment.

237
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:58,750
All right, Lau Jimin. Activate.

238
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:08,416
Lau Jimin, Anti-Akuma,
Parasite Type. Go!

239
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,166
Not too bad.

240
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,791
You're not expecting
us to do all the work.

241
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,958
You want me to work? Damn.

242
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:52,666
After all this time, I thought
you knew me better than that.

243
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,791
How would you like
it if I whipped you?

244
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,041
[CROSS]
Hey, I wouldn't say no.

245
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,041
Thanks for the motivation,

246
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:02,166
but let's save it for the
bedroom after the battle.

247
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,333
[grunts]

248
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,375
Brainless fools.

249
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:36,125
[SOCALO]
Hmm?

250
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,500
Cross!

251
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:40,333
Don't go tossing me your
scraps, I'm fine on my own.

252
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:50,500
[HUGE AKUMA E]
Exorcists.

253
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:59,833
[HUGE AKUMA E]
Exorcists.

254
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:04,416
[laughing]

255
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,750
[AKUMA E groaning]

256
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,708
So brutal.

257
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:30,333
[SOCALO] Like warm rain
on a spring afternoon.

258
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,916
[MARIE] This is Lab 5.
Come in, command center.

259
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,125
Noise Marie speaking.
Can you hear me?

260
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:47,791
The Akuma threat to
Headquarters has been cleared.

261
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,333
[ALLEN] The attack on
Headquarters persists.

262
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:27,750
Komui gives the order
to destroy the egg.

263
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:30,500
However, a mysterious
fluid floods the lab

264
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:34,375
as soon as the attack begins
and Miranda is swallowed by it.

265
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:37,958
On the next D.Gray-Man:
"The Noah of Lust."

266
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:41,416
Bring forth salvation to
this poor Akuma's soul!

267
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,666
So beautiful!

268
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,416
I love summer!

269
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,416
I don't think fireworks are
supposed to be hurled like that.

270
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,750
What? Really?

271
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,416
No, they're not.
