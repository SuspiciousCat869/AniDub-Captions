1
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,166
We're talkin' high quality,
so how about it, then?

2
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,750
Ever since we crossed the strait

3
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:01,791
everything's had a wonderful,
Asian feel to it, y'know?

4
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:04,541
Yeah, crazy how
Asian Asia can be.

5
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,666
This rice looks delectable!

6
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:10,958
Well, according to
our faithful guide here,

7
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:14,333
it appears that my Master
is headed even further east.

8
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,708
How much further,
Allen, like India or China?

9
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,791
Yeah, tell us how
far your Master went...

10
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,791
Where will we find the General?!

11
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:27,291
The world is so huge
it'd be tough to guess...

12
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:28,666
That's true!

13
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,958
The world is vast
and full of wonders,

14
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,541
like this marvelous
stretching ice cream...

15
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,750
I've never had such a thing!

16
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,208
Well, this trip's
probably the best way

17
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,958
for Krory to broaden
his horizons, right?

18
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,083
Krory!

19
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,166
Are you okay?!

20
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,916
Come on, man,
don't pass out on us...

21
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,750
Hmmm...

22
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:59,333
You are not to let the
group join General Cross...

23
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:03,125
Those are the instructions
we received from the Earl,

24
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:04,791
but there are four Exorcists

25
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,333
and they're all supposed
to be tough, aren't they...?

26
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:11,041
Especially when they're
all together like that.

27
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:17,791
Perhaps... we should
try separating them...

28
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,375
Oh yes, fantastic idea!

29
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,125
I knew you would think of
something, Madame Lulu Bell!

30
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,125
The Order should
have called ahead

31
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,500
and made a
reservation for us here.

32
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,666
New guests!

33
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,666
I take it you're with the
Black Order, is that right?

34
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,833
We were notified of your stay
and have rooms ready for you.

35
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,416
Thank you very much.

36
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,333
You're quite welcome and we'll
show you to your rooms at once.

37
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,750
Would you please
see to their bags?

38
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,500
Of course, sir... May I?

39
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,833
Thanks!

40
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:03,708
Maybe we'll finally be
able to get a little rest...

41
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,125
Lavi... where did Krory go?

42
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,791
He... was right here...

43
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,916
He's not here?!

44
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:12,666
Don't tell me...

45
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,166
He got lost?!

46
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,625
The world is just so
intriguing and diverse.

47
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,291
It's remarkable how the people

48
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:23,250
of other countries have
their unique delicacies.

49
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,041
Here ya go, enjoy!

50
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,791
Oh, thanks!

51
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,500
It's so good!

52
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,875
Glad ya like it!

53
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,958
But happy faces are the same

54
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,666
no matter what continent
one finds oneself on.

55
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,000
Oh no!

56
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,291
They're all gone...

57
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,250
I'm all by myself here!

58
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,791
Don't panic...

59
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,625
They couldn't have gotten that
far away yet, could they...?

60
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:57,750
I'll just calmly go back the
way I came and look for them.

61
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,541
Lavi!

62
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,750
Allen!

63
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,250
I've found you, Lenalee!

64
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:16,833
I'm sorry!!

65
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,416
Ow!

66
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,625
This is all my fault...

67
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:28,500
Only I could have managed
to get so wretchedly lost.

68
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,000
Lenalee?!

69
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,166
I'm so happy to see you!

70
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,500
Where are Allen and Lavi?

71
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:39,833
Do you mean...

72
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:43,000
Did you get separated
from them, too?!

73
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:47,541
Lenalee... tell me,
are you feeling alright?

74
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:48,875
Yes, I'm fine.

75
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,041
Thank goodness...

76
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,833
Because you seem strange...

77
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,416
No, I just...

78
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,625
I think I've
discovered Innocence...

79
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,458
It's over there.

80
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,000
Innocence!

81
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,375
We should check it out.

82
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,916
Yes, I understand...

83
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,916
I should get to work and stop
acting like I'm on vacation.

84
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:10,416
I am grateful to carry out
my mission as an Exorcist!

85
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,791
Idiot.

86
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,416
See ya later Mister Exorcist!

87
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,166
Do we have any idea
where Krory might've gone?

88
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,166
No, we need to split up
and look for him.

89
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,500
I guess we should...

90
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,750
But I gotta say, the guy's
kind of a pain, ya know?

91
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:29,916
Let's just try to remember that

92
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,916
there's another Noah
member on our trail,

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,250
so we need to
hurry up and find him.

94
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,000
Yes, the Clan of Noah...

95
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,958
I wonder what evil they're
planning for us next...

96
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,458
We, have to be ready

97
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,833
'cause I don't wanna
lose any more friends.

98
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,208
Hey, don't worry.

99
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,041
We're not gonna let that happen.

100
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,541
Right... thanks, you guys.

101
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,500
Now, let's find Krory...

102
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,958
So, how did you
find the Innocence...?

103
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:16,083
Is it causing some sort of
unexplained phenomenon out here?

104
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,666
Pardon me!

105
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,708
It's Akuma!

106
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,375
Hello there, Exorcist!

107
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,500
Prepare yourself!

108
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,458
What?!

109
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,083
Lenalee, what's wrong?

110
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,875
This time, you'll die!

111
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,833
He would have been
wearing a long, black cloak

112
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,333
and his hair sort of sticks up

113
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,625
like horns, honestly,
he looks a lot like Dracula.

114
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:08,208
Oh... Um...

115
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:11,541
Yeah, I saw a guy like
this following you earlier.

116
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,875
Aww, what's the matter?

117
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,541
He's so pathetic!

118
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:29,750
Did you damned creatures come
here to claim the Innocence?

119
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:33,833
Only you have the Innocence
we're after, Exorcist!

120
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:37,291
We're going to relish
smashing your fangs to dust!

121
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,083
Lenalee!

122
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:46,333
What's happened to you?!

123
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,208
Madam Lulu Bell's brilliant...!

124
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,500
We get rid of
this Exorcist now...

125
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,666
That's one down, three to go!

126
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,625
Lenalee!

127
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,750
Why isn't she
fighting the Akuma?!

128
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,583
Krory!

129
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,333
It's me?!

130
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:28,916
What...

131
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,791
No way...

132
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,833
There are two Lenalees!

133
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,000
But how...

134
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,125
That one's obviously the fake.

135
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,166
Uh-oh, she's caught!

136
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,416
So, is this an Akuma

137
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,333
that's taken Lenalee's
form or something?

138
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,416
No, it doesn't appear
to be an Akuma.

139
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,958
It's a human...!

140
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,291
Then I guess Lenalee's just
discovered her own twin sister.

141
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,125
I don't have a twin!

142
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,208
Who are you...?!

143
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,625
And why are you
prentending to be me?

144
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:55,541
Don't ignore us...

145
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,083
Answer her!

146
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:01,250
Alright... fine.

147
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,833
It's terrible to see
Lenalee fight herself!

148
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,041
How are we supposed
to tell which one is real?

149
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:18,833
I don't know. My eye can
only recognize Akuma, Lavi!

150
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,958
So this woman isn't an Akuma

151
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,750
but who on earth could she be?!

152
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,375
Madame Lulu Bell...

153
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,541
Yes, understood!

154
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:44,000
Oh, dammit!

155
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,375
They split up!

156
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,458
We don't have a choice,

157
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:58,916
we're gonna have
to follow both of 'em!

158
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,916
Let's go!

159
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,791
Krory, stick with Allen, okay?

160
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,666
Of course! Thank you!

161
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,666
Extend!

162
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,500
It looks like
they're separating!

163
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,750
But which one has
Madame Lulu Bell?

164
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,458
I want to know who would attempt

165
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,708
to transform into
Lenalee's double!

166
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,583
I'm sorry. I feel so foolish...

167
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:30,875
If only I hadn't gotten lost

168
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,208
none of this would
have happened!

169
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,041
No...

170
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,166
I think this was all a plan

171
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,416
and I'll bet we
would've met the fake

172
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,583
either way,
no matter what we did.

173
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,166
It just never even occurred

174
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,583
to me that she wasn't
the real Lenalee.

175
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,458
But...

176
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,041
I did know that
something was wrong

177
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,958
when they were attacking me and
she didn't join in the fight...

178
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,125
our Lenalee would help a friend.

179
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,291
Listen, you have to
stop blaming yourself...

180
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,916
How can I when
my thoughtlessness

181
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,458
endangered us and
led us into this trap?!

182
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,166
You believe in people

183
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,916
and the truth is
that trusting spirit

184
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,125
is one of your
very best qualities.

185
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,916
Anyway, we're here now
and I just wanna know why...

186
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,083
...why would they take off

187
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,875
with both the real
Lenalee and the fake?

188
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,333
It's no use running from me!

189
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,708
Come on, ya really
think you're gettin' away?

190
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,541
This is like playing a giant
version of Whack-a-Mole!

191
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:43,958
I wonder if Allen and Krory

192
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,500
are having as much
fun chasing the spider.

193
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,000
Didja see it go into that cave?!

194
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,625
Good thing too, because
I'm tired of playing tag!

195
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,000
What is it, did
you see something?!

196
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:19,125
It's nothing. Go ahead.

197
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,791
Lenalee

198
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,375
But... we still don't know
if she's the real one...

199
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,083
...or the imposter.

200
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,791
Please, allow me
to welcome you here!

201
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,166
My feet!

202
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,625
I'm stuck, too!

203
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,041
Yes... you've walked
into my trap!

204
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,791
You see, I have
a special ability

205
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,458
I like to call "Hidden Web"...

206
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,791
I make the threads
completely invisible.

207
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,583
That way I can snare
and kill my prey

208
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,291
with perfection by stretching
and adjusting the thread...

209
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,666
Brilliant...

210
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,583
Akuma abilities are
wonderful and most excellent,

211
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,166
don't you think?

212
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,541
Right there...
We'll do this... and then...

213
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,000
You bastards!

214
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,625
I'll teach you to pay attention
to me when I'm speaking!

215
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,041
Oh, we were listening.

216
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,125
Indeed, carefully.

217
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,458
You were?!

218
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:33,000
Oh, no...!

219
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,125
You ruined it!

220
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,666
Oh, I'm going to enjoy this!

221
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:44,833
Lenalee...

222
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,625
I need you to wake up now!

223
00:14:58,916 --> 00:14:59,958
Alright, this never-ending game

224
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:03,083
of Whack-a-Mole's
gettin' pretty old.

225
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,375
It could be a little
hard core but...

226
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:16,250
Devouring Flame...! Fire Stamp!

227
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,750
One more time...

228
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,291
Direct Fire Stamp!

229
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:53,666
I wonder if I've got the real
Lenalee here... or the fake?

230
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,291
Lenalee!

231
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:04,208
Lavi...? Are Allen and
Krory with you, too?

232
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:07,375
Well, if the first thing on your
mind is the welfare of others,

233
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:10,541
then I guess
I've got the real one.

234
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,375
The real one...

235
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,875
We've gotta go help!

236
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,291
Hey, did that scorpion
Akuma do something to you?

237
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,791
I'm, not sure...

238
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,041
I don't think so...

239
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,916
My body just... feels numb...

240
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
We have to hurry!

241
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,625
C'mon, there's no way
you can fight like this...

242
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,125
You need rest, Lenalee.

243
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,375
Why don't you let me
take care of you, okay...?

244
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,666
You'd be amazed at
how much I've learned

245
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,666
about first aid since
becoming an Exorcist.

246
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,125
Okay...

247
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,916
If I've got the real Lenalee,

248
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,125
that means Allen and
Krory went after the fake...

249
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,416
Thank goodness... you're okay.

250
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
Can you move...

251
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,208
Let me help you up...

252
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,583
We should try to get outta here

253
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,333
while Krory's fighting
the Akuma, if you can stand.

254
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,041
He can handle himself...

255
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,916
Let's go.

256
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:09,833
The real Lenalee
would never agree

257
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,291
to abandon a friend
in need and run away,

258
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,875
so now we know for sure
that you're the fake one...!

259
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,125
Thanks!

260
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,541
Well, now we know
which one she is...

261
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,666
I must finish off this Akuma
quickly so we can find Lavi.

262
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,083
Silly boy, you should
pay closer attention!

263
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:29,958
Too late!

264
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,875
I've seen this before.

265
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,958
You fell for it!

266
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:41,875
Contrary to my appearance

267
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,250
I'm actually one of the
more intelligent Akuma...

268
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,791
in fact, you should
feel quite honored

269
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,291
to be killed by
the likes of me...

270
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,666
I assure you I don't look like

271
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,041
the smartest person
in the world either...

272
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,166
But I'm wondering
which one of us

273
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,958
has actually been
trapped in this scenario.

274
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,333
Are you aware of what I am?

275
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,666
And you... playing with people's
heads like this is unforgivable!

276
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,541
Now, you tell us who you are!

277
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,416
Where'd she go?!

278
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,500
It looks as though
she's gotten away.

279
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,333
I just wish I knew
who she was, and...

280
00:18:57,416 --> 00:19:00,083
...what she wanted with us.

281
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,958
Hey, Krory...

282
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,500
Yes... What is it?

283
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:14,000
Do you have any
idea where we are?

284
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,875
I'm so sorry.

285
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,458
Don't worry about it.

286
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,750
Have you heard from
Allen and Krory yet?

287
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,500
No, they haven't reported back.

288
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,375
You should go find
them... seriously.

289
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:32,166
Hey, we have to get
you healed first...

290
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,875
I say we go see Bookman...

291
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,291
We'll touch base
with Allen and Krory

292
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,125
and tell them to meet us there.

293
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,166
Okay... You're right...

294
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,750
I guess I would be a
burden to you like this.

295
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,125
Well, you know I'd never
think of you that way...

296
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,958
and I'm just as worried
about what's going on

297
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,208
with our friends as you are.

298
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,125
But for now...
we need to be sure...

299
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:57,625
that you're a hundred percent
when we see them again.

300
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,083
I'll let you get some sleep.

301
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,500
When we left that cave,

302
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,708
I didn't realize it was
just the first of many.

303
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,208
The unfortunate thing is that

304
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:24,791
we can't contact Lenalee and
Lavi from a place like this.

305
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:28,000
In the end, they
managed to separate us.

306
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,333
Krory, I can't help
but think that even though

307
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:34,083
we defeated the Akuma
we've still fallen into a trap.

308
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,833
What a disappointment...

309
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:43,458
We didn't even get to kill
that stupid vampire Exorcist.

310
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:47,041
I'm afraid killing them may
require more than one attempt...

311
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:50,041
But... we were at least
able to split them up

312
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,000
and that alone should
make our task easier.

313
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,333
Yes, that's true...!

314
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,333
So what do you
propose we try next...?

315
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,666
I know you have a plan!

316
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,500
Of course.

317
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,125
A stone statue is cherished

318
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:42,916
as the guardian angel
of a sleepy village...

319
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,791
Suddenly, it's come to life,

320
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,500
and is moving right
before our eyes...

321
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:50,208
On the next episode
of D.Gray-man:

322
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:52,666
"The Wandering Stone Statue."

323
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,125
Bring forth salvation to
this tormented Akuma's soul!
