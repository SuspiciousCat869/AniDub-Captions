WEBVTT

00:01:52.826 --> 00:01:54.128
Popp: Well, Dai...

00:01:54.161 --> 00:01:57.602
Things are looking pretty
bad here, aren't they?

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.544
Looks like.

00:02:01.577 --> 00:02:02.545
[struggling grunt]

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.517
Popp [thought]: It's no use.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.887
Even if I keep holding
off these flames,

00:02:06.921 --> 00:02:08.957
my stamina won't
last much longer...

00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:10.661
And with Dai's Aura
already spent,

00:02:10.695 --> 00:02:13.032
it's up to me to
get us out of here-

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.903
but my hands are
full as it is.

00:02:14.937 --> 00:02:16.740
Maybe our luck's run out.

00:02:16.774 --> 00:02:18.276
[struggling grunts]

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:21.984
Popp - hey!

00:02:22.017 --> 00:02:23.520
Popp: Sorry, pal.

00:02:23.554 --> 00:02:27.028
I jumped in here because
I thought this would work...

00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:29.666
I guess I bit off
more than I could chew.

00:02:31.403 --> 00:02:35.611
It looks like... this
might be... the end...

00:02:36.146 --> 00:02:37.648
But - no!

00:02:40.688 --> 00:02:41.957
Popp: I'm sorry.

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:47.636
Damnit!

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:50.908
[straining grunts]

00:02:50.942 --> 00:02:52.812
Hadlar: You gutless fools.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.751
H-Hadlar?

00:02:58.123 --> 00:02:59.893
Hadlar: How can you two...

00:02:59.926 --> 00:03:02.865
call yourselves
Disciples of Avan?

00:03:04.168 --> 00:03:05.070
Hadlar: Pathetic.

00:03:05.103 --> 00:03:06.272
To just close your eyes

00:03:06.306 --> 00:03:08.711
and accept your death
at a time like this...

00:03:08.745 --> 00:03:10.848
And claim... that
you're his pupils...

00:03:10.881 --> 00:03:12.886
Hadlar: How disappointed
your master will be

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.255
in the afterlife...

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:15.825
Who are you to say -

00:03:15.858 --> 00:03:17.361
Hadlar: Listen to me!

00:03:17.394 --> 00:03:18.964
Hadlar: I didn't give my life

00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:21.335
trying to defeat
a couple of cowards.

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:24.910
The Disciples of Avan I knew
had the hearts of lions.

00:03:24.943 --> 00:03:26.479
They were warriors of hope...

00:03:26.513 --> 00:03:29.385
and they thrived in
the face of adversity.

00:03:29.418 --> 00:03:32.725
Each of them carried an
iron will that never gave up,

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:34.630
no matter the odds.

00:03:34.663 --> 00:03:36.399
And hope...

00:03:36.432 --> 00:03:38.671
I-Isn't that supposed to be...

00:03:38.704 --> 00:03:42.979
the greatest of any weapon
in a Disciples arsenal?

00:03:45.117 --> 00:03:46.418
Hadlar...

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.691
That monster...

00:03:48.724 --> 00:03:51.730
If it weren't for him,
Avan would be here.

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:54.669
Popp [thought]: And yet...

00:03:54.702 --> 00:03:58.343
he just said exactly what
our Master would have.

00:03:58.377 --> 00:04:01.382
Now wield that hope of
yours and do something.

00:04:01.416 --> 00:04:05.524
I thought I was beaten by
the students of the old Hero.

00:04:05.558 --> 00:04:07.929
Don't you dare make
me into a fool...

00:04:07.963 --> 00:04:10.366
who lost to some
false warriors!

00:04:13.607 --> 00:04:16.547
Popp [thought]: Are we really
being lectured by our enemy?

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.053
We've gone head-to-head
with Hadlar so many times,

00:04:20.087 --> 00:04:21.690
he understands
what it means to be

00:04:21.724 --> 00:04:24.328
a student of
Avan more than we do.

00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:31.342
Popp: In that case, who cares
if this is the end of us...

00:04:31.375 --> 00:04:33.379
If this is where
we're going down,

00:04:33.412 --> 00:04:36.452
then we're gonna
go down fighting!

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.763
Popp: [roaring]

00:04:41.796 --> 00:04:43.366
Whoa, Popp...

00:04:48.342 --> 00:04:50.848
Popp [thought]: Okay.
Cool speech, but now what?

00:04:50.881 --> 00:04:53.554
A little extra magic
doesn't change the fact

00:04:53.588 --> 00:04:55.257
that we're out of options.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.528
It's not going to
help us escape.

00:05:02.104 --> 00:05:03.473
Hang on...

00:05:03.508 --> 00:05:05.377
I think there's a way out.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.780
You think so?

00:05:06.814 --> 00:05:10.655
Dai, you can still conjure
spells without your Aura, right?

00:05:10.688 --> 00:05:11.823
Probably...

00:05:11.857 --> 00:05:14.763
But in this state,
I don't know about my aim.

00:05:14.796 --> 00:05:17.535
Plus, my...
Magic Power isn't...

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:20.340
Popp: Don't worry. You won't
need to aim at anything.

00:05:20.374 --> 00:05:23.146
You only need
to cast one spell...

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:24.616
Popp: Zoom!

00:05:25.652 --> 00:05:27.188
Popp: Just point
it straight up

00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:29.593
and we'll fly out
the top of this thing.

00:05:29.626 --> 00:05:30.227
Got it?

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.429
Not really. If I miss...

00:05:31.462 --> 00:05:33.266
we'll crash into
a wall of flames!

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.472
Popp: That's where I come in.
I'll clear the way for you...

00:05:36.507 --> 00:05:39.044
with a little
help from my Medroa.

00:05:39.078 --> 00:05:40.280
That's it!

00:05:40.314 --> 00:05:42.618
Right! It's a long shot...

00:05:42.652 --> 00:05:45.089
But Medroa should
blow anything away.

00:05:46.492 --> 00:05:47.729
Popp: The way I figure,

00:05:47.762 --> 00:05:50.901
this trap is a massive
vortex created by focusing

00:05:50.935 --> 00:05:53.541
all the Underworld fire
into a single point...

00:05:53.574 --> 00:05:55.210
And that means, if I...

00:05:55.244 --> 00:05:57.180
can cast Medroa
directly above

00:05:57.214 --> 00:05:58.917
where the flames
are gathering...

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.458
it should be enough to punch
a hole right through them.

00:06:02.491 --> 00:06:05.430
It might only
last for an instant...

00:06:05.463 --> 00:06:07.935
And I say we take that shot.

00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:09.639
Okay.

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:14.014
But listen, when you see sky,
you have gotta cast that spell.

00:06:14.048 --> 00:06:17.187
Then I'll grab onto you
and we're in the clear.

00:06:17.221 --> 00:06:18.758
Casting Medroa
is probably going to

00:06:18.791 --> 00:06:21.229
drain me of all my
Magic Power, though...

00:06:21.262 --> 00:06:23.032
So this'll be our only chance.

00:06:25.203 --> 00:06:26.673
Right. It'll work.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.460
Hadlar: Well? What
are you waiting for?

00:06:37.494 --> 00:06:38.764
Hadlar: If there's a way,

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:42.337
then do it before
you're out of time.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.843
Don't hesitate on
my account...

00:06:44.876 --> 00:06:48.382
I'm doomed to crumble
to ashes either way.

00:06:48.416 --> 00:06:51.990
And you can't let this
opportunity pass you by.

00:06:52.024 --> 00:06:53.426
All right.

00:06:57.234 --> 00:06:58.704
Everybody!

00:06:59.305 --> 00:07:00.173
Popp...

00:07:01.342 --> 00:07:02.344
Popp: We're going to
take one last stab at

00:07:02.377 --> 00:07:03.547
breaking free of this.

00:07:03.581 --> 00:07:05.217
Cross your fingers, okay?

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.319
We will.

00:07:06.352 --> 00:07:07.955
[excited chirps]

00:07:10.427 --> 00:07:14.569
Here goes... nothing...

00:07:15.303 --> 00:07:17.976
[struggling grunt]

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:19.044
What's wrong?

00:07:22.217 --> 00:07:23.587
[roaring]

00:07:25.056 --> 00:07:26.092
Aw, man.

00:07:26.125 --> 00:07:28.831
If I let my Ice-type
magic weaken even a little,

00:07:28.864 --> 00:07:31.235
they'll be overpowered
by these flames...

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.609
No - come on!

00:07:34.642 --> 00:07:37.047
[straining grunts]

00:07:38.617 --> 00:07:40.053
Popp [thought]:
It's too much.

00:07:40.087 --> 00:07:44.261
I can't hold off this fire and
cast Medroa at the same time.

00:07:47.167 --> 00:07:48.469
I can't...

00:07:56.419 --> 00:07:58.824
[roaring]

00:07:59.392 --> 00:08:01.663
[howling]

00:08:05.538 --> 00:08:06.940
Dai [thought]: Wait,
is he really...

00:08:06.974 --> 00:08:09.111
Popp [thought]:
I don't believe it.

00:08:09.144 --> 00:08:14.623
[struggling growl]

00:08:14.656 --> 00:08:17.360
Hadlar - what do you
think you're doing?!

00:08:17.394 --> 00:08:21.670
Hadlar: Ignore me.
I'm doing as I wish.

00:08:21.704 --> 00:08:23.339
Now you have your chance.

00:08:23.373 --> 00:08:25.978
Don't you dare
let it go to waste!

00:08:26.011 --> 00:08:27.348
You don't mean -

00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:30.755
I've given up everything
for this fight...

00:08:30.788 --> 00:08:33.059
and I'm not about to
let that jester Killvearn

00:08:33.092 --> 00:08:36.132
spoil my efforts
with his party tricks.

00:08:36.165 --> 00:08:37.568
I may have lost,

00:08:37.601 --> 00:08:40.240
but I won't allow my
companions to be forgotten.

00:08:40.273 --> 00:08:43.514
And if our last stand
ends without any victors,

00:08:43.547 --> 00:08:45.016
then who will tell the world

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.855
about their
extraordinary sacrifice?

00:08:49.057 --> 00:08:51.563
Hadlar: It's
now or never, Popp.

00:08:51.597 --> 00:08:53.967
I've come back
from the dead...

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.940
Consider this
your lucky break!

00:08:59.445 --> 00:09:02.785
[roaring]

00:09:11.102 --> 00:09:12.638
Popp: Get ready, Dai...

00:09:12.671 --> 00:09:14.776
This is it...

00:09:14.809 --> 00:09:15.410
'Kay!

00:09:15.444 --> 00:09:16.479
[roaring]

00:09:16.513 --> 00:09:18.551
Do it! Now!

00:09:18.584 --> 00:09:20.954
Medroa!

00:09:38.422 --> 00:09:39.959
Dai [thought]:
It really worked!

00:09:39.992 --> 00:09:41.629
Popp [thought]:
There we go.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.437
There's your way out.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:46.606
Hurry, before I...

00:10:02.972 --> 00:10:04.241
Zoom!

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.289
[worried chirp]

00:10:30.561 --> 00:10:31.829
Hey, where...

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:34.434
Where did Popp go?

00:10:37.207 --> 00:10:38.342
He was...

00:10:38.375 --> 00:10:39.278
What happened?

00:10:39.311 --> 00:10:41.014
Dai, where is he?

00:10:51.402 --> 00:10:52.938
No, Popp!

00:10:54.407 --> 00:10:56.245
Popp: Maam? I...

00:10:56.278 --> 00:10:57.748
[defeated chuckle]

00:10:57.782 --> 00:10:59.919
I really messed up.

00:10:59.953 --> 00:11:03.492
This isn't how I wanted
it to end, but, well...

00:11:03.527 --> 00:11:04.795
I'm sorry.

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:07.802
Popp: I guess I won't...

00:11:07.835 --> 00:11:10.306
be seeing that future
with you after all.

00:11:12.578 --> 00:11:15.283
No... Popp!

00:11:15.317 --> 00:11:16.553
But, why?

00:11:16.587 --> 00:11:18.389
Dai: Popp!

00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:24.802
Killvearn: [devious chuckle]

00:11:24.836 --> 00:11:26.472
Isn't it beautiful?

00:11:26.506 --> 00:11:30.647
The Nine of Diamonds trap
has reached its final stage.

00:11:30.681 --> 00:11:33.319
So say your farewells,
little Mage.

00:11:33.352 --> 00:11:35.724
It won't be long now.

00:11:36.292 --> 00:11:37.629
Somebody...

00:11:37.662 --> 00:11:39.264
Help him...

00:11:42.004 --> 00:11:45.711
Anybody, please.
Do something!

00:11:45.745 --> 00:11:48.416
Killvearn: Ah, yes.
Here it comes.

00:11:48.449 --> 00:11:50.688
My favorite part of the show.

00:11:50.721 --> 00:11:53.960
All the fires converge
above the central diamond,

00:11:53.994 --> 00:11:56.265
and plunge back into
the Underworld...

00:11:56.298 --> 00:11:59.404
In their wake,
not even ashes remain.

00:11:59.438 --> 00:12:00.406
[chuckle]

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:04.447
A final flourish - even
better than fireworks.

00:12:04.481 --> 00:12:06.586
Vearn: You're in
a good mood...

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.224
considering the Hero
managed to escape.

00:12:09.258 --> 00:12:12.599
I have plenty more traps
to deal with him, Sire.

00:12:12.632 --> 00:12:15.236
There's one for every
card in the deck.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.342
The boy and his party are bound
to be lost in the shuffle.

00:12:18.375 --> 00:12:21.182
At any rate, we're quite
lucky to have caught

00:12:21.215 --> 00:12:23.987
this annoying little
brat on the first draw.

00:12:24.589 --> 00:12:26.092
You seem to hold the Mage

00:12:26.125 --> 00:12:28.964
in rather high regard
for a mere human.

00:12:28.997 --> 00:12:31.936
Killvearn: Ah, one mustn't
underestimate the humans.

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:35.678
Popp's potential for growth
is even greater than Dai's.

00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:37.548
With him taken care of,

00:12:37.582 --> 00:12:41.990
the rest of the Disciples will
never reach this inner sanctum.

00:12:42.023 --> 00:12:44.696
I'll pick them off one-by-one.

00:12:44.729 --> 00:12:47.568
Calls for a toast,
don't you agree?

00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:51.609
Killvearn: So cheers to our
success... and Popp's demise.

00:12:51.642 --> 00:12:53.245
Yeah, cheers!

00:13:04.435 --> 00:13:06.338
H-Hadlar?!

00:13:11.583 --> 00:13:13.319
Well, look at us...

00:13:13.353 --> 00:13:16.693
I guess you're getting... the
best of both worlds, aren't you?

00:13:16.726 --> 00:13:17.795
Hadlar: Don't be stupid.

00:13:17.828 --> 00:13:19.733
I won't watch
you accept defeat.

00:13:19.766 --> 00:13:21.736
Stand up and try again.

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:22.972
Try what?

00:13:23.005 --> 00:13:26.613
It's over. I'm out of
Magic Power and stamina...

00:13:26.646 --> 00:13:30.019
But at least...
I managed to save Dai.

00:13:30.053 --> 00:13:31.656
That's good enough for me.

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:33.994
Hadlar: Do you think
this is sacrifice?

00:13:34.028 --> 00:13:35.798
No, it's stupidity.

00:13:35.831 --> 00:13:36.833
If you hadn't hesitated,

00:13:36.867 --> 00:13:38.804
you could've escaped
alongside him.

00:13:38.837 --> 00:13:41.876
But instead, you've given
up your only chance

00:13:41.909 --> 00:13:43.479
and what for?

00:13:46.084 --> 00:13:49.925
I... I just froze
up when I saw you.

00:13:50.828 --> 00:13:52.932
I don't understand.

00:13:52.965 --> 00:13:54.736
Popp: I don't either,

00:13:54.769 --> 00:13:56.305
but when I saw
you giving everything

00:13:56.339 --> 00:13:59.277
you had left just to
help us survive...

00:13:59.311 --> 00:14:02.316
It didn't feel like you
were our enemy anymore.

00:14:04.487 --> 00:14:07.962
Popp: Maybe that was
stupidity, but either way...

00:14:07.995 --> 00:14:10.868
I knew you weren't
gonna make it.

00:14:10.901 --> 00:14:13.507
And, well, I just couldn't...

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.678
I couldn't leave you behind.

00:14:15.711 --> 00:14:19.184
I mean, look at you...

00:14:19.217 --> 00:14:21.857
Popp: Fighting to
defend your honor.

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:24.595
Standing by your friends...

00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:26.098
through everything.

00:14:26.132 --> 00:14:28.469
And when it came
to fighting us,

00:14:28.504 --> 00:14:32.778
you did everything you could to
make sure it was a fair fight...

00:14:32.811 --> 00:14:35.951
No matter what it
would cost you...

00:14:35.984 --> 00:14:42.865
How are you any different
from the five of us?

00:14:42.898 --> 00:14:44.869
We're the same, Hadlar.

00:14:44.902 --> 00:14:49.377
But, Popp... y-you...

00:14:49.411 --> 00:14:52.050
Popp: In that moment when I
saw you starting to crumble,

00:14:52.084 --> 00:14:54.087
something shifted in me...

00:14:54.121 --> 00:14:56.158
I couldn't bring
myself to look away.

00:14:56.191 --> 00:15:00.433
It was like a reflex -
I just reached out to you.

00:15:00.466 --> 00:15:01.235
Popp: And that's why...

00:15:01.268 --> 00:15:03.707
I couldn't grab
onto Dai in time.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:04.942
[chuckling]

00:15:04.976 --> 00:15:06.746
Now that is stupid, right?

00:15:06.779 --> 00:15:08.482
To give up my only
chance at survival

00:15:08.516 --> 00:15:12.124
because I wanted to
save our mortal enemy...

00:15:12.157 --> 00:15:13.860
When I get to the afterlife,

00:15:13.894 --> 00:15:16.164
Master Avan's gonna
give me an earful.

00:15:17.334 --> 00:15:19.839
On second thought,
he wouldn't blame me...

00:15:19.872 --> 00:15:22.043
He'd know exactly how I feel.

00:15:22.578 --> 00:15:25.049
Popp - why?!

00:15:33.365 --> 00:15:35.538
Popp: H-Hadlar?

00:15:35.571 --> 00:15:40.079
[mournful sobbing]

00:15:40.113 --> 00:15:43.385
Are you crying... over me?

00:15:44.454 --> 00:15:49.097
Hadlar: Popp, I...
I don't deserve your mercy.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.335
A-After everything
I've done...

00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:53.706
Everything I've
taken from you...

00:15:56.546 --> 00:15:58.282
Forgive me.

00:16:00.888 --> 00:16:03.292
No, I should thank you.

00:16:03.326 --> 00:16:07.133
If you hadn't been here,
I couldn't have cast Medroa.

00:16:08.871 --> 00:16:11.642
Popp: You helped me
save Dai, Hadlar.

00:16:14.047 --> 00:16:15.383
[grim chuckle]

00:16:15.416 --> 00:16:18.823
It's so hot in this thing,
you can't even cry properly.

00:16:18.857 --> 00:16:21.361
Not the best way to
go if you ask me.

00:16:21.394 --> 00:16:23.600
But at least we'll
go together...

00:16:24.768 --> 00:16:26.438
Master Avan, he'll be shocked.

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:36.158
Hadlar [thought]: Hear me...
oh, mighty God of Humanity.

00:16:36.192 --> 00:16:39.933
As a Darkling, this is
my first ever prayer...

00:16:39.966 --> 00:16:42.270
but if you truly preside

00:16:42.304 --> 00:16:45.042
over the lives of humans
as their legends tell,

00:16:45.075 --> 00:16:47.548
and if you have the
power, then please...

00:16:47.582 --> 00:16:49.051
Spare him.

00:16:49.084 --> 00:16:51.021
Spare this magnificent man-

00:16:51.055 --> 00:16:53.993
show him the same
mercy he showed me.

00:16:54.027 --> 00:16:56.365
Please don't let him
die for a monster;

00:16:56.398 --> 00:16:57.702
let him live.

00:16:57.735 --> 00:17:01.308
Send him a miracle.
I beg you.

00:17:01.342 --> 00:17:05.282
I beg you!

00:17:06.552 --> 00:17:09.926
Killvearn: Perfection.
And now, the grand finale.

00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:12.396
Burn away, you filthy mortals!

00:17:15.938 --> 00:17:17.675
He can't...

00:17:17.708 --> 00:17:19.612
Dai: He can't be gone...

00:17:20.848 --> 00:17:23.385
Come back!

00:17:39.685 --> 00:17:40.988
[gasps]

00:17:41.021 --> 00:17:42.256
[shocked chirp]

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.577
Maam: Is he...

00:17:55.717 --> 00:17:57.854
What in the... What is this?

00:17:59.023 --> 00:18:00.994
Avan: Now, Popp.
I'm all for surprises...

00:18:01.027 --> 00:18:04.300
But it's a little early for
you to head to the afterlife.

00:18:07.307 --> 00:18:08.977
Avan: And even if you had,

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:11.147
I wouldn't have been
waiting there for you.

00:18:13.954 --> 00:18:15.523
No way...

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:17.861
Is this a dream?

00:18:17.894 --> 00:18:21.334
It can't be. I thought that...

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:30.687
Impossible...

00:18:36.999 --> 00:18:39.370
Killvearn: H-How?

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:44.180
He was dead!

00:18:55.203 --> 00:18:57.206
M-Master... It's you.

00:18:58.844 --> 00:19:01.015
Popp [thought]:
It can't be...

00:19:01.048 --> 00:19:02.350
Either I'm seeing things...

00:19:02.383 --> 00:19:06.291
Or th-this... this
really is the afterlife.

00:19:17.581 --> 00:19:18.883
Yes, I'm here.

00:19:18.916 --> 00:19:21.922
It'll be a moment before
I heal you, though, Popp.

00:19:23.826 --> 00:19:26.265
Avan: And while we're on
the subject of surprises,

00:19:26.298 --> 00:19:28.837
it appears I owe you
a word of gratitude...

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:30.172
Hadlar.

00:19:30.205 --> 00:19:31.742
Unbelievable...

00:19:31.776 --> 00:19:33.111
It's really you, isn't it?

00:19:33.145 --> 00:19:35.584
After all this time.

00:19:35.617 --> 00:19:38.488
I have to admit,
I didn't expect that you,

00:19:38.523 --> 00:19:42.765
of all people, would end up
rescuing one of my students.

00:19:42.798 --> 00:19:43.766
Avan: The Hadlar I knew

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:47.173
would never even dream
of doing such a thing.

00:19:47.206 --> 00:19:49.110
However, I get the
sense that you've become

00:19:49.143 --> 00:19:51.549
a different man than
the one I once knew...

00:19:51.583 --> 00:19:55.189
And now the world is finally
rid of the Dark Lord.

00:19:55.222 --> 00:19:57.627
Why, you little...

00:19:57.661 --> 00:20:00.767
Avan: I know it's strange,
saying this to my old rival -

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.807
after so many years
and countless battles -

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:04.975
but truly...

00:20:05.008 --> 00:20:06.144
You old fool.

00:20:06.177 --> 00:20:09.083
Do you really intend
to thank me for this?!

00:20:09.117 --> 00:20:10.386
Hadlar: You're soft.

00:20:10.419 --> 00:20:13.092
You're still as
hopelessly soft as ever...

00:20:13.125 --> 00:20:14.762
And you... make me sick!

00:20:29.825 --> 00:20:31.529
Hadlar: But you
can't hide from me...

00:20:31.562 --> 00:20:34.635
And this time I won't give
you the chance to meddle...

00:20:36.004 --> 00:20:38.008
You spineless Reaper.

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:52.838
Yeesh. Good riddance,
Killvearn.

00:20:53.739 --> 00:20:54.808
Avan: Hadlar?

00:20:59.217 --> 00:21:00.820
Hadlar: Well, I suppose...

00:21:00.854 --> 00:21:03.893
that was truly the
last of my strength.

00:21:03.926 --> 00:21:07.233
A Superior Being can
never outrun it's fate.

00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:10.139
Hadlar... What's happening?

00:21:10.173 --> 00:21:12.477
Hadlar: Listen well, Avan.

00:21:12.511 --> 00:21:16.285
The Dark King Vearn is as
dangerous as they come.

00:21:16.318 --> 00:21:20.760
Be as cold as ice -
don't hold anything back.

00:21:20.794 --> 00:21:24.467
If you wish for your Disciples
to survive the battle ahead...

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.237
then you're going
to have to summon

00:21:26.271 --> 00:21:28.776
every ounce of your power.

00:21:29.211 --> 00:21:31.347
[gasping]

00:21:36.793 --> 00:21:40.299
And you know, for
whatever it's worth...

00:21:40.332 --> 00:21:43.873
These students of yours
made glorious adversaries.

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.044
So much so...

00:21:46.077 --> 00:21:48.583
that instead
of defeating me...

00:21:48.617 --> 00:21:51.822
they made me become
a better man.

00:21:53.325 --> 00:21:56.031
Hadlar: And with your power,
I have no doubt...

00:21:56.064 --> 00:21:57.500
that you'll lead them...

00:21:57.534 --> 00:22:00.272
to an equally
glorious victory.

00:22:00.306 --> 00:22:02.544
Hadlar...

00:22:02.577 --> 00:22:04.915
Hadlar: So, if you
want to show me...

00:22:04.948 --> 00:22:06.819
your gratitude...

00:22:06.852 --> 00:22:09.925
Then that's the best
way for you to do it.

00:22:16.972 --> 00:22:18.375
Popp: Hadlar...

00:22:19.043 --> 00:22:20.680
Hadlar: Popp.

00:22:20.713 --> 00:22:22.685
It seems that your
God of Humanity

00:22:22.718 --> 00:22:24.655
has a remarkably
poetic sense of irony...

00:22:24.689 --> 00:22:27.828
But not without a
certain kind of fairness.

00:22:27.862 --> 00:22:28.863
Huh?

00:22:30.465 --> 00:22:34.140
It's rather fitting that
in exchange for my life...

00:22:34.174 --> 00:22:36.445
your god has
returned the treasure

00:22:36.478 --> 00:22:39.518
I once stole
from the world...

00:22:39.551 --> 00:22:41.622
and granted
you with a miracle,

00:22:41.656 --> 00:22:44.060
right when you
needed one most.

00:22:45.898 --> 00:22:48.468
And not only that...

00:22:49.605 --> 00:22:53.713
Your god was
generous enough...

00:22:53.746 --> 00:22:56.484
to let me die right here...

00:22:56.518 --> 00:22:57.821
in the arms...

00:22:57.854 --> 00:23:02.564
of one of the greatest men
this realm has ever known.

00:23:10.413 --> 00:23:11.883
Popp [thought]: Hadlar...

00:23:11.916 --> 00:23:15.089
I hope you know that
in your last moments,

00:23:15.122 --> 00:23:17.994
you became one of us.

00:23:18.028 --> 00:23:20.333
You were our friend,

00:23:20.366 --> 00:23:22.202
and we'll remember you.

00:23:23.707 --> 00:23:25.075
Farewell.

00:23:37.133 --> 00:23:38.168
Narrator:
With Hadlar's demise

00:23:38.201 --> 00:23:39.872
and Avan's miraculous return,

00:23:39.906 --> 00:23:43.746
Dai and his companions are as
overjoyed as they are baffled.

00:23:43.779 --> 00:23:45.783
But the battle rages on below,

00:23:45.817 --> 00:23:47.353
and the siege
against Vearn Palace

00:23:47.386 --> 00:23:49.023
has lost its
element of surprise,

00:23:49.057 --> 00:23:51.863
so there's no time to waste
to get on the offensive.

00:23:51.896 --> 00:23:54.535
Together with the greatest
ally they could hope for,

00:23:54.568 --> 00:23:57.507
the Disciples of Avan head
once more into the breach.

00:23:57.541 --> 00:23:59.244
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:59.277 --> 00:24:01.448
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:01.481 --> 00:24:03.753
"Return of the Great Hero".
