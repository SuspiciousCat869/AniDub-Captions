WEBVTT

00:01:54.562 --> 00:01:55.631
King... Gaze!

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.783
[chuckling]

00:02:04.816 --> 00:02:07.454
Ah, yes. Perfect.

00:02:07.488 --> 00:02:10.193
Your little skirmish with
my missing piece has left you

00:02:10.227 --> 00:02:12.330
so weakened that
I should be able to

00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:15.170
do away with you in
a single blow.

00:02:16.573 --> 00:02:17.475
Before you try,

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:20.313
you've taken a great
amount of damage...

00:02:20.347 --> 00:02:23.654
You'll find even the greatest
Healing magic ineffective.

00:02:23.688 --> 00:02:27.762
Just a nudge from one of
my pawns, and it's all over.

00:02:27.796 --> 00:02:31.169
I should warn you, I won't be
fooled by your paltry wit.

00:02:31.203 --> 00:02:34.274
I will see through
any sleight of hand.

00:02:34.308 --> 00:02:36.312
I've studied all
of your tactics.

00:02:36.346 --> 00:02:38.651
The Heyedras have
recorded every strategy...

00:02:38.685 --> 00:02:40.821
every skill that you and
your friends have used

00:02:40.855 --> 00:02:45.063
to battle the Dark Army - and
that data lives inside my head.

00:02:45.096 --> 00:02:47.635
You'll never take
me by surprise...

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:51.242
So accept your fate.
There's no point in resisting!

00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:53.413
Before we start,
I have a question.

00:02:53.814 --> 00:02:55.017
What, pray tell?

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.323
I'll have you know, I won't
accept any pleas for your life.

00:02:58.356 --> 00:03:00.127
Oh, it's nothing like that.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.131
You called yourself
the palace's greatest,

00:03:02.164 --> 00:03:03.768
most terrifying guardian...

00:03:03.801 --> 00:03:06.807
If that's true, why aren't
you guarding your king?

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.676
[scoff]

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.014
I wouldn't expect
you to comprehend.

00:03:10.047 --> 00:03:11.315
It's beyond your vision.

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:12.786
A simple warrior like you

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.190
sees no further than
the battle at hand.

00:03:15.223 --> 00:03:16.727
The answer is simple:

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.036
You see, the word "defeat" does
not exist in my vocabulary.

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:22.505
Now...

00:03:24.208 --> 00:03:25.678
Allow me to educate you:

00:03:25.711 --> 00:03:28.049
Thinning out your
enemy's numbers...

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:32.324
by picking off the weak and the
wounded is an essential tactic.

00:03:32.358 --> 00:03:34.228
After all, one should
only engage in battle

00:03:34.262 --> 00:03:36.600
if victory can
be assured, yes?

00:03:36.634 --> 00:03:39.773
My army has never failed
to assure just that...

00:03:39.806 --> 00:03:40.875
and once I deploy them,

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:44.115
they won't stop until
they've ground you to dust.

00:03:44.148 --> 00:03:45.885
"To fight means to win!"

00:03:45.918 --> 00:03:50.093
That's the motto we follow.
King Vearn needs no protection.

00:03:50.126 --> 00:03:51.563
Maximum: At this very moment,

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:55.370
Mystvearn is facing off against
the Hero and the rest his party.

00:03:55.403 --> 00:03:57.609
First I'll dispose
of you weaklings,

00:03:57.642 --> 00:03:59.780
then once the specter
has worn them out,

00:03:59.813 --> 00:04:02.885
I'll head inside and
finish off your companions.

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:06.359
If I do that, I'll get
the credit for snuffing out

00:04:06.392 --> 00:04:09.699
every last one of the
illustrious Disciples of Avan.

00:04:09.732 --> 00:04:11.870
Hym [thought]:
What a scoundrel.

00:04:11.903 --> 00:04:13.574
Have I cleared that up for you?

00:04:13.607 --> 00:04:16.613
The only thing you
can do now... is die.

00:04:16.646 --> 00:04:19.719
Actually, perhaps I
should allow Mystvearn

00:04:19.753 --> 00:04:22.157
to struggle with your
friends a little longer.

00:04:22.191 --> 00:04:25.531
He always looks down on me and
calls me the palace "Janitor".

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:28.570
A touch of hardship may teach
him to have some respect.

00:04:28.604 --> 00:04:32.945
They do say that failure is the
greatest teacher for a reason...

00:04:35.818 --> 00:04:38.824
The Janitor of Vearn Palace,
huh? And who's that?

00:04:38.857 --> 00:04:40.594
Mystvearn: King
Vearn's favorite pet.

00:04:40.628 --> 00:04:43.968
A metallic life form born from
an Orichalcum chess piece.

00:04:44.001 --> 00:04:44.836
Oh yeah?

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:45.972
That's a shame,

00:04:46.005 --> 00:04:48.376
'cause if you're talking
about the Hadlar Royal Guard,

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:51.415
I've got bad news, pal.
We already defeated them all.

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:52.886
Mystvearn: Clearly
you've never counted

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.758
how many pieces there
are on a chessboard.

00:04:55.791 --> 00:04:58.597
Tell me, have you done
battle with the king yet?

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.369
Sure... I mean,
Hadlar was their king...

00:05:01.402 --> 00:05:03.473
No, Hadlar wasn't
a chess piece.

00:05:03.507 --> 00:05:04.576
Maam: If it's not him,

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.446
it only makes sense
that the real king

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:07.849
is still out there somewhere.

00:05:07.882 --> 00:05:10.755
Besides, there are
two kings on the board.

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:11.590
So you're saying...

00:05:11.624 --> 00:05:13.193
There are more
Orichalcum Warriors

00:05:13.226 --> 00:05:15.598
for us to face beyond
the Royal Guard?

00:05:15.632 --> 00:05:17.535
Mystvearn: Indeed.
Although, they lack

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:20.575
the individual wills Hadlar
granted his soldiers.

00:05:20.608 --> 00:05:23.915
Only the king, Maximum,
was born with such a gift.

00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:26.385
His will controls
the remaining pieces...

00:05:26.418 --> 00:05:28.089
And it appears as
if his highness

00:05:28.123 --> 00:05:30.928
has finally decided
to make a move.

00:05:34.034 --> 00:05:35.504
Now I can see it.

00:05:37.074 --> 00:05:39.378
You are beyond help...

00:05:39.412 --> 00:05:42.050
and you're not worth
leaving alive!

00:05:43.788 --> 00:05:45.825
[cackling]

00:05:45.859 --> 00:05:48.196
This is why I love
dealing with the wounded.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:49.666
They're delusional.

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:52.371
If it makes this easier,
I won't stop you.

00:05:52.404 --> 00:05:55.476
In fact, we could even
make a game of it.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.098
On that note, I believe I
shall take the first move!

00:06:14.282 --> 00:06:16.920
Maximum: [cackling]

00:06:17.321 --> 00:06:18.724
Beautiful.

00:06:18.757 --> 00:06:22.665
A quick rush of my pawns and
this pest is already finished.

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:25.771
Maximum: Fall back, troops!

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.917
You there, what's wrong?

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.954
I told you to fall back.

00:06:44.942 --> 00:06:46.780
Wh... What?! No!

00:06:46.813 --> 00:06:49.987
He shattered Orichalcum
with his bare fist?!

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.959
Hym [thought]: Incredible.
He actually did it.

00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:57.903
They're different.

00:06:57.936 --> 00:06:58.804
Huh?!

00:06:58.837 --> 00:07:01.142
Hyunckel: Now it's
just as I thought.

00:07:01.175 --> 00:07:02.712
Your soldiers?

00:07:02.745 --> 00:07:05.685
They're like paper
compared to Hym.

00:07:05.718 --> 00:07:08.190
I've had about enough
of your babbling.

00:07:08.223 --> 00:07:10.494
Knight! Take him out!

00:07:10.528 --> 00:07:12.798
Hyunckel: And you
aren't Sigma, either.

00:07:18.276 --> 00:07:19.746
H-How?

00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:23.119
Hadlar's Royal Guard
were superior.

00:07:23.153 --> 00:07:27.728
Hym, Sigma, Albinass,
Fenbren, and Block...

00:07:27.762 --> 00:07:29.666
They were great
warriors because

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:31.569
they each had a
will of their own.

00:07:31.603 --> 00:07:34.175
They drew power from
their loyalty...

00:07:34.208 --> 00:07:38.617
And were willing to sacrifice
themselves for their master.

00:07:38.651 --> 00:07:42.157
But your servants are
nothing but pieces of metal.

00:07:43.059 --> 00:07:44.696
Empty and weak!

00:07:49.238 --> 00:07:50.473
Hym [thought]: H-Hyunckel...

00:07:51.241 --> 00:07:53.980
You... You arrogant little...

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.920
King Gaze!

00:07:57.855 --> 00:08:01.797
Maximum: S-See?
You're barely even standing.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.636
In this state, a mere gust
of wind could take you down.

00:08:04.669 --> 00:08:06.640
You might have gotten
lucky before...

00:08:06.673 --> 00:08:09.579
But luck has a way
of running out.

00:08:09.613 --> 00:08:10.781
Finish him, Bishop.

00:08:10.815 --> 00:08:13.520
All it takes is
one sure strike!

00:08:16.258 --> 00:08:18.563
Yes! I've done it!

00:08:23.105 --> 00:08:24.609
[frustrated roar]

00:08:28.817 --> 00:08:31.623
Maximum: No... This...
This is impossible.

00:08:31.656 --> 00:08:33.326
Hyunckel: The fire
of my life force

00:08:33.359 --> 00:08:35.564
may be little more
than embers...

00:08:35.597 --> 00:08:38.537
But it won't be
extinguished by your drones.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.574
I guarantee it.

00:08:40.608 --> 00:08:43.113
Dammit! Go on, Rook.

00:08:43.146 --> 00:08:45.249
Squash this nuisance.

00:08:54.368 --> 00:08:55.738
Hyunckel: Same problem...

00:09:04.989 --> 00:09:06.794
You're all hollow.

00:09:06.827 --> 00:09:09.398
Maximum: P-P-P-Pawns...

00:09:09.432 --> 00:09:11.936
Don't just stand
there! Rush him!

00:09:35.584 --> 00:09:38.422
[shocked gasp]

00:09:38.455 --> 00:09:39.825
Maximum [thought]:
Unbelievable.

00:09:39.859 --> 00:09:43.767
It's still there! That one last
health point won't budge!

00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:46.238
B-But... But it
doesn't make sense.

00:09:46.272 --> 00:09:49.879
All it should take to deplete
it is a measly scratch...

00:09:49.913 --> 00:09:50.882
So how...

00:09:50.915 --> 00:09:54.956
how is he able to
withstand these attacks?

00:09:54.989 --> 00:09:56.659
Maximum [thought]:
A-According to my database,

00:09:56.693 --> 00:09:59.331
the Dark Swordsman
Hyunckel's immortality is

00:09:59.365 --> 00:10:00.734
nothing more than a rumor.

00:10:00.768 --> 00:10:03.206
He may be a cunning and
highly-skilled warrior,

00:10:03.239 --> 00:10:07.414
but he's still a human - a
creature of flesh and bone.

00:10:07.448 --> 00:10:09.184
Let me take a closer look.

00:10:10.119 --> 00:10:14.194
Super... Gaze!

00:10:15.263 --> 00:10:17.201
Maximum [thought]:
Yes, there's the damage!

00:10:17.234 --> 00:10:20.541
I knew that nobody could
shatter Orichalcum barehanded

00:10:20.575 --> 00:10:22.011
without paying the price.

00:10:22.044 --> 00:10:26.285
He's broken - beyond
all hope of healing.

00:10:26.318 --> 00:10:28.489
T-Then how can it be...

00:10:28.523 --> 00:10:33.767
How can he possibly still
be able to move like this?!

00:10:37.675 --> 00:10:39.344
Hym [thought]:
It's unbelievable.

00:10:39.378 --> 00:10:40.848
The power driving Hyunckel

00:10:40.881 --> 00:10:43.820
has pushed him beyond the
limits of his mortal form.

00:10:43.854 --> 00:10:46.492
There's no denying it now.

00:10:46.526 --> 00:10:49.899
That's Fortitude
if I've ever seen it.

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:51.803
[fuming]

00:10:51.836 --> 00:10:54.742
Maximum [thought]: I still
have five pawns remaining.

00:10:54.776 --> 00:10:56.478
Together, they
should be enough

00:10:56.512 --> 00:10:58.717
to drain the last
of his energy...

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:02.357
But I have to admit, I see
how the rumor started.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:03.827
He does seem like
he possesses

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.567
some kind of
supernatural power.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.435
My next...
My next order is...

00:11:09.739 --> 00:11:11.108
All of you, fall back.

00:11:11.142 --> 00:11:13.980
Fall back and guard
your mighty king.

00:11:16.553 --> 00:11:17.722
He's gone...

00:11:17.755 --> 00:11:18.990
He vanished?!

00:11:19.024 --> 00:11:21.763
No... Where? Where is he?!

00:11:21.796 --> 00:11:24.769
Hyunckel: Right here. Check.

00:11:32.251 --> 00:11:34.789
[roaring]

00:11:48.951 --> 00:11:50.854
Your pawns are mere puppets.

00:11:50.888 --> 00:11:52.457
They only move
at your command,

00:11:52.491 --> 00:11:55.363
so if I catch you off-guard,
I catch them off-guard.

00:11:55.397 --> 00:11:58.737
You really are like the king
on a chessboard, aren't you?

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.643
Your tactical mind is
your only real advantage.

00:12:01.676 --> 00:12:03.914
All you do is order
the other pieces around.

00:12:03.947 --> 00:12:05.550
But you're also the weakest.

00:12:05.584 --> 00:12:06.887
Once your troops
start to fall...

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.122
You're vulnerable.

00:12:09.124 --> 00:12:11.027
From there, it's just a
matter of cornering you.

00:12:11.061 --> 00:12:14.234
And if you ask me, it looks
like you're in a tight spot.

00:12:14.267 --> 00:12:15.738
You can brag about
your strength,

00:12:15.771 --> 00:12:17.842
but if you had any
real power at all,

00:12:17.875 --> 00:12:19.546
then you wouldn't
have to call back

00:12:19.579 --> 00:12:22.050
your troops to
defend you like this.

00:12:23.953 --> 00:12:25.824
Hyunckel: In which
case, Maximum,

00:12:25.858 --> 00:12:27.762
I think that's checkmate.

00:12:27.795 --> 00:12:29.364
Hym [thought]: He's won!

00:12:48.002 --> 00:12:50.440
Maximum: King Access!

00:12:50.473 --> 00:12:51.408
Maximum [thought]:
He's right.

00:12:51.441 --> 00:12:54.247
I can control my pawns
with just a finger,

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:58.322
but if he's too fast for me,
they won't be of much use.

00:12:58.355 --> 00:13:00.260
Now that he's
discovered my weakness,

00:13:00.293 --> 00:13:02.331
I'll just have to
return the favor.

00:13:02.364 --> 00:13:03.833
Ah-ha...

00:13:06.907 --> 00:13:10.012
Hyunckel! Hurry.
Finish them off!

00:13:11.181 --> 00:13:12.316
Hyunckel: Hym!

00:13:13.753 --> 00:13:16.058
Don't you dare...

00:13:18.797 --> 00:13:20.901
No! Let go of me!

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:26.445
[falling yell]

00:13:34.996 --> 00:13:36.398
What is wrong with you?!

00:13:36.432 --> 00:13:37.334
You should've let me fall.

00:13:37.367 --> 00:13:39.438
You're leaving yourself
wide open here!

00:13:39.471 --> 00:13:41.041
I didn't have a choice.

00:13:41.075 --> 00:13:42.778
We both know how
injured you are.

00:13:42.812 --> 00:13:44.649
The impact from
a fall like this...

00:13:44.682 --> 00:13:46.986
You wouldn't survive it.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.556
Maximum: Precisely!

00:13:49.859 --> 00:13:52.331
Now who's cornered,
Dark Swordsman?

00:13:52.364 --> 00:13:54.736
You can't do anything!

00:13:54.769 --> 00:13:55.771
[pained roar]

00:13:55.804 --> 00:13:58.510
That's enough!
You have to let me go.

00:13:58.543 --> 00:14:00.748
He just told you - he can't.

00:14:00.781 --> 00:14:02.885
Maximum: I've
analyzed the data.

00:14:02.918 --> 00:14:04.789
Even when things get
desperate,

00:14:04.822 --> 00:14:07.226
this man can never
summon the guts needed

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:11.034
to sacrifice his friends in
order to assure his victory.

00:14:11.068 --> 00:14:14.241
Even if the alternative is
certain death for both of you,

00:14:14.274 --> 00:14:18.717
he's still too cowardly to
choose his own survival.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:22.792
I'm afraid it's in his nature.
He's just that kind of fool.

00:14:22.825 --> 00:14:24.427
Hym [thought]:
What? You mean...

00:14:24.461 --> 00:14:26.498
he considers me a friend?

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:27.935
Sentiment.

00:14:27.969 --> 00:14:31.308
It's a fatal weakness
to find in a warrior.

00:14:31.341 --> 00:14:33.179
When you were
heartless and fierce,

00:14:33.212 --> 00:14:34.949
you might have stood a chance,

00:14:34.982 --> 00:14:36.452
but all that
compassion and love

00:14:36.485 --> 00:14:37.988
you've been getting
from your friends...

00:14:38.022 --> 00:14:40.193
it's starting to
make you soft.

00:14:40.226 --> 00:14:44.467
Now why don't we find out
how immortal you really are?

00:14:45.805 --> 00:14:47.040
Hyunckel [thought]: Love?

00:14:47.073 --> 00:14:48.743
The fact that I discovered
your weakness so easily

00:14:48.777 --> 00:14:50.781
is proof of my
superior intellect.

00:14:50.815 --> 00:14:54.254
Super-Superior,
you might say.

00:14:54.923 --> 00:14:56.258
Maximum: [cackling]

00:14:56.291 --> 00:14:58.763
Hyunckel [thought]: That's
right... How did I miss it?

00:14:58.797 --> 00:15:02.037
I... I'm doing the
same thing Maam did.

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:05.577
I didn't think I...
was capable of that...

00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:09.952
Please, let me go.

00:15:09.985 --> 00:15:11.623
I'm sorry, Hym.

00:15:11.656 --> 00:15:15.030
I was hoping somehow I
could at least save you...

00:15:15.063 --> 00:15:17.668
Doesn't look like...
I have the strength.

00:15:18.636 --> 00:15:19.805
But know this:

00:15:19.839 --> 00:15:22.979
If I'm going to lose because
of my compassion or love...

00:15:23.012 --> 00:15:26.117
that's a loss...
that I'll proudly accept.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.026
Don't be an idiot! No!

00:15:30.059 --> 00:15:32.331
I happen to agree
with that assessment.

00:15:32.364 --> 00:15:35.369
He's as daft as a rook
moving on a slant.

00:15:35.402 --> 00:15:38.375
Now I shall take that last
health point of yours...

00:15:38.408 --> 00:15:41.448
and then I'll go find
the rest of your friends.

00:15:42.584 --> 00:15:43.787
Oh, by the way.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.893
My fist is far
greater than any pawns.

00:15:46.927 --> 00:15:49.264
It's time to
turn you into a pulp.

00:15:49.297 --> 00:15:52.136
This is what I call checkmate.

00:16:00.587 --> 00:16:01.689
Maximum [thought]: What?

00:16:04.394 --> 00:16:06.633
[pained roars]

00:16:06.666 --> 00:16:08.503
What kind of spear is this?

00:16:08.536 --> 00:16:09.572
Wh-Who dares?!

00:16:09.605 --> 00:16:13.078
Show yourself. Answer for
such petty insolence!

00:16:13.112 --> 00:16:15.182
Larhart: "Petty
insolence" huh?

00:16:17.353 --> 00:16:20.493
Larhart: And here I was,
trying to be polite.

00:16:20.527 --> 00:16:22.999
See, whenever I cross
paths with scumbags

00:16:23.032 --> 00:16:24.636
who fight without
any honor...

00:16:24.669 --> 00:16:29.244
I make a point of introducing
them to my Dark Spear.

00:16:29.277 --> 00:16:33.319
Is that so? And who
the heck are you anyway?

00:16:33.352 --> 00:16:35.624
Larhart: I'm your
punishment...

00:16:38.062 --> 00:16:41.536
You can call me Larhart,
the Land Rider.

00:16:42.872 --> 00:16:44.808
T-The L-Land Rider?!

00:16:44.842 --> 00:16:47.346
Hyunckel [thought]:
Larhart's alive?

00:16:52.525 --> 00:16:55.329
Who is that?
You know this warrior?

00:16:55.363 --> 00:16:57.735
I thought I'd never
see him again.

00:16:57.768 --> 00:17:01.108
It seems miracles
come in pairs.

00:17:01.141 --> 00:17:03.680
Master Avan's return
was the first of them,

00:17:03.713 --> 00:17:05.116
and now Larhart...

00:17:05.149 --> 00:17:07.387
Another escapee of
the afterlife.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.491
My greatest rival,
and the friend...

00:17:09.526 --> 00:17:12.030
whose will I've vowed
to carry as my own...

00:17:12.063 --> 00:17:14.802
Today, the gods
truly smile on us.

00:17:15.504 --> 00:17:17.541
Access!

00:17:18.242 --> 00:17:19.277
Maximum [thought]: Larhart...

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:21.683
A former soldier
for the Dragon Legion

00:17:21.716 --> 00:17:23.586
and one of the Dragon Masters.

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:25.122
He's a maverick in combat.

00:17:25.156 --> 00:17:27.995
The original owner of
the Dark Armor Spear.

00:17:28.029 --> 00:17:29.965
According to the
Heyedra records,

00:17:29.999 --> 00:17:32.170
he was destroyed in
a fight against

00:17:32.203 --> 00:17:34.374
the Hero's party near Teran.

00:17:34.407 --> 00:17:36.411
My, you're a wandering soul.

00:17:36.444 --> 00:17:38.148
You appear to have
lost your way.

00:17:38.181 --> 00:17:39.585
But no matter.

00:17:39.619 --> 00:17:42.692
If you wish to fight,
I have your data on file...

00:17:42.725 --> 00:17:45.496
My magnificent mind
can read all of it!

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:48.904
I know your past, and I
can predict your future...

00:17:48.937 --> 00:17:50.305
Maximum: Not to mention,

00:17:50.339 --> 00:17:53.012
I've already learned each and
every one of your attacks.

00:17:53.045 --> 00:17:55.817
Oh? Well, that's
rather impressive.

00:17:55.851 --> 00:17:57.721
What else does
your data tell you?

00:17:57.755 --> 00:18:00.961
Supposedly, you possess
unparalleled speed...

00:18:00.994 --> 00:18:03.733
Your greatest attack
is your Sunder Claw.

00:18:03.766 --> 00:18:05.235
I like the sound of that one.

00:18:05.269 --> 00:18:07.340
But you're no match
empty-handed.

00:18:07.373 --> 00:18:10.981
That means your only strategic
option is to evade me.

00:18:11.014 --> 00:18:13.151
Maximum: And I have ways
to counter that...

00:18:22.103 --> 00:18:27.246
[trembling]

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.449
How's he that fast?

00:18:28.482 --> 00:18:30.352
I hate to break it
to you, Hym...

00:18:30.386 --> 00:18:32.558
But no matter
how fast you may be,

00:18:32.591 --> 00:18:35.897
there's always somebody
faster out there.

00:18:35.931 --> 00:18:38.570
Well, then. What do
you say, King?

00:18:38.603 --> 00:18:42.143
Does my speed live up to
what your data suggested?

00:18:43.345 --> 00:18:44.815
Larhart: If simply
knowing that I'm fast

00:18:44.848 --> 00:18:47.955
was enough for you to win,
this would be too easy.

00:18:47.988 --> 00:18:49.257
I suppose that's
the difference...

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.461
between knowledge
and ability...

00:18:51.495 --> 00:18:53.232
Whatever you've got on me,

00:18:53.265 --> 00:18:55.369
it's probably
useless in your hands.

00:18:56.806 --> 00:18:57.440
Attack!

00:18:57.474 --> 00:18:59.477
Don't give him any mercy.

00:19:00.112 --> 00:19:01.749
You don't believe me?

00:19:01.782 --> 00:19:03.452
In that case...

00:19:03.485 --> 00:19:06.458
Let me show you for
posterity's sake...

00:19:09.031 --> 00:19:11.167
A taste of my
greatest attack.

00:19:11.936 --> 00:19:12.905
Here it comes!

00:19:12.938 --> 00:19:15.543
Sunder... Claw!

00:19:58.295 --> 00:19:59.398
Very well!

00:19:59.431 --> 00:20:01.401
I'll allow you to take
the victory today,

00:20:01.435 --> 00:20:04.474
but when we fight again,
I won't be so generous.

00:20:04.508 --> 00:20:08.082
You'll pay dearly when you
face my army's full force.

00:20:08.115 --> 00:20:09.283
Mark these words.

00:20:09.317 --> 00:20:11.522
The next time we meet
will be the end of you.

00:20:11.556 --> 00:20:13.459
Larhart: There won't
be a next time.

00:20:13.492 --> 00:20:15.997
If you take one step
from where you stand,

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:18.402
I promise it'll be your last.

00:20:18.435 --> 00:20:21.509
You have a smart mouth,
but you don't threaten me.

00:20:21.542 --> 00:20:24.047
It's your words that
are truly hollow, my boy.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.018
[chuckling]

00:20:26.051 --> 00:20:29.457
Come on. Did you really
fail to see it?

00:20:29.491 --> 00:20:31.629
Hym: You're lucky you
didn't shatter on the spot.

00:20:31.663 --> 00:20:35.504
He just ran you through with an
unbelievable amount of speed.

00:20:35.537 --> 00:20:36.639
What?!

00:20:39.512 --> 00:20:41.281
Maximum: I don't
feel anything.

00:20:41.314 --> 00:20:43.052
No, it's clearly
some sort of ruse.

00:20:43.085 --> 00:20:45.355
You're trying to
trick me, aren't you?

00:20:46.091 --> 00:20:47.661
King Access!

00:20:53.004 --> 00:20:54.341
It's so obvious.

00:20:54.374 --> 00:20:57.146
You're using a mind game
to keep me in place.

00:20:57.179 --> 00:20:59.484
But your harebrained
scheme doesn't fool me.

00:20:59.518 --> 00:21:02.591
It's just as I said:
I see right through it.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.064
And now, farewell.

00:21:06.098 --> 00:21:08.068
Until we meet again!

00:21:12.076 --> 00:21:13.345
Oh, dear...

00:21:18.923 --> 00:21:21.361
An end fit for a king.

00:21:21.395 --> 00:21:23.966
You really reap
what you sow.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.073
For someone with such
a superior intellect...

00:21:27.106 --> 00:21:28.576
not so bright.

00:21:30.245 --> 00:21:31.716
Miracles come in
threes, it seems -

00:21:31.749 --> 00:21:34.755
I could've been
one of his pawns.

00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:38.161
Being born to serve Lord
Hadlar was a stroke of luck.

00:21:38.195 --> 00:21:39.632
That's one-in-eight odds.

00:21:39.665 --> 00:21:41.602
I wouldn't have bet on that.

00:21:50.019 --> 00:21:51.254
Hym [thought]:
In any case...

00:21:51.288 --> 00:21:54.428
Who is this Larhart
guy? What is he?

00:21:54.461 --> 00:21:55.697
And more importantly,

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:58.335
what could've happened
between him and Hyunckel?

00:23:37.734 --> 00:23:39.270
Narrator: After saving
Hyunckel and Hym,

00:23:39.304 --> 00:23:42.510
the mighty Land Rider Larhart
dons his Dark Armor Spear

00:23:42.544 --> 00:23:44.915
and storms the castle to
help Dai and the others.

00:23:44.948 --> 00:23:46.686
Meanwhile, in
the White Garden,

00:23:46.719 --> 00:23:49.490
the stage is set for a
confrontation with Mystvearn -

00:23:49.525 --> 00:23:51.896
the greatest enemy in
the Dark Army's ranks.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.333
With another adversary
lurking in the shadows,

00:23:54.366 --> 00:23:55.837
can Avan and his
disciples fend off

00:23:55.871 --> 00:23:58.408
their attackers long enough
for Larhart to arrive?

00:23:58.441 --> 00:23:59.912

the next episode of

00:23:59.945 --> 00:24:01.782

the White Garden".
