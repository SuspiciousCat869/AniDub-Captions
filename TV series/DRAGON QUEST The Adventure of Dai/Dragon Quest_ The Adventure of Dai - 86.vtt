WEBVTT

00:01:50.554 --> 00:01:53.192
Calamitous Wall!

00:02:04.983 --> 00:02:06.286
Well, this is it.

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.158
Dai's got all of his attention
focused on the fight...

00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:11.362
And... now he's
got two Dragon Crests.

00:02:11.396 --> 00:02:13.267
But is it really
too much to ask

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.239
that little guy to
watch where he's aiming?

00:02:16.272 --> 00:02:18.911
Vearn: In all my years,
no adversary has ever thought

00:02:18.944 --> 00:02:22.819
to overcome my Calamitous Wall
by mimicking its energy.

00:02:22.852 --> 00:02:26.727
Not bad, Dai. Not bad at all.

00:02:26.761 --> 00:02:28.029
Oh, I didn't think of it.

00:02:28.063 --> 00:02:31.704
It's like my body already knew
what to do before I could react.

00:02:31.737 --> 00:02:32.906
To tell you the truth,

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:34.509
I had no clue that
my Draconic Aura

00:02:34.543 --> 00:02:37.414
could even do
something like that.

00:02:37.448 --> 00:02:39.351
Dai [thought]: But now that
I'm thinking about it...

00:02:39.385 --> 00:02:41.957
the same thing happened
when I used my Doruora.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.026
It was instinct.

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:44.295
Once I stopped
overthinking the fight,

00:02:44.328 --> 00:02:45.998
it just sort of came to me.

00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:47.001
Oh, right!

00:02:47.034 --> 00:02:48.136
L-Leona!

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.806
You okay?

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.142
W-Why wouldn't I be?

00:02:51.176 --> 00:02:53.246
I told you I can
take care of myself.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.752
You stay focused
on King Vearn.

00:02:55.785 --> 00:02:57.922
But you're out of
breath... What happened?

00:02:57.955 --> 00:03:00.160
Did you hear a
word I just said?!

00:03:00.193 --> 00:03:02.364
Worrying about me
isn't staying focused!

00:03:02.397 --> 00:03:04.201
All right, yeesh.

00:03:04.235 --> 00:03:06.607
Leona [thought]: He can
do this... I know it.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.511
I was planning on
using my healing magic

00:03:08.544 --> 00:03:09.979
to keep him in the fight...

00:03:10.013 --> 00:03:13.520
Only, with this new power,
he may not need any help at all.

00:03:13.554 --> 00:03:15.791
I can't be sure about it,
but it looks like

00:03:15.825 --> 00:03:18.898
you might be right about where
these new skills came from...

00:03:18.931 --> 00:03:19.933
Vearn.

00:03:21.135 --> 00:03:23.574
Dai: Something unimaginable
has awakened inside of me...

00:03:23.607 --> 00:03:26.479
and I can feel it growing
stronger with every minute.

00:03:26.513 --> 00:03:29.318
It's like back when I first
ignited the power of my Crest...

00:03:29.352 --> 00:03:30.755
except more intense.

00:03:30.788 --> 00:03:33.426
I already figured out that
I can match you in battle...

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.331
but with this, I think
I might actually

00:03:35.364 --> 00:03:36.900
have a shot at beating you.

00:03:38.303 --> 00:03:43.814
[chuckling]

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:49.860
[cackling]

00:03:49.893 --> 00:03:54.335
Vearn: Oh child. You're
hardly a match for me yet.

00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:56.172
You still don't understand.

00:03:56.205 --> 00:03:58.677
With this strength,
you've become useful.

00:03:59.478 --> 00:04:01.650
You're either
selfless or naive.

00:04:01.684 --> 00:04:04.254
To inherit such an
incredible power...

00:04:04.288 --> 00:04:08.229
and not realize exactly what
it makes you capable of.

00:04:08.262 --> 00:04:11.002
It's almost sickening...
So let me be blunt.

00:04:11.035 --> 00:04:15.477
You now possess the power to
decide the fate of the world.

00:04:16.814 --> 00:04:18.618
Just like your
father before you...

00:04:18.651 --> 00:04:21.355
although it seems
he was more ambitious.

00:04:21.388 --> 00:04:25.264
I was always wary of what
his next move might be.

00:04:25.297 --> 00:04:26.667
As far as I'm concerned,

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.706
an opponent with tactics
as unpredictable as his...

00:04:29.739 --> 00:04:33.547
is someone I would rather
not have working against me.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.250
Vearn: And considering
the abilities

00:04:35.283 --> 00:04:36.920
you've demonstrated so far,

00:04:36.953 --> 00:04:40.595
I'd hate to see such
potential go to waste.

00:04:40.628 --> 00:04:43.901
W-What do you mean...
"go to waste"?

00:04:43.934 --> 00:04:45.203
What I mean is...

00:04:45.237 --> 00:04:47.007
that you have
become even mightier

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.546
than Baran's Dragonoid form.

00:04:49.579 --> 00:04:52.384
With the combined force
of your Twin Crests,

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:54.789
guided by the awakened
Combat Instincts

00:04:54.823 --> 00:04:57.795
of every Dragon Knight
who's come before you...

00:04:57.828 --> 00:04:59.999
There's no
question that you are

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:03.473
the most powerful being
I've ever encountered.

00:05:03.508 --> 00:05:06.647
As a matter of fact, one could
say you're the first challenger

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.984
who's ever come
close to my level.

00:05:09.018 --> 00:05:13.025
So just to be certain,
I'll ask you plainly...

00:05:16.533 --> 00:05:19.404
Will you join me
and serve my kingdom?

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:24.048
Dai: Why... Why
would I serve you?!

00:05:24.081 --> 00:05:25.652
It's not so outlandish.

00:05:25.685 --> 00:05:28.690
Don't forget, your
father's answer was, "Yes."

00:05:29.826 --> 00:05:32.464
Baran was a Dragon
Knight of pure lineage,

00:05:32.498 --> 00:05:33.734
and because of that,

00:05:33.768 --> 00:05:36.640
he understood just
how selfish and foolhardy

00:05:36.673 --> 00:05:39.479
the human world tends to be.

00:05:39.513 --> 00:05:42.385
Humans are despicable, Dai.

00:05:42.418 --> 00:05:44.890
They aren't worthy
of your fearsome power,

00:05:44.923 --> 00:05:48.230
and they don't
deserve your loyalty.

00:05:48.263 --> 00:05:50.300
You can fight for them.

00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:54.876
You may even be
victorious... But what then?

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:56.914
Dai: "What then"?

00:05:56.947 --> 00:05:58.249
I'd be willing to bet...

00:05:58.283 --> 00:06:01.890
that if you do manage to defeat
me and return to their world,

00:06:01.924 --> 00:06:05.564
sooner or later they'll
cast you aside in fear.

00:06:07.167 --> 00:06:10.674
I...I'm scared. He's so scary!

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.050
It is in their nature.

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:16.151
And you know it.

00:06:16.185 --> 00:06:18.691
They will come begging
when danger rears its head.

00:06:18.724 --> 00:06:21.061
But once peace is restored,

00:06:21.095 --> 00:06:25.538
they'll begin to see you as the
source of all their problems.

00:06:25.571 --> 00:06:27.875
And when they learn you
aren't one of them,

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:30.180
they'll strip you of
your Hero's title.

00:06:30.213 --> 00:06:33.654
They're too feeble-minded to
accept their own differences -

00:06:33.687 --> 00:06:36.158
let alone the rule
of a higher being.

00:06:36.191 --> 00:06:38.597
That is what humans truly are.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:39.899
No, you're wrong!

00:06:39.933 --> 00:06:42.605
Dai is our family. We would
never do that to him.

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:45.476
Perhaps not you, Princess.

00:06:45.511 --> 00:06:47.448
But we both know
that's only because

00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:50.922
you harbor a personal
affection for him.

00:06:50.955 --> 00:06:53.995
In the end, this case is
no different than Baran's.

00:06:54.028 --> 00:06:56.767
The feeling of one individual
cannot change something

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.406
as nebulous as the public
opinion of a nation.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.916
As royalty, you should
know that all too well.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.686
Vearn: Nevertheless,
I am different.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.423
I make no discriminations.

00:07:08.456 --> 00:07:11.930
I celebrate all who wield
terrifying strength...

00:07:11.963 --> 00:07:15.938
Even though Baran and Hadlar
eventually decided to betray me,

00:07:15.972 --> 00:07:19.545
I continue to hold them
both in the highest regard.

00:07:20.547 --> 00:07:22.519
You have a choice
to make, Dai:

00:07:22.552 --> 00:07:24.455
Will you risk
everything you've achieved

00:07:24.488 --> 00:07:26.158
for a worthless victory?

00:07:26.192 --> 00:07:30.099
Or will you serve the only one
who appreciates your true value?

00:07:30.133 --> 00:07:34.509
You may only be a child, but the
answer should still be obvious.

00:07:34.543 --> 00:07:36.646
So what do you say?

00:07:37.983 --> 00:07:39.820
Dai: My answer is...

00:07:39.853 --> 00:07:41.088
No, thanks.

00:07:42.223 --> 00:07:44.394
Then you are naive after all.

00:07:44.428 --> 00:07:46.499
I suppose you aren't
ready to let go of

00:07:46.533 --> 00:07:49.338
the sweet illusion
of being a hero.

00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:50.641
Dai: You're wrong!

00:07:51.276 --> 00:07:53.045
I know sometimes...

00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:54.582
Humans can be pretty cruel

00:07:54.616 --> 00:07:57.589
when it comes to things
they don't understand...

00:07:57.622 --> 00:08:00.493
I doubt you're wrong
about them accepting me.

00:08:02.532 --> 00:08:03.967
But it doesn't matter.

00:08:04.001 --> 00:08:06.674
Because I still love
every one of them.

00:08:06.707 --> 00:08:08.777
That'll get me through.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.650
I love the Surface World.

00:08:11.684 --> 00:08:14.922
All the creatures here
have made me who I am.

00:08:15.891 --> 00:08:16.927
Dai, you...

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.266
Even if everything you say
ends up coming true...

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.770
If the people
of the Surface World

00:08:21.803 --> 00:08:24.308
decide they don't
want me around...

00:08:24.342 --> 00:08:27.213
Dai: Then I guess...

00:08:27.247 --> 00:08:28.617
I guess...

00:08:30.186 --> 00:08:34.896
After I defeat you,
I'll leave it all behind.

00:08:38.036 --> 00:08:42.578
Vearn: I see.
Well, that's a pity.

00:08:42.612 --> 00:08:45.383
The humans will never
know how fortunate they were

00:08:45.417 --> 00:08:47.421
to have you as their lord.

00:08:47.454 --> 00:08:49.324
But to make the
almighty Dragon Knight

00:08:49.358 --> 00:08:52.297
spew such a
pathetic sentiment...

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.303
That is an unforgivable sin.

00:08:55.336 --> 00:08:57.742
You're about to
learn a costly lesson.

00:08:57.775 --> 00:08:58.911
Siding with them will be

00:08:58.944 --> 00:09:00.915
the greatest mistake
you've ever made, Dai.

00:09:00.948 --> 00:09:04.054
I hope the Mother Dragon has
a new Knight at the ready!

00:09:06.527 --> 00:09:08.062
Leona [thought]:
Come on, Dai...

00:09:08.095 --> 00:09:09.398
You can do it...

00:09:09.431 --> 00:09:11.335
Don't beat him
for anyone else...

00:09:11.368 --> 00:09:14.776
Beat him for yourself.
Prove him wrong.

00:09:23.326 --> 00:09:24.629
[roaring]

00:09:30.875 --> 00:09:33.078
I'm not sure exactly
how you're doing it,

00:09:33.112 --> 00:09:36.185
but it seems as though you
know what's going on outside...

00:09:36.218 --> 00:09:37.354
And whatever's happening

00:09:37.387 --> 00:09:39.992
clearly has you in a rush
to get this fight over with.

00:09:41.495 --> 00:09:44.201
Good thing we're almost
finished, Killvearn!

00:09:49.111 --> 00:09:49.946
Killvearn: Well, well...

00:09:49.979 --> 00:09:52.016
I didn't expect
you to last this long.

00:09:53.352 --> 00:09:54.455
Why not?

00:09:54.488 --> 00:09:56.660
The moment you decided
to hold this duel,

00:09:56.693 --> 00:09:59.766
you put yourself at
a serious disadvantage.

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:01.970
You only have
the one strategy:

00:10:02.003 --> 00:10:04.709
Snares and deception.
That's it.

00:10:04.742 --> 00:10:07.581
You wait for your targets
to wander into your traps...

00:10:07.615 --> 00:10:09.117
and once you've got
them immobilized,

00:10:09.151 --> 00:10:11.623
it's easy for you
to finish them off.

00:10:11.656 --> 00:10:12.959
For a Reaper,

00:10:12.992 --> 00:10:14.729
it's the most efficient
way of getting the job done...

00:10:14.762 --> 00:10:17.535
But it seems you've lost
the ability to properly fight-

00:10:17.569 --> 00:10:20.073
A fight where your
opponent can strike back.

00:10:20.106 --> 00:10:21.877
Your strength,
skill, and agility

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.014
are all top rate, however...

00:10:24.048 --> 00:10:26.352
your attacks lack the
determination needed...

00:10:26.385 --> 00:10:28.757
to win a duel like this.

00:10:28.791 --> 00:10:30.193
But I am shaped by combat.

00:10:30.227 --> 00:10:33.432
I've had more duels in
my life than hot meals.

00:10:33.465 --> 00:10:35.303
So in here, I hold
the advantage.

00:10:35.336 --> 00:10:37.909
You allowed your wounded ego
to get the better of you.

00:10:37.942 --> 00:10:40.614
If I had it my way,
I might show you mercy...

00:10:40.648 --> 00:10:42.985
Only, with a Judge
presiding over this duel,

00:10:43.018 --> 00:10:45.156
you've already
sealed your fate.

00:10:45.189 --> 00:10:49.164
That's right. You lose
no matter what, Killvearn.

00:10:52.939 --> 00:10:55.076
Killvearn: [chuckling]

00:10:55.109 --> 00:10:58.115
You are quite an
observant personality.

00:10:58.149 --> 00:11:00.587
It's true, winning
would be a challenge

00:11:00.621 --> 00:11:02.490
if I didn't have my traps.

00:11:02.524 --> 00:11:04.194
I suppose if I
really wanted to,

00:11:04.227 --> 00:11:07.802
I could train and become
unbeatable in a fair fight...

00:11:07.835 --> 00:11:10.741
As you say, I have
the strength and skill.

00:11:10.774 --> 00:11:12.444
[devious giggle]

00:11:12.477 --> 00:11:15.885
But I've lost interest in
such superficial victories.

00:11:15.918 --> 00:11:19.158
Besides, it's not
all about efficiency.

00:11:19.191 --> 00:11:20.894
Killvearn: There's
nothing more satisfying

00:11:20.928 --> 00:11:23.900
than watching a target fall
into one of my traps...

00:11:23.934 --> 00:11:27.742
Oh, how they squirm!
Like an insect in a spiderweb.

00:11:27.775 --> 00:11:28.744
It's glorious.

00:11:28.777 --> 00:11:30.013
The harder
someone has fought,

00:11:30.046 --> 00:11:32.183
the more delightful
their expression is

00:11:32.217 --> 00:11:35.323
when the snare tightens and
they realize it's all over.

00:11:35.356 --> 00:11:37.360
Once you've tasted
that kind of victory...

00:11:37.393 --> 00:11:39.833
Well, let's just say
the honorable flavors

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:41.402
begin to lose their appeal.

00:11:41.435 --> 00:11:43.172
[chuckling]

00:11:43.205 --> 00:11:44.942
Killvearn: A swift
and painful demise

00:11:44.976 --> 00:11:46.613
always hits the
spot, though...

00:11:46.646 --> 00:11:48.984
Especially on those
occasions when my prey

00:11:49.018 --> 00:11:50.386
believes they
have me beaten.

00:11:50.419 --> 00:11:53.593
Those are the times I
truly feel like a Reaper.

00:11:53.627 --> 00:11:55.964
[laughing]

00:11:56.833 --> 00:11:58.269
Avan: I've had enough.

00:11:58.303 --> 00:12:01.677
In all my battles, I've never
met an enemy as wicked as you.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.178
Prepare yourself!

00:12:08.691 --> 00:12:10.359
My sword - it
just shattered?!

00:12:10.393 --> 00:12:12.798
No, it definitely felt
like it hit something.

00:12:12.832 --> 00:12:14.234
Killvearn: Right you are.

00:12:14.268 --> 00:12:15.303
It didn't shatter...

00:12:15.336 --> 00:12:17.040
It was cut.

00:12:18.544 --> 00:12:19.946
Killvearn: As
you've pointed out,

00:12:19.979 --> 00:12:23.386
snares and deception are the
weapons I use to win my battles.

00:12:23.419 --> 00:12:26.560
So while we were fighting
I set up a snare in secret.

00:12:26.593 --> 00:12:28.229
I thought you were
an observant one,

00:12:28.262 --> 00:12:30.166
but it seems
not quite enough...

00:12:30.199 --> 00:12:31.837
Otherwise, you
would have noticed

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:33.940
how the lines on my
hat have been fading.

00:12:33.974 --> 00:12:37.013
Allow me to show
you why that is.

00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:38.917
Avan: Could it be...

00:12:43.293 --> 00:12:44.629
I-Invisible blades?!

00:12:44.662 --> 00:12:46.031
Killvearn: Bingo.

00:12:46.065 --> 00:12:49.037
The lines on my hat conceal
a set of razor-thin daggers

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:52.277
which are nearly impossible
to see once they've been drawn.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:54.849
I use them to finish off
my more stubborn enemies.

00:12:54.882 --> 00:12:56.786
They're hidden all
over this field,

00:12:56.819 --> 00:12:58.255
just waiting to be deployed...

00:12:58.288 --> 00:13:01.294
And only I know
how to find them.

00:13:02.197 --> 00:13:03.700
Killvearn: You're
standing in a cage

00:13:03.733 --> 00:13:06.004
made of thirteen
invisible blades.

00:13:06.038 --> 00:13:10.748
This is my finest work; the
nastiest trap of them all...

00:13:10.781 --> 00:13:13.854
The Phantom Razor!

00:13:13.887 --> 00:13:16.158
Prepare yourself, Avan.

00:13:16.191 --> 00:13:19.364
You were right - we
are nearly finished.

00:13:42.878 --> 00:13:48.824
[pained grunts]

00:13:48.857 --> 00:13:50.493
Killvearn: If you keep
being so careless,

00:13:50.528 --> 00:13:53.567
you're going to bleed
out before I'm finished.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.336
Why prolong the
inevitable, Avan?

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:59.579
It only takes one stab to that
brave little heart of yours...

00:13:59.612 --> 00:14:02.551
Killvearn: And all this
pain will be washed away.

00:14:04.622 --> 00:14:06.926
Killvearn: You say I'm
wicked, and yet here I am

00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:08.830
offering you an olive branch.

00:14:08.864 --> 00:14:11.570
You know what you'll say
when I finish you off?

00:14:11.603 --> 00:14:12.838
Killvearn: "Thank you.

00:14:12.871 --> 00:14:16.445
Thank you for freeing me
from this miserable hell."

00:14:20.521 --> 00:14:23.626
Avan [thought]: No... I'm...
I'm starting to fade...

00:14:24.963 --> 00:14:26.900
How terrifying a trap.

00:14:26.933 --> 00:14:28.202
I can't attack or defend

00:14:28.236 --> 00:14:30.574
if I don't know where
the blades are coming from.

00:14:30.607 --> 00:14:31.776
Very well, then.

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:34.247
If I'm not making it out
of this either way...

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.491
Killvearn: And now...

00:14:45.303 --> 00:14:48.375
[howling]

00:14:48.409 --> 00:14:50.781
Avan [thought]: I never
wanted to use this again...

00:14:50.815 --> 00:14:51.917
but he can't escape!

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:53.352
I have no choice!

00:14:53.385 --> 00:14:55.524
Killvearn:
Megante, I presume?

00:14:55.558 --> 00:14:57.961
We can't have that.

00:14:59.532 --> 00:15:00.634
Avan: The Judge?!

00:15:00.667 --> 00:15:03.238
Killvearn: If you use Megante,
neither of us will win.

00:15:03.272 --> 00:15:05.076
Then this Judge
was part of your...

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:06.212
Killvearn: But of course.

00:15:06.245 --> 00:15:08.115
Did you really think
I would only devise

00:15:08.148 --> 00:15:10.253
one trap for the likes of you?

00:15:10.286 --> 00:15:11.388
I've been preparing for this

00:15:11.421 --> 00:15:13.526
ever since you
shattered my mask.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.532
I even took the liberty of
altering this Judge's protocols

00:15:16.566 --> 00:15:19.437
to have it self-destruct along
with this field if needed.

00:15:19.471 --> 00:15:21.375
Avan [thought]: It can
use Megante, as well?

00:15:21.409 --> 00:15:22.177
Killvearn: You see?

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:23.547
When it comes to
settling a score,

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:26.118
snares and deception
are the best way to go...

00:15:26.151 --> 00:15:28.489
And on that note, farewell.

00:15:28.523 --> 00:15:30.059
No... W-Wait...

00:15:30.092 --> 00:15:30.861
Avan: Killvearn!

00:15:30.894 --> 00:15:32.029
Killvearn: Unhand me.

00:15:33.065 --> 00:15:35.670
[pained howl]

00:15:42.384 --> 00:15:45.189
Killvearn: Vengeance
is so delicious.

00:15:48.998 --> 00:15:51.637
Hang on. This isn't
the White Garden.

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:53.172
How did I end up here?

00:15:53.205 --> 00:15:56.312
This... This is
where Baran died.

00:15:56.345 --> 00:15:57.915
The shock from
the Judge's explosion

00:15:57.948 --> 00:16:00.053
must have knocked
me off-course.

00:16:00.086 --> 00:16:01.188
Or perhaps it was turbulence

00:16:01.221 --> 00:16:03.960
from the Dark King
doing battle with Dai...

00:16:03.994 --> 00:16:06.031
[roaring]

00:16:12.176 --> 00:16:15.050
Killvearn: Somehow,
Dai seems to be winning.

00:16:15.083 --> 00:16:16.586
Oh, well. Not to worry.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.526
I'm in no rush to come
to King Vearn's rescue.

00:16:19.559 --> 00:16:21.730
If the little brat
defeats him after all,

00:16:21.763 --> 00:16:23.934
then I suppose that's that.

00:16:23.967 --> 00:16:26.004
I may have
obligations to help him,

00:16:26.037 --> 00:16:29.177
but it's not as
if I'm duty-bound.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:33.452
That's what makes Mystvearn
and I so different.

00:16:33.485 --> 00:16:38.863
[menacing chuckle]

00:16:38.897 --> 00:16:42.571
Hyunckel: It looks like this is
the end for you... Mystvearn.

00:16:42.605 --> 00:16:45.744
At long last, the final
battle is underway...

00:16:45.777 --> 00:16:47.548
And you're about
to meet your doom.

00:16:47.581 --> 00:16:51.221
Mystvearn: Is that so? Who
among you could manage that?

00:16:51.254 --> 00:16:54.060
I see no one in your ranks
who will be a challenge.

00:16:54.094 --> 00:16:56.332
You showing up here
changes nothing.

00:16:56.365 --> 00:16:58.469
Do you think Crocodine
or that measly rat

00:16:58.503 --> 00:17:00.540
will stand a
chance against me?

00:17:00.573 --> 00:17:01.441
Why I oughta...

00:17:01.475 --> 00:17:03.680
Mystvearn: You've
seen for yourselves.

00:17:03.714 --> 00:17:08.455
Not even Lon Beruk or Larhart
could damage my ultimate form.

00:17:08.489 --> 00:17:12.664
There's no one in this world
who can bring about my doom.

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:15.537
Mystvearn: Perhaps there was a
glimmer of hope for you or Avan.

00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:19.377
But the former Hero is
busy fighting Killvearn...

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:20.479
Hyunckel [thought]:
Master is...

00:17:20.514 --> 00:17:22.183
Mystvearn: And you,
my former protege,

00:17:22.217 --> 00:17:24.856
you have already been
damaged beyond recovery.

00:17:24.889 --> 00:17:26.325
Your threats are empty.

00:17:26.358 --> 00:17:28.664
None of you can do
anything at all!

00:17:28.697 --> 00:17:31.903
[chuckling]

00:17:31.936 --> 00:17:34.374
We can't, but we
brought somebody who can.

00:17:34.407 --> 00:17:36.244
Mystvearn: What do you mean?

00:17:37.413 --> 00:17:37.982
Mystvearn: You... You can -
I don't believe it.

00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:39.551
He means me.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.666
Personally, I don't care
what happens to you.

00:17:46.699 --> 00:17:48.804
I haven't officially
joined these guys...

00:17:48.837 --> 00:17:51.576
Having said that, I did make
a warrior's pact with Hyunckel,

00:17:51.609 --> 00:17:53.914
and now I have to
treat all of his enemies

00:17:53.947 --> 00:17:56.051
as if they were my own.

00:17:56.084 --> 00:17:57.922
Don't take this
personally Mystvearn,

00:17:57.955 --> 00:17:59.926
but it's time for you to go.

00:17:59.959 --> 00:18:02.097
Popp: Are you serious?!

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:03.499
Larhart: This
specter isn't someone

00:18:03.533 --> 00:18:06.606
a puppet made out of metal
can do anything about.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.245
Just stand aside before
he turns you to scrap.

00:18:11.983 --> 00:18:14.722
[roaring]

00:18:14.755 --> 00:18:15.890
All: Aura?!

00:18:16.927 --> 00:18:17.828
Huh.

00:18:17.861 --> 00:18:19.599
Hym: You were saying, Larhart?

00:18:19.632 --> 00:18:21.268
Can a puppet do that?

00:18:21.301 --> 00:18:23.472
Things have changed since
the last time we met.

00:18:23.506 --> 00:18:25.343
I've been granted
an all-new power.

00:18:25.376 --> 00:18:27.548
Why don't I show you
a few of the things

00:18:27.581 --> 00:18:29.484
I've been learning
to do with it.

00:18:33.492 --> 00:18:35.463
Mystvearn [thought]: A
metallic life form using Aura?

00:18:35.496 --> 00:18:38.803
Impossible!
It's inconceivable!

00:18:38.836 --> 00:18:39.972
Here it comes!

00:18:40.005 --> 00:18:41.308
Chiu: Hold it!

00:18:41.341 --> 00:18:44.214
Everyone knows you can't
engage an enemy in combat

00:18:44.247 --> 00:18:46.686
without your
Captain's approval!

00:18:50.025 --> 00:18:51.796
Hym: All right, then,
Mister Captain.

00:18:51.829 --> 00:18:53.065
I request your approval.

00:18:53.099 --> 00:18:56.539
Can I knock the lights out of
this walking lampshade, or what?

00:18:56.572 --> 00:18:57.942
Sure. Get him.

00:18:57.975 --> 00:19:00.412
Now... Where were we?

00:19:00.914 --> 00:19:01.649
It worked...

00:19:01.682 --> 00:19:02.651
He's so fast.

00:19:02.685 --> 00:19:05.857
[roaring]

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:07.628
Larhart [thought]: That is
some impressive speed.

00:19:07.661 --> 00:19:09.799
Along with the
durability of Orichalcum

00:19:09.832 --> 00:19:11.936
and the power of Aura...

00:19:11.969 --> 00:19:13.506
I have to admit,

00:19:13.539 --> 00:19:16.679
I may have been severely
underestimating this one.

00:19:16.713 --> 00:19:18.181
[roaring]

00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:20.253
Wait, Hyunckel...

00:19:20.286 --> 00:19:21.889
That Aura, it's...

00:19:21.922 --> 00:19:22.892
You're right.

00:19:22.925 --> 00:19:24.261
Hym's new aura...

00:19:24.294 --> 00:19:26.966
It's neither Dark
nor Dark Fire Energy.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.636
It's something pure.

00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:30.907
I knew it. It's
an Aura of Light!

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.711
But Hym was part
of the Dark Army?!

00:19:32.745 --> 00:19:34.515
Even while we were
dueling each other,

00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:37.588
Hym was already beginning
to emit this Aura of Light.

00:19:37.621 --> 00:19:39.692
Extending himself
beyond good and evil,

00:19:39.726 --> 00:19:42.296
seeking only to settle
his vendetta with me,

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:44.234
it pushed him
out of the darkness.

00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:45.203
It makes sense.

00:19:45.236 --> 00:19:47.006
His timing
couldn't be better.

00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:48.677
Aura of Light is
the greatest weakness

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:51.315
of a being of
Darkness like Mystvearn.

00:19:51.348 --> 00:19:52.250
Hyunckel: Exactly.

00:19:52.283 --> 00:19:53.586
No one stands a better chance

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.857
of defeating our
adversary than him.

00:19:59.598 --> 00:20:00.701
What a hit.

00:20:00.734 --> 00:20:02.671
Chiu [thought]:
This one's a huge find!

00:20:02.704 --> 00:20:03.773
Good going!

00:20:03.807 --> 00:20:06.713
Keep up that intensity.
You've got this, Little Hym!

00:20:06.746 --> 00:20:09.618
Come on. "Little Hym"?
You're kidding me, right?

00:20:09.651 --> 00:20:10.419
What can I say?

00:20:10.453 --> 00:20:12.123
All my Commandos
get a nickname.

00:20:12.156 --> 00:20:13.426
It's a dominance thing.

00:20:13.459 --> 00:20:14.695
Hym: Why am I not surprised?

00:20:14.729 --> 00:20:17.166
Can't you come up with
a better one that that?

00:20:17.199 --> 00:20:19.939
Let's see. Little Hym...
Hymmy... Hymster...

00:20:19.972 --> 00:20:20.941
Any preference?

00:20:20.974 --> 00:20:22.077
Not really.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:23.947
I guess I'll stick with
"Little Hym" then.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.449
That was my first
choice, too.

00:20:25.483 --> 00:20:27.052
With the way Chiu's
treating this guy,

00:20:27.086 --> 00:20:30.426
you'd never know that he's maybe
the strongest person here.

00:20:30.459 --> 00:20:32.531
Larhart [thought]:
This rat sure is a mystery.

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:35.469
[roaring]

00:20:38.409 --> 00:20:40.013
Is this all you've got?

00:20:40.046 --> 00:20:41.181
Mystvearn [thought]: Curses!

00:20:41.214 --> 00:20:43.520
This chattering pawn
is testing my patience.

00:20:43.553 --> 00:20:45.891
Chiu: That's right!
Now finish him, Little Hym!

00:20:45.924 --> 00:20:47.127
Or, hey! How about "Pawny"?

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.663
You know,
since you're a pawn?

00:20:48.696 --> 00:20:49.464
It doesn't matter!

00:20:49.497 --> 00:20:50.968
You can call me
whatever you want!

00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:52.436
I'm a little busy here.

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.542
Hym, watch yourself!

00:20:54.575 --> 00:20:56.445
Mystvearn: I'll tear
all of you to shreds.

00:20:56.478 --> 00:20:59.685
Dark Puppetry
Aura Decimation Field!

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.928
[pained yells]

00:21:07.868 --> 00:21:10.773
Your little tricks
won't work on me.

00:21:13.212 --> 00:21:17.152
No way. All Hym had to
do was stomp one foot...

00:21:17.186 --> 00:21:19.023
And Mystvearn's
Field was shattered!

00:21:20.493 --> 00:21:21.763
Enough of these games.

00:21:21.796 --> 00:21:24.702
Come at me like a
man... you coward.

00:21:24.735 --> 00:21:25.771
Unbelievable.

00:21:25.804 --> 00:21:27.574
Hym is actually amazing!

00:21:27.607 --> 00:21:30.379
To be honest, I'm a
little shocked myself.

00:21:30.413 --> 00:21:32.216
I never imagined
Hadlar's crony

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:42.637
could possess such
extraordinary power.

00:21:42.671 --> 00:21:43.906
[roaring]

00:21:53.325 --> 00:21:54.728
Dai [thought]:
I can do this...

00:21:54.761 --> 00:21:58.068
I can defeat him.
I know I can!

00:23:37.367 --> 00:23:38.837
Narrator: Surrounded
in Aura of Light,

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:40.740
Hym has freed the
Disciples of Avan

00:23:40.773 --> 00:23:42.845
from the clutches of
the Decimation Field,

00:23:42.878 --> 00:23:45.784
and now he closes in on
defeating Mystvearn.

00:23:45.817 --> 00:23:48.990
Meanwhile, Dai holds his
advantage against the Dark King,

00:23:49.023 --> 00:23:51.395
but in the face of Vearn's
unwavering confidence,

00:23:51.428 --> 00:23:53.498
doubt seizes him once again.

00:23:53.533 --> 00:23:56.171
As an uneasy air swirls
across the battlefield,

00:23:56.204 --> 00:23:58.876
will Dai and his friends hold
fast and claim the victory?

00:23:58.909 --> 00:24:00.580
Find out on
the next episode of

00:24:00.613 --> 00:24:02.518
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:02.551 --> 00:24:04.453
"The Deciding Attack".
