WEBVTT

00:01:53.994 --> 00:01:55.731
Popp [thought]:
Help me out here, Gods.

00:02:02.512 --> 00:02:03.514
Uh, Popp?

00:02:03.548 --> 00:02:04.849
Come on...

00:02:07.454 --> 00:02:09.491
What's happening? Let's go.

00:02:10.562 --> 00:02:16.606
I knew it... I knew...
this wouldn't work...

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:24.856
Popp: I can't...
I can't do it.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.908
[devious cackle]

00:02:33.941 --> 00:02:36.379
[meancing growls]

00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:44.295
Merle: Monsters...
There's so many of them.

00:02:44.328 --> 00:02:45.230
Hyunckel: Get up.

00:02:45.263 --> 00:02:46.466
Maam: Hurry!

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.537
Dai: I know you
can do this, Popp.

00:02:48.571 --> 00:02:49.739
Just try!

00:02:49.773 --> 00:02:50.474
It's okay.

00:02:50.508 --> 00:02:52.111
I know you're nervous but...

00:02:52.144 --> 00:02:53.413
Maybe if you...

00:02:53.447 --> 00:02:55.785
If you clear your mind
and give it another shot...

00:02:56.452 --> 00:02:58.991
Popp: There's no point.

00:02:59.024 --> 00:03:02.064
Popp: Trust me,
Princess. It won't work.

00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:03.300
No matter what I do,

00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:06.472
nothing is going to
make my Insignia light up.

00:03:07.576 --> 00:03:11.884
Popp: I've already tried
everything I can think of...

00:03:11.918 --> 00:03:13.987
and it never glows.

00:03:15.324 --> 00:03:16.960
Popp: I really am useless.

00:03:16.993 --> 00:03:20.300
Maybe there isn't a power
in my soul to unleash.

00:03:20.334 --> 00:03:22.972
I mean, the rest of you
all got yours to work

00:03:23.006 --> 00:03:24.509
right here on the spot...

00:03:24.542 --> 00:03:26.814
But I can't even get
this thing to flicker

00:03:26.847 --> 00:03:28.383
when I give it my all.

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:30.421
I studied the Ancient Tome,

00:03:30.454 --> 00:03:32.357
I trained as
hard as I could...

00:03:32.391 --> 00:03:34.194
it didn't change a thing.

00:03:34.228 --> 00:03:36.867
I was hoping when it all
came down to the wire,

00:03:36.901 --> 00:03:38.070
I'd have what it takes...

00:03:38.103 --> 00:03:38.804
[sniffling]

00:03:40.508 --> 00:03:44.716
But it turns out I don't.
I'm so stupid.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.752
I'm sorry, you guys.

00:03:45.785 --> 00:03:47.722
I really didn't want
to let anybody down...

00:03:47.756 --> 00:03:50.294
But I just don't have
the strength for this.

00:03:50.327 --> 00:03:53.266
It's all...
It's all my fault.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.737
[sobbing]

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:55.838
Popp...

00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:57.975
Master Avan...

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:00.514
W-Why would you
give this to me?

00:04:00.548 --> 00:04:02.952
You must've known I
wasn't worthy.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.026
Flora: This isn't good.

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:07.361
Without all five Disciples,

00:04:07.394 --> 00:04:09.332
even if Leona casts
the Kaglimmer spell,

00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:11.536
it's not going to
have enough power.

00:04:12.437 --> 00:04:14.610
Merle [thought]:
Don't give up, Popp...

00:04:14.643 --> 00:04:17.314
Soldier: [terrified scream]

00:04:43.767 --> 00:04:44.970
These creatures...

00:04:45.003 --> 00:04:45.871
Mystvearn: [chuckling]

00:04:55.324 --> 00:04:58.430
Zaboera: [cackling]

00:04:58.463 --> 00:05:00.635
They've got us
completely surrounded here.

00:05:00.668 --> 00:05:03.039
I've never seen monsters
like these before.

00:05:03.072 --> 00:05:04.375
Merle: It doesn't make sense.

00:05:04.408 --> 00:05:06.179
Why couldn't I
sense all of them coming?

00:05:06.212 --> 00:05:09.887
Those Magic Capsules must have
concealed their life-force.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.092
The enemy was luring
us into a trap all along.

00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:14.028
Zaboera: Behold!

00:05:14.062 --> 00:05:15.230
You will be no match

00:05:15.264 --> 00:05:18.436
for the elite warriors
of the New Dark Army.

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:20.841
These these creatures
come from the Underworld-

00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:24.314
the homeland of
King Vearn himself.

00:05:24.348 --> 00:05:25.183
Oh, rats.

00:05:25.216 --> 00:05:26.520
The Underworld?

00:05:26.553 --> 00:05:29.124
And Monsters from the Underworld
are far more powerful

00:05:29.157 --> 00:05:32.397
than the ones who inhabit
your pathetic Surface World.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.103
I have no doubt they'll
dispose of you fools

00:05:35.136 --> 00:05:37.240
like the worthless
trash you are.

00:05:37.274 --> 00:05:39.445
[laughing]

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.482
Yeah? You wanna bet?

00:05:41.516 --> 00:05:44.789
Oh, please - I don't
need to wager anything.

00:05:50.033 --> 00:05:52.037
Destroy them all!

00:05:56.078 --> 00:05:59.586
Oh, no. Even with Crocodine,
there's way too many of them...

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:01.122
We'd better go lend a hand.

00:06:01.155 --> 00:06:01.991
Right.

00:06:02.024 --> 00:06:03.293
Flora: Hold your positions.

00:06:03.326 --> 00:06:05.197
It's all for nothing
if you don't finish

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:06.934
casting the
Kaglimmer spell...

00:06:06.967 --> 00:06:08.771
If you break the
circle of enchantment,

00:06:08.804 --> 00:06:12.545
whatever power you have
already conjured will vanish.

00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:14.816
You still need Popp's light
to complete the spell...

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:17.321
Leave the fighting to us.
We'll buy you the time.

00:06:17.354 --> 00:06:20.026
Hang on. Queen Flora.
I-I don't think...

00:06:22.064 --> 00:06:23.901
You'll do it. I know Avan.

00:06:23.934 --> 00:06:26.472
He would never choose
the wrong person.

00:06:27.273 --> 00:06:28.476
Have some faith.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.881
Don't worry - we'll
handle the Dark Army.

00:06:33.185 --> 00:06:34.555
[hopeless sigh]

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:37.529
Popp [thought]: There's no way
they can fend off so many.

00:06:37.562 --> 00:06:40.000
I hate to say it,
but if we don't help,

00:06:40.033 --> 00:06:42.237
then they're done for.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:43.941
Nova: Well, how
many do you think

00:06:43.975 --> 00:06:45.778
you can handle, Crocodine?

00:06:47.147 --> 00:06:48.283
Nova: They might be stronger

00:06:48.316 --> 00:06:50.254
than any creature
I've ever faced...

00:06:50.287 --> 00:06:52.357
but I think I could
take forty or fifty.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.861
We can't let even
one reach Dai

00:06:53.894 --> 00:06:55.765
and the others while
they're casting that spell.

00:06:55.798 --> 00:06:58.269
That means you and
I are going to have to

00:06:58.302 --> 00:06:59.639
give this
everything we've got.

00:06:59.672 --> 00:07:02.243
Couldn't have put it better
myself, Hero of the North.

00:07:02.277 --> 00:07:04.282
I did command
the Furfang Legion,

00:07:04.315 --> 00:07:07.087
so I reckon I could
handle a hundred...

00:07:07.121 --> 00:07:09.491
What d'you say
we go find out?

00:07:10.628 --> 00:07:12.531
Chiu: Steady now, troops!

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:13.934
Chiu: It's no
time for fear...

00:07:13.968 --> 00:07:16.506
So what if they're
from the Underworld?

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.675
Let's show these monsters

00:07:17.708 --> 00:07:20.013
what the Beast King
Commandos are made of.

00:07:20.047 --> 00:07:23.085
[cheering]

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:24.623
All right. Ursa,
Drohly, Nibbles!

00:07:24.656 --> 00:07:26.292
You'll be our ground support.

00:07:26.325 --> 00:07:27.728
Terry, Drack-Drack,
and Rumbles-

00:07:27.762 --> 00:07:29.533
I want you attacking
from above...

00:07:29.566 --> 00:07:31.770
Daigo, Spikey, and
Seari, you run around

00:07:31.804 --> 00:07:34.475
and try to cause as much
confusion as you can...

00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:36.412
And Gomechan,
you're our messenger.

00:07:36.446 --> 00:07:39.151
So go tell Dai and the
others to hurry this up.

00:07:39.184 --> 00:07:40.219
[chirp]

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.359
[chuckling]

00:07:43.392 --> 00:07:44.562
Not to worry.

00:07:44.596 --> 00:07:47.535
Mr. Beast is doing
exactly what he does best!

00:07:47.568 --> 00:07:49.037
[charging roars]

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.647
Now that's what I call bravery.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.686
Let's try to follow
his example, everyone.

00:08:01.229 --> 00:08:03.600
Brokeena: Whoa! Alley-oop!

00:08:05.604 --> 00:08:06.472
That's right.

00:08:06.506 --> 00:08:07.775
We're not trying to win this.

00:08:07.808 --> 00:08:09.846
Just make a wall
and stand strong.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.749
The only thing
we have to do is

00:08:11.783 --> 00:08:13.219
hold all these
creatures off until

00:08:13.253 --> 00:08:16.527
the Disciples of Avan
finish casting their spell.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.562
You got it?

00:08:17.595 --> 00:08:19.031
[battle cries]

00:08:19.064 --> 00:08:24.107
[charging roars]

00:08:30.186 --> 00:08:31.389
Mystvearn: Not so fast.

00:08:31.422 --> 00:08:33.025
Mystvearn: I'm not
finished with you.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:35.096
It's exactly as
you said, Lon Beruk.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:38.804
So long as I'm still standing,
you're stuck sparring with me-

00:08:38.837 --> 00:08:40.407
whether you like it or not...

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.616
And I won't allow
you to interfere.

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:45.752
Lon Beruk [thought]: Come on.

00:08:45.785 --> 00:08:47.388
What's taking them so long?

00:08:47.421 --> 00:08:49.124
[chirp]

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:57.107
[worried chirps]

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.177
Yeah. We're doing our best.

00:08:59.211 --> 00:09:00.012
Come on...

00:09:00.046 --> 00:09:01.883
the others won't
be able to hold off

00:09:01.917 --> 00:09:04.021
these monsters
for much longer.

00:09:04.054 --> 00:09:07.327
Just hurry... We need
you to try again.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.197
Popp, please!

00:09:09.231 --> 00:09:12.471
Princess, I think we should
make a tactical retreat!

00:09:12.505 --> 00:09:13.940
[gasps]

00:09:16.613 --> 00:09:19.151
Listen, I'm useless right now.

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:21.757
No matter how many
times I try to do this,

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.727
it's not going to work.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.731
We've rescued
Hyunckel and Crocodine.

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:27.334
If we cut our losses now,

00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:29.773
why can't we try the
spell again once I'm ready?

00:09:29.806 --> 00:09:33.847
I already told you, remember?
No second chances.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.885
We've come way
too far to back down.

00:09:35.918 --> 00:09:37.989
If we do, our enemies
will never let us

00:09:38.023 --> 00:09:40.327
get this close to
Vearn Palace again.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.629
This is the only opportunity

00:09:41.663 --> 00:09:43.867
we have to cast
the Kaglimmer spell.

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.038
Popp: But I can't...

00:09:46.071 --> 00:09:47.942
I know you feel
like there's no hope,

00:09:47.975 --> 00:09:51.182
but if you run now, your
Insignia will never glow.

00:09:51.215 --> 00:09:54.321
The Mysticite's light comes
from the power of your soul...

00:09:54.355 --> 00:09:57.461
It's not about some special
technique or training.

00:09:57.494 --> 00:10:00.299
That means the problem
is inside of you.

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:01.736
And if you keep
avoiding that,

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.543
eventually it's going to
break your spirit entirely.

00:10:04.576 --> 00:10:06.580
Once that happens,
there won't be anything

00:10:06.613 --> 00:10:08.282
you can do to change it.

00:10:10.955 --> 00:10:13.827
Merle [thought]: Why?
Why can't Popp do it?

00:10:13.861 --> 00:10:15.531
I know he has it in him...

00:10:15.565 --> 00:10:18.102
He has such a kind
and honorable soul-

00:10:18.136 --> 00:10:20.273
so what could be
getting in his way?

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.747
Popp: All right, then...

00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:26.787
I guess I'm never
going to do it,

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.526
so give this stupid
thing to someone who can!

00:10:29.559 --> 00:10:30.360
Wait - what?

00:10:30.393 --> 00:10:31.630
It belongs to you.

00:10:31.663 --> 00:10:36.138
Well... Maybe it doesn't.
I'm not like any of you.

00:10:36.171 --> 00:10:39.245
I'm not royalty, and I wasn't
born a warrior either.

00:10:39.278 --> 00:10:40.814
So just forget it!

00:10:43.152 --> 00:10:44.655
Why can't he see?

00:11:04.596 --> 00:11:05.597
Popp: Think about it...

00:11:05.631 --> 00:11:08.470
Courage, Fortitude,
Justice, Love...

00:11:08.504 --> 00:11:10.073
What else is there, huh?

00:11:10.106 --> 00:11:12.811
If my soul's supposed to
have some "unique power",

00:11:12.845 --> 00:11:15.618
I have no idea what
it is - do you?

00:11:15.651 --> 00:11:17.955
Because if one of
you knows, I'm all ears.

00:11:17.989 --> 00:11:20.359
If I'm missing something,
just spit it out!

00:11:20.393 --> 00:11:21.930
I'll do whatever it takes!

00:11:21.963 --> 00:11:24.001
Nothing? Are you all stumped?

00:11:24.034 --> 00:11:27.040
Well, here's your answer.
I don't belong!

00:11:27.073 --> 00:11:28.209
That isn't true.

00:11:28.242 --> 00:11:31.850
Then throw me a line.
I'm begging you.

00:11:31.883 --> 00:11:35.891
I don't want you all
to fail because of me...

00:11:35.924 --> 00:11:38.764
With or without you, if we
do nothing, we're doomed.

00:11:38.797 --> 00:11:40.233
Unless Vearn is stopped,

00:11:40.266 --> 00:11:43.439
he'll destroy the
entire Surface World.

00:11:43.472 --> 00:11:44.809
Hyunckel: We all
have our virtues.

00:11:44.842 --> 00:11:47.214
If anyone doesn't
belong, it's me.

00:11:47.247 --> 00:11:50.788
I spent years in evil,
yet now my Insignia glows.

00:11:50.821 --> 00:11:52.958
You've spent all this
time fighting for justice

00:11:52.992 --> 00:11:54.763
and that has to
count for something.

00:11:54.796 --> 00:11:55.597
Yeah, he's right.

00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:56.866
And if it weren't for you,

00:11:56.899 --> 00:11:58.402
I wouldn't have
found the courage

00:11:58.436 --> 00:11:59.471
to face King Vearn again.

00:11:59.505 --> 00:12:01.743
Just listen. You always
stand up for what's right.

00:12:01.777 --> 00:12:04.281
I know you can do this.
Believe me.

00:12:05.383 --> 00:12:06.753
Maybe you don't see it,

00:12:06.786 --> 00:12:09.892
but I know exactly how
strong your soul is.

00:12:09.926 --> 00:12:12.064
You've never backed down.

00:12:12.097 --> 00:12:14.869
I admire you
more than anyone.

00:12:17.173 --> 00:12:20.848
Popp: I... I...

00:12:20.881 --> 00:12:22.985
I don't care
if you admire me!

00:12:23.019 --> 00:12:25.490
That doesn't change
a thing - get it?!

00:12:25.524 --> 00:12:26.491
[surprised gasp]

00:12:29.331 --> 00:12:30.601
Zaboera: [cackling]

00:12:30.634 --> 00:12:33.707
Yes, good! Crush them!

00:12:33.741 --> 00:12:35.209
Zaboera [thought]:
Pillars of light...

00:12:35.242 --> 00:12:36.646
How intriguing.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.349
The disciples must
be trying to conjure

00:12:38.382 --> 00:12:41.388
some sort of spell
to breach the palace.

00:12:42.892 --> 00:12:45.096
But that annoying
little brat of a Mage

00:12:45.129 --> 00:12:48.469
appears to be having
some trouble. Hmm...

00:12:48.503 --> 00:12:50.173
There's an idea.

00:12:50.206 --> 00:12:53.045
If I'm able to put a stop
to their incantation and

00:12:53.079 --> 00:12:55.216
destroy the human forces,

00:12:55.249 --> 00:12:58.490
there's no chance of them
mounting another resistance.

00:12:58.524 --> 00:12:59.859
And if I can do that,

00:12:59.893 --> 00:13:02.264
it won't matter how much
Mystvearn despises me

00:13:02.297 --> 00:13:04.467
and belittles my role
in the Dark Army.

00:13:04.502 --> 00:13:09.244
King Vearn will finally see that
I am the more valuable servant.

00:13:10.982 --> 00:13:12.117
Zaboera: Very well.

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:13.920
This should do away
with the boy quickly.

00:13:13.953 --> 00:13:15.624
And once he's out
of the picture,

00:13:15.657 --> 00:13:18.964
my future will
become even brighter.

00:13:18.997 --> 00:13:22.003
C'mon! Let's give these
brutes a taste of justice!

00:13:22.036 --> 00:13:29.250
[battling grunts]

00:13:30.554 --> 00:13:32.692
Flora [thought]: You must
cast aside your doubts, Popp.

00:13:32.725 --> 00:13:36.231
You know in your heart that
you're a true Disciple of Avan.

00:13:37.869 --> 00:13:39.873
What is it with you?

00:13:39.906 --> 00:13:42.912
Why do you always
say these awful things?

00:13:42.945 --> 00:13:48.122
I was just... I was only
trying to tell you how I feel.

00:13:48.155 --> 00:13:49.926
Merle [thought]:
You really don't see it?

00:13:49.959 --> 00:13:52.230
It's because he's
in love with you, Maam.

00:13:52.263 --> 00:13:55.805
And to find out that all you
feel for him is admiration...

00:13:55.838 --> 00:13:58.075
He must be devastated...

00:13:59.645 --> 00:14:00.848
I would know...

00:14:00.881 --> 00:14:03.386
Is there... Is there
anything I can do for him?

00:14:03.419 --> 00:14:06.826
How can I show him that
someone understands?

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.297
He may never
understand how I feel,

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.370
but that doesn't mean
I don't want to help him.

00:14:12.403 --> 00:14:13.472
[worried gasp]

00:14:13.507 --> 00:14:15.911
Merle [thought]: And I sense
something else, as well.

00:14:15.945 --> 00:14:18.516
But where? Where is
it coming from?!

00:14:21.355 --> 00:14:22.858
Merle [thought]:
It's a different evil

00:14:22.891 --> 00:14:24.327
than the creatures
we're fighting.

00:14:27.066 --> 00:14:29.104
[devious chuckle]

00:14:29.137 --> 00:14:32.243
This Venom Chain has been
steeped in my Dark Power,

00:14:32.276 --> 00:14:35.718
making a fearsome projectile
that can pierce any enemy.

00:14:35.751 --> 00:14:37.086
As the name suggests,

00:14:37.119 --> 00:14:39.057
it's potent enough that a
single scratch will deliver

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:42.497
enough toxins to
cause a painful demise.

00:14:42.532 --> 00:14:43.867
And while it may not work

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.371
on those four
protected by Holy Light,

00:14:46.405 --> 00:14:50.479
it will most certainly
do the trick with the mage.

00:14:51.248 --> 00:14:52.919
Merle: Up there.
What is that?

00:14:52.952 --> 00:14:54.354
Leona: Come on, Popp.

00:14:54.387 --> 00:14:57.595
This isn't the time to argue.
Please, try it again.

00:14:57.628 --> 00:14:58.563
Leona's right.

00:14:58.596 --> 00:15:00.534
I've seen you do way
harder things before.

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:01.836
You can do this.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:02.739
And hurry.

00:15:02.772 --> 00:15:03.907
Come on.

00:15:11.121 --> 00:15:12.357
[dejected chuckle]

00:15:12.391 --> 00:15:15.029
You all think too much
of me, you know that?

00:15:15.062 --> 00:15:16.331
Popp: Well,
here's what I think.

00:15:16.364 --> 00:15:19.204
If I run off now, the rest
of you will figure out

00:15:19.237 --> 00:15:21.509
some other way
to save the world.

00:15:22.711 --> 00:15:24.849
Maam: Popp, no.

00:15:24.883 --> 00:15:28.422
Popp: I am sorry, but
I don't have it in me.

00:15:28.455 --> 00:15:29.525
I just don't...

00:15:29.558 --> 00:15:32.196
And I'm not going to stand
here and watch while you

00:15:32.229 --> 00:15:35.904
all get hurt just because
you can't accept the truth.

00:15:35.937 --> 00:15:39.477
If that disappoints
you... well so be it.

00:15:39.512 --> 00:15:41.248
Farewell!

00:15:43.854 --> 00:15:45.657
Somebody, stop that attack!

00:15:46.626 --> 00:15:48.095
Take it down!

00:15:53.305 --> 00:15:54.440
Gotcha!

00:16:18.857 --> 00:16:20.159
No...

00:16:22.631 --> 00:16:23.934
Merle...

00:16:23.967 --> 00:16:24.768
Oh, no.

00:16:25.804 --> 00:16:27.808
Curses! You foolish
little girl.

00:16:27.841 --> 00:16:30.380
You've gone and
ruined everything!

00:16:30.413 --> 00:16:32.216
You bastard!

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:33.587
Anybody... A Heal spell...

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.691
Popp: She needs a
Heal spell right now!

00:16:35.724 --> 00:16:37.126
Please, anyone!

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.663
I'll be right there.

00:16:38.696 --> 00:16:39.866
Merle: No, wait.

00:16:39.899 --> 00:16:41.068
But, you...

00:16:41.101 --> 00:16:44.474
Forget about me.
She can't break the circle.

00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:45.778
M-Merle...

00:16:45.811 --> 00:16:49.351
It's all right.
I'm already beyond help.

00:16:49.384 --> 00:16:52.390
Besides, no second chances.

00:16:52.423 --> 00:16:55.095
You mustn't let the
Kaglimmer go to waste.

00:16:55.129 --> 00:16:57.100
I know Popp will
be your fifth star.

00:16:57.133 --> 00:16:59.873
I've sensed
what's in his soul.

00:16:59.906 --> 00:17:01.909
But, Merle... why did you...

00:17:01.943 --> 00:17:03.145
Y-You're going to...

00:17:03.179 --> 00:17:05.517
Why would you do
something like this?

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:07.120
Because I saw you.

00:17:07.154 --> 00:17:09.057
You were in so much pain.

00:17:09.091 --> 00:17:11.630
And I - I guess I
just wanted to help.

00:17:11.663 --> 00:17:14.300
Then this weapon... it was
heading straight for you.

00:17:14.334 --> 00:17:16.005
It all happened so fast...

00:17:16.038 --> 00:17:18.576
I was the only one
close enough to stop it.

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:21.047
Popp: You didn't have to
throw yourself in the way...

00:17:21.081 --> 00:17:23.352
Not for a coward like me.

00:17:23.385 --> 00:17:26.424
It shouldn't be you...
I'm the one who deserves this.

00:17:26.458 --> 00:17:29.665
Why? Why throw your life away
for someone born to lose?!

00:17:34.642 --> 00:17:36.378
You idiot!

00:17:36.411 --> 00:17:39.183
Seriously, Popp.
You are so dense.

00:17:39.217 --> 00:17:42.390
Merle's the one who believes
in you more than anyone.

00:17:42.423 --> 00:17:46.231
And you know why?
It's because she loves you!

00:17:48.603 --> 00:17:51.141
Princess...
How - how could you?

00:17:51.174 --> 00:17:55.416
I was... I was going to
tell him that myself one day.

00:17:56.418 --> 00:17:57.988
I'm sorry.

00:17:58.022 --> 00:18:00.994
No, that's...
That's not true.

00:18:01.027 --> 00:18:03.533
I doubt I'd ever
be able to say it.

00:18:03.566 --> 00:18:06.806
I don't... I never
had the courage.

00:18:09.344 --> 00:18:10.914
Merle: But it's true, Popp.

00:18:10.947 --> 00:18:15.389
I've always loved you, ever
since the moment we first met.

00:18:15.422 --> 00:18:17.761
You always act
like this bumbling fool,

00:18:17.794 --> 00:18:21.435
but inside you're strong
and full of courage.

00:18:21.468 --> 00:18:22.905
There's just
something about you.

00:18:22.939 --> 00:18:26.478
No matter what you're facing,
whether you're sad or afraid...

00:18:26.512 --> 00:18:29.819
In the end, you always
find a way to overcome it.

00:18:29.852 --> 00:18:32.057
For someone as shy as I am,

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:36.331
you've always been
such an inspiration...

00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:40.139
But I... I was too
afraid to tell you.

00:18:40.173 --> 00:18:43.112
I followed the party so
I could be closer to you...

00:18:43.146 --> 00:18:44.516
but as time went on,

00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:48.155
I realized I could
never say how I felt.

00:18:48.188 --> 00:18:51.061
I was... I was so afraid
that it would ruin

00:18:51.095 --> 00:18:52.531
the friendship we have...

00:18:52.564 --> 00:18:55.235
that you wouldn't
feel the same way.

00:18:55.269 --> 00:18:59.143
I always hated how
cowardly it made me feel.

00:19:01.983 --> 00:19:03.719
Merle: But not anymore.

00:19:03.753 --> 00:19:08.796
I had the courage to save you
- to do something useful.

00:19:11.435 --> 00:19:12.538
Merle!

00:19:12.571 --> 00:19:14.040
This doesn't look good, Popp.

00:19:14.073 --> 00:19:15.409
I think that
she's been poisoned,

00:19:15.443 --> 00:19:17.146
and that wound
is far too deep.

00:19:17.179 --> 00:19:19.250
Even a Fullheal
spell couldn't...

00:19:19.283 --> 00:19:21.922
Popp: I don't care, we
need to try it. Please...

00:19:21.956 --> 00:19:22.924
Listen...

00:19:24.193 --> 00:19:27.535
Would you grant me one
final request, Popp?

00:19:27.568 --> 00:19:29.270
It's a little selfish of me,

00:19:29.303 --> 00:19:32.010
and I already
know the answer...

00:19:32.043 --> 00:19:36.484
But would you... Would you tell
me who you're in love with?

00:19:39.123 --> 00:19:42.497
It's okay, I know it isn't me.

00:19:42.531 --> 00:19:44.568
I've felt it for
a long while now.

00:19:44.602 --> 00:19:48.442
But, I... I want to hear
you say it for yourself.

00:19:48.476 --> 00:19:53.953
That way, I can let you
go knowing it's true.

00:19:53.987 --> 00:19:55.256
Merle: And then, maybe...

00:19:55.289 --> 00:19:57.661
maybe when I come
back in the next life,

00:19:57.695 --> 00:20:00.499
I can be someone
as brave as you are.

00:20:00.534 --> 00:20:03.673
Someone who's not afraid
to say how they feel.

00:20:17.667 --> 00:20:19.337
[pained gasp]

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.376
I'm so sorry, Merle.

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:25.784
You're right.
I... I-I, uh...

00:20:29.024 --> 00:20:32.531
I-It's Maam. I'm in
love with Maam!

00:20:49.197 --> 00:20:51.201
Popp: My Insignia of Avan...

00:20:51.234 --> 00:20:52.938
It's glowing!

00:20:52.971 --> 00:20:53.974
But, why would...

00:20:54.007 --> 00:20:55.577
What made it work?

00:20:56.613 --> 00:20:57.714
Popp [thought]:
Could it be...

00:20:57.747 --> 00:21:00.520
I don't... I never
had the courage.

00:21:01.623 --> 00:21:05.329
Popp [thought]: No way.
The power of my soul...

00:21:05.362 --> 00:21:08.703
has been Courage all along?

00:21:08.737 --> 00:21:11.074
Leona [thought]: So it
wasn't Dai after all...

00:21:11.108 --> 00:21:14.815
They say courage is found in
unlikely places... but Popp?

00:21:14.849 --> 00:21:17.688
Popp [thought]: Both of us were
hiding things, weren't we?

00:21:17.722 --> 00:21:19.558
I've been too afraid
of ruining things

00:21:19.591 --> 00:21:21.963
with Maam to tell
her how I feel.

00:21:21.996 --> 00:21:23.866
I guess you
were right, Merle.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.703
You really saw my soul...

00:21:32.784 --> 00:21:34.421
Popp: No, Merle.

00:21:34.454 --> 00:21:37.595
Come back. Please...
Just open your eyes!

00:21:37.628 --> 00:21:41.502
C'mon. You can't die.
You... You can't!

00:21:41.535 --> 00:21:43.005
I won't let you...

00:21:43.038 --> 00:21:48.516
Not for someone like me!

00:21:50.721 --> 00:21:53.225
Wait, Popp's a Mage,
but somehow...

00:21:53.258 --> 00:21:55.530
He's able to
use healing energy?

00:21:56.498 --> 00:22:00.038
Just like...
Like a Sage does!

00:23:38.268 --> 00:23:39.605
Narrator: Thanks
to Merle's insight,

00:23:39.638 --> 00:23:41.609
Popp has awakened
the power of his soul,

00:23:41.642 --> 00:23:43.513
and with the circle
of enchantment complete,

00:23:43.546 --> 00:23:44.615
the Disciples of Avan

00:23:44.649 --> 00:23:46.753
successfully cast
the Kaglimmer Spell.

00:23:46.786 --> 00:23:49.324
As the protective field
surrounding Vearn Palace falls,

00:23:49.357 --> 00:23:52.096
Dai and the others prepare for
their final confrontation...

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:55.102
but inside the flying fortress,
an adversary awaits

00:23:55.135 --> 00:23:57.875
who will take even the
Dark King himself by surprise.

00:23:57.908 --> 00:23:59.779
Learn their identity on
the next episode of

00:23:59.812 --> 00:24:01.916
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:01.949 --> 00:24:03.619
"The Last Challenge."
