WEBVTT

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.694
Here we go, Commandos! Charge!

00:01:55.263 --> 00:02:05.450
[battling grunts]

00:02:20.046 --> 00:02:21.984
Mystvearn: Well, well.
Lon Beruk.

00:02:22.017 --> 00:02:23.755
I'm surprised to see you here.

00:02:23.788 --> 00:02:24.723
Lon Beruk: And I'm surprised

00:02:24.756 --> 00:02:27.528
to hear you flapping
your mouth, Mystvearn.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.901
There's no point
in clamming up now.

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:32.204
After all,

00:02:32.238 --> 00:02:35.444
it's not as if I haven't
already heard your voice...

00:02:35.477 --> 00:02:38.617
Unless, of course, there's a
reason for you to conceal it.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.122
Has Vearn ordered
your silence?

00:02:41.155 --> 00:02:43.393
But you know,
I seem to remember

00:02:43.426 --> 00:02:46.666
that it's quite difficult
for you to disobey him.

00:02:53.714 --> 00:02:55.785
[enraged roar]

00:02:58.223 --> 00:03:00.326
And here we are again.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.266
Just like the
old days, isn't it?

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.805
How many decades
has it been by now?

00:03:05.838 --> 00:03:07.875
Time moves so quickly.

00:03:10.548 --> 00:03:13.319
Mystvearn: It was
nearly a century ago...

00:03:13.955 --> 00:03:15.390
In the banquet hall of

00:03:15.423 --> 00:03:19.364
the Dark King's Seventh
Palace of the Underworld.

00:03:39.438 --> 00:03:43.346
You seem troubled.
Something the matter?

00:03:44.215 --> 00:03:45.383
I'm leaving.

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:47.321
Mystvearn: [surprised gasp]

00:03:47.354 --> 00:03:49.158
Lon Beruk: In fact,
I should never have

00:03:49.191 --> 00:03:51.362
come here in the first place.

00:03:56.338 --> 00:03:58.242
Just a moment.

00:03:59.546 --> 00:04:03.486
Lon Beruk. I do
hope you understand

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.727
that I hold you
in the highest regard.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.963
If I had my way,

00:04:07.996 --> 00:04:11.403
you would stay here
and serve me permanently.

00:04:11.436 --> 00:04:14.576
This Staff of Edacity
you have forged...

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.116
It's truly the greatest
weapon in my arsenal,

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:21.155
Your other designs
are magnificent, too.

00:04:21.188 --> 00:04:23.393
By wielding
such a masterpiece,

00:04:23.426 --> 00:04:25.598
I will be unstoppable.

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:26.800
Lon Beruk: Well, you see,

00:04:26.834 --> 00:04:29.405
that's exactly what has
led me to this decision.

00:04:29.438 --> 00:04:31.142
My work is driven
by the desire

00:04:31.175 --> 00:04:33.179
to build the
ultimate weapon...

00:04:33.212 --> 00:04:35.451
and if I've already
created my masterpiece,

00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:37.454
why should I continue?

00:04:38.323 --> 00:04:41.262
I must. It will not end.

00:04:41.295 --> 00:04:45.003
Say I challenged you to
outdo yourself. Could you?

00:04:45.036 --> 00:04:46.640
The task is done.

00:04:46.674 --> 00:04:49.512
You may be the most powerful
being in the Underworld,

00:04:49.546 --> 00:04:51.717
and for now you may
be unstoppable...

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.023
but you will never
take my freedom.

00:04:55.057 --> 00:04:56.492
A rather bold claim.

00:04:56.526 --> 00:05:00.333
However, I can sense that
you are worthy of saying so.

00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:04.274
You don't hide your strength
as well as you think.

00:05:04.308 --> 00:05:06.412
Oh, come now. It's clear.

00:05:06.446 --> 00:05:07.849
Only a talented swordsman

00:05:07.883 --> 00:05:11.121
could create such
impressive weapons.

00:05:11.155 --> 00:05:13.359
You only work
as a weaponsmith...

00:05:13.392 --> 00:05:17.101
to keep such ability
a secret, do you not?

00:05:17.134 --> 00:05:21.543
To be blunt, now that I
possess the Staff of Edacity,

00:05:21.577 --> 00:05:24.115
the only thing I
really want you for

00:05:24.148 --> 00:05:26.786
is your skill with a blade.

00:05:28.156 --> 00:05:29.759
Vearn: This
impenetrable darkness

00:05:29.793 --> 00:05:32.665
has filled our skies
for long enough.

00:05:33.501 --> 00:05:34.970
The battle to free our realm

00:05:35.003 --> 00:05:38.142
from its wretched
clutches is approaching.

00:05:38.176 --> 00:05:39.846
For a swift victory,

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:43.854
I wish to have as many
powerful servants as possible.

00:05:45.156 --> 00:05:47.628
I'm offering you
a commanding position

00:05:47.662 --> 00:05:50.901
over my army once
it's been gathered.

00:05:54.208 --> 00:05:56.045
How does that sound?

00:05:59.953 --> 00:06:01.288
I'm not interested.

00:06:01.322 --> 00:06:03.760
Farewell, Dark King.

00:06:05.063 --> 00:06:06.399
Vearn: Calm yourself.

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:08.504
If we push, he'll lash out.

00:06:08.537 --> 00:06:12.010
He knows very well that
he cannot defeat me in combat,

00:06:12.043 --> 00:06:14.314
and yet he still has no fear.

00:06:14.348 --> 00:06:16.520
If we destroy him...

00:06:16.554 --> 00:06:19.091
it would be quite a waste.

00:06:20.327 --> 00:06:23.299
But Darklings live
for a very long time.

00:06:23.333 --> 00:06:25.738
Perhaps he will
change his mind.

00:06:36.727 --> 00:06:39.097
Lon Beruk: I can sense
you're out for blood.

00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:43.172
Is that King Vearn's will...

00:06:44.442 --> 00:06:46.111
Or is that your own?

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.804
Mystvearn [thought]:
W-Why wouldn't he dodge?

00:07:02.812 --> 00:07:05.852
I know I've insulted
your king's generosity...

00:07:05.885 --> 00:07:07.956
And that's the only
reason I allowed you

00:07:07.989 --> 00:07:09.425
to land this one blow.

00:07:09.458 --> 00:07:11.362
I may be willing
to wear this wound

00:07:11.395 --> 00:07:12.999
as my punishment, but...

00:07:13.032 --> 00:07:16.206
Hear this: if you decide
to strike me again,

00:07:16.239 --> 00:07:18.476
I'm not going to hold back.

00:07:22.752 --> 00:07:24.623
Mystvearn [thought]: He
refused the Dark King's offer

00:07:24.656 --> 00:07:27.662
because he wasn't willing
to sacrifice his freedom.

00:07:27.695 --> 00:07:31.102
So why would he side with
Dai and the humans now?

00:07:31.135 --> 00:07:35.043
Don't forget - you only
get one chance, Mystvearn.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.253
Mystvearn [thought]:
Such speed!

00:07:41.255 --> 00:07:47.434
[roaring]

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:48.771
I see.

00:07:48.804 --> 00:07:52.511
So the Purification Spell
requires all five Disciples.

00:07:53.814 --> 00:07:56.553
Hyunckel, wait.
Where are you going?

00:07:56.587 --> 00:07:58.355
I'm gonna take
down Mystvearn.

00:07:58.389 --> 00:08:02.297
He's not just going to let you
cast Kaglimmer now, is he?

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:03.634
Leona: But we need you here...

00:08:03.667 --> 00:08:04.770
What you need is time.

00:08:04.803 --> 00:08:07.508
And if I can hold him off,
then at least...

00:08:18.162 --> 00:08:19.332
Is that Mystvearn?

00:08:19.365 --> 00:08:20.535
He's fighting Lon Beruk!

00:08:20.568 --> 00:08:22.605
He's really on our side?

00:08:33.126 --> 00:08:35.096
Mystvearn: [growling]

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:36.566
[struggling grunts]

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:38.971
It looks like... they're
evenly matched in combat?

00:08:39.004 --> 00:08:40.040
Well, I mean,

00:08:40.073 --> 00:08:42.578
he did singlehandedly win
against the both of us.

00:08:42.612 --> 00:08:45.350
Hey! Everyone-
this is our chance.

00:08:45.384 --> 00:08:47.120
Let's get this over with.

00:08:48.122 --> 00:08:49.325
He's right.

00:08:49.358 --> 00:08:51.663
We should cast the spell before
the others run out of steam.

00:08:53.667 --> 00:08:55.303
Then here we go.

00:08:57.374 --> 00:08:59.546
Put me down! Why, you...

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.683
Take this! And that!

00:09:04.622 --> 00:09:05.958
Chiu: Well, look who it is!

00:09:05.991 --> 00:09:07.628
All right.
Welcome back, big guy!

00:09:07.661 --> 00:09:09.766
Princess Leona
told me the plan.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.803
I'll help you clear
out this riffraff

00:09:11.837 --> 00:09:14.208
while the Disciples
cast their spell.

00:09:14.241 --> 00:09:15.409
Listen up, troops!

00:09:15.443 --> 00:09:19.084
Our pal Crocodine here is
the former king of the beasts.

00:09:19.118 --> 00:09:21.723
So everybody give
him a proper salute.

00:09:23.026 --> 00:09:24.729
Crocodine [thought]: You've
gotta be kidding me...

00:09:24.762 --> 00:09:26.933
Did I get replaced by a mouse?

00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:28.469
Oh! While you were kidnapped,

00:09:28.503 --> 00:09:30.974
Lon Beruk made something
special for you.

00:09:33.479 --> 00:09:34.715
Did he?

00:09:35.884 --> 00:09:39.391
Crocodine, to unleash that
axe's power, give it a swing

00:09:39.424 --> 00:09:41.764
and call out
"Howling Inferno!"

00:09:41.797 --> 00:09:45.838
Right. Howling Inferno!

00:09:50.313 --> 00:09:52.117
Crocodine: Whoa! Not bad.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.286
Baduck: Powerful, huh?

00:09:53.319 --> 00:09:56.759
Lon calls it the Great Axe.
It's one of a kind!

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.129
Awesome.

00:09:58.162 --> 00:09:59.065
There are two commands.

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:01.035
"Inferno" unleashes
a Frizz-type attack,

00:10:01.068 --> 00:10:04.275
and "Detonation" is meant
to fire a Bang-type one.

00:10:04.308 --> 00:10:05.844
Now, try out the other move!

00:10:07.447 --> 00:10:09.151
Howl Detonation!

00:10:13.259 --> 00:10:14.261
Chiu: Nice shot!

00:10:14.295 --> 00:10:15.831
"Great Axe," indeed.

00:10:15.864 --> 00:10:19.038
It's like having my
very own Avan Strash.

00:10:19.071 --> 00:10:20.908
[screeching]

00:10:20.942 --> 00:10:22.745
Ah, Garuda. There you are.

00:10:22.778 --> 00:10:25.584
Old man? You can
take it easy now.

00:10:25.618 --> 00:10:27.822
Oh? Good.

00:10:27.855 --> 00:10:31.696
I was due for my
afternoon nap, anyway.

00:10:32.765 --> 00:10:35.737
As if! I'm only
getting started here.

00:10:37.575 --> 00:10:38.944
Frizzle!

00:10:40.647 --> 00:10:43.118
It looks like the five
of them are almost ready.

00:10:44.455 --> 00:10:45.356
Amy?

00:10:54.475 --> 00:10:55.978
This platform is sitting

00:10:56.012 --> 00:10:58.884
directly underneath
Vearn Palace, see?

00:10:58.918 --> 00:11:00.486
It's the perfect
place to conjure

00:11:00.521 --> 00:11:02.056
the circle of enchantment.

00:11:02.558 --> 00:11:03.560
Okay.

00:11:03.594 --> 00:11:05.631
Now, everyone
stand in a pentagon

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:08.435
and have your Insignia of
Avan at the ready.

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:13.345
Hyunckel: Amy?

00:11:14.816 --> 00:11:17.621
I wanted to return
your Dark Armor Spear.

00:11:17.655 --> 00:11:19.158
Lon Beruk fixed it.

00:11:19.191 --> 00:11:21.261
It still looks the same,
but he says that

00:11:21.295 --> 00:11:24.769
its attack and defense
power will be much stronger.

00:11:25.971 --> 00:11:28.042
But, Amy... I thought
you said you took it

00:11:28.076 --> 00:11:30.981
because you didn't
want me to fight anymore.

00:11:31.015 --> 00:11:34.421
But I don't want
you to die, either.

00:11:34.455 --> 00:11:38.162
After all, I know you would
still fight without it.

00:11:41.536 --> 00:11:45.844
So then fight...
and live. Okay?

00:11:51.756 --> 00:11:52.958
Hyunckel: Amdo!

00:12:17.708 --> 00:12:19.444
While I was locked away,

00:12:19.477 --> 00:12:21.516
I remembered what
you said to me.

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:22.752
Huh?

00:12:22.785 --> 00:12:24.856
Hyunckel: You looked
me in the eye and told me

00:12:24.889 --> 00:12:28.764
to stop walking into
death's arms so gladly.

00:12:28.798 --> 00:12:31.168
And those words kept
me from giving up.

00:12:31.201 --> 00:12:33.840
They made me want to hold
onto any chance there was

00:12:33.874 --> 00:12:37.014
to keep living,
no matter how small.

00:12:37.047 --> 00:12:39.084
I give you my thanks.

00:12:40.487 --> 00:12:41.890
Well, that's good to hear.

00:12:41.924 --> 00:12:44.395
I'm glad that I managed
to get through to you...

00:12:44.428 --> 00:12:47.702
Only... Our fight is
just getting started here.

00:12:47.735 --> 00:12:51.341
So why don't you try thanking
me again after we've won it?

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.853
Amy... You wanna
wrap this up soon?

00:12:56.886 --> 00:12:59.692
Leona: I'd like to explain
the spell if you don't mind.

00:12:59.726 --> 00:13:02.196
Right! I'm so sorry,
Your Highness.

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:06.204
Amy...

00:13:13.152 --> 00:13:16.526
All right, everybody
put on your Insignias.

00:13:16.559 --> 00:13:17.662
Leona: Kaglimmer is already

00:13:17.695 --> 00:13:20.500
a powerful Purification
Spell by itself...

00:13:20.534 --> 00:13:23.172
but with the Mysticite in
our pendants activated and

00:13:23.206 --> 00:13:26.713
placed at five points around
this circle of enchantment,

00:13:26.746 --> 00:13:29.451
the spell's abilities
will be amplified.

00:13:30.152 --> 00:13:31.589
If everything goes as planned,

00:13:31.623 --> 00:13:34.295
it should create enough
magical energy to take down

00:13:34.328 --> 00:13:37.367
the protective field
surrounding Vearn Palace.

00:13:38.636 --> 00:13:40.039
Once it's down,

00:13:40.072 --> 00:13:43.313
we'll be able to get inside and
stop Vearn once and for all.

00:13:43.346 --> 00:13:44.882
So, what do we do next?

00:13:44.916 --> 00:13:47.220
Is there like a
chant or something?

00:13:47.253 --> 00:13:49.358
You can leave casting
the spell to me.

00:13:49.391 --> 00:13:52.197
Meanwhile, all the rest
of you need to do is

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.236
unleash the power in
your soul, one at a time.

00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:56.272
And after that,

00:13:56.305 --> 00:13:58.577
the light produced
by each of our Insignias

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:01.315
is going to fuse together
and form a pillar that will

00:14:01.348 --> 00:14:04.321
stretch all the way
up to the palace gate.

00:14:04.354 --> 00:14:06.258
A pillar of light, huh?

00:14:06.291 --> 00:14:07.160
You've got it.

00:14:07.193 --> 00:14:10.299
Now, everyone
join hands - us first.

00:14:10.333 --> 00:14:12.605
Leona: When it's your
turn, clear your mind,

00:14:12.638 --> 00:14:13.907
focus on your intention,

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.378
then pass that
energy onto the next.

00:14:17.514 --> 00:14:20.486
Popp [thought]: Great...
That means I'm last.

00:14:21.656 --> 00:14:23.694
Popp: Umm... What if...

00:14:23.727 --> 00:14:26.398
And I'm just asking, here...

00:14:26.432 --> 00:14:30.440
But say one of us can't
get our Insignia to glow...

00:14:30.473 --> 00:14:32.612
Uh, what would happen then?

00:14:32.645 --> 00:14:33.514
Really?

00:14:33.547 --> 00:14:34.849
Are you trying to jinx this?

00:14:34.883 --> 00:14:37.120
Don't say stuff like that.

00:14:37.153 --> 00:14:39.491
If we can't summon
all five lights,

00:14:39.525 --> 00:14:43.566
then the Kaglimmer will only
be using my Magic Power...

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.906
And it probably won't be
strong enough, in that case.

00:14:47.541 --> 00:14:49.011
Got it.

00:14:49.044 --> 00:14:51.516
It's okay. I think
we're all a little nervous.

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:54.121
She's right. None of us
have done this before...

00:14:54.154 --> 00:14:56.425
But worrying won't change that.

00:14:56.458 --> 00:14:57.728
Empty your mind.

00:14:57.761 --> 00:15:00.132
Yeah, I said I got it.
Thank you.

00:15:00.834 --> 00:15:03.172
Come on, let's do this thing!

00:15:03.206 --> 00:15:08.016
[roaring]

00:15:08.049 --> 00:15:12.256
Northern Grand Blade!

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:17.200
Nova: These things aren't
so tough. Not in this state.

00:15:17.233 --> 00:15:19.639
Crocodine: Howling Inferno!

00:15:19.672 --> 00:15:21.308
Nova: Hey, Crocodine!

00:15:21.342 --> 00:15:24.147
Crocodine: Ah, Nova.
They go down easy, don't they?

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.853
Yeah, we'll be through
the rest in no time.

00:15:26.887 --> 00:15:27.554
[roaring]

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.428
Now! Flatten him, troops!

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:35.537
So, did somebody take
down Mystvearn already?

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.274
I haven't seen him in a while.

00:15:37.307 --> 00:15:38.275
Not yet.

00:15:38.309 --> 00:15:40.647
He's up there - flashes
by every now and then.

00:15:58.884 --> 00:16:01.222
Those two are on
a whole other level.

00:16:01.255 --> 00:16:03.325
Lon's quite impressive.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.171
Oh, great holy light...

00:16:09.204 --> 00:16:11.007
With thy blessed strength...

00:16:11.041 --> 00:16:14.682
Please help us to drive
away the shadow of evil.

00:16:48.617 --> 00:16:51.756
Oh, wow... There really
is a pillar of light.

00:16:55.898 --> 00:16:57.901
Now, your turn, Dai.

00:16:57.935 --> 00:16:59.004
Here goes.

00:16:59.037 --> 00:17:00.875
Focus my intention...

00:17:00.908 --> 00:17:03.078
And pass along the energy...

00:17:03.111 --> 00:17:04.516
Leona: Relax.

00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:06.819
You don't need to
push yourself like that.

00:17:06.852 --> 00:17:09.257
Just breathe
and empty your mind.

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:12.129
Leona: It's not the
kind of thing you can force.

00:17:26.826 --> 00:17:29.397
Oh... It worked!

00:17:30.165 --> 00:17:31.134
I really did it!

00:17:31.168 --> 00:17:32.504
Hey, that wasn't so hard.

00:17:32.538 --> 00:17:35.109
So, the power
of my soul is blue!

00:17:35.142 --> 00:17:36.545
That's right.

00:17:39.084 --> 00:17:41.589
Cool. Right.
You're next, Hyunckel.

00:17:48.469 --> 00:17:49.738
[roaring]

00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:57.821
Lon Beruk [thought]:
Well, we're evenly matched.

00:17:57.855 --> 00:18:00.760
At least that means I
can hold him in a stalemate.

00:18:01.428 --> 00:18:02.397
Mystvearn [thought]: What...

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:04.134
What are those
pillars of light?

00:18:04.167 --> 00:18:07.073
They must be trying
to breach the palace.

00:18:07.106 --> 00:18:08.543
Not on my watch.

00:18:08.576 --> 00:18:11.481
Lon Beruk: You're staying
right here, Mystvearn.

00:18:23.038 --> 00:18:25.777
Popp [thought]:
This is it... my turn.

00:18:29.852 --> 00:18:31.355
As long as I'm
still standing,

00:18:31.388 --> 00:18:34.228
you're stuck sparring
with me - like it or not.

00:18:34.261 --> 00:18:36.900
I won't allow you
to interfere with them.

00:18:36.933 --> 00:18:40.507
Mystvearn: [chuckling]

00:18:40.541 --> 00:18:43.178
Time has turned
you into a fool.

00:18:43.212 --> 00:18:45.784
Do you really believe
that just holding me at bay

00:18:45.817 --> 00:18:49.490
is going to give these
pathetic humans a chance?

00:18:49.525 --> 00:18:50.426
Of course.

00:18:50.459 --> 00:18:53.265
Why else would you
be getting so chatty?

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:56.204
Especially if you were forbidden
to let me hear your voice.

00:18:56.237 --> 00:18:58.744
Mystvearn: Hearing my voice
will be of no consequence,

00:18:58.777 --> 00:19:00.179
and your skill with a sword

00:19:00.213 --> 00:19:02.283
won't save you
from what's coming.

00:19:02.317 --> 00:19:05.422
You weren't the only one
playing a distraction.

00:19:05.456 --> 00:19:07.160
Mystvearn: You chose
the wrong side.

00:19:07.193 --> 00:19:08.963
Now, you'll perish with them.

00:19:08.996 --> 00:19:10.265
W-What is that?!

00:19:11.101 --> 00:19:12.938
Zaboera: [devious cackle]

00:19:13.974 --> 00:19:16.579
There's no mistaking
that laugh...

00:19:21.388 --> 00:19:24.862
Zaboera. The Mystic
Bishop shows his face.

00:19:26.398 --> 00:19:27.935
You're behind the times.

00:19:27.968 --> 00:19:31.709
I've been promoted to High
Commander of the Dark Army.

00:19:31.743 --> 00:19:36.519
Years of humiliating labor can
yield very satisfying rewards.

00:19:36.552 --> 00:19:37.888
Crocodine: Whatever your title,

00:19:37.921 --> 00:19:41.428
it's far too late to turn
the tide of this battle.

00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:43.432
Now, why don't you
come down here and

00:19:43.466 --> 00:19:46.539
let me reap a "satisfying
reward" of my own?

00:19:46.573 --> 00:19:49.778
Mystvearn: Zaboera, this is your
chance to prove your loyalty.

00:19:49.812 --> 00:19:52.718
Do as we planned, and
wipe out these humans...

00:19:52.751 --> 00:19:54.321
Without mercy.

00:19:54.354 --> 00:19:57.127
It would be my pleasure...
Commander Mystvearn.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.529
Bang!

00:20:07.848 --> 00:20:09.518
This is not good...

00:20:15.998 --> 00:20:17.266
What are those things?!

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:18.837
Zaboera: [chuckling]

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.540
I call them Magic Capsules-

00:20:20.573 --> 00:20:23.947
my own variation of
the Magic Cylinder...

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.517
They're quite a marvel.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:29.224
Each one is able to
contain dozens of monsters.

00:20:29.257 --> 00:20:30.359
What?!

00:20:30.392 --> 00:20:31.862
Zaboera: And speaking
of marvels...

00:20:31.896 --> 00:20:34.568
I've loaded these
with terrifying creatures-

00:20:34.602 --> 00:20:37.808
the likes of which
you've never seen before.

00:20:37.841 --> 00:20:38.777
You mean...

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:42.016
Zaboera: I do... And now
you're all finished.

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:43.185
Oh, no...

00:20:43.218 --> 00:20:44.788
Now, Popp! Hurry!

00:20:45.156 --> 00:20:45.957
R-Right.

00:20:49.531 --> 00:20:51.502
Pop [thought]:
Help me out here, Gods.

00:20:52.203 --> 00:20:54.307
[roaring]

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:58.115
Behold, my terrifying
beasts of the Underworld.

00:20:58.148 --> 00:20:59.317
Gush!

00:21:11.007 --> 00:21:16.519
[straining]

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.992
[straining]

00:21:37.026 --> 00:21:38.028
Uh, Popp?

00:21:38.062 --> 00:21:38.996
Come on...

00:21:40.032 --> 00:21:42.070
[straining]

00:21:42.103 --> 00:21:43.773
What's happening? Let's go.

00:21:45.109 --> 00:21:46.545
I knew it...

00:21:47.615 --> 00:21:50.854
I knew.... this
wouldn't work...

00:22:00.172 --> 00:22:03.512
Popp: I can't...
I can't do it.

00:23:37.634 --> 00:23:40.005
Narrator: Having failed
to set his Insignia alight,

00:23:40.038 --> 00:23:42.911
Popp's worst nightmare
has come to pass...

00:23:42.945 --> 00:23:46.050
And as Zaboera's horde of
Underworld monsters descends,

00:23:46.084 --> 00:23:47.688
the battle of Lori Valley

00:23:47.721 --> 00:23:50.059
threatens to turn against
Queen Flora's army.

00:23:50.092 --> 00:23:52.931
With time running out and
his friends counting on him,

00:23:52.965 --> 00:23:56.405
can Popp overcome his doubts and
unleash the power of his soul?

00:23:56.438 --> 00:23:57.574
Find out next time on

00:23:57.607 --> 00:24:00.045

Great Purification Spell".
