WEBVTT

00:02:07.622 --> 00:02:09.425
[roaring]

00:02:18.076 --> 00:02:21.583
[roaring]

00:02:26.192 --> 00:02:28.429
Something just severed
my connection with Popp.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.574
All my friends...
What's happening up there?

00:02:41.657 --> 00:02:43.026
Where... Where am I?

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:44.729
Hyunckel: Nowhere good.

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:46.767
You can say that again.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.105
We definitely didn't
wake up in paradise.

00:02:49.138 --> 00:02:50.207
Just the opposite.

00:02:50.241 --> 00:02:51.543
What is this place?

00:02:58.023 --> 00:02:59.458
As far as I can tell...

00:02:59.492 --> 00:03:01.830
we must be in the heart
of Vearn Palace itself.

00:03:01.863 --> 00:03:04.168
We fell from the very
top of the tower...

00:03:04.201 --> 00:03:05.638
And now we're trapped again.

00:03:05.671 --> 00:03:07.340
How do we escape?

00:03:09.646 --> 00:03:12.417
[roaring]

00:03:15.124 --> 00:03:16.693
I've got an idea...

00:03:16.726 --> 00:03:18.997
Refractor Fist!

00:03:26.514 --> 00:03:28.884
[roaring]

00:03:34.896 --> 00:03:35.799
It's not going to work.

00:03:35.832 --> 00:03:37.836
The walls of the heart
must be made from

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:40.441
the same stuff that
the Dark Force Reactor was.

00:03:40.474 --> 00:03:42.712
It can absorb any
Magic Power we throw at it,

00:03:42.746 --> 00:03:44.850
and it can probably
regenerate, too.

00:03:44.883 --> 00:03:46.252
But no living thing can absorb

00:03:46.286 --> 00:03:48.891
an Overheal spell -
it's impossible.

00:03:50.928 --> 00:03:53.399
Either way, seeing as
we've all returned to normal,

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:54.869
I believe it's a
fair assumption that

00:03:54.903 --> 00:03:57.508
either Dai has struck a critical
blow against the Dark King...

00:03:57.542 --> 00:04:00.581
or he's somehow severed
the flow of his Magic Power.

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:02.450
Avan: With a battle
as fierce as this,

00:04:02.484 --> 00:04:04.722
it's only a matter of time
before the palace shatters...

00:04:04.756 --> 00:04:06.326
And Vearn won't
have the Magic Power

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:07.695
to hold it together anymore.

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:09.899
When it happens, we'll
plummet to the surface

00:04:09.933 --> 00:04:12.738
along with this chamber
and be killed on impact.

00:04:14.474 --> 00:04:16.112
Popp: You've gotta
be kidding me...

00:04:16.145 --> 00:04:18.717
We've just gone from
one trap to another?

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.936
Popp: No way. We're
not going out like that...

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:29.305
Not if I can help it.

00:04:29.338 --> 00:04:30.174
How about this?

00:04:30.207 --> 00:04:32.010
Medroa!

00:04:41.396 --> 00:04:43.901
C'mon... That didn't
even leave a mark?

00:04:43.935 --> 00:04:45.137
Seriously?

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.742
This thing absorbs magic - even
a spell as tough as Medroa.

00:04:47.775 --> 00:04:49.813
All you're going to
do is tire yourself out

00:04:49.846 --> 00:04:51.081
if you keep using it.

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.224
Whoa, take it easy...

00:04:55.257 --> 00:04:57.294
U-uh... I'll be okay.

00:04:57.328 --> 00:05:00.401
Just woozy from
casting that spell.

00:05:00.434 --> 00:05:03.306
But don't worry,
my brain's still intact...

00:05:06.847 --> 00:05:09.753
Popp: Look: Nothing's
invulnerable, not even this...

00:05:09.786 --> 00:05:12.390
There must be a way
to break out of here!

00:05:13.393 --> 00:05:15.029
Dai's up there right now...

00:05:17.167 --> 00:05:19.037
A fate worse than ours.

00:05:21.944 --> 00:05:23.079
He's not giving up.

00:05:23.112 --> 00:05:25.383
He's fighting harder than
ever, risking everything...

00:05:25.417 --> 00:05:26.853
Everything, and for what?

00:05:26.887 --> 00:05:29.525
For all of his friends
to get stuck down here -

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:32.865
blown to kingdom come
in some stupid, slimy trap?

00:05:42.118 --> 00:05:44.822
He's right, damnit!

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:54.374
We've all tried
our Aura attacks,

00:05:54.408 --> 00:05:55.711
and if they won't work...

00:05:55.744 --> 00:05:56.546
Nothing will.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.149
Look again, Big Guy.

00:06:00.053 --> 00:06:02.324
Popp: You see? I told
you it's not invincible.

00:06:02.357 --> 00:06:03.694
Magic Power might
have no effect,

00:06:03.728 --> 00:06:05.564
but Aura did some damage.

00:06:05.597 --> 00:06:08.837
There's a way -
we just need more!

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.476
All we need to do is
hit the wall with an attack

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.914
that'll make a hole big
enough for us to get through.

00:06:13.948 --> 00:06:16.620
Then we can escape with a Zoom
spell before it heals itself.

00:06:16.653 --> 00:06:17.756
Even if you are right,

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:19.224
the amount of power
it would require...

00:06:19.257 --> 00:06:20.661
None of us have
that energy left.

00:06:20.695 --> 00:06:22.966
The only thing that was
strong enough to pierce

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:24.335
the heart was Dai's Doruora.

00:06:24.368 --> 00:06:26.105
Who here can match that?

00:06:27.508 --> 00:06:28.811
Crocodine: If that's the case,

00:06:28.844 --> 00:06:31.683
then simple destructive
power can't breach this wall.

00:06:31.716 --> 00:06:34.388
I'll bet the Dragon Knight's
Doruora was able to do so

00:06:34.421 --> 00:06:36.459
because of its
overwhelming Aura energy...

00:06:36.492 --> 00:06:38.664
Our combined strength
isn't enough.

00:06:44.341 --> 00:06:47.081
Popp [thought]: Have we really
crossed off all our options?

00:06:47.114 --> 00:06:50.420
There is something, I know it.
Something we're forgetting.

00:06:50.453 --> 00:06:52.759
It might not be as
great as Doruora, but...

00:06:52.792 --> 00:06:54.596
maybe it doesn't need to be.

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:57.067
As long as it still
fires Aura at full power

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.639
it should do the trick, right?

00:07:01.677 --> 00:07:03.880
That's it... I've got it!

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.191
We hit it with a Grand Cross.

00:07:09.225 --> 00:07:10.528
You mean Hyunckel's thing?

00:07:10.561 --> 00:07:11.830
Yes... Yes, I see!

00:07:11.863 --> 00:07:12.932
That could work.

00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:14.068
Don't be ridiculous.

00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:16.907
In Hyunckel's condition,
he can barely even stand.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:17.742
If he tries, it could...

00:07:17.775 --> 00:07:20.614
Relax! I don't
want him to do it.

00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:23.186
Hyunckel didn't invent that
skill. Somebody taught him.

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:24.856
I want them to do it.

00:07:26.727 --> 00:07:27.795
Bingo.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.471
The one who originally
wielded the Grand Cross

00:07:32.506 --> 00:07:35.511
is none other than
Master Avan himself.

00:07:35.544 --> 00:07:38.049
You remember how
it's done. Master?

00:07:39.485 --> 00:07:41.790
Popp: Come on,
I know you do! Let's go.

00:07:44.462 --> 00:07:46.398
[laughing]

00:07:46.432 --> 00:07:47.702
Brilliant!

00:07:47.736 --> 00:07:49.906
I remember indeed, Popp.
Nicely done. Quick thinking.

00:07:49.939 --> 00:07:52.310
You put that together even
faster than I expected.

00:07:52.344 --> 00:07:55.316
It's been quite a while since
the last time I used this,

00:07:55.349 --> 00:07:56.185
but very well.

00:07:56.218 --> 00:07:57.522
I can take things from here.

00:07:57.555 --> 00:07:59.425
One quick go. Wish me luck!

00:07:59.458 --> 00:08:02.364
Popp: All right!
Take it away, Master Avan!

00:08:02.397 --> 00:08:04.135
Avan... Avan... Avan!

00:08:04.168 --> 00:08:05.705
Hyunckel: Cut it out.

00:08:05.738 --> 00:08:07.942
You do not want him to use it.

00:08:07.976 --> 00:08:10.414
Not unless you want to
lose him all over again.

00:08:10.447 --> 00:08:11.248
Popp: Uh...

00:08:12.484 --> 00:08:14.555
Avan taught the attack,
not the technique.

00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:15.758
A traditional Grand Cross

00:08:15.791 --> 00:08:17.494
is only performed
as a last resort

00:08:17.528 --> 00:08:19.866
when a warrior is unable
to use their sword.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.606
You only use it if
you have no other option.

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:25.711
That's a skill he knows.
The rest is mine.

00:08:25.744 --> 00:08:26.846
Hyunckel: And the only person

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.553
who knows how to
do it my way is me.

00:08:29.586 --> 00:08:31.021
Or more accurately...

00:08:31.055 --> 00:08:34.094
I'm the only one who knows how
to do it like that and survive.

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:37.000
Avan: Yes, that's true.

00:08:37.033 --> 00:08:38.737
Avan: Grand Cross
is so volatile,

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.175
it can easily become
a self-destruct attack.

00:08:41.208 --> 00:08:43.479
To unleash such a fearsome
thing at full power

00:08:43.514 --> 00:08:44.783
and walk away unscathed...

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:46.887
There's certainly no
denying it, Hyunckel.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.724
You've cultivated
a miraculous skill

00:08:48.757 --> 00:08:51.295
in the years you've
wandered the battlefield.

00:08:51.328 --> 00:08:55.069
I might go as far as to liken
it to the might of the gods.

00:08:55.103 --> 00:08:57.675
It's very possible that
I won't be as successful...

00:08:57.709 --> 00:09:00.446
but if there's ever been a
time to try for the impossible,

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.917
I'd say this is it.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:02.618
M-Master, wait!

00:09:02.651 --> 00:09:03.820
Both: You can't.

00:09:03.854 --> 00:09:05.624
Hyunckel: That's not a
chance you need to take.

00:09:05.657 --> 00:09:07.227
Allow me - and
just stand aside.

00:09:07.261 --> 00:09:09.265
Maam: It doesn't matter
who takes the chance.

00:09:09.298 --> 00:09:10.467
There has to be another way.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.469
But there isn't.

00:09:11.503 --> 00:09:12.739
If it means saving
the rest of us,

00:09:12.772 --> 00:09:15.276
then somebody has to
put themselves on the line.

00:09:15.309 --> 00:09:16.713
It's the only move we've got.

00:09:16.747 --> 00:09:18.015
You don't know that.

00:09:25.496 --> 00:09:27.101
There's no more time to argue.

00:09:27.134 --> 00:09:28.069
No. End of discussion.

00:09:28.102 --> 00:09:34.583
Hym: [snarling]

00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:35.952
L-Little Hym, he's...

00:09:35.985 --> 00:09:37.220
O-Oh man...

00:09:39.458 --> 00:09:41.696
I remember that
technique of yours well.

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.400
Hym: Hard to forget
the thing somebody

00:09:43.433 --> 00:09:45.571
almost does you in with.

00:09:45.604 --> 00:09:47.975
Now, I'm only imitating here...

00:09:48.009 --> 00:09:51.014
But I think it went a
little something like this!

00:09:58.062 --> 00:10:00.801
Popp [thought]: Hym can
do a Grand Cross?

00:10:02.772 --> 00:10:05.645
Avan [thought]:
His body can't take it!

00:10:05.678 --> 00:10:07.147
Hyunckel: It's all right,
Hym. That's enough!

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:09.586
I'll do this myself.
Just leave it to me!

00:10:09.619 --> 00:10:10.721
Hym: No can do.

00:10:10.754 --> 00:10:11.990
If you die here,

00:10:12.023 --> 00:10:14.462
I'll never be able to
settle our score, will I?

00:10:14.495 --> 00:10:16.833
You'll never settle
it this way, either!

00:10:17.467 --> 00:10:19.839
Hym, please.

00:10:19.872 --> 00:10:22.812
Hym: If I'm being honest,
I'll tell you this...

00:10:22.845 --> 00:10:25.651
Hym: I didn't think
much of you humans at first.

00:10:25.684 --> 00:10:27.421
But you aren't
so bad after all.

00:10:27.454 --> 00:10:30.493
Matter of fact, I've taken a
liking to you and your friends.

00:10:30.527 --> 00:10:32.565
Believe me, it
surprises me too,

00:10:32.599 --> 00:10:35.236
but there's something to
admire in everyone here.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:38.777
What I like most is, you're all
willing to do the stupid thing.

00:10:38.811 --> 00:10:41.650
You'll put yourself in harm's
way to protect your bonds.

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:44.990
In that sense, you're
just like my old comrades!

00:10:45.023 --> 00:10:48.564
I-I don't... I don't want to
see any of you sad ever again,

00:10:48.597 --> 00:10:52.003
so I promise I'll
get the job done!

00:10:53.039 --> 00:10:54.074
No, stop!

00:10:54.108 --> 00:10:56.813
Don't underestimate
me, Hyunckel.

00:10:57.447 --> 00:10:59.418
I know what I'm doing...

00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:01.355
If you're immortal...

00:11:01.388 --> 00:11:03.560
Hym: Th-Then that makes me...

00:11:03.593 --> 00:11:07.535
That makes me immortal as well!

00:11:07.569 --> 00:11:08.904
[roaring]

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:25.804
Both: Now! Zoom!

00:11:38.195 --> 00:11:39.799
[screaming]

00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:43.405
[groaning]

00:11:51.121 --> 00:11:53.960
Finally. The fall
of Vearn Palace.

00:11:58.069 --> 00:12:01.576
Chiu: Y-You... You sure went out
in a blaze of glory, Little Hym.

00:12:01.609 --> 00:12:04.014
We'll never forget
what you've done!

00:12:06.986 --> 00:12:09.893
From this day forth, Number
twelve is permanently retired.

00:12:09.926 --> 00:12:13.065
Thus ends his service
with the Beast King Commandos!

00:12:18.409 --> 00:12:21.449
Hey, congrats. So now that
you're retired, what's next?

00:12:21.482 --> 00:12:22.851
Travel the world?

00:12:22.885 --> 00:12:26.291
Shut up. He didn't even make
sure that I'm actually dead.

00:12:26.325 --> 00:12:29.197
I mean, it was a nice
speech, but at least check.

00:12:47.702 --> 00:12:49.170
Baduck: Hey!

00:12:50.407 --> 00:12:52.545
They're alive! Popp! Maam!

00:12:52.578 --> 00:12:54.114
Princess Leona!

00:12:54.148 --> 00:12:56.018
[cheering]

00:12:56.052 --> 00:12:58.022
Bowson: Is everyone okay?!

00:12:58.056 --> 00:13:00.393
It's Queen Flora
and the others!

00:13:03.232 --> 00:13:04.936
That was quite
a fall, Princess.

00:13:04.969 --> 00:13:06.639
No kidding.
Sorry I worried you.

00:13:06.673 --> 00:13:07.675
Where's your shirt?

00:13:07.708 --> 00:13:08.643
Long story.

00:13:08.676 --> 00:13:09.612
[amazed laugh]

00:13:09.645 --> 00:13:11.048
Happy to see
you made it back.

00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:12.017
Thanks.

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.154
I mean it. I thought
I'd never see you again.

00:13:14.187 --> 00:13:16.191
Guess I should know better.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.431
It was a real group effort.

00:13:23.038 --> 00:13:25.443
Thank heavens you all made
it out of there safely.

00:13:25.477 --> 00:13:28.851
Avan: Agreed. We were cutting
it even closer than I realized.

00:13:28.884 --> 00:13:30.420
Talk about good timing, huh?

00:13:30.453 --> 00:13:31.923
Yes, quite so.

00:13:32.892 --> 00:13:34.327
Flora: Huh?

00:13:36.431 --> 00:13:37.601
Is that you, Avan?

00:13:37.634 --> 00:13:39.037
I-I think so?

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:45.551
Flora? That's not, uh... not
how I expected you'd react...

00:13:45.584 --> 00:13:46.987
Oh, that's right.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.489
She didn't know that Master
Avan's been alive all this time.

00:13:48.523 --> 00:13:49.993
She must've thought
she was seeing a ghost.

00:13:50.026 --> 00:13:52.397
I'm sorry, I thought
you liked surprises.

00:13:57.808 --> 00:13:59.344
Wait. Where's Dai?

00:14:00.079 --> 00:14:01.949
Tell me what happened to Dai.

00:14:08.764 --> 00:14:11.401
I guess, he's...
still up there.

00:14:14.875 --> 00:14:16.445
He's on his own.

00:14:16.478 --> 00:14:19.485
Popp: With what he's up against,
we weren't much use anyway.

00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:20.453
Even if we could help,

00:14:20.486 --> 00:14:22.858
he's in a place that
none of us can reach.

00:14:22.892 --> 00:14:24.227
It shouldn't be like this.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.633
I shouldn't have listened
when he told us back off...

00:14:26.666 --> 00:14:28.302
I should've done more!

00:14:31.676 --> 00:14:33.547
[weeping]

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.753
Hyunckel: You've done plenty,
Popp. Be proud of yourself.

00:14:36.786 --> 00:14:40.159
Each of us gave him all that
we had, and we got him there.

00:14:40.192 --> 00:14:42.064
It's why we've
pulled off so many miracles

00:14:42.097 --> 00:14:43.567
beyond our abilities.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.606
It's come at great cost,
but it's why we're still here.

00:14:46.639 --> 00:14:49.444
It's also why Dai is able
to carry on the fight -

00:14:49.477 --> 00:14:51.281
why he'll win.

00:14:51.314 --> 00:14:54.387
He's proud of you.
All of us are.

00:14:59.264 --> 00:15:00.132
Popp: Right.

00:15:02.036 --> 00:15:03.106
Y-You're right.

00:15:03.139 --> 00:15:04.976
Mr. Beast: It will
make a splendid legend.

00:15:05.009 --> 00:15:07.147
"Thus, lifted by the
hope of his friends,

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.151
the Hero ascended
to the heavens..."

00:15:09.184 --> 00:15:12.023
Now all we can do is wait
to see if he'll return.

00:15:12.056 --> 00:15:14.696
And believe that in
the end, Dai will win.

00:15:14.729 --> 00:15:16.031
There's no doubt about that.

00:15:16.065 --> 00:15:18.937
Master Dai will be
victorious. He always is.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:21.208
Even the Dark King
himself can't overcome

00:15:21.241 --> 00:15:24.548
the son of the
mighty war god Baran.

00:15:24.582 --> 00:15:25.717
You're done, Vearn!

00:15:25.751 --> 00:15:26.451
No!

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:37.240
Popp [thought]: Win.
You have to do it, Dai!

00:15:37.273 --> 00:15:39.879
Take him out and
then come back to us.

00:15:39.913 --> 00:15:42.552
I don't care what you
look like - I mean it.

00:15:42.585 --> 00:15:44.188
Just please, come back.

00:15:44.221 --> 00:15:47.393
Don't let this be
how we say goodbye, pal.

00:15:59.786 --> 00:16:01.354
Dai: The Surface World?

00:16:02.524 --> 00:16:04.595
Where's Vearn?!

00:16:04.628 --> 00:16:05.429
He's still alive... I feel it.

00:16:05.463 --> 00:16:07.734
I have to find him -
he can't win!

00:16:12.811 --> 00:16:18.990
True Vearn: [pained groaning]

00:16:22.364 --> 00:16:25.369
I... I can't...
can't do this.

00:16:25.402 --> 00:16:27.340
In such a compromised state...

00:16:29.646 --> 00:16:32.416
Perhaps if I still had
both of my arms, but...

00:16:33.987 --> 00:16:37.493
No. It would
still change nothing.

00:16:37.528 --> 00:16:40.199
Even with both arms,
the outcome would be the same.

00:16:40.233 --> 00:16:42.505
He's transformed
into a feral beast,

00:16:42.538 --> 00:16:43.607
sacrificing all he has,

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.579
including his very
nature to claim victory.

00:16:48.082 --> 00:16:51.321
I'll win, but I must
sacrifice all I have, as well.

00:16:52.558 --> 00:17:03.045
[roaring]

00:17:03.078 --> 00:17:10.192
[terrifying howl]

00:17:11.996 --> 00:17:14.300
Velzar: What an
intense wave of energy.

00:17:14.334 --> 00:17:16.939
Has Vearn finally done it?

00:17:16.973 --> 00:17:20.112
He's unleashed the power
of the Sovereign Eye!

00:17:20.145 --> 00:17:22.551
Is his foe
truly that powerful?!

00:17:22.585 --> 00:17:26.324
That puny child of
the Dragon Knight?!

00:17:28.796 --> 00:17:29.932
What is this?

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:31.870
Where's all this
energy coming from?

00:17:31.903 --> 00:17:33.606
What have you done, Vearn?!

00:17:42.925 --> 00:17:44.327
Vearn.

00:17:45.664 --> 00:17:46.799
Well done, Dai...

00:17:46.832 --> 00:17:49.104
Your father would
be so pleased.

00:17:49.137 --> 00:17:52.310
You've taken ahold of a power
far beyond this realm...

00:17:52.344 --> 00:17:54.515
One that eclipses my own.

00:17:56.017 --> 00:17:58.590
To defeat the frenzied
beast you've become,

00:17:58.623 --> 00:18:02.396
I must transform into
something even more ferocious.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.338
True Vearn: Hadlar once
walked the path of no return.

00:18:06.372 --> 00:18:08.843
For his courage he
was rewarded with a power

00:18:08.876 --> 00:18:10.781
rivaling that
of my former body.

00:18:10.814 --> 00:18:12.884
I shall be, too!

00:18:14.454 --> 00:18:16.960
True Vearn: Even if it
means I cannot turn back,

00:18:16.993 --> 00:18:20.032
that's a small price
to pay for victory.

00:18:20.065 --> 00:18:23.706
I'd give my entire
kingdom for it!

00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:38.268
[pained yell]

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.617
[roaring]

00:19:07.994 --> 00:19:09.363
You hit hard.

00:19:09.397 --> 00:19:11.803
This is what your true form
really looks like, isn't it?

00:19:11.836 --> 00:19:16.512
This is a vessel. My true
form is here at the head.

00:19:16.545 --> 00:19:19.317
The behemoth I'm attached
to is a final measure.

00:19:19.351 --> 00:19:22.691
A ruthless creature I keep
locked away in my Third Eye -

00:19:22.724 --> 00:19:24.094
my Sovereign Eye.

00:19:24.127 --> 00:19:28.369
If there's a force to
match a Dragonoid,

00:19:28.402 --> 00:19:30.240
it's the Sovereign Supreme.

00:19:30.273 --> 00:19:31.676
The Sovereign Supreme?

00:19:31.709 --> 00:19:33.378
I've seen this before!

00:19:34.948 --> 00:19:36.519
That's it!
It looks just like...

00:19:36.552 --> 00:19:38.523
like Sovereign Rock Castle!

00:19:40.359 --> 00:19:41.562
True Vearn: Very good.

00:19:41.595 --> 00:19:43.332
The castle's
designed to resemble

00:19:43.365 --> 00:19:46.672
my most terrifying form of all!

00:19:46.705 --> 00:19:48.242
I'm sure you
haven't forgotten...

00:19:48.275 --> 00:19:50.346
It was bestowing the
power of my Sovereign Eye

00:19:50.379 --> 00:19:52.483
to that pathetic little
Drumbler of mine...

00:19:52.517 --> 00:19:57.695
that allowed him to
evolve into the beast Goroa!

00:19:57.728 --> 00:19:58.763
I knew if need be,

00:19:58.796 --> 00:20:01.468
I could evolve my body
in the same manner.

00:20:01.502 --> 00:20:04.440
Which is what
stands before you!

00:20:10.286 --> 00:20:11.689
I also knew that if I,

00:20:11.722 --> 00:20:14.394
the source of the Magic Power
driving the transformation,

00:20:14.427 --> 00:20:18.469
attempted it myself,
I couldn't change back.

00:20:18.503 --> 00:20:21.676
Sovereign Rock Castle was a
plaything for conquering worlds;

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:24.280
a crude sketch of
my impossible dream!

00:20:24.313 --> 00:20:26.586
But I'd gladly take
this state over defeat.

00:20:26.619 --> 00:20:28.288
Anything is better
than failure.

00:20:28.322 --> 00:20:29.725
Crude though it is,

00:20:29.758 --> 00:20:33.265
the name of legendary Dark King
Vearn will go on in infamy!

00:20:33.299 --> 00:20:34.702
That's your reason?

00:20:34.735 --> 00:20:36.773
You're using a power
you decided to lock away

00:20:36.806 --> 00:20:39.978
because it was too dangerous -
just for victory?

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:45.657
Dai: You're actually choosing
to cast aside who you were...

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.630
All just to...
save your reputation?

00:20:48.663 --> 00:20:50.499
[evil cackle]

00:20:50.533 --> 00:20:52.871
So be it!
There are far worse fates!

00:20:52.905 --> 00:20:55.644
[roaring]

00:20:55.677 --> 00:20:59.350
To rule the Trio of Worlds as
a heartless beast of terror

00:20:59.384 --> 00:21:02.323
is but a small sacrifice!

00:21:03.391 --> 00:21:05.631
True Vearn: All I care
about now is besting you!

00:21:05.664 --> 00:21:09.103
To vanquish the Dragon Knight -
I'll accept any form I must.

00:21:09.136 --> 00:21:10.439
Defeating you...

00:21:10.473 --> 00:21:13.546
is worth any price!

00:21:19.925 --> 00:21:25.369
It's time I rid myself
of you, Dai. Begone!

00:21:25.402 --> 00:21:27.339
[agonized cry]

00:21:32.551 --> 00:21:36.959
Full power... Draconic Aura!

00:21:46.679 --> 00:21:48.950
Doruora!

00:21:52.757 --> 00:21:55.395
[horrified howl]

00:23:35.931 --> 00:23:38.570
Narrator: To match the Dragonoid
Dai's relentless attacks,

00:23:38.603 --> 00:23:41.576
the Dark King has taken the
form of the Sovereign Supreme.

00:23:41.609 --> 00:23:44.047
The supercharged rivals will
summon the last of their might,

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.484
squaring off in a
heart-stopping clash.

00:23:46.518 --> 00:23:48.321
Armed with his father's
Demon Dragon Blade,

00:23:48.355 --> 00:23:52.030
Dai fights to ensure that his
sacrifice won't be in vain...

00:23:52.063 --> 00:23:53.098
The battle between the Hero

00:23:53.131 --> 00:23:55.503
and the Dark King will
finally come to a close -
