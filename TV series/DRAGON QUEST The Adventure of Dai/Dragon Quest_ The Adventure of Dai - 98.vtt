WEBVTT

00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:47.014
[terrified screams]

00:01:47.047 --> 00:01:49.118
Oh, c'mon.
Are you k-kidding me?

00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:51.455
Deroline: W-Why is
there a monster here?!

00:01:52.458 --> 00:01:54.162
What are you, an amateur?

00:01:54.195 --> 00:01:55.731
The Dark King sent me.

00:01:55.765 --> 00:01:59.773
I'm here to keep you humans
from freezing it. So...

00:01:59.806 --> 00:02:02.144
[screeching]

00:02:04.382 --> 00:02:06.653
I wouldn't be so
sure about that.

00:02:09.793 --> 00:02:12.699
Matoriv: No time for
the whole song and dance...

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:16.272
Here's the short version:
get lost, buddy.

00:02:16.974 --> 00:02:20.548
[shrieking]

00:02:28.798 --> 00:02:30.133
Brother?

00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:32.973
Hey. Well, that's a surprise.

00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:34.576
You're still alive after all.

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:36.479
Haven't seen you
since you ran away from

00:02:36.513 --> 00:02:39.586
our old master with
your tail between your legs.

00:02:42.491 --> 00:02:44.261
[wheezing]

00:02:44.294 --> 00:02:45.664
You all right?

00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:54.749
We're too late!
It's gonna blow!

00:03:02.431 --> 00:03:05.303
Masopho... You're going
to have to do this.

00:03:08.076 --> 00:03:10.447
Came here to save
the world, didn't you?

00:03:11.717 --> 00:03:15.691
But... my magic is
nothing next to yours.

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.334
Matoriv: There's no
running away this time.

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:24.576
Once the world disappears,
there'll be nowhere to go.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.081
If you want to call
yourself a man...

00:03:27.114 --> 00:03:29.886
then for once in
your life, Masopho...

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:33.794
try being a true hero. For me.

00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:45.851
What are you waiting
for, you old coot?!

00:03:45.885 --> 00:03:47.589
This is our chance!

00:03:47.622 --> 00:03:49.125
Deroline: The world's
counting on us.

00:03:49.158 --> 00:03:51.162
We'll give you a hand.
Cast the spell!

00:03:51.196 --> 00:03:52.999
I'm not nearly rich
enough to go yet -

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:54.536
so make it snappy!

00:04:20.755 --> 00:04:22.626
Of all the things
you could wish for,

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:24.762
this is the "miracle"
you waste it on?

00:04:24.796 --> 00:04:26.867
The Tear of the Gods
may have united

00:04:26.901 --> 00:04:28.169
the world for you...

00:04:28.203 --> 00:04:30.774
but it's meaningless now!

00:04:32.745 --> 00:04:34.148
True Vearn:
You're out of time.

00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:37.054
United or not,
the Cores will detonate!

00:04:37.087 --> 00:04:38.958
Here we go!

00:04:38.991 --> 00:04:40.493
This is it!

00:04:40.528 --> 00:04:42.665
All: All together...

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:53.085
Please work!

00:04:55.791 --> 00:05:04.308
[battle cries]

00:05:25.952 --> 00:05:28.089
True Vearn: Nothing...

00:05:28.123 --> 00:05:31.028
What happened?!
What have you done?!

00:05:37.341 --> 00:05:39.344
Masopho: It stopped.
We did it!

00:05:40.414 --> 00:05:42.585
D-Did you see that?!

00:05:46.225 --> 00:05:47.194
Both: We did it!

00:05:47.227 --> 00:05:49.465
[relieved tears]

00:05:49.498 --> 00:05:50.734
Heroh Heroh: Lemme in!

00:05:50.768 --> 00:06:00.119
[cheering]

00:06:20.027 --> 00:06:21.295
My word...

00:06:21.328 --> 00:06:22.999
Extraordinary!

00:06:23.032 --> 00:06:25.069
They've really done it!

00:06:25.772 --> 00:06:27.642
The sky...

00:06:27.675 --> 00:06:30.848
It's shining like pure gold!

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.297
Leona: Do you... Do you
think it could be...

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.067
Popp: It's him.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.238
It's Gomechan...

00:06:59.272 --> 00:07:01.142
It must be how the
little guy's saying

00:07:01.175 --> 00:07:02.778
goodbye to everybody.

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:07.454
Bye, Gomechan...

00:07:07.488 --> 00:07:10.527
Popp [thought]: I... I don't
want to say it, but...

00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:15.805
So long, my friend.

00:07:15.838 --> 00:07:18.075
It won't be the
same without you.

00:07:22.184 --> 00:07:23.453
[sobbing]

00:07:23.486 --> 00:07:25.224
Maam [thought]: I wish
I could be there...

00:07:25.257 --> 00:07:27.094
to hold you one more time...

00:07:27.127 --> 00:07:30.400
Even if it's only...
until you disappear...

00:07:30.433 --> 00:07:31.670
At least that way,

00:07:31.703 --> 00:07:34.709
I could tell you how much
I'm going to miss you.

00:07:43.059 --> 00:07:44.261
Dai [thought]: Gomechan...

00:07:44.295 --> 00:07:45.631
This isn't goodbye, okay?

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:47.568
When you come back
from the heavens and

00:07:47.601 --> 00:07:49.405
become the Tear of
the Gods again,

00:07:49.438 --> 00:07:51.276
even if you don't
remember me,

00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:53.245
I'll never forget you...

00:07:54.148 --> 00:07:55.150
I promise...

00:07:55.183 --> 00:08:00.226
Wherever you reincarnate,
I'll find you again.

00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:01.629
And when I do...

00:08:01.663 --> 00:08:06.472
I swear I'll make the same
wish I did when I was little.

00:08:06.506 --> 00:08:08.844
I'll wish for you
to be my friend...

00:08:08.877 --> 00:08:11.449
For you to get your
memories back, too!

00:08:11.482 --> 00:08:12.552
Then we can...

00:08:12.586 --> 00:08:15.290
We can pick up right
where we left off.

00:08:15.323 --> 00:08:18.196
This is goodbye...
But just for now!

00:08:18.229 --> 00:08:21.870
[joyous chirp]

00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:46.452
There you go, Vearn.

00:08:46.485 --> 00:08:49.324
It's all over. You're beaten.

00:08:49.357 --> 00:08:50.828
Dai: You told us
the destruction of

00:08:50.861 --> 00:08:52.666
the Surface World
was inevitable,

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:54.334
but the world's still here.

00:08:54.368 --> 00:08:55.804
We proved you wrong.

00:09:00.413 --> 00:09:01.716
Those human bonds
you laughed at?

00:09:01.749 --> 00:09:03.386
In the end,
they wound up being

00:09:03.419 --> 00:09:05.758
the key to a great miracle.

00:09:05.792 --> 00:09:08.597
Even you can see that now.

00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:11.904
Dai: Accept it, you're done.

00:09:11.937 --> 00:09:13.439
No matter what you try next,

00:09:13.472 --> 00:09:15.744
you won't destroy
the Surface World!

00:09:23.126 --> 00:09:26.198
H-Hey! What's wrong,
Mister Dark King?!

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:27.468
Popp: Cat got your tongue?

00:09:27.502 --> 00:09:29.639
What? Are you a sore loser?

00:09:31.175 --> 00:09:34.414
True Vearn: Of course
not. I do apologize.

00:09:34.448 --> 00:09:37.220
I was merely taking
a moment to think.

00:09:38.623 --> 00:09:42.999
Very well, then. I suppose
there's no denying it.

00:09:43.033 --> 00:09:46.138
The power of human
bonds has beaten me.

00:09:46.774 --> 00:09:49.277
What a terrifying marvel.

00:09:49.311 --> 00:09:52.952
It's hard to believe,
but I accept it. I've lost.

00:09:53.887 --> 00:09:55.624
True Vearn: Though
I must also say,

00:09:55.658 --> 00:09:58.229
you've left me
rather confused.

00:09:59.231 --> 00:10:00.802
How could it be that...

00:10:00.835 --> 00:10:04.374
you can possess such
incredible power...

00:10:04.408 --> 00:10:08.551
and only think to use it for
such frivolous purposes?

00:10:08.584 --> 00:10:10.621
Perhaps...
the reason you waste

00:10:10.654 --> 00:10:13.561
such a gift on
pointless things is...

00:10:13.594 --> 00:10:16.465
the gift terrifies
you as well.

00:10:16.499 --> 00:10:19.706
You know the mind of mortals
better than anyone, Popp...

00:10:19.739 --> 00:10:21.810
What do you think?

00:10:21.843 --> 00:10:23.380
Please, enlighten me.

00:10:23.413 --> 00:10:25.484
I simply must know...

00:10:25.518 --> 00:10:27.688
Before I abandon hope...

00:10:28.723 --> 00:10:31.630
and slaughter
the three of you.

00:10:31.663 --> 00:10:33.132
True Vearn: I'll
rid myself of you

00:10:33.166 --> 00:10:35.905
infuriating children
here and now...

00:10:35.938 --> 00:10:38.042
Before you can strike again.

00:10:38.075 --> 00:10:39.746
Then, I'll simply
carry on and

00:10:39.779 --> 00:10:42.350
detonate the Core below us.

00:10:42.384 --> 00:10:43.721
Even if that fails,

00:10:43.754 --> 00:10:47.161
and I have to start from
scratch, human lives are short.

00:10:47.194 --> 00:10:50.199
I, on the other hand,
can live forever.

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:52.270
True Vearn: You wished
for the wrong miracle.

00:10:52.303 --> 00:10:55.677
You risked your lives...
to make this one happen...

00:10:56.746 --> 00:10:57.982
But ultimately,

00:10:58.015 --> 00:11:00.888
you've won nothing more
than a small amount time.

00:11:01.723 --> 00:11:03.828
So long as I
have eternal life,

00:11:03.861 --> 00:11:05.396
however you try to foil me,

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.670
your efforts are little
more than self-preservation.

00:11:08.704 --> 00:11:11.843
That's what I simply
don't understand.

00:11:13.614 --> 00:11:15.884
I can't see why humans
even want to go on

00:11:15.918 --> 00:11:17.688
with their pointless
achievements.

00:11:17.722 --> 00:11:20.092
In the end, they'll
all be forgotten.

00:11:24.669 --> 00:11:27.407
True Vearn: Welcome...
To your annihilation!

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.313
The bloodline of the Dragon
Knights will be cut short,

00:11:30.346 --> 00:11:33.787
and the mightiest warriors of
the Surface World will fall!

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.758
Your end is nigh.

00:11:35.791 --> 00:11:38.597
Soon after, the decimation
of the surface world

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.567
will begin again, with vigor.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.769
And this time,

00:11:41.803 --> 00:11:44.074
there won't be anyone
left to stand in my way.

00:11:44.107 --> 00:11:51.355
[evil laughter]

00:11:51.388 --> 00:11:54.095
True Vearn: I can see you're
finally beginning to realize...

00:11:54.128 --> 00:11:56.332
just how different
the scale I'm working on

00:11:56.365 --> 00:11:58.002
is compared to yours.

00:11:58.035 --> 00:12:00.273
You've proven humans
are impressive creatures,

00:12:00.306 --> 00:12:03.780
wielding unimaginable
perseverance.

00:12:03.814 --> 00:12:05.717
For what it's worth,
you weren't wrong.

00:12:05.751 --> 00:12:07.889
Your final moments
have been beautiful.

00:12:07.922 --> 00:12:10.259
Like a brilliant flash!

00:12:11.262 --> 00:12:15.203
No... We actually pulled
off a miracle here...

00:12:15.236 --> 00:12:18.677
And after all that,
he still gets to win?

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:21.349
There's no way this
can be how it ends.

00:12:21.382 --> 00:12:23.152
No way!

00:12:24.555 --> 00:12:26.458
Dai [thought]: We can't
let this happen.

00:12:26.492 --> 00:12:27.996
Whatever it takes...

00:12:28.029 --> 00:12:31.235
Gomechan's sacrifice,
his final gift...

00:12:31.268 --> 00:12:33.607
We can't let it all
have been for nothing!

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.143
I'm not just
gonna stand here.

00:12:35.176 --> 00:12:38.584
There's gotta be a way.
Think, Dai. Think!

00:12:38.617 --> 00:12:39.919
Even if it's a long shot...

00:12:39.952 --> 00:12:42.659
If there's a chance of
saving everybody's future,

00:12:42.692 --> 00:12:44.427
I can't let them down.

00:12:50.908 --> 00:12:52.879
Dai [thought]:
There is one way...

00:12:52.912 --> 00:12:54.916
Well... maybe we
can't beat him twice,

00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:56.519
but that doesn't
mean we can't keep

00:12:56.553 --> 00:12:57.822
being a pain in his neck.

00:12:57.855 --> 00:12:58.957
You with me, Princess?

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:00.527
Oh, I'm with you.

00:13:02.932 --> 00:13:06.338
You truly can't help
yourself, can you?

00:13:06.372 --> 00:13:07.842
Dai: Leona, Popp...

00:13:07.875 --> 00:13:09.779
Gather all the jewels - now.

00:13:09.812 --> 00:13:10.747
-Leona: Huh?
-Popp: What?

00:13:10.781 --> 00:13:11.683
Wait, why?

00:13:11.717 --> 00:13:13.419
Just do it! Please, hurry!

00:13:14.254 --> 00:13:15.924
All right. On it.

00:13:17.728 --> 00:13:18.697
Popp: Okay...

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.499
That's all eight,
like you asked.

00:13:22.739 --> 00:13:24.708
So, uh... What now?

00:13:24.742 --> 00:13:26.412
Hold onto them
and keep them safe.

00:13:26.445 --> 00:13:28.148
Find someplace to take cover.

00:13:28.784 --> 00:13:30.086
Take cover?

00:13:30.119 --> 00:13:33.292
Dai: I might not be able
to control what happens next.

00:13:34.862 --> 00:13:36.934
Dai: There's one
last thing I want to try.

00:13:36.967 --> 00:13:38.970
Something truly terrible...

00:13:39.003 --> 00:13:41.442
Something Vearn doesn't
have any hope of beating.

00:13:41.475 --> 00:13:44.949
But it scares me. That's why
I've never used it before.

00:13:44.983 --> 00:13:47.120
When I do, I don't
know what'll happen,

00:13:47.154 --> 00:13:49.391
and I'm not sure I'll
be able to stop it...

00:13:49.424 --> 00:13:52.832
so first I need to
know everybody's safe.

00:13:52.865 --> 00:13:53.767
And that means...

00:13:53.801 --> 00:13:55.337
You'd better get
as far away from

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:56.840
Vearn Palace as you can.

00:13:56.873 --> 00:13:58.376
What are you talking about?

00:13:58.409 --> 00:13:59.411
We're trapped in here.

00:13:59.444 --> 00:14:01.949
As long as Vearn's standing,
the field is, too.

00:14:01.983 --> 00:14:03.319
Dai: Don't worry
about the field.

00:14:03.352 --> 00:14:05.223
If I wind up being
right about this,

00:14:05.256 --> 00:14:08.495
by the time you get outside,
it'll be long gone.

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:13.540
Dai: Because Vearn...
won't be standing.

00:14:15.811 --> 00:14:17.982
True Vearn: Spare me
your hollow threats.

00:14:18.015 --> 00:14:20.386
No matter what arrangement
you three attack me in,

00:14:20.419 --> 00:14:24.094
I won't be taken down.
You can't win.

00:14:24.128 --> 00:14:26.164
Not the three of us.

00:14:30.106 --> 00:14:33.278
Dai: With this, I can
bring you down alone!

00:14:33.312 --> 00:14:36.018
Two Dragon Crests...
are you sure?

00:14:36.051 --> 00:14:39.024
Do you really insist
on fighting by yourself?

00:14:39.057 --> 00:14:40.828
All the better
for me, I suppose.

00:14:40.861 --> 00:14:43.499
That makes my victory
even more certain.

00:14:43.533 --> 00:14:45.537
Dai: No, there's still a way.

00:14:46.572 --> 00:14:48.442
My last resort.

00:14:48.476 --> 00:14:50.781
See... I haven't unleashed
the full power of

00:14:50.814 --> 00:14:52.951
my Twin Dragon Crests.

00:14:53.854 --> 00:14:56.526
True Vearn: [laughing]

00:14:56.559 --> 00:14:57.728
Surely you're joking.

00:14:57.762 --> 00:14:59.064
Do you actually
mean to say...

00:14:59.097 --> 00:15:01.703
that you haven't been
fighting at full strength?

00:15:01.737 --> 00:15:04.976
[delighted laughter]

00:15:05.009 --> 00:15:07.413
Not quite - I fought
with everything I had.

00:15:07.447 --> 00:15:09.819
At least... as much
as I can without

00:15:09.852 --> 00:15:12.123
turning into something
else entirely.

00:15:13.158 --> 00:15:14.862
But as you know,
a Dragon Knight...

00:15:14.895 --> 00:15:17.902
can take it one step further.

00:15:17.935 --> 00:15:19.805
True Vearn [thought]:
The Dragonoid.

00:15:19.839 --> 00:15:22.076
Dai: I can... I can tell.

00:15:22.109 --> 00:15:25.083
I started feeling it while
you and I were fighting.

00:15:25.116 --> 00:15:27.588
I figure if I'm using
my Crest at ten...

00:15:27.622 --> 00:15:28.923
then the Crest Dad gave me

00:15:28.957 --> 00:15:31.930
is likely only working
at maybe three or four.

00:15:31.963 --> 00:15:35.035
I'm not really sure why
it didn't go any further.

00:15:38.075 --> 00:15:39.377
Dai: I'm guessing
my body's been

00:15:39.411 --> 00:15:41.583
restricting the
energy it's using...

00:15:41.616 --> 00:15:43.385
Survival instincts kicked in.

00:15:43.419 --> 00:15:45.390
Either way, it's
maintaining a level

00:15:45.423 --> 00:15:48.630
that I can wield
without losing myself.

00:15:48.663 --> 00:15:50.032
But if I push through that,

00:15:50.066 --> 00:15:53.640
and willingly unleash
both Crests at full power...

00:15:53.673 --> 00:15:55.310
I might not
come back from it,

00:15:55.343 --> 00:15:58.950
but my strength
should be unstoppable.

00:15:58.983 --> 00:16:00.888
Dai: I will become
the Dragonoid.

00:16:00.921 --> 00:16:02.023
No, don't do it!

00:16:02.056 --> 00:16:03.292
You can't, Dai.

00:16:03.325 --> 00:16:04.996
Not if it... Not if it means

00:16:05.029 --> 00:16:06.398
you won't be yourself anymore.

00:16:06.431 --> 00:16:08.402
Haven't we already
lost enough?

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.479
Dai: I know. It's not
what I wanted either.

00:16:13.513 --> 00:16:14.480
I'm scared.

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:18.289
I've got no idea what
form I'm about to take...

00:16:18.322 --> 00:16:19.926
And there's no
way of knowing...

00:16:19.959 --> 00:16:22.531
if I can change back
after defeating Vearn...

00:16:22.564 --> 00:16:24.000
the way Dad could.

00:16:24.935 --> 00:16:27.541
What I wanted was for
us to win together.

00:16:27.575 --> 00:16:28.977
Since I was little,

00:16:29.011 --> 00:16:30.747
I wished that I
would become a Hero,

00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:33.686
fighting for peace and
protecting the human world.

00:16:34.955 --> 00:16:36.324
Not to become...

00:16:36.358 --> 00:16:39.632
something that
isn't who I am.

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:42.905
I don't want to let
myself become a monster.

00:16:42.938 --> 00:16:45.544
But... But...

00:16:45.577 --> 00:16:49.284
To let the future of the whole
world be crushed instead...

00:16:49.318 --> 00:16:51.522
That... That's even worse!

00:17:06.084 --> 00:17:08.188
Popp, I have to...

00:17:08.957 --> 00:17:12.230
Y-You... You're an idiot.

00:17:12.263 --> 00:17:14.802
Even now. After getting
all the way here.

00:17:16.673 --> 00:17:18.142
You're going to...

00:17:18.175 --> 00:17:21.214
You're going to protect
us and the world.

00:17:21.248 --> 00:17:24.220
Even if it costs...
e-everything?

00:17:24.254 --> 00:17:25.422
You're willing to...

00:17:25.456 --> 00:17:27.828
to cast aside your own
future to pull it off?

00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:32.104
Promise me something, okay?

00:17:32.137 --> 00:17:34.575
No matter what I become,
don't be shocked.

00:17:35.176 --> 00:17:36.712
Popp: As if!

00:17:38.149 --> 00:17:40.019
Popp: I'd see you
through to the end,

00:17:40.052 --> 00:17:42.824
even if you turned out
uglier than Zaboera.

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:48.168
I promise.

00:17:48.202 --> 00:17:50.105
Besides, no matter
what you look like,

00:17:50.139 --> 00:17:51.977
you'll always be you, pal.

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.111
Leona: Yes.

00:17:53.145 --> 00:17:55.316
You'll always be our Dai.

00:17:59.091 --> 00:18:00.694
Thank you.

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:15.289
Both: [screaming]

00:18:15.824 --> 00:18:17.594
Dai: Popp! Leona!

00:18:19.064 --> 00:18:20.200
True Vearn: [laughing]

00:18:20.233 --> 00:18:22.170
Why, isn't that a pity.

00:18:22.203 --> 00:18:24.207
They'll have to miss
your last brave stand.

00:18:24.241 --> 00:18:26.311
I'm sure they
wanted to see it...

00:18:26.345 --> 00:18:29.585
But from the depths of
the palace, they won't hear.

00:18:30.052 --> 00:18:32.658
[mocking laughter]

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.229
Oh, are you angry?

00:18:35.262 --> 00:18:37.299
Unleash your fury.

00:18:37.333 --> 00:18:40.173
If you truly possess this
power you've been boasting of -

00:18:40.206 --> 00:18:41.809
go ahead and punish me.

00:18:41.843 --> 00:18:46.318
[cackling]

00:18:46.352 --> 00:18:47.854
Dai: In that case...

00:18:50.126 --> 00:18:52.430
I hope you're truly ready.

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:08.730
Dai: First, I'll move my
Crest back to my forehead.

00:19:08.764 --> 00:19:12.270
And then... I'll move
Dad's Crest there, too.

00:19:12.303 --> 00:19:16.277
Soon... They'll
become one within me!

00:19:30.607 --> 00:19:35.349
[mighty roar]

00:19:43.165 --> 00:19:45.336
W-What a f-fearsome Aura...

00:19:45.369 --> 00:19:47.641
You're a monster!

00:19:47.675 --> 00:19:48.976
Dai: Yeah.

00:19:50.012 --> 00:19:52.952
We're both monsters, Vearn...

00:19:52.985 --> 00:19:55.590
Only... I'm worse than you.

00:20:01.334 --> 00:20:04.207
I'll slash you to ribbons,
you mindless creature!

00:20:07.079 --> 00:20:09.317
Calamitous...

00:20:10.587 --> 00:20:12.858
End!

00:20:30.125 --> 00:20:31.695
[pained groan]

00:20:35.402 --> 00:20:37.974
[furious howl]

00:20:43.151 --> 00:20:47.727
[terrifying howl]

00:20:49.698 --> 00:20:51.001
True Vearn [thought]:
This isn't...

00:20:51.034 --> 00:20:52.771
This isn't coming
from Dai at all.

00:20:52.804 --> 00:20:57.814
Those beast-like eyes are
his father's. It's Baran!

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:01.388
Dai: Power is justice, right?

00:21:01.421 --> 00:21:04.528
You've been telling me that
ever since the beginning.

00:21:05.196 --> 00:21:06.665
[roaring]

00:21:21.462 --> 00:21:22.898
Dai: So does this...

00:21:22.931 --> 00:21:25.603
Does this feel... like
justice to you, Dark King?

00:21:25.637 --> 00:21:28.910
Because it doesn't to me!

00:21:28.943 --> 00:21:30.079
Dai: Haven't you learned yet

00:21:30.112 --> 00:21:32.182
that there's always someone
out there who's stronger -

00:21:32.216 --> 00:21:34.721
with a power greater
than your own?!

00:21:36.358 --> 00:21:38.194
Dai: This is
just getting even.

00:21:38.228 --> 00:21:39.932
You've got every
bit of it coming...

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:42.169
But there's no way...
This isn't justice.

00:21:42.203 --> 00:21:44.373
It can't be justice!

00:21:52.925 --> 00:21:55.295
True Vearn [thought]: There's
no question about those eyes.

00:21:55.329 --> 00:21:57.299
They're filled with
what Dai lacked,

00:21:57.333 --> 00:21:59.437
but Baran had in spades...

00:21:59.471 --> 00:22:01.308
That thirst for vengeance.

00:22:01.341 --> 00:22:02.978
That bloodlust!

00:22:03.411 --> 00:22:04.615
Nevertheless...

00:22:04.648 --> 00:22:08.455
I won't lose again! Failure
cannot be allowed!

00:22:08.488 --> 00:22:11.295
True Vearn: I am the
mighty Dark King Vearn!

00:22:11.328 --> 00:22:13.098
Now perish!

00:22:13.132 --> 00:22:15.603
[roaring]

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.330
Narrator: With his
Twin Dragon Crests alight,

00:23:52.363 --> 00:23:54.367
Dai launches a ruthless
assault on Vearn,

00:23:54.401 --> 00:23:56.739
unleashing the full fury
of his Dragonoid form...

00:23:56.772 --> 00:23:59.411
But the Dark King has one
last surprise of his own.

00:23:59.444 --> 00:24:00.479
Next time on

00:24:00.513 --> 00:24:02.149
Dragon Quest;
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:02.183 --> 00:24:04.120
"Victory by These Hands".
