WEBVTT

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.163
Hyunckel: It's over.

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.406
[weeping]

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.879
All right, then. Go ahead.
Do whatever you will with us.

00:02:02.912 --> 00:02:05.585
I find it hard to believe
that you've all given up.

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.856
Crocodine: It wouldn't
make a difference now.

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:09.392
Popp is dead, and he's taken

00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:12.164
our only hope of
defeating you with him.

00:02:12.197 --> 00:02:13.768
There's nothing
left for us to do.

00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:15.538
Mystvearn: If I had
known just how central

00:02:15.572 --> 00:02:18.042
that boy was to your
party's success,

00:02:18.076 --> 00:02:20.113
I would've done away
with him sooner.

00:02:20.147 --> 00:02:22.150
In hindsight,
I should've seen it.

00:02:22.184 --> 00:02:23.987
Even Kill held
him in high regard.

00:02:24.021 --> 00:02:26.326
Mystvearn: He said such people
have a knack for becoming

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:28.263
the heart and
soul of their team...

00:02:28.296 --> 00:02:31.269
so it's wise pick them
off as early as possible.

00:02:31.303 --> 00:02:32.405
His valiant efforts

00:02:32.438 --> 00:02:34.576
have proven he was
worthy of such respect.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.413
It's been many years
since an opponent

00:02:36.446 --> 00:02:38.851
forced me to make
use of the Phoenix Wing.

00:02:40.221 --> 00:02:41.657
Hyunckel [thought]:
The Phoenix Wing?

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.293
Why is that familiar...

00:02:43.327 --> 00:02:45.397
Mystvearn: It's a high
velocity palm strike...

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:48.102
One that's able to
deflect any kind of spell.

00:02:48.136 --> 00:02:50.040
The power of Medroa
may be unmatched,

00:02:50.073 --> 00:02:51.643
but it's still no exception.

00:02:51.677 --> 00:02:54.248
If it's any consolation,
I doubt I could've survived

00:02:54.281 --> 00:02:57.723
that attack if I hadn't
used this forbidden skill.

00:02:57.756 --> 00:02:58.824
Hyunckel: The Phoenix...

00:02:58.858 --> 00:03:00.093
The immortal bird...

00:03:00.126 --> 00:03:01.964
That means...

00:03:01.997 --> 00:03:04.602
Vearn: Kaiser Phoenix.

00:03:07.107 --> 00:03:10.013
Hyunckel [thought]: That's it!
They share the phoenix...

00:03:10.047 --> 00:03:12.084
Somehow, Mystvearn
and Vearn must be...

00:03:12.117 --> 00:03:13.688
Yes, they have to be!

00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:16.159
I think I know Mystvearn's
true identity...

00:03:16.192 --> 00:03:17.361
And if I'm right,

00:03:17.395 --> 00:03:20.033
it makes perfect sense
why he's so powerful...

00:03:20.067 --> 00:03:22.337
I've sensed it
all this time...

00:03:22.371 --> 00:03:24.342
Don't insult me
with mercy here.

00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:25.912
Hurry up and finish it.

00:03:25.945 --> 00:03:27.347
But remember this, you fool:

00:03:27.381 --> 00:03:29.051
no matter what
you do with us,

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:30.921
Dai will make
quick work of you.

00:03:31.857 --> 00:03:33.025
You make a good point.

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:36.600
The all-important little Hero
still remains, doesn't he?

00:03:36.634 --> 00:03:38.938
In that case, I shall
give you as you wish.

00:03:38.971 --> 00:03:40.440
Know that it
won't be long before

00:03:40.474 --> 00:03:42.713
Dai joins you in
the afterlife.

00:03:42.746 --> 00:03:43.881
No way.

00:03:43.914 --> 00:03:45.383
Your certainty is admirable,

00:03:45.416 --> 00:03:47.220
but it doesn't
change the truth:

00:03:47.254 --> 00:03:49.191
No matter how
powerful Dai grows,

00:03:49.225 --> 00:03:51.630
he can never stop
the Dark King Vearn.

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:53.934
Dai hasn't had
the chance, has he?

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.138
After all, how could he...

00:03:56.172 --> 00:03:58.745
when he's attacking
the wrong target?

00:03:58.778 --> 00:04:01.784
Because the real
King Vearn isn't there...

00:04:01.817 --> 00:04:02.819
He's right here.

00:04:02.852 --> 00:04:05.992
He's been right before
our eyes, all along.

00:04:06.026 --> 00:04:06.994
Huh?

00:04:07.027 --> 00:04:10.267
So? Is that "the truth"?

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.872
Are you and the Dark
King one and the same?!

00:04:15.143 --> 00:04:16.012
[gasp]

00:04:16.045 --> 00:04:17.281
Wh-What?

00:04:17.314 --> 00:04:18.784
C'mon, what kind of stupid
sense does that make?

00:04:18.817 --> 00:04:21.188
It would have to be an
illusion. Think about it.

00:04:21.222 --> 00:04:23.092
You've all seen Mystvearn
in the same place

00:04:23.125 --> 00:04:25.798
as the Dark King
numerous times...

00:04:27.868 --> 00:04:30.808
I always knew you'd be the
first to realize the truth.

00:04:30.842 --> 00:04:33.747
Your perceptions are as
clear as ever, Hyunckel.

00:04:36.085 --> 00:04:37.421
From the moment
Mystvearn revealed

00:04:37.454 --> 00:04:39.693
the face he's been hiding
under the Shadow Raiment,

00:04:39.726 --> 00:04:41.495
I've sensed a presence
that I recognized

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.399
but couldn't quite place.

00:04:43.433 --> 00:04:44.670
When I saw the phoenix...

00:04:44.703 --> 00:04:47.207
I knew it could be
none other than Vearn.

00:04:47.241 --> 00:04:48.944
Now, it's almost obvious.

00:04:48.978 --> 00:04:50.515
While his voice
may be youthful,

00:04:50.548 --> 00:04:52.484
Mystvearn's mannerisms
and fighting style

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:54.956
all line up with
the Dark King's.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.696
I suspect that the reason
Mystvearn was forced to conceal

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.367
his appearance and keep
silent for all these years...

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.070
is because if someone
familiar with Vearn

00:05:02.104 --> 00:05:04.709
had heard his voice or seen
how he carried himself,

00:05:04.742 --> 00:05:07.180
they might begin to notice
all the subtle similarities.

00:05:07.214 --> 00:05:09.920
Hyunckel: And since a kingdom
can't be ruled in silence,

00:05:09.953 --> 00:05:11.756
the shadow made a sacrifice.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.696
But that shadow was pulling
the strings all along.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.933
Mystvearn: Close... But
don't bother with the rest.

00:05:16.967 --> 00:05:21.309
You were mostly correct -
still, it makes no difference.

00:05:21.342 --> 00:05:23.514
You've gleaned far more
than you deserve to know.

00:05:23.547 --> 00:05:25.919
Now, take it with you.

00:05:25.952 --> 00:05:26.820
Killvearn: Oh, come on.

00:05:26.854 --> 00:05:28.657
What's the harm in
a few more moments?

00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:32.063
You've already said this much -
why not tell us the rest?

00:05:34.235 --> 00:05:35.303
Well, look who it is.

00:05:35.337 --> 00:05:37.307
Killvearn: In the
flesh, as they say.

00:05:37.341 --> 00:05:39.211
But I'd like to
hear more about you.

00:05:39.244 --> 00:05:40.346
So, you've won.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.652
Or did Avan find
a way to escape?

00:05:43.754 --> 00:05:45.758
Killvearn: What do you think?

00:05:46.927 --> 00:05:48.363
No. No, he can't be...

00:05:48.396 --> 00:05:49.533
Killvearn: If you need proof,

00:05:49.566 --> 00:05:51.871
you can find a part
of him over that way.

00:05:51.904 --> 00:05:53.073
N-No, he...

00:05:53.106 --> 00:05:54.441
He can't...

00:05:54.475 --> 00:05:55.811
N-Not again, please!

00:05:55.844 --> 00:05:56.613
Chiu: M-Maam...

00:05:56.646 --> 00:05:58.282
Mystvearn: Tragedy
upon tragedy.

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:00.988
That's the price
fools pay, isn't it?

00:06:01.022 --> 00:06:01.823
Anyway...

00:06:01.857 --> 00:06:03.627
You've tickled
my curiosity, Kill.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.831
What exactly did
you mean by that?

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:09.138
Killvearn: Mean by what?

00:06:09.171 --> 00:06:10.675
The hand's all
that's left of him...

00:06:10.708 --> 00:06:12.845
Don't be ridiculous.
Why do you insist on asking

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:16.520
over and over about
my true identity?

00:06:16.553 --> 00:06:18.056
Over these centuries,
you've seen me fight

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:20.928
with my face revealed like
this at least a few times...

00:06:20.961 --> 00:06:21.997
All those years,

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.368
and yet it's always
the same question with you.

00:06:24.401 --> 00:06:27.074
I see you've forgotten
my answer yet again.

00:06:27.107 --> 00:06:28.844
"Don't bother asking."

00:06:28.877 --> 00:06:31.415
"Even the likes of the
Reaper would not be spared

00:06:31.448 --> 00:06:33.554
if he came to know the
true meaning of this face

00:06:33.587 --> 00:06:35.323
which I am burdened to hide."

00:06:35.357 --> 00:06:39.198
Mystvearn: I'm duty-bound, and
it's not my role to explain it.

00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:40.535
It seemed to me as if

00:06:40.568 --> 00:06:42.639
you understood my
secret perfectly well.

00:06:42.672 --> 00:06:44.575
It's why the last
time I tried to

00:06:44.609 --> 00:06:46.479
reveal this face
without permission,

00:06:46.514 --> 00:06:48.149
you threatened to kill me.

00:06:48.182 --> 00:06:49.652
So why the change in attitude?

00:06:49.686 --> 00:06:51.556
Killvearn: I follow my
whims where I please...

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.861
And don't you go
forgetting, either.

00:06:53.895 --> 00:06:55.598
Killvearn: I may be
obliged to assist

00:06:55.631 --> 00:06:57.034
in the Dark King's endeavors,

00:06:57.067 --> 00:07:00.908
but unlike you, I'm not
duty-bound to his silly rules.

00:07:01.944 --> 00:07:03.547
Ah, yes. Fair enough.

00:07:03.581 --> 00:07:05.416
The Dark Army might
have its ranks,

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.989
but the Reaper stands
above them, doesn't he?

00:07:08.022 --> 00:07:11.930
In terms of stature, you're
nearly equal to Vearn himself.

00:07:12.865 --> 00:07:14.569
And I haven't
forgotten a thing.

00:07:14.603 --> 00:07:16.907
The memory of the day
you first appeared before us

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.748
is as clear in my mind as
if it happened yesterday.

00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:29.633
Killvearn: Charming palace.

00:07:29.666 --> 00:07:32.572
So which one of you...
is King Vearn?

00:07:32.605 --> 00:07:36.613
It is I. And who,
pray tell, might you be?

00:07:36.646 --> 00:07:39.519
Killvearn: My client has
advised that you can call me...

00:07:39.553 --> 00:07:41.222
Killvearn.

00:07:41.255 --> 00:07:43.594
Well, is that so?
Killvearn...

00:07:43.627 --> 00:07:46.498
Then I presume
you're... one of his?

00:07:47.969 --> 00:07:49.204
Killvearn: Indeed, sire.

00:07:49.238 --> 00:07:52.411
I come bearing glad tidings from
the ancient one you know well.

00:07:52.444 --> 00:07:53.714
A gift of sorts.

00:07:53.747 --> 00:07:55.651
My specialty
is assassination.

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:57.354
I have dressed
in my formal garb

00:07:57.387 --> 00:07:59.324
specifically to
entertain your presence.

00:07:59.357 --> 00:08:02.397
As a gesture of friendship
from our mutual ally below,

00:08:02.431 --> 00:08:03.934
I have been sent
as an aide...

00:08:03.967 --> 00:08:06.640
to ensure that your campaign
against the Surface World

00:08:06.674 --> 00:08:08.777
is a successful one.

00:08:09.646 --> 00:08:11.984
An assassin as an aide?

00:08:12.017 --> 00:08:13.386
[chuckling]

00:08:13.419 --> 00:08:15.490
What a sense of humor.

00:08:15.525 --> 00:08:17.260
Very well.
Then, I presume...

00:08:17.293 --> 00:08:20.501
that if for some reason my
campaign is unsuccessful...

00:08:20.534 --> 00:08:22.171
you'll immediately
resign as my aid,

00:08:22.204 --> 00:08:25.143
then give me a demonstration
of your specialty.

00:08:25.176 --> 00:08:30.186
A watchdog to guarantee my
conquest of the Surface...

00:08:30.219 --> 00:08:32.258
Or kill Vearn.

00:08:32.291 --> 00:08:33.827
Yes... rather quaint.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.000
A coded moniker meaning
"Eliminate Vearn"...

00:08:37.033 --> 00:08:38.570
You intrigue me.

00:08:38.604 --> 00:08:40.841
Killvearn: You are truly
the god of the Underworld...

00:08:40.874 --> 00:08:43.145
And most gracious,
Your Majesty.

00:08:44.782 --> 00:08:46.452
I see you've noticed Myst here.

00:08:46.486 --> 00:08:48.890
He's a powerful being
much like yourself...

00:08:48.924 --> 00:08:51.395
And an excellent
right-hand man.

00:08:51.428 --> 00:08:54.970
Mystvearn: I won't lie. I was
immediately taken with you.

00:08:55.003 --> 00:08:58.242
To appear before the Dark King,
yet remain so calm...

00:08:58.275 --> 00:08:59.444
Aloof, really.

00:08:59.478 --> 00:09:01.583
Your attitude left
quite an impression.

00:09:01.616 --> 00:09:04.254
Over the centuries, even
despite our differences...

00:09:04.288 --> 00:09:08.798
We got along well. We'd even
formed a sort of trust.

00:09:08.831 --> 00:09:10.233
Killvearn: That we did,

00:09:10.266 --> 00:09:13.039
except it turns out you've been
lying to me this whole time.

00:09:13.072 --> 00:09:15.878
I can understand why
you'd see it like that.

00:09:15.911 --> 00:09:17.582
After all, it's as you say:

00:09:17.615 --> 00:09:20.387
You were never truly a
servant of the Dark King.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.421
Killvearn: Indeed.

00:09:21.455 --> 00:09:22.324
Mystvearn: You were
merely following

00:09:22.358 --> 00:09:23.661
the orders of your master

00:09:23.694 --> 00:09:26.198
to do the king's bidding
while you kept an eye on him.

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:29.706
If I'm the real Vearn, it would
mean I've made a fool of you,

00:09:29.739 --> 00:09:31.577
and while you've been
assisting my decoy,

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.248
I've been free to
work from the shadows.

00:09:34.281 --> 00:09:35.049
It would also mean...

00:09:35.082 --> 00:09:36.520
that this friendship
we've shared

00:09:36.553 --> 00:09:38.891
was nothing more than
smoke and mirrors.

00:09:38.924 --> 00:09:40.795
Killvearn: Well, wasn't it?

00:09:40.828 --> 00:09:42.999
No. Because you're
wrong on both counts.

00:09:43.032 --> 00:09:44.770
We misled you
about who was who,

00:09:44.803 --> 00:09:47.174
there was no mistake
in your aid to him;

00:09:47.207 --> 00:09:48.510
nor is there any mistake in

00:09:48.543 --> 00:09:50.848
the friendship you
and I have forged.

00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:53.419
Killvearn: Well, if there's
no mistake in our friendship,

00:09:53.453 --> 00:09:54.756
then as a token of trust,

00:09:54.789 --> 00:09:56.926
why don't you just
reveal your secret...

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.195
Mystvearn?

00:10:10.287 --> 00:10:12.692
Killvearn: Temper, temper.
What was that for?

00:10:12.726 --> 00:10:15.163
Drop the act. You
are not the Reaper.

00:10:15.196 --> 00:10:17.702
I must say, you've put on
a convincing performance -

00:10:17.735 --> 00:10:19.706
But I wasn't given
my official title

00:10:19.739 --> 00:10:21.709
until well after Kill arrived.

00:10:21.743 --> 00:10:25.250
The devil is in the details,
and yours are incorrect.

00:10:25.283 --> 00:10:27.220
He doesn't call me Mystvearn.

00:10:27.254 --> 00:10:28.891
He uses my old name: Myst.

00:10:28.924 --> 00:10:30.126
Killvearn : [slight chuckle]

00:10:30.159 --> 00:10:32.932
Now reveal yourself,
you sniveling imposter!

00:10:37.975 --> 00:10:40.380
Avan: Whoops. That was
certainly a mistake.

00:10:40.413 --> 00:10:41.281
[relieved gasp]

00:10:41.315 --> 00:10:43.052
I must be out of practice.

00:10:43.086 --> 00:10:45.758
To overlook something as simple
as your little nicknames.

00:10:45.791 --> 00:10:47.461
I should've known
it was you...

00:10:47.494 --> 00:10:48.764
Avan.

00:10:48.797 --> 00:10:50.166
A Morph spell!

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.468
Huh?

00:10:51.503 --> 00:10:52.672
Just like Zaboera...

00:10:52.705 --> 00:10:54.008
It's a transformation spell.

00:10:54.041 --> 00:10:56.646
He used it to
impersonate Killvearn.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:57.915
Avan: Right you are, Maam.

00:10:57.948 --> 00:10:59.886
I was going to join in
defeating this specter...

00:10:59.919 --> 00:11:01.790
but I noticed Hyunckel
was in the middle of

00:11:01.824 --> 00:11:02.892
solving the mystery.

00:11:02.925 --> 00:11:04.529
So I took Killvearn's
form instead,

00:11:04.562 --> 00:11:07.334
to see if I could help us
arrive at the grand reveal.

00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:09.873
After all, the Reaper
had some inkling...

00:11:09.906 --> 00:11:11.576
It stood to reason
that their history

00:11:11.609 --> 00:11:13.279
could be used
to our advantage -

00:11:13.312 --> 00:11:15.083
and now we know who we face.

00:11:15.116 --> 00:11:15.784
Where's Kill?

00:11:15.817 --> 00:11:17.655
How did you escape the Judge?

00:11:17.689 --> 00:11:18.924
Avan: Must you ask?

00:11:18.957 --> 00:11:21.563
Seeing as I'm here, there
can only be one answer.

00:11:21.597 --> 00:11:23.299
It's quite simple...

00:11:23.332 --> 00:11:25.771
It was the Reaper who lost.

00:11:38.898 --> 00:11:40.300
It's quite simple...

00:11:40.333 --> 00:11:42.772
It was the Reaper who lost.

00:11:42.805 --> 00:11:45.377
Killvearn: If the little brat
defeats Vearn after all,

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.013
then I suppose that's that.

00:11:47.047 --> 00:11:49.051
I may have obligations
to help him,

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:51.255
but it's not as
if I'm duty-bound.

00:11:51.288 --> 00:11:54.328
That's what makes Mystvearn
and I so different.

00:11:54.361 --> 00:11:57.100
[menacing chuckle]

00:11:57.133 --> 00:11:58.236
Avan: Well, don't stop there.

00:11:58.269 --> 00:12:00.741
What else differs
between the two of you?

00:12:09.992 --> 00:12:11.629
Killvearn: It's
just his glove...

00:12:11.662 --> 00:12:13.465
And why is it
filled with sand?

00:12:27.594 --> 00:12:28.731
Killvearn: Avan!

00:12:28.764 --> 00:12:30.500
Surprised, Reaper?

00:12:30.534 --> 00:12:32.605
Quite easy to trick, it seems.

00:12:32.639 --> 00:12:34.308
Avan: I concocted
this enchanted sand

00:12:34.341 --> 00:12:35.878
using Lunar Zoombloom.

00:12:35.911 --> 00:12:38.917
Its properties allow me to
use it as a sort of beacon

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:40.854
which I can use
to track an enemy.

00:12:40.888 --> 00:12:42.391
It also allows me
to transport myself

00:12:42.424 --> 00:12:44.696
anywhere it's been
left with a Zip spell.

00:12:44.729 --> 00:12:46.164
It works across dimensions.

00:12:46.198 --> 00:12:49.304
Even the ones that are
closed off from each other.

00:12:49.338 --> 00:12:52.343
I couldn't just throw it on you
without making you suspicious...

00:12:52.377 --> 00:12:55.383
So I snuck some into my glove
and grabbed ahold of your leg.

00:12:55.416 --> 00:12:58.155
From there, it was merely
a matter of quick reflexes.

00:12:58.188 --> 00:13:00.393
Avan: It might have seemed
like you landed a blow,

00:13:00.427 --> 00:13:03.366
only I retracted my hand
at the last instant...

00:13:03.399 --> 00:13:04.769
Once the glove was out here,

00:13:04.802 --> 00:13:06.740
I had a way to return
this dimension...

00:13:06.773 --> 00:13:08.510
with you none the wiser.

00:13:08.543 --> 00:13:10.914
When the Judge began
his destruction sequence,

00:13:10.948 --> 00:13:12.951
it was the last
gamble I could make.

00:13:12.985 --> 00:13:14.822
Killvearn: Cheap
parlor tricks...

00:13:14.855 --> 00:13:16.760
Any fool can make
enchanted sand.

00:13:16.793 --> 00:13:19.031
But how? How are
you still alive?!

00:13:19.064 --> 00:13:21.603
No one survives Megante!

00:13:21.637 --> 00:13:22.838
Avan: I don't know.

00:13:22.872 --> 00:13:25.243
Honestly, I can only
call it a miracle.

00:13:25.276 --> 00:13:27.615
I may be the one human
in history who's suffered

00:13:27.648 --> 00:13:30.988
the wrath of a Megante spell
more than once in his lifetime.

00:13:31.022 --> 00:13:33.292
But since I've survived,
all that remains to do

00:13:33.325 --> 00:13:35.030
with this life I've
been allowed to keep...

00:13:35.063 --> 00:13:36.867
is use it against you.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.970
Prepare yourself, Killvearn.

00:13:39.471 --> 00:13:40.941
Wave Strike!

00:13:41.909 --> 00:13:43.479
Killvearn [thought]: He's fast!

00:13:43.513 --> 00:13:45.317
Killvearn [thought]:
Even if he slipped free,

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:46.218
he should be injured -

00:13:46.252 --> 00:13:48.322
Yet he's as strong
and vital as ever...

00:13:48.355 --> 00:13:50.459
As the Reaper,
I dispense fear...

00:13:50.493 --> 00:13:53.767
but this is the first time I'm
experiencing it for myself...

00:13:53.801 --> 00:13:57.641
This man has faced every
trap I could conceive of

00:13:57.675 --> 00:14:00.279
and managed to come
out unscathed...

00:14:02.985 --> 00:14:04.388
Avan: Well? What now?

00:14:04.421 --> 00:14:07.427
You've used all your Phantom
Razors, and your Judge is gone.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.534
I doubt you've had the chance
to prepare any other traps.

00:14:11.903 --> 00:14:14.007
This time, it's really over.

00:14:20.052 --> 00:14:22.057
Killvearn: Oh,
don't worry about me.

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.425
A limb is no loss.

00:14:23.458 --> 00:14:26.833
I can survive anything as
long as my head's attached.

00:14:26.867 --> 00:14:29.137
I assure you, I'm neither
mad nor suicidal,

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:32.043
so any concern is unnecessary!

00:14:37.521 --> 00:14:40.392
Avan [thought]: That sphere...
What is he up to now?

00:14:40.426 --> 00:14:42.330
Killvearn: You won't
survive this.

00:14:42.364 --> 00:14:44.000
One of my arms
should be sufficient

00:14:44.034 --> 00:14:45.738
to bring an end
to your antics.

00:14:45.771 --> 00:14:47.139
It's slightly painful,

00:14:47.173 --> 00:14:49.712
so consider it quite a feat
to compel me to use this...

00:14:49.745 --> 00:14:51.114
Avan, the Hero.

00:14:51.148 --> 00:14:52.685
You're one of the few men

00:14:52.718 --> 00:14:54.922
that the Dark King Vearn
has ever feared.

00:14:54.955 --> 00:14:57.126
Therefore, I offer
a final attack

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.566
worthy of your reputation.

00:14:59.599 --> 00:15:00.835
I call it...

00:15:00.868 --> 00:15:03.673
Incinerating Inferno!

00:15:05.811 --> 00:15:08.082
Avan [thought]: A fireball?!

00:15:08.115 --> 00:15:10.019
Killvearn: My blood has
the same composition

00:15:10.053 --> 00:15:11.556
as Underworld magma.

00:15:11.589 --> 00:15:14.294
Once ignited, it becomes
a scorching blaze -

00:15:14.327 --> 00:15:16.499
and not even you
will endure its heat!

00:15:16.533 --> 00:15:17.434
Avan [thought]: This is it.

00:15:17.467 --> 00:15:19.572
That has to be his
true ace in the hole.

00:15:19.606 --> 00:15:21.943
I doubt it can be
stopped or even dodged...

00:15:21.977 --> 00:15:24.081
which leaves me with
only one option...

00:15:24.114 --> 00:15:26.853
I'll have to counter it using
the best thing I've got.

00:15:26.886 --> 00:15:28.990
Killvearn:
"Avan Strash," is it?

00:15:29.024 --> 00:15:31.061
Why bother?
That's hardly a threat.

00:15:31.094 --> 00:15:33.432
Nothing you have can
compare with this attack.

00:15:33.465 --> 00:15:34.802
The fight is mine.

00:15:34.835 --> 00:15:35.971
Says the man...

00:15:36.005 --> 00:15:37.909
who's in the midst of
the first serious battle

00:15:37.942 --> 00:15:40.146
of his long, cowardly life.

00:15:40.179 --> 00:15:42.017
Killvearn: I won't
allow such insult.

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:45.289
I am the Reaper! I control
the life and death of all!

00:15:45.322 --> 00:15:48.663
I'm the God of Death himself!

00:15:51.035 --> 00:15:52.538
Killvearn: You fool!

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.409
Killvearn: [cackling]

00:15:55.442 --> 00:15:56.478
How exquisite!

00:15:56.513 --> 00:15:59.919
A fitting end to a most
irritating adversary.

00:15:59.953 --> 00:16:05.262
[laughing]

00:16:05.998 --> 00:16:07.133
Killvearn: It can't be!

00:16:07.166 --> 00:16:08.937
I suppose you should've
stuck with something

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:11.075
a little more reliable
for this occasion.

00:16:11.108 --> 00:16:12.645
Farewell, Reaper.

00:16:12.678 --> 00:16:15.449
Avan Strash!

00:16:17.053 --> 00:16:20.292
Killvearn [thought]: No, no.
This is impossible!

00:16:20.326 --> 00:16:23.767
How could he withstand
my Incinerating Inferno?

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.135
H-How?!

00:16:35.957 --> 00:16:37.929
Killvearn [thought]: Hadlar?!

00:16:37.962 --> 00:16:39.331
Avan [thought]: Could it be?

00:16:39.364 --> 00:16:41.970
Back when Hadlar
perished in my arms...

00:16:42.003 --> 00:16:43.640
I was covered in his ashes...

00:16:43.674 --> 00:16:46.312
Is that what protected
me from the Judge's Megante

00:16:46.345 --> 00:16:49.183
and Killvearn's
Incinerating Inferno?

00:16:51.322 --> 00:16:54.061
Hadlar, my old nemesis...

00:16:54.094 --> 00:16:57.400
Is it true?
Did you rescue me?

00:17:11.863 --> 00:17:13.332
Yes, now I have no doubt.

00:17:13.365 --> 00:17:16.138
Hadlar's spirit
somehow saved me twice.

00:17:16.172 --> 00:17:17.875
For him to come to my aid,

00:17:17.908 --> 00:17:20.045
he must've really
detested you, Reaper.

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:21.415
That's less of a surprise.

00:17:21.448 --> 00:17:22.885
Killvearn: How...
dare... you...

00:17:22.919 --> 00:17:26.225
To suggest something as dubious
as a miracle could defeat me?

00:17:26.258 --> 00:17:27.962
Help from beyond the grave?

00:17:27.995 --> 00:17:29.464
I'll tell you what
actually happened.

00:17:29.498 --> 00:17:32.403
Hadlar's body was made
of Superior Being cells.

00:17:32.436 --> 00:17:34.174
They emit Dark Fire Energy...

00:17:34.207 --> 00:17:35.911
And since they
remained in his ashes,

00:17:35.944 --> 00:17:37.881
you were shielded
from the heat.

00:17:37.915 --> 00:17:39.919
That's all there is to it.

00:17:39.953 --> 00:17:41.990
It's the only explanation!

00:17:42.023 --> 00:17:44.962
A miracle... A miracle
could never...

00:17:44.995 --> 00:17:46.231
Avan [thought]:
While he was bragging,

00:17:46.265 --> 00:17:47.668
he gave away his weakness.

00:17:47.701 --> 00:17:50.440
As expected, when
I used my Avan Strash,

00:17:50.473 --> 00:17:53.045
the residual blaze around
me caught onto his body...

00:17:53.079 --> 00:17:55.049
Killvearn: [howling]

00:17:55.083 --> 00:17:56.451
Avan [thought]: And now...

00:17:56.485 --> 00:17:58.857
it just set the magma flowing
through his veins ablaze.

00:17:58.890 --> 00:17:59.859
[horrified cry]

00:17:59.892 --> 00:18:01.763
No, no, no. This is bad!

00:18:01.796 --> 00:18:04.067
This is very bad!

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.206
Piroro: Crack!
Crackle! Kacrack!

00:18:08.041 --> 00:18:09.879
Oh, it's no use!

00:18:09.912 --> 00:18:12.383
I don't have the
Magic Power to save him.

00:18:14.889 --> 00:18:16.526
Please, help me put him out.

00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:19.598
I'm begging you,
Avan, have mercy.

00:18:19.632 --> 00:18:21.368
Please! If we don't
do something soon,

00:18:21.402 --> 00:18:23.005
he'll be reduced to ashes!

00:18:23.038 --> 00:18:24.875
I'll tell him not
to be bad anymore!

00:18:24.908 --> 00:18:27.080
I'll make him
promise! I swear!

00:18:27.114 --> 00:18:28.248
Killvearn: [roaring]

00:18:28.282 --> 00:18:29.853
We're running out of time.

00:18:29.886 --> 00:18:31.722
I'm begging you! Please!

00:18:46.652 --> 00:18:47.921
Killvearn: A-Avan?

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:50.594
Are you okay, master?

00:18:50.628 --> 00:18:51.929
Killvearn: Y-Yes...

00:18:51.963 --> 00:18:55.436
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I think I am, my dear Piroro.

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:58.543
We should thank Avan
properly for such generosity.

00:18:58.576 --> 00:19:01.549
My thoughts exactly.
We owe him.

00:19:03.687 --> 00:19:04.889
Avan: No, thank you.

00:19:04.922 --> 00:19:07.260
Sorry, but you can
keep your gifts.

00:19:07.293 --> 00:19:10.032
I had no doubt that our
battle would lead to this.

00:19:10.065 --> 00:19:11.803
I've encountered many
enemies in my days,

00:19:11.836 --> 00:19:15.075
but none have ever been
so cruel or untrustworthy.

00:19:15.109 --> 00:19:16.746
Killvearn: Come, now.
That's cold.

00:19:16.779 --> 00:19:19.652
You must be repaid for
your troubles. I insist...

00:19:19.685 --> 00:19:22.056
You seemed to enjoy
my Phantom Razors...

00:19:22.089 --> 00:19:23.726
Perhaps you should keep them!

00:19:26.198 --> 00:19:28.035
Yes! Yes! Now we've
got you, dummy.

00:19:28.068 --> 00:19:29.805
[evil giggling]

00:19:29.839 --> 00:19:32.344
Killvearn: You see, with Piroro,
I can restock my blades...

00:19:32.377 --> 00:19:33.646
And as I'm sure you recall,

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.385
only I know where these
13 daggers have been hidden.

00:19:36.418 --> 00:19:38.556
It's what you might
call a reliable trap.

00:19:38.589 --> 00:19:41.294
You came close, but
the tables have turned.

00:19:41.328 --> 00:19:43.265
I already told you.

00:19:43.298 --> 00:19:44.602
I was one-hundred
percent certain

00:19:44.635 --> 00:19:47.072
that our duel would
lead to this moment.

00:19:47.106 --> 00:19:50.312
Which is why I took the liberty
of laying a trap for you.

00:19:50.345 --> 00:19:52.016
You're standing
in it as we speak.

00:19:52.049 --> 00:19:53.185
Killvearn: What?!

00:19:53.218 --> 00:19:54.622
Avan: If you have any
intention of keeping

00:19:54.655 --> 00:19:56.358
the life that
I've spared you...

00:19:56.392 --> 00:19:58.730
then I suggest you
don't move a muscle.

00:19:58.763 --> 00:20:00.266
Fat chance, Hero.

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:02.370
I'm certain of this -
you're bluffing!

00:20:02.404 --> 00:20:03.940
Killvearn: I concur.

00:20:03.973 --> 00:20:05.877
And what a weak bluff at that.

00:20:05.911 --> 00:20:08.015
You? Laid a trap? For me?

00:20:08.049 --> 00:20:09.952
Don't make me laugh!

00:20:22.443 --> 00:20:25.216
Killvearn [thought]:
A... Phantom... Razor?

00:20:25.249 --> 00:20:27.921
But... What was
it doing... here?

00:20:27.955 --> 00:20:28.890
When I was caught by

00:20:28.923 --> 00:20:30.927
your Phantom Razors in
the other dimension,

00:20:30.961 --> 00:20:32.531
that one got stuck in me.

00:20:32.564 --> 00:20:34.434
Piroro might've retrieved
the others for you,

00:20:34.467 --> 00:20:36.572
but I brought this
one back myself.

00:20:36.606 --> 00:20:38.475
There were thirteen
invisible blades in your trap,

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:41.014
however, you also threw
one as a demonstration,

00:20:41.047 --> 00:20:42.752
making a grand
total of fourteen.

00:20:42.785 --> 00:20:45.056
As long as you
didn't know where it was,

00:20:45.089 --> 00:20:46.424
I only needed the one.

00:20:46.457 --> 00:20:49.097
Killvearn: Y-You... planted
it... when you saved me...

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:52.604
D-Didn't you? I got sloppy...

00:21:06.532 --> 00:21:09.471
Piroro: It's no use.
He... He can't be healed.

00:21:09.505 --> 00:21:12.544
Even if they're an immortal,
no living creature is able to

00:21:12.577 --> 00:21:14.648
survive for long
without its head.

00:21:14.682 --> 00:21:17.588
The loser loses their
head, after all. Well...

00:21:17.621 --> 00:21:19.490
If you ask me,
it's a cruel fate,

00:21:19.525 --> 00:21:21.963
but those are the rules
he wanted to play by.

00:21:21.996 --> 00:21:23.699
It was supposed to be you...

00:21:24.234 --> 00:21:26.872
[howling]

00:21:28.441 --> 00:21:30.379
Then you mean
to tell me that...

00:21:30.412 --> 00:21:31.616
Kill was defeated?

00:21:31.649 --> 00:21:33.351
I'm sure that
little familiar of his

00:21:33.385 --> 00:21:36.324
will try to revive him,
but it's a lost cause.

00:21:36.357 --> 00:21:39.698
The Reaper has swung his
scythe for the last time.

00:21:39.731 --> 00:21:42.236
Avan: And now, thanks to
what Hyunckel's surmised,

00:21:42.269 --> 00:21:44.073
along with what
I've heard from you...

00:21:44.107 --> 00:21:45.476
I believe I'm
coming to understand

00:21:45.511 --> 00:21:49.183
the true nature of your
identity, Mystvearn...

00:21:49.217 --> 00:21:51.455
As well... as the
Dark King Vearn's...

00:21:51.488 --> 00:21:53.826
most closely guarded secret.

00:21:56.331 --> 00:21:59.370
Uh, Dai... What is that?

00:23:37.433 --> 00:23:39.103
Narrator: With the
Reaper defeated and

00:23:39.136 --> 00:23:40.473
Mystvearn caught by surprise,

00:23:40.507 --> 00:23:42.911
Avan parts the veil shrouding
Vearn's greatest secret

00:23:42.945 --> 00:23:45.349
and relays his revelation
to his Disciples.

00:23:45.383 --> 00:23:47.555
Meanwhile, ominous
clouds gather above

00:23:47.588 --> 00:23:48.957
the Tower of Supremacy,

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:51.696
where Dai's mighty Doruora
blew the Dark King away.

00:23:51.729 --> 00:23:54.434
And soon, the unraveling
threads of Vearn's mystery

00:23:54.467 --> 00:23:56.506
lead to the rise of
the most powerful threat

00:23:56.539 --> 00:23:57.875
our heroes have ever faced.

00:23:57.908 --> 00:23:59.779
See how it all
unfolds, next time on

00:23:59.812 --> 00:24:02.049
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:02.082 --> 00:24:03.819
"Vearn's Truth."
