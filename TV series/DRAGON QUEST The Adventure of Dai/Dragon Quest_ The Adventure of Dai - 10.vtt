WEBVTT

00:01:50.888 --> 00:01:53.493
All of you fought very well.

00:01:53.528 --> 00:01:57.802
Especially Dai.
This victory was thanks to you!

00:01:59.138 --> 00:02:01.342
You truly have grown
into a young man

00:02:01.375 --> 00:02:04.382
who is worthy to carry
the title of "Hero."

00:02:04.415 --> 00:02:06.219
And, from this day on,

00:02:06.252 --> 00:02:08.758
you may introduce
yourself as such.

00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:10.260
[applauding]

00:02:10.293 --> 00:02:11.864
Congratulations!

00:02:11.897 --> 00:02:13.734
Maam: Your dream came true.

00:02:19.646 --> 00:02:22.451
Your Majesty?
It's too soon for me.

00:02:22.484 --> 00:02:23.319
Huh?!

00:02:23.353 --> 00:02:24.188
[disbelieving grunt]

00:02:24.221 --> 00:02:26.325
What are you talking about?!

00:02:27.662 --> 00:02:30.333
I would have never
won it alone.

00:02:30.366 --> 00:02:33.607
Because you, Maam, Gomechan,
and everyone in the castle

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.146
worked together
for this victory.

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:39.619
If I'm a Hero,
then everyone is a Hero.

00:02:40.253 --> 00:02:42.458
Thank you, Dai...

00:02:42.491 --> 00:02:45.831
Dai: So... until I
get a little stronger

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:48.470
and can fight without
burdening anybody else,

00:02:48.504 --> 00:02:51.275
I can't in good faith
accept this title.

00:02:53.848 --> 00:02:55.618
I'm a bit embarrassed.

00:02:55.651 --> 00:02:57.154
It's admirable.

00:02:57.187 --> 00:03:00.494
Very well. I look forward
to your further growth.

00:03:00.528 --> 00:03:04.101
Shaman Brass, you have
truly raised a good child.

00:03:04.134 --> 00:03:05.671
Oh... Thank you.

00:03:05.704 --> 00:03:10.147
He's my...
He's my pride and joy.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.486
Dai: Knock it off, Grampa.
It's a little much.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.760
You knucklehead.
Nobody asked you!

00:03:16.794 --> 00:03:18.897
[chuckle]

00:03:21.302 --> 00:03:24.810
These gifts are the least
I can do for you three.

00:03:24.843 --> 00:03:26.278
Now, please, try them on

00:03:26.312 --> 00:03:28.784
and then we'll go show
you off to the people.

00:03:30.187 --> 00:03:32.057
King Romos: Everyone
is eager to see

00:03:32.091 --> 00:03:35.263
the heroes who
saved this country.

00:03:37.134 --> 00:03:38.002
[chattering]

00:03:38.035 --> 00:03:39.740
I hear he's still a small boy.

00:03:39.773 --> 00:03:43.046
I'd love to catch a
glimpse of the mighty Hero!

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:48.691
[playing music]

00:03:48.724 --> 00:03:49.660
[excited cheering]

00:03:49.693 --> 00:03:51.830
Those youngsters are
the ones who saved us!

00:03:51.863 --> 00:03:56.640
[excited cheering]

00:03:56.674 --> 00:03:59.044
Man, the real
Heroes look so cool.

00:03:59.078 --> 00:04:01.015
Maybe we should
get new outfits.

00:04:01.048 --> 00:04:02.050
[chuckling]

00:04:02.083 --> 00:04:03.787
You know,
if you fought Dai now,

00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:05.223
you probably wouldn't win.

00:04:05.256 --> 00:04:07.360
Hey - just leave it, will ya?

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:11.335
Masopho [thought]:
It seems as if

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:13.607
you're the real
deal, after all.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.847
Well done.
Good luck to you, boy.

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:19.786
It feels pretty
good to work really hard

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:22.826
and have people thank you
for it like this afterwards.

00:04:22.859 --> 00:04:23.928
Hey, Popp...

00:04:23.961 --> 00:04:28.102
You actually seem a little
cool today. Nice work.

00:04:28.135 --> 00:04:31.075
Wow! Thank you for
all the support!

00:04:31.109 --> 00:04:32.578
[cheering]

00:04:32.612 --> 00:04:35.351
King Romos [thought]: Dai,
listen to them cheer for you...

00:04:35.384 --> 00:04:37.287
It's as clear as day.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.791
While you may not wish it yet,

00:04:38.824 --> 00:04:41.028
I'm sure the people
will speak of you...

00:04:41.062 --> 00:04:43.099
as "Dai, the Little Hero."

00:04:43.132 --> 00:04:44.636
[excited laugh]

00:04:46.974 --> 00:04:48.810
[laughing]

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:53.521
What was that?

00:04:53.554 --> 00:04:55.357
It came from
the Heart Chamber!

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.631
The Heart Chamber?
How curious...

00:04:58.664 --> 00:05:01.402
That's where Magic
Rituals are performed.

00:05:04.576 --> 00:05:09.318
Vearn: This is Kasizz, the most
powerful Heat-type spell.

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:12.191
Along with that
new body of yours,

00:05:12.224 --> 00:05:17.301
consider it your reward
for defeating Avan.

00:05:17.334 --> 00:05:20.575
Magnificent. Now I have
complete mastery

00:05:20.608 --> 00:05:23.981
of both Heat and
Explosion-type spells.

00:05:24.014 --> 00:05:25.885
[evil chuckle]

00:05:28.122 --> 00:05:29.859
Lord Hadlar!

00:05:31.228 --> 00:05:32.999
Hadlar: Zaboera.

00:05:33.033 --> 00:05:37.274
Use your Heyedras and send out
an order to all of our forces.

00:05:37.307 --> 00:05:39.178
[gasp]

00:05:39.212 --> 00:05:41.382
Summon the remaining
Legion Commanders

00:05:41.415 --> 00:05:44.021
here to Sovereign
Rock Castle!

00:05:46.292 --> 00:05:48.931
Brass [thought]: Dai, until
the day when the Dark King is

00:05:48.965 --> 00:05:52.004
finally defeated and
peace is restored,

00:05:52.037 --> 00:05:56.546
we monsters shall live quietly
here on Dermline Island.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.287
So whatever comes next,
don't worry about us.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.025
Fight on with all your might.

00:06:04.328 --> 00:06:05.497
[thrilled laughter]

00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:07.835
Wow! This is
exhilarating, gang!

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:10.440
And can you believe how
King Romos just casually

00:06:10.473 --> 00:06:12.411
lent us an awesome
ship like this?

00:06:12.445 --> 00:06:14.047
He's so magnanimous!

00:06:14.081 --> 00:06:17.889
And boy, oh boy, is this
ship ever fast, as well.

00:06:17.922 --> 00:06:19.491
You like it, Dai?

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:24.603
He's upset. He didn't
even say goodbye to Brass.

00:06:24.636 --> 00:06:27.307
I guess it must've
been too hard for him.

00:06:27.341 --> 00:06:28.610
Oh, I see.

00:06:28.644 --> 00:06:31.516
Well, I guess I'll just
have to cheer him up!

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.654
What's with the long face?

00:06:33.687 --> 00:06:35.925
Look - I know you
care about your old man,

00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.630
but you don't need to worry.
He'll be fine!

00:06:39.097 --> 00:06:40.033
You think so?

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:41.035
Oh, yeah. Totally.

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:43.172
All we've gotta do is
wipe out the Dark King

00:06:43.206 --> 00:06:44.843
and your problem's solved!

00:06:44.876 --> 00:06:46.412
Thank you, Popp...

00:06:47.013 --> 00:06:48.383
And you're right.

00:06:48.416 --> 00:06:50.554
We just have to do our best!

00:06:50.588 --> 00:06:52.526
You betcha. It'll be fine.

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:55.196
You've got some strong
allies behind you.

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:59.205
With me here, you don't have
anything to be afraid of!

00:06:59.238 --> 00:07:00.240
I'm not even kidding.

00:07:00.273 --> 00:07:01.577
After that last battle,

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.216
it feels like my caliber
as a Mage, or even just a man,

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.920
has leveled up like crazy.

00:07:06.953 --> 00:07:09.091
I bet I could
take on an entire-

00:07:09.125 --> 00:07:10.427
[snarling]

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.397
[shrieking]

00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:14.234
[snarling]

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:15.571
[pained roar]

00:07:17.274 --> 00:07:18.944
[trembling]

00:07:18.977 --> 00:07:19.880
What was that?!

00:07:19.913 --> 00:07:22.719
Leveled up like crazy,
huh? You wish.

00:07:22.752 --> 00:07:24.555
Captain: Sorry if
you were startled.

00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:28.664
The ship continuously pours
out Holy Water as she sails.

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:32.539
Your average monster
couldn't even get close to us.

00:07:32.572 --> 00:07:34.174
Huh. Well,
that sounds lavish.

00:07:34.207 --> 00:07:37.147
Nothing like that creaky
old tub we sailed over in.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:37.982
Indeed.

00:07:38.016 --> 00:07:39.485
You could never
make it all the way

00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:41.624
to the Continent of
Holkia with that thing.

00:07:41.657 --> 00:07:43.359
The Continent of Holkia?

00:07:43.392 --> 00:07:44.796
[amused cackle]

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.067
Let me show you on a map.

00:07:50.006 --> 00:07:51.910
At the moment,
we're heading east,

00:07:51.944 --> 00:07:56.285
past Dermline Island toward
the Continent of Holkia.

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:58.857
Papnica is right
in the middle of it.

00:07:58.891 --> 00:08:02.398
Dai: Huh. Dermline
Island is so small.

00:08:02.431 --> 00:08:05.170
But why are you heading
to Papnica anyway?

00:08:05.203 --> 00:08:08.376
There are plenty of other
large countries to visit.

00:08:08.409 --> 00:08:09.311
[playful chuckle]

00:08:09.345 --> 00:08:10.581
If I'm not mistaken,

00:08:10.614 --> 00:08:13.153
Dai wants to see his
beloved princess, of course.

00:08:13.186 --> 00:08:14.321
Isn't that right?

00:08:14.354 --> 00:08:17.662
What? N-N-No. Stop it!
Th-that's not the only reason!

00:08:17.695 --> 00:08:19.565
His beloved princess?

00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:22.103
Yeah, he's friends with
the princess of Papnica,

00:08:22.137 --> 00:08:23.841
and he's got a big crush.

00:08:23.874 --> 00:08:24.976
So, you see,

00:08:25.009 --> 00:08:26.913
that's why he wants to rescue
her from the Dark Army.

00:08:26.947 --> 00:08:28.517
He's just trying
to impress her.

00:08:28.551 --> 00:08:30.153
Wow. I didn't know.

00:08:30.186 --> 00:08:32.959
Seems like you're quite the
ladies' man, aren't you, Dai?

00:08:32.992 --> 00:08:35.430
Look - I told you,
that's not it!

00:08:35.463 --> 00:08:38.369
Uh-huh. See him blush?
Isn't it adorable?

00:08:38.402 --> 00:08:41.408
Ah, I see.
The princess of Papnica...

00:08:41.442 --> 00:08:43.246
I guess you haven't
heard the news?

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.348
Huh?

00:08:44.382 --> 00:08:45.851
What do you mean?
Is there a problem?

00:08:47.522 --> 00:08:49.926
The Dark Army has
sent out their legions

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.699
to invade every single
one of the continents,

00:08:52.732 --> 00:08:54.936
but I understand
the battle in Papnica

00:08:54.969 --> 00:08:56.974
has been the most hard fought.

00:08:57.007 --> 00:08:57.909
[worried breaths]

00:08:57.942 --> 00:09:00.246
From what I've heard,
fifteen years ago,

00:09:00.279 --> 00:09:02.384
Holkia was the
Dark Lord Hadlar's

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:04.523
main base of operations.

00:09:04.556 --> 00:09:05.791
Lord Hadlar?

00:09:05.824 --> 00:09:08.429
Apparently, that's why
the most terrifying Legion

00:09:08.462 --> 00:09:10.568
in all of the
Dark Army has been sent

00:09:10.601 --> 00:09:13.507
to take control of
the entire continent.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.745
The reports say it's
a legion of immortals

00:09:15.778 --> 00:09:17.649
who are known as the Undead.

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:19.786
A legion of immortals...

00:09:25.263 --> 00:09:26.666
Dai [thought]: Leona...

00:09:33.413 --> 00:09:36.786
I'll be there soon.
Just hold on!

00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:48.142
[pained yell]

00:09:52.518 --> 00:09:56.258
[snide laugh]

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.070
They're all so frail!

00:10:02.104 --> 00:10:06.580
Why do humans have such fragile
bodies? It's such a let-down.

00:10:06.613 --> 00:10:07.849
[amused chuckle]

00:10:07.882 --> 00:10:10.954
If these are supposed
to be their best warriors,

00:10:10.988 --> 00:10:13.660
then this country is
all but mine!

00:10:13.693 --> 00:10:15.731
Fire minion:
Master Flazzard!

00:10:16.431 --> 00:10:18.102
Master Flazzard!

00:10:18.135 --> 00:10:19.338
Flazzard: What?!

00:10:19.371 --> 00:10:22.545
Master! We just received an
urgent message from a Heyedra.

00:10:22.578 --> 00:10:26.219
All Legion Commanders are to
gather at Sovereign Rock Castle!

00:10:26.252 --> 00:10:29.993
Why all of us together?
Did they say what's going on?

00:10:30.026 --> 00:10:32.865
Yes, master! It seems
a new young Hero has risen

00:10:32.898 --> 00:10:35.404
and defeated Crocodine
the Beast King.

00:10:35.437 --> 00:10:37.106
Really, now. Crocodine?

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.079
Well, I see.
So it's an emergency.

00:10:40.113 --> 00:10:43.788
So be it, then. I will
go to Sovereign Rock Castle.

00:10:43.821 --> 00:10:45.758
You finish off this
country yourselves!

00:10:45.791 --> 00:10:46.660
Both: Yes, sir!

00:10:46.693 --> 00:10:48.797
Flazzard: Show no mercy.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:52.772
Burn the villages and
put any survivors on ice!

00:10:52.805 --> 00:10:54.809
Leave no trace of the humans,

00:10:54.842 --> 00:10:59.519
be it house, or field,
or even livestock! Understand?!

00:10:59.552 --> 00:11:01.154
Both: Y-Yes, sir!

00:11:17.354 --> 00:11:20.595
Monster: Blizzblaze General
Flazzard has arrived.

00:11:20.628 --> 00:11:22.899
Zaboera: Ah, Flazzard!

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:25.604
Oh, it's Zaboera the old man.

00:11:25.638 --> 00:11:27.341
Fast as ever, I see.

00:11:27.374 --> 00:11:28.844
You live up to your name of

00:11:28.877 --> 00:11:31.716
"Blitz Captain
of the Dark Army."

00:11:31.749 --> 00:11:35.490
I heard Crocodine was
defeated. Truly pathetic.

00:11:35.524 --> 00:11:37.962
To lose to a mere human kid.

00:11:37.995 --> 00:11:40.433
Zaboera: That boy
Dai may be human,

00:11:40.466 --> 00:11:43.541
but he is not to
be underestimated.

00:11:43.574 --> 00:11:44.642
Oh, really?

00:11:44.675 --> 00:11:46.445
I offered him
a flawless scheme

00:11:46.479 --> 00:11:50.721
and still the so-called
Beast King managed to lose.

00:11:50.754 --> 00:11:52.692
He's being kept
in Resurrection Fluid,

00:11:52.725 --> 00:11:56.132
but his chances are
fifty percent at best.

00:11:56.165 --> 00:11:59.672
Flazzard: If whoever caused this
damage is really just a kid,

00:11:59.706 --> 00:12:02.043
then he's a true monster.

00:12:02.077 --> 00:12:05.283
No one, no matter
how strong they are,

00:12:05.316 --> 00:12:06.519
should be able to damage

00:12:06.552 --> 00:12:08.924
Crocodine's steel
body like this.

00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:13.065
That means this Dai must possess
more than just physical power.

00:12:13.099 --> 00:12:16.271
Zaboera [thought]: Not bad,
Blizzblaze General Flazzard.

00:12:16.305 --> 00:12:20.480
You're more than just some
hot-blooded brawler, aren't you?

00:12:20.514 --> 00:12:22.618
Having both flaming brutality

00:12:22.652 --> 00:12:26.058
and ice-cold
cunningness as well...

00:12:26.526 --> 00:12:28.129
Baran: I concur.

00:12:28.162 --> 00:12:29.197
Flazzard: Baran!

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:33.439
This fledgling Hero
possesses immense potential.

00:12:33.472 --> 00:12:35.611
I didn't think you'd make it.

00:12:35.645 --> 00:12:36.679
[chuckle]

00:12:36.713 --> 00:12:38.116
My sympathies, pal.

00:12:38.149 --> 00:12:41.523
Heading off to take Ringaia
only to be summoned right back?

00:12:41.556 --> 00:12:43.492
It's a cruel joke.

00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:46.365
Save your sympathies.

00:12:46.398 --> 00:12:49.204
The Ringaia Kingdom
has been destroyed.

00:12:49.237 --> 00:12:51.308
-Zaboera: Really, so fast?
-Flazzard: What? No way.

00:12:51.341 --> 00:12:52.377
Baran: Come along.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:55.349
Lord Hadlar awaits in
the Left Shoulder Chamber.

00:12:55.383 --> 00:12:58.891
He wiped out the entire
Fortress Kingdom of Ringaia

00:12:58.924 --> 00:13:00.493
in such a short time?

00:13:00.527 --> 00:13:05.002
He's as powerful as a
wrathful god, always has been.

00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:07.407
Thank you all
for coming so far.

00:13:08.442 --> 00:13:10.915
Flazzard [thought]: Hmm.
I see Master Hadlar

00:13:10.948 --> 00:13:12.685
has gained even more power.

00:13:12.719 --> 00:13:16.593
Zaboera [thought]: It feels as
if he's overflowing with energy.

00:13:16.626 --> 00:13:19.599
Baran [thought]: It appears
his seat as Dark Commander

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:22.170
remains secure for now.

00:13:22.203 --> 00:13:25.209
We're still missing
Hyunckel and Mystvearn.

00:13:25.243 --> 00:13:29.484
Who in the blazes would be
late for an emergency summons?

00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:30.855
Come now, Flazzard.

00:13:30.888 --> 00:13:32.925
You really haven't noticed?

00:13:32.959 --> 00:13:35.229
Mystvearn is seated
right next to you.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.704
Flazzard: You...
How did you...

00:13:38.737 --> 00:13:39.872
[annoyed grunt]

00:13:39.905 --> 00:13:42.544
Every time... I hate
it when he does that.

00:13:42.578 --> 00:13:44.414
Then that just
leaves Hyunckel.

00:13:44.448 --> 00:13:49.992
Sadly, it appears I must
apologize to all of you.

00:13:50.026 --> 00:13:52.865
I had intended
to gather our forces

00:13:52.898 --> 00:13:56.105
in order to obliterate
the new Hero, Dai.

00:13:56.138 --> 00:13:58.810
But Dark King Vearn
has a different notion,

00:13:58.844 --> 00:14:01.281
and he has made
a direct order.

00:14:01.315 --> 00:14:04.923
He gave the task of
defeating the boy to Hyunckel,

00:14:04.956 --> 00:14:07.728
and we are not to interfere.

00:14:07.761 --> 00:14:09.632
Unbelievable.

00:14:11.068 --> 00:14:13.507
Captain: Is this really
the famously scenic

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.142
port city of Papnica?!

00:14:15.176 --> 00:14:17.047
Captain, this place
is dangerous.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.182
Once we're off the ship,

00:14:18.216 --> 00:14:20.487
get as far away from
here as you can!

00:14:20.521 --> 00:14:21.924
Hey, wait! Are you sure?

00:14:21.957 --> 00:14:24.328
If he does that,
what about our ride back?

00:14:24.361 --> 00:14:27.735
Look, this isn't the time
to be worried about that!

00:14:27.768 --> 00:14:29.370
Hey, wait up, Dai!

00:14:34.014 --> 00:14:36.151
Dai [thought]:
Please be okay, Leona.

00:14:44.569 --> 00:14:47.073
Dai: Leona!

00:14:47.542 --> 00:14:49.812
[sobbing]

00:14:49.846 --> 00:14:51.014
Oh, Dai...

00:14:51.048 --> 00:14:54.454
We were too late.
This is terrible...

00:14:54.487 --> 00:14:55.657
[surprised chirp]

00:14:58.797 --> 00:15:00.099
[frightened yells]

00:15:01.569 --> 00:15:02.304
[terrified yelp]

00:15:02.337 --> 00:15:03.806
S-Sk-Sk-Skeletons!

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.011
This must be the
legion of immortals.

00:15:06.045 --> 00:15:07.981
They invaded this country!

00:15:09.618 --> 00:15:12.624
Calm down, Dai. We're
clearly outnumbered here.

00:15:15.429 --> 00:15:16.198
Oh, fine then.

00:15:16.231 --> 00:15:18.101
It looks like
we have to fight!

00:15:22.711 --> 00:15:24.047
[surprised grunts]

00:15:27.621 --> 00:15:28.524
Who is that guy?

00:15:28.557 --> 00:15:30.894
That was the Avan
Style Sword Technique...

00:15:30.927 --> 00:15:32.096
An Earth Slash!

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:34.568
Then he's one of Avan's
students, like we are?

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.283
I didn't know there
were other users of

00:15:42.317 --> 00:15:44.187
the Avan Style
Sword Technique.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.091
Well, if he's a
Disciple of Avan,

00:15:46.124 --> 00:15:48.028
then I'm positive
he'll join us!

00:15:48.062 --> 00:15:49.565
Popp: Are you
sure about that?

00:15:49.599 --> 00:15:52.270
Because I think he has
the face of a villain.

00:15:53.105 --> 00:15:55.243
Thank you for saving us!

00:15:55.276 --> 00:15:58.248
So you're a student
of Master Avan, too?

00:15:59.084 --> 00:16:01.054
Just who are you, kid?

00:16:05.063 --> 00:16:08.202
It is indeed true that I
learned to fight from Avan.

00:16:08.235 --> 00:16:11.241
And if I'm to be
called a student of his,

00:16:11.275 --> 00:16:15.884
well, then I suppose
I would in fact be the first.

00:16:15.918 --> 00:16:17.955
Hang on... You're
his first student?!

00:16:17.988 --> 00:16:19.324
That's amazing!

00:16:20.426 --> 00:16:22.063
Popp [thought]:
What a freaky sword.

00:16:22.096 --> 00:16:25.102
I've never seen a blade
so ominous looking.

00:16:26.371 --> 00:16:30.146
He's got a strange,
malicious feel to him.

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.150
Is he really on our side?

00:16:32.184 --> 00:16:34.822
So, tell us, what
happened to this country?

00:16:34.855 --> 00:16:36.358
Hyunckel: It fell
to the Dark Army's

00:16:36.391 --> 00:16:38.596
Undead Legion two days ago.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:41.669
The Undead Legion?
You mean those skeletons?

00:16:41.703 --> 00:16:42.939
And Leona?

00:16:42.972 --> 00:16:45.511
What happened to the
princess of this country?

00:16:45.544 --> 00:16:50.119
No idea. I was wondering
about that myself.

00:16:50.152 --> 00:16:53.259
Absolute nonsense.
It's an outrage. Hyunckel?!

00:16:53.292 --> 00:16:54.762
That little pipsqueak.

00:16:54.795 --> 00:16:56.132
I never liked the fact that

00:16:56.165 --> 00:16:58.268
even though he's just
a pathetic human,

00:16:58.302 --> 00:17:01.710
he was still accepted as
one of us Legion Commanders!

00:17:01.743 --> 00:17:03.212
[frustrated grunt]

00:17:03.245 --> 00:17:05.083
Calm yourself,
my good Flazzard.

00:17:05.116 --> 00:17:06.886
You're heating the place up.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.090
How am I supposed to
calm myself?!

00:17:09.124 --> 00:17:11.295
I do understand your rage.

00:17:11.328 --> 00:17:13.567
But this was our
Dark King's decision,

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.071
and it's not our
place to question him.

00:17:16.105 --> 00:17:18.544
The whole thing
was Hyunckel's idea.

00:17:18.577 --> 00:17:20.079
You know how he can be!

00:17:20.112 --> 00:17:22.685
Just because the Dark King
took a liking to him,

00:17:22.718 --> 00:17:24.254
he gets all arrogant!

00:17:24.287 --> 00:17:26.324
That conniving brat...

00:17:26.358 --> 00:17:28.897
[chuckle]

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:30.466
Baran [thought]:
Mystvearn...

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.303
Zaboera [thought]:
The shadow being...

00:17:32.337 --> 00:17:36.077
Known to remain silent
for decades at a time.

00:17:36.111 --> 00:17:37.814
Flazzard [thought]:
He's laughing!

00:17:39.284 --> 00:17:43.660
Mystvearn: The Dark King's words
take precedence above all.

00:17:43.693 --> 00:17:45.163
Exactly right.

00:17:45.196 --> 00:17:48.570
We have no choice
but to obey his will.

00:17:48.603 --> 00:17:49.506
[frustrated growl]

00:17:49.539 --> 00:17:51.976
And besides, he is
the perfect candidate.

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:55.082
If we want to wipe this
new Hero off the board,

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:56.886
there's no one better
to do it than Hyunckel.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.523
Hadlar: After all...

00:18:03.131 --> 00:18:06.004
Maam: We were lucky to
meet you here when we did.

00:18:06.038 --> 00:18:08.408
Join us, and let's
all fight together.

00:18:09.144 --> 00:18:10.379
No, hold it!

00:18:11.382 --> 00:18:13.085
I'm telling you, guys.
Something is off here!

00:18:13.118 --> 00:18:15.056
What the heck are
you talking about, Popp?

00:18:15.089 --> 00:18:16.526
Yeah, come on.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.099
Only a student of Master Avan
could use Earth Slash, right?

00:18:20.133 --> 00:18:22.103
If you're really
one of his students,

00:18:22.136 --> 00:18:25.076
then you should have an
Insignia of Avan like us.

00:18:25.109 --> 00:18:26.779
You mean this?

00:18:29.351 --> 00:18:30.954
Well, don't I feel dumb...

00:18:30.988 --> 00:18:32.023
See? It's all fine.

00:18:32.056 --> 00:18:34.094
We're gonna need
all the help we can get,

00:18:34.127 --> 00:18:35.430
so what d'you say?

00:18:35.463 --> 00:18:39.170
Fight with us! We'll take
on the Dark Army together.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:46.820
[menacing laugh]

00:18:46.853 --> 00:18:48.557
Okay... what's so funny?

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:49.559
[chuckling]

00:18:49.592 --> 00:18:52.097
I was just laughing
at what complete fools

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.635
the three of you have
turned out to be.

00:18:54.669 --> 00:18:55.670
I knew it!

00:19:00.179 --> 00:19:01.348
[alarmed chirp]

00:19:08.429 --> 00:19:09.698
What's the meaning of this?

00:19:09.732 --> 00:19:13.171
I told you guys. This creep
is a villain after all!

00:19:14.842 --> 00:19:16.077
Yeah, but his insignia!

00:19:16.111 --> 00:19:18.616
It's probably just
a fake or something.

00:19:19.886 --> 00:19:22.524
Oh, no. It isn't a fake.

00:19:22.558 --> 00:19:26.197
The truth is, not all students
of Avan respect their teacher

00:19:26.231 --> 00:19:28.871
and love justice
like you three.

00:19:28.904 --> 00:19:30.541
Some of us love chaos,

00:19:30.574 --> 00:19:33.847
and have embraced
the darkness instead.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.051
After seeing just how weak...

00:19:36.084 --> 00:19:38.221
justice really is!

00:19:38.489 --> 00:19:39.290
But...

00:19:40.059 --> 00:19:42.698
My name is Hyunckel.

00:19:42.732 --> 00:19:45.303
One of the Six Commanders
of the Dark Army;

00:19:45.336 --> 00:19:47.775
leader of the Undead Legion!

00:19:47.808 --> 00:19:50.748
Wait, hang on... How could
a student of Master Avan

00:19:50.781 --> 00:19:53.285
be a Legion Commander
of the Dark Army?!

00:19:53.318 --> 00:19:54.488
Popp: Traitor.

00:19:54.522 --> 00:19:55.523
Frizz!

00:19:56.726 --> 00:19:59.632
These are corpse warriors
who have surpassed even death.

00:19:59.665 --> 00:20:03.271
Hyunckel: They will not stop
their assault unless pulverized!

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.979
Wait, Hyunckel.
Haven't you heard?

00:20:07.012 --> 00:20:08.315
Master Avan...

00:20:08.348 --> 00:20:10.219
He was defeated
by the Dark Army.

00:20:10.253 --> 00:20:11.355
He's gone.

00:20:11.388 --> 00:20:13.727
Yes, I heard about it.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.864
Word is, Hadlar did it.

00:20:15.897 --> 00:20:19.605
And yet you're still
fighting for the Dark Army?!

00:20:19.638 --> 00:20:22.009
I'll admit it was
quite a shock.

00:20:23.513 --> 00:20:27.554
To be defeated by the
very enemy he once bested?

00:20:27.588 --> 00:20:29.658
Hyunckel: That's what he
gets for taking on students

00:20:29.691 --> 00:20:32.564
and neglecting
his own training.

00:20:33.432 --> 00:20:34.535
For what it's worth,

00:20:34.568 --> 00:20:37.641
I was rather hoping
to kill him myself.

00:20:37.674 --> 00:20:39.310
Such a shame.

00:20:39.343 --> 00:20:42.250
I implored the Dark King
to give me an opportunity

00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:44.721
to defeat Avan's
students instead;

00:20:44.755 --> 00:20:47.360
however, now that I see
they're weaklings like you,

00:20:47.393 --> 00:20:50.099
I can't tell which
is more disappointing.

00:20:50.132 --> 00:20:51.802
[attacking yell]

00:20:53.405 --> 00:20:55.343
A decent Earth Slash...

00:20:55.376 --> 00:20:57.380
Don't disrespect my Master!

00:20:57.413 --> 00:21:01.055
I'm not gonna let you talk
like that! Take it back!

00:21:01.088 --> 00:21:02.924
How very interesting.

00:21:04.394 --> 00:21:07.366
Now tell me.
What if I say I won't?

00:21:07.399 --> 00:21:08.803
I'll do this!

00:21:09.872 --> 00:21:11.709
He blocked an Earth Slash?!

00:21:13.779 --> 00:21:15.315
Hyunckel:
Reexamine your skills

00:21:15.349 --> 00:21:17.821
before your run
your mouth, boy!

00:21:18.088 --> 00:21:19.323
Come on!

00:21:20.192 --> 00:21:21.261
How about this?!

00:21:21.295 --> 00:21:23.132
Avan Style
Sword Technique...

00:21:23.165 --> 00:21:24.835
Wave Slash!

00:21:31.314 --> 00:21:32.217
This is bad.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:33.352
Hyunckel's sword work

00:21:33.385 --> 00:21:35.690
beats Dai's in both
strength and skill!

00:21:39.765 --> 00:21:43.138
I know all about the
Avan Style Sword Technique.

00:21:43.171 --> 00:21:46.645
Hyunckel: Dodging someone of
your skill is almost too easy.

00:21:47.079 --> 00:21:48.115
It's not over!

00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:49.384
That's the stance...

00:21:49.417 --> 00:21:50.987
Avan Strash!

00:21:55.897 --> 00:21:56.765
[gasp]

00:23:37.199 --> 00:23:40.239
Narrator: After Dai's
Avan Strash has no effect,

00:23:40.272 --> 00:23:41.775
Hyunckel dons
the ultimate armor

00:23:41.809 --> 00:23:44.314
and fights using his
Dark Sword...

00:23:44.347 --> 00:23:45.918
While he mounts a
vicious counter-attack,

00:23:45.951 --> 00:23:48.723
his heart overflows
with intense hatred.

00:23:48.756 --> 00:23:51.662
But when Dai discovers
the source of Hyunckel's rage,

00:23:51.695 --> 00:23:54.668
he'll learn that the past
is a murky battleground.

00:23:54.702 --> 00:23:56.672
Can he defeat
this mysterious foe?

00:23:56.705 --> 00:23:58.442
Find out on
the next episode of

00:23:58.475 --> 00:24:00.881
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:00.914 --> 00:24:03.184
"Hyunckel
the Dark Swordsman".
