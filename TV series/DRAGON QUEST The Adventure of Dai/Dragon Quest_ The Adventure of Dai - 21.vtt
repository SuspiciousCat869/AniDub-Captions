WEBVTT

00:01:54.262 --> 00:01:57.201
Leona: Hold still.
Just a little longer.

00:01:57.234 --> 00:01:58.436
Marin: Yes.

00:02:01.543 --> 00:02:02.545
[defeated sigh]

00:02:02.578 --> 00:02:03.313
It's no good.

00:02:03.347 --> 00:02:04.583
What? Even for you?

00:02:04.616 --> 00:02:07.254
Whoever made this must
have been a genius.

00:02:07.288 --> 00:02:09.593
It's completely beyond me.

00:02:09.626 --> 00:02:10.494
Oh...

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:11.897
Soldier: Everybody -
come check it out!

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:13.333
Soldier: What's going on?

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:15.270
Lady Marin of the Troika...

00:02:23.153 --> 00:02:24.155
Maam: Is that Fullheal?

00:02:24.188 --> 00:02:25.190
That's right.

00:02:25.224 --> 00:02:27.127
It's the most
powerful Heal Spell

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.398
that Princess Leona can cast.

00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:32.538
Baduck: It cures even
the most severe injuries.

00:02:33.907 --> 00:02:36.614
There. You should
be all better.

00:02:36.647 --> 00:02:38.116
Thank you so much.

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:39.987
I owe you... my life.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.456
Oh, it's nothing.

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.627
Anything for
a friend in need.

00:02:43.661 --> 00:02:45.330
Princess.

00:02:45.364 --> 00:02:46.767
I'm glad you're all right.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.236
Sister!

00:02:49.807 --> 00:02:51.777
Leona's so amazing.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.012
Well, obviously.

00:02:53.046 --> 00:02:55.951
She's a Sage in
training after all.

00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:57.589
She can even use
attack spells,

00:02:57.622 --> 00:03:00.460
though the Troika have
a bit more strength.

00:03:00.494 --> 00:03:03.534
Truly an all-around
spell caster!

00:03:04.402 --> 00:03:06.574
Is something wrong, Maam?

00:03:06.607 --> 00:03:09.444
Maam: I'm going to
talk to Uncle Matoriv.

00:03:09.478 --> 00:03:11.950
Maybe he can fix
my Magic Bullet Gun.

00:03:12.852 --> 00:03:13.954
Maam - wait!

00:03:24.308 --> 00:03:27.448
Your Magic Power seems
to have increased.

00:03:27.481 --> 00:03:29.853
Popp: Don't let
that surprise you.

00:03:29.886 --> 00:03:31.422
Sizz!

00:03:35.063 --> 00:03:36.934
Hang in there! You're close!

00:03:36.968 --> 00:03:38.971
[struggling grunts]

00:03:39.472 --> 00:03:40.473
Crack.

00:03:44.616 --> 00:03:45.718
And now, Boom.

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:48.857
Oh, no!

00:03:57.174 --> 00:03:59.278
Matoriv: The Flight
Spell, Levizoom.

00:03:59.311 --> 00:04:00.982
Now, when did you learn that?

00:04:01.015 --> 00:04:01.984
[proud chuckle]

00:04:02.017 --> 00:04:03.887
It's easy if you
already know Zoom!

00:04:04.923 --> 00:04:05.925
Levizoom.

00:04:09.766 --> 00:04:12.003
[pained yell]

00:04:12.973 --> 00:04:14.308
Matoriv: Don't get smug.

00:04:14.341 --> 00:04:17.615
I may be old, but in a
one-minute, one-on-one fight,

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:20.087
there isn't a being on
the face of this earth

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.592
who can defeat me with magic.

00:04:24.395 --> 00:04:26.299
Nasty, bitter old man...

00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:27.769
Matoriv, c'mon!

00:04:27.802 --> 00:04:30.575
Can't you teach me
some cool spells, too?

00:04:30.608 --> 00:04:33.981
Not while I'm having you
do basic meditation.

00:04:34.014 --> 00:04:37.922
Yeah, but... You're teaching
Popp and he's improving so much!

00:04:37.956 --> 00:04:39.258
[chirping]

00:04:39.292 --> 00:04:40.460
You fool.

00:04:40.493 --> 00:04:43.200
What use is it knowing
all the same spells

00:04:43.233 --> 00:04:44.903
that your friend does?

00:04:44.937 --> 00:04:45.838
Dai: Huh?!

00:04:47.207 --> 00:04:48.510
I don't get it!

00:04:48.544 --> 00:04:50.614
Matoriv: A Hero
can do anything.

00:04:50.648 --> 00:04:53.688
Although a Warrior may
possess more strength,

00:04:53.721 --> 00:04:56.693
and a Mage can
perform more magic...

00:04:56.727 --> 00:04:59.331
Matoriv: A Hero is
a jack-of-all-trades

00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:01.335
and master of none.

00:05:05.243 --> 00:05:10.320
But they do possess an ultimate
weapon that no one else has.

00:05:10.821 --> 00:05:11.422
And what's that?

00:05:11.456 --> 00:05:13.661
Matoriv: Isn't it obvious?

00:05:13.694 --> 00:05:16.600
A Hero's weapon is courage.

00:05:16.633 --> 00:05:17.869
Courage?

00:05:17.903 --> 00:05:21.309
Matoriv: You can face any enemy
with the right kind of courage.

00:05:21.342 --> 00:05:22.779
Understand?

00:05:22.813 --> 00:05:26.352
Popp here's not going to improve
his magical skills on his own.

00:05:27.555 --> 00:05:29.491
Matoriv: That makes a party.

00:05:29.525 --> 00:05:31.796
That's what
companions are for.

00:05:33.668 --> 00:05:35.103
Popp [thought]:
Courage, huh?

00:05:35.136 --> 00:05:37.440
I suppose that's
something I don't have.

00:05:37.474 --> 00:05:39.344
Maam [thought]:
A weapon of my own.

00:05:39.378 --> 00:05:41.448
That's it. Without that...

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:44.355
[pained groan]

00:05:44.388 --> 00:05:46.727
But I didn't even do anything!

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.465
Just your presence
is bad enough!

00:05:49.498 --> 00:05:52.137
Then I'll hide my presence.

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:54.041
Why, you...

00:05:56.747 --> 00:05:57.949
Interesting.

00:05:57.982 --> 00:06:00.921
You really did inherit your
father's strength, didn't you?

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.931
Maam [thought]: Strength?
My father's strength!

00:06:08.904 --> 00:06:12.244
Amy: Papnica Kingdom
is starting to rebuild.

00:06:12.277 --> 00:06:15.017
Apollo: The citizens are all
returning now that they've heard

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.020
Dai defeated the Dark Army.

00:06:17.053 --> 00:06:20.326
Indeed. Repairs are almost
complete on the temple.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.697
Yes, and after that,

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.301
we can get started on
the palace, Your Highness.

00:06:24.335 --> 00:06:26.940
I see. It sounds like
things are going well.

00:06:26.974 --> 00:06:30.313
Which just leaves the
three of us, you guys.

00:06:30.347 --> 00:06:34.154
The Dark Army's fortress is here
in the mountains of Guildmain.

00:06:34.187 --> 00:06:35.825
Maam says Crocodine
and Hyunckel

00:06:35.858 --> 00:06:39.331
are on their way
there to scout the area.

00:06:39.364 --> 00:06:40.868
Okay, well, what should we do?

00:06:40.901 --> 00:06:44.976
Currently, our forces lack
both weapons and manpower.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:46.312
So rather than attacking,

00:06:46.346 --> 00:06:48.651
we should focus on
building up our strength.

00:06:48.684 --> 00:06:49.786
Alright.

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:52.324
Then why don't we all go
and look for some new weapons.

00:06:52.357 --> 00:06:54.963
Sounds good to me.
What do you think, Maam?

00:06:56.265 --> 00:06:58.704
Uh, Maam, what's wrong?

00:06:58.737 --> 00:07:03.212
Listen, everyone.
I've been thinking...

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.155
I'm going... my own
way for a while.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.101
What?! How come?
Why so sudden?

00:07:14.134 --> 00:07:18.075
With my weapon broken,
I can't use Attack Spells.

00:07:18.109 --> 00:07:23.086
Plus, Leona... is far
better at Heal Spells.

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:26.893
At this rate, I'm going
to end up being a burden.

00:07:27.427 --> 00:07:28.864
But, that's not true!

00:07:28.897 --> 00:07:31.002
She's right.
You should listen.

00:07:31.035 --> 00:07:32.204
Leona?

00:07:32.237 --> 00:07:33.674
From now on...

00:07:33.708 --> 00:07:36.412
We're going to be facing more
powerful enemies than before.

00:07:36.445 --> 00:07:38.650
And without trying
to get stronger,

00:07:38.684 --> 00:07:41.088
any one of us could
become a burden.

00:07:41.122 --> 00:07:43.493
That's a... little harsh.

00:07:43.527 --> 00:07:46.198
You never hold back, Leona.

00:07:47.702 --> 00:07:51.175
I really admire that.
So, thank you.

00:07:55.216 --> 00:07:59.626
I've decided; I'm going to
return to Romos to train...

00:07:59.659 --> 00:08:02.430
To find something
only I can do.

00:08:02.464 --> 00:08:05.269
What's something
only you can do?

00:08:06.271 --> 00:08:07.207
Martial arts.

00:08:07.241 --> 00:08:08.376
Both: Martial arts?!

00:08:08.409 --> 00:08:09.478
Maam: Right.

00:08:09.513 --> 00:08:12.117
I figured I'd become
a Martial Artist!

00:08:13.453 --> 00:08:15.323
Popp: You're serious?!

00:08:15.356 --> 00:08:20.601
[squawking]

00:08:23.774 --> 00:08:26.479
Hadlar: Hyunckel and
Crocodine have betrayed us.

00:08:26.513 --> 00:08:27.949
Flazzard is dead.

00:08:27.983 --> 00:08:31.088
With the Six Legion Commanders
reduced to only the three of us,

00:08:31.122 --> 00:08:34.629
our forces are at half the
strength that they should be.

00:08:41.543 --> 00:08:44.582
That sound... That's the
sound of the Reaper Flute!

00:08:49.926 --> 00:08:51.262
[laughing]

00:08:51.295 --> 00:08:56.540
See, I told you, Hadlar's
army is falling apart!

00:08:56.573 --> 00:08:58.511
Killvearn: Good boy, Piroro.

00:08:58.544 --> 00:09:00.914
You were wise to inform me.

00:09:06.158 --> 00:09:08.296
Good evening!

00:09:08.329 --> 00:09:12.271
And greetings, inhabitants
of Sovereign Rock Castle.

00:09:12.304 --> 00:09:14.175
Let me introduce myself.

00:09:14.208 --> 00:09:15.978
My name is Killvearn.

00:09:16.011 --> 00:09:17.414
And I'm Piroro!

00:09:17.447 --> 00:09:19.485
Y-you're... Killvearn?

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:21.623
Surely, you've heard of him.

00:09:21.656 --> 00:09:24.629
The Dark King's
personal assassin-

00:09:24.663 --> 00:09:27.368
a deadly reaper who
silently erases

00:09:27.401 --> 00:09:30.407
those who cross His Majesty!

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.609
[chuckling]

00:09:31.643 --> 00:09:34.716
And why is the reaper
here at Sovereign Rock?

00:09:34.749 --> 00:09:38.523
Mystvearn: Has someone's
incompetence warranted a visit?

00:09:38.557 --> 00:09:41.195
Killvearn: This
is surprising, Myst.

00:09:41.229 --> 00:09:44.301
It's been years since
I've heard your voice.

00:09:44.335 --> 00:09:45.838
Surprise, surprise!

00:09:45.871 --> 00:09:48.142
Killvearn:
Something must be wrong.

00:09:48.176 --> 00:09:53.286
Centuries of silence and
now you have so much to say.

00:09:53.319 --> 00:09:56.358
Mystvearn: You're the one
who talks too much, Kill.

00:09:56.392 --> 00:09:57.529
Killvearn: Perhaps.

00:09:57.562 --> 00:09:58.864
[chuckling]

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:01.704
Hadlar [thought]:
These two know each other?

00:10:01.737 --> 00:10:04.107
Killvearn: And now, Hadlar,

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:07.949
I hear your performance has
been slipping as of late.

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:10.287
He's been botching things up!

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.059
Ever since he failed
to take out Dai the Hero,

00:10:13.092 --> 00:10:16.466
Commanders have fallen,
Kingdoms have been reclaimed.

00:10:16.499 --> 00:10:19.004
It's a whole big mess!

00:10:19.037 --> 00:10:20.774
And recently,

00:10:20.808 --> 00:10:24.616
he brought out the whole
army but was still defeated!

00:10:24.649 --> 00:10:25.817
Hadlar: Silence!

00:10:26.452 --> 00:10:27.822
Killvearn: Is it true...

00:10:27.856 --> 00:10:31.229
you let Dai and his
friends beat you?

00:10:31.262 --> 00:10:35.069
The plan to kill the
boy is still in progress.

00:10:35.103 --> 00:10:36.405
In time...

00:10:36.438 --> 00:10:38.275
Killvearn: Then you'd
better hurry up.

00:10:38.309 --> 00:10:42.852
King Vearn is a patient god,
but even he has his limits.

00:10:42.885 --> 00:10:45.824
If you should fail again...

00:10:46.425 --> 00:10:47.962
Go on. If I fail?

00:10:47.995 --> 00:10:49.766
Then what's meant to happen?

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.007
Killvearn: Do I have to
say it? This. Get it?

00:10:55.544 --> 00:10:56.914
Then have no fear!

00:10:56.947 --> 00:11:00.253
I will destroy those
brats without hesitation-

00:11:00.286 --> 00:11:01.690
by my own hand!

00:11:01.723 --> 00:11:03.092
Not so fast!

00:11:04.228 --> 00:11:06.533
Baran: The next
to fight Dai is me,

00:11:06.566 --> 00:11:09.271
Dragon Master General Baran!

00:11:22.798 --> 00:11:23.900
Hadlar: Baran!

00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:25.671
Hadlar [thought]:
It's too soon.

00:11:25.704 --> 00:11:28.810
Has he already destroyed
the Carl Kingdom?

00:11:28.844 --> 00:11:32.885
Our savior Baran! Oh, my!

00:11:32.919 --> 00:11:36.927
Killvearn: Ah, so I guess you've
been saving the best for last.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.033
In that case, I trust
there's no issue.

00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:41.168
Wait, Baran!

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:44.341
In order to regain the
Dark King's trust, I should...

00:11:44.374 --> 00:11:49.886
Dark Commander Hadlar, I am
growing tired of your excuses.

00:11:49.919 --> 00:11:52.625
I now know the reason
why you've been attempting

00:11:52.658 --> 00:11:54.829
to keep me away from the boy.

00:11:54.863 --> 00:11:56.231
Hadlar: What is it, then?!

00:11:56.264 --> 00:11:57.769
It's because...

00:11:57.802 --> 00:12:00.507
The boy...
is a Dragon Knight!

00:12:01.777 --> 00:12:03.580
A... a Dragon Knight?!

00:12:03.613 --> 00:12:05.618
You mean... from the legends?

00:12:05.651 --> 00:12:07.956
Hadlar [thought]:
He finally knows.

00:12:07.989 --> 00:12:10.092
So, leave it to me...

00:12:10.126 --> 00:12:10.828
Commander.

00:12:10.861 --> 00:12:13.332
No, no! There's no way!

00:12:13.366 --> 00:12:15.404
You will do nothing.

00:12:15.437 --> 00:12:17.240
And that is an order.

00:12:17.273 --> 00:12:19.845
Besides, we don't
have any proof yet

00:12:19.879 --> 00:12:21.550
that he really
is a Dragon Knight.

00:12:21.583 --> 00:12:23.687
I need to find out for myself.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.456
And I said no!

00:12:25.891 --> 00:12:27.327
Killvearn: Stop.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.564
How dare you!

00:12:28.597 --> 00:12:32.739
Killvearn: I believe I know
what's going on here, Hadlar.

00:12:32.772 --> 00:12:34.976
If this Dai really
is what you fear,

00:12:35.009 --> 00:12:38.850
you can't let our friend
Baran here near him, can you?

00:12:42.625 --> 00:12:43.693
Killvearn: Oh, well.

00:12:43.727 --> 00:12:46.199
You can all squabble
on your own time.

00:12:46.232 --> 00:12:49.872
I'd like to finish
what I came here for.

00:12:50.574 --> 00:12:52.277
But that's...

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:54.214
The Key of Vearn!

00:12:54.247 --> 00:12:57.120
Killvearn: Crocodine
and Hyunckel, was it?

00:12:57.153 --> 00:13:01.262
Those two know the location
of Sovereign Rock Castle.

00:13:01.295 --> 00:13:05.638
King Vearn has ordered me
to move it... immediately.

00:13:05.671 --> 00:13:06.806
Move the castle?!

00:13:06.839 --> 00:13:08.543
So that's why...

00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:16.224
[squawking]

00:13:18.329 --> 00:13:20.332
It's really happening...

00:13:29.719 --> 00:13:32.357
Hadlar: Sovereign
Rock Castle moves!

00:13:32.391 --> 00:13:36.600
Killvearn: And now, let's all
enjoy a pleasant little stroll.

00:13:36.633 --> 00:13:38.236
Whee-ee! Whee-ee!

00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:39.572
[excited laughter]

00:13:50.928 --> 00:13:52.297
Bye, Maam...

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:53.867
Why doesn't
she just stay here

00:13:53.901 --> 00:13:55.570
and train with
the rest of us?

00:13:56.873 --> 00:13:58.744
Well, Dai, it's an
important decision

00:13:58.777 --> 00:14:00.313
that she needed to make.

00:14:00.346 --> 00:14:02.919
Over the years,
I've heard the stories;

00:14:02.952 --> 00:14:05.156
They say that deep in
the Romos Mountains,

00:14:05.189 --> 00:14:07.828
there lives a
"God of Martial Arts".

00:14:07.861 --> 00:14:10.667
Who cares about some
stupid legend, anyway?

00:14:10.701 --> 00:14:14.876
Just let her go off and be
a Martial Artist or whatever!

00:14:14.909 --> 00:14:17.314
C'mon, Popp. What are
you so sour about?

00:14:17.347 --> 00:14:19.786
Uh, well, I think
Popp is just sad because

00:14:19.819 --> 00:14:21.757
he actually really likes Maam.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:24.427
And you can shut your mouth!

00:14:24.461 --> 00:14:26.264
Oh, really? Is that true?

00:14:26.298 --> 00:14:29.037
Then why don't you go
tell her how you feel?

00:14:29.071 --> 00:14:31.976
I mean, you won't be seeing
her for quite a while.

00:14:33.112 --> 00:14:36.586
A while, huh? Then, maybe...

00:14:37.821 --> 00:14:38.890
It doesn't matter.

00:14:38.924 --> 00:14:41.997
She's already into
someone else anyway.

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:45.070
I see. Well, that explains
why you're all sour.

00:14:45.103 --> 00:14:47.741
So, is this supposed
to be a form of kindness?

00:14:47.775 --> 00:14:50.112
You know, if you
die in battle,

00:14:50.146 --> 00:14:53.419
this might be your final
chance to say goodbye.

00:14:53.453 --> 00:14:56.526
Leona: She'll never
know how you feel.

00:14:56.559 --> 00:14:58.028
Are you fine with that?

00:14:59.599 --> 00:15:03.338
Popp [thought]: This could
be... our final farewell?

00:15:04.141 --> 00:15:05.142
I...

00:15:09.151 --> 00:15:10.419
I...

00:15:11.355 --> 00:15:13.292
Maam! Wait!

00:15:14.394 --> 00:15:18.169
Off he goes!
What happens now?

00:15:18.202 --> 00:15:21.341
Leona... you're enjoying
his struggle, aren't you?

00:15:23.814 --> 00:15:25.115
Popp: Maam!

00:15:25.584 --> 00:15:26.451
Popp?

00:15:29.559 --> 00:15:30.393
What is it?

00:15:30.426 --> 00:15:32.932
You're going to
Nayle Village, right?

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:34.234
I'll take you.

00:15:34.268 --> 00:15:37.206
I can cast a Zoom spell and
get us there instantly.

00:15:38.175 --> 00:15:39.813
Leona: What will he do?

00:15:39.846 --> 00:15:41.850
Will he be able to tell her?

00:15:41.883 --> 00:15:43.119
That was mean, Leona.

00:15:43.152 --> 00:15:45.725
Y'know... To push
Popp like that...

00:15:45.758 --> 00:15:47.227
C'mon, that's not true.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.199
I said what I said
for his benefit.

00:15:50.233 --> 00:15:52.972
It's not good for
one's mental health

00:15:53.005 --> 00:15:55.510
to keep things
bottled up inside.

00:15:56.245 --> 00:15:58.049
Uh-huh, you don't say?

00:15:58.082 --> 00:15:59.819
[excited chuckle]

00:15:59.852 --> 00:16:01.389
I'm sorry. You can't.

00:16:01.422 --> 00:16:04.128
Huh? You're not going
to Nayle Village?

00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:07.300
You said Romos, so I
just thought that...

00:16:07.334 --> 00:16:09.738
Our battle isn't over yet.

00:16:09.772 --> 00:16:13.814
I'm not returning home until
we defeat the Dark Army,

00:16:13.847 --> 00:16:16.686
and avenge Master
Avan like we said.

00:16:16.719 --> 00:16:17.487
[sigh]

00:16:17.521 --> 00:16:18.489
Oh, right...

00:16:18.524 --> 00:16:20.994
Besides, this rumored
God of Martial Arts...

00:16:21.028 --> 00:16:23.399
He's said to live deep
in the Romos mountains.

00:16:23.432 --> 00:16:26.973
Hang on. I trained in the
Romos mountains with mentor.

00:16:27.007 --> 00:16:28.810
I can get you there, easy!

00:16:28.843 --> 00:16:29.845
Maam: But...

00:16:29.879 --> 00:16:33.654
Oh, come on.
We're friends, right?

00:16:33.687 --> 00:16:35.223
You're right about that.

00:16:35.256 --> 00:16:37.528
I guess I'll take you
up on your offer.

00:16:37.561 --> 00:16:38.796
Alright!

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:42.704
Okay. You ready?

00:16:47.347 --> 00:16:48.650
Zoom!

00:16:50.086 --> 00:16:51.722
Leona: Whoa, yes!

00:16:51.756 --> 00:16:53.961
He even put his
arm around her.

00:16:53.994 --> 00:16:55.964
Not a bad job at all.

00:16:55.997 --> 00:16:57.702
Dai [thought]: Good luck, Maam.

00:16:57.735 --> 00:16:59.370
We'll be waiting.

00:17:09.091 --> 00:17:10.828
-[pained groan]
-That hurt...

00:17:10.861 --> 00:17:13.533
Sorry. My landings
aren't so perfect.

00:17:14.001 --> 00:17:15.236
Uh, Popp?

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:17.841
This isn't the
Romos mountains.

00:17:17.875 --> 00:17:19.043
Huh?

00:17:19.913 --> 00:17:24.054
Popp: This is...
the Dark Forest?

00:17:24.087 --> 00:17:26.191
Why did we end up here?

00:17:26.827 --> 00:17:28.195
Popp: Wait, I know!

00:17:29.264 --> 00:17:31.770
This is where the three of
us first met each other.

00:17:31.803 --> 00:17:32.738
Oh...

00:17:39.318 --> 00:17:40.621
Popp: That's right.

00:17:40.654 --> 00:17:43.593
A mental image is the key
when casting Zoom spells.

00:17:43.627 --> 00:17:47.133
So then this place must
be really important to me...

00:17:47.166 --> 00:17:48.636
I remember...

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:52.310
when we first met, we almost
got into a fight right here.

00:17:52.343 --> 00:17:54.080
I'll never forget it.

00:17:58.255 --> 00:18:00.293
Popp [thought]:
Timing feels right.

00:18:00.326 --> 00:18:02.764
Now's my chance to tell her!

00:18:04.702 --> 00:18:05.402
You know...

00:18:05.436 --> 00:18:06.071
Huh?

00:18:06.104 --> 00:18:08.409
You're amazing, Popp.

00:18:08.442 --> 00:18:09.578
Uh, how?

00:18:09.611 --> 00:18:13.553
I mean, it took us days to
sail from Romos to Papnica.

00:18:13.586 --> 00:18:16.491
Now you can just come
back in an instant.

00:18:17.259 --> 00:18:19.430
I mean...
It's nothing impressive.

00:18:19.464 --> 00:18:23.372
When we met, I couldn't
imagine you doing that.

00:18:23.406 --> 00:18:25.510
To be honest, at first...

00:18:25.543 --> 00:18:27.280
I thought that you
were a little...

00:18:27.313 --> 00:18:30.688
Little bit of a
selfish-cowardly-type guy.

00:18:30.721 --> 00:18:32.858
I... can't argue with that.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.264
Maam: But, through
every battle,

00:18:36.297 --> 00:18:39.738
you grew so strong
and so brave.

00:18:39.772 --> 00:18:43.178
It made me realize
how hard you were trying.

00:18:43.211 --> 00:18:45.216
Then you kept
getting stronger,

00:18:45.249 --> 00:18:48.021
and learned new
spells so fast...

00:18:48.054 --> 00:18:51.161
and you saved me
again, and again.

00:18:51.194 --> 00:18:53.733
Even when we fought Hadlar.

00:18:54.167 --> 00:18:55.203
Maam...

00:18:55.236 --> 00:18:58.342
That's why, after
that last battle,

00:18:58.376 --> 00:19:01.682
I decided I wanted
to catch up to you.

00:19:04.121 --> 00:19:06.291
You can't just keep
rescuing me...

00:19:06.324 --> 00:19:08.161
Not all the time.

00:19:10.534 --> 00:19:12.036
Hey, Popp?

00:19:12.069 --> 00:19:15.644
Popp: It's okay, Maam.
It was nothing.

00:19:15.677 --> 00:19:18.617
You don't have to
feel that way at all.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:24.595
I would... gladly throw my...
life away for you any time.

00:19:24.629 --> 00:19:26.197
Huh?

00:19:26.231 --> 00:19:29.370
Popp: I want to
tell you that...

00:19:29.939 --> 00:19:31.609
I...

00:19:33.012 --> 00:19:34.548
I...

00:19:38.122 --> 00:19:40.259
I think you're the best...

00:19:40.292 --> 00:19:42.363
Companion... ever!

00:19:42.998 --> 00:19:44.467
Popp, I...

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:47.273
See you soon, Maam.

00:19:50.079 --> 00:19:52.049
I promise I'll be back.

00:19:52.083 --> 00:19:54.187
You'll be shocked
by how strong I get.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:55.156
[chuckling]

00:19:55.189 --> 00:19:56.526
Well, careful now,

00:19:56.559 --> 00:19:59.197
if you show up looking like
some muscle-bound gorilla,

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:01.736
then I'll have to pretend
that I don't know you.

00:20:01.769 --> 00:20:05.744
You're already not much
to look at anyway.

00:20:05.777 --> 00:20:07.113
W-What?!

00:20:07.147 --> 00:20:08.249
[laughing]

00:20:08.282 --> 00:20:09.818
Best of luck out there.

00:20:09.852 --> 00:20:13.627
And remember; try not to become
too big and strong, okay?

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:14.828
[teasing laughter]

00:20:17.968 --> 00:20:20.607
Thank you, Popp. Goodbye.

00:20:21.676 --> 00:20:24.214
Popp [thought]:
This is how it should be.

00:20:24.247 --> 00:20:26.351
I can't tell her yet.

00:20:26.384 --> 00:20:31.128
I'm not as brave or
strong as she thinks I am.

00:20:31.161 --> 00:20:33.833
I need to get even stronger!

00:20:35.336 --> 00:20:37.206
Leona: What do you
think will happen?

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.079
Because I think there's
about an eighty-percent

00:20:40.113 --> 00:20:41.783
chance he gets shot down.

00:20:41.816 --> 00:20:44.888
Be honest. You really
are enjoying this.

00:20:47.159 --> 00:20:49.197
What the blazes?

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:52.070
Crocodine: Sovereign
Rock Castle is gone!

00:20:52.103 --> 00:20:53.840
How is this possible?

00:20:53.873 --> 00:20:55.442
Look at these.

00:20:57.547 --> 00:20:59.551
I think the castle has moved!

00:20:59.585 --> 00:21:03.425
So, are you saying that it
sprouted legs and walked away?

00:21:03.458 --> 00:21:05.830
It's not entirely
impossible...

00:21:05.864 --> 00:21:09.872
When you consider King Vearn's
Supercharged Dark Energy.

00:21:11.141 --> 00:21:15.449
Crocodine, you need to inform
Dai and the others of this.

00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:17.420
And what about you?

00:21:17.453 --> 00:21:21.729
I'm going to follow those
giant footprints lead.

00:21:21.762 --> 00:21:24.801
I feel something terrible
is going to happen.

00:21:27.875 --> 00:21:29.477
Captain: So. Where are we?

00:21:29.511 --> 00:21:31.482
Crew member: Almost
at the northernmost land

00:21:31.516 --> 00:21:33.185
known as the Field of Death.

00:21:33.218 --> 00:21:34.721
Smooth sailing, Captain.

00:21:34.755 --> 00:21:35.790
Excellent.

00:21:39.565 --> 00:21:41.434
Captain: What was that?!

00:21:42.003 --> 00:21:43.606
I don't know, captain.

00:21:47.748 --> 00:21:49.852
[screaming]

00:21:54.461 --> 00:21:58.368
It's huge! It's enormous!

00:22:00.039 --> 00:22:02.978
A giant made out
of a mountain!

00:23:37.801 --> 00:23:39.003
Narrator: Seeking
new weapons,

00:23:39.036 --> 00:23:41.441
Dai and his friends
head to Bengarna Kingdom

00:23:41.474 --> 00:23:43.679
to visit a department store.

00:23:44.848 --> 00:23:47.520
And while they browse its
aisles for the first time,

00:23:47.554 --> 00:23:50.126
Dai and Popp are awed
by the establishment's

00:23:50.159 --> 00:23:52.831
unfamiliar snacks and wares.

00:23:52.864 --> 00:23:57.339
But little do they know that
a vicious new threat approaches.

00:23:57.373 --> 00:23:58.843
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:58.876 --> 00:24:01.348
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:01.381 --> 00:24:03.586
"Off to the Department Store".
