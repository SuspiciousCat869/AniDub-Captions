WEBVTT

00:01:53.126 --> 00:01:57.334
[pained groan]

00:01:59.907 --> 00:02:05.919
[gasping]

00:02:05.952 --> 00:02:07.722
L-Lord Hadlar, what's wrong?

00:02:07.756 --> 00:02:10.661
[groaning]

00:02:10.695 --> 00:02:12.331
[chuckle]

00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:15.137
My transformation
into a Superior Being

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.209
was done too
hastily, it seems.

00:02:18.242 --> 00:02:22.351
It's put quite a
strain on my body.

00:02:22.384 --> 00:02:24.956
Should I continue
to fight in this state,

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.194
I'll not last long.

00:02:27.228 --> 00:02:29.198
Albinass: Is defeating
the boy and his friends

00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:30.668
worth all this suffering?

00:02:30.701 --> 00:02:32.304
Hadlar: Of course.

00:02:32.338 --> 00:02:35.177
I would pay with my life.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.148
I want to know.

00:02:37.181 --> 00:02:40.521
I need to know
how powerful I can be

00:02:40.555 --> 00:02:44.896
if I cast every part of me
aside in the name of victory!

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.969
But power alone
is meaningless.

00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:50.240
It seems no matter
how strong I am,

00:02:50.273 --> 00:02:52.578
there's always
someone stronger.

00:02:52.612 --> 00:02:55.685
Dragon Knights,
King Vearn...

00:02:55.718 --> 00:03:00.561
I don't expect I'll ever be able
to surpass their abilities.

00:03:06.372 --> 00:03:10.480
But still, the Disciples
of Avan plague my dreams.

00:03:10.514 --> 00:03:13.654
The swordsman may be no more,

00:03:13.688 --> 00:03:18.463
but his remaining students
continue to threaten my legacy.

00:03:18.496 --> 00:03:21.235
I never really defeated Avan;

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.472
he lives on through them.

00:03:23.507 --> 00:03:28.349
And I will not rest until
they have all been destroyed.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.824
But my lord, if...

00:03:31.857 --> 00:03:33.594
Forgive me.

00:03:33.628 --> 00:03:36.233
You're born of
Forbidden Magic.

00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:38.370
You can't live if I die.

00:03:38.403 --> 00:03:41.409
Hym: It doesn't
matter. We are yours.

00:03:41.442 --> 00:03:45.518
We exist only to
fulfill your ambitions!

00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:49.659
And if it means
sacrificing ourselves...

00:03:50.995 --> 00:03:53.834
It would be our
greatest honor.

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:00.413
Hadlar: Hym... your eyes...

00:04:03.955 --> 00:04:07.227
This doesn't make any sense-
this can't be happening.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.730
I'm no human!

00:04:11.002 --> 00:04:14.308
But, Hym... those are tears!

00:04:17.882 --> 00:04:21.857
Fenbren: I beg you,
Lord Hadlar. Forgive me.

00:04:21.891 --> 00:04:23.426
Fenbren?!

00:04:25.698 --> 00:04:29.104
I see now... No wonder they
call it the "Field of Death."

00:04:29.138 --> 00:04:31.610
We need to hurry
and find Chiu.

00:04:37.187 --> 00:04:38.422
Popp: Chiu!

00:04:39.358 --> 00:04:40.962
Are you okay?

00:04:40.995 --> 00:04:42.899
C'mon. You better be alive.

00:04:43.466 --> 00:04:45.470
Please - wake up.

00:04:48.678 --> 00:04:50.313
Chiu: Oh.

00:04:50.347 --> 00:04:52.752
You're all here
to rescue me...

00:04:52.785 --> 00:04:54.421
What happened?

00:04:55.891 --> 00:05:00.400
I found this for you.
You're welcome.

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:03.406
Chiu: Once I give everyone
the new intel I've gathered,

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.578
you're all gonna
be thanking me.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.851
Popp: All right.
Take it easy.

00:05:11.557 --> 00:05:14.495
You're such an idiot!
Why are you even out here?!

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:16.800
You are never going
to hear the end of this,

00:05:16.833 --> 00:05:20.040
you know - you reckless
little weirdo!

00:05:20.074 --> 00:05:24.182
Does he really think we're the
ones who drove off his attacker?

00:05:24.215 --> 00:05:25.518
Yeah.

00:05:25.551 --> 00:05:28.122
Based on these wounds, I
would guess it was the bishop.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.730
Crocodine: What's wrong?

00:05:35.905 --> 00:05:36.973
Hey, Popp...

00:05:37.007 --> 00:05:39.145
you take Chiu and the
others and get out of here!

00:05:39.178 --> 00:05:41.082
Huh? What's the problem?

00:05:41.115 --> 00:05:44.488
Popp: Even with these extra
guys I can still take everyone.

00:05:45.592 --> 00:05:47.260
Hyunckel: Forget about us.

00:05:47.294 --> 00:05:50.300
Head back to the base
and get them patched up.

00:05:50.334 --> 00:05:51.435
Don't be ridiculous.

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:53.941
The two of
you are strong...

00:05:55.477 --> 00:05:58.082
Please, Popp. Go now.

00:05:59.218 --> 00:06:00.721
All right...

00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:04.896
Popp: Whatever you're
doing, just be careful.

00:06:10.374 --> 00:06:12.912
Care to explain yourself?

00:06:12.945 --> 00:06:16.118
There. Now, come on
out, I know it's you.

00:06:18.456 --> 00:06:20.694
Baran: It's been
a while, you two.

00:06:24.034 --> 00:06:25.403
Crocodine: Baran?!

00:06:27.474 --> 00:06:31.282
I rather thought my presence
would be undetectable.

00:06:31.315 --> 00:06:35.056
I must admit; you've improved.

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:39.866
It was wise to send that Mage
home and out of harm's way.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.172
He once lost his
life because of me.

00:06:43.206 --> 00:06:47.481
If he knew I was here,
he might've lost his nerve.

00:06:47.515 --> 00:06:48.918
Well, then.

00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:52.458
Have you come to settle things
once and for all with Dai?!

00:06:52.491 --> 00:06:54.563
You keep away from him!

00:06:54.596 --> 00:06:56.032
The remaining
kingdoms are about to

00:06:56.065 --> 00:06:59.405
gather all of their forces
and attack the Dark King.

00:06:59.438 --> 00:07:01.776
They need a leader like Dai...

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.317
One that can hold their
own on the battlefield!

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.756
I'm of the same mind, Baran.

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:11.295
That is why I chose
to stay, after all.

00:07:11.329 --> 00:07:12.632
I would risk my life

00:07:12.665 --> 00:07:16.673
to keep a fight like that
from ever happening again.

00:07:16.706 --> 00:07:19.546
You can put whatever
you want on the line,

00:07:19.579 --> 00:07:22.218
but you two cannot defeat me.

00:07:22.251 --> 00:07:23.253
Crocodine: We'll see!

00:07:23.286 --> 00:07:24.556
Now, settle down.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.727
I'm not here to fight you.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.666
And I don't want
to fight Dai, either.

00:07:30.968 --> 00:07:35.911
Baran: My new objective
is the Dark King himself...

00:07:35.944 --> 00:07:37.515
and him alone.

00:07:37.549 --> 00:07:39.753
The Dark King Vearn?

00:07:39.786 --> 00:07:41.422
You're turning against him?!

00:07:41.455 --> 00:07:42.558
So what changed?

00:07:42.592 --> 00:07:44.963
I owe you no explanations.

00:07:44.996 --> 00:07:48.837
He cannot be allowed
to live. That's all.

00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:51.877
Crocodine: Baran, wait.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.050
If this is the truth then
our objectives are aligned!

00:07:55.083 --> 00:07:59.759
Let us finally put the past
to rest... and work together!

00:08:01.429 --> 00:08:04.100
You saved our
friend, didn't you?

00:08:04.134 --> 00:08:09.144
With you by our side, our
forces would be truly fearsome.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.949
Please...

00:08:10.982 --> 00:08:12.518
For Dai!

00:08:13.954 --> 00:08:15.858
Hyunckel: Crocodine
- get away!

00:08:16.659 --> 00:08:20.032
[pained groan]

00:08:21.402 --> 00:08:24.141
It's my task... mine!

00:08:30.087 --> 00:08:31.623
Hyunckel: Crocodine!

00:08:33.894 --> 00:08:35.764
[roaring punch]

00:08:36.199 --> 00:08:41.308
[groaning]

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:48.022
I am the Dragon
Master General.

00:08:50.595 --> 00:08:53.534
You dare insult me?

00:08:53.567 --> 00:08:55.370
Humanity is still
nothing more than

00:08:55.403 --> 00:08:58.409
another enemy
to be disposed of.

00:08:58.442 --> 00:09:01.817
I would rather
perish than help them!

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:05.023
I only saved the rat
because I stumbled upon him

00:09:05.056 --> 00:09:09.264
while searching for an
entrance to Vearn's stronghold.

00:09:09.298 --> 00:09:10.935
Nothing but chance.

00:09:10.968 --> 00:09:14.976
Now, I know the
entrance is underwater.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:19.452
They claim that not even a
Dragon Knight can penetrate it.

00:09:19.485 --> 00:09:21.689
We'll see about that.

00:09:22.525 --> 00:09:24.428
Hyunckel: Wait, Baran...

00:09:24.461 --> 00:09:26.498
Go by yourself
and the enemy will

00:09:26.533 --> 00:09:30.073
focus their entire
strength upon you alone...

00:09:30.106 --> 00:09:31.308
Baran: Let them.

00:09:31.342 --> 00:09:35.450
I will cut down every minion
that Vearn sends my way.

00:09:35.483 --> 00:09:36.920
From here on,

00:09:36.954 --> 00:09:41.095
this battle is between the true
Dragon Knight and the Dark King.

00:09:41.128 --> 00:09:43.466
It will be a fight
beyond your rank.

00:09:43.499 --> 00:09:46.138
Go back if you want to live.

00:09:48.142 --> 00:09:50.046
Return to my son.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.950
Hyunckel [thought]:
Those eyes...

00:09:51.983 --> 00:09:54.956
He's not the same
Baran I once knew.

00:09:54.989 --> 00:09:56.391
Could it be?

00:10:02.806 --> 00:10:05.077
This was our forward base.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:08.249
Now it looks more
like a field hospital.

00:10:08.282 --> 00:10:10.521
There's still time to regroup.

00:10:10.554 --> 00:10:12.591
Chiu and the others are okay.

00:10:12.625 --> 00:10:15.430
They've all been healed.
And they're resting now.

00:10:15.463 --> 00:10:16.900
Dai: That's great!

00:10:16.934 --> 00:10:18.904
I sure hope
Hyunckel and Crocodine

00:10:18.937 --> 00:10:20.975
can still get back safely...

00:10:21.008 --> 00:10:23.813
Amy: Popp, how could
you leave them behind?!

00:10:24.549 --> 00:10:26.987
Well, I...
It's just that...

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.126
he got so weird and
serious all of sudden.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.765
He wouldn't take no
for an answer.

00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:35.737
Dai: What would make
Hyunckel act like that?

00:10:38.678 --> 00:10:39.679
Popp: What's wrong?

00:10:39.712 --> 00:10:41.950
I'm... not sure.

00:10:45.591 --> 00:10:49.231
Hyunckel: Stop. I can't
let you go any further!

00:10:49.966 --> 00:10:52.171
Baran: Don't
test me, Hyunckel.

00:10:52.204 --> 00:10:55.912
I didn't come here
to humiliate you two.

00:10:55.945 --> 00:10:59.752
Oh, I know. But now I
understand what you're after.

00:10:59.786 --> 00:11:02.023
What you plan to do.

00:11:02.056 --> 00:11:05.597
You intend to throw your
life away to protect Dai!

00:11:05.631 --> 00:11:08.135
Not even a Dragon Knight
can emerge from a fight

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:10.641
with an enemy like
Vearn unscathed,

00:11:10.674 --> 00:11:14.248
and you're not expecting
to, either. Are you?

00:11:14.281 --> 00:11:18.790
But I won't allow you to
do this, Baran. You can't.

00:11:18.824 --> 00:11:23.499
It's a hopeless battle,
even if it is for your son!

00:11:23.533 --> 00:11:25.002
Baran: If you care about Dai,

00:11:25.036 --> 00:11:28.409
then wouldn't letting me do
this be better for the boy?

00:11:28.442 --> 00:11:30.012
Why stop me?

00:11:30.046 --> 00:11:33.654
You go alone,
you won't come back.

00:11:33.687 --> 00:11:36.726
I'm not letting that happen!

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.128
You see...

00:11:38.162 --> 00:11:42.337
I leave Master Baran...
and Dino in your hands.

00:11:42.371 --> 00:11:45.476
This Dark Armor Spear
that you see me wield...

00:11:48.918 --> 00:11:52.190
it was given to
me for a reason.

00:11:55.798 --> 00:11:56.900
Baran [thought]: Larhart?

00:11:56.933 --> 00:11:59.905
You would try to
dissuade me from this?

00:12:01.141 --> 00:12:02.745
Just a boy.

00:12:02.779 --> 00:12:06.587
Did you really think I
would obey someone like you?

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.453
Hyunckel: 'Course not.

00:12:08.456 --> 00:12:11.863
Hyunckel: Sadly, my only
choice is to defeat you

00:12:11.896 --> 00:12:15.069
before Hadlar
detects our presence.

00:12:15.103 --> 00:12:16.739
Baran [thought]:
What is that stance?

00:12:16.773 --> 00:12:19.713
To cast aside his weapon
in the face of battle...

00:12:19.746 --> 00:12:22.016
What is he up to?

00:12:27.828 --> 00:12:29.331
His Aura...

00:12:29.365 --> 00:12:31.034
It's gone.

00:12:44.227 --> 00:12:47.835
Baran [thought]: Hyunckel's
Aura has completely vanished...

00:12:47.869 --> 00:12:51.341
He's like a still pond
without a single ripple.

00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:58.055
Are you dropping your
weapon? What's wrong?!

00:12:58.089 --> 00:13:00.827
You don't need
to worry, Crocodine.

00:13:00.861 --> 00:13:02.932
This is a dangerous skill-

00:13:02.965 --> 00:13:06.305
and it seems to me like even
Baran is worried about it.

00:13:06.338 --> 00:13:07.274
Huh?!

00:13:07.307 --> 00:13:08.777
Crocodine [thought]:
I can't sense any Aura

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:10.279
coming off of him.

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:15.524
Baran is quieting
his Aura, as well.

00:13:15.557 --> 00:13:16.993
What's going on?

00:13:17.027 --> 00:13:19.532
Now my Aura is the
strongest one here!

00:13:19.565 --> 00:13:22.237
I see. It's a self-sacrifice.

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:23.840
Self-sacrifice?!

00:13:23.873 --> 00:13:26.779
If either of us
unleashes a powerful attack

00:13:26.813 --> 00:13:28.917
it will create an opening.

00:13:28.951 --> 00:13:30.654
You intend to
exploit that opening

00:13:30.687 --> 00:13:33.292
and strike me with
a counterattack.

00:13:33.326 --> 00:13:35.029
Hardly a revelation.

00:13:35.062 --> 00:13:38.169
Avan's book mentions a
skill I thought beyond me.

00:13:38.202 --> 00:13:40.473
One that I couldn't
possibly learn in time.

00:13:40.508 --> 00:13:41.543
You see...

00:13:41.576 --> 00:13:43.346
Fifteen years ago,

00:13:43.379 --> 00:13:45.984
when Avan fought
the Dark Lord Hadlar,

00:13:46.018 --> 00:13:48.355
he unlocked this ability.

00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:51.830
Avan Style's
Ultimate Technique...

00:13:51.863 --> 00:13:53.633
Hollow Stance!

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:55.402
Hollow Stance?

00:13:55.436 --> 00:13:58.476
Hyunckel: In order to avoid
a fatal blow from an enemy,

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:01.582
one must completely drain
the power of their Aura

00:14:01.616 --> 00:14:03.754
and ride out the
force of the attack.

00:14:03.787 --> 00:14:05.791
Let their attack go
through you.

00:14:05.825 --> 00:14:07.861
It can't be done
with a weapon.

00:14:07.895 --> 00:14:11.737
Or with any desire to
defeat your enemy in combat.

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:13.272
And Avan took that risk.

00:14:13.306 --> 00:14:16.044
When he chose
to lower his sword.

00:14:22.558 --> 00:14:24.294
Avan: Come on, Hadlar!

00:14:24.327 --> 00:14:28.737
What a fool! You've
made a fatal mistake!

00:14:28.771 --> 00:14:32.578
This will be... your doom!

00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:36.687
Avan: Avan...

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.157
Strash!

00:14:42.363 --> 00:14:45.670
Hyunckel: Avan used the
Hollow Stance and Avan Strash.

00:14:45.704 --> 00:14:49.477
By combining the ultimate
passive and active techniques,

00:14:49.512 --> 00:14:51.749
he defeated Hadlar.

00:14:51.783 --> 00:14:56.157
I, on the other hand, always
held my weapon for revenge.

00:14:56.191 --> 00:14:59.899
To cast it aside and force
myself into a hollow state...

00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:03.238
It was absurd to me
to even consider it.

00:15:03.272 --> 00:15:05.377
And yet now it's
the only skill

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:08.383
that might give me
the advantage I need.

00:15:08.416 --> 00:15:09.985
Using the Hollow Stance,

00:15:10.019 --> 00:15:14.662
I'll create an opening
and use a counterattack.

00:15:14.695 --> 00:15:17.601
Crocodine [thought]: I get it.
The stronger the attack,

00:15:17.634 --> 00:15:21.776
the greater the opening
the Hollow Stance creates!

00:15:21.809 --> 00:15:24.347
For someone as
powerful as Baran,

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.621
it must be making
him think twice.

00:15:27.655 --> 00:15:31.630
That explains why he's trying
to get rid of his own aura

00:15:31.663 --> 00:15:33.499
for this fight, as well.

00:15:33.534 --> 00:15:37.140
Baran: You've grown into
a true adversary, Hyunckel.

00:15:38.109 --> 00:15:41.248
I can suppress my
Aura up to a point,

00:15:41.281 --> 00:15:44.421
but I can't erase it
completely, like you.

00:15:44.454 --> 00:15:46.258
That state cannot
be reached without

00:15:46.292 --> 00:15:48.663
the strongest of resolves.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.105
There's Hyunckel.
Who is he fighting?

00:15:54.809 --> 00:15:56.344
Albinass: I know that man...

00:15:59.251 --> 00:16:02.658
But, he - Baran's aura
is getting stronger?!

00:16:04.862 --> 00:16:07.502
Yes. That's your only option.

00:16:07.535 --> 00:16:08.871
You'll have to attack,

00:16:08.904 --> 00:16:11.543
but you must try to
hold yourself back.

00:16:11.576 --> 00:16:16.018
Once you endure my counter,
you'll unleash a second attack.

00:16:16.051 --> 00:16:19.759
That is, if you endure
my counter at all.

00:16:19.792 --> 00:16:22.430
So they're both
risking their lives?!

00:16:22.464 --> 00:16:25.670
Baran: Hyunckel, you've
shown me your resolve.

00:16:26.973 --> 00:16:31.549
I shall face this skill,
just as you wish.

00:16:36.191 --> 00:16:40.032
You ready? Here we go...

00:16:40.066 --> 00:16:42.772
Hyunckel: Larhart, there
isn't a day that goes by

00:16:42.805 --> 00:16:44.909
where I don't think of you.

00:16:44.942 --> 00:16:48.784
This attack will be
the best I can offer.

00:16:48.817 --> 00:16:51.355
Should I fail to stop Baran,

00:16:51.388 --> 00:16:55.196
you can mock my foolish
attempt in the afterlife.

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:58.737
That's Master Baran?
It's really him?!

00:16:58.771 --> 00:17:02.845
A deserter of the Dark Army and
father to the little hero Dai.

00:17:02.878 --> 00:17:04.381
It's only a matter
of time before

00:17:04.414 --> 00:17:06.886
he turns against Lord Hadlar.

00:17:06.919 --> 00:17:08.455
This is perfect.

00:17:08.489 --> 00:17:11.128
We can eliminate
both in one strike.

00:17:11.161 --> 00:17:13.065
Wait a moment, Albinass!

00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:14.669
They may in
fact be our enemies,

00:17:14.702 --> 00:17:18.275
but it's not our place to
interrupt a duel now, is it?

00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:21.248
Who knows how angry it
might make Lord Hadlar?

00:17:21.282 --> 00:17:23.386
I will take full
responsibility.

00:17:23.419 --> 00:17:26.826
Everything...
Is for the Dark Lord.

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:30.834
Destroy his enemies.
Show no mercy!

00:17:34.141 --> 00:17:37.547
[roaring]

00:17:49.872 --> 00:17:51.609
Both: Come on!

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.862
[pained roar]

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:13.686
A-Albinass?

00:18:15.089 --> 00:18:16.525
Did you get them?

00:18:17.226 --> 00:18:18.596
What happened?!

00:18:19.732 --> 00:18:20.734
Your arm...

00:18:21.636 --> 00:18:23.573
No wonder you like him.

00:18:24.608 --> 00:18:25.944
Hyunckel...

00:18:25.978 --> 00:18:28.348
Truly a mighty warrior...

00:18:28.816 --> 00:18:30.152
Hym: Albinass!

00:18:30.821 --> 00:18:32.858
He's no longer a threat.

00:18:32.891 --> 00:18:35.563
That is the one silver lining.

00:18:38.637 --> 00:18:41.074
Crocodine: I should
thank you, Baran.

00:18:41.107 --> 00:18:43.713
Though I sense
there's more to come.

00:18:44.982 --> 00:18:47.153
But, wait - Hyunckel.

00:18:47.921 --> 00:18:49.490
Where's Hyunckel?!

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.794
Hyunckel! No, no!

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:10.499
It's too late.

00:19:10.533 --> 00:19:13.574
Baran: He lives, but
he'll never fight again.

00:19:13.607 --> 00:19:14.609
But how?

00:19:14.642 --> 00:19:16.813
What in the world
could have possibly done

00:19:16.846 --> 00:19:19.251
this kind of damage to him?!

00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:21.087
It was an ambush.

00:19:21.121 --> 00:19:24.161
It seems Hadlar's
soldiers interrupted us...

00:19:24.194 --> 00:19:26.198
and he was wide open.

00:19:26.231 --> 00:19:28.837
Baran: All of my
focus was on Hyunckel.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:31.676
Everything I had was
going into that attack.

00:19:31.709 --> 00:19:35.182
The two of us were so intent
on destroying each other-

00:19:35.215 --> 00:19:36.853
we were exposed.

00:19:36.886 --> 00:19:38.523
But Hyunckel noticed...

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:40.960
Needle Thousand!

00:19:44.034 --> 00:19:45.670
Hyunckel: Bloody Scryde!

00:19:50.847 --> 00:19:52.918
Baran: His Hollow
Stance absorbed the blow

00:19:52.952 --> 00:19:54.588
that was meant
for both of us-

00:19:54.622 --> 00:19:56.792
and he countered
their sneak attack.

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:04.742
Even though it meant that he
had to take my attack directly.

00:20:04.775 --> 00:20:07.614
His words weren't
just empty platitudes.

00:20:07.647 --> 00:20:11.856
He saved my life.
By putting his own on the line.

00:20:14.194 --> 00:20:15.764
Crocodine: Hyunckel...

00:20:16.765 --> 00:20:18.402
So, Crocodine...

00:20:18.435 --> 00:20:21.274
What would you
do in my position?

00:20:21.307 --> 00:20:24.882
Is there a way to somehow
repay this sacrifice?

00:20:24.916 --> 00:20:27.486
Don't ask me, Baran.

00:20:27.521 --> 00:20:30.961
I'm ashamed to admit
it, but deep down,

00:20:30.994 --> 00:20:33.465
I wanted you to
fight King Vearn.

00:20:33.499 --> 00:20:37.407
I thought it would
benefit the humans!

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.212
Getting in your way
would be futile, I thought-

00:20:40.246 --> 00:20:43.419
I was ready to stand down.

00:20:43.452 --> 00:20:46.424
And yet...
And yet, Hyunckel...

00:20:48.095 --> 00:20:49.999
There's nothing I can say.

00:20:50.032 --> 00:20:51.468
He can be cold,

00:20:51.503 --> 00:20:55.644
but he's a human that
I'm proud to call my friend!

00:20:55.677 --> 00:20:59.751
Please, let us honor
the decision he has made.

00:21:04.093 --> 00:21:05.663
Baran: I see.

00:21:07.199 --> 00:21:09.304
Leona: The Dark
Citadel, Vearn Palace.

00:21:09.337 --> 00:21:12.778
So, the Citadel Gate
is underwater, is it? Huh.

00:21:12.812 --> 00:21:15.751
That's Chiu. Always a
surprise with that one.

00:21:15.784 --> 00:21:19.958
I think I...
I need to destroy the gate.

00:21:19.992 --> 00:21:21.461
While everyone
else is fighting

00:21:21.495 --> 00:21:24.033
Hadlar's Royal Guard
on the surface.

00:21:24.067 --> 00:21:25.603
Leona: Wait a minute, Dai.

00:21:25.637 --> 00:21:27.575
Even a Dragon Knight
isn't going to

00:21:27.608 --> 00:21:29.444
take that gate down easily.

00:21:29.478 --> 00:21:32.416
It's far too risky
for you to go alone.

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:34.788
You need someone to
come with you.

00:21:35.823 --> 00:21:39.364
I can go. Leave
it to me and Dai.

00:21:39.397 --> 00:21:42.738
But you're our key player
against the Royal Guard!

00:21:42.771 --> 00:21:44.508
I'll go instead.

00:21:48.282 --> 00:21:50.687
Baran: No, I will.

00:21:52.691 --> 00:21:54.728
[trembling]

00:21:54.761 --> 00:21:56.064
Popp: Baran?!

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.072
Narrator: Baran's
appearance has everyone wary,

00:23:40.105 --> 00:23:42.410
but Dai agrees to
collaborate with his father

00:23:42.443 --> 00:23:45.382
in order to infiltrate
Vearn's Citadel.

00:23:45.416 --> 00:23:47.186
With much on their minds,

00:23:47.219 --> 00:23:48.690
the pair split
off from the group

00:23:48.723 --> 00:23:51.995
and head for the
Dark Army's stronghold.

00:23:52.029 --> 00:23:55.002
But what will they find waiting
for them when they arrive?

00:23:56.238 --> 00:23:57.508
Find out next time on

00:23:57.541 --> 00:23:59.878
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:23:59.911 --> 00:24:02.984
"Father and Son
Dragons Set Out".
