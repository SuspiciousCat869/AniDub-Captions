WEBVTT

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:52.124
-Hyunckel: Popp!
-[struggling grunts]

00:01:52.157 --> 00:01:54.061
Borahorn: Drop your weapon.

00:01:54.095 --> 00:01:58.003
Otherwise, he's the one
who'll lose his head.

00:01:58.036 --> 00:01:59.338
You scoundrel...

00:02:00.608 --> 00:02:03.013
[pained groan]

00:02:03.046 --> 00:02:04.415
Better hurry up.

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:07.121
Hyunckel: If I
do what you say and

00:02:07.154 --> 00:02:11.362
accept defeat, will you
really let him go?

00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:16.707
I have no interest in this
pitiful insect's life.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.750
All I want to see is
your head on a platter!

00:02:21.783 --> 00:02:24.355
Borahorn: So what will it be?

00:02:26.693 --> 00:02:27.863
Very well, then.

00:02:27.896 --> 00:02:29.198
Popp: Wait!

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.574
Don't quit, Hyunckel.
Just forget about me.

00:02:33.607 --> 00:02:36.012
Borahorn: Shut up!

00:02:36.046 --> 00:02:38.651
C'mon. Just kill him now!

00:02:38.684 --> 00:02:40.020
I cannot do that.

00:02:40.053 --> 00:02:42.058
Popp: Of course you can!

00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:44.796
I'm all out of Magic Power.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.238
Between me and you,
it's obvious who can help Dai!

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.209
Hyunckel: Popp!

00:02:51.243 --> 00:02:53.614
Besides all that-
we both know someone

00:02:53.647 --> 00:02:57.220
who'll be miserable
if you don't make it back.

00:02:57.889 --> 00:02:59.324
Hyunckel [thought]: Maam...

00:02:59.358 --> 00:03:03.467
Popp: Her tears are the last
thing I ever what to see...

00:03:03.501 --> 00:03:06.305
I beg you, you have to live.

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:08.944
That way you can go on...

00:03:08.978 --> 00:03:11.717
and make her happy.

00:03:11.751 --> 00:03:14.756
Look, Popp - I can't
make anyone happy.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.227
All I bring is misfortune.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.332
It's my curse.

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:23.306
A curse that I plan to
use against those who do evil.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.214
That's why I'm here...
Why I joined your party.

00:03:28.183 --> 00:03:30.321
And so when I see him again,

00:03:30.354 --> 00:03:32.926
Avan will have one
less reason to scold me

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.530
for all that I've done.

00:03:34.563 --> 00:03:37.969
If he hears that I
abandoned a junior disciple,

00:03:38.002 --> 00:03:39.906
I'll be lectured for eternity.

00:03:41.142 --> 00:03:42.578
Hyunckel...

00:03:43.346 --> 00:03:45.217
[menacing chuckle]

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.254
That's the attitude...

00:03:47.288 --> 00:03:49.526
Now hold still, tough guy.

00:03:50.494 --> 00:03:53.399
No, don't. Please, don't!

00:03:57.141 --> 00:03:58.877
Die!

00:03:59.546 --> 00:04:01.315
Hyunckel!

00:04:07.027 --> 00:04:08.997
[weakened groan]

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:16.947
Hyunckel: Larhart...

00:04:25.063 --> 00:04:27.267
Why did you do
that to your friend?

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:29.573
Larhart: To use
a hostage like that

00:04:29.606 --> 00:04:32.545
would bring shame
to the Dragon Masters.

00:04:32.578 --> 00:04:37.087
It's unforgivable...
And against a human no less.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.061
What is it that's made you
despise humanity so deeply?

00:04:42.097 --> 00:04:44.301
Much like Master Dino,

00:04:44.335 --> 00:04:47.709
I was born to parents
of different species.

00:04:47.742 --> 00:04:52.284
For me, it was a
Darkling and a human.

00:04:52.318 --> 00:04:54.489
Larhart: My Darkling
father died early,

00:04:54.523 --> 00:04:57.728
and so I was raised
by my human mother.

00:04:57.762 --> 00:05:01.168
But then, when I
was seven years old,

00:05:01.202 --> 00:05:03.373
war broke out
between Lord Hadlar

00:05:03.406 --> 00:05:05.744
and all of the human nations.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.022
Just because of
my Darkling lineage,

00:05:11.055 --> 00:05:14.294
the humans thought
themselves better than me...

00:05:14.328 --> 00:05:18.670
And not just me, but my
human mother, as well.

00:05:25.685 --> 00:05:29.993
Eventually, she fell
ill and passed away.

00:05:30.026 --> 00:05:33.099
Forsaken by her own people.

00:05:44.455 --> 00:05:47.428
Larhart: Master Baran
was the only one...

00:05:47.461 --> 00:05:49.966
who ever understood my pain.

00:05:54.743 --> 00:05:58.115
[sniffling]

00:06:00.588 --> 00:06:02.625
You two are so soft.

00:06:02.658 --> 00:06:05.998
You actually feel my pain
as if it were your own.

00:06:06.031 --> 00:06:10.574
I must admit, I've never
met humans like you.

00:06:10.607 --> 00:06:12.612
Maybe you'll be
able to understand

00:06:12.645 --> 00:06:17.054
Master Baran's pain as
well as you do mine.

00:06:17.088 --> 00:06:18.957
I leave his fate...

00:06:18.991 --> 00:06:20.928
and Dino's, in your hands.

00:06:20.962 --> 00:06:22.331
Larhart...

00:06:22.364 --> 00:06:26.071
Larhart: Hyunckel,
I have one more request.

00:06:27.307 --> 00:06:28.510
Hyunckel: Name it.

00:06:29.946 --> 00:06:35.390
Would you please accept my...
my Dark Armour Spear?

00:06:35.423 --> 00:06:37.595
Larhart: I want you to use it.

00:07:13.634 --> 00:07:18.443
The armor favors you, as well.
I knew that it would.

00:07:18.476 --> 00:07:20.581
It may have been in battle...

00:07:20.614 --> 00:07:26.126
but I'm glad to have met
men like you... even at...

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:29.732
the... the very... end.

00:07:38.517 --> 00:07:42.158
Hyunckel [thought]: Larhart,
I shall accept your will

00:07:42.191 --> 00:07:44.261
as well this armor...

00:07:44.294 --> 00:07:47.768
in which your spirit resides.

00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:52.712
Leona: It feels
like we're doomed.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.252
Do you have a plan, Crocodine?

00:07:56.285 --> 00:07:59.660
I was hoping that you had one.

00:07:59.693 --> 00:08:01.930
If only Hyunckel were here.

00:08:01.963 --> 00:08:05.771
Then we might have at
least had options, but...

00:08:07.842 --> 00:08:09.244
Baran!

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.701
All right. Hand over Dino.

00:08:20.735 --> 00:08:21.537
No!

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:22.872
Baran: [amused chuckle]

00:08:22.905 --> 00:08:25.878
Do you really think that you
can stop me by yourselves?

00:08:25.912 --> 00:08:30.320
How interesting. I hope you
have a very good plan.

00:08:30.353 --> 00:08:33.026
Crocodine [thought]: Of course
we won't stop him alone.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:35.965
There's no way we
can match his strength.

00:08:35.998 --> 00:08:41.810
If only... If only we
had one more on our side!

00:08:41.844 --> 00:08:45.416
Baran: Also... speaking
of ill-advised plans...

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:46.819
That Mage.

00:08:46.853 --> 00:08:50.193
It seems like he didn't even
think his strategy through.

00:08:50.226 --> 00:08:51.764
So I left him...

00:08:51.797 --> 00:08:53.601
To the Dragon Masters.

00:08:53.634 --> 00:08:54.770
He means...

00:08:54.803 --> 00:08:55.672
P-Popp?!

00:08:55.705 --> 00:08:57.842
Baran: I'm rather surprised.

00:08:57.875 --> 00:08:59.478
To sacrifice such a weakling

00:08:59.512 --> 00:09:02.652
was unusually
cruel of you, Crocodine.

00:09:02.685 --> 00:09:07.194
Or, perhaps... it was
actually the girl's idea?

00:09:07.227 --> 00:09:09.131
No, but... How could he?

00:09:09.164 --> 00:09:14.341
Oh, Popp. You went to stop
Baran's forces all alone?

00:09:14.375 --> 00:09:17.080
You pretended
to abandon us...

00:09:17.114 --> 00:09:21.355
And chose to be hated,
all for Dai.

00:09:23.326 --> 00:09:24.328
Leona: When he left...

00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:27.267
I hit him. I actually hit him.

00:09:28.236 --> 00:09:37.622
Crocodine: [laughing]

00:09:37.655 --> 00:09:39.559
Crocodine [thought]:
I've been such a fool.

00:09:39.593 --> 00:09:42.599
I couldn't see how
truly determined you were

00:09:42.632 --> 00:09:45.003
and called you a coward.

00:09:45.036 --> 00:09:46.873
Forgive me, Popp.

00:09:46.907 --> 00:09:51.448
I can only try and make it
up to you - in the afterlife.

00:09:51.481 --> 00:09:53.653
Have you lost your
mind, Crocodine?

00:09:53.687 --> 00:09:56.258
I have had my eyes opened.

00:09:58.196 --> 00:10:00.466
Now, come fight me!

00:10:00.499 --> 00:10:03.707
Baran: Spoken like
a true madman.

00:10:03.741 --> 00:10:08.382
I think I now have a plan...
but I'll need your help.

00:10:10.788 --> 00:10:13.225
But, you... you can't!

00:10:20.574 --> 00:10:22.010
You'll know what to do.

00:10:24.315 --> 00:10:26.819
[roaring]

00:10:30.259 --> 00:10:32.765
Draconic Aura!

00:10:39.411 --> 00:10:41.048
Baran [thought]:
Unbelievable...

00:10:41.082 --> 00:10:44.989
He blocked an attack imbued
with my Draconic Aura.

00:10:46.526 --> 00:10:50.133
Hey, Baran; try using
your Gigabreak.

00:10:50.167 --> 00:10:50.901
Excuse me?

00:10:50.934 --> 00:10:53.372
My hide is tougher than steel.

00:10:53.406 --> 00:10:59.084
Only your strongest attack
could take my life, so use it.

00:10:59.686 --> 00:11:01.154
Baran: Well said.

00:11:09.438 --> 00:11:11.041
I shall grant your wish.

00:11:11.075 --> 00:11:14.682
Take this-
my Ultimate Blade!

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:23.700
Crocodine appears to be proving
quite stubborn out there.

00:11:23.734 --> 00:11:25.504
Hadlar [thought]:
Hopefully stubborn enough

00:11:25.537 --> 00:11:27.307
to defeat Baran...

00:11:28.677 --> 00:11:31.983
Although I doubt
he'll go down easily.

00:11:36.359 --> 00:11:38.429
[growling]

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:41.168
Gigabreak!

00:11:58.704 --> 00:12:01.475
Baran: Thus ends
the Beast King.

00:12:04.649 --> 00:12:05.818
What's she doing?!

00:12:05.851 --> 00:12:07.789
Much obliged, Princess.

00:12:07.822 --> 00:12:09.960
Now I can once again fight.

00:12:09.993 --> 00:12:12.164
Not so fast - it needs time.

00:12:12.197 --> 00:12:14.368
My Fullheal can't
restore both your wounds

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:16.038
and your stamina all at once.

00:12:16.071 --> 00:12:18.643
He shouldn't have
any stamina left.

00:12:18.677 --> 00:12:20.882
I hit him with
my Gigabreak attack-

00:12:20.915 --> 00:12:23.486
even the Beast King
can't survive that!

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.795
All I need - is to
focus my energy into defense.

00:12:27.828 --> 00:12:29.899
So long as I still breathe,

00:12:29.932 --> 00:12:31.636
the Princess is
able to replenish

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.441
my stamina with
her Fullheal!

00:12:34.474 --> 00:12:36.913
Hit me as much as you like.

00:12:36.946 --> 00:12:39.786
My life force or your power...

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.827
It's a contest to
see which will last!

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:47.233
A contest?
You dare mock me...

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:51.408
You dark mock the power
of the Dragon Knight?!

00:12:54.414 --> 00:12:56.553
You must have hurt his pride-

00:12:56.586 --> 00:12:59.358
by not dying after
a single blow!

00:12:59.391 --> 00:13:01.462
His aura is overwhelming...

00:13:01.495 --> 00:13:04.034
Crocodine, this is insanity!

00:13:04.068 --> 00:13:05.403
He's not going to give up,

00:13:05.436 --> 00:13:08.108
and you can't keep
on fighting like this!

00:13:08.142 --> 00:13:10.313
I'm well aware it's crazy.

00:13:10.346 --> 00:13:15.958
But I have no choice because
it's the only way to stop Baran.

00:13:15.991 --> 00:13:19.397
Let us follow in
Popp's spirit, Princess!

00:13:20.835 --> 00:13:23.773
I suppose it's punishment
for doubting him.

00:13:23.807 --> 00:13:26.847
[roaring]

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.554
[pained cry]

00:13:30.587 --> 00:13:32.057
What's wrong, Dai?

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:34.227
Dai: I feel like I'm burning.

00:13:34.261 --> 00:13:39.872
It's like... Like I
can't sit still!

00:13:43.947 --> 00:13:45.383
I hear him...

00:13:47.888 --> 00:13:50.226
Dai: Someone is calling me.

00:13:51.729 --> 00:13:53.465
I have to go.

00:14:07.729 --> 00:14:09.297
Crocodine!

00:14:15.744 --> 00:14:17.347
Baran: Are you immortal?

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:20.453
No one has ever been
hit by my Gigabreak twice

00:14:20.486 --> 00:14:22.223
and managed to survive.

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:29.071
Crocodine: Immortality
is Hyunckel's thing.

00:14:29.104 --> 00:14:31.543
If I keep getting hit
by such a fearsome attack,

00:14:31.576 --> 00:14:33.547
I'm certain I'll perish.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.655
But if taking my life
drains you of your power,

00:14:37.689 --> 00:14:39.658
then it's not a bad trade.

00:14:39.692 --> 00:14:43.767
You mean... You're not trying
to win this fight at all?!

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.238
You would throw
everything away...

00:14:46.271 --> 00:14:49.344
just to see me spend
the rest of my stamina

00:14:49.378 --> 00:14:51.081
and magical energy?

00:14:52.384 --> 00:14:53.286
But why?!

00:14:53.319 --> 00:14:56.224
You are Crocodine,
the mighty Beast King.

00:14:56.258 --> 00:14:59.532
Are you really willing
to sacrifice everything?

00:14:59.566 --> 00:15:02.905
Crocodine: I'm afraid
it's the best I can do.

00:15:02.939 --> 00:15:05.042
If you have nothing left,

00:15:05.075 --> 00:15:08.917
it'll help my friends
when they fight you later.

00:15:08.951 --> 00:15:11.823
Your friends?
No one's coming.

00:15:11.856 --> 00:15:13.727
Crocodine: They will...

00:15:13.761 --> 00:15:15.764
I'm sure.

00:15:15.797 --> 00:15:19.338
Baran [thought]: How can he
trust the humans so much?

00:15:19.371 --> 00:15:22.310
And that spirit is
making him stronger...

00:15:22.343 --> 00:15:25.149
Even with the full
power of my Crest,

00:15:25.182 --> 00:15:28.155
I can't crush him like before.

00:15:30.026 --> 00:15:31.729
Leona [thought]:
He needs a Fullheal!

00:15:34.736 --> 00:15:36.038
Leona: A Zapple spell?!

00:15:36.072 --> 00:15:37.908
That was a warning.

00:15:37.942 --> 00:15:41.015
Take one more step
and I'll turn you to ash.

00:15:41.048 --> 00:15:46.224
I'm done with this ridiculous
game of cat and mouse.

00:15:46.258 --> 00:15:49.532
This time, I will end
it for good.

00:15:59.017 --> 00:16:02.323
[roaring]

00:16:02.356 --> 00:16:03.726
Leona: No. Stop!

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.662
Stay back.

00:16:04.696 --> 00:16:06.867
It's too late-
I warned you!

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:10.874
Zapple!

00:16:10.908 --> 00:16:12.578
Crocodine: Princess!

00:16:17.521 --> 00:16:18.455
What?!

00:16:22.097 --> 00:16:24.068
Larhart's Dark Spear?

00:16:24.101 --> 00:16:26.037
Why would he interfere?

00:16:27.139 --> 00:16:29.411
What's the meaning
of this Larhart?

00:16:29.444 --> 00:16:30.580
[gasp]

00:16:34.521 --> 00:16:35.924
Baran: Hyunckel?

00:16:35.957 --> 00:16:37.260
And Popp, too!

00:16:37.293 --> 00:16:39.999
Well, well, young man.
You survived.

00:16:40.032 --> 00:16:41.101
[proud chuckle]

00:16:41.134 --> 00:16:43.005
Yeah, just barely.

00:16:43.039 --> 00:16:45.810
But still, together
we were able to

00:16:45.844 --> 00:16:48.015
take down those
Dragon Masters.

00:16:48.048 --> 00:16:51.054
Not a chance.
You're speaking lies.

00:16:51.088 --> 00:16:52.758
Hyunckel: It's not a lie.

00:16:52.792 --> 00:16:54.060
They were defeated.

00:16:54.094 --> 00:16:57.233
How else would the two
of us be standing here?

00:16:58.469 --> 00:16:59.605
Now, I see.

00:16:59.638 --> 00:17:04.314
You killed Larhart and took
his armor like a vulture.

00:17:04.916 --> 00:17:06.018
Not quite.

00:17:06.052 --> 00:17:07.287
As a matter of fact,

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:10.761
Larhart gave me this armor
of his own free will.

00:17:10.794 --> 00:17:11.763
Baran: What?!

00:17:11.796 --> 00:17:12.965
Before he passed,

00:17:12.999 --> 00:17:16.238
he asked that I do my
best to save you, Baran.

00:17:16.271 --> 00:17:18.544
Hyunckel: The armor
was his final gift.

00:17:18.577 --> 00:17:21.749
A gift that I plan
on wearing with pride.

00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:23.687
It's not true!

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.722
I know Larhart-

00:17:24.756 --> 00:17:28.028
and he would never
reveal himself to a human!

00:17:28.061 --> 00:17:32.538
Hyunckel: Baran, Larhart
told me your tragic story.

00:17:32.571 --> 00:17:37.047
What happened to Soala, the
princess of Alkeed Kingdom...

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.085
Your wife, the mother
of your child.

00:17:40.119 --> 00:17:44.695
And the day you turned
your back on humanity.

00:17:44.728 --> 00:17:48.971
Hyunckel: I understand your
anger and grief all too well...

00:17:49.004 --> 00:17:51.509
But not all humans are evil.

00:17:51.542 --> 00:17:54.480
You should know that
better than anyone else!

00:17:55.818 --> 00:18:00.493
Because she, the woman that
you loved so very much,

00:18:00.527 --> 00:18:02.531
was herself human!

00:18:04.101 --> 00:18:06.505
Hyunckel: You witnessed
the most beautiful and

00:18:06.539 --> 00:18:10.947
ugly sides of our
species at the same time.

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.918
The weight of
it was unbearable,

00:18:12.951 --> 00:18:16.826
so you hoped to erase all
of humanity from your sight.

00:18:17.662 --> 00:18:20.500
But you're mistaken.

00:18:20.534 --> 00:18:25.310
Doing that won't erase the grief
you feel from losing Soala.

00:18:25.343 --> 00:18:29.251
If you truly call
yourself Dai's father...

00:18:29.284 --> 00:18:32.390
If you truly
love your son...

00:18:32.423 --> 00:18:35.296
Then Baran, shouldn't
you reach out to him

00:18:35.329 --> 00:18:37.366
with your human heart?

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:41.976
I'm sure that's what Dai's
mother would want as well.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.815
Baran, listen to Hyunckel.

00:18:44.849 --> 00:18:45.850
Come on...

00:18:56.204 --> 00:18:58.811
Leona [thought]: What
is this unnatural pressure

00:18:58.844 --> 00:19:00.847
that he's giving off?

00:19:00.881 --> 00:19:03.051
Baran: Then I
cast it aside...

00:19:03.085 --> 00:19:07.027
This human heart and body!

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:07.828
[gasp]

00:19:07.861 --> 00:19:08.930
[alarmed breaths]

00:19:09.965 --> 00:19:12.136
Baran: None of
your pandering nonsense

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:14.676
will bring back my Soala!

00:19:14.709 --> 00:19:16.512
All that drives me now

00:19:16.546 --> 00:19:20.386
is to destroy the humans
together with my son.

00:19:21.021 --> 00:19:23.626
It's all I live for.

00:19:24.361 --> 00:19:26.332
And if I can't have that,

00:19:26.365 --> 00:19:29.671
then I would rather
be destroyed myself!

00:19:30.774 --> 00:19:34.681
Something very weird's
going on. But what?

00:19:36.586 --> 00:19:40.192
Baran [thought]: I will reclaim
Dino by force if I must...

00:19:40.226 --> 00:19:45.069
Even if I have to become
a Demon Beast to do it!

00:19:45.103 --> 00:19:48.209
Look! But that's
impossible...

00:19:48.242 --> 00:19:50.212
Hyunckel: His red
blood is turning into

00:19:50.245 --> 00:19:52.450
the Blue Blood
of the Darklings!

00:19:52.952 --> 00:19:53.953
What the?!

00:19:53.987 --> 00:19:54.822
But, how?!

00:19:54.856 --> 00:19:59.598
[roaring]

00:20:05.711 --> 00:20:06.780
What just happened?

00:20:06.813 --> 00:20:09.552
Heyedra: Report.
All Heyedras stationed in

00:20:09.585 --> 00:20:11.990
the Teran Kingdom
are disappearing.

00:20:12.023 --> 00:20:16.198
Heyedra: Explosive energy is
spreading across the country.

00:20:16.231 --> 00:20:19.037
That's absurd!
How could that be?

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:20.840
There's only
one explanation.

00:20:20.874 --> 00:20:25.651
Baran must be transforming
into his ultimate incarnation.

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:28.089
Zaboera: Send all
Heyedra left in the area

00:20:28.122 --> 00:20:28.857
to Teran Castle! Now!

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:29.925
Heyedra: Yes, master.

00:20:37.708 --> 00:20:45.657
[powerful roaring]

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:49.197
Uh, guys? W-What's
happening to him?

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:50.232
Baran's body...

00:20:50.266 --> 00:20:51.635
Hyunckel &amp; Crocodine:
Is changing!

00:21:12.645 --> 00:21:17.654
[snarling]

00:21:24.067 --> 00:21:28.042
[terrifying roar]

00:21:28.075 --> 00:21:29.778
[trembling]

00:21:30.714 --> 00:21:31.782
[gasp]

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:33.920
[troubled breath]

00:21:34.955 --> 00:21:36.391
[shocked gasp]

00:21:42.605 --> 00:21:46.245
Is this... C-Could
this actually be...

00:21:46.278 --> 00:21:48.081
a Dragon Knight's true form?

00:21:48.114 --> 00:21:50.520
Baran: Indeed.

00:21:50.553 --> 00:21:54.962
The combined power of Dragons,
Darklings, and humans.

00:21:54.996 --> 00:21:59.170
The Ultimate Combat Form
of the Dragon Knight...

00:21:59.203 --> 00:22:03.345
A form known as the Dragonoid.

00:23:37.835 --> 00:23:41.776
Narrator: Baran's Dragonoid
power is beyond this world.

00:23:41.809 --> 00:23:44.682
Even Hyunckel and
Crocodine's combined effort

00:23:44.715 --> 00:23:46.752
proves to be no match.

00:23:46.786 --> 00:23:48.889
Soon, the Dragon
Knight threatens

00:23:48.923 --> 00:23:52.163
to turn Dai against
his friends...

00:23:52.196 --> 00:23:56.739
But just when all seems lost,
Popp devises one last stand.

00:23:56.773 --> 00:23:58.510
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:58.543 --> 00:24:01.114
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:01.147 --> 00:24:02.951
"Popp's Resolve".
