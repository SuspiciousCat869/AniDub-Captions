WEBVTT

00:01:50.955 --> 00:01:52.559
Amy: You're looking
much better.

00:01:52.593 --> 00:01:53.393
Yes.

00:01:53.426 --> 00:01:55.397
Amy: Can I get you anything?

00:01:55.932 --> 00:01:57.636
No need.

00:01:57.669 --> 00:02:00.307
I'll bring you
two some fresh fruit.

00:02:00.341 --> 00:02:02.444
Oh - thank you, Lady Amy!

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:07.187
Popp: Hey.

00:02:08.056 --> 00:02:10.094
The leaders just
finished their meeting.

00:02:10.127 --> 00:02:12.097
The showdown's in five days.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.801
[pained groan]

00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:16.072
Hyunckel: So, they made
up their minds. Huh?

00:02:16.105 --> 00:02:18.309
It's a collaborative
effort between countries,

00:02:18.343 --> 00:02:20.380
so it took a bit
of discussion.

00:02:20.414 --> 00:02:22.218
We'll be gathering
in the Carl Kingdom,

00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:24.188
south of the Field of Death.

00:02:24.222 --> 00:02:26.594
You know the Carl
Kingdom is in ruins.

00:02:26.627 --> 00:02:30.000
And those very ruins will be
used as a cover to build a base.

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:31.236
Popp: Our group will be

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.373
heading out the day
before the attack begins.

00:02:33.407 --> 00:02:35.845
So for the next four days,

00:02:35.878 --> 00:02:38.216
I'm going to
my mentor's place.

00:02:39.051 --> 00:02:40.320
Popp: It's not just me.

00:02:40.354 --> 00:02:42.224
In fact, Maam,
and Crocodine...

00:02:42.258 --> 00:02:45.130
And even Chiu are all
going to be training.

00:02:45.163 --> 00:02:47.468
So, you guys just
make sure to rest up.

00:02:47.502 --> 00:02:49.839
Yeah. I need to go
get prepared, as well.

00:02:50.708 --> 00:02:51.978
Hyunckel: Dai.

00:02:52.011 --> 00:02:53.547
Are you all healed up?

00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:54.482
Dai: Yeah.

00:02:54.516 --> 00:02:56.720
Then we have somewhere
to go, right now.

00:03:04.803 --> 00:03:05.738
Hyunckel...

00:03:06.607 --> 00:03:07.441
Where did...

00:03:07.475 --> 00:03:09.378
Apollo: They've all gone.

00:03:09.412 --> 00:03:09.946
Huh?

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.282
The showdown's set,

00:03:11.315 --> 00:03:14.055
so the Disciples of
Avan all left to train.

00:03:14.088 --> 00:03:16.794
Including Dai, and Hyunckel.

00:03:16.827 --> 00:03:17.662
Amy: But...

00:03:19.364 --> 00:03:20.400
His wounds...

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:22.538
They haven't fully
healed quite yet.

00:03:23.306 --> 00:03:24.776
Why does he need to rush into

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.615
another dangerous
battle, so quickly?

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.459
He only rests when he's too
wounded to do anything else.

00:03:33.493 --> 00:03:36.900
It's like he's cursed to keep
fighting, no matter what.

00:03:38.871 --> 00:03:42.612
They're the only ones
who can save the world, Amy.

00:03:42.645 --> 00:03:43.781
I know.

00:03:43.815 --> 00:03:46.353
Our job right now
is to support them,

00:03:46.386 --> 00:03:49.191
and do what we can
to ease their burden.

00:03:49.224 --> 00:03:51.196
Marin: That means
Hyunckel, too.

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.963
What?

00:03:51.997 --> 00:03:53.767
[laughing]

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.611
The thing is...

00:03:58.644 --> 00:04:02.719
my weapons can recover from this
sort of damage on their own.

00:04:02.752 --> 00:04:06.560
But I can fix them
if you're in a hurry.

00:04:06.593 --> 00:04:09.132
Seems like he's in a
bad mood or something.

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:10.502
Yeah, it's
probably your fault.

00:04:10.535 --> 00:04:12.939
My fault? Why's that?

00:04:12.972 --> 00:04:13.740
Lon: You two.

00:04:14.843 --> 00:04:16.513
Time for a lesson.

00:04:16.547 --> 00:04:18.851
If you think the
Orichalcum is why you lost...

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:21.322
And not because you
were actually beaten

00:04:21.356 --> 00:04:23.126
in evenly matched combat?

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:25.330
I'll straighten you both out.

00:04:25.363 --> 00:04:27.568
Yep. I guess it was my fault.

00:04:29.204 --> 00:04:30.340
Lon: Step outside.

00:04:30.374 --> 00:04:32.845
Huh?! You're gonna
use an actual sword?

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:36.218
Hyunckel [thought]: I didn't
think he knew how to fight.

00:04:36.252 --> 00:04:38.223
Lon: I said I'd
teach you a lesson.

00:04:38.256 --> 00:04:41.395
That sword is this
world's greatest.

00:04:41.428 --> 00:04:44.068
I can't make one
better... And so;

00:04:44.101 --> 00:04:46.807
The only way you're going
to win this next battle...

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.011
Is if you get stronger!

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:00.033
Lon: C'mon.

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:03.607
What hope do you have if you
can't beat a mere blacksmith?

00:05:03.641 --> 00:05:07.649
Dai [thought]: This is
no joke... He's strong!

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:10.287
Hyunckel [thought]:
"A mere blacksmith," huh?

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.490
There's more to this story.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.030
What a shame.

00:05:15.063 --> 00:05:19.439
Lon: It seems those weapons
will go to waste in your hands.

00:05:19.472 --> 00:05:21.075
Once they've been restored,

00:05:21.108 --> 00:05:25.083
I'll show you how to
really wield their power...

00:05:25.117 --> 00:05:27.087
How to really fight!

00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:31.630
Crocodine: That's
the Valge Whirlpool.

00:05:31.663 --> 00:05:33.934
I'm sorry, Chiu. Look sharp.

00:05:33.968 --> 00:05:36.205
I'm going to need
some help with this.

00:05:36.239 --> 00:05:39.044
No problem. Glad to help!

00:05:45.725 --> 00:05:46.893
Okay.

00:05:48.263 --> 00:05:51.335
Matoriv: An Orichalcum
Superbeing Army...

00:05:51.368 --> 00:05:52.805
That's bad news.

00:05:52.838 --> 00:05:55.912
And it's not just their
strength that's bad news.

00:05:55.945 --> 00:05:57.782
It's their mental power.

00:05:57.815 --> 00:05:58.951
Mental power?

00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:02.157
Forbidden Magic that gives
life to inanimate things...

00:06:02.191 --> 00:06:06.499
is heavily affected by the
mentality of the spell's user.

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:08.202
Flazzard was created back when

00:06:08.236 --> 00:06:10.875
Hadlar was obsessed
with victory.

00:06:10.908 --> 00:06:15.183
And that horrible being was
consumed by that same desire.

00:06:15.216 --> 00:06:16.352
I think I get it.

00:06:16.386 --> 00:06:18.155
If that Royal Guard
that he's created

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:21.763
actually cares about having
a fair fight like you said,

00:06:21.797 --> 00:06:23.701
then it means
that Hadlar himself

00:06:23.734 --> 00:06:26.640
has grown as a
warrior after all.

00:06:26.673 --> 00:06:28.578
And so the members
of the Royal Guard

00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:30.782
this "new" Hadlar created...

00:06:30.815 --> 00:06:33.954
are each even
stronger than Flazzard?

00:06:33.988 --> 00:06:35.490
Matoriv: Not only that...

00:06:35.524 --> 00:06:37.628
You and your friends
have won every battle

00:06:37.662 --> 00:06:40.066
up to this point
with teamwork.

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:43.608
But now they're going
to use it, as well.

00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:45.109
This will be difficult.

00:06:46.412 --> 00:06:48.283
Tell me, Mentor, please.

00:06:48.316 --> 00:06:50.821
There must be something
you can teach me.

00:06:50.855 --> 00:06:55.030
Hym reflected a spell ten times
stronger than a Kafrizz...

00:06:55.063 --> 00:06:59.104
A normal flame spell
isn't going to do a thing.

00:06:59.138 --> 00:07:01.576
Not with that
Orichalcum form.

00:07:03.113 --> 00:07:04.649
Popp: What can I do?

00:07:09.458 --> 00:07:10.995
There's one thing.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:12.599
Mentor!

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:14.435
Are you sure you can stand up?

00:07:14.468 --> 00:07:15.638
Let me help!

00:07:15.671 --> 00:07:17.908
Matoriv: Don't worry about me.

00:07:19.546 --> 00:07:21.249
Speaking of Flazzard,

00:07:21.282 --> 00:07:24.188
he was pretty
versatile, wasn't he?

00:07:24.221 --> 00:07:25.424
Popp: Uh, yeah?

00:07:25.457 --> 00:07:28.029
Matoriv: The ability
to use fire and ice.

00:07:28.062 --> 00:07:29.198
Popp: R-Right.

00:07:29.231 --> 00:07:30.801
Matoriv: The idea was decent,

00:07:30.835 --> 00:07:34.475
but his youth and inexperience
caused his failure.

00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:36.880
Had he used the two
elements simultaneously,

00:07:36.913 --> 00:07:39.652
you wouldn't have
stood a chance.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.890
Like this.

00:07:42.992 --> 00:07:43.660
[gasp]

00:07:44.228 --> 00:07:46.533
So, young mage. Try it.

00:07:46.566 --> 00:07:50.775
I-I don't know. I don't
think I can do that.

00:07:50.808 --> 00:07:52.878
Matoriv: This is your answer.

00:07:52.912 --> 00:07:57.020
Master this and whether they're
made of Orichalcum or not,

00:07:57.053 --> 00:07:58.891
you'll always win.

00:07:58.924 --> 00:08:02.732
After all, this is the
strongest spell ever created...

00:08:02.765 --> 00:08:06.573
The power of the
Grand Sorcerer Matoriv.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.610
Quite the spell.

00:08:08.644 --> 00:08:10.881
And I'm going to
teach it to you.

00:08:10.915 --> 00:08:13.988
Well, if this old mage
can still pull it off.

00:08:14.021 --> 00:08:15.390
[chuckling]

00:08:15.423 --> 00:08:16.960
What do you mean?

00:08:16.993 --> 00:08:21.503
Honestly, I've only ever used
this one a handful of times.

00:08:21.536 --> 00:08:23.205
It's too scary.

00:08:24.576 --> 00:08:26.980
Popp [thought]: Mentor
has one of the biggest egos

00:08:27.013 --> 00:08:27.982
in the world...

00:08:28.016 --> 00:08:30.988
and even he's scared
to use this spell?

00:08:31.022 --> 00:08:33.994
Just what kind
of attack is this?!

00:08:34.494 --> 00:08:36.332
Fire and ice.

00:08:36.366 --> 00:08:39.506
They may seem like
opposites, but both

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:43.514
Fire and Ice-type spells
stem from the same source;

00:08:43.547 --> 00:08:46.018
heat-based magic.

00:08:46.052 --> 00:08:50.460
It's just a matter of whether
it's positive or negative.

00:08:50.493 --> 00:08:53.333
Push Magic Power in
the positive direction

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:55.337
for a Fire-type spell...

00:08:55.370 --> 00:09:00.615
And push it in the negative
direction for an Ice-type spell.

00:09:00.648 --> 00:09:02.384
When a mage manages to cast

00:09:02.418 --> 00:09:05.490
both of the elements
at the same time,

00:09:05.524 --> 00:09:09.498
they become the ultimate
destructive force.

00:09:09.532 --> 00:09:10.868
Let me get this
straight, then...

00:09:10.901 --> 00:09:12.739
If I combine the two spells,

00:09:12.772 --> 00:09:15.945
it creates an entirely
different energy...

00:09:15.978 --> 00:09:18.283
an energy that'll
destroy anything?

00:09:18.316 --> 00:09:22.625
Yes. That's very good.
You've grown quite perceptive.

00:09:22.659 --> 00:09:23.694
[delighted chuckle]

00:09:23.728 --> 00:09:25.430
It's my signature...

00:09:25.463 --> 00:09:27.535
An Annihilation-type spell.

00:09:27.568 --> 00:09:29.171
And spell's name?

00:09:30.473 --> 00:09:33.013
I call it Medroa.

00:09:33.046 --> 00:09:34.181
Medroa?

00:09:34.215 --> 00:09:37.822
Matoriv: Like I said,
it's a difficult one.

00:09:37.855 --> 00:09:40.293
For the spell to work you
need to be skilled enough

00:09:40.326 --> 00:09:44.267
to create a perfect balance
between the two types of energy.

00:09:44.301 --> 00:09:47.842
But if you can do that,
you become unbeatable.

00:09:47.876 --> 00:09:51.148
It doesn't matter how
resilient your opponent is.

00:09:51.181 --> 00:09:55.891
This spell will disintegrate
absolutely anything.

00:09:57.327 --> 00:10:01.001
And now you're going to
teach this spell... to me?

00:10:03.373 --> 00:10:04.843
Matoriv: Yeah. I will.

00:10:04.876 --> 00:10:07.414
It's probably the only
thing that will work

00:10:07.447 --> 00:10:09.586
on an Orichalcum enemy.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.690
Oh, wow! Well, then.

00:10:11.723 --> 00:10:14.228
What kind of
training do I need?

00:10:14.261 --> 00:10:15.731
Matoriv: Popp, my boy.

00:10:15.765 --> 00:10:18.604
The training for
this one is simple.

00:10:18.637 --> 00:10:20.406
It'll only take an instant.

00:10:20.439 --> 00:10:22.410
Okay, then.
That's even better!

00:10:22.444 --> 00:10:26.853
Matoriv: Like I said; balance
is the key component here.

00:10:26.887 --> 00:10:30.293
The two elements cannot
be at odds with one another.

00:10:30.327 --> 00:10:34.267
So while it is simple-
you have to have the talent.

00:10:36.573 --> 00:10:39.244
Why don't we see
if you can stop it.

00:10:39.278 --> 00:10:40.313
Huh?

00:10:40.346 --> 00:10:43.152
Matoriv: Cancel it out
with your own Magic Power.

00:10:43.185 --> 00:10:44.387
What? Come on.

00:11:09.004 --> 00:11:10.072
[whimpering]

00:11:29.813 --> 00:11:31.215
Matoriv: This spell...

00:11:31.249 --> 00:11:35.256
can only be cancelled
out by the same magic!

00:11:35.658 --> 00:11:36.926
[whimpering]

00:11:36.959 --> 00:11:38.296
Matoriv: If you
can't successfully

00:11:38.329 --> 00:11:40.901
combine fire and ice...

00:11:40.935 --> 00:11:43.473
you'll be erased
from this world!

00:11:43.507 --> 00:11:46.747
What?! That's crazy, Mentor!

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.751
Matoriv: Here goes, Popp...

00:11:48.784 --> 00:11:51.455
Don't screw up if
you want to live.

00:12:10.695 --> 00:12:13.099
Popp [thought]: Oh, no.
This is too much for me.

00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:15.904
I'll have to run -
try to dodge it!

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:26.693
Popp [thought]: That's right.
Mentor's not well.

00:12:26.727 --> 00:12:28.863
All of that
Forbidden-level magic

00:12:28.897 --> 00:12:31.769
he's been using
is taking its toll.

00:12:32.705 --> 00:12:35.142
He's not as strong as he was!

00:12:36.479 --> 00:12:40.721
Popp [thought]: This spell
takes a great effort to cast.

00:12:40.755 --> 00:12:43.258
And he's willing
to endure it for me!

00:12:45.062 --> 00:12:46.867
Popp [thought]:
I can't run away.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.806
This is about more
than just a spell.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.309
If I run from this,

00:12:51.342 --> 00:12:54.414
I'll have no right
to call him my mentor!

00:13:02.263 --> 00:13:03.465
There it is.

00:13:07.708 --> 00:13:09.444
Here goes...

00:13:11.783 --> 00:13:14.054
Medroa!

00:13:16.727 --> 00:13:26.713
[struggling grunts]

00:13:26.747 --> 00:13:36.767
[struggling grunts]

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.436
Good! Contain it!

00:13:38.469 --> 00:13:43.446
Popp: [roaring]

00:13:43.479 --> 00:13:44.515
Matoriv [thought]: Oh, no...

00:13:44.548 --> 00:13:48.155
Popp has always been
better at Fire-type spells.

00:13:48.188 --> 00:13:51.830
The output of his left hand
is overpowering his right.

00:13:51.863 --> 00:13:52.966
Matoriv: Popp!

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:55.170
You need to focus on
your Ice-type spell!

00:13:55.203 --> 00:13:57.775
Increase the power
from your right hand!

00:13:57.809 --> 00:13:59.813
[roaring]

00:13:59.846 --> 00:14:02.150
I can't-

00:14:02.184 --> 00:14:03.252
[roaring]

00:14:03.285 --> 00:14:04.555
Yes, you can!

00:14:04.589 --> 00:14:06.693
You can do it, Popp!

00:14:06.727 --> 00:14:09.766
[roaring]

00:14:09.799 --> 00:14:13.105
I won't quit!

00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.230
Leona: Oh, man...

00:14:25.263 --> 00:14:27.735
I wish I could train
with all the others.

00:14:27.768 --> 00:14:28.870
[curious chirp]

00:14:28.903 --> 00:14:30.975
A princess has a solemn
duty to her kingdom

00:14:31.008 --> 00:14:32.712
that can't be abandoned.

00:14:32.745 --> 00:14:33.847
[understanding chirp]

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.483
Maybe just this once?

00:14:35.517 --> 00:14:36.853
[surprised chirp]

00:14:36.886 --> 00:14:37.788
[chuckling]

00:14:37.821 --> 00:14:38.890
I'm just kidding.

00:14:38.923 --> 00:14:41.261
[amazed gasp]

00:14:42.263 --> 00:14:45.537
Chiu: The Valge
Whirlpool split in two!

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.322
And now it's one again...

00:15:05.911 --> 00:15:07.614
Wow! Good job!

00:15:08.483 --> 00:15:09.619
Crocodine: It's possible.

00:15:09.652 --> 00:15:11.956
In theory, it will work.

00:15:14.595 --> 00:15:16.767
Uh, are you okay?

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.606
Y-Yeah. I'm fine. Sorry.

00:15:19.639 --> 00:15:23.513
You're out here helping me when
you could be training, too.

00:15:23.547 --> 00:15:25.216
No sweat.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:27.989
I promise it'll
be worth your while.

00:15:28.022 --> 00:15:29.826
I have a gift for you, rat.

00:15:29.859 --> 00:15:31.428
Chiu: Huh? Really?

00:15:31.461 --> 00:15:32.932
What is it?

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:34.167
But first...

00:15:34.902 --> 00:15:36.471
One more time.

00:16:01.522 --> 00:16:03.092
Popp: [whistling]

00:16:03.125 --> 00:16:04.696
Wow. Not bad!

00:16:04.729 --> 00:16:06.131
Maam: Popp?

00:16:06.164 --> 00:16:09.271
Popp: You're actually attacking
every single drop of water.

00:16:09.304 --> 00:16:12.110
I don't think I've ever seen
anything that fast before.

00:16:12.143 --> 00:16:14.247
You better believe it.
In martial arts,

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.418
timing and speed are
everything to a fighter-

00:16:16.451 --> 00:16:18.355
and I'm gonna need
both to take on

00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:21.494
the type of enemy we're
going up against, right?

00:16:21.529 --> 00:16:23.366
Maam: W-What
happened to your arm?

00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:24.668
Oh, nothing.

00:16:24.702 --> 00:16:27.373
I've been training for
a new spell with mentor.

00:16:27.407 --> 00:16:29.912
Whenever I mess up,
this happens.

00:16:29.946 --> 00:16:32.551
Popp: I just dropped
by to cool it off.

00:16:32.585 --> 00:16:34.588
What kind of spell is it?

00:16:34.622 --> 00:16:38.262
Well, you'll see when
I eventually master it.

00:16:38.295 --> 00:16:41.034
This one's the
strongest I've ever seen.

00:16:41.067 --> 00:16:42.804
No matter who
we end up facing,

00:16:42.838 --> 00:16:45.242
I know I'll be
able to take 'em on.

00:16:46.011 --> 00:16:48.082
Well, you seem confident.

00:16:48.116 --> 00:16:50.520
Popp: You can count on me!

00:16:50.554 --> 00:16:54.027
Maam: We have two days left.
I better keep training!

00:16:54.929 --> 00:16:57.234
You'll have to try
a lot harder, right?

00:16:57.267 --> 00:16:59.939
If you really want
to increase your speed?

00:16:59.972 --> 00:17:01.275
I guess that's
why you're wearing

00:17:01.308 --> 00:17:04.114
such an aerodynamic
outfit, am I right?

00:17:04.147 --> 00:17:05.383
What did you say?!

00:17:05.416 --> 00:17:06.520
[chuckling]

00:17:06.553 --> 00:17:07.654
Nothing!

00:17:15.003 --> 00:17:16.672
[roaring]

00:17:17.975 --> 00:17:19.779
[trembling]

00:17:19.812 --> 00:17:21.850
Yikes! You okay?

00:17:21.883 --> 00:17:23.118
Popp: Was that a trap?!

00:17:23.151 --> 00:17:25.156
It's for training
my grappling.

00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:27.160
We're gonna be
facing enemies that are

00:17:27.193 --> 00:17:29.497
immune to my Refractor Fist.

00:17:29.532 --> 00:17:32.504
Popp [thought]: That's it.
I gotta smarten up, for good.

00:17:35.643 --> 00:17:38.482
Popp [thought]: Maam is more
dangerous than I realized.

00:17:47.033 --> 00:17:48.803
Popp: Balance...

00:17:48.836 --> 00:17:51.542
It's about perfect balance...

00:18:27.013 --> 00:18:28.482
Matoriv [thought]: Not again.

00:18:37.802 --> 00:18:38.904
Popp: How's that, Mentor?

00:18:38.937 --> 00:18:42.343
I know my Fire-type Magic
is still a bit too strong.

00:18:44.682 --> 00:18:47.386
But... Not too far off.

00:18:55.302 --> 00:18:56.539
I have truly...

00:18:56.572 --> 00:19:00.446
Never once been more
impressed with your skill.

00:19:00.479 --> 00:19:01.448
[chuckling]

00:19:01.482 --> 00:19:02.918
Popp: That's the first
time you've ever said

00:19:02.951 --> 00:19:05.023
you were impressed
by me at all.

00:19:05.056 --> 00:19:07.561
Maybe it's time you retire.

00:19:07.594 --> 00:19:08.496
Matoriv: [scoff]

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:11.301
You kids always get
ahead of yourselves.

00:19:11.335 --> 00:19:13.405
Popp: I'm serious, Mentor.

00:19:13.439 --> 00:19:16.144
I'll learn every
skill you know.

00:19:16.177 --> 00:19:19.317
That way you don't have
to push yourself anymore.

00:19:21.287 --> 00:19:23.659
I think... I can
take it from here.

00:19:25.062 --> 00:19:26.932
Why did you
choose to be a Mage

00:19:26.966 --> 00:19:29.672
when you became
a Disciple of Avan?

00:19:29.706 --> 00:19:30.608
Huh?

00:19:30.641 --> 00:19:33.412
Why not a kind of
Warrior, or even a Hero?

00:19:33.446 --> 00:19:35.550
Master Avan convinced me.

00:19:36.184 --> 00:19:37.453
It's true, y'know.

00:19:37.486 --> 00:19:40.660
I sense a great potential
for magic inside of you.

00:19:41.194 --> 00:19:42.463
Actually...

00:19:42.497 --> 00:19:45.737
You kinda remind me of
an old, old friend of mine.

00:19:46.839 --> 00:19:48.175
And that was that.

00:19:48.208 --> 00:19:50.780
I was meant to be
a mage all along.

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:53.385
Matoriv [thought]:
That man really had

00:19:53.419 --> 00:19:56.324
an eye for talent,
didn't he?

00:19:56.357 --> 00:19:58.095
Matoriv: If you
want me to retire,

00:19:58.128 --> 00:20:00.332
you better impress
me some more.

00:20:05.911 --> 00:20:08.248
Zaboera: Let me out of here!

00:20:08.281 --> 00:20:11.021
I am the Mystic
Legion Commander.

00:20:11.054 --> 00:20:12.691
Quiet down, fool.

00:20:12.724 --> 00:20:15.063
Lord Hadlar has
mercifully granted you

00:20:15.096 --> 00:20:16.833
the luxury of imprisonment-

00:20:16.866 --> 00:20:19.538
which is more than you
deserve, in my eyes.

00:20:19.572 --> 00:20:22.678
Zaboera: I don't deserve
any of this, tin-man!

00:20:22.711 --> 00:20:25.182
Find some remorse.

00:20:25.215 --> 00:20:27.521
Hey! Get back here, right now!

00:20:28.355 --> 00:20:31.262
If I may say, Lord Hadlar...

00:20:31.295 --> 00:20:33.331
What is it, Albinass?

00:20:33.365 --> 00:20:36.071
That prisoner
should be executed.

00:20:36.104 --> 00:20:38.308
He is merely a parasite.

00:20:38.342 --> 00:20:39.945
If he is allowed to live,

00:20:39.978 --> 00:20:44.220
he will be a hindrance to
any strategy that you have.

00:20:44.254 --> 00:20:45.991
Hadlar: It is
through his research

00:20:46.024 --> 00:20:47.994
that my body
was enhanced.

00:20:48.028 --> 00:20:53.138
It cost him his son.
He's earned this small mercy.

00:20:53.171 --> 00:20:55.242
Let him cool off in his cell.

00:20:55.275 --> 00:20:58.282
Yes. If that is your command.

00:20:58.315 --> 00:21:01.187
Hadlar: The old me
would have killed him

00:21:01.221 --> 00:21:03.291
without a second thought.

00:21:04.026 --> 00:21:05.864
Am I too soft?

00:21:05.898 --> 00:21:07.534
You are magnanimous,

00:21:07.567 --> 00:21:10.974
if a bit too lenient
on parasites like him.

00:21:11.008 --> 00:21:12.177
Hadlar: [chuckling]

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:14.815
You don't hold back, do you?

00:21:16.886 --> 00:21:18.489
Now, Killvearn,

00:21:18.523 --> 00:21:21.596
I have a task that
requires your skills.

00:21:21.629 --> 00:21:23.633
Killvearn: An assassination?

00:21:23.666 --> 00:21:26.639
I don't think Hadlar
would appreciate me

00:21:26.673 --> 00:21:30.312
getting to the Disciples
of Avan before he does.

00:21:30.346 --> 00:21:33.218
Oh, it's not the
Disciples this time.

00:21:33.251 --> 00:21:36.424
And I can't even
guarantee your success.

00:21:36.457 --> 00:21:38.361
Intriguing, hm?

00:21:39.297 --> 00:21:43.573
This one, at his core,
is still a father.
