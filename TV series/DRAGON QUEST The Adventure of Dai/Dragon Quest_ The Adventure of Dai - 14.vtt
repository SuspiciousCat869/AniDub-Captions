WEBVTT

00:00:12.626 --> 00:00:14.930
Narrator: A Hero:
the keeper of peace

00:00:14.964 --> 00:00:16.365
who protects the innocent,

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:19.138
and battles the
forces of darkness.

00:00:20.107 --> 00:00:21.877
The young boy Dai-

00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:24.148
raised on a remote
island by monsters-

00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:26.286
has taken up the
mantel of his mentor,

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:29.660
the legendary Hero Avan.

00:00:29.693 --> 00:00:32.264
Traveling with Popp,
the excitable Mage;

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:35.037
and Maam, the brave
Warrior Priest...

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.742
Dai intends to stop
the Dark Lord Hadlar

00:00:37.775 --> 00:00:41.148
from overrunning the world
with his Six Legions.

00:00:42.484 --> 00:00:46.059
So far, the Disciples of Avan
have defeated Crocodine,

00:00:46.092 --> 00:00:48.163
leader of the
Furfang Legion...

00:00:48.196 --> 00:00:51.302
As well as Hyunckel,
of the Undead Legion.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.512
Dai continues on
the path of a Hero,

00:00:55.545 --> 00:00:58.450
but his next adversary
General Flazzard

00:00:58.483 --> 00:01:00.688
plans to stop
him in his tracks.

00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:03.359
[evil cackle]

00:03:01.362 --> 00:03:04.936
Popp: Is something wrong,
Maam? You seem blue.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.441
Oh, I'm fine. Thanks Popp.

00:03:07.474 --> 00:03:10.514
That's nice of you,
but I was just thinking.

00:03:12.284 --> 00:03:13.620
Popp: About Hyunckel?

00:03:15.758 --> 00:03:17.261
Yeah.

00:03:17.295 --> 00:03:21.937
Did you - Well, uh-
I mean... like...

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.507
Did you like him?

00:03:23.541 --> 00:03:24.676
Maam: Huh?

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:27.515
I don't really know.

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.855
Maam: But when I looked
into those sad eyes of his,

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.293
I just wanted to help him.

00:03:33.326 --> 00:03:36.232
I wanted to be by his side.

00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:38.236
I got that feeling.

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:39.304
Popp: Don't worry!

00:03:39.338 --> 00:03:42.210
It's all okay.
I'll bet he's fine.

00:03:42.244 --> 00:03:44.849
After what Dai and
I threw at that guy,

00:03:44.883 --> 00:03:48.190
Hyunckel was still as
tough as ever, remember?

00:03:48.223 --> 00:03:49.125
That's true.

00:03:49.158 --> 00:03:50.426
He's still out there.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.667
The Undead Legion Commander
wouldn't die so easily.

00:03:53.701 --> 00:03:56.807
You're right. Thank you
for that, really, Popp.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.377
Popp: Uh, sure.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.380
Maam: He must be alive.

00:04:00.414 --> 00:04:03.420
He was a Disciple
of Avan, after all.

00:04:03.453 --> 00:04:05.691
Popp [thought]: Oh, man!
What the hell am I doing?!

00:04:05.725 --> 00:04:09.599
Here I am, talking up my
rival like... like a loser.

00:04:09.632 --> 00:04:11.069
[pained groan]

00:04:11.102 --> 00:04:12.806
That was a bad idea...

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:14.374
Baduck: There. Finished!

00:04:16.212 --> 00:04:19.318
Wow, it's just
like new again. Amazing!

00:04:19.352 --> 00:04:21.022
[satisfied chuckle]

00:04:21.055 --> 00:04:22.357
Baduck: They used to call me

00:04:22.391 --> 00:04:24.730
the Papnica Inventor
King, you know.

00:04:24.763 --> 00:04:26.432
Uh-huh? What
happened to being

00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:29.438
"the greatest swordsman
in Papnica", old man?

00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:33.981
Now we're all set, you guys.
So, let's go rescue Leona!

00:04:34.015 --> 00:04:35.217
Baduck: The problem is...

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.622
we still don't know where
she's actually gone.

00:04:37.655 --> 00:04:40.494
He's right, Dai.
Leona's still missing.

00:04:40.528 --> 00:04:44.168
And where to look in this
vast continent of Holkia?

00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:46.272
Popp: I guess we'll
have to take it slowly.

00:04:46.305 --> 00:04:47.575
But if we don't hurry,

00:04:47.609 --> 00:04:50.180
the Dark Army might send out
another Legion Commander

00:04:50.213 --> 00:04:52.151
and get to the
princess before we do.

00:04:52.184 --> 00:04:53.420
Leona...

00:04:53.453 --> 00:04:54.923
Baduck: That's it!

00:04:55.992 --> 00:04:57.662
What're you excited about?

00:04:57.695 --> 00:05:01.136
Baduck: The temple!
We'll go to the temple!

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:02.538
The temple?

00:05:05.812 --> 00:05:06.780
Popp: Hey, old-timer,

00:05:06.814 --> 00:05:09.586
so what's supposed to be
in this place, anyway?

00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:12.491
Baduck: The temple has some
things stored underground.

00:05:12.525 --> 00:05:15.096
So, let's try to
find the entrance.

00:05:16.265 --> 00:05:17.903
Easier said than done.

00:05:17.936 --> 00:05:21.108
And what exactly are
they storing underground?

00:05:21.141 --> 00:05:22.578
Signal flares!

00:05:23.747 --> 00:05:25.383
Signal flares?

00:05:25.416 --> 00:05:28.624
Yes, that's right.
Papnica uses flares in battle.

00:05:28.658 --> 00:05:32.264
They fire signals high into
the sky using gunpowder.

00:05:32.297 --> 00:05:33.968
With gunpowder?

00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:35.471
If we can find and launch one,

00:05:35.505 --> 00:05:38.110
the Princess is sure
to see it wherever she is.

00:05:38.143 --> 00:05:40.982
Even if it's miles away.

00:05:41.015 --> 00:05:42.151
Maam: Oh, I see.

00:05:42.184 --> 00:05:43.152
It'll work, okay?

00:05:43.185 --> 00:05:45.057
We fire the
red victory signal,

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.461
I'm willing to bet
that Her Majesty would feel

00:05:47.494 --> 00:05:49.766
as if it's safe enough
to come back here.

00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:50.834
Dai: Found it!

00:05:54.008 --> 00:05:56.513
Hey, guys - this might
actually be the place!

00:05:57.081 --> 00:05:58.449
No good...

00:05:59.351 --> 00:06:00.922
We can't get in.

00:06:00.955 --> 00:06:04.796
But... I don't think
we can move all this.

00:06:07.301 --> 00:06:10.608
Everybody get back.
Leave it to me!

00:06:14.214 --> 00:06:16.519
He seems pretty
eager, doesn't he?

00:06:16.553 --> 00:06:17.855
Yeah, he's
probably desperate

00:06:17.888 --> 00:06:20.561
to test out his
improved strength.

00:06:20.594 --> 00:06:22.464
Popp: He's been
eager since I told him

00:06:22.498 --> 00:06:25.236
he beat Hyunckel without
the power of his mark.

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.372
Dai [thought]:
Let's find out

00:06:26.405 --> 00:06:28.977
whether I can use
that skill or not!

00:06:32.217 --> 00:06:33.152
Frizz!

00:06:33.185 --> 00:06:34.522
[amazed gasps]

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:38.797
Moron! Wait, don't!

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:42.404
Dai: Fire Earth Slash!

00:06:51.489 --> 00:06:53.593
Dai: Yes! I really did it!

00:06:54.863 --> 00:06:56.198
You idiot!

00:06:56.231 --> 00:06:58.369
Of all the attacks
you could use.

00:06:58.403 --> 00:07:00.975
There's gunpowder
down there, y'know?!

00:07:01.008 --> 00:07:02.812
Actual gunpowder!

00:07:05.149 --> 00:07:06.252
Popp: Oh, great.

00:07:06.285 --> 00:07:09.057
Baduck: They've ignited! Run!

00:07:10.561 --> 00:07:12.698
[worried breaths]

00:07:34.575 --> 00:07:37.949
Well, team. All the signal
flares were blown away.

00:07:37.982 --> 00:07:39.485
Not a single one left.

00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:41.990
Popp: Hey, uh, wise guy.

00:07:42.024 --> 00:07:44.294
You coulda just used a
Crack spell or something...

00:07:44.327 --> 00:07:46.466
Like an ice attack,
y'know? Hmm?

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:47.535
Sorry...

00:07:47.568 --> 00:07:48.704
Well either way,

00:07:48.738 --> 00:07:50.942
at least we managed to
get the flares launched?

00:07:50.975 --> 00:07:53.246
Don't you think that
maybe Princess Leona

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:55.083
could've gotten the message?

00:07:55.116 --> 00:07:58.089
I dunno. With a big
light show like that,

00:07:58.122 --> 00:08:02.263
she might just get suspicious
and stay in hiding instead.

00:08:03.534 --> 00:08:04.869
Dai: Sorry.

00:08:09.211 --> 00:08:10.714
What's that thing up there?

00:08:12.952 --> 00:08:15.223
It doesn't look like
a bird of any kind...

00:08:15.257 --> 00:08:16.392
A monster?

00:08:16.425 --> 00:08:18.062
No, I think...

00:08:19.198 --> 00:08:23.541
Baduck: That's...
The Papnica Balloon Ship!

00:08:23.574 --> 00:08:24.976
Papnica Balloon Ship?

00:08:25.009 --> 00:08:27.615
Baduck: It's a vehicle
that travels by air.

00:08:27.649 --> 00:08:29.820
The royal family uses it!

00:08:29.853 --> 00:08:31.021
All: What?!

00:08:34.161 --> 00:08:35.229
Take us down.

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:39.338
I don't believe it.
That's Baduck!

00:08:39.372 --> 00:08:41.476
Hey! Hey!

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.279
Baduck: Down here!

00:08:43.313 --> 00:08:44.382
Wow.

00:08:44.415 --> 00:08:46.252
Yep, that is impressive.

00:08:46.285 --> 00:08:48.155
Baduck: Hey!

00:08:48.189 --> 00:08:50.293
[delighted chuckle]

00:08:51.262 --> 00:08:52.965
[delighted chuckle]

00:09:01.215 --> 00:09:02.618
Lady Amy!

00:09:02.651 --> 00:09:04.589
Sir Baduck, was it
you who sent up

00:09:04.623 --> 00:09:07.026
all those flares
a little while ago?

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.398
You really know that
girl, old-timer?

00:09:09.431 --> 00:09:10.734
Introduce me!

00:09:11.503 --> 00:09:13.774
Fool! Show some respect!

00:09:13.807 --> 00:09:17.080
You are in the presence of
one of the Papnica Troika;

00:09:17.114 --> 00:09:18.517
Lady Amy.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.222
For real, a woman that young?

00:09:21.255 --> 00:09:23.159
And all this time I thought...

00:09:23.193 --> 00:09:25.864
We're the Papnica Troika!

00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:28.269
We thought that signal
was a little strange,

00:09:28.303 --> 00:09:30.273
so we came here
to check it out.

00:09:30.306 --> 00:09:33.781
I left the Princess back with
Apollo and Marin for safety.

00:09:33.814 --> 00:09:36.051
Dai: By Princess,
you mean Leona, right?

00:09:36.085 --> 00:09:39.191
Is she okay? Have you
seen her? Where is she?!

00:09:39.224 --> 00:09:40.226
Who are you?

00:09:40.259 --> 00:09:43.299
I rescued Princess Leona
on Dermline island.

00:09:43.332 --> 00:09:45.137
My name is Dai.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:46.138
You're Dai?

00:09:46.171 --> 00:09:47.207
The Hero, Dai?

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.209
That's right.

00:09:48.243 --> 00:09:50.047
This young man is
the Hero that Her Majesty

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.718
has been going on
and on about, lately.

00:09:52.752 --> 00:09:55.456
And he sure lives up
to his reputation,

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:56.960
because he and his
friends have already

00:09:56.993 --> 00:09:59.331
vanquished the Undead Legion.

00:09:59.365 --> 00:10:01.537
You all can rest easy now.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:02.404
They what?!

00:10:02.437 --> 00:10:04.008
Vanquished the Undead Legion?!

00:10:04.041 --> 00:10:07.147
So, you're actually Dai,
the young Hero?

00:10:14.862 --> 00:10:18.035
Amy: This weapon belongs to
the Papnica royal family.

00:10:19.505 --> 00:10:21.676
Leona's the one
who gave it to me.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:26.452
It's my greatest treasure!

00:10:26.486 --> 00:10:28.690
Well, then. Come with us.

00:10:28.723 --> 00:10:31.328
The Princess waits
on Valge Island.

00:10:31.361 --> 00:10:32.665
On Valge Island?

00:10:32.698 --> 00:10:34.902
The Princess is all
the way out there?!

00:10:41.983 --> 00:10:43.019
Oh, wow!

00:10:43.052 --> 00:10:44.723
So high!

00:10:44.756 --> 00:10:46.693
This balloon is amazing.

00:10:46.726 --> 00:10:47.995
[proud chuckle]

00:10:48.029 --> 00:10:48.830
Of course.

00:10:48.864 --> 00:10:50.500
It's the only Balloon Ship

00:10:50.534 --> 00:10:52.571
in the Papnica Kingdom,
don't you know.

00:10:52.605 --> 00:10:55.343
Hey, that's not the only
thing that surprised us.

00:10:55.376 --> 00:10:56.679
When you came from the sky,

00:10:56.713 --> 00:10:59.452
I thought that you were
the Princess, Lady Amy.

00:10:59.485 --> 00:11:01.255
You sure look the part!

00:11:01.289 --> 00:11:02.525
Oh, that's nonsense.

00:11:02.558 --> 00:11:04.328
The Princess is
far more beautiful

00:11:04.361 --> 00:11:05.864
than I could
ever hope to be,

00:11:05.898 --> 00:11:08.236
but regardless,
I'm flattered.

00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:11.008
Well, I can't
wait to meet her then.

00:11:11.042 --> 00:11:11.909
[chuckle]

00:11:11.943 --> 00:11:14.281
Gross. You are
such a creep, Popp.

00:11:14.315 --> 00:11:15.417
Oh, yeah?

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:18.022
Come on - it's a Princess
we're talking about here-

00:11:18.055 --> 00:11:20.060
I mean, who wouldn't
be curious?

00:11:20.093 --> 00:11:22.565
I'll bet that
she's cute and gentle,

00:11:22.598 --> 00:11:24.367
unlike someone else I know.

00:11:24.401 --> 00:11:25.537
Uh, what?

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:29.613
Leona is cute, but, she's
not really the gentle-type.

00:11:29.646 --> 00:11:31.315
Huh? What do you mean?

00:11:31.348 --> 00:11:33.052
Dai: She's brutally honest.

00:11:33.086 --> 00:11:35.423
In fact, she could
be worse than Maam.

00:11:35.456 --> 00:11:36.527
[offended huff]

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.564
Popp: Worse than Maam?

00:11:38.597 --> 00:11:40.968
I'll believe
it when I see it.

00:11:41.001 --> 00:11:42.705
What's that supposed to mean?

00:11:42.739 --> 00:11:46.111
She'd have to be
an ogre. Impossible.

00:11:48.517 --> 00:11:49.819
-Maam: Why, you...
-Guard: Hey, hey!

00:11:49.853 --> 00:11:51.723
-Maam: One more!
-Popp: Help me! Someone help!

00:11:51.756 --> 00:11:53.259
Guard: Hey! Behave yourselves.

00:12:10.327 --> 00:12:11.495
Guard: There's the island!

00:12:22.718 --> 00:12:24.822
Popp: So that's Valge Island?!

00:12:24.855 --> 00:12:27.795
Whoa. Why is the sea spinning?

00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:29.999
Amy: That's the
Valge Whirlpool.

00:12:30.033 --> 00:12:31.770
It's dangerous,
and because of that

00:12:31.803 --> 00:12:35.009
most people avoid
the island altogether.

00:12:35.042 --> 00:12:38.082
To get there by boat
requires taking a long route

00:12:38.116 --> 00:12:41.022
that goes all the way around
the mouth of the whirlpool.

00:12:41.055 --> 00:12:43.527
Indeed, and Valge Tower
is the only thing

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.030
worth seeing on that island.

00:12:45.063 --> 00:12:46.933
I never would have
guessed that Her Majesty

00:12:46.967 --> 00:12:49.070
would be hiding out
in that place.

00:12:49.104 --> 00:12:51.275
Well, it's all
thanks to this ship.

00:12:51.309 --> 00:12:53.345
Amy: We've been using
it to deliver messages

00:12:53.379 --> 00:12:56.953
while we plan for a
counterattack on the Dark Army.

00:12:58.389 --> 00:13:01.428
That must be the tower
in the middle of the island.

00:13:02.196 --> 00:13:04.401
It used to be used
as a lighthouse,

00:13:04.434 --> 00:13:05.971
if I remember correctly.

00:13:06.005 --> 00:13:08.475
And that's where Leona is.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:09.846
Dai [thought]: Finally...

00:13:09.879 --> 00:13:12.885
I'll finally get to see
the princess again!

00:13:13.887 --> 00:13:15.591
Let go, you son of a-

00:13:15.625 --> 00:13:17.393
Shut up. It's mine!

00:13:19.097 --> 00:13:21.301
-It's mine!
-That's enough!

00:13:21.335 --> 00:13:23.038
Apollo: What is it?!
What's going on?!

00:13:23.072 --> 00:13:25.777
Apollo, sir...
Lady Marin...

00:13:25.811 --> 00:13:27.849
They're all fighting
over the rations!

00:13:27.882 --> 00:13:29.985
They're fighting about food?

00:13:31.623 --> 00:13:34.028
Enough. You're
embarrassing yourselves.

00:13:34.061 --> 00:13:35.564
It's all his fault, sir!

00:13:35.597 --> 00:13:38.235
He was trying to take
more than his fair share!

00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:41.142
I've been on guard for three
days straight, you know.

00:13:41.175 --> 00:13:43.012
I deserve to eat this much!

00:13:43.045 --> 00:13:45.884
I haven't eaten
anything in a whole day!

00:13:45.917 --> 00:13:48.355
Shut up! Let go!

00:13:48.388 --> 00:13:49.525
No, you let go!

00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:50.894
Leona: Hand it over.

00:13:52.197 --> 00:13:53.633
Princess!

00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:55.202
All: Your Majesty?!

00:14:03.186 --> 00:14:05.758
Wait. What are you doing?

00:14:05.791 --> 00:14:06.727
Leona: Throwing it away!

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:07.862
All: What?!

00:14:07.895 --> 00:14:10.499
But it's the last
of our valuable food!

00:14:10.534 --> 00:14:13.406
Leona: Valuable or not,
if it sparks conflict,

00:14:13.439 --> 00:14:15.009
I don't want it.

00:14:16.445 --> 00:14:17.480
Leona: All of you...

00:14:17.514 --> 00:14:20.119
Don't forget, the reason
we're in hiding, working,

00:14:20.152 --> 00:14:22.123
and preparing for
a counterattack...

00:14:22.157 --> 00:14:23.660
is so that we can someday

00:14:23.693 --> 00:14:26.098
put an end to
evil of the Dark Army.

00:14:26.131 --> 00:14:28.202
Leona: That's a
tall enough order.

00:14:28.235 --> 00:14:32.110
How can we fight amongst
ourselves over our own greed?

00:14:32.143 --> 00:14:35.116
Leona: We'd be no different
than the Dark Army itself.

00:14:35.149 --> 00:14:38.957
If the alternative
is to live as monsters,

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:42.196
I'd rather starve
as human beings!

00:14:43.666 --> 00:14:45.369
I'm so ashamed.

00:14:46.238 --> 00:14:49.011
You've barely eaten
either, Princess.

00:14:49.044 --> 00:14:53.419
And yet here we are,
the first to complain.

00:14:53.453 --> 00:14:55.090
Please, forgive us!

00:14:55.123 --> 00:14:57.528
We are so very sorry.

00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:00.901
Have you all calmed down?

00:15:00.935 --> 00:15:02.037
All: Yes!

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:04.909
Leona: Good. Then talk
it over and share.

00:15:04.942 --> 00:15:06.211
All: Great!

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:13.392
Just have patience.

00:15:13.426 --> 00:15:16.132
We just need to hold out
for a little bit longer.

00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:17.869
I know in my heart that

00:15:17.902 --> 00:15:20.072
the Hero's on his
way to save everyone!

00:15:20.105 --> 00:15:22.879
You mean the young man
you're always speaking of?

00:15:22.912 --> 00:15:24.849
The one called... Dai?

00:15:24.882 --> 00:15:25.985
Leona: Yes.

00:15:26.018 --> 00:15:28.623
He might be a little
short in stature...

00:15:28.656 --> 00:15:31.028
But he's got the Hero spirit.

00:15:31.061 --> 00:15:32.931
I sent him a tutor
a while ago,

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:35.937
so hopefully he's gotten
a lot stronger by now.

00:15:35.971 --> 00:15:37.274
Aw, c'mon.

00:15:37.307 --> 00:15:39.745
That's not a very nice way
to speak about our savior.

00:15:39.779 --> 00:15:43.286
[laughing]

00:15:43.319 --> 00:15:45.624
Do you think the
boy will actually come?

00:15:45.658 --> 00:15:47.227
We're running out of time.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.097
Let's believe that he will.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:53.005
Apollo: At the very least,
the Princess believes.

00:15:53.039 --> 00:15:55.611
And if the Princess
believes in him,

00:15:55.644 --> 00:15:57.381
then so too should all of us.

00:15:57.414 --> 00:15:59.317
Flazzard: That's a
pipe dream, right there.

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:00.019
[alarmed grunts]

00:16:00.052 --> 00:16:01.255
Flazzard: The Hero and company

00:16:01.288 --> 00:16:03.861
are at the bottom
of a pool of lava.

00:16:03.894 --> 00:16:04.895
Who's there?

00:16:04.929 --> 00:16:07.300
Flazzard: [amused chuckle]

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:11.175
Such leadership and
charisma for a little girl.

00:16:11.208 --> 00:16:14.548
I may have scored a bigger
fish than I thought.

00:16:16.118 --> 00:16:16.953
Soldier: Over there!

00:16:16.986 --> 00:16:19.057
Stay there! Who are you?

00:16:19.091 --> 00:16:22.397
Flazzard: I, am Blizzblaze
General Flazzard.

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:25.604
Too bad I ain't your Hero,
little Princess,

00:16:25.638 --> 00:16:27.741
but you'll join him soon.

00:16:27.775 --> 00:16:29.110
[laughing]

00:16:29.143 --> 00:16:30.045
The Dark Army?

00:16:30.079 --> 00:16:31.414
Curse you!

00:16:36.157 --> 00:16:39.965
Apollo: One was burned and
the other was frozen...

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:44.942
Be careful. He can
control both fire and ice.

00:16:44.975 --> 00:16:47.881
Sure can. How about I show you?

00:16:47.915 --> 00:16:51.923
Flazzard: Today the Papnica
royal family meets its end.

00:16:51.956 --> 00:16:53.292
Ridiculous!

00:16:53.325 --> 00:16:56.533
We're not gonna let you lay
a finger on our Princess!

00:16:56.566 --> 00:16:58.268
Let's bring him down!

00:17:00.741 --> 00:17:02.511
His fire is too powerful!

00:17:02.544 --> 00:17:03.446
[chuckling]

00:17:03.479 --> 00:17:08.623
That too hot?
Then let me cool you down!

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:18.777
[pained groans]

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:20.412
With one blow?

00:17:20.446 --> 00:17:22.083
Apollo:
The temperature difference.

00:17:22.117 --> 00:17:24.889
That rapid shift from
the heat of the fire to ice

00:17:24.922 --> 00:17:26.759
must've weakened their armor!

00:17:28.195 --> 00:17:30.266
Flazzard: Looks like
we got at least one guy

00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:32.103
with some brains here.

00:17:32.137 --> 00:17:35.877
I am Sir Apollo of the
Papnica Troika! Stand down!

00:17:35.911 --> 00:17:37.782
Lady Marin - at the ready!

00:17:37.815 --> 00:17:41.856
We shall both protect
Princess Leona with our lives!

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.327
Oh, really? Good for you.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.133
Marin; you try and hit
the fire side of him

00:17:47.167 --> 00:17:48.336
with a Crack spell.

00:17:48.369 --> 00:17:50.574
I'll do something
about the other half.

00:17:50.607 --> 00:17:51.643
Right.

00:17:51.676 --> 00:17:54.380
Apollo: Here goes! Kafrizz!

00:17:55.517 --> 00:17:56.819
Kacrack!

00:18:02.664 --> 00:18:04.502
[amused laugh]

00:18:04.535 --> 00:18:06.071
Goodie, goodie.

00:18:06.104 --> 00:18:09.410
Giving me a feast
as a welcome, are you?

00:18:12.818 --> 00:18:13.986
No, stop!

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.393
He's somehow absorbing the
energy of both of your spells!

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.136
Right back at you.

00:18:25.711 --> 00:18:27.080
Insulatle!

00:18:27.113 --> 00:18:29.518
Insulatle? Well, well.

00:18:33.392 --> 00:18:35.229
It turns out that
your "Troika" title

00:18:35.263 --> 00:18:37.433
ain't just for
show, is it now?

00:18:37.467 --> 00:18:41.075
Now matter how strong your fire
or ice-type spells may be,

00:18:41.108 --> 00:18:43.079
you cannot pierce
this defensive shield!

00:18:43.112 --> 00:18:46.586
Yeah, okay, I get it.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.792
Then out of respect for
your heroic performance,

00:18:49.826 --> 00:18:53.466
let me show you a neat trick
that I recently picked up...

00:18:53.499 --> 00:18:54.835
A trick?

00:18:54.869 --> 00:18:57.373
K...

00:18:57.407 --> 00:18:59.478
a...

00:18:59.512 --> 00:19:01.782
f-r...

00:19:01.816 --> 00:19:04.522
i...

00:19:04.556 --> 00:19:06.291
z-z!

00:19:09.999 --> 00:19:13.372
Five Finger Flare!

00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:21.421
[pained cry]

00:19:24.729 --> 00:19:27.333
Baduck: Look!
Something's wrong down there!

00:19:27.366 --> 00:19:29.905
Guard: Could the
Princess be in danger?!

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:39.725
Leona [thought]: He fired
five Kafrizz spells at once.

00:19:40.493 --> 00:19:43.432
He's unbelievably powerful.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.169
[pained groan]

00:19:45.202 --> 00:19:47.874
Apollo... please,
let me heal you!

00:19:49.278 --> 00:19:55.255
[struggling grunts]

00:19:56.091 --> 00:19:57.293
You menace!

00:19:57.327 --> 00:19:59.565
How could you do
that to Marin?

00:19:59.598 --> 00:20:01.936
Flazzard: Don't make me laugh!

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:03.439
It's a battlefield.

00:20:03.472 --> 00:20:06.211
Flazzard: It doesn't
matter who you are!

00:20:06.245 --> 00:20:11.287
Here, the strong survive
and the weak ones die!

00:20:11.956 --> 00:20:13.391
[pained grunt]

00:20:13.425 --> 00:20:17.266
If you don't want pain, then
stay off of the battlefield!

00:20:17.299 --> 00:20:19.872
Princess, wouldn't you agree?

00:20:21.441 --> 00:20:23.746
I'll bet your majesty
is even prepared

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:27.353
to go the same way her
puny little kingdom did.

00:20:27.387 --> 00:20:30.326
[menacing laughter]

00:20:30.359 --> 00:20:32.998
Dai: Hurry! Get us down there!

00:20:33.031 --> 00:20:34.768
Amy: Can you land on the roof?

00:20:34.802 --> 00:20:36.338
Guard: Yes, my lady!

00:20:36.371 --> 00:20:37.941
Dai [thought]: Leona...

00:20:39.545 --> 00:20:40.547
Crack!

00:20:44.287 --> 00:20:45.323
[amused chuckle]

00:20:45.356 --> 00:20:48.462
Well, so much
for the Papnica Kingdom.

00:20:48.495 --> 00:20:51.101
Flazzard: When the survivors
hear of your demise,

00:20:51.134 --> 00:20:52.671
they'll lose all hope.

00:20:52.705 --> 00:20:54.708
And I'm sure
they'll never consider

00:20:54.742 --> 00:20:57.781
going up against
the Dark Army again.

00:20:57.815 --> 00:21:02.925
Leona: Don't assume humans
are anything like you monsters!

00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:04.294
What was that?

00:21:04.327 --> 00:21:06.297
There will always be someone.

00:21:06.331 --> 00:21:09.371
Someone who'll stand up
against a villain like you!

00:21:09.404 --> 00:21:13.345
Leona: So long as
humanity has its pride!

00:21:13.379 --> 00:21:15.617
Flazzard: That's
some courage there.

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:18.188
Right when you're
about to die!

00:21:18.221 --> 00:21:20.126
Bye-bye, Princess.

00:21:20.159 --> 00:21:23.599
Go act tough on your way
to the afterlife!

00:21:29.143 --> 00:21:31.515
Leona [thought]:
Wait... that knife...

00:21:31.949 --> 00:21:33.084
Who?!

00:21:35.389 --> 00:21:36.491
It's Dai!

00:21:36.525 --> 00:21:39.197
No way.
You're still alive?!

00:21:39.231 --> 00:21:41.367
Get away from Leona!

00:21:42.537 --> 00:21:44.440
Come and make me!

00:21:48.482 --> 00:21:51.255
If you even touch her...

00:21:51.288 --> 00:21:53.425
You're gonna regret it!

00:21:54.026 --> 00:21:55.095
Get him, Dai!

00:21:57.099 --> 00:21:58.836
You little brat!

00:23:37.768 --> 00:23:38.903
Narrator: Dai goes to battle

00:23:38.936 --> 00:23:40.940
with Blizzblaze
General Flazzard,

00:23:40.974 --> 00:23:43.513
but soon the Blitz
Captain's ruthless tactics

00:23:43.546 --> 00:23:45.550
prove difficult to beat.

00:23:45.584 --> 00:23:48.488
With their adversary obsessed
with winning at any cost,

00:23:48.523 --> 00:23:51.361
Dai and his friends
fall into peril.

00:23:51.394 --> 00:23:52.698
And even worse,

00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:56.404
Princess Leona falls prey
to Flazzard's cruel plans.

00:23:56.438 --> 00:23:57.941
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:57.974 --> 00:24:00.379
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:00.412 --> 00:24:02.717
