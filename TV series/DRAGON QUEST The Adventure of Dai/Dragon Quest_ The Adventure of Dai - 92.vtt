WEBVTT

00:01:50.722 --> 00:01:54.529
Myst: [evil cackle]

00:01:54.563 --> 00:01:56.065
Hyunckel: All those
years you spent

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:58.103
teaching me the
ways of darkness...

00:01:58.136 --> 00:02:01.442
you were planning to
use me as your next vessel.

00:02:01.476 --> 00:02:04.215
Myst: It's far too late
to be realizing that.

00:02:04.248 --> 00:02:05.885
Back when I found you -

00:02:05.918 --> 00:02:10.127
after you'd abandoned Avan's
teachings, an idea came to me.

00:02:10.161 --> 00:02:11.563
As strong as it was,

00:02:11.596 --> 00:02:15.270
the body I inhabited still
belonged to King Vearn.

00:02:15.304 --> 00:02:17.609
It would never
be mine to keep.

00:02:17.642 --> 00:02:20.515
Even if I found a replacement,
there was no guarantee

00:02:20.548 --> 00:02:24.121
such a host would be
compatible with my energy.

00:02:24.154 --> 00:02:26.527
But if I were to raise
one from scratch...

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.396
and train it to
wield the greatest

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:30.535
forces of darkness
imaginable...

00:02:30.568 --> 00:02:35.243
I could shape it into the ideal
vessel to serve as my spare.

00:02:35.277 --> 00:02:36.680
Then, should the time come

00:02:36.714 --> 00:02:39.352
when the Dark King required
me to return his body,

00:02:39.385 --> 00:02:41.289
I'd already have
another great weapon,

00:02:41.323 --> 00:02:43.661
waiting to take its place.

00:02:43.694 --> 00:02:44.963
Hyunckel: A weapon...

00:02:44.997 --> 00:02:47.034
Is that all I
ever was to you?

00:02:47.067 --> 00:02:48.571
A weapon to be wielded?

00:02:48.605 --> 00:02:50.809
Myst: That's right.
You're my weapon.

00:02:50.842 --> 00:02:52.545
A tool. Nothing more.

00:02:52.578 --> 00:02:54.382
There were times
when I was tempted

00:02:54.415 --> 00:02:55.918
to take control of you sooner,

00:02:55.952 --> 00:02:57.589
but I'm glad
I've kept you around.

00:02:57.622 --> 00:03:00.661
In the end, you serve
me - like it or not.

00:03:00.695 --> 00:03:03.032
[cackling]

00:03:03.065 --> 00:03:06.874
[agonized howl]

00:03:06.907 --> 00:03:08.243
Don't give in, Hyunckel!

00:03:08.276 --> 00:03:09.513
Myst: [chuckle]

00:03:09.546 --> 00:03:12.418
I told you, it's too late.
I've found your soul.

00:03:12.451 --> 00:03:15.490
And now, Hyunckel, this is
where you meet your end.

00:03:15.524 --> 00:03:19.165
Unlike that annoying little
girl, when I erase your essence,

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:22.138
I'm going to make sure
that it's permanent.

00:03:22.171 --> 00:03:24.308
Once your vital force
is disintegrated,

00:03:24.342 --> 00:03:26.747
this body will be left
as my living puppet...

00:03:26.781 --> 00:03:29.586
Then, the two of us
shall become one.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.757
My spirit will fuse
with your body,

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.395
creating a warrior whose
unmatched strength

00:03:34.428 --> 00:03:37.769
will rival even that which
I wielded as Mystvearn.

00:03:37.803 --> 00:03:39.004
Consider this an honor...

00:03:39.038 --> 00:03:43.747
In a way, you get to be a
successor to King Vearn himself!

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.622
Myst: This is...

00:03:49.158 --> 00:03:51.863
A-Aura of Light? No, no...

00:03:51.897 --> 00:03:53.132
I don't believe it!

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:54.468
Hyunckel, did you...

00:03:54.502 --> 00:03:57.608
How did you focus Aura of
Light into your own soul?!

00:03:58.243 --> 00:03:59.579
Hyunckel: With my injuries,

00:03:59.612 --> 00:04:02.384
I knew I couldn't move well
enough to fend you off...

00:04:02.418 --> 00:04:04.523
This was all I could
do to stop you.

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:06.092
Myst: But you
couldn't have gathered

00:04:06.126 --> 00:04:07.862
this much energy
in an instant...

00:04:07.895 --> 00:04:10.400
There's no way you
could've prepared for this...

00:04:10.434 --> 00:04:12.170
Not unless you'd
already figured out

00:04:12.204 --> 00:04:14.274
that I was intending
to possess you...

00:04:14.308 --> 00:04:17.481
How could you
possibly know that?!

00:04:18.083 --> 00:04:19.351
I didn't.

00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:21.155
I just had a strange feeling...

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:23.093
that you were going
to choose me.

00:04:23.126 --> 00:04:24.963
So I took precautions.

00:04:24.996 --> 00:04:26.165
Myst: [overwhelmed screech]

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:27.168
Why - you little...

00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:30.608
[screeching]

00:04:38.056 --> 00:04:38.924
Larhart: Hyunckel!

00:04:38.957 --> 00:04:39.860
You all right?

00:04:39.893 --> 00:04:40.961
Where's Myst?

00:04:47.007 --> 00:04:50.915
Hyunckel: He's gone...
I beat him from within.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.554
Crocodine [thought]:
Then the struggle between

00:04:53.587 --> 00:04:55.625
the master of darkness
and his pupil...

00:04:55.658 --> 00:04:57.729
has finally come to an end.

00:04:57.762 --> 00:04:59.465
Hym [thought]:
I hope Myst was happy.

00:04:59.498 --> 00:05:00.668
He got what he wanted:

00:05:00.702 --> 00:05:02.505
To die inside
the "ultimate form"

00:05:02.538 --> 00:05:04.709
he'd been refining
all these years.

00:05:13.928 --> 00:05:15.698
Hyunckel: Master...

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:18.036
I almost don't
want to ask...

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:19.973
But what am I to you?

00:05:21.476 --> 00:05:23.446
Avan: Isn't it obvious?

00:05:24.148 --> 00:05:26.051
You're my friend.

00:05:46.727 --> 00:05:49.298
Come on, Vearn. Why won't
you make your move?

00:05:49.332 --> 00:05:51.469
I thought you said that
this was supposed to be

00:05:51.503 --> 00:05:53.206
your "ultimate" body?

00:05:53.239 --> 00:05:54.909
Just be patient.

00:06:01.255 --> 00:06:02.826
Maam: Master?

00:06:02.859 --> 00:06:05.865
Oh, good. You're up,
Maam. That was close.

00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:08.236
Myst! Where did he...

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:11.075
No need to worry. I don't think
he'll be bothering us again.

00:06:11.108 --> 00:06:13.914
You drove him out of my body
and destroyed him, didn't you?

00:06:13.947 --> 00:06:16.286
You always have a trick
up your sleeve, don't you?

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:17.388
Err...

00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:19.959
Well, actually...

00:06:19.993 --> 00:06:23.099
It was, ahem... well,
something along those lines.

00:06:23.132 --> 00:06:25.738
Of course, I couldn't have done
it without everyone's help.

00:06:25.771 --> 00:06:27.274
You know how these things go.

00:06:27.308 --> 00:06:30.581
[laughing]

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.186
Avan [thought]: I understand.

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:34.689
You'd rather not
let her know about

00:06:34.722 --> 00:06:35.959
your dark
connection with Myst.

00:06:35.992 --> 00:06:38.263
I'll let you tell her
in your own time.

00:06:38.296 --> 00:06:39.833
But make no mistake, Hyunckel.

00:06:39.867 --> 00:06:43.372
I haven't missed it. I can see
how important Maam is to you.

00:06:43.406 --> 00:06:45.745
It's perfectly
clear how you feel.

00:06:45.778 --> 00:06:47.480
Maam: B-But...

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:49.752
But Popp...

00:06:50.855 --> 00:06:53.761
Maam: Popp and
Grand Master, they...

00:06:53.794 --> 00:06:56.198
Myst still killed
both of them.

00:06:59.204 --> 00:07:05.951
[whistling]

00:07:15.938 --> 00:07:18.744
Ah... You were saying,
sleepy head?

00:07:23.186 --> 00:07:24.589
Chiu: Here we go...

00:07:25.157 --> 00:07:26.191
Hm?

00:07:27.427 --> 00:07:28.697
Maam: What... the hell...
are you doing here?

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.901
Popp: Jeez, relax.
Can't you tell?

00:07:30.935 --> 00:07:34.141
We're healing.... This is
healing time, not shouting time.

00:07:34.174 --> 00:07:34.976
[chuckling]

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.680
I may have forgotten
to mention...

00:07:36.713 --> 00:07:38.551
Before I assumed
Killvearn's identity,

00:07:38.584 --> 00:07:41.021
I rescued these two from
Popp's deflected Medroa spell.

00:07:41.055 --> 00:07:42.759
Avan: Once they were
out of harm's way,

00:07:42.792 --> 00:07:45.263
I put on my disguise and
left them both unconscious

00:07:45.296 --> 00:07:46.666
- but alive!

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.104
With all the excitement, I never
got a chance to explain...

00:07:49.137 --> 00:07:51.342
But as you can see,
they're safe and sound.

00:07:51.375 --> 00:07:52.645
Woke up just before you did.

00:07:52.679 --> 00:07:54.415
It's not like they
meant to worry you.

00:07:54.448 --> 00:07:56.252
Honestly, it's
really my mistake.

00:07:56.286 --> 00:07:57.989
Uh, Maam, are you...

00:07:58.022 --> 00:08:00.862
You're not even
listening to me, are you?

00:08:00.895 --> 00:08:03.032
Avan: Maam?
Maam, let's not...

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:05.938
Oh, c'mon. What are you
being all prickly about now?

00:08:05.971 --> 00:08:08.744
Wait, don't tell me. I know.
You're thinking, "It's not fair.

00:08:08.777 --> 00:08:11.215
I should've been the one who
got to heal Popp." Aren't you?

00:08:11.249 --> 00:08:13.052
Yeah, that's it, isn't it?

00:08:17.762 --> 00:08:19.900
Maam: Y-You...
Idiot! Do you...

00:08:19.933 --> 00:08:21.704
M-Maam, take
it easy on him...

00:08:21.737 --> 00:08:22.972
Maam: Have any idea...

00:08:23.005 --> 00:08:24.108
Brokeena: Oh, boy.

00:08:24.141 --> 00:08:26.847
Well, there go all the healing
spells I casted on him.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.750
Are we totally sure
she doesn't still have

00:08:28.784 --> 00:08:30.655
some residual evil in her?

00:08:30.688 --> 00:08:33.326
Nah. She's definitely
back to normal.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.863
They're always like this.

00:08:34.896 --> 00:08:37.835
Chiu: And it's always
Popp's fault, too.

00:08:39.004 --> 00:08:40.708
Speaking of back
to normal, Captain...

00:08:40.741 --> 00:08:42.745
I've got bad news.

00:08:42.779 --> 00:08:44.682
Because it looks like
these Medicinal Herbs

00:08:44.715 --> 00:08:46.887
aren't going to
do a thing for me.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.725
You're sure you can't cast
any Healing-type magic?

00:08:51.262 --> 00:08:52.163
I cannot!

00:08:53.767 --> 00:08:57.107
Okay! Let's get up there
and help Master Dai.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.777
Everyone ready?

00:08:59.478 --> 00:09:01.650
Popp: E-E-Excuse me?

00:09:01.684 --> 00:09:03.987
I think... I might
still need a minute.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.692
All: [sighing]

00:09:05.725 --> 00:09:07.562
Pull yourself together.

00:09:07.595 --> 00:09:09.164
That was a bit much...

00:09:09.198 --> 00:09:13.205
Maam: I know... I mean, I was
just so worried about him.

00:09:13.239 --> 00:09:14.809
He's always such a dummy.

00:09:14.842 --> 00:09:16.713
Has anybody ever told
you that you've got

00:09:16.746 --> 00:09:18.950
a strange way of
expressing relief?

00:09:18.984 --> 00:09:20.855
Let's go, you wimp.
Get up already.

00:09:20.888 --> 00:09:24.161
Popp: Please....
Cast me a Heal spell...

00:09:24.194 --> 00:09:25.731
Maam: Cast it yourself.

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:26.767
On second thought...

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.936
Popp may have a point.

00:09:27.969 --> 00:09:29.104
Anyone who's taken
major damage

00:09:29.138 --> 00:09:31.510
should stay here or head
back to Loroi Valley.

00:09:31.543 --> 00:09:33.212
No. After everything
we've faced,

00:09:33.246 --> 00:09:34.815
there's no going back now.

00:09:34.849 --> 00:09:36.252
Sorry to steal your
line, Hyunckel,

00:09:36.285 --> 00:09:38.924
but I want to see this
battle through to the end.

00:09:38.957 --> 00:09:42.532
Even if it costs you
everything? You sure?

00:09:42.565 --> 00:09:44.936
Truthfully?
I'm afraid to go on.

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.776
Even with Myst in
control of his body,

00:09:47.809 --> 00:09:50.747
Vearn's power was already
close to perfection.

00:09:50.781 --> 00:09:53.854
And up there, he now has
the elder body's Magic Power

00:09:53.887 --> 00:09:56.927
and intellect to go along
with that terrifying might.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.900
Both forms were hard enough to
face when they were apart...

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:01.435
With the pair united again,

00:10:01.468 --> 00:10:03.907
what we're up against
is unimaginable.

00:10:04.976 --> 00:10:06.880
Larhart: Then why
bother going?

00:10:06.914 --> 00:10:09.685
Popp: I could ask you
the same thing, Larhart.

00:10:11.923 --> 00:10:14.796
After all, you couldn't do a
thing to stop Mystvearn either.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:16.198
Don't you remember?

00:10:16.232 --> 00:10:19.271
Knowing that our next opponent's
gonna be even stronger...

00:10:19.304 --> 00:10:21.476
Why would you still go?

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:22.979
A ridiculous question.

00:10:23.012 --> 00:10:25.183
Larhart: I may not be able
to do anything myself,

00:10:25.216 --> 00:10:28.723
but that doesn't matter so long
as Master Dai is victorious.

00:10:28.757 --> 00:10:30.326
If I must perish
for that cause,

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.101
then it's my duty as the last
of the Dragon Masters to do so.

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:37.675
Perhaps I'll just be a
shield for our Hero. So be it.

00:10:37.709 --> 00:10:40.815
That honor alone is all
the reason I need to go.

00:10:40.848 --> 00:10:42.150
Popp: Well, there you have it.

00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:45.858
The rest of us feel
exactly the same way.

00:10:45.891 --> 00:10:48.396
Popp: No one here believes
they can actually face

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:49.933
the Dark King themselves.

00:10:49.966 --> 00:10:53.607
We know this is probably
going to be a one-way trip...

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.713
But, still. We've
made up our minds.

00:10:56.746 --> 00:11:01.221
Win or lose, we're still
going. Besides, it's our duty.

00:11:01.255 --> 00:11:04.896
Dai's up there... and
he'd do the same for us.

00:11:10.674 --> 00:11:11.943
Popp: The way I see it,

00:11:11.976 --> 00:11:14.782
the more shields we can
get him, the better.

00:11:15.584 --> 00:11:17.420
I can't argue with that.

00:11:18.857 --> 00:11:23.032
Then let's move out.
Dai can't wait forever.

00:11:44.742 --> 00:11:47.146
It should only take
another five seconds or so.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:47.882
Dai: Huh?

00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:51.222
Five... Four...
Three... Two...

00:11:51.255 --> 00:11:53.860
One... Zero.

00:12:00.272 --> 00:12:01.976
W-What is that?

00:12:03.714 --> 00:12:05.885
Dai: I'm... I'm
getting stronger...

00:12:05.918 --> 00:12:07.655
Yeah, my body's healing!

00:12:07.688 --> 00:12:08.990
What?

00:12:10.928 --> 00:12:13.199
True Vearn: You should
be fully healed now.

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:16.640
Wait a second. Was that...
Leona's Fullheal spell?

00:12:16.673 --> 00:12:18.343
That's right.

00:12:18.376 --> 00:12:20.280
True Vearn: The Fullheal
she casted on you

00:12:20.313 --> 00:12:23.086
while you were unaffected
by Healing-type magic...

00:12:23.119 --> 00:12:25.624
it has finally taken effect.

00:12:25.658 --> 00:12:29.131
I suspected you would revert to
your lesser form before long,

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:31.569
and it appears as
though I was right.

00:12:31.602 --> 00:12:34.709
When you fight beyond your
limits for extended periods

00:12:34.742 --> 00:12:36.946
using an energy
similar to Dark Aura,

00:12:36.979 --> 00:12:40.419
such backlashes to the body
have been known to occur.

00:12:40.453 --> 00:12:44.260
It is said that weaker beings
can even perish from them.

00:12:44.294 --> 00:12:47.267
The timing will vary, but it's
possible to determine when

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.872
someone will be struck by
this revitalizing blast

00:12:49.906 --> 00:12:52.477
by studying their
eyes and complexion.

00:12:52.512 --> 00:12:55.618
I don't get it. Why did you
wait for that to happen?

00:12:55.651 --> 00:12:58.222
Dai: There's only one reason.

00:12:58.255 --> 00:13:02.130
It's because... he wants to
fight me at full strength.

00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:04.736
What? Why?!

00:13:04.769 --> 00:13:07.541
True Vearn: [laughing]

00:13:07.574 --> 00:13:09.612
You're remarkably
perceptive, Dai.

00:13:09.646 --> 00:13:13.019
It's been a very long while
since I last used this body.

00:13:13.052 --> 00:13:15.122
To crush an enemy
who's not at their best

00:13:15.156 --> 00:13:17.060
would be an utterly
boring endeavor.

00:13:17.093 --> 00:13:19.264
I prefer a little more sport.

00:13:19.297 --> 00:13:21.401
Besides, if you want
to face me like this,

00:13:21.435 --> 00:13:24.843
you'll only be wasting your time
unless you're fully recovered.

00:13:24.876 --> 00:13:26.880
[chuckling]

00:13:26.913 --> 00:13:28.149
Gimme a break!

00:13:28.182 --> 00:13:30.386
You're just trying to
intimidate us, aren't you?

00:13:30.419 --> 00:13:33.960
Threaten all you want.
It won't work on us!

00:13:35.964 --> 00:13:37.467
Leona [thought]:
What's wrong with me?

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.337
I... I can't speak...

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:40.172
Are you kidding?

00:13:40.206 --> 00:13:42.110
All he did was
glare at me, and...

00:13:42.143 --> 00:13:44.782
it's like my body's frozen.

00:13:44.816 --> 00:13:46.418
True Vearn: I assure
you, Princess,

00:13:46.452 --> 00:13:48.924
I'm not trying to
threaten you or show off.

00:13:48.957 --> 00:13:50.260
As a matter of fact...

00:13:50.293 --> 00:13:53.499
I genuinely look forward
to another round against Dai.

00:13:53.533 --> 00:13:55.403
It's bound to be our greatest.

00:13:55.436 --> 00:13:58.008
The Secret Spell of Frozen
Time has been broken...

00:13:58.042 --> 00:14:00.681
Which means, until the
next full solar eclipse,

00:14:00.714 --> 00:14:02.417
a few centuries from now...

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:03.953
I'll be stuck in this form.

00:14:03.987 --> 00:14:05.991
I might as well
make good use of it.

00:14:06.024 --> 00:14:08.162
However, you've taken
these few centuries

00:14:08.196 --> 00:14:10.133
from my immortal lifespan.

00:14:10.166 --> 00:14:12.003
If I don't make
you pay for that,

00:14:12.037 --> 00:14:15.076
then I'll be letting you
get away with robbery.

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:18.617
But before I exact
my price, you may...

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:20.654
amuse me as best as you can.

00:14:20.688 --> 00:14:23.025
Leona [thought]:
He's pure evil.

00:14:25.229 --> 00:14:27.367
I understand where
he's coming from.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.173
You what? Dai, come on.
Don't be stupid.

00:14:30.206 --> 00:14:33.011
What are you even saying here?

00:14:33.045 --> 00:14:34.749
Now that he's taken
his true form,

00:14:34.782 --> 00:14:36.587
he's even stronger
than before.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:37.689
Isn't that right, Vearn?

00:14:37.722 --> 00:14:38.823
Clearly.

00:14:38.857 --> 00:14:41.896
And I mean...
much, much stronger.

00:14:44.602 --> 00:14:45.671
Dai: Being that strong,

00:14:45.704 --> 00:14:47.575
without any challengers
in the world,

00:14:47.608 --> 00:14:49.344
it's just boring.

00:14:49.378 --> 00:14:50.346
I'm not saying that

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.651
I'm looking forward to
this fight like he is...

00:14:52.684 --> 00:14:54.755
But I see where
he's coming from.

00:14:54.788 --> 00:14:57.327
I sorta know how
that feels myself.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.630
But, Dai...

00:14:59.666 --> 00:15:01.268
Yes, you're like me.

00:15:01.301 --> 00:15:03.774
There's no need to
pretend otherwise.

00:15:03.807 --> 00:15:05.009
Descended from warriors,

00:15:05.042 --> 00:15:06.980
your heart beats for
the thrill of battle.

00:15:07.013 --> 00:15:09.819
You can try to hide it,
but no matter what you do,

00:15:09.853 --> 00:15:12.057
your true nature
is undeniable.

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:14.060
The Child of a Dragon
whose foolishness

00:15:14.093 --> 00:15:16.264
drew him to care
for the humans...

00:15:16.298 --> 00:15:19.471
And now I shall tear off that
laughable mask of innocence...

00:15:19.506 --> 00:15:22.444
and bring you torment
beyond your imagining!

00:15:22.477 --> 00:15:25.115
Leona, better hurry
and find some cover.

00:15:26.553 --> 00:15:27.487
It's okay.

00:15:27.521 --> 00:15:30.527
I'm still me and
nothing can change that.

00:15:30.561 --> 00:15:32.497
I'm still everybody's Dai.

00:15:59.151 --> 00:16:00.821
True Vearn: As I've
already told you,

00:16:00.854 --> 00:16:01.990
it's been thousands of years

00:16:02.023 --> 00:16:03.927
since the last time
I fought in this body.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.730
I can't hold back its power,

00:16:05.764 --> 00:16:08.503
so this might be
over rather quickly.

00:16:08.537 --> 00:16:11.141
I hope you'll forgive
me if that's the case.

00:16:11.175 --> 00:16:14.548
Pompous speeches before a
fight aren't really my style.

00:16:17.721 --> 00:16:19.625
Now! Zapple!

00:16:29.679 --> 00:16:30.814
Oh?

00:16:30.847 --> 00:16:33.519
Leona [thought]: That's Giga
Strash! He's going for it.

00:16:38.797 --> 00:16:40.266
I'll just have to use...

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.604
the most powerful
attack that I know!

00:16:43.306 --> 00:16:45.476
[laughing]

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:46.478
Quite correct.

00:16:46.513 --> 00:16:50.019
I do enjoy that about you.
I won't deny that.

00:16:50.052 --> 00:16:52.390
You may be bold, but
you're also rational.

00:16:52.424 --> 00:16:54.695
Although at first glace, it
can seem like recklessness,

00:16:54.729 --> 00:16:58.937
your attacks are always
firmly rooted in logic.

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:00.106
Dai [thought]:
Now that I've seen

00:17:00.139 --> 00:17:01.643
how strong he
is in this form...

00:17:01.676 --> 00:17:03.747
Now that I know our
difference in strength,

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:05.216
there's no doubt about it...

00:17:05.249 --> 00:17:08.089
My strongest attack is the
best way to take him on...

00:17:08.122 --> 00:17:09.458
Maybe the only way...

00:17:09.491 --> 00:17:11.729
Except, it takes
some time to prepare,

00:17:11.763 --> 00:17:13.098
which means it's
gonna be tricky

00:17:13.132 --> 00:17:15.503
to use in a close-quartered
match like this, so...

00:17:15.537 --> 00:17:18.943
This has to be
a head-on approach!

00:17:18.977 --> 00:17:20.614
Very well.
Then, I suppose...

00:17:20.648 --> 00:17:22.317
I should respond in kind,

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:25.590
and show you a skill
worthy of such an attack.

00:17:34.942 --> 00:17:36.579
True Vearn: [chuckling]

00:17:36.613 --> 00:17:38.282
I'm impressed that
you were able sense

00:17:38.315 --> 00:17:40.419
the danger of this
stance so quickly.

00:17:40.452 --> 00:17:44.294
It is called the Demonic
Guard of Heaven and Earth.

00:17:44.327 --> 00:17:46.833
"Demonic Guard of
Heaven and Earth?"

00:17:46.866 --> 00:17:48.904
Leona [thought]: I've
never even heard of that.

00:17:48.937 --> 00:17:50.372
What could it be?

00:17:50.406 --> 00:17:53.278
To my eyes, it seems like he's
merely taken a simple stance...

00:17:53.312 --> 00:17:56.318
No matter how it seems, there's
no way it can be that simple.

00:17:56.352 --> 00:17:57.889
Just look at how
Dai's sweating.

00:17:57.922 --> 00:17:59.458
Whatever's coming, it's big.

00:17:59.491 --> 00:18:01.830
Now, let our greatest
skills clash,

00:18:01.863 --> 00:18:03.432
and when the dust settles...

00:18:03.466 --> 00:18:06.404
We'll see which one of
us was destined to fall.

00:18:07.975 --> 00:18:09.111
True Vearn: What's wrong, Dai?

00:18:09.144 --> 00:18:10.547
Having second thoughts?

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.217
You should know
I wasn't bluffing

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.320
when I said your
judgement was correct.

00:18:14.354 --> 00:18:16.325
When facing my true form,

00:18:16.358 --> 00:18:18.797
your Giga Strash is
indeed the best attack

00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:20.099
to use against me...

00:18:20.133 --> 00:18:22.971
Win or lose,
it's your only chance.

00:18:23.005 --> 00:18:24.273
Dai [thought]: He's right.

00:18:24.307 --> 00:18:28.449
Giga Strash is by far
the strongest attack I know.

00:18:28.482 --> 00:18:32.758
Dai: This is...

00:18:32.791 --> 00:18:34.561
This is my only option.

00:18:34.595 --> 00:18:35.664
Here goes!

00:18:37.968 --> 00:18:39.271
Leona [thought]:
Vearn's not dodging...

00:18:39.304 --> 00:18:41.609
Is he going to try
and take the hit?!

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:46.084
Giga Strash!

00:18:46.118 --> 00:18:47.554
True Vearn: Phoenix Wing!

00:18:48.756 --> 00:18:50.225
Calamitous End!

00:18:50.994 --> 00:18:52.764
Kaiser Phoenix!

00:19:04.722 --> 00:19:06.458
Oh no...

00:19:15.944 --> 00:19:17.313
True Vearn:
While my hand heals,

00:19:17.347 --> 00:19:20.152
allow me to explain what you've
just witnessed, Princess.

00:19:20.186 --> 00:19:23.726
How did I strike
Dai down so easily?

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.966
That's the secret to the Demonic
Guard of Heaven and Earth.

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:30.373
It's all in the name.
"Heaven" represents the attack.

00:19:30.406 --> 00:19:32.143
"Earth" is the defense.

00:19:32.176 --> 00:19:34.080
And "Demonic" symbolizes...

00:19:34.113 --> 00:19:36.585
the use of magical abilities.

00:19:38.122 --> 00:19:39.992
True Vearn: I see
you've put it together.

00:19:40.026 --> 00:19:41.461
When I inhabit this form,

00:19:41.495 --> 00:19:46.237
I can attack, defend, and use
magic all in a single instant.

00:19:46.271 --> 00:19:48.710
The impenetrable stance
which allows me to do so

00:19:48.743 --> 00:19:51.382
is the Demonic Guard
of Heaven and Earth.

00:19:51.415 --> 00:19:52.784
As a withered old man,

00:19:52.818 --> 00:19:55.456
the best I could muster
was two of those three.

00:19:55.489 --> 00:19:58.329
But with my youth and vitality
preserved in this body,

00:19:58.362 --> 00:20:01.168
those limitations
are a thing of the past.

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:03.072
Wielding this ultimate skill,

00:20:03.105 --> 00:20:04.274
it doesn't matter how lethal

00:20:04.307 --> 00:20:06.311
my opponent's
attacks are, either...

00:20:06.344 --> 00:20:09.451
Even Dai's best
became utterly useless.

00:20:09.484 --> 00:20:11.287
Leona [thought]: Of
course he couldn't win.

00:20:11.321 --> 00:20:13.660
Giga Strash is a mix of
magic and attack energy

00:20:13.693 --> 00:20:15.964
that Dai focuses with
his Magic Sword.

00:20:15.998 --> 00:20:18.102
He wasn't expecting
a counterattack

00:20:18.135 --> 00:20:20.541
and a defensive field
at the same time.

00:20:20.574 --> 00:20:22.076
If what he's saying is true,

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.047
anyone who charges
into that stance...

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.886
Their attack would be
neutralized, and simultaneously,

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.224
they'd be torn apart by
the combined strength

00:20:29.257 --> 00:20:31.829
of his brute force
and Magic Power.

00:20:45.524 --> 00:20:47.628
True Vearn : It seems I've
left even the iron-willed

00:20:47.661 --> 00:20:51.135
Princess of Papnica
at a loss for words...

00:20:51.168 --> 00:20:53.873
But what a lovely face.

00:20:53.906 --> 00:20:55.142
Dai: S-Stop it.

00:20:55.176 --> 00:20:56.412
Hm?

00:20:56.445 --> 00:20:58.650
Dai: Get... away from her...

00:20:58.683 --> 00:21:00.385
I'm warning you!

00:21:14.581 --> 00:21:16.117
True Vearn: You may
have thought you were

00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:18.421
shielded by your
Draconic Aura,

00:21:18.455 --> 00:21:21.929
however, there's nothing
my Calamitous End can't cut.

00:21:21.963 --> 00:21:23.332
Not a blade in this realm

00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:25.870
can match a strike from
the side of my palm.

00:21:26.773 --> 00:21:29.979
True Vearn: I wonder
if you realize...

00:21:30.012 --> 00:21:32.551
I've left that wound
in exactly the same place

00:21:32.584 --> 00:21:35.355
as the one you
inflicted upon me.

00:21:35.389 --> 00:21:37.326
True Vearn: Measure for
measure, as they say.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.567
Now to make you burn in
the fire of my wrath.

00:21:41.368 --> 00:21:42.804
Let's see.

00:21:42.838 --> 00:21:46.779
Yes, I think I've come up with
a very entertaining proposal.

00:21:46.812 --> 00:21:48.315
Princess Leona...

00:21:48.348 --> 00:21:51.989
I'll spare you... if you
agree to serve by my side.

00:23:37.601 --> 00:23:39.337
Narrator: After using
his terrifying skill

00:23:39.371 --> 00:23:40.974
to foil Dai's Giga Strash;

00:23:41.008 --> 00:23:43.546
The Dark King sets
his gaze upon Leona,

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:45.684
intending to persuade
her to stand by his side

00:23:45.717 --> 00:23:47.721
and break our Hero's spirit.

00:23:47.754 --> 00:23:49.625
But when he meets
fierce resistance,

00:23:49.658 --> 00:23:52.363
the first cracks begin
to form in Vearn.

00:23:52.396 --> 00:23:54.166
Peril threatens to
close its jaws

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.737
around Dai for
the last time...

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:57.907
until Popp and
the others intervene.

00:23:57.941 --> 00:24:00.212
See how it all unfolds -
next time on

00:24:00.245 --> 00:24:02.851
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:02.884 --> 00:24:04.453
"The Eye Jewel."
