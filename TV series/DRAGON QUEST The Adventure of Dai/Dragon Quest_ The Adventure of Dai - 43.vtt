WEBVTT

00:01:50.688 --> 00:01:53.326
Dai [thought]:
My sword realizes it!

00:01:55.197 --> 00:01:56.934
[roaring]

00:01:56.967 --> 00:02:00.140
Hey - Don't burn all the energy
from your Dragon Crest.

00:02:00.173 --> 00:02:02.345
You've got to pace
yourself, Dai!

00:02:02.378 --> 00:02:05.183
He's not the Hadlar we knew!

00:02:05.216 --> 00:02:08.557
Dai: If I don't use my
full strength - it's over!

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.732
Yes! Brilliant observation.

00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:15.771
You are worthy of battle!

00:02:39.018 --> 00:02:40.856
End of the road...

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.226
For Avan's Disciples.

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.413
Popp: H-Hadlar's
completely transformed.

00:03:10.446 --> 00:03:12.985
He's more than
just some monster!

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.327
That looks... familiar!

00:03:39.138 --> 00:03:41.844
He's a... Superior Being!

00:03:41.877 --> 00:03:43.514
Popp: W-What?!

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.185
Dai: Zamza's research...

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:48.891
he used it to mutate
himself into this.

00:03:49.793 --> 00:03:51.730
Didn't you, Hadlar?!

00:03:51.763 --> 00:03:54.602
Why not find out
yourself, little hero?

00:03:54.636 --> 00:03:56.439
Just summon up
that courage...

00:03:56.472 --> 00:03:58.443
Then come and fight me.

00:03:58.477 --> 00:04:00.548
Experience
the kind of power

00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:04.956
one can only obtain
with great sacrifice!

00:04:09.566 --> 00:04:11.804
Hadlar: You'll
soon realize...

00:04:11.837 --> 00:04:17.582
That every formidable enemy
you've ever fought and bested...

00:04:17.615 --> 00:04:21.388
...is now nothing
compared to me!

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.564
[pained yell]

00:04:39.025 --> 00:04:40.326
Dai!

00:04:49.545 --> 00:04:51.015
Dai [thought]:
That's impossible.

00:04:51.048 --> 00:04:54.188
I blocked him with the crest
power focused into my hand...

00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:56.960
But I don't feel it anymore!

00:04:56.994 --> 00:04:59.064
I can't draw my
sword like this.

00:05:02.238 --> 00:05:04.007
[roaring]

00:05:08.817 --> 00:05:09.953
Hadlar: Boom!

00:05:13.192 --> 00:05:14.361
[pained yell]

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.814
A... A spell?

00:05:23.848 --> 00:05:24.950
But how?!

00:05:24.983 --> 00:05:27.822
The last Superior Being
we fought couldn't use magic!

00:05:37.173 --> 00:05:38.711
Stop, Hadlar!

00:05:38.744 --> 00:05:40.814
Killvearn:
How about you "stop"?

00:05:42.886 --> 00:05:47.227
Killvearn: Easy.
We're at a ceasefire for now.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.199
Out of respect
for Commander Hadlar.

00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:55.511
After all, this is a one-on-one
duel between him and Dai.

00:05:55.545 --> 00:05:58.449
Oh, get real.
This is not a duel!

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:01.489
You and Mystvearn-
you lured us into a trap!

00:06:01.523 --> 00:06:03.894
Killvearn: If you say so,
but aren't you a teensy,

00:06:03.928 --> 00:06:06.967
weensy bit interested
in seeing this play out?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.541
Killvearn: Hadlar has
abandoned his Darkling species.

00:06:10.574 --> 00:06:14.081
He's given up his entire
identity for this battle.

00:06:16.085 --> 00:06:16.820
"Given up"?

00:06:16.853 --> 00:06:18.524
Oh, I understand!

00:06:18.558 --> 00:06:21.295
In order to use magic
while in this new form-

00:06:21.328 --> 00:06:23.165
he had to permanently
give up the ability

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:26.574
to turn himself back into
a Darkling, isn't that right?

00:06:26.607 --> 00:06:28.677
And that means
Lord Hadlar is going to be

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.917
stuck in that monstrous
body of his forever!

00:06:31.951 --> 00:06:33.386
[laughing]

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:34.723
Killvearn: That's right.

00:06:34.756 --> 00:06:37.160
It's a bit embarrassing,
but as a result,

00:06:37.193 --> 00:06:39.699
he's only gotten
a little stronger.

00:06:41.269 --> 00:06:42.773
Yup, yup, yup, master.

00:06:42.806 --> 00:06:46.078
Popp [thought]:
Only a "little" stronger?

00:06:46.112 --> 00:06:47.314
Are you kidding me?!

00:06:47.347 --> 00:06:50.555
A Superior Being
that can cast spells...

00:06:50.588 --> 00:06:53.860
What are we supposed
to do up against that?!

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.039
Hadlar: I no longer
care for my Darkling body.

00:07:00.073 --> 00:07:03.213
In fact, when I finally
gave it up for good...

00:07:03.246 --> 00:07:06.485
I felt all of my
foolish pride and ego

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.524
slip away into
nothingness...

00:07:08.557 --> 00:07:11.495
And I became a vessel.

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:14.703
There is no Hadlar-
there is only the darkness.

00:07:14.736 --> 00:07:17.474
The individual
is not victorious.

00:07:17.508 --> 00:07:18.878
And that...

00:07:18.911 --> 00:07:23.854
Is a lesson from my
nemesis - Avan the Hero!

00:07:29.464 --> 00:07:30.801
[flying yell]

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:32.938
Dai [thought]:
He's strong...

00:07:32.972 --> 00:07:36.445
Not only that, he's more
determined than ever before.

00:07:36.478 --> 00:07:39.418
I can't beat him
without my sword.

00:07:39.452 --> 00:07:42.591
I need to draw it
with my left hand somehow!

00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:55.049
[charging roar]

00:07:57.889 --> 00:07:59.625
[roaring]

00:08:07.942 --> 00:08:08.910
Boom!

00:08:11.282 --> 00:08:13.085
Wave Slash!

00:08:26.913 --> 00:08:28.115
Hadlar: Ah...

00:08:32.926 --> 00:08:36.566
So, this is what that new
blade of yours is capable of...

00:08:40.073 --> 00:08:41.543
Very well.

00:08:41.577 --> 00:08:44.716
Your next attack shall
test our little theory;

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.855
Whether the raw power
of my Supreme fist...

00:08:47.888 --> 00:08:51.930
could beat a legendary weapon.
This should be interesting.

00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:55.336
Popp: He's got something
up his sleeve... but...

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:58.744
How could he have something
stronger than those claws?!

00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:00.480
No way.

00:09:00.514 --> 00:09:02.017
Dai's new sword is destructive

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.921
in a way no one's
ever seen before-

00:09:03.954 --> 00:09:06.359
There's no way he
can lose with it.

00:09:06.392 --> 00:09:07.562
Whatever Hadlar's got...

00:09:07.595 --> 00:09:09.966
Whatever secret attack
he has planned...

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.473
It'll never be stronger than
the Sword of Dai - it won't!

00:09:13.507 --> 00:09:15.611
Killvearn: [chuckling]

00:09:21.422 --> 00:09:23.326
Hurry and finish
him off, Dai!

00:09:23.359 --> 00:09:24.696
Remember the last time?

00:09:24.729 --> 00:09:27.602
Superior Beings are able to
regenerate during battle!

00:09:27.635 --> 00:09:29.505
Dai [thought]:
I remember, Popp.

00:09:29.539 --> 00:09:31.876
And I intend to finish it.

00:09:33.379 --> 00:09:36.886
Good. The feeling's
coming back!

00:09:42.463 --> 00:09:44.334
Draconic Aura!

00:09:49.145 --> 00:09:50.346
Killvearn: That's...

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.883
Can it be?

00:09:57.628 --> 00:10:00.033
Ah, the Strash.

00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:01.435
Killvearn:
The attack that cleaved

00:10:01.469 --> 00:10:05.578
Sovereign Rock Castle in half
was probably Earth Slash.

00:10:05.611 --> 00:10:08.751
And he just used Wave Slash.

00:10:08.784 --> 00:10:11.022
This will be the
first time the boy has used

00:10:11.055 --> 00:10:14.663
Avan Strash with
that new blade of his.

00:10:14.696 --> 00:10:17.935
I bet you think you've
got this one in the bag, huh?

00:10:17.969 --> 00:10:21.510
Well, I'm about to release a
strike with all of my power.

00:10:21.543 --> 00:10:22.945
Let's see you beat that!

00:10:23.547 --> 00:10:24.782
Then try it.

00:10:24.816 --> 00:10:26.853
If you're right about
this power of yours...

00:10:26.886 --> 00:10:30.126
I doubt I'll be able
to survive a direct hit.

00:10:30.694 --> 00:10:31.997
But - know this;

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:35.202
If I live,
it will be your end!

00:10:35.236 --> 00:10:39.245
You, a Dragon Knight, are
meant to be a divine creation-

00:10:39.278 --> 00:10:40.748
an ultimate being!

00:10:40.781 --> 00:10:43.285
And if you are to fail?

00:10:44.756 --> 00:10:46.860
My superiority
will be tested-

00:10:46.893 --> 00:10:50.701
and I will have surpassed
the strength of a god!

00:10:54.809 --> 00:10:57.481
Killvearn: He seems pretty
confident, doesn't he?

00:10:57.515 --> 00:10:58.751
This is exciting.

00:10:58.784 --> 00:11:00.955
Dai [thought]: I won't lose.

00:11:00.988 --> 00:11:03.927
Not while I have
the Sword of Dai.

00:11:04.729 --> 00:11:07.735
No matter who I face!

00:11:07.768 --> 00:11:09.972
I can't lose!

00:11:13.245 --> 00:11:14.315
Here goes, Hadlar.

00:11:14.348 --> 00:11:15.383
Come on!

00:11:16.586 --> 00:11:18.055
Avan...

00:11:18.657 --> 00:11:20.794
Strash!

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.710
Popp: What happened?!

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:44.742
No... But how?!

00:11:47.849 --> 00:11:50.721
That was a direct hit
from Dai's new sword,

00:11:50.755 --> 00:11:52.592
and there isn't
even a scratch?

00:11:52.625 --> 00:11:54.762
Is his... Is his body...

00:11:54.795 --> 00:11:57.133
Even harder than Orichalcum?!

00:12:00.006 --> 00:12:02.579
Dai: Th-That's not it...

00:12:02.612 --> 00:12:04.683
I... felt the impact...

00:12:04.716 --> 00:12:07.253
Of metal on metal, somehow!

00:12:09.124 --> 00:12:09.693
[chuckling]

00:12:09.726 --> 00:12:10.828
Yes, that's right.

00:12:10.861 --> 00:12:12.899
You know I
have one, too, Dai.

00:12:12.932 --> 00:12:16.171
A legendary weapon
may be equal to yours.

00:12:16.205 --> 00:12:17.440
Don't you remember?

00:12:18.577 --> 00:12:20.814
It's called the
Sword of Champions.

00:12:22.351 --> 00:12:24.388
Sword of Champions?

00:12:24.421 --> 00:12:25.524
Right - I forgot!

00:12:25.558 --> 00:12:27.661
Zamza stole it
and gave it to him!

00:12:27.695 --> 00:12:29.265
Yes.

00:12:29.298 --> 00:12:32.370
The real one this time.

00:12:32.403 --> 00:12:34.341
Let me show you.

00:12:41.522 --> 00:12:43.994
The sword and I
are joined as one!

00:12:47.534 --> 00:12:48.503
[shocked gasp]

00:13:02.497 --> 00:13:04.234
Hadlar: [roaring]

00:13:06.405 --> 00:13:08.810
[struggling grunts]

00:13:08.843 --> 00:13:11.516
Gah, that's hot!

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:14.421
Killvearn: There's something
about this Dark Aura...

00:13:14.454 --> 00:13:16.225
Mystvearn: Dark Fire Energy.

00:13:16.258 --> 00:13:17.529
What is that?!

00:13:17.562 --> 00:13:18.997
What do you think, kid?

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.401
Dark, en, er, gy!

00:13:21.435 --> 00:13:22.705
The Dark Fire kind!

00:13:22.739 --> 00:13:27.381
It burns life energy down until
its reduced to nothing, y'see!

00:13:27.414 --> 00:13:28.983
Just watch!

00:13:35.831 --> 00:13:37.935
Hadlar: I can
tell from that strike.

00:13:37.969 --> 00:13:39.772
My strength as
a superior being

00:13:39.805 --> 00:13:42.177
is comparable to
a Dragon Knight's!

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:43.046
And with this...

00:13:43.079 --> 00:13:45.182
Legendary weapon of mine...

00:13:45.216 --> 00:13:48.422
My ability may
be even greater!

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:54.300
No - Dai!

00:13:56.038 --> 00:13:57.675
But I refuse to hold back.

00:13:57.708 --> 00:14:01.783
To dilute my own abilities
in a fight like this one...

00:14:01.816 --> 00:14:04.890
It would be
disrespectful to both of us.

00:14:04.923 --> 00:14:06.727
Now - take this, Dai...

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.831
One last, all-out attack...

00:14:08.864 --> 00:14:13.506
With the Sword of Champions!

00:14:18.584 --> 00:14:20.754
[roaring]

00:14:20.787 --> 00:14:21.857
Hadlar: Ultra...

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:24.795
Combustion Slash!

00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:27.133
Mystvearn: "Ultra
Combustion Slash"?!

00:14:27.167 --> 00:14:29.137
Killvearn: Not a bad idea.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.976
By using Dark Fire Energy
along with his sword,

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:35.851
the power of his attack is
amplified to an extreme degree.

00:14:35.884 --> 00:14:37.420
Oh, wow! Cool!

00:14:37.453 --> 00:14:39.357
Dai, run for it!

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.128
Don't get hit!

00:14:43.032 --> 00:14:46.038
Dai [thought]:
I-I can't. It's too late.

00:14:46.071 --> 00:14:49.310
I have to defend
with my Draconic Aura!

00:14:53.419 --> 00:14:54.989
But it's too weak!

00:14:58.195 --> 00:14:59.632
Perish!

00:15:04.542 --> 00:15:08.348
Killvearn: Oh, my.
Is that really the end?

00:15:11.088 --> 00:15:13.593
No! Look up there.

00:15:15.965 --> 00:15:17.668
Hadlar: A Zoom spell.

00:15:17.702 --> 00:15:20.306
That ridiculous
mage interfered.

00:15:22.778 --> 00:15:26.184
Cheater! Cheater!
Oh... Cheater!

00:15:29.926 --> 00:15:31.428
They're running?!

00:15:31.462 --> 00:15:32.664
Come back!

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.304
I don't think so...
Just watch.

00:15:49.164 --> 00:15:52.003
Wow! He is super fast!

00:15:52.036 --> 00:15:53.640
Killvearn: Let's follow them.

00:15:58.783 --> 00:16:01.789
I never thought I'd see
the day I get called a cheater

00:16:01.822 --> 00:16:04.194
by a bunch of
freaks like them.

00:16:04.962 --> 00:16:06.833
But, Popp...

00:16:06.867 --> 00:16:08.604
Why?

00:16:08.637 --> 00:16:11.108
Dai, let's face it...

00:16:11.141 --> 00:16:13.012
Hadlar can't be beat.

00:16:13.045 --> 00:16:15.149
Not if you fight him alone.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.422
Every time we fought...

00:16:18.456 --> 00:16:23.032
He would give in to his emotions
and begin to lose control.

00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:26.572
Popp: That's why even I
was able to match him somehow.

00:16:28.375 --> 00:16:31.716
But now, Hadlar has changed!

00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:35.289
He isn't just stronger than
he's ever been before, is he?

00:16:35.322 --> 00:16:37.929
His mind is...
focused, as well.

00:16:37.962 --> 00:16:39.999
He's calculating every move.

00:16:40.032 --> 00:16:41.468
Unlike before.

00:16:42.538 --> 00:16:44.608
At least... That's
what it seemed like.

00:16:45.811 --> 00:16:46.411
Dai: But...

00:16:46.444 --> 00:16:47.347
Popp: Enough.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.785
We're going back to Papnica.

00:16:49.819 --> 00:16:53.760
Don't forget you literally cut
a castle in half earlier today.

00:16:55.129 --> 00:16:57.133
Here we go.

00:16:57.467 --> 00:16:58.402
Zoom!

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:02.878
Popp [thought]: Oh, no.

00:17:02.911 --> 00:17:05.382
I've used up
all my magic power.

00:17:06.185 --> 00:17:08.255
Popp? What happened?

00:17:09.625 --> 00:17:10.828
Don't you worry!

00:17:10.861 --> 00:17:12.531
Let's just get as
far away from here

00:17:12.564 --> 00:17:14.735
as we can with
a Levizoom spell!

00:17:18.142 --> 00:17:20.279
Hadlar: Where do
you think you're going?

00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:22.685
You're headed East, Popp.

00:17:22.718 --> 00:17:25.489
You know that's not
the way back, don't you?

00:17:53.847 --> 00:17:56.586
Zaboera: [cackling]

00:17:56.619 --> 00:17:57.320
That's right.

00:17:57.354 --> 00:17:59.124
How do the two of you like

00:17:59.157 --> 00:18:01.863
my flawless Superior
Being creation, eh?!

00:18:01.897 --> 00:18:08.242
If he defeats Dai, it will mean
he surpassed a Dragon Knight.

00:18:08.276 --> 00:18:12.652
He will be greater than
a god-created warrior...

00:18:12.685 --> 00:18:16.525
Meaning that I too
have surpassed the gods.

00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:21.135
Surely it's safe to say
that now, I am a god myself!

00:18:21.168 --> 00:18:24.307
[prideful cackle]

00:18:26.478 --> 00:18:28.415
Hadlar [thought]:
Interesting.

00:18:28.448 --> 00:18:33.527
He can already use Levizoom
without the help of his crest.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.699
I can't take my eyes
off him for a second.

00:18:37.902 --> 00:18:43.780
[panting]

00:18:43.813 --> 00:18:44.414
Dai...

00:18:44.448 --> 00:18:47.855
Don't... Don't you do it!

00:18:47.888 --> 00:18:50.159
Dai [thought]: Popp, run...

00:18:50.192 --> 00:18:51.730
While I'm keeping him busy!

00:18:51.763 --> 00:18:53.834
Your crest has faded...

00:18:53.867 --> 00:18:55.436
And that means...

00:18:55.469 --> 00:18:58.743
your Draconic Aura
must also be gone.

00:19:03.987 --> 00:19:06.625
It looks like I win!

00:19:08.996 --> 00:19:10.399
Dai [thought]:
I have to attack.

00:19:10.433 --> 00:19:12.738
Staying on the defensive
with this little energy

00:19:12.771 --> 00:19:15.744
won't be enough for
another attack from him.

00:19:16.177 --> 00:19:18.282
It's over, Dai!

00:19:18.315 --> 00:19:19.317
Dai [thought]: Anything!

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:20.654
Some sort of attack that uses

00:19:20.687 --> 00:19:23.593
whatever I have
left all at once!

00:19:24.194 --> 00:19:26.599
Ultra Combustion Slash!

00:19:41.261 --> 00:19:42.430
Piroro: L-Look!

00:19:46.005 --> 00:19:46.872
Dai!

00:19:52.383 --> 00:19:56.324
N-No! Where did he go?

00:19:59.932 --> 00:20:01.067
Dai!

00:20:01.101 --> 00:20:02.103
Popp: Dai!

00:20:02.136 --> 00:20:03.706
No, c'mon...

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:04.842
Dai!

00:20:14.127 --> 00:20:15.295
Popp: Dai!

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:24.247
This can't be happening.

00:20:24.715 --> 00:20:25.383
Dai's sword was...

00:20:25.416 --> 00:20:28.189
was supposed to be unrivaled!

00:20:28.222 --> 00:20:30.359
Please, c'mon, buddy...

00:20:30.392 --> 00:20:32.063
Get back here.

00:20:32.096 --> 00:20:34.601
Just get back here and fight!

00:20:35.469 --> 00:20:37.507
He defeated the Hero?

00:20:37.541 --> 00:20:39.645
Killvearn: Both of them
having weapons made from

00:20:39.679 --> 00:20:42.584
Orichalcum certainly
evened the match.

00:20:42.617 --> 00:20:44.655
But in terms of
physical strength,

00:20:44.688 --> 00:20:48.428
a Superior Being
is more powerful.

00:20:48.461 --> 00:20:51.134
This is probably
Hadlar's victory.

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:54.440
It's no fair.
He's hogging all the glory.

00:21:01.387 --> 00:21:02.724
Popp: Hadlar!

00:21:04.127 --> 00:21:05.229
Killvearn: Called it.

00:21:05.262 --> 00:21:07.767
Hadlar... is victorious.

00:21:30.312 --> 00:21:32.383
Just like a true Hero.

00:21:32.417 --> 00:21:34.621
The boy didn't disappoint.

00:21:42.838 --> 00:21:44.341
Hadlar?

00:21:44.374 --> 00:21:46.411
It... was a draw?!

00:21:49.351 --> 00:21:51.421
Killvearn: Myst,
go and see to

00:21:51.454 --> 00:21:53.893
our good friend
Hadlar, would you?

00:21:54.762 --> 00:21:56.431
Meanwhile...

00:21:57.801 --> 00:22:00.773
I will take
care of the mage.

00:23:37.768 --> 00:23:39.639
Narrator: With the
battle ended in a draw

00:23:39.672 --> 00:23:41.809
and Dai swallowed
up by the frigid sea,

00:23:41.842 --> 00:23:44.815
a wounded Hadlar
leaves the battlefield.

00:23:44.848 --> 00:23:47.353
Meanwhile, Popp
searches desperately for

00:23:47.387 --> 00:23:48.656
his fallen comrade,

00:23:48.689 --> 00:23:51.663
but the Reaper Killvearn
is hot on his heels.

00:23:51.696 --> 00:23:53.900
Will Popp manage to survive?

00:23:53.933 --> 00:23:56.171
And what will become
of our hero's fate?

00:23:56.204 --> 00:23:57.708
Find out on
the next episode of

00:23:57.741 --> 00:24:00.279
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

"The Hero Lost
in the Glacier".
