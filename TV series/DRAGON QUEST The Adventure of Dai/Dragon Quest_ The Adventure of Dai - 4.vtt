WEBVTT

00:02:18.176 --> 00:02:20.982
Hadlar: A shield
around the island.

00:02:21.015 --> 00:02:23.654
He's always been clever.

00:02:25.858 --> 00:02:27.395
Here we go-

00:02:27.428 --> 00:02:28.463
Puff!

00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:35.276
[roaring]

00:02:36.513 --> 00:02:38.951
Dai: A dragon?
That really is some spell.

00:02:38.984 --> 00:02:40.354
It's called Puff!

00:02:40.387 --> 00:02:43.928
It's an ancient mythical
battle enchantment.

00:02:43.961 --> 00:02:45.932
I never thought
I'd see it myself.

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:49.071
He's bigger than the one
from the Golden Cylinder.

00:02:49.104 --> 00:02:51.042
Avan: Dragons are
the most powerful

00:02:51.075 --> 00:02:53.046
in all of the monster kingdom.

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.120
Only a true Hero could face
such a creature and survive...

00:02:57.154 --> 00:02:59.425
Let alone defeat it!

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.797
Avan: It's time to
prove yourself, Dai.

00:03:03.834 --> 00:03:06.138
Brass: This is too dangerous!

00:03:06.172 --> 00:03:08.042
Stay back, Grampa! Please.

00:03:08.076 --> 00:03:09.612
[roaring]

00:03:16.727 --> 00:03:18.363
Avan: I warned you...

00:03:18.396 --> 00:03:21.770
Dragon's skin is harder
than Papnica steel.

00:03:21.803 --> 00:03:22.739
Fine, then...

00:03:22.773 --> 00:03:24.976
Guess I'm gonna to
have to play rough.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.913
How about an Earth Slash!

00:03:26.947 --> 00:03:29.953
Avan: You won't win this battle
with brute strength alone!

00:03:29.986 --> 00:03:31.322
[pained yell]

00:03:32.058 --> 00:03:33.126
Dai!

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.837
[panicked chirping]

00:03:47.355 --> 00:03:49.659
No, no. That's not right.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.196
[startled yelp]

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:52.331
What's with you?!

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:54.202
Don't scare me like that!

00:03:54.235 --> 00:03:55.671
Look - just relax.

00:03:55.705 --> 00:03:57.575
I'm not training
to compete with Dai

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.879
or anything dumb,
all right?

00:03:59.913 --> 00:04:02.786
I want to be absolutely
clear on that point...

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.125
I don't know what sorta crazy
training he's doing today...

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.797
[chirping]

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.369
Master Avan...

00:04:11.402 --> 00:04:12.839
What about him, little guy?

00:04:14.308 --> 00:04:14.977
[shocked gasp]

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.811
What?!

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:18.851
He didn't!

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.259
How could he really
think that's a good idea?

00:04:23.293 --> 00:04:25.798
Dai can barely even cast
a simple Crack spell!

00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:29.037
There's no way he'll be able
to stop Dragon's fire so soon!

00:04:30.842 --> 00:04:31.710
Brass: Dai!

00:04:31.744 --> 00:04:32.980
I'm fine.

00:04:33.013 --> 00:04:34.682
Listen, that's enough!

00:04:35.818 --> 00:04:37.889
I've got this, Grampa.

00:04:39.526 --> 00:04:41.964
Dai [thought]: That Earth Slash
didn't even leave a scratch...

00:04:41.997 --> 00:04:44.802
I'll need something else if
I want to beat Dragon's fire.

00:04:44.836 --> 00:04:49.178
Avan: Slice the earth, slice
the sea, and slice the air.

00:04:49.211 --> 00:04:51.315
The Avan Style Sword Technique

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:54.355
uses these three elements
as its foundation.

00:04:54.388 --> 00:04:56.560
Yesterday, you acquired
the Earth Slash,

00:04:56.593 --> 00:04:58.764
so you've mastered
slicing solid objects...

00:04:58.797 --> 00:05:01.737
Now it's time for you
to learn your next attack:

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:02.972
the Wave Slash.

00:05:03.006 --> 00:05:05.310
Agility is the
key to this one.

00:05:05.344 --> 00:05:08.650
It takes great speed
to slice the sea.

00:05:08.684 --> 00:05:11.289
A water attack should
put out a fire, right?

00:05:11.322 --> 00:05:13.359
Well, let's give it a shot...

00:05:13.392 --> 00:05:14.929
Slice the sea!

00:05:22.444 --> 00:05:25.083
Dai: Avan Style
Sword Technique...

00:05:26.586 --> 00:05:28.758
Avan: Ah, I see
you're catching on...

00:05:28.791 --> 00:05:31.730
You've got the wits,
but do you have the speed?

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:35.103
Popp: Oh, boy...

00:05:35.137 --> 00:05:36.974
[snarling]

00:05:37.007 --> 00:05:38.544
Popp: Dai - don't do it!

00:05:41.482 --> 00:05:43.052
Now! Wave Slash!

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.025
Stop!

00:05:49.666 --> 00:05:52.137
Popp: He sliced
through the fire?!

00:05:55.844 --> 00:06:01.824
[pained roar]

00:06:01.857 --> 00:06:05.798
[whimpering]

00:06:05.831 --> 00:06:07.100
Oh, Master...

00:06:08.704 --> 00:06:09.471
Dai!

00:06:14.448 --> 00:06:15.584
Told you I had it.

00:06:15.617 --> 00:06:17.722
You okay over there,
Master Avan?

00:06:20.293 --> 00:06:21.563
Avan: It really stings.

00:06:21.596 --> 00:06:24.001
You're lucky that's
all the damage, sir...

00:06:24.034 --> 00:06:27.308
Isn't using Puff for
training a little extreme?

00:06:27.341 --> 00:06:29.779
Popp: You could've
burned Dai to a crisp.

00:06:30.413 --> 00:06:31.783
Avan: It was a risk...

00:06:31.817 --> 00:06:34.287
But didn't you notice how when
Dai defeated that Gargoyle

00:06:34.321 --> 00:06:35.858
he also managed
to split the ocean?

00:06:35.892 --> 00:06:38.697
Well, it gave me a hunch
that he might be able to

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.100
pull off Wave Slash right away.

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:42.939
You can't just risk
somebody's life on a hunch!

00:06:42.972 --> 00:06:45.978
Avan: Well, I'm the one
who almost lost his nose.

00:06:46.012 --> 00:06:48.517
Were you really that
worried about Dai?

00:06:49.218 --> 00:06:54.461
No... Of course not.

00:06:54.495 --> 00:06:56.633
If Earth Slash was
a test of strength,

00:06:56.667 --> 00:06:58.804
then Wave Slash was
one of speed...

00:06:58.838 --> 00:07:00.942
Avan: You already had
both in spades, Dai...

00:07:00.975 --> 00:07:03.045
But all your hard work
these past few days

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:05.618
seems to be taking you
to a whole new level.

00:07:05.651 --> 00:07:07.655
So the attack that
cuts through water

00:07:07.688 --> 00:07:10.026
can also smother
a fire, huh?

00:07:10.059 --> 00:07:12.899
Yes, sir. Wave Slash works
on anything formless.

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:15.103
Fire's just as
formless as water.

00:07:15.136 --> 00:07:16.305
Correct!

00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:19.177
A warrior who masters this
skill can fend off his enemies

00:07:19.211 --> 00:07:23.052
by slashing everything from
an inferno to blizzard.

00:07:23.086 --> 00:07:24.288
This is incredible.

00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:26.392
No one's ever
learned it so quickly.

00:07:26.425 --> 00:07:27.394
At this rate...

00:07:27.427 --> 00:07:28.998
I'm certain that
Dai will complete

00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:30.768
the Special Hard Course!

00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:34.375
[pained cry]

00:07:34.408 --> 00:07:35.711
Avan: It still stings!

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:37.615
Maybe you should ice it.

00:07:37.648 --> 00:07:39.485
A mild Crack spell would work.

00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:41.724
Avan: Good thinking.
Perhaps Dai should cast it.

00:07:41.757 --> 00:07:44.494
Yeah! He needs the practice.

00:07:47.167 --> 00:07:48.202
Dai: Crack!

00:07:53.313 --> 00:07:55.283
Avan: A very nice size, too!

00:07:55.317 --> 00:07:57.154
Dai: Just "nice"?
What are you saying?

00:07:57.187 --> 00:08:00.059
[chuckling]

00:08:00.093 --> 00:08:03.734
Avan: I must say, I'm quite
embarrassed with myself.

00:08:03.768 --> 00:08:06.105
So, what brings
you here Popp...

00:08:06.138 --> 00:08:07.608
Have you decided to join us?

00:08:07.642 --> 00:08:11.916
Uh, this thing dragged
me here against my will.

00:08:14.088 --> 00:08:16.860
Dai: What? You found him
training all by himself?

00:08:16.893 --> 00:08:17.428
Come on.

00:08:17.461 --> 00:08:18.496
Don't!

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.602
Dai: Really? He thinks
you're jealous.

00:08:20.635 --> 00:08:22.003
Popp: Hey! Knock it off!

00:08:22.036 --> 00:08:24.141
I told you-
it's not about that!

00:08:24.175 --> 00:08:25.811
[laughing]

00:08:29.051 --> 00:08:30.153
[startled grunts]

00:08:31.322 --> 00:08:32.323
Earthquake?

00:08:32.357 --> 00:08:34.361
It might be a
volcanic eruption...

00:08:34.395 --> 00:08:36.232
No. Something worse.

00:08:36.265 --> 00:08:37.935
It's the magic circle...

00:08:38.971 --> 00:08:40.708
Someone must be
trying to breach it,

00:08:40.741 --> 00:08:43.614
and whoever it is,
they're incredibly powerful.

00:08:43.647 --> 00:08:44.715
Both: What?!

00:08:53.433 --> 00:08:54.836
But who could it be?

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.906
Well, that's pretty
obvious, isn't it?

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.677
The dark lord's
henchmen must be

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.048
losing their
patience out there.

00:09:01.081 --> 00:09:03.587
Popp: The magic circle
only repels the bad guys!

00:09:03.621 --> 00:09:04.756
Avan: He's right...

00:09:04.789 --> 00:09:05.925
But an ordinary monster

00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.295
wouldn't be able to
set foot inside it...

00:09:09.431 --> 00:09:10.701
Could it be?

00:09:18.283 --> 00:09:20.086
Uh... Did they give up?

00:09:20.487 --> 00:09:21.189
It's coming.

00:09:21.222 --> 00:09:22.390
Huh?!

00:09:22.424 --> 00:09:23.994
It's something
really strong...

00:09:24.027 --> 00:09:26.567
And it definitely doesn't
feel like a good guy.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.572
Brass: [groaning]

00:09:29.606 --> 00:09:31.341
Dai: Grampa, what's wrong?

00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:36.185
I-I'd recognize this terrible
energy anywhere. It's him.

00:09:36.218 --> 00:09:37.187
Then it's true...

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.725
I'd really hoped it
wouldn't come to this.

00:09:48.743 --> 00:09:51.583
[nervous gasp]

00:09:51.617 --> 00:09:54.021
[delighted chuckle]

00:09:54.055 --> 00:09:58.797
Hadlar: Was that magic circle
your idea of a practical joke?

00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:01.837
So, you've really
returned... Hadlar.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:02.705
Hadlar?!

00:10:02.738 --> 00:10:04.207
Oh... We're toast.

00:10:08.249 --> 00:10:09.317
Avan: The Dark Lord.

00:10:30.761 --> 00:10:32.698
Hadlar... The Dark Lord?

00:10:32.731 --> 00:10:34.401
[terrified yell]

00:10:34.434 --> 00:10:36.071
It's him, Dai.

00:10:36.105 --> 00:10:37.307
No doubt.

00:10:38.209 --> 00:10:40.380
Brass: I'd never
forget that awful face.

00:10:40.413 --> 00:10:43.887
But somehow he looks younger
and stronger than I remember.

00:10:43.921 --> 00:10:46.391
He's overflowing
with evil power!

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.028
[powerful grunt]

00:10:53.239 --> 00:10:54.943
[chuckling]

00:10:54.976 --> 00:10:57.615
Been a while...
Hero Avan.

00:10:57.648 --> 00:10:58.717
[shocked gasps]

00:10:59.552 --> 00:11:00.755
You're the Hero?

00:11:00.788 --> 00:11:02.457
Why didn't you tell us?

00:11:03.794 --> 00:11:08.369
Avan; long ago, you thwarted
all of my ambitions...

00:11:08.402 --> 00:11:10.941
You even cost me
my very existence.

00:11:10.975 --> 00:11:12.545
Hadlar: That's
not the kind of

00:11:12.578 --> 00:11:14.716
pain and humiliation
one forgets.

00:11:14.749 --> 00:11:18.222
But now, I'm here
to return it.

00:11:18.256 --> 00:11:20.828
You've taken hundreds
of innocent human lives.

00:11:20.862 --> 00:11:22.865
What you got was justice.

00:11:23.332 --> 00:11:24.736
Such an idealist.

00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:26.740
Compared to a
Darkling like me,

00:11:26.773 --> 00:11:29.144
human beings
are without value.

00:11:29.178 --> 00:11:32.050
My life is worth
more than thousands,

00:11:32.083 --> 00:11:34.454
if not millions of you vermin!

00:11:36.659 --> 00:11:37.862
Still the same.

00:11:37.895 --> 00:11:40.466
In fact, you might
be even more disgusting

00:11:40.499 --> 00:11:42.203
than the last time I saw you.

00:11:42.237 --> 00:11:45.076
I've grown tired
of your Hero antics.

00:11:45.109 --> 00:11:46.814
That's why I
knew your name!

00:11:46.847 --> 00:11:49.586
It was you. You're the
legendary warrior!

00:11:49.619 --> 00:11:51.022
You defeated the Dark Lord,

00:11:51.055 --> 00:11:53.493
and brought peace to
every kingdom in the land!

00:11:53.527 --> 00:11:55.263
Didn't you, Master Avan?

00:11:55.296 --> 00:11:57.333
Dai: Is it true, Master?

00:11:59.506 --> 00:12:01.342
That was a long time ago.

00:12:01.375 --> 00:12:03.246
Boys, you'd better stand back.

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:06.385
Not a chance!
We'll fight him with you!

00:12:07.555 --> 00:12:08.557
You'll lose!

00:12:08.591 --> 00:12:10.493
Come on. You too, gramps.

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:14.068
Wait!

00:12:14.101 --> 00:12:15.905
Master Avan needs our help!

00:12:15.938 --> 00:12:17.608
Don't be a coward, Popp.

00:12:17.641 --> 00:12:18.710
Don't be a fool!

00:12:18.744 --> 00:12:20.748
The only thing you
and I would do here,

00:12:20.781 --> 00:12:22.751
Dai, is get in his way.

00:12:28.129 --> 00:12:29.532
I can't believe he's really

00:12:29.566 --> 00:12:32.103
the one who defeated
the Dark Lord.

00:12:32.137 --> 00:12:33.205
Oh, man...

00:12:33.239 --> 00:12:35.978
I seriously chose the
wrong person to train under!

00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:38.349
Hadlar: I understand
you've gone into teaching...

00:12:38.382 --> 00:12:41.890
If those two are your
students, then I have to ask:

00:12:41.923 --> 00:12:43.292
For warriors of justice,

00:12:43.325 --> 00:12:46.031
don't you think
they're a little small?

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.336
Well for someone who's dead,

00:12:48.369 --> 00:12:50.339
don't you think you're
a little chatty?

00:12:52.945 --> 00:12:54.314
Have it your way.

00:12:55.183 --> 00:12:56.519
Boom!

00:13:05.537 --> 00:13:06.773
Avan: You know,

00:13:06.806 --> 00:13:08.977
I'm glad that you decided
to come here yourself.

00:13:09.011 --> 00:13:10.446
Now I can defeat you again

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.918
and clear the darkness
shrouding this world.

00:13:12.951 --> 00:13:14.387
What nonsense.

00:13:21.135 --> 00:13:22.236
Sizzle!

00:13:24.976 --> 00:13:27.213
[pained screaming]

00:13:27.247 --> 00:13:28.416
Both: Yes!

00:13:28.449 --> 00:13:33.258
[pained screaming]

00:13:33.292 --> 00:13:40.206
[cackling]

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.242
-What?
-How?

00:13:41.275 --> 00:13:50.594
[roaring laughter]

00:13:50.627 --> 00:13:52.565
Such a joke, Avan.

00:13:52.598 --> 00:13:54.635
Hadlar: Hilarious!

00:13:56.773 --> 00:13:57.976
But... how?

00:13:58.009 --> 00:13:59.846
You've grown arrogant, Hero.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.383
Heat and explosion
spells are my forte!

00:14:02.417 --> 00:14:04.723
Did you actually think
you could put me down

00:14:04.756 --> 00:14:06.659
with such a tiny ember?

00:14:06.693 --> 00:14:08.228
Hadlar: Watch and learn...

00:14:10.868 --> 00:14:14.107
This is how it's
really done. Now burn!

00:14:15.109 --> 00:14:17.413
Sizzle!

00:14:19.619 --> 00:14:21.021
Avan: Wave Slash!

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:28.368
Dai: Master!

00:14:32.745 --> 00:14:34.949
Avan: Impressive power...

00:14:36.285 --> 00:14:40.092
You're even stronger than the
last time we fought, Hadlar...

00:14:40.861 --> 00:14:41.663
But, how?

00:14:41.696 --> 00:14:42.865
[amused chuckle]

00:14:42.898 --> 00:14:44.835
You really want to know?

00:14:44.869 --> 00:14:47.474
Because I promise you
won't like my answer.

00:14:47.508 --> 00:14:48.610
And if I'm being honest,

00:14:48.643 --> 00:14:51.682
I'm going to miss you
calling me the Dark Lord.

00:14:52.751 --> 00:14:54.688
What's that supposed to mean?

00:14:54.722 --> 00:14:56.960
It's not like I
resurrected myself.

00:14:56.993 --> 00:14:59.197
But now I serve
the ruler who did.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:00.934
Hadlar: And he was
generous enough to

00:15:00.968 --> 00:15:03.506
bestow upon me with more
power than you can imagine.

00:15:04.108 --> 00:15:05.410
-Oh, no...
-What?

00:15:05.443 --> 00:15:07.815
Wait, wait, wait - is he saying
there's a new Dark Lord?

00:15:07.849 --> 00:15:09.318
Tell me...

00:15:09.351 --> 00:15:10.186
Who is it?!

00:15:13.192 --> 00:15:16.633
The Dark King... Vearn.

00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:17.869
There's a Dark King?!

00:15:17.902 --> 00:15:19.070
Vearn?!

00:15:19.672 --> 00:15:20.908
Hadlar: That's right!

00:15:20.941 --> 00:15:23.479
He is a mighty god
of the Underworld.

00:15:23.513 --> 00:15:24.682
After you defeated me,

00:15:24.716 --> 00:15:26.452
I was brought
before his throne...

00:15:26.485 --> 00:15:29.659
And he gave me a
glorious new purpose.

00:15:29.692 --> 00:15:31.095
God of the Underworld?

00:15:31.128 --> 00:15:33.767
Hadlar: I had to slumber for
over a decade before he could

00:15:33.801 --> 00:15:36.839
replenish the energy
you robbed me of,

00:15:36.873 --> 00:15:40.479
but after he raised me,
I pledged my allegiance.

00:15:40.514 --> 00:15:43.820
As a reward, he gave me
control over his Dark Army,

00:15:43.853 --> 00:15:46.258
and a place at his right hand.

00:15:46.291 --> 00:15:47.294
So you see,

00:15:47.327 --> 00:15:49.899
I can't call myself
the Dark Lord, anymore...

00:15:49.932 --> 00:15:52.003
But I am the Dark Commander!

00:15:52.036 --> 00:15:54.040
Unbelievable...

00:15:54.074 --> 00:15:56.512
How do we beat someone
stronger than this guy?

00:15:56.546 --> 00:15:57.848
That's the point...

00:15:57.882 --> 00:16:00.253
We can't. The whole
world's doomed!

00:16:00.286 --> 00:16:03.126
Hadlar: You can fight,
but I guarantee it's hopeless.

00:16:03.159 --> 00:16:06.131
My new master is an
omnipotent God of Dark...

00:16:06.165 --> 00:16:09.271
And his armies are greater
than your wildest nightmares-

00:16:09.304 --> 00:16:11.643
stronger than mine
could ever have been!

00:16:11.676 --> 00:16:13.412
There's nothing you can do...

00:16:13.445 --> 00:16:16.753
Humanity's destiny
is extinction.

00:16:16.786 --> 00:16:18.121
But... how...

00:16:19.257 --> 00:16:21.128
Hadlar: It's been
fifteen years,

00:16:21.162 --> 00:16:24.902
but I'm sure you still
remember my offer, Avan.

00:16:24.935 --> 00:16:27.039
So here's your second chance.

00:16:27.073 --> 00:16:29.846
I can still make your
troubles disappear...

00:16:29.879 --> 00:16:32.484
All you have
to do is join me.

00:16:32.518 --> 00:16:33.485
Hadlar: And if you do,

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.559
I'll even let you
rule half the world.

00:16:37.995 --> 00:16:39.397
Well, now...

00:16:39.431 --> 00:16:42.572
It almost looks like you're
sensing your own defeat.

00:16:42.605 --> 00:16:45.409
Hadlar: Perhaps this time
you'll be more reasonable.

00:16:45.811 --> 00:16:47.113
I refuse!

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:51.422
The same stubborn Avan.

00:16:51.455 --> 00:16:54.494
Unable to see mercy
when it's being given.

00:16:55.363 --> 00:16:57.801
Avan: You have no
clue what mercy is.

00:16:57.835 --> 00:17:00.608
Besides, if I did agree...

00:17:00.641 --> 00:17:03.145
I know you'd still
turn on me eventually.

00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:06.686
Don't be so certain.

00:17:06.719 --> 00:17:07.822
Avan: Either way,

00:17:07.855 --> 00:17:10.694
I doubt you have the authority
to offer me anything.

00:17:12.296 --> 00:17:14.068
You're not the
Dark Lord anymore-

00:17:14.101 --> 00:17:15.437
you're just a servant.

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:16.906
[fuming]

00:17:16.939 --> 00:17:19.611
Hadlar: I'm a commander.
How dare you?!

00:17:19.645 --> 00:17:24.320
Servant - you'll regret calling
me that, you little punk.

00:17:24.354 --> 00:17:26.726
Seems I've struck
a nerve - haven't I?

00:17:26.759 --> 00:17:28.563
Silence, mortal!

00:17:32.638 --> 00:17:34.541
Instead of sparing you...

00:17:34.575 --> 00:17:38.115
I'll make your students
watch as I turn you to ash.

00:17:38.148 --> 00:17:40.854
That's the strongest
Explosion Spell there is...

00:17:40.888 --> 00:17:41.690
A Kaboom!

00:17:41.723 --> 00:17:43.191
Master, watch out!

00:17:50.306 --> 00:17:52.076
I know that stance.

00:17:56.552 --> 00:17:57.754
Eat this...

00:17:58.088 --> 00:17:59.726
Kaboom!

00:17:59.759 --> 00:18:01.562
Avan Strash!

00:18:11.783 --> 00:18:12.718
Dai: Master?

00:18:26.178 --> 00:18:27.346
He got him!

00:18:29.151 --> 00:18:30.453
[impressed chuckle]

00:18:30.486 --> 00:18:31.756
Ah, yes.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:34.996
I was wondering when you
were going to do that...

00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:38.836
The Avan Strash took
my life the last time...

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.439
However...

00:18:46.017 --> 00:18:47.821
[shocked gasps]

00:18:47.855 --> 00:18:51.061
It appears my resurrected
form has the edge.

00:18:51.094 --> 00:18:52.397
And since you won't join me,

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:54.735
it's time for
the legend to end.

00:19:02.116 --> 00:19:03.653
Dai: Master Avan!

00:19:06.124 --> 00:19:08.328
Slow down - what do
you think you're doing?

00:19:08.362 --> 00:19:09.698
I'm gonna fight him!

00:19:09.732 --> 00:19:10.900
Are you out of your mind?

00:19:10.934 --> 00:19:14.508
How do you expect to beat
someone even Master Avan can't?

00:19:14.542 --> 00:19:18.015
Because I didn't blow all my
energy casting Puff earlier.

00:19:18.048 --> 00:19:20.587
He needs a hand, Popp.
Let me go!

00:19:21.622 --> 00:19:22.791
He's right.

00:19:22.825 --> 00:19:24.928
I've heard stories that Puff
can take three or four times

00:19:24.962 --> 00:19:28.603
the amount of Magic Power
that goes into a normal spell.

00:19:28.637 --> 00:19:29.505
Oh, great.

00:19:30.574 --> 00:19:32.043
Hey!

00:19:32.076 --> 00:19:34.313
Hadlar: You've
grown weak, Avan.

00:19:35.249 --> 00:19:36.820
Or maybe...

00:19:36.853 --> 00:19:38.155
This is simply the limit

00:19:38.188 --> 00:19:41.829
of what you pitiful little
humans are capable of.

00:19:44.067 --> 00:19:47.373
Hadlar: Allow me to
ease your suffering.

00:19:48.142 --> 00:19:49.377
Enough!

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.052
You want to join your
teacher, little one?

00:19:53.085 --> 00:19:54.420
Hadlar: Here's a lesson!

00:20:04.875 --> 00:20:05.977
C'mon, Dai...

00:20:10.954 --> 00:20:11.989
[gasp]

00:20:15.798 --> 00:20:16.799
Dai!

00:20:18.737 --> 00:20:21.274
That... Hurt... A lot.

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:31.295
Hadlar: You children
mean nothing to me.

00:20:31.328 --> 00:20:33.967
If you want to live,
get out of my sight.

00:20:34.001 --> 00:20:36.572
Popp: Th-Thank you.

00:20:36.606 --> 00:20:38.008
Excuse us!

00:20:47.293 --> 00:20:48.663
Hadlar: Really...

00:20:48.696 --> 00:20:51.101
Blood? But...

00:20:51.134 --> 00:20:52.270
That's impossible.

00:20:52.303 --> 00:20:53.471
That little brat's blade

00:20:53.506 --> 00:20:55.643
shouldn't have
even left a scratch.

00:20:58.784 --> 00:21:00.385
Hold it right there.

00:21:03.025 --> 00:21:04.728
Popp: Something wrong?

00:21:09.136 --> 00:21:10.673
[scared yell]

00:21:12.911 --> 00:21:14.882
Hadlar: I've changed my mind.

00:21:14.915 --> 00:21:18.055
It seems as though Avan's
students are too powerful

00:21:18.088 --> 00:21:20.660
to be left alive after all.

00:21:22.898 --> 00:21:24.902
I'll make it quick.

00:21:25.671 --> 00:21:26.872
Popp! Dai!

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:30.479
Sizzle!

00:21:37.528 --> 00:21:38.596
No!

00:22:01.241 --> 00:22:03.078
Dai: Master Avan!

00:23:37.367 --> 00:23:40.106
Narrator: The resurrected Dark
Lord's power is overwhelming.

00:23:40.139 --> 00:23:42.978
And even though Avan
defeated him once before,

00:23:43.012 --> 00:23:45.951
the master finds himself
backed into a corner.

00:23:45.984 --> 00:23:49.558
But when Dai sees his teacher
willing to sacrifice himself

00:23:49.591 --> 00:23:52.564
to save the world and defend
the lives of his students,

00:23:52.597 --> 00:23:55.068
his powers awaken once again.

00:23:56.271 --> 00:23:57.406
The battle rages on...

00:23:57.439 --> 00:23:59.612
So make sure not to
miss the next episode of

00:23:59.645 --> 00:24:01.583

The Adventure of Dai,
