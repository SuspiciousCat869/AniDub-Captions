WEBVTT

00:01:50.588 --> 00:01:52.792
Medroa!

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:56.132
[alarmed breaths]

00:02:00.407 --> 00:02:01.510
The end.

00:02:02.278 --> 00:02:04.649
Wow! Very impressive, Popp.

00:02:04.682 --> 00:02:07.689
Crocodine: You wiped them
all out with a single spell!

00:02:07.722 --> 00:02:09.458
Well, what can I say?

00:02:09.492 --> 00:02:12.465
We couldn't have done it without
your new attack too, Big Guy.

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:14.369
Hyunckel: It looks
like there is a spell

00:02:14.402 --> 00:02:17.207
that not even
Orichalcum can withstand.

00:02:19.244 --> 00:02:20.816
What's wrong?!

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:21.984
What is it, Hyunckel?!

00:02:22.018 --> 00:02:23.353
Keep your guard up.

00:02:23.386 --> 00:02:25.357
Something's still there.

00:02:29.498 --> 00:02:30.534
H-how?!

00:02:34.876 --> 00:02:36.412
It can't be!

00:02:39.552 --> 00:02:40.922
Popp: That's...

00:02:40.955 --> 00:02:44.094
That's impossible.

00:02:44.128 --> 00:02:45.397
Dai: They survived?

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.301
Popp: Nothing can
take a direct hit from

00:02:47.335 --> 00:02:49.873
that spell and come
out in one piece!

00:02:49.906 --> 00:02:51.275
That was close.

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:54.448
It looks like they brought
a half decent Mage with them.

00:03:02.566 --> 00:03:05.036
No, Block...
What have they done?!

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.438
Back there...

00:03:06.472 --> 00:03:08.711
if Block hadn't pushed us
to the ground and shielded us

00:03:08.744 --> 00:03:13.320
from the Mage's blast
at the very last second...

00:03:13.353 --> 00:03:16.459
all five of us would have
been vaporized into mist.

00:03:16.492 --> 00:03:18.463
Well, then...
Thank you, Block.

00:03:18.496 --> 00:03:21.536
I guess you lived up
to your name, after all.

00:03:24.108 --> 00:03:26.246
He... used himself
as a shield?

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:28.283
They're machines
created by forbidden magic

00:03:28.316 --> 00:03:31.590
and they still think
to sacrifice themselves.

00:03:31.623 --> 00:03:34.295
Even I have to admit
that was a brave act.

00:03:34.328 --> 00:03:37.502
Looks like even
villains can be selfless.

00:03:37.535 --> 00:03:39.606
They understand
the value of combining

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.812
their individual strengths
for the good of the group.

00:03:42.846 --> 00:03:46.486
It's a difficult lesson
that we've learned, as well.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.958
Dai: We knew they
were going to be tough.

00:03:48.991 --> 00:03:50.427
That they'd be unpredictable.

00:03:50.461 --> 00:03:52.397
But we're the only
thing in their way.

00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:54.702
There must be something
we can do to beat them.

00:03:54.736 --> 00:03:58.310
We haven't tried everything
yet, have we? Come on!

00:03:58.343 --> 00:04:00.314
We're still standing.

00:04:00.347 --> 00:04:01.650
You're right. Besides,

00:04:01.683 --> 00:04:04.923
we're flexible enough to
adapt to anything, aren't we?

00:04:06.392 --> 00:04:10.066
Okay, let's get it together
and deal the finishing blow!

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.737
Sigma: That won't happen.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:12.772
Sigma?!

00:04:18.584 --> 00:04:23.460
Even if I were to perish, the
Mirror of Shahal won't break.

00:04:23.493 --> 00:04:27.569
It is a legendary item, not
just another part of my body.

00:04:27.602 --> 00:04:29.739
It was granted to
me by Lord Hadlar.

00:04:31.242 --> 00:04:33.279
That was an
impressive spell, boy.

00:04:33.312 --> 00:04:34.983
But now that
we've seen it used,

00:04:35.017 --> 00:04:36.520
I don't believe
it will work on

00:04:36.553 --> 00:04:38.924
the Royal Guard
for a second time.

00:04:41.696 --> 00:04:45.538
Alright. Let's get on with
our second round, shall we?

00:04:46.238 --> 00:04:47.207
Albinass: Hym.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.212
Block still needs
to be healed.

00:04:49.245 --> 00:04:51.482
Do not lose sight
of the mission at hand.

00:04:51.516 --> 00:04:54.321
Who cares?! I'm done
with all that, Albinass.

00:04:54.355 --> 00:04:57.060
Nothing can get in my
way once I'm fired up.

00:04:57.093 --> 00:05:00.969
I'm going to avenge Block
as well, so don't worry!

00:05:01.002 --> 00:05:02.973
Hadlar: That's enough, Hym.

00:05:03.006 --> 00:05:07.314
Though I appreciate that
reckless personality of yours...

00:05:07.348 --> 00:05:11.957
you will not make things
difficult for Albinass.

00:05:13.426 --> 00:05:14.796
Hym: It's you.

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:21.108
Hym: Lord Hadlar...

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.979
In the flesh...

00:05:23.012 --> 00:05:23.981
Hadlar.

00:05:24.917 --> 00:05:25.784
Dai.

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:27.521
Hold on.

00:05:31.863 --> 00:05:33.466
It's an illusion.

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:36.305
Popp: An illusion?
You mean he's not really here?

00:05:36.338 --> 00:05:37.341
[smug chuckle]

00:05:37.374 --> 00:05:38.544
You're correct.

00:05:38.578 --> 00:05:41.382
What you're seeing is
a magical projection.

00:05:41.415 --> 00:05:44.154
The real me is within
the Field of Death.

00:05:44.188 --> 00:05:45.323
Hyunckel: So you sit back

00:05:45.356 --> 00:05:47.595
and let your servants
do your dirty work?

00:05:47.628 --> 00:05:49.867
I guess the rumors that
you've grown as a warrior

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.404
were nothing more
than lies, weren't they?

00:05:52.437 --> 00:05:55.512
I never intended to
defeat you by ambush,

00:05:55.545 --> 00:05:58.517
nor did I believe
I could, to be honest.

00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:01.990
We were content waiting for
you back at our stronghold.

00:06:02.024 --> 00:06:07.268
But then I heard that you
planned to bring some guests.

00:06:07.301 --> 00:06:08.704
What are you talking about?!

00:06:08.738 --> 00:06:12.845
I told you. The Royal Guard
protects the Field of Death.

00:06:12.878 --> 00:06:17.087
We would have accepted your
challenge fair and square.

00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:20.026
Hym: But then we learned that
the allied human kingdoms

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.398
were plotting an invasion.

00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:25.772
So we came here to
eliminate the unworthy.

00:06:25.805 --> 00:06:26.707
"Unworthy"?!

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.511
Hym: Under
Lord Hadlar's orders,

00:06:28.544 --> 00:06:31.617
our objective was to
put you all to the test.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.556
Basically, anyone
who's not standing

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:38.563
at this point is unworthy
of entering our domain.

00:06:40.434 --> 00:06:43.439
Dai, we will face
you and your allies.

00:06:43.473 --> 00:06:46.178
But I will not dishonor
the Dark King's presence

00:06:46.212 --> 00:06:48.483
with unworthy blood.

00:06:48.517 --> 00:06:50.755
I'll be waiting...

00:06:50.788 --> 00:06:53.994
Waiting for you
in the Field of Death!

00:06:54.028 --> 00:06:55.463
Hey, wait!

00:07:00.073 --> 00:07:00.975
Albinass: And with that,

00:07:01.008 --> 00:07:03.648
I suppose we will
take our leave, as well.

00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:05.651
Witnessing the true
depth of your skills

00:07:05.685 --> 00:07:08.156
was certainly
time well spent.

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:09.626
Come when you feel you're ready

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:12.765
and we'll welcome
the battle. Farewell.

00:07:16.372 --> 00:07:19.212
I dislike having
to cut a battle short.

00:07:19.245 --> 00:07:20.782
Hyunckel, was it not?

00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:23.688
I'll be paying you
back for this keepsake.

00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:27.595
But Lord Hadlar's
orders must be obeyed.

00:07:27.628 --> 00:07:28.864
So in the meantime

00:07:28.897 --> 00:07:32.103
I will pray that he
allows me that opportunity.

00:07:35.778 --> 00:07:38.049
Popp: Get back here!
I'll cut you short!

00:07:38.082 --> 00:07:41.155
No wait, Popp! Don't make
the same mistake twice.

00:07:41.188 --> 00:07:42.792
Huh?! Oh... right.

00:07:42.826 --> 00:07:45.263
We should tend to
the wounded, first.

00:07:45.296 --> 00:07:46.399
We need more help.

00:07:46.432 --> 00:07:48.469
Dai and Popp, get
Leona and the others.

00:07:48.503 --> 00:07:49.639
Popp: Got it!

00:07:53.914 --> 00:07:56.418
Albinass: We have
done as you commanded.

00:07:56.452 --> 00:07:57.889
Good work.

00:07:57.922 --> 00:08:01.128
But my lord, Hym,
Sigma, and Block

00:08:01.162 --> 00:08:03.734
are all in need
of regeneration.

00:08:03.768 --> 00:08:06.640
Hadlar: Very well.
As do you.

00:08:06.673 --> 00:08:09.478
Albinass: It's just a scratch.

00:08:09.513 --> 00:08:11.415
Hadlar: Now that you've
faced them in battle;

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:13.553
What do you think
of the Hero's party?

00:08:13.587 --> 00:08:17.127
I quite like them.
They're worthy opponents.

00:08:17.996 --> 00:08:20.234
Lord Hadlar-
where has Fenbren gone?

00:08:20.267 --> 00:08:21.770
It appears that a rodent

00:08:21.804 --> 00:08:24.274
has scurried into
the Field of Death.

00:08:24.308 --> 00:08:26.946
I sent Fenbren
to deal with it.

00:08:29.653 --> 00:08:32.758
Do you understand your
mission, Trooper Three?

00:08:39.338 --> 00:08:40.541
Right.

00:08:48.455 --> 00:08:50.627
Chiu: That's a
suspicious light!

00:08:52.497 --> 00:08:55.771
Chiu: What is this?
Popp left his staff?!

00:08:55.804 --> 00:08:58.844
He must have lost it
in the last battle here.

00:08:58.877 --> 00:09:00.948
I guess I'll return it to him.

00:09:00.981 --> 00:09:03.587
He might even show
me some gratitude.

00:09:03.621 --> 00:09:04.956
Gomechan: [chirping]

00:09:07.294 --> 00:09:08.931
[chirping]

00:09:08.964 --> 00:09:11.302
[screeching]

00:09:11.335 --> 00:09:13.674
I see. So there's
nothing out here

00:09:13.707 --> 00:09:15.343
but more pointy rocks, then.

00:09:15.376 --> 00:09:17.882
But you say that when you
fly over those mountains,

00:09:17.915 --> 00:09:19.653
a mysterious force blocks you.

00:09:19.686 --> 00:09:21.022
Am I hearing you right?

00:09:21.055 --> 00:09:21.990
[chirp]

00:09:23.158 --> 00:09:26.900
Chiu: It's a good thing I
brought Seari into the fold.

00:09:26.934 --> 00:09:30.207
It's a Seaslime that I
recruited back on the shore.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.110
I call it Trooper Three.

00:09:32.144 --> 00:09:33.847
[impressed chirping]

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.419
Huh? Well, of course!
I won easily!

00:09:36.452 --> 00:09:37.755
It's not very strong,

00:09:37.788 --> 00:09:40.594
but I figured we could use
a scout in the water, too.

00:09:41.162 --> 00:09:42.898
Pretty smart, right?

00:09:44.201 --> 00:09:47.074
Chiu: Right now it's searching
the ocean floor for an entrance.

00:09:47.107 --> 00:09:49.111
If there isn't one
above ground, then...

00:09:49.144 --> 00:09:51.983
Fenbren: Very good
instincts, little one.

00:09:53.419 --> 00:09:54.890
Chiu: You're from
the Dark Army!

00:09:54.923 --> 00:09:56.993
One of those
Orichalcum things!

00:09:57.026 --> 00:09:58.195
Fenbren: Indeed.

00:09:58.229 --> 00:10:01.603
I am the bishop of
the Hadlar Royal Guard...

00:10:01.636 --> 00:10:03.272
Fenbren.

00:11:05.296 --> 00:11:06.031
Seari!

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:10.874
You don't say. A giant
gate under the ocean?!

00:11:10.907 --> 00:11:14.682
I see. That entrance must
lead right to the Dark King.

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:16.786
It really was underwater.

00:11:16.819 --> 00:11:17.989
Hey, spike-face!

00:11:18.022 --> 00:11:19.926
The Beast King Commandos
have discovered

00:11:19.959 --> 00:11:22.799
the secret entrance to
your silly little hideout.

00:11:22.832 --> 00:11:24.000
How d'you like that?!

00:11:24.034 --> 00:11:25.269
[chirping]

00:11:25.303 --> 00:11:29.545
Fenbren: Oh, my. So, you've
seen the Dark Citadel Gate.

00:11:29.578 --> 00:11:30.848
Cita-what now?!

00:11:30.881 --> 00:11:33.821
Fenbren: How remarkably
clever you are.

00:11:33.854 --> 00:11:36.760
It's the only entrance
to Vearn Palace,

00:11:36.794 --> 00:11:40.634
our mighty king's
Great Dark Citadel.

00:11:40.667 --> 00:11:43.740
Dark Citadel...
Vearn Palace, huh?

00:11:53.526 --> 00:11:55.129
[mocking cackle]

00:11:55.162 --> 00:11:56.198
You messed up!

00:11:56.231 --> 00:11:59.204
But thanks for the precious
information, doofus.

00:11:59.237 --> 00:12:02.244
Once we return to Dai
and tell him what we know,

00:12:02.277 --> 00:12:06.653
he'll launch a full-scale attack
on this dumb "Vearn Palace."

00:12:06.686 --> 00:12:09.090
So look forward to that!

00:12:10.527 --> 00:12:11.963
Fenbren: Sadly, little one,

00:12:11.997 --> 00:12:16.539
this scheme of yours
has several flaws.

00:12:16.573 --> 00:12:21.081
The first of which is assuming
that you can leave this island!

00:12:23.485 --> 00:12:24.989
[pained groans]

00:12:26.793 --> 00:12:28.195
[falling yells]

00:12:28.228 --> 00:12:32.370
[pained groans]

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.676
Chiu: A... Woosh spell?

00:12:34.709 --> 00:12:35.945
Fenbren: Indeed.

00:12:35.978 --> 00:12:39.385
I have mastered all kinds
of Vortex-type spells.

00:12:39.418 --> 00:12:43.694
They help... level the playing
field, wouldn't you say?

00:12:43.727 --> 00:12:45.030
Chiu: Oh, no...

00:12:45.063 --> 00:12:49.505
Fenbren: Now, back to the
flaws in your little plan;

00:12:49.539 --> 00:12:51.141
you will find it
impossible to enter

00:12:51.174 --> 00:12:54.047
the Dark Citadel by
that underwater gate.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.955
The way is sealed with King
Vearn's Supercharged Dark Magic.

00:12:57.988 --> 00:13:02.798
It is a legendary gate, one that
hasn't opened in centuries.

00:13:02.832 --> 00:13:04.301
That makes no sense!

00:13:04.335 --> 00:13:07.374
How are you supposed to get in
and out of that place, then?!

00:13:07.407 --> 00:13:09.879
Fenbren: We are warriors
of the Dark Army,

00:13:09.913 --> 00:13:12.585
bestowed with a
special enchantment.

00:13:12.618 --> 00:13:16.424
We enter and exit
using Zoom spells.

00:13:16.458 --> 00:13:19.899
There's no chance that an
outsider can pry open the gate,

00:13:19.932 --> 00:13:22.705
no matter what
power they wield.

00:13:22.738 --> 00:13:26.412
Chiu: You're saying that no
one can get to the Dark King,

00:13:26.445 --> 00:13:28.550
no matter how hard they try?

00:13:28.584 --> 00:13:31.488
Fenbren: Not even a
Dragon Knight.

00:13:31.522 --> 00:13:33.960
You lie. I don't believe you!

00:13:33.993 --> 00:13:36.999
Fenbren: It doesn't really
matter what you believe.

00:13:37.033 --> 00:13:39.806
Your third and final
flaw is assuming

00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:43.278
Dai will hear any
of your "report".

00:13:43.312 --> 00:13:44.415
Chiu: Huh?

00:13:44.448 --> 00:13:47.721
Fenbren: Because you, my
friend, are not going anywhere.

00:13:47.755 --> 00:13:52.029
You and your
ridiculous "commandos".

00:14:00.814 --> 00:14:03.118
[pained yell]

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.209
Seari!

00:14:17.346 --> 00:14:18.750
Fenbren: Worm.

00:14:18.784 --> 00:14:22.658
Fenbren: Know your place.

00:14:23.827 --> 00:14:25.931
Chiu: Rattus Rocket Ram!

00:14:28.703 --> 00:14:29.605
[worried chirp]

00:14:29.638 --> 00:14:31.408
[pained yell]

00:14:40.426 --> 00:14:41.596
Fenbren: You fool.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:45.637
Can't you see that my body
is made entirely of blades...

00:14:45.671 --> 00:14:47.407
Fenbren: Now you've
injured yourself

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.944
simply to rescue this...

00:14:48.977 --> 00:14:50.580
pathetic specimen.

00:14:53.419 --> 00:14:54.522
Chiu: Sh-Shut up!

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:58.964
Chiu: These monsters
may look pathetic to you...

00:14:58.997 --> 00:15:04.007
but they're the first
real allies I've ever had.

00:15:04.041 --> 00:15:08.550
Each of them are proud and
courageous members of my unit.

00:15:08.584 --> 00:15:12.023
And I'm...
I'm their captain.

00:15:12.592 --> 00:15:14.228
The kind of captain-

00:15:14.261 --> 00:15:16.966
that protects his
troops with his life!

00:15:22.945 --> 00:15:26.118
Fenbren: Well said.
You're brave for a rat.

00:15:26.152 --> 00:15:31.629
But you're going to be begging
for mercy until the very end.

00:15:33.365 --> 00:15:36.840
Fenbren: You see, the other
members of the Royal Guard

00:15:36.873 --> 00:15:39.846
are all chivalrous warriors.

00:15:39.879 --> 00:15:41.248
But not me.

00:15:41.281 --> 00:15:45.056
I only keep in line
for the sake of order,

00:15:45.089 --> 00:15:50.700
and believe me, it's left
me starving for cruelty.

00:15:55.009 --> 00:15:56.979
Leona: Hurry,
get him some help!

00:16:09.772 --> 00:16:12.210
What happened-
where is everybody?!

00:16:12.243 --> 00:16:13.747
I should have been here.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:16.986
Were the elite warriors from
Bengarna part of this battle-

00:16:17.019 --> 00:16:18.155
where are they?!

00:16:18.189 --> 00:16:21.963
They... They were
the very first to be

00:16:21.996 --> 00:16:25.002
defeated when the
dock was attacked.

00:16:25.036 --> 00:16:27.106
Gomez: They're
probably still in...

00:16:27.139 --> 00:16:28.643
Akhim: What?!

00:16:31.916 --> 00:16:34.087
Dai: Nova, are you okay?

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.328
Dai...

00:16:38.362 --> 00:16:40.634
Dai: You're finally awake.
You need healing.

00:16:40.668 --> 00:16:42.504
Leave me.

00:16:42.538 --> 00:16:46.178
I'm dead weight. I can't
move a single muscle.

00:16:46.211 --> 00:16:48.182
There's this giant cloud...

00:16:48.215 --> 00:16:52.157
This gigantic shame
just hanging over me.

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:56.064
So take mercy...
Forget I'm even here.

00:16:56.666 --> 00:16:57.768
W-What are you...

00:16:58.903 --> 00:17:00.139
[pained scream]

00:17:00.173 --> 00:17:01.742
What was that for?!

00:17:01.776 --> 00:17:03.747
See? You can still stand.

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:06.987
It's your damaged pride that's
sucking out all your energy,

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.623
and it's insufferable.

00:17:09.558 --> 00:17:11.362
Maam: There are plenty
of wounded here

00:17:11.395 --> 00:17:13.199
who aren't as strong as you-

00:17:13.232 --> 00:17:15.571
and they still fought harder!

00:17:15.604 --> 00:17:16.639
If you can stand,

00:17:16.672 --> 00:17:19.612
get back to the base
on your own two feet!

00:17:19.645 --> 00:17:21.081
It's your choice.

00:17:21.115 --> 00:17:23.820
That, or I drag you
all the way there.

00:17:27.026 --> 00:17:29.531
I'll help carry the wounded.

00:17:32.136 --> 00:17:33.640
I guess whoever
ends up with Maam

00:17:33.673 --> 00:17:36.478
is in for quite the
experience, aren't they?

00:17:38.917 --> 00:17:40.755
Dai [thought]: I wonder
if Leona has...

00:17:40.788 --> 00:17:42.524
always been this way.

00:17:43.159 --> 00:17:44.160
Popp: Hey!

00:17:45.163 --> 00:17:48.837
No good. We had no luck
finding Chiu anywhere.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.908
Gomechan's missing, too.

00:17:50.941 --> 00:17:52.645
It looks like they
really went out there.

00:17:52.678 --> 00:17:55.216
Maam: They left for the
Field of Death by themselves?!

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:57.453
Crocodine: Sorry.
If I'd known he'd do this,

00:17:57.486 --> 00:18:00.561
I wouldn't have given
him the Beast King Flute.

00:18:00.594 --> 00:18:02.898
He probably recruited
a flying monster

00:18:02.932 --> 00:18:05.402
to take them all
the way over there.

00:18:05.436 --> 00:18:07.206
I know he's only
trying to help,

00:18:07.239 --> 00:18:09.144
but the enemy's too dangerous.

00:18:09.177 --> 00:18:11.281
I'll Zoom over and
try to get them back.

00:18:11.315 --> 00:18:13.754
Hyunckel and I
will come with you.

00:18:13.787 --> 00:18:15.056
Popp: Glad to have you.

00:18:15.089 --> 00:18:16.224
I'll go as well.

00:18:16.258 --> 00:18:17.795
No, Dai. Stay here.

00:18:17.828 --> 00:18:20.734
It's temporary, but we'll
be splitting forces.

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:23.940
The people here are going
to need you and Maam.

00:18:23.973 --> 00:18:25.109
Dai: All right.

00:18:25.142 --> 00:18:26.445
Leona: Popp.

00:18:26.478 --> 00:18:29.384
Once you find Chiu,
you must come straight back.

00:18:29.417 --> 00:18:30.787
Our ship has been destroyed,

00:18:30.821 --> 00:18:34.128
so we all need to regroup and
form a new plan of attack.

00:18:34.161 --> 00:18:36.265
Fighting can come later.

00:18:36.298 --> 00:18:37.901
Aye-aye, Princess.

00:18:37.934 --> 00:18:39.237
I'm well aware.

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:40.540
"Never make the same potentially
fatal mistake twice."

00:18:40.573 --> 00:18:42.176
That's my motto!

00:18:46.051 --> 00:18:47.219
[giggling]

00:18:47.253 --> 00:18:49.190
Popp: We're off, then.
Keep an eye on the base.

00:18:49.223 --> 00:18:51.294
And you three
be careful, 'kay?

00:18:59.946 --> 00:19:01.783
Fenbren: You're
quite resilient.

00:19:01.816 --> 00:19:05.390
Much tougher than I thought.

00:19:05.423 --> 00:19:08.262
Chiu: A rat...
shows its true strength...

00:19:08.295 --> 00:19:10.266
when it's been cornered!

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.401
Fenbren: [scoffing]

00:19:11.802 --> 00:19:14.007
[pained scream]

00:19:14.041 --> 00:19:15.910
Fenbren: You were saying?

00:19:17.981 --> 00:19:19.985
Chiu: Don't...
worry, commandos!

00:19:20.019 --> 00:19:25.162
I-I promise... I promise that
I'll get you all out of here!

00:19:25.195 --> 00:19:26.866
Just you watch!

00:19:29.237 --> 00:19:32.644
Are you kidding?
Th-This thing barely tickles.

00:19:33.145 --> 00:19:34.347
[pained cry]

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:57.861
Fenbren: I doubt I'll ever meet
a rodent this defiant again.

00:19:57.895 --> 00:19:59.765
[howling]

00:20:00.768 --> 00:20:10.385
[powerful chirping]

00:20:21.341 --> 00:20:23.713
Chiu: Gomechan!

00:20:23.746 --> 00:20:27.086
Fenbren: W-where did
that thing come from?!

00:20:27.119 --> 00:20:31.161
Fenbren: What? No!

00:20:31.194 --> 00:20:35.002
Fenbren: Impossible.
This is impossible.

00:20:35.036 --> 00:20:37.006
My body is made
of Orichalcum...

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.610
How could that puny

00:20:38.643 --> 00:20:42.216
little Slime put even
a dent in my armor?!

00:20:42.249 --> 00:20:44.253
Inconceivable!

00:20:45.022 --> 00:20:46.559
Fenbren: No matter
how it happened,

00:20:46.593 --> 00:20:50.567
I must ensure that it
doesn't happen again.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:54.609
How unusual a creature-
but nevertheless,

00:20:54.642 --> 00:20:57.246
it's punishment is certain.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.685
Now, with pleasure!

00:20:59.719 --> 00:21:03.793
[roaring]

00:21:03.827 --> 00:21:07.333
You won't lay your hands
on Trooper Number Two!

00:21:07.366 --> 00:21:08.936
Fenbren: Move.

00:21:13.513 --> 00:21:15.584
Fenbren: You troublesome rat.

00:21:15.617 --> 00:21:17.921
I shall exterminate you both!

00:21:24.333 --> 00:21:28.142
Wh-Who's there?! Who are you?!

00:21:28.175 --> 00:21:30.213
Baran: What a horrible sight.

00:21:30.246 --> 00:21:34.722
The strong
bullying the weak...

00:21:34.755 --> 00:21:37.894
I never realized
how ugly it could be.

00:21:38.863 --> 00:21:39.998
Fenbren: What?!

00:21:42.203 --> 00:21:44.274
Baran: Begone from here.

00:21:44.307 --> 00:21:48.448
Otherwise, I'll take
more than your sight.

00:21:48.481 --> 00:21:51.956
Fenbren: I don't know who
you are, but remember this:

00:21:51.989 --> 00:21:54.895
I vow to make you pay!

00:23:37.868 --> 00:23:39.538
Narrator: Popp,
Hyunckel, and Crocodine

00:23:39.572 --> 00:23:42.142
arrive in the Field of
Death to retrieve Chiu,

00:23:42.176 --> 00:23:47.319
but soon they encounter
Dai's father, General Baran.

00:23:47.352 --> 00:23:49.491
When they learn
Baran's new goal,

00:23:49.525 --> 00:23:52.229
Hyunckel and Crocodine
try to stop him-

00:23:52.263 --> 00:23:54.301
only, there's
something different

00:23:54.334 --> 00:23:56.404
about the Dragon Master.

00:23:56.438 --> 00:23:57.941
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:57.974 --> 00:24:00.713
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:00.747 --> 00:24:03.552
"The Avan Style
Ultimate Technique".
