WEBVTT

00:02:06.954 --> 00:02:08.791
Flora: Vearn Palace
has arrived...

00:02:08.824 --> 00:02:10.226
It's almost time.

00:02:11.462 --> 00:02:14.435
Gomez: Those fiends kept them
tied up like that all night?

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:16.472
They really are monsters.

00:02:17.274 --> 00:02:19.045
Lady Amy [thought]:
Hyunckel...

00:02:19.078 --> 00:02:20.682
Don't worry, my friends.

00:02:20.715 --> 00:02:22.953
We're going to
get you out of there!

00:02:22.986 --> 00:02:23.821
[chirp]

00:02:33.775 --> 00:02:35.243
Get ready.

00:02:44.462 --> 00:02:48.369
Vearn: The sun has reached
its highest point...

00:02:49.573 --> 00:02:54.883
Shining so gloriously.
Now, everything is in place.

00:02:57.054 --> 00:02:58.824
Mystvearn: It is noon.

00:03:04.636 --> 00:03:05.804
All right, then.

00:03:05.838 --> 00:03:08.877
What do you sense, Merle?
Do you think that's all of them?

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.383
Yes.

00:03:11.416 --> 00:03:12.952
The Shadow Legion Commander

00:03:12.986 --> 00:03:14.956
and his squadron of
Restless Armors.

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.664
There's thirty-six of them.
I can also sense...

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:22.003
a lot of pressure coming
from Vearn Palace, but...

00:03:22.037 --> 00:03:24.843
that's everyone
who's on the ground.

00:03:24.877 --> 00:03:28.449
Our troops can handle a
number of that size, but...

00:03:28.483 --> 00:03:31.289
Mystvearn is going to
be the real challenge.

00:03:31.322 --> 00:03:32.926
Mystvearn: I'm sure
you haven't forgotten

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.428
my offer, Hyunckel.

00:03:34.461 --> 00:03:38.938
If you drink the Dark Aura from
this chalice and serve me...

00:03:38.971 --> 00:03:41.475
I will let you go free.

00:03:43.012 --> 00:03:44.348
Mystvearn:
What do you choose?

00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:47.121
I'm not drinking anything
until you untie me.

00:03:47.154 --> 00:03:49.291
Mystvearn: [chuckling]

00:03:49.325 --> 00:03:51.262
Very well.

00:03:56.807 --> 00:03:59.178
Mystvearn: But remember,
there's no turning back

00:03:59.211 --> 00:04:01.315
once this touches your lips.

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.290
Your soul will belong
to me for the rest of time.

00:04:07.093 --> 00:04:10.534
Don't do this!
It isn't worth it!

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:17.849
Hyunckel, no!

00:04:17.883 --> 00:04:24.094
Crocodine... D-Do not
forget... what I told you...

00:04:24.128 --> 00:04:25.598
Please...

00:04:32.043 --> 00:04:33.781
[maddened roar]

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:44.936
[struggling grunts]

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.480
[howling]

00:04:50.515 --> 00:04:53.486
Mystvearn: Foolish boy.
I know you.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.025
I'm sure you thought
that you could trick me

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:57.695
by pretending to give in.

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:03.239
But unfortunately, my Dark Aura
is not so easily overcome.

00:05:03.272 --> 00:05:05.945
And no matter what you
may have intended...

00:05:05.978 --> 00:05:08.650
You now belong to me.

00:05:09.218 --> 00:05:14.796
[roaring]

00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:27.020
[menacing growl]

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:28.824
Something's not right.

00:05:28.857 --> 00:05:31.296
What's happening to
Sir Hyunckel down there?

00:05:31.329 --> 00:05:34.134
Whatever was in that
chalice is changing him...

00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:36.105
Maybe some kind of potion?

00:05:36.138 --> 00:05:38.043
It was Dark Aura.

00:05:38.076 --> 00:05:39.344
What?

00:05:39.378 --> 00:05:42.317
I see an evil presence
at work in Hyunckel's heart.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.627
I'm sure of it. It must
be the enemy's Dark Aura.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.668
He willingly opened
himself up to an evil force?

00:05:50.701 --> 00:05:53.974
How could a Disciple of Avan...
do such a thing?!

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.755
Crocodine: I don't
understand...

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:03.025
Mystvearn: It feels
good, doesn't it?

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:06.232
I suspect if I commanded
you to take someone's head,

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:10.975
you would find it as easy as
plucking a flower from its stem.

00:06:14.047 --> 00:06:15.585
Mystvearn: Just as you should.

00:06:15.618 --> 00:06:18.891
You've finally returned
to where you belong.

00:06:18.925 --> 00:06:20.127
He belongs with us!

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.597
And no matter what you say,

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.268
he wouldn't lose his
righteous heart so easily.

00:06:24.301 --> 00:06:26.105
Mystvearn: Of course he would.

00:06:26.138 --> 00:06:27.609
Your vision may be limited,

00:06:27.642 --> 00:06:30.481
but I know you can
perceive a man's Aura.

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:34.087
Take a look for yourself.
What do you see?

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.161
Crocodine [thought]:
His Aura of Light...

00:06:37.194 --> 00:06:38.898
I can barely feel it.

00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:39.866
It's as though he's been

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.239
completely enveloped
in darkness...

00:06:43.272 --> 00:06:45.577
Crocodine [thought]: It's so
powerful that before long,

00:06:45.611 --> 00:06:48.817
all of the good in Hyunckel
will be extinguished.

00:06:51.222 --> 00:06:52.892
Mystvearn: This
is the price he pays

00:06:52.925 --> 00:06:56.934
for underestimating the
influence of my Dark Aura.

00:06:56.967 --> 00:06:59.472
It was a grave error
to assume that his light

00:06:59.506 --> 00:07:02.845
would be able to
overcome such a force.

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:06.085
With my training,
he will know better.

00:07:06.118 --> 00:07:08.122
I told him many times:

00:07:08.156 --> 00:07:11.597
There are some things in this
world that cannot be overcome...

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.103
and the power of
darkness is one of them.

00:07:18.209 --> 00:07:19.445
Alas, my friend.

00:07:19.478 --> 00:07:22.752
Your final gambit was
certainly a clever one...

00:07:22.785 --> 00:07:25.658
But it seems that
clever wasn't enough.

00:07:27.695 --> 00:07:29.833
Mystvearn: And now
your soul is mine.

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:32.037
But still, you seem sluggish.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:33.440
The Dark Aura you drank

00:07:33.473 --> 00:07:36.078
has already healed
your wounds. However...

00:07:36.112 --> 00:07:39.586
I can sense that you've retained
a shred of your conscience...

00:07:39.619 --> 00:07:42.091
and that will need
to be removed.

00:07:42.124 --> 00:07:44.930
In order to complete
the transformation,

00:07:44.963 --> 00:07:47.969
and become the warrior
you once were...

00:07:48.002 --> 00:07:51.208
Take this and
execute Crocodine.

00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:56.218
Mystvearn: Killing a former
ally should extinguish

00:07:56.252 --> 00:07:58.590
your conscience for good.

00:07:58.624 --> 00:08:02.030
Your Aura of Light
will never recover,

00:08:02.063 --> 00:08:06.205
and then you will once again
become the Dark Swordsman.

00:08:06.238 --> 00:08:08.209
Now... do it.

00:08:13.653 --> 00:08:15.289
Hyunckel, no...

00:08:21.937 --> 00:08:24.576
Chiu: No... Amy, you
can't go out there yet!

00:08:24.609 --> 00:08:26.546
Lady Amy: But
Hyunckel needs us!

00:08:26.579 --> 00:08:29.051
Gomez: We know that,
but it's not the right move.

00:08:29.084 --> 00:08:31.723
If we charge in before Dai
and the others rescue them,

00:08:31.757 --> 00:08:33.660
we'll give the game away.

00:08:33.694 --> 00:08:35.397
And if we let him do this,

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:37.868
there won't be anyone
left to rescue.

00:08:39.471 --> 00:08:40.841
She's right.

00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:47.053
Crocodine [thought]:
What are my options?

00:08:47.087 --> 00:08:49.392
Even if I break free
and can fight,

00:08:49.425 --> 00:08:51.362
Hyunckel is my friend...

00:08:51.395 --> 00:08:52.665
Wait!

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:57.408
Crocodine, if you really do
count me as a friend...

00:08:57.441 --> 00:09:01.148
Then I need you to trust
me no matter what.

00:09:04.288 --> 00:09:06.158
Crocodine [thought]:
If there's even a shred of

00:09:06.191 --> 00:09:09.899
his conscience left, that
means he's still fighting...

00:09:09.933 --> 00:09:13.707
It means there's a desperate
battle raging in his heart.

00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:18.551
I have to... I have to trust
him and believe he can win.

00:09:18.584 --> 00:09:21.523
Come on, Hyunckel.
You can't give up.

00:09:21.556 --> 00:09:24.662
You have to resist
the Dark Aura!

00:09:24.695 --> 00:09:28.737
Mystvearn: Kill him.
Stop hesitating. Do it now!

00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:31.375
[struggling grunts]

00:09:31.408 --> 00:09:33.580
You can beat this.
I believe in you.

00:09:33.613 --> 00:09:35.518
And no matter
what you do to me,

00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:37.287
I will keep on believing...

00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:39.191
until the very end.

00:09:39.224 --> 00:09:40.762
Hyunckel: [struggling grunts]

00:09:40.795 --> 00:09:42.097
That's it! Keep going.

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.670
Fight and drive that
evil out of your heart.

00:09:44.703 --> 00:09:46.573
Mystvearn: Don't listen
to this nonsense.

00:09:46.607 --> 00:09:49.011
Do what you're told
and finish him.

00:09:49.044 --> 00:09:50.113
Don't give in!

00:09:50.146 --> 00:09:51.381
Mystvearn: I said do it!

00:09:55.156 --> 00:10:00.233
[furious roar]

00:10:01.604 --> 00:10:03.205
Mystvearn: W-What?!

00:10:19.338 --> 00:10:20.974
Oh, no. Hyunckel!

00:10:23.312 --> 00:10:25.717
Mystvearn: He... He's dead.

00:10:26.385 --> 00:10:27.688
[shocked gasp]

00:10:33.499 --> 00:10:35.538
Mystvearn:
Well, this is a pity.

00:10:35.571 --> 00:10:36.874
If he had just accepted it,

00:10:36.907 --> 00:10:39.745
he could have been the
Dark Army's greatest warrior.

00:10:39.779 --> 00:10:41.114
The force of
the conflicting Auras

00:10:41.148 --> 00:10:44.154
must have been
too much to endure.

00:10:46.158 --> 00:10:49.298
I can't sense his life
energy at all - It's gone.

00:10:49.331 --> 00:10:50.767
It just vanished!

00:10:52.203 --> 00:10:55.009
And without him, we no
longer have the five

00:10:55.043 --> 00:10:58.517
Disciples of Avan needed
to cast the Kaglimmer spell.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.288
What are Dai and
the others waiting for?

00:11:01.322 --> 00:11:03.827
I've stood by long enough.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.432
Hey, what's your
problem? Let go of me!

00:11:06.465 --> 00:11:08.537
You really don't get it, kid?

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.874
The reason they
haven't attacked yet...

00:11:10.908 --> 00:11:14.014
is because they understand
what Hyunckel is trying to do.

00:11:14.047 --> 00:11:14.916
What?

00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:17.120
For a warrior
of his caliber...

00:11:17.153 --> 00:11:21.295
Life itself is merely another
weapon for him to wield.

00:11:22.832 --> 00:11:25.738
Mystvearn: How disappointing,
and all in vain, too.

00:11:25.771 --> 00:11:27.508
But at least he'll
have a companion

00:11:27.541 --> 00:11:29.713
for his journey
to the afterlife.

00:11:29.746 --> 00:11:31.583
[resentful growl]

00:11:31.616 --> 00:11:33.485
Crocodine [thought]:
I'm sorry, Hyunckel.

00:11:38.029 --> 00:11:39.297
Mystvearn: [surprised gasp]

00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:40.734
But how?!

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:43.072
That's impossible!

00:11:43.105 --> 00:11:47.280
Hyunckel: "Impossible" feels
pretty good... Mystvearn.

00:11:48.617 --> 00:11:49.852
As a matter of fact,

00:11:49.885 --> 00:11:53.192
I expect if I decided to
take your head right now,

00:11:53.225 --> 00:11:54.762
I'd find it...

00:11:55.463 --> 00:11:56.766
As easy...

00:12:00.975 --> 00:12:03.980
as plucking a flower
from its stem.

00:12:15.036 --> 00:12:16.740
I don't believe it...

00:12:16.773 --> 00:12:18.543
Both: Hyunckel's back!

00:12:18.576 --> 00:12:19.913
Mystvearn:
It doesn't make sense.

00:12:19.946 --> 00:12:22.952
I felt your life energy
disappear - there was no doubt.

00:12:22.985 --> 00:12:25.524
How are you still alive?

00:12:25.557 --> 00:12:28.229
Oh, it's actually very simple.

00:12:28.262 --> 00:12:30.802
Hyunckel: You see,
there were two opposing Auras

00:12:30.835 --> 00:12:32.772
battling inside of me.

00:12:32.806 --> 00:12:36.379
And then... one of
them beat the other.

00:12:36.412 --> 00:12:38.650
What you felt disappear?

00:12:38.683 --> 00:12:41.956
Well, that was the Aura
that lost the fight.

00:12:42.992 --> 00:12:44.427
Mystvearn: It can't be...

00:12:45.297 --> 00:12:48.302
[roaring]

00:12:58.489 --> 00:12:59.659
Crocodine: I knew it.

00:12:59.692 --> 00:13:01.028
Mystvearn: Unbelievable.

00:13:01.061 --> 00:13:04.134
How has your Aura of Light
grown so powerful?!

00:13:04.167 --> 00:13:06.372
Hyunckel: You were right
about the Dark Aura-

00:13:06.405 --> 00:13:08.710
that it was strong enough
to suppress other powers,

00:13:08.744 --> 00:13:11.048
but there's another
factor in play.

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:14.187
By overwhelming me with
your concentrated Aura,

00:13:14.221 --> 00:13:17.127
The light within me was
almost extinguished...

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.832
And as a result, the only
way for it to survive-

00:13:19.866 --> 00:13:22.738
Was for it to grow
stronger than ever before.

00:13:22.771 --> 00:13:24.108
It looked like
you were winning,

00:13:24.141 --> 00:13:26.412
but the harder I
fought not to give in,

00:13:26.445 --> 00:13:28.415
the more powerful it became...

00:13:28.449 --> 00:13:32.357
Until... it was strong enough
to suppress your Darkness.

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:35.764
Mystvearn: Impressive. So that
was your intent all along...

00:13:35.798 --> 00:13:37.935
Using my Dark
Aura as catalyst

00:13:37.968 --> 00:13:41.876
to increase your own
power right under my nose.

00:13:42.678 --> 00:13:45.049
Not that long ago,
you told me...

00:13:45.082 --> 00:13:48.790
That abandoning my Dark Aura
had only made me weaker...

00:13:48.823 --> 00:13:49.792
But, turns out-

00:13:49.825 --> 00:13:51.829
All I needed to do
was learn how to

00:13:51.863 --> 00:13:54.467
use these opposing
energies in harmony.

00:13:54.935 --> 00:13:56.338
When I was evil,

00:13:56.371 --> 00:14:00.012
I hated the power of light that
Avan had unearthed in me...

00:14:00.046 --> 00:14:01.381
And when I was good,

00:14:01.414 --> 00:14:04.589
all I wanted was to overcome
the darkness in my heart.

00:14:04.622 --> 00:14:08.496
Over time, this tension boosted
the strength of both Auras.

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:10.801
So when you told me
to accept your darkness,

00:14:10.834 --> 00:14:13.272
I knew I could use
it to fuel my light...

00:14:13.305 --> 00:14:14.976
and give myself
a chance to shine

00:14:15.009 --> 00:14:17.581
brighter than either
of us could imagine.

00:14:17.615 --> 00:14:18.883
Mystvearn: This is absurd.

00:14:18.917 --> 00:14:20.721
Even if what you're
saying is true,

00:14:20.754 --> 00:14:22.323
the light
within you would never

00:14:22.356 --> 00:14:24.662
measure up against
my Dark Aura...

00:14:24.696 --> 00:14:29.038
And there's no way it could
possibly suppress it.

00:14:29.071 --> 00:14:31.375
I'm sure you already
sense you're wrong.

00:14:31.408 --> 00:14:34.649
By now, my Light has overwhelmed
the Darkness inside me.

00:14:34.682 --> 00:14:37.353
A fate that you
will soon share as well.

00:14:41.362 --> 00:14:43.566
Mystvearn: Silence!

00:14:48.811 --> 00:14:51.481
[roaring]

00:14:56.358 --> 00:14:57.426
[pained groan]

00:15:04.141 --> 00:15:07.146
Crocodine: Defeating a
Restless Armor bare-handed?!

00:15:13.727 --> 00:15:14.796
Incredible.

00:15:14.829 --> 00:15:16.800
Brokeena: The true
power of the Aura.

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:18.035
All: [confused grunts]

00:15:18.068 --> 00:15:19.839
Brokeena: He's overflowing
with so much of it,

00:15:19.873 --> 00:15:22.611
his body has become
harder than steel.

00:15:22.645 --> 00:15:26.418
I'd say he's achieved a power
beyond our wildest imaginations.

00:15:26.451 --> 00:15:28.355
Wait, are you telling
me that you knew

00:15:28.388 --> 00:15:30.093
this was his plan
the whole time?

00:15:30.126 --> 00:15:31.228
Brokeena: Pretty much.

00:15:31.261 --> 00:15:33.866
It was a very risky
gamble on his part,

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.205
but fortunately
he pulled it off...

00:15:36.238 --> 00:15:39.578
And I'm sure they're all
very relieved that he did.

00:15:39.612 --> 00:15:42.350
Huh? Uh, who do
you mean "they"?

00:15:42.383 --> 00:15:46.793
Mystvearn: Why, you
little... How dare you...

00:15:46.826 --> 00:15:50.199
You know my face
shall not be touched!

00:15:50.968 --> 00:15:52.136
Honestly?

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:55.209
Sometimes you push things
a little too far.

00:15:55.242 --> 00:15:57.581
You'd better make
this up to me.

00:15:57.615 --> 00:15:59.117
Thought you were a goner.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.654
How's this sound?

00:16:00.688 --> 00:16:02.057
I'll take care
of these guys,

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:03.994
and then I'll get
you out of there.

00:16:04.027 --> 00:16:07.166
Mystvearn:
You insolent fools!

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.636
That's enough games.

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:12.711
I'm going to tear the both of
you apart, right here and now.

00:16:12.745 --> 00:16:14.715
"Both of us"? Mystvearn...

00:16:14.748 --> 00:16:16.018
Take a breath.

00:16:16.051 --> 00:16:18.824
That temper of yours
really dulls your senses

00:16:18.857 --> 00:16:21.161
when you let it
get the better of you.

00:16:40.133 --> 00:16:41.669
Mystvearn: Well, well...

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.476
Mystvearn: Dai.

00:16:47.681 --> 00:16:49.919
Vearn: So...
the boy lives.

00:16:49.953 --> 00:16:51.656
Killvearn: What did I
tell you, Your Majesty?

00:16:51.689 --> 00:16:55.363
My cards are never wrong.
It's exactly as I predicted.

00:16:55.396 --> 00:16:58.335
Vearn: I can sense
his spirit from here.

00:16:58.369 --> 00:16:59.805
There's something
different about it;

00:16:59.839 --> 00:17:02.209
as if he's an
entirely new being.

00:17:04.616 --> 00:17:06.485
You've found your resolve.

00:17:06.519 --> 00:17:08.288
All right, Dai!

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:16.071
Popp, Leona... Maam?

00:17:16.104 --> 00:17:17.708
Where did you all come from?

00:17:17.741 --> 00:17:18.977
[chuckling]

00:17:19.011 --> 00:17:21.649
We tunneled in just like
you would have, Big Guy.

00:17:21.682 --> 00:17:25.222
Well, I mean, we used my fire
magic instead, but still...

00:17:25.256 --> 00:17:27.493
Let me get those for you.

00:17:27.527 --> 00:17:29.197
[charging roar]

00:17:32.504 --> 00:17:33.606
[relieved sigh]

00:17:34.775 --> 00:17:37.948
Hyunckel: I'm surprised you
didn't jump the gun, Dai.

00:17:37.981 --> 00:17:40.486
Why? I knew
what you were up to.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.223
I could feel
the Aura of Light

00:17:42.257 --> 00:17:44.060
growing stronger
inside of you,

00:17:44.093 --> 00:17:46.398
so I told everybody
to hold their ground.

00:17:46.431 --> 00:17:49.037
At first we weren't quite
sure how to get to you,

00:17:49.071 --> 00:17:50.573
but we figured
an attack from

00:17:50.607 --> 00:17:52.477
underground would be
the best option.

00:17:52.511 --> 00:17:53.780
Makes sense.

00:17:53.814 --> 00:17:55.116
Thank you.

00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:58.422
Could not have done it
without your... belief in me.

00:18:01.128 --> 00:18:03.299
Leona: Yeah,
it wasn't only him

00:18:03.332 --> 00:18:04.835
who believed in you,
you know.

00:18:04.869 --> 00:18:06.404
Just for the record.

00:18:07.608 --> 00:18:08.543
Wait, you mean...

00:18:08.576 --> 00:18:10.580
For what it's worth,
the rest of us thought

00:18:10.614 --> 00:18:12.685
that we should've made
our move the second you

00:18:12.718 --> 00:18:14.956
went all dark-and-screamy
and whatever...

00:18:14.989 --> 00:18:17.728
But somehow, Maam just knew.

00:18:18.563 --> 00:18:20.600
Hyunckel would
never accept it...

00:18:20.634 --> 00:18:23.974
Not unless he knew he could
withstand the Dark Aura

00:18:24.007 --> 00:18:27.814
You know what?
Let's just trust him.

00:18:28.182 --> 00:18:29.318
Lucky guess.

00:18:29.351 --> 00:18:31.021
True, but I was right.

00:18:31.055 --> 00:18:33.325
Yes. I made a solemn vow.

00:18:33.358 --> 00:18:36.666
I will never fight for
the forces of darkness again.

00:18:41.609 --> 00:18:44.480
Speaking of fighting,
this one's not over.

00:18:50.059 --> 00:18:50.960
Nova!

00:18:50.994 --> 00:18:53.867
Did somebody say
fight? I'm in.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.804
'Cause we all ran
out of patience.

00:18:55.837 --> 00:19:01.282
[charging roars]

00:19:01.315 --> 00:19:03.252
Here we go. Showtime.

00:19:03.285 --> 00:19:05.557
Commandos? We charge!

00:19:05.591 --> 00:19:10.601
[roaring]

00:19:10.634 --> 00:19:14.908
[attacking grunts]

00:19:15.878 --> 00:19:18.950
Good luck. We can handle
ourselves. Don't worry.

00:19:20.286 --> 00:19:23.760
Wait, why are you five
leaving the fighting to them?

00:19:23.793 --> 00:19:26.866
It's sorta complicated.
You missed a few things, pal.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.674
Hyunckel, do you still
have your Insignia of Avan?

00:19:30.707 --> 00:19:33.279
Sure. I always carry it.

00:19:33.312 --> 00:19:35.584
King Vearn himself
could strike me down,

00:19:35.617 --> 00:19:38.255
and I still
wouldn't let it go.

00:19:38.288 --> 00:19:40.026
Leona: Okay,
hold it in your hand

00:19:40.059 --> 00:19:41.361
and try to focus your will.

00:19:41.394 --> 00:19:44.835
Focus on my will?
What do you mean?

00:19:44.869 --> 00:19:46.471
Oh, it shouldn't
be difficult.

00:19:46.505 --> 00:19:48.643
Just close your eyes
and try to think about

00:19:48.677 --> 00:19:50.547
whatever it is
that motivates you.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.118
The thing that keeps
you fighting. Easy, right?

00:19:53.151 --> 00:19:54.988
[embarrassed gulp]

00:19:55.022 --> 00:19:56.525
Popp [thought]:
Don't glow...

00:19:56.559 --> 00:19:59.230
Wait - what am
I even saying?

00:19:59.263 --> 00:20:01.502
Sure, if Hyunckel can't
get his Insignia to glow,

00:20:01.536 --> 00:20:03.438
it might let me
off the hook...

00:20:03.472 --> 00:20:05.577
But the spell would
be ruined too.

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:08.248
I'm just the worst, aren't I?

00:20:15.864 --> 00:20:19.939
What's that? What power
is in these pendants?

00:20:19.973 --> 00:20:24.448
It means the Insignia must be
responding to your fortitude.

00:20:24.481 --> 00:20:27.387
Perfect. We're all set.

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.259
Five Disciples
and five Insignias...

00:20:30.292 --> 00:20:33.866
Now we're ready...
to cast the Kaglimmer spell.

00:20:36.271 --> 00:20:38.041
[attacking grunts]

00:20:38.075 --> 00:20:39.444
[snarling]

00:20:39.478 --> 00:20:42.317
Mystvearn: [furious roar]

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:45.657
You'll pay for this,
Hyunckel - and you, Dai.

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:49.330
The two of you have humiliated
me for the last time.

00:20:49.364 --> 00:20:52.436
Vearn: Is something
wrong, Mystvearn?

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:53.874
Mystvearn: My Dark King...

00:20:53.907 --> 00:20:56.345
Why are you so agitated?

00:20:56.378 --> 00:20:58.616
With your power,
you could easily wipe out

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:03.325
the Disciples of Avan
and their meager army.

00:21:03.359 --> 00:21:05.564
And it's not as though
their petty resistance

00:21:05.597 --> 00:21:10.139
will gain them entry to
Vearn Palace, now, is it?

00:21:10.173 --> 00:21:12.410
I suggest you relax.

00:21:12.443 --> 00:21:15.149
Why not take your time
with these pests?

00:21:15.182 --> 00:21:18.355
And show them the
true cost of defiance.

00:21:18.389 --> 00:21:19.424
Mystvearn: My liege.

00:21:19.457 --> 00:21:21.863
Forgive my impatience...

00:21:21.896 --> 00:21:23.733
I shall obey your commands.

00:21:23.766 --> 00:21:25.970
Please, accept my
humble offering...

00:21:26.004 --> 00:21:29.579
The sight of these pathetic
insects writhing in agony...

00:21:29.612 --> 00:21:33.520
And these Disciples destroyed
just like their master.

00:21:33.553 --> 00:21:36.457
Dark Puppetry Aura
Decimation Field!

00:21:38.796 --> 00:21:41.434
Lon Beruk: The Disciples
are a little...

00:21:41.468 --> 00:21:43.573
busy at the moment.

00:21:43.606 --> 00:21:46.545
But I have plenty
of time for you.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:51.121
Lon Beruk: And if
you want to play...
