WEBVTT

00:01:51.557 --> 00:01:53.159
Sizzle!

00:01:53.627 --> 00:01:55.397
[shrieking]

00:01:59.506 --> 00:02:00.407
[shocked gasp]

00:02:01.208 --> 00:02:02.512
[shocked gasp]

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:07.789
Master Avan!

00:02:11.697 --> 00:02:13.199
Is everyone all right?

00:02:13.232 --> 00:02:14.235
That was close.

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:15.972
[confirming grunts]

00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:17.842
Avan: Thank goodness.

00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:20.246
That's what I call
good timing...

00:02:20.748 --> 00:02:21.550
Both: Master!

00:02:21.583 --> 00:02:22.552
[impressed huff]

00:02:22.586 --> 00:02:25.257
I didn't think he'd have
the strength to do it.

00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:27.929
[exhausted breaths]

00:02:27.962 --> 00:02:30.434
Are you okay?
That must've hurt.

00:02:30.467 --> 00:02:33.173
Avan: Yes, it certainly did...

00:02:33.206 --> 00:02:35.477
But I don't have
time for that now.

00:02:35.512 --> 00:02:37.414
His powers have
grown much stronger

00:02:37.448 --> 00:02:39.251
since our last encounter.

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:43.426
Avan: Not only that, he has
the Dark King backing him.

00:02:43.894 --> 00:02:44.630
[frightened yell]

00:02:44.663 --> 00:02:46.332
I'm afraid
this is going to be

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:49.071
much more difficult
than I expected.

00:02:49.104 --> 00:02:51.810
If we don't do
something drastic....

00:02:52.812 --> 00:02:54.015
We can't win this.

00:02:54.048 --> 00:02:55.283
Master!

00:02:55.316 --> 00:02:58.223
Hadlar will shroud this
world in darkness again...

00:02:58.256 --> 00:03:00.360
And I can't allow
that to happen.

00:03:00.393 --> 00:03:03.099
He must be stopped
here and now.

00:03:03.132 --> 00:03:07.008
Dai... Popp...
Promise me something.

00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:08.611
No matter what happens,

00:03:08.644 --> 00:03:11.683
find the Dark King Vearn
and defeat him.

00:03:12.017 --> 00:03:13.386
[gasps]

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:21.169
I underestimated you.

00:03:21.202 --> 00:03:23.273
You are willing
to pay the price.

00:03:23.306 --> 00:03:24.609
Wait a minute...

00:03:24.642 --> 00:03:26.947
Are you not coming
back from this?

00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:29.819
What?! Hold on,
I'll fight with you!

00:03:31.088 --> 00:03:32.525
Avan: Kaclang!

00:03:34.963 --> 00:03:36.199
What's happening?!

00:03:36.232 --> 00:03:37.636
A Kaclang spell!

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:38.705
Never heard of it.

00:03:38.738 --> 00:03:41.142
It's a high-level
defensive incantation.

00:03:41.176 --> 00:03:45.751
It turns the body into steel and
can repel any magical attack!

00:03:47.556 --> 00:03:49.325
But if we're turned
into steel...

00:03:49.358 --> 00:03:50.961
We can't move!

00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:54.335
I'm sorry, but it's
the only way.

00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:56.439
I have to make
sure you'll all be safe

00:03:56.472 --> 00:03:58.376
before I begin
this final battle.

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.648
Wait! It doesn't
have to be final.

00:04:00.682 --> 00:04:02.685
He's right. We can
beat him, together.

00:04:02.718 --> 00:04:04.989
Just please don't
do this, Master!

00:04:05.023 --> 00:04:07.027
Still as foolish
as ever, Avan...

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.001
Wasting what's left of your
Magic Power on these weaklings.

00:04:24.361 --> 00:04:25.598
Popp: Really?

00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:29.271
Insignias of Avan!
Those are graduation pendants!

00:04:29.304 --> 00:04:30.406
They're what?

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.177
Avan: I give one
to every student

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.850
who manages to complete
my training...

00:04:34.883 --> 00:04:39.358
And Dai? You possess truly
outstanding potential.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.302
It's only been three days,

00:04:44.335 --> 00:04:46.573
and I regret having
to cut things short.

00:04:46.606 --> 00:04:50.013
If we continued for
the remaining four...

00:04:50.046 --> 00:04:51.382
There's no doubt in my mind

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:53.386
that you would
have become a Hero.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.423
Dai: Master Avan...

00:04:55.456 --> 00:04:57.529
That is why I give
it to you now.

00:04:57.562 --> 00:04:59.532
Keep practicing,
have faith in yourself,

00:04:59.566 --> 00:05:02.739
and one day you
will become a Hero.

00:05:02.772 --> 00:05:04.542
Dai: Master.... I-

00:05:05.878 --> 00:05:06.947
You too, Popp.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.917
Stop it!

00:05:09.787 --> 00:05:12.959
Master, don't do it!
I still need you.

00:05:12.992 --> 00:05:15.832
Popp: Our training isn't
anywhere near finished...

00:05:15.865 --> 00:05:16.534
C'mon...

00:05:16.567 --> 00:05:18.436
quit being so morbid.

00:05:19.973 --> 00:05:20.908
Oh, Popp...

00:05:20.941 --> 00:05:23.514
I don't care if you
used to be the big Hero.

00:05:23.548 --> 00:05:25.585
Now you're supposed
to be our trainer.

00:05:25.618 --> 00:05:30.160
You even said so yourself-
you can't win against him.

00:05:30.194 --> 00:05:32.330
I still have to try, Popp.

00:05:32.364 --> 00:05:34.903
Sometimes you have
to risk everything.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.578
I wish that weren't the case,

00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:40.815
but don't forget the
first thing I taught you:

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:44.054
We train to help others,
not to save ourselves.

00:05:44.088 --> 00:05:46.760
Avan: Perhaps I only received
my abilities to make sure

00:05:46.793 --> 00:05:51.101
the two of you survive and go
on to destroy the Dark King.

00:05:51.135 --> 00:05:53.641
I'm begging you,
change us back!

00:05:53.674 --> 00:05:56.947
You know I can't, but
someday you'll understand.

00:05:56.981 --> 00:05:58.183
And until that day comes,

00:05:58.216 --> 00:06:00.754
I want you to
hold onto this for me.

00:06:02.357 --> 00:06:03.994
Master!

00:06:04.027 --> 00:06:05.330
You can't leave.

00:06:05.363 --> 00:06:06.499
Goodness me.

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:08.704
You two haven't even
officially graduated yet

00:06:08.737 --> 00:06:11.844
and you're already
so emotional.

00:06:11.877 --> 00:06:15.250
If you both intend to become
Heroes worthy of those pendants,

00:06:15.283 --> 00:06:17.387
then you're going to
have to push each other

00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:18.757
to toughen up, huh?

00:06:19.926 --> 00:06:24.702
Shaman Brass, Gomechan,
thank you both for everything.

00:06:24.736 --> 00:06:28.210
Master Avan,
don't do anything rash!

00:06:28.243 --> 00:06:29.679
I've thought it all through.

00:06:29.712 --> 00:06:32.952
You have my word.
He won't win.

00:06:37.762 --> 00:06:40.935
So, is the farewell
party over?

00:06:40.968 --> 00:06:43.439
Let's do this, Hadlar.

00:06:43.472 --> 00:06:44.475
[amused chuckle]

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:45.845
Hadlar: As you wish...

00:06:45.878 --> 00:06:48.349
But we both know you sealed
your fate when you wasted

00:06:48.382 --> 00:06:51.823
the last of your Magic Power
to cast Kaclang.

00:06:51.856 --> 00:06:54.294
You've spent most
of yours, too.

00:06:54.328 --> 00:06:56.599
But I still have
a few surprises.

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:14.101
Avan: Here goes!

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.205
[battle cry]

00:07:18.442 --> 00:07:19.846
[pained grunt]

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:22.818
You fool!

00:07:24.523 --> 00:07:25.991
Hadlar: As we fight...

00:07:26.025 --> 00:07:28.597
Even just hand-to-hand...

00:07:29.932 --> 00:07:32.338
I still have more
than enough...

00:07:32.371 --> 00:07:34.008
Power to break you...

00:07:34.041 --> 00:07:37.848
into tiny little pieces!

00:07:44.562 --> 00:07:46.498
[pained yell]

00:07:49.171 --> 00:07:50.440
Popp: Come on!

00:07:50.473 --> 00:07:52.678
Dai: Move! You've gotta move!

00:07:53.613 --> 00:07:56.519
[charging roar]

00:07:57.187 --> 00:07:58.590
[roaring]

00:08:08.275 --> 00:08:09.277
[worried gasps]

00:08:09.311 --> 00:08:10.080
[chuckle]

00:08:10.113 --> 00:08:12.718
Goodbye, Avan!

00:08:19.198 --> 00:08:20.567
But how?

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.081
[agonized cry]

00:08:27.114 --> 00:08:29.685
A spell?! Impossible!

00:08:30.755 --> 00:08:32.291
Hadlar: There's no
way you've conserved

00:08:32.324 --> 00:08:33.761
enough Magic Power for this!

00:08:33.794 --> 00:08:35.898
Actually, this spell
requires very little.

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:39.004
Instead, it turns life
energy into a massive blast.

00:08:39.037 --> 00:08:41.843
So let's see you
withstand this, Hadlar!

00:08:42.746 --> 00:08:46.686
Wait! You know
what that means-

00:08:47.087 --> 00:08:48.423
[roaring]

00:08:48.456 --> 00:08:50.694
Stop it! You little...

00:08:50.728 --> 00:08:52.999
[struggling grunts]

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:55.470
Hadlar: Enough!
It will kill you, too!

00:08:55.505 --> 00:08:57.775
Is that really
what you want?

00:09:03.052 --> 00:09:04.689
Popp, Dai - good luck!

00:09:04.722 --> 00:09:06.860
You'll have to
take it from here!

00:09:07.394 --> 00:09:09.264
No!

00:09:09.298 --> 00:09:13.239
[roaring]

00:09:15.243 --> 00:09:16.713
Avan: Megante!

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:27.367
[explosion]

00:09:48.309 --> 00:09:49.211
He's gone...

00:09:49.244 --> 00:09:50.147
No...

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.587
I can't believe he
cast a Megante spell.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.023
Popp: Megante?

00:09:55.056 --> 00:09:57.294
It's an old
self-destruct spell.

00:09:57.327 --> 00:09:58.495
He sacrificed himself

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:02.070
to keep the world from falling
back into Hadlar's hands.

00:10:02.103 --> 00:10:05.210
Master Avan was
truly a selfless Hero.

00:10:05.243 --> 00:10:08.349
Wait - are you saying that
he threw away his own life,

00:10:08.383 --> 00:10:10.052
just to protect us?

00:10:11.523 --> 00:10:12.825
Dai: Master...

00:10:28.623 --> 00:10:29.926
[nervous grunts]

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.030
Please tell me
that's our master?!

00:10:35.938 --> 00:10:38.309
[roaring]

00:10:38.777 --> 00:10:40.514
Both: He's alive?!

00:10:40.547 --> 00:10:43.687
[heavy breathing]

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.024
Oh, no. What do we do now?!

00:10:49.298 --> 00:10:55.544
[chuckling]

00:10:55.578 --> 00:10:59.351
Oh, Avan. You truly
have grown weak!

00:10:59.384 --> 00:11:02.257
Hadlar: Even with all your life
force in that Megante spell,

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:05.363
you couldn't hold
a candle to my power!

00:11:05.397 --> 00:11:07.267
[cackling]

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.407
And if it's only children
standing in my way, now...

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.243
I have nothing to fear!

00:11:12.277 --> 00:11:13.446
[cackling]

00:11:13.479 --> 00:11:15.584
He truly is a monster.

00:11:15.618 --> 00:11:17.287
And now we're alone.

00:11:17.321 --> 00:11:20.460
[cackling]

00:11:20.493 --> 00:11:22.331
[pained groan]

00:11:22.364 --> 00:11:24.802
Curse that pesky Hero!

00:11:31.716 --> 00:11:34.121
You may have left
me with this headache,

00:11:34.154 --> 00:11:38.196
but it's your students who
are going to pay the price.

00:11:38.229 --> 00:11:39.164
[terrified shriek]

00:11:40.535 --> 00:11:41.503
Brass: Don't worry, boys!

00:11:41.536 --> 00:11:42.738
We're still under
the protection

00:11:42.772 --> 00:11:44.943
of Master Avan's
Kaclang spell.

00:11:44.976 --> 00:11:46.278
As long as it holds up,

00:11:46.312 --> 00:11:48.884
we'll be safe from
whatever he throws at us.

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:50.119
Hadlar: You say that...

00:11:50.152 --> 00:11:52.825
But now you
also can't run away.

00:11:52.859 --> 00:11:55.263
And that's perfect for me.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.171
Oh, great. Frizz spells, too?!

00:11:59.204 --> 00:12:02.477
Hadlar: Of course, and my
Frizz is pure hellfire.

00:12:02.511 --> 00:12:05.483
It won't stop burning
until its target is destroyed.

00:12:05.518 --> 00:12:08.557
It's only a matter of time
until Avan's spell wears off,

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:10.527
and you're turned to ashes.

00:12:10.561 --> 00:12:12.932
Don't do it - please,
just leave!

00:12:12.965 --> 00:12:15.504
Well, in a way,
I am sparing you.

00:12:15.537 --> 00:12:18.042
Soon, you'll be in
the afterlife...

00:12:18.076 --> 00:12:20.681
Your precious master
is already there,

00:12:20.714 --> 00:12:23.018
waiting to welcome you all.

00:12:23.887 --> 00:12:25.389
Dai [thought]:
Master Avan didn't just

00:12:25.423 --> 00:12:27.027
give up his life
to stop Hadlar.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.899
He gave up his life so
that we'd survive...

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.838
[menacing chuckle]

00:12:32.871 --> 00:12:34.943
Dai [thought]: If we don't
finish what he started,

00:12:34.976 --> 00:12:37.948
then his sacrifice
will have been for nothing.

00:12:39.652 --> 00:12:41.221
[frustrated growl]

00:12:46.633 --> 00:12:48.302
I owe him my life...

00:12:48.336 --> 00:12:51.375
And I'm not going to let
this jerk take it away now.

00:13:01.228 --> 00:13:02.965
Hadlar [thought]:
It can't be...

00:13:02.999 --> 00:13:06.071
He intends to break the
Kaclang spell himself?!

00:13:08.142 --> 00:13:10.046
[roaring]

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.751
Incredible... What is he?

00:13:12.785 --> 00:13:16.458
[roaring]

00:13:18.764 --> 00:13:20.701
How could Dai
shatter that spell?

00:13:20.734 --> 00:13:22.470
You stupid child.

00:13:23.205 --> 00:13:25.276
Now you'll fry.

00:13:25.309 --> 00:13:28.182
Kafrizz!

00:13:28.684 --> 00:13:29.952
Kacrack!

00:13:38.637 --> 00:13:40.440
He's using magic?!

00:13:40.473 --> 00:13:42.143
And it's stronger than mine!

00:13:42.177 --> 00:13:44.314
You can't quench hellfire!

00:13:44.348 --> 00:13:45.483
Fine then.

00:13:45.517 --> 00:13:48.355
I guess I'm just going to
have to pummel you to death!

00:13:49.324 --> 00:13:51.094
Now, die!

00:14:05.524 --> 00:14:08.128
What kind of power is this?

00:14:09.632 --> 00:14:14.307
Hadlar: Unbelievable!
Where did that mark come from?

00:14:24.427 --> 00:14:26.966
Hadlar: A dragon?

00:14:29.772 --> 00:14:31.743
Popp: Why is he glowing?

00:14:31.777 --> 00:14:32.945
Brass: I'm not sure,

00:14:32.979 --> 00:14:34.849
but it's not the first
time this has happened.

00:14:34.883 --> 00:14:35.884
Before you arrived,

00:14:35.918 --> 00:14:37.655
he unleashed
this force in battle.

00:14:37.688 --> 00:14:41.061
And the same mark appeared on
his forehead then, too!

00:14:41.094 --> 00:14:43.566
Hadlar [thought]: How did
he get a Dragon Crest?

00:14:44.636 --> 00:14:45.937
Could this boy really be

00:14:45.971 --> 00:14:47.908
a descendent of
the Dragon Knights?

00:14:47.942 --> 00:14:49.210
I don't believe it.

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:52.951
How dare you.

00:14:53.621 --> 00:14:55.590
Avan was my master.

00:14:56.492 --> 00:14:57.694
You'll pay for that.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.237
Enough of your
arrogance, little boy!

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.007
[charging roar]

00:15:07.915 --> 00:15:10.520
[pained yell]

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:13.392
Nice one, Dai!

00:15:13.425 --> 00:15:14.963
How could this be?

00:15:14.996 --> 00:15:19.305
I know I sustained some
damage from Avan's Megante...

00:15:19.338 --> 00:15:22.377
And this boy may be one
of his students...

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:25.082
But that still doesn't explain
how I was overpowered...

00:15:25.116 --> 00:15:28.021
By a simple, little child!

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:33.131
Come on!

00:15:37.541 --> 00:15:39.077
Will you hold still?!

00:15:43.587 --> 00:15:45.557
Take this!

00:15:45.924 --> 00:15:47.226
Boom!

00:15:52.738 --> 00:15:53.907
Not good!

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.376
Oh, no - Dai!

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:00.954
Did you like that?

00:16:00.987 --> 00:16:04.595
I used the last of my
Magic Power on that spell.

00:16:05.129 --> 00:16:07.433
Surely, he's dead now.

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:11.074
[cackling]

00:16:11.108 --> 00:16:14.615
No, no... Don't tell me
this creep killed Dai, too.

00:16:14.648 --> 00:16:18.890
I sure did. And guess who's
next on my chopping block?

00:16:18.924 --> 00:16:27.741
[cackling]

00:16:32.584 --> 00:16:34.454
It's not possible!

00:16:47.948 --> 00:16:49.785
[frustrated roar]

00:16:50.921 --> 00:16:52.424
I won't lose...

00:16:52.457 --> 00:16:54.260
Not to you!

00:17:04.247 --> 00:17:06.285
I'm not finished yet.

00:17:06.318 --> 00:17:08.022
Above you - look out!

00:17:08.055 --> 00:17:10.760
Master Avan was
not weak at all...

00:17:14.134 --> 00:17:18.041
Dai: Feel his power
for yourself!

00:17:19.612 --> 00:17:20.548
What?!

00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:21.816
Avan...

00:17:24.822 --> 00:17:27.661
Strash!

00:17:34.173 --> 00:17:36.144
[pained yell]

00:17:38.181 --> 00:17:40.654
[pained yell]

00:17:40.688 --> 00:17:42.390
I won't forget this!

00:17:42.424 --> 00:17:46.197
I promise, you've just made
yourself a life-long enemy.

00:17:46.231 --> 00:17:49.103
I swear that
I will kill you, Dai!

00:18:14.054 --> 00:18:17.059
-[delighted chuckle]
-[excited chirping]

00:18:17.093 --> 00:18:18.563
Brass: Are you all right?

00:18:19.899 --> 00:18:22.203
I think so... Are you guys?

00:18:23.573 --> 00:18:24.575
Where's Hadlar?

00:18:24.609 --> 00:18:27.380
Unfortunately,
I think he got away.

00:18:27.413 --> 00:18:30.754
If I'm not mistaken,
he used a Chimaera Wing.

00:18:30.787 --> 00:18:32.156
But I had him!

00:18:32.558 --> 00:18:37.701
[crying]

00:18:37.734 --> 00:18:39.404
Master Avan...

00:18:39.905 --> 00:18:41.307
Popp: Come back.

00:18:42.979 --> 00:18:44.447
Come back!

00:18:44.481 --> 00:18:53.298
[sobbing]

00:19:00.112 --> 00:19:02.651
The Hero Avan may
no longer be with us,

00:19:02.684 --> 00:19:06.158
but his magic circle
continues to shine brightly.

00:19:06.191 --> 00:19:09.665
He's still
protecting us, even now.

00:19:09.698 --> 00:19:12.605
Popp: I told you guys
that he was amazing.

00:19:12.638 --> 00:19:14.440
Dai: Popp...

00:19:14.474 --> 00:19:16.879
So... What will
you do now, Dai?

00:19:16.913 --> 00:19:17.748
Huh?

00:19:17.781 --> 00:19:18.750
After all this,

00:19:18.784 --> 00:19:21.421
you could keep training
to be a mage under me.

00:19:21.455 --> 00:19:24.227
However...
the world needs a new Hero.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.563
I'm not sure...

00:19:29.004 --> 00:19:30.774
But I promised Master Avan.

00:19:30.807 --> 00:19:33.279
Someone has to stop
the Dark King Vearn,

00:19:33.312 --> 00:19:35.182
and I guess that's me.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.426
So that means...
It's time.

00:19:55.657 --> 00:19:59.397
Vearn: I see you've taken
quite the beating, Hadlar.

00:19:59.431 --> 00:20:02.270
Hadlar: Please...
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

00:20:02.303 --> 00:20:05.511
I hope my condition
doesn't offend your gaze.

00:20:05.544 --> 00:20:07.914
Vearn: Oh,
quite the contrary.

00:20:07.948 --> 00:20:10.521
You have buried
the Hero, Avan.

00:20:10.554 --> 00:20:15.329
I would consider them...
wounds of honor.

00:20:16.498 --> 00:20:19.938
I'm glad to have placed all
my trust in such a warrior.

00:20:19.972 --> 00:20:21.475
With your rival
out of the way,

00:20:21.509 --> 00:20:25.049
there is no one left
who can stop my Dark Army.

00:20:25.082 --> 00:20:30.593
So go forth and fulfill your
dream of overthrowing the world.

00:20:30.961 --> 00:20:32.429
Sire!

00:20:36.438 --> 00:20:39.010
Hadlar [thought]:
Avan may finally be gone,

00:20:39.043 --> 00:20:41.347
but something tells me
that his protege

00:20:41.381 --> 00:20:44.153
is going to be a
far greater threat.

00:20:44.187 --> 00:20:46.291
It was only
because of my wounds,

00:20:46.325 --> 00:20:49.330
but I still cannot abide
a child defeating me-

00:20:49.364 --> 00:20:52.705
the Commander of King
Vearn's Dark Legions...

00:20:52.738 --> 00:20:55.409
That mark on his
forehead bothers me...

00:20:55.442 --> 00:20:58.315
The Dragon Crest.

00:20:58.348 --> 00:21:00.854
If he really is the spawn
of the Dragon Knights...

00:21:00.887 --> 00:21:03.993
And he manages to attain
the power of a Hero

00:21:04.026 --> 00:21:07.400
thanks to Avan's
training, well...

00:21:07.433 --> 00:21:09.270
He could become more powerful

00:21:09.304 --> 00:21:11.976
than any other
warrior in history.

00:21:13.311 --> 00:21:15.449
These wounds aren't an honor;

00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:18.021
they're a warning
of things to come...

00:21:18.055 --> 00:21:19.591
And there's a reason
the boy's damage

00:21:19.625 --> 00:21:22.496
is healing slower than his
precious master's.

00:21:22.531 --> 00:21:24.936
The little wretch has
already surpassed Avan

00:21:24.969 --> 00:21:26.839
when it comes to swordplay.

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:36.424
If I let him live,
then he'll keep training,

00:21:36.458 --> 00:21:39.765
and soon he'll become an
even more formidable enemy.

00:21:47.948 --> 00:21:52.824
So I'll just have to destroy him
while he remains a fledgling.

00:21:58.636 --> 00:22:03.411
Hadlar: My grand Dark Army,
are you ready?!

00:23:37.133 --> 00:23:38.937
Narrator: With fresh
determination in their hearts,

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:41.408
Dai and Popp set sail
on a new adventure.

00:23:41.441 --> 00:23:43.011
But on their way
to Romos Kingdom,

00:23:43.044 --> 00:23:45.348
they find themselves
lost in the Dark Forest,

00:23:45.382 --> 00:23:47.954
and encounter a
warrior named Maam.

00:23:47.987 --> 00:23:48.956
Before too long,

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:51.261
a terrifying beast comes
searching for a meal,

00:23:51.295 --> 00:23:54.535
and one of Hadlar's underlings
comes hunting for our Hero...

00:23:54.568 --> 00:23:56.404
Will Dai and his friends
escape the woods?

00:23:56.437 --> 00:23:57.908
Find out on
the next episode of

00:23:57.941 --> 00:24:00.446
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:00.479 --> 00:24:03.151
"Crocodine, the Beast King".
