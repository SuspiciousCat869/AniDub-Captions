WEBVTT

00:01:50.822 --> 00:01:53.861
Hyunckel [thought]: This is
the Dragon Legion's handiwork.

00:01:53.894 --> 00:01:56.132
While we were
fighting Flazzard,

00:01:56.165 --> 00:01:58.469
they destroyed Carl Kingdom.

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.817
The Order of Carl was supposed
to be the strongest of them all.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.285
And still...

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.728
Soldier: I have a request.

00:02:10.762 --> 00:02:14.269
My brother's body should
be somewhere in the palace.

00:02:14.302 --> 00:02:16.373
I'd like to bury him.

00:02:16.406 --> 00:02:18.076
Horkins was his name.

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:20.180
The knight captain
of this kingdom.

00:02:20.213 --> 00:02:21.817
He was a hero.

00:02:21.851 --> 00:02:25.190
People knew his name
even in neighboring kingdoms.

00:02:25.223 --> 00:02:28.196
He fought off the
dragons valiantly,

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.234
but the enemy
Legion Commander...

00:02:30.267 --> 00:02:32.806
he killed my brother.

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:33.707
Hyunckel [thought]: Baran...

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.447
I'd never seen anything
like it before.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.556
[roaring]

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.177
Soldier: My brother matched
him in skill with a sword.

00:02:52.645 --> 00:02:53.881
But then he...

00:02:56.787 --> 00:02:58.223
You sheath your blade?

00:02:58.256 --> 00:02:59.959
You coward!

00:03:11.115 --> 00:03:12.318
Soldier: One shot.

00:03:12.351 --> 00:03:16.292
With one shot,
the man I knew was gone.

00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:20.868
There.

00:03:20.902 --> 00:03:22.805
I can't get him out alone.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.220
What? This shape...

00:03:30.253 --> 00:03:32.558
It's the same as Dai's mark.

00:03:33.861 --> 00:03:35.765
Dai: Serve you?

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.537
Destroy the human world?!

00:03:39.004 --> 00:03:39.940
You're joking.

00:03:39.974 --> 00:03:41.610
I make no such joke.

00:03:41.643 --> 00:03:43.815
It's what the
legendary Dragon Knights

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:45.952
were born to do, after all.

00:03:45.985 --> 00:03:47.121
What?

00:03:47.154 --> 00:03:49.926
Baran: So you
have not learned, yet.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.496
Very well.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.969
I will teach you everything that
the Dragon Crystal did not.

00:03:56.807 --> 00:04:02.084
Baran: Long ago, when the
gods first created this world,

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:05.190
three species ruled the land:

00:04:05.223 --> 00:04:10.000
the humans, the Darklings,
and the dragons.

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:13.473
These days, dragons are
considered a type of monster,

00:04:13.507 --> 00:04:15.711
but they used to be
smarter than humans,

00:04:15.744 --> 00:04:18.717
and most of them
could even speak.

00:04:20.387 --> 00:04:22.725
These three species
fought bloody battles

00:04:22.758 --> 00:04:25.765
for control of
the ancient world.

00:04:25.798 --> 00:04:27.735
The gods lamented
this conflict,

00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:31.442
and decided someone should
oversee their creation.

00:04:33.781 --> 00:04:36.352
The gods of Dragons,
Darklings, and humans

00:04:36.385 --> 00:04:39.425
convened and came
to an agreement...

00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:42.464
To create a being with
the strength of dragons,

00:04:42.497 --> 00:04:47.240
the Magic Power of Darklings,
and the heart of humans.

00:04:47.274 --> 00:04:50.346
An ultimate warrior.

00:04:52.351 --> 00:04:54.756
The Dragon Knight.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.498
If any force should ever hold
ambitions to dominate the world,

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:02.437
it is the Dragon Knight's
duty to wipe them out

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.644
and administer
divine punishment.

00:05:06.914 --> 00:05:08.818
Well, if what you're
telling me is true,

00:05:08.851 --> 00:05:11.422
isn't the Dark King
Vearn the real problem?

00:05:11.455 --> 00:05:13.627
He's the one who's trying
to conquer the world!

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.299
No, the humans
are the evil ones.

00:05:16.332 --> 00:05:18.604
King Vearn only
seeks to wipe them out

00:05:18.637 --> 00:05:21.275
for the sake of
the rest of the world.

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:22.277
But, I...

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.381
You must quickly
embrace your role.

00:05:24.415 --> 00:05:27.588
Understand the proper
duties of a Dragon Knight...

00:05:27.622 --> 00:05:30.728
And offer King Vearn
your loyalty.

00:05:30.761 --> 00:05:31.930
Never!

00:05:33.033 --> 00:05:35.203
I'm on the side of humanity
no matter what you say.

00:05:35.236 --> 00:05:39.078
It was the Dark Army that
took my Master Avan's life.

00:05:39.111 --> 00:05:40.849
I'd rather die!

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:41.950
I see.

00:05:42.718 --> 00:05:44.956
Dai: Dragon Legion
Commander Baran,

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.660
take this!

00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:49.464
Avan Strash!

00:05:55.043 --> 00:05:56.780
It didn't work?!

00:05:56.813 --> 00:05:59.485
I would rather
not have to harm you,

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:02.692
but if this is
truly how you feel...

00:06:02.725 --> 00:06:05.998
I will have to take
you with me by force.

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:08.871
[snarling]

00:06:08.904 --> 00:06:12.043
Dragon crystal:
Impossible! How can this be?

00:06:14.315 --> 00:06:16.385
[concerned breaths]

00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:18.089
Popp: What's going
on down there?

00:06:18.123 --> 00:06:19.058
This is...

00:06:19.091 --> 00:06:20.360
I sense it.

00:06:20.393 --> 00:06:22.766
A being with massive power.

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:24.101
Uh... What?

00:06:26.305 --> 00:06:27.808
[startled cries]

00:06:29.445 --> 00:06:31.316
Look! Is that Dai?!

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:32.284
Popp: Dai...

00:06:32.317 --> 00:06:33.520
No...

00:06:34.823 --> 00:06:35.891
Dai!

00:06:37.895 --> 00:06:39.098
Popp: Hey...

00:06:39.131 --> 00:06:40.601
Are you okay?

00:06:46.514 --> 00:06:47.715
Popp: That crest...

00:06:47.748 --> 00:06:50.654
So he's a Dragon
Knight, as well?!

00:06:50.688 --> 00:06:53.627
Dai: He's part
of the Dark Army...

00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:57.234
Dragon Legion
Commander Baran.

00:06:57.267 --> 00:06:58.336
Leona: What?!

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.107
Popp: Then the Dark
Army has their own

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.376
Dragon Knight as well?

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:02.578
It can't be.

00:07:02.612 --> 00:07:05.684
Only one Dragon Knight
is supposed to exist!

00:07:06.553 --> 00:07:08.558
Huh? Wait but...

00:07:08.591 --> 00:07:10.193
Baran: The girl is correct.

00:07:10.227 --> 00:07:12.632
I am a true Dragon Knight-

00:07:12.666 --> 00:07:15.303
created by the gods to
watch over this world.

00:07:15.336 --> 00:07:19.512
But, there exists an anomaly.

00:07:19.545 --> 00:07:22.417
This boy, this
friend of yours...

00:07:22.451 --> 00:07:25.123
He is a Dragon
Knight by blood.

00:07:25.156 --> 00:07:29.031
Baran: It's time. Time for
you to embrace your duties!

00:07:29.064 --> 00:07:32.037
And destroy what's left
of humanity with me!

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:33.206
What? Come on!

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.043
Look - I already told you.

00:07:35.076 --> 00:07:36.714
I will never do that!

00:07:36.747 --> 00:07:38.650
Not right now, perhaps.

00:07:38.684 --> 00:07:40.287
During the early
years of childhood,

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.493
a Dragon Knight is no
different from a normal human.

00:07:43.527 --> 00:07:44.996
But as you grow older,

00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:48.103
and begin to exhibit
the Power of Dragons,

00:07:48.136 --> 00:07:53.647
humans will start to fear,
reject, and persecute you.

00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:57.988
When that happens, you will
be the one to suffer.

00:07:59.257 --> 00:08:02.230
Girl: I'm scared.
He's so scary!

00:08:04.335 --> 00:08:05.838
Popp: Screw your nonsense.

00:08:05.871 --> 00:08:07.942
Dai is our friend-
you understand?!

00:08:07.975 --> 00:08:11.750
No matter what he is,
we'll never persecute him.

00:08:11.783 --> 00:08:13.954
Help you destroy the humans?!

00:08:13.988 --> 00:08:18.396
Dai would... Dai
would never do that.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:19.633
Popp, I...

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.469
Princess, cast Fullheal.

00:08:21.503 --> 00:08:22.437
Got it!

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.809
I'll... I'll try
to deal with him.

00:08:24.842 --> 00:08:28.182
It's so sad to see someone
overestimate themselves.

00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:30.954
[roaring]

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.892
Donk!

00:08:36.666 --> 00:08:37.769
Leona: Fullheal!

00:08:37.802 --> 00:08:40.273
Perfect. That should
patch him right up!

00:08:42.645 --> 00:08:44.114
[astounded gasp]

00:08:53.432 --> 00:08:54.569
[frightened yelp]

00:08:54.602 --> 00:08:57.340
But that spell took down
three Green Dragons!

00:08:57.373 --> 00:08:58.543
Are you kidding?

00:08:58.577 --> 00:09:00.080
You seriously thought
that a Legion Commander

00:09:00.113 --> 00:09:02.552
who leads Dragons could
be weaker than one?

00:09:02.585 --> 00:09:03.486
Popp: Princess, hurry!

00:09:03.521 --> 00:09:05.525
Leona: I'm trying, but...

00:09:05.558 --> 00:09:07.795
Baran: It is
futile to resist!

00:09:10.367 --> 00:09:11.102
My spell!

00:09:11.135 --> 00:09:12.303
[pained groans]

00:09:36.085 --> 00:09:38.222
Popp: A-Aw, man...

00:09:38.723 --> 00:09:40.393
Hang on, Dai!

00:09:40.427 --> 00:09:42.531
I will be taking
the boy with me.

00:09:42.565 --> 00:09:45.003
Leona: No, you
can't have him!

00:09:45.036 --> 00:09:47.407
You may have something
in common with Dai,

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.447
but that does not give you
the right to just take him!

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.319
You're mistaken. I do.

00:09:53.352 --> 00:09:54.254
How's that?

00:09:54.287 --> 00:09:55.490
The truth is;

00:09:55.524 --> 00:09:57.393
This boy... is my son.

00:09:58.764 --> 00:10:03.641
W-What? What did
you just say?

00:10:03.674 --> 00:10:06.914
I said that this boy,
Dai, is my son.

00:10:06.947 --> 00:10:08.550
[gasps]

00:10:08.583 --> 00:10:10.954
Baran: His real name is Dino.

00:10:11.623 --> 00:10:13.994
Dai: H-He's lying!

00:10:14.028 --> 00:10:17.502
Your son? So,
Dai is your son?

00:10:17.535 --> 00:10:20.306
Popp: And we're just
supposed to believe you?

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.077
Well, I say you're a liar!

00:10:22.111 --> 00:10:26.152
Dai told me that he washed up on
Dermline Island as an infant.

00:10:26.185 --> 00:10:27.822
What proof do you have?

00:10:27.856 --> 00:10:29.559
The crest on his forehead

00:10:29.592 --> 00:10:32.031
should be more than
proof enough for you.

00:10:32.064 --> 00:10:35.203
Only one person in
the world aside from me

00:10:35.236 --> 00:10:37.106
could have the Dragon Crest.

00:10:38.008 --> 00:10:41.282
The son I lost
eleven years ago.

00:10:41.315 --> 00:10:42.919
My boy, Dino.

00:10:42.952 --> 00:10:45.457
Then, you're certain
that you're the only

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:47.394
bloodline of
the Dragon Knight?

00:10:47.427 --> 00:10:49.064
What if you're wrong?!

00:10:49.866 --> 00:10:51.870
Wait... What
about his mother?

00:10:51.903 --> 00:10:54.675
Where is the woman
who gave birth to him?

00:10:55.912 --> 00:10:57.649
The boy's mother...

00:10:57.682 --> 00:10:59.085
The child does indeed

00:10:59.118 --> 00:11:02.257
bear a striking
resemblance to his mother.

00:11:04.061 --> 00:11:08.737
However... that's of
no concern to you humans.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:13.046
Zaboera: Astonishing!
So Baran is Dai's father?

00:11:13.079 --> 00:11:15.149
Piroro: Father and son.
Dragon Knights.

00:11:15.183 --> 00:11:16.419
Killvearn: Correct.

00:11:16.452 --> 00:11:18.156
Over a decade has passed and

00:11:18.189 --> 00:11:22.330
now we are witness
to the tearful reunion.

00:11:22.364 --> 00:11:24.234
But don't forget
that I'm the one

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:27.040
who arranged this
emotional moment.

00:11:27.073 --> 00:11:31.182
After all, I uncovered the
truth that a certain coward

00:11:31.215 --> 00:11:33.052
in our ranks was hiding.

00:11:33.085 --> 00:11:33.820
How dare you!

00:11:33.854 --> 00:11:34.990
Mystvearn: Silence.

00:11:35.023 --> 00:11:36.693
Mystvearn:
The great Dark King

00:11:36.727 --> 00:11:39.297
shall grace us with
his presence now.

00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:41.435
Contain yourselves.

00:11:42.137 --> 00:11:42.838
Zaboera: My king!

00:11:42.872 --> 00:11:44.174
Hadlar [thought]: You rat.

00:11:49.051 --> 00:11:51.889
Mystvearn: We welcome
you, Your Grace.

00:11:56.599 --> 00:11:59.471
Vearn: Well done, all of you.

00:11:59.506 --> 00:12:02.277
You may raise your heads.

00:12:03.614 --> 00:12:04.716
Hadlar [thought]: Up close,

00:12:04.749 --> 00:12:07.921
the aura from him is
as powerful as ever.

00:12:09.124 --> 00:12:13.265
Vearn: I see things are
getting interesting.

00:12:13.298 --> 00:12:14.334
Killvearn: Yes.

00:12:14.367 --> 00:12:16.840
There has been some
debate among the commanders

00:12:16.873 --> 00:12:20.313
as to whether or not
Dai is a Dragon Knight.

00:12:20.347 --> 00:12:25.256
Therefore, I went to ascertain
the truth - as a neutral party.

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:26.826
[confident chuckle]

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.565
Hadlar was very
opposed to that.

00:12:29.599 --> 00:12:32.137
Could he have
known all along?

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:33.540
Hadlar [thought]:
These dirty, little...

00:12:33.574 --> 00:12:39.084
Vearn: Mystvearn, what do you
think of the boy's power?

00:12:39.117 --> 00:12:41.989
Mystvearn: I gave Flazzard
the most powerful armor

00:12:42.023 --> 00:12:45.865
in my arsenal to
test Dai's strength.

00:12:45.898 --> 00:12:50.072
The child wields a
terrifying amount of power.

00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:53.647
Vearn: [delighted laughter]

00:12:53.681 --> 00:12:55.918
Oh, to think I could have

00:12:55.952 --> 00:13:00.260
two Dragon Knights
under my command...

00:13:00.293 --> 00:13:02.765
Killvearn: General
Baran must be rewarded

00:13:02.799 --> 00:13:06.238
if he succeeds in
recruiting the boy.

00:13:06.271 --> 00:13:07.340
Vearn: Indeed.

00:13:07.374 --> 00:13:11.616
If he does, he may take
the seat of Dark Commander.

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:12.818
But - King Vearn...

00:13:12.851 --> 00:13:16.091
Vearn: My decision
has been made.

00:13:17.762 --> 00:13:19.732
Hadlar [thought]:
I knew it.

00:13:19.766 --> 00:13:22.838
What I was afraid
of has come to pass.

00:13:23.973 --> 00:13:27.013
Zaboera [thought]: So this
is the reason why Hadlar was

00:13:27.047 --> 00:13:30.353
so desperate to keep
Dai from Baran...

00:13:30.386 --> 00:13:32.223
Vearn: However...

00:13:32.257 --> 00:13:37.200
It appears things will
not go that smoothly.

00:13:47.655 --> 00:13:49.725
I'm taking Dino with me.

00:13:49.759 --> 00:13:51.462
Dai: Don't touch me.

00:13:51.495 --> 00:13:52.463
You're all right.

00:13:52.497 --> 00:13:53.600
Dai!

00:13:53.633 --> 00:13:55.336
Don't you understand, child?

00:13:55.369 --> 00:13:59.477
I'm far stronger than you
could ever hope to be.

00:14:00.113 --> 00:14:02.518
I still... have my...

00:14:02.551 --> 00:14:04.454
My final weapon.

00:14:05.624 --> 00:14:06.993
Dai [thought]:
That's right.

00:14:07.027 --> 00:14:09.331
What Matoriv said...

00:14:09.364 --> 00:14:11.503
A Hero's weapon.

00:14:11.536 --> 00:14:16.211
The only weapon I have left
that might work on you...

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.354
is what lets me face
any powerful enemy.

00:14:23.627 --> 00:14:26.566
And that... is my courage!

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.939
Hadlar [thought]: The
only hope I have now...

00:14:29.972 --> 00:14:33.345
is if Dai can defeat Baran.

00:14:33.378 --> 00:14:34.114
Get up, Dino...

00:14:34.147 --> 00:14:35.984
Dai: Don't call me that!

00:14:36.953 --> 00:14:38.890
My name is Dai.

00:14:38.923 --> 00:14:41.996
It's the name my
Grampa gave to me.

00:14:42.531 --> 00:14:45.336
I fight the Dark Army.

00:14:45.369 --> 00:14:47.106
I'm Dai, the Hero!

00:14:47.541 --> 00:14:48.576
Wow, Dai...

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:49.578
Show him!

00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:54.321
Nabara: Don't...

00:14:54.354 --> 00:14:56.626
He's the legendary
Dragon Knight!

00:14:56.659 --> 00:14:58.062
But he's evil!

00:14:58.095 --> 00:15:01.435
Evil, huh? Don't be so sure.

00:15:01.468 --> 00:15:04.808
If the Dragon Knight
decides to wipe us all out,

00:15:04.842 --> 00:15:07.882
it would be
humanity's own fault.

00:15:07.915 --> 00:15:09.552
B-But, I...

00:15:09.585 --> 00:15:12.290
I see. Very well.

00:15:12.324 --> 00:15:16.298
Then I suppose I shall
call you by your human name.

00:15:16.331 --> 00:15:17.601
So, Dai,

00:15:17.634 --> 00:15:21.208
I shall defeat you as a Hero
who fights for the humans.

00:15:21.241 --> 00:15:23.847
If you will not
submit yourself to me,

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.184
this will be your end.

00:15:29.759 --> 00:15:31.729
Leona: Popp,
here's a Fullheal!

00:15:31.762 --> 00:15:32.865
Popp: Thanks.

00:15:32.898 --> 00:15:36.338
But even with my stamina
back, I'm useless.

00:15:36.371 --> 00:15:37.407
Our spells...

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.312
They don't seem to have
any effect on him at all.

00:15:41.014 --> 00:15:43.319
Dai, I hope you have a plan!

00:15:43.353 --> 00:15:46.860
Dai [thought]: If my attack is
too weak, then I'm done for...

00:15:46.893 --> 00:15:48.797
I'll have to finish
him with the biggest,

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:51.870
strongest one I've got.

00:15:51.903 --> 00:15:53.974
I see. I thought you
were hiding something,

00:15:54.007 --> 00:15:56.445
but it seems I was mistaken.

00:15:56.478 --> 00:15:58.082
"Avan Strash," was it?

00:15:58.116 --> 00:16:01.088
I assume that to perform
that particular attack,

00:16:01.121 --> 00:16:02.958
you unite the power, speed,

00:16:02.991 --> 00:16:06.398
and Aura control of
all your sword skills.

00:16:06.431 --> 00:16:09.071
Interesting.

00:16:09.104 --> 00:16:12.443
Baran: That requires strength,
technique, and spirit.

00:16:12.476 --> 00:16:16.252
For a human attack, I must
say it is truly formidable.

00:16:16.285 --> 00:16:19.558
But I trust you've already
seen it won't work on me.

00:16:19.592 --> 00:16:22.497
Dai [thought]: He analyzed
Master Avan's greatest attack

00:16:22.531 --> 00:16:24.902
with just one hit.

00:16:24.935 --> 00:16:27.206
Then there's no other choice.

00:16:27.239 --> 00:16:33.620
Power of Dragons that lies
within me, please... Awaken!

00:16:33.653 --> 00:16:38.295
If I don't defeat him,
he'll wipe out all of humanity!

00:16:40.601 --> 00:16:44.107
[roaring]

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.446
Look - Dai's crest is glowing!

00:16:48.482 --> 00:16:49.618
Could it be?

00:16:50.888 --> 00:16:52.323
Zapple!

00:16:56.766 --> 00:17:00.105
Zap Strash!

00:17:04.081 --> 00:17:05.416
How can he block it?

00:17:05.449 --> 00:17:08.255
I thought Dai's
Strash was perfected?!

00:17:08.289 --> 00:17:11.829
Leona: He's absorbing the
Zapple's energy with his sword.

00:17:12.565 --> 00:17:13.800
No way!

00:17:13.833 --> 00:17:15.269
Baran: I'm impressed you can

00:17:15.303 --> 00:17:18.308
control the Power
of Dragons so well.

00:17:18.342 --> 00:17:20.379
Normally, a Dragon
Knight cannot wield

00:17:20.412 --> 00:17:24.187
the power of the Crest
until they're full grown.

00:17:24.221 --> 00:17:28.663
You've been blessed with good
teachers and good battles.

00:17:30.333 --> 00:17:34.074
For that spirit and courage,

00:17:34.107 --> 00:17:36.779
I shall show you
just how terrifying it is

00:17:36.812 --> 00:17:40.754
when a true Dragon Knight
controls the heavens!

00:17:40.787 --> 00:17:42.089
Kazap!

00:17:51.977 --> 00:17:54.180
[roaring]

00:17:54.716 --> 00:17:56.484
Gigabreak!

00:18:08.042 --> 00:18:09.277
No, Dai!

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:12.216
You're going to regret
doing that, you monster...

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.487
Maybe it won't do
much damage, but...

00:18:14.521 --> 00:18:15.456
Crocodine: Stop!

00:18:15.991 --> 00:18:18.328
I shall face that man.

00:18:19.197 --> 00:18:21.235
Beast King Crocodine
- it's you!

00:18:21.268 --> 00:18:24.074
What a relief.
We're in big trouble!

00:18:24.107 --> 00:18:26.344
Leona [thought]: So,
this is the Beast King.

00:18:26.378 --> 00:18:28.850
With you here it's
like having an army-

00:18:30.921 --> 00:18:32.023
Buddy...

00:18:32.056 --> 00:18:33.526
You're shaking.

00:18:34.628 --> 00:18:35.731
Baran: Crocodine.

00:18:35.764 --> 00:18:38.469
I trust you are fully
aware of what will happen

00:18:38.503 --> 00:18:41.910
if you try to stand
against me here today.

00:18:41.943 --> 00:18:44.414
This might... be my end.

00:18:44.447 --> 00:18:47.187
But, that's something
I'm prepared to do.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.322
But, then...

00:18:48.356 --> 00:18:50.760
Hurry and save our friend.

00:18:50.794 --> 00:18:51.929
Popp: I'll fight with you.

00:18:51.962 --> 00:18:52.998
Leona: Me too!

00:18:53.031 --> 00:18:53.934
Don't bother.

00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:54.869
Both: Huh?!

00:18:54.902 --> 00:18:56.438
Crocodine: I don't know how,

00:18:56.472 --> 00:19:00.446
but he's completely
immune to spells.

00:19:00.479 --> 00:19:02.417
I think the only
way to damage him

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:05.824
is if I attack directly
by hand or with a weapon.

00:19:05.857 --> 00:19:07.327
I see you've figured it out.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.264
Well done, Beast King.

00:19:09.298 --> 00:19:10.600
Crocodine: Get Dai.

00:19:11.001 --> 00:19:12.504
We're on it.

00:19:17.848 --> 00:19:19.852
Baran: You heard everything?

00:19:19.885 --> 00:19:21.021
I heard enough.

00:19:21.055 --> 00:19:22.825
Then why stand in my way?

00:19:22.858 --> 00:19:26.498
Why should I not be
able reclaim my own son?

00:19:26.532 --> 00:19:28.836
Because Dai doesn't want it.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:30.273
Oh, I see.

00:19:30.306 --> 00:19:33.813
So you've completely sided
with the humans, have you?

00:19:33.847 --> 00:19:35.015
Isn't that a shame.

00:19:35.049 --> 00:19:39.324
Of all the Legion Commanders,
I respected you the most.

00:19:39.358 --> 00:19:42.096
That boy, Hyunckel,
wasn't bad either.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:45.436
With his hate for humans
in that heart of ice.

00:19:47.607 --> 00:19:51.515
But everyone I favor seems
to leave the Dark Army.

00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:54.789
I guess Hadlar just
lacks charisma.

00:19:54.822 --> 00:19:56.425
Crocodine: That's not true.

00:19:56.458 --> 00:19:58.462
I don't know about Hyunckel,

00:19:58.495 --> 00:20:01.702
but I was willing to lay
down my life for Lord Hadlar.

00:20:01.736 --> 00:20:03.940
And the same for
the Dark King Vearn.

00:20:03.973 --> 00:20:07.748
A true warrior denies
himself... for his master.

00:20:07.782 --> 00:20:11.488
All that's changed is
that now I support Dai.

00:20:11.522 --> 00:20:14.127
And so you would
actually risk fighting me?

00:20:14.161 --> 00:20:16.298
To protect that boy?

00:20:16.331 --> 00:20:18.001
Crocodine: Without Dai,

00:20:18.035 --> 00:20:22.811
both Hyunckel and I would have
wandered the dark path forever.

00:20:22.844 --> 00:20:28.055
He is the sun that brought light
into our hearts of darkness.

00:20:28.089 --> 00:20:29.390
Baran [thought]: The sun?

00:20:29.424 --> 00:20:33.900
Crocodine: All living things
need the sun to survive.

00:20:33.933 --> 00:20:36.104
No one can be allowed...

00:20:36.138 --> 00:20:37.908
to take it away from them.

00:20:37.942 --> 00:20:41.549
I may not be strong enough,
but I'll still fight!

00:20:41.583 --> 00:20:47.126
Baran: To change the heart of
a warrior such as Crocodine...

00:20:47.159 --> 00:20:50.133
Quite the child.

00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:54.875
The sun...
A child of the sun.

00:20:55.977 --> 00:20:57.781
Soala.

00:20:59.317 --> 00:21:01.856
Why sheath your sword?

00:21:01.889 --> 00:21:05.363
Baran: Crocodine, I see
I won't change your mind.

00:21:05.396 --> 00:21:07.066
But if you do fight me,

00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:11.274
you will learn the terror of
facing a true Dragon Knight...

00:21:11.307 --> 00:21:13.145
The complete
Power of Dragons...

00:21:13.179 --> 00:21:16.519
is far beyond what
you've seen Dai do!

00:21:19.792 --> 00:21:21.395
Crocodine [thought]:
What is this?

00:21:21.428 --> 00:21:25.469
His Aura is staggering,
but he's just standing there!

00:21:25.504 --> 00:21:29.244
What's wrong?
Come and strike me.

00:21:29.277 --> 00:21:33.051
If you won't fight,
then I'll claim your head!

00:21:40.399 --> 00:21:42.237
Crocodine: It...
It can't be.

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.440
My axe cannot be shattered!

00:21:45.309 --> 00:21:46.478
Crocodine: What's this?!

00:21:46.512 --> 00:21:49.451
The secret to the Dragon
Knights' supremacy.

00:21:49.484 --> 00:21:51.487
The Draconic Aura!

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:00.339
Crocodine!

00:23:37.634 --> 00:23:40.205
Narrator: Despite Baran's
shocking revelation,

00:23:40.239 --> 00:23:44.313
Dai pushes aside his doubts and
fights with all of his strength.

00:23:44.346 --> 00:23:45.917
But even with
Crocodine's help,

00:23:45.951 --> 00:23:49.925
he fails to so much as scratch
the mighty Dragon Knight.

00:23:49.958 --> 00:23:52.831
And when Baran's
crest shines ominously,

00:23:52.864 --> 00:23:56.772
Dai finds himself in more
danger than ever before...

00:23:56.806 --> 00:23:58.510
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:58.543 --> 00:24:01.147
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:03.653
"The Terrifying Draconic Aura".
