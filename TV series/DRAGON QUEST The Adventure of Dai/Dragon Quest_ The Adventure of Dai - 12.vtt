WEBVTT

00:01:56.734 --> 00:01:57.569
Maam: I...

00:01:57.602 --> 00:01:58.203
[alarmed breath]

00:01:58.236 --> 00:02:00.407
W-What is this?!

00:02:02.612 --> 00:02:03.781
Let me go!

00:02:03.815 --> 00:02:06.152
-Maam: I said, let me go!
-Moruge: Now, now, young lady.

00:02:06.186 --> 00:02:09.626
I wouldn't struggle
if I were you.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.499
Moruge: This is the Undead
Legion's Underground Palace...

00:02:14.803 --> 00:02:18.176
The entrance is further down
in this extinct volcano.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.748
One wrong move
and into the abyss!

00:02:22.451 --> 00:02:25.792
We've imprisoned
the girl as requested.

00:02:25.826 --> 00:02:26.861
Hyunckel: Good work.

00:02:26.894 --> 00:02:28.430
Also, there's some news.

00:02:28.463 --> 00:02:31.302
A message just
arrived from a Heyedra.

00:02:31.336 --> 00:02:35.244
It seems Hadlar, the Dark
Commander, will be here shortly.

00:02:35.277 --> 00:02:36.780
Hadlar, huh?

00:02:40.522 --> 00:02:41.757
Baduck: My name is Baduck.

00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:44.730
I'm one of
Princess Leona's swordsmen.

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:46.066
Leona?!

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.403
Well, I'm just a
wandering soldier for now.

00:02:48.437 --> 00:02:50.641
Tell me - is the
Princess safe?

00:02:50.674 --> 00:02:52.177
Why, of course!

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.282
She told everyone,
don't you know;

00:02:54.315 --> 00:02:57.120
"We'll be sure to win
once Dai arrives.

00:02:57.154 --> 00:02:59.491
Just hold out until then!"

00:02:59.526 --> 00:03:00.594
Huh?

00:03:01.663 --> 00:03:04.969
So, uh... do you happen
to know where she is now?

00:03:06.472 --> 00:03:08.877
Unfortunately, I do not.

00:03:08.911 --> 00:03:10.581
I was separated
from everybody

00:03:10.615 --> 00:03:13.621
when the Undead Legion
destroyed the temple.

00:03:13.654 --> 00:03:14.923
I understand.

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:16.527
Don't fret.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.831
The three most
powerful Sages in Papnica

00:03:18.864 --> 00:03:20.869
are always by her side.

00:03:20.902 --> 00:03:24.408
I'm sure they're all
still out there somewhere.

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.116
Dai: We got split up
from Gomechan,

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:32.224
so I guess it's
just us now, Popp.

00:03:32.257 --> 00:03:33.728
Popp: Something tells
me that old man's

00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:35.463
going to be disappointed
when he hears

00:03:35.497 --> 00:03:37.434
Hyunckel kicked our butts.

00:03:38.671 --> 00:03:39.305
Hey, uh...

00:03:39.338 --> 00:03:40.541
Tell me, why didn't you use

00:03:40.575 --> 00:03:42.712
the power of
your mark back there?

00:03:44.282 --> 00:03:46.553
Well, listening
to Hyunckel's story,

00:03:46.587 --> 00:03:49.358
I understood how he felt.

00:03:49.793 --> 00:03:51.229
Understood?

00:03:51.262 --> 00:03:54.034
I was raised by
monsters, as well.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:58.912
And... if somebody ever took
Grampa Brass away from me,

00:03:58.945 --> 00:04:01.148
I'd probably hate them.

00:04:01.182 --> 00:04:03.854
I couldn't get mad when
I thought about that.

00:04:04.656 --> 00:04:05.491
You doofus!

00:04:05.525 --> 00:04:07.027
Popp: If we don't beat him,

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.833
we can't save Maam
or the Princess!

00:04:09.866 --> 00:04:11.001
Right...

00:04:11.035 --> 00:04:14.141
We fight him! One more time
- and we do it together.

00:04:14.174 --> 00:04:15.612
No holding back!

00:04:15.645 --> 00:04:19.451
Hadlar: The Underground Palace.
It's been fifteen years.

00:04:19.485 --> 00:04:23.627
So, this place used to
be your home castle, did it?

00:04:23.661 --> 00:04:24.596
Yes.

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:27.301
Hyunckel: Well, well,
the Dark Commander.

00:04:27.334 --> 00:04:29.539
I see that you're
doing quite well.

00:04:31.175 --> 00:04:34.415
So, to what do I owe
this surprise visit?

00:04:34.448 --> 00:04:37.288
Call it a routine
inspection.

00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:39.458
I understand
that the Dark King

00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:42.497
has ordered you
to get rid of the boy,

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:44.536
but I had concerns.

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:47.575
Your concerns
are quite unnecessary.

00:04:47.608 --> 00:04:49.579
I've already fought him once.

00:04:49.613 --> 00:04:52.084
He was really
nothing special.

00:04:52.117 --> 00:04:54.756
Next time,
I'll finish the job.

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.363
An obvious result
with strength such as yours.

00:04:58.396 --> 00:05:00.300
However, you are human,

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:03.440
and also a former
student of Avan.

00:05:03.473 --> 00:05:06.714
Flazzard has voiced
his doubts about you.

00:05:06.747 --> 00:05:09.819
He's under the impression
that you might fail.

00:05:10.821 --> 00:05:11.756
Oh, I'll show him.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.228
Just let the
silly general complain.

00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:15.865
The what - how dare you!

00:05:15.898 --> 00:05:17.101
Listen here!

00:05:17.134 --> 00:05:20.708
My orders come directly from
the Dark King Vearn, himself.

00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:24.949
No one, monster or not, may
question the Dark King's rule!

00:05:27.588 --> 00:05:31.529
Indeed. Just one
more thing, then.

00:05:32.532 --> 00:05:35.571
Has Crocodine passed
through recently?

00:05:35.604 --> 00:05:39.513
He left the Resurrection Fluid
before he was fully healed.

00:05:39.546 --> 00:05:40.849
Hadlar: I thought he may have

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:43.988
taken it upon himself
to pursue the boy.

00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:45.357
Haven't seen him.

00:05:45.391 --> 00:05:47.862
Too bad. That's all.

00:05:47.895 --> 00:05:51.402
You could stay and look around
for a while if you want.

00:05:51.436 --> 00:05:55.644
Revel in the memories of
the empire's rise and fall.

00:05:56.814 --> 00:05:58.584
Hyunckel [thought]:
"Dark Commander."

00:05:58.617 --> 00:06:00.622
If only you'd been
strong enough,

00:06:00.655 --> 00:06:03.527
my father
would still be here.

00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:08.737
Just wait and I'll show you
how weak you really are.

00:06:10.206 --> 00:06:12.946
Why, that insolent
little brat!

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:14.381
Unbelievable.

00:06:14.415 --> 00:06:17.755
What does our Dark King
even see in him anyway?

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:21.663
Hadlar: Perhaps he picked him
on a whim, but I doubt it.

00:06:23.834 --> 00:06:25.571
It was back
when Dark King Vearn

00:06:25.604 --> 00:06:28.510
first chose the
Six Legion Commanders.

00:06:28.543 --> 00:06:29.879
My Dark King,

00:06:29.912 --> 00:06:34.354
I cannot agree with making
Hyunckel a Legion Commander.

00:06:34.388 --> 00:06:38.296
He is human. And a student
of Avan, no less!

00:06:38.329 --> 00:06:39.633
Vearn: I'm aware,

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:43.306
but he only learned from
Avan in order to destroy him.

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:45.878
Quite audacious,
wouldn't you say?

00:06:45.912 --> 00:06:48.884
Furthermore, should
something happen to my power,

00:06:48.917 --> 00:06:51.690
the Undead Legion
would suffer.

00:06:51.723 --> 00:06:53.894
A living human
is the best candidate

00:06:53.927 --> 00:06:56.834
to comfortably
control those forces.

00:06:56.867 --> 00:07:00.675
Your majesty, why do
you favor him so much?

00:07:00.708 --> 00:07:02.043
Vearn: It's his eyes.

00:07:02.077 --> 00:07:03.112
Huh?

00:07:03.146 --> 00:07:05.417
Vearn: His eyes
are magnificent.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.689
They curse everything
they behold and

00:07:07.722 --> 00:07:10.995
smolder with such
beautiful rage.

00:07:11.028 --> 00:07:12.566
They are what I seek.

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:17.040
Truly the eyes of
an Underworld warrior.

00:07:17.073 --> 00:07:20.480
[evil chuckle]

00:07:20.514 --> 00:07:22.752
The Dark King may be great,

00:07:22.785 --> 00:07:25.758
but his motives
are unfathomable.

00:07:25.792 --> 00:07:30.634
Regardless, if Hyunckel
defeats Dai, then so be it.

00:07:30.668 --> 00:07:31.970
On the other hand...

00:07:32.003 --> 00:07:35.778
If he fails, then he's
given us reason to punish him.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:37.715
Dai: [yawn]

00:07:37.748 --> 00:07:40.087
Baduck: Ah, good morning, Dai!

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.923
Oh, yeah. Good morning.

00:07:43.059 --> 00:07:44.494
I found you something.

00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:46.332
This is my old Chain Mail.

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:49.037
I thought it
might come in handy.

00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:50.574
Thank you.

00:07:50.608 --> 00:07:53.212
Say, uh, have you
seen Popp anywhere?

00:07:54.147 --> 00:07:56.085
He was in the forest earlier.

00:07:56.118 --> 00:07:59.491
Dai: That's strange.
He never wakes up before me.

00:08:00.694 --> 00:08:01.930
[startled grunts]

00:08:16.292 --> 00:08:17.327
Dai: Popp!

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.597
What's going on?

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:20.702
What's it look like, rookie?

00:08:20.735 --> 00:08:23.440
Popp: I just bound
with a brand-new spell.

00:08:23.473 --> 00:08:25.077
A new spell?

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.780
We can't beat him by sword,

00:08:26.814 --> 00:08:29.351
so we'll have to
beat him with magic.

00:08:29.385 --> 00:08:30.855
Have you forgotten?

00:08:30.888 --> 00:08:33.894
He said that his
armor repels all magic.

00:08:33.928 --> 00:08:36.466
Dai, you know the
Weather-type spell,

00:08:36.499 --> 00:08:37.869
Climatise, right?

00:08:37.902 --> 00:08:38.604
Maybe...

00:08:38.637 --> 00:08:40.240
Uh... Wait, what is it?

00:08:40.273 --> 00:08:41.510
Never mind.

00:08:41.543 --> 00:08:44.081
I just bound with
something called Reclimatise.

00:08:44.114 --> 00:08:46.719
It allows you to
summon lightning clouds.

00:08:46.753 --> 00:08:49.759
It's one of the most basic
spells for controlling weather,

00:08:49.793 --> 00:08:51.261
but it's a good one.

00:08:54.235 --> 00:08:57.040
Well, I've been up all
night thinking about it.

00:08:57.074 --> 00:09:00.982
There's gotta be some way to use
the weather against Hyunckel...

00:09:01.015 --> 00:09:03.386
Popp: And then I
found just the thing!

00:09:03.419 --> 00:09:07.160
It's an attack spell that's
guaranteed to do some damage.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:09.967
It's called Zapple.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.135
Zapple?

00:09:11.168 --> 00:09:12.337
Popp: Yeah!

00:09:12.371 --> 00:09:15.878
So, the way I'm seeing it,
his armor can repel all magic,

00:09:15.911 --> 00:09:19.118
but it still has to be
made out of metal, right?

00:09:19.151 --> 00:09:21.857
That means, the shock from
an Electric-type spell

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.862
should be able to penetrate it
and damage him directly.

00:09:24.896 --> 00:09:27.000
Y'see what I'm saying?
It's simple!

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:31.376
But, wait. Zapple is a
spell only a Hero can use.

00:09:31.409 --> 00:09:33.914
You can't cast it, and I...

00:09:33.947 --> 00:09:36.485
That's why we're going
to do it together!

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.755
Huh?

00:09:37.788 --> 00:09:39.257
Popp: Zapple needs clouds
in the sky before it can

00:09:39.291 --> 00:09:41.663
strike enemies
with lightning.

00:09:41.697 --> 00:09:45.436
But if I can get the clouds
here with my new spell,

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:50.179
even your Magic Power should be
enough to drop a lightning bolt!

00:09:50.213 --> 00:09:50.715
Oh.

00:09:50.748 --> 00:09:52.283
That's brilliant!

00:09:52.317 --> 00:09:55.758
So, you and I combine
our spells, defeat Hyunckel,

00:09:55.791 --> 00:09:57.695
and then we rescue Maam!

00:09:58.396 --> 00:10:01.068
Got it! Let's try this out!

00:10:05.343 --> 00:10:08.450
Oh, Mighty spirits,
scattered across the heavens...

00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:11.054
I need you to hear my voice!

00:10:14.061 --> 00:10:16.131
Popp: Reclimatise!

00:10:20.841 --> 00:10:22.110
Popp [thought]:
Oh, boy...

00:10:22.144 --> 00:10:25.316
Maybe this spell was a
little too advanced for me.

00:10:33.132 --> 00:10:35.103
Dai, do it! Now!

00:10:35.137 --> 00:10:37.407
[roaring]

00:10:38.877 --> 00:10:40.413
Zapple!

00:10:42.786 --> 00:10:44.522
It worked! I did it!

00:10:44.555 --> 00:10:46.192
Popp: You dummy...

00:10:46.225 --> 00:10:47.728
Look closer.

00:10:49.031 --> 00:10:52.839
Popp: You've already got the
clouds, so of course it worked!

00:10:52.872 --> 00:10:56.011
What's the point if you
can't hit it?! Try again.

00:11:04.562 --> 00:11:05.764
Hyunckel: Open it.

00:11:06.231 --> 00:11:07.166
[alarmed grunt]

00:11:10.841 --> 00:11:12.477
You don't have to worry.

00:11:12.511 --> 00:11:15.416
You're... the bait
to lure in Dai.

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.487
Once I'm done, you can go.

00:11:17.522 --> 00:11:19.491
Maam: Huh? You
don't mean that.

00:11:19.526 --> 00:11:22.030
I won't hurt a girl,
no matter what.

00:11:22.063 --> 00:11:24.735
It's against the
code of a warrior.

00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:27.608
My father taught
me better than that.

00:11:27.642 --> 00:11:30.681
He would always
do battle honorably.

00:11:30.715 --> 00:11:33.218
I still believe that now.

00:11:34.956 --> 00:11:37.561
You really respected him...

00:11:37.595 --> 00:11:38.997
Hyunckel: Of course.

00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:40.835
Makes sense.

00:11:40.868 --> 00:11:43.273
And that's why you
still hate Master Avan

00:11:43.306 --> 00:11:44.609
so much for what he did.

00:11:44.642 --> 00:11:46.045
Yes, exactly!

00:11:46.078 --> 00:11:49.051
How could I ever
forgive Avan for that?

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:53.125
Taking him from me in the
name of justice, and peace?!

00:11:55.998 --> 00:11:59.438
Hyunckel, I'm so sorry.

00:11:59.471 --> 00:12:00.608
You poor soul.

00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:02.745
The pain of losing your
father was so great,

00:12:02.779 --> 00:12:05.216
you had to blame someone.

00:12:05.249 --> 00:12:08.289
But that doesn't mean you
should reject justice!

00:12:08.322 --> 00:12:11.730
That wouldn't make
your father happy.

00:12:11.763 --> 00:12:13.534
He might've been
in the Dark Army,

00:12:13.567 --> 00:12:18.275
but he was still a good
and honorable man, wasn't he?

00:12:19.311 --> 00:12:20.614
Be quiet!

00:12:20.648 --> 00:12:22.852
Open your eyes. Hyunckel.

00:12:22.885 --> 00:12:25.223
I know you're a
better man than this!

00:12:25.256 --> 00:12:26.927
Maam: You're not
some coward who would

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.832
take out their anger
on others out of sorrow!

00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:35.409
Hyunckel: Silence!

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.459
Hyunckel...

00:12:47.334 --> 00:12:49.037
Dai: Zapple!

00:12:52.277 --> 00:12:53.781
Baduck [thought]:
Those kids have been

00:12:53.814 --> 00:12:55.550
going at it for half a day!

00:12:57.454 --> 00:12:59.391
Dai, a little more!

00:13:01.028 --> 00:13:02.965
Zapple!

00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:08.208
That's good! You're
starting to hit it now!

00:13:09.645 --> 00:13:12.017
Hyunckel: How could I
have done something like that?

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:16.358
It's infuriating,
but when I look into her eyes,

00:13:16.392 --> 00:13:18.462
she is speaking the truth.

00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:22.471
[devious chuckle]

00:13:22.505 --> 00:13:24.041
You're still here, old man?

00:13:24.074 --> 00:13:27.515
You seem to be
quite taken by that girl.

00:13:27.548 --> 00:13:31.923
With one spell, I could make
her fall in love with you.

00:13:31.957 --> 00:13:35.263
Zaboera: You may be strong,
but you lack experience in-

00:13:35.296 --> 00:13:36.399
[startled yelp]

00:13:36.432 --> 00:13:37.601
Easy...

00:13:37.635 --> 00:13:38.737
Parasite.

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:41.510
You bring shame to
the Legion Commanders.

00:13:41.543 --> 00:13:42.611
Now, begone!

00:13:43.647 --> 00:13:45.718
[groaning]

00:13:45.751 --> 00:13:49.224
You are going to
regret that! Mark my words.

00:13:49.258 --> 00:13:53.399
Crocodine lost only because he
didn't heed my advice, either!

00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:54.636
Hyunckel: Wrong.

00:13:54.669 --> 00:13:58.342
I bet he lost because you put
poisonous ideas in his head!

00:13:58.844 --> 00:14:00.981
I hate you!

00:14:01.015 --> 00:14:03.486
Hyunckel [thought]: I no
longer have ears for anyone.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.895
From this point forth,
I will fight as I see fit!

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:13.072
Zapple!

00:14:17.614 --> 00:14:19.853
Yes, good. Now one more time!

00:14:19.886 --> 00:14:21.421
Dai: Zapple!

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.049
Okay, that's it!

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:37.555
Now we can go
and rescue Maam!

00:14:37.588 --> 00:14:38.623
Yeah!

00:14:41.094 --> 00:14:43.365
Baduck: Hey!
Come on, you two.

00:14:57.595 --> 00:15:01.068
Baduck: That's the entrance to
the base of the Undead Legion.

00:15:01.102 --> 00:15:02.772
Dai: So Maam's down there?

00:15:02.805 --> 00:15:04.475
Popp: It seems like it.

00:15:04.509 --> 00:15:06.646
She wasn't at the temple...

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.752
So they probably
took her with them.

00:15:09.785 --> 00:15:11.789
Then, Crocodine...

00:15:11.823 --> 00:15:14.093
I don't know
what happened to him.

00:15:14.127 --> 00:15:16.331
It looked like
he was still healing

00:15:16.365 --> 00:15:18.970
from when he fought
against you, Dai.

00:15:19.705 --> 00:15:20.774
That's strange.

00:15:20.807 --> 00:15:22.778
The usual guards
don't seem to be around.

00:15:22.812 --> 00:15:23.813
[chuckle]

00:15:23.847 --> 00:15:26.953
Well how lucky
for us, then. Okay.

00:15:27.755 --> 00:15:28.990
Let's go.

00:15:29.725 --> 00:15:30.694
Baduck: Onward!

00:15:30.728 --> 00:15:31.462
Huh?

00:15:31.495 --> 00:15:32.430
With my mighty sword...

00:15:32.463 --> 00:15:34.803
Popp: Wait, you don't
have to, old timer!

00:15:34.836 --> 00:15:36.138
Did you say "old timer?"

00:15:36.172 --> 00:15:38.475
They called me the greatest
swordsman in Papnica!

00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:42.552
But, uh, we need you here
to keep watch just in case!

00:15:42.585 --> 00:15:45.691
You have a point, I suppose.

00:15:45.724 --> 00:15:46.827
Dai: We're off, then.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.697
Baduck: Take good care!

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:49.899
It's for the best.

00:15:49.932 --> 00:15:51.301
No offense,

00:15:51.335 --> 00:15:54.407
but that old man couldn't
do anything against Hyunckel.

00:15:56.111 --> 00:15:57.748
And same with us.

00:15:57.781 --> 00:15:59.953
Zapple won't work underground.

00:15:59.986 --> 00:16:03.058
So once we find Maam,
we run, and fast.

00:16:03.091 --> 00:16:03.927
You got that?

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.098
Hyunckel will come after us.

00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:08.904
Listen, I've been
mulling it over.

00:16:08.937 --> 00:16:11.375
Hyunckel's the one
in the wrong here.

00:16:11.408 --> 00:16:14.447
I mean, I get that he
has his reasons,

00:16:14.481 --> 00:16:18.088
but that's no excuse for
destroying Papnica Kingdom.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:20.025
I know...

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.230
To be honest...

00:16:22.264 --> 00:16:25.504
when I fought him, I was
completely terrified.

00:16:25.537 --> 00:16:29.277
I thought about running away
like I would have in the past.

00:16:30.413 --> 00:16:33.886
Popp: But thinking about
justice, and Maam, and you...

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.395
well, it made me feel like
I had to try, no matter what.

00:16:38.429 --> 00:16:41.969
And when that happened,
I felt a little less scared.

00:16:42.003 --> 00:16:44.876
O-oh, so now I
come after Maam?

00:16:44.909 --> 00:16:47.347
Come on! I'm being serious.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.219
If we can get Hyunckel
to chase us outside,

00:16:50.253 --> 00:16:51.756
that's when we fight him.

00:16:51.789 --> 00:16:53.760
It'll work - just trust me.

00:16:59.905 --> 00:17:00.974
What's going on?

00:17:01.008 --> 00:17:03.613
omThose brats have
entered the palace!

00:17:03.647 --> 00:17:07.354
Make sure to lead them to where
Master Hyunckel commanded!

00:17:07.387 --> 00:17:08.388
Understood!

00:17:09.357 --> 00:17:11.762
Maam: Oh, no. I've got
to get out of here!

00:17:12.798 --> 00:17:14.400
[chirping]

00:17:14.434 --> 00:17:17.541
G-Gomechan?!
How'd you get there?!

00:17:17.575 --> 00:17:18.643
[explaining chirps]

00:17:18.677 --> 00:17:22.618
Oh, you were worried
about me, so you stowed away?

00:17:22.652 --> 00:17:23.887
[chirping]

00:17:23.921 --> 00:17:26.024
Thank you.

00:17:26.057 --> 00:17:28.496
Maam: Gomechan;
can you get those?

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:29.565
[chirp]

00:17:30.901 --> 00:17:32.971
This place is enormous.

00:17:33.005 --> 00:17:34.708
We're never going
to find the prison.

00:17:34.742 --> 00:17:38.415
So this used to be
Hadlar's Dark Palace, huh?

00:17:38.449 --> 00:17:39.050
[roaring]

00:17:39.083 --> 00:17:40.419
[scared yells]

00:17:40.452 --> 00:17:41.622
Maam: Frizzle!

00:17:44.394 --> 00:17:46.800
Skeleton: The prisoner
has escaped!

00:17:46.833 --> 00:17:48.435
Run for it!

00:17:48.468 --> 00:17:54.147
[fleeing yells]

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.449
Popp, this way!

00:17:55.482 --> 00:17:56.451
Oh, you think?!

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.589
Maam: It's narrow,
but hang in there.

00:17:59.257 --> 00:18:00.994
If this is an air duct,

00:18:01.027 --> 00:18:03.633
then it has to
lead outside somewhere.

00:18:05.737 --> 00:18:07.507
[fleeing yells]

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:10.714
[chuckling]

00:18:12.116 --> 00:18:13.452
Popp: There! An exit!

00:18:15.758 --> 00:18:17.193
What is this place?

00:18:18.763 --> 00:18:21.836
Hyunckel: It's the Colosseum
of the Underground Palace.

00:18:23.172 --> 00:18:25.243
Popp: I told you
this was the wrong way!

00:18:25.276 --> 00:18:26.579
Hyunckel:
The Dark Lord Hadlar

00:18:26.612 --> 00:18:29.384
used to have prisoners
fight monsters here.

00:18:29.417 --> 00:18:33.593
He enjoyed making a
spectacle of the battle.

00:18:33.626 --> 00:18:37.602
I choose it now as the
perfect place to vanquish you!

00:18:37.635 --> 00:18:41.943
Look at that; he's
already fully armored, Dai!

00:18:41.976 --> 00:18:43.880
Dai: We can see
the sky from here.

00:18:43.913 --> 00:18:46.184
It's time to meet your end.

00:18:46.217 --> 00:18:48.022
What have you done with Maam?

00:18:48.055 --> 00:18:49.223
Hyunckel: Don't worry.

00:18:49.257 --> 00:18:52.330
Once you're gone,
I'll have no use for her.

00:18:52.364 --> 00:18:54.500
She'll be safely released.

00:18:54.535 --> 00:18:58.276
In fact, you can leave,
as well, little Mage.

00:18:58.309 --> 00:19:00.113
Thanks but no thanks!

00:19:00.146 --> 00:19:02.684
Well, Popp, we'll
fight here. You ready?

00:19:02.718 --> 00:19:06.358
Yeah! Let's try to hit him
as soon as he raises his sword.

00:19:06.391 --> 00:19:08.429
Hyunckel: I don't
need my sword.

00:19:08.462 --> 00:19:11.201
I'll crush you just like this!

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:33.546
He's toying with us.

00:19:33.579 --> 00:19:36.285
There's no way he's
going to use the sword.

00:19:36.318 --> 00:19:38.288
You summon the clouds, Popp.

00:19:38.321 --> 00:19:40.961
I'll distract him.
That sound good?

00:19:40.994 --> 00:19:42.297
You think it'll work?

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:43.767
It's worth a shot.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.603
Hyunckel: Have you given up?

00:19:46.839 --> 00:19:49.545
[battle cry]

00:19:50.814 --> 00:19:54.588
Hyunckel: Fool! Haven't you
realized you're outmatched?!

00:20:03.438 --> 00:20:06.311
Hyunckel: He's
anticipating my movements?!

00:20:06.344 --> 00:20:09.785
Popp: Nice going, Dai.
Just hold on a little longer!

00:20:13.392 --> 00:20:17.233
Popp: Oh, mighty spirits,
scattered across the heavens...

00:20:17.266 --> 00:20:20.272
I need you to hear my voice!

00:20:26.051 --> 00:20:27.320
Wow...

00:20:27.353 --> 00:20:29.091
A hidden room?

00:20:29.124 --> 00:20:31.394
Maam: Oh! A treasure chest!

00:20:35.169 --> 00:20:36.973
Should we look inside?

00:20:37.006 --> 00:20:37.842
[unsure chirp]

00:20:37.875 --> 00:20:39.846
Well, maybe it's a Cannibox.

00:20:39.879 --> 00:20:41.515
[frightened chirp]

00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:44.822
Or maybe it contains
some powerful,

00:20:44.855 --> 00:20:47.326
legendary weapon, so...

00:20:49.064 --> 00:20:51.034
Maam: This... This is...

00:20:56.546 --> 00:20:57.648
Hyunckel [thought]:
Just one fight

00:20:57.681 --> 00:20:59.484
and he's keeping
up with me?

00:21:01.523 --> 00:21:02.757
Hyunckel: Curse you!

00:21:06.397 --> 00:21:08.068
Hyunckel: What?!
Chain Mail?!

00:21:15.216 --> 00:21:16.586
Hyunckel: Very well.

00:21:16.619 --> 00:21:19.324
If it's a gruesome
death you seek,

00:21:19.357 --> 00:21:23.633
I'll finish you off
with my blade of hell!

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.003
Okay...

00:21:25.036 --> 00:21:26.639
Hyunckel: Time to die!

00:21:26.673 --> 00:21:28.943
Dai: All right...
Popp, now!

00:21:29.344 --> 00:21:31.916
Reclimatise!

00:21:31.949 --> 00:21:32.951
Hyunckel: What?!

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.757
Take this!

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:37.459
Dai: Zapple!

00:21:37.994 --> 00:21:39.463
[pained yell]

00:21:55.296 --> 00:21:56.899
I-it worked!

00:21:56.932 --> 00:22:00.206
[amazed chuckle]

00:22:00.239 --> 00:22:02.043
Popp: We did it! Hooray!

00:22:02.076 --> 00:22:04.413
Popp: [cheering]

00:23:37.834 --> 00:23:40.039
Narrator: When the Zapple
spell fails to stop him,

00:23:40.072 --> 00:23:43.846
the Dark Swordsman strikes back
with an overwhelming fury...

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.721
And soon Dai falls prey
to his Bloody Scryde.

00:23:47.754 --> 00:23:50.026
But just when it seems
like it's all over,

00:23:50.059 --> 00:23:53.767
Maam reveals a shocking truth
about Hyunckel's father,

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:57.540
And our young Hero
rises for another bout!

00:23:57.574 --> 00:23:59.277
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:01.683
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:01.716 --> 00:24:03.686
"The Deciding Moment".
