WEBVTT

00:01:50.856 --> 00:01:52.558
So, you're leaving?

00:01:52.592 --> 00:01:53.694
Dai: Yeah.

00:01:53.727 --> 00:01:54.663
Brass: I'm sorry.

00:01:54.696 --> 00:01:57.334
I really would like
to join you for this...

00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:01.309
Only, if I take even
a step off this island,

00:02:01.343 --> 00:02:03.814
I'll be under the
Dark Lord's control.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.653
Dai: It's fine, Grampa.

00:02:06.687 --> 00:02:09.324
You just wait here and
look after the others.

00:02:09.358 --> 00:02:13.000
I promise you all; I'm going
to defeat the Dark King.

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:14.703
Dai...

00:02:15.772 --> 00:02:16.741
Dai: Where's Gomechan?

00:02:16.774 --> 00:02:19.045
I have... no idea.

00:02:19.078 --> 00:02:20.649
Maybe he's hiding somewhere

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:23.821
because saying goodbye's
just too painful.

00:02:24.856 --> 00:02:26.158
Dai: I see.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.432
And Popp?

00:02:29.465 --> 00:02:30.433
Oh...

00:02:30.467 --> 00:02:33.508
He was crying all night,
so he's still asleep.

00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:36.412
The poor boy had quite
a shock yesterday.

00:02:36.446 --> 00:02:39.720
Hey, Grampa? Will you
take care of him, too?

00:02:39.753 --> 00:02:40.921
Mhmm.

00:02:42.625 --> 00:02:47.367
Popp: Master, don't go!
You can't leave me!

00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:50.307
Avan: Popp, no matter
what you face, remember:

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.213
Use what you've
learned to help others.

00:02:53.247 --> 00:02:55.751
Master! Wait! Don't.

00:02:56.854 --> 00:02:59.058
[yelling]

00:02:59.092 --> 00:03:00.393
No!

00:03:07.141 --> 00:03:08.577
Come back...

00:03:12.151 --> 00:03:14.288
Brass: Romos Kingdom
is the closest.

00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:17.529
Head north, and keep going
straight until you see land.

00:03:17.562 --> 00:03:21.168
Okay. So, that means
first I'll see King Romos.

00:03:21.202 --> 00:03:22.573
Then I'll head to Papnica.

00:03:22.606 --> 00:03:25.343
Watch yourself out there.
You got that?

00:03:32.058 --> 00:03:34.662
Bye, everyone. Take care!

00:03:36.834 --> 00:03:37.735
Wait!

00:03:40.006 --> 00:03:42.277
How dare you!

00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:44.481
What?! You're trying
to leave me here?!

00:03:47.121 --> 00:03:48.322
C'mon!

00:03:53.935 --> 00:03:54.803
Hey!

00:03:54.837 --> 00:03:57.041
Alright, now don't
get the wrong idea.

00:03:57.074 --> 00:04:00.781
I am definitely not about to
go fight the Dark Army, okay?

00:04:00.815 --> 00:04:04.689
I just don't want to spend the
rest of my days on that island.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.125
That's all.

00:04:06.158 --> 00:04:08.697
Just so we're
crystal clear. Got it?

00:04:11.202 --> 00:04:12.705
Seriously?

00:04:14.642 --> 00:04:16.947
Okay. We're off!

00:04:18.116 --> 00:04:19.084
Brass [thought]:
Good luck.

00:04:19.117 --> 00:04:21.455
We'll be thinking
about you both.

00:04:33.681 --> 00:04:35.784
[screaming]

00:04:36.252 --> 00:04:38.323
[roaring]

00:04:38.356 --> 00:04:45.104
-[whimpering]
-[roaring]

00:04:45.137 --> 00:04:47.608
Mina: Somebody, help!

00:05:02.004 --> 00:05:03.740
[roaring]

00:05:13.894 --> 00:05:14.996
[proud chuckle]

00:05:15.463 --> 00:05:17.334
I was so scared!

00:05:17.368 --> 00:05:19.205
Hey... Are you okay?

00:05:19.238 --> 00:05:20.841
I am. Thank you!

00:05:20.874 --> 00:05:21.777
You're alone?

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.579
Mina: Mhmm.

00:05:22.612 --> 00:05:25.518
And I... I can't
find my way home.

00:05:25.551 --> 00:05:26.987
So... you're lost?

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.524
Yes. Oh, please...

00:05:28.558 --> 00:05:31.096
Could you take me
back to my village?

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:33.199
Dai: Well, about that.

00:05:33.233 --> 00:05:34.536
We, uh...

00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:36.574
Mina: Pretty please?

00:05:36.607 --> 00:05:39.779
We're... actually a little
bit lost ourselves.

00:05:41.683 --> 00:05:43.186
[crying]

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.823
This is so pathetic!

00:05:44.856 --> 00:05:48.463
I only followed you because
you said you've got this.

00:05:48.496 --> 00:05:51.135
This place is a lot bigger
than Dermline Island.

00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:53.439
What are we gonna do?

00:05:53.473 --> 00:05:55.477
It's been three whole
days since we got here,

00:05:55.512 --> 00:05:58.416
and we've been totally
lost the entire time!

00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:00.086
[frightened gasp]

00:06:02.024 --> 00:06:04.027
[roaring]

00:06:15.384 --> 00:06:18.089
What kinda weapon is that?

00:06:18.122 --> 00:06:21.196
Maam: Learn to see things
through, little Mage.

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:22.364
Oh yeah?

00:06:22.397 --> 00:06:24.235
If you've got such a
problem with my magic,

00:06:24.268 --> 00:06:26.472
then let's do this,
tough guy.

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:28.944
Oh...

00:06:28.977 --> 00:06:30.547
What was that for?

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.856
You pervert!

00:06:35.725 --> 00:06:36.793
A girl?

00:06:44.108 --> 00:06:45.043
Mina: Maam!

00:06:45.076 --> 00:06:46.379
Mina!

00:06:46.412 --> 00:06:47.849
What a bad girl.

00:06:47.882 --> 00:06:50.053
How many times now
have I told you;

00:06:50.086 --> 00:06:51.523
don't go into the forest alone!

00:06:51.556 --> 00:06:53.226
But... I had to!

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:55.564
Mommy was bitten
by a Poison Slime.

00:06:55.598 --> 00:06:58.069
I was looking for an
Antidotal Herb.

00:06:58.103 --> 00:07:00.641
Well, you should've come
straight to me, Mina.

00:07:00.674 --> 00:07:03.814
Now... Are you sure
that everything's all right?

00:07:03.847 --> 00:07:04.883
Yeah.

00:07:04.916 --> 00:07:07.955
These two saved me from
the monsters just in time.

00:07:08.924 --> 00:07:10.060
[awkward chuckle]

00:07:10.093 --> 00:07:12.865
Thank you so much. I'm Maam.

00:07:14.168 --> 00:07:17.608
We're both from Nayle Village.
It's just east of the forest.

00:07:17.641 --> 00:07:20.180
My name's Dai,
and this is Popp.

00:07:20.213 --> 00:07:22.417
We've been traveling together.

00:07:22.451 --> 00:07:24.288
You're really strong, huh?

00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:26.727
Well, you have to
be if you live nearby.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.933
You can't afford to be weak
living next to the Dark Forest.

00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:31.436
Why's that?

00:07:31.469 --> 00:07:33.841
Maam: Ever since
the Dark Lord returned,

00:07:33.875 --> 00:07:37.181
tons of his monsters have turned
up and started living out here.

00:07:37.214 --> 00:07:40.788
And this place was already like
a maze before they arrived,

00:07:40.822 --> 00:07:43.226
so the people of this
country began calling it

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:45.430
the Dark Forest as a warning.

00:07:45.463 --> 00:07:46.700
That makes sense.

00:07:46.733 --> 00:07:49.305
So, what brings the two
of you out this way?

00:07:49.338 --> 00:07:50.808
They said they're lost.

00:07:50.841 --> 00:07:52.879
We're looking for
Romos Palace.

00:07:52.912 --> 00:07:54.782
Maam: The palace is straight
through the forest.

00:07:54.816 --> 00:07:57.855
You can't miss it...
But listen, the sun's setting.

00:07:57.889 --> 00:08:01.228
So why don't you come and
stay the night in our village?

00:08:01.261 --> 00:08:04.302
I'd like to thank you for
saving little Mina here.

00:08:04.335 --> 00:08:05.336
Really?! That sounds...

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:06.138
[shushing]

00:08:06.172 --> 00:08:07.509
What's wrong, Popp?!

00:08:07.542 --> 00:08:09.211
Popp: Forget that girl.

00:08:09.244 --> 00:08:10.814
Let's just get out of here.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.352
Why? They said we could stay!

00:08:13.386 --> 00:08:14.522
You dummy!

00:08:14.555 --> 00:08:16.358
We can either sleep
in some scrawny village,

00:08:16.392 --> 00:08:17.695
or a big ol' palace.

00:08:17.728 --> 00:08:19.632
C'mon. That's not
even a debate.

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.569
Hey, she might hear.

00:08:22.203 --> 00:08:23.707
She does hear.

00:08:24.876 --> 00:08:28.584
My village is scrawny,
as you've guessed.

00:08:28.617 --> 00:08:30.087
So why don't you hurry along

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.193
and go get your dinner
at the palace now.

00:08:33.226 --> 00:08:34.563
He didn't mean it.

00:08:34.596 --> 00:08:35.898
Well, after dark,

00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:38.504
all kinds of ferocious monsters
start prowling the area,

00:08:38.537 --> 00:08:39.940
looking for their next meal.

00:08:39.973 --> 00:08:43.313
So, you'd better get
through the forest quick.

00:08:43.346 --> 00:08:44.649
But with your skills,

00:08:44.683 --> 00:08:46.820
you'll probably wind up
in something's stomach.

00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:49.526
Okay...

00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:51.930
Sure! The two of us
can handle a few bushes.

00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:54.101
Who needs your dumb
advice, anyways?

00:08:56.673 --> 00:08:59.679
Uh... You guys?

00:09:00.313 --> 00:09:01.650
[startled yelp]

00:09:01.683 --> 00:09:03.086
Popp: C'mon, Dai.
Let's just go.

00:09:03.119 --> 00:09:06.492
Before some more
"scary monsters" show up.

00:09:06.527 --> 00:09:07.862
Maam, are you sure?

00:09:07.895 --> 00:09:10.199
Oh yeah. Forget about them.

00:09:10.568 --> 00:09:11.736
Oh...

00:09:12.938 --> 00:09:15.076
Mina: I think
they forgot this.

00:09:19.451 --> 00:09:20.353
Maam: A Slime?

00:09:20.387 --> 00:09:21.321
[chirping]

00:09:22.423 --> 00:09:23.561
Wow! So pretty.

00:09:23.594 --> 00:09:25.062
Don't touch it, Mina!

00:09:29.004 --> 00:09:31.175
But it's afraid.
Don't be mean.

00:09:32.477 --> 00:09:33.814
I wasn't...

00:09:34.582 --> 00:09:36.853
Mina: It's okay.
Come here.

00:09:39.357 --> 00:09:40.928
Mina: So cute!

00:09:41.696 --> 00:09:42.732
Those guys...

00:09:42.765 --> 00:09:44.434
What are we supposed to do?

00:09:44.467 --> 00:09:46.371
You know we can't
keep it, right?

00:09:47.006 --> 00:09:48.777
Go after them.

00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:51.683
All right. After we
get you home.

00:09:52.619 --> 00:09:54.221
Popp: I'll show her!

00:09:54.254 --> 00:09:56.425
That stupid, stuck up-

00:09:56.458 --> 00:09:58.395
I swear I'll
get us out of here.

00:09:58.964 --> 00:09:59.966
Oh, Popp.

00:09:59.999 --> 00:10:02.037
Dai: We should have taken
her up on her offer.

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.306
Popp: Quiet...

00:10:03.339 --> 00:10:05.812
And hurry up, too.

00:10:05.845 --> 00:10:08.249
Zaboera: A servants
has located the boy, Dai,

00:10:08.283 --> 00:10:09.385
in the Dark Forest.

00:10:09.418 --> 00:10:12.792
Hadlar: I see. He must be
heading for Romos Castle.

00:10:12.825 --> 00:10:16.465
Zaboera: The land of Romos
is Furfang Legion territory.

00:10:16.498 --> 00:10:20.306
Hadlar: Then we must contact
the Legion Commander at once.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.456
Hadlar: Crocodine...

00:10:28.489 --> 00:10:30.827
Beast King Crocodine.

00:10:33.934 --> 00:10:36.306
Who's there? What is it?

00:10:36.339 --> 00:10:38.710
Hadlar: It is I, Hadlar.

00:10:39.278 --> 00:10:41.549
Ah, Dark Commander, sir.

00:10:41.583 --> 00:10:43.286
Forgive my rudeness.

00:10:43.319 --> 00:10:44.556
Why should I?

00:10:44.589 --> 00:10:47.160
I ordered you to take
over Romos Kingdom,

00:10:47.194 --> 00:10:48.329
and you're napping.

00:10:49.465 --> 00:10:51.101
It is a worthless kingdom.

00:10:51.135 --> 00:10:54.810
Nothing but cowards, and not
a worthy warrior among them.

00:10:54.843 --> 00:10:58.015
I only slumber to
stave off my boredom.

00:10:58.049 --> 00:11:01.055
The Furfang Legion
can handle it without me.

00:11:01.088 --> 00:11:04.127
A few more days,
and the region is ours.

00:11:04.796 --> 00:11:06.566
You haven't changed.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.337
But that's not why
I'm calling on you.

00:11:09.371 --> 00:11:13.245
Someone who opposes us
is lost in the Dark Forest,

00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:15.785
and he may be the
challenge you seek.

00:11:15.818 --> 00:11:18.389
Ah... They're strong?

00:11:19.325 --> 00:11:20.293
Hadlar: This is him.

00:11:20.327 --> 00:11:24.067
His name is Dai,
and I want you to destroy him.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.309
[laughing]

00:11:28.342 --> 00:11:29.979
Hadlar: Is something funny?

00:11:30.013 --> 00:11:31.482
Surely you jest, my liege.

00:11:31.516 --> 00:11:35.356
I hold the title of Beast King.
I've never been defeated...

00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:38.564
And you would have me
battle such a puny child?

00:11:38.597 --> 00:11:41.402
He's young, but don't
underestimate him.

00:11:41.435 --> 00:11:45.944
He possesses incredible power,
and I've seen it for myself.

00:11:45.978 --> 00:11:49.117
In fact, he even
managed to best me.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.253
Crocodine: What?

00:11:50.286 --> 00:11:53.225
He must be stopped before
he can grow any stronger,

00:11:53.259 --> 00:11:56.398
or he's sure to become
an even greater threat.

00:11:57.768 --> 00:11:59.038
Interesting.

00:11:59.071 --> 00:12:01.844
If this boy could
hurt someone like you,

00:12:01.877 --> 00:12:04.849
then I'd love to fight him.

00:12:06.686 --> 00:12:10.059
Indeed. I'm counting
on you, Beast King.

00:12:27.528 --> 00:12:28.463
Popp: Great.

00:12:28.496 --> 00:12:29.933
Another dead end.

00:12:29.966 --> 00:12:33.540
Dai: I told you we should've
asked that girl for directions.

00:12:33.573 --> 00:12:37.882
No way! I just can't stand
stuck-up girls like that.

00:12:37.915 --> 00:12:40.554
Dai: So... What kind of
girls do you like?

00:12:41.355 --> 00:12:42.691
Well, let's see.

00:12:42.725 --> 00:12:43.927
Someone...

00:12:43.961 --> 00:12:47.066
Beautiful, smart, too.
Rich would be great...

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.204
And they'll treat me
just like a king.

00:12:49.237 --> 00:12:50.875
[chuckling]

00:12:50.908 --> 00:12:52.611
Dai: Oh, Popp, wow...

00:12:52.645 --> 00:12:54.515
You're a little
selfish, aren't you?

00:12:54.549 --> 00:12:55.517
[roaring]

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:56.620
[alarmed gasps]

00:12:56.653 --> 00:12:58.188
Oh, no. What now?

00:12:58.222 --> 00:13:00.426
It's strong...
Whatever it is.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.366
[roaring]

00:13:03.399 --> 00:13:04.802
That means trouble...

00:13:10.847 --> 00:13:13.987
[battle roar]

00:13:14.689 --> 00:13:16.158
Dai: It's coming!

00:13:27.882 --> 00:13:29.519
There you are, boy.

00:13:29.552 --> 00:13:31.054
Who is this guy?

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:35.564
The name is
Beast King Crocodine,

00:13:35.597 --> 00:13:39.672
Commander of one of the
six legions under Hadlar.

00:13:39.706 --> 00:13:42.243
The mighty Furfang legion.

00:13:42.778 --> 00:13:44.081
The six legions?

00:13:44.114 --> 00:13:45.283
Crocodine: That's right.

00:13:45.316 --> 00:13:48.489
The Dark Army is
divided into six forces-

00:13:48.524 --> 00:13:50.927
each with their
own specialty.

00:13:51.729 --> 00:13:53.199
The Undead Legion:

00:13:53.232 --> 00:13:57.509
Made of warriors who have
overcome even death itself!

00:13:57.542 --> 00:13:59.144
The Blizzblaze Legion:

00:13:59.178 --> 00:14:02.819
Destroyers capable of freezing
or incinerating anything-

00:14:02.852 --> 00:14:05.323
even an enemy's soul.

00:14:05.356 --> 00:14:06.559
The Mystic Legion:

00:14:06.593 --> 00:14:11.268
A league of Mages who
control unparalleled magic.

00:14:11.736 --> 00:14:13.205
The Shadow Legion:

00:14:13.239 --> 00:14:18.349
Hunters who strike from the
shadows, unseen and unknown.

00:14:18.382 --> 00:14:20.119
The Dragon Legion:

00:14:20.152 --> 00:14:24.060
A horde of the most
powerful monsters known.

00:14:25.329 --> 00:14:28.803
And mine: The dreaded
Furfang Legion.

00:14:28.837 --> 00:14:31.943
Crocodine: A pack
of fearless beasts!

00:14:32.578 --> 00:14:34.114
Now, Dai...

00:14:34.147 --> 00:14:37.989
By direct order of Hadlar,
you must perish.

00:14:38.022 --> 00:14:41.461
If you wish to survive,
show me your true strength...

00:14:41.495 --> 00:14:43.867
The strength which
allowed you to wound

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.573
even the Dark
Commander himself.

00:14:46.606 --> 00:14:49.244
Stuff it...
Stupid Crocodile.

00:14:50.213 --> 00:14:51.315
Popp: From what I'm hearing,

00:14:51.348 --> 00:14:53.218
it sounds like
you're not much more than

00:14:53.252 --> 00:14:55.456
another one of
Hadlar's underlings.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:59.497
And even he had to turn tail and
run after trying to fight us.

00:14:59.532 --> 00:15:03.372
An oaf like you will hardly
make us break a sweat.

00:15:03.405 --> 00:15:04.542
Right, Dai?

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:07.949
Dai [thought]: You didn't
do anything last time.

00:15:07.982 --> 00:15:10.019
[chuckling]

00:15:10.052 --> 00:15:11.857
You think that's funny, do 'ya?

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:13.025
Just watch.

00:15:13.058 --> 00:15:15.665
Yeah - 'cause I could
easily wipe you out

00:15:15.698 --> 00:15:16.833
with one of my spells.

00:15:16.866 --> 00:15:18.904
I don't even know who you are.

00:15:18.937 --> 00:15:21.042
But go ahead and try.

00:15:21.075 --> 00:15:23.178
Oh, yeah?! Here comes!

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.049
Frizz!

00:15:31.896 --> 00:15:32.799
[horrified yell]

00:15:32.832 --> 00:15:34.134
With just his breath?

00:15:34.167 --> 00:15:35.771
A spell like that?

00:15:35.804 --> 00:15:38.175
You could barely hurt a Slime.

00:15:38.209 --> 00:15:41.616
My turn, you insolent
little fool.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:44.588
[roaring]

00:15:52.705 --> 00:15:54.575
[trembling]

00:15:54.608 --> 00:15:56.746
Dai [thought]: When it
comes to raw power,

00:15:56.779 --> 00:15:58.716
he's even stronger
than Hadlar!

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.286
[chuckle]

00:16:00.319 --> 00:16:03.192
You shouldn't
underestimate your opponent.

00:16:03.225 --> 00:16:06.131
A Legion Commander can
withstand far worse.

00:16:06.164 --> 00:16:09.404
We all surpass Hadlar when
it comes to our specialties.

00:16:09.437 --> 00:16:12.879
That's exactly why we were
chosen in the first place.

00:16:12.912 --> 00:16:14.080
'Kay, Popp.

00:16:14.114 --> 00:16:17.120
We are not going to beat
him if we fight head-on.

00:16:17.153 --> 00:16:19.592
If you can cast
some distraction,

00:16:19.625 --> 00:16:21.394
I think I can hit him.

00:16:24.636 --> 00:16:25.670
Uh, Popp?

00:16:26.272 --> 00:16:27.140
Hey!

00:16:27.173 --> 00:16:29.512
No way! Thanks a lot...

00:16:29.546 --> 00:16:30.981
[cackling]

00:16:31.014 --> 00:16:33.018
The weakling
knows when to run.

00:16:33.052 --> 00:16:34.689
A very wise choice.

00:16:34.722 --> 00:16:37.794
Crocodine: My orders were
only to vanquish you, Dai.

00:16:37.828 --> 00:16:40.533
So don't worry.
I'll spare him.

00:16:41.368 --> 00:16:42.504
Here goes.

00:16:47.681 --> 00:16:48.482
Sorry, Dai!

00:16:48.517 --> 00:16:50.888
I hope you find
a way out of there.

00:16:50.921 --> 00:16:52.423
[pained grunt]

00:16:53.593 --> 00:16:55.229
Ow-ow. What the...

00:16:57.668 --> 00:16:59.605
Popp: A-An Infanticore?

00:17:00.507 --> 00:17:02.878
[furious roar]

00:17:02.912 --> 00:17:04.414
[fearful blubbering]

00:17:04.447 --> 00:17:06.084
[screaming]

00:17:14.234 --> 00:17:17.073
Dai [thought]: He's a lot
faster than I thought he'd be.

00:17:17.741 --> 00:17:18.910
What's wrong?

00:17:18.943 --> 00:17:22.450
Stop avoiding it.
Give me a fight!

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:25.289
Here it comes, Crocodine.

00:17:26.058 --> 00:17:27.662
What stance is that?

00:17:27.695 --> 00:17:29.498
Avan Style Sword Technique!

00:17:29.532 --> 00:17:30.466
Avan...

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.673
You mean the one
who defeated Hadlar?

00:17:33.707 --> 00:17:35.510
The legendary Hero?

00:17:35.543 --> 00:17:38.115
That's right.
He was my master.

00:17:38.149 --> 00:17:39.417
Crocodine: I see...

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:43.392
Intriguing. So now you
carry on his will, do you?

00:17:43.426 --> 00:17:46.431
You're a Disciple of Avan!

00:17:46.465 --> 00:17:47.668
Yes, I am.

00:17:47.701 --> 00:17:48.670
Come on!

00:17:49.639 --> 00:17:50.640
Earth Slash!

00:17:51.943 --> 00:17:53.178
Dai [thought]:
It didn't work?

00:17:53.211 --> 00:17:56.217
How could Earth Slash
not even leave a scratch?

00:17:58.389 --> 00:18:01.194
Dai [thought]: His hide
is as tough as steel!

00:18:01.227 --> 00:18:02.464
[amused chuckle]

00:18:02.497 --> 00:18:03.533
Not too bad.

00:18:03.567 --> 00:18:07.708
But it'll take more than
a mere knife to hurt me.

00:18:07.741 --> 00:18:09.010
Now hold still,

00:18:09.043 --> 00:18:11.749
and see the might of
a true warrior's weapon.

00:18:16.158 --> 00:18:17.426
It's a Whoosh spell!

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.932
Right. I can't
use magic myself

00:18:19.966 --> 00:18:25.877
but my Vortex Axe is imbued
with wind-type incantations.

00:18:25.911 --> 00:18:28.683
Dai [thought]: That's right.
Master mentioned this once.

00:18:28.717 --> 00:18:31.421
Legendary weapons
enchanted to wield spells

00:18:31.454 --> 00:18:33.660
when they're used as an item.

00:18:33.694 --> 00:18:37.500
Vortex Axe... Howl!

00:18:40.439 --> 00:18:42.110
Gotcha!

00:18:42.143 --> 00:18:43.646
Dai [thought]:
This isn't going to work.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.784
If I can't beat
him with strength...

00:18:45.817 --> 00:18:46.753
Speed!

00:18:46.786 --> 00:18:48.389
Yeah - I'll keep dodging
and see what happens

00:18:48.422 --> 00:18:50.292
when I hit him
with a Wave Slash!

00:18:50.326 --> 00:18:51.327
Crocodine: Now die.

00:18:54.502 --> 00:18:55.704
What?

00:19:02.584 --> 00:19:04.354
Curse you, brat.

00:19:08.931 --> 00:19:11.570
-[roaring]
-[screaming]

00:19:11.603 --> 00:19:12.905
Hold on!

00:19:12.938 --> 00:19:15.410
[screaming]

00:19:15.443 --> 00:19:16.345
Not you!

00:19:16.378 --> 00:19:17.848
Jump to the side.

00:19:17.881 --> 00:19:18.549
What?

00:19:18.583 --> 00:19:19.484
Just jump!

00:19:19.519 --> 00:19:20.553
Oh, right.

00:19:20.987 --> 00:19:22.657
[battle cry]

00:19:29.539 --> 00:19:32.511
Popp [thought]: Whoa...
She's even stronger than me!

00:19:32.911 --> 00:19:34.480
Are you okay?

00:19:34.515 --> 00:19:35.951
Uh... Yes?

00:19:35.984 --> 00:19:37.220
What happened?

00:19:37.253 --> 00:19:40.359
Well, you see, we were
attacked by the Dark Army.

00:19:40.393 --> 00:19:42.865
Popp: I managed
to get away, but...

00:19:42.898 --> 00:19:44.200
Where'd your friend go?

00:19:44.233 --> 00:19:46.606
Uh, yeah...
About that...

00:19:46.639 --> 00:19:49.745
You're telling me you
abandoned him in a fight?!

00:19:51.214 --> 00:19:52.416
Well?!

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.121
Maam: Start talking.

00:19:54.154 --> 00:19:55.724
Uh...

00:19:55.758 --> 00:19:56.692
Huh?

00:19:56.726 --> 00:19:58.763
[snarling]

00:20:11.355 --> 00:20:13.325
That was a Frizz spell!

00:20:13.358 --> 00:20:14.829
Popp [thought]:
With a weapon like that,

00:20:14.862 --> 00:20:18.235
there's no way she's
just some ordinary girl!

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:22.811
[gasp]

00:20:24.381 --> 00:20:26.451
This is...
It can't be...

00:20:26.485 --> 00:20:28.589
An Insignia of Avan!

00:20:29.424 --> 00:20:31.294
Popp: Then, you're also...

00:20:31.896 --> 00:20:32.664
Oh!

00:20:32.697 --> 00:20:33.833
Popp: Oh, I, uh,
didn't mean to...

00:20:33.867 --> 00:20:35.570
[growling]

00:20:45.356 --> 00:20:46.693
Crocodine: Vortex Axe!

00:20:46.726 --> 00:20:49.766
This is it! Avan Style
Sword Technique...

00:20:49.799 --> 00:20:51.434
Wave Slash!

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:57.480
[pained scream]

00:20:59.083 --> 00:21:02.658
Heat Breath.
My secret attack.

00:21:02.691 --> 00:21:06.866
I'm still impressed, Dai.
You managed to wound me.

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:11.408
Why can't I move?

00:21:11.442 --> 00:21:12.844
That's enough, now.

00:21:12.878 --> 00:21:14.915
You have fought very well.

00:21:14.949 --> 00:21:16.452
You were far stronger than

00:21:16.485 --> 00:21:19.591
any of the veteran
warriors I've bested.

00:21:19.625 --> 00:21:21.529
Crocodine: It really
is a shame...

00:21:21.562 --> 00:21:23.766
But I'll make it quick.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:24.735
Dai!

00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:26.404
Back off.

00:21:27.373 --> 00:21:29.310
Crocodine: You won't stop me.

00:21:31.649 --> 00:21:33.085
Dai, get up!

00:21:33.118 --> 00:21:34.621
Popp: Why won't he run?

00:21:37.359 --> 00:21:39.731
I think he must've
been paralyzed!

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:44.407
That's it! Your weapon!

00:21:46.746 --> 00:21:49.351
Popp: Hold on.
Crocodine's our enemy.

00:21:49.384 --> 00:21:50.620
Where are you aiming?

00:21:50.654 --> 00:21:52.022
No, stop!

00:22:00.908 --> 00:22:03.345
Popp: Dai!

00:23:37.601 --> 00:23:39.404
Narrator: While Dai
and Crocodine's battle

00:23:39.437 --> 00:23:40.940
continues in the Dark Forest,

00:23:40.973 --> 00:23:43.846
the action reminds Maam of
her own training with Avan,

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:46.785
and a lesson he left
her with long ago.

00:23:46.819 --> 00:23:49.658
But when Popp and Dai prepare
to head out for another bout,

00:23:49.692 --> 00:23:51.361
Maam will make a
decision that could

00:23:51.394 --> 00:23:53.567
alter the course of her life.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.804
Can she accept her destiny?

00:23:55.837 --> 00:23:57.508
