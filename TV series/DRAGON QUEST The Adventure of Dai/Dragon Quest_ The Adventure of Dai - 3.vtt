WEBVTT

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:03.948
Hadlar: It's time,
my beautiful minions.

00:02:03.982 --> 00:02:07.889
Dark Army... Charge!

00:02:22.418 --> 00:02:24.355
Avan: This is
looking pretty grim.

00:02:24.388 --> 00:02:26.159
You better speed it up, Popp.

00:02:26.192 --> 00:02:27.261
Popp: Yes, Master.

00:02:27.294 --> 00:02:30.568
Woo-hoo. C'mon, gang!

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.607
[vicious snarl]

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.813
[angry roaring]

00:02:38.383 --> 00:02:40.286
What are you doing?

00:02:43.093 --> 00:02:44.261
[chirping]

00:02:44.294 --> 00:02:47.001
Gomechan! Are you okay, buddy?

00:02:47.034 --> 00:02:49.939
[fighting grunts]

00:02:49.973 --> 00:02:52.546
What's going on
with all of you?

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.850
Dai: Grampa, something
weird's happening!

00:02:54.884 --> 00:03:02.430
[struggling grunts]

00:03:02.464 --> 00:03:04.870
Dai: Not you, too...
Snap out of it!

00:03:04.904 --> 00:03:07.976
[struggling grunts]

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.844
Dai?

00:03:08.877 --> 00:03:09.946
What is this?

00:03:11.717 --> 00:03:13.186
Tell me what's wrong.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.323
Brass: It feels
like the old days...

00:03:15.356 --> 00:03:17.628
Rage is coursing
through my veins.

00:03:17.662 --> 00:03:21.002
If I don't stay focused,
I think I might go berserk!

00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:22.137
[struggling grunt]

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.308
It seems like everyone
else already did...

00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:26.378
But what's doing this, Grampa?

00:03:30.154 --> 00:03:32.725
Brass: I fear there's
only one explanation.

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:35.197
Somehow the
Dark Lord's returned.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.600
Huh?!

00:03:36.634 --> 00:03:38.871
Brass: This urge for destruction
feels just like the spell

00:03:38.904 --> 00:03:41.610
Lord Hadlar used to
control us years ago...

00:03:41.644 --> 00:03:43.814
He must be using
his dark powers

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:45.317
to gather us all together.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.020
Then he'll overthrow the world!

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.058
What do we do?

00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:51.062
You need to leave
the island, now.

00:03:51.095 --> 00:03:52.464
If I'm right,

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:54.936
then it's not going to be
safe for you here much longer.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.643
Brass: Now, hurry!

00:03:57.676 --> 00:03:58.644
But...

00:03:58.678 --> 00:04:00.447
When you first washed
up here in this boat,

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.984
the only reason
I could raise you

00:04:02.017 --> 00:04:05.391
was because my heart was
free from that evil spell.

00:04:05.424 --> 00:04:07.862
I'd never forgive
myself if I hurt you.

00:04:07.895 --> 00:04:09.934
Please, Dai.
You have to go.

00:04:09.967 --> 00:04:11.435
I can't just leave you.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.281
[charging grunts]

00:04:17.314 --> 00:04:18.518
Get in the boat.

00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:19.485
No way!

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.689
Don't argue with me.

00:04:20.722 --> 00:04:23.192
I'm not gonna abandon
all of my friends.

00:04:23.226 --> 00:04:25.965
A true Hero would never
do something like that!

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:27.034
Listen...

00:04:27.068 --> 00:04:29.338
Avan: Well put, young man!

00:04:29.372 --> 00:04:32.144
I couldn't have said
it better myself.

00:04:32.177 --> 00:04:33.547
You must be Dai.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.052
Hang on...

00:04:36.085 --> 00:04:37.655
How do you know my name?

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.534
We'll get to that, but first
let me sort out your friends.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.247
[battle cry]

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.983
[charging yell]

00:04:52.017 --> 00:04:52.985
Watch out!

00:04:55.925 --> 00:04:57.027
I wouldn't worry about him-

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.198
Master's an expert
with monsters.

00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:00.466
Master Avan?

00:05:04.308 --> 00:05:06.913
[charging yell]

00:05:18.838 --> 00:05:20.708
I hereby banish you...

00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:21.877
Dark forces!

00:05:25.952 --> 00:05:27.955
Glimmer!

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:35.036
[amazed breath]

00:05:44.857 --> 00:05:46.660
[snarling]

00:05:47.962 --> 00:05:48.797
Incredible...

00:05:48.831 --> 00:05:50.400
A miracle.

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:52.271
Brass: Who are you, stranger?

00:05:52.304 --> 00:05:55.544
Oh, almost forgot.
How rude of me.

00:05:55.577 --> 00:05:57.616
They call me
the tutor, and I...

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:59.586
I travel the world
helping young warriors

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.355
live up to their
full potential.

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:03.059
So you're a Hero trainer.

00:06:03.092 --> 00:06:07.034
Yes! I teach all the
agents of peace and justice.

00:06:07.067 --> 00:06:08.436
Heroes, Sages, Mages...

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.674
No matter what your
raw materials are,

00:06:10.708 --> 00:06:14.115
I can turn them all into
world-class warriors.

00:06:14.148 --> 00:06:18.222
I am Avan De Zinuar the third,
but just call me Avan.

00:06:18.255 --> 00:06:19.391
[curious grunt]

00:06:19.424 --> 00:06:21.495
Now why do I
recognize that name?

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.335
And this is Popp, one of
my brightest students.

00:06:24.368 --> 00:06:25.538
Avan: If he applies himself,

00:06:25.571 --> 00:06:28.276
one day he'll make
a very powerful mage.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.481
So Avan, what brings
a teacher like you

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:32.150
to an island like this?

00:06:32.184 --> 00:06:33.286
Perhaps you've noticed...

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:34.523
The Dark Lord has returned,

00:06:34.556 --> 00:06:37.061
and he's assembling
his forces once again.

00:06:37.094 --> 00:06:38.129
Brass: I knew it!

00:06:38.162 --> 00:06:41.101
Monsters everywhere are
already under his control.

00:06:41.135 --> 00:06:42.404
It's only a matter of time

00:06:42.437 --> 00:06:45.177
before even the kingdoms
of Romos and Papnica fall.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.378
Oh no...

00:06:46.412 --> 00:06:48.584
Then we'd better warn
Leona and King Romos.

00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:51.222
Actually, the Papnica
royal family were the ones

00:06:51.255 --> 00:06:52.992
who told me
where to find you.

00:06:53.025 --> 00:06:55.898
I've come here to teach you
the skills of a true Hero;

00:06:55.932 --> 00:06:58.870
so that someday you can
defeat the Dark Lord.

00:06:59.773 --> 00:07:00.675
So, Dai...

00:07:00.708 --> 00:07:02.912
Are you willing to
take on the challenge?

00:07:02.945 --> 00:07:03.881
I must warn you.

00:07:03.914 --> 00:07:05.818
My training's not for
the faint of heart.

00:07:05.851 --> 00:07:08.791
It'll be harder than
anything you've done before.

00:07:08.824 --> 00:07:09.593
I'm in.

00:07:09.626 --> 00:07:10.761
If Leona's in trouble,

00:07:10.794 --> 00:07:12.732
I'll do whatever it
takes to keep her safe.

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:14.636
Plus, if we don't
stop the Dark Lord,

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:17.174
he'll come after Grampa
and the others, too!

00:07:17.207 --> 00:07:18.978
I can't let that happen!

00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:19.846
So please...

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:20.782
Train me to fight.

00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:23.119
I don't care how hard
it's going to be.

00:07:23.921 --> 00:07:24.956
That's the spirit.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.927
[distant screeching]

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.962
Popp: We've got company.

00:07:29.164 --> 00:07:30.634
Brass: Gargoyles!

00:07:31.936 --> 00:07:33.273
I see humans.

00:07:33.306 --> 00:07:34.809
I see lunch.

00:07:37.113 --> 00:07:39.018
[pained groans]

00:07:39.051 --> 00:07:39.952
What was that?!

00:07:40.353 --> 00:07:41.924
Very clever...

00:07:41.957 --> 00:07:42.758
What?

00:07:42.792 --> 00:07:44.629
It's some kind
of magical barrier.

00:07:44.662 --> 00:07:46.198
They've sealed off
the whole island.

00:07:46.231 --> 00:07:49.572
These two must be scouts
from the Dark Lord's army.

00:07:49.605 --> 00:07:51.442
Why don't you deal
with them, Popp?

00:07:51.476 --> 00:07:54.214
Huh?! You mean by myself?

00:07:54.247 --> 00:07:55.785
Casting that
purification Glimmer

00:07:55.818 --> 00:07:57.688
took a huge
amount of energy.

00:07:57.721 --> 00:07:59.726
I still need some
time to recover.

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:02.230
But, wait - I need
more training, Master!

00:08:02.263 --> 00:08:03.433
Don't push...

00:08:03.466 --> 00:08:05.705
I get it. Trial by fire.

00:08:05.738 --> 00:08:08.009
Come and get me,
you flying dung-heaps!

00:08:08.043 --> 00:08:09.646
Sticks and stones...

00:08:09.679 --> 00:08:11.516
I'll break your bones!

00:08:12.484 --> 00:08:14.088
Kafrizz!

00:08:14.121 --> 00:08:15.591
[shrieking]

00:08:19.932 --> 00:08:21.803
Brass [thought]: I didn't
think someone so young

00:08:21.837 --> 00:08:23.974
could be such a
powerful magic user.

00:08:24.008 --> 00:08:27.180
It seems this tutor is
the real deal after all.

00:08:27.582 --> 00:08:28.650
Why, you...

00:08:29.586 --> 00:08:32.324
So is it two-for-one
fried chicken today?

00:08:32.357 --> 00:08:34.127
Frizzle!

00:08:36.833 --> 00:08:37.935
Uh-oh...

00:08:39.972 --> 00:08:41.142
You were saying?

00:08:41.175 --> 00:08:42.912
[panicking cries]

00:08:42.945 --> 00:08:44.281
Come on, Popp.

00:08:44.314 --> 00:08:47.021
I taught you how Gargoyles
can use Frizzle spells

00:08:47.054 --> 00:08:49.959
to paralyze their
opponents two days ago.

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:54.836
What's this?!

00:08:54.869 --> 00:08:57.241
Servant of the Dark Lord...

00:08:57.274 --> 00:08:59.144
Or, whatever you are...

00:09:00.147 --> 00:09:01.683
Get off this island!

00:09:02.117 --> 00:09:03.820
[attacking yell]

00:09:08.229 --> 00:09:09.297
Get back!

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:13.105
Careful!

00:09:24.996 --> 00:09:26.499
Give that a try.

00:09:26.533 --> 00:09:29.304
Legend has it that blade
can't be defeated.

00:09:45.671 --> 00:09:48.677
It'll take more than just
a scratch to put me down,

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:50.112
you little vermin!

00:09:51.248 --> 00:09:52.184
[battle cry]

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:54.020
You asked for it!

00:10:10.655 --> 00:10:12.023
No way...

00:10:13.226 --> 00:10:14.194
You did it!

00:10:14.228 --> 00:10:15.396
I don't believe it!

00:10:15.429 --> 00:10:17.233
That must be some
sword, Master.

00:10:17.267 --> 00:10:20.440
Avan [thought]: Hmm, it's
actually just a cheap old thing

00:10:20.473 --> 00:10:21.943
I picked up at a pawn shop...

00:10:21.976 --> 00:10:23.647
But this young man seems like

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.753
he's going to be a
much more valuable find.

00:10:27.555 --> 00:10:28.623
Thank you!

00:10:28.657 --> 00:10:30.393
So, what's my next
lesson, Master Avan?

00:10:30.427 --> 00:10:32.264
Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

00:10:32.297 --> 00:10:35.403
See here, Popp; as you're
now the senior student,

00:10:35.436 --> 00:10:37.708
you will be personally
responsible for Dai's safety.

00:10:37.741 --> 00:10:38.744
Get some rest.

00:10:38.777 --> 00:10:41.048
Nice to meet you,
Mister Popp!

00:10:41.081 --> 00:10:42.718
It's just Popp.

00:10:44.656 --> 00:10:46.024
There's a lot to cover.

00:10:46.058 --> 00:10:48.964
My training usually takes months
or even years to complete,

00:10:48.997 --> 00:10:50.934
but since we're
short on time here...

00:10:50.968 --> 00:10:53.974
The only way to get you
up to speed is by giving you

00:10:54.008 --> 00:10:56.947
the one week
"Special Hard Course."

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.654
What?! I can actually
be a Hero in a week?

00:11:00.687 --> 00:11:02.558
Only if it doesn't
kill you first.

00:11:02.592 --> 00:11:04.462
Trust me. You don't
want to do this.

00:11:04.495 --> 00:11:05.697
Avan: Don't scare him!

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.271
Avan: You know, you're always
welcome to join us, Popp.

00:11:09.305 --> 00:11:10.240
That's okay, Master.

00:11:10.273 --> 00:11:13.245
I'm fine with the
totally normal training.

00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:14.583
Sounds great. I'll do it!

00:11:14.616 --> 00:11:15.518
What?!

00:11:15.551 --> 00:11:16.853
If I'm going to save Leona,

00:11:16.886 --> 00:11:20.092
then I need to beef up
as soon as possible.

00:11:20.126 --> 00:11:21.161
Very good.

00:11:21.194 --> 00:11:23.801
In that case, we'll start
first thing tomorrow.

00:11:23.834 --> 00:11:26.105
I was sorta hoping
for something sooner.

00:11:26.138 --> 00:11:28.811
Patience, Dai.
Master Avan needs his rest.

00:11:28.844 --> 00:11:30.146
He's had a long journey,

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.486
and you know perfectly well
how tiring magic can be.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.822
Listen to your grampa.

00:11:34.855 --> 00:11:38.229
For now, let's all relax
and get our strength back.

00:11:38.263 --> 00:11:40.199
Right, I understand!

00:11:40.233 --> 00:11:42.505
Well, at least that
makes one of us.

00:11:42.539 --> 00:11:44.174
You'll never make it, kid.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:02.110
[powered-up yell]

00:12:02.611 --> 00:12:03.847
[startled grunt]

00:12:06.653 --> 00:12:09.357
Well, Dai. Don't say
I didn't warn you.

00:12:31.836 --> 00:12:32.972
All right, Dai.

00:12:33.005 --> 00:12:34.876
I want you to slice
this boulder in half.

00:12:34.909 --> 00:12:36.813
Really? But how?

00:12:36.847 --> 00:12:39.150
You showed skill
with this yesterday.

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:43.893
[battle cry]

00:12:45.329 --> 00:12:48.402
Oh no! I swear I didn't
mean to break it, Master.

00:12:48.436 --> 00:12:49.906
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

00:12:49.939 --> 00:12:51.242
-Not to worry.
-I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

00:12:51.275 --> 00:12:53.980
How about you try using
your dagger instead?

00:12:54.749 --> 00:12:56.017
Okay.

00:12:56.051 --> 00:12:57.387
Avan [thought]:
For ten gold coins,

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.892
I'm amazed that sword's
lasted this long.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:11.617
I can't... It's no use.

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:13.286
You're just not ready yet...

00:13:13.319 --> 00:13:15.389
Why don't we see if
another spin around

00:13:15.423 --> 00:13:16.626
the island does the trick.

00:13:16.659 --> 00:13:20.834
[determined yell]

00:13:23.305 --> 00:13:26.813
Avan: Alright; now for our
standard training course.

00:13:30.587 --> 00:13:32.123
Hey, Dai; you gonna be okay?

00:13:32.157 --> 00:13:34.962
First; let's practice
our Avan Style basics.

00:13:39.705 --> 00:13:42.443
Now for some Avan Style
unarmed combat.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.354
And we can't forget magic...

00:13:47.387 --> 00:13:50.393
I don't see how this
is supposed to help us.

00:13:50.426 --> 00:13:51.362
It's meditation.

00:13:51.395 --> 00:13:54.300
We're balancing
ourselves inside and out.

00:13:57.975 --> 00:14:00.012
Avan: Now for
some spell practice.

00:14:03.887 --> 00:14:05.489
Now... Crackle!

00:14:09.131 --> 00:14:11.368
You froze the whole wave?!
That's amazing.

00:14:12.003 --> 00:14:14.040
It's really not a big deal.

00:14:14.074 --> 00:14:16.946
I've been training with
Master Avan for over a year.

00:14:16.979 --> 00:14:18.248
You'll catch up.

00:14:24.662 --> 00:14:25.798
Come on!

00:14:25.831 --> 00:14:27.000
Avan: Once again,

00:14:27.034 --> 00:14:29.171
you fail to see things
the whole way through.

00:14:29.204 --> 00:14:33.212
The foundation of all magic
is focus. So focus, Popp.

00:14:33.245 --> 00:14:34.013
Right.

00:14:34.849 --> 00:14:36.552
Now, Dai. Let's see
what you've got.

00:14:39.658 --> 00:14:41.394
And... Crack!

00:14:46.471 --> 00:14:49.244
Avan: Well, his potential
certainly isn't in magic.

00:14:49.277 --> 00:14:51.015
Popp: And to think
I was worried

00:14:51.048 --> 00:14:52.484
he might be better than me.

00:14:52.518 --> 00:14:54.922
Avan: Perhaps we'll
try something different.

00:14:54.955 --> 00:14:56.424
Sword practice!

00:14:59.965 --> 00:15:02.070
Avan [thought]: There.
That's more like it.

00:15:02.103 --> 00:15:04.174
I had a feeling his
natural talents would

00:15:04.208 --> 00:15:06.111
lend themselves
better to swordplay.

00:15:10.253 --> 00:15:11.623
Don't worry, little friend.

00:15:11.656 --> 00:15:13.794
Master Avan knows
what he's doing.

00:15:13.827 --> 00:15:15.564
Besides, I didn't
think I'd ever see

00:15:15.597 --> 00:15:18.001
Dai train quite so seriously.

00:15:22.176 --> 00:15:25.016
Avan: Now you look
like you're ready.

00:15:25.049 --> 00:15:27.487
It's time to
give it another go.

00:15:29.892 --> 00:15:32.129
But Master, I don't
have anything left.

00:15:32.163 --> 00:15:34.602
One more time.
Just trust me, Dai.

00:15:35.469 --> 00:15:37.206
Fine. Here goes...

00:15:49.732 --> 00:15:51.368
How did I do it?

00:15:53.372 --> 00:15:55.109
I told you warriors
need their rest,

00:15:55.142 --> 00:15:56.746
but sometimes when
we're exhausted,

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.384
our movements
become more natural.

00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:03.058
And simple moves allow you
to better focus your energy.

00:16:03.092 --> 00:16:06.365
You tended to move the
blade around too much...

00:16:06.398 --> 00:16:09.004
Avan: But the raw strength
to slice this boulder

00:16:09.037 --> 00:16:10.741
has always been within you.

00:16:10.774 --> 00:16:12.310
That makes sense.

00:16:12.343 --> 00:16:13.647
Wow, Master.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.316
You're a really good tutor.

00:16:17.788 --> 00:16:20.661
Popp [thought]: Nobody ever
cuts the rock on the first day!

00:16:20.694 --> 00:16:22.430
Well done, Dai.

00:16:23.934 --> 00:16:29.177
[snoring]

00:16:29.211 --> 00:16:31.414
He really must
have been exhausted.

00:16:31.448 --> 00:16:33.753
[snoring]

00:16:33.786 --> 00:16:36.125
Master, are you sure
this kid'll make it through

00:16:36.158 --> 00:16:38.796
this Special Hard Course
thing in one piece?

00:16:39.532 --> 00:16:40.967
Absolutely.

00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:42.705
He's driven to
rescue his friends,

00:16:42.738 --> 00:16:44.107
and with that kind
of motivation,

00:16:44.141 --> 00:16:46.244
I have no doubt
he'll be fine.

00:16:49.117 --> 00:16:50.554
So, Popp...

00:16:50.588 --> 00:16:54.562
My offer still stands if you'd
like to start training with us.

00:17:00.072 --> 00:17:03.680
[determined yell]

00:17:24.087 --> 00:17:25.123
Avan [thought]:
Excellent.

00:17:25.156 --> 00:17:26.491
You've only been
training for two days,

00:17:26.525 --> 00:17:29.765
and you're already making
me use both my hands.

00:17:35.109 --> 00:17:37.682
I must say,
I'm truly impressed.

00:17:37.715 --> 00:17:39.017
It hasn't even been a week,

00:17:39.051 --> 00:17:41.421
but your progress
is quite astounding.

00:17:41.454 --> 00:17:43.593
We must've found your talent.

00:17:43.626 --> 00:17:46.565
As a reward, I'm going to
show you something special.

00:17:50.105 --> 00:17:52.343
It's my signature
power attack.

00:17:52.377 --> 00:17:54.883
The sooner you can
learn this, the better...

00:17:54.916 --> 00:17:55.817
Ready?

00:17:59.592 --> 00:18:01.028
Master, you're not...

00:18:01.061 --> 00:18:02.798
Avan: Avan Strash!

00:18:05.938 --> 00:18:07.073
Are you kidding me?

00:18:07.106 --> 00:18:09.110
He just went and showed
him his best attack.

00:18:09.143 --> 00:18:10.981
It's that strong
with just a stick?

00:18:11.014 --> 00:18:13.085
So how do I learn
how to do it?

00:18:13.119 --> 00:18:14.020
Avan: Well, Popp...

00:18:14.054 --> 00:18:15.356
Are you ready to join us,

00:18:15.389 --> 00:18:17.628
or would you rather
keep eavesdropping?

00:18:17.661 --> 00:18:19.131
What?! I'm not.

00:18:19.164 --> 00:18:21.836
I was uh...
Going for a walk!

00:18:21.869 --> 00:18:25.176
Avan: My sword technique
uses three elementary forces.

00:18:25.209 --> 00:18:27.682
The earth, the sea, and air.

00:18:27.715 --> 00:18:31.154
You'll learn how to slice
through every one of them.

00:18:31.188 --> 00:18:33.359
Dai: Hold on...
You can cut air?

00:18:33.392 --> 00:18:36.131
Yes, but it's the
hardest one of them all.

00:18:36.164 --> 00:18:38.636
The first you'll learn
is the Earth Slash.

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:41.075
The key to this
move is brute force.

00:18:41.108 --> 00:18:42.644
You'll have fun with it.

00:18:56.037 --> 00:18:58.275
Avan Style Sword Technique...

00:18:59.679 --> 00:19:00.847
Earth Slash!

00:19:09.064 --> 00:19:10.266
Nicely done.

00:19:10.299 --> 00:19:12.805
Your Earth Slash is
coming along wonderfully.

00:19:12.838 --> 00:19:15.910
That's only because it's the
easiest one of them all, Master.

00:19:15.944 --> 00:19:19.551
Can we please jump straight
to the Avan Strash next?

00:19:20.018 --> 00:19:21.221
Afraid not...

00:19:21.254 --> 00:19:23.559
There's an order to
these things for a reason.

00:19:23.593 --> 00:19:25.129
Avan: First you
slice the earth,

00:19:25.162 --> 00:19:26.666
then the sea, then the air.

00:19:26.699 --> 00:19:29.003
And once you've
mastered all of them,

00:19:29.036 --> 00:19:30.740
then you'll
unlock Avan Strash.

00:19:30.774 --> 00:19:34.180
I see. Guess I've still
got a long way to go.

00:19:37.988 --> 00:19:39.023
You there, Popp?

00:19:39.057 --> 00:19:39.759
Popp: No?

00:19:39.792 --> 00:19:40.694
Instead of hiding,

00:19:40.727 --> 00:19:42.631
you should come out
and give Dai a hand.

00:19:42.665 --> 00:19:43.900
Yes, sir!

00:19:49.043 --> 00:19:51.081
Popp: There. You rest
up until dinner.

00:19:51.114 --> 00:19:52.518
Thanks, Popp.

00:19:52.551 --> 00:19:55.890
So you're really not giving
up on this, are you, Dai?

00:19:56.859 --> 00:19:57.928
That's right.

00:19:57.961 --> 00:19:59.330
Either you're out
of your mind,

00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:02.470
or you've got a serious crush
on that Papnica Princess.

00:20:03.673 --> 00:20:04.608
You got me.

00:20:05.443 --> 00:20:07.446
You are so naïve.

00:20:17.334 --> 00:20:19.003
It's getting late...

00:20:19.036 --> 00:20:21.208
Sorry dinner's
taking me so long.

00:20:21.241 --> 00:20:22.611
Oh! Fine, fine.

00:20:22.644 --> 00:20:24.715
I just get carried
away training Dai.

00:20:24.748 --> 00:20:27.354
He's been making such
excellent progress.

00:20:27.387 --> 00:20:29.290
And Popp is, as well.

00:20:29.323 --> 00:20:30.493
Are you sure?

00:20:30.527 --> 00:20:31.194
Oh, yes.

00:20:31.228 --> 00:20:32.429
Popp's always struggled to

00:20:32.463 --> 00:20:34.400
fully commit himself
to the training.

00:20:34.434 --> 00:20:35.804
Any time things
get difficult,

00:20:35.837 --> 00:20:38.442
he tends to throw in
the towel and take a nap.

00:20:38.475 --> 00:20:39.979
But ever since we came here,

00:20:40.012 --> 00:20:41.716
Dai's sparked his curiosity.

00:20:41.749 --> 00:20:43.954
He keeps spying on
the advanced lessons.

00:20:43.987 --> 00:20:45.757
Dai's a good influence.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:46.892
Before I forget...

00:20:46.926 --> 00:20:48.930
Tomorrow's lesson might
get a little chaotic.

00:20:48.964 --> 00:20:51.467
Is there a place around
here where we won't be

00:20:51.502 --> 00:20:53.205
a disturbance to
the other monsters?

00:20:53.238 --> 00:20:55.577
What could disturb monsters?

00:20:56.411 --> 00:20:57.915
Avan: Since you've
managed to learn

00:20:57.948 --> 00:20:59.318
the Earth Slash
so quickly,

00:20:59.351 --> 00:21:00.653
we have an extra day.

00:21:00.687 --> 00:21:03.225
So, we're going to use
it to test your skills,

00:21:03.258 --> 00:21:04.494
and if I'm right,

00:21:04.528 --> 00:21:06.666
you'll unlock the Wave
Slash while you're at it.

00:21:06.699 --> 00:21:07.667
Yes sir.

00:21:07.701 --> 00:21:10.372
However, if you're not
careful with this one...

00:21:10.405 --> 00:21:11.509
You could die.

00:21:13.513 --> 00:21:16.084
Dai: What sort of
training is this, Master?

00:21:16.117 --> 00:21:17.219
Very simple.

00:21:17.253 --> 00:21:19.257
You're going to fight me.

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:20.627
Dai: That's it?

00:21:20.661 --> 00:21:21.629
That's it.

00:21:21.663 --> 00:21:24.467
But this time, I'll be
using a special spell.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.340
You can use your blade,
but I won't be injured by it.

00:21:27.373 --> 00:21:28.710
The dagger from Papnica?

00:21:28.743 --> 00:21:31.080
The very same,
but rest assured, Dai.

00:21:31.114 --> 00:21:32.416
It's guaranteed
to make my skin

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:34.588
harder than any
kind of steel.

00:21:38.162 --> 00:21:40.299
Now, you might
want to stand back.

00:21:40.332 --> 00:21:44.141
[powered-up yell]

00:21:44.174 --> 00:21:45.644
Here we go-

00:21:45.677 --> 00:21:46.946
Puff!

00:21:56.799 --> 00:21:59.738
A dragon? That really
is some spell.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.435
Narrator: To complete
his training

00:23:38.468 --> 00:23:39.939
in Avan Style Sword Technique,

00:23:39.972 --> 00:23:42.410
Dai faces off
against his master...

00:23:42.443 --> 00:23:43.713
Only, Avan's
dragon form is

00:23:43.747 --> 00:23:45.851
stronger than
anything he's faced.

00:23:45.884 --> 00:23:48.756
Our young hero must put together
everything he's learned

00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:50.894
and use his wits to
survive the battle...

00:23:50.927 --> 00:23:53.666
But soon the evil forces
lurking outside the island

00:23:53.699 --> 00:23:56.204
tear through the magic barrier.

00:23:56.237 --> 00:23:57.808
Don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:57.841 --> 00:24:00.279
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:00.312 --> 00:24:02.884
"The Dark Lord
Hadlar's Return".
