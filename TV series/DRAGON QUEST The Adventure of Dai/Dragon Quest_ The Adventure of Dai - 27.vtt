WEBVTT

00:02:08.924 --> 00:02:10.360
Baran: Dino...

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.284
Does it hurt? I bet it does.

00:02:25.057 --> 00:02:29.332
You're tougher than I thought,
and it's making me angry.

00:02:29.365 --> 00:02:31.069
Popp [thought]:
I've got to fight back...

00:02:31.102 --> 00:02:34.008
While I still have
stamina and Magic Power,

00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:36.547
I have to do something!

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.886
O-Oh! I like that
face right there.

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:44.429
I know. How about...
I do what you did to Ruud...

00:02:44.462 --> 00:02:46.065
And take off your head!

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.836
[cackling]

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:49.305
That's it. That's the look!

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:52.177
Just keep that expression.

00:02:55.751 --> 00:02:56.787
[terrified breath]

00:02:59.893 --> 00:03:01.495
[pained grunts]

00:03:02.331 --> 00:03:04.234
Larhart: Who's there?

00:03:11.984 --> 00:03:14.288
Well, that's great.

00:03:14.322 --> 00:03:17.562
I'm saved by the last
guy I want saving me.

00:03:17.595 --> 00:03:20.801
Sorry to disappoint you, Popp.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.749
Popp: Hyunckel...

00:03:27.782 --> 00:03:30.788
I guess I should really be
saying thanks, huh?

00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:36.499
I see.

00:03:36.533 --> 00:03:39.105
So this young man
is the Hyunckel

00:03:39.138 --> 00:03:41.442
that Master Baran spoke of.

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:49.391
You needed help.

00:03:49.425 --> 00:03:51.396
It looks like
you might have been

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:55.070
overextending
yourself out here, Popp.

00:03:55.103 --> 00:03:56.439
Did you really think...

00:03:56.472 --> 00:03:59.245
That you could stop these
three all by yourself?

00:03:59.278 --> 00:04:00.982
It's not like I had a choice.

00:04:01.015 --> 00:04:02.752
Somebody had to do it.

00:04:06.627 --> 00:04:12.171
And Dai he... had his...
memories erased...

00:04:12.204 --> 00:04:14.475
by his father, Baran!

00:04:15.176 --> 00:04:16.513
[surprised gasp]

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:20.253
Hyunckel [thought]:
So Dai and Baran

00:04:20.287 --> 00:04:23.259
are related by
blood after all.

00:04:23.292 --> 00:04:27.768
But... what's this about
his memories being erased?

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.616
Well, then...
Where's Baran now?

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.356
He went ahead to
try and capture Dai.

00:04:39.258 --> 00:04:40.561
All right...

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:47.675
That means we don't have any
time to waste on these pawns.

00:04:49.278 --> 00:04:51.148
What was that?

00:04:51.182 --> 00:04:54.488
That cocky little bastard.

00:04:54.523 --> 00:04:58.030
Former Undead Legion
Commander or not,

00:04:58.063 --> 00:05:00.801
he's still only human.

00:05:00.835 --> 00:05:06.913
I'll slice you up just like that
idiot kid you tried to rescue.

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.352
Hey, Popp...

00:05:09.385 --> 00:05:12.458
You can finish off that one.

00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:16.031
Time to pay him back for all
the pain he inflicted upon you.

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.006
Are you sure?

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:21.911
I'll be taking your spotlight.

00:05:21.944 --> 00:05:23.246
Oh, come on!

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:25.585
You cannot be serious.

00:05:25.618 --> 00:05:28.056
Look at him - he's done for.

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:30.227
That little dweeb
can't fight me!

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.665
It's your turn now, tough guy.

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:34.703
You'll see.

00:05:34.736 --> 00:05:36.940
There's no way
you can beat Popp.

00:05:39.145 --> 00:05:42.017
However... If by
chance you should...

00:05:42.051 --> 00:05:44.522
Then I will challenge you.

00:05:45.825 --> 00:05:47.562
[grumbling]

00:05:48.698 --> 00:05:51.971
Galdandy: This one
is a complete moron.

00:05:52.004 --> 00:05:56.746
You're about to let the
guy you saved get slaughtered.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:57.682
[chuckle]

00:05:57.715 --> 00:05:59.151
Fine, then.

00:06:00.454 --> 00:06:05.163
This time I'm going
to finish the job...

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:10.608
Galdandy: And then
I'll be coming for you!

00:06:15.383 --> 00:06:18.089
Pop [thought]: All I need
are two more spells...

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.832
I hope my Magic
Power holds out!

00:06:22.866 --> 00:06:25.738
[roaring]

00:06:26.005 --> 00:06:27.742
Perish!

00:06:27.776 --> 00:06:29.411
Levizoom!

00:06:31.917 --> 00:06:36.091
What a joke. You want
to fight me in the air?

00:06:37.495 --> 00:06:39.131
What? How did he...

00:06:39.164 --> 00:06:43.039
I told you, you
can't defeat Popp.

00:06:44.876 --> 00:06:46.947
I hit you with
my Bloody Scryde.

00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:49.919
It always leaves a mark.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.461
You better believe
it, bird-face.

00:06:54.494 --> 00:06:57.836
Now you can have the
rest of my Magic Power!

00:06:57.869 --> 00:06:58.870
Bang!

00:07:07.522 --> 00:07:08.924
Borahorn: Galdandy!

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:15.437
I-I did it.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.675
Only, now my...

00:07:17.709 --> 00:07:21.750
My... My Magic Power
is all spent.

00:07:23.152 --> 00:07:25.156
Hyunckel: You've done well.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.597
Get some rest,
and don't worry.

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:33.038
Popp: I'm not worried.

00:07:33.072 --> 00:07:38.082
Your attitude might suck,
but I know how strong you are.

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:44.896
I think... I'll be taking
you up on getting that rest.

00:07:54.916 --> 00:07:58.557
Hyunckel [thought]: You
truly did a good job, Popp.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.730
Borahorn: Curse you!

00:08:01.763 --> 00:08:04.969
How dare you do
that to Galdandy?

00:08:06.305 --> 00:08:09.478
You're going
to pay for this!

00:08:09.512 --> 00:08:12.317
Oh, I'm gonna
"pay for it," huh?

00:08:12.351 --> 00:08:13.887
Yeah, that's right!

00:08:13.921 --> 00:08:17.995
This time, I, Borahorn
shall squash you like...

00:08:18.028 --> 00:08:23.206
[pained roar]

00:08:23.239 --> 00:08:24.308
Larhart: Borahorn!

00:08:24.341 --> 00:08:26.311
[pained groans]

00:08:26.345 --> 00:08:28.015
Hyunckel: You're
the ones who'll pay.

00:08:29.017 --> 00:08:32.157
Hyunckel: I don't know
who you goons are...

00:08:35.163 --> 00:08:38.035
Larhart [thought]:
That's an imposing Aura.

00:08:39.371 --> 00:08:44.014
Hyunckel: ...but after what
you did to my junior disciple,

00:08:44.048 --> 00:08:48.022
do not expect to
walk away from this!

00:08:48.056 --> 00:08:53.165
Borahorn: You, little...
You broke my precious tusks.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:56.005
I'll pulverize you!

00:08:56.038 --> 00:09:01.248
Why don't we just get this
over with? I'm in a hurry.

00:09:01.281 --> 00:09:05.389
Borahorn: This brat.
You think you're so strong?

00:09:05.423 --> 00:09:08.463
The strength of
Sea Rider Borahorn,

00:09:08.496 --> 00:09:11.570
is unrivaled in
the entire world!

00:09:11.603 --> 00:09:14.174
Now, taste it for yourself!

00:09:20.587 --> 00:09:22.023
It can't be...

00:09:22.057 --> 00:09:26.566
Where does such a frail human
body hide this kind of strength?

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.039
Is this the extent of
your "unrivaled" power?

00:09:30.072 --> 00:09:31.876
Disappointing.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:38.289
A friend of mine has twice this
strength in his little finger.

00:09:38.322 --> 00:09:40.727
Why, you...

00:09:48.777 --> 00:09:51.883
Hyunckel: Well? Weren't
you going to pulverize me?

00:09:54.756 --> 00:09:56.993
Borahorn:
I was just about to.

00:09:58.262 --> 00:10:00.834
Glacial Breath!

00:10:05.878 --> 00:10:08.115
Larhart [thought]:
That should finish it.

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:13.259
Borahorn's Glacial Breath is as
strong as any Kacrackle spell.

00:10:25.283 --> 00:10:27.221
[menacing chuckle]

00:10:27.254 --> 00:10:29.091
Borahorn [thought]:
If I strike someone

00:10:29.124 --> 00:10:33.366
when they're frozen solid
by my Glacial Breath...

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:36.271
They shatter like glass.

00:10:37.609 --> 00:10:40.914
This is how I always win.

00:10:45.591 --> 00:10:49.699
As promised,
I'll pulverize you!

00:10:54.943 --> 00:10:58.082
Borahorn [thought]:
What's that? What is he doing?

00:10:58.115 --> 00:11:02.023
No, he can't even move!
How could he?!

00:11:02.525 --> 00:11:05.263
Now shatter!

00:11:08.002 --> 00:11:09.204
What?!

00:11:14.348 --> 00:11:16.485
No way! That armor...

00:11:16.519 --> 00:11:19.424
My Glacial Breath
had no effect?!

00:11:32.652 --> 00:11:34.789
Hyunckel: Playtime is over!

00:11:40.701 --> 00:11:43.272
Bloody Scryde!

00:11:43.305 --> 00:11:48.449
[pained gurgle]

00:12:08.055 --> 00:12:09.024
[gasp]

00:12:09.793 --> 00:12:12.197
Something's strange.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:15.971
I sense... the enemies
have decreased in number.

00:12:28.329 --> 00:12:31.736
Hyunckel: Are you next?
Or do you give up?

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:36.312
Not bad for a human.
But you'll see.

00:12:36.345 --> 00:12:39.953
I won't be as
easy as the other two.

00:12:39.986 --> 00:12:42.759
Don't even try to bluff.

00:12:42.792 --> 00:12:45.496
As you've seen, my armor...

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.603
can repel attack
spells and breath.

00:12:48.636 --> 00:12:50.172
Yes, I'm aware.

00:12:50.206 --> 00:12:54.549
It was forged... by Lon Beruk,
the greatest craftsman...

00:12:54.582 --> 00:12:56.486
in all of the Underworld...

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.957
The Dark Armor Blade.

00:13:00.527 --> 00:13:05.838
Hyunckel: It was a gift.
I never knew who made it.

00:13:05.871 --> 00:13:11.048
I see. Either way,
I wasn't bluffing just now.

00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:14.187
I'm not very good
at most spells,

00:13:14.221 --> 00:13:17.928
but my weapon
still rivals yours.

00:13:19.431 --> 00:13:21.435
Wait, is that?

00:13:21.468 --> 00:13:27.046
Take a good look... at Lon
Beruk's other masterpiece...

00:13:29.919 --> 00:13:32.423
The Dark Armour Spear!

00:13:33.392 --> 00:13:34.895
Amdo!

00:13:57.107 --> 00:13:58.275
Amdo!

00:14:11.468 --> 00:14:13.840
The same armor as mine?

00:14:13.873 --> 00:14:16.245
Larhart: And now we're equal.

00:14:16.278 --> 00:14:20.353
Wait, no... I'm still
a better warrior,

00:14:20.386 --> 00:14:23.526
so I guess I have
the advantage.

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:26.666
We'll see!

00:14:31.977 --> 00:14:34.516
Since you've shown
me your best attack,

00:14:34.549 --> 00:14:36.919
I should repay you in kind.

00:14:48.844 --> 00:14:52.116
Larhart: Observe
my best attack!

00:15:11.823 --> 00:15:13.092
[amused chuckle]

00:15:13.125 --> 00:15:15.965
I'd say that
was a decent dodge,

00:15:15.998 --> 00:15:19.337
but I was merely
giving you a greeting.

00:15:20.541 --> 00:15:23.011
Take a look at your helm.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.101
Tell me...

00:15:34.134 --> 00:15:36.471
Your reputation as
the greatest swordsman

00:15:36.506 --> 00:15:38.577
in the world precedes you,

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:42.551
but do you think you could
do that with your blade?

00:15:44.387 --> 00:15:46.191
Hyunckel [thought]:
He's right.

00:15:46.224 --> 00:15:49.999
Without blinding speed
and needle-point accuracy,

00:15:50.033 --> 00:15:53.405
such a feat is impossible.

00:15:53.438 --> 00:15:58.415
And yet, he did it without
even a scratch on me!

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:04.394
Looks like you understand.

00:16:04.427 --> 00:16:08.269
Indeed, you're a
powerful swordsman...

00:16:08.302 --> 00:16:12.712
But, your blade is all muscle.

00:16:12.745 --> 00:16:15.416
You're no match for me.

00:16:15.449 --> 00:16:21.529
If I wanted to, I'd wager I
could easily strike you down,

00:16:21.562 --> 00:16:22.397
I could win...

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:25.370
Before you even
had a chance to blink.

00:16:25.403 --> 00:16:26.873
Impossible!

00:16:26.906 --> 00:16:29.913
If you're really
as good as you say...

00:16:29.946 --> 00:16:32.083
Then let's see you try!

00:16:40.432 --> 00:16:41.636
That does it.

00:16:42.036 --> 00:16:43.540
Wave Slash!

00:16:50.521 --> 00:16:52.525
Hyunckel [thought]:
Even Wave Slash,

00:16:52.558 --> 00:16:57.233
the fastest Avan Style attack,
couldn't scratch him?

00:16:58.836 --> 00:17:00.640
This appears to be your limit.

00:17:04.582 --> 00:17:08.288
You may have power
in your attacks...

00:17:09.157 --> 00:17:10.426
But even...

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:15.069
with all that power, unless
you can actually hit me,

00:17:15.102 --> 00:17:17.106
it's meaningless.

00:17:32.504 --> 00:17:34.775
Hyunckel [thought]:
It's the same as before...

00:17:34.809 --> 00:17:37.314
I can't see his
strikes at all.

00:17:37.347 --> 00:17:39.585
It's just a flash of light!

00:17:54.047 --> 00:17:55.083
Hyunckel [thought]: Damnit!

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:58.121
I have to do something
about his speed.

00:18:01.028 --> 00:18:02.163
Give it up.

00:18:02.196 --> 00:18:04.635
You'll never see me coming.

00:18:19.131 --> 00:18:22.504
And now, just
as I promised you...

00:18:24.675 --> 00:18:27.213
I shall strike you down.

00:18:31.255 --> 00:18:33.492
Hyunckel [thought]:
He's strong...

00:18:33.527 --> 00:18:36.197
He's on a completely
different level.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.838
He's not at all
like the other two.

00:18:48.055 --> 00:18:53.566
Trying to predict those speed
attacks... is impossible.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:05.289
Oh... You still
haven't given up, yet.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.505
Hyunckel [thought]:
It's a gamble,

00:19:12.538 --> 00:19:15.644
but I'm going to
have to let him hit me...

00:19:15.677 --> 00:19:19.250
and strike back
while he's not moving.

00:19:20.521 --> 00:19:24.595
If I can withstand his
attack and pull him in,

00:19:24.628 --> 00:19:29.639
then I could unleash my
Bloody Scryde straight at him.

00:19:29.672 --> 00:19:33.946
My attacks are still
more devastating than his.

00:19:40.259 --> 00:19:42.330
Very well.

00:19:42.363 --> 00:19:45.369
Then I shall end it with this.

00:19:45.403 --> 00:19:46.772
Die!

00:19:50.179 --> 00:19:51.148
Hyunckel: Now!

00:19:51.181 --> 00:19:53.586
Bloody Scryde!

00:19:57.127 --> 00:19:58.462
Hyunckel [thought]: No...

00:19:58.495 --> 00:20:01.401
He threw his gauntlet
at me instead?!

00:20:04.709 --> 00:20:07.814
I thought that
you might try that.

00:20:07.848 --> 00:20:11.689
Larhart: But I'm not
foolish enough to fall for it.

00:20:12.758 --> 00:20:17.567
Take this! The Land Rider's
most powerful strike!

00:20:18.135 --> 00:20:21.441
Sunder Claw!

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.759
Hyunckel [thought]:
Unbelievable.

00:20:29.792 --> 00:20:33.031
Nothing I could do...
worked on him!

00:20:36.606 --> 00:20:37.974
Dai...

00:20:50.967 --> 00:20:54.575
You are only human,
after all.

00:21:02.691 --> 00:21:06.164
Wait, so you're sensing
a change? Like what?

00:21:06.197 --> 00:21:07.834
[concerned chirps]

00:21:07.868 --> 00:21:10.841
I can't say exactly.

00:21:10.874 --> 00:21:15.282
Nabara: Here. Let me
try my crystal ball, again.

00:21:15.717 --> 00:21:16.786
[gasps]

00:21:16.819 --> 00:21:17.453
That noise...

00:21:17.487 --> 00:21:19.390
[distressed chirps]

00:21:23.667 --> 00:21:24.434
Dai!

00:21:24.467 --> 00:21:27.841
Dai: Someone...
Someone's coming.

00:21:28.743 --> 00:21:30.279
I can tell.

00:21:30.312 --> 00:21:32.684
And I think know him!

00:21:34.722 --> 00:21:39.497
Baran: Dino, no matter
where they hide you...

00:21:39.532 --> 00:21:42.336
I can always
detect where you are.

00:21:45.042 --> 00:21:49.952
For we will always be connected
by the blood in our veins.

00:23:37.768 --> 00:23:39.872
Narrator: As Baran
steadily closes in,

00:23:39.906 --> 00:23:42.343
Popp and Hyunckel
struggle to keep up

00:23:42.376 --> 00:23:44.648
with the final Dragon Master.

00:23:45.951 --> 00:23:47.554
And soon Larhart reveals

00:23:47.587 --> 00:23:50.626
the astonishing
tale of Baran's past.

00:23:51.763 --> 00:23:54.868
But why was Dai separated
from his parents?

00:23:54.902 --> 00:23:58.008
And what was the fate
of his mother, Soala?

00:23:58.041 --> 00:23:58.943
Find out next time on

00:23:58.976 --> 00:24:01.782

The Adventure of Dai,
