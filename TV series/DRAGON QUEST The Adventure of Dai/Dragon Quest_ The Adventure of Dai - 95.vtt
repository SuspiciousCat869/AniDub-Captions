WEBVTT

00:01:50.354 --> 00:01:52.058
That's right, you big jerk.

00:01:52.091 --> 00:01:54.395
Popp: Reflect it!

00:01:59.438 --> 00:02:02.177
Maam [thought]: The mirror!
I almost forgot!

00:02:03.046 --> 00:02:04.849
Sigma: W-Wait a moment...

00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:08.958
Take the Mirror of Shahal.

00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:11.362
You are worthy of wielding it.

00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:17.608
[straining grunts]

00:02:17.642 --> 00:02:19.278
Th-This weighs more
than Crocodine.

00:02:19.312 --> 00:02:20.515
I can't even lift my arm.

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.418
How am I supposed
to fight like this?

00:02:22.451 --> 00:02:24.188
Just wear it as armor instead.

00:02:24.221 --> 00:02:25.925
Keep it hidden
under your tunic.

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.495
Popp: Seriously?
Will that work?

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:29.165
The Mirror of Shahal, it...

00:02:29.198 --> 00:02:30.267
Will not break...

00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:32.840
Not even a crack -
even after I'm gone.

00:02:32.873 --> 00:02:33.975
I want you to keep it...

00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:35.343
to carry it as your own,

00:02:35.377 --> 00:02:37.850
so that it might see you
through to the end...

00:02:37.883 --> 00:02:40.286
and s-serve in my place.

00:02:40.588 --> 00:02:41.723
Sigma...

00:02:41.757 --> 00:02:44.028
Sigma: I know it will
be of some assistance.

00:02:44.062 --> 00:02:46.399
Please, take it with you.

00:02:47.802 --> 00:02:49.471
Maam [thought]: Popp's
had it ever since...

00:02:49.506 --> 00:02:51.743
Popp [thought]: Th-This has
been of a lot more than

00:02:51.777 --> 00:02:53.548
just "some" assistance...

00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:57.021
It's turned out to be the secret
ingredient for our victory.

00:02:57.054 --> 00:02:58.791
Thank you - Sigma.

00:03:12.886 --> 00:03:13.988
Dai [thought]: This is it.

00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:15.591
This is the moment...

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.664
Dai [thought]: Everything's
riding on this next move.

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:20.935
If I don't pull this off,
right here and now,

00:03:20.968 --> 00:03:23.641
we're never gonna get another
chance at beating Vearn!

00:03:23.674 --> 00:03:26.747
My friends all put themselves
on the line to get me here.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.383
I won't let them down.

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:30.955
So I have to give it
everything I've got...

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.828
I need all of my strength!

00:03:33.861 --> 00:03:35.698
You've got this! Do it!

00:03:35.731 --> 00:03:38.637
Avan... Strash!

00:03:42.044 --> 00:03:43.446
True Vearn: D-Don't...

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.287
Don't you dare underestimate
me, foolish little boy!

00:03:49.292 --> 00:03:50.461
Maam [thought]:
H-He can move?!

00:03:50.494 --> 00:03:51.563
Hyunckel [thought]: But how?

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:53.735
He was frozen when
the spell hit him...

00:03:53.768 --> 00:03:55.170
And it was a direct hit.

00:03:55.204 --> 00:03:56.272
Crocodine [thought]:
Those flames...

00:03:56.306 --> 00:03:58.276
No one could survive them.

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:00.882
Leona [thought]: An Overfiend.

00:04:00.915 --> 00:04:02.752
True Vearn [thought]:
Ha! I withstood it!

00:04:02.786 --> 00:04:05.691
Now, I only need to take
care of his Strash...

00:04:06.927 --> 00:04:09.632
and then it's all over!

00:04:10.768 --> 00:04:14.408
Strash... Cross!

00:04:35.618 --> 00:04:38.222
True Vearn [thought]:
My... how?

00:04:38.256 --> 00:04:39.892
This is impossible.

00:04:39.926 --> 00:04:43.199
I should be able to withstand
a strike from any weapon.

00:04:43.232 --> 00:04:45.270
Popp: Dai, h-he... He did it!

00:04:45.303 --> 00:04:46.607
He actually...

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.044
beat the Demonic Guard
of Heaven and Earth!

00:04:49.078 --> 00:04:50.246
Hyunckel [thought]:
That's not all.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.317
The Dark King can never
use that stance again.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.321
Leona [thought]: Even
if he can regrow that arm,

00:04:54.354 --> 00:04:56.426
Draconic Aura works
the same as Dark Aura.

00:04:56.459 --> 00:04:58.931
Any injury it causes
will take time to heal.

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:00.033
Crocodine [thought]: Yes!

00:05:00.067 --> 00:05:03.306
Wounded as he is, Dai's
dealt Vearn a critical blow.

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:05.612
Now he's got the advantage.

00:05:05.645 --> 00:05:07.515
Hym [thought]: Sigma,
wherever you are,

00:05:07.549 --> 00:05:09.319
I hope you see this.

00:05:09.352 --> 00:05:10.789
These Disciples of Avan,

00:05:10.822 --> 00:05:13.426
the ones who we once
called our rivals...

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.098
are far stronger than
we could have imagined.

00:05:16.132 --> 00:05:17.300
That was only the warm-up.

00:05:17.334 --> 00:05:19.973
Stay focused, Dai.
The real fight starts now.

00:05:20.007 --> 00:05:21.810
You haven't beaten me yet!

00:05:28.056 --> 00:05:28.958
Dai!

00:05:28.991 --> 00:05:32.197
I'm not letting go, Vearn.
No matter what!

00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:33.433
[struggling grunts]

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:34.836
Even if it means that...

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:37.208
we're taking this
next one together.

00:05:37.241 --> 00:05:38.744
Zapple!

00:05:42.586 --> 00:05:43.620
Dai!

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:54.141
A-Are you... planning
to... fall with me?

00:05:54.175 --> 00:05:55.343
W-Well...

00:05:55.376 --> 00:05:57.849
I don't have the stamina
to use Giga Strash.

00:05:57.882 --> 00:05:59.085
And even if...

00:05:59.118 --> 00:06:01.757
you can't use the Demonic Guard
of Heaven and Earth anymore,

00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:04.996
you aren't likely to just stand
there and let a spell hit you.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.967
You could still counter...

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.969
But this way,

00:06:08.003 --> 00:06:09.640
I'm one hundred percent
guaranteed to hit you.

00:06:09.673 --> 00:06:11.577
Let's see who lasts longer!

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.279
You'll have to do
better than this!

00:06:13.313 --> 00:06:15.852
C'mon... just one
m-more... t-time...

00:06:15.885 --> 00:06:17.153
Zapple!

00:06:24.936 --> 00:06:27.608
Now, it's like... The gods
are truly fighting.

00:06:27.642 --> 00:06:30.146
That looks like
Dai's Zapple spell!

00:06:32.451 --> 00:06:33.720
Flora: It could be.

00:06:33.754 --> 00:06:36.726
Let's pray it's not another
attack from Dark Army.

00:06:42.304 --> 00:06:45.043
[suffering roar]

00:06:45.076 --> 00:06:46.813
Dai: Zapple!

00:06:49.485 --> 00:06:50.655
Th-There's no use, Dai.

00:06:50.688 --> 00:06:53.359
Why won't you cease
this futile resistance?

00:06:53.393 --> 00:06:55.063
You can say that
all you want,

00:06:55.096 --> 00:06:56.132
but I'm never giving up.

00:06:56.165 --> 00:06:58.771
I can feel your pull on
me weakening as we speak.

00:06:58.804 --> 00:07:00.473
If I'm slipping,
it's because

00:07:00.507 --> 00:07:03.045
your sword has pierced
one of my three hearts...

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:06.686
Most impressive, except it's
still not enough to kill me!

00:07:07.421 --> 00:07:08.891
Zapple!

00:07:08.924 --> 00:07:11.062
[overwhelmed roar]

00:07:11.095 --> 00:07:12.497
Dai: [pained cry]

00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:14.903
Crocodine [thought]:
How many times is that?

00:07:14.936 --> 00:07:16.072
Maam [thought]: No...

00:07:16.105 --> 00:07:18.611
At... At this rate, it won't
just be Vearn who goes...

00:07:18.644 --> 00:07:20.046
Leona [thought]:
Dai's not planning...

00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:21.784
to make it out of this, is he?

00:07:21.817 --> 00:07:23.052
Dai: Zapple!

00:07:23.086 --> 00:07:25.023
[howling]

00:07:25.825 --> 00:07:27.161
Hey, no!

00:07:27.194 --> 00:07:29.799
True Vearn: [howling]

00:07:38.718 --> 00:07:41.489
Popp [thought]: I...
I can't stop him.

00:07:41.523 --> 00:07:42.826
I wish I could, but...

00:07:42.859 --> 00:07:44.762
The only way to defeat Vearn

00:07:44.796 --> 00:07:47.635
is for Dai to risk
his life like this!

00:07:47.668 --> 00:07:50.908
"Only the Hero can defeat
the Dark King," remember?

00:07:50.941 --> 00:07:54.114
Like Vearn said,
he's not beaten yet...

00:07:54.147 --> 00:07:58.824
Even so, this is
definitely wearing him down.

00:07:58.858 --> 00:08:00.661
Popp [thought]: All the
energy from that lighting...

00:08:00.694 --> 00:08:03.934
It's going directly into his
body through the Sword of Dai.

00:08:03.967 --> 00:08:06.172
That's worse than
a direct hit.

00:08:06.205 --> 00:08:09.311
Even Vearn can't withstand
that much power for long.

00:08:09.345 --> 00:08:11.215
I don't like it,
but I get it.

00:08:11.249 --> 00:08:12.785
So all I'll say is this...

00:08:12.819 --> 00:08:15.456
You'd better not give
out before Vearn does.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.728
That's all, Dai.
Give him hell.

00:08:17.762 --> 00:08:19.632
True Vearn: You have
me at a loss.

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.804
Do you truly not
feel any fear?

00:08:21.837 --> 00:08:23.641
You must have some
doubt in using...

00:08:23.674 --> 00:08:26.914
such a reckless tactic.
Don't deny it!

00:08:26.947 --> 00:08:28.115
Not at all.

00:08:28.149 --> 00:08:31.155
Actually... it'll be easier
to finish you off this way.

00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:34.161
Maybe you can take
me down with you...

00:08:34.194 --> 00:08:37.167
But if you do, at least I'll be
the only one who gets hurt.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.639
Dai: My friends have all put
themselves on the line...

00:08:39.672 --> 00:08:42.845
to make sure that I'd have
this one last chance...

00:08:42.879 --> 00:08:45.985
If they were willing to do that
for me, then why shouldn't I...

00:08:46.018 --> 00:08:48.724
be willing to do
the same for them?

00:08:48.757 --> 00:08:50.260
True Vearn: How sentimental.

00:08:50.293 --> 00:08:53.266
I presume this is the
so-called "bond of souls"

00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:54.603
you mentioned earlier?

00:08:54.636 --> 00:08:56.873
Yeah. That's what it is!

00:09:04.756 --> 00:09:06.358
It isn't enough. Give up.

00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:07.829
Wait... What?!

00:09:07.862 --> 00:09:10.066
All of your efforts
will soon go to waste.

00:09:10.099 --> 00:09:12.004
This bond of souls
you believe in...

00:09:12.037 --> 00:09:14.475
The blood your
companions have spilled...

00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:16.245
Their heroic acts
of sacrifice...

00:09:16.279 --> 00:09:19.184
Before too long, you'll see
it was all an absolutely...

00:09:19.218 --> 00:09:20.621
pointless endeavor.

00:09:20.654 --> 00:09:22.358
Pointless?!

00:09:22.391 --> 00:09:23.392
Indeed.

00:09:23.426 --> 00:09:25.063
Now just stop these
useless attacks.

00:09:25.097 --> 00:09:26.332
I can assure you...

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:28.436
It's for your own good.

00:09:28.469 --> 00:09:30.173
W-What are you talking about?!

00:09:30.206 --> 00:09:31.042
You're wrong...

00:09:31.075 --> 00:09:32.945
There's no way
this was all pointless!

00:09:32.978 --> 00:09:35.250
The only reason I've got
you pinned right now

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:36.485
is thanks to my friends.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.391
You just... want me
to drop my guard!

00:09:39.424 --> 00:09:40.761
True Vearn: You'd
have a point...

00:09:40.794 --> 00:09:41.930
if it weren't for the fact...

00:09:41.964 --> 00:09:43.634
that pinning me
down will do nothing

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:45.437
to stop what comes next.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:46.673
Huh?!

00:09:54.188 --> 00:09:55.123
Maam [thought]: What?!

00:09:55.156 --> 00:09:57.327
Avan [thought]: This
rumbling... Could it be?

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.496
What's that sound?

00:09:58.531 --> 00:09:59.932
Without the Dark
Force Reactor,

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:03.172
Vearn Palace has lost
its main power supply.

00:10:03.205 --> 00:10:05.812
Now, with no means to
control its flight,

00:10:05.845 --> 00:10:08.015
the gravity-defying
properties of the material

00:10:08.048 --> 00:10:10.721
it's constructed of will
lift us higher and higher.

00:10:10.754 --> 00:10:14.395
The surface world has
already drifted far, far away.

00:10:14.428 --> 00:10:16.633
But, despite the
damage you've done...

00:10:16.667 --> 00:10:19.204
it turns out, there's still
one part of the Palace

00:10:19.238 --> 00:10:20.841
which I can control.

00:10:20.874 --> 00:10:24.916
As it happens, it's also a part
which only I can control...

00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:26.418
Observe.

00:10:31.395 --> 00:10:32.565
Dai: The heart?

00:10:32.599 --> 00:10:35.103
But the Dark Force Reactor...
I thought I...

00:10:35.136 --> 00:10:37.007
True Vearn: Yes.
You destroyed it.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.646
Only, I'm not talking
about the reactor.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.250
I'm talking about...
what's beneath it.

00:10:46.593 --> 00:10:48.430
No... What's going on?

00:10:48.463 --> 00:10:51.269
What the heck is that thing?

00:10:51.302 --> 00:10:54.842
True Vearn: Behold, Vearn
Palace's ultimate weapon.

00:10:54.876 --> 00:10:57.046
The Pillar of Vearn!

00:11:22.965 --> 00:11:24.936
True Vearn: Yes,
the Pillar of Vearn.

00:11:24.969 --> 00:11:28.944
I've deployed others just
like it all over the world.

00:11:32.985 --> 00:11:35.023
True Vearn: There are six
of these devices...

00:11:35.056 --> 00:11:38.028
One to go with every
wing of Vearn Palace.

00:11:38.062 --> 00:11:41.603
Each is capable of more
destruction than ten armies.

00:11:41.636 --> 00:11:43.072
I've placed the
others to wipe out

00:11:43.105 --> 00:11:45.778
key kingdoms across the globe.

00:11:45.811 --> 00:11:48.115
True Vearn: All in all,
I've dropped five so far.

00:11:48.149 --> 00:11:50.621
This is the last
pillar that remains.

00:11:50.655 --> 00:11:54.094
What happens if I drop
it below us right now?

00:11:54.763 --> 00:11:55.798
Below us?

00:11:55.831 --> 00:11:57.134
True Vearn:
You know, don't you?

00:11:57.167 --> 00:12:00.106
It will blow away
anything in its path.

00:12:01.309 --> 00:12:02.978
Popp [thought]: Queen
Flora and the others...

00:12:03.012 --> 00:12:04.181
they're right beneath us!

00:12:04.214 --> 00:12:06.786
Don't let him! We've
got people down there!

00:12:10.093 --> 00:12:10.961
No!

00:12:11.729 --> 00:12:14.200
Stop it, now!

00:12:20.915 --> 00:12:22.986
C'mon, Dai! Don't let him -

00:12:23.019 --> 00:12:24.355
S-Stop!

00:12:24.388 --> 00:12:25.323
Stop it!

00:12:25.357 --> 00:12:26.960
No!

00:12:27.294 --> 00:12:29.297
You can't!

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.779
[menacing chuckle]

00:14:12.203 --> 00:14:15.977
Everybody... Queen Flora
and the others...

00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:26.600
True Vearn: Tell me...

00:14:26.633 --> 00:14:28.603
Did you recognize that, Dai?

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:30.908
Huh?

00:14:30.941 --> 00:14:32.177
What I'm asking is...

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:35.951
did you notice anything
familiar about that glow?

00:14:39.759 --> 00:14:42.899
Dai: Is that... no...

00:14:42.932 --> 00:14:45.302
That's a... That's a....

00:14:46.806 --> 00:14:48.208
Dai: A Black Core!

00:14:48.242 --> 00:14:50.514
What?! Oh, not this again!

00:14:50.547 --> 00:14:52.250
Hyunckel [thought]: That's
the infamous super-powered

00:14:52.283 --> 00:14:54.522
explosive from the Underworld.

00:14:54.555 --> 00:14:56.192
Crocodine [thought]:
The same contraption

00:14:56.225 --> 00:15:00.099
the Dark King had
implanted in Hadlar's body?

00:15:00.132 --> 00:15:02.605
Dai [thought]: The magic
bomb that took out Dad...

00:15:02.638 --> 00:15:05.176
There's... There's
more than one?

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:07.214
A Black Core's
destructive power...

00:15:07.247 --> 00:15:09.852
will increase
according to its size.

00:15:09.886 --> 00:15:11.990
This one is over
ten times larger...

00:15:12.023 --> 00:15:14.127
than the Core I put in Hadlar.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.666
Do you realize...
what that means?

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.273
But the one inside Hadlar...

00:15:20.306 --> 00:15:22.812
it blew away the
entire Field of Death.

00:15:22.845 --> 00:15:25.350
Ten times that would
flatten Loroi Valley...

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:28.389
No, it could destroy
the whole Surface World...

00:15:28.422 --> 00:15:30.894
Popp: And there are five
others just like it, too.

00:15:30.927 --> 00:15:32.163
We'll never find them in time.

00:15:32.196 --> 00:15:34.001
True Vearn: You'd already
know where they were,

00:15:34.034 --> 00:15:36.138
if you had only understood
what you witnessed.

00:15:36.171 --> 00:15:38.276
Allow me to jog your memory.

00:15:38.309 --> 00:15:39.845
You humans called my attacks

00:15:39.879 --> 00:15:41.817
on your kingdoms
indiscriminate,

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:43.452
but they were all by design.

00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:46.124
In truth, I was dropping these
pillars where I needed them

00:15:46.158 --> 00:15:48.262
to set the stage
for my endgame.

00:15:48.295 --> 00:15:51.067
True Vearn: First was
Northwest Romos...

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:54.374
Next was Southern Orzam...

00:15:55.845 --> 00:15:57.848
Then Valge Island...

00:15:57.881 --> 00:15:59.919
Western Papnica...

00:15:59.952 --> 00:16:01.890
Ringaia Kingdom...

00:16:01.923 --> 00:16:04.896
And finally, here
in Northern Carl.

00:16:04.929 --> 00:16:06.298
True Vearn: What
happens if you connect

00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:08.736
all those points on a map?

00:16:09.772 --> 00:16:12.009
Popp: It creates a hexagon.

00:16:16.986 --> 00:16:18.222
[horrified breath]

00:16:18.255 --> 00:16:20.627
These massive Black Cores
have been positioned...

00:16:20.661 --> 00:16:24.401
to form the points of a hexagon
encompassing each continent...

00:16:24.434 --> 00:16:27.675
Six pillars of fire
to scorch the surface.

00:16:27.708 --> 00:16:29.579
The Magic Field they
create will increase their

00:16:29.612 --> 00:16:32.150
destructive force to
the greatest magnitude...

00:16:32.183 --> 00:16:35.523
Completely eradicating
the Surface World...

00:16:39.565 --> 00:16:41.869
When the dust of your realm
settles, the Underworld...

00:16:41.903 --> 00:16:44.675
shall ascend to
take its place.

00:16:44.709 --> 00:16:47.581
True Vearn: The sun which
sets on the horizon before us,

00:16:47.615 --> 00:16:52.023
will rise tomorrow and shine
upon my kingdom at last.

00:16:52.056 --> 00:16:55.163
Look at it, Dai. Drink it in.

00:16:55.196 --> 00:16:57.601
This is how our battle ends.

00:16:58.402 --> 00:17:00.306
No...

00:17:02.477 --> 00:17:03.580
N-Not yet...

00:17:03.613 --> 00:17:06.151
Not if I can defeat you before
you make them explode...

00:17:06.184 --> 00:17:07.253
It's not over!

00:17:07.287 --> 00:17:08.455
That's where you're wrong.

00:17:08.489 --> 00:17:11.395
Even if you defeat me,
it will not stop them.

00:17:11.428 --> 00:17:12.598
You're lying!

00:17:12.632 --> 00:17:13.466
It's true.

00:17:13.499 --> 00:17:15.571
I had these made
with built-in timers.

00:17:15.604 --> 00:17:17.040
In a few short minutes,

00:17:17.073 --> 00:17:19.579
they detonate, and the
Surface World will vanish.

00:17:19.612 --> 00:17:20.514
No...

00:17:20.547 --> 00:17:21.849
That won't happen.

00:17:21.883 --> 00:17:23.686
I'll finish you off
and then I'll...

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.223
I'll stop them all myself!

00:17:25.256 --> 00:17:28.462
True Vearn: How exactly will
you be in six places at once?

00:17:29.933 --> 00:17:32.370
True Vearn: Whether it's on the
chessboard or the battlefield,

00:17:32.403 --> 00:17:34.274
a true victor must
move their pieces

00:17:34.308 --> 00:17:36.078
without revealing
their intentions...

00:17:36.111 --> 00:17:38.583
until the final move, that is.

00:17:38.616 --> 00:17:40.286
If anyone who
possessed real strength

00:17:40.319 --> 00:17:41.923
had remained down there,

00:17:41.956 --> 00:17:43.492
There might be a
chance for them...

00:17:43.526 --> 00:17:45.196
to discover the secret
of the Pillars,

00:17:45.229 --> 00:17:47.134
and even remove the Cores...

00:17:47.167 --> 00:17:48.937
And that's the reason...

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:51.041
I issued such an
absurd challenge.

00:17:51.074 --> 00:17:53.179
It's why I chose this
specific location

00:17:53.212 --> 00:17:55.784
as the arena for our combat.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.656
Exactly as I predicted,

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:02.263
you gathered all of your forces
and charged into my trap.

00:18:02.296 --> 00:18:04.467
And here, we have the result.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.506
The mighty Disciples of Avan -

00:18:06.539 --> 00:18:09.177
and their leader
himself - have fallen.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:10.547
They're paralyzed.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.619
There's nothing you or the
Mage can do without them...

00:18:15.991 --> 00:18:17.861
True Vearn: Like
I said, Dai. Give up.

00:18:17.895 --> 00:18:19.464
Because it is over.

00:18:19.498 --> 00:18:21.869
Surely you can
see that by now.

00:18:21.902 --> 00:18:24.909
Surely you understand how
pointless it is to fight...

00:18:24.942 --> 00:18:26.512
any further.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:29.552
No! You're wrong.

00:18:29.585 --> 00:18:31.857
I don't... I don't
accept that!

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:33.192
It can't be pointless.

00:18:33.225 --> 00:18:34.328
It can't be!

00:18:34.361 --> 00:18:37.835
If we... If we all
came this far just to...

00:18:37.868 --> 00:18:39.538
Just to call it quits...

00:18:39.571 --> 00:18:40.473
Then what now?

00:18:40.507 --> 00:18:43.479
Will you strike me down?
Either way, I win.

00:18:43.513 --> 00:18:45.183
True Vearn: If you
continue your attack,

00:18:45.216 --> 00:18:48.222
you may have the power to
beat me, but not the time.

00:18:48.255 --> 00:18:51.061
It will take more than a
few minutes to finish me off,

00:18:51.094 --> 00:18:52.665
I'll make sure of that.

00:18:52.698 --> 00:18:55.002
Still, destroying me
after the Surface World's

00:18:55.035 --> 00:18:58.576
been annihilated might slake
your thirst for vengeance.

00:18:58.609 --> 00:19:00.748
Let me ask,
just to be certain.

00:19:00.781 --> 00:19:01.916
Answer this honestly:

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:03.586
When you began this fight,

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.759
was your objective to
bring about my demise?

00:19:09.932 --> 00:19:11.267
Dai: No...

00:19:14.073 --> 00:19:15.209
The reason...

00:19:15.242 --> 00:19:18.315
I started this fight...
is because I...

00:19:18.348 --> 00:19:21.388
I wanted to protect
the... Surface World.

00:19:21.421 --> 00:19:23.091
To help.

00:19:23.125 --> 00:19:24.461
Yes.

00:19:24.494 --> 00:19:27.834
That which you seek to
protect... will soon be gone.

00:19:32.978 --> 00:19:34.948
True Vearn: It will
all be gone.

00:19:46.906 --> 00:19:48.810
No, Dai...

00:19:53.452 --> 00:19:54.889
Dai [thought]: What is this?

00:19:54.922 --> 00:19:56.090
What's wrong with me?

00:19:56.124 --> 00:20:00.132
Come on. Forget what he says.
The fight isn't over yet!

00:20:00.166 --> 00:20:04.174
N-No... No matter what,
I can't let him do this.

00:20:04.207 --> 00:20:06.045
There's gotta be a way.

00:20:06.078 --> 00:20:08.549
Get up... Get up, Dai!

00:20:11.421 --> 00:20:13.593
Dai [thought]:
S-Something isn't right.

00:20:13.626 --> 00:20:17.433
Why... Why can't I...
Why can't I get up?

00:20:21.008 --> 00:20:23.212
Oh, no... That look...

00:20:23.245 --> 00:20:25.851
Popp: He knows! He must
know Vearn's right.

00:20:25.884 --> 00:20:28.857
Then there's really
nothing he can do...

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:32.062
We came all this way just
for it to end like this?

00:20:32.096 --> 00:20:34.367
After everything
we've been through?!

00:20:35.236 --> 00:20:36.506
D-Damnit!

00:20:36.539 --> 00:20:37.908
Damnit!

00:20:42.383 --> 00:20:44.522
Don't weep.
You should be proud.

00:20:44.555 --> 00:20:47.527
Each one of you fought
exceptionally well.

00:20:58.282 --> 00:21:00.385
Now let us watch together...

00:21:00.419 --> 00:21:02.924
as the Surface World
meets its end.

00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:05.530
A new chapter in history.

00:21:06.565 --> 00:21:08.936
Popp [thought]: It's over...
A-All of it...

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:11.241
All our friends
and families...

00:21:11.274 --> 00:21:13.178
Every single person we know.

00:21:13.211 --> 00:21:15.684
Warriors and world leaders...

00:21:15.717 --> 00:21:18.957
And the innocent people
oblivious to the danger...

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:20.727
Everyone will disappear!

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.767
Soon, the whole
thing's gone forever.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.169
Nothing will be left.

00:21:25.202 --> 00:21:27.406
And we couldn't
do anything about it.

00:21:27.439 --> 00:21:30.613
No matter how hard we tried
or how much we gave up...

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:37.060
In the end...
we still failed.

00:21:37.093 --> 00:21:38.462
There's no stopping it now.

00:21:38.495 --> 00:21:40.800
By unleashing the
final Pillar of Vearn,

00:21:40.833 --> 00:21:43.439
I've activated the timers
installed in the other six.

00:21:43.472 --> 00:21:45.442
The clock is ticking.

00:21:45.476 --> 00:21:47.213
In less than ten minutes,

00:21:47.247 --> 00:21:49.484
all the pillars will
explode at once...

00:21:49.519 --> 00:21:50.754
In less than ten minutes,

00:21:50.787 --> 00:21:54.093
your cursed Surface World
will be laid to waste!

00:21:59.003 --> 00:22:02.978
I can't help feeling...
satisfied, already.

00:23:36.899 --> 00:23:38.970
Narrator: With the last
Pillar of Vearn in place,

00:23:39.003 --> 00:23:42.176
the countdown to the end of
the Surface World has begun...

00:23:42.209 --> 00:23:44.013
and soon the six
Black Cores

00:23:44.046 --> 00:23:46.919
stored within the pillars
let off an ominous glow.

00:23:46.952 --> 00:23:49.357
Realizing Vearn's defeat
will be meaningless,

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:51.796
Dai loses his will
to even stand.

00:23:51.829 --> 00:23:55.369
But then, a voice from Loroi
Valley enters Popp's mind,

00:23:55.402 --> 00:23:57.574
revealing all was
not as it seemed.

00:23:57.607 --> 00:23:58.910
See what unfolds,
next time on

00:23:58.943 --> 00:24:01.281
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:01.314 --> 00:24:03.586
"Like a Bright Flash".
