WEBVTT

00:02:03.246 --> 00:02:04.248
Hyunckel...

00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:05.651
You're alive?!

00:02:05.684 --> 00:02:07.121
You can't be...

00:02:07.154 --> 00:02:09.258
Why, you little...

00:02:26.392 --> 00:02:30.601
Maam: Is this a dream?
Or am I dead?

00:02:31.671 --> 00:02:32.906
You're not dreaming.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.475
And you're not dead.

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:35.077
[gasp]

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.681
Maam: Hyunckel!

00:02:36.714 --> 00:02:37.715
Maam.

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:39.986
You... You're alive.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.457
Oh, thank goodness!

00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:46.767
[jealous gasp]

00:02:47.602 --> 00:02:48.469
Hey, rust bucket!

00:02:48.504 --> 00:02:50.307
You know, I'm still
injured over here.

00:02:50.341 --> 00:02:52.210
Help me out or something!

00:02:52.244 --> 00:02:53.847
Hyunckel: Medicinal
herbs. Try 'em.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.419
Popp: That weasel...

00:02:56.453 --> 00:02:59.994
What ever happened
to equal treatment?!

00:03:00.027 --> 00:03:02.064
Explain this to me, boy.

00:03:02.097 --> 00:03:06.540
How were you not destroyed along
with the Underground Palace?

00:03:06.574 --> 00:03:09.144
You're right.
I shouldn't be here.

00:03:09.178 --> 00:03:11.415
But right then,
in my final moments,

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:14.388
I was saved by
a great warrior.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.229
Hyunckel: Truly,
at the brink of death!

00:03:30.788 --> 00:03:34.629
Hyunckel: So, you
survived... Crocodine.

00:03:34.662 --> 00:03:37.802
Crocodine: My steel hide
could withstand the lava.

00:03:37.836 --> 00:03:41.375
Plus, thankfully, your servants
patched me up quite well.

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.048
I was barely alive
when this Garuda found me.

00:03:44.081 --> 00:03:45.383
[squawk]

00:03:46.754 --> 00:03:49.458
But I was the one
who tried to kill you.

00:03:49.492 --> 00:03:50.962
Why did you save me?

00:03:50.995 --> 00:03:52.532
It was a soldier's mercy

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:54.703
when you ordered them
to treat my wounds.

00:03:54.736 --> 00:03:58.010
Mercy must be repaid
in kind. That's why.

00:03:58.043 --> 00:03:59.947
Besides, from now on,

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.421
you must continue to
help Dai and his friends.

00:04:04.454 --> 00:04:06.527
If mercy was
really your intent,

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.301
then you should have
just left me to my death.

00:04:10.334 --> 00:04:12.471
I had refused to face
my own weaknesses,

00:04:12.506 --> 00:04:15.143
and turned my
hate for Avan...

00:04:15.177 --> 00:04:18.450
into a hatred
for all of humanity.

00:04:18.483 --> 00:04:21.489
Maybe I would have paid the
price for some of my crimes...

00:04:21.524 --> 00:04:22.892
But because I live,

00:04:22.926 --> 00:04:26.031
this shame will continue to
be with me for all my days.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.405
Crocodine: Hyunckel.

00:04:29.438 --> 00:04:32.110
I believe that the worth
of a man lies in how much

00:04:32.143 --> 00:04:34.215
they are able to
let go of the past

00:04:34.248 --> 00:04:36.385
no matter how
painful it may be.

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.962
Be it a life in shame,
and reviled by all you know,

00:04:40.995 --> 00:04:44.034
so long as you walk a
path that you believe in,

00:04:44.068 --> 00:04:45.470
is that not enough?

00:04:46.707 --> 00:04:49.979
The Garuda tells me Dai and
his friends have headed north.

00:04:50.013 --> 00:04:53.019
Probably to Valge Island.

00:04:53.053 --> 00:04:55.190
I'm going to go help them.

00:04:55.223 --> 00:04:56.893
It's the least I can do

00:04:56.927 --> 00:05:00.735
after they've reminded
me of a warrior's honor.

00:05:00.768 --> 00:05:01.670
Hyunckel: Wait!

00:05:03.206 --> 00:05:05.276
You're right, Beast King.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.047
My crimes are too great...

00:05:07.081 --> 00:05:09.552
My demise won't
absolve me of them.

00:05:10.086 --> 00:05:11.323
You and Maam...

00:05:11.356 --> 00:05:13.293
You were the first...

00:05:13.326 --> 00:05:15.765
to ever shed
real tears for me.

00:05:15.798 --> 00:05:18.403
In order to
repay those tears,

00:05:18.437 --> 00:05:20.374
I must... I must...

00:05:20.407 --> 00:05:23.614
I must fight for
the hero and his friends.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.755
What's that?!

00:05:29.458 --> 00:05:31.495
Hyunckel: The Dark
Armour Blade?

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.368
It was lost in the fall
of the Underground Palace...

00:05:34.401 --> 00:05:35.805
How is it here?!

00:05:35.838 --> 00:05:38.944
And it's been completely
repaired, as well.

00:05:38.977 --> 00:05:42.017
Crocodine: They say a true
weapon chooses its wielder.

00:05:42.051 --> 00:05:45.490
Perhaps this Dark Blade
was restored and drawn here

00:05:45.524 --> 00:05:48.362
by the power of
your renewed Aura.

00:05:51.402 --> 00:05:52.805
Hyunckel: Amdo!

00:06:05.397 --> 00:06:06.633
That's it...

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:09.772
Crocodine: So long as you
have the will to fight,

00:06:09.806 --> 00:06:13.379
this armor shall
always find you!

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:17.521
Hyunckel: Thank you,
Beast King!

00:06:19.593 --> 00:06:20.995
Hadlar: Unbelievable!

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:22.497
I never trusted you,

00:06:22.532 --> 00:06:25.838
but for Crocodine to betray
our forces, as well...

00:06:25.871 --> 00:06:27.742
Hyunckel: You'll believe
it when you hear him

00:06:27.775 --> 00:06:30.681
destroy the Dark Flame Spire.

00:06:32.317 --> 00:06:33.787
Can you stand?

00:06:33.821 --> 00:06:34.956
Maam: Yes.

00:06:34.989 --> 00:06:38.764
You head to Valge Tower with
Popp and meet up with Dai.

00:06:38.797 --> 00:06:41.335
You just leave
this battle to me.

00:06:41.368 --> 00:06:42.939
Yes, but you...

00:06:43.874 --> 00:06:46.513
Popp: Well, okay then!
Thanks, pal.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.382
Popp: Good luck!

00:06:48.416 --> 00:06:49.853
Popp, what are you doing?!

00:06:49.886 --> 00:06:50.522
Forget him!

00:06:50.555 --> 00:06:53.694
He said to go, so let's go!

00:06:53.727 --> 00:06:56.866
Popp [thought]: Like I'd let
him touch you a second longer!

00:07:02.545 --> 00:07:04.549
[chuckling]

00:07:04.582 --> 00:07:07.287
All traitors
must suffer death!

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.526
That's the law of
the Dark Army!

00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:12.899
I'm going to make
yours slow and painful!

00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:15.871
Now, how do you want
to die, swordsman?

00:07:15.905 --> 00:07:19.211
Hadlar, are you
taking me seriously?

00:07:19.245 --> 00:07:20.748
Or are you too stupid now

00:07:20.782 --> 00:07:23.353
to tell how strong
your opponents are?

00:07:23.386 --> 00:07:24.454
What?

00:07:34.108 --> 00:07:38.283
These monsters...
aren't even worth my time.

00:07:38.316 --> 00:07:39.653
If you want to kill me,

00:07:39.686 --> 00:07:42.558
do it by risking your
own life you coward.

00:07:42.591 --> 00:07:45.664
You... You brat!

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.114
[roaring charge]

00:07:55.518 --> 00:07:59.058
Don't let him get
any closer to the Spire!

00:07:59.091 --> 00:08:00.627
Get back, old man!

00:08:01.963 --> 00:08:04.669
[vicious snarl]

00:08:04.703 --> 00:08:08.910
Beast King Anguish Blast!

00:08:14.021 --> 00:08:17.561
Zaboera: No!
The Dark Flame Spire!

00:08:27.715 --> 00:08:29.586
Hey, I feel lighter...

00:08:29.619 --> 00:08:31.556
The Curse Field is gone!

00:08:32.357 --> 00:08:34.696
Baduck: What an
astounding attack!

00:08:34.729 --> 00:08:36.032
[agreeing chirps]

00:08:36.065 --> 00:08:37.200
But if you ask me,

00:08:37.233 --> 00:08:40.941
"Anguish Blast" might sound
a little too ominous, now.

00:08:40.975 --> 00:08:44.649
How about something like;
"Beast King Redemption Blast"?

00:08:45.585 --> 00:08:47.287
[laughing]

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.624
Not half bad!

00:08:48.658 --> 00:08:50.761
Thank you, old man.

00:08:54.301 --> 00:08:55.504
Flazzard: Well...

00:08:55.537 --> 00:08:57.107
After all that trouble,
there goes my Curse Field.

00:08:57.141 --> 00:09:01.816
What's Hadlar even doing?

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:07.127
The Spires have fallen.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.131
So now it's your turn.

00:09:10.433 --> 00:09:11.236
My lord!

00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:13.372
All of you, stay back.

00:09:13.405 --> 00:09:16.245
I want to show
him my true power.

00:09:16.278 --> 00:09:20.019
Hyunckel: I'm no longer
worthy to call Avan, "Master."

00:09:20.053 --> 00:09:23.627
So I can't claim
to avenge my master.

00:09:25.296 --> 00:09:28.604
For taking the life of my
father, Bartos the knight,

00:09:28.638 --> 00:09:31.008
I cannot allow you
to live any longer!

00:09:31.041 --> 00:09:33.814
You snotty whelp.
Watch your tongue.

00:09:33.847 --> 00:09:39.792
Like father, like son,
you both defy me. Begone!

00:09:47.809 --> 00:09:50.514
Hadlar: Impossible!
My Kaboom spell?!

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:51.616
Have you forgotten?

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.954
My armor will repel
any magical attack

00:09:53.987 --> 00:09:55.958
that you could
possibly conjure.

00:09:55.991 --> 00:09:59.030
Prepare yourself... Hadlar!

00:10:03.373 --> 00:10:04.374
Die!

00:10:14.428 --> 00:10:18.871
There's nothing in this world
my Hell Claws cannot penetrate!

00:10:18.904 --> 00:10:22.010
Very good.
That's more like it.

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:26.620
-Popp: Dai!
-Dai: Popp! Maam!

00:10:26.654 --> 00:10:28.624
[relieved laughter]

00:10:28.657 --> 00:10:30.995
It was Hyunckel.
He showed up and saved us!

00:10:31.028 --> 00:10:34.067
Yeah - talk about
an oasis in a desert.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.003
That's great!

00:10:35.036 --> 00:10:38.176
So Hyunckel's a Disciple
of Avan after all.

00:10:38.209 --> 00:10:41.348
I'm sure that
Master Avan would be proud.

00:10:43.587 --> 00:10:45.958
We should get going.
Leona needs us!

00:10:45.991 --> 00:10:46.759
Right!

00:10:48.062 --> 00:10:50.801
Maam [thought]:
Be careful, Hyunckel.

00:10:56.779 --> 00:10:57.948
Who's winning?

00:10:57.982 --> 00:11:01.689
Ah, Lord Hadlar seems
to be at a disadvantage!

00:11:06.298 --> 00:11:08.804
Hyunckel [thought]: He's not
the Dark Commander for nothing.

00:11:08.837 --> 00:11:10.306
He has the power to back it!

00:11:10.339 --> 00:11:12.745
Hadlar [thought]: He's
stronger than I imagined!

00:11:12.779 --> 00:11:15.149
No wonder the
Dark King likes him!

00:11:15.183 --> 00:11:18.322
And without my spells,
I'm at a disadvantage!

00:11:18.355 --> 00:11:21.963
If I could do something
about that armor...

00:11:25.303 --> 00:11:27.741
Hadlar [thought]: I see...

00:11:27.775 --> 00:11:29.912
Hyunckel: He's coming
for the final showdown!

00:11:31.516 --> 00:11:33.385
Bloody Scryde!

00:11:38.362 --> 00:11:41.703
[pained groan]

00:11:41.736 --> 00:11:44.509
That was a
disappointing fight.

00:11:44.542 --> 00:11:46.613
It's over, Hadlar.

00:11:46.647 --> 00:11:47.748
Demon: No!

00:11:47.781 --> 00:11:49.451
Demon: He lost?!

00:11:59.371 --> 00:12:00.741
It can't be!

00:12:00.774 --> 00:12:03.379
No one could survive
an attack like that!

00:12:03.412 --> 00:12:07.855
Unlike you, I have a heart
on each side of my chest.

00:12:07.889 --> 00:12:10.994
Hadlar: I only needed
you to lower your blade!

00:12:11.362 --> 00:12:11.897
Now...

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:13.133
With your armor damaged,

00:12:13.166 --> 00:12:16.305
I'm going to fill
it with pure hellfire!

00:12:16.338 --> 00:12:19.512
Ready? Kafrizz!

00:12:20.213 --> 00:12:24.454
[pained screaming]

00:12:31.268 --> 00:12:32.403
Hyunckel...

00:12:47.502 --> 00:12:49.004
How do you like my flames?

00:12:49.037 --> 00:12:51.108
Are they not agonizing?

00:12:51.141 --> 00:12:54.849
They won't go out until
you're entirely consumed!

00:12:57.453 --> 00:12:59.826
Hyunckel: Curse you
and your dirty tricks!

00:12:59.859 --> 00:13:05.136
[straining grunts]

00:13:05.169 --> 00:13:08.543
Hyunckel [thought]:
I can't move my body!

00:13:08.577 --> 00:13:11.115
So much for your
mighty sword, then.

00:13:11.148 --> 00:13:15.958
While I... I still
have my secret weapon!

00:13:15.991 --> 00:13:17.829
Hadlar: Now watch as I unleash

00:13:17.862 --> 00:13:21.235
the full power of
my greatest spell!

00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:25.511
Can your punctured
armor withstand it?

00:13:25.544 --> 00:13:29.150
Now, take this! Kasizz!

00:13:33.359 --> 00:13:38.469
[cackling]

00:13:45.818 --> 00:13:47.487
Hadlar: I've won!

00:13:47.521 --> 00:13:52.030
You stubborn little brat.
He's finally met his end!

00:13:52.063 --> 00:13:53.534
[victorious laugh]

00:13:53.567 --> 00:13:54.602
Gargoyle: He has won!

00:13:54.636 --> 00:13:56.573
Lord Hadlar, are you hurt?

00:13:56.606 --> 00:14:00.246
Hadlar: It's nothing.
I merely lost one of my hearts.

00:14:01.583 --> 00:14:03.687
So, is this
all that survived?

00:14:03.721 --> 00:14:04.623
Yes.

00:14:04.656 --> 00:14:05.991
Fine!

00:14:06.024 --> 00:14:08.830
We're going after Dai and
we will slaughter them all!

00:14:08.863 --> 00:14:10.266
All: Yes, Lord!

00:14:13.272 --> 00:14:17.113
Hyunckel [thought]: No! Dai
and the others are in danger.

00:14:17.146 --> 00:14:22.257
I have to stop them, but I
don't have any way to fight!

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:26.933
What can I do?
What weapon can I use?!

00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:28.435
Avan: Life itself.

00:14:28.469 --> 00:14:30.072
[astonished breath]

00:14:30.106 --> 00:14:31.576
Hyunckel [thought]: Avan?!

00:14:31.609 --> 00:14:33.245
Avan: Life energy.

00:14:33.278 --> 00:14:36.418
Basically...
It's your Aura.

00:14:42.364 --> 00:14:43.600
How did you do that?

00:14:45.103 --> 00:14:47.407
I just focused
my whole Aura.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.915
As a Warrior, you
cannot cast most spells.

00:14:50.948 --> 00:14:53.118
If your sword is ever lost,

00:14:53.152 --> 00:14:57.093
the only weapon you're going
to have left is life itself.

00:14:58.129 --> 00:15:00.768
Avan: If you find yourself
in such a situation,

00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:03.072
you'll have to
fight with your Aura.

00:15:03.105 --> 00:15:04.441
Young Hyunckel: Aura...

00:15:04.474 --> 00:15:08.182
But remember that the Aura
is an offensive life energy,

00:15:08.215 --> 00:15:10.854
and it'll be very
difficult to control it.

00:15:10.888 --> 00:15:14.796
If your heart is full of malice
it can put your own life at risk

00:15:14.829 --> 00:15:17.366
the same way it does
with your opponents.

00:15:19.137 --> 00:15:21.943
I don't need
that kind of skill.

00:15:21.976 --> 00:15:24.949
All I have to do is defeat
my enemy with my sword,

00:15:24.982 --> 00:15:26.418
isn't that right?

00:15:29.826 --> 00:15:33.398
Hyunckel [thought]: Back then,
I laughed at Avan's teachings.

00:15:33.432 --> 00:15:39.912
But now, I understand.
Now I know why he taught me.

00:15:39.946 --> 00:15:42.083
It's almost
impressive how stubborn

00:15:42.116 --> 00:15:44.656
the Students
of Avan can be.

00:15:44.689 --> 00:15:46.526
Wait a minute, Lord Hadlar.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.130
We can take him in
his weakened state!

00:15:54.942 --> 00:15:56.979
Hadlar [thought]:
Has he given up?

00:16:02.423 --> 00:16:03.627
What is that?

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:07.334
An extreme amount of energy
is gathering at his forehead!

00:16:07.367 --> 00:16:11.174
Wait, is this...
his Aura?!

00:16:11.208 --> 00:16:13.947
Hyunckel: If it means
stopping Hadlar here,

00:16:13.981 --> 00:16:17.387
then I'll gladly
use all of my life!

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.357
Avan, my master!

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:23.232
Give this ungrateful
student his final strength!

00:16:23.967 --> 00:16:26.773
N-No. Get away!

00:16:26.806 --> 00:16:30.413
Hyunckel: Grand Cross!

00:16:30.446 --> 00:16:35.724
[screaming]

00:16:38.229 --> 00:16:40.667
Dai, is that light...

00:16:42.505 --> 00:16:44.007
Maam: What? What is it?!

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:48.115
It looks just like...
I remember...

00:16:48.148 --> 00:16:49.919
Popp: The light
from when Master Avan

00:16:49.953 --> 00:16:53.158
fought Hadlar and
sacrificed himself!

00:16:56.398 --> 00:16:57.601
Avan: Megante!

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:08.790
Popp: It was just like that.

00:17:08.824 --> 00:17:12.798
Like the final flash...
of existence as you know it.

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:14.500
Oh, no...

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:17.908
Popp: Hey!

00:17:17.942 --> 00:17:19.444
Where do you think
you're going, Dai?!

00:17:19.477 --> 00:17:22.250
Dai: To go help Hyunckel.
Where do you think?!

00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:23.920
Hold on!

00:17:23.954 --> 00:17:26.860
We don't even know for sure
whether that was him or not!

00:17:26.893 --> 00:17:29.565
Besides, he can't
use any spells...

00:17:29.599 --> 00:17:33.005
He wouldn't be able to
cast Megante like Avan!

00:17:33.038 --> 00:17:35.209
But Popp - that was no
ordinary light.

00:17:35.243 --> 00:17:37.447
Him or not,
he's still in trouble.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.120
He needs help.
Isn't that right, Maam?!

00:17:40.153 --> 00:17:41.756
What are you thinking?!

00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:43.526
What about Princess Leona?!

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.429
Dai: There's still
time until sundown.

00:17:45.463 --> 00:17:48.369
Popp: Stop it! There's
nothing you can do now!

00:17:48.402 --> 00:17:50.975
Dai: No. At the very
least, I have to go!

00:17:51.008 --> 00:17:53.245
Maam: You can't, Dai.

00:17:53.278 --> 00:17:55.984
We're going to Valge Tower,
no matter what.

00:17:56.018 --> 00:17:57.320
You know we have to.

00:17:57.353 --> 00:18:00.661
Why? Are you abandoning him?

00:18:00.694 --> 00:18:03.131
No, it's what he would want.

00:18:04.334 --> 00:18:05.737
Hyunckel and Crocodine...

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:09.077
they came here to help us
finish the job, didn't they?

00:18:09.111 --> 00:18:11.481
They're buying us time
so that you can rescue

00:18:11.515 --> 00:18:13.619
Princess Leona from Flazzard!

00:18:14.487 --> 00:18:16.225
Maam: If you turn back now,

00:18:16.258 --> 00:18:19.364
everything they've done
will be for nothing.

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:25.877
Besides, Hyunckel's
a Disciple of Avan.

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.082
He'd try to save his friends,

00:18:28.115 --> 00:18:30.920
even if it cost
him everything...

00:18:30.954 --> 00:18:34.127
Just as our
Master once did for you.

00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:39.138
Popp [thought]: They're
strong... They're so strong,

00:18:39.171 --> 00:18:40.807
both Hyunckel and Maam.

00:18:40.841 --> 00:18:43.012
How could I compete?

00:18:43.045 --> 00:18:44.648
All right then, Maam.

00:18:44.682 --> 00:18:46.552
Right now, the only
mission we have is

00:18:46.585 --> 00:18:50.159
to save Leona as
quickly as we can.

00:18:50.192 --> 00:18:52.931
Let's go.
The tower's right there!

00:18:54.836 --> 00:18:58.175
Dai [thought]: Hyunckel,
Crocodine; thank you.

00:18:58.209 --> 00:19:00.412
I promise I'll save Leona.

00:19:00.446 --> 00:19:03.786
So please, please
just keep fighting!

00:19:12.504 --> 00:19:14.642
Hadlar: So I
withstood it...

00:19:14.675 --> 00:19:17.748
Lucky that I had these
minions as a shield.

00:19:23.693 --> 00:19:27.702
Is this the might of
that Grand Cross attack?

00:19:27.735 --> 00:19:30.272
What a terrifying power.

00:19:35.851 --> 00:19:37.286
Hadlar: Hyunckel.

00:19:45.102 --> 00:19:46.338
I see.

00:19:46.372 --> 00:19:47.641
[delighted laughter]

00:19:47.674 --> 00:19:48.877
I get it now.

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:52.518
Looks like his Grand Cross
was an incomplete attack!

00:19:52.551 --> 00:19:57.895
Hadlar: As a result, it drew
upon all the Aura Hyunckel had!

00:19:57.928 --> 00:19:59.096
What a pity,

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:03.238
and now all that remains is
this soulless husk of a man.

00:20:03.272 --> 00:20:05.008
Hadlar: [chuckling]

00:20:05.042 --> 00:20:07.982
So... even after
all your sacrifice,

00:20:08.015 --> 00:20:11.856
it looks like I still get
the last laugh, Hyunckel!

00:20:13.458 --> 00:20:16.231
Once I finally finish
you off for good...

00:20:16.264 --> 00:20:18.402
defeat that boy,
Dai, and his friends,

00:20:18.436 --> 00:20:19.772
then there'll
be no one left

00:20:19.806 --> 00:20:23.478
in the entire world
who could stop me!

00:20:23.513 --> 00:20:26.786
Hadlar: You can live with
your regrets in the afterlife.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.458
Along with Avan... Bartos,

00:20:29.491 --> 00:20:32.798
and the rest that
will be with you soon!

00:20:34.267 --> 00:20:37.607
Hyunckel: Avan...
Bartos...

00:20:39.645 --> 00:20:43.385
Young Hyunckel:
Master! Dad!

00:20:52.704 --> 00:20:55.777
This is it!
Farewell, Hyunckel!

00:21:01.054 --> 00:21:02.924
Im...possible!

00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:04.127
Hadlar [thought]:
But he had

00:21:04.161 --> 00:21:06.364
completely spent
all of his Aura!

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.684
Hadlar [thought]:
Even unconscious,

00:21:15.717 --> 00:21:19.992
he still retains the last
of his will to fight!

00:21:20.026 --> 00:21:22.129
Well done, Hyunckel.

00:21:22.162 --> 00:21:26.639
Hadlar [thought]: You are
indeed, a true... Warrior...

00:21:42.436 --> 00:21:45.409
Flazzard: Master Hadlar
sure is useless!

00:21:45.443 --> 00:21:49.050
He couldn't even beat
a few little brats...

00:21:49.084 --> 00:21:50.486
Flazzard: Oh, well.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.893
I guess this means Dai's head
will be even more valuable!

00:21:53.927 --> 00:21:57.133
The combined dark army couldn't
beat the boy and his friends...

00:21:57.166 --> 00:22:03.078
So if I obliterate them,
all the glory will be for me!

00:23:37.935 --> 00:23:39.972
Narrator: Saved by
Hyunckel and Crocodine,

00:23:40.005 --> 00:23:43.478
Dai's party reaches
Valge Tower at last.

00:23:43.513 --> 00:23:45.382
But once again they
find themselves

00:23:45.415 --> 00:23:48.154
at the mercy of
Flazzard's powerful attack.

00:23:49.357 --> 00:23:51.294
When all hope seems lost,

00:23:51.328 --> 00:23:56.304
will Dai remember the words of
Master Avan and save the day?

00:23:56.337 --> 00:23:57.808
