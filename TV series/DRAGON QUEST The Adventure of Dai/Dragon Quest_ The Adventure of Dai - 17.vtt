WEBVTT

00:01:54.697 --> 00:01:57.334
Flazzard: [furious snarl]

00:01:57.903 --> 00:02:01.209
[frustrated grunts]

00:02:01.242 --> 00:02:02.478
[furious roar]

00:02:02.512 --> 00:02:03.881
Curses!

00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:06.754
Flazzard: Why?
Why the blazes?!

00:02:06.787 --> 00:02:10.226
I'm the one with the plan
that lured the Hero here.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.968
Now I'm supposed to just
sit and guard the hostage?!

00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:16.039
Flazzard: How about
we break the ice?!

00:02:16.072 --> 00:02:18.176
Huh, little Princess?!

00:02:26.425 --> 00:02:29.031
I... guess I can
hold off, for now.

00:02:29.064 --> 00:02:31.903
You've only got until
sundown, anyway.

00:02:48.871 --> 00:02:51.442
[devious laughter]

00:02:51.476 --> 00:02:54.281
It looks like there are
guards here, after all.

00:02:54.314 --> 00:02:55.952
Let's get them!

00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:57.121
We need a plan!

00:02:57.154 --> 00:02:59.560
Oh, no! It's the Hero!

00:02:59.593 --> 00:03:03.266
Avan Style Sword
Technique, Wave Slash!

00:03:03.768 --> 00:03:04.268
Run!

00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:05.805
[fleeing cries]

00:03:05.838 --> 00:03:07.174
Baduck - let's do it!

00:03:07.207 --> 00:03:08.342
Right.

00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:11.550
Baduck: 'kay. Let's
give this thing a shot!

00:03:11.583 --> 00:03:13.287
Dai: If we take
out this one

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.124
while Popp destroys
the Dark Ice Spire,

00:03:15.157 --> 00:03:17.762
Flazzard's Curse Field
should disappear.

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:21.771
Dai [thought]: And then
I can save you, Leona!

00:03:21.804 --> 00:03:23.807
Here we go!

00:03:24.543 --> 00:03:25.310
Look out!

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.068
Dai: The Spire...
It's still standing.

00:03:37.101 --> 00:03:39.873
Who did that?! Come out!

00:03:39.906 --> 00:03:41.275
[worried chirp]

00:03:46.252 --> 00:03:48.489
Whoa! Where did
they come from?

00:03:54.335 --> 00:03:55.370
Baduck: We're surrounded!

00:03:55.404 --> 00:03:57.374
Dai: These are not
Flazzard's soldiers.

00:03:57.407 --> 00:03:58.845
Was this a trap?!

00:03:58.878 --> 00:04:02.618
Zaboera: [delighted cackle]

00:04:03.687 --> 00:04:04.789
Dai: Who are you?!

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.362
[chuckling]

00:04:08.396 --> 00:04:12.506
I am the Commander of
the Mystic Legion; Zaboera!

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:16.379
And this is Mystvearn;
Commander of the Shadow Legion.

00:04:16.412 --> 00:04:17.783
Mystic Legion?!

00:04:17.816 --> 00:04:19.218
And the Shadow Legion?!

00:04:19.252 --> 00:04:23.159
We knew you and your party would
split up to destroy the Spires-

00:04:23.192 --> 00:04:25.364
and it seems we were correct.

00:04:25.397 --> 00:04:27.836
And now we have the
perfect opportunity

00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:31.476
to wipe out you pesky gnats,
once and for all.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.915
Then... Popp and Maam...

00:04:33.948 --> 00:04:37.655
[devious laughter]

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:39.926
Popp: Looks like we've
stumbled into a trap.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.497
This isn't good. Do you
think Dai and Baduck...

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:45.805
We have to focus on the
mission at hand, right?

00:04:45.838 --> 00:04:47.174
We gotta defeat-

00:04:47.207 --> 00:04:48.778
[amused chuckle]

00:04:48.811 --> 00:04:52.050
Hadlar: So Dai is at
the Dark Flame Spire.

00:04:52.084 --> 00:04:54.321
Hadlar: How disappointing.

00:04:57.696 --> 00:04:58.997
It's him.

00:05:02.104 --> 00:05:03.740
Popp: It can't be...

00:05:04.475 --> 00:05:06.914
Then, so be it. Either way,

00:05:06.947 --> 00:05:09.987
this is the end for
the Disciples of Avan.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.961
I suppose I'll just
enjoy crushing you worms.

00:05:13.995 --> 00:05:15.632
Uh, Popp?

00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:19.405
That voice...
That voice is one that...

00:05:19.438 --> 00:05:21.610
I'll never forget!

00:05:29.425 --> 00:05:32.364
Popp: Hadlar,
the Dark Commander!

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:34.636
Zaboera: Not even a Hero

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.876
can handle this
many enemies at once.

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:40.247
Whether you fear
the Dark Army or not,

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.350
you will lose tonight.

00:05:47.094 --> 00:05:48.429
Baduck: Very well.

00:05:48.462 --> 00:05:50.901
And once again - it's time
for Baduck the swordsman...

00:05:50.935 --> 00:05:53.540
To use the Papnica
Single-Blade style!

00:05:58.951 --> 00:05:59.986
[shocked yell]

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:03.994
Hey - Baduck; you focus
on fighting off the Mages!

00:06:04.028 --> 00:06:08.203
They're weak if you don't give
them a chance to use a spell!

00:06:08.236 --> 00:06:09.772
Right! I'm on it!

00:06:14.716 --> 00:06:15.651
So, he...

00:06:15.684 --> 00:06:18.758
He's the one who
took Master Avan?

00:06:18.791 --> 00:06:19.425
He did.

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:20.695
But I did not expect

00:06:20.728 --> 00:06:24.167
the Dark Commander himself
to show his ugly mug.

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:26.406
[amused laugh]

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:28.309
I thought I should
personally come and see

00:06:28.343 --> 00:06:31.181
you annoying humans
defeated at last.

00:06:31.215 --> 00:06:32.652
O-Oh yeah?

00:06:32.686 --> 00:06:36.726
Don't assume everything's just
going to go as planned, Hadlar!

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.465
You're that little Mage
who was there that day

00:06:39.498 --> 00:06:41.804
when I defeated the Hero Avan.

00:06:41.837 --> 00:06:44.676
That's right!
I'm one of his students!

00:06:45.443 --> 00:06:51.322
[chuckling]

00:06:51.355 --> 00:06:53.159
W-What's so funny?

00:06:53.193 --> 00:06:54.930
[laughing]

00:06:54.963 --> 00:06:59.639
How hilarious.
No, how very pathetic!

00:06:59.673 --> 00:07:02.712
The scrawny little
student desperately fought

00:07:02.746 --> 00:07:07.021
all this way to avenge
his precious master...

00:07:07.054 --> 00:07:08.223
[chuckling]

00:07:08.256 --> 00:07:13.099
Only to end up on this island,
facing a pitiful end!

00:07:13.132 --> 00:07:14.435
Well... I might lose,

00:07:14.468 --> 00:07:16.941
but I'm not going down
this time without a fight!

00:07:16.974 --> 00:07:20.247
And after what you
did to our Master Avan?

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.484
You're going to pay for it!

00:07:22.518 --> 00:07:24.756
That's right.
So mark my words;

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:29.365
You will never... be
forgiven... for what you did!

00:07:29.398 --> 00:07:30.901
And who are you?

00:07:30.935 --> 00:07:33.073
Maam: I'm a student
of Avan, too.

00:07:33.106 --> 00:07:34.308
A Disciple!

00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:38.917
It seems as if you have the
wrong idea about me, disciple.

00:07:38.951 --> 00:07:42.725
I'm not really the one
that took Avan's life...

00:07:43.426 --> 00:07:44.796
Kindness!

00:07:44.829 --> 00:07:48.670
That animal instinct
"kindness" was his undoing!

00:07:51.009 --> 00:07:52.144
Why, you-

00:07:52.177 --> 00:07:53.279
Wait, don't!

00:07:53.312 --> 00:07:56.619
[charging roar]

00:07:58.858 --> 00:07:59.626
Maam, no!

00:07:59.659 --> 00:08:01.796
He's powerful in
hand-to-hand, too!

00:08:08.042 --> 00:08:09.679
[pained groan]

00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:11.716
Maam!

00:08:13.286 --> 00:08:14.287
Die.

00:08:16.492 --> 00:08:17.728
[roaring]

00:08:25.077 --> 00:08:27.615
Dai [thought]: There's
just too many of them.

00:08:27.648 --> 00:08:29.485
In that case...

00:08:29.519 --> 00:08:31.890
[battle cry]

00:08:31.923 --> 00:08:33.760
Dai: Avan...

00:08:39.304 --> 00:08:40.541
Baduck: Dai!

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.857
Dai [thought]: H-He floats like
a ghost... but he's so strong!

00:08:49.425 --> 00:08:51.328
Who is he?!

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.677
Dai: This... This is...

00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:00.948
Dark Puppetry Aura Hand?!

00:09:03.954 --> 00:09:08.096
B-but... I thought that was
Hyunckel's unique skill?!

00:09:08.129 --> 00:09:09.265
Zaboera: [chuckle]

00:09:09.298 --> 00:09:11.101
You hopeless fool.

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:15.076
Hyunckel may have learned
his sword skills from Avan,

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.648
but he learned how to
manipulate the Dark Aura

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:20.053
from Commander
Mystvearn, here.

00:09:20.087 --> 00:09:23.125
How else would he bend
the will of the dead?

00:09:23.159 --> 00:09:28.269
But the fact is, Mystvearn is
the originator of that skill.

00:09:29.872 --> 00:09:31.910
Dai [thought]:
I... I can't move!

00:09:32.846 --> 00:09:33.446
Dai!

00:09:33.479 --> 00:09:34.683
Zaboera: Whoops!

00:09:34.716 --> 00:09:38.891
You aren't going anywhere,
you weak, old goat.

00:09:38.924 --> 00:09:42.130
I won't stand by and
let some ancient gremlin

00:09:42.164 --> 00:09:43.466
call me an old goat!

00:09:43.499 --> 00:09:45.103
Hah! What a pain it is

00:09:45.136 --> 00:09:48.577
having to deal with
fossils like you, swordsman.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:53.085
Let the words of the dead
carry you to eternity.

00:09:53.118 --> 00:09:54.655
Zaboera: Thwack!

00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:01.603
[nervous groan]

00:10:01.636 --> 00:10:05.009
W-What is this
creepy voice I hear?!

00:10:05.042 --> 00:10:08.717
It is the dead beckoning to
you from the netherworld.

00:10:08.751 --> 00:10:13.392
When you finally succumb
to them, your life ends!

00:10:16.065 --> 00:10:18.436
Now die, old man!

00:10:18.469 --> 00:10:20.306
[evil cackle]

00:10:52.972 --> 00:10:53.841
Popp...

00:10:53.874 --> 00:10:56.145
Ow... Hadlar's spell...

00:10:56.178 --> 00:10:58.950
It's even more powerful
than last time...

00:10:58.984 --> 00:11:00.019
But how?!

00:11:00.521 --> 00:11:01.856
Isn't it obvious?

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.796
As a reward for
defeating Avan,

00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:07.467
The Dark King granted
me a new body,

00:11:07.502 --> 00:11:10.006
allowing me an
even greater power!

00:11:10.039 --> 00:11:13.947
In close combat, spells,
and everything else!

00:11:16.686 --> 00:11:18.322
So now, I have more strength

00:11:18.355 --> 00:11:21.829
than when I defeated
the pathetic Hero, Avan.

00:11:22.565 --> 00:11:24.669
No, no...

00:11:24.703 --> 00:11:27.708
So now you should see
that this time around,

00:11:27.741 --> 00:11:30.848
you have no hope for victory.

00:11:30.881 --> 00:11:32.484
And your friend, Dai...

00:11:32.518 --> 00:11:36.492
has already been pummeled by
the Mystic and Shadow Legions,

00:11:36.527 --> 00:11:38.830
and is already gone.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.405
[evil laughter]

00:11:43.439 --> 00:11:45.010
Popp [thought]:
It's no good.

00:11:45.043 --> 00:11:49.117
We can't...
We can't beat him!

00:11:49.151 --> 00:11:51.255
Maybe if it was
just Flazzard.

00:11:51.288 --> 00:11:54.127
But with Hadlar and
the other Legions here...

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.700
It's all over.

00:11:56.734 --> 00:11:58.269
And now, it's time!

00:11:58.302 --> 00:12:01.108
For the crime of
resisting our Dark Army,

00:12:01.142 --> 00:12:04.114
the punishment will
have to be severe.

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:07.087
Popp [thought]: Sizzle?

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:12.798
Hadlar: You will learn your
lesson in my fearsome inferno!

00:12:22.417 --> 00:12:23.753
Popp: Maam!

00:12:24.589 --> 00:12:25.624
Popp [thought]:
That's right...

00:12:25.658 --> 00:12:29.966
I... I can't just give up!

00:12:31.168 --> 00:12:36.111
If I give up, then who's
going to protect her?!

00:12:37.916 --> 00:12:40.086
You're both going to burn!

00:12:41.322 --> 00:12:45.430
Popp [thought]: I have
to protect Maam...

00:12:45.463 --> 00:12:48.035
And I have to help Dai!

00:12:49.104 --> 00:12:51.409
Sizzle!

00:12:51.442 --> 00:12:53.514
Popp: I can't give up...

00:12:53.547 --> 00:12:55.884
Not until the very end.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.088
Here goes!

00:13:04.602 --> 00:13:05.804
What? No!

00:13:11.683 --> 00:13:14.020
I just cast... Sizzle?

00:13:17.561 --> 00:13:19.532
I-It can't be!

00:13:25.476 --> 00:13:26.580
Impossible!

00:13:26.613 --> 00:13:30.588
How could that weakling
mage's spell overpower my own?

00:13:30.621 --> 00:13:32.992
Are you all right,
Lord Hadlar?

00:13:33.025 --> 00:13:35.196
Silence, you fool.

00:13:36.833 --> 00:13:39.337
Now's my chance.
While they're distracted.

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:40.540
What can I use?

00:13:40.574 --> 00:13:41.576
Anything?!

00:13:41.609 --> 00:13:43.045
Curse you, boy!

00:13:43.079 --> 00:13:44.381
We'll take him out!

00:13:44.414 --> 00:13:46.619
All of you - back off!

00:13:51.095 --> 00:13:52.163
Sizzle!

00:14:02.718 --> 00:14:06.091
Popp: I did it!
Maam, did you see that?

00:14:07.528 --> 00:14:09.264
Maam: It was amazing.

00:14:09.297 --> 00:14:12.237
I can't believe you
really... cast Sizzle.

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:15.911
Right? Me too.
I wasn't even thinking.

00:14:15.944 --> 00:14:18.048
It's all thanks to my mentor!

00:14:18.082 --> 00:14:20.286
It was just one day of
training with Matoriv,

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.023
but it feels
like my attack spells

00:14:22.056 --> 00:14:24.929
have already
increased in power!

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:27.901
Popp: Thank you, Mentor!

00:14:30.473 --> 00:14:32.978
Popp: We can deal with
the Dark Ice Spire later.

00:14:33.011 --> 00:14:34.916
Let's go help Dai and Baduck.

00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:36.251
Maam: Yeah.

00:14:50.881 --> 00:14:53.019
Hadlar: What a surprise.

00:14:53.052 --> 00:14:57.528
Amazing how that
insolent human has grown.

00:15:10.352 --> 00:15:13.593
But now, observe
and understand...

00:15:13.627 --> 00:15:17.500
there is always going
to be a bigger force.

00:15:18.503 --> 00:15:19.906
Popp: No way! That's...

00:15:19.939 --> 00:15:23.646
Hadlar: Oh... You
recognize this spell?

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.519
You've done your
Mage homework.

00:15:26.552 --> 00:15:28.422
C'mon. Maam, run!

00:15:29.291 --> 00:15:31.428
Kasizz!

00:15:41.849 --> 00:15:43.887
Wh-What's that?

00:15:43.921 --> 00:15:45.022
Zaboera: [chuckling]

00:15:45.056 --> 00:15:46.358
Isn't it something?

00:15:46.392 --> 00:15:48.195
That's the sound
of Lord Hadlar

00:15:48.228 --> 00:15:51.870
using his most
powerful spell; Kasizz.

00:15:51.903 --> 00:15:53.372
Hadlar's here?

00:15:53.405 --> 00:15:57.280
The Dark Ice Spire is being
guarded by Lord Hadlar himself,

00:15:57.313 --> 00:15:59.284
along with his
legion of minions.

00:15:59.317 --> 00:16:01.488
He's fighting Popp and Maam?!

00:16:02.592 --> 00:16:04.093
No!

00:16:06.967 --> 00:16:09.973
Zaboera: Futile!
Pure futility.

00:16:10.006 --> 00:16:11.175
No one can break free

00:16:11.208 --> 00:16:14.347
from Mystvearn's Dark
Puppetry Aura Hand!

00:16:14.381 --> 00:16:18.990
Now let's see which one of
you is going to perish first.

00:16:26.573 --> 00:16:27.541
Yes!

00:16:33.587 --> 00:16:34.387
Baduck...

00:16:35.991 --> 00:16:37.260
Gomechan!

00:16:41.503 --> 00:16:44.474
Zaboera: C-Curse your
useless struggle!

00:16:48.349 --> 00:16:52.156
You've merely prolonged
your inevitable doom!

00:16:54.963 --> 00:16:57.333
Baduck, Gomechan...

00:16:57.366 --> 00:17:00.006
I'm not sure if I have
enough strength left in me

00:17:00.039 --> 00:17:01.976
to defend the both
of you right now.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:03.847
I'm sorry, you guys.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.886
Fear not! We're
in this together.

00:17:06.919 --> 00:17:08.488
[agreeing chirps]

00:17:09.826 --> 00:17:12.296
All of you! Attack!

00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:14.400
Zaboera: [cackling]

00:17:23.586 --> 00:17:24.421
Who did that?!

00:17:24.454 --> 00:17:27.393
Who would dare go
against Zaboera?!

00:17:28.764 --> 00:17:29.765
Crocodine: I would!

00:17:33.506 --> 00:17:35.409
Im...possible!

00:17:41.054 --> 00:17:42.624
Dai: Crocodine!

00:17:45.598 --> 00:17:46.532
It's you?!

00:17:46.566 --> 00:17:49.204
First you disappear
without a trace...

00:17:49.237 --> 00:17:52.778
Zaboera: Then you show up
and drop a boulder on us?

00:17:52.811 --> 00:17:54.915
What is the meaning of this?!

00:17:54.948 --> 00:17:57.688
I'm helping the
Disciples of Avan.

00:17:57.721 --> 00:17:59.290
Wh-You what?!

00:17:59.323 --> 00:18:01.395
I couldn't just
stand by and watch

00:18:01.428 --> 00:18:04.769
your attempt at a
cowardly little ambush.

00:18:04.802 --> 00:18:06.204
You're mad.

00:18:06.973 --> 00:18:08.308
All of you!

00:18:08.341 --> 00:18:11.281
Ignore the others and take
care of this traitor first!

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.555
You're joking. Must be.

00:18:14.589 --> 00:18:17.126
Because no one
in the Dark Army...

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:23.673
Can defeat the Beast King!

00:18:26.178 --> 00:18:29.117
So - this big
thing's on our side?!

00:18:30.955 --> 00:18:31.722
Dai.

00:18:31.756 --> 00:18:33.025
You're really alive!

00:18:33.058 --> 00:18:33.893
[chuckling]

00:18:33.926 --> 00:18:35.130
As you can see!

00:18:35.163 --> 00:18:37.000
I'm here to help you!

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:38.236
That's right!

00:18:38.269 --> 00:18:39.973
Popp and Maam are in danger!

00:18:40.006 --> 00:18:40.874
It's Hadlar.

00:18:40.908 --> 00:18:42.243
Fear not.

00:18:42.277 --> 00:18:45.249
A mighty ally is headed
for the Dark Ice Spire.

00:18:45.283 --> 00:18:48.856
And he's even more
powerful than I am!

00:18:59.444 --> 00:19:03.520
Lord Hadlar, you're...
You're safe.

00:19:03.553 --> 00:19:05.222
Hadlar: Indeed.

00:19:11.234 --> 00:19:13.072
They still remain.

00:19:13.105 --> 00:19:14.474
I did hold back

00:19:14.508 --> 00:19:17.881
so I wouldn't damage
the Dark Ice Spire.

00:19:17.915 --> 00:19:19.552
Hadlar: She's
still breathing.

00:19:19.586 --> 00:19:23.059
I should finish her
off just in case.

00:19:23.092 --> 00:19:24.061
Popp: No...

00:19:24.094 --> 00:19:25.597
Wait...

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.471
Hadlar: You
survived, as well?

00:19:29.505 --> 00:19:34.380
Don't worry, you'll both meet
again in the next realm.

00:19:35.584 --> 00:19:36.553
Please...

00:19:36.586 --> 00:19:41.461
I don't... I don't
care what happens to me.

00:19:42.898 --> 00:19:48.810
Just... Just, please, let
her go. I'll take her place.

00:19:48.843 --> 00:19:52.685
There's that pointless
"kindness" again.

00:19:52.718 --> 00:19:56.357
Please... Not Maam...

00:19:57.628 --> 00:20:02.804
I see. You're in love
with this girl, aren't you?

00:20:02.838 --> 00:20:05.577
[laughing]

00:20:05.611 --> 00:20:07.681
Hadlar: Oh, this
is just perfect!

00:20:07.714 --> 00:20:08.917
Please, stop...

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:13.860
Hadlar: Knowing that, I can't
possibly let her live.

00:20:13.894 --> 00:20:18.703
You've scarred my body, you
weak, worthless little worm.

00:20:18.736 --> 00:20:21.509
So now I'm going
to make you watch

00:20:21.542 --> 00:20:26.151
while I take away
the girl you love.

00:20:26.185 --> 00:20:30.660
This is the most fitting
punishment for you, boy.

00:20:31.194 --> 00:20:32.797
No, don't...

00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:36.104
Hadlar: I'll leave her on
the top of the Dark Ice Spire,

00:20:36.138 --> 00:20:38.876
where everyone
will be able to see.

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:40.547
You can't!

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.083
[chuckling]

00:20:42.116 --> 00:20:44.020
Please, don't! Please!

00:20:45.991 --> 00:20:51.669
No! Maam!

00:21:06.231 --> 00:21:09.270
The Dark Ice Spire...
Destroyed?!

00:21:24.001 --> 00:21:26.037
What? But you're...

00:21:31.215 --> 00:21:32.517
The Dark Ice Spire.

00:21:32.551 --> 00:21:34.287
Well done, Hyunckel.

00:21:34.321 --> 00:21:35.923
So it really is him?

00:21:35.957 --> 00:21:39.363
Crocodine: Now, Dai, I'll
shatter the Dark Flame Spire.

00:21:39.397 --> 00:21:41.401
You go on ahead
to Valge Tower!

00:21:41.434 --> 00:21:42.436
Dai: Right!

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:46.645
Go on! Defeat
Flazzard, my friend!

00:21:46.679 --> 00:21:49.685
[roaring]

00:21:52.791 --> 00:21:57.801
Hyunckel... You're alive.
It can't be...

00:21:57.834 --> 00:21:59.705
Why, you little...

00:23:37.601 --> 00:23:39.905
Narrator: After vanishing
at the Underground Place,

00:23:39.939 --> 00:23:42.142
Hyunckel the Undead
Legion Commander

00:23:42.176 --> 00:23:44.447
makes a surprising return.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.253
Soon he faces Hadlar's
wrath for betraying

00:23:47.286 --> 00:23:49.758
the Dark Army
and rescuing Maam.

00:23:49.792 --> 00:23:53.432
But Hyunckel intends to avenge
the death of his father Bartos,

00:23:53.465 --> 00:23:56.672
and an incredible
showdown begins at last.

00:23:56.706 --> 00:23:58.543
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:58.576 --> 00:24:01.214
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:01.248 --> 00:24:03.118
"Hyunckel Versus Hadlar".
