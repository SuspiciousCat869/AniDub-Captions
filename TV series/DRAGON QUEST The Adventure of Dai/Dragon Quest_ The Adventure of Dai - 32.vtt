WEBVTT

00:01:51.456 --> 00:01:53.861
[roaring]

00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:09.024
Crocodine; do you think you
have enough strength left

00:02:09.057 --> 00:02:10.929
to throw me all
the way up there?

00:02:10.962 --> 00:02:11.897
What?

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.299
Unless you can fly

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:16.039
I don't think you'll make much
of a difference, Hyunckel.

00:02:16.072 --> 00:02:17.341
I know that.

00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:19.379
Crocodine: Then why?

00:02:19.412 --> 00:02:21.449
The same reason as you.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.958
Tell me. What kind of
a man would watch someone

00:02:25.992 --> 00:02:29.231
risk his life like
that and do nothing?

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.469
Right.

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:42.390
Crocodine: Ready?

00:02:42.424 --> 00:02:45.296
Not yet. The timing
is everything.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.213
[pained grunt]

00:02:53.246 --> 00:02:54.683
It's all over!

00:02:54.717 --> 00:02:56.085
Do it now!

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:58.724
[roaring]

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.567
[battle cry]

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.336
You human filth!

00:03:09.846 --> 00:03:12.785
Baran: Your pitiful
attacks won't work.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:22.238
There, Dai - try
using that sword!

00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:24.075
It's not as
strong as Baran's,

00:03:24.108 --> 00:03:26.445
but it's still a
Legendary Dark Blade.

00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:32.959
How clever. But no one
can trick the great Baran.

00:03:42.211 --> 00:03:44.616
Crocodine: Hyunckel,
are you all right?

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.720
Merle: Hold on.
I'll heal you!

00:03:46.753 --> 00:03:49.325
Hyunckel [thought]:
Dai - finish it quickly.

00:03:49.358 --> 00:03:51.295
Not even the Dark Armor Blade

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.767
can endure your
power for long.

00:03:58.143 --> 00:04:00.147
Alright. This'll work.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.449
Baran: [chuckling]

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.477
I could feel it the moment
that our blades crossed.

00:04:15.511 --> 00:04:19.820
That weapon isn't nearly as
strong as my Demon Dragon Blade.

00:04:19.853 --> 00:04:22.525
Baran: I'll shatter
it in a single blow...

00:04:22.558 --> 00:04:26.365
using my ultimate
attack, Gigabreak.

00:04:27.802 --> 00:04:30.674
Dai: I don't think you
have the energy left for it.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.782
Dai: The spell you
just used was Zapple!

00:04:36.954 --> 00:04:37.722
That's it...

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.227
You don't have
enough Magic Power left

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.699
to cast anything else.

00:04:42.733 --> 00:04:47.508
And without that...
We're sure to win!

00:04:49.144 --> 00:04:50.380
Baran: Zapple...

00:04:53.788 --> 00:04:55.859
With all my power...

00:04:55.892 --> 00:04:58.096
Master Avan's attack...

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.601
Hyunckel's blade...

00:05:00.635 --> 00:05:03.641
Baran [thought]: All his
power is in that sword.

00:05:03.674 --> 00:05:05.410
Dai: Finally...

00:05:05.443 --> 00:05:08.283
with all my memories
that Popp restored...

00:05:08.316 --> 00:05:11.556
and the strength
that they give me.

00:05:14.162 --> 00:05:16.634
You won't stand a chance!

00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:17.869
Silence!

00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:20.073
[roaring]

00:06:14.583 --> 00:06:16.853
Merle: Why aren't
they using their swords?

00:06:16.887 --> 00:06:18.422
Hyunckel: Because
they both think that

00:06:18.456 --> 00:06:21.061
their next move
will be their last.

00:06:21.997 --> 00:06:23.266
And they're right.

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:26.673
Just one mistake and
it could all be over.

00:06:26.707 --> 00:06:28.844
Merle [thought]:
Good luck, Dai.

00:06:29.411 --> 00:06:31.516
And Popp, too.

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:34.455
Leona [thought]:
It's no good.

00:06:34.489 --> 00:06:37.327
He's not responding
to my Zing spell.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.231
At this rate...

00:06:39.264 --> 00:06:42.972
Oh, please...
Come back to us, Popp.

00:06:58.136 --> 00:07:01.309
So, uh, what...
happened to me?

00:07:01.342 --> 00:07:03.881
Did I really die back there?

00:07:03.914 --> 00:07:07.454
Well, obviously...
I did use Megante.

00:07:11.261 --> 00:07:13.132
But that means!

00:07:13.165 --> 00:07:14.736
Where's Baran?!

00:07:15.336 --> 00:07:16.640
He's not here...

00:07:16.673 --> 00:07:18.978
So, if this is the afterlife,

00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:22.218
did he go to a
different one or something?

00:07:22.251 --> 00:07:23.787
Gomechan: Popp... Popp!

00:07:25.423 --> 00:07:26.325
Who's there?

00:07:26.358 --> 00:07:27.728
Gomechan: It's me!

00:07:29.164 --> 00:07:30.166
Popp: Gomechan?!

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:31.436
Well, duh, Popp!

00:07:31.469 --> 00:07:32.572
Huh, what do you know?

00:07:32.606 --> 00:07:35.410
Gomechan's talking.

00:07:35.443 --> 00:07:38.149
I guess anything's
possible in this place.

00:07:39.418 --> 00:07:42.190
Wait, does that mean
you're dead as well?

00:07:42.223 --> 00:07:44.461
Gomechan: Popp,
don't go that way.

00:07:44.494 --> 00:07:46.800
You'll enter
the Land of the Dead

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:50.507
and there's no going back
once you've gone in there!

00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:54.047
Huh? Well, now
that you mention it,

00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:58.056
my feet keep moving and...
I can't stop them.

00:07:58.089 --> 00:07:59.726
Come on! Get a grip, dummy.

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:02.899
You're not going to just
give up and die, are you?

00:08:02.932 --> 00:08:06.673
We've already come all this
way together, haven't we?

00:08:06.707 --> 00:08:11.182
And if you do die, then
I don't know what I... I...

00:08:11.215 --> 00:08:14.087
Gomechan: [crying]

00:08:14.121 --> 00:08:18.797
Hey, I'm sorry, Gomechan,
but it is all over for me now.

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:23.574
Honestly, it's a miracle
I survived this long.

00:08:23.608 --> 00:08:26.813
My strength could
only take me so far.

00:08:27.949 --> 00:08:29.786
But, Popp... I...

00:08:35.632 --> 00:08:40.239
Stupid Popp. You weakling!

00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:44.882
W-What?!

00:09:05.456 --> 00:09:06.993
[pained yell]

00:09:07.628 --> 00:09:09.633
He fell for it.

00:09:09.666 --> 00:09:11.603
Gomechan: I hate you, Popp.

00:09:11.637 --> 00:09:15.343
You haven't even managed
to avenge Master Avan,

00:09:15.377 --> 00:09:17.414
and now you're
just giving up?

00:09:17.447 --> 00:09:19.451
You're pathetic.

00:09:19.484 --> 00:09:20.955
Why, you little...

00:09:20.989 --> 00:09:25.765
I'm not letting a crybaby like
you call me pathetic, alright?!

00:09:25.798 --> 00:09:29.071
You hear me? I tried
as hard as I could!

00:09:29.105 --> 00:09:30.273
You liar!

00:09:32.411 --> 00:09:33.914
Baran: You're
still a child...

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:37.153
You don't have my years
of experience in battle.

00:09:51.683 --> 00:09:53.386
Gomechan: Dai's out there.

00:09:53.419 --> 00:09:56.058
And he's all alone
in that fight!

00:10:05.444 --> 00:10:06.814
Gomechan: But you...

00:10:06.847 --> 00:10:08.750
you're abandoning him.

00:10:08.784 --> 00:10:11.990
It's pathetic.
You're a coward!

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.329
[pained yell]

00:10:27.755 --> 00:10:30.561
Popp: Watch your mouth,
you stupid Slime.

00:10:30.595 --> 00:10:31.428
Huh?

00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:39.680
Popp: I... I may be dead,
but I'll... I'll...

00:10:39.713 --> 00:10:41.349
Baran: This is the end.

00:10:41.382 --> 00:10:44.387
Fall to my Gigabreak!

00:10:44.421 --> 00:10:45.389
Popp: I...

00:10:48.496 --> 00:10:57.046
I will never...
abandon... Dai!

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:19.357
Baran [thought]: Impossible!
How did he cast a spell?!

00:11:26.305 --> 00:11:27.273
Dai: Now!

00:11:33.185 --> 00:11:38.128
Avan Strash!

00:11:43.741 --> 00:11:48.349
[roaring]

00:11:49.451 --> 00:11:55.731
[roaring]

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.813
[pained yell]

00:12:10.962 --> 00:12:13.132
It... It's a draw?!

00:12:38.483 --> 00:12:39.552
Dai!

00:12:43.593 --> 00:12:44.662
He's alive.

00:12:44.696 --> 00:12:45.397
Oh!

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:46.431
Dai...

00:12:51.141 --> 00:12:52.177
Thanks, Merle.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.312
Are you all right?

00:12:53.345 --> 00:12:57.487
Dai: Yeah, and it's all
thanks to you guys. I owe you.

00:13:00.828 --> 00:13:02.799
The blade disintegrated!

00:13:02.832 --> 00:13:05.236
It's blade and hilt
have been reduced to dust.

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.340
Even with it's
magical properties,

00:13:07.374 --> 00:13:09.812
it can never be restored.

00:13:09.845 --> 00:13:13.085
So the Dark
Blade... is no more.

00:13:13.486 --> 00:13:14.421
I'm sorry.

00:13:14.454 --> 00:13:17.695
Don't be sorry. Your
life is more valuable.

00:13:17.728 --> 00:13:19.899
Thanks, Hyunckel.

00:13:19.932 --> 00:13:21.803
Wait a second. Where's Popp?

00:13:21.837 --> 00:13:24.975
Don't worry. He should be
all right as well!

00:13:27.648 --> 00:13:29.084
No, he's...

00:13:29.117 --> 00:13:30.954
Leona?

00:13:30.987 --> 00:13:34.562
It's too late...
I can't raise him.

00:13:35.964 --> 00:13:39.137
That's impossible.
I mean, he just...

00:13:39.171 --> 00:13:42.512
It's true! He cast
a spell, didn't he?

00:13:42.545 --> 00:13:46.485
l really don't understand
why that happened...

00:13:46.519 --> 00:13:51.329
But still, my Zing spell
just wouldn't work on him.

00:13:51.362 --> 00:13:55.937
I'm sorry. I guess
I wasn't strong enough.

00:13:56.873 --> 00:14:02.317
N-No...
It can't... be true.

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:06.192
Dai: Please...
Please, open your eyes.

00:14:06.225 --> 00:14:07.662
Popp...

00:14:07.695 --> 00:14:09.565
Popp!

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.515
[shocked gasps]

00:14:36.352 --> 00:14:37.053
Baran?!

00:14:49.512 --> 00:14:51.181
Don't bother bluffing.

00:14:51.215 --> 00:14:54.889
I know for a fact that you don't
have a single ounce of strength

00:14:54.922 --> 00:14:57.226
in your body left to summon.

00:15:00.033 --> 00:15:02.136
Baran: I don't either.

00:15:08.215 --> 00:15:10.921
Baran [thought]: His heart
has definitely stopped.

00:15:10.954 --> 00:15:14.394
So, then... how?

00:15:14.428 --> 00:15:17.734
Did the emotional bond to his
comrades really cause something

00:15:17.768 --> 00:15:20.941
so powerful to
stir inside of him?

00:15:20.974 --> 00:15:23.713
Is such a miracle possible?

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.557
Baran [thought]: How ironic.

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:31.729
The power of Dragons,
magic of Darklings,

00:15:31.763 --> 00:15:33.967
and the heart of a human.

00:15:34.001 --> 00:15:37.541
Of all three gifts bestowed
upon a Dragon Knight,

00:15:37.575 --> 00:15:42.150
for the human heart - the one
I thought was worthless...

00:15:44.187 --> 00:15:48.128
For it to deal me
such a crushing blow...

00:16:00.755 --> 00:16:02.390
What are you doing?

00:16:13.345 --> 00:16:16.451
Baran: Dino, I have
nothing left to say.

00:16:16.484 --> 00:16:19.525
Follow the path that you
believe is the right one.

00:16:19.558 --> 00:16:24.535
However, this world won't
hold two Dragon Knights.

00:16:24.568 --> 00:16:29.845
Once my blade is restored
and my wounds have healed...

00:16:29.879 --> 00:16:32.016
then we shall settle this.

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:34.154
You'll return to
the Dark Army?

00:16:34.187 --> 00:16:37.861
No longer will I
fight for their cause.

00:16:37.895 --> 00:16:39.732
If you are able
to defeat me,

00:16:39.765 --> 00:16:43.305
go on and destroy them
for the sake of your kind.

00:16:43.338 --> 00:16:45.877
But if I defeat you instead...

00:16:45.911 --> 00:16:49.084
then I will wipe
out all of humanity!

00:16:49.117 --> 00:16:51.188
How can you still say that?!

00:16:51.221 --> 00:16:54.194
It's too late
to change my ways.

00:16:54.228 --> 00:16:56.700
I've lived too
long like this.

00:16:56.733 --> 00:16:59.203
You stubborn old man!

00:17:00.608 --> 00:17:02.544
Baran: Say what you will.

00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:17.406
Leona: [amazed breath]

00:17:17.908 --> 00:17:18.643
Popp...

00:17:19.612 --> 00:17:22.818
Leona: He has a pulse.
He's alive again!

00:17:24.655 --> 00:17:26.025
But how?

00:17:26.058 --> 00:17:28.462
Baran: The boy is
tougher than he looks.

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:32.036
D-Did you...

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.074
Baran: This is the
first and last time

00:17:34.107 --> 00:17:36.612
I offer a gift to an enemy.

00:17:36.646 --> 00:17:40.521
When we meet again,
I won't hold back.

00:17:40.554 --> 00:17:43.459
Dino - no...

00:17:43.492 --> 00:17:44.762
Dai...

00:17:46.365 --> 00:17:48.536
Baran: You've been warned.

00:17:50.541 --> 00:17:54.047
Hyunckel [thought]: Baran has
reconnected to his human heart.

00:17:54.081 --> 00:17:57.888
That's why, to
atone for his sins,

00:17:57.921 --> 00:18:01.696
he wants his own
son to finish him.

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:08.408
He truly is tragically
powerful, but forever alone.

00:18:16.659 --> 00:18:20.533
Hadlar: It's the worst
possible outcome.

00:18:20.567 --> 00:18:26.244
Baran survived and Dai's powers
have become even stronger.

00:18:26.278 --> 00:18:29.686
At this rate,
I'll... I'll...

00:18:29.719 --> 00:18:31.789
Mystvearn: Commander Hadlar?

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.732
King Vearn summons you.

00:18:39.204 --> 00:18:42.844
Vearn: Hadlar,
raise your head.

00:18:44.147 --> 00:18:47.420
What's wrong? I said rise.

00:18:47.453 --> 00:18:50.193
Hadlar: I beg for
forgiveness, King Vearn.

00:18:50.226 --> 00:18:54.468
As his superior, Baran's
failure is my responsibility.

00:18:54.502 --> 00:18:56.839
When he returns,
I shall make sure to...

00:18:56.872 --> 00:18:59.277
Vearn: Enough.

00:18:59.311 --> 00:19:02.952
Vearn: Baran will
likely never return.

00:19:02.985 --> 00:19:04.855
Considering
his past behavior,

00:19:04.888 --> 00:19:09.397
I doubt he'll do anything
unless it involves the boy.

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:13.205
The real failure,
and your crime,

00:19:13.239 --> 00:19:19.117
was hiding Dai's Dragon
Knight lineage from even me!

00:19:19.151 --> 00:19:21.421
Killvearn: [smug chuckle]

00:19:21.454 --> 00:19:26.732
Vearn: This mess is the result
of your petty little games.

00:19:28.603 --> 00:19:32.076
Baran is the only
being in the world

00:19:32.109 --> 00:19:35.517
who has the power
to resist me.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:38.857
Convincing him to
become an ally of mine

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:43.199
was not an easy task, so...

00:19:43.232 --> 00:19:49.645
I'll say it once more.
Raise your head.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.591
Vearn: I am a tolerant man.

00:19:55.624 --> 00:20:00.867
I will forgive up
to three failures.

00:20:00.901 --> 00:20:05.711
Vearn: First... you've cost us
the Romos and Papnica Kingdoms,

00:20:05.744 --> 00:20:09.151
and allowed two of
our Legion Commanders

00:20:09.184 --> 00:20:12.389
to join the other side.

00:20:14.227 --> 00:20:16.966
Vearn: Then on Valge Island...

00:20:16.999 --> 00:20:23.479
despite leading an entire army,
you failed to kill the boy.

00:20:23.513 --> 00:20:24.682
Hadlar: [panicked breathing]

00:20:24.715 --> 00:20:28.923
Vearn: And now, this
incident with Baran...

00:20:35.169 --> 00:20:36.572
Vearn: However...

00:20:36.606 --> 00:20:42.751
I have not forgotten that it was
you who defeated the Hero, Avan.

00:20:44.153 --> 00:20:48.295
Hadlar, this is
your last chance.

00:20:48.328 --> 00:20:51.034
When you next
appear before me,

00:20:51.068 --> 00:20:56.912
if you still haven't wiped out
Dai and his bothersome allies,

00:20:56.946 --> 00:20:59.819
my patience will run out.

00:20:59.852 --> 00:21:03.024
Do you understand me?

00:21:05.329 --> 00:21:09.972
Y-Yes. I shall stake
my life upon it, my king!

00:21:10.006 --> 00:21:12.410
Vearn: Very well. Begone.

00:21:12.443 --> 00:21:13.980
Hadlar: Your Majesty.

00:21:21.929 --> 00:21:26.338
Killvearn: Shouldn't
we just kill him, sire?

00:21:26.371 --> 00:21:29.645
Vearn: I have given
him the ultimate body.

00:21:29.679 --> 00:21:33.953
If he cannot win, then
the weakness is in his mind.

00:21:33.987 --> 00:21:39.431
Driven to desperation, he may
actually prove his worth.

00:21:39.464 --> 00:21:42.704
We can kill him anytime.

00:21:42.738 --> 00:21:47.213
Killvearn: Amazing, King Vearn.
You've thought of everything.

00:21:47.246 --> 00:21:49.151
Pure genius, King Vearn.

00:21:49.184 --> 00:21:50.252
Vearn: So...

00:21:50.286 --> 00:21:52.691
Let us sit back and enjoy

00:21:52.724 --> 00:21:56.765
the final charge
of the Hadlar Legion.

00:23:38.368 --> 00:23:40.774
Narrator: Weary after
their latest battle,

00:23:40.807 --> 00:23:43.680
Dai and his friends
regroup at Merle's cabin,

00:23:43.713 --> 00:23:46.317
but the Dark Army
offers no rest.

00:23:46.351 --> 00:23:50.025
Hadlar is desperate not to waste
King Vearn's final chance,

00:23:50.059 --> 00:23:54.134
and enlists Zaboera's wiles to
plot destruction for our heroes,

00:23:54.167 --> 00:23:55.469
but will they succeed?

00:23:55.503 --> 00:23:56.973
Find out on
the next episode of

00:23:57.006 --> 00:23:59.878
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

"Zaboera's Scheme."
