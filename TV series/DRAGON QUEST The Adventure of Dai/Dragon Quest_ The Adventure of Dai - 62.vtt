WEBVTT

00:01:51.255 --> 00:01:53.260
Bowson: The Cave
of Trials was created

00:01:53.293 --> 00:01:54.964
by the God of Humanity.

00:01:54.997 --> 00:01:56.065
It's a mystical vault,

00:01:56.098 --> 00:01:58.069
containing every
spell and magical item

00:01:58.103 --> 00:02:01.408
used to battle
the forces of evil.

00:02:01.442 --> 00:02:04.315
Queen Flora had this fort
built above the cavern because

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:08.423
she believed we would eventually
need to use what lies within.

00:02:08.457 --> 00:02:11.062
So why is the cave of
a God full of monsters?

00:02:11.096 --> 00:02:14.836
Bowson: The King of Teran has
provided us with a book; this.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.909
It's a history of the region
that gives us some insight.

00:02:17.942 --> 00:02:19.646
It seems the gods did
not approve of

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:21.382
humans wielding
more power than they'd

00:02:21.416 --> 00:02:23.821
proven themselves
worthy of handling.

00:02:23.855 --> 00:02:26.627
We don't know how far
down the labyrinth goes,

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.797
but the deeper levels
are said to hold

00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:30.400
the more powerful spells.

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:33.574
Down there, the paths
become more complex,

00:02:33.608 --> 00:02:37.280
the traps are more dangerous,
and at the lowest levels,

00:02:37.314 --> 00:02:40.554
even more terrifying
creatures await.

00:02:40.588 --> 00:02:45.163
All to say, it's not a place
for the inexperienced.

00:02:45.197 --> 00:02:47.033
But... the only
way to bind with

00:02:47.067 --> 00:02:49.773
the Kaglimmer spell
is to brave it.

00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:51.544
Popp: Pretty wild.

00:02:51.577 --> 00:02:53.313
Who would have thought
that such a place

00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:55.585
would exist in Carl Kingdom?

00:02:55.618 --> 00:02:58.624
Ah-ha, here we go.
There's a page on the spell.

00:02:59.191 --> 00:03:00.594
"By casting in a group,

00:03:00.628 --> 00:03:03.634
users of the Kaglimmer
can multiply its power.

00:03:03.668 --> 00:03:05.104
For maximum effect,

00:03:05.137 --> 00:03:07.407
arrange Mysticite
crystals at five points

00:03:07.441 --> 00:03:09.713
around the circle of
enchantment."

00:03:09.746 --> 00:03:10.982
Well, then...

00:03:11.016 --> 00:03:14.455
I guess it's a good thing we've
got five Disciples of Avan, huh?

00:03:14.488 --> 00:03:17.227
I've got to say,
I don't like this plan.

00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:20.835
Leona's not a warrior -
she's, like, a normal girl.

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:24.408
And more importantly,
the princess of Papnica.

00:03:24.442 --> 00:03:27.381
She shouldn't have to
take such a big risk...

00:03:27.414 --> 00:03:29.251
Maybe somebody else could go.

00:03:29.284 --> 00:03:32.424
Enough. She is
perfectly capable.

00:03:32.458 --> 00:03:34.028
Do not dismiss her.

00:03:34.062 --> 00:03:35.464
Women can risk their lives

00:03:35.497 --> 00:03:38.002
to fight for what they
believe in, as well.

00:03:40.675 --> 00:03:45.350
But, Lady Amy... I don't think
Dai is trying to say otherwise.

00:03:45.383 --> 00:03:46.654
Lady Amy: Huh?

00:03:46.687 --> 00:03:49.325
If Leona becomes
a Disciple of Avan...

00:03:49.358 --> 00:03:51.429
that means she'll
have to face

00:03:51.462 --> 00:03:54.569
the Dark King's
terrifying powers up close.

00:03:55.605 --> 00:03:58.911
Yeah. Honestly, it is
kind of overwhelming.

00:03:58.944 --> 00:04:01.784
I really don't think any
of us would face him again

00:04:01.817 --> 00:04:03.387
if we had the choice.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.056
Lady Amy: Fair enough.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.194
I see where you're
coming from, Dai...

00:04:07.228 --> 00:04:10.534
But please; just try to
understand that this was

00:04:10.568 --> 00:04:14.007
the Princess's choice -
and it's her fight, as well.

00:04:14.041 --> 00:04:16.412
Maam: Right.
And not to mention...

00:04:16.445 --> 00:04:18.851
there's already a girl
who's fighting the Dark King,

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:21.990
and she's saved you
a bunch... Right, Dai?

00:04:22.024 --> 00:04:23.226
[giggling]

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:25.430
Well, maybe you're
the exception.

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:28.537
[excited chatter]

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:36.786
L-Leona.

00:04:41.062 --> 00:04:43.366
Popp [thought]: She's
supposed to fight in that?!

00:04:44.167 --> 00:04:47.174
This garment...
is a Robe of Carl.

00:04:47.207 --> 00:04:49.746
The fabric can repel Malice.

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:52.484
We'll require a
couple of guards.

00:04:53.186 --> 00:04:54.623
Merle: Wait, Your Majesty...

00:04:54.656 --> 00:04:56.860
Please, will you
take me with you?

00:04:56.894 --> 00:05:00.100
I'm no fighter, but my
clairvoyance could be useful

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.937
when navigating the labyrinth.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.245
And if I can help all of you,
I'll take my chances.

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:08.550
Please, let me try.

00:05:10.487 --> 00:05:13.260
Very well. You may
come along, Merle.

00:05:13.293 --> 00:05:15.230
Thank you, Queen Flora.

00:05:15.263 --> 00:05:17.001
Now, we still need one more.

00:05:17.034 --> 00:05:17.802
I can...

00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:19.606
Right here!

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.411
I'll escort you, ladies.
You can count on me.

00:05:22.444 --> 00:05:23.981
You'd do that?

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:27.555
Popp: This cave sounds
like a nasty place.

00:05:27.588 --> 00:05:31.061
It would be way too dangerous
to let you go in alone.

00:05:38.109 --> 00:05:39.913
[giggle]

00:05:39.946 --> 00:05:43.987
[pained groan]

00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:48.229
If you ask me, that look on
your face is more dangerous.

00:05:48.262 --> 00:05:50.334
How about I go
with you instead?

00:05:50.367 --> 00:05:51.837
That sounds great.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:52.939
It might be fun-

00:05:52.973 --> 00:05:55.611
for the two of us to finally
share the battlefield.

00:05:55.645 --> 00:05:58.115
Good. Then that
makes our party.

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:01.222
You two will need to change
into the Robes as well.

00:06:01.256 --> 00:06:02.626
Oh, man...

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:04.929
I'll see you soon, okay?

00:06:05.698 --> 00:06:07.300
Leona...

00:06:07.334 --> 00:06:09.706
What, you still
don't trust me?

00:06:09.739 --> 00:06:12.712
I can do whatever
I set my mind to.

00:06:14.014 --> 00:06:17.755
Haven't I always...
since we first met?

00:06:22.732 --> 00:06:23.433
[chuckling]

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:25.505
Huh? What is it?

00:06:25.538 --> 00:06:28.009
I was just remembering
when we met. Sorry.

00:06:28.042 --> 00:06:29.512
Leona: Oh, you forgot?

00:06:29.546 --> 00:06:31.315
Where are you going?

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:32.786
Dai: To keep on training!

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:34.421
With everything that's
about to happen...

00:06:34.454 --> 00:06:36.526
I need to know
I can back you up

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.064
when we face the
Dark King together!

00:06:42.104 --> 00:06:43.339
Alright.

00:06:43.373 --> 00:06:47.113
Let's use this time to train -
and become even better warriors!

00:06:47.147 --> 00:06:49.252
[cheering]

00:06:49.285 --> 00:06:50.220
Nova.

00:06:50.254 --> 00:06:51.222
Yes?

00:06:51.255 --> 00:06:54.161
I have... a favor
to ask of you.

00:06:55.163 --> 00:06:56.499
Merle: Hey, Maam?

00:06:56.533 --> 00:07:00.473
Don't you think you're being
a little too hard on Popp?

00:07:00.507 --> 00:07:02.512
Maam: I thought
I was going easy.

00:07:02.545 --> 00:07:05.216
It's like he doesn't understand
what's at stake here.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.820
If this fails,
the world could end.

00:07:06.853 --> 00:07:08.523
Flora: I'm sure
the Kaglimmer will be

00:07:08.557 --> 00:07:10.929
strong enough to
disarm Vearn Palace.

00:07:10.962 --> 00:07:12.197
But as the book says,

00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:14.936
the spell will be most
effective if the five of you

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.009
use your Insignias
to focus its power.

00:07:18.042 --> 00:07:19.946
That's something else
I'm worried about.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.117
Avan never taught
us how to use them.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.654
And if I can't pull it off,

00:07:23.687 --> 00:07:27.127
all I've got are my
Healing-type spells.

00:07:27.161 --> 00:07:31.235
All right, hold the Insignia
of Avan in your hand.

00:07:31.269 --> 00:07:32.905
Then breathe...
close your eyes,

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:36.145
and concentrate on the
people we're trying to save.

00:07:44.027 --> 00:07:47.067
Maam [thought]:
Hyunckel... Crocodine...

00:07:55.117 --> 00:08:00.226
Th-The Insignia... Why is it
glowing red like that?

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.567
Flora: That is the color
of you soul's energy, Maam.

00:08:03.601 --> 00:08:05.504
My soul's energy...

00:08:05.537 --> 00:08:07.542
Flora: The Great
Purification Spell

00:08:07.575 --> 00:08:10.147
requires more
than just Magic Power.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.084
It is a matter of intention;

00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:15.524
of the user's will
to overcome great evil.

00:08:15.557 --> 00:08:16.793
The Mysticite-

00:08:16.826 --> 00:08:19.966
it can respond to that
will and even amplify it.

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:23.372
That light is the proof
of your intention...

00:08:23.405 --> 00:08:25.210
And the true
source of your power

00:08:25.243 --> 00:08:27.649
is your pure
and loving heart.

00:08:27.682 --> 00:08:29.786
My "loving heart"?

00:08:29.819 --> 00:08:33.527
Your caring instinct,
and empathy for others...

00:08:33.561 --> 00:08:37.669
This is where your true
abilities really come from.

00:08:37.702 --> 00:08:40.608
Avan always believed
that such qualities were

00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:43.547
far more valuable
than strength and skill.

00:08:43.581 --> 00:08:46.586
And he only ever granted
his Insignia to people

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:50.426
whose souls were worthy
of protecting the world.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.166
This means that Dai,
Popp, and Hyunckel

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.972
should all have qualities of
their own which will cause

00:08:56.005 --> 00:08:58.644
the Mysticite to glow
a different color...

00:08:58.677 --> 00:09:01.916
A color that represents
each of their souls.

00:09:03.186 --> 00:09:05.924
Leona. You have one, too.

00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.163
The spell needs
the five of you-

00:09:08.196 --> 00:09:11.168
otherwise our plan
is never going to work.

00:09:16.647 --> 00:09:19.185
Popp [thought]: Whoa.
A unique color for

00:09:19.218 --> 00:09:20.955
each of our souls, huh?

00:09:20.989 --> 00:09:23.860
I wonder what color
mine will glow...

00:09:33.814 --> 00:09:35.885
Popp [thought]:
What... Nothing?

00:09:35.918 --> 00:09:38.658
I don't get it.
Maam got hers to light up

00:09:38.691 --> 00:09:41.361
and it seemed like
she wasn't even trying!

00:09:44.736 --> 00:09:46.138
Popp [thought]:
You're kidding me...

00:09:46.171 --> 00:09:48.944
I can't even get it
to light up a little!

00:09:48.978 --> 00:09:52.184
C'mon, glow!
Just a little spark...

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:53.887
Maam: Who's there?

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.532
Merle: Maam,
is something wrong?

00:09:59.565 --> 00:10:02.037
I thought I sensed
somebody out here.

00:10:02.071 --> 00:10:06.813
It would be just like Popp to
spy on us through the keyhole.

00:10:18.336 --> 00:10:20.808
It doesn't make any sense...

00:10:20.841 --> 00:10:23.345
There's gotta be
some way to make it work!

00:10:24.315 --> 00:10:25.551
What's the matter with me?

00:10:25.584 --> 00:10:30.193
If I don't get this to glow,
then I'll let everybody down.

00:10:30.226 --> 00:10:32.230
I can't let that happen.

00:10:32.264 --> 00:10:33.366
So then, what gives?

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:34.569
I mean, Avan picked me

00:10:34.603 --> 00:10:37.140
to be one of his Disciples
just like Maam...

00:10:37.675 --> 00:10:39.010
Like Maam...

00:10:40.079 --> 00:10:42.518
You know I can't, but
someday you'll understand.

00:10:42.552 --> 00:10:43.854
And until that day comes,

00:10:43.887 --> 00:10:46.726
I want you to
hold onto this for me.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.462
Popp [thought]:
Could this be...

00:10:48.495 --> 00:10:50.166
Could this be
because Dai and I

00:10:50.199 --> 00:10:53.940
got our Insignias before
we completed our training?

00:10:55.243 --> 00:10:56.178
We never graduated

00:10:56.212 --> 00:10:58.751
the way that
Maam and Hyunckel did.

00:10:58.784 --> 00:11:00.286
Does that mean...

00:11:00.319 --> 00:11:05.931
Am I... Am I unworthy of
being a Disciple of Avan?

00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:11.242
No way... No way!

00:11:11.275 --> 00:11:12.779
That can't be possible.

00:11:12.812 --> 00:11:16.653
Not after everything
I've overcome to get here.

00:11:16.686 --> 00:11:20.561
I just need to find a way
to make this thing glow.

00:11:20.594 --> 00:11:21.830
There is a way.

00:11:21.863 --> 00:11:25.605
I'll prove you were right
about me, Master Avan!

00:11:25.638 --> 00:11:27.708
This Ancient Tome
was written by a Sage

00:11:27.742 --> 00:11:30.882
who explored the Cave
of Trials long ago...

00:11:30.915 --> 00:11:33.419
And they included a map.

00:11:33.452 --> 00:11:37.327
So, Kaglimmer... How deep do
we have to go to find it?

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.031
Twenty-five levels down.

00:11:39.064 --> 00:11:42.939
In comparison, the Glimmer
spell that Avan obtained...

00:11:42.972 --> 00:11:45.243
was only fifteen down.

00:11:45.276 --> 00:11:46.312
Maam: You mean,

00:11:46.345 --> 00:11:48.850
we're going even deeper
than Master Avan ever did?

00:11:48.884 --> 00:11:50.420
There's no time to waste.

00:11:50.453 --> 00:11:53.861
We have thirty hours left
to rescue our comrades.

00:11:53.894 --> 00:11:55.964
We will need ten of
those to prepare and

00:11:55.998 --> 00:11:58.469
get to where Hyunckel
and Crocodine are held.

00:11:58.503 --> 00:12:01.275
That leaves us with twenty
to search the cavern.

00:12:01.876 --> 00:12:03.145
Flora: Frizz.

00:12:04.649 --> 00:12:06.586
This candle's light
will magically burn

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.256
for ten hours or so.

00:12:08.289 --> 00:12:10.126
Then, once it goes out,

00:12:10.159 --> 00:12:14.168
we should start heading
back to the surface.

00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:18.544
Now, I can cast Evac, a spell
for escaping dungeons...

00:12:18.577 --> 00:12:21.950
but it will not
work inside this cave.

00:12:21.984 --> 00:12:25.524
Flora: The Malice in its walls
interferes with enchantments,

00:12:25.558 --> 00:12:27.595
and we have no
way to repel it.

00:12:27.629 --> 00:12:31.936
Therefore, we must assume our
return trip will take ten hours.

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:33.840
Are you saying
if we can't make it

00:12:33.874 --> 00:12:36.045
all the way down
in that time,

00:12:36.078 --> 00:12:38.282
we'll have to give up on
the Kaglimmer spell?

00:12:38.316 --> 00:12:41.121
Yes. We'll come
back to the surface

00:12:41.154 --> 00:12:44.495
and try to save Hyunckel
and Crocodine without it.

00:12:44.529 --> 00:12:46.131
Although...

00:12:46.165 --> 00:12:50.106
this map and Merle's
abilities give us an advantage.

00:12:50.139 --> 00:12:52.778
As long as we're careful
about the monsters,

00:12:52.812 --> 00:12:55.718
we should make good time.

00:12:55.751 --> 00:12:58.790
All right, come along.
Let's get moving.

00:13:04.669 --> 00:13:06.105
It sure is creepy down here.

00:13:06.138 --> 00:13:09.344
Maam: Seriously. It seems
like it goes on forever.

00:13:09.377 --> 00:13:13.386
I can sense quite a few
dangerous Auras lurking below.

00:13:13.419 --> 00:13:15.189
Large ones, too.

00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:18.029
Wait, Maam - you shouldn't...

00:13:18.062 --> 00:13:20.500
What? This dress
keeps flapping around.

00:13:20.534 --> 00:13:22.036
I'm going to trip on it.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:23.807
Merle: It's not proper...

00:13:23.841 --> 00:13:25.878
Take it easy, Merle.

00:13:25.911 --> 00:13:27.982
This is no...
"preppy" royal banquet.

00:13:28.015 --> 00:13:30.153
But it's a bad
influence on Popp.

00:13:30.186 --> 00:13:32.525
Don't you see this sort
of thing is exactly

00:13:32.558 --> 00:13:34.596
what gets his mind
in the gutter.

00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:36.098
Wait. Are you joking?

00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:39.104
I think Popp was born with
his mind in the gutter.

00:13:39.138 --> 00:13:39.706
[sighing]

00:13:39.739 --> 00:13:40.707
Merle: That's not true.

00:13:40.741 --> 00:13:41.742
Leona [thought]: Oh, yeah.

00:13:41.776 --> 00:13:44.147
This mission is
going spectacularly.

00:13:44.181 --> 00:13:46.485
It's not a picnic, girls.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.391
Focus. We're about to
reach the first level.

00:13:56.305 --> 00:13:58.109
Slimes: [chirping]

00:13:58.142 --> 00:13:59.444
Slimes!

00:14:02.718 --> 00:14:04.154
Alright.

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.046
[chirping]

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.315
Well, they might be weak,

00:14:18.348 --> 00:14:20.019
but fighting off
this many of them

00:14:20.052 --> 00:14:22.490
is going to
take us forever.

00:14:31.877 --> 00:14:34.716
Flora: I said we don't
have any time to waste.

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:36.151
Let's keep moving.

00:14:36.184 --> 00:14:39.224
Maam: By the way, what spell can
we learn on the first level?

00:14:39.258 --> 00:14:41.362
Merle: The tome says
"Safe Passage."

00:14:41.395 --> 00:14:44.669
Oh, we can skip that.
I already know it.

00:14:44.702 --> 00:14:46.205
We'll skip all of them.

00:14:46.238 --> 00:14:49.477
Kaglimmer is the one we need.
It's the priority.

00:14:54.188 --> 00:14:55.724
Popp [thought]: Huh.
Nova's giving him

00:14:55.758 --> 00:14:57.528
a hand with his training.

00:14:57.561 --> 00:14:58.797
Dai's the only other one

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:01.803
who got his Insignia
before he was ready.

00:15:01.836 --> 00:15:04.240
I wonder if his will light up?

00:15:07.815 --> 00:15:10.186
Oh, yeah -
that's more like it.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.992
It seems like you've gotten
over yourself, have you?

00:15:13.025 --> 00:15:15.463
I can't be moping
around anymore.

00:15:15.496 --> 00:15:18.436
King Vearn won't get
the better of me twice.

00:15:18.469 --> 00:15:19.639
No matter how minor...

00:15:19.672 --> 00:15:23.279
all of my skills will be at
their best in this fight.

00:15:23.312 --> 00:15:26.218
And then - he goes
down for good!

00:15:29.659 --> 00:15:31.061
Here we go!

00:15:33.132 --> 00:15:34.502
Popp [thought]: Oh, no!

00:15:34.536 --> 00:15:36.037
Then it's just me...

00:15:36.071 --> 00:15:39.177
I'm the only one
who can't do it.

00:15:39.211 --> 00:15:42.719
Popp [thought]: I have
to do something, and quick.

00:15:42.752 --> 00:15:45.055
I'm running out of time.

00:15:46.258 --> 00:15:48.295
Good. That covers the basics.

00:15:48.329 --> 00:15:51.235
From here, we'll base your
training on the Book of Avan.

00:15:51.268 --> 00:15:52.236
Great!

00:15:53.573 --> 00:15:58.415
Popp: I'll push myself...
I'll do it. I can do it!

00:16:16.719 --> 00:16:20.192
The deeper we go - the
stronger the monsters will be.

00:16:20.225 --> 00:16:23.499
That's what the
ancient tome says.

00:16:23.534 --> 00:16:28.710
Well, I'm not sensing any more
of them on this level. For now.

00:16:28.743 --> 00:16:31.481
Flora: The next staircase
shouldn't be too far.

00:16:32.751 --> 00:16:33.954
What is it?

00:16:33.987 --> 00:16:36.760
It's a vase!
Look at this thing.

00:16:36.793 --> 00:16:38.195
I wonder what's inside.

00:16:38.228 --> 00:16:41.268
Flora: Whatever it is, it's
not what we're after. Come on.

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:45.376
Huh?! What?! But it
might be useful?

00:16:56.365 --> 00:16:58.268
Avan Strash!

00:17:15.303 --> 00:17:18.109
Yes! I can do it.
I can use them both!

00:17:18.142 --> 00:17:20.714
That was the projectile type,
right? What's it called?

00:17:20.747 --> 00:17:25.222
Let's see. Okay, so...
according to the Book of Avan,

00:17:25.256 --> 00:17:27.995
there are two types
of Avan Strash.

00:17:28.028 --> 00:17:29.565
Nova: The Arrow-Type,

00:17:29.599 --> 00:17:31.669
where you strike your
enemy from a distance,

00:17:31.702 --> 00:17:33.238
using only a slash of Aura...

00:17:33.272 --> 00:17:34.675
And the Break-Type,

00:17:34.708 --> 00:17:38.851
where you use the full force
of your Aura for a direct hit.

00:17:38.884 --> 00:17:40.553
Arrow and Break, huh?

00:17:40.587 --> 00:17:44.228
"Each type has its advantage
as well as its disadvantage.

00:17:44.261 --> 00:17:46.933
The Arrow Type can
be unleashed quickly,

00:17:46.966 --> 00:17:49.004
but it has a weaker impact.

00:17:49.037 --> 00:17:51.041
The Break Type
is more powerful,

00:17:51.074 --> 00:17:53.078
and still has
reasonable speed,

00:17:53.112 --> 00:17:56.686
but it takes much longer
to unleash each attack."

00:17:56.719 --> 00:17:58.188
Each battle is different and

00:17:58.222 --> 00:18:00.259
will ask a different
skill of you-

00:18:00.292 --> 00:18:02.197
the user must have
quick judgement...

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:06.004
and keen situational awareness
of one's environment."

00:18:06.038 --> 00:18:07.440
That's all it says.

00:18:07.473 --> 00:18:11.114
I see. I've been
using it all this time

00:18:11.147 --> 00:18:13.520
without thinking
about any of that.

00:18:13.553 --> 00:18:14.487
If I'd known,

00:18:14.521 --> 00:18:17.326
I probably could've
fought more efficiently.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.230
It's kind of embarrassing.

00:18:19.263 --> 00:18:21.503
Nova: No need
to be embarrassed.

00:18:21.536 --> 00:18:22.605
Watch this.

00:18:22.638 --> 00:18:23.506
What?

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.478
I know how to strike
using Aura Blade.

00:18:26.512 --> 00:18:30.620
It's no Avan Strash but
it projects Aura, as well.

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:38.202
Do you see?

00:18:38.235 --> 00:18:40.507
As adept as I am
with this type of move,

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:43.312
I still struggle to
hit the smallest target...

00:18:43.346 --> 00:18:44.748
And timing the
whole thing out,

00:18:44.782 --> 00:18:47.186
so that it detonates at
the moment of impact-

00:18:47.219 --> 00:18:48.923
can be a chore.

00:18:48.957 --> 00:18:51.194
Aura attacks are
very advanced.

00:18:51.228 --> 00:18:53.934
My guess is, even Sir
Avan didn't expect you

00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:56.606
to master the Avan
Strash so quickly.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.543
And that's why he
never got around to

00:18:58.577 --> 00:19:01.683
explaining the different
types of Strash to you.

00:19:01.716 --> 00:19:03.418
Yeah. You must be right.

00:19:03.452 --> 00:19:08.362
But still, if I... only
knew how to read, well then,

00:19:08.395 --> 00:19:10.534
I could have learned
that for myself back when

00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:12.738
Matoriv first gave us
the Book of Avan.

00:19:14.875 --> 00:19:16.879
Well, that's
definitely on you.

00:19:16.913 --> 00:19:18.517
But... now you know,

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:21.321
and that's the only thing
that really matters here.

00:19:21.355 --> 00:19:24.327
All that's left for you
to do is practice it.

00:19:24.361 --> 00:19:27.366
So just don't waste
your time, Dai.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.404
Dai: I owe you one, Nova.

00:19:29.437 --> 00:19:32.644
No, no. Save your thanks
for Princess Leona.

00:19:32.678 --> 00:19:33.613
Huh?

00:19:33.646 --> 00:19:36.653
Nova: She's the one
who asked me to help.

00:19:36.686 --> 00:19:39.725
You can tell her
if she makes it back.

00:19:39.758 --> 00:19:43.398
She will. There's
no doubt about it.

00:19:44.067 --> 00:19:46.171
You really believe in her.

00:19:46.204 --> 00:19:47.608
Well, Leona...

00:19:47.641 --> 00:19:50.781
She always succeeds in
whatever she sets her mind to.

00:19:50.814 --> 00:19:51.983
Always has.

00:19:52.016 --> 00:19:53.753
[screeching]

00:19:53.787 --> 00:19:56.224
[snarling]

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:01.669
[exasperated sigh]

00:20:01.703 --> 00:20:02.971
Oh, come on, Leona!

00:20:03.004 --> 00:20:04.541
Didn't I tell you not to open

00:20:04.575 --> 00:20:06.713
the treasure chests
down here? Huh?

00:20:06.746 --> 00:20:07.413
[bashful chuckle]

00:20:07.447 --> 00:20:08.950
I couldn't help it.

00:20:08.983 --> 00:20:12.791
It seems like such a waste
to ignore them completely.

00:20:12.825 --> 00:20:14.127
Girl, gimme a break.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.130
I bet you also buy
mountains of stuff

00:20:16.164 --> 00:20:18.468
whenever you go
shopping, don't you?

00:20:19.805 --> 00:20:23.278
But, umm, that's the
whole point of shopping.

00:20:23.312 --> 00:20:24.548
And considering
where we are,

00:20:24.581 --> 00:20:26.351
I thought we might
find a weapon

00:20:26.384 --> 00:20:28.122
that could save
the world or something.

00:20:28.155 --> 00:20:29.123
Was I wrong?

00:20:29.157 --> 00:20:30.694
Flora: What have
we found so far?

00:20:30.727 --> 00:20:34.635
A pair of Cypress Sticks and
two-hundred and sixteen gold.

00:20:34.668 --> 00:20:36.371
And we're definitely
not going to

00:20:36.405 --> 00:20:38.776
save the world with
either, Princess.

00:20:40.313 --> 00:20:42.217
Okay, fine. I get it.

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:45.389
Onward it is then,
right? Away we go!

00:20:45.423 --> 00:20:48.663
Almost at ten hours...
We're taking too long.

00:20:48.697 --> 00:20:52.938
We're eighteen floors down.
That's nowhere close.

00:20:52.972 --> 00:20:55.944
We should start thinking
about heading back up.

00:20:55.977 --> 00:20:57.313
I didn't expect that we'd be

00:20:57.346 --> 00:20:59.551
stopping at every
level on the way.

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.190
Princess Leona...

00:21:02.223 --> 00:21:03.125
Wait a minute!

00:21:03.158 --> 00:21:04.360
Leona: Ugh! What?

00:21:04.394 --> 00:21:08.034
What am I doing
wrong this time?

00:21:08.068 --> 00:21:12.243
Oh... No... I mean,
it's not that.

00:21:12.276 --> 00:21:13.946
Leona: Well, then?
What is it?

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:17.621
Go on, Merle. It's all right.
Just tell us what's wrong.

00:21:17.655 --> 00:21:21.629
It's a... feeling.
Or a premonition...

00:21:21.663 --> 00:21:24.702
Whatever it is,
s-spit it out!

00:21:24.735 --> 00:21:26.505
It's this floor...

00:21:28.342 --> 00:21:31.014
Merle: If we stay in
one place for too long...

00:21:31.048 --> 00:21:33.352
I think it might collapse.

00:21:33.385 --> 00:21:34.721
[worried breaths]

00:21:38.195 --> 00:21:40.399
Head back to
the stairs. Hurry!

00:21:42.369 --> 00:21:43.172
Hey, Merle...

00:21:43.205 --> 00:21:44.473
Y-Yes?

00:21:44.508 --> 00:21:47.079
Next time that you get a
feeling, tell me to shut up!

00:21:47.113 --> 00:21:48.348
Yep!

00:23:37.701 --> 00:23:39.470
Narrator: Thanks to
his training with Nova,

00:23:39.505 --> 00:23:40.874
Dai discovers a new attack

00:23:40.908 --> 00:23:43.412
with more potential
than ever before.

00:23:43.445 --> 00:23:45.817
Meanwhile, Popp grows
even more desperate

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:48.957
when his Insignia of
Avan refuses to glow.

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:50.059
In the Cave of Trials,

00:23:50.092 --> 00:23:52.564
Leona's party reach
the twenty-fifth level,

00:23:52.597 --> 00:23:55.268
where the key to the
Kaglimmer spell awaits,

00:23:55.302 --> 00:23:57.575
but what dangers
are lurking nearby?

00:23:57.608 --> 00:23:58.743
Find out next time on

00:23:58.776 --> 00:24:01.080
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:01.114 --> 00:24:03.451
"The Sacred Inheritance".
