WEBVTT

00:01:50.354 --> 00:01:53.794
Please, sir! We're in trouble.
You have to help us!

00:01:53.828 --> 00:01:56.633
Matoriv: I don't want
anything to do with anyone.

00:01:57.769 --> 00:01:59.873
You... I know you!

00:01:59.906 --> 00:02:00.742
Matoriv: Hm?

00:02:00.775 --> 00:02:02.645
Uncle Matoriv! It's you!

00:02:05.818 --> 00:02:07.121
[gasp]

00:02:07.154 --> 00:02:08.891
Is it really you?!

00:02:11.095 --> 00:02:12.699
Darling Maam!

00:02:14.803 --> 00:02:16.372
And look how you've grown!

00:02:16.406 --> 00:02:19.613
You look just like how your
mother did at your age!

00:02:19.646 --> 00:02:20.916
As if!

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:22.619
Calm down, young lady.

00:02:22.652 --> 00:02:25.959
I changed your diapers when
you were a baby, remember?

00:02:25.992 --> 00:02:27.729
Now give me a proper greeting.

00:02:27.762 --> 00:02:30.400
You haven't changed
at all you creepy old man.

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:32.973
Wait a second;
you know this guy, Maam?

00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:35.244
I don't just know him.
This is my...

00:02:35.277 --> 00:02:37.414
Matoriv! Now I remember.

00:02:37.447 --> 00:02:40.955
The Mage who fought the Dark
Lord's army alongside the Hero,

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.730
and then went on to serve the
Papnica royal family, as well!

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:47.134
Baduck: The Grand
Sorcerer Matoriv!

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.573
By Hero, you mean
Master Avan?

00:02:49.606 --> 00:02:50.574
That's right.

00:02:50.608 --> 00:02:53.981
My uncle was a member of
our Master Avan's party.

00:02:54.015 --> 00:02:56.452
And how is your
mother doing, Maam?

00:02:56.485 --> 00:02:59.859
If she's still single, I could
always marry her, you know.

00:02:59.893 --> 00:03:01.262
[laughing]

00:03:01.295 --> 00:03:03.968
He used to visit our village
a lot before he vanished,

00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:05.437
I remember,
but it's been years

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.708
and I had no idea
he was hiding out here.

00:03:07.742 --> 00:03:10.715
This old guy was really in
the legendary party, back then?

00:03:10.748 --> 00:03:13.186
Normally, I wouldn't
be so happy to see him,

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:14.956
but today's a
little different.

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:15.926
This is great.

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.227
With the mess we're in,

00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:19.600
no one could be more helpful
than the Grand Sorcerer.

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:22.204
Now - now, we have
a fighting chance!

00:03:22.237 --> 00:03:24.710
We could really use
your skills, Matoriv!

00:03:24.743 --> 00:03:27.982
So, I beg of you - will you
help us rescue Princess Leona?

00:03:28.016 --> 00:03:29.719
Princess?

00:03:29.752 --> 00:03:30.988
That's right.

00:03:31.022 --> 00:03:34.194
The Princess of Papnica is being
held prisoner on Valge Island.

00:03:34.228 --> 00:03:36.833
I'm sure the illustrious
Matoriv could overcome

00:03:36.867 --> 00:03:38.871
our enemy's strange spell!

00:03:38.904 --> 00:03:40.440
Please! What say you?

00:03:41.577 --> 00:03:42.478
No, thanks.

00:03:42.512 --> 00:03:43.814
W-What?!

00:03:43.847 --> 00:03:45.416
I said no thanks.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.158
My days of helping that
silly royal family are over!

00:03:49.192 --> 00:03:51.329
Silly? The royal family?!

00:03:51.362 --> 00:03:53.333
Matoriv: It's
not just the royalty,

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:55.237
it's people in general.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.542
Of course, when the
Dark Army was attacking,

00:03:57.575 --> 00:04:00.681
they'd butter us up
so we'd go fight for them.

00:04:00.715 --> 00:04:01.917
But once peace came,

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.627
they all suddenly turned their
backs on us - big surprise.

00:04:06.661 --> 00:04:11.468
Sure, I got to be advisor to the
king after the battle was over,

00:04:11.503 --> 00:04:15.911
but I was constantly being
badgered by the other officials.

00:04:16.713 --> 00:04:17.649
[weary sigh]

00:04:17.682 --> 00:04:20.287
They were all jealous
of my magic skills.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.157
That's people for you.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.563
They think of
nothing but themselves.

00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:28.904
I grew tired of them all and
decided to live in this cave.

00:04:28.938 --> 00:04:31.041
I may have saved
you on a whim,

00:04:31.075 --> 00:04:33.246
but that's as
far as it goes.

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:36.319
Besides, even if I help
you, once the job is over,

00:04:36.352 --> 00:04:38.390
you'll just forget
about me anyway,

00:04:38.423 --> 00:04:40.561
'cause that's just
the way things go.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:42.798
But, that's...

00:04:43.834 --> 00:04:45.103
Dai: That's not true.

00:04:45.137 --> 00:04:47.374
[surprised breaths]

00:04:51.382 --> 00:04:53.587
Whoa, Dai... you, uh...

00:04:53.621 --> 00:04:57.060
Not everybody thinks only
about themselves like you say!

00:04:57.094 --> 00:05:01.603
If you were Master Avan's
companion, you should know that!

00:05:01.636 --> 00:05:05.043
Matoriv: Those eyes... Avan?!

00:05:05.076 --> 00:05:07.013
I know that look.

00:05:09.686 --> 00:05:10.754
And you are?

00:05:10.788 --> 00:05:15.030
My name's Dai, and I'm
Master Avan's last student!

00:05:15.063 --> 00:05:16.299
Last?

00:05:16.332 --> 00:05:21.342
Master, he... He gave his
own life... to save us!

00:05:22.277 --> 00:05:26.453
I see. So Avan
is dead. I'm sorry.

00:05:26.486 --> 00:05:27.855
That's why we're here.

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.362
We want to avenge his death
by defeating the Dark Army.

00:05:31.395 --> 00:05:35.103
So, please, sir!
Lend us your strength!

00:05:44.054 --> 00:05:45.457
I'm listening.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.827
[happy breaths]

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.198
[happy chirps]

00:05:49.231 --> 00:05:51.971
Matoriv: That's
Legendary Forbidden Magic.

00:05:52.004 --> 00:05:55.678
Maam: I think Flazzard
mentioned something like that.

00:05:55.711 --> 00:05:56.780
What is it?

00:05:56.813 --> 00:06:00.020
Forbidden Magic is magic
so dirty that its use has

00:06:00.053 --> 00:06:02.858
been banned across the
continents for centuries.

00:06:02.892 --> 00:06:06.700
Anyone who uses it will
become a pariah among Mages.

00:06:06.734 --> 00:06:09.438
So then what can we do
to save Princess Leona?

00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:12.712
Matoriv: First, you break
the Blizzblaze Curse Field.

00:06:12.745 --> 00:06:15.350
To do that, you have to
approach outside the field

00:06:15.383 --> 00:06:17.922
and destroy these two Spires.

00:06:17.955 --> 00:06:21.630
That means, you'll need bombs
that pack a hefty punch.

00:06:21.663 --> 00:06:24.836
Then you leave that to me!
I'm an expert.

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:25.838
Matoriv: Good.

00:06:25.872 --> 00:06:28.978
You can use anything you
find here for materials.

00:06:29.011 --> 00:06:29.979
[intrigued sigh]

00:06:30.013 --> 00:06:33.854
Don't forget, they need
to pack a hefty punch.

00:06:33.888 --> 00:06:35.991
Popp: We don't need
any silly bombs.

00:06:36.025 --> 00:06:39.498
I can just blow those
things up with my magic!

00:06:41.035 --> 00:06:43.039
[inconspicuous whistling]

00:06:43.073 --> 00:06:45.644
Matoriv: He's not a
Disciple of Avan, too, is he?

00:06:45.678 --> 00:06:49.118
Yeah, that's Popp.
He's a Mage just like you.

00:06:49.151 --> 00:06:50.721
Matoriv: Lend him to me.

00:06:50.755 --> 00:06:52.692
Huh? Does he show promise?

00:06:52.725 --> 00:06:54.161
Matoriv: Quite the opposite.

00:06:54.194 --> 00:06:57.735
I've never seen a Mage
who looked so weak willed.

00:06:57.769 --> 00:07:00.541
If I don't do something,
he's going to die out there.

00:07:00.574 --> 00:07:02.612
O-Oh, really?

00:07:02.646 --> 00:07:04.081
But don't you fret.

00:07:04.114 --> 00:07:06.419
I'll train him with
a Special Hard Course

00:07:06.452 --> 00:07:08.924
that's even harder
than Hero Avan's.

00:07:08.957 --> 00:07:10.828
[chuckling]

00:07:10.861 --> 00:07:12.498
Zaboera: What?!

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:15.103
What did you just say,
Lord Hadlar?!

00:07:15.136 --> 00:07:17.007
A full-on assault, Zaboera.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.044
They'll surely make
an attempt to destroy

00:07:19.078 --> 00:07:22.552
the Dark Flame and Dark Ice
Spires before too long,

00:07:22.585 --> 00:07:23.821
will they not?

00:07:23.854 --> 00:07:26.927
And when they do, they'll
split up their forces.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.897
So we will gather
all of our armies,

00:07:28.931 --> 00:07:32.805
then wipe out Dai
and his companions.

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:33.607
Oh?

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.443
But Flazzard
will complain about

00:07:35.477 --> 00:07:38.483
not being able to take
all the credit for it.

00:07:38.517 --> 00:07:40.654
Flazzard is a
monster that I created

00:07:40.688 --> 00:07:43.293
using Legendary
Forbidden Magic.

00:07:43.326 --> 00:07:48.003
In a way, Flazzard is my son.
He won't disobey my orders.

00:07:48.036 --> 00:07:49.204
Intriguing.

00:07:49.238 --> 00:07:50.742
At last, my Dragon Legion

00:07:50.775 --> 00:07:53.446
will be able to play
a role in this task.

00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:55.016
Not yet, Baran.

00:07:55.049 --> 00:07:58.456
I have another assignment
more suited to your skills.

00:07:58.489 --> 00:07:59.859
And what's that?

00:07:59.893 --> 00:08:01.696
Our friend
Mystvearn has been

00:08:01.729 --> 00:08:03.567
laying siege to
the Carl Kingdom,

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.303
but their forces
are proving to be

00:08:05.337 --> 00:08:07.207
more resilient
than we thought.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.115
I'd like for you to go take down
them down yourself, knight.

00:08:11.148 --> 00:08:14.889
You have already asked us to
gather all of our forces here.

00:08:14.922 --> 00:08:17.394
Defeating the Hero
is our priority.

00:08:17.427 --> 00:08:19.465
Is that not why the
Six Legion Commanders

00:08:19.498 --> 00:08:22.070
were summoned in the
first place, Hadlar?!

00:08:23.774 --> 00:08:26.078
Or is there some...
other reason,

00:08:26.112 --> 00:08:30.554
you don't want me to face this
supposedly important boy, Dai?

00:08:34.394 --> 00:08:39.137
Talk all you want, Baran,
but the order still stands.

00:08:40.239 --> 00:08:41.442
Very well, then.

00:08:41.475 --> 00:08:46.452
I will follow your orders this
time, Dark Commander. Now...

00:08:46.485 --> 00:08:49.492
I'm off to the Carl Kingdom.

00:08:49.526 --> 00:08:51.062
Zaboera [thought]:
What is it about Baran

00:08:51.095 --> 00:08:54.803
that makes Lord Hadlar
treat him so?

00:08:54.836 --> 00:08:56.105
Lord Hadlar [thought]:
Not even Baran

00:08:56.139 --> 00:08:59.244
can overthrow the Carl
Kingdom that easily...

00:08:59.277 --> 00:09:03.621
But we must rid ourselves
of Dai before he does.

00:09:03.654 --> 00:09:07.595
We shall make
Valge Island their grave!

00:09:14.976 --> 00:09:17.681
[pained groan]

00:09:18.249 --> 00:09:19.553
H-hey, what the...

00:09:19.586 --> 00:09:21.089
This is Nayle Village.

00:09:21.122 --> 00:09:24.327
That was Zoom; an instant
transmission spell.

00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:26.198
You just have to
think of a location,

00:09:26.231 --> 00:09:29.972
and it will take you there
in the blink of an eye, see?

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:33.213
Mina: Popp!

00:09:33.246 --> 00:09:34.849
Leira: Matoriv, you're back...
I haven't seen you in-

00:09:34.882 --> 00:09:37.655
Hello, Leira,
long time no see.

00:09:37.689 --> 00:09:39.291
I ran into your daughter.

00:09:39.324 --> 00:09:40.460
Maam?

00:09:40.493 --> 00:09:42.898
She's filled out very nicely.

00:09:42.932 --> 00:09:45.504
Just like you
when you were young.

00:09:45.537 --> 00:09:47.241
But, why are
you here with Popp?

00:09:47.274 --> 00:09:48.844
It's complicated.

00:09:48.877 --> 00:09:51.984
Figured I'd give his butt
a well-deserved kick.

00:09:52.017 --> 00:09:53.252
Come on!

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:54.690
Aw, poor Popp...

00:09:54.723 --> 00:09:55.891
Matoriv: Get over here.

00:09:55.925 --> 00:09:57.928
-Popp: I get it, I get it!
-Matoriv: Shut up.

00:09:57.962 --> 00:10:00.433
He seems like a
really mean old man.

00:10:00.466 --> 00:10:01.369
[chuckling]

00:10:01.402 --> 00:10:02.304
He is.

00:10:02.337 --> 00:10:03.774
But if he's
the one teaching,

00:10:03.807 --> 00:10:06.813
I have no doubt that
Popp will get stronger.

00:10:06.847 --> 00:10:09.351
There was once a time
that Matoriv was considered

00:10:09.384 --> 00:10:11.890
the greatest of all the Mages.

00:10:11.923 --> 00:10:13.827
But he can be a bit quirky.

00:10:15.363 --> 00:10:18.604
[terrified screaming]

00:10:18.637 --> 00:10:21.543
How will this let me
use powerful magic?!

00:10:21.576 --> 00:10:26.118
Idiot! This is nothing but a
basic stamina building warm-up.

00:10:26.151 --> 00:10:29.792
Better pick up the pace
quick or you'll get trampled!

00:10:31.696 --> 00:10:35.336
[pained yelp]

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.374
You see? I knew
you could do it.

00:10:37.407 --> 00:10:39.211
[chuckling]

00:10:45.791 --> 00:10:48.329
Frizz doesn't work
well underwater!

00:10:48.363 --> 00:10:51.936
Find another way out
before you drown, young mage.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:54.876
I'll give you a little clue;

00:10:54.909 --> 00:10:56.846
it's not a spell
that'll save you!

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.888
Release the Magic Power
from your entire body!

00:11:03.526 --> 00:11:05.998
Oh, dear. Maybe
I read him wrong?

00:11:09.271 --> 00:11:12.277
[coughing]

00:11:23.332 --> 00:11:25.002
Oh! Sorry, Dai!

00:11:27.474 --> 00:11:28.844
We should stop for now.

00:11:28.877 --> 00:11:30.648
You still haven't fully healed,

00:11:30.681 --> 00:11:32.484
and you're pushing
yourself too hard.

00:11:32.518 --> 00:11:33.921
But I'm fine!

00:11:33.954 --> 00:11:37.628
I can't just rest when Popp
is out there training so hard!

00:11:37.661 --> 00:11:39.699
Besides, Matoriv
said this practice

00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:41.269
would help me fight Flazzard,

00:11:41.302 --> 00:11:44.676
and I'm not going
to lose to him again.

00:11:44.709 --> 00:11:47.113
Dai: I'll never
forgive that monster...

00:11:47.146 --> 00:11:50.420
Just when I
finally found Leona!

00:11:50.453 --> 00:11:51.990
I'm going to defeat him!

00:11:52.024 --> 00:11:55.329
And I'm going to rescue her,
no matter what it takes!

00:11:55.363 --> 00:11:59.037
Maam [thought]: I've never
seen Dai so emotional before.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:03.012
Princess Leona must
really be important to him.

00:12:03.045 --> 00:12:05.350
All right, then!
Let's keep going!

00:12:05.383 --> 00:12:06.285
Come on!

00:12:18.644 --> 00:12:27.260
[growling]

00:12:27.293 --> 00:12:28.930
[pained groan]

00:12:31.603 --> 00:12:32.972
Please... No more.

00:12:33.006 --> 00:12:35.544
A truly pathetic display.

00:12:35.577 --> 00:12:36.947
We've spent the
whole day together

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.086
and your Magic Power
has barely increased.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.092
You should be deeply ashamed
that a hundred year-old

00:12:43.126 --> 00:12:45.497
like me beat a
youngster like you.

00:12:45.531 --> 00:12:46.833
A hundred?!

00:12:46.866 --> 00:12:49.605
Well, I guess
that's all for today.

00:12:49.639 --> 00:12:52.678
[disappointed sigh]

00:12:52.711 --> 00:12:55.116
I'm heading back
to my cave in Papnica.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.988
You'll have to use your own
Zoom spell to get there.

00:12:58.021 --> 00:13:01.462
What?! But there's no way
I can do that without help!

00:13:01.495 --> 00:13:02.598
But it's easy.

00:13:02.631 --> 00:13:04.502
You flew from the
river to the shore

00:13:04.535 --> 00:13:06.305
by releasing your Magic Power-

00:13:06.338 --> 00:13:07.474
isn't that right?

00:13:07.508 --> 00:13:10.848
If you have a clear image
of your destination in mind,

00:13:10.881 --> 00:13:13.185
then Zoom is a piece of cake.

00:13:13.218 --> 00:13:15.791
But from the river to
shore is totally different

00:13:15.825 --> 00:13:17.895
than from here to Papnica.

00:13:17.929 --> 00:13:19.965
Besides, even if
I do learn Zoom,

00:13:19.999 --> 00:13:22.304
it's still
useless in battle!

00:13:22.337 --> 00:13:24.007
Wise up, weakling!

00:13:24.743 --> 00:13:27.046
Use magic to aid
your companions-

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.986
don't use it to lead
them into battle!

00:13:30.019 --> 00:13:32.525
A deep knowledge of
spells is necessary!

00:13:32.558 --> 00:13:33.893
Get that through
your head because

00:13:33.927 --> 00:13:36.232
this is what a Mage
is meant to do!

00:13:36.265 --> 00:13:39.104
Don't you see, that if you
had used Zoom back there,

00:13:39.137 --> 00:13:40.974
you could have rescued
your companions from

00:13:41.007 --> 00:13:45.015
that burning Balloon Ship
entirely on your own?!

00:13:45.049 --> 00:13:47.889
Don't talk like you're
anything more than a novice!

00:13:47.922 --> 00:13:50.160
If you can't clear
a challenge this easy,

00:13:50.193 --> 00:13:53.933
you'll only drag everyone
else down with you.

00:13:55.102 --> 00:13:56.806
Even if you do join the fight,

00:13:56.839 --> 00:13:58.577
you're just going
to end up dead.

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:02.417
You can wander around
the Dark Forest for eternity!

00:14:02.818 --> 00:14:04.320
No, no. Wait!

00:14:05.858 --> 00:14:09.164
Oh, come on!

00:14:09.197 --> 00:14:13.740
Ah, Grand Sorcerer!
I've completed the bombs.

00:14:13.774 --> 00:14:16.445
These are useless.
The design is poor.

00:14:16.478 --> 00:14:17.380
The design?

00:14:17.414 --> 00:14:19.985
Go for a more
sophisticated shape.

00:14:20.019 --> 00:14:21.689
They're going to
get blown up anyway,

00:14:21.723 --> 00:14:25.396
so who really cares what they're
going to look like before that?

00:14:29.371 --> 00:14:32.210
Well, it looks like
you're making progress.

00:14:33.245 --> 00:14:34.448
Matoriv!

00:14:34.481 --> 00:14:36.820
Once you cut through the unseen,
you'll feel the difference.

00:14:36.853 --> 00:14:38.189
Your blade will become three,

00:14:38.222 --> 00:14:41.094
or even five times
more powerful yet.

00:14:41.128 --> 00:14:42.564
So then, keep it up.

00:14:42.598 --> 00:14:44.068
Maam: Wait, where's Popp?

00:14:44.101 --> 00:14:46.740
Him? He's dead in
the woods, somewhere.

00:14:46.773 --> 00:14:48.008
Both: What?!

00:14:48.041 --> 00:14:50.146
And what a pampered
little whiner that boy was.

00:14:50.179 --> 00:14:53.486
His type never try unless
you make 'em desperate.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:58.362
That's why I left him over on
the other side of the world.

00:14:58.396 --> 00:15:02.304
Avan was always too soft of
a teacher for his own good.

00:15:02.337 --> 00:15:06.178
He couldn't train a
crybaby like that Popp.

00:15:06.211 --> 00:15:09.519
What he needs is my kind
of tough love - he'll see!

00:15:09.552 --> 00:15:10.987
[chuckling]

00:15:11.021 --> 00:15:13.292
Maam [thought]:
He enjoys this?

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.206
Flazzard: Can you hear me?!

00:15:20.239 --> 00:15:23.145
You little Disciples of Avan!

00:15:23.178 --> 00:15:26.953
Flazzard: How long do you think
you can hide from me, huh?!

00:15:28.355 --> 00:15:30.962
Flazzard: You don't think
your Princess is safe

00:15:30.995 --> 00:15:33.499
being frozen, do you?!

00:15:33.533 --> 00:15:35.136
I hope not...

00:15:35.169 --> 00:15:37.474
Because unfortunately,

00:15:37.508 --> 00:15:42.416
her life force is being
drained as I'm speaking to you!

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:47.093
Flazzard: Your Princess's
life ends tomorrow at sundown!

00:15:47.127 --> 00:15:49.999
Flazzard: Hurry
on back! I miss you!

00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:51.268
Leona could die?!

00:15:51.301 --> 00:15:54.274
No, that's not going
to happen - Flazzard!

00:15:55.611 --> 00:15:57.079
[shrieking]

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.386
Popp: Get real!

00:16:01.254 --> 00:16:05.296
I'm not gonna be
dragging anyone down!

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:09.071
Matoriv: Unless you defeat
Flazzard by sundown tomorrow,

00:16:09.104 --> 00:16:11.743
the Princess's life
force will be drained

00:16:11.776 --> 00:16:14.147
by the Forbidden Magic ice.

00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:18.456
But charging in during the day
is just what the enemy wants.

00:16:18.489 --> 00:16:20.459
We strike tonight, then.

00:16:21.662 --> 00:16:24.500
Light the fuse, and
in five seconds... Boom!

00:16:24.535 --> 00:16:27.440
We only have two, so we'll
have to be careful with them.

00:16:27.474 --> 00:16:31.549
I guess we'll just have to
use the ugly bombs after all.

00:16:31.583 --> 00:16:32.785
If these don't work,

00:16:32.818 --> 00:16:35.423
we'll have to destroy the spires
by sword or magic, won't we?

00:16:35.456 --> 00:16:38.295
What are you saying?!
I made them myself!

00:16:38.328 --> 00:16:41.201
They should be
completely foolproof!

00:16:41.234 --> 00:16:43.707
Maam [thought]: Yeah...
That's why we're worried.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.646
How are we going to get
back to Valge island, though?

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.583
Our Balloon Ship
has been lost.

00:16:48.617 --> 00:16:52.490
I have a small boat that
I sometimes use for fishing.

00:16:52.524 --> 00:16:55.296
I can fly it across
with my magic for you,

00:16:55.329 --> 00:16:57.233
just above the
surface of the ocean.

00:16:57.267 --> 00:16:59.204
That'll get us
over the whirlpool.

00:16:59.237 --> 00:17:03.112
Indeed. But the boat
can only hold four of you.

00:17:03.145 --> 00:17:05.751
Then it's me, and Maam,
and I guess...

00:17:05.784 --> 00:17:09.758
Well me, of course! I mean
I built the bombs, didn't I?

00:17:09.792 --> 00:17:11.462
Of course I'm coming with!

00:17:11.495 --> 00:17:12.565
And I'll go, too!

00:17:12.598 --> 00:17:14.500
Fighting to serve
and protect the Princess

00:17:14.535 --> 00:17:18.008
is exactly what the Papnica
Troika were destined to do!

00:17:18.042 --> 00:17:19.712
Apollo: Wait, Amy...

00:17:22.316 --> 00:17:24.956
Apollo, you shouldn't
be moving yet!

00:17:24.989 --> 00:17:29.364
Apollo: I cannot let Dai and
his friends carry our burden.

00:17:29.398 --> 00:17:31.536
I shall go in your stead.

00:17:31.569 --> 00:17:32.838
No. I'll do it.

00:17:32.872 --> 00:17:34.809
Popp: Hold on a
second, you two.

00:17:34.843 --> 00:17:36.244
[surprised breaths]

00:17:36.277 --> 00:17:39.552
The fourth seat
is already taken.

00:17:39.585 --> 00:17:41.689
Both: You're back!

00:17:41.723 --> 00:17:42.925
Sorry for the wait.

00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:46.398
I had a hard time getting a
clear image of Matoriv's cave.

00:17:46.431 --> 00:17:49.304
I made it to the Papnica
temple with my new Zoom spell,

00:17:49.337 --> 00:17:51.241
but from there
it was a real pain

00:17:51.274 --> 00:17:53.746
and it took me a
while to find you all.

00:17:57.353 --> 00:18:00.225
But, hey... I made
it back, didn't I?

00:18:01.563 --> 00:18:05.202
Good work. You'll be
the fourth, then.

00:18:12.183 --> 00:18:15.256
All right. Nothing beats
Maam's Midheal spell!

00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:17.961
This is the last help
you'll get from me.

00:18:17.994 --> 00:18:20.066
It'd be easy with
a Zoom spell,

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:22.771
but I've never actually
been on that island.

00:18:22.805 --> 00:18:24.408
So instead we'll
have Popp do it,

00:18:24.441 --> 00:18:26.746
he'll take you to
the top of Valge Tower

00:18:26.779 --> 00:18:28.249
inside the curse field.

00:18:28.282 --> 00:18:29.652
You've helped plenty, Uncle.

00:18:29.685 --> 00:18:32.658
Thank you for everything,
Matoriv, really.

00:18:32.692 --> 00:18:35.731
Matoriv: Save the thanks
for when you win, dummy.

00:18:35.764 --> 00:18:37.300
We'll make you proud.

00:18:37.334 --> 00:18:39.337
Baduck: Everybody aboard!

00:18:42.077 --> 00:18:43.045
Listen...

00:18:43.078 --> 00:18:44.414
If we survive all this,

00:18:44.447 --> 00:18:47.020
then I'd like to continue
my training with you.

00:18:47.053 --> 00:18:49.257
Because if I quit
after all of that,

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.395
it would look like
I just ran off.

00:18:51.428 --> 00:18:53.265
Like I'd let you run.

00:18:53.298 --> 00:18:56.740
I'm still nowhere near
finished with you, young mage.

00:18:56.773 --> 00:18:58.208
Okay!

00:18:58.241 --> 00:18:59.278
Later, Mentor!

00:18:59.311 --> 00:19:01.047
So he's your "Mentor," now?

00:19:01.081 --> 00:19:04.087
Well, Avan is my one
and only master.

00:19:04.121 --> 00:19:06.726
A mentor and master
are different!

00:19:06.759 --> 00:19:08.797
Why are you splitting hairs?

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.265
Now, here we go.

00:19:12.136 --> 00:19:15.175
When did Gomechan
sneak on board with us?

00:19:21.723 --> 00:19:24.161
[screaming]

00:19:24.194 --> 00:19:25.396
May they go forth

00:19:25.429 --> 00:19:28.235
with the blessing of
the great gods of Papnica.

00:19:28.268 --> 00:19:31.341
Be careful, young
Disciples of Avan.

00:19:31.375 --> 00:19:33.345
[thrilled shouting]

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:35.449
This is amazing!

00:19:35.483 --> 00:19:38.657
We're going to make it to the
island in no time, aren't we?!

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:42.263
I guess they don't call him
the Grand Sorcerer for nothing!

00:19:44.969 --> 00:19:48.008
Hey, guys? So, I was
just thinking...

00:19:48.041 --> 00:19:49.545
How do we stop?

00:19:50.914 --> 00:19:52.149
Amy: Is something wrong?

00:19:52.183 --> 00:19:56.091
Matoriv: I might have forgotten
to tell them how to slow down.

00:19:56.125 --> 00:20:00.166
[alarmed screaming]

00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:01.503
What do we do?!

00:20:01.536 --> 00:20:03.438
I don't know! Don't ask me!

00:20:03.472 --> 00:20:06.311
We're gonna crash! We're gonna
crash! We're gonna crash!

00:20:06.344 --> 00:20:07.748
[worried chirping]

00:20:07.781 --> 00:20:08.816
Woosh!

00:20:11.154 --> 00:20:12.625
That's it!
A Woosh spell brake!

00:20:12.658 --> 00:20:14.862
Well - then cast a Woosh,
why don't you?!

00:20:14.895 --> 00:20:17.601
Don't you have Woosh
in your Magic Bullet Gun?!

00:20:17.634 --> 00:20:20.173
Baduck: Cast it!
Cast it! Cast it!

00:20:20.206 --> 00:20:21.942
Woosh!

00:20:30.392 --> 00:20:32.163
Come on, Mentor.

00:20:32.196 --> 00:20:34.067
[pained groans]

00:20:34.101 --> 00:20:35.403
He talks a big game,

00:20:35.436 --> 00:20:37.507
but he always screws
up where it counts!

00:20:37.541 --> 00:20:41.549
But I tried to cast a Woosh,
and... it really worked!

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:43.587
Dai: Let's split up.

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:46.626
I'll take the Dark
Flame Spire with Baduck.

00:20:46.659 --> 00:20:47.561
Baduck: Right.

00:20:47.594 --> 00:20:49.464
Then Maam and I will
take the Ice Spire.

00:20:49.497 --> 00:20:51.034
Once the Spires are destroyed

00:20:51.068 --> 00:20:52.605
and Flazzard's
curse field is down,

00:20:52.638 --> 00:20:54.908
we charge into Valge Tower!

00:20:58.215 --> 00:21:01.556
Right, sorry. You come
with us, Gomechan.

00:21:01.589 --> 00:21:02.657
[chirp]

00:21:03.058 --> 00:21:04.361
Okay, good luck.

00:21:04.394 --> 00:21:06.031
Dai: Stay safe, you two!

00:21:06.064 --> 00:21:09.471
Zaboera: [cackle]

00:21:09.505 --> 00:21:11.576
Oh, look!
Here they come.

00:21:11.609 --> 00:21:14.882
The sad little flies
in the spider's web.

00:21:14.915 --> 00:21:19.992
Mystvearn? Tell me, are your
soldiers ready for action?

00:21:28.944 --> 00:21:33.218
[cackling]

00:21:33.251 --> 00:21:37.493
[devious laughter]

00:23:37.801 --> 00:23:40.338
Narrator: After they've split
up to topple the Dark Spires,

00:23:40.372 --> 00:23:41.775
Dai and his friends
find themselves

00:23:41.809 --> 00:23:43.980
ensnared in a
vicious attack.

00:23:44.014 --> 00:23:47.086
And with the full force of the
Dark Army raining down on them,

00:23:47.119 --> 00:23:50.660
it seems as if Lord Hadlar
might get his revenge...

00:23:50.694 --> 00:23:52.897
But when our heroes
fall into peril,

00:23:52.931 --> 00:23:56.270
an unexpected
visitor intervenes.

00:23:56.304 --> 00:23:58.242
Learn their
identity next time on

00:23:58.275 --> 00:24:00.714
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:00.747 --> 00:24:02.851
"The Death-Defying Savior".
