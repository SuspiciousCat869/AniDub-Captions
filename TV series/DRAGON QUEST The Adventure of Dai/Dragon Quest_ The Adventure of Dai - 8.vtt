WEBVTT

00:01:52.157 --> 00:01:53.994
Hey! Dai! Popp!

00:01:54.028 --> 00:01:55.397
I'm coming with you!

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:57.267
Maam: Alright, you two.

00:01:57.301 --> 00:01:59.773
If you're both disciples
of Avan, then so am I.

00:01:59.807 --> 00:02:04.181
That makes me your senior.
So if he's gone...

00:02:04.215 --> 00:02:07.622
I'm going to carry on
his will and fight, too.

00:02:09.058 --> 00:02:10.261
Maam?

00:02:10.294 --> 00:02:12.431
So she knows. Did you...

00:02:14.737 --> 00:02:17.542
You can tell me on the
walk to Romos Castle, okay?

00:02:17.575 --> 00:02:21.182
I get the feeling
she's gonna boss us around?

00:02:21.215 --> 00:02:23.754
Relax. That means
she's reliable.

00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:26.794
Dai: C'mon buddy!

00:02:26.827 --> 00:02:29.833
Gomechan: [happy chirp]

00:02:40.053 --> 00:02:41.189
There it is.

00:02:41.222 --> 00:02:43.292
Maam: Just like I said.

00:02:45.263 --> 00:02:47.602
Romos Castle; here we come!

00:02:48.704 --> 00:02:50.206
[terrified yell]

00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:51.610
Guard: Go home.

00:02:51.644 --> 00:02:54.081
The king's already gone
to sleep for the night.

00:02:54.114 --> 00:02:55.819
Come back and try
again tomorrow.

00:02:55.852 --> 00:02:57.454
Come on! Don't be like that.

00:02:57.488 --> 00:02:59.827
We've traveled
so far to get here.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.429
I'm sorry, but the security

00:03:01.462 --> 00:03:03.567
around the whole castle
has been increased

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.974
due to all these monster
attacks we've been having.

00:03:07.007 --> 00:03:08.343
There's no way we can allow

00:03:08.376 --> 00:03:10.982
just anyone to waltz
in here after dark.

00:03:11.015 --> 00:03:15.391
Listen, I get it, but we happen
to know the king personally.

00:03:15.424 --> 00:03:17.696
You don't want to
get in trouble, do you?

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:20.802
Keep up with the lies
and I'll throw you in prison.

00:03:20.835 --> 00:03:22.505
Now get lost!

00:03:24.108 --> 00:03:25.611
Ah, damnit.

00:03:25.645 --> 00:03:29.218
I was so sure we'd get
some castle hospitality.

00:03:29.252 --> 00:03:30.522
Whatever. Could be worse.

00:03:30.555 --> 00:03:33.026
Why don't we just
spend tonight at an inn.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.796
Aha!

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:35.998
Maam: There's one.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.537
Good evening.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.809
It's fairly late for you
folks to be out, isn't it?

00:03:40.842 --> 00:03:41.810
Uh, sir?

00:03:41.844 --> 00:03:43.881
The three of us would
like to spend the night.

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:46.018
It's just you three?

00:03:46.052 --> 00:03:48.322
Aren't there any
adults with you?

00:03:48.356 --> 00:03:50.394
Popp: Mister,
we may not look it,

00:03:50.427 --> 00:03:53.066
but we're warriors
fighting the Dark Army.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.468
Oh.

00:03:54.503 --> 00:03:58.343
Not to brag, but you could
even say we're a Hero's party.

00:03:58.377 --> 00:04:00.515
Why, that's a coincidence.

00:04:00.548 --> 00:04:01.651
Innkeeper: It just so happens

00:04:01.684 --> 00:04:04.623
there's another
Hero's party staying here.

00:04:04.656 --> 00:04:05.457
What an honor.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.063
Wow! Another Hero? Really?!

00:04:08.096 --> 00:04:09.331
There.

00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:10.634
Innkeeper:
That's their room.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.110
Leave them be, Dai.
Save it for tomorrow!

00:04:15.144 --> 00:04:17.481
Oh, come on.
I just want to say hello.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.222
Dai: Hero?
Mister Hero!

00:04:21.256 --> 00:04:23.260
Deroline: What? It's late.

00:04:23.293 --> 00:04:25.899
I know, but I really
wanted to meet you!

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:26.934
Deroline: Go home.

00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:29.405
We're exhausted from
battling monsters all day.

00:04:29.438 --> 00:04:31.811
Y'know... Hero stuff.

00:04:31.844 --> 00:04:33.914
Give us a break, huh?

00:04:33.947 --> 00:04:36.687
Can't I even talk to
you for a little bit?

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.159
Deroline: No! Come back tomorrow
and I'll sign an autograph.

00:04:40.193 --> 00:04:42.164
Zulbon: What's going on?
Who is that?

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:44.201
Deroline: I dunno,
some annoying brat.

00:04:44.235 --> 00:04:46.372
I've heard that
voice before...

00:04:46.405 --> 00:04:49.178
Mister Hero?
Hey, Mister Hero!

00:04:49.211 --> 00:04:52.618
Enough! Buzz off!

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:55.257
It's you! The fake Hero!

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.062
Th-Th-The monster boy?

00:04:58.095 --> 00:04:59.164
Huh? The what?

00:04:59.197 --> 00:05:00.300
[shocked yells]

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:02.839
What are you doing
in the Romos Kingdom?

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:05.945
What's going on, Dai?!

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.853
These guys are villains
pretending to be Heroes!

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.426
Dai: They kidnapped Gomechan,

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:17.434
and I've seen them do all
sorts of other bad stuff.

00:05:17.468 --> 00:05:20.741
Hold on - that's all in
the past. We've changed!

00:05:20.774 --> 00:05:21.576
That's right.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.013
We've atoned for our sins

00:05:23.046 --> 00:05:26.286
and now we're all putting in
the work to become true Heroes.

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:29.358
Oh yeah? Working by
doing what, exactly?

00:05:29.392 --> 00:05:31.395
We defeat weaker monsters,

00:05:31.428 --> 00:05:34.234
and sometimes people give
us rewards in exchange.

00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:36.139
And open leftover
treasure chests

00:05:36.172 --> 00:05:38.376
at castles the
Dark Army's cleared out.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:39.779
When we're not doing that,

00:05:39.813 --> 00:05:41.784
coaching the king's
soldiers in magic

00:05:41.817 --> 00:05:44.789
and fighting skills
pays pretty well, too!

00:05:44.822 --> 00:05:45.725
That's right!

00:05:45.758 --> 00:05:48.062
[proud laughter]

00:05:48.095 --> 00:05:49.464
Dai: Seriously?

00:05:50.735 --> 00:05:53.473
That's basically the same kind
of stuff you guys used to do.

00:05:53.507 --> 00:05:54.876
You said it, Dai.

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:58.116
How could anyone who only
fights the weaker monsters

00:05:58.149 --> 00:05:59.819
call themselves a Hero?

00:05:59.852 --> 00:06:02.725
You're one to talk,
aren't you?

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:06.098
So... Why don't we let
bygones be bygones, huh?

00:06:06.132 --> 00:06:09.404
[laughing]

00:06:14.515 --> 00:06:17.288
Crocodine [thought]: From
here on, I must be ruthless.

00:06:17.321 --> 00:06:20.159
The pride and honor of
a warrior's title

00:06:20.193 --> 00:06:22.832
is meaningless
without victory.

00:06:30.882 --> 00:06:34.756
I will use whatever
method it takes...

00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.795
And crush him.

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:41.670
[roaring]

00:06:47.314 --> 00:06:56.967
[charging roars]

00:06:58.704 --> 00:07:00.942
Come out and face me, Dai!

00:07:00.975 --> 00:07:04.983
Crocodine: Otherwise,
the Romos Kingdom falls today!

00:07:10.995 --> 00:07:12.565
Hey, that voice...

00:07:13.501 --> 00:07:19.345
[roaring]

00:07:19.378 --> 00:07:22.586
Popp: A massive
army of monsters?!

00:07:22.619 --> 00:07:25.491
This has got to be
Crocodine's Furfang Legion.

00:07:25.525 --> 00:07:28.462
They're launching
an all-out attack now?

00:07:28.496 --> 00:07:30.199
Hey! What's with
all the noise?!

00:07:30.233 --> 00:07:32.404
It's the Dark Army's
Furfang Legion!

00:07:32.438 --> 00:07:33.439
[whimpers]

00:07:33.473 --> 00:07:34.909
The Furfang Legion?

00:07:34.943 --> 00:07:38.951
No one has ever seen an army of
monsters that big and ferocious!

00:07:38.984 --> 00:07:39.919
[noticing gasp]

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:42.825
Maam: There's Crocodine!

00:07:42.858 --> 00:07:46.833
Go forth! Destroy Romos Castle!

00:07:47.535 --> 00:07:48.771
It's Crocodine.

00:07:48.804 --> 00:07:51.776
What in the world
is that thing?

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.947
They're headed
for the castle.

00:07:59.926 --> 00:08:00.961
Dai - wait!

00:08:00.995 --> 00:08:02.030
Maam: Dai!

00:08:15.356 --> 00:08:16.325
Your Majesty!

00:08:16.358 --> 00:08:17.094
What is it?

00:08:17.127 --> 00:08:17.928
Soldier: Not good.

00:08:17.962 --> 00:08:19.799
The enemy army
is overwhelming us.

00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:22.003
We can't fend them
off much longer!

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.847
Your Majesty; our only
option is to escape.

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:29.686
I will not abandon
my people and flee.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.291
A king's desertion
is equal to defeat.

00:08:32.324 --> 00:08:33.794
I may be old and weak,

00:08:33.827 --> 00:08:37.100
but I am not about
to turn tail and run.

00:08:37.134 --> 00:08:38.537
King Romos: We must fight!

00:08:38.571 --> 00:08:40.674
We must hold out
hope until the end.

00:08:40.707 --> 00:08:44.047
The gods offer no miracles
to those who retreat.

00:08:48.857 --> 00:08:50.393
King Romos: Who goes there?

00:08:50.427 --> 00:08:54.802
Crocodine: I am Commander of the
Dark Army's Furfang Legion...

00:08:56.305 --> 00:08:58.109
I am Crocodine!

00:08:58.977 --> 00:09:00.279
Cursed creature!

00:09:04.255 --> 00:09:05.558
Crocodine: King Romos.

00:09:05.591 --> 00:09:09.566
I have no interest in
your pathetic little life.

00:09:09.599 --> 00:09:11.268
But you are the perfect bait

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:14.007
with which to lure
out my target.

00:09:16.145 --> 00:09:18.617
We have to go after Dai
- like, right now.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.286
But - why?!
It's safe here!

00:09:20.319 --> 00:09:22.559
Didn't you see
Crocodine's face?!

00:09:22.592 --> 00:09:24.261
He wants revenge on Dai.

00:09:24.294 --> 00:09:25.732
That must be why he's here.

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:27.400
We have to help fight, okay?

00:09:27.434 --> 00:09:29.338
Great. Count us out.

00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:30.775
Indeed.

00:09:30.808 --> 00:09:33.581
What's the point in fighting
someone you know you can't beat?

00:09:33.614 --> 00:09:35.483
That's a fool's errand.

00:09:35.518 --> 00:09:36.820
Zulbon: There's
no greater treasure

00:09:36.853 --> 00:09:39.358
than one's own life,
after all.

00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:40.293
[nervous chuckle]

00:09:40.327 --> 00:09:42.599
You bet. I can
agree with that.

00:09:42.632 --> 00:09:45.738
Please, stop goofing
around! We gotta go!

00:09:45.771 --> 00:09:49.044
But what'll I do?
Crocodine's really powerful.

00:09:49.077 --> 00:09:52.083
Popp: It'll be like
just going to die, you know?

00:09:52.117 --> 00:09:54.790
That is exactly why
we have to help!

00:09:54.823 --> 00:09:56.593
Dai might not make it.

00:09:56.626 --> 00:09:59.097
Maam: We all need
to work together.

00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:02.037
Just don't worry about it.
Trust me on this.

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:04.609
Dai is super
strong in a pinch.

00:10:04.643 --> 00:10:06.378
Popp: He won't lose.

00:10:07.247 --> 00:10:08.683
Popp...

00:10:12.892 --> 00:10:14.529
C'mon. What's with you?

00:10:14.563 --> 00:10:16.566
Aren't you supposed
to be his friend?

00:10:16.599 --> 00:10:17.702
His companion?

00:10:17.736 --> 00:10:19.506
Don't you care about him?!

00:10:19.539 --> 00:10:20.574
Lay off me!

00:10:20.607 --> 00:10:21.376
You know what?

00:10:21.409 --> 00:10:22.645
I never even wanted to

00:10:22.678 --> 00:10:25.216
go up against the Dark Army
in the first place!

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:29.057
I didn't ask for this
dumb fight, alright?!

00:10:29.091 --> 00:10:33.601
Popp: I mean, I know Dai and
I trained together and all.

00:10:33.634 --> 00:10:35.203
But don't you see?

00:10:35.236 --> 00:10:39.044
He's the reason
they keep coming, Maam.

00:10:39.077 --> 00:10:42.417
Popp: I don't want to end
up dead because of him.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:44.922
[pained grunt]

00:10:47.562 --> 00:10:51.769
Ow-ow-ouch. Why, you-

00:10:57.748 --> 00:11:00.386
Maam: Popp...
Did you...

00:11:01.623 --> 00:11:06.131
Did you learn nothing
from our Master Avan?

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:09.639
Maam: I thought you and Dai
were fighting to avenge him.

00:11:09.673 --> 00:11:11.977
Aren't you one
of his students?

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:15.316
Because I am. That's why
I followed you two.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.755
And that's why we're here!

00:11:19.759 --> 00:11:21.395
Maam, I, uh...

00:11:21.428 --> 00:11:23.432
You disgust me!

00:11:25.538 --> 00:11:27.073
[chirping]

00:11:44.441 --> 00:11:51.789
[fighting grunts]

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.435
[roaring]

00:12:01.577 --> 00:12:02.477
Dai: Stop!

00:12:03.246 --> 00:12:04.347
I'm the one you want.

00:12:04.381 --> 00:12:06.051
That boy... It can't be...

00:12:06.084 --> 00:12:08.891
Crocodine: There you are,
Dai. I've been waiting.

00:12:08.924 --> 00:12:11.530
King Romos [thought]:
Is that really Dai?

00:12:11.563 --> 00:12:13.366
He's grown up so much!

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:18.142
The gods have granted me a
miracle in the nick of time!

00:12:18.644 --> 00:12:20.247
Zaboera: [cackling]

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.454
Now fight to your heart's
content, Crocodine!

00:12:24.487 --> 00:12:26.225
With that ace up your sleeve,

00:12:26.258 --> 00:12:29.464
the boy could never
possibly defeat us.

00:12:36.145 --> 00:12:40.921
What's wrong?
Fight me! Otherwise...

00:12:44.328 --> 00:12:45.731
Okay.

00:12:45.764 --> 00:12:47.367
[battle cry]

00:12:50.106 --> 00:12:51.242
Frizz!

00:12:51.275 --> 00:12:52.511
A spell?

00:13:04.034 --> 00:13:05.571
Crocodine [thought]:
In our last battle,

00:13:05.604 --> 00:13:07.975
Dai could only use a sword.

00:13:08.008 --> 00:13:09.946
How did he master
a Frizz spell

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.150
in only a few days?

00:13:16.125 --> 00:13:18.597
Crocodine [thought]: They say
that it only takes three days

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.768
for a warrior to evolve,

00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:22.938
and he actually did it.

00:13:22.972 --> 00:13:26.546
If he continues to grow,
his power could become

00:13:26.579 --> 00:13:31.254
the greatest threat the
Dark Army has ever faced.

00:13:31.288 --> 00:13:31.990
Maam: Dai!

00:13:32.023 --> 00:13:33.459
Soldier: Your Majesty!

00:13:33.493 --> 00:13:35.463
Maam, the king
needs a Midheal.

00:13:35.496 --> 00:13:36.966
Yeah - you got it!

00:13:39.271 --> 00:13:40.908
[cackling]

00:13:40.941 --> 00:13:42.945
That's it, Crocodine...

00:13:42.978 --> 00:13:47.588
Zaboera: Throw away your
pitiful pride and use it!

00:13:47.621 --> 00:13:48.824
Zaboera's soldier:
Master Zaboera,

00:13:48.857 --> 00:13:53.432
what sort of secret weapon
is inside that box?

00:13:53.465 --> 00:13:58.042
Zaboera: It contains that
boy's greatest weakness.

00:13:58.075 --> 00:14:00.781
It looks like you have
left me no choice...

00:14:00.814 --> 00:14:02.417
Crocodine: But to use this!

00:14:07.093 --> 00:14:08.930
That's a Magic Cylinder!

00:14:08.963 --> 00:14:11.836
Magic Cylinder?

00:14:11.869 --> 00:14:14.876
Dai: It can hold
living creatures.

00:14:14.909 --> 00:14:17.815
You can bring them
in or out with a spell!

00:14:17.848 --> 00:14:19.919
Right. It's sort of
like the Magic Bullets

00:14:19.953 --> 00:14:21.589
that Master Avan
used to make?

00:14:21.622 --> 00:14:24.494
Yeah! He must contain some
sort of backup in there.

00:14:24.528 --> 00:14:25.664
I'm sure of it!

00:14:27.668 --> 00:14:29.905
Go! Gush!

00:14:38.455 --> 00:14:39.892
Grampa Brass?!

00:14:46.072 --> 00:14:48.810
Zaboera: Brass may be
Dai's adoptive parent,

00:14:48.844 --> 00:14:51.617
but he's still
a Lump Shaman.

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:52.985
If he leaves his island

00:14:53.018 --> 00:14:55.891
and falls under the
Dark King's Magic Power,

00:14:55.925 --> 00:14:59.364
then he becomes a vanguard
for the Dark Army.

00:14:59.397 --> 00:15:00.601
Destroy him.

00:15:00.634 --> 00:15:02.538
Now, Lump Shaman Brass!

00:15:04.341 --> 00:15:05.544
But, how?

00:15:06.913 --> 00:15:07.915
That monster!

00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:09.919
Dai: Hold on! Wait!

00:15:09.952 --> 00:15:11.823
You can't. That's my Grampa!

00:15:11.856 --> 00:15:13.192
What are you talking about?!

00:15:13.226 --> 00:15:16.767
He raised me after I washed
up on Dermline Island!

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.170
Dai: He's not a bad monster!

00:15:19.204 --> 00:15:21.308
Please, guys - just wait!

00:15:21.341 --> 00:15:24.447
Zaboera: Dai cannot harm
his adoptive parent.

00:15:24.481 --> 00:15:28.957
There's no one better to use
against that would-be Hero.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.662
[devious chuckle]

00:15:34.502 --> 00:15:35.704
Fuddle!

00:15:38.977 --> 00:15:40.714
Hey! Are you okay?

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:51.770
[terrified yelp]

00:15:51.803 --> 00:15:52.905
What's going on?!

00:15:52.938 --> 00:15:55.577
He had Fuddle cast on him.
He's confused.

00:15:56.913 --> 00:15:57.981
Hold him down!

00:15:58.015 --> 00:15:58.817
Yes, sir!

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:01.756
[evil chuckle]

00:16:01.789 --> 00:16:04.060
Let go! Let go!

00:16:04.093 --> 00:16:05.430
Grampa, stop it!

00:16:05.463 --> 00:16:07.768
Why are you doing this?
What's wrong?

00:16:14.748 --> 00:16:16.787
Grampa! You've gotta wake up.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.523
Don't you recognize me?!

00:16:18.557 --> 00:16:20.426
[growling]

00:16:20.459 --> 00:16:21.662
[painted grunt]

00:16:32.718 --> 00:16:34.121
[happy chuckle]

00:16:34.154 --> 00:16:35.757
Brass: Try again!

00:16:40.935 --> 00:16:42.203
Grampa...

00:16:43.773 --> 00:16:45.409
Brass: D-Dai...

00:16:46.746 --> 00:16:48.315
Grampa!

00:16:50.052 --> 00:16:51.454
Brass: Frizzle!

00:16:52.858 --> 00:16:56.064
[pained cry]

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:00.574
Heyedra: Lord Hadlar...

00:17:00.608 --> 00:17:01.543
What now?

00:17:01.576 --> 00:17:04.281
Heyedra: I have received
word from my master,

00:17:04.314 --> 00:17:06.485
Mystic Bishop Zaboera.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.324
He is working with
Commander Crocodine

00:17:09.357 --> 00:17:12.297
of the Furfang Legion
to battle Dai.

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:15.670
He says victory is at hand.

00:17:16.573 --> 00:17:18.610
Understood. Leave me.

00:17:18.643 --> 00:17:20.379
Heyedra: Yes, my lord.

00:17:20.413 --> 00:17:23.553
Zaboera working
with Crocodine?

00:17:29.565 --> 00:17:32.370
Hadlar [thought]:
Curse that wretched Dai.

00:17:32.403 --> 00:17:34.374
He's already grown so strong

00:17:34.407 --> 00:17:37.881
that even Crocodine
can't handle him alone.

00:17:37.915 --> 00:17:40.954
But if Zaboera is
lending his wisdom,

00:17:40.987 --> 00:17:43.693
then I suppose
there's no reason to worry.

00:17:45.363 --> 00:17:48.503
He does have the most
cruel and cunning mind

00:17:48.536 --> 00:17:52.310
out of any of the Dark
Army's Legion Commanders.

00:17:52.343 --> 00:17:55.650
Only a fool would
underestimate him.

00:17:55.684 --> 00:17:58.723
[delighted chuckle]

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:11.650
[evil chuckle]

00:18:11.683 --> 00:18:13.586
G-Grampa...

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.091
King Romos: You'd better
help Dai, young lady.

00:18:16.124 --> 00:18:18.495
I am fine. Don't worry.

00:18:21.869 --> 00:18:23.272
This is the end!

00:18:23.306 --> 00:18:24.107
No!

00:18:27.113 --> 00:18:28.617
It's you again.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.622
Maam: I've got a Frizzle
of my own for you!

00:18:31.655 --> 00:18:32.658
Dai: No - don't!

00:18:32.692 --> 00:18:33.459
But, I...

00:18:33.492 --> 00:18:35.831
Maam, you might hit Grampa!

00:18:35.864 --> 00:18:37.868
I'm trying to save you, Dai!

00:18:37.901 --> 00:18:39.270
Dai: Please...

00:18:39.303 --> 00:18:42.309
He's the only real
family I've got.

00:18:43.045 --> 00:18:44.147
Dai: He's...

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.752
He's my Grampa!

00:18:51.963 --> 00:18:53.766
Now finish him, Brass.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:58.442
Crocodine! How can you
call yourself a warrior?

00:18:58.475 --> 00:19:00.914
Maam: After all
that talk about pride,

00:19:00.948 --> 00:19:04.120
I really thought that you'd
be more honorable than this!

00:19:04.153 --> 00:19:07.226
You think you're the
Beast King? What a joke.

00:19:07.761 --> 00:19:08.964
Soldier: That's right.

00:19:08.997 --> 00:19:12.203
You're seriously using a
hostage against a little boy?

00:19:12.236 --> 00:19:14.341
You're a disgrace
of a warrior.

00:19:14.374 --> 00:19:15.844
You should be ashamed!

00:19:15.877 --> 00:19:16.813
That's right.

00:19:16.846 --> 00:19:17.882
Go home!

00:19:17.915 --> 00:19:19.084
You're no warrior!

00:19:19.117 --> 00:19:22.991
That's enough!

00:19:23.025 --> 00:19:27.467
A warrior without achievement
is like a beast with no teeth!

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.439
Your words are meaningless...

00:19:30.472 --> 00:19:35.917
I've already
abandoned my pride!

00:19:35.951 --> 00:19:37.253
[cackling]

00:19:37.286 --> 00:19:42.363
Perfect. He said it! Oh,
how very well put, Crocodine.

00:19:42.396 --> 00:19:44.936
With that attitude
and my influence,

00:19:44.969 --> 00:19:47.675
your victory is assured.

00:19:47.708 --> 00:19:49.679
Zaboera's soldier:
Impressive, Master Zaboera.

00:19:49.712 --> 00:19:52.349
Turning a Legion
Commander into a pawn.

00:19:52.383 --> 00:19:55.557
Now if Crocodine wins, your
standing is sure to rise

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:58.362
with Lord Hadlar
and the Dark King.

00:19:58.395 --> 00:20:00.299
Zaboera: Of course he'll win.

00:20:00.333 --> 00:20:02.403
With the way I
set all of this up,

00:20:02.437 --> 00:20:06.411
even a muscle-brained buffoon
like Crocodine couldn't lose.

00:20:06.444 --> 00:20:09.450
It will all be
finished soon enough.

00:20:12.057 --> 00:20:13.392
Maam: We need a new plan!

00:20:13.425 --> 00:20:14.895
Dai: The Magic Cylinder.

00:20:14.929 --> 00:20:15.797
Huh?

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:21.542
Dai: If we had that, we could
seal Grampa back inside.

00:20:21.575 --> 00:20:23.445
Maam - you try
to keep him busy,

00:20:23.479 --> 00:20:25.583
and then I'll
go for the Cylinder.

00:20:26.017 --> 00:20:27.386
You got it.

00:20:29.157 --> 00:20:30.593
Frizzle!

00:20:42.852 --> 00:20:43.986
[wincing]

00:20:44.522 --> 00:20:45.858
Crocodine: Ah, too bad.

00:20:45.891 --> 00:20:47.460
A good plan, boy.

00:20:47.493 --> 00:20:49.331
It's a shame your
speed was halved

00:20:49.364 --> 00:20:52.036
by the damage you
took from that Frizzle.

00:20:55.008 --> 00:20:57.046
I-I won't quit!

00:20:58.381 --> 00:21:00.587
Crocodine: It's all over, Dai!

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:03.291
Hang on!

00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:07.467
You won't suffer for long.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.639
In fact, I'll end it now...

00:21:09.672 --> 00:21:13.713
And I'll show you
my most powerful attack!

00:21:16.953 --> 00:21:22.196
[snarling]

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:25.537
[roaring]

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.473
Maam [thought]: He's
gathering all of his energy-

00:21:27.508 --> 00:21:30.246
all of his aura -
into his right arm!

00:21:30.279 --> 00:21:31.516
What's he doing?
