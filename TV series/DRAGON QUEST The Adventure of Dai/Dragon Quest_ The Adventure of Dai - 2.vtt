WEBVTT

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.726
[giggling]

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.830
Are you Dai,
the future Hero?

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:55.632
Yep!

00:01:55.665 --> 00:01:57.301
Oh, boy. You're tiny!

00:01:57.334 --> 00:01:59.973
King Romos sure does
know how to pick 'em.

00:02:00.006 --> 00:02:01.610
[devastated grunt]

00:02:01.643 --> 00:02:03.747
Temjin: The royal
family of Papnica

00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:05.551
has long served the gods.

00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:07.488
And as next in line
for the throne,

00:02:07.522 --> 00:02:10.193
Princess Leona must
complete a ritual during

00:02:10.227 --> 00:02:12.465
the month of her
fourteenth birthday.

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:15.271
It's only after this that
she may inherit the crown

00:02:15.304 --> 00:02:17.407
and become the new
ruler of the kingdom.

00:02:17.441 --> 00:02:20.514
We've heard tell there's an
ancient cave on this island.

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:23.921
But why would you want
to go down there?

00:02:23.955 --> 00:02:26.426
The ritual requires
sacred ground.

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.064
Legend has it,
this is the place.

00:02:29.098 --> 00:02:31.369
But with all the stories
of vicious creatures,

00:02:31.403 --> 00:02:34.141
no one's dared
to come looking.

00:02:34.174 --> 00:02:37.247
It's been fifty years
since our last pilgrimage,

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.154
and we feared we might
have to find another way.

00:02:40.187 --> 00:02:42.457
King Romos told us
of his encounter with

00:02:42.491 --> 00:02:44.261
the creatures of
Dermline Island,

00:02:44.294 --> 00:02:47.368
and was certain his Future
Hero would be keen to help.

00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:49.305
I see. Well, then.

00:02:49.338 --> 00:02:50.641
Dai would be
most honored to

00:02:50.674 --> 00:02:52.745
guide your party
to the Earth Cave.

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:53.547
Huh?

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.752
We appreciate
your hospitality.

00:02:55.785 --> 00:02:58.323
Is it true the beasts
obey Dai's commands?

00:02:58.357 --> 00:03:01.764
Yes... But the cavern is
still a dangerous place.

00:03:01.797 --> 00:03:04.870
Brass: And it's certainly
no place for a princess.

00:03:04.903 --> 00:03:06.039
Varon: Don't worry about her.

00:03:06.072 --> 00:03:07.809
Leona's a Sage in training.

00:03:07.842 --> 00:03:10.748
She's already mastered
quite a number of spells.

00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:13.319
I doubt she'll have
any trouble with a cave.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.892
Grampa...

00:03:15.925 --> 00:03:16.994
I don't wanna.

00:03:17.027 --> 00:03:19.031
She- Well, she's really rude.

00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:21.537
Hey - have respect!

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.042
What he means is,
he'd be glad to help.

00:03:24.075 --> 00:03:26.279
And if he doesn't,
just leave him there.

00:03:26.312 --> 00:03:27.414
Brass: Good luck!

00:03:28.684 --> 00:03:30.387
You better know
where you're going.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.725
I'm not getting lost
because of some little boy.

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:37.869
I could get
there blindfolded.

00:03:37.903 --> 00:03:41.676
I know this island
like the back of my hand!

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.945
Excellent!

00:03:48.122 --> 00:03:50.460
We're almost there...
This way.

00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:56.272
Varon. Take good
care of the girl.

00:03:56.305 --> 00:03:57.875
I understand.

00:04:04.221 --> 00:04:05.524
[terrified cries]

00:04:06.091 --> 00:04:07.027
What's wrong?

00:04:10.968 --> 00:04:12.471
Come on... again?

00:04:12.505 --> 00:04:14.910
Hey, no napping on the path.

00:04:14.943 --> 00:04:16.646
Let's go! Wake up.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.661
Hey, thanks!

00:04:23.694 --> 00:04:26.232
Wow. Amazing!

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:28.136
I'm actually
impressed, little boy.

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.506
My name's Dai!

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.745
So what other special
talents are you hiding?

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:33.814
Any magic?

00:04:35.116 --> 00:04:37.320
Nope. No magic.

00:04:38.256 --> 00:04:40.561
Like... Not one spell?

00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:42.532
Princess?

00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:44.536
Perhaps young Dai here

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:47.274
just hasn't completed
the Rituals of Magic yet.

00:04:47.308 --> 00:04:49.579
Oh, no. I did them.

00:04:51.215 --> 00:04:53.286
Grampa Brass is
training me to be a Mage,

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:54.689
so I've learned the basics,

00:04:54.723 --> 00:04:57.963
but for some reason the
spells just don't work.

00:04:57.996 --> 00:05:01.102
Weird... But the magic
should still be bound to you.

00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:04.976
Yeah, but if I can't wield it,
then what's the difference?

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:07.347
Maybe I don't have the talent.

00:05:10.821 --> 00:05:12.525
Guard: So this
is the Earth Cave?

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:14.095
Guard: How inviting.

00:05:14.128 --> 00:05:15.865
Prepare for the ritual.

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:16.600
Both: Sir!

00:05:16.633 --> 00:05:18.837
Right. I'll scout the area.

00:05:22.546 --> 00:05:23.981
[disappointed sigh]

00:05:26.953 --> 00:05:28.524
Whoa - hey! Uh...

00:05:28.557 --> 00:05:30.728
Here. You can
wield this, right?

00:05:30.761 --> 00:05:32.665
This knife's a
priceless heirloom of

00:05:32.698 --> 00:05:35.036
the royal family
of Papnica.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.007
Temjin gets mad
when I carry it.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.011
But he's kind of always mad.

00:05:43.453 --> 00:05:45.991
Dai: This is incredible.

00:05:49.131 --> 00:05:50.968
If you're no good with magic,

00:05:51.002 --> 00:05:53.741
then you definitely need
a reliable weapon, Dai.

00:05:53.774 --> 00:05:55.878
Now quit moping
and start practicing.

00:05:55.911 --> 00:05:58.984
A good sword won't win
the battle for you.

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:00.755
Oh, gee. Thanks.

00:06:00.788 --> 00:06:03.694
Princess, are you always
this honest with everyone?

00:06:03.727 --> 00:06:07.569
Yep. The truth is
always better for everybody.

00:06:07.602 --> 00:06:09.539
Even if they don't like it.

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:12.812
[laughing]

00:06:12.845 --> 00:06:14.983
It's not like you called me
rude to my face or anything...

00:06:15.016 --> 00:06:18.422
What? Y-you heard that?
That was just, uh-

00:06:18.456 --> 00:06:21.395
[laughing]

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.032
Varon: Gush!

00:06:25.771 --> 00:06:27.440
[screeching]

00:06:28.275 --> 00:06:29.679
[nervous grunts]

00:06:31.917 --> 00:06:33.086
An Evil Scorpion?

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:35.991
Another one of your
friends? Tell it to stop!

00:06:36.025 --> 00:06:39.666
No - that monster definitely
isn't from this island.

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:41.068
Dai: Everyone get away!

00:06:41.102 --> 00:06:42.571
Defend the Princess!

00:06:45.043 --> 00:06:46.111
Like rock...

00:06:46.946 --> 00:06:48.449
[pained grunts]

00:06:50.486 --> 00:06:51.923
[pained grunts]

00:06:52.892 --> 00:06:54.027
Are you okay?!

00:06:55.931 --> 00:06:57.434
Watch your back!

00:06:58.169 --> 00:06:59.137
Sizz!

00:07:04.415 --> 00:07:06.519
But magic always works...

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.523
[pained cry]

00:07:11.195 --> 00:07:12.598
No, Leona!

00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:17.775
Leave her alone!

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.883
[roaring]

00:07:21.917 --> 00:07:25.023
Whoa... Man...
This is some knife.

00:07:25.057 --> 00:07:38.416
[roaring]

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:40.219
Where's your weakness?

00:07:43.426 --> 00:07:44.428
Gotcha!

00:07:44.462 --> 00:07:45.964
[roaring]

00:07:48.336 --> 00:07:51.175
[pained screeching]

00:07:55.217 --> 00:08:00.126
[distressed chirping]

00:08:00.159 --> 00:08:01.696
Princess Leona!

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.378
Dai: Oh, no.
Scorpion venom...

00:08:09.411 --> 00:08:11.750
Even Antidotal
Herbs won't help.

00:08:13.052 --> 00:08:14.221
Dai: Gomechan!

00:08:14.255 --> 00:08:16.158
You'd better head back and
tell Grampa what's happening.

00:08:16.191 --> 00:08:18.664
Squelch is the only healing
spell that might cure her,

00:08:18.697 --> 00:08:20.200
and there's no time to waste.

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:21.503
[understanding chirps]

00:08:29.151 --> 00:08:31.857
Hang on. Help is on the way.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.161
Don't tell me
it's spreading...

00:08:34.194 --> 00:08:35.363
[frustrated groan]

00:08:35.397 --> 00:08:38.169
Dai: Why didn't I take my
magic training more seriously?

00:08:40.541 --> 00:08:41.743
Dai: Varon!

00:08:42.746 --> 00:08:45.216
Just in time! She needs
a Squelch spell, fast!

00:08:46.352 --> 00:08:47.722
Dai: A Magic Cylinder?

00:08:47.755 --> 00:08:49.291
Out of the way...

00:08:51.162 --> 00:08:52.532
I'll make this quick.

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:53.466
[confused breath]

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:54.836
Bang!

00:09:00.782 --> 00:09:02.985
And never come out again!

00:09:05.792 --> 00:09:07.494
Brass: Dai washed
ashore on the island

00:09:07.529 --> 00:09:09.766
when he was only
a few weeks old.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.804
After that, we all
raised him together,

00:09:11.837 --> 00:09:13.607
as if he were one of us.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.476
Everyone here
considers him family.

00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:18.650
[panicked squeaking]

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:19.886
How long ago?

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.859
[chirping]

00:09:22.892 --> 00:09:24.963
Apparently, your
princess is in trouble.

00:09:24.996 --> 00:09:27.568
She's been poisoned
by an evil scorpion!

00:09:27.602 --> 00:09:31.175
I can save her,
but we need to move!

00:09:31.208 --> 00:09:34.749
How did a dangerous monster
like that get onto the island?

00:09:34.782 --> 00:09:37.621
Now... I have a
Squelch spell to cast.

00:09:38.189 --> 00:09:39.491
I'm trying to help!

00:09:39.526 --> 00:09:41.963
I'm afraid we can't
let you do that.

00:09:41.996 --> 00:09:45.303
If you save her, our
expedition will be a waste.

00:09:45.337 --> 00:09:46.840
What are you saying?

00:09:46.874 --> 00:09:49.411
The girl's the last
of her bloodline.

00:09:49.444 --> 00:09:50.447
Once she's gone,

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.817
there are no
more successors

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:54.756
and Papnica Kingdom
will be mine to rule.

00:09:54.789 --> 00:09:58.295
This silly ritual was
always smoke and mirrors.

00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:01.335
And when people ask,

00:10:01.368 --> 00:10:05.076
we can tell them you miserable
creatures were responsible.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:07.515
[cackling]

00:10:07.548 --> 00:10:09.318
Miserable?!
How dare you!

00:10:09.351 --> 00:10:10.721
Traitor!

00:10:11.155 --> 00:10:12.190
Besides you,

00:10:12.223 --> 00:10:14.796
only Varon and my trusted
servants here know...

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.167
And I don't think
you'll tell a soul.

00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:19.104
Frizz!

00:10:19.371 --> 00:10:20.306
Frizz!

00:10:21.242 --> 00:10:23.680
Listen; I need you
to round everybody up.

00:10:23.714 --> 00:10:26.118
We're going to run these
villains off the island.

00:10:26.151 --> 00:10:30.359
[squeaking]

00:10:31.028 --> 00:10:32.898
[roaring]

00:10:36.339 --> 00:10:37.240
What now?

00:10:38.543 --> 00:10:40.647
[pained groan]

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.300
Dai: Come on!

00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:52.104
Not another dead end?!

00:10:52.137 --> 00:10:55.042
[attacking roars]

00:10:55.076 --> 00:10:57.280
[snarling]

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.554
You call yourself
a servant of the gods,

00:11:00.588 --> 00:11:02.390
and yet you'd betray
your own master

00:11:02.423 --> 00:11:04.061
to take the throne
for yourself?

00:11:04.094 --> 00:11:05.296
You're a weasel.

00:11:13.412 --> 00:11:14.414
Gush!

00:11:23.299 --> 00:11:25.002
The Killing Machine!

00:11:25.036 --> 00:11:27.675
But how?! It's impossible!

00:11:27.708 --> 00:11:29.144
The Dark Lord
forged that thing

00:11:29.178 --> 00:11:31.783
so he could destroy
the Hero himself.

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:34.755
Without his essence-
it shouldn't even move!

00:11:34.789 --> 00:11:37.493
Varon: Let me
show you, old fool.

00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:41.101
[chuckling]

00:11:41.135 --> 00:11:44.375
You've conjured a way to
power it using Sage Magic...

00:11:44.408 --> 00:11:45.511
Temjin: That's right...

00:11:45.544 --> 00:11:46.780
Once the Dark Lord fell,

00:11:46.813 --> 00:11:49.451
the machine became a mere
husk of scrap metal.

00:11:49.484 --> 00:11:51.556
But thanks to
my modifications,

00:11:51.589 --> 00:11:53.125
now even the
will of a human

00:11:53.159 --> 00:11:56.331
can control its
terrifying arsenal.

00:11:56.365 --> 00:11:57.836
You've made a grave error.

00:11:57.869 --> 00:12:01.442
Such power...
and nothing will stop you.

00:12:01.475 --> 00:12:03.747
Now... destroy!

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:19.745
[attacking roars]

00:12:22.451 --> 00:12:24.388
Stay back, everybody.

00:12:24.421 --> 00:12:26.191
Frizzle!

00:12:28.597 --> 00:12:29.999
How's that?

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.142
Varon: Pathetic.

00:12:37.013 --> 00:12:39.151
Did you really think
that would work?

00:12:39.184 --> 00:12:41.856
This machine was designed
to withstand Hero Magic.

00:12:41.889 --> 00:12:44.696
Your spells won't
leave a scratch.

00:12:44.729 --> 00:12:47.266
Varon: But me on
the other hand...

00:13:07.241 --> 00:13:08.475
Dai?

00:13:09.912 --> 00:13:11.081
You're awake.

00:13:15.824 --> 00:13:17.360
Where... Are we?

00:13:17.394 --> 00:13:20.534
We're underground somewhere.
Deep inside the Earth cave.

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:23.674
The... Earth cave?

00:13:23.707 --> 00:13:25.912
If I had just been stronger...

00:13:25.945 --> 00:13:27.581
If I could use magic,

00:13:27.615 --> 00:13:30.086
I'd be able to
heal you right here.

00:13:30.119 --> 00:13:33.560
Now I can't even get us
out of this place...

00:13:33.593 --> 00:13:35.898
I... I failed.

00:13:35.931 --> 00:13:37.602
Leona: No, you didn't...

00:13:37.635 --> 00:13:41.810
Did you know that most people
can't even bind with magic?

00:13:41.844 --> 00:13:42.879
Leona: But you can.

00:13:42.912 --> 00:13:44.047
Princess...

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.786
Listen... You saw it yourself.

00:13:46.819 --> 00:13:49.290
Every spell bound with you...

00:13:51.028 --> 00:13:53.399
That means you must
have some talent...

00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:54.969
I still can't use it...

00:13:55.938 --> 00:13:58.442
Not right now,
but keep trying.

00:13:58.476 --> 00:14:02.417
Things just don't happen
overnight with magic.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:03.821
Leona...

00:14:03.854 --> 00:14:06.058
Leona: Now, quit
being such a whiner...

00:14:06.091 --> 00:14:09.230
Or... I'm going to
have to stop liking you.

00:14:09.698 --> 00:14:10.935
Dai: No, Leona!

00:14:10.968 --> 00:14:13.606
Please don't
give in. Wake up!

00:14:17.849 --> 00:14:19.351
Dai: I'll get
you out of here.

00:14:19.384 --> 00:14:22.156
No matter what
it takes - I promise!

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:27.668
You can't die...
I won't let you go!

00:14:28.402 --> 00:14:37.988
[powered-up yell]

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.638
Now what's happening?

00:14:45.671 --> 00:14:47.473
[chuckling]

00:14:53.987 --> 00:14:55.924
Hello, gramps.

00:14:57.629 --> 00:15:00.299
[struggling grunts]

00:15:00.333 --> 00:15:01.669
Goodbye...

00:15:01.702 --> 00:15:03.005
Dai: Stop it!

00:15:03.573 --> 00:15:04.809
Leave him alone.

00:15:04.843 --> 00:15:06.311
Stay back!

00:15:08.716 --> 00:15:11.690
Fool! The princess
is still alive?

00:15:11.723 --> 00:15:12.958
That brat...

00:15:14.461 --> 00:15:16.131
What is this thing?

00:15:16.599 --> 00:15:18.202
Varon: Your doom!

00:15:21.877 --> 00:15:24.549
These cowards are here
to betray the Princess.

00:15:24.582 --> 00:15:27.722
You need to escape with her
- right away, Dai!

00:15:27.755 --> 00:15:29.157
Dai: But we need your help!

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:32.364
The venom's spreading fast.
We're almost out of time here.

00:15:32.397 --> 00:15:34.669
If you don't cast a
Squelch Spell on her,

00:15:34.702 --> 00:15:35.971
she's not going to make it.

00:15:36.004 --> 00:15:37.173
You're right...

00:15:37.206 --> 00:15:39.011
Temjin: Varon! Forget the kid.

00:15:39.044 --> 00:15:41.516
Get rid of the Lump Shaman.

00:15:41.549 --> 00:15:42.585
Once he's gone,

00:15:42.618 --> 00:15:45.222
all we have to do is let
the venom run its course.

00:15:48.764 --> 00:15:50.166
Grampa!

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.238
This is it, old man.
Say your goodbyes.

00:15:55.544 --> 00:16:03.560
[furious roaring]

00:16:05.764 --> 00:16:08.001
Kaswoosh!

00:16:13.613 --> 00:16:16.586
Dai... He cast a spell!

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.122
Are you all right, Grampa?

00:16:18.156 --> 00:16:19.758
What do you think?!

00:16:24.467 --> 00:16:25.971
[chuckling]

00:16:26.004 --> 00:16:28.042
You caught me off-guard.

00:16:28.075 --> 00:16:30.145
Even a Kaswoosh didn't work?!

00:16:31.147 --> 00:16:34.021
Varon: I'm going to destroy...

00:16:34.054 --> 00:16:35.658
all of you!

00:16:35.691 --> 00:16:37.527
Dai: Not on my watch.

00:16:37.561 --> 00:16:40.166
You've already
done enough damage!

00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:44.073
Don't make me laugh, insect!

00:17:05.617 --> 00:17:06.819
[amused cackle]

00:17:06.853 --> 00:17:07.922
Nice try.

00:17:07.955 --> 00:17:10.493
But I promise you,
it's no use.

00:17:10.527 --> 00:17:12.731
Varon: Magic won't
penetrate this machine.

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:13.867
And you lack the strength

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.438
to do any real
damage with that sword.

00:17:16.471 --> 00:17:17.508
You're hopeless.

00:17:17.541 --> 00:17:20.079
I'm going to enjoy
breaking you.

00:17:36.613 --> 00:17:37.514
Dai!

00:17:39.551 --> 00:17:40.820
And checkmate.

00:17:44.127 --> 00:17:46.131
[attacking roar]

00:17:53.847 --> 00:17:55.550
[screaming]

00:17:55.584 --> 00:17:56.652
But, how?!

00:17:56.686 --> 00:17:59.490
The machine's armor is
supposed to be impenetrable!

00:18:00.994 --> 00:18:02.430
Varon: I don't believe it...

00:18:02.464 --> 00:18:05.637
That pesky rat's been hitting
the same spot this whole time!

00:18:07.608 --> 00:18:09.344
Varon: What is that?

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:20.432
No!

00:18:27.915 --> 00:18:29.317
Sizzle!

00:18:31.922 --> 00:18:36.364
[defeated roar]

00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:45.784
Temjin: Impossible...

00:18:45.817 --> 00:18:49.390
No magic has ever pierced
the Dark Lord's machine.

00:18:49.424 --> 00:18:52.765
Brass: Well, for the Bishop
of Papnica, you lack wisdom.

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:54.301
The armor was already pierced,

00:18:54.334 --> 00:18:57.239
so the Sizzle Spell had
nothing in it's way.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:03.152
Grampa...

00:19:03.185 --> 00:19:04.153
The Princess!

00:19:04.187 --> 00:19:05.456
Oh, right.

00:19:07.026 --> 00:19:08.663
Guard: Bishop Temjin!

00:19:08.696 --> 00:19:11.702
What's wrong? We saw
the blast from the ship.

00:19:12.537 --> 00:19:13.305
It's all over.

00:19:13.339 --> 00:19:15.009
You better tell
them the truth.

00:19:15.043 --> 00:19:16.613
Temjin: The truth...

00:19:16.646 --> 00:19:19.417
This feral child
poisoned Princess Leona.

00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:22.223
Leona: That's not how
I remember it, Temjin.

00:19:25.864 --> 00:19:28.503
Are you all right,
Your Highness? Who did this?

00:19:30.874 --> 00:19:32.644
Go ahead. Tell them the truth.

00:19:32.678 --> 00:19:34.381
It might not
make you feel better,

00:19:34.414 --> 00:19:37.420
but I'll enjoy
watching you squirm...

00:19:37.453 --> 00:19:39.090
Plus, it's good
practice for when

00:19:39.123 --> 00:19:41.261
you face the courts back home.

00:19:49.277 --> 00:19:51.381
Leona: Mighty Earth God,
I come before you as

00:19:51.414 --> 00:19:53.953
the successor to
the throne of Papnica.

00:19:53.987 --> 00:19:55.891
I ask for your
blessing to guide me

00:19:55.924 --> 00:19:57.460
as the kingdom's new ruler.

00:19:57.493 --> 00:20:00.667
Awesome. She actually
sounded like a real princess.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.172
She is. Be quiet!

00:20:03.205 --> 00:20:06.211
May our people
thrive in every season.

00:20:11.989 --> 00:20:13.626
[amazed breath]

00:20:16.833 --> 00:20:20.272
I owe you one, Dai.
You saved my life back there.

00:20:20.306 --> 00:20:23.212
Nah... I'm glad I
could help, Your Majesty.

00:20:23.245 --> 00:20:26.084
Same! I told you that
you could do magic.

00:20:26.117 --> 00:20:27.120
Yeah, you did...

00:20:27.153 --> 00:20:28.455
Thanks.

00:20:28.488 --> 00:20:30.594
Well, when you finish your
training to become a Hero,

00:20:30.627 --> 00:20:32.430
come and visit me in Papnica.

00:20:32.463 --> 00:20:35.704
Maybe I'll even let you be
my bodyguard or something.

00:20:35.737 --> 00:20:38.309
Uh... That seems
like a lot of work...

00:20:38.342 --> 00:20:40.212
[amused laughter]

00:20:40.245 --> 00:20:41.749
Dai: See you around, Princess.

00:20:43.285 --> 00:20:44.387
It's "Leona", Dai.

00:20:44.421 --> 00:20:46.559
You don't need to
call me "Princess".

00:20:46.593 --> 00:20:47.494
Oh, but...

00:20:47.528 --> 00:20:48.697
Leona: And if you
ever make the mistake

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.000
of talking to me like
a stranger again...

00:20:51.034 --> 00:20:52.871
I'll throw you
in the dungeon.

00:20:57.814 --> 00:20:58.750
Dai: Bye, Leona!

00:20:58.783 --> 00:21:02.257
Good luck with the kingdom!
Safe travels!

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:03.727
Brass: Now, young man.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.398
What d'ya say...
Will you show me that again?

00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:07.500
Show you what?

00:21:07.534 --> 00:21:09.137
Your Kaswoosh Spell,
of course.

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:10.139
Sure!

00:21:10.172 --> 00:21:12.343
Here goes... Kaswoosh!

00:21:12.377 --> 00:21:14.113
Uh.... Then, Sizzle!

00:21:14.147 --> 00:21:16.652
Brass: You keep
working on it, Dai.

00:21:18.054 --> 00:21:25.369
[panicked cries]

00:21:25.402 --> 00:21:26.472
[worried yell]

00:21:26.506 --> 00:21:29.612
We've got a problem! Master?

00:21:29.645 --> 00:21:32.718
Popp: It's bad...
Really, seriously bad.

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:35.924
A whole ton of monsters just
showed up and hit the harbor.

00:21:35.957 --> 00:21:37.728
Avan: Well, that is a pickle.

00:21:37.762 --> 00:21:38.261
Huh?

00:21:38.295 --> 00:21:39.331
Trouble...

00:21:39.364 --> 00:21:41.669
It means the Dark Lord
has resurrected.

00:21:42.336 --> 00:21:43.305
Okay...

00:21:43.338 --> 00:21:44.775
Well shouldn't we go back and

00:21:44.808 --> 00:21:46.478
help those people
fight 'em off?

00:21:46.512 --> 00:21:47.815
The soldiers can handle them.

00:21:47.848 --> 00:21:50.754
And we have much more
pressing matters at hand.

00:21:50.787 --> 00:21:51.790
Oh...

00:21:51.823 --> 00:21:53.993
The future, Popp.
We need to guard the future.

00:21:54.027 --> 00:21:55.063
I'm lost.

00:21:55.096 --> 00:21:56.765
So is our future Hero.

00:21:56.799 --> 00:22:00.439
And if the Dark Lord has
returned, we must find them.

00:22:00.472 --> 00:22:03.378
