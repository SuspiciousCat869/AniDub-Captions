WEBVTT

00:01:51.924 --> 00:01:54.697
[roaring]

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.401
Dai: I'll draw it
away to give you time!

00:01:57.434 --> 00:01:58.036
Okay...

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:59.371
Come on!

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:13.099
Leona: Everybody - hurry!

00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:19.145
[fleeing cries]

00:02:19.178 --> 00:02:22.151
Gomechan: [concerned chirping]

00:02:22.184 --> 00:02:23.419
What happened?!

00:02:25.691 --> 00:02:27.027
Leona: Oh, no.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.329
We need to help!

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:30.902
Yeah, but...

00:02:30.936 --> 00:02:32.238
Nabara: Hurry it up.

00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:34.274
You can lift a rock,
can't you?

00:02:34.977 --> 00:02:35.978
Go!

00:02:36.011 --> 00:02:37.682
Uh - yes, ma'am!

00:02:43.628 --> 00:02:46.366
Dai [thought]: Dragon scales
are as hard as steel.

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:48.737
But they must have some
kind of weak point!

00:02:56.854 --> 00:02:58.489
Dai: Earth Slash!

00:03:01.295 --> 00:03:02.799
[shocked gasp]

00:03:06.272 --> 00:03:07.809
[pained cry]

00:03:08.578 --> 00:03:09.612
Dai - no!

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:12.518
Crack!

00:03:17.695 --> 00:03:19.933
The whole thing's
tough as steel!

00:03:19.967 --> 00:03:21.570
His sword is broken.

00:03:37.903 --> 00:03:40.641
Popp: I can't win
fighting them one by one.

00:03:42.044 --> 00:03:46.119
For this, I'll need
one huge spell.

00:03:46.152 --> 00:03:48.356
Popp: Mighty spirits
asleep in the earth,

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.995
I ask you now
to hear my voice!

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.311
Donk!

00:04:12.506 --> 00:04:13.974
Yes!

00:04:14.007 --> 00:04:15.343
[falling yell]

00:04:16.847 --> 00:04:17.716
[pained groan]

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:19.318
Ouch...

00:04:20.187 --> 00:04:22.357
Wow. That's a
spell straight from

00:04:22.391 --> 00:04:24.696
Grand Sorcerer
Matoriv for you.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.737
I mean, it used up all of
my Magic Power, but it worked.

00:04:28.771 --> 00:04:30.508
[exhausted chuckle]

00:04:30.975 --> 00:04:33.514
[growling]

00:04:35.751 --> 00:04:37.454
Frizz! Frizz!

00:04:42.465 --> 00:04:44.235
With those puny spells...

00:04:44.268 --> 00:04:45.505
He's never gonna win!

00:04:45.538 --> 00:04:48.043
The sword! You have to
give it to him!

00:04:48.076 --> 00:04:49.345
What are you saying?!

00:04:49.378 --> 00:04:51.048
No way - this thing is mine!

00:04:51.081 --> 00:04:52.818
Dai: [screaming]

00:04:55.892 --> 00:04:59.431
[struggling]

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:00.433
Dai!

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:02.337
[pained groan]

00:05:02.872 --> 00:05:03.941
Over there!

00:05:05.811 --> 00:05:07.648
Zeshin: Dragons!

00:05:09.887 --> 00:05:14.027
Sorry, Princess! You've all
got to get out of here!

00:05:17.902 --> 00:05:19.839
Run?! How can we run?

00:05:20.941 --> 00:05:22.178
We're out of time!

00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:22.879
[screaming]

00:05:22.912 --> 00:05:23.847
Wait!

00:05:26.954 --> 00:05:27.855
[screaming]

00:05:27.888 --> 00:05:29.424
Don't leave me!

00:05:30.327 --> 00:05:31.930
Bunch of cowards.

00:05:32.866 --> 00:05:34.702
[roaring]

00:05:37.642 --> 00:05:38.710
Oh, no...

00:05:39.946 --> 00:05:41.081
Popp: They're done for!

00:05:41.683 --> 00:05:43.419
Leona!

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:53.974
[roaring]

00:05:54.776 --> 00:05:55.778
[shocked gasps]

00:06:12.378 --> 00:06:13.880
Dai - how?

00:06:14.482 --> 00:06:15.785
Nabara: That crest...

00:06:15.818 --> 00:06:17.087
It can't be.

00:06:28.711 --> 00:06:29.646
Boom!

00:06:34.923 --> 00:06:36.326
It's the mark again.

00:06:36.359 --> 00:06:38.496
We've got the advantage now!

00:06:46.045 --> 00:06:47.648
Get them out of here!

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:07.154
Grandmother, is that
crest what I think it is?

00:07:07.188 --> 00:07:08.222
Huh?

00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:13.266
I never thought I would
actually see it for myself...

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.474
The legendary Dragon
Knight in battle!

00:07:41.222 --> 00:07:45.096
Is it me, or is Dai even more
intense than usual today?

00:07:46.733 --> 00:07:47.401
Popp...

00:07:47.434 --> 00:07:48.904
Help us out here, would you?!

00:07:48.937 --> 00:07:49.939
Popp: R-Right!

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.716
Hey!

00:08:21.569 --> 00:08:23.072
[pained roar]

00:08:28.517 --> 00:08:30.621
Zapple!

00:08:47.387 --> 00:08:48.323
[amazed breaths]

00:08:48.356 --> 00:08:49.692
He won.

00:08:50.394 --> 00:08:51.897
O-oh, wow!

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:55.838
Good job, Dai.
That was amazing.

00:08:57.474 --> 00:08:59.345
Hey! Are you okay?

00:08:59.378 --> 00:09:00.714
U-Uh...

00:09:05.089 --> 00:09:06.358
What's wrong?

00:09:06.392 --> 00:09:09.398
I'm scared. He's so scary!

00:09:09.432 --> 00:09:10.768
Huh?

00:09:12.003 --> 00:09:14.207
I'm... scary?

00:09:15.812 --> 00:09:20.219
[frightened chatter]

00:09:20.253 --> 00:09:22.190
Dai: W-Why is everybody...

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.973
Killvearn: Because
you're not human.

00:09:30.006 --> 00:09:34.115
And seeing your inhuman
fighting abilities

00:09:34.148 --> 00:09:36.185
has them all terrified.

00:09:36.218 --> 00:09:37.054
Who's there?

00:09:37.087 --> 00:09:39.992
Killvearn: Humans
can be so selfish.

00:09:40.026 --> 00:09:43.433
Even now, after you've
protected their city.

00:09:43.466 --> 00:09:44.367
[devious chuckle]

00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:45.604
I got you!

00:09:46.807 --> 00:09:48.911
Killvearn: [amused chuckle]

00:09:48.944 --> 00:09:50.080
For me?

00:09:50.113 --> 00:09:50.681
[frightened cries]

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:52.150
Dai: The Dark Army?

00:09:54.689 --> 00:09:57.761
Killvearn: My name
is Killvearn.

00:09:58.964 --> 00:10:04.008
But my rather insulting
friends call me "the Reaper."

00:10:04.041 --> 00:10:05.712
[chuckling]

00:10:05.745 --> 00:10:08.416
Killvearn... the Reaper?

00:10:08.449 --> 00:10:10.521
Dai: Are you the
Dragon Legion Commander?

00:10:10.554 --> 00:10:12.057
[chuckling]

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.428
Killvearn: I'm not
so distinguished.

00:10:14.462 --> 00:10:16.065
I'm just a servant.

00:10:16.098 --> 00:10:18.402
Killvearn: The Dark Army
has been buzzing

00:10:18.436 --> 00:10:21.543
with speculation
about your identity.

00:10:21.577 --> 00:10:23.713
I was sent to learn more,

00:10:23.747 --> 00:10:27.054
so I borrowed a few dragons
from the Dragon Legion.

00:10:27.087 --> 00:10:32.665
And now, as a result, I was able
to see what you really are.

00:10:32.698 --> 00:10:35.236
[chuckling]

00:10:36.438 --> 00:10:38.810
Wait. What do you
mean by that?

00:10:39.513 --> 00:10:40.948
Killvearn: Oh, also,

00:10:40.982 --> 00:10:45.892
the real Dragon Legion Commander
will probably show up soon...

00:10:45.925 --> 00:10:49.098
To lure you into hell.

00:10:49.131 --> 00:10:50.601
Hope you enjoy it.

00:10:50.634 --> 00:10:52.671
[chuckling]

00:10:54.341 --> 00:10:55.878
Leona: He's gone.

00:10:57.615 --> 00:10:59.184
Mr. Gopple: I paid for that!

00:11:01.589 --> 00:11:04.161
Dai: What did he mean by my...

00:11:04.194 --> 00:11:05.864
My identity?

00:11:08.604 --> 00:11:09.806
Hang on.

00:11:09.839 --> 00:11:12.444
You called Dai "the Dragon
Knight," didn't you?

00:11:12.477 --> 00:11:13.780
Indeed.

00:11:13.814 --> 00:11:15.751
Nabara: He must
be the Dragon Knight

00:11:15.785 --> 00:11:19.926
from the legends of our
homeland, the Teran Kingdom.

00:11:19.959 --> 00:11:22.865
Huh? The Dragon Knight?

00:11:22.899 --> 00:11:28.175
Popp: Where's Teran?
And who are you?

00:11:28.208 --> 00:11:30.480
I am Nabara the Seer.
Merle is my granddaughter.

00:11:30.514 --> 00:11:32.652
Teran is to
the north of here.

00:11:32.685 --> 00:11:35.056
They call it
the Mystic Country.

00:11:35.089 --> 00:11:39.832
Dai [thought]: The Mystic
Country. If I go there...

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.469
Hyunckel [thought]:
Sovereign Rock Castle's

00:11:58.504 --> 00:12:00.273
footprints end here.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.247
The Field of Death...

00:12:06.319 --> 00:12:10.126
King Vearn must have the
Dark Army positioned there.

00:12:12.197 --> 00:12:13.265
Who's there?

00:12:17.474 --> 00:12:18.910
Are you all right?

00:12:18.944 --> 00:12:22.217
The... Dark... Army.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:23.353
What?

00:12:23.386 --> 00:12:28.295
They drove my...
homeland of Carl to ruin.

00:12:29.699 --> 00:12:31.503
Hyunckel: Taking
down Carl Kingdom

00:12:31.536 --> 00:12:34.307
couldn't have
been an easy task.

00:12:34.341 --> 00:12:36.211
Which Legion did it?

00:12:41.288 --> 00:12:43.225
Popp: So this is Teran?

00:12:46.165 --> 00:12:47.768
Gorgeous.

00:12:47.802 --> 00:12:51.075
Popp: Yeah, but...
It's kind of folksy.

00:12:51.108 --> 00:12:53.479
More of a village
than a kingdom.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.387
But, you know,

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:01.161
I'm really happy the Dark Army
hasn't attacked this place.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:02.932
Leona: To be blunt,

00:13:02.966 --> 00:13:05.269
it's because it has
no tactical value.

00:13:05.302 --> 00:13:07.675
Teran is a kingdom
by name alone.

00:13:07.709 --> 00:13:10.112
It has no military power.

00:13:10.714 --> 00:13:12.250
Quite right.

00:13:12.851 --> 00:13:14.255
Love for nature,

00:13:14.288 --> 00:13:16.325
Devotion to the gods,
because of these,

00:13:16.358 --> 00:13:20.367
our king forbade the development
of weapons and goods.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.241
He said they would
bring disaster upon us.

00:13:24.275 --> 00:13:29.151
But with a lack of industry, our
country also became weakened.

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:32.424
Everybody prefers a life
filled with luxury.

00:13:32.457 --> 00:13:36.733
Eventually, the population
moved away to find it,

00:13:36.767 --> 00:13:39.705
and this country
was left to rot.

00:13:39.739 --> 00:13:43.112
Now there are only
about fifty people.

00:13:43.145 --> 00:13:46.351
Of course, we were
among those who left.

00:13:46.384 --> 00:13:52.063
But... I still love this...
This quiet little country.

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:55.938
She's rather a strange one.

00:13:55.971 --> 00:13:58.911
Dai: Madam Nabara,
I need you to tell me;

00:13:58.944 --> 00:14:01.048
There's answers out
there about my identity

00:14:01.081 --> 00:14:03.285
and I have to find them!

00:14:04.287 --> 00:14:06.993
What are you so
worked up about, huh?

00:14:07.026 --> 00:14:08.429
I'm not worked up!

00:14:09.532 --> 00:14:10.901
Okay.

00:14:12.604 --> 00:14:13.907
Dai: I'm sorry.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:19.084
But... I have to know, just...
just who I actually am!

00:14:20.387 --> 00:14:21.923
Follow me.

00:14:28.335 --> 00:14:31.943
Popp: Talk about decrepit.
Is this some ruin, or what?

00:14:31.976 --> 00:14:33.278
Look inside.

00:14:35.316 --> 00:14:36.352
Popp: That's...

00:14:36.385 --> 00:14:39.324
That, my boy,
is the crest of the Dragon.

00:14:39.358 --> 00:14:42.463
Is that the symbol that
appears on my forehead?

00:14:42.497 --> 00:14:44.167
Yes. It's identical.

00:14:44.201 --> 00:14:47.207
Teran worships
the God of Dragons.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.712
This crest is
revered and feared

00:14:49.745 --> 00:14:52.751
as a sign of the
God of Dragons' power.

00:14:52.784 --> 00:14:54.120
Legend has it,

00:14:54.154 --> 00:14:58.697
that he who bears this
crest on his forehead is...

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:00.199
The Dragon Knight.

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:02.772
But, what does that mean?

00:15:02.805 --> 00:15:05.009
Merle: That Dai may
not be Human, at all.

00:15:05.042 --> 00:15:06.311
[shocked gasp]

00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:11.121
Merle: We believe it
is a servant of the gods.

00:15:11.155 --> 00:15:12.591
According to the legends,

00:15:12.625 --> 00:15:18.101
the Dragon Knight wields awesome
power and can cast any spell...

00:15:18.135 --> 00:15:22.778
And with the heavens, earth,
and sea as its allies,

00:15:22.812 --> 00:15:26.017
it will destroy
all of creation.

00:15:32.163 --> 00:15:35.035
Who would destroy...
all of creation?

00:15:36.271 --> 00:15:40.246
Nabara: They could be our
savior or our destroyer.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.352
All that is written is
that they shall wield power

00:15:43.386 --> 00:15:46.926
like a reincarnation
of the Dragon God.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.362
However...

00:15:48.395 --> 00:15:50.200
Go on! Tell me!

00:15:50.233 --> 00:15:53.272
Nabara: There is a
forbidden temple which lies

00:15:53.305 --> 00:15:55.276
at the bottom of this lake.

00:15:55.309 --> 00:15:59.450
The soul of the God of
Dragons is said to rest there.

00:16:01.523 --> 00:16:02.859
So, then...

00:16:02.892 --> 00:16:03.994
Indeed.

00:16:04.027 --> 00:16:06.164
If you really are
connected in some way

00:16:06.198 --> 00:16:08.536
to the legend of
the Dragon Knight...

00:16:08.569 --> 00:16:13.178
perhaps you can enter that
temple and see for yourself.

00:16:15.818 --> 00:16:18.055
Dai: I'm going down there.

00:16:18.088 --> 00:16:20.827
An underwater
temple, huh? Okay!

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.230
I'm going alone.

00:16:22.263 --> 00:16:26.740
Huh? But...
shouldn't we all go?

00:16:26.773 --> 00:16:30.045
Dai: No. I'm doing
this myself.

00:16:31.381 --> 00:16:32.752
But, Dai...

00:16:32.785 --> 00:16:37.193
All right. At least take this.
I bought it in Bengarna.

00:16:37.226 --> 00:16:39.531
Dai: Okay. Thanks.

00:16:41.869 --> 00:16:46.580
Dai: I just... I've never
wondered who I am before.

00:16:46.613 --> 00:16:48.917
I washed up on
Dermline Island as a baby

00:16:48.951 --> 00:16:52.290
and was raised
among monsters.

00:16:52.323 --> 00:16:56.364
Grampa Brass was hard on me,
but he really cared.

00:16:57.701 --> 00:16:59.404
The monsters never...

00:16:59.438 --> 00:17:02.778
They never excluded me just
because I wasn't like them.

00:17:02.811 --> 00:17:04.280
[agreeing chirp]

00:17:06.018 --> 00:17:09.291
But humans...
won't accept me unless...

00:17:09.324 --> 00:17:11.394
Unless I am like them.

00:17:13.232 --> 00:17:14.935
Dai: That's why...

00:17:14.969 --> 00:17:17.274
I want to find the truth.

00:17:17.307 --> 00:17:22.350
I... I don't want
you or Leona to hate me!

00:17:22.952 --> 00:17:23.821
Dai!

00:17:23.854 --> 00:17:25.122
Wait!

00:17:25.658 --> 00:17:26.626
Dai!

00:17:33.907 --> 00:17:36.345
You idiot.

00:17:36.378 --> 00:17:39.686
Worrying about things
that don't even matter...

00:17:39.719 --> 00:17:42.256
I thought we were friends...

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.528
I thought we were friends!

00:17:49.572 --> 00:17:53.680
Popp: I don't care if
you're a monster or not.

00:17:54.882 --> 00:17:58.756
That... That never mattered.

00:18:00.927 --> 00:18:02.731
Oh, Popp...

00:18:32.356 --> 00:18:36.498
Dai [thought]: There it is...
The Dragon Temple.

00:18:37.802 --> 00:18:39.571
How do I get inside?

00:18:56.272 --> 00:18:58.175
There's air in here.

00:19:22.525 --> 00:19:24.460
Dragon Crystal:
Who goes there?

00:19:24.494 --> 00:19:25.997
Dragon Crystal:
Name yourself.

00:19:26.031 --> 00:19:27.768
A talking crystal?!

00:19:27.801 --> 00:19:30.139
Dragon Crystal: I am
the Dragon Crystal.

00:19:30.173 --> 00:19:34.280
Guardian of this temple.
Who are you?

00:19:34.313 --> 00:19:36.887
That's what I'm
here to find out!

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.023
Am I a Dragon Knight?

00:19:39.057 --> 00:19:41.328
Dragon Crystal:
Why do you ask this?

00:19:41.361 --> 00:19:46.539
Dai: I don't even know where
I was born, or even who I am.

00:19:46.572 --> 00:19:48.341
Please tell me!

00:19:48.375 --> 00:19:50.747
Dragon Crystal:
There is no mistake.

00:19:50.781 --> 00:19:53.152
You are the Dragon Knight.

00:19:53.185 --> 00:19:54.655
Then... it's true.

00:19:54.688 --> 00:19:56.959
Dragon Crystal: This
temple cannot be entered

00:19:56.992 --> 00:19:59.698
by anyone but
the Dragon Knight.

00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:02.904
Your presence here
is proof itself.

00:20:04.609 --> 00:20:07.915
But what... is
a Dragon Knight?

00:20:07.948 --> 00:20:10.419
A human, or a monster?

00:20:10.453 --> 00:20:12.525
Dragon Crystal:
It is neither.

00:20:12.558 --> 00:20:15.262
Three gods built this world.

00:20:15.295 --> 00:20:18.202
The God of Dragons,
the God of Darklings,

00:20:18.235 --> 00:20:20.574
and the God of Humans.

00:20:20.607 --> 00:20:23.212
The Dragon Knight is
the ultimate creation;

00:20:23.245 --> 00:20:26.317
a vessel that embodies
all three of them.

00:20:26.953 --> 00:20:28.121
Creation?!

00:20:28.155 --> 00:20:32.598
Dragon Crystal: Yes. Long ago,
by those celestial beings.

00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:35.235
Dai: But...
for what purpose?

00:20:35.269 --> 00:20:36.605
Dragon Crystal:
In order to...

00:20:37.741 --> 00:20:39.343
What? What is it?

00:20:39.377 --> 00:20:42.283
Dragon Crystal: Someone else
has entered this temple.

00:20:49.097 --> 00:20:51.302
Dragon Crystal:
This is impossible.

00:20:51.335 --> 00:20:53.472
The Dragon Knight is...

00:20:55.977 --> 00:20:57.012
Who are you?

00:21:03.392 --> 00:21:06.464
I am the Dragon
Legion Commander...

00:21:07.868 --> 00:21:08.936
Baran.

00:21:11.107 --> 00:21:12.042
Dai: Baran?!

00:21:14.481 --> 00:21:17.754
Dai [thought]: This is
the Dragon Legion Commander.

00:21:17.787 --> 00:21:20.293
The real deal!

00:21:20.326 --> 00:21:23.699
And there's...
something about him...

00:21:24.267 --> 00:21:25.904
So, you're Dai.

00:21:25.937 --> 00:21:26.973
That's right!

00:21:27.006 --> 00:21:30.346
Dragon Crystal: This man
is also a Dragon Knight?!

00:21:30.379 --> 00:21:31.749
It cannot be.

00:21:31.782 --> 00:21:35.456
Two Dragon Knights
existing in the same age...

00:21:35.489 --> 00:21:37.828
So, are you here to kill me?

00:21:37.861 --> 00:21:39.832
No, I'm not.

00:21:39.865 --> 00:21:43.105
Baran: The Dragon Crystal
must have already told you

00:21:43.138 --> 00:21:45.777
the truth about your identity.

00:21:47.213 --> 00:21:49.350
And so what if it did?!

00:21:50.419 --> 00:21:53.025
I want your power, Dai.

00:21:53.058 --> 00:21:55.530
Now come and serve me.

00:21:55.564 --> 00:21:58.870
And together we
shall destroy...

00:21:58.903 --> 00:22:01.441
the human world!

00:23:37.868 --> 00:23:39.939
Narrator: The Dragon
Legion Commander, Baran,

00:23:39.972 --> 00:23:42.409
reveals the Dragon
Knight's mission,

00:23:42.443 --> 00:23:44.447
and it's a cruel
blow to Dai's plans

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.484
of defeating the Dark King.

00:23:46.519 --> 00:23:49.625
Our hero counters
with an Avan Strash,

00:23:49.658 --> 00:23:52.797
but it has no effect
on this powerful warrior.

00:23:52.831 --> 00:23:55.870
Soon, Baran reveals
a shocking link.

00:23:56.773 --> 00:23:58.442
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:58.475 --> 00:24:01.047
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.819
"Dragon Master General Baran".
