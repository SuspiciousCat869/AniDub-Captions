WEBVTT

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.415
Listen up!

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:08.791
The Hero has been lost in the
waters near the Field of Death.

00:02:08.825 --> 00:02:12.198
While he may have been
wounded by Lord Hadlar,

00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:14.737
we believe that
the boy has survived-

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.673
and gone into hiding.

00:02:16.707 --> 00:02:18.811
[snarling]

00:02:18.844 --> 00:02:21.049
Zaboera: Now is the
time for the Mystic Legion

00:02:21.082 --> 00:02:24.856
to distinguish itself in the
eyes of the Dark King, Vearn!

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.899
We must find the Hero and
eliminate him once and for all!

00:02:29.933 --> 00:02:33.608
Now, go forth!
Fly, my legions!

00:02:33.641 --> 00:02:35.544
[vicious cheering]

00:02:36.446 --> 00:02:38.651
Popp: Dai, where are you?

00:02:38.684 --> 00:02:41.690
Chiu: Once I get the scent,
we'll find him in no time.

00:02:41.724 --> 00:02:44.128
[sniffing]

00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:45.030
[alarmed grunt]

00:02:45.063 --> 00:02:46.333
So, anything?!

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:48.403
Uh... My nose is frozen.

00:02:49.271 --> 00:02:52.177
Well I don't know
why I'm surprised.

00:02:53.246 --> 00:02:54.650
Regardless...

00:02:54.683 --> 00:02:57.455
I don't think the usual tracking
methods will be of any use.

00:02:57.488 --> 00:03:00.126
It's possible that
the young seer, Merle,

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.264
could be of use
to us out here.

00:03:02.298 --> 00:03:05.638
Her kind have
a strange power.

00:03:05.671 --> 00:03:08.510
Popp: But the Dark Army
could show up any second.

00:03:08.544 --> 00:03:11.650
Merle's talented, but...
not much of a fighter.

00:03:11.684 --> 00:03:14.221
Crocodine: Well,
I couldn't find a single clue

00:03:14.254 --> 00:03:16.425
when looking down from above.

00:03:17.327 --> 00:03:18.765
So that means...

00:03:18.798 --> 00:03:19.866
I know.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.639
Time for us to get in there
and see what we can see.

00:03:22.672 --> 00:03:24.041
[nervous yell]

00:03:24.075 --> 00:03:25.210
Let's go!

00:03:25.578 --> 00:03:26.580
Whoa, wait!

00:03:26.613 --> 00:03:28.517
Shouldn't we take a
second and warm up first?

00:03:33.694 --> 00:03:35.431
Chiu: I thought
that this was gonna

00:03:35.464 --> 00:03:37.133
finally be my time to shine.

00:03:37.167 --> 00:03:40.406
But this... this
isn't ideal for me.

00:03:41.242 --> 00:03:44.314
I don't know...
how to swim.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.219
Man O'War: [chuckling]

00:03:46.252 --> 00:03:47.755
[alarmed grunt]

00:03:51.763 --> 00:03:52.699
[annoyed yell]

00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:53.768
What's your problem?

00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:56.840
Chiu: I will not be mocked
by some mere Man o'War!

00:03:56.873 --> 00:03:57.675
You little...

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:58.811
[laughing]

00:03:58.844 --> 00:04:00.681
Chiu: [grumbling]

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:04.522
[laughing]

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:05.825
That's it!

00:04:06.794 --> 00:04:09.933
Chiu: Listen.
I've got a proposal.

00:04:09.966 --> 00:04:12.505
I'll make it worth your while.

00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:21.222
So cold!

00:04:21.255 --> 00:04:22.625
T-This is so hopeless.

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:24.830
I could barely
last a few minutes.

00:04:24.863 --> 00:04:28.805
Even Dai couldn't
survive in that water!

00:04:28.838 --> 00:04:31.175
Crocodine: It'd take
forever for the two of us

00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:33.079
to search the
depths of the ocean.

00:04:33.112 --> 00:04:37.288
It's also possible that he's
somewhere above the sea level.

00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:39.959
Buried deep within
the ice and snow.

00:04:39.993 --> 00:04:42.064
And if that is the case...

00:04:42.097 --> 00:04:45.504
how do we find him
among all these?

00:04:48.877 --> 00:04:55.423
Chiu: [humming]

00:04:56.325 --> 00:04:57.896
I thought you
came here to help-

00:04:57.929 --> 00:05:01.102
not sit around fishing
all day, you rat!

00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:01.903
[chuckling]

00:05:01.937 --> 00:05:02.906
To the layman's eye

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:05.176
it may appear like
I'm simply "fishing",

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:08.049
but you would be
severely mistaken.

00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:12.758
My mind is operating on a
whole other level, young mage.

00:05:12.792 --> 00:05:13.760
You wish.

00:05:14.361 --> 00:05:15.898
Ah, it's back!

00:05:17.434 --> 00:05:18.737
What is that?

00:05:18.771 --> 00:05:19.739
[chuckle]

00:05:19.773 --> 00:05:22.210
Haven't you ever seen
a Man o' War in action?

00:05:22.244 --> 00:05:24.148
I've trained this
one to look for Dai

00:05:24.182 --> 00:05:25.852
in return for food, y'see.

00:05:25.885 --> 00:05:29.526
Oh? That is very
impressive, little one.

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:30.995
Chiu: Why, thank you!

00:05:31.028 --> 00:05:34.536
A Fat Rat is like the
king of the monster world.

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:38.042
Any creature
will bow before me.

00:05:38.076 --> 00:05:39.947
Yeah, I doubt that.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.117
Chiu: Hey, did you find Dai?

00:05:43.854 --> 00:05:45.591
Oh! That's his...

00:05:47.093 --> 00:05:50.133
Dai has to be near.
He must be.

00:05:50.166 --> 00:05:51.570
That's all?

00:05:53.674 --> 00:05:56.479
Chiu: Did you really
search everywhere?

00:05:56.513 --> 00:05:58.382
Wasn't there a human?!

00:06:01.022 --> 00:06:02.124
Dai...

00:06:02.157 --> 00:06:05.631
At least now we know that
we are on the right track.

00:06:08.336 --> 00:06:09.572
Huh?

00:06:10.507 --> 00:06:12.645
Chiu: Oh, the food I promised.

00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:16.586
Just hold on a minute.
I haven't caught it yet.

00:06:23.534 --> 00:06:25.571
Alright, that's on me.

00:06:28.443 --> 00:06:32.585
Dai, please... Please,
just... still be alive.

00:06:32.618 --> 00:06:34.890
I promise I'm
going to find you.

00:06:34.923 --> 00:06:37.695
No matter how many
hundreds or thousands

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:40.366
of these icebergs
we have to search...

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.505
I'm not going to give up.

00:06:43.173 --> 00:06:45.076
Dai!

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:49.619
Dai!

00:06:51.222 --> 00:06:52.525
Dai: Popp?

00:06:53.593 --> 00:06:56.866
I thought... I thought
I just heard Popp's voice.

00:06:57.568 --> 00:07:00.641
C-Could the others be nearby?

00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:04.916
Okay...

00:07:08.223 --> 00:07:13.867
This is... the very last bit
of my Aura that I can use...

00:07:13.901 --> 00:07:18.877
Here goes. Please,
Popp... Everyone...

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:20.681
I'm over here!

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:22.818
Popp!

00:07:25.625 --> 00:07:27.895
[surprised breaths]

00:07:30.567 --> 00:07:32.738
Look - that light!
It must be...

00:07:33.239 --> 00:07:35.043
The Dragon Crest!

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.149
It's him!

00:07:38.182 --> 00:07:40.486
Hey! W-Wait up...

00:07:41.757 --> 00:07:43.359
Great, I'm still numb.

00:07:43.393 --> 00:07:44.996
You just wait here.

00:07:45.297 --> 00:07:46.900
Garuda!

00:07:55.317 --> 00:07:56.987
Chiu [thought]:
How pathetic...

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.824
Yet again, Chiu...

00:08:01.997 --> 00:08:03.166
Alright.

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:04.401
So, he survived...

00:08:04.434 --> 00:08:07.575
We knew the little guy was going
to be all right, didn't we?!

00:08:07.608 --> 00:08:08.710
Yes, indeed.

00:08:08.744 --> 00:08:11.082
He must have heard
your voice, somehow.

00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:12.083
[relieved chuckle]

00:08:13.119 --> 00:08:14.822
What's wrong, Crocodine?!

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.565
Guess they heard you, as well.

00:08:21.302 --> 00:08:24.642
Crocodine: It must be a
search party sent by Zaboera.

00:08:24.676 --> 00:08:27.414
I will take care
of them myself.

00:08:27.447 --> 00:08:30.588
Go melt the iceberg
and rescue the hero!

00:08:30.621 --> 00:08:33.092
Are you sure you can
handle them by yourself?

00:08:33.125 --> 00:08:34.094
[amused chuckle]

00:08:34.128 --> 00:08:36.767
It's a little soon for
you to worry about me.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.975
You focus on saving
your friend. Alright?

00:08:41.008 --> 00:08:44.281
'kay - it's a plan.
I'll make it quick!

00:08:58.009 --> 00:09:00.046
You shall not pass!

00:09:12.437 --> 00:09:14.710
There you are, Zaboera.

00:09:14.743 --> 00:09:17.047
A curse upon you, Crocodine.

00:09:17.081 --> 00:09:21.590
Foolish traitors have
no business out here!

00:09:21.623 --> 00:09:23.560
Crocodine: You always
hide in the shadows

00:09:23.593 --> 00:09:26.098
and never get your
hands dirty...

00:09:26.131 --> 00:09:30.139
Yet here you stand,
alongside your servants.

00:09:30.173 --> 00:09:32.778
Zaboera: [cackling]

00:09:32.812 --> 00:09:34.816
Crocodine: I'm guessing
you've lost some stature

00:09:34.849 --> 00:09:36.886
within the Dark Army.

00:09:37.622 --> 00:09:39.593
W-Why you...

00:09:39.626 --> 00:09:41.930
Crocodine: When you
hide behind others,

00:09:41.963 --> 00:09:43.800
leeching off their efforts and

00:09:43.834 --> 00:09:46.540
never working to
better yourself,

00:09:46.573 --> 00:09:49.044
you're bound to end
up like you have...

00:09:49.077 --> 00:09:52.017
Nothing but a
servant yourself!

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:52.851
You shut up.

00:09:52.885 --> 00:09:55.156
Once I take care
of you and the mage,

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:57.194
I'll finish off the hero!

00:09:57.227 --> 00:09:58.697
Get him!

00:10:09.384 --> 00:10:11.255
[chuckling]

00:10:14.427 --> 00:10:15.363
[worried gasp]

00:10:19.171 --> 00:10:22.846
I guess that our time
apart has made you forget...

00:10:22.879 --> 00:10:25.383
The power of the Beast King!

00:10:28.289 --> 00:10:29.959
[frustrated grumble]

00:10:30.459 --> 00:10:32.096
Flying Flayers!

00:10:39.946 --> 00:10:41.816
Looks like they've started.

00:10:42.719 --> 00:10:43.753
Oh, no. The light...

00:10:43.787 --> 00:10:45.724
The light from
the crest is fading!

00:10:48.129 --> 00:10:48.964
P-Popp...

00:10:49.431 --> 00:10:50.399
Popp: Dai!

00:10:59.752 --> 00:11:01.155
I have to hurry.

00:11:01.189 --> 00:11:04.261
Those morons need all
the help they can get!

00:11:34.856 --> 00:11:36.927
Hym: Zaboera is
on the Hero's trail.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.433
He and his minions have
headed out to the frozen sea.

00:11:41.769 --> 00:11:44.609
Hadlar: The fool has
gotten ahead of himself.

00:11:44.642 --> 00:11:46.647
Hym, bring Zaboera back.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.051
By whatever means necessary.

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:50.019
Lord.

00:11:50.053 --> 00:11:52.658
Dai and his
friends belong to me.

00:11:52.691 --> 00:11:54.962
No one else shall fight them.

00:12:08.524 --> 00:12:10.493
[roaring]

00:12:22.886 --> 00:12:24.889
Crocodine: [roaring]

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.198
There. I found him.

00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:30.968
I need to be
careful from here.

00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:33.607
What're you doing
standing around?!

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.676
Leave this to me!

00:12:34.709 --> 00:12:35.611
Huh?!

00:12:35.644 --> 00:12:37.849
Chiu: Rattus Rocket Ram!

00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:43.793
Popp: [pained groans]

00:12:43.827 --> 00:12:45.964
You idiot!

00:12:50.541 --> 00:12:51.309
Dai!

00:12:51.342 --> 00:12:52.478
Wake up!

00:12:52.512 --> 00:12:55.550
Dai? Dai, hang in there!

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.623
H-hey...

00:12:58.657 --> 00:13:01.395
I-I knew I heard
you out there...

00:13:01.428 --> 00:13:02.331
Yeah, obviously.

00:13:02.364 --> 00:13:04.535
Who else is crazy
enough to come out here

00:13:04.569 --> 00:13:06.071
and rescue you, you dummy?

00:13:06.105 --> 00:13:10.312
And me! Don't forget I
came all this way too, Dai!

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.388
Chiu, I need you
to carry that sword.

00:13:14.421 --> 00:13:15.758
Let's get out of here, now.

00:13:15.791 --> 00:13:19.230
What... about... my praise?

00:13:25.978 --> 00:13:29.552
Chiu [thought]: How can a
sword so small be this heavy?

00:13:33.326 --> 00:13:34.427
[gasp]

00:13:35.831 --> 00:13:37.569
Popp: Zaboera...

00:13:37.602 --> 00:13:39.271
He's fast! How did he-

00:13:39.304 --> 00:13:43.513
Flying Flayers! Cast
your Kafrizz spells on me!

00:13:53.032 --> 00:13:54.769
Oh, no. Not good.

00:13:54.802 --> 00:13:57.641
Zaboera: This is my
ultimate counter magic,

00:13:57.675 --> 00:14:00.914
the convergence
spell, Hexcitation.

00:14:00.947 --> 00:14:04.020
It will absorb the magic
power of another's spell,

00:14:04.054 --> 00:14:07.628
combine it with my
own spell, and fire!

00:14:07.662 --> 00:14:11.135
With the united Kafrizz
of me and my Flying Flayers,

00:14:11.168 --> 00:14:14.709
I'll evaporate you
and this entire iceberg!

00:14:14.742 --> 00:14:16.979
Dai, Popp! Run!

00:14:17.013 --> 00:14:18.684
Popp [thought]:
If I run using Zoom,

00:14:18.717 --> 00:14:20.788
the spell will just hit Chiu.

00:14:20.821 --> 00:14:23.661
Can I cancel it out
with a spell of my own?!

00:14:23.694 --> 00:14:25.530
Perish!

00:14:33.345 --> 00:14:34.414
[shocked yell]

00:14:34.447 --> 00:14:36.418
What happened?!

00:15:08.684 --> 00:15:11.589
Wh-Wh-What is that!?

00:15:15.598 --> 00:15:17.801
Who's this? An ally?

00:15:17.835 --> 00:15:19.071
A man made of metal?

00:15:19.104 --> 00:15:21.408
Some new kind of foe?

00:15:21.441 --> 00:15:24.649
But then, why did
it save them?!

00:15:24.682 --> 00:15:26.485
What is this?

00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:28.155
Who are you?!

00:15:30.861 --> 00:15:34.067
How dare you stand in my way!

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.674
Even Zaboera doesn't
even know who this is?

00:15:37.708 --> 00:15:43.419
I am one of Lord Hadlar's
loyal soldiers, the pawn, Hym!

00:15:43.453 --> 00:15:44.254
Hym?

00:15:46.392 --> 00:15:48.463
Popp [thought]:
Did he say pawn?

00:15:48.496 --> 00:15:51.435
Hym: My master has
ordered me to retrieve you,

00:15:51.468 --> 00:15:55.577
to end your disobedience,
that's gone on long enough.

00:16:27.775 --> 00:16:29.813
Crocodine [thought]:
He's powerful.

00:16:29.846 --> 00:16:33.085
Fine, metal man - take this!

00:16:36.091 --> 00:16:38.295
[chuckling]

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:44.575
[shocked gasp]

00:16:48.148 --> 00:16:52.156
Impossible! My spell
had no effect at all...

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:53.458
Come to think of it,

00:16:53.492 --> 00:16:58.102
you already repelled my
Hexcitation spell with ease.

00:16:58.135 --> 00:17:00.039
What are you?

00:17:00.674 --> 00:17:02.277
You old fool.

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:04.548
I am one of the ultimate guards

00:17:04.582 --> 00:17:08.322
created by your direct
superior, master Hadlar.

00:17:08.356 --> 00:17:11.996
My entire body is
made of Orichalcum.

00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:15.671
I am invulnerable to
all attacks and spells.

00:17:15.704 --> 00:17:17.407
Only an Orichalcum blade or

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.146
the omnipotent
Dark King Vearn himself

00:17:20.179 --> 00:17:23.587
can do any harm to
something as powerful as I.

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:24.622
W-What?!

00:17:28.997 --> 00:17:30.499
Ah, you there!

00:17:31.068 --> 00:17:32.169
Huh?!

00:17:32.203 --> 00:17:34.440
Hym: That sword
belongs to you?

00:17:35.677 --> 00:17:39.084
Shame. The owner of that
blade might have actually

00:17:39.118 --> 00:17:41.188
put up a good fight.

00:17:41.222 --> 00:17:44.060
Then why not end this
battle here and now?!

00:17:44.094 --> 00:17:46.699
Why bother protecting us?!

00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:48.603
[laughing]

00:17:48.637 --> 00:17:51.709
I'm not some disobedient
scumbag like this one.

00:17:51.743 --> 00:17:55.116
You see, I am a proud
servant of Lord Hadlar.

00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:58.790
I will only face my
opponents head-on in battle.

00:17:58.824 --> 00:18:04.635
Ending you in such a cheap way
would be miserably boring.

00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:07.641
I protect the Field of
Death with my four comrades

00:18:07.674 --> 00:18:11.348
under the orders of our
Dark Lord without hesitation.

00:18:11.381 --> 00:18:15.323
We shall cross
paths, eventually.

00:18:15.356 --> 00:18:18.062
You'd better train for
when that day comes.

00:18:18.095 --> 00:18:20.867
I'd hate to see
Hadlar be disappointed.

00:18:20.901 --> 00:18:23.706
[laughing]

00:18:28.148 --> 00:18:29.418
Are you okay?

00:18:29.451 --> 00:18:31.121
Uh, y-yeah.

00:18:32.925 --> 00:18:36.164
Our enemy just rescued us.

00:18:36.197 --> 00:18:41.142
Hey, Crocodine. That guy
said that he was a "pawn".

00:18:41.175 --> 00:18:42.978
By pawn, did he mean...

00:18:43.012 --> 00:18:47.453
Crocodine: Yes. It's the name
of the weakest piece in chess.

00:18:48.723 --> 00:18:51.361
You're saying that
thing was the weakest?

00:18:51.394 --> 00:18:54.635
It's a scary thought,
but... seems so.

00:18:57.174 --> 00:18:58.543
Dai: Let's go, guys.

00:18:59.545 --> 00:19:02.116
We should really
get back to Papnica.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:03.687
There's lots to do, right?

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.590
It's true - I suppose.

00:19:05.624 --> 00:19:08.329
I completely forgot that
you're still half-frozen

00:19:08.362 --> 00:19:10.199
and pretty banged up.

00:19:10.867 --> 00:19:12.738
Yeah, sure am.

00:19:12.771 --> 00:19:14.675
[chuckling]

00:19:14.709 --> 00:19:15.777
[giggling]

00:19:17.013 --> 00:19:19.117
Popp: All right.
Back to Papnica!

00:19:19.151 --> 00:19:21.221
We can figure
things out then.

00:19:29.505 --> 00:19:31.609
Will you fix your
landings, already?!

00:19:31.642 --> 00:19:35.216
Don't blame me!
I carried all of you!

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.453
Maam: Dai! Everyone!

00:19:39.057 --> 00:19:40.492
Thank goodness you're back!

00:19:40.527 --> 00:19:42.497
Didn't I say you
could depend on me?

00:19:42.531 --> 00:19:45.202
He needed some help,
but we pulled it off.

00:19:45.236 --> 00:19:45.970
Maam: Dai!

00:19:46.004 --> 00:19:47.273
Both: Huh?

00:19:48.175 --> 00:19:50.914
Oh, Dai, you're...
You're back!

00:19:52.584 --> 00:19:53.820
It's a miracle!

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.309
How dare-

00:20:06.377 --> 00:20:09.818
Hym: You don't have the
power to escape that cage.

00:20:09.852 --> 00:20:12.891
Why don't you just cool
your head in there for now?

00:20:14.293 --> 00:20:17.399
W-Wait! Wait!

00:20:19.638 --> 00:20:24.213
Curse you, Hadlar.
How dare you steal my glory!

00:20:24.247 --> 00:20:26.418
Killvearn: It's
time to see Hadlar's

00:20:26.451 --> 00:20:29.525
newly assembled royal guard.

00:20:29.558 --> 00:20:32.832
Giving him five whole
Orichalcum warriors

00:20:32.865 --> 00:20:36.572
was rather generous
of you, King Vearn.

00:20:36.605 --> 00:20:38.442
Why shouldn't I?

00:20:38.475 --> 00:20:40.547
Mere Gargoyles and Archdemons

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:45.590
wouldn't be strong enough to
be Hadlar's guard these days.

00:20:48.495 --> 00:20:49.865
At last.

00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:54.441
Hadlar: Oh, great
Dark King Vearn,

00:20:54.474 --> 00:20:58.883
I present to you my
fearsome new servants.

00:20:58.917 --> 00:21:04.661
Five pieces born from your
everlasting Orichalcum gifts.

00:21:06.833 --> 00:21:09.403
First is the pawn, Hym.

00:21:10.707 --> 00:21:12.944
The knight, Sigma.

00:21:15.249 --> 00:21:17.687
The bishop, Fenbren.

00:21:20.125 --> 00:21:21.929
Block, the rook.

00:21:24.468 --> 00:21:26.705
And queen Albinass.

00:21:29.143 --> 00:21:31.414
The ultimate force
which will protect

00:21:31.448 --> 00:21:34.789
the Field of Death
from all invaders...

00:21:34.822 --> 00:21:37.426
the Hadlar Royal Guard!

00:21:38.095 --> 00:21:40.567
Magnificent, Hadlar.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.709
You shall be the leader
of that royal guard.

00:21:44.742 --> 00:21:48.015
Once the Disciples of
Avan are defeated,

00:21:48.048 --> 00:21:50.386
and the world is
conquered at last,

00:21:50.419 --> 00:21:55.029
I shall grant you dominion
over the surface world.

00:21:55.062 --> 00:21:56.565
And when that day comes,

00:21:56.599 --> 00:22:02.611
you will truly reclaim
the title of Dark Lord.

00:23:37.166 --> 00:23:39.805
Narrator: With the showdown
against King Vearn drawing near,

00:23:39.838 --> 00:23:43.779
the Disciples of Avan all
work to hone their skills.

00:23:43.813 --> 00:23:47.420
In search of an incantation to
beat Hadlar's Royal Guard,

00:23:47.453 --> 00:23:49.958
Popp visits Matoriv,
who unveils a spell

00:23:49.992 --> 00:23:53.766
that even the Grand Sorcerer
himself fears to use...

00:23:53.799 --> 00:23:56.205
But will Popp survive
the deadly training?

00:23:56.238 --> 00:23:57.473
Find out next time on

00:23:57.507 --> 00:23:59.879
