WEBVTT

00:01:51.456 --> 00:01:54.629
Hadlar [thought]:
How am I still alive?

00:01:54.662 --> 00:01:55.631
I remember...

00:01:55.665 --> 00:02:01.009
Hyunckel pierced both of
my hearts, killing me.

00:02:01.042 --> 00:02:03.045
And this mark...

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.152
Mystvearn: That
is due to Dark Aura.

00:02:06.186 --> 00:02:09.158
I see. You used
your Dark Aura power

00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:13.634
to resurrect me so I
could complete my duties.

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:17.141
Then, is my body even more
powerful than it was before?

00:02:17.174 --> 00:02:19.078
Mystvearn: That is
the secret of the body

00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:21.550
King Vearn has
bestowed you with.

00:02:21.583 --> 00:02:25.591
So long as the Dark Aura of
His Majesty or myself remains,

00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:28.631
should you perish,
you will be revived.

00:02:28.665 --> 00:02:32.839
And with far greater
power than before.

00:02:32.872 --> 00:02:36.279
Is that the reason why
you were placed beside me?

00:02:36.313 --> 00:02:38.885
Mystvearn: Hadlar,
your body belongs to

00:02:38.918 --> 00:02:40.589
the almighty King Vearn.

00:02:40.622 --> 00:02:44.563
You can no longer
choose your own fate.

00:02:44.596 --> 00:02:47.468
No matter how many
times you fall,

00:02:47.502 --> 00:02:52.344
you'll only return to fight on
for the will of your master.

00:02:53.514 --> 00:02:58.089
Yes. Gladly.
Where are you going?

00:02:58.122 --> 00:02:59.926
Mystvearn: Back to
the battlefield.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.400
Hadlar [thought]: For a man who
waits silently in the shadows,

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:06.305
he's become quite talkative.

00:03:08.076 --> 00:03:10.948
Now, it's done.
I have hit... my target.

00:03:14.188 --> 00:03:17.427
Flazzard: [frustrated cries]

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.402
Hyunckel [thought]:
The power of that core kept

00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:25.143
the two sides of Flazzard's
body fused together.

00:03:25.177 --> 00:03:27.783
Now, with it gone...

00:03:27.816 --> 00:03:30.554
Flazzard: My... My body
is falling apart!

00:03:30.588 --> 00:03:34.428
If I remain together,
I'll vaporize myself!

00:03:43.113 --> 00:03:44.182
Popp, now!

00:03:44.215 --> 00:03:45.416
Popp: Right!

00:03:45.885 --> 00:03:47.054
Sizzle!

00:03:47.087 --> 00:03:50.293
[screeching]

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:54.468
Ha! Take that.

00:03:54.503 --> 00:03:56.673
Very well done, Dai!

00:03:56.706 --> 00:03:57.842
[weakened groan]

00:03:58.911 --> 00:04:00.781
So, what do we do about him?

00:04:00.815 --> 00:04:04.823
I'm going to make it so that he
can never rebuild himself again.

00:04:05.391 --> 00:04:06.993
Wait! Please don't!

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.437
[roaring]

00:04:17.414 --> 00:04:18.917
Crocodine: The
Shadow Vizier...

00:04:18.951 --> 00:04:20.588
Mystvearn!

00:04:21.422 --> 00:04:23.459
Mystvearn, you've
gotta help me.

00:04:23.493 --> 00:04:26.834
Please! I can't
just die like this.

00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:28.937
Do something!

00:04:38.156 --> 00:04:39.993
What is... What is that?

00:04:40.026 --> 00:04:43.400
Mystvearn: The ultimate
armor of my Shadow Legion.

00:04:43.433 --> 00:04:46.506
If you choose to be
one with my Dark Aura,

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.818
to become a force of Dark Fire
Energy, it will be yours.

00:04:53.286 --> 00:04:54.422
W-what?

00:04:54.455 --> 00:04:57.161
But that would mean
becoming your servant.

00:04:57.194 --> 00:04:59.666
There's no way I'm doing that!

00:05:02.104 --> 00:05:03.640
So, If I...

00:05:03.674 --> 00:05:08.249
If I merge with your energy,
can I really beat them?

00:05:08.283 --> 00:05:10.721
Mystvearn: You will
be unrivaled.

00:05:13.994 --> 00:05:17.000
Fine, then. Do it!

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:54.075
Flazzard: The power!

00:05:54.108 --> 00:05:56.178
The power is overwhelming...

00:05:56.212 --> 00:05:59.451
Such unbelievable,
extraordinary power!

00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:02.258
This is amazing!

00:06:02.291 --> 00:06:03.527
Stand back!

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.733
I am the greatest swordsman
in all of Papnica...

00:06:08.135 --> 00:06:09.539
What's that?!

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.244
No, Gomechan! Baduck!

00:06:12.277 --> 00:06:13.446
Oh, that's just great...

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.519
They chose the worst
time to show up!

00:06:19.526 --> 00:06:29.244
[struggling grunts]

00:06:29.278 --> 00:06:31.215
W...What?!

00:06:31.248 --> 00:06:32.551
[falling yell]

00:06:34.021 --> 00:06:35.925
[falling yell]

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:39.097
[victorious cackle]

00:06:39.131 --> 00:06:40.066
Crocodine!

00:06:43.874 --> 00:06:45.109
Crackle!

00:06:46.145 --> 00:06:47.882
My spell's not working!

00:06:54.829 --> 00:06:56.867
Flazzard: This armor is amazing!

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.106
It's stronger and faster
than I used to be...

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.714
And it's immune to spells!

00:07:04.983 --> 00:07:08.189
Flazzard [thought]:
I'll be taking you out later.

00:07:08.222 --> 00:07:14.468
But first... I need to crush
this annoying little brat.

00:07:14.502 --> 00:07:16.507
Dai: He's coming.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.812
I'm the one he's after.
Get back, Maam.

00:07:20.346 --> 00:07:21.583
But, you can't!

00:07:21.616 --> 00:07:23.687
You just don't
have the strength!

00:07:26.459 --> 00:07:28.730
Flazzard: You've
got some guts, kid!

00:07:28.764 --> 00:07:33.640
Let's see if I can send you to
the afterlife with one punch!

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:36.713
No, Dai!

00:07:41.355 --> 00:07:42.324
Flazzard: What?!

00:07:42.358 --> 00:07:43.460
He's okay!

00:07:43.493 --> 00:07:47.200
It's okay, Maam,
I'm fine. I can win this.

00:07:48.002 --> 00:07:48.971
Dai: I don't know why,

00:07:49.004 --> 00:07:51.910
but I don't feel like
I can lose to him.

00:07:51.943 --> 00:07:54.048
Flazzard: You
can't lose to me?

00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:57.187
Your annoying words
are all you have left.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.060
But they won't
last much longer.

00:08:00.093 --> 00:08:02.130
Let's end this!

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.775
Why, you...

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.121
He's reading the movements of
all those powerful attacks!

00:08:14.154 --> 00:08:16.560
And with his eyes closed, too!

00:08:16.593 --> 00:08:17.862
Hyunckel: It's complete.

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:21.268
By obtaining Air Slash,

00:08:21.301 --> 00:08:24.909
Dai's completed his
Avan Style Sword Technique.

00:08:24.943 --> 00:08:29.318
That means his super attack
will also be complete.

00:08:29.352 --> 00:08:31.790
By super attack, you mean?

00:08:31.823 --> 00:08:32.926
I mean,

00:08:32.959 --> 00:08:35.798
he subconsciously understands
its destructive power.

00:08:35.831 --> 00:08:38.703
That's why he
knows he can win.

00:08:42.912 --> 00:08:45.852
Flazzard: You're kidding.
This is impossible.

00:08:45.885 --> 00:08:49.191
I'm supposed
to be invincible.

00:08:49.224 --> 00:08:51.696
I've got the ultimate armor!

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:53.968
I can't lose to this rat!

00:08:54.001 --> 00:08:56.807
With this power
and this durability...

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:01.850
If I lose now...
I'll look like a fool!

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.156
Dai [thought]:
Slice the earth...

00:09:05.691 --> 00:09:07.060
Slice the sea...

00:09:07.928 --> 00:09:09.197
Slice the air...

00:09:10.266 --> 00:09:12.605
And then everything at once.

00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:14.542
I was able to do
the Air Slash...

00:09:14.575 --> 00:09:15.711
So, I know...

00:09:15.745 --> 00:09:19.084
I know I have
the power to do it!

00:09:21.723 --> 00:09:22.925
Here it comes!

00:09:25.631 --> 00:09:28.369
Watch me, Master Avan!

00:09:28.402 --> 00:09:31.142
Now... This is...
This is a true...

00:09:31.175 --> 00:09:33.847
Avan Strash!

00:09:35.885 --> 00:09:37.187
Aw, yeah!

00:09:39.826 --> 00:09:41.863
Mystvearn: Magnificent.

00:09:44.034 --> 00:09:45.202
Popp: Wow!

00:09:45.236 --> 00:09:48.978
So that's the power of the
complete Avan Strash ability?

00:09:49.011 --> 00:09:53.653
Hyunckel: It rivals Avan's,
no, it might be even stronger.

00:09:53.687 --> 00:09:55.089
Well done.

00:09:57.327 --> 00:09:58.395
Dai!

00:10:00.835 --> 00:10:04.241
Flazzard: [whimpering]

00:10:07.581 --> 00:10:10.554
Flazzard: You... You
lied to me, you bastard!

00:10:10.587 --> 00:10:13.594
How was that
the ultimate armor?

00:10:13.628 --> 00:10:14.929
Mystvearn: No lies.

00:10:14.962 --> 00:10:19.338
That was indeed the
ultimate armor of my legion.

00:10:19.372 --> 00:10:20.774
If it was destroyed,

00:10:20.808 --> 00:10:25.885
it merely means your foe's
attack was that much stronger.

00:10:25.918 --> 00:10:29.157
Flazzard: Please!
Give me another chance!

00:10:29.191 --> 00:10:30.159
Mystvear-

00:10:35.771 --> 00:10:37.542
Who would do such a thing...

00:10:37.575 --> 00:10:39.278
To their own ally?

00:10:39.311 --> 00:10:41.517
Hyunckel [thought]:
Did Mystvearn use Flazzard

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.854
just to test Dai's strength?

00:10:43.887 --> 00:10:46.325
Even within the Dark Army...

00:10:46.358 --> 00:10:50.233
that's a level of cruelty
I have not seen before.

00:10:51.202 --> 00:10:51.970
Let's hurry.

00:10:52.003 --> 00:10:53.607
The Princess is in the tower!

00:10:53.641 --> 00:10:54.976
Baduck: Oh, that's right!

00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:56.479
Now that the
menace is no more,

00:10:56.513 --> 00:11:00.253
the ice of his forbidden
magic should be gone, as well!

00:11:00.286 --> 00:11:02.190
Popp: He was a real villain,

00:11:02.223 --> 00:11:05.129
but that was a
pretty nasty way to go.

00:11:05.163 --> 00:11:09.204
Should we gather up the
fragments and make a grave?

00:11:09.237 --> 00:11:15.717
Hyunckel: No need. That's
his gravestone right there.

00:11:32.652 --> 00:11:33.720
But - how?!

00:11:34.556 --> 00:11:36.259
Baduck: What's
the meaning of this?

00:11:36.292 --> 00:11:38.463
It hasn't melted at all!

00:11:38.496 --> 00:11:40.701
No, it is melting.

00:11:40.734 --> 00:11:42.004
Maam: What is it, then?

00:11:42.037 --> 00:11:45.277
It seems like we're...
Just too late.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.147
T-Too late?

00:11:47.181 --> 00:11:50.521
Hyunckel: Flazzard is gone and
his Forbidden Magic has lifted.

00:11:50.555 --> 00:11:51.757
But it would appear

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:54.662
the Princess doesn't
have the strength left...

00:11:54.695 --> 00:11:57.500
to break herself
free of its power.

00:11:57.534 --> 00:12:02.410
What? No...
Princess! Princess!

00:12:04.415 --> 00:12:08.422
Flazzard: Your Princess's
life ends tomorrow at sundown!

00:12:09.659 --> 00:12:10.861
Popp: Sizz!

00:12:14.936 --> 00:12:17.241
Crocodine: It's not
doing anything.

00:12:17.274 --> 00:12:19.980
In that case... Sizzle!

00:12:20.013 --> 00:12:23.920
Baduck: Popp, hang
in there. You can do it!

00:12:25.424 --> 00:12:26.559
Popp: It's no good.

00:12:26.593 --> 00:12:29.665
None of the spells
I know will melt it.

00:12:29.699 --> 00:12:31.736
Crocodine: Then
I'll have to risk it

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:33.506
and shatter it with this.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:37.347
Baduck: A-And what if you
shatter the Princess, as well?

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:41.355
Well, do we have
any other options?

00:12:41.388 --> 00:12:42.591
Maam: I know!

00:12:42.625 --> 00:12:44.494
This round contains
a Sizz spell.

00:12:44.528 --> 00:12:46.767
If we charge it
with a Sizzle too,

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.605
maybe it can fire
an even greater flame.

00:12:49.639 --> 00:12:53.345
But, I've never charged a
round with more than one spell.

00:12:53.379 --> 00:12:54.983
But if you do that,

00:12:55.016 --> 00:12:57.922
it might break your
Magic Bullet Gun, right?

00:12:57.955 --> 00:12:59.592
And if we don't...

00:12:59.626 --> 00:13:02.330
This is the
Princess's life here!

00:13:02.363 --> 00:13:06.138
Popp: The Magic Bullet Gun
isn't just some item.

00:13:06.171 --> 00:13:10.514
Master Avan made it.
It's all that's left of him.

00:13:13.452 --> 00:13:15.289
I say we try it.

00:13:15.322 --> 00:13:16.826
Maam: Master said
this weapon was

00:13:16.859 --> 00:13:19.498
specially made for
helping people.

00:13:19.533 --> 00:13:21.234
We can't hold back.

00:13:21.268 --> 00:13:24.241
I'm sure he made it for
times just like this.

00:13:24.274 --> 00:13:26.244
Okay. Fine.

00:13:27.681 --> 00:13:28.950
Give it here.

00:13:30.721 --> 00:13:32.123
Popp: Huh?

00:13:34.327 --> 00:13:36.800
What is it, Popp?
What's wrong?

00:13:36.833 --> 00:13:38.102
Popp: [whimpering]

00:13:38.135 --> 00:13:39.772
Maam: He's out of Magic Power!

00:13:39.805 --> 00:13:42.845
Hey, Popp! You can't give up.

00:13:42.878 --> 00:13:45.984
You're the only one
who can cast Sizzle!

00:13:54.234 --> 00:13:56.907
Dai [thought]: If I really
do have a mysterious power

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.344
like everyone says...

00:13:59.378 --> 00:14:05.490
Then let me use that power,
not to fight someone,

00:14:05.524 --> 00:14:08.731
but to save someone's life.

00:14:08.764 --> 00:14:11.536
To save Leona's life!

00:14:14.207 --> 00:14:16.813
Look there. What's that mark?

00:14:16.847 --> 00:14:21.757
Crocodine: That is the mystic
power that dwells within Dai.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:24.294
But... it's not coming
from any anger...

00:14:24.327 --> 00:14:27.467
It's responding to something
other than combat!

00:14:29.572 --> 00:14:30.941
Sizzle!

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.549
It's charged!

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:35.383
Maam!

00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:36.418
Yeah!

00:14:42.531 --> 00:14:43.566
Maam: Please...

00:14:58.396 --> 00:14:59.532
Leona!

00:15:04.575 --> 00:15:06.947
Leona... She's alive.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.650
She's alive!

00:15:08.683 --> 00:15:09.819
[relieved cry]

00:15:09.852 --> 00:15:10.988
Thank goodness!

00:15:11.021 --> 00:15:12.224
[happy chirping]

00:15:12.257 --> 00:15:13.192
You did it!

00:15:15.396 --> 00:15:17.835
Maam [thought]:
I'm sorry to see you go...

00:15:17.868 --> 00:15:19.873
But it's okay, right?

00:15:19.906 --> 00:15:23.178
Thanks to you,
a person's life was saved.

00:15:23.212 --> 00:15:27.086
So, thank you...
for everything.

00:15:28.388 --> 00:15:31.028
Matoriv: Hey, kid!
Are you alive?

00:15:31.061 --> 00:15:32.463
That voice...

00:15:33.466 --> 00:15:35.003
Mentor!

00:15:35.036 --> 00:15:37.106
Man: Okay. The food's ready.

00:15:37.675 --> 00:15:38.810
Man: Where does this go?

00:15:38.844 --> 00:15:42.217
Baduck: A feast!
A victory feast!

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:45.289
Food goes there.
Drinks over here.

00:15:45.323 --> 00:15:47.528
The Papnica soldiers
who were scattered

00:15:47.562 --> 00:15:49.464
have begun to return home.

00:15:49.497 --> 00:15:53.372
They heard you rescued the
Princess. Word travels fast.

00:15:54.208 --> 00:15:55.644
Well, you really saved us

00:15:55.677 --> 00:15:59.050
by fixing the Balloon Ship
and coming to get us.

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:09.605
Leona!

00:16:11.241 --> 00:16:12.210
Leona!

00:16:12.243 --> 00:16:14.314
I'm so glad that
you're all better.

00:16:14.347 --> 00:16:16.920
Your face was as
pale as a King Squid-

00:16:16.953 --> 00:16:19.324
I was so worried about you!

00:16:21.495 --> 00:16:23.633
W-What is it, Leona?

00:16:23.667 --> 00:16:26.037
Have you... forgotten me?

00:16:26.872 --> 00:16:28.610
Honestly! Give me
a break, Dai.

00:16:28.643 --> 00:16:31.014
It's supposed to be
the emotional reunion

00:16:31.048 --> 00:16:33.419
between the Princess
and her rescuer.

00:16:33.452 --> 00:16:34.487
A "King Squid"?!

00:16:35.356 --> 00:16:36.693
Huh?!

00:16:36.727 --> 00:16:38.831
[delighted laughter]

00:16:38.864 --> 00:16:40.399
Cheers!

00:16:43.239 --> 00:16:45.443
Leona: You have all
fought bravely.

00:16:45.477 --> 00:16:49.083
Especially Dai and the
other Disciples of Avan.

00:16:49.117 --> 00:16:52.189
No words can express
our gratitude.

00:16:53.927 --> 00:16:56.633
My father was right
to send Master Avan

00:16:56.666 --> 00:16:58.603
as the Hero's Tutor, wasn't he?

00:16:58.637 --> 00:17:00.240
He really taught you well.

00:17:00.273 --> 00:17:03.412
I'm afraid we lost
the King of Papnica...

00:17:03.445 --> 00:17:06.318
During the
Dark Army's attack.

00:17:06.352 --> 00:17:09.491
Since then, the Princess
has united the people,

00:17:09.525 --> 00:17:13.399
and carries on his legacy
by continuing the fight.

00:17:13.432 --> 00:17:17.708
Tell me, Dai, is that swordsman
also a Disciple of Avan?

00:17:17.741 --> 00:17:18.544
Both: Huh?!

00:17:18.577 --> 00:17:19.277
Yikes...

00:17:19.311 --> 00:17:21.215
Dai: Uh, well,
of course he is!

00:17:21.248 --> 00:17:23.418
Then I should thank him, too.

00:17:24.187 --> 00:17:25.524
Your Highness,

00:17:25.557 --> 00:17:28.630
there's something that you
need to understand about me.

00:17:28.663 --> 00:17:30.400
Uh, well, Leona? He's-

00:17:30.433 --> 00:17:33.873
Hyunckel: I am Commander of
the Dark Army's Undead Legion,

00:17:33.907 --> 00:17:34.909
Hyunckel.

00:17:34.943 --> 00:17:36.211
Man: The Dark Army?

00:17:36.244 --> 00:17:38.282
Man: Undead Legion
Commander?!

00:17:43.593 --> 00:17:44.628
Popp: That idiot!

00:17:44.662 --> 00:17:46.131
Leona: Is that true?

00:17:46.164 --> 00:17:47.233
Wait a minute.

00:17:47.267 --> 00:17:49.806
He's not with the
Dark Army, anymore!

00:17:49.839 --> 00:17:53.178
Maam: That's right. He really
is a Disciple of Avan's.

00:17:53.211 --> 00:17:55.182
And he's really
trying to help us!

00:17:55.215 --> 00:17:59.157
No matter how I may have
atoned, the fact remains:

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:01.095
as the Undead
Legion Commander,

00:18:01.128 --> 00:18:04.034
I am responsible
for this destruction.

00:18:04.067 --> 00:18:06.773
For that, I must be punished.

00:18:06.806 --> 00:18:08.075
Princess, I...

00:18:08.108 --> 00:18:11.081
request that you pass
judgement upon me.

00:18:11.115 --> 00:18:14.054
Strike me down now
if it be your will.

00:18:14.087 --> 00:18:15.223
Dai: Hyunckel...

00:18:15.256 --> 00:18:17.995
I consider it a blessing
to have been saved,

00:18:18.028 --> 00:18:20.700
and to lend my
strength to you, Dai.

00:18:21.268 --> 00:18:23.640
I can rest fulfilled.

00:18:24.542 --> 00:18:25.577
Leona: Hyunckel...

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:26.846
As you wish.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.785
I, Leona, the
Princess of Papnica,

00:18:29.818 --> 00:18:31.890
shall pass judgement upon you.

00:18:31.923 --> 00:18:33.158
From this day on,

00:18:33.192 --> 00:18:35.363
you will spend all of
your remaining days...

00:18:35.396 --> 00:18:38.268
serving as one of
the Disciples of Avan.

00:18:40.306 --> 00:18:41.977
Leona: You will risk your life

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:45.984
fighting for friendship,
justice, and love.

00:18:46.017 --> 00:18:48.857
And you must never
disparage yourself

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:50.293
or ever allow...

00:18:50.326 --> 00:18:53.099
the past to keep you
from moving forward.

00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:54.434
Leona...

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:57.741
That's all. Do I
make myself clear?

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:00.781
I shall accept this.

00:19:00.814 --> 00:19:01.950
Well, then that settles it.

00:19:01.983 --> 00:19:03.920
We shall all move
forward together!

00:19:03.954 --> 00:19:05.256
[applause]

00:19:05.289 --> 00:19:07.426
Matoriv [thought]: She's more
capable than she looks.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.800
Papnica just might
rise from the ashes.

00:19:17.313 --> 00:19:19.317
Ah, so there you are.

00:19:19.786 --> 00:19:20.521
You again.

00:19:20.554 --> 00:19:22.525
We've been looking for you.

00:19:22.558 --> 00:19:25.730
What are you doing
drinking alone out here?

00:19:27.433 --> 00:19:28.770
It doesn't seem right to have

00:19:28.804 --> 00:19:31.976
a monster like me
drinking among the humans.

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:33.613
Don't be ridiculous.

00:19:33.647 --> 00:19:38.021
A hero is a hero,
no matter what their kind.

00:19:38.055 --> 00:19:40.492
Drink up, now! Big fella.

00:19:40.527 --> 00:19:42.664
To the Princess's savior!

00:19:45.904 --> 00:19:48.208
[amazed gasps]

00:19:52.083 --> 00:19:53.419
Delicious.

00:19:53.452 --> 00:19:57.460
This is the most delicious
drink I've ever had!

00:19:58.195 --> 00:19:59.765
Mentor, I can't breath here!

00:19:59.799 --> 00:20:01.302
I'm sorry, Princess.

00:20:01.335 --> 00:20:03.039
I didn't know that...

00:20:03.072 --> 00:20:05.476
Uncle Matoriv would
cut loose like this.

00:20:05.511 --> 00:20:07.380
You don't have
to be so formal.

00:20:07.413 --> 00:20:10.554
You can just call me Leona,
not "Princess."

00:20:10.587 --> 00:20:12.324
Otherwise, I'll have
to start calling you

00:20:12.357 --> 00:20:14.127
something like "Miss Maam."

00:20:14.161 --> 00:20:15.764
Oh, please don't do that!

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:20.172
Maam: Hyunckel!

00:20:20.206 --> 00:20:22.476
Where are you going?
What's wrong?

00:20:22.511 --> 00:20:24.281
Hyunckel: We didn't
want to interrupt.

00:20:24.314 --> 00:20:26.218
We're heading to
Sovereign Rock Castle.

00:20:26.251 --> 00:20:27.420
Sovereign Rock?

00:20:27.454 --> 00:20:29.792
The Dark Army's fortress.

00:20:29.826 --> 00:20:32.330
It lies north of Papnica,

00:20:32.363 --> 00:20:35.670
and deep within the
mountain range of Guildmain.

00:20:35.703 --> 00:20:39.110
Crocodine and I are going to
check on their movements.

00:20:39.144 --> 00:20:41.315
Then why don't we all go?

00:20:41.348 --> 00:20:44.053
It'll be easier
with just the two of us.

00:20:44.087 --> 00:20:46.024
So please, trust me.

00:20:46.057 --> 00:20:48.797
I had a wonderful
time this evening.

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:53.071
Give my regards to Dai
and the people of Papnica.

00:20:53.104 --> 00:20:55.510
Hyunckel: We'll
meet again, Maam.

00:20:56.111 --> 00:20:57.647
Take care.

00:21:12.544 --> 00:21:14.915
Zaboera: This man
is a monster!

00:21:14.949 --> 00:21:19.323
Even Carl Kingdom, with its
dozens of powerful knights,

00:21:19.357 --> 00:21:23.198
is on the brink of ruin
after only five days!

00:21:23.231 --> 00:21:24.334
Baran: I see.

00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:27.173
That boy Dai seems
quite impressive.

00:21:27.206 --> 00:21:31.180
He and his allies managed to
fight off the entire Dark Army.

00:21:31.214 --> 00:21:35.891
He's an incredibly strange child
with mysterious abilities.

00:21:35.924 --> 00:21:38.697
Whenever this mark
shines on his forehead,

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:42.136
he exhibits the
most amazing power...

00:21:42.169 --> 00:21:43.471
Baran: A mark?!

00:21:46.345 --> 00:21:49.283
Zaboera; this shining
mark doesn't happen to

00:21:49.317 --> 00:21:52.189
resemble the face of
a dragon, does it?

00:21:52.223 --> 00:21:53.626
A dragon?

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:57.233
Now that you mention it,
it does seem similar.

00:21:57.267 --> 00:21:58.936
Baran: Curse you, Hadlar.

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.074
I know what you're up to.

00:23:37.299 --> 00:23:40.172
Narrator: With Flazzard defeated
and Princess Leona rescued,

00:23:40.206 --> 00:23:43.278
Dai and his friends prepare
for their next battle.

00:23:43.311 --> 00:23:45.416
But Maam's broken
Magic Bullet Gun

00:23:45.449 --> 00:23:47.554
leads her to
a difficult choice.

00:23:47.587 --> 00:23:49.691
Meanwhile,
Killvearn the Reaper

00:23:49.724 --> 00:23:52.697
appears before Hadlar and
his remaining Commanders...

00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:54.568
