WEBVTT

00:01:50.387 --> 00:01:52.859
Wh-What is that thing?

00:01:54.162 --> 00:01:56.867
Dai: Is... Is it alive?!

00:01:59.873 --> 00:02:01.409
All right, then...

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:10.327
Goroa: No, stop!

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.665
Goroa: I said stop it. Hey!

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:15.303
Enough. What's
the matter with you?

00:02:16.105 --> 00:02:18.410
Goroa: Cut it out! Right now!

00:02:18.443 --> 00:02:19.646
Please!

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.614
Hey, you!

00:02:23.152 --> 00:02:24.857
Wh-Who... Who
the heck are you?

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:25.858
Dai: Call me Dai.

00:02:25.892 --> 00:02:27.629
Your turn - same question.

00:02:27.662 --> 00:02:30.534
You're Dai? The... Hero?

00:02:32.104 --> 00:02:33.207
Answer me!

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.244
Dai: Don't make me
do this the hard way...

00:02:35.277 --> 00:02:36.580
Who are you?

00:02:36.613 --> 00:02:38.818
What is that thing, and
what does it want with Leona?

00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:39.786
Easy...

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.022
That's quite...

00:02:41.055 --> 00:02:44.461
a lot of questions to answer
all in one breath, you know...

00:02:50.307 --> 00:02:52.679
I am Goroa, the Drumbler.

00:02:52.712 --> 00:02:56.686
And I'm the caretaker of the
beating heart of Vearn Palace.

00:02:57.388 --> 00:02:58.524
You're the one who controls

00:02:58.557 --> 00:03:00.427
where the palace
goes, aren't you?

00:03:01.797 --> 00:03:04.670
So... then you also
control this monster?

00:03:04.703 --> 00:03:06.205
Why did you take Leona?

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.410
Goroa: Oh,
that's no monster.

00:03:08.443 --> 00:03:11.583
Not entirely, anyway.
What you're looking at...

00:03:11.617 --> 00:03:13.554
is called the
Dark Force Reactor.

00:03:13.587 --> 00:03:16.526
Half beast, half
machine, and all power.

00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:18.630
So, then this thing...

00:03:18.664 --> 00:03:20.367
It's what powers
Vearn Palace?

00:03:20.401 --> 00:03:21.671
Goroa: You're a sharp one.

00:03:21.704 --> 00:03:22.906
That's exactly right.

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:27.749
Like I said, the Dark Force
Reactor is the palace's heart.

00:03:27.782 --> 00:03:30.955
Vearn: It feeds on my Magic
Power, circulating it through

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.797
every corner of our stronghold
like an electric current.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.802
It's a living engine, and
our symbiotic relationship

00:03:37.836 --> 00:03:40.541
has served me well
through many a conquest...

00:03:40.575 --> 00:03:43.380
However, that Kaglimmer
spell the girl conjured

00:03:43.413 --> 00:03:45.885
has disrupted our
magical defenses.

00:03:45.918 --> 00:03:46.887
The Reactor's connection to

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.160
the flow of my Magic
Power has been severed.

00:03:50.194 --> 00:03:52.732
If it's starving
for sustenance,

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:55.304
then perhaps
it's malfunctioned.

00:03:55.337 --> 00:03:57.508
Goroa: Aye, the
beast-half is just hungry.

00:03:57.542 --> 00:03:59.646
That's why it sent
out its tentacles -

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.251
it was hunting for more
Magic Power to feed on.

00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:03.688
Right, of course.

00:04:03.721 --> 00:04:06.994
It went after Leona because
it sensed how powerful she is.

00:04:07.027 --> 00:04:07.996
Dai [thought]: But...

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:09.566
It must sense Popp
and me, too...

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.536
Why didn't it
take us with her?

00:04:12.304 --> 00:04:13.541
Wait, that's it...

00:04:13.574 --> 00:04:16.079
She's carrying
Master Avan's Feathers!

00:04:16.112 --> 00:04:18.283
That means her
Magic Power is doubled.

00:04:18.316 --> 00:04:19.620
With Master gone,

00:04:19.653 --> 00:04:22.959
Leona must look like the biggest
meal ever to this thing.

00:04:24.161 --> 00:04:25.565
Leona!

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:27.535
I think this creature might
be attracted to the Magic Power

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:30.608
in those Feathers
that Master Avan gave you.

00:04:30.642 --> 00:04:31.342
Drop 'em!

00:04:31.375 --> 00:04:33.547
Maybe then it'll let you go!

00:04:33.581 --> 00:04:36.887
Leona: I-I can't... I can't
reach them like this!

00:04:44.001 --> 00:04:45.169
Fine, then...

00:04:45.203 --> 00:04:46.974
I'm just gonna
have to destroy it.

00:04:47.007 --> 00:04:48.042
Now, hold your horses!

00:04:48.075 --> 00:04:50.748
If I let you do that,
King Vearn'll be furious!

00:04:50.782 --> 00:04:53.387
Then get it under
control, right now.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.457
Goroa: That's what
I've been trying to do!

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.062
Don't you understand?
It has a mind of its own.

00:04:58.096 --> 00:04:59.566
The only reason
I can wrangle it...

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.670
is because King
Vearn granted me

00:05:01.704 --> 00:05:04.408
the power to
control supergravity.

00:05:04.441 --> 00:05:07.582
And make no mistake,
I'm using it as we speak!

00:05:07.615 --> 00:05:10.420
Okay... But it's not
doing anything at all.

00:05:10.453 --> 00:05:11.756
Goroa: That just goes to show

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.894
how wildly the
beast is rampaging.

00:05:13.928 --> 00:05:17.836
If I stop... If this Gravity
Pulse of mine goes quiet...

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:19.004
we're done.

00:05:20.274 --> 00:05:22.945
I'm afraid there's no helping
your friend. She's lunch now.

00:05:24.014 --> 00:05:26.620
Goroa: My condolences,
but I've done what I can.

00:05:26.653 --> 00:05:28.423
Normally, a creature
caught in those tentacles

00:05:28.457 --> 00:05:30.528
would already be consumed.

00:05:30.562 --> 00:05:33.901
Really, you should be thanking
me for slowing it down at all.

00:05:35.772 --> 00:05:36.406
Forget it.

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:37.942
I'm doing this my way!

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.660
You okay?

00:05:46.693 --> 00:05:47.494
What the...

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:49.532
It's like I hit
an invisible wall...

00:05:49.566 --> 00:05:51.570
You wanna play like that?

00:05:54.576 --> 00:05:55.945
Goroa [thought]:
Look at that strength.

00:05:55.978 --> 00:05:58.082
He certainly lives
up to his reputation.

00:05:58.115 --> 00:06:01.657
At this rate, he may very
well destroy the Reactor...

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.898
If I don't stop him, I'm due
for the dungeons... or worse.

00:06:07.034 --> 00:06:08.069
I know...

00:06:14.549 --> 00:06:15.652
Dai [thought]: It's no use...

00:06:15.685 --> 00:06:17.889
Nothing's getting
through the forcefield.

00:06:17.923 --> 00:06:18.824
But I have to try...

00:06:18.857 --> 00:06:21.161
This might be
dangerous for Leona...

00:06:22.698 --> 00:06:26.472
But I'll have to cut this beast
in two with an Avan Strash!

00:06:26.506 --> 00:06:27.942
Hold on, Leona...

00:06:27.976 --> 00:06:29.646
I'll get you out of there!

00:06:30.748 --> 00:06:32.551
Avan...

00:06:41.435 --> 00:06:45.077
What's going on?
I feel... So heavy...

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.780
Goroa: [chuckling]

00:06:46.813 --> 00:06:48.885
I hit you with
the Gravity Pulse.

00:06:48.918 --> 00:06:52.224
I take no pleasure
in this, but I had to.

00:06:52.257 --> 00:06:54.028
Although, now
that I think about it,

00:06:54.061 --> 00:06:57.367
I'm under no obligation
to help you or that girl.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.271
In fact, if I stop
the Hero myself,

00:06:59.304 --> 00:07:01.710
I'll wager there's
a handsome reward.

00:07:01.744 --> 00:07:06.485
Maybe it's my chance to finally
get out of life in the bilge.

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:07.888
Dai [thought]: Wait a second.

00:07:07.922 --> 00:07:11.161
If he's using his Gravity
Pulse to hold me down, then...

00:07:14.035 --> 00:07:15.470
Leona: Dai, hurry -

00:07:15.972 --> 00:07:17.440
Leona, no!

00:07:22.017 --> 00:07:23.787
No, no...

00:07:28.496 --> 00:07:30.233
Come on...

00:07:31.703 --> 00:07:34.008
You're quite impressive, lad.

00:07:34.041 --> 00:07:35.978
But I've got you!

00:07:38.951 --> 00:07:41.756
After all, the Dark King
tasked me with keeping that

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:45.229
behemoth of a reactor in
check for a reason, he did.

00:07:45.263 --> 00:07:49.038
I hate to tell you, but your
power is no match for mine.

00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:50.641
Come on... Move...

00:07:50.675 --> 00:07:52.344
Goroa [thought]:
With all that said,

00:07:52.377 --> 00:07:54.982
how exactly should
I finish him off?

00:08:01.295 --> 00:08:03.099
How poetic.

00:08:03.132 --> 00:08:05.136
Dai: Let's go, Dai. Get up.

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:06.439
You have to get up!

00:08:06.472 --> 00:08:09.378
If you don't move,
then Leona will be gone.

00:08:09.412 --> 00:08:11.248
I'm not losing her!

00:08:12.384 --> 00:08:14.321
Goroa: It's too
late to save the girl.

00:08:14.355 --> 00:08:15.658
Now that she's
in the cocoon,

00:08:15.691 --> 00:08:18.229
it'll only take the
Reactor mere moments

00:08:18.263 --> 00:08:20.667
to absorb her life force.

00:08:21.435 --> 00:08:23.139
And as mighty as
you may be, Hero,

00:08:23.172 --> 00:08:25.645
if I run you through with
this enchanted blade,

00:08:25.678 --> 00:08:27.280
I doubt you'll survive.

00:08:27.314 --> 00:08:30.555
Once I've done away with you,
I'll get the reactor behaving,

00:08:30.588 --> 00:08:32.792
and King Vearn will
see what I'm capable of...

00:08:32.825 --> 00:08:35.463
He'll know I can do
whatever I set my mind to,

00:08:35.496 --> 00:08:37.033
and commend me!

00:08:38.937 --> 00:08:42.244
Vearn: To be defeated by
a little grunt like Goroa,

00:08:42.277 --> 00:08:46.452
when he was mere moments away
from the final battle...

00:08:46.486 --> 00:08:48.189
For a Hero like Dai,

00:08:48.223 --> 00:08:51.729
that seems like a rather
underwhelming ending.

00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:57.642
No... This isn't
over until it's over.

00:08:57.675 --> 00:09:00.447
Goroa: Indeed.
That's enough chatter...

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.052
It's time to
finish you for good!

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:09.364
Dai: [roaring]

00:09:09.398 --> 00:09:13.541
[struggling grunts]

00:09:13.574 --> 00:09:15.911
There's no point resisting.

00:09:15.945 --> 00:09:18.950
Be a good lad
and just give it up!

00:09:21.723 --> 00:09:23.794
Dai: Not a chance.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.776
Dai [thought]: Come on...

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.181
Is this it, Dragon Crest?

00:09:34.214 --> 00:09:38.658
Is this... Is this really...
all the strength that I have?

00:09:38.691 --> 00:09:39.992
Because it's not enough.

00:09:40.026 --> 00:09:42.464
I've summoned everything
that I have within me...

00:09:42.497 --> 00:09:45.102
And I won't stand
a chance against Vearn.

00:09:46.806 --> 00:09:51.114
I thought Dragon Knights...
were supposed to be strong...

00:09:51.148 --> 00:09:55.156
But if this is the best I can
do, I guess the truth is,

00:09:55.189 --> 00:09:57.729
we're actually pretty
weak, aren't we?

00:09:57.762 --> 00:09:59.999
All I want is to protect
someone I care about

00:10:00.033 --> 00:10:02.505
and I can't even
get off the ground.

00:10:02.539 --> 00:10:05.611
Where's all the power
that Dad wielded, huh?

00:10:06.947 --> 00:10:08.650
Goroa: Tears of frustration?

00:10:08.684 --> 00:10:11.790
Don't be so hard on yourself.
It's not your fault.

00:10:11.824 --> 00:10:15.063
I just happened to
be smarter than you.

00:10:15.096 --> 00:10:19.471
And now it's time for you
to perish by your own sword!

00:10:19.506 --> 00:10:22.110
Fare thee well, Dai!

00:10:38.108 --> 00:10:39.144
Dai: D-Dad...

00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:51.134
This is when...

00:10:51.703 --> 00:10:53.540
This is when Mom died...

00:10:53.574 --> 00:10:54.909
Isn't it?

00:10:55.644 --> 00:10:58.082
Soala!

00:11:00.486 --> 00:11:01.957
Baran: The life
of a Dragon Knight

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:04.896
is one of never-ending
battle, my son.

00:11:07.969 --> 00:11:09.839
Dad? It's really you...

00:11:10.908 --> 00:11:12.679
You see, throughout
the generations

00:11:12.712 --> 00:11:14.548
that came before us...

00:11:14.582 --> 00:11:16.786
Many a loved one
has met a tragic end

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.126
when they follow us on
our path of destruction.

00:11:20.159 --> 00:11:21.395
It is our curse.

00:11:21.428 --> 00:11:24.702
Sadly, your mother was one
of those taken from us.

00:11:26.271 --> 00:11:29.846
Baran: But... Whatever
the past may be, you are you.

00:11:29.879 --> 00:11:31.917
And this is the present.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.620
Baran: So by your hand,

00:11:33.654 --> 00:11:36.025
I challenge you to
see if you can break

00:11:36.058 --> 00:11:40.333
the curse of the Dragon
Knights, once and for all, Dai!

00:11:41.502 --> 00:11:45.176
Baran: Remember the first
time you rescued Leona.

00:11:45.209 --> 00:11:49.184
You're far greater... than
any ordinary Dragon Knight.

00:11:49.218 --> 00:11:51.824
You carry my soul
along with your own.

00:11:51.857 --> 00:11:55.363
That makes you something
never seen before.

00:11:55.396 --> 00:11:56.633
So rise.

00:11:56.666 --> 00:11:59.304
Stand and fight, my son.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.014
Dai [thought]: Thank you, Dad.

00:12:05.751 --> 00:12:06.987
He's right.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:08.422
The first time
my crest appeared

00:12:08.456 --> 00:12:11.095
was when I rescued
Leona from that Scorpion.

00:12:11.128 --> 00:12:13.733
I have to draw it
out like back then...

00:12:13.767 --> 00:12:16.673
This unknown power
hidden within me...

00:12:16.706 --> 00:12:19.144
It's the only
way to unleash it.

00:12:19.178 --> 00:12:22.952
My crest in one hand...
and Dad's in the other!

00:12:26.325 --> 00:12:31.335
Together, they're more
powerful than gravity.

00:12:31.368 --> 00:12:33.873
[overpowered cry]

00:12:37.615 --> 00:12:40.219
Goroa [thought]:
What... What was that?

00:12:41.522 --> 00:12:44.027
[terrified yell]

00:13:04.535 --> 00:13:06.706
Th... Th-Th-Th...

00:13:06.739 --> 00:13:09.010
It's impossible!

00:13:15.156 --> 00:13:17.461
Dragon Crests on each fist?!

00:13:17.494 --> 00:13:20.233
Never in all history...

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:23.339
Dai [thought]: It worked.
I can't believe it.

00:13:23.372 --> 00:13:25.343
Dad left me his crest...

00:13:25.376 --> 00:13:29.351
Baran: "Although my body
may perish, my soul lives on.

00:13:29.385 --> 00:13:32.056
I will be with you
in the battle ahead.

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:35.864
We shall always be together,
never to part again...

00:13:35.897 --> 00:13:38.737
Now on your feet.
Stand up, Dai."

00:13:38.771 --> 00:13:40.641
Dai [thought]: I didn't
realize it at the time,

00:13:40.674 --> 00:13:44.281
but that was when the power of
Dad's Crest entered my body.

00:13:44.314 --> 00:13:46.786
That's why I recognized
Mom in my dream,

00:13:46.819 --> 00:13:48.924
even though I've never met her.

00:13:48.957 --> 00:13:51.462
It was Dad's soul
trying to reassure me.

00:13:51.495 --> 00:13:55.136
He's been right here
with me... all this time!

00:13:55.169 --> 00:13:58.176
Exactly like he said he'd be.

00:13:58.209 --> 00:14:01.215
[trembling]

00:14:01.248 --> 00:14:05.256
I see. You've
inherited Baran's power.

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:08.229
The combined strength
of two Dragon Knights.

00:14:08.262 --> 00:14:12.505
Twin Dragon Crests.
Truly without precedent.

00:14:12.538 --> 00:14:17.180
C-Curse you!

00:14:18.216 --> 00:14:24.294
[roaring]

00:14:24.327 --> 00:14:25.163
[whimpering]

00:14:25.196 --> 00:14:28.870
Wh-Why isn't my
Gravity Pulse working?!

00:14:28.904 --> 00:14:30.039
[snarling]

00:14:30.541 --> 00:14:33.445
[roaring]

00:14:35.851 --> 00:14:37.220
"Set your mind" on this...

00:14:37.253 --> 00:14:38.288
Crest Beam!

00:14:58.964 --> 00:15:02.136
You blew right through
the reactor's barrier?

00:15:06.713 --> 00:15:11.288
[roaring]

00:15:18.703 --> 00:15:23.646
[pained groan]

00:16:46.078 --> 00:16:48.116
Vearn: Twin Dragon Crests.

00:16:48.149 --> 00:16:50.654
Such a threat has
never existed before.

00:16:50.687 --> 00:16:54.461
That's the fortune telling
of a Reaper for you.

00:16:54.494 --> 00:16:57.100
Their predictions never
fail to come true...

00:16:57.133 --> 00:16:59.470
in the worst way imaginable.

00:17:00.039 --> 00:17:01.441
Leona, where are you?

00:17:03.145 --> 00:17:07.153
Oh, no... Was I
really too late?

00:17:18.777 --> 00:17:20.312
That's a relief...

00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:23.553
Dai: She's okay!

00:17:25.824 --> 00:17:28.328
Wow. That was a
close one... But...

00:17:28.362 --> 00:17:31.535
It looks like she's
totally unharmed.

00:17:35.009 --> 00:17:37.146
Leona... Wake up.

00:17:38.917 --> 00:17:40.252
Dai, I...

00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:44.261
What happened?

00:17:44.294 --> 00:17:45.497
I was scared for a sec.

00:17:45.531 --> 00:17:47.635
Goroa told me that
the Reactor was going to

00:17:47.668 --> 00:17:50.406
absorb your life force
if I didn't do something.

00:17:50.439 --> 00:17:53.278
For a moment there, I thought
I was going to lose you.

00:17:53.312 --> 00:17:56.284
But let me guess: you
took care of it, didn't you?

00:17:57.187 --> 00:17:58.923
Just like old times.

00:17:58.956 --> 00:18:01.829
Yikes. My clothes
are a disaster.

00:18:01.863 --> 00:18:03.933
And I could feel
it taking my energy.

00:18:03.967 --> 00:18:06.104
Like it was
squeezing it out of me.

00:18:06.138 --> 00:18:07.306
If this Reactor thing was

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.578
in the process of
absorbing my Magic Power,

00:18:09.611 --> 00:18:13.152
then I shouldn't even be
able to stand right now...

00:18:13.186 --> 00:18:14.923
So how'd you do it?

00:18:14.956 --> 00:18:16.424
Uh...

00:18:20.399 --> 00:18:22.671
Leona: Dai, could you
turn around for a second?

00:18:22.704 --> 00:18:24.107
Huh? But, why?

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:25.778
It doesn't matter why. Turn!

00:18:25.811 --> 00:18:27.547
Okay, geez.

00:18:30.887 --> 00:18:32.423
Leona: Dai, look.

00:18:35.496 --> 00:18:36.799
Gomechan shrunk?

00:18:36.833 --> 00:18:38.268
Wait, where was he?

00:18:39.271 --> 00:18:42.276
He was sort of...
hiding under my clothes.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:43.713
Under your clothes?

00:18:43.747 --> 00:18:44.715
Where under your clothes?

00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:48.757
None of your business,
and also not the point!

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:51.428
Leona: I think he
protected me somehow...

00:18:51.461 --> 00:18:52.965
It could be that while I was

00:18:52.999 --> 00:18:54.936
trapped inside that
Reactor creature,

00:18:54.969 --> 00:18:59.377
Gomechan was emitting his own
Magic Power the entire time.

00:19:00.246 --> 00:19:02.283
Maybe... that's
what kept that thing

00:19:02.317 --> 00:19:03.820
from absorbing
my life force.

00:19:03.853 --> 00:19:08.129
Makes sense. You think
he shrunk because of that?

00:19:08.162 --> 00:19:10.700
You know... It's not
the first time Gomechan's

00:19:10.734 --> 00:19:13.472
pulled out a surprise
to help us in battle.

00:19:13.506 --> 00:19:17.548
Sometimes, I think he's got a
mysterious power of his own.

00:19:17.581 --> 00:19:19.484
Leona [thought]: It
definitely seems that way.

00:19:19.518 --> 00:19:21.889
First with healing
Dai's stamina,

00:19:21.922 --> 00:19:23.459
then apparently
bringing Popp back

00:19:23.492 --> 00:19:25.764
from the place
between worlds...

00:19:25.798 --> 00:19:27.066
Then that time with Chiu,

00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:29.037
attacking with
a hardened body...

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:32.511
And now, emitting Magic
Power to protect me.

00:19:32.545 --> 00:19:35.884
It's almost like miracles
follow this little guy around.

00:19:38.857 --> 00:19:40.994
Let's just forget it.

00:19:41.028 --> 00:19:42.363
Leona: Better to not
question something

00:19:42.397 --> 00:19:44.033
that's saved our
lives over and over.

00:19:44.067 --> 00:19:49.043
And besides, he's almost even
cuter when he's tiny like this.

00:19:49.077 --> 00:19:52.884
For now, I think we should let
him get his rest and recover.

00:19:56.124 --> 00:19:58.596
I said that was
none of your business!

00:19:59.297 --> 00:20:00.567
I didn't mean to.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.338
How was I supposed to
know what you were doing?

00:20:09.552 --> 00:20:11.154
Dai: Goroa?!

00:20:11.188 --> 00:20:14.595
Aye, lad. You've left
me with no other choice.

00:20:14.628 --> 00:20:16.599
I'll pour all of
my own Magic Power

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:21.643
into the Dark Force Reactor,
and drag you down with me!

00:20:21.676 --> 00:20:23.646
No, stop!
It's not gonna work!

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.251
Goroa: There's no
other option for me.

00:20:26.284 --> 00:20:30.393
I promise you,
I'll destroy you both!

00:20:30.426 --> 00:20:32.230
Vearn: That's enough.

00:20:32.263 --> 00:20:34.067
My... My king?

00:20:34.101 --> 00:20:36.171
Vearn: Stand down, Goroa.

00:20:36.204 --> 00:20:38.910
Even if the Dark Force
Reactor is lost...

00:20:38.944 --> 00:20:41.883
I shall not hold
you responsible.

00:20:41.916 --> 00:20:44.789
It seems as though the
ever-turning wheel of fate

00:20:44.822 --> 00:20:48.763
has sided with the Hero
for the time being.

00:20:48.796 --> 00:20:50.968
Had he climbed the
Tower of Supremacy

00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:52.638
without this challenge,

00:20:52.671 --> 00:20:56.679
even Dai's greatest efforts
would have been no threat to me.

00:20:56.713 --> 00:20:58.616
Other Dark Force
Reactors exist

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:01.522
in the Underworld
should we need one.

00:21:01.555 --> 00:21:04.761
I command you to not
provoke Dai any further!

00:21:05.898 --> 00:21:09.303
Well, Your Majesty, that
might be your command...

00:21:09.337 --> 00:21:13.880
I'm afraid it's too late
for me to turn back now!

00:21:14.849 --> 00:21:16.785
Leona, stay behind me.

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:21.729
Leona [thought]: Hang on...
Two Dragon Crests?!

00:21:25.871 --> 00:21:28.242
And that stance... it's...

00:21:28.275 --> 00:21:29.612
Dai: I'm warning you...

00:21:29.645 --> 00:21:33.151
This isn't gonna be
some ordinary spell.

00:21:33.185 --> 00:21:34.889
This was my Dad's...

00:21:34.922 --> 00:21:37.493
It's the Dragon Knight's...

00:21:37.527 --> 00:21:43.573
greatest and most
unstoppable... ace in the hole!

00:21:45.677 --> 00:21:47.313
Doruora!

00:21:52.992 --> 00:21:56.732
[overwhelmed shriek]

00:23:37.701 --> 00:23:39.705
Narrator: With the Dark
Force Reactor obliterated,

00:23:39.739 --> 00:23:43.379
and its keeper overcome by the
power of the Twin Dragon Crests,

00:23:43.412 --> 00:23:44.715
Dai and Leona make their way

00:23:44.749 --> 00:23:47.120
to the top of the
Tower of Supremacy.

00:23:47.153 --> 00:23:50.860
There the Dark King awaits,
brimming with malevolent fury,

00:23:50.894 --> 00:23:52.932
and intent on
destroying the Hero.

00:23:52.965 --> 00:23:55.937
Dai stands strong,
even as old fears resurface

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:58.776
and the Staff of Edacity
threatens to strike.

00:23:58.809 --> 00:23:59.411
Will he prevail?

00:23:59.444 --> 00:24:00.547
Find out next time on

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:02.952

The Adventure of Dai:
