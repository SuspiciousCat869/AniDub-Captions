WEBVTT

00:01:53.393 --> 00:01:56.634
Uh, guys?
W-What's happening to him?

00:01:56.667 --> 00:01:57.836
Baran's body is...

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:58.904
Hyunckel &amp; Crocodine:
Changing!

00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:08.357
[trembling]

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.964
Is this....
C-Could this actually be...

00:02:11.997 --> 00:02:14.201
a Dragon Knight's true form?

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:16.272
Baran: Indeed.

00:02:16.305 --> 00:02:20.648
The combined power of Dragons,
Darklings, and humans.

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:25.023
The Ultimate Combat Form
of the Dragon Knight...

00:02:25.056 --> 00:02:28.998
A form known as the Dragonoid.

00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:30.367
Dragonoid?!

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.679
Popp: Whoa... What
unbelievable pressure.

00:02:35.712 --> 00:02:38.217
I've never felt anything
this intimidating.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.221
Not even from Hadlar!

00:02:40.254 --> 00:02:42.625
Popp - you have to
get inside the castle.

00:02:42.658 --> 00:02:45.865
There's no way.
I'm fighting, too.

00:02:45.898 --> 00:02:47.536
Don't be stupid.

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.007
You can sense that
energy, can't you?

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.478
Baran's Aura is overwhelming.

00:02:52.512 --> 00:02:56.754
Hyunckel: Besides,
you're out of Magic Power...

00:02:56.787 --> 00:02:58.524
You'll be useless out here!

00:02:58.557 --> 00:02:59.526
Hey, watch it!

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.297
C'mon, Popp. It's not
the time be stubborn.

00:03:02.331 --> 00:03:04.937
I'll support these two.
You have to get moving.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.238
Look after Dai...

00:03:06.272 --> 00:03:07.842
And if anything
happens to us,

00:03:07.875 --> 00:03:11.716
you have to get him as far
away from here as possible!

00:03:15.057 --> 00:03:18.163
Alright. Fine then!

00:03:18.196 --> 00:03:20.266
Popp: Don't any
of you get killed!

00:03:22.873 --> 00:03:24.208
Look out!

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:26.580
[pained yell]

00:03:27.481 --> 00:03:30.253
Popp: [agonizing groan]

00:03:30.855 --> 00:03:31.623
Leona: Popp!

00:03:31.656 --> 00:03:34.128
Striking the
wounded from behind?

00:03:34.161 --> 00:03:35.430
How dare you?!

00:03:35.463 --> 00:03:37.702
Now that I'm in
my Dragonoid form,

00:03:37.735 --> 00:03:39.773
I will stop at
nothing to destroy

00:03:39.806 --> 00:03:43.012
every pitiful enemy
in my line of sight.

00:03:43.046 --> 00:03:45.316
Just like that
of a Demonic Beast,

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.391
this power is simply too
strong for me to hold back.

00:03:49.424 --> 00:03:54.035
Baran: Wounded or not,
I have no mercy to spare.

00:03:54.068 --> 00:03:56.438
But can you blame me?

00:03:56.472 --> 00:04:00.280
You reopened
the scar on my heart.

00:04:01.148 --> 00:04:04.823
You have brought
this upon yourselves!

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.980
Curse you!

00:04:20.688 --> 00:04:23.192
[pained groan]

00:04:23.226 --> 00:04:24.696
Crocodine!

00:04:24.996 --> 00:04:25.998
Woosh.

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:29.639
Hyunckel: He's... too...

00:04:32.344 --> 00:04:35.551
Popp: He's going to wipe
us out at this rate!

00:04:38.423 --> 00:04:40.662
Even at our strongest-

00:04:40.695 --> 00:04:44.301
there's no way we could beat
anything with this much power.

00:04:44.335 --> 00:04:47.708
It's overwhelming - I've
never seen anything like it.

00:04:47.742 --> 00:04:50.380
Crocodine: He truly has
the strength of a dragon

00:04:50.414 --> 00:04:53.286
and the Magic Power
of a Darkling.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.893
You've seen nothing
of my power yet!

00:04:57.895 --> 00:04:59.331
[alarmed breaths]

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.043
Baran: I'll erase
you all in an instant...

00:05:05.077 --> 00:05:08.183
This is a spell
of purification.

00:05:08.216 --> 00:05:12.157
One I can only cast
in this form: Doruora!

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.995
We... have to run.

00:05:14.028 --> 00:05:15.698
No use. We can't move.

00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:20.440
Stop it, Baran. Don't give
yourself over to violence!

00:05:20.473 --> 00:05:23.346
Baran: Your words
mean nothing now.

00:05:24.549 --> 00:05:27.487
Once I take the
form of the Dragonoid...

00:05:27.521 --> 00:05:31.062
I cannot turn back until
you've all been destroyed.

00:05:31.095 --> 00:05:33.466
Now, begone!

00:05:47.662 --> 00:05:48.764
Dino...

00:05:51.002 --> 00:05:52.437
Dai.

00:06:10.174 --> 00:06:12.444
No!

00:06:17.488 --> 00:06:19.893
What was that?
Was it a dream?

00:06:19.926 --> 00:06:24.235
No, it... it was far
more vivid than any dream.

00:06:24.268 --> 00:06:25.403
Was it a vision?!

00:06:25.437 --> 00:06:27.141
Gomechan: [chirping]

00:06:27.174 --> 00:06:29.144
Merle: Dai... Popp...

00:06:32.986 --> 00:06:34.121
N-No!

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:38.797
We can't... We can't let
Dai leave with that thing.

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:43.607
Get back to the
castle! Dai; run!

00:06:44.943 --> 00:06:46.613
Come on, go!

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:59.138
Dai: Are you the one
who called for me?

00:06:59.171 --> 00:07:00.574
I am.

00:07:01.476 --> 00:07:04.148
So then, who are you?

00:07:04.181 --> 00:07:07.588
I am your father.
You don't need to be afraid.

00:07:08.824 --> 00:07:13.199
But you... you don't
look like me at all.

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:16.472
You look... like a monster.

00:07:18.476 --> 00:07:19.846
I must admit.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.952
You are right about that,
my son. This form is not human.

00:07:22.986 --> 00:07:26.727
It would appear that you
take more after your mother.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.201
I doubt that you can
become a Dragonoid. But...

00:07:36.847 --> 00:07:39.117
Baran: Remove that headband.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.781
I get it... I see!

00:07:53.814 --> 00:07:56.151
You're telling
the truth, aren't you?

00:07:56.185 --> 00:07:59.893
The only proof we need is
the crest upon our foreheads.

00:07:59.927 --> 00:08:03.099
It is a symbol of
the bond between us.

00:08:03.132 --> 00:08:08.443
While our forms may be
different, we are still family.

00:08:08.476 --> 00:08:12.117
You know that it's true.
I am your father.

00:08:15.457 --> 00:08:17.060
My father...

00:08:24.075 --> 00:08:25.744
All: Popp!

00:08:34.829 --> 00:08:35.965
Move it.

00:08:35.998 --> 00:08:38.770
What can a piece
of trash like you do?

00:08:40.842 --> 00:08:44.682
Well, nothing.
I know that already.

00:08:44.716 --> 00:08:47.354
But I... I still
need to fight.

00:08:47.387 --> 00:08:52.130
I'm the only one left here...
The last one standing!

00:08:52.163 --> 00:08:55.905
Hyunckel: Don't, Popp.
Don't challenge him.

00:08:55.938 --> 00:08:57.340
He's right.

00:08:57.373 --> 00:08:58.977
I'll crush you.

00:09:00.413 --> 00:09:02.719
If you attack me in this form,

00:09:02.752 --> 00:09:06.125
then I will respond
with great brutality,

00:09:06.159 --> 00:09:07.862
and everyone but my son...

00:09:07.895 --> 00:09:11.736
every single person here,
will be laid to waste

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:15.309
no matter how weak
your attack may be.

00:09:16.245 --> 00:09:17.748
This is your last chance.

00:09:17.782 --> 00:09:21.055
Dino may have brought forth
what remains of my humanity,

00:09:21.088 --> 00:09:22.692
but it's too late.

00:09:22.726 --> 00:09:26.198
Hand him over to me.
Do it peacefully.

00:09:27.467 --> 00:09:29.972
Excuse me, mister.
You're in the way.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.041
Huh?

00:09:31.075 --> 00:09:33.613
That man over
there is my father.

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:36.953
But, Dai...

00:09:37.855 --> 00:09:38.857
What?

00:09:38.891 --> 00:09:41.930
Father or not,
you can't have him!

00:09:41.963 --> 00:09:43.868
I'll never let
you have our Dai.

00:09:43.901 --> 00:09:46.606
Not now, not ever!
You hear me?

00:09:47.174 --> 00:09:49.145
"Our Dai," you say?

00:09:49.178 --> 00:09:53.119
That's right! Without him,
Leona would be dead.

00:09:53.152 --> 00:09:54.923
Popp: And if they
hadn't fought Dai,

00:09:54.956 --> 00:09:57.862
Crocodine and Hyunckel
would still be evil!

00:09:57.895 --> 00:10:00.701
Popp: And... And me...

00:10:00.734 --> 00:10:04.943
If I hadn't met Dai,
I'd still be running away.

00:10:04.976 --> 00:10:09.853
I'd still be some coward.
All talk, useless...

00:10:09.886 --> 00:10:12.992
worthless to everyone I know!

00:10:13.025 --> 00:10:16.766
Our lives were changed by Dai.

00:10:16.799 --> 00:10:21.041
It's thanks to him that
we even made it this far.

00:10:21.075 --> 00:10:24.047
He's the one who
lifts us all up!

00:10:25.249 --> 00:10:29.024
For him to... become
an enemy to humans...

00:10:29.057 --> 00:10:32.732
For him to just disappear
completely from our lives...

00:10:32.765 --> 00:10:36.739
I... I'd rather die
before that happens!

00:10:39.645 --> 00:10:42.150
Then death it will have to be.

00:10:48.597 --> 00:10:49.933
It's no good.

00:10:49.966 --> 00:10:54.075
There isn't a single shred
of humanity left inside him.

00:10:54.108 --> 00:10:55.677
Curses!

00:10:56.245 --> 00:10:57.681
Popp, wait!

00:11:00.555 --> 00:11:02.190
Popp [thought]:
What do I do?

00:11:02.224 --> 00:11:05.964
I've got no Magic Power
or weapons or items...

00:11:05.998 --> 00:11:08.737
All I've got is my fists.

00:11:08.771 --> 00:11:11.610
Isn't there anything
else I can try?

00:11:11.643 --> 00:11:14.047
Think... Think!

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.922
If I don't act, he's
going to take Dai away.

00:11:17.955 --> 00:11:21.195
Master Avan...
What would you do?

00:11:21.228 --> 00:11:25.137
How would you fight at
a time like this, Master?

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:26.773
Come on!

00:11:29.579 --> 00:11:31.148
Popp [thought]:
That's right...

00:11:31.182 --> 00:11:34.020
There's still one
thing that I can do.

00:11:47.481 --> 00:11:48.950
Popp [thought]:
That's right...

00:11:48.984 --> 00:11:52.191
There's still one
thing that I can do.

00:11:52.224 --> 00:11:54.829
But if it works, I...

00:11:59.906 --> 00:12:01.743
Popp: Don't worry.

00:12:01.776 --> 00:12:04.247
I'm gonna end
this thing real quick.

00:12:04.281 --> 00:12:05.249
Huh?

00:12:06.786 --> 00:12:09.024
Hold on to that
bandana, will you?

00:12:09.057 --> 00:12:11.696
I've had it since
I was five years old.

00:12:11.729 --> 00:12:13.834
It's kind of my
trademark of mine.

00:12:13.867 --> 00:12:15.905
But, me? Why, mister?

00:12:15.938 --> 00:12:18.075
Listen... Just don't lose it.

00:12:23.687 --> 00:12:25.857
He's fighting him bare-handed?

00:12:25.891 --> 00:12:27.995
Hyunckel: Popp,
are you insane?

00:12:28.028 --> 00:12:29.732
Baran [thought]:
I cannot bear to watch

00:12:29.766 --> 00:12:32.504
such a pathetic
suicide attack.

00:12:32.538 --> 00:12:35.376
I'll shatter him
with a single blow.

00:12:39.585 --> 00:12:41.121
Th-That's...

00:12:43.594 --> 00:12:45.063
Get off!

00:12:45.096 --> 00:12:47.968
Curse you! How can your
grip be so strong?!

00:12:48.002 --> 00:12:49.204
[struggling grunts]

00:12:49.237 --> 00:12:50.473
Popp: You'll see!

00:12:50.507 --> 00:12:55.083
All of my life energy is being
focused through my hands...

00:12:55.116 --> 00:12:57.922
So I can't let you
pull them out.

00:12:57.955 --> 00:12:59.625
Baran: You... You're not...

00:12:59.659 --> 00:13:03.332
He... He's...
casting... Megante!

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:06.840
Baran: If you use Megante,
it will kill you!

00:13:06.873 --> 00:13:10.514
I-I know - and if
my luck holds out,

00:13:10.547 --> 00:13:12.450
we'll both be blown to pieces.

00:13:12.484 --> 00:13:15.089
Just like my master!

00:13:15.122 --> 00:13:17.762
Hyunckel: Stop it!
This is crazy!

00:13:17.795 --> 00:13:18.697
[grim chuckle]

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.466
I idolized Master Avan,

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.840
but this was one spell
I never wanted to use.

00:13:23.873 --> 00:13:26.580
Crocodine: You don't know
if it'll work on Baran!

00:13:26.613 --> 00:13:28.282
Oh, it's going to work.

00:13:28.316 --> 00:13:30.486
The Draconic
Aura might be strong,

00:13:30.521 --> 00:13:35.163
but it can still be broken by
even more powerful energy.

00:13:35.196 --> 00:13:38.335
Baran even said so himself-
isn't that right?

00:13:38.369 --> 00:13:40.941
He couldn't possibly
break the Aura!

00:13:40.974 --> 00:13:43.814
It's an honor...
To make this sacrifice!

00:13:43.847 --> 00:13:46.986
With you out of the picture,
there's a chance.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.961
A chance for all of humanity
to survive and live on!

00:13:50.995 --> 00:13:54.001
So I don't think I could ask
for a better reason to die!

00:13:54.034 --> 00:13:56.573
No, don't. Come on...
Please, Popp!

00:13:56.606 --> 00:13:59.044
Stop! Don't do it, Popp!

00:13:59.078 --> 00:14:01.281
[struggling grunts]

00:14:03.252 --> 00:14:07.193
Dai [thought]: This...
This has happened before.

00:14:07.227 --> 00:14:13.038
I remember... The feeling that
came with it - the sadness...

00:14:13.072 --> 00:14:16.946
I have to... I can't
let this happen...

00:14:16.979 --> 00:14:19.919
I have to do something, but...

00:14:19.953 --> 00:14:23.325
[struggling grunts]

00:14:23.358 --> 00:14:26.131
He's trying-
to rip himself free!

00:14:26.766 --> 00:14:30.774
Baran: [roaring]

00:14:30.807 --> 00:14:33.914
Hey. Leona...

00:14:33.947 --> 00:14:39.057
Popp: Hyunckel...
Crocodine... Everyone...

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:41.228
You'll have to
take it from here.

00:14:43.432 --> 00:14:44.335
P-Popp!

00:14:44.368 --> 00:14:46.773
And make something
up for Maam, would you?

00:14:46.807 --> 00:14:48.075
Popp, no!

00:14:55.624 --> 00:14:57.026
Dai...

00:15:06.211 --> 00:15:07.413
Dai...

00:15:11.689 --> 00:15:13.927
Get that sad
look off your face.

00:15:13.961 --> 00:15:18.636
It's not the last thing
I want to see. Got it?

00:15:22.979 --> 00:15:25.249
See you later, pal.

00:15:25.282 --> 00:15:27.822
We've been through
quite a bit...

00:15:27.855 --> 00:15:29.224
It's been fun.

00:15:30.728 --> 00:15:32.430
But my...

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:44.722
My adventure... ends here.

00:15:44.756 --> 00:15:50.934
[roaring]

00:15:50.967 --> 00:15:52.538
Popp: Megante!

00:15:59.384 --> 00:16:03.660
Popp! No!

00:16:14.314 --> 00:16:16.151
Y-You fool!

00:16:17.287 --> 00:16:21.796
Dai: I remember...
I remember it all, Popp!

00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:26.572
Because I was so weak...
you... you...

00:16:28.109 --> 00:16:32.718
I'm sorry! Don't go!

00:16:32.752 --> 00:16:33.853
Dai!

00:16:33.887 --> 00:16:38.229
Dai: Popp!

00:16:38.262 --> 00:16:40.399
Has his memory returned?

00:16:40.433 --> 00:16:44.374
Hyunckel: Perhaps...
But the price was far too high.

00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:15.469
W-What?!

00:17:22.518 --> 00:17:26.659
N-No! Even after Popp
sacrificed himself?

00:17:26.693 --> 00:17:30.534
The Megante spell really
had no effect on him?!

00:17:30.567 --> 00:17:32.838
I might have taken
substantial damage

00:17:32.872 --> 00:17:35.442
from a properly
focused Megante.

00:17:35.476 --> 00:17:38.884
But, this one's lack of
experience spared me.

00:17:38.917 --> 00:17:43.125
Just as he channeled all of
his life energy and detonated,

00:17:43.159 --> 00:17:47.834
this poor fool let his guard
down. His grip weakened.

00:17:49.304 --> 00:17:51.241
And so in that final moment,

00:17:51.274 --> 00:17:54.214
I managed to break free
of your weak friend.

00:17:54.247 --> 00:17:56.552
How could this happen?

00:18:02.096 --> 00:18:04.635
Baran: A meaningless death.

00:18:06.237 --> 00:18:07.775
Curse... you!

00:18:07.808 --> 00:18:10.179
How could you?!

00:18:10.212 --> 00:18:10.948
[furious roar]

00:18:10.981 --> 00:18:12.551
Gomechan...

00:18:15.323 --> 00:18:17.761
Gomechan, don't. Stop it!

00:18:26.345 --> 00:18:27.781
Begone!

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.305
Dai: Enough... No more.

00:18:42.177 --> 00:18:44.915
Stop hurting my friends!

00:18:45.584 --> 00:18:47.186
Dino...

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:50.827
It seems you really have
regained your memories.

00:18:50.861 --> 00:18:54.902
Incredible... I thought
I'd thoroughly erased them.

00:18:54.935 --> 00:18:58.643
Dai: If you really are my
dad, why are you doing this?

00:18:58.676 --> 00:19:02.518
You've done all this damage-
you've hurt and killed people...

00:19:02.551 --> 00:19:03.185
and for what?!

00:19:03.218 --> 00:19:04.555
Silence, boy!

00:19:04.588 --> 00:19:07.494
It is my mission to destroy
humanity and it's allies.

00:19:07.528 --> 00:19:11.402
You are my son, understand?
You will obey me!

00:19:11.435 --> 00:19:14.207
I won't!

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.981
You're right that sometimes
humans can be cruel.

00:19:18.015 --> 00:19:19.351
They can be selfish,

00:19:19.384 --> 00:19:23.559
they can bully, and
they can discriminate.

00:19:23.593 --> 00:19:27.066
But I know that some of them
aren't like that at all.

00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:28.704
I've seen it.

00:19:28.737 --> 00:19:31.307
Everyone is trying
to do the best they can

00:19:31.341 --> 00:19:33.713
in the times
they have to live in.

00:19:33.747 --> 00:19:34.882
Because...

00:19:36.519 --> 00:19:39.625
Because that's who Popp was!

00:19:43.065 --> 00:19:44.234
[angry roar]

00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:46.005
[pained cry]

00:19:46.038 --> 00:19:47.675
He's trying it again!

00:19:47.708 --> 00:19:51.348
[pained cry]

00:19:51.381 --> 00:19:52.818
Baran: Trust me, my son.

00:19:52.851 --> 00:19:55.857
There's no reason to
remember such trash...

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:59.999
This time, I'll erase
your memories completely!

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:01.234
You monster.

00:20:01.268 --> 00:20:03.339
Baran: Now forget
everything, Dino...

00:20:03.372 --> 00:20:06.211
And become my true son!

00:20:07.447 --> 00:20:09.985
Dai [thought]: No, I...

00:20:10.019 --> 00:20:13.425
I won't forget
Popp ever again.

00:20:14.729 --> 00:20:17.133
I'll never forget him!

00:20:17.167 --> 00:20:18.970
It's just like last time!

00:20:19.003 --> 00:20:21.241
Is there nothing we can do?!

00:20:21.809 --> 00:20:24.515
[struggling grunt]

00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:28.724
Merle [thought]: Popp sacrificed
himself and fought bravely...

00:20:28.757 --> 00:20:30.861
and I just did nothing.

00:20:30.894 --> 00:20:32.998
Please, gods...

00:20:33.933 --> 00:20:36.572
Dai: [struggling grunt]

00:20:36.606 --> 00:20:39.711
God of Dragons,
lend your strength!

00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:45.591
Don't resist. Your entire
mind will be wiped.

00:20:45.624 --> 00:20:49.665
Dai [thought]: I won't
give in. I'm me...

00:20:49.698 --> 00:20:52.971
I'm Dai, the Hero!

00:20:55.376 --> 00:20:58.348
Even now, you would
resist your father?

00:20:58.382 --> 00:21:00.787
You ungrateful brat.

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.691
Dai: You're not...

00:21:02.724 --> 00:21:04.962
You're not...

00:21:04.996 --> 00:21:07.834
You are not my dad!

00:21:11.208 --> 00:21:14.681
[roaring]

00:21:16.218 --> 00:21:17.521
Baran [thought]: What?

00:21:17.554 --> 00:21:20.994
He struck me while I was
shielded by my Draconic Aura?!

00:21:26.205 --> 00:21:27.641
I'll be...

00:21:31.849 --> 00:21:34.822
Hyunckel: Dai's
crest is on his fist?

00:21:34.855 --> 00:21:39.063
Baran [thought]: How...
Impossible. This can't be!

00:21:39.097 --> 00:21:41.869
Throughout thousands of years
of Dragon Knight history,

00:21:41.902 --> 00:21:44.207
for the light of the
crest to appear anywhere

00:21:44.241 --> 00:21:46.178
other than the forehead...

00:21:46.211 --> 00:21:48.415
It's never happened before.

00:21:50.687 --> 00:21:52.891
Could it be...

00:21:52.924 --> 00:21:55.163
The human spirit?

00:21:55.196 --> 00:21:57.767
Is this Soala's will?!

00:23:38.002 --> 00:23:40.039
Narrator: With the
Dragon Crest on his fist,

00:23:40.072 --> 00:23:43.478
Dai unleashes his
fury against his father.

00:23:43.513 --> 00:23:45.315
But the flames
of Baran's rage

00:23:45.349 --> 00:23:47.754
are stoked by his
son's retaliation...

00:23:47.787 --> 00:23:52.598
And soon Teran Kingdom trembles
as the Dragon Knights clash.

00:23:52.631 --> 00:23:55.135
The greatest battle
in history begins...

00:23:55.168 --> 00:23:59.277
Next time on Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:23:59.311 --> 00:24:02.517
"A Father and Son Clash".
