WEBVTT

00:01:50.922 --> 00:01:53.426
Zamza: [victorious chuckle]

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:55.998
And now it's your
turn to behold.

00:01:56.032 --> 00:02:02.444
So observe the strength of over
a hundred monsters combined...

00:02:05.484 --> 00:02:10.928
Zamza: The power of the
ultimate Superior Being!

00:02:10.962 --> 00:02:14.168
[snarling]

00:02:26.927 --> 00:02:29.666
[roaring]

00:02:30.802 --> 00:02:32.404
He did it...

00:02:32.438 --> 00:02:34.509
I can't believe it's real.

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:38.216
[powerful howl]

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.426
Now... Little Hero Dai.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.468
You have been selected
for the honor of serving as

00:02:47.502 --> 00:02:51.810
the Super Being
Zamza's first opponent.

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:54.582
Zamza: You're welcome.

00:02:55.618 --> 00:03:00.461
[laughing]

00:03:00.494 --> 00:03:02.264
No way!

00:03:06.172 --> 00:03:07.341
He's fast.

00:03:07.374 --> 00:03:10.313
How can something
that big be so fast?!

00:03:17.127 --> 00:03:21.436
Oh. Impressive.
Yes, yes, not bad at all.

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:24.108
Dai [thought]: He's
way stronger than before.

00:03:24.141 --> 00:03:25.711
At this rate...

00:03:30.287 --> 00:03:31.723
Dai [thought]: Oh, no!

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.230
[struggling grunts]

00:03:35.263 --> 00:03:36.466
This isn't good.

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:38.370
Dai pushed himself too hard,

00:03:38.403 --> 00:03:40.708
and now he's already
completely burned out.

00:03:40.742 --> 00:03:42.813
What on earth do
you mean, young man?

00:03:42.846 --> 00:03:43.847
The power of his crest,

00:03:43.881 --> 00:03:46.721
it can only be used for
a short amount of time.

00:03:46.754 --> 00:03:47.955
King Romos: So, then...

00:03:50.026 --> 00:03:52.130
[chuckling]

00:03:52.164 --> 00:03:54.969
I'm hungry - and
you look delicious.

00:03:59.044 --> 00:04:00.748
Popp: A mouth on his stomach?

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.954
Are you kidding me with this?!

00:04:03.988 --> 00:04:05.792
Dai!

00:04:05.825 --> 00:04:06.827
[weakening grunts]

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.766
Now, you will nourish me...

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.469
Young Dragon Knight.

00:04:11.504 --> 00:04:13.774
[struggling grunts]

00:04:15.077 --> 00:04:17.815
[roaring]

00:04:31.744 --> 00:04:32.778
No...

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.593
My strength...

00:04:39.626 --> 00:04:40.794
It's gone...

00:04:42.264 --> 00:04:43.800
No, Dai!

00:04:45.436 --> 00:04:47.775
Zamza: It was
foolish to resist.

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:50.581
But it looks like
you finally learned.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.640
You like that?

00:05:06.212 --> 00:05:07.616
How is this little boy

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:10.922
able to cast such a
concentrated Sizz spell?!

00:05:10.955 --> 00:05:12.024
Popp: Now...

00:05:12.057 --> 00:05:14.394
Kafrizz!

00:05:18.403 --> 00:05:20.040
All right. Get Dai!

00:05:20.073 --> 00:05:23.146
Chiu: [trembling]

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:24.616
Popp [thought]:
Who can blame him?

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.022
Zamza's made from the strongest
parts of all kinds of monsters.

00:05:28.055 --> 00:05:31.730
Chiu instinctively knows
he doesn't stand a chance.

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:35.672
Okay. You guys
look after the king.

00:05:35.705 --> 00:05:36.573
Both: Right.

00:05:39.245 --> 00:05:42.652
Chiu [thought]: Why can't
I stop my tail from shaking?!

00:05:45.157 --> 00:05:46.560
Popp: Hang in there, pal!

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.112
Zamza: You're a much
stronger Mage than you look.

00:05:56.146 --> 00:06:00.453
Not many of your kind can cast
Heat-type spells at your level.

00:06:00.486 --> 00:06:03.961
I think you will make
for a very good specimen.

00:06:03.995 --> 00:06:05.163
But how?!

00:06:05.197 --> 00:06:08.436
I thought Dai already destroyed
this freak's giant claw?!

00:06:11.142 --> 00:06:13.914
Popp: And he's already
healing from my spells, too.

00:06:13.947 --> 00:06:15.584
Zamza: I told you.

00:06:15.618 --> 00:06:19.391
A Superior Being like me
is the ultimate monster.

00:06:19.424 --> 00:06:22.497
My perfected body is
capable of restoring itself

00:06:22.532 --> 00:06:25.872
from any damage it takes.

00:06:25.905 --> 00:06:30.113
This version of the Being is
already ninety-percent complete.

00:06:30.146 --> 00:06:31.884
The only skill I still need

00:06:31.917 --> 00:06:34.656
is the ability to
cast magic spells.

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:41.937
But I can complete my
research after defeating

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.709
the Hero and his
pitiful little allies.

00:06:45.244 --> 00:06:46.713
You wish.

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:50.420
[pained groan]

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:55.898
Popp [thought]: He fired
a focused blast of his Aura.

00:06:55.932 --> 00:06:59.906
It's like Crocodine's
Beast King Redemption Blast!

00:07:00.641 --> 00:07:02.110
[worried breaths]

00:07:04.047 --> 00:07:07.622
Zamza: [chuckling]

00:07:07.656 --> 00:07:10.160
You'd do well to remember.

00:07:10.193 --> 00:07:12.532
Interrupting a
wild animal's meal

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:15.069
will incur it's beastly wrath.

00:07:16.172 --> 00:07:18.810
[menacing cackle]

00:07:21.516 --> 00:07:22.985
That's enough.

00:07:26.894 --> 00:07:28.730
Stop it!

00:07:29.431 --> 00:07:31.135
[falling yell]

00:07:32.572 --> 00:07:35.511
Dai... He got Dai, too?!

00:07:35.544 --> 00:07:37.615
Mr. Ghost: You'd better hurry.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.090
[satisfied chuckle]

00:07:42.123 --> 00:07:44.161
That was nice.

00:07:44.195 --> 00:07:47.736
Soldier: This can't be.
It's like a nightmare.

00:07:47.769 --> 00:07:50.708
He swallowed the Hero whole.

00:07:50.741 --> 00:07:51.810
Oh, Dai.

00:07:55.249 --> 00:07:58.924
Chiu: That demon.
I've had enough.

00:07:58.957 --> 00:08:00.226
Let me at him!

00:08:02.464 --> 00:08:04.502
[laughing]

00:08:04.536 --> 00:08:06.673
I may have swallowed
your friend alive,

00:08:06.707 --> 00:08:10.246
but my stomach creates
a powerful digestive fluid.

00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:13.319
He will be
dissolved in minutes.

00:08:13.352 --> 00:08:14.655
Popp: Damnit!

00:08:17.729 --> 00:08:20.300
Why do you bother resisting?

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:22.137
I'm giving you an opportunity.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:26.513
Die here or live a while
longer as a test specimen.

00:08:26.546 --> 00:08:30.655
Popp: Don't be stupid.
I won't take either!

00:08:30.688 --> 00:08:36.098
Oh? Well, if memory serves...

00:08:36.131 --> 00:08:40.039
I already have a mage
trapped in my bio-prison.

00:08:41.175 --> 00:08:42.477
And so be it.

00:08:42.511 --> 00:08:44.181
I have enough.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.522
You can throw it all away.

00:08:47.555 --> 00:08:50.393
Just like your
"hero" friend did!

00:08:50.426 --> 00:08:51.830
Chiu: Hold it!

00:08:55.772 --> 00:08:57.875
Beast of the Dark Army...

00:08:58.476 --> 00:08:59.645
Huh?!

00:09:00.514 --> 00:09:02.652
Your reign of
terror ends right now!

00:09:02.685 --> 00:09:05.792
You're still here,
you foolish rat?

00:09:05.825 --> 00:09:06.960
Chiu: You better believe it.

00:09:06.994 --> 00:09:09.331
I'll give you one
chance to apologize.

00:09:09.364 --> 00:09:11.034
If you don't want
me to hurt you,

00:09:11.068 --> 00:09:13.774
you'll surrender
and free everybody!

00:09:13.807 --> 00:09:17.247
That idiot. He can't
seriously think he'll win.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:22.391
[roaring laughter]

00:09:22.424 --> 00:09:24.227
I think you've lost your mind.

00:09:24.261 --> 00:09:26.298
Didn't you just
watch me defeat

00:09:26.331 --> 00:09:29.271
the legendary Hero,
you insect?

00:09:31.008 --> 00:09:32.912
Chiu [thought]:
Settle down, tail!

00:09:32.946 --> 00:09:36.586
Otherwise, I'll have
to bite you off.

00:09:37.956 --> 00:09:41.663
I'm going to rescue the
legendary hero - just watch!

00:09:43.032 --> 00:09:45.103
Here goes!

00:09:45.137 --> 00:09:47.040
No, don't! You fool!

00:09:47.074 --> 00:09:49.946
[roaring]

00:09:52.417 --> 00:09:54.287
Did you really
think that would work?!

00:09:54.321 --> 00:09:57.695
You don't have a chance against
a giant monster like this!

00:09:57.728 --> 00:10:01.235
You have to run - get out
of here while you still can!

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.040
[pained groan]

00:10:05.344 --> 00:10:06.278
No!

00:10:08.282 --> 00:10:09.184
Again!

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.196
You hear me?! Hey!
This isn't your fight!

00:10:18.202 --> 00:10:20.040
Popp: Chiu!

00:10:20.073 --> 00:10:23.078
Not Popp...
and Chiu, as well?

00:10:28.757 --> 00:10:31.797
Gomez: It's no use.
Give it up.

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.067
Gomez: Even my might
couldn't do anything.

00:10:34.101 --> 00:10:36.706
So what can your
frail arms do?

00:10:36.739 --> 00:10:37.708
But they're...

00:10:37.741 --> 00:10:39.344
Baloria: It's not
just strength.

00:10:39.378 --> 00:10:41.749
Even my sword was useless.

00:10:41.783 --> 00:10:44.322
Stangul: My whip
didn't work either.

00:10:44.355 --> 00:10:45.691
Fobster: Or my spells.

00:10:45.724 --> 00:10:48.162
I hate to say it,
but it seems like this thing

00:10:48.196 --> 00:10:51.134
can absorb whatever
we throw at it.

00:10:51.168 --> 00:10:53.841
So there's no
escaping from here?

00:10:53.874 --> 00:10:55.645
No, it's hopeless.

00:10:55.678 --> 00:10:57.146
Maam: What's with you?

00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:59.653
Maam: All you tough men...

00:10:59.686 --> 00:11:01.657
Just giving up already?

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:03.226
I'm not quitting.

00:11:03.259 --> 00:11:04.461
My friends are...

00:11:04.494 --> 00:11:07.334
My friends are out there
trying to fight that monster.

00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:09.271
I can't just do nothing!

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:13.714
Mr. Ghost: That won't work.

00:11:13.747 --> 00:11:16.619
You're the only one
who can escape this peril.

00:11:16.653 --> 00:11:20.594
If you utilize the power you've
gained through your training,

00:11:20.628 --> 00:11:23.700
I know with certainty
that you can break free.

00:11:23.733 --> 00:11:25.336
Wait a sec...

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:26.739
Are you...

00:11:28.443 --> 00:11:29.845
What now?

00:11:30.515 --> 00:11:32.317
Larba: My body feels numb!

00:11:32.351 --> 00:11:42.070
[coughing]

00:11:52.157 --> 00:11:55.162
Curse you.
You annoying rodent!

00:11:59.505 --> 00:12:00.741
Chiu: Again!

00:12:01.709 --> 00:12:03.814
Popp [thought]: How is
he still getting up?

00:12:03.847 --> 00:12:07.220
Could I do that?
Could the old me?

00:12:07.253 --> 00:12:10.561
How do you face an enemy that
you know you can't beat-

00:12:10.594 --> 00:12:12.698
when the odds are impossible?

00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:16.004
I know I couldn't.
There's no way.

00:12:17.508 --> 00:12:19.879
Popp [thought]: You've
earned some respect, Ratty.

00:12:27.729 --> 00:12:29.599
Popp [thought]:
He's breathing?

00:12:29.633 --> 00:12:31.001
That's it!

00:12:31.035 --> 00:12:33.774
He's breathing through the
mouth on his stomach, as well!

00:12:33.807 --> 00:12:35.309
In that case...

00:12:39.485 --> 00:12:40.688
Ah, great.

00:12:40.721 --> 00:12:44.427
You're the last person in world
I want seeing me like this.

00:12:45.129 --> 00:12:46.231
O-Oh really?

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:48.570
I'm just impressed
that you didn't run.

00:12:48.603 --> 00:12:49.506
That takes guts.

00:12:49.539 --> 00:12:51.408
Hah! Well, that's rude.

00:12:51.442 --> 00:12:54.749
Only the worst kind of trash
would abandon their friends.

00:12:54.783 --> 00:12:56.819
An absolute coward!

00:12:58.089 --> 00:13:00.026
Popp [thought]:
Don't remind me.

00:13:01.563 --> 00:13:02.832
Hey, Ratty.

00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:05.538
I've come up with
a plan to rescue Dai.

00:13:05.571 --> 00:13:06.906
Wanna help?

00:13:08.108 --> 00:13:09.946
Dunno - is your plan any good?

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.817
Listen, the mouth...

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:13.920
The mouth on his
stomach is gonna open.

00:13:13.953 --> 00:13:15.289
When it does,

00:13:15.322 --> 00:13:17.561
I need you to hit him with
all of your strength, okay?

00:13:17.595 --> 00:13:19.633
The shock just
might push Dai out.

00:13:19.666 --> 00:13:21.870
Can you even hear yourself?

00:13:21.903 --> 00:13:23.372
That's nuts!

00:13:23.405 --> 00:13:24.407
[grim chuckle]

00:13:26.445 --> 00:13:29.652
I don't have time to
keep playing with you two

00:13:29.685 --> 00:13:32.290
I'll finish you
both in a single blow!

00:13:32.323 --> 00:13:34.896
Popp [thought]: An ordinary
spell isn't going to damage him.

00:13:34.929 --> 00:13:36.800
I don't want to use
an enemy's ability,

00:13:36.833 --> 00:13:40.039
but it might
be my only option.

00:13:40.073 --> 00:13:43.178
Popp: Five Finger Flares!

00:14:01.182 --> 00:14:04.555
Popp: Five Finger Flares!

00:14:06.392 --> 00:14:07.393
What?!

00:14:13.339 --> 00:14:14.609
I did it!

00:14:14.642 --> 00:14:16.813
[pained roaring]

00:14:16.846 --> 00:14:18.182
Popp: It worked...

00:14:18.216 --> 00:14:21.388
I remember General Flazzard
used that spell on us.

00:14:22.023 --> 00:14:23.326
Now that I'm stronger...

00:14:23.359 --> 00:14:26.165
I figured I might
be able to do it, too!

00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:27.166
Amazing.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.572
You fired three Kafrizz
spells at the same time.

00:14:29.606 --> 00:14:30.708
[chuckle]

00:14:30.741 --> 00:14:32.945
Well, I was actually
trying to cast five-

00:14:32.979 --> 00:14:35.050
But with the magic
power I had left...

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:37.855
I guess that's my limit.

00:14:37.889 --> 00:14:40.761
But it should still
be enough for him!

00:14:40.795 --> 00:14:42.965
[snarling]

00:14:42.998 --> 00:14:46.405
That's quite the fire-
it's not going to go out easily.

00:14:46.438 --> 00:14:47.207
Look at him.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.144
It might not do
very much damage,

00:14:49.177 --> 00:14:51.816
but it's making it hard
for him to get any oxygen-

00:14:51.849 --> 00:14:54.221
I think we've got
the upper hand!

00:14:54.254 --> 00:14:58.229
The pain...
I can't breathe!

00:14:58.262 --> 00:14:59.832
And now we've got an opening.

00:14:59.866 --> 00:15:01.168
With the fire
around his face,

00:15:01.201 --> 00:15:03.239
he'll have to open
the mouth on his stomach

00:15:03.272 --> 00:15:05.210
if he wants to get any air.

00:15:05.243 --> 00:15:06.144
Alright.

00:15:06.178 --> 00:15:07.948
We're coming for you Dai.

00:15:07.981 --> 00:15:10.085
Popp: This is our best chance.

00:15:11.255 --> 00:15:14.962
It burns! I can't take it!

00:15:19.839 --> 00:15:22.110
Now, Chiu!
You let him have it.

00:15:22.143 --> 00:15:24.180
Get him right in the stomach!

00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:27.053
Right. I've got this!

00:15:27.087 --> 00:15:30.092
Chiu [thought]: So I say-
but what attack should I use?

00:15:30.125 --> 00:15:32.363
Dai: Didn't Maam say you
could still hold your own

00:15:32.396 --> 00:15:34.735
with ramming and
headbutt attacks?

00:15:34.769 --> 00:15:35.904
Chiu [thought]: That's it!

00:15:35.938 --> 00:15:40.279
Who cares if I look cool
or not. I have to try.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.462
Take this!

00:16:05.564 --> 00:16:07.166
It's Dai!

00:16:08.135 --> 00:16:10.005
And he's still moving!

00:16:10.039 --> 00:16:12.711
Chiu: That attack was
actually pretty cool, right?

00:16:12.745 --> 00:16:16.586
A name... A move like
that deserves a great name!

00:16:18.022 --> 00:16:21.394
Ah! I'll call it the
"Rattus Rocket Ram"!

00:16:22.898 --> 00:16:24.536
You dummy!
Pay more attention.

00:16:24.569 --> 00:16:26.840
If you hit him just
a little bit harder-

00:16:26.873 --> 00:16:28.375
Dai would be out!

00:16:29.377 --> 00:16:31.315
Zamza: I've had it with you!

00:16:31.348 --> 00:16:36.626
You'll pay. You'll pay
for that, you filthy trash...

00:16:36.659 --> 00:16:38.663
I'll finish you!

00:16:40.099 --> 00:16:41.001
[coughing]

00:16:41.035 --> 00:16:42.203
Popp [thought]:
It didn't work.

00:16:46.211 --> 00:16:48.382
I... I can't move!

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:50.787
It ends here.

00:16:51.923 --> 00:16:53.091
What the-?!

00:16:56.799 --> 00:16:57.935
It can't be...

00:16:57.968 --> 00:17:00.807
How is she resisting
the gas? Impossible.

00:17:00.841 --> 00:17:02.744
It doesn't make any sense.

00:17:02.778 --> 00:17:04.480
Mr. Ghost: It's
her Magic Power.

00:17:06.085 --> 00:17:07.788
Mr. Ghost: Look closer.

00:17:07.821 --> 00:17:11.328
Do you not see that white
light surrounding her?

00:17:11.361 --> 00:17:14.301
That's the glow of
a healing Magic Power

00:17:14.334 --> 00:17:17.273
that she's spread
all over her body.

00:17:17.306 --> 00:17:20.012
I didn't know
that was possible.

00:17:20.046 --> 00:17:21.683
Maam [thought]:
This prison might be

00:17:21.716 --> 00:17:23.252
immune to all attacks...

00:17:23.285 --> 00:17:26.759
But it's still
a living creature.

00:17:29.331 --> 00:17:30.800
Maam [thought]:
Grand Master,

00:17:30.834 --> 00:17:35.276
I shall now use the Warrior
Master Style Secret Attack!

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.652
What the - what's
she trying to do?

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:49.137
I think she's gonna punch it?

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.609
Fobster [thought]: It's
useless! We've all tried.

00:17:52.443 --> 00:17:54.214
Gomez [thought]:
After everything we did,

00:17:54.247 --> 00:17:56.218
there isn't even a dent!

00:17:56.252 --> 00:17:58.756
Larba [thought]: What
can a girl like her do?

00:18:06.171 --> 00:18:07.774
[roaring]

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.099
There is no escaping it!

00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:23.807
I'll crush you both,
you worthless filth!

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.677
Enough!

00:18:28.683 --> 00:18:30.452
Miss Maam...

00:18:41.107 --> 00:18:42.878
What is that?!

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:55.269
Oh, no! M-My Bioprison...

00:19:04.387 --> 00:19:06.793
You think that
thing could hold me?

00:19:06.826 --> 00:19:07.828
M-Maam!

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:09.665
It's you!

00:19:10.634 --> 00:19:12.871
What do you think you're
doing, little girl?

00:19:14.875 --> 00:19:16.612
Something to say?

00:19:17.046 --> 00:19:18.783
[pained howl]

00:19:27.535 --> 00:19:28.670
Nice shot.

00:19:28.703 --> 00:19:30.105
Maam: Midheal.

00:19:30.139 --> 00:19:33.579
Wow! You really are
a Warrior Priest!

00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:37.053
Chiu, I need you
to go help Popp.

00:19:37.086 --> 00:19:39.290
What? Him of all people?

00:19:39.323 --> 00:19:41.896
That's right. Just while
I'm dealing with this guy.

00:19:44.869 --> 00:19:45.738
Now, hurry!

00:19:45.771 --> 00:19:46.806
Right!

00:19:47.206 --> 00:19:48.509
Is that it?

00:19:49.512 --> 00:19:53.753
I can heal... a wound
like this in no time.

00:19:56.959 --> 00:19:58.763
King Romos:
We must rescue them.

00:19:58.796 --> 00:19:59.965
That is an order!

00:19:59.998 --> 00:20:03.171
Go help the injured get
clear of the battlefield.

00:20:03.205 --> 00:20:04.207
And hurry!

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.544
Both: Sire!

00:20:05.577 --> 00:20:07.113
Why, you brat...

00:20:07.147 --> 00:20:09.284
You'll pay for this!

00:20:09.317 --> 00:20:10.887
I don't even need you...

00:20:10.921 --> 00:20:12.558
A terrible specimen!

00:20:12.591 --> 00:20:15.797
I'll dispose of you
right here and now!

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:17.768
You're finished!

00:20:17.801 --> 00:20:20.073
Of all the enemies
I've ever fought,

00:20:20.106 --> 00:20:22.110
you're by far the worst.

00:20:22.143 --> 00:20:24.448
To take the lives of humans...

00:20:24.481 --> 00:20:26.619
the lives of monsters...

00:20:26.652 --> 00:20:29.024
and just treat them like toys.

00:20:29.057 --> 00:20:31.862
That is unforgivable-
you hear me?!

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:34.067
Silence, you fool.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.372
It is a glorious study!

00:20:36.405 --> 00:20:39.210
A step forward for
all of Darkling kind.

00:20:39.244 --> 00:20:40.547
To create,

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:44.020
one must be willing to sacrifice
absolutely everything!

00:20:44.053 --> 00:20:46.391
Something that
you can't understand!

00:20:47.193 --> 00:20:48.996
I don't think
you can learn it.

00:20:49.999 --> 00:20:51.769
So, I'll have to show you.

00:20:52.671 --> 00:20:55.744
[snide laughter]

00:20:55.778 --> 00:20:57.179
Hilarious.

00:20:57.213 --> 00:21:00.253
What can a puny
creature like you...

00:21:00.286 --> 00:21:02.490
do to the likes of me?

00:21:02.525 --> 00:21:06.799
I, Zamza, stand at
the apex of all creation!

00:21:06.833 --> 00:21:08.703
My body is immortal!

00:21:08.737 --> 00:21:12.010
[laughing]

00:21:12.043 --> 00:21:13.044
W-What?!

00:21:14.748 --> 00:21:15.517
[shocked yell]

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:18.690
But, I... I'm
not regenerating?

00:21:18.723 --> 00:21:19.825
Impossible?!

00:21:19.858 --> 00:21:22.931
That's it!
Miss Maam's ultimate move!

00:21:22.964 --> 00:21:24.334
Wh-what is it?

00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:27.139
Only the greatest of
the Warrior Attacks.

00:21:27.173 --> 00:21:29.878
Chiu: She learned
it from our master.

00:21:29.912 --> 00:21:31.916
The Refractor Fist!

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:33.819
Popp: The Refractor Fist?

00:21:34.888 --> 00:21:36.592
[pained yell]

00:21:36.626 --> 00:21:41.969
Is this... the power you
used to breach my Bioprison?

00:21:42.002 --> 00:21:43.573
This can't be.

00:21:43.606 --> 00:21:47.012
I am a... a Superior Being!

00:21:51.055 --> 00:21:52.490
A Superior Being...

00:21:52.525 --> 00:21:56.097
Is meant to be invincible!

00:23:38.202 --> 00:23:39.705
Narrator: Maam's
Refractor Fist

00:23:39.738 --> 00:23:42.376
may have damaged the
Superior Being Zamza,

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:44.515
but it's not enough
to finish him off.

00:23:44.548 --> 00:23:46.952
Soon Dai realizes
the difference between

00:23:46.986 --> 00:23:49.357
his and Maam's techniques,
and pushes through

00:23:49.391 --> 00:23:52.329
his exhaustion to
rejoin the fight...

00:23:52.363 --> 00:23:53.800
But will his
crest's remaining power

00:23:53.833 --> 00:23:56.505
be enough to
stop their foe?

00:23:56.538 --> 00:23:58.242

00:23:58.275 --> 00:24:01.047
