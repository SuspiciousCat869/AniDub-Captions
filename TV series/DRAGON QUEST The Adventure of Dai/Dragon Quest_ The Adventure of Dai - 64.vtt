WEBVTT

00:01:55.832 --> 00:01:57.602
It looks brand new.

00:01:57.635 --> 00:01:59.873
There's not a
single scratch on it.

00:02:02.178 --> 00:02:03.413
I'm glad you're okay,

00:02:03.446 --> 00:02:06.988
because I need your help
more than ever, my friend.

00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:09.091
This could actually
be our final battle,

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:11.162
and I can't win
it without you.

00:02:11.195 --> 00:02:13.534
It's gonna take
everything we've got...

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:17.174
So I hope you're
ready for a long day.

00:02:17.207 --> 00:02:19.579
I can't thank you
enough, Lon Beruk.

00:02:20.882 --> 00:02:22.218
Congratulations, Dai.

00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:24.122
This is exactly
the boost you needed.

00:02:24.155 --> 00:02:25.992
And now that the
sword's even stronger,

00:02:26.025 --> 00:02:27.862
you won't have any
problem channeling

00:02:27.896 --> 00:02:29.432
your Draconic Aura, right?

00:02:29.465 --> 00:02:32.806
Well, the sword
doesn't get any stronger.

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:36.445
I do - but I still can't
focus my power without it.

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:38.551
Lon Beruk: You aren't
the only one who's improved.

00:02:38.584 --> 00:02:41.623
You see, I've done a
little tinkering as well.

00:02:41.657 --> 00:02:44.863
The sword remains a conduit
as it always has been.

00:02:44.897 --> 00:02:47.569
But in battle, you should
be able to unleash

00:02:47.602 --> 00:02:49.706
an even greater
power than before.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.579
The secret to this is
not the blade itself;

00:02:52.612 --> 00:02:54.248
but it's scabbard.

00:02:54.281 --> 00:02:56.921
Oh, really?

00:02:56.954 --> 00:03:00.094
That's right. I've written
all the details down here.

00:03:00.127 --> 00:03:02.899
Just read through
it before you head out.

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.078
It's okay. I've got
you covered, Dai.

00:03:09.111 --> 00:03:10.514
I've also made
some enhancements

00:03:10.548 --> 00:03:12.384
to the Dark Armor Spear...

00:03:12.417 --> 00:03:15.390
Am I to understand that
Hyunckel's been captured?

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:19.866
Lon Beruk: That's a pity...

00:03:20.868 --> 00:03:24.141
You've lost two of your
strongest warriors.

00:03:24.174 --> 00:03:26.413
Honestly, I'm amazed
that you've decided to

00:03:26.446 --> 00:03:28.249
go through with
infiltrating Vearn Palace

00:03:28.283 --> 00:03:30.487
despite these
circumstances.

00:03:30.522 --> 00:03:32.224
One might call it bravery,

00:03:32.257 --> 00:03:34.596
but I call it recklessness.

00:03:35.732 --> 00:03:38.637
Human nature just
baffles me sometimes.

00:03:38.671 --> 00:03:40.541
Nova [thought]:
Who is this guy?

00:03:40.575 --> 00:03:42.277
Well, at least
I've forged a weapon

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.281
for each of Dai's companions.

00:03:44.314 --> 00:03:46.587
Perhaps they'll give you
a chance at success.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.489
Wait, you made
something for each of us?

00:03:48.524 --> 00:03:51.730
That's right!
Get a load of these.

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:58.811
[surprised breaths]

00:03:59.813 --> 00:04:01.483
Baduck: This one's
the new Dark Armor Spear.

00:04:01.517 --> 00:04:04.523
There's an axe for Crocodine,
and this staff is for...

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:06.927
Hang on. What's
happened to Popp?

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.863
He's, uh...

00:04:07.896 --> 00:04:10.701
Yeah, I haven't seen
him for a while now.

00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:14.976
Apparently, he was
headed into the forest.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.016
Oh. I guess he's been doing
some serious training, too.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.420
So... Is this one for me?

00:04:20.453 --> 00:04:22.792
Yes, and it's some
of my finest work.

00:04:24.128 --> 00:04:25.831
Lon Beruk:
The Dark Armor Fist.

00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:28.302
Maam: It's beautiful.

00:04:28.336 --> 00:04:31.743
It's designed to be used
with your non-dominant hand.

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:33.814
Aw, man.

00:04:33.847 --> 00:04:36.352
Of course everybody here
gets a new weapon but me.

00:04:36.386 --> 00:04:38.558
Baduck: Cheer up.
There's one for you, too.

00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:39.559
What?!

00:04:39.593 --> 00:04:42.197
No way. The Lon Beruk
made a weapon for me?!

00:04:42.231 --> 00:04:44.468
Er... No, this
one's my invention.

00:04:45.004 --> 00:04:48.143
The Barbed Nunchaku!

00:04:48.176 --> 00:04:49.613
Baduck: There you go.

00:04:49.646 --> 00:04:50.514
Yikes...

00:04:50.548 --> 00:04:52.350
This little devil
will shred any foe!

00:04:52.384 --> 00:04:54.923
[chuckle]

00:04:54.956 --> 00:04:56.292
Yeah, and it looks like it'll

00:04:56.325 --> 00:04:59.165
shred my hands
while it's at it.

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:01.504
You know me so well.
I love it.

00:05:01.537 --> 00:05:02.805
Yowch!

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.346
[laughing]

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:07.648
Get a hold of yourself.

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:10.220
There's no need
to be so emotional.

00:05:10.253 --> 00:05:11.222
Lon Beruk...

00:05:11.255 --> 00:05:13.260
I mean no offense,
but I wonder...

00:05:13.293 --> 00:05:15.799
You're a Darkling-
so why help us humans?

00:05:15.832 --> 00:05:16.800
If you want the truth,

00:05:16.834 --> 00:05:19.839
I was never really on
the Dark King's side.

00:05:19.873 --> 00:05:22.812
I merely did what
he asked me to do...

00:05:22.846 --> 00:05:25.652
And I may have forged
the Staff of Edacity,

00:05:25.685 --> 00:05:27.555
but it wasn't my
craftsmanship that made it

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:29.258
the strongest
weapon in the world,

00:05:29.292 --> 00:05:31.763
it was King Vearn himself.

00:05:31.796 --> 00:05:33.499
With his power?

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:36.405
He could level a whole city
with nothing but a knife.

00:05:36.438 --> 00:05:40.548
Frankly, he was most boring
customer I've ever had...

00:05:40.581 --> 00:05:43.019
This a far more
interesting endeavor...

00:05:43.052 --> 00:05:46.458
Seeing the weak scrape
together what power they can.

00:05:46.492 --> 00:05:48.630
Does that answer
your question?

00:05:53.574 --> 00:05:55.845
Leona: Wow, that guy
is really prickly.

00:05:55.878 --> 00:05:56.780
[awkward laugh]

00:05:56.813 --> 00:05:57.816
Yeah, I know...

00:05:57.849 --> 00:05:59.953
But deep down, he's
really not such a bad guy.

00:05:59.986 --> 00:06:03.260
I say it's time we rescued
Crocodine and Hyunckel.

00:06:03.293 --> 00:06:05.297
With these,
we're sure to win!

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.700
Right, everyone?

00:06:07.735 --> 00:06:10.207
I'll take...
Crocodine's axe...

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.979
He'll be swinging
it before you know it.

00:06:13.012 --> 00:06:14.616
What is this thing made of?

00:06:16.052 --> 00:06:17.154
Ursa, up!

00:06:17.187 --> 00:06:18.957
[growl]

00:06:18.991 --> 00:06:20.862
Thanks, that's not
embarrassing at all.

00:06:20.895 --> 00:06:23.165
Then I'll take the
staff and spear...

00:06:24.401 --> 00:06:26.072
But, Amy...

00:06:26.105 --> 00:06:29.478
You take the staff,
but I'll carry the spear.

00:06:29.512 --> 00:06:32.451
Lady Amy: I want to
deliver it personally...

00:06:32.484 --> 00:06:34.454
to the man that I love.

00:06:37.127 --> 00:06:38.831
Well, duh.

00:06:38.864 --> 00:06:41.569
That's right.
I'm in love with Hyunckel.

00:06:43.573 --> 00:06:46.445
Lady Amy: At first,
I didn't want to believe it.

00:06:46.478 --> 00:06:47.582
How could I...

00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:49.218
love the Legion Commander

00:06:49.251 --> 00:06:51.690
responsible for
destroying our country?

00:06:51.724 --> 00:06:54.930
But then, slowly
I came to realize...

00:06:54.963 --> 00:06:58.403
that inside, he's really
pure and vulnerable.

00:06:58.436 --> 00:06:59.939
It's almost like his heart...

00:06:59.973 --> 00:07:03.547
is made of shattered glass;
it's sharp but delicate.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.250
No matter what
he may have been,

00:07:05.284 --> 00:07:06.620
I was still drawn to him.

00:07:06.653 --> 00:07:08.657
Before the last battle,
I took his spear,

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.864
and hid it away in a place
I knew he'd never look.

00:07:11.897 --> 00:07:14.736
I really didn't want
him to fight again...

00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:17.073
I couldn't bear the
thought of him being hurt.

00:07:18.544 --> 00:07:21.181
Maam [thought]:
I... I didn't know.

00:07:21.215 --> 00:07:24.188
Only... It was
a terrible mistake.

00:07:24.221 --> 00:07:25.658
It only drove him away,

00:07:25.691 --> 00:07:28.130
and I left him defenseless.

00:07:28.163 --> 00:07:29.365
But now I understand,

00:07:29.398 --> 00:07:31.469
and if he wants
to live in battle-

00:07:31.503 --> 00:07:34.643
if he wants to be punished
for all his mistakes...

00:07:34.676 --> 00:07:37.080
Well, then I embrace his fate.

00:07:37.114 --> 00:07:39.251
And I accept it as my own.

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:44.863
I have to make sure
he knows the truth.

00:07:44.896 --> 00:07:47.134
You wouldn't mind,
would you Maam?

00:07:47.168 --> 00:07:49.038
What? Uh, s-sure...

00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:53.045
I - I guess I'll go find
Popp and give this to him.

00:07:54.448 --> 00:07:55.551
M-Maam...

00:07:56.853 --> 00:07:59.057
Don't you worry, Amy.
We've got your back.

00:07:59.091 --> 00:08:01.328
You'll be seeing Hyunckel
again, very soon.

00:08:01.361 --> 00:08:02.397
And when you do,

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.602
make sure you
tell him how you feel.

00:08:04.636 --> 00:08:06.506
Oh, I already did...

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.942
Sadly, he turned me down.

00:08:07.975 --> 00:08:09.211
Wow, what a moron.

00:08:09.245 --> 00:08:11.082
He must be under
a Muddle spell.

00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:12.519
So, what d'you think?

00:08:12.552 --> 00:08:14.856
Well, it's
exciting, isn't it?

00:08:16.627 --> 00:08:18.363
That's not what I meant.

00:08:18.396 --> 00:08:19.498
You know what they say,

00:08:19.533 --> 00:08:21.368
the heart wants
what it wants...

00:08:21.402 --> 00:08:23.172
And also, Maam
clearly has no idea

00:08:23.205 --> 00:08:25.945
what she's working with -
this might inspire her.

00:08:25.978 --> 00:08:27.616
This could be a
great opportunity

00:08:27.649 --> 00:08:29.553
for her to grow as a person.

00:08:29.586 --> 00:08:32.691
Your expression is saying
something very different.

00:08:34.028 --> 00:08:34.929
Oh?

00:08:38.537 --> 00:08:40.073
Is, uh, something going on?

00:08:40.107 --> 00:08:41.977
Ah, it's nothing!
Just battle plans...

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:43.714
Dai [thought]:
If Merle gets involved,

00:08:43.747 --> 00:08:46.720
we're never going to
make it to Vearn Palace.

00:08:46.753 --> 00:08:48.490
Okay... Well,
the food is ready

00:08:48.524 --> 00:08:50.727
for everyone now,
Queen Flora.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:53.801
Flora: Good. Once we've
eaten, let's all check

00:08:53.834 --> 00:08:55.971
our weapons one last time...

00:08:56.005 --> 00:08:59.178
and then try to get as
much rest as possible.

00:08:59.211 --> 00:09:02.752
For tomorrow, we go to war!

00:09:03.486 --> 00:09:05.624
All: Yeah!

00:09:16.112 --> 00:09:17.648
How could I miss that?

00:09:17.681 --> 00:09:20.788
I had no idea Amy felt
that way about Hyunckel...

00:09:20.822 --> 00:09:25.731
I kinda feel sick. No -
I'm not jealous, am I?

00:09:28.971 --> 00:09:30.941
Popp [thought]: According
to the Ancient Tome,

00:09:30.975 --> 00:09:32.812
there are five types
of soul power

00:09:32.845 --> 00:09:35.216
required for
the Kaglimmer spell.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:38.891
There's Courage, Love,
Fortitude, Justice...

00:09:38.924 --> 00:09:42.164
and a fifth one which
is too faded to make out.

00:09:42.197 --> 00:09:43.165
Well, great.

00:09:43.199 --> 00:09:45.671
How much you wanna bet
that one's yours, Popp?

00:09:45.704 --> 00:09:48.075
Dai is obviously Courage...

00:09:48.108 --> 00:09:49.411
Maam is Love...

00:09:49.444 --> 00:09:50.981
Leona's Justice...

00:09:51.014 --> 00:09:53.019
I wouldn't be surprised
if "Hyunckel" means

00:09:53.052 --> 00:09:55.591
fortitude in some
language I can't speak.

00:09:55.625 --> 00:09:58.096
So... Mine is
the mystery word...

00:09:58.129 --> 00:10:00.233
And I'm pretty sure
it's not "clueless"...

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:03.005
but, what else do I deserve?

00:10:03.039 --> 00:10:06.713
I mean, I only got this far
by the skin of my teeth.

00:10:06.746 --> 00:10:09.418
And really, the only
reason I even tried was

00:10:09.451 --> 00:10:10.554
because I wanted to impress...

00:10:10.587 --> 00:10:12.056
Maam: Hey, Popp.

00:10:14.295 --> 00:10:15.396
Oh, Maam.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.123
Oh, Maam.

00:10:28.156 --> 00:10:31.328
I'm sorry if I
interrupted your training.

00:10:31.362 --> 00:10:33.099
No, I was finished.

00:10:33.132 --> 00:10:35.871
Popp [thought]: I want to
tell her, but... I can't.

00:10:35.905 --> 00:10:38.678
She can't find out that
I'm not like the others.

00:10:38.711 --> 00:10:41.215
That I'm... mediocre.

00:10:41.248 --> 00:10:44.121
Maam: Here. Lon Beruk
made you this staff.

00:10:44.154 --> 00:10:46.125
There's a set of
instructions, too.

00:10:46.159 --> 00:10:47.562
Lon Beruk turned up?

00:10:47.595 --> 00:10:49.533
Yeah. He found Dai
and Hyunckel's weapons

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:50.500
and did some repairs...

00:10:50.534 --> 00:10:52.003
He even made a few new ones

00:10:52.037 --> 00:10:54.509
for the rest of us to
take into battle, too.

00:10:54.542 --> 00:10:56.713
Wow. Pretty
thoughtful for him.

00:10:56.746 --> 00:10:59.752
With the Sword of Dai, we
might even stand a chance.

00:11:00.821 --> 00:11:04.294
All right. Let's see what
kind of weapon this is.

00:11:04.328 --> 00:11:06.132
Hey, uh... Listen, Popp...

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:07.133
Popp: Mhmm.

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:09.271
Can I talk to you about
something that, uh...

00:11:09.305 --> 00:11:10.273
It's kinda awkward.

00:11:10.306 --> 00:11:12.711
Yeah, sure. What's up?

00:11:12.745 --> 00:11:17.220
Well... It's, um, it's
sort of about Hyunckel.

00:11:17.253 --> 00:11:19.526
Maam: I don't really
know how to say this,

00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:22.096
but I think I've
got feelings for him.

00:11:22.766 --> 00:11:24.168
I know I told you...

00:11:24.201 --> 00:11:27.775
that I didn't know what to think
about him as a man before...

00:11:27.808 --> 00:11:30.346
But, something's different.

00:11:30.379 --> 00:11:31.482
Like, I've...

00:11:31.516 --> 00:11:34.321
never really felt this
way about any man in my life.

00:11:34.355 --> 00:11:36.058
I tried to brush it off...

00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:37.728
But Amy just told everybody

00:11:37.761 --> 00:11:39.197
that she's in love
with Hyunckel,

00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:42.872
and when she did, I got
this weird sinking feeling.

00:11:42.906 --> 00:11:45.578
So does that mean
I'm jealous of her?

00:11:45.611 --> 00:11:47.213
Or am I just confused because

00:11:47.247 --> 00:11:49.719
someone other than
us understands him?

00:11:49.752 --> 00:11:51.455
I - I don't know.

00:11:52.692 --> 00:11:53.727
M-Maybe I really do...

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.029
Popp: Shut up.

00:11:56.432 --> 00:11:57.735
I can't believe you.

00:11:57.769 --> 00:11:59.137
How am I supposed to know

00:11:59.171 --> 00:12:00.674
what you don't
even know yourself?

00:12:00.708 --> 00:12:02.579
Figure it out, Maam!

00:12:02.612 --> 00:12:04.481
Whoa, what is your problem?

00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:07.487
Popp: The biggest battle
of our lives is tomorrow.

00:12:07.521 --> 00:12:08.857
We might not be coming back...

00:12:08.891 --> 00:12:11.730
and you're freaking out
about your stupid feelings?!

00:12:11.763 --> 00:12:13.066
Well, whatever.

00:12:13.099 --> 00:12:16.973
I do not care if you're in
love with Hyunckel or not.

00:12:23.654 --> 00:12:25.691
I - I'm sorry, Popp.

00:12:25.724 --> 00:12:26.993
Tomorrow is a big day,

00:12:27.026 --> 00:12:29.364
and I didn't realize
how hard you were training.

00:12:29.398 --> 00:12:31.334
I just needed a friend...

00:12:31.368 --> 00:12:34.442
And you're the only one I
can talk to about this stuff-

00:12:34.475 --> 00:12:36.546
or, I thought you were.

00:12:36.579 --> 00:12:38.148
I was wrong.

00:12:47.234 --> 00:12:50.140
Popp [thought]:
No, Maam. I'm wrong.

00:12:50.173 --> 00:12:53.178
She came to me
because she trusts me,

00:12:53.212 --> 00:12:56.686
and I threw it in her face -
because of my feelings.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.523
I can't even be
honest with her.

00:12:58.556 --> 00:13:02.531
No wonder this dumb little
rock won't shine for me.

00:13:02.564 --> 00:13:04.401
I'm... hopeless.

00:13:04.434 --> 00:13:06.539
I can't stand it!

00:13:20.433 --> 00:13:22.103
What just happened...

00:13:23.339 --> 00:13:24.642
How did I do that?

00:13:24.676 --> 00:13:26.345
"The Black Rod, for Popp.

00:13:26.378 --> 00:13:27.614
This absorbs Magic Power

00:13:27.648 --> 00:13:30.053
and converts it into
physical energy.

00:13:30.086 --> 00:13:32.224
It can also extend
and change shape

00:13:32.257 --> 00:13:34.529
according to
the user's will."

00:13:34.563 --> 00:13:35.363
Huh.

00:13:45.817 --> 00:13:48.189
Wow, this thing is incredible!

00:13:48.222 --> 00:13:51.596
It's kinda similar to
Vearn's Staff of Edacity.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.867
And it changes shape, too?

00:13:53.901 --> 00:13:55.704
I must have
accidentally imbued it

00:13:55.738 --> 00:13:57.741
with Magic Power
in that moment.

00:13:57.775 --> 00:14:00.347
And if it's able turn
that little of the stuff

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.050
into a blast that size?

00:14:02.083 --> 00:14:05.991
This'll deal some serious
damage if I push myself.

00:14:06.024 --> 00:14:07.728
Popp [thought]:
It's the only way now.

00:14:07.761 --> 00:14:08.830
All or nothing.

00:14:08.863 --> 00:14:10.534
Everything I tried
wouldn't make

00:14:10.567 --> 00:14:12.738
my Insignia
of Avan glow.

00:14:12.771 --> 00:14:14.642
So, I'll just have to
figure something out

00:14:14.675 --> 00:14:16.946
on the spot and
hope for the best.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.385
Everyone is counting on
me to pull my weight.

00:14:19.418 --> 00:14:22.056
I can put it all together
at the last minute.

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:26.264
It's like Matoriv said:
I have to believe in myself.

00:14:28.903 --> 00:14:30.140
Chiu: That's right,
my friends.

00:14:30.173 --> 00:14:32.277
We ride into battle at dawn.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:34.014
It's what we've
been training for,

00:14:34.047 --> 00:14:35.917
so I hope you'll
give it your all!

00:14:35.951 --> 00:14:37.320
[cheering]

00:14:38.022 --> 00:14:39.291
With that said...

00:14:39.324 --> 00:14:40.994
Some soldiers have
brought to my attention

00:14:41.028 --> 00:14:44.334
that we monsters might be a
little tricky to distinguish

00:14:44.367 --> 00:14:48.108
from our enemies in
the heat of battle, so...

00:14:48.142 --> 00:14:49.946
All of the Beast
King Commandos

00:14:49.979 --> 00:14:51.783
are going to wear
these badges!

00:14:51.816 --> 00:14:54.354
Now, I've assigned a
number for each of you.

00:15:01.135 --> 00:15:02.872
There - and Otoad makes ten!

00:15:02.905 --> 00:15:05.376
Huh? Wait... Hang on.

00:15:05.409 --> 00:15:06.580
Something's fishy.

00:15:06.613 --> 00:15:07.982
Why are there eleven of you?

00:15:08.015 --> 00:15:08.917
Brokeena: Boo!

00:15:11.789 --> 00:15:12.791
Chiu: M-Master?!

00:15:12.824 --> 00:15:14.996
Master Brokeena,
why are you here?

00:15:15.029 --> 00:15:17.535
Brokeena: Brokeena?
I've never heard of him.

00:15:17.568 --> 00:15:18.570
No, sir.

00:15:18.603 --> 00:15:21.308
I am the Beast King
Commandos eleventh helper.

00:15:21.341 --> 00:15:24.816
The creature of
mystery... Mr. Beast!

00:15:24.849 --> 00:15:25.984
Uh-huh.

00:15:26.017 --> 00:15:28.489
You know you're not
fooling anybody, right?

00:15:28.524 --> 00:15:30.628
Brokeena: But helping
my students in secret

00:15:30.661 --> 00:15:32.698
makes me so much cooler.

00:15:32.731 --> 00:15:36.304
Now can we see about
getting me a badge, please?

00:15:36.338 --> 00:15:38.743
I'd like to fit
in with the others.

00:15:38.777 --> 00:15:40.212
Master...

00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:43.887
Akhim: The execution is meant
to take place in Loroi Valley.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.991
Part of the Dark Army
is already there.

00:15:46.024 --> 00:15:48.329
We have mountain
cover on every side...

00:15:48.362 --> 00:15:50.901
If we're surrounded,
there won't be any escape.

00:15:50.935 --> 00:15:52.805
The terrain is
certainly an issue,

00:15:52.838 --> 00:15:54.274
but our biggest
problem will come

00:15:54.307 --> 00:15:56.846
when it's time to cast
the Kaglimmer spell.

00:15:56.879 --> 00:15:58.048
In that time,

00:15:58.082 --> 00:16:00.588
the Disciples of Avan
won't be able to fight.

00:16:00.621 --> 00:16:03.058
Our remaining forces will
have to fend off the enemy

00:16:03.092 --> 00:16:04.529
with everything we've got.

00:16:04.562 --> 00:16:07.033
You can leave that part
of the puzzle to me.

00:16:07.067 --> 00:16:08.870
I'm sure we can
rally the soldiers.

00:16:08.903 --> 00:16:10.674
Lon Beruk: Is such
a patchwork army

00:16:10.708 --> 00:16:12.176
going to be enough?

00:16:15.751 --> 00:16:17.420
Oh, yeah? What do you care?

00:16:17.453 --> 00:16:18.356
I'm just wondering

00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:20.727
how you're planning
to hold your ground.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.897
Seems important.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:23.232
If Vearn breaches your line

00:16:23.265 --> 00:16:26.606
before the Disciples are
finished, well, you're all dead.

00:16:27.742 --> 00:16:29.344
Do you want a new scar?

00:16:29.377 --> 00:16:31.850
You know, some of us
aren't here on a whim

00:16:31.883 --> 00:16:33.419
like you are, you old goat.

00:16:33.452 --> 00:16:35.824
I'm willing to risk
everything for this.

00:16:35.857 --> 00:16:39.264
Risking your life doesn't
guarantee that you'll win.

00:16:39.297 --> 00:16:40.800
You could die in vain.

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:41.670
Oh, yeah?

00:16:41.703 --> 00:16:43.038
Calm down, Nova. He's right.

00:16:43.071 --> 00:16:44.575
Lon Beruk: Yeah,
take it easy, kid.

00:16:44.609 --> 00:16:47.714
I'm not saying all of
this just to insult you.

00:16:48.617 --> 00:16:49.552
As a matter of fact,

00:16:49.585 --> 00:16:52.725
I'm trying to offer
you a helping hand.

00:16:52.759 --> 00:16:53.994
A helping hand, huh?

00:16:54.027 --> 00:16:55.864
You would join in
this battle yourself?

00:16:55.897 --> 00:16:57.601
Lon Beruk: Yes.
I thought it might be

00:16:57.634 --> 00:17:00.640
interesting to follow
you all to the end.

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:15.002
Oh - hello, Dai.

00:17:15.036 --> 00:17:16.304
What are you doing?

00:17:16.338 --> 00:17:19.044
I'm preparing medicinal
herbs for the soldiers.

00:17:19.077 --> 00:17:21.348
What about you?
Trouble sleeping?

00:17:21.381 --> 00:17:23.252
Yeah, I was getting
bored of lying down

00:17:23.286 --> 00:17:24.822
with my eyes closed.

00:17:24.855 --> 00:17:25.924
Nerves, right?

00:17:25.957 --> 00:17:29.031
I know I should,
but I can't relax.

00:17:29.064 --> 00:17:32.003
I have just the thing.
Give this a try.

00:17:32.037 --> 00:17:33.372
It's called a Dream Seed.

00:17:33.405 --> 00:17:36.178
Like the name implies,
it's great for healing fatigue.

00:17:36.211 --> 00:17:37.581
It will help you rest.

00:17:37.615 --> 00:17:38.449
Huh.

00:17:38.482 --> 00:17:40.520
And... They say
it's able to grant those

00:17:40.554 --> 00:17:42.824
who are pure of heart
a vivid dream which will

00:17:42.858 --> 00:17:46.632
fulfill whatever they wish
for the most when they take it.

00:17:46.666 --> 00:17:48.570
I'm sure you'll have
a wonderful dream

00:17:48.603 --> 00:17:50.472
and wake up refreshed.

00:17:52.344 --> 00:17:55.115
Thanks for the help,
Merle. Goodnight.

00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:57.353
Of course. Goodnight, Dai.

00:18:00.059 --> 00:18:01.996
Merle [thought]: May
the gods bless you with

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:04.602
a peaceful slumber and
restore your strength.

00:18:04.636 --> 00:18:06.706
Because tomorrow,
you and your friends

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:10.847
will face a battle far
beyond my imagination.

00:19:20.352 --> 00:19:23.693
Dai [thought]: Don't be
sad, Mom. It's okay.

00:19:23.727 --> 00:19:27.901
This is my choice.
I'm going to fight.

00:19:27.934 --> 00:19:30.840
I know it's going to take
everything that I've got...

00:19:34.014 --> 00:19:37.386
But I promise I won't lose.

00:19:53.787 --> 00:19:54.788
Leona: There you are.

00:19:55.389 --> 00:19:56.960
Well, you look chipper.

00:19:56.993 --> 00:19:58.495
Something good happen?

00:19:58.529 --> 00:20:00.701
Yeah, I saw my mom in a dream.

00:20:00.734 --> 00:20:02.270
Leona: Your mother? Wow.

00:20:02.303 --> 00:20:04.775
I know. She was so beautiful.

00:20:04.809 --> 00:20:06.679
I wanted to thank
Merle for giving me

00:20:06.712 --> 00:20:09.484
a Dream Seed,
but I can't find her.

00:20:09.518 --> 00:20:12.290
You didn't know? She left
earlier with the others.

00:20:12.323 --> 00:20:13.860
She's going to fight, as well.

00:20:13.894 --> 00:20:15.162
Even Merle's coming?

00:20:15.196 --> 00:20:17.100
I tried to argue,
but she wouldn't hear it.

00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:20.507
She told me that if the fate
of the world is in the balance,

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.443
she'd rather be
fighting alongside us,

00:20:22.477 --> 00:20:25.182
even if she isn't
as strong as we are.

00:20:25.215 --> 00:20:28.255
I see. So where
are Popp and Maam?

00:20:28.288 --> 00:20:30.894
That is a very good question.

00:20:33.667 --> 00:20:35.035
[knocking]

00:20:35.069 --> 00:20:37.140
Popp: Maam, you in there?

00:20:37.173 --> 00:20:38.408
What is it?

00:20:38.441 --> 00:20:40.112
Popp: I just came
to apologize.

00:20:40.145 --> 00:20:41.849
I shouldn't have
yelled at you yesterday.

00:20:41.883 --> 00:20:43.118
I lost my temper...

00:20:43.152 --> 00:20:45.557
I do care about
your feelings, okay?

00:20:45.591 --> 00:20:46.593
I'm sorry.

00:20:46.626 --> 00:20:49.832
Oh, don't worry about it.
It was all my fault.

00:20:49.865 --> 00:20:52.037
Popp: Why don't we
just forget it happened,

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:53.906
and focus on today instead?

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.345
I mean, you can't
tell Hyunckel how you feel

00:20:56.378 --> 00:20:59.283
if you don't rescue
him first... Right?

00:21:00.654 --> 00:21:01.689
Maam: Right.

00:21:02.791 --> 00:21:03.960
Popp [thought]: And if
you're praying for Hyunckel,

00:21:03.994 --> 00:21:06.599
do me a favor and send
one up for me too, Maam.

00:21:06.632 --> 00:21:09.906
Pray that I don't screw up
when we all cast that spell.

00:21:09.939 --> 00:21:11.040
Huh? Aww...

00:21:12.911 --> 00:21:14.648
I thought there'd be drama.

00:21:14.681 --> 00:21:16.919
You're disappointed
there isn't?

00:21:16.953 --> 00:21:18.255
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:21:18.288 --> 00:21:19.558
It's finally time.

00:21:25.302 --> 00:21:27.440
I know you all
already know this,

00:21:27.473 --> 00:21:29.177
but I'm going
to say it anyway.

00:21:29.211 --> 00:21:30.547
Failure is not an option.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.651
The whole world's
counting on us.

00:21:32.684 --> 00:21:34.621
If we assume
for even a moment

00:21:34.655 --> 00:21:36.626
that we'll get a
second shot at this,

00:21:36.659 --> 00:21:38.563
then it is not going to work.

00:21:39.532 --> 00:21:42.003
This is going to be
our final battle.

00:21:42.036 --> 00:21:43.205
Understood?

00:21:43.238 --> 00:21:45.611
Now... Let's move
out, everyone.

00:21:45.644 --> 00:21:46.679
Yeah!

00:21:46.712 --> 00:21:47.747
Right.

00:23:37.835 --> 00:23:39.805
Narrator: In Loroi Valley,
the stage is set

00:23:39.838 --> 00:23:42.578
for Hyunckel and Crocodine
to meet their demise,

00:23:42.611 --> 00:23:45.684
and Vearn Palace looms
in the sky above...

00:23:45.717 --> 00:23:48.455
But Mystvearn approaches
his former protégé

00:23:48.489 --> 00:23:50.560
and unleashes his
Dark Aura in an attempt to

00:23:50.594 --> 00:23:53.232
use Hyunckel for
his evil ambitions.

00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:55.336
Will Dai and the
others be able to rescue

00:23:55.369 --> 00:23:56.906
their friends
before it's too late?

00:23:56.939 --> 00:23:58.643
