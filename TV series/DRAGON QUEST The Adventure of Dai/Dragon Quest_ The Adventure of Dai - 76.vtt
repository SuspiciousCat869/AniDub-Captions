WEBVTT

00:01:50.354 --> 00:01:53.227
Dark portal, sealed
off since ancient times...

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.531
I command you to open!

00:02:10.227 --> 00:02:11.697
I don't believe it...

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:12.464
[astonished chuckle]

00:02:12.497 --> 00:02:14.201
Get a load of this, you guys!

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:16.540
The gate just opened
like it's welcoming us.

00:02:16.573 --> 00:02:19.345
You were right, Master.
That spell came in handy.

00:02:19.378 --> 00:02:23.120
Now, then... Everybody?
Let's get a move on.

00:02:23.153 --> 00:02:24.355
Both: Okay!

00:02:25.357 --> 00:02:27.795
What is it, Dai?
You all right?

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.769
Well, master...
I'm grateful.

00:02:30.802 --> 00:02:31.937
Right now...

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.876
I want you to know that from
the bottom of my heart...

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.314
I'm happy you came
back to help us.

00:02:37.347 --> 00:02:39.485
We couldn't do
this without you.

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.358
Dai: I tried to get through
a gate like this with my dad,

00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:45.297
and we barely had enough
strength to breach it together.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.034
Now that I'm the
only Dragon Knight...

00:02:47.068 --> 00:02:48.469
Honestly?

00:02:48.504 --> 00:02:51.109
I was wracking my brain on how
we could get through this one.

00:02:51.142 --> 00:02:52.478
And... then you showed us that

00:02:52.512 --> 00:02:54.616
there was another
way to get it open...

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:57.287
Something even stronger
than brute strength.

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:59.158
That's right.

00:02:59.191 --> 00:03:02.265
Anyway, if you ask me,
there's no doubt about it.

00:03:02.298 --> 00:03:04.636
King Vearn thinks
that might makes right,

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:07.441
but he's wrong.
Power isn't everything.

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.080
The only reason I know that...

00:03:10.114 --> 00:03:12.251
Is because you keep
proving him wrong.

00:03:12.285 --> 00:03:14.122
Now you understand.

00:03:14.155 --> 00:03:16.527
Having no power at
all can be a problem,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.733
however, there's more
than just one kind.

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:20.802
Knowledge, perseverance,

00:03:20.835 --> 00:03:23.340
and a good heart are
all forms of power as well.

00:03:23.373 --> 00:03:24.609
Now... Come along.

00:03:24.642 --> 00:03:28.784
Our true battle still lies
ahead. No time to waste.

00:03:28.817 --> 00:03:30.253
Dai: Yes, sir!

00:03:45.585 --> 00:03:48.457
No! They're all
getting inside.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.797
Let's squash this
puny bug and get 'em.

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:54.301
Not a chance.

00:03:54.335 --> 00:03:56.439
Hyunckel: Now that the real
father figures returned,

00:03:56.472 --> 00:03:58.544
I can stop playing
the older brother.

00:03:58.578 --> 00:04:01.348
Instead, I can be
the warrior again...

00:04:01.382 --> 00:04:03.452
And none of you
will go after them.

00:04:03.486 --> 00:04:06.994
Sounds more like you're playing
the babbling idiot to me.

00:04:07.027 --> 00:04:09.398
It's curtain call, boys!

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:11.369
Hyunckel: Don't you get it?

00:04:11.402 --> 00:04:13.608
With Avan looking
after the others,

00:04:13.641 --> 00:04:15.812
I'm free to cut
loose and take you on

00:04:15.845 --> 00:04:18.684
without worrying
about the consequences.

00:04:20.354 --> 00:04:22.057
Give me all you've got.

00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:24.328
I have plenty
of energy to spare.

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:26.266
Again?

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:28.270
That's his second one today.

00:04:28.303 --> 00:04:29.672
Grand Cross!

00:04:40.561 --> 00:04:41.764
Monster: Impossible...

00:04:41.797 --> 00:04:44.434
Bring it on. I'll show
you what's possible.

00:04:46.873 --> 00:04:48.176
Maam: Oh, wow...

00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:49.378
Leona: No kidding.

00:04:49.411 --> 00:04:50.313
It's beautiful.

00:04:50.347 --> 00:04:51.483
I thought the
king of darkness

00:04:51.517 --> 00:04:53.821
would have a way
gloomier castle than this.

00:04:53.854 --> 00:04:56.726
You know, all dungeons
and cobwebs and whatnot...

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.867
this place is even classier
than King Bengarna's palace.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.937
Popp: It's more
luxurious than any palace.

00:05:01.971 --> 00:05:05.076
Avan: Perhaps, but it
serves an ugly purpose.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.613
Avan: There are
only two reasons

00:05:06.647 --> 00:05:09.318
to design a palace in
such a linear fashion.

00:05:09.352 --> 00:05:11.791
The first is to display
its beauty in a way that

00:05:11.824 --> 00:05:14.395
captures the attention
of any visitor...

00:05:14.428 --> 00:05:16.332
The second is tactical.

00:05:16.366 --> 00:05:18.403
If anyone tries to
invade such a stronghold,

00:05:18.436 --> 00:05:20.508
their forces will be forced
into a single column

00:05:20.542 --> 00:05:22.678
that can be ambushed
from either side.

00:05:27.855 --> 00:05:30.895
Maam: It just keeps getting
more breathtaking...

00:05:30.928 --> 00:05:33.499
Leona: But it looks
like Master Avan is right.

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:37.174
It's just one long pathway.
Be ready for that ambush.

00:05:37.208 --> 00:05:38.209
Best to keep moving.

00:05:38.242 --> 00:05:40.213
Hyunckel will
stop any pursuers.

00:05:40.246 --> 00:05:42.117
Our issue is what lies ahead.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.621
We'll have to keep
our eyes peeled.

00:05:43.654 --> 00:05:45.824
Enemies will be expecting us.

00:05:47.962 --> 00:05:48.864
Time out, gang.

00:05:48.897 --> 00:05:49.833
What's the matter?

00:05:49.866 --> 00:05:51.836
I just feel like
I'm ready to drop.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.640
Let me catch my
breath for a second.

00:05:53.674 --> 00:05:55.410
I can't keep up with you.

00:05:56.179 --> 00:05:57.882
I'm already out
of Magic Power,

00:05:57.915 --> 00:06:00.387
and this marathon is
sucking up my stamina

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.257
before I can really recover.

00:06:02.291 --> 00:06:03.594
Dai: Come to think of it,

00:06:03.627 --> 00:06:05.698
Popp's been out
of steam for a while.

00:06:05.731 --> 00:06:08.670
We all have. I mean,
aren't you exhausted too?

00:06:08.704 --> 00:06:10.007
Nah, I feel pretty great.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.879
Running all this way gave
a real boost to my energy.

00:06:12.912 --> 00:06:14.148
Leona [thought]: Yeah...

00:06:14.182 --> 00:06:16.485
I'm pretty sure it's supposed
to work the other way around.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.189
Popp: Please, I need
a Healing Spell.

00:06:18.222 --> 00:06:20.059
Don't let me
suffer like this...

00:06:21.963 --> 00:06:25.638
I'm begging you, a small one.
I can't take it anymore.

00:06:25.672 --> 00:06:27.341
Well since you
put it that way,

00:06:27.374 --> 00:06:29.278
how about I end your
suffering with this?

00:06:29.312 --> 00:06:31.081
Maybe we could
do with a break.

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:33.286
We can't fight on empty.

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:35.858
Okay! That settles it.

00:06:35.891 --> 00:06:38.630
I believe that a
snack break is in order.

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:41.637
Popp: In the middle
of the enemy's castle?

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.105
Uh-huh!

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:49.553
King Maximum: Sire,
there was word that

00:06:49.586 --> 00:06:52.090
my services may be required?

00:06:52.123 --> 00:06:54.061
Vearn: Maximum.

00:06:54.094 --> 00:06:56.032
King Maximum: Mystvearn
and the others have proven

00:06:56.065 --> 00:06:58.771
that things cannot
be left in their hands.

00:06:58.804 --> 00:07:01.475
Perhaps it is time you
called upon Vearn Palace's

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.183
most formidable guardian
to handle these vermin.

00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:06.921
Do as you please.

00:07:06.954 --> 00:07:08.890
King Maximum: Very well.

00:07:17.374 --> 00:07:19.479
Avan: Take heart,
my weary travelers...

00:07:19.513 --> 00:07:22.484
We shall slay this
vicious beast of hunger.

00:07:22.518 --> 00:07:26.326
My incredible picnic
set will save the day...

00:07:26.359 --> 00:07:29.398
Who brings a picnic
basket to a battle?

00:07:29.432 --> 00:07:31.670
Honestly, Master.
What is going on with you?

00:07:31.703 --> 00:07:33.206
Popp: Like, sure,
I could eat...

00:07:33.239 --> 00:07:34.709
But is this really
the right time

00:07:34.742 --> 00:07:36.412
to be sitting down for a meal?

00:07:36.446 --> 00:07:38.083
You know, Hyunckel's
still out there,

00:07:38.116 --> 00:07:39.686
all alone, fighting for us.

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:41.088
I may be in bad shape,

00:07:41.122 --> 00:07:44.061
but I'm not about to rest
while I know that's going on.

00:07:44.094 --> 00:07:44.929
Let's move!

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:48.469
Popp! What the...

00:07:48.503 --> 00:07:50.808
M-Master, what did
you do to him?

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:55.551
Weird...

00:07:55.584 --> 00:07:56.687
Whatever that was,

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.224
it completely restored
my Magic Power.

00:08:00.493 --> 00:08:01.830
Well, of course.

00:08:01.863 --> 00:08:04.769
That feather is not the same
as the one I used before.

00:08:04.802 --> 00:08:06.039
Avan: I designed them myself.

00:08:06.072 --> 00:08:08.342
The Gold Feathers
are used for combat...

00:08:08.376 --> 00:08:10.514
These items contain
Shining Stone,

00:08:10.548 --> 00:08:12.318
one of the elements
of Mysticite.

00:08:12.351 --> 00:08:13.654
When they're used in battle,

00:08:13.687 --> 00:08:16.325
they're able to amplify
the impact of magical attacks.

00:08:16.358 --> 00:08:17.762
Whereas, the
Silver Feathers -

00:08:17.795 --> 00:08:20.868
like the one I just used on Popp
- are designed for healing.

00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:23.406
The gems inside of these
are made from Holy Stone,

00:08:23.439 --> 00:08:25.645
which is able to
store Magic Power.

00:08:25.678 --> 00:08:27.782
This allows the user
to replenish themselves

00:08:27.815 --> 00:08:29.084
when they're low on energy.

00:08:29.118 --> 00:08:32.559
The Magic Bullet Gun I gave
Maam uses the same gem.

00:08:32.592 --> 00:08:34.529
Really? I had no idea.

00:08:34.562 --> 00:08:35.732
Then, doesn't that mean that

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:37.568
a stone possessing
both properties is...

00:08:37.601 --> 00:08:40.140
Indeed. Inside
your Insignias...

00:08:40.173 --> 00:08:42.645
Is a hybrid of both materials.

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:45.450
Avan: But even after the
Mysticite has been created,

00:08:45.484 --> 00:08:47.420
it takes time for
the alchemy to develop...

00:08:47.454 --> 00:08:50.459
So I was only able to create
these two types of Feathers

00:08:50.493 --> 00:08:52.464
while I was in
the Cave of Trials.

00:08:52.497 --> 00:08:54.669
You should be as
good as new, Popp.

00:08:55.605 --> 00:08:57.207
Curious...

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.209
Well, well.

00:08:58.243 --> 00:08:59.780
I must say I'm
quite impressed.

00:08:59.813 --> 00:09:01.883
Your abilities have
grown considerably.

00:09:01.917 --> 00:09:02.552
Huh?

00:09:02.585 --> 00:09:04.287
Yes, it's truly remarkable.

00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:06.626
You see, this Feather
contained enough Magic Power

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.398
to revive up to three Mages
of average strength...

00:09:09.431 --> 00:09:12.003
and you've emptied
the entire thing.

00:09:12.036 --> 00:09:15.009
Popp [thought]: No way...
When did I get that strong?

00:09:15.043 --> 00:09:17.081
I've never seen
anything like this.

00:09:17.114 --> 00:09:19.151
With such strength,
you might need some more.

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:21.122
How about another
jab for good measure?

00:09:21.155 --> 00:09:21.956
Just hold still.

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:23.761
No, thank you!
I'm all better now.

00:09:23.794 --> 00:09:25.263
Oh, but I must I insist!

00:09:25.297 --> 00:09:27.400
Healing up and readying
oneself before a battle

00:09:27.434 --> 00:09:30.642
is an important duty for any
member of the Hero's party.

00:09:30.675 --> 00:09:32.043
It may hurt a little,

00:09:32.077 --> 00:09:34.749
but I guarantee it's nothing
next to the sting of defeat.

00:09:34.782 --> 00:09:37.220
To refuse would be an
insult to all your friends

00:09:37.254 --> 00:09:38.757
down there on
the battlefield.

00:09:40.026 --> 00:09:42.330
When you put it
that way... I'll take it.

00:09:44.335 --> 00:09:45.805
Avan: Maam; do the honors.

00:09:45.838 --> 00:09:47.508
You can use
the rest of those

00:09:47.541 --> 00:09:49.044
to restore everyone
else's Magic Power...

00:09:49.077 --> 00:09:52.317
Then, make sure to top up their
stamina with Healing Magic.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.321
Yes, sir.
B-But what about you?

00:09:54.354 --> 00:09:55.858
I'll go on ahead for a bit.

00:09:55.891 --> 00:09:57.929
Somebody has
to scout the area.

00:09:57.962 --> 00:09:59.264
There are many
more traps ahead.

00:09:59.297 --> 00:10:01.570
We must be careful not
to fall into them...

00:10:01.603 --> 00:10:02.738
But if I find any,

00:10:02.772 --> 00:10:05.276
I'm prepared to
disable them myself.

00:10:08.416 --> 00:10:09.585
Avan: While I'm at it,

00:10:09.619 --> 00:10:11.823
I'll also draw up a map
of the castle's layout.

00:10:11.856 --> 00:10:13.728
Dai: Isn't it
dangerous to go alone?

00:10:13.761 --> 00:10:15.732
Yes. It is. Very good point.

00:10:15.765 --> 00:10:17.902
Therefore, Princess Leona...

00:10:17.936 --> 00:10:19.004
Uh, y-yes?

00:10:19.038 --> 00:10:21.743
Would you be so kind as
to accompany me on my quest?

00:10:21.777 --> 00:10:23.780
M-Me? Are you sure?

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.657
I'd be happy to, sir.

00:10:28.691 --> 00:10:31.396
Good luck getting
these two together, Maam.

00:10:31.429 --> 00:10:33.266
Leona...

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:34.434
Avan: Don't worry.

00:10:34.468 --> 00:10:35.905
We're gonna be
back in no time.

00:10:35.938 --> 00:10:38.209
Stay put even after
you've finished healing,

00:10:38.242 --> 00:10:40.113
otherwise we might lose you.

00:10:40.146 --> 00:10:43.653
When we return, you can tell me
what an excellent cook I am.

00:10:43.687 --> 00:10:45.424
[laughing]

00:10:45.457 --> 00:10:46.325
Lets go.

00:10:46.358 --> 00:10:48.864
Leona: [screaming]

00:10:51.268 --> 00:10:52.705
So... now what?

00:10:53.206 --> 00:10:55.243
I guess we heal up.

00:10:55.276 --> 00:10:57.849
I wonder what kinda
snacks he packed us.

00:10:57.882 --> 00:11:01.523
Dai: Wow. He's still
the same old Master.

00:11:01.556 --> 00:11:02.357
Is he?

00:11:02.391 --> 00:11:03.560
With that new Secret Way,

00:11:03.594 --> 00:11:06.633
it sorta seems like he could
take on King Vearn himself.

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.435
Well, even though
he's here, Popp...

00:11:08.469 --> 00:11:09.773
You can't let
your guard down.

00:11:09.806 --> 00:11:11.476
We should assume
that we'll be fighting

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:13.413
without him like we planned.

00:11:13.446 --> 00:11:15.317
Who's dropping their guard?

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:16.051
Dai: Maam's right.

00:11:16.085 --> 00:11:17.220
We should follow
his orders and

00:11:17.253 --> 00:11:19.692
replenish as much of
our strength as we can.

00:11:19.726 --> 00:11:21.094
Doesn't matter
who wins the fight,

00:11:21.128 --> 00:11:23.600
we all have to
be ready for it.

00:11:23.633 --> 00:11:25.070
I dunno about you,

00:11:25.103 --> 00:11:28.877
but I'm not letting Master risk
his life again for nothing.

00:11:32.585 --> 00:11:34.522
All right, then.
Let's get this over with.

00:11:34.555 --> 00:11:38.362
Can we at least avoid
feathers to the head this time?

00:11:38.396 --> 00:11:39.331
[laughing]

00:11:39.364 --> 00:11:42.471
Maybe we could do it
the old-fashioned way?

00:11:42.505 --> 00:11:44.241
Gomechan: [amused chirping]

00:11:59.171 --> 00:12:01.542
Leona: I'm not sure
I'm following...

00:12:01.576 --> 00:12:03.312
what exactly do
you need me for?

00:12:03.345 --> 00:12:05.951
Because if it's magic,
I should tell you...

00:12:05.985 --> 00:12:09.391
the only Purifying Spell I
know how to cast is Kaglimmer.

00:12:09.424 --> 00:12:10.528
There wasn't enough time to

00:12:10.561 --> 00:12:13.266
learn any others
while I was down there.

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:16.205
It's all right,
Your Highness. I know.

00:12:16.239 --> 00:12:17.174
And as it turns out,

00:12:17.207 --> 00:12:20.346
I brought you along
for a different reason.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:21.849
I want you to have these.

00:12:21.883 --> 00:12:23.485
I'm sure they'll
serve you well.

00:12:24.689 --> 00:12:26.793
You're really
giving these to me?

00:12:27.795 --> 00:12:29.197
But why? They belong to you.

00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:30.901
I believe that when
the time comes,

00:12:30.935 --> 00:12:33.373
you're going to be
the one to take my place.

00:12:33.406 --> 00:12:34.374
Wait, what?

00:12:39.051 --> 00:12:41.021
Zaboera: Forgive me,
Lord Mystvearn.

00:12:41.054 --> 00:12:44.494
They're... Much stronger
than I thought!

00:13:02.932 --> 00:13:05.805
Your Underworld monsters weren't
as tough as they looked...

00:13:05.838 --> 00:13:08.109
A whole horde of chumps.

00:13:08.142 --> 00:13:10.915
Now you two are all we've
got left to deal with.

00:13:10.948 --> 00:13:12.685
You misjudged us.

00:13:12.718 --> 00:13:13.987
These creatures were strong,

00:13:14.021 --> 00:13:16.425
but in the end they were
just a pack of wild beasts.

00:13:16.459 --> 00:13:19.431
They don't know how to
coordinate or work together.

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:21.970
It would appear as if
the humans here today...

00:13:22.004 --> 00:13:23.540
Are quite different.

00:13:23.573 --> 00:13:25.911
With a more purposeful nature.

00:13:36.031 --> 00:13:37.167
Zaboera [thought]:
How charming...

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.237
In that case, I'll have
to coax Mystvearn

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:41.943
into fighting all of these
wretched humans at once.

00:13:41.976 --> 00:13:43.245
Then, when
they're distracted,

00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:46.052
I'll have an
opportunity to escape.

00:13:46.085 --> 00:13:48.657
What other choice do I have?

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:50.795
Zaboera: Lord Mystvearn,
old friend...

00:13:50.828 --> 00:13:52.130
I apologize.

00:13:52.163 --> 00:13:55.036
I had intended to destroy
them for you as a gift...

00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:56.907
But alas, my
devices have proven

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.077
quite useless
against these humans.

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:02.551
Still, they should be no match
for your astonishing might.

00:14:02.584 --> 00:14:03.953
In the meantime,

00:14:03.987 --> 00:14:06.593
I shall return to the palace
to ensure our king's safety.

00:14:06.626 --> 00:14:08.362
Personally, I'm quite confident

00:14:08.395 --> 00:14:10.867
you'll crush these
fools in no time!

00:14:12.505 --> 00:14:15.511
Mystvearn: [laughing]

00:14:15.544 --> 00:14:16.746
Look at you go.

00:14:16.779 --> 00:14:21.021
You're certainly grasping at
straws now, aren't you, Zaboera?

00:14:21.054 --> 00:14:23.359
Mystvearn: King Vearn would
fare better without your help.

00:14:23.393 --> 00:14:26.733
If this was the best you could
manage against an average army,

00:14:26.766 --> 00:14:28.903
how will you take on the Hero?

00:14:29.573 --> 00:14:30.975
It's... complicated.

00:14:31.008 --> 00:14:34.147
Nova [thought]:
Why are they arguing?

00:14:34.181 --> 00:14:36.285
Mystvearn: They say when
you reap what you sow,

00:14:36.318 --> 00:14:38.255
it always comes
at your lowest...

00:14:38.289 --> 00:14:40.728
Thinking you can play me
like one of your pawns

00:14:40.761 --> 00:14:42.163
is as low as it gets.

00:14:42.196 --> 00:14:44.101
I suppose this was inevitable.

00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:47.206
Manipulating others to your
benefit has got you this far.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.547
It was only a matter of time
before someone fought back.

00:14:50.581 --> 00:14:51.850
Your path ends here.

00:14:51.883 --> 00:14:53.185
I am under no obligation

00:14:53.219 --> 00:14:55.390
to offer my help
to the likes of you.

00:14:55.423 --> 00:14:58.964
I shall return to the palace
and guard the Dark King myself.

00:14:58.997 --> 00:15:01.235
Then what am I to do?!

00:15:01.268 --> 00:15:02.403
Mystvearn: Why don't you try

00:15:02.437 --> 00:15:04.407
doing something
yourself for once?!

00:15:06.846 --> 00:15:08.517
Mystvearn: Besides,
we both know that if you

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:11.288
return to the Palace
without any results,

00:15:11.322 --> 00:15:14.060
you'll never see
another sunrise.

00:15:14.094 --> 00:15:16.231
I suggest you
clean up this mess.

00:15:16.264 --> 00:15:19.070
At the very least, show some
effort with these humans,

00:15:19.103 --> 00:15:20.774
and if you're
feeling ambitious,

00:15:20.808 --> 00:15:23.045
disrupt their Magic
Circle of Light.

00:15:23.078 --> 00:15:24.782
Zaboera: But...
How would I?

00:15:24.816 --> 00:15:25.918
Mystvearn: Use your head.

00:15:25.951 --> 00:15:27.822
Perhaps such efforts
from a worm like you

00:15:27.855 --> 00:15:29.992
will inspire
King Vearn's pity.

00:15:31.361 --> 00:15:35.738
Lord Mystvearn, or,
should I say... Mystvearn?

00:15:35.771 --> 00:15:37.875
How could you say
such awful things?

00:15:37.908 --> 00:15:40.480
I'm a fellow veteran
of the Legion Commanders.

00:15:40.514 --> 00:15:43.787
Think of how many battles we've
fought alongside each other.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.356
We're comrades.

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:48.596
How can you abandon me
like this, you traitor!

00:15:49.599 --> 00:15:50.701
Mystvearn: "Comrades..."

00:15:50.734 --> 00:15:52.270
Are you actually resorting to

00:15:52.303 --> 00:15:54.709
the platitudes of
the servants of justice?

00:15:54.742 --> 00:15:58.048
I was wrong.
This is your lowest.

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:00.588
Mystvearn: But either
way, Zaboera...

00:16:00.621 --> 00:16:04.127
If we're the close friends
that you claim us to be...

00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:06.332
then you should
know perfectly well

00:16:06.365 --> 00:16:11.208
what I will say in
situation such as this.

00:16:11.241 --> 00:16:14.649
The same answer it always is;
"The Dark King's w-words..."

00:16:14.682 --> 00:16:17.353
Mystvearn: "... take
precedence above all else."

00:16:17.386 --> 00:16:19.692
Exactly. So why bother asking?

00:16:22.564 --> 00:16:24.067
[defeated sigh]

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:26.873
Crocodine [thought]:
It was inevitable.

00:16:26.906 --> 00:16:28.843
Zaboera spent
decades casting aside

00:16:28.877 --> 00:16:33.754
whole armies of warriors just
to fuel his own ambitions.

00:16:33.787 --> 00:16:39.098
And now, for the first time,
it's him who's been cast aside.

00:16:39.131 --> 00:16:41.201
Mystvearn: This is
where we say goodbye.

00:16:41.234 --> 00:16:43.740
Lon Beruk: Wait a
minute, Mystvearn.

00:16:43.774 --> 00:16:46.746
You're not about to run
off like a coward, are you?

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.284
Because you and I were
in the middle of something.

00:16:49.317 --> 00:16:50.921
Mystvearn: [amused chuckle]

00:16:50.954 --> 00:16:52.725
You can believe
whatever you like.

00:16:52.758 --> 00:16:54.060
There aren't many
in this world

00:16:54.093 --> 00:16:56.464
able to fight me
on equal ground...

00:16:56.498 --> 00:16:59.471
All the same, you may count
yourself as one of them.

00:16:59.505 --> 00:17:02.310
I'm a little relieved,
to tell the truth.

00:17:03.613 --> 00:17:06.184
Mystvearn: You are
an impressive one.

00:17:06.218 --> 00:17:09.959
I imagine if you had fought
me using your full strength,

00:17:09.993 --> 00:17:13.198
our battle wouldn't have
lasted nearly as long.

00:17:13.232 --> 00:17:14.802
Of course, I'm sure
you're aware,

00:17:14.835 --> 00:17:16.739
the same could be
said for me.

00:17:16.773 --> 00:17:18.075
[chuckle]

00:17:18.108 --> 00:17:19.311
Lon Beruk [thought]:
Mystvearn...

00:17:19.344 --> 00:17:21.448
Mystvearn: Farewell
for now, Lon Beruk...

00:17:21.481 --> 00:17:24.588
and you humans with
your unexpected mettle.

00:17:24.622 --> 00:17:26.091
You have my respect.

00:17:26.124 --> 00:17:29.164
I admire anyone with
a powerful body or mind,

00:17:29.197 --> 00:17:31.703
be they ally or enemy.

00:17:31.737 --> 00:17:32.972
I give you my word,

00:17:33.005 --> 00:17:37.079
your achievements on this day
will not soon be forgotten.

00:17:40.219 --> 00:17:41.889
He may have left
us with a compliment,

00:17:41.923 --> 00:17:45.597
but it seems there's one ally
here that he never respected.

00:17:46.432 --> 00:17:49.270
Zaboera, this is
the end for you.

00:17:49.304 --> 00:17:51.107
You're all out of options.

00:17:51.141 --> 00:17:52.577
Crocodine: Surrender now.

00:17:52.611 --> 00:17:55.684
If you retreat to Vearn
Palace, you'll be punished.

00:17:55.718 --> 00:17:58.255
That said, I know you're
not quite stupid enough

00:17:58.289 --> 00:18:02.430
to think you can take
on the rest of us alone.

00:18:02.464 --> 00:18:06.506
Zaobera: "Stupid"...
Stupid, am I?

00:18:06.539 --> 00:18:10.079
[sinister chuckle]

00:18:10.113 --> 00:18:14.054
[cackling]

00:18:14.087 --> 00:18:17.294
Oh, what a joke...
What a sickening joke!

00:18:17.327 --> 00:18:18.462
To have the poster boy

00:18:18.495 --> 00:18:20.667
for idiots everywhere
suggesting that...

00:18:20.701 --> 00:18:22.103
I'm the stupid one -

00:18:22.137 --> 00:18:24.474
is the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard!

00:18:24.509 --> 00:18:27.748
[cackling]

00:18:27.781 --> 00:18:29.117
What'd you say?

00:18:31.623 --> 00:18:34.394
You all think you're
so magnanimous, don't you?

00:18:34.427 --> 00:18:36.298
Zaboera: It's true
that I wasn't able to

00:18:36.332 --> 00:18:38.102
use Mystvearn
as I'd hoped...

00:18:38.135 --> 00:18:40.072
But that's a minor
setback at best.

00:18:40.105 --> 00:18:43.045
Unlike you, I always
prepare a backup plan

00:18:43.078 --> 00:18:44.347
when I enter a battle.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.485
I still have plenty
of ways to fight without

00:18:46.519 --> 00:18:49.424
needing to get my hands dirty.

00:18:49.457 --> 00:18:52.163
There are hundreds of monsters
here who will protect me

00:18:52.197 --> 00:18:54.635
and make quick work of
your insufferable army.

00:18:54.668 --> 00:18:56.539
Hundreds? Are you
out of your mind?

00:18:56.573 --> 00:18:58.409
There's nobody
left to defend you.

00:18:58.442 --> 00:19:00.781
Your blasted monsters
are all half-dead.

00:19:00.814 --> 00:19:04.220
Perhaps, but...
I'm not finished with them.

00:19:13.205 --> 00:19:16.177
No, no. We certainly
can't have that.

00:19:17.948 --> 00:19:19.718
It's a spell.
Watch your backs!

00:19:19.752 --> 00:19:23.926
For what I'm planning,
that won't do at all!

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.922
You fiend!

00:19:37.955 --> 00:19:40.694
Why would you slaughter your
remaining servants like this?

00:19:40.727 --> 00:19:42.665
Who will help you now?

00:19:42.698 --> 00:19:43.766
[snickering]

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.572
I wouldn't expect you to
put it together, Crocodine.

00:19:46.606 --> 00:19:49.912
If I want this to work,
I need them as corpses.

00:19:49.946 --> 00:19:52.384
But - why? What
good's a corpse?

00:19:52.417 --> 00:19:53.686
If they're still alive,

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.025
they can't be part
of my final weapon.

00:19:56.058 --> 00:19:57.159
Weapon?!

00:19:57.193 --> 00:20:00.365
Superior Being Synthesis!

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.294
Zaboera: I've spent many
a long night contemplating

00:20:31.328 --> 00:20:34.300
what my ultimate
power-up could be...

00:20:37.774 --> 00:20:40.580
Superior Beings
are incredibly strong,

00:20:40.613 --> 00:20:44.154
but their life energy
depletes far too quickly.

00:20:44.187 --> 00:20:46.291
Zaboera: I gladly
transformed the others,

00:20:46.325 --> 00:20:50.533
but I'd never perform
the procedure on myself.

00:20:50.567 --> 00:20:53.673
Zaboera: My wish is to do away
with all the gallant sacrifice,

00:20:53.706 --> 00:20:55.510
and remain
completely unharmed

00:20:55.543 --> 00:20:59.183
while I lay waste to my enemies
and conquer the battlefield.

00:20:59.217 --> 00:21:01.354
A "free ride,"
as they say...

00:21:01.388 --> 00:21:04.093
The mindset of an
absolute scoundrel.

00:21:04.126 --> 00:21:06.398
Zaboera: And for
all my thinking...

00:21:06.432 --> 00:21:09.337
this is the result!

00:21:13.011 --> 00:21:16.451
Zaboera: Behold, the
Superior Being Mark Two...

00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:20.292
I suppose I should call it
a Superior Being Zombie!

00:21:20.326 --> 00:21:21.929
Oh, great. A zombie?

00:21:22.831 --> 00:21:25.369
Oh, please. Using size
to your advantage?

00:21:25.402 --> 00:21:26.839
That's the best you can do?

00:21:26.873 --> 00:21:29.512
You'll have to come up with
a better play than this,

00:21:29.545 --> 00:21:31.347
you spineless coward!

00:21:31.381 --> 00:21:32.817
Take that!

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:43.573
Thank you for offering such
a mighty blow, Lon Beruk.

00:21:43.607 --> 00:21:45.677
You've confirmed
my hypothesis.

00:21:45.711 --> 00:21:47.648
Now I have no doubt
that I've created

00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:50.820
an unbeatable Superior entity!

00:21:51.823 --> 00:21:55.496
It can't be. Lon overwhelmed
Mystvearn himself.

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:57.433
Yet against this, his blade...

00:21:57.466 --> 00:21:59.037
It doesn't work.

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:03.779
Zaboera: [menacing chuckle]

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.737
Narrator: Zaboera's
transformation into

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:40.907
a Superior Being Zombie
leaves our heroes

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.878
scrambling to
find a weakness...

00:23:42.911 --> 00:23:44.582
But with an
indestructible hide

00:23:44.615 --> 00:23:47.186
that not even Lon Beruk's
weapons can pierce,

00:23:47.219 --> 00:23:48.957
soon any hope begins to waver.

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:51.260
Just when it seems
that the tables have turned

00:23:51.294 --> 00:23:52.831
in the battle
of Loroi Valley,

00:23:52.864 --> 00:23:55.036
Nova brushes off the
protests of his allies

00:23:55.069 --> 00:23:57.541
and squares off against
the Mystic Bishop.

00:23:57.574 --> 00:23:59.512
Learn who claims the
victory - next time on

00:23:59.545 --> 00:24:01.883
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:01.916 --> 00:24:03.451
"The Other Hero."
