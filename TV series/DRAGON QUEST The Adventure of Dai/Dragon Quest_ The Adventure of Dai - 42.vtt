WEBVTT

00:01:59.105 --> 00:02:00.040
Jank: Here.

00:02:00.073 --> 00:02:01.142
What's that?

00:02:01.175 --> 00:02:03.247
Isn't it time to celebrate?

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.150
You're very generous.

00:02:05.183 --> 00:02:07.187
Lon: You're getting
soft in your old age.

00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:09.025
You're one to talk.

00:02:09.058 --> 00:02:12.666
Lon: The life of a
Darkling is uneventful.

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:15.337
We live a much longer
life than humans do,

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.575
so many of us
have gotten lazy.

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:21.683
Some lives can last
centuries yet still feel empty.

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:26.627
Delicious.

00:02:26.661 --> 00:02:29.666
Not many can feel the
way that I do right now.

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:33.373
In this moment,
I am truly fulfilled.

00:02:34.075 --> 00:02:36.680
That sword was well forged.

00:02:36.714 --> 00:02:40.888
[roaring]

00:02:56.587 --> 00:02:57.855
A true Hero.

00:02:57.889 --> 00:02:59.626
He did it!

00:03:08.944 --> 00:03:12.284
Dai [thought]: I've never
seen anything like it.

00:03:12.318 --> 00:03:14.154
That sword you're holding
is a living thing.

00:03:14.188 --> 00:03:18.296
The choice of when and where to
fight belongs to it, as well.

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.264
Dai: I get it.

00:03:19.298 --> 00:03:20.735
A weapon this destructive

00:03:20.768 --> 00:03:23.541
shouldn't be used
for just anything.

00:03:23.574 --> 00:03:26.813
That's why you seal
yourself away, isn't it?

00:03:29.451 --> 00:03:31.189
I promise I'll only
borrow your strength...

00:03:31.222 --> 00:03:34.194
to fight truly
powerful enemies.

00:03:34.228 --> 00:03:36.833
Or when everyone
needs saving, okay?

00:03:38.804 --> 00:03:40.107
I'm glad to have you...

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.510
On my side.

00:03:42.244 --> 00:03:43.547
Leona: Dai!

00:03:48.858 --> 00:03:49.692
Leona: Huh?

00:03:50.493 --> 00:03:51.830
Oh, come on.
What's he doing now?

00:03:51.863 --> 00:03:54.703
He must have gone to help
the others finish the fight.

00:03:54.736 --> 00:03:57.341
I sense one more
source of evil energy.

00:03:57.374 --> 00:04:01.015
The enemy leader wasn't
the one piloting the colossus?

00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:03.554
Leona: What's the matter?

00:04:04.188 --> 00:04:05.424
I sense...

00:04:05.457 --> 00:04:07.995
That something truly
horrible is about to happen.

00:04:08.731 --> 00:04:10.000
Merle, please wait.

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:11.937
You have to hurry, Dai!

00:04:11.971 --> 00:04:12.772
Everyone-

00:04:12.806 --> 00:04:15.276
Popp and the others
are in danger!

00:04:18.918 --> 00:04:21.523
Hyunckel: I understand you
might be a little shocked,

00:04:21.557 --> 00:04:23.493
but this is unlike you...

00:04:23.527 --> 00:04:26.667
You're wide open, Mystvearn.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.902
Air Strike!

00:04:30.774 --> 00:04:32.912
Hyunckel [thought]: He
didn't even try to dodge.

00:04:36.085 --> 00:04:38.357
That's his Dark Aura!

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.429
Mystvearn: What a
disgraceful failure...

00:04:41.463 --> 00:04:45.705
King Vearn's Sovereign
Rock Castle in ruins.

00:04:45.738 --> 00:04:48.442
This is all because
I failed to recognize

00:04:48.476 --> 00:04:51.115
the power of the
boy's new sword.

00:04:51.148 --> 00:04:55.490
It's all...
It's all my fault!

00:04:55.524 --> 00:05:00.734
[furious roaring]

00:05:02.004 --> 00:05:02.973
Popp: [victorious chuckle]

00:05:03.006 --> 00:05:04.609
Well, how do you like that?!

00:05:04.643 --> 00:05:08.416
That's what you get for severely
underestimating us, buddy.

00:05:09.217 --> 00:05:11.188
Now, I'm going
to finish you off!

00:05:11.222 --> 00:05:12.992
No, wait! Just wait, Popp.

00:05:13.026 --> 00:05:14.729
You can't be so reckless.

00:05:14.762 --> 00:05:16.834
Burn to ashes.

00:05:16.867 --> 00:05:18.436
Sizzle!

00:05:23.648 --> 00:05:27.454
[roaring]

00:05:27.487 --> 00:05:29.693
[worried cries]

00:05:29.726 --> 00:05:32.364
[pained grunts]

00:05:39.913 --> 00:05:41.048
Ow, ow-ow!

00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:44.622
Gah! My tail!
Somebody put me out!

00:05:44.656 --> 00:05:47.361
He... He deflected the
spell right back at us.

00:05:47.394 --> 00:05:48.831
It's worse...

00:05:48.865 --> 00:05:51.603
It feels like the damage from
the spell was amplified, too.

00:05:51.636 --> 00:05:53.306
Hyunckel [thought]:
The impact was closer to

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:54.776
that of a Kasizz spell.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.684
The Dark Aura Decimation Field
and Byut Deathstringer...

00:05:58.717 --> 00:06:01.523
Are they just a fraction
of his true power?

00:06:03.528 --> 00:06:05.363
Mystvearn: So be it.

00:06:05.397 --> 00:06:08.303
I will shed my
Shadow Raiment,

00:06:08.336 --> 00:06:12.511
and erase all
of you right here!

00:06:13.346 --> 00:06:14.816
[worried breaths]

00:06:15.851 --> 00:06:17.956
Mystvearn: Now,
you shall realize that

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:21.229
being crushed by the
Sovereign Rock Castle,

00:06:21.262 --> 00:06:24.301
or destroyed
by my Dark Aura

00:06:24.334 --> 00:06:27.842
would have been a far
less painful defeat.

00:06:27.875 --> 00:06:29.613
I can feel him
getting stronger!

00:06:29.646 --> 00:06:32.117
Even that giant castle
didn't have this much energy!

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.789
The pressure I can feel
coming off of Mystvearn is...

00:06:34.823 --> 00:06:36.259
Way worse.

00:06:36.292 --> 00:06:37.895
[terrified whimpering]

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.747
Hyunckel [thought]: I've
always assumed the source of

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.418
Mystvearn's power
was his Dark Aura.

00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:53.326
But it seems he has
an even greater weapon.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.965
Could the Aura have
been a mere veil-

00:06:55.998 --> 00:06:57.735
covering his true form?

00:06:58.737 --> 00:07:01.944
Mystvearn: Now, witness
my ultimate power...

00:07:01.977 --> 00:07:04.949
The power of Mystvearn!

00:07:17.007 --> 00:07:18.175
[shocked gasps]

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:23.954
Killvearn: ...And stop.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.929
That's enough for now, Myst.

00:07:27.962 --> 00:07:29.198
Mystvearn: Killvearn...

00:07:29.231 --> 00:07:30.333
We're in trouble.

00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:32.137
That's Killvearn, the Reaper!

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:33.306
W-What?!

00:07:33.339 --> 00:07:34.576
The Reaper?

00:07:34.609 --> 00:07:36.145
It's really him?!

00:07:36.178 --> 00:07:38.618
Naughty boy... Naughty boy...

00:07:38.651 --> 00:07:42.091
King Vearn's gonna be angry!

00:07:42.124 --> 00:07:44.061
Killvearn: That's right.

00:07:44.094 --> 00:07:45.531
No matter the circumstances,

00:07:45.564 --> 00:07:47.836
your true form can
only be revealed

00:07:47.869 --> 00:07:51.543
with King Vearn's
permission, can it not?

00:07:52.378 --> 00:07:53.681
Killvearn: Friend or not,

00:07:53.714 --> 00:07:57.855
disobey that rule and I
would be forced to intervene.

00:08:02.064 --> 00:08:03.667
Mystvearn: You're right.

00:08:07.007 --> 00:08:09.378
Apologize! Apologize!

00:08:09.412 --> 00:08:11.148
Killvearn: You heard him.

00:08:11.182 --> 00:08:16.627
Sovereign Rock Castle is only
one of King Vearn's many toys.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.029
With a sincere apology,

00:08:18.062 --> 00:08:21.803
he's sure to forgive
his precious little Myst.

00:08:21.837 --> 00:08:24.676
Better that than adding
to your shame of defeat,

00:08:24.709 --> 00:08:26.045
wouldn't you say?

00:08:28.083 --> 00:08:31.923
Mystvearn: Understood,
I will never fail again.

00:08:31.957 --> 00:08:35.397
Killvearn: Then it's back
to your old quiet self, is it?

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:37.134
[amused chuckle]

00:08:37.167 --> 00:08:38.670
Well, then...

00:08:38.704 --> 00:08:41.275
Killvearn: That settles
it for today, everybody.

00:08:41.643 --> 00:08:42.878
He's coming!

00:08:43.947 --> 00:08:46.520
Killvearn: We'll be
excusing ourselves for now.

00:08:46.553 --> 00:08:47.221
Both: Huh?!

00:08:47.254 --> 00:08:48.724
You're retreating?

00:08:48.758 --> 00:08:51.029
Killvearn: Dai's sword
was quite impressive,

00:08:51.062 --> 00:08:53.768
destroying Sovereign
Rock Castle and all.

00:08:53.801 --> 00:08:56.873
Tell him congratulations
on completing it.

00:08:56.907 --> 00:09:00.280
Now he won't have to worry about
his friends being useless.

00:09:00.313 --> 00:09:01.449
Useless?

00:09:01.482 --> 00:09:02.885
Killvearn: Oh, did I stutter?

00:09:02.919 --> 00:09:06.425
I believe I've cast stronger
magic than you in my sleep.

00:09:06.458 --> 00:09:08.998
Yeah. So useless.

00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:12.303
Killvearn: Anyways...
See you soon.

00:09:12.337 --> 00:09:13.740
Hey! Wait!

00:09:18.249 --> 00:09:19.752
Popp: After all that...

00:09:19.786 --> 00:09:22.925
All the destruction you
brought to this city...

00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:26.966
Don't think you can insult
us and just get away with it!

00:09:28.169 --> 00:09:29.337
Popp, wait!

00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:30.273
Come back!

00:09:30.307 --> 00:09:31.743
Popp - no!

00:09:38.524 --> 00:09:40.160
Popp [thought]:
You won't get away.

00:09:40.193 --> 00:09:43.299
This time, I'm taking
the fight to you!

00:09:44.669 --> 00:09:46.105
That idiot.

00:09:46.139 --> 00:09:47.642
Hey!

00:09:47.675 --> 00:09:48.977
Dai - you're back!

00:09:49.478 --> 00:09:50.614
Are you all okay?

00:09:50.647 --> 00:09:53.320
I could sense a huge
power coming from here.

00:09:53.353 --> 00:09:54.690
And now they're gone,

00:09:54.723 --> 00:09:56.191
with Popp in pursuit.

00:09:56.225 --> 00:09:59.198
Chasing the enemy
alone, like a fool.

00:09:59.231 --> 00:09:59.732
[surprised gasp]

00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:00.901
Please, hurry.

00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:03.106
You might still be able
to catch up to him.

00:10:03.139 --> 00:10:05.476
Hyunckel: His anger
is leading him astray.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.681
And he could be
going into a trap.

00:10:08.984 --> 00:10:10.053
I got it!

00:10:10.086 --> 00:10:11.990
So head northwest.

00:10:16.499 --> 00:10:18.169
Are you sure about this?

00:10:18.202 --> 00:10:21.108
Hyunckel, Dai's power
is not infinite.

00:10:21.141 --> 00:10:24.916
Even with his Dragon Crest
he can be pushed too far.

00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:25.785
Yeah.

00:10:25.818 --> 00:10:27.454
The old Dai would
be done by now...

00:10:27.487 --> 00:10:29.025
After destroying the castle.

00:10:29.058 --> 00:10:31.863
But he made it all
the way here, didn't he?

00:10:31.897 --> 00:10:34.134
He's still in
the fight, somehow.

00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:35.971
You're right.

00:10:36.005 --> 00:10:37.875
Maam: He must
have spent a lot of

00:10:37.908 --> 00:10:40.213
his energy
destroying that thing.

00:10:40.247 --> 00:10:43.653
But he was subconsciously
conserving power.

00:10:45.256 --> 00:10:46.760
He's Popp's only chance.

00:10:46.793 --> 00:10:50.133
Without Dai he'd be
going straight to his doom.

00:10:50.166 --> 00:10:51.101
Maam: What?!

00:10:51.135 --> 00:10:53.139
Killvearn is the
personal undertaker

00:10:53.172 --> 00:10:54.575
for the Dark King Vearn-

00:10:54.609 --> 00:10:57.080
he's tougher than the
other legion commanders.

00:10:58.082 --> 00:10:58.984
It's true.

00:10:59.017 --> 00:11:01.222
No one in the Dark Army
has ever seen him-

00:11:01.255 --> 00:11:03.893
we've only heard
stories of his exploits.

00:11:03.927 --> 00:11:07.702
It's said that if you come
face to face with the reaper,

00:11:07.735 --> 00:11:10.908
then your demise by his
hand is an inevitability.

00:11:10.941 --> 00:11:13.245
What could be that dangerous?!

00:11:14.314 --> 00:11:15.884
What's happening?!

00:11:15.917 --> 00:11:18.991
Hyunckel [thought]: Dai, you
have to bring Popp back...

00:11:19.024 --> 00:11:21.863
Just... don't
fight... head-on!

00:11:23.667 --> 00:11:25.036
Maam: Hyunckel...

00:11:26.238 --> 00:11:27.708
Maam: Hyunckel!

00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:42.237
Killvearn: [delighted chuckle]

00:11:45.644 --> 00:11:46.913
Where'd they-

00:11:48.817 --> 00:11:52.023
This place is...
north of Orzam!

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:58.202
Popp [thought]: I was
so focused on flying.

00:11:58.235 --> 00:11:59.639
Could this be...

00:11:59.673 --> 00:12:02.044
The Field of Death?

00:12:02.077 --> 00:12:04.849
Is this the stronghold
of the Dark Army?!

00:12:20.113 --> 00:12:21.883
Popp [thought]:
There's no mistake.

00:12:21.917 --> 00:12:24.622
This is the infamous
Field of Death.

00:12:24.656 --> 00:12:28.931
Some call it the world's edge
or the last unexplored land...

00:12:28.964 --> 00:12:31.870
An island devoid of any life.

00:12:31.903 --> 00:12:34.909
Nobody has ever
approached it and returned.

00:12:35.611 --> 00:12:37.046
I get it.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.921
It's the perfect place for the
Dark Army to have their base.

00:12:40.955 --> 00:12:43.560
I bet the Dark
King Vearn is here.

00:12:43.593 --> 00:12:46.299
I may have gotten
in over my head.

00:12:46.332 --> 00:12:49.070
I really need to learn
to control myself.

00:12:53.312 --> 00:12:54.882
A flute?

00:13:01.696 --> 00:13:02.931
Popp: Killvearn...

00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:12.316
Both... Both of you?!

00:13:15.657 --> 00:13:17.828
Killvearn: Foolish little boy.

00:13:17.862 --> 00:13:20.300
Did you really think you
could keep up with us

00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:22.772
unless we wanted you to?

00:13:22.805 --> 00:13:26.144
We flew just slow
enough to lead you here,

00:13:26.178 --> 00:13:29.184
and you fell for
it like an amateur.

00:13:29.218 --> 00:13:30.621
Dummy! Ha!

00:13:30.654 --> 00:13:32.223
Killvearn: [amused chuckle]

00:13:32.257 --> 00:13:33.225
Oh, yeah?

00:13:33.259 --> 00:13:34.929
Well, at least I wasn't
dumb enough to reveal

00:13:34.963 --> 00:13:37.000
where my secret
base was hidden.

00:13:37.033 --> 00:13:41.341
Killvearn: You Disciples of Avan
have grown rather forceful.

00:13:41.375 --> 00:13:46.553
I figured it was time to
get around to doing my job.

00:13:46.586 --> 00:13:47.922
What do you mean, "your job"?

00:13:47.955 --> 00:13:49.424
What are you talking about?

00:13:56.172 --> 00:13:58.009
Popp [thought]:
This isn't good.

00:13:58.042 --> 00:14:01.750
Coming here was the
worst idea I've ever had!

00:14:01.783 --> 00:14:02.818
Killvearn: [chuckling]

00:14:02.851 --> 00:14:05.123
Surely, you've guessed by now.

00:14:05.156 --> 00:14:08.897
The way I'm dressed,
my title of Reaper,

00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:13.372
and everything else you
might have heard about me...

00:14:15.009 --> 00:14:19.117
A-ssas-si-na-tion.

00:14:20.119 --> 00:14:21.121
Whoa!

00:14:24.628 --> 00:14:25.764
[pained grunt]

00:14:25.797 --> 00:14:26.934
Popp [thought]: How did he...

00:14:26.967 --> 00:14:30.106
But that attack wasn't
even close to me!

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.743
Killvearn:
Strange, isn't it?

00:14:31.776 --> 00:14:33.245
[playful laugh]

00:14:35.751 --> 00:14:36.552
Wow!

00:14:37.955 --> 00:14:40.192
How's that, you dumb reaper?!

00:14:40.226 --> 00:14:40.827
[laughing]

00:14:40.861 --> 00:14:42.163
Yay! Fire!

00:14:42.197 --> 00:14:44.167
[laughing]

00:14:47.675 --> 00:14:48.610
You missed!

00:14:50.246 --> 00:14:52.618
Popp [thought]: What...
What's going on here?

00:14:52.651 --> 00:14:54.421
Am I dreaming?!

00:14:54.454 --> 00:14:58.095
Killvearn: Oh, it's
something far nastier.

00:15:01.503 --> 00:15:02.370
Killvearn: [chuckling]

00:15:02.403 --> 00:15:04.976
Popp [thought]:
It's an illusion.

00:15:05.009 --> 00:15:08.015
He's tricked me with
some kind of spell.

00:15:14.962 --> 00:15:17.802
Popp [thought]: How?
How is he doing it?!

00:15:17.835 --> 00:15:22.210
I didn't see him cast anything
and he didn't use any items.

00:15:23.846 --> 00:15:26.720
This high-pitched,
whistling noise.

00:15:26.753 --> 00:15:29.390
It's like... a flute.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:31.796
Could it be...

00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:34.602
Killvearn: Bingo.
Now you've got it.

00:15:34.636 --> 00:15:38.208
If only you'd realized
a few seconds earlier.

00:15:42.818 --> 00:15:45.322
[overwhelmed cry]

00:15:47.126 --> 00:15:48.830
Popp [thought]:
What's happening?!

00:15:48.863 --> 00:15:52.638
I can't see.
I can't move either.

00:15:53.707 --> 00:15:55.176
What's going on?!

00:15:55.644 --> 00:15:57.915
No - no!

00:15:57.948 --> 00:15:59.819
Killvearn:
[delighted chuckle]

00:15:59.852 --> 00:16:02.123
I'll tell you before you die.

00:16:02.156 --> 00:16:06.866
My Reaper Flute isn't just
for playing sweet melodies.

00:16:06.899 --> 00:16:10.239
It's a tool that
I can use for my work.

00:16:10.273 --> 00:16:14.615
When I swing my scythe,
air flows through the flute.

00:16:14.648 --> 00:16:19.158
This emits a high-frequency
tone that can barely be heard.

00:16:19.191 --> 00:16:21.394
Upon entering the ears,

00:16:21.428 --> 00:16:26.739
this sound begins disrupting
my opponent's vision...

00:16:26.772 --> 00:16:31.883
In the end, it robs
them of all of their senses.

00:16:31.916 --> 00:16:35.658
That's why it's
called the Reaper Flute:

00:16:35.691 --> 00:16:39.632
It's the last thing
you're ever going to hear.

00:16:40.534 --> 00:16:42.136
Beautiful, isn't it?

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:43.940
Popp: [pained cries]

00:16:43.974 --> 00:16:45.042
[laughing]

00:16:45.075 --> 00:16:46.579
You whiny fool.

00:16:46.612 --> 00:16:47.948
Serves you right!

00:16:47.981 --> 00:16:50.286
Killvearn: Don't
mock him too much.

00:16:50.319 --> 00:16:53.994
Weaklings like him who
learn their little lessons

00:16:54.027 --> 00:16:56.465
become the heart
and soul of their team.

00:16:56.499 --> 00:17:01.274
They're the first of a Hero's
party you'll want to get rid of.

00:17:01.308 --> 00:17:04.014
That's why we lured
him here alone.

00:17:04.047 --> 00:17:06.719
Then lets just end it already!

00:17:06.752 --> 00:17:08.990
Killvearn: Well said, Piroro.

00:17:09.024 --> 00:17:11.194
Well said.

00:17:14.234 --> 00:17:16.204
[excited chuckle]

00:17:19.144 --> 00:17:20.614
[whimpering]

00:17:34.307 --> 00:17:37.079
Killvearn: So,
the boy followed us.

00:17:37.715 --> 00:17:39.451
Hey Popp, you okay?!

00:17:39.484 --> 00:17:40.286
Yeah...

00:17:40.319 --> 00:17:44.093
Aw. But we almost
got to kill him!

00:17:44.996 --> 00:17:46.332
Killvearn: Hold on, Myst.

00:17:46.365 --> 00:17:47.568
Even with your powers

00:17:47.601 --> 00:17:49.237
you'll need to be
careful when approaching

00:17:49.271 --> 00:17:52.043
the Hero when he's
holding that sword.

00:17:52.076 --> 00:17:53.780
I'll take this.

00:17:55.049 --> 00:17:56.719
Dai, you gotta be careful.

00:17:56.752 --> 00:17:58.690
That Reaper Flute is bad news.

00:18:03.633 --> 00:18:04.468
Killvearn: Huh?!

00:18:04.502 --> 00:18:07.007
Oh no! The Reaper Flute
isn't working...

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.375
Why?!

00:18:09.612 --> 00:18:10.313
Piroro: Wh-wh-what?!

00:18:10.346 --> 00:18:12.383
How did he damage it?

00:18:13.653 --> 00:18:16.124
Killvearn: He did it when he
blocked my attack earlier.

00:18:16.157 --> 00:18:17.561
Good going, Dai.

00:18:17.594 --> 00:18:21.001
He uses that weird flute of
his to overpower his enemies.

00:18:21.034 --> 00:18:22.905
I think that by cracking it...

00:18:22.938 --> 00:18:24.374
You might have
prevented him from

00:18:24.408 --> 00:18:26.378
controlling the
sound it makes!

00:18:26.412 --> 00:18:30.486
Oh, really?
Well, that was lucky.

00:18:30.521 --> 00:18:32.390
Dai: We shouldn't take
this fight any further.

00:18:32.423 --> 00:18:35.229
Let's find our
chance and escape.

00:18:35.262 --> 00:18:37.000
Yeah, good idea.

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:39.738
That is if they give
us a chance to do it.

00:18:49.057 --> 00:18:52.898
Killvearn: It looks like we've
come to a bit of a stalemate.

00:18:55.871 --> 00:19:00.379
Killvearn: I see. Yes, they
still have that absurd sword.

00:19:00.413 --> 00:19:04.020
We both want to finish this,
and we both want to run.

00:19:04.054 --> 00:19:06.192
This is frustrating.

00:19:06.225 --> 00:19:08.596
So... who will go first?

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:11.468
Dai [thought]: I can't be
certain my sword will come out.

00:19:11.503 --> 00:19:12.436
What now?

00:19:13.139 --> 00:19:14.976
What now?

00:19:15.009 --> 00:19:16.344
Killvearn: [impatient growl]

00:19:19.752 --> 00:19:22.023
Dai: Popp, can you move?

00:19:22.056 --> 00:19:24.260
Popp: I think I'm
free of the spell.

00:19:24.294 --> 00:19:26.030
Dai: We've got no choice.

00:19:26.064 --> 00:19:28.368
Let's attack and
make a break for it.

00:19:28.402 --> 00:19:29.905
Popp: I'm with you.

00:19:30.708 --> 00:19:31.843
Killvearn: Showtime.

00:19:31.876 --> 00:19:38.422
[charging roars]

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:53.252
Hadlar?!

00:19:53.285 --> 00:19:56.491
Y-You... You're still alive?!

00:20:07.614 --> 00:20:11.087
Hadlar: Sorry to have kept
you waiting, Mystvearn.

00:20:11.121 --> 00:20:14.260
My improvements
were just completed.

00:20:14.293 --> 00:20:17.701
Now it's my turn to help you.

00:20:17.735 --> 00:20:18.570
Mystvearn: Hadlar...

00:20:18.603 --> 00:20:20.473
What? What "improvements"?!

00:20:20.507 --> 00:20:22.644
Nothing's changed about him.

00:20:25.551 --> 00:20:29.191
Hadlar: Dai, you will
fight me here, and now.

00:20:29.224 --> 00:20:31.228
In one on one combat.

00:20:31.261 --> 00:20:33.833
It'll be fair and equal, boy.

00:20:35.002 --> 00:20:35.937
W-What?!

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:38.844
You're the last
guy to fight fair.

00:20:38.877 --> 00:20:41.982
Hadlar: I've cast
aside my pride and even

00:20:42.016 --> 00:20:45.456
my Darkling body
to fight here today.

00:20:45.489 --> 00:20:48.830
I have but one
single wish remaining:

00:20:49.865 --> 00:20:52.070
To finally destroy the Hero,

00:20:52.103 --> 00:20:53.940
the legacy of my rival,

00:20:53.974 --> 00:20:56.344
that self-righteous Avan!

00:21:00.554 --> 00:21:02.089
Dai [thought]: My sword...

00:21:02.122 --> 00:21:04.193
It unlocked
without hesitation!

00:21:04.227 --> 00:21:05.429
It must realize that

00:21:05.463 --> 00:21:09.270
Hadlar is far more
powerful than ever before

00:21:09.304 --> 00:21:11.441
-than anything I've faced!

00:21:14.214 --> 00:21:16.418
[roaring]

00:21:16.451 --> 00:21:19.257
Hey, don't burn all the
energy from your Dragon Crest.

00:21:19.291 --> 00:21:21.295
You've got to
pace yourself, Dai!

00:21:21.328 --> 00:21:24.300
He's not the Hadlar we knew!

00:21:24.333 --> 00:21:27.607
Dai: If I don't use my
full strength - it's over!

00:21:28.509 --> 00:21:29.344
[excited laughter]

00:21:29.377 --> 00:21:31.783
Yes! Brilliant observation.

00:21:31.816 --> 00:21:34.555
You're worthy of battle.

00:21:36.826 --> 00:21:37.694
[surprised breath]

00:21:37.727 --> 00:21:38.763
[shocked gasps]

00:22:00.005 --> 00:22:01.408
End of the road.

00:22:01.441 --> 00:22:03.679
For Avan's Disciples.

00:23:37.835 --> 00:23:40.673
Narrator: As Hadlar
unleashes a storm of vengeance,

00:23:40.707 --> 00:23:43.679
Dai struggles against
this fearsome new power,

00:23:43.713 --> 00:23:47.019
even with the full force
of his Draconic Aura.

00:23:48.055 --> 00:23:50.158
With the Dark Commander's
strength and resolve

00:23:50.192 --> 00:23:52.030
beyond anything
he's ever faced,

00:23:52.063 --> 00:23:54.968
will Dai's new blade
live up to the challenge?
