WEBVTT

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:53.928
It's not over.

00:01:53.962 --> 00:01:55.164
That's the stance...

00:01:55.197 --> 00:01:56.767
Avan Strash!

00:02:01.442 --> 00:02:02.411
[gasp]

00:02:05.384 --> 00:02:07.421
You call that Avan Strash?

00:02:07.454 --> 00:02:10.928
What a joke. It was
just a cheap imitation!

00:02:11.863 --> 00:02:12.899
Hyunckel: You know the lesson,

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:16.306
"Slice the earth,
slice the sea, slice the air.

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:20.047
And what slices everything
is the Avan Strash."

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.885
Fighting you, I can tell
you haven't mastered

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:25.592
the Avan Style
Sword Technique yet!

00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:26.192
[frustrated grunt]

00:02:26.225 --> 00:02:27.494
That's right.

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:30.601
You're still missing the
third skill, the Air Slash.

00:02:30.634 --> 00:02:31.837
The Air Slash?

00:02:32.873 --> 00:02:34.441
Dai [thought]:
That's right...

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.145
Avan: Dai...

00:02:36.178 --> 00:02:38.584
Even if you breeze through
the Special Hard Course,

00:02:38.617 --> 00:02:42.659
you'll probably learn
Air Slash on the seventh day.

00:02:42.693 --> 00:02:43.628
The last?

00:02:43.661 --> 00:02:47.702
Yes. It's that difficult
of a skill to learn.

00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:49.606
Dai [thought]: But I
only ended up training

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:51.910
with Master Avan for
three days.

00:02:53.446 --> 00:02:55.618
Hyunckel: Even I
can't use Air Slash.

00:02:55.652 --> 00:02:59.291
It's the greatest of the
Avan Style Sword Techniques.

00:02:59.325 --> 00:03:01.597
It's only when
Earth, Wave, and Air

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.601
have all been
mastered by the user,

00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:07.341
that the Avan Strash
reveals its ultimate power.

00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:08.811
And so, as it stands

00:03:08.844 --> 00:03:12.318
your attack is nothing but
an incomplete imitation.

00:03:12.351 --> 00:03:14.455
Even I am not capable of it.

00:03:16.092 --> 00:03:17.962
Avan Strash!

00:03:20.868 --> 00:03:21.837
[pained yell]

00:03:23.641 --> 00:03:24.542
Popp: Dai!

00:03:27.816 --> 00:03:30.788
So, I guess you two
are up next? How adorable.

00:03:30.822 --> 00:03:34.195
We won't let you use
Master Avan's skills for evil!

00:03:34.228 --> 00:03:36.366
Hyunckel:
Three against one...

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:39.773
Well, then I'll have
to use my secret weapon.

00:03:42.111 --> 00:03:44.716
As a warrior,
I can't use spells.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.559
So the Dark King Vearn
gave me a powerful solution.

00:03:49.592 --> 00:03:53.667
A supreme armor that repels
any and all attack spells.

00:03:53.701 --> 00:03:57.007
When I wear it,
I become invincible!

00:03:57.041 --> 00:03:58.711
Supreme armor, huh?

00:03:58.744 --> 00:04:00.982
I don't see any
armor around here.

00:04:01.015 --> 00:04:03.419
Oh, no? It's right
in front of you!

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:06.492
Hyunckel: Amdo!

00:04:18.316 --> 00:04:19.552
[alarmed gasps]

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:27.536
His sword is his armor?!

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:29.606
Hyunckel: This Dark
Armor Blade is both

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.847
the mightiest weapon and
the mightiest defense.

00:04:35.918 --> 00:04:36.753
He's bluffing.

00:04:36.787 --> 00:04:37.755
Let's go!

00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:40.293
Frizzle!

00:04:47.642 --> 00:04:48.978
Popp: If that didn't work...

00:04:49.011 --> 00:04:50.648
How about this?!

00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:52.050
Sizz!

00:04:58.631 --> 00:04:59.566
C'mon!

00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:05.544
Popp!

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.120
Seriously, nothing?
I just learned that spell!

00:05:10.153 --> 00:05:11.289
[worried chirp]

00:05:11.322 --> 00:05:13.427
Hyunckel: Now do you
see how I'm invincible?

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.096
I told you this armor is

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:17.101
impervious to all
attack spells...

00:05:17.134 --> 00:05:19.205
And no one in
the world can best me

00:05:19.238 --> 00:05:21.576
when it comes to
fighting with a sword.

00:05:25.317 --> 00:05:29.158
Stand down. I won't
fight a woman.

00:05:29.191 --> 00:05:31.295
Maam: Do not
underestimate me-

00:05:31.328 --> 00:05:33.968
women can risk
it all in battle.

00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:37.107
Hyunckel: Let me guess...
A lesson from Avan?

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.911
You learned it too,
didn't you?!

00:05:38.944 --> 00:05:41.382
I know that Master Avan
would never grant

00:05:41.415 --> 00:05:44.322
one of his Insignias
to someone who's unworthy!

00:05:44.355 --> 00:05:46.092
Maam: I know that deep down-

00:05:46.125 --> 00:05:49.566
Hyunckel:
What? You mean this?

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:51.537
[shocked gasps]

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.005
Maam: How could you?!

00:05:54.108 --> 00:05:55.477
Hyunckel: I don't need it.

00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:57.549
I only carried
that relic around

00:05:57.582 --> 00:06:01.723
to help me find
Avan or his disciples...

00:06:01.757 --> 00:06:05.631
so I could have the pleasure
of killing them myself!

00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:09.304
But, why?! I don't understand
why you hate him so much!

00:06:09.338 --> 00:06:11.443
Hyunckel: Because
Avan is a murderer.

00:06:11.476 --> 00:06:13.780
The killer of my father!

00:06:13.814 --> 00:06:14.882
He what?!

00:06:16.787 --> 00:06:18.456
Hyunckel: This
continent of Holkia

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.197
was once the Dark
Lord Hadlar's base.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.005
The old Dark Army descended on
the world like a blight.

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:27.541
The casualties were many.

00:06:28.677 --> 00:06:36.325
[crying]

00:06:36.359 --> 00:06:37.394
Bartos: Poor thing.

00:06:37.427 --> 00:06:38.831
Hyunckel: I was a child, then.

00:06:38.864 --> 00:06:42.171
I was raised in
Hadlar's Underground Palace

00:06:42.204 --> 00:06:44.977
by the Armful, Bartos.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.149
The only reason he was
allowed to keep a human child

00:06:48.183 --> 00:06:52.993
was because he was the strongest
knight in all the Dark Army...

00:06:53.026 --> 00:06:55.531
And he was the guardian
of the Hell Gate,

00:06:55.564 --> 00:06:58.737
which led to the
Dark Lord's chambers.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.975
Bartos: I shall
name you Hyunckel

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:05.350
after the legendary swordsman
who once ruled the Underworld.

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:06.953
[happy babble]

00:07:06.987 --> 00:07:09.458
[laughing]

00:07:09.491 --> 00:07:11.930
Hyunckel: I wasn't permitted
to leave the Palace,

00:07:11.963 --> 00:07:14.434
but I grew up without
ever questioning it.

00:07:14.468 --> 00:07:16.472
[babbling]

00:07:16.506 --> 00:07:17.942
Hyunckel: Ta-da!

00:07:17.976 --> 00:07:19.345
Oh, is this for me?

00:07:19.378 --> 00:07:20.113
Hyunckel: Yeah!

00:07:20.147 --> 00:07:20.981
Wow!

00:07:23.286 --> 00:07:24.889
[delighted laugh]

00:07:24.923 --> 00:07:27.094
Hyunckel: He may have
been feared in battle,

00:07:27.127 --> 00:07:28.531
but as my father,

00:07:28.564 --> 00:07:31.770
Bartos was the first
man to teach me warmth.

00:07:32.638 --> 00:07:34.543
Dai [thought]:
He's just like me.

00:07:34.576 --> 00:07:36.513
Hyunckel: But then,
one day...

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:40.287
Bartos, sir.
The Hero is attacking!

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.990
He's finally come.

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:47.268
Bartos: Hyunckel, as
guardian of the Dark Lord,

00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:49.539
it's my duty fight the Hero.

00:07:49.572 --> 00:07:52.378
It's possible I won't survive.

00:07:52.411 --> 00:07:53.714
Dad...

00:07:54.917 --> 00:07:57.589
Listen - you mustn't
leave this place.

00:07:57.622 --> 00:08:00.861
If I don't return, promise
me you'll grow up strong!

00:08:01.162 --> 00:08:02.163
Dad...

00:08:02.966 --> 00:08:04.134
Dad!

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.724
[howling]

00:08:15.758 --> 00:08:18.163
Hyunckel: With the
Dark Lords cry of defeat,

00:08:18.196 --> 00:08:19.966
everything fell silent.

00:08:23.874 --> 00:08:24.776
Dad!

00:08:30.554 --> 00:08:31.890
Hyunckel: No...

00:08:32.324 --> 00:08:33.292
Dad!

00:08:38.369 --> 00:08:39.973
Hyunckel:
Unlike other monsters,

00:08:40.006 --> 00:08:41.943
the Undead cannot
sustain themselves

00:08:41.977 --> 00:08:44.549
without the
Dark Lord's presence.

00:08:44.583 --> 00:08:45.885
With Hadlar's death,

00:08:45.918 --> 00:08:50.159
and the loss of his
Dark Power, my father...

00:08:50.627 --> 00:08:53.600
H-Hyunckel...

00:08:57.508 --> 00:08:58.977
Dad, no!

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:04.187
Hyunckel... Thank you
for the memories.

00:09:08.564 --> 00:09:10.133
Hyunckel:
He crumbled to dust.

00:09:12.171 --> 00:09:14.307
Dad!

00:09:14.341 --> 00:09:18.551
[wailing]

00:09:18.584 --> 00:09:19.986
Hyunckel: It's ironic.

00:09:20.019 --> 00:09:24.395
The man who happened to
find me was Avan himself.

00:09:24.428 --> 00:09:25.731
Who are you?

00:09:28.103 --> 00:09:29.606
Hyunckel.

00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:32.177
Hyunckel: He had no
way of knowing who I was.

00:09:32.211 --> 00:09:36.853
Perhaps he assumed I was some
child the monsters had captured.

00:09:36.887 --> 00:09:40.827
But I knew immediately
that he was the Hero,

00:09:40.861 --> 00:09:44.602
and the one responsible for
what happened to my father.

00:09:45.737 --> 00:09:47.173
At that moment,

00:09:47.207 --> 00:09:51.281
I swore that I'd gain the
strength to one day defeat him.

00:09:51.315 --> 00:09:55.223
That's why I became Avan's
student and learned to fight.

00:09:55.256 --> 00:09:58.997
So that I could defeat
him with what he'd taught me.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.032
Maam: Stop it!

00:10:00.935 --> 00:10:02.839
I know how you feel,
but Master Avan...

00:10:02.872 --> 00:10:06.679
Hyunckel: What?
Was fighting for justice?

00:10:07.949 --> 00:10:09.418
Hyunckel: Justice or not,

00:10:09.451 --> 00:10:13.793
it doesn't change the fact that
he took everything from me.

00:10:14.595 --> 00:10:17.702
My father was
reduced to ashes.

00:10:17.735 --> 00:10:23.245
If that is justice... then
justice itself is my enemy!

00:10:24.983 --> 00:10:27.053
Hyunckel: Now
to finish you off...

00:10:27.087 --> 00:10:31.696
I'll show you the special attack
that I intended to use on Avan!

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.700
A sword from his helmet?!

00:10:36.072 --> 00:10:37.207
Take this!

00:10:38.309 --> 00:10:39.177
Look out!

00:10:43.319 --> 00:10:44.689
Maam: Dai! Popp!

00:10:44.722 --> 00:10:46.258
[pained groans]

00:10:48.096 --> 00:10:49.999
Hyunckel: This is
the attack I developed

00:10:50.033 --> 00:10:53.807
just to defeat the Avan
Style Sword Technique...

00:10:54.609 --> 00:10:56.980
It's called Bloody Scryde!

00:10:58.182 --> 00:10:59.953
Avan: Congratulations,
Hyunckel.

00:10:59.986 --> 00:11:01.656
You've officially
gained the skills

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.094
of a full-fledged warrior.

00:11:04.127 --> 00:11:07.233
And so, I present
you with this.

00:11:09.438 --> 00:11:10.574
This is...

00:11:10.607 --> 00:11:13.747
Avan: Consider it a
graduation certificate.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:17.087
But you're far from being
a complete warrior.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.991
Your blade work,
while commendable,

00:11:19.024 --> 00:11:22.297
seems to have a strange
malice or animosity to it.

00:11:23.734 --> 00:11:25.036
Master...

00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:26.105
What's wrong?

00:11:26.138 --> 00:11:29.311
Hyunckel: Do you know a
man by the name of Bartos?

00:11:30.514 --> 00:11:31.650
Hyunckel, I...

00:11:31.683 --> 00:11:33.720
Hyunckel: Bartos
was the strongest knight

00:11:33.754 --> 00:11:35.958
in all of the Dark Army...

00:11:35.991 --> 00:11:37.460
and he was my father.

00:11:37.493 --> 00:11:38.663
[shocked gasp]

00:11:38.697 --> 00:11:41.636
And so the malice that you
sense in my blade?

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:45.277
It's my hatred towards you
for murdering him!

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.213
Wait a minute, Hyunckel!

00:11:47.246 --> 00:11:48.482
[attacking roar]

00:11:51.556 --> 00:11:52.791
[pained yell]

00:11:53.459 --> 00:11:54.394
Hyunckel!

00:11:55.731 --> 00:11:56.933
Avan: Hold on!

00:12:00.206 --> 00:12:02.177
Avan [thought]:
What have I done?

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.249
I fought back
without even thinking.

00:12:05.283 --> 00:12:09.224
But if I hadn't, I'm sure he
would have killed me.

00:12:09.258 --> 00:12:14.234
Such talent with a blade...
He strikes like a demon.

00:12:14.268 --> 00:12:17.942
Hyunckel! Hyunckel!

00:12:29.298 --> 00:12:30.333
Avan...

00:12:30.366 --> 00:12:33.674
Hyunckel: I failed, and
the only reason I survived

00:12:33.707 --> 00:12:36.179
was because the Dark
King's trusted servant,

00:12:36.212 --> 00:12:39.719
Mystvearn the
Shadow Vizier, rescued me.

00:12:39.752 --> 00:12:41.990
Since then, I've
continued to train

00:12:42.024 --> 00:12:44.628
as a warrior for
the Dark Army.

00:12:44.662 --> 00:12:49.137
Now, my own attack far surpasses
the power of Avan Strash!

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.008
Hyunckel: Your
foolhardy dodging

00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:53.781
has only drawn out
your suffering.

00:12:53.814 --> 00:12:55.917
Let me end it for you!

00:13:10.914 --> 00:13:12.117
Dai [thought]: He's strong.

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:15.156
Stronger than anyone
we've faced before...

00:13:15.189 --> 00:13:17.493
Could he really be
invincible?

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:21.168
No way. I don't
believe it.

00:13:21.201 --> 00:13:24.508
Everyone has a weakness,
no matter how strong they are!

00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:29.451
Hyunckel: That's enough.

00:13:29.484 --> 00:13:31.221
No way. I'm never giving up!

00:13:31.254 --> 00:13:34.461
Even if that bullet
contains a Kasizz or Kaboom,

00:13:34.494 --> 00:13:36.432
it will be of no use to you.

00:13:36.465 --> 00:13:39.271
You will not be able to
scratch my armor.

00:13:39.304 --> 00:13:40.340
Well, let's see.

00:13:40.373 --> 00:13:42.878
You never know unless
you try, isn't that right?

00:13:47.855 --> 00:13:49.457
What is this? Dazzle?!

00:13:51.596 --> 00:13:53.232
A foolish game.

00:14:00.981 --> 00:14:02.584
[pained grunt]

00:14:04.054 --> 00:14:06.893
I can sense your presence
using my inner eye.

00:14:06.926 --> 00:14:09.031
Your Dazzle spell is useless.

00:14:09.064 --> 00:14:10.499
[concerned chirps]

00:14:10.534 --> 00:14:11.936
No, Maam!

00:14:14.809 --> 00:14:16.144
Dai [thought]:
Right there!

00:14:16.178 --> 00:14:20.555
If I aim it just right,
an attack spell should work.

00:14:20.588 --> 00:14:22.256
It's all or nothing...

00:14:23.125 --> 00:14:24.427
Frizz!

00:14:28.671 --> 00:14:30.139
Dai: He blocked it!

00:14:32.377 --> 00:14:33.346
Hyunckel: You brat!

00:14:33.379 --> 00:14:34.481
Look out! Move it!

00:14:37.555 --> 00:14:38.388
Frizz!

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.132
Is that a Wave Slash?!

00:14:48.643 --> 00:14:52.284
You have no power, yet you
insist on troubling me!

00:14:52.317 --> 00:14:53.252
C'mon...

00:14:59.297 --> 00:15:01.468
Hyunckel: You do have spirit.

00:15:01.503 --> 00:15:03.506
That much is worth praise.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:06.345
Popp [thought]: Is Dai
really no match for him?

00:15:06.378 --> 00:15:09.251
I mean, sure he's
a great swordsman,

00:15:09.284 --> 00:15:13.392
but Dai's defeated Crocodine,
and even Lord Hadlar!

00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:16.933
I know. It's that mark!

00:15:16.966 --> 00:15:18.369
Whatever it is,

00:15:18.402 --> 00:15:22.477
the mark has always allowed Dai
to use extraordinary power!

00:15:24.682 --> 00:15:27.053
Dai! Don't hold back!

00:15:27.086 --> 00:15:30.828
C'mon! You've gotta
use the power of that mark!

00:15:30.861 --> 00:15:34.535
Enough babbling.
He's all but finished.

00:15:34.569 --> 00:15:36.071
Popp: What's wrong, Dai?!

00:15:36.105 --> 00:15:39.044
Get mad!
Get mad and fight, now!

00:15:39.077 --> 00:15:41.516
Popp: You have to!
Come on!

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:47.294
Hyunckel: My father
was reduced to ashes.

00:15:47.327 --> 00:15:53.205
If that is justice...
then justice itself is my enemy!

00:15:53.239 --> 00:15:54.542
Dai!

00:15:54.576 --> 00:15:55.511
This should keep you from

00:15:55.544 --> 00:15:58.550
pulling any more of
your bothersome tricks.

00:16:04.828 --> 00:16:05.898
What is that?!

00:16:05.931 --> 00:16:08.770
[pained groans]

00:16:08.804 --> 00:16:11.074
Hyunckel: Dark
Puppetry Aura Hand!

00:16:11.108 --> 00:16:15.216
This particular skill uses
a Dark Aura to bind the enemy.

00:16:15.249 --> 00:16:19.659
It is typically used to take
control of the undead forces.

00:16:19.692 --> 00:16:20.727
Let... me...

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:24.067
Hyunckel: And now,
you're nothing but my puppet.

00:16:24.368 --> 00:16:25.169
No!

00:16:25.704 --> 00:16:28.041
So, this is the end...

00:16:29.846 --> 00:16:33.218
Now die. Bloody Scryde!

00:16:35.924 --> 00:16:37.393
What did he-

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.499
Hyunckel: Impossible!

00:16:40.801 --> 00:16:41.736
[scoff]

00:16:41.769 --> 00:16:43.640
Don't be so sure.

00:16:43.673 --> 00:16:46.044
But, you... I thought...

00:16:48.482 --> 00:16:49.685
Crocodine...

00:16:49.718 --> 00:16:50.955
You survived?!

00:16:50.988 --> 00:16:52.992
What is the meaning of this?

00:16:53.025 --> 00:16:55.195
Just what it looks like.

00:16:55.229 --> 00:16:57.466
Crocodine: I'm here
to protect Dai.

00:16:59.505 --> 00:17:01.809
[roaring]

00:17:03.546 --> 00:17:04.582
You there, boy!

00:17:04.616 --> 00:17:05.618
Popp: Uh... Yes sir?

00:17:05.651 --> 00:17:09.659
Come, take Dai and
escape with the Garuda!

00:17:09.692 --> 00:17:10.694
Huh?!

00:17:11.963 --> 00:17:14.100
Crocodine: You're still too weak
to defeat Hyunckel yourselves!

00:17:14.134 --> 00:17:15.738
You have to escape!

00:17:15.771 --> 00:17:17.206
Popp: But...

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.748
Crocodine: Some monsters will
only obey my direct commands.

00:17:20.781 --> 00:17:23.151
That Garuda is one of them.

00:17:23.553 --> 00:17:24.755
But, Maam...

00:17:26.192 --> 00:17:27.661
Don't be concerned.

00:17:27.695 --> 00:17:28.964
She'll be all right.

00:17:28.997 --> 00:17:31.034
Hyunckel isn't the
type to harm the girl,

00:17:31.067 --> 00:17:33.239
no matter what
the situation is.

00:17:33.272 --> 00:17:35.711
I'll do everything
I can to help her,

00:17:35.744 --> 00:17:38.683
but right now you must
get Dai out of here.

00:17:38.717 --> 00:17:41.488
Do you really think that
I'll just let that happen?!

00:17:41.522 --> 00:17:45.329
I am still one of the
Dark Army's Legion Commanders.

00:17:45.362 --> 00:17:48.469
I can take you down
with me if I have to!

00:17:48.503 --> 00:17:52.544
Hyunckel: You can't. You don't
have the strength right now!

00:17:52.577 --> 00:17:55.082
[pained roar]

00:17:55.482 --> 00:17:56.719
That's right.

00:17:56.753 --> 00:18:01.194
Your armor may be brand new,
but I can still tell.

00:18:01.228 --> 00:18:03.065
The wounds from your
previous battle

00:18:03.098 --> 00:18:06.138
still haven't fully healed.

00:18:06.171 --> 00:18:08.276
Hyunckel: Your steel
hide is nothing more than

00:18:08.309 --> 00:18:11.114
a cracked shield right now!

00:18:11.148 --> 00:18:12.483
Crocodine!

00:18:13.018 --> 00:18:16.759
[pained growl]

00:18:17.561 --> 00:18:18.763
No! Curse you!

00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:21.235
Let go!

00:18:21.268 --> 00:18:23.305
Crocodine: You'll
have to finish me off.

00:18:24.575 --> 00:18:26.144
[roaring]

00:18:27.313 --> 00:18:27.982
Wait! Maam's still...

00:18:28.015 --> 00:18:28.716
Popp: Put me down!

00:18:34.796 --> 00:18:35.864
Hyunckel: Crocodine!

00:18:35.897 --> 00:18:39.605
Out of all the Dark King's Six
Legion Commanders,

00:18:39.639 --> 00:18:44.213
I believe that at least you and
Baran were worthy of respect.

00:18:44.247 --> 00:18:47.955
How disappointing that
you'd submit to a brat.

00:18:47.988 --> 00:18:50.426
I just couldn't stand seeing

00:18:50.459 --> 00:18:54.134
someone who bested
me lose to someone else.

00:18:54.167 --> 00:18:56.238
Hyunckel:
A loser's argument.

00:18:56.271 --> 00:18:58.810
How the Beast King has fallen.

00:18:58.844 --> 00:19:02.183
If you refuse to get out
of my way, Crocodine,

00:19:02.216 --> 00:19:05.523
I'm just going to have
to run right through you!

00:19:06.025 --> 00:19:07.728
Crocodine: So be it!

00:19:07.762 --> 00:19:10.801
Why would you care
so much about them?!

00:19:10.834 --> 00:19:12.537
They don't deserve it.

00:19:12.571 --> 00:19:16.077
They are the sworn
enemies of our Dark Army!

00:19:16.111 --> 00:19:18.281
Oh, "Our Dark Army?"

00:19:18.716 --> 00:19:19.818
[amused chuckle]

00:19:19.852 --> 00:19:20.920
Hyunckel: What's so funny?

00:19:21.655 --> 00:19:22.858
If you ask me,

00:19:22.891 --> 00:19:26.733
it never seemed as if you were
fighting for the Dark Army.

00:19:26.766 --> 00:19:28.737
Crocodine: It always
looked more like you were

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:32.476
fighting out of anger
towards the humans.

00:19:34.046 --> 00:19:35.650
I was the same.

00:19:36.553 --> 00:19:39.224
Crocodine: I looked
down on humans.

00:19:39.257 --> 00:19:44.234
I thought they were puny,
pathetic creatures.

00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:48.342
But fighting Dai and his
friends made me realize...

00:19:48.375 --> 00:19:52.384
that they are strong
and compassionate beings.

00:19:52.417 --> 00:19:54.354
They can work together,

00:19:54.387 --> 00:19:57.426
sharing their joy as
well as their sadness.

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:02.103
They're not like us monsters,
who are alone in our strength!

00:20:02.137 --> 00:20:04.407
Quiet. Enough of
your nonsense!

00:20:04.441 --> 00:20:09.518
There's no way you can't realize
the greatness within you.

00:20:09.552 --> 00:20:13.559
Don't you see that you
are lying to yourself?!

00:20:14.828 --> 00:20:16.064
I said enough!

00:20:16.097 --> 00:20:19.838
[pained roar]

00:20:28.188 --> 00:20:29.925
Hyunckel: Tears?

00:20:36.438 --> 00:20:40.513
It's good... to be human.

00:20:40.547 --> 00:20:45.623
When I am reborn, I hope
it's as... one of them.

00:20:48.262 --> 00:20:49.932
Crocodine...

00:20:49.965 --> 00:20:53.272
[devious laughter]

00:20:53.305 --> 00:20:54.608
Ah, Moruge.

00:20:54.642 --> 00:20:57.981
Is there a problem,
Master Hyunckel?

00:20:58.984 --> 00:21:00.452
Moruge: Oh, my!
Isn't that...

00:21:00.486 --> 00:21:01.856
Tend to his wounds.

00:21:01.889 --> 00:21:05.263
Moruge: Sir, I don't see
how he's going to survive.

00:21:05.296 --> 00:21:08.068
I am aware.
Consider it mercy.

00:21:08.102 --> 00:21:11.274
Hyunckel: And take this woman
to the Underground Palace.

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:13.613
Huh? And who is she?

00:21:13.646 --> 00:21:16.285
Hyunckel: A captive.
Throw her in a cell.

00:21:16.318 --> 00:21:17.621
Moruge: Yes, sir!

00:21:18.656 --> 00:21:20.660
Hyunckel: So long
as I have her,

00:21:20.694 --> 00:21:23.700
they're sure to
come to her rescue.

00:21:23.733 --> 00:21:27.406
And when they do,
I'll finish them!

00:21:31.048 --> 00:21:32.651
Popp: Dai! You're awake.

00:21:33.318 --> 00:21:36.158
Hey, Popp? What's going on?

00:21:36.191 --> 00:21:37.594
Where's Hyunckel?!

00:21:38.563 --> 00:21:42.337
He beat us...
But Crocodine helped us escape.

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:43.874
And where's Maam?

00:21:43.907 --> 00:21:45.877
Hopefully, she's okay.

00:21:49.619 --> 00:21:51.589
They're already
on our tail?!

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.664
Man: Hey!
Are you hurt?!

00:21:55.698 --> 00:21:57.567
One of you wouldn't
happen to be Dai,

00:21:57.601 --> 00:21:59.203
by any chance, would you?!

00:21:59.237 --> 00:22:01.074
Wait, how does
he know my name?

00:22:01.108 --> 00:22:03.111
First of all,
who are you?!

00:23:37.834 --> 00:23:40.239
Narrator: Thanks to
Crocodine's sacrifice,

00:23:40.272 --> 00:23:42.176
Dai and Popp
plan to rescue Maam

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:44.380
from the clutches of
the Dark Army.

00:23:44.414 --> 00:23:48.121
But the Underground Palace is
more treacherous than expected,

00:23:48.155 --> 00:23:49.625
and soon Hyunckel attacks

00:23:49.658 --> 00:23:52.430
with an even more
overwhelming strength.

00:23:52.463 --> 00:23:55.570
The battle to save Maam
is only beginning...

00:23:55.604 --> 00:23:57.273
