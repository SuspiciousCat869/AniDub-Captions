WEBVTT

00:01:50.354 --> 00:01:51.890
Killvearn: Meanwhile...

00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:56.332
I will take care of the mage.

00:01:58.938 --> 00:02:00.942
Do you think we
finish him this time?

00:02:00.976 --> 00:02:02.377
Killvearn: Oh, of course.

00:02:02.411 --> 00:02:04.916
Hadlar already took
care of the Hero.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.555
The mage may be
a smaller fish,

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:10.929
but I'd lose some of my
reputation if I let him go.

00:02:10.962 --> 00:02:12.866
Why, you...

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:14.335
Bring it on.

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:17.208
I'm willing to fight until the
very last breath, you hear me?

00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:18.511
Killvearn: [mocking chuckle]

00:02:18.544 --> 00:02:22.351
That's right. You have
to avenge Dai, don't you?

00:02:22.384 --> 00:02:26.727
He's gone because he tried
to rescue you, after all.

00:02:28.463 --> 00:02:30.234
Popp [thought]: He's right.

00:02:30.267 --> 00:02:33.072
Dai came all this
way to protect me.

00:02:33.106 --> 00:02:35.511
All because of
my recklessness.

00:02:35.544 --> 00:02:38.383
If I lose now,
fighting this guy,

00:02:38.417 --> 00:02:40.788
then who's going
to rescue him?

00:02:43.326 --> 00:02:45.565
Matoriv: The Mage must
always be the most focused

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:48.336
and level-headed
member of their party.

00:02:51.075 --> 00:02:52.812
Popp [thought]:
I remember, Mentor...

00:02:52.846 --> 00:02:58.222
But... what can I do with the
little Magic Power I have left?

00:02:58.256 --> 00:03:01.328
The best thing I can do
for Dai right now, is...

00:03:01.362 --> 00:03:03.367
Killvearn: Come
on now, little Mage.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.470
Show me what you're made of.

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:08.744
Hey!

00:03:09.913 --> 00:03:12.083
Popp [thought]: All I can
do is run as far as I can...

00:03:12.117 --> 00:03:14.421
and let everyone
know what happened.

00:03:15.591 --> 00:03:17.629
Killvearn: A wise
choice, I guess.

00:03:17.662 --> 00:03:21.268
I thought a little provoking
would get him to lose his cool.

00:03:30.522 --> 00:03:31.422
No!

00:03:43.948 --> 00:03:44.983
Killvearn: Got you!

00:03:50.026 --> 00:03:51.597
Popp: Crocodine!

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.667
Killvearn: Oh, interesting.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.341
Another member of the
Hero's party that can fly.

00:03:57.374 --> 00:03:59.245
Piroro: The Beast King's here!

00:03:59.278 --> 00:04:01.182
Killvearn: Indeed he is.

00:04:01.215 --> 00:04:04.889
Crocodine: Beast
King Redemption Blast!

00:04:15.243 --> 00:04:17.014
Killvearn: You've
got to be kidding me.

00:04:17.047 --> 00:04:21.322
The brave Breast King
Crocodine just up and ran away?

00:04:21.356 --> 00:04:25.264
I've never let a target
escape me twice before.

00:04:25.297 --> 00:04:29.438
That boy is beginning
to irritate me.

00:04:36.787 --> 00:04:37.655
Popp: Crocodine...

00:04:37.688 --> 00:04:39.391
Are you okay?

00:04:39.424 --> 00:04:43.099
Popp: I... I...

00:04:43.133 --> 00:04:46.573
I didn't want to
abandon Dai and run.

00:04:46.606 --> 00:04:51.348
But... there was
nothing else I could do.

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:54.422
I didn't have a choice!

00:04:54.455 --> 00:04:55.758
Crocodine: I know.

00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:01.302
You wouldn't have run away-

00:05:01.335 --> 00:05:04.576
unless the situation
you were faced with...

00:05:04.609 --> 00:05:09.418
Was truly dire.
So then I ran, as well.

00:05:10.287 --> 00:05:13.560
I know the sort
of man that you are.

00:05:17.903 --> 00:05:20.542
[sobbing]

00:05:20.575 --> 00:05:23.246
We should return to Papnica.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.991
[sobbing]

00:05:45.157 --> 00:05:46.860
Mystvearn: Is it done?

00:05:47.796 --> 00:05:50.367
Hadlar: No. I doubt
he's unharmed,

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.237
but my Ultra
Combustion Slash

00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:55.778
didn't succeed
in finding its mark.

00:05:55.811 --> 00:05:58.416
Dai focused all
of his remaining power

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:00.554
into some kind
of counterattack,

00:06:00.588 --> 00:06:02.057
and managed to
defend himself from

00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:05.263
what should have been
a fatal blow by my hand.

00:06:05.297 --> 00:06:07.401
The boy has
remarkable instincts,

00:06:07.434 --> 00:06:09.672
and an unyielding
will to fight!

00:06:09.706 --> 00:06:11.676
The only explanation
would be that

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.479
there's a millenia's
worth of battle

00:06:13.514 --> 00:06:17.420
infused into the blood
of the Dragon Knights.

00:06:17.454 --> 00:06:21.095
And the attack he used
was none other than...

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:22.899
Gigabreak.

00:06:22.932 --> 00:06:25.971
He had clearly
never used it before,

00:06:26.005 --> 00:06:27.842
and its power was weak...

00:06:27.875 --> 00:06:30.347
but there's no
mistaking that it was

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.752
the attack of General Baran.

00:06:33.754 --> 00:06:37.027
Hadlar: Dai may say
he rejects his father,

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.898
but it appears Baran's shadow

00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:42.973
holds a great influence
over him even still.

00:06:43.006 --> 00:06:45.143
Like father like son.

00:06:45.176 --> 00:06:47.281
[chuckling]

00:06:47.314 --> 00:06:49.953
It's not over yet, Hero.

00:06:49.987 --> 00:06:51.022
Otherwise,

00:06:51.055 --> 00:06:54.796
I may question why I
bothered becoming a monster.

00:06:56.398 --> 00:06:58.971
Chiu: You idiot!
You hopeless fool!

00:06:59.004 --> 00:07:00.541
Stop it, Chiu!

00:07:00.574 --> 00:07:03.513
Come here!
You spineless coward!

00:07:05.818 --> 00:07:07.922
Chiu: You know, I was
actually beginning to think

00:07:07.955 --> 00:07:10.795
that maybe you weren't
such a bad guy after all-

00:07:10.828 --> 00:07:12.699
And then you had to
do something reckless

00:07:12.732 --> 00:07:14.970
and put Dai in
danger in the process!

00:07:15.003 --> 00:07:18.142
You call yourself
a friend of the Hero?!

00:07:18.844 --> 00:07:21.482
I'm sorry, Chiu.

00:07:22.518 --> 00:07:23.520
Popp: I know...

00:07:23.553 --> 00:07:26.660
There's no excuse
for what I did.

00:07:26.693 --> 00:07:28.797
This is all my fault.

00:07:31.904 --> 00:07:34.510
Chiu: Apologizing
won't fix anything!

00:07:34.543 --> 00:07:36.278
Hyunckel: Chiu, was it?

00:07:36.312 --> 00:07:37.848
Try to forgive him.

00:07:38.584 --> 00:07:39.919
Maam: Hyunckel...

00:07:39.953 --> 00:07:41.455
It's not his fault.

00:07:41.489 --> 00:07:43.894
He did what he thought
was right in the moment.

00:07:43.928 --> 00:07:46.198
And I don't think you
can imagine the guilt...

00:07:46.232 --> 00:07:48.537
he's already dealing with.

00:07:49.438 --> 00:07:51.543
Popp. Go get yourself
patched up...

00:07:51.577 --> 00:07:53.747
then maybe get some rest.

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:57.487
Hey - don't talk
to me like I'm a kid!

00:07:57.522 --> 00:07:59.759
I would rather take the
worst beating of my life

00:07:59.792 --> 00:08:02.097
than listen to your sympathy!

00:08:02.131 --> 00:08:05.605
Hyunckel: Crocodine, you'll
have to search for Dai.

00:08:05.638 --> 00:08:07.909
Right. I've got it covered.

00:08:07.942 --> 00:08:08.944
Popp: What?

00:08:08.977 --> 00:08:11.148
Leona: He probably
fell in the ocean somewhere

00:08:11.182 --> 00:08:13.286
northwest of Orzam.

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:14.254
You must hurry.

00:08:14.288 --> 00:08:15.490
Popp: Hey!

00:08:15.524 --> 00:08:17.294
Dai's no normal boy.
I'm certain that he lives.

00:08:17.328 --> 00:08:21.168
Hey, you there. Rat.

00:08:21.202 --> 00:08:23.807
Crocodine: I've got room
for someone your size.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.978
Can you make yourself useful?

00:08:26.012 --> 00:08:28.684
Of course! How wise
of you to ask.

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:30.954
Hey - wait! Let me come, too!

00:08:32.057 --> 00:08:35.029
Where we're going
it'll take a bit of courage!

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:36.900
Popp: Who does he-

00:08:37.467 --> 00:08:38.871
It's not fair!

00:08:38.904 --> 00:08:41.643
You can't search
if you can't fly.

00:08:41.676 --> 00:08:45.483
And I doubt you have the
Magic Power right now to do so.

00:08:45.518 --> 00:08:47.354
Are you kidding me?!

00:08:47.387 --> 00:08:49.391
I can't just leave
this to them-

00:08:49.425 --> 00:08:51.362
Dai's lost because of me.

00:08:51.395 --> 00:08:52.732
P-Princess, please...

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:54.101
Is there something I can do...

00:08:54.134 --> 00:08:55.972
You've got to know
some kind of spell

00:08:56.005 --> 00:08:58.643
that can restore
my Magic Power, right?!

00:08:58.677 --> 00:09:01.449
I've never heard
of such a spell.

00:09:01.482 --> 00:09:02.918
Oh, maybe...

00:09:02.952 --> 00:09:05.658
Lady Amy - didn't I give
you and the other Troika

00:09:05.691 --> 00:09:08.496
an item with the ability
to do something like that?

00:09:08.531 --> 00:09:11.903
Amy: Yes, Your Highness.
I believe Marin has it.

00:09:11.937 --> 00:09:13.105
That's it!

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:16.947
Somebody's all fired up.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.252
You talked to him
like that on purpose,

00:09:19.285 --> 00:09:20.487
am I right, Hyunckel?

00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:22.792
I had a feeling it'd
be a bit more effective

00:09:22.826 --> 00:09:24.929
than yelling at
him for a while.

00:09:24.963 --> 00:09:29.305
Healing from wounds inflicted
by a Dark Aura takes time.

00:09:29.338 --> 00:09:30.841
While I'm stuck in bed,

00:09:30.874 --> 00:09:33.814
I need him out there
working to get better.

00:09:33.847 --> 00:09:36.653
I need him on his feet.

00:09:37.888 --> 00:09:39.559
Dealing with Popp
is kind of like

00:09:39.592 --> 00:09:41.597
dealing with a pet,
or something, isn't it?

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.399
He's not the most reliable.

00:09:43.432 --> 00:09:45.236
[chuckling]

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:46.105
-Popp: Please!
-Marin: Stop!

00:09:46.138 --> 00:09:47.709
-Marin...
-Fine. You can have some!

00:09:47.742 --> 00:09:49.612
-I'm begging you please!
-Okay? Now let go!

00:09:49.646 --> 00:09:52.317
-Popp: Come on! You have to...
-I said yes. Let go!

00:09:53.019 --> 00:09:53.419
Huh?

00:09:53.452 --> 00:09:55.022
[furious shriek]

00:10:02.605 --> 00:10:04.141
Well, looks like he's coming.

00:10:04.174 --> 00:10:04.576
[proud chuckle]

00:10:04.609 --> 00:10:05.578
You bet he is.

00:10:05.611 --> 00:10:06.980
He's worried that
with me around

00:10:07.014 --> 00:10:09.685
there won't be any room
in the party for him.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.691
[chuckling]

00:10:12.725 --> 00:10:14.094
Popp [thought]:
Hold on, Dai.

00:10:14.127 --> 00:10:17.701
I promise - I'm going
to rescue you.

00:10:19.104 --> 00:10:21.643
Leona: Are you sure
that's a good idea?

00:10:21.676 --> 00:10:24.081
Once we're certain
that Dai is safe,

00:10:24.114 --> 00:10:28.189
it's time to invade the Dark
Army's stronghold to the north.

00:10:28.222 --> 00:10:29.357
But...

00:10:29.391 --> 00:10:32.932
Hyunckel: With the Sovereign
Rock Castle destroyed...

00:10:32.965 --> 00:10:35.537
There's only three
things in our way.

00:10:35.571 --> 00:10:39.879
Hadlar, Mystvearn,
and Killvearn the Reaper.

00:10:39.912 --> 00:10:42.918
The battle with King
Vearn is drawing near.

00:10:57.815 --> 00:10:59.117
Leona: Right here.

00:10:59.151 --> 00:11:01.154
We can assume that
the Dark King's base

00:11:01.188 --> 00:11:03.727
is somewhere in
the Field of Death.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.333
King Volken: Everyone,
what is our course of action?

00:11:08.637 --> 00:11:10.841
I agree with the
Disciples of Avan.

00:11:10.874 --> 00:11:14.381
We should invade as
soon as we are able to.

00:11:14.415 --> 00:11:17.655
But what do you think we could
achieve with a direct offensive?

00:11:17.688 --> 00:11:20.059
I doubt that we can
defeat all of them.

00:11:20.093 --> 00:11:22.731
But if we can take down even
one of their commanders,

00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:25.036
it will bring us that
much closer to stopping

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:27.975
the Dark King Vearn
once and for all.

00:11:31.114 --> 00:11:32.351
Very well, then.

00:11:32.384 --> 00:11:33.687
The day has come for us

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.192
to unite all of the
human kingdoms at last.

00:11:36.225 --> 00:11:39.230
What say you to that,
my fellow leaders?

00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:41.703
Yes.

00:11:41.736 --> 00:11:44.375
King Romos: King
Bengarna, do you object?

00:11:44.408 --> 00:11:47.515
I have no objections
to a direct attack, but...

00:11:47.548 --> 00:11:51.455
I do believe we'd need that
boy if we are to succeed.

00:11:51.488 --> 00:11:53.828
Do you mean Dai, Your Grace?

00:11:53.861 --> 00:11:55.029
King Bengarna: That's right.

00:11:55.063 --> 00:11:57.869
I've been focused
on weapons and arms,

00:11:57.902 --> 00:12:01.209
but when I saw
him wield that blade,

00:12:01.242 --> 00:12:03.814
I was honestly in awe.

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:06.218
Heroes truly are powerful.

00:12:06.252 --> 00:12:09.090
I must say my heart was truly
pounding the entire time.

00:12:09.124 --> 00:12:11.930
I'm amazed to see you
admit it, your Majesty,

00:12:11.963 --> 00:12:14.936
you were as giddy as
a little boy back there.

00:12:16.339 --> 00:12:20.013
Princess Leona, if he is
indeed successfully rescued,

00:12:20.046 --> 00:12:22.451
I promise to help
however I can.

00:12:22.484 --> 00:12:23.987
I know they'll find him.

00:12:24.021 --> 00:12:26.660
Dai's friends are conducting
a full-on search effort

00:12:26.693 --> 00:12:28.931
in the northern
ocean even as we speak.

00:12:28.964 --> 00:12:32.605
Isn't that a little close
to the enemy stronghold?

00:12:32.638 --> 00:12:34.241
King Teran:
If memory serves,

00:12:34.275 --> 00:12:36.580
the Field of Death
is a dreadful place

00:12:36.613 --> 00:12:38.850
that even wild
animals won't approach.

00:12:38.884 --> 00:12:40.787
Perhaps it's because
they can sense

00:12:40.821 --> 00:12:43.459
the Dark King's
evil presence there.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.671
Leona [thought]:
Please be okay, Dai.

00:12:48.704 --> 00:12:52.043
Popp: I'm not giving up
until I find you.

00:12:54.081 --> 00:12:56.519
This might take us a while.

00:12:58.857 --> 00:13:02.865
Hadlar: So, it's time
to face King Vearn.

00:13:02.899 --> 00:13:07.240
But Mystvearn, I never
confirmed the boy's defeat.

00:13:07.273 --> 00:13:11.382
In actual fact, I'm almost
certain he's still alive.

00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:14.154
I haven't wiped out
the Hero or his friends-

00:13:14.187 --> 00:13:17.027
despite my orders, I could
not keep my promise.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.366
It would be right to say
that I've failed our king.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.643
It's possible that I'll
be executed on the spot.

00:13:24.676 --> 00:13:27.247
That's why I'll say it now.

00:13:27.281 --> 00:13:31.556
I used to shun you for
your mysterious nature,

00:13:31.589 --> 00:13:34.929
but now I'm grateful to you.

00:13:36.031 --> 00:13:39.772
Of all the six
Legion Commanders,

00:13:39.806 --> 00:13:44.114
it's possible that you
were the most sincere.

00:13:44.147 --> 00:13:47.186
Underneath that mask
of silence you wear,

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.894
I can't help but
sense a fiery soul.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.267
Mystvearn: Hadlar...

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:58.409
Hadlar: I can now face my
end with my head held high.

00:13:58.443 --> 00:13:59.912
Thank you.

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:05.591
Killvearn: Oh,
don't be so dramatic.

00:14:05.624 --> 00:14:08.095
Your power has grown immense-

00:14:08.129 --> 00:14:10.433
he's sure to be impressed.

00:14:10.466 --> 00:14:12.170
It'll be anticlimactic,

00:14:12.203 --> 00:14:14.942
but he'll commend
you and that'll be it.

00:14:14.976 --> 00:14:16.646
Zaboera: He'll commend us?

00:14:16.679 --> 00:14:22.624
Well, his transformation was
thanks to my research after all.

00:14:22.658 --> 00:14:25.296
Zaboera: Huh?!
What about me?

00:14:28.402 --> 00:14:32.009
Hadlar: King Vearn,
I await your sentence.

00:14:47.709 --> 00:14:49.177
-Oh!
Killvearn: Uh-oh.

00:14:50.013 --> 00:14:53.119
Vearn: At ease, you two.

00:14:53.152 --> 00:14:57.962
Today, my heart feels
bright and clear.

00:14:57.995 --> 00:15:04.909
Like the sun shining
through the clouds above.

00:15:04.943 --> 00:15:08.315
My face has never been
seen by anyone but you two.

00:15:08.349 --> 00:15:12.123
But, I believe revealing
it to Hadlar is the best way

00:15:12.156 --> 00:15:18.904
to express my sincere approval
of his ongoing efforts.

00:15:18.937 --> 00:15:21.241
Vearn: What is wrong?

00:15:21.275 --> 00:15:25.885
Does this ancient,
haggard face surprise you?

00:15:25.918 --> 00:15:27.855
Are y-you...

00:15:27.889 --> 00:15:31.729
Indeed. I am Vearn.

00:15:35.203 --> 00:15:39.210
The Dark one... King Vearn.

00:15:50.567 --> 00:15:52.304
Hadlar [thought]:
Is this truly the man

00:15:52.337 --> 00:15:55.342
that I've feared
for all these years?!

00:15:55.376 --> 00:15:58.349
There is an immense
pressure to him.

00:15:58.382 --> 00:16:01.656
There's no mistaking that
it is the same presence

00:16:01.689 --> 00:16:04.227
I felt through that thin veil.

00:16:06.097 --> 00:16:08.604
But he's so incredibly old...

00:16:08.637 --> 00:16:09.471
Does he really possess

00:16:09.505 --> 00:16:12.110
the power of a god
of the Underworld?

00:16:12.144 --> 00:16:16.318
That frail neck...
Now, as a Superior Being,

00:16:16.352 --> 00:16:19.725
it would be nothing
for me to snap it!

00:16:20.827 --> 00:16:23.465
Would you care
to try it, Hadlar?

00:16:23.498 --> 00:16:24.768
[shocked gasp]

00:16:26.205 --> 00:16:28.175
My King, forgive me.

00:16:28.977 --> 00:16:30.246
Fear not.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.488
I've always liked that about
you, my Darkling friend.

00:16:34.522 --> 00:16:37.695
That boundless spirit,
and a heart which

00:16:37.728 --> 00:16:42.470
believes only in the power
that strength brings.

00:16:42.504 --> 00:16:47.113
Your recent behavior has
been rather uncharacteristic.

00:16:47.147 --> 00:16:53.459
Seeing that spirit rekindled
within you puts me at ease.

00:16:53.492 --> 00:16:56.265
Hadlar [thought]: I'm a fool
for thinking I could beat him.

00:16:56.298 --> 00:16:58.836
He is truly worlds beyond me.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:03.479
Vearn: As I had hoped, you've
broken free of your shell.

00:17:03.514 --> 00:17:08.155
Your power is now almost
in league with my own.

00:17:08.188 --> 00:17:12.496
I hereby rescind
my previous order.

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:17.207
Vearn: I would like you to
continue your duties by my side,

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.912
for the foreseeable future.

00:17:19.945 --> 00:17:23.018
Hadlar: If I may speak,
my Dark King.

00:17:23.052 --> 00:17:25.356
Understand that it
pains me to say this

00:17:25.389 --> 00:17:27.928
after you have granted
me such mercy...

00:17:27.961 --> 00:17:31.168
but there is something that
I still wish to accomplish...

00:17:31.201 --> 00:17:34.407
before I am reinstated
as Dark Commander.

00:17:34.976 --> 00:17:37.146
Do you mean the Hero?

00:17:37.179 --> 00:17:40.520
Yes. I wish to destroy
Dai and Avan's disciples-

00:17:40.554 --> 00:17:43.259
even if it were to
truly mean the end of me.

00:17:43.292 --> 00:17:46.532
That is my one final
request, Your Majesty.

00:17:46.566 --> 00:17:50.540
It is the only
desire I have left.

00:17:50.941 --> 00:17:52.978
[chuckling]

00:17:53.012 --> 00:17:56.085
There's no need for
such formalities.

00:17:56.118 --> 00:17:57.320
The Hero and his allies

00:17:57.354 --> 00:18:00.426
are still the largest
threat to my dark army.

00:18:00.459 --> 00:18:02.463
What objection
could I possibly have

00:18:02.497 --> 00:18:05.537
to their defeat
at your hand?

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:09.410
The Six Legions have fallen from
what they once were, I see.

00:18:09.444 --> 00:18:11.314
It seems unnecessary
to have someone

00:18:11.348 --> 00:18:13.653
of your stature
commanding them.

00:18:13.687 --> 00:18:17.160
So, Mystvearn; you
will take his place.

00:18:17.193 --> 00:18:18.462
Mystvearn: Yes, sire.

00:18:18.496 --> 00:18:21.334
Vearn: Hadlar, you will
protect the Field of Death.

00:18:21.367 --> 00:18:23.973
Surely you cannot
object to that?

00:18:24.007 --> 00:18:25.410
If Dai has survived,

00:18:25.443 --> 00:18:27.514
then it is only a
matter of time before

00:18:27.548 --> 00:18:30.152
he and his friends
attack this place...

00:18:30.185 --> 00:18:32.959
Thinking that
they can end this.

00:18:32.992 --> 00:18:35.897
My king... I shall obey you.

00:18:35.931 --> 00:18:39.438
Killvearn: And what would you
have me do, your eminence?

00:18:39.471 --> 00:18:42.143
Vearn: You will maintain
your current role.

00:18:42.176 --> 00:18:43.980
Killvearn: Very good, sire.

00:18:44.013 --> 00:18:45.316
[evil chuckle]

00:18:45.349 --> 00:18:48.488
I suppose the Reaper's
scythe must be kept swinging.

00:18:49.658 --> 00:18:50.661
What was that?!

00:18:50.694 --> 00:18:53.465
Why haven't they mentioned
anything about me?!

00:18:55.335 --> 00:18:56.806
Zaboera: My
Mystic Legion and I

00:18:56.839 --> 00:18:59.143
are still in
fighting shape...

00:18:59.177 --> 00:19:01.917
And they're all acting
like the great Zaboera

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:04.387
doesn't even exist anymore!

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:07.794
Why did I bother
sucking up to Hadlar and

00:19:07.828 --> 00:19:11.535
the other Legion Commanders
if this was to be my prize?!

00:19:11.569 --> 00:19:14.208
I have to do something
to distinguish myself

00:19:14.241 --> 00:19:16.946
to make King Vearn
finally acknowledge me!

00:19:16.979 --> 00:19:19.283
And to do that...

00:19:27.868 --> 00:19:30.774
Dai [thought]: What...
what happened to me?

00:19:31.509 --> 00:19:32.677
Where am I?

00:19:33.747 --> 00:19:35.584
In the ice?

00:19:35.617 --> 00:19:41.394
I can't move.
My wounds haven't healed.

00:19:42.463 --> 00:19:45.335
How did I survive like this?

00:19:49.712 --> 00:19:53.853
I see. You protected me.

00:19:53.887 --> 00:19:58.863
It's warm. You kept me from
being frozen in the ice.

00:20:00.701 --> 00:20:01.803
[gasp]

00:20:01.836 --> 00:20:03.205
A crack!

00:20:03.238 --> 00:20:06.045
Did Hadlar's attack cause that?

00:20:06.078 --> 00:20:09.384
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

00:20:09.417 --> 00:20:12.625
You've taken damage
that was meant for me.

00:20:12.658 --> 00:20:15.597
And you've been
protecting me all this time.

00:20:18.035 --> 00:20:20.272
I have to get out of here!

00:20:23.245 --> 00:20:25.416
Vearn: So tell me,
would you like to have

00:20:25.449 --> 00:20:28.623
some more servants
at your disposal?

00:20:28.657 --> 00:20:29.559
Huh?

00:20:29.592 --> 00:20:33.432
Vearn: The game of
chess is quite profound.

00:20:33.465 --> 00:20:36.204
It is often thought to
be a human game, you see,

00:20:36.238 --> 00:20:38.876
but in actual fact it
was originally invented

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:42.317
eons ago by the
gods themselves.

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:45.422
The beauty of chess
is in efficiently using

00:20:45.456 --> 00:20:48.296
the five types of pieces
with differing abilities

00:20:48.329 --> 00:20:50.633
to protect the one king.

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:54.542
The pawn moves forward
to defeat its enemies.

00:20:54.575 --> 00:20:58.784
The knight leaps eight ways,
striking from above.

00:20:58.817 --> 00:21:03.125
The rook charges
horizontally or vertically

00:21:03.158 --> 00:21:05.664
to decimate its foes.

00:21:05.697 --> 00:21:12.243
The bishop glides
diagonally like a phantom...

00:21:12.276 --> 00:21:13.445
And finally,

00:21:13.479 --> 00:21:16.251
possessing the abilities
of both rook and bishop,

00:21:16.285 --> 00:21:20.359
the queen is the
most powerful piece.

00:21:21.629 --> 00:21:24.033
That sound. Is it actually...

00:21:24.067 --> 00:21:25.938
Are those pieces
made out of...

00:21:25.971 --> 00:21:27.641
Orichalcum?!

00:21:27.674 --> 00:21:32.316
That they are.
How very observant of you.

00:21:33.418 --> 00:21:36.024
Vearn: You can
have those five pieces.

00:21:36.058 --> 00:21:40.065
I haven't had anyone to play
with in a long time anyways.

00:21:40.099 --> 00:21:44.307
If you use the Forbidden Magic
you created Flazzard with,

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.411
and transform them
into the ultimate force

00:21:46.445 --> 00:21:48.750
that serves you
as their king...

00:21:48.783 --> 00:21:53.559
Wouldn't that make for
an interesting game, hmm?

00:21:54.027 --> 00:21:56.064
[screeching]

00:21:57.433 --> 00:22:00.239
He's around here.
I'm sure of it.

00:22:00.273 --> 00:22:03.779
I know that Dai's nearby.

00:23:37.801 --> 00:23:40.607
Narrator: Popp's party scours
the frigid seas for Dai,

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.143
but Zaboera interferes,

00:23:42.176 --> 00:23:45.650
possessed with the desire to
gain his master's recognition.

00:23:46.318 --> 00:23:47.654
When the two sides clash,

00:23:47.687 --> 00:23:51.328
the Mystic Bishop unleashes
a terrifying Super Spell.

00:23:51.361 --> 00:23:54.668
And as the battle within the
glacier reaches its crescendo,

00:23:54.702 --> 00:23:57.307
a mysterious shining
warrior appears.

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:58.643
Don't miss

00:23:58.676 --> 00:24:01.047
