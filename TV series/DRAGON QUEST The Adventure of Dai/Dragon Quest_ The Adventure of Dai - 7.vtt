00:01:52.091 --> 00:01:53.459
Dai, get up!

00:01:54.963 --> 00:01:57.267
I think he must've
been paralyzed!

00:02:01.644 --> 00:02:03.146
No, stop!

00:02:07.455 --> 00:02:09.592
Popp: Dai!

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:12.398
Why did you hit him?!

00:02:12.431 --> 00:02:14.602
Calm down. Just look.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.875
[confused breath]

00:02:18.844 --> 00:02:19.713
[confused grunt]

00:02:21.115 --> 00:02:22.451
Dai: I... I...

00:02:22.986 --> 00:02:24.723
I can move again!

00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:30.634
Curse you!

00:02:35.343 --> 00:02:37.516
How can this be?!

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.352
What did you just do to him?

00:02:39.385 --> 00:02:42.458
That was Tingle. It cures
numbness and paralysis.

00:02:42.491 --> 00:02:44.195
Maam: It's not an attack spell.

00:02:44.228 --> 00:02:45.497
I'm here to help.

00:02:50.541 --> 00:02:54.415
Your friends may have
interrupted us...

00:02:54.448 --> 00:02:57.889
But they've merely
delayed the inevitable.

00:02:59.526 --> 00:03:00.427
Dai!

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.799
Hey - what kind of
weapon is that, anyway?

00:03:02.832 --> 00:03:03.801
I know.

00:03:03.834 --> 00:03:05.137
Can you cast a Crack spell?

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.206
Sure!

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.742
My Ice-type spells are
unparalleled.

00:03:07.775 --> 00:03:08.544
Nobody can beat-

00:03:08.577 --> 00:03:10.981
Maam: Forget the
bragging! Load it!

00:03:11.015 --> 00:03:12.785
Popp: Right!
Uh... How do I do that?

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.925
Maam: Press the button on the
top and then cast your spell.

00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:16.961
Hurry!

00:03:16.994 --> 00:03:18.262
All right...

00:03:20.535 --> 00:03:21.636
Crackle!

00:03:32.625 --> 00:03:34.529
Perish!

00:03:34.563 --> 00:03:35.430
Maam: Now.

00:03:39.806 --> 00:03:41.442
[frustrated roar]

00:03:43.013 --> 00:03:44.616
[roaring]

00:03:45.384 --> 00:03:47.287
Crocodine: The sun's rising?

00:03:47.822 --> 00:03:49.993
[pained roar]

00:03:50.026 --> 00:03:51.697
You're done.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.267
[furious growl]

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.137
You dare scar my face?

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.406
What's more...

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:00.114
You have scarred my
very pride along with it!

00:04:00.147 --> 00:04:02.618
You remember this, Dai.

00:04:02.652 --> 00:04:07.595
I swear you'll pay for
this embarrassment I swear!

00:04:12.271 --> 00:04:13.808
[confused breath]

00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:15.778
Dai! Are you okay?

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.351
Dai: Popp, how could you
ditch me back there?

00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:21.121
Popp: Whoa - wait!
I can explain!

00:04:21.155 --> 00:04:23.594
Maam: So you really
did abandon him!

00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:29.038
This is my Magic Bullet Gun.

00:04:29.071 --> 00:04:31.409
It was a gift from
Master Avan.

00:04:31.442 --> 00:04:33.413
You load spells
into the bullets,

00:04:33.447 --> 00:04:34.916
then anyone can fire them.

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:38.389
Popp: Wait - so, it can shoot
attacks and healing spells?

00:04:38.422 --> 00:04:41.864
Oh, so you're one of Master
Avan's students too, huh?

00:04:41.897 --> 00:04:43.266
That explains your strength.

00:04:43.299 --> 00:04:44.301
How do you feel?

00:04:44.335 --> 00:04:46.272
Dai: Good as new. Thanks!

00:04:46.305 --> 00:04:48.844
Your Midheal is better
than my Grampa's.

00:04:48.877 --> 00:04:52.317
Hey, could I get one of
those healing spells, too?

00:04:52.986 --> 00:04:54.188
Maam: Try some herbs.

00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:55.257
Popp: Come on!

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.660
What's with the
difference in treatment?

00:04:56.693 --> 00:04:59.465
It's the difference between
a Hero and a coward.

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:01.736
Popp: W-What?! Who are
you calling a coward?!

00:05:03.173 --> 00:05:06.847
Brass: These clouds
bode ill tidings.

00:05:06.881 --> 00:05:09.919
I hope nothing's happened
to Dai out there.

00:05:10.788 --> 00:05:12.357
Zaboera: [chuckle]

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.059
[noticing grunt]

00:05:13.092 --> 00:05:14.362
What's this?

00:05:14.395 --> 00:05:17.167
I sense a terrible presence.

00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:18.436
Zaboera: [giggling]

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:22.110
Zaboera: Well, you must
be Brass, the Lump Shaman.

00:05:22.143 --> 00:05:23.948
The Dark Army?

00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:25.450
It can't be.

00:05:25.483 --> 00:05:27.655
Brass: This island
is still protected

00:05:27.688 --> 00:05:31.062
by the Magic Circle
that Master Avan cast.

00:05:31.095 --> 00:05:34.936
Even when Hadlar breached it,
he caused a huge tremor.

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:38.911
So how could anyone
get through so easily?

00:05:38.945 --> 00:05:40.213
Zaboera: [chuckling]

00:05:40.246 --> 00:05:42.885
Zaboera: With Mystic
Magic Power like mine,

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.390
it was mere child's play.

00:05:47.327 --> 00:05:48.531
And who are you?

00:05:48.564 --> 00:05:52.137
I am the legendary
Mystic Bishop Zaboera

00:05:52.171 --> 00:05:56.245
Commander of one of the Dark
Lord's six glorious armies:

00:05:56.278 --> 00:05:58.250
The Mystic Legion.

00:05:58.283 --> 00:06:00.588
[trembling]

00:06:01.823 --> 00:06:03.226
[excited chirping]

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.130
Gomechan!

00:06:05.163 --> 00:06:06.265
-[joyous chirping]
-[laughing]

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:08.203
Mina: Maam! Are you okay?

00:06:08.236 --> 00:06:10.140
Boy: Of course she is, silly.

00:06:10.173 --> 00:06:12.979
Maam's so tough,
she's like a monster!

00:06:13.012 --> 00:06:14.281
Maam: A monster?

00:06:14.315 --> 00:06:16.853
Boy: I-I mean...
She's like a saint?

00:06:16.886 --> 00:06:17.822
Maam: 'Atta boy.

00:06:17.855 --> 00:06:18.890
[pleased squeak]

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:21.730
Elder: Maam, who are the boys?

00:06:21.763 --> 00:06:24.268
They're nobody
suspicious, Elder.

00:06:24.301 --> 00:06:27.140
These two are Heroes
fighting the Dark Army.

00:06:28.076 --> 00:06:28.844
They are?

00:06:28.877 --> 00:06:31.015
Hey, y'know,
come to think of it

00:06:31.048 --> 00:06:34.656
Gomechan was the only one on the
island who never went crazy.

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:36.458
So your name's Gomechan.

00:06:36.492 --> 00:06:38.462
I'm happy you
found your friends.

00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:40.534
Well, that's something...

00:06:40.568 --> 00:06:43.006
Maybe Gomechan has
some kind of power.

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:45.878
A power that blocks the Dark
Lord's influence on his mind.

00:06:45.911 --> 00:06:49.117
I'm just glad we're reunited.
Thank you so much, Maam.

00:06:49.151 --> 00:06:50.253
You're more than welcome.

00:06:50.286 --> 00:06:51.088
Leira: Hi, Maam.

00:06:55.397 --> 00:06:58.269
Hey Dai, Popp; this is
my mother, Leira.

00:06:58.302 --> 00:06:59.338
Popp: H-Hello.

00:06:59.371 --> 00:07:00.675
Oh, Mother,

00:07:00.708 --> 00:07:03.981
these two travelers are
Master Avan's students as well.

00:07:04.014 --> 00:07:06.620
Oh, Master Avan's?

00:07:06.653 --> 00:07:09.559
Wait a second.
You know our Master too?

00:07:09.593 --> 00:07:10.795
Maam: Of course she does.

00:07:10.828 --> 00:07:12.998
Avan's known
my family for ages.

00:07:13.032 --> 00:07:16.306
Mom and my late father fought
the Dark Lord by his side.

00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:17.642
Both: What?!

00:07:18.476 --> 00:07:20.647
It was a long time ago.

00:07:20.681 --> 00:07:24.321
My husband was a great Warrior
and I was a young Priest.

00:07:24.354 --> 00:07:27.528
Leira: Together,
we stood by Master Avan.

00:07:27.562 --> 00:07:29.332
After the Dark Lord
was vanquished

00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:31.336
and peace had been
restored to the land,

00:07:31.369 --> 00:07:33.874
he even came to visit
our village, once.

00:07:33.907 --> 00:07:36.212
And of course,
he stayed with us.

00:07:36.245 --> 00:07:38.183
That was when he tutored Maam.

00:07:38.216 --> 00:07:40.153
We were all so honored.

00:07:40.187 --> 00:07:43.661
Leira: That must have been...
oh, four or five years ago, now.

00:07:43.694 --> 00:07:46.432
Maam: Wow. It's already
been that long?

00:07:46.465 --> 00:07:49.371
Leira: So tell me;
is Master Avan keeping well?

00:07:49.404 --> 00:07:50.975
Huh?! Uh... He-

00:07:51.008 --> 00:07:52.244
Yeah! He's fine!

00:07:52.277 --> 00:07:54.415
Dai: And just
as lively as ever.

00:07:54.448 --> 00:07:55.552
Popp: Dai...

00:07:55.585 --> 00:07:59.659
Ah, I see. Well,
that's very good to hear.

00:07:59.693 --> 00:08:03.032
Y'know, maybe you two should
stay with us after all.

00:08:03.065 --> 00:08:06.438
Maam: I'd love to hear more
stories about Master Avan.

00:08:06.472 --> 00:08:08.510
We couldn't intrude.

00:08:08.544 --> 00:08:11.315
What a good idea.
Please, stay for a while.

00:08:11.348 --> 00:08:13.019
We should actually get going.

00:08:13.053 --> 00:08:14.623
C'mon. Stay with us!

00:08:14.656 --> 00:08:17.227
That way I get to play
with Gomechan again.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.797
I wanna play, too.

00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:20.199
Me too!

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:23.105
This village welcomes
any student of Master Avan.

00:08:25.376 --> 00:08:27.247
Maam: Most of
the men have gone off

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.385
to help protect Romos Castle.

00:08:29.418 --> 00:08:31.322
So the rest of us
all work together

00:08:31.355 --> 00:08:33.492
to defend the
village ourselves.

00:08:33.527 --> 00:08:35.898
And you're the one
leading the charge, right?

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:39.138
Well, my father was a Warrior
and my mother's a Priest,

00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:41.743
so I guess that makes
me a Warrior Priest.

00:08:41.776 --> 00:08:45.618
Maam: Master Avan taught me
Healing and Support-type spells,

00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:48.089
as well as some martial arts.

00:08:48.122 --> 00:08:52.064
But no matter what I try,
I can't use attack spells.

00:08:52.097 --> 00:08:54.636
So he gave you
the Magic Bullet Gun.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:58.710
That's right. It was
at my graduation.

00:08:58.744 --> 00:09:02.718
I'll never forget that
day as long as I live.

00:09:05.457 --> 00:09:06.627
What's this?

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.133
Your graduation pendant:
An Insignia of Avan.

00:09:10.166 --> 00:09:11.804
With this, anywhere you go,

00:09:11.837 --> 00:09:14.341
you're an official
protector of justice.

00:09:14.374 --> 00:09:15.578
[amazed breath]

00:09:15.611 --> 00:09:17.615
And this is a present from me.

00:09:17.648 --> 00:09:19.384
Why don't you see
what's inside?

00:09:19.417 --> 00:09:21.021
I get a present?

00:09:22.992 --> 00:09:24.362
[gasp]

00:09:24.395 --> 00:09:26.165
What is this, Master?

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:28.236
Don't be afraid.

00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:32.344
It is a great weapon that lets
you charge and fire magic...

00:09:32.378 --> 00:09:34.047
Avan: A Magic Bullet Gun.

00:09:34.081 --> 00:09:36.452
I made it based on
some of my research.

00:09:36.485 --> 00:09:37.120
Maam: Master...

00:09:37.154 --> 00:09:38.222
Huh?

00:09:38.256 --> 00:09:41.930
I... I'm sorry, but I don't
want this scary thing.

00:09:41.964 --> 00:09:45.571
I really just want to
be like my Mom and Dad,

00:09:45.605 --> 00:09:47.741
and to help them protect
everyone in the village

00:09:47.775 --> 00:09:50.581
from any trouble
that comes our way.

00:09:50.615 --> 00:09:52.217
That's all, Master.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:56.458
Avan: Maam, you truly
are a gentle soul.

00:09:56.492 --> 00:09:58.429
But just know this;

00:09:58.463 --> 00:10:01.803
there are times when
love and kindness

00:10:01.836 --> 00:10:05.611
aren't enough to
protect people alone.

00:10:05.645 --> 00:10:08.684
Avan: Just as strength
without justice is tyranny,

00:10:08.717 --> 00:10:11.556
justice without
strength is powerless.

00:10:11.589 --> 00:10:13.225
You understand?

00:10:15.196 --> 00:10:17.668
Avan: Besides, this
weapon was not designed

00:10:17.702 --> 00:10:19.538
only to boost your attack.

00:10:19.572 --> 00:10:21.441
It can also be
used to save people

00:10:21.475 --> 00:10:25.885
with Healing and
Support-type spells.

00:10:25.918 --> 00:10:28.489
It's all in how you use it.

00:10:28.523 --> 00:10:30.728
So don't worry.

00:10:30.761 --> 00:10:32.898
Avan: Because there's no
doubt in my mind.

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:37.373
In your hands, this will never
become power without justice.

00:10:38.544 --> 00:10:41.181
I guarantee it.
Just trust me.

00:10:42.317 --> 00:10:44.087
I'll do my best.

00:10:46.058 --> 00:10:49.866
Maam: He was a little silly,
but strong and kind.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.005
A truly wonderful teacher.

00:10:54.675 --> 00:10:58.249
Oh, man. I am really
missing him all of a sudden.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.123
Popp [thought]: At first
I thought she was obnoxious,

00:11:02.157 --> 00:11:05.263
but it doesn't seem
like that's true.

00:11:05.296 --> 00:11:08.235
In fact, now that
I've gotten to know her,

00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:11.843
Maam's actually, kinda...

00:11:24.802 --> 00:11:28.409
[furious roar]

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:32.852
Crocodine: Pathetic...

00:11:32.885 --> 00:11:37.493
Disciple of Avan or not,
I still let that child best me.

00:11:37.528 --> 00:11:39.331
Leave me!

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:42.538
Zaboera: I see you're in
a bad mood, Crocodine.

00:11:42.572 --> 00:11:43.807
Who has such nerve?!

00:11:43.841 --> 00:11:44.976
Zaboera: [devious chuckle]

00:11:45.009 --> 00:11:47.281
Zaboera: I suppose
I can't blame you.

00:11:47.314 --> 00:11:52.490
Not after a few mere children
managed to scar you so.

00:11:53.594 --> 00:11:55.096
Zaboera.

00:11:57.333 --> 00:12:00.073
Zaboera: Good to see
you again, Beast King.

00:12:00.106 --> 00:12:03.647
Do tell... How is it
you knew of my wound?

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.653
The Heyedra are watchers
of the battlefield,

00:12:06.686 --> 00:12:09.759
and they all belong
to my Mystic Legion.

00:12:09.792 --> 00:12:12.898
Zaboera: There is nothing
that I do not know.

00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:14.870
And...

00:12:14.903 --> 00:12:18.710
That's it? Have you
come to laugh at me?

00:12:18.743 --> 00:12:20.046
When I learned of your plight,

00:12:20.079 --> 00:12:23.419
I thought I'd
come and offer my aid.

00:12:23.452 --> 00:12:25.925
Are you offering aid to me?

00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.997
I am a fellow Legion
Commander, am I not?

00:12:32.303 --> 00:12:35.811
All right. I should probably
go see the village elder.

00:12:35.844 --> 00:12:37.013
What's wrong?

00:12:37.047 --> 00:12:38.784
I just need to ask him
to load these bullets

00:12:38.817 --> 00:12:40.287
with some attack spells.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.457
Maam: The elder is
the best spell caster

00:12:42.491 --> 00:12:44.160
out of everybody
in the village.

00:12:46.833 --> 00:12:50.273
You stay. I would be
happy to do it for you.

00:12:50.306 --> 00:12:51.876
Really? Thank you.

00:12:51.909 --> 00:12:53.614
Popp: Sure thing.
Leave it to me.

00:12:53.647 --> 00:12:55.349
Congratulations, Maam.

00:12:55.382 --> 00:12:58.790
You should know, Popp hardly
does anything for anyone.

00:12:58.823 --> 00:13:01.228
Hey! Back me up,
you little doofus!

00:13:01.261 --> 00:13:02.030
[amused laugh]

00:13:02.063 --> 00:13:03.767
Well, while you
take care of that,

00:13:03.801 --> 00:13:05.937
I'll go and see
about dinner.

00:13:11.616 --> 00:13:13.319
We can't tell her.

00:13:13.352 --> 00:13:15.758
If she learns
Master Avan's gone...

00:13:15.791 --> 00:13:17.393
I know.

00:13:17.427 --> 00:13:20.499
But he really was
amazing, wasn't he?

00:13:23.005 --> 00:13:26.078
There are so many people out
there who look up to him.

00:13:26.612 --> 00:13:27.748
Popp: Yeah...

00:13:27.781 --> 00:13:30.788
Well, I guess I
should fill these up.

00:13:30.822 --> 00:13:32.056
Dai: You know what?

00:13:33.092 --> 00:13:34.929
That's it. I gotta go.

00:13:34.962 --> 00:13:36.198
Popp: Huh? Where?

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:38.001
Dai? Hey!

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:40.908
What's his problem?

00:13:40.941 --> 00:13:42.344
Crocodine: Ridiculous!

00:13:42.377 --> 00:13:46.017
You would have me
use such a dirty tactic?

00:13:46.051 --> 00:13:49.959
Zaboera: There's no clean or
dirty in defeating an enemy.

00:13:49.993 --> 00:13:54.068
Crocodine: Be quiet! I don't
need your gutless help.

00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:57.341
I am going to fight
that brat fair and square,

00:13:57.374 --> 00:13:59.011
and this time, I'll win.

00:13:59.044 --> 00:14:00.714
Zaboera: Are you sure?

00:14:00.747 --> 00:14:04.688
This boy Dai is not
to be underestimated.

00:14:04.722 --> 00:14:09.164
And apparently, he even took off
the hands of Lord Hadlar.

00:14:09.197 --> 00:14:11.068
[gasp]

00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:12.972
Don't be so full of yourself.

00:14:13.005 --> 00:14:15.577
And besides, if you
should happen to fail,

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:19.418
I expect you'll also lose
your seat in the Dark Army.

00:14:19.451 --> 00:14:21.388
[amused chuckle]

00:14:21.422 --> 00:14:24.260
Zaboera: Lord Hadlar may
be aware of Dai's power,

00:14:24.294 --> 00:14:29.137
but what will the other four
Legion Commanders say? Huh?

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:32.912
"The Beast King Crocodine
turned out to be such a fool

00:14:32.945 --> 00:14:36.485
that he couldn't even take
out one measly child."

00:14:37.386 --> 00:14:38.957
How dare you.

00:14:40.326 --> 00:14:43.032
Try using this,
not your ego.

00:14:43.065 --> 00:14:45.002
It's for your own good.

00:14:45.036 --> 00:14:47.073
Zaboera: I'm sure you
wouldn't want to lose

00:14:47.106 --> 00:14:50.514
your current position,
now, would you?

00:14:52.083 --> 00:14:55.390
Zaboera: What's inside
will defeat the boy.

00:14:55.423 --> 00:14:57.360
Take it with you.

00:14:57.393 --> 00:14:58.530
[devious chuckle]

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:00.668
[humming]

00:15:00.701 --> 00:15:02.403
Dai: I have a favor to ask.

00:15:03.206 --> 00:15:04.441
Wait, Dai?

00:15:04.475 --> 00:15:07.313
Dai: Would you please
train me in magic, sir?

00:15:07.347 --> 00:15:10.286
I can't be running around saying
that I'm no good at spells

00:15:10.319 --> 00:15:13.025
while I'm fighting
the Dark Army.

00:15:13.059 --> 00:15:14.562
I don't understand.

00:15:14.596 --> 00:15:17.801
It is true that I'm the best
Mage in all of the village,

00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:19.338
but I don't think
I'm good enough

00:15:19.371 --> 00:15:22.911
to be teaching a
student of Master Avan.

00:15:22.945 --> 00:15:25.082
Maam [thought]:
Magic training?

00:15:25.884 --> 00:15:27.621
Dai: Well, that's the thing.

00:15:27.655 --> 00:15:30.928
I was only trained by
Master Avan for three days.

00:15:30.961 --> 00:15:32.999
What do you mean, young man?

00:15:33.032 --> 00:15:34.401
Well, Elder.

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:37.040
You have to promise not
to let Maam or her mother

00:15:37.073 --> 00:15:39.378
know about this, but...

00:15:39.411 --> 00:15:44.488
Dai: Master...
Master Avan... is gone.

00:15:44.522 --> 00:15:46.024
Elder: What?! How?

00:15:46.058 --> 00:15:49.264
Dai: He was protecting
us from the Dark Army.

00:15:49.297 --> 00:15:52.036
And that's why I
need to get stronger.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:54.274
So I can avenge my Master!

00:15:54.307 --> 00:15:57.413
Dai: I have to.
I'm a disciple of Avan.

00:16:01.823 --> 00:16:03.459
Leira: You can use this room.

00:16:03.492 --> 00:16:04.094
Dai: Great.

00:16:04.128 --> 00:16:05.430
Popp: Thank you very much.

00:16:05.463 --> 00:16:08.269
Maam shut herself in her room
as soon as she got home.

00:16:08.302 --> 00:16:10.439
Leira: I wonder what's wrong.

00:16:11.876 --> 00:16:15.249
Maam: I can't...
I can't believe...

00:16:16.018 --> 00:16:17.621
He's gone...

00:16:24.702 --> 00:16:26.305
Oh! Looking good, Dai!

00:16:26.338 --> 00:16:29.077
There you go.
Now cast it forth.

00:16:30.981 --> 00:16:32.484
Dai: Frizz!

00:16:32.518 --> 00:16:33.419
[frustrated grunt]

00:16:33.452 --> 00:16:35.356
Oh, come on!

00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:36.491
Hang on!

00:16:37.928 --> 00:16:38.997
Popp: What?!

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:40.166
Dai: I did it!

00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:42.671
I didn't know you could
throw the Fireball!

00:16:43.272 --> 00:16:44.976
Well done, young Hero!

00:16:45.009 --> 00:16:46.445
Dai: I really did it!

00:16:46.478 --> 00:16:51.322
I finally managed to do a spell,
and all on my own this time!

00:16:51.355 --> 00:16:53.058
What on earth does he mean?

00:16:53.092 --> 00:16:54.862
Popp: Well, sometimes
when he gets excited,

00:16:54.896 --> 00:16:56.700
this mark lights up
on his forehead.

00:16:56.733 --> 00:16:57.901
And when it does,

00:16:57.935 --> 00:17:00.908
he gets really strong and casts
all these amazing spells.

00:17:00.941 --> 00:17:04.047
But normally, he can't
use magic at all.

00:17:05.651 --> 00:17:07.119
Crack!

00:17:09.324 --> 00:17:10.727
[disappointed groans]

00:17:11.596 --> 00:17:14.233
He's a pretty big
weirdo, isn't he?

00:17:15.604 --> 00:17:18.276
Elder [thought]: A mark
on their forehead...

00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:19.344
A crest?

00:17:19.377 --> 00:17:21.650
I've heard of a class
of Ultimate Knights

00:17:21.683 --> 00:17:23.185
with something similar;

00:17:23.218 --> 00:17:27.861
ones who can use any spell
or fighting skill, but...

00:17:27.894 --> 00:17:29.532
He couldn't be.

00:17:29.565 --> 00:17:30.667
Dai: Frizz!

00:17:34.576 --> 00:17:35.844
Oh, yeah!

00:17:35.877 --> 00:17:39.284
I've forced some spells before,
but that was something else.

00:17:39.317 --> 00:17:42.123
And personally I don't
think I'd call it success.

00:17:42.157 --> 00:17:45.864
Now... It doesn't matter
how he hit his target.

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:48.670
He overcame weakness
with ingenuity.

00:17:48.703 --> 00:17:50.239
He's quite a clever lad.

00:17:50.272 --> 00:17:52.945
All right. Well,
I'd better stay sharp.

00:17:52.978 --> 00:17:54.447
My turn, Dai!

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:00.961
Maam: Oh? You're
leaving tomorrow?

00:18:00.995 --> 00:18:02.163
Dai: Yeah.

00:18:02.197 --> 00:18:04.133
Maam: You said you were
going to Romos Castle.

00:18:04.167 --> 00:18:05.203
What for?

00:18:05.236 --> 00:18:06.973
We're gonna help
the king and his army.

00:18:07.006 --> 00:18:08.375
We heard that they're
being threatened

00:18:08.409 --> 00:18:10.413
by all kinds of monsters.

00:18:10.446 --> 00:18:11.615
Maam: I see.

00:18:13.119 --> 00:18:15.356
Hey, does Maam seem
kinda down to you?

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:17.561
Yeah, listen Dai.
I've been thinking.

00:18:17.595 --> 00:18:19.699
Why don't we just
tell her the truth?

00:18:19.732 --> 00:18:21.536
Huh? No, we can't!

00:18:21.569 --> 00:18:25.811
Popp: She deserves to know, and
she might decide to join us.

00:18:25.844 --> 00:18:27.246
But she can't.

00:18:27.279 --> 00:18:30.754
Maam already has her duty
to protect this village.

00:18:30.787 --> 00:18:32.624
Yeah, even so...

00:18:32.657 --> 00:18:33.660
Dai: Oh, I see.

00:18:33.693 --> 00:18:34.729
Huh? See what?

00:18:34.762 --> 00:18:38.302
Come on. Just admit it.
You like Maam, don't you?

00:18:38.335 --> 00:18:41.207
W-W-What are you
talking about? No!

00:18:41.241 --> 00:18:43.513
And why should
I like her, anyway?

00:18:43.547 --> 00:18:45.984
Dai: Liar. You think
I don't notice?

00:18:46.017 --> 00:18:47.788
You're always staring at her.

00:18:47.821 --> 00:18:48.724
Popp: I am not!

00:18:48.757 --> 00:18:51.862
Forget it. I'm going to
sleep. Goodnight.

00:19:00.981 --> 00:19:03.553
[chatter]

00:19:04.354 --> 00:19:05.890
Mina: Bye-bye, Gomechan!

00:19:05.924 --> 00:19:06.893
[chirping]

00:19:06.926 --> 00:19:08.129
Elder: Good luck out there.

00:19:08.162 --> 00:19:09.263
Yeah.

00:19:12.403 --> 00:19:15.342
See you, Maam.
And thanks for everything.

00:19:15.375 --> 00:19:19.686
I'm sorry. I really wanted
to go with you guys, but...

00:19:19.719 --> 00:19:20.954
Oh, that's totally okay.

00:19:20.987 --> 00:19:24.127
This time the elder gave us
a map of the Dark Forest.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.564
Maam: Uh-huh.

00:19:25.597 --> 00:19:26.599
Dai: Goodbye!

00:19:26.632 --> 00:19:28.871
I promise to
come back sometime!

00:19:28.904 --> 00:19:30.807
And I'll come along too!

00:19:32.143 --> 00:19:33.880
Those two are good boys.

00:19:33.913 --> 00:19:37.186
So young, yet they're
standing up to the Dark Army.

00:19:37.219 --> 00:19:38.656
That's bravery.

00:19:40.026 --> 00:19:42.296
What's wrong, Maam?
You're crying.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:44.669
Maam [thought]: They're both
willing to risk their lives

00:19:44.702 --> 00:19:47.574
to avenge Master Avan,
and I'm just...

00:19:47.608 --> 00:19:51.281
I... I...

00:19:51.314 --> 00:19:53.485
Leira: Maam,
go after them.

00:19:54.788 --> 00:19:56.024
Maam: Mother?!

00:19:56.058 --> 00:20:00.432
I know you want to help them,
so I won't stand in your way.

00:20:00.466 --> 00:20:04.307
Leira: Go on. Don't worry
about us. We'll be just fine.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:05.677
But, what if...

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:11.288
Yes, I know. Don't forget,
I once left this village, too.

00:20:11.321 --> 00:20:13.659
After I saw your
father and Master Avan

00:20:13.693 --> 00:20:16.999
both fighting even when
they were wounded, I had to.

00:20:17.032 --> 00:20:19.572
Yes, yes. That's right, Leira.

00:20:19.605 --> 00:20:23.045
Leira: You're my daughter,
so it must be in your blood.

00:20:23.079 --> 00:20:24.748
But, I...

00:20:24.782 --> 00:20:26.552
You heard her, Maam.

00:20:26.586 --> 00:20:28.288
And don't you worry
about the village.

00:20:28.321 --> 00:20:31.194
I still have plenty
of strength in me yet.

00:20:31.227 --> 00:20:33.332
Yeah, that's right. Go ahead!

00:20:33.366 --> 00:20:36.205
It's fine. We can
protect the village.

00:20:36.238 --> 00:20:39.444
Make sure to take
good care of Gomechan!

00:20:40.346 --> 00:20:44.487
Maam: Of course.
Thanks everyone!

00:20:47.126 --> 00:20:48.763
Hold on, is it this way?

00:20:50.032 --> 00:20:51.168
Dai: Or this way?

00:20:51.201 --> 00:20:54.307
Oh, no. You're like
this even with a map?!

00:20:57.347 --> 00:20:59.685
Maam: Hey, Dai! Popp!

00:21:02.925 --> 00:21:03.392
Maam?!

00:21:03.425 --> 00:21:04.728
[amazed chirping]

00:21:04.762 --> 00:21:05.229
Huh?

00:21:05.262 --> 00:21:06.766
Wait up you guys!

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.235
I'm coming with you!

00:21:08.269 --> 00:21:09.204
[cheering]

00:21:09.237 --> 00:21:10.908
Someone who can read a map!

00:21:10.941 --> 00:21:11.776
[playful chuckle]

00:21:11.809 --> 00:21:13.713
Hey, good for you, Popp.

00:21:14.447 --> 00:21:15.851
What do you mean?!

00:21:15.884 --> 00:21:19.357
I was just saying I thought
she'd be useful to have around!

00:21:20.326 --> 00:21:21.729
Maam: All right, you two.

00:21:21.763 --> 00:21:24.969
If you're both disciples
of Avan, then so am I,

00:21:25.002 --> 00:21:27.373
and that makes me your senior.

00:21:27.407 --> 00:21:28.943
So, if he's gone...

00:21:28.977 --> 00:21:32.449
I'm going to carry on
his will and fight, too.

00:21:34.287 --> 00:21:35.256
Maam?

00:21:35.289 --> 00:21:37.493
So she knows. Did you...

00:21:39.665 --> 00:21:42.404
You can tell me on the walk
to Romos Castle, 'kay?

00:21:42.437 --> 00:21:44.473
Maam: And... it's this way!

00:21:46.211 --> 00:21:48.048
Come on. Hurry.

00:21:49.351 --> 00:21:52.658
I get the feeling she's
going to boss us around.

00:21:52.691 --> 00:21:55.697
Relax. That means
she's reliable.

00:21:57.267 --> 00:21:58.770
Dai: Come on, buddy.

00:21:58.803 --> 00:22:01.341
[excited chirp]

00:23:37.534 --> 00:23:39.739
Narrator: With the help
of their new companion Maam,

00:23:39.772 --> 00:23:42.309
Dai and Popp reach
the Romos Kingdom.

00:23:42.343 --> 00:23:44.648
But soon, a vengeful
Crocodine attacks,

00:23:44.681 --> 00:23:48.623
and uses his Furfang Legion
to coax Dai into another bout.

00:23:48.656 --> 00:23:50.693
Fighting to reclaim
his warrior's pride,

00:23:50.727 --> 00:23:53.365
the Beast King strikes
like a furious titan,

00:23:53.399 --> 00:23:56.605
and intends to hit Dai
right where it hurts.

00:23:56.639 --> 00:23:58.375
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:58.408 --> 00:24:01.048
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai:

00:24:01.081 --> 00:24:03.485
"Furfang Full Assault"
