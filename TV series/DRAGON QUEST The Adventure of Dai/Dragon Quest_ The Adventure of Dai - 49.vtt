WEBVTT

00:01:50.688 --> 00:01:51.556
Nova!

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.526
[laughing]

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:55.330
It seems the Hero has
learned his lesson.

00:01:56.032 --> 00:01:57.168
Here's one...

00:01:57.201 --> 00:01:59.071
last lesson.

00:01:59.104 --> 00:02:00.441
In this world...

00:02:00.474 --> 00:02:03.514
There's always
someone more powerful.

00:02:03.548 --> 00:02:04.583
And now...

00:02:04.616 --> 00:02:06.086
goodbye!

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.522
Nova!

00:02:07.555 --> 00:02:10.394
Time to perish... with glory!

00:02:10.427 --> 00:02:11.697
At last!

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:13.634
N-No!

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:17.709
[evil laughter]

00:02:24.823 --> 00:02:27.294
Hyunckel: You talk too much,
but you're right.

00:02:27.328 --> 00:02:30.702
There is always someone...

00:02:30.735 --> 00:02:32.739
Someone more powerful.

00:02:36.814 --> 00:02:38.216
Hyunckel!

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:44.294
[screeching]

00:02:45.264 --> 00:02:47.234
Popp: Maam! Crocodine!

00:02:51.777 --> 00:02:54.282
Crocodine: I do not take
you for granted, Garuda.

00:02:54.315 --> 00:02:57.320
Rest for now.
Get your strength back.

00:02:58.624 --> 00:02:59.392
They're stuck.

00:02:59.425 --> 00:03:00.326
Right!

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:05.638
Yow-ow-ow!

00:03:06.707 --> 00:03:09.679
Be a little more gentle
next time, Big Guy.

00:03:11.282 --> 00:03:14.021
We owe you one.
Now be careful.

00:03:14.055 --> 00:03:16.793
They're incredibly strong.

00:03:16.827 --> 00:03:20.734
Albinass: So, all the Disciples
of Avan are finally here.

00:03:20.768 --> 00:03:25.277
I suppose we shouldn't hold
ourselves back, anymore.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.880
Dai. You see?

00:03:30.186 --> 00:03:32.424
That attack should
have been fatal.

00:03:32.457 --> 00:03:36.366
Flazzard was created with
the same forbidden magic.

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:39.338
It's possible they
have the same weakness.

00:03:39.372 --> 00:03:41.577
That means if
we find their cores

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.581
and use our
Air techniques,

00:03:43.614 --> 00:03:45.952
these beings can be defeated.

00:03:45.985 --> 00:03:49.024
You're right. But how are
we going to find them?

00:03:49.058 --> 00:03:51.362
Hym: I'll spare
you the trouble.

00:03:51.395 --> 00:03:54.335
The same place as
yours; right here.

00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:56.841
Right where a human being
would have their heart.

00:03:56.874 --> 00:03:58.209
Is his brain cracked?

00:03:58.243 --> 00:04:00.380
He just revealed
their weakness!

00:04:00.414 --> 00:04:03.253
Simply knowing
that won't help you.

00:04:03.287 --> 00:04:04.556
Nothing in existence

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.196
has the strength to destroy
all five of our cores.

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:11.368
Speaking of which-
there's now five of you.

00:04:11.402 --> 00:04:13.473
We're perfectly
matched, aren't we?

00:04:13.507 --> 00:04:16.479
Here's a reward for
that successful attack.

00:04:17.816 --> 00:04:21.524
Behold; the true power
of Hadlar's Royal Guard!

00:04:21.557 --> 00:04:24.896
They're quite confident
in their powers, aren't they?

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.065
So what?!

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.702
After everything
we've been through,

00:04:27.735 --> 00:04:31.142
a team like ours can't lose to
some lame puppets like them!

00:04:31.176 --> 00:04:32.612
Hey, Maam;

00:04:32.646 --> 00:04:35.551
you try to take care of that guy
with the horse head, alright?

00:04:35.584 --> 00:04:38.557
If we can get rid of that
thing that deflects spells,

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.495
I can take them
all out with a Medroa.

00:04:42.297 --> 00:04:43.800
Sure thing.

00:04:47.108 --> 00:04:49.444
I'll take on the big one.

00:04:51.215 --> 00:04:53.353
Dai. Who's the one in charge?

00:04:53.386 --> 00:04:56.059
Without Hadlar around, she is.

00:04:56.092 --> 00:04:57.895
Don't underestimate her.

00:04:58.296 --> 00:04:59.331
All right.

00:05:00.935 --> 00:05:04.943
Allow me to return the favor
to that eldest one, Albinass.

00:05:04.977 --> 00:05:08.951
Not yet, Hym. The Hero
is your first priority.

00:05:08.985 --> 00:05:12.925
The Hero? So you want me
to ignore what Hyunckel did?

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:16.867
I will not be satisfied until
that traitor is paid in full.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.939
We are all Lord
Hadlar's pieces, right?

00:05:19.973 --> 00:05:23.815
We live and die for his
happiness, his glory.

00:05:23.848 --> 00:05:25.952
Don't you forget that.

00:05:25.985 --> 00:05:28.356
I know my place in this fight.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.826
If you still wish to win,

00:05:29.859 --> 00:05:31.830
then using this
opportunity to reveal

00:05:31.864 --> 00:05:35.170
their abilities would
better serve our Dark Lord.

00:05:35.204 --> 00:05:36.438
[growling]

00:06:27.307 --> 00:06:28.510
[battle cry]

00:06:30.782 --> 00:06:31.916
[roaring]

00:06:41.737 --> 00:06:44.174
[roaring]

00:06:49.051 --> 00:06:50.420
[roaring]

00:06:50.453 --> 00:06:51.990
Very well...

00:06:54.395 --> 00:06:55.564
One must always know

00:06:55.598 --> 00:06:58.637
when it's time to
realign one's priorities!

00:06:59.606 --> 00:07:01.543
Hym: You're mine,
little Hero!

00:07:08.924 --> 00:07:09.959
Frizz!

00:07:16.171 --> 00:07:18.543
Albinass [thought]:
That's it, Hym. Keep it up.

00:07:24.856 --> 00:07:27.494
You must be my
opponent, today.

00:07:27.528 --> 00:07:28.864
How foolish.

00:07:28.897 --> 00:07:32.137
You could have pierced my
core from behind, just now.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.075
Fair fight. Okay?

00:07:34.108 --> 00:07:35.243
Albinass: [chuckling]

00:07:35.277 --> 00:07:36.646
Don't be concerned.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.055
If it's a fair fight you want,
then I should hold back...

00:07:41.088 --> 00:07:43.326
But that is not our mission.

00:07:43.359 --> 00:07:44.963
Prepare yourself.

00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:46.633
You're quite brave.

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:48.203
But I think you're
underestimating

00:07:48.236 --> 00:07:50.541
the Disciples of Avan.

00:07:50.575 --> 00:07:52.912
Hyunckel: That one you
refer to as the "pawn?"

00:07:52.945 --> 00:07:54.917
Did you actually
think you would stop Dai

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.822
by pitting the weakest
piece against him?

00:07:57.855 --> 00:08:00.728
Albinass: You're the
one underestimating us.

00:08:01.295 --> 00:08:02.798
Excuse my saying,

00:08:02.832 --> 00:08:05.872
but I don't believe you're
familiar with the game of chess,

00:08:05.905 --> 00:08:07.074
am I right?

00:08:07.107 --> 00:08:08.075
If you were,

00:08:08.109 --> 00:08:10.247
you'd know that no piece
is stronger or weaker.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.419
Albinass: Every piece has
its own set of abilities.

00:08:13.452 --> 00:08:17.895
But in reality, a Pawn and a
Queen have the same strength.

00:08:17.929 --> 00:08:20.668
Albinass: It's all
a matter of tactics.

00:08:20.701 --> 00:08:22.370
Recognize your
opponent's skills

00:08:22.404 --> 00:08:24.675
and deploy your
pieces accordingly.

00:08:24.709 --> 00:08:29.151
Strategy is what wins a
game of chess, not strength.

00:08:29.184 --> 00:08:32.290
Dai: [roaring]

00:08:34.261 --> 00:08:36.398
Dai [thought]:
It's right there!

00:08:36.431 --> 00:08:38.970
I just need to
focus my attack...

00:08:40.742 --> 00:08:41.543
Now!

00:08:41.576 --> 00:08:43.446
Dai: Avan Style
Sword Technique...

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.083
Air Slash!

00:08:49.124 --> 00:08:51.863
Hym: If you're using
this knife against me,

00:08:51.896 --> 00:08:55.103
you still don't understand
the level of my power.

00:08:55.136 --> 00:08:56.239
Am I wrong?

00:08:56.272 --> 00:08:59.177
Or is that thing on your
back nothing but a decoration?

00:09:00.213 --> 00:09:01.082
Well?!

00:09:01.115 --> 00:09:02.051
No, Dai!

00:09:02.084 --> 00:09:03.553
[chuckling]

00:09:03.587 --> 00:09:05.525
I believe that
Hym is unmatched

00:09:05.558 --> 00:09:08.062
when it comes to
close-quartered combat.

00:09:08.095 --> 00:09:10.266
You'll find, that with
the Hero distracted,

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.872
your team is at
a disadvantage.

00:09:18.082 --> 00:09:21.556
Block: [menacing growl]

00:09:21.589 --> 00:09:23.960
[pained gargle]

00:09:29.739 --> 00:09:31.944
Maam [thought]: I can't
shatter that shield.

00:09:31.977 --> 00:09:34.883
I need to find a way
to control his movements.

00:09:34.916 --> 00:09:37.822
Sigma: For a human to
achieve this kind of speed

00:09:37.855 --> 00:09:39.960
is quite the accomplishment.

00:09:39.993 --> 00:09:40.828
Thanks.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:46.104
However...

00:09:48.142 --> 00:09:51.849
No creature alive can eclipse
the agility of the knight!

00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:54.922
It appears that my fellow
pieces have a better strategy

00:09:54.956 --> 00:09:57.161
than your band of misfits.

00:09:57.194 --> 00:09:58.162
That so?

00:09:58.196 --> 00:09:59.599
Let's see how they do when

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:02.036
I remove the queen
that's commanding them!

00:10:03.306 --> 00:10:04.609
Hyunckel [thought]: What?!

00:10:04.643 --> 00:10:06.746
The thing about
the queen is...

00:10:06.779 --> 00:10:09.819
she has everyone
else's abilities.

00:10:11.322 --> 00:10:14.996
This is looking bad.
They're controlling the fight!

00:10:15.029 --> 00:10:16.498
I need them grouped together,

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:19.337
otherwise my spell's
gonna be useless.

00:10:20.206 --> 00:10:21.676
What can we do?

00:10:21.709 --> 00:10:23.446
Popp: And where did
that pointy-headed guy

00:10:23.479 --> 00:10:25.249
who was chasing me go?

00:10:26.754 --> 00:10:28.322
Fenbren: Right here!

00:10:29.593 --> 00:10:31.697
Fenbren: You're wide open.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.767
And you're toast!

00:10:35.102 --> 00:10:35.838
[alarmed shriek]

00:10:35.871 --> 00:10:38.008
M-My brand-new staff!

00:10:38.042 --> 00:10:40.982
Fenbren: Over eighty percent
of my body is blades.

00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:44.488
I don't recommend
getting so close.

00:10:44.523 --> 00:10:47.127
Get back! I said get back!

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.229
Popp!

00:10:49.264 --> 00:10:50.233
Hym: Come on...

00:10:50.267 --> 00:10:53.874
You don't have time to
worry about the others!

00:11:02.925 --> 00:11:04.695
Dai [thought]:
It won't come out?

00:11:05.797 --> 00:11:08.035
How disappointing
this has been.

00:11:09.573 --> 00:11:13.880
What kind of a warrior carries
a weapon they can't even use?!

00:11:13.914 --> 00:11:18.389
It seems as if the boy hasn't
mastered that sword of his, yet.

00:11:19.425 --> 00:11:20.861
Well, if this is the case,

00:11:20.894 --> 00:11:24.067
perhaps we needn't bother
summoning Lord Hadlar.

00:11:24.101 --> 00:11:26.438
I wouldn't be
so sure about that!

00:11:29.912 --> 00:11:32.752
Albinass [thought]: Impossible!
He landed an attack?!

00:11:32.785 --> 00:11:34.822
Hyunckel: Fortunately for us,

00:11:34.855 --> 00:11:37.060
we humans aren't chess pieces.

00:11:37.093 --> 00:11:40.534
You can talk about whatever
strategy you have planned-

00:11:40.567 --> 00:11:42.838
but this isn't
that kind of game.

00:11:43.674 --> 00:11:44.809
Sizz!

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.451
Fenbren: Futile, futile!

00:11:59.606 --> 00:12:00.507
Everyone!

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:01.843
Hym: Come on.

00:12:01.876 --> 00:12:04.014
Hym: This is your last chance.

00:12:06.586 --> 00:12:07.988
Dai [thought]: We're losing...

00:12:08.022 --> 00:12:10.794
And we're out of options.

00:12:10.827 --> 00:12:13.700
If my sword would
just cooperate,

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:16.372
I could defeat
them so easily...

00:12:16.405 --> 00:12:19.779
Why?! Why won't it unlock?!

00:12:20.614 --> 00:12:21.883
[exasperated roar]

00:12:21.917 --> 00:12:25.323
What a joke. You can't
even draw your blade.

00:12:25.357 --> 00:12:28.863
Lord Hadlar's time is
better spent elsewhere.

00:12:28.897 --> 00:12:31.268
So let's speed
things along, then.

00:12:31.301 --> 00:12:34.307
My Heat Knuckle will
make short work of you.

00:12:36.546 --> 00:12:38.817
Fenbren: Time to finish this.

00:12:39.886 --> 00:12:41.122
Fenbren: Don't worry.

00:12:41.155 --> 00:12:45.429
It'll all be over
before you feel a thing.

00:12:48.235 --> 00:12:50.207
Popp: Nova?!

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.045
Fenbren: Curse you,
you feeble weakling!

00:12:54.548 --> 00:12:56.919
Quickly, I need
to use your staff!

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.026
Hym: It's over!

00:13:09.044 --> 00:13:10.046
Nova!

00:13:10.079 --> 00:13:12.484
Just in time. Thank you.

00:13:12.518 --> 00:13:14.889
No thanks needed.

00:13:14.923 --> 00:13:19.264
It's a Hero's duty to
protect... the weak...

00:13:20.601 --> 00:13:22.805
Don't worry.
He's just unconscious.

00:13:22.838 --> 00:13:24.041
[relieved sigh]

00:13:24.074 --> 00:13:26.680
He's exhausted from
using up all of his Aura.

00:13:26.713 --> 00:13:28.517
It's impressive, really.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.453
He's tougher than I thought.

00:13:30.486 --> 00:13:32.825
He fought to the very limit.

00:13:35.798 --> 00:13:38.503
Then we're going to
have to do the same.

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:55.604
Dai: It's no good.

00:13:55.637 --> 00:13:56.973
All this training,

00:13:57.006 --> 00:14:00.079
and I couldn't even
draw my sword one time!

00:14:00.814 --> 00:14:02.350
Hyunckel's already mastered

00:14:02.383 --> 00:14:05.958
how to wield his Dark
Armor Spear, and I just...

00:14:05.992 --> 00:14:08.664
I just... I can't...

00:14:08.697 --> 00:14:10.834
It's only natural, boy.

00:14:10.867 --> 00:14:14.308
Can't you see?
Of course it can't be drawn.

00:14:14.341 --> 00:14:18.048
Lon: The Sword of Dai can't be
unsheathed for just anyone-

00:14:18.082 --> 00:14:20.554
especially a retired
warrior like me.

00:14:20.587 --> 00:14:25.096
But, the real reason
it refuses to be drawn...

00:14:25.129 --> 00:14:29.037
is your inability to
properly read your opponent.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:33.045
The problem lies
within you, Dai.

00:14:33.747 --> 00:14:36.384
Within... Then how?

00:14:39.157 --> 00:14:40.426
Dai [thought]: That's it...

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:43.432
Ever since I destroyed
Sovereign Rock Castle,

00:14:43.465 --> 00:14:48.242
I've been subconsciously
relying on the sword's power.

00:14:48.276 --> 00:14:52.150
I mistook the power I wielded
with the sword as my own.

00:14:53.419 --> 00:14:57.861
But... this blade has
a soul, doesn't it?

00:14:57.895 --> 00:15:00.934
It can read my enemies
far better than I can.

00:15:02.137 --> 00:15:04.174
I'd forgotten that!

00:15:05.076 --> 00:15:08.049
My sword will only
lend me its power when

00:15:08.082 --> 00:15:09.919
I've fought to the very limit

00:15:09.952 --> 00:15:13.292
of my own strength
and abilities.

00:15:15.063 --> 00:15:18.671
Nova, seeing you
fight so desperately

00:15:18.704 --> 00:15:20.139
has made me understand

00:15:20.173 --> 00:15:22.511
what Lon Beruk was
trying to teach me.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:30.493
I guess we both have
a lot to learn as Heroes.

00:15:30.528 --> 00:15:31.663
Dai: There's still a way!

00:15:31.696 --> 00:15:33.098
What? What d'you mean?

00:15:33.132 --> 00:15:35.436
If my sword won't
let itself be drawn,

00:15:35.469 --> 00:15:38.142
I think that means there's
still a way to defeat them

00:15:38.176 --> 00:15:40.012
that we haven't tried yet.

00:15:42.585 --> 00:15:43.953
Pathetic...

00:15:49.297 --> 00:15:51.603
You and your foolish meddling.

00:15:51.636 --> 00:15:53.707
You will pay!

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.445
Dai: Full power...
Draconic Aura!

00:15:56.479 --> 00:15:58.483
[roaring]

00:15:58.517 --> 00:16:00.119
[battle cry]

00:16:02.824 --> 00:16:04.762
[pained yelp]

00:16:04.796 --> 00:16:06.566
Dai, knock him over here!

00:16:06.599 --> 00:16:07.535
Dai [thought]: That's right.

00:16:07.568 --> 00:16:09.805
I'm not the only one
who can use Air attacks!

00:16:09.839 --> 00:16:12.377
Hyunckel: Avan Style
Spear Technique!

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:13.680
Air Strike!

00:16:15.784 --> 00:16:16.752
Fenbren: Hym!

00:16:19.758 --> 00:16:20.594
Nice thinking!

00:16:20.627 --> 00:16:22.564
All right. That's one down!

00:16:22.598 --> 00:16:23.733
No.

00:16:30.213 --> 00:16:32.685
But I thought you
mastered the Air Strike.

00:16:32.718 --> 00:16:33.686
What happened?

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:37.327
It's not exactly
the easiest one.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.065
Hyunckel: I didn't feel
this until just now-

00:16:40.099 --> 00:16:42.070
a needle from
the queen's attack.

00:16:42.103 --> 00:16:43.840
I can't aim right.

00:16:43.874 --> 00:16:46.713
If it weren't for
this, it'd be over.

00:16:46.747 --> 00:16:48.349
Those can be fatal,

00:16:48.382 --> 00:16:51.923
you have to be careful
where they hit you.

00:16:51.956 --> 00:16:55.095
I hope you heal
quickly, warrior.

00:16:55.129 --> 00:16:57.734
Hey, Maam!
Maam, we need you!

00:17:04.447 --> 00:17:05.450
Get back here!

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:08.322
Albinass: Royal Guards-
we need to regroup.

00:17:09.457 --> 00:17:10.660
Understood.

00:17:17.073 --> 00:17:18.810
And... Squelch.

00:17:25.658 --> 00:17:27.595
Hym: I can't lift my arm.

00:17:27.628 --> 00:17:28.630
Fenbren?

00:17:28.663 --> 00:17:29.798
Fenbren: My pleasure.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.284
That'll makes things easier.

00:17:39.318 --> 00:17:42.156
Well, I misjudged
the boy's strength.

00:17:42.189 --> 00:17:44.261
Sorry, Albinass.

00:17:44.294 --> 00:17:46.231
It seems I did as well.

00:17:46.265 --> 00:17:49.237
These Disciples of Avan
have grown far more powerful

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:51.776
and unpredictable than
what our Lord Hadlar

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:53.713
had described to us.

00:17:53.746 --> 00:17:56.619
Although our abilities
may surpass theirs,

00:17:56.652 --> 00:17:59.825
their combined experience
makes them relentless.

00:17:59.859 --> 00:18:02.063
We must use caution.

00:18:02.096 --> 00:18:04.500
You should be okay now.

00:18:04.535 --> 00:18:05.703
Thank you.

00:18:05.737 --> 00:18:08.977
So, the pawn thinks he can
fight without one of his arms.

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:12.016
Where do they get
this tenacity from? Huh?

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.087
I think Popp has a point.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.224
They are confident
in their purpose

00:18:16.258 --> 00:18:18.428
and their sense of
unity, aren't they?

00:18:18.462 --> 00:18:22.772
I may have missed, but you
were on the right track, Dai.

00:18:22.805 --> 00:18:24.207
You've got your friends.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.614
Hyunckel: Don't try
to do everything yourself.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.021
Crocodine: I made
my own discovery.

00:18:31.054 --> 00:18:32.524
Hyunckel: What was that?

00:18:32.558 --> 00:18:37.300
One on one, each of their
abilities is far beyond our own.

00:18:37.333 --> 00:18:40.674
We cannot win by simply
fighting power with power

00:18:40.708 --> 00:18:42.477
or speed with speed.

00:18:42.511 --> 00:18:46.485
We must fight their strengths
with our own unique skills.

00:18:46.519 --> 00:18:50.927
I get it. Trying to match
them isn't going to work.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.599
'Kay, then let's
switch things up!

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:57.641
Maam, you should use your
speed to confuse the big one.

00:18:57.674 --> 00:18:58.610
And Crocodine;

00:18:58.643 --> 00:19:01.481
use your strength to
overpower that knight.

00:19:02.216 --> 00:19:03.620
Dai and Hyunckel,

00:19:03.653 --> 00:19:06.559
I need you to take the other
three at exactly the same time.

00:19:06.593 --> 00:19:08.564
Don't lose 'em -
keep them together.

00:19:08.597 --> 00:19:09.632
Yeah.

00:19:09.665 --> 00:19:13.372
In the meantime, I'll get
the Medroa spell ready.

00:19:13.406 --> 00:19:15.778
Once the knight's
mirror is disabled,

00:19:15.811 --> 00:19:17.814
try to gather them together.

00:19:17.848 --> 00:19:21.623
The spell is going to be
huge, so get some distance.

00:19:21.656 --> 00:19:22.792
Got it?

00:19:22.825 --> 00:19:23.693
All: Right!

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.898
Here we go...

00:19:25.931 --> 00:19:29.938
Beast King Redemption Blast!

00:19:56.759 --> 00:19:57.994
Okay...

00:20:08.049 --> 00:20:09.284
Pathetic.

00:20:09.317 --> 00:20:12.792
You can't defeat me
with an Aura Flow this weak!

00:20:12.825 --> 00:20:13.893
[chuckling]

00:20:13.927 --> 00:20:17.033
Then it's time for the
second whirlpool, isn't it?!

00:20:17.066 --> 00:20:18.302
What?

00:20:18.335 --> 00:20:21.041
Crocodine: I threw myself
into the Valge Whirlpool

00:20:21.074 --> 00:20:22.545
to master this...

00:20:22.578 --> 00:20:26.852
Let's see you
withstand two Aura Flows!

00:20:26.886 --> 00:20:31.394
[roaring]

00:20:33.298 --> 00:20:36.004
A second blast
with a reverse spin?!

00:20:42.016 --> 00:20:43.953
[roaring]

00:20:46.725 --> 00:20:49.631
Beast King...
Indomitable Blast!

00:20:51.201 --> 00:20:54.942
[howling]

00:20:58.148 --> 00:20:59.685
Sigma!

00:21:02.858 --> 00:21:03.927
It's time.

00:21:03.961 --> 00:21:05.563
Everybody - scatter!

00:21:07.835 --> 00:21:09.204
A spell won't work!

00:21:09.237 --> 00:21:10.173
But it will!

00:21:10.206 --> 00:21:12.511
Medroa!

00:21:24.568 --> 00:21:26.772
Crocodine [thought]:
W-What power!

00:21:26.805 --> 00:21:29.143
Hyunckel [thought]:
That's worth bragging about.

00:21:29.176 --> 00:21:32.150
Well done,
learning such a spell.

00:21:32.183 --> 00:21:34.086
Maam [thought]:
That's amazing, Popp!

00:21:39.832 --> 00:21:42.269
Popp! You really did it!

00:21:42.303 --> 00:21:45.176
So that's what all your
training was for, huh?

00:21:45.209 --> 00:21:47.246
Phew, there
was nothing to it!

00:21:47.279 --> 00:21:50.086
There's no way I
missed with that one.

00:21:50.119 --> 00:21:52.624
One hit with a Medroa...

00:22:02.143 --> 00:22:03.713
The end.

00:23:37.668 --> 00:23:40.707
Narrator: With the battle won
thanks to Popp's Medroa spell,

00:23:40.741 --> 00:23:43.679
Dai's party breathes
a sigh of relief.

00:23:44.815 --> 00:23:46.785
Meanwhile, Chiu
and his companions

00:23:46.819 --> 00:23:49.024
infiltrate the
Field of Death,

00:23:49.057 --> 00:23:49.959
but before they unravel

00:23:49.992 --> 00:23:52.531
the secret of the
Dark Army's stronghold,

00:23:52.564 --> 00:23:54.968
they fall into
the enemy's grasp.

00:23:55.837 --> 00:23:57.641
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:57.674 --> 00:24:00.412
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:00.446 --> 00:24:02.884
"We're the Beast
King Commandos".
