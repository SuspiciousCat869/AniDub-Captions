WEBVTT

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.436
[shocked gasps]

00:02:20.113 --> 00:02:21.416
Is he dead?

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:24.723
No... He's alive -
I can feel it.

00:02:24.757 --> 00:02:25.490
Huh?

00:02:27.696 --> 00:02:30.535
Dai: He's barely
hanging on by a thread...

00:02:30.568 --> 00:02:33.406
I don't think he
can fight anymore.

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:42.659
Vearn: Clever, indeed.

00:02:42.693 --> 00:02:45.430
I couldn't withstand
that much force...

00:02:45.464 --> 00:02:49.338
Even with the protection of
my mighty Staff of Edacity.

00:02:54.916 --> 00:02:56.485
Vearn: [gasp]

00:03:02.865 --> 00:03:05.136
Vearn: Although, it would
appear as if its power

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.911
was all that stood
between me and my demise.

00:03:08.944 --> 00:03:11.784
A truly impressive display.

00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:13.854
Your father would be proud.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.392
[chuckling]

00:03:17.895 --> 00:03:19.165
Testing the combined strength

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:22.772
of all Dragon Knights
nearly destroyed me.

00:03:22.805 --> 00:03:26.179
Vearn: I was certain I had a
firm grasp of your abilities...

00:03:26.212 --> 00:03:27.381
Only, once again,

00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:30.153
you've gone above and
beyond my expectations.

00:03:30.187 --> 00:03:31.657
I'll give credit
where it is due,

00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:34.863
but I won't have you
kill me like this.

00:03:34.896 --> 00:03:36.600
After all, this body...

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:40.106
is what I suppose you'd
call the mere base of me.

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.246
The "base" of you?
Y-You mean...

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.618
Vearn: That's right, Dai.

00:03:45.651 --> 00:03:47.187
It sounds a bit like a riddle,

00:03:47.221 --> 00:03:48.524
but the simplest
way to put it...

00:03:48.557 --> 00:03:50.227
is that the man
standing before us

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.732
both is and is
not the Dark King.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.905
There's no other explanation.

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:57.141
The Secret Spell
of Frozen time

00:03:57.174 --> 00:04:00.447
isn't the type of incantation
you can cast upon yourself.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.552
Moreover, only
those who've mastered

00:04:02.586 --> 00:04:04.656
the highest levels of
Magic Power are able to

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:06.794
conjure it without
catastrophe.

00:04:06.827 --> 00:04:09.198
In my case, because
I wasn't strong enough

00:04:09.232 --> 00:04:11.837
to keep its force
concentrated on my enemy,

00:04:11.871 --> 00:04:14.642
not only did I wind up
caught in the spell myself,

00:04:14.676 --> 00:04:17.181
but Hadlar was also
able to escape.

00:04:17.214 --> 00:04:19.084
So my friends and I
banded together again

00:04:19.118 --> 00:04:21.122
and vowed to finish
what we'd started.

00:04:21.155 --> 00:04:24.494
I trained until I perfected
my Avan Style Sword Technique -

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:27.836
to defeat the
Dark Lord for good.

00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:30.742
Avan: But that's beside
the point. Here's my theory...

00:04:30.775 --> 00:04:32.812
The only one who
could correctly perform

00:04:32.846 --> 00:04:36.620
the Secret Spell of Frozen
Time is the Dark King himself.

00:04:36.653 --> 00:04:37.321
Therefore...

00:04:37.354 --> 00:04:38.557
I suspect he's found a method

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.495
that allows him to
occupy two bodies.

00:04:42.966 --> 00:04:45.938
Avan: The Mystvearn we thought
we were facing all this time...

00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:49.044
Never actually existed
in the first place.

00:04:50.013 --> 00:04:51.382
Avan: He said it himself...

00:04:51.415 --> 00:04:54.522
But what's less
obvious is who said it.

00:04:57.194 --> 00:05:00.768
I gather the real Myst is a
creature of the Underworld...

00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:04.108
A creature Vearn's entrusted
to guard his true form...

00:05:04.141 --> 00:05:06.412
Or perhaps only a copy of it.

00:05:06.446 --> 00:05:08.717
Whatever it is,
he's fused with it,

00:05:08.751 --> 00:05:11.156
creating what we
know as "Mystvearn."

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:12.491
A being suspended within

00:05:12.525 --> 00:05:15.698
the Secret Spell of Frozen
time becomes immovable.

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:17.969
They're turned into
a living statue.

00:05:18.002 --> 00:05:19.105
But in theory,

00:05:19.138 --> 00:05:21.509
if there happened to be a
certain type of monster...

00:05:21.543 --> 00:05:24.649
able to merge with that body
and assume control of it...

00:05:24.683 --> 00:05:26.587
Then the result would
be a superior warrior

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.793
with a body that's
more or less immortal.

00:05:29.826 --> 00:05:32.063
And the monster who
possesses such abilities

00:05:32.097 --> 00:05:34.335
is none other than "Myst."

00:05:34.368 --> 00:05:35.838
Show yourself.

00:05:38.142 --> 00:05:40.681
[chuckling]

00:05:41.583 --> 00:05:43.019
Wh-What happened to his voice?

00:05:43.053 --> 00:05:46.726
So this is the real voice
he's been hiding all this time.

00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:52.037
Myst: You're spot-on
as usual, Avan.

00:05:52.071 --> 00:05:55.010
This body does indeed
belong to the Dark King.

00:05:55.043 --> 00:05:58.617
As a matter of fact,
it's his original vessel.

00:05:58.651 --> 00:06:00.755
Myst: His Majesty
left it in my care,

00:06:00.788 --> 00:06:02.424
along with strict
orders to keep

00:06:02.458 --> 00:06:04.897
its identity hidden
at all costs...

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.602
In the meantime,
he's been gracious enough

00:06:07.635 --> 00:06:11.376
to allow me to use this
body's terrifying strength

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:13.379
to fight when necessary.

00:06:13.412 --> 00:06:16.352
Of course, I require
King Vearn's permission

00:06:16.385 --> 00:06:19.224
before I can unleash
its full omnipotence...

00:06:19.258 --> 00:06:22.097
Nevertheless, I am
the inky black Myst,

00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:25.437
shrouding the true appearance
of my sovereign master...

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:26.405
That is to say...

00:06:26.438 --> 00:06:29.411
I am Mystvearn!

00:06:29.445 --> 00:06:32.284
Vearn: The time has come.

00:06:32.318 --> 00:06:34.021
It's the Dark King!

00:06:34.054 --> 00:06:37.361
Myst: Oh! Y-Your Majesty...

00:06:37.394 --> 00:06:38.797
Please forgive me.

00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:42.237
The Reaper was defeated, and
left to my own devices, I...

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:43.975
I had no choice.

00:06:44.008 --> 00:06:45.678
Vearn: It matters not.

00:06:45.712 --> 00:06:49.118
Let us admit the
uncomfortable truth.

00:06:49.151 --> 00:06:52.457
This party's power has
proven to be greater than

00:06:52.491 --> 00:06:55.097
either of us anticipated.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.704
Vearn: I almost met my own
destruction at Dai's hand.

00:06:58.737 --> 00:07:01.442
It seems that at long last,
the day has arrived

00:07:01.475 --> 00:07:03.514
where I must take
back the dreadful force

00:07:03.547 --> 00:07:06.219
I have placed in your care.

00:07:06.252 --> 00:07:07.320
Myst: My liege...

00:07:07.354 --> 00:07:09.058
I shall return it at once.

00:07:09.091 --> 00:07:11.529
The true incarnation of
the Dark King Vearn

00:07:11.563 --> 00:07:14.435
is unrivaled in
the Trio of Worlds.

00:07:14.468 --> 00:07:16.673
Dai will be no match for it.

00:07:28.965 --> 00:07:30.233
Where did he go now?

00:07:37.213 --> 00:07:38.583
[alarmed breath]

00:07:53.145 --> 00:07:55.049
In order to extend my lifespan

00:07:55.083 --> 00:07:58.624
to the point where I could
enjoy the fruits of eternity...

00:07:58.657 --> 00:08:02.965
A sacrifice was needed,
and I divided my body in two.

00:08:08.409 --> 00:08:09.846
This base form I've inhabited

00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:13.554
retains my collected
wisdom and Magic Power...

00:08:13.587 --> 00:08:15.691
While my youth and
strength have been preserved

00:08:15.724 --> 00:08:19.064
in the body I've
had Mystvearn guarding.

00:08:19.098 --> 00:08:22.137
Every century, at the height
of each full solar eclipse,

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.809
I recast the Secret
Spell of Frozen Time,

00:08:24.842 --> 00:08:26.646
sealing myself in
peak condition,

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.053
ready to be unleashed
when challengers arise.

00:08:30.086 --> 00:08:33.693
And thanks to you we
shall finally reunite.

00:08:39.873 --> 00:08:42.511
How many millennia
has it been?

00:08:42.545 --> 00:08:45.851
I stopped keeping
track so long ago...

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:20.855
This... is no longer needed.

00:09:20.888 --> 00:09:24.461
Lon Beruk's Staff of Edacity
has served its purpose well...

00:09:24.495 --> 00:09:26.900
but I've grown beyond it.

00:09:26.934 --> 00:09:29.271
True Vearn: I knew I'd need
something to compensate

00:09:29.304 --> 00:09:31.442
for my weaker, elderly form...

00:09:31.475 --> 00:09:34.549
It was designed
for my protection.

00:09:34.583 --> 00:09:36.620
But now that this
body is whole again,

00:09:36.653 --> 00:09:39.124
I have all that I need.

00:09:52.652 --> 00:09:55.490
I've been returned to my
full power so quickly...

00:09:55.524 --> 00:09:58.028
this could take me a
little getting used to.

00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:02.303
Then again, what's the
harm in going overboard?

00:10:07.447 --> 00:10:08.617
Given what he's told us,

00:10:08.651 --> 00:10:11.155
it looks as if my
hypothesis was correct...

00:10:11.188 --> 00:10:14.729
And now Vearn has reclaimed
control of his original body.

00:10:14.762 --> 00:10:16.165
Well, it's no wonder we lost.

00:10:16.198 --> 00:10:18.068
If we were fighting
against someone who was

00:10:18.102 --> 00:10:20.674
wielding the power of
the Dark King Vearn himself,

00:10:20.707 --> 00:10:23.412
then I'm amazed we even
managed to keep up at all.

00:10:24.248 --> 00:10:25.851
What a gutless little joker.

00:10:25.885 --> 00:10:27.922
Showing off and
boasting about power

00:10:27.955 --> 00:10:29.926
that really belonged
to somebody else...

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.729
This creature
was just a parasite.

00:10:31.763 --> 00:10:34.134
I'll wager he couldn't
do anything on his own.

00:10:34.168 --> 00:10:36.807
Myst: Mind your
words, metal man...

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.375
Just his voice is left?

00:10:38.409 --> 00:10:41.081
More than that.
He's still here.

00:10:42.417 --> 00:10:43.920
Myst: Insults
of that nature...

00:10:43.954 --> 00:10:46.726
Especially from
the likes of you...

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.396
This must be...

00:10:48.429 --> 00:10:50.166
It has to be
the creature's...

00:10:50.199 --> 00:10:51.803
Myst: Quite so.

00:11:00.387 --> 00:11:03.527
Myst: Behold, Avan and
his doomed disciples...

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.397
My true form.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.133
A life form made out of gas?

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:10.373
No. I'd say it's better to
think of such a beast...

00:11:10.406 --> 00:11:13.246
as a conscious
mass of Dark Aura.

00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:14.883
He assumed a gaseous form...

00:11:14.916 --> 00:11:17.988
in order to take
possession of Vearn's body.

00:11:18.022 --> 00:11:20.761
Normally, he'd only enshroud
it under the Raiment,

00:11:20.794 --> 00:11:23.366
but when he was fighting,
he broke that seal...

00:11:23.399 --> 00:11:25.469
and used the body to attack.

00:11:28.009 --> 00:11:29.579
Maam [thought]: What
this ghost thing did

00:11:29.612 --> 00:11:30.848
to Popp and Grand Master...

00:11:30.881 --> 00:11:33.052
It's unforgivable.

00:11:33.086 --> 00:11:34.321
He'll pay!

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.458
Maam, wait!

00:11:36.491 --> 00:11:40.901
[charging roar]

00:11:44.408 --> 00:11:45.811
Myst: [devious snarl]

00:11:46.546 --> 00:11:48.215
Miss Maam! No!

00:11:52.558 --> 00:11:53.894
Myst: You silly girl.

00:11:53.927 --> 00:11:56.199
Physical attacks
won't work on me -

00:11:56.232 --> 00:11:57.968
I have no physical form.

00:11:58.002 --> 00:12:01.475
Come at me carelessly...
and look what happens!

00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:03.346
[pained cry]

00:12:03.379 --> 00:12:06.452
Myst: This is the price you
pay for such foolishness.

00:12:06.485 --> 00:12:07.755
As your master deduced,

00:12:07.788 --> 00:12:10.093
I am indeed a mass
of Dark Aura...

00:12:10.126 --> 00:12:11.830
An entity that is
something between

00:12:11.863 --> 00:12:14.434
a gaseous life
form and a ghost.

00:12:14.468 --> 00:12:16.038
Like a pearl of darkness,

00:12:16.072 --> 00:12:18.577
I was born from the evil
thoughts which have festered

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.719
over thousands of years
in the Underworld.

00:12:22.752 --> 00:12:24.689
While I may be without
a physical form,

00:12:24.722 --> 00:12:26.893
my fighting instinct remains.

00:12:26.926 --> 00:12:29.666
And with those instincts
I developed the ability to

00:12:29.699 --> 00:12:32.204
take control of other
living creatures...

00:12:32.237 --> 00:12:33.406
Like so.

00:12:33.439 --> 00:12:37.180
[screaming]

00:12:37.214 --> 00:12:38.817
Myst: Once I've
captured my target,

00:12:38.851 --> 00:12:40.921
all I need to do is
erase their soul

00:12:40.955 --> 00:12:42.925
and the body is
mine to inhabit.

00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:46.064
Before the Dark King found me,
I roamed the Underworld,

00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:48.436
leaping from one mighty
creature to the next,

00:12:48.469 --> 00:12:49.538
growing in power.

00:12:49.572 --> 00:12:53.345
It was all I could do...
Until Vearn gave me purpose.

00:12:53.379 --> 00:12:55.015
So that explains it, then.

00:12:55.049 --> 00:12:57.054
The reason you never
lost respect for

00:12:57.087 --> 00:12:58.656
warriors of great strength.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.395
Hadlar or Baran
or even Lon Beruk...

00:13:01.428 --> 00:13:03.466
is because they have
something you don't:

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.902
a body of their own.

00:13:04.935 --> 00:13:06.171
Myst: Exactly.

00:13:06.204 --> 00:13:08.376
While I may be able to
wield tremendous strength

00:13:08.409 --> 00:13:10.981
simply by stealing
the form of another...

00:13:11.015 --> 00:13:15.222
I cannot grow strong
through my own efforts alone.

00:13:15.256 --> 00:13:19.331
Anyone who can is worthy
of the utmost respect.

00:13:19.364 --> 00:13:22.470
In fact, I envy them.

00:13:24.743 --> 00:13:29.184
Myst: There's no need to look at
me with such pity, Crocodine.

00:13:30.119 --> 00:13:32.157
Myst: Thanks to this
accursed nature of mine,

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:34.729
I was able to meet King Vearn.

00:13:34.762 --> 00:13:36.867
And His Majesty said it best:

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.637
"This is your destiny, Myst.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:42.812
You were born to serve as
my trusted right-hand man."

00:13:42.845 --> 00:13:44.682
Don't you see
the beauty of it?

00:13:44.715 --> 00:13:47.019
The Dark King
required my abilities,

00:13:47.053 --> 00:13:49.457
and I needed a great
master like him.

00:13:49.491 --> 00:13:50.861
With or without his body,

00:13:50.894 --> 00:13:53.466
I must continue
to do his bidding!

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:56.338
[agonized howl]

00:13:56.773 --> 00:13:58.510
Let her go!

00:14:01.248 --> 00:14:03.419
Chiu: You can take
my body instead...

00:14:03.452 --> 00:14:05.557
Just leave Miss Maam alone!

00:14:06.793 --> 00:14:07.728
Out of my way.

00:14:07.762 --> 00:14:08.997
Huh?

00:14:13.439 --> 00:14:14.508
[shocked gasps]

00:14:44.234 --> 00:14:47.140
Hmm. This is even
better than I thought.

00:14:47.173 --> 00:14:49.545
I didn't realize she
had so much strength.

00:14:49.578 --> 00:14:50.848
He's taken over Maam's body...

00:14:50.881 --> 00:14:52.551
what are we supposed to do now?

00:14:52.584 --> 00:14:53.887
There's only one thing to do,

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.125
and I suggest you
hold nothing back.

00:14:56.158 --> 00:14:58.328
That is... assuming any
of you actually has

00:14:58.362 --> 00:15:00.968
the nerve to attack
one of your own.

00:15:01.001 --> 00:15:02.437
Don't underestimate me.

00:15:02.471 --> 00:15:05.009
One doesn't win a fight if they
aren't willing to risk a loss.

00:15:05.043 --> 00:15:06.345
There's no way
you're as strong

00:15:06.378 --> 00:15:08.482
with Maam's body as
you were with Vearn's.

00:15:08.517 --> 00:15:10.453
It doesn't matter
what happens to her

00:15:10.487 --> 00:15:11.790
if we're able to eliminate

00:15:11.823 --> 00:15:13.760
Master Dai's enemy,
right here and now.

00:15:13.794 --> 00:15:15.063
Are you hearing yourself?

00:15:15.096 --> 00:15:17.701
It does matter. Shame on you!

00:15:17.735 --> 00:15:19.839
And, you... you too, Myst.

00:15:19.872 --> 00:15:23.045
Taking a hostage like this to
force us into a stalemate...

00:15:23.078 --> 00:15:24.916
That's hardly a
strategy befitting

00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:26.653
the likes of you, isn't it?

00:15:26.686 --> 00:15:29.024
Oh, please. "Hostage?"

00:15:29.057 --> 00:15:31.128
Now you're
underestimating me.

00:15:31.161 --> 00:15:32.865
If you think I'm
using your friend

00:15:32.898 --> 00:15:34.301
as a shield to defend myself,

00:15:34.334 --> 00:15:36.472
I can assure you,
you're mistaken.

00:15:36.506 --> 00:15:40.413
Because as it happens, under my
control, this young woman...

00:15:40.446 --> 00:15:42.584
is even capable of this.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.395
[roaring]

00:15:56.613 --> 00:15:57.548
Hold on!

00:16:17.187 --> 00:16:19.091
Crocodine [thought]:
Is this really still Maam?

00:16:19.124 --> 00:16:20.694
She's so strong...

00:16:20.727 --> 00:16:22.998
She's too strong!

00:16:23.934 --> 00:16:25.403
So, do you see what I mean?

00:16:25.437 --> 00:16:27.473
You really should've
heeded my warning.

00:16:27.508 --> 00:16:30.747
I wasn't bluffing when I told
you not to hold anything back.

00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:32.116
Perhaps you never noticed,

00:16:32.149 --> 00:16:34.387
but this girl usually
suppresses her full power

00:16:34.421 --> 00:16:36.291
out of concern
for her enemies.

00:16:36.325 --> 00:16:38.095
Only, now that she's
under my control,

00:16:38.128 --> 00:16:41.167
I'd like to explore
what she can really do.

00:16:42.671 --> 00:16:44.675
The results are interesting.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:51.187
Hyunckel [thought]: Maam
can't hang on much longer...

00:16:58.435 --> 00:17:02.243
You want to see nerve?
Here it comes.

00:17:02.276 --> 00:17:04.882
It's a shame to have
to do this to Maam...

00:17:04.916 --> 00:17:06.117
but with my Aura Knuckle,

00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:09.157
I think I can blow Myst
away once and for all.

00:17:09.191 --> 00:17:11.228
Perhaps one of you
actually is serious.

00:17:11.261 --> 00:17:12.598
Stand down, Hym.
You mustn't!

00:17:12.631 --> 00:17:14.334
Unless you have a
trick up your sleeve,

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:16.640
your punch would
pulverize Maam as well.

00:17:16.673 --> 00:17:17.975
You think I don't know that?

00:17:18.008 --> 00:17:20.046
For this to work,
there's no other way.

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:21.182
I'm sorry to say this,

00:17:21.215 --> 00:17:24.021
but it's a necessary
price for victory...

00:17:24.054 --> 00:17:25.422
We have to do it.

00:17:25.456 --> 00:17:29.164
Otherwise, there's no attack
that can defeat Myst alone.

00:17:29.197 --> 00:17:32.136
Hyunckel: You're
wrong... There is.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.583
Avan [thought]: He's right...
The Air Technique.

00:17:40.688 --> 00:17:42.557
Avan [thought]: I can use
it easily enough,

00:17:42.591 --> 00:17:44.895
but to strike down Myst
while leaving Maam unscathed

00:17:44.929 --> 00:17:46.198
will be a difficult.

00:17:46.231 --> 00:17:48.670
This is going to take
a bit of finesse...

00:17:49.271 --> 00:17:51.207
I would do it myself.

00:17:56.018 --> 00:17:57.955
Hyunckel: If I could
move like I used to,

00:17:57.988 --> 00:17:59.357
I wouldn't ask you to do it.

00:17:59.391 --> 00:18:01.662
But perhaps it's
better this way.

00:18:03.031 --> 00:18:05.202
Hyunckel: Maam is a
true Disciple of Avan.

00:18:05.236 --> 00:18:08.008
She has more faith in
the power of light and

00:18:08.042 --> 00:18:09.745
the legendary skill
of the great Hero

00:18:09.778 --> 00:18:12.450
than the rest of your
followers combined.

00:18:15.323 --> 00:18:18.495
And thanks to her,
I have faith in it, too.

00:18:19.999 --> 00:18:21.267
Avan [thought]: Well, well.

00:18:21.301 --> 00:18:24.174
This is what it means to
learn from your own student.

00:18:24.207 --> 00:18:25.677
May I borrow that?

00:18:29.986 --> 00:18:32.725
I'll use Avan Style
Spear Technique...

00:18:32.758 --> 00:18:33.893
The Air Strike!

00:18:39.639 --> 00:18:41.041
Will this actually work?

00:18:41.074 --> 00:18:44.281
I don't know, Hym.
I honestly don't know...

00:18:44.314 --> 00:18:46.185
Crocodine [thought]: We're
counting on you, Sir Avan.

00:18:46.218 --> 00:18:47.721
Maam's counting on you.

00:19:03.085 --> 00:19:04.822
She's running for it! Now!

00:19:05.557 --> 00:19:06.892
Air Strike!

00:19:11.201 --> 00:19:12.771
Oh no... Did it work?!

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:20.452
[astonished gasp]

00:19:20.486 --> 00:19:22.357
Looks like he got
her back to normal.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:23.893
It has to have worked, right?

00:19:23.927 --> 00:19:25.262
We aren't finished -

00:19:25.295 --> 00:19:27.467
right before I hit her that
creature left Maam's body.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.738
Any of us could be
his next target.

00:19:31.609 --> 00:19:32.376
Hym: Damnit!

00:19:32.409 --> 00:19:34.280
Where the hell
did that thing go?

00:19:35.517 --> 00:19:39.290
I think... His next
target might be...

00:19:39.324 --> 00:19:41.695
Myst: None other
than you, Hyunckel!

00:19:42.732 --> 00:19:44.869
[howling]

00:19:44.902 --> 00:19:46.305
Myst: That's exactly right.

00:19:46.338 --> 00:19:47.473
As a matter of fact...

00:19:47.507 --> 00:19:50.345
I've been after you
from the very beginning.

00:19:51.214 --> 00:19:52.517
Hyunckel, no!

00:19:52.551 --> 00:19:53.954
He has permanent injuries.

00:19:53.987 --> 00:19:56.759
Even if Myst takes him over,
he's not in any shape to fight.

00:19:56.793 --> 00:19:58.162
Why would he go after him?

00:19:58.195 --> 00:20:00.266
Let's cut him loose before
we worry about that.

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:01.134
Here we go.

00:20:01.167 --> 00:20:03.005
One more time...

00:20:03.038 --> 00:20:04.608
Air Strike!

00:20:09.284 --> 00:20:11.922
He deflected it...
without even trying!

00:20:16.064 --> 00:20:17.701
There could be no
stopping this now.

00:20:17.735 --> 00:20:20.072
Hyunckel's body is
filling with Dark Aura...

00:20:20.106 --> 00:20:21.776
It's strength is growing!

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:22.878
What? Are you sure?

00:20:22.911 --> 00:20:24.080
Makes sense to me.

00:20:24.114 --> 00:20:26.753
How else could he have deflected
a light attack like that?

00:20:26.786 --> 00:20:28.021
Myst: [evil laughter]

00:20:28.054 --> 00:20:29.324
How observant!

00:20:29.357 --> 00:20:32.397
This is why I chose Hyunckel!

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:35.002
Myst: The girl was merely
a temporary vessel.

00:20:35.035 --> 00:20:37.173
I never cared if
I got to keep her.

00:20:37.207 --> 00:20:39.578
But this one is
another story...

00:20:39.611 --> 00:20:41.448
Myst: His injuries
are irrelevant.

00:20:41.481 --> 00:20:44.253
Even if his entire
body is broken...

00:20:44.287 --> 00:20:46.224
Pain is meaningless to me.

00:20:46.258 --> 00:20:48.530
You're planning to leap
through every one of us

00:20:48.563 --> 00:20:51.368
until you've run all our bodies
into the ground, aren't you?

00:20:51.402 --> 00:20:53.305
You slippery fiend!

00:20:53.338 --> 00:20:56.746
Myst: Not so.
This body will be the last.

00:20:56.779 --> 00:20:59.384
Myst: You know I've been
grooming Hyunckel to serve

00:20:59.418 --> 00:21:02.289
as my permanent residence
for over a decade.

00:21:02.323 --> 00:21:05.196
I've prepared his body
specifically for the day

00:21:05.229 --> 00:21:06.932
when I would be
required to return

00:21:06.966 --> 00:21:09.303
the Dark King's true form.

00:21:09.337 --> 00:21:10.405
Crocodine: [shocked gasp]

00:21:16.118 --> 00:21:17.554
Avan [thought]:
This Aura's power...

00:21:17.588 --> 00:21:20.827
Myst radiated the same amount
when he was fused with Vearn.

00:21:24.835 --> 00:21:25.871
Myst: Feast your eyes...

00:21:25.904 --> 00:21:28.709
upon the birth of
the new Dark Warrior!

00:21:28.743 --> 00:21:30.312
Has he erased
Hyunckel's soul?

00:21:30.345 --> 00:21:32.416
Somebody, go cover the others!

00:21:41.001 --> 00:21:42.971
Hyunckel: Myst...

00:21:43.005 --> 00:21:44.575
Myst: I'm right
here, Hyunckel,

00:21:44.608 --> 00:21:46.979
moving through the depths
of your consciousness.

00:21:47.013 --> 00:21:49.652
It's quite a marvel to
hear your inner voice...

00:21:49.685 --> 00:21:52.290
but is that a hint
of alarm I detect?

00:21:52.323 --> 00:21:54.628
It will all be
over soon enough.

00:21:54.662 --> 00:21:58.836
Once your soul is extinguished,
this mighty vessel will be mine,

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:02.109
and I'll grind your
friends to dust!

00:22:02.142 --> 00:22:04.581
[evil cackle]

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.304
Narrator: As Myst
invades Hyunckel's mind,

00:23:39.337 --> 00:23:41.441
the pair battle for
control of his body,

00:23:41.475 --> 00:23:44.682
and the fate of his soul
itself hangs in the balance.

00:23:44.715 --> 00:23:47.588
Meanwhile, with the Dark
King's true form revealed,

00:23:47.621 --> 00:23:50.593
Dai must cast aside his
doubts and match the terror of

00:23:50.627 --> 00:23:53.799
his rival's undivided strength
with his ultimate attack.

00:23:53.833 --> 00:23:55.837
But against the
might of True Vearn,

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:57.774
can our Hero land
the first blow?

00:23:57.807 --> 00:23:59.477
