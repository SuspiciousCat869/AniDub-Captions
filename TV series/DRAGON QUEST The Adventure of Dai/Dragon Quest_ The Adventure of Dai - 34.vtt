WEBVTT

00:01:54.563 --> 00:01:59.171
It's here!
The balloon has returned!

00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:10.561
We're back!

00:02:10.594 --> 00:02:12.165
Your Highness.

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:13.333
So, where do you think

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:15.203
the princess has
been this whole time?

00:02:15.237 --> 00:02:17.809
Looks like she was busy
recruiting more members.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.255
Apollo: Princess Leona,
as the leader of a country,

00:02:24.288 --> 00:02:25.658
your behavior must reflect...

00:02:25.692 --> 00:02:28.731
Call for a meeting with the
key figures of each kingdom.

00:02:28.765 --> 00:02:30.467
Apollo: Huh?! Uh...

00:02:30.502 --> 00:02:33.574
We can't any
waste time. Now move!

00:02:33.608 --> 00:02:34.576
Princess!

00:02:35.311 --> 00:02:37.247
Wh-what's going on?

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.584
Dai: Leona...

00:02:38.617 --> 00:02:39.687
What about us?

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.124
For now, you will
all just have to wait.

00:02:42.157 --> 00:02:43.761
Use this time to rest...

00:02:43.795 --> 00:02:45.463
And to prepare for battle.

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:47.636
What battle?

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:52.177
Would somebody please just
tell me what's going on?!

00:02:55.217 --> 00:02:56.653
Okay. Take us to Romos.

00:02:56.687 --> 00:02:57.555
Aye!

00:02:58.524 --> 00:02:59.559
Hyunckel: It looks like
the princess will be

00:02:59.592 --> 00:03:01.395
leading the country into war.

00:03:02.031 --> 00:03:03.901
So... what should we do?

00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:05.505
I don't know.

00:03:05.538 --> 00:03:09.011
It doesn't seem like any of
you have fully recovered yet.

00:03:09.044 --> 00:03:10.682
Rest comes first.

00:03:10.715 --> 00:03:11.482
But...

00:03:11.516 --> 00:03:14.756
Shut up and obey!
I'm off to bed.

00:03:37.134 --> 00:03:39.405
Brokeena: Ah, that's enough.

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:40.741
Maam: Grand Master.

00:03:40.775 --> 00:03:43.412
Brokeena: It's time for you
to leave the mountain...

00:03:43.446 --> 00:03:47.287
And test the results of your
training at this tournament.

00:03:48.891 --> 00:03:50.460
Maam: You mean...

00:03:55.672 --> 00:03:58.644
Popp: I'm not myself without
this after all, right?

00:03:58.677 --> 00:04:01.182
Matoriv: Your clothes
look clean, too.

00:04:01.215 --> 00:04:04.556
Yep, Merle fixed
them up back in Teran.

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:06.693
She was so upset when
we were leaving...

00:04:06.727 --> 00:04:08.630
And she took really
good care of us

00:04:08.664 --> 00:04:10.568
the whole time
we were there.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.544
Hey, hang on a sec, you
think she has a thing for me?

00:04:16.613 --> 00:04:17.716
A-As if!

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:18.751
[awkward chuckle]

00:04:18.785 --> 00:04:21.355
Matoriv [thought]: What
an oblivious little brat

00:04:21.388 --> 00:04:23.293
wandering through the world...

00:04:23.326 --> 00:04:24.796
A waste of time...

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.637
Okay, Mentor. Time to
start on my training!

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.946
With my powered-up spells,
I bet I could blow away-

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.150
[frightened yelp]

00:04:35.183 --> 00:04:38.122
Interesting.
He pulled it off.

00:04:38.156 --> 00:04:39.392
Huh?

00:04:39.425 --> 00:04:40.761
Matoriv: We'll train later.

00:04:41.897 --> 00:04:43.834
Go and check on your friend.

00:04:48.711 --> 00:04:49.846
Dai!

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:53.119
Did you actually just cast
a Zapple spell by yourself?!

00:04:53.153 --> 00:04:58.229
Yeah! I think I can do it any
time - even without my crest.

00:04:58.262 --> 00:04:59.498
Check it out!

00:05:06.245 --> 00:05:08.617
Zapple!

00:05:11.288 --> 00:05:13.594
Whoa, awesome!

00:05:13.628 --> 00:05:16.566
Indeed. You've grown
strong, young Dai.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.040
He has, and that was nothing
compared to his real power.

00:05:20.073 --> 00:05:21.375
Just watch.

00:05:21.408 --> 00:05:25.818
Now, Dai... Show everyone
the power of your crest.

00:05:25.852 --> 00:05:29.358
Oh, you mean the power
of the Dragon Knight?!

00:05:29.392 --> 00:05:34.903
Wait right there, my boy!

00:05:34.936 --> 00:05:35.805
Dai: What's this?

00:05:35.838 --> 00:05:37.875
Baduck: A gift
from the princess.

00:05:38.877 --> 00:05:39.813
No weapon or armor

00:05:39.846 --> 00:05:42.885
can endure the full
fury of a Dragon Knight,

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:44.722
but these clothes
have been woven with

00:05:44.756 --> 00:05:47.929
special Papnican
cloth and technique.

00:05:47.963 --> 00:05:49.933
They should do the trick!

00:05:53.741 --> 00:05:54.742
Hang on...

00:05:58.283 --> 00:06:00.722
Dai: The Knife of Papnica...

00:06:00.755 --> 00:06:02.793
I thought it was destroyed.

00:06:02.826 --> 00:06:05.765
There are actually
three Knives of Papnica.

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:09.472
The one the princess gave
you was the Sun Knife.

00:06:09.506 --> 00:06:12.678
This one right
here is the Wind Knife.

00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:17.254
Oh yeah. The other one
had a red gem in it's hilt...

00:06:17.288 --> 00:06:19.057
But this new one
here is green.

00:06:19.091 --> 00:06:23.166
Now, the third one-
the Sea Knife - is also gone,

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.136
so take care of this one.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.878
You can't wield it when you're
using the power of your crest!

00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:30.046
Dai: Got it!

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:33.052
Alright. Now you should try
on those special clothes.

00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:49.586
Huh!

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:53.727
Ooh! A perfect fit,
and they suit you, too.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.601
Now, listen.
Something's in the works.

00:06:57.635 --> 00:07:01.009
The princess is strategizing
with the other leaders.

00:07:01.042 --> 00:07:03.747
Since she herself
can't help in combat,

00:07:03.781 --> 00:07:06.052
she felt that giving
you this equipment

00:07:06.085 --> 00:07:08.256
was the least she could do.

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:11.362
Leona... Thanks, again.

00:07:11.395 --> 00:07:14.101
Well... Shall we
get started, then?

00:07:15.103 --> 00:07:18.810
[roaring]

00:07:20.414 --> 00:07:21.215
Crocodine!

00:07:21.248 --> 00:07:22.450
Crocodine: Right.

00:07:29.164 --> 00:07:30.333
Oh, wow.

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:33.507
Is the crest's power helping
him cast a Levizoom spell?!

00:07:39.552 --> 00:07:40.922
Now that's fast.

00:07:40.955 --> 00:07:44.328
They're great.
The cloak feels so light!

00:07:44.361 --> 00:07:47.334
Crocodine:
Then how about this?

00:07:47.367 --> 00:07:49.872
Beast King Redemption Blast!

00:07:51.943 --> 00:07:53.714
Draconic Aura!

00:08:01.429 --> 00:08:02.665
Incredible!

00:08:03.834 --> 00:08:07.240
Well done. Even with
my best attack...

00:08:09.211 --> 00:08:10.514
[falling yell]

00:08:10.547 --> 00:08:11.750
-Popp: Hey!
-Crocodine: Dai!

00:08:25.077 --> 00:08:26.378
Popp: Boy, that was scary.

00:08:26.412 --> 00:08:28.282
But what made him
fall out of the sky?

00:08:28.316 --> 00:08:32.191
We mistakenly thought the power
of Dai's crest was limitless,

00:08:32.224 --> 00:08:35.196
but it does have a weakness.

00:08:35.229 --> 00:08:38.671
Crocodine: With all of his
Aura focused into his fist,

00:08:38.704 --> 00:08:41.777
his energy drains even faster.

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:45.450
Fighting over a longer period
of time could be disastrous.

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.522
So, you'll have to control it.

00:08:47.555 --> 00:08:50.126
Hyunckel: That's not
it's only weakness.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.128
Huh?

00:08:51.663 --> 00:08:54.334
You can't use weapons.

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:57.474
Hyunckel: Your fists will be
enough for a normal enemy,

00:08:57.508 --> 00:08:59.513
but against a
powerful one like Baran?

00:08:59.546 --> 00:09:01.549
You'll need some help.

00:09:02.685 --> 00:09:04.054
Ah, he's right...

00:09:04.088 --> 00:09:08.262
Popp: The Demon Dragon Blade.
Baran was able to use it.

00:09:10.601 --> 00:09:12.839
There's got to be another
sword like that one.

00:09:12.872 --> 00:09:15.812
Something a Dragon Knight won't
be able to break so easily.

00:09:15.845 --> 00:09:19.184
There's one out there, indeed.
The world's a big place.

00:09:19.217 --> 00:09:22.858
Legendary weapons are just
a little harder to find.

00:09:22.892 --> 00:09:26.666
For example; the Sword of
Champions must be one of them.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.369
Sword of Champions?

00:09:28.403 --> 00:09:30.173
What are you talking
about, old man?

00:09:30.206 --> 00:09:31.743
Oh, really? You haven't heard?

00:09:31.777 --> 00:09:34.347
The Romos Martial Arts
Tournament is starting soon

00:09:34.381 --> 00:09:35.785
Both: Martial
Arts Tournament?

00:09:35.818 --> 00:09:38.690
And the Sword of Champions
is the grand prize!

00:09:38.724 --> 00:09:40.494
Pretty exciting, isn't it?

00:09:40.528 --> 00:09:42.096
Both: What?!

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.569
Is that really true?
Is it?! Is it?!

00:09:44.602 --> 00:09:46.005
Really?! Are you sure?

00:09:46.038 --> 00:09:46.973
Baduck: It's true.

00:09:47.006 --> 00:09:50.246
Amy told me when she
came back from Romos!

00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:51.883
Both: That's it!

00:09:52.752 --> 00:09:54.154
The Sword of Champions?

00:09:54.188 --> 00:09:56.225
It's the prize for
the tournament, isn't it?

00:09:56.258 --> 00:09:59.699
Oh, that. I met with
King Romos for the princess.

00:09:59.733 --> 00:10:01.603
He's looking for
more soldiers...

00:10:02.739 --> 00:10:05.812
So, he's holding a
Martial Arts Tournament.

00:10:05.845 --> 00:10:07.715
Seems a bit silly, honestly.

00:10:08.349 --> 00:10:09.719
[amazed gasps]

00:10:10.854 --> 00:10:12.992
Amy: All fighting styles
and weapon-types are allowed.

00:10:13.025 --> 00:10:15.598
It says right here
that the winner...

00:10:15.631 --> 00:10:18.303
receives the legendary
Sword of Champions.

00:10:18.336 --> 00:10:19.672
Both: It is true!

00:10:19.706 --> 00:10:21.209
When is this thing?

00:10:21.242 --> 00:10:22.210
It's today.

00:10:22.243 --> 00:10:23.412
Both: It's today?!

00:10:23.446 --> 00:10:24.982
The first round's at noon.

00:10:25.016 --> 00:10:27.387
Dai: Noon? Then
there's still time.

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:28.557
Popp: Where is it?

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:30.528
It looks like they
built a Colosseum

00:10:30.561 --> 00:10:32.698
a short distance from
the Romos Castle.

00:10:32.731 --> 00:10:34.702
We can get there
with a Zoom spell.

00:10:34.736 --> 00:10:36.405
What are we waiting for?!

00:10:37.374 --> 00:10:38.309
Zoom!

00:10:39.846 --> 00:10:41.415
But - wait a minute!

00:10:46.092 --> 00:10:46.593
Mister!

00:10:46.626 --> 00:10:47.529
You? You're the...

00:10:47.562 --> 00:10:48.797
Hero!

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:50.902
Tell me - where's the
Martial Arts Tournament?!

00:10:50.935 --> 00:10:53.640
Str-Straight
down this road...

00:10:53.673 --> 00:10:55.377
Guard: Take the
path to the right.

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.181
-Thank you!
-Thanks!

00:10:57.214 --> 00:10:58.517
We might just make it.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:59.819
Popp: C'mon.

00:10:59.853 --> 00:11:02.291
Let's win this thing and
get the Sword of Champions!

00:11:02.324 --> 00:11:04.227
Yeah!

00:11:18.489 --> 00:11:19.726
Baduck: Oh my.

00:11:19.759 --> 00:11:22.264
I thought they were hasty
running off like that...

00:11:22.297 --> 00:11:25.069
I can't believe they're
already in Romos.

00:11:25.103 --> 00:11:28.076
Indeed. It's better than
waiting around here, though.

00:11:28.109 --> 00:11:31.649
Lady Amy. Princess
Leona's big strategy.

00:11:31.683 --> 00:11:33.854
What is it that she has
planned for everyone?

00:11:33.888 --> 00:11:37.060
I'm not yet at liberty
to discuss such things.

00:11:37.094 --> 00:11:38.229
You see...

00:11:38.262 --> 00:11:40.634
It's not just the Papnica
Troika who've been asked

00:11:40.668 --> 00:11:43.239
to gather the leaders
of the human kingdoms.

00:11:43.273 --> 00:11:44.809
The princess herself

00:11:44.842 --> 00:11:47.214
is traveling the
world in preparation.

00:11:47.247 --> 00:11:48.483
Interesting.

00:11:48.517 --> 00:11:51.790
Crocodine,
what are your plans?

00:11:51.823 --> 00:11:53.225
Well, in the meantime,

00:11:53.259 --> 00:11:56.365
I'm hoping that Baduck will
be able to repair my weapon.

00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:59.873
Then I'm afraid I
must apologize for this...

00:11:59.906 --> 00:12:01.643
I'm leaving to train.

00:12:01.676 --> 00:12:03.245
You? What for?

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:06.719
Hyunckel: Our recent encounter
with Baran taught me something.

00:12:06.753 --> 00:12:09.224
In battle, when beings
like the Dragon Knights

00:12:09.258 --> 00:12:11.930
are fighting using
their full strength,

00:12:11.963 --> 00:12:15.036
the damage is
horrific beyond belief.

00:12:16.305 --> 00:12:20.781
In his Dragonoid form, Baran
couldn't control his power.

00:12:20.815 --> 00:12:22.217
It made him into a monster

00:12:22.251 --> 00:12:25.189
capable of turning
against his own son.

00:12:27.795 --> 00:12:29.231
Up until now,

00:12:29.265 --> 00:12:33.540
I thought I had the ability to
win any fight that came my way.

00:12:33.574 --> 00:12:37.246
But strength alone is no
longer the path to victory.

00:12:41.857 --> 00:12:44.629
I promised Larhart when
he gave me this spear.

00:12:44.662 --> 00:12:47.267
A promise that I
fully intend to keep.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.807
To do so, I need to
change my approach.

00:12:50.841 --> 00:12:52.845
I can't stop him as I am.

00:12:52.879 --> 00:12:54.983
But... how will you train?

00:12:55.016 --> 00:12:56.853
I'm not adept with a spear.

00:12:56.887 --> 00:12:58.891
I never actually
thought I'd need it.

00:12:58.924 --> 00:13:01.829
But the Book of Avan
contains the secrets of

00:13:01.863 --> 00:13:04.636
the Avan Style
Spear Technique.

00:13:04.669 --> 00:13:06.339
Avan was a swordsman.

00:13:06.372 --> 00:13:09.411
You're saying he used
a spear, as well?

00:13:09.445 --> 00:13:12.483
Hyunckel: He was the master
of all fighting styles.

00:13:12.518 --> 00:13:17.059
Now I must study and follow the
same path that he did back then.

00:13:17.093 --> 00:13:21.001
So that I can learn to truly
wield the Dark Armor Spear.

00:13:21.034 --> 00:13:24.307
Crocodine: Wait. Shouldn't
you take the Book of Avan?

00:13:24.341 --> 00:13:26.980
Hyunckel: There's no need.
I've memorized it.

00:13:27.013 --> 00:13:30.755
Besides, it's a little too
precious for me to take.

00:13:30.788 --> 00:13:32.490
Dai and Popp should have it.

00:13:33.794 --> 00:13:35.096
Crocodine: Hyunckel...

00:13:36.431 --> 00:13:38.837
Take care of them.

00:13:38.871 --> 00:13:42.411
Alright, then. You can trust
Dai and Papnica with me.

00:13:42.444 --> 00:13:45.650
Don't you think he's being
a bit too hard on himself?

00:13:45.684 --> 00:13:47.053
Crocodine: He's
begun to realize

00:13:47.086 --> 00:13:49.525
his responsibility
as the eldest.

00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:53.265
The senior student of
the Disciples of Avan.

00:13:54.569 --> 00:13:55.637
Well, good luck to him.

00:13:55.671 --> 00:13:58.743
Do you think Dai will be
able to win that tournament?

00:13:58.777 --> 00:14:00.915
Oh, no. This says...

00:14:00.948 --> 00:14:03.052
Both: What? We're too late?!

00:14:03.085 --> 00:14:05.122
Preliminary fights
begin at noon,

00:14:05.156 --> 00:14:07.895
but registration
ends an hour before.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.736
Can't you do something?

00:14:11.769 --> 00:14:14.207
C'mon... We came all
the way from Papnica!

00:14:14.241 --> 00:14:17.614
Well... I know it's a
request from the Hero...

00:14:18.717 --> 00:14:20.520
And I'd like to help you...

00:14:21.657 --> 00:14:22.658
But rules are rules.

00:14:22.691 --> 00:14:24.563
Both: Oh, come on!

00:14:24.596 --> 00:14:26.332
[disappointed chirps]

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:28.604
Announcer: Preliminary
fights are starting.

00:14:28.637 --> 00:14:30.239
Please make
way to your seats.

00:14:30.273 --> 00:14:32.010
Woman: I wonder
who'll be fighting.

00:14:32.043 --> 00:14:33.446
[exasperated sigh]

00:14:33.479 --> 00:14:36.820
Dumb rules. We just wasted all
of our energy getting here!

00:14:36.853 --> 00:14:38.022
Whatever...

00:14:38.056 --> 00:14:39.959
How about we challenge
the winner afterwards

00:14:39.993 --> 00:14:41.228
and then kick their butt?

00:14:41.261 --> 00:14:43.165
-Does that really sound...
-What do you think?

00:14:43.198 --> 00:14:44.935
-...like what Heroes do?
-Sound good?!

00:14:46.004 --> 00:14:47.207
Let's go home.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.244
Just forget about
that silly sword.

00:14:49.277 --> 00:14:51.382
C'mon. Why don't we check
out the tournament?

00:14:51.415 --> 00:14:52.417
We came all this way.

00:14:52.451 --> 00:14:54.856
I mean, we might even
learn something, right?

00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:56.292
Yeah - no, thanks.

00:14:56.325 --> 00:14:58.563
No one interesting
will be fighting.

00:14:58.597 --> 00:15:01.234
Come on, they're
all amateurs.

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:04.675
Man: Hey, guys!
Get a load of this.

00:15:04.709 --> 00:15:06.579
There's a cute
girl fighting!

00:15:08.115 --> 00:15:11.188
But, hey, you never know-
we might learn something!

00:15:11.823 --> 00:15:12.991
[amused chuckle]

00:15:14.094 --> 00:15:15.496
-Wow, that's amazing!
-Keep it up. You can do it!

00:15:24.347 --> 00:15:25.449
[pained groan]

00:15:25.785 --> 00:15:28.155
[cheering]

00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:30.961
All right. Let's see
how cute she is!

00:16:03.392 --> 00:16:04.695
Unbelievable!

00:16:04.729 --> 00:16:06.131
Popp: Actually, let's go.

00:16:06.164 --> 00:16:08.837
I don't need to meet a girl
who's this freakishly strong.

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:11.174
To be honest,
it's pretty terrifying.

00:16:18.623 --> 00:16:21.228
[worried yell]

00:16:26.205 --> 00:16:29.077
I heard that,
Popp. You jerk!

00:16:32.584 --> 00:16:33.620
[amazed breath]

00:16:37.895 --> 00:16:40.199
[victorious chuckle]

00:16:40.232 --> 00:16:43.339
That's three minutes,
and fifteen seconds!

00:16:43.372 --> 00:16:45.877
The fighter Maam
wins by knockout!

00:16:45.911 --> 00:16:48.415
[cheering]

00:16:48.449 --> 00:16:51.221
MC: The next fight will
begin in ten minutes.

00:16:51.923 --> 00:16:53.092
Hey there, Maam!

00:16:53.125 --> 00:16:54.528
[delighted laugh]

00:16:54.561 --> 00:16:56.632
Dai, Gomechan!

00:16:57.935 --> 00:16:59.237
You did it.

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:01.609
You're actually in the
tournament as a martial artist-

00:17:01.642 --> 00:17:02.778
that's so great!

00:17:02.812 --> 00:17:04.648
That's right.
What a surprise!

00:17:04.682 --> 00:17:07.754
I didn't expect to run
into the three of you here.

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:09.992
Uh, Popp?

00:17:10.026 --> 00:17:11.829
Hey there, buddy...
What's wrong?

00:17:11.863 --> 00:17:15.236
Popp [thought]: Is it really
Maam? I can't be sure.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:17.173
It could be another fake.

00:17:22.317 --> 00:17:23.019
Okay.

00:17:23.052 --> 00:17:24.053
What?

00:17:24.889 --> 00:17:26.057
Huh?

00:17:26.926 --> 00:17:28.262
Let me take a
closer look at 'ya...

00:17:28.296 --> 00:17:31.301
Make sure you don't have
Zaboera's beady little eyes.

00:17:32.436 --> 00:17:34.140
Out of my face!

00:17:37.213 --> 00:17:40.152
Okay, I think she's
the real deal...

00:17:42.157 --> 00:17:43.793
I don't let just anyone-

00:17:49.505 --> 00:17:50.741
A Giant Rat!

00:17:50.774 --> 00:17:51.843
What's it doing here?!

00:17:51.877 --> 00:17:53.547
You got a problem with me?

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.819
The rules don't say a monster
can't enter the tournament!

00:17:58.055 --> 00:17:59.926
A giant talking rat?!

00:17:59.959 --> 00:18:01.595
E-Everybody - run!

00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:04.668
Ow! What are you doing?!

00:18:04.702 --> 00:18:06.271
I could ask you the same!

00:18:06.305 --> 00:18:10.313
You dare disrespect
Miss Maam, you creepy weirdo?!

00:18:10.346 --> 00:18:12.652
No! I'm not doing anything!

00:18:12.685 --> 00:18:14.420
Come on, Chiu. Enough.

00:18:15.557 --> 00:18:16.157
Right!

00:18:16.191 --> 00:18:17.595
I've told you about them.

00:18:17.628 --> 00:18:20.600
These are my friends Dai and
Popp. And of course, Gomechan.

00:18:20.634 --> 00:18:23.941
Huh? You mean this
is the Hero's party?

00:18:23.974 --> 00:18:25.844
No way.

00:18:25.878 --> 00:18:27.280
More like "yes way"!

00:18:27.313 --> 00:18:28.683
You're just a rat-

00:18:28.717 --> 00:18:31.556
I'm going to roast you over
a spit, you little monster!

00:18:31.589 --> 00:18:32.691
Slow down, Popp.

00:18:32.725 --> 00:18:35.698
He's a new friend of mine.
Give him a break.

00:18:35.731 --> 00:18:38.570
This little guy?!
Ratty here is your friend?!

00:18:38.603 --> 00:18:39.437
That's right.

00:18:40.674 --> 00:18:45.449
Maam: I was trained by Grand
Master Brokeena; the Holy Fist.

00:18:45.482 --> 00:18:47.921
This is the Karate Rat, Chiu.

00:18:47.954 --> 00:18:49.826
He was Brokeena's
other student.

00:18:49.859 --> 00:18:50.927
Uh-huh.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.764
A Karate Rat?!

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:54.033
Huh.

00:18:54.067 --> 00:18:57.808
Well, now. This is the Hero Dai
I've been hearing so much about.

00:18:57.842 --> 00:19:01.081
You know what? You're
smaller than I thought.

00:19:01.114 --> 00:19:01.950
Uh... I'm small?

00:19:01.983 --> 00:19:03.786
And now for the next fight!

00:19:07.861 --> 00:19:09.097
Put your hands together for

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:12.136
the Wrestler Gomez
versus Karate Rat Chiu!

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:15.042
Fighters; please
enter the ring.

00:19:15.076 --> 00:19:16.245
[cheering]

00:19:16.278 --> 00:19:19.417
Just sit back and
observe a real fighter!

00:19:19.918 --> 00:19:21.054
Don't you worry.

00:19:21.087 --> 00:19:23.961
I'll make quick work
of this one, Miss Maam.

00:19:23.994 --> 00:19:25.931
You; the creepy Mage!

00:19:25.964 --> 00:19:30.372
Don't you go anywhere, you
got that? We'll talk later.

00:19:31.709 --> 00:19:32.844
That little...

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.550
-[angry mumbling]
-Sorry about that.

00:19:35.583 --> 00:19:37.854
He's really great when
you get to know him.

00:19:37.888 --> 00:19:39.892
What his, uh, whole deal?

00:19:41.195 --> 00:19:43.165
Maam: He used to
be an evil monster.

00:19:43.198 --> 00:19:45.235
He attacked a nearby village.

00:19:45.269 --> 00:19:47.273
Grand Master
Brokeena captured him

00:19:47.306 --> 00:19:50.146
and then put him
through training.

00:19:50.179 --> 00:19:52.383
His heart got stronger,
eventually he became

00:19:52.416 --> 00:19:54.988
immune to the
Dark Lord's will.

00:19:55.022 --> 00:19:57.260
Then he learned
to speak on his own.

00:19:57.293 --> 00:19:59.330
He sounds impressive...

00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:02.270
So what are you
two doing here?

00:20:02.304 --> 00:20:05.476
Well, um, we battled
the Dragon Legion.

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:06.245
Huh?!

00:20:06.278 --> 00:20:07.280
Popp [thought]: Okay.

00:20:07.313 --> 00:20:08.684
We'll have to
explain everything

00:20:08.717 --> 00:20:09.685
that happened gently,

00:20:09.719 --> 00:20:12.423
or the shock might
be too much for her.

00:20:12.456 --> 00:20:14.427
Dai: It was quite the ordeal.

00:20:14.461 --> 00:20:16.031
Popp: Hey... Dai...

00:20:16.064 --> 00:20:18.101
And Popp even died once!

00:20:18.135 --> 00:20:19.004
Maam: [shocked gasp]

00:20:19.037 --> 00:20:20.807
H-Hey! Pipe down!

00:20:22.978 --> 00:20:25.015
Maam: Care to explain?

00:20:26.986 --> 00:20:28.455
Well... Uh...

00:20:32.129 --> 00:20:34.535
Gomez: Huh...
That's different.

00:20:34.568 --> 00:20:38.209
It's not every day you see a
monster wearing fighting gear.

00:20:38.242 --> 00:20:39.477
[chuckling]

00:20:39.511 --> 00:20:41.181
Well, this
"monster" is going to

00:20:41.215 --> 00:20:43.219
mop the floor
with you, meathead!

00:20:43.252 --> 00:20:44.655
What did you say?!

00:20:45.924 --> 00:20:49.532
If I can defeat this brainless
thug and show off how cool I am,

00:20:49.565 --> 00:20:53.472
then I'm sure Miss Maam's
heart will finally be mine.

00:20:56.846 --> 00:20:59.451
Maam: So that's why you
need the Sword of Champions.

00:20:59.484 --> 00:21:02.824
Yeah. And you really
think you can win this?

00:21:04.127 --> 00:21:08.904
I do... but there's no way
I'm going to accept that sword.

00:21:08.937 --> 00:21:09.771
Both: Huh?!

00:21:10.974 --> 00:21:14.848
I'm not going to help you
kill your own father. No way.

00:21:16.284 --> 00:21:18.355
M-Maam, I...

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:20.459
Popp: But...

00:21:26.939 --> 00:21:28.108
I say...

00:21:28.142 --> 00:21:31.682
This tournament has been quite
the success, Mister Zamza.

00:21:31.716 --> 00:21:36.157
Zamza: Yes. And it's all
thanks to you, Your Majesty.

00:21:36.191 --> 00:21:37.426
King Romos: No, no.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.696
Gathering strong fighters

00:21:38.729 --> 00:21:41.569
to increase our country's
strength was your idea.

00:21:41.602 --> 00:21:43.640
I merely agreed to it.

00:21:43.673 --> 00:21:47.213
Let us just hope we
can gather many of them.

00:21:47.246 --> 00:21:50.753
Zamza: Why, of course,
Your Majesty.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:59.805
After all, that is
our objective.

00:23:37.867 --> 00:23:39.370
Narrator: Dai
and Popp marvel at

00:23:39.404 --> 00:23:41.809
Maam's new mastery
of the Martial Arts.

00:23:41.842 --> 00:23:44.281
With the outcome of
the tournament uncertain

00:23:44.314 --> 00:23:46.484
and the Sword of
Champions still to be won,

00:23:46.519 --> 00:23:48.723
the pair watch
on in anticipation.

00:23:48.756 --> 00:23:51.796
But as the competition
moves to the final round,

00:23:51.829 --> 00:23:56.170
an insidious plot begins to take
motion behind the scenes...

00:23:56.204 --> 00:23:57.708
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:57.741 --> 00:24:00.379
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,
