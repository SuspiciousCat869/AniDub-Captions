WEBVTT

00:02:05.618 --> 00:02:07.288
Popp: What's going
on in there...

00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:08.891
What are they doing?!

00:02:08.924 --> 00:02:10.327
What does it look like, Popp?

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.300
The very air is burning
with their ferocity.

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:14.736
Are you saying that...

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.842
this heat is a product of how
intensely they're fighting?

00:02:17.876 --> 00:02:19.412
That seems to be the case.

00:02:19.445 --> 00:02:21.148
It's highly concentrated aura.

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:23.052
I don't think there's
any stopping them now.

00:02:23.086 --> 00:02:24.756
I tried to talk
them out of it,

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.061
but we barely escaped
without getting burned.

00:02:27.094 --> 00:02:28.096
[agreeing chirp]

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.767
I still don't understand.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.735
Look at this. I mean,

00:02:30.768 --> 00:02:33.206
how does this sort of
thing even happen?

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.646
Vearn: The legend...
the Battle of True Dragons...

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.350
Piroro: What's that,
Your Majesty?

00:02:38.383 --> 00:02:39.653
You don't recall?

00:02:39.686 --> 00:02:42.625
The Underworld's
most infamous battle,

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:46.066
and now it's being
recreated right before us.

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.369
Killvearn: Enlighten
us, great Dark King.

00:02:50.306 --> 00:02:53.514
Many eons ago...

00:02:53.547 --> 00:02:57.154
The two most powerful
Dragons inhabiting

00:02:57.187 --> 00:03:01.229
the Underworld challenged
each other to a duel.

00:03:01.262 --> 00:03:02.398
They sought to determine

00:03:02.431 --> 00:03:05.504
which one of them was
the stronger being.

00:03:05.538 --> 00:03:09.078
[snarling]

00:03:09.111 --> 00:03:11.984
Velzar, the Abyss Dragon...

00:03:12.017 --> 00:03:14.589
...or Vorikus,
the Lightning Dragon.

00:03:15.124 --> 00:03:16.092
[roaring]

00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:18.229
Evenly matched as they were,

00:03:18.263 --> 00:03:19.700
their clash was
more destructive

00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:22.773
than anything the realm
had ever witnessed.

00:03:22.806 --> 00:03:27.414
Their Auras, fiery breath,
and Magic Power collided,

00:03:27.448 --> 00:03:31.222
creating a field of energy that
super-heated the battleground-

00:03:31.255 --> 00:03:34.461
laying waste to all that
stood in their path.

00:03:34.495 --> 00:03:36.499
The tempest had such
incredible force

00:03:36.534 --> 00:03:38.571
that it brought
ruin to any creature

00:03:38.604 --> 00:03:41.943
who made the error of
getting too close.

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:45.417
But still the battle raged on,

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.822
until all that
remained was ash.

00:03:47.856 --> 00:03:50.795
When this ultimate duel
of power came to an end,

00:03:50.828 --> 00:03:52.030
and the ashes settled...

00:03:52.064 --> 00:03:57.508
Vorikus was no more, and
Velzar claimed his victory.

00:03:57.542 --> 00:03:59.278
This was how he
earned his title

00:03:59.311 --> 00:04:01.516
as the Dragon King
of the Abyss.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.955
Ever since, their
quarrel has been known as

00:04:03.988 --> 00:04:05.725
the Battle of True Dragons.

00:04:05.758 --> 00:04:07.763
It is revered throughout
the Underworld

00:04:07.796 --> 00:04:11.837
as the most extraordinary
duel in history.

00:04:11.871 --> 00:04:13.440
[delighted chuckle]

00:04:13.473 --> 00:04:16.713
So pay close attention
now, Killvearn...

00:04:16.747 --> 00:04:19.953
This isn't an event that
one witnesses every day.

00:04:19.987 --> 00:04:23.293
Vearn: These two are locked in
a similar field of destruction.

00:04:23.326 --> 00:04:24.829
For such an event
to take place,

00:04:24.863 --> 00:04:28.336
both sides must be extremely
powerful, and their tactics;

00:04:28.369 --> 00:04:29.639
evenly matched.

00:04:29.673 --> 00:04:31.577
To think that Lord
Hadlar and the Hero

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.982
would put on such
an impressive show...

00:04:34.015 --> 00:04:36.385
What a welcome surprise.

00:04:36.418 --> 00:04:37.522
They're both giving this fight

00:04:37.555 --> 00:04:39.491
all the power
they can summon...

00:04:39.526 --> 00:04:41.296
That energy must
be spilling over

00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:42.666
and creating this
heat surrounding them.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.669
Popp: How can you
be so calm right now?

00:04:44.703 --> 00:04:47.140
If Dai's in trouble,
don't you think we should be,

00:04:47.174 --> 00:04:48.744
y'know, helping him?

00:04:51.884 --> 00:04:52.986
What?

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.087
We don't have a say.

00:04:54.121 --> 00:04:56.860
As you can see, nothing
can get through that field.

00:04:56.893 --> 00:04:58.030
It's as if...

00:04:58.063 --> 00:04:59.165
their collective will is

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:01.469
preventing anyone
from interrupting them.

00:05:01.504 --> 00:05:03.373
At least, that's my guess.

00:05:03.406 --> 00:05:05.945
But, then... why isn't
Dai using his sword?

00:05:05.978 --> 00:05:08.183
Hadlar isn't using his either.

00:05:08.216 --> 00:05:10.454
Maybe they can't use
them inside the field.

00:05:10.487 --> 00:05:11.523
Since it appeared,

00:05:11.556 --> 00:05:12.992
they've been fighting
hand-to-hand.

00:05:13.025 --> 00:05:15.330
Or perhaps they both
realize that once they draw

00:05:15.363 --> 00:05:17.034
their weapons...

00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:19.539
there won't be
any turning back.

00:05:29.292 --> 00:05:31.462
[roaring]

00:05:32.297 --> 00:05:42.284
[fighting grunts]

00:05:42.317 --> 00:05:47.763
[fighting grunts]

00:05:47.796 --> 00:05:48.964
No, Dai!

00:05:51.436 --> 00:05:52.839
I'm not standing by.

00:05:52.872 --> 00:05:56.312
I can blow away all this heat
with one blast of my Medroa.

00:05:56.345 --> 00:05:57.949
Hadlar won't know
what hit him-

00:05:58.551 --> 00:05:59.485
What are you doing?

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:00.921
You can't, Popp.

00:06:00.955 --> 00:06:02.559
This duel belongs to them.

00:06:02.592 --> 00:06:04.829
Enough! Save the platitudes.

00:06:04.862 --> 00:06:05.865
Look at them!

00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:08.202
Just standing there
is draining their stamina-

00:06:08.235 --> 00:06:09.171
we both know it.

00:06:09.204 --> 00:06:10.507
Dai might be a Dragon Knight,

00:06:10.541 --> 00:06:13.046
but Hadlar's easily
twice his size.

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:14.014
He's a monster.

00:06:14.047 --> 00:06:16.085
If they're fighting to
tire each other out,

00:06:16.118 --> 00:06:18.189
it's obvious who's
going to win.

00:06:18.222 --> 00:06:20.294
And I don't care
if it's unfair or not.

00:06:20.327 --> 00:06:21.830
He needs help, I'm helping.

00:06:22.364 --> 00:06:24.368
Leona: Hold on, Popp.

00:06:24.402 --> 00:06:25.705
Oh, not you too, Princess.

00:06:25.738 --> 00:06:28.410
Dai wants this duel.
He said so himself.

00:06:28.443 --> 00:06:30.013
We shouldn't interfere.

00:06:30.047 --> 00:06:31.516
He knows what he's doing.

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.887
No, he's just being naive.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.128
Hadlar's egging him on,
and he's taking the bait.

00:06:37.161 --> 00:06:38.396
But isn't the fact...

00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:41.736
That he's even doing it -
what makes Dai, our Dai?

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:43.841
"O-Our Dai"?

00:06:43.874 --> 00:06:44.810
You see, I...

00:06:44.843 --> 00:06:46.847
I've been thinking
about it a lot...

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.953
About what the power of
Dai's soul could be.

00:06:49.987 --> 00:06:52.457
At first, I thought that
it must've been Courage,

00:06:52.491 --> 00:06:55.296
but that wound up being
the gift of your soul.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.967
Y-Yeah...

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.302
Right.

00:06:58.336 --> 00:07:01.643
If that's the case,
what is his power?

00:07:01.676 --> 00:07:03.781
Actually, you
just mentioned it.

00:07:03.814 --> 00:07:07.655
If I'm right, then Dai's
true power is his naivety.

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:09.759
Huh? How is that a power?

00:07:09.793 --> 00:07:11.930
Kindness and innocence
are virtues;

00:07:11.963 --> 00:07:14.434
they only come
from a pure heart.

00:07:14.468 --> 00:07:17.274
Yes... that has to be it.

00:07:17.307 --> 00:07:18.744
[agreeing chirp]

00:07:19.946 --> 00:07:21.650
Leona: Dai was raised among
monsters on Dermline Island,

00:07:21.683 --> 00:07:24.021
so he grew up without
learning to discriminate.

00:07:24.054 --> 00:07:26.158
He's never seen differences
as a bad thing...

00:07:26.191 --> 00:07:29.364
It's just in his nature
to treat everyone equally;

00:07:29.398 --> 00:07:30.934
no matter the cost.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:35.043
That's his greatest
strength, isn't it?

00:07:35.076 --> 00:07:38.149
I mean, it's the reason
we became friends, after all.

00:07:38.182 --> 00:07:41.656
And... that's why Hyunckel
and Crocodine joined us.

00:07:42.626 --> 00:07:44.695
Leona: The only reason
we're all here right now

00:07:44.729 --> 00:07:46.800
is thanks to the
power of Dai's soul-

00:07:46.834 --> 00:07:48.737
because of his pure heart.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.177
So if Dai could sense...

00:07:52.211 --> 00:07:53.780
anything within Hadlar...

00:07:53.814 --> 00:07:57.354
that made him accept
this duel, whatever it was...

00:07:57.387 --> 00:07:59.225
it's our duty to respect that.

00:07:59.258 --> 00:08:00.928
We'll have to trust him.

00:08:02.464 --> 00:08:03.934
I might be wrong...

00:08:03.967 --> 00:08:06.506
but something
tells me I'm not.

00:08:13.452 --> 00:08:15.925
You had enough?

00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.663
Dai [thought]: There's no
way I'll beat him like this.

00:08:19.064 --> 00:08:20.267
Fine, then.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:24.041
I'll... I'll have to use my
strongest attack against him.

00:08:28.083 --> 00:08:28.950
Dai!

00:08:28.984 --> 00:08:30.219
His sword!

00:08:35.565 --> 00:08:37.133
Hadlar: [chuckling]

00:08:37.167 --> 00:08:39.506
Ah, yes. There's the look.

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:40.775
It's like clockwork.

00:08:40.808 --> 00:08:42.945
Whenever you're about to
do something astonishing,

00:08:42.979 --> 00:08:45.249
that look comes
over your face.

00:08:47.087 --> 00:08:51.028
To be honest, it's become my
favorite expression of yours.

00:09:06.325 --> 00:09:10.366
Hyunckel: This is it. The
final clash is about to begin.

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:12.672
This next attack
decides who wins.

00:09:12.705 --> 00:09:14.642
Oh, you're a Seer now, too.

00:09:14.676 --> 00:09:16.479
How could you
possibly know that?

00:09:16.513 --> 00:09:17.849
The field...

00:09:17.882 --> 00:09:20.587
If I'm right,
then I believe...

00:09:21.289 --> 00:09:22.825
When this duel ends,

00:09:22.858 --> 00:09:24.696
the energy surrounding
the battlefield

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.067
will side with the victor.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.035
Killvearn: Really?

00:09:29.305 --> 00:09:33.145
This superheated field they've
created is unstable, you see.

00:09:33.179 --> 00:09:37.354
It hasn't collapsed because
their energies are balanced.

00:09:37.387 --> 00:09:38.690
As long as that's the case,

00:09:38.724 --> 00:09:42.030
the field will continue
to grow in strength...

00:09:42.064 --> 00:09:46.005
However, the moment one
of them tips that balance...

00:09:46.038 --> 00:09:48.142
all of the energy
will concentrate

00:09:48.176 --> 00:09:51.415
and flow directly
to the weaker side.

00:09:51.448 --> 00:09:56.025
And by the weaker side...
I mean the loser, of course.

00:09:56.058 --> 00:09:58.664
That's the most dangerous
and compelling part

00:09:58.697 --> 00:10:01.636
of the Battle of True Dragons.

00:10:01.669 --> 00:10:04.809
When either of them
delivers the finishing blow,

00:10:04.843 --> 00:10:07.781
the field collapses,
and only one of these warriors

00:10:07.815 --> 00:10:10.386
will be left
standing in its wake.

00:10:11.757 --> 00:10:13.760
Then... the other, well,

00:10:13.794 --> 00:10:17.267
they'll face the same
fate as the Dragon Vorikus.

00:10:17.301 --> 00:10:19.071
Killvearn: Ooo, how scary.

00:10:19.104 --> 00:10:22.077
Personally, I'd never
agree to a duel like that.

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:23.914
Yep. Scary, scary!

00:10:23.947 --> 00:10:26.753
In this case, it's Dai
who has the disadvantage,

00:10:26.787 --> 00:10:29.391
and it grows the
longer this goes on.

00:10:29.424 --> 00:10:30.794
Knowing Hadlar,

00:10:30.828 --> 00:10:33.934
his finishing attack will
be the Ultra Combustion Slash.

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:35.772
Killvearn: But as
for little Dai...

00:10:35.805 --> 00:10:38.644
his greatest attack
is the Avan Strash-

00:10:38.677 --> 00:10:40.213
especially when combined with

00:10:40.246 --> 00:10:43.152
his Draconic Aura or
a spell of some kind...

00:10:43.186 --> 00:10:46.191
And if the strongest
incantation he knows is Zapple,

00:10:46.224 --> 00:10:49.498
then his Magic Sword isn't
a real threat here. Correct?

00:10:49.532 --> 00:10:52.539
Vearn: Between Avan Strash
and Ultra Combustion Slash,

00:10:52.572 --> 00:10:55.143
there's no question
which is stronger...

00:10:55.176 --> 00:10:57.314
Although, that is not
the sort of thing

00:10:57.347 --> 00:10:59.619
the Hero would overlook.

00:10:59.652 --> 00:11:02.758
I wonder what the boy
is thinking, then?

00:11:18.891 --> 00:11:21.461
Hadlar: The Avan Strash...

00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:41.736
Hadlar: The Avan Strash...

00:11:41.769 --> 00:11:43.807
How predictable.

00:11:43.841 --> 00:11:46.245
That attack once
cost me my life.

00:11:46.278 --> 00:11:49.786
And now even after Avan's
demise, it goes on...

00:11:49.819 --> 00:11:53.560
to be wielded by his
equally pathetic successor.

00:11:53.593 --> 00:11:55.196
I must admit, Dai.

00:11:55.229 --> 00:11:58.469
It is a rather fitting
bookend to our conflict...

00:11:58.504 --> 00:12:00.874
[laughing]

00:12:00.908 --> 00:12:02.779
But this time you
don't stand a chance

00:12:02.812 --> 00:12:04.883
of winning with that attack!

00:12:04.916 --> 00:12:06.853
And once you've been beaten,

00:12:06.886 --> 00:12:09.391
all this chaos
surrounding us...

00:12:09.424 --> 00:12:10.327
Oh, I get it.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.998
Whoever loses this
round is getting hit...

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:15.436
With the full
force of this heat.

00:12:15.469 --> 00:12:18.209
Then you realize
what happens next.

00:12:18.242 --> 00:12:20.380
But I'm not gonna - no -

00:12:20.413 --> 00:12:22.952
Avan Strash won't fail me now.

00:12:24.154 --> 00:12:26.191
Because I've been practicing...

00:12:26.225 --> 00:12:29.766
And I've got something that can
defeat the Dark King himself.

00:12:29.799 --> 00:12:33.674
This is an Avan Strash
you've never seen before!

00:12:33.707 --> 00:12:34.509
W-What?!

00:12:34.542 --> 00:12:35.644
A new type of Strash?

00:12:35.677 --> 00:12:37.748
It must be the attack
he came up with

00:12:37.781 --> 00:12:39.084
while he was
training with Nova.

00:12:39.117 --> 00:12:40.787
I was really
hoping to save this

00:12:40.821 --> 00:12:42.558
until I faced
off with King Vearn.

00:12:42.591 --> 00:12:44.494
But it seems like
if I lose here,

00:12:44.528 --> 00:12:46.265
then I won't
get the chance.

00:12:46.298 --> 00:12:49.171
So! You get to
try it first, Hadlar!

00:12:49.204 --> 00:12:50.173
Is that so?

00:12:50.206 --> 00:12:51.743
Well, you've
never been one to

00:12:51.777 --> 00:12:54.381
bluff your way out
of trouble before...

00:12:54.414 --> 00:12:56.252
Go ahead. I'm intrigued.

00:12:56.285 --> 00:13:00.359
Show me this new
Avan Strash of yours.

00:13:00.393 --> 00:13:02.463
But if it doesn't
live up to the hype,

00:13:02.497 --> 00:13:06.304
then my mighty blow will
shatter it - along with you!

00:13:07.842 --> 00:13:09.144
[struggling grunts]

00:13:09.177 --> 00:13:10.080
[worried chirps]

00:13:10.113 --> 00:13:12.450
Gome's right. We should
get further away.

00:13:12.484 --> 00:13:13.920
What? Don't be ridiculous.

00:13:13.954 --> 00:13:16.492
We can't leave Dai
at a time like this.

00:13:16.526 --> 00:13:18.195
Then at least get down!

00:13:35.797 --> 00:13:37.668
Here it comes...

00:13:37.702 --> 00:13:39.237
I hope you're ready!

00:13:39.271 --> 00:13:41.709
Hadlar [thought]: His stance
looks almost the same...

00:13:41.743 --> 00:13:44.381
Though it's slightly
lower than usual.

00:13:45.584 --> 00:13:49.825
Avan Strash... Arrow!

00:13:49.859 --> 00:13:51.495
Popp [thought]: Wait.
That's his new Strash?

00:13:51.529 --> 00:13:53.967
Hyunckel [thought]: It's
just like the normal one.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.169
Hadlar [thought]:
Is that all?

00:13:55.202 --> 00:13:57.207
He's made it look
like an arrow?

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.209
That fool...

00:13:58.242 --> 00:13:59.913
It's still little
more than a breeze

00:13:59.946 --> 00:14:03.118
compared to my
Ultra Combustion Slash...

00:14:03.854 --> 00:14:06.358
What a disappointment!

00:14:06.392 --> 00:14:07.929
Okay, now.

00:14:07.962 --> 00:14:10.901
Avan... Strash... Break!

00:14:13.807 --> 00:14:14.975
But... How?!

00:14:16.011 --> 00:14:18.617
Popp: Are you seeing this?
He's catching up...

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:20.086
Maam: With the first Strash!

00:14:20.119 --> 00:14:21.923
No, no! Why you little-

00:14:23.192 --> 00:14:25.697
[roaring]

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:30.140
Avan Strash...

00:14:30.173 --> 00:14:31.475
Cross!

00:14:32.545 --> 00:14:37.988
[snarling]

00:14:45.771 --> 00:14:47.206
Nova: That's Dai!

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.547
He finally let his new
super attack out of the bag.

00:15:06.278 --> 00:15:08.817
The Battle of True Dragons...

00:15:08.851 --> 00:15:11.388
Has decided upon a victor.

00:15:11.421 --> 00:15:14.494
Yes, he did it! Dai
actually pulled it off.

00:15:14.528 --> 00:15:15.363
Did you see that?

00:15:15.396 --> 00:15:17.768
That new attack
was unbelievable.

00:15:17.801 --> 00:15:18.970
What a champ!

00:15:19.003 --> 00:15:20.373
Leona: Unbelievable is right.

00:15:20.406 --> 00:15:22.945
I see why he and Nova
were so excited.

00:15:22.979 --> 00:15:26.653
The Avan Strash
Cross... Incredible.

00:15:26.686 --> 00:15:27.888
Impressive.

00:15:27.922 --> 00:15:29.491
The Arrow Type
enables the user to

00:15:29.525 --> 00:15:31.262
fire an Aura from
a distance, right?

00:15:31.295 --> 00:15:32.965
And the Break Type
is when you

00:15:32.999 --> 00:15:34.569
charge the enemy
at full power...

00:15:34.602 --> 00:15:37.140
But to combine them both,
well, it's unheard of...

00:15:37.173 --> 00:15:38.811
Combining the two, huh?

00:15:38.844 --> 00:15:40.446
Wait, what are you
talking about, Hyunckel?

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.684
I mean when he
uses the Break Type

00:15:42.718 --> 00:15:44.321
and catches up with
his Arrow Type,

00:15:44.354 --> 00:15:47.326
he's able to detonate both
Strashes simultaneously,

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.432
unleashing their power
at the moment of impact.

00:15:50.466 --> 00:15:52.371
The upward blast of
the Arrow Type

00:15:52.404 --> 00:15:54.340
and the downward blast
of the Break Type

00:15:54.374 --> 00:15:57.481
cross right before they
both hit the enemy's chest.

00:15:57.515 --> 00:16:00.152
If I had to guess,
the combined force...

00:16:00.186 --> 00:16:03.192
is five times greater
than a normal Strash.

00:16:03.226 --> 00:16:04.762
Five times greater?!

00:16:04.795 --> 00:16:07.333
Hyunckel: But timing both
techniques so perfectly...

00:16:07.366 --> 00:16:09.370
it would require
tremendous skill-

00:16:09.404 --> 00:16:11.576
along with instincts
like no other.

00:16:11.609 --> 00:16:14.181
To predict an enemy's
movements like that,

00:16:14.214 --> 00:16:17.353
while coordinating two
strikes is beyond even me.

00:16:17.386 --> 00:16:20.226
Only Dai could carry
out such a super attack.

00:16:20.259 --> 00:16:22.731
Yeah, "super attack"
sounds like his thing.

00:16:22.764 --> 00:16:26.104
The catch is, it must have
used up all of his Aura.

00:16:26.137 --> 00:16:28.075
[proud chuckle]

00:16:28.108 --> 00:16:31.381
Maam: After all this time
Hadlar's finished, isn't he?

00:16:31.415 --> 00:16:33.553
Hyunckel: That's right.
There's no way he survived.

00:16:33.586 --> 00:16:36.325
All the energy that was
surrounding them has vanished.

00:16:36.358 --> 00:16:38.095
And if I'm not
mistaken, then...

00:16:38.128 --> 00:16:40.467
It must have hit him
alongside Dai's attack.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.938
No one could withstand
a blast like that.

00:16:42.972 --> 00:16:45.476
All right, Dai! Well done!

00:16:50.854 --> 00:16:52.558
Oh, no. Watch out!
He's still...

00:16:53.225 --> 00:16:56.098
[furious roaring]

00:16:56.131 --> 00:16:57.100
[shocked gasps]

00:16:57.133 --> 00:16:58.435
Hyunckel [thought]:
Impossible!

00:16:58.469 --> 00:16:59.638
No!

00:17:01.876 --> 00:17:03.378
[pained yell]

00:17:08.488 --> 00:17:10.092
Popp: D-Dai?!

00:17:10.126 --> 00:17:11.228
Hyunckel: This can't be...

00:17:11.262 --> 00:17:13.298
No matter how strong
Hadlar's will is,

00:17:13.332 --> 00:17:15.069
it shouldn't make
any difference now.

00:17:15.102 --> 00:17:17.574
After that bout,
neither of them could have

00:17:17.608 --> 00:17:19.210
even a shred of Aura left.

00:17:19.243 --> 00:17:21.515
Where does he get
such strength?

00:17:27.961 --> 00:17:29.865
Hyunckel: A... A Life Blade?!

00:17:29.898 --> 00:17:30.901
Both: A what?!

00:17:30.934 --> 00:17:32.237
Hyunckel:
It's one of the most

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:33.606
dangerous techniques of all-

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.478
he's converting his own
life-force into a sword.

00:17:36.512 --> 00:17:39.652
Even though he knows full
well what it'll cost him!

00:17:39.686 --> 00:17:41.121
Dai!

00:17:42.825 --> 00:17:44.160
We've got your back!

00:17:44.194 --> 00:17:46.966
Hadlar [thought]: So they've
defeated my Royal Guard.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.173
I'm sure it was
a valiant fight.

00:17:50.206 --> 00:17:54.381
Hym... Albinass... Sigma...

00:17:54.414 --> 00:17:57.855
You all did very well.
You were mighty.

00:17:57.888 --> 00:18:01.763
I shall thank you properly when
I join you in the afterlife.

00:18:01.796 --> 00:18:05.571
In hindsight, the Dark Army's
Six Legion Commanders

00:18:05.604 --> 00:18:07.841
were just as mighty...

00:18:07.875 --> 00:18:09.410
But the reason
they weren't able to

00:18:09.444 --> 00:18:12.116
defeat the Disciples
of Avan was me...

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:14.253
It's because,
as their commander,

00:18:14.287 --> 00:18:16.491
I offered them
nothing to fight for

00:18:16.525 --> 00:18:19.732
but greed and
self-preservation.

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:21.401
I see that now.

00:18:24.642 --> 00:18:26.746
The fact that
you all came together

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.217
and risked your
lives for me...

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.890
That's all the proof
I need to know that I was

00:18:31.923 --> 00:18:33.392
able to reach new heights...

00:18:33.425 --> 00:18:36.365
to have even a brief
taste of greatness...

00:18:36.398 --> 00:18:38.637
At least, at the
end of all this...

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:42.511
I was blessed to
have such loyal servants.

00:18:46.017 --> 00:18:47.387
Now it's my turn.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.759
I shall repay your loyalty...

00:18:49.792 --> 00:18:52.864
With one last strike
to wipe out our enemy.

00:18:52.898 --> 00:18:54.334
Popp [thought]:
This is bad...

00:18:54.368 --> 00:18:57.808
It feels like Hadlar's will is
totally overpowering Dai's here.

00:18:57.841 --> 00:19:00.580
Even that super attack
wasn't enough to stop him,

00:19:00.613 --> 00:19:02.985
and now he's gonna
want payback.

00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:05.089
I can sense that
the next strike contains

00:19:05.123 --> 00:19:07.962
the life force of
the Royal Guard, as well.

00:19:07.995 --> 00:19:10.299
If any of us get hit,
it's all over!

00:19:10.333 --> 00:19:11.870
Dai, hang on. I'll-

00:19:11.903 --> 00:19:13.673
No, don't! Just wait!

00:19:15.944 --> 00:19:17.547
Dai: This is
between me and him.

00:19:17.581 --> 00:19:20.052
I won't forgive anyone
who gets in the way...

00:19:20.086 --> 00:19:21.756
Not even you, Popp.

00:19:23.827 --> 00:19:25.496
For this battle...

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.102
For just this one battle...

00:19:28.135 --> 00:19:31.275
I need you to let me...
fight it alone.

00:19:31.308 --> 00:19:33.245
Do I make myself clear?

00:19:34.414 --> 00:19:35.416
D-Don't be an idiot!

00:19:35.449 --> 00:19:36.953
You know that you don't have

00:19:36.986 --> 00:19:39.190
enough strength
to do this alone.

00:19:39.224 --> 00:19:41.495
That last attack burned
out all of your Aura...

00:19:41.529 --> 00:19:42.130
And being stubborn isn't
gonna bring it back.

00:19:42.163 --> 00:19:43.231
But just look!

00:20:02.236 --> 00:20:04.174
Popp: Hadlar's using
everything he's made of

00:20:04.207 --> 00:20:05.944
to pull off
one final attack...

00:20:05.978 --> 00:20:09.317
And trust me, it won't be
the kind you'll recover from.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:11.756
It'll contain all
of his will...

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:14.394
The unfulfilled wishes
of the Royal Guard...

00:20:14.428 --> 00:20:17.834
Please, a normal attack
isn't gonna be enough.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:21.375
Think about this.

00:20:21.408 --> 00:20:22.644
With all of your Aura spent,

00:20:22.678 --> 00:20:25.415
you won't be able to use
the Strash Cross either!

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.523
That's enough, okay?

00:20:28.557 --> 00:20:32.263
Leave the rest to us.
You've got nothing left.

00:20:32.297 --> 00:20:34.367
But you're wrong, Popp...

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.707
I still have one attack
that I want to try.

00:20:38.843 --> 00:20:41.649
Besides, Hadlar's
not the only one here...

00:20:41.683 --> 00:20:45.557
who's carrying out the wishes
of his friends in this fight.

00:20:47.928 --> 00:20:50.232
Everyone's will is within me.

00:20:50.266 --> 00:20:52.103
Master Avan and Grampa...

00:20:52.136 --> 00:20:53.907
and Dad, as well.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.712
With them, I can't lose.

00:20:56.746 --> 00:20:58.617
I'm going to prove
it wasn't a mistake

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:00.921
for them to believe in me...

00:21:00.954 --> 00:21:03.225
I don't care what it takes.

00:21:03.258 --> 00:21:05.129
And I'm willing
to pay the price.

00:21:05.162 --> 00:21:06.899
I'll never let Hadlar beat me!

00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:08.870
He won't win!

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.490
Popp [thought]: I really
am a coward, aren't I?

00:21:19.525 --> 00:21:21.395
How could I not have
faith in somebody

00:21:21.428 --> 00:21:23.933
who's got as much
heart as this guy?

00:21:30.379 --> 00:21:33.586
I'll give you this,
I'm impressed with your spirit.

00:21:34.655 --> 00:21:37.427
But what can you do?
Your friend wasn't wrong...

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:41.101
You barely have any
Aura left. It's hopeless.

00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:42.971
I can still do this...

00:21:43.238 --> 00:21:45.008
Zapple!

00:23:37.635 --> 00:23:39.037
Narrator: Through
sheer force of will,

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:41.909
Hadlar has clawed his way back
from the brink of defeat...

00:23:41.942 --> 00:23:44.648
And fueled by the memory
of his fallen Royal Guard,

00:23:44.681 --> 00:23:48.623
the Dark Lord levels a final
devastating attack on our Hero.

00:23:48.656 --> 00:23:49.792
Dai braces himself

00:23:49.825 --> 00:23:51.696
for the finishing bout
with his nemesis...

00:23:51.729 --> 00:23:53.264
But with his Aura depleted,

00:23:53.298 --> 00:23:56.238
will he be able to summon
the strength to defeat Hadlar,

00:23:56.271 --> 00:23:57.440
once and for all?

00:23:57.473 --> 00:23:58.643

00:23:58.676 --> 00:24:01.048
