WEBVTT

00:02:07.088 --> 00:02:09.391
All right. Let's move out.

00:02:09.927 --> 00:02:11.295
[chirping]

00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:14.068
Leona: Tomorrow, warriors
from around the world

00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:16.105
will gather in
the Carl Kingdom.

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:19.879
The time to begin our
counterattack has come!

00:02:19.913 --> 00:02:21.282
All: Yes!

00:02:22.485 --> 00:02:25.290
Leona: But...
where is everybody?

00:02:25.323 --> 00:02:28.196
Did their training
go that poorly?

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:30.969
Garuda: [screeching]

00:02:31.002 --> 00:02:32.605
Ah! They're here!

00:02:40.154 --> 00:02:41.455
Crocodine!

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.861
Baduck: About time!
You two ready?

00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:50.240
Well... we'll just have
to see on the battlefield.

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.845
Oh! There's Popp, too.

00:02:54.148 --> 00:02:55.317
Popp: Huh?

00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:57.922
No way. I thought I'd
be the first one back.

00:02:59.057 --> 00:03:00.694
You were wrong!

00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:04.903
Crocodine: Looks like you
learned a pretty intense spell.

00:03:04.937 --> 00:03:06.172
Eh, Popp?

00:03:06.206 --> 00:03:07.608
Guess so.

00:03:07.642 --> 00:03:10.413
And Matoriv?
I thought he'd be here.

00:03:10.447 --> 00:03:12.284
Right. About him...

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:13.419
He just said,

00:03:13.453 --> 00:03:15.123
"You're all exhausting...

00:03:15.156 --> 00:03:18.698
But I trust you
to finish the fight."

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:21.570
Speaking of, we're
still out three people,

00:03:21.603 --> 00:03:24.441
aren't we? Dai,
Hyunckel, and Maam...

00:03:24.475 --> 00:03:26.212
Maam: You mean two people.

00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:33.326
Hey!

00:03:44.682 --> 00:03:45.652
That leaves...

00:03:45.685 --> 00:03:46.686
Dai and Hyunckel.

00:03:47.755 --> 00:03:50.862
Yeah. I imagine the two
of them will take a while.

00:03:50.895 --> 00:03:53.801
Their weapons are being
completely restored.

00:03:53.834 --> 00:03:55.838
Or maybe not.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.292
Yes, Dai!

00:04:06.326 --> 00:04:07.829
Sorry... We're here.

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:13.306
So, pal.

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:14.743
Are you a total master with

00:04:14.777 --> 00:04:17.615
that crazy strong
new weapon of yours?

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.519
Uh, maybe?

00:04:19.553 --> 00:04:20.253
Huh?

00:04:20.287 --> 00:04:23.260
That's not...
Very reassuring?

00:04:23.293 --> 00:04:25.998
Well, I did everything
I possibly could

00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:27.368
in the time we had.

00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:28.302
Good enough!

00:04:31.075 --> 00:04:33.614
Well... I'm off.

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:36.051
Tell me. Before you
take your leave.

00:04:36.085 --> 00:04:38.757
That spear.
You were just a novice.

00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:39.693
But with a sword...

00:04:39.726 --> 00:04:42.464
You could have
easily matched me.

00:04:42.498 --> 00:04:43.332
Why?

00:04:43.968 --> 00:04:45.003
Because...

00:04:46.338 --> 00:04:48.409
This weapon...

00:04:48.443 --> 00:04:51.015
It was a parting
gift from a friend.

00:04:51.983 --> 00:04:53.654
A good answer.

00:04:53.688 --> 00:04:54.989
You know,

00:04:55.023 --> 00:04:58.029
I've never seen someone
trust their weapon like you.

00:04:58.063 --> 00:04:59.666
It's a special bond.

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:00.668
That boy, Dai.

00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:03.039
He should learn that trust.

00:05:05.511 --> 00:05:07.949
Alright. Then
is that everybody?

00:05:07.982 --> 00:05:10.287
Yes. We are ready.

00:05:10.321 --> 00:05:11.723
[remembering grunts]

00:05:12.926 --> 00:05:14.461
Hey, hold on a minute...

00:05:14.495 --> 00:05:17.168
Mhmm. That's right.

00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:18.804
Popp: There's one more!

00:05:18.837 --> 00:05:21.375
One more? What is
with those two?

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:24.414
Dunno. I mean, uh...
Who else is there?

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:31.796
[panting]

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.405
The book of Avan!

00:05:36.438 --> 00:05:40.046
I've never seen this before.
It's Master Avan's?

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:43.119
Yes, it is. And they're right.

00:05:43.152 --> 00:05:45.491
We're going to
Master's homeland.

00:05:45.525 --> 00:05:48.898
We have to bring this.

00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:52.204
Dai [thought]:
That's right. Our master...

00:05:52.237 --> 00:05:55.377
The one who
started all of this.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.081
Without his training,

00:05:57.114 --> 00:05:59.953
me, Popp, Maam...

00:05:59.987 --> 00:06:05.029
and even Hyunckel and Crocodine
wouldn't be here to fight today.

00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:08.469
Master. We're with you.

00:06:08.504 --> 00:06:10.240
This final battle...

00:06:10.273 --> 00:06:12.444
Belongs to you, as well!

00:06:44.542 --> 00:06:46.045
Baran: The Reaper.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.083
Killvearn: Wow!

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:50.053
[taunting chuckle]

00:06:50.086 --> 00:06:51.589
How chilling.

00:06:51.623 --> 00:06:55.698
Here I thought I
was so well hidden.

00:06:55.732 --> 00:06:59.606
No wonder King Vearn
is wary of you.

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:02.411
Finding you was
quite the hassle.

00:07:02.444 --> 00:07:04.549
I didn't think the
legendary Dragon Knight

00:07:04.582 --> 00:07:08.122
would be hiding in a cave
as desolate as this one.

00:07:08.724 --> 00:07:10.327
Baran: What do you want?

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.797
You couldn't possibly
think yourself

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.770
strong enough to defeat me.

00:07:14.803 --> 00:07:16.372
Killvearn: And you
couldn't possibly think

00:07:16.406 --> 00:07:18.611
I would make
such a poor assassin.

00:07:18.644 --> 00:07:21.850
Baran: Are you under
orders from the Dark King?

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.029
Because he made
a promise to me.

00:07:28.062 --> 00:07:32.304
Humans are filth that
pollute the Surface World.

00:07:32.337 --> 00:07:34.843
He promised to wipe
them from this earth

00:07:34.876 --> 00:07:38.450
and that he would
create a paradise.

00:07:38.483 --> 00:07:41.089
He asked for my cooperation,

00:07:41.122 --> 00:07:45.396
and that I would not
challenge him until after.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:51.543
That's why I served under Hadlar
and fought on the front lines.

00:07:53.847 --> 00:07:56.654
You're saying the
promise was a lie?

00:07:56.687 --> 00:07:58.289
Killvearn: [chuckling]

00:07:58.322 --> 00:07:59.859
Of course not.

00:07:59.892 --> 00:08:03.567
Everything King Vearn
said was completely true.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.105
Humanity will become extinct.

00:08:06.138 --> 00:08:08.944
But it won't end there, oh no.

00:08:08.977 --> 00:08:12.051
The monsters,
Dragons and Darklings...

00:08:12.084 --> 00:08:15.057
Every creature that lives
on the Surface World

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.894
will be exterminated.

00:08:16.927 --> 00:08:23.306
After all, King Vearn's
true objective...

00:08:23.339 --> 00:08:27.213
is to erase the
Surface World itself.

00:08:27.849 --> 00:08:28.951
Baran: What?

00:08:28.984 --> 00:08:32.959
Killvearn: You fought
King Velzar the Abyss Dragon,

00:08:32.993 --> 00:08:35.130
so you should know.

00:08:35.163 --> 00:08:39.639
Deep below the ground, where
you and I stand at this moment,

00:08:39.672 --> 00:08:42.678
lies an entire separate world.

00:08:43.212 --> 00:08:44.181
Underworld?

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:46.218
Killvearn: Correct.

00:08:46.252 --> 00:08:50.193
The land of darkness which
the gods gave to the Darklings.

00:08:50.226 --> 00:08:54.636
A world of chaos where
strength is the only law.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:56.540
King Vearn's true wish is

00:08:56.573 --> 00:09:00.280
to lift the Underworld
up to the surface.

00:09:00.313 --> 00:09:01.482
[smug chuckle]

00:09:01.516 --> 00:09:02.819
It's a secret that not even

00:09:02.852 --> 00:09:06.191
his most powerful
servant Hadlar knows.

00:09:09.432 --> 00:09:10.568
Baran: [distressed exhale]

00:09:10.602 --> 00:09:13.306
Killvearn: Doesn't
it sound wonderful?

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.343
The Surface World erased;

00:09:15.377 --> 00:09:16.713
and all of its inhabitants

00:09:16.746 --> 00:09:20.119
consumed by the
darkness at last.

00:09:20.153 --> 00:09:23.727
Only the powerful and
those who enjoy destruction

00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:27.200
and slaughter will
survive in this new realm.

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:30.774
This is King Vearn's paradise.

00:09:30.807 --> 00:09:33.313
And it is my
mission to eliminate

00:09:33.346 --> 00:09:36.285
any threat to his goal.

00:09:37.453 --> 00:09:38.623
Baran: You fool!

00:09:45.772 --> 00:09:48.476
What you describe...

00:09:48.511 --> 00:09:50.881
That is called Hell!

00:09:53.988 --> 00:09:57.194
Killvearn: I-It's
been fully restored?

00:09:57.227 --> 00:09:59.397
The Demon Dragon Blade.

00:10:00.534 --> 00:10:02.706
Killvearn: My Reaper
Flute was supposed to

00:10:02.739 --> 00:10:04.742
neutralize his senses...

00:10:04.776 --> 00:10:06.746
Yet it did nothing.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.151
This man is more...

00:10:09.185 --> 00:10:13.058
than a simple... beast...

00:10:16.499 --> 00:10:18.369
Baran: Dark King Vearn.

00:10:18.403 --> 00:10:23.947
If this is your intent,
then I have ideas of my own.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.399
This is terrible!

00:10:56.379 --> 00:11:02.758
[cheering]

00:11:02.792 --> 00:11:04.227
Take care, Princess!

00:11:04.261 --> 00:11:07.935
May the great gods of Papnica
bless you all on your journey!

00:11:10.908 --> 00:11:14.348
Popp: Wow, look at
how small Papnica is.

00:11:14.381 --> 00:11:18.389
"Off to the field of battle!
Farewell, dear homeland!"

00:11:18.422 --> 00:11:19.926
Something like that, princess?

00:11:19.959 --> 00:11:22.565
I had no idea you were a poet.

00:11:22.598 --> 00:11:24.267
After those pretty words...

00:11:24.301 --> 00:11:27.307
It'd be a real shame if you
ran away again, wouldn't it?

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.810
Hey! Come on.

00:11:28.844 --> 00:11:30.714
Do you really
still think of me as

00:11:30.748 --> 00:11:33.152
some kind of cowardly
chicken, or something?

00:11:33.186 --> 00:11:36.325
No way. Those days
are long behind me.

00:11:36.358 --> 00:11:38.329
I'm sticking around for good.

00:11:38.362 --> 00:11:39.498
Well, back then...

00:11:39.533 --> 00:11:41.168
It did happen a lot.

00:11:42.003 --> 00:11:42.906
Uh-huh.

00:11:42.939 --> 00:11:43.472
What?!

00:11:43.507 --> 00:11:45.711
[laughing]

00:11:45.745 --> 00:11:47.347
Alright...

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:48.315
Anyways.

00:11:48.349 --> 00:11:49.384
I'm glad Merle came along

00:11:49.418 --> 00:11:53.359
since she can at least
sense enemies, but...

00:11:53.392 --> 00:11:56.165
why is Miss Amy here?

00:11:56.198 --> 00:12:00.072
I thought... You had to stay
behind to protect Papnica?

00:12:00.106 --> 00:12:03.513
I'm... Her Highness's
royal bodyguard, okay?

00:12:03.547 --> 00:12:07.420
We don't know what kind of
danger lies on the path ahead.

00:12:10.159 --> 00:12:13.666
And besides, I would be
an asset in any situation!

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.871
You need to be more
than an "asset."

00:12:15.904 --> 00:12:19.477
This is going to be our
hardest fought battle yet.

00:12:19.512 --> 00:12:22.317
So stick to guarding
the Princess.

00:12:24.421 --> 00:12:26.359
[chuckling]

00:12:26.392 --> 00:12:27.060
Hey, Maam...

00:12:27.094 --> 00:12:28.931
What's going on with Amy?

00:12:28.964 --> 00:12:30.099
What do you mean?

00:12:30.133 --> 00:12:31.001
Oh, c'mon.

00:12:31.034 --> 00:12:33.940
Being a little
suspicious, isn't she?

00:12:33.973 --> 00:12:37.881
Popp: She's got the whole
"for the man I love" thing.

00:12:37.915 --> 00:12:39.953
Merle: How can Popp
be so perceptive

00:12:39.986 --> 00:12:42.825
when it comes to other women?

00:12:42.859 --> 00:12:45.029
I wouldn't worry
too much, Hyunckel.

00:12:45.063 --> 00:12:47.334
The leaders of the
world have gathered

00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:50.307
all sorts of powerful
warriors there.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:53.145
It's worthwhile having
her there with us,

00:12:53.178 --> 00:12:55.951
even just to help as a healer.

00:12:56.787 --> 00:12:57.989
Amy [thought]: Princess...

00:12:58.022 --> 00:13:00.862
Wow. Powerful warriors, huh?

00:13:00.895 --> 00:13:04.435
Yeah, buddy! I wonder
what they're like!

00:13:04.468 --> 00:13:06.005
I'll put the screws to 'em.

00:13:06.038 --> 00:13:08.977
See how tough they really
are. Right, Hyunckel?

00:13:10.346 --> 00:13:11.983
They'd better be.

00:13:13.687 --> 00:13:15.657
What's wrong, my friend?

00:13:15.691 --> 00:13:18.296
Something's clearly
worrying you.

00:13:18.329 --> 00:13:19.498
Well...

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:20.934
It's just...

00:13:20.968 --> 00:13:23.205
The Princess has a point.

00:13:23.239 --> 00:13:25.744
We all have something
at stake in this fight.

00:13:25.777 --> 00:13:28.483
And it's important
to stand together.

00:13:28.517 --> 00:13:29.284
Still...

00:13:29.317 --> 00:13:31.656
We have no idea
what will happen.

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:32.991
And all of those
innocent lives

00:13:33.025 --> 00:13:36.098
are being put in harm's way
with this counterattack.

00:13:36.866 --> 00:13:39.170
I've never even seen his face,

00:13:39.204 --> 00:13:43.079
but I've felt the Dark King's
immense presence, before.

00:13:43.112 --> 00:13:44.415
Standing up against him

00:13:44.448 --> 00:13:47.487
is going to take more than
I think we're capable of.

00:13:48.557 --> 00:13:49.826
That's true.

00:13:49.859 --> 00:13:53.298
I think we're on the same
page in this, swordsman.

00:15:06.411 --> 00:15:09.485
We're here.
So, what do you think? Leona?

00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:10.888
Well. This is where...

00:15:10.921 --> 00:15:13.727
The Carl Castle used to be.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.196
It looks like the Dark Army

00:15:15.229 --> 00:15:17.768
completely
demolished it, though.

00:15:17.802 --> 00:15:20.005
Our base is supposed
to be nearby.

00:15:20.908 --> 00:15:22.778
Master Avan.

00:15:22.811 --> 00:15:24.481
It's his homeland.

00:15:24.515 --> 00:15:25.818
Quite the view.

00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:27.153
Hyunckel: Indeed.

00:15:27.186 --> 00:15:29.859
But now is not the time
to get sentimental.

00:15:29.892 --> 00:15:31.294
Popp: That thing's incredible.

00:15:31.328 --> 00:15:34.167
It reaches right
through the clouds.

00:15:34.201 --> 00:15:36.138
If that is the
enemy's stronghold,

00:15:36.172 --> 00:15:38.409
Then it is
unbelievably huge.

00:15:38.442 --> 00:15:41.583
It almost feels like they're
just asking us to attack-

00:15:41.616 --> 00:15:44.655
like they were waiting
for us to get here.

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:50.734
We should get prepared.

00:15:50.768 --> 00:15:52.738
We don't know
what's coming next.

00:16:04.528 --> 00:16:05.665
Who's there?!

00:16:05.698 --> 00:16:08.302
Whoa... Wait a minute.

00:16:08.335 --> 00:16:09.337
It's me!

00:16:10.105 --> 00:16:11.308
Uh, it's Akhim?

00:16:11.342 --> 00:16:14.380
Bengarna Kingdom's
Tank Unit commander?

00:16:14.414 --> 00:16:18.656
I spotted your balloon,
so I came to greet you.

00:16:19.424 --> 00:16:19.993
Phew...

00:16:20.026 --> 00:16:21.128
Close call.

00:16:21.161 --> 00:16:23.533
We thought you might
have been the enemy.

00:16:23.567 --> 00:16:24.669
What's up?

00:16:24.702 --> 00:16:27.107
Did you shave your head
because you lost the tank unit?

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.244
Or... lost a bet?

00:16:29.278 --> 00:16:33.419
Akhim: Uh... No, sir.
I've always been bald.

00:16:33.452 --> 00:16:34.889
I see...

00:16:34.923 --> 00:16:38.295
Also, the landscape
has been shifting.

00:16:38.328 --> 00:16:40.668
The Field of Death
has now changed.

00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:42.638
Yeah. We saw from above.

00:16:42.671 --> 00:16:44.374
It saves us some time.

00:16:44.407 --> 00:16:45.442
General Bowson;

00:16:45.476 --> 00:16:47.948
He's waiting for
you all at the base.

00:16:47.981 --> 00:16:49.919
I'll show you
the quickest way.

00:16:49.952 --> 00:16:51.388
Please, follow me.

00:16:51.421 --> 00:16:52.424
Many thanks.

00:16:52.457 --> 00:16:54.494
Are all of the
soldiers there, as well?

00:16:54.529 --> 00:16:58.335
Akhim: No. The warriors aren't
at the base of operations.

00:16:58.369 --> 00:17:02.109
Most of them went to the
shipbuilding site in Zababa.

00:17:05.784 --> 00:17:07.922
Hey. What's this Zababa place?

00:17:07.955 --> 00:17:10.492
It's a small fishing
port we've secured,

00:17:10.527 --> 00:17:13.365
out on the northern banks
of the Carl Kingdom's border.

00:17:13.399 --> 00:17:16.238
In secret, we've been
building a giant ship.

00:17:16.272 --> 00:17:18.008
One large enough
to fit everyone.

00:17:18.041 --> 00:17:20.815
For the final offensive
on Hadlar's forces.

00:17:20.848 --> 00:17:21.983
There'll be almost...

00:17:22.017 --> 00:17:23.954
thirty of us all together.

00:17:23.987 --> 00:17:26.124
A small craft just won't do.

00:17:27.528 --> 00:17:30.033
Wait, I think we're
missing someone.

00:17:30.066 --> 00:17:31.569
Where did Chiu go?

00:17:41.957 --> 00:17:43.358
[laughing]

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.629
[curious chirp]

00:17:44.662 --> 00:17:46.231
[startled shriek]

00:17:46.833 --> 00:17:48.168
Where did you come from?!

00:17:48.201 --> 00:17:51.174
[chiding chirps]

00:17:51.208 --> 00:17:52.545
Chiu: Hmph! So what?

00:17:52.578 --> 00:17:55.517
I'm going to scout
the enemy's movements.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:57.721
Gather what
intelligence I can.

00:17:57.754 --> 00:18:00.928
Prove the legendary
Chiu's value at last!

00:18:00.961 --> 00:18:02.196
[uncertain chirp]

00:18:02.229 --> 00:18:05.504
What do you mean?
You think I don't have a plan?

00:18:05.537 --> 00:18:06.471
[scoff]

00:18:06.505 --> 00:18:09.244
Don't underestimate
the great karate rat.

00:18:09.277 --> 00:18:13.152
I'm just as worthy as Crocodine
for the "Beast King" title.

00:18:13.185 --> 00:18:14.421
[confused chirp]

00:18:14.454 --> 00:18:15.791
Chiu: Ta-da!

00:18:15.824 --> 00:18:16.659
[curious chirp]

00:18:16.692 --> 00:18:18.863
Chiu: This is
the Beast King Flute.

00:18:18.897 --> 00:18:22.805
Crocodine gave it to me as
thanks for helping him train.

00:18:22.838 --> 00:18:23.941
This item...

00:18:23.974 --> 00:18:25.711
It summons nearby monsters.

00:18:25.744 --> 00:18:28.950
And then after I manage to
defeat them all in combat...

00:18:28.984 --> 00:18:31.656
They will be my
loyal subordinates!

00:18:31.689 --> 00:18:33.059
[amazed chirp]

00:18:33.092 --> 00:18:34.528
Eventually,

00:18:34.562 --> 00:18:38.703
I will form a mighty legion of
monsters that fights for good!

00:18:38.737 --> 00:18:40.073
Now, then.

00:18:40.106 --> 00:18:42.177
Why don't we point
this thing at the sky?

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:45.249
See if we can get
a flying monster.

00:18:55.236 --> 00:18:57.373
[screeching]

00:18:57.406 --> 00:19:00.981
I... guess sometimes
they come... in groups.

00:19:01.015 --> 00:19:02.518
[terrifying screech]

00:19:02.551 --> 00:19:05.322
Chiu [thought]:
They look... a little tough.

00:19:05.356 --> 00:19:07.159
[frightened chirps]

00:19:08.697 --> 00:19:11.134
Gomez: Wow.
It's almost complete!

00:19:11.167 --> 00:19:14.474
The Dark Army won't expect
this scale of an attack.

00:19:21.322 --> 00:19:22.858
What is that thing?

00:19:31.074 --> 00:19:33.378
Is he a bad guy?

00:19:33.411 --> 00:19:36.519
It's so annoying. I can see
you from the other shore.

00:19:36.553 --> 00:19:38.923
You humans...
so predictable.

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:40.292
What the....

00:19:40.326 --> 00:19:42.765
You've got a lot
of nerve, metal man.

00:19:42.798 --> 00:19:44.134
Coming here alone.

00:19:44.167 --> 00:19:45.302
[scoff]

00:19:45.336 --> 00:19:48.375
Oh, no. I brought
my friends, as well.

00:20:25.951 --> 00:20:31.562
Now, introducing; The Dark
Lord Hadlar's Royal Guard.

00:20:39.477 --> 00:20:41.982
Bowson: We're glad you
made it here safely.

00:20:42.016 --> 00:20:45.223
And now that all the world's
warriors have gathered,

00:20:45.256 --> 00:20:48.328
all that's left is
to complete the ship!

00:20:49.264 --> 00:20:50.299
An attack?!

00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:53.506
No. I think...
that was a Zoom spell.

00:20:57.213 --> 00:21:00.086
Popp: I know you!
Fobster, the mage?!

00:21:00.119 --> 00:21:02.323
It's an... emergency.

00:21:02.357 --> 00:21:04.729
Zababa's... under attack.

00:21:04.762 --> 00:21:05.930
[surprised gasps]

00:21:05.964 --> 00:21:09.571
Fobster: Five beings made of
some kind of silver metal...

00:21:10.372 --> 00:21:12.544
They just attacked the dock.

00:21:12.878 --> 00:21:13.747
It's them.

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.551
Hadlar's Royal Guard.

00:21:15.584 --> 00:21:17.621
The others - Are they safe?

00:21:18.421 --> 00:21:19.625
They're strong.

00:21:19.659 --> 00:21:22.429
Too strong for
us to stop them.

00:21:23.132 --> 00:21:24.802
The others are gone...

00:21:24.835 --> 00:21:29.144
I used Zoom to come
back and warn you guys.

00:21:29.177 --> 00:21:30.781
We need to help them.

00:21:30.814 --> 00:21:31.615
Hang on.

00:21:31.649 --> 00:21:33.285
A Zoom spell
won't take us somewhere

00:21:33.318 --> 00:21:35.122
we haven't been before.

00:21:35.156 --> 00:21:36.358
Then we have to fly.

00:21:36.391 --> 00:21:37.995
We'll start by heading north.

00:21:38.028 --> 00:21:41.602
Popp and I can go scout
it out, then get everyone!

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.577
Nova: Don't bother with that.

00:21:47.113 --> 00:21:49.083
I should be help enough.

00:21:51.321 --> 00:21:53.593
Oh, yeah? And you are?

00:21:55.263 --> 00:21:57.801
Nova: My name is... Nova.

00:21:58.235 --> 00:21:59.738
I'm the Hero...

00:21:59.771 --> 00:22:01.040
of the North.

00:23:37.801 --> 00:23:40.105
Narrator: With the port
town of Zababa under attack,

00:23:40.138 --> 00:23:44.213
Nova, the Hero of the
North comes to the rescue.

00:23:44.247 --> 00:23:47.654
Hadlar's Orichalcum warriors
put up a vicious fight,

00:23:47.687 --> 00:23:51.495
and Nova is forced to
unleash his greatest attack...

00:23:51.529 --> 00:23:53.766
But no one can
imagine the true power

00:23:53.799 --> 00:23:55.970
possessed by the Royal Guard.

00:23:56.004 --> 00:23:57.708
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:57.741 --> 00:24:00.345
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:00.379 --> 00:24:02.917
"The Hadlar Royal Guard".
