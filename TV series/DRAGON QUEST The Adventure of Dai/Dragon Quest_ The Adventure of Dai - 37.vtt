WEBVTT

00:01:50.621 --> 00:01:55.899
A Superior Being is
meant to be invincible!

00:01:55.932 --> 00:01:57.301
Maam, hit his stomach!

00:01:57.334 --> 00:01:59.171
That should knock Dai loose!

00:02:04.181 --> 00:02:05.417
No, you don't!

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:07.856
That was a feint!

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:09.225
Warrior-Master Style....

00:02:09.258 --> 00:02:11.863
Refractor Fist!

00:02:26.092 --> 00:02:28.564
She did it! Now
we've got him back!

00:02:43.092 --> 00:02:45.598
Popp: Good...
He's still in one piece.

00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:48.337
It probably has something
to do with his new outfit.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.345
Hey, Maam! It looks
like Dai's gonna be okay!

00:02:52.378 --> 00:02:55.117
Chiu, use one of your
items to heal him.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.654
You've got this, right?

00:02:56.687 --> 00:02:58.690
Sure! Leave it to me!

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:04.669
[pained groan]

00:03:05.203 --> 00:03:06.439
[furious snarl]

00:03:07.776 --> 00:03:09.713
No... Th-This is my...

00:03:09.746 --> 00:03:12.518
My immortal body... How?

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.790
How did you...

00:03:14.823 --> 00:03:16.325
Maam: [battle cry]

00:03:28.015 --> 00:03:30.788
She's incredible.
A real force.

00:03:33.493 --> 00:03:35.665
Maam is so much
stronger now - for real.

00:03:35.698 --> 00:03:38.537
And that special attack
is beyond belief!

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.614
[proud chuckle]

00:03:43.647 --> 00:03:44.850
You impressed?

00:03:44.883 --> 00:03:47.622
That strength comes from our
training with Master Brokeena,

00:03:47.656 --> 00:03:51.228
if you care to know - it's also
where she learned that attack.

00:03:51.262 --> 00:03:53.768
It's known as
the Refractor Fist!

00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:56.039
Brokeena: That's right,
The Refractor Fist.

00:03:56.072 --> 00:03:57.742
[mischievous chuckle]

00:03:57.775 --> 00:04:01.015
Maam - I can't
deny it. I'm impressed.

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.384
Your progress...
is unmatched.

00:04:02.417 --> 00:04:04.322
It would take years
for a typical student

00:04:04.355 --> 00:04:06.426
of the Martial Arts
to learn what you have-

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.298
and you've done it all
in just a matter of days.

00:04:09.331 --> 00:04:10.835
All that remains is
to teach you

00:04:10.868 --> 00:04:14.408
my Warrior-Master
Style's greatest skill.

00:04:14.442 --> 00:04:16.546
But I am feeble and ill...

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.986
It pains me that I can't
show it to you myself.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.493
[coughing]

00:04:23.527 --> 00:04:25.430
I am a disappointment.

00:04:25.464 --> 00:04:28.236
Uh... N-No, of course not.

00:04:28.269 --> 00:04:31.710
Grand Master? What is
it that's making you sick?

00:04:33.848 --> 00:04:36.352
[coughing]

00:04:36.385 --> 00:04:39.091
Tinglebuttitis.

00:04:39.125 --> 00:04:40.595
Huh?

00:04:40.628 --> 00:04:42.164
Chiu [thought]:
Why would something called

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:44.836
Tingle-butt-itis
make you cough?

00:04:48.276 --> 00:04:49.579
But... do not worry.

00:04:49.613 --> 00:04:52.184
I'm very confident in
your abilities, Maam.

00:04:52.217 --> 00:04:54.589
I know you're capable.

00:04:55.725 --> 00:04:58.830
Then - what sort of
skill is it, Master?

00:04:58.864 --> 00:05:01.570
Brokeena: You must combine
your new Warrior-Master Style

00:05:01.603 --> 00:05:03.239
with a certain spell.

00:05:03.273 --> 00:05:04.976
But Grand Master...

00:05:06.513 --> 00:05:09.285
Before our training
I was a Warrior Priest.

00:05:09.318 --> 00:05:12.458
It's impossible... for me,
to use attack spells.

00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:13.961
You should know by now-

00:05:13.995 --> 00:05:17.467
attack spells aren't the
only way to defeat an enemy.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.942
Brokeena: The spell
in question is...

00:05:20.975 --> 00:05:22.277
a Heal spell.

00:05:22.311 --> 00:05:23.780
Both: A Heal spell?!

00:05:32.464 --> 00:05:35.237
Brokeena: A Healing-type
spell will magically boost

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.543
a body's biological functions.

00:05:38.577 --> 00:05:41.349
But, just as plants
wither and die

00:05:41.382 --> 00:05:43.386
when they are
watered too often,

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.390
excessive healing magic can,

00:05:45.424 --> 00:05:49.431
ironically, destroy
a body's tissue.

00:05:49.465 --> 00:05:53.240
Long ago, such excessive
healing magic was feared

00:05:53.273 --> 00:05:56.780
and known as something
called "Overheal."

00:05:56.813 --> 00:05:57.982
Overheal...

00:05:58.016 --> 00:06:01.289
Brokeena: It was only the most
powerful Priests and Sages

00:06:01.322 --> 00:06:04.094
that could wield
the Overheal spell

00:06:04.128 --> 00:06:06.466
effectively on
the battlefield.

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:10.239
But, over time, users of
the spell started to disappear.

00:06:10.273 --> 00:06:12.444
It requires a
magical power beyond

00:06:12.477 --> 00:06:14.983
the healing-type
spells we know today.

00:06:15.016 --> 00:06:18.056
Now, Overheal, when
effectively combined

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:20.059
with the Warrior Master Style,

00:06:20.093 --> 00:06:23.567
is the basis of a technique
I developed that yields

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.507
devastating force on
the moment of impact.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.343
When used, it creates

00:06:28.376 --> 00:06:30.715
an overwhelming
life-draining effect,

00:06:30.748 --> 00:06:34.121
sending a fatal shock
through the enemy's body.

00:06:35.692 --> 00:06:39.165
This attack... is fatal?!

00:06:39.198 --> 00:06:41.537
It sounds... Terrifying.

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.010
Brokeena: Yes.
It is a terrifying skill.

00:06:45.043 --> 00:06:47.682
And I believe that only
those who understand

00:06:47.715 --> 00:06:50.955
just how terrifying it
is should be taught.

00:06:50.988 --> 00:06:54.963
I've been called a
Grand Master for decades now.

00:06:54.996 --> 00:06:57.535
But you are the first
student I've ever thought

00:06:57.568 --> 00:06:59.939
worthy enough
to share it with.

00:07:01.977 --> 00:07:03.514
Master...

00:07:03.547 --> 00:07:06.486
Brokeena: Just as
your first Master, Avan,

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.993
trusted you and gave
you the Magic Bullet Gun,

00:07:10.027 --> 00:07:12.999
I also trust that
you will always have

00:07:13.032 --> 00:07:14.969
a kind and just heart.

00:07:15.003 --> 00:07:19.779
And that is why I will teach
it to you, my dear Maam.

00:07:21.516 --> 00:07:24.656
Then I thank you,
Grand Master.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.125
Wow!

00:07:26.158 --> 00:07:27.494
Pretty cool, huh?

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:28.964
Chiu: [embarrassed groan]

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:36.846
[roaring kick]

00:07:41.489 --> 00:07:42.858
[snarling]

00:07:58.322 --> 00:08:00.695
How did she...
That was awesome.

00:08:00.728 --> 00:08:02.598
Chiu: That's
Miss Maam for you!

00:08:03.433 --> 00:08:04.334
Hey, Dai...

00:08:04.368 --> 00:08:05.237
Popp: You're awake!

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.374
I guess I am. What happened?

00:08:07.407 --> 00:08:09.546
Maam's the one
that got you out.

00:08:09.579 --> 00:08:10.914
Chiu: Of course she did.

00:08:27.948 --> 00:08:31.489
She's amazing. I didn't know
she could fight like that-

00:08:31.523 --> 00:08:32.825
[pained groan]

00:08:32.859 --> 00:08:33.527
Dai!

00:08:33.561 --> 00:08:35.430
Hey, Chiu - a little help?

00:08:35.463 --> 00:08:37.802
Didn't Maam say you
had some healing items?

00:08:37.836 --> 00:08:41.276
If you do now's the time
to use 'em, don't you think?

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:43.647
Oh yeah, that's right!

00:08:44.916 --> 00:08:48.189
I'll give you some
medicinal herb.

00:08:48.791 --> 00:08:50.159
Here!

00:08:50.193 --> 00:08:51.930
That's an antidotal herb.

00:08:54.468 --> 00:08:55.304
Chiu: Here!

00:08:55.337 --> 00:08:56.973
That's a poison herb.

00:08:58.944 --> 00:09:01.015
What's going on?
They're gone!

00:09:01.049 --> 00:09:04.287
I always carry at least
five medicinal herbs...

00:09:05.189 --> 00:09:06.359
That's right...

00:09:06.392 --> 00:09:08.496
I used them all
when I was attacked by

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:11.970
a pack of Teeny Sanguini
in the mountains!

00:09:12.003 --> 00:09:14.610
Who could possibly need
five medicinal herbs

00:09:14.643 --> 00:09:16.078
against those things?!

00:09:17.548 --> 00:09:19.351
[pained groan]

00:09:20.988 --> 00:09:22.725
It's over!

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:33.446
Maam [thought]: Oh, no...

00:09:33.479 --> 00:09:34.615
[chuckling]

00:09:34.649 --> 00:09:36.052
Ah, good.

00:09:36.085 --> 00:09:40.126
My theory is proved correct.
I've found your weakness, girl.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.765
You have two types
of powerful attacks:

00:09:42.799 --> 00:09:46.640
Attacks where your hands glow,
and ones where they don't!

00:09:46.674 --> 00:09:48.777
Zamza: But whatever
those attacks are,

00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:51.248
they need to be channeled
through your fist.

00:09:51.282 --> 00:09:53.654
And that without them,
you'd have no method of

00:09:53.687 --> 00:09:56.325
delivering that
moment of impact.

00:09:56.359 --> 00:09:58.429
That's a special
coating mucus.

00:09:58.462 --> 00:10:01.235
And it won't come off easily!

00:10:02.337 --> 00:10:04.842
Zamza: It's time to give up!

00:10:06.278 --> 00:10:07.147
Oh, no!

00:10:07.181 --> 00:10:09.685
If Maam can't use
her fists anymore...

00:10:10.486 --> 00:10:13.292
That's not good.
W-What can we do?!

00:10:17.067 --> 00:10:18.971
Don't you have
anything?! Come on!

00:10:19.004 --> 00:10:21.009
Our stamina is still too low.

00:10:21.042 --> 00:10:23.379
You must have some
kind of item in there?!

00:10:25.383 --> 00:10:27.955
Oh! This is...
a Teardrop Acorn.

00:10:27.989 --> 00:10:29.626
Finally! What will it do?

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.095
What it sounds like.

00:10:31.129 --> 00:10:34.334
It'll cure a teardrop's worth
of stamina to whoever uses it!

00:10:35.337 --> 00:10:37.107
Great. So... It's useless.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.012
No. It's enough.
That's all I need!

00:10:42.451 --> 00:10:43.420
It's over!

00:10:43.453 --> 00:10:44.956
Zamza: Without that attack,

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:48.964
you have nothing-
to hurt my immortal form!

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:51.970
Zamza: This ends now!

00:10:52.004 --> 00:10:53.139
No, Maam!

00:10:53.172 --> 00:10:56.145
Chiu, please... We're
useless without a weapon.

00:10:56.178 --> 00:10:57.681
You'll have to carry me.

00:11:00.688 --> 00:11:02.390
We need to hurry!

00:11:14.783 --> 00:11:17.153
Zamza: This ends now!

00:11:19.558 --> 00:11:22.397
Zamza: [roaring]

00:11:27.508 --> 00:11:28.442
Maam!

00:11:49.586 --> 00:11:52.290
Run! Get out of
there while you can!

00:11:52.324 --> 00:11:55.897
Popp [thought]: Dai - if you're
planning something, hurry.

00:12:00.373 --> 00:12:03.647
You know, you're a lot
heavier than you look.

00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:05.551
I'm sorry, really...

00:12:05.585 --> 00:12:09.592
but I can't spare the stamina
to climb all the way up there.

00:12:09.626 --> 00:12:14.669
I need to use everything I
have... for one final attack.

00:12:14.703 --> 00:12:17.675
I realized it while I
was watching Maam fight.

00:12:17.709 --> 00:12:20.515
Even though I have
this powerful crest,

00:12:20.548 --> 00:12:22.851
it's mostly going to waste.

00:12:23.687 --> 00:12:24.923
All this time,

00:12:24.956 --> 00:12:27.662
I've been fighting while
using it at full throttle.

00:12:27.695 --> 00:12:31.803
That's why my energy
always burns up so fast.

00:12:32.939 --> 00:12:36.513
I can see now that
timing is everything.

00:12:36.546 --> 00:12:38.483
It's about finding
the exact moment

00:12:38.517 --> 00:12:40.252
that the attack should hit.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:44.930
Even if it's just
a little bit of power,

00:12:44.963 --> 00:12:49.371
if I use it as
precisely as Maam does...

00:12:49.404 --> 00:12:51.843
It's over. We win.

00:12:59.325 --> 00:13:01.328
[roaring]

00:13:02.765 --> 00:13:05.504
I think you've caused
me quite enough trouble.

00:13:06.672 --> 00:13:08.510
[pained yell]

00:13:08.544 --> 00:13:12.083
While I am still curious about
that strange attack of yours...

00:13:12.116 --> 00:13:14.755
you are enough of a threat
that I should forget it

00:13:14.789 --> 00:13:16.960
and simply eliminate you.

00:13:16.994 --> 00:13:21.435
Maam: [struggling grunts]

00:13:23.105 --> 00:13:26.780
Maam [thought]: Dai?! He's going
for the Sword of Champions.

00:13:26.813 --> 00:13:29.184
Alright - he must have
some kind of plan.

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.763
Maam [thought]: I have
to do whatever I can

00:13:34.796 --> 00:13:36.599
to distract this thing.

00:13:36.633 --> 00:13:37.902
[laughing]

00:13:37.935 --> 00:13:40.039
Such pitiful human behavior.

00:13:40.072 --> 00:13:44.047
You resist so desperately,
even in the face of defeat.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.487
To me, you're
nothing but mere trash.

00:13:47.521 --> 00:13:51.195
You're wrong. That's no way
to talk about a living being.

00:13:51.228 --> 00:13:53.867
No matter what kind
of creature it is...

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.005
And if you still
don't understand that,

00:13:56.038 --> 00:13:59.110
then you are the one
that's actually trash!

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.020
Zaboera: Listen to me,
Zamza, you are a tool.

00:14:04.054 --> 00:14:09.265
Every creature that exists in
this world is a tool in my eyes.

00:14:09.298 --> 00:14:12.303
Understand?
Now, go out into the world.

00:14:12.337 --> 00:14:14.709
Collect what knowledge
and power that you can.

00:14:14.743 --> 00:14:16.111
Father...

00:14:16.145 --> 00:14:19.819
Zaboera: Otherwise, you are
nothing to me... but trash.

00:14:19.853 --> 00:14:21.222
Zaboera: Don't you agree?

00:14:21.255 --> 00:14:24.662
How else would you
describe a useless tool

00:14:24.695 --> 00:14:27.300
without a single
redeeming quality?

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:33.112
[evil cackling]

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:38.657
I am... I am not trash!

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:42.632
My power and mind
are unmatched!

00:14:42.665 --> 00:14:43.967
If I wished,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.609
I could be commander of
the Mystic or Furfang Legion.

00:14:47.642 --> 00:14:50.413
How dare you mock me?!

00:14:50.446 --> 00:14:54.121
[pained cry]

00:14:54.154 --> 00:14:55.524
Stop it!

00:14:55.558 --> 00:14:57.126
Miss Maam!

00:14:57.695 --> 00:14:58.495
Chiu...

00:14:58.530 --> 00:14:59.966
Quick - give me the acorn.

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:01.268
Chiu: Right!

00:15:08.249 --> 00:15:09.050
It work?

00:15:11.054 --> 00:15:14.161
Yeah. I'm getting
my strength back.

00:15:14.194 --> 00:15:16.431
Even if it is
just a little bit.

00:15:20.774 --> 00:15:25.416
Sword of Champions, lend me
all of your mighty power!

00:15:27.187 --> 00:15:28.089
What?

00:15:28.122 --> 00:15:30.459
That brat! When did
he reach the sword?!

00:15:31.796 --> 00:15:32.965
Brokeena: A Frizz spell!

00:15:32.999 --> 00:15:34.902
Popp: Where did
you come from?!

00:15:34.935 --> 00:15:36.606
Brokeena: Just cast the spell!

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:37.575
You think?

00:15:37.608 --> 00:15:39.445
I have enough magic
power to pull it off,

00:15:39.478 --> 00:15:41.649
but I doubt it'll help!

00:15:41.683 --> 00:15:43.185
Brokeena: Fire it at Maam.

00:15:43.787 --> 00:15:45.156
Brokeena: Do it, Popp!

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:51.168
Right!

00:15:52.303 --> 00:15:53.506
Maam!

00:15:54.909 --> 00:15:57.113
Frizz!

00:15:57.147 --> 00:15:59.150
Popp: This should
take the slime off!

00:16:00.721 --> 00:16:01.923
No, no...

00:16:01.956 --> 00:16:04.595
Refractor Fist!

00:16:10.707 --> 00:16:12.043
Here goes...

00:16:12.076 --> 00:16:15.751
All of the strength I have-
is going into this attack!

00:16:15.784 --> 00:16:17.353
Avan...

00:16:17.655 --> 00:16:19.992
Strash!

00:16:20.026 --> 00:16:24.067
[howling]

00:16:39.599 --> 00:16:40.499
How's that?

00:16:43.673 --> 00:16:45.175
Did it work?!

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.195
[shocked gasp]

00:16:59.739 --> 00:17:01.174
It worked.

00:17:02.477 --> 00:17:03.513
What?!

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:08.857
Zamza [thought]: Impossible.
I'm the Superior Being!

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:11.529
How could these rotten humans-

00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:30.299
All: [cheering]

00:17:36.411 --> 00:17:39.886
Zamza: How? How can this be?

00:17:39.919 --> 00:17:43.192
Where did I... go so wrong?

00:17:43.225 --> 00:17:45.597
There was no way I could lose.

00:17:46.966 --> 00:17:48.335
How?!

00:17:49.805 --> 00:17:53.112
Popp: I don't know.
Why don't you ask this guy?

00:17:53.145 --> 00:17:55.617
You underestimated him,
"Mystic Scholar".

00:17:56.451 --> 00:17:57.486
The rat?

00:18:00.694 --> 00:18:01.896
I see.

00:18:01.929 --> 00:18:06.706
All this time... thinking I
was greater and more valuable.

00:18:06.739 --> 00:18:09.778
But the error was in
my heart, wasn't it?

00:18:14.922 --> 00:18:16.158
Popp: Well done, Dai.

00:18:16.191 --> 00:18:18.395
That was an
amazing Avan Strash!

00:18:18.428 --> 00:18:21.736
Yeah. Thanks to the
Sword of Champions...

00:18:27.046 --> 00:18:27.848
Wait...

00:18:27.882 --> 00:18:30.086
Oh, no! Not this one too!

00:18:30.119 --> 00:18:32.190
The power of
the Dragon Crest...

00:18:32.223 --> 00:18:35.063
destroyed one the most
famous weapons ever made?

00:18:35.096 --> 00:18:36.899
No. It is impossible.

00:18:36.933 --> 00:18:39.972
The Sword of Champions, much
like the Crown of Champions

00:18:40.005 --> 00:18:41.843
that I gave you
back on Dermline Island,

00:18:41.876 --> 00:18:45.684
is made from a legendary
metal known as Orichalcum.

00:18:45.717 --> 00:18:49.692
A metal of which the quality
is said to be everlasting!

00:18:49.726 --> 00:18:51.027
Then how?!

00:18:51.061 --> 00:18:53.332
[laughing]

00:18:53.365 --> 00:18:54.802
Sorry to disappoint...

00:18:54.836 --> 00:18:58.175
But that blade is nothing more
than an elaborate fake...

00:18:58.209 --> 00:19:01.048
And the real Sword of
Champions has already

00:19:01.081 --> 00:19:03.553
been delivered to
the Dark Lord Hadlar.

00:19:03.586 --> 00:19:04.789
No! Why, you...

00:19:04.822 --> 00:19:13.138
Zamza: A-And... my mission,
the Supreme Being... study...

00:19:13.171 --> 00:19:15.342
Is now complete!

00:19:17.046 --> 00:19:19.217
What the - what
did you just do?!

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:20.420
[devious chuckle]

00:19:20.453 --> 00:19:22.591
A gift for my father.

00:19:22.624 --> 00:19:26.633
It contains all the results
of my extensive research.

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:29.672
All of the knowledge
that I have recorded...

00:19:29.705 --> 00:19:33.478
With its contents,
he can continue the study into

00:19:33.513 --> 00:19:36.184
the creation of
the Superior Beings.

00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:40.627
You idiot - your father
Zaboera cares for no one!

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:44.568
Even in your final moments-
you still want to impress him?

00:19:46.839 --> 00:19:48.175
I'm aware of that.

00:19:48.208 --> 00:19:49.645
But still...

00:19:49.679 --> 00:19:53.686
I was nothing more than a tool
used to do my maker's bidding.

00:19:53.719 --> 00:19:57.962
And now he will know this
tool served its purpose.

00:19:57.995 --> 00:20:02.938
Zamza: But, despite what
he is, he is still my father.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:04.742
Zamza...

00:20:09.017 --> 00:20:13.726
It's time. This is the fate
of every Superior Being.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:17.066
When we are defeated,
we leave nothing behind.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.872
I shall now
crumble to black ash.

00:20:22.243 --> 00:20:25.083
Perhaps it's punishment
for toying with

00:20:25.116 --> 00:20:26.886
the life the gods gave.

00:20:27.721 --> 00:20:29.057
Zamza...

00:20:29.091 --> 00:20:31.228
Spare me your pity. Human.

00:20:31.262 --> 00:20:32.998
I am still proud...

00:20:33.031 --> 00:20:35.504
of all that I
have accomplished.

00:20:35.537 --> 00:20:37.808
For however brief a moment,

00:20:37.841 --> 00:20:40.880
I was the most powerful
monster to exist.

00:20:40.914 --> 00:20:45.423
And I fought a difficult
battle that most could not.

00:20:45.456 --> 00:20:47.695
But someday... someday,

00:20:47.728 --> 00:20:51.603
another Superior Being
will defeat you all.

00:20:51.636 --> 00:20:56.445
I know... My struggle...
was not in vain.

00:20:56.478 --> 00:21:02.022
That's right. It could not
have been... in... vain...

00:21:08.001 --> 00:21:12.409
All that... All for respect
in the eyes of his father.

00:21:12.443 --> 00:21:16.619
No matter what Zamza said,
somewhere deep in that heart,

00:21:16.652 --> 00:21:19.658
he just wanted to
feel like he was loved.

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:24.033
Dai: I understand.

00:21:25.002 --> 00:21:29.010
I - I know... how he felt.

00:21:36.893 --> 00:21:38.797
Zaboera: [evil laughter]

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:43.673
Well done. Well done
indeed, little Zamza.

00:21:43.706 --> 00:21:47.046
Your life may have been
but a brief two-hundred years,

00:21:47.079 --> 00:21:51.321
my boy, but it has proven
to be quite worthwhile.

00:21:51.355 --> 00:21:53.560
Be proud of what
you have done.

00:21:53.593 --> 00:21:57.133
Your research shall
produce our army's greatest,

00:21:57.166 --> 00:22:00.039
most powerful Overfiend!

00:22:00.072 --> 00:22:03.478
[gleeful cackle]

00:23:37.768 --> 00:23:38.803
Narrator: With new allies

00:23:38.836 --> 00:23:40.774
and formidable
enemies on the horizon,

00:23:40.807 --> 00:23:43.647
Dai and his friends make
their way to Popp's old village

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.185
in search of
a powerful weapon.

00:23:46.218 --> 00:23:47.721
Meanwhile, in Papnica,

00:23:47.754 --> 00:23:50.025
leaders of the Human
Kingdoms have been summoned

00:23:50.058 --> 00:23:52.664
to formulate a plan
against the Dark Army-

00:23:52.698 --> 00:23:55.268
a meeting that gives the
spectral Commander Mystvearn

00:23:55.302 --> 00:23:58.442
the perfect
opportunity to attack.

00:23:58.475 --> 00:23:59.979
Don't miss it - next time, on

00:24:00.012 --> 00:24:02.350
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:02.383 --> 00:24:03.953
"The World Summit"
