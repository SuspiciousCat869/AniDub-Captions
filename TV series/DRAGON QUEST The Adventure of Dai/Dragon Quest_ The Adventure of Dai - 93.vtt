WEBVTT

00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:52.592
True Vearn: Measure
for measure, as they say.

00:01:52.626 --> 00:01:56.198
Now to make you burn in
the fire of my wrath.

00:01:56.801 --> 00:01:58.070
Let's see.

00:01:58.103 --> 00:02:00.007
Yes, I think
I've come up with

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.011
a very entertaining proposal.

00:02:02.044 --> 00:02:03.514
Princess Leona...

00:02:03.547 --> 00:02:07.320
I'll spare you... if you
agree to serve by my side.

00:02:14.903 --> 00:02:16.372
Leona: What?
You can't be serious...

00:02:16.406 --> 00:02:17.875
True Vearn: Oh, but I am.

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.344
You may watch as
this Dragon Knight,

00:02:19.378 --> 00:02:21.082
the only hope
for your human race,

00:02:21.116 --> 00:02:23.319
is viciously torn apart...

00:02:23.353 --> 00:02:25.490
Then, I shall keep
you alive even after

00:02:25.525 --> 00:02:27.428
the Surface World
has been demolished.

00:02:27.461 --> 00:02:29.799
I want you to
witness it all...

00:02:31.402 --> 00:02:32.538
True Vearn: Then you'll spend

00:02:32.572 --> 00:02:34.375
the rest of your
days serving me.

00:02:34.408 --> 00:02:36.479
You shall be an
Underworld songstress,

00:02:36.514 --> 00:02:38.852
singing ballads of
my terrifying power

00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:40.622
and glorious conquests.

00:02:40.655 --> 00:02:42.725
That would be a much
more enjoyable arrangement

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:46.132
than simply slaughtering
you where you stand...

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:47.802
I believe, given time,

00:02:47.835 --> 00:02:50.909
we may even come to enjoy
each other's company.

00:02:50.942 --> 00:02:52.311
What do you think?

00:02:52.344 --> 00:02:55.216
Not a chance. I'll
never do that. Never!

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.591
Did you really think I'd
say yes? I'm not stupid.

00:02:58.624 --> 00:03:01.663
I know if Dai should fall,
I won't live long either.

00:03:01.697 --> 00:03:02.665
So no way.

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:03.601
Leona: Win or lose,

00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:05.070
-I'm fighting by his side...
-L-Leona...

00:03:05.104 --> 00:03:06.807
Until the very end!

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.309
How courageous of you.

00:03:08.343 --> 00:03:10.113
I must say, I'm
impressed, Princess.

00:03:10.146 --> 00:03:12.317
It's a rare thing indeed
for someone so young

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.155
to possess such
an ironclad will.

00:03:14.188 --> 00:03:16.492
You already had me
intrigued, but now...

00:03:16.526 --> 00:03:18.965
I think I like you even more.

00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:20.133
But that will of yours

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:22.338
is of no use to your
precious Dai like this.

00:03:22.371 --> 00:03:23.941
He's on the verge of death.

00:03:23.975 --> 00:03:26.680
You have no hope
of saving him.

00:03:26.714 --> 00:03:30.888
Deny it all you want: this is
not a question of if, but when.

00:03:33.493 --> 00:03:34.797
Only, that's not
quite enough for me.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.600
You see, I don't just
want to kill him -

00:03:36.634 --> 00:03:39.205
I want him completely
and utterly destroyed.

00:03:39.238 --> 00:03:40.675
I want him to see
my greatness,

00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:43.413
along with the limitations
of his own strength...

00:03:43.446 --> 00:03:44.750
True Vearn:
And to finally see

00:03:44.783 --> 00:03:47.487
the true nature of
the humans he so loves.

00:03:47.522 --> 00:03:49.759
I want him to feel
the full weight of despair

00:03:49.793 --> 00:03:52.397
before his bothersome
light is extinguished.

00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:54.368
Now, take a good
look, Princess.

00:03:54.402 --> 00:03:56.439
It will be the last
one you ever get.

00:03:56.473 --> 00:03:59.979
Watch as I grind your
valiant little Hero to dust!

00:04:16.714 --> 00:04:17.648
Dai!

00:04:19.251 --> 00:04:21.256
True Vearn: [laughing]

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:22.759
Come now, what's wrong?

00:04:22.792 --> 00:04:24.863
Are you going to get
up and strike back...

00:04:24.896 --> 00:04:27.835
or are you just going to
writhe around like a worm

00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:30.775
until your time runs out?

00:04:30.808 --> 00:04:32.377
True Vearn [thought]:
Perhaps my Calamitous End

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.582
was too powerful to endure...

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:37.454
Dai [thought]: It's no use.

00:04:37.487 --> 00:04:40.026
I can barely even
move like this...

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:43.534
C'mon... Get up...
Hit him back!

00:04:47.107 --> 00:04:48.911
Leona [thought]:
No, I have to watch.

00:04:48.944 --> 00:04:49.913
It might be brutal...

00:04:49.947 --> 00:04:51.817
but I can't just shut
my eyes and turn away

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.321
while Dai's suffering.
He needs my help.

00:04:54.355 --> 00:04:56.392
I came here to
fight too, didn't I?

00:04:56.425 --> 00:04:58.496
There has to be something
I can do... Anything...

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.568
Anything to get the
Dark King's attention...

00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:02.939
Even if he's distracted
for only a minute,

00:05:02.972 --> 00:05:06.011
it might give Dai a chance
to get back on his feet.

00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:13.660
True Vearn:
Your time has run out.

00:05:22.845 --> 00:05:25.083
Kaiser Phoenix!

00:06:12.311 --> 00:06:14.716
W-Well... tell me...

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.789
How does the mighty Dark King
feel about getting wounded...

00:06:17.822 --> 00:06:19.458
by a princess?

00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:21.195
Did you see that,
Dai? I got him.

00:06:21.228 --> 00:06:24.301
When Vearn's focused, he can't
even be cut by a Gigastrash,

00:06:24.335 --> 00:06:26.405
but when he doesn't give
it his full attention,

00:06:26.438 --> 00:06:28.711
his invulnerability
starts to show cracks.

00:06:28.744 --> 00:06:31.650
If I was able to hurt him
just now, then you can too.

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:34.890
There's nobody in this world
who's completely invincible...

00:06:34.923 --> 00:06:36.727
including the Dark King!

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.165
Don't forget that,
no matter what happens!

00:06:39.198 --> 00:06:40.333
Leona, I...

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:41.770
Leona: If you still
want to keep me alive,

00:06:41.803 --> 00:06:42.872
then go right ahead, Vearn.

00:06:42.906 --> 00:06:45.177
But I promise
you'll regret it...

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.980
Because if you do,

00:06:47.013 --> 00:06:49.285
for the rest of my years,
I'll tell everyone...

00:06:49.318 --> 00:06:50.621
How once upon a time,

00:06:50.654 --> 00:06:53.660
I managed to wound the
infamous Dark King himself...

00:06:53.694 --> 00:06:57.033
How I'm the mightiest woman
in the whole Trio of Worlds!

00:07:05.651 --> 00:07:06.954
Dai [thought]: No, no...

00:07:06.987 --> 00:07:09.225
Get up. You've gotta
to push through this.

00:07:09.258 --> 00:07:10.226
Let's go...

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:12.297
If you don't stand,
right now...

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.034
Then Leona will...

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.742
[roaring]

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:25.658
Leona!

00:07:43.593 --> 00:07:45.565
True Vearn: You
will regret that.

00:07:45.598 --> 00:07:46.867
And to twist the knife,

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.171
you can no longer
resist or even speak.

00:07:49.205 --> 00:07:51.643
Leona, no!

00:08:03.466 --> 00:08:05.938
Dai: You... You turned
her into... a jewel?!

00:08:05.972 --> 00:08:07.976
This is your
punishment, Princess.

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:09.579
How does it feel?

00:08:13.419 --> 00:08:13.955
Leona -

00:08:13.988 --> 00:08:15.056
[groan]

00:08:19.732 --> 00:08:20.668
Leona: Where am I?

00:08:20.701 --> 00:08:21.703
What happened to me?!

00:08:21.736 --> 00:08:23.073
I... I'm stuck...

00:08:23.106 --> 00:08:24.408
You decided to wound me,

00:08:24.442 --> 00:08:27.948
and for such a slight, simply
killing you wouldn't be enough.

00:08:27.982 --> 00:08:31.288
No, I won't be satisfied
unless you suffer a fate...

00:08:31.321 --> 00:08:33.459
that's even worse than death.

00:08:33.493 --> 00:08:36.432
I've used my Magic Power
to transform you into

00:08:36.466 --> 00:08:38.937
a type of jewel
known as an Eye.

00:08:38.971 --> 00:08:41.008
Now that you're locked
within this gemstone,

00:08:41.042 --> 00:08:43.781
there are only three things
you'll be able to do:

00:08:43.814 --> 00:08:46.251
You can see, hear, and think.

00:08:46.285 --> 00:08:47.889
However, you cannot move.

00:08:47.922 --> 00:08:51.328
Your voice cannot be
heard by anyone but me...

00:08:51.362 --> 00:08:53.768
True Vearn: No matter what
scenes of atrocity may unfold

00:08:53.801 --> 00:08:55.737
before you in these
next few moments...

00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:58.376
you cannot avert
your gaze, either...

00:08:58.409 --> 00:09:01.181
This is your cage,
my songbird.

00:09:09.098 --> 00:09:10.701
Congratulations, Dai.

00:09:10.735 --> 00:09:13.372
Despite the fact that
you're heavily wounded,

00:09:13.405 --> 00:09:14.976
you still refuse
to accept defeat.

00:09:15.009 --> 00:09:17.715
Perhaps you're worthy
of fighting me, after all.

00:09:20.386 --> 00:09:21.355
Leona: Dai!

00:09:21.389 --> 00:09:22.792
Dai, help!

00:09:22.825 --> 00:09:25.096
I'll get you out,
Leona. Hang on!

00:09:30.741 --> 00:09:32.244
Let's get started
then, shall we?

00:09:32.277 --> 00:09:33.648
Watch from there, Princess...

00:09:33.681 --> 00:09:35.785
and behold as I thrash
your intrepid Hero

00:09:35.818 --> 00:09:37.522
beyond all hope of victory.

00:09:37.555 --> 00:09:38.924
You cannot fight by his side,

00:09:38.957 --> 00:09:41.496
nor can you take your own
life to spare yourself

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:42.798
the shame of helplessness...

00:09:42.831 --> 00:09:44.502
For a leader of
the Surface World,

00:09:44.536 --> 00:09:46.205
I can think of no
greater humiliation.

00:09:46.239 --> 00:09:47.741
Wouldn't you agree?

00:09:49.044 --> 00:09:52.150
However, I'm more than
willing to change you back

00:09:52.184 --> 00:09:54.956
once you agree to pledge
eternal servitude to me.

00:09:54.989 --> 00:09:56.325
True Vearn: [evil laughter]

00:09:56.359 --> 00:09:57.962
Turn her back - right now!

00:09:58.731 --> 00:10:00.099
If you want me to do that,

00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:01.769
you'll have to stop
my Magic Power.

00:10:01.803 --> 00:10:04.474
Defeat me once and for all,
and she'll be restored.

00:10:04.509 --> 00:10:08.750
Although, in your condition,
that seems rather unlikely.

00:10:08.783 --> 00:10:11.121
Dai [thought]: Even if he's
right, I have to beat him.

00:10:11.155 --> 00:10:14.930
Unless I finish this here and
now, then... Leona will...

00:10:14.963 --> 00:10:16.700
But how am I supposed
to get through his

00:10:16.733 --> 00:10:18.403
Demonic Guard of
Heaven and Earth?

00:10:18.436 --> 00:10:20.674
It doesn't have a weakness!

00:10:22.745 --> 00:10:23.714
Dai [thought]: That's it...

00:10:23.747 --> 00:10:25.450
If there's no
weakness, then...

00:10:25.483 --> 00:10:26.886
Then, maybe...

00:10:28.055 --> 00:10:28.890
True Vearn [thought]: I know
that look all too well...

00:10:28.924 --> 00:10:31.095
He's thought of something.

00:10:31.129 --> 00:10:32.865
Dai [thought]: But
I can't do it alone.

00:10:32.898 --> 00:10:34.836
That's the real
reason he took her...

00:10:34.869 --> 00:10:36.840
What are you waiting for?
Is something wrong?

00:10:36.874 --> 00:10:38.042
It certainly looked as if

00:10:38.076 --> 00:10:40.882
you just came up with
some way to fight back.

00:10:40.915 --> 00:10:44.487
At any rate, I suppose
it doesn't matter.

00:10:44.522 --> 00:10:47.762
Whatever you choose, you'll
still be torn apart by this.

00:10:47.795 --> 00:10:49.365
Wait... Calamitous End?!

00:10:49.398 --> 00:10:50.366
[chuckling]

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:52.237
Come now. Don't be
so surprised.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:54.942
The Demonic Guard of Heaven
and Earth isn't necessary

00:10:54.976 --> 00:10:58.216
for a Kaiser Phoenix or
Calamitous Wall attack.

00:10:58.249 --> 00:11:00.286
The almighty power
of my palm strike

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.228
can also be unleashed
at any time I require.

00:11:04.261 --> 00:11:08.102
Besides, why should I use my
ultimate skill against someone

00:11:08.135 --> 00:11:10.575
who has lost their
will to fight?

00:11:10.608 --> 00:11:13.078
I shall tear you to shreds!

00:11:24.836 --> 00:11:28.510
Leona: Oh, Dai...
This... This isn't good.

00:11:28.544 --> 00:11:30.915
Look at you. You can
barely even stand.

00:11:30.948 --> 00:11:33.018
To be powerless
at a time like this...

00:11:33.052 --> 00:11:36.659
To be forced to just watch
while he's wearing you down...

00:11:36.693 --> 00:11:38.096
[cackling]

00:11:38.129 --> 00:11:39.866
That's it!
Very good, Princess.

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:41.736
Now I feel your torment!

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:43.405
True Vearn: To savor
a wine so sweet,

00:11:43.439 --> 00:11:47.915
even for a fleeting instant,
makes this all the more fun!

00:11:50.386 --> 00:11:53.125
[pained groan]

00:11:53.159 --> 00:11:55.430
True Vearn: You should
know that my last attack

00:11:55.463 --> 00:11:58.102
was only a simple palm strike.

00:11:58.737 --> 00:12:00.040
Make no mistake,

00:12:00.073 --> 00:12:02.845
my Calamitous End is a far
greater attack than that.

00:12:02.878 --> 00:12:05.851
It requires every ounce
of my supreme might.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.189
Allow me to demonstrate.

00:12:08.223 --> 00:12:09.225
Leona: Dai, don't -

00:12:09.258 --> 00:12:12.297
True Vearn: Can you
withstand... a second one?

00:12:14.803 --> 00:12:22.317
[roaring]

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:23.654
Leona: Please, please move!

00:12:23.687 --> 00:12:26.058
Calamitous... End!

00:12:39.752 --> 00:12:41.956
Calamitous... End!

00:12:57.922 --> 00:12:59.759
Popp: Sorry about that,
Mister Dark King.

00:12:59.793 --> 00:13:01.328
Hate to interrupt...

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:03.867
Not you again...

00:13:06.438 --> 00:13:07.140
Yeah, us again.

00:13:07.173 --> 00:13:08.710
And if you want to beat Dai,

00:13:08.743 --> 00:13:10.580
you'll have to
get through us first.

00:13:10.614 --> 00:13:14.054
'Cause it's not really over
until you do, now is it?

00:13:14.087 --> 00:13:16.124
Everybody, you're all here!

00:13:18.062 --> 00:13:19.598
True Vearn: Meddlesome
little brats...

00:13:20.667 --> 00:13:22.171
Begone with you!

00:13:22.204 --> 00:13:24.474
Watch out, guys.
His third eye's about to -

00:13:33.627 --> 00:13:35.664
[cackling]

00:13:35.697 --> 00:13:37.134
Say what you will,
but it looks like

00:13:37.167 --> 00:13:39.004
you barely even had
the strength to get here,

00:13:39.038 --> 00:13:40.975
let alone stand in my way.

00:13:41.008 --> 00:13:44.080
Only the ones who are worthy of
the challenge may face me...

00:13:44.114 --> 00:13:49.592
Dai, Popp, Avan,
Hym, and Larhart...

00:13:49.626 --> 00:13:51.896
The five of you
make the mark.

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:53.900
What's happening here?
Where'd the others go?

00:13:53.934 --> 00:13:55.403
It's what I was
trying to tell you.

00:13:55.437 --> 00:13:57.040
When the light from
Vearn's third eye

00:13:57.073 --> 00:13:58.977
hits anybody who's
too weak to fight him,

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:00.580
it turns them into
those jewels -

00:14:00.614 --> 00:14:03.953
He did the same thing to
Leona, before you got here.

00:14:03.987 --> 00:14:07.761
You're telling me everyone
else is stuck in these things?

00:14:07.795 --> 00:14:09.999
Hyunckel: Terrifying
Magic Power...

00:14:10.901 --> 00:14:11.870
Maam: Great...

00:14:11.903 --> 00:14:12.905
Crocodine: To
come all this way

00:14:12.939 --> 00:14:14.676
and not even get to
swing my axe...

00:14:14.709 --> 00:14:15.577
Useless!

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:17.146
Chiu: et me out!

00:14:20.621 --> 00:14:21.956
Popp [thought]:
That's right...

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.328
Hyunckel was already in
critical condition...

00:14:24.361 --> 00:14:26.533
Maam and Brokeena
were still recovering

00:14:26.566 --> 00:14:27.902
after the battle with Myst...

00:14:27.936 --> 00:14:29.270
And, sad to say it,

00:14:29.304 --> 00:14:32.243
but I guess Chiu and Big Guy
just weren't strong enough.

00:14:32.276 --> 00:14:33.881
There's a huge
difference between

00:14:33.914 --> 00:14:35.550
Big Guy and Chiu, though...

00:14:35.584 --> 00:14:37.220
I mean, Chiu I get, but...

00:14:37.253 --> 00:14:40.026
is it seriously
all the same to Vearn?

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.130
Do we know if they're
still alive in there?

00:14:42.163 --> 00:14:44.502
Yeah. They just
can't do anything.

00:14:44.535 --> 00:14:48.042
Huh, well... Great. That might
actually work better.

00:14:48.075 --> 00:14:49.845
"Work better"?
What are you talking about?

00:14:49.879 --> 00:14:51.048
How is this at all better?

00:14:51.081 --> 00:14:52.952
Don't you care that
he's got your friends?

00:14:52.985 --> 00:14:54.689
You aren't making
a lot of sense.

00:14:54.722 --> 00:14:56.391
There's a way to turn
'em back, right?

00:14:56.424 --> 00:14:59.197
But Vearn said defeating him
was the only way to do it.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.234
Popp: Well,
he's the Dark King.

00:15:01.268 --> 00:15:03.072
We won't be able to
cover our wounded

00:15:03.105 --> 00:15:05.243
and take him on at
the same time.

00:15:05.276 --> 00:15:06.078
That is true...

00:15:06.111 --> 00:15:07.480
Popp: Well, now we
don't have to.

00:15:07.515 --> 00:15:09.819
From the looks of it, those
jewels aren't going to break

00:15:09.852 --> 00:15:11.389
if they get caught
in the fight.

00:15:11.422 --> 00:15:12.457
So what I'm thinking is,

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.428
Maam and the Princess
are actually safer.

00:15:14.461 --> 00:15:16.365
At least now they're
out of harm's way -

00:15:16.398 --> 00:15:18.937
we won't have to
worry about them.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:20.306
I know it's a
little heartless,

00:15:20.339 --> 00:15:22.744
but defeating Vearn is going
to be easier like this...

00:15:22.778 --> 00:15:24.648
that's the only
thing that matters.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.788
Oh? Excuse me.

00:15:27.822 --> 00:15:28.957
You're always
whining so much,

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.095
I assumed you'd be more
sentimental is all.

00:15:31.128 --> 00:15:32.430
Hym: Turns out you're
pretty level-headed.

00:15:32.463 --> 00:15:34.168
Duh. It depends on
the situation!

00:15:34.201 --> 00:15:35.436
Anyway, let's stay focused.

00:15:35.469 --> 00:15:37.741
If we lose here, the
Surface World is done for...

00:15:37.775 --> 00:15:41.248
Our friends won't be coming
back if we let that happen.

00:15:43.754 --> 00:15:45.189
Avan [thought]: Matoriv?

00:15:46.425 --> 00:15:48.195
Popp: We still have a shot at
bringing down the Dark King

00:15:48.229 --> 00:15:49.565
and rescuing the others...

00:15:49.598 --> 00:15:52.436
I'll do anything it takes,
no matter what it costs me.

00:15:53.105 --> 00:15:54.575
Avan [thought]: I see.

00:15:54.609 --> 00:15:57.848
He's been instructing
Popp while I was gone.

00:15:57.881 --> 00:15:59.619
It's no wonder his
magical abilities

00:15:59.652 --> 00:16:01.689
have grown so tremendously.

00:16:01.723 --> 00:16:04.127
It's just like
the old days...

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.266
It feels like the Grand Sorcerer
is right here beside me,

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.574
ready to face the forces
of Darkness yet again.

00:16:15.584 --> 00:16:16.552
Before you know it,

00:16:16.586 --> 00:16:18.957
they've all grown up and
come into their own...

00:16:18.991 --> 00:16:21.095
Time moves quickly.

00:16:21.128 --> 00:16:23.666
Popp [thought]:
Be cool... Be cool...

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.639
Now's the time to fight like
Mentor, so keep it together.

00:16:26.672 --> 00:16:29.278
Since Vearn is able
to deflect my Medroa,

00:16:29.311 --> 00:16:31.583
there's only got one
thing I've got left.

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:32.919
My mind is sharp.

00:16:32.952 --> 00:16:35.023
It's gotten us out
of so many tight spots.

00:16:35.056 --> 00:16:36.592
Think it through, Popp.

00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:43.272
True Vearn: I suppose the
bigger the audience the better.

00:16:43.306 --> 00:16:45.744
You may have to witness
the fall of your Hero,

00:16:45.777 --> 00:16:47.347
and the hope of
your Surface World

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.052
shall perish
along with him...

00:16:50.085 --> 00:16:53.526
But nevertheless, you should
all be very proud...

00:16:58.536 --> 00:17:00.841
Because you're about
to witness history...

00:17:00.874 --> 00:17:03.145
The dawn of a new era.

00:17:04.883 --> 00:17:06.619
True Vearn: Cry, heavens!

00:17:20.179 --> 00:17:22.083
True Vearn: Howl, earth!

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.944
True Vearn: Here and now...

00:17:35.978 --> 00:17:39.350
The age of darkness
has come at last!

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:44.929
Now witness this...
my ultimate power!

00:17:44.963 --> 00:17:45.931
That stance, it's...

00:17:45.964 --> 00:17:47.602
Look alive, Popp.
Heal Master Dai!

00:17:47.635 --> 00:17:48.269
Right!

00:17:48.302 --> 00:17:50.039
Okay, let's use that time...

00:17:50.072 --> 00:17:51.743
To keep him busy. I like it.

00:17:51.776 --> 00:17:52.944
No, wait a second!

00:17:52.978 --> 00:17:55.518
Do not charge into his Demonic
Guard of Heaven and Earth!

00:17:55.551 --> 00:17:56.553
Wha...

00:17:56.586 --> 00:17:58.222
That's the ultimate
power he's talking about.

00:17:58.256 --> 00:17:59.525
I've already seen it once.

00:17:59.559 --> 00:18:02.263
Trust me, not even
the three of you could...

00:18:02.931 --> 00:18:03.833
Please, don't -

00:18:05.771 --> 00:18:06.839
Popp, what are you doing?

00:18:06.872 --> 00:18:08.577
Let go. We have to stop them!

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:09.745
J-Just sit still!

00:18:15.524 --> 00:18:17.027
Avan Strash!

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.097
Sunder Claw!

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:20.800
Aura Knuckle!

00:18:22.403 --> 00:18:25.810
True Vearn: Demonic Guard
of Heaven and Earth!

00:18:31.187 --> 00:18:36.498
[agonized howls]

00:18:39.705 --> 00:18:42.511
True Vearn: [laughing]

00:18:42.545 --> 00:18:45.717
Was that really the best you
three could do together?

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:46.753
Disappointing.

00:18:46.786 --> 00:18:48.857
At least Dai's Gigastrash
managed to wound me.

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.294
I barely even felt
your attacks.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.303
Popp [thought]: I saw it.

00:18:55.336 --> 00:18:57.841
He repelled the Sunder Claw
with the force of his palm...

00:18:57.874 --> 00:19:01.147
took care of the Avan Strash
with his Kaiser Phoenix...

00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:02.316
and shattered
the Aura Knuckle

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.420
with a strike
from his other palm.

00:19:05.356 --> 00:19:06.893
Popp [thought]: Attack,
defense, and magic

00:19:06.926 --> 00:19:08.395
all in a single motion.

00:19:08.429 --> 00:19:11.001
Talk about ultimate power.

00:19:11.034 --> 00:19:11.937
But why, Popp?

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:13.272
Why wouldn't you let me go?

00:19:13.305 --> 00:19:14.407
I could've saved them.

00:19:14.441 --> 00:19:15.811
How could you
abandon our friends?

00:19:15.844 --> 00:19:18.850
That stance Vearn's using
is totally unbeatable

00:19:18.883 --> 00:19:19.552
I knew that,

00:19:19.585 --> 00:19:21.254
which is why I was going to...

00:19:23.726 --> 00:19:26.064
They're alive!
That was way too close.

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:27.634
We have to help
them, before...

00:19:29.337 --> 00:19:31.375
Popp [thought]: Why doesn't
he finish them off?

00:19:31.408 --> 00:19:33.647
I don't get it.
They're all in shambles...

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.986
He could probably wipe them out
with a single extreme spell.

00:19:37.019 --> 00:19:39.358
Instead, he's just
standing there.

00:19:39.391 --> 00:19:43.098
Is he playing with them?
No, that's not it.

00:19:43.131 --> 00:19:45.236
He isn't giving any openings.

00:19:45.269 --> 00:19:48.643
Could... Could it be?

00:19:48.677 --> 00:19:51.081
Now, then...
What will it be next?

00:19:51.114 --> 00:19:53.385
Will you give up and
beg for your puny lives?

00:19:53.418 --> 00:19:54.788
Or will you stand,

00:19:54.822 --> 00:19:59.097
and face the terrifying fury
of my attack one more time?

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.034
Well, b-be that as it may...

00:20:01.067 --> 00:20:03.472
Given that choice,
there's no choice!

00:20:03.506 --> 00:20:06.545
You got that right.
We'll take our chances.

00:20:07.279 --> 00:20:08.917
That's what I was hoping for.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:12.991
Only... it looks like one of
you won't be able to join us.

00:20:15.329 --> 00:20:16.599
Master Avan!

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.415
Master, no!

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.657
I have to admit it, Avan.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:32.330
I'm rather grateful that you
were the first opponent to fall.

00:20:32.363 --> 00:20:33.498
Fighting power aside,

00:20:33.533 --> 00:20:35.236
you mustn't be
underestimated.

00:20:35.269 --> 00:20:36.605
Your mind is like no other.

00:20:36.639 --> 00:20:39.044
You're unpredictable,
dangerously observant...

00:20:39.077 --> 00:20:40.246
and perhaps the smartest man

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.752
to have ever walked
the Surface World.

00:20:42.785 --> 00:20:44.053
Unfortunately for you...

00:20:44.086 --> 00:20:45.289
there's still
someone who's even

00:20:45.322 --> 00:20:47.828
smarter than me
standing in our midst.

00:20:53.072 --> 00:20:54.508
M-Master!

00:20:54.541 --> 00:20:57.013
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I... I...

00:20:57.046 --> 00:20:59.686
I understand why
you held Dai back

00:20:59.719 --> 00:21:01.956
despite knowing what
would happen to us.

00:21:01.989 --> 00:21:04.227
You made the right call, Popp.

00:21:04.261 --> 00:21:05.731
Avan: Only a strike
from the Hero

00:21:05.764 --> 00:21:08.002
will be able to
defeat the Dark King.

00:21:08.035 --> 00:21:11.509
You were following the same
advice I gave Princess Leona.

00:21:11.543 --> 00:21:14.882
You set aside your feelings
to ensure the victory.

00:21:15.917 --> 00:21:17.554
Avan: Just as Dai, the Hero,

00:21:17.588 --> 00:21:20.058
is the only one who can
defeat the Dark King...

00:21:20.092 --> 00:21:21.328
there's only one
person who can

00:21:21.362 --> 00:21:23.600
help him unlock his
full potential...

00:21:23.633 --> 00:21:25.604
and that person is
the one who's been...

00:21:25.637 --> 00:21:28.308
fighting by him ever
since the beginning.

00:21:28.341 --> 00:21:29.410
And that's you.

00:21:29.443 --> 00:21:31.080
I-It's always been you, Popp.

00:21:34.655 --> 00:21:37.093
Remember to work together...

00:21:37.127 --> 00:21:38.663
and win this thing.

00:21:41.001 --> 00:21:43.773
All: Master!

00:22:00.105 --> 00:22:04.080
Both: Master Avan!

00:23:37.634 --> 00:23:39.404
Narrator: With Avan
and most of the party

00:23:39.437 --> 00:23:40.607
turned into Eye Jewels,

00:23:40.641 --> 00:23:42.443
Dai and his remaining
forces are battered by

00:23:42.477 --> 00:23:43.880
Vearn's unstoppable might.

00:23:43.914 --> 00:23:46.284
Before long only Dai
and Popp are left,

00:23:46.317 --> 00:23:48.890
and the others are helpless
to do anything but watch.

00:23:48.923 --> 00:23:51.060
Victory has never
seemed further away...

00:23:51.094 --> 00:23:54.067
until Popp devises a
last-ditch effort to overcome

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.606
the Dark King's Demonic
Guard of Heaven and Earth.

00:23:56.639 --> 00:23:58.643
See if he'll succeed
on the next episode of

00:23:58.676 --> 00:24:01.081
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:01.114 --> 00:24:02.449
"On This Bond."
