WEBVTT

00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:05.016
He's really gone.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.219
Popp [thought]: Hadlar...

00:02:06.252 --> 00:02:08.925
I hope you know that
in your last moments,

00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.229
you became one of us.

00:02:11.263 --> 00:02:13.233
You were our friend,

00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:15.103
and we will remember you.

00:02:15.136 --> 00:02:16.472
Avan: Up you go.

00:02:25.023 --> 00:02:27.128
I'll say, you
sure have grown a bit.

00:02:27.161 --> 00:02:28.263
Haven't you, Popp?

00:02:28.296 --> 00:02:30.234
You're almost too
heavy for me to carry.

00:02:30.267 --> 00:02:31.503
[chuckling]

00:02:32.572 --> 00:02:33.273
Put me down!

00:02:33.306 --> 00:02:34.275
Avan: Easy now...

00:02:34.308 --> 00:02:35.177
You're not him...

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.445
You can't be our Master.

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:38.349
The real Avan would
never have left us

00:02:38.383 --> 00:02:40.453
to fend for
ourselves all this time.

00:02:40.487 --> 00:02:42.559
You are just an illusion!

00:02:42.592 --> 00:02:43.560
For all we know,

00:02:43.594 --> 00:02:46.499
you might even be
Zaboera in disguise again.

00:02:46.534 --> 00:02:48.771
No, he's not.
That isn't possible.

00:02:49.973 --> 00:02:52.846
You're in a Magic
Circle of Light.

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.148
No matter the disguise,

00:02:54.182 --> 00:02:56.318
nothing evil can
stand within it.

00:02:56.352 --> 00:02:59.391
No Dark Magic in
existence will work.

00:03:01.428 --> 00:03:02.966
If that's true...
Doesn't it...

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:04.435
Doesn't it mean that...

00:03:04.468 --> 00:03:06.706
It's... It's really him.

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:16.258
[excited chirp]

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:21.202
I don't believe it.

00:03:21.235 --> 00:03:22.404
Well, it's true.

00:03:22.438 --> 00:03:24.108
I hope you can
all forgive me

00:03:24.141 --> 00:03:26.112
for causing you
so much concern...

00:03:26.145 --> 00:03:27.347
There's much to explain,

00:03:27.381 --> 00:03:29.820
but I am neither a ghost,
nor an illusion -

00:03:29.853 --> 00:03:31.456
nor an imposter...

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.228
And I'm obviously not
a twin, or anything.

00:03:34.262 --> 00:03:37.268
It's no trick.
It's really me.

00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:38.203
Dai: Master Avan!

00:03:38.236 --> 00:03:39.338
How did you do it?

00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:41.242
[overjoyed chirps]

00:03:41.275 --> 00:03:42.378
Dai: It's you.

00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:44.414
Popp: You're back!

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.710
That's right.
Howling Inferno!

00:04:19.987 --> 00:04:21.323
Take this.

00:04:21.356 --> 00:04:23.694
Northern Grand Blade!

00:04:29.204 --> 00:04:30.842
Queen Flora -
you look troubled.

00:04:30.875 --> 00:04:32.277
What's the matter?

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.682
I can sense a new presence...

00:04:34.716 --> 00:04:35.885
Up there.

00:04:39.826 --> 00:04:40.562
But how?

00:04:40.595 --> 00:04:41.229
Tell us.

00:04:41.262 --> 00:04:42.698
Popp: Yeah, spill!

00:04:44.068 --> 00:04:45.069
Avan: Dai...

00:04:45.738 --> 00:04:47.108
Maam...

00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:48.911
Popp.

00:04:48.944 --> 00:04:50.581
Where have you been?!

00:04:50.615 --> 00:04:53.520
Relax. You're getting
my only good cloak wet!

00:04:53.554 --> 00:04:55.257
Whatever. I can't help it.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.927
I never thought
I'd see you again.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.496
Your cloak'll dry out.
Just let me hug you, all right?

00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:00.835
That's enough for now.
Down you go.

00:05:02.304 --> 00:05:03.541
You know, Popp...

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:06.680
I could sense your Magic
Power from a long way off.

00:05:06.713 --> 00:05:09.752
It's become truly impressive.

00:05:09.786 --> 00:05:12.625
Well, you said it yourself.
I've grown quite a bit.

00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:14.596
He sure has.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.032
Avan: And look
at that armor...

00:05:16.065 --> 00:05:18.937
Maam. I never expected that you
would take up Martial Arts.

00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:20.406
Quite the surprise.

00:05:21.376 --> 00:05:23.113
And Dai...

00:05:23.146 --> 00:05:24.414
There's no denying it.

00:05:24.448 --> 00:05:27.387
You've truly earned the
Hero's title. Well done.

00:05:27.421 --> 00:05:28.657
[flattered chuckle]

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.164
You've all... changed
so much since we last met.

00:05:32.197 --> 00:05:34.268
I wish I'd played
a bigger part...

00:05:34.302 --> 00:05:35.872
but to see how
far you've come,

00:05:35.905 --> 00:05:39.111
relying on nothing except
your own strength...

00:05:39.144 --> 00:05:41.382
I couldn't be more
proud of you...

00:05:42.417 --> 00:05:43.787
All of you.

00:05:50.133 --> 00:05:51.803
Hyunckel, too.

00:05:54.274 --> 00:05:55.611
Leona: Hyunckel...

00:05:55.644 --> 00:05:57.381
I know that you've
devoted yourself

00:05:57.414 --> 00:05:59.519
to a never-ending
battle, but...

00:05:59.553 --> 00:06:00.788
even the greatest warriors

00:06:00.821 --> 00:06:03.761
are allowed to express
their feelings sometimes.

00:06:03.794 --> 00:06:07.902
I'm not... I'm not hiding
my feelings, Princess.

00:06:07.935 --> 00:06:11.075
It's just, after
everything I've done...

00:06:11.108 --> 00:06:12.512
Hyunckel [thought]:
I suppose...

00:06:12.545 --> 00:06:14.950
this is what people
mean when they say...

00:06:14.983 --> 00:06:17.855
They're too ashamed
to show their face.

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:20.059
Young Hyunckel: Bartos
was the strongest knight

00:06:20.093 --> 00:06:21.864
in all of the Dark Army...

00:06:21.897 --> 00:06:23.668
and he was my father.

00:06:23.701 --> 00:06:24.702
[gasp]

00:06:24.736 --> 00:06:27.708
And so the malice that
you sense in my blade?

00:06:27.742 --> 00:06:31.382
It's my hatred towards
you for murdering him!

00:06:31.415 --> 00:06:33.185
Wait a minute! Hyunckel!

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:34.789
[roaring]

00:06:35.859 --> 00:06:38.129
The truth is, not
all students of Avan

00:06:38.162 --> 00:06:41.937
respect their teacher and
love justice like you three.

00:06:41.971 --> 00:06:47.080
Some of us love chaos and have
embraced the darkness instead.

00:06:47.113 --> 00:06:49.385
After seeing just how weak...

00:06:49.418 --> 00:06:51.657
justice really is!

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:52.692
But...

00:06:53.293 --> 00:06:55.831
My name is Hyunckel.

00:06:55.865 --> 00:06:58.571
One of the Six Commanders
of the Dark Army;

00:06:58.604 --> 00:07:01.008
leader of the Undead Legion!

00:07:06.485 --> 00:07:08.489
Hyunckel [thought]:
I might regret my past,

00:07:08.524 --> 00:07:10.995
but I still don't
deserve your forgiveness.

00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:16.305
Hey... Enjoy it while you can.

00:07:16.338 --> 00:07:18.009
This might be our
only chance to see

00:07:18.042 --> 00:07:20.782
mister tough-guy Hyunckel
opening up the waterworks.

00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:23.186
I didn't think he
even had a soft side.

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:24.221
Popp, c'mon.

00:07:24.255 --> 00:07:25.858
Cut it out.
Don't be such a jerk.

00:07:25.891 --> 00:07:28.229
Yeah, you're right.
Maybe he just needs a hug.

00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:32.137
Leave him be. We all
have our regrets.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.642
Master, Hyunckel was only...

00:07:35.243 --> 00:07:36.546
It's all right, Maam.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.850
You don't need
to explain a thing.

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:43.026
Avan [thought]: Hyunckel...

00:07:43.059 --> 00:07:44.461
the past is behind us.

00:07:44.495 --> 00:07:46.231
All that matters
now is you're here,

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:48.971
and you're giving your
strength to help the others.

00:07:49.004 --> 00:07:52.512
You're becoming the man I
always knew you could be...

00:07:52.545 --> 00:07:55.884
And that... That alone
brings me great joy.

00:07:56.452 --> 00:07:58.322
Hi, Master Avan.

00:07:58.356 --> 00:07:59.959
Oh, Princess Leona.

00:07:59.992 --> 00:08:02.197
You've joined my
Disciples as well?

00:08:03.767 --> 00:08:05.805
Leona: Queen Flora
gave me this Insignia.

00:08:05.838 --> 00:08:08.042
You can have it
back if you want.

00:08:08.442 --> 00:08:09.846
No, not at all.

00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:13.486
If she deemed you worthy of it,
then I trust her judgement.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.457
Thank you, I'm honored.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.762
But could you please
explain something to me?

00:08:17.796 --> 00:08:20.501
There's no spell in existence
that can resurrect completely-

00:08:20.535 --> 00:08:21.870
so how are you here?

00:08:24.207 --> 00:08:25.243
We were told -

00:08:25.276 --> 00:08:27.681
you sacrificed yourself
on Dermline Island, right?

00:08:27.715 --> 00:08:29.920
So you could rescue
Dai and Popp.

00:08:29.953 --> 00:08:31.957
Dai [thought]:
That's what happened.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.259
We both saw it.

00:08:33.293 --> 00:08:35.463
[roaring]

00:08:35.496 --> 00:08:40.073
[agonized cry]

00:08:40.106 --> 00:08:42.545
A spell?! Impossible!

00:08:43.714 --> 00:08:44.850
There's no way
you've conserved

00:08:44.883 --> 00:08:47.087
enough Magic Power for this.

00:08:48.991 --> 00:08:51.061
Actually, this spell
requires very little.

00:08:51.095 --> 00:08:54.335
Instead, it turns life
energy into a massive blast.

00:08:54.368 --> 00:08:56.305
So let's see you
withstand this, Hadlar!

00:08:56.338 --> 00:08:59.579
Wait! You know
what that means -

00:09:01.115 --> 00:09:03.452
Stop it! You little...

00:09:03.486 --> 00:09:05.490
[roaring]

00:09:05.524 --> 00:09:07.528
Popp, Dai - good luck!

00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:09.599
You'll have to
take it from here.

00:09:09.633 --> 00:09:11.101
[roaring]

00:09:11.135 --> 00:09:12.939
No!

00:09:12.972 --> 00:09:16.044
[furious roar]

00:09:17.948 --> 00:09:19.217
Avan: Megante!

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.802
Yeah, that's right.

00:09:27.835 --> 00:09:30.808
We watched him put everything
on the line to protect us...

00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:33.647
By casting a Megante spell...

00:09:33.681 --> 00:09:36.687
But if anyone other than
a Priest uses Megante,

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.124
their body is reduced
to nothing but dust

00:09:39.158 --> 00:09:42.130
and it should be
impossible to resurrect them.

00:09:49.846 --> 00:09:52.852
I don't mean to question
what you're capable of...

00:09:52.885 --> 00:09:55.724
I just don't understand
how you did it.

00:09:56.827 --> 00:09:58.295
Avan: Well, Leona...

00:09:58.329 --> 00:10:00.801
it's actually very simple.

00:10:00.835 --> 00:10:03.106
Because I never
really died at all!

00:10:03.139 --> 00:10:04.341
What?!

00:10:28.322 --> 00:10:29.792
I'm sure it comes as a shock,

00:10:29.826 --> 00:10:32.030
but I've been alive
this entire time.

00:10:34.335 --> 00:10:37.274
But... But, after the
fight, you were gone...

00:10:37.307 --> 00:10:38.778
And now I'm here.

00:10:38.811 --> 00:10:40.515
But, how? We both saw it...

00:10:40.548 --> 00:10:41.950
And yet here I stand.

00:10:41.984 --> 00:10:44.555
But after they told me,
we all mourned you together.

00:10:44.589 --> 00:10:46.225
Fooled you all, didn't I?

00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:52.371
What... Wait a
minute. Seriously?

00:10:52.404 --> 00:10:53.908
Now I'm more confused.

00:10:53.941 --> 00:10:55.110
How is that possible?

00:10:55.143 --> 00:10:57.480
Honestly, it's
not that complicated.

00:10:57.514 --> 00:10:58.683
A long time ago,

00:10:58.717 --> 00:11:01.723
Queen Flora left me with
a gift, much like yours.

00:11:01.756 --> 00:11:05.396
Here it is - the only
reason I'm still standing.

00:11:06.766 --> 00:11:08.436
What is it?

00:11:08.469 --> 00:11:11.743
Avan: A very
powerful treasure.

00:11:11.777 --> 00:11:14.649
Flora: Meanwhile,
I'd like you to have this.

00:11:14.683 --> 00:11:16.118
It's the Amulet of Carl -

00:11:16.151 --> 00:11:18.623
an heirloom of
the royal family.

00:11:18.657 --> 00:11:21.028
I'm sure its enchantment
will help you someday.

00:11:21.061 --> 00:11:22.363
Avan: Back when we were young,

00:11:22.397 --> 00:11:24.902
and I set off to face
the Dark Lord Hadlar,

00:11:24.936 --> 00:11:26.840
Queen Flora gave it to me.

00:11:26.873 --> 00:11:28.877
She hoped it would
offer protection.

00:11:30.112 --> 00:11:31.348
Avan: Megante!

00:11:35.256 --> 00:11:37.595
Avan: After I cast
the Megante spell,

00:11:37.628 --> 00:11:39.164
the charm absorbed
the blast...

00:11:39.197 --> 00:11:42.136
and the amulet took most
of the damage in my place.

00:11:55.998 --> 00:11:57.134
Avan: So, in the end...

00:11:57.167 --> 00:11:59.772
it did exactly what
Flora hoped it would.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.916
It was a close call,
but I managed to survive...

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:07.988
and it was only because
I wear this every day.

00:12:11.095 --> 00:12:12.097
But...

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:12.931
Then...

00:12:12.965 --> 00:12:15.003
Why did you wait
so long to show up?

00:12:15.036 --> 00:12:17.909
We really could've used
your help! I mean...

00:12:17.942 --> 00:12:20.013
Do you have any
idea what we've risked -

00:12:20.046 --> 00:12:23.085
how much we've all given
up to carry on your fight?

00:12:23.119 --> 00:12:25.791
Are you telling us that you
knew this whole time...

00:12:25.825 --> 00:12:27.461
and you just did nothing?!

00:12:27.494 --> 00:12:28.697
He's right.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:30.399
How could you let us
all grieve you like that?

00:12:30.433 --> 00:12:33.005
I was heartbroken when
I heard you were gone.

00:12:33.039 --> 00:12:34.943
Maam: We all fought
so hard for you.

00:12:34.976 --> 00:12:36.980
Couldn't you have at
least given us a sign

00:12:37.013 --> 00:12:38.817
that you were still out there?

00:12:41.857 --> 00:12:44.796
He must've had a good
reason not to tell us.

00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:46.332
Right, Master?

00:12:46.365 --> 00:12:47.935
It's because...

00:13:00.493 --> 00:13:03.734
My friends, I'll explain
everything in due time.

00:13:03.767 --> 00:13:05.136
But before I do...

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:07.240
Avan: I want to see all of
you run to the central palace

00:13:07.273 --> 00:13:09.513
as fast as you can
- understood?

00:13:09.546 --> 00:13:11.315
Let's call it a race.

00:13:11.348 --> 00:13:12.217
Huh?!

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.085
[confused chirp]

00:13:15.658 --> 00:13:17.327
No, not understood.
Are you kidding?

00:13:17.361 --> 00:13:19.431
Why do we have to race
at a time like this?!

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:20.768
If you had a good reason,

00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:21.903
just answer
the question and...

00:13:21.936 --> 00:13:24.943
Let it go, Popp!

00:13:24.976 --> 00:13:27.781
The only thing that I have
to say right now is this:

00:13:27.815 --> 00:13:30.052
I'm here for the same
reason as all of you,

00:13:30.086 --> 00:13:31.790
and that's to defeat
the Dark King.

00:13:31.823 --> 00:13:33.126
Until we do that,

00:13:33.159 --> 00:13:35.230
I'm afraid these questions
are going to have to wait.

00:13:35.263 --> 00:13:37.267
Please, trust me.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.641
I'm no longer your master,
but I promise I'm your ally.

00:13:40.675 --> 00:13:42.010
So let us fight together.

00:13:42.043 --> 00:13:44.147
And finish this,
once and for all.

00:14:02.818 --> 00:14:04.188
Do we have to run?

00:14:04.221 --> 00:14:07.594
I really don't have the
stamina to do this right now...

00:14:16.044 --> 00:14:18.550
Avan [thought]: That's the
spirit. Thank you, everyone.

00:14:23.793 --> 00:14:25.163
Well, look at you.

00:14:25.196 --> 00:14:27.000
On your feet already I see.

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:28.169
Killvearn: [devious chuckle]

00:14:28.202 --> 00:14:31.643
Yes. One of the many
perks of immortality.

00:14:31.677 --> 00:14:32.945
You surprised, Hero?

00:14:32.978 --> 00:14:34.949
Killvearn: Hadlar's little
stunt may have stung,

00:14:34.983 --> 00:14:37.654
but it will take a lot
more to get rid of me.

00:14:37.688 --> 00:14:38.991
The "Dark Lord"
may have used

00:14:39.024 --> 00:14:40.694
his final moments
to slow me down...

00:14:40.727 --> 00:14:42.598
but now that he's
out of the way,

00:14:42.632 --> 00:14:44.635
I won't be stopped again.

00:14:46.204 --> 00:14:48.242
Killvearn: No
resurrections this time.

00:14:48.275 --> 00:14:49.779
My instincts
are telling me that

00:14:49.813 --> 00:14:51.850
I can't afford to
grant you any mercy.

00:14:51.883 --> 00:14:53.653
It's simply too risky.

00:14:56.124 --> 00:14:57.795
Go right ahead...

00:14:57.828 --> 00:14:59.464
if you really think you can.

00:15:06.779 --> 00:15:07.515
I don't get it.

00:15:07.548 --> 00:15:08.415
Why would Master want us

00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:10.153
to race to the
palace without him?

00:15:10.186 --> 00:15:11.221
It doesn't make sense.

00:15:11.255 --> 00:15:13.192
So? When did he
ever make sense?

00:15:13.225 --> 00:15:14.461
He's never been wrong before,

00:15:14.494 --> 00:15:17.000
so if he says we should run,
then we get running.

00:15:17.033 --> 00:15:18.202
It might seem meaningless...

00:15:18.235 --> 00:15:19.605
or even downright stupid...

00:15:19.639 --> 00:15:22.377
but there's a method to
his madness every time.

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:24.848
That's just
Master Avan's style.

00:15:24.882 --> 00:15:27.554
It always works out,
wait and see.

00:15:27.588 --> 00:15:30.093
Killvearn: I wouldn't be
so confident if I were you.

00:15:30.126 --> 00:15:32.463
Unlike me,
you're quite mortal.

00:15:32.497 --> 00:15:35.236
You obviously sent the others
away to keep them from danger,

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:37.273
but now you'll have
to face me alone.

00:15:37.307 --> 00:15:39.946
Perhaps you think that
I won't be a match for you,

00:15:39.979 --> 00:15:41.081
but I guarantee...

00:15:41.114 --> 00:15:44.354
Your arrogance
will cost you dearly.

00:15:46.425 --> 00:15:48.831
Killvearn: I'll admit that
thwarting my Nine of Diamonds

00:15:48.864 --> 00:15:50.734
was an impressive feat.

00:15:50.767 --> 00:15:53.472
However, I have many more
traps throughout the palace.

00:15:53.507 --> 00:15:55.377
The others are bound
to fall into one

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:58.449
long before they reach
the inner sanctum.

00:15:58.482 --> 00:16:00.053
And as for you...

00:16:00.086 --> 00:16:02.958
no matter how powerful
your magic may be,

00:16:02.992 --> 00:16:05.730
I'm not giving you
another chance to use it.

00:16:05.764 --> 00:16:08.737
I'll accept your
"invitation", Hero.

00:16:08.771 --> 00:16:10.306
Well, Mr. Reaper...

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.744
or whatever it
is they call you...

00:16:12.778 --> 00:16:15.116
Before you do,
answer me this:

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:17.220
When someone is caught
in one of your traps,

00:16:17.254 --> 00:16:19.726
will it activate
automatically?

00:16:19.759 --> 00:16:22.364
Because unless I'm mistaken,

00:16:22.397 --> 00:16:24.769
snares of this kind
need to be activated

00:16:24.802 --> 00:16:26.940
by their creator's
magic power.

00:16:26.973 --> 00:16:28.342
And it seems to me...

00:16:28.375 --> 00:16:30.714
that your hands are
rather full at the moment.

00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:33.052
Killvearn: Y-You...

00:16:33.085 --> 00:16:35.825
This was your plan
all along, wasn't it?

00:16:35.858 --> 00:16:37.160
By keeping me occupied,

00:16:37.193 --> 00:16:40.166
even if your pathetic
Disciples wander into my traps,

00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:42.070
I won't be able
to activate them.

00:16:42.104 --> 00:16:46.211
And that's why you
sent them on ahead.

00:16:46.245 --> 00:16:49.017
Killvearn: Well, well.
Aren't you a clever one.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.055
You're more dangerous
than I thought,

00:16:51.088 --> 00:16:52.457
but it makes no difference.

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:55.230
Enough chit-chat.
You're going to the afterlife.

00:16:55.263 --> 00:16:57.367
Once I can give the
others my full attention,

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.937
I'll make quick work of them.

00:16:58.971 --> 00:17:01.709
They're hopeless without
their fearless leader.

00:17:01.743 --> 00:17:05.082
Most of my remaining traps
are inside the palace, anyway.

00:17:05.115 --> 00:17:07.387
They'll walk right into them.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.794
Oh? Well, thanks for
the tip. Quite useful.

00:17:10.827 --> 00:17:14.100
I'll certainly keep that
in mind for down the road.

00:17:14.134 --> 00:17:15.770
Killvearn: That's enough!

00:17:17.875 --> 00:17:20.112
W-What? No, no...

00:17:20.146 --> 00:17:21.749
Why can't you move?

00:17:23.485 --> 00:17:26.158
Appreciate the offer,
but I don't need a shave.

00:17:26.192 --> 00:17:28.061
I already had one
before I came here,

00:17:28.095 --> 00:17:30.065
and your hands seem shaky.

00:17:30.099 --> 00:17:31.836
Killvearn: H-How
are you doing this?

00:17:31.869 --> 00:17:36.077
I can't move my arm - no,
I can't move half my body!

00:17:37.079 --> 00:17:39.017
W-Where did this
feather come from?

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:40.420
I didn't even feel it!

00:17:40.453 --> 00:17:42.524
Avan: Your arrogance
will be your demise.

00:17:42.558 --> 00:17:46.064
I could sense your malice was
still present after you fell.

00:17:46.098 --> 00:17:47.500
I took precautions.

00:17:51.942 --> 00:17:53.178
Now, tell me...

00:17:53.211 --> 00:17:56.318
How does it feel to be
caught in a trap yourself?

00:17:59.023 --> 00:18:00.493
Avan: When I first met Hadlar,

00:18:00.528 --> 00:18:03.365
he was a cruel man,
not unlike you...

00:18:03.398 --> 00:18:06.038
He delighted in doing
terrible things to people.

00:18:06.071 --> 00:18:08.342
But he always did
those things himself.

00:18:08.375 --> 00:18:11.081
He was never a coward.

00:18:11.114 --> 00:18:13.720
Avan: And in battle,
he always fought fair.

00:18:13.754 --> 00:18:16.859
He wouldn't lower
himself to craven tactics.

00:18:16.893 --> 00:18:18.262
But you...

00:18:18.295 --> 00:18:20.332
You're the lowest
I've ever faced...

00:18:20.366 --> 00:18:23.205
Like a snake slithering
around the battlefield.

00:18:23.238 --> 00:18:25.242
All you do is
sit back and watch

00:18:25.276 --> 00:18:28.115
while your traps
do all the work.

00:18:28.148 --> 00:18:31.021
You're worse than cruel,
you're barbaric.

00:18:31.054 --> 00:18:33.559
[trembling]

00:18:33.593 --> 00:18:36.131
Avan: A true warrior
takes pride...

00:18:36.164 --> 00:18:39.505
in honoring...
the basic rules of combat.

00:18:39.538 --> 00:18:42.077
At least Hadlar
understood that much.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:43.613
So with this blow,

00:18:43.647 --> 00:18:48.523
I hope you'll feel the anger of
his departed soul, you fiend!

00:18:55.002 --> 00:18:56.572
[shrieking]

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.251
Remember this, Killvearn.

00:19:03.285 --> 00:19:06.324
Although I take no pleasure
in using such methods...

00:19:06.358 --> 00:19:08.229
I'm also well versed
in the spell-craft

00:19:08.262 --> 00:19:09.865
you're hiding behind.

00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:13.640
If you insist on using such
shameful tactics against us,

00:19:13.673 --> 00:19:16.111
I'll be forced to
fight back in kind...

00:19:16.144 --> 00:19:18.916
And let me be clear;
I will be unforgiving.

00:19:29.639 --> 00:19:31.008
Killvearn: So be it.

00:19:31.041 --> 00:19:33.880
But you would be
wise to remember this.

00:19:36.519 --> 00:19:38.857
Killvearn: I'm going
to finish you off...

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:41.194
like Hadlar never could.

00:19:41.227 --> 00:19:42.631
I swear it...

00:19:42.664 --> 00:19:46.171
I'm going to choke the life
out of you with my own hands.

00:19:46.205 --> 00:19:48.442
Mark my words, Hero.

00:20:00.333 --> 00:20:01.969
I was hoping he'd do that.

00:20:02.738 --> 00:20:03.873
Now, then...

00:20:19.772 --> 00:20:20.974
Here we go.

00:20:21.008 --> 00:20:23.245
So King Vearn's
in there, huh?

00:20:23.278 --> 00:20:25.216
We're never gonna find him.

00:20:25.249 --> 00:20:26.552
I mean, it's enormous.

00:20:26.586 --> 00:20:29.258
And it's even more
terrifying up close.

00:20:29.291 --> 00:20:30.527
Well, you're not wrong.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.496
Avan: Intimidating, isn't it?

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:34.835
[surprised breaths]

00:20:37.473 --> 00:20:37.941
Wh...

00:20:37.975 --> 00:20:39.010
Master...

00:20:39.044 --> 00:20:40.714
How did you get
up here so fast?

00:20:40.747 --> 00:20:43.586
No kidding. We were easily
a few minutes ahead of you.

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:44.922
[laughing]

00:20:44.956 --> 00:20:45.924
What do you mean...

00:20:45.957 --> 00:20:47.026
You didn't notice?

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.565
I was only a few steps
behind you the whole way up.

00:20:49.599 --> 00:20:51.803
Hyunckel [thought]:
No... He's lying.

00:20:51.836 --> 00:20:56.011
If he were so close to us, I
would've sensed his presence.

00:20:56.044 --> 00:20:58.081
He stayed behind... But why?

00:20:58.114 --> 00:20:59.818
What could he
be hiding from us?

00:20:59.852 --> 00:21:00.720
Excellent.

00:21:00.754 --> 00:21:03.058
I used a new skill
I call "Sneaky-Step,

00:21:03.092 --> 00:21:04.494
Stealthy-Step, Avan-Step."

00:21:04.528 --> 00:21:06.398
It must work even
better than I thought.

00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:07.835
That's what you're calling it?

00:21:07.868 --> 00:21:08.903
Why not call it...

00:21:08.936 --> 00:21:11.843
"Sneaky-Step, Stealthy-Step,
Popp-Step" instead?

00:21:11.876 --> 00:21:12.811
Well, I suppose...

00:21:12.844 --> 00:21:14.448
if you were the one
who used it, then yes.

00:21:14.481 --> 00:21:15.717
You could call it that.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:17.119
Hyunckel [thought]:
There's something about him

00:21:17.153 --> 00:21:19.157
that's different
than I remember.

00:21:19.191 --> 00:21:20.425
It's almost as if...

00:21:20.459 --> 00:21:22.964
his powers have
totally changed.

00:21:27.407 --> 00:21:29.477
Hyunckel [thought]:
That golden glow...

00:21:30.714 --> 00:21:32.116
Hyunckel [thought]:
I get it.

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:34.487
His power... that's
what feels off...

00:21:34.521 --> 00:21:35.858
This man... He...

00:21:35.891 --> 00:21:37.159
Moving on, everyone...

00:21:37.193 --> 00:21:38.261
For your next task -

00:21:38.295 --> 00:21:40.098
Hyunckel: Hold
it just one second.

00:21:44.474 --> 00:21:46.444
I can see the extent
of your power,

00:21:46.478 --> 00:21:48.081
and it doesn't sit right.

00:21:48.114 --> 00:21:49.484
But, Hyunckel...

00:21:49.518 --> 00:21:52.725
What do you mean by
"the extent... of my power"?

00:21:52.758 --> 00:21:56.064
I mean that you're weak.
Far too weak.

00:23:36.666 --> 00:23:38.636
Narrator: While Hyunckel
stews in his suspicion,

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:40.339
Avan leads the rest
of his Disciples

00:23:40.372 --> 00:23:42.811
into King Vearn's
sprawling palace.

00:23:42.845 --> 00:23:44.849
Soon they discover
their path is barred

00:23:44.882 --> 00:23:46.753
by a gate even
stronger than the one

00:23:46.786 --> 00:23:48.757
Dai and Baran
struggled to breach...

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:51.929
Yet Avan insists
on tackling it alone.

00:23:51.962 --> 00:23:52.798
Along the way,

00:23:52.831 --> 00:23:54.300
the mystery of
his journey since

00:23:54.333 --> 00:23:57.340
that fateful day on Dermline
Island will be revealed...

00:23:57.373 --> 00:23:58.843
Don't miss it - next time on

00:23:58.876 --> 00:24:00.780
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:00.814 --> 00:24:03.218
"The Secret Way
of Purification.
