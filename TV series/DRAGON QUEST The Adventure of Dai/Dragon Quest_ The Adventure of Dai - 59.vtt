WEBVTT

00:01:55.665 --> 00:01:59.974
[terrified chatter]

00:02:00.007 --> 00:02:02.077
[screaming]

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.846
Everybody run!

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:04.448
Hurry! Take cover!

00:02:17.074 --> 00:02:18.911
Aide: That was Poltos!

00:02:20.915 --> 00:02:22.417
[alarmed grunts]

00:02:23.688 --> 00:02:25.558
Fobster: Forgive my intrusion,
but there's no time to waste.

00:02:26.092 --> 00:02:27.228
My liege;

00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:28.598
News from Carl Kingdom.

00:02:28.631 --> 00:02:30.768
It was Queen Flora
who sent me here.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.281
Deroline: [shivering]

00:02:37.314 --> 00:02:40.020
Couldn't... you pick
somewhere warmer to hide?!

00:02:40.054 --> 00:02:41.489
It's safe out here!

00:02:41.524 --> 00:02:43.227
This is the only
place that's safe...

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.796
Away from the Dark Army.

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.032
I'm starving...

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:47.669
Heroh Heroh: Hey!

00:02:47.702 --> 00:02:50.473
You hungry? We caught
us some dinner.

00:02:55.183 --> 00:02:57.254
Zulbon: What is that?!

00:02:57.287 --> 00:02:59.458
Uh... a bird?

00:03:01.162 --> 00:03:04.101
[terrified screaming]

00:03:04.134 --> 00:03:06.272
All: Run for it!

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.417
[screaming]

00:03:12.451 --> 00:03:15.825
Where's the real Hero -
when you need him most?!

00:03:15.858 --> 00:03:17.762
[screaming]

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:23.139
Zaboera: [delighted cackle]

00:03:23.173 --> 00:03:26.046
What incredible
destructive ability.

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.984
King Vearn is great indeed.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.391
Ah, if it isn't my master,

00:03:32.425 --> 00:03:35.865
the great spectral
Commander Mystvearn.

00:03:35.898 --> 00:03:39.506
Did you see the size
of that crater out there?

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.579
I must admit, even
I am still amazed at

00:03:42.613 --> 00:03:45.885
the extent of our
king's vast power...

00:03:45.918 --> 00:03:49.058
Oh, did I mention that
he also promoted me to be

00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:51.563
the Dark Army's
Second-in-Command?

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:54.068
I'm so glad I
had the foresight to

00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:56.973
cut ties with
that fool Hadlar.

00:03:57.943 --> 00:03:59.178
Mystvearn: Zaboera.

00:03:59.211 --> 00:04:00.481
Y-yes?

00:04:00.515 --> 00:04:02.251
Mystvearn: During
Hadlar's transformation

00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:04.155
into the Superior Being,

00:04:04.188 --> 00:04:05.758
did you not notice
the Black Core

00:04:05.792 --> 00:04:07.929
that had been
planted inside him?

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:11.703
Well, of course I
noticed. Who wouldn't?

00:04:11.737 --> 00:04:14.374
I just thought it was
best to leave it alone.

00:04:14.408 --> 00:04:17.882
I knew that King Vearn
would set if off eventually,

00:04:17.915 --> 00:04:20.588
but so long as I wasn't
caught in the blast,

00:04:20.622 --> 00:04:23.293
it could work
to my advantage.

00:04:23.326 --> 00:04:25.564
[devious giggle]

00:04:28.937 --> 00:04:30.306
Something wrong?

00:04:30.942 --> 00:04:32.310
Mystvearn: You're scum.

00:04:32.344 --> 00:04:35.851
Speaking ill of Hadlar
is beyond your station!

00:04:37.855 --> 00:04:41.563
Mystvearn: I recognize
your part in saving King Vearn,

00:04:41.597 --> 00:04:44.769
but I have no trust
in some gutter rat

00:04:44.802 --> 00:04:48.076
with eyes only for
his own success.

00:04:48.109 --> 00:04:50.413
Your type always
turn on their masters

00:04:50.447 --> 00:04:53.720
when it suits their needs.

00:04:53.754 --> 00:04:57.528
Mystvearn: And when you do...
I will not hesitate.

00:05:02.572 --> 00:05:04.610
You can threaten
me all you wish.

00:05:04.643 --> 00:05:07.815
Dominance is not a
matter of power alone;

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.620
one must have
patience and cunning

00:05:09.653 --> 00:05:11.756
to be the last one standing.

00:05:13.293 --> 00:05:16.299
And I happen to have
those qualities in spades,

00:05:16.332 --> 00:05:18.971
so it will be me who
gets the last laugh.

00:05:37.208 --> 00:05:39.646
Popp [thought]:
I... I made it.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.816
But how did I end up here?

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.194
Popp [thought]:
You swam all this way

00:05:47.227 --> 00:05:49.498
carrying me, didn't you?

00:05:49.532 --> 00:05:52.104
You never cease to amaze, Maam.

00:05:52.137 --> 00:05:54.241
Ursa Major: [growling]

00:05:54.274 --> 00:05:55.744
[alarmed grunt]

00:05:59.352 --> 00:06:01.188
[growling]

00:06:01.222 --> 00:06:03.694
Popp [thought]:
An Ursa Major?!

00:06:03.727 --> 00:06:06.432
Without my Magic Power,
I'm no match.

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.574
But I have to protect
her at all costs!

00:06:13.914 --> 00:06:15.685
Hey, come and get it!

00:06:15.718 --> 00:06:18.523
I'll turn you into
a rug - you hear me?!

00:06:20.427 --> 00:06:22.464
[threatening snarl]

00:06:26.606 --> 00:06:27.775
Popp [thought]:
What's it doing?!

00:06:27.808 --> 00:06:30.581
Chiu: Ha! Good job,
Trooper Number Eight!

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.319
Greetings, Sir Popp.

00:06:33.352 --> 00:06:34.990
And Miss Maam!

00:06:35.023 --> 00:06:36.125
[relieved sigh]

00:06:36.158 --> 00:06:37.227
You idiots!

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.599
Almost gave me a heart-attack.

00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:40.902
Akhim: Hang in there, sir.

00:06:40.935 --> 00:06:43.105
We'll take you back
to the Forest Fort!

00:06:43.774 --> 00:06:45.511
Good job, pal.

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:48.817
The Forest Fort, huh?

00:06:48.851 --> 00:06:51.155
Nova: It's the basecamp
for the Order of Carl.

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:52.324
They're back in the fight.

00:06:52.357 --> 00:06:54.630
Queen Flora and some
of her forces survived.

00:06:54.663 --> 00:06:56.332
Some kinda miracle, huh?

00:06:56.365 --> 00:06:57.902
[relieved sigh]

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.477
Popp: So, it's been
four whole days?

00:07:02.512 --> 00:07:03.981
Leona: And in that time...

00:07:04.015 --> 00:07:06.119
The Dark Army has been
using their flying fortress

00:07:06.152 --> 00:07:09.425
to bombard towns and
cities all over the world.

00:07:09.458 --> 00:07:11.462
One target every day.

00:07:11.496 --> 00:07:13.534
You know, I did
think it was odd

00:07:13.567 --> 00:07:15.805
that they weren't
attacking the capitals,

00:07:15.838 --> 00:07:18.678
but if their goal is sheer
destruction, it makes sense.

00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:20.179
It doesn't matter now.

00:07:20.213 --> 00:07:23.486
If King Vearn wants to
wipe out the Surface World,

00:07:23.521 --> 00:07:27.127
I'd rather have to deal
with an invasion, honestly.

00:07:28.897 --> 00:07:31.936
But at least the two of you
made it back in one piece!

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:35.476
And I'm sure Dai and the
others will be here soon...

00:07:35.511 --> 00:07:38.316
I sure hope you're right.

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:40.654
Things weren't
looking so good...

00:07:40.688 --> 00:07:44.261
I mean, the Holy Mother Dragon
flew in and took Dai away.

00:07:44.295 --> 00:07:47.434
And then Hyunckel and
Crocodine took a direct hit

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:49.472
from the Dark King's magic.

00:07:49.506 --> 00:07:51.543
If Hadlar hadn't
shown up when he did,

00:07:51.576 --> 00:07:53.747
it would have been
the end of us.

00:07:54.549 --> 00:07:58.824
We got our butts
kicked. Seriously.

00:07:58.857 --> 00:08:00.695
Leona [thought]: It's no use.

00:08:00.728 --> 00:08:02.097
Popp and Maam have both felt

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:06.138
the terrifying force of
the Dark King - firsthand.

00:08:06.171 --> 00:08:09.078
There... there isn't
anything we could say

00:08:09.111 --> 00:08:10.714
to lift their spirits.

00:08:11.281 --> 00:08:12.718
Popp: I guess...

00:08:12.752 --> 00:08:16.125
There's just nothing at all we
can do to stop them, is there?

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.066
Flora: You mustn't
say such gloomy things.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.101
[surprised breaths]

00:08:24.475 --> 00:08:25.912
Flora: After all...

00:08:25.945 --> 00:08:28.917
You are Avan's
disciples. Aren't you?

00:08:29.953 --> 00:08:30.955
Huh?

00:08:30.988 --> 00:08:32.391
Ah, Queen Flora!

00:08:32.424 --> 00:08:34.261
Oh! The leader of Carl!

00:08:34.294 --> 00:08:35.296
That's right.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.067
She escaped the
fall of her kingdom

00:08:37.101 --> 00:08:38.704
with a handful of knights.

00:08:38.737 --> 00:08:40.508
They want to join
forces with us

00:08:40.541 --> 00:08:42.310
and strike back
at the Dark Army.

00:08:44.381 --> 00:08:48.156
Leona: We've all been holed up
here planning our next move.

00:08:48.189 --> 00:08:50.460
Now, Popp... Maam.

00:08:50.494 --> 00:08:52.364
I know you're distraught.

00:08:52.397 --> 00:08:54.267
But you must take heart.

00:08:54.301 --> 00:08:57.441
If you really wish to carry
on the will of Sir Avan,

00:08:57.474 --> 00:09:00.279
then you cannot give
in to such weakness.

00:09:01.616 --> 00:09:03.987
Popp: Whoa, you
knew Master Avan?

00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:07.294
As a matter of fact, he
once belonged to our Order.

00:09:07.328 --> 00:09:08.731
Avan fought bravely

00:09:08.764 --> 00:09:13.640
to defend our kingdom along
with my lead knight, Sir Roka.

00:09:15.578 --> 00:09:19.017
Yes, Maam. I knew
your father, as well.

00:09:24.128 --> 00:09:25.330
Back then...

00:09:25.363 --> 00:09:30.473
Lord Hadlar led the Dark Army,
laying siege to our domain.

00:09:30.508 --> 00:09:33.112
My father had grown ill...

00:09:33.146 --> 00:09:34.347
So the throne fell to me.

00:09:34.381 --> 00:09:38.322
I led our kingdom's fight
against the growing darkness.

00:09:38.657 --> 00:09:40.026
[cheering]

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.698
Flora: I tried my best
to put on a brave face

00:09:42.732 --> 00:09:45.538
and boost the morale
of my subjects,

00:09:45.571 --> 00:09:47.609
but I wasn't sure we
could actually overcome

00:09:47.642 --> 00:09:50.948
the supernatural powers
of the Dark Lord.

00:09:50.982 --> 00:09:54.790
But really...
I was terrified.

00:09:54.823 --> 00:09:56.458
And it wasn't just me.

00:09:56.491 --> 00:09:58.531
Everyone in the
palace was afraid.

00:09:58.564 --> 00:09:59.732
Knight: It's useless.

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:02.304
There's no way we can
outmatch the Dark Lord!

00:10:02.337 --> 00:10:05.143
Minister: If we just keep
scampering around like this,

00:10:05.177 --> 00:10:06.913
we'll gain nothing.

00:10:06.947 --> 00:10:09.184
Flora: But Avan
refused to give up.

00:10:09.217 --> 00:10:10.721
Avan: No, no, no.

00:10:10.755 --> 00:10:13.158
It's time to pull
yourselves together, men!

00:10:13.192 --> 00:10:17.034
If we do nothing, then we
really will gain nothing here.

00:10:17.067 --> 00:10:21.075
The way I see it, if all we
can do is "scamper" around...

00:10:21.108 --> 00:10:22.243
Then my friends...

00:10:22.277 --> 00:10:24.014
"Scamper", we shall!

00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:44.388
[laughing]

00:10:44.421 --> 00:10:45.824
Flora: I just
couldn't help it.

00:10:45.858 --> 00:10:50.433
I burst out laughing. Right
there in front of everyone.

00:10:50.467 --> 00:10:51.937
That's when I realized...

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:57.915
this man is a natural-born
Hero. He can inspire anyone.

00:10:59.118 --> 00:11:03.794
And so nowadays, whenever I
feel like I've lost hope...

00:11:03.827 --> 00:11:06.900
I remember I can still
"scamper around."

00:11:06.933 --> 00:11:08.570
And I hear his voice...

00:11:08.604 --> 00:11:10.707
Telling me not to give up.

00:11:13.479 --> 00:11:16.184
Popp: Um... Your Majesty...

00:11:19.592 --> 00:11:21.095
Master Avan...

00:11:21.128 --> 00:11:24.234
It's all right, Popp.
I know he's gone.

00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:27.575
Flora: If he were still
out there somewhere,

00:11:27.608 --> 00:11:30.514
he would never have
let things go this far.

00:11:30.548 --> 00:11:32.183
The destruction
of his own home.

00:11:32.216 --> 00:11:36.391
I'm certain, that if he were
able, he'd be by my side.

00:11:37.728 --> 00:11:40.901
Popp [thought]: Oh.
I get it. So, she...

00:11:40.935 --> 00:11:45.944
Maam [thought]: She was in love
with Master Avan, wasn't she?

00:11:56.566 --> 00:11:58.235
"Scamper," huh?

00:11:58.269 --> 00:12:00.541
Sounds like a plan.

00:12:00.574 --> 00:12:02.077
Yeah, count me in.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:03.045
[chuckling]

00:12:03.078 --> 00:12:05.984
I may never be quite
as brave Master Avan,

00:12:06.018 --> 00:12:09.157
but I know I can scamper
with the best of 'em!

00:12:11.261 --> 00:12:12.464
Many thanks...

00:12:12.497 --> 00:12:15.469
But for now you must rest
- the time will come.

00:12:17.808 --> 00:12:19.645
Get yourselves in
fighting shape.

00:12:19.679 --> 00:12:23.520
I have a plan of
my own. You'll see.

00:12:26.593 --> 00:12:27.895
She's a great woman.

00:12:27.929 --> 00:12:29.933
It's almost as if
her mere presence...

00:12:29.966 --> 00:12:32.070
leaves a charge in the air.

00:12:32.103 --> 00:12:33.272
No kidding.

00:12:33.306 --> 00:12:36.847
I can definitely see why you
respect her so much, Leona.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.019
Popp: So she and
Master Avan were a thing.

00:12:40.053 --> 00:12:43.159
I mean, she does have
that mature appeal...

00:12:43.192 --> 00:12:45.196
[giggle]

00:12:45.229 --> 00:12:46.465
Both: Scumbag!

00:12:46.498 --> 00:12:47.301
[pained groan]

00:12:47.334 --> 00:12:48.436
Bowson: Princess Leona!

00:12:48.469 --> 00:12:49.639
Your presence is needed.

00:12:49.672 --> 00:12:52.477
The Dark Army is moving
against Ringaia!

00:12:52.511 --> 00:12:53.546
[worried breaths]

00:13:12.551 --> 00:13:16.459
Vearn: I forgot how boring it
can be when all our affairs

00:13:16.492 --> 00:13:18.129
are running smoothly.

00:13:18.162 --> 00:13:20.132
Zaboera: I wholeheartedly agree.

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:22.871
Killvearn: I wouldn't
be so sure.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.418
This card represents
misfortune...

00:13:29.451 --> 00:13:32.624
And it comes up no matter
how many times I shuffle.

00:13:32.658 --> 00:13:34.294
Perhaps it foretells
of yet another

00:13:34.327 --> 00:13:37.367
resistance looming
upon our horizon.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.435
Killvearn: Perhaps...

00:13:38.469 --> 00:13:42.110
But whatever it means,
it's definitely trouble.

00:13:42.144 --> 00:13:45.784
My cards have never been
wrong before, Your Majesty.

00:13:45.818 --> 00:13:48.088
Then let us draw them out.

00:13:48.122 --> 00:13:52.363
We can make some use of those
two we've been holding captive.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.873
Canal: Your Majesty!
Outside! Look in the sky!

00:13:58.075 --> 00:13:59.980
King Teran:
The Holy Mother Dragon.

00:14:00.013 --> 00:14:01.281
This can only mean that

00:14:01.315 --> 00:14:05.123
the life of a Dragon Knight
is coming to an end...

00:14:05.156 --> 00:14:07.127
and the God of
Dragons has chosen

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.599
our people to be witnesses.

00:14:09.632 --> 00:14:11.201
Canal: Could it be the Hero?!

00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:36.384
Dai: Where am I?

00:14:38.155 --> 00:14:41.863
What... What happened to me?

00:14:41.897 --> 00:14:42.865
Holy Dragon: Death.

00:14:42.898 --> 00:14:43.900
[startled breath]

00:14:43.934 --> 00:14:45.336
Holy Dragon:
The end of your path.

00:14:47.508 --> 00:14:48.777
And who are you?

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:51.449
Holy Dragon: I am
the Holy Mother Dragon,

00:14:51.482 --> 00:14:53.018
a servant of the gods.

00:14:53.051 --> 00:14:56.893
I preside over the eternal
cycle of the Dragon Knights.

00:14:56.926 --> 00:14:58.496
The Mother Dragon?

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.299
That's right...

00:15:00.333 --> 00:15:03.406
You're the being who passes
on the Crest's power...

00:15:03.439 --> 00:15:06.813
from one Dragon Knight
to whichever one is next.

00:15:06.846 --> 00:15:09.685
I still kinda feel
like I'm alive, though.

00:15:09.718 --> 00:15:11.221
Holy Dragon:
Allow me to explain.

00:15:11.255 --> 00:15:15.363
You have taken on an astral
form and are between realms.

00:15:15.396 --> 00:15:20.206
Soon your spirit shall pass
on into the world of the gods.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.914
I see. So will another...

00:15:23.947 --> 00:15:25.751
Dragon Knight replace me, or...

00:15:25.784 --> 00:15:30.493
Holy Dragon: No. There will
be no more Dragon Knights.

00:15:31.796 --> 00:15:34.101
Holy Dragon: You
are the last, Dai.

00:15:34.134 --> 00:15:37.039
Wait! But... But, why?!

00:15:37.073 --> 00:15:38.610
Holy Dragon:
The gods who designed

00:15:38.643 --> 00:15:40.246
the realm you call home

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.383
created the Dragon
Knights in order to

00:15:42.417 --> 00:15:45.189
prevent the forces
of evil from tipping

00:15:45.223 --> 00:15:47.493
the natural
balance of the world.

00:15:48.362 --> 00:15:51.001
But it seems that
over many eons,

00:15:51.035 --> 00:15:54.509
the power of such evil
has managed to evolve.

00:15:54.542 --> 00:15:57.515
Now the Dark King Vearn
possesses a power

00:15:57.548 --> 00:16:02.424
that could rival the
very gods themselves.

00:16:02.457 --> 00:16:05.196
Holy Dragon: Even with
the might of a Dragon Knight,

00:16:05.229 --> 00:16:07.568
evil can no longer be thwarted.

00:16:07.601 --> 00:16:10.674
In fact, the desire
to overcome your kind

00:16:10.707 --> 00:16:15.383
may be what drove evil to
evolve in the first place.

00:16:15.416 --> 00:16:16.819
Do you understand?

00:16:16.852 --> 00:16:18.121
B-But... I...

00:16:18.155 --> 00:16:20.727
Holy Dragon: That is why
I must bring the history of

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:23.567
the Dragon Knights to an end.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.508
I no longer have the power to
create a new Knight, anyway.

00:16:27.541 --> 00:16:31.583
The growing darkness
has covered the world,

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:35.256
weakening me as well.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:40.567
You mean... you're really just
going to let the Dark King win?

00:16:44.508 --> 00:16:46.613
Holy Dragon: The trials
of the mortal world

00:16:46.646 --> 00:16:48.684
no longer concern you.

00:16:48.717 --> 00:16:54.360
Let them go, and I shall return
your spirit to the heavens.

00:17:00.841 --> 00:17:02.343
Holy Dragon:
Something is wrong...

00:17:02.376 --> 00:17:05.215
You have two souls within you.

00:17:15.905 --> 00:17:17.574
Dai: Dad?!

00:17:17.608 --> 00:17:19.579
Holy Mother Dragon,

00:17:19.612 --> 00:17:22.451
the boy is not your
last true Knight...

00:17:22.484 --> 00:17:23.520
I am.

00:17:23.553 --> 00:17:27.394
Dai is my son, and his
mother Soala was a human.

00:17:27.427 --> 00:17:30.901
If you must take a soul,
then take mine.

00:17:30.934 --> 00:17:33.439
Holy Dragon: A child?!
That cannot be.

00:17:33.473 --> 00:17:36.646
He still has many
years ahead of him.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.181
So please, I beseech you.

00:17:38.215 --> 00:17:40.821
Will you grant
him another chance?

00:17:40.854 --> 00:17:42.223
Whoa, wait...

00:17:42.257 --> 00:17:44.327
Holy Dragon: Even if
I do revive him,

00:17:44.361 --> 00:17:47.467
he will only face
another cruel loss.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.572
No one can defeat
the Dark King,

00:17:49.605 --> 00:17:52.276
no matter what power
they might possess.

00:17:52.309 --> 00:17:54.849
I do not think
that is the case.

00:17:54.882 --> 00:17:56.452
My son has a strength

00:17:56.485 --> 00:17:59.258
no ordinary Dragon
Knight possesses.

00:17:59.291 --> 00:18:01.829
Something beyond power.

00:18:01.863 --> 00:18:03.298
Holy Dragon: But...

00:18:03.332 --> 00:18:07.473
If every generation is meant to
receive only one Dragon Knight,

00:18:07.508 --> 00:18:11.515
then tell me - how was
I able to sire a child?

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:14.354
So now, I believe that
the gods have realized

00:18:14.388 --> 00:18:18.195
our limitations and decided
to give us a new hope.

00:18:18.228 --> 00:18:22.236
Power may rule over everything
in this world, but...

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:25.109
hope is the
greatest power of all.

00:18:25.143 --> 00:18:27.280
And perhaps that is
the reason why

00:18:27.313 --> 00:18:29.818
this boy was
allowed to be born.

00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:34.695
Please, Mother. Revive him.

00:18:38.837 --> 00:18:39.772
Holy Dragon: Very well.

00:18:39.805 --> 00:18:42.878
I shall grant Dai what
remains of my power,

00:18:42.911 --> 00:18:46.217
giving him one, final chance.

00:18:49.257 --> 00:18:51.161
Baran: Dai...

00:18:51.194 --> 00:18:52.564
From here on out,

00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:56.171
the history of the Dragon
Knights will be yours to write.

00:18:56.204 --> 00:18:58.843
One day you may
even be a father.

00:18:58.876 --> 00:19:02.851
But first of all, you
must defeat King Vearn...

00:19:02.885 --> 00:19:04.889
And I know you will.

00:19:04.922 --> 00:19:06.358
But I just can't.

00:19:06.391 --> 00:19:10.934
I'm not... I'm nowhere
near as strong as you are!

00:19:10.968 --> 00:19:13.941
I'll never beat
the Dark King alone!

00:19:13.974 --> 00:19:16.145
You are not alone, son.

00:19:16.178 --> 00:19:18.048
You have your friends.

00:19:18.081 --> 00:19:19.786
Dai: No, Dad-

00:19:19.819 --> 00:19:21.355
Baran: Your mother and I...

00:19:21.388 --> 00:19:23.927
will be by your side, as well.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.632
No, wait - please, don't go.

00:19:27.567 --> 00:19:30.507
Please, Dad...

00:19:50.581 --> 00:19:55.255
Please, Dad...
please don't go.

00:19:56.626 --> 00:19:57.962
Quickly now.

00:19:57.995 --> 00:19:59.598
Fetch a Mage at once!

00:19:59.632 --> 00:20:02.003
We must get him
to Queen Flora!

00:20:02.036 --> 00:20:02.938
Canal: Yes, sire!

00:20:14.194 --> 00:20:16.932
Maybe we should give
them some space?

00:20:24.147 --> 00:20:25.550
Oh, Dai.

00:20:25.584 --> 00:20:28.990
I'm so glad...
you'll be all right.

00:20:33.365 --> 00:20:35.002
Popp: Queen Flora.

00:20:35.036 --> 00:20:36.673
Dai has been fully healed.

00:20:36.706 --> 00:20:39.411
He's resting now,
but he'll pull through.

00:20:39.444 --> 00:20:42.484
I see. Well, that's a relief.

00:20:42.518 --> 00:20:44.655
Very good news indeed.

00:20:44.688 --> 00:20:49.297
Only... I'm afraid I've received
some bad news, as well.

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:51.535
The Dark Army
has sent a message

00:20:51.569 --> 00:20:54.240
to every kingdom
across the world...

00:20:54.273 --> 00:20:57.046
etched in old runes
appearing on mirrors.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.587
When translated,
here's what it says:

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.726
"To the doomed leaders
of the humans...

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.397
Your end draws near.

00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:09.839
In a few days, the forces
of our Dark Army shall rise up

00:21:09.872 --> 00:21:14.380
and wipe your pathetic
Surface World from existence.

00:21:14.414 --> 00:21:18.523
There is nothing you
can do to stop us,

00:21:18.556 --> 00:21:23.365
so make peace with your fate
and accept the inevitable.

00:21:23.399 --> 00:21:26.071
To commemorate this
grand achievement,

00:21:26.104 --> 00:21:28.042
we shall make an
example of the traitors

00:21:28.075 --> 00:21:30.012
who aided your fallen Hero:

00:21:30.046 --> 00:21:36.258
Hyunckel the Dark Swordsman and
the mighty Beast King Crocodine.

00:21:36.291 --> 00:21:38.329
We welcome all
who are interested

00:21:38.362 --> 00:21:40.900
to witness this punishment.

00:21:40.934 --> 00:21:42.672
Two days from now at noon,

00:21:42.705 --> 00:21:45.476
in the northern mountains
of Carl Kingdom,

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:48.415
they will both perish."

00:21:48.448 --> 00:21:50.520
Those no-good,
spineless cowards.

00:21:50.554 --> 00:21:52.423
There must be
something we can do.

00:21:52.457 --> 00:21:54.828
We can't let them
go through with it.

00:21:55.697 --> 00:21:58.034
We must have a
meeting at once!

00:23:37.667 --> 00:23:39.337
Narrator: With
Hyunckel and Crocodine

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:41.074
held captive
by the Dark Army,

00:23:41.107 --> 00:23:43.846
Dai awakes fully recovered
after his encounter with

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:46.519
Baran and the
Holy Mother Dragon.

00:23:46.552 --> 00:23:49.023
