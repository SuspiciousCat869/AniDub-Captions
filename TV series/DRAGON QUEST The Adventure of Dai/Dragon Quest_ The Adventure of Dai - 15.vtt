WEBVTT

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:52.157
Bye-bye, Princess.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.698
Go act tough on your
way to the afterlife!

00:02:01.644 --> 00:02:03.079
It's Dai!

00:02:03.113 --> 00:02:04.916
Get away from Leona!

00:02:06.587 --> 00:02:08.356
Come and make me!

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:15.004
If you even touch her...

00:02:15.037 --> 00:02:17.207
You're gonna regret it!

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.610
Get him, Dai!

00:02:20.948 --> 00:02:22.585
Little brat!

00:02:29.098 --> 00:02:31.837
Popp: He just jumped off
and charged in alone!

00:02:31.871 --> 00:02:35.243
Once we land, I'm going
to be right behind him.

00:02:35.276 --> 00:02:37.882
You should stay here.
Someone should keep watch.

00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:39.218
Huh?

00:02:39.251 --> 00:02:42.491
And you two, have the
Balloon Ship ready to launch!

00:02:42.525 --> 00:02:43.359
Guards: Aye!

00:02:50.374 --> 00:02:52.645
I'll regret it, huh?

00:02:53.313 --> 00:02:54.916
Rotten little kid.

00:02:58.122 --> 00:03:01.696
Just try to hurt me-
I dare you!

00:03:07.274 --> 00:03:08.710
Nice try...

00:03:17.361 --> 00:03:20.133
Flazzard [thought]:
He's fast. Could it be?

00:03:20.167 --> 00:03:22.038
I'm going to
avenge Hyunckel, too!

00:03:22.071 --> 00:03:23.507
You're gonna be sorry!

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.047
You snotty child.
Ha - you wish!

00:03:27.081 --> 00:03:28.150
Kacrackle!

00:03:28.183 --> 00:03:29.552
Dai, no!

00:03:32.926 --> 00:03:35.163
Flazzard: [menacing laugh]

00:03:35.196 --> 00:03:38.202
Freeze! Freeze!

00:03:38.236 --> 00:03:47.555
[cackling]

00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:59.445
What kind of blade is that?!

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:04.656
Magic!

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:05.825
Flazzard: What?!

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.598
Oh, wow!

00:04:08.631 --> 00:04:12.337
Take this! Fire Earth Slash!

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.640
[pained roar]

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:22.758
Damn it!

00:04:29.806 --> 00:04:31.811
Flazzard [thought]:
So, I was right.

00:04:31.844 --> 00:04:35.450
No wonder he beat
Crocodine and Hyunckel!

00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:38.657
In his battles with the
other Legion Commanders,

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.396
this little brat's combat
skills have leveled up

00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:43.233
an unbelievable amount!

00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:46.841
This might be
the time for it...

00:04:46.874 --> 00:04:50.614
Time for my trump card!

00:04:51.783 --> 00:04:55.591
Leona [thought]:
Oh, wow! Amazing, Dai!

00:04:55.625 --> 00:04:58.830
You've learned to
properly use magic.

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:01.636
What a relief.

00:05:02.071 --> 00:05:03.306
Popp: Dai!

00:05:05.143 --> 00:05:07.782
Hey, guys. We need
to help everyone!

00:05:07.815 --> 00:05:08.917
And quickly!

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.754
Maam: Hang in there!

00:05:13.093 --> 00:05:14.395
Apollo!

00:05:14.428 --> 00:05:17.234
A-Amy, go help your sister!

00:05:17.267 --> 00:05:18.570
Huh?!

00:05:20.106 --> 00:05:21.041
Amy: Marin!

00:05:22.277 --> 00:05:24.649
[amused chuckle]

00:05:24.682 --> 00:05:26.620
Popp: That bastard
did all this?!

00:05:26.653 --> 00:05:30.293
But, it looks like we've got
the upper hand, don't we?

00:05:30.327 --> 00:05:32.131
Don't let your guard down!

00:05:32.164 --> 00:05:41.616
[menacing chuckle]

00:05:42.083 --> 00:05:43.788
Oh, I get it.

00:05:43.821 --> 00:05:46.894
You're a much bigger fish
than that little princess,

00:05:46.927 --> 00:05:48.530
aren't you kid?

00:05:48.564 --> 00:05:49.666
Huh?

00:05:53.006 --> 00:05:55.343
H-His arm! It - grew back?!

00:05:55.377 --> 00:05:57.915
Sure did. But yours won't.

00:06:02.826 --> 00:06:14.716
[growling]

00:06:15.552 --> 00:06:17.053
Everybody, get down!

00:06:20.695 --> 00:06:23.499
Blizzblaze
Shrapnel Detonation!

00:06:30.815 --> 00:06:34.054
[laughing]

00:06:48.984 --> 00:06:49.953
Dai: Leona!

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:53.459
I'm hit - man down!

00:06:53.493 --> 00:06:56.800
Idiot! You're not
the only one who got hit!

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:59.639
Stop crying and help everyone!

00:06:59.672 --> 00:07:02.778
Dai: It'll take more
than that to beat us!

00:07:02.812 --> 00:07:06.352
How brave. But you've
already lost the battle.

00:07:06.386 --> 00:07:07.622
Oh, yeah?

00:07:07.655 --> 00:07:10.828
You see, that little move
wasn't just an attack-

00:07:10.861 --> 00:07:14.235
it was a signal to all of my
servants waiting down below...

00:07:14.268 --> 00:07:16.874
To begin an infernal battle.

00:07:16.907 --> 00:07:20.380
Baduck: Yikes!
What was that blast?!

00:07:20.413 --> 00:07:23.887
Hey! Sounds like you
need help down there!

00:07:25.725 --> 00:07:27.160
Baduck: An earthquake?

00:07:32.337 --> 00:07:33.674
What's that?

00:07:39.185 --> 00:07:41.488
[delighted chuckle]

00:07:53.613 --> 00:07:55.617
Baduck: Wh...What
in the world?

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.113
What now? What's
happening out there?!

00:08:10.146 --> 00:08:11.248
[devious laughter]

00:08:11.281 --> 00:08:13.787
The Dark Flame
Spire is complete!

00:08:14.789 --> 00:08:17.862
The Dark Ice Spire
is complete, too!

00:08:20.167 --> 00:08:21.970
Flazzard: [cackling]

00:08:22.004 --> 00:08:23.173
Showtime!

00:08:23.206 --> 00:08:26.746
Let's get on with the
entertainment, shall we, now?!

00:09:11.503 --> 00:09:13.507
Is it... over?

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.816
[chuckling]

00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:20.921
Hey- what did you
just do? What was that?!

00:09:24.696 --> 00:09:27.502
This is the
Blizzblaze Curse Field.

00:09:27.535 --> 00:09:31.008
What's the...
Blizzblaze Curse Field?

00:09:31.041 --> 00:09:32.812
Flazzard:
It's the ultimate tactic

00:09:32.846 --> 00:09:37.254
that's made my Blizzblaze
Legion unbeatable!

00:09:37.287 --> 00:09:40.828
You're all out of options now!

00:09:40.861 --> 00:09:43.432
All you can do is
scramble around...

00:09:43.466 --> 00:09:46.005
until all of you
are slaughtered!

00:09:46.038 --> 00:09:47.240
No way, buddy.

00:09:47.274 --> 00:09:49.244
You're not gonna
finish us off-

00:09:49.278 --> 00:09:51.750
especially with a puny
little earthquake like that!

00:09:51.783 --> 00:09:53.787
Then show me your worst.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.695
Popp: Fine! Cry and beg all
you like, but you're done for!

00:09:58.296 --> 00:09:59.765
Sizz!

00:10:02.137 --> 00:10:03.172
Popp: Huh?

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.776
Sizz!

00:10:04.809 --> 00:10:07.180
What's this?
What's going on?!

00:10:08.015 --> 00:10:10.387
Popp: My spell...
I can't cast Sizz!

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.623
Dai: Frizz!

00:10:13.493 --> 00:10:14.629
Oh, no.

00:10:14.662 --> 00:10:16.800
I think he's
nullified our magic?

00:10:16.833 --> 00:10:20.106
I guess it's time I
explain the rules, huh?

00:10:27.187 --> 00:10:28.422
What?!

00:10:29.291 --> 00:10:30.961
[chuckling]

00:10:30.994 --> 00:10:34.802
Dai [thought]: It's like...
It's like my strength is gone!

00:10:35.236 --> 00:10:36.238
C'mere!

00:10:40.548 --> 00:10:42.283
[pained cry]

00:10:48.029 --> 00:10:48.798
No, Dai!

00:10:48.831 --> 00:10:50.199
What's going on here?!

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:53.940
The power of his attack...
it's even stronger than before!

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:01.823
Flazzard: Oh, that's not it.
I haven't gotten stronger.

00:11:03.492 --> 00:11:05.964
So... what could it be, then?

00:11:07.067 --> 00:11:10.775
Maybe you've all
gotten weaker!

00:11:10.808 --> 00:11:12.745
Flazzard: [delighted cackle]

00:11:12.778 --> 00:11:14.414
What? But... how?

00:11:14.448 --> 00:11:16.920
Flazzard: That
Dark Flame Spire...

00:11:16.954 --> 00:11:19.792
and that Dark Ice Spire...

00:11:19.825 --> 00:11:22.765
influence the core
inside my body,

00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:24.735
and they're covering
this entire island

00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:28.309
with a field that
increases my magic power!

00:11:29.344 --> 00:11:30.948
Flazzard: Within this field,

00:11:30.981 --> 00:11:36.592
everyone but yours truly is
weakened and can't use magic.

00:11:36.626 --> 00:11:39.666
So, as long as
he's on the island,

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:42.270
this kid is weaker
than a mere human.

00:11:42.972 --> 00:11:43.941
Stop it!

00:11:43.974 --> 00:11:47.147
Flazzard: Looks like
you finally understand!

00:11:47.181 --> 00:11:50.821
But... that-
that's cheating, Flazzard!

00:11:50.854 --> 00:11:54.462
You can't even fight fair
and square, you coward!

00:11:54.495 --> 00:11:56.600
Spare me the lecture.

00:11:56.633 --> 00:11:59.572
And besides, it's not
the fighting I like.

00:11:59.605 --> 00:12:01.008
[amused chuckle]

00:12:01.042 --> 00:12:05.216
What I like...
is the winning!

00:12:09.491 --> 00:12:12.196
Victory, here I come!

00:12:29.933 --> 00:12:31.135
Maam [thought]:
It's no good!

00:12:31.169 --> 00:12:34.040
Even my Magic Bullet
Gun doesn't work.

00:12:53.078 --> 00:12:56.152
Lady Amy; is your sister
going to be alright?

00:12:56.185 --> 00:13:00.059
She's still alive, but...
my Heal spells don't work!

00:13:00.092 --> 00:13:03.867
At this rate, Marin, Apollo
and the others won't make it.

00:13:14.387 --> 00:13:16.325
[pained grunts]

00:13:16.358 --> 00:13:17.227
Dai...

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.630
We have to run!

00:13:18.663 --> 00:13:20.801
Why?! What are
you talking about?

00:13:20.835 --> 00:13:22.938
If we stay on this
island any longer...

00:13:22.972 --> 00:13:24.675
we're going to lose.

00:13:24.709 --> 00:13:26.613
We need to come
up with a plan.

00:13:26.646 --> 00:13:28.215
It's our only
option right now!

00:13:28.249 --> 00:13:32.457
No way! I am not going
to lose... not to him!

00:13:32.491 --> 00:13:34.394
If we survive,
we haven't lost!

00:13:34.427 --> 00:13:37.968
But he... he'll wipe
us out if we stay here!

00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:42.477
I'll give you a choice.

00:13:42.511 --> 00:13:45.216
Now here are your options...

00:13:45.249 --> 00:13:48.590
Frozen...
Or burned to a crisp?

00:13:48.624 --> 00:13:49.458
No!

00:13:49.491 --> 00:13:52.497
No, Maam! We can't run away!

00:13:52.531 --> 00:13:53.767
Flazzard: What?!

00:13:53.801 --> 00:13:56.104
Dai, stop being stubborn!

00:13:57.407 --> 00:13:58.710
I'm not running.

00:13:58.744 --> 00:14:00.312
You bet you aren't!

00:14:06.492 --> 00:14:07.862
Leona!

00:14:07.895 --> 00:14:10.333
I just put up the field here.

00:14:10.366 --> 00:14:13.574
It wouldn't do,
running away so soon.

00:14:13.607 --> 00:14:15.076
No! Stop it!

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:19.217
Let's make it... so you don't
even think about running away!

00:14:21.222 --> 00:14:23.392
[chuckle]

00:14:24.428 --> 00:14:34.414
[menacing laughter]

00:14:34.448 --> 00:14:39.792
[menacing laughter]

00:14:39.826 --> 00:14:41.495
Princess!

00:14:42.865 --> 00:14:51.582
[delighted laughter]

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.289
Leona!

00:14:56.125 --> 00:14:58.630
Flazzard: There.
You like that?

00:14:58.663 --> 00:15:02.070
The Princess
of Papnica on ice.

00:15:02.104 --> 00:15:03.740
But don't you worry.

00:15:03.773 --> 00:15:06.345
She's still quite
alive in there!

00:15:06.378 --> 00:15:08.148
[chuckling]

00:15:10.186 --> 00:15:13.492
Flazzard: I used Legendary
Forbidden Magic to freeze her.

00:15:13.527 --> 00:15:15.998
That means no blow
can shatter the ice

00:15:16.032 --> 00:15:18.403
and no spell can melt it.

00:15:18.436 --> 00:15:21.308
Flazzard: So what
are you supposed to do?

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:23.981
You have to beat me.

00:15:24.014 --> 00:15:27.387
Kill me, and the ice
will melt for sure.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.260
Now then, do you
still want to run?

00:15:30.293 --> 00:15:34.401
You can't abandon your
princess and flee like a rat...

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:35.905
Can you, champ?

00:15:35.938 --> 00:15:39.477
Flazzard: It's hard
being a Hero, huh?!

00:15:39.512 --> 00:15:48.696
[cackling]

00:15:53.807 --> 00:15:54.709
Dai!

00:15:54.742 --> 00:15:55.944
[pleased chuckle]

00:15:55.977 --> 00:15:57.881
There you go!

00:15:57.915 --> 00:15:59.184
Flazzard: Just like that!

00:16:00.153 --> 00:16:02.658
Flazzard: Come
and meet your fate.

00:16:02.691 --> 00:16:03.560
Popp!

00:16:03.594 --> 00:16:04.628
Y... Yeah?

00:16:05.764 --> 00:16:08.503
Help Lady Amy and get
everyone to the Balloon Ship!

00:16:08.536 --> 00:16:09.438
We're running?

00:16:09.471 --> 00:16:12.477
But Maam - we can't
leave the Princess!

00:16:12.511 --> 00:16:15.449
Look around us! We can't win
-just trust me!

00:16:15.482 --> 00:16:19.190
We have to get out and wait
for the right opportunity!

00:16:20.059 --> 00:16:21.963
We need that help now, Baduck!

00:16:21.996 --> 00:16:23.567
R-Right!

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.436
Amy: Sister, hang in there!

00:16:26.438 --> 00:16:27.306
Dai: Come on!

00:16:43.439 --> 00:16:44.240
How's that?

00:16:46.044 --> 00:16:48.348
Flazzard: Quite impressive.

00:16:48.382 --> 00:16:51.722
You've still got that
much strength in you.

00:16:53.325 --> 00:16:56.098
In this field of mine,
the strength of my enemies

00:16:56.131 --> 00:16:59.103
becomes one fifth
of what it usually is.

00:17:00.941 --> 00:17:05.551
And I've gotta admit, if that
attack were five times stronger?

00:17:05.584 --> 00:17:06.953
Talk about scary.

00:17:06.987 --> 00:17:08.388
[chuckle]

00:17:08.422 --> 00:17:09.692
However...

00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:14.769
In here, I'm afraid
a fatal wound

00:17:14.802 --> 00:17:16.907
will be impossible for you!

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.877
Dai, we have to escape!

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:20.279
No - I'm not leaving!

00:17:20.313 --> 00:17:22.851
You saw yourself what
he did to the Princess!

00:17:22.885 --> 00:17:27.259
So long as you can fight,
he's not going to hurt Leona.

00:17:27.293 --> 00:17:29.599
We need to get away-
we need a plan!

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:30.901
No! I...

00:17:30.934 --> 00:17:34.074
I'm... I'm...

00:17:34.107 --> 00:17:36.378
I'm fighting to the end!

00:17:36.412 --> 00:17:39.484
That's right.
Come now, big Hero.

00:17:39.518 --> 00:17:40.854
[chuckling]

00:17:49.938 --> 00:17:51.842
What do you think
you're doing?!

00:17:57.755 --> 00:17:58.890
Sorry, Dai!

00:17:58.923 --> 00:18:00.860
Maam, hurry!

00:18:02.898 --> 00:18:04.868
Flazzard: Oh,
I don't think so.

00:18:05.504 --> 00:18:06.873
How about...

00:18:06.906 --> 00:18:08.576
Kafrizz!

00:18:09.579 --> 00:18:10.547
...this!

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:21.068
Go! Now!

00:18:21.101 --> 00:18:22.169
Right!

00:18:32.223 --> 00:18:34.227
Why, that little-

00:18:38.636 --> 00:18:41.676
Popp: What was that
explosion back there?

00:18:41.709 --> 00:18:45.015
Maam: A bullet from
my Magic Bullet Gun.

00:18:45.049 --> 00:18:47.521
I threw one with
a Sizz spell in it.

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:52.765
When Flazzard tried to attack,
his Kafrizz set it off.

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:55.670
Wow. That was some
quick thinking, Maam.

00:18:55.704 --> 00:18:58.175
M'lady, where shall
we set course to?

00:18:58.208 --> 00:18:59.745
Let's head north.

00:18:59.779 --> 00:19:00.947
Guard: North it is.

00:19:00.981 --> 00:19:03.920
Amy: There's a rocky coast where
we should be able to hide.

00:19:07.595 --> 00:19:10.366
Flazzard: Dancing Flame Army
of the Dark Flame Spire!

00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:12.003
Knock them out of the sky...

00:19:12.036 --> 00:19:13.740
Don't let them escape!

00:19:15.977 --> 00:19:17.480
[amused chuckle]

00:19:17.515 --> 00:19:21.355
Now you just wait right
there, little Princess.

00:19:21.388 --> 00:19:24.828
Flazzard: He ain't the sort
of Hero to abandon you, is he?

00:19:28.068 --> 00:19:29.337
Popp: Normally,
I feel like running

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:32.110
the moment things
get dangerous.

00:19:32.143 --> 00:19:35.584
But for some reason,
I didn't this time.

00:19:35.618 --> 00:19:39.525
I just wish I could have done
something to save the Princess.

00:19:39.559 --> 00:19:40.693
I'm sorry.

00:19:41.996 --> 00:19:43.365
But...

00:19:44.133 --> 00:19:45.638
I know, Maam.

00:19:45.671 --> 00:19:46.606
Still...

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.709
If you hadn't done
what you did, Maam,

00:19:48.743 --> 00:19:51.916
by now I'd say
we'd all be history.

00:19:53.987 --> 00:19:55.289
Yeah.

00:19:55.323 --> 00:19:57.326
Everyone, they're coming!

00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:01.001
[snarling]

00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:02.403
Oh, man.

00:20:05.343 --> 00:20:07.581
Get us out of here, old man!

00:20:07.614 --> 00:20:08.716
R-Right!

00:20:10.052 --> 00:20:11.287
Kacrack!

00:20:12.558 --> 00:20:14.862
Okay, we're finally
out of the field-

00:20:14.895 --> 00:20:16.197
we can use magic again!

00:20:16.231 --> 00:20:17.868
[snarling]

00:20:17.901 --> 00:20:18.903
Popp: Crackle!

00:20:26.218 --> 00:20:28.956
Popp: It doesn't matter-
there's too many!

00:20:34.433 --> 00:20:36.773
Guard: We're going to
crash into the whirlpool!

00:20:36.806 --> 00:20:39.043
Yes - I can see that!

00:20:39.077 --> 00:20:41.682
Guard: Our altitude
keeps dropping!

00:20:41.715 --> 00:20:43.619
It's all over!

00:20:44.054 --> 00:20:45.055
What?!

00:20:45.089 --> 00:20:46.424
Maam: Don't give up!

00:21:01.087 --> 00:21:03.593
[worried cries]

00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:08.401
Amy: Get us closer to shore!

00:21:10.373 --> 00:21:11.809
Guard: Drop the weights!

00:21:26.906 --> 00:21:27.874
Popp: Over there!

00:21:27.908 --> 00:21:31.448
Whatever that light was,
it came from that cave.

00:21:31.481 --> 00:21:33.385
Let's go take a look.

00:21:36.391 --> 00:21:37.227
[relieved sigh]

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.361
We're here.

00:21:39.497 --> 00:21:41.970
Matoriv: Who's there?
The fools from the balloon?

00:21:42.003 --> 00:21:43.138
Uh, yes?

00:21:43.171 --> 00:21:45.577
Matoriv: If you're
all okay, get out.

00:21:45.944 --> 00:21:47.547
But... Huh?

00:21:48.015 --> 00:21:49.117
Get lost.

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:52.089
Please, sir! We're in
trouble. You have to help us!

00:21:52.123 --> 00:21:55.095
Matoriv: I don't want
anything to do with anyone.

00:21:56.799 --> 00:21:59.070
You... I know you!

00:21:59.103 --> 00:21:59.906
Matoriv: Hm?

00:21:59.939 --> 00:22:01.876
Uncle Matoriv, it's you!

00:23:37.901 --> 00:23:39.805
Narrator: After evading
Flazzard's forces,

00:23:39.839 --> 00:23:41.542
Dai and his friends
go into hiding

00:23:41.576 --> 00:23:43.814
with an old Mage
named Matoriv.

00:23:43.847 --> 00:23:46.317
And with his help,
the group devise a plan

00:23:46.351 --> 00:23:50.359
to break the Forbidden Magic's
enchantment and rescue Leona.

00:23:50.392 --> 00:23:53.866
But little do they know that
Hadlar and his Legion Commanders

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:56.304
are plotting a
scheme of their own.

00:23:56.338 --> 00:23:57.908
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:57.941 --> 00:24:00.513
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:00.546 --> 00:24:03.151
"The Grand Sorcerer Matoriv".
