WEBVTT

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:58.136
It can't be. Lon overwhelmed
Mystvearn himself.

00:01:58.169 --> 00:02:00.107
Yet against this,
his blade...

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.409
It doesn't work.

00:02:01.442 --> 00:02:04.549
Zaboera: Of course it doesn't.

00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:06.486
He's in there?

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.190
The body of this
Superior Being Zombie

00:02:08.223 --> 00:02:10.293
absorbs any impact...

00:02:10.326 --> 00:02:13.801
And no weapon in this
realm can pierce its hide.

00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:15.605
It's truly invincible!

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:17.308
[malicious chuckle]

00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:20.213
My mind is a terrifying
thing, isn't it?

00:02:20.247 --> 00:02:22.585
It certainly is
the mind of a demon.

00:02:25.157 --> 00:02:26.860
Never fear, my friends.

00:02:26.894 --> 00:02:29.298
This ghoul may
talk a big game,

00:02:29.331 --> 00:02:32.471
but we know the weakness of
the Superior Beings.

00:02:32.505 --> 00:02:33.440
Do you?

00:02:33.473 --> 00:02:36.547
Now, then! Master Br-
I mean, Mr. Beast...

00:02:36.581 --> 00:02:38.585
Show this schmuck
what you're made of.

00:02:38.618 --> 00:02:40.855
Give him a taste of
your Refractor Fist!

00:02:40.888 --> 00:02:42.224
Brokeena: I can't.

00:02:43.026 --> 00:02:44.428
Why not?!

00:02:44.461 --> 00:02:46.901
Brokeena: The Refractor Fist
overloads an opponent's biology.

00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:49.940
It won't work on a zombie
that's already dead.

00:02:49.973 --> 00:02:51.342
What?!

00:02:51.376 --> 00:02:53.146
You insolent rodent.

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:54.682
It's called an
"upgrade" because

00:02:54.716 --> 00:02:57.589
the previous version's
errors have been addressed.

00:02:57.622 --> 00:03:00.461
As it turns out, the idea
for this new iteration

00:03:00.494 --> 00:03:01.897
came from that very attack.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.501
If it has any weakness at all,

00:03:03.534 --> 00:03:05.237
it's that the
external layer may dull

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.675
the effects of
my Magic Power...

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.284
Zaboera: But if I hide
myself deep inside like so,

00:03:12.318 --> 00:03:15.491
I'm able to enchant
every tendon...

00:03:15.525 --> 00:03:19.633
And that weakness
disappears altogether!

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:22.839
Listen up - hit him with
magic-based attacks.

00:03:22.872 --> 00:03:24.809
Howling Inferno!

00:03:30.588 --> 00:03:32.224
Zaboera: Go ahead, you fools.

00:03:32.257 --> 00:03:35.064
Such pitiful magic
won't work on me now.

00:03:35.097 --> 00:03:37.635
In fact, it barely tickles!

00:03:38.003 --> 00:03:43.648
[cackling]

00:03:43.681 --> 00:03:45.685
Mystvearn:
That old scoundrel.

00:03:45.718 --> 00:03:49.358
I knew he'd reveal his
hand once he was cornered.

00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:50.961
And so, now...

00:03:52.064 --> 00:03:55.604
[growling]

00:04:06.225 --> 00:04:07.394
Crocodine [thought]: Damnit!

00:04:07.428 --> 00:04:10.433
In this form, even my
Great Axe has no effect.

00:04:10.467 --> 00:04:12.539
Zaboera: You could turn
me into a pin cushion

00:04:12.572 --> 00:04:14.542
with every spell
and weapon you've got,

00:04:14.576 --> 00:04:16.914
and I'd still be
right as rain.

00:04:16.948 --> 00:04:18.483
[victorious cackle]

00:04:18.518 --> 00:04:20.588
Zaboera: How breathtaking!

00:04:21.088 --> 00:04:22.893
Oh, no. Not again!

00:04:22.926 --> 00:04:24.361
Lon Beruk: Give me that.

00:04:25.264 --> 00:04:27.535
[roaring]

00:04:39.224 --> 00:04:41.229
Zaboera: You're
wasting your time.

00:04:41.262 --> 00:04:43.299
Lon Beruk himself
couldn't cut it.

00:04:43.332 --> 00:04:46.640
There's no way you humans
will do better than him.

00:04:46.674 --> 00:04:47.374
Oh, yeah?

00:04:47.408 --> 00:04:48.577
Lon Beruk: Calm yourself.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.316
Unfortunately, I don't
think he's bluffing.

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:53.754
None of your
attacks will work.

00:04:53.787 --> 00:04:54.656
But, sir...

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:55.658
In this state,

00:04:55.692 --> 00:04:58.029
even my force and speed
couldn't slow him down.

00:04:58.062 --> 00:04:59.464
We're completely outmatched.

00:04:59.498 --> 00:05:01.369
There's nothing
we can do here.

00:05:01.402 --> 00:05:02.371
Although...

00:05:02.404 --> 00:05:03.874
If we had an ultimate weapon

00:05:03.908 --> 00:05:07.014
that was able to channel
even more force and speed...

00:05:07.047 --> 00:05:08.951
then, maybe...

00:05:08.984 --> 00:05:12.390
I see. You mean like
the sword you made for Dai?

00:05:15.898 --> 00:05:17.935
Zaboera: Now that I
won't be interrupted,

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:20.808
allow me to get rid of
that silly Magic Circle.

00:05:20.841 --> 00:05:22.612
Bowson: Stay back,
Your Majesty!

00:05:30.393 --> 00:05:32.665
Zaboera: Of course it's you.

00:05:32.698 --> 00:05:35.370
I'm the only one who
can fight you hand to hand,

00:05:35.404 --> 00:05:37.542
and I won't let you
touch that circle.

00:05:37.576 --> 00:05:38.878
Zaboera: So persistent...

00:05:38.911 --> 00:05:41.683
but you're too puny and
weak to do a thing.

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:43.821
Zaboera: I suppose it's
only fitting - after all,

00:05:43.854 --> 00:05:46.526
this must be how
I appeared to you.

00:05:48.396 --> 00:05:50.300
Zaboera: It feels
truly magnificent

00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:52.471
to be the bigger one for once.

00:05:52.506 --> 00:05:54.509
Commandos! That's our cue!

00:05:54.542 --> 00:05:57.013
Let's get Crocodine
out of that headlock!

00:05:58.283 --> 00:06:00.353
We'll have to make
do with what we've got.

00:06:00.386 --> 00:06:03.059
It's all over if he gets
to the magic circle.

00:06:03.093 --> 00:06:04.461
We have to stop him.

00:06:04.495 --> 00:06:05.665
It's why we're here.

00:06:05.698 --> 00:06:08.002
The hero and the others
are counting on us.

00:06:08.036 --> 00:06:09.606
So it's time for
us to unite...

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:12.111
and unleash a power
that rivals Dai's own!

00:06:12.144 --> 00:06:15.216
I like your style, but in
theory that's impossible.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.920
Besides, it's like I said:

00:06:16.953 --> 00:06:20.060
You don't have a weapon
that can defeat him.

00:06:20.093 --> 00:06:21.162
Nova [thought]: A weapon...

00:06:21.195 --> 00:06:23.199
A weapon that can defeat him?

00:06:23.233 --> 00:06:25.136
There must be something...

00:06:27.041 --> 00:06:28.143
That's it.

00:06:28.176 --> 00:06:29.245
Nova?

00:06:29.278 --> 00:06:30.615
Nova: We do have a weapon...

00:06:30.648 --> 00:06:32.585
We have my life force.

00:06:32.618 --> 00:06:34.187
Your life force...

00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:35.223
You crazy?

00:06:35.257 --> 00:06:36.760
Haven't we been over this?

00:06:36.793 --> 00:06:39.064
When you gamble your
life to win a battle,

00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:40.166
it's practically
guaranteed...

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.870
you'll die in vain.

00:06:41.904 --> 00:06:44.274
I'm not throwing
it away pointlessly.

00:06:44.308 --> 00:06:46.112
I'm using it as a weapon.

00:06:46.145 --> 00:06:48.617
It's the only thing we've
got left that might be

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.722
powerful enough
to take him down.

00:06:50.755 --> 00:06:51.756
But how?

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.495
You've seen it.
A blade won't work.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.533
Nova: Not a normal sword.

00:07:00.675 --> 00:07:01.810
Nova...

00:07:02.646 --> 00:07:03.648
Nova: Here we go...

00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:04.983
This is all we can do.

00:07:05.016 --> 00:07:07.922
If we lose, the odds
won't matter anyway.

00:07:08.858 --> 00:07:11.128
[roaring]

00:07:19.412 --> 00:07:20.914
Lady Amy [thought]:
Look at his face.

00:07:20.948 --> 00:07:23.954
That attack is draining his
life right before our eyes.

00:07:23.988 --> 00:07:25.624
At this rate, he...

00:07:26.426 --> 00:07:28.830
Bowson: Enough!
Don't do this!

00:07:35.744 --> 00:07:37.882
Lon Beruk [thought]: He's
conjured a Life Blade?

00:07:38.984 --> 00:07:41.523
This ought to put
a notch in that hide.

00:07:41.556 --> 00:07:44.530
If I manage to expose
Zaboera for even a moment,

00:07:44.563 --> 00:07:45.931
it gives us a shot...

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:48.904
it gives us a chance to drag
him out of that abomination.

00:07:48.938 --> 00:07:51.510
Lon Beruk: Sorry, kid.
I can't let you do this.

00:07:51.543 --> 00:07:52.679
Out of my way.

00:07:52.712 --> 00:07:55.851
Forget it. I'm impressed
with your bravery...

00:07:55.885 --> 00:07:57.789
except I can't
ignore my conscience

00:07:57.822 --> 00:07:59.324
and let you use an attack...

00:07:59.358 --> 00:08:02.699
that is destined to fail.

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:05.236
Lon Beruk: I can tell.
It won't be enough.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.673
Even with that Life Blade,

00:08:06.707 --> 00:08:09.445
the damage you inflict
will be minimal at best.

00:08:09.478 --> 00:08:11.348
I hate to break it to you...

00:08:11.382 --> 00:08:13.554
But the power to
pierce that armor...

00:08:13.587 --> 00:08:17.928
and expose Zaboera
is beyond you. Alright?

00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:23.339
Now, extinguish the blade
before it's too late.

00:08:23.373 --> 00:08:24.876
If you conjure
it for much longer,

00:08:24.909 --> 00:08:27.681
it'll drain what
energy remains in you.

00:08:33.392 --> 00:08:35.931
Doesn't matter... if it does.

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:38.570
Nova: To be honest,

00:08:38.603 --> 00:08:40.875
I don't believe I'll win
with a single blow.

00:08:40.908 --> 00:08:43.713
But a Life Blade
cannot be broken,

00:08:43.747 --> 00:08:45.618
and as for the
damage it can do...

00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:48.824
I'm just gonna have to hit
this coward again and again.

00:08:48.858 --> 00:08:51.262
Eventually, one
of us will fall.

00:08:51.295 --> 00:08:54.301
And if I can leave even a
single scratch in his armor,

00:08:54.335 --> 00:08:55.638
that's good enough for me.

00:08:55.671 --> 00:08:57.509
Nova - you'd be dying in vain.

00:08:57.542 --> 00:08:58.544
Not in vain.

00:08:58.577 --> 00:09:00.180
This way, even if I die,

00:09:00.213 --> 00:09:03.754
I'll still be leaving you
all with a chance to live.

00:09:03.787 --> 00:09:05.958
I used to call myself a Hero,

00:09:05.991 --> 00:09:08.630
someone who helped others -
no matter the cost.

00:09:08.664 --> 00:09:11.302
It's time for me
to act like one.

00:09:11.335 --> 00:09:12.938
A Hero?

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.244
What's the matter, Nova?

00:09:32.278 --> 00:09:33.648
Nova: Ah, nothing...

00:09:33.681 --> 00:09:35.417
It's just... You're...

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.755
You're so much more
powerful than I am.

00:09:37.789 --> 00:09:40.126
Honestly, I've been
so full of myself,

00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:42.799
thinking I'd actually be
able to compete with you.

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:43.934
Between the two of us,

00:09:43.967 --> 00:09:46.405
it's clear that
you're the real Hero.

00:09:46.438 --> 00:09:48.644
Jealousy got the better of me.

00:09:48.677 --> 00:09:50.748
Forgive me. Dai Please.

00:09:50.781 --> 00:09:53.019
Water under the bridge, buddy.

00:09:53.052 --> 00:09:54.254
And you know,

00:09:54.287 --> 00:09:56.893
a difference in strength isn't
that big of a deal, either.

00:09:56.926 --> 00:09:59.932
It's not like there's a rule
that says a Hero has to be

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:01.469
the strongest
person in the world.

00:10:01.503 --> 00:10:02.905
That wouldn't make any sense.

00:10:02.939 --> 00:10:06.178
Then what exactly is it that
makes a person a real Hero?

00:10:12.324 --> 00:10:13.627
Nova: Okay, never mind.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.866
Sorry. Maybe that's
a difficult question.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.771
Well, I'm not really
sure what it is...

00:10:18.804 --> 00:10:21.844
But I do know that it's not
about who's stronger or braver.

00:10:21.877 --> 00:10:24.214
Don't stress about it;
it's only a title.

00:10:27.087 --> 00:10:30.861
Maybe that's all it is.
Everybody calls me the Hero.

00:10:30.895 --> 00:10:32.163
But back in your homeland,

00:10:32.197 --> 00:10:34.970
people call you the Hero of
the North, don't they?

00:10:35.003 --> 00:10:36.540
Yeah?

00:10:36.573 --> 00:10:38.910
Dai: There you go.
Isn't that enough?

00:10:38.944 --> 00:10:40.714
I think it might
be that simple.

00:10:40.747 --> 00:10:43.286
If I'm helping others,
and you're helping others,

00:10:43.319 --> 00:10:44.756
then what's stopping us?

00:10:44.789 --> 00:10:46.693
I say we're both Heroes.

00:10:46.726 --> 00:10:48.763
[chuckling]

00:10:48.797 --> 00:10:50.133
Nova [thought]:
Thank you, Dai.

00:10:50.166 --> 00:10:53.305
For giving me the boost
in confidence I needed...

00:10:53.339 --> 00:10:55.744
For rekindling my spirit.

00:10:57.916 --> 00:11:00.419
Nova [thought]: That's it.
That's the answer.

00:11:03.894 --> 00:11:06.032
Nova: It doesn't matter
what happens to me.

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:08.771
Being a Hero isn't
about winning or losing;

00:11:08.804 --> 00:11:10.941
it's about inspiring
courage in others -

00:11:10.975 --> 00:11:13.847
helping them get
through hard times.

00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:16.118
Nova: Even if I don't
make it out of this...

00:11:16.151 --> 00:11:19.457
Even if all I can leave you
with is a small chance...

00:11:19.491 --> 00:11:22.330
If it inspires those who
remain to pick up their arms

00:11:22.364 --> 00:11:26.773
and fight until our foe is
vanquished, then it's worth it.

00:11:26.806 --> 00:11:28.108
I'm not as strong as Dai...

00:11:28.142 --> 00:11:31.214
but that doesn't mean
I can't also be a Hero.

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:33.754
Bowson [thought]: My son...

00:11:33.787 --> 00:11:35.792
Selfishness used to
get the better of you.

00:11:35.825 --> 00:11:38.797
But you've grown.
You've grown so much.

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:41.970
Nova: Your Majesty,
I'll leave the rest to you.

00:11:42.003 --> 00:11:43.774
When I'm gone, sound the call.

00:11:43.807 --> 00:11:46.478
Tell everyone to
follow my attack.

00:11:47.047 --> 00:11:49.586
[roaring]

00:11:49.619 --> 00:11:50.555
Hold on!

00:11:50.588 --> 00:11:52.257
Nova!

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:57.735
[charging roar]

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.174
Nova: [shocked gasp]

00:12:22.619 --> 00:12:26.491
That's enough. You
can relax now, Nova.

00:12:32.538 --> 00:12:35.711
W-Why? Why would you do this?

00:12:35.744 --> 00:12:37.815
I'll admit it,
until this moment,

00:12:37.848 --> 00:12:39.785
I didn't think
that much of you.

00:12:39.819 --> 00:12:41.188
However, you've
proven me wrong.

00:12:41.221 --> 00:12:43.292
I'm impressed with what
you're willing to give up.

00:12:43.326 --> 00:12:45.664
I just can't let you
go through with it

00:12:45.697 --> 00:12:48.871
Lon Beruk: Our blood may run in
different colors, but still.

00:12:48.904 --> 00:12:51.976
It seems we value
our allies above all.

00:12:52.945 --> 00:12:54.649
Lon... we have to act.

00:12:54.682 --> 00:12:56.819
Lon Beruk: Indeed.
If a life must be spent,

00:12:56.853 --> 00:12:58.489
it might as well be mine.

00:12:58.523 --> 00:12:59.625
Lon Beruk: I've already lived

00:12:59.658 --> 00:13:02.163
at least ten times
longer than you.

00:13:02.197 --> 00:13:04.902
If I possessed the sort of
follow-through that you have,

00:13:04.936 --> 00:13:07.741
I imagine I could've
defeated our enemy

00:13:07.775 --> 00:13:09.645
on the very first strike.

00:13:09.679 --> 00:13:11.082
The time has come...

00:13:11.115 --> 00:13:12.651
I summon the ultimate weapon

00:13:12.685 --> 00:13:15.089
I've dedicated
my life to creating!

00:13:23.405 --> 00:13:25.176
Zaboera: What? No!

00:13:26.445 --> 00:13:28.850
Wh... What is that thing?

00:13:30.419 --> 00:13:32.792
Crocodine: C-Could it be...
another monster?

00:13:32.825 --> 00:13:36.098
Everyone - back.
Watch yourselves.

00:13:41.208 --> 00:13:44.615
Nova [thought]: Is... Is that
the ultimate superweapon?

00:13:47.087 --> 00:13:48.322
Zaboera: Don't you get it?

00:13:48.355 --> 00:13:50.527
It doesn't matter what
kind of force you unleash.

00:13:50.561 --> 00:13:51.395
Nothing compares to

00:13:51.428 --> 00:13:54.434
the might of my
Superior Being Zombie.

00:13:56.806 --> 00:13:58.275
Zaboera: I'll shatter
that little rock

00:13:58.309 --> 00:14:01.381
into a million pieces
before you can use it.

00:14:08.429 --> 00:14:11.435
Zaboera: What? My blades?!
It can't be...

00:14:11.469 --> 00:14:13.640
Unless... There must
be something with

00:14:13.673 --> 00:14:17.346
unbelievable power hidden
within that hunk of stone.

00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:21.055
Well, thanks.
You're a real help.

00:14:21.088 --> 00:14:24.160
Lon Beruk: You saved me
the trouble of opening it.

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:36.285
A pair of swords?

00:14:36.318 --> 00:14:37.420
Double trouble...

00:14:37.453 --> 00:14:39.593
Lon Beruk: That's right.
I call them...

00:14:39.626 --> 00:14:41.696
the Star Emperor Swords!

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.065
All: Star Emperor?!

00:14:43.098 --> 00:14:44.803
Nova [thought]:
So these two blades are

00:14:44.836 --> 00:14:46.539
his ultimate weapons?

00:14:46.572 --> 00:14:48.008
I thought they'd be bigger...

00:14:48.041 --> 00:14:50.112
Zaboera: "The Star
Emperor Swords"?

00:14:50.145 --> 00:14:52.651
You snob. What a
pretentious name!

00:14:52.684 --> 00:14:54.956
Lon Beruk: I spent over
a century designing them,

00:14:54.989 --> 00:14:57.629
and I've poured in every
ounce of my skill...

00:14:57.662 --> 00:14:59.231
To create these weapons.

00:14:59.264 --> 00:15:03.238
Weapons that were designed
to only be used by me.

00:15:07.346 --> 00:15:09.618
Zaboera [thought]:
Dual-wielding?

00:15:17.233 --> 00:15:19.004
Nova [thought]: Look
at that intensity...

00:15:19.037 --> 00:15:21.509
But will they work against
Zaboera's creation?

00:15:21.542 --> 00:15:25.851
They just look like a pair
of clumsy long swords to me.

00:15:25.884 --> 00:15:27.220
Zaboera [thought]:
If they're only swords,

00:15:27.254 --> 00:15:28.924
it doesn't matter
how strong they are,

00:15:28.957 --> 00:15:31.729
or how hard he strikes.

00:15:31.763 --> 00:15:34.367
Zaboera: I have
nothing to fear!

00:15:43.318 --> 00:15:45.055
W-Why, you...

00:15:54.307 --> 00:15:55.778
[chuckling]

00:15:55.811 --> 00:15:57.748
Ah, now I understand.

00:15:57.782 --> 00:16:00.687
You boast about these swords,
but the truth is...

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.292
you're uncertain
of their strength.

00:16:03.326 --> 00:16:04.895
[cackling]

00:16:04.929 --> 00:16:08.670
Yes... You're scared,
aren't you?

00:16:15.551 --> 00:16:18.957
Zaboera [thought]:
He... He must be...

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.328
Lon Beruk: Of
course I'm scared.

00:16:21.361 --> 00:16:22.397
Terrified, even.

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:26.271
Only, it's not because
I doubt their strength...

00:16:28.643 --> 00:16:31.749
It's because I know they
will overwhelm me.

00:16:31.782 --> 00:16:33.419
Zaboera: What?!

00:16:33.452 --> 00:16:35.524
Lon Beruk: I'll only
swing each of these blades

00:16:35.557 --> 00:16:36.458
a single time.

00:16:36.491 --> 00:16:39.497
Left and right -
one strike apiece.

00:16:39.532 --> 00:16:43.974
And when I do... even I
won't be left unscathed.

00:16:44.007 --> 00:16:46.613
[sputtering]

00:16:46.646 --> 00:16:48.716
Lon Beruk: That's why
I'm making sure that

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.053
this attack will hit you.

00:16:50.086 --> 00:16:52.692
It'll quarter you
like a piece of fruit.

00:16:52.725 --> 00:16:54.427
So here it comes.

00:16:54.461 --> 00:16:58.503
The most powerful, Lon Beruk
Style sword-technique...

00:17:06.117 --> 00:17:08.422
[furious shriek]

00:17:11.362 --> 00:17:13.766
Star Emperor Cross Slash!

00:17:25.691 --> 00:17:27.193
Zaboera: Well, look at that.

00:17:27.227 --> 00:17:30.734
It's precisely the sort
of damage I expected.

00:17:30.767 --> 00:17:33.673
Nothing! Not even one scratch!

00:17:33.707 --> 00:17:35.043
Now, I'm going to -

00:17:35.076 --> 00:17:39.551
[shrieking]

00:17:42.023 --> 00:17:45.096
[defeated roar]

00:17:45.129 --> 00:17:47.200
Lon Beruk: Enjoy
the parting gift.

00:17:47.234 --> 00:17:49.070
You can brag about
taking a direct hit

00:17:49.104 --> 00:17:51.809
from the Cross Slash
in the afterlife.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.135
It worked...

00:18:05.671 --> 00:18:11.114
[cheering]

00:18:15.489 --> 00:18:16.592
[gasp]

00:18:20.967 --> 00:18:23.506
[pained groan]

00:18:24.542 --> 00:18:25.710
Something's wrong!

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:33.125
Are you all right?

00:18:33.158 --> 00:18:34.963
What happened to your arms?

00:18:34.996 --> 00:18:36.632
Yikes. Looks painful.

00:18:36.666 --> 00:18:39.338
I... I did it again.

00:18:39.371 --> 00:18:40.172
"Again"?

00:18:40.205 --> 00:18:42.476
I had a feeling
this would happen.

00:18:42.511 --> 00:18:45.817
The Star Emperor Cross Slash
carries such a force...

00:18:45.851 --> 00:18:48.455
that when I use it, even
my finest swords shatter

00:18:48.488 --> 00:18:51.663
from the impact -
my bones, too.

00:18:51.696 --> 00:18:54.367
You see, nearly
two hundred years ago,

00:18:54.401 --> 00:18:55.938
when I first unleashed it,

00:18:55.971 --> 00:18:58.342
I lost the use of
my arms like this.

00:18:58.376 --> 00:19:00.145
The attack is simply
too extraordinary

00:19:00.179 --> 00:19:02.116
for any mortal
being to wield.

00:19:02.149 --> 00:19:03.920
The moment I tried
to perform it,

00:19:03.953 --> 00:19:05.289
I was overwhelmed
by the blast

00:19:05.322 --> 00:19:07.059
and the same
thing happened...

00:19:07.093 --> 00:19:09.497
Just as you've witnessed.

00:19:09.531 --> 00:19:12.838
Back then, I cursed the
shortcomings of my weapons

00:19:12.871 --> 00:19:14.474
more than my own abilities.

00:19:14.508 --> 00:19:16.478
So I decided to
become a weaponsmith,

00:19:16.513 --> 00:19:18.784
and vowed to create
something that could withstand

00:19:18.817 --> 00:19:20.554
the use of my full strength.

00:19:20.587 --> 00:19:23.826
That's how the Star
Emperor Swords came to be.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.365
But they never became
more than prototypes.

00:19:26.398 --> 00:19:28.369
In hindsight,
I should have completed

00:19:28.402 --> 00:19:30.607
the work on them long
before this battle.

00:19:30.641 --> 00:19:32.577
Ever since I forged
the Sword of Dai,

00:19:32.611 --> 00:19:34.982
I've put aside
my personal projects

00:19:35.015 --> 00:19:37.486
to focus on
helping his party.

00:19:37.521 --> 00:19:40.527
Perhaps the reason I worked so
hard forging that blade...

00:19:40.561 --> 00:19:43.767
was because I'd experienced
the frustration of being

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:47.642
too strong to wield
an average weapon myself.

00:19:47.675 --> 00:19:49.879
Then, you mean that
all of this time...

00:19:49.912 --> 00:19:53.085
You've been holding back on what
you're really capable of....

00:19:53.119 --> 00:19:54.689
Because you knew
if you didn't,

00:19:54.722 --> 00:19:57.326
you would only end
up destroying yourself?

00:19:58.729 --> 00:20:01.301
Nova: And even
still... for me...

00:20:01.335 --> 00:20:03.940
for all these people
you barely know...

00:20:03.974 --> 00:20:06.244
you used an
incomplete superweapon,

00:20:06.277 --> 00:20:08.616
aware of what
it would cost you?

00:20:08.649 --> 00:20:09.752
I told you, kid.

00:20:09.785 --> 00:20:11.789
Better than seeing
a Hero like you...

00:20:11.822 --> 00:20:14.662
throw away the years
to come - for nothing.

00:20:14.695 --> 00:20:17.367
I've only got one
reason to regret it...

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.204
and it's that I'm not
going to be able to

00:20:19.237 --> 00:20:22.176
make you or the others
any new weapons.

00:20:22.209 --> 00:20:25.551
My arms won't heal
for a long while.

00:20:25.584 --> 00:20:28.523
Probably not even
in your lifetimes.

00:20:35.035 --> 00:20:36.205
Well, then...

00:20:36.238 --> 00:20:38.408
Why don't you use my
hands for the time being?

00:20:38.442 --> 00:20:41.549
I can be your apprentice
until you recover fully.

00:20:41.583 --> 00:20:43.820
I owe you for saving
my life, don't I?

00:20:43.853 --> 00:20:46.391
I'll help you repair
the Star Emperor Swords,

00:20:46.425 --> 00:20:49.632
and together we can complete
your greatest design.

00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:50.701
Nova.

00:20:50.734 --> 00:20:53.071
Nova: You're not just
a fearsome warrior -

00:20:53.105 --> 00:20:55.176
you're someone
I could look up to.

00:20:55.209 --> 00:20:56.546
What do you think?

00:20:56.579 --> 00:20:59.685
If you'll let me, I wish to
learn the craft from you.

00:21:04.361 --> 00:21:06.899
I think... we'll
start you off easy.

00:21:06.933 --> 00:21:07.968
Huh?

00:21:08.001 --> 00:21:11.007
Yeah, kid. You mind
opening up a bottle for me?

00:21:12.945 --> 00:21:14.114
Sir!

00:21:14.147 --> 00:21:15.784
Bowson [thought]:
I'm proud of you, Nova.

00:21:15.817 --> 00:21:17.854
I think you're finally
finding your way.

00:21:17.888 --> 00:21:20.359
You've found someone you're
willing to see as a Master,

00:21:20.392 --> 00:21:22.631
and you have
a path to follow.

00:21:25.035 --> 00:21:26.906
This'll be fun.

00:21:26.939 --> 00:21:27.875
Well, on second thought,

00:21:27.908 --> 00:21:29.912
I guess we're starting
off with showing you

00:21:29.945 --> 00:21:31.615
how to open a big-boy bottle.

00:21:31.649 --> 00:21:36.525
[laughing]

00:22:01.609 --> 00:22:04.413
Zaboera [thought]:
C-Crocodine.

00:23:37.266 --> 00:23:39.705
Narrator: With Lon Beruk's
astonishing secret weapon,

00:23:39.738 --> 00:23:42.811
the Battle of Loroi Valley
has ended in victory,

00:23:42.845 --> 00:23:45.750
but the siege against Vearn
Palace has only begun.

00:23:45.784 --> 00:23:47.554
While the others
explore the castle,

00:23:47.588 --> 00:23:48.723
Hyunckel is overwhelmed by

00:23:48.756 --> 00:23:51.361
the endless horde of
Underworld monsters...

00:23:51.394 --> 00:23:53.566
Until a rival makes
a surprising return,

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.337
mowing down the beasts
and demanding a rematch.

00:23:56.371 --> 00:23:57.841
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:57.874 --> 00:24:00.680
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:00.714 --> 00:24:02.917
"The Survivor From Hell".
