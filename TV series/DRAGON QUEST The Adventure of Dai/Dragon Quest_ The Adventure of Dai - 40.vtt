WEBVTT

00:01:51.122 --> 00:01:53.093
Mystvearn: You are
all worthless.

00:01:53.126 --> 00:01:56.366
Nothing more than
vermin to the Dark King.

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.438
There will be no surrender.

00:01:59.472 --> 00:02:06.352
So. I will erase this kingdom,
then your entire species!

00:02:09.626 --> 00:02:13.132
Now, for the final
gasp of humanity.

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:16.205
My king sends his regards.

00:02:19.244 --> 00:02:20.214
Crocodine: The Shadow Legion.

00:02:20.247 --> 00:02:21.583
Akhim: Here they come...

00:02:21.616 --> 00:02:22.986
Popp: Vermin?!

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.424
Surrender won't be allowed?

00:02:25.457 --> 00:02:28.430
Who is he to call
anyone garbage!

00:02:28.463 --> 00:02:31.403
Well - I'll show him!
That does it!

00:02:31.436 --> 00:02:33.640
Hey, wait! I'm coming, too.

00:02:33.674 --> 00:02:36.212
Leona, when you get
the chance, run!

00:02:36.246 --> 00:02:38.851
Please, be careful-
we need you two!

00:02:40.354 --> 00:02:42.959
Chiu: Uh, what about me?!

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:47.936
Then it is decided.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.172
Huh?

00:02:49.205 --> 00:02:51.943
I will ensure that
Miss Maam and Popp are safe!

00:02:54.616 --> 00:02:56.285
Well, thank you?

00:02:57.254 --> 00:02:58.524
Popp, calm down!

00:02:58.558 --> 00:03:00.595
We're not going to beat
this guy if we lose control!

00:03:00.628 --> 00:03:04.836
I know, Maam... but that kind
of talk gets under my skin!

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:06.072
How dare he?!

00:03:06.105 --> 00:03:07.843
I'm gonna show
him that we humans

00:03:07.876 --> 00:03:09.879
aren't as weak as he thinks.

00:03:10.648 --> 00:03:12.250
But, Popp...

00:03:16.058 --> 00:03:17.161
Akhim: Curse them!

00:03:17.194 --> 00:03:19.031
You get behind me.

00:03:19.064 --> 00:03:20.200
But, you...

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:22.672
You're the one that
was injured rescuing me.

00:03:37.401 --> 00:03:39.104
What'd you think of that?

00:03:39.137 --> 00:03:40.941
Are you some kind
of immortal?!

00:03:43.046 --> 00:03:44.850
Popp: Crocodine's
surrounded.

00:03:44.883 --> 00:03:46.186
I'll go down and help them!

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:47.254
Uh, hang on-

00:03:47.287 --> 00:03:48.423
I thought your
Refractor Fist attack

00:03:48.456 --> 00:03:50.426
only worked on
living creatures?

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.565
Will it even
work on those things?

00:03:54.168 --> 00:03:55.838
For enemies like these...

00:03:55.872 --> 00:03:57.975
I have brute force!

00:04:13.808 --> 00:04:17.882
Popp: Well - I guess I won't
be teasing her anytime soon.

00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:20.287
Alright.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.159
You're up against me,
you big dumb giant.

00:04:23.193 --> 00:04:26.166
Let's see how
you deal with this!

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:27.467
Boom!

00:04:29.038 --> 00:04:30.039
Yeah, there.

00:04:30.073 --> 00:04:32.010
That should do some
serious damage.

00:04:33.213 --> 00:04:35.016
O-kay, that wasn't...

00:04:35.751 --> 00:04:37.188
[alarmed yelp]

00:04:37.221 --> 00:04:39.192
Mystvearn: Puny little fly.

00:04:39.225 --> 00:04:41.428
Miasmas, deal with him.

00:04:45.972 --> 00:04:49.411
I'm pretty sure Master said
these drain your magic!

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.048
Fizzle!

00:04:55.257 --> 00:04:57.460
Are you kidding me?!

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:07.080
Dai [thought]: Hurry.
Hurry up and finish it!

00:05:08.818 --> 00:05:09.853
Lon: Dai.

00:05:09.886 --> 00:05:11.189
Relax yourself.

00:05:11.222 --> 00:05:14.529
Your agitation is going
to affect the sword.

00:05:16.065 --> 00:05:17.468
Don't worry.

00:05:17.502 --> 00:05:20.642
Once this is complete,
there's no enemy in the world

00:05:20.675 --> 00:05:23.346
you won't be able
to go up against.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.415
Trust me.

00:05:24.448 --> 00:05:26.686
Trust the power of this sword.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.728
And trust that Jank's son and
the others can hold their own.

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:34.670
Right!

00:05:34.703 --> 00:05:37.341
Dai [thought]: I'm
counting on you, Popp, Maam,

00:05:37.374 --> 00:05:39.078
and everyone in Papnica.

00:05:39.112 --> 00:05:40.881
I'll be there soon!

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.730
Sizzle!

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:52.304
You're not gonna...

00:05:52.338 --> 00:05:54.007
Take us all down...

00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:55.978
so easily.

00:05:56.012 --> 00:05:57.749
Hang in there, Miss Maam.

00:05:57.782 --> 00:06:02.257
The gallant Chiu is on
his way to help save the day!

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:03.426
Just hold on!

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:06.165
I, Baduck, Papnica's
greatest Inventor slash

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.870
Swordsman, am coming
to save the day!

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.712
Both [thought]: Who
does he think he is?!

00:06:14.682 --> 00:06:16.252
Popp [thought]:
There's too many.

00:06:16.285 --> 00:06:18.022
If I want to take
them all out...

00:06:18.056 --> 00:06:22.932
Matoriv: Popp, I heard you used
the Five Finger Flares spell.

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:25.604
Uh, yeah. I mean, kind of.

00:06:25.638 --> 00:06:27.475
Never use it again.

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:29.579
H-Huh? Why not, mentor?

00:06:29.613 --> 00:06:32.217
It's practically
Forbidden Magic.

00:06:32.251 --> 00:06:35.691
Only a being with no regard
for it's life would use it.

00:06:35.725 --> 00:06:39.766
That kind of magic will shorten
a regular human lifespan.

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:41.737
Matoriv: I know it
was for your friends,

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.141
but if you keep
that sort of thing up-

00:06:45.912 --> 00:06:46.680
Mentor!

00:06:46.714 --> 00:06:47.815
Are you...

00:06:48.215 --> 00:06:49.051
Why didn't...

00:06:49.084 --> 00:06:50.622
Why didn't you say anything?

00:06:50.655 --> 00:06:52.859
Matoriv: It won't
be long now.

00:06:52.892 --> 00:06:56.567
Shortened as it is, a hundred
years is still too many.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.639
Considering how
few Avan and Roka got.

00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:05.752
Matoriv: Listen, Popp...

00:07:05.785 --> 00:07:07.621
Matoriv: You're still young.

00:07:07.655 --> 00:07:12.498
Don't worry. In time, you'll
learn many powerful spells.

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:14.434
Do you understand?

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.274
Akhim: What an army...

00:07:17.307 --> 00:07:18.309
Crocodine: Don't stop.

00:07:18.343 --> 00:07:20.280
Show an opening and
they'll take it.

00:07:20.314 --> 00:07:22.484
Both: Help is here!

00:07:29.565 --> 00:07:30.901
Look out, Chiu!

00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:39.051
Crocodine [thought]: Hmm.
That little one has spirit.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.424
Everyone...

00:07:42.457 --> 00:07:43.627
Matoriv: Don't worry.

00:07:43.661 --> 00:07:47.167
In time, you'll learn
many powerful spells.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.708
Popp: In time...
In time...

00:07:50.741 --> 00:07:52.444
By then it's too late.

00:07:52.477 --> 00:07:55.584
I need it right now, Mentor.

00:07:56.419 --> 00:07:57.955
Five-Finger Flares!

00:08:04.468 --> 00:08:07.909
Holy cow! When did
he learn that one?!

00:08:07.942 --> 00:08:09.212
Nice, Popp...

00:08:09.245 --> 00:08:10.581
We have to keep it up.

00:08:10.614 --> 00:08:12.017
Here we go, guys!

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:13.052
Right.

00:08:13.085 --> 00:08:16.893
Now, Vortex Axe!

00:08:30.453 --> 00:08:31.489
Popp: Everybody...

00:08:31.523 --> 00:08:32.825
Scatter!

00:08:36.533 --> 00:08:37.668
Boom!

00:08:56.305 --> 00:08:59.111
Hey, there. I got them all.

00:09:00.714 --> 00:09:02.451
P-Popp! You okay?

00:09:02.484 --> 00:09:06.059
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just a little burnt out.

00:09:06.092 --> 00:09:10.300
Now... all that's
left is that colossus.

00:09:10.333 --> 00:09:12.905
Mystvearn: [pleased chuckle]

00:09:12.939 --> 00:09:14.742
[laughing]

00:09:18.082 --> 00:09:18.985
No - what?!

00:09:19.018 --> 00:09:21.923
Mystvearn: Did you
fools think it was over?

00:09:22.858 --> 00:09:26.331
My Shadow Legion
is an immortal force.

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:28.637
So long as they
have Dark Aura,

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.808
they will continue
to resurrect...

00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:33.279
And within Sovereign
Rock Castle's chest,

00:09:33.312 --> 00:09:34.749
the Lung Chamber,

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:36.620
my Armored Warriors
are provided with

00:09:36.653 --> 00:09:39.291
a constant stream
of Dark Aura.

00:09:39.324 --> 00:09:40.694
Crocodine: The Lung Chamber?

00:09:40.727 --> 00:09:41.896
That's right.

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:44.969
The forbidden wing of
Sovereign Rock Castle.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.710
So that means their army...

00:09:48.744 --> 00:09:50.246
...will keep coming back.

00:09:51.182 --> 00:09:53.920
Baduck: W-What do we do?!

00:09:53.954 --> 00:09:56.826
Popp: I... I don't know...

00:09:57.929 --> 00:10:01.168
This... might be
the end of us!

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.082
Crocodine: But - how?!

00:10:08.116 --> 00:10:10.153
Hyunckel: You
disappoint me, Popp.

00:10:11.222 --> 00:10:13.292
I thought you were
a Disciple of Avan.

00:10:13.325 --> 00:10:16.365
He'd hate to hear you whine
about enemies like these.

00:10:17.502 --> 00:10:19.304
We just have to
defeat them all-

00:10:19.337 --> 00:10:23.245
Until they realize there's
no point in coming back.

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:24.381
Hyunckel!

00:10:24.414 --> 00:10:25.551
Look who it is.

00:10:25.585 --> 00:10:27.087
It was getting
a bit too noisy

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.957
to focus on my
training, you see.

00:10:28.991 --> 00:10:31.128
So I came to silence them.

00:10:32.397 --> 00:10:33.332
Popp [thought]:
Oh, brother...

00:10:33.365 --> 00:10:34.736
What a show-off.

00:10:34.769 --> 00:10:37.975
And of course he'd show up
at the exact right time.

00:10:39.177 --> 00:10:41.115
Chiu [thought]:
Another strange guy...

00:10:41.149 --> 00:10:45.323
Maybe I have more competition
for Miss Maam than I thought.

00:10:45.357 --> 00:10:46.559
Hyunckel.

00:10:46.593 --> 00:10:48.329
Hyunckel: Good to
see you back, Maam.

00:10:48.362 --> 00:10:52.036
But we can reminisce after
we defeat that behemoth.

00:10:53.005 --> 00:10:55.911
Mystvearn:
[delighted laughter]

00:10:55.945 --> 00:10:59.853
Mystvearn: I see you are still
absorbed in your ego, Hyunckel.

00:10:59.886 --> 00:11:02.156
Why don't you come
down here, Mystvearn?

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:05.765
You know you're going to
lose no matter what you try.

00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:08.369
It'll save us all some time.

00:11:10.541 --> 00:11:13.546
Mystvearn: You never understood
the power of my Shadow Legion...

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:17.755
and the terrors that live
within Sovereign Rock Castle.

00:11:17.788 --> 00:11:21.161
That's the armor
he gave Flazzard!

00:11:24.736 --> 00:11:27.775
Mystvearn: Go forth,
Armored Warriors!

00:11:28.644 --> 00:11:29.913
Crocodine: Three of them...

00:11:29.946 --> 00:11:30.981
Hyunckel: Stand back.

00:11:31.015 --> 00:11:33.052
Maam: Huh? But, you can't!

00:11:33.085 --> 00:11:36.258
I thought you had only
just begun your training.

00:11:36.292 --> 00:11:39.666
Hyunckel: The essence of Avan
Style isn't about the weapon.

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:40.968
Once mastered,

00:11:41.002 --> 00:11:44.875
the basics of Earth, Sea
and Air are easily applied.

00:11:46.512 --> 00:11:47.849
Hyunckel: Babysit Popp for me.

00:11:47.882 --> 00:11:50.754
Popp: Babysit?! You
all heard that, right?

00:11:51.723 --> 00:11:54.294
L-look out! They're
coming this way!

00:11:56.633 --> 00:11:58.102
Unleash... Earth Strike!

00:12:00.473 --> 00:12:01.341
Look out!

00:12:03.647 --> 00:12:05.016
Popp: He's fast.

00:12:08.122 --> 00:12:09.860
That first attack
was Earth Strike,

00:12:09.893 --> 00:12:13.199
a powerful move
comparable to Earth Slash.

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:14.201
And the second...

00:12:14.235 --> 00:12:17.508
was the Avan Style Spear
Technique's fastest...

00:12:17.541 --> 00:12:19.277
The Wave Strike.

00:12:21.617 --> 00:12:23.553
Hyunckel: It hardly
bears mentioning,

00:12:23.586 --> 00:12:25.390
but the strongest
attack I have...

00:12:25.423 --> 00:12:28.898
Is powerful no matter
what kind of weapon I use.

00:12:28.931 --> 00:12:30.300
I know that stance...

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:32.236
Bloody Scryde!

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.216
Amazing, Hyunckel!

00:12:38.249 --> 00:12:40.854
Crocodine: He easily
destroyed the enemies

00:12:40.887 --> 00:12:43.292
that we were struggling with!

00:12:43.325 --> 00:12:44.494
Ugh, all right...

00:12:44.528 --> 00:12:48.770
Never tell him I said this,
but he really is a genius.

00:12:49.438 --> 00:12:51.174
Oh, that's... Grand Cross!

00:12:51.208 --> 00:12:53.046
Hyunckel: Enough
with the games.

00:12:53.079 --> 00:12:57.220
Come out, or I'll demolish
the castle with you in it!

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:10.547
Why did it stop?

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.498
Right - I've got
you now, Mystvearn!

00:13:19.533 --> 00:13:21.035
All of you get back.

00:13:21.068 --> 00:13:22.705
Popp: Don't be stupid.

00:13:22.738 --> 00:13:24.809
Give someone else
a chance to show off!

00:13:24.843 --> 00:13:26.879
I said to get back.

00:13:29.451 --> 00:13:31.556
What is his problem?

00:13:31.589 --> 00:13:33.593
Forgive him, Popp.

00:13:33.627 --> 00:13:36.766
Mystvearn himself taught
Hyunckel the Dark Technique

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.238
back when he was in
the Dark Army.

00:13:39.271 --> 00:13:40.173
What?!

00:13:40.206 --> 00:13:42.811
Crocodine: If Avan
is his Master of Light,

00:13:42.845 --> 00:13:46.552
Mystvearn is his
Master of Darkness.

00:13:46.586 --> 00:13:50.193
This is a battle between
a teacher and their student.

00:13:50.226 --> 00:13:54.802
For Hyunckel, this could
settle his own dark past.

00:13:54.836 --> 00:13:57.608
Looks like you're
finally ready to fight me.

00:13:57.641 --> 00:13:59.110
Huh, Mystvearn?

00:14:11.468 --> 00:14:13.807
Mystvearn: Let me
make one thing clear.

00:14:13.841 --> 00:14:15.811
Your pitiful attack
wouldn't have put

00:14:15.845 --> 00:14:17.681
a scratch in
this moving fortress.

00:14:17.714 --> 00:14:21.088
I am here because
I choose to be.

00:14:21.121 --> 00:14:23.025
You betrayed
the Dark Army and

00:14:23.059 --> 00:14:24.929
embarrassed me in
front of King Vearn.

00:14:24.962 --> 00:14:28.035
I intend to
punish you myself.

00:14:28.068 --> 00:14:30.708
You've become quite
the talker, haven't you?

00:14:30.741 --> 00:14:32.745
Even back when you
were training me,

00:14:32.779 --> 00:14:35.182
you barely said this much.

00:14:36.719 --> 00:14:38.155
I'm not offended or anything.

00:14:38.189 --> 00:14:40.828
'Cause I'm going to make
you like you used to be.

00:14:40.861 --> 00:14:42.732
Once I destroy you...

00:14:42.765 --> 00:14:45.002
you'll be quiet forever!

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.012
Mystvearn: Not with
your strength, child.

00:14:50.046 --> 00:14:51.616
Hyunckel: You run from me?

00:15:03.239 --> 00:15:05.243
His attacks are even faster.

00:15:05.276 --> 00:15:06.579
Get him! Do it!

00:15:12.691 --> 00:15:15.396
Hyunckel [thought]: What
was that? What did he do?!

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:17.802
Mystvearn: Such hastily
learned spear technique

00:15:17.835 --> 00:15:20.707
cannot match my savage blow.

00:15:20.741 --> 00:15:22.411
You're about to find out-

00:15:22.444 --> 00:15:25.183
How "hasty" can feel!

00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:29.090
Avan Style Spear
Technique, Wave Strike!

00:15:29.124 --> 00:15:31.294
Mystvearn: Byut
Deathstringer!

00:15:31.328 --> 00:15:32.297
Hyunckel [thought]:
His finger...

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.334
A rapidly moving steel claw...

00:15:36.404 --> 00:15:37.508
Not fast enough!

00:15:38.041 --> 00:15:39.210
Mystvearn: Fool.

00:15:39.244 --> 00:15:41.682
This attack can be done
with any of my fingers.

00:15:43.921 --> 00:15:45.824
Mystvearn: This...
This is...

00:15:45.857 --> 00:15:47.662
I know that one!

00:15:47.695 --> 00:15:49.565
Dark Puppetry Aura Hand!

00:15:49.598 --> 00:15:53.305
As a skill of darkness, I never
intended to use this again.

00:15:53.339 --> 00:15:55.276
But it'll make a
fitting end for you.

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:58.248
The skill you taught me
will be your undoing.

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:03.292
That's good. Now turn your
claw back on yourself.

00:16:07.267 --> 00:16:08.536
Do it!

00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:12.210
[gasps]

00:16:17.555 --> 00:16:18.857
W-What?

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.161
Im...possible!

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:24.735
Hyunckel, no!

00:16:24.769 --> 00:16:26.438
Hyunckel: This can't be...

00:16:26.472 --> 00:16:31.014
My... My Dark Puppetry
Aura Hand is perfect.

00:16:31.047 --> 00:16:34.321
You've said yourself
that it surpasses yours!

00:16:34.354 --> 00:16:36.025
Mystvearn: I thought it did.

00:16:36.058 --> 00:16:38.162
But you're weaker
now than when you were

00:16:38.195 --> 00:16:40.668
the Undead Legion Commander.

00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:41.969
What? How?!

00:16:42.003 --> 00:16:43.574
Mystvearn: Having
sided with justice,

00:16:43.607 --> 00:16:47.213
your Dark Aura is
not what it once was!

00:16:48.015 --> 00:16:49.552
[pained howl]

00:16:50.553 --> 00:16:52.223
What... are you?

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:57.601
Mystvearn: Did your father
never give you a toy?

00:16:57.634 --> 00:16:58.536
Hyunckel: What?!

00:17:01.241 --> 00:17:05.115
Mystvearn: It's time you learned
what happens to broken toys.

00:17:07.588 --> 00:17:08.756
Hyunckel!

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:14.935
M-Maam?!

00:17:14.969 --> 00:17:16.505
Maam, no!

00:17:17.107 --> 00:17:18.476
Hyunckel: Y-you fool...

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:19.812
That was reckless.

00:17:19.845 --> 00:17:21.348
Mystvearn: Indeed.

00:17:23.787 --> 00:17:25.189
Popp: H-How did he...

00:17:25.222 --> 00:17:28.495
Mystvearn: I suppose it was
more pointless than reckless.

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:32.905
To sustain wounds for
one as useless as him.

00:17:32.938 --> 00:17:34.207
What do you know?!

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.978
He's the best
swordsman I know.

00:17:36.011 --> 00:17:37.380
He isn't useless!

00:17:37.414 --> 00:17:39.051
Mystvearn: His
skills came from

00:17:39.084 --> 00:17:42.190
when he was a soldier
for the Dark Army.

00:17:42.223 --> 00:17:45.096
Now he doesn't have
enough light or darkness

00:17:45.129 --> 00:17:48.202
in him to be
useful with either.

00:17:48.235 --> 00:17:49.471
How dare you?

00:17:49.505 --> 00:17:53.045
I've... never
neglected my training.

00:17:53.079 --> 00:17:55.249
I can use both
sword and spear.

00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:57.220
There's no way
I've grown weak.

00:17:57.253 --> 00:17:59.457
If anything,
I'm more powerful!

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:01.228
Mystvearn: The
reason is simple.

00:18:01.262 --> 00:18:06.305
Your Dark Aura has
diminished in power.

00:18:06.338 --> 00:18:09.545
Mystvearn: It once overflowed
with hatred for Avan.

00:18:09.578 --> 00:18:12.417
Hatred which I taught
you to control.

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:15.624
But the great King
Vearn saw through you.

00:18:15.657 --> 00:18:18.863
He saw the deeply
buried feelings you had

00:18:18.896 --> 00:18:20.633
for your master.

00:18:22.236 --> 00:18:24.441
Mystvearn: Deep down,
you admired Avan

00:18:24.474 --> 00:18:27.447
and were grateful
for his kindness.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.852
Your single-minded
obsession with revenge

00:18:29.885 --> 00:18:32.524
made you bury such feelings.

00:18:32.557 --> 00:18:36.599
As a result, you possessed
polar opposite energies.

00:18:36.632 --> 00:18:41.408
Your body contained both the
Aura of Justice and Darkness.

00:18:41.441 --> 00:18:43.913
It made you the
ultimate warrior.

00:18:43.947 --> 00:18:47.821
A being wielding the powers
of both good and evil.

00:18:47.855 --> 00:18:52.698
That was the secret to
your undying strength.

00:18:54.434 --> 00:18:56.572
Mystvearn: Having
succumbed to justice

00:18:56.605 --> 00:19:00.614
and using Aura of Light
attacks like Grand Cross,

00:19:00.648 --> 00:19:04.354
your power is only
half of what it was.

00:19:04.387 --> 00:19:08.395
Whereas my Dark Powers
are uncorrupted.

00:19:08.429 --> 00:19:12.838
You lie. All you've
ever done is lie.

00:19:12.871 --> 00:19:13.940
Hyunckel...

00:19:13.974 --> 00:19:15.309
Mystvearn: It's the truth.

00:19:15.342 --> 00:19:19.151
And now I shall
dispose of my mistake.

00:19:19.184 --> 00:19:22.223
You won't harm Hyunckel.
I'll fight you!

00:19:22.256 --> 00:19:23.325
Maam, wait.

00:19:23.358 --> 00:19:25.764
And it's not just
Maam, either.

00:19:25.798 --> 00:19:28.335
Don't forget the rest
of us are here as well!

00:19:28.369 --> 00:19:29.738
Chiu: That's right!

00:19:30.406 --> 00:19:32.377
All of us at once, huh?

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:34.715
Even for you, that's too many.

00:19:35.517 --> 00:19:36.920
Mystvearn: Foolish insects.

00:19:36.953 --> 00:19:40.627
You can't even see you're
already caught in my web.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:41.394
Crocodine: What?!

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.336
What is this?
It's like a spider's web!

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:48.475
Mystvearn: Dark Puppetry
Aura Decimation Field!

00:19:53.418 --> 00:19:56.324
This is Dark
Puppetry Aura Hand!

00:19:56.358 --> 00:19:58.830
Crocodine: He's caught
everyone here all at once?!

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:01.268
Hyunckel [thought]:
Unbelievable.

00:20:01.301 --> 00:20:04.742
Is this the depth of
Mystvearn's Dark Aura?!

00:20:06.077 --> 00:20:07.280
He's unbeatable!

00:20:07.313 --> 00:20:08.616
If I'm going to fight,

00:20:08.649 --> 00:20:12.189
I'll have to resist him
with my own Dark Power...

00:20:12.223 --> 00:20:13.960
Mystvearn: I'm
the only one who can

00:20:13.993 --> 00:20:16.231
move within the
Decimation Field.

00:20:16.264 --> 00:20:18.335
What will you do, Hyunckel?

00:20:18.368 --> 00:20:20.339
Mystvearn: If you
don't believe me,

00:20:20.372 --> 00:20:23.245
Why don't you try to
stop this flow of Aura

00:20:23.279 --> 00:20:26.384
with your own Dark Power.

00:20:27.119 --> 00:20:28.723
C-Curse you...

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:30.961
Curse you...

00:20:30.994 --> 00:20:32.497
M-Mystvearn...

00:20:32.531 --> 00:20:34.401
Don't do it, Hyunckel!

00:20:34.434 --> 00:20:36.506
Hyunckel [thought]:
My wrath is burning...

00:20:36.539 --> 00:20:39.845
Burning with all of
my hatred and malice!

00:20:41.716 --> 00:20:43.386
You can't!

00:20:43.419 --> 00:20:44.889
Hyunckel: The power...

00:20:44.922 --> 00:20:47.595
The Dark Power...

00:20:47.628 --> 00:20:51.468
Mystvearn: You won't move a
finger with darkness like that.

00:20:51.502 --> 00:20:52.872
Hyunckel [thought]: Hate...

00:20:52.905 --> 00:20:54.808
Hate him...

00:20:54.842 --> 00:20:57.981
Just as I once hated Avan!

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:01.454
Please, just stop!

00:21:03.292 --> 00:21:04.695
But, Maam...

00:21:04.729 --> 00:21:07.768
I know that we may not make
it out of here alive...

00:21:07.801 --> 00:21:11.609
if you keep resisting
what evil you may have...

00:21:13.713 --> 00:21:14.815
But I...

00:21:14.848 --> 00:21:19.457
I just can't bear to see
those painful eyes ever again!

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:24.033
Maam: If you're
going to fight,

00:21:24.067 --> 00:21:26.137
fight with the
power of good...

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:29.111
And I know...
you can win this!

00:21:29.144 --> 00:21:30.379
Maam...

00:21:31.616 --> 00:21:34.320
Mystvearn: I see you've
stopped resisting.

00:21:34.354 --> 00:21:38.195
So be it. You'll
perish together!

00:21:38.229 --> 00:21:40.399
Byut Deathstringer!

00:21:47.848 --> 00:21:50.787
Mystvearn: What?!
The Decimation Field...

00:21:50.821 --> 00:21:53.960
Hyunckel: I almost made the
same foolish mistake again.

00:21:53.994 --> 00:21:56.833
But I... I choose...

00:21:56.866 --> 00:21:59.938
the Light of Justice!

00:23:37.199 --> 00:23:40.039
Narrator: As Sovereign Rock
Castle closes in on the summit,

00:23:40.072 --> 00:23:42.844
Popp and the others remain
trapped in Mystvearn's web.

00:23:42.878 --> 00:23:47.052
Soon his Dark Aura overwhelms
even Hyunckel's Aura of Light.

00:23:47.086 --> 00:23:49.925
But just when it seems
that Papnica is lost,

00:23:49.959 --> 00:23:54.433
Dai intervenes with a
brand new sword in hand.

00:23:54.467 --> 00:23:56.939
Will he be able to
overcome this peril?
