WEBVTT

00:01:52.024 --> 00:01:53.928
Baran: Thank you for coming.

00:01:53.961 --> 00:01:55.397
I've been waiting.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.504
It's been three
years, hasn't it?

00:01:58.538 --> 00:02:00.609
Too long since we
were last summoned.

00:02:00.642 --> 00:02:03.480
Requiring all of us
means it's something big.

00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:06.152
Something that could
test our strength.

00:02:06.186 --> 00:02:09.760
Has the time come for
some real destruction?

00:02:09.793 --> 00:02:11.697
[excited chuckle]

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.203
It would seem that my son,
Dino, is alive after all.

00:02:15.638 --> 00:02:17.174
Master Dino?

00:02:17.207 --> 00:02:20.046
Baran: The Hero Dai,
who fights the Dark Army,

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.317
is my long lost son.

00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:24.890
Oh, really? What a
cruel twist of fate.

00:02:24.924 --> 00:02:29.432
I've already fought the group of
warriors the boy is leading...

00:02:29.465 --> 00:02:33.273
The bond between them all was
stronger than I anticipated,

00:02:33.306 --> 00:02:35.611
and I was forced to concede.

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:38.518
But - how is that possible?!

00:02:38.551 --> 00:02:40.086
I guess that it explains it;

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.224
why we're out
here at Argo Point.

00:02:42.257 --> 00:02:45.263
This is where the Fountain
of Miracles resides.

00:02:45.297 --> 00:02:48.771
It's a place of healing
for the Dragon Knights.

00:02:48.805 --> 00:02:51.777
However, that was not my
only reason for coming here.

00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:54.281
Larhart [thought]: He's
thinking about his wife.

00:02:54.314 --> 00:02:56.185
We understand, General Baran.

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:58.323
You'll be needing the
three of us to assist

00:02:58.356 --> 00:03:00.561
in the capturing
of young Master Dino.

00:03:00.594 --> 00:03:04.703
Baran: Exactly. My son has
made troublesome allies.

00:03:04.736 --> 00:03:08.243
They would risk death
for Dai, the Hero.

00:03:08.276 --> 00:03:10.782
Also; there are
the Legion Commanders

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:12.484
who betrayed our army.

00:03:12.518 --> 00:03:14.388
The Beast King and
the Dark Swordsman

00:03:14.421 --> 00:03:16.025
are not to be
underestimated...

00:03:16.058 --> 00:03:17.662
Do you understand?

00:03:17.695 --> 00:03:18.998
You're joking!

00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:20.868
Some Legion Commander?

00:03:20.902 --> 00:03:25.544
None from the Dark Army besides
you could stand up to us.

00:03:25.578 --> 00:03:28.249
Baran: You may be the
most powerful Dragon Riders

00:03:28.282 --> 00:03:32.124
of all the Darklings
and Beastlings, but beware.

00:03:32.157 --> 00:03:34.896
The humans can display
terrifying strength

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:36.767
when they're
prepared to die.

00:03:37.502 --> 00:03:39.572
If his allies should resist,

00:03:39.606 --> 00:03:43.312
the three of you
must crush them.

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:48.189
In the meantime,
I shall reclaim my son.

00:03:48.223 --> 00:03:49.224
All: Sir!

00:03:49.258 --> 00:03:51.129
Baran: I must
prepare for battle.

00:03:51.162 --> 00:03:53.366
Wait for me here.

00:03:54.636 --> 00:03:58.376
Galdandy: Master Baran
is ever the cautious one.

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:02.118
They're only a few humans
and a couple of traitors.

00:04:02.151 --> 00:04:04.122
Watch your tongue, Galdandy!

00:04:04.155 --> 00:04:05.357
Indeed.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.363
A lion does not hold
back when it hunts a hare.

00:04:08.397 --> 00:04:11.168
Don't forget that his
caution is what has kept

00:04:11.202 --> 00:04:15.276
our glorious Dragon
Legion undefeated.

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:18.717
Galdandy: Yeah,
yeah, yeah...

00:04:24.495 --> 00:04:26.566
Baran [thought]: Soala,
I will get our son back

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.904
from those filthy humans.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.051
[fearsome roar]

00:04:36.085 --> 00:04:39.158
[roaring]

00:04:39.192 --> 00:04:43.499
Baran: Now, my Dragon Legion,
we ride to the Teran Kingdom.

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:46.306
When my son Dino
joins our forces,

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:48.209
our strength
shall be absolute!

00:04:48.243 --> 00:04:49.278
All: Sir!

00:04:49.311 --> 00:04:51.683
Right, then! Follow me!

00:05:01.436 --> 00:05:02.739
Nabara: What a surprise.

00:05:02.772 --> 00:05:04.442
With everyone calling
you "Princess,"

00:05:04.475 --> 00:05:06.112
I wondered who you were.

00:05:06.145 --> 00:05:09.118
So you're the
ruler of Papnica.

00:05:09.151 --> 00:05:10.320
It's good you're here.

00:05:10.354 --> 00:05:12.625
Otherwise, small
as Teran may be,

00:05:12.658 --> 00:05:16.432
its king would not be so
inclined to hear from us.

00:05:20.373 --> 00:05:21.810
His Grace will see you now.

00:05:21.843 --> 00:05:23.781
He is not feeling
well and asks

00:05:23.814 --> 00:05:26.987
that you forgive an
audience in his chambers.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.557
That will be fine.

00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:30.628
I'll wait outside.

00:05:30.662 --> 00:05:32.464
Call me when you're done.

00:05:35.103 --> 00:05:36.740
How intriguing.

00:05:36.774 --> 00:05:41.550
That supernatural storm was
caused by the Dragon Knight.

00:05:41.583 --> 00:05:46.426
And this child is
none other than his son.

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:49.065
It may have been a
Psychic Signal of some kind

00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:50.735
that took his memories.

00:05:50.768 --> 00:05:51.837
Psychic Signal?

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.141
King Teran: Think
of it as a mental wave

00:05:54.174 --> 00:05:57.013
emitted from
the Dragon Crest.

00:05:57.047 --> 00:06:00.087
So how can we get his
memory back to normal?

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.757
Sadly, I do not know.

00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:04.629
We merely worship
the God of Dragons.

00:06:04.662 --> 00:06:06.800
We know the history
of the Dragon Knight,

00:06:06.834 --> 00:06:09.038
but we've barely
begun to understand

00:06:09.071 --> 00:06:10.741
the extent of their powers.

00:06:10.774 --> 00:06:12.244
I understand.

00:06:12.277 --> 00:06:13.848
Then... will you
please protect Dai

00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:16.385
in your fortress for
a time, your majesty?

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.758
King Teran: You
still wish to fight?

00:06:18.791 --> 00:06:20.060
Yes, we do.

00:06:20.093 --> 00:06:21.495
While the people of Teran...

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.437
may regard Baran's attack
as some kind of divine will...

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.875
It's an attack
against humanity,

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:30.615
And we stand against
any aggression.

00:06:30.648 --> 00:06:31.783
I see.

00:06:31.816 --> 00:06:35.356
I had heard of the bravery
of the Princess of Papnica.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.031
[coughing]

00:06:39.064 --> 00:06:40.100
Kanar...

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:41.135
Your Grace?

00:06:41.168 --> 00:06:45.444
You will aid the Princess
Leona and her party.

00:06:45.477 --> 00:06:46.913
Yes, of course, Sire.

00:06:46.947 --> 00:06:49.953
Thank you very much,
Your Highness.

00:06:50.821 --> 00:06:54.997
Now tell me, are
you the famous Seers?

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.467
Quite so. My name is Nabara.

00:06:57.502 --> 00:06:58.837
King Teran: And this one?

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.543
This is my
granddaughter, Merle.

00:07:01.576 --> 00:07:03.146
Come a bit closer.

00:07:03.179 --> 00:07:04.014
Merle: Huh?

00:07:06.052 --> 00:07:07.487
Yes, sire.

00:07:15.972 --> 00:07:19.178
You possess power
beyond your grandmother's.

00:07:19.211 --> 00:07:20.581
That is true.

00:07:20.615 --> 00:07:24.454
Recently, she's been able to
sense things which I cannot.

00:07:25.558 --> 00:07:28.931
Before too long, your
power shall show you all

00:07:28.965 --> 00:07:32.371
of the terrifying and
horrible things to come.

00:07:32.404 --> 00:07:33.440
Merle: What?!

00:07:33.473 --> 00:07:35.978
Do not resent your
very special gift.

00:07:36.012 --> 00:07:39.786
It will someday
help save humanity.

00:07:39.819 --> 00:07:43.861
Trust that day will arrive,
and live strong.

00:07:43.894 --> 00:07:45.263
Yes...

00:07:45.296 --> 00:07:48.704
[troubled gasps]

00:07:49.238 --> 00:07:50.473
Popp: What's wrong?

00:07:50.507 --> 00:07:53.513
Merle: An energy of great
wrath - it's coming...

00:07:53.547 --> 00:07:55.083
Straight for this kingdom!

00:07:55.116 --> 00:07:56.520
You mean Baran?

00:07:56.553 --> 00:07:58.356
Wait - he's coming already?

00:07:58.389 --> 00:07:59.659
Merle: That's not all.

00:07:59.693 --> 00:08:02.464
There are other,
similar energies...

00:08:02.497 --> 00:08:03.800
Three of them.

00:08:07.542 --> 00:08:08.877
What are you doing?

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.048
Let me... Let me out of here!

00:08:11.081 --> 00:08:13.520
-Isn't this going too far?
-Dai: Hey! Let me out!

00:08:13.554 --> 00:08:15.692
Possibly. The dungeon
is the deepest and most

00:08:15.725 --> 00:08:18.096
impregnable place
in the entire castle.

00:08:18.129 --> 00:08:21.570
-B-But...
-Dai: Let me out! Let me out!

00:08:21.604 --> 00:08:23.674
[distressed sobbing]

00:08:23.707 --> 00:08:27.080
Crocodine: Young lady, do
you know what imprinting is?

00:08:27.114 --> 00:08:28.216
Huh?

00:08:28.249 --> 00:08:31.690
Whenever a beast of my
species hatches from its egg,

00:08:31.723 --> 00:08:35.497
it assumes the first thing
it sees is its parent.

00:08:35.531 --> 00:08:37.602
Crocodine: Baran's reduced Dai

00:08:37.635 --> 00:08:40.574
to the state of a
newly hatched infant.

00:08:40.608 --> 00:08:43.479
If Dai encounters him now,

00:08:43.513 --> 00:08:46.753
he'll probably accept
Baran as his father.

00:08:47.722 --> 00:08:51.997
The mark they both bear
is irrefutable proof.

00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:57.041
It may seem cruel, but this is
the only way to prevent that.

00:08:57.074 --> 00:08:59.746
We can take care of
the rest, I'm sure.

00:08:59.779 --> 00:09:01.449
Please guard your king.

00:09:01.482 --> 00:09:04.756
Yes, your majesty.
I'm on my way.

00:09:09.098 --> 00:09:10.567
Poor Dai...

00:09:15.812 --> 00:09:20.354
Nabara: They're headed straight
for Teran from the southeast.

00:09:20.387 --> 00:09:22.490
Can you show us, Nabara?

00:09:22.525 --> 00:09:24.060
Nabara: I think so.

00:09:37.388 --> 00:09:38.891
Who are those guys?

00:09:38.924 --> 00:09:42.430
They're the other sources
of energy you sensed, Merle.

00:09:42.464 --> 00:09:45.003
Could they be
the Dragon Masters?

00:09:45.036 --> 00:09:46.205
The Dragon who?

00:09:46.238 --> 00:09:49.812
The most powerful
beings who serve Baran.

00:09:49.845 --> 00:09:52.184
With Dragons under
their control,

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:55.958
they're said to rival even
the Legion Commanders.

00:09:55.991 --> 00:09:59.297
You mean he's got three
sidekicks as tough as you?

00:09:59.331 --> 00:10:01.402
Crocodine [thought]: We
may not be strong enough

00:10:01.435 --> 00:10:03.574
to hold them back.

00:10:03.607 --> 00:10:07.247
Fighting Baran alone
was difficult enough.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.153
If only Hyunckel were here.

00:10:13.894 --> 00:10:17.267
Popp: [defeated laughter]

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.541
Well, I guess that blows it.
We're definitely done for.

00:10:20.574 --> 00:10:21.743
What? Popp...

00:10:21.777 --> 00:10:24.983
Really sorry, but I am
not dying for nothing.

00:10:25.016 --> 00:10:26.184
I'm bailing out.

00:10:26.218 --> 00:10:29.559
You guys can do whatever-
and I mean whatever - you like.

00:10:29.592 --> 00:10:30.861
So, you're saying that-

00:10:30.894 --> 00:10:32.631
That you're not
going to help us?

00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:34.736
I'm saying that I am out.

00:10:34.769 --> 00:10:38.108
If they're that strong,
there's no point in resisting.

00:10:38.142 --> 00:10:40.179
You're all just
fooling yourselves.

00:10:40.213 --> 00:10:43.720
But Popp, do you understand
what that would mean?

00:10:43.754 --> 00:10:46.091
Popp: You're the ones
who don't understand.

00:10:46.124 --> 00:10:50.033
Dai barely knows who he is,
we're falling apart,

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:52.605
and now we're facing
the toughest Legion...

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:56.613
With those odds, you'd have to
be crazy to consider fighting.

00:10:56.647 --> 00:10:58.817
And I thought that
fighting for your friends,

00:10:58.851 --> 00:11:00.754
even when there's no hope,

00:11:00.787 --> 00:11:04.194
was what you Disciples
of Avan truly believed in.

00:11:04.228 --> 00:11:06.666
If Dai falls into
the wrong hands now,

00:11:06.699 --> 00:11:08.671
then the human world will end.

00:11:08.704 --> 00:11:09.739
He's right.

00:11:09.772 --> 00:11:11.710
I thought you were
Dai's best friend.

00:11:11.743 --> 00:11:13.547
Are you really
willing to abandon him

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.483
now after all this time?

00:11:15.518 --> 00:11:16.486
[scoffing]

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.855
Don't worry about him.

00:11:17.888 --> 00:11:20.393
After all, he's
not even a human.

00:11:20.426 --> 00:11:22.430
Popp: He is one
of them, isn't he?

00:11:22.463 --> 00:11:24.703
So why not just give him back?

00:11:24.736 --> 00:11:26.539
They'll take
good care of him.

00:11:26.573 --> 00:11:29.979
[laughing]

00:11:32.785 --> 00:11:35.657
Fine, then.
Get out of my sight.

00:11:35.691 --> 00:11:38.429
Cowards aren't much
use to us anyway.

00:11:40.333 --> 00:11:41.836
Well, that's a relief.

00:11:41.869 --> 00:11:43.172
Thanks a lot!

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.709
No, Popp...

00:11:44.742 --> 00:11:46.111
Wait a minute.

00:11:46.145 --> 00:11:48.617
Do not go after
him, Crocodine.

00:11:48.651 --> 00:11:52.157
We still need you here,
defending this position.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:53.927
Yes, but...

00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:59.304
Princess?

00:11:59.337 --> 00:12:02.778
Leona: I've always admired
the Disciples of Avan.

00:12:03.747 --> 00:12:06.786
I was actually hoping to
learn from Master Avan

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.489
before we lost him.

00:12:09.926 --> 00:12:12.063
I believed that Popp
would stay with us

00:12:12.097 --> 00:12:14.502
because he was one
of those Disciples.

00:12:20.915 --> 00:12:23.687
What could have happened
to all of your courage,

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.455
young Popp?

00:12:24.488 --> 00:12:26.358
P-Popp?

00:12:27.862 --> 00:12:30.534
Popp... Who?

00:12:36.245 --> 00:12:37.246
Merle: Stop!

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:40.052
M-Merle?

00:12:40.788 --> 00:12:42.156
Was it all a lie?

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:46.566
You said Dai was your friend,
even if he was a monster!

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.902
Were those words...

00:12:47.935 --> 00:12:48.703
Those tears...

00:12:48.737 --> 00:12:50.339
All a lie?

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.156
Then I...

00:12:58.189 --> 00:12:59.391
I hate you.

00:13:00.928 --> 00:13:03.432
I can't believe I
actually liked you!

00:13:09.311 --> 00:13:10.179
Y'know, it's funny-

00:13:10.213 --> 00:13:11.849
this reminds me of
that time when Maam

00:13:11.883 --> 00:13:14.387
punched me and said
I disgusted her.

00:13:16.125 --> 00:13:19.098
Popp [thought]: But this
isn't like back then!

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:23.072
If I tried to go alone,
you'd all stop me.

00:13:23.105 --> 00:13:27.180
That's why I had to
say that. I'm sorry.

00:13:27.916 --> 00:13:29.719
Look after Dai, everyone.

00:13:29.752 --> 00:13:32.625
I'll stop them, even
if I don't come back.

00:13:32.658 --> 00:13:33.994
I may not win,

00:13:34.027 --> 00:13:37.100
but I'll at least take one
or two of them out with me.

00:13:37.802 --> 00:13:40.139
So take care of the rest!

00:13:56.071 --> 00:13:58.175
Popp: Stop right there!

00:14:01.616 --> 00:14:03.520
You're not going any farther.

00:14:05.724 --> 00:14:08.129
Look who's here to stop us.

00:14:08.162 --> 00:14:09.932
Are the others lying in wait?

00:14:09.966 --> 00:14:11.703
No, doesn't seem like it.

00:14:11.736 --> 00:14:15.309
Is he insane,
or just an idiot?

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:19.919
Popp [thought]:
Here goes nothing.

00:14:19.953 --> 00:14:22.190
Galdandy, watch yourself.

00:14:22.223 --> 00:14:25.130
He can cast spells
stronger than you'd expect.

00:14:25.163 --> 00:14:27.634
Ha! That scrawny wimp?

00:14:29.872 --> 00:14:31.074
Donk!

00:14:39.658 --> 00:14:41.530
Be crushed...

00:14:41.563 --> 00:14:44.234
C'mon...
Please be crushed!

00:14:50.112 --> 00:14:51.816
Galdandy: Thanks
for lifting me up.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:53.654
You're a real help, Ruud.

00:14:53.687 --> 00:14:56.626
Popp [thought]: Dammit!
That one slipped out the top!

00:15:05.443 --> 00:15:07.347
Such feeble Dragons.

00:15:07.381 --> 00:15:08.482
Borahorn: Pathetic.

00:15:09.485 --> 00:15:12.223
Baran: You're brave to
try and stop us alone.

00:15:13.459 --> 00:15:16.666
Master, why don't you
leave this one to us.

00:15:16.699 --> 00:15:18.402
We will catch
up with you later.

00:15:18.436 --> 00:15:21.208
You should hurry
ahead and find Dino.

00:15:21.242 --> 00:15:24.849
Very well, then. I will
leave this fight to you.

00:15:24.882 --> 00:15:27.622
Baran: But don't
underestimate him.

00:15:27.655 --> 00:15:29.224
As I said before,

00:15:29.258 --> 00:15:34.969
humans who are prepared to die
can display terrifying strength.

00:15:35.002 --> 00:15:37.240
You never know what
the desperate will do.

00:15:37.274 --> 00:15:39.913
"A cornered rat
will bite the cat."

00:15:39.946 --> 00:15:42.584
Isn't that what the
humans like to say?

00:15:43.553 --> 00:15:45.256
I guess you'll find out.

00:15:46.692 --> 00:15:47.995
Get back here!

00:15:50.634 --> 00:15:51.401
[startled yelp]

00:15:52.403 --> 00:15:53.105
[pained grunt]

00:15:53.139 --> 00:15:55.276
Borahorn: Know
your place, boy.

00:15:55.309 --> 00:15:58.750
A pipsqueak like you
couldn't beat Master Baran

00:15:58.784 --> 00:16:00.453
in a million years.

00:16:00.487 --> 00:16:03.091
Wanna bet? Kafrizz!

00:16:08.102 --> 00:16:10.507
With one single breath, huh?

00:16:10.541 --> 00:16:12.410
[laughing]

00:16:12.444 --> 00:16:15.717
I hope that's not all
you've got, little mage.

00:16:15.751 --> 00:16:19.024
You really thought you could
fight the Dragon Masters

00:16:19.057 --> 00:16:21.428
with spells like that?!

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.508
[flying yells]

00:16:27.541 --> 00:16:30.781
Come on. Are you
trying to make me laugh?

00:16:30.814 --> 00:16:33.485
[pained yells]

00:16:36.091 --> 00:16:37.962
You're too frail, boy.

00:16:37.995 --> 00:16:39.732
That's enough, Borahorn.

00:16:39.765 --> 00:16:41.101
What?

00:16:41.134 --> 00:16:43.707
He's nothing more
than a fledgling.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.578
We shouldn't make him suffer.

00:16:45.611 --> 00:16:48.516
Let's just get this
over with, alright?

00:16:50.453 --> 00:16:51.388
I guess.

00:16:51.421 --> 00:16:55.429
For a toy, he's not
very fun to play with.

00:17:10.426 --> 00:17:11.461
Galdandy?

00:17:11.495 --> 00:17:12.430
[laughing]

00:17:12.463 --> 00:17:14.935
I'd be happy to take
the boy off your hands

00:17:14.968 --> 00:17:17.274
if you two don't
want him anymore.

00:17:17.307 --> 00:17:19.679
He's juicy human prey.

00:17:19.712 --> 00:17:23.520
It's no fun unless we
take our time killing him!

00:17:23.553 --> 00:17:25.156
You're as cruel as ever.

00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:27.060
Popp [thought]:
They're strong...

00:17:27.093 --> 00:17:29.464
They're going to kill me...

00:17:30.534 --> 00:17:31.769
Alright...

00:17:31.803 --> 00:17:33.172
If I'm going to die,

00:17:33.205 --> 00:17:35.944
I have to at least
hit them once or twice!

00:17:35.978 --> 00:17:39.217
Otherwise, what's
the point of dying?

00:17:42.758 --> 00:17:46.431
Galdandy: Whoops. Whoops.
You give up already, kid?

00:17:46.464 --> 00:17:49.672
Popp: I-It hurts.
I'm done for.

00:17:50.039 --> 00:17:51.074
Please...

00:17:51.108 --> 00:17:53.947
Just let your dragon
end it, already!

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:54.849
[mocking chuckle]

00:17:54.882 --> 00:17:57.354
You weakling! Oh, well.

00:17:57.387 --> 00:18:00.125
Since you asked so nicely...

00:18:02.397 --> 00:18:03.566
Sizzle!

00:18:08.108 --> 00:18:09.344
[proud chuckle]

00:18:09.377 --> 00:18:12.183
I guess you can do
anything if you're desperate.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.655
The kid...

00:18:14.688 --> 00:18:17.928
He really downed Galdandy's
favorite Ethereal Serpent?

00:18:17.961 --> 00:18:20.499
Larhart: The rat
actually bit the cat.

00:18:20.534 --> 00:18:24.341
But his resistance is going
to come with a steep price.

00:18:24.374 --> 00:18:26.679
Popp [thought]: That takes
care of their Dragons.

00:18:26.713 --> 00:18:28.850
Now the real fight starts.

00:18:35.964 --> 00:18:36.866
This...

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.936
This is impossible!

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.575
Galdandy: How could
you die, Ruud?

00:18:44.047 --> 00:18:45.282
Popp [thought]:
Seriously?!

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.660
The cruelty! It's too much!

00:18:50.694 --> 00:18:54.167
[sobbing]

00:18:54.201 --> 00:18:56.806
What are you crying
about, bird-face?!

00:18:56.839 --> 00:19:00.446
You're a monster! You've
destroyed entire kingdoms!

00:19:01.448 --> 00:19:04.655
Killed tons of humans
-so what?

00:19:04.689 --> 00:19:08.161
Galdandy: Ruud was
an Ethereal Serpent,

00:19:08.195 --> 00:19:12.605
and the only friend
I ever trusted.

00:19:12.638 --> 00:19:17.113
He was more-
he was my brother.

00:19:17.146 --> 00:19:21.656
We were always together,
no matter what...

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:24.294
How dare you compare
my beloved dragon

00:19:24.327 --> 00:19:26.799
to some filthy little humans!

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:30.272
What are these feathers?

00:19:31.643 --> 00:19:32.443
They won't come out.

00:19:32.477 --> 00:19:34.982
I'll slice you to pieces.

00:19:35.016 --> 00:19:38.322
So many they'll
never even find you.

00:19:38.356 --> 00:19:40.225
G-Get away from me!

00:19:41.896 --> 00:19:44.568
Popp [thought]: That's it!
They're all on the ground now.

00:19:46.773 --> 00:19:48.208
Donk!

00:19:50.881 --> 00:19:52.183
Why isn't it working?!

00:19:52.217 --> 00:19:55.389
Galdandy: You can't use
those spells of yours.

00:19:55.422 --> 00:19:59.732
I'm afraid what's left of your
Magic Power is leaking out.

00:19:59.765 --> 00:20:00.868
You mean...

00:20:00.901 --> 00:20:01.969
Galdandy: That's right.

00:20:02.002 --> 00:20:06.645
Those white feathers drain
an enemy's Magic Power.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.649
Get out!

00:20:08.683 --> 00:20:11.990
Oh, and these red feathers,
they'll drain your stamina.

00:20:12.023 --> 00:20:13.727
So, do you get it yet?

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.198
I'm going to reduce
you to an empty rag doll

00:20:16.231 --> 00:20:18.235
before I slice you up!

00:20:18.269 --> 00:20:20.907
I'll make you
fear for your life!

00:20:22.945 --> 00:20:24.681
Kafrizz!

00:20:25.751 --> 00:20:27.419
All right, Frizzle!

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:30.193
Galdandy: Don't resist!

00:20:30.226 --> 00:20:31.796
[pained cry]

00:20:36.371 --> 00:20:39.343
Popp [thought]: It's
no use. I feel weak...

00:20:40.279 --> 00:20:42.885
I won't let you die so easy.

00:20:42.918 --> 00:20:45.022
I'm dragging this out!

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.431
Galdandy: Take
this, and this!

00:20:49.464 --> 00:20:51.602
Does it hurt? I bet it does!

00:20:51.635 --> 00:20:52.804
He's gone mad.

00:20:52.838 --> 00:20:56.145
Even if we tried to intervene,
we couldn't stop him now.

00:20:56.178 --> 00:20:57.446
The boy had a choice.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.252
He could've died painlessly
if he hadn't resisted.

00:21:00.286 --> 00:21:02.056
Poor kid is a mess.

00:21:05.062 --> 00:21:09.338
You're tougher than I thought,
and it's making me angry!

00:21:09.371 --> 00:21:10.874
Popp [thought]:
I've got to fight back...

00:21:10.908 --> 00:21:13.847
While I still have some
stamina and Magic Power,

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.586
I have to do something!

00:21:16.619 --> 00:21:20.092
O-Oh! I like that
face right there.

00:21:20.126 --> 00:21:21.896
I know. How about...

00:21:21.929 --> 00:21:24.334
I do what you did to Ruud...

00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:26.171
And take off your head!

00:21:26.205 --> 00:21:27.508
[cackling]

00:21:27.541 --> 00:21:29.444
That's it. That's the look!

00:21:29.477 --> 00:21:31.715
Just keep that expression...

00:21:42.538 --> 00:21:44.307
Larhart: Who's there?

00:21:52.056 --> 00:21:54.327
Well, that is just great.

00:21:54.361 --> 00:21:58.268
I'm saved by the last
guy I want saving me.

00:21:58.301 --> 00:22:00.840
Sorry to disappoint you, Popp.

00:23:37.734 --> 00:23:39.303
Narrator: Despite
their differences,

00:23:39.337 --> 00:23:40.674
Popp can't deny
that Hyunckel is

00:23:40.707 --> 00:23:43.212
the best possible
ally on the battlefield,

00:23:43.245 --> 00:23:44.715
and soon the pair
gain the advantage

00:23:44.748 --> 00:23:47.353
over Galdandy and Borahorn.

00:23:47.386 --> 00:23:48.957
But when Popp's
Magic Power fails

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:51.529
and Larhart raises
his ominous spear,

00:23:51.562 --> 00:23:53.499
a ferocious battle
unfolds between

00:23:53.533 --> 00:23:56.605
Hyunckel and the
last Dragon Master...

00:23:56.639 --> 00:23:58.375
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:58.408 --> 00:24:00.647
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.851
"Land Rider Larhart".
