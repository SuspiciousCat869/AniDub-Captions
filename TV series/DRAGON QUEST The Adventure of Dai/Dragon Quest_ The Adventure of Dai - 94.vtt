WEBVTT

00:01:50.722 --> 00:01:51.790
Avan: Just as Dai, the Hero,

00:01:51.824 --> 00:01:54.462
is the only one who can
defeat the Dark King...

00:01:54.495 --> 00:01:56.767
there's only one person
who can help him

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.270
unlock his full potential...

00:01:58.303 --> 00:02:00.174
and that person is
the one who's been...

00:02:00.207 --> 00:02:02.912
fighting by his side ever
since the beginning.

00:02:02.945 --> 00:02:04.248
Th-That's you.

00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:05.718
I-It's always been you, Popp.

00:02:09.526 --> 00:02:11.797
Remember to work together...

00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:13.600
and win this thing.

00:02:15.738 --> 00:02:18.343
All: Master!

00:02:29.132 --> 00:02:31.002
Master...

00:02:31.035 --> 00:02:32.906
I hope you can see us...

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:34.777
Because, no matter
what it takes...

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:35.978
We'll get the Dark King.

00:02:36.011 --> 00:02:38.249
I promise we
won't let you down.

00:02:39.118 --> 00:02:41.455
A promise you can't keep.

00:02:42.692 --> 00:02:44.228
What do you think
you're doing?

00:02:44.262 --> 00:02:46.265
Vearn's about to use
that attack again!

00:02:46.298 --> 00:02:48.236
Hurry up and ready yourselves!

00:02:49.005 --> 00:02:50.809
No need.

00:02:50.842 --> 00:02:51.943
Don't worry, guys.

00:02:54.382 --> 00:02:56.753
No way Vearn will start off
with his biggest move.

00:02:56.787 --> 00:03:00.628
That's not how the Demonic Guard
of Heaven and Earth works.

00:03:00.662 --> 00:03:03.166
You see, it's not
that kind of skill.

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.805
I understand now.

00:03:05.838 --> 00:03:08.844
It's the ultimate stance for
defense, but not offense.

00:03:08.878 --> 00:03:11.884
It only works as well as
it does when countering.

00:03:11.917 --> 00:03:15.089
Popp: It might let him use three
different skills at once...

00:03:15.123 --> 00:03:16.927
But if he uses
it to strike first,

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.397
it's really just
a triple attack...

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.699
and there's four of us.

00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:21.670
Besides, why would
he waste the energy?

00:03:21.703 --> 00:03:23.808
His other skills are
already fearsome enough

00:03:23.841 --> 00:03:25.410
to defeat most enemies.

00:03:25.443 --> 00:03:27.281
He said it takes
all his strength.

00:03:27.314 --> 00:03:28.517
I'll bet Vearn only uses

00:03:28.551 --> 00:03:30.253
the Demonic Guard
of Heaven and Earth

00:03:30.287 --> 00:03:32.491
when he doesn't have
any other choice.

00:03:33.894 --> 00:03:35.364
Facing a truly powerful enemy,

00:03:35.397 --> 00:03:37.569
I figure he lets
them make the first move.

00:03:37.602 --> 00:03:39.472
That gives him a
chance to hit them

00:03:39.506 --> 00:03:42.244
with his superior skills of
attack, defense, and magic...

00:03:42.277 --> 00:03:44.315
completely obliterating them.

00:03:44.348 --> 00:03:46.820
It's an unbeatable
combination.

00:03:47.656 --> 00:03:49.492
Popp: Only, if what
he said is true,

00:03:49.526 --> 00:03:52.164
it means he has to charge
a massive amount of energy

00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:53.534
before he can unleash it.

00:03:53.568 --> 00:03:55.270
These aren't
your average attacks,

00:03:55.303 --> 00:03:56.439
they're on a different level.

00:03:56.473 --> 00:03:58.243
Hitting his opponent
with all three...

00:03:58.276 --> 00:04:00.748
that must be what
causes such destruction.

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:03.019
And I'm guessing that
this immovable stance

00:04:03.052 --> 00:04:06.091
isn't just to make his
enemies attack first, either.

00:04:06.125 --> 00:04:08.463
It probably lets him
conserve energy,

00:04:08.496 --> 00:04:10.901
storing everything
he's got in his core,

00:04:10.935 --> 00:04:13.306
then unleashing
it all at once.

00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:17.181
Well, how insightful...
Avan's parting words

00:04:17.214 --> 00:04:20.755
weren't said out of
desperation, after all.

00:04:20.788 --> 00:04:23.059
True Vearn: I'm impressed
that a fledgling like you

00:04:23.092 --> 00:04:25.564
could comprehend
my ultimate skill.

00:04:26.734 --> 00:04:29.038
True Vearn: But,
knowing that, I wonder...

00:04:29.071 --> 00:04:30.675
What can you do?

00:04:30.708 --> 00:04:33.012
How exactly do you
intend to fight?

00:04:33.045 --> 00:04:34.783
Once I take this
stance, it's over.

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:37.254
No one among you has
the mettle to break it.

00:04:37.287 --> 00:04:40.327
And at this point,
buying time is meaningless.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.465
Dai's wounds were
inflicted by Dark Aura.

00:04:42.498 --> 00:04:43.634
So try what you might,

00:04:43.667 --> 00:04:46.272
your healing spells
will have no effect.

00:04:46.305 --> 00:04:47.407
Popp [thought]: He's right.

00:04:47.441 --> 00:04:49.278
Dai's not healing at all,

00:04:49.311 --> 00:04:51.482
so if that's not
changing anytime soon...

00:04:51.517 --> 00:04:52.953
Then it's up to me.

00:04:52.986 --> 00:04:53.954
It'll take some luck,

00:04:53.988 --> 00:04:56.226
but I think I have one
way of taking him down.

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:58.096
We need to hit him in
that split second

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:00.602
where he's open after
launching one of his attacks...

00:05:00.635 --> 00:05:03.440
Right before he charges
into the next one.

00:05:03.473 --> 00:05:06.680
Popp [thought]: But with
everybody in such rough shape...

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.375
I also never said
I couldn't initiate

00:05:21.408 --> 00:05:23.914
a different attack
in the meantime.

00:05:23.947 --> 00:05:26.386
It would have been wise
not to forget that.

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:27.556
He dropped his stance!

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:28.524
Larhart: Here he comes!

00:05:28.557 --> 00:05:30.060
Larhart, Hym? Listen up.

00:05:30.093 --> 00:05:31.764
I know this is a lot to ask,

00:05:31.797 --> 00:05:34.468
considering how we barely
know each other, but I...

00:05:34.503 --> 00:05:37.007
I'm gonna need you
both... to get hit.

00:05:39.913 --> 00:05:40.848
[pained howl]

00:05:53.974 --> 00:05:56.245
I can see why humans
of the ancient world

00:05:56.278 --> 00:05:57.849
believed that thunder
was the sound of

00:05:57.883 --> 00:05:59.786
the gods fighting in
the heavens above.

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:03.225
Gods or not, you can feel their
power all the way down here.

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:05.230
I've never seen
anything like this.

00:06:05.263 --> 00:06:06.967
Dai and the others
must be fighting

00:06:07.001 --> 00:06:08.604
the Dark King as we speak.

00:06:08.637 --> 00:06:10.842
Lon Beruk: With such
astonishing energy...

00:06:10.875 --> 00:06:13.480
There's no ifs, ands,
or buts about it:

00:06:13.514 --> 00:06:15.483
Either the Dark King falls,

00:06:15.518 --> 00:06:18.023
or the Surface World
comes to an end.

00:06:18.056 --> 00:06:20.059
It's one or the other.

00:06:22.565 --> 00:06:24.134
Hyunckel: They're
no match for him.

00:06:25.403 --> 00:06:27.140
Crocodine: Vearn's
on another level.

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:32.652
Leona: No...
Please... Stop...

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:35.525
[evil laughter]

00:06:35.558 --> 00:06:37.427
Your friends are losing
their faith in you.

00:06:37.461 --> 00:06:40.000
If only you could hear
their cries of anguish, Dai.

00:06:40.033 --> 00:06:41.468
It's lovely.

00:06:42.672 --> 00:06:44.208
True Vearn: They were so certain
they could help you win...

00:06:44.242 --> 00:06:48.518
yet in the end, they made the
same mistake as the Princess.

00:06:48.551 --> 00:06:50.187
And now, gentlemen...

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.658
This game is mine.

00:06:53.393 --> 00:06:54.562
No, c'mon...

00:06:54.596 --> 00:06:58.002
Popp: It's no use. I can
barely even move here...

00:06:58.035 --> 00:07:00.574
Actually, make that
"I can't move at all."

00:07:00.608 --> 00:07:02.512
Was this all for nothing?

00:07:02.546 --> 00:07:03.747
Larhart: Y-You asked us...

00:07:03.781 --> 00:07:06.185
To... To give
our lives to you...

00:07:06.218 --> 00:07:08.256
So tell us.
What should we do?

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.295
If there's any hope of winning,
we'll give whatever it takes...

00:07:11.328 --> 00:07:12.599
Just say the word.

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:13.967
We can't hold out much longer.

00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:17.307
If you can't hold out,
then there's no hope at all.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.411
My plan wasn't anything
complicated...

00:07:19.445 --> 00:07:21.449
it was just the opposite.

00:07:21.482 --> 00:07:24.121
I was thinking about
what you said earlier...

00:07:24.154 --> 00:07:26.893
About being a shield for Dai.

00:07:26.927 --> 00:07:29.833
We've already taken a pretty
serious beating here...

00:07:29.867 --> 00:07:33.339
In this state, none of us will
be able to face Vearn directly.

00:07:33.373 --> 00:07:34.709
And that was why...

00:07:34.742 --> 00:07:37.949
I wanted us to absorb his
blows and create an opening.

00:07:37.982 --> 00:07:39.619
If we could manage that,

00:07:39.652 --> 00:07:42.491
Dai could focus on the
offensive and knock him dead.

00:07:42.525 --> 00:07:43.728
What do you mean, "Wanted"?

00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:45.631
Y-You're talking past tense?

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:47.635
It looks like I
underestimated him.

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:48.837
Vearn's hitting so hard...

00:07:48.871 --> 00:07:51.476
I'm not sure if we can
even take one more round

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.645
without it destroying us...

00:07:52.678 --> 00:07:54.649
P-Popp... I can't-

00:07:58.155 --> 00:08:00.193
I've wasted quite enough time.

00:08:00.226 --> 00:08:01.530
Now, I shall end this farce...

00:08:01.563 --> 00:08:04.168
and wipe you all out
with my Calamitous Wall.

00:08:04.201 --> 00:08:05.303
[chuckling]

00:08:05.336 --> 00:08:06.606
Oh, by the way,

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.443
it's likely that some of
these poor little Eye Jewels

00:08:08.476 --> 00:08:10.714
will be disintegrated
along with you.

00:08:13.788 --> 00:08:16.192
He means me, doesn't he?!

00:08:16.225 --> 00:08:19.565
But not to worry. I'll make sure
that this one moves slowly.

00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:23.039
That way, you may savor your
fear for all it's worth.

00:08:23.072 --> 00:08:24.942
Calamitous Wall!

00:08:31.824 --> 00:08:38.002
True Vearn: [evil cackle]

00:08:38.035 --> 00:08:39.238
Not a chance!

00:08:39.271 --> 00:08:41.576
I'm not going down
as some joke.

00:08:42.745 --> 00:08:44.549
I'm not giving up.

00:08:44.582 --> 00:08:47.053
No matter what
he throws at us...

00:08:47.087 --> 00:08:48.924
I'll never give up!

00:08:49.759 --> 00:08:51.495
I swear it. I'm not sure how,

00:08:51.529 --> 00:08:53.968
but I'll survive this
Calamitous Wall.

00:08:54.001 --> 00:08:58.109
If we can't withstand this, Dai
will never get his moment...

00:08:58.142 --> 00:08:59.045
That means...

00:08:59.078 --> 00:09:00.715
I'll have to do
something big to get Vearn

00:09:00.748 --> 00:09:03.186
to use his ultimate
skill one more time!

00:09:03.219 --> 00:09:04.154
What are you saying?!

00:09:04.187 --> 00:09:05.123
Don't be a fool.

00:09:05.156 --> 00:09:07.394
Didn't you see the three
of us fail just now?

00:09:07.427 --> 00:09:09.498
How do you expect
to take this on alone?

00:09:09.532 --> 00:09:11.236
Popp: I'm still
working that part out.

00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:12.538
What I know for sure is,

00:09:12.572 --> 00:09:14.275
the Demonic Guard
of Heaven and Earth

00:09:14.308 --> 00:09:15.611
can't be beaten head-on.

00:09:15.644 --> 00:09:16.913
But I'm sure...

00:09:16.947 --> 00:09:19.351
the moment he unleashes that
ultimate skill of his...

00:09:19.385 --> 00:09:22.858
is also the moment he's
most vulnerable to attacks!

00:09:22.892 --> 00:09:23.794
Good call.

00:09:23.828 --> 00:09:26.065
You had the same
idea that I did.

00:09:26.098 --> 00:09:28.504
The way I see it, it's
the only option we've got.

00:09:28.537 --> 00:09:31.543
First we have to withstand all
three of his super attacks,

00:09:31.576 --> 00:09:32.444
then right after that,

00:09:32.477 --> 00:09:34.314
we hit him as hard as we can.

00:09:34.347 --> 00:09:35.717
Perfect timing.

00:09:35.751 --> 00:09:39.291
It's a long shot, but that's
the only way to defeat him.

00:09:39.324 --> 00:09:41.129
Except, I couldn't do it alone.

00:09:41.162 --> 00:09:43.734
I knew if I tried,
it'd probably kill me.

00:09:43.768 --> 00:09:45.971
Great minds really do
think alike, don't they?

00:09:46.005 --> 00:09:49.077
Nice going, partner. If you
ask me, that settles it.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:52.117
We've got our plan, and
you're not alone anymore.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.422
You've got allies here
who are willing to suffer

00:09:54.455 --> 00:09:56.158
those super attacks for you.

00:09:56.192 --> 00:09:57.360
We'll get him open.

00:09:57.394 --> 00:09:59.765
Even if it means getting hit
by all three of them myself,

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:02.471
I'll make sure you get
your window to strike back.

00:10:02.505 --> 00:10:04.642
Hym [thought]: Wait...
He's serious.

00:10:04.676 --> 00:10:06.846
These guys are
out of their minds.

00:10:10.286 --> 00:10:12.958
It's an impossibility
within an impossibility...

00:10:12.992 --> 00:10:15.463
And that's all assuming
we can get him to use

00:10:15.497 --> 00:10:17.234
his ultimate skill again.

00:10:17.267 --> 00:10:18.302
Before we get started,

00:10:18.336 --> 00:10:20.540
we'd better take care of
the problem at hand...

00:10:20.574 --> 00:10:22.043
It's still a gamble
whether or not

00:10:22.077 --> 00:10:24.181
the Dark King will
actually take his stance.

00:10:24.214 --> 00:10:27.220
Let's roll the dice -
it's now or never!

00:10:28.824 --> 00:10:30.861
Chiu: Wait! Stay back!

00:10:39.144 --> 00:10:40.447
Chiu: Little Hym!

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.783
Hym: Sounds fun, Popp.

00:10:41.816 --> 00:10:44.488
You can count me in for a
hopeless gamble like that.

00:10:44.522 --> 00:10:45.991
I wouldn't miss it...

00:10:46.024 --> 00:10:47.260
Though, sadly,

00:10:47.294 --> 00:10:49.699
I don't think I'll be able to
stick around to see how it ends.

00:10:49.733 --> 00:10:51.235
Hym, wait!

00:10:52.437 --> 00:10:53.573
Larhart: You've
gained my respect

00:10:53.607 --> 00:10:55.544
for the first time, Pawn.

00:10:55.578 --> 00:10:57.247
Larhart: But I won't
let you outdo me

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.821
when it comes to displays of
our loyalty to Master Dai!

00:11:01.857 --> 00:11:03.392
I can't see anymore...

00:11:03.425 --> 00:11:05.297
Tell me, which way is Vearn?!

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:06.667
Hym: This way, Larhart.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.570
Come on!

00:11:08.604 --> 00:11:17.153
[roaring]

00:11:20.661 --> 00:11:24.769
[roaring]

00:11:36.893 --> 00:11:38.463
Popp, you can have my life.

00:11:38.496 --> 00:11:39.965
Mine too. Make it count!

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:41.737
Larhart, Hym!
You don't have to -

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:43.974
This is it. They're
really going for it.

00:12:03.947 --> 00:12:06.118
Hym [thought]: Even at full
strength, I couldn't touch him.

00:12:06.152 --> 00:12:09.257
I doubt any attack I can
muster will do much better.

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:10.293
In that case...

00:12:10.326 --> 00:12:12.097
Larhart [thought]:
We'll be living bullets.

00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:15.203
Just as long as he
takes that stance...

00:12:15.236 --> 00:12:18.108
True Vearn: These two are
truly prepared to die.

00:12:19.846 --> 00:12:22.551
True Vearn [thought]:
Such admirable intensity...

00:12:22.585 --> 00:12:24.722
True Vearn [thought]: No simple
attack can counter them...

00:12:24.756 --> 00:12:26.191
So be it.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:35.309
Demonic Guard of
Heaven and Earth!

00:12:50.774 --> 00:12:53.045
True Vearn: W-What? No -

00:12:53.078 --> 00:12:54.849
True Vearn [thought]: Medroa?!

00:13:02.464 --> 00:13:04.134
True Vearn: Phoenix... Wing!

00:13:12.752 --> 00:13:15.958
[laughing]

00:13:15.991 --> 00:13:18.396
Well done. You caught
me by surprise.

00:13:18.429 --> 00:13:19.397
Impressive.

00:13:19.431 --> 00:13:21.135
Not only did you manage
to orchestrate an attack

00:13:21.168 --> 00:13:23.472
which forced me to take
this stance again,

00:13:23.507 --> 00:13:26.312
but by using a delayed
Medroa incantation...

00:13:26.345 --> 00:13:30.086
You actually backed me
into a corner there.

00:13:30.119 --> 00:13:32.090
But, unfortunately for you...

00:13:32.123 --> 00:13:33.760
now that you've
revealed your ace,

00:13:33.793 --> 00:13:35.530
you've expended your options.

00:13:38.803 --> 00:13:39.973
True Vearn [thought]:
What is this?

00:13:40.006 --> 00:13:42.377
I... I can't drop my stance...

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:45.450
Something inside of me
must still sense a threat!

00:13:45.483 --> 00:13:48.155
Could it be? Do they still...

00:13:54.034 --> 00:13:57.341
Popp [thought]: Larhart,
Hym, we really owe you one.

00:13:57.374 --> 00:13:59.244
Even though we used
to be your enemies,

00:13:59.278 --> 00:14:02.316
both of you have put so
much on the line for us.

00:14:03.086 --> 00:14:04.221
Popp [thought]:
Thanks to you,

00:14:04.255 --> 00:14:06.458
we might even have
a chance at victory!

00:14:06.492 --> 00:14:08.797
Dai [thought]: We won't
let this go to waste.

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:12.905
This is your final
attack, is it?

00:14:12.938 --> 00:14:16.012
All right, then.
Go ahead and try.

00:14:16.045 --> 00:14:19.653
Popp: You might regret it...
Mister Dark King!

00:14:19.686 --> 00:14:21.321
And how do you figure that?

00:14:21.354 --> 00:14:23.292
Do I have to spell
it out for you?

00:14:23.326 --> 00:14:26.064
This last attack we have...
is gonna smash through

00:14:26.098 --> 00:14:27.835
your Demonic Guard
of Heaven and Earth,

00:14:27.868 --> 00:14:30.072
and blast you back
to the Underworld!

00:14:30.675 --> 00:14:32.143
Don't make me laugh.

00:14:32.177 --> 00:14:34.114
Whether it's Gigastrash
or Medroa...

00:14:34.147 --> 00:14:36.151
By now, you should know
that even your most

00:14:36.184 --> 00:14:39.057
powerful attacks
are useless against me.

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:41.161
You really don't
get it, do you Vearn?

00:14:41.194 --> 00:14:42.731
We haven't made our move yet.

00:14:42.764 --> 00:14:45.871
Popp wasn't trying to defeat
you when he cast Medroa...

00:14:45.904 --> 00:14:47.875
He did it so we could
make sure our plan

00:14:47.908 --> 00:14:49.444
was actually gonna work.

00:14:49.478 --> 00:14:50.313
Oh?

00:14:50.346 --> 00:14:51.983
Popp: And it's exactly
like I thought.

00:14:52.017 --> 00:14:54.522
Right after you use that
fancy stance of yours,

00:14:54.555 --> 00:14:55.825
there's a slight delay before

00:14:55.858 --> 00:14:57.962
you're ready to counter
another attack...

00:14:57.995 --> 00:15:00.300
A split second when
you're not invincible.

00:15:00.333 --> 00:15:03.205
I cast that Medroa so Dai
and I could see how to get

00:15:03.239 --> 00:15:06.478
the timing just right with
what we're really going to do.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.117
Now we know I was right.

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.188
We've seen you freeze
for ourselves.

00:15:11.221 --> 00:15:14.027
On top of that, you must've
burned through so much power,

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.566
you couldn't properly deflect
the Medroa back at me...

00:15:16.599 --> 00:15:20.473
Even Mystvearn managed to
do that without trying.

00:15:20.508 --> 00:15:23.212
All to say, if we strike
at that exact moment...

00:15:23.245 --> 00:15:25.249
We might barely be
able to stand,

00:15:25.282 --> 00:15:28.088
but we've still got a chance
at turning this fight around.

00:15:28.122 --> 00:15:29.992
An interesting idea.

00:15:30.026 --> 00:15:32.230
Yes, I see. Perhaps
you are correct.

00:15:32.263 --> 00:15:34.234
That explains why
I can't drop my stance.

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:36.104
I'm not surprised
you didn't know.

00:15:36.137 --> 00:15:39.244
After all, this skill that
you believe so deeply in has

00:15:39.278 --> 00:15:42.050
never failed to beat an
opponent before, has it?

00:15:42.084 --> 00:15:43.486
Of course it hasn't.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:47.060
The Demonic Guard of Heaven and
Earth is my ultimate skill.

00:15:47.094 --> 00:15:49.699
To use it means to
absolutely erase my enemy.

00:15:49.732 --> 00:15:51.101
None of them survive.

00:15:51.135 --> 00:15:53.807
None of them may have found
your weakness - but we did.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.878
Every great skill
comes at a price -

00:15:55.911 --> 00:15:58.983
and in your case,
it's that opening.

00:15:59.017 --> 00:16:01.857
I mean... It is a pretty
good skill, but really?

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:03.191
Showing it off so many times

00:16:03.225 --> 00:16:04.962
when you don't know
it's weak point.

00:16:04.995 --> 00:16:06.365
If you wanted to
secure a victory,

00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:08.002
you should've kept
it simple and stuck

00:16:08.035 --> 00:16:09.773
with some standard attacks...

00:16:09.806 --> 00:16:11.509
Nice thinking, doofus.

00:16:12.945 --> 00:16:14.883
Avan [thought]:
This is a gamble indeed.

00:16:14.916 --> 00:16:17.120
With their stamina
drained, having Vearn

00:16:17.153 --> 00:16:19.692
go back to attacking
normally might be worse.

00:16:19.725 --> 00:16:21.796
He could overpower
them instantly.

00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:24.635
Popp must be deliberately
testing Vearn's patience...

00:16:24.668 --> 00:16:27.173
Trying to provoke him into
taking the stance again.

00:16:27.206 --> 00:16:29.311
He's betting everything
on the Dark King

00:16:29.344 --> 00:16:31.849
having absolute confidence
in that ability.

00:16:31.882 --> 00:16:33.252
Very well, then.

00:16:34.287 --> 00:16:36.291
My invitation still stands.

00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:40.868
Popp [thought]:
All right, here we go.

00:16:40.901 --> 00:16:42.437
It's all or nothing now.

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.210
I'm curious to see if that
little provocation of yours

00:16:45.243 --> 00:16:47.815
winds up paying off
as well as you hope.

00:16:47.848 --> 00:16:51.055
I never imagined that I could
possess such a weakness.

00:16:51.088 --> 00:16:53.560
It's almost exciting,
to tell the truth.

00:16:53.593 --> 00:16:55.095
But first...

00:17:00.841 --> 00:17:03.179
True Vearn: And then
there were two.

00:17:03.212 --> 00:17:05.149
Avan [thought]: Dai... Popp...

00:17:05.182 --> 00:17:06.485
Hyunckel [thought]:
This is looking grim.

00:17:06.519 --> 00:17:07.988
I don't know what
they're planning,

00:17:08.021 --> 00:17:09.491
but these two are
far too wounded

00:17:09.525 --> 00:17:11.562
to break through
Vearn's ultimate skill...

00:17:11.596 --> 00:17:14.067
There's no one out
there to heal them.

00:17:14.101 --> 00:17:15.504
Crocodine [thought]: Damnit!
This infernal cage...

00:17:15.537 --> 00:17:18.375
I can't even be a shield for
them when they need me the most.

00:17:18.409 --> 00:17:20.079
It seems Dai doesn't
have the stamina

00:17:20.113 --> 00:17:21.649
to use Gigastrash anymore,

00:17:21.682 --> 00:17:24.120
which means that option
is off the table...

00:17:24.153 --> 00:17:25.456
And if you're
planning to bring

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:27.561
an end to this with
another Medroa,

00:17:27.594 --> 00:17:30.266
There's no reason why I
wouldn't be able to deflect it.

00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:32.404
Neither attack can be
used to finish me.

00:17:32.437 --> 00:17:35.143
You're completely
out of moves here.

00:17:35.176 --> 00:17:36.913
That's exactly
why I'm so intrigued.

00:17:36.946 --> 00:17:38.583
There's no way that
the two of you could

00:17:38.616 --> 00:17:40.787
possibly accomplish
this plan by yourselves.

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.592
Especially not in
your condition.

00:17:42.625 --> 00:17:44.695
Like you say, you're
barely on your feet.

00:17:44.728 --> 00:17:47.267
You won't be able to
withstand another blow.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.872
So how exactly do you
intend to hit me?

00:17:49.905 --> 00:17:51.509
Who will make
the deciding move?

00:17:51.543 --> 00:17:53.145
This I have to see.

00:17:53.179 --> 00:17:55.551
Popp: "Which of us will
make the deciding move"?

00:17:55.584 --> 00:17:57.119
Isn't it obvious?

00:17:57.153 --> 00:17:59.926
It's always the Hero who
defeats the Dark King!

00:17:59.959 --> 00:18:02.263
Everybody knows that.

00:18:02.297 --> 00:18:03.967
I'm the one who
plays the shield

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.870
against your ultimate skill!

00:18:06.773 --> 00:18:08.008
Maam [thought]: Popp...

00:18:08.042 --> 00:18:09.144
Popp [thought]: I did it!

00:18:09.177 --> 00:18:11.148
I remembered when I
saw Mentor conjuring

00:18:11.181 --> 00:18:13.352
two spells at once
way back when.

00:18:13.386 --> 00:18:14.689
I thought maybe
I could swing

00:18:14.722 --> 00:18:16.993
the same thing now, and...
It's working.

00:18:17.027 --> 00:18:19.766
[laughing]

00:18:19.799 --> 00:18:22.136
You're an incredibly
talented Mage, young man.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:23.306
With all that Magic Power,

00:18:23.339 --> 00:18:25.644
this may be better than
a single Medroa...

00:18:25.677 --> 00:18:26.813
but given your talents,

00:18:26.846 --> 00:18:29.217
I thought you'd be a
little brighter than this.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.656
Do you not know
how to do simple math?

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:32.825
W-What do you mean?

00:18:32.858 --> 00:18:35.129
True Vearn: Let's assume
that Explosion-type spell

00:18:35.162 --> 00:18:37.802
you're holding is as
strong as a Kaboom spell...

00:18:37.835 --> 00:18:40.874
And that you can also deal a
considerable amount of damage

00:18:40.907 --> 00:18:44.615
with your remaining Magic Power
focused into that staff.

00:18:44.649 --> 00:18:46.084
That adds up to two.

00:18:46.117 --> 00:18:48.288
So what will you do
with my third attack?

00:18:48.322 --> 00:18:50.594
If a frail human like
you takes a direct hit

00:18:50.627 --> 00:18:53.032
without any magical
safeguards in place,

00:18:53.065 --> 00:18:55.537
you'll be dust before
you become a shield.

00:18:56.773 --> 00:18:58.676
True Vearn: First,
I'll use my Phoenix Wing

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:01.448
to deflect your spell by
swallowing it whole...

00:19:01.481 --> 00:19:05.056
Then, I'll shatter your
weapon with my Calamitous End.

00:19:05.089 --> 00:19:07.227
At that point,
you'll be defenseless.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.428
To finish the job,

00:19:08.462 --> 00:19:10.466
I'll hit you with the
combined force of your

00:19:10.499 --> 00:19:13.773
deflected spell
and my Kaiser Phoenix.

00:19:16.344 --> 00:19:18.249
True Vearn: You'll be
incinerated in an instant,

00:19:18.282 --> 00:19:19.952
and then my
spell will hit Dai

00:19:19.985 --> 00:19:22.223
before he can exploit
any weakness.

00:19:22.256 --> 00:19:24.795
You'll both be
reduced to ashes.

00:19:24.829 --> 00:19:26.833
That's how this will end.

00:19:26.866 --> 00:19:27.968
[chuckling]

00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:28.937
What a shame.

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:30.272
If only you had
a few more people,

00:19:30.306 --> 00:19:31.776
things might be
very different.

00:19:33.412 --> 00:19:35.951
Here it comes - Vearn!

00:19:35.984 --> 00:19:39.257
You're doomed and yet...
you still try.

00:19:40.325 --> 00:19:41.562
Dai: Vearn...

00:19:41.595 --> 00:19:43.332
Popp might've been a little
unreliable at first,

00:19:43.366 --> 00:19:44.935
but now he's anything but.

00:19:44.968 --> 00:19:47.908
He's fought by my side
since the very beginning.

00:19:47.941 --> 00:19:49.545
We've been through
it all together.

00:19:50.647 --> 00:19:52.718
Dai: He's a friend
I trust with my life.

00:19:52.752 --> 00:19:55.490
He's definitely saved it
enough, that's for sure.

00:19:55.524 --> 00:19:58.329
Point is, if Popp says
he'll make an opening for me,

00:19:58.362 --> 00:19:59.599
then he'll make an opening.

00:19:59.632 --> 00:20:01.669
All I have to do is
trust him and focus

00:20:01.702 --> 00:20:03.840
whatever's left of
my power on you.

00:20:05.309 --> 00:20:06.946
And you'd better
remember this:

00:20:06.979 --> 00:20:08.282
Even if it looks like it...

00:20:08.315 --> 00:20:10.887
the two of us aren't
fighting you alone...

00:20:10.921 --> 00:20:14.027
We might've been, back when we
first started this adventure,

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.329
but along the way,

00:20:15.363 --> 00:20:17.333
we've met all kinds of
people who are on our side.

00:20:17.367 --> 00:20:18.770
A few of them
have fought us,

00:20:18.804 --> 00:20:21.075
and pretty much all of
them have rescued us...

00:20:21.108 --> 00:20:23.178
But if even one of them
hadn't been there,

00:20:23.212 --> 00:20:24.582
if they didn't
have our backs,

00:20:24.616 --> 00:20:26.652
I'm willing to bet
we wouldn't be here.

00:20:26.685 --> 00:20:28.857
Popp: Even if they're far
away from the battle...

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:32.096
Even if they can't speak
or move a muscle...

00:20:32.129 --> 00:20:33.800
They're all right by our side.

00:20:33.834 --> 00:20:36.739
We're all connected by
the bond of our souls.

00:20:38.676 --> 00:20:40.713
That's a bond
nobody can break.

00:20:40.747 --> 00:20:43.485
Maybe you can't see it, but
you'll feel it soon enough,

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.389
and I know it's
gonna surprise you!

00:20:45.422 --> 00:20:47.093
True Vearn: I've
already said it once.

00:20:47.126 --> 00:20:48.830
Must I really say it again?

00:20:48.864 --> 00:20:52.336
You cannot destroy
my existence with a soul!

00:20:52.971 --> 00:20:55.242
Here we go, Dai. Good luck.

00:20:55.275 --> 00:20:57.147
The rest is up to
you from here.

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.348
Right!

00:21:01.823 --> 00:21:03.358
[roaring]

00:21:05.129 --> 00:21:07.466
[roaring]

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:11.307
Demonic Guard of
Heaven... and Earth!

00:21:15.784 --> 00:21:17.988
[gasp]

00:21:26.237 --> 00:21:27.674
Leona: No! Popp!

00:21:27.707 --> 00:21:28.844
Crocodine [thought]:
It's no use.

00:21:28.877 --> 00:21:31.414
This is just as Vearn
said it would go.

00:21:31.448 --> 00:21:34.388
True Vearn: I told you,
didn't I? I was right!

00:21:34.421 --> 00:21:37.961
[victorious laughing]

00:21:41.067 --> 00:21:41.702
[gasp]

00:21:44.407 --> 00:21:46.245
True Vearn [thought]:
The Mirror of Shahal?!

00:21:46.278 --> 00:21:48.048
That's right, you big jerk.

00:21:48.081 --> 00:21:50.319
Reflect it!

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:56.431
[roaring]

00:23:37.266 --> 00:23:39.639
Narrator: Thanks to Larhart
and Hym's desperate charge,

00:23:39.672 --> 00:23:41.709
Popp and Dai have found
a way to slip past

00:23:41.742 --> 00:23:43.445
the Demonic Guard
of Heaven and Earth...

00:23:43.478 --> 00:23:44.915
And wielding the
Mirror of Shahal,

00:23:44.949 --> 00:23:46.920
Popp has also managed to
deflect Vearn's magic.

00:23:46.953 --> 00:23:49.323
As the Dark King's
own flames consume him,

00:23:49.356 --> 00:23:51.261
Dai spots his
moment to attack.

00:23:51.294 --> 00:23:52.463
The fate of the Surface World

00:23:52.497 --> 00:23:54.434
rests on our Hero's
next strike...

00:23:54.467 --> 00:23:56.471
but Vearn has another
surprise in store for him.

00:23:56.505 --> 00:23:58.342

00:23:58.375 --> 00:24:00.178
