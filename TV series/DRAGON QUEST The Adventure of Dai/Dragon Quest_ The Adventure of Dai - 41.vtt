WEBVTT

00:01:50.955 --> 00:01:52.158
I choose...

00:01:52.191 --> 00:01:54.596
the Light of Justice!

00:02:02.211 --> 00:02:04.214
Mystvearn: Where
did he learn that?!

00:02:04.248 --> 00:02:06.052
He broke through
Mystvearn's...

00:02:06.085 --> 00:02:07.722
Decimation Field?!

00:02:07.755 --> 00:02:08.658
That attack...

00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:11.463
It looked exactly
like Dai's Air Slash.

00:02:11.496 --> 00:02:12.665
W-What?!

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:14.569
It actually worked-

00:02:14.602 --> 00:02:18.010
I can wield the power of
a true warrior of justice.

00:02:18.043 --> 00:02:20.515
The Avan Spear Technique...

00:02:20.548 --> 00:02:22.084
The Air Strike.

00:02:22.117 --> 00:02:24.723
I must have been so
desperate to defeat him...

00:02:24.756 --> 00:02:26.927
to destroy him.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.830
That now...

00:02:27.863 --> 00:02:30.234
Justice is my weapon.

00:02:30.267 --> 00:02:31.504
You really did it,

00:02:31.537 --> 00:02:32.906
Hyunckel...

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.010
Avan would be so proud-

00:02:35.044 --> 00:02:36.680
His greatest skill!

00:02:36.714 --> 00:02:38.884
I couldn't have
done it without you,

00:02:38.918 --> 00:02:40.353
Dear Maam.

00:02:42.224 --> 00:02:45.197
Without you I would still
be on that evil path...

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.567
Into darkness.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.838
Where I would have been lost.

00:02:48.871 --> 00:02:50.273
Hyunckel...

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.346
Now, I swear...

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.183
From this day on...

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:56.988
I am the light.

00:02:57.021 --> 00:02:58.824
A warrior of justice...

00:02:58.858 --> 00:03:00.961
until I breathe
my last breath!

00:03:02.198 --> 00:03:04.135
Popp: Hey - we're
still stuck in this

00:03:04.168 --> 00:03:05.905
"Decimation Field", y'know?!

00:03:11.048 --> 00:03:12.752
Mystvearn: Curse you, Hyunckel!

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.278
He has a man's face?!

00:03:27.414 --> 00:03:28.684
Hyunckel: Mystvearn...

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.525
Mystvearn: You saw it.

00:03:35.363 --> 00:03:36.733
[furious roar]

00:03:37.267 --> 00:03:46.720
[pained cries]

00:03:46.754 --> 00:03:49.024
[snarling]

00:03:49.057 --> 00:03:51.128
[agonized cries]

00:03:51.162 --> 00:03:53.032
It hurts!

00:03:53.065 --> 00:03:56.172
Maam [thought]: His power
is even greater than before.

00:03:56.205 --> 00:04:00.949
[pained cries]

00:04:00.982 --> 00:04:02.853
Mystvearn: You filth!

00:04:02.886 --> 00:04:04.055
You dare...

00:04:04.088 --> 00:04:06.560
to reveal my face.

00:04:06.593 --> 00:04:11.670
A face that no one is
meant to gaze upon.

00:04:13.206 --> 00:04:15.243
Come on - seriously?!

00:04:15.276 --> 00:04:17.916
What's so bad about us
seeing what you look like?

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.018
Mystvearn: Silence!

00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:21.289
[agonized howl]

00:04:21.322 --> 00:04:22.425
[pained cries]

00:04:22.458 --> 00:04:23.694
Hyunckel [thought]:
He's in a frenzy...

00:04:23.727 --> 00:04:26.633
The cool and collected
Mystvearn of all people...

00:04:26.667 --> 00:04:29.839
How vital of a secret
could that face hold?

00:04:30.274 --> 00:04:31.242
Curses...

00:04:31.275 --> 00:04:33.514
If I can use
Air Strike again...

00:04:39.324 --> 00:04:42.298
The Aura of Justice isn't
working for me anymore.

00:04:42.331 --> 00:04:45.137
Mystvearn: Your abilities
are underdeveloped.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.678
What could you
possibly do to stop me?

00:04:48.711 --> 00:04:51.315
[pained cry]

00:04:51.348 --> 00:04:53.453
Mystvearn: The Dark
King Vearn demanded that

00:04:53.486 --> 00:04:56.158
the people of this
kingdom suffer-

00:04:56.192 --> 00:04:58.296
and there's nothing
you pitiful humans

00:04:58.329 --> 00:05:02.471
can do to stop me
from completing my task.

00:05:02.505 --> 00:05:03.406
Mystvearn: Cry...

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:04.341
[tortured scream]

00:05:04.375 --> 00:05:05.745
Mystvearn: Scream...

00:05:05.778 --> 00:05:06.614
[anguished yell]

00:05:06.647 --> 00:05:09.285
Mystvearn: Accept
your destruction!

00:05:09.318 --> 00:05:11.823
[agonized cries]

00:05:17.602 --> 00:05:20.675
The giant castle-
it isn't moving anymore.

00:05:20.708 --> 00:05:23.614
That means they must have
it distracted on the ground.

00:05:23.648 --> 00:05:24.381
Princess?

00:05:27.287 --> 00:05:28.591
Leona: Help the
other leaders escape

00:05:28.624 --> 00:05:30.360
before the enemy gets
within the walls.

00:05:30.393 --> 00:05:31.329
All: We will!

00:05:31.362 --> 00:05:32.699
Escape, now?

00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:34.503
You still have soldiers left,

00:05:34.536 --> 00:05:36.540
And you won't even
send them into battle?

00:05:36.574 --> 00:05:38.076
You'd make them run?

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.815
To abandon their country?!

00:05:40.848 --> 00:05:45.323
A country is nothing without
its people, your Majesty.

00:05:45.356 --> 00:05:47.828
All we can do
today is survive.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.269
Well - I'm not running!

00:05:51.302 --> 00:05:52.906
I'll fight to the end!

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:54.943
Can't you see
what's happening here?

00:05:54.977 --> 00:05:57.549
All of your forces were
decimated by that giant-

00:05:57.582 --> 00:05:58.550
we're losing the battle!

00:05:58.584 --> 00:05:59.986
Something's coming!

00:06:03.192 --> 00:06:04.796
[devious chuckle]

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:06.098
A monster?!

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:10.274
So - there you are.

00:06:10.307 --> 00:06:11.442
Both: Frizz!

00:06:12.344 --> 00:06:13.947
[devious snicker]

00:06:16.385 --> 00:06:17.688
Sizz!

00:06:19.024 --> 00:06:20.060
Thank you - Princess!

00:06:20.093 --> 00:06:21.796
[taunting cackle]

00:06:22.532 --> 00:06:24.702
We've run out of time.

00:06:34.488 --> 00:06:35.525
Is this it?

00:06:35.558 --> 00:06:37.796
Indeed. It is finished.

00:06:37.829 --> 00:06:40.868
Then this is the most
powerful weapon in the world.

00:06:40.901 --> 00:06:43.172
So, what are you
going to call it, Dai?

00:06:45.778 --> 00:06:48.551
Lon: This sword was
forged for you alone.

00:06:48.584 --> 00:06:51.656
There will never be
another one quite like it.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:53.326
So, it's name...

00:06:53.359 --> 00:06:54.929
Is obvious to me.

00:06:59.038 --> 00:07:03.079
Lon: It shall be known...
as the Sword of Dai!

00:07:04.181 --> 00:07:06.419
A sword with my name...

00:07:06.452 --> 00:07:09.759
It's hypnotizing
to look at, isn't it?

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:41.389
Dai: It feels like it's calling
out to me, or something!

00:07:41.422 --> 00:07:42.658
With this, I...

00:07:48.704 --> 00:07:49.839
Jank: What's wrong?

00:07:51.175 --> 00:07:51.976
Dai: Huh?!

00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:55.216
What's with this thing?

00:07:55.249 --> 00:07:59.058
There's some kind of lock
here - I can't draw it!

00:07:59.091 --> 00:08:00.661
I told you.

00:08:00.695 --> 00:08:03.032
That sword you're
holding is a living thing.

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:06.940
The choice of when and where to
fight belongs to it, as well.

00:08:06.974 --> 00:08:07.809
Dai: What?

00:08:07.842 --> 00:08:10.179
That doesn't sound
very efficient...

00:08:10.213 --> 00:08:13.152
Lon: You'll see
why soon enough.

00:08:13.185 --> 00:08:15.090
Dai: But if I can't draw it...

00:08:15.123 --> 00:08:17.293
Whenever you are in battle,

00:08:17.327 --> 00:08:19.699
And you require
a great power...

00:08:19.732 --> 00:08:21.402
The spirit that dwells within

00:08:21.435 --> 00:08:23.807
the Sword of Dai will
answer that call...

00:08:23.841 --> 00:08:27.013
Only then can the
blade be unsheathed.

00:08:28.684 --> 00:08:30.587
I think I understand.

00:08:35.564 --> 00:08:39.171
[suffering cries]

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.845
Master Mystvearn.

00:08:42.879 --> 00:08:45.283
Mystvearn: Shadow,
have you found them?

00:08:45.317 --> 00:08:46.686
Yes.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.193
The princess and the other
leaders are in the Grand Chapel.

00:08:50.226 --> 00:08:50.761
[pained groan]

00:08:50.795 --> 00:08:52.097
No! They found them.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:53.166
Mystvearn: Good.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:57.007
Take Sovereign Rock Castle
and dispose of them all.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.178
As you command.

00:08:59.211 --> 00:09:00.681
No - not that!

00:09:02.752 --> 00:09:04.655
[delighted chuckle]

00:09:15.712 --> 00:09:17.481
Marin: It's moving.

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:18.917
Apollo: And headed this way!

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:28.003
Everybody, get inside. Quickly!

00:09:28.036 --> 00:09:29.205
Alright!

00:09:29.238 --> 00:09:30.741
Be sure to tell me...

00:09:30.775 --> 00:09:32.811
How the blade
performs in battle.

00:09:32.845 --> 00:09:36.352
Sure. Thank you
so much, Lon Beruk.

00:09:36.385 --> 00:09:38.122
You two, as well!

00:09:38.155 --> 00:09:39.191
Our pleasure.

00:09:39.224 --> 00:09:40.493
And please, Dai...

00:09:40.528 --> 00:09:42.865
Do what you can
to look after Popp.

00:09:42.899 --> 00:09:45.170
But if that boy ever
gets in the way,

00:09:45.203 --> 00:09:46.940
feel free to toss him aside.

00:09:46.973 --> 00:09:49.111
I wouldn't worry about him.

00:09:49.145 --> 00:09:52.751
I think Popp is a lot stronger
than you give him credit for!

00:09:56.927 --> 00:09:59.498
Well, then. I have to go.

00:09:59.533 --> 00:10:03.907
[roaring]

00:10:05.043 --> 00:10:06.078
Zoom!

00:10:20.106 --> 00:10:20.975
C'mon!

00:10:21.009 --> 00:10:23.813
I can't just stand
here and do nothing!

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.993
How can he cast so
many spells at once?!

00:10:30.026 --> 00:10:31.963
Mystvearn: Now,
my former student.

00:10:31.997 --> 00:10:34.969
I have one final
lesson for you.

00:10:36.171 --> 00:10:39.812
Why are you so fixated
on me - Mystvearn?!

00:10:39.845 --> 00:10:42.250
Is it because you know that
I've unlocked a technique

00:10:42.284 --> 00:10:46.559
that can vanquish your
Dark Aura once and for all?

00:10:46.593 --> 00:10:48.095
Or, is it because...

00:10:48.129 --> 00:10:49.064
[snarling]

00:10:49.097 --> 00:10:51.302
You've realized that
I now have the power to

00:10:51.335 --> 00:10:54.509
finally uncover the
secret of your ugly face?!

00:10:54.542 --> 00:10:55.677
Mystvearn: Enough!

00:10:57.581 --> 00:11:00.888
[agonized scream]

00:11:00.922 --> 00:11:05.296
Mystvearn: You shall not
speak another word! Die!

00:11:05.329 --> 00:11:10.206
[pained howl]

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.143
Hyunckel!

00:11:25.871 --> 00:11:27.942
Mystvearn: Who dares?

00:11:27.975 --> 00:11:30.781
Who do you think it
is, you dumb jerk?!

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:32.652
If there's anyone
other than Hyunckel

00:11:32.685 --> 00:11:34.689
who could break the
Aura Hand's grip...

00:11:34.723 --> 00:11:36.391
It must be the boy.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.005
All: Dai!

00:11:57.969 --> 00:11:59.939
Mystvearn: Ah, the hero.

00:11:59.972 --> 00:12:02.310
Indeed, your
mastery of Air Slash

00:12:02.343 --> 00:12:07.755
makes you the only one who
can cleave my Dark Aura.

00:12:07.788 --> 00:12:09.492
Maam [thought]: He's right.

00:12:09.526 --> 00:12:10.426
But...

00:12:11.997 --> 00:12:15.269
Why is Dai using
his old sword?

00:12:15.303 --> 00:12:18.710
I see you have a
new weapon with you.

00:12:18.744 --> 00:12:19.979
Very well.

00:12:20.012 --> 00:12:21.917
Are you confident
that the blade

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:25.891
will endure the power
of a Dragon Knight?

00:12:28.262 --> 00:12:30.867
Come and show me!

00:12:31.803 --> 00:12:34.474
Mystvearn: Well?
I'm waiting.

00:12:36.579 --> 00:12:37.782
No, thank you!

00:12:37.815 --> 00:12:38.984
Mystvearn: What?

00:12:39.018 --> 00:12:41.623
I'd like to, but I don't
think you're worth it.

00:12:41.656 --> 00:12:43.827
It's not me-
the sword says so.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.098
Mystvearn: You
arrogant little brat.

00:12:46.131 --> 00:12:50.206
My Decimation Field
will swallow you, too!

00:12:52.143 --> 00:12:55.216
Dai: Avan Style
Sword Technique...

00:12:56.118 --> 00:12:57.487
Air Slash!

00:13:03.299 --> 00:13:04.869
We can move again!

00:13:07.675 --> 00:13:09.912
Is everybody okay to fight?

00:13:13.987 --> 00:13:17.861
Mystvearn: If he were to use
that power with his new blade...

00:13:19.833 --> 00:13:21.936
Why aren't you using
your new sword?

00:13:21.969 --> 00:13:23.473
Is it not ready?

00:13:23.507 --> 00:13:24.742
Dai: No, that's not it.

00:13:24.776 --> 00:13:25.476
You see...

00:13:26.178 --> 00:13:26.979
Look out!

00:13:37.234 --> 00:13:38.603
Hyunckel!

00:13:38.637 --> 00:13:40.406
His shield's a boomerang?

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.446
Okay, so you're just made
out of weapons, or something?

00:13:43.479 --> 00:13:46.485
Now Dai, leave this
wretched thing to me.

00:13:46.519 --> 00:13:48.422
You can't-
you're wounded!

00:13:48.455 --> 00:13:49.925
Look over there.

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:54.301
It's headed straight
for the Grand Chapel.

00:13:54.335 --> 00:13:58.009
No ordinary attack or spell is
going to take that thing down.

00:13:58.042 --> 00:14:00.046
But with your power...

00:14:01.214 --> 00:14:03.553
Mystvearn: You're all too late!

00:14:08.295 --> 00:14:10.199
Mystvearn [thought]: He's
executing the Air technique

00:14:10.232 --> 00:14:11.903
with such ease!

00:14:15.343 --> 00:14:16.913
Go now, Dai!

00:14:17.815 --> 00:14:19.184
He's right, pal. Now:

00:14:19.218 --> 00:14:21.488
We'll keep things
under control here.

00:14:21.522 --> 00:14:23.560
Protect Leona and the others.

00:14:27.635 --> 00:14:29.170
I've got it!

00:14:32.177 --> 00:14:34.615
Now, let's see it in action.

00:14:34.648 --> 00:14:36.251
The power of
Lon Beruk's blade...

00:14:36.284 --> 00:14:38.322
The power of the Sword of Dai!

00:14:44.702 --> 00:14:45.671
Mystvearn: Shadow!

00:14:45.704 --> 00:14:47.809
Hurry and crush
the Grand Chapel!

00:14:47.842 --> 00:14:49.444
Yes, master.

00:14:58.362 --> 00:15:01.301
There is nowhere
left for us to run.

00:15:03.106 --> 00:15:04.876
Leona [thought]:
Was everyone...

00:15:04.909 --> 00:15:06.579
Were they all defeated?

00:15:13.426 --> 00:15:16.533
Forgive me for my
ignorance, everyone, please.

00:15:16.566 --> 00:15:19.572
Had I known that they were
this were this powerful,

00:15:19.605 --> 00:15:22.778
I would have agreed
to focus on evacuating

00:15:22.811 --> 00:15:25.349
instead of facing
them head on.

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:28.590
It's one thing to die
due to my own rashness,

00:15:28.623 --> 00:15:32.965
but for me to drag all of you
down into this final loss...

00:15:32.998 --> 00:15:34.936
It's shameful.

00:15:34.969 --> 00:15:38.543
King Bengarna, it's too
soon to lose hope.

00:15:38.577 --> 00:15:39.980
I can't agree more!

00:15:40.013 --> 00:15:41.248
Things may look grim,

00:15:41.281 --> 00:15:43.152
but it's up to us
to show leadership

00:15:43.185 --> 00:15:46.024
in the face of adversity...

00:15:46.058 --> 00:15:50.366
You're right.
Yes, you are right.

00:15:53.673 --> 00:15:56.011
[screaming]

00:16:15.784 --> 00:16:18.222
[roaring charge]

00:16:28.944 --> 00:16:30.346
Yes, Dai!

00:16:31.115 --> 00:16:34.120
Dai: Okay, new sword...

00:16:34.154 --> 00:16:37.594
Now's the time to
lend me your power!

00:16:48.482 --> 00:16:49.351
W-What...

00:16:49.384 --> 00:16:51.188
He's going up
against that giant

00:16:51.222 --> 00:16:52.992
with nothing but
a mere sword?!

00:16:53.025 --> 00:16:54.328
No, that...

00:16:54.361 --> 00:16:57.734
That blade is the most
powerful weapon ever created!

00:17:03.546 --> 00:17:05.083
Shadow: You fool.

00:17:05.116 --> 00:17:08.523
A sword can't cut a castle.

00:17:08.556 --> 00:17:10.894
Ignorant child...

00:17:10.928 --> 00:17:13.498
I'll crush you along
with the others!

00:17:20.748 --> 00:17:22.250
Dai [thought]: Here we go!

00:17:22.919 --> 00:17:27.293
[roaring]

00:17:31.068 --> 00:17:32.671
[roaring]

00:17:56.351 --> 00:17:59.223
Shadow: Wh...What happened?

00:18:06.573 --> 00:18:08.876
No!

00:18:16.592 --> 00:18:17.728
Impossible!

00:18:17.761 --> 00:18:20.834
That little boy cut
right through the castle!

00:18:21.603 --> 00:18:23.238
How did he do that?!

00:18:23.974 --> 00:18:25.510
[victorious cheering]

00:18:25.543 --> 00:18:28.148
How's that for
swords and magic?

00:18:41.075 --> 00:18:42.744
Dai [thought]: Amazing...

00:18:42.778 --> 00:18:44.180
With just a normal attack,

00:18:44.214 --> 00:18:47.855
it felt like slicing
through thin air.

00:18:47.888 --> 00:18:52.764
Imagine what would happen if
I were to use all of my power!

00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:56.137
Shadow: Curse you!

00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:04.254
Fire everything we've got!

00:19:04.287 --> 00:19:08.563
Let him feel the might
of Sovereign Rock!

00:19:08.596 --> 00:19:09.898
I don't think so.

00:19:10.834 --> 00:19:12.738
Draconic Aura!

00:19:15.711 --> 00:19:19.183
Leona: Dai's Draconic Aura
is going right into his sword!

00:19:29.437 --> 00:19:31.509
Fire!

00:19:33.914 --> 00:19:37.554
[roaring]

00:19:57.193 --> 00:19:58.630
[surprised breath]

00:19:58.663 --> 00:20:00.166
But... Where...

00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:01.401
Where did he go?

00:20:02.805 --> 00:20:03.640
Wait...

00:20:03.673 --> 00:20:06.244
He's right underneath
this very room?!

00:20:11.756 --> 00:20:14.762
Take this!

00:20:17.433 --> 00:20:19.938
Master Mystvearn-

00:20:23.045 --> 00:20:26.819
[roaring]

00:20:28.255 --> 00:20:31.829
[roaring]

00:20:34.702 --> 00:20:40.479
[roaring]

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.217
Did he actually
cut a castle in half?!

00:21:16.251 --> 00:21:18.021
Dai is unbelievable!

00:21:18.055 --> 00:21:20.593
Wow! What a legend!

00:21:27.908 --> 00:21:28.844
Stunning.

00:21:28.877 --> 00:21:29.978
Dai...

00:21:30.412 --> 00:21:31.715
Where's Dai?

00:21:38.763 --> 00:21:39.965
He's there!

00:21:50.019 --> 00:21:51.087
A true Hero.

00:21:51.121 --> 00:21:52.924
He did it!

00:23:37.901 --> 00:23:39.370
Narrator: After
Sovereign Rock Castle

00:23:39.404 --> 00:23:41.876
has been destroyed
by Dai's new blade,

00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:46.251
an enraged Mystvearn strikes
back with unfathomable power.

00:23:46.284 --> 00:23:48.322
But Killvearn the
Reaper intervenes

00:23:48.355 --> 00:23:50.961
and convinces his
colleague to retreat.

00:23:50.994 --> 00:23:55.670
Popp pursues, but his haste may
have led him into a trap...

00:23:55.704 --> 00:23:57.440
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:57.473 --> 00:24:00.346
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:00.379 --> 00:24:02.517
"The Field of Death".
