WEBVTT

00:01:53.393 --> 00:01:54.763
Chiu: [exhausted sigh]

00:01:54.796 --> 00:01:57.135
That was pretty rough.

00:01:57.168 --> 00:01:58.604
But hey, here we are!

00:01:58.638 --> 00:02:01.711
You're the first member
of the Beast King Commandos!

00:02:01.744 --> 00:02:03.714
You're a Terrordactyl...

00:02:03.747 --> 00:02:06.920
So why don't I call
you "Terry"! You like?

00:02:06.954 --> 00:02:08.524
[approving screech]

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.307
[chuckling]

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.680
You want to
join too, Gomechan?

00:02:19.713 --> 00:02:21.248
[agreeing chirps]

00:02:22.184 --> 00:02:23.788
Alright, but you
have to remember

00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:25.725
who's in charge
around here.

00:02:25.758 --> 00:02:26.827
You got that?

00:02:29.432 --> 00:02:31.302
Chiu: Is that a fire?

00:02:32.104 --> 00:02:33.106
[questioning chirp]

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.345
No. Our real mission
is to the north.

00:02:43.427 --> 00:02:45.898
Nova: My name is... Nova.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.969
I'm the hero...

00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:49.471
Of the North

00:02:49.506 --> 00:02:50.541
The what?!

00:02:52.211 --> 00:02:54.849
Dai: The Hero of the North?

00:02:57.454 --> 00:03:01.262
Nova: I'll use a Zoom spell
and go rescue Zababa myself.

00:03:01.831 --> 00:03:04.168
You best stay here.

00:03:04.202 --> 00:03:06.840
I don't need the help
of a bunch of amateurs.

00:03:07.842 --> 00:03:08.678
"Amateurs"?

00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:10.915
Do you have any
idea know who we are?!

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:15.090
The self-proclaimed
"Heroes" from Papnica, right?

00:03:15.123 --> 00:03:15.891
[unimpressed chuckle]

00:03:16.794 --> 00:03:17.896
Why, you!

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:19.666
Bowson: That's enough, Nova.

00:03:21.603 --> 00:03:24.108
What is it, Dad?

00:03:24.141 --> 00:03:25.243
Wait, "Dad"?!

00:03:25.277 --> 00:03:27.648
Bowson: Please excuse him.

00:03:27.682 --> 00:03:32.157
Nova is my son, and Captain
of the Knights of Ringaia...

00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:34.228
but his manners need work.

00:03:34.261 --> 00:03:37.669
Nova, do not disrespect
the Hero's party!

00:03:37.702 --> 00:03:40.541
Nova: What's wrong
with stating the truth?

00:03:40.575 --> 00:03:46.385
Besides, I can't stand everybody
calling themselves Heroes.

00:03:46.418 --> 00:03:48.825
There's only one
authentic Hero...

00:03:48.858 --> 00:03:51.830
It's time the rest
of the world learned it.

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:56.840
You jerk!
That's our whole thing!

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.378
Popp! Calm down!

00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:01.216
Hold me back, Dai!

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:03.887
We don't have time
for this - cut it out!

00:04:05.123 --> 00:04:06.860
[fuming]

00:04:06.893 --> 00:04:11.536
Dai: Wait. Nova, will you
please take us with you?

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.609
We have a better chance
if we fight together!

00:04:15.945 --> 00:04:16.980
So then...

00:04:17.013 --> 00:04:18.282
You must be Dai.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.031
[chuckling]

00:04:28.637 --> 00:04:29.639
Huh?!

00:04:35.818 --> 00:04:36.854
That was...

00:04:36.887 --> 00:04:38.557
An Aura Shot...

00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:41.295
Crocodine [thought]: And
he's pretty skilled with it.

00:04:43.734 --> 00:04:44.636
Nova: No, thanks.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.073
I'll be taking
care of this alone.

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:50.047
I'd heard all of the rumors...

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.954
but having to be compared to
a tiny little shrimp like you?

00:04:53.987 --> 00:04:56.025
It irritates me.

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:59.364
Anyway. I've got
somewhere to be.

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.235
Nova: Zoom!

00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:02.705
Wait, Nova...

00:05:03.272 --> 00:05:04.909
Get back here!

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:09.853
That snotty, little...

00:05:09.887 --> 00:05:12.959
What a hopelessly
selfish Hero he is.

00:05:14.195 --> 00:05:15.598
Please, forgive me.

00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:18.671
I tried to keep the
boy modest and humble,

00:05:18.704 --> 00:05:21.643
but these days,
he can barely hear me.

00:05:21.676 --> 00:05:23.914
I mean, talk about arrogance!

00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:26.686
Bowson: The Ringaia Army
was dispatched to Orzam

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.728
to keep them from being
wiped out - it was my call.

00:05:30.761 --> 00:05:32.397
But then...

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.466
That's when...

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:36.573
The Dark Army
attacked our homeland.

00:05:36.606 --> 00:05:39.144
Nova still believes that
he could have pushed back

00:05:39.178 --> 00:05:41.349
against the siege if
he was there.

00:05:41.382 --> 00:05:43.119
And who knows?

00:05:44.421 --> 00:05:47.695
It was General Baran
who destroyed Ringaia.

00:05:47.728 --> 00:05:50.467
Even if your son
had been there...

00:05:50.501 --> 00:05:54.710
Guys like that don't learn
a thing until they get beat!

00:05:54.743 --> 00:05:57.548
Maam: But it's much too
dangerous for him to go alone...

00:05:57.582 --> 00:06:00.554
Popp: Yeah, well, he thinks
he's better off alone!

00:06:01.657 --> 00:06:03.025
Leona: We could talk all day

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:06.398
about who's arrogant or
self-centered, or whatever.

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:09.973
But the port is our
strategic foothold in the area.

00:06:11.275 --> 00:06:12.478
Leona's right.

00:06:12.512 --> 00:06:13.947
We need to go help him!

00:06:13.981 --> 00:06:16.319
Come on! Didn't he
get on your nerves?

00:06:16.352 --> 00:06:18.423
Yeah... but it
doesn't matter to me.

00:06:18.456 --> 00:06:20.828
He's a Hero, too.

00:06:20.862 --> 00:06:23.767
The more formidable our
allies are, the better.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.604
It really makes no difference

00:06:25.638 --> 00:06:27.676
how many Heroes
there are, does it?

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:29.912
As long as we work together.

00:06:31.115 --> 00:06:32.484
[laughing]

00:06:32.518 --> 00:06:35.692
Dai. Looks like you
won this one, as well.

00:06:35.725 --> 00:06:36.660
How...

00:06:36.693 --> 00:06:39.331
Ah, well, how do you
see things so clearly?

00:06:39.365 --> 00:06:41.101
Guess you're right again.

00:06:41.837 --> 00:06:42.873
Let's go!

00:06:42.906 --> 00:06:44.074
Okay!

00:06:46.747 --> 00:06:49.351
We're going to fly ahead
and catch up with Nova.

00:06:49.385 --> 00:06:51.155
Everyone else,
follow on foot.

00:06:51.188 --> 00:06:52.491
Right. Got it!

00:06:52.526 --> 00:06:54.361
Leona: Not so fast, Popp.

00:06:54.395 --> 00:06:56.365
Leona: I had new
clothes made for you

00:06:56.398 --> 00:06:59.338
from the same
material as Dai's.

00:06:59.371 --> 00:07:02.411
Thanks, Princess.
But we're in a hurry.

00:07:02.444 --> 00:07:05.217
Plus, there's nowhere
for me to change.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.320
It's armor, not pajamas.

00:07:07.354 --> 00:07:09.091
Wear it over your clothes!

00:07:10.861 --> 00:07:12.397
Bowson: My son.

00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:13.901
Can you...

00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:15.337
Look... after him?

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:16.606
I will!

00:07:30.668 --> 00:07:35.711
Soldiers: [pained groans]

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:47.568
Oh, look.

00:07:47.602 --> 00:07:50.039
Another toy for
us to play with.

00:07:50.073 --> 00:07:54.014
When will the real Hero
show his face at last?

00:07:54.047 --> 00:07:54.916
Nova: [scoff]

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.956
I guess you three
can't see very well.

00:07:57.989 --> 00:07:59.425
What?

00:07:59.458 --> 00:08:02.231
The real Hero is
right in front of you.

00:08:02.264 --> 00:08:03.734
Is he?

00:08:04.903 --> 00:08:06.139
Nova!

00:08:06.172 --> 00:08:07.708
Please sir, just run!

00:08:08.375 --> 00:08:10.046
Th-That's right.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.050
Wait until Dai gets here!

00:08:14.656 --> 00:08:16.794
Listen to your friends here.

00:08:16.827 --> 00:08:18.531
If you're so eager to fight,

00:08:18.564 --> 00:08:20.535
you'd stand a better
chance if that boy,

00:08:20.568 --> 00:08:22.471
Dai, was here as well.

00:08:22.505 --> 00:08:23.974
Capeesh?

00:08:28.149 --> 00:08:29.953
Popp: This stuff is amazing!

00:08:29.987 --> 00:08:34.161
It's light, but it also feels
like it's tougher than steel!

00:08:34.194 --> 00:08:37.401
Dai: Hey! Wait up.

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:39.438
I'm still getting used
to casting Levizoom

00:08:39.471 --> 00:08:40.941
without my crest!

00:08:42.579 --> 00:08:44.549
Well, if you insist.

00:08:48.523 --> 00:08:49.559
Popp: Oh, well.

00:08:49.592 --> 00:08:51.329
You keep getting
stronger and stronger

00:08:51.362 --> 00:08:54.001
in ways no one
thought possible, so...

00:08:54.035 --> 00:08:57.274
It kinda feels nice to still be
better than you at something.

00:08:57.307 --> 00:08:58.343
Y'know?

00:08:58.376 --> 00:09:00.146
Well... I guess so...

00:09:01.315 --> 00:09:04.321
Popp: [laughing]

00:09:04.355 --> 00:09:06.893
Nova: Don't make me
repeat myself.

00:09:09.599 --> 00:09:12.003
Nova is the one true Hero.

00:09:12.036 --> 00:09:13.372
Not this Dai!

00:09:13.405 --> 00:09:16.680
Nova [thought]: All everyone
talks about is that kid...

00:09:16.713 --> 00:09:18.717
What's so great about him?!

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:23.660
Hym: Stay back, everybody.

00:09:23.693 --> 00:09:26.566
Egotistical fools like him...

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.070
They need to be
humbled, sometimes.

00:09:35.083 --> 00:09:37.220
[roaring]

00:09:44.067 --> 00:09:45.837
Hym: [laughing]

00:09:45.871 --> 00:09:48.042
I suppose you
didn't get the memo

00:09:48.075 --> 00:09:52.050
that my friends and I are
made of pure Orichalcum.

00:09:52.083 --> 00:09:53.988
Nova: I see.

00:09:54.021 --> 00:09:55.223
But, still.

00:09:55.256 --> 00:09:59.130
Breaking my sword won't stop
this next attack I have planned.

00:10:00.033 --> 00:10:00.901
Hym: What?!

00:10:09.185 --> 00:10:10.854
Is that...

00:10:14.194 --> 00:10:15.664
Aura Blade.

00:10:16.834 --> 00:10:19.606
Orichalcum may be
tougher than steel,

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:22.846
but it can still be
broken by a greater force.

00:10:22.879 --> 00:10:24.849
And the edge
created by my aura

00:10:24.883 --> 00:10:29.324
is sharper than any
legendary weapon in creation!

00:10:31.229 --> 00:10:32.231
Dai: There they are!

00:10:32.264 --> 00:10:34.034
Popp: And Nova's all right!

00:10:35.604 --> 00:10:37.976
Well, finally.

00:10:38.009 --> 00:10:38.977
Nova!

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:40.414
Back off, kid!

00:10:40.447 --> 00:10:41.382
But...

00:10:41.415 --> 00:10:43.486
Wait. That's an Aura Blade.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.822
He could win.

00:10:46.326 --> 00:10:48.864
I said to stay back.

00:10:49.498 --> 00:10:50.434
Come on.

00:10:50.467 --> 00:10:53.673
Nova: Fine, then. Take this!

00:10:55.043 --> 00:10:58.850
[roaring]

00:11:00.721 --> 00:11:02.959
Northern...

00:11:02.992 --> 00:11:04.862
Grand...

00:11:07.935 --> 00:11:09.839
Blade!

00:11:11.543 --> 00:11:14.949
[roaring]

00:11:22.998 --> 00:11:26.239
Hey! He pulled it off! Great!

00:11:26.272 --> 00:11:28.175
Not quite...

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:30.847
[chuckling]

00:11:33.286 --> 00:11:35.624
Hym: That actually hurt.

00:11:35.657 --> 00:11:37.060
Not badly, really,

00:11:37.093 --> 00:11:41.134
but I guess for a mere human
it's something to be proud of.

00:11:41.435 --> 00:11:42.437
[gasp]

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.919
[trembling]

00:11:57.401 --> 00:11:59.037
Hym: I'm impressed.

00:12:02.912 --> 00:12:04.950
For a first round...

00:12:04.983 --> 00:12:07.120
that was kind of fun.

00:12:24.321 --> 00:12:25.924
No, he's...

00:12:26.693 --> 00:12:27.561
Impossible!

00:12:27.595 --> 00:12:28.863
Not even a scratch?!

00:12:30.534 --> 00:12:33.072
Dai [thought]: That should
have done something...

00:12:33.106 --> 00:12:35.578
No matter how tough he is!

00:12:35.611 --> 00:12:37.915
Hym: It's quite simple.

00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:40.487
Even humans have
the ability to focus

00:12:40.521 --> 00:12:42.892
what frail energy they have.

00:12:42.925 --> 00:12:45.865
It's how you increase
defensive power.

00:12:45.898 --> 00:12:48.369
So I thought I'd
try to give it a shot.

00:12:48.403 --> 00:12:51.642
The thing is, I knew you
would aim for my head.

00:12:51.676 --> 00:12:54.214
And if I focused
all my power there,

00:12:54.247 --> 00:12:56.853
I could withstand
your attack.

00:12:58.222 --> 00:12:59.826
Dai [thought]:
They're strong.

00:12:59.859 --> 00:13:03.031
They're unlike any
enemy we've ever faced!

00:13:03.065 --> 00:13:05.102
Popp [thought]:
One thing is clear.

00:13:05.136 --> 00:13:09.078
They're not strong only because
they're made of Orichalcum...

00:13:09.111 --> 00:13:12.551
They were created to fight.

00:13:12.585 --> 00:13:14.154
All they know is combat...

00:13:14.187 --> 00:13:16.793
living, breathing
weapons of war.

00:13:16.827 --> 00:13:19.565
Total masters
of the battlefield.

00:13:21.769 --> 00:13:22.470
Nova: Curse you.

00:13:22.504 --> 00:13:23.607
Dai: Wait, Nova!

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.276
Don't touch me!

00:13:25.309 --> 00:13:26.378
I still have...

00:13:26.411 --> 00:13:27.682
Some strength!

00:13:27.715 --> 00:13:28.550
My next attack-

00:13:28.584 --> 00:13:29.819
Popp: Knock it off!

00:13:29.852 --> 00:13:31.255
You're smart
enough to realize

00:13:31.288 --> 00:13:34.160
how dangerous these
guys are, aren't you?

00:13:35.496 --> 00:13:37.601
The mage is quite right.

00:13:37.634 --> 00:13:39.639
Come on, we have
to work together!

00:13:39.672 --> 00:13:40.373
Never!

00:13:40.406 --> 00:13:41.042
What?!

00:13:41.075 --> 00:13:43.547
I am the Hero of the North.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.383
I will defeat them...

00:13:45.416 --> 00:13:46.820
And without your help!

00:13:46.853 --> 00:13:48.021
Dai: Look around you!

00:13:49.257 --> 00:13:56.606
[pained groans]

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.109
They all need help.

00:13:58.142 --> 00:13:59.745
Isn't protecting the people

00:13:59.779 --> 00:14:02.518
what a real Hero
is supposed to do?!

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:04.856
Winning this fight...

00:14:04.889 --> 00:14:06.358
will protect them!

00:14:06.392 --> 00:14:07.562
That's not the way!

00:14:07.595 --> 00:14:09.064
Shut up!

00:14:10.366 --> 00:14:11.368
Nova!

00:14:11.869 --> 00:14:13.206
Nova: I won't...

00:14:13.239 --> 00:14:16.345
I won't let you
lecture me about being...

00:14:16.378 --> 00:14:17.648
a Hero!

00:14:24.863 --> 00:14:26.231
Needle...

00:14:28.236 --> 00:14:29.404
Thousand.

00:14:33.847 --> 00:14:36.385
[pained scream]

00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:37.955
Nova!

00:14:41.763 --> 00:14:43.332
Needle Thousand...

00:14:43.365 --> 00:14:46.304
Isn't that a
but much? For him?

00:14:47.809 --> 00:14:51.783
Albinass: It would be rude to
make our guest of honor wait.

00:14:51.816 --> 00:14:54.955
Allow me a slightly
belated introduction.

00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:59.833
We are Lord Hadlar's
loyal servants.

00:14:59.866 --> 00:15:02.739
The Hadlar Royal Guard.

00:15:02.772 --> 00:15:06.344
My role, the queen piece,
and the leader.

00:15:06.378 --> 00:15:07.948
Albinass.

00:15:08.983 --> 00:15:10.621
Hym, the pawn.

00:15:10.654 --> 00:15:13.158
You must remember me, right?

00:15:13.192 --> 00:15:17.134
I am the knight, and
controller of the battlefield,

00:15:17.167 --> 00:15:18.035
Sigma.

00:15:18.068 --> 00:15:19.839
It is a pleasure.

00:15:19.872 --> 00:15:22.243
Fenbren: My name is Fenbren.

00:15:22.277 --> 00:15:27.153
I am the bishop of the
Royal Guard, the hunter.

00:15:30.594 --> 00:15:32.130
What's that?!

00:15:32.163 --> 00:15:35.236
Ah, there's... one more.

00:15:42.752 --> 00:15:44.120
Our ship?

00:15:44.722 --> 00:15:47.026
What's going on?

00:15:50.701 --> 00:15:53.907
Albinass: He is
Block, the rook.

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:59.317
He does not speak,
so I must introduce him.

00:15:59.351 --> 00:16:03.927
Now, Block, that ship is of
great strategic importance.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.362
Give it back!

00:16:05.764 --> 00:16:06.766
Oh, no...

00:16:12.009 --> 00:16:13.613
Everyone, run!

00:16:22.864 --> 00:16:25.169
[pained yells]

00:16:25.203 --> 00:16:28.676
Now, now, Block.
Do be careful.

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:32.718
[cackling]

00:16:32.751 --> 00:16:33.953
Our ship...

00:16:33.987 --> 00:16:37.026
Popp: Dai, this could
actually be our chance!

00:16:37.059 --> 00:16:39.198
Right now they can't
see us through the fire

00:16:39.231 --> 00:16:40.901
and clouds of smoke...

00:16:40.934 --> 00:16:42.805
I'll use my Extreme Spell...

00:16:42.839 --> 00:16:44.609
And finish them off!

00:16:44.642 --> 00:16:45.978
"Extreme Spell"?

00:16:46.011 --> 00:16:47.380
Popp: Yeah...

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.319
An ambush for an ambush.

00:16:50.353 --> 00:16:52.691
Before they can
reveal their power,

00:16:52.725 --> 00:16:54.729
I'll use my Medroa spell.

00:16:54.762 --> 00:16:57.066
And take them out!

00:17:00.173 --> 00:17:01.976
Dai: Popp, what is that?!

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:04.080
Popp: I'm going to
conjure a source of magic

00:17:04.113 --> 00:17:07.119
that will annihilate
them in an instant...

00:17:08.122 --> 00:17:10.225
This thing packs a punch!

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:13.634
Sweet!

00:17:13.667 --> 00:17:15.402
My clothes don't burn!

00:17:19.712 --> 00:17:21.716
Is that an arrow?! Amazing!

00:17:21.749 --> 00:17:22.417
[proud chuckle]

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:24.354
I'll explain it to you later.

00:17:24.387 --> 00:17:27.126
After I destroy these guys!

00:17:28.764 --> 00:17:30.668
Where are they? We won?

00:17:30.701 --> 00:17:34.541
Rather unlikely. Unless
they're weaker than I thought.

00:17:34.575 --> 00:17:37.313
Hym: I guess
I'll go drag them out.

00:17:39.519 --> 00:17:40.554
Sorry.

00:17:40.587 --> 00:17:44.227
I still haven't memorized
your names and faces.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.333
Popp: But it was
nice not knowing you.

00:17:48.002 --> 00:17:49.404
Take this!

00:17:49.437 --> 00:17:50.006
Nova: Hang on!

00:17:50.039 --> 00:17:51.308
Nova?!

00:17:51.341 --> 00:17:52.176
Not yet!

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:55.082
I haven't... been beaten!

00:17:55.115 --> 00:17:57.622
Don't! A normal
spell won't work!

00:17:57.655 --> 00:17:59.525
Maybe it won't, but...

00:17:59.559 --> 00:18:02.798
they'll freeze long
enough to attack.

00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:04.535
Kacrackle!

00:18:10.614 --> 00:18:12.383
Now!

00:18:26.513 --> 00:18:28.148
Popp - no!

00:18:39.171 --> 00:18:41.509
What an impressive spell.

00:18:41.543 --> 00:18:42.645
Ah, great!

00:18:42.678 --> 00:18:46.385
Popp: Oh, no. That one can
deflect magic back at us!

00:18:46.418 --> 00:18:52.463
Sigma: Indeed. This Mirror of
Shahal is the ultimate item.

00:18:52.497 --> 00:18:55.270
It can reflect any
spell that hits it.

00:18:55.303 --> 00:18:57.774
And at the same time...

00:18:57.808 --> 00:18:59.912
It is the ultimate shield.

00:19:00.747 --> 00:19:02.250
This is bad!

00:19:02.284 --> 00:19:03.720
Matoriv: Listen up, Popp.

00:19:03.753 --> 00:19:06.024
There's one thing I
have to warn you about

00:19:06.057 --> 00:19:08.262
when using Medroa.

00:19:08.295 --> 00:19:11.167
Watch out for any
counter spells.

00:19:11.201 --> 00:19:12.203
Counters?

00:19:12.236 --> 00:19:14.174
Matoriv: A Bounce
incantation can

00:19:14.207 --> 00:19:18.148
deflect spells right
back at their conjurers.

00:19:18.181 --> 00:19:21.288
There are also legendary
weapons imbued with

00:19:21.321 --> 00:19:23.058
the same kind of power.

00:19:23.091 --> 00:19:26.264
If the enemy has one,
you'd be toast.

00:19:26.297 --> 00:19:28.570
You'll be the ones wiped out.

00:19:28.603 --> 00:19:32.376
It's why I was too scared to
use this spell back in the day.

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:35.684
I'm fine dying
for my own mistake,

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:39.491
but I couldn't stand it if
I took my friends with me.

00:19:39.525 --> 00:19:40.493
I see.

00:19:40.527 --> 00:19:42.731
So it being too powerful...

00:19:42.765 --> 00:19:46.237
is this spell's greatest
strength and weakness?

00:19:50.346 --> 00:19:54.487
Popp: Now I can't use Medroa
against them, but... it's...

00:19:54.522 --> 00:19:56.726
A silver lining, I guess.

00:19:56.759 --> 00:20:00.099
We would have been obliterated
if it weren't for Nova.

00:20:00.132 --> 00:20:01.936
Dai: Wait! Where is he?

00:20:05.744 --> 00:20:08.850
[menacing chuckle]

00:20:08.883 --> 00:20:09.985
Nova!

00:20:10.019 --> 00:20:11.789
No! That guy's fast.

00:20:11.823 --> 00:20:13.626
Come on...

00:20:14.494 --> 00:20:16.431
D-Dai...

00:20:17.868 --> 00:20:22.644
Nova: It looks like...
you were right... after all.

00:20:26.251 --> 00:20:27.587
I guess...

00:20:27.621 --> 00:20:32.631
I guess I'm...
not a... real Hero.

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:37.240
No Hero would be...

00:20:37.273 --> 00:20:39.243
this pathetic.

00:20:39.779 --> 00:20:41.247
I'm a...

00:20:43.285 --> 00:20:45.624
I'm a fool...

00:20:45.657 --> 00:20:46.659
Nova!

00:20:46.693 --> 00:20:47.628
[laughing]

00:20:47.661 --> 00:20:50.399
It seems the Hero has
learned his lesson.

00:20:51.201 --> 00:20:54.073
Hym: Your whole
body is frozen.

00:20:54.107 --> 00:20:57.949
I can shatter you
with a single punch.

00:20:57.982 --> 00:20:59.886
Into a million pieces.

00:20:59.919 --> 00:21:00.553
Don't!

00:21:00.587 --> 00:21:02.691
You're a bunch of cowards!

00:21:02.724 --> 00:21:04.360
Hym: You're wrong!

00:21:04.394 --> 00:21:07.901
I know how he
feels all too well.

00:21:07.935 --> 00:21:10.339
Some of us have integrity.

00:21:10.372 --> 00:21:12.712
Our lives should have
a beautiful end instead of

00:21:12.745 --> 00:21:15.784
living the rest of
our days in disgrace.

00:21:15.817 --> 00:21:16.519
Right?

00:21:16.553 --> 00:21:17.286
No!

00:21:18.055 --> 00:21:20.994
Here's one... last lesson.

00:21:21.027 --> 00:21:22.463
In this world...

00:21:22.496 --> 00:21:25.202
Hym: There's always
someone more powerful.

00:21:25.236 --> 00:21:26.606
And now...

00:21:26.639 --> 00:21:27.842
goodbye!

00:21:27.875 --> 00:21:29.344
Nova!

00:21:29.377 --> 00:21:31.983
Time to perish... with glory!

00:21:32.016 --> 00:21:33.586
Hym: At last!

00:21:34.555 --> 00:21:35.523
N-No!

00:21:36.324 --> 00:21:39.731
[evil laughter]

00:21:46.713 --> 00:21:49.183
Hyunckel: You talk too
much, but you're right.

00:21:49.217 --> 00:21:52.457
There is always someone...

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:54.895
Someone more powerful.

00:21:58.837 --> 00:22:00.405
