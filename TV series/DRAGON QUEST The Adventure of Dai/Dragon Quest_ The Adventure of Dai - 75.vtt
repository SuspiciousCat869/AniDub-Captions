WEBVTT

00:01:50.387 --> 00:01:52.124
I mean that you're weak.

00:01:52.157 --> 00:01:53.359
Far too weak.

00:01:53.393 --> 00:01:57.368
Dai: Too weak? W-What
are you talking about?

00:01:57.401 --> 00:02:00.207
Master Avan is the
strongest person ever!

00:02:00.241 --> 00:02:02.244
Once upon a time, maybe...

00:02:02.277 --> 00:02:03.547
But not anymore.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.319
Even if he is on our side
in this final battle,

00:02:06.353 --> 00:02:08.891
without that strength
he'll meet a tragic end.

00:02:08.924 --> 00:02:10.695
Hyunckel, how can
you say that?

00:02:10.728 --> 00:02:12.866
Popp: Look at him!
He hasn't lost his edge.

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:16.139
I mean... he saved us from
Killvearn's trap, didn't he?

00:02:16.172 --> 00:02:17.141
He countered a spell.

00:02:17.174 --> 00:02:18.277
It doesn't mean that he has

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.815
enough power to defeat
King Vearn, Popp.

00:02:22.118 --> 00:02:24.856
Well, of course he does.
You're losing it, man.

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:26.158
Hyunckel: Just think about it.

00:02:26.192 --> 00:02:29.165
Hadlar already defeated him
using his original form.

00:02:29.198 --> 00:02:30.568
If Avan had faced him again

00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:32.872
after he became
a Superior Being,

00:02:32.906 --> 00:02:34.976
I doubt he would
stand a chance.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.149
Our fight has reached a level
far beyond his abilities.

00:02:38.182 --> 00:02:39.552
At this point,

00:02:39.586 --> 00:02:42.257
what's the use in bringing
someone so weak along with us?

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.495
Hyunckel: We've all faced
enemies more powerful

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:46.165
than anything
he's encountered,

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.303
and our battles have
honed our skills.

00:02:48.337 --> 00:02:50.575
In fact, I'd bet that
because of those trials,

00:02:50.608 --> 00:02:53.547
our power eclipsed
Avan's long ago.

00:02:55.284 --> 00:02:57.288
You could sense
Hadlar's strength -

00:02:57.321 --> 00:02:59.793
did he seem like
somebody you could beat?

00:02:59.826 --> 00:03:03.133
Because the current Hero
fought him alone and won.

00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:05.871
He even improved
your greatest attack.

00:03:05.905 --> 00:03:07.575
Which is all to
say that Dai has

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.146
grown even stronger
than yourself.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.784
Wouldn't you agree?

00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:15.223
Indeed. I wouldn't
have it any other way.

00:03:15.256 --> 00:03:16.660
Raw power alone?

00:03:16.694 --> 00:03:20.300
I would imagine I'm not
even half as strong as Dai.

00:03:20.334 --> 00:03:23.406
Hyunckel: An accurate
assessment, as always.

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:25.678
From the "Former Hero", Avan.

00:03:26.012 --> 00:03:26.948
Shut up!

00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:28.918
Popp?

00:03:28.951 --> 00:03:30.387
Cut it out.

00:03:30.421 --> 00:03:32.759
You were just as torn up as the
rest of us when he showed up.

00:03:32.793 --> 00:03:35.130
I don't know where all
this attitude's coming from,

00:03:35.163 --> 00:03:37.335
but it's really starting
to get on my nerves!

00:03:37.368 --> 00:03:39.739
Who cares which one
of them is stronger?

00:03:39.772 --> 00:03:40.708
What matters is,

00:03:40.741 --> 00:03:43.379
Master came all this
way just to help us out.

00:03:43.413 --> 00:03:46.352
Isn't that enough?
Why question his kindness?

00:03:46.385 --> 00:03:49.526
Kindness doesn't win battles.

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:52.698
Just, listen. I'm only trying
to state the facts here.

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:57.140
As it stands, Avan is weaker
than Dai, me, and even you.

00:03:57.174 --> 00:03:59.445
Relying on him
would be a mistake.

00:04:00.113 --> 00:04:01.115
Why, you...

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:01.983
No!

00:04:03.253 --> 00:04:05.624
But Maam... He just...

00:04:14.175 --> 00:04:16.781
Either way. The point is;
I refuse it...

00:04:16.814 --> 00:04:20.588
A man like him can
no longer be our leader.

00:04:20.622 --> 00:04:22.826
If you all want to
keep following him,

00:04:22.859 --> 00:04:24.529
I won't stop you.

00:04:24.562 --> 00:04:28.003
But as for me...
I'm staying right here.

00:04:28.036 --> 00:04:29.171
Hyunckel...

00:04:29.204 --> 00:04:31.476
I know it can't
be easy to open up to

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.816
Master Avan with your
history... but...

00:04:38.156 --> 00:04:39.391
Just forget it, Maam.

00:04:39.425 --> 00:04:41.095
Let him stay
here and sulk it out.

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:44.468
If this is how he's gonna be,
we're better off without him.

00:04:44.503 --> 00:04:47.609
Hyunckel, even if everything
you've said is true...

00:04:47.642 --> 00:04:49.979
I'd like you to reconsider.

00:05:01.803 --> 00:05:04.909
Avan [thought]: I see...
Very well, then.

00:05:06.445 --> 00:05:09.586
Everyone, it's time
for us to press onward.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.453
Huh?

00:05:11.422 --> 00:05:14.261
But... But...
Master, hang on...

00:05:14.294 --> 00:05:16.131
It's all right.
He's made himself clear,

00:05:16.165 --> 00:05:18.837
and we should
respect his wishes.

00:05:18.871 --> 00:05:22.745
If this is truly what he wants,
then who am I to stop him?

00:05:29.391 --> 00:05:31.395
Yeah. Everything'll be okay.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:35.872
Hey, Maam?

00:05:35.905 --> 00:05:38.376
Try not to worry. I'm sure
he'll be right behind us.

00:05:38.944 --> 00:05:40.013
Right...

00:05:51.302 --> 00:05:52.873
Vearn: Mystvearn.

00:05:52.906 --> 00:05:53.841
Mystvearn: Yes, sire?

00:05:53.874 --> 00:05:56.345
Vearn: These antics are
taking far too long.

00:05:56.378 --> 00:05:58.850
Return to the palace at once.

00:06:00.888 --> 00:06:02.725
Mystvearn: Is there
an issue, my liege?

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:04.696
Vearn: A strange
turn of events.

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:07.769
Avan De Zinuar has
returned from the dead.

00:06:07.802 --> 00:06:11.943
Mystvearn: Avan? The Hero,
Avan? Interesting...

00:06:11.977 --> 00:06:13.446
But even if he's returned,

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:14.716
I doubt he possesses
the strength

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:16.419
to be of any threat to you.

00:06:16.452 --> 00:06:18.724
Don't be a fool!

00:06:18.757 --> 00:06:21.630
Vearn: It's not Avan's
strength that concerns me.

00:06:21.663 --> 00:06:24.902
His protege has already
surpassed him in that regard.

00:06:24.936 --> 00:06:27.207
The former Hero
possesses a quality

00:06:27.241 --> 00:06:30.313
far more dangerous
than strength alone.

00:06:30.347 --> 00:06:34.254
It's why back in the old days,
I ordered Hadlar to stop him -

00:06:34.287 --> 00:06:36.660
he inspires hope
among the humans.

00:06:36.693 --> 00:06:39.532
And hope can be
a powerful weapon.

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:43.106
Its strength is different
than the kind I believe in...

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:45.109
And Avan is the source of it.

00:06:45.143 --> 00:06:46.780
If we don't deal with him,

00:06:46.813 --> 00:06:50.186
his disciples' power
will continue to grow.

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:51.322
Mystvearn: What of Killvearn?

00:06:51.355 --> 00:06:53.794
I'm sure he would
make swift work of them.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.371
Vearn: Try not to
forget, Mystvearn.

00:06:59.404 --> 00:07:02.077
Although you and the
Reaper share my name,

00:07:02.111 --> 00:07:03.915
you have little
else in common.

00:07:03.948 --> 00:07:06.987
He serves an entirely
different purpose.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.794
Vearn: Unlike you, it is
not his job to protect me.

00:07:10.828 --> 00:07:14.167
He exists to destroy.
That is all.

00:07:14.201 --> 00:07:15.971
Avan is quite intelligent,

00:07:16.005 --> 00:07:20.013
but he made a grave
error in their last encounter.

00:07:20.046 --> 00:07:21.750
He merely wounded his enemy

00:07:21.784 --> 00:07:24.889
when he should have
finished the job.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.715
That stupid old Hero
was such a meanie.

00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:40.921
I can't believe he
ruined our favorite mask.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.133
Yes... I know that when
left to his own devices...

00:07:47.167 --> 00:07:49.873
Killvearn will
seek vengeance.

00:07:49.906 --> 00:07:52.310
Vearn: However,
Avan's return has given

00:07:52.344 --> 00:07:55.483
Dai and the others
momentum. Stop them.

00:07:55.518 --> 00:07:56.820
Mystvearn: I shall.

00:07:56.854 --> 00:07:58.990
Mystvearn [thought]:
But, first...

00:08:05.805 --> 00:08:07.341
You're still worried
about him, huh?

00:08:07.374 --> 00:08:08.342
Yeah.

00:08:08.375 --> 00:08:10.949
Whatever happens,
it's his fault.

00:08:10.982 --> 00:08:12.117
Maybe...

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:13.486
It's just not like Hyunckel

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.791
to abandon us right
before our biggest battle.

00:08:15.825 --> 00:08:18.096
He's just never
been so selfish.

00:08:18.129 --> 00:08:19.832
Avan: Exactly.

00:08:20.969 --> 00:08:24.543
Master... uh, what
do you mean by that?

00:08:24.576 --> 00:08:26.747
Avan: Everybody, listen up.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.449
Once we approach that entrance

00:08:28.482 --> 00:08:30.220
the palace guards
will be alerted.

00:08:30.253 --> 00:08:31.422
When that happens,

00:08:31.456 --> 00:08:34.161
Hyunckel will be swarmed
by a legion of enemies.

00:08:35.665 --> 00:08:37.602
Popp: Why would he
hang back for that?

00:08:37.635 --> 00:08:39.137
Don't be so dense.

00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:42.846
You of all people should
understand what he's up to.

00:08:42.879 --> 00:08:43.780
Think...

00:08:43.814 --> 00:08:46.285
You once did exactly
the same thing...

00:08:46.318 --> 00:08:49.659
back in our battle with
the Dragon Masters, remember?

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:52.665
Popp [thought]:
That's right...

00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:54.468
I wanted everyone
to be able to

00:08:54.502 --> 00:08:56.606
focus on helping Dai
get his memories back,

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.677
so I pretended to
abandon the group...

00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:01.115
and ran off to
face them alone.

00:09:11.001 --> 00:09:12.638
Hyunckel, no!

00:09:22.491 --> 00:09:24.361
He can't do this alone.

00:09:24.395 --> 00:09:25.765
He can't beat them.

00:09:25.798 --> 00:09:27.200
Try to have a little faith.

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:30.841
Consider... what feelings
would make him want to stay?

00:09:31.475 --> 00:09:32.879
If I'm right,

00:09:32.912 --> 00:09:36.118
then he was able to sense the
true extent of my powers...

00:09:36.151 --> 00:09:38.757
Avan: And he understands that
the rest of you are going to

00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:42.197
need my help in order to
navigate the palace safely.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:46.138
So he took on the responsibility
of holding off our foes.

00:09:46.172 --> 00:09:48.844
But if any of you knew
what he was planning...

00:09:48.878 --> 00:09:51.717
you would never have left him
to face such a threat alone -

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.622
he knew he had to hide
his true intentions.

00:09:54.655 --> 00:09:56.058
Do you mean...

00:09:56.092 --> 00:09:58.463
Are you saying that you
knew what he intended

00:09:58.496 --> 00:09:59.733
and you played along?

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:04.576
Yes. I could see it
with just a glance.

00:10:04.609 --> 00:10:06.579
When I trained him as a boy,

00:10:06.613 --> 00:10:07.982
Hyunckel would
often trouble me

00:10:08.015 --> 00:10:10.888
by saying and doing things
that he really didn't mean.

00:10:10.922 --> 00:10:14.729
And every time he did,
he'd get that look...

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:19.138
A sort of mix between
sadness and regret

00:10:19.171 --> 00:10:20.708
that filled his eyes...

00:10:20.741 --> 00:10:22.745
There's no mistaking it.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.561
Now, come on.

00:10:30.594 --> 00:10:33.098
You aren't getting
any further than this.

00:10:33.868 --> 00:10:35.036
Popp [thought]:
Unbelievable.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.307
Why does he always have
to pull these stunts?

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.510
I can't stand it.

00:10:38.544 --> 00:10:40.213
Acting like he
knows everything...

00:10:40.247 --> 00:10:43.052
and keeping the rest of us in
the dark like we're children.

00:10:43.085 --> 00:10:46.927
He goes and hogs all
the glory, again and again.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.398
Well, enjoy it one
last time, Hyunckel...

00:10:49.431 --> 00:10:51.302
and don't you
dare mess this up.

00:10:51.335 --> 00:10:54.475
The next time I see you -
I'm kicking your butt.

00:10:54.509 --> 00:10:55.944
And that's a promise...

00:10:55.978 --> 00:10:58.817
so I'm counting on
you to survive this.

00:11:06.232 --> 00:11:07.502
Took you long enough.

00:11:07.535 --> 00:11:09.739
So who wants to go down first?

00:11:11.275 --> 00:11:13.112
There's only one of you?

00:11:13.145 --> 00:11:14.114
Wow is he dumb!

00:11:14.147 --> 00:11:15.884
Monster: You're
outnumbered, little man.

00:11:15.918 --> 00:11:17.120
Unless you get through us,

00:11:17.154 --> 00:11:19.526
you'll never make it
inside the palace.

00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:20.928
Well, in that case...

00:11:20.962 --> 00:11:23.099
I guess there's
nothing to fear.

00:11:23.132 --> 00:11:24.201
Both: What?

00:11:24.234 --> 00:11:25.403
Hyunckel: First of all,

00:11:25.437 --> 00:11:28.309
taking care of you halfwits
will be a walk in the park.

00:11:28.342 --> 00:11:29.512
And secondly...

00:11:29.546 --> 00:11:32.016
if you're all out here, that
means there's no one inside

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:33.921
to get in the
way of my friends...

00:11:33.954 --> 00:11:36.492
I just have to keep you busy.

00:11:36.526 --> 00:11:37.695
Why, you little brat...

00:11:37.728 --> 00:11:39.365
You're gonna regret it!

00:11:39.398 --> 00:11:40.466
Monster: Get him!

00:11:50.787 --> 00:11:51.957
That does it...

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:55.664
Monsters: [furious roaring]

00:11:55.698 --> 00:11:58.269
Sounds like they're
getting started.

00:11:58.302 --> 00:12:00.473
You think he'll be okay?

00:12:00.507 --> 00:12:03.145
I trained him
myself, remember?

00:12:03.178 --> 00:12:05.818
And even though he only did
it because of a grudge...

00:12:05.851 --> 00:12:08.524
It seems as if he was
actually paying attention

00:12:08.557 --> 00:12:10.360
to everything I taught him.

00:12:10.393 --> 00:12:11.629
As a matter of fact...

00:12:11.663 --> 00:12:14.702
at this very moment he's using
a strategy that I came up with

00:12:14.736 --> 00:12:17.140
for infiltrating
enemy territory.

00:12:17.174 --> 00:12:19.679
You see, when you're laying
siege upon a fortress,

00:12:19.712 --> 00:12:21.650
the most important
measure to take...

00:12:21.683 --> 00:12:24.121
is not to overcome your
adversary's forces -

00:12:24.154 --> 00:12:27.327
but rather to keep them from
flanking you on your approach.

00:12:27.361 --> 00:12:29.932
Avan: Once the battle begins
your vision will tunnel,

00:12:29.966 --> 00:12:32.070
making it easy to
be taken off-guard.

00:12:32.104 --> 00:12:34.876
The greatest danger is
being attacked from behind.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.813
That's why when you're
choosing a formation,

00:12:36.847 --> 00:12:38.817
it's crucial to have
a powerful fighter

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:40.319
at the front of your party...

00:12:40.353 --> 00:12:44.829
And more importantly, another
one playing the rearguard.

00:12:44.862 --> 00:12:47.300
Avan: I played that role
earlier and held off the Reaper

00:12:47.334 --> 00:12:49.739
while the rest of you
made your way up here...

00:12:49.773 --> 00:12:51.943
Hyunckel's doing the same.

00:12:51.976 --> 00:12:54.749
Wait... That's what you were
doing? Fighting Killvearn?

00:12:54.783 --> 00:12:57.120
No way. I thought
Hadlar took him out.

00:12:57.154 --> 00:12:58.322
He tried,

00:12:58.356 --> 00:13:01.028
but a being like Killvearn
has many tricks up his sleeve.

00:13:01.062 --> 00:13:02.565
It would seem
Hyunckel noticed

00:13:02.598 --> 00:13:04.434
and decided to
return the favor.

00:13:04.468 --> 00:13:07.039
Then how on earth did
you catch up with us?

00:13:07.073 --> 00:13:09.310
Avan: Magic.
A teleportation spell.

00:13:09.344 --> 00:13:11.482
A new one I've
attained called Zip.

00:13:11.516 --> 00:13:12.986
It's become quite handy.

00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:14.655
Never heard of Zip...

00:13:14.689 --> 00:13:16.324
It's a variation of Zoom.

00:13:16.358 --> 00:13:19.064
Its power allows
the user to regroup

00:13:19.097 --> 00:13:21.235
with their allies
almost instantly.

00:13:21.268 --> 00:13:23.640
It's a mystical
enchantment normally used by

00:13:23.673 --> 00:13:25.009
adventurers to
get back on track

00:13:25.042 --> 00:13:27.481
if they find themselves
lost in a labyrinth.

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:28.884
A labyrinth?

00:13:28.917 --> 00:13:30.453
M-Master Avan...

00:13:30.486 --> 00:13:32.725
Does... does
that mean you...

00:13:32.758 --> 00:13:34.528
Were you where
I think you were?

00:13:35.463 --> 00:13:37.100
Huh? No way...

00:13:40.774 --> 00:13:42.377
That's a big gate!

00:13:55.637 --> 00:13:57.040
It almost looks...

00:13:57.073 --> 00:13:59.579
like the Dark Citadel Gate,
only this one is a lot bigger,

00:13:59.612 --> 00:14:01.215
and I'll bet
it's even stronger.

00:14:01.248 --> 00:14:02.283
Are you kidding?

00:14:02.316 --> 00:14:03.887
But you and your dad
barely breached that one...

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.557
You had to combine your power.

00:14:05.591 --> 00:14:06.859
If this one's worse,

00:14:06.893 --> 00:14:09.264
I don't know what we'll do -
it might be impossible.

00:14:09.297 --> 00:14:11.335
There's gotta
be something, Dai.

00:14:11.368 --> 00:14:15.076
I mean... Coming all this
way just to hit a dead end?

00:14:15.109 --> 00:14:17.915
Avan: There is something.
Now stand back.

00:14:17.949 --> 00:14:19.217
This is the reason.

00:14:19.251 --> 00:14:22.725
Why Hyunckel gave me the
lead while he stayed behind.

00:14:22.758 --> 00:14:25.029
I know exactly how
to deal with this gate.

00:14:25.063 --> 00:14:28.537
I'll have to unleash...
the greatest power...

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:29.337
The greatest power...

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:31.910
I attained in all
of my training.

00:14:31.943 --> 00:14:33.312
All: Training?

00:14:33.345 --> 00:14:34.114
That's right.

00:14:34.147 --> 00:14:35.918
I've spent all
this time away...

00:14:35.952 --> 00:14:39.024
Honing skills for
this very battle...

00:14:39.058 --> 00:14:42.363
I was deep underground
in the Carl Kingdom...

00:14:42.397 --> 00:14:45.470
in the deepest shadows
of the Cave of Trials.

00:14:45.504 --> 00:14:47.207
All: What?!

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.144
Wait a sec. Isn't
the Cave of Trials...

00:14:49.177 --> 00:14:52.017
W-where Leona...
found that Kaglimmer spell?

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:54.487
I guess that makes sense...

00:14:54.522 --> 00:14:55.524
I knew it!

00:14:55.558 --> 00:14:56.960
That means, Master Avan...

00:14:56.993 --> 00:14:59.532
you must've gone even
deeper than we did.

00:14:59.566 --> 00:15:00.500
Amazing...

00:15:00.534 --> 00:15:01.837
You went all the way to

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:03.941
the lowest levels
of the cavern, right?

00:15:03.974 --> 00:15:05.342
Leona: And down there,

00:15:05.376 --> 00:15:09.819
you found Purifying Spells
that were even more powerful.

00:15:09.852 --> 00:15:13.493
Back then, on the day
I lost to Hadlar...

00:15:13.527 --> 00:15:14.529
even though I was spared

00:15:14.562 --> 00:15:17.100
thanks to the charm
inside my Amulet of Carl,

00:15:17.133 --> 00:15:19.070
the force of the Megante...

00:15:19.104 --> 00:15:20.774
still took its
toll on my body.

00:15:20.808 --> 00:15:22.310
I was sent flying...

00:15:22.344 --> 00:15:25.349
Before I hit the ground,
everything went black.

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:28.288
Avan: When I came to, I found
myself adrift in the ocean

00:15:28.322 --> 00:15:30.459
off the coast
of Dermline Island.

00:15:30.493 --> 00:15:33.198
That's when I realized
the amulet had saved me.

00:15:33.232 --> 00:15:36.506
It was almost as if I could hear
the God of Humanity whispering,

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.108
"You aren't finished yet."

00:15:39.344 --> 00:15:41.282
Dai, and Popp...

00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:42.518
I was there,

00:15:42.551 --> 00:15:46.125
watching as you took your first
steps on this long journey.

00:15:46.158 --> 00:15:48.763
Avan: Broken and
battered, I saw it all.

00:15:48.797 --> 00:15:50.099
It would have been so easy

00:15:50.132 --> 00:15:52.404
to call out and join
you on your adventure...

00:15:52.437 --> 00:15:54.407
To share the full wealth
of my knowledge...

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.915
But I was too ashamed
to bring myself to do it.

00:15:57.948 --> 00:15:59.484
Make no mistake,

00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:02.591
I wanted to help you both
continue to learn and grow...

00:16:02.625 --> 00:16:04.294
only after what happened,

00:16:04.327 --> 00:16:06.498
I wasn't able to
forgive my own weakness.

00:16:06.533 --> 00:16:08.770
I sensed that Dai's
inherent strength

00:16:08.804 --> 00:16:10.439
already exceeded my own...

00:16:10.472 --> 00:16:14.280
more than any pupil I'd ever
crossed paths with before.

00:16:14.314 --> 00:16:17.688
If I went with you, I would
only hinder your progress...

00:16:17.721 --> 00:16:20.928
Avan: If I wanted to be
of use, I had work to do.

00:16:20.961 --> 00:16:23.666
I needed to train
myself in body and mind,

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.202
and gather a new
set of abilities

00:16:25.236 --> 00:16:26.640
that would give
you an advantage...

00:16:26.673 --> 00:16:30.880
otherwise I wouldn't be
worthy to fight by your side.

00:16:30.914 --> 00:16:34.788
Avan: And so I decided to
perfect my purification magic.

00:16:34.822 --> 00:16:36.158
I journeyed back
to my homeland

00:16:36.191 --> 00:16:38.930
to use the Cave of Trials
as my training grounds.

00:16:38.964 --> 00:16:41.035
If there were any place
in existence that could

00:16:41.068 --> 00:16:44.341
give me what I needed,
it was there.

00:16:44.374 --> 00:16:46.411
Avan: Even if I was
lacking in strength,

00:16:46.445 --> 00:16:49.384
I knew with the right
incantations under my belt,

00:16:49.417 --> 00:16:52.123
I could help you
defeat the Dark King.

00:16:52.156 --> 00:16:55.429
Dai [thought]: I get it.
That explains everything.

00:16:55.463 --> 00:16:57.500
Popp [thought]: Master never
really abandoned us...

00:16:57.534 --> 00:16:59.237
He was gone all
this time because

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:01.241
he was searching
for a way to help.

00:17:01.274 --> 00:17:02.377
Maam [thought]:
He's been fighting

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.883
just as hard as
the rest of us...

00:17:04.916 --> 00:17:06.853
and all on his own, too.

00:17:06.886 --> 00:17:08.122
From there,

00:17:08.155 --> 00:17:10.460
my training began, and
over the next few months,

00:17:10.493 --> 00:17:13.098
I continued deeper into
the Cave of Trials,

00:17:13.131 --> 00:17:14.568
searching every
chamber to collect

00:17:14.602 --> 00:17:17.240
the ultimate
Purifying Spell-craft.

00:17:26.893 --> 00:17:28.362
Once I passed
the fiftieth level,

00:17:28.395 --> 00:17:30.568
there were no more
spells to find...

00:17:30.601 --> 00:17:40.386
and the labyrinth became
even more complex.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.290
By that point,
I was running low...

00:17:42.323 --> 00:17:44.161
on healing items and rations.

00:17:44.194 --> 00:17:45.664
All that lay ahead of me was

00:17:45.698 --> 00:17:48.737
a countless number
of terrifying traps.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:50.173
But... we can discuss

00:17:50.206 --> 00:17:52.310
the rest of my
adventures another time.

00:17:52.343 --> 00:17:54.414
Basically, at its
deepest levels,

00:17:54.447 --> 00:17:57.120
the cave tests the explorer's
knowledge and resolve.

00:17:57.153 --> 00:17:59.057
Many never find a way back.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.028
When Princess Leona
obtained her Kaglimmer

00:18:01.061 --> 00:18:02.531
on one of the upper levels,

00:18:02.564 --> 00:18:04.434
its power rippled
all the way to me.

00:18:04.467 --> 00:18:07.808
That's how I knew the final
battle was nearly at hand.

00:18:07.842 --> 00:18:09.377
Well done, Your Highness.

00:18:09.411 --> 00:18:12.417
Avan: By the way, what level
were you on when you did it?

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:14.788
Twenty-five floors
underground.

00:18:14.822 --> 00:18:16.225
And how far down were you?

00:18:16.258 --> 00:18:17.493
You must've been close.

00:18:18.028 --> 00:18:19.063
Let's see...

00:18:19.097 --> 00:18:20.867
I believe I was
somewhere around

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.707
one-hundred and
fifty levels down.

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:27.748
For a human... that might
be a new record, you know?

00:18:27.781 --> 00:18:29.350
[chuckling]

00:18:30.987 --> 00:18:32.256
Avan: Well, then.

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:34.628
Now... Shall we see if
all that work was worth it?

00:18:50.059 --> 00:18:53.866
Leona [thought]: So this is
Master Avan's Purifying Magic.

00:18:55.036 --> 00:18:57.340
[roaring]

00:19:04.253 --> 00:19:05.456
Hyunckel [thought]:
I was right.

00:19:05.489 --> 00:19:08.629
Avan attained the
power of purification.

00:19:12.838 --> 00:19:15.945
A stronger purification
spell than Kaglimmer...

00:19:15.978 --> 00:19:17.379
I can't even imagine it.

00:19:17.413 --> 00:19:20.285
I know, but master has all
kinds of powerful magic, right?

00:19:20.319 --> 00:19:21.622
Especially if
he went a whole

00:19:21.656 --> 00:19:23.760
one-hundred-and-fifty
levels down.

00:19:23.793 --> 00:19:24.862
That's... well...

00:19:24.896 --> 00:19:27.366
that's six times deeper
than twenty-five, so...

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.905
it must be six
times more powerful.

00:19:29.939 --> 00:19:31.341
That's not how
it works, Popp.

00:19:31.374 --> 00:19:34.480
You aren't going to get the
answer using simple arithmetic.

00:19:34.515 --> 00:19:35.617
Popp: Huh?

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:37.521
Math and magic aside,
we don't have

00:19:37.554 --> 00:19:41.061
a spell that's more powerful
than Kaglimmer at the moment.

00:19:41.094 --> 00:19:42.197
It's possible...

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:44.033
But it would have
to be hidden somewhere

00:19:44.066 --> 00:19:46.038
even deeper
within the cavern...

00:19:46.071 --> 00:19:47.173
And I never found it.

00:19:47.206 --> 00:19:49.077
Even in all the
chambers I explored -

00:19:49.111 --> 00:19:50.647
and believe me,
there were many.

00:19:50.681 --> 00:19:54.153
Then... what spell are
you casting right now?

00:19:54.187 --> 00:19:56.859
Oh, it isn't a
spell at all. No...

00:19:56.892 --> 00:19:58.963
"Secret Way of Purification."

00:19:59.932 --> 00:20:02.336
Secret Way of Purification?

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:06.344
Watch and learn. It may
prove to be very useful.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.880
It looks just
like a Kaglimmer.

00:20:23.914 --> 00:20:27.888
I see - I think I understand
how it works after all!

00:20:27.922 --> 00:20:28.690
Both: Huh?

00:20:28.723 --> 00:20:30.827
It's not a spell,
it's a method;

00:20:30.861 --> 00:20:35.102
a secret way to amplify an
incantation's purifying energy.

00:20:35.136 --> 00:20:37.106
Yes! That's correct.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:40.747
Once you master this Secret Way,
the effects of many spells...

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:44.320
Ones that neutralize dark
magic - can be amplified.

00:20:44.354 --> 00:20:46.124
Beyond their limits!

00:20:46.157 --> 00:20:48.830
When I rescued Popp
from Killvearn's trap,

00:20:48.863 --> 00:20:51.401
I used the
barrier-neutralizing spell...

00:20:51.434 --> 00:20:55.442
Safe Passage... and with
the Secret Way, I enhanced it.

00:20:55.476 --> 00:20:57.113
Clearing the flames!

00:20:57.146 --> 00:20:59.017
Popp [thought]: He did
that with a simple

00:20:59.051 --> 00:21:00.754
Safe Passage spell?

00:21:00.787 --> 00:21:01.723
And obviously...

00:21:01.756 --> 00:21:04.094
This... There's only one
spell to use against

00:21:04.127 --> 00:21:05.663
a locked door such as this.

00:21:05.697 --> 00:21:08.368
I get it. It's a
spell for unlocking!

00:21:08.401 --> 00:21:09.872
Now... Click!

00:21:22.397 --> 00:21:25.103
Dark portal, sealed off
since ancient times...

00:21:25.136 --> 00:21:27.006
I command you to open.

00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:29.945
Popp [thought]: It's
exactly the same as before.

00:21:39.397 --> 00:21:41.100
It really worked!

00:21:46.645 --> 00:21:47.948
Monster: How?
That's impossible!

00:21:47.981 --> 00:21:49.886
Monster: The palace gate
hasn't opened in centuries...

00:21:49.919 --> 00:21:52.023
It is now! Oh, boy...

00:21:52.056 --> 00:21:55.129
Hyunckel: I knew you
could do it, Master Avan.

00:21:55.162 --> 00:21:58.536
And as for the rest of you,
seems like our walk in the park

00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:01.008
will have to be cut
a little short.

00:22:01.041 --> 00:22:03.980
Monsters: [furious roaring]

00:23:37.801 --> 00:23:39.471
Narrator: As their
allies in Loroi Valley

00:23:39.505 --> 00:23:40.940
corner Zaboera's forces,

00:23:40.974 --> 00:23:43.546
Avan and his Disciples
prepare to face King Vearn,

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:45.617
and Hyunckel holds
off the horde of monsters

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:47.086
intent on stopping them.

00:23:47.119 --> 00:23:48.288
With Avan scouting the palace,

00:23:48.322 --> 00:23:51.529
he finds himself in need of
a favor from Princess Leona.

00:23:51.562 --> 00:23:52.831
Back on the surface...

00:23:52.865 --> 00:23:54.969
the Mystic Bishop unleashes
a surprise that leaves

00:23:55.002 --> 00:23:56.605
Crocodine and the
others scrambling.

00:23:56.639 --> 00:23:58.743
See how it all unfolds
on the next episode of

00:23:58.776 --> 00:24:00.914
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:00.947 --> 00:24:03.184
"The Steady
Advance of Justice".
