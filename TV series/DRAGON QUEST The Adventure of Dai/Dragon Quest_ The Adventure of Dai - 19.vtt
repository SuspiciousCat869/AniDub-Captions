00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.831
[roaring]

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.472
Zaboera: [worried cry]

00:01:59.506 --> 00:02:00.808
Zaboera!

00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:02.444
[panicked howl]

00:02:03.046 --> 00:02:04.215
[snarling]

00:02:04.248 --> 00:02:06.787
Zaboera: Wait a
minute! I'm not...

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:08.791
Take this!

00:02:08.824 --> 00:02:10.226
[pained yelp]

00:02:10.928 --> 00:02:12.799
Soldier: I'm not really him!

00:02:14.302 --> 00:02:16.039
A Morph spell? Clever.

00:02:16.072 --> 00:02:18.110
Zaboera: [devious laughter]

00:02:18.143 --> 00:02:21.449
It's too bad that
that wasn't the real me.

00:02:21.482 --> 00:02:24.288
How long is it going to take
for you dimwits to realize

00:02:24.321 --> 00:02:29.833
that I'm on a whole other
level of intellect up here?

00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:31.703
Sneaky little imp.

00:02:33.875 --> 00:02:35.644
Mystvearn's gone, too.

00:02:38.818 --> 00:02:40.420
Hyunckel: How did I...

00:02:41.155 --> 00:02:42.959
Where's Hadlar?

00:02:42.993 --> 00:02:45.898
I remember...
defeating him...

00:02:48.938 --> 00:02:51.343
Maam: We made it.
Valge Tower.

00:02:51.376 --> 00:02:53.815
We have to hurry or
Leona won't make it.

00:02:53.848 --> 00:02:55.283
Let's charge right in!

00:02:55.316 --> 00:02:57.121
I knew you were gonna say that.

00:02:57.154 --> 00:02:58.256
Alright, let's go!

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:59.491
Fire minion: Halt!

00:03:02.398 --> 00:03:03.767
The Blizzblaze Legion!

00:03:03.801 --> 00:03:07.775
You're not going to make
it to Master Flazzard!

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:09.211
Get them!

00:03:09.244 --> 00:03:10.514
[worried cry]

00:03:12.084 --> 00:03:13.286
Woosh!

00:03:16.894 --> 00:03:17.962
Dai?!

00:03:17.996 --> 00:03:20.433
We don't have time to waste
dealing with these guys!

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:21.703
Popp, go!

00:03:21.736 --> 00:03:25.343
Yeah. Kafrizz!

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.226
Now; Aim for the
Dancing Flames. Maam?

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.295
I got it!

00:03:34.328 --> 00:03:36.566
Okay... Crackle!

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.358
We did it!

00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:53.166
Looks like anything's possible
if we're working together?

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:55.104
[victorious chuckles]

00:03:55.137 --> 00:03:56.540
Right. We have to move.

00:03:56.573 --> 00:03:57.508
Okay!

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.522
[snarling]

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.829
-[cackling]
-[screaming]

00:04:07.862 --> 00:04:08.964
Oh, no - it's Flazzard!

00:04:08.997 --> 00:04:10.300
Flazzard: Sitting
back and waiting

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:13.875
with the hostage just
isn't my style, you know?

00:04:13.908 --> 00:04:15.778
Here you go!

00:04:15.812 --> 00:04:17.815
And that's one down!

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.367
Flazzard: I know that axe...

00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:29.739
Crocodine: Your
savagery ends here!

00:04:29.773 --> 00:04:34.448
Flazzard: Crocodine? So you
are helping these brats!

00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:36.520
And I'm not alone.

00:04:39.057 --> 00:04:40.060
Both: Hyunckel!

00:04:40.094 --> 00:04:41.262
See? I told you so.

00:04:41.295 --> 00:04:44.970
You can't beat a guy like him.

00:04:45.003 --> 00:04:48.877
Wait. Does that mean he
actually defeated Hadlar?!

00:04:49.746 --> 00:04:50.915
Flazzard: Traitor.

00:04:50.948 --> 00:04:52.351
It occurred to me, Flazzard,

00:04:52.384 --> 00:04:56.025
that my vengeance does not
stop at the Dark Lord...

00:04:56.058 --> 00:04:59.364
And I'm here to settle
that debt with you myself.

00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:02.572
There's no escaping anymore.

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:10.888
Popp: What's wrong?
You giving up?!

00:05:10.921 --> 00:05:12.424
Looks like I am.

00:05:13.392 --> 00:05:15.931
Flazzard: My Blizzblaze
Curse Field is gone.

00:05:15.965 --> 00:05:19.973
And if you have two of the
Legion Commanders on your side,

00:05:20.007 --> 00:05:21.843
even I can't win this one.

00:05:21.877 --> 00:05:26.085
I guess it's time for
me to... face the facts.

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:28.156
He's acting awfully
well-behaved.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.197
Dai [thought]: Flazzard's not
one to give up. Not this easily.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.667
In that case;

00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:37.007
you will admit your defeat and
release the Princess of Papnica?

00:05:37.675 --> 00:05:40.515
Flazzard: Of course I won't.

00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:47.327
Even if I lose everything,
I will never be defeated.

00:05:47.361 --> 00:05:49.732
Popp: Then what was that
about facing the facts?!

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:52.738
I meant the fact I won't
get through this unscathed.

00:05:52.772 --> 00:05:55.010
Because this attack
I have planned?

00:05:55.043 --> 00:05:59.051
It's gonna do quite a bit
of damage to me, as well.

00:05:59.085 --> 00:06:02.692
I'd prefer not to use it,
but here we are...

00:06:04.394 --> 00:06:09.371
Dark King Vearn,
grant me glory and victory.

00:06:14.783 --> 00:06:15.618
What?!

00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:18.591
You would really
throw away your medal?!

00:06:18.624 --> 00:06:20.828
Popp: What's so
important about that?

00:06:22.464 --> 00:06:23.634
On the day...

00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:26.105
That Sovereign Rock Castle
was completed...

00:06:29.178 --> 00:06:30.380
Crocodine: That's right.

00:06:30.414 --> 00:06:33.988
It was the first time
we Six Legion Commanders

00:06:34.021 --> 00:06:36.926
had ever gathered together.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.267
Oh, great and mighty
Dark King Vearn,

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.872
the Six Legion Commanders
of the Dark Army

00:06:42.905 --> 00:06:45.711
stand before you,
ready to serve.

00:06:45.744 --> 00:06:48.951
This Sovereign Rock Castle
shall be our base from which

00:06:48.984 --> 00:06:53.861
we plunge the world into
darkness and offer it to you.

00:06:53.895 --> 00:06:58.503
Vearn: Well done, Hadlar.
I am most pleased.

00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:00.173
Sire.

00:07:00.207 --> 00:07:02.177
Vearn: To celebrate
the formation of

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.887
the Six Legion Commanders,
I shall grant a gift.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:07.888
A gift?

00:07:11.128 --> 00:07:12.798
W-What the...

00:07:15.003 --> 00:07:16.506
What is that?

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.744
Vearn: That is
the Infernal Emblem.

00:07:18.778 --> 00:07:22.786
Consider it the greatest
symbol of loyalty to me.

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:27.796
Now, whoever believes
themselves worthy may take it.

00:07:27.829 --> 00:07:30.200
These flames...
They're quite intense.

00:07:30.234 --> 00:07:35.143
Perhaps, but we must prove our
undying loyalty to King Vearn!

00:07:51.242 --> 00:07:53.346
[victorious cackle]

00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:56.920
Vearn: Well done... Flazzard.

00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:02.497
It was decided...
And he gained the title:

00:08:02.531 --> 00:08:05.369
"Blitz Captain of
the Dark Army."

00:08:05.403 --> 00:08:09.946
That medal is a symbol of
his precious glory. To him...

00:08:09.979 --> 00:08:12.652
it's worth more
than life itself.

00:08:12.685 --> 00:08:14.622
And he threw it away?

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:16.258
[chuckle]

00:08:16.291 --> 00:08:18.262
Who needs the
glory of the past?

00:08:18.296 --> 00:08:20.968
If it lets me
claim new victory...

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:22.838
It's worth it.

00:08:24.108 --> 00:08:25.343
Look out!

00:08:25.377 --> 00:08:29.552
I am willing...
to risk my life!

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:37.735
W-What?!

00:08:37.769 --> 00:08:39.071
He self-destructed!

00:08:39.104 --> 00:08:41.943
Self-destruct?
With a blast this weak?

00:08:41.977 --> 00:08:45.283
He seeks glory even
in destruction.

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:46.853
How disgraceful.

00:08:47.756 --> 00:08:48.623
Ow!

00:08:49.692 --> 00:08:52.230
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

00:08:55.671 --> 00:08:59.045
This is... a piece of
Flazzard, isn't it?!

00:08:59.078 --> 00:08:59.979
What?!

00:09:06.459 --> 00:09:07.427
Could it be?

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.768
Flazzard: Yeah!
It really can be!

00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:13.641
Each one of these
rocks is yours truly!

00:09:13.674 --> 00:09:17.113
And feel how powerful!

00:09:18.416 --> 00:09:22.023
Bullets - Rock Bullets!

00:09:22.424 --> 00:09:23.794
Curse you!

00:09:27.735 --> 00:09:31.141
[pained yell]

00:09:31.175 --> 00:09:32.578
Oh, no - Crocodine!

00:09:32.612 --> 00:09:34.348
Flazzard: [cackling]

00:09:34.381 --> 00:09:37.020
What do you think
you're doing?

00:09:37.054 --> 00:09:41.062
It doesn't matter how strong
you all think you might be.

00:09:41.095 --> 00:09:45.036
Flazzard: The more you break,
the more of me there is!

00:09:45.771 --> 00:09:48.309
This is my final
attack method,

00:09:48.342 --> 00:09:51.550
Rock Bullet
Shrapnel Detonation!

00:09:51.583 --> 00:09:54.088
Then I'll just freeze them all.

00:09:54.121 --> 00:09:55.323
Crackle!

00:10:01.736 --> 00:10:03.339
[pained yell]

00:10:04.274 --> 00:10:07.648
Uh, whoops. He has ice rocks.

00:10:08.517 --> 00:10:09.384
Dai: Popp!

00:10:10.286 --> 00:10:11.590
Dai, don't-

00:10:11.623 --> 00:10:14.629
Looks like
you're up, big Hero.

00:10:15.063 --> 00:10:16.666
Earth Slash!

00:10:19.672 --> 00:10:21.543
[pained yell]

00:10:21.577 --> 00:10:25.984
[delighted laughter]

00:10:27.154 --> 00:10:29.257
Take this!

00:10:30.895 --> 00:10:31.763
No!

00:10:48.531 --> 00:10:49.364
No!

00:10:52.304 --> 00:10:53.372
Hyunckel!

00:10:58.149 --> 00:10:59.685
You bastard!

00:11:00.788 --> 00:11:03.359
Dai, you have
to aim for his core.

00:11:03.393 --> 00:11:04.228
His core?

00:11:04.261 --> 00:11:05.196
That's right.

00:11:05.229 --> 00:11:08.169
He said all of these
rocks are parts of him,

00:11:08.202 --> 00:11:09.772
but that can't be true.

00:11:09.806 --> 00:11:12.879
Hadlar created Flazzard
using forbidden magic-

00:11:12.912 --> 00:11:15.918
his life force is
bound to a single stone!

00:11:15.951 --> 00:11:18.791
There should be a core that's
the source of his power!

00:11:18.824 --> 00:11:21.061
You have to destroy it!

00:11:21.763 --> 00:11:23.600
His core...

00:11:23.634 --> 00:11:24.869
But, how?

00:11:24.903 --> 00:11:27.307
How am I supposed to
find a single rock

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.744
amongst all of these?

00:11:28.777 --> 00:11:32.685
Unless you do,
Flazzard cannot be beaten!

00:11:32.718 --> 00:11:34.789
Flazzard: What are
you talking about?

00:11:36.827 --> 00:11:37.862
There's no stopping

00:11:37.895 --> 00:11:40.367
the destruction
of my ultimate attack!

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.237
C'mon!

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:46.478
Dai [thought]: It's no good.
I can't find it!

00:11:46.512 --> 00:11:48.717
[flying yells]

00:11:50.754 --> 00:11:54.863
No mere human could
shatter my hidden core!

00:11:54.896 --> 00:11:56.900
Let alone find it.

00:11:56.933 --> 00:11:58.937
Dai [thought]:
I can't beat him.

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:02.410
How can I attack
an enemy I can't see?

00:12:02.444 --> 00:12:05.584
Once you cut through the unseen
you will feel the difference.

00:12:05.617 --> 00:12:06.920
Your blade will become three,

00:12:06.954 --> 00:12:10.159
or even five times
more powerful, yet.

00:12:10.193 --> 00:12:12.632
Dai [thought]: An
enemy I can't see...

00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:15.102
That's why he had me train!

00:12:15.136 --> 00:12:19.277
Avan: The air... in other
words, you slice the emptiness.

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:26.627
Maam: Dai...

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.262
He needs a heal spell...

00:12:30.901 --> 00:12:33.373
Flazzard: Looks like
hiding behind Crocodine

00:12:33.406 --> 00:12:35.944
spared you some damage.

00:12:40.788 --> 00:12:42.825
He rebuilt himself?

00:12:45.965 --> 00:12:48.636
Maam [thought]: The fire
and ice are getting weaker.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.943
I look pathetic
to you now, don't I?

00:12:51.976 --> 00:12:53.914
The method of my final attack

00:12:53.947 --> 00:12:56.986
drains the life
force drastically.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.827
Why would you risk your own
destruction just to win?

00:13:00.861 --> 00:13:04.134
Because my being
has no history.

00:13:05.002 --> 00:13:06.807
Flazzard: It's
been barely a year

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.413
since Master
Hadlar created me.

00:13:10.446 --> 00:13:13.988
I want to achieve something!

00:13:14.021 --> 00:13:15.891
Achievements no one can beat

00:13:15.924 --> 00:13:20.032
whether they live to be a
hundred or even a thousand!

00:13:20.066 --> 00:13:22.203
You are so pitiful.

00:13:22.939 --> 00:13:24.775
Can't you prove yourself...

00:13:24.809 --> 00:13:26.846
through something
other than fighting?

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.120
Flazzard: Who asked
for your pity?

00:13:30.153 --> 00:13:33.059
Don't you get it?
The thrill of victory,

00:13:33.092 --> 00:13:35.496
the jealous glares
of my peers...

00:13:35.531 --> 00:13:37.735
These are what fulfill me!

00:13:37.768 --> 00:13:43.379
If you all would just give up,
everything will be perfect!

00:13:43.814 --> 00:13:44.615
Dai: Wait!

00:13:48.256 --> 00:13:48.723
Dai!

00:13:48.757 --> 00:13:49.892
[chuckle]

00:13:49.925 --> 00:13:54.335
Don't you see that you
can't win this, boy?

00:13:54.368 --> 00:13:57.473
Dai: I'm going to
use my final attack now.

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:02.050
It's the greatest technique
of my master, Avan.

00:14:03.887 --> 00:14:06.993
Though, I've never
successfully done it before.

00:14:08.095 --> 00:14:11.469
Dai: If I fail, you win.

00:14:11.503 --> 00:14:16.212
But... If I can do it...

00:14:16.245 --> 00:14:17.849
I win!

00:14:17.882 --> 00:14:18.883
[incredulous chuckle]

00:14:18.917 --> 00:14:21.354
You're just
bluffing, aren't you?

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:22.691
Maam: Dai!

00:14:22.724 --> 00:14:23.993
That attack...

00:14:36.919 --> 00:14:39.324
All right, kid.

00:14:39.357 --> 00:14:43.967
Blizzblaze Shrapnel
Detonation!

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:53.920
He didn't dodge it?

00:14:53.954 --> 00:14:57.360
Avan Style
Sword Technique...

00:14:57.394 --> 00:14:59.230
Air Slash!

00:15:06.846 --> 00:15:08.282
Maam: Did it work?

00:15:12.858 --> 00:15:16.332
[pained breaths]

00:15:16.365 --> 00:15:17.935
[roar]

00:15:18.435 --> 00:15:19.572
[evil chuckle]

00:15:19.605 --> 00:15:23.179
If that measly attack
is his greatest technique,

00:15:23.212 --> 00:15:26.051
I guess Avan's not
so tough, huh?

00:15:26.085 --> 00:15:27.554
Dai [thought]: No...

00:15:27.588 --> 00:15:30.160
I failed.

00:15:30.193 --> 00:15:34.400
Is it... Is it really
beyond me, Master?

00:15:39.444 --> 00:15:40.480
What is it, Dai?

00:15:40.514 --> 00:15:41.348
Go on.

00:15:42.584 --> 00:15:46.057
Dai: That last one, the Air
Slash, I don't really get it.

00:15:46.091 --> 00:15:49.633
Popp: Oh, come on. Master's
explained it tons of times.

00:15:49.666 --> 00:15:51.334
Did you understand it?

00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:55.476
Well, of course not. But I'm
a Mage, so I don't have to.

00:15:56.478 --> 00:15:57.447
That sort of thinking

00:15:57.481 --> 00:16:00.654
is exactly why you're
progressing so slowly.

00:16:00.688 --> 00:16:02.959
Now, what would you do
when you're up against

00:16:02.992 --> 00:16:05.496
an evil swordsman?

00:16:05.531 --> 00:16:09.471
But... An evil swordsman
wouldn't use this skill.

00:16:09.505 --> 00:16:11.141
Huh? Why not, Master?

00:16:11.174 --> 00:16:14.548
Avan: Air Slash requires
an Aura of Justice.

00:16:14.582 --> 00:16:17.454
An Aura of Justice?

00:16:17.487 --> 00:16:19.190
Avan: There are
monsters in this world

00:16:19.224 --> 00:16:22.363
who've been created
by dark magic.

00:16:22.397 --> 00:16:26.438
Air Slash is an attack that
vanquishes such evil beings.

00:16:27.708 --> 00:16:30.346
First off, to do it...

00:16:30.379 --> 00:16:34.254
You charge your blade
with the Aura of Justice.

00:16:35.356 --> 00:16:36.626
And then...

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:42.738
You have to release it toward
the enemy's true form.

00:16:42.771 --> 00:16:45.143
And that's the difficult part.

00:16:45.176 --> 00:16:47.146
Finding the form.

00:16:48.683 --> 00:16:52.023
Unlike the weak spot
of any regular monster,

00:16:52.057 --> 00:16:55.129
you will not be able to see
the form with your eyes.

00:16:55.163 --> 00:16:56.900
Did... you get that?

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:58.937
Um... Kind of?

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:02.143
For now, try not
to worry about it.

00:17:02.177 --> 00:17:05.215
I have no doubt that you'll
pick it up eventually...

00:17:05.249 --> 00:17:08.756
"How does one detect...
the unseen?"

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.171
Dai [thought]:
It's no use, Master.

00:17:17.842 --> 00:17:21.181
I just can't... see it.

00:17:21.215 --> 00:17:23.820
Flazzard: I'll burn
you to a crisp!

00:17:24.788 --> 00:17:26.526
Dai, just run!

00:17:26.559 --> 00:17:27.628
It's too late...

00:17:27.661 --> 00:17:31.769
This is the end!

00:17:36.646 --> 00:17:38.081
How?!

00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:42.891
Looks like his Air Slash wasn't
a complete failure after all!

00:17:42.924 --> 00:17:44.293
How could he?!

00:17:44.327 --> 00:17:47.701
You're telling me that attack
actually damaged my core?

00:17:47.735 --> 00:17:52.779
Okay. I'll keep doing
that until I succeed!

00:17:52.812 --> 00:17:54.649
In that case, once more.

00:17:54.682 --> 00:17:55.784
Are you sure?

00:17:55.817 --> 00:17:58.556
If you use that attack again,
you might not make it!

00:17:58.589 --> 00:18:01.294
Then I'll take
you down with me!

00:18:01.328 --> 00:18:02.764
Flazzard: Besides...

00:18:02.798 --> 00:18:07.608
the risk of getting burned is
what makes it all so much fun!

00:18:07.642 --> 00:18:09.411
[cackling]

00:18:09.444 --> 00:18:12.551
The glory of victory...
it's blinding him.

00:18:12.584 --> 00:18:14.254
Get set, Dai.

00:18:14.287 --> 00:18:17.561
It's a showdown between
our final attacks!

00:18:18.896 --> 00:18:23.740
Rock Bullet
Shrapnel Detonation!

00:18:23.773 --> 00:18:24.875
Dai: Air Slash!

00:18:44.615 --> 00:18:46.084
It's not working!

00:18:46.118 --> 00:18:48.088
Flazzard: With this
many targets,

00:18:48.121 --> 00:18:50.927
you can't even hit
me accidentally.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.500
So it looks like
I win this fight!

00:18:55.671 --> 00:18:57.173
[pained cry]

00:18:57.908 --> 00:18:58.910
No, Dai!

00:18:58.943 --> 00:19:00.245
Popp: Dammit!

00:19:04.387 --> 00:19:05.489
Maam: Is it hopeless?

00:19:05.523 --> 00:19:07.761
Isn't there
anything Dai can do?

00:19:07.795 --> 00:19:08.796
Hyunckel: There is.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.366
Hyunckel!

00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:12.704
Dai is forgetting
something...

00:19:12.738 --> 00:19:16.011
Air Slash is an attack
that slices the empty!

00:19:16.044 --> 00:19:17.681
Unlike the earth and the sea,

00:19:17.715 --> 00:19:21.388
you can't see the emptiness
no matter how hard you try!

00:19:22.156 --> 00:19:23.793
Hyunckel: I need to...

00:19:24.394 --> 00:19:26.064
Remind him of that!

00:19:26.097 --> 00:19:28.168
Dai! Over here!

00:19:29.939 --> 00:19:31.408
Dai: W-What are you doing?!

00:19:31.441 --> 00:19:33.880
Dai! Use your inner eye!

00:19:33.913 --> 00:19:35.316
What do you mean?!

00:19:35.349 --> 00:19:38.322
Listen to me. Your Air Slash
is already a complete attack,

00:19:38.356 --> 00:19:41.228
but you haven't mastered
the technique just yet!

00:19:41.261 --> 00:19:44.802
Once you are able to see
the enemy with your inner eye,

00:19:44.835 --> 00:19:46.271
you'll hone your technique.

00:19:46.304 --> 00:19:49.545
It'll become a true Air Slash!

00:19:49.578 --> 00:19:51.749
Dai [thought]: My inner eye...

00:19:51.782 --> 00:19:53.018
The Air Slash;

00:19:53.052 --> 00:19:57.259
It uses light energy to strike
dark energy and destroy evil.

00:19:57.293 --> 00:20:00.299
Hyunckel: That's the reason
I could never master it.

00:20:00.332 --> 00:20:02.638
Now is the time
for you to inherit

00:20:02.671 --> 00:20:05.643
the greatest Avan
Style technique!

00:20:06.211 --> 00:20:07.581
You fools!

00:20:07.615 --> 00:20:11.756
As if such a sorry fantasy
could defeat my ultimate attack!

00:20:11.789 --> 00:20:14.628
Shrapnel Blast!

00:20:15.597 --> 00:20:16.131
Dai...

00:20:16.165 --> 00:20:17.935
Look out. Just run!

00:20:17.969 --> 00:20:20.439
Dai!

00:20:21.976 --> 00:20:23.445
Dai [thought]: That's right.

00:20:23.479 --> 00:20:28.222
I can't find it because
I keep looking for it.

00:20:28.255 --> 00:20:30.426
Sense it...

00:20:30.459 --> 00:20:34.033
The life energy of
everyone here!

00:20:35.303 --> 00:20:37.975
I feel a warm presence.

00:20:38.008 --> 00:20:41.281
That must be Maam.

00:20:41.314 --> 00:20:44.420
There's Hyunckel.

00:20:44.454 --> 00:20:47.360
The big one is Crocodine.

00:20:47.393 --> 00:20:49.832
That's Popp over there.

00:20:51.035 --> 00:20:52.872
Something's coming.

00:20:52.905 --> 00:20:55.443
A giant, evil energy!

00:20:55.476 --> 00:20:59.618
It's approaching me,
and I can feel it's malice.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.858
I can see it!

00:21:03.192 --> 00:21:04.795
This is...

00:21:04.829 --> 00:21:06.632
His core!

00:21:08.169 --> 00:21:09.538
This is...

00:21:09.972 --> 00:21:11.374
This is...

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:13.779
Flazzard!

00:21:19.759 --> 00:21:21.461
Air Slash!

00:21:39.932 --> 00:21:42.771
Flazzard: Looks like
another dud, boy...

00:21:46.311 --> 00:21:50.119
How did you? That's my...
that's my core!

00:21:50.152 --> 00:21:55.495
It's done.
I have hit... my target!

00:23:37.767 --> 00:23:41.274
Narrator: Dai's Air Slash
strikes Flazzard down,

00:23:41.308 --> 00:23:43.312
but just when
victory is at hand,

00:23:43.345 --> 00:23:45.751
Mystvearn the
Shadow Vizier appears

00:23:45.784 --> 00:23:47.921
with a terrifying surprise.

00:23:47.954 --> 00:23:50.761
After turning himself
into Dark Aura,

00:23:50.794 --> 00:23:54.535
a spiteful Flazzard rises
for another bout...

00:23:54.568 --> 00:23:57.540
Then an incredible
showdown begins.

00:23:57.574 --> 00:23:59.310
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:59.343 --> 00:24:01.549
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:01.583 --> 00:24:04.020
"Now I Slice Everything".
