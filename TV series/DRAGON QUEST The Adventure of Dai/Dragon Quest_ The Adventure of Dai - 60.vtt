WEBVTT

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.232
Crocodine: I refuse to
be the bait in this trap.

00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:58.202
If only we could
warn the others.

00:01:58.236 --> 00:01:59.839
Hyunckel: I know
how you feel.

00:02:00.775 --> 00:02:02.945
I owe all of them my life,

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.584
but if I'm only
a burden... then...

00:02:06.286 --> 00:02:08.289
Lady Amy: Wait! Don't go!

00:02:09.626 --> 00:02:12.765
Lady Amy: Please stop going
so gladly to your own doom.

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:17.575
Mystvearn: Two days from now,

00:02:17.608 --> 00:02:20.314
you won't be a
burden to anyone.

00:02:20.347 --> 00:02:23.286
Why wait?! Let's do it now.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.226
We'd rather dig our own
graves than help you!

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:30.300
Free us... See for yourself!

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:33.173
Mystvearn: Valorous,
but warriors of your caliber

00:02:33.206 --> 00:02:35.076
are still of use to us.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.381
Especially you, Hyunckel.

00:02:37.414 --> 00:02:38.751
Hyunckel: [surprised breath]

00:02:41.322 --> 00:02:43.160
Mystvearn: If you
agree to serve me,

00:02:43.193 --> 00:02:45.865
I'll rejuvenate you
with this Dark Aura.

00:02:46.534 --> 00:02:48.604
You're wasting your time!

00:02:50.073 --> 00:02:52.244
I'll need a day
to think about it.

00:02:52.277 --> 00:02:53.280
You- what?!

00:02:53.313 --> 00:02:54.816
Mystvearn: Very well, then.

00:02:56.252 --> 00:02:58.957
Hyunckel - how could you?!

00:03:03.466 --> 00:03:08.610
You'd really sell your soul
to Mystvearn just to survive?!

00:03:09.178 --> 00:03:10.515
But I thought...

00:03:10.548 --> 00:03:13.053
I thought you were
a man of honor-

00:03:13.086 --> 00:03:16.125
one worthy of respect...

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:20.200
I thought... that
you were my friend!

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:24.208
Here we are, in the
eleventh hour, and you...

00:03:24.241 --> 00:03:26.980
You betray us?!

00:03:27.014 --> 00:03:29.118
Crocodine.

00:03:29.151 --> 00:03:31.824
If you really do
count me as a friend...

00:03:31.857 --> 00:03:35.097
Then I need you to trust me,
no matter what.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.167
Trust you?!

00:03:37.201 --> 00:03:39.071
Hyunckel: I know
how it must seem...

00:03:39.105 --> 00:03:40.541
But I have this feeling...

00:03:40.575 --> 00:03:42.478
I can barely describe it,

00:03:42.512 --> 00:03:46.086
but until I know
there's no option left...

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:50.326
I will not pass on
any chance at survival.

00:04:06.126 --> 00:04:08.463
Farewell.

00:04:10.701 --> 00:04:12.638
[screaming]

00:04:18.416 --> 00:04:20.955
Where... am I?

00:04:23.292 --> 00:04:25.431
Lady Amy: We have
to rescue them!

00:04:25.464 --> 00:04:26.733
Flora: And we will...

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:30.507
But the Dark Army's
announcement is clearly a trap.

00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:32.512
Knowing that,
we must be prepared.

00:04:32.546 --> 00:04:35.952
This mission could very
well cost us everything.

00:04:35.985 --> 00:04:37.588
Whatever it takes.

00:04:37.622 --> 00:04:41.061
I'm not just gonna sit here and
let the world come to an end.

00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:43.935
Then we'll need the Hero.

00:04:43.968 --> 00:04:45.436
To rally our forces...

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.009
and lead us all onto
the battlefield.

00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:49.512
Yes!

00:04:49.546 --> 00:04:51.049
After Dai wakes up,

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:54.054
he could give the soldiers
a speech to boost morale.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.292
You're right.

00:04:56.325 --> 00:04:57.629
If people hear it from him,

00:04:57.662 --> 00:05:00.433
they'll definitely be
willing to keep fighting.

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:01.736
He'll inspire them.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.007
Merle: Yes, seeing the Hero
will give everyone hope.

00:05:05.311 --> 00:05:06.413
Nova: You're right.

00:05:06.446 --> 00:05:08.985
Maam: His courage
always gives us a boost.

00:05:09.018 --> 00:05:09.819
Popp: Yeah.

00:05:09.853 --> 00:05:11.523
Dai [thought]:
I don't believe it.

00:05:11.556 --> 00:05:14.696
Everyone just wants me to
fight - after what we saw?

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:17.400
Leona: I'll go check
on him, see if he's up.

00:05:19.873 --> 00:05:21.510
Chiu: What do
you think, Gomechan?

00:05:21.544 --> 00:05:23.815
Pretty great, right?

00:05:23.848 --> 00:05:24.683
The Beast King Commandos

00:05:24.716 --> 00:05:27.487
are starting to
look like a proper army.

00:05:27.521 --> 00:05:30.895
We're up to ten
whole members now!

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:34.502
[confused chirp]

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:43.319
Something's wrong.

00:05:43.353 --> 00:05:44.990
I can't find Dai anywhere!

00:05:45.023 --> 00:05:46.593
Wait - what?!

00:05:52.838 --> 00:05:53.975
Dai [thought]:
Why does everyone

00:05:54.008 --> 00:05:57.080
keep expecting me
to do the impossible?

00:05:57.114 --> 00:06:01.489
[weeping]

00:06:01.523 --> 00:06:03.961
Dai [thought]: I've
already tried everything...

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.135
I'm just not strong enough...

00:06:09.371 --> 00:06:11.042
Sir Dai!

00:06:11.075 --> 00:06:12.244
Soldier: Sir Hero!

00:06:12.277 --> 00:06:13.380
Soldier: He's not here.

00:06:13.413 --> 00:06:15.785
C'mon. Where are you, Dai?!

00:06:15.818 --> 00:06:16.987
I didn't think...

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.624
He would run away like this.

00:06:18.657 --> 00:06:20.160
You mustn't blame him.

00:06:20.193 --> 00:06:22.130
He's been through too much.

00:06:22.164 --> 00:06:24.536
Flora: He just
lost his own father.

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:27.542
And that sword- it was
an extension of his soul.

00:06:27.575 --> 00:06:29.378
Leona: If that's
what's bothering him...

00:06:29.411 --> 00:06:31.950
then why didn't he talk to us?

00:06:31.984 --> 00:06:34.722
Flora: Because he still
doesn't entirely understand

00:06:34.756 --> 00:06:36.325
the source of his torment.

00:06:36.359 --> 00:06:37.662
Huh?

00:06:37.695 --> 00:06:40.701
Dai did not run because
he's afraid to keep fighting.

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:44.141
What he fears is the
weight of his title...

00:06:44.175 --> 00:06:45.711
and not knowing
if he's able to

00:06:45.744 --> 00:06:47.982
live up to the
calling of a Hero.

00:06:49.118 --> 00:06:50.621
But as cruel as it sounds...

00:06:50.655 --> 00:06:55.197
If he can't overcome himself,
then he's not a true Hero.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.733
No. You're wrong.

00:06:57.802 --> 00:06:59.906
He is a Hero.

00:07:08.591 --> 00:07:09.959
Popp: You startled me.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.730
What's going on?

00:07:11.763 --> 00:07:14.836
We don't stand a chance here.

00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:18.209
I can't believe Dai would
actually abandon us.

00:07:19.178 --> 00:07:20.648
Gomechan: [saddened chirp]

00:07:24.021 --> 00:07:25.724
Wow, what a twist.

00:07:25.758 --> 00:07:29.532
We've got "The Brave Having
a Breakdown, Part Two".

00:07:29.565 --> 00:07:34.175
I never expected to see you
go all fragile and weepy.

00:07:34.208 --> 00:07:36.245
That was my specialty.

00:07:36.278 --> 00:07:39.017
Idiot. Not the time for jokes!

00:07:42.191 --> 00:07:46.131
It'll be okay. You'll see.

00:07:46.165 --> 00:07:49.104
Me, for example:
Danger ahead?

00:07:49.138 --> 00:07:52.210
I was always the first
to run away, wasn't I?

00:07:52.243 --> 00:07:54.782
But I kept coming
back. Even now.

00:07:56.653 --> 00:07:58.590
So, just take it easy.

00:07:58.623 --> 00:08:00.894
I know Dai is
going to turn up.

00:08:00.928 --> 00:08:02.965
We need to have
a little faith.

00:08:03.534 --> 00:08:04.936
I'll try.

00:08:05.336 --> 00:08:06.338
We've got this.

00:08:06.372 --> 00:08:07.975
I'm gonna go keep looking.

00:08:11.315 --> 00:08:13.119
Akhim: He must've
used a Zoom spell.

00:08:13.152 --> 00:08:16.325
It's the only thing I can
think of that explains it.

00:08:16.359 --> 00:08:18.229
Zoom, huh?

00:08:28.617 --> 00:08:31.990
Dai [thought]: So,
I'm in... Teran Kingdom.

00:08:32.023 --> 00:08:33.961
Boy: Hear me,
God of Dragons...

00:08:33.994 --> 00:08:38.169
Please, send the mighty
Hero to defeat the Dark King!

00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:43.714
He's the only
one who can save us.

00:08:43.747 --> 00:08:47.688
Dai [thought]: I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry...

00:08:47.721 --> 00:08:50.528
But I can't answer
your prayers.

00:08:50.561 --> 00:08:53.499
The Holy Mother Dragon
told me herself:

00:08:53.534 --> 00:08:56.271
King Vearn is
stronger than a god.

00:08:56.305 --> 00:09:00.881
Nobody can stop him
- not even me.

00:09:08.062 --> 00:09:09.899
What should I...

00:09:11.201 --> 00:09:13.306
What can I do?

00:09:13.339 --> 00:09:18.950
[crying]

00:09:23.694 --> 00:09:25.698
Popp: You know,
if you ask me...

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:27.568
Crying isn't
really your style.

00:09:41.228 --> 00:09:42.163
You're here...

00:09:43.032 --> 00:09:44.769
Let's take a walk.

00:09:44.802 --> 00:09:48.275
Seems like a great time to
see some moonlight, huh?

00:10:10.087 --> 00:10:13.793
Dai: Tell me... How did
you know I'd be here?

00:10:14.996 --> 00:10:15.664
[chuckling]

00:10:15.697 --> 00:10:17.668
Hey, now. Don't forget, buddy.

00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:20.040
I've been with you since
the very beginning,

00:10:20.073 --> 00:10:23.312
all the way back when we
first met on Dermline Island.

00:10:23.346 --> 00:10:27.522
So there's no place you can go
that I haven't been before...

00:10:27.555 --> 00:10:28.990
And remember;

00:10:29.024 --> 00:10:33.032
Zoom spells can only take the
caster places they've been to.

00:10:34.168 --> 00:10:35.370
Also...

00:10:35.403 --> 00:10:38.142
Back when I was still learning
how to cast a Zoom spell...

00:10:38.175 --> 00:10:42.250
I kept landing in a place
that was important to me.

00:10:42.284 --> 00:10:45.389
It was the Dark Forest
where we first met Maam.

00:10:47.193 --> 00:10:49.732
So I figured if
you flew off randomly,

00:10:49.765 --> 00:10:52.505
then the same thing would
probably happen to you.

00:10:52.539 --> 00:10:54.041
Anyway...

00:10:54.075 --> 00:10:55.945
This is where you
first met your dad.

00:10:55.978 --> 00:10:58.048
So, it seemed like a good bet.

00:11:01.255 --> 00:11:03.092
Dai: Why aren't you mad?

00:11:04.295 --> 00:11:05.731
Dai: I...

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:09.271
I ran away on you guys!

00:11:09.304 --> 00:11:14.014
And right when we all should've
been working together!

00:11:14.047 --> 00:11:18.289
Even though I know Hyunckel
and Crocodine still need us...

00:11:18.322 --> 00:11:22.030
I... I abandoned the battle.

00:11:25.169 --> 00:11:27.908
You should be yelling
at me right now.

00:11:27.941 --> 00:11:30.480
"You call yourself
a Hero, Dai?"

00:11:30.514 --> 00:11:32.250
"You're just a coward."

00:11:34.487 --> 00:11:36.759
A coward? C'mon.

00:11:36.793 --> 00:11:40.366
How could I, of all people,
judge someone for that?

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.703
When it comes to running,

00:11:41.737 --> 00:11:43.172
I have got way
more experience

00:11:43.206 --> 00:11:45.611
than everyone in
the party combined.

00:11:45.645 --> 00:11:48.016
[laughing]

00:11:48.049 --> 00:11:51.122
Dai, nobody
blames you for it.

00:11:51.155 --> 00:11:53.928
You fought as hard
as you could have.

00:11:53.961 --> 00:11:55.698
Baran might be gone...

00:11:55.732 --> 00:11:57.768
And your sword, too.

00:11:58.469 --> 00:12:00.774
But you did...

00:12:00.808 --> 00:12:02.377
The best you could.

00:12:02.411 --> 00:12:04.080
But my best wasn't enough!

00:12:14.936 --> 00:12:17.341
Dai: Even with all this power,

00:12:17.374 --> 00:12:20.814
It was nothing up
against the Dark King.

00:12:21.816 --> 00:12:23.453
Now dad's gone...

00:12:23.486 --> 00:12:25.489
And I let you get hurt.

00:12:28.864 --> 00:12:33.439
You know, I used to think
that Heroes were so cool.

00:12:33.473 --> 00:12:37.014
I... I wanted to
be one so badly.

00:12:37.047 --> 00:12:39.251
But then I met Leona,

00:12:39.284 --> 00:12:42.625
and started training with
you and Master Avan...

00:12:42.658 --> 00:12:45.897
and everyone started
calling me the Hero.

00:12:47.133 --> 00:12:49.238
I didn't want to
let you all down,

00:12:49.271 --> 00:12:52.377
so I tried to get
as strong as I could.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:58.824
But... But all my power
still wasn't enough-

00:12:58.857 --> 00:13:00.994
not against King Vearn.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:07.274
And somehow, you all still
think I can do something.

00:13:07.307 --> 00:13:10.614
Everybody still
believes I'm a real Hero.

00:13:10.648 --> 00:13:14.021
But the truth is, I'm not.

00:13:14.054 --> 00:13:18.129
If you all continue to fight,
believing in me...

00:13:18.162 --> 00:13:21.903
You're just... going
to end up like Dad...

00:13:23.473 --> 00:13:26.445
All of you, Popp. I can't.

00:13:28.883 --> 00:13:32.123
Okay then. I won't
try to argue.

00:13:34.494 --> 00:13:36.232
But even if you won't,

00:13:36.265 --> 00:13:39.404
I'm still going to fight
the Dark King again.

00:13:39.438 --> 00:13:40.841
Dai: Huh?

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:44.516
Popp: You've always
been strong, Dai.

00:13:44.549 --> 00:13:45.884
But not me.

00:13:45.918 --> 00:13:48.356
I used to be scared
of the strong guys

00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:50.561
and was always running.

00:13:50.595 --> 00:13:52.230
But look at me now,

00:13:52.263 --> 00:13:55.470
picking a fight with the God
of the Underworld himself.

00:13:55.505 --> 00:13:57.040
Kinda crazy, right?

00:13:57.908 --> 00:13:59.144
Yeah, but...

00:13:59.177 --> 00:14:02.685
I know I've never been
Hero material, but still.

00:14:02.718 --> 00:14:04.789
Making it this
far with you and Maam

00:14:04.822 --> 00:14:06.760
and everyone we
met along the way?

00:14:06.793 --> 00:14:09.131
That's the thing
I'm most proud of.

00:14:09.164 --> 00:14:12.337
So, if I quit here,
then all of my training,

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:14.943
all that fighting I barely
had the courage for.

00:14:14.976 --> 00:14:18.516
All of it would have amounted
to nothing in the end.

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.190
Dai, up until this moment,

00:14:22.223 --> 00:14:25.497
you and I have fought for
the sake of everybody else.

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:28.035
To avenge our Master Avan...

00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:31.743
And to protect our families
from the Dark Army...

00:14:31.777 --> 00:14:34.549
We are going to keep
fighting for them.

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:36.384
But there's another reason.

00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:40.226
It's not just for the world,
it's about who we are.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.631
We need to fight
for ourselves.

00:14:43.499 --> 00:14:45.737
For ourselves? Really?

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:47.174
Popp: You bet.

00:14:47.207 --> 00:14:50.446
This is our fight now -
and we can win it.

00:14:51.482 --> 00:14:54.487
Dai [thought]: This is...
This is our fight.

00:14:54.522 --> 00:14:57.426
Popp: You're gonna have
to decide for yourself.

00:14:59.966 --> 00:15:01.969
But I won't give up.

00:15:03.306 --> 00:15:04.375
Popp, I...

00:15:04.408 --> 00:15:07.514
Popp: I believe in
you because I know you.

00:15:07.548 --> 00:15:10.921
I don't care if you're
the real Hero or not.

00:15:10.954 --> 00:15:14.227
Don't you get it?
That's not the point.

00:15:15.496 --> 00:15:17.100
Forget the Hero stuff.

00:15:17.133 --> 00:15:19.705
Forget about
the Dragon Knights.

00:15:22.979 --> 00:15:27.086
For me... Just being
Dai is enough.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.504
Dai [thought]:
What should I do?

00:15:37.107 --> 00:15:39.679
Why am I even asking?

00:15:39.712 --> 00:15:42.283
There's only
one thing I can do.

00:15:55.811 --> 00:15:57.882
[worried chatter]

00:15:57.915 --> 00:15:59.552
Without the Hero,
we're finished.

00:15:59.586 --> 00:16:02.490
C'mon. I thought you
said he'd be here.

00:16:03.661 --> 00:16:05.095
Flora: Settle down.

00:16:08.101 --> 00:16:09.170
We have a guest.

00:16:09.204 --> 00:16:11.108
The stage is yours.

00:16:11.142 --> 00:16:12.511
[surprised breaths]

00:16:18.924 --> 00:16:22.063
Soldier: [cheering]

00:16:24.467 --> 00:16:27.440
So, uh - I had
to clear my head.

00:16:27.474 --> 00:16:29.745
Dai: I'm sorry
I worried everyone.

00:16:30.647 --> 00:16:35.089
Listen... King Vearn
is really powerful.

00:16:35.123 --> 00:16:36.859
The Holy Mother
Dragon told me

00:16:36.892 --> 00:16:39.397
he might be
stronger than a god.

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:41.368
I can't stand
here and say that

00:16:41.402 --> 00:16:44.642
if we fight him
we're going to win.

00:16:44.675 --> 00:16:46.846
I'm not as strong as him...

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.050
And I don't have
a secret weapon.

00:16:49.084 --> 00:16:50.887
But I also can't
just sit back

00:16:50.921 --> 00:16:53.425
and watch while he
destroys our world-

00:16:53.459 --> 00:16:55.597
otherwise,
he's already won.

00:16:56.733 --> 00:17:01.075
And there's still one weapon
that we do have here...

00:17:01.108 --> 00:17:03.445
The hope in our hearts.

00:17:05.651 --> 00:17:08.690
Dai: So, if you'll
all follow my lead...

00:17:08.724 --> 00:17:10.961
then let's keep
that hope alive.

00:17:10.995 --> 00:17:15.737
[cheering]

00:17:15.771 --> 00:17:16.672
Well said!

00:17:16.706 --> 00:17:18.643
[cheering]

00:17:18.677 --> 00:17:20.547
[laughing]

00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:22.852
[cheering]

00:17:22.885 --> 00:17:24.153
Popp: Hey...

00:17:26.491 --> 00:17:27.794
Look who it is.

00:17:29.866 --> 00:17:31.569
Better late than never.

00:17:31.603 --> 00:17:35.510
[laughing]

00:17:42.892 --> 00:17:44.227
Flora: Tomorrow at noon,

00:17:44.261 --> 00:17:47.801
we'll move out to rescue
Hyunckel and Crocodine.

00:17:47.834 --> 00:17:49.638
We'll be walking into a trap,

00:17:49.672 --> 00:17:52.310
so we'll have to prepare
a surprise of our own.

00:17:52.343 --> 00:17:54.616
In order to do that,
one of us must learn

00:17:54.649 --> 00:17:58.089
the Great Purification
Spell, Kaglimmer.

00:17:58.122 --> 00:17:59.658
Popp: What does it do?

00:17:59.692 --> 00:18:03.600
It's a more powerful version
of Avan's Glimmer spell.

00:18:03.633 --> 00:18:06.706
It can bind the
Magic Power of Darklings.

00:18:06.739 --> 00:18:08.008
[amazed breath]

00:18:08.042 --> 00:18:10.046
Flora: You said Vearn
Palace is surrounded by

00:18:10.079 --> 00:18:11.850
a protective barrier?

00:18:11.883 --> 00:18:13.118
Yeah.

00:18:13.151 --> 00:18:15.757
It prevents us from using
Zoom spells to get in.

00:18:15.791 --> 00:18:18.062
If the Kaglimmer
actually works,

00:18:18.095 --> 00:18:20.066
it should take
down the barrier,

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:22.671
and we'll be able to Zoom in.

00:18:22.704 --> 00:18:24.041
That's great!

00:18:24.074 --> 00:18:26.078
Flora: But even Avan himself

00:18:26.111 --> 00:18:29.084
couldn't master
this incantation.

00:18:29.117 --> 00:18:32.157
But if he couldn't
cast it, then who can?

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:34.194
Only his fifth disciple.

00:18:34.228 --> 00:18:36.164
Popp: Whoa, hold on!

00:18:37.968 --> 00:18:39.471
Your Majesty...

00:18:39.505 --> 00:18:41.375
Sorry to argue, it's just...

00:18:41.408 --> 00:18:43.513
Avan gave each
of us an insignia.

00:18:43.546 --> 00:18:46.084
Each of his
disciples got one...

00:18:46.117 --> 00:18:48.388
And there's only four of them!

00:18:50.927 --> 00:18:54.367
[amazed breaths]

00:18:56.371 --> 00:18:58.242
Dai: They're the same.

00:18:58.275 --> 00:19:00.145
That's an Insignia of Avan!

00:19:00.179 --> 00:19:03.251
So... the fifth
Disciple is you?

00:19:03.285 --> 00:19:04.855
Flora: Insignias
are made from

00:19:04.888 --> 00:19:07.093
a precious stone
called Mysticite.

00:19:07.127 --> 00:19:09.599
They're polished and
imbued with magic.

00:19:09.632 --> 00:19:12.270
Only Avan's family
knew how to make them.

00:19:12.303 --> 00:19:15.276
A skill passed down
from each generation.

00:19:15.309 --> 00:19:16.478
And here they are.

00:19:16.512 --> 00:19:18.348
Filled with pure holy power.

00:19:18.382 --> 00:19:21.021
Made to repel dark energy.

00:19:21.054 --> 00:19:23.191
They're powerful charms.

00:19:24.361 --> 00:19:26.800
Wait a sec. That means...

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:28.737
So... All this time...

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:29.706
Flora: Yes.

00:19:29.739 --> 00:19:32.042
These Insignias have
given you protection

00:19:32.076 --> 00:19:34.648
through every
one of your battles.

00:19:35.617 --> 00:19:37.453
Popp [thought]:
Incredible...

00:19:38.188 --> 00:19:40.760
I never even considered it.

00:19:42.296 --> 00:19:46.338
Maam [thought]: Master...
Master Avan was always...

00:19:46.371 --> 00:19:49.545
Dai [thought]: He's been
watching over us all this time.

00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:52.784
Popp: How about that.

00:19:52.818 --> 00:19:55.089
I had assumed that
we made it this far

00:19:55.122 --> 00:19:57.861
on our own strength, but...

00:19:57.895 --> 00:20:00.701
If he hadn't given us
these Insignias, who knows?

00:20:00.734 --> 00:20:04.240
It's possible we wouldn't
even be here without them.

00:20:04.875 --> 00:20:05.778
Avan.

00:20:05.811 --> 00:20:08.182
He's always been lending
us his strength...

00:20:08.215 --> 00:20:09.651
What a hero.

00:20:13.793 --> 00:20:18.335
Flora: Avan gave me this charm
as a way to remember him.

00:20:18.368 --> 00:20:21.408
Later on, he came up
with the idea of giving one

00:20:21.441 --> 00:20:25.617
to each of his students
to mark their graduation.

00:20:27.153 --> 00:20:28.589
Princess Leona?

00:20:28.623 --> 00:20:30.627
Uh - Yes?

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:35.102
For this; I request you take
my place as the fifth disciple.

00:20:35.135 --> 00:20:36.471
Are you sure?

00:20:36.506 --> 00:20:40.246
Of course, and I believe that
Avan would agree with me.

00:20:40.279 --> 00:20:42.517
You very clearly have
the potential needed

00:20:42.551 --> 00:20:44.989
to master the
Kaglimmer spell.

00:20:45.022 --> 00:20:46.559
However, you will
have to perform

00:20:46.592 --> 00:20:49.932
a dangerous rite to
prove yourself first.

00:20:49.966 --> 00:20:51.836
What?! But, Leona...

00:20:51.869 --> 00:20:54.808
Flora: Do you accept
this challenge, Princess?

00:20:57.515 --> 00:20:58.482
Yes.

00:20:58.516 --> 00:21:00.787
Whoa - slow down.
This is crazy!

00:21:00.821 --> 00:21:03.894
Leona: You're not going
to change my mind, Dai.

00:21:03.927 --> 00:21:07.868
To be honest, I've needed
this for a while...

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:11.274
I've always felt like
a bit of an outsider

00:21:11.307 --> 00:21:14.615
next to the three of you,
and it's frustrating.

00:21:14.648 --> 00:21:18.623
I should be fighting alongside
you, like Popp and Maam.

00:21:18.657 --> 00:21:22.564
So, I accept - no matter
what the challenge is.

00:21:22.597 --> 00:21:28.142
And once I overcome it, we'll
take on King Vearn together.

00:21:28.175 --> 00:21:29.845
Just wait and see.

00:21:36.024 --> 00:21:37.961
[cheering]

00:21:37.995 --> 00:21:39.030
Very well.

00:21:39.063 --> 00:21:41.835
Your challenge is to
brave the Cave of Trials...

00:21:41.869 --> 00:21:45.176
A natural labyrinth,
teeming with fearsome monsters.

00:21:45.209 --> 00:21:48.917
It's the only place you can
bind with the Kaglimmer spell.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:50.253
Okay.

00:21:50.286 --> 00:21:51.589
But...

00:21:51.622 --> 00:21:53.793
can I really become a Disciple
of Avan like the others?

00:21:53.827 --> 00:21:56.599
I mean, he was never
even my teacher!

00:21:56.633 --> 00:21:58.234
Would it be helpful for me

00:21:58.268 --> 00:22:01.007
