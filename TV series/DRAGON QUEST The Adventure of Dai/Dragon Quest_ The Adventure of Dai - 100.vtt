WEBVTT

00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:18.771
[roaring]

00:00:21.611 --> 00:00:22.712
Dai: [pained grunt]

00:00:29.358 --> 00:00:30.862
Dai [thought]:
I need my sword...

00:00:30.895 --> 00:00:33.032
[menacing cackle]

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:33.968
Dai [thought]: Without it,

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:35.671
I'm never gonna
beat this thing.

00:00:55.545 --> 00:00:56.613
Get up!

00:00:59.218 --> 00:01:00.454
I've done it.

00:01:00.487 --> 00:01:03.226
Victory is mine.
Nothing stands in my way!

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:10.975
[delighted laugh]

00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:12.411
Having said that,

00:01:12.445 --> 00:01:15.417
there could always be
another miracle on its way.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.522
Which means this
won't really be finished

00:01:17.556 --> 00:01:20.761
until Dai is beyond all
hope of resurrection.

00:01:33.186 --> 00:01:34.622
That's the...

00:01:37.128 --> 00:01:39.465
Demon Dragon Blade?!

00:03:26.145 --> 00:03:27.649
True Vearn: Yes,
there's no mistaking it...

00:03:27.682 --> 00:03:30.755
But how? It was lost
when Baran met his demise.

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:34.062
Dai couldn't summon
the blade himself.

00:03:34.095 --> 00:03:35.731
What's it doing here?

00:03:43.012 --> 00:03:44.516
The sun's rising?

00:04:06.594 --> 00:04:08.496
Dai [thought]:
Mom, it's you...

00:04:13.507 --> 00:04:15.511
Wait... That's Dad's sword!

00:04:16.078 --> 00:04:17.549
Indeed it is.

00:04:17.582 --> 00:04:20.855
The rightful weapon
of a true Dragon Knight.

00:04:20.888 --> 00:04:22.558
Now, you must wield it, son.

00:04:22.592 --> 00:04:24.128
Take this sword,
strike him down,

00:04:24.162 --> 00:04:26.398
and fulfill your destiny.

00:04:27.468 --> 00:04:28.537
Dai: It must've just been

00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:30.207
sunshine reflecting
off the blade...

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.209
But for a second,

00:04:31.242 --> 00:04:33.246
I swear I saw Mom
standing there.

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:34.583
Soala was a woman
whose spirit

00:04:34.616 --> 00:04:36.954
shone as brightly as the sun.

00:04:36.987 --> 00:04:38.323
She lit up any room and

00:04:38.357 --> 00:04:41.062
embraced everyone
she met with warmth.

00:04:41.095 --> 00:04:42.364
Now, my son...

00:04:42.398 --> 00:04:45.337
It's up to you to shine
even brighter than she did.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.809
To be the light that
illuminates your friends...

00:04:47.842 --> 00:04:50.481
and banishes this darkness
from the Surface World.

00:04:50.515 --> 00:04:52.317
Brighter than the sun?

00:04:52.786 --> 00:04:54.923
[snarling]

00:04:54.956 --> 00:04:55.892
Baran: Here he comes...

00:04:55.925 --> 00:04:57.728
Hurry, grab it!

00:04:57.762 --> 00:04:59.566
You'll only have
one chance at this.

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:02.137
Even a blade as
legendary as mine

00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:04.141
cannot endure
repeated strikes...

00:05:04.174 --> 00:05:05.611
Especially
with the full power

00:05:05.644 --> 00:05:08.584
of the Dragonoid
form behind them.

00:05:09.653 --> 00:05:11.957
[roaring]

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.759
Baran: This is it.

00:05:12.792 --> 00:05:14.328
Summon everything
you have left,

00:05:14.361 --> 00:05:16.432
and let my spirit
fortify you...

00:05:16.465 --> 00:05:18.871
And destroy his
Sovereign Eye for good!

00:05:20.207 --> 00:05:21.710
Baran: Finish this, Dai.

00:05:28.591 --> 00:05:31.830
Dai [thought]: I-I guess...

00:05:31.863 --> 00:05:34.937
I guess this is
goodbye, everyone.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.272
With this last strike,

00:05:36.305 --> 00:05:38.644
I'll shine even
brighter than the sun!

00:05:38.677 --> 00:05:40.715
I'll light up the
sky as a sign that

00:05:40.748 --> 00:05:43.486
the Dark King's been
beaten once and for all.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:56.245
I promise I'll
give this everything...

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:58.584
[roaring]

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:04.729
[roaring]

00:06:10.742 --> 00:06:17.755
[roaring]

00:06:20.795 --> 00:06:28.677
[roaring]

00:06:33.954 --> 00:06:39.933
[straining grunt]

00:06:39.967 --> 00:06:41.803
[roaring]

00:06:48.216 --> 00:06:49.886
[laughing]

00:06:54.195 --> 00:06:57.133
[cackling]

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.443
[roaring]

00:07:18.476 --> 00:07:27.227
[anguished cries]

00:07:29.833 --> 00:07:32.103
[gasping]

00:07:32.137 --> 00:07:33.139
P-Popp...

00:07:33.173 --> 00:07:35.511
[gasping]

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.618
Popp: Even if it
doesn't change a thing,

00:07:38.651 --> 00:07:40.187
we'll keep struggling!

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.623
Forget easy!

00:07:41.656 --> 00:07:44.261
We put all of our might into
living until the last breath!

00:07:44.294 --> 00:07:46.365
It may only be for
an instant to you,

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:49.773
but like a bright flash...

00:07:49.806 --> 00:07:52.511
we'll burn as
brilliant as the sun.

00:07:56.119 --> 00:07:57.087
[roaring]

00:07:57.121 --> 00:07:59.926
Dai [thought]: I'll go
out like a bright flash!

00:08:01.563 --> 00:08:04.869
[roaring]

00:08:10.113 --> 00:08:13.085
[roaring]

00:08:18.898 --> 00:08:19.999
[roaring]

00:08:29.318 --> 00:08:34.796
[roaring]

00:08:37.902 --> 00:08:42.277
[anguished cry]

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.189
[sputtering]

00:08:48.223 --> 00:08:56.740
[roaring]

00:09:14.174 --> 00:09:16.212
Dai [thought]:
He always wanted the sun.

00:09:16.245 --> 00:09:17.948
Goodbye, Vearn.

00:09:48.543 --> 00:09:50.146
You okay, Leona?

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.918
Yeah. I thought I saw
something in the sky.

00:09:55.056 --> 00:09:55.691
Maam: [gasping]

00:09:55.724 --> 00:09:56.693
I see it too.

00:09:56.726 --> 00:09:58.129
Wait, do you think that's Dai?

00:09:58.162 --> 00:10:00.366
Whatever it is,
it's falling pretty quick.

00:10:01.737 --> 00:10:03.139
Chiu: It's Dai, alright...

00:10:03.173 --> 00:10:04.308
Looks like he's out cold!

00:10:04.341 --> 00:10:05.645
You mean he's in free fall?!

00:10:05.678 --> 00:10:07.582
At this rate,
even if he woke up...

00:10:07.615 --> 00:10:08.416
He'll crash.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:09.952
Not if we catch him first.

00:10:10.588 --> 00:10:12.491
Maam: Go get him, Popp!

00:10:12.525 --> 00:10:14.495
Popp [thought]: I will -
this one's mine.

00:10:14.529 --> 00:10:16.700
Nobody gets to save
this knucklehead but me!

00:10:16.733 --> 00:10:19.404
Hang on, Dai!

00:10:28.355 --> 00:10:29.659
[relieved sighs]

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.969
Aw, ow, ow...

00:10:40.347 --> 00:10:41.683
Dai?

00:10:51.268 --> 00:10:53.072
You did it, right? You won?

00:10:54.041 --> 00:10:56.078
I didn't...

00:10:56.112 --> 00:10:59.217
We all did.
The Dark King is gone.

00:10:59.251 --> 00:11:00.787
I knew it!

00:11:02.992 --> 00:11:04.027
Is it bad?

00:11:04.061 --> 00:11:05.096
Huh?

00:11:05.129 --> 00:11:07.401
I mean, am I a hideous beast?
I must look weird.

00:11:07.434 --> 00:11:08.570
Uh, "weird"?

00:11:08.604 --> 00:11:11.275
C'mon, Popp. Am I,
you know... all Dragon-y?

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.651
Popp: Well, let's see.
The wild hair...

00:11:15.684 --> 00:11:17.087
Popp: The scars all over...

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.860
Plus the desperate
need for a hot bath...

00:11:19.893 --> 00:11:21.428
Nothing out of the ordinary,

00:11:21.461 --> 00:11:22.799
nothing dragon-y
about you, either.

00:11:22.832 --> 00:11:24.502
You're still Dai.

00:11:24.535 --> 00:11:25.872
That's right.

00:11:25.905 --> 00:11:27.809
Dai beat the Dark King!

00:11:27.842 --> 00:11:30.479
Give it up for the Hero!

00:11:30.514 --> 00:11:40.534
[laughing]

00:11:40.568 --> 00:11:48.517
[laughing]

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:49.953
All right, on your feet, pal.

00:11:49.986 --> 00:11:51.856
It's time to make
your triumphant return.

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:53.727
Everyone's been
waiting for you.

00:11:53.761 --> 00:11:55.129
Enjoy it!

00:12:02.545 --> 00:12:04.248
Welcome back, Dai.

00:12:04.281 --> 00:12:10.293
[chuckling]

00:12:10.326 --> 00:12:12.932
[chattering]

00:12:12.965 --> 00:12:15.504
We really pulled
if off, didn't we?

00:12:15.537 --> 00:12:18.643
To victory. To Dai, the Hero!

00:12:18.677 --> 00:12:23.385
[cheering]

00:12:37.849 --> 00:12:38.850
Dai [thought]: What now?

00:12:38.884 --> 00:12:40.319
I told Vearn I'd
leave this world if

00:12:40.353 --> 00:12:43.025
people didn't want me
around after I defeated him.

00:12:43.058 --> 00:12:44.562
Leona: How are
you feeling, Dai?

00:12:44.595 --> 00:12:45.898
You're not hurt
anywhere, are you?

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:47.702
Do you need a Fullheal?

00:12:47.735 --> 00:12:48.503
Gee, thanks.

00:12:48.536 --> 00:12:49.672
Maybe next time

00:12:49.705 --> 00:12:51.408
go with that before
everybody dog-piles me.

00:12:51.442 --> 00:12:54.816
[laughing]

00:12:54.849 --> 00:12:55.985
Dai [thought]:
Thanks, friends...

00:12:56.018 --> 00:12:57.922
Now, Leona...
if you want some advice...

00:12:57.955 --> 00:12:59.257
He might not always enjoy it,

00:12:59.291 --> 00:13:01.530
but make sure you
hold onto this one.

00:13:01.563 --> 00:13:02.798
Be warned, in my experience,

00:13:02.831 --> 00:13:04.134
Heroes have a
tendency to vanish

00:13:04.167 --> 00:13:05.937
the moment they finish the job.

00:13:06.907 --> 00:13:09.178
That sounds a little
irresponsible to me.

00:13:09.211 --> 00:13:10.146
It does.

00:13:10.179 --> 00:13:11.917
Those tables sure have
turned, huh, Master?

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.623
Better just accept it and
take some responsibility.

00:13:14.656 --> 00:13:16.526
She wasn't talking about me!

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.866
[laughing]

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:22.236
That's not something we
have to worry about with you,

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:23.272
right Dai?

00:13:24.108 --> 00:13:26.178
You aren't going
anywhere, right?

00:13:26.211 --> 00:13:28.049
Not if everyone
wants me to stay.

00:13:28.082 --> 00:13:31.221
Honestly, there's
nowhere else I'd rather be.

00:13:33.359 --> 00:13:34.361
Troops!

00:13:34.394 --> 00:13:36.465
I'm sure our heroes
are thoroughly exhausted,

00:13:36.498 --> 00:13:37.568
and need some healing.

00:13:37.602 --> 00:13:38.770
Let's get them patched up.

00:13:38.804 --> 00:13:40.774
After that, we'll
have a proper celebration.

00:13:40.808 --> 00:13:43.613
[cheering]

00:13:45.416 --> 00:13:47.020
Killvearn: Not so fast.

00:13:47.054 --> 00:13:48.991
Before you go, my Queen...

00:13:49.024 --> 00:13:51.428
I must insist on
offering my most sincere

00:13:51.461 --> 00:13:54.502
congratulations for
this stunning victory.

00:14:00.012 --> 00:14:01.582
Popp: Killvearn?!

00:14:03.186 --> 00:14:04.989
Killvearn: Quite a
marvelous spectacle.

00:14:05.023 --> 00:14:07.661
Defeating the most powerful
being in the Underworld,

00:14:07.694 --> 00:14:09.097
and thwarting
the destruction of

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.234
the Surface World
so courageously...

00:14:11.268 --> 00:14:13.907
Or should I say,
miraculously?

00:14:15.443 --> 00:14:16.579
It's impossible!

00:14:17.749 --> 00:14:18.950
I watched you fall.

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:20.453
Even if you were
truly immortal...

00:14:20.486 --> 00:14:22.423
Killvearn: Ah, yes.
How did you put it?

00:14:22.457 --> 00:14:25.797
"No living creature survives
long without its head."

00:14:25.831 --> 00:14:26.867
For what it's worth,

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.335
you could still
be right about that...

00:14:28.369 --> 00:14:30.273
But what you failed
to realize...

00:14:30.306 --> 00:14:35.116
Is that I'm no living
creature at all.

00:14:35.149 --> 00:14:37.220
Killvearn: This body you've
been thinking of as Killvearn

00:14:37.253 --> 00:14:39.157
is actually a
mechanical puppet

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:40.994
I've been controlling in secret.

00:14:41.028 --> 00:14:42.965
For a supposedly
genius warrior,

00:14:42.999 --> 00:14:44.869
you're very easily fooled.

00:14:44.903 --> 00:14:47.040
Oh, was I?

00:14:47.074 --> 00:14:49.979
Avan: I never said those
words to you, Reaper.

00:14:51.214 --> 00:14:52.885
I said them to the little imp

00:14:52.918 --> 00:14:55.389
who rides around
on your shoulders.

00:15:00.568 --> 00:15:02.204
Piroro: One and the same.

00:15:02.237 --> 00:15:04.976
I'm surprised it's taken
you so long to put it together.

00:15:05.009 --> 00:15:08.049
I am the real Reaper.

00:15:08.082 --> 00:15:10.486
Now, it looks like
I do have you fooled.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.958
It's more or less the same
trick used by ventriloquists

00:15:12.991 --> 00:15:15.631
of your world, only
I've reversed the roles.

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:16.800
Simple misdirection.

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:18.803
I played the part of
a servant in order to

00:15:18.836 --> 00:15:20.473
have you believe
that my dummy here

00:15:20.507 --> 00:15:23.312
was the real thing...
and believe you did.

00:15:23.345 --> 00:15:25.149
Therefore, while
my decoy suffered

00:15:25.182 --> 00:15:26.853
what you might call
a splitting headache...

00:15:26.887 --> 00:15:29.658
I've managed to avoid
any damage whatsoever.

00:15:29.692 --> 00:15:30.961
Meanwhile, as you can see,

00:15:30.995 --> 00:15:33.165
the puppet has no
trouble repairing itself.

00:15:33.198 --> 00:15:34.869
There's only
one way to stop it.

00:15:34.902 --> 00:15:37.040
Removing the head
won't do the trick...

00:15:37.074 --> 00:15:39.311
You have to smash
what's inside of it.

00:15:39.344 --> 00:15:42.383
Although, I must say
I'm glad you didn't.

00:15:52.504 --> 00:15:53.506
A Black Core?!

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:54.609
[laughing]

00:15:54.642 --> 00:15:56.178
And that's my secret weapon.

00:15:56.212 --> 00:15:57.213
As you already know,

00:15:57.247 --> 00:15:58.750
if you've been
paying attention...

00:15:58.784 --> 00:16:00.721
My true master is Velzar,

00:16:00.754 --> 00:16:02.725
the great Dragon
King of the Abyss.

00:16:02.758 --> 00:16:04.228
By his decree I served

00:16:04.261 --> 00:16:06.967
the throne of our
mutual friend, Vearn.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.370
However, the real
intention of my mission was

00:16:09.404 --> 00:16:11.308
to wait for the
perfect opportunity

00:16:11.341 --> 00:16:13.212
to assassinate the Dark King.

00:16:13.245 --> 00:16:15.483
Velzar instructed
me to use a Black Core

00:16:15.517 --> 00:16:17.522
to ensure that
when I found my moment,

00:16:17.555 --> 00:16:19.559
it wouldn't be wasted.

00:16:19.592 --> 00:16:20.794
Unlike the Dark King,

00:16:20.827 --> 00:16:23.934
Master Velzar wishes to rule
the Surface World as his own.

00:16:23.967 --> 00:16:25.169
And how does
a guy who's been

00:16:25.203 --> 00:16:27.474
turned to stone plan
to rule the world?

00:16:27.508 --> 00:16:28.543
Why should I care?

00:16:28.576 --> 00:16:31.381
All I do know is,
my lord is a very greedy one.

00:16:31.415 --> 00:16:32.918
When it comes
to his temperament,

00:16:32.952 --> 00:16:35.390
he's very unlike a Dragon.

00:16:35.423 --> 00:16:38.129
In fact, he's much
more like a human.

00:16:38.162 --> 00:16:40.667
And so, I'd best be off!

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:41.970
I'll return to the Underworld

00:16:42.003 --> 00:16:43.272
and give him the good news.

00:16:43.305 --> 00:16:46.011
I appreciate you taking
care of the Dark King for me,

00:16:46.044 --> 00:16:47.915
but that means that
the strength you wield

00:16:47.949 --> 00:16:49.384
is even greater than his.

00:16:49.417 --> 00:16:51.388
That makes you
far too dangerous.

00:16:51.421 --> 00:16:53.225
So, I'm afraid
I have to detonate

00:16:53.258 --> 00:16:55.664
this Core and
vaporize the lot of you.

00:16:55.698 --> 00:16:56.800
Who knows?

00:16:56.833 --> 00:16:59.872
That frozen Pillar may
just be triggered by the blast.

00:16:59.905 --> 00:17:01.441
[devious chuckle]

00:17:02.343 --> 00:17:03.546
Crackle!

00:17:05.249 --> 00:17:06.752
Whoops. I forgot to mention...

00:17:06.786 --> 00:17:07.921
I've shielded this Core so

00:17:07.954 --> 00:17:10.293
Ice-type spells
won't work on it.

00:17:10.326 --> 00:17:12.497
As they say, no one
escapes the Reaper.

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:15.302
And on that lovely note,
farewell, you fools.

00:17:15.336 --> 00:17:18.208
Thanks for keeping
the Surface World intact!

00:17:25.791 --> 00:17:27.460
Gotta get higher
before it blows!

00:17:27.494 --> 00:17:31.068
[roaring]

00:17:31.101 --> 00:17:33.139
It doesn't matter
what you do now...

00:17:33.172 --> 00:17:36.746
Y-Your friends are
already t-too... late...

00:17:49.639 --> 00:17:50.541
Popp: [grim chuckle]

00:17:50.574 --> 00:17:51.208
Well, here we go.

00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:52.377
We won't have any time left

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:55.215
to get clear of this
before it goes off...

00:17:55.249 --> 00:17:57.120
But I don't mind
going out like this,

00:17:57.153 --> 00:17:58.856
so long as I'm with you, Dai!

00:18:01.361 --> 00:18:04.233
Dai: Sorry, Popp,
but I do mind.

00:18:05.938 --> 00:18:07.206
Wh...

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.734
No, wait! Why would
you do that?! Dai!

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:23.172
Dai [thought]: I hope one
day you can forgive me.

00:18:23.205 --> 00:18:24.642
I couldn't let you do that...

00:18:24.675 --> 00:18:26.979
It's my responsibility
to risk everything

00:18:27.013 --> 00:18:28.950
to protect the
people I love...

00:18:28.984 --> 00:18:31.354
and you're one
of those people.

00:18:33.459 --> 00:18:35.330
This is my burden to carry.

00:18:35.363 --> 00:18:36.966
It's what I inherited...

00:18:36.999 --> 00:18:39.872
It's time to
fulfill my destiny.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:52.564
You idiot, how could you?!

00:18:54.869 --> 00:18:57.440
Please... Come back!

00:19:26.231 --> 00:19:27.934
Brass: Oh, brave Hero...

00:19:27.968 --> 00:19:29.838
Ever since you
saved the world,

00:19:29.872 --> 00:19:31.208
we've searched
high and low for

00:19:31.241 --> 00:19:33.179
a sign that you're
still out there,

00:19:33.212 --> 00:19:34.582
and I hate to say it...

00:19:34.615 --> 00:19:38.122
But in spite of our efforts,
we haven't found a trace.

00:19:38.155 --> 00:19:40.594
Where could you
have gone, my dear boy?

00:19:40.627 --> 00:19:43.733
Dai, know that the
Surface World is safe.

00:19:43.767 --> 00:19:47.140
Everything's still here
thanks to what you did.

00:19:47.173 --> 00:19:49.044
We deactivated the pillars,

00:19:49.077 --> 00:19:50.379
and peace has
finally been restored

00:19:50.413 --> 00:19:52.183
throughout the kingdoms...

00:19:52.216 --> 00:19:53.319
But without you...

00:19:53.352 --> 00:19:55.489
Sometimes it's hard
to remember we won.

00:19:55.524 --> 00:19:56.859
Which is why we come here

00:19:56.892 --> 00:19:59.599
and stare at your sword
like we're... crazy.

00:19:59.632 --> 00:20:02.638
This is exactly
like visiting a grave.

00:20:02.671 --> 00:20:05.109
Leona: Quit being so morbid.
It's not a grave...

00:20:05.142 --> 00:20:06.178
It's a lighthouse!

00:20:06.211 --> 00:20:07.347
Think about it.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.415
Dai's going to need
a way to track us down

00:20:08.449 --> 00:20:10.086
whenever he gets
back, isn't he?

00:20:10.119 --> 00:20:10.921
H-Huh?!

00:20:10.954 --> 00:20:11.790
Wh - what?!

00:20:11.823 --> 00:20:12.624
How can you know that?

00:20:12.658 --> 00:20:14.327
Lon Beruk: Take
a look at the jewel

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.897
set in the hilt of that sword.

00:20:15.931 --> 00:20:18.837
I forged this living weapon
for Dai alone to wield.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.907
It's connected to his spirit.

00:20:20.941 --> 00:20:22.210
If he truly has perished,

00:20:22.243 --> 00:20:24.013
that jewel will
have lost its strength

00:20:24.047 --> 00:20:26.018
and faded along
with his life-force.

00:20:26.051 --> 00:20:28.723
Now... Is that really faded?

00:20:31.095 --> 00:20:32.631
It's still shining!

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:37.173
Popp: He's still...
He's still alive!

00:20:37.207 --> 00:20:38.810
Maam: But where
could he have gone?

00:20:38.843 --> 00:20:39.946
Lon Beruk: I don't know.

00:20:39.979 --> 00:20:40.914
He could be anywhere...

00:20:40.947 --> 00:20:42.918
from Celesta
to the Underworld.

00:20:42.952 --> 00:20:45.590
I suppose.

00:20:45.624 --> 00:20:48.061
Popp: Who cares where he is?
That's not the point.

00:20:48.095 --> 00:20:48.863
Huh?

00:20:48.896 --> 00:20:50.032
If he's alive...

00:20:50.065 --> 00:20:52.103
So long as he's
alive out there...

00:20:52.136 --> 00:20:53.906
One day we'll see him again.

00:20:55.142 --> 00:20:56.445
It's a guarantee.

00:20:56.478 --> 00:20:59.585
I mean, at some point
he'll come looking, right?

00:20:59.618 --> 00:21:02.490
In the meantime,
let's get to work!

00:22:40.988 --> 00:22:41.923
Popp: That's right.

00:22:41.956 --> 00:22:42.891
The world might be safe,

00:22:42.924 --> 00:22:45.763
but we've still got
plenty of work to do.

00:22:46.832 --> 00:22:49.303
Maam: We're lost again,
aren't we, Popp?

00:22:49.337 --> 00:22:50.807
Are you holding
that the right way?

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.911
I only had it
upside-down for a sec...

00:22:52.944 --> 00:22:54.147
"Upside-down"?!

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.517
Ah... We're good.
It's this way.

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:56.919
Popp: We'll on keep looking,

00:22:56.953 --> 00:23:00.058
and we'll keep protecting
the world while he's away, too.

00:23:02.564 --> 00:23:06.037
Popp: Then someday, whether
we end up finding him...

00:23:06.371 --> 00:23:07.240
Let's go.

00:23:07.273 --> 00:23:08.776
Uh-huh.

00:23:10.412 --> 00:23:13.018
Popp: Or he ends up
coming back on his own...

00:23:13.051 --> 00:23:13.954
Little Hym, hurry it up!

00:23:13.987 --> 00:23:16.058
The Commandos are
all building a new fort.

00:23:16.091 --> 00:23:17.427
Give us a hand, will ya?

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:18.462
Cut me some slack.

00:23:18.495 --> 00:23:20.032
I'm retired, remember?

00:23:20.066 --> 00:23:21.602
[laughing]

00:23:21.635 --> 00:23:23.238
Popp: He'll see
the beautiful kingdoms

00:23:23.272 --> 00:23:25.175
and towns we've rebuilt...

00:23:25.209 --> 00:23:26.445
[weeping]

00:23:26.478 --> 00:23:27.848
You jackals think
you're fooling me?

00:23:27.881 --> 00:23:30.319
All the loot on the
table or I'll Zapple you.

00:23:30.352 --> 00:23:31.155
[sigh]

00:23:31.188 --> 00:23:32.490
Popp: And all the people

00:23:32.524 --> 00:23:34.728
finally living in
peace like he wanted...

00:23:38.469 --> 00:23:40.138
He can look out
over all of it,

00:23:40.172 --> 00:23:44.414
knowing that this is the world
he fought so hard to save.

00:23:44.447 --> 00:23:45.717
Then from that day on,

00:23:45.751 --> 00:23:48.488
we'll have a legend
living among us.

00:23:50.627 --> 00:23:52.564
So, we'd better keep ready...

00:23:52.598 --> 00:23:54.167
Because when
the Hero does return,

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.540
I'm sure another adventure
won't be far behind.
