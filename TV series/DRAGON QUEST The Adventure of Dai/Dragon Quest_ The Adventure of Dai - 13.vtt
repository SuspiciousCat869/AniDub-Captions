WEBVTT

00:01:51.557 --> 00:01:52.993
Take this!

00:01:53.026 --> 00:01:54.663
Dai: Zapple!

00:01:55.196 --> 00:01:56.566
[pained yell]

00:02:07.121 --> 00:02:08.557
It worked!

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.729
[amazed chuckle]

00:02:10.762 --> 00:02:12.765
Popp: We did it! Hooray!

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.035
[laughing]

00:02:14.068 --> 00:02:15.437
Popp: What'd I tell you, pal?

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.744
His armor's fine, but I bet
he's burnt to a crisp in there.

00:02:20.447 --> 00:02:24.021
Popp: That's what he gets for
underestimating us. Right, Dai?

00:02:24.055 --> 00:02:28.463
[victorious cackle]

00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:31.803
[pained groan]

00:02:31.837 --> 00:02:32.905
No, Popp!

00:02:35.578 --> 00:02:38.551
What happened? Even the
Zapple spell had no effect?!

00:02:38.584 --> 00:02:41.255
No way, it all
went as we planned...

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:44.195
Popp: But somehow he
withstood the damage anyway...

00:02:44.228 --> 00:02:48.269
Even without the armor,
Hyunckel's tough as nails.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.610
Hyunckel: I misjudged you.

00:02:51.644 --> 00:02:54.582
If you're capable of
such a spell,

00:02:54.616 --> 00:02:57.454
then there's no
reason to hold back.

00:02:58.055 --> 00:02:59.526
So here goes.

00:03:00.828 --> 00:03:02.298
Try it one more time!

00:03:02.331 --> 00:03:04.903
Dark Puppetry Aura Hand.

00:03:04.936 --> 00:03:06.406
Zapp...

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:08.744
Not that binding spell again!

00:03:10.414 --> 00:03:11.382
Hyunckel: Good riddance.

00:03:11.415 --> 00:03:13.253
[struggling grunt]

00:03:13.286 --> 00:03:15.423
Bloody Scryde!

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:19.432
Dai [thought]:
We can't beat him...

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:22.304
Not by sword, or by magic...

00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:25.410
Get up!

00:03:28.951 --> 00:03:30.487
It's over.

00:03:33.794 --> 00:03:34.963
[noticing grunt]

00:03:34.997 --> 00:03:37.569
Told you. This must
be our way out.

00:03:37.602 --> 00:03:38.369
[agreeing chirp]

00:03:38.402 --> 00:03:40.875
Popp: C'mon,
just hang in there.

00:03:40.908 --> 00:03:42.144
No, you're not...

00:03:42.177 --> 00:03:45.284
Please - answer me
and get up, Dai!

00:03:45.317 --> 00:03:46.653
Hyunckel: Don't bother.

00:03:46.687 --> 00:03:49.593
Bloody Scryde
is a killing attack.

00:03:49.626 --> 00:03:50.929
He's finished.

00:03:50.962 --> 00:03:52.364
You shut up!

00:03:52.397 --> 00:03:54.636
No, please,
you can't be dead.

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:58.678
This is all my fault.
It was my idea.

00:03:58.711 --> 00:03:59.378
[scoff]

00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:01.483
You'll be with him soon, kid.

00:04:01.517 --> 00:04:03.620
Maam: Hyunckel, wait!

00:04:06.927 --> 00:04:08.898
How did you escape the dungeon?

00:04:08.931 --> 00:04:10.869
Listen, that's enough.

00:04:10.902 --> 00:04:12.304
How could you do this?!

00:04:12.338 --> 00:04:14.910
You attacked another
Disciple of Avan!

00:04:14.943 --> 00:04:17.281
You don't know what
you're talking about.

00:04:17.314 --> 00:04:19.786
You're students
of my father's killer!

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:21.022
You're wrong!

00:04:21.055 --> 00:04:23.962
I'm telling you, Master Avan
wasn't the one who killed him.

00:04:23.995 --> 00:04:25.430
Just spare me the lies!

00:04:25.464 --> 00:04:27.835
But it's the truth!

00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:31.643
Maam: I found this in a
hidden room underground.

00:04:31.676 --> 00:04:34.649
That's a...
That's a Soul Shell.

00:04:34.683 --> 00:04:38.624
Those are made to contain
messages recorded by the dead.

00:04:38.657 --> 00:04:41.195
This one is from your father.

00:04:41.228 --> 00:04:44.368
The Armful that went by
the name Bartos.

00:04:44.401 --> 00:04:47.609
Hyunckel [thought]:
His last words? Impossible!

00:04:47.642 --> 00:04:49.980
How could this exist
without me knowing?

00:04:50.013 --> 00:04:51.182
[distressed chirping]

00:04:51.215 --> 00:04:52.652
This isn't happening.

00:04:52.685 --> 00:04:56.058
I refuse to believe it.
There's no way he's gone!

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:01.068
He's alive!

00:05:05.578 --> 00:05:08.049
Popp [thought]: He avoided
a direct hit to his heart.

00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:11.823
Either he got lucky, or
he leaned back just in time!

00:05:11.856 --> 00:05:13.426
[pained groan]

00:05:14.061 --> 00:05:16.332
We can't... win...

00:05:17.902 --> 00:05:20.207
Dai [thought]: He can't
be beaten by sword.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.278
He can't be beaten by magic.

00:05:22.311 --> 00:05:24.616
That means only one thing...

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:25.818
We lose.

00:05:27.722 --> 00:05:30.260
[pained groan]

00:05:30.294 --> 00:05:31.395
Wake up...

00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:34.301
Maam: Your father
left this behind because

00:05:34.335 --> 00:05:36.540
he wanted you
to hear the truth...

00:05:38.811 --> 00:05:41.081
He wanted you to
know what really happened

00:05:41.115 --> 00:05:43.788
the day this
Underground Palace fell!

00:05:43.821 --> 00:05:46.927
Bartos: Hyunckel...
My son...

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.362
Father?

00:05:51.503 --> 00:05:54.274
Bartos: Hyunckel,
my dear boy...

00:05:54.308 --> 00:05:55.545
I leave this message

00:05:55.578 --> 00:05:57.615
so that you will understand
the circumstances...

00:05:57.648 --> 00:06:00.722
the truth
surrounding my death.

00:06:00.755 --> 00:06:02.692
Bartos: When the
Hero's party attacked

00:06:02.726 --> 00:06:04.261
the Underground Palace...

00:06:04.295 --> 00:06:08.402
Bartos: I fought Avan himself
as the keeper of the Hell Gate.

00:06:09.506 --> 00:06:12.077
But Avan was too strong.

00:06:19.926 --> 00:06:23.700
Bartos: I prepared for
the final blow, but then...

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:29.546
What's wrong?
Strike me down!

00:06:29.579 --> 00:06:30.715
Avan: Let's not do this.

00:06:30.748 --> 00:06:33.954
Come now. Don't shame
me with your mercy.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.795
That medallion you wear

00:06:37.828 --> 00:06:40.200
was clearly made by
the hands of a child.

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:42.470
However unlikely it may be,

00:06:42.505 --> 00:06:45.578
you do have a family
somewhere, yes?

00:06:45.611 --> 00:06:50.186
It's just as I suspected.
I will not harm you.

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:54.395
You've beaten me.

00:06:54.428 --> 00:06:57.501
Not just in strength,
but heart, as well!

00:06:57.535 --> 00:07:00.039
Avan: Now, please...
Open the gate.

00:07:00.073 --> 00:07:03.780
The only one who I've
come here for is Hadlar.

00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:06.352
Bartos: I shall,

00:07:06.385 --> 00:07:08.757
but first I have
something I must ask of you!

00:07:10.528 --> 00:07:12.766
And so, I told him...

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:15.538
How I found and
raised a human child,

00:07:15.571 --> 00:07:17.675
and that even if
he spared my life,

00:07:17.708 --> 00:07:21.516
should Hadlar perish,
I would cease to be.

00:07:22.217 --> 00:07:23.854
Bartos: So, I beg you.

00:07:23.888 --> 00:07:26.726
Look after my son,
Hero Avan.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.066
Raise him to be a strong
and righteous warrior!

00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:34.107
And please, show him
the warmth of a human.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.011
Deal.

00:07:36.513 --> 00:07:37.749
[relieved breath]

00:07:37.782 --> 00:07:41.155
Bartos: With that,
the Hero gracefully accepted.

00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:44.094
Bartos: Then he headed
off to face Lord Hadlar.

00:07:51.175 --> 00:07:52.512
Bartos: And soon after...

00:07:52.545 --> 00:07:55.183
[defeated howl]

00:07:55.216 --> 00:07:58.557
Bartos: Hadlar's death cry
echoed through the palace!

00:08:00.594 --> 00:08:03.867
Bartos: Yet, somehow...
I continued to live.

00:08:12.384 --> 00:08:13.620
Bartos: Lord Hadlar!

00:08:13.653 --> 00:08:15.591
But how could
you have survived?

00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:17.460
In my final moments,

00:08:17.494 --> 00:08:21.570
I was saved by the dark powers
of the Underworld god, Vearn.

00:08:21.603 --> 00:08:23.874
He altered your fate... How?!

00:08:23.907 --> 00:08:28.316
I must now slumber for thirteen
years to build up my power,

00:08:28.349 --> 00:08:31.488
and then I will
create a new Dark Army.

00:08:31.523 --> 00:08:33.493
One even greater
and more terrifying

00:08:33.527 --> 00:08:35.330
than our current forces.

00:08:35.364 --> 00:08:36.934
But before I get to that,

00:08:36.967 --> 00:08:40.574
I need to deal with you,
loyal servant.

00:08:40.607 --> 00:08:41.943
Me? But, why?

00:08:41.977 --> 00:08:45.049
Because you've been an
absolute failure, Bartos...

00:08:45.083 --> 00:08:48.624
With your pathetic sense
of justice and chivalry.

00:08:48.657 --> 00:08:51.830
Your human-like
sentiment makes you weak.

00:08:51.863 --> 00:08:53.834
Hadlar: And on top of that,

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:57.441
you let Avan pass through
the Hell Gate, unchallenged.

00:08:57.474 --> 00:09:00.180
When I create my new Dark Army,

00:09:00.213 --> 00:09:05.824
there won't be any place
in it for a mistake like you!

00:09:08.396 --> 00:09:12.572
Well, Avan, I hope you enjoy
your brief moment of peace.

00:09:12.605 --> 00:09:15.177
When I awake and
assemble my new legions,

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.347
I'll come for you first.

00:09:21.021 --> 00:09:22.858
Hyunckel...

00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:27.735
Hyunckel: Dad?!

00:09:31.341 --> 00:09:32.310
Hyunckel: Dad!

00:09:34.849 --> 00:09:37.053
Bartos: H-Hyunckel...

00:09:37.087 --> 00:09:39.826
Bartos: By then, I no
longer had the strength

00:09:39.859 --> 00:09:41.897
to tell you the truth.

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:46.105
So I've hidden this message
within a Soul Shell in secret.

00:09:46.138 --> 00:09:50.146
I hope with all my heart
that one day you hear it.

00:09:53.119 --> 00:09:56.826
Hyunckel, I hope
you embrace humanity...

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.832
And that you do not
hate Master Avan.

00:09:59.866 --> 00:10:02.905
If anything, hate
this foolish monster

00:10:02.939 --> 00:10:06.178
for thinking he could
raise you like a man.

00:10:07.515 --> 00:10:09.753
But know that I was happy.

00:10:09.786 --> 00:10:11.422
Although it was brief,

00:10:11.456 --> 00:10:16.933
being your father made this cold
corpse of a body feel warmth.

00:10:16.967 --> 00:10:21.042
Now please, let me
say this one more time...

00:10:21.075 --> 00:10:26.252
Hyunckel... Thank you
for the memories.

00:10:26.285 --> 00:10:28.690
Hyunckel: Dad!

00:10:29.993 --> 00:10:31.797
Then that means
Lord Hadlar was

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:35.237
the one responsible for
his death all along?

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.472
And Avan...

00:10:36.506 --> 00:10:37.842
That means he must have known

00:10:37.876 --> 00:10:41.048
that I thought it was
his doing, and even still...

00:10:41.081 --> 00:10:44.354
He kept his promise
and took care of me?!

00:10:46.425 --> 00:10:48.095
Hyunckel: Lies...

00:10:48.129 --> 00:10:49.765
All lies!

00:10:53.439 --> 00:10:55.944
Sword and... magic...

00:10:57.748 --> 00:10:58.750
Popp: H-Hey, Dai?

00:10:58.783 --> 00:10:59.653
[worried chirps]

00:10:59.686 --> 00:11:02.457
Sword and... magic...

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.696
Wait a minute!

00:11:04.729 --> 00:11:06.065
Popp [thought]:
Something's wrong.

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:08.671
It's as if he doesn't
even recognize me.

00:11:08.704 --> 00:11:11.943
He almost looks
like he's unconscious...

00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:14.048
Uh, Dai?

00:11:14.081 --> 00:11:15.249
But how?

00:11:15.283 --> 00:11:18.723
A direct hit with Bloody Scryde
and the boy still lives?!

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.932
Popp [thought]: I remember.
Master Avan mentioned this.

00:11:39.966 --> 00:11:43.439
It's rare, but sometimes,
even after getting knocked out,

00:11:43.473 --> 00:11:47.013
certain martial artists will
just keep on fighting...

00:11:47.047 --> 00:11:50.053
Like their battle
instincts just keep going.

00:11:50.087 --> 00:11:53.594
That must be what's
happening to Dai!

00:11:53.627 --> 00:11:57.568
Don't do it! Please, Dai.
He'll kill you!

00:11:57.602 --> 00:11:58.903
Your friend's right.

00:11:58.937 --> 00:12:01.408
This time, I'll
finish you for sure.

00:12:01.442 --> 00:12:02.344
No, stop!

00:12:02.377 --> 00:12:05.016
Your father... You heard
what he told you.

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:07.454
Lord Hadlar's the one
you should really hate.

00:12:07.487 --> 00:12:08.691
We're not enemies.

00:12:08.724 --> 00:12:11.395
Just stop using your
sword for evil, Hyunckel!

00:12:11.428 --> 00:12:12.330
Enough!

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:16.707
There's no turning back for me.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.010
I'm the Commander
of the Undead Legion!

00:12:19.044 --> 00:12:22.618
And as long as I'm
still wearing this armor,

00:12:22.652 --> 00:12:26.458
I am the Dark Army's
vengeful warrior.

00:12:27.528 --> 00:12:29.164
But, Hyunckel...

00:12:37.815 --> 00:12:39.084
Here goes!

00:12:40.186 --> 00:12:41.990
[charging yell]

00:12:47.635 --> 00:12:49.271
Dai [thought]:
Magic... and sword...

00:12:49.305 --> 00:12:52.177
Oh, no... Dai doesn't
have his usual speed!

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.279
This is it!

00:12:53.312 --> 00:12:55.550
Dai: Magic... and sword!

00:12:57.254 --> 00:13:00.359
My supreme armor -
what did you do to it?

00:13:01.729 --> 00:13:04.569
Hyunckel: His sword...
it burns?

00:13:04.602 --> 00:13:06.540
That's the flame
of a Frizz spell!

00:13:06.573 --> 00:13:09.612
Hyunckel [thought]: No one can
encase a weapon in magic...

00:13:09.645 --> 00:13:11.048
And if they could,

00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:15.022
they would have to be something
far beyond a mere human!

00:13:26.278 --> 00:13:27.481
All right!

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:30.955
In the face of danger, Dai was
able to create a new attack.

00:13:30.988 --> 00:13:32.858
When neither magic or
sword worked alone,

00:13:32.891 --> 00:13:35.831
he found a way to use both...
in a Magic Sword!

00:13:35.865 --> 00:13:37.166
Curse you!

00:13:52.765 --> 00:13:54.502
Nice one! Do it!

00:14:02.618 --> 00:14:04.054
Oh, no!

00:14:05.289 --> 00:14:08.062
I promise I won't
miss this time!

00:14:08.095 --> 00:14:10.266
Popp [thought]:
I've gotta do something!

00:14:11.536 --> 00:14:13.841
The thunderclouds I summoned...

00:14:13.874 --> 00:14:18.449
Dai, the lighting!
Call down the lightning!

00:14:18.482 --> 00:14:21.288
Call the... Lightning...

00:14:21.321 --> 00:14:24.929
Give it up! I'll finish
you off once and for all.

00:14:24.962 --> 00:14:28.036
The lightning...
Call lightning...

00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:30.406
Call down the lightning!

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.609
Take this.

00:14:31.642 --> 00:14:34.347
Bloody Scryde!

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.988
[powerful yell]

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.394
Zap...

00:14:42.832 --> 00:14:46.438
Strash!

00:14:46.471 --> 00:14:48.242
[defeated roar]

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.797
He did it!

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.266
Popp [thought]:
Incomplete or not,

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:03.272
it's an Avan Strash
and Zapple double whammy!

00:15:03.305 --> 00:15:05.977
Not even Hyunckel
could withstand...

00:15:12.123 --> 00:15:14.194
Is he invincible?!

00:15:20.372 --> 00:15:22.343
[pained roar]

00:15:25.483 --> 00:15:27.888
We won! We beat him!

00:15:27.921 --> 00:15:30.392
[pained groan]

00:15:34.468 --> 00:15:36.873
Hyunckel [thought]:
It's no use. I'm finished!

00:15:36.907 --> 00:15:38.610
Dai, that's enough!

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.549
Maam...

00:15:41.582 --> 00:15:45.156
Dai, it's all over.
Look at him. You've won!

00:15:46.826 --> 00:15:48.129
Please, stop...

00:15:48.162 --> 00:15:52.103
I don't want to see the
Disciples of Avan fight anymore.

00:15:54.041 --> 00:15:56.344
She's... she's crying?

00:16:08.504 --> 00:16:11.174
Uh, Maam? Hyunckel?!

00:16:11.208 --> 00:16:13.346
Wh-What was I doing?

00:16:13.379 --> 00:16:14.849
You're back.

00:16:14.882 --> 00:16:16.620
Hyunckel: Why?

00:16:16.653 --> 00:16:18.624
I'm your enemy, Maam.

00:16:18.657 --> 00:16:20.492
No, you're one of us.

00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:26.004
That's my insignia...

00:16:31.382 --> 00:16:33.753
Hyunckel: You kept
it this whole time?

00:16:33.787 --> 00:16:36.993
Maam: I knew that the time would
come when you'd want it back,

00:16:37.026 --> 00:16:39.264
and I could return it to you.

00:16:41.503 --> 00:16:43.941
Hyunckel [thought]:
This kindness...

00:16:43.974 --> 00:16:47.047
This caring warmth...

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:51.154
She's like... an angel.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.068
Popp: Dai!

00:16:58.101 --> 00:16:59.438
Are you okay?

00:16:59.471 --> 00:17:00.239
[relieved chirps]

00:17:00.273 --> 00:17:01.977
Hey, Popp, Gomechan!

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:04.147
Did... Did I win?

00:17:04.181 --> 00:17:06.619
Hyunckel: You... You did.

00:17:06.652 --> 00:17:08.389
And... and I lost.

00:17:08.422 --> 00:17:09.758
No, you haven't.

00:17:15.738 --> 00:17:17.641
Whoa, what are you doing?

00:17:17.674 --> 00:17:20.380
He could come at us
again once he's healed.

00:17:20.413 --> 00:17:22.651
It's okay.
There's no need to worry.

00:17:22.685 --> 00:17:25.591
Well, come on - shouldn't
I get healed first, at least?

00:17:25.624 --> 00:17:26.592
[ominous laughing]

00:17:26.626 --> 00:17:27.661
[laughing]

00:17:27.694 --> 00:17:28.563
[alarmed grunts]

00:17:34.875 --> 00:17:36.713
Hey, I'm still
casting Midheal here.

00:17:36.746 --> 00:17:37.915
It's enough.

00:17:37.948 --> 00:17:40.153
Flazzard: Look
at you, Hyunckel!

00:17:40.186 --> 00:17:43.760
Laying right in the
enemy's lap after losing.

00:17:43.793 --> 00:17:46.064
It's hilarious!

00:17:46.098 --> 00:17:47.568
Stay back.

00:17:47.601 --> 00:17:48.803
Flazzard, was it?

00:17:48.837 --> 00:17:53.312
Yes, indeed. The mightiest of
the Six Legion Commanders.

00:17:53.345 --> 00:17:56.384
And it's Blizzblaze
General Flazzard to you.

00:17:56.418 --> 00:18:00.026
What is that guy? He's fire
and ice stuck together!

00:18:00.059 --> 00:18:02.097
So, what are you doing here?

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:03.666
Flazzard: Isn't it obvious?

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.369
I was just in the area...

00:18:05.403 --> 00:18:08.141
Thought I'd drop by
and kill you!

00:18:09.579 --> 00:18:13.319
You know, I have to say,
I've never really liked you.

00:18:13.352 --> 00:18:14.655
Flazzard: A human
thinking he could

00:18:14.688 --> 00:18:17.026
be worth something to
the Dark King?!

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.230
Never in a million years!

00:18:19.263 --> 00:18:20.265
If you'd won,

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:22.370
I figured I'd to
stab you in the back

00:18:22.404 --> 00:18:24.140
and take all the credit...

00:18:24.174 --> 00:18:26.913
But honestly, it's even
better that you lost.

00:18:26.946 --> 00:18:28.182
Now don't worry.

00:18:28.215 --> 00:18:30.588
I'll tell everyone that
you all killed each other

00:18:30.621 --> 00:18:32.891
and spare you the shame.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.899
Your cries will be
enough thanks for me!

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:39.972
What's this?!

00:18:40.005 --> 00:18:41.375
[evil chuckle]

00:18:41.408 --> 00:18:44.882
Just giving this dormant
volcano a little wake-up call.

00:18:44.915 --> 00:18:48.924
Soon enough, this place'll
be overflowing with lava!

00:18:48.957 --> 00:18:49.925
What?!

00:18:54.836 --> 00:18:57.339
Curse you, Flazzard!

00:18:57.373 --> 00:19:01.516
Whoops! Oh my, looks like
I'm not welcome in these parts!

00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:03.786
Guess I'll be bowing out then!

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:04.822
Everybody!

00:19:06.024 --> 00:19:09.765
That's it for me. I hope you
enjoy your swim in the lava.

00:19:09.799 --> 00:19:11.536
[cackling]

00:19:11.569 --> 00:19:13.506
Dai: It's no good!
We can't escape!

00:19:13.539 --> 00:19:15.610
If we could make it
up there, we could...

00:19:15.644 --> 00:19:18.315
But none of us have that
kind of strength left!

00:19:34.313 --> 00:19:35.617
No - Hyunckel!

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:40.560
I can't let any of you die here.
This is the only way.

00:19:40.594 --> 00:19:43.332
Hyunckel [thought]:
Crocodine, I finally understand

00:19:43.365 --> 00:19:45.402
what you were saying.

00:19:45.436 --> 00:19:48.810
I hope I can apologize
to you in the afterlife.

00:19:48.843 --> 00:19:54.021
But for now, just for an
instant... I need your help...

00:19:54.054 --> 00:19:56.592
Lend me your titan strength!

00:20:00.365 --> 00:20:02.938
Stop it. Don't do
this, Hyunckel!

00:20:02.971 --> 00:20:08.315
[powerful groan]

00:20:11.889 --> 00:20:12.858
Hyunckel...

00:20:12.891 --> 00:20:14.427
Maam: Hyunckel!

00:20:15.998 --> 00:20:17.534
Hyunckel [thought]:
Thank you all.

00:20:17.567 --> 00:20:20.540
At long last,
my eyes are open.

00:20:20.573 --> 00:20:24.515
I wish my fate were to carry
on helping the three of you...

00:20:24.548 --> 00:20:27.554
But it looks like
this is as far as I go.

00:20:29.792 --> 00:20:31.128
Maam: But, why...

00:20:31.161 --> 00:20:33.199
Popp: Watch out!
This place won't last!

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:34.267
Maam, c'mon!

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.071
Popp: It's coming down!
We've got to go!

00:20:36.104 --> 00:20:39.277
But Hyunckel! He's still...

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:41.281
Hyunckel [thought]:
Farewell, and keep fighting,

00:20:41.314 --> 00:20:43.820
Dai and Popp...

00:20:43.853 --> 00:20:46.759
Goodbye... Maam...

00:20:46.793 --> 00:20:49.965
Hyunckel!

00:20:57.614 --> 00:21:00.720
And so the Undead Legion ends.

00:21:00.753 --> 00:21:02.056
Master Hyunckel,

00:21:02.089 --> 00:21:04.194
I hope you'll
allow your humble Moruge

00:21:04.227 --> 00:21:06.732
to guide you
to the afterlife.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.980
Zaboera: I hear the Underground
Palace was destroyed.

00:21:14.013 --> 00:21:18.155
It seems that extinct
volcano suddenly erupted.

00:21:18.188 --> 00:21:20.594
Baran [thought]:
An extinct volcano erupting?

00:21:20.627 --> 00:21:21.596
[chuckling]

00:21:21.629 --> 00:21:25.269
Oh, my. Isn't that
a terrible shame.

00:21:25.303 --> 00:21:27.473
Flazzard: Long live
Hyunckel, right?

00:21:27.507 --> 00:21:30.747
And hey, he did take
the new Hero down with him,

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.385
so I'd say it
wasn't a bad job.

00:21:33.418 --> 00:21:35.690
Hadlar [thought]:
The audacity...

00:21:36.793 --> 00:21:39.096
[delighted chuckle]

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:40.432
Baran [thought]:
How terrifying it is

00:21:40.465 --> 00:21:43.874
to see a man so
starved for glory.

00:21:43.907 --> 00:21:46.779
Okay! Since we're
fresh out of Hyunckel,

00:21:46.812 --> 00:21:49.451
I guess that conquering
the Holkia continent

00:21:49.484 --> 00:21:52.590
can be my job now!

00:21:52.624 --> 00:21:56.533
Of course, all I gotta do
is find little Princess Leona

00:21:56.566 --> 00:21:58.769
and give her
the old dispatch!

00:22:00.907 --> 00:22:01.843
Easy!

00:22:01.876 --> 00:22:04.548
[delighted cackle]

00:23:37.801 --> 00:23:39.204
Narrator: With
Hyunckel defeated,

00:23:39.237 --> 00:23:41.709
Dai and his friends continue
their search for the Princess,

00:23:41.742 --> 00:23:44.848
and soon they meet Amy,
one of the Papnica Troika.

00:23:44.882 --> 00:23:48.756
Together, they travel to Valge
Island, where Leona awaits...

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:52.564
But the outpost is already under
siege by the Blizzblaze Legion,

00:23:52.598 --> 00:23:55.402
and Flazzard has a
trick up his sleeve.

00:23:55.435 --> 00:23:57.641
So make sure not to
miss the next episode of

00:23:57.674 --> 00:24:00.279
