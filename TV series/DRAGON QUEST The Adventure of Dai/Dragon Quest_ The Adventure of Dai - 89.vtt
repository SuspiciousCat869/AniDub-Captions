WEBVTT

00:01:53.861 --> 00:01:54.997
Mystvearn: You're
a peculiar one.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.233
You act like a clown,

00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:58.504
but no simple jester
could possibly know

00:01:58.537 --> 00:02:01.342
the name of the
Secret Spell of Frozen Time.

00:02:01.376 --> 00:02:03.246
Just who is this old guy?

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:04.717
Hym: Your guess is
as good as mine.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.920
I thought he only
came along to heal us.

00:02:06.954 --> 00:02:07.956
No, wait a minute...

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.693
Th-This is crazy...

00:02:09.726 --> 00:02:12.231
He's right.

00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:14.670
Mr. Beast:
No, it's necessary.

00:02:14.703 --> 00:02:17.274
Don't let me down, Popp.

00:02:39.318 --> 00:02:41.022
Mystvearn [thought]:
Such fluid movement...

00:02:41.056 --> 00:02:42.225
Wow. Look at him go!

00:02:42.258 --> 00:02:43.694
He's so nimble that...

00:02:43.728 --> 00:02:46.432
it's almost as if Mystvearn is
fighting a feather in the wind!

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:48.470
Larhart [thought]: For anyone
able to move around like that,

00:02:48.504 --> 00:02:51.042
sticking close to their
opponent is actually safer

00:02:51.075 --> 00:02:52.311
than a ranged assault.

00:02:52.344 --> 00:02:53.881
Hym [thought]:
And he fights like he's

00:02:53.914 --> 00:02:56.586
a walking martial
arts textbook.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.660
Enough games. Stop
clinging to me, you pest.

00:02:59.693 --> 00:03:01.062
Hyunckel: Popp, do it.

00:03:01.095 --> 00:03:02.231
Now's your chance!

00:03:02.264 --> 00:03:03.734
Y-Yeah, I know...

00:03:03.768 --> 00:03:05.470
Let me concentrate.

00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:08.678
Popp [thought]: Medroa...

00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:10.013
C'mon...

00:03:10.046 --> 00:03:13.319
Don't let me mess
this up, Medroa...

00:03:13.352 --> 00:03:17.227
Maam: Uh, Popp? Why are you
casting two Crack spells?

00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:18.531
Is something wrong?

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:19.532
Huh?!

00:03:22.706 --> 00:03:24.643
W-Well... I guess...

00:03:24.676 --> 00:03:27.915
Maybe I... just can't
handle the pressure.

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.161
Popp: I mean, I've
never had to before...

00:03:34.195 --> 00:03:38.035
You know how everything always
comes down to Dai or Hyunckel.

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.077
But now, everybody's counting
on me as their last hope.

00:03:42.111 --> 00:03:45.885
Honestly, I'm not sure if
I can even carry that weight.

00:03:45.918 --> 00:03:48.156
I know it's pathetic...

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:50.194
but I just can't get...

00:03:50.227 --> 00:03:52.497
my hands to stop shaking...

00:03:55.103 --> 00:03:56.406
Come on, don't be an idiot.

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:58.276
We've all seen how
strong you've become...

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.582
Of course you're nervous.
Anybody would be.

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:03.052
But use that power
you've worked for!

00:04:03.086 --> 00:04:05.256
Even Grand Master is
giving his best!

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.260
Whoa-aah!

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:11.703
A direct hit?!

00:04:15.745 --> 00:04:17.280
Mr. Beast: Whoopsie.

00:04:17.314 --> 00:04:19.786
You've gotta be kidding...

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.523
Mr. Beast: Some may
call me withered,

00:04:21.556 --> 00:04:24.896
however, I think
of myself as "cured."

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:25.898
With my years of training,

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:28.169
I'm able to float like
a leaf on the wind...

00:04:28.203 --> 00:04:30.841
absorbing the
force of any attack.

00:04:30.875 --> 00:04:34.616
It's one of the ultimate
skills of my fighting style.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.287
And that single hit has
confirmed my suspicions

00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:40.460
about your true
nature, Mystvearn...

00:04:40.494 --> 00:04:44.703
Because your body
is abnormally cold.

00:04:44.736 --> 00:04:47.207
Mr. Beast: I've encountered
such an enchantment before...

00:04:47.241 --> 00:04:48.710
It was over a decade ago,

00:04:48.744 --> 00:04:52.017
when we did battle with
the Dark Lord Hadlar.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.386
All: What?!

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:54.556
Popp: Hadlar...

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:57.394
Seriously? You fought Hadlar?

00:04:57.427 --> 00:05:00.501
Mr. Beast: Indeed. Remember
it like it was yesterday.

00:05:00.534 --> 00:05:02.906
After all, who could
ever forget fighting...

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:05.612
alongside Avan himself.

00:05:05.645 --> 00:05:06.713
All: What?!

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.621
Mr. Beast: Yes.
Now, on this occasion,

00:05:10.655 --> 00:05:15.230
Avan conjured a legendary spell
for the first and last time...

00:05:15.263 --> 00:05:17.301
And that spell
was none other...

00:05:17.334 --> 00:05:20.508
than the Secret
Spell of Frozen Time!

00:05:20.541 --> 00:05:22.478
It was seventeen years ago,

00:05:22.512 --> 00:05:24.983
at the peak of the
Dark Lord's reign.

00:05:25.017 --> 00:05:25.919
Mr. Beast: In those days,

00:05:25.952 --> 00:05:27.855
the Hero traveled
with his companions -

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.393
Roka the Warrior and
Leira the Priest -

00:05:30.426 --> 00:05:32.965
on a quest to rid the
world of Hadlar's blight.

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:36.874
You want to cast the
Secret Spell of Frozen Time?!

00:05:36.907 --> 00:05:39.746
Roka: Well... Fine.
What does it do, anyway?

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:41.415
Avan: Exactly what
it sounds like.

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:42.718
I've read the books.

00:05:42.752 --> 00:05:45.123
It's able to freeze someone
at a moment in time...

00:05:45.157 --> 00:05:48.730
Which means it can hold
them in place indefinitely.

00:05:48.764 --> 00:05:51.335
Whomever it's cast upon
is rendered immobile -

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:53.841
almost if they've been
struck by a Kaclang...

00:05:53.874 --> 00:05:57.014
and they also become
impervious to any force.

00:05:57.047 --> 00:05:59.451
But unlike the effects
of a Kaclang spell,

00:05:59.485 --> 00:06:00.921
this incantation
will even stop

00:06:00.955 --> 00:06:04.261
the biological functions of
whoever it's conjured upon.

00:06:04.295 --> 00:06:06.600
After all, from
their point of view,

00:06:06.633 --> 00:06:09.372
you have effectively
halted time itself.

00:06:09.405 --> 00:06:10.708
And as it happens,

00:06:10.741 --> 00:06:12.912
it's useful for more than
just protecting oneself...

00:06:12.945 --> 00:06:16.051
Because it stops the enemy
in their tracks, too.

00:06:16.887 --> 00:06:17.855
Sir Avan...

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:20.193
Do you mean you intend
to defeat Lord Hadlar...

00:06:20.226 --> 00:06:21.663
using that?

00:06:21.697 --> 00:06:24.168
Defeat him, yes. But it won't
be enough to finish him off...

00:06:24.202 --> 00:06:28.644
Nevertheless, it does give us a
chance to seal him away forever.

00:06:28.677 --> 00:06:31.048
We could secure the
world an era of peace.

00:06:31.081 --> 00:06:33.319
"An era of peace," huh? Sure.

00:06:33.352 --> 00:06:34.623
I've done the research, Roka.

00:06:34.656 --> 00:06:36.727
All the ancient tomes
agree it's possible.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.697
But there is a bit of a catch.

00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:41.537
Today... is our only
chance to cast it.

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.373
Avan: During that
once-in-centuries

00:06:43.407 --> 00:06:46.112
total solar eclipse.

00:06:46.145 --> 00:06:48.884
Lucky you're a fast reader.

00:06:48.917 --> 00:06:52.057
[hearty laugh]

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.993
Well!

00:06:53.026 --> 00:06:55.665
I stand corrected,
books really are useful.

00:06:55.698 --> 00:06:57.836
Sounds like a good find.

00:06:57.869 --> 00:06:59.004
I've always said,

00:06:59.037 --> 00:07:01.510
"the strongest thing about
that Avan is his intellect."

00:07:01.543 --> 00:07:03.046
Right, old pal?

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:04.315
[chuckling]

00:07:04.348 --> 00:07:05.483
C'mon!

00:07:05.517 --> 00:07:07.287
On your feet. Let's
get this thing going.

00:07:07.321 --> 00:07:09.960
We don't want to miss our
once-in-a-century chance, do we?

00:07:09.993 --> 00:07:12.297
Hadlar's about to
regret messing with us!

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.701
Well, there's
one more catch...

00:07:13.734 --> 00:07:16.506
I'm afraid you both
won't be joining me.

00:07:17.975 --> 00:07:19.913
Roka... Leira...

00:07:19.947 --> 00:07:22.652
You'll both disagree, but this
fight will be far too dangerous.

00:07:22.685 --> 00:07:24.756
I won't ask you to come along.

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:25.658
Wh...

00:07:26.458 --> 00:07:27.596
Are you nuts?

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:29.799
Can you even hear
how stupid you sound?!

00:07:29.832 --> 00:07:32.638
I meant exactly what
I just said, my friend.

00:07:32.672 --> 00:07:34.610
There's no way around it.

00:07:34.643 --> 00:07:37.715
This party must be
temporarily disbanded.

00:07:39.051 --> 00:07:39.886
But, Sir Avan...

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:41.824
What... What makes
you think that?

00:07:41.857 --> 00:07:43.561
Avan: The full scope
of this enchantment

00:07:43.594 --> 00:07:45.330
still isn't
fully understood.

00:07:45.363 --> 00:07:48.369
All that's certain is, it
uses the power of nature...

00:07:48.403 --> 00:07:51.843
So it stands to reason that it
will work on the Dark Lord...

00:07:51.876 --> 00:07:53.112
All the same,

00:07:53.146 --> 00:07:55.518
I don't know if I'll be able to
control the spell's aftershock.

00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:57.789
If it's too strong,
and I can't hold it off...

00:07:57.822 --> 00:07:59.892
Well, then in
the worst case...

00:07:59.926 --> 00:08:03.701
You'll wind up frozen in
time along with Lord Hadlar.

00:08:03.734 --> 00:08:06.540
Avan: Even if we do win
the world its era of peace...

00:08:06.574 --> 00:08:08.442
If there's no one
around to enjoy it,

00:08:08.476 --> 00:08:10.213
then we've won
it for nothing.

00:08:10.246 --> 00:08:13.987
That's why I need you to leave
this one to me - understand?

00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:16.292
"Understand"?!

00:08:16.326 --> 00:08:17.428
Yeah, I understand.

00:08:17.461 --> 00:08:19.464
Brokeena: Are they
really fighting again?

00:08:19.498 --> 00:08:21.168
Matoriv: They're
always fighting.

00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:22.671
But something about this time

00:08:22.705 --> 00:08:25.177
seems a little more serious
than the usual antics.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.049
Roka: Let's work together and
fight this creep as a team -

00:08:28.082 --> 00:08:31.222
the same way we've always
done it? Huh, tough guy?

00:08:31.255 --> 00:08:32.659
Isn't that the point?

00:08:32.692 --> 00:08:35.363
Huh? I'm not sitting
this one out, Avan.

00:08:35.397 --> 00:08:37.668
I'm not afraid of danger.

00:08:37.701 --> 00:08:40.407
I can't allow you to take
that kind of risk, Roka.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.776
Why?!

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:44.014
It's got nothing to do with
glory. Don't be so thick.

00:08:44.048 --> 00:08:46.185
I want you to survive
so you can look after

00:08:46.219 --> 00:08:49.057
the woman you love and
build a life together.

00:08:51.797 --> 00:08:52.965
You... You knew about us?

00:08:52.999 --> 00:08:55.137
I mean, we were
going to tell you...

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.307
Besides. It changes nothing!

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.480
It's not like I'm serious
about this girl or anything!

00:09:00.514 --> 00:09:01.750
Not serious?

00:09:01.783 --> 00:09:02.651
Yeah!

00:09:03.452 --> 00:09:06.793
Wait! I didn't
mean it like that!

00:09:06.827 --> 00:09:09.465
My mistake. It seemed
serious enough to me.

00:09:09.498 --> 00:09:11.503
Wh-? I - now let me explain!

00:09:11.536 --> 00:09:12.705
No excuses!

00:09:12.738 --> 00:09:14.876
You need to take
responsibility...

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:17.113
You're about to
become a father.

00:09:23.159 --> 00:09:25.163
Y-You... What did you...

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.869
Leira: Sir Avan...

00:09:27.902 --> 00:09:30.407
You already knew that
I was with child?

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.879
But I'd only just
found out myself.

00:09:32.912 --> 00:09:35.350
I hadn't even told Roka yet.

00:09:35.383 --> 00:09:36.687
Avan: Roka can
get quite awkward

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.557
about anything that makes
him feel vulnerable.

00:09:38.591 --> 00:09:40.762
Even if he knew, he'd
still try to hide it.

00:09:40.795 --> 00:09:42.163
When we were younger,

00:09:42.197 --> 00:09:44.902
he'd always saying things
like "I live by the sword" or

00:09:44.936 --> 00:09:46.807
"I'll never fall
in love with a girl

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.677
and let myself go all soft."

00:09:48.711 --> 00:09:50.682
I know he can
be a handful, but...

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:53.219
his heart belongs
to you. Look after him.

00:09:53.252 --> 00:09:56.392
Any child born in a
time of war deserves this.

00:09:56.425 --> 00:10:00.132
A chance at a life of peace.

00:10:01.636 --> 00:10:03.574
When you do bring this
life into the world,

00:10:03.607 --> 00:10:05.812
give it a good,
kind name, Leira.

00:10:05.845 --> 00:10:08.282
Yes. Of course, I will.

00:10:13.159 --> 00:10:15.731
Matoriv: That's
just the way he is.

00:10:17.067 --> 00:10:17.902
M-Matoriv.

00:10:17.935 --> 00:10:20.107
He really can't
help himself, huh?

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.010
Only Avan would put
himself on the line

00:10:22.043 --> 00:10:24.115
for somebody who
hasn't been born.

00:10:24.148 --> 00:10:27.621
Funny to hear him
talk about "awkward".

00:10:27.655 --> 00:10:30.761
His heart belongs
to somebody as well.

00:10:32.397 --> 00:10:34.067
I'll keep him out of trouble.

00:10:34.101 --> 00:10:36.873
There's no girlfriend to
mourn me if I bite it.

00:10:36.907 --> 00:10:40.313
No promises, but I'll do my best
to get him back in one piece.

00:10:40.346 --> 00:10:44.321
I make it a point to never let
a lady cry if I can help it.

00:10:44.355 --> 00:10:46.392
[laughing]

00:10:46.425 --> 00:10:49.097
Matoriv: Come along,
Brokeena. Let's get moving.

00:11:14.047 --> 00:11:15.951
I owe you an apology,
Grand Master.

00:11:15.984 --> 00:11:17.955
I wish I didn't
have to drag you into

00:11:17.988 --> 00:11:19.925
such a perilous
battle in your state.

00:11:19.959 --> 00:11:23.098
Nothing to worry
about, my dear boy.

00:11:23.132 --> 00:11:24.368
[wheezing]

00:11:24.401 --> 00:11:25.369
With my illness,

00:11:25.403 --> 00:11:28.276
there aren't many more
battles ahead, anyways.

00:11:28.309 --> 00:11:29.713
Not this again...

00:11:29.746 --> 00:11:31.649
I'm counting on you, though.

00:11:31.683 --> 00:11:33.687
I need the Dark
Lord distracted.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.256
Even just for a moment.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.795
A feat which only the
greatest martial artist

00:11:37.828 --> 00:11:40.032
in the realm can accomplish.

00:11:42.003 --> 00:11:45.177
"Greatest in the realm" huh?
Am I famous or something?

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:46.212
Yeah.

00:11:46.245 --> 00:11:48.082
Like myself, you're
one of the few old geezers

00:11:48.115 --> 00:11:51.321
still kicking around that
the world hasn't forgotten.

00:11:51.355 --> 00:11:53.025
[laughing]

00:11:56.967 --> 00:12:00.106
I'll take care
of the riffraff.

00:12:00.139 --> 00:12:02.110
Matoriv: Good luck
to you, Avan.

00:12:15.671 --> 00:12:17.440
Avan [thought]: Until
I've completed my Strash

00:12:17.474 --> 00:12:19.078
and perfected my
Sword Technique,

00:12:19.111 --> 00:12:21.315
I won't be a
match for Hadlar.

00:12:21.349 --> 00:12:22.284
From where we stand,

00:12:22.317 --> 00:12:25.323
there's only one
certain road to peace...

00:12:25.356 --> 00:12:26.926
And this is it.

00:12:39.017 --> 00:12:40.119
Sizzle!

00:12:41.222 --> 00:12:42.858
Kaswoosh!

00:12:45.463 --> 00:12:47.100
Boom!

00:13:13.052 --> 00:13:15.957
Secret Spell of Frozen Time!

00:13:22.805 --> 00:13:23.674
Avan [thought]: N-No...

00:13:23.707 --> 00:13:25.644
It's just as I feared...

00:13:25.678 --> 00:13:28.883
I'm not... I'm not
strong enough to...

00:13:57.675 --> 00:13:59.010
Mr. Beast: It came at a price,

00:13:59.044 --> 00:14:01.048
but the spell
worked as expected.

00:14:01.081 --> 00:14:03.219
Hadlar and Avan
both stood frozen

00:14:03.252 --> 00:14:04.756
in the middle
of their struggle.

00:14:04.789 --> 00:14:06.492
Neither even blinked an eye.

00:14:06.526 --> 00:14:09.866
For a period of over a year,
their time remained stopped...

00:14:09.899 --> 00:14:11.302
With their leader indisposed,

00:14:11.335 --> 00:14:13.974
soon the Dark Army
headed for the hills.

00:14:14.007 --> 00:14:15.443
And so, brief though it was,

00:14:15.477 --> 00:14:18.282
the Hero succeeded in bringing a
season of peace upon the world.

00:14:22.357 --> 00:14:23.526
When you came to me,

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.232
seeking training in the ways
of the Warrior-Master Style,

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:30.006
I truly felt the
hand of fate at work.

00:14:30.039 --> 00:14:31.475
Mr. Beast: When their
daughter was born,

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.715
the name Roka and Leira
decided to give her...

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:36.218
was Maam.

00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:40.126
I fought by your parents'
side for many years.

00:14:41.361 --> 00:14:43.733
Grand master.

00:14:43.767 --> 00:14:45.002
Popp [thought]:
What are the odds...

00:14:45.036 --> 00:14:46.773
So Grand Master
Brokeena was a

00:14:46.806 --> 00:14:49.512
member of Master
Avan's party, too?

00:14:49.545 --> 00:14:51.650
Hyunckel [thought]: I knew
there was more to him

00:14:51.683 --> 00:14:53.119
than he was letting on.

00:14:53.152 --> 00:14:55.056
I suppose that explains it.

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:57.460
If you were one of
Avan's meddlesome allies,

00:14:57.494 --> 00:15:01.134
then there's no mystery to how
you know of the secret spell.

00:15:01.168 --> 00:15:02.705
Mr. Beast: [chuckle]

00:15:02.738 --> 00:15:04.007
Hang on. Grand Master,

00:15:04.041 --> 00:15:06.278
didn't you say that this
Secret Spell of Frozen time

00:15:06.312 --> 00:15:09.418
is supposed to paralyze its
target like a Kaclang does?

00:15:09.451 --> 00:15:11.989
Wouldn't that mean if
it's cast on Mystvearn...

00:15:12.023 --> 00:15:13.994
Shouldn't he be
stuck in place?

00:15:14.027 --> 00:15:15.363
Mr. Beast: Not necessarily.

00:15:15.396 --> 00:15:17.333
Avan said the
incantation was useful

00:15:17.366 --> 00:15:19.137
for more than
just protection...

00:15:19.171 --> 00:15:22.545
Our foe must have a way to
wield its power like a shield.

00:15:22.578 --> 00:15:24.014
That's what I suspect.

00:15:24.048 --> 00:15:25.917
I haven't worked out
how he's doing it,

00:15:25.951 --> 00:15:27.922
but this keeps him
able to move around

00:15:27.955 --> 00:15:29.792
while the spell still
somehow prevents him

00:15:29.826 --> 00:15:31.194
from taking any damage...

00:15:31.228 --> 00:15:34.200
Which is why all of our
attacks have had no effect.

00:15:34.234 --> 00:15:36.572
Because time itself
is frozen for him,

00:15:36.606 --> 00:15:39.612
his body has been locked in
an indestructible state.

00:15:39.645 --> 00:15:42.885
Therefore, as long as
the enchantment is active,

00:15:42.918 --> 00:15:45.758
he remains impervious
to physical strikes.

00:15:45.791 --> 00:15:47.026
It's like fighting an opponent

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.431
who's shielded
by a Kaclang spell,

00:15:49.464 --> 00:15:52.336
but is still able
to throw a punch.

00:15:54.642 --> 00:15:57.246
Well observed.
You're correct.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.719
But you still don't
you see, do you?

00:15:59.752 --> 00:16:01.354
Knowing that changes nothing.

00:16:01.388 --> 00:16:04.394
You've already declared
your own death sentence.

00:16:04.427 --> 00:16:09.004
I can fight while my form
remains frozen in time...

00:16:09.037 --> 00:16:11.174
That means, no
matter what you do...

00:16:11.207 --> 00:16:13.613
It won't harm me.
I am invincible.

00:16:14.982 --> 00:16:17.120
Popp [thought]: He's right.
There goes our plan.

00:16:17.153 --> 00:16:18.456
An enemy who can still attack

00:16:18.489 --> 00:16:20.928
while they're under the
effects of a Kaclang spell...

00:16:20.961 --> 00:16:22.397
They'd be unbeatable.

00:16:22.431 --> 00:16:25.403
Mr. Beast: Now, now.
Not to fear, Popp.

00:16:25.437 --> 00:16:27.842
You see, there is
still one exception

00:16:27.875 --> 00:16:29.177
to his indomitable state...

00:16:29.211 --> 00:16:32.384
and that's the spell Matoriv
has handed down to you.

00:16:32.417 --> 00:16:34.487
On the day we used
the Secret Spell,

00:16:34.521 --> 00:16:36.292
Matoriv could do
nothing but watch

00:16:36.325 --> 00:16:38.563
as Avan was forced
to sacrifice himself.

00:16:38.597 --> 00:16:41.201
Wracked with guilt, he
decided to keep such a fate

00:16:41.234 --> 00:16:43.205
from befalling
his allies again.

00:16:43.238 --> 00:16:45.209
He created a spell
to rival it...

00:16:45.242 --> 00:16:47.882
An Extreme
Annihilation Spell...

00:16:47.915 --> 00:16:49.719
That he called Medroa!

00:16:49.752 --> 00:16:51.255
Mr. Beast: Yes.

00:16:51.288 --> 00:16:54.194
Mystvearn: You're just
a withered little leaf...

00:16:54.227 --> 00:16:56.867
Mystvearn: Once I catch you,
you'll crumble in my hand.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.137
If all you do is
flutter around like this,

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:02.343
then Larhart would've made
a more worthy adversary.

00:17:04.147 --> 00:17:06.753
This is the end - you clown!

00:17:06.786 --> 00:17:08.488
Grand Master!

00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:14.500
Mr. Beast: [roaring]

00:17:16.271 --> 00:17:18.510
Mr. Beast [thought]: Now
all I need is an instant.

00:17:18.544 --> 00:17:20.848
So hear me, mighty
gods of the fist...

00:17:20.881 --> 00:17:24.220
And grant me the strength
of my youth one last time!

00:17:24.254 --> 00:17:26.125
Once more into the breach!

00:17:26.158 --> 00:17:30.266
To ensure this next generation
sees a peaceful future!

00:17:35.744 --> 00:17:37.214
Maam [thought]: Oh, wow...

00:17:37.247 --> 00:17:38.616
If it wasn't Mystvearn,

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:41.254
Grand Master's first strike
alone would have ended this.

00:17:41.288 --> 00:17:43.960
I had no idea that
he was this powerful

00:17:43.993 --> 00:17:45.630
when he fights
at full strength!

00:17:48.002 --> 00:17:49.337
Popp, are... Are you...

00:17:49.371 --> 00:17:51.709
You bet I am.
It's now or never...

00:17:51.742 --> 00:17:55.215
This is our only shot -
and I'm not gonna miss it.

00:17:57.053 --> 00:17:59.090
I know you won't.

00:17:59.123 --> 00:18:00.259
Popp: They really
were amazing.

00:18:00.292 --> 00:18:02.130
Weren't they, Maam?
All of them.

00:18:02.163 --> 00:18:05.436
Avan, your parents,
Matoriv, and Grand Master...

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:07.173
The only reason
we're here right now

00:18:07.207 --> 00:18:09.845
is thanks to these great
people who came before us...

00:18:09.878 --> 00:18:11.816
Who blazed the
trail to victory.

00:18:11.849 --> 00:18:13.285
If I can't pull this off...

00:18:13.318 --> 00:18:15.724
then I ain't no
Disciple of Avan!

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.763
Here goes everything.

00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:22.470
I'll make sure that
this Medroa hits the mark...

00:18:22.505 --> 00:18:26.512
even if it's the last
thing that I ever do!

00:18:26.545 --> 00:18:27.648
Hym [thought]:
That's the spirit.

00:18:27.681 --> 00:18:29.752
Get back on your feet
and don't let up.

00:18:29.785 --> 00:18:33.726
It's tenacity like this that
makes a real Disciple of Avan.

00:18:38.335 --> 00:18:41.776
I've had my fill of
your futile resistance!

00:18:44.247 --> 00:18:45.884
I grow bored.

00:18:51.963 --> 00:18:53.465
Popp [thought]: Focus...

00:18:59.211 --> 00:19:01.314
Maam [thought]: Get out
of there, Grand Master!

00:19:03.218 --> 00:19:04.756
Mr. Beast: Warrior
Master Style...

00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:07.226
Earth Wyrm Eruption Strike!

00:19:09.164 --> 00:19:11.235
Now, Popp! This is it!

00:19:11.268 --> 00:19:13.506
Maam: That attack is about
to make the floor explode.

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.042
When Mystvearn's
knocked over,

00:19:15.075 --> 00:19:17.581
you'll have a moment
to take him off-guard.

00:19:19.084 --> 00:19:20.452
I've got it!

00:19:28.904 --> 00:19:30.439
Mr. Beast: It was a dud?

00:19:32.712 --> 00:19:33.880
No, don't!

00:19:34.247 --> 00:19:35.717
Very clever.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:37.655
I suppose it's
possible that Matoriv

00:19:37.688 --> 00:19:41.395
could have devised a
spell able to defeat me.

00:19:41.428 --> 00:19:42.597
Mr. Beast: But nowadays,

00:19:42.631 --> 00:19:45.336
I can only last about
a minute at full power.

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:49.377
The ravages of age
certainly take their toll.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.984
I didn't think I'd
lost that much stamina

00:19:53.018 --> 00:19:55.355
since our fight
against Hadlar.

00:19:57.561 --> 00:20:01.000
Your miraculous plan to turn
the tide of this battle...

00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:03.873
appears to be foiled,
little Mage.

00:20:03.906 --> 00:20:05.578
Or are you willing to sacrifice

00:20:05.611 --> 00:20:08.550
the Grand Master to
bring me to an end?

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:09.518
Maam: Master!

00:20:10.721 --> 00:20:13.560
Mr. Beast: Forget about me,
Popp. Do it! Cast the spell.

00:20:13.593 --> 00:20:16.666
My days have been numbered
for far too long as it is.

00:20:16.699 --> 00:20:19.905
It's better that I
perish than all of you.

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:25.950
I know what I have
to do... Grand Master.

00:20:28.422 --> 00:20:30.325
Popp, you can't...

00:20:30.359 --> 00:20:33.065
Mystvearn: He won't.
He's bluffing.

00:20:33.098 --> 00:20:35.436
You so-called
disciples of justice...

00:20:35.469 --> 00:20:37.340
are never willing
to pay the hard price.

00:20:37.373 --> 00:20:38.843
Don't be so sure.

00:20:38.877 --> 00:20:41.247
I'll do what I have to do.

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:44.555
And when this is all over...

00:20:44.588 --> 00:20:47.795
Master Avan and Grand
Master Brokeena...

00:20:47.828 --> 00:20:51.603
are going to enjoy the
peace we've won for them!

00:20:51.636 --> 00:20:52.838
What?

00:20:53.639 --> 00:20:55.409
Watch and see.

00:20:55.744 --> 00:20:58.315
Medroa!

00:21:01.723 --> 00:21:02.757
Zoom!

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.644
Hyunckel [thought]:
He'll never dodge that!

00:21:12.677 --> 00:21:15.650
Hym [thought]: Get him!
Erase his existence!

00:21:18.189 --> 00:21:20.325
Crocodine [thought]:
There's no escape!

00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:43.706
[horrified gasp]

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:52.724
G-Grand Master...
Po... Popp!

00:21:52.758 --> 00:21:55.429
What just happened?
Where did they go?

00:23:37.333 --> 00:23:39.404
Avan: Caught in the
path of the Medroa spell

00:23:39.438 --> 00:23:40.741
meant for Mystvearn,

00:23:40.774 --> 00:23:43.479
Popp and Brokeena have
vanished in a dreadful flash.

00:23:43.513 --> 00:23:45.282
As the party scrambles
over their loss,

00:23:45.315 --> 00:23:48.656
Hyunckel realizes his old
mentor's greatest secret...

00:23:48.689 --> 00:23:51.161
But before he can act,
the Reaper appears -

00:23:51.194 --> 00:23:52.964
signaling Avan's defeat.

00:23:52.998 --> 00:23:54.000
And soon,

00:23:54.033 --> 00:23:55.770
the century-spanning
relationship of the beings

00:23:55.804 --> 00:23:58.341
who bear the Dark King's
name will be revealed...

00:23:58.375 --> 00:23:59.845
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:59.878 --> 00:24:02.149
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:02.182 --> 00:24:04.053
"Myst and Kill".
