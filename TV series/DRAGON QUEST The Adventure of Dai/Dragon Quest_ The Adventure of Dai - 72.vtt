WEBVTT

00:01:50.588 --> 00:01:51.590
Zapple!

00:02:00.207 --> 00:02:02.310
Killvearn: Seems
pointless to me.

00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:07.054
Hadlar: Making up for lost
Aura with magic won't help you.

00:02:07.088 --> 00:02:08.456
Go ahead and try it.

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.229
You and I are
both well aware...

00:02:11.262 --> 00:02:13.000
a Zap Strash will
pale in comparison

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:15.604
to that new attack
you already unleashed.

00:02:26.192 --> 00:02:28.263
What are you doing?
Why sheathe your blade?

00:02:28.296 --> 00:02:29.566
Wait, that's it.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.237
I think Dai must be planning
to use his new scabbard!

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.010
Dai: Because this
is a new weapon

00:02:35.043 --> 00:02:37.782
Lon Beruk made to
fight Vearn.

00:02:37.816 --> 00:02:39.520
My Magic Sword is already

00:02:39.553 --> 00:02:41.991
as strong as it
could get on its own.

00:02:42.024 --> 00:02:43.393
But with this scabbard,

00:02:43.426 --> 00:02:44.630
I can increase its power

00:02:44.663 --> 00:02:47.869
in ways that nobody's
ever seen before.

00:02:47.902 --> 00:02:49.338
Really?

00:02:49.372 --> 00:02:52.912
His instructions said that If I
cast a spell and sheathe it...

00:02:52.946 --> 00:02:56.553
the Magic's Power is supposed
to be amplified inside...

00:02:56.586 --> 00:02:59.224
And when I draw
this blade again,

00:02:59.258 --> 00:03:01.029
then that spell will
have transformed

00:03:01.062 --> 00:03:03.133
into its ultimate variation.

00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:05.037
Hadlar [thought]: If
that's the case, then...

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.975
Is his Zapple going to
become a Kazap?

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.360
Hadlar [thought]:
A Zoom spell?

00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:26.479
I don't get it.
Why'd he move over there?

00:03:26.513 --> 00:03:29.085
Amplifying the Magic Power
won't happen instantly...

00:03:29.118 --> 00:03:30.655
It's a delicate process.

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:33.327
He needs to buy time -
that's what he's doing.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.532
That's not the only reason.

00:03:35.565 --> 00:03:38.671
Think about it.
If this actually works...

00:03:38.704 --> 00:03:41.543
his next attack
will be insanely strong.

00:03:41.577 --> 00:03:44.348
So he distanced
himself to make sure

00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:46.485
we don't get hurt
by the fallout.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.661
Brace yourselves. This
is gonna be something else.

00:03:50.694 --> 00:03:53.132
Popp [thought]: I won't try
to stop you anymore, Dai.

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:54.903
I have faith in that
power of yours...

00:03:54.936 --> 00:03:58.243
the power that's given us
miracle after miracle.

00:03:58.276 --> 00:04:01.583
Give him everything
you've got. You can do this.

00:04:19.252 --> 00:04:22.692
Dai: Ten... nine...

00:04:22.725 --> 00:04:25.463
Hadlar [thought]: If he's
able to conjure a Kazap,

00:04:25.497 --> 00:04:28.804
then I know exactly what
attack he's planning to use:

00:04:28.838 --> 00:04:33.581
the last gift from his
fallen father... Gigabreak.

00:04:33.614 --> 00:04:35.618
I could stop him right now.

00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:39.291
It would be so easy, but...

00:04:42.666 --> 00:04:44.235
[cackling]

00:04:44.268 --> 00:04:45.571
Why bother?

00:04:46.706 --> 00:04:50.581
Using my last attack
will destroy me, anyway.

00:04:53.587 --> 00:04:55.658
I shall use my last
few moments...

00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:57.461
to summon the rest
of my strength

00:04:57.495 --> 00:04:59.431
and take you down with me!

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.814
Five...

00:05:06.847 --> 00:05:08.785
Four...

00:05:08.818 --> 00:05:10.522
Three...

00:05:10.555 --> 00:05:12.024
Two...

00:05:12.057 --> 00:05:13.326
One...

00:05:22.011 --> 00:05:23.547
And zero!

00:05:42.418 --> 00:05:43.587
I knew it.

00:05:43.621 --> 00:05:45.992
Now, I'll show you how
Baran's greatest attack

00:05:46.025 --> 00:05:48.163
is still no match for mine.

00:05:48.196 --> 00:05:51.503
I'll give this every ounce
of life force I have left.

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:55.878
Ultra Combustion Slash!

00:06:06.767 --> 00:06:10.107
[snarling]

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.778
This is it!

00:06:12.812 --> 00:06:13.647
[roaring]

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:17.788
I couldn't agree more.

00:06:21.697 --> 00:06:27.675
[roaring]

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:29.613
Say your farewells, Hero.

00:06:29.646 --> 00:06:32.017
I'm going to shatter
you in a single blow!

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.988
No, you won't shatter this!

00:06:34.021 --> 00:06:34.956
Every fight...

00:06:34.989 --> 00:06:37.260
Every single battle has
been leading us here

00:06:37.293 --> 00:06:38.730
to this moment!

00:06:40.934 --> 00:06:42.203
I won't fail.

00:06:42.237 --> 00:06:44.375
There's way too
much riding on this.

00:06:44.408 --> 00:06:47.147
So here's the best
attack I can do!

00:06:51.121 --> 00:06:52.591
How could he...

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.089
Giga... Strash!

00:07:33.774 --> 00:07:36.112
Hadlar [thought]:
Giga Strash...

00:07:36.145 --> 00:07:38.149
Well done, Dai.

00:07:45.197 --> 00:07:48.537
It seems everything I
had still wasn't enough

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.841
and this is how it all ends.

00:07:54.348 --> 00:08:00.894
[howling]

00:08:09.946 --> 00:08:12.283
He... He won...

00:08:14.388 --> 00:08:16.358
After all that,
he pulled it off...

00:08:16.392 --> 00:08:18.162
Dai really beat him!

00:08:28.683 --> 00:08:31.924
Maam [thought]: I suppose
this is the end for Hadlar.

00:08:31.957 --> 00:08:34.763
He's a Superior Being
like Zamza was,

00:08:34.796 --> 00:08:36.700
and now that he's
been defeated...

00:08:36.734 --> 00:08:40.775
He's going to crumble
into black ash, as well.

00:08:40.808 --> 00:08:44.047
Albinass, I think
I understand...

00:08:44.081 --> 00:08:47.655
I can finally see why you
were willing to give it all up

00:08:47.688 --> 00:08:50.259
to prevent
this from happening.

00:08:55.103 --> 00:08:56.606
Hadlar, I...

00:08:57.776 --> 00:09:00.280
There's no need
to say anything.

00:09:00.313 --> 00:09:02.685
I was certain I
had you cornered,

00:09:02.718 --> 00:09:05.658
and yet I've lost once again.

00:09:05.691 --> 00:09:06.894
No matter what I try,

00:09:06.927 --> 00:09:09.966
I always lose to
Avan and his Disciples.

00:09:11.637 --> 00:09:14.776
But I'm satisfied with
this particular loss...

00:09:14.809 --> 00:09:18.984
To face both his and Baran's
greatest attacks in battle...

00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:20.219
[admiring chuckle]

00:09:20.253 --> 00:09:24.195
I never stood a chance
against such a thing.

00:09:24.228 --> 00:09:25.363
What a way to go.

00:09:25.396 --> 00:09:28.135
Was that another attack you
invented in your training?

00:09:28.169 --> 00:09:29.337
No.

00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:32.244
I actually came up with that
one right here on the spot.

00:09:32.277 --> 00:09:34.181
Just now? Is that so?

00:09:34.215 --> 00:09:35.050
It's true.

00:09:35.083 --> 00:09:36.586
I figured if I was
going to beat you,

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.625
I'd need the combined power
of my master and father.

00:09:39.659 --> 00:09:42.698
I honestly wasn't sure
I could do it, but...

00:09:42.732 --> 00:09:45.704
When it came down
to it, I had to try.

00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:51.750
[laughing]

00:09:51.783 --> 00:09:53.621
At the height of
your toughest battle,

00:09:53.654 --> 00:09:55.490
you've created the
most incredible attack

00:09:55.524 --> 00:09:58.964
the world has ever seen.

00:09:58.997 --> 00:10:02.204
How did I believe I could
have ever defeated you?

00:10:02.237 --> 00:10:04.040
What a fool I was.

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:07.347
I'm sorry, Hadlar...

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.418
Don't be. I have no regrets.

00:10:09.452 --> 00:10:12.257
As a matter of fact,
I'm grateful, boy.

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:13.660
When I was at my lowest,

00:10:13.693 --> 00:10:16.165
and I realized that
I couldn't overcome you,

00:10:16.198 --> 00:10:20.207
that was when an awakening
truly began in my life.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.812
And while it may have
been a short one,

00:10:22.846 --> 00:10:25.817
it was a fulfilling
life, nonetheless.

00:10:27.789 --> 00:10:31.763
Farewell, Dai...
the little Hero.

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.506
For my last wish...

00:10:36.539 --> 00:10:39.780
May I at least shake the hand
of the one who bested me...

00:10:39.813 --> 00:10:42.318
while I still have the time?

00:10:42.351 --> 00:10:43.419
What do you say, Dai?

00:10:43.453 --> 00:10:46.826
It won't be long before
my body will crumble to ash.

00:11:09.271 --> 00:11:10.273
Hadlar: What is this?!

00:11:17.989 --> 00:11:19.391
Hyunckel: What's going on?!

00:11:22.397 --> 00:11:24.234
Wait, a flute? Could it be...

00:11:28.544 --> 00:11:29.946
Hyunckel: Killvearn.

00:11:30.681 --> 00:11:32.083
Killvearn: [chuckling]

00:11:32.117 --> 00:11:35.390
Well, I hope you've enjoyed
yourselves, my friends.

00:11:35.423 --> 00:11:36.793
Like this little melody?

00:11:36.826 --> 00:11:40.099
Let's call it a requiem
from yours truly...

00:11:40.132 --> 00:11:42.003
Played for the pair
who've taken the time

00:11:42.036 --> 00:11:45.410
to put on this
magnificent show.

00:11:45.443 --> 00:11:47.548
Encore, anyone?

00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:48.482
Look out!

00:11:48.517 --> 00:11:49.785
Get away from there!

00:11:53.425 --> 00:11:55.965
No, no... He's too weakened.
He can't even stand.

00:11:55.998 --> 00:11:58.102
Killvearn: Time's up, anyway.

00:11:58.135 --> 00:12:02.244
The mighty fires of the
Underworld will consume them!

00:12:02.277 --> 00:12:03.445
Dai: [alarmed breath]

00:12:05.182 --> 00:12:07.287
Come on, move!

00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:30.701
Killvearn: [chuckling]

00:12:30.734 --> 00:12:32.203
Well, what do you think?

00:12:32.236 --> 00:12:34.475
Isn't my Kill Trap
just splendid?

00:12:34.509 --> 00:12:36.078
So splendid.

00:12:36.111 --> 00:12:37.982
What do you mean "Kill Trap"?

00:12:38.015 --> 00:12:40.386
What does it sound
like, you dummy?

00:12:40.419 --> 00:12:42.625
Killvearn: I've laid
quite a number of traps

00:12:42.658 --> 00:12:45.396
around the palace
to punish intruders...

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:48.035
Some of them are more
primitive than others,

00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:51.510
but this is one
of my favorites.

00:12:51.543 --> 00:12:53.781
The Nine of Diamonds.

00:12:53.814 --> 00:12:55.918
It allows me to
summon the most powerful

00:12:55.951 --> 00:12:58.657
fires of the
Underworld at will.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.261
Truly unparalleled
spell craft.

00:13:01.294 --> 00:13:03.198
It crossed my mind
to activate it

00:13:03.232 --> 00:13:05.771
the moment you all
set foot in Vearn Palace,

00:13:05.804 --> 00:13:08.209
but this is so much more fun.

00:13:08.242 --> 00:13:10.146
Leona [thought]: He was
waiting for this...

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:11.883
Waiting until Dai
and Hadlar were both

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:14.054
too exhausted to fight back.

00:13:14.689 --> 00:13:16.258
You monster.

00:13:16.292 --> 00:13:17.127
How dare you defile

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.231
an honorable duel
with your games?!

00:13:19.264 --> 00:13:20.233
Hyunckel...

00:13:20.267 --> 00:13:23.172
Just forget about
Killvearn right now.

00:13:23.205 --> 00:13:24.609
Let's focus.

00:13:24.642 --> 00:13:25.911
We gotta help Dai.

00:13:25.945 --> 00:13:28.182
Killvearn: It's
futile, young lady.

00:13:28.215 --> 00:13:29.886
Killvearn: Can you
really not see it?

00:13:29.919 --> 00:13:32.892
He's already far
beyond your help.

00:13:32.925 --> 00:13:36.800
Once the eight all-consuming
fires are summoned,

00:13:36.833 --> 00:13:40.006
they'll gather into
a scorching apex...

00:13:40.039 --> 00:13:41.341
and then any living creature

00:13:41.375 --> 00:13:44.147
trapped within will
be incinerated.

00:13:44.181 --> 00:13:47.855
I guarantee, there's no power in
this realm that can escape it.

00:13:47.888 --> 00:13:48.724
He's lying!

00:13:48.757 --> 00:13:49.758
Killvearn: Why would I?

00:13:49.792 --> 00:13:51.730
At least Lord Hadlar
will be pleased-

00:13:51.763 --> 00:13:53.700
he gets to die with the Hero.

00:13:53.734 --> 00:14:00.312
[cackling]

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:03.085
Popp: If I were you,

00:14:03.119 --> 00:14:05.891
I wouldn't assume it'll
go off without a hitch.

00:14:18.617 --> 00:14:19.685
Popp! You...

00:14:19.718 --> 00:14:21.021
You bet, pal.

00:14:21.054 --> 00:14:23.158
I had a feeling that something
like this might happen.

00:14:24.563 --> 00:14:26.031
Surprise, Killvearn.

00:14:26.064 --> 00:14:29.104
As long as I'm in here,
this plan isn't going your way.

00:14:40.961 --> 00:14:42.297
Popp: Surprise, Killvearn.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.269
As long as I'm in here, this
plan isn't going your way.

00:14:45.302 --> 00:14:46.005
Popp, are you...

00:14:46.038 --> 00:14:47.440
Are you in there?!

00:14:47.473 --> 00:14:48.309
That's right.

00:14:48.342 --> 00:14:50.012
It's a little hot,
but Dai's okay.

00:14:50.045 --> 00:14:52.116
Hyunckel: You dove in just
before the trap closed?

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.452
Are you out of your mind?

00:14:53.486 --> 00:14:55.758
Popp: No, but I figured
Vearn and his henchmen

00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:57.995
would try to pull
a fast one on us.

00:14:58.028 --> 00:14:59.932
Sure, Hadlar
and his Royal Guard

00:14:59.965 --> 00:15:01.268
might be honorable opponents,

00:15:01.301 --> 00:15:03.673
but this is Vearn Palace...

00:15:03.707 --> 00:15:05.777
The Dark Army's
headquarters.

00:15:05.811 --> 00:15:09.050
And if you ask me, there's no
such thing as a fair fight

00:15:09.084 --> 00:15:11.388
from a member of
the Dark Army!

00:15:11.421 --> 00:15:13.459
Hadlar [thought]:
Well said, Popp.

00:15:13.493 --> 00:15:14.395
Killvearn: [annoyed scoff]

00:15:14.428 --> 00:15:17.233
This little brat's
always a pain, isn't he?

00:15:19.639 --> 00:15:22.109
Ah, well.
Not for much longer.

00:15:22.945 --> 00:15:24.481
Hyunckel [thought]:
Where did he go?

00:15:24.515 --> 00:15:25.750
It doesn't make sense.

00:15:25.784 --> 00:15:29.759
Why would he disappear when
his plan was just thwarted?

00:15:29.792 --> 00:15:38.443
Popp: [straining grunts]

00:15:38.476 --> 00:15:39.846
It's no use.

00:15:39.879 --> 00:15:41.281
These flames are too strong.

00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:43.887
My Crackle spell won't
hold them off forever...

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.160
Somebody hurry up
and do something!

00:15:47.194 --> 00:15:48.563
Leona: Okay. I've got it.

00:15:49.197 --> 00:15:50.232
Crackle!

00:15:53.874 --> 00:15:54.875
Leona: This isn't good.

00:15:54.909 --> 00:15:57.280
My Crackle spell
isn't strong enough!

00:15:57.314 --> 00:16:00.086
How come? Popp's
is holding it back.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.991
His Magic Power is a lot
stronger than mine is...

00:16:03.025 --> 00:16:04.562
There's nothing I can do.

00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:06.365
[struggling grunts]

00:16:06.398 --> 00:16:07.568
Don't give in!

00:16:07.601 --> 00:16:08.770
Isn't there...

00:16:08.804 --> 00:16:10.740
I mean, there
has to be something.

00:16:10.774 --> 00:16:13.045
At this rate,
they're going to...

00:16:14.114 --> 00:16:17.453
Hyunckel: I've got an idea.
Stand aside, you two.

00:16:19.491 --> 00:16:21.763
Are you going
to use Grand Cross?

00:16:21.796 --> 00:16:22.965
We don't have a choice.

00:16:22.998 --> 00:16:25.436
This trap can't be
broken by normal means.

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:29.579
We'll have to blow it away using
the greatest power we have...

00:16:29.612 --> 00:16:31.048
And that's this.

00:16:31.081 --> 00:16:32.551
In terms of raw energy,

00:16:32.585 --> 00:16:36.692
no other attack can come close
to the force of my Grand Cross!

00:16:39.766 --> 00:16:41.068
You guys,

00:16:41.101 --> 00:16:43.439
Hyunckel's about to try
using Grand Cross to free you.

00:16:43.472 --> 00:16:44.441
Take cover!

00:16:44.475 --> 00:16:45.745
[struggling grunts]

00:16:45.778 --> 00:16:47.447
Right. Brace yourselves.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.520
I expect this one's going
to sting a little bit.

00:16:56.031 --> 00:16:57.668
Hyunckel: Grand Cross!

00:17:22.183 --> 00:17:23.687
I-Impossible...

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.955
Hyunckel: There's no way...

00:17:24.989 --> 00:17:27.393
How could it repel
my attack so easily?

00:17:27.795 --> 00:17:28.830
Hey, uh...

00:17:28.863 --> 00:17:29.932
Was that all?

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:31.669
Because nothing's
happening in here...

00:17:33.071 --> 00:17:34.174
You mean it...

00:17:34.207 --> 00:17:36.411
It didn't have any
effect in there at all?

00:17:36.444 --> 00:17:37.814
It can't be...

00:17:38.917 --> 00:17:40.319
Is that why?

00:17:40.352 --> 00:17:43.794
Is that the real
reason Killvearn left?

00:17:43.827 --> 00:17:44.929
Killvearn: [giggling]

00:17:44.962 --> 00:17:46.966
Don't the humans make
such lovely faces

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.070
when they've been tricked?

00:17:49.103 --> 00:17:51.242
Your cruelty knows no bounds.

00:17:51.275 --> 00:17:55.016
I admit, even my own
nature is no match for it.

00:17:55.049 --> 00:17:57.186
The cruelest being...

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.623
Of the entire Underworld.

00:17:58.656 --> 00:18:01.830
Killvearn: Such high
praise, Your Majesty.

00:18:01.863 --> 00:18:03.633
[devious chuckle]

00:18:06.205 --> 00:18:07.642
Maam: What do we do?

00:18:07.675 --> 00:18:09.410
What can we do here?!

00:18:09.812 --> 00:18:10.848
Leona, please.

00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:11.883
Is there a spell?

00:18:11.916 --> 00:18:13.319
Or some item?

00:18:13.352 --> 00:18:15.958
We can't just stand by and watch
them get burned to death...

00:18:15.991 --> 00:18:18.162
Leona?!

00:18:18.195 --> 00:18:19.666
Hyunckel: You
heard him, Maam...

00:18:19.699 --> 00:18:20.534
Hyunckel: It's futile.

00:18:20.567 --> 00:18:22.137
The Princess has
already figured as much.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:24.207
She's not going to
give you any false hope.

00:18:24.241 --> 00:18:25.811
You know it's true.

00:18:25.844 --> 00:18:29.217
There's not a thing that any
of us can do to help them now.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:30.887
No, you're wrong!

00:18:35.062 --> 00:18:36.165
Leona: Grand Cross has

00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:38.202
the greatest Aura
energy of any attack,

00:18:38.235 --> 00:18:40.306
and even it couldn't
quench those flames.

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:41.709
If I'm right,
then that means

00:18:41.743 --> 00:18:44.782
this trap can only be broken
using some type of magic...

00:18:44.816 --> 00:18:47.386
It isn't going to
respond to anything else.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.957
That's the only
thing that explains

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:51.028
why Hyunckel's strike
had no effect...

00:18:51.061 --> 00:18:53.633
Because it's Aura, not magic.

00:18:53.666 --> 00:18:56.873
Hyunckel: Inside, Popp might
be able to hold off that fire

00:18:56.906 --> 00:18:59.211
using the power he has, but...

00:18:59.244 --> 00:19:00.680
Out here, none of us are

00:19:00.714 --> 00:19:02.450
anywhere close to
having his abilities

00:19:02.484 --> 00:19:03.920
when it comes to magic...

00:19:03.953 --> 00:19:07.093
That leaves us with only
one way to rescue our friends

00:19:07.126 --> 00:19:09.632
before they're
consumed by the flames...

00:19:09.666 --> 00:19:10.667
Defeating Killvearn.

00:19:10.701 --> 00:19:14.140
If we do that, then his
spell should disappear.

00:19:14.173 --> 00:19:17.949
And of course, he expected
us to figure that out.

00:19:17.982 --> 00:19:19.785
That's why he retreated.

00:19:19.818 --> 00:19:22.624
He could be anywhere now.
This palace is enormous.

00:19:22.658 --> 00:19:24.529
Hyunckel: It would
take us far too long

00:19:24.562 --> 00:19:26.097
to find him and defeat him.

00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:27.734
He's worked out
all the angles,

00:19:27.768 --> 00:19:30.373
and he's closed off our
only hope of saving them...

00:19:30.406 --> 00:19:32.711
That diabolical specter.

00:19:42.497 --> 00:19:43.866
Maam [thought]: He's right.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.839
Even combined, Leona and I
don't have the Magic Power...

00:19:48.576 --> 00:19:51.415
Leona - what
about Kaglimmer?

00:19:51.448 --> 00:19:53.619
It worked in the
Cave of Trials, didn't it?

00:19:53.653 --> 00:19:55.356
And it wasn't
even complete...

00:19:55.389 --> 00:19:57.093
Why don't we try
casting it again?

00:19:57.127 --> 00:19:58.764
Maybe it'll do the trick.

00:19:58.797 --> 00:20:02.203
It's a good idea,
but... it won't work.

00:20:03.305 --> 00:20:05.777
Leona: I wish I were wrong,
but don't forget...

00:20:05.811 --> 00:20:08.717
In order to bring down the
field surrounding the palace...

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:12.625
we already... cast a
full-scale Kaglimmer Spell.

00:20:12.658 --> 00:20:15.697
This place, it's
under that enchantment.

00:20:15.731 --> 00:20:18.435
If it could stop these
flames, it would have.

00:20:19.337 --> 00:20:20.907
Purification Spells, they...

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.613
They aren't more effective
if they're cast again...

00:20:23.647 --> 00:20:26.619
It'd just be a waste
of Magic Power.

00:20:28.957 --> 00:20:30.092
H-How can...

00:20:30.125 --> 00:20:32.097
How can you be
so calm right now?

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:33.098
Leona!

00:20:33.131 --> 00:20:35.035
Oh, I am not calm.

00:20:46.224 --> 00:20:47.628
But still...

00:20:47.661 --> 00:20:51.335
We can't afford to lose
our heads at a time like this.

00:20:51.368 --> 00:20:53.573
We have to focus
and figure out a way.

00:20:53.606 --> 00:20:55.944
Otherwise, this
will all be for nothing.

00:20:57.247 --> 00:21:01.288
Our enemy, he's way too
many steps ahead of us.

00:21:01.321 --> 00:21:04.293
He's pulled us apart
without even being here.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.546
Maam [thought]:
Forgive me, Leona.

00:21:21.729 --> 00:21:23.432
Hyunckel: There's
no point, Maam.

00:21:23.465 --> 00:21:25.202
You're wasting your strength.

00:21:25.236 --> 00:21:27.541
Physical power is
never going to work.

00:21:27.575 --> 00:21:29.712
If your fists or
my Wave Strike

00:21:29.745 --> 00:21:31.448
could have any
effect on this trap...

00:21:31.481 --> 00:21:33.452
then Killvearn would
have taken us both out

00:21:33.485 --> 00:21:35.389
before he pulled
his vanishing act.

00:21:36.424 --> 00:21:38.128
Maam [thought]:
Just hang on, you guys.

00:21:38.161 --> 00:21:40.466
Don't give up on me in there!

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.740
Killvearn: They do love
their futile resistance.

00:21:43.774 --> 00:21:45.409
[delighted chuckle]

00:23:37.601 --> 00:23:39.004
Narrator: With
the other Disciples

00:23:39.037 --> 00:23:40.138
helpless to rescue them,

00:23:40.172 --> 00:23:42.945
Dai and Popp are locked
inside of Killvearn's trap.

00:23:42.978 --> 00:23:44.848
The Underworld's
fire scorches the air,

00:23:44.882 --> 00:23:49.057
their stamina is failing,
and soon any hope seems lost...

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:52.429
Until an unexpected ray of light
breaks through the darkness,

00:23:52.463 --> 00:23:54.334
leading Popp to
a possible exit.

00:23:54.367 --> 00:23:55.469
But will they escape before

00:23:55.504 --> 00:23:57.474
the raging inferno
swallows them whole?

00:23:57.508 --> 00:23:58.643
