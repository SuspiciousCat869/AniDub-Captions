WEBVTT

00:01:51.857 --> 00:01:55.064
Popp: So that was a combat
machine from the Underworld...

00:01:55.097 --> 00:01:57.335
and Killvearn used
it to drag master Avan

00:01:57.368 --> 00:01:59.238
into another dimension?

00:01:59.272 --> 00:02:01.375
Mystvearn: With a Judge
presiding over the duel,

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.713
they can't be interrupted.

00:02:02.746 --> 00:02:05.050
Your master will
have to fend for himself.

00:02:05.084 --> 00:02:08.290
They'll stay in that realm until
one of them defeats the other.

00:02:08.323 --> 00:02:10.193
The Judge will then
dispose of the loser,

00:02:10.226 --> 00:02:12.497
and transport the victor
back to this world.

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:14.804
After that, it will
self-destruct.

00:02:14.837 --> 00:02:16.773
What do we have to do?

00:02:16.807 --> 00:02:19.279
There must be a way -
either to get him out,

00:02:19.312 --> 00:02:20.815
or to go in after him...

00:02:20.848 --> 00:02:22.317
So tell us.

00:02:24.222 --> 00:02:25.792
Mystvearn: [chuckling]

00:02:25.825 --> 00:02:27.595
I suppose anything's possible,

00:02:27.628 --> 00:02:29.532
but even if I knew
such a thing...

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:32.004
Do you really think
I'd tell you?

00:02:32.037 --> 00:02:34.108
Dai: Yeah, I thought
you might say that.

00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:35.277
So if you know...

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.582
We're going to have to
force it out of you.

00:02:39.218 --> 00:02:40.254
I hope you're ready...

00:02:40.287 --> 00:02:41.924
'Cause I'm not holding back.

00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.493
Leona: Dai. Hang on.

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:47.969
He's only taunting you.
Think about it.

00:02:48.003 --> 00:02:49.606
Considering
everything he just said,

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:51.710
I don't see how
we could get him out.

00:02:51.743 --> 00:02:55.183
Nothing escapes a Judge...
not even Master Avan.

00:02:55.217 --> 00:02:57.021
I've read about
these machines.

00:02:57.054 --> 00:02:58.356
They've been used
to settle disputes

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.728
in the Underworld
since ancient times.

00:03:00.762 --> 00:03:03.033
The whole point is to
keep the outside world

00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:04.636
from getting in the way.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.540
And so that means...

00:03:06.573 --> 00:03:09.112
He's pretending to know
so you'll fight him.

00:03:09.145 --> 00:03:11.216
It gives him a chance
to do some damage.

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:13.319
So that by the time
you face King Vearn,

00:03:13.353 --> 00:03:15.524
you're already exhausted.

00:03:15.558 --> 00:03:17.896
That way, even
if Mystvearn loses,

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:19.232
he'll still have won his king

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:21.537
the upper hand
for the final battle.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.007
We can't afford to
fall for another trick.

00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:25.645
Master Avan can
handle himself.

00:03:25.678 --> 00:03:27.749
We need to stay
focused and get Dai to

00:03:27.782 --> 00:03:30.888
the Dark King's inner
sanctum as soon as we can.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.463
Maam: Leona...
that's pretty cold...

00:03:43.146 --> 00:03:44.515
Maam's got a point.

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.622
I mean, I know everything you're
saying is right. But, I...

00:03:47.656 --> 00:03:51.462
With Master Avan in danger,
we can't just walk away.

00:03:53.868 --> 00:03:56.907
How can you expect us to
abandon him like that?

00:03:58.376 --> 00:04:00.480
But, Maam - we...

00:04:00.515 --> 00:04:01.617
Dai [thought]:
They're both right.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.554
Besides, it's not
like Mystvearn is

00:04:03.588 --> 00:04:06.258
just gonna let us
run away from here.

00:04:09.398 --> 00:04:11.302
Mystvearn: [chuckling]

00:04:11.336 --> 00:04:14.843
I'd expect nothing less
from the Disciples of Avan.

00:04:14.877 --> 00:04:16.880
Now, shall we begin?

00:04:19.285 --> 00:04:20.487
Wait!

00:04:21.924 --> 00:04:23.059
Dai, don't do this!

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:29.471
[roaring]

00:04:42.398 --> 00:04:43.867
Wait - isn't that...

00:04:55.157 --> 00:04:57.895
That's one of Master
Avan's Feathers!

00:05:05.745 --> 00:05:06.713
L-Leona?

00:05:06.747 --> 00:05:08.918
I don't get it. Why does
the Princess have those?

00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:10.086
They're Master's.

00:05:14.128 --> 00:05:17.668
Killvearn: You should know
better than to underestimate me.

00:05:17.702 --> 00:05:22.010
Did you honestly believe I was
going to let you beat me twice?

00:05:22.044 --> 00:05:25.283
I had such high
hopes for you...

00:05:25.317 --> 00:05:28.624
But now, it all
comes to an end!

00:05:38.877 --> 00:05:41.348
Killvearn: Ah,
the mighty Avan Strash,

00:05:41.382 --> 00:05:43.186
from the creator himself.

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:44.556
Judge: Compiling results...

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.824
Avan's attack yields

00:05:45.858 --> 00:05:48.129
seventy-eight
damage to Killvearn.

00:05:48.163 --> 00:05:49.332
Killvearn: Seventy-eight?

00:05:49.365 --> 00:05:51.970
That much damage
from a single scratch?

00:05:54.007 --> 00:05:56.212
Then, when we first fought...

00:05:56.245 --> 00:05:57.314
That's right.

00:05:57.348 --> 00:05:59.318
If I had really wanted to,

00:05:59.352 --> 00:06:01.222
I could've done a
lot worse than just

00:06:01.255 --> 00:06:03.459
damaging your mask back there.

00:06:03.492 --> 00:06:04.930
Avan: Perhaps it
looked like mercy,

00:06:04.963 --> 00:06:07.034
but it was really
a matter of strategy.

00:06:07.067 --> 00:06:09.873
First of all, I didn't want
to expend all of my energy

00:06:09.906 --> 00:06:12.477
until I knew the others could
reach the inner sanctum.

00:06:12.511 --> 00:06:13.747
And secondly,

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.085
I wanted to make sure that
you wouldn't stop them.

00:06:16.118 --> 00:06:20.895
So I needed your anger
directed at me - and me alone.

00:06:20.928 --> 00:06:23.601
Avan: I may be trapped
in here, but you are too.

00:06:23.634 --> 00:06:25.303
Exactly as I intended.

00:06:25.336 --> 00:06:27.440
It was you who
underestimated me.

00:06:27.474 --> 00:06:30.113
I can stay in here
fighting you for eternity,

00:06:30.146 --> 00:06:31.349
if I have to.

00:06:31.382 --> 00:06:32.585
And even if you beat me,

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:34.488
it won't change what
Dai and the others

00:06:34.522 --> 00:06:36.359
can accomplish in
the meantime.

00:06:36.392 --> 00:06:37.962
In any case,

00:06:37.996 --> 00:06:41.202
I've already appointed my
successor and told her my plan.

00:06:41.235 --> 00:06:42.304
Now that we're in here,

00:06:42.337 --> 00:06:44.408
she'll know it's
time to put it in motion.

00:06:44.441 --> 00:06:46.413
Killvearn:
Your successor, huh?

00:06:46.446 --> 00:06:48.115
And who would that be?

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:52.190
The only one who's able
to rally the entire group,

00:06:52.224 --> 00:06:56.199
and unite them under the banner
of justice and righteousness...

00:06:56.232 --> 00:06:58.905
is you, Your Highness.

00:06:58.938 --> 00:07:01.041
You were born to lead.

00:07:03.112 --> 00:07:05.751
Avan: Leona, I leave it to you.

00:07:09.593 --> 00:07:10.795
Leona: Listen up, everyone.

00:07:10.828 --> 00:07:12.965
Master Avan was planning
for this to happen.

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:14.869
He gave me his
feathers and told me

00:07:14.902 --> 00:07:16.706
to take over if
he was captured...

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.311
To lead his disciples
all the way to victory,

00:07:19.345 --> 00:07:20.981
no matter the cost.

00:07:21.015 --> 00:07:23.185
So in the name of
the great Hero Avan,

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:26.091
to defend the surface world
and fight for justice...

00:07:26.125 --> 00:07:31.202
I, Princess Leona, am taking
command of this party.

00:07:31.235 --> 00:07:35.811
I hereby order all of you...
to fight on for the Hero!

00:07:38.215 --> 00:07:43.828
Avan: Yes, exactly. All of
you must fight for the Hero.

00:07:43.861 --> 00:07:48.369
Uh... Okay, but,
w-what does that mean?

00:07:48.403 --> 00:07:49.873
It all comes down to Dai.

00:07:49.906 --> 00:07:52.478
If I'm taken captive,
the clock starts ticking.

00:07:52.512 --> 00:07:53.780
From that moment forth,

00:07:53.814 --> 00:07:55.918
everything rests on getting
Dai to Vearn's sanctum

00:07:55.951 --> 00:07:58.724
with as much strength and
stamina as he can muster.

00:07:58.757 --> 00:08:00.093
He's going to need it.

00:08:00.126 --> 00:08:02.130
You and the remaining party
members will have to focus

00:08:02.164 --> 00:08:05.938
all of your efforts on
achieving this single goal.

00:08:05.971 --> 00:08:07.474
It's likely
that the Dark King

00:08:07.508 --> 00:08:10.514
possesses power beyond
our imaginations...

00:08:10.548 --> 00:08:12.450
A full-powered strike
from the Hero's blade

00:08:12.484 --> 00:08:14.288
is our surest
weapon against him.

00:08:14.321 --> 00:08:15.758
Understand?

00:08:16.794 --> 00:08:18.429
I've seen it work before.

00:08:18.463 --> 00:08:20.735
In the old days,
when I faced Hadlar,

00:08:20.768 --> 00:08:22.672
my friends did
everything they could

00:08:22.705 --> 00:08:25.143
to keep the path clear
while I made my way

00:08:25.176 --> 00:08:27.213
to the Dark Lord's chambers.

00:08:28.917 --> 00:08:30.888
Roka: Forget about me,
Avan. Go, now!

00:08:30.921 --> 00:08:32.424
Young Leira:
We'll fend them off.

00:08:32.457 --> 00:08:33.794
Good luck to you, my friend.

00:08:33.827 --> 00:08:37.067
Matoriv: Enough chit-chat.
Go demolish that Dark Lord.

00:08:40.574 --> 00:08:42.679
Avan: My disciples have
some of the kindest hearts

00:08:42.712 --> 00:08:44.448
I've ever encountered.

00:08:44.481 --> 00:08:46.887
It's a wonderful quality
to find in a person.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.126
But we're at war,
and war can be cruel.

00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:51.162
Make no mistake,

00:08:51.195 --> 00:08:53.700
there will be times
ahead that seem hopeless,

00:08:53.734 --> 00:08:55.604
but you'll have to
wipe away your tears

00:08:55.638 --> 00:08:57.875
and focus on
achieving the victory.

00:08:57.908 --> 00:08:58.744
When it's time,

00:08:58.777 --> 00:09:00.982
it's your job to
keep everyone moving.

00:09:01.015 --> 00:09:01.950
Princess...

00:09:01.983 --> 00:09:04.322
I know that you
can achieve this.

00:09:04.355 --> 00:09:05.891
You have that strength.

00:09:07.328 --> 00:09:10.333
Only me? Are you... sure?

00:09:10.366 --> 00:09:11.603
Are you surprised?

00:09:11.636 --> 00:09:14.241
You've proven to have
a firm belief in justice.

00:09:14.274 --> 00:09:17.280
Not to mention, you certainly
have experience leading.

00:09:17.313 --> 00:09:19.986
You'll have what it takes
to make the hard decisions.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:23.560
Even though occasionally you'll
be at odds with your friends.

00:09:23.593 --> 00:09:25.463
You can do what must be done.

00:09:25.496 --> 00:09:28.303
You can lead people down
that difficult path.

00:09:28.336 --> 00:09:31.910
And as if that weren't enough,
you're also very brave.

00:09:31.943 --> 00:09:34.415
I'd follow someone like
that, wouldn't you?

00:09:34.448 --> 00:09:35.885
So, take these feathers.

00:09:35.918 --> 00:09:37.722
If we're cornered by
another powerful enemy

00:09:37.755 --> 00:09:39.358
before we reach the Dark King,

00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:41.262
I'll fend them
off the same way that

00:09:41.295 --> 00:09:43.032
Hyunckel did on our way in.

00:09:44.703 --> 00:09:46.205
Avan: I doubt
they'll question it,

00:09:46.239 --> 00:09:47.474
but if Popp gets excited,

00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:50.581
you can show him the Feathers
as a token of my faith in you.

00:09:50.615 --> 00:09:52.217
I'm only trying
to be prepared.

00:09:52.251 --> 00:09:55.356
And I'm sorry. I know
it's a rather big favor.

00:09:55.389 --> 00:09:57.761
Leona: No, I... I'm relieved.

00:09:58.564 --> 00:09:59.666
Honestly?

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.802
For a second there,

00:10:00.835 --> 00:10:02.572
I thought that maybe
you were planning to

00:10:02.605 --> 00:10:05.109
sacrifice yourself
for Dai again.

00:10:06.513 --> 00:10:08.048
Sacrifice?

00:10:08.784 --> 00:10:10.253
Of course not, Your Highness!

00:10:10.287 --> 00:10:12.725
I merely brought you along
because I thought you'd prefer

00:10:12.759 --> 00:10:14.963
to have this
conversation in private.

00:10:14.996 --> 00:10:18.403
I'll tell you this, I'm not
in any rush to die again,

00:10:18.436 --> 00:10:19.639
not for a long while.

00:10:19.672 --> 00:10:21.141
And if you want proof of that,

00:10:21.175 --> 00:10:23.212
I only gave you
half of my feathers.

00:10:23.246 --> 00:10:25.684
Just enough to be ready
for whatever happens.

00:10:25.718 --> 00:10:27.020
Sacrifice-

00:10:27.054 --> 00:10:28.890
[laughing]

00:10:28.924 --> 00:10:31.495
My apologies. I didn't mean
to worry you like that.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:34.869
Obviously, there's still a
large amount of risk involved.

00:10:34.903 --> 00:10:38.911
Rest assured... I don't
plan on going anywhere.

00:10:38.944 --> 00:10:41.616
Leona: If I'm going to risk
everything there is for victory,

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.319
it will be "for the Hero."

00:10:45.624 --> 00:10:47.160
That right?

00:10:51.168 --> 00:10:52.972
Avan: Come along.
No time to waste.

00:10:53.005 --> 00:10:55.711
I'll teach you how to deactivate
magical traps along the way.

00:10:55.744 --> 00:10:57.615
Doesn't that sound like fun?

00:10:57.648 --> 00:10:59.084
Leona: Does it?

00:11:01.221 --> 00:11:02.457
So, you see...

00:11:02.491 --> 00:11:04.662
Master didn't
give me these...

00:11:04.695 --> 00:11:07.201
just to use as
weapons in battle.

00:11:07.234 --> 00:11:09.438
He left them to me as
a beacon of hope,

00:11:09.471 --> 00:11:12.979
a torch to carry as I lead
the Disciples of Justice.

00:11:13.012 --> 00:11:16.018
Avan fights on for
Dai even as we speak.

00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:19.257
Now it's time for us
to fight along with him.

00:11:20.293 --> 00:11:21.896
Dai [thought]: Master is...

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:25.337
Everyone is...
fighting for me?

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.373
Maam [thought]: Mom, Dad,
and Uncle Matoriv...

00:11:27.407 --> 00:11:28.710
They all worked
together to help

00:11:28.744 --> 00:11:30.547
Master Avan get
to Lord Hadlar;

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.551
they didn't
face him themselves.

00:11:32.585 --> 00:11:34.689
We need to keep
Mystvearn busy.

00:11:34.722 --> 00:11:36.058
Popp [thought]: That
means splitting up...

00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:38.162
If we want to call
ourselves the Hero's Party,

00:11:38.196 --> 00:11:40.868
it's a good idea to
take notes from the last one.

00:11:40.901 --> 00:11:42.404
But if we don't take our shot,

00:11:42.437 --> 00:11:45.944
it means Master Avan's
fighting for nothing right now.

00:11:47.013 --> 00:11:48.684
Mystvearn: You can shout
anything you like,

00:11:48.717 --> 00:11:50.119
Your Highness...

00:11:52.592 --> 00:11:54.996
This Hero stays right here.

00:12:06.418 --> 00:12:07.420
You okay, Popp?

00:12:07.454 --> 00:12:08.924
Popp: Oh, I'm just peachy.

00:12:08.957 --> 00:12:10.661
Get going. I'll hold him off!

00:12:10.694 --> 00:12:11.797
No, but-

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.265
Yeah, yeah.

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:16.038
I might be a little outmatched
here, but I'll do what I can.

00:12:16.072 --> 00:12:17.808
You know that
I'm stubborn enough

00:12:17.842 --> 00:12:19.780
to punch above my weight.

00:12:19.813 --> 00:12:22.818
I may not be as good
as Avan or Matoriv,

00:12:22.851 --> 00:12:25.991
but I know I can at least
do what Hyunckel did, right?

00:12:26.024 --> 00:12:28.563
I've got my own
reasons for doing it.

00:12:28.597 --> 00:12:30.099
Now get out of here.

00:12:33.507 --> 00:12:34.609
Oh, come on!

00:12:34.642 --> 00:12:36.145
You think I don't see
what you're up to?

00:12:36.178 --> 00:12:38.984
If you want me to fall in
love with you, be yourself,

00:12:39.017 --> 00:12:41.388
don't start trying
to act like Hyunckel.

00:12:41.422 --> 00:12:42.559
I wasn't!

00:12:42.592 --> 00:12:44.160
Ugh, just save it for later.

00:12:44.194 --> 00:12:47.266
You want to impress me?
Show me what you're made of!

00:12:48.971 --> 00:12:49.940
Popp [thought]: Let's think.

00:12:49.973 --> 00:12:51.208
Mystvearn can deflect spells

00:12:51.241 --> 00:12:53.179
that come at him
from straight on.

00:12:53.212 --> 00:12:54.247
But maybe...

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.387
if I have Maam backing me
up with her strength...

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.327
Alright. You're lucky I
need your help, you know.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.365
A guy can only be
belittled so many times.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.376
I guess that settles it.

00:13:08.409 --> 00:13:10.948
Maam and I will stay
and handle conehead here.

00:13:10.982 --> 00:13:12.384
You two go ahead with Dai,

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:15.389
and make sure he doesn't
do anything stupid.

00:13:16.291 --> 00:13:17.294
You heard him.

00:13:17.327 --> 00:13:18.997
Dai [thought]: Master,
Popp, and Maam are

00:13:19.031 --> 00:13:22.505
all putting themselves on the
line so that I can keep going.

00:13:22.538 --> 00:13:24.474
I can't let them down.

00:13:24.508 --> 00:13:25.778
Well, then...

00:13:25.811 --> 00:13:28.617
Looks like it's now or
never you guys. You ready?

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.119
King Vearn is waiting.

00:14:03.553 --> 00:14:05.991
Mystvearn: Not so fast, Dai.

00:14:12.303 --> 00:14:13.172
Are you certain?

00:14:13.205 --> 00:14:14.875
If you leave
your friends now,

00:14:14.909 --> 00:14:17.347
it could be the last
time you ever see each other.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:20.887
You won't be able
to defend them from me.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.899
Mystvearn: Do you think
it will be worth it?

00:14:36.485 --> 00:14:38.455
Don't listen to this joker.

00:14:38.489 --> 00:14:39.457
After coming all this way

00:14:39.491 --> 00:14:42.197
I think we can take care
of ourselves. Alright?

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.905
Leona? I hope you
can forgive me.

00:14:45.938 --> 00:14:47.908
I was quick to judge.

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:51.916
Try to keep Dai out of
trouble for me, will you?

00:14:54.556 --> 00:14:55.691
We're off.

00:14:55.724 --> 00:14:58.328
Oh... R-Right.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.469
Mystvearn: Go ahead, then.

00:15:01.503 --> 00:15:02.704
You won't get very far

00:15:02.738 --> 00:15:06.345
before your friends' screams
halt you in your tracks.

00:15:06.379 --> 00:15:11.455
Then, you'll come
straight back to me.

00:15:11.489 --> 00:15:12.691
[chuckle]

00:15:12.725 --> 00:15:14.127
And now...

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.033
let's show him the combined
strength of the lovers-to-be,

00:15:17.066 --> 00:15:18.068
shall we, darling?

00:15:18.101 --> 00:15:20.540
But first...
Kiss for good luck?

00:15:21.809 --> 00:15:23.947
You have gotten
way ahead of yourself.

00:15:23.981 --> 00:15:25.784
Eyes forward, dummy.

00:15:25.817 --> 00:15:28.824
It sounds like Popp and Maam are
starting to work things out.

00:15:28.857 --> 00:15:30.995
They make a nice item,
don't you think?

00:15:31.028 --> 00:15:33.065
I wouldn't worry about them.

00:15:36.471 --> 00:15:37.942
It's nothing.

00:15:37.975 --> 00:15:39.244
Dai [thought]:
I wouldn't be worried

00:15:39.278 --> 00:15:41.650
if they were facing
any normal enemy.

00:15:41.683 --> 00:15:43.452
But this is Mystvearn,

00:15:43.486 --> 00:15:46.960
the last pillar of
the Dark King's defenses.

00:15:46.993 --> 00:15:48.295
Don't you worry.

00:15:48.328 --> 00:15:50.968
The two of us can still
give you plenty of fight.

00:15:51.002 --> 00:15:52.203
You'll regret this.

00:15:52.237 --> 00:15:54.542
Hey, by the way,
what's the plan?

00:15:54.575 --> 00:15:57.748
You get him distracted and
I'll take care of the rest.

00:15:59.084 --> 00:16:01.055
Okay, I see how it is.

00:16:01.088 --> 00:16:03.225
Still don't think
I'm strong enough, huh?

00:16:03.259 --> 00:16:05.263
You sure are a
tough one to please.

00:16:05.296 --> 00:16:07.400
It's not a
question of strength.

00:16:07.434 --> 00:16:10.105
If you cast Medroa, I doubt
he could deflect it...

00:16:10.139 --> 00:16:12.678
But if the Mirror of Shahal
could, you never know.

00:16:12.711 --> 00:16:15.450
It's better not to risk it.

00:16:15.483 --> 00:16:18.422
More importantly, I'm pretty
sure if I use my Refractor Fist,

00:16:18.456 --> 00:16:20.828
a direct hit will
level enough damage

00:16:20.861 --> 00:16:22.732
to take him down,
once and for all.

00:16:22.765 --> 00:16:24.500
Wait - Refractor Fist?

00:16:25.737 --> 00:16:27.074
Maam: Underneath
Mystvearn's cloak,

00:16:27.107 --> 00:16:29.211
I don't know if it
was human or Darkling,

00:16:29.244 --> 00:16:31.214
but I saw a face like ours.

00:16:31.248 --> 00:16:34.522
That means he's not just some
being made out of evil energy...

00:16:34.555 --> 00:16:37.326
but a living thing
made of flesh and bone.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.966
I could be wrong, but I
think without that mask,

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:42.871
his true form is vulnerable.

00:16:42.905 --> 00:16:44.441
Sounds easy enough.

00:16:44.475 --> 00:16:45.644
Okay. That's a plan.

00:16:45.677 --> 00:16:47.814
I'll conjure some spells
to keep him busy...

00:16:47.848 --> 00:16:49.351
Maam: And I'll tear
off his cloak,

00:16:49.384 --> 00:16:51.054
then hit him with
my Refractor Fist.

00:16:51.087 --> 00:16:52.758
Let's get it right
the first time.

00:16:52.791 --> 00:16:54.361
Loud and clear.

00:16:54.394 --> 00:16:55.997
It's simple but effective -

00:16:56.031 --> 00:16:58.069
I betcha he won't
see this one coming.

00:16:58.102 --> 00:17:00.073
Time for payback.

00:17:00.106 --> 00:17:01.174
Mystvearn: [chuckling]

00:17:01.208 --> 00:17:02.845
Do you really think
you're in control?

00:17:02.879 --> 00:17:04.582
You ignorant little fools.

00:17:04.615 --> 00:17:06.586
I could easily go
after your friend,

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:09.224
but I gave you my
word that the White Garden

00:17:09.258 --> 00:17:10.292
would be your grave.

00:17:10.326 --> 00:17:13.131
It's the only place
to bury a Hero.

00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:15.103
I'll simply persuade
him to return...

00:17:15.136 --> 00:17:17.340
Once he hears you
both crying for help,

00:17:17.373 --> 00:17:19.645
I'm sure he'll come running.

00:17:20.981 --> 00:17:22.350
Save it, pal.

00:17:22.384 --> 00:17:25.222
Yeah, there's still a long
way to go between now and then.

00:17:25.256 --> 00:17:27.928
You may be the strongest
soldier the Dark Army's got,

00:17:27.962 --> 00:17:29.264
and you sure are clever...

00:17:29.298 --> 00:17:30.868
But no matter
what, you won't-

00:17:30.901 --> 00:17:32.303
Mystvearn: "...win so easily.

00:17:32.336 --> 00:17:34.308
We'll hold out,
and Dai will prevail."

00:17:34.341 --> 00:17:36.444
Something along those lines?

00:17:37.347 --> 00:17:39.051
Mystvearn: [chuckling]

00:17:39.084 --> 00:17:42.157
Now you're the
ones making me laugh.

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:45.162
Perhaps someone of Lon Beruk's
ability could succeed...

00:17:45.196 --> 00:17:49.204
But you two barely even
serve as a distraction.

00:17:49.237 --> 00:17:51.174
This is my prediction:

00:17:51.207 --> 00:17:53.880
I'm going to have you
both in a whimpering heap

00:17:53.913 --> 00:17:55.617
without taking a single step.

00:17:55.651 --> 00:17:59.458
I'll keep you alive just long
enough to lure Dai back here...

00:17:59.491 --> 00:18:02.698
And do away with all
of you in one fell swoop.

00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:04.367
You've thought it all through.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.475
The only problem is, things
have a way of rarely going...

00:18:09.211 --> 00:18:11.716
exactly as you plan them!

00:18:13.152 --> 00:18:15.657
Mystvearn: Dark
Puppetry Aura Hand!

00:18:26.478 --> 00:18:27.413
Not this time.

00:18:27.446 --> 00:18:29.384
I'm getting tired of
your old parlor tricks.

00:18:29.417 --> 00:18:30.721
Once you know how they work,

00:18:30.754 --> 00:18:33.459
it's just a matter of finding
the right counter spell.

00:18:33.492 --> 00:18:35.229
For example...

00:18:37.133 --> 00:18:38.435
Bang!

00:18:45.517 --> 00:18:47.521
Mystvearn: What
paltry incantations.

00:18:47.555 --> 00:18:50.927
Hardly worth the effort
of absorbing and deflecting.

00:18:52.397 --> 00:18:54.535
I know they're
nothing special.

00:18:54.568 --> 00:18:56.639
I'll definitely
never beat you with 'em.

00:18:56.673 --> 00:18:59.645
Good thing I'm only playing
the distraction, right?

00:19:12.805 --> 00:19:17.413
Maam! Do it!

00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:19.952
[roaring]

00:19:21.388 --> 00:19:25.496
Here goes nothing...
Refractor Fist!

00:19:36.753 --> 00:19:37.921
She did it!

00:19:42.831 --> 00:19:44.267
Oh no!

00:19:45.069 --> 00:19:46.739
W-Wha...

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.916
[pained yell]

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:53.285
No, Maam!

00:20:00.834 --> 00:20:03.338
You guys, don't give in!

00:20:06.211 --> 00:20:07.280
[amused chuckle]

00:20:07.313 --> 00:20:09.050
Maam [thought]:
It doesn't make sense...

00:20:09.083 --> 00:20:10.386
There's no way
my Refractor Fist

00:20:10.419 --> 00:20:13.258
wouldn't work on something
with a physical body!

00:20:13.893 --> 00:20:16.699
[pained cry]

00:20:16.732 --> 00:20:18.803
[agonized groan]

00:20:18.837 --> 00:20:21.810
Popp [thought]: I can't
breathe... Can't breathe...

00:20:21.843 --> 00:20:23.345
Hang on!

00:20:24.515 --> 00:20:26.719
Popp: No! Forget
about us. Keep going!

00:20:26.752 --> 00:20:29.324
Get to King Vearn
and make it count.

00:20:29.357 --> 00:20:31.294
It's all that matters!

00:20:35.036 --> 00:20:36.305
Popp [thought]: No...

00:20:36.338 --> 00:20:39.144
He was letting up just enough
that we would cry out...

00:20:39.177 --> 00:20:43.853
He knew that if Dai heard us,
he would come to our rescue.

00:20:45.256 --> 00:20:48.495
[pained cry]

00:20:48.529 --> 00:20:50.032
Popp [thought]:
But once Dai gets here,

00:20:50.066 --> 00:20:52.738
Mystvearn is going to
get rid of all three of us.

00:20:52.771 --> 00:20:56.044
If he does that, it could
cost us the final battle.

00:20:58.215 --> 00:21:00.887
Seems my prediction
came true after all.

00:21:02.691 --> 00:21:04.829
Popp: No, Dai...

00:21:04.862 --> 00:21:07.200
Don't come back here!

00:21:07.233 --> 00:21:11.208
I'm begging you, don't!

00:21:11.241 --> 00:21:17.988
Mystvearn: [laughing]

00:21:49.217 --> 00:21:51.355
Maam [thought]: Hyunckel.

00:21:51.388 --> 00:21:54.895
Popp [thought]: Somehow,
he... he survived.

00:21:56.465 --> 00:21:58.401
No, wait... It's...

00:21:58.937 --> 00:22:00.673
Are you kidding me?

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.001
Narrator: "All of us
must fight for the Hero."

00:23:38.035 --> 00:23:39.303
Leona's command has

00:23:39.337 --> 00:23:40.907
bolstered the party
to risk it all

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:43.211
as they charge toward
the final confrontation...

00:23:43.245 --> 00:23:45.984
And right before Mystvearn
can finish off Popp and Maam,

00:23:46.017 --> 00:23:48.956
Larhart arrives armed
with the Dark Armor Spear,

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:50.794
rescuing the
pair from their fate.

00:23:50.827 --> 00:23:52.430
While the Disciples
catch their breath,

00:23:52.463 --> 00:23:54.601
Larhart tells of
his promise to Baran,

00:23:54.635 --> 00:23:57.172
and Dai receives a final
message from his father.

00:23:57.206 --> 00:23:58.943
See how it all
unfolds next time on

00:23:58.976 --> 00:24:01.281
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:01.315 --> 00:24:03.151
"Baran's Last Will".
