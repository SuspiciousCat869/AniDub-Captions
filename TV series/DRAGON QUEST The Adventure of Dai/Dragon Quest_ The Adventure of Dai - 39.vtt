WEBVTT

00:01:54.395 --> 00:01:56.566
Welcome to Papnica,
King Romos.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.541
Princess Leona! This summit
was an excellent idea.

00:02:04.181 --> 00:02:05.685
Wait, that's...

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.795
Crocodine, he is...

00:02:10.828 --> 00:02:14.570
I see. This one is a
friend of Dai's now, is he?

00:02:14.603 --> 00:02:16.172
Yes, that's right.

00:02:18.243 --> 00:02:19.913
King Romos! Your Majesty!

00:02:19.946 --> 00:02:21.951
Look! The Crown of Champions.

00:02:21.984 --> 00:02:23.487
Can we turn this into a weapon?

00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:26.760
We need to make a sword
out of Orichalcum.

00:02:28.897 --> 00:02:31.269
That crown already
belongs to you.

00:02:31.303 --> 00:02:33.807
And why should I stand
in the way of the Hero

00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:37.347
and his quest to bring peace
to all of the kingdoms?

00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:40.287
Your highness - thank you!

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.660
Soldier: A ship from
Bengarna is entering port!

00:02:54.214 --> 00:02:55.752
Very impressive.

00:02:55.785 --> 00:02:57.855
Not the most subtle, is it?

00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:17.060
Princess Leona.

00:03:17.094 --> 00:03:20.233
I've come, answering
your summons.

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:21.570
King Bengarna,

00:03:21.603 --> 00:03:24.677
we specifically asked you
to travel with discretion.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.247
A warship like this...

00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:29.419
King Romos: And what
are those weapons?

00:03:29.452 --> 00:03:31.523
King Bengarna:
They're tanks, King Romos.

00:03:31.556 --> 00:03:34.897
This elite force is
the gem of my country.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.533
Isn't that right, Akhim?

00:03:36.566 --> 00:03:39.706
Sir! Bengarna's Tank
Brigade takes pride in being

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.512
the strongest army of
all the human kingdoms.

00:03:42.545 --> 00:03:44.750
King Bengarna: It's all
about weapons, now.

00:03:44.783 --> 00:03:48.356
Swords and magic are
nothing against a cannon.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.528
This summit is
a war council on

00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:54.034
strategies against
the Dark Army, isn't it?

00:03:54.068 --> 00:03:56.540
So, where are the others?

00:03:58.744 --> 00:04:00.246
Please, follow me.

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:06.125
I suppose even leaders of men
can't always be admirable.

00:04:06.158 --> 00:04:10.134
Crocodine, I... I know this is
a bad time to ask, but we...

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:15.277
No need to worry.
I will defend Papnica.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.483
I s'pose it also has them, too.

00:04:19.185 --> 00:04:20.454
Okay, Popp.

00:04:20.487 --> 00:04:23.359
Hold it. Just let
me rest a little.

00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:33.146
Wow...

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.651
There she is;
Papnica Kingdom!

00:04:36.185 --> 00:04:37.622
This is so embarrassing.

00:04:37.655 --> 00:04:39.157
Our puny boat isn't going to

00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:40.962
make for a very
impressive arrival.

00:04:40.995 --> 00:04:44.102
I'm not gonna look anything
like a hero in this.

00:04:44.135 --> 00:04:45.470
Be quiet - and listen!

00:04:45.505 --> 00:04:48.276
We decided as a group to
change our criminal ways

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:51.617
and try to become a real
Hero's party, did we not?

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.818
Yeah, but...

00:04:52.852 --> 00:04:55.290
Papnica's putting up a good
fight against the Dark Army

00:04:55.323 --> 00:04:57.996
so this is our
opportunity to make it big!

00:04:58.029 --> 00:05:01.302
If we help them win we'll get
to be real heroes, won't we?

00:05:01.335 --> 00:05:03.941
All we need to do is
show up and fight a bit,

00:05:03.974 --> 00:05:07.281
get our name out there,
and maybe make a bit of money!

00:05:07.314 --> 00:05:09.819
Here we come, Papnica!

00:05:09.853 --> 00:05:13.392
All: Let's go, team!

00:05:18.737 --> 00:05:19.906
What's that?

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:21.108
[worried yells]

00:05:32.431 --> 00:05:35.270
Landing... cancelled?

00:05:35.303 --> 00:05:36.573
All: Yep, sounds great!

00:05:51.302 --> 00:05:53.139
So, what? Has he started yet?

00:05:53.908 --> 00:05:55.210
The same as before.

00:05:55.243 --> 00:05:56.947
He tossed the Crown
into the furnace and

00:05:56.981 --> 00:05:59.620
now he's just staring at
Dai's hand for some reason.

00:05:59.653 --> 00:06:02.190
That's it? It's been
half a day already.

00:06:02.223 --> 00:06:04.461
Who knows how
long this'll take.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.388
So, um, Lon Beruk, sir...

00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:20.762
Long ago, people and
their weapons were as one.

00:06:20.795 --> 00:06:24.869
Warriors trained relentlessly
to be worthy of their blade.

00:06:24.903 --> 00:06:29.111
And that weapon would need to be
equal with the wielder's skill.

00:06:29.145 --> 00:06:31.116
Now they're all worthless.

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:33.019
All except for you...

00:06:33.052 --> 00:06:36.493
I need you to show me what
it means to be worthy of

00:06:36.527 --> 00:06:39.732
wielding the most
powerful weapon created.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.536
I can try!

00:06:43.674 --> 00:06:47.481
Lon: Jank, give me a hand.
This is going to be a big job.

00:06:47.515 --> 00:06:49.051
It's about time.

00:06:55.531 --> 00:06:56.833
You hear that?

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.442
What's up?

00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:05.618
Lon has already started
forging like a madman.

00:07:05.651 --> 00:07:06.820
I'm going to help him.

00:07:06.854 --> 00:07:09.659
Know that it's best not
break his concentration.

00:07:09.693 --> 00:07:12.899
According to him, this sword is
going to be like a living thing

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:15.605
bound specifically to your
little friend in there.

00:07:15.638 --> 00:07:17.440
I can't imagine
it'll be anything like

00:07:17.474 --> 00:07:19.111
making an ordinary weapon.

00:07:19.145 --> 00:07:20.982
Oh, I get it. Interesting.

00:07:21.015 --> 00:07:23.119
That's why he was
spending so much time

00:07:23.153 --> 00:07:24.623
studying Dai's
hands in there.

00:07:24.656 --> 00:07:25.825
Don't they say that a

00:07:25.858 --> 00:07:28.329
"true weapon will
choose it's wielder"?

00:07:28.362 --> 00:07:29.465
That's right.

00:07:29.498 --> 00:07:32.237
You've got this,
then. Thanks dad.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.909
I don't need you
to tell me that, boy!

00:07:37.348 --> 00:07:39.051
Jank: What's wrong, miss?

00:07:39.753 --> 00:07:40.387
Merle?!

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.026
Merle: I see it... I see it!

00:07:43.059 --> 00:07:44.996
A giant shadow...

00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.831
[worried breaths]

00:07:45.864 --> 00:07:49.405
An awful...
Terrifying power...

00:07:49.438 --> 00:07:52.912
At this rate, Papnica...
will fall - soon!

00:08:03.967 --> 00:08:05.103
What's wrong?

00:08:05.136 --> 00:08:06.205
Nothing.

00:08:08.844 --> 00:08:10.915
King Romos: King
Bengarna, as we've said,

00:08:10.948 --> 00:08:13.219
we must gather the
world's forces as one

00:08:13.253 --> 00:08:16.894
if we want even a chance
of defeating the Dark Army.

00:08:16.927 --> 00:08:19.632
That is the reason
we've all gathered here.

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.904
And my army will
lead the charge.

00:08:21.937 --> 00:08:24.441
Now, everyone relax
and leave it to me.

00:08:24.475 --> 00:08:27.181
Your Majesty,
my country Ringaia,

00:08:27.214 --> 00:08:30.587
it was known as the great
"Fortress Kingdom."

00:08:30.621 --> 00:08:32.892
And yet our capital
was destroyed.

00:08:32.926 --> 00:08:36.332
Burnt to ground by the Dragon
Legion after only a week.

00:08:36.366 --> 00:08:38.036
Yes, I'm well aware.

00:08:38.069 --> 00:08:38.904
So you say.

00:08:38.937 --> 00:08:40.473
Their power needs
to be witnessed

00:08:40.508 --> 00:08:41.943
if you want to understand.

00:08:41.977 --> 00:08:44.816
So forgive me, King, but the day
that they come to your gates?

00:08:44.849 --> 00:08:46.920
You may wish for the
sake of your country

00:08:46.953 --> 00:08:51.028
that you had done more to stop
them before it got that far.

00:08:51.062 --> 00:08:53.466
King Bengarna: You
insult me, General Bowson.

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:55.504
Do you not understand
that my army is

00:08:55.538 --> 00:08:58.109
the greatest to
have ever existed?!

00:09:04.589 --> 00:09:06.359
Leona [thought]:
All the effort put into

00:09:06.392 --> 00:09:08.063
getting everyone here...

00:09:08.096 --> 00:09:09.866
This is going nowhere.

00:09:11.235 --> 00:09:15.712
Observe! My cutting edge,
top-class warship...

00:09:15.745 --> 00:09:18.784
My unstoppable Tank Brigade!

00:09:18.817 --> 00:09:23.192
No matter what forces the Dark
Army may have, they can't...

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.079
[frightened breaths]

00:09:33.112 --> 00:09:34.615
W-What is that thing?!

00:09:40.795 --> 00:09:44.367
Th-That's... impossible!

00:09:53.553 --> 00:09:55.456
What is that?!

00:09:55.489 --> 00:09:56.627
I do not know.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:00.166
I do not know,
but I do know one thing...

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.872
Papnica is finished!

00:10:03.874 --> 00:10:06.279
It's the mighty
Sovereign Rock Castle.

00:10:06.312 --> 00:10:08.884
Crocodine [thought]: So
Hyunckel's hypothesis was right.

00:10:08.918 --> 00:10:12.391
Sovereign Rock Castle itself
is a walking fortress...

00:10:12.424 --> 00:10:14.962
A giant Overfiend.

00:10:14.996 --> 00:10:18.837
Even then... It's larger
than I thought possible.

00:10:20.306 --> 00:10:21.209
This is bad!

00:10:21.242 --> 00:10:23.981
A giant... A giant's
attacking the city!

00:10:24.014 --> 00:10:24.916
Hold on.

00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:26.687
How did something
that size get so close

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.255
without anyone noticing?

00:10:28.289 --> 00:10:31.897
Well, there's a thick
mist covering the ocean.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:34.535
A mist? You said mist?!

00:10:34.569 --> 00:10:38.108
Could it be... Mystvearn?!

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.454
Mystvearn: Bengarna's ship...

00:10:44.488 --> 00:10:47.127
Just as Hadlar suspected.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.567
The world leaders are
gathered here in Papnica.

00:10:50.601 --> 00:10:53.707
Pathetic ants
who defy King Vearn.

00:10:53.741 --> 00:10:57.213
I'll smoke them out
and crush them.

00:11:05.565 --> 00:11:17.821
[terrified screams]

00:11:34.054 --> 00:11:36.325
W-What kind of titan is this?

00:11:36.358 --> 00:11:37.494
Astounding...

00:11:37.528 --> 00:11:39.865
It is beyond human
comprehension.

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:44.007
It is no coincidence that
they've chosen to attack today.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.911
They knew about this meeting.

00:11:49.384 --> 00:11:50.888
Akhim!

00:11:50.921 --> 00:11:53.092
Take command of
the Tank Brigade.

00:11:53.125 --> 00:11:56.866
The Army of Bengarna will
not be defeated so easily!

00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:00.273
Akhim: Yes, your
Majesty. Right away!

00:12:00.306 --> 00:12:03.045
King Bengarna, you
should not be reckless.

00:12:03.079 --> 00:12:06.553
It has already destroyed a
warship with a single attack.

00:12:06.586 --> 00:12:09.158
My tanks...
My tanks won't lose.

00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:13.332
They'll blow that lump of rock
to smithereens - you'll see!

00:12:13.366 --> 00:12:15.136
Follow me!

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:18.510
No, wait!

00:12:18.544 --> 00:12:20.915
Crocodine: That's not just
some creature made of rocks...

00:12:20.948 --> 00:12:22.852
It's the Sovereign Rock Castle.

00:12:22.885 --> 00:12:25.156
The main fortress
of the Dark Army.

00:12:25.189 --> 00:12:29.799
To face it head-on would
mean absolute destruction!

00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:31.235
I have my orders.

00:12:31.268 --> 00:12:34.208
Bengarna will prove
itself on the battlefield.

00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:37.214
Win or lose, we must
display the courage

00:12:37.247 --> 00:12:40.887
that may someday lead our
kingdoms to victory!

00:12:41.656 --> 00:12:42.925
Out of the way!

00:12:45.531 --> 00:12:48.603
Crocodine [thought]: While I did
not trust this man at first,

00:12:48.637 --> 00:12:51.408
he has proven to be
loyal to his king.

00:12:51.441 --> 00:12:55.417
I sense a warrior in him.
I cannot let him fail.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:56.786
Baduck: Crocodine!

00:12:58.355 --> 00:12:59.291
Crocodine: Baduck!

00:12:59.324 --> 00:13:02.664
Sorry for the wait.
It's finally complete.

00:13:02.698 --> 00:13:06.305
What perfect timing.
My Vortex Axe.

00:13:06.339 --> 00:13:09.679
The life of this weapon
is in its Magical Jewel.

00:13:09.712 --> 00:13:11.415
We're lucky it was undamaged...

00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:12.851
So I've rebuilt the blade-

00:13:12.885 --> 00:13:15.356
using only the best
Papnican Steel.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:19.532
I call it... the Vortex
Axe Returns Mark Two!

00:13:19.565 --> 00:13:23.306
This will give me... the
strength of a hundred soldiers.

00:13:23.339 --> 00:13:26.479
Baduck: No, the
strength of a thousand!

00:13:26.513 --> 00:13:28.315
You have my thanks, old man.

00:13:28.349 --> 00:13:32.490
Baduck: We're counting on you.
I will join you posthaste!

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:39.672
It's no good.

00:13:39.706 --> 00:13:41.777
I still can't
use the crystal ball

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:43.814
the way my Grandmother does.

00:13:43.847 --> 00:13:46.853
That was enough.
We just needed a glimpse.

00:13:46.886 --> 00:13:49.090
Something big is on its way.

00:13:51.963 --> 00:13:53.667
We need to go - immediately!

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:54.635
Hold it!

00:13:57.107 --> 00:13:58.676
Lon: Have you forgotten?

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:01.516
This sword is
being made for you.

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:05.290
It's being imbued with a
life force equal to yours.

00:14:05.323 --> 00:14:09.330
This is no ordinary
weapon... It has a soul!

00:14:10.466 --> 00:14:13.372
The sword will have...
its very own soul?

00:14:13.405 --> 00:14:16.646
When this blade reaches
out to your soul...

00:14:16.679 --> 00:14:19.920
When it sees you
as it's wielder...

00:14:19.953 --> 00:14:23.092
It'll unleash the
greatest power of all.

00:14:23.125 --> 00:14:25.062
That is why
you must stay here

00:14:25.095 --> 00:14:28.069
and bear witness
to it's creation!

00:14:28.102 --> 00:14:29.337
We're coming back.

00:14:29.371 --> 00:14:31.275
Don't you think you can keep
working in the meantime?

00:14:31.309 --> 00:14:36.252
A blade like this needs to hear
Dai's soul speak directly to it.

00:14:36.285 --> 00:14:38.656
And without that voice
calling out to it,

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.595
this becomes merely
another weapon,

00:14:40.628 --> 00:14:42.396
destined for mediocrity.

00:14:45.436 --> 00:14:48.543
Lon is pouring his
life into creating it.

00:14:48.577 --> 00:14:52.250
It must take godly strength
beyond our understanding

00:14:52.283 --> 00:14:55.389
to be able to make
a sword like this one.

00:14:55.423 --> 00:14:58.162
This is not a normal
forging process.

00:14:58.195 --> 00:15:00.800
It's difficult
to use orichalcum.

00:15:00.834 --> 00:15:03.372
But Papnica needs us-
you saw it.

00:15:04.675 --> 00:15:07.114
Okay, then. Dai,
you'll stay here.

00:15:07.147 --> 00:15:10.587
Wait here for your
sword to be finished.

00:15:10.621 --> 00:15:14.529
We'll hold off the Dark
Army for as long as we can.

00:15:14.562 --> 00:15:16.265
But, Popp, an enemy like that?

00:15:16.298 --> 00:15:19.204
We need to work together to
even have a chance at winning!

00:15:19.237 --> 00:15:22.310
Popp: And that's exactly
why you have to stay here.

00:15:23.145 --> 00:15:24.582
They must have known that all

00:15:24.616 --> 00:15:27.554
the human leaders were
going to be in the city.

00:15:27.588 --> 00:15:31.428
So, we need this Hero's Sword
now more than ever before!

00:15:31.461 --> 00:15:32.497
But, Popp...

00:15:32.531 --> 00:15:35.003
The way you're acting
you'd think the rest of us

00:15:35.036 --> 00:15:36.873
couldn't even buy
you a little time.

00:15:36.906 --> 00:15:38.208
After all we've been through,

00:15:38.242 --> 00:15:40.814
he should know better
than that, right, Maam?

00:15:40.847 --> 00:15:42.350
Leave it to us.

00:15:42.384 --> 00:15:43.285
Yes.

00:15:43.318 --> 00:15:44.555
[cocky chuckle]

00:15:44.588 --> 00:15:45.524
[happy chirp]

00:15:45.557 --> 00:15:46.592
You guys...

00:15:46.626 --> 00:15:48.630
Popp: So, that's the deal.

00:15:48.663 --> 00:15:50.634
We'll keep those monsters busy.

00:15:56.111 --> 00:15:57.548
Wait for my order!

00:15:59.284 --> 00:16:01.522
Mystvearn: Hopeless fools.

00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:06.566
And fire!

00:16:14.347 --> 00:16:16.284
Keep firing.

00:16:17.888 --> 00:16:19.390
Amazing!

00:16:21.161 --> 00:16:23.465
Weigh anchor and fire again.

00:16:23.499 --> 00:16:24.568
Aye!

00:16:35.423 --> 00:16:38.630
Popp [thought]: That was pretty
cool what I said back there.

00:16:38.663 --> 00:16:42.838
I guess I can't back down now
that I've said it, though...

00:16:42.872 --> 00:16:45.745
Whatever that thing
is looked huge!

00:16:45.778 --> 00:16:47.882
What am I even doing?!

00:16:47.915 --> 00:16:50.052
I'm an idiot.

00:16:50.821 --> 00:16:51.822
Chiu: It's official.

00:16:51.856 --> 00:16:53.927
That guy is freaking
out, Miss Maam.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.997
Are you really sure about him?

00:16:56.031 --> 00:16:57.066
Honestly.

00:16:57.099 --> 00:16:58.435
Maam: He's fine.

00:16:58.468 --> 00:17:00.974
Every time I start to think
Popp is about to lose it,

00:17:01.007 --> 00:17:03.479
he somehow gets
it under control.

00:17:03.513 --> 00:17:05.551
It's actually kind
of incredible.

00:17:05.584 --> 00:17:07.988
He's done this as long
as I've known him.

00:17:08.022 --> 00:17:09.123
Yes.

00:17:11.295 --> 00:17:14.936
No point chickening out.
Grab the bull by the horns.

00:17:14.969 --> 00:17:17.440
Okay. Time to get going.

00:17:17.474 --> 00:17:18.509
Right on!

00:17:19.845 --> 00:17:23.554
And Dad, don't forget to be
useful to Lon Beruk, alright?

00:17:23.587 --> 00:17:24.454
Can it!

00:17:24.488 --> 00:17:26.458
You better not get
in everybody's way,

00:17:26.491 --> 00:17:27.460
you little brat!

00:17:27.494 --> 00:17:29.699
Just show 'em
what you're made of.

00:17:29.732 --> 00:17:31.636
[awkward chuckle]

00:17:34.407 --> 00:17:35.644
I will.

00:17:35.678 --> 00:17:37.446
Hey, dad? Thank you.

00:17:43.392 --> 00:17:44.394
Now, Zoom!

00:17:49.772 --> 00:17:50.707
Stein: Honey...

00:17:51.542 --> 00:17:52.511
Stein, I...

00:17:52.545 --> 00:17:55.049
Our little Popp's gone
away again, hasn't he?

00:17:55.082 --> 00:17:56.418
Yeah.

00:17:56.451 --> 00:17:59.659
But I've... never seen that
kind of look in his eyes.

00:17:59.692 --> 00:18:01.762
So much passion behind them.

00:18:01.796 --> 00:18:05.436
He's gone into the world
and come back all grown up.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:08.276
When he was a kid, I was
always worried that he'd be

00:18:08.309 --> 00:18:11.181
a wimp, a quitter,
or something like that.

00:18:11.215 --> 00:18:13.386
I remember when he
ran away from home-

00:18:13.419 --> 00:18:17.393
we were so angry at that
Master Avan he went away with.

00:18:17.427 --> 00:18:19.497
Jank: We should thank him.

00:18:19.531 --> 00:18:23.438
He turned that little wimp
into a man, didn't he?

00:18:29.886 --> 00:18:32.423
See that? Do you see?!

00:18:32.456 --> 00:18:35.029
The power of Bengarna's Army!

00:18:35.062 --> 00:18:38.870
[prideful laugh]

00:18:45.216 --> 00:18:48.155
I'm telling you.
We can win this one.

00:18:50.326 --> 00:18:51.862
Leona: Everyone, get back!

00:18:55.302 --> 00:18:56.238
[pained groans]

00:18:56.272 --> 00:18:57.207
King Bengarna: What the...

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.576
Popp, Maam!

00:18:58.609 --> 00:19:00.614
Princess! We're here now-
where do you need us to go?

00:19:00.647 --> 00:19:03.085
Down in the bay. But
how did you even know?!

00:19:03.118 --> 00:19:04.187
Popp: Merle warned us,

00:19:04.221 --> 00:19:06.158
so we hurried back
as fast as we could.

00:19:06.191 --> 00:19:09.297
But where's Dai? I thought
you were all together?

00:19:09.331 --> 00:19:12.470
Popp: He's busy making
the world's strongest sword!

00:19:13.305 --> 00:19:15.243
It'll be ready any moment now.

00:19:15.276 --> 00:19:17.582
But until the sword is
actually finished...

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:20.419
we have no choice
but to hold them off.

00:19:20.453 --> 00:19:21.756
King Bengarna:
[patronizing laugh]

00:19:21.789 --> 00:19:24.361
You can forget your
"world's strongest sword."

00:19:24.394 --> 00:19:27.366
Who needs something
like that? Just look...

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:33.278
My Bengarna Tank Brigade will
soon blow that giant to pieces!

00:19:34.347 --> 00:19:36.485
They won't. It'll defeat them.

00:19:36.519 --> 00:19:39.224
W-What?! Don't be ridiculous.

00:19:39.258 --> 00:19:42.062
Can't you see that
it's breaking apart,

00:19:42.096 --> 00:19:44.969
dropping pieces
of rock everywhere?!

00:19:45.003 --> 00:19:46.404
But behind all that smoke,

00:19:46.438 --> 00:19:48.408
it's clear that
the monster's energy

00:19:48.442 --> 00:19:50.513
still hasn't waned at all.

00:19:50.547 --> 00:19:51.949
In fact...

00:19:51.983 --> 00:19:54.722
Hold your fire, now!

00:19:54.755 --> 00:19:56.090
Well, wait...

00:19:56.124 --> 00:19:58.228
Akhim: There should
be nothing left.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:09.551
Look out!

00:20:18.068 --> 00:20:20.405
Abandon ship!

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:30.359
Akhim: How?!

00:20:31.896 --> 00:20:34.568
[astonished groans]

00:20:43.587 --> 00:20:44.588
A castle.

00:20:54.374 --> 00:20:57.146
Mystvearn: [chuckling]

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.217
You fools.

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:03.626
You've spoiled your
own surprise, I see.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:07.934
Sovereign Rock
Castle's true form.

00:21:11.141 --> 00:21:14.280
Princess Leona of Papnica...

00:21:14.314 --> 00:21:18.255
And the rest of the
world leaders in attendance...

00:21:18.289 --> 00:21:22.330
I am Shadow Legion
Commander Mystvearn.

00:21:22.363 --> 00:21:26.739
I serve the great
Dark King Vearn.

00:21:26.772 --> 00:21:30.647
The Shadow Legion...
Mystvearn.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.452
It is him. He's
come here himself.

00:21:33.485 --> 00:21:36.191
Mystvearn: I have
one objective.

00:21:36.225 --> 00:21:37.995
Yeah - what's it gonna be?

00:21:38.028 --> 00:21:40.332
"Come put down your weapons
and beg for mercy,"

00:21:40.365 --> 00:21:42.604
or something
pathetic like that?

00:21:43.806 --> 00:21:45.075
Mystvearn: Perish!

00:21:47.179 --> 00:21:49.151
Mystvearn: You are
all worthless.

00:21:49.184 --> 00:21:52.658
Nothing more than
vermin to the Dark King.

00:21:52.691 --> 00:21:55.930
There will be no surrender.

00:21:55.964 --> 00:22:02.777
So. I will erase this kingdom,
then your entire species!

00:23:37.801 --> 00:23:40.139
Narrator: While Dai waits for
his sword to be completed,

00:23:40.172 --> 00:23:43.044
the Shadow Legion descends
from Sovereign Rock Castle.

00:23:43.078 --> 00:23:45.516
The rest of the party
tries to fend them off,

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:48.088
but the enemy's
forces are endless.

00:23:48.122 --> 00:23:50.526
Soon, Mystvearn
himself appears,

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.531
attacking with
his Dark Aura...

00:23:52.564 --> 00:23:55.302
And the showdown for
Papnica's fate begins.

00:23:55.336 --> 00:23:56.806
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:56.839 --> 00:23:59.311
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:23:59.344 --> 00:24:02.550
"Master of Darkness
Against His Pupil".
