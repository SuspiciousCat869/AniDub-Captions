WEBVTT

00:01:50.622 --> 00:01:54.428
[roaring]

00:01:56.934 --> 00:01:58.370
Larhart: [determined snarl]

00:01:58.403 --> 00:02:00.775
Mystvearn: [struggling grunt]

00:02:04.883 --> 00:02:06.452
Sizzle!

00:02:10.895 --> 00:02:13.332
[charging roar]

00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:20.548
What the...

00:02:38.717 --> 00:02:41.890
Any idea what that
was, Your Majesty?

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:48.538
Flora: It's stopped.

00:02:48.571 --> 00:02:50.207
That low rumble
coming from somewhere

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.378
deep within the palace -
it's gone quiet.

00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:54.984
Princess Leona's Kaglimmer
may have held it at bay,

00:02:55.017 --> 00:02:56.620
but it never came to a halt.

00:02:56.653 --> 00:02:59.559
At least... not
until this moment.

00:02:59.593 --> 00:03:01.029
Wait a minute.
Doesn't that mean...

00:03:01.062 --> 00:03:02.198
I bet it was Dai.

00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:03.333
They must have destroyed

00:03:03.366 --> 00:03:05.938
whatever it is that
powers Vearn Palace.

00:03:05.972 --> 00:03:11.517
[cheering]

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.221
The Hero's party saves
the day once again!

00:03:14.255 --> 00:03:15.992
We're not out of
the woods yet.

00:03:16.025 --> 00:03:19.064
It doesn't mean that they've
defeated the Dark King...

00:03:19.097 --> 00:03:20.935
But it does mean
that Vearn Palace

00:03:20.968 --> 00:03:24.174
has been rendered inoperable.

00:03:24.208 --> 00:03:26.345
It was the only weapon
that posed a threat...

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.986
And without that, the
Dark Army has no advantage.

00:03:38.805 --> 00:03:41.409
Lon Beruk: Well, considering it
hasn't fallen from the sky...

00:03:41.443 --> 00:03:43.614
It looks like this
fortress must actually be

00:03:43.648 --> 00:03:46.654
made out of some kind of
material that can float.

00:03:46.687 --> 00:03:48.022
So it would seem.

00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:51.028
Flora [thought]: In fact...

00:03:51.062 --> 00:03:52.498
Rather than dropping
to the ground,

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:55.203
it appears it's doing
just the opposite.

00:03:55.237 --> 00:03:59.112
Very slowly...
Little by little...

00:03:59.145 --> 00:04:00.681
It's rising.

00:04:20.922 --> 00:04:21.957
No way...

00:04:22.926 --> 00:04:25.798
You have two of those
Dragon Crests now?

00:04:28.036 --> 00:04:29.940
Dai: It's more
than that, Leona...

00:04:29.973 --> 00:04:31.342
He's alive.

00:04:34.215 --> 00:04:36.553
It's Dad. His spirit
fills my heart...

00:04:38.322 --> 00:04:39.325
and his power...

00:04:39.358 --> 00:04:41.663
all of it is right
here in my fist.

00:04:49.513 --> 00:04:52.451
Larhart and Master Avan
weren't the only ones...

00:04:52.484 --> 00:04:55.992
who overcame death itself
to help me get this far.

00:04:56.026 --> 00:04:58.196
Dad was here, too...

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.334
He's been with me
through every fight,

00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:01.970
just like he promised.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.545
Leona: Honestly, your
father turning into a Crest

00:05:05.578 --> 00:05:09.184
and living on in your heart
sounds a little far-fetched...

00:05:09.218 --> 00:05:12.257
But at this point,
anything's possible.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.795
You might be out of your mind,

00:05:13.828 --> 00:05:17.067
but it's nice to see
you smiling for a change.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.864
What on earth is that thing?

00:05:31.897 --> 00:05:32.832
Goroa?

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.105
He looks different, but...

00:05:36.138 --> 00:05:37.608
I'm pretty sure
that's the guy who

00:05:37.642 --> 00:05:39.345
looked after the
Dark Force Reactor.

00:05:39.378 --> 00:05:41.583
Leona: Sort of a klutz, huh?

00:05:41.617 --> 00:05:43.988
Dai: I don't think he's
used to being in this form.

00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:46.593
He said he was a Drumbler
and Vearn gave him power.

00:05:46.627 --> 00:05:49.766
This drum creature must be what
a normal Drumbler looks like.

00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:51.469
Do you really
believe that Vearn can

00:05:51.503 --> 00:05:53.841
transform such a clumsy
little monster...

00:05:53.874 --> 00:05:55.845
into a guard who
nearly overpowered you?

00:05:55.878 --> 00:05:58.583
If he could, it wouldn't
really surprise me.

00:05:58.617 --> 00:06:00.521
Master warned us
that his Magic Power

00:06:00.555 --> 00:06:02.592
was beyond understanding.

00:06:04.295 --> 00:06:05.731
Dai: Let's get moving.

00:06:07.001 --> 00:06:08.671
It doesn't look like we're too
far from the top of the tower.

00:06:08.704 --> 00:06:10.875
Leona: Yeah, but I'm not
sure how we're supposed to

00:06:10.908 --> 00:06:13.479
get to the top with
the stairs blown out.

00:06:38.263 --> 00:06:39.465
Weird. There's nothing here.

00:06:39.498 --> 00:06:41.001
Let's go higher.

00:06:42.706 --> 00:06:45.143
[roaring]

00:06:51.122 --> 00:06:51.924
Gotcha.

00:06:51.957 --> 00:06:53.426
Kafrizz!

00:06:56.366 --> 00:06:57.768
[roaring]

00:06:58.604 --> 00:07:00.440
Get some of this!

00:07:01.075 --> 00:07:02.778
Keep him distracted!

00:07:02.812 --> 00:07:04.147
[roaring]

00:07:17.307 --> 00:07:18.476
Well, great.

00:07:18.511 --> 00:07:20.681
All that for nothing.
This guy's unbelievable.

00:07:20.714 --> 00:07:22.752
I mean, he's been
fighting all day.

00:07:22.785 --> 00:07:25.156
First Lon Beruk,
then the three of us...

00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:26.492
At this point,

00:07:26.526 --> 00:07:28.797
any ordinary warrior would
be totally out of steam...

00:07:28.831 --> 00:07:30.333
Maam: And it's like
he doesn't even

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:31.670
need to catch his breath.

00:07:31.703 --> 00:07:33.741
Because he's no
ordinary warrior.

00:07:33.774 --> 00:07:35.845
There's something
supernatural at work.

00:07:35.878 --> 00:07:38.216
I've already hit him with
several mortal blows...

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:39.887
But take a look at this.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.422
Larhart: The only
thing that's suffered

00:07:41.455 --> 00:07:43.026
any lasting damage
is my weapon.

00:07:43.059 --> 00:07:45.665
I'll wager that he's
completely unscathed.

00:07:45.698 --> 00:07:47.501
Mystvearn: Exactly
right, Land Rider.

00:07:47.535 --> 00:07:48.970
I can't hit you
with my attacks,

00:07:49.004 --> 00:07:51.109
and you can't damage
me with yours.

00:07:51.142 --> 00:07:52.377
We're at a stalemate...

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:54.683
However, it's only
a matter of time

00:07:54.716 --> 00:07:56.318
before your stamina runs out.

00:07:56.352 --> 00:07:57.955
All I have to do is wait.

00:07:57.989 --> 00:07:59.492
Popp [thought]: That's
what he's been up to.

00:07:59.526 --> 00:08:01.596
If we let him keep
drawing out the fight...

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:02.765
Maam [thought]:
We'll get exhausted,

00:08:02.798 --> 00:08:04.636
and once we're too weak
to defend ourselves,

00:08:04.669 --> 00:08:05.938
Mystvearn will strike.

00:08:05.972 --> 00:08:08.042
Larhart [thought]: The only
way we win this is if

00:08:08.075 --> 00:08:10.681
we uncover the secret to
his invulnerability.

00:08:10.715 --> 00:08:14.288
Until then, not even my best
attacks will finish the job.

00:08:14.321 --> 00:08:15.691
So, how?

00:08:40.073 --> 00:08:42.144
Leona: This must be
what's left of the dome

00:08:42.177 --> 00:08:45.518
that was on top of
the Tower of Supremacy.

00:08:45.551 --> 00:08:47.588
If there was
anything above it,

00:08:47.621 --> 00:08:51.128
I guess it would've been
destroyed by your Doruora.

00:08:51.162 --> 00:08:52.999
That sure was something...

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:56.071
I've never seen such
a powerful spell.

00:08:57.308 --> 00:08:58.544
Maybe we got lucky.

00:08:58.577 --> 00:09:01.149
Do you think it could've
taken out King Vearn, too?

00:09:01.182 --> 00:09:02.217
I kinda doubt it.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.622
I mean, sure, he might've
taken a bit of damage.

00:09:04.656 --> 00:09:07.294
But he's way too strong
to have gone down so easily.

00:09:07.327 --> 00:09:08.964
Vearn: Yes, precisely.

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:14.007
Leona, watch out!

00:09:17.447 --> 00:09:18.249
Vearn.

00:09:18.282 --> 00:09:19.519
That's him, huh?

00:09:19.552 --> 00:09:20.888
Congratulations.

00:09:20.922 --> 00:09:23.660
You've made an impressive
mess of my castle.

00:09:23.694 --> 00:09:26.667
Now that I've witnessed
what you're capable of,

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.772
there's no reason
to continue dawdling.

00:09:30.975 --> 00:09:34.816
It's time to erase you
and your dear princess.

00:09:34.849 --> 00:09:36.720
Leona [thought]: This is
the Dark King Vearn?

00:09:36.753 --> 00:09:38.255
But he's so... withered.

00:09:38.289 --> 00:09:39.491
Get ready.

00:09:39.525 --> 00:09:42.030
Dai [thought]: Vearn's always
been so calm and collected,

00:09:42.064 --> 00:09:45.070
but now I can sense his
malice out in the open.

00:09:45.103 --> 00:09:46.071
He's not bluffing.

00:09:46.105 --> 00:09:48.877
He's about to come at us
with all of his power.

00:09:48.911 --> 00:09:51.950
[roaring]

00:09:52.619 --> 00:09:58.763
Vearn: [powerful howling]

00:10:01.302 --> 00:10:07.748
[roaring]

00:10:22.044 --> 00:10:23.714
Leona [thought]:
I don't believe it.

00:10:23.747 --> 00:10:25.918
Simply unleashing
his Magic Power

00:10:25.952 --> 00:10:28.222
generates that much force?

00:10:28.255 --> 00:10:30.761
Dai [thought]: He's even
stronger than we thought.

00:10:34.168 --> 00:10:37.374
Dai [thought]: That means last
time, he was barely even trying

00:10:37.407 --> 00:10:39.077
and he mopped
the floor with me.

00:10:39.111 --> 00:10:41.115
I don't even know
what I'm up against.

00:10:41.148 --> 00:10:44.154
I know I've got
two crests on my side,

00:10:44.187 --> 00:10:47.027
but even that might not be
enough to match him now.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:48.531
Uh, Dai?

00:10:48.564 --> 00:10:49.799
Oh, yes.

00:10:49.832 --> 00:10:53.005
I know exactly what you're
thinking, little Hero.

00:10:53.038 --> 00:10:55.778
"What chance do I stand
against such a mighty foe

00:10:55.811 --> 00:10:59.117
now that I wield the power
of two Dragon Crests?"

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.090
Twin Dragon Crests.

00:11:02.123 --> 00:11:05.463
Vearn: That is what
I've decided to call them.

00:11:05.497 --> 00:11:07.500
Oh, real creative...

00:11:07.535 --> 00:11:11.341
Vearn: When a Dragon Knight's
reign finally comes to an end,

00:11:11.375 --> 00:11:14.481
their crest is returned
to the Mother Dragon,

00:11:14.516 --> 00:11:19.124
then she passes it on to the new
life which resides within her.

00:11:19.158 --> 00:11:21.195
You see, what makes
a Dragon Knight

00:11:21.229 --> 00:11:23.600
so dangerous is not
the Crest itself,

00:11:23.633 --> 00:11:27.875
but the Combat Instincts which
they inherit along with it.

00:11:27.908 --> 00:11:30.046
The mark that
you bear contains

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.183
the accumulated knowledge
and skill of every

00:11:32.216 --> 00:11:34.188
Dragon Knight who
has ever fought

00:11:34.221 --> 00:11:36.626
in the centuries
since their inception.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.163
This collective experience

00:11:38.196 --> 00:11:41.168
is passed from
generation to generation.

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:43.674
In other words,
every Dragon Knight...

00:11:43.707 --> 00:11:46.178
is born with the
instincts for battle that

00:11:46.212 --> 00:11:49.117
their predecessor spent
a lifetime developing...

00:11:49.151 --> 00:11:51.990
It makes them
exquisite in combat.

00:11:52.024 --> 00:11:54.328
You are the son of Baran;

00:11:54.361 --> 00:11:57.769
a Dragon Knight outside
the normal lineage.

00:11:57.802 --> 00:12:00.307
You were born with
a Crest of your own...

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.779
And your strength is
certainly considerable...

00:12:02.812 --> 00:12:06.052
However, you never
inherited the skills.

00:12:06.085 --> 00:12:07.287
Only now...

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:11.328
it seems Baran's Crest has been
passed down to you properly.

00:12:11.361 --> 00:12:14.034
The might of the Twin Dragon
Crests has been unleashed,

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:18.276
and it has granted you
superior abilities in battle.

00:12:18.309 --> 00:12:20.346
And by combining your
innate strength...

00:12:20.379 --> 00:12:22.885
with the combat experience
of every Dragon Knight

00:12:22.919 --> 00:12:26.325
who came before you, an
all-new entity has emerged.

00:12:26.359 --> 00:12:27.695
The Super Knight...

00:12:27.728 --> 00:12:30.701
Greater than a mere
Dragon Knight, you see?

00:12:30.735 --> 00:12:32.204
Vearn: With this
power awakened,

00:12:32.237 --> 00:12:35.009
I can no longer predict
your abilities...

00:12:35.042 --> 00:12:39.017
Who knows? Perhaps you'll
even surpass the Dragonoid.

00:12:41.088 --> 00:12:44.261
I, the Dark King Vearn,
have no equal

00:12:44.294 --> 00:12:47.367
and nothing to fear in
the great Trio of Worlds.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.437
However, I've lived
long enough to know that

00:12:49.471 --> 00:12:52.979
the unpredictable can
never be underestimated.

00:12:53.012 --> 00:12:56.052
Vearn: Therefore, I'm
left with only one option:

00:12:56.085 --> 00:12:58.556
Your immediate annihilation.

00:13:10.312 --> 00:13:13.086
Vearn: Therefore, I'm left
with only one option:

00:13:13.119 --> 00:13:15.590
Your immediate annihilation.

00:13:20.867 --> 00:13:23.339
Dai: Leona, you'd better
stay back for this!

00:13:23.372 --> 00:13:24.307
Wait, but...

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.510
[amused laugh]

00:13:25.544 --> 00:13:29.285
I'd heed his warning if I
were you, Princess of Papnica.

00:13:29.318 --> 00:13:31.288
To approach here is
to court your doom.

00:13:31.321 --> 00:13:33.827
If it's any consolation,
there was no point.

00:13:33.861 --> 00:13:36.431
Nothing can be done
to stop this now.

00:13:42.545 --> 00:13:44.147
Vearn: What's the trouble?

00:13:44.181 --> 00:13:46.786
Are you not going
to fight back, Dai?

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.322
Dai [thought]:
He's really fast...

00:13:48.355 --> 00:13:51.696
And his impact's way stronger
than before, too. But...

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.700
Leona: Dai?
What... What's wrong?

00:13:53.734 --> 00:13:55.203
Why aren't you
doing anything?!

00:13:55.236 --> 00:13:56.639
Leona [thought]:
I get it...

00:13:56.673 --> 00:14:00.079
He must not be able to decide
how to make his first strike.

00:14:00.113 --> 00:14:03.219
The last time Dai faced him,
Vearn broke his sword.

00:14:03.252 --> 00:14:06.993
And his Doruora didn't have
any effect on him either.

00:14:08.195 --> 00:14:09.498
He must be freezing up because

00:14:09.532 --> 00:14:13.105
he can't get a handle on
how to approach the fight.

00:14:13.138 --> 00:14:14.809
Dai [thought]:
How do I take him?

00:14:14.842 --> 00:14:17.113
With my sword... With a spell?

00:14:17.146 --> 00:14:19.351
Don't tell me fear
has taken you.

00:14:19.384 --> 00:14:23.393
How disappointing, but
convenient for me nonetheless...

00:14:23.426 --> 00:14:24.929
Now it's time to perish!

00:14:24.962 --> 00:14:26.666
Dai [thought]:
How do I do this?!

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:27.835
Leona: Hey, Dai!

00:14:27.868 --> 00:14:29.872
Trust me, you don't
need to overthink it!

00:14:29.906 --> 00:14:32.477
Just beat the
snot out of him!

00:14:35.951 --> 00:14:38.021
[roaring]

00:14:43.399 --> 00:14:46.171
[roaring]

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.389
Yes! I got him.

00:14:56.592 --> 00:14:57.595
I made him fall.

00:14:57.628 --> 00:14:59.599
I can make the Dark King fall.

00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:00.834
Okay, then.

00:15:00.867 --> 00:15:03.105
I landed the first hit.
Let's land another!

00:15:03.138 --> 00:15:04.241
Dai [thought]: Leona's right.

00:15:04.274 --> 00:15:06.579
Overthinking is just
gonna hold me back.

00:15:06.612 --> 00:15:09.886
And I'll never beat him by
fighting normally, so...

00:15:09.919 --> 00:15:11.890
The only way is to
find an opening,

00:15:11.923 --> 00:15:14.094
and then hit him with
all of my power...

00:15:14.128 --> 00:15:16.364
until he's down for good.

00:15:17.167 --> 00:15:18.870
Dai [thought]:
Just like she said.

00:15:18.904 --> 00:15:21.275
She's kinda got a knack
for this, doesn't she?

00:15:21.308 --> 00:15:23.647
Thanks, Leona.
Not a bad piece of advice!

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.784
Dai: But, I mean it's not
very "Royal Highness-y"

00:15:25.817 --> 00:15:29.024
of you to tell me to beat
the snot out of somebody...

00:15:29.057 --> 00:15:30.827
Oh, please. Give me a break!

00:15:30.861 --> 00:15:32.632
You're only proving
me right, y'know.

00:15:32.665 --> 00:15:34.200
You need to loosen up!

00:15:45.256 --> 00:15:47.327
Vearn [thought]: I was
sure I had him there,

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.601
but once again Dai
defies my expectations.

00:15:50.634 --> 00:15:52.236
His tactics are too erratic...

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.076
There's no way to
anticipate his next move.

00:15:55.109 --> 00:15:56.178
I was correct.

00:15:56.212 --> 00:15:57.681
He may not be aware of it,

00:15:57.715 --> 00:16:00.386
but the centuries of Combat
Instincts he's inherited

00:16:00.419 --> 00:16:03.593
from the Dragon Knights
are beginning to lead him.

00:16:05.496 --> 00:16:06.566
Remember...

00:16:06.599 --> 00:16:07.735
I hear you.

00:16:07.768 --> 00:16:09.104
Don't think - attack.

00:16:09.137 --> 00:16:11.375
Now, here we go. I won't
hold anything back.

00:16:11.408 --> 00:16:13.947
I'll hit him
with my best moves.

00:16:13.981 --> 00:16:17.220
Come on. This is it!

00:16:24.034 --> 00:16:26.572
Let's start him out
with an Earth Slash.

00:16:26.606 --> 00:16:28.009
Foolish little brat.

00:16:28.042 --> 00:16:31.181
I can shatter your
blade like glass!

00:16:33.987 --> 00:16:35.524
Vearn [thought]:
It won't break?!

00:16:35.558 --> 00:16:36.726
Yeah, that's right.

00:16:48.617 --> 00:16:50.721
[roaring]

00:16:50.754 --> 00:16:52.256
Earth Slash!

00:16:53.627 --> 00:16:55.195
[growling]

00:16:58.603 --> 00:17:00.339
Leona [thought]:
Dai, this is amazing...

00:17:00.372 --> 00:17:03.178
You're evenly matched
with the Dark King!

00:17:04.414 --> 00:17:07.253
Dai [thought]: It's really
working. I can fight him.

00:17:07.287 --> 00:17:09.457
My Draconic Aura,
power, and speed...

00:17:09.491 --> 00:17:12.731
They all have more force than
they did with only one Crest.

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:15.937
It's almost like somebody
else is fighting through me...

00:17:15.971 --> 00:17:18.743
Vearn [thought]: I knew this was
the true extent of his powers.

00:17:18.776 --> 00:17:22.551
It's been obvious ever since
he unleashed his Doruora.

00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:25.657
As I understand it,
Dragon Knights can only cast

00:17:25.691 --> 00:17:29.230
a spell of that magnitude
when they take Dragonoid form.

00:17:29.263 --> 00:17:31.001
Otherwise, the
energy it produces

00:17:31.034 --> 00:17:34.241
would incinerate
them on the spot.

00:17:34.274 --> 00:17:36.378
Vearn [thought]: Only the
combined might of humans,

00:17:36.411 --> 00:17:40.419
Dragons and Darklings may
wield such devastating fury.

00:17:40.452 --> 00:17:42.390
It's a kind of
built-in safeguard

00:17:42.424 --> 00:17:44.628
to protect the conjurer...

00:17:44.662 --> 00:17:49.939
Only... Dai just used it while
remaining in human form...

00:17:49.972 --> 00:17:51.308
Which means his power must be

00:17:51.341 --> 00:17:53.513
equal to that of
the Dragonoids...

00:17:53.546 --> 00:17:55.316
Could it be?

00:17:55.984 --> 00:17:57.353
You impress me,

00:17:57.387 --> 00:18:00.059
but I'm more interested in
what's beneath the surface...

00:18:00.093 --> 00:18:02.264
And there's only
one way to find out

00:18:02.297 --> 00:18:04.033
what you're really made of.

00:18:04.067 --> 00:18:05.469
No, I know that stance...

00:18:05.503 --> 00:18:08.241
Calamitous Wall!

00:18:11.849 --> 00:18:14.087
Vearn [thought]: You've
exhausted all my patience.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.728
Unlike our last encounter,
I won't show you mercy.

00:18:17.761 --> 00:18:19.030
Dai [thought]: It's too fast.

00:18:19.064 --> 00:18:20.366
I'll never dodge it!

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.738
Now burn, you little pest!

00:18:26.144 --> 00:18:28.516
Dai [thought]:
Wait... This is Aura...

00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:30.754
Or it's something
a lot like Aura.

00:18:30.787 --> 00:18:33.994
Blasting upwards as
it's racing towards me...

00:18:34.027 --> 00:18:35.697
If I'm right...

00:18:46.853 --> 00:18:54.434
[roaring]

00:19:32.343 --> 00:19:33.980
Vearn [thought]: He passed
through it unharmed?

00:19:34.013 --> 00:19:38.221
How? The full force of a
Calamitous Wall is impenetrable.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.463
Mystvearn: Judging by
these shockwaves...

00:19:42.497 --> 00:19:45.637
it seems King Vearn has
engaged Dai in battle.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:49.277
Very well. I suppose
I should finish this.

00:19:50.012 --> 00:19:51.081
Okay...

00:19:51.115 --> 00:19:52.751
You'd better hurry
up and heal Larhart

00:19:52.785 --> 00:19:54.020
before he tires out, Maam.

00:19:54.054 --> 00:19:55.456
I hate to admit it,

00:19:55.489 --> 00:19:58.195
but he might be our best shot
at taking down this specter.

00:19:58.228 --> 00:19:59.330
I'll buy you the time.

00:19:59.363 --> 00:20:00.601
-P-Popp. Wait -
-No, don't!

00:20:00.634 --> 00:20:02.470
Mystvearn: You don't
learn, do you, Mage?

00:20:02.505 --> 00:20:05.543
You aren't strong enough
to hold me off on your own.

00:20:10.821 --> 00:20:11.956
Popp, no!

00:20:11.989 --> 00:20:13.258
[helpless gasp]

00:20:20.306 --> 00:20:21.842
Hym: You know,
that's the second time

00:20:21.876 --> 00:20:23.312
I've come to your rescue.

00:20:23.345 --> 00:20:25.282
What is it you really
do around here?

00:20:25.315 --> 00:20:26.117
Popp: Y-You?!

00:20:26.151 --> 00:20:27.554
Hyunckel: Don't be afraid.

00:20:30.426 --> 00:20:32.531
Hym overcame the
grip of death itself,

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:35.335
and now he's been
reborn as our ally.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.543
Hyunckel...

00:20:39.545 --> 00:20:41.715
Oh, what a relief.
You're all right!

00:20:42.751 --> 00:20:43.753
Sorry. I didn't know...

00:20:43.786 --> 00:20:46.125
No, it's okay.
Don't worry about me.

00:20:46.158 --> 00:20:47.761
Popp: Are you kidding?!

00:20:47.795 --> 00:20:49.130
You moron.

00:20:49.163 --> 00:20:51.301
All we've been doing is
worrying about you.

00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:52.571
I thought...

00:20:52.604 --> 00:20:55.543
I mean we all thought
for sure you were a goner!

00:20:56.546 --> 00:20:58.750
If you ever pull another
stunt like that...

00:20:58.783 --> 00:21:01.689
I'm gonna kick
your butt. You hear me?

00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:06.464
I hope you'll forgive me.

00:21:06.497 --> 00:21:08.268
But, no, I'm not
planning to fight

00:21:08.301 --> 00:21:09.972
like that again any time soon.

00:21:10.005 --> 00:21:13.311
Backup has arrived, and
our enemies are dwindling.

00:21:13.345 --> 00:21:15.449
I'm here to watch you win.

00:21:18.222 --> 00:21:19.892
Vearn [thought]: I can
hardly believe my eyes.

00:21:19.925 --> 00:21:22.764
Even if he withstood it
using his Draconic Aura...

00:21:22.798 --> 00:21:24.534
he still should have
taken a tremendous

00:21:24.568 --> 00:21:26.806
amount of damage
from the shockwave.

00:21:26.839 --> 00:21:27.908
But somehow...

00:21:27.942 --> 00:21:30.948
He managed to shield himself
by manipulating the flow

00:21:30.981 --> 00:21:34.589
of his Aura to mimic the
energy of my Calamitous Wall.

00:21:34.622 --> 00:21:36.391
That's what allowed
him to pass through

00:21:36.424 --> 00:21:39.330
the shockwave without
being affected.

00:21:39.999 --> 00:21:41.969
Now Dai stands alone.

00:21:42.003 --> 00:21:45.342
None of his fellow Disciples
of Avan have ever come close

00:21:45.376 --> 00:21:48.783
to demonstrating this
level of skill or ingenuity.

00:21:48.816 --> 00:21:50.620
I'm certain of it.

00:21:50.653 --> 00:21:53.926
The Combat Instincts passed
down through every generation

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.433
of Dragon Knight since
the time of the gods...

00:21:57.466 --> 00:22:01.107
They've truly begun
to take root within him.

00:23:37.132 --> 00:23:38.970
Narrator: With the
collective experience of eons

00:23:39.004 --> 00:23:40.874
of Dragon Knights
guiding his attacks,

00:23:40.908 --> 00:23:43.746
Dai gains the advantage
against the Dark King.
