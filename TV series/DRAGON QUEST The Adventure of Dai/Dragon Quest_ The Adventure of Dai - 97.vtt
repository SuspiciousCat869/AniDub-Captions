WEBVTT

00:01:52.893 --> 00:01:57.836
Dai and Popp: [roaring]

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.808
I told you, it's no use!

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.452
Get off of me!

00:02:08.022 --> 00:02:09.291
[pained grunt]

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:13.166
True Vearn [thought]:
Something isn't right...

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.505
Have these two completely
lost their minds?

00:02:15.538 --> 00:02:17.408
They don't have any
hope of winning this.

00:02:17.441 --> 00:02:19.779
Whatever they try,
it's too late.

00:02:19.813 --> 00:02:21.818
True Vearn [thought]:
Whether I live or die,

00:02:21.851 --> 00:02:23.353
the Cores will detonate.

00:02:23.387 --> 00:02:25.056
It's pointless to attack.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.594
Their bodies are broken...

00:02:26.627 --> 00:02:29.065
There's no way left for
them to stop this...

00:02:29.098 --> 00:02:30.635
And yet they persist.

00:02:30.668 --> 00:02:32.037
True Vearn [thought]:
Look at them...

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.209
They're mindless -
like the undead!

00:02:34.242 --> 00:02:35.578
It doesn't make sense...

00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:38.083
How are they able
to rise again?

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:39.520
Is it like Popp said?

00:02:39.553 --> 00:02:41.591
Are humans truly
creatures that possess

00:02:41.624 --> 00:02:43.928
an unfathomable drive
to stand and fight

00:02:43.961 --> 00:02:45.598
for their puny lives?

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:47.267
That's enough.

00:02:47.301 --> 00:02:48.937
Don't touch me,
you disgusting worm!

00:02:51.242 --> 00:02:52.478
True Vearn: Answer me...

00:02:52.512 --> 00:02:55.417
Why do you still persist
with these futile antics?

00:02:55.451 --> 00:02:58.691
Even if you defeat me,
the countdown's begun.

00:02:58.724 --> 00:03:02.364
Popp: Maybe not, but if you go
down, the barrier might too.

00:03:02.397 --> 00:03:03.734
Once that's gone,

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:05.971
we'll get out of here and
go freeze the other Pillars.

00:03:06.005 --> 00:03:07.976
I'd say it all works
out perfectly.

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:09.779
You got a problem with that?

00:03:13.521 --> 00:03:15.457
Begone!

00:03:34.897 --> 00:03:35.899
How did...

00:03:35.932 --> 00:03:36.967
That worked?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.171
I guess I finally got
the hang of your Phoenix.

00:03:39.204 --> 00:03:41.176
Oh, what?.
Don't act so surprised.

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.847
You've been using
that one way too much.

00:03:43.881 --> 00:03:45.552
You got outsmarted.

00:03:45.585 --> 00:03:49.058
Wow, that must make
me a genius or something.

00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:50.193
Dai: You're brilliant, Popp -

00:03:50.227 --> 00:03:52.297
but don't let it
go to your head.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.634
We're not done!

00:03:54.603 --> 00:03:55.905
True Vearn [thought]:
It's stuck?

00:03:59.044 --> 00:04:00.114
Dai [thought]:
My sword...

00:04:00.147 --> 00:04:01.550
Vearn can't pull it out!

00:04:01.583 --> 00:04:03.620
Is it doing that on purpose?

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.699
Dai [thought]: If Vearn heals
all three of his hearts,

00:04:09.733 --> 00:04:11.904
he'll be able to regenerate
his arm, and then he'll use

00:04:11.937 --> 00:04:13.907
the Demonic Guard of Heaven
and Earth again!

00:04:13.941 --> 00:04:15.912
My sword is stopping that.

00:04:15.945 --> 00:04:19.586
If this was hopeless,
Vearn wouldn't be so desperate!

00:04:20.621 --> 00:04:22.124
Nobody else has given up...

00:04:22.157 --> 00:04:24.161
Not my sword or my friends...

00:04:24.194 --> 00:04:25.397
So I won't either.

00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:27.234
I'm not giving up, Vearn.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:28.571
Never!

00:04:28.604 --> 00:04:31.008
Then say goodbye, you fool!

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.281
Popp: Dai!

00:04:37.221 --> 00:04:40.260
You have exhausted
my patience.

00:04:40.293 --> 00:04:43.567
I've been far too generous.
I realize that now.

00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:47.876
You humans are perhaps the most
intolerable obstacle I face...

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:50.982
More than all the other
creatures together.

00:04:51.015 --> 00:04:52.117
If you insist...

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.190
on clinging to such an
utterly preposterous dream...

00:04:55.224 --> 00:04:58.162
then I won't bother
drawing this out.

00:04:58.196 --> 00:04:59.465
True Vearn: I'll
ignore the countdown

00:04:59.498 --> 00:05:01.737
and hit the Pillar below
us with my Magic Power...

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.877
True Vearn: You'll watch
as your pathetic kingdoms burn!

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.582
This time, I'm going
to make you give up hope.

00:05:07.616 --> 00:05:10.320
I'll tear it out
of you myself!

00:05:11.355 --> 00:05:13.093
Crocodine: [frustrated roar]

00:05:13.126 --> 00:05:16.332
No, no! Move! Let me at him!

00:05:16.365 --> 00:05:18.136
Hyunckel: If only
we could do something...

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:19.539
Anything...

00:05:19.573 --> 00:05:21.375
Dai and Popp are fighting
so far beyond their limits...

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:22.979
Avan: What sort of
friends would we be

00:05:23.013 --> 00:05:25.216
if we didn't fight with
all our might as well?

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.725
Maam: We didn't come all this
way just to watch, did we?

00:05:28.758 --> 00:05:31.664
Leona: Please... I can't
take this anymore.

00:05:31.697 --> 00:05:33.834
Let us move! Please, gods...

00:05:33.868 --> 00:05:35.971
Let at least one
of us help them....

00:05:36.005 --> 00:05:38.109
I'm begging you. Please...

00:05:38.143 --> 00:05:41.750
Let us out of here!

00:05:48.096 --> 00:05:49.966
W-What? B-But, how...

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.368
H-How can this be -

00:05:52.972 --> 00:05:54.642
Th-The Eyes...

00:05:57.247 --> 00:05:58.851
It's impossible...

00:05:58.884 --> 00:06:00.754
It's impossible!

00:06:02.257 --> 00:06:05.029
All: [roaring]

00:06:08.303 --> 00:06:10.875
Dai: He's... He's scared.

00:06:10.908 --> 00:06:12.311
Vearn's actually scared!

00:06:12.344 --> 00:06:13.547
Popp: Of course he is, pal.

00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:16.152
It's a miracle.
He hates those.

00:06:16.185 --> 00:06:18.991
True Vearn:
A miracle?! Absurd!

00:06:19.024 --> 00:06:20.829
There's no such thing!

00:06:20.862 --> 00:06:23.132
There's got to be
a rational explanation.

00:06:23.166 --> 00:06:26.071
The Eyes simply couldn't
move of their own accord...

00:06:26.105 --> 00:06:28.878
True Vearn [thought]: Somewhere,
someone who wields great power

00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:33.253
must be controlling them and
trying to make a fool out of me!

00:06:33.286 --> 00:06:34.455
The only question is...

00:06:34.488 --> 00:06:36.593
Where are you hiding?

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:42.003
I suspected as much!

00:06:46.647 --> 00:06:48.082
O-Ow...

00:06:48.115 --> 00:06:50.020
Leona! You're -

00:06:50.053 --> 00:06:51.388
I-It worked.

00:06:51.422 --> 00:06:53.493
True Vearn: So this
was your doing.

00:06:53.527 --> 00:06:54.729
Bravo, Princess.

00:06:54.763 --> 00:06:58.202
I must admit, you
continue to impress.

00:06:58.235 --> 00:07:00.407
A royal title may
be superficial,

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.612
but to wield enough
Magic Power to control

00:07:02.646 --> 00:07:05.183
the Eyes is another
matter entirely...

00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:07.622
I will not
underestimate you again.

00:07:07.656 --> 00:07:08.957
Leona [thought]:
Wait a minute...

00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:09.926
Seriously?

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:12.230
There's no way I have
that kind of power.

00:07:12.264 --> 00:07:13.767
I didn't do this...

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.571
If... If there's
anybody who could

00:07:15.604 --> 00:07:19.612
make such a miracle
happen... Could it be?

00:07:23.787 --> 00:07:26.793
That... That's
the Tear of the Gods!

00:07:26.827 --> 00:07:27.428
Huh?

00:07:27.461 --> 00:07:28.730
Both: Huh?!

00:07:28.764 --> 00:07:31.268
I don't believe it. You had
such a powerful thing?

00:07:31.302 --> 00:07:32.605
Don't tell me
you've been carrying

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:35.009
that around with
you all along...

00:07:35.043 --> 00:07:36.145
Wh-Where did you...

00:07:36.178 --> 00:07:39.484
Where did you get that?
G-Give it here, this instant!

00:07:41.322 --> 00:07:42.658
Leona!

00:07:48.369 --> 00:07:49.573
Well, well...

00:07:49.606 --> 00:07:51.408
If it isn't the
bothersome little Slime

00:07:51.442 --> 00:07:53.446
who's been traveling
with your party.

00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:54.916
Dai: G-Gomechan?!

00:07:55.818 --> 00:07:57.121
True Vearn: This thing...

00:07:57.154 --> 00:07:58.022
Both: [worried gasps]

00:07:58.056 --> 00:08:00.227
This cursed, tiny thing...

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:01.964
Stop it!

00:08:01.997 --> 00:08:04.067
What's the matter
with you? Let him go!

00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:04.902
Yeah, that's right!

00:08:04.936 --> 00:08:06.472
You've really
lost it, Vearn -

00:08:06.507 --> 00:08:08.376
what's the mighty
Dark King losing his head

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.113
over a single
Slime for, huh?!

00:08:10.147 --> 00:08:12.818
You really don't know
what this is, do you?

00:08:12.852 --> 00:08:15.791
It may look like one,
but it isn't a Slime.

00:08:15.825 --> 00:08:19.398
No. As a matter of fact,
it's not even a monster.

00:08:19.431 --> 00:08:20.635
Huh?!

00:08:20.668 --> 00:08:24.208
True Vearn: What it
actually is... is an item.

00:08:24.241 --> 00:08:27.046
A living item, created by
the gods themselves.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.823
In the Underworld, it's known
as the "Tear of the Gods."

00:08:31.857 --> 00:08:35.463
It is said the gods bestowed it
with a bit of their own power,

00:08:35.497 --> 00:08:40.608
making it capable of granting
the wish of whoever holds it,

00:08:40.642 --> 00:08:41.844
Since its creation,

00:08:41.877 --> 00:08:43.547
it has threatened to
topple the balance between

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.952
the Trio of Worlds
time and again.

00:08:45.985 --> 00:08:48.489
For it allows the
powerless to suddenly wield

00:08:48.524 --> 00:08:51.663
forces beyond their
wildest dreams.

00:08:51.696 --> 00:08:52.799
You're lying!

00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:54.769
I know it. Gomechan's
been my friend

00:08:54.802 --> 00:08:56.807
for as long as I can remember.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.478
He's been by my side ever
since we we first met

00:08:59.512 --> 00:09:01.315
back on Dermline Island.

00:09:02.953 --> 00:09:04.856
We've been through
everything together!

00:09:04.889 --> 00:09:07.595
Make no mistake,
I'm telling you the truth.

00:09:07.628 --> 00:09:09.699
I don't know why
it's taken this form,

00:09:09.733 --> 00:09:11.803
but only the omnipotence
of the gods could break

00:09:11.836 --> 00:09:15.343
the Magic Power sealing your
friends into those jewels.

00:09:15.376 --> 00:09:17.515
I assure you,
this is no creature -

00:09:17.549 --> 00:09:19.619
it's the Tear of the Gods.

00:09:20.754 --> 00:09:23.225
Now it makes sense
why my supposedly

00:09:23.259 --> 00:09:26.967
invincible Dark Army was
driven back this far.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.673
The Dragon Knight
and the Tear together...

00:09:29.706 --> 00:09:32.344
Both "Legacies of
the Gods" that courted

00:09:32.377 --> 00:09:34.682
the Heavens themselves
in your favor.

00:09:34.715 --> 00:09:36.118
It was their miraculous power

00:09:36.151 --> 00:09:38.924
that got you through absolute
peril over and over...

00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:42.163
That's how you've survived,
after everything I've done.

00:09:42.196 --> 00:09:46.038
Leona: You're wrong. That's
not why we're still here.

00:09:46.072 --> 00:09:48.543
It might be true... that
Gomechan's strange power...

00:09:48.577 --> 00:09:51.983
has helped us more than a few
times, I won't argue with that.

00:09:52.017 --> 00:09:53.252
Except...

00:09:53.286 --> 00:09:56.125
we didn't rely on miracles as
though we were using an item.

00:09:56.159 --> 00:09:58.964
Every time he saved us,
it was something small.

00:09:58.998 --> 00:10:02.170
Sometimes, it was just
the smallest gesture.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:07.014
He may be an item, but I'm
certain that he has a soul.

00:10:07.047 --> 00:10:09.553
I believe it was
Gomechan who helped us!

00:10:09.586 --> 00:10:11.756
With that tiny body,
using all his might.

00:10:11.789 --> 00:10:13.493
Look, he's
completely drained...

00:10:13.527 --> 00:10:14.662
Put him down.

00:10:14.695 --> 00:10:16.667
Please, you know you
don't have to do this.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.470
He's not a threat!

00:10:18.504 --> 00:10:21.242
You don't have to
hurt him, Vearn. Please!

00:10:21.275 --> 00:10:22.410
I suppose you're right.

00:10:22.443 --> 00:10:23.748
The wishes it's granted so far

00:10:23.781 --> 00:10:26.052
have all certainly
been small in nature.

00:10:26.085 --> 00:10:27.989
An ordinary item
could do that much...

00:10:28.022 --> 00:10:30.026
and it is no
threat like this...

00:10:31.162 --> 00:10:32.096
True Vearn: However...

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:33.768
That's merely
because you haven't

00:10:33.801 --> 00:10:35.103
learned how to use it!

00:10:35.136 --> 00:10:37.040
And it will
recover soon enough.

00:10:37.073 --> 00:10:39.044
Now that you know
its true power...

00:10:39.078 --> 00:10:40.013
No, don't!

00:10:40.046 --> 00:10:41.816
True Vearn: I'm afraid
I have no choice...

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.956
I can't just leave it be!

00:10:58.651 --> 00:11:00.655
True Vearn [thought]:
Shatter, you vile thing.

00:11:00.688 --> 00:11:02.357
Like dust in the wind.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:05.531
The Tear of the Gods can't
be left in human hands -

00:11:05.564 --> 00:11:07.400
they don't deserve it!

00:11:07.434 --> 00:11:12.010
That's right! Not even a
single fragment can remain!

00:11:12.043 --> 00:11:15.082
Gomechan, no!

00:11:25.738 --> 00:11:28.175
It's Dermline Island!

00:11:41.068 --> 00:11:43.907
Dai: It's Dermline Island!

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:46.780
Gomechan: That's right
Dai. We're back.

00:11:46.813 --> 00:11:49.519
This is where it
all started.

00:11:49.553 --> 00:11:51.389
Where you and I first met.

00:11:51.422 --> 00:11:53.359
The island of our memories.

00:11:53.392 --> 00:11:54.596
Wait, Gomechan...

00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:56.567
You can talk?

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.970
So that means....
It was true, wasn't it?

00:11:59.004 --> 00:12:01.442
Popp said when he was traveling
between life and death...

00:12:01.475 --> 00:12:04.982
He heard your voice and
it guided him back to us.

00:12:05.618 --> 00:12:07.989
So, uh, where are we really?

00:12:08.022 --> 00:12:09.826
Gomechan: We're inside
your consciousness.

00:12:09.859 --> 00:12:12.665
Time moves differently here
than in the outside world.

00:12:12.699 --> 00:12:15.571
From our perspective,
it's stopped altogether.

00:12:15.604 --> 00:12:17.508
Dai: Whoa. No kidding?

00:12:17.542 --> 00:12:19.345
Say, ah, Gomechan...

00:12:19.378 --> 00:12:20.748
It's not true, is it?

00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:22.751
That you're an item
made by the gods?

00:12:22.785 --> 00:12:25.289
Vearn made that up, right?

00:12:25.323 --> 00:12:26.760
Gomechan: I'm sorry.

00:12:26.793 --> 00:12:29.765
It's true, I... I am
the Tear of the Gods.

00:12:30.768 --> 00:12:31.903
C'mon, there's...

00:12:31.936 --> 00:12:33.607
There's no way
you're some item.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.343
We've been friends
for so long...

00:12:38.082 --> 00:12:40.319
Ever since I was
really little.

00:12:40.353 --> 00:12:43.025
Why... Why didn't
you tell me sooner?

00:12:43.058 --> 00:12:45.429
I've always known there was
something different about me...

00:12:45.463 --> 00:12:48.503
but I only just learned
the truth for myself.

00:12:48.537 --> 00:12:49.773
The ancient tomes say that

00:12:49.806 --> 00:12:52.077
when the gods created
the Surface World,

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:56.485
they shed a single tear for
its weak, suffering creatures.

00:12:56.519 --> 00:13:00.828
From that tear came a living
item, imbued with their power.

00:13:00.861 --> 00:13:04.134
It's the only item of its
kind in the entire world,

00:13:04.167 --> 00:13:07.007
and will grant the wishes
of whoever takes hold of it.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.446
Now I know...
that's what I truly am.

00:13:10.479 --> 00:13:11.916
I... I'm sorry.

00:13:11.949 --> 00:13:13.720
N-No, it's okay.

00:13:13.753 --> 00:13:15.958
I'm just a little
surprised is all.

00:13:15.991 --> 00:13:18.864
Honestly, it doesn't really
matter what you are either way -

00:13:18.897 --> 00:13:20.132
it's who you are.

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:23.205
Item or not, you're one
of our closest friends.

00:13:23.239 --> 00:13:27.013
And you truly are the type
of person I thought you were.

00:13:27.046 --> 00:13:30.353
I'm glad I granted your
wish all those years ago.

00:13:30.386 --> 00:13:31.388
"Granted my wish?"

00:13:31.421 --> 00:13:32.457
What do you mean?

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.696
You probably don't remember.

00:13:34.729 --> 00:13:36.833
You were pretty young then.

00:13:36.866 --> 00:13:39.271
The reason the Tear
of the Gods has a soul

00:13:39.304 --> 00:13:43.379
is so it can recognize an evil
wish and refuse to grant it.

00:13:43.412 --> 00:13:46.184
After granting the last
wish of my previous form,

00:13:46.218 --> 00:13:48.690
I reincarnated
on Dermline Island.

00:13:48.724 --> 00:13:50.393
I believe it was
chosen by the fates

00:13:50.427 --> 00:13:53.767
because it's one of the
purest places in the world.

00:13:53.801 --> 00:13:56.907
Dai: Pure? An island
full of monsters?

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.442
O-Oh, I get it...

00:13:58.475 --> 00:14:02.184
Not every monster's bad, and not
every human's a good person.

00:14:02.217 --> 00:14:04.522
I suspect the rumors
of the Golden Metal Slime

00:14:04.556 --> 00:14:07.896
may be a misinterpretation
of the true legend

00:14:07.929 --> 00:14:09.431
of the Tear of the Gods.

00:14:09.465 --> 00:14:13.640
To avoid the greedy souls who
followed that distorted myth,

00:14:13.674 --> 00:14:15.811
I needed to go
somewhere remote...

00:14:15.845 --> 00:14:17.949
Far away from
human corruption...

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:19.819
And that's where I met you.

00:14:19.852 --> 00:14:21.321
But, I don't...

00:14:21.354 --> 00:14:24.662
Think back.
Think way back, Dai.

00:14:28.035 --> 00:14:30.172
That's it, try to remember.

00:14:32.744 --> 00:14:35.083
Long, long ago.

00:14:35.116 --> 00:14:40.560
It'll come to you. Keep going.
Even further back.

00:14:56.726 --> 00:14:58.061
Who's there?

00:15:03.873 --> 00:15:06.344
Don't be afraid,
I won't hurt you.

00:15:12.356 --> 00:15:14.027
See? It's safe.

00:15:20.974 --> 00:15:23.713
A Golden Slime.
Will you be my friend?

00:15:36.105 --> 00:15:38.275
Gomechan: There you go.
Do you see it now?

00:15:38.308 --> 00:15:40.647
In a way,
that's how I was born.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.088
Even then, I could tell
that your heart was pure.

00:15:44.121 --> 00:15:46.659
Your wish let me become me.

00:15:47.528 --> 00:15:48.897
Then you...

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:52.003
You mean that y-you...
You granted...

00:15:52.037 --> 00:15:54.976
You granted my wish
to be my friend.

00:15:55.009 --> 00:15:56.813
And that's why...

00:15:56.846 --> 00:15:59.117
you've always
stuck by my side?

00:15:59.652 --> 00:16:01.656
Dai: All this time...

00:16:01.689 --> 00:16:03.058
All this time...

00:16:03.092 --> 00:16:06.766
you've been granting
me that wish...

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:09.639
through everything
we've done....

00:16:09.672 --> 00:16:11.341
Oh, Gomechan...

00:16:16.318 --> 00:16:17.622
It's time...

00:16:17.655 --> 00:16:20.794
Now. We have to say goodbye.

00:16:20.827 --> 00:16:21.996
Gomechan, wait...

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:23.900
Gomechan: Don't worry.
Life moves in cycles.

00:16:23.934 --> 00:16:26.205
Soon I'll take
my next incarnation.

00:16:26.238 --> 00:16:29.477
Only, before I return, my power
will need to regenerate.

00:16:29.512 --> 00:16:32.183
It'll take as long as it
did to grant the wish...

00:16:32.217 --> 00:16:35.456
Which means it will be over
a decade until I'm back.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.728
And when I do arrive,
I'll be starting over.

00:16:37.761 --> 00:16:41.268
But my memories will carry
on in you and your friends.

00:16:41.302 --> 00:16:45.009
And, I... I won't
remember you or any of it.

00:16:45.042 --> 00:16:49.218
Th-That's my...
That's my one true regret.

00:16:49.251 --> 00:16:51.355
Gomechan... You don't...

00:16:51.388 --> 00:16:53.092
It's all right.

00:16:53.125 --> 00:16:55.631
Let me go. I was almost
out of power anyway.

00:16:55.664 --> 00:16:58.770
During this great adventure
with you and the others...

00:16:58.803 --> 00:17:02.578
I've been granting everybody's
wishes without realizing it.

00:17:02.611 --> 00:17:05.182
I guess I couldn't
keep doing that forever,

00:17:05.216 --> 00:17:06.986
even if I wanted to.

00:17:07.019 --> 00:17:09.190
That might be why
I got so small.

00:17:09.224 --> 00:17:12.665
But it's okay.
It was worth it.

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:14.869
We did some good together...

00:17:14.902 --> 00:17:17.942
And I truly... couldn't ask...

00:17:17.975 --> 00:17:20.681
for anything else.

00:17:20.714 --> 00:17:22.551
So, thank you, Dai...

00:17:27.327 --> 00:17:29.298
N-No! Don't go. Please...

00:17:29.331 --> 00:17:31.168
Please Gomechan. Please!

00:17:31.201 --> 00:17:33.272
Don't forget me. You can't!

00:17:34.007 --> 00:17:35.176
Gomechan: Lastly...

00:17:35.209 --> 00:17:36.913
My dear friend... for you...

00:17:36.947 --> 00:17:40.219
and everyone who holds a place
in that golden heart of yours...

00:17:40.252 --> 00:17:42.323
I'll try to use
the last of my power.

00:17:42.357 --> 00:17:45.697
Tell me. What would
you wish for?

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:48.836
What can I grant you
before I have to leave?

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.140
A-A wish?

00:17:50.173 --> 00:17:52.444
Well, I... I guess...

00:17:52.477 --> 00:17:55.483
What I'd wish for
the most right now...

00:17:55.517 --> 00:17:59.257
would be... for all
our hearts to unite.

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:02.999
If I... If I could unite
the hearts and minds of...

00:18:03.032 --> 00:18:06.071
every single person
in every kingdom...

00:18:06.104 --> 00:18:07.607
Unite the whole world?

00:18:07.641 --> 00:18:10.179
Not for long - only
a few seconds.

00:18:10.213 --> 00:18:12.150
Like when Merle
got a vision..

00:18:12.183 --> 00:18:14.254
If we could do
that on a bigger scale,

00:18:14.288 --> 00:18:15.389
we could warn everyone and

00:18:15.423 --> 00:18:17.293
tell them how
to freeze the Cores.

00:18:17.326 --> 00:18:19.230
And then, maybe...

00:18:19.263 --> 00:18:21.802
just maybe...

00:18:21.836 --> 00:18:23.305
I think it's worth a try.

00:18:23.338 --> 00:18:26.478
I'll give this
everything I've got...

00:18:26.512 --> 00:18:30.219
But if it doesn't work,
I hope you can forgive me.

00:18:30.252 --> 00:18:32.858
Here we go.
Wish me luck, Hero.

00:18:35.229 --> 00:18:37.602
Goodbye, Dai. I'll miss you.

00:18:37.635 --> 00:18:39.638
Dai: No wait - Gomechan!

00:18:39.672 --> 00:18:41.809
Not yet... Not now!

00:18:42.611 --> 00:18:46.251
Gomechan - no!

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.377
True Vearn: Yes, there's
nothing to do now but watch.

00:18:59.411 --> 00:19:02.217
The pillars will
detonate any moment.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:03.754
No miracles this time.

00:19:03.787 --> 00:19:06.760
No last-minute gambles.
No hidden powers.

00:19:06.793 --> 00:19:08.362
No hope.

00:19:11.434 --> 00:19:14.675
Deroline: Get up, Dai.
On your feet!

00:19:14.708 --> 00:19:16.445
Deroline: Your thoughts
have reached us.

00:19:16.478 --> 00:19:18.883
We can see you lying on
your belly up there.

00:19:18.917 --> 00:19:22.223
He might have to brave this
frostbitten wasteland,

00:19:22.257 --> 00:19:24.895
but there's a Hero
on his way to help!

00:19:24.928 --> 00:19:26.065
And that's me!

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:29.104
[chuckling]

00:19:29.137 --> 00:19:31.442
Dai [thought]: The wish...
It... It came true!

00:19:31.475 --> 00:19:33.312
We all heard your
voice at the same time!

00:19:33.345 --> 00:19:34.582
Everyone you know must have!

00:19:34.615 --> 00:19:36.653
By the way, do you see any
treasure in that palace?

00:19:36.686 --> 00:19:38.455
Because if you do,
we've got first dibs!

00:19:38.489 --> 00:19:41.529
Masopho was right - that
slime of yours was valuable!

00:19:41.562 --> 00:19:43.198
Told you we should've
captured him!

00:19:43.232 --> 00:19:44.535
We'd have made a fortune!

00:19:44.568 --> 00:19:48.208
Can it, all of you!
Saving the world pays, too!

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:50.881
Apollo: Can you hear me, Dai?

00:19:50.914 --> 00:19:51.949
Apollo: This is Apollo.

00:19:51.982 --> 00:19:54.788
I'm already freezing
the Pillar at Valge Island!

00:19:54.822 --> 00:19:56.358
Where should I head next?

00:19:56.391 --> 00:19:57.628
Marin: Marin here.

00:19:57.661 --> 00:19:59.999
I'm taking care of the
Pillar in Western Papnica.

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:01.502
We can stop this.
Don't give up!

00:20:01.535 --> 00:20:03.238
We just need a little longer.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:05.209
King Romos: Dai...

00:20:05.243 --> 00:20:07.313
We're all with you.

00:20:32.931 --> 00:20:36.405
I feel... the thoughts of
people around the world...

00:20:36.438 --> 00:20:38.275
I hear all of them...

00:20:38.309 --> 00:20:39.612
It's incredible....

00:20:39.645 --> 00:20:44.020
The whole world -
United as one!

00:20:47.928 --> 00:20:49.665
Popp: I hear them, too...

00:20:49.699 --> 00:20:50.667
Princess?

00:20:50.701 --> 00:20:53.573
I do! I can hear voices
from around the world!

00:20:53.606 --> 00:20:56.278
They're freezing all
the Pillars. We can do it!

00:20:56.311 --> 00:20:57.480
True Vearn: Nonsense!

00:20:57.515 --> 00:20:59.184
Your minds are obviously
playing tricks on you.

00:20:59.217 --> 00:21:00.019
Hey, Merle?

00:21:00.053 --> 00:21:01.321
You heard it too, right?!

00:21:01.355 --> 00:21:03.593
Tell me we aren't just
hearing things. Is it real?

00:21:03.626 --> 00:21:05.362
I heard it. It's real, Popp!

00:21:05.395 --> 00:21:07.033
Everyone else...

00:21:07.066 --> 00:21:10.473
Everyone else is saying
they can hear it, as well.

00:21:10.507 --> 00:21:13.947
All right... All right!

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:14.982
That's enough!

00:21:15.015 --> 00:21:17.453
You're rambling like fools.
You're losing it.

00:21:17.487 --> 00:21:20.325
Voices from all around
the world, promising rescue?

00:21:20.359 --> 00:21:22.964
You have clearly lost
your grip on reality.

00:21:24.133 --> 00:21:26.705
W-What... What is this light?!

00:21:27.908 --> 00:21:29.578
Dai: It's Gomechan.

00:21:29.611 --> 00:21:35.557
Right before his final moment,
he granted me one last wish.

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:37.226
To unite the world...

00:21:37.259 --> 00:21:41.067
To unite the hearts of every
person in every kingdom as one,

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.205
so we all could
stop you together.

00:21:43.239 --> 00:21:46.612
A miracle. They do exist.

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.203
Narrator: In a
daring final act,

00:23:39.236 --> 00:23:40.974
Gomechan granted Dai his wish,

00:23:41.008 --> 00:23:43.913
uniting the hearts and minds of
every person around the world.

00:23:43.946 --> 00:23:45.717
Now, without only
moments remaining,

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:48.488
Deroline, Apollo, and
the others race to freeze

00:23:48.523 --> 00:23:49.791
the remaining Black Cores.

00:23:49.825 --> 00:23:52.330
But as Vearn goes to trigger
the explosions himself,

00:23:52.363 --> 00:23:54.234
a brilliant light
envelops the continents.

00:23:54.267 --> 00:23:55.469
When the clocks run out,

00:23:55.504 --> 00:23:57.641
will miracles or
catastrophe prevail?

00:23:57.675 --> 00:23:59.912

Surface World, next time on
