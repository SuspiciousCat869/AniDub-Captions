WEBVTT

00:01:51.423 --> 00:01:53.661
Star Emperor Cross Slash!

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:28.864
Zaboera [thought]:
C-Crocodine.

00:02:33.406 --> 00:02:35.945
I thought I could slip away,
but you found me.

00:02:35.978 --> 00:02:39.184
I learned long ago never to
never take my eyes off of you.

00:02:39.218 --> 00:02:40.187
[cackling]

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.489
Ah, well observed.

00:02:41.524 --> 00:02:43.761
Except it was foolish of
you to come after me alone.

00:02:43.794 --> 00:02:46.900
Keep in mind, I could always
have another trick up my sleeve.

00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:48.336
Crocodine: No, you don't.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.044
If I know you, after losing so
badly and failing your master,

00:02:52.077 --> 00:02:54.382
you'd want to run as
far away as possible.

00:02:54.415 --> 00:02:56.319
The fact that you're
still crawling around here

00:02:56.352 --> 00:02:57.756
is all the proof I need

00:02:57.789 --> 00:03:00.828
to know that you've already
played every card in your hand.

00:03:00.861 --> 00:03:03.600
Lon Beruk's attack drained
you of your Magic Power.

00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:05.571
You barely made
it out at all...

00:03:05.604 --> 00:03:08.443
And you don't have any
items to restore yourself.

00:03:08.476 --> 00:03:12.017
That means you're
entirely out of options.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.956
Zaboera [thought]: Curse you,
you blasted crocodile.

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.094
When exactly did
you grow a brain?!

00:03:17.127 --> 00:03:20.266
I have to do something.
There must be a way.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.705
Without weapons, it will
have to be a battle of wits,

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.244
and I can't lose
to this blockhead...

00:03:25.277 --> 00:03:27.048
He's nothing but a rube!

00:03:27.081 --> 00:03:28.551
Perhaps that's my answer...

00:03:28.584 --> 00:03:32.124
Yes, that will be
my advantage...

00:03:32.157 --> 00:03:33.260
Zaboera: [frustrated snarl]

00:03:33.293 --> 00:03:37.000
Now, Zaboera...
prepare to meet your end.

00:03:42.111 --> 00:03:43.547
Please, have mercy.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.949
Zaboera: You're
right, of course.

00:03:44.983 --> 00:03:48.022
With my power depleted, I'm
out of options, as you say.

00:03:48.056 --> 00:03:50.795
I have no other choice than
to perish by your hands

00:03:50.828 --> 00:03:52.899
if you think that
is what I deserve.

00:03:52.933 --> 00:03:54.402
Considering all my deeds,

00:03:54.435 --> 00:03:57.809
yearning for such
retribution is only natural.

00:03:57.843 --> 00:04:00.749
But I did those things
because I was afraid!

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:02.552
Compared to the other
Legion Commanders,

00:04:02.586 --> 00:04:06.025
I was always the weakest...
I was threatened, even!

00:04:06.058 --> 00:04:07.895
Try to understand,
amongst them,

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:11.904
the only hope I had of survival
was to rely on my cunning.

00:04:11.937 --> 00:04:12.905
I understand.

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:15.343
With the defeat of my
Superior Being Zombie,

00:04:15.376 --> 00:04:16.514
I've learned.

00:04:16.547 --> 00:04:19.151
I've realized that
it's nearly impossible

00:04:19.184 --> 00:04:21.356
to survive without
relying on others.

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.828
Now that I know that, perhaps
I'll even turn a corner.

00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:28.003
I beg you, old friend.
Please, spare me - please!

00:04:28.036 --> 00:04:30.842
Zaboera: I swear... I'll turn
away from the Dark Army.

00:04:30.875 --> 00:04:32.010
You have to believe me.

00:04:32.044 --> 00:04:34.248
You're the only
one I can go to.

00:04:34.281 --> 00:04:36.586
After my failure, the Dark
King will have my head,

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.993
and your human comrades
will never accept me.

00:04:40.027 --> 00:04:41.462
Spare me!

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:49.613
Zaboera [thought]: That's it,
you naive twit.

00:04:49.646 --> 00:04:52.017
I knew I could appeal
to your sentiment.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.854
Now just put down that axe.

00:04:56.727 --> 00:05:00.300
While it may be true I have no
Magic Power or stamina left,

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:02.404
I still have
plenty of options.

00:05:02.438 --> 00:05:05.077
There hundreds of toxins
flowing through my veins...

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.412
And I've just mixed a poison

00:05:06.445 --> 00:05:08.550
that will turn you
into my puppet.

00:05:08.584 --> 00:05:10.721
I'll use you to
take out the others.

00:05:10.755 --> 00:05:14.328
All I need is a scratch,
then victory is mine.

00:05:14.361 --> 00:05:18.770
Do it, you lumbering
oaf - take the bait!

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:20.908
[whimpering]

00:05:20.942 --> 00:05:24.115
Crocodine: All right, then,
Zaboera. In that case...

00:05:24.148 --> 00:05:25.483
Come along.

00:05:26.587 --> 00:05:29.058
Zaboera [thought]: Perfect!
Exactly as I suspected,

00:05:29.091 --> 00:05:30.695
you're still a dull creature,

00:05:30.728 --> 00:05:33.266
after all - more
tooth than brain.

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:34.703
Although, you are
a stepping stone

00:05:34.736 --> 00:05:36.406
on my way towards my new life.

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:38.342
Credit where it's due.

00:05:39.211 --> 00:05:40.013
Gotcha!

00:05:41.917 --> 00:05:44.054
Zaboera [thought]:
Why would he drop his axe?

00:05:49.164 --> 00:05:50.501
You bastard!

00:05:50.534 --> 00:05:53.005
You were putting on
an act the whole time?

00:05:54.475 --> 00:05:56.445
Zaboera: Wait -
let's talk about this!

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:58.851
Zaboera... I may not
be the smartest,

00:05:58.885 --> 00:06:01.188
but if there's one thing
I've managed to learn

00:06:01.222 --> 00:06:04.027
from all of your
tricks... it's this:

00:06:04.061 --> 00:06:06.900
In our world, there are some
people who are simply beyond

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:09.272
any hope of saving,
and you're one of them.

00:06:09.305 --> 00:06:12.143
No. Wait a minute!
You can't... Crocod -

00:06:14.248 --> 00:06:18.122
[overwhelmed howl]

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.864
There you are!

00:06:21.897 --> 00:06:23.165
Baduck: Crocodine!

00:06:25.003 --> 00:06:27.875
So you finally defeated
this old gremlin for good?

00:06:27.908 --> 00:06:29.144
What a relief!

00:06:29.178 --> 00:06:32.251
Everybody's been turning over
the battlefield looking for him

00:06:32.284 --> 00:06:34.889
since we realized
he'd escaped the zombie.

00:06:34.923 --> 00:06:38.229
Good for you! You might
even get knighted for this.

00:06:38.262 --> 00:06:40.701
Baduck: [laughing]

00:06:42.104 --> 00:06:43.574
What's the matter?

00:06:43.608 --> 00:06:45.210
You see, old man...

00:06:45.243 --> 00:06:46.479
Before I joined your ranks,

00:06:46.513 --> 00:06:48.884
back when there were six
of us Legion Commanders -

00:06:48.918 --> 00:06:52.592
Zaboera's fearsome Magic Power
made him a respected individual.

00:06:52.625 --> 00:06:54.963
But blinded by
his own ambitions,

00:06:54.997 --> 00:06:57.434
he regarded others as
little more than tools

00:06:57.467 --> 00:06:58.738
to do his bidding,

00:06:58.771 --> 00:07:02.311
and so he became the
parasite we see before us.

00:07:02.344 --> 00:07:04.448
If only he were more like Dai,

00:07:04.481 --> 00:07:06.351
if he possessed
even a shred of desire

00:07:06.385 --> 00:07:08.456
to grow through his
own strength...

00:07:08.489 --> 00:07:10.326
He could've been a great man.

00:07:10.359 --> 00:07:13.399
Greed is truly a
nefarious disease.

00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:14.434
But who am I?

00:07:14.468 --> 00:07:16.339
If I wasn't the
first to fight Dai,

00:07:16.372 --> 00:07:18.042
would I have
been any different?

00:07:18.075 --> 00:07:21.349
At any rate, Zaboera never
had a chance at redemption,

00:07:21.382 --> 00:07:23.486
and so I pity him.

00:07:24.922 --> 00:07:28.196
If anybody's the great man,
it's you, my friend.

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:29.532
This one was nothing like you.

00:07:29.566 --> 00:07:31.368
No matter which
side you picked.

00:07:31.402 --> 00:07:32.939
Even if the
"Beast King" Crocodine

00:07:32.972 --> 00:07:37.481
had remained our enemy - he'd
still be worth our respect.

00:07:37.515 --> 00:07:39.986
He'd have risked his
life to better himself,

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.458
even if the reasons
he had were wrong.

00:07:42.491 --> 00:07:44.963
That's what I believe.

00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:46.198
Old man...

00:07:47.168 --> 00:07:49.639
You have my thanks.

00:07:49.673 --> 00:07:52.912
Baduck: Come on. Let's go see
how the others are doing.

00:08:01.428 --> 00:08:03.099
He's almost as
tough as a dragon.

00:08:03.133 --> 00:08:05.638
Monster: He's too strong.
We can't take him!

00:08:05.671 --> 00:08:08.510
Monster: Even if we
have him outnumbered...

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.852
Enough of your whining.
I say we all rush him!

00:08:12.886 --> 00:08:15.423
Hym: Give it up. It won't
make a difference.

00:08:15.457 --> 00:08:18.530
Oh, yeah? How about
a demonstration?

00:08:21.002 --> 00:08:23.841
Get out of the way.
This one is mine.

00:08:23.874 --> 00:08:25.945
So unless you want
your final moments to be

00:08:25.978 --> 00:08:28.951
embarrassing ones, I suggest
you leave him to me.

00:08:28.984 --> 00:08:32.525
You see, he's my prey.
Nobody else can have him.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:33.661
Hyunckel [thought]: Hym?!

00:08:33.694 --> 00:08:35.764
Is something wrong, Hyunckel?

00:08:35.798 --> 00:08:39.004
You look like an animal
caught in a hunter's sights.

00:08:39.037 --> 00:08:40.808
And here I thought
seeing my face

00:08:40.841 --> 00:08:42.444
wouldn't make
you feel anything.

00:08:42.478 --> 00:08:43.914
I guess you recognize me.

00:08:43.948 --> 00:08:46.854
Oh, I recognize you, Hym -
but I still don't understand.

00:08:46.887 --> 00:08:50.293
Hadlar created the Royal Guard
using Forbidden Magic,

00:08:50.327 --> 00:08:53.534
he conjured you and your allies
from pieces of Orichalcum.

00:08:53.567 --> 00:08:54.669
And now that he's gone,

00:08:54.702 --> 00:08:57.207
the flow of his
Magic Power has ceased.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.877
In other words,
without him,

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.516
you go back to being
nothing but an object.

00:09:01.549 --> 00:09:03.385
So start explaining yourself.

00:09:03.419 --> 00:09:06.726
To be honest,
I couldn't tell you.

00:09:06.759 --> 00:09:10.199
Hym: After you defeated me,
I fell from Vearn Palace.

00:09:10.233 --> 00:09:11.803
With nothing to
slow my descent,

00:09:11.837 --> 00:09:15.042
the impact alone should
have finished me off.

00:09:15.978 --> 00:09:18.717
I sensed my consciousness
slipping away,

00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:21.890
fading like an
ember in the night.

00:09:21.924 --> 00:09:23.928
Then, I felt myself
leave my body,

00:09:23.961 --> 00:09:26.934
and I was in another
place... full of darkness.

00:09:26.967 --> 00:09:30.474
Hym: And then... a sound
pierced through that darkness,

00:09:30.508 --> 00:09:33.614
shaking me to the
very core of my being.

00:09:33.647 --> 00:09:35.183
They were cries of defeat...

00:09:35.216 --> 00:09:37.722
Coming from Lord Hadlar
and the Royal Guard

00:09:37.755 --> 00:09:39.893
as the final
battle took them.

00:09:39.926 --> 00:09:42.363
I knew at once that
my friends were dead...

00:09:42.397 --> 00:09:44.669
That Lord Hadlar
was dead with them.

00:09:44.703 --> 00:09:48.075
The fight was over.
We had all lost.

00:09:49.244 --> 00:09:51.382
Then came a fire
in my heart.

00:09:51.415 --> 00:09:53.385
I couldn't let
the darkness take me.

00:09:53.419 --> 00:09:55.156
Even if I was
the only one left...

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:59.097
I had to live on and carry out
the will of my fallen comrades.

00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:02.270
I had to find a way back
to my body and avenge them.

00:10:02.304 --> 00:10:05.177
I had to take down at
least one of you disciples,

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:08.817
or their sacrifice
would have been in vain.

00:10:09.452 --> 00:10:12.625
[roaring]

00:10:15.664 --> 00:10:17.735
And here I am.

00:10:17.769 --> 00:10:19.939
When I woke up I
felt even stronger,

00:10:19.972 --> 00:10:21.843
and the hole in
my chest was gone.

00:10:21.877 --> 00:10:23.012
Hyunckel [thought]:
It's a miracle...

00:10:23.045 --> 00:10:25.283
The kind of miracle
that can only be caused

00:10:25.316 --> 00:10:26.686
by an undying spirit.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.189
If he's no longer a puppet

00:10:28.222 --> 00:10:30.493
controlled by
Hadlar's Magic Power;

00:10:30.527 --> 00:10:32.397
he's found a
will of his own.

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:34.000
Could it be...

00:10:35.203 --> 00:10:37.374
For a minute there
you had me worried.

00:10:37.408 --> 00:10:38.710
Guess I shouldn't be, huh?

00:10:38.744 --> 00:10:39.912
Making a new trident

00:10:39.946 --> 00:10:42.518
outta Hadlar's little
slave will be a riot.

00:10:42.551 --> 00:10:43.920
Does this
hand-me-down henchman

00:10:43.954 --> 00:10:45.991
actually think he
can take our place?

00:10:46.024 --> 00:10:48.262
Besides, Hadlar was a coward.

00:10:48.295 --> 00:10:49.398
When we're done,

00:10:49.431 --> 00:10:51.770
you'll wish you let the
Disciples of Avan take you down.

00:10:51.803 --> 00:10:55.042
Say goodbye. It's your
bedtime, junior!

00:10:57.447 --> 00:10:58.984
Hym: That was unwise.

00:10:59.017 --> 00:11:00.888
If you'd simply
stayed out of my way,

00:11:00.921 --> 00:11:03.092
I would have let you leave.

00:11:03.125 --> 00:11:04.763
Only now,
you've crossed a line,

00:11:04.796 --> 00:11:07.033
and I'm afraid you'll
have to be punished.

00:11:07.968 --> 00:11:10.206
Interfering with
me is one thing...

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.945
But to hear a pack
of overfed livestock

00:11:12.979 --> 00:11:15.951
speak ill of Lord Hadlar,
that's another...

00:11:15.984 --> 00:11:19.457
I'll make you all
pay dearly for it!

00:11:26.372 --> 00:11:35.289
[snarling]

00:11:48.483 --> 00:11:51.021
Wh... S-Silver hair?

00:11:51.055 --> 00:11:54.962
Hyunckel [thought]: He... He
almost looks like... Hadlar!

00:12:01.108 --> 00:12:02.410
[charging roars]

00:12:03.212 --> 00:12:05.082
[roaring]

00:12:47.835 --> 00:12:52.911
[roaring]

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.963
Hyunckel [thought]:
Th-This is...

00:13:20.568 --> 00:13:22.070
Why do I have this?

00:13:22.103 --> 00:13:24.642
It looks... familiar...

00:13:24.676 --> 00:13:27.948
Is this a gift from
my former master?

00:13:28.517 --> 00:13:29.652
Hadlar: You know, Hym...

00:13:29.685 --> 00:13:34.327
Of all my creations, I think
you resemble me the most.

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:39.404
Hyunckel [thought]: It's as if
Hadlar's been reincarnated...

00:13:39.437 --> 00:13:42.645
And that energy he just let
off was definitely Aura -

00:13:42.678 --> 00:13:43.814
no mistaking it.

00:13:43.847 --> 00:13:46.252
But how? Aura is life energy.

00:13:46.285 --> 00:13:48.824
A doll given sentience
with magic like Hym

00:13:48.857 --> 00:13:50.393
shouldn't be able to use it.

00:13:50.426 --> 00:13:53.801
That means... He's become
an actual life form,

00:13:53.834 --> 00:13:56.238
complete with an
individual soul and will.

00:13:56.272 --> 00:13:59.779
Perhaps Hadlar's essence fused
with him in the afterlife.

00:13:59.813 --> 00:14:03.052
Either way, this time
he's an all-new enemy.

00:14:03.085 --> 00:14:04.855
Air attacks won't
work anymore.

00:14:04.889 --> 00:14:07.528
Not to mention, if his
attacks are channeling Aura

00:14:07.562 --> 00:14:10.768
through his Orichalcum body,
he'll hit even harder.

00:14:10.801 --> 00:14:11.769
If I'm right,

00:14:11.803 --> 00:14:12.906
I should expect something

00:14:12.939 --> 00:14:15.510
at least as powerful
as Dai's Aura Blade.

00:14:16.045 --> 00:14:17.648
Hym: That's better.

00:14:17.681 --> 00:14:20.253
It's just the two of us.
So let us begin.

00:14:20.286 --> 00:14:21.388
Although, just looking at you,

00:14:21.421 --> 00:14:23.793
it seems as if
you can barely stand.

00:14:23.827 --> 00:14:25.598
You must be drained.

00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:26.799
You just fought more enemies

00:14:26.833 --> 00:14:29.304
than an average warrior
sees in their lifetime.

00:14:29.337 --> 00:14:32.276
All the same, I won't
be holding back.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:34.916
You're just an obstacle
that must be overcome.

00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:36.786
I can't afford
you any sympathy.

00:14:36.819 --> 00:14:38.256
You're too great of a threat.

00:14:38.289 --> 00:14:40.594
I could sense it
when we first fought.

00:14:40.628 --> 00:14:44.067
Just as Lord Hadlar gave
everything to defeat Dai...

00:14:44.101 --> 00:14:47.742
I too will give whatever
it takes to best my foe.

00:14:47.775 --> 00:14:50.212
And that foe
is you, Hyunckel.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:53.654
Now take this.

00:14:53.687 --> 00:14:57.260
Call it a gift - from me and
all of the Royal Guard to you.

00:14:57.293 --> 00:14:59.665
Every shred of our
honor and vengeance...

00:14:59.699 --> 00:15:02.270
combined in a single fist!

00:15:21.943 --> 00:15:23.179
Thank you.

00:15:23.212 --> 00:15:25.483
You've done well, Garuda.
Try to get some rest.

00:15:26.686 --> 00:15:27.989
Flora: The battle is ours.

00:15:28.022 --> 00:15:31.028
We've defended this Magic
Circle and keep it alight.

00:15:31.061 --> 00:15:33.834
It's all thanks to
your valiant efforts.

00:15:33.867 --> 00:15:37.273
We effectively have a bridge
between here and Vearn Palace.

00:15:37.306 --> 00:15:39.477
We can send up
help at any time.

00:15:39.512 --> 00:15:41.582
And if anyone in Dai's
party winds up injured,

00:15:41.616 --> 00:15:44.756
we can bring them back
here to heal them in safety.

00:15:44.789 --> 00:15:46.224
Crocodine: Because
of Leona's spell,

00:15:46.258 --> 00:15:49.097
Vearn Palace no longer
has its protective barrier.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:50.934
That means
anybody who can fly

00:15:50.968 --> 00:15:53.205
is able come and go from
there as they please.

00:15:53.239 --> 00:15:54.775
We should send
reinforcements.

00:15:54.809 --> 00:15:55.777
What reinforcements?

00:15:55.811 --> 00:15:57.280
We may have won
the battle here,

00:15:57.313 --> 00:15:59.484
but it's still left
our army in tatters.

00:15:59.518 --> 00:16:00.654
In this state,

00:16:00.687 --> 00:16:03.158
there's no one able-bodied
enough that's worth sending.

00:16:04.696 --> 00:16:06.031
Chiu: Sure there is...

00:16:06.064 --> 00:16:08.335
You can leave this one to me.

00:16:10.106 --> 00:16:11.208
What d'you think?

00:16:11.241 --> 00:16:13.245
He still has some spirit,
that's for sure.

00:16:13.278 --> 00:16:16.117
My friends, it's up to us
to face the Dark King.

00:16:16.151 --> 00:16:18.890
Sending troops who are injured
or running low on stamina

00:16:18.924 --> 00:16:20.594
will just lead
to more casualties -

00:16:20.627 --> 00:16:21.762
and we don't want that.

00:16:21.796 --> 00:16:23.232
But Terry, Rumbles,
and Drack-Drack

00:16:23.265 --> 00:16:25.069
are the only Commandos
who can fly...

00:16:25.102 --> 00:16:27.140
We can take a party of three.

00:16:27.173 --> 00:16:30.012
Having said that, he's
probably the weakest one here.

00:16:30.045 --> 00:16:31.281
Ha! "Probably"?

00:16:31.314 --> 00:16:33.520
Obviously, as captain of
the Beast King Commandos,

00:16:33.553 --> 00:16:34.855
I will lead the way...

00:16:34.888 --> 00:16:36.124
So... two more!

00:16:36.158 --> 00:16:38.362
I'm gonna need someone
who packs enough punch

00:16:38.395 --> 00:16:40.466
to knock the wind out
of the Dark Army...

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:43.072
I'm looking at you,
Crocodine. You with me?

00:16:43.106 --> 00:16:45.476
Of course. Did you
really have to ask?

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:46.746
Sorry, Chiu.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.251
I wish I could tag along, but
I've got my hands full as it is.

00:16:49.284 --> 00:16:50.588
Ah, don't sweat it, pal.

00:16:50.621 --> 00:16:51.856
I totally understand.

00:16:51.889 --> 00:16:53.993
You need to be looking
after Lon Beruk.

00:16:54.027 --> 00:16:56.064
One more person.
Who'll it be?

00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:57.969
Ideally, someone
who can heal...

00:16:58.002 --> 00:17:00.240
Lady Amy [thought]: Pick me,
pick me, pick me,

00:17:00.273 --> 00:17:02.845
pick me, pick me, pick me,
pick me, pick me...

00:17:02.878 --> 00:17:07.220
Pick me, pick me, pick me,
pick me, pick me, pick me...

00:17:07.253 --> 00:17:08.523
Chiu [thought]:
I'm not sure why,

00:17:08.557 --> 00:17:11.061
but I sense incredible
pressure all of a sudden...

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:13.533
Chiu: How about Mr. Beast!

00:17:14.267 --> 00:17:15.604
Lady Amy [thought]: Aw, what?

00:17:15.637 --> 00:17:20.012
An unstoppable trio.
But just in case...

00:17:20.045 --> 00:17:21.414
Chiu: Listen up!

00:17:21.448 --> 00:17:23.654
If you have any healing items
left, toss 'em in the bag.

00:17:23.687 --> 00:17:25.389
Every little bit helps.

00:17:34.207 --> 00:17:36.780
Chiu: Crocodine? Look alive!
We're ready to move out.

00:17:36.813 --> 00:17:38.081
Right.

00:17:43.258 --> 00:17:44.929
Lady Amy [thought]:
I suppose I should stay

00:17:44.962 --> 00:17:46.465
to keep healing Merle, anyway.

00:17:46.498 --> 00:17:48.803
It's not how I wanted
it to go, but...

00:17:48.836 --> 00:17:50.707
They'll help you, Hyunckel...

00:17:59.692 --> 00:18:02.130
I've returned to this
dreadful place once again...

00:18:02.163 --> 00:18:06.104
Except, this time
I'm not going to lose!

00:18:06.138 --> 00:18:08.811
Chiu: So, this is the
infamous Vearn Palace, huh?

00:18:08.844 --> 00:18:09.946
Crocodine: Hey, Chiu...

00:18:09.979 --> 00:18:11.749
Crocodine: These
three look exhausted.

00:18:11.783 --> 00:18:12.918
We should send them back.

00:18:12.952 --> 00:18:14.287
Chiu: Yeah, you're right.

00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:15.857
Nice work, you guys.

00:18:15.891 --> 00:18:17.193
We can take it from here.

00:18:17.227 --> 00:18:19.932
You double back to Loroi
Valley and await our return.

00:18:19.965 --> 00:18:21.235
It won't be long.

00:18:21.268 --> 00:18:22.571
Don't worry about us.

00:18:22.604 --> 00:18:25.009
We'll find Dai's party,
help them defeat the Dark King,

00:18:25.042 --> 00:18:26.580
and be back in no time!

00:18:26.613 --> 00:18:28.015
Trust me. It'll be fine.

00:18:28.049 --> 00:18:30.854
Chiu: I'll even swear
on my Commando badge!

00:18:31.822 --> 00:18:35.864
Chiu: [laughing]

00:18:35.898 --> 00:18:38.503
Crocodine [thought]: This little
runt may not be the strongest,

00:18:38.537 --> 00:18:41.341
but he's got more heart than
the rest of us put together.

00:18:41.374 --> 00:18:45.617
Someday, he might even be
a force to be reckoned with.

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:47.253
Let's move out!

00:18:48.455 --> 00:18:50.593
I wonder where
everyone else is.

00:18:57.941 --> 00:19:02.350
Well, well. That was a solid
hit, now wasn't it, Hyunckel?

00:19:05.056 --> 00:19:06.358
Hyunckel [thought]:
His power and speed

00:19:06.392 --> 00:19:08.161
are both totally
off the charts.

00:19:08.195 --> 00:19:11.167
I didn't have any time
to react to that at all.

00:19:11.201 --> 00:19:13.840
So, this is the
power of "Aura"?

00:19:13.874 --> 00:19:15.644
I must admit,
it's remarkable.

00:19:15.677 --> 00:19:18.115
It's as if it allows
me to channel my anger

00:19:18.148 --> 00:19:20.787
directly into
every move I make.

00:19:24.327 --> 00:19:26.565
Oh, don't tell me
it's over already?

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:28.903
I was just beginning
to enjoy this.

00:19:28.937 --> 00:19:30.807
You must have more for me.

00:19:35.015 --> 00:19:37.020
Or perhaps it really is over.

00:19:37.053 --> 00:19:39.490
What a pity. I thought
you were special.

00:19:39.525 --> 00:19:40.794
Hyunckel [thought]:
It's no use...

00:19:40.828 --> 00:19:43.533
With all the energy I've
spent fighting those beasts,

00:19:43.566 --> 00:19:46.171
I don't have enough Aura
to keep up with him.

00:19:46.204 --> 00:19:47.473
And meanwhile,

00:19:47.508 --> 00:19:50.613
he's practically overflowing
with Aura of his own.

00:19:50.647 --> 00:19:53.085
I'm not a match for
him like this...

00:19:53.119 --> 00:19:54.789
There must be another way.

00:19:54.822 --> 00:19:56.892
How can I fight? How?

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:01.101
Hyunckel [thought]: No, no...

00:20:01.135 --> 00:20:03.840
I'm starting to lose
sense of my body.

00:20:03.873 --> 00:20:09.017
I can't afford to fail here.
The others are counting on me.

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:10.654
Dai...

00:20:10.687 --> 00:20:11.956
Popp...

00:20:15.196 --> 00:20:16.732
M-Maam...

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:34.433
Avan: Hyunckel...
Hyunckel...

00:20:36.806 --> 00:20:38.408
Fight it...

00:20:38.441 --> 00:20:41.048
Just open your
eyes and stand...

00:20:41.081 --> 00:20:42.551
Wake up!

00:20:48.329 --> 00:20:49.532
Come on, young man.

00:20:49.565 --> 00:20:51.234
Have you forgotten
your lessons?

00:20:51.268 --> 00:20:53.873
You still aren't doing
what I told you to do.

00:20:53.906 --> 00:20:57.080
I'm... not doing...
what you told me to do?

00:20:57.113 --> 00:20:58.248
Yes, that's right.

00:20:58.282 --> 00:20:59.852
There's no shame
in accepting defeat

00:20:59.885 --> 00:21:03.759
if you've given the battle
everything you can, but...

00:21:03.793 --> 00:21:05.530
I don't believe
you're finished yet.

00:21:05.564 --> 00:21:07.535
Stop fixating
on what you've lost;

00:21:07.568 --> 00:21:09.303
think of something
you can do.

00:21:09.337 --> 00:21:10.472
Sometimes, the only way to

00:21:10.507 --> 00:21:12.410
surpass our
perceived limitations -

00:21:12.443 --> 00:21:14.949
is to use what's within.

00:21:14.982 --> 00:21:17.587
Avan: Otherwise, you'll never
tap into your full potential

00:21:17.621 --> 00:21:20.125
and become your
strongest self.

00:21:20.159 --> 00:21:21.762
Give your opponent
everything you have,

00:21:21.795 --> 00:21:24.668
summon the force that
ignites your very essence.

00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:27.541
That's what makes
a true warrior.

00:21:37.661 --> 00:21:38.729
There we go.

00:21:38.763 --> 00:21:42.871
That's more like it. On your
feet, my eternal rival.

00:21:42.905 --> 00:21:45.376
Give me a challenge.

00:21:45.409 --> 00:21:47.347
Hyunckel [thought]:
It's such a peculiar thing.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.685
I used to despise
you with all my heart...

00:21:49.718 --> 00:21:53.727
So much that I once
even wanted to end you.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.797
Hyunckel [thought]:
But I see now, Master...

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:57.466
Whenever I fell,

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.239
something would make always
me get back up again.

00:22:00.272 --> 00:22:03.646
It was you...
Every single time.

00:23:36.866 --> 00:23:39.104
Narrator: After dragging himself
back from the brink of defeat,

00:23:39.137 --> 00:23:42.009
Hyunckel summons the last of
his energy to take down Hym...

00:23:42.043 --> 00:23:45.082
But the Orichalcum warrior
is imbued with Hadlar's spirit,

00:23:45.116 --> 00:23:47.453
making a fiercer opponent
than ever before.

00:23:47.487 --> 00:23:49.892
With his Aura depleted
and his stamina fading,

00:23:49.926 --> 00:23:52.397
it seems as if Hyunckel
faces certain doom...

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:54.634
until he decides to
unleash one final gambit.

00:23:54.668 --> 00:23:57.808
Hyunckel or Hym: In a clash
of wills, who will survive?

00:23:57.841 --> 00:23:59.512
