WEBVTT

00:02:07.855 --> 00:02:09.626
[pained groan]

00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:15.070
What's the matter?

00:02:15.104 --> 00:02:16.406
You were so
determined at the start,

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.877
but now you might as
well be a punching bag.

00:02:18.911 --> 00:02:21.082
Hym: Come on.
Fight back a little.

00:02:21.116 --> 00:02:23.588
Give me another taste
of your Bloody Scryde.

00:02:23.621 --> 00:02:25.591
Or how about your
Air Strike attack?

00:02:25.624 --> 00:02:28.163
That might make
this interesting.

00:02:28.197 --> 00:02:29.967
Hyunckel: I'd just
be wasting my time.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.335
Hym...

00:02:31.368 --> 00:02:33.439
Can't you see that you've
become far more than a pawn?

00:02:33.473 --> 00:02:35.912
At this point, even if
I cast my Bloody Scryde,

00:02:35.945 --> 00:02:37.716
you'd just deflect it.

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:38.884
And in your new form,

00:02:38.917 --> 00:02:41.422
my Air Strike won't be of
any use against you, either.

00:02:41.455 --> 00:02:42.959
Hyunckel: As a matter of fact,

00:02:42.992 --> 00:02:44.462
I'd wager that
most of my attacks

00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:46.465
won't have much
effect on you now.

00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:48.170
In the game of chess,

00:02:48.203 --> 00:02:49.673
a pawn that's
journeyed all the way

00:02:49.706 --> 00:02:51.943
to the farthest end of the
enemy's territory can gain

00:02:51.977 --> 00:02:55.183
the abilities of a queen or
the other high-level pieces,

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:57.421
and I believe that's
what happened to you.

00:02:57.454 --> 00:03:00.628
Hym [thought]: The
promotion... of a pawn?

00:03:00.661 --> 00:03:02.699
After all, that silver
hair you've grown...

00:03:02.732 --> 00:03:05.070
could be proof that
you've transformed...

00:03:05.103 --> 00:03:07.007
Proof that you've
completed your evolution

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.579
into a truly
top-class warrior.

00:03:10.213 --> 00:03:11.316
And what's your point?

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.252
Are you telling me
that if you can't win,

00:03:13.286 --> 00:03:15.658
you're just going to
give up fighting altogether?!

00:03:15.691 --> 00:03:22.705
[pained groans]

00:03:35.565 --> 00:03:36.967
Hym [thought]: No, wait...

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.572
That's not the look of someone
who's accepted their defeat.

00:03:39.606 --> 00:03:41.544
He still has
something up his sleeve.

00:03:41.577 --> 00:03:43.981
The only question is - what?

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:45.083
Hyunckel [thought]:
That's better.

00:03:45.116 --> 00:03:47.020
I'm beginning to
see some of the weakness

00:03:47.054 --> 00:03:48.490
in Hym's movements.

00:03:48.524 --> 00:03:51.263
Right after he throws
that destructive left jab,

00:03:51.296 --> 00:03:53.299
his entire body freezes.

00:03:53.332 --> 00:03:54.969
It may only be for an instant,

00:03:55.003 --> 00:03:57.308
but that's all
the opening I need.

00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:59.245
I'll have to time
it just right and

00:03:59.278 --> 00:04:00.949
attack with every
ounce of my strength...

00:04:00.982 --> 00:04:04.088
And that calls for the
heaviest hitter in my arsenal.

00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:05.624
Here he comes.

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.051
Bring it on!

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:23.961
[roaring]

00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:29.371
Your little toys are
all but useless against me.

00:04:30.173 --> 00:04:32.410
This is the end
for you, Hyunckel!

00:04:42.798 --> 00:04:43.600
Th-this is...

00:04:43.634 --> 00:04:44.737
Hyunckel [thought]:
My Grand Cross.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.841
Someone as fast as
you are could dodge it,

00:04:46.874 --> 00:04:49.312
but if I hold you
down and fire inward,

00:04:49.345 --> 00:04:50.748
there's no escape.

00:04:50.782 --> 00:04:54.021
Now, time for me to drag
you back to the Underworld!

00:04:54.054 --> 00:04:56.560
[furious roar]

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:11.455
Hym [thought]:
So that was his plan.

00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:14.228
He put all his chips on
a self-sacrificing move,

00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:16.466
hoping to take me with him.

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:19.873
That might've worked if you had
a chance at restraining me.

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:27.421
But this settles it...

00:05:27.454 --> 00:05:30.393
Victory is all mine, Hyunckel!

00:05:30.426 --> 00:05:32.331
Hyunckel [thought]: If
I were in peak condition,

00:05:32.364 --> 00:05:34.302
this would've gone
the other way.

00:05:34.335 --> 00:05:36.507
But I've already used
Grand Cross twice,

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.009
and with my energy
running low,

00:05:38.043 --> 00:05:41.616
I couldn't focus my Aura before
he was able to counter it.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.459
I've used every weapon and all
the energy I have, Master Avan.

00:05:46.492 --> 00:05:48.396
There's nothing
left for me to do.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.999
I'm out of options.

00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:56.814
I mean, don't get me wrong.

00:05:56.847 --> 00:05:58.650
It's definitely
better than nothing...

00:05:58.684 --> 00:06:01.857
It's just kind of weird
having you heal me, is all.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:02.793
[chuckling]

00:06:02.826 --> 00:06:04.629
Tell me about it.
It's new for me, too.

00:06:04.663 --> 00:06:06.967
Like, really - I just
figured out that spell.

00:06:07.001 --> 00:06:07.936
Hey, wait a minute.

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:09.740
If you're able to cast
Healing-type spells,

00:06:09.773 --> 00:06:13.112
then why were you so desperate
to have Maam do it? Huh?

00:06:14.215 --> 00:06:15.518
Because...

00:06:15.551 --> 00:06:18.524
I-I really was out of
Magic Power back then, okay?!

00:06:18.557 --> 00:06:21.329
Shut up! Ugh - you little...

00:06:21.362 --> 00:06:23.534
Maam [thought]:
Popp is amazing...

00:06:23.567 --> 00:06:25.270
It feels like
there's less and less

00:06:25.304 --> 00:06:27.407
need for me the
better they get.

00:06:28.944 --> 00:06:30.147
Popp: Well, okay then.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.119
We're fully healed up and ready
for another bout, aren't we?

00:06:33.152 --> 00:06:34.722
Come and give us
your worst!

00:06:34.756 --> 00:06:37.060
You hear that, Dark Army?!

00:06:44.642 --> 00:06:46.947
Popp: I gotta say, this
whole eerie silence thing?

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.584
It's pretty unsettling.

00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:51.055
Shouldn't Master Avan
and Leona be back?

00:06:51.088 --> 00:06:51.857
Yeah.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.727
They've been gone
for a while now.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.932
Even stranger, the fact
that we've been camped out

00:06:55.965 --> 00:06:57.768
in the middle of the
enemy stronghold and

00:06:57.802 --> 00:07:01.275
nobody's even tried to ambush us
is actually sort of a bad sign.

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:03.212
In fact, it usually
means that...

00:07:03.246 --> 00:07:04.448
Mystvearn: Exactly.

00:07:04.481 --> 00:07:06.218
It means you're not alone...

00:07:06.251 --> 00:07:09.258
and that whoever is guarding
this area is so powerful,

00:07:09.291 --> 00:07:13.232
they have no need for the
assistance of underlings.

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:15.672
It means even if
you're fully healed,

00:07:15.705 --> 00:07:18.910
you're still too weak
to stand a chance.

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:23.820
Look who it is.

00:07:25.023 --> 00:07:27.194
Mystvearn: Where you stand is
known as the White Garden;

00:07:27.228 --> 00:07:28.898
the heart of Vearn Palace.

00:07:28.931 --> 00:07:31.703
It leads directly to
the Tower of Supremacy,

00:07:31.737 --> 00:07:34.609
and past that is King
Vearn's inner sanctum.

00:07:34.642 --> 00:07:36.412
It's the most beautiful place

00:07:36.445 --> 00:07:40.120
in all the halls of
our grand fortress.

00:07:40.153 --> 00:07:41.322
Yeah? Big deal.

00:07:41.355 --> 00:07:43.727
What is this, a
sightseeing tour?

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.332
Mystvearn: I simply thought
that you hopeless little brats

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:48.202
would like to know
the name of the place

00:07:48.235 --> 00:07:49.772
where you're
going to die.

00:07:49.806 --> 00:07:50.974
Oh, yeah?

00:07:56.686 --> 00:08:00.661
Hyunckel [thought]: No, not yet.
I can't afford to give up...

00:08:00.695 --> 00:08:02.230
Not with the others
counting on me.

00:08:02.263 --> 00:08:05.504
Leona said that fortitude
is the power of my soul.

00:08:05.538 --> 00:08:08.342
So long as I have even
I shred of fighting spirit,

00:08:08.375 --> 00:08:12.150
I must rise again and try
to strike down my adversary.

00:08:16.492 --> 00:08:18.062
Hym [thought]: Lord Hadlar.

00:08:18.095 --> 00:08:21.101
I hope whatever part
of you remains can see.

00:08:21.135 --> 00:08:24.675
A Disciple of Avan has
been defeated at last.

00:08:29.752 --> 00:08:32.591
Hym [thought]:
Incredible. Is he immortal?

00:08:36.265 --> 00:08:38.370
Hym [thought]:
No, just stubborn.

00:08:38.403 --> 00:08:40.541
So he wants to go down
fighting, does he?

00:08:40.574 --> 00:08:41.810
Hym: Very well.

00:08:43.312 --> 00:08:44.682
Take your spear.

00:08:45.952 --> 00:08:49.792
Appreciate the gesture, but I
don't think I'll be using it.

00:08:49.826 --> 00:08:53.199
Matter of fact, I shouldn't
need my armor, either.

00:08:57.307 --> 00:08:58.777
Hym: What...

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.282
What are you doing?!

00:09:01.316 --> 00:09:03.588
Pitting Aura against Aura.

00:09:03.621 --> 00:09:05.423
And now that I've
cast aside everything

00:09:05.457 --> 00:09:07.327
in order to fight
you on even ground,

00:09:07.361 --> 00:09:09.164
I hope you're ready
to finish this.

00:09:09.198 --> 00:09:12.738
We'll settle it once and for
all... using only our fists!

00:09:14.474 --> 00:09:16.446
Hym: Are you out of your mind?

00:09:16.479 --> 00:09:19.051
I was formed from
Orichalcum, you fool.

00:09:19.084 --> 00:09:21.724
A human like you will
never stand a chance

00:09:21.757 --> 00:09:23.159
using bare fists alone.

00:09:23.193 --> 00:09:25.296
Hyunckel: Doesn't
matter if it works or not.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:26.967
I still have to try.

00:09:27.001 --> 00:09:31.075
This fist, it's the only weapon
I have left - my last chance.

00:09:31.109 --> 00:09:33.748
The only option I have
left is to take a gamble

00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:35.718
and hope that this works...

00:09:35.751 --> 00:09:38.223
If I fail -
oblivion awaits me!

00:09:38.256 --> 00:09:39.224
And, that's why...

00:09:39.258 --> 00:09:42.197
That's why you discarded
your armor and spear?

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:45.704
For this to work, I needed to
force myself into a corner.

00:09:45.738 --> 00:09:47.508
Hym [thought]: I knew it!

00:09:47.542 --> 00:09:49.612
It's how I awoke to
the Aura of Light

00:09:49.646 --> 00:09:51.048
the first time,
and back then...

00:09:51.081 --> 00:09:53.587
I could tear steel
with these hands!

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.925
The flame of my life
force may be growing dim...

00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.530
but if I turn all
of it into Aura

00:09:58.564 --> 00:10:00.701
and focus that
power into my fist,

00:10:00.735 --> 00:10:01.837
it should have
enough strength

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.342
to put a few dents
in Orichalcum.

00:10:04.375 --> 00:10:05.611
Prepare yourself, Hym.

00:10:05.644 --> 00:10:08.282
You're about to face
the last of my power.

00:10:09.986 --> 00:10:11.723
How remarkable.

00:10:11.756 --> 00:10:14.128
This is more than just
a desperate measure.

00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:16.700
I can see that much...

00:10:16.733 --> 00:10:19.138
And yet you're still
wasting your time, Hyunckel.

00:10:19.171 --> 00:10:20.875
You may put up an
impressive fight,

00:10:20.908 --> 00:10:23.146
but your arrogance
betrays you.

00:10:23.179 --> 00:10:26.051
You've forgotten one
very important thing.

00:10:31.195 --> 00:10:37.407
[roaring]

00:10:49.733 --> 00:10:53.773
[roaring]

00:10:55.578 --> 00:10:57.314
Two can play at your game.

00:10:57.347 --> 00:10:59.853
And since my Heat Knuckle
has been infused with

00:10:59.886 --> 00:11:02.357
the very same power
you seek to wield...

00:11:02.391 --> 00:11:04.295
Now it's an Aura Knuckle.

00:11:04.328 --> 00:11:06.366
It's no ordinary weapon.

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:08.570
We both know the score.

00:11:08.603 --> 00:11:10.741
How formidable
Orichalcum can be

00:11:10.774 --> 00:11:13.146
when it's channeling
the strength of an Aura.

00:11:13.179 --> 00:11:15.584
It doesn't really matter
what you cast aside.

00:11:15.618 --> 00:11:17.789
In the end, you're
not a match for me.

00:11:17.822 --> 00:11:19.191
My Aura Knuckle...

00:11:19.224 --> 00:11:22.531
has as much power as
any Legendary Sword.

00:11:22.564 --> 00:11:24.703
How do you think
you would fare...

00:11:24.736 --> 00:11:27.107
against Dai or Lord
Hadlar empty-handed

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.612
while they wielded
their weapons?

00:11:29.646 --> 00:11:31.883
Obviously, not well.

00:11:32.919 --> 00:11:34.822
I wouldn't even
call it a fight.

00:11:34.855 --> 00:11:37.595
A single hit with this will
obliterate any opponent -

00:11:37.628 --> 00:11:40.333
even if they were
wearing armor.

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:42.271
And if it's up to me...

00:11:42.304 --> 00:11:45.544
I'd rather not see you go
out in such a pitiful way.

00:11:45.578 --> 00:11:46.880
Then what?

00:11:46.913 --> 00:11:49.719
Defeating you was my first
purpose - the only purpose

00:11:49.752 --> 00:11:52.592
of mine in the life that
my master has granted me.

00:11:52.625 --> 00:11:54.494
I could sense it from
the very beginning,

00:11:54.528 --> 00:11:56.800
back when we first
met in combat.

00:11:56.833 --> 00:11:58.202
You parade around,

00:11:58.236 --> 00:12:01.208
acting as if you're the toughest
person that ever existed.

00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:04.849
Turning that cool expression
of yours into one of pure fear

00:12:04.883 --> 00:12:07.120
has been a dream
of mine ever since.

00:12:07.154 --> 00:12:08.489
I believed that
doing so would

00:12:08.523 --> 00:12:11.796
appease the spirit that
Lord Hadlar left me with.

00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:13.900
But if you're going to die,
you deserve better.

00:12:13.933 --> 00:12:16.973
I won't allow you to lose
in such a miserable manner.

00:12:17.006 --> 00:12:18.910
I want you to die
as you lived...

00:12:18.944 --> 00:12:22.518
With that insufferable,
smug look on your face.

00:12:22.552 --> 00:12:24.956
You know, the first
time we fought,

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:28.295
you also told me something that
seems rather fitting for this:

00:12:28.329 --> 00:12:31.002
You said that it was better
to die a beautiful death

00:12:31.035 --> 00:12:33.272
than to live on in disgrace.

00:12:34.709 --> 00:12:36.813
I stopped fearing
my death long ago.

00:12:36.847 --> 00:12:38.148
And it may be true that...

00:12:38.182 --> 00:12:40.420
there was once a time where
I would have preferred

00:12:40.453 --> 00:12:44.061
a glorious end over
leading a life of disgrace.

00:12:44.094 --> 00:12:46.298
But... that time has passed.

00:12:47.167 --> 00:12:49.004
My friends have
shown me the truth -

00:12:49.037 --> 00:12:51.175
and glory has
nothing to do with it.

00:12:51.208 --> 00:12:53.614
A true warrior
can never give up,

00:12:53.647 --> 00:12:55.416
not until they've
fulfilled their purpose

00:12:55.449 --> 00:12:57.020
and carried out their duty...

00:12:57.053 --> 00:12:58.957
That's serving others.

00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:01.261
Even when in the face
of immeasurable danger

00:13:01.294 --> 00:13:03.466
and it seems
completely hopeless.

00:13:03.499 --> 00:13:04.835
I don't care how disgraceful

00:13:04.869 --> 00:13:07.374
or pathetic the
end of that road is.

00:13:07.407 --> 00:13:08.309
I'll fight for it.

00:13:08.342 --> 00:13:10.446
If there's even a
sliver of a chance that

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.818
I can stop you,
I have to try.

00:13:13.987 --> 00:13:16.325
Hyunckel: So come on.
Who will it be, Hym?

00:13:16.358 --> 00:13:19.297
Can this fist carrying all
the fortitude of my soul

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.638
overcome you and your
implacable iron gauntlets?

00:13:22.671 --> 00:13:24.975
I think it's
time we found out.

00:13:26.244 --> 00:13:28.482
You really are
an incredible man.

00:13:28.517 --> 00:13:30.754
I finally understand now.

00:13:30.787 --> 00:13:31.923
Yes, I see it.

00:13:31.956 --> 00:13:33.526
That's the quality inside you

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.931
I always dreamt
of defeating.

00:13:35.965 --> 00:13:39.071
Well, you're some kind
of incredible yourself.

00:13:39.104 --> 00:13:41.743
You're the second
person I've encountered

00:13:41.777 --> 00:13:44.481
who was able to push
me past my limits.

00:13:47.387 --> 00:13:49.659
Hyunckel [thought]: I hope
you can see this, Avan.

00:13:49.692 --> 00:13:52.096
It's going to be
my last great gambit.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:56.205
Here we go!

00:13:56.238 --> 00:13:57.373
Hyunckel [thought]: Be ready.

00:13:57.407 --> 00:13:58.475
If he's backing up,

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:00.580
it means he's about to
unleash his greatest attack.

00:14:01.182 --> 00:14:08.262
[roaring]

00:14:09.899 --> 00:14:11.769
You want to risk
everything, do you?

00:14:11.803 --> 00:14:16.378
Hold still. I'll destroy
it all away. Take this!

00:14:16.411 --> 00:14:18.115
Aura Knuckle!

00:14:27.901 --> 00:14:29.337
I warned you.

00:14:32.879 --> 00:14:34.013
Wh- How?!

00:14:34.047 --> 00:14:36.419
Y-You... You should
be vaporized!

00:14:36.452 --> 00:14:37.688
I would have been, Hym.

00:14:37.721 --> 00:14:40.928
Except your fist never got
close enough to touch me.

00:14:40.961 --> 00:14:42.263
I'm just a lot faster,

00:14:42.297 --> 00:14:44.803
and my strike caught you
off-guard just now...

00:14:44.836 --> 00:14:47.240
Before you could land
a hit of your own.

00:14:50.079 --> 00:14:53.285
Hyunckel: But we have
our answer: My fist wins.

00:15:00.968 --> 00:15:02.004
Hyunckel [thought]:
He's finished.

00:15:02.037 --> 00:15:04.274
Hym was a mighty foe indeed.

00:15:04.307 --> 00:15:06.914
It took nearly everything
I had to put him down...

00:15:06.947 --> 00:15:08.482
I almost didn't make it.

00:15:10.921 --> 00:15:12.090
Dammit.

00:15:12.124 --> 00:15:15.931
How could... my Orichalcum
body failed me...

00:15:15.965 --> 00:15:18.202
It's because your
attack was that powerful.

00:15:18.235 --> 00:15:20.708
You should be proud of
yourself for such a feat.

00:15:20.741 --> 00:15:21.776
M-My attack?

00:15:21.809 --> 00:15:23.245
My strength and Aura combined

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:25.316
weren't enough to
shatter Orichalcum.

00:15:25.349 --> 00:15:28.957
I had to find a way to make
your own ability do it for me.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:30.694
To turn your attack
against you,

00:15:30.727 --> 00:15:32.497
I needed a counter
of some kind.

00:15:32.532 --> 00:15:34.869
The Avan Style has
a similar technique,

00:15:34.902 --> 00:15:37.206
so I decided to try
applying it to my fist.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.944
Looks like it worked
like a charm.

00:15:38.977 --> 00:15:40.714
That was the same
skill you used

00:15:40.748 --> 00:15:42.951
when you fought
against Baran...

00:15:42.985 --> 00:15:45.222
Hyunckel: But the Hollow
Stance requires a warrior to

00:15:45.256 --> 00:15:49.799
empty themselves and take on the
full force of an enemy's blow.

00:15:49.833 --> 00:15:54.074
If I had tried to do that here,
even with my Aura suppressed,

00:15:54.107 --> 00:15:56.512
I doubt I could have
survived a single strike.

00:15:56.546 --> 00:15:59.184
So I had no choice but
to try hitting you with

00:15:59.217 --> 00:16:02.558
my Aura-infused fist right
before you made impact,

00:16:02.592 --> 00:16:05.096
to dampen your charge enough
that I could handle it.

00:16:05.129 --> 00:16:06.799
It required perfect timing -

00:16:06.832 --> 00:16:08.503
a true moment
of life or death -

00:16:08.537 --> 00:16:10.741
with no guarantee
that it would work.

00:16:10.774 --> 00:16:14.147
But somehow, I managed
to pull it off.

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:17.453
I believe... it's all
because you willingly

00:16:17.487 --> 00:16:20.895
took the bait when I offered
you a head-on challenge.

00:16:20.928 --> 00:16:22.263
If you had taken your time,

00:16:22.297 --> 00:16:24.067
I imagine that you
could've easily used

00:16:24.101 --> 00:16:26.271
your martial arts to
whittle me down...

00:16:26.304 --> 00:16:29.377
With me exhausted, you
could've claimed victory.

00:16:30.647 --> 00:16:32.584
Hym: I'd never do that.

00:16:32.618 --> 00:16:33.586
It wouldn't be fair.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.058
Even if I knew that it
would bring me victory,

00:16:36.091 --> 00:16:39.532
I'd never do such
a thing. Not ever.

00:16:39.565 --> 00:16:40.601
It would be pointless.

00:16:40.634 --> 00:16:43.205
There's no honor in
beating you that way.

00:16:43.239 --> 00:16:46.311
I would've given my life to
win, but I'd much rather die

00:16:46.344 --> 00:16:49.585
than lower myself to
such a cowardly tactic.

00:16:49.618 --> 00:16:50.855
You're right...

00:16:50.888 --> 00:16:52.591
It hurts...

00:16:52.625 --> 00:16:55.262
More than I've ever hurt
before. It's incredible.

00:16:55.296 --> 00:16:56.933
Wounds like this
used to cause

00:16:56.966 --> 00:16:59.370
only the slightest
hint of pain...

00:16:59.404 --> 00:17:04.213
I suppose... this must be the
agony of the living. Isn't it?

00:17:05.182 --> 00:17:07.219
You've defeated me,
once again.

00:17:07.253 --> 00:17:10.761
And now it's time to finish me
off, as a victor should...

00:17:10.794 --> 00:17:13.098
Don't make me wait, Hyunckel!

00:17:24.889 --> 00:17:26.391
What... What are you doing?

00:17:26.424 --> 00:17:27.928
I've fought you enough to know

00:17:27.962 --> 00:17:30.500
you deserve a better
death than this.

00:17:30.534 --> 00:17:33.005
If you can reach my
friends inside the palace,

00:17:33.039 --> 00:17:35.376
they could use their
magic to heal you.

00:17:36.545 --> 00:17:38.216
You heard me.
Now, on your feet.

00:17:38.249 --> 00:17:41.087
Join you? Are you
kidding? Not a chance!

00:17:41.121 --> 00:17:43.960
I gave this my all and
I lost, fair and square!

00:17:43.994 --> 00:17:48.035
I don't have any regrets, and
I don't need your pity, either.

00:17:48.069 --> 00:17:51.743
It isn't pity. It's an
order. Make no mistake.

00:17:51.776 --> 00:17:53.747
You're giving me orders?

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:54.849
Why shouldn't I?

00:17:54.882 --> 00:17:56.185
If a warrior has the right to

00:17:56.218 --> 00:17:58.823
take the life of an
opponent they've defeated,

00:17:58.857 --> 00:18:00.359
I'll take your
death instead...

00:18:00.392 --> 00:18:03.265
and that would
leave you in my debt.

00:18:03.298 --> 00:18:05.170
Hyunckel: I can
tell that in your heart,

00:18:05.203 --> 00:18:07.207
you're no longer evil.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.144
You might have wanted
to take me down,

00:18:09.177 --> 00:18:11.749
but your reasons for
doing so were pure.

00:18:11.782 --> 00:18:14.354
Either way, now that
our duel is finished,

00:18:14.387 --> 00:18:17.160
I have no desire to
do you any more harm.

00:18:17.193 --> 00:18:18.663
But I... I'm not worthy.

00:18:18.697 --> 00:18:21.503
It doesn't matter. But
I'll tell you what does.

00:18:21.536 --> 00:18:24.141
Your life is no longer
your own to give.

00:18:24.174 --> 00:18:26.378
You carry on the will
of Lord Hadlar and

00:18:26.412 --> 00:18:28.683
the fallen members
of the Royal Guard.

00:18:28.717 --> 00:18:32.323
This new life; it's much
more than some "promotion".

00:18:32.356 --> 00:18:35.597
It's not about how far you've
travelled across the board.

00:18:35.631 --> 00:18:38.202
You returned... because
you have an obligation

00:18:38.235 --> 00:18:39.973
to keep your friends'
memory alive.

00:18:40.006 --> 00:18:42.544
That's the truth, isn't it?

00:18:44.515 --> 00:18:47.087
Hyunckel: I'm not saying
you have to join us.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.590
And for whatever it's worth,

00:18:48.623 --> 00:18:51.094
if I survive this
upcoming battle with Vearn,

00:18:51.127 --> 00:18:55.035
I'll gladly fight
you... again.

00:18:55.069 --> 00:18:56.071
It's your choice...

00:18:56.104 --> 00:18:57.908
But for now you live.

00:19:00.514 --> 00:19:03.252
That didn't really come out
the way I wanted it to.

00:19:03.285 --> 00:19:06.324
I'm not sure why, but when
my friends said it to me,

00:19:06.357 --> 00:19:08.596
it sounded a lot
kinder than that.

00:19:12.036 --> 00:19:13.573
Curse you and your arrogance.

00:19:13.607 --> 00:19:15.944
Am I meant to be
moved by this?

00:19:15.978 --> 00:19:17.213
Because I'll tell you now.

00:19:17.247 --> 00:19:19.551
If I could move,
I wouldn't join you.

00:19:19.585 --> 00:19:22.423
I'd punch you right in
that sentimental face.

00:19:22.457 --> 00:19:25.229
If you live, I
promise you can try.

00:19:41.596 --> 00:19:42.531
Not good.

00:19:42.564 --> 00:19:44.200
Wait. What's this rumbling?

00:19:44.234 --> 00:19:46.438
Mystvearn: It appears
the Janitor of Vearn Palace

00:19:46.472 --> 00:19:48.175
has finally lost patience.

00:19:48.208 --> 00:19:50.412
Now there's no
avoiding your demise.

00:19:50.446 --> 00:19:52.216
Who's the "Janitor"?

00:19:56.357 --> 00:19:57.460
What is this?

00:19:57.493 --> 00:19:59.330
Why are there seven
pawns just like me?

00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:02.036
And there's Sigma and Block
and Fenbren as well...

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.038
but how?!

00:20:03.072 --> 00:20:04.642
Maximum: [cackling]

00:20:04.675 --> 00:20:08.181
What are you talking about,
you worthless piece of scrap?

00:20:08.215 --> 00:20:09.484
Have you really forgotten?

00:20:09.518 --> 00:20:11.623
You and your
pathetic Royal Guard

00:20:11.656 --> 00:20:14.294
weren't the only pieces
on the chessboard.

00:20:14.327 --> 00:20:16.532
Our game involves
a king and queen,

00:20:16.566 --> 00:20:20.205
two bishops, two rooks, two
knights, and eight pawns...

00:20:20.239 --> 00:20:23.245
making a grand total
of sixteen pieces.

00:20:23.279 --> 00:20:26.686
The Dark King only gave
Hadlar five of those.

00:20:26.719 --> 00:20:29.825
Didn't you ever wonder
where the rest were?

00:20:31.762 --> 00:20:33.800
Maximum: Regardless,
of those sixteen pieces,

00:20:33.833 --> 00:20:37.107
there's only one which
possesses a will of its own...

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.679
And behold - it is I...

00:20:39.712 --> 00:20:42.951
The only one who has
the absolute confidence

00:20:42.985 --> 00:20:44.655
of His Dark Majesty.

00:20:44.688 --> 00:20:47.728
The palace's greatest and
most terrifying guardian...

00:20:47.761 --> 00:20:51.401
Maximum - king of
the chessboard!

00:20:53.907 --> 00:20:55.176
Hym: This isn't good.

00:20:55.209 --> 00:20:58.148
Hyunckel's still in tatters
and I can barely move at all.

00:20:58.181 --> 00:20:59.518
We'll never stand
a chance against

00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:01.523
this many Orichalcum warriors.

00:21:01.556 --> 00:21:03.259
It'll be a bloodbath.

00:21:03.292 --> 00:21:04.427
Run for it, Hyunckel!

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.732
Get as far from here
as you can! Leave me.

00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:07.801
It's all right.

00:21:07.834 --> 00:21:09.938
I'll deal with him.
You just stay where you are.

00:21:09.972 --> 00:21:11.208
I hope you can forgive me,

00:21:11.241 --> 00:21:13.078
but I don't think
I'll be able to

00:21:13.111 --> 00:21:14.882
hold up my end of our bargain.

00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:18.489
Either way, you still
have to survive.

00:21:18.523 --> 00:21:19.625
Got it?

00:21:19.658 --> 00:21:22.230
You have to get to my friends
and let them heal you.

00:21:22.263 --> 00:21:25.370
I'll buy you the time.
Don't waste it.

00:21:25.403 --> 00:21:28.743
No, wait... You don't
mean... Hyunckel!

00:21:28.776 --> 00:21:31.181
Hyunckel [thought]:
I think I might have to.

00:21:31.214 --> 00:21:33.018
I've fought all this way...

00:21:33.051 --> 00:21:35.524
charging into
the jaws of peril,

00:21:35.557 --> 00:21:37.962
believing that only pain
could make me forget

00:21:37.995 --> 00:21:39.998
the dark deeds of my past...

00:21:40.032 --> 00:21:43.372
So certain that if I spilled
enough blood and sweat,

00:21:43.405 --> 00:21:45.511
it would wash away my sins...

00:21:45.544 --> 00:21:49.751
Denying myself any feeling
or simple pleasure.

00:21:49.785 --> 00:21:50.887
And now...

00:21:55.195 --> 00:21:58.603
Hyunckel [thought]: Today,
all of that comes to an end.

00:21:58.636 --> 00:22:01.576
There's no doubt in
my mind. I can feel it.

00:22:01.609 --> 00:22:04.380
This will be my final battle.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:38.869
Narrator: Exhausted
by their duel,

00:23:38.903 --> 00:23:41.709
Hyunckel and Hym put their
newfound alliance to the test,

00:23:41.742 --> 00:23:43.947
facing Maximum and his
Orichalcum soldiers.

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.217
But Vearn Palace's most
formidable guardian

00:23:46.251 --> 00:23:47.788
lives up to his namesake,

00:23:47.821 --> 00:23:49.925
and while the others
square off with Mystvearn,

00:23:49.958 --> 00:23:52.496
Maximum and his forces
strike back without mercy.

00:23:52.531 --> 00:23:54.200
With peril closing
in from every angle,

00:23:54.234 --> 00:23:57.841
can Hyunckel and Hym overcome
the odds and claim the victory?

00:23:57.875 --> 00:24:00.312
