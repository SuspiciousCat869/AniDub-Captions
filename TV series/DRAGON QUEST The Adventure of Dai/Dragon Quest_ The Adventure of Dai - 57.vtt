WEBVTT

00:01:53.226 --> 00:01:55.732
Vearn: But I shall
grant you that chance.

00:01:55.765 --> 00:01:59.138
These two will not intervene.

00:01:59.172 --> 00:02:02.812
You have an opportunity
to defeat me at last.

00:02:02.846 --> 00:02:05.183
That is your reward.

00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:07.121
Shall we, then?

00:02:07.154 --> 00:02:09.358
Surely you won't refuse me?

00:02:09.392 --> 00:02:11.029
Well, of course not.

00:02:11.062 --> 00:02:13.466
Even if you had
Mystvearn and the Reaper-

00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:15.070
we're not gonna back down.

00:02:15.103 --> 00:02:16.238
We've come this far and

00:02:16.272 --> 00:02:18.745
won every battle
along the way.

00:02:18.778 --> 00:02:20.548
Vearn: Very well.

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:23.353
Then let us begin.

00:02:28.597 --> 00:02:31.235
I almost forgot.

00:02:31.268 --> 00:02:33.507
Vearn: That man.

00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:37.047
His ability to fight
was magnificent.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.156
He truly lived up to
the legends, but sadly,

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.896
it seems his heart
was far too human.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.100
At least let me
give him an end

00:02:47.134 --> 00:02:50.273
befitting such an
impressive creature.

00:03:03.801 --> 00:03:05.839
Everyone, run!

00:03:05.872 --> 00:03:07.809
Popp: It's a Kafrizz spell!

00:03:08.877 --> 00:03:10.313
Oh, no - Dad!

00:03:10.346 --> 00:03:11.951
[shocked gasps]

00:03:11.984 --> 00:03:15.691
Vearn: [chuckling]

00:03:15.724 --> 00:03:16.927
Disappointed?

00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:21.435
Or perhaps you had wished
to send him off yourself, boy?

00:03:21.804 --> 00:03:23.273
[roaring]

00:03:23.307 --> 00:03:25.210
W-Wait. Dai, don't!

00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:27.949
[gasps]

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:37.836
Oh, my.

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:42.111
It seems your precious little
Hero was the first to fall.

00:03:42.144 --> 00:03:43.748
And I don't believe any of you

00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:47.655
have the power
necessary to harm me.

00:03:49.392 --> 00:03:52.264
Crocodine [thought]: He took
down Dai with one blow?!

00:03:52.297 --> 00:03:55.137
Hyunckel [thought]:
I've never seen such power.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.508
Vearn: What a disappointment.

00:03:57.542 --> 00:04:00.313
I even gave him a chance.

00:04:00.347 --> 00:04:04.689
Instead you would
follow your father, Hero?

00:04:05.424 --> 00:04:07.862
You guys - we need to move!

00:04:09.732 --> 00:04:10.267
[charing yell]

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.003
I don't think so!

00:04:12.271 --> 00:04:14.843
Kafrizz!

00:04:20.922 --> 00:04:21.924
Now, Maam!

00:04:21.957 --> 00:04:24.228
I won't be able to
hold him off for very long.

00:04:24.261 --> 00:04:25.564
You have to heal Dai!

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:26.600
I'll try!

00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:31.776
[alarmed breath]

00:04:33.246 --> 00:04:35.518
[screaming]

00:04:35.551 --> 00:04:36.754
Popp!

00:04:36.787 --> 00:04:37.555
Both: Popp!

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:42.698
Hyunckel: No...

00:04:45.203 --> 00:04:46.940
Okay... That hurt.

00:04:46.974 --> 00:04:50.514
Did he really just burn
through enchanted clothing?

00:04:51.248 --> 00:04:52.151
[struggling grunt]

00:04:52.184 --> 00:04:54.723
And with such a tiny ember...

00:04:54.756 --> 00:04:56.826
How's it possible
that his Kafrizz spell

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.198
is so much stronger
than my own?!

00:04:59.232 --> 00:05:01.770
Kafrizz? Don't be absurd.

00:05:01.803 --> 00:05:05.377
It was a much simpler
spell than that.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.515
It's "Frizz."

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:09.385
A Frizz?!

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.690
I suppose no one told you.

00:05:11.723 --> 00:05:14.295
The effect of a spell
can vary greatly

00:05:14.328 --> 00:05:17.969
depending on the caster's
overall Magic Power.

00:05:18.002 --> 00:05:22.311
Even though they're both
fire-type spells, in essence...

00:05:22.344 --> 00:05:23.614
Any magic of mine

00:05:23.647 --> 00:05:26.720
will be unfathomably
greater than yours.

00:05:27.187 --> 00:05:28.223
W-What?!

00:05:28.256 --> 00:05:30.461
Vearn: Such a
difference in strength.

00:05:30.494 --> 00:05:31.830
You've managed to overwhelm

00:05:31.863 --> 00:05:35.437
the Dark Army's forces
time and time again,

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.644
so I assumed you would be
a little more powerful,

00:05:38.678 --> 00:05:40.881
but it seems I was wrong.

00:05:40.915 --> 00:05:44.556
Even the boy, Dai,
all I had to do was

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.098
use a small fraction of
my Aura to match his attack.

00:05:49.132 --> 00:05:51.068
Let me demonstrate.

00:06:03.026 --> 00:06:05.632
Hyunckel: Super-pressurized
Dark Aura...

00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:07.535
That's what he used on Dai?!

00:06:07.568 --> 00:06:10.975
Right - if we really
want to win this battle,

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:12.813
then we must fight as one!

00:06:12.846 --> 00:06:15.484
Maam, do you think
he's gonna be all right?

00:06:15.518 --> 00:06:17.454
His heart's beating, but...

00:06:17.488 --> 00:06:20.761
His body can only
take so much damage.

00:06:20.795 --> 00:06:24.434
Maam: He was hit precisely where
he'd already been wounded.

00:06:25.203 --> 00:06:28.476
Please... Just heal
him already!

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.180
I'm trying, but it won't work.

00:06:30.213 --> 00:06:31.750
It's no use.

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:35.423
As much as I enjoy
watching you weaklings

00:06:35.456 --> 00:06:38.262
struggle to summon
your courage...

00:06:38.296 --> 00:06:40.568
you're only wasting time.

00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:43.641
It seems like all
along I've miscalculated

00:06:43.674 --> 00:06:47.381
the Hero and his party's
prowess in battle.

00:06:47.414 --> 00:06:50.454
Even if Dai were still
amongst your ranks,

00:06:50.487 --> 00:06:52.892
it would change nothing.

00:06:52.925 --> 00:06:55.898
And so, as recompense
for my error,

00:06:55.931 --> 00:06:59.739
allow me to destroy
all of you, painlessly.

00:07:15.237 --> 00:07:17.742
This is my Kafrizz spell.

00:07:17.775 --> 00:07:19.444
With its unimaginable power

00:07:19.478 --> 00:07:22.250
and the graceful
form it takes on...

00:07:22.284 --> 00:07:25.557
it has its own name
in the Underworld.

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:29.197
Kaiser Phoenix.

00:07:35.143 --> 00:07:36.145
Hyunckel!

00:07:37.548 --> 00:07:39.318
Hyunckel: My armor
should be able to

00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:40.921
withstand it for a moment...

00:07:40.955 --> 00:07:42.692
Hurry and heal Dai!

00:07:46.498 --> 00:07:47.467
Another one?!

00:07:47.502 --> 00:07:49.539
But, how?! He's too fast!

00:07:58.089 --> 00:08:07.308
[pained screaming]

00:08:07.341 --> 00:08:10.013
I can't heal him like this!

00:08:10.046 --> 00:08:13.653
Everyone; we're going
on the offensive!

00:08:25.277 --> 00:08:28.750
Dark King... It's time!

00:08:38.604 --> 00:08:41.543
Hyunckel: Bloody... Scryde!

00:08:43.246 --> 00:08:44.014
Hyunckel: [surprised breath]

00:08:44.047 --> 00:08:45.951
Such optimism.

00:08:45.985 --> 00:08:47.220
Revolting.

00:08:47.253 --> 00:08:51.228
The darkness you kept
was far more magnificent.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.099
[roaring]

00:08:53.132 --> 00:08:55.103
[battle cry]

00:08:58.544 --> 00:09:00.313
Curse you!

00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:04.054
[pained scream]

00:09:08.597 --> 00:09:10.199
Crocodine!

00:09:11.937 --> 00:09:13.272
Look out!

00:09:17.982 --> 00:09:19.317
No - Hyunckel!

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.691
Popp: Hey - over here!

00:09:26.265 --> 00:09:27.668
My, my...

00:09:29.471 --> 00:09:30.574
Popp [thought]: Here goes...

00:09:30.607 --> 00:09:32.077
If I can't beat him with this,

00:09:32.111 --> 00:09:34.782
then I'll be completely
out of spells to try.

00:09:34.816 --> 00:09:37.187
So, please... work!

00:09:37.822 --> 00:09:39.592
Medroa!

00:09:42.363 --> 00:09:43.534
What?! No way...

00:09:43.567 --> 00:09:45.336
This is Bounce.

00:09:51.014 --> 00:09:53.152
Popp [thought]: I'll
have to cancel it out.

00:09:58.597 --> 00:09:59.665
Popp!

00:10:08.918 --> 00:10:11.122
Maam: Popp, are you okay?!

00:10:11.155 --> 00:10:12.123
Wh-what now?

00:10:12.157 --> 00:10:14.662
He managed to deflect
it with a Bounce spell.

00:10:14.696 --> 00:10:17.200
Even Medroa doesn't
seem to work.

00:10:17.233 --> 00:10:21.075
How did he conjure that
spell so quickly, anyway?!

00:10:21.108 --> 00:10:23.647
Hyunckel: He's on
a different level.

00:10:23.681 --> 00:10:24.582
Popp: Huh?

00:10:24.616 --> 00:10:26.753
His power seems
to be limitless.

00:10:26.787 --> 00:10:28.791
It's almost like
he can cast a spell

00:10:28.824 --> 00:10:32.230
without even needing
the time to charge it up.

00:10:32.264 --> 00:10:37.641
That lets him do two things in
the time it takes us to do one.

00:10:37.675 --> 00:10:39.178
So, while we're attacking,

00:10:39.211 --> 00:10:43.419
he can defend as he
conjures a counterstrike.

00:10:52.103 --> 00:10:54.909
Hey, Maam. Can you
take Dai, too?

00:10:54.943 --> 00:10:55.611
Huh?

00:10:55.644 --> 00:10:56.914
Get them to Crocodine.

00:10:56.947 --> 00:10:58.750
Then we'll Zoom outta here.

00:10:58.784 --> 00:11:00.788
It's the only
option we have left.

00:11:00.821 --> 00:11:02.190
Are you sure?

00:11:02.224 --> 00:11:05.731
Popp: There's nothing we can
do against a force like him.

00:11:05.764 --> 00:11:08.504
No wonder he's called
the God of the Underworld.

00:11:08.537 --> 00:11:10.641
We're being toyed with-

00:11:10.674 --> 00:11:12.410
like he's holding
back or something.

00:11:12.443 --> 00:11:13.981
If we really want
to fight him,

00:11:14.014 --> 00:11:15.584
we'll need to regroup first...

00:11:15.617 --> 00:11:17.353
or we're done for.

00:11:20.594 --> 00:11:21.963
Okay, then.

00:11:22.565 --> 00:11:24.702
C'mon. Here goes.

00:11:24.735 --> 00:11:26.171
Bye, old man!

00:11:29.779 --> 00:11:31.281
Popp: Zoom!

00:11:33.352 --> 00:11:34.822
Popp: What?! No!

00:11:34.855 --> 00:11:39.832
[pained groans]

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.210
What was that?!

00:11:45.243 --> 00:11:46.412
Killvearn: Poor things.

00:11:46.445 --> 00:11:50.119
They're just the picture
of hopelessness, aren't they?

00:11:50.654 --> 00:11:53.159
Do you understand, now?

00:11:53.193 --> 00:11:56.799
There's no one who
can escape the Dark King.

00:12:09.358 --> 00:12:11.162
Killvearn: [chuckling]

00:12:11.195 --> 00:12:15.103
The palace is shielded by
King Vearn's Magic Power.

00:12:15.136 --> 00:12:18.743
You won't be able to
escape it with a Zoom spell.

00:12:20.246 --> 00:12:23.787
Killvearn: Sure, you can
move within the force field.

00:12:23.821 --> 00:12:25.423
But while the
shield is active

00:12:25.456 --> 00:12:28.864
no one may enter... or leave.

00:12:28.897 --> 00:12:30.066
No one, that is,

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:34.976
except for certain
warriors of the Dark Army.

00:12:35.009 --> 00:12:37.515
Killvearn: If you'd tried
to fight instead of running,

00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:40.821
you might have lasted
just a little bit longer.

00:12:40.854 --> 00:12:42.024
[amused chuckle]

00:12:42.057 --> 00:12:44.295
But I guess
it's all the same.

00:12:44.328 --> 00:12:47.669
Either way, there's
nothing you can do.

00:12:47.702 --> 00:12:49.238
Piroro: You're all done for!

00:12:49.271 --> 00:12:50.841
You're all toast!

00:12:50.875 --> 00:12:52.645
[disagreeing chirps]

00:12:52.679 --> 00:12:54.314
What's your problem?

00:12:54.347 --> 00:12:57.387
I said that you're all
toast, toast, toast!

00:12:57.421 --> 00:12:58.857
[disagreeing chirps]

00:12:58.891 --> 00:13:01.061
Piroro:
You're! All! Done! For!

00:13:01.095 --> 00:13:02.296
Gomechan: [defiant chirps]

00:13:03.399 --> 00:13:04.769
They're quite right.

00:13:04.803 --> 00:13:06.973
Now, to finish the battle.

00:13:12.852 --> 00:13:15.289
I must have made contact...

00:13:15.824 --> 00:13:17.461
A minute ago...

00:13:17.494 --> 00:13:19.265
with my Refractor Fist!

00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:20.200
Right!

00:13:20.233 --> 00:13:22.370
Back when everyone
attacked all at once!

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.353
Killvearn: You landed
a hit. What a shock.

00:13:30.387 --> 00:13:31.823
Maam [thought]: It worked!

00:13:31.857 --> 00:13:35.230
That means the Dark King
is still a living creature.

00:13:35.263 --> 00:13:38.435
If I can hit him with
my Refractor Fist...

00:13:39.539 --> 00:13:42.277
Well, care to try?

00:13:42.311 --> 00:13:46.385
It's a one-in-a-million
chance of success, girl.

00:13:46.418 --> 00:13:51.596
My servants won't intervene and
if I happen to be wounded...

00:13:51.629 --> 00:13:55.036
My attacks will become slower.

00:13:55.069 --> 00:14:00.112
But, surely you know that
Darklings can regenerate.

00:14:02.116 --> 00:14:06.793
If you don't hurry,
you might lose your chance.

00:14:06.827 --> 00:14:08.830
Maam [thought]:
We can't escape,

00:14:08.863 --> 00:14:11.435
and I'm the only one
left who can fight...

00:14:11.468 --> 00:14:13.973
Vearn: What will you do?

00:14:14.007 --> 00:14:15.544
Maam [thought]:
I have to try!

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:17.881
Don't!

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:28.469
Slow down.

00:14:28.503 --> 00:14:31.374
We're not going to win
this thing by going in alone.

00:14:32.077 --> 00:14:33.513
Killvearn: Very sharp.

00:14:33.546 --> 00:14:37.621
The little Mage may
even be halfway useful.

00:14:37.655 --> 00:14:38.857
You were toying with me...

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.930
You could regenerate any time!

00:14:41.963 --> 00:14:43.634
You are so cruel.

00:14:43.667 --> 00:14:47.407
Maam: You enjoy playing
with us like that, don't you?

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.846
Of course I do.

00:14:49.879 --> 00:14:52.016
To obtain such
immeasurable power

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:55.725
and be able to use it
however you wish in life...

00:14:55.758 --> 00:14:58.129
Is that not pleasurable?

00:14:58.162 --> 00:15:00.968
Would you not feel superior?

00:15:01.001 --> 00:15:02.471
What do you mean?

00:15:02.505 --> 00:15:03.941
Power is the purest and

00:15:03.974 --> 00:15:07.147
most beautiful law of
the natural world.

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.721
"Survival of the fittest"
is how all creatures live.

00:15:10.755 --> 00:15:13.393
From Darklings to Dragons.

00:15:13.426 --> 00:15:17.000
Only you humans use
your so called "reason"...

00:15:17.033 --> 00:15:19.204
to deny the truth.

00:15:19.238 --> 00:15:23.146
But power is the only thing
that matters in the end.

00:15:23.179 --> 00:15:25.116
But how can you decide that?

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:28.121
Before you, monsters and
humans lived in peace.

00:15:28.155 --> 00:15:32.129
The Surface World isn't bound
by the same laws as yours!

00:15:33.566 --> 00:15:34.334
[startled breath]

00:15:34.367 --> 00:15:36.974
You are still
missing the point.

00:15:37.007 --> 00:15:39.444
The truth is that
peace can only ever be

00:15:39.477 --> 00:15:43.753
maintained by the
enforcement of a great power.

00:15:43.787 --> 00:15:45.156
A power...

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:48.696
Wielded only by the gods!

00:15:51.101 --> 00:15:53.539
Vearn: My home,
the Underworld,

00:15:53.573 --> 00:15:58.651
is a realm that exists deep
in the earth below your own.

00:15:58.684 --> 00:16:00.220
Everywhere you look...

00:16:00.253 --> 00:16:04.562
nothing but barren
rock and boiling magma.

00:16:04.595 --> 00:16:06.432
What's more, the sun,

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:10.507
the source of all life,
cannot shine below.

00:16:10.541 --> 00:16:11.776
The sun...

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:13.914
Such a magnificent power.

00:16:13.947 --> 00:16:16.185
But the gods granted the sun

00:16:16.218 --> 00:16:19.525
and the Surface World
to the humans,

00:16:19.559 --> 00:16:23.132
banishing Darklings and
Dragons to the Underworld...

00:16:23.165 --> 00:16:27.206
simply because the humans
were that much weaker.

00:16:29.979 --> 00:16:31.314
Vearn: If that was justice,

00:16:31.348 --> 00:16:34.589
then our power
is justice, as well.

00:16:34.622 --> 00:16:36.258
So I waited.

00:16:36.292 --> 00:16:38.763
Thousands of years
passed in that time.

00:16:38.797 --> 00:16:43.305
All while I honed my skills to
someday annihilate your world.

00:16:43.339 --> 00:16:46.779
Soon, it will be no more.

00:16:46.813 --> 00:16:49.885
And the sun will
finally shine...

00:16:49.918 --> 00:16:53.560
I will bring it
to the Underworld.

00:16:53.594 --> 00:16:54.929
When that happens...

00:16:54.963 --> 00:16:57.200
I...

00:16:57.233 --> 00:17:01.041
I shall become the
true god of the realm.

00:17:01.074 --> 00:17:05.182
And then, the great
folly of the old gods...

00:17:05.216 --> 00:17:08.088
will be corrected at last.

00:17:12.396 --> 00:17:15.203
Popp [thought]:
W-We can't win...

00:17:15.236 --> 00:17:18.375
He's thinking on a
whole different scale.

00:17:18.409 --> 00:17:21.214
For thousands of years,
he's seen the Surface World

00:17:21.248 --> 00:17:24.522
as nothing but a
weight over his own.

00:17:24.555 --> 00:17:25.725
We're just...

00:17:25.758 --> 00:17:27.861
We're just mere humans.

00:17:27.895 --> 00:17:30.667
We don't have a
hope of beating him.

00:17:31.736 --> 00:17:34.108
You've finally given up.

00:17:34.141 --> 00:17:37.247
This was more
enjoyable than I expected.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:41.021
You've done so well,
Heroes of the Surface.

00:17:41.054 --> 00:17:43.258
I'm not giving up yet.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.131
Both: D-Dai?!

00:17:46.165 --> 00:17:48.737
Dai: Even if everyone
else in the world has,

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:50.807
I still won't give up.

00:17:52.177 --> 00:17:54.080
Dai: I'll never give up!

00:17:54.114 --> 00:17:56.318
What impressive vitality.

00:17:56.352 --> 00:17:59.258
Could you repeat
that, young man?

00:17:59.291 --> 00:18:02.096
I'm sure I misheard you.

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:04.835
I said I'm not giving up.

00:18:04.869 --> 00:18:07.808
Even if there's
really no hope left.

00:18:07.841 --> 00:18:09.177
I'm going to keep on fighting

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.716
because it's what
I was meant to do.

00:18:11.749 --> 00:18:16.224
So, it seems I heard you
correctly the first time.

00:18:16.258 --> 00:18:18.596
Even after coming face
to face with my power,

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:21.703
you still won't
back down from this.

00:18:21.736 --> 00:18:26.077
Dai: I know exactly how
overwhelming your power can be.

00:18:26.111 --> 00:18:28.448
But that doesn't
matter anymore.

00:18:30.285 --> 00:18:34.762
Dai: You said that power is
justice, but you're wrong.

00:18:35.698 --> 00:18:37.400
It's not.

00:18:37.434 --> 00:18:39.872
That's not what
Grampa taught me...

00:18:39.905 --> 00:18:41.543
Or what Master Avan
taught me...

00:18:41.576 --> 00:18:45.015
Or what Dad taught me
about justice...

00:18:45.049 --> 00:18:48.221
You're wrong about
every single thing!

00:18:51.563 --> 00:18:52.664
All: Dai!

00:18:59.979 --> 00:19:01.248
Mytsvearn [thought]:
They stand...

00:19:01.282 --> 00:19:04.454
After they were on
the verge of death?!

00:19:05.691 --> 00:19:07.327
As you wish.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.397
Such a persuasive soul,

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:11.034
one that gives
your weak friends

00:19:11.068 --> 00:19:14.207
the strength to
somehow defy me.

00:19:14.241 --> 00:19:17.413
But your soul will lead
them to their demise.

00:19:17.446 --> 00:19:19.852
If you wish to change my mind,

00:19:19.885 --> 00:19:23.894
you'll have to reveal just
how powerful you really are.

00:19:23.927 --> 00:19:25.630
Then here we go...

00:19:27.066 --> 00:19:29.839
This is all of my power!

00:19:29.872 --> 00:19:32.778
Vearn: Kaiser Phoenix!

00:19:32.811 --> 00:19:37.854
Avan Strash!

00:19:39.525 --> 00:19:41.394
C'mon! Work!

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:43.633
Too slow.

00:19:46.472 --> 00:19:47.741
Dai!

00:20:02.972 --> 00:20:04.340
Mystvearn: King Vearn!

00:20:04.374 --> 00:20:07.748
Vearn [thought]: He was able
to counter my second attack.

00:20:07.781 --> 00:20:09.250
And not only that,

00:20:09.284 --> 00:20:13.425
but his force overpowered
my Kaiser Phoenix.

00:20:14.294 --> 00:20:15.964
Very well!

00:20:18.368 --> 00:20:19.671
Boom spells?!

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:45.624
Whoa! It's... like
a storm of Boom spells!

00:20:45.657 --> 00:20:48.630
Vearn's using weaker spells
and fighting with numbers!

00:20:48.663 --> 00:20:52.704
Each one of these is as
destructive as a Kaboom spell.

00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:55.910
No, Dai!

00:21:01.722 --> 00:21:04.762
Mystvearn: King Vearn,
perhaps it's time to put an end

00:21:04.796 --> 00:21:08.603
to these games and let
us all join the battle.

00:21:09.337 --> 00:21:13.212
Vearn: What? Ridiculous.

00:21:13.245 --> 00:21:15.884
You actually believe
the boy will survive

00:21:15.918 --> 00:21:17.921
this kind of attack?

00:21:20.259 --> 00:21:21.929
Dai, no!

00:21:23.098 --> 00:21:26.471
[roaring]

00:21:34.087 --> 00:21:35.322
Now...

00:21:35.356 --> 00:21:38.897
Take this!

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:41.000
[overpowered roar]

00:21:42.236 --> 00:21:44.307
Mystvearn: King Vearn!

00:23:37.835 --> 00:23:40.339
Narrator: After surviving
Dai's Avan Strash,

00:23:40.373 --> 00:23:42.644
King Vearn summons
a legendary weapon,

00:23:42.678 --> 00:23:45.315
then delivers a
counterstrike powerful enough

00:23:45.349 --> 00:23:47.754
to shake the heavens
and the earth...

00:23:47.787 --> 00:23:50.492
And once he's driven
back his adversaries,

00:23:50.526 --> 00:23:53.566
the Dark King unleashes
his finishing blow.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.704
In the face of
almost certain doom,

00:23:55.737 --> 00:23:58.142
is there any hope
for Dai and his friends?

00:23:58.175 --> 00:23:59.512
Find out next time on

00:23:59.545 --> 00:24:01.950
