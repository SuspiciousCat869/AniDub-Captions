WEBVTT

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:52.190
Block: [roaring punch]

00:02:02.211 --> 00:02:04.616
Enough messing around!

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:14.536
Crocodine: Howl, Vortex Axe!

00:02:15.672 --> 00:02:17.274
Take this!

00:02:20.213 --> 00:02:23.386
I shall be your
opponent, young mage.

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:26.292
Well, you're going to have to
catch me first, aren't you?

00:02:34.743 --> 00:02:35.778
[snarling]

00:02:47.134 --> 00:02:49.204
[charging roar]

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.625
Hadlar: So... this is the
power of the Dragonoid...

00:03:15.658 --> 00:03:18.797
A truly worthy
opponent, aren't you?!

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.192
You still don't seem
to understand...

00:03:33.226 --> 00:03:35.564
It's over!

00:03:58.611 --> 00:04:03.153
Baran: A Dragonoid will not stop
until its opponent is destroyed.

00:04:03.186 --> 00:04:06.927
This is the ultimate
battle form of my kind.

00:04:09.231 --> 00:04:11.536
And now that I have
unleashed this power...

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.072
you don't stand a chance -

00:04:13.106 --> 00:04:15.811
no matter how
hard you might try!

00:04:26.132 --> 00:04:27.602
C-Curse you!

00:04:34.782 --> 00:04:39.191
[pained howl]

00:04:39.224 --> 00:04:41.396
Now you can't use that sword.

00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:44.468
Difficult to cast
spells, too, isn't it?

00:04:46.272 --> 00:04:49.278
Hadlar [thought]:
He's strong... Too strong!

00:04:49.311 --> 00:04:51.549
The Superior Being
body was created

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:53.687
based on the
Dragonoid's abilities.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.330
It should rival or even
surpass his might...

00:04:58.363 --> 00:05:03.439
So, why? Why can't
I do anything to him?!

00:05:06.012 --> 00:05:07.347
Mystvearn: Such power...

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.654
Even Hadlar is
no match for him.

00:05:10.688 --> 00:05:15.898
It seems that our friend has
disturbed the hornet's nest.

00:05:15.932 --> 00:05:18.102
The Dragon Knight
is no different from

00:05:18.136 --> 00:05:20.440
any other beast in nature.

00:05:20.474 --> 00:05:22.612
They'll display
incredible strength

00:05:22.645 --> 00:05:27.622
to protect their offspring,
and punish any transgression.

00:05:27.655 --> 00:05:30.595
Baran can't control himself.

00:05:30.628 --> 00:05:34.937
I suppose... that
settles things, then.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.506
Regrettable.

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:40.380
Mystvearn: You're going
to detonate the Black Core?

00:05:40.414 --> 00:05:42.953
Hadlar already
lost this battle

00:05:42.986 --> 00:05:46.326
and I believe he has
earned some kind of mercy.

00:05:46.359 --> 00:05:48.095
Has he not?

00:05:49.967 --> 00:05:54.141
All I need to do is unleash a
finger's worth of magic power...

00:05:54.175 --> 00:05:56.680
and the Core will explode.

00:05:56.713 --> 00:06:01.189
The next move Baran
makes against Hadlar...

00:06:01.222 --> 00:06:04.796
Will be his final one.

00:06:16.853 --> 00:06:21.162
Well, it seems the Dark Lord
still has some fight left.

00:06:21.195 --> 00:06:23.534
[pained snarl]

00:06:23.567 --> 00:06:27.041
You would seriously attempt
an Ultra Combustion Slash

00:06:27.074 --> 00:06:28.744
with a broken arm?

00:06:29.278 --> 00:06:30.981
It's futile!

00:06:34.021 --> 00:06:35.758
Well, futile or otherwise...

00:06:35.792 --> 00:06:41.435
Accepting my fate without trying
would be worse than this pain.

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:46.145
I will not back down.
Not after all I've done!

00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:48.951
Very well.

00:06:50.454 --> 00:06:52.490
I'm waiting, Hadlar.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.197
[roaring]

00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:14.702
[growling]

00:07:18.209 --> 00:07:20.915
[roaring]

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:23.486
[snarling]

00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:58.991
Hadlar: [grim chuckle]

00:07:59.024 --> 00:08:02.999
How disappointing
it is, Baran, truly...

00:08:03.032 --> 00:08:10.714
To come so far, yet still
wind... up... short....

00:08:14.054 --> 00:08:19.064
Vearn: Your final effort
was most impressive, Hadlar.

00:08:19.097 --> 00:08:20.734
But never fear;

00:08:20.768 --> 00:08:22.638
Just as you hoped...

00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:24.609
your demise can
still bring about

00:08:24.643 --> 00:08:27.548
the Dragon Knight's
annihilation.

00:08:27.581 --> 00:08:31.388
Your moment of glory arrives.

00:08:31.421 --> 00:08:34.896
Now reveal your
fury, Black Core!

00:08:43.346 --> 00:08:44.715
What's this?

00:08:47.622 --> 00:08:48.890
But, how?!

00:08:48.924 --> 00:08:52.899
I cast my magic power,
and yet nothing happened...

00:08:52.932 --> 00:08:55.437
Why didn't the Core detonate?

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:56.973
Baran: [chuckling]

00:08:58.008 --> 00:09:01.248
You underestimated
me, Dark King.

00:09:02.619 --> 00:09:03.854
Why do you think...

00:09:03.887 --> 00:09:09.064
that I accepted Hadlar's
final challenge, you fool?

00:09:09.098 --> 00:09:13.907
This moment - I was waiting
for this very moment.

00:09:16.278 --> 00:09:20.621
So I could contain the Core's
blast with my Draconic Aura!

00:09:24.362 --> 00:09:26.432
Very clever, Baran.

00:09:26.466 --> 00:09:30.574
So, he was prepared
for the explosion.

00:09:33.446 --> 00:09:34.314
What...

00:09:35.183 --> 00:09:36.218
What...

00:09:36.252 --> 00:09:38.624
What is that thing?

00:09:38.657 --> 00:09:42.063
And what was it doing
inside my body?!

00:09:42.097 --> 00:09:47.207
You are a Darkling, you must
have heard of these before.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.411
This is a Black Core.

00:09:49.444 --> 00:09:51.281
A Black Core?!

00:09:52.183 --> 00:09:55.390
Hadlar: That's...
That's impossible!

00:09:55.423 --> 00:09:58.362
a cursed legendary
explosive...

00:09:58.396 --> 00:10:01.435
It was inside
of me all this time?

00:10:01.468 --> 00:10:04.475
Who... Who would
do such a thing?!

00:10:04.509 --> 00:10:06.279
Who do you think it was?

00:10:06.312 --> 00:10:07.749
It was your king.

00:10:07.782 --> 00:10:10.788
The one who promised
you the surface world,

00:10:10.821 --> 00:10:13.661
all the while
intending to destroy it-

00:10:13.694 --> 00:10:15.965
and you in the process!

00:10:15.998 --> 00:10:17.969
K-King Vearn?

00:10:18.002 --> 00:10:19.170
I see...

00:10:19.204 --> 00:10:22.243
So, all this time you and
Dai were holding back because

00:10:22.277 --> 00:10:26.385
you feared you might indirectly
set off the Black Core...

00:10:27.822 --> 00:10:33.165
What happened... What happened
to having a fair fight?

00:10:33.199 --> 00:10:38.677
There was no way you could
have won under such conditions.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:42.919
I sacrificed my own body...

00:10:42.952 --> 00:10:47.093
I sacrificed my life
to have this battle!

00:10:49.031 --> 00:10:52.136
[howling]

00:10:55.143 --> 00:10:56.846
Mystvearn: Hadlar...

00:10:59.051 --> 00:11:02.859
Killvearn: Oh, my.
How very pathetic.

00:11:02.892 --> 00:11:05.765
Vearn: It can't be
helped, Killvearn.

00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:08.571
I didn't expect the
power of Baran's Aura

00:11:08.604 --> 00:11:12.611
to be this strong
in the Dragonoid form.

00:11:12.645 --> 00:11:16.285
And yet he managed to
repel my Magic Power.

00:11:16.319 --> 00:11:18.222
How very impressive.

00:11:18.256 --> 00:11:20.193
But as the Core's creator,

00:11:20.226 --> 00:11:23.533
all I need to do is get
near enough to the device

00:11:23.567 --> 00:11:26.806
to trigger the
detonation sequence.

00:11:31.048 --> 00:11:32.250
So be it.

00:11:32.283 --> 00:11:37.294
I shall go there myself and
erase them along with the Core.

00:11:37.327 --> 00:11:40.768
Killvearn: But, my king...
if you go out there,

00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:43.774
you're going to make
the rest of us look bad!

00:11:43.807 --> 00:11:45.811
Right, Myst?

00:11:45.844 --> 00:11:47.615
[amused chuckle]

00:11:47.648 --> 00:11:49.719
And there he goes.

00:11:53.492 --> 00:11:56.599
Baran - wh-what are you doing?

00:11:56.632 --> 00:11:58.135
Removing the Core
from your body

00:11:58.169 --> 00:12:01.008
before Vearn can
make his next move!

00:12:02.745 --> 00:12:06.051
[agonized howl]

00:12:10.393 --> 00:12:11.796
Hadlar: Mystvearn?

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.802
He's only here
to try and stop me.

00:12:15.571 --> 00:12:17.340
Is it true?

00:12:17.374 --> 00:12:22.116
D-Do you... Do you
share King Vearn's will?!

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:25.223
Have you come
to cast me aside...

00:12:25.256 --> 00:12:27.460
Like some broken tool?

00:12:27.494 --> 00:12:33.139
Is that it? Was I nothing
more than a pawn to you, too?!

00:12:33.172 --> 00:12:38.516
Mystvearn: Hadlar, we both know
the answer to that question.

00:12:46.231 --> 00:12:51.041
Mystvearn: The Dark King's plan
takes precedence above all.

00:12:53.345 --> 00:12:57.788
Hadlar: I see.
So... this is the end.

00:12:57.821 --> 00:13:00.894
Well, Mystvearn, it seems
you're already too late.

00:13:00.928 --> 00:13:05.036
Even with you here I cannot
be defeated in battle!

00:13:05.069 --> 00:13:06.907
Mystvearn: Don't be so sure.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.879
I need not dirty
my hands with combat-

00:13:09.912 --> 00:13:13.887
I can erase the
both of you without it.

00:13:17.728 --> 00:13:20.901
W-What - what kind
of power could this be?!

00:13:20.934 --> 00:13:25.076
Mystvearn: King Vearn,
do I have your permission?

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:28.315
Indeed. Do it, Mystvearn.

00:14:16.478 --> 00:14:17.849
Th-That's...

00:14:17.882 --> 00:14:20.219
Mystvearn's true form?!

00:14:22.257 --> 00:14:23.425
Yes, now...

00:14:23.459 --> 00:14:26.999
Time to embrace the
annihilation of the Black Core!

00:14:32.645 --> 00:14:34.949
The device is fully active!

00:14:34.982 --> 00:14:36.619
Baran [thought]: Impossible!

00:14:36.653 --> 00:14:41.529
My Dragonoid Draconic Aura
should repel any Magic Power.

00:14:41.562 --> 00:14:44.100
It would take the presence
of King Vearn himself,

00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:46.672
at close proximity,
to do that...

00:14:48.676 --> 00:14:50.279
Then that means-

00:14:50.313 --> 00:14:51.616
Detonate!

00:15:00.668 --> 00:15:01.936
It's going to explode!

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:03.941
It makes no sense at all.

00:15:03.974 --> 00:15:06.513
Only the Magic Power
of a Black Core's creator

00:15:06.546 --> 00:15:08.382
should be able to detonate it.

00:15:08.415 --> 00:15:12.524
Mystvearn, does this mean
that your real form...?

00:15:12.558 --> 00:15:14.862
There is no point asking.

00:15:14.895 --> 00:15:18.904
In mere moments,
you will both be erased.

00:15:18.937 --> 00:15:21.241
Now that you have
seen this face,

00:15:21.275 --> 00:15:24.515
you cannot be
allowed to survive.

00:15:42.384 --> 00:15:45.456
This is more than
just an earthquake.

00:15:45.489 --> 00:15:46.660
Something nearby -

00:15:46.693 --> 00:15:49.532
something nearby is
causing this disturbance!

00:15:49.565 --> 00:15:51.301
Turn and face me, you fool!

00:15:56.412 --> 00:15:58.348
Hyunckel: Everybody,
we need to regroup!

00:15:58.382 --> 00:16:00.620
Something's happening
to the Field of Death.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.302
What the...?

00:16:10.974 --> 00:16:13.513
[troubled scream]

00:16:13.547 --> 00:16:15.784
What is it?! Merle?

00:16:15.818 --> 00:16:18.222
A dark force
swallowing everything...

00:16:18.255 --> 00:16:20.560
Everyone... will vanish.

00:16:20.594 --> 00:16:22.197
Even Popp.

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:23.567
No...

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.635
Amy: Calm down.

00:16:24.668 --> 00:16:28.041
Merle: [crying]

00:16:31.682 --> 00:16:34.420
Could that be what's
causing this earthquake?

00:16:34.889 --> 00:16:35.657
Princess!

00:16:35.691 --> 00:16:36.659
Emergency!

00:16:37.862 --> 00:16:40.901
Something strange is happening
around the Field of Death.

00:16:40.934 --> 00:16:44.241
It's like...
an active volcano!

00:16:44.274 --> 00:16:45.042
What?!

00:16:45.075 --> 00:16:47.480
The others must be
in grave danger.

00:16:51.255 --> 00:16:52.290
Princess, please...

00:16:52.323 --> 00:16:54.695
We must go save the Heroes!

00:16:55.597 --> 00:16:56.599
Flora: Enough.

00:16:58.369 --> 00:16:59.370
W-Who...?

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.016
I know you!

00:17:05.049 --> 00:17:07.454
I... I can't
believe you're here!

00:17:07.487 --> 00:17:10.727
Flora: We must leave this
place immediately. Hurry.

00:17:11.428 --> 00:17:12.396
All: Right!

00:17:18.877 --> 00:17:22.751
Baran [thought]: It's no good.
The explosion is inevitable.

00:17:25.023 --> 00:17:28.429
Goodbye, Hadlar and Baran.

00:17:28.462 --> 00:17:32.337
The king himself
respected both of you.

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:36.646
And now your names shall
be etched upon my heart...

00:17:36.679 --> 00:17:38.650
forevermore.

00:17:43.793 --> 00:17:45.530
[pained groan]

00:18:08.676 --> 00:18:10.112
[startled cries]

00:18:21.435 --> 00:18:23.038
Killvearn: This shaking...

00:18:23.072 --> 00:18:26.211
Is the palace finally
going to reveal itself?

00:18:26.244 --> 00:18:28.281
That's correct.

00:18:36.264 --> 00:18:38.035
Killvearn: Covering up already?

00:18:38.068 --> 00:18:41.107
Your true face is so
much more interesting.

00:18:41.141 --> 00:18:43.379
Yeah - let's get
another look at 'ya!

00:18:43.412 --> 00:18:47.487
Mystvearn's power should not be
exposed without good reason.

00:18:47.521 --> 00:18:50.293
Mystvearn: As you
command, my Dark King.

00:18:50.326 --> 00:18:54.669
You've done well indeed.
Good, Mystvearn.

00:18:54.702 --> 00:18:57.808
It's done. All of it.

00:18:57.842 --> 00:19:00.146
The Hero and his
band of traitors

00:19:00.179 --> 00:19:02.818
have all been
erased at last...

00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:05.323
along with the Field of Death.

00:19:05.356 --> 00:19:07.661
Killvearn: So,
we're all that remains.

00:19:07.694 --> 00:19:14.975
Right. Just us three...
and my mighty palace, as well.

00:19:15.008 --> 00:19:19.985
It is finally time for the
surface world to be erased.

00:19:20.019 --> 00:19:22.591
[victorious cackle]

00:19:22.625 --> 00:19:27.066
I'm removing the barrier
around our new base now.

00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:30.206
The rock that obscured
it is falling away,

00:19:30.239 --> 00:19:32.444
revealing our vessel.

00:19:32.477 --> 00:19:35.315
But I sense something amiss.

00:19:37.119 --> 00:19:39.558
Vearn: After the
Black Core's explosion,

00:19:39.592 --> 00:19:42.330
everything aside
from our stronghold

00:19:42.363 --> 00:19:45.436
should have been reduced
to nothing but ash.

00:19:47.975 --> 00:19:49.745
Could it be?

00:19:49.778 --> 00:19:53.085
Mystvearn, have the
Heyedras search the area

00:19:53.118 --> 00:19:55.390
for any possible survivors.

00:19:55.423 --> 00:19:56.725
Mystvearn: Yes, sire.

00:20:14.595 --> 00:20:15.462
[gasping]

00:20:15.496 --> 00:20:18.435
Heyedra: Survivors!
Survivors spotted!

00:20:18.468 --> 00:20:20.741
Four of them on the left wing.

00:20:20.774 --> 00:20:23.178
The Disciples of Avan.

00:20:23.212 --> 00:20:26.920
Mystvearn: They survived?
In that explosion?

00:20:26.953 --> 00:20:28.255
[chuckling]

00:20:28.288 --> 00:20:32.631
My, my - how very
fortunate they all must feel.

00:20:32.665 --> 00:20:34.434
Hyunckel: I can't
believe we made it.

00:20:34.467 --> 00:20:36.705
That explosion
was unbelievable.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.510
Maam: Who saved us?

00:20:38.543 --> 00:20:40.747
Popp: Probably
Crocodine, right?

00:20:40.781 --> 00:20:42.651
I mean, who else has
the brute strength

00:20:42.684 --> 00:20:45.524
to save us all by
burying us alive?

00:20:45.557 --> 00:20:50.099
Stop complaining.
The point is, we're still alive.

00:20:50.133 --> 00:20:54.441
I figured that going underground
would shield us from the blast.

00:20:54.474 --> 00:20:58.783
So I dug a hole that was
big enough to hide all of us.

00:20:58.816 --> 00:20:59.952
Good thinking-

00:20:59.985 --> 00:21:02.558
I don't think we could have
survived that, otherwise.

00:21:02.591 --> 00:21:05.430
It seems like the
Royal Guard are gone.

00:21:05.463 --> 00:21:08.870
We must be the only
ones who actually made it.

00:21:09.806 --> 00:21:10.774
[awkward chuckling]

00:21:10.807 --> 00:21:12.210
Well, good call!

00:21:12.243 --> 00:21:13.278
Yeah, too late.

00:21:15.016 --> 00:21:17.220
But, uh... where are we?

00:21:17.253 --> 00:21:19.424
It doesn't look
like the Field of Death.

00:21:19.457 --> 00:21:22.463
My guess - we're on
top of Vearn Palace.

00:21:22.496 --> 00:21:24.467
The blast destroyed the Field,

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.072
and exposed what
was hidden underground.

00:21:27.106 --> 00:21:30.514
Well, then... that structure
over there must be...

00:21:30.547 --> 00:21:33.553
Hyunckel: It must be
the palace's true form.

00:21:40.901 --> 00:21:41.803
No way.

00:21:41.836 --> 00:21:43.038
Maam: Popp?

00:21:44.509 --> 00:21:47.046
Popp [thought]: You're saying
we that just flew into the sky

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.916
with Vearn Palace?!

00:21:56.699 --> 00:22:01.074
[stunned breath]

00:23:37.667 --> 00:23:39.939
Narrator: With Vearn
Palace's true from revealed

00:23:39.972 --> 00:23:42.544
after the Black Core's
devastating blast,

00:23:42.578 --> 00:23:44.949
the Disciples of
Avan search for Dai,

00:23:44.982 --> 00:23:47.621
but instead they find
the horrifying results of

00:23:47.655 --> 00:23:50.426
Hadlar and Baran's battle.

00:23:50.459 --> 00:23:52.496
And before they can
plot their next move,

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:56.572
the merciless King Vearn
makes his instead...

00:23:56.606 --> 00:23:58.308
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:58.341 --> 00:24:00.581
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:00.614 --> 00:24:03.018
"The Inherited Heart".
