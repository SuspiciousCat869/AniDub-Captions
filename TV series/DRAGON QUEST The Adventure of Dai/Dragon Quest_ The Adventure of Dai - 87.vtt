WEBVTT

00:01:54.797 --> 00:01:55.699
[impressed chuckle]

00:01:55.732 --> 00:01:57.401
Larhart: I'll wager
even I might not be

00:01:57.435 --> 00:01:59.706
a match for Hym
in his current form.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.011
Come on. Don't be
so modest, Larhart.

00:02:02.044 --> 00:02:06.118
In a one-on-one fight, you'd
still be able to take him on...

00:02:06.152 --> 00:02:07.555
But in a battle like this,

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:09.392
you have to consider
every angle -

00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:11.129
every strength and weakness.

00:02:11.162 --> 00:02:12.532
For example:

00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:15.070
you use your superior agility
to overcome your enemies,

00:02:15.103 --> 00:02:16.607
and the type
of attacks you use

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.044
are all made up
of shocks and blasts.

00:02:19.078 --> 00:02:22.284
Unlike Hym, you don't
fight with Aura skills.

00:02:22.785 --> 00:02:23.955
I understand.

00:02:23.988 --> 00:02:26.026
Although Hym may still
be inexperienced

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:27.227
when it comes to skill,

00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:30.267
the sheer force of
his Aura is undeniable...

00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:33.006
Also, it's Aura of Light
that he's wielding...

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:34.308
a power that hurts Mystvearn

00:02:34.341 --> 00:02:36.346
more than anything
we could hope for.

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.218
They're... Exact opposites.

00:02:39.251 --> 00:02:41.022
Hym: I'll be honest,
Mystvearn...

00:02:41.055 --> 00:02:42.659
I almost feel a little bad,

00:02:42.693 --> 00:02:45.030
having to knock you
around like this.

00:02:45.063 --> 00:02:48.704
The Dark Army was crawling with
all sorts of annoying types,

00:02:48.738 --> 00:02:51.376
but out of all of them,
you were the only one

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.915
who seemed to truly
respect Lord Hadlar.

00:02:53.948 --> 00:02:55.350
Mystvearn: Hadlar?

00:02:56.218 --> 00:02:58.156
It's impossible.

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:00.460
Are you telling me
that your newfound life

00:03:00.493 --> 00:03:03.433
and Aura were a
dying gift from him?!

00:03:03.466 --> 00:03:05.270
Seems like that's the case.

00:03:05.304 --> 00:03:06.573
Don't get me wrong,

00:03:06.607 --> 00:03:09.279
it's not as if I have a
logical way to explain it...

00:03:09.312 --> 00:03:11.850
Hym: But something
inside tells me it's so.

00:03:11.884 --> 00:03:13.086
I don't believe it.

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:16.125
Is Hym saying it was Hadlar's
will that brought him back?

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:17.762
Could it really be?

00:03:21.937 --> 00:03:25.276
Something tells me
you're right, Little Hym!

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.347
Miracles don't
happen to bad guys.

00:03:27.381 --> 00:03:29.252
You aren't in the
Dark Army anymore -

00:03:29.285 --> 00:03:31.723
you're one of the
Beast King Commandos.

00:03:32.491 --> 00:03:34.596
So, that's it -that's all!

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.701
Hym: Thanks for
believing in me, Captain.

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:55.337
Mystvearn:
Don't make me laugh!

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.840
A mere puppet like you,

00:03:56.874 --> 00:03:59.478
claiming to be the
reincarnation of Hadlar?!

00:03:59.512 --> 00:04:02.719
You've forgotten your place,
you arrogant little worm!

00:04:02.752 --> 00:04:05.691
Now I, Mystvearn,
shall remind you of it.

00:04:05.724 --> 00:04:08.429
It's time to
reduce you to scrap!

00:04:08.462 --> 00:04:11.870
You can try, but don't count
on it working out for you.

00:04:11.903 --> 00:04:15.744
Because damaging my Orichalcum
form like that is a feat...

00:04:15.778 --> 00:04:19.284
that only one person in the
world is able to accomplish!

00:04:19.318 --> 00:04:21.222
Who... Me?

00:04:21.256 --> 00:04:23.927
[roaring]

00:04:26.031 --> 00:04:26.967
Mystvearn: [struggling grunts]

00:04:35.718 --> 00:04:39.491
[roaring]

00:04:41.897 --> 00:04:42.899
Whoa...

00:04:44.636 --> 00:04:47.041
That's the stuff, Little Hym!

00:04:47.074 --> 00:04:48.109
Mystvearn [thought]: Curses!

00:04:48.142 --> 00:04:49.913
This pawn... is
stronger than I thought.

00:04:49.946 --> 00:04:51.983
At this rate, my usual
tactics won't do.

00:04:52.017 --> 00:04:54.689
It's regrettable, but
I have no other choice.

00:04:54.723 --> 00:04:57.361
I'll have to unleash
my true power.

00:04:57.394 --> 00:04:58.965
Mystvearn: Your Majesty?

00:04:58.998 --> 00:04:59.832
King Vearn!

00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:01.937
My Dark King,
do you not hear me?

00:05:01.971 --> 00:05:05.010
Forgive my intrusion -
the matter is urgent...

00:05:05.043 --> 00:05:08.450
Mystvearn [thought]: No, no...
Something must be wrong.

00:05:08.483 --> 00:05:09.886
He may be fighting Dai,

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.458
but I don't believe that King
Vearn could be so distracted

00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:14.762
that he wouldn't answer
when I call to him.

00:05:14.796 --> 00:05:15.598
Unless...

00:05:15.632 --> 00:05:17.535
Is it... Is it
really possible that

00:05:17.568 --> 00:05:20.774
Dai is mounting such
a tremendous assault?

00:05:39.378 --> 00:05:40.949
Leona [thought]:
What's wrong, Dai? Get him!

00:05:40.982 --> 00:05:43.386
Now's your chance.
Why are you hesitating?

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.923
Dai [thought]:
I don't get it.

00:05:44.956 --> 00:05:48.998
Is he... Is the Dark
King Vearn really this weak?

00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:52.037
Or maybe Leona's Kaglimmer
spell is impacting him...

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.908
No, it can't be.

00:05:53.941 --> 00:05:56.179
It barely had any
affect on Hadlar,

00:05:56.212 --> 00:05:58.283
and Vearn's way more powerful.

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:00.219
There's no way it
can be weakening him.

00:06:00.253 --> 00:06:04.028
Then... Could I actually have
gotten that much stronger?

00:06:04.061 --> 00:06:05.932
Vearn: So how does it feel?

00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:09.806
To finally overwhelm an enemy
who once made a fool of you.

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:13.714
You look confused.
I thought you'd be satisfied.

00:06:13.747 --> 00:06:15.984
Perhaps your strength
has grown so far

00:06:16.018 --> 00:06:18.924
beyond your imagination that
you're beginning to question

00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.564
whether it's really
me you're facing.

00:06:21.597 --> 00:06:23.300
But mark these words:

00:06:23.333 --> 00:06:26.573
very soon, it will make
you feel euphoric.

00:06:26.606 --> 00:06:28.142
Feel... euphoric?

00:06:28.175 --> 00:06:30.079
To drown in one's own power...

00:06:30.113 --> 00:06:32.652
It sates a thirst that even
the most exquisite wine

00:06:32.685 --> 00:06:35.791
in all the realms
fails to acknowledge.

00:06:36.993 --> 00:06:39.465
Not that a child like
you would understand

00:06:39.498 --> 00:06:42.103
the joys of a fine wine.

00:06:49.418 --> 00:06:50.788
[snarling]

00:06:50.821 --> 00:06:53.894
Watch out! He's on
the offensive!

00:06:53.927 --> 00:06:56.767
Mystvearn: Without permission
to unveil the supreme power,

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.473
I must fight this fool with what
strength I have available...

00:07:00.508 --> 00:07:04.381
And I will pour all of
my Dark Aura into this fist.

00:07:04.414 --> 00:07:05.919
Here it comes...

00:07:05.952 --> 00:07:08.489
Dark Aura Ultimate Hand!

00:07:11.196 --> 00:07:12.231
Hym!

00:07:12.264 --> 00:07:14.836
Look out! That's
concentrated Dark Aura -

00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:18.911
it could be devastating.
He must be out of options!

00:07:18.944 --> 00:07:21.817
Hey! Whatever you do,
don't let that Aura touch you.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.352
You're gonna have to dodge it!

00:07:23.386 --> 00:07:24.889
Mystvearn: Dodging is
out of the question...

00:07:24.922 --> 00:07:27.962
Let's put your Orichalcum
to the test, shall we?

00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:31.336
That idiot! He's gonna
take it head-on!

00:07:31.369 --> 00:07:33.540
Little Hym - are you crazy?!

00:07:34.208 --> 00:07:35.277
Wait!

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.114
Hyunckel: Look at his stance.

00:07:37.148 --> 00:07:38.884
Mystvearn: [roaring]

00:07:38.918 --> 00:07:40.788
[roaring]

00:07:53.212 --> 00:07:54.582
[shocked gasp]

00:07:54.615 --> 00:07:56.085
[stunned gasps]

00:07:56.118 --> 00:07:57.021
Mystvearn: Just as I thought.

00:07:57.054 --> 00:07:58.924
There's more than
one person who's able to

00:07:58.957 --> 00:08:02.030
destroy your Orichalcum
form after all.

00:08:03.266 --> 00:08:05.470
Mystvearn: Now, shatter!

00:08:05.504 --> 00:08:06.940
I don't think so.

00:08:06.973 --> 00:08:10.748
You see, even a mere pawn
can make a sacrifice.

00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:12.552
If you want to
hear the truth...

00:08:12.585 --> 00:08:14.656
The only reason you
got that arm is because

00:08:14.689 --> 00:08:16.893
I let you take it, Mystvearn.

00:08:16.927 --> 00:08:19.999
It lets me get close enough
to catch you off-guard.

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:23.273
That's right,
my final option...

00:08:23.306 --> 00:08:25.043
is a surprise left-hook.

00:08:25.076 --> 00:08:27.414
Aura Knuckle!

00:08:27.447 --> 00:08:29.653
Mystvearn [thought]:
It... It can't be...

00:08:29.686 --> 00:08:33.259
How could this insignificant
puppet defeat me?!

00:08:33.292 --> 00:08:34.962
Impossible!

00:08:37.468 --> 00:08:38.236
All right!

00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:40.574
Little Hym! Way to go!

00:08:46.085 --> 00:08:49.593
Sometimes, it takes great damage
to inflict a greater one.

00:08:49.626 --> 00:08:50.862
And besides,
it's nothing that

00:08:50.895 --> 00:08:53.667
a high-level Healing-type
spell can't fix.

00:08:53.701 --> 00:08:55.571
Now, to finish him off...

00:08:55.604 --> 00:08:57.007
I don't think
that's necessary.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.545
After that blow, he's not
about to fight back.

00:08:59.579 --> 00:09:02.484
What's important now...
is getting his mask off.

00:09:02.518 --> 00:09:03.887
Hym: His mask?

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.928
Mystvearn [thought]: K-King
Vearn, please answer me...

00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:10.968
[chuckling]

00:09:14.408 --> 00:09:15.577
Leona [thought]:
This is bad...

00:09:15.611 --> 00:09:18.316
It's like Dai's starting
to lose his initiative.

00:09:18.349 --> 00:09:21.789
Vearn's strange confidence
must be throwing him off.

00:09:21.823 --> 00:09:23.493
Dai [thought]:
I'm sure of it now.

00:09:23.527 --> 00:09:24.929
It's not some kind of trick.

00:09:24.963 --> 00:09:28.068
He's definitely fighting
at full strength here.

00:09:28.102 --> 00:09:30.206
But if this is
really all he's got

00:09:30.239 --> 00:09:31.408
when he's not holding back...

00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:35.818
Then why is he so confident?
It doesn't make any sense.

00:09:35.851 --> 00:09:38.456
Leona: Come on, Dai.
Just keep fighting!

00:09:38.489 --> 00:09:39.992
You can win this
through inertia alone,

00:09:40.026 --> 00:09:42.297
but only if you
don't let up on him.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.301
Keep moving.
Stay aggressive!

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.679
Leona, He's about
to attack - get down!

00:09:51.816 --> 00:09:54.355
Vearn: The power you wield
is irresistible, Dai.

00:09:54.388 --> 00:09:57.728
I shall lift the mystic veil
and show you its potential...

00:09:57.762 --> 00:10:00.132
while I still
have the chance!

00:10:02.204 --> 00:10:03.941
Leona: Is that a fiery bird?

00:10:03.974 --> 00:10:06.079
Kaiser Phoenix!

00:10:06.112 --> 00:10:07.615
Dai [thought]: I've
seen this before...

00:10:07.648 --> 00:10:09.819
I can stop it with
an Avan Strash!

00:10:11.222 --> 00:10:12.591
[roaring]

00:10:12.625 --> 00:10:14.261
Both: He's using
two attacks?!

00:10:29.258 --> 00:10:31.095
Uh... What happened?

00:10:31.128 --> 00:10:33.600
It looked like they
collided, but if they did,

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:35.838
shouldn't this place
be nothing but rubble?

00:10:37.642 --> 00:10:39.344
Wait, where did Dai go?!

00:10:39.979 --> 00:10:40.848
Dai...

00:10:44.589 --> 00:10:48.029
So the mighty...
Dragon Knight prevails.

00:10:48.062 --> 00:10:50.902
Even when I offered
my greatest attack...

00:10:50.935 --> 00:10:53.105
I couldn't defeat him.

00:11:01.189 --> 00:11:02.691
Yes, Dai!

00:11:24.703 --> 00:11:26.405
Mystvearn [thought]:
King Vearn...

00:11:26.438 --> 00:11:29.612
What's so important about
getting his mask off, huh?

00:11:29.645 --> 00:11:30.681
You should know.

00:11:30.715 --> 00:11:32.050
Mystvearn's true identity,

00:11:32.084 --> 00:11:35.122
has been shrouded
in mystery for ages.

00:11:35.156 --> 00:11:37.628
And I believe the reason
for that is somehow...

00:11:37.661 --> 00:11:39.431
his identity must
be directly linked

00:11:39.464 --> 00:11:40.934
with the Dark King's secret...

00:11:40.967 --> 00:11:42.671
Let's see what
he's been hiding.

00:11:42.705 --> 00:11:44.241
Wait. "The Dark
King's secret"?

00:11:44.274 --> 00:11:46.379
When the Legion
Commanders used to convene,

00:11:46.412 --> 00:11:48.049
Mystvearn never spoke.

00:11:48.082 --> 00:11:50.353
I suspect the face
he hides, or his voice,

00:11:50.387 --> 00:11:53.961
depending on who hears it, is
of great importance to Vearn.

00:11:53.994 --> 00:11:56.933
And if I'm right, once we
remove that raiment,

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:59.170
we'll know exactly why that is.

00:11:59.605 --> 00:12:00.741
Are you serious?

00:12:00.774 --> 00:12:01.610
Just a hunch.

00:12:01.643 --> 00:12:03.012
When I was in the Dark Army,

00:12:03.045 --> 00:12:05.717
I became one of Vearn's
favorite servants.

00:12:05.751 --> 00:12:08.489
I imagine, out of the
Six Legion Commanders,

00:12:08.524 --> 00:12:10.193
It was me who
spent the most time

00:12:10.226 --> 00:12:12.798
actually in the
Dark King's presence...

00:12:12.831 --> 00:12:14.535
And Mystvearn was my teacher.

00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:17.140
I spent hours with him
learning to wield Dark Aura.

00:12:17.173 --> 00:12:19.311
Point is, I was
close to both of them.

00:12:19.345 --> 00:12:21.717
If I can get a look at
Mystvearn's true form,

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.788
perhaps I'll see the
reason he's kept it hidden

00:12:23.821 --> 00:12:25.156
for all of these years.

00:12:25.189 --> 00:12:28.029
Then, if we can get
that information to Dai

00:12:28.062 --> 00:12:29.699
while he's fighting Vearn...

00:12:29.733 --> 00:12:31.135
I get it.

00:12:31.168 --> 00:12:33.641
It could give him an advantage
and help him win the battle.

00:12:33.674 --> 00:12:35.410
It's all the same to me.

00:12:35.443 --> 00:12:38.684
Either way, this guy's
not putting up a fight...

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:41.255
We can finish him off
whenever we want.

00:12:41.288 --> 00:12:43.560
If Hyunckel wants to see
what's under that raiment,

00:12:43.593 --> 00:12:44.929
it's no big deal.

00:12:45.697 --> 00:12:47.333
Crocodine [thought]:
"Raiment"...

00:12:47.802 --> 00:12:48.937
Hym: Here we go...

00:12:51.643 --> 00:12:53.379
No, wait!

00:12:53.913 --> 00:12:55.083
Just a minute.

00:12:55.116 --> 00:12:56.820
Popp: Take it easy, Big Guy.

00:12:56.853 --> 00:12:58.924
What's wrong? What are
you yelling about?

00:12:58.957 --> 00:13:01.930
I... I think unveiling what
he's hiding under that cowl...

00:13:01.963 --> 00:13:04.067
could be incredibly dangerous.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.271
What? What do you
mean, "dangerous"?

00:13:06.305 --> 00:13:07.240
All I know is this:

00:13:07.273 --> 00:13:10.614
"Do not remove
Mystvearn's Shadow Raiment."

00:13:10.648 --> 00:13:14.589
Right before we came here from
the battlefield in Loroi Valley,

00:13:14.622 --> 00:13:16.258
Lon Beruk told me that,

00:13:16.292 --> 00:13:19.932
and he asked me to make sure the
message found its way to you.

00:13:19.965 --> 00:13:21.903
Crocodine: His...
Shadow Raiment?

00:13:21.936 --> 00:13:23.306
Lon Beruk: Yes, that's right.

00:13:23.339 --> 00:13:24.743
Crocodine: What is that?

00:13:24.776 --> 00:13:26.746
You mean his clothing?

00:13:26.779 --> 00:13:29.151
The mask he wears
to hide his face?

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:31.523
Lon Beruk: Perhaps
both, or maybe neither.

00:13:31.556 --> 00:13:34.563
I can only express what
I sensed in vague terms...

00:13:34.596 --> 00:13:36.298
and yet I have no doubt.

00:13:36.332 --> 00:13:39.371
There's something at work that's
suppressing the true nature...

00:13:39.404 --> 00:13:40.775
of his power.

00:13:40.808 --> 00:13:41.943
There's no other explanation

00:13:41.976 --> 00:13:43.947
for how the two of us
were able to fight,

00:13:43.981 --> 00:13:47.253
and stay evenly matched,
for as long as we did.

00:13:47.286 --> 00:13:50.293
Just as I wasn't using the
full extent of my strength,

00:13:50.326 --> 00:13:51.563
neither was he.

00:13:51.597 --> 00:13:55.035
The battle only went on because
both of us were holding back.

00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:57.274
Crocodine [thought]: It looked
fairly ferocious to me...

00:13:57.307 --> 00:14:00.013
But at a certain point
I came to realize...

00:14:00.046 --> 00:14:02.351
even if he wanted to
fight at full strength,

00:14:02.384 --> 00:14:03.486
Mystvearn can't do it.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.458
Clearly for a different
reason than mine...

00:14:06.491 --> 00:14:08.964
There's more to the
specter than he lets on.

00:14:08.997 --> 00:14:10.534
His parting words are proof:

00:14:10.567 --> 00:14:14.976
"I imagine, if you fought me
using your full strength,

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:18.048
our battle wouldn't have
lasted nearly as long."

00:14:18.081 --> 00:14:19.952
"'course, as
I'm sure you aware,

00:14:19.986 --> 00:14:22.057
the same could
be said... for me."

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.994
Then... what
you're saying is,

00:14:24.027 --> 00:14:26.465
Mystvearn is still
hiding his true power?

00:14:26.498 --> 00:14:27.802
You sure he wasn't bluffing?

00:14:27.835 --> 00:14:29.806
No. There's something there.

00:14:29.839 --> 00:14:31.075
Don't do anything that would

00:14:31.108 --> 00:14:33.178
force him to fight
with all his strength...

00:14:33.212 --> 00:14:35.116
Lon Beruk: There's no
telling what will happen

00:14:35.149 --> 00:14:37.187
when he removes that raiment.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:41.461
Lon Beruk explained it as some
kind of energetic restraint

00:14:41.495 --> 00:14:44.034
suppressing Mystvearn's
unfathomable power...

00:14:44.067 --> 00:14:46.873
And whatever that is, it's
called his "Shadow Raiment".

00:14:46.906 --> 00:14:49.512
So you really think
that this thing is his mask?

00:14:49.545 --> 00:14:50.648
I'm not sure...

00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:52.885
But when Hym used the
word "raiment" to describe it,

00:14:52.918 --> 00:14:54.088
I remembered...

00:14:54.121 --> 00:14:55.991
Is it worth the risk?

00:14:59.064 --> 00:15:01.301
No... it sounds to me
like Lon Beruk meant,

00:15:01.335 --> 00:15:03.439
if we get a chance
to defeat Mystvearn,

00:15:03.472 --> 00:15:05.544
then we should take it
before he gets desperate,

00:15:05.577 --> 00:15:08.148
and decides it's time
to reveal this true power.

00:15:08.182 --> 00:15:09.150
Yes.

00:15:09.184 --> 00:15:11.322
Larhart: These two make
a good point, Hyunckel.

00:15:11.355 --> 00:15:12.423
Mystvearn...

00:15:12.457 --> 00:15:15.129
has certainly proven himself
to be unfathomable...

00:15:15.162 --> 00:15:17.133
And Lon Beruk is
the most highly regarded

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:18.903
craftsman in all
of the Underworld.

00:15:18.937 --> 00:15:20.439
We'd do well to
heed his wisdom.

00:15:20.473 --> 00:15:23.146
Isn't it possible that he
could be far closer to knowing

00:15:23.179 --> 00:15:25.651
the Dark King and
Mystvearn's secret than you?

00:15:25.684 --> 00:15:27.722
Hyunckel [thought]:
I suppose it is possible...

00:15:27.755 --> 00:15:29.058
In any case, he's right.

00:15:29.091 --> 00:15:31.161
We can't ignore a
warning from Lon Beruk.

00:15:31.195 --> 00:15:33.332
Well? What are
we going with here?

00:15:33.365 --> 00:15:35.604
Do you want me to show
you this guy's face,

00:15:35.637 --> 00:15:38.342
or would you rather
just me finish him off?

00:15:39.879 --> 00:15:41.481
Hyunckel, come on...

00:15:42.651 --> 00:15:44.021
That must be Dai.

00:15:44.054 --> 00:15:46.158
The final battle's
already started...

00:15:46.192 --> 00:15:48.262
We'd better get
this over with.

00:15:54.174 --> 00:15:56.044
Okay. Forget the mask.

00:15:56.078 --> 00:15:57.915
Finish him so
we can catch up.

00:15:57.948 --> 00:15:59.886
But what about his
true identity?

00:15:59.919 --> 00:16:01.890
If Lon Beruk says
leave the mask on,

00:16:01.923 --> 00:16:03.527
then who am I to argue?

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.566
Besides, we should get moving.
Dai could use our help.

00:16:06.599 --> 00:16:08.570
Some questions are
better left unanswered.

00:16:08.603 --> 00:16:11.408
Let's rid the world of
the last of the Dark Army.

00:16:11.441 --> 00:16:12.578
Sure thing.

00:16:16.218 --> 00:16:18.857
Hyunckel [thought]: Yes. That's
the right choice. It has to be.

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:20.259
Even though Mystvearn's
secret will be

00:16:20.292 --> 00:16:23.734
obliterated along with him,
this must be done...

00:16:23.767 --> 00:16:25.402
for the sake of our victory.

00:16:25.436 --> 00:16:27.875
The desire to learn the
truth may only stem from

00:16:27.908 --> 00:16:29.545
my personal feelings, anyway.

00:16:29.579 --> 00:16:33.720
After all, he was my teacher,
even if the study was in evil.

00:16:33.753 --> 00:16:36.024
Right now, victory comes first.

00:16:36.058 --> 00:16:38.029
Hym: This is
farewell, Mystvearn...

00:16:38.062 --> 00:16:40.199
Hope you rest in peace!

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:42.772
Mystvearn: Your Majesty...
King Vearn...

00:16:42.805 --> 00:16:44.440
Forgive me!

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:51.088
Vearn: [pained snarl]

00:16:51.121 --> 00:16:53.192
Leona [thought]: I've never
seen so much force.

00:16:53.225 --> 00:16:55.864
That was definitely
Vearn's deciding attack...

00:16:55.898 --> 00:16:57.400
And Dai managed
to survive it.

00:16:57.434 --> 00:16:59.271
He even landed
a counterstrike.

00:16:59.304 --> 00:17:01.008
But how did he pull it off?

00:17:01.041 --> 00:17:02.310
When Vearn's
attacks collided,

00:17:02.344 --> 00:17:04.882
the flash made it too
bright to see anything.

00:17:04.916 --> 00:17:06.552
Truly unbelievable.

00:17:06.585 --> 00:17:10.326
To dive headfirst into the
fire of my Kaiser Phoenix...

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:11.495
What?!

00:17:11.529 --> 00:17:14.034
Vearn: And to conceive of
such a ploy in an instant...

00:17:14.067 --> 00:17:16.739
Kaiser Phoenix!

00:17:19.912 --> 00:17:21.649
Vearn: If you blocked
my Kaiser Phoenix,

00:17:21.682 --> 00:17:24.889
my Staff of Edacity
would be free to strike.

00:17:24.922 --> 00:17:26.225
If you blocked my staff,

00:17:26.258 --> 00:17:29.364
you'd be consumed by
the Phoenix's flames.

00:17:29.398 --> 00:17:31.736
Knowing that either way
would result in damage,

00:17:31.769 --> 00:17:36.713
you decided to take your chances
and leapt into the fire.

00:17:36.746 --> 00:17:40.119
A seemingly reckless move,
but inside the Phoenix...

00:17:40.153 --> 00:17:41.856
is the only
position where one can

00:17:41.889 --> 00:17:44.495
successfully take
me by surprise.

00:17:44.529 --> 00:17:45.564
Exactly.

00:17:45.597 --> 00:17:48.603
I knew no matter what I did,
it was gonna hurt...

00:17:48.637 --> 00:17:52.176
so I chose the way where I
could at least hurt you back.

00:17:52.209 --> 00:17:53.378
[pained groan]

00:17:53.914 --> 00:17:56.151
Oh, Dai! Are you okay?!

00:17:58.255 --> 00:17:59.625
Leona [thought]:
Of course he isn't.

00:17:59.659 --> 00:18:02.832
He just got hit with the
Dark King's strongest spell.

00:18:02.865 --> 00:18:03.933
A natural result.

00:18:03.967 --> 00:18:05.603
You may have found
a way to strike me,

00:18:05.637 --> 00:18:08.576
but you still took a direct
hit from my Kaiser Phoenix.

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:10.514
Most would have been
reduced to ash...

00:18:10.547 --> 00:18:13.954
If you were unscathed,
it would scar my dignity.

00:18:13.987 --> 00:18:16.158
One more attack should
finish you off.

00:18:16.191 --> 00:18:18.830
You... won't get the chance!

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:22.003
Now it's... my turn...
to a-attack...

00:18:22.037 --> 00:18:23.239
Before that blow I landed

00:18:23.272 --> 00:18:26.211
on your shoulder
starts regenerating...

00:18:26.245 --> 00:18:28.683
I'll have to use
my deciding attack.

00:18:28.717 --> 00:18:33.092
This time, you're the one
who'll feel "a natural result."

00:18:33.125 --> 00:18:34.729
In fact, I'm sure that

00:18:34.762 --> 00:18:36.999
if I've thought this
next one out right...

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:41.141
It'll be the attack that ends
you, once and for all, Vearn.

00:18:47.153 --> 00:18:48.623
[laughing]

00:18:48.656 --> 00:18:49.859
Interesting!

00:18:49.892 --> 00:18:52.430
Go ahead.
Let's see this attack.

00:18:55.737 --> 00:18:56.740
Huh?!

00:18:56.773 --> 00:18:58.308
Doruora?

00:19:02.083 --> 00:19:03.486
Stubborn fool.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.027
Have you already forgotten that
Doruora has no effect on me?

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:09.865
Dai: You're wrong.
This time, it will work!

00:19:11.168 --> 00:19:13.272
Dai: I've seen the might
of my Dad's attack

00:19:13.306 --> 00:19:15.376
and I know what it can do.

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:18.983
No defense is strong enough
to stop a Doruora spell.

00:19:19.017 --> 00:19:23.059
Once it's been conjured, there
are only two ways to survive it.

00:19:23.092 --> 00:19:26.298
Withstand it with
brute force, or dodge.

00:19:26.332 --> 00:19:27.500
When you reappeared

00:19:27.535 --> 00:19:29.538
after I thought I'd hit
you with the first one,

00:19:29.571 --> 00:19:32.611
your clothes hadn't
taken any damage at all.

00:19:33.412 --> 00:19:34.882
It's a powerful ability.

00:19:34.915 --> 00:19:38.689
But Dark King or not, you
wouldn't get away unscathed.

00:19:38.723 --> 00:19:41.361
Having said that, if you
dodged it with a Zoom spell,

00:19:41.395 --> 00:19:44.702
you wouldn't have emerged from
under that rubble, either.

00:19:44.735 --> 00:19:48.042
Dai: Which means the secret
to how you survived it...

00:19:48.075 --> 00:19:50.013
can only be one thing...

00:19:50.046 --> 00:19:51.849
the Staff of Edacity!

00:19:53.218 --> 00:19:54.588
Vearn: Are you certain?

00:19:54.621 --> 00:19:57.761
Not a bad hypothesis,
but what if you're wrong?

00:19:57.794 --> 00:20:02.036
Casting a Doruora drains
massive amounts Magic Power...

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.140
I doubt you can do
it more than twice.

00:20:04.173 --> 00:20:06.077
Your first attempt
already failed...

00:20:06.111 --> 00:20:08.215
So who's to say I
won't counter again?

00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:10.654
What will you do when
you've spent everything?

00:20:10.687 --> 00:20:12.725
That's a risk that
I'll have to take.

00:20:12.758 --> 00:20:15.798
Once I do this, I'll have
no more Magic Power.

00:20:15.831 --> 00:20:17.366
I know that.

00:20:19.404 --> 00:20:22.343
But I also know that
you're not gonna counter!

00:20:26.018 --> 00:20:28.790
Take this... Doruora!

00:20:39.344 --> 00:20:41.549
Vearn stopped the
Doruora with his staff!

00:20:41.583 --> 00:20:42.483
I knew it!

00:20:43.285 --> 00:20:44.655
Vearn: You're
very clever, Dai.

00:20:44.689 --> 00:20:47.426
The blade in my staff is able
to fire a burst of energy

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.064
that can block any spell -

00:20:49.097 --> 00:20:51.569
even one as fearsome as this.

00:20:51.603 --> 00:20:53.840
Just as you hypothesized,

00:20:53.874 --> 00:20:57.213
I survived your first
Doruora by deflecting

00:20:57.246 --> 00:21:00.385
its effects using my staff.

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:10.974
All I have to do is
endure this, and I win!

00:21:13.112 --> 00:21:15.216
Vearn: There. Got you!

00:21:15.249 --> 00:21:16.685
Leona, now!

00:21:17.788 --> 00:21:18.857
No!

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:20.894
Silver Feather!

00:21:23.099 --> 00:21:24.200
Vearn: [pained yell]

00:21:24.234 --> 00:21:26.371
Here comes another!

00:21:29.946 --> 00:21:32.416
[roaring]

00:21:33.285 --> 00:21:35.156
[snarling]

00:21:35.189 --> 00:21:38.663
roaring]

00:21:39.297 --> 00:21:42.069
[pained scream]

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:49.985
[defeated roar]

00:23:37.635 --> 00:23:40.506
Narrator: The Dark King Vearn
vanishes in a brilliant flash,

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.312
consumed by the light
of Dai's second Doruora.

00:23:43.345 --> 00:23:44.748
Soon the attack's aftershock

00:23:44.781 --> 00:23:46.552
rumbles through
the White Garden,

00:23:46.585 --> 00:23:48.923
where the others prepare
to regroup with their leader.

00:23:48.956 --> 00:23:52.396
But before they can move out,
Mystvearn rises once again,

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:54.635
reaching for the raiment
that conceals his face

00:23:54.668 --> 00:23:56.939
along with the devastating
fury of his true power...

00:23:56.972 --> 00:23:58.843
So make sure not to
miss the next episode of

00:23:58.876 --> 00:24:01.215
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:01.248 --> 00:24:02.984
"The Shadow Raiment."
