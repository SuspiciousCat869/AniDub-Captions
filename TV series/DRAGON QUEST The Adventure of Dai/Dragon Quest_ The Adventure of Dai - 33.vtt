WEBVTT

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:52.357
[seething]

00:01:53.092 --> 00:01:53.861
Hadlar: Zaboera!

00:01:53.894 --> 00:01:55.163
Yes, my Lord?

00:01:55.197 --> 00:01:58.369
I want you to summon the
Mystic Legion, immediately.

00:01:58.403 --> 00:02:00.608
I'll call upon
my elite guards.

00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:03.113
We'll gather all of our
remaining forces

00:02:03.146 --> 00:02:04.749
and launch a
mass offensive.

00:02:04.783 --> 00:02:07.922
The boy and his pathetic
allies will not survive.

00:02:07.956 --> 00:02:09.860
W-wait just a minute,
Lord Hadlar!

00:02:09.893 --> 00:02:12.866
That plan has already
failed us one time before.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.307
Dai's party will not be defeated
by numbers alone, understand?

00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:19.278
A carefully-planned
assassination

00:02:19.311 --> 00:02:21.650
is our best option right now!

00:02:22.586 --> 00:02:25.992
Allow old Zaboera
to handle this one.

00:02:26.025 --> 00:02:27.128
You see, my friend...

00:02:27.161 --> 00:02:29.666
the victor is not
simply the strongest;

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.645
a victor is one who survives to
the end by any means necessary.

00:02:35.678 --> 00:02:36.847
[frustrated growl]

00:02:53.413 --> 00:02:54.983
Crocodine: Let her sleep.

00:02:55.017 --> 00:02:57.454
She's been using
Fullheal nonstop

00:02:57.487 --> 00:02:59.793
to tend to everyone's wounds.

00:03:02.164 --> 00:03:04.803
It was a very difficult fight.

00:03:04.836 --> 00:03:06.907
We're lucky we all survived.

00:03:09.078 --> 00:03:10.280
Crocodine: What's wrong?

00:03:10.313 --> 00:03:12.885
The fight isn't quite
over yet, isn't it?

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:16.358
Baran may be gone,
but the Dark Army remains.

00:03:17.461 --> 00:03:20.869
If we're attacked now,
we won't have a chance.

00:03:20.902 --> 00:03:22.204
I'll stand guard.

00:03:23.072 --> 00:03:25.144
You're in no
condition for that.

00:03:25.177 --> 00:03:26.412
Popp: Dai's right.

00:03:26.445 --> 00:03:28.917
The half-dead ones should
probably take it easy.

00:03:29.285 --> 00:03:30.453
Dai: Popp!

00:03:30.487 --> 00:03:32.725
Why don't you just leave
guard duty to me, gang?

00:03:32.758 --> 00:03:33.660
Are you crazy?

00:03:33.694 --> 00:03:35.632
The rest of us
might be half-dead,

00:03:35.665 --> 00:03:37.702
but you're the one who
was completely dead.

00:03:37.736 --> 00:03:40.675
You need the rest more
than all of us combined!

00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:41.744
That's just it.

00:03:41.777 --> 00:03:45.618
I'm not sure why, but now
that I think about it,

00:03:45.652 --> 00:03:48.190
I feel better than
I did before I died.

00:03:48.223 --> 00:03:49.660
Save your bravado.

00:03:49.693 --> 00:03:50.661
Popp: Yeah?

00:03:50.695 --> 00:03:54.502
Well, see for yourself;
is this just "bravado?"

00:03:59.211 --> 00:04:00.548
That was a Sizz spell!

00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:02.886
That level of focus
in your magic power

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.057
should be impossible.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.760
See? It's weird, but...

00:04:06.793 --> 00:04:09.833
For some reason I'm
in tip-top shape today.

00:04:09.866 --> 00:04:11.035
Fine, then.

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.440
It looks like you're in the
best state out of all of us.

00:04:13.473 --> 00:04:15.845
Don't you worry about
a thing, everybody.

00:04:15.878 --> 00:04:18.984
If things get ugly, I'll be
sure to give you a shout.

00:04:21.657 --> 00:04:23.761
Hyunckel: It's been said...
that drinking the blood

00:04:23.795 --> 00:04:27.435
of a legendary dragon
can grant immortality.

00:04:27.468 --> 00:04:28.705
If that's actually true,

00:04:28.738 --> 00:04:30.641
then Baran may have
something to do with

00:04:30.674 --> 00:04:33.313
all of Popp's
newfound strength.

00:04:33.346 --> 00:04:34.516
Dai: You think?

00:04:35.684 --> 00:04:38.356
Then if you drink my blood,
will you all get stronger?

00:04:39.158 --> 00:04:40.661
[laughing]

00:04:40.695 --> 00:04:44.603
Baran said your blood is
closer to that of a human's.

00:04:44.636 --> 00:04:46.740
I just thought that
if I had that power,

00:04:46.774 --> 00:04:49.646
I could make it so all
my friends are immortal.

00:04:52.217 --> 00:04:53.688
Don't you worry, Dai.

00:04:53.721 --> 00:04:57.028
We're not going anywhere,
anytime soon.

00:04:57.061 --> 00:04:58.997
And that includes Popp.

00:05:03.239 --> 00:05:04.843
Popp: Maybe it was bravado,

00:05:04.876 --> 00:05:08.482
but this is the least I
can do if I want to be useful.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.324
My big last stand
was a total failure,

00:05:12.358 --> 00:05:15.064
and I end up getting
saved by my enemy.

00:05:15.097 --> 00:05:16.967
Talk about embarrassing.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.971
But I won't miss twice.

00:05:20.975 --> 00:05:23.847
No, Gomechan, I'm not going
to cast Megante again.

00:05:23.881 --> 00:05:28.323
I just meant that I won't
mess up like I did last time.

00:05:28.356 --> 00:05:30.962
Merle [thought]: I knew
something wasn't right...

00:05:30.995 --> 00:05:33.433
I'm going to survive
until the end, buddy.

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:35.504
C'mon, didn't I tell you that?

00:05:37.174 --> 00:05:39.244
What do you mean
you don't remember?

00:05:39.278 --> 00:05:41.816
Gomechan, you really
are a mystery.

00:05:42.852 --> 00:05:45.591
Maybe you're some
kind of guardian angel.

00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:48.931
Merle [thought]: Please, Popp.
Don't push yourself too hard.

00:05:51.435 --> 00:05:54.208
Popp: Who's there?
Show yourself.

00:05:54.241 --> 00:05:56.947
Maam: Things sound rough.
You need a hand?

00:05:57.882 --> 00:05:59.151
Th-That voice...

00:06:03.727 --> 00:06:04.596
Popp: Maam!

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.906
I-Is it... really you?

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.075
[laughing]

00:06:11.108 --> 00:06:13.881
C'mon, have you forgotten
your friend's face already?

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:15.618
Of course I haven't!

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.423
Merle [thought]:
So, that's Maam.

00:06:18.456 --> 00:06:21.429
Another one of
the Disciples of Avan.

00:06:21.462 --> 00:06:24.067
Popp looks so
happy to see her.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.707
Merle [thought]:
But, wait a sec...

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.209
What about your
martial-arts training?

00:06:28.243 --> 00:06:29.779
So, are you done, or what?

00:06:29.813 --> 00:06:30.581
Huh?

00:06:30.614 --> 00:06:32.819
I bet you were
top of the class!

00:06:32.852 --> 00:06:33.821
Oh, right! That...

00:06:33.854 --> 00:06:35.959
The teacher wasn't
all that great, really.

00:06:35.992 --> 00:06:39.766
And then I got so
worried about you guys.

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:43.674
Popp [thought]: But... Maam
never gives up on anything...

00:06:43.707 --> 00:06:45.210
Merle [thought]:
I don't know why,

00:06:45.243 --> 00:06:47.949
but I'm getting
a strange feeling.

00:06:47.983 --> 00:06:50.721
There's something
sinister about her.

00:06:52.926 --> 00:06:56.198
Merle [thought]: What am
I saying? Am I just jealous?

00:06:58.003 --> 00:06:59.105
Maam: What's wrong?

00:06:59.138 --> 00:07:01.109
Nothing! Just forget it.

00:07:01.142 --> 00:07:04.749
Everyone's going to be so
relieved that you're back!

00:07:04.783 --> 00:07:06.720
Popp: They're in
for a real surprise.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:09.826
Huh?

00:07:10.326 --> 00:07:11.730
Slow down, Popp.

00:07:11.763 --> 00:07:12.865
They're probably all asleep

00:07:12.898 --> 00:07:15.203
and exhausted from
fighting, right?

00:07:15.236 --> 00:07:17.007
We really shouldn't wake them.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.048
Besides, I'd like to stay
out here a little longer.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.931
Popp [thought]:
W-what's that... sweet smell?

00:07:28.964 --> 00:07:30.501
I feel woozy.

00:07:36.846 --> 00:07:38.316
Maam: Popp...

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:41.055
Popp [thought]:
I-I can't believe it.

00:07:41.088 --> 00:07:43.560
Is... Maam, actually...

00:07:44.194 --> 00:07:45.798
Oh, Popp...

00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:47.935
M-Maam...

00:07:49.137 --> 00:07:50.507
Sweet dreams!

00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:53.780
Ow! What do you
think you're doing?!

00:07:53.814 --> 00:07:56.987
I made a new friend and I
thought I'd bring them along.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:57.522
Popp: What?!

00:07:57.556 --> 00:07:59.191
You've already met.

00:08:00.627 --> 00:08:02.097
Popp: H-Hadlar?

00:08:02.599 --> 00:08:04.134
Wait, then you're...

00:08:04.167 --> 00:08:06.539
[evil chuckle]

00:08:09.411 --> 00:08:10.748
Popp: I've heard of you!

00:08:10.782 --> 00:08:13.386
I'm Mystic Bishop Zaboera.

00:08:13.419 --> 00:08:15.825
You seemed a little
on edge, so I borrowed

00:08:15.858 --> 00:08:18.964
your friend's likeness
with a little Morph spell.

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:21.936
I understand you're
quite fond her.

00:08:23.406 --> 00:08:25.109
Y-You dirty...

00:08:28.016 --> 00:08:29.819
Hadlar: So, it worked.

00:08:29.853 --> 00:08:30.855
Yes.

00:08:30.888 --> 00:08:31.856
[smug chuckle]

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.095
Popp [thought]:
I can't move.

00:08:34.128 --> 00:08:36.533
What did you do to me?

00:08:38.035 --> 00:08:40.306
Zaboera: Let me
explain, young mage...

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.948
My body is filled with hundreds
of different poisons, you see...

00:08:43.981 --> 00:08:46.586
So I used my claws
to inject you with

00:08:46.619 --> 00:08:50.226
the most potent neurotoxin
I had at my disposal.

00:08:51.462 --> 00:08:52.731
Help me...

00:08:54.067 --> 00:08:56.740
Zaboera: No one is
going to hear you.

00:08:57.441 --> 00:08:58.644
Zaboera: Besides...

00:08:58.677 --> 00:09:01.014
thanks to the Dark Incense
I've been diffusing,

00:09:01.048 --> 00:09:02.952
all of your friends
are in a slumber

00:09:02.985 --> 00:09:06.660
deeper than
the deepest ocean.

00:09:06.693 --> 00:09:08.764
The boy and his allies
are now unable to

00:09:08.797 --> 00:09:11.168
resist any attack,
Lord Hadlar.

00:09:11.201 --> 00:09:12.170
Hadlar: Good.

00:09:13.708 --> 00:09:15.878
Zaboera: I didn't
expect this one to resist

00:09:15.912 --> 00:09:18.884
the Dark Incense, though.

00:09:18.918 --> 00:09:21.957
Perhaps he's gained some
kind of special power.

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.862
That's just the
Disciples of Avan for you.

00:09:24.896 --> 00:09:27.601
They gain they're power
when you're not watching

00:09:27.635 --> 00:09:30.306
and then bare their fangs.

00:09:30.339 --> 00:09:34.348
I'll have to take care
of this one here and now.

00:09:34.381 --> 00:09:36.185
Popp: I'm disappointed, Hadlar.

00:09:36.218 --> 00:09:37.287
What?!

00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:40.761
You were always cruel,
but you never played dirty.

00:09:40.795 --> 00:09:44.268
At least the last time
we fought, you still had...

00:09:44.301 --> 00:09:47.641
the dignity of a commander
on the battlefield.

00:09:47.675 --> 00:09:49.211
But now...

00:09:49.244 --> 00:09:50.413
You're just resorting to

00:09:50.447 --> 00:09:53.587
the dirty tricks
of this old gremlin?

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.824
Oh, how the mighty
have fallen.

00:09:55.858 --> 00:09:58.864
You shut your mouth!

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:01.704
In battle, there is no
method that I won't use.

00:10:01.737 --> 00:10:03.740
Victory is the only option!

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:08.717
You know, Crocodine once
said the same thing...

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:13.092
But in the end,
he realized the truth.

00:10:13.126 --> 00:10:15.429
He realized that...

00:10:15.463 --> 00:10:17.333
There are more
important things

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:20.674
than winning or
losing a fight!

00:10:20.707 --> 00:10:24.114
You think you can lecture
the great Lord Hadlar?

00:10:24.147 --> 00:10:27.087
It'll be my honor to
finish you off myself!

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.360
A little bit more poison
should do the job...

00:10:30.393 --> 00:10:32.063
[evil snickering]

00:10:32.698 --> 00:10:34.769
Time to die!

00:10:36.539 --> 00:10:37.107
[pained shrieking]

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.108
What?!

00:10:39.812 --> 00:10:43.219
Get your filthy
little paws off of him.

00:10:44.388 --> 00:10:45.858
Who are you?

00:10:46.459 --> 00:10:50.166
M-Mentor... Matoriv.

00:11:04.696 --> 00:11:05.931
Who are you?

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:09.104
M-Mentor... Matoriv.

00:11:10.106 --> 00:11:13.146
You moron, you let
them deceive you.

00:11:13.179 --> 00:11:16.151
You need to work harder
on your perception.

00:11:16.185 --> 00:11:17.321
Popp: Sorry, Mentor.

00:11:17.354 --> 00:11:18.758
Never forget this;

00:11:18.791 --> 00:11:21.228
the Mage must always
be the most focused

00:11:21.261 --> 00:11:23.900
and level-headed
member of their party.

00:11:23.934 --> 00:11:26.371
Everybody else is
allowed to get worked up,

00:11:26.405 --> 00:11:31.248
but you need to stay cool as ice
and understand the situation.

00:11:31.282 --> 00:11:34.789
At least that was what I
did when working with Avan.

00:11:36.292 --> 00:11:38.263
Now I recognize you.

00:11:38.296 --> 00:11:41.269
You sided with Avan
and his resistance.

00:11:41.302 --> 00:11:43.573
They said that you
were the most powerful

00:11:43.606 --> 00:11:46.245
Grand Sorcerer
among the humans.

00:11:46.278 --> 00:11:50.119
Yeah, and I see you're
still a third-rate Dark Lord.

00:11:50.152 --> 00:11:51.488
How dare you?!

00:11:51.522 --> 00:11:53.125
Matoriv: You just
won't give up,

00:11:53.159 --> 00:11:55.931
so now I have to
play clean-up.

00:11:55.964 --> 00:11:59.940
On top of that, you killed
one of my only friends.

00:11:59.973 --> 00:12:03.580
He was a good guy,
as well. He really was.

00:12:03.613 --> 00:12:07.254
And he wasn't even
a third of my age.

00:12:07.287 --> 00:12:11.629
Roka... Avan...
All the good ones are gone,

00:12:11.663 --> 00:12:15.470
and crooks like you and me
just keep getting away with it.

00:12:15.504 --> 00:12:17.908
What an ugly world this is.

00:12:20.446 --> 00:12:21.983
Matoriv: So, here's the deal.

00:12:22.017 --> 00:12:23.720
I'm sending you
to the afterlife

00:12:23.754 --> 00:12:26.492
so you can apologize
to the Hero Avan!

00:12:26.526 --> 00:12:28.997
Stupid old man - you'll see!

00:12:29.031 --> 00:12:33.306
Just one spell...
And you'll be ashes!

00:12:33.339 --> 00:12:34.274
Sizzle.

00:12:39.017 --> 00:12:40.621
Squelch.

00:12:40.655 --> 00:12:42.490
Hadlar [thought]:
Two spells at once?

00:12:42.858 --> 00:12:45.030
[weak groan]

00:12:45.063 --> 00:12:46.834
Matoriv [thought]:
He's not healing right away.

00:12:46.867 --> 00:12:49.905
That poison must be
incredibly powerful.

00:12:50.941 --> 00:12:52.511
Now, let's see...

00:12:54.615 --> 00:12:56.919
How about this?!

00:12:58.155 --> 00:12:59.157
Kasizz!

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:05.069
Hadlar: It can't be...
There's no way!

00:13:06.506 --> 00:13:08.242
Kasizz!

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.999
H-How can a mere human
conjure a Kasizz spell?!

00:13:20.033 --> 00:13:22.203
That should be impossible!

00:13:22.237 --> 00:13:25.443
Did you really think you
were the only one who could?

00:13:25.476 --> 00:13:27.213
Get over yourself.

00:13:30.286 --> 00:13:31.789
Hadlar [thought]:
I'm losing...

00:13:31.823 --> 00:13:34.529
Is his Magic Power
greater than mine?!

00:13:34.562 --> 00:13:35.798
[whimpering]

00:13:35.831 --> 00:13:37.033
Hadlar: Zaboera!

00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:39.070
Hadlar: Hurry up and help me!

00:13:41.543 --> 00:13:43.581
This is for my arm!

00:13:43.614 --> 00:13:45.149
Sizzle!

00:13:57.708 --> 00:13:59.512
[sinister laugh]

00:14:04.555 --> 00:14:07.327
It's moments like these
when I wish I was younger.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.466
My body just isn't able
to keep up with the spell.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:14.809
Popp [thought]: N-No.
My mentor is in danger.

00:14:14.843 --> 00:14:18.917
At this rate everyone in
the cabin will die, too.

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:23.894
No... C'mon you guys...
Please, wake up!

00:14:23.928 --> 00:14:30.039
Crocodine! Hyunckel!
Leona! Dai... Dai!

00:14:33.981 --> 00:14:36.251
It seems like you've
reached your limit.

00:14:36.284 --> 00:14:39.625
In the end, you're the
one who'll be seeing Avan!

00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:54.054
We've done it!

00:14:54.088 --> 00:14:56.324
[victorious chuckle]

00:15:02.771 --> 00:15:04.240
[shocked gasp]

00:15:05.944 --> 00:15:07.213
Zaboera: Dai?!

00:15:10.554 --> 00:15:11.488
Yes!

00:15:11.523 --> 00:15:12.490
Dai!

00:15:12.525 --> 00:15:15.230
But, how - the boy is
supposed to be asleep!

00:15:15.263 --> 00:15:17.935
I heard Popp...
he was calling out to me!

00:15:17.968 --> 00:15:19.606
That's impossible!

00:15:19.639 --> 00:15:20.774
Now, you'll see...

00:15:20.807 --> 00:15:24.649
This is what happens when
you try and hurt my friends!

00:15:24.682 --> 00:15:26.384
Curse you, boy!

00:15:26.418 --> 00:15:29.290
Never again,
do you understand me?

00:15:29.592 --> 00:15:33.065
Sizzle!

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:40.212
[shrieking]

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:01.756
Matoriv [thought]: He focused
all his power into his fist

00:16:01.789 --> 00:16:05.496
and reflected their Sizzle
spells with one of his own.

00:16:06.566 --> 00:16:08.636
Matoriv [thought]:
Even I can't do that.

00:16:10.574 --> 00:16:11.709
Are you okay?

00:16:11.743 --> 00:16:12.678
Y-Yeah...

00:16:12.711 --> 00:16:14.080
You did it!

00:16:14.114 --> 00:16:16.385
I've never seen anything hit
with that much Heat-energy.

00:16:16.418 --> 00:16:19.023
Hadlar's gonna be
done for sure, right?

00:16:19.057 --> 00:16:22.631
I don't know about that.
He is getting stronger.

00:16:25.002 --> 00:16:28.643
I'm sorry. Once again,
you're the one saving me.

00:16:28.677 --> 00:16:29.645
But, uh...

00:16:29.679 --> 00:16:33.553
You know, I appreciated
what you said about us.

00:16:33.586 --> 00:16:36.424
You know we've always
got your back too, right?

00:16:39.398 --> 00:16:40.734
[laughing]

00:16:40.767 --> 00:16:42.638
You two are soft.

00:16:43.105 --> 00:16:44.708
What happened?

00:16:46.513 --> 00:16:47.648
Hyunckel: Th-This is...

00:16:47.681 --> 00:16:49.384
Crocodine: Unbelievable.

00:16:49.418 --> 00:16:52.992
How did we sleep through
an explosion this size?!

00:16:53.025 --> 00:16:54.896
Zaboera and Hadlar
were just here.

00:16:54.929 --> 00:16:56.767
Both: W-What?!

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.505
Zaboera: [pained groan]

00:17:02.945 --> 00:17:05.984
Thank the gods for Zoom spells.

00:17:06.018 --> 00:17:09.124
Those filthy little brats!

00:17:09.157 --> 00:17:12.698
I doubt that Hadlar
survived the blast, as well.

00:17:12.731 --> 00:17:16.438
After all the help I gave
him, he's still useless!

00:17:16.472 --> 00:17:20.079
Now I'll have to seek
favor with Mystvearn...

00:17:20.112 --> 00:17:21.114
[startled grunt]

00:17:21.148 --> 00:17:22.685
-[growling]
-Zaboera: [shrieking]

00:17:22.718 --> 00:17:24.855
L-Lord Hadlar?!

00:17:24.889 --> 00:17:28.462
Hadlar: Zaboera,
you can't betray me.

00:17:28.496 --> 00:17:31.970
Like it or not, you and
I are in the same boat.

00:17:32.003 --> 00:17:36.846
If you trying latching on to
someone else, I'll destroy you!

00:17:38.115 --> 00:17:39.317
You think I won't?

00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:41.622
I see every move
you make, my friend-

00:17:41.656 --> 00:17:45.029
even all your research on
the history of Superior Beings!

00:17:45.062 --> 00:17:46.465
What?!

00:17:46.498 --> 00:17:48.703
I think it's time for you to
share your efforts with me...

00:17:48.737 --> 00:17:49.872
But, why?!

00:17:49.905 --> 00:17:52.811
The Disciples of Avan are
growing stronger every day.

00:17:52.844 --> 00:17:54.213
Much too fast.

00:17:54.247 --> 00:17:59.659
This body King Vearn gifted
me isn't enough to keep up.

00:17:59.692 --> 00:18:02.798
I need even greater power...

00:18:02.831 --> 00:18:06.037
Power like that
Dragonoid, Baran!

00:18:06.071 --> 00:18:08.008
Hadlar: My strength
must be greater

00:18:08.041 --> 00:18:10.379
than anything
they've ever seen!

00:18:10.412 --> 00:18:14.120
The entire world will tremble!

00:18:17.326 --> 00:18:21.502
Matoriv: I see. That explains
the crest on your hand.

00:18:21.536 --> 00:18:25.510
Impressive power.
I'm alive because of you.

00:18:26.646 --> 00:18:27.681
Hyunckel: We're sorry.

00:18:27.714 --> 00:18:31.121
We fell into a trap cast
by Zaboera of all people.

00:18:31.154 --> 00:18:32.924
You shouldn't
blame yourselves.

00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:35.864
If anything I'd blame the one
who let his silly emotions

00:18:35.898 --> 00:18:37.701
cloud his judgement.

00:18:39.337 --> 00:18:41.141
[nonchalant whistling]

00:18:41.174 --> 00:18:42.410
Crocodine:
I can't believe that

00:18:42.443 --> 00:18:45.383
Hadlar went along with
one of Zaboera's schemes.

00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:47.688
He's always preferred
the brute force approach.

00:18:47.722 --> 00:18:50.293
He probably realized
he's outmatched...

00:18:50.326 --> 00:18:51.595
Now that he's learned

00:18:51.629 --> 00:18:54.033
the Hero is the son of
the legendary Dragon Knight,

00:18:54.066 --> 00:18:55.637
he's starting
to get desperate.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.276
To trust Zaboera,
he'd have to be.

00:18:58.309 --> 00:19:00.045
The Dark Army must be facing

00:19:00.079 --> 00:19:02.718
some real changes
within their ranks.

00:19:04.354 --> 00:19:05.724
Popp: Hey, Mentor,

00:19:05.757 --> 00:19:08.597
you knew something was different
about Dai, didn't you?

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:09.330
Yeah.

00:19:09.364 --> 00:19:10.466
Don't you think
you should have

00:19:10.499 --> 00:19:12.237
shared that information
a little earlier?

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.374
Also, you really
took your precious time

00:19:14.407 --> 00:19:15.910
showing up, didn't you?

00:19:18.248 --> 00:19:20.520
Matoriv: I knew that
learning the prophecy of

00:19:20.553 --> 00:19:24.460
the Dragon Knight would be
a great burden to you, Dai.

00:19:24.494 --> 00:19:27.400
There's nothing I can
do to help with that.

00:19:27.433 --> 00:19:32.878
I only know one person who
could... so I dug this up.

00:19:32.912 --> 00:19:34.581
What, some dirty old book?

00:19:36.251 --> 00:19:38.322
Popp: This mark... Is it...

00:19:38.356 --> 00:19:39.692
It's Master Avan's!

00:19:39.726 --> 00:19:43.031
Right. This is the
legendary "Book of Avan."

00:19:43.065 --> 00:19:44.433
Both: Book of Avan?!

00:19:44.467 --> 00:19:48.375
Matoriv: Avan the Hero recorded
all of his skills, spells,

00:19:48.409 --> 00:19:51.682
and the theories behind
them for future generations.

00:19:51.715 --> 00:19:54.789
It's hand-written.
It contains his entire legacy.

00:19:54.822 --> 00:19:58.195
In all of our training Master
never mentioned this before.

00:19:58.228 --> 00:20:01.468
I found it in the Library
of Carl, his homeland.

00:20:01.502 --> 00:20:05.309
I figured that perhaps you
would make better use of it.

00:20:05.342 --> 00:20:08.215
Matoriv: Check the passage
on Air-based skills.

00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:10.119
Page one-ninety-two.

00:20:10.153 --> 00:20:11.354
It has three parts.

00:20:11.387 --> 00:20:13.292
The Book of Earth
is about combat,

00:20:13.325 --> 00:20:15.229
while Sea is
about the aura's...

00:20:15.262 --> 00:20:18.569
And the Book of Air
is all about the soul.

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:20.774
Uh...

00:20:20.807 --> 00:20:23.245
"To the... and..."

00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:26.418
Leona, could you?

00:20:26.451 --> 00:20:28.589
I can't read very well.

00:20:30.425 --> 00:20:33.165
Leona: "To the
wounded and lost.

00:20:33.198 --> 00:20:36.806
Defeat is not to
fall from your wounds.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:40.547
It is when you lose yourself
after you have fallen...

00:20:40.581 --> 00:20:42.149
Avan: Be strong of heart.

00:20:42.183 --> 00:20:47.460
Calmly consider your goals and
the limits of your abilities...

00:20:47.493 --> 00:20:51.703
For we are all limited
in what we can do.

00:20:51.736 --> 00:20:55.376
When each of us does
the best that we can,

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:58.617
even when we are on the
very edge of despair,

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:02.725
the path to victory will
reveal itself in all its glory,

00:21:02.758 --> 00:21:05.664
and shine brightly
before you."

00:21:05.697 --> 00:21:10.540
Dai [thought]: It's like Master
is right here - in the room.

00:21:10.573 --> 00:21:14.582
Popp [thought]: He always
said it best, didn't he?

00:21:14.615 --> 00:21:16.552
Hyunckel [thought]: Avan...

00:21:17.855 --> 00:21:20.660
Matoriv: Anyways, I thought
you might be interested.

00:21:20.693 --> 00:21:23.332
Just take good
care of it, okay?

00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:25.537
Thank you so much, Matoriv.

00:21:26.404 --> 00:21:29.443
"The limits of our
abilities," huh?

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.553
Leona: Let's
return to Papnica.

00:21:33.586 --> 00:21:36.959
Leona: I want to do
the very best that I can.

00:21:36.993 --> 00:21:39.531
Something that benefits
the world in a way...

00:21:39.564 --> 00:21:42.203
that fighting has
yet to achieve.

00:21:42.236 --> 00:21:44.641
Something that only I can do.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.369
Dai!

00:21:58.402 --> 00:21:59.771
We're going!

00:22:00.373 --> 00:22:01.775
Dai: Okay!

00:23:37.768 --> 00:23:39.504
Narrator: After
returning to Papnica,

00:23:39.538 --> 00:23:42.276
Dai and his friends prepare
for their next battle.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:45.650
And when they learn of a martial
arts tournament in Romos,

00:23:45.683 --> 00:23:48.155
where the victor can
win a legendary item,

00:23:48.188 --> 00:23:50.827
Dai and Popp decide to compete.

00:23:50.861 --> 00:23:54.133
But, when they catch a glimpse
of the reigning champion,

00:23:54.166 --> 00:23:56.839
their astonishment knocks
them out of the ring.

00:23:56.873 --> 00:23:58.543
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:58.576 --> 00:24:01.314
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

Arts Tournament"
