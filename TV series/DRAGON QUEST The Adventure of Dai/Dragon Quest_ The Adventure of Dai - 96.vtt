WEBVTT

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.630
I can't help feeling...
satisfied, already.

00:01:54.663 --> 00:01:57.034
Velzar: Why, of course
you do, Dark King.

00:01:57.067 --> 00:01:58.904
It's only natural.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.175
[perplexed breaths]

00:02:03.146 --> 00:02:04.415
Velzar: You've
been toiling with

00:02:04.448 --> 00:02:07.254
this massive undertaking
for thousands of years...

00:02:07.287 --> 00:02:10.427
And now your efforts have
finally come to fruition.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.603
It pains me to admit it, but
you have me rather impressed.

00:02:14.636 --> 00:02:16.874
Ah, what an
unexpected surprise.

00:02:16.908 --> 00:02:18.210
The very voice of the one

00:02:18.243 --> 00:02:20.246
who once shared the
Underworld with me.

00:02:22.553 --> 00:02:25.423
True Vearn: Velzar,
King of the Abyss.

00:02:40.487 --> 00:02:44.194
Popp: Velzar? Isn't that
the dragon Baran fought?

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:48.370
True Vearn: Why,
how kind of you, Velzar.

00:02:48.403 --> 00:02:49.639
Considering our history,

00:02:49.673 --> 00:02:52.879
I wasn't expecting
any congratulations.

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.152
The rumors must be true...

00:02:56.185 --> 00:02:58.222
You really can't
leave our realm, can you?

00:02:58.256 --> 00:02:59.993
Otherwise, you'd be
here in person.

00:03:00.027 --> 00:03:01.830
Velzar: [ferocious snarl]

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:05.003
Velzar: All because
of that battle...

00:03:05.037 --> 00:03:09.278
The Dragon Knight may have
destroyed my corporeal form...

00:03:09.312 --> 00:03:11.382
But with my immortal soul,

00:03:11.415 --> 00:03:13.486
I would have eventually
grown a new one

00:03:13.521 --> 00:03:15.791
and returned to
seek vengeance.

00:03:15.825 --> 00:03:17.461
Only... sensing my defeat,

00:03:17.495 --> 00:03:19.298
the Spirits of
Celesta swept in

00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:21.570
and immediately
bound my essence...

00:03:21.603 --> 00:03:25.243
Leaving me imprisoned in
this miserable stone husk.

00:03:29.484 --> 00:03:32.625
Velzar: While these beings
possessed no combat skills,

00:03:32.658 --> 00:03:35.463
it seemed they did
not need them.

00:03:42.178 --> 00:03:43.714
Velzar: Curse them!
Curse them all...

00:03:43.747 --> 00:03:44.683
The Dragon Knight!

00:03:44.716 --> 00:03:47.254
Those meddlesome
Spirits of the Heavens!

00:03:47.288 --> 00:03:50.160
To be bested by these
"Legacies of the Gods"-

00:03:50.193 --> 00:03:52.799
it burns me with untold fury.

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:54.737
You got hasty.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.973
I'm sure you're aware,
because of that...

00:03:57.007 --> 00:03:59.847
I was able to make my
remaining moves in silence.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.950
Velzar: Haste had
nothing to do with it.

00:04:01.983 --> 00:04:05.390
I knew you intended to
destroy the Surface World.

00:04:05.423 --> 00:04:08.096
Yet I wanted to
rule it as my own.

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.566
Velzar: Had I not
been trapped,

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.437
I would have
stopped you long ago.

00:04:12.471 --> 00:04:15.443
Trapped as you may be,
your ambition remains.

00:04:15.477 --> 00:04:19.084
That's why you sent Killvearn
to carry out your bidding.

00:04:19.118 --> 00:04:20.989
Unfortunately,
the Reaper has-

00:04:21.022 --> 00:04:22.123
how shall I put this?

00:04:22.157 --> 00:04:24.161
Suffered a taste
of his own medicine.

00:04:24.194 --> 00:04:25.463
Velzar: What?!

00:04:25.497 --> 00:04:27.635
He's gone. Slain by the
Heroes of the Surface World.

00:04:27.668 --> 00:04:31.075
I'm sure you meant for him
to take me down eventually,

00:04:31.108 --> 00:04:32.678
perhaps at this exact moment.

00:04:32.712 --> 00:04:35.050
But either way,
he's failed you.

00:04:35.083 --> 00:04:36.987
[chuckling]

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.462
It appears... as though
I've won our little wager.

00:04:44.434 --> 00:04:47.842
Popp [thought]: A... A wager?

00:04:47.875 --> 00:04:49.512
This was a bet?!

00:04:50.147 --> 00:04:51.148
True Vearn: That's right.

00:04:51.182 --> 00:04:52.484
We were enemies at first,

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:54.923
warring for total dominion
of the Underworld.

00:04:54.957 --> 00:04:58.129
In time, we saw that we
shared a mutual hatred.

00:04:58.163 --> 00:05:00.300
We both despised the gods!

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:02.271
They tossed us aside...

00:05:02.304 --> 00:05:04.475
and deprived us of
the peace they so freely

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.212
gave the humans
on the Surface.

00:05:06.245 --> 00:05:08.383
Their injustice
was unforgivable.

00:05:08.416 --> 00:05:09.520
The only choice...

00:05:09.553 --> 00:05:11.256
was for one for us
to become our own god

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:12.892
and make them pay!

00:05:15.464 --> 00:05:17.736
Once we realized we
had a common enemy,

00:05:17.769 --> 00:05:18.971
we ended our feud.

00:05:19.005 --> 00:05:20.407
After centuries of combat,

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.144
we needed to move
past our quarrel.

00:05:22.177 --> 00:05:24.916
I suggested we resolve the
matter with a bet of sorts.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.622
We would each go ahead
with our own schemes.

00:05:27.655 --> 00:05:29.358
Whoever succeeded
first would win;

00:05:29.391 --> 00:05:31.429
and whoever lost would
serve the winner.

00:05:31.462 --> 00:05:32.331
[chuckling]

00:05:32.364 --> 00:05:33.501
But of course -

00:05:33.534 --> 00:05:35.437
as you can see from
Velzar's true intentions

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.141
when he sent me the Reaper -

00:05:37.174 --> 00:05:38.477
in spite of our truce, clearly,

00:05:38.511 --> 00:05:41.683
neither of us ever
fully trusted the other.

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:43.387
True Vearn: Even with
his master defeated,

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.658
Kill remained loyal,
watching and waiting

00:05:45.691 --> 00:05:48.462
for the perfect
opportunity to attack.

00:05:49.298 --> 00:05:51.468
And even in such
a hopeless state...

00:05:51.503 --> 00:05:53.272
Velzar never
gave up on his desire

00:05:53.306 --> 00:05:55.176
to rule the Surface World.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.017
Velzar: If the Reaper is really
gone, then so are my options.

00:05:59.051 --> 00:06:01.657
I have no other choice
than to admit defeat.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.030
You've defeated the current
Dragon Knight, your old rival,

00:06:05.063 --> 00:06:08.537
and now you seek to acquire
even the sun as your own.

00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:12.945
You are the most terrifying
being of all, Dark King.

00:06:13.413 --> 00:06:14.883
I appreciate that.

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:17.589
But never fear. While
this world will vanish...

00:06:17.622 --> 00:06:21.262
it doesn't have to be
so final, does it?

00:06:21.295 --> 00:06:22.798
You see, without
the Surface World,

00:06:22.832 --> 00:06:25.738
the balance of the Trio
of Worlds will topple.

00:06:25.771 --> 00:06:27.775
If you like, after it does,

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:29.979
I could always
invade Celesta next,

00:06:30.013 --> 00:06:33.654
and break that pesky seal the
spirits have used to bind you.

00:06:33.688 --> 00:06:35.658
True Vearn: Oh,
leaving so soon?

00:06:35.691 --> 00:06:37.360
Have I hurt your pride?

00:06:37.394 --> 00:06:41.369
[laughing]

00:06:41.402 --> 00:06:42.672
Popp [thought]: This
whole conversation is

00:06:42.706 --> 00:06:45.043
seriously above
our pay grade.

00:06:45.076 --> 00:06:47.014
Immortal souls...

00:06:47.047 --> 00:06:48.416
Becoming gods...

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.888
Storming the
Heavens themselves...

00:06:50.921 --> 00:06:53.493
They're on a totally
different playing field.

00:06:53.527 --> 00:06:56.533
We're like flies next
to these monsters...

00:06:57.067 --> 00:06:58.336
Velzar: So this is Dai,

00:06:58.369 --> 00:07:01.375
son of the one who
vanquished me?

00:07:01.408 --> 00:07:03.614
Look at him.
He's like a corpse.

00:07:03.647 --> 00:07:05.919
There's no life in his eyes.

00:07:05.952 --> 00:07:07.622
Considering his lineage,

00:07:07.655 --> 00:07:09.826
and that he met his
defeat at your hand,

00:07:09.859 --> 00:07:11.697
I thought he'd
be less pathetic.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.836
He isn't even half
the man his father was.

00:07:16.072 --> 00:07:18.511
Dai [thought]: D-Dad?

00:07:18.544 --> 00:07:20.982
You know, Velzar,
you're quite the sore loser.

00:07:21.015 --> 00:07:23.720
Take my word for it,
I can assure you...

00:07:23.754 --> 00:07:26.927
Dai is superior to
Baran in every way.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.133
The only quality he
lacks is bloodlust.

00:07:30.167 --> 00:07:31.503
It seemed there
were no bounds

00:07:31.537 --> 00:07:33.073
to his father's bloodlust.

00:07:33.106 --> 00:07:36.278
No opponent he faced
could ever match it.

00:07:36.312 --> 00:07:40.722
[laughing]

00:07:40.755 --> 00:07:42.592
Ah, yes, there it is.

00:07:42.625 --> 00:07:44.996
At long last,
it's finally hit me...

00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:46.900
It feels real now!

00:07:46.934 --> 00:07:48.336
True Vearn:
My ancient nemesis...

00:07:48.369 --> 00:07:52.845
The obstacle created by the
gods, along with his friends...

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:54.549
With all of you
groveling before me,

00:07:54.583 --> 00:07:56.720
nothing stands in my way.

00:07:57.722 --> 00:08:00.828
There's no question
about it; this is victory!

00:08:04.168 --> 00:08:06.973
Popp: It's... It's over...

00:08:15.524 --> 00:08:17.227
Merle: No, it isn't. Get up!

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.462
[surprised gasp]

00:08:18.496 --> 00:08:20.467
Popp: That voice...

00:08:20.501 --> 00:08:22.037
It can't be...

00:08:23.507 --> 00:08:24.643
Popp: Merle?!

00:08:24.676 --> 00:08:26.044
Merle: You can't quit.

00:08:26.078 --> 00:08:28.283
Whatever's happening there,
you mustn't lose hope, Popp.

00:08:28.316 --> 00:08:29.284
Please!

00:08:30.286 --> 00:08:32.592
But Merle, if you're alive...

00:08:32.625 --> 00:08:34.562
The others, are they...

00:08:39.038 --> 00:08:41.577
Are Queen Flora and
the others okay?

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:42.712
Merle: Yes.

00:08:42.745 --> 00:08:44.950
Everybody's safe.
I woke up just in time.

00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:48.323
We escaped right
before the explosion.

00:08:48.356 --> 00:08:49.860
Flora [thought]:
That was truly a shock.

00:08:49.893 --> 00:08:51.863
She bolted straight
up all of a sudden,

00:08:51.897 --> 00:08:55.403
screaming we were in grave
danger and needed to take cover.

00:08:55.436 --> 00:08:56.706
I don't get it.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.678
How did you know that
the Pillar was coming down?

00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:01.348
And now, how can I
even hear your voice?

00:09:01.382 --> 00:09:03.219
Did you get new
powers or something?

00:09:03.252 --> 00:09:04.388
I guess so.

00:09:04.421 --> 00:09:06.392
Even though I was
unconscious...

00:09:06.425 --> 00:09:08.429
Suddenly, I just knew.

00:09:08.462 --> 00:09:10.735
And I could feel
everything you were feeling.

00:09:10.768 --> 00:09:12.905
When your fear reached
its peak, I woke up.

00:09:12.938 --> 00:09:14.441
I wasn't sure what was coming,

00:09:14.474 --> 00:09:15.911
but I knew we
didn't have long.

00:09:15.945 --> 00:09:17.816
Popp [thought]: When Dai
was holding Vearn off

00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:20.888
with all those Zapple spells,
they got out of the way.

00:09:20.921 --> 00:09:22.792
But then where did
this crazy new ability

00:09:22.826 --> 00:09:24.696
of yours come from?

00:09:24.729 --> 00:09:26.332
It must be...

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:27.467
Well, it must be because

00:09:27.502 --> 00:09:29.739
I never stopped
thinking about you.

00:09:30.675 --> 00:09:31.843
Flora [thought]:
If you ask me,

00:09:31.877 --> 00:09:33.680
it seems like Popp
wasn't the only one

00:09:33.713 --> 00:09:35.383
who was reborn in that moment.

00:09:35.416 --> 00:09:39.058
Merle awakened her untapped
potential along with him.

00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:40.628
The heart is a miracle.

00:09:40.661 --> 00:09:43.033
We know that you're all in
a dire situation up there,

00:09:43.066 --> 00:09:45.236
and I can feel how
there doesn't seem to be

00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:46.640
a way of turning it around...

00:09:46.673 --> 00:09:47.575
But, Popp...

00:09:47.609 --> 00:09:49.311
It's not over.
Don't give up!

00:09:49.344 --> 00:09:50.514
Keep fighting.

00:09:50.547 --> 00:09:53.285
Don't lose hope until
the very, very end!

00:09:54.622 --> 00:09:56.058
But, Merle...

00:09:59.298 --> 00:10:02.905
True Vearn: Oh? It would
seem they made it to safety.

00:10:02.938 --> 00:10:06.312
But at this point they've
only delayed the inevitable.

00:10:06.345 --> 00:10:09.318
[evil chuckling]

00:10:09.351 --> 00:10:12.191
Popp: I wish you
were right, Merle.

00:10:12.224 --> 00:10:13.694
But if you could see us now,

00:10:13.727 --> 00:10:16.332
then no matter what
you say, you would know...

00:10:16.365 --> 00:10:18.169
It is over.

00:10:18.202 --> 00:10:21.008
It's... really all over.

00:10:21.041 --> 00:10:22.144
This is it...

00:10:22.177 --> 00:10:25.049
The world we live in,
is about to...

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:27.788
It's about to
vanish forever!

00:10:30.293 --> 00:10:31.863
I'm so sorry.

00:10:31.897 --> 00:10:35.103
We tried, but w-we just
weren't strong enough.

00:10:35.136 --> 00:10:38.577
There isn't...
there really isn't...

00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:40.514
There's nothing left
we can try here.

00:10:40.547 --> 00:10:42.785
We're done...

00:10:42.818 --> 00:10:45.256
You're wrong!
There is still a way!

00:11:00.286 --> 00:11:02.324
H-How is there still a way?

00:11:02.357 --> 00:11:03.927
Lon Beruk and Nova...

00:11:03.961 --> 00:11:06.566
They're on their way to try
and disable the Pillar.

00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:07.869
It's not over.

00:11:07.902 --> 00:11:09.940
Merle: Please, Popp.
You can't give up now.

00:11:09.973 --> 00:11:12.343
Lon thinks he can
shut down the Pillar?

00:11:16.786 --> 00:11:20.493
Lon Beruk: That Crack
spell completely froze it.

00:11:20.527 --> 00:11:22.899
Looks like my
theory was right.

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:24.970
Lon Beruk: While it
may run on Magic Power,

00:11:25.003 --> 00:11:27.474
a Black Core still
basically functions like

00:11:27.508 --> 00:11:28.777
a mechanical bomb.

00:11:28.811 --> 00:11:31.683
The trick is to cut its fuse
without setting it off.

00:11:31.716 --> 00:11:34.020
The core won't explode
if it can't be activated.

00:11:34.054 --> 00:11:36.292
Most spells run
the risk of igniting

00:11:36.325 --> 00:11:38.262
such a volatile substance...

00:11:38.295 --> 00:11:40.968
but a Crack spell only
freezes the surface,

00:11:41.001 --> 00:11:42.337
which is all we need.

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:43.239
Yeah. That's it!

00:11:43.273 --> 00:11:45.310
If we can freeze all
of the Black Cores

00:11:45.343 --> 00:11:47.380
before their timers go off...

00:11:49.251 --> 00:11:50.588
True Vearn: [laughing]

00:11:50.621 --> 00:11:51.823
It's Vearn.

00:11:51.857 --> 00:11:54.094
True Vearn: What
a shame, Lon Beruk.

00:11:54.127 --> 00:11:57.769
To see you help these humans
in their futile resistance...

00:11:57.802 --> 00:12:01.142
You soil your reputation
as a craftsman.

00:12:01.175 --> 00:12:05.016
And how exactly...
do you know it's futile?

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:07.454
True Vearn: Don't you see?
It's very simple.

00:12:07.487 --> 00:12:10.460
The pillars were activated
long before you arrived.

00:12:10.493 --> 00:12:12.197
It occurred simultaneously.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:14.101
If so much as one
of them detonates,

00:12:14.134 --> 00:12:15.905
a shockwave of
extreme heat will

00:12:15.938 --> 00:12:18.009
sweep across
the Surface World.

00:12:18.042 --> 00:12:21.315
The remaining Cores will go
off like dominoes in its wake.

00:12:21.348 --> 00:12:24.054
In other words, unless
you freeze all six of them

00:12:24.088 --> 00:12:26.492
before the timers
finish their countdown...

00:12:26.526 --> 00:12:29.231
you can't stop
their detonation.

00:12:29.264 --> 00:12:31.503
True Vearn: Can you
succeed at such a task

00:12:31.536 --> 00:12:32.905
in the minutes that remain?

00:12:32.939 --> 00:12:34.809
Be reasonable, Lon Beruk.

00:12:34.843 --> 00:12:37.047
Don't get involved in
this foolish struggle.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.852
If you like, I can summon
you here to Vearn Palace

00:12:39.886 --> 00:12:42.423
to watch the
fireworks by my side.

00:12:43.226 --> 00:12:44.629
I'll guarantee
your protection,

00:12:44.662 --> 00:12:46.700
and you'll get the
best view in the realm.

00:12:46.733 --> 00:12:48.603
Lon Beruk: That's
not a view I want.

00:12:48.636 --> 00:12:50.039
Not a chance.

00:12:50.072 --> 00:12:52.979
Of the several
centuries I've lived,

00:12:53.012 --> 00:12:54.883
I was the most
blessed and prosperous

00:12:54.916 --> 00:12:57.220
while I served your throne.

00:12:57.254 --> 00:12:59.825
And the wealth
wasn't bad, either.

00:12:59.859 --> 00:13:03.099
Except... I was the most
bored I've ever been.

00:13:03.132 --> 00:13:05.169
I've never experienced
such a sure and

00:13:05.202 --> 00:13:09.144
terrible feeling of going
to waste - before or since.

00:13:09.178 --> 00:13:11.415
I never want to
live that way again.

00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:15.122
Compared to that,
these few weeks I've spent

00:13:15.156 --> 00:13:17.127
fighting alongside
Dai and his friends

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.367
have been some of the most
fulfilling times of my life.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.703
While it's been brief...

00:13:21.737 --> 00:13:23.106
It's true.

00:13:23.139 --> 00:13:25.477
These days are filled with
a light, brighter...

00:13:25.511 --> 00:13:27.413
than I've ever known.

00:13:27.447 --> 00:13:31.021
I'm not the type to make
the same mistake twice.

00:13:31.054 --> 00:13:34.295
Instead, I choose to share
the fate of these humans...

00:13:34.328 --> 00:13:36.098
who I've grown fond of.

00:13:37.367 --> 00:13:38.970
Master!

00:13:43.245 --> 00:13:44.348
What insolence.

00:13:44.381 --> 00:13:45.517
I'm disappointed in you.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:48.289
You'll regret calling your
services to me a mistake...

00:13:48.322 --> 00:13:50.761
Yes, I'll have to
put an end to you and

00:13:50.794 --> 00:13:53.633
that foolish idea
this very instant.

00:14:11.569 --> 00:14:12.838
You again...

00:14:12.871 --> 00:14:14.608
What do you think
you're doing?

00:14:14.642 --> 00:14:15.811
[chuckle]

00:14:15.844 --> 00:14:17.480
Did you hear that, Dai?

00:14:17.514 --> 00:14:19.084
Now or never.

00:14:19.117 --> 00:14:21.556
Sounds like we don't have
time to be this miserable.

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:24.495
Others aren't going down
easy. So neither am I.

00:14:24.529 --> 00:14:26.967
If our chances aren't zero,
I'm not quitting.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.302
I've gotta help them!

00:14:28.336 --> 00:14:31.208
I'll do it all myself
if that's what it takes.

00:14:31.241 --> 00:14:33.780
I'll beat the clock
with my Zoom spell...

00:14:33.813 --> 00:14:36.151
and freeze the
rest of the Cores!

00:14:38.957 --> 00:14:40.661
Popp, no!

00:14:40.694 --> 00:14:42.363
True Vearn: Impetuous fool.

00:14:42.397 --> 00:14:44.268
When I dropped
the Pillar of Vearn,

00:14:44.301 --> 00:14:46.706
it vaporized the
Magic Circle of Light.

00:14:46.739 --> 00:14:49.745
And to shield Vearn Palace
from the coming explosion,

00:14:49.778 --> 00:14:52.083
I've used my
Magic Power to raise

00:14:52.116 --> 00:14:54.823
the protective
barrier once again...

00:14:54.856 --> 00:14:56.224
Which also
happens to leave you

00:14:56.258 --> 00:14:59.364
with no way of returning
to the Surface World.

00:14:59.397 --> 00:15:02.538
You still have zero
chance of stopping me.

00:15:03.706 --> 00:15:05.009
It'll work, but
we need to hurry.

00:15:05.042 --> 00:15:07.247
There are five more of
these Cores we need to freeze.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.988
I'll use my Zoom and head
to the Pillar in Ringaia!

00:15:11.021 --> 00:15:12.457
I'll go to Northwest Romos.

00:15:12.491 --> 00:15:13.727
You can consider it done.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:14.929
Wait a minute!

00:15:14.963 --> 00:15:16.699
If you're heading that
way, take us with you!

00:15:16.733 --> 00:15:17.968
That's a good idea.

00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:19.605
Drop us off at
Romos Castle on your way...

00:15:19.639 --> 00:15:21.910
Gomez and I will see if
there's anybody there...

00:15:21.943 --> 00:15:24.314
Just anybody who knows
how to conjure Zoom.

00:15:24.347 --> 00:15:26.853
We'll need someone who can
get to Western Papnica,

00:15:26.887 --> 00:15:28.255
someone for Valge Island,

00:15:28.289 --> 00:15:29.859
and someone for
Southern Orzam.

00:15:29.893 --> 00:15:33.499
Now make haste, and search as
hard as you can - understood?

00:15:33.533 --> 00:15:34.602
All: All right!

00:15:35.604 --> 00:15:36.906
Flora [thought]: I don't
like our odds, though.

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.209
We lack the time
and the manpower...

00:15:38.242 --> 00:15:40.113
What we need here
is someone who can

00:15:40.146 --> 00:15:43.786
instantly get to the
Pillars and cast Crack...

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.858
If only I could cast
a Zoom spell...

00:15:45.891 --> 00:15:48.328
Then I could save my Papnica!

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:49.765
Tell me, Merle.

00:15:49.799 --> 00:15:50.867
With your new power,

00:15:50.901 --> 00:15:52.337
is it possible to
reach out to people

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.508
around the world and
warn them of the danger?

00:15:54.542 --> 00:15:57.314
I fear that's beyond my
abilities, Your Majesty.

00:15:57.347 --> 00:16:00.320
I see. Don't be discouraged.

00:16:00.353 --> 00:16:02.490
Just being able to
communicate with Popp...

00:16:02.525 --> 00:16:05.195
is more than enough
of a miracle.

00:16:05.229 --> 00:16:07.367
Merle [thought]:
Popp, talk to me...

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.205
What's wrong? How can I help?

00:16:10.239 --> 00:16:12.878
There must be
something I can do!

00:16:12.911 --> 00:16:14.080
True Vearn: Those
remaining insects

00:16:14.114 --> 00:16:15.884
scurrying about
down there...

00:16:15.918 --> 00:16:17.486
What can they hope to do?

00:16:17.521 --> 00:16:19.925
They only have a
few minutes left...

00:16:19.959 --> 00:16:22.230
It's already far too late.

00:16:22.263 --> 00:16:24.467
Popp: Are you sure about that?

00:16:25.036 --> 00:16:26.472
Yes, Popp.

00:16:26.506 --> 00:16:27.608
Popp: [chuckling]

00:16:27.641 --> 00:16:29.512
Well, it ain't much
consolation, but at least

00:16:29.545 --> 00:16:32.818
the mighty Dark King
finally remembers my name.

00:16:32.852 --> 00:16:34.087
How d'you like that?

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.157
Guess I made an impression.

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.495
[struggling grunt]

00:16:38.529 --> 00:16:42.203
Why don't... you loathsome
humans ever give up?!

00:16:43.405 --> 00:16:44.575
Come on!

00:16:44.609 --> 00:16:46.947
Is there no one in all of Romos
who knows how to use Zoom?

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.449
There must be somebody.

00:16:48.483 --> 00:16:51.556
We need to get to Orzam
or Papnica right away!

00:16:51.589 --> 00:16:54.194
If you can help us,
step forward! Please!

00:16:54.228 --> 00:16:56.464
Nova: I-It's no use.

00:16:57.568 --> 00:16:59.203
I froze another one,

00:16:59.237 --> 00:17:02.076
but I've never been
to Orzam before.

00:17:02.109 --> 00:17:05.049
That means I'm going to
have to fly to get there.

00:17:05.584 --> 00:17:07.721
And in this condition...

00:17:08.523 --> 00:17:10.126
No way! Not now!

00:17:10.159 --> 00:17:12.063
Have I really
learned nothing...

00:17:12.097 --> 00:17:14.802
from Dai and his friends?!

00:17:14.835 --> 00:17:17.206
There are still three
Pillars left to deal with.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.547
How can I... How can
I give up now?!

00:17:22.718 --> 00:17:23.920
Nova: I'll... I'll crawl
there if I have to...

00:17:23.953 --> 00:17:26.458
Onward, to Orzam!

00:17:31.001 --> 00:17:33.405
True Vearn: For the
last time, it's futile.

00:17:33.438 --> 00:17:35.944
You can't defeat
the undefeatable.

00:17:35.978 --> 00:17:39.350
The sooner you accept that
fact, the easier this will be.

00:17:39.384 --> 00:17:42.324
Take a look at Dai.
See for yourself.

00:17:42.357 --> 00:17:46.331
Dai, huh? I wonder...

00:17:46.365 --> 00:17:49.672
How long do you imagine
his lifespan would be?

00:17:51.174 --> 00:17:52.845
He's the child...

00:17:52.878 --> 00:17:54.649
of a Dragon Knight
and a human.

00:17:54.682 --> 00:17:55.984
So maybe...

00:17:56.018 --> 00:17:57.186
Who knows?

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.290
Maybe it's the same as
the rest of us humans...

00:17:59.324 --> 00:18:01.729
Or maybe... He can live...

00:18:01.762 --> 00:18:04.134
a lot longer
than we do...

00:18:04.167 --> 00:18:06.371
What on Earth are
you talking about?

00:18:07.006 --> 00:18:08.544
Hey, Dark King.

00:18:08.577 --> 00:18:11.582
How long are you
supposed to live, anyway?

00:18:11.616 --> 00:18:15.824
Thousands of years?
Tens of thousands?

00:18:15.858 --> 00:18:18.597
Or do you just
not die at all?

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:21.001
Hearing how you and
that monster Velzar

00:18:21.035 --> 00:18:22.538
talked with each other...

00:18:22.572 --> 00:18:25.911
I'll bet you guys both
live a pretty long time.

00:18:25.944 --> 00:18:27.681
To someone who's seen eons,

00:18:27.714 --> 00:18:31.589
the lives of us humans
must seem so brief -

00:18:31.622 --> 00:18:34.394
like fireworks in
the night sky.

00:18:34.428 --> 00:18:36.867
Popp: As I was listening
to Lon Beruk just now,

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.335
I remembered something.

00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:40.674
It's this really old memory...

00:18:40.707 --> 00:18:43.178
From when I was a kid...

00:18:43.212 --> 00:18:45.750
I think I might've been
five or six at the time.

00:18:45.784 --> 00:18:50.360
One night, I realized everybody
leaves this world eventually.

00:18:50.393 --> 00:18:53.132
It got me thinking,
what happens when we die?

00:18:53.165 --> 00:18:55.704
Where do we go?
Why do we have to?

00:18:55.737 --> 00:18:59.578
The more I thought about it,
the more it started scaring me.

00:18:59.612 --> 00:19:01.148
My mind kept racing.

00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:03.687
Then, the waterworks opened up.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.424
My parents rushed in
to see what was wrong.

00:19:06.458 --> 00:19:08.462
"Why does everybody
die?!" I said.

00:19:08.496 --> 00:19:11.202
"It's not fair. Why can't
we live forever?!"

00:19:11.235 --> 00:19:13.004
I couldn't stop crying.

00:19:13.038 --> 00:19:15.577
Dad had no idea
what to do with me.

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:20.352
But Mom did. She always
knows what to do...

00:19:20.386 --> 00:19:23.593
So she held me close.
Squeezed me super tight.

00:19:23.626 --> 00:19:27.466
And then, after I caught my
breath, she told me the truth.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.870
Stein: You're right, Popp.

00:19:28.904 --> 00:19:30.807
Everybody dies someday...

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.814
Everybody wants life
to go on forever, too.

00:19:33.847 --> 00:19:36.686
But the end is what
makes life so precious...

00:19:36.719 --> 00:19:39.859
It's why everyone puts all of
their might into living.

00:19:39.892 --> 00:19:41.595
So she said.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.191
Compared to a
big shot like you...

00:19:56.224 --> 00:19:57.528
living up in the clouds and

00:19:57.561 --> 00:19:59.865
playing a game of
chess with the world...

00:19:59.899 --> 00:20:03.840
th-the lives... of us humans
must seem like they...

00:20:03.873 --> 00:20:06.779
don't last for more
than an instant, right?

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.687
Popp: But that's
the whole reason...

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.392
even if it doesn't
change a thing,

00:20:13.425 --> 00:20:15.262
we will keep struggling!

00:20:15.296 --> 00:20:17.668
Because that's
just what we do.

00:20:17.701 --> 00:20:18.570
Forget "easy".

00:20:18.604 --> 00:20:20.541
We put all of our
might into living...

00:20:20.574 --> 00:20:22.443
until the very last breath!

00:20:22.477 --> 00:20:23.780
It doesn't matter
whether we've got...

00:20:23.813 --> 00:20:27.487
fifty years left or even
just five more minutes...

00:20:27.521 --> 00:20:30.392
It might only be
for an instant to you -

00:20:30.426 --> 00:20:32.798
but like a bright
flash in the sky...

00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:35.369
we'll burn as
brilliant as the sun,

00:20:35.403 --> 00:20:37.941
and fight with all
the life we've got.

00:20:37.974 --> 00:20:40.079
Popp: That's how
we humans survive.

00:20:40.112 --> 00:20:42.250
There's nothing
"futile" about it.

00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:45.156
You better get ready
to be proven wrong 'cause

00:20:45.189 --> 00:20:48.529
giving up isn't in our blood!

00:20:55.544 --> 00:20:56.912
Merle [thought]:
That's it, Popp.

00:20:56.946 --> 00:20:58.650
That's the Popp
I know and love.

00:20:58.683 --> 00:21:01.822
Stand brave, keep
fighting until the end.

00:21:01.856 --> 00:21:05.496
I am with you all the way,
just keep trying.

00:21:15.583 --> 00:21:18.556
Dai [thought]: Whenever it's
seemed like a losing battle...

00:21:18.589 --> 00:21:21.428
Whenever I've felt
truly hopeless...

00:21:21.462 --> 00:21:23.198
Whenever I convince myself

00:21:23.231 --> 00:21:26.471
that the only thing
I can do is give up...

00:21:26.506 --> 00:21:29.578
Dai: Every time, you're
there, ready to help...

00:21:29.612 --> 00:21:32.250
To give me that last push.

00:21:32.283 --> 00:21:33.686
Master Avan was right.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:37.393
It's always been you...
the one holding me up.

00:21:38.697 --> 00:21:41.669
Dai: You're the greatest
friend I've got, Popp.

00:21:41.702 --> 00:21:43.806
My best friend.

00:21:47.013 --> 00:21:49.786
Dai [thought]: I'm so
glad the two of us...

00:21:49.819 --> 00:21:51.956
got to know each other.

00:21:53.058 --> 00:21:54.360
Let's go.

00:21:57.867 --> 00:22:04.548
Both: [roaring]

00:23:37.367 --> 00:23:40.573
Narrator: The cry of Popp's soul
has put Dai back on his feet,

00:23:40.607 --> 00:23:42.043
and despite their
hopeless situation,

00:23:42.076 --> 00:23:44.848
our heroes push their exhausted
bodies past their limit,

00:23:44.882 --> 00:23:47.286
rushing the Dark King
with another assault.

00:23:47.319 --> 00:23:48.723
Perplexed by their
unyielding spirit

00:23:48.756 --> 00:23:50.259
in the face of his checkmate,

00:23:50.292 --> 00:23:52.329
Vearn's confidence
begins to waver.

00:23:52.363 --> 00:23:53.666
And at that exact moment,

00:23:53.699 --> 00:23:55.971
one of the Eye Jewels
begins to glow.

00:23:56.004 --> 00:23:57.239
Will an ally break free?

00:23:57.272 --> 00:23:58.777

the next episode of

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:00.914
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,
