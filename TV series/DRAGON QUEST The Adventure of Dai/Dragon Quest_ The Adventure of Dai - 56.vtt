WEBVTT

00:01:54.027 --> 00:01:57.602
Th-This...
This is Vearn Palace?

00:02:04.248 --> 00:02:06.587
And it was buried
underneath the Field of Death

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.889
this whole time?

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:13.634
Popp: Hey, guys!

00:02:14.402 --> 00:02:15.437
Oww...

00:02:16.105 --> 00:02:17.542
So, where are we?

00:02:17.576 --> 00:02:22.886
A big floating palace thing...
or more like a gigantic bird!

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:25.525
And we're
standing on its wing.

00:02:25.558 --> 00:02:27.929
I've never seen
anything like it before.

00:02:27.963 --> 00:02:29.265
No way...

00:02:29.298 --> 00:02:31.203
I really don't think
a human being could

00:02:31.236 --> 00:02:32.573
make anything like this.

00:02:32.606 --> 00:02:35.110
How can something
this big be airborne?

00:02:35.144 --> 00:02:38.383
It's energized by the
Dark King's Magic Power.

00:02:38.416 --> 00:02:41.656
The entire palace
must be enchanted.

00:02:49.707 --> 00:02:51.777
Crocodine: It's made of
some kind of material

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.847
that's neither rock nor metal.

00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:57.622
It has to be attuned to
Vearn's frequency, somehow,

00:02:57.655 --> 00:03:00.327
that's what's giving
it the ability to fly.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.799
The whole place
is made out of it.

00:03:04.234 --> 00:03:05.370
Well, what now?

00:03:05.403 --> 00:03:07.340
Do we escape with
a Zoom spell?

00:03:08.944 --> 00:03:09.946
Come on!

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.315
You think we're
going to just

00:03:11.348 --> 00:03:13.152
leave Dai and his
father behind?!

00:03:13.186 --> 00:03:14.322
Fine. You're right!

00:03:14.355 --> 00:03:16.292
Just put me down.

00:03:16.326 --> 00:03:18.029
Hyunckel: I hope
they survived.

00:03:18.062 --> 00:03:20.066
That explosion
must have happened

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.538
during their fight
against Hadlar.

00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:27.148
Nothing else would explain
that kind of blast.

00:03:27.181 --> 00:03:28.651
King Vearn was forced.

00:03:28.684 --> 00:03:31.356
He would not have revealed
this thing, otherwise-

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:33.192
not with all of us here.

00:03:33.226 --> 00:03:35.330
Let's find Dai and Baran!

00:03:35.364 --> 00:03:37.434
Maam: If this really
is Vearn Palace,

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:40.340
the entrance they used
must be somewhere nearby.

00:03:40.374 --> 00:03:42.645
This place is gigantic...

00:03:42.678 --> 00:03:45.317
we should probably
stick together.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.724
Hey, Popp - you saw the whole
thing from above, right?

00:03:48.757 --> 00:03:51.864
There must be
something you recognize.

00:03:51.897 --> 00:03:54.102
N-No... I don't think I saw...

00:03:54.135 --> 00:03:57.407
Anything quite like that...

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.710
Everyone!

00:04:00.815 --> 00:04:01.883
Take a look.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.130
The explosion must've
happened over there.

00:04:08.163 --> 00:04:10.467
All the way at the
head of the bird, huh?

00:04:10.501 --> 00:04:13.206
And I see a staircase, too.

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.912
Hyunckel: That must be
the palace entrance-

00:04:15.945 --> 00:04:18.718
the Dark Citadel Gate.

00:04:18.751 --> 00:04:22.559
Then Popp, can your Zoom
spell get all of us over there?

00:04:22.592 --> 00:04:24.161
Sure! You know it, Big Guy.

00:04:24.194 --> 00:04:28.002
I mean, I haven't been there
before but I can see it, right?

00:04:28.035 --> 00:04:30.306
Get in real close, everybody.

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:34.014
Here goes.

00:04:39.893 --> 00:04:41.028
Hyunckel: This must be it.

00:04:41.061 --> 00:04:44.803
Must be. Now we know that
Dai and Baran are in there.

00:04:44.837 --> 00:04:46.071
Let's go!

00:05:07.582 --> 00:05:10.287
[gasps]

00:05:10.321 --> 00:05:12.625
[fearful trembling]

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:14.328
Heyedra: The survivors
have reached

00:05:14.362 --> 00:05:17.234
the palace entrance, sire.

00:05:17.267 --> 00:05:20.407
Killvearn: An attempt
to rescue the boy...

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.812
What shall we do, King Vearn?

00:05:22.845 --> 00:05:26.820
A simple welcome would
hardly suffice, yes?

00:05:26.853 --> 00:05:29.793
After all, the Disciples
are guests of honor

00:05:29.827 --> 00:05:32.497
in my grand palace.

00:05:41.415 --> 00:05:43.186
[concerned chirps]

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:44.990
Hey... Gomechan.

00:05:45.023 --> 00:05:46.594
You're hurt pretty badly, Dai.

00:05:46.627 --> 00:05:48.196
Try not to move so much.

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:49.431
Dai: Hyunckel...

00:05:49.464 --> 00:05:51.737
You're all okay.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:52.906
That's good.

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:56.747
Baran must've somehow managed
to contain the blast...

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.149
Where is he?

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.733
What's wrong, you guys?

00:06:06.766 --> 00:06:09.939
Did... Did something
happen to...

00:06:21.395 --> 00:06:22.765
[gasp]

00:06:25.871 --> 00:06:27.440
Dai: How...

00:06:29.345 --> 00:06:31.415
How did that happen to him?!

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:32.719
Dai, he...

00:06:32.752 --> 00:06:35.724
Well, take a closer
look at all the rubble.

00:06:50.053 --> 00:06:54.629
I can't be totally certain
of what happened here,

00:06:54.662 --> 00:06:57.034
but I'm confident of one thing.

00:06:57.067 --> 00:06:59.973
Baran must have used
all of his Draconic Aura

00:07:00.006 --> 00:07:03.647
to shield you from
that massive explosion.

00:07:04.415 --> 00:07:06.553
And, now...

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:11.730
[worried breaths]

00:07:26.593 --> 00:07:29.197
Dai: Hold on... Just hold on!

00:07:31.436 --> 00:07:33.205
Maam! Cast Midheal on him!

00:07:36.546 --> 00:07:37.849
Maam, please!

00:07:37.882 --> 00:07:39.686
I can't, Dai.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.322
Heal-type spells, they...

00:07:41.355 --> 00:07:46.232
they only work on creatures with
life energy still in them...

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:47.769
Your father, he...

00:07:47.802 --> 00:07:49.706
Dai: What are
you talking about?

00:07:49.739 --> 00:07:52.311
That... That's not possible!

00:07:52.344 --> 00:07:54.481
Just cast a Midheal on him!

00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:56.820
Baran: That's enough, Dai.

00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:05.571
I-Is that you... my son?

00:08:07.274 --> 00:08:11.215
I can't... see anymore.

00:08:11.248 --> 00:08:12.451
I'm right here.

00:08:12.484 --> 00:08:14.890
Tell me - what can I do?

00:08:14.923 --> 00:08:18.998
Your friends...
Are they... all safe?

00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:22.437
Yeah. They are.
They're all here, too.

00:08:22.471 --> 00:08:24.776
You saved everyone.

00:08:24.809 --> 00:08:26.345
I see.

00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:28.282
That's good to hear.

00:08:28.315 --> 00:08:33.827
But Dai, listen... there's
nothing that can be done...

00:08:35.831 --> 00:08:38.737
I am too far... beyond help.

00:08:38.771 --> 00:08:39.906
[disbelieving gasp]

00:08:41.475 --> 00:08:44.014
Baran: At the moment
of detonation...

00:09:12.539 --> 00:09:17.715
[roaring]

00:09:27.434 --> 00:09:29.404
Baran: I used Doruora and

00:09:29.438 --> 00:09:32.177
unleashed all of
my Draconic Aura

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:36.886
to suppress the scale
of the Black Core's blast.

00:09:37.622 --> 00:09:40.159
But now I have nothing left.

00:09:40.193 --> 00:09:44.301
There isn't a shred of life
energy still in my body.

00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:46.973
No healing spell can save me.

00:09:47.006 --> 00:09:48.142
You're wrong.

00:09:48.176 --> 00:09:49.846
A-A real Dragon Knight...

00:09:49.879 --> 00:09:53.052
the true Dragon Knight
is unstoppable.

00:09:53.085 --> 00:09:56.526
So no matter what,
you won't die!

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.297
You - You can't die!

00:10:02.572 --> 00:10:04.576
Baran: It's all right.

00:10:04.609 --> 00:10:08.215
You see, I am not the true
Dragon Knight after all.

00:10:09.819 --> 00:10:16.633
While I... I had some of the
power... I lacked the heart.

00:10:16.666 --> 00:10:19.539
You have that which I did not.

00:10:19.572 --> 00:10:22.912
That monster who raised you...

00:10:22.945 --> 00:10:27.588
he had a far purer heart...
than I ever did.

00:10:27.622 --> 00:10:31.830
You don't need to
weep over losing me.

00:10:31.863 --> 00:10:36.272
I know that to you,
he's your real father.

00:10:36.305 --> 00:10:37.575
No. You're wrong.

00:10:37.609 --> 00:10:39.779
He's my grandfather.

00:10:39.812 --> 00:10:44.655
It's not... it's just
not the same thing.

00:10:44.689 --> 00:10:46.191
Speak up.

00:10:46.225 --> 00:10:50.166
I can barely hear
your voice anymore.

00:10:52.605 --> 00:10:53.640
Crocodine: Dai...

00:10:53.674 --> 00:10:55.276
This is your last chance.

00:10:55.309 --> 00:10:58.850
Call out to your father
with all of your strength.

00:11:00.554 --> 00:11:03.460
[crying]

00:11:03.493 --> 00:11:07.300
Don't weep... my son...

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:09.906
You be strong...

00:11:09.939 --> 00:11:14.414
Be strong... and live.

00:11:19.692 --> 00:11:24.100
Dad... Dad, no!

00:12:14.268 --> 00:12:15.972
Baran: Do not weep, Dai.

00:12:16.005 --> 00:12:20.480
Although my body may perish,
my soul lives on.

00:12:20.514 --> 00:12:26.559
I will always be by your side
- in the battle ahead.

00:12:26.592 --> 00:12:29.230
But, Dad, I...

00:12:29.264 --> 00:12:34.876
Baran: We shall always be
together, never to part again.

00:12:34.909 --> 00:12:38.683
So don't give up.
Fight on, my son.

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:42.023
And defeat the
Dark King Vearn.

00:12:42.659 --> 00:12:45.130
[weeping]

00:12:45.163 --> 00:12:48.168
Now get on your feet.
Stand up, my boy.

00:12:48.704 --> 00:12:51.776
Dad, wait!

00:13:00.961 --> 00:13:04.869
You're gonna be all right,
Dai. We're all here with you.

00:13:05.671 --> 00:13:07.107
Dai [thought]: Dad...

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:10.480
I just felt Dad's
heart enter mine.

00:13:10.514 --> 00:13:14.856
I finally know... all the
things he never said...

00:13:14.889 --> 00:13:19.464
everything he felt...
I heard it all.

00:13:35.463 --> 00:13:37.400
[comforting chirp]

00:13:38.837 --> 00:13:42.143
Hey, pal... We should
head back to the base.

00:13:45.918 --> 00:13:47.086
I'm sorry.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.126
I know that nothing we
say will ease your loss.

00:13:50.159 --> 00:13:52.230
But we're in enemy territory.

00:13:52.264 --> 00:13:56.940
You know as well as I do
that we can't stop here.

00:13:56.973 --> 00:13:59.177
Whoa, wait - what
are you saying?

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:01.917
Do you really think now's
the time to go charging

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.920
off after the Dark King?

00:14:04.789 --> 00:14:06.025
Are you serious?!

00:14:06.058 --> 00:14:08.697
Show a bit of humanity, here!

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:10.099
I mean, c'mon-

00:14:10.133 --> 00:14:13.707
the poor guy just lost his
father right before his eyes...

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.978
What can he do in this state?

00:14:16.011 --> 00:14:18.984
We need to retreat and
come up with a plan!

00:14:19.017 --> 00:14:21.321
You guys? Listen to me!

00:14:22.691 --> 00:14:24.094
Hyunckel: Popp...

00:14:24.127 --> 00:14:28.469
Losing someone like that can
cut deeper than any sword will.

00:14:31.075 --> 00:14:33.278
I know that much for myself.

00:14:36.485 --> 00:14:39.291
But consider why Baran
might have done this,

00:14:39.324 --> 00:14:41.495
not just the fact
that he's gone.

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:46.071
He sacrificed himself
to make a path for us.

00:14:46.104 --> 00:14:48.643
With Hadlar and his Royal
Guard out of the way-

00:14:48.677 --> 00:14:53.185
getting to the Dark King's
throne should be easy. Right?

00:14:53.219 --> 00:14:57.227
But, if we give them time,
their forces will only regroup.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:01.569
We have to seize the opportunity
that Baran gave to us, Popp!

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:03.607
Yeah, but still...

00:15:03.641 --> 00:15:07.681
If we retreat now, then all of
this will have been for nothing.

00:15:07.715 --> 00:15:09.285
There are people out there

00:15:09.318 --> 00:15:11.956
that are counting
on us to keep fighting.

00:15:11.989 --> 00:15:14.863
I know that Dai's
father would.

00:15:14.896 --> 00:15:16.666
Okay, maybe so, it's just...

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.001
Dai: Popp.

00:15:19.137 --> 00:15:22.544
Dai: Don't worry
about me. I'm fine.

00:15:23.179 --> 00:15:24.815
They're right. Let's go.

00:15:24.848 --> 00:15:27.253
Hang on - are you
sure about this?

00:15:27.286 --> 00:15:30.594
That means you'd be
leaving your father behind.

00:15:30.627 --> 00:15:31.662
Dai: It doesn't.

00:15:33.065 --> 00:15:34.802
My dad is...

00:15:34.835 --> 00:15:36.539
He's right here.

00:15:36.573 --> 00:15:37.708
Aw, Dai...

00:15:37.741 --> 00:15:43.654
He told me to stop crying -
and to finish this fight.

00:15:43.687 --> 00:15:46.024
So we have to move forward.

00:15:46.057 --> 00:15:49.331
Otherwise, he'll
yell at me again.

00:15:49.364 --> 00:15:51.034
[crying]

00:15:51.067 --> 00:15:53.205
All right. You win
this one, Dai.

00:15:53.238 --> 00:15:57.515
If you want to fight, then I'm
gonna be right by your side.

00:15:57.548 --> 00:16:00.520
So, then - let's finish
this and go home.

00:16:00.554 --> 00:16:03.426
Let's go kick that Dark
King's butt, alright?

00:16:03.459 --> 00:16:04.595
Yeah!

00:16:10.707 --> 00:16:13.346
Killvearn: [menacing chuckle]

00:16:13.379 --> 00:16:16.953
Killvearn: I think you've got
that backwards, little Mage.

00:16:16.986 --> 00:16:20.594
Killvearn: [laughing]

00:16:20.627 --> 00:16:21.996
Both: It's Killvearn!

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:23.733
Both: And Mystvearn, too.

00:16:23.766 --> 00:16:25.135
Killvearn: I have a suggestion.

00:16:25.169 --> 00:16:29.913
Why don't you try repeating
all that... to his face?

00:16:29.946 --> 00:16:31.081
W-What?!

00:16:31.115 --> 00:16:33.352
Mystvearn: All hail!

00:16:35.356 --> 00:16:39.163
Mystvearn: Vearn, the Dark King,
shall grant an audience.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.742
[gasp]

00:17:18.209 --> 00:17:21.348
So, you... So you are...

00:17:21.381 --> 00:17:26.258
Indeed, child. I am
the great Dark King Vearn.

00:17:38.584 --> 00:17:40.620
[chuckle]

00:17:40.654 --> 00:17:42.023
Are you kidding me?

00:17:42.057 --> 00:17:44.896
That old geezer's
the Dark King, huh?

00:17:44.929 --> 00:17:46.097
What a letdown...

00:17:46.131 --> 00:17:48.536
But on the bright side
we can go home early.

00:17:48.569 --> 00:17:52.209
Yeah - this shouldn't be
too hard. Right, you guys?

00:17:54.114 --> 00:17:56.084
[uneasy laughing]

00:17:56.819 --> 00:17:58.188
Popp [thought]:
Oh, come on.

00:17:58.221 --> 00:18:00.694
Will somebody say
something here?

00:18:00.727 --> 00:18:04.100
Now things are even more
uncomfortable than before!

00:18:05.804 --> 00:18:07.006
Killvearn: Well, Popp.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.376
It looks like
everyone else is

00:18:08.409 --> 00:18:11.214
a little quicker in
realizing that King Vearn

00:18:11.248 --> 00:18:14.788
is far more than
meets the eye.

00:18:17.995 --> 00:18:19.865
I expect it's
quite a shock to you

00:18:19.898 --> 00:18:22.972
former members of
the Dark Army.

00:18:23.005 --> 00:18:26.680
While you may not have ever
interacted with him directly,

00:18:26.713 --> 00:18:30.286
I know you still recognize
the overwhelming pressure

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:34.327
of our Dark King's
venerable presence.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:39.203
His calm demeanor must feel
truly... unsettling, for you.

00:18:43.714 --> 00:18:47.353
Oh, yeah? And what makes
you think you're right-

00:18:47.387 --> 00:18:49.726
you bargain-bin bad guy?!

00:18:49.759 --> 00:18:51.094
Killvearn: It's obvious.

00:18:51.127 --> 00:18:53.432
It's the same
expression Hadlar had

00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:56.706
when he first laid
eyes upon King Vearn;

00:18:56.739 --> 00:18:58.643
utter terror.

00:19:00.881 --> 00:19:02.283
Vearn: Killvearn...

00:19:04.187 --> 00:19:06.926
You don't need to scare them.

00:19:06.959 --> 00:19:11.970
Why do you think I went to the
trouble of revealing myself?

00:19:12.003 --> 00:19:13.840
Killvearn: Sorry, sir.

00:19:13.874 --> 00:19:16.177
Woo-wee. You made him mad.

00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:30.640
Well, you've all
made it this far.

00:19:30.674 --> 00:19:32.577
My congratulations.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.521
Vearn: I was certain that by
now you would be defeated.

00:19:37.555 --> 00:19:39.825
With Hadlar and
his Royal Guard,

00:19:39.859 --> 00:19:44.033
our victory seemed
inevitable, to be honest.

00:19:44.067 --> 00:19:49.210
And if he had failed, the Black
Core should have done the trick.

00:19:49.243 --> 00:19:53.085
Vearn Palace was supposed
to take to the skies,

00:19:53.118 --> 00:19:55.456
but only when
all of our enemies

00:19:55.489 --> 00:19:58.830
had been eliminated for good.

00:19:58.863 --> 00:20:02.304
Even with Baran helping
you in his final moments,

00:20:02.337 --> 00:20:05.376
the fact that you,
the Disciples of Avan,

00:20:05.409 --> 00:20:10.320
are standing here is
nothing short of a miracle.

00:20:10.353 --> 00:20:12.724
Alright. So what if it is?!

00:20:12.758 --> 00:20:16.933
Well, you've earned a reward.
Would you not agree?

00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:18.435
A token of some sort,

00:20:18.469 --> 00:20:22.143
to commend you for your
miraculous deeds, no?

00:20:22.176 --> 00:20:23.279
Reward?

00:20:23.312 --> 00:20:25.850
See, I have thought it over.

00:20:25.884 --> 00:20:30.425
"What gift could they possible
desire? Now, at the end?"

00:20:30.459 --> 00:20:34.668
Nothing - only
my complete demise.

00:20:36.806 --> 00:20:37.541
And, yet...

00:20:37.574 --> 00:20:39.579
Mystvearn and Killvearn here

00:20:39.612 --> 00:20:42.919
are both easily as
strong as Hadlar was,

00:20:42.952 --> 00:20:45.523
if not even stronger.

00:20:45.557 --> 00:20:47.193
You may find it difficult

00:20:47.227 --> 00:20:49.197
to claim your prize
in combat against

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:53.472
the three of us - if that
were to be the case.

00:20:53.506 --> 00:20:56.344
Vearn: But I shall
grant you that chance.

00:20:56.377 --> 00:20:59.183
These two will not intervene.

00:20:59.217 --> 00:21:02.991
You have an opportunity
to defeat me at last.

00:21:03.025 --> 00:21:05.429
That is your reward.

00:21:05.463 --> 00:21:07.734
Vearn: Exciting, isn't it?

00:21:07.768 --> 00:21:10.674
To act without the aid
of my two greatest warriors

00:21:10.708 --> 00:21:15.315
is something I haven't done had
the chance to do in centuries.

00:21:20.259 --> 00:21:21.595
Popp [thought]: No way...

00:21:21.629 --> 00:21:24.233
It has to be
some kind of trick...

00:21:24.267 --> 00:21:26.004
He's acting like
he's invincible-

00:21:26.037 --> 00:21:30.079
but that's impossible, isn't it?

00:21:30.112 --> 00:21:32.116
He's gonna regret this!

00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:33.452
Shall we, then?

00:21:33.485 --> 00:21:36.091
Surely you won't refuse me?

00:21:36.125 --> 00:21:37.661
Well, of course not.

00:21:37.694 --> 00:21:40.199
Even if you had
Mystvearn and the Reaper-

00:21:40.233 --> 00:21:41.835
we're not gonna back down.

00:21:41.869 --> 00:21:45.543
We've come this far and won
every battle along the way.

00:21:47.179 --> 00:21:48.516
Vearn: Very well.

00:21:49.785 --> 00:21:51.589
Then let us begin.

00:23:37.801 --> 00:23:40.740
Narrator: The battle against
the Dark King begins at last,

00:23:40.773 --> 00:23:44.848
and even alone, Vearn fights
with a smile on his face.

00:23:44.882 --> 00:23:47.988
Overwhelmed by his
Dark Aura and Magic Power,

00:23:48.021 --> 00:23:50.560
the Disciples of Avan
are driven back,

00:23:50.594 --> 00:23:54.500
but not before Vearn
unleashes his fearsome magic.

00:23:54.535 --> 00:23:56.404
Will Dai and his
friends prevail?

00:23:56.437 --> 00:23:57.908
