00:01:52.592 --> 00:01:56.834
Narrator: This is a story
of the great Hero, Sir Avan,

00:01:56.868 --> 00:01:58.269
from days long ago,

00:01:58.302 --> 00:02:01.475
when he served as a member
of the Order of Carl...

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.584
and the Dark Lord Hadlar sought
to rule the Surface World.

00:02:06.252 --> 00:02:08.356
Hadlar: The time has come...

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.669
At long last, the fate of
the world is within my grasp.

00:02:14.703 --> 00:02:17.542
[snarling]

00:02:17.576 --> 00:02:20.280
Hadlar: Now go forth,
my monsters.

00:02:20.313 --> 00:02:23.019
Wipe out the pathetic humans.

00:02:23.052 --> 00:02:25.324
Burn their towns, their homes!

00:02:25.357 --> 00:02:28.665
Lay waste to their nations!

00:02:28.698 --> 00:02:31.002
Narrator: Against
the fearsome Dark Lord

00:02:31.035 --> 00:02:32.872
and his legion of creatures...

00:02:32.906 --> 00:02:35.477
the human armies
were helpless.

00:02:35.511 --> 00:02:38.617
It quickly seemed as
if evil would triumph.

00:02:39.485 --> 00:02:42.558
But the Kingdom of
Carl stood resolute,

00:02:42.592 --> 00:02:46.465
fending off the Dark Army's
invasion at every turn.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.305
With their elite
order of knights,

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:51.810
led by the brave Sir Roka,

00:02:51.844 --> 00:02:55.952
the nation became the last
bastion of hope for humanity-

00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:58.590
and a thorn in
the Dark Lord's side.

00:02:58.624 --> 00:03:04.769
Hadlar: Curse you, Carl Kingdom.
I will find your weakness.

00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:07.775
Oh!

00:03:09.846 --> 00:03:11.583
Man: It's the Princess!

00:03:13.352 --> 00:03:17.294
My good people,
lend me your ears.

00:03:17.327 --> 00:03:19.533
Flora: No matter how
much chaos the Dark Army

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:24.643
may bring to our world,
we have no reason to fear.

00:03:24.676 --> 00:03:29.084
In fact, the Dark Lord is
the one who fears us.

00:03:29.117 --> 00:03:30.621
For we humans
have the power to

00:03:30.655 --> 00:03:34.328
unite in a way that his
monsters never could.

00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:37.736
And that is why I shall
ride into battle myself...

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.975
Together with our
mighty Order of Carl!

00:03:41.008 --> 00:03:43.547
Princess Flora sure is brave.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.518
Citizen: We'll fight,
too, Your Highness!

00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:47.288
Narrator: Because her father,

00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:50.294
the King of Carl,
was sick and bedridden,

00:03:50.327 --> 00:03:53.568
the princess took
his place on the throne.

00:03:53.601 --> 00:03:55.871
Thanks to her great
beauty and courage,

00:03:55.905 --> 00:03:59.144
Flora's leadership soon
became a source of hope

00:03:59.178 --> 00:04:01.482
for the rest of the world.

00:04:06.694 --> 00:04:09.465
Aide: An excellent
speech, Your Highness.

00:04:09.498 --> 00:04:11.637
Oh, I'm merely doing my job.

00:04:11.671 --> 00:04:16.479
If anyone deserves the praise,
it's you - along with the Order.

00:04:16.513 --> 00:04:20.689
Aide: Speaking of the Order,
it appears he's missing again.

00:04:20.722 --> 00:04:21.690
Avan?

00:04:21.723 --> 00:04:22.759
Flora: [giggling]

00:04:22.792 --> 00:04:26.800
Ah, yes. He has a way of
disappearing, doesn't he?

00:04:26.834 --> 00:04:28.135
I'll go and get him.

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.912
Ugh, skipping yet another royal
address - what a disgrace!

00:04:32.946 --> 00:04:35.116
It's quite all
right, Sir Roka.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.556
No, it's not.
He needs discipline.

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:40.360
And I know exactly
where he is.

00:04:44.435 --> 00:04:48.644
Avan: Something's missing here.
This broth is too thin.

00:04:48.677 --> 00:04:53.185
Woman: Oh, no! But I made
it just for you, Sir Avan.

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:56.761
Avan: We can save it. All it
needs is a little more kick.

00:04:56.794 --> 00:04:59.264
If we mix in some
ground Feverfew stem,

00:04:59.298 --> 00:05:01.235
I think it will all
come together...

00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:04.208
There. Let's let that simmer.

00:05:04.242 --> 00:05:06.914
Feverfew is great for
illnesses and injuries.

00:05:06.947 --> 00:05:09.553
Plus, it's very nutritious.

00:05:09.586 --> 00:05:11.489
Now for our secret ingredient,

00:05:11.523 --> 00:05:13.660
we'll add a pinch
of Agility Seed.

00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:18.437
Wow, Sir Avan. I didn't
know you could cook.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.142
You can try my soup
anytime you like to!

00:05:21.175 --> 00:05:22.311
Roka: Avan!

00:05:22.344 --> 00:05:25.451
Ah, greetings, Sir Roka.
Is there a problem?

00:05:25.484 --> 00:05:27.387
Don't play innocent with me.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.693
Well, you're just in
time to have some lunch.

00:05:29.726 --> 00:05:32.064
It's too bad you
didn't bring some bread.

00:05:32.098 --> 00:05:33.667
Roka: Come with me!

00:05:34.468 --> 00:05:37.808
Women: Aw... Come back soon!

00:05:39.144 --> 00:05:42.685
Roka: Honestly, you have got
to get your act together.

00:05:42.718 --> 00:05:45.692
Skipping your guard duty
to give a cooking class?!

00:05:45.725 --> 00:05:48.631
I know, I apologize. Really.

00:05:48.664 --> 00:05:50.701
But Roka, you're
the Order's strongest.

00:05:50.735 --> 00:05:52.605
We both know you
could probably guard

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:54.676
the whole castle yourself.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.483
Our soldiers need good, quality
food to keep their strength up.

00:05:58.517 --> 00:06:00.020
Improving the quality
of what they eat

00:06:00.053 --> 00:06:02.758
is a better way for
me to serve the kingdom.

00:06:07.468 --> 00:06:08.671
Then open a restaurant.

00:06:08.704 --> 00:06:10.774
Why you were chosen
for the Order of Carl

00:06:10.808 --> 00:06:13.312
is one of life's
great mysteries.

00:06:13.346 --> 00:06:15.552
It's probably
because I study.

00:06:15.585 --> 00:06:17.120
The Zinuar family has raised

00:06:17.154 --> 00:06:20.159
a long line of
scholars, you know.

00:06:20.193 --> 00:06:24.769
Listen up. We're in the
age of war now - not books.

00:06:24.803 --> 00:06:26.873
Roka: I hope you're
not busy reading

00:06:26.906 --> 00:06:29.512
on the day the
Dark Lord attacks.

00:06:29.545 --> 00:06:30.815
I'll be ready.

00:06:30.848 --> 00:06:32.952
Not if you spend
all your time studying

00:06:32.986 --> 00:06:35.791
and being fawned over by
girls like that, Avan.

00:06:35.824 --> 00:06:38.430
You could at least
pick up a sword.

00:06:38.463 --> 00:06:39.866
Avan: I know
that's important,

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.705
but don't you hope to
have a family someday?

00:06:42.738 --> 00:06:45.310
Just think, you might even
have an adorable child

00:06:45.344 --> 00:06:46.846
who takes after you.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.557
If you haven't at least figured
out how to cook by then...

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.395
No, I'm devoting
my life to the sword.

00:06:54.429 --> 00:06:55.865
Who needs a family?

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:58.737
You sure about that?
Family is a gift.

00:06:58.771 --> 00:07:00.574
You'll regret missing out.

00:07:00.608 --> 00:07:03.981
I'd rather run across the
kingdom naked than get married.

00:07:04.015 --> 00:07:06.854
A real soldier has
no time for regret.

00:07:06.887 --> 00:07:07.889
[bemused chuckle]

00:07:07.922 --> 00:07:10.761
Anyways. You need to
defend yourself in battle.

00:07:10.795 --> 00:07:12.766
Practice enough
for that, at least.

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:14.803
Your type might
be the hopeless kind,

00:07:14.837 --> 00:07:17.107
but you can still
study the technique.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.386
Yes, I understand. Roka.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:29.398
You said it yourself...
there's a war coming.

00:07:29.431 --> 00:07:31.803
[screaming]

00:07:31.837 --> 00:07:33.640
Roka: Your Highness,
what's wrong?

00:07:34.107 --> 00:07:35.343
W-What is this?!

00:07:35.376 --> 00:07:37.582
Blood writing.
It- It just appeared.

00:07:37.615 --> 00:07:39.251
What language is that?

00:07:39.284 --> 00:07:41.790
Avan: The language
of the Darklings.

00:07:41.824 --> 00:07:45.430
This is a communication
spell that uses mirrors.

00:07:45.464 --> 00:07:48.804
Now, let's see.
I can translate:

00:07:48.838 --> 00:07:52.311
"Tonight, I shall claim
the Princess as a sacrifice

00:07:52.344 --> 00:07:55.316
in the name of the
God of the Underworld.

00:07:55.349 --> 00:07:56.553
The Dark Lord."

00:07:56.586 --> 00:07:57.956
What? Oh, no.

00:07:57.989 --> 00:07:58.891
He wants the Princess?

00:07:58.924 --> 00:08:01.830
Let's go. We'll increase
security at once.

00:08:01.863 --> 00:08:02.832
Avan...

00:08:08.777 --> 00:08:12.117
Knight: All of our forces are
on high alert, Captain Roka.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:13.554
Roka: Very good.

00:08:13.587 --> 00:08:16.994
All right, Lord Hadlar.
We're ready for you.

00:08:17.027 --> 00:08:19.933
Roka, did Avan
tell you where he went?

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:23.541
Roka: Avan? Ah, he said
he had important business

00:08:23.574 --> 00:08:26.212
and took off into the woods.

00:08:26.245 --> 00:08:27.481
Flora: The woods?

00:08:27.515 --> 00:08:28.951
That's right.

00:08:28.985 --> 00:08:31.590
I told him there's nothing more
important than your safety...

00:08:31.623 --> 00:08:33.760
But I give you my word-

00:08:33.794 --> 00:08:37.101
we'll be able to protect
you even without that fool.

00:08:37.134 --> 00:08:39.137
You have no reason to fear.

00:08:40.708 --> 00:08:43.345
Roka [thought]: Damn it,
Avan. I trusted you!

00:08:43.379 --> 00:08:45.083
After everything
we talked about,

00:08:45.116 --> 00:08:47.487
you'd run away at
a time like this?

00:08:47.522 --> 00:08:50.761
This is the last straw.
You and I are through.

00:08:57.207 --> 00:08:58.744
Look at that - up there!

00:09:02.552 --> 00:09:03.987
W-What's that light?!

00:09:08.463 --> 00:09:10.334
Guard: It's the Dark Lord!

00:09:10.367 --> 00:09:12.170
Everyone at the ready!

00:09:14.108 --> 00:09:15.310
Pathetic.

00:09:15.344 --> 00:09:17.916
I'll show you true power.

00:09:17.949 --> 00:09:18.717
Gush!

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.321
Come out and
destroy the humans.

00:09:23.694 --> 00:09:25.864
-[attacking grunts]
-[frightened yells]

00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:28.169
[roaring]

00:09:32.444 --> 00:09:34.347
[snarling]

00:09:35.618 --> 00:09:38.523
Captain, there's a
whole horde of monsters!

00:09:38.557 --> 00:09:41.328
Roka: What? Where
did they come from?!

00:09:46.172 --> 00:09:49.478
[cackling]

00:09:49.512 --> 00:09:51.081
Let's do this.

00:09:51.115 --> 00:09:52.283
[roaring]

00:09:53.653 --> 00:09:55.824
[pained groans]

00:09:56.693 --> 00:09:59.231
Damn, he's so powerful.

00:09:59.264 --> 00:10:01.503
Hadlar: Princess Flora.

00:10:01.536 --> 00:10:05.844
It's such a pleasure to finally
be meeting you face-to-face.

00:10:05.878 --> 00:10:08.751
I have come to claim
you as my prize.

00:10:08.784 --> 00:10:10.788
[malevolent laughter]

00:10:10.821 --> 00:10:14.361
Lord Hadlar, I can
see what you're up to.

00:10:14.395 --> 00:10:19.305
Capturing me for the God of the
Underworld is just an excuse.

00:10:19.338 --> 00:10:20.206
Hadlar: Oh?

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.545
You want to break
my people's resolve.

00:10:22.578 --> 00:10:24.081
Leave them leaderless.

00:10:24.114 --> 00:10:26.318
If I surrender myself
to the Dark Lord-

00:10:26.351 --> 00:10:29.225
no one will be left to
stop you from taking over

00:10:29.258 --> 00:10:30.928
the rest of the human world.

00:10:30.962 --> 00:10:32.096
How wise.

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:35.838
You may be young, but
you're still full of wisdom.

00:10:35.872 --> 00:10:38.043
Why don't you spare your
kingdom the trouble...

00:10:38.076 --> 00:10:41.884
and kneel before me
while you still can?

00:10:41.917 --> 00:10:43.118
Never!

00:10:48.363 --> 00:10:49.999
Well, if you insist,

00:10:50.033 --> 00:10:52.805
then I can kill
you right here.

00:10:57.447 --> 00:10:59.451
Princess!

00:10:59.485 --> 00:11:02.825
So, which option
would you prefer...

00:11:02.859 --> 00:11:05.731
Submission, or doom?

00:11:06.633 --> 00:11:08.970
Hadlar: Make your
choice, girl.

00:11:10.406 --> 00:11:13.078
Avan: You call that a choice?

00:11:18.489 --> 00:11:19.457
Avan.

00:11:20.327 --> 00:11:21.963
He's back!

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.221
And who, pray tell, are you?

00:11:34.254 --> 00:11:34.756
Mister Dark Lord.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:35.925
Well, if you insist,

00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:36.759
If you're trying to
win over a princess...

00:11:36.793 --> 00:11:37.896
I can kill you right here.

00:11:37.929 --> 00:11:39.699
you should really
work on your manners-

00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:40.467
Princess...

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.502
that is, if you ask me.

00:11:41.536 --> 00:11:43.573
So, which option
would you prefer...

00:11:43.606 --> 00:11:44.676
I have no patience
for nonsense!

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:47.781
Submission, or doom?

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:51.388
Hadlar: Make your
choice, girl.

00:11:52.357 --> 00:11:55.062
Avan: You call that a choice?

00:11:57.502 --> 00:11:59.104
Not what I expected.

00:11:59.137 --> 00:12:00.407
This Magic Bullet Gun
needs more work.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.843
Avan.

00:12:02.311 --> 00:12:04.047
[snarling]

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.358
You meddlesome pest...

00:12:09.391 --> 00:12:12.197
Hadlar: What have you
done to my dragon?!

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:13.299
Oh, nothing...

00:12:13.333 --> 00:12:17.541
A bit of spice. Just a
small sprinkle of Coagulant.

00:12:17.574 --> 00:12:19.211
Huh? Coagulant?

00:12:19.244 --> 00:12:22.986
That's right. It's a secret
compound I've been cooking up.

00:12:23.019 --> 00:12:25.356
It seems to be working well.

00:12:25.389 --> 00:12:26.727
Avan: It's made from moth dust.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.366
Toxic to monsters.
Makes them go berserk.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.607
Brilliant. Even the
creatures outside are fighting!

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.412
Yes, I gave them a
pinch on my way here.

00:12:36.446 --> 00:12:38.149
It must be working.

00:12:38.183 --> 00:12:40.253
And now your trusty
legion of monsters

00:12:40.286 --> 00:12:43.192
has been rendered
useless, Lord Hadlar.

00:12:43.225 --> 00:12:46.733
Roka [thought]: So that's
why he went into the forest-

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:48.870
he was catching Poison Moths.

00:12:48.903 --> 00:12:50.807
Not bad, Avan!

00:12:59.358 --> 00:13:00.628
You worm.

00:13:00.661 --> 00:13:05.170
How dare you humiliate me with
such cowardly parlor tricks?

00:13:05.203 --> 00:13:06.973
Now you pay!

00:13:07.006 --> 00:13:10.012
Avan: I'll pay
for it? No, no...

00:13:12.484 --> 00:13:13.521
Hadlar [thought]: What?

00:13:13.554 --> 00:13:14.989
What a powerful Aura...

00:13:15.022 --> 00:13:17.528
From such a
frail-looking man?!

00:13:17.562 --> 00:13:21.903
You are the one who's about
to pay here, Dark Lord!

00:13:26.012 --> 00:13:27.247
Flora [thought]:
Wait a minute!

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.419
I've seen that expression
on Avan's face before.

00:13:30.453 --> 00:13:33.192
It was three years ago,
but I'd never forget it.

00:13:33.226 --> 00:13:35.463
Before I knew all the
dangers of the forest,

00:13:35.496 --> 00:13:38.870
I snuck out of the castle
looking for adventure...

00:13:46.018 --> 00:13:48.355
[terrified shriek]

00:14:00.514 --> 00:14:02.083
Flora [thought]: When
that monster attacked,

00:14:02.117 --> 00:14:04.488
Avan must have been
somewhere nearby.

00:14:04.522 --> 00:14:06.324
I'd be gone without him.

00:14:10.199 --> 00:14:12.070
Flora [thought]:
I told him who I was,

00:14:12.103 --> 00:14:13.406
and in thanks I gave him

00:14:13.439 --> 00:14:16.947
my recommendation
to join the Order.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.884
Flora [thought]:
But once they took him on,

00:14:18.917 --> 00:14:20.788
he arrived to his
first day of training

00:14:20.821 --> 00:14:22.625
in those odd glasses....

00:14:22.658 --> 00:14:26.432
and he acted as though he
had no idea how to fight.

00:14:26.465 --> 00:14:31.375
It was like he was trying to
keep his immense power a secret.

00:14:31.408 --> 00:14:33.045
But he never fooled me.

00:14:33.078 --> 00:14:35.885
I could tell that he was
only acting that way

00:14:35.918 --> 00:14:38.189
because he didn't
want to show off,

00:14:38.222 --> 00:14:40.895
or put the others to shame.

00:14:40.928 --> 00:14:42.598
I know it seems silly.

00:14:42.631 --> 00:14:45.336
But it would crush morale
if the Order knew...

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:46.606
If the need arises,

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.681
I promise to use all my power
to protect you and the Kingdom.

00:14:50.714 --> 00:14:52.885
However, until
that time comes...

00:14:52.918 --> 00:14:54.589
I understand.

00:14:54.622 --> 00:14:58.428
And I promise to keep what
I know about you a secret.

00:15:01.369 --> 00:15:04.007
Flora [thought]: The time has
finally come to show them all

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.977
what you've been hiding, Avan.

00:15:08.049 --> 00:15:10.654
I do hope you realize
that if you're stupid enough

00:15:10.688 --> 00:15:14.461
to pick a fight with me,
I won't hold anything back.

00:15:14.495 --> 00:15:16.031
Oh, I don't want to fight.

00:15:16.064 --> 00:15:19.672
But I... I hope you do realize
that I can't sit by and

00:15:19.705 --> 00:15:23.580
watch someone hurt others for
their own ambitions, either.

00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:28.656
And don't assume
I'm so naïve.

00:15:32.029 --> 00:15:33.834
That's enough.

00:15:33.867 --> 00:15:35.136
Frizzle!

00:15:36.873 --> 00:15:38.175
What... How?!

00:15:38.209 --> 00:15:41.516
Whoa! Since when can
Avan cast a spell?

00:15:41.549 --> 00:15:42.584
Sizzle!

00:15:44.589 --> 00:15:46.860
Hadlar [thought]: He's using
highly advanced magic...

00:15:46.893 --> 00:15:49.230
especially for a mere human.

00:15:50.768 --> 00:15:52.370
Oh, man - I never knew

00:15:52.403 --> 00:15:54.307
Avan had this
kind of strength.

00:15:54.341 --> 00:15:56.311
Knight: C'mon!
You can do it!

00:16:04.662 --> 00:16:06.298
[frustrated groan]

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:16.151
Avan: It's over... Kafrizz!

00:16:19.357 --> 00:16:21.896
Well, well. Not a bad show.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:25.905
But you're still
only a human being.

00:16:25.938 --> 00:16:28.208
Compared to my Magic Power,

00:16:28.241 --> 00:16:32.016
yours is a trivial
inconvenience.

00:16:32.049 --> 00:16:35.256
Avan [thought]: He can
cast a Kaboom spell?

00:16:35.289 --> 00:16:39.063
No... If I dodge it,
he'll hit the Princess.

00:16:45.376 --> 00:16:46.411
[shocked gasp]

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.121
Use your head. Stand down
and I'll show you mercy.

00:16:58.771 --> 00:17:02.243
As you wish. Perish!

00:17:07.988 --> 00:17:10.059
[agonized snarl]

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.038
You worthless...

00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:17.373
[pained howl]

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:19.946
Avan: Roka!

00:17:19.979 --> 00:17:20.981
[weakened chuckle]

00:17:21.015 --> 00:17:23.553
Oh, yeah. I got him good.

00:17:23.587 --> 00:17:27.594
He won't be casting that
spell anytime soon, will he?

00:17:29.665 --> 00:17:33.138
Hadlar: Very well. A Boom
spell will have to suffice...

00:17:33.171 --> 00:17:36.345
Now, I'll reduce you
all to ash!

00:17:36.378 --> 00:17:40.654
You dare... You dare
to hurt my friend...

00:17:40.687 --> 00:17:41.689
This is it!

00:17:43.325 --> 00:17:44.093
Boom!

00:17:44.127 --> 00:17:47.534
[roaring]

00:17:50.206 --> 00:17:52.844
Wh-What's this
blinding light?!

00:17:52.878 --> 00:17:56.484
[howling]

00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:04.902
Knight: He did it!

00:18:04.936 --> 00:18:07.874
Avan really defeated
the Dark Lord.

00:18:08.676 --> 00:18:10.648
What a surprise.

00:18:10.681 --> 00:18:12.350
[chuckling]

00:18:13.586 --> 00:18:16.626
Avan: No. The Dark Lord
is still alive.

00:18:16.659 --> 00:18:18.395
[confused breaths]

00:18:18.428 --> 00:18:21.368
If he were
really gone for good...

00:18:22.203 --> 00:18:24.842
that arm would crumble to ash.

00:18:26.078 --> 00:18:28.116
He must still be out there.

00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:29.785
Hadlar: [evil laughter]

00:18:29.819 --> 00:18:32.658
Well done. Very observant!

00:18:32.691 --> 00:18:36.297
I suppose I will retreat
for the time being.

00:18:36.331 --> 00:18:40.240
But you'll never defeat
me with such paltry powers.

00:18:40.273 --> 00:18:42.578
Mark my words, Avan...

00:18:42.612 --> 00:18:45.349
You are beyond hope.

00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:48.523
[cackling]

00:18:50.894 --> 00:18:52.163
Avan [thought]: He's right.

00:18:52.197 --> 00:18:54.300
With my current
level of power,

00:18:54.333 --> 00:18:57.340
I won't be able
to finish him off.

00:19:08.696 --> 00:19:11.268
Flora: I wish you didn't
have to leave, Avan.

00:19:11.301 --> 00:19:14.542
These glasses are
a symbol of peace.

00:19:14.576 --> 00:19:19.952
So until you defeat him - and
save the world from darkness...

00:19:19.985 --> 00:19:23.292
I shall hold onto
them for you.

00:19:23.325 --> 00:19:26.832
I'll try to be
back soon, Flora.

00:19:26.866 --> 00:19:29.873
Flora: Meanwhile,
I'd like you to have this.

00:19:29.906 --> 00:19:31.408
It's the Amulet of Carl-

00:19:31.441 --> 00:19:33.846
an heirloom of
the royal family.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.986
I'm sure its enchantment
will help you someday.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:41.261
Well, then,
this charm is for you.

00:19:41.294 --> 00:19:44.234
It's a Mysticite
pendant that was carved

00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:47.073
using a special Zinuar
family technique.

00:19:47.106 --> 00:19:52.384
I'm the only one left who knows
the secret to making these.

00:19:52.417 --> 00:19:55.189
You would give me
something so valuable?

00:19:55.223 --> 00:19:57.493
Avan, are you sure?

00:19:57.528 --> 00:19:58.262
[chuckle]

00:19:58.295 --> 00:19:59.865
Call it a trade.

00:20:07.881 --> 00:20:09.050
Roka.

00:20:09.084 --> 00:20:11.589
I'm coming with
you, my friend.

00:20:11.622 --> 00:20:13.760
I still need to
pay back the Dark Lord

00:20:13.794 --> 00:20:16.165
for making a mess out
of our great kingdom.

00:20:16.198 --> 00:20:17.701
And just take off?

00:20:17.734 --> 00:20:19.705
But without the
captain of its Order-

00:20:19.738 --> 00:20:22.845
who's going to
protect Carl Kingdom?

00:20:22.878 --> 00:20:23.846
It's no problem.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.149
The Order is well trained,

00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:27.587
they can look after
things while we're gone.

00:20:27.621 --> 00:20:31.394
And besides, we can't do much
more just defending ourselves.

00:20:31.428 --> 00:20:33.733
Let's hit Hadlar
where it hurts.

00:20:33.766 --> 00:20:35.937
The best defense
is a good offense!

00:20:35.971 --> 00:20:40.279
So they say... but there's no
guarantee that we can win.

00:20:40.313 --> 00:20:42.651
It's the Dark
Lord, after all.

00:20:42.684 --> 00:20:43.986
I saw hope-

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.393
something real in that blade
of light you were wielding.

00:20:47.426 --> 00:20:50.099
Oh, that? That was...
a coincidence.

00:20:50.132 --> 00:20:51.101
Roka: Yeah, yeah.

00:20:51.135 --> 00:20:52.838
Coincidence or not,

00:20:52.871 --> 00:20:56.245
you still managed to
drive back that menace.

00:20:56.278 --> 00:20:59.718
And that... Well,
let's call it a start.

00:21:10.507 --> 00:21:12.176
Narrator: It would
take much training

00:21:12.209 --> 00:21:14.515
and countless battles
to hone its power...

00:21:14.548 --> 00:21:18.356
But one day, that blinding
light and its master would

00:21:18.389 --> 00:21:21.529
become known throughout
the entire world.

00:21:25.135 --> 00:21:29.611
Avan... Strash!

00:23:05.737 --> 00:23:07.240
Narrator:
In order to bind with

00:23:07.273 --> 00:23:09.377
the Great Purification
Spell, Kaglimmer,

00:23:09.411 --> 00:23:13.252
Leona braves the
monster-infested Cave of Trials.
