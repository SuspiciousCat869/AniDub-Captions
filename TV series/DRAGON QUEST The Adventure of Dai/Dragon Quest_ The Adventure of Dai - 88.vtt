WEBVTT

00:01:50.354 --> 00:01:52.190
Here comes another!

00:01:54.462 --> 00:01:56.098
[snarling]

00:01:56.132 --> 00:01:58.570
[roaring]

00:01:59.573 --> 00:02:04.883
[roaring]

00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:08.524
[defeated roar]

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:16.238
[pained grunts]

00:02:53.815 --> 00:02:56.285
Did... Did it work?

00:02:56.887 --> 00:02:57.889
Dai: Yeah.

00:02:59.025 --> 00:02:59.926
Dai!

00:03:00.595 --> 00:03:02.098
I-I'm okay.

00:03:02.131 --> 00:03:04.870
Don't worry. I just feel
a little worn out.

00:03:04.904 --> 00:03:05.905
[victorious chuckle]

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.911
I knew... using
Doruora twice...

00:03:08.945 --> 00:03:10.915
was gonna take its toll...

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:14.188
But... the only reason
I was able to pull that off

00:03:14.221 --> 00:03:16.325
is 'cause you could tell
what I was thinking.

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:17.795
Thanks for the help.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:20.868
Honestly, though.

00:03:20.902 --> 00:03:24.341
What made you think to try
using Doruora twice in a row?

00:03:24.374 --> 00:03:27.081
When I realized that Vearn
used that staff of his

00:03:27.114 --> 00:03:29.586
to withstand the impact
of my first attack,

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.557
I figured if I could
throw another one,

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.696
he wouldn't be strong enough
to hold back the power of both.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.767
Then I remembered
the Healing Feathers

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.773
that Master Avan gave you
and it all clicked.

00:03:39.806 --> 00:03:41.042
Right. I get it.

00:03:41.076 --> 00:03:44.148
It wouldn't work unless he was
too distracted to dodge you...

00:03:44.181 --> 00:03:47.254
But if he was stuck using his
staff to block you instead,

00:03:47.287 --> 00:03:49.726
it gave you a chance
to fire the second attack

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.198
while the energy of the
first was still there...

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:54.903
He must've been hit
with their combined force.

00:03:57.474 --> 00:04:00.948
There's no way...
he could've survived.

00:04:06.492 --> 00:04:07.829
It all happened so quickly,

00:04:07.862 --> 00:04:10.734
it's kind of hard to believe
that it happened at all...

00:04:11.436 --> 00:04:12.872
One things for sure, though:

00:04:12.905 --> 00:04:15.678
Only the Dragon Knight
could have done it.

00:04:15.711 --> 00:04:19.218
To strike something with
Doruora multiple times...

00:04:19.251 --> 00:04:20.555
That's a destructive force that

00:04:20.588 --> 00:04:23.192
normally shouldn't
even be possible.

00:04:23.226 --> 00:04:25.698
You're right. It's
because it was King Vearn.

00:04:25.731 --> 00:04:26.834
Leona: Huh?

00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:29.506
He's probably... the only
being in the whole world

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:31.844
with enough power to
block a Doruora spell.

00:04:31.877 --> 00:04:33.647
Nobody else can do that.

00:04:33.681 --> 00:04:36.118
But it turns out,
he was too strong...

00:04:36.152 --> 00:04:38.256
Because in the end,
his strength...

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.360
is what forced me
to go beyond my limits

00:04:40.393 --> 00:04:43.667
and hit him with something
that was even greater.

00:04:43.701 --> 00:04:46.840
I guess it just goes to show,
no matter how strong you are,

00:04:46.873 --> 00:04:49.546
there's always somebody
stronger out there.

00:04:54.121 --> 00:04:55.157
Oh, come on.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.294
Can't you just be
proud of yourself?

00:04:57.327 --> 00:04:58.798
You did it, little Hero.

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:01.770
Leona: You've defeated
the Dark King!

00:05:05.812 --> 00:05:07.716
Popp: That shockwave
was pretty big...

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:11.155
It's a miracle this
castle's still intact.

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:13.193
Let's hope it
came from Dai...

00:05:13.226 --> 00:05:15.030
Otherwise, he's in trouble.

00:05:15.063 --> 00:05:16.332
We'd better go find out.

00:05:16.365 --> 00:05:17.468
Very well...

00:05:17.502 --> 00:05:19.272
And what should we
do about this one, huh?

00:05:19.305 --> 00:05:21.408
Why don't we just
leave him where he is?

00:05:21.442 --> 00:05:23.681
He's not putting up a
fight like this - so...

00:05:23.714 --> 00:05:25.116
If he's not a threat anymore,

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:26.620
there's no need
to finish him off.

00:05:26.654 --> 00:05:28.958
Right? Tell him, Hyunckel.

00:05:28.991 --> 00:05:30.127
We can show him mercy.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.464
What matters is making
sure Dai's okay.

00:05:33.568 --> 00:05:35.104
You are way too forgiving.

00:05:35.137 --> 00:05:36.439
Just think of how many times

00:05:36.473 --> 00:05:38.342
this guy has pulled
a fast one on us.

00:05:38.376 --> 00:05:40.447
Lon Beruk said that we
should take care of him

00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:41.517
when we get the chance...

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.718
Well, here it is.

00:05:42.752 --> 00:05:44.923
If we don't do it now -
we're gonna regret it.

00:05:44.956 --> 00:05:45.925
So what?

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:47.562
Even if you're right,
if Dai loses to Vearn,

00:05:47.595 --> 00:05:49.566
none of this
will matter anyway.

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:53.139
Let's get moving, or
we will really regret it.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.547
Infighting? Really?

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.820
I've never seen such abysmal
teamwork at a crucial moment -

00:05:59.853 --> 00:06:01.857
Honestly, the Royal
Guard's coordination

00:06:01.891 --> 00:06:03.226
puts you to shame...

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:04.428
[shocked gasp]

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:08.102
[alarmed grunts]

00:06:15.985 --> 00:06:17.087
But how?

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.458
In his state, he shouldn't
be able to move a muscle.

00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:20.995
Is he immortal?

00:06:22.063 --> 00:06:23.266
How about now?

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.738
Do you still feel like mercy's
the right way to go, Maam?!

00:06:25.771 --> 00:06:26.907
Told you so.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.443
Okay... Hym?

00:06:28.476 --> 00:06:30.347
Oh, I'm way
ahead of you, kid.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.017
Don't you worry.

00:06:32.051 --> 00:06:34.522
Let's go!

00:06:34.555 --> 00:06:38.462
Your Majesty...
please forgive me.

00:06:38.496 --> 00:06:40.801
I cannot defy you, but...

00:06:40.834 --> 00:06:43.807
That's enough of your
senseless babbling!

00:07:09.057 --> 00:07:11.863
Mystvearn: I've been left
with no other choice.

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.069
For the first time...

00:07:15.103 --> 00:07:18.309
without receiving your
permission to do so...

00:07:18.342 --> 00:07:21.115
I must reveal my true
and mighty form.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.386
Th-th-that's...

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:25.525
So that's what
Mystvearn's face looks like.

00:07:25.558 --> 00:07:26.660
Larhart [thought]: A human?

00:07:26.693 --> 00:07:29.131
No... He's a Darkling...

00:07:29.164 --> 00:07:31.168
Crocodine [thought]:
So this is his true face...

00:07:31.202 --> 00:07:33.841
The one that struck fear
into the heart of Lon Beruk

00:07:33.874 --> 00:07:36.846
is really that
of this young man?

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.282
Hyunckel [thought]:
This presence...

00:07:38.316 --> 00:07:39.752
I... I recognize it.

00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:54.983
[pained cries]

00:07:55.017 --> 00:07:56.452
Hyunckel [thought]:
All that force...

00:07:56.485 --> 00:07:58.590
from just a simple push?

00:08:00.561 --> 00:08:01.897
Mystvearn: How terrifying...

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.705
Yes, I've done
something truly terrifying.

00:08:05.738 --> 00:08:08.810
Not even I am able to
escape whatever punishment...

00:08:08.844 --> 00:08:12.250
the Dark King decides I should
face for breaking my vow to him.

00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:16.192
With such a grave offense,
my fate will be unavoidable.

00:08:16.225 --> 00:08:17.360
A harsh sentence,

00:08:17.393 --> 00:08:20.634
however, revealing this face
is that great of a crime.

00:08:20.668 --> 00:08:21.803
Especially since...

00:08:21.836 --> 00:08:24.275
I've done it without
King Vearn's permission.

00:08:24.308 --> 00:08:25.511
I hope you're bluffing.

00:08:25.544 --> 00:08:27.281
Because I'm not
seeing anything special.

00:08:27.314 --> 00:08:30.655
What's so great about a
pompous mug like yours, anyway?

00:08:30.688 --> 00:08:32.591
No, wait. Don't - Hym!

00:08:34.996 --> 00:08:37.467
Hym [thought]: What
overwhelming malice!

00:08:37.502 --> 00:08:40.139
Perhaps you're not quite
as thick as I thought.

00:08:40.173 --> 00:08:43.681
You clearly have some sense
of the power which I wield.

00:08:43.714 --> 00:08:45.517
Hym [thought]:
Is that what this is?

00:08:45.551 --> 00:08:47.855
Am I... Am I really
being overwhelmed

00:08:47.889 --> 00:08:50.661
by the mere pressure
of his presence?

00:08:50.694 --> 00:08:51.863
How can that be?

00:08:51.897 --> 00:08:54.101
As far as I can tell,
just by looking at him,

00:08:54.135 --> 00:08:56.372
he's your run-of-the-mill
Darkling...

00:08:56.405 --> 00:08:57.875
And his Dark Aura
was much stronger

00:08:57.908 --> 00:08:59.879
while he still
had his mask on...

00:08:59.912 --> 00:09:02.785
It's like something even
worse has taken its place.

00:09:02.818 --> 00:09:07.161
Very good. You should
be afraid of this...

00:09:07.194 --> 00:09:09.498
I know I certainly am.

00:09:09.532 --> 00:09:10.300
Hym: [scoff]

00:09:10.333 --> 00:09:12.404
Afraid? No chance.

00:09:12.437 --> 00:09:13.974
If you're looking
for something to fear,

00:09:14.008 --> 00:09:15.611
then why don't
you fear this?!

00:09:15.645 --> 00:09:17.548
Hym, stop. You're no
match for him.

00:09:17.581 --> 00:09:19.852
Aura Knuckle!

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.321
Hym: What?

00:09:23.092 --> 00:09:26.733
[pained howl]

00:09:29.539 --> 00:09:30.975
You've gotta be kidding me.

00:09:31.008 --> 00:09:33.647
Orichalcum...
Torn like paper...

00:09:35.149 --> 00:09:36.820
Hyunckel [thought]: It would
take an incredible amount

00:09:36.854 --> 00:09:39.191
of force to twist
Hym's arm off like that...

00:09:39.225 --> 00:09:40.727
Yet he did it so casually.

00:09:40.761 --> 00:09:42.063
And not by using
his opponent's

00:09:42.097 --> 00:09:43.867
strength against
them like I would...

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:45.203
He doesn't need to do that...

00:09:45.236 --> 00:09:47.842
Mystvearn can do it
with his own two hands.

00:09:50.914 --> 00:09:53.118
H-Hey! What are
you doing with my arm?

00:09:56.459 --> 00:09:59.732
My... how very
impressive, Larhart.

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:02.103
A strike from any
average opponent...

00:10:02.137 --> 00:10:04.809
wouldn't leave a
dent in Orichalcum.

00:10:06.278 --> 00:10:07.715
[pained groans]

00:10:07.749 --> 00:10:09.251
Mystvearn: The fact
that you shattered

00:10:09.284 --> 00:10:10.854
that arm in a single blow...

00:10:10.888 --> 00:10:14.829
is a testament of your
exceptional strength...

00:10:15.764 --> 00:10:17.200
Nevertheless...

00:10:24.782 --> 00:10:26.886
Mystvearn: You and that
insufferable pawn...

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.258
may be warriors of
the highest order...

00:10:29.291 --> 00:10:33.465
some of the finest the
Surface World has ever known...

00:10:33.499 --> 00:10:36.271
But here, facing
me in this form,

00:10:36.305 --> 00:10:38.476
you have no hope
of prevailing.

00:10:38.511 --> 00:10:39.813
This face you see...

00:10:39.846 --> 00:10:43.319
belongs to the strongest
being of the Underworld ever.

00:10:43.352 --> 00:10:44.321
Both: What?!

00:10:44.355 --> 00:10:46.325
Yeah right. Then what
about King Vearn, huh?

00:10:46.358 --> 00:10:50.199
Surely the Dark King is
greater than his henchman.

00:10:51.737 --> 00:10:54.876
His Majesty is
indeed a great man.

00:10:54.909 --> 00:10:57.447
In our realm, his wisdom
and Magic Power...

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.786
hold unparalleled influence...

00:10:59.819 --> 00:11:03.058
But in terms... of shall
we say practical power...

00:11:03.092 --> 00:11:06.365
my current form
is well beyond his.

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:07.502
So, yes...

00:11:07.535 --> 00:11:11.208
In a manner of speaking,
I am stronger than King Vearn.

00:11:13.178 --> 00:11:14.314
Without my mask,

00:11:14.348 --> 00:11:18.055
I'm the strongest being
in all the Dark Army.

00:11:36.793 --> 00:11:39.498
There. That should do the trick.

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:40.868
I feel better.

00:11:40.902 --> 00:11:42.872
Okay. I'm starting to
worry about the others.

00:11:42.905 --> 00:11:44.543
Let's head back to
the White Garden

00:11:44.576 --> 00:11:46.144
and make sure they're safe.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.353
Uh... H-Huh?

00:11:50.386 --> 00:11:51.523
What the...

00:11:51.556 --> 00:11:53.861
Are you all right? I thought
you said you feel better.

00:11:53.894 --> 00:11:55.296
I'm fine, just...

00:11:55.329 --> 00:11:58.102
I dunno. My body still feels
a little weak for some reason.

00:11:58.135 --> 00:11:59.271
That's weird...

00:11:59.304 --> 00:12:01.041
I mean, was that supposed
to get me back to the level

00:12:01.075 --> 00:12:02.712
I was at before the fight?

00:12:02.745 --> 00:12:05.116
A Fullheal didn't
fully heal you?

00:12:05.149 --> 00:12:06.151
Are you serious?

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:07.555
Uh, I guess so.

00:12:07.588 --> 00:12:08.857
But, hey...

00:12:08.891 --> 00:12:10.695
I do feel better than after
I conjured that Doruora.

00:12:10.728 --> 00:12:12.030
What are you talking about?

00:12:12.063 --> 00:12:13.399
That means you've
only recovered

00:12:13.433 --> 00:12:14.769
what you would
have naturally.

00:12:14.802 --> 00:12:16.105
The spell didn't do a thing.

00:12:16.138 --> 00:12:17.809
To have a
Fullheal cast on you

00:12:17.842 --> 00:12:21.081
and not fully recover your
stamina - it's impossible.

00:12:22.451 --> 00:12:24.823
Wait. I take that back.

00:12:24.856 --> 00:12:26.258
It is possible...

00:12:26.292 --> 00:12:26.960
Huh?

00:12:26.993 --> 00:12:28.664
Hyunckel mentioned it earlier.

00:12:28.697 --> 00:12:30.266
Damage that comes
from Dark Aura attacks

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.972
can't be repaired with
Healing-type magic...

00:12:33.005 --> 00:12:35.711
Maybe damage from
Draconic Aura...

00:12:35.745 --> 00:12:38.717
can't be undone
using spells either.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:40.420
In which case,
if the rebound from your

00:12:40.453 --> 00:12:42.792
double Doruora left
you with any injuries,

00:12:42.825 --> 00:12:44.161
I can't patch them up.

00:12:44.194 --> 00:12:46.899
Even my best spells can't
do anything to change that.

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:49.038
There must be
something we can do.

00:12:49.071 --> 00:12:50.875
Well, on the bright side...

00:12:50.908 --> 00:12:53.079
at least we've already
defeated Vearn.

00:12:53.112 --> 00:12:55.149
I think either we let
you heal naturally,

00:12:55.183 --> 00:12:58.823
or keep throwing Fullheals at
you until one of them sticks.

00:12:58.857 --> 00:13:01.361
You might even have
to retire, Hero.

00:13:01.395 --> 00:13:04.334
Retirement really isn't what
I had in mind right now.

00:13:04.368 --> 00:13:06.640
Hey, there's no need
rush it right now.

00:13:06.673 --> 00:13:08.844
Mystvearn might
be strong, but relax.

00:13:08.878 --> 00:13:10.548
There's no way that
he's stronger than

00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:11.849
the Dark King himself.

00:13:11.883 --> 00:13:13.887
If Larhart and the
others have all teamed up

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.260
to take him on
together, they're fine.

00:13:17.293 --> 00:13:20.333
Getting you back to full power
should be our top priority.

00:13:20.367 --> 00:13:22.905
Besides, until we do,
we won't be much help.

00:13:22.939 --> 00:13:24.676
And we should be prepared.

00:13:24.709 --> 00:13:26.946
As a matter of fact,
if you go like this,

00:13:26.979 --> 00:13:28.850
all you'll do is
get in their way.

00:13:28.883 --> 00:13:32.490
Gee, thanks. You sure know
how to cheer a guy up.

00:13:32.525 --> 00:13:35.997
Dai: But I guess that bluntness
is what makes you so reliable.

00:13:36.498 --> 00:13:37.668
"Reliable"?!

00:13:37.701 --> 00:13:39.572
What kind of
compliment is that?

00:13:39.606 --> 00:13:42.143
[laughing]

00:13:46.452 --> 00:13:48.389
Dai [thought]: If
it's really over...

00:13:48.423 --> 00:13:51.863
then why do I still feel
this trembling in my heart?

00:13:51.896 --> 00:13:55.236
I... I have... this
terrible feeling...

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:57.908
that something bad
is going to happen.

00:13:59.812 --> 00:14:01.248
Popp: No way...

00:14:01.282 --> 00:14:04.622
You really expect us to believe
that you're stronger than Vearn?

00:14:04.656 --> 00:14:06.492
Don't be ridiculous.

00:14:06.526 --> 00:14:07.928
What are you saying...

00:14:07.961 --> 00:14:09.866
That the big boss
of the Dark Army

00:14:09.899 --> 00:14:12.103
has actually been
you all along?

00:14:12.137 --> 00:14:15.209
That you rank
above your own king?

00:14:16.647 --> 00:14:19.451
Say something, pasty-face!

00:14:19.484 --> 00:14:20.788
What is there to say?

00:14:20.821 --> 00:14:22.124
With your meager intellect,

00:14:22.157 --> 00:14:24.896
even if I explained my
relationship with the Dark King,

00:14:24.929 --> 00:14:26.465
you wouldn't understand.

00:14:26.499 --> 00:14:28.603
But the answer to
your first question

00:14:28.637 --> 00:14:30.707
is easy enough to grasp...

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.312
Believe it or not,
you are correct.

00:14:33.345 --> 00:14:36.084
Then... You mean,
you're really...

00:14:36.118 --> 00:14:38.923
Maam [thought]: If it's true...
If he's as strong as he says...

00:14:38.957 --> 00:14:42.030
That means his power is
beyond human comprehension.

00:14:42.064 --> 00:14:44.835
And if it's greater than
Vearn's, we're no match.

00:14:44.869 --> 00:14:47.407
You should be grateful
to die in such a way.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.179
Some live centuries and
experience little...

00:14:50.213 --> 00:14:51.381
Consider yourselves lucky

00:14:51.415 --> 00:14:53.920
to witness the might
of my true form.

00:14:53.954 --> 00:14:57.961
This gift of death is
far beyond what you deserve.

00:14:59.131 --> 00:15:00.500
Hym [thought]:
Nothing is working.

00:15:00.534 --> 00:15:02.370
Larhart [thought]: But no
matter what he thinks,

00:15:02.403 --> 00:15:04.508
we're not going
down without a fight.

00:15:06.378 --> 00:15:08.215
Crocodine [thought]: It may
seem as if we're powerless

00:15:08.249 --> 00:15:09.952
against him like this....

00:15:09.986 --> 00:15:12.758
but if we can slow him
down enough to attack...

00:15:12.792 --> 00:15:13.893
Hyunckel [thought]:
We still have

00:15:13.927 --> 00:15:15.630
one last option
up our sleeve.

00:15:21.643 --> 00:15:23.312
All [thought]: Medroa!

00:15:25.951 --> 00:15:27.454
Popp [thought]: I feel
a very uncomfortable

00:15:27.487 --> 00:15:29.992
amount of expectation
on my shoulders...

00:15:30.026 --> 00:15:32.631
Talk about pressure.

00:15:32.665 --> 00:15:36.038
If I cast the spell head on,
he might deflect it...

00:15:36.071 --> 00:15:37.841
And in that case, I'm toast.

00:15:37.875 --> 00:15:39.812
But he ain't exactly
slow either...

00:15:39.846 --> 00:15:41.750
I'll have to
time this just right.

00:15:41.783 --> 00:15:43.151
Hey...

00:15:43.185 --> 00:15:46.324
I think I've got an idea.
Heal me so I can fight again.

00:15:46.358 --> 00:15:48.128
I'll get him in
a hold and make sure

00:15:48.161 --> 00:15:49.899
he can't worm
his way out of it.

00:15:49.933 --> 00:15:51.903
As soon as I've got
him in the open,

00:15:51.937 --> 00:15:54.174
hit him with that big
spell of yours. Got it?

00:15:54.208 --> 00:15:55.309
No... I couldn't...

00:15:55.342 --> 00:15:56.579
Don't be stupid.

00:15:56.612 --> 00:15:58.248
There's no time to argue here.

00:15:58.282 --> 00:16:01.556
Can't you see? If it's
either me or everybody else.

00:16:01.589 --> 00:16:03.158
You mustn't hesitate.

00:16:16.352 --> 00:16:18.590
Mystvearn: You still aren't
ready to give up the fight?

00:16:18.623 --> 00:16:21.428
I'll give you this:
Your bravery is commendable.

00:16:21.462 --> 00:16:23.499
Even against my
overwhelming power,

00:16:23.533 --> 00:16:26.506
none of you have
lost a shred of hope.

00:16:26.539 --> 00:16:28.008
With resolve like that,

00:16:28.042 --> 00:16:31.782
I can see how you once
survived facing King Vearn.

00:16:39.632 --> 00:16:41.001
Now that's more like it.

00:16:41.034 --> 00:16:43.172
Time for your
finishing move, Mage.

00:16:43.205 --> 00:16:45.476
Don't forget what I
told you, all right?

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:46.747
Let him have it.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:47.781
We're not playing chess.

00:16:47.815 --> 00:16:49.217
You may be a
metallic life form...

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:51.656
But... I can't sacrifice you.

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:53.794
Everything is chess, Popp.

00:16:53.827 --> 00:16:55.130
If you don't make this move,

00:16:55.163 --> 00:16:57.334
you and that girl
you love are finished.

00:16:57.367 --> 00:16:59.806
If my life is all
it costs to spare you,

00:16:59.839 --> 00:17:00.874
consider it a bargain.

00:17:00.908 --> 00:17:02.811
W-Wh... Why does
a random enemy -

00:17:02.845 --> 00:17:03.980
or reformed enemy -

00:17:04.013 --> 00:17:06.218
know so much about
my love life?

00:17:06.251 --> 00:17:08.455
Hym [thought]: Buddy,
it's pretty obvious.

00:17:08.488 --> 00:17:11.328
Both of you, quit squabbling.
You need to focus.

00:17:11.361 --> 00:17:14.067
We're counting on you.
Don't let us down.

00:17:16.171 --> 00:17:17.574
Popp: Everyone...

00:17:18.643 --> 00:17:20.714
There you have it. Let's go.

00:17:20.748 --> 00:17:22.652
Larhart [thought]:
I don't know exactly what

00:17:22.685 --> 00:17:23.787
these two are planning,

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:27.026
but if it's a gamble,
then I want in on the action.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:28.028
Here goes.

00:17:28.062 --> 00:17:29.766
Prepare yourself
for round two!

00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:31.101
As for the rest of you,

00:17:31.134 --> 00:17:33.372
keep your distance and
wait for the right moment.

00:17:33.406 --> 00:17:35.744
Stick to ranged
attacks. Understood?

00:17:52.377 --> 00:17:53.646
Whoa...

00:17:53.679 --> 00:17:56.853
Even when Larhart and Hym go
at him at the same time...

00:17:56.886 --> 00:17:58.422
They aren't landing any hits.

00:17:59.692 --> 00:18:02.430
Hym [thought]: No, it's not that
our attacks aren't landing...

00:18:04.134 --> 00:18:05.837
Larhart [thought]:
It's just like before...

00:18:05.871 --> 00:18:08.876
Some of these strikes are
definitely hitting their mark...

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:10.112
And yet...

00:18:11.247 --> 00:18:13.954
Damnit! If that's the case...

00:18:13.987 --> 00:18:16.358
Then how about this?!

00:18:17.828 --> 00:18:20.199
[pained cry]

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.612
I can't cast
Medroa that quick...

00:18:27.581 --> 00:18:28.716
No, no...

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:31.722
He's so strong I can't
even hold him in place.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:46.284
[roaring]

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.038
Crocodine [thought]: My Beast
King Indomitable Blast

00:18:56.071 --> 00:18:58.275
isn't even slowing him down?

00:19:03.051 --> 00:19:04.420
No - Crocodine!

00:19:07.861 --> 00:19:09.431
That was close! Are you okay?

00:19:09.464 --> 00:19:10.567
Yeah.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.840
Thanks for that. I never
expected to be saved by a rat.

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:18.115
Hyunckel [thought]:If only
I could move more freely...

00:19:18.148 --> 00:19:19.852
If only I could fight.

00:19:21.421 --> 00:19:23.225
Popp [thought]:
He's just too strong.

00:19:23.258 --> 00:19:24.829
I hate to
disappoint everybody,

00:19:24.862 --> 00:19:28.803
but we just lost our only shot
at using Medroa against him!

00:19:29.839 --> 00:19:31.375
He doesn't look that bad.

00:19:31.408 --> 00:19:32.711
He what?

00:19:32.744 --> 00:19:36.151
Are you seriously admiring his
looks at a time like this?!

00:19:36.184 --> 00:19:38.055
You've always had
a thing for bad boys,

00:19:38.089 --> 00:19:39.592
but this is a little far.

00:19:39.625 --> 00:19:40.694
I mean, come on.

00:19:40.727 --> 00:19:42.831
That's not what I
meant, you dumb-dumb.

00:19:42.865 --> 00:19:44.033
What I'm saying is,

00:19:44.067 --> 00:19:46.773
he's taken an unbelievable
beating - even with the mask.

00:19:46.806 --> 00:19:50.013
I know I hit him square in the
face with my Refractor Fist,

00:19:50.046 --> 00:19:51.282
but just look at him...

00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:53.686
There's not a bruise
or a scratch on him.

00:19:53.719 --> 00:19:54.488
How can that be?

00:19:54.522 --> 00:19:56.291
Popp: You're right.
I dunno...

00:19:56.325 --> 00:19:57.895
Maybe it's some
kind of magic.

00:19:57.928 --> 00:19:59.097
Mr. Beast: Maam.

00:19:59.131 --> 00:20:00.667
Maam: Grand Master?!

00:20:00.701 --> 00:20:04.440
Mr. Beast: No, no. Right
now I'm still Mr. Beast.

00:20:04.474 --> 00:20:05.142
Huh?

00:20:05.175 --> 00:20:06.779
Wait a minute. Is this guy...

00:20:06.812 --> 00:20:09.117
Mr. Beast: It's hardly
important right now.

00:20:09.151 --> 00:20:10.587
Is this true, Maam?

00:20:10.621 --> 00:20:13.158
Are you sure you hit him in the
face with your Refractor Fist?

00:20:13.192 --> 00:20:14.294
Yes.

00:20:14.327 --> 00:20:16.599
Mr. Beast: I see.
Yes, that must be it...

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:18.102
I believe I've just uncovered

00:20:18.135 --> 00:20:21.676
the secret of
Mystvearn's immortality.

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:23.179
Mr. Beast: Immortal
and indestructible

00:20:23.212 --> 00:20:24.247
are different things.

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.151
Mystvearn may be
immune to damage,

00:20:26.185 --> 00:20:28.890
but the Refractor Fist
has given his game away.

00:20:28.923 --> 00:20:30.192
As you know, it overcharges

00:20:30.225 --> 00:20:31.896
an opponent's
biological functions.

00:20:31.929 --> 00:20:34.267
Any living creature
who took a direct hit

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.138
would be left with
some sort of mark.

00:20:36.171 --> 00:20:38.777
There's only one explanation.

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:40.547
He isn't alive at all.

00:20:40.581 --> 00:20:45.691
Since he has no biological
functions, he remains unscathed.

00:20:45.724 --> 00:20:46.324
Both: What?!

00:20:46.358 --> 00:20:47.594
Mr. Beast: Fear not, Popp.

00:20:47.627 --> 00:20:50.333
I will give you a chance
to cast your Medroa spell.

00:20:50.366 --> 00:20:52.270
H-Hang on. Are you
out of your mind?

00:20:52.303 --> 00:20:54.609
Mr. Beast:
Depends who you ask.

00:20:54.642 --> 00:20:56.512
Mr. Beast: Now, as
I'm sure you remember,

00:20:56.545 --> 00:21:00.285
I suffer from a rather nasty
case of Glossy Ankleitis.

00:21:00.319 --> 00:21:02.691
I can't fight for long
before it starts flaring up,

00:21:02.724 --> 00:21:05.029
so make good use
of this chance...

00:21:05.062 --> 00:21:07.133
Because you won't
get another!

00:21:07.166 --> 00:21:08.269
Popp [thought]:
Didn't Brokeena's illness

00:21:08.302 --> 00:21:10.339
have something to
do with his butt?

00:21:10.941 --> 00:21:12.043
Forget about that.

00:21:12.076 --> 00:21:14.815
Ankles and butts are the
least of my worries right now.

00:21:21.394 --> 00:21:22.631
What's this?

00:21:22.664 --> 00:21:25.637
Sending a clown to buy
time for the rest of you?

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:27.373
Mr. Beast: Funny
you mention time,

00:21:27.407 --> 00:21:29.444
because the key to
your immortality...

00:21:29.478 --> 00:21:31.749
Must be none other than...

00:21:36.491 --> 00:21:39.898
the Secret Spell
of Frozen Time.

00:21:46.946 --> 00:21:49.651
How do you know about
the Secret Spell?

00:21:53.325 --> 00:21:56.799
You're not a clown...
so just who are you?

00:22:00.473 --> 00:22:03.980
Mr. Beast: Please...
call me Mr. Beast.

00:23:36.999 --> 00:23:39.070
Narrator: Now that Brokeena
has deduced the reason for

00:23:39.104 --> 00:23:41.742
Mystvearn's seemingly
indestructible form...

00:23:41.775 --> 00:23:44.882
He uses his agile moves to hold
their adversary's attention

00:23:44.915 --> 00:23:48.488
while Popp searches for the
window to unleash his Medroa.

00:23:48.522 --> 00:23:49.858
But has the
wizened grandmaster

00:23:49.892 --> 00:23:51.930
unveiled all of
Mystvearn's secrets?

00:23:51.963 --> 00:23:53.733
And will Popp's spell
be powerful enough

00:23:53.766 --> 00:23:56.438
to overcome the mightiest
being in the Underworld?

00:23:56.471 --> 00:23:58.743
