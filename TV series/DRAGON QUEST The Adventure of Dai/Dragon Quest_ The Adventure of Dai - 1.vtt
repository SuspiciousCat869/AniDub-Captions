WEBVTT

00:00:21.777 --> 00:00:23.446
Avan: Getting tired, Hadlar?

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:25.952
Hadlar: Insolent fool...

00:00:25.986 --> 00:00:28.724
I will be your doom!

00:00:31.897 --> 00:00:33.399
[attacking yell]

00:00:38.076 --> 00:00:40.715
Dark King Vearn:
So, a measly Hero

00:00:40.748 --> 00:00:43.019
vanquished the Dark Lord...

00:00:43.053 --> 00:00:45.725
There's really no
telling what these humans

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:48.029
are capable of, is there?

00:00:48.062 --> 00:00:51.536
[amused chuckle]

00:00:55.244 --> 00:00:57.415
General Baran: Just who
do you think you are?

00:00:57.448 --> 00:01:00.187
She was innocent.
Get out of here. Be gone...

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.093
You miserable humans!

00:01:03.126 --> 00:01:07.367
[explosion]

00:01:20.728 --> 00:01:29.045
Baby Dai: [crying]

00:01:29.078 --> 00:01:30.080
[curious grunt]

00:01:30.113 --> 00:01:31.550
[crying]

00:01:31.584 --> 00:01:32.920
Brass: Who are you?

00:01:32.953 --> 00:01:34.656
[crying]

00:03:41.677 --> 00:03:44.148
Here comes Dai;
the brand-new Hero!

00:03:44.181 --> 00:03:45.585
[chuckling]

00:03:45.618 --> 00:03:48.691
Dai: C'mon, gang. This island's
not going to defend itself!

00:03:48.724 --> 00:03:49.626
[surprised gasp]

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.663
You little fool!

00:03:51.696 --> 00:03:52.865
[pained groan]

00:03:54.202 --> 00:03:57.140
Aw, come on. What was
that for, Grampa Brass?

00:03:57.174 --> 00:03:59.412
Quit wasting your time
with this make believe,

00:03:59.445 --> 00:04:02.184
and get to work
practicing your spells!

00:04:02.217 --> 00:04:03.554
[reluctant groan]

00:04:03.587 --> 00:04:06.492
Brass: How many more years
will it be until you get it?

00:04:06.526 --> 00:04:08.263
If you can't even cast a spell,

00:04:08.296 --> 00:04:10.768
then you'll never
defend the island.

00:04:13.407 --> 00:04:15.578
[disheartened sigh]

00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:18.249
Dai: It doesn't make
any sense, Gomechan.

00:04:18.282 --> 00:04:19.653
Grampa Brass
was the one who

00:04:19.687 --> 00:04:21.923
told me the legend
in the first place.

00:04:24.563 --> 00:04:26.967
In the days of darkness,
a noble swordsman

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.375
called the Hero stood against
Lord Hadlar's evil kingdom.

00:04:31.408 --> 00:04:32.879
With his companions
by his side,

00:04:32.913 --> 00:04:36.821
he defeated the darkness
and saved the entire world.

00:04:36.854 --> 00:04:38.089
And because of that...

00:04:38.123 --> 00:04:41.295
Brass: Every monster under the
Dark Lord's spell was released.

00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:42.899
So we all came out here to

00:04:42.932 --> 00:04:45.404
Dermline Island to
live peaceful lives and

00:04:45.437 --> 00:04:48.209
never bother the
human kingdoms again.

00:04:48.243 --> 00:04:50.113
Brass: We're changed
thanks to him.

00:04:50.146 --> 00:04:52.350
I wanna be a Hero
when I grow up!

00:04:52.384 --> 00:04:55.958
Nonsense, Dai. You will
be a brilliant Mage like me.

00:04:55.992 --> 00:04:59.065
Brass: Maybe one day the
Hero will ask you for help.

00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:00.433
[sigh]

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:03.507
Grampa only says that
because he's a mage...

00:05:04.976 --> 00:05:06.479
But I want to be a Hero.

00:05:06.513 --> 00:05:09.085
It's just so much better
than anything else.

00:05:09.118 --> 00:05:10.353
[squeak]

00:05:10.855 --> 00:05:12.190
[excited squeaks]

00:05:12.223 --> 00:05:14.328
You think so too,
right, Gomechan?

00:05:14.361 --> 00:05:17.134
-[excited squeaks]
-[laughing]

00:05:17.167 --> 00:05:19.606
You always understand,
don't you?

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.610
[laughing]

00:05:23.312 --> 00:05:24.949
Dai: A big ship!

00:05:30.294 --> 00:05:32.431
No way...
A real-live Hero?

00:05:32.464 --> 00:05:34.536
I can't believe it -
what's he doing here?

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:37.007
I can't just sit here -
I'm gonna meet him.

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:39.846
[whistling]

00:05:42.652 --> 00:05:44.756
You sit tight.
I'll go see what's up.

00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:52.437
Okay, Merman; we've gotta get
out to that ship, right away!

00:05:53.674 --> 00:05:56.780
Wow, I can't believe
I'm about to meet a Hero.

00:05:57.882 --> 00:06:00.386
I must say, for an island
infested with monsters,

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.258
it's surprisingly idyllic.

00:06:02.291 --> 00:06:03.593
Well, they've all gone soft

00:06:03.627 --> 00:06:05.632
since the Dark Lord
was defeated.

00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:08.269
All we have to do is
knock them around a little

00:06:08.303 --> 00:06:10.440
and pick up
King Romos's prize...

00:06:10.474 --> 00:06:13.146
This might be the world's
easiest paycheck.

00:06:13.179 --> 00:06:16.854
Money's great, but I'd
clobber these things for free.

00:06:16.887 --> 00:06:17.789
Masopho: [amused cackle]

00:06:17.822 --> 00:06:19.960
Well, I'm glad you're
not in charge...

00:06:19.993 --> 00:06:22.565
And this isn't an
extermination mission.

00:06:22.598 --> 00:06:25.003
Just because we're hunting
the Golden Metal Slime

00:06:25.037 --> 00:06:28.210
doesn't mean we can't
have a little fun, as well.

00:06:28.243 --> 00:06:30.515
You really think it exists?

00:06:30.548 --> 00:06:31.282
Deroline: What's that?

00:06:31.315 --> 00:06:32.317
[noticing grunts]

00:06:32.351 --> 00:06:33.486
Heroh Heroh: Merman!

00:06:33.521 --> 00:06:35.557
Zulbon: Is that
a kid riding it?

00:06:40.535 --> 00:06:43.740
Wow. Hi...
I knew it was you!

00:06:47.113 --> 00:06:48.482
[amazed breath]

00:06:49.484 --> 00:06:50.955
[curious grunts]

00:06:50.989 --> 00:06:52.892
So, are you really a Hero?

00:06:55.698 --> 00:06:56.833
Why, of course he is.

00:06:56.866 --> 00:06:59.773
And we're his
famous companions.

00:06:59.806 --> 00:07:01.009
Awesome!

00:07:01.042 --> 00:07:02.646
Who are you, little boy?

00:07:02.679 --> 00:07:05.017
I'm Dai! It's an honor.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.352
And you live on that Island?

00:07:06.386 --> 00:07:07.254
Dai: Mhmm!

00:07:07.287 --> 00:07:08.390
Zulbon: Are the legends true?

00:07:08.423 --> 00:07:10.494
Is it really full
of terrifying creatures?

00:07:10.528 --> 00:07:11.763
Dai: They're not terrifying.

00:07:11.797 --> 00:07:13.701
Some of them are
my best friends!

00:07:13.734 --> 00:07:15.036
I see...

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:18.209
Zulbon: Do you think
you could introduce us?

00:07:21.617 --> 00:07:23.721
You mean, you wanna
meet all of them?

00:07:23.754 --> 00:07:26.225
We've been hired by
the king to travel around

00:07:26.258 --> 00:07:28.730
and make sure that people
aren't mistreating monsters

00:07:28.764 --> 00:07:30.366
now that they're
all free-willed.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.737
We'll still need
to look around,

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:36.246
but it's easier if you
can bring them all to us.

00:07:36.279 --> 00:07:38.150
So. Will you help us?

00:07:38.183 --> 00:07:39.886
Absolutely! Watch this.

00:07:42.257 --> 00:07:45.698
[whistling]

00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:48.571
The assembly whistle -
what's that boy up to now?

00:07:48.604 --> 00:07:50.941
[excited roaring]

00:07:57.154 --> 00:08:05.069
[excited roaring]

00:08:06.539 --> 00:08:08.209
[nervous grunts]

00:08:08.242 --> 00:08:10.547
Now, Dai...
is this everybody?

00:08:10.581 --> 00:08:13.152
Sure! Well... I think so.

00:08:13.186 --> 00:08:14.088
What about these Slimes...

00:08:14.121 --> 00:08:16.793
You're not hiding
a golden one, are you?

00:08:17.528 --> 00:08:19.999
Oh... You mean Gomechan!

00:08:20.033 --> 00:08:21.169
Gome-who?

00:08:21.202 --> 00:08:22.003
It's his nickname!

00:08:22.037 --> 00:08:23.774
I think he's
supposed to be called

00:08:23.807 --> 00:08:25.076
a Golden
Something-or-Other,

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.515
but that's a kind of
a mouthful, right?

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:29.251
All: That's the one!

00:08:29.284 --> 00:08:30.521
[confused grunt]

00:08:30.554 --> 00:08:32.925
Zulbon: We would love to
meet such a rare creature.

00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.096
He's pretty shy
around new people,

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:36.734
but I can try asking him?

00:08:36.767 --> 00:08:37.300
Hang on!

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.811
Hey! Come on, everyone.
Settle down.

00:08:42.845 --> 00:08:46.285
Whoa, I didn't realize there
were any Lump Shamans left.

00:08:47.254 --> 00:08:48.957
And who might you be?

00:08:48.991 --> 00:08:52.030
I'm Deroline, the Hero.
And these are my companions.

00:08:52.063 --> 00:08:53.265
A new Hero?!

00:08:55.003 --> 00:08:58.611
I don't buy it. In fact,
I think I smell evil.

00:08:58.644 --> 00:09:00.380
You're not welcome here.

00:09:00.413 --> 00:09:02.283
Let's show this geezer.

00:09:05.758 --> 00:09:06.726
[nervous squeaks]

00:09:06.759 --> 00:09:07.929
Dai: C'mon,
what's your problem?

00:09:07.962 --> 00:09:09.899
Don't you want to meet a Hero?

00:09:10.634 --> 00:09:11.435
What was that?

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:13.907
[fighting grunts]

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:14.876
[worried breath]

00:09:17.147 --> 00:09:18.282
Take this!

00:09:20.186 --> 00:09:21.355
Now, Crack!

00:09:26.099 --> 00:09:27.334
But, why?

00:09:27.368 --> 00:09:29.605
[frightened whimper]

00:09:31.175 --> 00:09:33.814
That's enough!

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:37.020
Dai, get out of here!

00:09:37.053 --> 00:09:38.322
Dai: Grampa!

00:09:38.355 --> 00:09:41.262
[fleeing cries]

00:09:41.295 --> 00:09:42.263
[nervous grunt]

00:09:42.899 --> 00:09:44.802
Excellent work, little boy.

00:09:46.039 --> 00:09:46.707
Hey!

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.710
And here's your reward.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.114
Woosh!

00:09:53.352 --> 00:09:54.288
[chuckling]

00:09:54.321 --> 00:09:55.389
Dai...

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:02.204
And now to clean up our mess
before we get out of here.

00:10:02.237 --> 00:10:03.674
Hurry! Get down.

00:10:03.707 --> 00:10:05.076
Deroline: Boom!

00:10:09.117 --> 00:10:12.257
[explosion]

00:10:14.563 --> 00:10:16.633
Brass: Those scoundrels...

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:17.635
[amused chuckle]

00:10:17.669 --> 00:10:19.305
That was almost too easy.

00:10:19.338 --> 00:10:20.474
[whimpering]

00:10:20.508 --> 00:10:22.579
Talk about striking gold.
Right, fellas?

00:10:22.612 --> 00:10:24.247
The look on their faces!

00:10:24.281 --> 00:10:27.221
[cackling]

00:10:27.254 --> 00:10:30.093
How could a Hero do
something so awful?

00:10:30.127 --> 00:10:31.061
I don't understand.

00:10:31.095 --> 00:10:33.867
Gomechan's never
hurt anybody!

00:10:33.901 --> 00:10:35.972
Brass: He was some
kind of imposter...

00:10:36.005 --> 00:10:39.078
A true Hero would
never be so cruel.

00:10:39.111 --> 00:10:40.347
Dai: He's a fake?

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.019
Grampa, we can't let them
get away with our friend.

00:10:43.052 --> 00:10:45.156
Well, if you're planning
to win this fight,

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:46.726
take these with you.

00:10:47.493 --> 00:10:49.331
What are they?

00:10:49.365 --> 00:10:50.968
Brass: They're
Magic Cylinders.

00:10:51.001 --> 00:10:53.674
But I can't even cast
a spell, remember?

00:10:53.707 --> 00:10:54.876
Who could forget?

00:10:54.909 --> 00:10:57.682
But don't worry.
They're already enchanted.

00:10:57.715 --> 00:10:59.819
Even a human could use them.

00:10:59.853 --> 00:11:01.288
Brass: If you say "Gulp",

00:11:01.322 --> 00:11:04.161
the Cylinder will capture any
living thing you point it at.

00:11:04.194 --> 00:11:07.802
Then they'll be trapped in
there until you say "Gush".

00:11:07.835 --> 00:11:09.673
Now you still need
a plan of attack,

00:11:09.706 --> 00:11:11.910
and some reinforcements
wouldn't hurt.

00:11:11.943 --> 00:11:15.049
The Dark Lord himself
gave me these two.

00:11:15.083 --> 00:11:17.689
Whatever's inside should
be free from his spell now.

00:11:17.722 --> 00:11:19.057
But I still shudder to think

00:11:19.091 --> 00:11:20.628
what sort of
creature he'd catch...

00:11:20.661 --> 00:11:21.462
Let's try Gulp.

00:11:21.495 --> 00:11:22.898
So don't mess around-

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.002
Whoa! Gush.

00:11:26.272 --> 00:11:28.475
-Knock it off, you little-
-Gulp again!

00:11:29.277 --> 00:11:30.479
And then Gush...

00:11:31.516 --> 00:11:33.486
-I just told you-
-One more Gulp!

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.427
Cool! Okay.
Grampa's a start...

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.331
But who else?

00:11:39.364 --> 00:11:42.103
If there's anyone out
there who can still fight,

00:11:42.137 --> 00:11:43.072
come out!

00:11:43.105 --> 00:11:45.076
[whistling]

00:11:45.611 --> 00:11:47.180
[roaring]

00:11:47.213 --> 00:11:48.048
[whistling]

00:11:48.082 --> 00:11:49.451
[roaring]

00:11:50.453 --> 00:11:51.389
[whistling]

00:11:51.422 --> 00:11:52.357
[screeching]

00:11:53.026 --> 00:11:54.829
Let's go.

00:12:07.655 --> 00:12:09.091
King Romos: Welcome back...

00:12:09.124 --> 00:12:11.228
Glad to see you're
all in one piece.

00:12:11.261 --> 00:12:13.199
King Romos.

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:16.138
So, tell me.
Are the rumors really true?

00:12:16.171 --> 00:12:18.076
Is Dermline Island
a teeming hive

00:12:18.109 --> 00:12:20.113
full of horrible
beasts like they say?

00:12:20.147 --> 00:12:20.747
Yes.

00:12:20.781 --> 00:12:21.984
From the moment we landed

00:12:22.017 --> 00:12:24.689
it was an endless assault
of claws and fangs,

00:12:24.723 --> 00:12:26.359
and even tentacles.

00:12:26.392 --> 00:12:27.595
Deroline: But together,

00:12:27.628 --> 00:12:30.667
we managed to wipe out every
single one of those creatures.

00:12:30.701 --> 00:12:33.072
[impressed chatter]

00:12:33.106 --> 00:12:34.809
Deroline: And while
we were at it,

00:12:34.843 --> 00:12:36.913
we also captured
a very rare Slime...

00:12:36.947 --> 00:12:39.785
In fact, there's only
one in the whole world.

00:12:39.819 --> 00:12:42.992
You might call it
a monster fit for a king.

00:12:43.994 --> 00:12:46.465
Have you brought me
a gift, Deroline?

00:12:48.803 --> 00:12:50.239
How magnificent!

00:12:50.273 --> 00:12:52.678
They call it the
Golden Metal Slime.

00:12:52.712 --> 00:12:54.782
You'll be the envy
of every other king.

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:57.688
It's a living jewel,
Your Majesty.

00:12:57.721 --> 00:12:59.892
King Romos:
Truly extraordinary.

00:12:59.926 --> 00:13:01.763
Excellent work, Deroline!

00:13:01.796 --> 00:13:04.669
I daresay you've outdone
yourself this time.

00:13:04.702 --> 00:13:07.675
You have earned your
reward, young warrior.

00:13:07.708 --> 00:13:10.814
I shall present you
the Crown of Champions.

00:13:10.847 --> 00:13:13.553
King Romos: You're the
Romos Kingdom's new Hero!

00:13:14.522 --> 00:13:16.726
Dai: [roaring]

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.463
King Romos: What was that?

00:13:18.496 --> 00:13:19.799
Deroline: It can't be...

00:13:19.832 --> 00:13:21.903
[battle cry]

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:28.850
You give me back Gomechan!

00:13:30.688 --> 00:13:31.856
Gomechan?

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:34.929
Dai: Yeah, he's my
Golden Something-or-Other.

00:13:34.963 --> 00:13:36.566
You should take cover,
King Romos.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.102
He may look like
an innocent kid,

00:13:38.135 --> 00:13:41.743
but I've seen him summon
an army of vicious creatures.

00:13:41.776 --> 00:13:44.180
My friends aren't
vicious. You are!

00:13:44.214 --> 00:13:45.651
They were just
defending themselves

00:13:45.684 --> 00:13:48.188
after you attacked
us for no reason.

00:13:48.957 --> 00:13:50.961
Dai: You'll regret it!

00:13:51.295 --> 00:13:52.230
Gush!

00:13:54.168 --> 00:13:55.671
[roaring]

00:13:55.704 --> 00:13:57.742
[panicked cries]

00:13:57.775 --> 00:13:59.477
[angry squawking]

00:13:59.512 --> 00:14:00.479
Dai: Gush!

00:14:00.514 --> 00:14:01.749
[roaring]

00:14:01.783 --> 00:14:02.450
Dai: Gush!

00:14:02.484 --> 00:14:04.154
[growling]

00:14:04.188 --> 00:14:05.423
Dai: Gush!

00:14:05.456 --> 00:14:07.862
[dizzy cries]

00:14:07.895 --> 00:14:10.634
Actually, I think
you'll regret it.

00:14:14.775 --> 00:14:16.747
Everyone; hang onto something!

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.584
[whistling]

00:14:18.617 --> 00:14:19.652
[confused grunts]

00:14:19.685 --> 00:14:22.423
[falling yells]

00:14:24.394 --> 00:14:27.434
How's that? Attacks
from land, air and sea,

00:14:27.467 --> 00:14:29.237
all hitting you at once!

00:14:30.106 --> 00:14:32.310
You're still going down!

00:14:32.343 --> 00:14:35.149
[falling cries]

00:14:35.183 --> 00:14:36.953
[roaring]

00:14:40.193 --> 00:14:41.228
Frizz!

00:14:45.336 --> 00:14:46.606
Stay back!

00:14:53.887 --> 00:14:55.590
[battle cry]

00:15:01.703 --> 00:15:03.206
[snarling]

00:15:03.239 --> 00:15:06.344
Masopho - let's
put that squid on ice!

00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:08.483
Woosh!

00:15:08.517 --> 00:15:09.652
Crack!

00:15:15.063 --> 00:15:17.166
Zulbon: This is it!
We've got 'em now.

00:15:19.271 --> 00:15:20.372
Frizz!

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.082
Frizz!

00:15:26.619 --> 00:15:27.621
Crack!

00:15:30.492 --> 00:15:33.499
[nervous cries]

00:15:33.533 --> 00:15:35.269
[screaming]

00:15:35.971 --> 00:15:37.608
[battle cry]

00:15:37.641 --> 00:15:38.676
Boom!

00:15:40.781 --> 00:15:41.983
Deroline: Stupid creature!

00:15:42.017 --> 00:15:43.820
Why you...

00:15:43.854 --> 00:15:45.858
Deroline: You're no
match for a Hero!

00:15:45.891 --> 00:15:46.893
Dai: What Hero?

00:15:46.927 --> 00:15:48.095
You're just a thief
who kidnapped

00:15:48.129 --> 00:15:50.199
my friend for some crown.

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:54.007
That's enough!

00:15:57.314 --> 00:15:59.017
Dai!

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:01.556
Don't you think
you're a little busy?

00:16:02.925 --> 00:16:06.031
I have had more than
enough of you, kid.

00:16:06.867 --> 00:16:09.638
[wincing]

00:16:11.976 --> 00:16:13.713
Use the Gold Cylinders!

00:16:13.747 --> 00:16:16.384
Hurry up, Dai!
Open them both!

00:16:20.359 --> 00:16:20.794
Gush!

00:16:20.827 --> 00:16:23.232
[squeaking]

00:16:23.266 --> 00:16:26.305
Whoa... That is a lot
of Slimes in one tube.

00:16:26.338 --> 00:16:30.045
Well, it's too bad these useless
things can't even fight.

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:33.085
And Gush!

00:16:38.429 --> 00:16:40.499
[screaming]

00:16:42.972 --> 00:16:43.707
A... d-d-d-

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:44.943
Deroline: Dragon?!

00:16:44.976 --> 00:16:46.646
[roar]

00:16:47.447 --> 00:16:48.583
[screaming]

00:16:51.388 --> 00:16:52.558
Woosh!

00:16:54.194 --> 00:16:55.463
Dai: Nice going, Dragon!

00:16:55.496 --> 00:16:58.436
Let's teach that
imposter a lesson!

00:16:58.469 --> 00:17:00.540
[whimpering]

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.761
Zulbon: Hold it right there!

00:17:10.794 --> 00:17:12.330
Fun's over, you little twerp.

00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:14.467
Zulbon: Now call
that thing off.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.638
You let him go!

00:17:15.671 --> 00:17:17.440
You first, kiddo.

00:17:17.908 --> 00:17:19.845
[terrified squeak]

00:17:19.878 --> 00:17:20.848
All right, fine!

00:17:20.881 --> 00:17:22.116
Gulp!

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:25.591
[trembling]

00:17:25.624 --> 00:17:27.026
Zulbon: Gotcha.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:27.961
[delighted laughter]

00:17:27.995 --> 00:17:29.866
Clever as always, Zulbon!

00:17:29.899 --> 00:17:31.502
I'm sorry...

00:17:31.536 --> 00:17:33.873
Zulbon: Not so
tough now, are you?

00:17:33.907 --> 00:17:36.378
[cackling]

00:17:38.517 --> 00:17:40.219
[giggling]

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:44.060
[giggling]

00:17:44.094 --> 00:17:46.031
Oh, no. You've gotta
be kidding...

00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:48.102
[cackling]

00:17:48.135 --> 00:17:49.304
[terrified yell]

00:17:49.337 --> 00:17:51.308
A King Slime?!
Run for it-

00:17:51.809 --> 00:17:52.577
Zulbon!

00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:56.920
That King Slime
must've divided itself

00:17:56.953 --> 00:17:59.825
to get more comfortable
in its cylinder.

00:17:59.859 --> 00:18:01.796
Get away! No... Ah!

00:18:01.829 --> 00:18:02.798
Dai: That's it!

00:18:03.967 --> 00:18:05.637
Here goes - Gulp!

00:18:06.639 --> 00:18:09.444
[screaming]

00:18:12.951 --> 00:18:14.487
[relieved sigh]

00:18:15.857 --> 00:18:17.226
Brass: Great thinking, Dai!

00:18:17.259 --> 00:18:18.128
[happy squeak]

00:18:18.162 --> 00:18:19.966
[laughing]

00:18:19.999 --> 00:18:21.602
Glad you're safe, pal.

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:23.139
Blasted monsters!

00:18:23.172 --> 00:18:24.809
Soldier: The King
will have your heads.

00:18:24.842 --> 00:18:26.713
Not so fast...

00:18:26.746 --> 00:18:28.248
Deroline and
his companions

00:18:28.282 --> 00:18:30.486
led us to believe they
were righteous warriors,

00:18:30.521 --> 00:18:33.894
but their actions today have
proven quite the contrary...

00:18:33.927 --> 00:18:36.131
I fear I've made a mistake.

00:18:36.164 --> 00:18:38.503
You were tricked,
King Romos...

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:40.239
Watch your mouth!

00:18:40.272 --> 00:18:41.475
Let him speak.

00:18:41.509 --> 00:18:43.746
Perhaps we can even
learn something from him.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.349
I...

00:18:48.021 --> 00:18:51.696
King Romos: So, my taste for
treasure clouded my judgement...

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.032
And because of that,

00:18:53.065 --> 00:18:55.470
these petty thieves
played me like a fiddle.

00:18:55.504 --> 00:18:57.541
King Romos: This embarrassment
will have consequences.

00:18:57.575 --> 00:19:00.479
Dai here was only trying
to protect his friend,

00:19:00.513 --> 00:19:01.282
Your Majesty.

00:19:01.315 --> 00:19:02.918
We beg for your mercy.

00:19:02.952 --> 00:19:06.893
Not at all. It is I who
should be asking for yours.

00:19:06.926 --> 00:19:08.495
Bring that over here.

00:19:13.171 --> 00:19:14.440
[amazed breath]

00:19:14.474 --> 00:19:17.848
Perhaps it's the young
warrior from Dermline Island

00:19:17.881 --> 00:19:22.657
who is truly worthy of wearing
the Crown of Champions.

00:19:24.227 --> 00:19:27.601
Behold; the future Hero
of our noble kingdom!

00:19:27.635 --> 00:19:29.003
[cheering]

00:19:29.036 --> 00:19:31.207
[happy roaring]

00:19:31.241 --> 00:19:33.445
Is this really happening?

00:19:34.949 --> 00:19:36.786
[laughing]

00:19:40.126 --> 00:19:42.831
King Romos: Well,
that was quite a surprise.

00:19:42.865 --> 00:19:44.300
Let's hope there
aren't any more

00:19:44.334 --> 00:19:46.338
until we reach
Papnica Kingdom.

00:19:46.372 --> 00:19:47.674
Please, King Romos!

00:19:47.708 --> 00:19:49.511
You can't just
leave us out here...

00:19:49.545 --> 00:19:51.215
Zulbon: It was
Deroline's idea!

00:19:51.248 --> 00:19:52.383
Deroline: Thanks.

00:19:52.416 --> 00:19:54.889
Dai: Hey! Where'd my
Crown of Champions go?

00:19:54.922 --> 00:19:57.426
Huh? Don't ask me.

00:19:57.459 --> 00:19:59.231
I know you're
hiding it, Grampa.

00:19:59.264 --> 00:20:01.569
Just spit it out-
It's my treasure!

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.973
You mind your tone.

00:20:04.006 --> 00:20:05.510
And if it's really
such a treasure

00:20:05.544 --> 00:20:08.215
then maybe you should
keep a closer eye on it.

00:20:08.248 --> 00:20:10.554
Well, you shouldn't
steal from the future Hero!

00:20:10.587 --> 00:20:13.425
I've seen your future
and you're a Mage.

00:20:13.459 --> 00:20:17.033
End... Of... Story!

00:20:17.066 --> 00:20:19.939
It's not fair... Grampa!

00:20:19.972 --> 00:20:21.374
[happy squeaks]

00:20:26.151 --> 00:20:29.290
And Frizz!

00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:34.433
Pathetic!

00:20:35.269 --> 00:20:36.739
[pained groan]

00:20:36.772 --> 00:20:37.875
I can't do it!

00:20:37.908 --> 00:20:40.614
Now will you please just
start training me to be a Hero?

00:20:40.647 --> 00:20:44.187
Quit asking me that!
Put your heart into it.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:45.189
[frustrated groan]

00:20:45.223 --> 00:20:45.958
Huh?

00:20:45.991 --> 00:20:47.393
Dai: Another ship!

00:20:49.498 --> 00:20:51.101
Dai: That's a battleship!

00:20:51.134 --> 00:20:52.738
Bet they're coming
to invade us!

00:20:52.771 --> 00:20:53.873
Let's hope not!

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:57.681
Dai: Maybe the
King sent someone.

00:20:58.482 --> 00:21:00.286
No, that's the Sacred Ship.

00:21:00.319 --> 00:21:02.290
It's a special
craft that only the Sages

00:21:02.323 --> 00:21:03.993
are allowed to travel aboard.

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:13.212
Dai: So...

00:21:13.245 --> 00:21:15.149
Which one's the Sage?

00:21:15.182 --> 00:21:16.919
Be quiet and bow!

00:21:21.294 --> 00:21:23.499
You must be Dai,
the future Hero...

00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:25.637
And Brass,
the venerable Mage.

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:27.874
That's right! You found us.

00:21:27.908 --> 00:21:29.277
What brings us the honor?

00:21:29.311 --> 00:21:30.613
Temjin: My name is Temjin.

00:21:30.647 --> 00:21:32.985
I'm the Bishop
of Papnica Island...

00:21:33.018 --> 00:21:34.554
This is our Sage, Varon.

00:21:34.588 --> 00:21:37.828
We're escorting Princess Leona
on a very important quest,

00:21:37.861 --> 00:21:39.164
and we need your help.

00:21:39.197 --> 00:21:40.633
A Princess?

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:49.885
[giggling]

00:21:50.954 --> 00:21:53.325
Are you Dai,
the future Hero?

00:21:53.727 --> 00:21:54.862
Yep!

00:21:54.896 --> 00:21:55.931
[giggling]

00:21:55.964 --> 00:21:57.467
Oh, boy. You're tiny!

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.072
King Romos sure does
know how to pick 'em.

00:22:00.105 --> 00:22:03.078
[devastated grunt]

00:23:37.968 --> 00:23:39.470
Narrator: The adventure
continues with

00:23:39.505 --> 00:23:41.208
Princess Leona's arrival,

00:23:41.241 --> 00:23:43.045
and Dai struggles
to prove his worth

00:23:43.078 --> 00:23:45.717
as he guides her across
Dermline Island...

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:47.688
Until a rogue creature attacks,

00:23:47.721 --> 00:23:52.029
and the princess is struck by
its venomous stinger...

00:23:52.062 --> 00:23:54.433
The future Hero unleashes
an incredible energy,

00:23:54.467 --> 00:23:56.505
but can he save Leona
before it's too late?

00:23:56.538 --> 00:23:58.242

00:23:58.275 --> 00:24:01.080
