WEBVTT

00:01:50.622 --> 00:01:52.024
[roaring]

00:01:52.057 --> 00:01:54.829
[pained groans]

00:01:59.907 --> 00:02:01.610
Baran: When this
Dragon Crest shines,

00:02:01.643 --> 00:02:05.819
my body is enveloped in
a current of life energy.

00:02:05.852 --> 00:02:09.091
It is called
the Draconic Aura.

00:02:09.124 --> 00:02:11.998
It's an unmatched
defensive ability-

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:15.203
that will repel any
kind of incantation.

00:02:17.775 --> 00:02:21.049
Crocodine [thought]:
I see. That explains it.

00:02:21.082 --> 00:02:23.319
When Dai's crest was shining,

00:02:23.353 --> 00:02:27.494
his level of resistance
rose beyond my attack.

00:02:27.528 --> 00:02:30.935
Baran: Now that I've fully
deployed my protective aura,

00:02:30.968 --> 00:02:32.939
you'll find that in battle...

00:02:38.183 --> 00:02:40.086
There is no creature
in the entire world

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.324
that can stand against me!

00:02:47.702 --> 00:02:48.504
[gasps]

00:03:03.801 --> 00:03:07.141
[pained roar]

00:03:07.174 --> 00:03:08.577
Stop it!

00:03:09.211 --> 00:03:10.346
[shocked breaths]

00:03:15.324 --> 00:03:18.496
Now, my friend...
you can fight no longer.

00:03:20.835 --> 00:03:21.903
P-Princess?

00:03:22.905 --> 00:03:24.542
Go and help Dai.

00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:27.314
Okay. I'm on it!

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.604
Leona [thought]:
So much damage...

00:03:38.637 --> 00:03:40.975
So this is what
a Gigabreak does.

00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:43.514
Dai, hang in there.

00:03:43.547 --> 00:03:46.318
You're a Hero, aren't you?!

00:03:47.221 --> 00:03:48.757
Baran: Surrender.

00:03:50.728 --> 00:03:51.763
Popp: Hold it!

00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:55.004
Popp, you can't...

00:03:55.037 --> 00:03:56.674
What are you doing, boy?

00:03:56.707 --> 00:04:01.115
If my Magic isn't going to work-
I'll have to use this thing!

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:02.885
You can't be that stupid.

00:04:04.923 --> 00:04:07.696
Popp [thought]: I'm like
a frog staring down a snake.

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:09.633
I can barely move.

00:04:09.667 --> 00:04:11.636
Baran: The reason
I defeated Crocodine

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.777
so thoroughly just now,
is because he's the type of

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.682
monster that's the
greatest threat to me.

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:21.757
Indeed, the Draconic Aura
will deflect any type of spell-

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:22.759
but a truly great force

00:04:22.792 --> 00:04:25.430
may still be able
to pierce my defenses,

00:04:25.463 --> 00:04:28.570
and deal fatal
damage to me directly.

00:04:28.604 --> 00:04:30.341
Not very smart
of you, old man-

00:04:30.374 --> 00:04:32.979
giving away your
weakness, just like that?

00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:35.450
Baran: Young fool.

00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:37.187
Crocodine is mighty.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.391
A strike from a
weakling Mage like you

00:04:39.425 --> 00:04:42.765
will be of no
consequence at all.

00:04:42.798 --> 00:04:47.341
In fact, it might hurt
you more than it would me.

00:04:47.374 --> 00:04:49.879
Popp [thought]:
I still have to try...

00:04:49.913 --> 00:04:51.215
Don't do this, Popp!

00:04:51.248 --> 00:04:52.518
Wait a minute.

00:04:53.085 --> 00:04:54.087
Merle: But I-

00:04:54.121 --> 00:04:56.225
I have to do
something. Popp is...

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:58.664
Popp is going to
get himself killed!

00:04:58.697 --> 00:04:59.966
Merle, dear...

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:01.101
What about you?

00:05:03.907 --> 00:05:05.744
Okay. Here goes!

00:05:09.318 --> 00:05:10.922
Hey - Crocodine...

00:05:10.955 --> 00:05:14.529
I told you, Popp. You just
leave this one to me.

00:05:14.562 --> 00:05:16.567
You're in no
condition to fight.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.811
I still have my left arm.
Don't lose hope, yet.

00:05:21.844 --> 00:05:22.979
B-But...

00:05:23.012 --> 00:05:26.352
Even though it might look
like I've been blinded,

00:05:26.385 --> 00:05:29.324
I can still see
with my inner eye.

00:05:29.358 --> 00:05:31.062
The inner eye that you...

00:05:31.096 --> 00:05:32.799
You cleared for me.

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:34.135
I did?

00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:35.270
Crocodine: That's right.

00:05:35.303 --> 00:05:37.975
Back when we
fought in Romos...

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:40.781
You risked your
life to face me,

00:05:40.815 --> 00:05:43.688
someone you
couldn't hope to beat.

00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:47.228
You showed me the
greatness of humanity,

00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:50.801
trusting and fighting
together, as one.

00:05:50.835 --> 00:05:54.843
The one who cleared the filth
that was staining my heart...

00:05:54.876 --> 00:05:56.045
Was you.

00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:57.281
Know that.

00:05:57.314 --> 00:05:58.684
Crocodine...

00:05:58.717 --> 00:06:01.557
That's why I will
risk my life, as well.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.661
Baran may be unbeatable,

00:06:03.694 --> 00:06:05.698
but I couldn't call
myself your friend-

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:08.469
if I did nothing
to really stop him!

00:06:09.873 --> 00:06:11.843
Popp [thought]:
Thank you, Big Guy...

00:06:11.876 --> 00:06:14.415
But you don't have
to fight alone.

00:06:14.448 --> 00:06:16.519
We will fight together.

00:06:19.793 --> 00:06:24.001
Here we go, Baran.
This is my final attack!

00:06:24.035 --> 00:06:25.270
You brute.

00:06:25.304 --> 00:06:27.508
I've already dodged
your best attack.

00:06:27.542 --> 00:06:30.179
But let's see what
you can do, anyway.

00:06:30.213 --> 00:06:33.587
And I doubt that
you will dodge this.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.893
Gigabreak?!

00:06:36.926 --> 00:06:40.067
Baran: I held back earlier
when I used this on my son,

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.803
but I won't this time.

00:06:41.837 --> 00:06:44.909
Though some might show
mercy on a former ally,

00:06:44.943 --> 00:06:47.447
I cannot let anyone
praise humanity-

00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:50.019
and allow them to survive!

00:06:51.624 --> 00:06:53.861
His wrath has
overwhelmed him.

00:06:53.894 --> 00:06:56.365
You mean he was
holding back before?!

00:06:56.398 --> 00:06:58.971
I'll reduce you both to ashes!

00:07:10.226 --> 00:07:11.796
It... It can't be.

00:07:15.036 --> 00:07:18.176
No way! Looks like
Dai's back in the fight!

00:07:18.209 --> 00:07:19.612
What? But how?

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.824
I cast a Fullheal.
He's at full stamina!

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:30.835
And what difference do you
really think it'll make?

00:07:30.868 --> 00:07:32.337
You've just made it easier...

00:07:32.371 --> 00:07:34.375
Easier to get all of you!

00:07:34.408 --> 00:07:36.245
Now, Kazap!

00:07:41.623 --> 00:07:44.161
Wh-What?! Impossible!

00:07:44.195 --> 00:07:48.003
Crocodine, I need you to follow
my aim and then use that attack!

00:07:48.036 --> 00:07:49.004
Got it!

00:07:51.142 --> 00:07:52.444
Avan...

00:07:52.477 --> 00:07:54.181
Strash!

00:07:56.152 --> 00:07:57.487
Crocodine: I see it!

00:07:59.157 --> 00:08:00.427
Beast King...

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:04.134
Redemption Blast!

00:08:26.078 --> 00:08:27.615
Popp: You did it!

00:08:29.151 --> 00:08:29.986
Crocodine!

00:08:30.019 --> 00:08:32.190
Crocodine: It's
all right, Dai...

00:08:32.224 --> 00:08:34.829
Your eye. What
did he do to it?

00:08:34.862 --> 00:08:37.935
It's nothing. Don't worry
about this old beast.

00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:41.375
Leona, we need you to
look at Crocodine's eye!

00:08:41.408 --> 00:08:42.545
Leona: Got it!

00:08:44.381 --> 00:08:45.651
Merle!

00:08:45.685 --> 00:08:48.122
Merle: It's all right.
He has a cut on his eyelid.

00:08:48.155 --> 00:08:51.161
Wait a second - what are you
still doing here, you two?

00:08:51.195 --> 00:08:52.965
Well, I wanted us to run.

00:08:52.998 --> 00:08:57.240
But this one here insisted
on staying and helping you.

00:08:58.577 --> 00:08:59.980
They needed us

00:09:00.013 --> 00:09:02.885
and I know how to perform all
the basic heal spells, too.

00:09:02.918 --> 00:09:03.754
You should go.

00:09:03.787 --> 00:09:06.158
Leave the healing
to Leona and run!

00:09:06.192 --> 00:09:06.994
But, I...

00:09:07.027 --> 00:09:10.099
The boy is right,
young lady.

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:10.835
Huh?

00:09:10.868 --> 00:09:12.938
Maybe if it was anyone else-

00:09:12.972 --> 00:09:17.314
but Baran is the deadliest
soldier in the entire Dark Army.

00:09:17.347 --> 00:09:18.517
But, still...

00:09:18.551 --> 00:09:21.656
After being hit by an
attack like that one...

00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:26.733
I knew it!

00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:28.870
He fully deployed
his Draconic Aura

00:09:28.904 --> 00:09:31.142
to resist your
combined attack!

00:09:31.175 --> 00:09:32.645
We are so doomed.

00:09:32.679 --> 00:09:35.350
Avan Strash and Beast
King Redemption Blast

00:09:35.383 --> 00:09:37.187
and he's completely undamaged.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.526
What are we supposed to do?!

00:09:39.559 --> 00:09:41.295
No, I think it worked!

00:09:43.934 --> 00:09:44.535
Look!

00:09:44.569 --> 00:09:45.738
He's hurt!

00:09:45.772 --> 00:09:48.944
He's got the same red
blood... that we all do.

00:09:48.977 --> 00:09:50.112
W-What?!

00:09:54.287 --> 00:09:55.658
Baran [thought]:
Impossible.

00:09:55.691 --> 00:09:57.762
They broke through
my Draconic Aura

00:09:57.795 --> 00:10:00.901
and landed a
legitimate attack!

00:10:00.935 --> 00:10:05.611
Even with help from his friends,
for such a small child...

00:10:05.645 --> 00:10:08.917
But it wasn't just
his strength alone.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:12.457
The power of his friends
had great influence.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.094
Dai's comrades...

00:10:14.127 --> 00:10:17.935
they risked their lives
and did everything they could.

00:10:17.968 --> 00:10:20.473
In turn, his compassion
for them filled his heart,

00:10:20.508 --> 00:10:22.746
and multiplied his power.

00:10:22.779 --> 00:10:25.083
Unless that bond is broken,

00:10:25.116 --> 00:10:27.955
Dai's might will
continue to grow.

00:10:27.989 --> 00:10:32.363
He may even eventually
become a threat to me.

00:10:32.999 --> 00:10:34.034
He's coming!

00:10:35.303 --> 00:10:39.344
Crocodine, it looks like our
attacks had an effect after all.

00:10:40.313 --> 00:10:41.449
In that case...

00:10:41.482 --> 00:10:42.651
Indeed.

00:10:42.685 --> 00:10:45.624
Either he's going to fall
or all of us will.

00:10:45.657 --> 00:10:48.730
Let's keep fighting
and find out, shall we?

00:10:48.763 --> 00:10:51.903
What a shame that the same
ploy won't work twice.

00:10:51.936 --> 00:10:54.509
You're not going to be
able to evade my Gigabreak

00:10:54.542 --> 00:10:56.779
with your pathetic
tricks again.

00:10:57.748 --> 00:11:00.888
However, one can
never be certain.

00:11:00.921 --> 00:11:05.062
The boy is capable of a
terrifying amount of potential.

00:11:05.096 --> 00:11:08.870
And so now, I will use
all my remaining energy-

00:11:08.904 --> 00:11:11.441
to destroy your
source of power.

00:11:25.771 --> 00:11:27.408
His Aura's gone.

00:11:27.441 --> 00:11:29.344
Now what is he up to?

00:11:30.113 --> 00:11:32.350
[growling]

00:11:33.654 --> 00:11:36.224
[roaring]

00:11:37.929 --> 00:11:39.365
What... What's going on?!

00:11:39.398 --> 00:11:41.034
It's acting on its own!

00:11:41.636 --> 00:11:47.347
[pained groans]

00:11:47.381 --> 00:11:49.418
What is that awful noise?!

00:11:49.451 --> 00:11:53.192
The two Dragon Crests are
resonating with each other!

00:11:53.225 --> 00:11:57.367
[pained groans]

00:12:12.197 --> 00:12:15.804
My head... My head feels
like it's splitting!

00:12:18.878 --> 00:12:20.715
Dai: Grampa Brass...

00:12:20.748 --> 00:12:22.885
What are you doing here?

00:12:28.296 --> 00:12:29.599
Gomechan...

00:12:29.633 --> 00:12:32.771
and everyone home
on Dermline island?

00:12:36.646 --> 00:12:39.719
[pained yell]

00:12:39.753 --> 00:12:42.123
Why am I seeing
all of this?!

00:12:42.157 --> 00:12:44.796
[roaring]

00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:47.066
[pained yell]

00:12:53.079 --> 00:12:54.214
Dai!

00:12:54.715 --> 00:12:56.084
Leona: Hey...

00:13:00.928 --> 00:13:03.667
Baran - What did you do?!

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.706
Baran: Taken what my
son no longer needs.

00:13:06.739 --> 00:13:07.808
You did what?!

00:13:07.842 --> 00:13:11.014
I've used... too
much of my strength.

00:13:11.048 --> 00:13:13.720
For now, I will
have to retreat.

00:13:13.754 --> 00:13:17.460
But I shall return to
reclaim Dino, my son.

00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:23.439
Popp: Huh?
It's over? We won?

00:13:25.209 --> 00:13:26.445
Leona: Dai!

00:13:26.479 --> 00:13:27.614
Popp: Are you okay?

00:13:27.648 --> 00:13:29.585
What a relief-
we were worried!

00:13:31.088 --> 00:13:34.327
What's wrong? You look
confused or something.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.371
W-Who are... you guys?

00:13:39.404 --> 00:13:40.974
[shocked gasps]

00:13:43.112 --> 00:13:47.420
What am I even doing
out here? It's cold.

00:13:58.042 --> 00:14:01.348
Zaboera: Why did Baran leave
without finishing the fight?

00:14:01.382 --> 00:14:05.490
That's odd.
He couldn't have given up.

00:14:05.524 --> 00:14:06.893
Killvearn: [chuckling]

00:14:06.926 --> 00:14:09.064
Interesting.

00:14:21.556 --> 00:14:23.192
I got us all some food.

00:14:23.226 --> 00:14:26.365
There's medicinal herbs and
other things we might need.

00:14:26.398 --> 00:14:28.703
Thanks, Merle.
It's a real help.

00:14:28.737 --> 00:14:32.411
But wasn't it hard with the
whole countryside in chaos?

00:14:32.444 --> 00:14:34.615
No, it was the opposite.

00:14:34.649 --> 00:14:35.951
Huh?

00:14:35.984 --> 00:14:40.561
Everyone was shut inside,
or praying to the heavens.

00:14:40.594 --> 00:14:42.898
I've never heard it so quiet.

00:14:42.932 --> 00:14:44.668
Seriously?

00:14:44.702 --> 00:14:46.907
After everything
that just happened?

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:51.081
That's the sort of place...
Teran Kingdom is.

00:14:52.117 --> 00:14:53.754
It's all people
who know nothing

00:14:53.787 --> 00:14:56.424
but to worship
and pray to the gods.

00:14:57.594 --> 00:14:59.364
I guess you can't blame them.

00:14:59.397 --> 00:15:01.670
I mean, we should be
doing a little praying

00:15:01.703 --> 00:15:03.238
of our own right now.

00:15:04.074 --> 00:15:05.978
How's it looking, Princess?

00:15:06.011 --> 00:15:09.451
Well, Crocodine's
eye should heal.

00:15:09.484 --> 00:15:10.386
But...

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.204
Gomechan: [sad chirps]

00:15:20.941 --> 00:15:22.410
Dai: You're cute,
little guy.

00:15:22.443 --> 00:15:23.279
What's your name?

00:15:23.312 --> 00:15:24.113
[hopeful chirp]

00:15:24.147 --> 00:15:26.719
Come here. Why
don't we be friends?

00:15:26.752 --> 00:15:29.726
[saddened chirp]

00:15:29.759 --> 00:15:30.827
Hey, what's wrong?

00:15:30.861 --> 00:15:31.997
Why are you crying?

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.833
[tearful chirping]

00:15:33.867 --> 00:15:35.537
It's total amnesia.

00:15:36.773 --> 00:15:37.875
Are you sure about that?

00:15:37.908 --> 00:15:39.177
When Baran...

00:15:39.211 --> 00:15:42.383
Said that he took something
that Dai doesn't need,

00:15:42.417 --> 00:15:43.686
I think he meant...

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.791
Dai's memories
that make him human.

00:15:45.824 --> 00:15:47.127
So...

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.299
You're saying that was a
spell that takes memories away?

00:15:50.332 --> 00:15:52.303
No, it wasn't.

00:15:52.337 --> 00:15:54.374
It was probably
an attack using

00:15:54.407 --> 00:15:57.748
the resonance of
the Dragon Crests.

00:15:57.782 --> 00:16:02.958
He focused all of his energy and
funneled it into Dai's brain.

00:16:02.991 --> 00:16:06.666
Dai was too young to
handle Baran's energy

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.404
and was overwhelmed by it.

00:16:09.437 --> 00:16:12.476
As a result, his
memory was erased,

00:16:12.511 --> 00:16:15.885
leaving his mind
like a blank slate.

00:16:15.918 --> 00:16:17.054
[chuckling]

00:16:17.087 --> 00:16:18.857
Merle: Can he be cured?

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:20.393
Don't know.

00:16:20.426 --> 00:16:23.165
But right now,
Dai is like an infant.

00:16:23.198 --> 00:16:26.806
If Baran were...
to attack us again...

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.843
Leona: Forget that!

00:16:28.877 --> 00:16:30.413
What's more
important than that...

00:16:30.447 --> 00:16:35.757
Is now every memory of us that
Dai kept in his head... is gone!

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:37.426
Dai, tell me.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.266
Do you not
remember anything?

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:43.005
Have you really
forgotten my face?

00:16:44.141 --> 00:16:47.948
Why does... Why does
everyone keep calling me Dai?

00:16:47.981 --> 00:16:50.721
Is that, like...
my name or something?

00:16:50.754 --> 00:16:52.691
Leona: That's right!
You're Dai.

00:16:52.725 --> 00:16:55.429
You lived on Dermline
Island with monsters,

00:16:55.463 --> 00:16:57.601
and you dreamed
of being a Hero!

00:16:57.635 --> 00:16:58.903
And that's where...

00:16:58.937 --> 00:17:00.272
And that's where...

00:17:00.306 --> 00:17:03.145
That's where you
and I first met.

00:17:04.147 --> 00:17:05.984
Dermline Island...

00:17:06.018 --> 00:17:07.020
A Hero...

00:17:07.053 --> 00:17:08.791
[pained grunts]

00:17:08.824 --> 00:17:09.892
Oh no...

00:17:09.925 --> 00:17:10.994
[pained grunts]

00:17:11.028 --> 00:17:14.668
My head...
I-It hurts so bad!

00:17:20.981 --> 00:17:24.588
Here, pal. Let's try
this on for size.

00:17:24.622 --> 00:17:27.193
Oh, thank you... M-mister.

00:17:32.738 --> 00:17:33.974
Why, you...

00:17:34.007 --> 00:17:36.947
Have you even forgotten
my name, too? Huh?!

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:38.215
What about Master Avan,

00:17:38.248 --> 00:17:41.556
after he sacrificed
himself to save our lives?!

00:17:41.589 --> 00:17:42.457
Well?!

00:17:42.491 --> 00:17:44.929
What are you doing?!
You're hurting me!

00:17:44.963 --> 00:17:46.164
Popp, stop it! Right now!

00:17:46.198 --> 00:17:47.735
That's enough, Popp!

00:17:47.768 --> 00:17:48.536
Come on!

00:17:51.341 --> 00:17:55.015
Take it. Take this sword...
and you remember it.

00:17:55.049 --> 00:17:58.088
Remember your
greatest attack!

00:17:58.121 --> 00:18:01.797
No, I... I can't do
that. I have no idea!

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.398
Popp: I know you can!

00:18:04.334 --> 00:18:06.204
You mastered the Avan Strash-

00:18:06.237 --> 00:18:08.042
something even
a genius swordsman

00:18:08.075 --> 00:18:10.379
like Hyunckel
wasn't able to do.

00:18:10.412 --> 00:18:13.452
Your brain may not remember,
but your body must!

00:18:13.485 --> 00:18:16.025
No, let go of me
-swords are scary!

00:18:16.058 --> 00:18:17.995
Popp: Do it! Do it now!

00:18:18.028 --> 00:18:21.234
Whether it's Earth
Slash or Wave Slash...

00:18:21.936 --> 00:18:23.506
Just do it!

00:18:29.151 --> 00:18:32.290
[sobbing]

00:18:32.323 --> 00:18:35.396
Dai: That man is scary.
He's bullying me!

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:43.846
[sobbing]

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.152
Popp [thought]:
It's hopeless.

00:18:46.185 --> 00:18:49.258
With Dai like this...

00:18:49.291 --> 00:18:51.996
When Baran attacks again...

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:54.034
We'll be powerless!

00:18:54.067 --> 00:18:56.640
Dai: [sobbing]

00:18:56.673 --> 00:18:57.975
Oh, Popp...

00:18:58.008 --> 00:19:07.426
Dai: [sniffling]

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.631
All right, Dai. Let's go.

00:19:10.166 --> 00:19:11.267
Dai: Huh?

00:19:14.107 --> 00:19:15.677
Hadlar: Where
the hell is Baran?!

00:19:15.711 --> 00:19:20.385
First he fails to capture Dai,
and now he hasn't reported back.

00:19:20.419 --> 00:19:24.194
I knew that we should never
have left this task to him!

00:19:24.227 --> 00:19:28.536
Killvearn: No, that
was a brilliant move.

00:19:28.569 --> 00:19:30.974
Cutting the bond between
Dai and his friends

00:19:31.008 --> 00:19:33.780
has rendered him useless.

00:19:33.813 --> 00:19:36.484
And now it's...

00:19:36.519 --> 00:19:38.556
Checkmate.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:41.394
The next battle
will be one to see.

00:19:41.428 --> 00:19:45.837
I'm sure Baran is gathering
all the forces he can.

00:19:47.206 --> 00:19:48.677
Do you mean...

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:50.981
Heyedra: Alert! Alert!

00:19:51.014 --> 00:19:53.018
Heyedra: We've located Baran.

00:19:53.051 --> 00:19:54.354
Where is he?

00:19:54.388 --> 00:19:57.628
Heyedra: The southern
tip of Bengarna Kingdom.

00:19:57.661 --> 00:20:01.101
He's been recuperating
at Argo Point.

00:20:01.134 --> 00:20:02.705
Hadlar: What's he playing at?

00:20:02.738 --> 00:20:04.474
Heyedra: Showing now...

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:10.687
Zaboera: What are those
three colored bonfires?

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.459
Hadlar: He's summoning
the Dragon Masters.

00:20:13.492 --> 00:20:15.731
Oh? And what are they?

00:20:15.764 --> 00:20:19.471
Baran is already unmatched
with his army of dragons,

00:20:19.505 --> 00:20:22.410
so it's not widely known,
but he also has

00:20:22.443 --> 00:20:26.952
three powerful servants
called the Dragon Masters.

00:20:28.623 --> 00:20:32.898
I summon you, masters
of the Three Disciplines.

00:20:32.931 --> 00:20:37.306
It is time for the Dragon
Legion... to go to battle!

00:20:40.981 --> 00:20:43.854
Hadlar: The Dragon Masters
are powerful Dragon Riders

00:20:43.887 --> 00:20:47.427
who control beasts
of land, sea, and sky.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.299
When they gather
together under Baran,

00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:52.237
their destructive force...

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:55.309
defies the imagination.

00:20:55.342 --> 00:20:57.615
And they are his servants?!

00:20:57.648 --> 00:21:01.054
Killvearn: He's pulling
out all the stops.

00:21:01.088 --> 00:21:05.062
So much for your
chances, Hadlar.

00:21:10.607 --> 00:21:13.546
There you are. Very good.

00:21:17.721 --> 00:21:19.625
[roaring]

00:21:19.658 --> 00:21:22.363
Galdandy: Member
of the Dragon Masters,

00:21:22.396 --> 00:21:25.603
Sky Rider Galdandy is here!

00:21:32.383 --> 00:21:34.689
[roaring]

00:21:34.722 --> 00:21:39.798
So has Sea Rider
Borahorn, King of the Sea!

00:21:49.518 --> 00:21:53.358
Land Rider Larhart,
at your service.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.540
Awaiting... your command.

00:23:37.668 --> 00:23:40.640
Narrator: The three Dragon
Masters assemble under Baran,

00:23:40.674 --> 00:23:44.581
and together they head to
Teran Kingdom to reclaim Dai.

00:23:44.614 --> 00:23:47.486
Meanwhile, our Hero
remains without his memory,

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:50.928
and the rest of his
party begins to crumble.

00:23:50.961 --> 00:23:53.533
But as Baran's
merciless forces close in,

00:23:53.566 --> 00:23:55.937
Popp decides
to take a stand.

00:23:55.971 --> 00:23:57.641
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:57.674 --> 00:24:00.313
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:00.346 --> 00:24:02.751
"The Dragon
Masters Approach".
