WEBVTT

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:51.690
Now...

00:01:51.724 --> 00:01:55.197
Take this!

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.301
[pained scream]

00:01:57.334 --> 00:01:58.871
Mystvearn: King Vearn!

00:02:02.613 --> 00:02:03.413
Yeah, that's right!

00:02:03.446 --> 00:02:05.785
Dai actually pulled it off.

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:13.600
Alright. Now, Maam!

00:02:14.503 --> 00:02:16.773
We should heal up
before they can...

00:02:18.143 --> 00:02:19.980
Maam: Is that a Fullheal?!

00:02:20.013 --> 00:02:21.817
Oh, no. H-Hurry!

00:02:24.523 --> 00:02:25.390
[gasp]

00:02:32.104 --> 00:02:33.406
Hyunckel [thought]:
Legend has it that

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:36.312
a phoenix can be
reborn from its ashes...

00:02:36.346 --> 00:02:38.416
But something like him...

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.227
That was even more
than I expected.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.132
The great Draconic Aura.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:51.409
A terrifying ability in
both attack and defense.

00:02:52.478 --> 00:02:55.283
I cannot win bare-handed.

00:02:56.954 --> 00:02:59.592
Vearn: You leave
me no choice.

00:03:00.728 --> 00:03:04.569
It seems I must use
my own legendary weapon.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.111
Lon Beruk: The
heavens are trembling.

00:03:09.145 --> 00:03:10.815
The Dark King Vearn
has appeared,

00:03:10.848 --> 00:03:14.121
and will wield his most
terrifying weapon at last.

00:03:14.154 --> 00:03:16.660
His what? How can
you even tell?

00:03:16.693 --> 00:03:19.265
I know, because...

00:03:19.298 --> 00:03:21.235
I created it.

00:03:29.218 --> 00:03:30.554
Oh, no...

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.732
Vearn: This is my weapon...

00:03:35.765 --> 00:03:39.171
the Staff of Edacity.

00:03:39.205 --> 00:03:40.875
Dai [thought]:
What is that thing?

00:03:40.908 --> 00:03:43.680
Your fate cannot be escaped.

00:03:43.714 --> 00:03:47.556
Now that we both wield
weapons forged by Lon Beruk,

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:51.563
our strength alone will decide
who shall be the victor.

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:54.034
Lon Beruk made yours, too?

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.705
He would never!

00:03:55.738 --> 00:03:59.112
The man is a
Darkling, is he not?

00:03:59.145 --> 00:04:01.583
Considering his very nature,

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:03.521
what's far more
surprising is that

00:04:03.554 --> 00:04:07.194
he gave you humans
your weapons, isn't it?

00:04:07.228 --> 00:04:08.329
Back then.

00:04:08.363 --> 00:04:10.768
I showed him several
weapons of mine,

00:04:10.801 --> 00:04:13.541
all of them like
the Dark Armor Sword.

00:04:13.574 --> 00:04:18.383
Vearn chose the Staff of
Edacity to carry into battle.

00:04:18.416 --> 00:04:19.986
And, just what is it?

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.159
Lon Beruk: You've heard
of a Somatic Staff, right?

00:04:23.193 --> 00:04:24.495
Of course.

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:27.368
It converts Magic Power
into attack power, doesn't it?

00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:30.274
This functions with
the same principle.

00:04:30.307 --> 00:04:32.344
But, while a Somatic
Staff is limited in

00:04:32.378 --> 00:04:34.716
how much Magic Power
it can convert,

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:39.358
the Staff of Edacity
suffers no such limitations.

00:04:39.391 --> 00:04:41.228
When the Dark King wields it

00:04:41.262 --> 00:04:44.368
with the entire depth of
his magical ability...

00:04:44.401 --> 00:04:46.640
It becomes the greatest tool,

00:04:46.674 --> 00:04:50.881
the most terribly
destructive weapon of all.

00:04:51.884 --> 00:04:54.054
And now, observe...

00:04:54.088 --> 00:04:57.394
The true masterpiece
of Lon Beruk.

00:05:04.676 --> 00:05:05.344
Drink up.

00:05:05.377 --> 00:05:08.015
My power belongs to you!

00:05:29.425 --> 00:05:30.562
Now, come.

00:05:30.595 --> 00:05:33.065
Let us try this again.

00:05:55.244 --> 00:05:57.915
[roaring]

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:03.994
[roaring]

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.442
[gasp]

00:06:36.092 --> 00:06:37.494
It broke?!

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:38.864
The Sword of Dai - it's...

00:06:38.897 --> 00:06:41.402
Supposed to be to
be indestructible!

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.718
It seems you've lost
your will to fight, boy.

00:06:48.751 --> 00:06:53.827
Hardly anyone has managed
to last this long before.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.401
You can be proud...

00:06:57.434 --> 00:06:59.973
in the afterlife.

00:07:00.007 --> 00:07:01.176
Dai!

00:07:01.209 --> 00:07:02.378
What's wrong with you?!

00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:03.379
Get up!

00:07:03.412 --> 00:07:04.749
Move it, now!

00:07:04.783 --> 00:07:07.121
Popp: You have to get up!

00:07:07.154 --> 00:07:09.025
I'm begging you, pal.

00:07:09.058 --> 00:07:13.501
Don't make us all see you
like this before the end!

00:07:13.534 --> 00:07:17.708
This is the last thing
you will ever see.

00:07:18.142 --> 00:07:21.549
Calamitous Wall!

00:07:22.251 --> 00:07:25.056
Now, embrace your defeat!

00:07:34.475 --> 00:07:37.047
Dai: Hyunckel! Crocodine!

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.953
So, Crocodine. Are you
with me on this one?

00:07:39.986 --> 00:07:41.155
Indeed.

00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:45.330
I owe everything that I have
to the hero and his friends!

00:07:45.363 --> 00:07:46.165
Y-You guys...

00:07:46.198 --> 00:07:47.168
You aren't...

00:07:47.201 --> 00:07:49.506
Both of you - move it!

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:52.177
We're right where
we need to be.

00:07:52.211 --> 00:07:53.714
If this is the end,

00:07:53.747 --> 00:07:55.951
I can think of
nowhere better...

00:07:55.985 --> 00:08:00.026
Than to be here, giving
you the time you need!

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.968
At least let us choose
where we will meet our end!

00:08:04.001 --> 00:08:05.571
But, you can't...

00:08:07.274 --> 00:08:13.119
[roaring]

00:08:13.152 --> 00:08:18.864
[pained howling]

00:08:18.897 --> 00:08:19.932
Hyunckel, no!

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:21.135
Crocodine!

00:08:26.345 --> 00:08:27.715
Dai...

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.525
It's futile. I win.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.430
Vearn: Once
it's been unleashed,

00:08:35.464 --> 00:08:39.539
the Calamitous Wall
cannot be stopped.

00:08:41.208 --> 00:08:43.179
Popp: Maam...

00:08:43.212 --> 00:08:45.150
I've gotta ask.

00:08:45.183 --> 00:08:47.187
Would you...

00:08:47.221 --> 00:08:49.324
Would you please
hold my hand...

00:08:49.358 --> 00:08:52.197
until this... is all over?

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:19.685
[screaming]

00:09:22.859 --> 00:09:24.663
Popp: I-It can't be...

00:09:24.696 --> 00:09:26.031
It's Hadlar!

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:28.670
What is he doing?!

00:09:41.697 --> 00:09:43.700
Vearn: This is a surprise.

00:09:43.733 --> 00:09:47.174
Not only that you've managed
to survive the Black Core,

00:09:47.207 --> 00:09:50.447
but that you've also
sided with the boy...

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.383
Hadlar.

00:09:53.252 --> 00:09:55.891
I haven't sided with anyone.

00:09:55.924 --> 00:09:57.829
I just didn't
want you stealing

00:09:57.862 --> 00:10:01.804
my one real chance at
revenge against the Hero.

00:10:01.837 --> 00:10:04.942
Hadlar: If Dai had
perished, it would have

00:10:04.976 --> 00:10:09.619
made my transformation into
a monster meaningless...

00:10:09.652 --> 00:10:12.925
And I would have
no reason to live.

00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:17.133
Vearn: Then fear not.
For your death is imminent.

00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:20.373
Vearn: You see, the Black Core

00:10:20.406 --> 00:10:23.681
was already fused
with your body.

00:10:23.714 --> 00:10:25.250
Now that it's been removed,

00:10:25.283 --> 00:10:29.291
you only have so much
time left to live.

00:10:29.324 --> 00:10:33.332
Vearn: But the reason I
know you won't survive...

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:36.906
is because I am going to
finish you off here and now,

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.276
Dark Lord.

00:10:38.309 --> 00:10:41.215
I have been generous,
giving you chance after chance

00:10:41.248 --> 00:10:44.689
to prove yourself
over all these years,

00:10:44.722 --> 00:10:46.826
but I'm not so
forgiving that I will

00:10:46.859 --> 00:10:51.101
allow my prey to
be stolen from me.

00:10:51.135 --> 00:10:57.146
Therefore, you need not worry
about having a reason to live.

00:11:05.565 --> 00:11:06.834
We're finally free.

00:11:06.867 --> 00:11:09.271
Sigma: I sense Lord
Hadlar's presence...

00:11:09.304 --> 00:11:10.173
He's close.

00:11:10.206 --> 00:11:11.174
Well, good.

00:11:15.551 --> 00:11:16.686
Hym: What?!

00:11:16.719 --> 00:11:20.359
King Vearn and Lord
Hadlar are fighting?!

00:11:20.393 --> 00:11:22.565
We must assist our master.

00:11:22.598 --> 00:11:24.468
Mystvearn: You will not!

00:11:24.502 --> 00:11:27.307
Dark Puppetry
Aura Decimation Field!

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.810
[pained groans]

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:34.154
Killvearn: You're out
of moves here, Queen.

00:11:34.187 --> 00:11:36.291
Hadlar [thought]:
Those four...

00:11:36.325 --> 00:11:39.231
Just what is going
on here, Mystvearn?!

00:11:39.265 --> 00:11:42.370
Mystvearn: Hadlar rescued Dai
and his friends from King Vearn

00:11:42.404 --> 00:11:43.741
and let them escape.

00:11:43.774 --> 00:11:45.176
The act of a traitor.

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:48.684
As such, he must suffer
the greatest punishment.

00:11:48.717 --> 00:11:49.719
What?!

00:11:49.753 --> 00:11:51.556
Mystvearn: You will
not intervene.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:55.129
Witness the end
of your master.

00:11:55.162 --> 00:11:56.332
No! He can't!

00:11:56.365 --> 00:11:57.935
Lord Hadlar!

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.677
Hym [thought]: He's so fast!

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:04.916
Fare thee well, dear Hadlar.

00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:06.653
Hym [thought]: No, no!

00:12:06.686 --> 00:12:08.957
Everything is ending so fast...

00:12:08.991 --> 00:12:12.531
We still have not destroyed
the Disciples of Avan.

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:15.102
It can't end like this...

00:12:15.136 --> 00:12:17.006
It can't!

00:12:20.446 --> 00:12:21.816
W-What?!

00:12:23.019 --> 00:12:27.127
Well, I'd rather not be killed
by you for a second time.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.901
If you truly want to
take my life so badly...

00:12:30.935 --> 00:12:35.242
then I have no choice
but to strike you down!

00:12:37.815 --> 00:12:41.255
You will not
underestimate me...

00:12:41.289 --> 00:12:42.558
Dark King!

00:12:42.592 --> 00:12:44.996
[roaring]

00:13:03.365 --> 00:13:04.969
[pained groan]

00:13:06.205 --> 00:13:07.942
Vearn [thought]:
Impossible...

00:13:07.975 --> 00:13:11.381
How could he repel my attack?

00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:15.691
I gave him a body that
would grow more powerful

00:13:15.724 --> 00:13:18.664
each time he was resurrected.

00:13:18.697 --> 00:13:23.940
But he couldn't be resurrected
at all without my Dark Aura.

00:13:25.409 --> 00:13:30.086
Now that he has become one
of these "Superior Beings",

00:13:30.119 --> 00:13:33.993
I assumed that his access
to that power was lost!

00:13:34.027 --> 00:13:38.436
Yet he brought himself back
from the brink of death.

00:13:38.469 --> 00:13:42.210
And now it seems he
may actually have become

00:13:42.244 --> 00:13:46.218
strong enough to
rival me in battle!

00:13:47.354 --> 00:13:49.224
Mystvearn: Stop, Hadlar!

00:13:49.258 --> 00:13:52.898
Killvearn: Don't you care
what happens to your servants?

00:13:52.932 --> 00:13:54.669
I do not.

00:13:54.703 --> 00:13:57.106
So do what you will.

00:13:59.078 --> 00:14:00.981
If I am truly destroyed...

00:14:01.014 --> 00:14:04.020
None of them will
survive, anyways.

00:14:04.054 --> 00:14:07.394
The Hadlar Royal
Guard stands united,

00:14:07.427 --> 00:14:12.604
and our sole objective is to
defeat the Disciples of Avan!

00:14:14.274 --> 00:14:17.146
None of my
servants fear death,

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:20.486
so long as it
serves our purpose!

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.391
That's right.

00:14:22.424 --> 00:14:26.532
And very well said,
we're by your side.

00:14:26.566 --> 00:14:32.578
Vearn... You're the one...
who's dying today!

00:14:39.659 --> 00:14:43.734
Do you really believe that you
will be able to vanquish me

00:14:43.767 --> 00:14:47.107
with a meager increase
to your power?!

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:50.648
If it were just that,
I would doubt it.

00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:51.816
But...

00:14:51.849 --> 00:14:54.555
In your weakened state,
it's another story.

00:14:54.589 --> 00:14:55.657
Vearn: [struggling grunt]

00:14:55.691 --> 00:14:58.964
I assume that staff of yours
is absorbing Magic Power

00:14:58.997 --> 00:15:01.102
and converting it
into strength.

00:15:01.135 --> 00:15:03.105
So, simply holding it...

00:15:03.138 --> 00:15:06.913
Must drain your Magic
Power continuously!

00:15:09.017 --> 00:15:11.088
Vearn [thought]: I could
break the Sword of Dai,

00:15:11.121 --> 00:15:13.727
but not this
Orichalcum blade...

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.062
He's right.

00:15:15.096 --> 00:15:17.033
The fight against
Dai and his friends

00:15:17.067 --> 00:15:19.972
has left me with
little energy.

00:15:22.844 --> 00:15:24.882
It seems like
you've caught on.

00:15:24.915 --> 00:15:28.055
And because your
power is truly waning,

00:15:28.089 --> 00:15:30.059
in a clash of true might,

00:15:30.093 --> 00:15:32.731
I now have the advantage!

00:15:36.438 --> 00:15:37.474
Mystvearn: No...

00:15:37.508 --> 00:15:38.677
Sigma: Now, now...

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:41.081
If you release these bindings,

00:15:41.115 --> 00:15:44.354
Well, there's no telling
what we'd be able to do.

00:15:45.422 --> 00:15:46.192
[smug chuckle]

00:15:46.225 --> 00:15:48.128
Don't you want to find out?

00:15:48.162 --> 00:15:50.534
You can be quite
certain that...

00:15:50.567 --> 00:15:54.374
the instant you move,
you'll be burned to a crisp...

00:15:54.407 --> 00:15:56.880
Mister Reaper.

00:15:56.913 --> 00:15:59.518
Killvearn: You
arrogant little doll.

00:15:59.552 --> 00:16:01.087
[roaring]

00:16:12.678 --> 00:16:15.684
Kaiser Phoenix!

00:16:27.274 --> 00:16:31.750
Hadlar: Normally, that attack
would have reduced me to ashes.

00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:33.352
How many centuries
has it been

00:16:33.385 --> 00:16:36.125
since you've felt
this kind of weakness?

00:16:36.158 --> 00:16:37.661
[frustrated snarl]

00:16:39.264 --> 00:16:41.669
I will not miss my chance!

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.675
I'd like to see you try.

00:16:44.709 --> 00:16:47.013
[roaring]

00:16:47.046 --> 00:16:49.518
Hadlar: So long, King Vearn!

00:16:53.693 --> 00:16:54.695
But, that's...

00:16:54.729 --> 00:16:57.735
Zaboera: [cackling]

00:16:57.768 --> 00:16:58.937
Hadlar: Zaboera?!

00:16:58.971 --> 00:17:00.674
You dare ignore your debt

00:17:00.707 --> 00:17:04.314
for being made into a
Superior Being, old fool?!

00:17:05.818 --> 00:17:07.020
Zaboera: Don't bother.

00:17:07.053 --> 00:17:10.192
I may not be able to move,
but neither can you.

00:17:10.226 --> 00:17:12.063
Why, that parasite!

00:17:12.096 --> 00:17:15.102
Zaboera: Now's your
chance, my Dark King!

00:17:15.136 --> 00:17:18.209
Excellent work,
yet again, Zaboera.

00:17:18.242 --> 00:17:21.716
Hold him still and
I will make this quick.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.519
Yes, Sire!

00:17:25.824 --> 00:17:27.260
Hadlar - no!

00:17:27.293 --> 00:17:29.765
And now the tables have turned.

00:17:31.067 --> 00:17:33.171
C'mon, fight!

00:17:39.451 --> 00:17:42.123
Both: No!

00:17:43.627 --> 00:17:44.460
Block?!

00:17:57.988 --> 00:17:59.658
Where did he go?!

00:18:02.196 --> 00:18:04.200
W-What the...?!

00:18:06.506 --> 00:18:08.141
Block, no!

00:18:10.446 --> 00:18:11.783
Everyone...

00:18:11.816 --> 00:18:13.953
Just look after...

00:18:13.986 --> 00:18:15.422
Lord Hadlar...

00:18:19.966 --> 00:18:23.305
Block!

00:18:34.529 --> 00:18:36.098
You idiot!

00:18:36.131 --> 00:18:38.468
What could you possibly mean,
"Look after him"?

00:18:38.503 --> 00:18:42.611
How can those be the first words
you've ever said to us, huh?!

00:18:43.312 --> 00:18:45.583
Thank you, Block...

00:18:55.303 --> 00:18:57.508
Vearn: So, they've escaped.

00:18:57.541 --> 00:18:59.043
Killvearn: Who'd've
thought that the rook

00:18:59.077 --> 00:19:01.549
would have such a
trick up his sleeve?

00:19:01.582 --> 00:19:02.952
Vearn: The rook...

00:19:02.985 --> 00:19:04.889
Ah, yes.

00:19:04.923 --> 00:19:07.661
A castling maneuver.

00:19:07.695 --> 00:19:09.298
Mystvearn: Castling?

00:19:09.331 --> 00:19:11.401
In the game of chess,

00:19:11.435 --> 00:19:14.174
there is a move that allows
a player to rearrange

00:19:14.207 --> 00:19:17.648
the placement of the
king and rook pieces.

00:19:17.681 --> 00:19:21.656
That warrior was
born from a rook.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:27.601
It's no surprise that the piece
would possess such an ability.

00:19:27.635 --> 00:19:31.909
But I had just gotten
Hadlar into a checkmate.

00:19:33.579 --> 00:19:35.951
If this were a proper game...

00:19:35.984 --> 00:19:41.227
castling to escape a check...
would be a cowards move!

00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:55.355
Dai?! W-Where did he go?!

00:19:55.389 --> 00:19:57.894
I thought we all
fell together!

00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:01.569
Could he still - be...

00:20:09.384 --> 00:20:12.090
Popp: Is that what
Hyunckel talked about?!

00:20:12.123 --> 00:20:14.294
How interesting...

00:20:14.328 --> 00:20:16.431
The Holy Mother Dragon...

00:20:17.467 --> 00:20:19.337
Mystvearn: It's said
that she arrives

00:20:19.371 --> 00:20:23.011
only when the life of a
Dragon Knight has ended.

00:20:24.515 --> 00:20:27.888
Then that must mean...

00:20:27.921 --> 00:20:29.992
I am the victorious one.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:37.306
There, Popp. Look!

00:20:39.912 --> 00:20:40.513
Popp: Dai?!

00:20:40.547 --> 00:20:42.417
Gomechan: [forlorn chirp]

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:45.957
Wait, no! Dai isn't dead yet!

00:20:45.991 --> 00:20:47.026
Dai would-

00:20:47.059 --> 00:20:50.166
He can't be - there's no way!

00:20:50.199 --> 00:20:51.969
Please wait!

00:20:52.002 --> 00:20:55.543
Popp: Don't take
him away from us!

00:20:57.814 --> 00:20:59.317
What is that?

00:21:04.828 --> 00:21:06.766
Baduck: [coughing]

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:09.037
Their weapons?

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.074
Why would they return...

00:21:11.108 --> 00:21:14.681
to Sir Lon Beruk and
not their masters?

00:21:14.715 --> 00:21:17.888
Marin: Could Dai
and the others be...

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:27.306
I doubt that anyone else will
come to try and thwart my plans.

00:21:27.339 --> 00:21:29.845
Even if the legends are true,

00:21:29.879 --> 00:21:34.354
and the Holy Mother Dragon gives
birth to a new Dragon Knight,

00:21:34.388 --> 00:21:35.557
it will take decades

00:21:35.591 --> 00:21:39.397
before the inheritor to
the role is fully grown.

00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:42.102
Meanwhile, it will take
me less than ten days

00:21:42.136 --> 00:21:46.946
to reduce the Surface World
to nothing but ashes.

00:21:46.979 --> 00:21:48.683
We only need to be careful of

00:21:48.716 --> 00:21:52.456
any desperate
resistance from Hadlar.

00:21:53.593 --> 00:21:56.364
Come with me,
my loyal subjects.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:02.978
It's time to bring
ruin to this world.

00:23:37.567 --> 00:23:39.672
Narrator: Thanks to
Hadlar's surprise attack,

00:23:39.705 --> 00:23:41.843
our heroes escape King Vearn,

00:23:41.876 --> 00:23:45.283
but find themselves scattered
and heavy with defeat.

00:23:45.316 --> 00:23:47.688
With Dai under the
Mother Dragon's wing,

00:23:47.721 --> 00:23:50.459
Popp and Maam wash
ashore in Carl Kingdom.

00:23:50.493 --> 00:23:53.065
And while he prays for
his friends' survival,

00:23:53.098 --> 00:23:55.637
Popp learns that Vearn
has begun his siege

00:23:55.671 --> 00:23:57.607
against the Surface World.

00:23:57.641 --> 00:23:59.411
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:59.444 --> 00:24:02.216
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:02.249 --> 00:24:03.586
"The Survivors".
