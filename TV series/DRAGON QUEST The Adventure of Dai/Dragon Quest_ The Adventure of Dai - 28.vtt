WEBVTT

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.427
Merle: The Dragon
Knight is approaching.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.099
His Aura is full of wrath...

00:01:56.132 --> 00:01:57.636
And he's close!

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:58.872
Baran's found us?

00:01:58.905 --> 00:02:00.073
Crocodine: It seems so.

00:02:00.107 --> 00:02:02.713
The crests.
They're connected by them.

00:02:02.746 --> 00:02:05.217
Soon enough... He will
reach this castle.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.023
We must ready our defenses.

00:02:08.056 --> 00:02:09.359
Yes, indeed.

00:02:09.392 --> 00:02:11.229
Crocodine; I'm with you.

00:02:11.263 --> 00:02:12.765
We'll prepare what we can.

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.439
Madam Nabara and Merle
will stay here with Dai.

00:02:17.842 --> 00:02:19.211
Crocodine:
It's too dangerous.

00:02:19.245 --> 00:02:20.949
Remember what
happened last time?

00:02:20.982 --> 00:02:23.253
You cannot fight Baran alone.

00:02:23.286 --> 00:02:26.392
You're going to need
my Healing-type spells.

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.582
Crocodine: Very well, then.

00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:42.191
You're not one to be
talked out of your decisions.

00:02:42.224 --> 00:02:45.799
Yes, exactly. Now.
Let's get going.

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:48.637
Nabara, Merle, Listen;

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.543
You can't let Dai out of
his cell, no matter what.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.657
What is it, miss?

00:03:09.178 --> 00:03:10.982
Hey! Wh-what are you doing?

00:03:11.015 --> 00:03:12.117
Stand still.

00:03:12.151 --> 00:03:13.620
Huh? What is this thing?!

00:03:13.654 --> 00:03:17.360
A weapon. Use it to
defend yourself.

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:19.633
Defend myself?

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:21.302
Isn't it obvious?

00:03:21.336 --> 00:03:23.307
You use this... to fight.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.947
No, I can't. It's too scary.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.351
Dai: Please, miss.
Take it back!

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:53.066
Listen, I've told you before.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.070
You're a Hero, Dai!

00:03:55.103 --> 00:03:59.713
You're small, but... you're
brave, and bright, and sincere.

00:03:59.746 --> 00:04:02.318
That's what the
real you is like.

00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:05.323
But, this "cowardly"
you isn't a Hero...

00:04:05.356 --> 00:04:07.929
And it's not...
who you are!

00:04:08.931 --> 00:04:11.001
But that's... not true.

00:04:11.035 --> 00:04:13.974
How could I possibly
ever be a hero?

00:04:17.582 --> 00:04:23.093
And besides, if we just wait,
someone will come to protect me.

00:04:23.126 --> 00:04:24.361
[worried breaths]

00:04:24.394 --> 00:04:26.265
Crocodine [thought]: He
instinctively senses that

00:04:26.298 --> 00:04:29.471
Baran is his father after all.

00:04:30.373 --> 00:04:31.710
You're wrong.

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.481
That's the enemy!

00:04:35.183 --> 00:04:35.985
What?

00:04:36.019 --> 00:04:37.187
It's true.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.691
He's the one...

00:04:38.724 --> 00:04:42.297
who took all of your
precious memories of us.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.768
He's terrible!

00:04:43.801 --> 00:04:47.374
You should not be happy
that he's coming to find you.

00:04:47.876 --> 00:04:49.411
Princess...

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.518
You have to fight it, Dai!

00:04:52.552 --> 00:04:56.927
Fight to regain what was yours
-your memories, your courage.

00:04:58.731 --> 00:04:59.866
Courage...

00:05:01.402 --> 00:05:03.073
C'mon, Crocodine.

00:05:03.106 --> 00:05:04.576
Crocodine: Understood.

00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:12.124
Come to... think of it...

00:05:12.157 --> 00:05:17.802
Dai: Maybe... something
like this... happened before.

00:05:28.123 --> 00:05:30.026
So you aren't quite dead.

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:32.097
Well, I won't finish you off.

00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:36.574
You can bleed out wallowing
in shame, and regret.

00:05:36.607 --> 00:05:39.512
The boy, Dino, is
still to be reclaimed.

00:05:39.546 --> 00:05:42.585
I must hurry to
assist Master Baran.

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:44.856
Hyunckel [thought]: "Dino"?

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:46.826
Does he mean Dai?

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:51.335
Why... Do you still
bother to resist?

00:05:51.368 --> 00:05:56.780
Father or not... I can't...
let him take... Dai.

00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:00.854
Hyunckel: He is...

00:06:02.692 --> 00:06:04.094
He is...

00:06:04.128 --> 00:06:08.938
The last hope for all humans
still living in this world!

00:06:08.971 --> 00:06:09.839
[scoff]

00:06:09.873 --> 00:06:11.475
Nonsense.

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:14.348
The filthy humans
of this realm...

00:06:14.381 --> 00:06:16.921
don't deserve any
kind of savior.

00:06:16.954 --> 00:06:17.856
What?!

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:18.657
Larhart: You know what?

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.762
I shall tell
you before you die.

00:06:20.795 --> 00:06:25.638
The reason why... Master Baran
hates humans so much...

00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:29.579
is because the only
woman he ever loved,

00:06:29.613 --> 00:06:33.052
the mother of young
master Dino...

00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:36.526
was murdered by humans!

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.601
The ones who... killed
Dai's mother... were human?

00:06:40.634 --> 00:06:42.003
Why would they...

00:06:42.037 --> 00:06:43.807
Just who was this woman?!

00:06:50.454 --> 00:06:52.659
Now, you see, normally,

00:06:52.692 --> 00:06:56.032
only one Dragon Knight
can exist at a time.

00:06:56.065 --> 00:07:00.708
All of heaven and earth...
Can be shaped by their will.

00:07:00.742 --> 00:07:03.981
Therefore, only
one in a generation

00:07:04.014 --> 00:07:05.851
may possess this gift.

00:07:07.287 --> 00:07:09.826
When a Dragon
Knight's life ends,

00:07:09.859 --> 00:07:12.765
the Holy Mother Dragon appears.

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:15.303
It is said that
she caringly cradles

00:07:15.337 --> 00:07:16.940
the battle-weary knight...

00:07:18.811 --> 00:07:23.554
And having fulfilled it's duty,
the Dragon Crest is passed on

00:07:23.587 --> 00:07:27.828
to the life force the Mother
Dragon carries within her.

00:07:30.668 --> 00:07:33.272
She then travels to
a distant land

00:07:33.306 --> 00:07:35.645
and gives birth
to a new knight.

00:07:35.678 --> 00:07:37.715
The humans there
will worship the child

00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:41.455
as a divine being and
raise it as their own.

00:07:41.489 --> 00:07:44.395
And when the knight
is fully grown,

00:07:44.428 --> 00:07:47.234
it will awaken to it's duty.

00:07:47.267 --> 00:07:53.079
Thus, no Dragon Knight ever
knows parent or offspring.

00:07:53.113 --> 00:07:58.824
They are destined to a life
of never-ending battle.

00:07:58.858 --> 00:08:02.532
But something changed...
in Baran's generation.

00:08:02.566 --> 00:08:04.068
Fifteen years ago...

00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:05.838
[screaming]

00:08:05.871 --> 00:08:09.411
Larhart: When Hadlar
laid waste to the world,

00:08:09.444 --> 00:08:12.283
the Dragon Knight
did not appear.

00:08:13.854 --> 00:08:17.461
It was a human Hero who
defeated the Dark Lord.

00:08:17.494 --> 00:08:18.564
Avan...

00:08:18.597 --> 00:08:20.033
Larhart: At the time,

00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:24.341
Master Baran was fighting
an even greater threat.

00:08:24.374 --> 00:08:26.145
For it is a
Dragon Knight's duty

00:08:26.178 --> 00:08:30.922
to punish those who disrupt
the balance of the world.

00:08:30.955 --> 00:08:35.497
Compared to the danger of
Velzar, King of the Abyss,

00:08:35.531 --> 00:08:37.702
who was the last
intelligent dragon

00:08:37.735 --> 00:08:40.874
seeking to
conquer this world,

00:08:40.908 --> 00:08:44.916
even Hadlar was trivial
enough to be ignored.

00:08:46.786 --> 00:08:49.960
Master Baran vanquished
Velzar and his kin,

00:08:49.993 --> 00:08:53.767
but was mortally
wounded in the process.

00:08:53.801 --> 00:08:55.771
So with the last
of his strength,

00:08:55.804 --> 00:08:58.710
he journeyed to the
Fountain of Miracles,

00:08:58.744 --> 00:09:00.715
a place of legend
where it's said that

00:09:00.748 --> 00:09:03.620
Dragon Knights can be healed.

00:09:15.409 --> 00:09:16.913
I was close...

00:09:19.719 --> 00:09:21.388
Here, drink this.

00:09:21.422 --> 00:09:25.096
They say that it will heal all
kinds of wounds and sickness.

00:09:26.398 --> 00:09:28.202
A human woman?

00:09:32.177 --> 00:09:37.688
Larhart: That was how Master
Baran and Lady Soala first met.

00:09:40.093 --> 00:09:41.195
Weary from battle,

00:09:41.229 --> 00:09:45.605
the Dragon Knight found
the sun in Lady Soala.

00:09:45.638 --> 00:09:48.911
Eventually, love
blossomed between them.

00:09:48.944 --> 00:09:52.552
Soala was the princess
of Alkeed Kingdom,

00:09:52.585 --> 00:09:55.758
and when Master Baran
visited the palace,

00:09:55.792 --> 00:09:58.697
the two grew even closer.

00:09:58.731 --> 00:10:02.171
But there were vassals
who found this displeasing.

00:10:02.204 --> 00:10:04.475
They couldn't stand
the thought of a stranger

00:10:04.509 --> 00:10:06.747
winning claim to the throne.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.115
Chief Vassal: Your Majesty,

00:10:09.986 --> 00:10:12.926
there are rumors that
the knight is not human.

00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:14.161
W-What now?

00:10:14.194 --> 00:10:17.935
He may... have even
served the Dark Lord.

00:10:20.808 --> 00:10:24.481
Larhart: With the fear of
Hadlar still in recent memory,

00:10:24.516 --> 00:10:28.322
the humans banished
Master Baran.

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:34.134
Soala...

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:43.554
It would seem as though...

00:10:43.587 --> 00:10:47.026
life with a human was
never meant for me.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:50.233
My time with you
was a happy one.

00:10:51.302 --> 00:10:52.403
Farewell.

00:10:57.314 --> 00:10:58.315
Baran.

00:10:59.418 --> 00:11:02.858
Stop. Please...
Don't leave us.

00:11:03.794 --> 00:11:05.363
"Us"? You're saying-

00:11:05.396 --> 00:11:07.902
Soala, are you... with child?

00:11:09.138 --> 00:11:10.575
Can it be?

00:11:10.608 --> 00:11:12.712
That this
bloodstained slayer,

00:11:12.746 --> 00:11:17.153
the Dragon Knight,
truly sired a child?

00:11:30.447 --> 00:11:32.417
And so that child...

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:34.889
Is young Dino.

00:11:34.922 --> 00:11:37.529
Hyunckel [thought]:
Then Dai is the offspring of

00:11:37.562 --> 00:11:39.966
a Dragon Knight and a human?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.009
At first, they lived quietly,
deep in the forests of Teran.

00:11:46.513 --> 00:11:49.117
Baran: Soala, what
shall we name him?

00:11:51.823 --> 00:11:53.827
How about Dino?

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.569
It means "Strong Dragon,"
in the Alkeed language.

00:11:57.602 --> 00:12:01.075
That's good... little Dino!

00:12:01.108 --> 00:12:02.344
The dragon!

00:12:02.377 --> 00:12:02.978
Soala: Oh, dear...

00:12:03.012 --> 00:12:06.152
-[crying]
-[laughing]

00:12:06.185 --> 00:12:08.289
Don't worry, Dino.

00:12:08.323 --> 00:12:09.926
That was scary, wasn't it?

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.295
Larhart: But the humans...

00:12:11.328 --> 00:12:16.639
did not let them enjoy
their days of peace for long.

00:12:16.673 --> 00:12:18.710
A monster kidnapping
their princess

00:12:18.744 --> 00:12:20.881
would shame their country.

00:12:20.914 --> 00:12:23.186
Enraged, the king
hunted them down

00:12:23.219 --> 00:12:25.924
and had them surrounded
in their own home.

00:12:26.693 --> 00:12:27.493
Dai: [crying]

00:12:27.528 --> 00:12:28.998
My love...

00:12:29.031 --> 00:12:31.836
Baran [thought]:
I mustn't go too far here.

00:12:35.076 --> 00:12:37.615
Larhart: Master Baran
made his decision.

00:12:37.648 --> 00:12:39.284
Soala: Wait, my love!

00:12:40.486 --> 00:12:41.656
I surrender.

00:12:41.689 --> 00:12:45.697
But... no harm will
come to Soala or my son.

00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:46.900
All right.

00:12:46.934 --> 00:12:50.541
He is a monster's spawn,
but he's my grandson.

00:12:50.574 --> 00:12:52.545
Still, he cannot stay here,

00:12:52.578 --> 00:12:54.616
I shall send him
to a foreign land.

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:55.951
Larhart: Master Baran allowed

00:12:55.984 --> 00:12:58.823
the Alkeed soldiers
to take him prisoner...

00:12:59.926 --> 00:13:04.068
And Master Dino was
taken from Lady Soala,

00:13:04.101 --> 00:13:07.708
and sent to a faraway land.

00:13:07.741 --> 00:13:10.079
Chief Vassal: You are
sentenced to death!

00:13:10.112 --> 00:13:12.718
The sentence will
now be passed!

00:13:12.752 --> 00:13:14.856
Baran [thought]:
Soala... Dino...

00:13:14.889 --> 00:13:17.294
May you find happiness.

00:13:17.327 --> 00:13:18.897
Fire!

00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:22.337
Soala: No!

00:13:42.878 --> 00:13:45.483
[shocked gasps]

00:13:49.191 --> 00:13:50.426
Soala?

00:13:51.228 --> 00:13:52.230
Soala...

00:13:52.565 --> 00:13:54.033
Soala!

00:13:55.604 --> 00:13:58.042
M-My... love...

00:13:58.075 --> 00:13:59.177
No, why?

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:01.649
Why... Why would you do this?

00:14:01.683 --> 00:14:06.259
I... couldn't bear...
to see my...

00:14:06.292 --> 00:14:10.668
my father and the
others... continue...

00:14:10.701 --> 00:14:13.205
with such awful cruelty.

00:14:13.807 --> 00:14:15.343
Soala...

00:14:15.376 --> 00:14:19.051
Soala: But... Please
don't hate the humans.

00:14:19.084 --> 00:14:21.488
They're all just scared.

00:14:22.558 --> 00:14:24.929
Baran: Enough. Don't speak!

00:14:26.298 --> 00:14:28.035
P-Please...

00:14:28.436 --> 00:14:29.539
Dino...

00:14:29.572 --> 00:14:31.342
Go and find him...

00:14:31.375 --> 00:14:36.184
And then live...
together in... peace...

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:50.312
Soala?

00:14:51.415 --> 00:14:57.194
[heartbroken sobbing]

00:14:57.227 --> 00:14:59.698
Soala!

00:15:00.333 --> 00:15:01.468
How foolish.

00:15:01.502 --> 00:15:05.376
To die for a monster?!
What a disgrace!

00:15:05.977 --> 00:15:08.116
Her, a disgrace?

00:15:08.149 --> 00:15:10.453
Just who do
you think you are?

00:15:10.486 --> 00:15:15.162
Begone, humans! Begone!

00:15:18.168 --> 00:15:21.976
Larhart: Alkeed Kingdom
vanished from this world.

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.382
What horribly pathetic
and selfish creatures.

00:15:25.416 --> 00:15:28.188
And to think that I
once fought...

00:15:28.222 --> 00:15:32.932
the King of the Abyss
to protect those swine.

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:37.206
If I knew humans
were such filth...

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.412
I would have
let Velzar have them.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:45.691
Master Baran searched
around the world,

00:15:45.724 --> 00:15:48.730
but he could never find Dino.

00:15:48.764 --> 00:15:52.103
Apparently, the ship
was lost at sea.

00:15:52.805 --> 00:15:54.375
It was in his deepest despair,

00:15:54.408 --> 00:15:58.015
that the Dark King
Vearn approached him.

00:15:58.048 --> 00:16:01.556
He agreed that humanity
should be destroyed for good.

00:16:01.589 --> 00:16:06.632
I'm the only one Master Baran
has ever told this sad tale.

00:16:07.769 --> 00:16:10.808
What? You'll still fight?

00:16:10.841 --> 00:16:14.447
Hyunckel: Larhart,
you are indeed powerful.

00:16:14.481 --> 00:16:17.688
I doubt I even have the
strength left to stand.

00:16:19.057 --> 00:16:21.763
But, after hearing that story,

00:16:21.796 --> 00:16:25.202
I know that I have
to get back up.

00:16:25.236 --> 00:16:28.509
For Dai... and for Baran!

00:16:44.608 --> 00:16:46.378
For Master Baran?

00:16:46.411 --> 00:16:49.753
I know... very
well how he feels.

00:16:49.786 --> 00:16:51.121
What?!

00:16:51.154 --> 00:16:54.729
Hyunckel: I, too, once lost
faith in the human world.

00:16:54.762 --> 00:16:57.500
I sold my soul
to the Dark Army,

00:16:57.535 --> 00:17:00.775
and sought to
destroy everything.

00:17:00.808 --> 00:17:02.377
But then I realized...

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:06.251
No, my friends
made me realize...

00:17:06.284 --> 00:17:11.095
That there is... still hope
left for the human world.

00:17:11.128 --> 00:17:12.798
And so now,

00:17:12.832 --> 00:17:13.600
My duty...

00:17:13.633 --> 00:17:15.971
Is to help Baran see it.

00:17:16.005 --> 00:17:18.208
Help him see the truth...

00:17:19.043 --> 00:17:21.281
What could you possibly know?

00:17:21.315 --> 00:17:23.452
You think that
my master's pain...

00:17:23.485 --> 00:17:27.528
is something so light that
you can help him lift it?!

00:17:27.562 --> 00:17:29.330
Don't make me laugh!

00:17:32.571 --> 00:17:35.476
But how? I aimed
straight for your heart.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.981
I can see through
your attacks.

00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:39.318
You what?

00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:43.059
Hyunckel: To be honest,
while I was dealing with you,

00:17:43.092 --> 00:17:46.398
I was saving my
energy to fight Baran.

00:17:46.866 --> 00:17:47.902
That's why...

00:17:47.935 --> 00:17:50.039
Whenever you attacked,
or got close,

00:17:50.073 --> 00:17:53.580
I was strictly focused
on keeping my distance.

00:17:53.614 --> 00:17:55.083
Until now.

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:56.451
It makes no difference to me

00:17:56.485 --> 00:17:59.424
whether you manage to
land an attack or not.

00:17:59.457 --> 00:18:02.765
And that freedom is
what allows me to dodge...

00:18:02.798 --> 00:18:04.502
any of your fatal blows!

00:18:04.535 --> 00:18:06.338
You bastard!

00:18:44.882 --> 00:18:46.151
[furious roar]

00:18:46.185 --> 00:18:48.556
[roaring]

00:18:49.224 --> 00:18:50.025
Where did...

00:18:50.059 --> 00:18:51.529
this strength come from?!

00:18:51.562 --> 00:18:53.734
And you're faster now, as well!

00:18:53.767 --> 00:18:57.908
It's the power a human
wields when risking his life!

00:18:57.941 --> 00:18:59.712
Larhart: I won't accept that!

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.370
[pained groan]

00:19:21.321 --> 00:19:25.395
It was wise of you to
bring the fight in so close.

00:19:25.429 --> 00:19:29.838
But once distance is gained,
a sword cannot beat a spear.

00:19:29.872 --> 00:19:33.479
I highly doubt you have
the energy to even move.

00:19:33.513 --> 00:19:37.253
I could end this with
a single thrust...

00:19:38.388 --> 00:19:40.694
But that won't
satisfy my anger!

00:19:40.728 --> 00:19:42.764
Hyunckel [thought]:
His Sunder Claw...

00:19:42.798 --> 00:19:46.939
Feel the sting of...
my claw once more.

00:19:48.242 --> 00:19:51.314
As punishment for
your foolishness...

00:19:51.348 --> 00:19:53.318
die a painful death!

00:19:54.822 --> 00:19:58.930
Sunder Claw!

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:00.600
Gotcha.

00:20:00.633 --> 00:20:02.103
Looks like...

00:20:02.136 --> 00:20:05.476
You fell for my final
life-risking trap!

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:06.411
What?!

00:20:07.514 --> 00:20:09.284
Hyunckel:
Take a good look at

00:20:09.317 --> 00:20:12.356
the Aura that our
weapons create!

00:20:13.726 --> 00:20:15.563
What - a cross?!

00:20:17.233 --> 00:20:19.103
Hyunckel: Grand Cross!

00:20:19.136 --> 00:20:20.172
Larhart [thought]:
Impossible...

00:20:20.205 --> 00:20:22.276
[defeated roar]

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:26.986
Larhart [thought]: He was hiding
a weapon charged with his Aura?!

00:20:29.423 --> 00:20:32.363
But he was
completely defenseless!

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:49.832
Wh-Where did you hide...
such a weapon?!

00:20:49.865 --> 00:20:53.873
This was... the only
thing that I had left.

00:20:56.579 --> 00:21:00.085
T-That... flimsy...
little chain?

00:21:00.119 --> 00:21:03.325
This chain...
will not break.

00:21:03.359 --> 00:21:06.265
It's a symbol,
of the bond...

00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:09.271
Between the
Disciples of Avan!

00:21:09.304 --> 00:21:11.407
The bond...

00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:27.406
Using... that Grand Cross
is going to leave me...

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.377
weak for a... while.

00:21:33.184 --> 00:21:35.757
You're...
You're... still alive?

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:44.307
All right. This time
I'll go right for your head.

00:21:44.741 --> 00:21:45.611
[grim chuckle]

00:21:45.644 --> 00:21:46.912
Not so fast.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:50.052
Hyunckel: Popp!

00:21:50.085 --> 00:21:51.922
Borahorn: Drop your weapon.

00:21:51.956 --> 00:21:55.997
Otherwise, he's the one
who'll lose his head.

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:57.333
You scoundrel!

00:21:59.003 --> 00:22:00.941
[pained scream]

00:22:00.974 --> 00:22:04.046
Let him go!

00:23:38.102 --> 00:23:39.538
Narrator: After
a fierce battle,

00:23:39.571 --> 00:23:44.214
Larhart entrusts Hyunckel
and Popp with a final wish.

00:23:44.247 --> 00:23:46.886
Meanwhile, Baran
arrives at Teran Castle,

00:23:46.919 --> 00:23:51.061
And Crocodine risks it all
to face the Dragon Master...

00:23:51.094 --> 00:23:56.437
But soon Baran reveals the true
power of his grief and fury.

00:23:56.471 --> 00:23:57.975
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:58.008 --> 00:24:01.081
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:01.114 --> 00:24:02.984
"Baran's Rage".
