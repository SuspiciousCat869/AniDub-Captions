WEBVTT

00:01:53.628 --> 00:01:56.734
King Romos: Princess Leona
is calling for a world summit.

00:01:56.767 --> 00:01:59.773
My presence has been
requested in Papnica.

00:01:59.806 --> 00:02:00.808
World summit?

00:02:00.842 --> 00:02:02.077
King Romos: That's right.

00:02:02.111 --> 00:02:05.317
She's gathering the kings and
queens and leaders of humanity

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.123
to strategize for a battle
against the Dark Army.

00:02:08.157 --> 00:02:10.862
So that's her plan.

00:02:10.896 --> 00:02:14.068
The kingdoms have made almost
no effort at working together

00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:17.341
and the enemy has
exploited this weakness.

00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:23.353
As a result, Orzam, Ringaia, and
Carl have all been overtaken.

00:02:23.386 --> 00:02:25.591
But, with the call
of Princess Leona,

00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:27.995
the remaining kingdoms have
decided to collaborate

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:31.570
and form a joint strategy
to face the Dark Army as one-

00:02:31.604 --> 00:02:34.041
an act that we realize
should have been done sooner

00:02:34.075 --> 00:02:36.046
to avoid our current mess.

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.649
Amazing!

00:02:37.682 --> 00:02:39.619
I'll say. That's huge!

00:02:40.655 --> 00:02:44.395
She's doing what she set
out to do. That's Leona.

00:02:44.428 --> 00:02:47.234
An excellent idea.
When will it be, your highness?

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:48.671
King Romos:
Three days from now,

00:02:48.704 --> 00:02:51.442
and it'll take that long
to get all the way there.

00:02:51.476 --> 00:02:54.716
I was planning to leave this
evening, but Dai, my boy...

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.853
King Romos: Would
you care to join me?

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.431
Listen; people from all
of the world's kingdoms

00:03:02.465 --> 00:03:04.035
are going to be attending.

00:03:04.068 --> 00:03:07.676
What if someone there knows
about another legendary weapon?

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:08.744
That's true!

00:03:08.777 --> 00:03:10.982
Your Majesty, we'll leave
for Papnica right away

00:03:11.015 --> 00:03:12.752
using Popp's Zoom spell.

00:03:12.785 --> 00:03:14.623
Very well, then.

00:03:14.656 --> 00:03:15.291
Alrighty...

00:03:15.324 --> 00:03:16.526
Larba: Wait a minute.

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:18.964
Thank you.

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:23.439
Without your help, none
of us would have made it.

00:03:25.176 --> 00:03:27.114
Larba: You're a
true Hero indeed.

00:03:27.147 --> 00:03:30.688
[chattering]

00:03:30.722 --> 00:03:33.126
Baloria: We'll start training
for this upcoming showdown

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.529
with the Dark Army.

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:37.902
Chiu [thought]: What gives?!

00:03:37.936 --> 00:03:41.577
Even after my amazing
performance out there...

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.117
You jerks! I was part of
that battle, too, y'know!

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.352
Brokeena: Stop it!

00:03:46.987 --> 00:03:48.223
Why, you...

00:03:48.256 --> 00:03:50.059
Brokeena: Enough. You're
making a fool of yourself.

00:03:50.093 --> 00:03:53.266
How dare you-
y-you stupid ghost!

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.236
I don't think
you have the right

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.974
to talk down to
someone like me!

00:03:57.007 --> 00:03:58.844
Brokeena: Oh? Are you sure?

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:00.147
W-What?!

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.583
Maam: [chucking]

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:02.985
Can't you tell?

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.090
That "ghost" is
Master Brokeena.

00:04:05.123 --> 00:04:06.526
What?!

00:04:15.277 --> 00:04:16.412
Forgive me!

00:04:16.445 --> 00:04:19.018
This old man is the
"Martial Arts" master?!

00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:20.822
Brokeena the Holy Fist!

00:04:20.855 --> 00:04:23.426
But, Master - why were
you in disguise?!

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.898
I just wanted to see
how the two of you

00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:27.000
would do in
the tournament.

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:29.940
Both of them are really
students of the Holy Fist?

00:04:29.973 --> 00:04:32.612
I didn't expect everything
to go the way it did,

00:04:32.645 --> 00:04:36.118
but in the end I still got to
see the well-earned results

00:04:36.152 --> 00:04:37.387
of Maam's training.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.360
Chiu [thought]:
I'm gonna get in trouble...

00:04:40.393 --> 00:04:42.665
Brokeena: The experience
was good for you as well,

00:04:42.698 --> 00:04:44.335
wasn't it, Chiu?

00:04:44.368 --> 00:04:46.339
It's been three
years of training.

00:04:46.372 --> 00:04:47.675
Progress was slow

00:04:47.708 --> 00:04:49.779
and your showing off
definitely didn't help,

00:04:49.813 --> 00:04:52.719
so it might have taken
a bit longer than I'd like.

00:04:52.752 --> 00:04:56.292
But it seems all you needed was
to be backed into a corner.

00:04:56.326 --> 00:04:59.298
Your new move
is quite impressive.

00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:01.703
I would actually say
that you've grown.

00:05:01.736 --> 00:05:02.772
You think so?

00:05:02.805 --> 00:05:05.077
Gomez: You're a
proper hero, too.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.349
You've got real guts, friend-
more than we expected!

00:05:08.383 --> 00:05:11.256
[laughing]

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:12.792
You guys...

00:05:13.561 --> 00:05:15.296
That's just how it is, Chiu.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.803
Fame may follow you
later on in life,

00:05:17.836 --> 00:05:20.674
but you must never
seek it for yourself.

00:05:22.143 --> 00:05:23.881
Grand Master!

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:26.787
[crying]

00:05:26.821 --> 00:05:28.123
He's a good teacher.

00:05:28.156 --> 00:05:29.391
Yeah.

00:05:29.425 --> 00:05:31.462
Well, should we go?

00:05:35.905 --> 00:05:39.979
Master, I'd really like to
travel with Miss Maam. May I?

00:05:40.013 --> 00:05:44.154
Go ahead. But maybe ask
them for permission, first.

00:05:44.187 --> 00:05:46.058
Chiu: I thank you
for everything!

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:50.133
Chiu: Hey!
Wait up, you three!

00:05:50.166 --> 00:05:51.435
Maam: Chiu?

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:54.642
Chiu: If you insist,
I would be willing to help...

00:05:55.143 --> 00:05:55.978
And, Zoom.

00:05:56.947 --> 00:05:58.650
Huh?! Hey...

00:05:59.318 --> 00:06:01.155
Wait for me!

00:06:02.124 --> 00:06:03.059
Aw, Popp...

00:06:03.093 --> 00:06:05.531
That was kinda mean.

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:09.104
Well, he hasn't exactly learned
to be humble, now has he?

00:06:09.137 --> 00:06:12.779
Maybe. Still, he's an
interesting guy. I think.

00:06:12.812 --> 00:06:14.281
Please, wait!

00:06:14.315 --> 00:06:16.252
Just looking at him,

00:06:16.285 --> 00:06:18.456
all of my worries
about being human or not

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.561
seem almost insignificant.

00:06:20.594 --> 00:06:22.965
He's a good
example to live by.

00:06:24.202 --> 00:06:27.842
I s'pose... it might be nice to
bring someone like him along.

00:06:27.875 --> 00:06:32.450
Chiu: C'mon, please!
Let me join your party!

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:41.468
Zaboera: Mystvearn...
How did you find this place?!

00:06:41.503 --> 00:06:44.141
Mystvearn: I thought you
might be hiding out here...

00:06:44.175 --> 00:06:46.613
Quite close to
the Field of Death.

00:06:47.247 --> 00:06:49.085
Where is Hadlar?

00:06:49.118 --> 00:06:50.487
Well, he's, ah...

00:06:50.521 --> 00:06:51.856
Mystvearn: Where is he?

00:06:52.625 --> 00:06:54.963
Hadlar: Zaboera, let him in.

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:58.035
But Lord Hadlar...

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:00.975
Hadlar: It matters not.
I need to speak to him.

00:07:08.957 --> 00:07:11.663
Quite pathetic,
wouldn't you say?

00:07:11.697 --> 00:07:15.002
A Darkling like me
defeated so quickly-

00:07:15.036 --> 00:07:18.944
his last chance at finally
defeating the little Hero, Dai.

00:07:20.179 --> 00:07:21.650
You, Mystvearn,

00:07:21.684 --> 00:07:25.725
you are our King's most
trusted vassal and warrior.

00:07:25.758 --> 00:07:28.864
I'm aware that while
you might serve under me,

00:07:28.897 --> 00:07:32.906
you still wield the greater
authority within the Dark Army.

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:35.911
Hadlar: If you wish to inform
King Vearn of my defeat,

00:07:35.945 --> 00:07:37.113
so be it.

00:07:37.147 --> 00:07:41.690
But, still. I may have no
right, but I request a favor.

00:07:41.723 --> 00:07:44.662
During my Superior
Being Transformation,

00:07:44.695 --> 00:07:47.902
I need you to go
fight in my place.

00:07:48.804 --> 00:07:51.041
The process is
almost complete.

00:07:51.075 --> 00:07:55.751
However, my spies tell me the
humans are up to something big.

00:07:55.784 --> 00:07:59.257
I've learned that leaders
from the remaining kingdoms

00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:02.497
are quietly
gathering in Papnica.

00:08:02.531 --> 00:08:05.236
Mystvearn: And you want
me to destroy them?

00:08:05.269 --> 00:08:06.940
To buy you time?

00:08:09.378 --> 00:08:11.549
Mystvearn: Will that
serve King Vearn?

00:08:11.583 --> 00:08:14.856
I know of Zamza's defeat.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:18.263
Mystvearn: The Superior Beings
are an ongoing experiment.

00:08:18.296 --> 00:08:20.367
They cannot wield magic.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.672
Your concerns have
already been addressed

00:08:22.706 --> 00:08:24.709
in this latest iteration.

00:08:24.743 --> 00:08:27.782
In our previous attempts, all
magical power was lost in the

00:08:27.816 --> 00:08:32.958
transformation from Darkling to
Superior Being, yes? But now...

00:08:32.992 --> 00:08:35.130
Now we have finally
done away with

00:08:35.163 --> 00:08:37.267
the transformation altogether.

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.737
Mystvearn: What?

00:08:38.771 --> 00:08:42.511
Hadlar, you're saying that you
will abandon your Darkling body

00:08:42.545 --> 00:08:45.918
to permanently become
one of these monsters?

00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:47.121
Indeed.

00:08:47.154 --> 00:08:49.424
Mystvearn: You'll
lose your immortality.

00:08:49.458 --> 00:08:51.195
You understand that?

00:08:51.228 --> 00:08:52.599
The Disciples of Avan

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:55.036
are enemies worthy
of that sacrifice.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:58.342
I have come to realize
that truth over time.

00:08:58.375 --> 00:09:03.452
I no longer desire status
or honor or even this life.

00:09:03.486 --> 00:09:05.858
I want nothing
but to defeat them,

00:09:05.891 --> 00:09:10.333
no matter what it may cost,
or my life will mean nothing.

00:09:13.106 --> 00:09:14.007
Mystvearn: Very well.

00:09:15.143 --> 00:09:18.015
Mystvearn: Hadlar, despite
having your powerful body

00:09:18.049 --> 00:09:21.923
and it's abilities, the reason
the Disciples of Avan continued

00:09:21.956 --> 00:09:26.432
to beat you was your pride
and your lack of will.

00:09:26.466 --> 00:09:29.071
But since you have
cast those aside...

00:09:29.104 --> 00:09:32.444
And having overcome your
greatest weaknesses,

00:09:32.477 --> 00:09:36.486
you shall become
the fiercest warrior.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.322
King Vearn will be pleased.

00:09:38.356 --> 00:09:40.326
Leave Papnica to me.

00:09:41.362 --> 00:09:42.765
Thank you.

00:09:46.071 --> 00:09:48.877
But can Mystvearn
really be trusted?

00:09:48.911 --> 00:09:51.649
We have no other options.

00:09:51.683 --> 00:09:54.555
I need time more
than anything else.

00:09:54.589 --> 00:09:56.893
If I am to be given
one final chance,

00:09:56.927 --> 00:10:00.099
I will take it from
whoever gives it.

00:10:05.409 --> 00:10:09.285
Woah! What a
lovely country, huh?

00:10:09.318 --> 00:10:10.153
Crocodine: Hey...

00:10:10.187 --> 00:10:10.855
[surprised breaths]

00:10:10.888 --> 00:10:12.525
Crocodine: You're back!

00:10:12.558 --> 00:10:14.027
[terrified scream]

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.436
Chiu [thought]: Wh-what is
this horrifying creature?!

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:19.471
Crocodine!

00:10:19.505 --> 00:10:20.641
[delighted laugh]

00:10:20.674 --> 00:10:21.743
Hello, Maam.

00:10:21.777 --> 00:10:24.314
We got word.
Your skills have improved.

00:10:24.348 --> 00:10:27.320
It seems we may have a
new Beast King on our side.

00:10:27.354 --> 00:10:30.728
I don't think many women would
like being compared to a beast.

00:10:30.762 --> 00:10:32.264
But I know what you mean.

00:10:32.297 --> 00:10:33.332
[chuckling]

00:10:33.365 --> 00:10:34.836
Sorry, sorry.

00:10:39.445 --> 00:10:41.249
Who is this new friend?

00:10:41.282 --> 00:10:42.852
Oh, his name is Chiu.

00:10:42.885 --> 00:10:45.289
He's a fellow student.

00:10:51.803 --> 00:10:54.609
Are you sure this little rat
is up to joining our party?

00:10:54.642 --> 00:10:57.213
He doesn't seem very tough.

00:10:57.247 --> 00:10:59.986
Chiu [thought]: Where did
Miss Maam meet all these guys?

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:04.528
Now, now, Crocodine. He actually
helped us out quite a bit.

00:11:04.562 --> 00:11:09.138
Chiu [thought]: Look at them.
She's not very discerning.

00:11:09.171 --> 00:11:11.810
So, uh, where's the
princess and everyone?

00:11:11.843 --> 00:11:15.818
Ah, the world summit...
It's over there.

00:11:15.852 --> 00:11:18.389
The Papnica Grand Chapel.

00:11:18.423 --> 00:11:20.426
They're gathering inside.

00:11:30.714 --> 00:11:33.185
Killvearn: How surprisingly
considerate of Myst

00:11:33.219 --> 00:11:36.627
to show such
leniency with Hadlar.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.162
You said it!

00:11:38.195 --> 00:11:41.168
Killvearn: But, if he's
holding the Key of Vearn,

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:43.239
it means that
the king is aware

00:11:43.272 --> 00:11:45.912
and allowing the
attack to go ahead...

00:11:45.945 --> 00:11:48.482
Very curious, indeed.

00:12:07.622 --> 00:12:09.959
You guys, welcome back!

00:12:11.161 --> 00:12:12.865
Oh, and Maam!

00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:15.136
Maam: Leona!

00:12:15.169 --> 00:12:18.409
I see you've gotten
stronger. I'm impressed.

00:12:18.443 --> 00:12:20.113
Well, I'm even
more impressed.

00:12:20.147 --> 00:12:23.887
It's amazing - uniting all the
leaders from around the world?!

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.258
Well, sadly, it
won't be everyone.

00:12:26.292 --> 00:12:30.166
We've still heard very little
from the fallen kingdoms.

00:12:30.199 --> 00:12:34.843
From Ringaia, General Bowson is
the only one able to attend.

00:12:34.876 --> 00:12:37.515
We couldn't find anyone
to represent Orzam.

00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:39.318
And plenty are still missing.

00:12:39.351 --> 00:12:42.257
Queen Flora from the
Carl Kingdom among them.

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:43.560
Don't worry.

00:12:43.593 --> 00:12:47.401
She's well known for being
a bold and courageous woman.

00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:49.237
I know she's fine.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.643
Someone bolder
than the Princess?

00:12:51.676 --> 00:12:54.347
She must be even
tougher than Dai.

00:12:54.381 --> 00:12:55.851
Hey, I heard that, dummy.

00:12:55.884 --> 00:12:57.588
Popp: Did I say it out loud?

00:12:57.621 --> 00:12:58.724
Leona: No, I'm
reading your mind.

00:12:58.757 --> 00:13:00.527
Do you think anyone
who came might know

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.464
something about
Legendary weapons?

00:13:02.497 --> 00:13:04.000
Apollo: Well, maybe...

00:13:04.034 --> 00:13:06.238
Ask King Volken of Teran.

00:13:06.271 --> 00:13:08.943
He's well-known
for his knowledge.

00:13:10.547 --> 00:13:14.354
A blade stronger than
the Sword of Champions...

00:13:14.387 --> 00:13:17.260
It's unlikely.

00:13:17.293 --> 00:13:20.667
The metal, Orichalcum, that
was used to forge that sword,

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.774
was created by
the gods ages ago.

00:13:23.807 --> 00:13:26.679
You see, only a small
amount was given to humans

00:13:26.713 --> 00:13:28.917
and made into
legendary equipment.

00:13:28.951 --> 00:13:31.188
But - the Demon
Dragon Blade...

00:13:31.221 --> 00:13:34.160
It's said the gods
forged that blade.

00:13:34.194 --> 00:13:37.535
It is not a sword that
was created by human hands.

00:13:37.568 --> 00:13:38.870
I see.

00:13:40.039 --> 00:13:42.878
But there must be
other powerful swords?

00:13:43.747 --> 00:13:45.016
Summon Merle.

00:13:45.049 --> 00:13:48.155
Dai: Huh? Merle's in Papnica?!

00:13:54.869 --> 00:13:56.238
[chuckling]

00:13:56.271 --> 00:13:58.308
Merle [thought]: I get to help
Popp and the others already.

00:13:59.546 --> 00:14:04.154
Merle: So Dai, first
visualize the object you seek.

00:14:04.187 --> 00:14:07.561
Then when I tell you,
drop that flame.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.616
And now.

00:14:24.261 --> 00:14:28.202
Merle: La...
n... kir... ks...

00:14:29.573 --> 00:14:30.941
What does that mean?

00:14:30.974 --> 00:14:32.476
Lankirks Village.

00:14:32.511 --> 00:14:35.718
It's a small village that
lies to the east of the Teran

00:14:35.751 --> 00:14:37.855
and Bengarna Kingdoms.

00:14:37.889 --> 00:14:39.491
Now are we supposed
to get there?

00:14:39.525 --> 00:14:42.030
Maybe we can borrow
Leona's Balloon Ship?

00:14:42.063 --> 00:14:44.869
Could a Zoom
spell get us close?

00:14:44.902 --> 00:14:47.675
Popp: A Zoom spell
will get us straight there.

00:14:47.708 --> 00:14:48.977
Huh?! Really?!

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:52.216
Popp? You've really
been to this place before?

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.090
Popp: I didn't
go there. I left it.

00:14:55.123 --> 00:14:56.793
It's where I was born.

00:14:56.826 --> 00:14:58.830
You mean it's your
home village?!

00:14:58.863 --> 00:15:01.335
Your family runs
a weapon store...

00:15:01.368 --> 00:15:03.238
That must be it!

00:15:03.272 --> 00:15:06.178
Popp: The thing is, I
actually ran away from home

00:15:06.211 --> 00:15:07.882
to be Master
Avan's student...

00:15:07.915 --> 00:15:10.119
[frustrated sigh]

00:15:16.633 --> 00:15:19.673
All: [pained groans]

00:15:19.706 --> 00:15:21.877
What a terrible landing.

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:25.182
Don't blame me.
I'm carrying all you guys!

00:15:25.818 --> 00:15:26.886
Maam: Sorry about him.

00:15:26.919 --> 00:15:28.623
We're grateful
to have you here.

00:15:28.657 --> 00:15:32.364
It's a relief to have someone
with so much knowledge with us.

00:15:32.397 --> 00:15:36.506
Thanks. I really hope you're
right - I want to be helpful.

00:15:37.006 --> 00:15:38.275
Popp: This way.

00:15:42.752 --> 00:15:44.188
Merle [thought]:
Thank goodness.

00:15:44.221 --> 00:15:47.528
She's nothing like
that imposter we met.

00:15:47.562 --> 00:15:49.932
She's kind and warm.

00:15:49.965 --> 00:15:53.305
I can see why Popp likes her.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.051
Seems like a nice
place, doesn't it?

00:15:59.084 --> 00:16:03.091
It's a tiny village.
Nothing's really changed.

00:16:07.567 --> 00:16:11.576
Popp: The shop's up ahead.
I'll be waiting right here.

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:13.012
You aren't coming with us?

00:16:13.045 --> 00:16:15.316
Popp: If my Dad
sees me, it'll be bad.

00:16:15.349 --> 00:16:17.889
Hey - does that lady
work in the weapon shop?

00:16:17.922 --> 00:16:19.057
Popp: Huh?!

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.075
M-Mom!

00:16:28.677 --> 00:16:30.146
P-Popp?

00:16:30.179 --> 00:16:31.516
Is it really you?!

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:33.418
Huh? Uh...

00:16:34.522 --> 00:16:36.124
It's my boy!

00:16:39.699 --> 00:16:40.600
Mom!

00:16:41.067 --> 00:16:42.638
Stein: Oh, Popp!

00:16:42.671 --> 00:16:43.607
Mom, I'm sorry!

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.513
-Popp: I'm so sorry!
-Stein: It's okay, Popp.

00:16:46.546 --> 00:16:48.181
That's nice.

00:16:48.215 --> 00:16:51.288
Looks like he must be really
close with his family.

00:16:54.662 --> 00:16:56.365
Popp: Dad?!

00:16:56.399 --> 00:16:59.939
Honey, look who made
his way back home!

00:16:59.973 --> 00:17:01.509
Hey, son.

00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:05.784
Hi, Dad.

00:17:08.523 --> 00:17:11.428
Jank: You run off without
a word for over a year!

00:17:11.461 --> 00:17:15.036
You think you can just waltz
back like nothing's happened?!

00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:16.372
You ungrateful brat!

00:17:16.405 --> 00:17:17.206
[shrieking]

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.777
Stein: Honey, stop!

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:20.112
Mister, calm down!

00:17:20.145 --> 00:17:22.818
-[screaming]
-[angry yelling]

00:17:27.828 --> 00:17:29.131
Jank: Apologies.

00:17:29.164 --> 00:17:32.036
We don't normally get
visitors in our small village.

00:17:32.069 --> 00:17:34.174
I can't believe my
idiot son is actually helping

00:17:34.207 --> 00:17:36.713
the legendary Hero
on his quest.

00:17:36.746 --> 00:17:38.717
He's done more than just help.

00:17:38.751 --> 00:17:39.752
We trained together.

00:17:39.785 --> 00:17:42.089
I really don't know where
I'd be without him.

00:17:42.123 --> 00:17:44.027
He's our most
reliable friend!

00:17:44.061 --> 00:17:45.229
Oh?

00:17:45.263 --> 00:17:48.035
So, uh... mister,
what we were asking about?

00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:50.139
Right. You want
a legendary sword.

00:17:50.173 --> 00:17:52.344
Well, you won't
find one in my shop.

00:17:52.377 --> 00:17:54.181
But it's possible
there's something out at

00:17:54.214 --> 00:17:55.750
my friend Lon's place.

00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:56.752
Lon?

00:17:56.786 --> 00:17:58.823
A Darkling that
I met recently.

00:17:58.857 --> 00:18:02.865
Darkling - their name doesn't
happen to be Lon Beruk, does it?

00:18:02.898 --> 00:18:04.568
Jank: Sure. So?

00:18:04.601 --> 00:18:05.436
You know him?

00:18:05.469 --> 00:18:07.239
Popp: Well, if I'm right...

00:18:07.273 --> 00:18:09.712
Those Dark Armor weapons
that Hyunckel uses were made

00:18:09.745 --> 00:18:13.720
ages ago by a guy with
the same name; Lon Beruk!

00:18:13.753 --> 00:18:14.388
That means...

00:18:14.421 --> 00:18:16.593
Popp: Yeah, he can help us!

00:18:16.626 --> 00:18:18.128
Jank: Don't be so sure.

00:18:18.162 --> 00:18:21.168
He lives in the woods
just outside of the village.

00:18:21.201 --> 00:18:23.873
He's not interested
in meeting new people.

00:18:28.482 --> 00:18:29.151
Lon: Go away.

00:18:29.184 --> 00:18:30.319
[disappointed groans]

00:18:30.352 --> 00:18:32.090
I no longer see the
point in crafting these

00:18:32.124 --> 00:18:34.093
"legendary" weapons.

00:18:34.127 --> 00:18:36.298
Much less a fool's
errand like attempting to

00:18:36.331 --> 00:18:38.503
forge the world's
greatest sword.

00:18:38.536 --> 00:18:39.237
Wait, but...

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:40.574
You see, Hero;

00:18:40.607 --> 00:18:43.012
my interests lie solely in how
the weapons that I make

00:18:43.045 --> 00:18:44.715
perform on the battlefield.

00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:49.357
But recently, there's been
no one worthy of wielding them.

00:18:49.391 --> 00:18:51.328
No matter how
powerful the weapon,

00:18:51.361 --> 00:18:53.065
if the wielder
doesn't have the skill,

00:18:53.098 --> 00:18:55.369
it's nothing but an ornament.

00:18:55.402 --> 00:18:57.106
You see those
swords over there?

00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:59.244
I forged them
to pay for my meals,

00:18:59.278 --> 00:19:00.948
but they're better
than a normal blade.

00:19:00.981 --> 00:19:02.784
Just take one and leave.

00:19:20.687 --> 00:19:23.192
Dai: "Better than normal"
isn't enough.

00:19:23.225 --> 00:19:24.460
Even your Dark Armour Blade

00:19:24.494 --> 00:19:27.200
couldn't withstand
the Dragon Crest's power.

00:19:27.234 --> 00:19:28.837
They turned to dust.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:30.206
N-No...

00:19:30.239 --> 00:19:31.509
Please, mister!

00:19:31.543 --> 00:19:34.447
I need a weapon greater
than the Demon Dragon Blade.

00:19:34.481 --> 00:19:38.724
Otherwise, we'll never be able
to defeat the Dark Lord Hadlar!

00:19:38.757 --> 00:19:41.195
The Demon Dragon Blade?!

00:19:41.228 --> 00:19:42.898
Lon: You fought
against that weapon?!

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:45.269
Go on! How did
the battle end?!

00:19:45.302 --> 00:19:47.106
It was... a draw.

00:19:47.139 --> 00:19:49.143
I managed to break the blade,

00:19:49.177 --> 00:19:52.116
but mine completely
disintegrated.

00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:53.687
So I guess I lost.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.888
You broke...

00:19:54.922 --> 00:19:57.862
You broke the Demon Dragon
Blade with a weapon I crafted?!

00:19:57.895 --> 00:19:58.863
Dai: I did.

00:20:00.066 --> 00:20:01.502
[cackling]

00:20:01.535 --> 00:20:04.007
Wonderful! That's magnificent!

00:20:04.041 --> 00:20:06.111
Hey, Lon, what's so funny?

00:20:06.144 --> 00:20:08.015
How can I not be overjoyed?!

00:20:08.048 --> 00:20:10.052
Didn't you know
the Demon Dragon Blade

00:20:10.085 --> 00:20:12.924
was forged by the
gods themselves?

00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:14.561
That sword is
the exact weapon

00:20:14.595 --> 00:20:17.868
that I've spent over a century
of my life trying to replicate!

00:20:17.902 --> 00:20:19.638
To hear one of
my own creations

00:20:19.672 --> 00:20:23.513
that I forged out of an
inferior metal broke it?

00:20:23.546 --> 00:20:25.784
You have impressed me, boy!

00:20:25.817 --> 00:20:27.722
[delighted cackle]

00:20:27.755 --> 00:20:29.090
With you as its wielder,

00:20:29.123 --> 00:20:31.829
I can forge the
world's greatest sword.

00:20:31.863 --> 00:20:34.200
I will need to craft it
from the same material,

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:37.742
but I'm almost certain it will
end up being the winning blade.

00:20:37.775 --> 00:20:39.444
Okay, then. Let's start!

00:20:39.477 --> 00:20:43.351
Lon: Calm down. I said,
"the same material."

00:20:44.655 --> 00:20:47.628
Lon: The same as the
Demon Dragon Blade, Orichalcum.

00:20:47.661 --> 00:20:50.065
Find it and I can
make the sword.

00:20:50.099 --> 00:20:51.101
What?! I-

00:20:51.134 --> 00:20:53.471
I'm not an alchemist, you know.

00:20:53.506 --> 00:20:55.611
I still need
material to work with.

00:20:55.644 --> 00:20:58.315
Then we're all the way
back at square one. Fantastic.

00:20:58.349 --> 00:21:01.288
C'mon. All we need to do is
find some of this metal.

00:21:01.321 --> 00:21:04.060
Yeah, sure.
Easier said than...

00:21:04.093 --> 00:21:06.532
[realizing gasps]

00:21:06.566 --> 00:21:08.068
Both: The Crown
of Champions!

00:21:08.101 --> 00:21:11.709
King Romos said that it was
made of Orichalcum, didn't he?

00:21:11.743 --> 00:21:13.345
To Dermline Island!

00:21:17.521 --> 00:21:19.959
Dai: Grampa! Where?
Where is it?!

00:21:19.992 --> 00:21:21.228
What's going on, Dai?

00:21:21.261 --> 00:21:22.665
Dai: My Crown of Champions.

00:21:22.698 --> 00:21:25.770
Well, it should be
somewhere in that pile.

00:21:26.238 --> 00:21:27.206
Dai: Where?!

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.444
[frantic searching]

00:21:29.477 --> 00:21:31.314
Dai: Wait! I found it.

00:21:31.348 --> 00:21:33.018
You think that's
gonna be enough?

00:21:33.854 --> 00:21:35.356
Let's go.

00:21:35.389 --> 00:21:36.157
Dai: Bye, Grampa!

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:37.459
Popp: Excuse us.

00:21:38.061 --> 00:21:38.830
Popp: Zoom!

00:21:38.863 --> 00:21:41.969
Come clean up your mess!

00:23:37.534 --> 00:23:39.638
Narrator: While the
Underworld's greatest craftsman

00:23:39.672 --> 00:23:42.476
Lon Beruk forges
a sword for Dai,

00:23:42.511 --> 00:23:45.082
Princess Leona's world
summit gets underway,

00:23:45.115 --> 00:23:49.324
but the assembled leaders
struggle to see eye to eye.

00:23:49.357 --> 00:23:52.163
Before long, an
ominous fog sweeps in,

00:23:52.196 --> 00:23:55.837
and the thunderous footsteps
of the Dark Army follow...

00:23:55.871 --> 00:23:57.508
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:57.541 --> 00:24:00.379
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:00.412 --> 00:24:03.151
"The Landing of
Sovereign Rock Castle".
