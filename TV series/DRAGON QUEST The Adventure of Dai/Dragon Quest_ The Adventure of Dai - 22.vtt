WEBVTT

00:01:59.573 --> 00:02:00.942
Leona: What?

00:02:00.975 --> 00:02:03.748
You want to join
Dai's party?

00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:07.756
With this most recent battle's
failure, we both saw...

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.962
we realize we still
have much to learn.

00:02:10.996 --> 00:02:12.832
Yes, we wish to join them.

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:15.004
So that we can
hone our skills.

00:02:15.037 --> 00:02:17.207
Amy: Both of you - wait!

00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:19.914
I believe that I should
go with Dai and his friends!

00:02:19.947 --> 00:02:21.818
Amy - you wanna go, too?

00:02:21.851 --> 00:02:24.088
No, I will not allow it.

00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:25.223
I will join them.

00:02:25.257 --> 00:02:26.459
It just makes sense!

00:02:26.492 --> 00:02:28.664
Amy: Hey!
That's not fair, Apollo.

00:02:28.698 --> 00:02:29.332
Marin: She's right!

00:02:29.365 --> 00:02:30.768
Apollo: How is it not fair?

00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:32.104
Amy: What gives you the right?

00:02:32.137 --> 00:02:33.674
Apollo: In these matters...

00:02:33.707 --> 00:02:35.343
What a handful.

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.083
Just stop it, alright?

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:39.485
All three of you!

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.359
You have a responsibility to
protect Papnica Kingdom!

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:47.301
Besides, you won't need to.

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:49.673
I'm the one... joining Dai.

00:02:49.706 --> 00:02:51.008
All: What?!

00:02:51.041 --> 00:02:52.044
What was that?

00:02:52.077 --> 00:02:53.213
Did you just say?

00:02:53.246 --> 00:02:55.785
Huh? Oh, uh, nothing.

00:02:55.818 --> 00:02:58.624
[awkward laughing]

00:02:58.658 --> 00:03:00.194
Leona, can we talk?

00:03:00.227 --> 00:03:01.630
It won't take very long.

00:03:02.164 --> 00:03:04.201
What is it, Dai?

00:03:05.972 --> 00:03:07.676
Leona: A new weapon?

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.684
Dai: This Steel Broadsword
is on its last legs.

00:03:11.717 --> 00:03:14.455
Leona: Then we're off
to Bengarna Kingdom.

00:03:14.488 --> 00:03:17.294
They have the best
department store out there.

00:03:17.327 --> 00:03:18.864
What's that?

00:03:18.897 --> 00:03:22.204
You don't know?
It's a gigantic building...

00:03:22.238 --> 00:03:24.843
that's filled with every
store you can imagine!

00:03:24.877 --> 00:03:26.981
As big as... an inn?

00:03:27.014 --> 00:03:29.586
Don't be silly.
As big as... a castle!

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:30.855
Whoa!

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:34.462
My father took me there one time
when I was just a little girl.

00:03:34.495 --> 00:03:37.869
It was bigger than any
store I'd ever seen,

00:03:37.902 --> 00:03:40.073
and they had everything!

00:03:40.106 --> 00:03:41.843
Dai: Sounds great!

00:03:42.812 --> 00:03:45.618
So, uh... You wanna go?

00:03:45.651 --> 00:03:47.420
Mhmm! Yeah!

00:03:48.624 --> 00:03:51.362
[chuckling]

00:03:51.396 --> 00:03:53.701
Now you're talking!

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:57.474
Popp: Hmm. I think
it was like this.

00:04:00.013 --> 00:04:01.616
Matoriv [thought]:
Th... This is...

00:04:07.127 --> 00:04:08.362
Popp: Mentor?

00:04:12.606 --> 00:04:16.680
Matoriv [thought]: There's no
mistake. It's the Dragon Crest.

00:04:16.713 --> 00:04:20.253
But if he really
is a Dragon Knight...

00:04:20.287 --> 00:04:24.796
Avan... your student is
far more than you knew!

00:04:25.197 --> 00:04:26.365
Mentor;

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:29.304
you know something about
Dai's mark, don't you?

00:04:32.211 --> 00:04:33.446
Matoriv: My mistake.

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.052
You mentioned... you'll be
leaving soon with Dai?

00:04:36.085 --> 00:04:39.091
Uh, yeah. Is... that alright?

00:04:39.124 --> 00:04:41.362
I guess I'm still in training.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.419
[coughing]

00:04:58.096 --> 00:05:01.269
Go on, then.
Consider these a gift.

00:05:01.302 --> 00:05:03.206
Namely, the Sorcerer Cape and

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.145
the Shining Staff that
I used in my journeys...

00:05:06.178 --> 00:05:08.015
when I was young.

00:05:08.851 --> 00:05:10.019
And this.

00:05:14.361 --> 00:05:16.933
You have to be there.
For your friend.

00:05:17.835 --> 00:05:20.541
You'll see. Before long,
it'll happen.

00:05:20.574 --> 00:05:22.477
He's going to hit
a major wall.

00:05:22.512 --> 00:05:25.851
Not as a Hero,
but as a person.

00:05:25.885 --> 00:05:30.194
When that time comes,
you have to support him.

00:05:30.227 --> 00:05:31.697
Understood?

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:32.632
I-

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:33.767
Sure.

00:05:34.836 --> 00:05:38.043
Gotta say, he was awfully
nice today. Wasn't he?

00:05:38.076 --> 00:05:39.212
[excited chuckle]

00:05:39.245 --> 00:05:41.182
These seem pretty cool.

00:05:41.215 --> 00:05:43.486
But, uh... Well, ah...

00:05:44.288 --> 00:05:45.991
This thing's kind of ugly.

00:05:47.194 --> 00:05:48.497
Guard: Emergency!

00:05:48.531 --> 00:05:50.267
The balloon on the roof-

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.402
What the-!?

00:05:51.435 --> 00:05:52.872
Baduck: Oh no!

00:05:58.784 --> 00:05:59.418
Princess?!

00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:00.788
And Dai, too?

00:06:00.821 --> 00:06:01.790
A Snooze Spell!

00:06:01.824 --> 00:06:03.694
They've all been put
into a deep sleep!

00:06:03.727 --> 00:06:06.098
Baduck: Princess! Come back!

00:06:06.131 --> 00:06:07.702
Sorry, everyone!

00:06:07.736 --> 00:06:10.774
And don't worry, we're
going to be right back!

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.181
She always does this...

00:06:14.215 --> 00:06:16.252
I turn my back
for a moment...

00:06:16.286 --> 00:06:17.655
And she sneaks away.

00:06:17.688 --> 00:06:19.491
I suppose, that could mean...

00:06:19.526 --> 00:06:22.566
a small amount of peace
has returned to Papnica.

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:24.535
And anyway, Dai's with her.

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:26.940
They should be fine,
for a few days.

00:06:26.973 --> 00:06:29.979
Marin: Honestly? After
telling us we can't go...

00:06:30.881 --> 00:06:32.017
Leona... you sure?

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.455
I mean... Isn't this
sort of like stealing?

00:06:34.488 --> 00:06:35.724
It's not stealing!

00:06:35.758 --> 00:06:38.096
This thing belongs
to the royal family.

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:39.532
So it's mine for the taking!

00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:41.001
I guess so...

00:06:41.837 --> 00:06:43.005
Hey, that's right.

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:46.145
Shouldn't we have really
invited Popp along, with us?

00:06:46.179 --> 00:06:47.581
Uh, Popp?

00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:49.786
Oh, right, that Mage
friend of yours.

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:53.627
But, I don't know...
He seems a little flakey.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.867
He's the kind of guy that
needs a bit more experience.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.939
The kind where you really
have to put the work in.

00:06:59.973 --> 00:07:01.743
Popp [thought]:
Why, that little...

00:07:01.776 --> 00:07:05.016
Dai: He's a lot more
reliable than he looks.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.018
Oh?

00:07:06.052 --> 00:07:08.189
Leona: Really? He strikes
me as the type who

00:07:08.222 --> 00:07:11.095
runs away at even the
slightest whiff of danger.

00:07:11.128 --> 00:07:11.797
[fuming]

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.235
Ya think?! And who asked you?

00:07:14.268 --> 00:07:15.470
Leona: Oh, you're here.

00:07:15.504 --> 00:07:17.742
It's not like I was
hoping to enjoy a nice,

00:07:17.776 --> 00:07:20.347
little adventure with
Dai alone, or anything.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.184
[fuming]

00:07:22.217 --> 00:07:24.021
[awkward chuckle]

00:07:26.793 --> 00:07:27.829
Bengarna...

00:07:27.862 --> 00:07:30.834
It's considered the safest
country in the world.

00:07:30.868 --> 00:07:33.472
Thanks to its superior
military and industry,

00:07:33.507 --> 00:07:35.010
it's kept the
Dark Army at bay

00:07:35.043 --> 00:07:38.482
with an abundance of
resources and weapons,

00:07:38.517 --> 00:07:41.623
all backed by the world's
greatest economy.

00:07:42.391 --> 00:07:43.960
Let's go!

00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:46.833
[excited laughter]

00:07:49.104 --> 00:07:51.442
Leona: Go! Go!

00:07:51.475 --> 00:07:54.549
Hey! Will you slow down
a little? Seriously!

00:07:54.583 --> 00:07:57.021
What's the problem?
This is nothing!

00:07:57.054 --> 00:07:59.024
What's gotten into her?!

00:07:59.826 --> 00:08:00.628
[laughing]

00:08:00.661 --> 00:08:02.598
It's... not a big deal.

00:08:02.632 --> 00:08:05.637
I'm... actually a
little bit relieved.

00:08:07.007 --> 00:08:07.708
What?!

00:08:07.742 --> 00:08:09.813
When she's back
home in Papnica,

00:08:09.846 --> 00:08:13.319
Leona has to be a strong
leader for everyone.

00:08:13.352 --> 00:08:15.189
So she seemed a
little distant...

00:08:15.223 --> 00:08:19.264
But now she's way more
lively and like herself.

00:08:20.568 --> 00:08:21.804
So, what?

00:08:21.837 --> 00:08:24.475
Are we just here
as her stress relief?

00:08:24.509 --> 00:08:26.111
I mean, come on!

00:08:28.249 --> 00:08:29.451
Popp: There's a castle!

00:08:29.485 --> 00:08:32.792
Nuh-uh. That's not
a castle. Trust me.

00:08:33.393 --> 00:08:34.562
Go!

00:08:35.865 --> 00:08:38.837
Dai: Okay, Leona-
this is too fast!

00:08:43.413 --> 00:08:45.585
Popp: So this is
a department store?

00:08:45.618 --> 00:08:48.857
It's so huge! Is it
really all full of shops?

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.295
Leona: You bet. I'll show you!

00:08:53.567 --> 00:08:54.703
This is amazing.

00:08:54.736 --> 00:08:57.207
It's way bigger than
your usual weapon store.

00:08:58.342 --> 00:09:00.213
Leona: You can't
come here without

00:09:00.247 --> 00:09:02.150
checking out the basement!

00:09:02.183 --> 00:09:03.620
Both: Wait up!

00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:10.166
What is this room?
There's nothing in here!

00:09:13.273 --> 00:09:14.976
Oh, no - we're trapped!

00:09:15.578 --> 00:09:17.114
Popp: The room is falling!

00:09:17.147 --> 00:09:18.717
-[panicked cries]
-Leona: Calm down.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:23.259
It's called an elevator,
and it takes you to each floor.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.144
There's all kinds of
herbs and seeds...

00:09:32.177 --> 00:09:34.381
Unlike any I've seen!

00:09:34.414 --> 00:09:37.656
Leona: Two Slime Buns and
one Slime Tapioca please.

00:09:37.689 --> 00:09:40.994
Sure thing. That'll
be... ten gold even.

00:09:42.364 --> 00:09:43.332
Leona: Here.

00:09:43.365 --> 00:09:45.971
Are Slimes really safe to eat?

00:09:46.706 --> 00:09:48.142
It's not a real one, silly.

00:09:48.175 --> 00:09:51.114
It's just a snack that's
shaped like a Slime.

00:09:55.991 --> 00:09:58.830
Huh? There's something
inside this thing...

00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:01.803
Congratulations!

00:10:01.836 --> 00:10:05.042
You just found a... Mini Medal!

00:10:07.748 --> 00:10:10.687
What does this
thing actually... do?

00:10:12.858 --> 00:10:16.432
It's super
high-quality Horse Manure!

00:10:16.465 --> 00:10:19.070
It's so bright, I can't see!

00:10:20.173 --> 00:10:21.408
Such luxury!

00:10:21.442 --> 00:10:24.448
It really does make the
department store experience.

00:10:24.481 --> 00:10:26.854
Young man? Young man!

00:10:26.887 --> 00:10:28.356
Huh? Me?

00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:30.527
That's a nice buckle there.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.603
Seriously? I mean,
isn't it ugly?

00:10:34.636 --> 00:10:36.974
See? Look at that face.

00:10:37.007 --> 00:10:39.545
No, it's a wonderful buckle.

00:10:39.579 --> 00:10:42.652
I'll pay you five
hundred gold for it.

00:10:42.685 --> 00:10:45.223
Five hundred gold?
Are you serious?!

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.030
Man: Having a little trouble?

00:10:55.511 --> 00:10:57.715
It won't come off.

00:10:57.748 --> 00:11:00.052
Man: Then it's
definitely cursed.

00:11:15.718 --> 00:11:18.222
Salesman: Sirs!
See my latest product!

00:11:18.255 --> 00:11:22.063
Both attack and defense in
this all-purpose helmet!

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:28.176
I call it...
The Blockhead Basher.

00:11:28.209 --> 00:11:29.679
You know you want one!

00:11:29.712 --> 00:11:30.915
No way.

00:11:30.948 --> 00:11:31.749
Nuh-uh..

00:11:32.885 --> 00:11:36.492
Buy now, and I'll even...
throw in another for free!

00:11:36.526 --> 00:11:37.695
'Kay. Let's go.

00:11:37.728 --> 00:11:38.863
Right.

00:11:39.566 --> 00:11:41.936
Why... don't these sell?

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:45.009
Dai: Wow. This is so cool!

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.015
Dai: Wow!

00:11:49.719 --> 00:11:50.954
Dai: Awesome!

00:11:53.527 --> 00:11:54.863
Dai: Whoa!

00:11:54.896 --> 00:11:57.000
Thirty-eight hundred gold?!

00:11:57.034 --> 00:11:59.839
I guess I shouldn't
have touched it.

00:11:59.872 --> 00:12:01.375
Oh, hey, Dai?

00:12:01.408 --> 00:12:04.414
Feel free to buy anything
under five thousand gold.

00:12:05.885 --> 00:12:07.888
Metals and textiles
from Papnica.

00:12:07.922 --> 00:12:09.892
They always sell
for quite a lot.

00:12:09.926 --> 00:12:12.164
So... If I sell
these dresses...

00:12:12.197 --> 00:12:14.502
We'll get twenty to
thirty thousand gold.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:17.741
She's a real princess, huh?

00:12:18.442 --> 00:12:19.378
"CHANGING ROOMS"

00:12:19.411 --> 00:12:20.447
"CHANGING ROOMS"
Leona: Hey. How about this?

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.018
Leona: Hey. How about this?

00:12:27.294 --> 00:12:29.632
Are you kidding?
What kind of Sage...

00:12:29.665 --> 00:12:31.168
dresses like that?

00:12:32.672 --> 00:12:34.107
How about...

00:12:41.723 --> 00:12:43.259
Meow!

00:12:43.293 --> 00:12:46.265
Hey! Quit messing
around, would you?!

00:12:46.299 --> 00:12:50.406
Come on. This actually
has pretty high defense.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.344
So, Popp. What about you?

00:12:52.377 --> 00:12:53.713
Popp: I'm good.

00:12:53.747 --> 00:12:56.653
I got a new weapon
and a cape already.

00:12:56.687 --> 00:12:58.055
You pick something.

00:12:58.088 --> 00:13:00.861
In that case...
Right there!

00:13:08.677 --> 00:13:10.379
Okay! This will have to do.

00:13:14.388 --> 00:13:16.191
[cackling]

00:13:16.225 --> 00:13:18.930
Uh, do they have one...
a little more your size?

00:13:18.963 --> 00:13:22.639
It's fine.
I'll... get used to it!

00:13:22.672 --> 00:13:26.078
Leona: Okay, let's
find Dai a new weapon.

00:13:31.288 --> 00:13:33.593
[wobbling cries]

00:13:33.626 --> 00:13:37.133
[falling grunts]

00:13:38.369 --> 00:13:42.410
You know, I don't
feel very protected...

00:13:42.443 --> 00:13:43.880
[dismayed chirps]

00:13:45.483 --> 00:13:47.120
Leona: Oh, what's that?

00:13:49.324 --> 00:13:50.628
A Dragonsbane!

00:13:50.661 --> 00:13:52.598
Huh? The famous weapon?

00:13:53.332 --> 00:13:54.067
Leona: Yes.

00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:56.071
It can pierce
a dragon's hide,

00:13:56.104 --> 00:13:58.042
which is said to
be harder than steel.

00:13:58.076 --> 00:14:00.379
It's a top-quality blade.

00:14:00.413 --> 00:14:03.152
But expensive, right? Huh?

00:14:03.987 --> 00:14:06.358
Hang on.
There's no price on it.

00:14:06.391 --> 00:14:09.632
My friends, since this is
our only piece of its kind,

00:14:09.666 --> 00:14:11.468
it will be put on auction.

00:14:12.505 --> 00:14:14.240
An auction.

00:14:14.274 --> 00:14:15.409
Get real.

00:14:15.442 --> 00:14:19.018
These things always go for
over fifteen thousand gold.

00:14:19.051 --> 00:14:20.521
What'll you buy it with?

00:14:20.554 --> 00:14:21.589
Mommy's allowance?

00:14:21.623 --> 00:14:22.758
[chucking]

00:14:22.792 --> 00:14:24.127
Come here, you two!

00:14:25.597 --> 00:14:28.971
Leona: Dai, Popp;
let's buy that Dragonsbane!

00:14:29.004 --> 00:14:31.075
Are you serious?!

00:14:31.108 --> 00:14:33.680
I have sixteen thousand
gold right here.

00:14:33.713 --> 00:14:35.149
Don't even bother!

00:14:39.759 --> 00:14:42.532
Using weapons more
powerful than you are?

00:14:42.565 --> 00:14:43.399
Don't waste your money

00:14:43.432 --> 00:14:46.138
like one of those
ridiculous fools.

00:14:46.171 --> 00:14:49.177
They're not really strong.
They're just pretending.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:51.516
Are you...
You talking about us?

00:14:52.117 --> 00:14:54.556
Who else is there, chump?

00:14:54.589 --> 00:14:55.791
Both: Why, you...

00:14:55.824 --> 00:14:57.460
Grandmother. That's enough.

00:14:59.666 --> 00:15:01.536
Please, forgive us.

00:15:01.569 --> 00:15:03.907
Grandmother has no manners.

00:15:04.976 --> 00:15:07.346
Nabara: I just call
them as I see them.

00:15:12.992 --> 00:15:14.762
So who were they?

00:15:14.795 --> 00:15:16.667
They looked kinda like Seers.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:17.868
Yeah.

00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:20.440
And the younger one
was a cutie-patootie,

00:15:20.473 --> 00:15:21.710
wouldn't you say?

00:15:21.743 --> 00:15:23.947
Leona: No, I wouldn't.

00:15:25.116 --> 00:15:27.054
This country's finished.

00:15:27.087 --> 00:15:30.326
All that's advanced
is it's appearance.

00:15:30.994 --> 00:15:32.932
What is it, Merle?

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:36.205
Merle: Grandmother,
something's coming.

00:15:36.238 --> 00:15:38.810
Several beings with
terrifying power...

00:15:38.844 --> 00:15:39.979
Monsters!

00:15:40.012 --> 00:15:42.818
What was that? I haven't
sensed anything yet.

00:15:42.851 --> 00:15:45.256
My, Merle, you're
truly developing

00:15:45.289 --> 00:15:48.295
a sensitivity to the
abilities of our bloodline!

00:15:48.329 --> 00:15:51.434
They're close.
I can feel it!

00:15:58.583 --> 00:15:59.752
What is that?!

00:16:09.437 --> 00:16:10.407
[frightened yells]

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.543
A Hydra!

00:16:11.576 --> 00:16:14.715
F-Fire! Fire!

00:16:33.787 --> 00:16:35.323
Our cannons aren't working!

00:16:35.356 --> 00:16:37.694
Just how tough is its hide?

00:16:42.003 --> 00:16:43.306
Mr. Gopple:
Seventeen thousand!

00:16:43.339 --> 00:16:45.243
Leona: Seventeen
thousand, five hundred!

00:16:45.276 --> 00:16:47.079
Mr. Gopple:
Eighteen thousand!

00:16:49.685 --> 00:16:53.159
Hey, I think that's enough
now, Princess. Come on.

00:16:53.192 --> 00:16:56.298
We're already two thousand
gold over our limit.

00:16:56.331 --> 00:16:59.505
If no one else bids...
that's it!

00:16:59.539 --> 00:17:01.008
[giggling]

00:17:01.041 --> 00:17:05.717
I've got this.
We're fine. Nineteen thou-

00:17:06.686 --> 00:17:07.754
And it's sold!

00:17:07.788 --> 00:17:11.094
Today's feature item,
the Dragonsbane, goes to...

00:17:11.128 --> 00:17:12.731
The merchant, Mr. Gopple,

00:17:12.764 --> 00:17:16.438
for the whopping price of
eighteen thousand gold!

00:17:16.973 --> 00:17:19.879
[cheering]

00:17:19.912 --> 00:17:20.914
[annoyed sigh]

00:17:20.947 --> 00:17:23.185
What are you doing, Gomechan?!

00:17:24.856 --> 00:17:26.859
Leona, it's no big deal!

00:17:26.893 --> 00:17:28.797
I'll just use
a normal weapon.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:30.499
I can still fight without it.

00:17:30.534 --> 00:17:32.470
Dai; That's not it.

00:17:32.504 --> 00:17:35.511
Watching those goons just
walk away with that sword...

00:17:35.544 --> 00:17:36.513
I can't stand it.

00:17:36.546 --> 00:17:40.052
It would be better put
to use in our hands!

00:17:40.085 --> 00:17:42.457
[worried cries]

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:43.225
W-What's this?

00:17:43.258 --> 00:17:44.528
Man: Look at that!

00:17:44.562 --> 00:17:48.503
It looks like...
An army of dragons?!

00:17:49.437 --> 00:17:51.776
Leona: I see one Hydra, and...

00:17:51.809 --> 00:17:55.984
One, two, three, four, five...

00:17:56.017 --> 00:17:57.020
Five dragons!

00:17:57.053 --> 00:17:58.356
That's not good.

00:17:58.389 --> 00:18:00.728
Do you think... that's the
Dark Army's Dragon Legion?

00:18:00.761 --> 00:18:02.129
Hey, Gopple!

00:18:02.163 --> 00:18:04.201
You bought the
Dragonsbane, right?

00:18:04.234 --> 00:18:06.238
Go use it to drive them off!

00:18:06.272 --> 00:18:08.075
Don't be ridiculous!

00:18:08.109 --> 00:18:11.247
I bought this thing to
make money, not to use!

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:12.884
Pathetic.

00:18:14.054 --> 00:18:17.460
But having said that,
with this many Dragons,

00:18:17.493 --> 00:18:19.933
we might be in a
little over our heads.

00:18:19.966 --> 00:18:20.801
Uh-huh.

00:18:20.834 --> 00:18:22.704
[trembling]

00:18:24.608 --> 00:18:27.848
Leona: I think...
We should fight!

00:18:29.418 --> 00:18:32.257
It's our duty. The timing
of this attack...

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:35.162
Those dragons could
have come here for us.

00:18:35.195 --> 00:18:38.570
Either way, we should try
to buy a little time,

00:18:38.603 --> 00:18:41.843
so that the people
of the city can escape!

00:18:41.876 --> 00:18:44.615
Popp [thought]: She wants
to protect the people.

00:18:45.116 --> 00:18:46.384
Okay!

00:18:49.123 --> 00:18:51.562
You've changed
my mind about you,

00:18:51.596 --> 00:18:53.332
Princess.

00:18:53.365 --> 00:18:55.737
It seems like
true leaders really do

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.275
prove themselves in
the heat of the moment.

00:18:59.477 --> 00:19:00.412
Is that so?

00:19:00.446 --> 00:19:02.851
My opinion of you
hasn't changed, yet.

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:04.823
Watch me.

00:19:04.856 --> 00:19:06.960
Dai, all the dragons...

00:19:06.993 --> 00:19:08.362
I can take care of them.

00:19:08.395 --> 00:19:10.499
You take care of the big guy.

00:19:11.134 --> 00:19:12.470
Right!

00:19:12.504 --> 00:19:15.844
And Princess, you evacuate
the people in this building.

00:19:16.646 --> 00:19:17.914
I got it!

00:19:21.488 --> 00:19:25.296
Everyone; we need to
get out of here, right now!

00:19:25.329 --> 00:19:27.634
Okay. Here I go!

00:19:28.135 --> 00:19:34.682
[struggling grunts]

00:19:34.715 --> 00:19:40.359
[falling yell]

00:19:42.263 --> 00:19:43.666
[concerned chirps]

00:19:49.979 --> 00:19:51.849
This isn't working!

00:19:57.795 --> 00:19:58.963
Dai: Let's go, Gomechan!

00:20:03.072 --> 00:20:06.345
Popp: [nervous yell]

00:20:06.378 --> 00:20:10.553
Maybe, five Dragons
is a... little much...

00:20:12.357 --> 00:20:14.595
Okay. In that case!

00:20:14.629 --> 00:20:17.902
Popp: Let me show you
how fast I've learned...

00:20:17.935 --> 00:20:19.872
to flee from my battles!

00:20:21.007 --> 00:20:22.210
Okay - follow me!

00:20:22.243 --> 00:20:23.411
[screaming]

00:20:31.128 --> 00:20:33.132
Leona: Hurry! Hurry and run!

00:20:33.165 --> 00:20:35.804
[fleeing cries]

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.577
Girl: [terrified scream]

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:40.179
Mommy!

00:20:40.212 --> 00:20:42.283
Mommy? Mommy!

00:20:45.189 --> 00:20:48.328
Wait, Merle!
Where are you going?

00:20:49.631 --> 00:20:52.103
Merle: I have to
help those people.

00:20:52.136 --> 00:20:53.439
Don't be a fool!

00:20:53.472 --> 00:20:56.378
What on earth can
simple Seers like us do?

00:20:56.411 --> 00:20:58.082
We have to run.

00:20:58.115 --> 00:21:01.255
Merle: Seers... That's right.

00:21:01.288 --> 00:21:03.258
We knew when to run because

00:21:03.291 --> 00:21:05.964
we could foresee that
the Dark Army was coming.

00:21:05.998 --> 00:21:09.303
We've survived by
moving from town to town.

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:14.948
But... I've had enough!

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.357
I'm tired of running away,

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:21.996
knowing that so many of
these people will be hurt

00:21:22.029 --> 00:21:23.600
or even killed!

00:21:23.633 --> 00:21:26.304
Nabara: Merle, wait! Merle!

00:21:26.939 --> 00:21:28.408
Foolish child.

00:21:28.441 --> 00:21:30.480
Mommy! Mommy!

00:21:30.514 --> 00:21:32.349
Please, help my mommy!

00:21:32.383 --> 00:21:33.953
We need to move this rock.

00:21:46.077 --> 00:21:47.647
Dai: Wave Slash!

00:23:37.768 --> 00:23:41.542
Narrator: As the army of dragons
continues its siege on Bengarna,

00:23:41.575 --> 00:23:44.380
Dai unleashes
the power of his mark

00:23:44.413 --> 00:23:47.219
to pierce their hides of steel.

00:23:47.253 --> 00:23:50.727
While the Seers Nabara and
Merle watch the battle unfold,

00:23:50.761 --> 00:23:53.833
they recognize the
mysterious crest...

00:23:53.867 --> 00:23:57.207
But what could Nabara's
shocking revelation be?

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.676
Find out next time on

00:23:58.709 --> 00:24:02.083
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,
