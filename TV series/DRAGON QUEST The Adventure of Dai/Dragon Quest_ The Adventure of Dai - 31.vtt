WEBVTT

00:01:51.456 --> 00:01:53.360
Dai [thought]:
I won't give in.

00:01:53.393 --> 00:01:58.369
I'm me... I'm Dai, the Hero!

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.313
Even now, you would
resist your father?

00:02:03.347 --> 00:02:05.652
You ungrateful brat.

00:02:05.685 --> 00:02:06.920
Dai: You're not...

00:02:07.655 --> 00:02:09.324
You are not...

00:02:09.894 --> 00:02:12.665
You are not my dad!

00:02:16.106 --> 00:02:19.746
[roaring]

00:02:21.684 --> 00:02:22.786
Baran [thought]: What?

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.560
He struck me while I was
shielded by my Draconic Aura?!

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:32.337
Is that...

00:02:36.747 --> 00:02:39.553
Hyunckel: Dai's
crest is on his fist?

00:02:39.586 --> 00:02:43.961
Baran [thought]: How...
Impossible. This can't be!

00:02:43.995 --> 00:02:46.633
Throughout thousands of years
of Dragon Knight history,

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:48.504
for the light of
the crest to appear

00:02:48.538 --> 00:02:50.407
anywhere other than
the forehead...

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.279
It's never happened before.

00:02:55.718 --> 00:02:57.287
Could it be...

00:02:57.822 --> 00:02:59.894
The human spirit?

00:02:59.927 --> 00:03:02.532
Is this Soala's will?!

00:03:10.915 --> 00:03:11.950
Leona: Dai...

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:14.790
What... What's happening?

00:03:14.823 --> 00:03:18.731
Why did the Dragon Crest
appear on the boy's fist?!

00:03:18.764 --> 00:03:19.867
It looks like...

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.905
he's figured out how to channel
the energy of the crest.

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:24.075
He what?!

00:03:24.108 --> 00:03:27.381
To break Baran's
mind control spell...

00:03:27.414 --> 00:03:31.089
And gain the strength
necessary to damage him...

00:03:31.122 --> 00:03:33.125
He realized that
the power of the crest

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:36.465
needed to be
redirected to his fist.

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:39.606
While Dai's aura may
be weaker overall,

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.011
when it's focused
to a single point,

00:03:42.044 --> 00:03:44.516
each attack
will be stronger!

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.559
How is this
miracle possible?

00:03:49.592 --> 00:03:52.832
Hyunckel: I doubt a normal
Dragon Knight can do it.

00:03:53.768 --> 00:03:56.540
It seems even Baran
is taken aback.

00:03:56.573 --> 00:03:59.478
Dai: Prepare yourself, Baran!

00:04:02.417 --> 00:04:05.490
You've taken so much from me.

00:04:05.525 --> 00:04:09.599
My... My dearest friends.

00:04:09.633 --> 00:04:14.475
Even if you are my dad,
I'll never forgive you!

00:04:16.412 --> 00:04:18.316
You're gonna pay!

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:34.749
Watch your tongue, boy!

00:04:45.103 --> 00:04:47.007
[roaring]

00:04:54.355 --> 00:04:56.492
[roaring]

00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:02.539
Amazing!

00:05:02.572 --> 00:05:04.676
I don't know for sure, but...

00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:08.049
I think it was the
human half of Dai's bloodline

00:05:08.082 --> 00:05:10.821
that brought us this miracle.

00:05:10.855 --> 00:05:14.428
His feelings for his friend
ignited a fire in his heart,

00:05:14.461 --> 00:05:18.303
driving the Dragon and Darklings
power into his fist...

00:05:18.336 --> 00:05:21.610
Allowing Dai to...
control them both!

00:05:26.285 --> 00:05:28.858
Crocodine: You mean
right now, Dai is...

00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:30.494
Hyunckel: He should
have complete control

00:05:30.528 --> 00:05:33.132
over the power of
the Dragon Crest.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.082
Baran [thought]: Soala...

00:05:41.115 --> 00:05:42.552
Even you...

00:05:42.585 --> 00:05:45.958
Are you really saying that
I was wrong all this time?

00:05:47.428 --> 00:05:48.897
Curse you!

00:05:55.811 --> 00:05:58.082
Draconic Aura!

00:06:26.205 --> 00:06:27.942
But how?

00:06:27.975 --> 00:06:28.911
You're right!

00:06:28.944 --> 00:06:29.880
All of his attacks...

00:06:29.913 --> 00:06:32.050
are stronger than
they've ever been!

00:06:32.083 --> 00:06:33.419
It's incredible!

00:06:34.522 --> 00:06:36.492
But still...

00:06:47.181 --> 00:06:48.551
Baran: This is ridiculous!

00:06:48.584 --> 00:06:51.088
A child can't best his father.

00:06:52.157 --> 00:06:53.961
It's time to back down,

00:06:53.994 --> 00:06:56.967
or I'm going to put
a hole through you.

00:06:57.001 --> 00:07:00.240
If I fire my Crest
Beam at full power,

00:07:00.273 --> 00:07:02.878
it can carve
through mountains.

00:07:03.514 --> 00:07:05.618
Dai: So what if it can?

00:07:05.651 --> 00:07:08.222
Baran: Don't test me, Dino.

00:07:09.491 --> 00:07:11.262
Dai: My name...

00:07:11.295 --> 00:07:13.132
My name is Dai.

00:07:17.141 --> 00:07:19.579
Take this!

00:07:33.473 --> 00:07:36.179
Your Grace - what was that?!

00:07:36.212 --> 00:07:38.684
It's the Dragon Knights.

00:07:41.321 --> 00:07:42.925
Don't hold back.

00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:46.299
Excuse me?

00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:48.570
The others are fair game...

00:07:49.872 --> 00:07:51.576
But I'm not?!

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.085
Foolish child...

00:07:56.118 --> 00:07:59.191
[powerful yell]

00:07:59.225 --> 00:08:03.667
Hyunckel [thought]: Slow down.
Don't anger Baran any further.

00:08:03.701 --> 00:08:06.973
His full power has
yet to be revealed!

00:08:08.276 --> 00:08:09.780
Leona: Amazing, Dai...

00:08:09.813 --> 00:08:12.250
We might even have a chance.

00:08:13.553 --> 00:08:14.756
Leona: Merle!

00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.564
Princess Leona!
I'll cast a Heal.

00:08:18.597 --> 00:08:21.603
Forget about me.
See to the others first.

00:08:21.637 --> 00:08:24.041
Merle: Okay. But... Um...

00:08:24.643 --> 00:08:26.846
Leona: Leave Popp to me.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.016
Huh?

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:30.420
Leona: I've never
actually used it before,

00:08:30.453 --> 00:08:33.527
but there's a certain
spell I want to try.

00:08:45.818 --> 00:08:49.391
It begins. The greatest
battle in the world...

00:08:49.425 --> 00:08:52.163
Beyond anything
we can fathom!

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:09.832
[powerful yells]

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.282
They're gone!

00:09:18.315 --> 00:09:19.719
Look - there!

00:10:13.259 --> 00:10:14.361
He did it!

00:10:14.394 --> 00:10:15.964
No - look out!

00:10:15.998 --> 00:10:17.400
It's over.

00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:27.086
Now die!

00:10:47.394 --> 00:10:48.429
Your Grace!

00:10:48.463 --> 00:10:49.733
King of Teran: Incredible.

00:10:49.766 --> 00:10:53.206
The legends do no justice
to their ferocity...

00:10:53.239 --> 00:10:55.009
Are we gonna be okay?

00:10:55.042 --> 00:10:57.447
King of Teran: We need
to make a decision.

00:10:59.184 --> 00:11:03.025
We need to decide which of
the Dragon Knights is right.

00:11:16.252 --> 00:11:17.688
Leona: Dai!

00:11:17.722 --> 00:11:19.659
It's exactly as I feared.

00:11:19.692 --> 00:11:22.230
At this rate, Dai
doesn't stand a chance.

00:11:22.263 --> 00:11:23.466
What do you mean?

00:11:23.499 --> 00:11:27.642
Up until now Baran has been
holding back his full strength-

00:11:27.675 --> 00:11:29.445
to protect Dai.

00:11:29.478 --> 00:11:30.781
Hyunckel: Even with us,

00:11:30.814 --> 00:11:34.087
he probably held back
because we used to be allies.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.564
But now he's a Dragonoid,
a vicious Demon Beast.

00:11:38.597 --> 00:11:39.933
If he's provoked enough,

00:11:39.966 --> 00:11:43.105
he'll kill anyone,
no matter who they are!

00:11:44.241 --> 00:11:45.243
You mean...

00:11:45.277 --> 00:11:49.451
That's right. Even if
it means his own child.

00:11:57.167 --> 00:11:58.803
Burn away...

00:11:59.572 --> 00:12:02.310
Baran: Along with
this kingdom!

00:12:05.751 --> 00:12:06.619
Oh no...

00:12:06.653 --> 00:12:08.990
So, that's Doruora?

00:12:32.839 --> 00:12:34.609
His hands - look at them!

00:12:34.642 --> 00:12:36.880
They look like a dragon!

00:12:36.913 --> 00:12:38.583
So much energy...

00:12:38.617 --> 00:12:39.985
I get it!

00:12:40.019 --> 00:12:42.959
Doruora compresses massive
amounts of the Draconic Aura,

00:12:42.992 --> 00:12:45.129
and fires it as a spell!

00:12:46.298 --> 00:12:48.102
Perish!

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:51.509
Watch out. Dai, move it!

00:12:55.518 --> 00:12:56.919
Nice try.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.192
Doruora!

00:13:09.779 --> 00:13:11.314
[worried yell]

00:13:18.229 --> 00:13:21.134
So much power...
Destruction...

00:13:21.168 --> 00:13:24.007
This isn't even
a spell anymore!

00:13:24.608 --> 00:13:26.445
Where's Dai?!

00:13:26.478 --> 00:13:28.315
Did he get Baran?

00:13:48.222 --> 00:13:51.630
Baran: I see. You dodged
with a Zoom spell.

00:13:51.663 --> 00:13:53.533
You have good instincts.

00:13:53.566 --> 00:13:56.606
He managed to get away from
the Doruora's blast field

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.843
just in the nick of time.

00:14:00.748 --> 00:14:02.885
I will not miss again!

00:14:09.398 --> 00:14:11.235
Levizoom!

00:14:11.268 --> 00:14:14.709
But Dai, you can't
beat Baran in the air!

00:14:14.743 --> 00:14:17.246
He... He has wings!

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.426
Why... Why would
he take this risk?

00:14:23.459 --> 00:14:25.229
Hyunckel: Because of us.

00:14:25.262 --> 00:14:28.101
If Baran fires that
kind of spell down here,

00:14:28.135 --> 00:14:31.275
we'll be reduced
to nothing but ash.

00:14:31.308 --> 00:14:34.381
That's why Dai changed
the battlefield.

00:14:34.414 --> 00:14:35.350
B-But...

00:14:35.383 --> 00:14:38.089
'Cause in the depths
of his anger, it's him.

00:14:38.122 --> 00:14:40.694
That's still the
Dai we know up there.

00:14:40.727 --> 00:14:43.265
He's not a monster like Baran.

00:14:45.236 --> 00:14:46.639
Come on...

00:14:46.673 --> 00:14:48.944
Just hurry up and heal us!

00:14:48.977 --> 00:14:50.948
Crocodine: I can't
just do nothing.

00:14:50.981 --> 00:14:52.719
All I need is to stand!

00:14:52.752 --> 00:14:53.954
Okay!

00:14:53.987 --> 00:14:55.524
[chuckling]

00:14:55.557 --> 00:14:57.628
It seems like you've given up.

00:14:59.532 --> 00:15:01.636
Let's end this.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:08.348
[victorious cackle]

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:18.001
Baran: What do you
think you're doing?

00:15:19.872 --> 00:15:23.045
Dai: I'm not giving up.

00:15:23.079 --> 00:15:25.918
Dai: Because I know even
you can't cast a spell

00:15:25.951 --> 00:15:28.723
that strong more than twice!

00:15:28.756 --> 00:15:31.596
So, if I can take one more...

00:15:31.629 --> 00:15:33.298
Then I'll win!

00:15:33.967 --> 00:15:35.771
You think so?!

00:15:35.804 --> 00:15:37.575
You can't, Dai!

00:15:37.608 --> 00:15:39.078
Baran: You fool.

00:15:39.111 --> 00:15:40.246
No being can withstand

00:15:40.279 --> 00:15:44.120
a Dragon Knight's
Doruora at full power!

00:15:46.391 --> 00:15:50.099
Dai: It's never been used
on another Dragon Knight.

00:15:50.133 --> 00:15:53.472
But it's a risk...
I'm willing to take.

00:15:54.107 --> 00:15:56.980
Save your nonsense, boy.

00:15:57.013 --> 00:15:59.284
No, Dai. Dodge it!

00:15:59.317 --> 00:16:01.254
Baran: It's too late for that.

00:16:03.092 --> 00:16:04.696
Now, away with you...

00:16:04.729 --> 00:16:07.400
Doruora!

00:16:10.875 --> 00:16:13.981
Dragon within,
time to awaken.

00:16:14.014 --> 00:16:16.953
Focus everything
I have to defeat him.

00:16:16.986 --> 00:16:19.692
Draconic Aura!

00:16:37.159 --> 00:16:40.165
Dai?! Dai, no!

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:51.689
[victorious laughter]

00:16:51.723 --> 00:16:53.458
Now there's nothing left.

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:59.471
What is so funny?!

00:16:59.505 --> 00:17:00.707
You monster.

00:17:00.741 --> 00:17:03.513
[laughing]

00:17:14.301 --> 00:17:18.376
He blocked it-
the Ultimate Spell!

00:17:18.409 --> 00:17:19.812
Impossible!

00:17:19.845 --> 00:17:20.981
Dai: Baran...

00:17:21.014 --> 00:17:24.254
You've got nothing left now!

00:17:30.399 --> 00:17:31.702
Here goes...

00:17:35.309 --> 00:17:37.515
Avan...

00:17:37.548 --> 00:17:39.150
Strash!

00:17:50.841 --> 00:17:52.410
Dai: Leona's blade?!

00:17:56.886 --> 00:17:59.190
[cackling]

00:17:59.223 --> 00:18:00.861
Isn't it a pity.

00:18:00.895 --> 00:18:04.668
When a Dragon Knight fights with
Draconic Aura at full strength,

00:18:04.702 --> 00:18:08.710
normal weapons and armor can't
endure the power and burn up.

00:18:10.346 --> 00:18:14.755
In your case, you've focused all
your Aura into your right arm.

00:18:14.788 --> 00:18:19.397
No weapon in the world could
survive such an immense force!

00:18:20.834 --> 00:18:21.970
Oh, no!

00:18:22.003 --> 00:18:23.072
Baran: Except...

00:18:23.105 --> 00:18:24.808
This.

00:18:27.179 --> 00:18:29.752
This is my Demon Dragon Blade,

00:18:29.786 --> 00:18:34.528
and the only sword in the world
that can endure Draconic Aura!

00:18:35.864 --> 00:18:37.033
You're joking.

00:18:37.067 --> 00:18:40.105
So you see, only a blade
like this can withstand

00:18:40.139 --> 00:18:43.012
a Dragon Knight's
fully-powered swing.

00:18:43.045 --> 00:18:46.085
I may not have the
Magic Power for Doruora,

00:18:46.118 --> 00:18:48.256
but victory is in sight.

00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:50.927
Now see for yourself!

00:18:55.537 --> 00:18:56.238
Let go.

00:18:56.271 --> 00:18:57.874
I don't think so!

00:19:01.482 --> 00:19:04.288
I don't intend
to just lie around.

00:19:04.321 --> 00:19:07.326
I am the mighty Beast King!

00:19:14.876 --> 00:19:16.812
Hang in there, everyone.

00:19:19.952 --> 00:19:22.924
I'm going to bring Popp back.

00:19:25.496 --> 00:19:27.635
His heart... It's
not beating anymore.

00:19:27.668 --> 00:19:29.906
Leona [thought]: I don't
know if I can cast

00:19:29.939 --> 00:19:31.643
such a powerful spell.

00:19:31.676 --> 00:19:36.251
But if I don't succeed,
then Popp will...

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:41.495
Gods, bless us.

00:19:41.529 --> 00:19:42.597
In thy name,

00:19:42.631 --> 00:19:45.637
let the soul of this one
whose life has burned out...

00:19:45.671 --> 00:19:47.941
be hereby restored.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:58.495
I know that spell...

00:20:01.068 --> 00:20:02.236
Zing!

00:20:05.744 --> 00:20:06.779
Merle: It's Zing.

00:20:06.812 --> 00:20:10.086
The strongest resurrection
spell known to exist.

00:20:10.119 --> 00:20:12.256
Hyunckel: Does that
mean Popp can be saved?

00:20:12.757 --> 00:20:14.060
I don't know.

00:20:14.093 --> 00:20:15.730
The success rate
is fifty percent,

00:20:15.764 --> 00:20:19.470
even with the most experienced
Clerics in all of the kingdoms.

00:20:19.505 --> 00:20:21.942
So it's entirely
up to her skill.

00:20:22.978 --> 00:20:25.683
Come back to us.
Please, Popp!

00:20:30.995 --> 00:20:35.235
If you want to free yourself,
you'll have to use Gigabreak!

00:20:35.771 --> 00:20:36.906
Curse you!

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.351
[pained howl]

00:20:43.854 --> 00:20:44.822
A Zapple?

00:20:45.891 --> 00:20:47.359
Crocodine!

00:20:49.966 --> 00:20:54.341
Stay down. Down like the
wild beast that you are.

00:20:54.374 --> 00:20:56.278
Not even the gods themselves

00:20:56.312 --> 00:20:58.983
can interfere with
this final battle...

00:20:59.886 --> 00:21:02.557
Now, my son... get ready!

00:21:24.067 --> 00:21:25.703
[roaring]

00:21:27.273 --> 00:21:29.310
[pained groan]

00:21:35.489 --> 00:21:36.693
I'm not finished!

00:21:36.726 --> 00:21:41.502
We're out of time.
If I can move, it's enough.

00:21:41.536 --> 00:21:44.473
Hyunckel: Crocodine,
let's go. Now.

00:21:45.309 --> 00:21:46.613
Hyunckel.

00:21:46.646 --> 00:21:50.386
Dai needs help.
So lend me your strength.

00:21:50.419 --> 00:21:52.089
I have a plan.

00:21:52.123 --> 00:21:53.659
A... plan?

00:21:57.835 --> 00:22:00.005
[roaring]

00:23:37.701 --> 00:23:39.470
Narrator: Dai
is on the defensive,

00:23:39.505 --> 00:23:41.407
but thanks to some
help from Hyunckel,

00:23:41.441 --> 00:23:43.579
he just might
turn things around.

00:23:43.613 --> 00:23:45.550
Meanwhile, Leona
grows desperate

00:23:45.583 --> 00:23:49.023
when the Zing spell
fails to revive Popp.

00:23:49.057 --> 00:23:52.865
As the battle nears its climax,
lightning strikes family ties,

00:23:52.898 --> 00:23:56.305
but will Dai be able to
defeat Baran once and for all?

00:23:56.338 --> 00:23:57.541
Find out next time on

00:23:57.574 --> 00:24:00.212
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:00.246 --> 00:24:02.684
"Farewell to the Father".
