WEBVTT

00:01:50.454 --> 00:01:52.759
Albinass: Needle Thousand!

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:57.569
[pained cry]

00:01:57.602 --> 00:01:59.906
[pained grunts]

00:02:08.457 --> 00:02:09.893
[cackling]

00:02:09.927 --> 00:02:11.564
Foolish little girl.

00:02:11.597 --> 00:02:14.836
I have no intention
of sacrificing myself.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.406
And once you're
out of my way,

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.746
I plan to save
Lord Hadlar from his ruin.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.449
Save him?

00:02:21.483 --> 00:02:24.523
He won't last much longer at
the rate he's deteriorating.

00:02:24.556 --> 00:02:26.994
None of the Guards are
strong enough to stop it.

00:02:27.027 --> 00:02:30.166
But... The Dark
King's Magic Power

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.237
is stronger than
all of us combined.

00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:34.208
He may be able to
reverse the damage.

00:02:34.242 --> 00:02:35.678
I must win back his favor,

00:02:35.711 --> 00:02:39.218
so I'm going to defeat you
Disciples of Avan myself-

00:02:39.251 --> 00:02:41.289
as an offering to his throne.

00:02:41.322 --> 00:02:44.361
In exchange, perhaps
he will show Hadlar mercy.

00:02:44.394 --> 00:02:47.301
Is... Is that...
your plan, or his?

00:02:47.335 --> 00:02:48.971
Albinass: Oh, the
choice is all mine.

00:02:49.005 --> 00:02:50.340
As a matter of fact,

00:02:50.373 --> 00:02:53.246
I'm sure that Hadlar will
be furious when he realizes.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.152
Regardless, his survival
is far more important to me

00:02:56.185 --> 00:02:59.325
than his approval -
I have no greater wish.

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.931
Really? Albinass...

00:03:01.964 --> 00:03:03.200
Albinass: Kind, young Maam.

00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:04.636
Spare me your sympathy.

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:06.540
If you'd like to
make yourself of use,

00:03:06.573 --> 00:03:09.779
stop resisting and let me
finish this quickly...

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:12.919
Now... Needle Thousand!

00:03:30.855 --> 00:03:31.957
[amused chuckle]

00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:33.728
You're scurrying
like a rat...

00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:36.332
Amusing, but I can't
waste any more time

00:03:36.366 --> 00:03:37.835
on a pest like you.

00:03:38.737 --> 00:03:40.641
The queen is
the strongest piece,

00:03:40.674 --> 00:03:42.779
but she only moves
when it counts.

00:03:42.812 --> 00:03:43.614
Great.

00:03:44.348 --> 00:03:46.252
Hold still, and
I'll show you...

00:03:46.286 --> 00:03:49.826
the form I take when I
battle at full strength.

00:03:59.546 --> 00:04:01.716
Maam [thought]: Oh, no
- here we go!

00:04:06.258 --> 00:04:09.398
So, you've been hiding
your true form all along?

00:04:09.432 --> 00:04:11.102
Albinass: Like I said,
the queen is

00:04:11.136 --> 00:04:13.039
the most powerful
piece on the board.

00:04:13.073 --> 00:04:15.811
In order to keep that
kind of power under control,

00:04:15.845 --> 00:04:19.586
I try to keep my limbs
concealed during battle.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.857
But my patience
is wearing thin,

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.363
and now you have no
hope of defeating me.

00:04:30.307 --> 00:04:31.610
Maam [thought]:
She's so fast!

00:04:31.643 --> 00:04:34.649
[pained yell]

00:04:37.288 --> 00:04:39.826
Albinass: The best spell
in my arsenal is Kasizz.

00:04:39.859 --> 00:04:42.464
The way Needle Thousand
works is by breaking apart

00:04:42.498 --> 00:04:45.471
that spell and releasing
several smaller points.

00:04:45.505 --> 00:04:47.508
Are you following me?

00:04:47.542 --> 00:04:49.913
But when I use
my hands like this,

00:04:49.946 --> 00:04:53.320
I'm able to focus that
energy to a single blast.

00:04:53.353 --> 00:04:56.826
Albinass: I call this...
Legionsphere!

00:05:19.304 --> 00:05:20.708
[pained yell]

00:05:34.468 --> 00:05:35.738
[chuckling]

00:05:35.771 --> 00:05:39.746
Your feeble Midheal will
only delay the inevitable.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.919
Maam [thought]: She's
strong... She's too strong.

00:05:42.952 --> 00:05:43.988
With this much power,

00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:47.060
Albinass might really
defeat us all by herself.

00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:50.033
Unless...

00:05:50.834 --> 00:05:53.540
Please, Albinass.
Wait a minute.

00:05:53.574 --> 00:05:54.743
Albinass: What now?

00:05:54.776 --> 00:05:58.149
Listen, I still don't
want to fight you...

00:05:58.183 --> 00:05:59.719
There's another way.

00:05:59.752 --> 00:06:01.456
Well, if you're going to beg,

00:06:01.489 --> 00:06:04.596
the least you can do
is admit I've already won.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.400
That feeling driving you
to save Lord Hadlar...

00:06:07.434 --> 00:06:11.610
It's more than just loyalty,
isn't it? Admit that!

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:14.850
What you feel...

00:06:14.883 --> 00:06:17.187
It can only be one
thing, and it's...

00:06:17.221 --> 00:06:20.360
[cackling]

00:06:20.393 --> 00:06:22.832
Albinass: Are you about to
tell me that I love him?

00:06:22.865 --> 00:06:26.138
Oh, please. Spare me
your petty sentiment.

00:06:26.171 --> 00:06:29.680
There is no place in my
heart for such a feeling.

00:06:29.713 --> 00:06:32.718
Don't you see? I'm little
more than a soldier.

00:06:32.752 --> 00:06:34.856
A tool of war has no use-

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:37.327
for something as
preposterous as love.

00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:38.363
Not true!

00:06:38.396 --> 00:06:39.766
Silence!

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.872
I know you're only buying time
in order to heal yourself.

00:06:57.936 --> 00:06:58.838
Yes, that's better.

00:06:58.871 --> 00:07:01.475
Stay just like that
and close your eyes.

00:07:02.612 --> 00:07:04.281
Maam [thought]:
It's no use.

00:07:04.315 --> 00:07:05.450
There's nothing I can say

00:07:05.483 --> 00:07:08.456
that will convince
her to change her mind.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.326
If she can't accept
how she feels,

00:07:10.359 --> 00:07:13.232
then she's never
going to hear me.

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:17.207
What can I...
What can I do here?

00:07:19.278 --> 00:07:21.215
There you go.
Very good, Maam.

00:07:21.248 --> 00:07:23.386
Enjoy your trip to
the afterlife.

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:25.658
Legionsphere!

00:07:31.335 --> 00:07:34.776
Avan: Maam... Maam...

00:07:35.678 --> 00:07:37.515
But just know this;

00:07:37.548 --> 00:07:40.988
There are times when
love... and kindness...

00:07:41.021 --> 00:07:44.494
aren't enough to
protect people alone.

00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:47.635
Avan: Just as strength without
justice is tyranny,

00:07:47.668 --> 00:07:50.608
justice without
strength is powerless.

00:07:50.641 --> 00:07:52.645
Do you understand?

00:07:52.679 --> 00:07:54.081
Maam [thought]:
That's right.

00:07:54.115 --> 00:07:57.689
I can't let myself be
defeated out of love.

00:07:57.722 --> 00:08:00.594
The others and I
have all come too far

00:08:00.628 --> 00:08:02.732
- and it's not over yet...

00:08:05.237 --> 00:08:07.240
Because I still have this!

00:08:23.306 --> 00:08:24.642
Amdo!

00:08:34.862 --> 00:08:37.868
Albinass, I'll
never let you win.

00:08:39.605 --> 00:08:41.142
My friends are counting on me,

00:08:41.175 --> 00:08:43.613
and we've sworn to
protect each other...

00:08:45.818 --> 00:08:47.689
Just like the Royal Guard.

00:08:47.722 --> 00:08:49.893
Your weapon...
That's Lon Beruk's work!

00:08:49.926 --> 00:08:52.330
Right - The Dark Armor Fist.

00:08:52.363 --> 00:08:54.401
And just like
Hyunckel's spear.

00:08:54.434 --> 00:08:56.172
It's more than meets the eye.

00:08:56.205 --> 00:09:00.413
It makes me totally immune
to magic of every kind.

00:09:00.446 --> 00:09:04.656
Until now, I couldn't bring
myself to use it in battle...

00:09:04.689 --> 00:09:07.828
Because it's far too
powerful, even for you.

00:09:09.465 --> 00:09:10.701
But if...

00:09:10.734 --> 00:09:13.841
If all you are is a tool
of war, I won't hold back.

00:09:13.874 --> 00:09:18.850
I've tried my best to give you
a chance - now, I'll fight.

00:09:31.275 --> 00:09:32.010
[roaring]

00:09:32.044 --> 00:09:33.145
Take this!

00:09:36.351 --> 00:09:37.353
[charging yell]

00:09:39.224 --> 00:09:39.993
Maam [thought]: Not bad.

00:09:40.026 --> 00:09:41.696
I can already
see why Lon Beruk

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.536
told me to wear this on
my non-dominant hand.

00:09:44.569 --> 00:09:46.072
It makes the perfect shield,

00:09:46.105 --> 00:09:48.710
and it's definitely
enhancing my defenses...

00:09:48.744 --> 00:09:52.350
So, let's see what it
can do with my attacks.

00:09:52.384 --> 00:09:55.256
Even against Orichalcum,
if I move with enough speed,

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.294
I can do some real damage.

00:09:57.327 --> 00:09:59.632
Justice found its strength.

00:10:05.578 --> 00:10:07.047
What?!

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.750
I've got you now!

00:10:18.904 --> 00:10:20.808
Did you actually think
that your little toy

00:10:20.841 --> 00:10:23.279
would be enough to stop me?

00:10:28.322 --> 00:10:29.926
Why can't I land a hit?!

00:10:47.094 --> 00:10:49.030
Maam [thought]: I can't
keep up with her.

00:10:49.064 --> 00:10:51.235
She's going to
win with her speed.

00:10:51.268 --> 00:10:53.273
I need something big.

00:10:53.306 --> 00:10:55.645
But if Albinass is
made out of Orichalcum,

00:10:55.678 --> 00:10:57.715
my Refractor Fist
isn't going to work...

00:10:57.749 --> 00:11:00.386
I guess that means I'll
have to use the other skill

00:11:00.419 --> 00:11:01.857
that the Grand
Master taught me:

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.831
The Warrior-Master-Style...
Tiger Shatter Fist.

00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:08.303
Brokeena: However,
I must warn you.

00:11:08.336 --> 00:11:10.808
This attack is not
for the faint of heart.

00:11:10.842 --> 00:11:13.145
It's the most physically
devastating one I know.

00:11:13.179 --> 00:11:16.452
It allows you to concentrate
the full power of your Aura

00:11:16.485 --> 00:11:18.389
into one high-velocity blast.

00:11:18.423 --> 00:11:21.963
Of course, a powerful move is
not without its shortcomings.

00:11:21.997 --> 00:11:25.203
An enemy could deflect
the force right back at you,

00:11:25.236 --> 00:11:28.142
so you should only use it
if you're out of options.

00:11:30.914 --> 00:11:33.653
Maam [thought]: I don't see
any other choice, Master.

00:11:33.687 --> 00:11:35.925
I'll just have to hope
that my Dark Armor Fist

00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.162
is tough enough to protect me.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.408
Ah, so you've decided
to stop flailing around.

00:11:44.441 --> 00:11:47.046
I presume you have one
last trick up your sleeve?

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.251
Well, go ahead.
It's pointless.

00:11:49.284 --> 00:11:52.124
Maybe it is, but...
I still have to try!

00:11:52.157 --> 00:11:55.430
Even a fighter able to take
down a bear with one punch...

00:11:55.464 --> 00:11:59.606
can meet their demise if they're
faced with a swarm of hornets.

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:01.943
And you just kicked
the hornet's nest, Maam.

00:12:01.977 --> 00:12:02.778
Huh?

00:12:10.259 --> 00:12:12.263
Th-This... is...

00:12:22.184 --> 00:12:24.656
Maam [thought]:
It's... too much...

00:12:24.689 --> 00:12:26.225
Albinass: [victorious cackle]

00:12:26.259 --> 00:12:28.564
Are you beginning
to see what I mean?

00:12:28.597 --> 00:12:30.033
You'll never keep up with me,

00:12:30.066 --> 00:12:34.275
and I'm going to keep stinging
you, again and again...

00:12:34.308 --> 00:12:35.844
Until I have you so weak

00:12:35.878 --> 00:12:38.449
that you'll beg me
to put an end to it

00:12:39.786 --> 00:12:43.192
Fight all you want.
I've already won.

00:12:44.394 --> 00:12:47.066
[pained yell]

00:12:51.776 --> 00:12:53.112
[chuckling]

00:12:53.145 --> 00:12:55.718
Well, have you finally
run out strength?

00:12:55.751 --> 00:12:57.788
You've proven to
be quite troublesome.

00:12:57.821 --> 00:13:01.295
I'll give you credit for that.

00:13:01.328 --> 00:13:04.334
Maam [thought]: I've never
faced anybody this strong...

00:13:04.367 --> 00:13:05.671
But, why now?

00:13:05.704 --> 00:13:08.409
If Albinass always had
this sort of power,

00:13:08.442 --> 00:13:10.213
why didn't she use it earlier?

00:13:10.246 --> 00:13:13.520
She could've won any of our
other battles with this attack,

00:13:13.553 --> 00:13:15.591
so... why would
she hold it back?

00:13:15.624 --> 00:13:17.628
The queen is
the strongest piece,

00:13:17.661 --> 00:13:19.899
but she only moves
when it counts.

00:13:19.932 --> 00:13:21.669
Maam [thought]:
The queen certainly is

00:13:21.703 --> 00:13:23.741
the strongest piece.

00:13:23.774 --> 00:13:26.011
But maybe her ability
to move so quickly

00:13:26.045 --> 00:13:29.218
can also be her weakness.

00:13:29.251 --> 00:13:32.958
That's it! It's the
only option I have left.

00:13:36.398 --> 00:13:37.367
[evil laughter]

00:13:37.401 --> 00:13:38.971
Accepting your fate?

00:13:39.004 --> 00:13:40.507
Well, then as you wish!

00:13:40.541 --> 00:13:43.680
I shall put an end to
all of this suffering.

00:13:43.713 --> 00:13:45.784
It's been such
a pleasure, Maam.

00:13:45.817 --> 00:13:47.153
And don't worry,

00:13:47.186 --> 00:13:49.357
I'm sure your friends will
be joining you soon enough!

00:13:57.508 --> 00:13:59.845
[pained scream]

00:14:05.857 --> 00:14:08.062
Albinass: H-How?

00:14:09.899 --> 00:14:11.235
Maam: You may be fast,

00:14:11.268 --> 00:14:13.840
but even you can't dodge
that much shrapnel.

00:14:13.874 --> 00:14:15.577
And because of how
fast you were going,

00:14:15.611 --> 00:14:19.451
it's done even more damage to
your armor than I'd hoped for.

00:14:19.485 --> 00:14:22.991
Your greatest strength
was also your weakness.

00:14:24.094 --> 00:14:25.430
Maam: With me on my back,

00:14:25.463 --> 00:14:28.369
the only way you could
attack was head-on,

00:14:28.402 --> 00:14:30.339
and you charged
straight into my trap.

00:14:30.373 --> 00:14:33.012
All I had to do was wait
for the right moment.

00:14:33.045 --> 00:14:35.650
You just lost this
one, Albinass.

00:14:42.063 --> 00:14:44.869
Albinass: No...
Not yet, you brat...

00:14:44.902 --> 00:14:46.606
It's not over yet!

00:14:49.244 --> 00:14:52.384
Maam [thought]: I'm sorry,
but I have to do this.

00:14:52.417 --> 00:14:56.124
This will be...
the last attack I go for!

00:14:59.599 --> 00:15:01.836
Warrior-Master Style...

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.107
Tiger Shatter Fist!

00:15:25.551 --> 00:15:27.086
Gotcha.

00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:35.937
Albinass: Don't
come any closer.

00:15:37.875 --> 00:15:40.981
You've beaten me.
I accept it.

00:15:41.414 --> 00:15:42.685
It appears...

00:15:42.718 --> 00:15:44.922
that underestimating you...

00:15:44.956 --> 00:15:47.694
was a very costly mistake.

00:15:48.697 --> 00:15:50.299
Albinass...

00:15:50.333 --> 00:15:53.339
Albinass: With my core
penetrated like this,

00:15:53.372 --> 00:15:55.744
my body will
destruct any moment.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.985
I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.

00:16:00.019 --> 00:16:02.959
I didn't... have a choice.

00:16:02.992 --> 00:16:04.361
[cynical chuckle]

00:16:04.394 --> 00:16:07.134
There's no need to apologize.

00:16:07.167 --> 00:16:09.204
If you hadn't done it,

00:16:09.237 --> 00:16:12.176
I would have killed
you without any remorse.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:14.447
But you are much
stronger than I am.

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:20.226
Not just in battle, but in your
ability to care for others.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.165
It's really as
simple as that.

00:16:23.199 --> 00:16:26.438
I don't regret this,
but it's a shame:

00:16:26.471 --> 00:16:30.479
to realize... that because I
was only a piece on the board,

00:16:30.514 --> 00:16:32.518
waiting to be moved,

00:16:32.552 --> 00:16:35.222
my will could never be
as strong as a human's.

00:16:37.093 --> 00:16:39.064
Albinass: But, Lord Hadlar...

00:16:39.097 --> 00:16:41.234
I wanted him to go on,

00:16:41.268 --> 00:16:45.577
whether it was for moments,
or merely a second longer...

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:49.752
Even if it wound up costing
me the very life he gave.

00:16:53.627 --> 00:16:56.966
Albinass: You take
it from here. Leave me.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.074
But if you will, grant
me one last request...

00:17:01.108 --> 00:17:04.447
And witness my
lord's final glory.

00:17:13.399 --> 00:17:14.602
Maam [thought]: Albinass...

00:17:14.636 --> 00:17:17.073
You were more than
just another piece.

00:17:17.107 --> 00:17:18.577
I know that much
without a doubt.

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:20.947
The way you felt
about Hadlar proves it.

00:17:20.981 --> 00:17:23.418
You might have refused
to admit what it was...

00:17:23.452 --> 00:17:26.058
But that was the most
human thing about you.

00:17:26.091 --> 00:17:29.430
We call that feeling "love".

00:17:34.876 --> 00:17:37.380
Hyunckel: Bloody Scryde!

00:17:39.685 --> 00:17:42.658
Hym [thought]: D-Damnit...
How can I be so weak?

00:17:42.692 --> 00:17:43.627
No!

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.697
[falling yell]

00:17:50.607 --> 00:17:55.784
Hym. You weren't a weak
adversary, just an unlucky one.

00:17:55.818 --> 00:17:56.819
You didn't know it,

00:17:56.853 --> 00:17:58.455
but you were
facing me right after

00:17:58.488 --> 00:18:00.392
I had awakened to a new power.

00:18:02.597 --> 00:18:04.301
Maam: Hyunckel!

00:18:04.334 --> 00:18:06.438
I take it you defeated
the queen alright?

00:18:06.471 --> 00:18:10.446
Yeah. It was all thanks to
Lon Beruk's Dark Armor Fist.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.818
Good, the pawn
is done as well.

00:18:12.852 --> 00:18:14.421
From what I could gather,

00:18:14.454 --> 00:18:16.893
the Guard's trying to
stall us, while Hadlar...

00:18:16.926 --> 00:18:19.532
He has one last
showdown with Dai.

00:18:19.565 --> 00:18:20.667
Yes...

00:18:21.736 --> 00:18:23.773
Hyunckel: Guess we should
hurry back and stop him.

00:18:27.881 --> 00:18:29.150
What was that?

00:18:29.183 --> 00:18:30.353
Must be Popp.

00:18:30.386 --> 00:18:32.023
Wonder who he's fighting...

00:18:32.056 --> 00:18:33.359
Maam [thought]:
It's Sigma, the knight.

00:18:33.392 --> 00:18:35.263
He's the one with
the Mirror of Shahal...

00:18:35.296 --> 00:18:37.802
and that means he
can reflect any spell.

00:18:37.835 --> 00:18:40.707
Wait, if Popp uses Medroa...

00:18:43.212 --> 00:18:45.449
Are you...
worried about him?

00:18:46.786 --> 00:18:47.888
Maam: I am...

00:18:47.921 --> 00:18:49.090
Hyunckel: You shouldn't be.

00:18:49.124 --> 00:18:50.528
With Popp's soul
power unleashed,

00:18:50.561 --> 00:18:52.463
even I would have
trouble taking him on.

00:18:52.496 --> 00:18:54.735
He might be a little
tired from the trip up,

00:18:54.769 --> 00:18:57.039
but I doubt a member
of the Royal Guard

00:18:57.073 --> 00:18:58.408
would be a match for him.

00:18:58.442 --> 00:19:00.581
Maam: You're right.
He'll be okay.

00:19:00.614 --> 00:19:03.151
We should trust that
he can handle himself.

00:19:11.268 --> 00:19:14.742
Maam, what's got you so
concerned about him anyway?

00:19:14.776 --> 00:19:17.715
I mean, if it were
Dai or me up there,

00:19:17.748 --> 00:19:21.155
something tells me you
wouldn't be this bothered.

00:19:21.188 --> 00:19:24.662
Come on. You and Dai
are both absurdly strong.

00:19:24.695 --> 00:19:28.570
No matter what you face, you
always pull through on your own.

00:19:28.603 --> 00:19:30.774
But, well, Popp...

00:19:30.807 --> 00:19:34.347
Popp's strong too, but...
he's always so careless

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.253
whenever somebody's not there
to tell him what to do.

00:19:37.287 --> 00:19:39.658
It's difficult
to watch sometimes.

00:19:41.061 --> 00:19:42.229
Maam [thought]:
That's it.

00:19:42.263 --> 00:19:45.804
I've always been Popp's
worst critic, haven't I?

00:19:45.837 --> 00:19:46.773
And that means...

00:19:46.806 --> 00:19:49.545
He was always trying
so hard to get stronger

00:19:49.578 --> 00:19:52.551
because he wanted
to change my mind.

00:19:52.584 --> 00:19:54.822
I can't believe
I didn't see that.

00:19:58.228 --> 00:19:59.430
Hyunckel: Maam.

00:20:01.636 --> 00:20:02.939
Hyunckel...

00:20:02.972 --> 00:20:04.642
Remember what Popp said?

00:20:04.675 --> 00:20:08.516
The power of your
soul... is love. Love.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:11.087
That pulled me
out of darkness.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.358
I'll always be
grateful for that.

00:20:13.391 --> 00:20:15.429
But there are two
kinds of love:

00:20:15.463 --> 00:20:17.299
The kind driven
by compassion,

00:20:17.333 --> 00:20:19.304
and the kind that's
something more.

00:20:19.337 --> 00:20:21.308
What do you mean,
"something more"?

00:20:21.341 --> 00:20:22.678
You're always helping others.

00:20:22.711 --> 00:20:25.349
It's like a second
nature for you.

00:20:25.383 --> 00:20:27.687
That's certainly
the spirit of Love.

00:20:27.721 --> 00:20:31.829
But, after this battle ends,
and everyone's cared for...

00:20:31.863 --> 00:20:35.335
a day will come for you to have
someone to love for yourself.

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.510
Someone to love...

00:20:38.543 --> 00:20:41.582
You mean, like...
how Amy loves you?

00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:44.454
I still... I don't think
I can feel that way.

00:20:44.488 --> 00:20:46.258
I don't know if I...

00:20:46.291 --> 00:20:49.932
But... but I still
want to be around her.

00:20:49.965 --> 00:20:54.675
Love is... an emotion that
exists beyond our control.

00:20:54.708 --> 00:20:57.647
No wonder sometimes
it leads people astray.

00:20:57.681 --> 00:21:01.354
Like how Baran
and I fell to evil.

00:21:01.388 --> 00:21:03.058
Maam [thought]: Or like
how Merle and Albinass

00:21:03.091 --> 00:21:06.966
were both willing to sacrifice
themselves for someone else.

00:21:08.269 --> 00:21:10.574
Maam, life's too
short to wonder.

00:21:10.607 --> 00:21:13.345
If you have any feeling for
Popp you can't explain....

00:21:13.378 --> 00:21:15.216
then don't let it go cold...

00:21:15.249 --> 00:21:17.588
you should tell him
while you have the chance.

00:21:17.621 --> 00:21:20.960
So leave Dai to me.
Do what you gotta do.

00:21:21.929 --> 00:21:23.298
Hyunckel...

00:21:24.601 --> 00:21:28.441
Go on. Popp's still
waiting for an answer.

00:21:37.359 --> 00:21:39.631
Thanks. I owe you
one, Hyunckel.

00:21:40.734 --> 00:21:42.938
Hyunckel [thought]:
Thank you, Maam...

00:21:42.971 --> 00:21:46.345
The angel of Love who
brought me back to the light.

00:21:46.378 --> 00:21:49.150
You deserve to have
someone who cares for you

00:21:49.184 --> 00:21:51.823
as much as you
care for others.

00:21:51.856 --> 00:21:55.196
And may whoever that
is bring you happiness...

00:21:55.229 --> 00:21:59.103
The kind I could
never bring you myself.

00:23:37.634 --> 00:23:39.872
Narrator: Now that Hym and
Albinass have been defeated,

00:23:39.906 --> 00:23:43.779
Popp finds himself in stalemate
against Hadlar's knight, Sigma.

00:23:43.813 --> 00:23:46.485
But when Sigma unleashes
the Mirror of Shahal,

00:23:46.519 --> 00:23:49.257
the young mage finds
himself unable to counter,

00:23:49.291 --> 00:23:51.529
and his own magic
turned against him.

00:23:51.562 --> 00:23:53.633
As the battle approaches
its crescendo,

00:23:53.666 --> 00:23:56.070
both contenders will
attempt one final gambit.

00:23:56.104 --> 00:23:58.510
See who will triumph -
on the next episode of

00:23:58.543 --> 00:24:00.680
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:00.714 --> 00:24:03.184
"Victory or Annihilation".
