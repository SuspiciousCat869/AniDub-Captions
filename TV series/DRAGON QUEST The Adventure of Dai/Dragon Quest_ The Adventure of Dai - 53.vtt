WEBVTT

00:01:52.692 --> 00:01:54.228
Fenbren: Got you!

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.837
Fenbren: Baran... falls!

00:02:03.046 --> 00:02:05.685
[roaring]

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:14.970
Fenbren [thought]:
What... was that...

00:02:15.003 --> 00:02:17.341
Avan Strash?!

00:02:17.374 --> 00:02:19.746
That pathetic... kid...

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:23.486
It's like I
was made to lose-

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.329
To lose to everyone-
like I never stood a chance!

00:02:28.998 --> 00:02:33.373
Curse you! Curse you all!

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:38.016
Dai [thought]:
It was all instinct.

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.253
I've never felt
that before.

00:02:40.287 --> 00:02:43.761
It's like the sword's
will and mine were one.

00:02:43.794 --> 00:02:45.665
I forgot all about the seal.

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:48.269
All I could think
about was saving...

00:02:51.308 --> 00:02:53.747
Baran: So. This is
your new weapon.

00:02:54.683 --> 00:02:55.918
Impressive.

00:03:00.327 --> 00:03:02.197
Baran: With both
of our blades,

00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:05.771
not even the legendary
Dark Citadel Gate will hold.

00:03:08.877 --> 00:03:10.380
Let's go, Dai.

00:03:10.414 --> 00:03:13.987
Put everything you've
got into this single strike.

00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:14.989
Dai: Okay.

00:03:26.646 --> 00:03:27.915
Dai: It worked!

00:03:37.234 --> 00:03:38.871
This is no earthquake...

00:03:43.681 --> 00:03:45.985
Mystvearn [thought]:
They've actually breached it.

00:03:46.018 --> 00:03:50.393
That gate was sealed by
the Dark King's own power.

00:03:55.938 --> 00:03:58.443
Send for another, Mystvearn.

00:03:58.476 --> 00:03:59.846
Mystvearn: Yes, sire.

00:04:01.016 --> 00:04:04.421
How very impressive.

00:04:04.455 --> 00:04:08.531
Dai: We did it. The entrance
to Vearn Palace is open.

00:04:08.564 --> 00:04:10.635
Baran: We were
bound to succeed.

00:04:10.668 --> 00:04:13.406
The combined might
of two Dragon Knights

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:16.747
is a force this
world has never known.

00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:20.186
But breaching the gate
is only the beginning.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.990
Keep your guard up.

00:04:23.393 --> 00:04:27.568
Our real target is
the Dark King. Come now.

00:04:29.573 --> 00:04:32.912
This shaking...
it can only mean...

00:04:32.945 --> 00:04:36.452
Dai and Baran actually
breached the hidden gate.

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:44.536
[realizing breath]

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:47.642
Fenbren has fallen!

00:04:47.675 --> 00:04:48.610
Hym: No!

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.548
Hym!

00:04:50.581 --> 00:04:52.418
Where are you going-
stop this!

00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:54.489
I'm going to
avenge my brother.

00:04:54.523 --> 00:04:55.758
Albinass: You will not.

00:04:57.562 --> 00:04:58.396
B-But...

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.968
Have you really
forgotten? Hym;

00:05:01.002 --> 00:05:03.439
You swore a vow
to Lord Hadlar.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.753
After Fenbren's disobedience,

00:05:09.786 --> 00:05:13.492
how could we possibly
abandon our position now?

00:05:14.161 --> 00:05:15.998
Yes, you're right.

00:05:17.434 --> 00:05:20.474
I realize that our
purpose here is to allow

00:05:20.508 --> 00:05:24.750
Lord Hadlar to fight
Dai and Baran alone.

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:25.685
W-What?!

00:05:25.718 --> 00:05:26.953
That means...

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.362
We'll have to take
care of you ourselves.

00:05:35.872 --> 00:05:38.143
Popp [thought]: Hadlar
really thinks he can take on

00:05:38.176 --> 00:05:40.681
two Dragon Knights
at the same time?

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:51.069
Hadlar?!

00:05:51.102 --> 00:05:53.139
And he's... alone.

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:57.615
[pained roar]

00:06:10.207 --> 00:06:11.877
Albinass: Impossible.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.379
How can he even stand?!

00:06:13.412 --> 00:06:17.822
Perfect. I wouldn't
have this any other way.

00:06:19.358 --> 00:06:20.127
Popp: Hyunckel!

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.863
Everyone - get up.

00:06:21.897 --> 00:06:25.938
We'll deal with them,
then go after Dai and Baran.

00:06:27.608 --> 00:06:29.846
Even after taking
all that damage...

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:32.886
He still made his way
to the battlefield.

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:36.560
Is he even actually
human? How can he be?

00:06:36.593 --> 00:06:39.131
No, I think he
must be immortal.

00:06:39.164 --> 00:06:41.803
Just like us.

00:06:43.874 --> 00:06:46.212
Maam [thought]:
Hyunckel, this is crazy.

00:06:46.246 --> 00:06:48.517
How did you even get here?

00:06:49.318 --> 00:06:51.088
Crocodine: [chuckling]

00:06:51.121 --> 00:06:53.392
Crocodine [thought]: That
magnificent, reckless fool.

00:06:53.426 --> 00:06:55.597
Crocodine: Hey,
you big brute...

00:06:57.267 --> 00:07:00.607
I've had just
about enough of you!

00:07:06.185 --> 00:07:07.722
[victorious chirping]

00:07:07.755 --> 00:07:10.460
But, Hyunckel...
are you sure about this?

00:07:10.493 --> 00:07:12.230
It won't be easy.

00:07:12.264 --> 00:07:13.901
Hyunckel: Don't
worry about me.

00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:15.103
He's right.

00:07:15.137 --> 00:07:18.210
What's worrying about the guy
gonna accomplish, anyway?

00:07:18.243 --> 00:07:19.411
Nothing!

00:07:19.444 --> 00:07:21.316
He's gonna do
whatever he wants!

00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:22.384
Hey - Popp!

00:07:22.417 --> 00:07:24.454
Popp: I'm glad
you're here, Hyunckel.

00:07:25.557 --> 00:07:29.632
Having you standing behind
us is more than enough.

00:07:29.666 --> 00:07:34.007
You're still our senior...
Disciple of Avan.

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:37.849
He's right.

00:07:37.882 --> 00:07:41.155
Even if you can't
fight alongside us...

00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:43.894
You showing up is the
kind of courageous act

00:07:43.927 --> 00:07:47.067
that we need in
moments like this.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.637
We won't lose.

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:52.244
You can sit this
one out, Hyunckel.

00:07:52.277 --> 00:07:54.247
I appreciate the concern...

00:07:54.281 --> 00:07:58.289
but standing by while you fight
may be even harder for me.

00:07:58.322 --> 00:07:59.859
Let's do this.

00:08:00.493 --> 00:08:02.163
Take a compliment.

00:08:05.671 --> 00:08:07.842
No more bishop...

00:08:07.875 --> 00:08:09.144
Is it dead?

00:08:09.178 --> 00:08:10.246
Probably.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.250
Dai and Baran must've won.

00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:13.653
Dai and Baran?

00:08:14.789 --> 00:08:17.427
It looks like they already
had our plan figured out.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:21.102
Hadlar's waiting
to take them both on.

00:08:21.135 --> 00:08:24.643
Hyunckel [thought]: He plans
to fight two Dragon Knights...

00:08:24.676 --> 00:08:26.478
Does he stand a chance?

00:08:26.513 --> 00:08:29.318
Or does he intend to die?

00:08:29.351 --> 00:08:32.626
Or... could it be both?

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:34.261
We need to get moving.

00:08:34.294 --> 00:08:36.633
Let's not show them any mercy.

00:08:36.667 --> 00:08:39.839
Hym: That's supposed
to be our line.

00:08:39.872 --> 00:08:44.047
You aren't the only ones who
can't afford to lose this fight.

00:08:44.081 --> 00:08:47.955
Let's end this pointless
saga once and for all.

00:08:47.989 --> 00:08:52.097
So, let's see which of
us will get the honor!

00:08:56.372 --> 00:08:58.877
Hadlar: I don't
have much time.

00:08:59.779 --> 00:09:02.985
So why don't we begin, then?

00:09:03.019 --> 00:09:05.691
What kind of
game is this, Hadlar?

00:09:05.725 --> 00:09:08.430
Do you really think the
two of us are so weak...

00:09:08.463 --> 00:09:12.004
that you can win this
thing by yourself?

00:09:12.037 --> 00:09:12.905
[chuckling]

00:09:12.938 --> 00:09:14.041
Of course not.

00:09:14.074 --> 00:09:16.947
Dragon Knights are
the ultimate creations,

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:21.055
a vision from
the gods, themselves.

00:09:21.088 --> 00:09:24.395
Knowing that one
was serving under me...

00:09:24.428 --> 00:09:26.733
It filled me with fear.

00:09:26.767 --> 00:09:31.208
Fear that someday you
would come after my throne.

00:09:31.241 --> 00:09:35.618
And when I learned Dai here
was also a Dragon Knight,

00:09:35.651 --> 00:09:38.088
I knew that day would come.

00:09:38.122 --> 00:09:42.899
I imagined the two of you
working together to defeat me.

00:09:42.932 --> 00:09:46.305
Now that fear has
become a reality.

00:09:46.339 --> 00:09:50.548
Nevertheless, I find myself
looking forward to this.

00:09:50.581 --> 00:09:53.720
Life can be
strange, can it not?

00:09:53.754 --> 00:09:57.127
Dai [thought]: He's been
planning to fight both of us

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.664
from the start.

00:09:58.697 --> 00:10:02.706
Hadlar: Fenbren's
insubordination was unexpected.

00:10:02.739 --> 00:10:05.143
It seems that within me,

00:10:05.176 --> 00:10:08.015
there was still some
lingering narcissism

00:10:08.049 --> 00:10:11.488
and a desire for glory
in battle, after all.

00:10:11.523 --> 00:10:12.992
The Forbidden Magic I used

00:10:13.026 --> 00:10:16.966
imbued his personality
with both those things.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.709
Children tend to grow up to be
their parents, don't they?

00:10:23.112 --> 00:10:26.820
Now I shall defeat
Dai, the Hero!

00:10:26.854 --> 00:10:31.763
And Baran, if you should choose
to defend the boy in any way,

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:34.802
I will destroy both
of you for good.

00:10:35.504 --> 00:10:36.573
Baran: You fool!

00:10:36.606 --> 00:10:39.946
Spare me your
arrogance, Hadlar.

00:10:39.979 --> 00:10:43.119
It seems that your power
has grown in some ways...

00:10:43.152 --> 00:10:45.992
But do not assume that you
have the strength to take on

00:10:46.025 --> 00:10:48.630
two Dragon Knights
at one time.

00:10:48.663 --> 00:10:52.771
The cost will be immensely
high, I can assure you.

00:11:13.346 --> 00:11:14.181
Dai: Wait!

00:11:14.214 --> 00:11:16.854
I don't think
Hadlar's being arrogant;

00:11:16.887 --> 00:11:19.425
He's transformed into
a Superior Being.

00:11:19.458 --> 00:11:21.062
A Superior Being?

00:11:21.095 --> 00:11:23.701
Dai: Yes. I think he
might be way more powerful

00:11:23.734 --> 00:11:25.905
than either one of us.

00:11:25.938 --> 00:11:28.042
That's why we have to
him fight together!

00:11:28.076 --> 00:11:31.048
It's the only sure way
that we can win this thing.

00:11:31.082 --> 00:11:31.883
Nonsense.

00:11:31.917 --> 00:11:33.887
Don't you know your
strength, boy?

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.325
There's no need
to fight together.

00:11:36.358 --> 00:11:39.766
Have you no pride at all
in being a Dragon Knight?

00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:43.573
If I could win this with
just pride, I would.

00:11:43.606 --> 00:11:45.678
Dai: You already
said it yourself.

00:11:45.711 --> 00:11:48.884
Our real target is King Vearn.

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:50.286
[frustrated growl]

00:11:52.859 --> 00:11:54.896
Vearn: And so it begins.

00:11:54.929 --> 00:11:59.338
The great climactic battle
we've all been waiting for.

00:11:59.371 --> 00:12:02.243
Who will gain the upper hand?

00:12:02.277 --> 00:12:05.618
Mystvearn: Hadlar may
have become quite powerful,

00:12:05.651 --> 00:12:11.563
but against the full fury of
Dai and Baran, he cannot win.

00:12:11.597 --> 00:12:14.502
Isolating himself
from his Royal Guard

00:12:14.535 --> 00:12:17.140
was an act of pure madness.

00:12:17.173 --> 00:12:18.710
Madness, you say?

00:12:18.744 --> 00:12:21.214
No. He's desperate.

00:12:21.248 --> 00:12:23.118
He's backed himself
into a corner

00:12:23.152 --> 00:12:25.323
to push his
strength even further.

00:12:25.356 --> 00:12:26.626
Don't you see?

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.699
Quite a clever ploy
for our Hadlar.

00:12:29.732 --> 00:12:31.301
Mystvearn: But,
should he be defeated,

00:12:31.335 --> 00:12:36.513
the Dragons will gain entrance
to the citadel, will they not?

00:12:36.547 --> 00:12:38.416
Vearn: That won't happen.

00:12:38.449 --> 00:12:39.618
Mystvearn: No?

00:12:39.652 --> 00:12:44.028
I believe they will find it
quite impossible, Mystvearn.

00:12:44.061 --> 00:12:48.803
The father and son
will never see my face.

00:12:50.775 --> 00:12:52.978
I was mistaken, Dai.

00:12:53.012 --> 00:12:55.918
I was sure that you had
grown as a warrior...

00:12:55.952 --> 00:12:58.590
But it seems to me that
you're still far from

00:12:58.623 --> 00:13:00.827
becoming a true Dragon Knight.

00:13:00.861 --> 00:13:02.932
You're mistaking
arrogance for pride.

00:13:02.965 --> 00:13:05.002
There's more important
things at stake.

00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:08.475
I don't need to be a "true
Dragon Knight" to see that.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:10.681
Besides, I'm part human...

00:13:10.715 --> 00:13:12.985
I'll never be
the same as you.

00:13:16.057 --> 00:13:17.929
I'm fighting
for all my friends.

00:13:17.962 --> 00:13:20.735
And I'm going to do
the very best I can-

00:13:20.768 --> 00:13:22.437
the best I'm capable of.

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:27.013
For me, defeating Vearn and
Hadlar means saving the world.

00:13:27.047 --> 00:13:29.919
My pride isn't going
to get in the way.

00:13:30.588 --> 00:13:32.223
Dai...

00:13:32.257 --> 00:13:35.831
Hadlar: Enough talk.
Who will fight?

00:13:35.864 --> 00:13:39.605
Or are both of you too afraid?

00:13:42.143 --> 00:13:44.949
Let's settle this,
Hadlar! Just us!

00:13:44.982 --> 00:13:47.622
If you're not gonna
listen to reason, Baran,

00:13:47.655 --> 00:13:50.059
I don't have a choice.

00:13:50.092 --> 00:13:53.065
You'll see in just
a few seconds.

00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:56.405
So the boy dies first.

00:13:56.439 --> 00:13:58.008
We'll see!

00:14:00.179 --> 00:14:02.016
Hadlar has a hidden sword?!

00:14:02.719 --> 00:14:04.320
[roaring]

00:14:09.733 --> 00:14:11.869
[roaring]

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.443
Hadlar: [laughing]

00:14:15.477 --> 00:14:16.680
Good, Dai!

00:14:16.713 --> 00:14:21.455
You've truly improved since the
last time we crossed blades.

00:14:31.041 --> 00:14:32.945
Baran [thought]: Dai
was right about him...

00:14:32.978 --> 00:14:36.418
The power of the attacks
he's unleashing rivals my own.

00:14:37.655 --> 00:14:39.324
Hadlar: How very generous.

00:14:40.359 --> 00:14:43.165
Hadlar: To fight in
place of your father,

00:14:43.198 --> 00:14:46.539
who has no
experience against me.

00:14:46.573 --> 00:14:47.976
However...

00:14:48.009 --> 00:14:50.881
it's not as though
you know the full extent

00:14:50.915 --> 00:14:54.154
of my powers either, boy.

00:14:57.326 --> 00:14:59.264
What kind of weapon is that?!

00:14:59.297 --> 00:15:01.067
Hell's Chain!

00:15:04.976 --> 00:15:06.478
[pained cry]

00:15:07.748 --> 00:15:09.284
Boom!

00:15:25.584 --> 00:15:27.655
Avan... Strash!

00:15:27.688 --> 00:15:29.592
Kaboom!

00:15:36.405 --> 00:15:37.373
Dai!

00:15:39.579 --> 00:15:43.452
Dai... Are you all right?

00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:46.291
[pained groaning]

00:15:46.325 --> 00:15:47.595
[chuckle]

00:15:47.628 --> 00:15:49.598
Wh-what did I tell you?

00:15:50.499 --> 00:15:52.470
Baran: I see now.

00:15:52.504 --> 00:15:57.346
Hadlar's power is great.
He's a menace.

00:16:00.754 --> 00:16:03.159
Well, well. Dai.

00:16:03.192 --> 00:16:07.735
Even after all this time.
You still surprise me.

00:16:07.768 --> 00:16:09.137
You and me both.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:13.546
He completely negated my
Strash with his Kaboom spell.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.719
A wound like that will
regenerate in no time.

00:16:20.561 --> 00:16:21.996
It can't be!

00:16:22.397 --> 00:16:24.067
No... it is!

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.771
The infernal coal.

00:16:25.804 --> 00:16:27.608
A Black Core!

00:16:27.641 --> 00:16:29.044
What's a "black core"?

00:16:29.077 --> 00:16:30.814
Baran [thought]:
How could the Dark King

00:16:30.848 --> 00:16:33.285
do something so barbaric?

00:16:33.319 --> 00:16:37.326
To implant such a device
in his own servant...

00:16:38.697 --> 00:16:40.433
Mystvearn: A Black Core?!

00:16:40.466 --> 00:16:44.942
And you hid this in
the body you gave Hadlar?

00:16:44.975 --> 00:16:47.347
Vearn: Now do you understand?

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:51.455
I told you those two
will never see my face.

00:16:51.488 --> 00:16:54.460
If they manage
to defeat Hadlar,

00:16:54.494 --> 00:16:58.302
they will detonate the Black
Core hidden in his body,

00:16:58.336 --> 00:17:03.379
creating a destructive blast.
At the very least...

00:17:03.412 --> 00:17:07.086
We can bring this
battle to a draw.

00:17:07.654 --> 00:17:08.656
Mystvearn: A draw?

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:13.232
It will blow away the
entire Field of Death.

00:17:13.266 --> 00:17:16.138
Vearn: Perhaps,
but no matter.

00:17:16.171 --> 00:17:19.612
No harm will
befall my palace.

00:17:20.814 --> 00:17:22.250
After all,

00:17:22.284 --> 00:17:26.626
their battle is taking
place out on the perimeter.

00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:32.705
That thing's... a bomb?

00:17:32.739 --> 00:17:33.940
Baran: That's right.

00:17:33.973 --> 00:17:38.048
A super-powered one from the
Underworld called a Black Core.

00:17:38.082 --> 00:17:39.719
It's a nightmarish weapon-

00:17:39.752 --> 00:17:43.526
one even more devastating
than you can imagine.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.264
But... How do
you know about that?

00:17:46.298 --> 00:17:49.671
I've seen it before.
When I was in the Underworld.

00:17:49.705 --> 00:17:54.047
Black Cores are made from
a stone called Black Crystal.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.951
It's found deep
in the Underworld

00:17:55.985 --> 00:17:58.790
and absorbs power
from the very earth.

00:17:58.823 --> 00:18:02.063
They're weaponized
using Old Magic.

00:18:02.096 --> 00:18:05.302
However, due to their
extreme destructive power,

00:18:05.335 --> 00:18:08.342
even evil creatures who have
dedicated their existence

00:18:08.376 --> 00:18:13.252
to Forbidden Magic fear
using these Black Cores.

00:18:13.286 --> 00:18:14.888
Thirteen years ago,

00:18:14.922 --> 00:18:18.864
when Hadlar was Dark Lord and
ravaged the surface world,

00:18:18.897 --> 00:18:24.440
I fought Velzar, King of
the Abyss, in the Underworld.

00:18:25.476 --> 00:18:28.650
During that battle in
the depths of the earth,

00:18:28.683 --> 00:18:32.758
Velzar used a
Black Core against me.

00:18:32.792 --> 00:18:34.061
Dai: What happened?

00:18:34.094 --> 00:18:38.168
Baran: His entire
region was vaporized.

00:18:39.806 --> 00:18:45.382
In his attempt to vanquish me,
he destroyed his own kingdom.

00:18:46.051 --> 00:18:49.224
After that, even Velzar...

00:18:49.258 --> 00:18:52.999
He refused to use
a Black Core again.

00:18:53.032 --> 00:18:54.602
His great ambition...

00:18:54.636 --> 00:18:59.578
Was to rule the Underworld and
conquer the surface continents.

00:18:59.612 --> 00:19:03.686
He wasn't going to risk
destroying them both.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.124
Baran [thought]: But for
Vearn to resort to using

00:19:06.157 --> 00:19:07.795
a Black Core...

00:19:07.828 --> 00:19:12.170
It seems his plan is not
to rule the surface world,

00:19:12.203 --> 00:19:15.510
but to annihilate
it completely.

00:19:18.883 --> 00:19:23.459
Vearn: I never intended for
Hadlar to be a sacrificial pawn.

00:19:23.492 --> 00:19:26.666
But when I saved him
from the brink of death,

00:19:26.699 --> 00:19:30.541
I implanted the
Black Core as insurance.

00:19:30.574 --> 00:19:36.352
Then he went and transformed
himself into a Superior Being.

00:19:36.385 --> 00:19:40.460
This was something
even I did not expect.

00:19:40.493 --> 00:19:44.334
The increase in his power
has had an adverse effect

00:19:44.367 --> 00:19:46.338
on the Black Core.

00:19:46.371 --> 00:19:49.044
It is no longer stable.

00:19:49.077 --> 00:19:53.385
The bomb could be
set off at any moment.

00:19:54.521 --> 00:19:58.228
I believe that this will
manifest itself in Hadlar

00:19:58.262 --> 00:20:00.900
with bouts of
excruciating agony.

00:20:00.934 --> 00:20:04.273
Of course, he'll likely
assume that the pain is

00:20:04.307 --> 00:20:08.716
a product of the little
experiment done to his body.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:13.225
Knowing the outcome of a
battle is a boring thing...

00:20:13.258 --> 00:20:16.131
A horrible shame.

00:20:16.164 --> 00:20:20.907
But even still,
we must see it through.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.513
He has been a valuable servant,

00:20:23.546 --> 00:20:26.185
but this may be
the final performance

00:20:26.218 --> 00:20:28.790
of our dear old Hadlar.

00:20:31.127 --> 00:20:32.430
Mystvearn [thought]: Tragic...

00:20:32.463 --> 00:20:36.037
Finally finding
the warrior inside him

00:20:36.071 --> 00:20:39.845
has ultimately
shortened his life.

00:20:39.878 --> 00:20:42.250
Ironic, even.

00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:46.626
While I would prefer that
he win and survive...

00:20:46.659 --> 00:20:52.103
Should he fall, at least he'll
go out in a blaze of glory.

00:20:52.137 --> 00:20:54.174
If only he knew
that his demise

00:20:54.207 --> 00:20:57.514
could bring our
Dark king victory.

00:21:00.854 --> 00:21:04.093
If the Black Core explodes,
we'll be in trouble.

00:21:04.126 --> 00:21:05.897
What do we do?

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:07.167
I don't know.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.569
Dai: What?!

00:21:08.603 --> 00:21:12.511
And Dai, we can't use any spells
or swords in this battle.

00:21:12.544 --> 00:21:14.716
Fight only with blunt force.

00:21:14.749 --> 00:21:18.155
Hang on - seriously?
But we'll never win!

00:21:18.189 --> 00:21:20.392
Baran: Just listen to me!

00:21:20.426 --> 00:21:22.363
That Black Core
has been imbued with

00:21:22.397 --> 00:21:24.768
a terrifying amount
of Magic Power.

00:21:24.802 --> 00:21:27.340
It must be completely
filled after absorbing

00:21:27.373 --> 00:21:30.947
some of Hadlar's
transformed energy, as well.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:34.354
Simply hitting it with a
powerful spell of any kind

00:21:34.387 --> 00:21:36.491
might set it off.

00:21:37.994 --> 00:21:39.899
Hadlar: Are you done planning?

00:21:39.932 --> 00:21:42.103
I'll take you both on!

00:21:42.136 --> 00:21:44.340
Now, ready or not.

00:21:49.652 --> 00:21:53.359
[roaring]

00:21:53.392 --> 00:21:55.162
Hadlar! Is... he-

00:21:55.196 --> 00:21:57.499
Oh, no. He's coming!

00:23:38.803 --> 00:23:40.773
Narrator: To avoid
setting off the Black Core

00:23:40.807 --> 00:23:42.978
and alerting Hadlar
of its presence,

00:23:43.011 --> 00:23:45.751
Dai and Baran must hold
back their attacks.

00:23:45.784 --> 00:23:48.088
But the Dark Lord hounds
them relentlessly,

00:23:48.121 --> 00:23:51.629
and when he prepares to unleash
his Ultra Combustion Slash,

00:23:51.662 --> 00:23:54.301
Baran confronts the
overwhelming onslaught

00:23:54.334 --> 00:23:56.572
with a gambit of his own...

00:23:56.605 --> 00:23:58.475
See how it unfolds
