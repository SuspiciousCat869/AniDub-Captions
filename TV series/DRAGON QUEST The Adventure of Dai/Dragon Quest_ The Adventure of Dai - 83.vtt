WEBVTT

00:02:03.747 --> 00:02:04.783
Ah, welcome back.

00:02:04.816 --> 00:02:07.320
We were starting to worry
you wouldn't wake up.

00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.127
But, Hym...

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.363
All of you...

00:02:11.396 --> 00:02:12.665
What... What happened?

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:15.103
Crocodine: You were in rough
shape when we found you.

00:02:15.136 --> 00:02:16.305
Gave us a scare.

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:17.842
And if it weren't for
this strange little one,

00:02:17.876 --> 00:02:20.581
you'd probably be nothing
more than a cherished memory.

00:02:20.614 --> 00:02:23.353
Mister Beast cast so many
Healing-type spells -

00:02:23.386 --> 00:02:25.357
he could've revived an army!

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.232
Hyunckel: I see...

00:02:29.265 --> 00:02:31.837
Once again the odds
were in my favor...

00:02:33.975 --> 00:02:35.277
Hym: That makes two of us.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.749
This fellow may be small,
but his magic is fearsome.

00:02:37.783 --> 00:02:40.220
I have to admit, it was
quite an odd sensation

00:02:40.254 --> 00:02:42.358
to be patched up with
a Healing-type spell.

00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:44.963
Not sure how, but it worked.
I'm back in action.

00:02:44.996 --> 00:02:46.165
Mr. Beast: It's quite simple.

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.370
You now have the body
of a living organism.

00:02:48.403 --> 00:02:49.506
Your Orichalcum form has become

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:52.044
similar to that of
a Metal Slime...

00:02:52.077 --> 00:02:53.648
perhaps a King Metal Slime.

00:02:53.681 --> 00:02:56.587
If my spells work for them
they'll work for you, too.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.722
Slimes?

00:02:57.755 --> 00:02:59.358
Geez, of all the creatures
you could compare me to...

00:02:59.392 --> 00:03:00.728
Mr. Beast: You, however...

00:03:00.762 --> 00:03:01.697
You might be alive,

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.569
but I'm afraid you'll
never fully recover.

00:03:06.205 --> 00:03:07.642
What?!

00:03:07.675 --> 00:03:09.445
Mr. Beast: It's
the price you must pay

00:03:09.478 --> 00:03:11.382
for your marathon
of battles, Hyunckel.

00:03:11.416 --> 00:03:13.353
I've tended to your
surface injuries,

00:03:13.386 --> 00:03:16.226
but your bones have
suffered irreparable damage.

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:17.595
Given time,

00:03:17.628 --> 00:03:19.633
you'll likely recover enough
strength to walk again...

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:23.707
However, your days of
fighting have come to an end.

00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:25.010
I expected as much.

00:03:25.043 --> 00:03:27.883
You hide great knowledge behind
that disguise, stranger.

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:29.185
You're no ordinary monster.

00:03:29.218 --> 00:03:30.454
Mr. Beast: No, no.

00:03:30.487 --> 00:03:33.794
I'm merely a member of
the Beast King Commandos.

00:03:33.828 --> 00:03:37.569
At any rate,
it's a price worth paying.

00:03:37.602 --> 00:03:40.575
Hyunckel: I've gained something
far more valuable in return.

00:03:40.608 --> 00:03:42.812
A friendship, forged in combat.

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:44.916
Hym [thought]: Friendship?

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.956
Most of the damage he
suffered came by my hand...

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.158
and he forgives me?

00:03:49.192 --> 00:03:51.061
Hyunckel: Crocodine.

00:03:51.095 --> 00:03:52.599
I know I'll only
be a burden...

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:53.934
but I have a favor
to ask of you.

00:03:53.968 --> 00:03:56.372
Would you be willing to
carry me to the castle,

00:03:56.405 --> 00:03:59.045
and bring me to where Dai
and the others are fighting?

00:03:59.078 --> 00:03:59.913
Crocodine: But...

00:03:59.946 --> 00:04:01.349
And do what - cheer 'em on?

00:04:01.382 --> 00:04:02.819
Return to Queen Flora!

00:04:02.852 --> 00:04:03.888
I imagine you're right,

00:04:03.921 --> 00:04:06.092
but I've given everything
I have for this battle

00:04:06.125 --> 00:04:08.362
I want to be
there when it ends.

00:04:08.396 --> 00:04:11.235
When Dai's mighty blade
strikes down the Dark King,

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:12.873
once and for all...

00:04:12.906 --> 00:04:14.776
I won't miss that.

00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:18.885
Well, when you
put it like that...

00:04:18.918 --> 00:04:21.590
As you wish. I'll
lend you my shoulder.

00:04:21.624 --> 00:04:24.830
Even if I refused, you'd
drag yourself there anyway.

00:04:24.863 --> 00:04:25.765
Let's go together.

00:04:25.798 --> 00:04:27.267
That way, if things
happen to get dicey,

00:04:27.301 --> 00:04:29.338
at least you can
use me as a shield.

00:04:29.371 --> 00:04:30.975
[chuckling]

00:04:33.046 --> 00:04:34.047
H-Hym?

00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:35.818
If you need a
shoulder, take mine.

00:04:35.851 --> 00:04:38.189
Besides, you and I have
unfinished business.

00:04:38.223 --> 00:04:39.391
I'll carry you until

00:04:39.425 --> 00:04:41.162
you're strong enough to
settle things properly.

00:04:41.195 --> 00:04:44.535
I can't have you go and die
on me before then, now can I?

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:46.406
I suppose I'm going
to have to treat

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:48.677
all of your enemies as
if they were my own,

00:04:48.711 --> 00:04:51.015
while you sit back
and watch, aren't I?

00:04:52.685 --> 00:04:54.188
Crocodine [thought]:
What do you know...

00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:56.125
This new friend
Hyunckel spoke of

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:58.429
is Lord Hadlar's
favorite pawn.

00:04:58.462 --> 00:05:00.200
Chiu: Well said!

00:05:00.234 --> 00:05:01.670
Chiu: You once
were our enemy,

00:05:01.704 --> 00:05:04.442
but you've proven yourself to
be a monster of noble spirit.

00:05:04.475 --> 00:05:05.779
I like your style!

00:05:05.812 --> 00:05:07.749
Consider this a formal
invitation for you

00:05:07.782 --> 00:05:10.087
to join my
Beast King Commandos.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.921
What?

00:05:10.955 --> 00:05:11.757
"Beast King Commandos"....

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.126
What's this shrimp
talking about?

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:16.332
I'm not a shrimp - and you
will refer to me as Captain!

00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:17.836
[laughing]

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:19.438
You better listen to
what he tells you, Hym.

00:05:19.471 --> 00:05:20.307
No point arguing.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.510
He might not look like much,

00:05:21.544 --> 00:05:24.114
but Chiu's proven to be
a real force of nature.

00:05:24.147 --> 00:05:25.317
Is he serious?

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.385
Absolutely.

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.122
Let's see... I'm
fresh out of badges,

00:05:28.155 --> 00:05:30.026
so we'll have to
improvise here...

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:33.399
Chiu: There. That'll do.

00:05:34.836 --> 00:05:36.874
What is this stuff?
Why won't it come off?

00:05:36.907 --> 00:05:39.078
Why would it? Magic
Brushes are permanent.

00:05:39.111 --> 00:05:40.080
Why, you little...

00:05:40.113 --> 00:05:41.415
Chiu: We just went over this.

00:05:41.448 --> 00:05:42.484
It's not "little"
it's "Captain"!

00:05:42.518 --> 00:05:44.388
Hym: I never agreed to
take orders from

00:05:44.422 --> 00:05:45.658
a shrimp like you...

00:05:45.691 --> 00:05:48.096
Chiu: Stop calling me a shrimp!
I'm warning you...

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:50.066
Hyunckel [thought]:
I wonder if he's managed to

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.302
find the others by now...

00:05:51.335 --> 00:05:53.306
Whatever they might
be facing in there,

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:55.411
there's no doubt in
my mind that he'll be

00:05:55.444 --> 00:05:57.548
the greatest help they
could hope for...

00:05:57.582 --> 00:06:01.856
Land Rider Larhart
carries my will with him.

00:06:09.271 --> 00:06:11.643
Dai [thought]: So...
This is Larhart.

00:06:11.676 --> 00:06:15.651
You know, I can actually see
your father in those eyes.

00:06:15.684 --> 00:06:18.423
Popp: Wait a second. How on
earth are you even alive?

00:06:18.456 --> 00:06:19.693
Like, really?

00:06:19.726 --> 00:06:21.830
And what are you doing
wielding Hyunckel's spear?

00:06:21.864 --> 00:06:24.503
This weapon was mine long
before it was Hyunckel's.

00:06:24.536 --> 00:06:27.274
If anything, it's been returned
to its rightful owner.

00:06:27.307 --> 00:06:28.611
That's not what I meant.

00:06:28.644 --> 00:06:30.848
I'm asking what
happened to our friend.

00:06:30.881 --> 00:06:32.084
Tell us, now!

00:06:32.117 --> 00:06:35.023
He carried out his duty and
used all of his strength.

00:06:35.056 --> 00:06:38.864
It was a glorious battle
indeed, but eventually he fell.

00:06:38.897 --> 00:06:40.067
D-Do you mean...

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.468
Oh, he's still alive.

00:06:41.503 --> 00:06:43.640
Don't forget,
the man's immortal.

00:06:45.744 --> 00:06:47.682
Well, sheesh. Maybe lead
with that next time.

00:06:47.716 --> 00:06:49.786
Dai: Are you saying that
Hyunckel gave you back

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:53.493
the armor so you could
fight in his place?

00:06:53.527 --> 00:06:56.599
Dai: But why? What makes you
want to fight on our side?

00:06:57.201 --> 00:06:59.471
No, not all of you.

00:07:05.618 --> 00:07:08.958
I, Larhart the Land Rider,
fight only for one.

00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:11.362
I shall serve you as
I served Master Baran,

00:07:11.396 --> 00:07:14.702
and I kneel before you now to
pledge my undying allegiance.

00:07:14.736 --> 00:07:17.274
From this moment forth,
I follow your command...

00:07:17.307 --> 00:07:18.544
Master Dino.

00:07:18.577 --> 00:07:21.082
What? M-M-Me?!

00:07:21.115 --> 00:07:22.217
Larhart: Yes, sir.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.455
You really mean it, don't you?
You want to be our ally?

00:07:24.488 --> 00:07:27.127
Larhart: Not merely
your ally. Your follower.

00:07:27.161 --> 00:07:28.096
Follo-wha?

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:30.233
Tell me to die, and
I shall do so gladly.

00:07:30.266 --> 00:07:31.737
Tell me to fight,
and I'll raise

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.909
my Dark Armor Spear against
even the gods themselves.

00:07:34.943 --> 00:07:37.347
In any case,
I am your instrument,

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.988
and you may use
me as you see fit.

00:07:41.022 --> 00:07:43.960
So what now?
I've never had a follower.

00:07:48.236 --> 00:07:52.177
Mystvearn: [furious roar]

00:07:52.845 --> 00:07:54.081
Both: Mystvearn!

00:07:54.115 --> 00:07:55.217
Oh?

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.889
You survived a hit from my
Sunder Claw. Well, well...

00:07:57.922 --> 00:07:58.890
Not bad Mystvearn.

00:07:58.924 --> 00:08:01.329
I can see why you're the
Dark King's heavyweight.

00:08:01.362 --> 00:08:03.600
Mystvearn: Is that so?

00:08:04.503 --> 00:08:06.740
Larhart: Are you
ready, Master Dino?

00:08:06.773 --> 00:08:09.244
Larhart: Feel free to give
me your first command.

00:08:09.277 --> 00:08:11.550
Tell me to defeat
this scourge.

00:08:11.583 --> 00:08:14.054
It would be my
genuine pleasure.

00:08:15.524 --> 00:08:16.693
Mystvearn: What a joke.

00:08:16.727 --> 00:08:17.929
For a disgraced member of

00:08:17.963 --> 00:08:20.534
the Dragon Masters
to betray our ranks,

00:08:20.568 --> 00:08:24.141
and then have the gall
to bare his fangs at me?

00:08:24.876 --> 00:08:27.247
You'll pay dearly for this.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.751
There was no betrayal here.

00:08:28.784 --> 00:08:30.453
We both know
the Dragon Masters

00:08:30.486 --> 00:08:32.491
were never a part
of the Dark Army.

00:08:32.525 --> 00:08:36.065
We served only the Dragon
Knight - no one else.

00:08:36.098 --> 00:08:39.940
Three fearsome warriors
of the land, sea, and sky.

00:08:39.973 --> 00:08:43.046
None of us ever claimed
allegiance to you, or your king.

00:08:43.079 --> 00:08:46.853
Baran was our master. It was
his will we carried, not yours.

00:08:46.887 --> 00:08:50.895
To say that we betrayed
you is the real joke.

00:08:50.928 --> 00:08:53.366
It's time to go,
Master Dino. And quickly.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.604
No way. Mystvearn
is really powerful.

00:08:55.637 --> 00:08:57.541
I should stay and
fight with you.

00:08:58.778 --> 00:08:59.679
Huh?

00:09:00.447 --> 00:09:01.750
Hey...

00:09:05.557 --> 00:09:06.459
Larhart, wait!

00:09:06.492 --> 00:09:07.294
Are you nuts?!

00:09:07.327 --> 00:09:08.296
You're unarmed!

00:09:08.329 --> 00:09:09.532
Mystvearn: What
nonsense is this?

00:09:09.566 --> 00:09:11.903
You said you're going
to make me pay dearly.

00:09:11.936 --> 00:09:13.573
I'm curious how you'll do it.

00:09:13.607 --> 00:09:15.243
Mystvearn: You
insolent fool...

00:09:15.276 --> 00:09:16.946
Just like this.

00:09:19.485 --> 00:09:20.821
Look out!

00:09:24.395 --> 00:09:25.129
Mystvearn: W-What?!

00:09:30.908 --> 00:09:33.380
Larhart: Well,
are you satisfied?

00:09:33.413 --> 00:09:34.683
He might be powerful,

00:09:34.716 --> 00:09:36.385
but there's no
reason to fear someone

00:09:36.419 --> 00:09:37.888
if you know
they'll never hit you.

00:09:37.922 --> 00:09:39.759
Alright... But how did...

00:09:39.792 --> 00:09:42.632
I'm totally stumped. What
on earth did he just do?

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:43.934
An afterimage.

00:09:43.968 --> 00:09:44.903
Huh?

00:09:44.936 --> 00:09:46.606
Maam: It's an
optical illusion.

00:09:46.639 --> 00:09:47.975
When something
moves fast enough,

00:09:48.008 --> 00:09:49.879
it doesn't appear
to move at all.

00:09:49.912 --> 00:09:53.086
Mystvearn attacked an image
that Larhart left behind.

00:09:53.119 --> 00:09:54.221
He's too fast to see,

00:09:54.254 --> 00:09:57.360
and he hasn't even started
fighting at full strength.

00:09:57.393 --> 00:09:58.831
Popp: This guy's a monster...

00:09:58.864 --> 00:10:00.868
Even Mystvearn can't keep up.

00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:03.305
How the hell did
Hyunckel ever beat him?!

00:10:04.441 --> 00:10:05.511
Mystvearn [thought]:
He's strong.

00:10:05.544 --> 00:10:07.716
Perhaps even as
strong as Lon Beruk...

00:10:07.749 --> 00:10:10.186
A real challenge, after all.

00:10:29.526 --> 00:10:30.728
Larhart: Master Dino...

00:10:30.761 --> 00:10:32.631
The only fight you should
be thinking about...

00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:35.169
is the one you intend
to have with King Vearn-

00:10:35.203 --> 00:10:37.474
to defend the kingdoms
of the surface world.

00:10:37.508 --> 00:10:40.615
You must charge straight toward
that goal without wavering.

00:10:40.648 --> 00:10:42.050
Forget everything else.

00:10:42.083 --> 00:10:45.156
I'm willing to sacrifice
myself to help you achieve it.

00:10:45.189 --> 00:10:47.962
You see, it was what your
father requested I do,

00:10:47.995 --> 00:10:50.701
if necessary, in his
final will and testament.

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:52.003
You mean, my dad-

00:10:52.037 --> 00:10:54.710
I was resurrected by
Master Baran's Dragon Blood...

00:10:54.743 --> 00:10:57.380
It was then when I
found it. The letter.

00:11:08.537 --> 00:11:12.211
Larhart: The letter was left
in my coffin for when I awoke.

00:11:12.244 --> 00:11:15.449
For some reason, I already
knew what it was...

00:11:15.483 --> 00:11:19.258
Baran had written the
message specifically for me.

00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:21.161
"I've given the three
of you Dragon Blood,

00:11:21.194 --> 00:11:23.834
but I doubt that the
others are going to make it.

00:11:23.867 --> 00:11:26.873
Of course, the chances
are slim for you as well,

00:11:26.906 --> 00:11:30.146
but if by some miracle you
find yourself resurrected,

00:11:30.179 --> 00:11:35.122
I would like for you to help
Dino as if you were helping me."

00:11:35.156 --> 00:11:37.226
"By the time you read
this, I believe either

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.734
the Dark King or Dino himself
will have struck me down.

00:11:40.767 --> 00:11:42.203
If I am no more,

00:11:42.237 --> 00:11:45.242
my hope is that you'll take on
what was meant to be my duty."

00:11:45.276 --> 00:11:48.550
Master Baran was prepared to
sacrifice himself for you -

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:49.752
and I am as well.

00:11:49.786 --> 00:11:52.323
It would be my
honor to serve you.

00:11:52.792 --> 00:11:54.829
Wow, Dad...

00:11:56.432 --> 00:12:00.574
Baran: "Larhart, I raised
you from a child to a man,

00:12:00.607 --> 00:12:02.978
and we've fought
by each other's side.

00:12:03.012 --> 00:12:06.586
I know all too well of the
hate you harbor for the humans.

00:12:06.619 --> 00:12:08.523
And yet, in spite
of what I know,

00:12:08.556 --> 00:12:10.493
I will ask you all the same...

00:12:10.528 --> 00:12:13.399
Should Dino decide he wishes
to protect the humans,

00:12:13.433 --> 00:12:16.606
please accept his wishes
and obey his commands.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.545
Tell him to fight
with all his heart."

00:12:19.578 --> 00:12:21.616
I believe that boy
has the power to

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:24.387
change the nature
of humanity itself.

00:12:24.421 --> 00:12:26.158
This is my final request,

00:12:26.191 --> 00:12:28.362
but I want the
decision to be yours.

00:12:28.396 --> 00:12:32.638
Whichever you choose,
I'm glad to have known you.

00:12:32.671 --> 00:12:34.775
Baran: You are
like a son to me.

00:12:34.809 --> 00:12:38.984
Until we meet again in
the afterlife. Farewell.

00:13:08.944 --> 00:13:10.748
Larhart: You know...

00:13:10.781 --> 00:13:12.818
He was like a father to me.

00:13:12.851 --> 00:13:14.254
Dai: Thank you.

00:13:15.023 --> 00:13:16.391
For sharing all that.

00:13:16.425 --> 00:13:18.964
I guess in a way, that
makes us brothers, huh?

00:13:18.997 --> 00:13:20.601
Well, all right then.

00:13:20.634 --> 00:13:22.872
Master Dino...

00:13:22.905 --> 00:13:25.811
If you want an order, then
here's one for you, Larhart:

00:13:25.845 --> 00:13:27.247
Stick with Popp and Maam,

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.819
and help them take down this
evil specter while we're gone.

00:13:29.853 --> 00:13:31.088
Yes, sir.

00:13:31.121 --> 00:13:34.562
Also... I, uh... I've got
another request to make.

00:13:34.595 --> 00:13:38.870
Dai: Please... don't call me
Dino anymore. Call me Dai.

00:13:38.903 --> 00:13:40.774
I know Dad gave
me the other name,

00:13:40.808 --> 00:13:42.778
but hearing it
is too painful.

00:13:42.812 --> 00:13:45.149
It brings up bad
memories of him.

00:13:46.352 --> 00:13:47.822
Of course, I understand.

00:13:47.855 --> 00:13:50.026
Master Dai,
the Hero, it is.

00:13:50.059 --> 00:13:52.799
Let's go. It's time to put
and end to this, you guys.

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:53.901
Right!

00:13:53.934 --> 00:13:55.369
Dai: Popp, Maam...

00:13:55.403 --> 00:13:58.108
This time, I'm actually
leaving things to you.

00:13:58.142 --> 00:14:00.748
I'll see you after
I defeat King Vearn.

00:14:00.781 --> 00:14:02.851
Yeah! Now that's
the spirit, buddy.

00:14:02.885 --> 00:14:04.856
Don't worry.
We won't mess up again.

00:14:04.889 --> 00:14:06.491
Just get the job done.

00:14:06.526 --> 00:14:09.932
Larhart: You certainly don't
inspire much confidence.

00:14:09.966 --> 00:14:11.469
I'll be giving
the orders now -

00:14:11.503 --> 00:14:14.775
and here's the first one:
stay out of my way.

00:14:14.809 --> 00:14:17.180
Another sparkling
personality to deal with.

00:14:17.213 --> 00:14:19.752
Cut him some slack.
He did come to our rescue.

00:14:19.786 --> 00:14:22.090
Who knows? This just
might work out.

00:14:22.959 --> 00:14:24.327
Mystvearn [thought]:
Extraordinary.

00:14:24.361 --> 00:14:27.802
I may very well have to
consider the possibility...

00:14:27.835 --> 00:14:31.174
of fighting these
three at full strength.

00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:35.182
Dai [thought] : It's all
come down to this.

00:14:35.216 --> 00:14:36.953
My true enemy lies ahead.

00:14:36.987 --> 00:14:39.191
I wouldn't have gotten this
far without my friends.

00:14:39.224 --> 00:14:41.095
They've all been
through so much...

00:14:41.128 --> 00:14:43.065
putting everything
they had on the line...

00:14:43.099 --> 00:14:45.704
Thanks to them, I'm as
ready as I'll ever be.

00:14:45.737 --> 00:14:47.608
I've conserved
all of my power...

00:14:47.641 --> 00:14:50.446
And I'm gonna hit King Vearn
with everything I've got.

00:14:50.479 --> 00:14:53.452
I'll fight like a Dragon
Knight and hold nothing back.

00:14:53.485 --> 00:14:55.423
No matter how
powerful my enemy is,

00:14:55.456 --> 00:14:58.496
I won't give up until
I've defeated him.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:14:59.932
Look. There it is.

00:15:10.554 --> 00:15:13.694
Dai: So this is...
the Tower of Supremacy.

00:15:13.727 --> 00:15:16.198
Vearn: Quite correct.

00:15:16.231 --> 00:15:19.605
Hurry on up, Dai.
I've been waiting.

00:15:19.638 --> 00:15:23.245
And as it happens, I've
also just run out of wine.

00:15:24.214 --> 00:15:26.520
I know that voice.
It's Dark King...

00:15:26.553 --> 00:15:27.588
Vearn.

00:15:27.621 --> 00:15:30.360
Vearn: I won't bother to
say anything haughty like,

00:15:30.393 --> 00:15:34.034
"Well done making it this far,
young Hero. How unexpected."

00:15:34.068 --> 00:15:35.470
Truth be told, Dai,

00:15:35.504 --> 00:15:39.044
nearly everything about you
has exceeded my expectations.

00:15:39.077 --> 00:15:42.985
From your powers,
to your numerous close calls...

00:15:43.019 --> 00:15:45.658
Vearn: Your friends are
holding off Mystvearn

00:15:45.691 --> 00:15:47.493
and Killvearn at the moment,

00:15:47.528 --> 00:15:51.869
so I find myself in a truly
unprecedented situation.

00:15:51.903 --> 00:15:54.809
You could say I've been
left to fend for myself.

00:15:54.843 --> 00:15:56.078
But nevertheless...

00:15:56.112 --> 00:16:00.319
I accept your challenge.
Now come and face me.

00:16:00.352 --> 00:16:02.658
Ascend the Tower of Supremacy

00:16:02.691 --> 00:16:06.398
and you will find the
entrance to my inner sanctum.

00:16:06.432 --> 00:16:10.172
You have my word, I'll give
you a fitting welcome.

00:16:15.316 --> 00:16:17.020
Dai: The stairs
are over there.

00:16:17.053 --> 00:16:20.259
There could be more traps.
So be careful, you guys.

00:16:29.712 --> 00:16:32.819
Vearn: You're exceeding even
more of my expectations.

00:16:32.852 --> 00:16:35.155
I thought you'd come alone.

00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:37.393
I recognize that
young woman...

00:16:37.427 --> 00:16:41.569
Yes, that's right. She's the
princess of Papnica Kingdom.

00:16:41.602 --> 00:16:44.374
Well, I suppose
it's all the same to me.

00:16:44.408 --> 00:16:46.312
You can bring along
whomever you want.

00:16:46.345 --> 00:16:49.384
But it seems to me as if
Dragon Knights have a habit of

00:16:49.417 --> 00:16:53.626
bringing misfortune upon the
women who keep their company.

00:16:54.962 --> 00:16:56.131
Vearn: [chuckling]

00:16:56.164 --> 00:16:59.672
Not that there's any
escaping misfortune now.

00:16:59.706 --> 00:17:01.776
[laughing]

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:02.711
You okay?

00:17:12.598 --> 00:17:15.069
What is it, Dai?
What are you waiting for?

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.446
Dai: Leona, I think you
should take this back for now.

00:17:20.479 --> 00:17:23.119
his knife you gave me,
you said it's the last one

00:17:23.152 --> 00:17:24.989
in the Papnica royal
family, didn't you?

00:17:25.022 --> 00:17:26.859
It was always
supposed to be yours.

00:17:26.893 --> 00:17:28.362
Anyhow, I just
wanted to, uh...

00:17:28.396 --> 00:17:30.768
Leona: You need to get a grip.
What's up with you?

00:17:30.801 --> 00:17:33.072
Don't let what Vearn
said get under your skin.

00:17:33.105 --> 00:17:34.509
That's what he wants.

00:17:34.542 --> 00:17:36.847
Leona: He's only toying with
you to try and throw you off.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.449
Trust me, I'll be fine.

00:17:38.482 --> 00:17:40.820
Dai: It's not that.
I know what he's doing.

00:17:41.556 --> 00:17:42.858
Then... Then why?

00:17:42.891 --> 00:17:44.260
Don't worry.

00:17:44.294 --> 00:17:46.766
I'm not giving it back because
I'm trying to say goodbye.

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:48.302
Just the opposite.

00:17:48.336 --> 00:17:49.672
Leona [thought]:
The opposite?

00:17:49.706 --> 00:17:51.976
Dai: Right now, aside
from Master's Feathers,

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.580
you're basically unarmed.

00:17:53.613 --> 00:17:56.151
Once we get up there
and I face King Vearn,

00:17:56.184 --> 00:17:58.289
I'll be using my Draconic
Aura at full strength,

00:17:58.322 --> 00:17:59.859
and this knife can't take it.

00:17:59.893 --> 00:18:01.729
I don't want it destroyed.

00:18:01.763 --> 00:18:03.098
But you can use it.

00:18:03.132 --> 00:18:04.601
So I figure if
you're carrying it,

00:18:04.635 --> 00:18:07.608
at least you'll have a weapon
if things go south, right?

00:18:07.641 --> 00:18:08.677
"If things go south..."

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:11.415
Are you saying I
should look after myself?

00:18:11.448 --> 00:18:12.951
This is the Dark King
we're fighting.

00:18:12.985 --> 00:18:16.058
I can't guarantee that I'll be
able to protect you from him -

00:18:16.091 --> 00:18:17.928
let alone take him down.

00:18:17.961 --> 00:18:19.063
That's why...

00:18:19.097 --> 00:18:20.767
I want you to
fight along with me.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.038
If you're going to face
this kind of danger,

00:18:23.072 --> 00:18:24.842
face it by my side.

00:18:26.946 --> 00:18:29.017
Leona: [sniffling]

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:30.854
Maybe that's
asking too much.

00:18:30.887 --> 00:18:32.356
No, it's not.

00:18:35.864 --> 00:18:37.802
Leona: That's not it.

00:18:37.835 --> 00:18:40.305
It's what I wanted to hear.

00:18:53.065 --> 00:18:54.434
Dai: Now that I think of it,

00:18:54.468 --> 00:18:57.473
this is kind of like the
first time we met, isn't it?

00:18:58.844 --> 00:19:00.781
Yeah, just like old times.

00:19:00.814 --> 00:19:01.849
Only back then,

00:19:01.882 --> 00:19:03.987
I was the one adjusting
this scabbard to fit you.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.356
But you're right.

00:19:05.389 --> 00:19:07.260
That day on Dermline Island,
it was exactly like this.

00:19:07.294 --> 00:19:08.730
The three of us together.

00:19:08.763 --> 00:19:10.633
Me and you and Gomechan.

00:19:18.449 --> 00:19:21.388
You could barely hold your own
against a single Scorpion,

00:19:21.422 --> 00:19:23.893
and now you're about to
face the Dark King himself.

00:19:23.926 --> 00:19:25.062
That's a pretty huge journey.

00:19:25.095 --> 00:19:26.231
Dai: Guess so.

00:19:26.264 --> 00:19:28.503
I still have nightmares
about that Scorpion.

00:19:28.536 --> 00:19:31.509
My heart was pounding
like it was gonna explode!

00:19:31.542 --> 00:19:35.316
We were just going into a cave
I'd been a thousand times...

00:19:35.349 --> 00:19:37.921
And how about now?
Is your heart pounding again?

00:19:37.955 --> 00:19:39.659
Dai: I'm not really sure.

00:19:39.692 --> 00:19:41.361
I mean, my heart's
definitely pounding...

00:19:41.394 --> 00:19:43.065
I don't know how
to put it into words,

00:19:43.098 --> 00:19:45.770
but something feels
different this time.

00:19:46.906 --> 00:19:49.678
My heart isn't pounding like
it was with the Scorpion.

00:19:49.712 --> 00:19:52.951
If I'm being honest, it
mostly just feels heavy.

00:19:56.391 --> 00:19:58.228
Dai: It's not
like it was before.

00:19:58.261 --> 00:20:00.266
The journey's
coming to an end.

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:01.736
Leona [thought]:
He's really grown up.

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:04.942
The adventurous young
boy's almost faded away.

00:20:04.975 --> 00:20:08.883
He's still tiny, but there's
no question that he's the Hero.

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:12.157
He's carrying the future
of every human being.

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:13.560
That responsibility must be

00:20:13.593 --> 00:20:15.864
such a terrible weight
on his shoulders.

00:20:15.897 --> 00:20:18.168
I have to help him lift it.

00:20:18.202 --> 00:20:19.805
And even if the
weight is too much,

00:20:19.839 --> 00:20:21.776
even if I can't help
him win the fight,

00:20:21.809 --> 00:20:25.183
I still have to try
to ease his burden.

00:20:25.216 --> 00:20:26.886
Someday, when all
these battles are over,

00:20:26.919 --> 00:20:29.759
Dai will travel the world
with a light heart again.

00:20:29.792 --> 00:20:31.529
I'll make sure of it.

00:20:33.298 --> 00:20:38.910
[muffled cries]

00:20:43.084 --> 00:20:44.320
[worried chirp]

00:20:46.759 --> 00:20:49.766
[muffled cries]

00:20:49.799 --> 00:20:50.834
Leona!

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:53.739
Dai, help!

00:20:54.842 --> 00:20:56.545
Hang on, I'm coming!

00:21:01.387 --> 00:21:02.657
Vearn [thought]: Remarkable...

00:21:02.691 --> 00:21:04.695
An interesting
turn of events.

00:21:04.728 --> 00:21:08.335
I never anticipated that it
would act of its own free will,

00:21:08.369 --> 00:21:09.973
but if it's captured
our interlopers

00:21:10.006 --> 00:21:11.208
without my prompting,

00:21:11.241 --> 00:21:12.845
then it only
stands to reason...

00:21:12.878 --> 00:21:14.615
It's truly alive.

00:21:14.648 --> 00:21:16.285
Dai [thought]: What
just grabbed Leona...

00:21:16.318 --> 00:21:17.754
Some kind of monster?

00:21:17.788 --> 00:21:21.060
I knew I had that bad
feeling for a reason.

00:21:28.876 --> 00:21:29.979
Where'd she go?

00:21:30.012 --> 00:21:31.447
Leona: Up here...

00:21:34.488 --> 00:21:36.024
Help me, Dai! Hurry!

00:21:36.057 --> 00:21:37.193
Leona!

00:21:37.226 --> 00:21:40.567
[charging chirp]

00:21:53.225 --> 00:21:54.995
[terrified chirp]

00:21:56.498 --> 00:21:58.603
Wh-What is that thing?

00:22:01.174 --> 00:22:03.913
Dai: Is... Is it alive?!

00:23:37.534 --> 00:23:39.237
Narrator: Dai and Leona
may have reached

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:40.373
the Tower of Supremacy,

00:23:40.406 --> 00:23:41.943
but before they can
face the Dark King,

00:23:41.976 --> 00:23:44.046
Dai must free the princess
from the clutches of

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.220
a mysterious beast who dwells
at the heart of Vearn Palace.

00:23:47.253 --> 00:23:50.527
Facing a threat whose power
takes even Vearn by surprise,

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.429
Dai's plan to conserve
his strength for

00:23:52.463 --> 00:23:54.467
the final battle
falls into jeopardy.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.204
With new adversaries closing in,

00:23:56.238 --> 00:23:57.908
will our heroes find
a way to escape?

00:23:57.941 --> 00:23:59.612
Find out on
the next episode of

00:23:59.645 --> 00:24:01.715
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:01.749 --> 00:24:04.053
"Rise, Knight of Destiny".
