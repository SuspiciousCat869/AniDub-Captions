WEBVTT

00:01:53.126 --> 00:01:54.228
Sizzle!

00:02:16.406 --> 00:02:17.776
Sigma: How resilient...

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:20.213
May I ask you something, Mage?

00:02:21.082 --> 00:02:22.618
Popp: Go ahead.

00:02:22.652 --> 00:02:24.956
Sigma: Are you
really a mere human?

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.425
If I'm not mistaken,

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.800
only a Darkling should be able
to withstand that kind of force.

00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:31.603
Well, I'm almost flattered...

00:02:31.637 --> 00:02:34.710
but there's nothing
special about me.

00:02:34.743 --> 00:02:39.452
I'm just a human. A cowardly,
small, ordinary human.

00:02:39.485 --> 00:02:40.988
Sigma: People who
say such things

00:02:41.021 --> 00:02:43.628
are often the
most dangerous...

00:02:43.661 --> 00:02:46.867
So I'm not going
to hold anything back.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.908
Maam [thought]:
Hang on, Popp...

00:02:52.177 --> 00:02:54.850
You know, you don't fool me.

00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:56.085
You may not admit it,

00:02:56.118 --> 00:02:58.591
but I can sense how much
of a threat you are.

00:02:58.624 --> 00:03:01.429
I could feel it from
the moment this fight began.

00:03:01.463 --> 00:03:04.335
Besides, it's obvious:
You're up to something.

00:03:04.368 --> 00:03:05.839
Why else would you
keep using magic

00:03:05.872 --> 00:03:08.978
when you know that I'll
deflect whatever you conjure?

00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:11.583
It's clearly some
kind of tactic...

00:03:11.617 --> 00:03:15.290
You're hoping I'll let
my guard down... aren't you?

00:03:15.825 --> 00:03:17.161
[impressed chuckle]

00:03:17.194 --> 00:03:19.064
Popp: All right, you got me.

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:20.200
Y'know, you're
the first enemy

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:22.271
I've ever faced
who's figured it out.

00:03:22.304 --> 00:03:23.607
Usually whoever I'm fighting

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.511
just assumes that
I'm some scrub-

00:03:25.544 --> 00:03:27.214
not someone to take seriously.

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:28.551
And it's given me a chance

00:03:28.584 --> 00:03:30.822
to catch them
off-guard, every time.

00:03:30.855 --> 00:03:32.258
[chuckling]

00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:34.897
Well, not this time.
So that's your plan-

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.805
using lesser spells to
find an opening in my defenses?

00:03:38.838 --> 00:03:40.374
It won't work.

00:03:40.407 --> 00:03:42.713
We both know there's
only one spell you have

00:03:42.746 --> 00:03:44.716
that can defeat me...

00:03:45.284 --> 00:03:47.121
The Medroa incantation.

00:03:47.154 --> 00:03:49.693
Try using that
and see how you fare.

00:03:49.726 --> 00:03:50.227
Popp: [scoffing]

00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:51.530
I'm not that stupid.

00:03:51.563 --> 00:03:54.234
If I cast Medroa and
you bounce it back at me,

00:03:54.268 --> 00:03:56.238
then this fight
will really be over.

00:03:57.074 --> 00:03:58.409
You don't fool me, either.

00:03:58.443 --> 00:04:01.348
And I'm not giving you
what you want so easily!

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.155
A Boom spell? Please...

00:04:04.188 --> 00:04:05.390
How futile.

00:04:05.423 --> 00:04:07.796
This is no match for
the Mirror of Shahal.

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.033
Popp [thought]: Now counter
and cancel it out...

00:04:11.002 --> 00:04:12.370
Boom!

00:04:14.843 --> 00:04:19.384
That's step one. Here we go
- Black Rod... Extend!

00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:30.508
[roaring]

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.963
Okay, rod. Transform
into bident mode!

00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:49.513
Popp [thought]: That did it.

00:04:49.546 --> 00:04:52.852
I got the mirror off, and now
he's not going anywhere.

00:04:52.885 --> 00:04:54.556
This is it, Sigma.

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:02.238
What are you so smug about?

00:05:02.271 --> 00:05:03.841
I said this is it!

00:05:03.874 --> 00:05:06.346
You're not even
going to try to move?

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:08.984
You've exceeded my
expectations here, Popp.

00:05:09.018 --> 00:05:10.320
I'll give you that.

00:05:10.354 --> 00:05:12.726
I knew you had an
ace up your sleeve,

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:15.063
but I never thought
it would be so powerful,

00:05:15.096 --> 00:05:16.833
and to gamble
your fate on it...

00:05:16.867 --> 00:05:20.708
That was very brave.
And also a waste.

00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:23.681
You would have had me if
you'd pinned the other arm...

00:05:23.714 --> 00:05:25.885
But I suppose
you're only human.

00:05:35.871 --> 00:05:36.940
Sigma: My turn.

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:40.079
Lightning Buster!

00:05:49.465 --> 00:05:51.368
Popp: [pained cry]

00:05:52.506 --> 00:05:53.974
That's right, you
weren't the only one

00:05:54.008 --> 00:05:57.548
who had an ace up their
sleeve, you foolish boy.

00:05:57.582 --> 00:05:59.887
The Lightning Buster
in my right arm fires a blast

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.225
that's just as powerful
as a Kaboom spell.

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:04.996
Although, like
Hym's Heat Knuckle,

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:08.136
it requires physical
contact to be effective.

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:11.109
You're beyond help now.

00:06:11.142 --> 00:06:13.313
This is where we part ways.

00:06:13.346 --> 00:06:14.448
I hope you'll forgive me

00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:16.653
for carrying on
to the next battle...

00:06:16.686 --> 00:06:19.025
without paying
the proper respects...

00:06:19.058 --> 00:06:20.995
Worthy adversary.

00:06:30.681 --> 00:06:33.052
Impossible. How are
you still alive?

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.894
Sigma: Wait,
that's... Fullheal!

00:06:36.927 --> 00:06:39.398
Well, now I see how
you've been so resilient-

00:06:39.431 --> 00:06:40.968
you must have been
healing yourself

00:06:41.002 --> 00:06:43.039
this whole time, but how?

00:06:43.072 --> 00:06:48.551
No... Could it really be...
Are you a Sage?

00:06:48.584 --> 00:06:51.188
Popp: No, I'm not.
I'm no Sage.

00:06:51.221 --> 00:06:53.092
I've got an even better title.

00:06:57.636 --> 00:07:00.173
Nah. I ain't no Sage, kid.

00:07:00.207 --> 00:07:01.943
Uh, what are you
talking about?

00:07:01.977 --> 00:07:04.682
Why not? I mean, you can
use all sorts of spells-

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:07.956
everything from attack-type
to healing-type, right?

00:07:07.989 --> 00:07:10.661
Doesn't that by
definition make you a Sage?

00:07:10.694 --> 00:07:13.499
I'm well aware of the
definitions, you knucklehead.

00:07:13.534 --> 00:07:16.339
I just don't like the title.
It sounds so pompous;

00:07:16.372 --> 00:07:18.443
doesn't fit my style at all.

00:07:18.476 --> 00:07:21.315
Matoriv: It lacks the pizzaz.
Know what I mean?

00:07:21.348 --> 00:07:23.286
[awkward chuckle]

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.454
Matoriv: That's
the whole reason

00:07:24.488 --> 00:07:26.392
I came up with
the title I've got.

00:07:26.426 --> 00:07:28.664
I wanted something
everybody would fear

00:07:28.697 --> 00:07:29.832
the moment they heard it...

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:31.770
Something that'd
let them all know...

00:07:31.803 --> 00:07:35.143
that I'm the world's
most powerful spell-caster.

00:07:35.176 --> 00:07:36.980
Something like...

00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:41.189
Popp: The Grand Sorcerer.

00:07:41.222 --> 00:07:42.290
W-What?!

00:07:42.324 --> 00:07:44.161
Popp: You heard me.

00:07:44.194 --> 00:07:47.568
If you call me anything,
then you better call me...

00:07:47.602 --> 00:07:49.171
the Grand Sorcerer.

00:07:50.841 --> 00:07:53.446
Sigma: Popp,
the Grand Sorcerer.

00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:54.716
[chuckling]

00:07:54.749 --> 00:07:57.454
Honestly, that doesn't
seem too far off the mark.

00:07:57.487 --> 00:08:00.160
Tell me, when did you
learn the Fullheal?

00:08:00.193 --> 00:08:01.830
Just about a minute ago.

00:08:01.863 --> 00:08:02.999
You lie.

00:08:03.032 --> 00:08:04.635
My mentor's thorough.

00:08:04.669 --> 00:08:07.842
He already made me bind with
almost every spell there is.

00:08:07.875 --> 00:08:09.011
For some reason,

00:08:09.044 --> 00:08:11.950
something just clicked and
I was able to use this one.

00:08:11.984 --> 00:08:14.589
For what it's worth,
I'm a little surprised myself-

00:08:14.623 --> 00:08:15.991
gaining a new power

00:08:16.025 --> 00:08:19.532
right after one of my lowest
moments feels pretty ironic.

00:08:19.565 --> 00:08:21.335
Popp: It's not
like I earned it.

00:08:21.368 --> 00:08:23.139
I've never...

00:08:23.173 --> 00:08:27.113
I don't think I've ever
been more ashamed of myself.

00:08:27.147 --> 00:08:30.788
Only your soul could
have awakened such an ability.

00:08:30.821 --> 00:08:35.029
The spirit is capable of pushing
the body beyond its limits.

00:08:35.063 --> 00:08:37.635
That's what
I've always believed.

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:40.975
The soul that Lord Hadlar was
kind enough to grant me...

00:08:41.008 --> 00:08:43.145
is my most
cherished possession.

00:08:44.716 --> 00:08:46.285
Sigma: However...

00:08:46.319 --> 00:08:47.788
In your case,
unfortunately,

00:08:47.822 --> 00:08:50.226
you haven't gained
any real advantage.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.734
All healing will do is drag
this fight out longer...

00:08:53.767 --> 00:08:56.172
Ironically, that's
all the better for me,

00:08:56.205 --> 00:08:57.742
since my goal is to buy time

00:08:57.775 --> 00:09:00.848
while Lord Hadlar
has his duel with Dai.

00:09:00.882 --> 00:09:04.154
Popp: Well,
I wouldn't... be so sure.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.562
Sigma: Medroa...

00:09:07.595 --> 00:09:10.466
You do realize that
I won't just stand here

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.470
and get hit by
that, don't you?

00:09:12.505 --> 00:09:13.541
[chuckle]

00:09:13.574 --> 00:09:15.578
Wouldn't be much
of a fight if you did.

00:09:15.611 --> 00:09:17.214
You said it
yourself, tough guy.

00:09:17.247 --> 00:09:18.583
There's only
one spell I know

00:09:18.617 --> 00:09:21.121
that can defeat you,
and it's this.

00:09:22.424 --> 00:09:25.831
Well here we go, Sigma.
All or nothing.

00:09:26.833 --> 00:09:29.673
Popp: I respect your
loyalty to Hadlar...

00:09:29.706 --> 00:09:31.409
I respect it enough to know

00:09:31.442 --> 00:09:34.048
I have to match it
with loyalty of my own.

00:09:34.081 --> 00:09:36.953
I need to get back
to Dai as soon as I can.

00:09:36.987 --> 00:09:41.228
And to do that... I'll have
to take you out first!

00:09:42.965 --> 00:09:45.437
Sigma: I could keep
trying to buy time...

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:46.740
but you've gained my interest,

00:09:46.773 --> 00:09:49.779
and I can't turn
down a challenge.

00:09:49.812 --> 00:09:51.215
So bring it on...

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:53.820
Grand Sorcerer!

00:09:56.292 --> 00:09:59.030
[roaring]

00:10:03.372 --> 00:10:04.742
You're sluggish.

00:10:04.776 --> 00:10:07.549
If this is the best you can
do, you should just give up.

00:10:07.582 --> 00:10:09.986
At this rate,
you'll never even hit me.

00:10:10.019 --> 00:10:10.888
Bang!

00:10:11.723 --> 00:10:13.159
This game is mine.

00:10:13.193 --> 00:10:17.401
It seems the goddess of victory
does not smile upon you today.

00:10:17.434 --> 00:10:18.703
Popp: [chuckling]

00:10:18.737 --> 00:10:20.742
Of course not. Because
I have a different goddess-

00:10:20.775 --> 00:10:22.845
and she never smiles on me.

00:10:23.547 --> 00:10:25.584
She slaps me in the face...

00:10:25.617 --> 00:10:27.755
Here, let me give
you an example.

00:10:27.788 --> 00:10:28.790
Sigma: Too slow!

00:10:28.824 --> 00:10:30.861
Actually, you're too slow.

00:10:30.895 --> 00:10:32.030
Popp: Now your own weapon

00:10:32.064 --> 00:10:34.802
will be your ticket
to the afterlife!

00:10:36.907 --> 00:10:40.280
I beg to differ. I won't
be going anywhere.

00:10:40.313 --> 00:10:43.821
No, this Medroa will
be taking you instead.

00:10:43.854 --> 00:10:45.657
Get out of there!

00:10:53.006 --> 00:10:55.677
No, Popp!

00:11:05.062 --> 00:11:07.033
It seems you've
arrived too late.

00:11:07.066 --> 00:11:09.371
Sigma: He'll be annihilated
any moment now.

00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:17.387
Sigma: It can't be...

00:11:17.421 --> 00:11:19.959
No one survives
a Medroa spell!

00:11:22.463 --> 00:11:26.839
And it looks like I win...
the game of deception.

00:11:27.942 --> 00:11:29.377
Medroa!

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:13.633
Well, well. Then that first
spell you cast... wasn't Medroa.

00:12:13.667 --> 00:12:15.905
Yeah. I adjusted
my Magic Power

00:12:15.938 --> 00:12:19.011
and casted a Sizzle spell
disguised to look like it.

00:12:19.044 --> 00:12:20.380
I figured that the only way

00:12:20.413 --> 00:12:22.985
I was going to catch
you off guard was if...

00:12:23.018 --> 00:12:26.258
I let myself get hit
so you'd think you won.

00:12:26.291 --> 00:12:30.768
Nicely played. A satisfying
fight, nonetheless.

00:12:30.801 --> 00:12:34.307
I doubt Lord Hadlar would
blame me for losing it.

00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:38.684
I shall never
forget your name...

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:40.988
The Grand Sorcerer... Popp.

00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:44.428
And same to you,
Sigma the Knight.

00:12:44.461 --> 00:12:45.798
If you ever get the chance,

00:12:45.831 --> 00:12:48.302
give my regards to
this goddess who slaps you.

00:12:48.336 --> 00:12:51.041
She sounds like a...
fearsome being.

00:12:52.812 --> 00:12:53.914
See that big flash

00:12:53.947 --> 00:12:55.851
that just came off
the top of Vearn Palace?

00:12:55.884 --> 00:12:57.120
Crocodine: Indeed.

00:12:57.153 --> 00:12:59.693
That's the light from
Popp's Medroa incantation.

00:12:59.726 --> 00:13:01.863
The Disciples of Avan
are fighting well!

00:13:01.897 --> 00:13:04.902
You don't say. So that's
what Medroa looks like.

00:13:04.935 --> 00:13:06.606
We'd better not
let them down now.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.442
My thoughts exactly.

00:13:08.475 --> 00:13:11.381
Howling Inferno!

00:13:13.286 --> 00:13:15.725
So why'd you
come to help, anyway?

00:13:15.758 --> 00:13:18.495
Do you really not
have any faith in me?

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:21.468
That's not it
at all, I- uh...

00:13:21.502 --> 00:13:22.938
Popp: Maam, we should talk...

00:13:22.972 --> 00:13:24.676
I know there's
a lot going on,

00:13:24.709 --> 00:13:27.046
but there's something
I need to tell you.

00:13:28.583 --> 00:13:30.220
Popp: I, uh...

00:13:30.253 --> 00:13:32.023
I really love you.

00:13:46.586 --> 00:13:48.690
Popp: [laughing]

00:13:48.724 --> 00:13:51.663
Finally. I finally
say it to your face,

00:13:51.696 --> 00:13:53.499
and the right way this time.

00:13:54.869 --> 00:13:56.238
When I first said it,

00:13:56.272 --> 00:13:59.011
everything was
just such a mess...

00:13:59.044 --> 00:14:02.116
It was one of the worst
moments of my life.

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:04.054
It's okay, Popp. I just...

00:14:04.087 --> 00:14:05.558
Popp: Either way,
if you're wondering why

00:14:05.591 --> 00:14:08.162
I'm choosing to tell
you again, here and now...

00:14:08.195 --> 00:14:09.866
I wanted to say it properly,

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.470
before we head into
the final battle.

00:14:12.505 --> 00:14:16.445
I know I made it...
weird for you, and I'm sorry.

00:14:16.479 --> 00:14:18.650
I guess that's all.

00:14:18.684 --> 00:14:21.154
Popp: Anyway.
We should get going.

00:14:22.625 --> 00:14:24.060
Hold on.

00:14:25.162 --> 00:14:27.133
I said hold on, you big idiot!

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:30.172
D-Don't you...

00:14:30.206 --> 00:14:32.911
Don't you want to
hear how I feel about you?

00:14:32.945 --> 00:14:34.649
You can't say
your piece like that

00:14:34.682 --> 00:14:36.919
and run off before
I get to respond.

00:14:36.953 --> 00:14:39.290
That's what makes things
weird. It's not fair.

00:14:39.324 --> 00:14:42.330
And there you go again,
saying it like it is.

00:14:42.363 --> 00:14:45.570
Subtlety isn't exactly
your strongest quality, is it?

00:14:45.604 --> 00:14:48.475
Why'd I have to go
and fall in love with you?

00:14:53.052 --> 00:14:54.020
Popp: You're right, Maam.

00:14:54.053 --> 00:14:55.757
It isn't fair.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:56.959
But you know me-

00:14:56.993 --> 00:14:59.431
I've always been a bit
of a coward, haven't I?

00:14:59.464 --> 00:15:02.805
And right now,
I'm completely terrified.

00:15:02.838 --> 00:15:04.909
Like, maybe you're
not interested in me,

00:15:04.942 --> 00:15:07.313
or maybe you're
really in love with Hyunckel

00:15:07.347 --> 00:15:09.685
and I'm making
a fool of myself...

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.090
I'm actually shaking.

00:15:12.123 --> 00:15:14.295
Maam [thought]: Popp...

00:15:14.328 --> 00:15:16.767
Popp: Even back
with the Kaglimmer spell.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.004
It wasn't getting
wounded or even dying

00:15:19.038 --> 00:15:20.908
that really frightened me.

00:15:20.941 --> 00:15:23.747
But if I failed the party
and got left behind...

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.619
I couldn't think
of anything worse.

00:15:26.653 --> 00:15:30.326
Popp: The truth is, if I didn't
have you or Dai by my side...

00:15:30.359 --> 00:15:32.631
I'd... I'd just be worthless.

00:15:32.664 --> 00:15:35.538
When my Insignia wouldn't
glow, I should've told you.

00:15:35.571 --> 00:15:36.673
I should have just...

00:15:36.706 --> 00:15:40.013
come out and said it and
asked you guys for some help.

00:15:40.046 --> 00:15:42.216
But I was too scared.

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:44.522
So I didn't say anything.

00:15:44.556 --> 00:15:45.891
What if one of you thought

00:15:45.924 --> 00:15:48.362
that I wasn't worthy
to be part of the group?

00:15:48.396 --> 00:15:51.235
It was that fear
that kept me silent.

00:15:51.268 --> 00:15:52.938
Popp: Now that
I think about it,

00:15:52.971 --> 00:15:55.611
I bet it was Master Avan
who kept it from glowing.

00:15:55.644 --> 00:15:56.846
He was always saying,

00:15:56.879 --> 00:16:00.153
"I won't have any student of
mine chickening out like that."

00:16:00.186 --> 00:16:02.023
And I still run away...

00:16:02.056 --> 00:16:03.627
Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.497
I shouldn't have done that.

00:16:05.531 --> 00:16:07.868
I should just accept
whatever's coming my way,

00:16:07.902 --> 00:16:10.339
or I'll never be
able to face Merle.

00:16:10.373 --> 00:16:14.414
Besides, I'm supposed to be the
Disciple of Courage, aren't I?

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:18.356
Popp: You always
do this to me, y'know?

00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:20.326
It's true. Anytime
I end up going astray,

00:16:20.359 --> 00:16:22.229
You can always
slap me out of it,

00:16:22.263 --> 00:16:24.134
and put me back
on the right path...

00:16:24.168 --> 00:16:26.071
Even if I whine about it.

00:16:26.104 --> 00:16:27.908
And, that's why...

00:16:27.941 --> 00:16:29.979
That's why...

00:16:30.012 --> 00:16:31.482
Popp: I dunno.

00:16:31.516 --> 00:16:34.320
It's a lot more
than that too, but...

00:16:36.157 --> 00:16:39.899
I... I just...

00:16:39.933 --> 00:16:41.502
Love you.

00:16:47.948 --> 00:16:48.951
I'll shut up now.

00:16:48.984 --> 00:16:50.120
But, anyhow.

00:16:50.153 --> 00:16:52.691
I was wondering,
how do you feel about me?

00:16:54.427 --> 00:16:56.232
How I feel...

00:16:56.265 --> 00:16:58.101
How I feel about you?

00:17:00.072 --> 00:17:01.609
I love you.

00:17:01.643 --> 00:17:02.779
Very much.

00:17:02.812 --> 00:17:04.214
Popp: Really? You do?

00:17:04.247 --> 00:17:05.551
But, no. Wait a second.

00:17:05.584 --> 00:17:07.487
I thought you were
in love with Hyunckel?

00:17:07.521 --> 00:17:09.825
Well, yeah. Of course
I love Hyunckel.

00:17:09.858 --> 00:17:10.928
He's my friend.

00:17:10.961 --> 00:17:12.330
He's strong, but alone.

00:17:12.363 --> 00:17:14.969
Sometimes I really
worry about him...

00:17:15.002 --> 00:17:16.205
Maam: But the thing is,

00:17:16.238 --> 00:17:17.875
I worry about you too, Popp.

00:17:17.908 --> 00:17:19.077
You're like my little brother.

00:17:19.111 --> 00:17:21.181
I'm always afraid if I
let you out of my sight,

00:17:21.215 --> 00:17:23.219
you'll fall
face-first into trouble.

00:17:23.252 --> 00:17:26.225
I care about you both, a lot.

00:17:26.258 --> 00:17:28.329
Popp [thought]: A little
brother? Please, kill me.

00:17:28.362 --> 00:17:31.368
The first time you said that
you were in love with me, I...

00:17:31.401 --> 00:17:33.472
I really didn't
know how to feel.

00:17:33.507 --> 00:17:36.244
But now, I'm
grateful you said it.

00:17:36.278 --> 00:17:39.652
Only, I'm not ready to
give you an answer yet.

00:17:40.888 --> 00:17:42.123
I'm sorry.

00:17:42.156 --> 00:17:44.862
I just realized something
while fighting Albinass.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.977
I never actually
knew what true love is.

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.278
I thought I did, but...

00:17:53.312 --> 00:17:56.619
Lady Amy, and Merle,
and even Albinass,

00:17:56.653 --> 00:17:58.923
they were all willing
to sacrifice themselves

00:17:58.957 --> 00:18:01.194
for the people they loved.

00:18:01.227 --> 00:18:03.165
To truly be in
love with someone

00:18:03.198 --> 00:18:05.202
is a fierce and
powerful thing...

00:18:05.236 --> 00:18:07.373
It's beyond control.

00:18:07.406 --> 00:18:09.879
I don't know if
I'm capable of that...

00:18:09.912 --> 00:18:11.348
I just don't know.

00:18:11.381 --> 00:18:12.718
It never even crossed my mind

00:18:12.751 --> 00:18:15.557
that I might be able to feel
that way about someone...

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:19.030
or that someone would feel
that way about me, either...

00:18:19.063 --> 00:18:20.967
Maybe you do...

00:18:21.001 --> 00:18:23.607
And that means you've been hurt
and suffered so many times...

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.614
All just because of me, and
I-I never asked you to do that.

00:18:28.449 --> 00:18:30.153
But, Maam...

00:18:30.186 --> 00:18:31.923
I am sorry.

00:18:31.956 --> 00:18:34.027
I know it's not
what you wanted to hear,

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:35.363
but I can't tell you something

00:18:35.396 --> 00:18:37.099
just because you
want to hear it...

00:18:37.133 --> 00:18:39.939
Not until I know for sure.

00:18:39.973 --> 00:18:41.408
Maam: But listen, Popp...

00:18:42.545 --> 00:18:44.448
If you're willing to
wait a little,

00:18:44.481 --> 00:18:47.086
would you give me a
chance to figure that out?

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.288
A chance?

00:18:48.322 --> 00:18:50.326
I don't know if we'll
even survive this fight,

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.696
but here's what I do know:

00:18:51.729 --> 00:18:53.966
If somehow, we both
make it out of this,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.340
and the future's a thing for
us to have instead of save,

00:18:57.373 --> 00:18:59.845
I'd at least be willing
to give it a shot.

00:18:59.879 --> 00:19:03.753
The reason I love you is because
of how strong you are inside.

00:19:03.787 --> 00:19:05.223
I've seen you grow so much

00:19:05.256 --> 00:19:07.359
through every battle
we've won together.

00:19:07.393 --> 00:19:10.834
Right now, I need you to lend
me some of that strength.

00:19:10.867 --> 00:19:12.505
So we can go save this world.

00:19:12.538 --> 00:19:14.776
We'll fight for the future.

00:19:14.809 --> 00:19:16.813
Like, our future?

00:19:16.846 --> 00:19:17.814
Maam: When this is over,

00:19:17.848 --> 00:19:20.220
I can't make any
promises that I'll be able to

00:19:20.253 --> 00:19:22.524
love you the same
way that you love me.

00:19:22.558 --> 00:19:25.062
I don't even know how I feel
about Hyunckel, really.

00:19:25.096 --> 00:19:26.566
But I know I'll be able to

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:28.704
become someone
I wasn't before...

00:19:28.737 --> 00:19:31.241
Someone with the answer.

00:19:31.274 --> 00:19:33.178
So whatever the future holds,

00:19:33.212 --> 00:19:36.018
the only way to find out
is to get through this fight

00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:37.954
the same way we always do...

00:19:37.988 --> 00:19:39.391
together.

00:19:39.424 --> 00:19:41.261
Until we're on
the other side of this,

00:19:41.294 --> 00:19:44.001
I think that's the
only answer I can give you.

00:19:44.034 --> 00:19:46.438
I hope it's... enough.

00:19:48.242 --> 00:19:50.013
Maam [thought]: Oh, Maam...

00:19:50.046 --> 00:19:51.516
It's more than enough.

00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:56.391
In fact, it's even more
than I deserve. Thank you.

00:19:56.425 --> 00:20:00.099
I'm... I'm so glad that...

00:20:00.132 --> 00:20:02.604
I fell in love with you.

00:20:03.038 --> 00:20:04.173
Popp?

00:20:04.207 --> 00:20:05.678
Popp: So, let me
get this straight...

00:20:05.711 --> 00:20:08.215
If the Dark King
ends up killing all of us,

00:20:08.248 --> 00:20:10.587
then that's that, right?
End of story?

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.391
Morbid, but yeah.
I guess so.

00:20:15.462 --> 00:20:17.901
Popp: Then...
can I get an advance?

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.677
Huh? W-What?!

00:20:24.915 --> 00:20:27.019
Relax. Close
your eyes, Maam.

00:20:28.523 --> 00:20:30.259
Are... Are you kidding?

00:20:31.094 --> 00:20:32.363
Maam: P-Popp...

00:20:39.912 --> 00:20:41.147
[playful chuckle]

00:20:41.181 --> 00:20:43.886
Of course, I'm kidding.
Fooled you!

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.126
Popp: C'mon. Even I'm
not brave enough to do that.

00:20:47.159 --> 00:20:48.495
But you actually
closed your eyes.

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:49.632
You know what that means?

00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:51.334
Part of you wanted
it to happen!

00:20:51.368 --> 00:20:53.539
See? You do have
feelings for me!

00:20:53.573 --> 00:20:55.375
[giggling]

00:20:56.111 --> 00:20:57.446
W-Why you...

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.486
brainless, insensitive,
and totally dead man!

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.291
Popp: [pained shrieking]

00:21:04.829 --> 00:21:06.030
Hey, Maam...

00:21:06.064 --> 00:21:07.233
What now?!

00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:09.103
Let's go win this thing.

00:21:09.137 --> 00:21:11.241
I want to see that future.

00:21:11.274 --> 00:21:13.980
Even if it's the one
where I get shot down.

00:21:15.884 --> 00:21:17.019
Maam: You dummy.

00:21:21.796 --> 00:21:23.365
Whoa, ouch.

00:21:23.398 --> 00:21:24.968
Yeah - it's hot.

00:21:26.037 --> 00:21:28.776
Leona: Popp! Maam!

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.179
There you guys are.

00:21:30.212 --> 00:21:31.682
[happy chirping]

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:36.859
It looks like your fight
with Sigma was a tough one.

00:21:36.892 --> 00:21:38.696
Uh... Y-Yeah...

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:40.399
Popp [thought]:
I mean, Maam gave me

00:21:40.433 --> 00:21:42.102
most of these
bruises, but...

00:21:42.136 --> 00:21:44.074
Why are we all
just standing here?

00:21:44.107 --> 00:21:46.145
Where did Dai and Hadlar go?

00:21:46.178 --> 00:21:47.380
Take a look.

00:21:47.414 --> 00:21:49.451
What am I looking at here?

00:21:49.484 --> 00:21:51.421
I can't see anything
through all this...

00:21:51.454 --> 00:21:54.027
It's just a huge swirling
ball of sheer heat...

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:57.333
Are you telling me Dai's
somewhere in the middle of that?

00:23:37.867 --> 00:23:40.105
Narrator: With the
Royal Guard defeated at last,

00:23:40.138 --> 00:23:42.511
the Disciples of Avan move
to help their leader...

00:23:42.544 --> 00:23:44.247
But the clash
between Dai and Hadlar

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.051
rivals one from
Underworld tales,

00:23:46.084 --> 00:23:48.857
and not even the Dark King
himself will intervene.

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.060
Soon the duel
approaches its conclusion,

00:23:51.094 --> 00:23:52.530
and with Dai's Avan Strash

00:23:52.564 --> 00:23:54.868
pitted against Hadlar's
Ultra Combustion Slash,

00:23:54.902 --> 00:23:56.939
there's no telling who
will come out on top...

00:23:56.973 --> 00:23:58.643
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:58.676 --> 00:24:00.713
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:00.747 --> 00:24:02.884
"Battle of True Dragons".
