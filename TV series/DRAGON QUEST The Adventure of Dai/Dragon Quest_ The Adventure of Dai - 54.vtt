00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:51.924
[snarling]

00:01:51.957 --> 00:01:53.226
A Boom spell?!

00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:58.504
[roaring]

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:08.724
Alright...

00:02:08.758 --> 00:02:09.793
You!

00:02:10.962 --> 00:02:12.431
Sizzle...

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:13.366
Dai!

00:02:16.773 --> 00:02:17.809
[pained grunt]

00:02:26.325 --> 00:02:28.931
Dai [thought]:
This is impossible...

00:02:28.964 --> 00:02:30.801
Baran [thought]:
We won't win this way.

00:02:31.637 --> 00:02:33.406
Kasizz!

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.303
Draconic Aura defense.
Interesting.

00:03:21.336 --> 00:03:23.373
Like father, like son.

00:03:23.406 --> 00:03:26.747
Vearn: Baran has
realized that Hadlar's body

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.451
contains a Black Core.

00:03:29.485 --> 00:03:32.190
Do you see it now,
Mystvearn?

00:03:32.224 --> 00:03:35.230
Hadlar may actually
have a chance.

00:03:35.264 --> 00:03:37.669
The attacks and spells
of these Dragon Knights

00:03:37.702 --> 00:03:40.173
are too powerful,
aren't they?

00:03:40.206 --> 00:03:42.779
They're afraid it
will detonate.

00:03:42.813 --> 00:03:44.516
It is an advantage-

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.189
it's keeping them from
fighting at full strength.

00:03:48.223 --> 00:03:49.526
Mystvearn: Cowards!

00:03:50.595 --> 00:03:52.999
Hadlar: Why are you
holding back?

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:54.903
Don't tell me you've
lost your nerve.

00:03:54.936 --> 00:03:58.409
What happened to the great
"Dragon Knights" of old?

00:03:59.211 --> 00:04:00.548
Father and son.

00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:03.286
Don't you know how
to fight together?

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.760
Baran, where's
your Gigabreak?!

00:04:08.731 --> 00:04:13.974
And Dai - you, too. Don't you
want to avenge your old master?

00:04:14.008 --> 00:04:15.143
Here's your chance.

00:04:15.176 --> 00:04:18.717
Go ahead and try to
take your revenge on me.

00:04:25.363 --> 00:04:27.903
Dai [thought]: That's it!
Hadlar doesn't know.

00:04:27.936 --> 00:04:31.008
Maybe if I tell him,
he'll stop fighting.

00:04:32.578 --> 00:04:33.814
Listen, Hadlar!
You've got-

00:04:33.847 --> 00:04:34.716
Baran: Don't.

00:04:35.785 --> 00:04:37.354
You mustn't tell him.

00:04:37.388 --> 00:04:39.592
Dai: Huh? Why not?!

00:04:39.626 --> 00:04:41.897
Baran: A Black Core
can be detonated

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.268
at the whim of it's creator.

00:04:44.301 --> 00:04:47.207
Once Hadlar knows it's there,

00:04:47.241 --> 00:04:50.547
Vearn will activate
it on the spot.

00:04:50.581 --> 00:04:54.822
He'll do it just to keep Hadlar
from turning against him.

00:04:57.294 --> 00:04:58.630
What's wrong?

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:01.002
Baran: We'll be fine.

00:05:01.035 --> 00:05:05.611
If we focus all our energy on
defense, we should survive.

00:05:05.645 --> 00:05:11.255
But your friends on the surface
will almost certainly perish.

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:13.560
Hadlar: Don't
insult me like this.

00:05:14.228 --> 00:05:15.598
Dai [thought]: At this rate...

00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:20.040
Hadlar: How very suspicious.
What are you up to?

00:05:20.073 --> 00:05:22.177
Just you wait and see!

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.547
Baran: Zapple!

00:05:32.632 --> 00:05:36.205
Fight me. I've seen
you in action, Hadlar.

00:05:36.238 --> 00:05:38.409
So I know the
extent of your power.

00:05:38.443 --> 00:05:42.051
As you requested of me,
I will draw my blade.

00:05:42.084 --> 00:05:46.960
Interesting. So you were just
testing me this whole time?

00:05:46.994 --> 00:05:48.463
That's good to hear.

00:05:48.497 --> 00:05:50.233
Dai: What are you doing?!

00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:53.372
Baran: I'm going to
have him explode here.

00:05:53.406 --> 00:05:56.780
It's a risk,
but I have no choice.

00:05:56.813 --> 00:05:57.448
Dai: What?!

00:05:57.481 --> 00:05:58.784
Baran: If I decapitate him,

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:02.559
he shouldn't
detonate right away.

00:06:02.592 --> 00:06:07.267
It will take a moment for Vearn
to realize what's happened.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.307
That's when I'll use
all of my Draconic Aura

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.413
available to
contain the blast.

00:06:13.446 --> 00:06:15.450
Dai: But you don't
know that'll work!

00:06:15.483 --> 00:06:16.786
What makes you think it can

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.991
be contained by
a Draconic Aura?

00:06:19.024 --> 00:06:21.062
Even one like yours?!

00:06:21.095 --> 00:06:23.700
It's way too dangerous!

00:06:32.518 --> 00:06:38.029
Baran: Dai... Tell me.
Do you trust me?

00:06:45.076 --> 00:06:46.145
Baran: Well?

00:06:49.786 --> 00:06:53.727
Dai: I... I trust your
strength more than anyone's.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.633
Baran: A good answer.

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:59.539
And I trust your
strength as well.

00:07:01.042 --> 00:07:03.614
Seeing you fight against
the Bishop and Hadlar

00:07:03.647 --> 00:07:05.584
has made me realize...

00:07:05.618 --> 00:07:08.890
You're far stronger than
when you last fought me.

00:07:10.594 --> 00:07:13.032
I'm impressed
with how you've grown.

00:07:14.636 --> 00:07:17.608
Baran: But this is
something only I can do...

00:07:17.642 --> 00:07:21.583
With my sword skills and
abundance of Draconic Aura.

00:07:21.616 --> 00:07:24.622
So I'm going to
need you to trust me.

00:07:26.358 --> 00:07:27.896
And get your
friends out of here,

00:07:27.929 --> 00:07:30.668
just in case
things go poorly.

00:07:31.836 --> 00:07:34.542
Take that hole to the surface.

00:07:35.678 --> 00:07:37.414
Baran: No matter
what happens to me,

00:07:37.448 --> 00:07:40.588
I promise I'll
take care of Hadlar.

00:07:40.621 --> 00:07:43.660
I leave the fight
with King Vearn to you.

00:07:43.693 --> 00:07:47.568
Dai, I truly hope
that you win.

00:07:47.602 --> 00:07:52.210
For you... and for
those who believe in you.

00:07:54.783 --> 00:07:55.818
[growling]

00:07:55.852 --> 00:08:04.201
[roaring]

00:08:06.372 --> 00:08:07.708
[chuckling]

00:08:07.742 --> 00:08:11.115
What impressive
power we wield.

00:08:11.149 --> 00:08:14.421
You have your Ultimate
Blade and Gigabreak...

00:08:14.455 --> 00:08:18.730
And I have my Ultra
Combustion Slash!

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:22.404
Both infuse our blades
with supercharged energy

00:08:22.438 --> 00:08:26.880
to destroy our enemies
at the moment of impact.

00:08:26.913 --> 00:08:31.222
So that means, the first
to land a hit wins.

00:08:31.255 --> 00:08:35.463
It seems all will be
decided by who is fastest!

00:08:35.496 --> 00:08:37.768
Yes... It will.

00:08:37.802 --> 00:08:41.977
Hadlar: I doubt that either of
us will require a second strike.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:46.051
Both attacks are strong
enough to end everything.

00:08:46.085 --> 00:08:50.460
Dai [thought]: Maybe...
Maybe I should help him.

00:08:50.494 --> 00:08:53.466
Maybe I can use my
own Draconic Aura...

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:55.638
to help contain the blast...

00:08:55.671 --> 00:08:58.711
Baran: Do not interfere!

00:08:58.744 --> 00:09:01.448
Baran: What Hadlar said
is absolutely right.

00:09:01.482 --> 00:09:02.886
The timing is everything.

00:09:02.919 --> 00:09:07.261
If you interfere, it increases
my chances of failing.

00:09:07.294 --> 00:09:08.897
Dai: B-But... I...

00:09:08.931 --> 00:09:13.740
Baran: Dai... Didn't you say
that you trust my strength?

00:09:17.147 --> 00:09:18.015
Dai: All right!

00:09:18.049 --> 00:09:20.420
But once Popp and
the others are safe,

00:09:20.453 --> 00:09:22.157
I'm coming back to help.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.167
Promise me... you won't fail.

00:09:28.703 --> 00:09:33.078
Baran: Yes. You have my word.

00:09:34.615 --> 00:09:36.252
Get to safety.

00:09:36.285 --> 00:09:37.955
Hadlar? It's time!

00:09:37.989 --> 00:09:41.563
Show me a Dragon
Knight's true power!

00:09:41.596 --> 00:09:42.932
Baran: Go, Dai!

00:09:45.538 --> 00:09:46.706
Gigabreak!

00:09:46.739 --> 00:09:49.144
Hadlar: Ultra
Combustion Slash!

00:09:50.046 --> 00:09:51.381
Got you!

00:09:53.419 --> 00:09:54.321
What?

00:09:55.389 --> 00:09:56.659
Baran: Hadlar...

00:09:56.693 --> 00:09:58.362
It's over!

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.036
H-He did it!

00:10:03.339 --> 00:10:04.241
[shocked gasp]

00:10:05.076 --> 00:10:06.378
But, how?!

00:10:06.411 --> 00:10:08.115
Baran: It didn't cut through!

00:10:09.519 --> 00:10:10.587
Look out!

00:10:10.621 --> 00:10:12.658
[roaring]

00:10:16.365 --> 00:10:18.369
D-Dai?!

00:10:23.479 --> 00:10:24.882
Dino!

00:11:02.157 --> 00:11:03.192
Move!

00:11:05.463 --> 00:11:06.265
Dino!

00:11:06.299 --> 00:11:07.502
Dino, you have to wake up!

00:11:07.535 --> 00:11:08.637
Please!

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.141
Baran [thought]: No!
The wound is too deep.

00:11:11.174 --> 00:11:14.783
Left untreated,
it could be fatal!

00:11:14.816 --> 00:11:17.186
Dai: [pained groaning]

00:11:17.955 --> 00:11:19.024
Dino...

00:11:20.493 --> 00:11:24.869
Who? Oh, right.
Y-You mean me.

00:11:24.903 --> 00:11:28.175
Looks... like the
attack didn't work.

00:11:28.208 --> 00:11:30.379
It-It's strange.

00:11:30.413 --> 00:11:33.419
When you first fought me,
your Gigabreak...

00:11:33.452 --> 00:11:36.793
It seemed a whole
lot stronger...

00:11:38.429 --> 00:11:40.366
That's enough. Don't talk.

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:42.170
Let's get you healed up first.

00:11:45.376 --> 00:11:46.980
Hadlar [thought]: How?

00:11:47.014 --> 00:11:49.919
Nothing should have been
able to survive that.

00:11:49.952 --> 00:11:52.858
Baran's attack was
perfectly timed-

00:11:52.892 --> 00:11:55.396
and at the optimal range.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:59.639
How could I withstand a strike
from the Dragon Master...

00:11:59.672 --> 00:12:02.310
and endure it so easily?

00:12:03.445 --> 00:12:04.849
Hadlar: How?!

00:12:05.984 --> 00:12:10.059
Killvearn: Allow me
to answer that question.

00:12:10.093 --> 00:12:11.295
Killvearn!

00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:12.865
Baran: You're still alive?

00:12:13.634 --> 00:12:15.069
Killvearn: [chuckling]

00:12:15.103 --> 00:12:18.343
It'd be a pretty sad world if
even a reaper could be killed.

00:12:18.376 --> 00:12:19.913
Of course, I'm alive.

00:12:19.946 --> 00:12:22.150
Yeah! The undying man!

00:12:22.183 --> 00:12:26.425
But how? When I left you...
you were in pieces!

00:12:26.458 --> 00:12:27.829
Killvearn: That's the thing.

00:12:27.862 --> 00:12:30.801
You took your eyes off
me too soon, Baran.

00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:32.203
How's that?

00:12:32.237 --> 00:12:34.942
Killvearn: The blood in my
veins has the same composition

00:12:34.976 --> 00:12:37.314
as Underworld magma.

00:12:37.347 --> 00:12:42.625
It's extremely hot and
contains a powerful acid.

00:12:42.658 --> 00:12:47.568
And you went and cut me in half
- very painful, by the way -

00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:52.678
but getting my blood all over
your Demon Dragon Blade.

00:12:52.712 --> 00:12:56.351
So, you see, my blood
corroded your weapon,

00:12:56.385 --> 00:13:01.061
and dulled the edge of
your incredible blade.

00:13:01.095 --> 00:13:04.334
Even the Demon Dragon
Blade can't regenerate

00:13:04.367 --> 00:13:07.675
from that kind of
damage so quickly.

00:13:07.708 --> 00:13:10.313
Against someone as
strong as Hadlar here,

00:13:10.347 --> 00:13:14.856
it completely loses
its effectiveness.

00:13:14.889 --> 00:13:18.262
This is my curse, Baran.

00:13:18.295 --> 00:13:19.766
You may evade me,

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:23.272
but there are consequences
for all actions.

00:13:23.305 --> 00:13:28.182
A reaper always gets
their target in the end.

00:13:28.215 --> 00:13:31.288
So there you have it, Hadlar.

00:13:31.322 --> 00:13:34.094
I doubt you'd like
me taking your prey,

00:13:34.127 --> 00:13:36.198
I'll leave the rest to you.

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:39.705
Be sure to take
care of him for me.

00:13:39.739 --> 00:13:42.143
Reaper. I was not
aware that you were

00:13:42.177 --> 00:13:45.149
under orders to
eliminate Baran.

00:13:45.182 --> 00:13:48.289
It's all cloak and
dagger with you.

00:13:48.322 --> 00:13:50.661
Killvearn:
That's an ugly wound.

00:13:50.694 --> 00:13:52.932
Piroro! Tend to him, will you?

00:13:52.965 --> 00:13:54.735
No. It'll heal.

00:13:54.769 --> 00:13:58.142
Piroro: Now, now.
Don't be like that.

00:13:58.175 --> 00:14:02.017
Killvearn: Learn to accept
people's generosity, Hadlar.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.320
So long as our friend
Baran is eliminated,

00:14:04.354 --> 00:14:07.895
my job will be
considered complete.

00:14:07.928 --> 00:14:10.066
One more thing.

00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:14.509
I'd advise against showing
these two any mercy.

00:14:14.542 --> 00:14:16.813
You should crush them at once.

00:14:16.847 --> 00:14:18.583
You may want a fair fight,

00:14:18.617 --> 00:14:22.290
but his sword won't
regenerate for quite a while.

00:14:22.323 --> 00:14:25.630
Do you have that
sort of time left?

00:14:26.833 --> 00:14:27.835
How did you...?

00:14:27.868 --> 00:14:30.273
Hooray! It's all healed now.

00:14:30.306 --> 00:14:33.647
Oh wait. There's another
wound over here.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:34.682
[alarmed breath]

00:14:34.716 --> 00:14:36.519
Piroro: Let me take
care of that...

00:14:41.261 --> 00:14:42.497
[evil laughter]

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:44.602
Baran [thought]: They know.

00:14:44.635 --> 00:14:48.042
They're not backing down so
that Hadlar can have the glory;

00:14:48.075 --> 00:14:51.950
they want to avoid
the Black Core's explosion!

00:14:51.983 --> 00:14:54.889
Killvearn: Goodbye
and good luck, Hadlar.

00:14:54.923 --> 00:14:58.296
You too, Baran.
Not that it'll help.

00:14:58.329 --> 00:14:59.397
[giggle]

00:15:00.667 --> 00:15:04.207
I'd prefer to win this
without Killvearn's help.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.347
But I don't have the
luxury of waiting until

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.319
you both are ready
to fight again.

00:15:10.353 --> 00:15:14.294
So I won't be
holding back, Baran.

00:15:14.327 --> 00:15:17.735
Baran [thought]: No...
If I stop the healing spell now,

00:15:17.768 --> 00:15:19.404
Dino might not survive!

00:15:19.437 --> 00:15:23.412
I can't let go of him, no
matter what attack may come.

00:15:25.249 --> 00:15:27.621
You choose to protect the boy.

00:15:27.654 --> 00:15:29.091
Well, so be it.

00:15:29.124 --> 00:15:32.532
I can't extend the
inevitable any longer.

00:15:32.565 --> 00:15:35.269
Let us finish this at last.

00:15:36.973 --> 00:15:39.077
D-Dodge it!

00:15:39.111 --> 00:15:42.584
Forget about me.
Keep fighting.

00:15:45.323 --> 00:15:46.993
Kaboom!

00:16:06.566 --> 00:16:07.433
Dino!

00:16:11.375 --> 00:16:15.182
H-How could you...
be so... so reckless?!

00:16:18.824 --> 00:16:20.961
I'm fine. I can fight.

00:16:20.995 --> 00:16:24.367
Somehow I'm already
fully healed.

00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:26.138
[wincing]

00:16:26.172 --> 00:16:28.610
Stop pretending! You can
barely hold yourself up.

00:16:28.643 --> 00:16:29.478
That's enough.

00:16:29.512 --> 00:16:31.115
What?

00:16:31.148 --> 00:16:33.252
Dai: All of this
covering for each other,

00:16:33.285 --> 00:16:37.159
and walking on eggshells
while we're trying to fight...

00:16:38.362 --> 00:16:39.431
I've had it!

00:16:39.464 --> 00:16:43.305
We're... family,
isn't that right?

00:16:44.007 --> 00:16:45.945
Dino...

00:16:45.978 --> 00:16:48.984
If we're gonna fight
together... then trust me.

00:16:49.017 --> 00:16:52.089
Trust that the two
of us can fight as one!

00:16:52.123 --> 00:16:55.597
If we learn to respect
each other, then who knows?

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.333
Maybe we can...

00:16:57.367 --> 00:17:01.174
find a power truly
worth fighting for.

00:17:01.809 --> 00:17:03.680
A new power...

00:17:06.953 --> 00:17:09.625
Okay. Here we go, Hadlar!

00:17:13.834 --> 00:17:15.135
Darn it...

00:17:15.737 --> 00:17:18.275
I can do this!

00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:21.515
Hadlar [thought]: He
possesses such unlimited will.

00:17:37.414 --> 00:17:41.590
Baran: Very well.
I'll do as you say.

00:17:41.623 --> 00:17:42.524
Really?

00:17:44.729 --> 00:17:46.533
What... was that?!

00:17:46.566 --> 00:17:47.769
Baran: Dai.

00:17:47.802 --> 00:17:49.003
I meant to ask you...

00:17:49.037 --> 00:17:51.141
who was it that
gave you that name?

00:17:51.175 --> 00:17:54.247
It was Grampa Brass.

00:17:54.281 --> 00:17:58.021
When I washed up on
Dermline Island.

00:17:58.055 --> 00:17:59.124
My crib...

00:17:59.158 --> 00:18:02.363
It had a name plate.

00:18:02.397 --> 00:18:05.737
Only the letter "D"
was left on it.

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:09.444
Grampa gave me this
name so that at least...

00:18:09.477 --> 00:18:13.251
I'd have the initial
my real parents gave me.

00:18:19.264 --> 00:18:21.535
Why am I so sleepy?

00:18:21.569 --> 00:18:25.711
That is the sleep spell,
Kasnooze. I cast it on you.

00:18:25.744 --> 00:18:30.219
So just leave the fighting to
me and get some rest, okay?

00:18:30.253 --> 00:18:33.258
But why?
I would fight with you.

00:18:33.292 --> 00:18:35.965
Lie still and let
yourself heal, son.

00:18:35.998 --> 00:18:38.536
Dragon Knights have
unmatched abilities.

00:18:38.569 --> 00:18:42.077
We can heal faster
than others can.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:46.218
How could... how could
you do this to me?

00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:47.921
You may wish otherwise,

00:18:47.954 --> 00:18:52.096
but I now realize that this
is what a parent must do.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:55.370
You will understand
when you grow up.

00:18:55.403 --> 00:18:57.373
Please, don't do this!

00:18:57.406 --> 00:19:00.781
I'll fight...
I'll fight with you...

00:19:00.814 --> 00:19:03.151
"Dai", huh?

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.424
It's a good name.

00:19:06.458 --> 00:19:11.034
But I hope you'll remember the
name that Soala and I gave you.

00:19:11.068 --> 00:19:17.179
"Dino". In the Alkeed language
it means, "Strong Dragon".

00:19:18.884 --> 00:19:20.386
But, why?

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:24.628
Why does everybody pull
the same trick on me?

00:19:24.661 --> 00:19:26.097
Even Master...

00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:30.472
Even Master cast Kaclang
on me, and then he...

00:19:30.974 --> 00:19:32.309
I see.

00:19:32.343 --> 00:19:35.917
So Avan used the
same sort of tactic.

00:19:36.853 --> 00:19:37.788
Well, then.

00:19:37.822 --> 00:19:39.525
It seems as if I...

00:19:39.558 --> 00:19:42.899
maybe a little too late
for it to change things...

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:45.302
I did learn to be human.

00:19:46.004 --> 00:19:48.108
Dai: This can't be the end!

00:19:48.141 --> 00:19:49.645
It can't be...

00:19:50.714 --> 00:19:52.718
N-No...

00:19:52.751 --> 00:19:54.287
It's not...

00:19:54.989 --> 00:19:56.625
It's not...

00:19:59.064 --> 00:20:00.299
fair.

00:20:04.508 --> 00:20:07.814
Baran: Come on!
Good night, Dino.

00:20:09.184 --> 00:20:11.355
Go to sleep.

00:20:11.388 --> 00:20:17.935
Baby Dai: [crying]

00:20:17.968 --> 00:20:19.905
Come on, Dino!

00:20:21.041 --> 00:20:22.979
What's wrong, son?

00:20:23.012 --> 00:20:23.980
[sigh]

00:20:24.013 --> 00:20:26.451
Baran. You're doing it wrong.

00:20:26.484 --> 00:20:29.958
Go to sleep, Dino.
Sweet dreams.

00:20:31.094 --> 00:20:32.698
It just takes some time.

00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:35.871
I'm pretty sure you'll get
the hang of it, someday!

00:20:35.904 --> 00:20:38.810
Baran [thought]: It looks
like you were right, Soala.

00:20:41.883 --> 00:20:45.657
I never did get the hang
of putting him to sleep.

00:20:55.409 --> 00:21:00.019
Well, look at you. A true
parent at heart, Baran.

00:21:00.053 --> 00:21:02.423
Prepare yourself, Hadlar.

00:21:02.457 --> 00:21:06.532
I swore I'd never use
this power again, but...

00:21:06.566 --> 00:21:09.437
You've left me no choice.

00:21:10.272 --> 00:21:11.809
Hadlar: That's...

00:21:13.079 --> 00:21:17.153
Believe me, I didn't put Dino
to sleep for his well being...

00:21:17.187 --> 00:21:21.896
I took this terrible form when
we last battled each other...

00:21:23.299 --> 00:21:26.404
I never want Dino to
see it again!

00:21:32.016 --> 00:21:33.318
Your true form!

00:21:33.351 --> 00:21:34.922
The Dragonoid!

00:21:40.533 --> 00:21:41.903
Hadlar: [laughing]

00:21:41.936 --> 00:21:42.905
I see.

00:21:42.938 --> 00:21:44.274
So you plan to fight in

00:21:44.307 --> 00:21:47.781
the Dragon Knight's
ultimate battle mode!

00:21:47.815 --> 00:21:50.987
Then fine. I accept
your challenge!

00:21:53.994 --> 00:21:58.770
Well, Hadlar? The two of
us can go to hell together!

00:21:58.803 --> 00:22:02.544
[excruciated howl]

00:22:02.578 --> 00:22:04.514
Hadlar: C-Curse you!

00:23:37.768 --> 00:23:40.840
Narrator: While the Disciples
of Avan battle the Royal Guard,

00:23:40.874 --> 00:23:43.680
Baran assumes his
Dragonoid form once again

00:23:43.713 --> 00:23:45.984
and faces off against Hadlar.

00:23:46.017 --> 00:23:48.789
With the fate of his
son hanging in the balance,

00:23:48.823 --> 00:23:51.662
Baran unleashes
his full fury...

00:23:51.695 --> 00:23:54.000
But King Vearn
watches from his throne,

00:23:54.034 --> 00:23:57.172
and could detonate his
henchman at any moment.

00:23:57.206 --> 00:23:58.676
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:58.709 --> 00:24:01.248
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:01.281 --> 00:24:03.552
"The Black Core."
