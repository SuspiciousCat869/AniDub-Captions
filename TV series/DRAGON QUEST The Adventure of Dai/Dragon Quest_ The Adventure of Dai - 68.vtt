WEBVTT

00:01:55.163 --> 00:01:57.435
Popp: No, M-Merle. Come back.

00:01:57.468 --> 00:02:00.173
Please...
Just open your eyes!

00:02:00.207 --> 00:02:03.714
Come on... You can't die.
You... You can't!

00:02:03.747 --> 00:02:05.150
I won't let you...

00:02:05.885 --> 00:02:10.695
Not for someone like me.

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:16.607
Wait, Popp's a Mage,
but somehow...

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.744
He's able to
use healing energy?

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.252
Just like...
Just like a Sage does!

00:02:30.568 --> 00:02:32.773
Zaboera: What?
How could this happen?

00:02:32.806 --> 00:02:34.142
There's no way that brat

00:02:34.175 --> 00:02:37.048
could've been hiding
this much Magical Energy.

00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:39.085
I'll put a stop to this.

00:02:39.118 --> 00:02:40.254
Nova: [roaring]

00:02:40.287 --> 00:02:42.825
You won't interfere
again if I can help it!

00:02:47.235 --> 00:02:48.737
She... She's alive.

00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:49.707
Her heart's still beating.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.378
I hear it. The poison's
effect is lifting.

00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:54.649
She just might survive this.

00:02:54.683 --> 00:02:56.753
Leona: It's all thanks
to that healing energy

00:02:56.787 --> 00:02:58.524
Popp just unleashed.

00:02:58.558 --> 00:03:02.665
It looked like it was even
stronger than my Zing spell...

00:03:02.698 --> 00:03:03.901
A Kazing, maybe.

00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:05.838
I knew you could do it, Popp.

00:03:07.742 --> 00:03:10.982
Popp: Amy; see what you
can do for her now.

00:03:11.015 --> 00:03:12.519
Whatever it takes.

00:03:12.552 --> 00:03:13.654
Right.

00:03:13.688 --> 00:03:16.292
Okay. Let's do this!

00:03:17.395 --> 00:03:20.133
You heard him, everybody.
This is for Merle.

00:03:20.167 --> 00:03:21.002
You ready?

00:03:21.036 --> 00:03:22.337
It's time.

00:03:55.805 --> 00:03:57.575
Oh, wow - it's working!

00:03:57.608 --> 00:03:59.746
Leona: The circle is complete.

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:01.918
I couldn't have
summoned this light...

00:04:01.951 --> 00:04:03.654
without Merle's love.

00:04:03.687 --> 00:04:06.861
The truth is, she's been
far braver than I ever was

00:04:06.894 --> 00:04:07.962
-without a doubt.

00:04:09.533 --> 00:04:13.807
And so, now... I am not
going to let her down!

00:04:28.103 --> 00:04:29.438
Finally...

00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:33.079
They've done it - they have
all five pillars of light!

00:04:33.112 --> 00:04:37.622
Now - watch it shine:
the great Purification Spell.

00:04:48.877 --> 00:04:50.915
Now... Kaglimmer!

00:05:12.124 --> 00:05:13.527
Killvearn: What is this?

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:18.102
All right... Ready, Popp?

00:05:19.071 --> 00:05:20.440
Zoom!

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.773
Baduck: It worked...

00:05:36.806 --> 00:05:40.548
It worked!
The Dark King's done!

00:05:42.117 --> 00:05:45.224
[cheering]

00:05:45.257 --> 00:05:46.492
This is it.

00:05:46.526 --> 00:05:50.099
And away they go.
Good luck to you, my friends.

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:53.574
They actually pulled it off.

00:05:55.945 --> 00:05:57.682
Chiu: [chuckling]

00:05:57.716 --> 00:05:59.752
Way to go, mighty Heroes!

00:05:59.786 --> 00:06:02.324
I know you'll defeat
the Dark King...

00:06:02.357 --> 00:06:05.798
And in the end,
justice will prevail!

00:06:05.832 --> 00:06:07.835
[cheering]

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:09.673
Everyone, fall back
and form a line

00:06:09.706 --> 00:06:11.643
around the circle
of enchantment.

00:06:11.676 --> 00:06:13.446
The enemy forces
should grow weaker

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:14.783
as they approach its power.

00:06:14.817 --> 00:06:17.287
It's all up to the
Disciples from here.

00:06:17.321 --> 00:06:19.125
Let's give them
the time they need.

00:06:19.158 --> 00:06:20.527
Yes, ma'am!

00:06:29.912 --> 00:06:31.950
I guess it worked.
Where are we?

00:06:31.983 --> 00:06:34.489
If I'm not mistaken,
we've been here before.

00:06:34.523 --> 00:06:36.827
It looks like the
Palace's Citadel Gate...

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.933
This is where we lost the
last time we faced Vearn.

00:06:39.966 --> 00:06:41.268
Someone has been busy.

00:06:41.302 --> 00:06:43.640
It was pretty torn
up when we left it.

00:06:45.745 --> 00:06:47.013
You guys?

00:06:47.047 --> 00:06:50.421
I'm not going to give
any more lame excuses.

00:06:50.454 --> 00:06:51.791
I'll do everything I can

00:06:51.824 --> 00:06:54.796
to make up for the
trouble I caused you.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:02.646
Look, Maam.

00:07:02.679 --> 00:07:04.248
I know it's a shock...

00:07:04.281 --> 00:07:05.350
Y'know, Popp...

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:07.120
He's felt this way a long time

00:07:07.154 --> 00:07:08.824
-but didn't know
how to say it.

00:07:08.858 --> 00:07:11.663
If you feel the same way
at all, you should tell him.

00:07:11.696 --> 00:07:13.767
He's worked so hard to
come all this way...

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.438
And part of that was
probably for you, you know.

00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:20.515
This... This
is way too much...

00:07:20.548 --> 00:07:24.021
I mean, I- I can't deal
with this right now.

00:07:25.023 --> 00:07:26.492
I'm not ready!

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.135
Hey, uh, Leona...

00:07:31.168 --> 00:07:34.208
Maybe it's best if we
all stick together here...

00:07:34.241 --> 00:07:36.012
It's the enemy
stronghold, so...

00:07:36.045 --> 00:07:40.086
I'll be fine. Seriously, stop
treating me like a princess.

00:07:40.119 --> 00:07:41.455
Fine, I get it!

00:07:41.488 --> 00:07:44.461
I'm just saying that
I care about you, okay?

00:07:44.495 --> 00:07:45.698
Whatever.

00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:47.702
We've already wasted
enough time arguing here.

00:07:47.735 --> 00:07:49.640
Leona: This place
is dangerous!

00:07:49.673 --> 00:07:51.643
Ugh, that's what I'm saying!

00:07:55.416 --> 00:07:57.588
Vearn: A Kaglimmer spell, hm?

00:07:57.621 --> 00:08:01.161
An ancient gift from the
God of Humanity, no doubt.

00:08:01.195 --> 00:08:03.834
These annoying little
pests have managed to

00:08:03.867 --> 00:08:06.472
dig up quite an
interesting strategy.

00:08:06.506 --> 00:08:07.909
Killvearn: Indeed, they have.

00:08:07.942 --> 00:08:10.179
Are you feeling all
right, Your Majesty?

00:08:11.415 --> 00:08:13.987
I am experiencing
some effects,

00:08:14.021 --> 00:08:17.695
but not nearly enough
to suppress my power.

00:08:17.729 --> 00:08:21.670
However, I won't be able to move
Vearn Palace in this state...

00:08:21.703 --> 00:08:23.808
and the protective
field has fallen.

00:08:23.841 --> 00:08:26.045
It seems that this
enchantment of theirs

00:08:26.079 --> 00:08:29.384
is blocking my ability
to control our fortress.

00:08:29.418 --> 00:08:32.925
Killvearn: Without the field,
anybody could stroll in here.

00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.163
I suppose I should
welcome them.

00:08:37.033 --> 00:08:39.105
Just a moment...

00:08:39.138 --> 00:08:41.543
We have another guest, now.

00:08:42.044 --> 00:08:43.379
Ah, yes...

00:08:43.413 --> 00:08:45.116
This Aura.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.053
I remember it well.

00:08:47.689 --> 00:08:49.993
So, this is his move...

00:08:50.027 --> 00:08:51.061
[delighted chuckle]

00:09:04.288 --> 00:09:05.557
It's you.

00:09:09.464 --> 00:09:10.567
[alarmed gasp]

00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:22.525
Dai: What did you do
with my friends?

00:09:22.558 --> 00:09:24.328
While you're busy
dealing with me,

00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:27.668
I thought my Royal Guard
could keep them occupied.

00:09:28.604 --> 00:09:30.140
And what do you want?

00:09:30.173 --> 00:09:33.547
It's quite simple.
I only have one wish:

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.452
A one-on-one duel
against you...

00:09:36.485 --> 00:09:38.456
to settle our quarrel.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.295
A... A duel with me?

00:10:03.139 --> 00:10:06.913
Why, you...
Hang on - where am I?

00:10:06.946 --> 00:10:10.286
What the... This looks like
the other side of the palace.

00:10:10.888 --> 00:10:13.359
Sigma: Exactly, Mage.

00:10:13.393 --> 00:10:17.835
I thought it best to bring you
to the tail section for this.

00:10:17.868 --> 00:10:20.675
You're not the only one
who can cast Zoom spells.

00:10:20.708 --> 00:10:23.313
Popp: You're Sigma...
Hadlar's knight.

00:10:23.346 --> 00:10:26.720
I'm glad you
haven't forgotten.

00:10:26.753 --> 00:10:29.959
Now, then. Lord Hadlar doesn't
want any interference...

00:10:29.993 --> 00:10:33.132
while he takes his
time with the Hero.

00:10:33.165 --> 00:10:36.472
So in the meantime,
I shall be dealing with you.

00:10:36.506 --> 00:10:38.511
Then... Maam
and the others...

00:10:38.544 --> 00:10:39.444
[chuckling]

00:10:39.478 --> 00:10:40.848
Much like yourself,

00:10:40.881 --> 00:10:43.920
they all have their own
challenge to reckon with.

00:10:53.373 --> 00:10:56.012
Hyunckel [thought]: This is
the palace's southeast wing.

00:10:56.045 --> 00:10:58.449
Hym: I hope you're
excited, Hyunckel.

00:10:59.819 --> 00:11:01.456
Hyunckel: Hym...

00:11:01.489 --> 00:11:02.925
I don't know about you,

00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.531
but I've been looking
forward to this day.

00:11:05.564 --> 00:11:06.667
[dismissive scoff]

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.904
Well, I hate to
disappoint you, tin man...

00:11:08.938 --> 00:11:10.807
but I don't feel a thing.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.914
You call that a comeback?

00:11:13.947 --> 00:11:16.151
Hyunckel: Don't waste my time.

00:11:18.991 --> 00:11:20.694
You wanna fight? Then try.

00:11:20.727 --> 00:11:22.531
Very well, then.

00:11:22.564 --> 00:11:25.102
But be careful
what you wish for.

00:11:28.877 --> 00:11:31.348
Maam [thought]: It's
the queen, Albinass...

00:11:31.381 --> 00:11:34.487
She's the strongest
of Hadlar's Royal Guard.

00:11:35.857 --> 00:11:37.695
How unfortunate.

00:11:37.728 --> 00:11:38.897
Without your friends,

00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:41.936
you don't stand a chance
against me, little girl.

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:43.039
Don't take it personally,

00:11:43.073 --> 00:11:45.878
the plan just worked
out best this way.

00:11:45.911 --> 00:11:48.082
I hope you enjoy surprises.

00:11:48.115 --> 00:11:52.124
I'm not surprised;
It's not hard.

00:11:52.157 --> 00:11:54.095
Each of you chose
the opponent

00:11:54.128 --> 00:11:57.033
that you'd be the
most likely to overcome.

00:11:57.067 --> 00:11:59.438
With the Mirror of Shahal,

00:11:59.471 --> 00:12:00.975
Sigma can deflect
Popp's spells;

00:12:01.008 --> 00:12:03.446
and Hym has already
fought against Hyunckel,

00:12:03.479 --> 00:12:05.551
so he'll know what to expect.

00:12:05.584 --> 00:12:08.958
So that leaves you
to tangle with me.

00:12:08.991 --> 00:12:11.830
[patronizing chuckle]

00:12:11.863 --> 00:12:14.434
Well, those are some
very astute observations.

00:12:14.468 --> 00:12:18.042
I'm quite impressed, although
you did make one small error.

00:12:18.075 --> 00:12:19.979
You see, aside from the Hero,

00:12:20.013 --> 00:12:23.319
the only real threats we
have are Popp and Hyunckel.

00:12:23.353 --> 00:12:27.293
My job is to sweep the
leftovers off the board.

00:12:27.327 --> 00:12:29.599
I had intended to
kidnap the princess

00:12:29.632 --> 00:12:31.970
in case Dai tried to back out,

00:12:32.003 --> 00:12:33.673
but that annoying
little creature

00:12:33.707 --> 00:12:36.345
got in my way before
I could take her.

00:12:36.378 --> 00:12:38.148
What do you mean "creature"?

00:12:40.286 --> 00:12:41.388
That's right, Dai.

00:12:41.421 --> 00:12:43.994
Now we shall both lay
everything on the line...

00:12:44.027 --> 00:12:47.801
and trade blows in a
final showdown, man-to-man.

00:12:49.371 --> 00:12:50.907
Leona: Hold it right there!

00:12:51.442 --> 00:12:53.378
Not on my watch, mister.

00:12:53.412 --> 00:12:56.419
My underlings appear to have
missed one of your friends.

00:12:56.452 --> 00:12:57.286
Leona...

00:12:58.657 --> 00:12:59.658
Gomechan?!

00:12:59.692 --> 00:13:01.362
When we all got hit
with that spell,

00:13:01.395 --> 00:13:04.134
he popped out to help
at the last second.

00:13:07.373 --> 00:13:10.815
[determined chirp]

00:13:10.848 --> 00:13:12.016
I don't know how,

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.087
but he stopped the
effect of the enchantment.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.058
I guess we had
a little stowaway

00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:18.764
when Popp was Zooming
us all up here.

00:13:18.797 --> 00:13:20.634
Pretty sneaky. Thanks a lot.

00:13:20.667 --> 00:13:21.903
[loyal chirps]

00:13:21.936 --> 00:13:23.372
Anyhow, come on.

00:13:23.405 --> 00:13:26.846
This really isn't the
time for some stupid duel.

00:13:28.616 --> 00:13:30.888
And Hadlar, that
goes for you, too.

00:13:30.921 --> 00:13:33.627
You turned against
King Vearn, didn't you?

00:13:33.661 --> 00:13:34.996
Well think about it.

00:13:35.029 --> 00:13:38.537
If you fight Dai here, all
you're doing is serving him.

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.239
You want to settle
a score? Fine.

00:13:40.273 --> 00:13:42.978
But why don't you save
it for a better moment?

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.049
Not an option.

00:13:48.088 --> 00:13:52.130
I no longer...
have that kind of time.

00:13:56.138 --> 00:13:57.240
Dai [thought]:
That's right...

00:13:57.274 --> 00:14:00.079
Superior Beings
don't last forever.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:12.938
It was worth a try, but I
guess he's not backing down.

00:14:12.971 --> 00:14:15.877
Fine. I'll help
you take him out.

00:14:15.911 --> 00:14:17.447
Dai: Leona,
you'd better get back.

00:14:18.449 --> 00:14:21.355
Leona: W-What? No!
What are you talking about?

00:14:21.388 --> 00:14:23.794
You don't have to go
along with this, Dai.

00:14:23.827 --> 00:14:25.362
Besides,
together we could...

00:14:26.499 --> 00:14:26.967
Ow!

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.068
[surprised chirps]

00:14:33.312 --> 00:14:34.481
Dai, wait...

00:14:36.652 --> 00:14:37.955
Dai: I'm sorry.

00:14:37.989 --> 00:14:41.462
But... things are
about to get hotter.

00:14:41.495 --> 00:14:44.101
So I need you to back away.

00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:47.174
Hadlar is already
too far gone to save.

00:14:47.207 --> 00:14:48.175
Huh?!

00:14:49.311 --> 00:14:51.883
Dai: Superior Beings might
have instant regeneration,

00:14:51.916 --> 00:14:54.522
but their power can
only last for so long

00:14:54.555 --> 00:14:56.158
before it burns out...

00:14:56.191 --> 00:14:59.030
And that means Hadlar's doesn't
have a lot of time left.

00:14:59.063 --> 00:15:01.101
Even still,
he's decided to risk

00:15:01.134 --> 00:15:04.875
whatever remains of his life
to fight for his honor...

00:15:04.909 --> 00:15:06.946
and he's chosen
me as his opponent.

00:15:06.979 --> 00:15:09.217
It wouldn't be right
for me to turn him down

00:15:09.251 --> 00:15:11.488
and deny him his
one last chance.

00:15:12.525 --> 00:15:16.098
Dai: I know we still
have to defeat King Vearn.

00:15:16.132 --> 00:15:19.305
I'd rather not fight
- either of them.

00:15:19.338 --> 00:15:24.047
But... if I don't
accept this challenge...

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:28.055
What right to call
myself a hero.

00:15:29.457 --> 00:15:31.094
So I have to.

00:15:31.128 --> 00:15:34.502
I'm sorry about this -
and I'll make it up to you.

00:15:39.111 --> 00:15:40.213
Leona [thought]: Wow...

00:15:40.246 --> 00:15:42.552
You've gotta love
a man with integrity-

00:15:42.585 --> 00:15:44.054
even if he's an idiot.

00:15:44.087 --> 00:15:46.458
He sure grew up fast.

00:15:53.673 --> 00:15:54.742
Hadlar?

00:15:54.776 --> 00:15:57.648
If it's really what you want,
I'll take you on...

00:15:57.682 --> 00:15:59.752
with everything I've got.

00:15:59.785 --> 00:16:01.488
Thank you, Dai.

00:16:03.894 --> 00:16:06.966
Feel free to enjoy
the show, King Vearn.

00:16:06.999 --> 00:16:10.607
This glorious battle shall
mark the end of my days.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:11.509
Understand...

00:16:11.543 --> 00:16:14.615
that if any of your
forces intervene,

00:16:14.649 --> 00:16:16.318
you have my word
it will cost you

00:16:16.352 --> 00:16:19.257
even more than
you can imagine.

00:16:19.291 --> 00:16:21.495
As you wish, Lord Hadlar.

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:25.436
Go ahead and fight to
your heart's content.

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:28.208
May you meet your
end with no regrets.

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:29.946
All right.

00:16:29.979 --> 00:16:32.450
What if the spell is
giving me the upper hand?

00:16:34.354 --> 00:16:37.060
You mean the Kaglimmer spell?

00:16:37.093 --> 00:16:40.601
I can't deny that I feel
some of its effects,

00:16:40.634 --> 00:16:43.472
but for a being who is
as mighty as I am...

00:16:43.507 --> 00:16:45.577
[roaring]

00:16:47.414 --> 00:16:51.889
So, as you can see...
it won't be a problem.

00:16:51.923 --> 00:16:53.325
Dai: Alright, then.

00:16:53.358 --> 00:16:56.498
I guess that means the same
thing for King Vearn, as well.

00:16:56.532 --> 00:16:57.768
And right you are.

00:16:57.802 --> 00:17:01.008
The only thing being stalled by
that spell is the palace itself.

00:17:01.041 --> 00:17:04.615
Vearn's Magic Power
remains as strong as ever...

00:17:04.649 --> 00:17:06.218
Sorry to disappoint.

00:17:06.251 --> 00:17:09.525
Oh, no. See, I'm
actually relieved.

00:17:09.558 --> 00:17:13.032
I'd hate for you to not get
a fair chance at revenge.

00:17:13.065 --> 00:17:14.535
It wouldn't feel right.

00:17:16.104 --> 00:17:18.677
Well, how very thoughtful...

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:20.446
The little Hero...

00:17:21.448 --> 00:17:22.618
Here it comes.

00:17:26.693 --> 00:17:29.966
Leona: We... we should probably
get a little further back.

00:17:29.999 --> 00:17:31.168
C'mon!

00:17:31.202 --> 00:17:32.738
Gomechan: [worried chirp]

00:17:34.942 --> 00:17:37.715
[charging roar]

00:17:37.748 --> 00:17:41.288
[roaring punch]

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:48.402
[alarmed cry]

00:17:51.374 --> 00:17:53.412
And the battle begins...

00:17:53.445 --> 00:17:56.753
A final duel between
Lord Hadlar and the Hero.

00:17:56.786 --> 00:17:58.122
Wait, "final"?

00:17:58.155 --> 00:17:59.592
Yes, that's right.

00:17:59.626 --> 00:18:03.032
Our Dark Lord is beyond the help
of any Healing Spell's power.

00:18:03.065 --> 00:18:06.205
His Superior form
will only decay.

00:18:06.238 --> 00:18:08.475
This will be his final wish;

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:12.249
to use what remains of
his abilities in combat.

00:18:12.283 --> 00:18:16.224
One last stand against your
bothersome little leader...

00:18:16.257 --> 00:18:18.261
a chance to defeat his rival.

00:18:21.001 --> 00:18:22.237
Hadlar: I've made my decision.

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:25.376
My body won't hold up
for much longer.

00:18:25.409 --> 00:18:28.216
So I shall face
the Hero one last time.

00:18:28.249 --> 00:18:30.386
With luck, I'll triumph.

00:18:32.825 --> 00:18:35.229
No... Y- You don't mean...

00:18:35.262 --> 00:18:39.337
I have no desire to fight
for the Dark King anymore...

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:42.376
But I cannot side with
the Disciples of Avan either.

00:18:44.515 --> 00:18:47.019
After all,
I'm the one who took

00:18:47.053 --> 00:18:48.355
what was most
precious from them,

00:18:48.388 --> 00:18:51.261
and we're still sworn enemies.

00:18:51.295 --> 00:18:55.369
Therefore, I find myself
with only one path to take.

00:18:55.402 --> 00:18:57.374
To do battle with
the only adversary

00:18:57.407 --> 00:18:59.444
who compels me to go on,

00:18:59.477 --> 00:19:02.417
and leave my final
mark on his life.

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:06.158
But that adversary
is not the Dark King.

00:19:06.192 --> 00:19:08.495
No, but... My lord!

00:19:08.529 --> 00:19:11.569
Albinass, come now.
Why are you hesitating?

00:19:11.603 --> 00:19:13.807
This is what we
were made to do.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.176
We must seek vengeance,

00:19:15.209 --> 00:19:17.280
or else we'll be
nothing but failures...

00:19:17.314 --> 00:19:19.618
and Block and Fenbren
will have died in vain.

00:19:20.954 --> 00:19:22.524
Hym: If we don't
vanquish our rivals

00:19:22.557 --> 00:19:24.695
and bring honor
to the Royal Guard

00:19:24.728 --> 00:19:27.033
how will we ever face
our fallen comrades

00:19:27.066 --> 00:19:29.572
when we meet them
in the afterlife?

00:19:29.605 --> 00:19:32.009
We go down in
a blaze of glory!

00:19:32.043 --> 00:19:35.550
First we'll defeat the Heroes,
and then we strike King Vearn.

00:19:35.583 --> 00:19:38.656
We'll show all
of them our fury!

00:19:39.725 --> 00:19:40.694
Hadlar: You know, Hym...

00:19:40.728 --> 00:19:42.163
Of all my creations,

00:19:42.197 --> 00:19:45.235
I think you
resemble me the most.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.607
[proud chuckle]

00:19:51.849 --> 00:19:53.318
Hadlar: [snarling]

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.757
[roaring]

00:20:12.022 --> 00:20:16.464
[pained grunts]

00:20:24.715 --> 00:20:32.765
Both: [roaring]

00:20:32.798 --> 00:20:35.704
Maam: Then... Then you,
Hym and Sigma...

00:20:35.737 --> 00:20:37.508
you're all
sacrificing yourselves

00:20:37.541 --> 00:20:40.413
in order to grant
Hadlar his final wish?

00:20:40.446 --> 00:20:43.452
You'd really give up
everything for his glory?

00:20:48.095 --> 00:20:50.733
Albinass, let's stop.

00:20:50.767 --> 00:20:53.539
There's no reason for
us to fight.

00:20:53.573 --> 00:20:54.875
No reason?

00:20:54.908 --> 00:20:59.384
Exactly. The way you all
feel about Lord Hadlar...

00:20:59.417 --> 00:21:01.923
it doesn't seem all that
different from how we Disciples

00:21:01.956 --> 00:21:03.058
feel about our friends.

00:21:03.092 --> 00:21:04.762
You and I may be
on different sides,

00:21:04.796 --> 00:21:07.601
but it won't do any good
to destroy each other...

00:21:07.634 --> 00:21:10.607
No matter who wins this
fight, we both lose.

00:21:13.513 --> 00:21:15.483
So, please don't do this.

00:21:15.517 --> 00:21:17.521
If the Royal Guard
care about your leader

00:21:17.554 --> 00:21:19.625
like you say,
this isn't the answer.

00:21:19.659 --> 00:21:21.629
Not when we have
a common enemy.

00:21:21.663 --> 00:21:25.335
If we joined forces, King Vearn
wouldn't stand a chance...

00:21:25.369 --> 00:21:26.872
We'd help.

00:21:33.285 --> 00:21:37.728
Maam? I'm so glad to
hear you feel that way.

00:21:37.761 --> 00:21:39.631
That's a relief.

00:21:39.665 --> 00:21:41.536
I'm glad to know
that you're...

00:21:41.569 --> 00:21:45.376
the kind of naive simpleton
that I despise.

00:21:45.409 --> 00:21:48.649
Now I can kill you
without any mercy!

00:21:52.023 --> 00:21:54.026
Albinass: Needle Thousand!

00:21:57.266 --> 00:22:02.944
[pained cry]

00:23:37.634 --> 00:23:38.937
Narrator: While
the other Disciples

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:40.072
battle the Royal Guard,

00:23:40.105 --> 00:23:43.045
the duel between Dragon Knight
and Dark Lord continues.

00:23:43.078 --> 00:23:44.515
Meanwhile, Maam faces

00:23:44.548 --> 00:23:46.619
a relentless onslaught
from Albinass,

00:23:46.652 --> 00:23:49.390
whose loyalty to
Hadlar fuels her blows.

00:23:49.424 --> 00:23:51.929
Soon Maam finds herself
backed into a corner,

00:23:51.963 --> 00:23:55.002
and her title as a Warrior
Master will be put to the test

00:23:55.035 --> 00:23:57.541
-but can she convince
Albinass to lay down her arms?

00:23:57.574 --> 00:23:59.277
