WEBVTT

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:52.191
[snarling]

00:01:52.225 --> 00:01:56.499
Beast King Anguish Blast!

00:02:02.144 --> 00:02:05.183
Victory!

00:02:06.954 --> 00:02:08.056
Popp: What was that?

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:10.026
That could be Dai and Maam...

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.797
It's not my concern.

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:13.701
Popp: Not anymore.

00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:16.472
It's not my business
whether they live or die.

00:02:16.506 --> 00:02:18.778
Masopho: You're still here?
I'm surprised.

00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:19.646
[startled grunt]

00:02:20.916 --> 00:02:23.787
Wait, you're that Mage from the
fake Hero's party, aren't you?

00:02:24.556 --> 00:02:25.758
Name's Masopho.

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.333
Hey - you're just looting
the place, aren't you?!

00:02:33.473 --> 00:02:35.979
You seem to have a lot
of potential, kid.

00:02:36.012 --> 00:02:39.118
Are you sure you wouldn't
like to join us? Come on.

00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:40.521
No way, old man!

00:02:40.554 --> 00:02:43.059
I am a student
of Avan, the Hero.

00:02:43.092 --> 00:02:46.265
I am not some small-town
crook like you guys.

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.838
Oh, how very interesting.

00:02:48.871 --> 00:02:50.340
So does the famous Avan

00:02:50.373 --> 00:02:54.649
make students of people
who abandon their companions?

00:02:54.682 --> 00:02:58.322
Masopho: Here. Let me show
you how they're doing.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.801
Popp: Dai...
Old man Brass?

00:03:03.835 --> 00:03:05.203
But how?!

00:03:07.876 --> 00:03:11.717
[struggling groans]

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.954
So you both survived.

00:03:17.996 --> 00:03:19.231
D-Dai...

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.613
I'll heal you.

00:03:28.183 --> 00:03:29.184
[struggling grunt]

00:03:29.218 --> 00:03:30.387
No, Maam!

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.892
Well, it looks like
they're in trouble.

00:03:32.926 --> 00:03:37.101
Masopho: Somebody should
help them, don't you think?

00:03:37.134 --> 00:03:40.941
Popp: But, even if I go, what
can I do against Crocodine?

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.312
C'mon!

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.024
Masopho: "A Hero
is one with courage!"

00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:54.736
"And true courage
is not planned for,

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.844
nor does true courage depend on
the strength of one's enemies.

00:03:58.877 --> 00:04:00.280
It's a choice!"

00:04:05.023 --> 00:04:06.258
You like that?

00:04:06.292 --> 00:04:09.733
They aren't my words.
They were my master's.

00:04:09.766 --> 00:04:10.768
Popp: Your master?

00:04:10.801 --> 00:04:11.536
When I was young,

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.574
I also trained
to become a Mage

00:04:13.607 --> 00:04:16.613
and to fight for
justice like you have.

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:19.385
Masopho: But I
couldn't handle it.

00:04:19.418 --> 00:04:21.924
I'd often abandon
my companions

00:04:21.957 --> 00:04:23.694
and run away
from the danger.

00:04:24.228 --> 00:04:27.200
And just look at me now.

00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:28.002
Masopho...

00:04:28.035 --> 00:04:29.806
So, hurry on.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.677
Don't give up while
there's a single,

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.316
solitary shard of
courage left within you.

00:04:39.926 --> 00:04:42.030
Maam: You disgust me!

00:04:44.234 --> 00:04:45.336
[surprised gasps]

00:04:49.746 --> 00:04:51.048
Popp [thought]:
I am disgusting.

00:04:51.081 --> 00:04:54.421
All I ever do is think
of myself and run away...

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.994
Popp [thought]:
Master Avan and Dai

00:04:57.027 --> 00:04:58.664
always risk it all to fight...

00:04:58.697 --> 00:05:00.100
and so will I!

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.872
Well, gang...
That kid is toast.

00:05:02.905 --> 00:05:04.275
The poor thing.

00:05:04.308 --> 00:05:06.680
Nonsense.
He'll be just fine.

00:05:06.713 --> 00:05:10.254
You see... That boy
is a student of Avan.

00:05:10.287 --> 00:05:11.288
Both: What?!

00:05:11.322 --> 00:05:13.460
Avan? You mean
the actual Hero?

00:05:13.493 --> 00:05:17.167
He's made out of
different stuff than us.

00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:19.305
Masopho: [excited chuckle]

00:05:19.338 --> 00:05:20.808
[pained groan]

00:05:24.916 --> 00:05:27.287
Crocodine: A Heyedra?
That means...

00:05:27.321 --> 00:05:29.560
[chuckle]

00:05:29.593 --> 00:05:30.995
Zaboera.

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:32.899
She won't get
in your way now.

00:05:32.932 --> 00:05:36.405
Do it, Crocodine
- finish off the boy.

00:05:39.012 --> 00:05:41.650
[struggling grunts]

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:45.123
Someone... save Dai...

00:05:46.258 --> 00:05:47.394
[pained grunt]

00:05:50.467 --> 00:05:55.476
Now, it finally comes to
an end... with this attack!

00:05:55.912 --> 00:05:57.280
No, Dai!

00:05:57.314 --> 00:05:58.383
Farewell.

00:05:58.416 --> 00:05:59.352
Popp: Stop!

00:05:59.385 --> 00:06:00.554
[surprised grunt]

00:06:08.236 --> 00:06:09.271
It's Popp!

00:06:09.304 --> 00:06:11.643
Crocodine: Ah,
the Mage from before.

00:06:11.676 --> 00:06:15.684
What could someone like you
possibly do by showing up now?

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:17.722
Begone!

00:06:17.755 --> 00:06:21.763
[trembling]

00:06:21.797 --> 00:06:25.403
Popp [thought]: Master Avan,
lend me your courage!

00:06:25.437 --> 00:06:27.709
One fifth - no
- just one tenth

00:06:27.742 --> 00:06:29.979
of what you had
should be enough.

00:06:32.384 --> 00:06:33.887
Popp: How dare you!

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.123
Crocodine: What?

00:06:35.156 --> 00:06:37.896
Popp: I said, how dare you?!

00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:40.199
Leave my friends alone.

00:06:41.468 --> 00:06:45.744
Now, boy; are you sure you
know what you're saying?

00:06:45.778 --> 00:06:47.147
Yes, I am!

00:06:47.181 --> 00:06:52.792
I'm saying I'm going to beat
you myself, you dumb lizard!

00:06:52.826 --> 00:06:54.963
Maam: Popp, whatever
you're planning,

00:06:54.997 --> 00:06:57.467
don't attack that
Lump Shaman! He's...

00:06:57.502 --> 00:07:00.608
Popp: I know.
I recognize him!

00:07:00.641 --> 00:07:02.679
You captured
him from the island

00:07:02.712 --> 00:07:04.649
and turned him
into your servant.

00:07:04.683 --> 00:07:06.586
Y-you dirty fiends!

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.193
Get Crocodine's
Magic Cylinder!

00:07:10.226 --> 00:07:11.162
Popp: Maam!

00:07:11.196 --> 00:07:13.032
Go on and run away.

00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:14.034
Compared to Dai,

00:07:14.068 --> 00:07:17.007
you're nothing more than
a gutless little worm...

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.013
But if you leave now,
I will spare you.

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:23.286
No way!

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:25.758
I am never
abandoning my friends.

00:07:25.791 --> 00:07:28.564
Master Avan did
not train cowards.

00:07:28.597 --> 00:07:29.766
That's right!

00:07:29.799 --> 00:07:32.939
Crocodine! Come and
fight me, one on one!

00:07:32.972 --> 00:07:35.443
Crocodine: A puny
ant like you...

00:07:35.477 --> 00:07:37.682
Popp: I thought I
was a gutless worm.

00:07:37.716 --> 00:07:41.188
Don't tell me you're going to
use a hostage against me, too.

00:07:41.221 --> 00:07:42.526
You watch it.

00:07:42.559 --> 00:07:44.997
Popp: If anyone
here's the worm, it's you.

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.132
Crocodine: Very well.

00:07:46.165 --> 00:07:47.569
If it's death you seek,

00:07:47.602 --> 00:07:50.875
you can go with your
friends to the afterlife!

00:07:50.908 --> 00:07:54.583
Listen. Stay out of
this one, Brass. You hear?

00:07:54.616 --> 00:07:55.751
Popp [thought]: Good.

00:07:55.784 --> 00:07:57.922
Now I can fight without
worrying about him.

00:07:57.955 --> 00:08:00.828
Let's see if my
best spell will work.

00:08:09.344 --> 00:08:12.117
Here I come!

00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:17.394
[roaring]

00:08:17.427 --> 00:08:19.799
[worried cry]

00:08:29.519 --> 00:08:31.624
Wise to distance yourself.

00:08:31.657 --> 00:08:35.130
Because unlike a Hero
or even a Warrior,

00:08:35.163 --> 00:08:38.804
Mages are no different
from a normal human physically.

00:08:38.837 --> 00:08:42.277
One blow from me will send
you straight to the grave.

00:08:43.312 --> 00:08:46.820
Now, you still have a chance,
but it all depends

00:08:46.853 --> 00:08:50.761
on whether the spell
you want to cast works!

00:08:50.794 --> 00:08:55.169
You're about to see for yourself
whether it works or not.

00:09:01.248 --> 00:09:03.252
Kafrizz!

00:09:05.056 --> 00:09:06.025
Did it work?

00:09:06.059 --> 00:09:08.964
[roaring]

00:09:10.233 --> 00:09:11.736
[alarmed gasp]

00:09:11.769 --> 00:09:13.305
Crocodine: Even
if you're a worm,

00:09:13.339 --> 00:09:15.811
you're certainly
Avan's student.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.287
I didn't expect you'd
be able to cast a Kafrizz!

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.723
That said...

00:09:22.792 --> 00:09:26.566
I created a shield of
wind with my Vortex Axe,

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.837
and avoided a direct hit!

00:09:34.148 --> 00:09:36.586
I hope you're ready!

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.924
[roaring]

00:09:42.497 --> 00:09:46.005
[scared yelp]

00:09:46.038 --> 00:09:53.118
[pained groans]

00:09:54.823 --> 00:09:57.360
And that's that, boy.

00:09:57.394 --> 00:10:01.903
Popp [thought]: It hurts...
so bad! I-I'm done for!

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.110
Dai: P-Popp...

00:10:05.143 --> 00:10:06.880
Dai: Run, Popp...

00:10:08.015 --> 00:10:09.151
Dai...

00:10:10.721 --> 00:10:12.324
Popp [thought]:
Don't worry, pal.

00:10:12.357 --> 00:10:14.227
I'm not running anymore!

00:10:17.234 --> 00:10:19.972
Popp [thought]: And I'm
not giving up, either.

00:10:20.006 --> 00:10:23.412
Attacks like these wouldn't
stop you from fighting.

00:10:24.114 --> 00:10:25.150
[struggling grunt]

00:10:25.183 --> 00:10:27.522
[surprised grunt]

00:10:27.555 --> 00:10:30.661
I get knocked down,
but I get up again.

00:10:30.694 --> 00:10:34.434
You're never going
to keep me down!

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:36.104
The boy stands?!

00:10:39.177 --> 00:10:41.282
Popp [thought]: I'll just
have to sacrifice myself

00:10:41.315 --> 00:10:42.952
and do whatever I can!

00:10:42.986 --> 00:10:44.890
Maybe I can't bring
it to a stalemate

00:10:44.923 --> 00:10:46.726
like Master Avan, but...

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.200
Wait... Like
Master Avan? That's it.

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:53.840
I've never pulled it off
before, but I have to try.

00:10:54.341 --> 00:10:56.011
[attacking yell]

00:11:04.863 --> 00:11:08.002
Ridiculous. Have you
lost your mind?

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.275
[agonized groan]

00:11:14.916 --> 00:11:16.753
What are you doing?

00:11:16.786 --> 00:11:20.994
[straining grunts]

00:11:21.596 --> 00:11:22.699
[pained howl]

00:11:22.732 --> 00:11:29.444
[straining grunts]

00:11:29.478 --> 00:11:30.614
[chuckle]

00:11:30.647 --> 00:11:33.186
[pained yell]

00:11:33.219 --> 00:11:35.289
Why do you endure so?

00:11:35.323 --> 00:11:37.628
What can you do with
your rod shattered

00:11:37.661 --> 00:11:40.066
and your Magic
Power all spent?!

00:11:41.302 --> 00:11:44.710
[laughing]

00:11:44.743 --> 00:11:46.478
Why are you laughing?

00:11:46.513 --> 00:11:49.184
Because that was all
part of my plan.

00:11:49.218 --> 00:11:53.561
Shattering my rod and
saving my Magic Power...

00:11:53.594 --> 00:11:54.962
Wait, what?

00:11:57.034 --> 00:12:01.308
Now watch the legendary spell
my master, Avan, excelled at!

00:12:05.182 --> 00:12:06.920
A magic circle?!

00:12:06.953 --> 00:12:12.865
Popp: I hereby banish you,
dark forces... Glimmer!

00:12:41.756 --> 00:12:42.825
[amazed chirp]

00:12:42.859 --> 00:12:46.031
[roaring]

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.536
Huh... What?

00:12:49.271 --> 00:12:50.540
I did it!

00:12:51.643 --> 00:12:52.645
But, how?!

00:12:52.678 --> 00:12:54.047
It can't be!

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.853
Where am I?
What happened to me?

00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:59.825
[alarmed grunt]

00:12:59.859 --> 00:13:01.295
He's back.

00:13:01.328 --> 00:13:02.297
[noticing grunt]

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:03.266
Popp?

00:13:03.299 --> 00:13:06.438
Popp: You were under
the Dark Army's control.

00:13:06.471 --> 00:13:09.378
It was a dirty trick
to use you against Dai.

00:13:09.411 --> 00:13:14.589
Listen, no matter what, you
can't leave that magic circle!

00:13:14.623 --> 00:13:17.595
Use me against Dai? No...

00:13:17.628 --> 00:13:19.197
Brass: Did I?!

00:13:19.231 --> 00:13:20.600
Curse you!

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:24.843
What is this?!

00:13:24.876 --> 00:13:26.513
[chuckling]

00:13:26.546 --> 00:13:27.781
Crocodine: You little...

00:13:27.815 --> 00:13:29.819
[snarling]

00:13:29.852 --> 00:13:32.825
What have you done, boy?
Answer me!

00:13:32.859 --> 00:13:35.531
Popp: It's Glimmer.

00:13:35.564 --> 00:13:40.106
Popp: The spell creates a magic
circle that repels all evil.

00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:44.014
I can't cover an entire
island like Avan can, though.

00:13:44.047 --> 00:13:47.588
You fool! What's the point
in saving Brass now?

00:13:47.621 --> 00:13:49.057
[frustrated grunt]

00:13:49.658 --> 00:13:50.994
[worried yell]

00:13:51.027 --> 00:13:53.667
Face it. You used
a major spell,

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.704
but it was beyond
your abilities,

00:13:55.737 --> 00:13:57.908
and now you're totally spent.

00:13:57.941 --> 00:14:00.479
[weak chuckle]

00:14:02.918 --> 00:14:07.962
It doesn't matter.
Dai is... Dai is still here.

00:14:07.995 --> 00:14:09.665
Dai? So what?

00:14:09.698 --> 00:14:14.140
If old man Brass is okay,
then Dai can fight freely...

00:14:14.174 --> 00:14:17.080
And he'll take
care of you easily.

00:14:17.114 --> 00:14:20.520
He's powerful.
You know that.

00:14:20.554 --> 00:14:25.129
Really? You were willing to
sacrifice yourself for him?

00:14:25.997 --> 00:14:29.003
Popp: Nothing
quite that noble.

00:14:29.037 --> 00:14:33.613
It's not like I
want to die. But...

00:14:33.647 --> 00:14:36.586
Unlike you,
I've still got my pride.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:41.362
And to have to live on after
just abandoning my friends?

00:14:41.395 --> 00:14:42.297
As far as I'm concerned,

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.002
that wouldn't be much
of a life at all!

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.576
Popp [thought]:
Master Avan...

00:14:49.144 --> 00:14:51.014
And besides, dear Popp,

00:14:51.048 --> 00:14:53.352
I believe that the power
we gain through our training

00:14:53.386 --> 00:14:57.360
should always be used to
help others who are in need.

00:14:57.393 --> 00:15:01.135
Popp [thought]: Master...
I think I get it now.

00:15:01.168 --> 00:15:03.506
I'm sorry it took me so long.

00:15:05.209 --> 00:15:06.913
Crocodine [thought]:
This fledging of a boy

00:15:06.946 --> 00:15:09.785
is risking his life to fight.

00:15:09.819 --> 00:15:11.856
And yet, look at me.

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:14.027
I've abandoned
my pride out of fear

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.000
and resorted
to vile treachery.

00:15:17.033 --> 00:15:19.706
Is this truly the way?

00:15:19.739 --> 00:15:24.148
What is victory worth if
it's at the cost of my pride?

00:15:24.181 --> 00:15:27.153
Zaboera: Curses, Crocodine!

00:15:27.186 --> 00:15:31.461
Zaboera: What are you doing?!
Finish the boy off, already!

00:15:33.165 --> 00:15:35.136
Zaboera: Victory
is finally at hand!

00:15:35.169 --> 00:15:36.873
Do you want to lose your seat

00:15:36.906 --> 00:15:40.279
as Legion Commander
over feelings of mercy?!

00:15:45.323 --> 00:15:48.129
[growling]

00:15:48.162 --> 00:15:51.268
Popp, run!
Get out of here!

00:15:51.301 --> 00:15:51.970
[weak groan]

00:15:52.003 --> 00:15:53.874
I can't even stand up.

00:15:53.907 --> 00:15:56.679
Popp: Don't! Stay
inside the magic circle.

00:15:56.713 --> 00:15:57.815
Brass: [frustrated grunt]

00:15:57.849 --> 00:15:59.519
If you step out of there,

00:15:59.552 --> 00:16:03.025
all my energy will
be wasted for nothing.

00:16:03.059 --> 00:16:05.496
It's a tiny magic circle,

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:08.937
but it contains
all of my Magic Power.

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:10.574
Yeah, but, Popp...

00:16:10.607 --> 00:16:12.644
[distressed chirping]

00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:21.529
[distressed chirping]

00:16:24.702 --> 00:16:26.773
No, don't! Don't do it!

00:16:26.806 --> 00:16:30.346
[distressed chirping]

00:16:30.379 --> 00:16:31.850
Forgive me, boy.

00:16:31.883 --> 00:16:34.021
[fearful whimper]

00:16:34.054 --> 00:16:43.071
[sad chirps]

00:16:48.683 --> 00:16:50.386
Stop it! Popp!

00:16:50.921 --> 00:16:52.256
[sad chirps]

00:16:55.429 --> 00:16:56.498
What the...

00:16:58.904 --> 00:16:59.772
He stands?!

00:16:59.805 --> 00:17:01.909
But Dai was all but finished!

00:17:01.942 --> 00:17:04.682
And what on earth
is this light?!

00:17:05.517 --> 00:17:06.351
No way...

00:17:09.391 --> 00:17:10.927
A miracle!

00:17:10.961 --> 00:17:14.400
Dai: Crocodine,
you'll pay for this.

00:17:14.434 --> 00:17:17.140
First you used
my Grampa for evil,

00:17:17.173 --> 00:17:19.778
and then you hurt my friends.

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:24.187
Now you're going down!

00:17:27.761 --> 00:17:30.232
What is this infernal light?!

00:17:30.734 --> 00:17:33.806
[shrieking]

00:17:37.915 --> 00:17:38.850
Popp: Maam!

00:17:39.919 --> 00:17:42.524
A mark on his forehead!
What is that?!

00:17:53.513 --> 00:17:54.516
[determined roar]

00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:55.551
Come on!

00:17:55.584 --> 00:17:58.856
Enough. Take this!

00:18:01.028 --> 00:18:02.732
Crocodine: Impossible!

00:18:02.765 --> 00:18:10.312
[straining grunts]

00:18:11.515 --> 00:18:12.483
[shocked gasp]

00:18:16.826 --> 00:18:18.563
Come on, Maam.
Hang in there!

00:18:19.532 --> 00:18:20.266
Popp...

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:22.571
Wh-What kind of power is this?

00:18:22.605 --> 00:18:24.074
I don't really know.

00:18:24.107 --> 00:18:27.915
It must be some
hidden ability of his.

00:18:27.948 --> 00:18:29.451
As far as I can tell,

00:18:29.484 --> 00:18:33.492
that strange mark
responds to Dai's anger.

00:18:33.526 --> 00:18:37.266
Popp: And right now,
he must be truly angry.

00:18:38.201 --> 00:18:40.406
I think he's about
to explode...

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.845
After all the
Dark Army's schemes.

00:18:42.878 --> 00:18:46.351
Crocodine [thought]:
Is this Dai's true power...

00:18:46.385 --> 00:18:50.894
the power that forced
Lord Hadlar to retreat?

00:18:50.927 --> 00:18:57.574
If I lose, then what have
I thrown my pride away for?

00:18:57.607 --> 00:19:02.684
I must win even
if it destroys me!

00:19:02.718 --> 00:19:04.187
Beast King Anguish Blast!

00:19:04.221 --> 00:19:06.726
Oh, no. Dai's
completely unarmed!

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:11.836
Here's a Heal. You should
be able to run now.

00:19:12.269 --> 00:19:13.607
Go and help Dai!

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.508
Right!

00:19:14.542 --> 00:19:21.522
[roaring]

00:19:21.556 --> 00:19:25.564
Your body may be like steel,
but at such close range,

00:19:25.597 --> 00:19:28.836
there's no chance
that you'll overcome me.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:32.577
With my greatest attack,
I send you to the afterlife!

00:19:32.611 --> 00:19:33.679
Hey - Dai!

00:19:34.682 --> 00:19:35.784
Use this!

00:19:42.631 --> 00:19:46.672
Do it now, Dai!
Master's special attack!

00:19:50.146 --> 00:19:54.487
Beast King Anguish Blast!

00:19:55.189 --> 00:20:01.802
Avan Strash!

00:20:19.437 --> 00:20:22.009
Crocodine:
"Avan Strash," was it?

00:20:23.412 --> 00:20:27.621
An impressive attack.
You... W-win.

00:20:28.322 --> 00:20:30.794
[defeated gurgle]

00:20:31.596 --> 00:20:32.697
Yes!

00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:35.136
Crocodine: [chuckle]

00:20:35.169 --> 00:20:37.574
If losing was always my fate,

00:20:37.607 --> 00:20:40.513
I wish that I'd fought
you fair and square.

00:20:40.547 --> 00:20:41.782
Crocodine?

00:20:41.816 --> 00:20:43.252
You, boy!

00:20:43.285 --> 00:20:44.655
Crocodine: Well done.

00:20:44.689 --> 00:20:49.598
You taught me a lesson...
on how valuable pride really is.

00:20:49.631 --> 00:20:53.405
If my defeat is at the
hands of ones such as you,

00:20:53.438 --> 00:20:55.343
I have no regrets.

00:20:55.376 --> 00:20:57.647
As a matter of fact,
I'm proud.

00:20:57.681 --> 00:21:03.526
I was so obsessed with
victory. I was a fool!

00:21:09.104 --> 00:21:11.742
This is farewell, Dai.

00:21:12.744 --> 00:21:14.447
Don't ever lose.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.453
A Hero must always
remain strong!

00:21:19.357 --> 00:21:24.200
[roaring]

00:21:24.233 --> 00:21:25.435
[surprised gasps]

00:21:26.839 --> 00:21:28.008
[surprised gasps]

00:21:30.947 --> 00:21:32.617
[fleeing cries]

00:21:37.393 --> 00:21:40.432
Incompetent fool.
How could he lose?

00:21:40.465 --> 00:21:42.938
Zaboera [thought]: But what
was that astonishing power

00:21:42.971 --> 00:21:44.274
the boy wielded?

00:21:44.307 --> 00:21:45.910
And that mark?

00:21:45.944 --> 00:21:49.885
I must inform Lord Hadlar
of the situation.

00:21:50.621 --> 00:21:52.190
[cheering]

00:21:52.223 --> 00:21:53.759
Dai [thought]:
Crocodine...

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.129
Dai...

00:21:55.162 --> 00:21:56.431
You won.

00:23:38.502 --> 00:23:40.507
Narrator: With Beast
King Crocodine defeated,

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.978
Dai and his friends
head to Papnica Kingdom.

00:23:43.012 --> 00:23:45.617
There, they discover
a terrible truth,

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:47.654
and while they search
for Princess Leona,

00:23:47.687 --> 00:23:50.794
the party is ambushed
by undead monsters.

00:23:50.827 --> 00:23:51.962
But just then,

00:23:51.995 --> 00:23:55.135
a mysterious warrior with
an ominous blade intervenes.

00:23:56.204 --> 00:23:57.775
Learn his identity
