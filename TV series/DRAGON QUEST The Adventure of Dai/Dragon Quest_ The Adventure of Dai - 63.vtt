WEBVTT

00:01:50.554 --> 00:01:53.193
[startled yells]

00:01:53.226 --> 00:01:55.230
Head back to
the stairs. Hurry!

00:01:55.263 --> 00:02:02.712
[falling yells]

00:02:07.288 --> 00:02:09.092
Is everyone all right?

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:10.194
Fine.

00:02:10.227 --> 00:02:12.031
I think I'm okay.

00:02:12.064 --> 00:02:13.867
Well, that's good.

00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:19.445
Now we have another
problem, don't we?

00:02:21.148 --> 00:02:23.520
Our ten hours are already up.

00:02:23.554 --> 00:02:27.294
We're going to have to find
our way back to the surface.

00:02:27.328 --> 00:02:30.501
No, Queen Flora. I think
we should keep going.

00:02:30.535 --> 00:02:31.135
Huh?

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:32.204
Seriously?

00:02:32.237 --> 00:02:33.340
Think about it.

00:02:33.373 --> 00:02:34.943
We don't know how
far down we've fallen...

00:02:34.977 --> 00:02:38.617
We can't know if we'll make
it out of here in time.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.322
So let's take our chances
and find the Kaglimmer.

00:02:41.356 --> 00:02:42.592
If we don't find it,

00:02:42.625 --> 00:02:44.696
we'll have even less time
to reach the surface.

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:47.034
And if we do, then it
changes everything.

00:02:47.067 --> 00:02:48.504
We could use our Insignias...

00:02:48.537 --> 00:02:51.409
And boost the Kaglimmer's effect
to fight the cave's Malice.

00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:55.518
Then Queen Flora can cast her
Evac spell and we'll escape.

00:02:55.551 --> 00:02:58.056
It would still take
nothing short of a miracle

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:59.926
for that whole plan to work.

00:03:01.162 --> 00:03:02.966
We want to defeat
King Vearn...

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:04.536
and doing that is
going to take

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.207
an even bigger
miracle than this.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.078
So, why don't we
get some practice

00:03:09.111 --> 00:03:11.482
and pull off a
smaller miracle first?

00:03:23.306 --> 00:03:26.011
There's no time to fight.
Let's get moving.

00:03:26.045 --> 00:03:28.049
Come on, everybody.
We can do this!

00:03:28.082 --> 00:03:28.651
Flora: Right!

00:03:28.685 --> 00:03:29.519
Yes!

00:03:30.387 --> 00:03:32.090
Flora [thought]:
Such a strong will...

00:03:32.124 --> 00:03:34.630
I'm glad I was right
about you, Leona.

00:03:34.663 --> 00:03:37.334
With a clear head,
your words have the power to

00:03:37.368 --> 00:03:40.173
inspire others and
give them strength-

00:03:40.206 --> 00:03:42.879
and that's exactly
why I chose you.

00:03:45.818 --> 00:03:48.423
Ten hours left...

00:03:48.456 --> 00:03:52.799
If we stay focused, I know
we can find the spell.

00:03:55.036 --> 00:03:58.276
Avan... Strash!

00:04:00.882 --> 00:04:02.819
[roaring]

00:04:11.136 --> 00:04:12.505
Excellent!

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:15.010
You've learned how to unleash
a rapid-fire assault with

00:04:15.043 --> 00:04:16.379
the Arrow Type.

00:04:16.412 --> 00:04:17.516
It is powerful...

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.552
But I still don't
think it'll be enough to

00:04:19.586 --> 00:04:21.857
counter Vearn's
Kaiser Phoenix.

00:04:21.891 --> 00:04:22.926
Last time we fought,

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:25.531
I barely pierced it using
the Break-Type Strash,

00:04:25.564 --> 00:04:27.969
and it's more powerful
than the Arrow-Type.

00:04:28.003 --> 00:04:29.506
Now that I don't
have my sword,

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:33.112
I can't amplify attacks with
my Draconic Aura like before.

00:04:33.146 --> 00:04:34.649
So if I want to beat him,

00:04:34.682 --> 00:04:37.487
I need an attack that's
as fast as the Arrow-Type,

00:04:37.521 --> 00:04:39.826
and as powerful
as the Break-Type.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:43.667
What is it?

00:04:43.701 --> 00:04:47.542
Dai: Nova, stand right
there, okay? Get ready.

00:04:49.612 --> 00:04:53.320
I think I might have invented
a brand-new attack just now!

00:04:53.353 --> 00:04:55.591
A new one? Is that possible?

00:04:56.626 --> 00:04:58.029
C'mon. Are you
telling me there's

00:04:58.063 --> 00:05:01.436
a third type of Avan Strash
that's not in the book?

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:03.006
Dai: It's nothing
that impressive...

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:05.009
But I want to try.

00:05:05.043 --> 00:05:08.383
Now conjure your Aura Blade
at full power, got it?

00:05:08.416 --> 00:05:10.588
Uh... I guess so.

00:05:12.324 --> 00:05:13.760
Bring it on.

00:05:17.502 --> 00:05:18.804
Nova [thought]:
That looks exactly like

00:05:18.837 --> 00:05:21.744
the stance he was
already using.

00:05:21.777 --> 00:05:23.614
But, wait...

00:05:31.395 --> 00:05:33.634
Dai: Here we go!

00:05:56.212 --> 00:05:57.748
Are you out of your mind?

00:05:58.951 --> 00:06:01.690
If I hadn't reinforced
my weapon with Aura,

00:06:01.723 --> 00:06:03.493
that would've taken my
head clean off!

00:06:03.527 --> 00:06:05.865
Sorry... My bad.

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:07.300
But it really works!

00:06:07.334 --> 00:06:09.371
It's only a small
part of our arsenal,

00:06:09.404 --> 00:06:12.411
but we've got a
totally new power.

00:06:12.444 --> 00:06:14.916
Nova: "A small part"?
That's ridiculous.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.421
If you ask me, you've
just created an attack

00:06:17.454 --> 00:06:19.358
that'll blow the
others out of the water.

00:06:19.392 --> 00:06:20.460
That was incredible.

00:06:20.494 --> 00:06:22.030
Yeah? You think so?

00:06:23.501 --> 00:06:25.671
You never cease to amaze.

00:06:25.705 --> 00:06:29.145
I cannot believe I used
to think I could rival you.

00:06:29.178 --> 00:06:30.113
[chuckling]

00:06:30.147 --> 00:06:31.617
It's not that great.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.288
And besides, my timing
is still way off.

00:06:34.322 --> 00:06:35.157
For now...

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.227
So let's keep training.

00:06:37.261 --> 00:06:39.766
Here it comes -
watch your head!

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:41.101
[charing roar]

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.606
Flora: This must be
the twenty-fifth level.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.577
The Kaglimmer will
be in this chamber-

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.547
prepare yourself, Leona.

00:07:14.168 --> 00:07:15.805
I sense a strange power...

00:07:15.838 --> 00:07:18.009
coming from that
platform in the middle.

00:07:18.043 --> 00:07:21.783
Flora: The ritual altar,
where the spell resides.

00:07:24.488 --> 00:07:26.058
So I just pray in here?

00:07:26.092 --> 00:07:29.298
Flora: That's right.
You should wear your Insignia.

00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:31.001
Okay, um...

00:07:37.414 --> 00:07:38.784
Here goes.

00:07:44.295 --> 00:07:45.731
Flora: Are you ready?

00:07:45.765 --> 00:07:46.733
Yes.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.077
Merle: Monsters
are closing in.

00:07:53.246 --> 00:07:55.551
Well, well. What a surprise.

00:07:56.018 --> 00:07:57.321
Princess...

00:07:57.354 --> 00:07:59.491
The three of us will
handle the monsters.

00:07:59.526 --> 00:08:00.929
Focus on the ritual.

00:08:00.962 --> 00:08:02.030
Right!

00:08:09.044 --> 00:08:10.079
Here they come.

00:08:14.856 --> 00:08:16.659
[roaring]

00:08:25.978 --> 00:08:27.047
[chuckling]

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.282
Come on!

00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:37.935
Maam, there's more!

00:08:38.403 --> 00:08:42.812
[snarling]

00:08:42.845 --> 00:08:44.782
Maam: Now this is
a welcoming party.

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:46.485
Merle: Why are there
so many monsters

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.391
living in a cave built
by the God of Humanity?

00:08:49.424 --> 00:08:50.928
According to
the ancient texts,

00:08:50.962 --> 00:08:52.966
the Sage who explored
the area believed that

00:08:52.999 --> 00:08:55.571
the lowest level of
the Cave of Trials...

00:08:55.604 --> 00:08:57.775
connects right to
the Underworld.

00:08:58.978 --> 00:09:00.981
Maam: You're not
getting any closer!

00:09:05.423 --> 00:09:06.926
Leona, hurry.

00:09:11.603 --> 00:09:14.307
The Ritual of
Inheritance has begun.

00:09:19.084 --> 00:09:21.823
Hear me... Great
God of Humanity...

00:09:21.857 --> 00:09:24.596
and allow me to wield
this legendary spell-

00:09:24.629 --> 00:09:26.700
this unparalleled
word of strength,

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:30.373
imbued with all of
your holy power...

00:09:30.406 --> 00:09:32.310
Now, Kaglimmer!

00:09:33.947 --> 00:09:35.951
[screaming]

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:37.888
Leona!

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.260
It's burning her!

00:09:40.293 --> 00:09:43.098
We mustn't stop her now -
it's not real fire.

00:09:43.132 --> 00:09:46.573
Flora: It's pure spiritual
energy... a flame of the soul.

00:09:46.606 --> 00:09:47.908
Merle: You mean...
it's an illusion?

00:09:47.942 --> 00:09:49.478
-Flora: No, it's real.
-Leona: [agonized cry]

00:09:49.512 --> 00:09:53.452
This must be some sort of test
left by the God of Humanity.

00:09:53.485 --> 00:09:55.591
If Leona's
spirit is unworthy of

00:09:55.624 --> 00:09:57.093
the Kaglimmer spell...

00:09:57.127 --> 00:10:02.036
These flames will incinerate
her, to "purify" the altar.

00:10:02.538 --> 00:10:03.907
Oh, no.

00:10:05.343 --> 00:10:07.080
Don't give up!

00:10:07.114 --> 00:10:08.249
Stand strong, Leona.

00:10:08.283 --> 00:10:10.319
I know that your
soul is pure.

00:10:42.719 --> 00:10:45.824
God of Humans: You who seek
the Kaglimmer spell...

00:10:45.858 --> 00:10:49.833
Present your soul and
prove you are worthy.

00:10:49.866 --> 00:10:52.605
My soul... What do you mean?

00:10:52.638 --> 00:10:54.542
God of Humans: The Great
Purification spell

00:10:54.575 --> 00:10:57.782
requires a user with
an unblemished spirit.

00:10:57.815 --> 00:11:00.621
Tell me, is your soul pure?

00:11:00.654 --> 00:11:02.859
Do you have a purpose
worthy of wielding

00:11:02.892 --> 00:11:04.762
such great power?

00:11:04.796 --> 00:11:07.067
I don't know if
I have an answer...

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.471
It's a difficult
question, mighty lord.

00:11:09.506 --> 00:11:10.675
'Cause deep down...

00:11:10.708 --> 00:11:12.010
There's only one reason

00:11:12.043 --> 00:11:14.983
I can offer for seeking
the spell's power.

00:11:15.016 --> 00:11:17.221
It's that in my heart I know.

00:11:17.254 --> 00:11:20.861
In the world where
I was born... My home.

00:11:20.894 --> 00:11:25.036
That my people - they need
my help now more than ever!

00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:27.074
Leona: I don't want
this power for myself,

00:11:27.107 --> 00:11:29.612
but I must prove that
everything we've fought for...

00:11:29.645 --> 00:11:31.717
And the privileges
we've inherited-

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.954
that we still
earned our place here.

00:11:33.987 --> 00:11:38.195
I need this power.
So, please!

00:11:52.257 --> 00:11:53.694
The flames are lifting!

00:11:53.727 --> 00:11:55.631
That light...
W-What is that light?

00:11:55.664 --> 00:12:00.407
That is her desire... to seek
out justice and find truth.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.979
That is Leona's essence.

00:12:03.012 --> 00:12:06.351
We're witnessing
the light of her soul.

00:12:11.863 --> 00:12:15.102
Everyone, come here
and join hands.

00:12:30.768 --> 00:12:32.303
Kaglimmer!

00:12:38.583 --> 00:12:40.654
A pillar of light!
What is that?

00:12:40.687 --> 00:12:42.591
It must be Leona.
She really did it!

00:12:42.624 --> 00:12:44.127
Let's head back.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.275
Popp: Donk!

00:13:16.593 --> 00:13:18.262
It's no use.

00:13:18.295 --> 00:13:21.368
No matter how much
Magic Power I put into it...

00:13:21.401 --> 00:13:24.374
No matter how much
I punish myself...

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.884
No matter what I try...

00:13:28.918 --> 00:13:31.856
I just can't make it glow.

00:13:49.324 --> 00:13:52.097
[defeated chuckle]

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:53.733
Well, that settles it.

00:13:53.767 --> 00:13:56.305
Avan made a mistake
when he chose me.

00:13:56.338 --> 00:13:58.943
Dai's father was
a Dragon Knight...

00:13:58.977 --> 00:14:01.883
Leona is the
Princess of Papnica...

00:14:01.916 --> 00:14:04.087
Maam's parents were
the Warrior and Cleric

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.227
in Master Avan's own party...

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.062
[sniffling]

00:14:08.096 --> 00:14:09.398
And Hyunckel's a swordsman

00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:12.739
who's been training
ever since he was a kid...

00:14:12.772 --> 00:14:15.376
Taught by good and evil.

00:14:16.011 --> 00:14:17.313
Then there's me.

00:14:17.346 --> 00:14:20.186
I'm the only one
that's different.

00:14:22.991 --> 00:14:26.899
I'm just...
just... normal.

00:14:45.369 --> 00:14:47.608
Matoriv: Will you
spit it out, Popp?

00:14:47.641 --> 00:14:49.912
Don't just sit there moping.

00:14:49.945 --> 00:14:51.248
I mean, it's
pretty obvious that

00:14:51.282 --> 00:14:53.953
you came here
looking for advice.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.126
So, what is it?

00:14:59.431 --> 00:15:01.067
Well, I...

00:15:06.712 --> 00:15:08.015
Just forget it.

00:15:08.049 --> 00:15:10.988
You may be my mentor,
but this is... well...

00:15:11.021 --> 00:15:13.192
Is the word you're
looking for "pointless"?

00:15:13.225 --> 00:15:14.995
How am I supposed
to give advice

00:15:15.029 --> 00:15:16.766
when you won't
even talk, huh?

00:15:16.799 --> 00:15:20.039
It's not as if
I'm a Seer, you know.

00:15:20.072 --> 00:15:21.676
Popp: Yes, I know.

00:15:22.945 --> 00:15:24.615
But I also know
that your advice

00:15:24.649 --> 00:15:26.953
won't fix what's
troubling me...

00:15:26.987 --> 00:15:29.425
So like I said,
just forget it.

00:15:29.458 --> 00:15:32.932
I guess... This is
my own problem to solve.

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:35.403
Although...
I'm almost certain

00:15:35.436 --> 00:15:38.108
there's nothing I can
do about it, either.

00:15:38.142 --> 00:15:41.550
I'm an unimportant
son of a blacksmith,

00:15:41.583 --> 00:15:43.954
and it seems like
I've finally hit a wall

00:15:43.987 --> 00:15:46.225
that I can't climb over.

00:15:46.258 --> 00:15:49.733
I guess that's it.
End of story.

00:15:49.766 --> 00:15:51.637
Useless. And what's more...

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:52.772
I don't want to become

00:15:52.805 --> 00:15:55.276
a colossal burden
on everybody else.

00:15:55.309 --> 00:15:59.384
And I... I don't know
what to do anymore, okay?!

00:15:59.418 --> 00:16:03.760
That is why I'm here.
Do you have any advice?

00:16:05.898 --> 00:16:09.437
Matoriv: [laughing]

00:16:09.471 --> 00:16:13.814
Sorry, kid. I'm actually
a little bit flattered.

00:16:13.847 --> 00:16:15.617
Y-you're... what?

00:16:15.651 --> 00:16:16.686
Listen up.

00:16:16.719 --> 00:16:19.491
I have no idea what it is
you're going through...

00:16:19.526 --> 00:16:22.097
But to see the useless
little brat I trained

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.969
finally shake off
the wet behind his ears

00:16:25.002 --> 00:16:27.641
and reach this level
after all this time?

00:16:27.674 --> 00:16:31.148
Well, it makes me happy
and sad at the same time.

00:16:31.181 --> 00:16:34.655
It's a strange sensation-
like I'm all tingly inside.

00:16:34.689 --> 00:16:35.957
Never had a wife or a kid,

00:16:35.991 --> 00:16:39.632
but I suspect this is what it
must feel like to be a parent.

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:41.468
Popp: Mentor...

00:16:41.502 --> 00:16:43.707
Matoriv: To tell you
the very strange truth,

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.410
now that I've
taught you Medroa,

00:16:45.443 --> 00:16:48.650
you've probably
surpassed me in combat.

00:16:48.683 --> 00:16:52.156
If there was such a thing
as an Insignia of Matoriv,

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:54.562
I'd have given
it to you ages ago.

00:16:54.595 --> 00:16:58.302
[amused laughter]

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.176
What now?

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:03.914
Popp: It's nothing.

00:17:03.947 --> 00:17:05.851
Sorry for whining
like that, Mentor.

00:17:05.884 --> 00:17:09.659
I'll... I'll go
figure this out myself.

00:17:09.692 --> 00:17:13.299
Before you leave...
There's one more thing.

00:17:13.332 --> 00:17:16.706
This is the last piece
of advice I have for you.

00:17:16.739 --> 00:17:18.943
Popp [thought]: "The last"?

00:17:18.977 --> 00:17:21.448
Believe in yourself.

00:17:21.481 --> 00:17:24.121
Popp [thought]:
What's there to believe in?

00:17:24.154 --> 00:17:26.325
Matoriv: If you were
just some spoiled brat,

00:17:26.358 --> 00:17:28.663
you never would
have made it this far.

00:17:28.697 --> 00:17:29.798
It's because you're

00:17:29.832 --> 00:17:32.136
an "unimportant
son of a blacksmith"

00:17:32.169 --> 00:17:34.274
that you looked up
to Avan so much,

00:17:34.308 --> 00:17:37.046
and struggled harder
than anybody else.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.284
Give yourself some credit.

00:17:39.318 --> 00:17:41.690
You're stronger
than you think.

00:17:41.723 --> 00:17:43.793
And I'm so very proud...

00:17:43.826 --> 00:17:46.464
That you were
my humble student.

00:17:46.966 --> 00:17:48.703
[sniffling]

00:17:54.815 --> 00:17:56.218
Matoriv: Believe it or not,

00:17:56.251 --> 00:18:00.861
I'm pretty sure I do know what
you're going through, Popp.

00:18:00.894 --> 00:18:02.531
Matoriv [thought]:
Make no mistake,

00:18:02.564 --> 00:18:06.405
this will probably be the
biggest hurdle of your life.

00:18:06.438 --> 00:18:09.712
But... if you can figure
out how to overcome it...

00:18:09.745 --> 00:18:11.115
There's a good chance

00:18:11.148 --> 00:18:13.452
you'll make it
further than I ever did-

00:18:13.485 --> 00:18:16.726
and I hope I'm around
when that day comes.

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:20.265
[coughing]

00:18:24.374 --> 00:18:25.443
Flora: We have successfully

00:18:25.476 --> 00:18:27.882
attained the great
Kaglimmer spell!

00:18:27.915 --> 00:18:31.421
[excited cheering]

00:18:31.454 --> 00:18:33.325
Flora: Now, we must
proceed with our plan

00:18:33.358 --> 00:18:35.462
to rescue Hyunckel
and Crocodine,

00:18:35.496 --> 00:18:38.269
after which the Hero's
party shall infiltrate

00:18:38.302 --> 00:18:40.640
Vearn Palace together.

00:18:40.674 --> 00:18:42.644
[cheering]

00:18:42.677 --> 00:18:45.850
Popp [thought]: The Princess
made it back safely, huh?

00:18:45.884 --> 00:18:47.554
I knew you could
do it, Leona!

00:18:47.587 --> 00:18:51.563
It was actually pretty easy.
Am I right, ladies?

00:18:51.596 --> 00:18:53.432
[uneasy chuckles]

00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:55.971
Now that you've proven
your soul is worthy,

00:18:56.004 --> 00:18:58.442
the Mysticite in your
Insignia of Avan

00:18:58.476 --> 00:19:00.480
should glow just
like the others.

00:19:00.514 --> 00:19:01.381
Great!

00:19:06.726 --> 00:19:07.928
Popp [thought]: Hear that?

00:19:07.961 --> 00:19:12.103
Leona's a royal princess and
even she's giving it her all.

00:19:12.136 --> 00:19:13.607
I can't give up.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.712
I'll push myself harder
than ever before!

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:22.625
How about you, Dai?

00:19:22.658 --> 00:19:25.263
Did all of your extra
training go well?

00:19:25.296 --> 00:19:27.568
Better than we ever
could have expected-

00:19:27.601 --> 00:19:29.104
Dai here invented
a new attack

00:19:29.137 --> 00:19:30.975
without even
breaking a sweat.

00:19:31.008 --> 00:19:32.812
Leona: Wow, that's amazing!

00:19:32.845 --> 00:19:34.247
[bashful chuckle]

00:19:34.281 --> 00:19:36.953
Dai: Now all I need is
a sword that's able to

00:19:36.987 --> 00:19:38.656
channel my Draconic Aura.

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:42.230
I see. Now if only we
still had the Sword of Dai.

00:19:42.263 --> 00:19:44.769
Your Majesty! We got trouble.

00:19:44.802 --> 00:19:47.841
A Darkling has just been
spotted approaching the Fort!

00:19:47.875 --> 00:19:50.245
What? Is it Lord Hadlar?!

00:19:56.191 --> 00:19:57.393
Hold on!

00:19:57.426 --> 00:19:59.464
That Darkling's not an enemy.

00:20:03.038 --> 00:20:04.975
This is a rather
hostile welcome.

00:20:05.009 --> 00:20:07.146
Baduck: Indeed!
I say we turn around

00:20:07.179 --> 00:20:09.284
if this is the kinda
thanks we're gonna get!

00:20:09.318 --> 00:20:10.653
Hey there, you guys!

00:20:10.687 --> 00:20:13.560
At ease! Out of
the way, you fools.

00:20:13.593 --> 00:20:15.095
Ah, Princess.

00:20:15.129 --> 00:20:17.166
Why aren't you a
sight for sore eyes.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.336
[giggling]

00:20:18.369 --> 00:20:20.908
The Dark King used
the staff, didn't he?

00:20:20.941 --> 00:20:22.878
Yeah. The Staff of Edacity.

00:20:22.911 --> 00:20:25.717
Is it true? Did you
really make that thing?

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:28.222
I did. And with
such a weapon in hand,

00:20:28.255 --> 00:20:30.593
Vearn is truly unstoppable.

00:20:30.627 --> 00:20:34.868
In even combat, I doubt you
stand a chance against him.

00:20:34.902 --> 00:20:36.939
It's simply too powerful.

00:20:36.973 --> 00:20:38.241
That's why I'm here.

00:20:38.275 --> 00:20:41.381
Speaking of, how did you
manage to find us out here?

00:20:41.415 --> 00:20:43.418
Your friend gave
me directions.

00:20:43.452 --> 00:20:45.623
Wait a minute!
You mean - that's...

00:20:46.592 --> 00:20:48.162
Lon Beruk: The one and only.

00:20:48.195 --> 00:20:50.266
It returned to me
after we lost you,

00:20:50.299 --> 00:20:53.540
along with Hyunckel's
Dark Armor Spear.

00:20:53.573 --> 00:20:57.413
Both of these weapons sought
me out because they sensed

00:20:57.446 --> 00:21:01.188
they would require more
power for the battle ahead...

00:21:01.221 --> 00:21:04.293
So gladly I
heeded their plea.

00:21:14.014 --> 00:21:19.290
I present... the newly
reborn, mighty Sword of Dai.

00:21:22.063 --> 00:21:24.066
May I draw it, sir?

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.872
You will have
to ask it yourself.

00:21:31.749 --> 00:21:35.122
Dai [thought]: You feel
even stronger than before.

00:21:35.155 --> 00:21:37.694
I sure have missed having you.

00:21:37.728 --> 00:21:41.367
What do you say, my friend?
Ready for another fight?

00:23:37.667 --> 00:23:39.003
Narrator: With an
all new attack

00:23:39.036 --> 00:23:41.609
and his blade fortified
thanks to Lon Beruk,

00:23:41.643 --> 00:23:44.515
Dai's hope of defeating
King Vearn is renewed.

00:23:44.548 --> 00:23:46.484
But while the
Hero's morale is high,

00:23:46.519 --> 00:23:48.522
Maam and Amy find
themselves at odds,

00:23:48.556 --> 00:23:50.259
and Popp continues to
struggle with unleashing

00:23:50.293 --> 00:23:52.262
the power of his Insignia.

00:23:52.296 --> 00:23:55.670
As the battle draws near,
tensions reach a fever pitch,

00:23:55.703 --> 00:23:57.607
and there's no telling
who will explode...

00:23:57.641 --> 00:23:59.344
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:59.377 --> 00:24:01.381
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:01.414 --> 00:24:03.451
"The Night Before the Battle".
