WEBVTT

00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:54.629
Baran: No, I will.

00:01:56.634 --> 00:02:01.076
Or does anyone here think
my son and I will not be enough?

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:02.277
Popp [thought]: Huh?!

00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:04.883
That's the most powerful
tag team in the world!

00:02:04.917 --> 00:02:08.056
Why are you willing to
help us now, General Baran?

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:09.860
Crocodine: I can explain that.

00:02:09.893 --> 00:02:11.763
But first things first.

00:02:11.797 --> 00:02:13.901
Hyunckel requires healing.

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:15.236
All: Hyunckel!

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:32.673
Leona: I see.

00:02:32.706 --> 00:02:34.909
You've realized that
defeating King Vearn

00:02:34.943 --> 00:02:38.216
is in everyone's
best interest...

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:41.455
Then we will gladly
accept your assistance.

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.862
Now, Dai; you and
Baran should head to

00:02:43.895 --> 00:02:45.130
the Dark Citadel Gate.

00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:46.667
Dai: Leona...
I can do it myself.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.673
And Merle; Could you
please heal Crocodine?

00:02:49.706 --> 00:02:50.307
Right.

00:02:50.341 --> 00:02:52.244
Popp, Maam, and Crocodine.

00:02:52.277 --> 00:02:54.048
Once preparations
are complete,

00:02:54.081 --> 00:02:56.052
you will take on
the Royal Guard. Okay?

00:02:56.085 --> 00:02:57.021
-Popp: Okay!
-Maam: Great!

00:02:57.054 --> 00:02:58.422
Dai: Leona!

00:02:58.456 --> 00:03:01.096
Is there anything that the
two of you are going to need?

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.600
No. When everyone is ready,

00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:05.805
we'll make our
way to the gate.

00:03:05.838 --> 00:03:07.942
Do you understand, Dino?

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:32.658
Popp: Good grief.

00:03:32.692 --> 00:03:36.099
He's been pouting ever since
we left the camp in Zababa.

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:38.638
They haven't said
a word to each other.

00:03:38.671 --> 00:03:40.473
Will they be okay?

00:03:40.508 --> 00:03:42.477
With a little bit of luck.

00:03:42.512 --> 00:03:44.817
So far we've managed
to avoid another

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.823
destructive battle
between the two of them.

00:03:47.856 --> 00:03:50.928
And what's more,
it may only be temporary,

00:03:50.962 --> 00:03:53.534
but it seems like Baran
is finally on our side.

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:56.606
Well, we'll see if he
earns his keep, won't we?

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.111
This is my first
time seeing him.

00:03:59.145 --> 00:04:01.215
I can't believe
that guy over there

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:03.052
is the one from
your stories.

00:04:03.085 --> 00:04:06.760
I can sense an overwhelming
power somewhere in him...

00:04:06.793 --> 00:04:10.367
But he doesn't seem like the
violent monster you described.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.340
Don't forget - the last
time we fought didn't exactly

00:04:13.373 --> 00:04:16.112
set a very good mood
for working together.

00:04:16.145 --> 00:04:18.216
You can say that again.

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:20.955
Crocodine: Well, now
we can thank Hyunckel.

00:04:20.988 --> 00:04:22.859
He risked everything he had

00:04:22.893 --> 00:04:25.564
to reach an
understanding with Baran.

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:29.939
And it came at a very
high price. You all saw it.

00:04:29.973 --> 00:04:32.679
Amy: It's better this way.

00:04:32.712 --> 00:04:34.583
Hyunckel threw himself
into every fight

00:04:34.616 --> 00:04:37.054
with the belief that
his own life didn't matter,

00:04:37.087 --> 00:04:38.624
that he wouldn't be missed.

00:04:38.657 --> 00:04:42.398
And after this,
he... he might change.

00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:46.606
Honestly, he does need to
learn how to take it easy.

00:04:48.945 --> 00:04:51.883
Dino... I mean, Dai.

00:04:55.424 --> 00:04:57.595
Baran: There's no
need to be on edge.

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:01.235
I am on your side for now,
for this one task.

00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:07.148
Until we do away with the Dark
King Vearn once and for all.

00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:08.383
And when that's over,

00:05:08.416 --> 00:05:11.488
the two of us are
still destined to fight.

00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:17.233
This silence will only
complicate our mission.

00:05:17.267 --> 00:05:19.973
So speak your
mind while you can.

00:05:21.777 --> 00:05:24.983
Dai: There's one
thing... I want to ask.

00:05:25.016 --> 00:05:26.352
And that is?

00:05:27.822 --> 00:05:32.097
Dai: My... My mother...
What was she like?

00:05:37.007 --> 00:05:38.376
Your mother...

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:40.447
My Soala...

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.085
She was the most beautiful.

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:44.388
And kind.

00:05:44.421 --> 00:05:47.028
Kind to a fault, you'd say.

00:05:47.061 --> 00:05:48.664
Just her mere presence

00:05:48.698 --> 00:05:51.703
filled everyone around
her with warmth and joy.

00:05:51.736 --> 00:05:54.776
She was the sun that
brought light into my life.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.018
I doubt I'll love
anyone so deeply...

00:05:59.051 --> 00:06:00.588
ever...

00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:01.823
again.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.670
Dai: I see.

00:06:09.305 --> 00:06:10.340
Let's go.

00:06:10.374 --> 00:06:11.743
Levizoom!

00:06:15.383 --> 00:06:17.488
Baran [thought]: But
if there ever was to be

00:06:17.522 --> 00:06:20.060
a single exception...

00:06:20.093 --> 00:06:22.698
It would be you, Dai.

00:06:33.854 --> 00:06:37.327
Crocodine: Good luck,
Dragon Knights.

00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:40.400
I have a feeling they're
going to pull this off.

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:41.937
Do you think so?

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:44.643
The two of them...

00:06:44.676 --> 00:06:47.414
I fear that together they
might awaken something.

00:06:47.447 --> 00:06:51.021
An even greater evil
force than we could fathom.

00:06:53.359 --> 00:06:56.165
Merle: I'm sorry.
Just ignore what I said!

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:00.206
Like anyone could possible
ignore something a seer says.

00:07:00.239 --> 00:07:02.244
Don't worry about
a thing, Merle.

00:07:02.278 --> 00:07:04.348
We're gonna do our
very best out there!

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:05.651
Sure will!

00:07:05.684 --> 00:07:08.623
And besides...
Today we've got not one,

00:07:08.657 --> 00:07:11.730
but two powerful Dragon Knights
helping us out, don't we?

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:14.134
So, if we lose,
then it's fate-

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:17.341
Our enemy would have to
be stronger than the gods.

00:07:17.374 --> 00:07:20.314
And in that case,
why worry, right?

00:07:20.347 --> 00:07:21.650
R-Right.

00:07:22.351 --> 00:07:25.057
Okay. Well, Maam, Big Guy?

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.225
It looks like we're up.

00:07:26.258 --> 00:07:29.833
Facing the Royal Guard on
our own isn't gonna be easy,

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:30.935
but let's try.

00:07:30.968 --> 00:07:32.638
We don't have to win.

00:07:32.672 --> 00:07:35.845
We only need to keep
them distracted...

00:07:35.878 --> 00:07:38.817
So that those two
can get the gate open.

00:07:38.851 --> 00:07:42.592
Popp: Princess? The camp
will be in your hands.

00:07:42.625 --> 00:07:44.462
Take care of
Hyunckel and Chiu...

00:07:44.495 --> 00:07:46.299
And everyone else, okay?

00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:48.637
I'll save you
the clichÃ©d goodbyes.

00:07:48.671 --> 00:07:51.409
But, thank you - give
it everything you got.

00:07:51.442 --> 00:07:53.012
We always do.

00:07:58.857 --> 00:08:00.027
There they go.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.295
Then let's hurry, Dai.

00:08:01.329 --> 00:08:05.771
If you slow me down, I will not
hesitate to leave you behind.

00:08:14.789 --> 00:08:16.626
Leona: It's finally happening.

00:08:16.659 --> 00:08:18.597
I'm sorry, Nova.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:21.468
I know you wanted to
go with them, didn't you?

00:08:21.503 --> 00:08:23.541
Yes, I did want
to go with them.

00:08:23.574 --> 00:08:26.847
But I already know that
I'm not as strong as they are.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.586
I will stay here and
help with the backup.

00:08:29.619 --> 00:08:30.921
Thank so much.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.830
I'm worried...
if it all goes wrong...

00:08:34.863 --> 00:08:38.169
and King Vearn can't be beaten
by two Dragon Knights...

00:08:38.202 --> 00:08:40.741
Then it's all been in vain.

00:08:40.774 --> 00:08:43.748
Still, we can't
just give in, can we?

00:08:43.781 --> 00:08:46.820
We need to stay vigilant
and hold the line!

00:08:46.853 --> 00:08:48.456
Right.

00:08:48.489 --> 00:08:51.262
Merle [thought]:
How can I be so selfish?

00:08:51.295 --> 00:08:52.932
The princess is the one under

00:08:52.965 --> 00:08:55.804
the most pressure
in this battle.

00:08:56.272 --> 00:08:57.876
God of Dragons...

00:08:57.909 --> 00:09:02.785
please bless Dai,
Popp, and the others.

00:09:07.995 --> 00:09:10.668
Here goes. It's time
for the main event, huh?

00:09:10.701 --> 00:09:13.339
You know, I really hope
I never have to come back

00:09:13.372 --> 00:09:16.312
to this awful
place ever again.

00:09:16.345 --> 00:09:18.383
Crocodine: I doubt you will.

00:09:18.416 --> 00:09:20.755
Once the Dark
Citadel Gate is open,

00:09:20.788 --> 00:09:22.725
we'll face King Vearn.

00:09:22.759 --> 00:09:26.265
We won't be coming back
unless we defeat him.

00:09:26.298 --> 00:09:28.937
For now, let's just focus
on keeping the attention

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:32.645
of the Hadlar
Royal Guard, okay?

00:09:32.678 --> 00:09:35.751
If only we had some
real backup on our side.

00:09:41.429 --> 00:09:42.765
W-What?

00:09:48.009 --> 00:09:49.044
Popp: There!

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.082
[shrieking]

00:09:51.115 --> 00:09:53.987
Wha... Wha... Wha...?!

00:09:57.962 --> 00:09:58.530
Gomechan?!

00:09:58.563 --> 00:10:00.032
You followed us!

00:10:03.306 --> 00:10:04.576
You really shouldn't have.

00:10:04.609 --> 00:10:05.878
It's gonna be dangerous.

00:10:05.912 --> 00:10:07.214
Popp: The little
guy just can't

00:10:07.247 --> 00:10:10.187
be left behind when
we're so close to the end.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.455
Am I right?

00:10:11.489 --> 00:10:15.229
It's incredible we've made so
many reliable friends, isn't it?

00:10:16.031 --> 00:10:17.133
We sure have.

00:10:18.369 --> 00:10:21.442
So, you've been with us from
the very beginning, Gomechan.

00:10:21.475 --> 00:10:23.412
What do you say we move out?

00:10:24.816 --> 00:10:27.722
I'm impressed that
you noticed, Popp.

00:10:27.755 --> 00:10:28.958
Well, you know,

00:10:28.991 --> 00:10:31.763
Maam looked a little
lumpier than usual, so...

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:36.807
What was that for?!

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.411
We can't waste all of our
strength fooling around!

00:10:39.445 --> 00:10:41.516
You're the one
fooling around here-

00:10:41.549 --> 00:10:43.219
You... weirdo!

00:10:43.252 --> 00:10:44.421
[chuckling]

00:10:44.455 --> 00:10:48.831
If you two were ever to marry,
I know who'd be in charge.

00:10:48.864 --> 00:10:51.202
Why... would
I marry such a...

00:10:51.235 --> 00:10:52.470
Such a what?!

00:10:52.505 --> 00:10:55.176
[laughing]

00:10:55.209 --> 00:10:56.179
You're lucky.

00:10:56.212 --> 00:10:57.414
You two always quarrel,

00:10:57.447 --> 00:11:01.890
but the bond between you is
impossible to break, isn't it?

00:11:01.923 --> 00:11:04.695
Nothing greater
than having a family.

00:11:04.729 --> 00:11:09.171
I realized that when I
saw Dai and Baran together.

00:11:09.205 --> 00:11:12.845
If I manage to actually
survive this battle...

00:11:12.878 --> 00:11:15.449
I should find
a wife of my own.

00:11:15.483 --> 00:11:18.055
[cackling]

00:11:18.088 --> 00:11:19.424
Aw, Crocodine...

00:11:19.458 --> 00:11:21.462
Big Guy...

00:11:21.495 --> 00:11:23.432
Then it's settled.

00:11:23.465 --> 00:11:25.771
We'll make it
home in one piece.

00:11:27.107 --> 00:11:29.144
Yes. Agreed.

00:11:30.714 --> 00:11:33.185
Popp [thought]: Dai,
you can count on us.

00:11:33.218 --> 00:11:35.423
I hope all goes
well on your end.

00:11:39.264 --> 00:11:40.499
They're here.

00:12:08.857 --> 00:12:09.992
Dai [thought]:
The secret entrance

00:12:10.026 --> 00:12:12.197
is all the way down here?

00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:14.535
I guess it's meant
to be hard to find.

00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:17.909
It won't be easy for Popp and
the others to fight alone.

00:12:17.942 --> 00:12:19.812
We need to hurry.

00:12:20.514 --> 00:12:21.849
Baran: Relax.

00:12:22.985 --> 00:12:24.989
Dai: Your voice...
Is this...?

00:12:25.022 --> 00:12:28.630
Baran: It is. I'm using
telepathy to talk to you.

00:12:28.663 --> 00:12:30.968
I had a theory that
it might be possible...

00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:33.038
through the resonance
of our crests.

00:12:33.072 --> 00:12:35.409
And apparently, it's true.

00:12:37.313 --> 00:12:38.617
Dai: Telepathy...

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:43.092
Baran: Dai, it's all for nothing
unless we breach that gate.

00:12:43.126 --> 00:12:45.531
Focus on completing
the objective.

00:12:45.564 --> 00:12:47.066
Do you understand?

00:12:50.339 --> 00:12:51.441
Baran: This way.

00:12:56.385 --> 00:12:58.857
Popp: The queen looks
like she's brand new...

00:12:58.891 --> 00:13:02.197
I was sure Hyunckel damaged
her during the ambush.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:05.070
They must be able to
regenerate their bodies

00:13:05.103 --> 00:13:07.675
using Hadlar's Magic Power.

00:13:07.708 --> 00:13:09.178
Hym: Only three of you?

00:13:09.211 --> 00:13:12.685
Do you really plan on
fighting us all by yourselves?

00:13:12.718 --> 00:13:14.789
Talk about hubris.

00:13:14.822 --> 00:13:16.125
Popp: Shut up.

00:13:16.158 --> 00:13:20.166
Watch out or you're gonna
regret underestimating us!

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.305
Hey, where's that dumb bishop
guy with all the knives?!

00:13:23.339 --> 00:13:27.246
Popp: I owe him a little payback
for what he did to our friend.

00:13:28.783 --> 00:13:30.520
Albinass: Fenbren is missing?!

00:13:35.062 --> 00:13:37.802
Th-that ring bears our emblem!

00:13:37.835 --> 00:13:39.304
Could it be...?!

00:13:44.347 --> 00:13:45.617
Dai: There it is!

00:13:51.295 --> 00:13:52.497
Dai: What's that?

00:13:57.675 --> 00:14:00.280
Vearn: The bishop moves.

00:14:00.313 --> 00:14:03.820
And not under
Lord Hadlar's orders.

00:14:03.853 --> 00:14:06.860
An unexpected
turn of events...

00:14:06.894 --> 00:14:10.099
How very intriguing.

00:14:10.934 --> 00:14:12.203
Dai: That's...

00:14:14.008 --> 00:14:15.944
Fenbren [thought]:
Sorry, everybody...

00:14:15.977 --> 00:14:19.050
but these targets
belong to me.

00:14:24.729 --> 00:14:25.664
Hyunckel!

00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:28.169
You shouldn't be getting up!

00:14:28.202 --> 00:14:29.471
Hyunckel...

00:14:29.506 --> 00:14:30.774
You're not going...

00:14:30.808 --> 00:14:33.379
I must. They need my help.

00:14:33.413 --> 00:14:34.849
Stop being foolish.

00:14:34.882 --> 00:14:36.085
You're in such bad shape

00:14:36.118 --> 00:14:39.024
that Merle's normal
healing spells won't work.

00:14:39.058 --> 00:14:40.459
I'll put it bluntly.

00:14:40.493 --> 00:14:43.534
You won't be any help
to Dai or to the others.

00:14:43.567 --> 00:14:45.937
In fact, you're more
likely to be a hinderance

00:14:45.971 --> 00:14:48.075
considering the
state you're in.

00:14:48.108 --> 00:14:51.950
Even if I can't actually fight,
then I'll serve as a shield.

00:14:51.983 --> 00:14:55.356
I can at least get in
the way of enemy attacks.

00:14:55.389 --> 00:14:56.993
No, that's crazy!

00:14:57.026 --> 00:15:00.065
Lady Amy; where
did you put my weapon?

00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:04.508
Hyunckel: Quickly.
Where's my Dark Armor Spear?

00:15:07.446 --> 00:15:09.719
The spear, I...

00:15:09.752 --> 00:15:11.288
Threw it away.

00:15:11.321 --> 00:15:12.759
[shocked gasps]

00:15:12.792 --> 00:15:14.461
Look, with or without it

00:15:14.495 --> 00:15:17.901
you can't stand on the
battlefield anymore, get it?

00:15:17.935 --> 00:15:20.072
There's no point
having that weapon!

00:15:20.105 --> 00:15:26.184
And so... I got
rid of the thing.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.926
Amy... Y-you...

00:15:29.959 --> 00:15:32.831
You are not going to
fight without your weapon.

00:15:32.865 --> 00:15:35.403
Just face the facts.

00:15:35.436 --> 00:15:37.107
Please, listen to me.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.212
Stay here... Hyunckel.

00:15:45.122 --> 00:15:47.027
W-Wait, Hyunckel.

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.596
Where are you going?!

00:15:54.207 --> 00:15:58.182
Leona: Amy... Do you have
feelings for Hyunckel?

00:15:59.251 --> 00:16:02.090
If so, that didn't help.

00:16:02.124 --> 00:16:05.362
He would go into battle
even without a weapon.

00:16:05.396 --> 00:16:09.906
All your actions did was give
him one more disadvantage.

00:16:09.939 --> 00:16:11.375
Haven't you learned yet?

00:16:11.408 --> 00:16:14.447
He is a warrior that
fights without reason.

00:16:19.424 --> 00:16:20.492
Amy...

00:16:25.203 --> 00:16:27.173
Amy: Wait! Don't go!

00:16:27.942 --> 00:16:28.877
Just move.

00:16:28.911 --> 00:16:29.813
Amy: Why?

00:16:29.846 --> 00:16:32.652
Why won't you just give up?!

00:16:32.685 --> 00:16:34.387
No need to worry.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:35.958
I'm immortal.

00:16:35.991 --> 00:16:38.362
No, you're a
human just like me!

00:16:38.396 --> 00:16:41.268
What are you talking
about "immortal?"

00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:43.172
Maybe if you were
healed, somehow...

00:16:43.205 --> 00:16:45.811
But not in this state!

00:16:45.844 --> 00:16:48.382
You won't make it!

00:16:48.416 --> 00:16:51.890
And if it will help Dai and
the others win this fight...

00:16:51.923 --> 00:16:53.560
Then so be it.

00:16:53.594 --> 00:16:54.562
Now move.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.435
No...

00:16:59.071 --> 00:17:01.776
Amy: Don't. Please...

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:03.178
Hyunckel!

00:17:12.264 --> 00:17:13.566
Hyunckel: Leave me.

00:17:16.471 --> 00:17:18.510
I love you.

00:17:18.544 --> 00:17:22.317
Amy: I've... I've always
been in love with you.

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:24.288
I can't bear to watch anymore.

00:17:24.321 --> 00:17:26.860
To see you keep
fighting hopeless battles,

00:17:26.893 --> 00:17:29.031
to see you wounded...

00:17:29.064 --> 00:17:32.003
So, please... Don't go.

00:17:32.036 --> 00:17:35.442
Please stop going so
gladly to your own doom.

00:17:43.191 --> 00:17:45.029
You're wrong.

00:17:45.062 --> 00:17:48.435
I am not glad at
all... I'm afraid.

00:17:49.037 --> 00:17:50.775
Huh?

00:17:50.808 --> 00:17:52.979
The man I used to be.

00:17:53.012 --> 00:17:56.485
I was a Dark Swordsman,
fighting for evil.

00:17:56.519 --> 00:18:00.259
And the guilt I carry over
turning my sword against

00:18:00.292 --> 00:18:05.537
my master and fellow students
continues to eat at my soul.

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:08.275
It won't stop
tearing me apart.

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:10.681
It terrifies me.

00:18:10.714 --> 00:18:12.149
Oh, Hyunckel...

00:18:13.218 --> 00:18:15.456
Hyunckel: That's why I fight.

00:18:15.489 --> 00:18:18.162
Only the pain and
suffering I endure

00:18:18.195 --> 00:18:21.035
in deadly combat
can alleviate my guilt

00:18:21.068 --> 00:18:24.174
for all that I've
done wrong in this life.

00:18:24.208 --> 00:18:27.013
It makes me feel...

00:18:27.046 --> 00:18:29.819
like I'm making a
difference in the world,

00:18:29.852 --> 00:18:31.522
bringing justice!

00:18:41.709 --> 00:18:44.247
Amy: No... How?!

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.721
I hid it back in the
forest near the castle.

00:18:48.623 --> 00:18:52.898
You see? My friend
is calling me...

00:18:52.931 --> 00:18:54.568
...to the battle.

00:18:55.269 --> 00:18:57.541
W-Wait! Wait! I...

00:19:12.537 --> 00:19:13.840
Hyunckel: Amy...

00:19:15.744 --> 00:19:17.147
This is me.

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:20.754
You're the only
one who knows my truth.

00:19:20.788 --> 00:19:22.792
Thank you.

00:19:22.825 --> 00:19:27.901
But now... You're better
off forgetting it.

00:19:37.253 --> 00:19:39.825
Dai: The bishop, Fenbren!

00:19:41.194 --> 00:19:43.265
Baran: I remember this one.

00:19:44.367 --> 00:19:47.339
Fenbren: I sense two
sources of Orichalcum.

00:19:47.373 --> 00:19:51.849
The larger one must be
Baran's Demon Dragon Blade.

00:19:51.883 --> 00:19:56.959
Baran... the infamous Dragon
Master that scarred my face.

00:19:56.993 --> 00:20:01.168
While the others had their
wounds healed by Lord Hadlar,

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:04.842
I chose to leave my
damaged eyes as they were.

00:20:04.876 --> 00:20:10.019
It cost me my vision, but this
wound is for me to remember...

00:20:10.052 --> 00:20:13.391
to remind me of
that humiliation.

00:20:13.425 --> 00:20:18.536
To stoke the flames
of my vengeance.

00:20:21.876 --> 00:20:24.280
Baran: It seems not
all of Hadlar's minions

00:20:24.314 --> 00:20:26.251
are on the surface.

00:20:26.284 --> 00:20:28.222
Leave this to me.

00:20:28.255 --> 00:20:30.425
I'm the one he wants.

00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:37.240
Bishop, if you wish to waste
the life I spared, so be it.

00:20:37.273 --> 00:20:40.379
Your arrogance will
cost you everything.

00:20:44.387 --> 00:20:48.295
Dai: It's strange.
He looks so calm.

00:20:52.403 --> 00:20:55.409
Dai: Magic Power?! Look out!

00:20:55.443 --> 00:20:57.012
Fenbren: Take this!

00:20:57.046 --> 00:21:00.419
Kaswoosh!

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:07.200
Dai: Using a Kaswoosh
spell underwater?

00:21:07.233 --> 00:21:09.806
That spell can easily
backfire down here!

00:21:09.839 --> 00:21:10.940
Baran: Dai!

00:21:16.184 --> 00:21:17.186
Fenbren [thought]:
The Orichalcum

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.190
left Baran's life signal.

00:21:19.224 --> 00:21:23.131
I've got you now, old man!

00:21:23.165 --> 00:21:25.937
To defeat a powerful
enemy like you,

00:21:25.971 --> 00:21:31.381
I know that I have to use
my greatest attack right away!

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:35.557
Twin Sword Pinning!

00:21:36.693 --> 00:21:40.232
Now I just target
your life-signal...

00:21:40.266 --> 00:21:43.673
and hit you with
this finishing blow!

00:21:46.512 --> 00:21:47.881
Dai [thought]:
Where did he...?!

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:52.056
Baran: The flow
of the water... There!

00:21:57.233 --> 00:21:58.636
Fenbren: Got you!

00:21:59.505 --> 00:22:03.411
Fenbren: Baran... falls!

00:23:37.601 --> 00:23:40.039
Narrator: Popp, Maam, and
Crocodine face off against

00:23:40.072 --> 00:23:43.913
the Hadlar Royal Guard
in another vicious battle.

00:23:43.947 --> 00:23:47.955
Meanwhile, Dai and Baran gain
the advantage against Fenbren,

00:23:47.988 --> 00:23:50.527
but on the other side
of the Dark Citadel Gate,

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.499
a challenger awaits
whose only purpose is to

00:23:53.533 --> 00:23:55.636
stop the Dragon Knights.

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:57.440
So don't miss
the next episode of

00:23:57.473 --> 00:24:00.279
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:00.312 --> 00:24:02.517
"Hadlar's Challenge".
