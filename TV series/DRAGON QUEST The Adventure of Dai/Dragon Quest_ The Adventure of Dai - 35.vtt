WEBVTT

00:01:50.588 --> 00:01:53.493
[cheering]

00:01:53.527 --> 00:01:55.097
What on earth is that thing?!

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.533
Go get him!

00:01:58.504 --> 00:02:01.342
Maam: So that's why you
need the Sword of Champions.

00:02:01.375 --> 00:02:04.582
Yeah. You think
you can win this?

00:02:06.385 --> 00:02:10.695
I do, but there's no way
I'm going to accept that sword.

00:02:10.728 --> 00:02:11.697
Both: Huh?!

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:15.672
I'm not going to help
you kill your own father.

00:02:15.705 --> 00:02:16.740
No way.

00:02:18.578 --> 00:02:19.746
M-Maam...

00:02:20.715 --> 00:02:21.550
Popp: But...

00:02:23.153 --> 00:02:25.791
MC: The fighters have
taken their positions...

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.663
And now...

00:02:27.696 --> 00:02:28.631
Let's begin!

00:02:28.664 --> 00:02:32.872
[excited cheering]

00:02:32.906 --> 00:02:34.976
Baran may be the enemy...

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.149
but he's still your
long-lost father.

00:02:38.182 --> 00:02:40.420
I don't want you
to have the sword,

00:02:40.453 --> 00:02:43.192
if you're just going to
use it to kill him.

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:45.998
Please, Maam.

00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:48.136
The power of
the Dragon Knight...

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:50.006
It's a terrifying
force that could destroy

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.477
the entire world
as we know it.

00:02:52.512 --> 00:02:56.653
Baran wants to use that
power to wipe out humanity.

00:02:56.686 --> 00:02:57.555
But Dai here...

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:59.793
He can use that same
ability for good-

00:02:59.826 --> 00:03:02.030
to defeat the Dark Army!

00:03:02.064 --> 00:03:03.568
That's the reason...

00:03:03.601 --> 00:03:07.575
He needs the sword of champions,
so he can face Baran!

00:03:11.015 --> 00:03:14.956
Listen, I don't want to fight
with Baran at all, really.

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.827
I want to show him something.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.766
That there's a different
way for the Dragon Knight.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.303
Being raised by Grampa...

00:03:21.336 --> 00:03:23.039
Learning from Master Avan...

00:03:23.073 --> 00:03:25.845
And having all my friends
at my side through everything

00:03:25.878 --> 00:03:27.549
has made me into what I am.

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:28.550
But, Dai...

00:03:28.584 --> 00:03:31.022
Dai: Either way, I need
the Sword of Champions

00:03:31.055 --> 00:03:33.594
to match his Demon
Dragon Blade...

00:03:33.627 --> 00:03:36.465
And if it ever looks like I'm
going down the wrong path...

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:39.572
Then I want you to go ahead
and punch my lights out.

00:03:41.276 --> 00:03:44.281
[laughing]

00:03:44.315 --> 00:03:46.385
Alright, then. I'll do it.

00:03:48.422 --> 00:03:51.597
So much has changed since
we went our different ways.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.003
But I promise I'll do everything
I can to win the tournament!

00:03:55.036 --> 00:03:56.005
Both: Aw, yeah!

00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:58.043
Popp: Right!

00:03:58.076 --> 00:03:58.978
Dai: Thanks!

00:03:59.011 --> 00:04:03.220
[happy chirps]

00:04:03.253 --> 00:04:06.425
Okay. Let's go see
how Chiu is doing!

00:04:13.874 --> 00:04:14.909
[pained groan]

00:04:19.152 --> 00:04:20.855
[chuckle]

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.390
Pretty good, Chiu...

00:04:22.424 --> 00:04:24.563
The Grand Master
and Miss Maam...

00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:27.802
You might be just as good
a fighter as they are.

00:04:27.836 --> 00:04:30.474
Maam [thought]: But Grand
Master and I are the only ones

00:04:30.508 --> 00:04:32.410
you've ever sparred with...

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:33.714
[chuckling]

00:04:33.747 --> 00:04:36.653
Stop acting so tough,
you puny little rat.

00:04:36.686 --> 00:04:39.458
Ha! Laugh while you
still can, sleazeball.

00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:42.632
Just wait 'til I bust out
my most powerful move!

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:44.235
Here it comes.

00:04:44.268 --> 00:04:46.272
Chiu's about to use
his signature attack.

00:04:46.305 --> 00:04:48.042
He's got a signature attack?!

00:04:52.351 --> 00:04:53.386
Here goes...

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.023
[battle cry]

00:04:55.057 --> 00:04:56.359
Try my...

00:04:56.393 --> 00:04:58.564
Rattus Fastus Fist!

00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:02.538
[battle cry]

00:05:03.206 --> 00:05:04.441
Both: Whoa!

00:05:08.049 --> 00:05:10.955
[pained groan]

00:05:11.455 --> 00:05:14.796
[pained groan]

00:05:14.829 --> 00:05:15.998
A knockout!

00:05:16.032 --> 00:05:19.104
And the winner of this
round is Wrestler Gomez!

00:05:19.138 --> 00:05:20.875
[cheering]

00:05:20.908 --> 00:05:21.810
Amazing!

00:05:21.843 --> 00:05:22.846
Alright, Gomez!

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:24.516
[victorious roar]

00:05:24.549 --> 00:05:27.956
Looks to me like his confidence
got the better of him.

00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:29.692
He's not exactly strong.

00:05:29.726 --> 00:05:32.063
He always tries
his best, though...

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:35.872
Oh, no. I know what's wrong.

00:05:35.905 --> 00:05:39.679
Chiu: [defeated groan]

00:05:39.713 --> 00:05:43.352
H-how did he manage to
counter my greatest attack?

00:05:43.386 --> 00:05:45.391
Chiu, this is
hard for me to say,

00:05:45.424 --> 00:05:47.629
but I think you might
have one weakness.

00:05:47.662 --> 00:05:48.564
Huh?!

00:05:48.597 --> 00:05:50.601
But I didn't think
I had any weaknesses?!

00:05:50.634 --> 00:05:53.105
Power, speed, technique...
I'm the full package!

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:56.580
You're still a rat, though,
so your limbs are too short.

00:05:56.613 --> 00:06:01.021
Maam: Your limbs are
too short... Too short...

00:06:01.055 --> 00:06:03.360
You're still a little rat...
Still a little rat...

00:06:03.393 --> 00:06:05.598
Your limbs are too short...

00:06:05.632 --> 00:06:06.767
He can't reach far enough.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.604
I mean, that's gotta
be a critical weakness

00:06:08.637 --> 00:06:10.006
for a Martial Artist.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.913
And he won't be able to
hit his enemies without it.

00:06:12.946 --> 00:06:13.981
No, no!

00:06:14.014 --> 00:06:14.983
[crying]

00:06:15.017 --> 00:06:17.087
What is up with this bozo?

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.456
[excited cheering]

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.195
And the victor...
is Fighter Baloria!

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:23.534
[cheering]

00:06:23.567 --> 00:06:25.671
C'mon. Try to cheer up.

00:06:25.705 --> 00:06:28.409
Oh, be quiet.
You wouldn't get it.

00:06:28.443 --> 00:06:29.846
Even with all my training

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.450
I'll never make it
in the martial arts.

00:06:32.484 --> 00:06:34.154
So, why would I cheer up?

00:06:34.188 --> 00:06:35.457
Don't worry so much.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.562
Didn't Maam say you
could still hold your own

00:06:37.595 --> 00:06:39.566
with headbutts and
ramming attacks?

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:40.902
You've got the strength.

00:06:40.935 --> 00:06:43.139
Do you really think a rat
who fights with headbutts

00:06:43.173 --> 00:06:45.043
and ram attacks
could be "cool?"

00:06:45.076 --> 00:06:46.680
Well, uh, I guess not.

00:06:46.713 --> 00:06:47.515
H-Hey.

00:06:47.548 --> 00:06:49.620
I have to be cool,
you hear me?!

00:06:49.653 --> 00:06:51.488
The only reason I
entered this tournament

00:06:51.523 --> 00:06:54.195
was to show Miss
Maam how cool I am!

00:06:54.228 --> 00:06:55.463
Uh, w-what?!

00:06:55.496 --> 00:06:58.236
Even for a monster,
that's awfully presumptuous.

00:06:58.269 --> 00:07:00.240
Hah! Well that's true love.

00:07:00.273 --> 00:07:01.543
Aw, get real.

00:07:01.577 --> 00:07:02.945
Will you pipe down?

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:06.052
I knew from the second I saw
you I wasn't gonna like you.

00:07:06.085 --> 00:07:06.987
What?!

00:07:07.989 --> 00:07:08.857
I get it.

00:07:08.891 --> 00:07:11.296
You're Miss Maam's
ex-boyfriend, right?

00:07:11.329 --> 00:07:11.963
Wha...

00:07:13.132 --> 00:07:15.972
It's not like it's any of
my business, though, is it?

00:07:16.005 --> 00:07:19.278
I'm not sure what
happened between you, but...

00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:20.614
Chiu: Here's two gold coins.

00:07:20.647 --> 00:07:23.688
Just forget about
her, alright?

00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:25.691
Y'know, for a little
rodent that taught himself

00:07:25.724 --> 00:07:27.796
how to speak
you're awfully dumb.

00:07:27.829 --> 00:07:28.731
Why, you...

00:07:28.764 --> 00:07:30.434
You dare strike a
trained Martial Artist?!

00:07:30.467 --> 00:07:32.037
You're going to regret that!

00:07:32.071 --> 00:07:36.980
[roaring]

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.259
Well, I guess I'll let you
off the hook for that one.

00:07:43.293 --> 00:07:44.595
[frustrated grunts]

00:07:45.664 --> 00:07:48.069
Well, I guess we made
a weird new friend today.

00:07:49.204 --> 00:07:51.509
Yes! It's Miss Maam's turn.

00:07:55.751 --> 00:07:59.191
Chiu: Miss Maam!
Do your best for me!

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.263
MC: Let the fight begin.

00:08:06.973 --> 00:08:09.512
-All right! Good one!
-Yes! Hurray!

00:08:09.546 --> 00:08:10.948
Wow, look at her go.

00:08:15.157 --> 00:08:16.258
[frightened whimper]

00:08:17.427 --> 00:08:18.931
[pained grunt]

00:08:18.964 --> 00:08:21.135
[screaming]

00:08:22.606 --> 00:08:24.609
Fighter: [screaming]

00:08:25.377 --> 00:08:28.316
[cheering]

00:08:28.349 --> 00:08:30.053
MC: The Romos Martial
Arts Tournament

00:08:30.087 --> 00:08:34.294
is now down to its
eight best fighters!

00:08:34.327 --> 00:08:36.399
Now, folks; allow
me to introduce

00:08:36.432 --> 00:08:39.506
the unassailable
champions of our kingdom!

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:42.010
First up is our
top contender to win.

00:08:42.043 --> 00:08:44.783
A warrior of
unmatched strength;

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:46.018
Larba!

00:08:46.051 --> 00:08:46.954
Woman: Larba!

00:08:46.987 --> 00:08:48.022
Man: Win it!

00:08:48.055 --> 00:08:51.328
MC: Next, the master of
the omni-whip... Stangul!

00:08:51.362 --> 00:08:53.065
Woman: Sir Stangul!

00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:56.806
MC: The mighty spell-wielding
Mage... Fobster!

00:08:57.207 --> 00:08:58.744
Man: Amazing!

00:08:58.778 --> 00:09:03.420
MC: And the hunter who
never misses... Hilto!

00:09:03.453 --> 00:09:04.689
What a formidable and

00:09:04.722 --> 00:09:06.760
intimidating
group we have today.

00:09:06.793 --> 00:09:10.366
Next, with equal measure
of power and technique...

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.072
It's Wrestler Gomez!

00:09:13.874 --> 00:09:14.942
Yeah!

00:09:14.976 --> 00:09:19.886
MC: The knight with the
gale-force slash... Baloria!

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.790
MC: Is he strong
or is he weak?

00:09:21.823 --> 00:09:25.062
The mysterious
mercenary, Mr. Ghost!

00:09:26.031 --> 00:09:29.137
MC: And finally, the
martial arts master...

00:09:29.171 --> 00:09:31.676
Her name... is Maam!

00:09:32.978 --> 00:09:33.714
She's so cute.

00:09:33.747 --> 00:09:35.216
Good luck to you.

00:09:36.686 --> 00:09:39.224
How did she get so popular?

00:09:39.257 --> 00:09:42.832
MC: These eight will move
on to compete in the finals!

00:09:43.567 --> 00:09:46.005
MC: But, just who will win...

00:09:46.038 --> 00:09:50.647
and claim the legendary
Sword of Champions?!

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.658
It sure does look impressive.

00:09:55.691 --> 00:09:56.660
Incredible.

00:09:56.693 --> 00:09:58.964
What a trophy that
blade will make.

00:09:58.997 --> 00:10:01.001
I doubt you could
even wield it.

00:10:01.034 --> 00:10:03.106
Besides, I will be the victor.

00:10:03.139 --> 00:10:03.874
You can sure try.

00:10:03.908 --> 00:10:05.376
But if I have it my way...

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:07.948
That sword is going to
fetch me quite the fortune.

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:10.420
Maam [thought]: I won't
let any of you have it.

00:10:10.453 --> 00:10:11.857
That sword is for Dai.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:14.127
It's going to
be used for good.

00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:17.000
[cheering]

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:19.772
Maam's skills certainly
have developed, haven't they?

00:10:19.806 --> 00:10:22.711
How exciting this
tournament has been.

00:10:24.314 --> 00:10:25.618
Where has Zamza gone?

00:10:25.651 --> 00:10:27.086
Over there, sire.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.794
And now my friends,
the tournament's host,

00:10:30.827 --> 00:10:34.267
Mister Zamza, will explain
the rules of the finals.

00:10:42.618 --> 00:10:45.356
Huh. So, this is the
guy that came up with

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.394
the Martial Arts
Tournament idea?

00:10:47.428 --> 00:10:49.398
I wonder who he is.

00:10:49.431 --> 00:10:50.400
What fun...

00:10:50.434 --> 00:10:52.237
You've all fought so well.

00:10:52.271 --> 00:10:53.841
You eight champions

00:10:53.874 --> 00:10:57.147
are exactly what I was
hoping to see here today.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.786
I suggested this
tournament to the King

00:10:59.819 --> 00:11:03.226
and it has proven to
be quite the spectacle.

00:11:03.259 --> 00:11:06.566
What a collection
of promising samples...

00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:08.570
Now, the eight
of you will become

00:11:08.603 --> 00:11:13.445
integral to the creation
of a new Dark Army!

00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:17.855
This some kind of bad joke?

00:11:17.889 --> 00:11:20.092
And now, playtime is over.

00:11:21.963 --> 00:11:23.132
W-What?!

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.902
[shocked gasps]

00:11:29.377 --> 00:11:31.282
[shocked gasps]

00:11:31.315 --> 00:11:35.356
[evil laughter]

00:11:36.793 --> 00:11:39.699
Mister Zamza, what's
the meaning of this?

00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:42.237
Thank you for your
help, King Romos.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.912
Your contribution to the
Dark Army was invaluable.

00:11:45.945 --> 00:11:47.314
King Romos: Who are you?

00:11:47.347 --> 00:11:50.988
[devious chuckle]

00:11:53.527 --> 00:11:54.963
Zamza: You might
know my father,

00:11:54.996 --> 00:11:57.301
the Commander Zaboera...

00:11:57.334 --> 00:12:00.439
I am Zamza; Mystic Scholar!

00:12:14.034 --> 00:12:17.942
You might know my father,
the Commander Zaboera...

00:12:17.975 --> 00:12:21.114
I am Zamza; Mystic Scholar!

00:12:23.085 --> 00:12:24.321
A Darkling?

00:12:24.354 --> 00:12:27.895
[evil chuckle]

00:12:29.533 --> 00:12:31.235
What's a "Mystic Scholar?"

00:12:31.268 --> 00:12:33.506
Zaboera's son? No way.

00:12:34.341 --> 00:12:35.778
Zamza: [chuckling]

00:12:35.811 --> 00:12:38.148
Fobster: We've been
captured by the Dark Army?

00:12:38.182 --> 00:12:39.150
But why?!

00:12:39.184 --> 00:12:40.988
The Mystic Legion has
been experimenting with

00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:44.194
the creation of what
we call Superior Beings.

00:12:44.227 --> 00:12:48.603
We require human specimens who
are at their physical peak.

00:12:48.637 --> 00:12:49.839
[delighted chuckle]

00:12:49.872 --> 00:12:51.543
This martial arts
tournament has proven to be

00:12:51.576 --> 00:12:53.078
vital in my research.

00:12:53.112 --> 00:12:55.049
It's also an
opportunity to remove any

00:12:55.082 --> 00:12:57.287
potential threats
to the Dark Army.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.894
What's the phrase?
"Two birds, one stone?"

00:13:00.927 --> 00:13:04.168
Curse you! I will make
you pay for deceiving me!

00:13:04.201 --> 00:13:08.275
It's too late.
These eight belong to me.

00:13:08.308 --> 00:13:10.312
And if I deal with
you right now?

00:13:10.346 --> 00:13:14.522
That saves me having to
come back again, King Romos.

00:13:14.555 --> 00:13:16.391
Perish!

00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:20.868
[frightened yells]

00:13:20.901 --> 00:13:23.439
Zamza: [laughing]

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.049
It's Dai... and Popp!

00:13:28.082 --> 00:13:31.255
We won't let the Dark Army
get away with this!

00:13:31.288 --> 00:13:32.559
This is Dai?!

00:13:32.592 --> 00:13:33.994
Popp, protect the king.

00:13:34.027 --> 00:13:35.564
All right. Go get him, Dai!

00:13:36.465 --> 00:13:38.202
I'll be your opponent.

00:13:38.236 --> 00:13:40.339
Zamza [thought]:
Dai, the Hero...

00:13:40.373 --> 00:13:41.542
What luck.

00:13:41.576 --> 00:13:45.751
It appears that my two birds
may have just become three.

00:13:45.784 --> 00:13:48.657
Ladies and gentlemen,
run for your lives!

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.395
[fleeing cries]

00:13:51.429 --> 00:13:53.633
Huh?! Are you kidding me?

00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:56.204
I refuse to be
captured so easily!

00:14:02.584 --> 00:14:03.553
It can't be cut?

00:14:03.587 --> 00:14:05.992
Magic isn't working!

00:14:06.025 --> 00:14:07.895
So, what is this thing?

00:14:13.105 --> 00:14:15.611
This cage... is alive.

00:14:15.644 --> 00:14:16.646
Maam: What?

00:14:16.679 --> 00:14:18.416
It's a creature?

00:14:18.449 --> 00:14:20.019
Miss Maam, no!

00:14:21.021 --> 00:14:23.092
Come on! Open up!

00:14:23.827 --> 00:14:24.829
[pained yell]

00:14:24.863 --> 00:14:26.264
What are you doing?

00:14:30.908 --> 00:14:34.481
Zamza: Get your filthy
hands off my Bio-prison.

00:14:34.515 --> 00:14:36.620
You weak little gutter rat!

00:14:36.653 --> 00:14:38.289
Gutter rat?!

00:14:38.322 --> 00:14:40.126
I'm a Karate-

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.700
You dare defy the
great Zamza? Begone!

00:14:43.733 --> 00:14:44.569
[terrified yells]

00:14:44.602 --> 00:14:45.937
That's enough!

00:14:46.471 --> 00:14:47.641
Little whelp.

00:14:55.624 --> 00:14:56.526
Zamza [thought]:
Could this...

00:14:56.559 --> 00:14:59.732
Could this power be
what I think it is?

00:14:59.766 --> 00:15:01.903
Chiu, Gomechan,
go help Popp.

00:15:01.937 --> 00:15:04.407
What? But why
do I have to...

00:15:05.309 --> 00:15:07.782
Okay. Fine.
I get it! I get it!

00:15:07.815 --> 00:15:12.089
Let them all go. I will
not be asking again.

00:15:13.527 --> 00:15:18.670
[chuckling]

00:15:18.704 --> 00:15:22.477
[cackling]

00:15:22.512 --> 00:15:24.481
Oh, my. Magnificent!

00:15:24.516 --> 00:15:26.284
What a sight to behold...

00:15:26.318 --> 00:15:29.859
The power of an actual
Dragon Knight in action!

00:15:29.893 --> 00:15:31.530
[delighted laughter]

00:15:31.563 --> 00:15:32.965
Dai: What's so funny?

00:15:32.998 --> 00:15:35.469
It's not funny-
it's truly joyous.

00:15:35.504 --> 00:15:38.977
Your appearance very nearly
deceived me, at first.

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:41.114
But now I feel
blessed to witness such

00:15:41.148 --> 00:15:44.689
legendary strength and
power in battle. You see...

00:15:44.722 --> 00:15:46.626
The end goal
for our research...

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:50.199
Is to harness a power that
matches that of a Dragon Knight.

00:15:50.232 --> 00:15:52.103
And how do you
plan to do that?!

00:15:52.136 --> 00:15:54.040
[menacing chuckle]

00:15:56.144 --> 00:15:59.284
The Mystic Legion is
unmatched in Magic Power...

00:15:59.318 --> 00:16:01.523
but we lack strength
and vitality.

00:16:01.556 --> 00:16:04.028
So I've been leading
the research on a theory

00:16:04.061 --> 00:16:06.632
that my father
proposed as a solution...

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.604
Dai: [pained cry]

00:16:08.637 --> 00:16:11.074
The Superior Being Studies!

00:16:13.078 --> 00:16:15.851
What's a... Superior being?!

00:16:15.885 --> 00:16:17.020
Raw power.

00:16:17.053 --> 00:16:19.424
Power that transcends
even the Darklings.

00:16:20.226 --> 00:16:21.829
Zamza: By
surgically combining

00:16:21.863 --> 00:16:23.866
the strengths
of various monsters,

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:29.410
we've devised a way to create
such beings artificially.

00:16:30.747 --> 00:16:32.216
Zamza: And when
your father Baran

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:34.689
took his Dragonoid form...

00:16:34.722 --> 00:16:36.826
We were convinced.

00:16:36.859 --> 00:16:38.262
His strength...

00:16:38.295 --> 00:16:42.471
That is the ultimate goal of
our Superior Being Studies...

00:16:42.505 --> 00:16:45.878
Zamza: To create the
ultimate bio-weapon-

00:16:45.911 --> 00:16:48.884
one that defies
the will of the gods!

00:16:48.917 --> 00:16:52.390
Did you say... a bio-weapon?

00:16:52.424 --> 00:16:54.160
[roaring]

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:56.498
[impressed chuckle]

00:16:56.533 --> 00:16:59.438
The project requires several
test subjects, you see.

00:16:59.471 --> 00:17:02.545
That is all that these
humans are to me...

00:17:02.578 --> 00:17:05.584
We can't sacrifice
our Darkling servants

00:17:05.617 --> 00:17:08.022
for every experiment.

00:17:08.055 --> 00:17:10.259
Zamza: A human
makes for the perfect

00:17:10.292 --> 00:17:14.167
test sample in our
ongoing research.

00:17:14.201 --> 00:17:16.405
I won't let you take them.

00:17:16.438 --> 00:17:17.675
[amused chuckle]

00:17:17.708 --> 00:17:20.614
Then you'll have to
get angry and fight me.

00:17:20.647 --> 00:17:21.783
Let's see it.

00:17:21.816 --> 00:17:25.489
Show me the full extent
of the power you possess!

00:17:25.524 --> 00:17:28.597
You can't resist a
fight, can you, Dai?

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:32.437
Like a moth to the flame-
the perfect sample!

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.809
One with which I
will create a monster

00:17:34.843 --> 00:17:37.280
exactly like your father!

00:17:38.816 --> 00:17:42.423
Shut your mouth!

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:52.209
Wow! No wonder
he's called the Hero.

00:18:00.794 --> 00:18:02.029
[chuckling]

00:18:02.063 --> 00:18:03.866
[roaring]

00:18:15.657 --> 00:18:16.693
The power in that boy!

00:18:16.726 --> 00:18:19.131
I can't believe how strong
little Dai has grown.

00:18:19.164 --> 00:18:22.036
He's truly a Hero.
Victory's assured!

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:23.372
Popp [thought]:
Don't lose your head

00:18:23.405 --> 00:18:25.309
and waste all
your energy, Dai.

00:18:26.445 --> 00:18:28.416
He must be hiding something!

00:18:28.449 --> 00:18:29.652
Zamza [thought]: I can win.

00:18:29.685 --> 00:18:33.927
If this is his best,
then my Superior Being...

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.329
Dai: [roaring]

00:18:48.422 --> 00:18:50.160
Now's your chance.
Finish him!

00:18:50.193 --> 00:18:52.330
I agree. End this now!

00:18:52.363 --> 00:18:54.200
Something's wrong.

00:18:54.234 --> 00:18:56.138
When Dai uses his
all of his strength,

00:18:56.171 --> 00:18:57.608
he could destroy a mountain.

00:18:57.641 --> 00:19:00.479
It's enough power to
split the earth open!

00:19:00.514 --> 00:19:03.953
Sure, Darklings may be
more powerful than humans...

00:19:03.987 --> 00:19:07.426
But Zamza has taken more hits
than he should be able to.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.164
He should be done by now-

00:19:09.197 --> 00:19:12.170
but he doesn't even
seem close to losing.

00:19:12.203 --> 00:19:14.340
I think Dai's noticed, too.

00:19:19.217 --> 00:19:20.521
What's wrong?

00:19:20.554 --> 00:19:22.991
Your first real fight
freaking you out, little guy?

00:19:23.024 --> 00:19:24.394
Don't be stupid.

00:19:24.427 --> 00:19:26.265
I'm not freaking out.

00:19:26.298 --> 00:19:28.703
I can't explain it but
just seeing that guy

00:19:28.736 --> 00:19:32.711
is shaking me to my core and
putting my whole body on edge!

00:19:34.247 --> 00:19:35.617
I guess you must
be wondering...

00:19:35.651 --> 00:19:37.855
why you can't
summon the strength

00:19:37.888 --> 00:19:40.627
to defeat a mere Darkling...

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:44.234
Would you...
care to guess, boy?

00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:46.873
Dai [thought]: I'll
finish him in one shot...

00:19:46.906 --> 00:19:48.341
with that attack!

00:19:48.844 --> 00:19:52.951
[roaring]

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.759
C'mon, Crest Beam!

00:19:58.563 --> 00:19:59.531
There we go!

00:19:59.565 --> 00:20:01.869
The most powerful move
a Dragon Knight can do!

00:20:11.054 --> 00:20:14.160
Zamza: [victorious chuckle]

00:20:14.194 --> 00:20:15.496
Well, well, well...

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:18.368
It appears a Dragon Knight
can be outmatched...

00:20:18.402 --> 00:20:20.273
by a Superior Being.

00:20:20.306 --> 00:20:23.011
Hang on, is he
saying he's already...

00:20:23.044 --> 00:20:24.447
Zamza: Correct!

00:20:24.481 --> 00:20:28.322
The Superior Beings are
ninety percent complete.

00:20:28.355 --> 00:20:31.629
I used my own
body as the base.

00:20:31.662 --> 00:20:36.238
You've shown me the power
of a Dragon Knight...

00:20:36.271 --> 00:20:38.944
And now it's your
turn to behold.

00:20:38.977 --> 00:20:40.680
Observe, if you will,

00:20:40.713 --> 00:20:45.422
the strength of over a
hundred monsters combined!

00:20:47.828 --> 00:20:53.539
Zamza: The power of the
ultimate Superior Being!

00:21:05.798 --> 00:21:09.872
[snarling]

00:21:09.906 --> 00:21:12.309
[roaring]

00:21:13.947 --> 00:21:15.215
He did it...

00:21:15.249 --> 00:21:17.954
I can't believe it's real.

00:21:17.988 --> 00:21:20.627
[roaring]

00:21:21.529 --> 00:21:25.002
Something strange
is going on out there.

00:21:25.036 --> 00:21:26.304
No, Dai...

00:21:29.578 --> 00:21:31.916
Popp [thought]: No
wonder Chiu's terrified.

00:21:31.949 --> 00:21:36.792
That thing really is
the sum of all monsters!

00:21:38.563 --> 00:21:42.303
And, now...
Little Hero Dai.

00:21:42.337 --> 00:21:45.443
You have been selected
for the honor of serving

00:21:45.476 --> 00:21:50.452
as the Super Being
Zamza's first opponent.

00:21:51.488 --> 00:21:53.593
Zamza: You're welcome.

00:21:54.629 --> 00:22:00.907
[laughing]

00:23:37.768 --> 00:23:40.205
Narrator: Dai unleashes
the full power of his crest

00:23:40.239 --> 00:23:42.911
against the Superior
Being Zamza...

00:23:42.944 --> 00:23:45.282
But his stamina
is soon depleted.

00:23:45.316 --> 00:23:46.686
Popp comes to his rescue,

00:23:46.719 --> 00:23:49.324
but finds that he's
helpless against a force

00:23:49.357 --> 00:23:51.495
that surpasses
even the Dragon Knight.

00:23:51.529 --> 00:23:53.666
With his new
friends in peril,

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.271
Chiu must rise
to the occasion.

00:23:56.304 --> 00:23:58.208
See how he fares next time on

00:23:58.241 --> 00:24:00.479
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:00.514 --> 00:24:02.951
"The Superior Being
Versus Chiu".
