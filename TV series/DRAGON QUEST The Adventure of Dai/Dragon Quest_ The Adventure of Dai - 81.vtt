WEBVTT

00:01:51.791 --> 00:01:53.528
So, you somehow survived.

00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:54.395
Quite impressive.

00:01:54.428 --> 00:01:56.968
Larhart: That's
not entirely accurate.

00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:59.739
The truth is, I didn't
survive anything.

00:02:00.542 --> 00:02:01.677
You see...

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.083
I was given a drop of Master
Baran's own Dragon Blood.

00:02:05.116 --> 00:02:06.419
That power...

00:02:06.452 --> 00:02:08.356
that power running through
his veins brought me back.

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:09.626
Hyunckel [thought]:
Of course...

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.298
If Baran could use it to
bring Popp back to life,

00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:15.237
then why not
Larhart, as well?

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.142
After the battle, Master
Baran gave all three of us

00:02:18.176 --> 00:02:20.381
Dragon Masters a
drop of his elixir.

00:02:20.414 --> 00:02:23.687
Then, by the Fountain of
Miracles, he laid us to rest.

00:02:26.694 --> 00:02:29.298
However, as
generous as that was,

00:02:29.331 --> 00:02:31.169
Dragon Blood
doesn't guarantee

00:02:31.202 --> 00:02:34.174
the resurrection of
all who consume it.

00:02:34.208 --> 00:02:36.780
Only those who possess
the willpower to resist

00:02:36.813 --> 00:02:38.349
the pull of the afterlife and

00:02:38.383 --> 00:02:40.420
crawl back from
the edge of oblivion

00:02:40.453 --> 00:02:43.861
are able to experience
its full effects...

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:47.201
Out of the three of us...

00:02:47.234 --> 00:02:50.240
I was the only one
able to make it back.

00:02:51.076 --> 00:02:52.444
Hyunckel [thought]: I see.

00:02:52.478 --> 00:02:54.349
Then Popp's will must
have been strong enough

00:02:54.382 --> 00:02:57.020
to bring him back
after casting Megante.

00:02:57.054 --> 00:02:58.924
It didn't happen all
at once, either.

00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.093
As a matter of fact,

00:03:00.126 --> 00:03:02.732
I only woke up in my
coffin a few days ago.

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:05.270
If I hadn't, I'd have
missed the final battle.

00:03:05.304 --> 00:03:07.141
The gods have good timing.

00:03:07.174 --> 00:03:09.244
Indeed. And the same
could be said for you.

00:03:09.278 --> 00:03:11.282
If you hadn't...
rescued me...

00:03:11.315 --> 00:03:15.123
Rescued you? I don't recall
ever doing that, Hyunckel.

00:03:15.156 --> 00:03:18.764
I merely disposed of an enemy
who was standing in my way.

00:03:18.798 --> 00:03:22.772
I have no interest in
saving losers. That was all.

00:03:22.805 --> 00:03:24.274
What did you say?

00:03:25.176 --> 00:03:28.049
I know exactly
how soft you are.

00:03:28.082 --> 00:03:29.619
Let me guess,
your injuries are from

00:03:29.653 --> 00:03:31.957
protecting your
enemy, aren't they?

00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:33.360
A truly competent Warrior

00:03:33.393 --> 00:03:35.965
would never act on such
a foolish sentiment.

00:03:35.998 --> 00:03:37.935
It's no wonder that you lost.

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:40.240
Enough! Show some respect.

00:03:40.274 --> 00:03:41.810
What if he's right?

00:03:44.181 --> 00:03:45.284
Hyunckel...

00:03:45.317 --> 00:03:46.754
Hyunckel: To coldly
analyze a situation

00:03:46.787 --> 00:03:49.158
and defeat one's
enemy like a machine,

00:03:49.192 --> 00:03:51.530
never showing a
hint of mercy...

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:53.332
If that's what makes
a true Warrior,

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:56.172
then it's something I'm
no longer willing to do.

00:03:56.205 --> 00:03:58.443
If that means I'm
not worthy anymore...

00:03:58.476 --> 00:04:01.482
Then so be it.
I stand by my actions.

00:04:01.517 --> 00:04:03.988
Hym was in danger, and
I couldn't abandon him.

00:04:04.021 --> 00:04:05.357
Simple as that.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.428
Larhart: I can't
say I'm surprised.

00:04:07.461 --> 00:04:09.298
It appears I made
a mistake leaving

00:04:09.331 --> 00:04:13.206
the fates of Master Baran
and Dino in your hands.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.943
And just looking at
the state of you,

00:04:14.977 --> 00:04:19.051
I doubt you'll be of any use to
Master Dino for what lies ahead.

00:04:21.656 --> 00:04:23.828
Larhart - what do you
think you're doing?!

00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:25.230
Put it down!

00:04:25.263 --> 00:04:28.002
This man is too pitiful
to live any longer.

00:04:28.035 --> 00:04:31.308
I'm going to put him down,
just like he deserves!

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:52.586
But, L-Larhart...

00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:55.524
The infamous Warrior
Hyunckel is no more.

00:04:55.558 --> 00:04:57.127
At this very moment,

00:04:57.161 --> 00:04:59.732
I've struck him down
for the last time.

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:02.872
And considering that,
I don't see any reason

00:05:02.906 --> 00:05:06.378
why I shouldn't take the
Dark Armor Spear for myself.

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:15.798
Yes. Go ahead. Wear it well.

00:05:15.831 --> 00:05:18.570
A dead man has
no use for armor.

00:05:19.973 --> 00:05:21.576
Larhart: Amdo!

00:05:30.595 --> 00:05:32.699
Farewell, my old friend.

00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:34.802
I will fight in your place.

00:05:35.436 --> 00:05:37.341
Thanks a lot.

00:05:37.374 --> 00:05:38.677
Don't mention it.

00:05:38.711 --> 00:05:42.017
You were too kind to go
on fighting forever, anyway.

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:44.322
Hym: "Too kind"?!

00:05:44.355 --> 00:05:47.060
This "warrior" is
getting on my nerves.

00:05:47.093 --> 00:05:48.831
No, let him go.

00:05:48.864 --> 00:05:51.704
That's just what his
way of showing decency.

00:05:51.737 --> 00:05:53.707
I have a feeling
that he must have been

00:05:53.741 --> 00:05:55.811
sent to protect
Dai in my place.

00:05:55.844 --> 00:06:00.254
A savior summoned by Baran
from the heavens above.

00:06:00.287 --> 00:06:03.192
Hym: What makes you
think he's a savior?

00:06:03.225 --> 00:06:06.466
When a Warrior witnesses one
of his own fall in battle,

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:08.069
he carries their will.

00:06:08.102 --> 00:06:10.507
My duty has now become his.

00:06:11.977 --> 00:06:16.185
Hyunckel [thought]: What a
strange twist of fate this is...

00:06:16.218 --> 00:06:19.091
Now we've both watched
each other die.

00:06:19.124 --> 00:06:21.630
I've done everything I could.

00:06:21.663 --> 00:06:24.435
I even managed to rescue Hym.

00:06:24.468 --> 00:06:25.838
Maybe now...

00:06:25.871 --> 00:06:29.579
Maybe now no one will scold
me for accepting defeat...

00:06:30.146 --> 00:06:33.386
Mas... Master...

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:35.456
Hym: Yeah, I'm familiar
with the custom.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.662
What really gets under
my skin is his whole,

00:06:37.695 --> 00:06:41.035
"We've got a special
Warrior bond" attitude.

00:06:41.068 --> 00:06:42.037
I guess someday,

00:06:42.071 --> 00:06:44.208
I'm just going to have
to take him down, too.

00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:45.344
Come to think of it...

00:06:45.377 --> 00:06:46.813
Once we've healed up,

00:06:46.847 --> 00:06:50.020
I suppose I need to settle the
score with you first, don't I?

00:06:50.053 --> 00:06:52.925
Hyunckel, are you
even listening to me?

00:06:54.428 --> 00:06:55.698
Larhart [thought]:
Thank you, Hyunckel.

00:06:55.731 --> 00:06:57.902
For carrying on my will,
and for how much

00:06:57.936 --> 00:07:00.675
you've given to keep Master
Dino safe along the way.

00:07:00.708 --> 00:07:03.513
You can leave the rest to me.
I won't let you down.

00:07:03.547 --> 00:07:06.319
Because I am the battle
machine you spoke of...

00:07:06.352 --> 00:07:07.721
And if I'm right,

00:07:07.755 --> 00:07:10.794
your friends are going to
need that force on their side.

00:07:14.034 --> 00:07:15.505
Look, up ahead!

00:07:15.538 --> 00:07:17.041
Crocodine: Is that Hyunckel?

00:07:17.074 --> 00:07:17.976
Wait...

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:20.180
I know you. You're
from the Royal Guard.

00:07:20.213 --> 00:07:21.449
Why are you here?

00:07:21.482 --> 00:07:22.785
Hyunckel...

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:24.823
What happened?
Did you do this?

00:07:24.856 --> 00:07:27.862
Hym: Keep it down. He's gone.

00:07:27.896 --> 00:07:28.864
It's over.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.368
He...

00:07:31.402 --> 00:07:34.843
After all that fighting,
he finally gets to rest.

00:07:34.877 --> 00:07:37.782
Probably... for the
first time ever...

00:07:37.816 --> 00:07:40.988
he can put... the
battlefield behind him...

00:07:41.021 --> 00:07:44.862
and allow that weary soul of
his to find peace at last.

00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:49.706
Rest... Hyunckel.

00:08:01.863 --> 00:08:03.734
Mystvearn: It appears
the King's Orichalcum Army

00:08:03.767 --> 00:08:06.105
has been wiped off the board.

00:08:07.608 --> 00:08:09.478
Mystvearn: But that's
hardly a shock.

00:08:09.513 --> 00:08:12.017
Maximum believed he had
King Vearn's favor...

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:15.791
But in truth, he was really
just a delusional maniac.

00:08:15.825 --> 00:08:18.864
That pompous fool must've
thought he was hunting a mouse

00:08:18.897 --> 00:08:22.203
and learned that even
a wounded beast can bite.

00:08:22.237 --> 00:08:25.945
Now, who could dispose
of Orichalcum soldiers?

00:08:25.978 --> 00:08:28.449
Clearly one of the
Disciples not present.

00:08:28.483 --> 00:08:30.420
Hyunckel, or perhaps
Avan himself?

00:08:30.454 --> 00:08:32.157
Avan: Actually,
I'm right here.

00:08:42.979 --> 00:08:44.347
All: Master Avan!

00:08:44.381 --> 00:08:45.684
And I've been a
little occupied,

00:08:45.718 --> 00:08:47.722
so it must have been
my first student.

00:08:47.755 --> 00:08:49.626
He could do it bare-handed.

00:08:49.659 --> 00:08:51.429
It's about time, Master!

00:08:51.462 --> 00:08:52.832
We were getting worried.

00:08:53.233 --> 00:08:53.967
[laughing]

00:08:55.369 --> 00:08:57.374
[amused chuckle]

00:08:57.407 --> 00:08:58.910
Uh, excuse me...

00:08:58.944 --> 00:09:01.916
Not just Master Avan.
I'm here, too, y'know.

00:09:03.821 --> 00:09:04.421
Sorry.

00:09:04.454 --> 00:09:05.423
I mean, c'mon.

00:09:05.456 --> 00:09:06.627
It's not like we
could've forgotten

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.198
you were with him
or anything. Honestly.

00:09:09.231 --> 00:09:10.333
[chuckling]

00:09:11.202 --> 00:09:12.404
Seriously?

00:09:12.437 --> 00:09:14.174
[annoyed snarl]

00:09:14.207 --> 00:09:15.744
Mystvearn: The legendary Avan.

00:09:15.778 --> 00:09:17.681
I see you and the
Princess went ahead

00:09:17.715 --> 00:09:20.453
to explore the
Tower of Supremacy.

00:09:20.486 --> 00:09:21.756
Leona: You've got that right.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.663
And we've already mapped
out most of the path ahead.

00:09:24.696 --> 00:09:25.864
Easy peasy.

00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:27.367
Also, while we were at it,

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.773
I took the liberty of
disarming the Reaper's traps.

00:09:29.806 --> 00:09:31.676
It was a rather tough job...

00:09:31.709 --> 00:09:34.715
But tough jobs are why
I carry this special item.

00:09:35.383 --> 00:09:36.687
Wait! M-Master...

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.325
I don't think you need to
show them that right now.

00:09:39.358 --> 00:09:41.195
Ah-ha!

00:09:45.303 --> 00:09:48.409
Seeperil Glasses I found
in the Cave of Trials...

00:09:48.442 --> 00:09:50.346
They let me see
through any trap!

00:09:50.379 --> 00:09:51.315
And this hammer?

00:09:51.348 --> 00:09:52.785
Well, I'd be
happy to give you

00:09:52.818 --> 00:09:55.223
a demonstration of
what it can do!

00:10:07.515 --> 00:10:08.884
Swish, swish, swish!

00:10:08.918 --> 00:10:11.022
With this hammer of mine
and Seeperil Glasses,

00:10:11.055 --> 00:10:14.763
crushing traps has never
been a bigger smash!

00:10:14.796 --> 00:10:17.500
Leona [thought]: Ugh, so much
for making a cool entrance.

00:10:17.535 --> 00:10:19.840
He just had to open
his dorky mouth.

00:10:19.873 --> 00:10:21.442
Sorta overdid it, huh?

00:10:21.475 --> 00:10:23.145
Yep. Even at a time like this,

00:10:23.179 --> 00:10:25.317
he can't let a lame
bit go to waste.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:28.489
He's probably got
something big up his sleeve.

00:10:28.524 --> 00:10:30.828
Seems like we shouldn't have
bothered worrying about him.

00:10:30.862 --> 00:10:32.799
He's only getting started.

00:10:32.832 --> 00:10:38.910
Mystvearn: [laughing]

00:10:38.944 --> 00:10:39.478
Huh?

00:10:39.512 --> 00:10:40.748
Well, I mean...

00:10:40.781 --> 00:10:43.219
He's right. It was
pretty ridiculous.

00:10:43.253 --> 00:10:44.889
Are you kidding me?

00:10:46.927 --> 00:10:48.430
Mystvearn [thought]:
How eccentric.

00:10:48.463 --> 00:10:50.367
What a fascinating man.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.539
I understand now, Avan.

00:10:52.572 --> 00:10:54.776
Quite the human, aren't you?

00:10:54.809 --> 00:10:56.613
Your reputation precedes you.

00:10:56.647 --> 00:10:59.018
Since first defeating
the Dark Lord Hadlar,

00:10:59.051 --> 00:11:00.520
you've been one of
our chief threats.

00:11:00.554 --> 00:11:03.594
But to actually see you at work
is something altogether...

00:11:03.627 --> 00:11:04.730
intriguing.

00:11:04.763 --> 00:11:06.799
You try to hide your
overwhelming talents

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:08.938
behind the mask
of a buffoon...

00:11:08.971 --> 00:11:11.174
But that obnoxious
integrity in your heart

00:11:11.208 --> 00:11:13.980
shines too brightly
to be concealed.

00:11:14.014 --> 00:11:16.418
It's not surprising your
disciples continue to

00:11:16.452 --> 00:11:19.057
look up to you
as much as they do.

00:11:20.894 --> 00:11:22.999
Avan: Princess Leona has
filled me in on everything

00:11:23.032 --> 00:11:26.272
that's happened over the course
of these past three months.

00:11:26.305 --> 00:11:30.113
And from what she's told me,
the current Dark Commander...

00:11:30.146 --> 00:11:32.685
Mystvearn, will be the
greatest and most powerful

00:11:32.718 --> 00:11:35.558
adversary left in our
fight against Vearn.

00:11:35.591 --> 00:11:38.463
It appears... Her
assessment was correct.

00:11:38.496 --> 00:11:39.632
Mystvearn: As are you.

00:11:39.665 --> 00:11:41.703
There's been no
word from Zaboera,

00:11:41.737 --> 00:11:43.840
I can only assume
he's been defeated.

00:11:43.874 --> 00:11:47.681
Our self-proclaimed "terrifying
guardian" has also fallen.

00:11:47.715 --> 00:11:49.785
I am the only one
who remains that can

00:11:49.819 --> 00:11:53.025
exterminate the pests
scurrying around our palace.

00:11:53.058 --> 00:11:56.733
Mystvearn: I, Mystvearn, will
have to vanquish you myself.

00:11:56.766 --> 00:11:59.171
Popp: Good luck with that,
you talking bedsheet.

00:11:59.204 --> 00:12:01.175
We beat the other five
Legion Commanders,

00:12:01.208 --> 00:12:03.747
and you are about
to be number six.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.751
Mystvearn: The Six
Legion Commanders?

00:12:05.784 --> 00:12:06.819
[chuckling]

00:12:06.853 --> 00:12:08.389
I'm getting real
sick of that laugh.

00:12:08.422 --> 00:12:11.162
Mystvearn: The Six Legion
Commanders were a joke...

00:12:11.195 --> 00:12:13.600
Nothing more than an
amusing little experiment

00:12:13.634 --> 00:12:15.872
that King Vearn
concocted on a whim.

00:12:15.905 --> 00:12:17.908
The only one he's
ever actually needed to

00:12:17.942 --> 00:12:21.583
wipe out the surface
world... is me.

00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:25.724
Be that as it may, our king
has a far grander vision than

00:12:25.758 --> 00:12:27.427
the mere destruction
of your realm.

00:12:27.461 --> 00:12:31.637
His desire is to claim the sun
and its blessings for himself.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.106
By creating the six legions,

00:12:33.139 --> 00:12:35.043
he not only gained
the ultimate army,

00:12:35.076 --> 00:12:37.447
but a legacy that
would span generations.

00:12:37.481 --> 00:12:40.988
Hadlar was the most powerful
being on the surface world,

00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:43.059
so Vearn invited
him to join forces

00:12:43.092 --> 00:12:45.764
and placed me
under his command.

00:12:45.798 --> 00:12:48.302
We chose Baran and
Hyunckel for their spirit,

00:12:48.336 --> 00:12:50.975
and for their burning
hatred of the human world...

00:12:51.008 --> 00:12:54.147
Crocodine for his loyalty
and brute strength...

00:12:54.181 --> 00:12:56.920
Flazzard and Zaboera
for their cunning

00:12:56.953 --> 00:12:58.924
and their ruthless ambition...

00:12:58.957 --> 00:13:00.160
Each were selected for

00:13:00.193 --> 00:13:02.832
the potential
King Vearn saw in them.

00:13:02.866 --> 00:13:04.902
In order to compose
the ultimate army,

00:13:04.936 --> 00:13:07.708
the tension between such a
varying group of personalities

00:13:07.742 --> 00:13:09.980
was an essential catalyst.

00:13:10.013 --> 00:13:12.016
Now, it looks like
you've taken that plan

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:13.920
and dragged it
through the mud.

00:13:13.953 --> 00:13:16.893
I'll admit it was an
unfortunate turn of events,

00:13:16.927 --> 00:13:20.065
even if in the end... it
doesn't make any difference.

00:13:20.099 --> 00:13:21.903
The Dark Army
was a fleeting dream

00:13:21.937 --> 00:13:23.874
that only lasted
a few decades.

00:13:23.907 --> 00:13:25.644
There will be more to come.

00:13:25.677 --> 00:13:27.648
Losing it does
not alter our goal

00:13:27.681 --> 00:13:29.786
of wiping out
the surface world.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.055
Armies come and go,

00:13:31.088 --> 00:13:34.628
but I've been around
for thousands of years...

00:13:34.662 --> 00:13:39.037
And for most of them, I alone
have protected King Vearn!

00:13:45.216 --> 00:13:46.719
Popp [thought]:
He's so powerful...

00:13:46.753 --> 00:13:49.625
There's no doubt he's the most
dangerous one of them all.

00:13:49.659 --> 00:13:53.166
It's like he's on an entirely
different level than the others.

00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:54.869
How are we going to do this?

00:13:54.902 --> 00:13:57.575
Mystvearn: Now, come
and face me, little ones.

00:13:57.609 --> 00:13:59.144
The day grows long,

00:13:59.177 --> 00:14:03.352
and it's time for me to make
this White Garden your grave.

00:14:03.386 --> 00:14:04.756
Watch yourself, Dai.

00:14:04.789 --> 00:14:07.060
Don't forget; if he
has a hidden face...

00:14:07.094 --> 00:14:08.897
who knows what else
he's been hiding?

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:11.703
Right. Just one thing to do...

00:14:11.736 --> 00:14:13.472
We fight with
all our strength.

00:14:16.078 --> 00:14:17.614
Avan: Not so fast.

00:14:18.783 --> 00:14:21.656
Now. I will be
the one to fight him.

00:14:28.603 --> 00:14:31.008
Mystvearn: There's always
room for one more, Avan.

00:14:31.041 --> 00:14:33.947
Or do you mean you
wish to face me alone?

00:14:37.153 --> 00:14:39.424
But, Master that's
totally nuts...

00:14:39.458 --> 00:14:41.128
We're all here, aren't we?

00:14:41.162 --> 00:14:43.398
I say we fight
him together...

00:14:46.506 --> 00:14:47.608
Leona [thought]: Master...

00:14:47.641 --> 00:14:49.144
What do you say, Mystvearn?

00:14:49.177 --> 00:14:51.983
Do you accept my
challenge, or refuse?

00:14:54.789 --> 00:14:56.492
Mystvearn: I refuse.

00:14:56.526 --> 00:14:57.293
What?!

00:14:57.326 --> 00:14:58.663
Mystvearn: You're
very compelling.

00:14:58.697 --> 00:15:01.769
But I almost forgot you
were someone else's prey...

00:15:01.802 --> 00:15:04.074
And he tends to be
very vindictive.

00:15:04.107 --> 00:15:05.410
I'm not keen to find out

00:15:05.443 --> 00:15:08.983
how he'll react
if I steal his quarry.

00:15:10.487 --> 00:15:11.421
Wait, no!

00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:15.697
Is that...

00:15:15.731 --> 00:15:19.506
Dai: It's Killvearn.
He's lured Master into a trap!

00:15:19.539 --> 00:15:22.343
Mystvearn: I knew you'd
turn up, Killvearn. Well done.

00:15:22.376 --> 00:15:26.017
The Reaper lives up to
his reputation once again.

00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:27.688
Mystvearn [thought]:
That scythe...

00:15:27.721 --> 00:15:29.324
Killvearn: Apologies, Myst.

00:15:29.357 --> 00:15:32.397
If it's any consolation,
the others are all yours.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.504
I'll have more than enough
fun playing with this one.

00:15:37.373 --> 00:15:38.543
All: Master!

00:15:40.747 --> 00:15:42.450
Master, no!

00:16:07.502 --> 00:16:08.603
Oh, no...

00:16:09.204 --> 00:16:10.774
Where did they go?!

00:16:10.807 --> 00:16:12.712
I have no idea.
It's like they just...

00:16:12.745 --> 00:16:14.748
vanished into thin air.

00:16:16.819 --> 00:16:20.326
Mystvearn: Well, it seems as
though history repeats itself.

00:16:21.127 --> 00:16:22.230
Tell me, Dai.

00:16:22.264 --> 00:16:24.668
How does it feel to
watch your master

00:16:24.702 --> 00:16:26.806
be taken from
you once again?

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.143
To lose him not just
once, but twice...

00:16:29.177 --> 00:16:33.318
I imagine your heart is overcome
with frustration and loss.

00:16:33.352 --> 00:16:35.524
So this was your
plan the whole time.

00:16:35.557 --> 00:16:37.460
You played the bait
so the Reaper could

00:16:37.493 --> 00:16:40.432
swoop in and
ambush Master Avan!

00:16:40.466 --> 00:16:42.872
Mystvearn: This isn't
an ambush. Believe me...

00:16:42.905 --> 00:16:46.211
It's something
far more interesting.

00:16:46.245 --> 00:16:48.850
Mystvearn: A fight
for revenge. A duel.

00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:50.286
All: A duel?!

00:16:50.319 --> 00:16:52.625
Mystvearn: That scythe that
Killvearn used to capture Avan

00:16:52.658 --> 00:16:54.862
was not equipped with
the Reaper Flute,

00:16:54.895 --> 00:16:56.599
but a different
weapon altogether.

00:16:56.632 --> 00:17:00.373
One that opened a portal and
dragged Avan into another realm.

00:17:00.406 --> 00:17:03.212
Suffice to say, your
master wasn't killed...

00:17:03.245 --> 00:17:05.650
But he is about to be.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.220
Avan: Where am I?
What is this place?

00:17:34.842 --> 00:17:36.478
It's not moving...

00:17:38.081 --> 00:17:41.388
Whatever that is, I don't
think it's targeting me.

00:17:41.421 --> 00:17:43.660
But I don't see
anyone else around...

00:17:43.693 --> 00:17:46.131
It stands to reason
this strange robot thing

00:17:46.164 --> 00:17:48.870
is what dragged me
into this place.

00:17:48.903 --> 00:17:50.507
Killvearn: Bingo!

00:17:51.274 --> 00:17:53.345
Killvearn: We meet again, Avan.

00:17:53.378 --> 00:17:56.151
Welcome to my
field of revenge.

00:17:56.184 --> 00:17:57.688
Under normal circumstances,

00:17:57.722 --> 00:18:01.195
I would've preferred to repay
you for humiliating me sooner...

00:18:01.228 --> 00:18:04.568
but I just couldn't decide
which mask I should wear.

00:18:04.602 --> 00:18:07.306
I really liked the
one that you ruined.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:10.547
Choosing a successor
was quite a pain.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.216
Although...

00:18:13.152 --> 00:18:14.622
Killvearn: I was
able to dig up

00:18:14.656 --> 00:18:18.161
the perfect one for
such an occasion.

00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:21.268
Avan [thought]:
It's a Mask of Anger.

00:18:21.301 --> 00:18:23.305
Killvearn: As you can see,
this mask expresses

00:18:23.339 --> 00:18:26.045
how I'm truly feeling,
deep inside.

00:18:26.078 --> 00:18:28.182
I must admit, I'm impressed.

00:18:28.215 --> 00:18:30.219
No man has ever
insulted my honor

00:18:30.252 --> 00:18:33.225
or infuriated me
quite as much as you.

00:18:33.258 --> 00:18:36.733
Perhaps that student of
yours... the yappy little Mage?

00:18:36.766 --> 00:18:38.670
He certainly came close.

00:18:38.703 --> 00:18:41.709
But it's clear that he was
only imitating his master...

00:18:41.742 --> 00:18:46.620
And now, just as I promised,
I'm going to kill you myself.

00:18:46.653 --> 00:18:48.088
We'll see about that.

00:18:48.122 --> 00:18:50.126
So, you're going
with your anger

00:18:50.159 --> 00:18:52.163
and giving up
the smug facade...

00:18:52.196 --> 00:18:53.934
And what sort
of diabolical trap

00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:56.137
have you prepared
for me this time?

00:19:00.446 --> 00:19:03.119
Killvearn: Consider that
my slap with a glove.

00:19:03.152 --> 00:19:05.056
This time,
there are no traps.

00:19:05.089 --> 00:19:07.293
Fair and square, as they say.

00:19:07.327 --> 00:19:09.832
I challenge you to a duel.

00:19:09.865 --> 00:19:11.101
That so?

00:19:11.135 --> 00:19:14.207
Killvearn: It's what this field
we're standing in was made for.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.513
I see you've
already met my toy.

00:19:16.546 --> 00:19:20.019
It's part of a collection of
Underworld relics I've curated -

00:19:20.052 --> 00:19:22.792
a mechanical creature
known as a Judge.

00:19:22.825 --> 00:19:24.696
Killvearn: Its scythe
has the ability to

00:19:24.729 --> 00:19:26.398
tear holes in reality.

00:19:26.432 --> 00:19:29.438
It uses it to drag its
targets into this dimension.

00:19:29.471 --> 00:19:30.874
You may be asking yourself,

00:19:30.908 --> 00:19:33.913
what use did the Underworld
have for such a thing?

00:19:33.946 --> 00:19:35.817
The answer is
duels like these.

00:19:35.851 --> 00:19:39.658
Any time there was a score to
settle, the Judge was summoned.

00:19:39.691 --> 00:19:41.395
Basically, as
the name implies,

00:19:41.428 --> 00:19:44.100
this instrument
presides over the duel...

00:19:44.133 --> 00:19:46.105
Observing every
move and analyzing

00:19:46.138 --> 00:19:49.043
as the challengers
are locked in combat.

00:19:49.076 --> 00:19:51.115
Here, free of
all distractions,

00:19:51.148 --> 00:19:53.686
isolated on this
empty stage, they fight -

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.692
and fight until eventually
one of them falls.

00:19:56.726 --> 00:19:58.596
And in the end,
the Judge will raise

00:19:58.629 --> 00:20:01.869
its fearsome scythe
and pass its ruling...

00:20:02.538 --> 00:20:05.910
The loser is then beheaded.

00:20:05.944 --> 00:20:07.848
What a terrifying device.

00:20:07.881 --> 00:20:08.784
A fitting invention for

00:20:08.817 --> 00:20:11.488
the unending conflict
of the Underworld.

00:20:11.523 --> 00:20:12.891
Killvearn: Very well put.

00:20:12.925 --> 00:20:15.731
In truth, I only got it because
I rather like the design.

00:20:15.764 --> 00:20:18.536
I never imagined I'd actually
wind up using it myself,

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:19.939
but that's life, isn't it?

00:20:19.972 --> 00:20:23.445
It's always the unexpected
things that prove useful.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.251
So, Avan...

00:20:26.285 --> 00:20:28.355
The choice is yours.
Will you accept my challenge?

00:20:28.388 --> 00:20:30.627
Strange definition
of "acceptance."

00:20:30.661 --> 00:20:32.765
If the only way out
is to defeat you,

00:20:32.798 --> 00:20:35.637
then I don't actually have
any choice at all, do I?

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:37.941
There's nothing fair or
square about this...

00:20:39.444 --> 00:20:43.485
I'd even say... that's the
definition of a trap, you fiend.

00:20:44.521 --> 00:20:46.592
Killvearn: Always
with the attitude.

00:20:46.625 --> 00:20:49.430
I assume that
means you accept.

00:20:52.671 --> 00:20:55.543
Now prepare to
meet your doom.

00:20:55.577 --> 00:20:58.348
Avan [thought]: What?
Killvearn's using a sword?!

00:20:58.381 --> 00:21:00.888
Judge: Avan versus Killvearn...

00:21:00.921 --> 00:21:03.291
Let the battle begin.

00:21:23.131 --> 00:21:25.604
Judge: Killvearn
draws the first blood!

00:21:25.637 --> 00:21:28.809
Sixty-five damage
against Avan.

00:21:33.886 --> 00:21:35.990
Mystvearn: I suggest
we make a wager, Dai.

00:21:36.024 --> 00:21:39.230
Which one of them do you think
will make it back here alive?

00:21:39.264 --> 00:21:43.506
Obviously, I'm putting
my gold on the Reaper.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:38.970
Narrator: Locked inside
of another dimension,

00:23:39.004 --> 00:23:41.809
Avan's duel with the
wrathful Killvearn rages on...

00:23:41.842 --> 00:23:43.445
leaving Dai and
the others shaken

00:23:43.478 --> 00:23:45.316
from losing their
master again.

00:23:45.349 --> 00:23:46.619
And when Mystvearn strikes,

00:23:46.653 --> 00:23:48.723
they discover that even
their combined strength

00:23:48.756 --> 00:23:51.127
is no match for the
spectral commander.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.800
But just when it seems as
if he's broken their spirit,

00:23:53.833 --> 00:23:56.104
a lone feather strikes
the battlefield...

00:23:56.137 --> 00:23:58.308
and a mighty warrior
follows close behind.

00:23:58.342 --> 00:24:00.413
See how it ends on
the next episode of

00:24:00.446 --> 00:24:02.383
Dragon Quest:
The Adventure of Dai,

00:24:02.416 --> 00:24:04.521
"The Successor of Justice".
