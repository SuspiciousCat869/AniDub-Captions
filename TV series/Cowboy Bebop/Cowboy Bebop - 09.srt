00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,625
WHAT'S THIS? ED HAS GOT
THE RIGHT SATELLITE,

160
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:42,541
BUT THERE HASN'T BEEN
ANY CONTACT FROM EARTH AT ALL,

161
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:45,791
ONLY RELAYS FROM OTHER
SATELLITE TRANSMITTERS,

162
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,333
AND NOBODY HAS HACKED INTO IT.

163
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:52,500
HERE. NOBODY HERE.

164
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,166
ALWAYS ALONE.

165
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,875
HUH? A VOICE...
INSIDE ED'S HEAD?

166
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,916
INSIDE THE SYSTEM!

167
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,833
WHO ARE YOU?

168
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:16,875
HUH? WHAT?
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

169
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,083
WHO YOU?

170
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,041
HERE. ALWAYS.

171
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:25,291
EDWARD. ED IS
A NET DIVER FROM EARTH.

172
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,291
EARTH?

173
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,166
YEAH. RIGHT.

174
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,875
HEY, WHAT'S YOUR NAME, ANYWAY?

175
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,916
I AM THE CENTRAL
PROCESSING UNIT

176
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,041
ON THE D135
ARTIFICIAL SATELLITE.

177
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:39,541
TOO STUFFY.
DON'T YOU HAVE A NICKNAME?

178
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,916
THEN ED WILL GIVE YOU
ONE RIGHT NOW.

179
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,958
UM, LET'S SEE.

180
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:48,500
I KNOW! WHAT IF
I CALL YOU MPU?

181
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,333
WHY?

182
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:52,333
IT'S LIKE CPU, ONLY NEATER.

183
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,750
HA.

184
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:57,416
"ED" IS SHORT FOR EDWARD WONG
HAU PEPELU TIVRUSKY IV.

185
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,125
ED MADE IT UP, YOU KNOW.

186
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,750
NICE TO MEET YOU.

187
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:05,083
HERE. A SOUVENIR FROM EARTH.

188
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,291
YOU SUPPOSED
TO EAT THIS THING?

189
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:10,125
WHO KNOWS?
THOSE EARTHLINGS ARE WEIRD.

190
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,000
YEAH. THAT MAY BE,

191
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,041
BUT AT LEAST I GOT SOME
INFORMATION OUT OF THEM.

192
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,541
OUR PRIME TARGET
IS A HACKER

193
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,791
NAMED RADICAL EDWARD,
A VERY HEAVY HITTER.

194
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:22,541
GREAT, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
A PROFILE ON THIS GUY.

195
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,541
YES, I DO... SORT OF.

196
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:26,833
WELL, AT LEAST EIN LIKES THEM.

197
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,583
I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT THESE THINGS ARE.

198
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:30,291
HEY!

199
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,875
RADICAL EDWARD'S PROFILE

200
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:38,583
HE'S A 7-FOOT-TALL EX-BASKETBALL
PRO-HINDU GURU DRAG QUEEN ALIEN.

201
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,875
SO WHY'D YOU MAKE
THOSE BIG DOODLES?

202
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:47,416
LONG, LONG AGO,
LONG BEFORE THE GATE DISASTER,

203
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,583
EARTH WAS A BEAUTIFUL PLANET

204
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,000
WHERE PEOPLE LIVED IN
THE HILLS AND VALLEYS

205
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,416
AND BY THE RIVERS,
LAKES, AND SEAS.

206
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,750
BACK THEN, THERE WERE MANY
ANCIENT CARVINGS LIKE THIS.

207
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,875
I USED TO LOOK DOWN AT THEM
AND WONDER ABOUT THEIR MEANING,

208
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,708
WHICH SEEMED TO CHANGE
EACH TIME I SAW THEM.

209
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,583
SO TO REMEMBER THOSE TIMES,

210
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,000
I TRIED TO CREATE THE CARVINGS
THE WAY THEY USED TO BE.

211
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,875
OH, YOU MEAN THERE USED
TO BE MORE BIG DOODLES.

212
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,958
YOU WERE JUST SAD
BECAUSE YOU MISSED THEM.

213
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:17,833
YES. I RECREATED THEM
WITH A 2% MARGIN OF ERROR.

214
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,666
MPU IS GOOD AT DRAWING.

215
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,000
HEY, CAN ED DRAW SOMETHING, TOO?

216
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,125
[GASPS]

217
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,500
WHAT'S WRONG?

218
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:28,875
THIS IS-- THE POLICE
ARE JAMMING MY SIGNAL.

219
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,750
WHAT? HEY, MPU. HEY!

220
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,958
WELL, WELL.
SCORE ONE FOR THE COPS.

221
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:38,166
WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES
TRACKING RADICAL EDWARD.

222
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,583
HMM?

223
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,708
HEY, GUYS.
FOUND YOUR BOUNTYHEAD.

224
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,083
WHAT THE HUH--?

225
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,416
BEBOP.
[BARKS]

226
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,750
GUESS WHAT. NOBODY HACKED
INTO THAT SATELLITE.

227
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,666
THE DATA PROVES
THERE'S NO BREAKIN.

228
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,083
UH, SINCE WHEN DO WE
HAVE AN INTERACTIVE CHANNEL?

229
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,166
WE DON'T.

230
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,208
THIS IS A HACK JOB
DONE IN REAL TIME.

231
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,375
WHO IS THIS KID?

232
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,041
WE'LL SEND YOU MPU's
DATA SO YOU CAN SEE.

233
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,125
WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT'S MPU?

234
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,458
A FRIEND OF EDWARD'S.

235
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:10,083
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
THAT YOU KNOW EDWARD?

236
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:13,375
MMHMM,
BECAUSE EDWARD IS EDWARD.

237
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,875
HUH?

238
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,125
THERE'S NO TIME FOR GAMES.
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT SATELLITE?

239
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:21,166
UM, WELL, I COULD
JUST TELL YOU, I SUPPOSE,

240
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,708
BUT THEN I'D WANT
A FAVOR IN RETURN.

241
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:24,791
A FAVOR?

242
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,833
UH, YEAH. WE CAN
TALK ABOUT THAT LATER.

243
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,250
NOW CUT TO THE CHASE.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

244
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,458
[BARKS]

245
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,458
SO THE CPU ON
AN ABANDONED SATELLITE

246
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:36,166
JUST DECIDES TO DO SOME
LASER CARVINGS ALL ON ITS OWN.

247
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,875
OH, YEAH?
THAT'S BIZARRE.

248
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:39,833
IT GETS MORE BIZARRE.

249
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,291
THIS IS A WEATHER SATELLITE,

250
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,916
SO NO ONE HAS EVEN
THOUGHT OF CHECKING IT.

251
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,625
THEN THE BOUNTY IS NOT ON A
PERSON. IT'S ON THAT SATELLITE.

252
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,875
SINCE MPU's ACCESS CODES
CAN'T BE USED ANYMORE,

253
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,250
YOU'LL HAVE TO ACTUALLY
GO TO THE SATELLITE.

254
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,500
AND DO WHAT?

255
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,000
DESTROY THE TRANSMITTERS
IT USES TO COMMUNICATE

256
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,833
WITH THE OTHER SATELLITES
IN THE NETWORK.

257
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:03,166
THEN CREATE A DIRECT LINK
AND DOWNLOAD MPU.

258
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,333
EASY, HUH?

259
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,708
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

260
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,416
YOU CAN'T USE YOUR COMPUTERS
FOR FLYING OR SHOOTING.

261
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,000
WHAT'S THAT?
DO IT ALL MANUALLY?

262
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,625
IF YOU DON'T,
ALL THE ATTACK SATELLITES

263
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,166
WILL PICK UP YOUR SIGNAL
AND OPEN FIRE.

264
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:18,041
THERE'S ZILLIONS OF THEM,
AND THEY'VE ALL GOT KILL LASERS.

265
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,708
WOW. IS THIS TOO HARD FOR YOU?

266
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,083
OH, NO. I WOULDN'T
CALL IT HARD.

267
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,333
MORE LIKE IMPOSSIBLE.

268
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:27,125
IT'S LIKE TRYING TO PLAY
BASEBALL WITHOUT A BAT.

269
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,750
HEY, WHERE YOU GOING?

270
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,416
NOW, THIS IS THE KIND
OF STUFF I LIKE.

271
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,166
LET'S DO IT.

272
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,166
WAIT A MINUTE.

273
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,250
HOW DO YOU KNOW
SO MUCH ABOUT US?

274
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,250
EDWARD KNOWS EVERYTHING.

275
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,125
LAST WEEK, YOU WERE ON MARS

276
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,583
CHASING A BOUNTYHEAD
NAMED AJIZ WHO GOT AWAY.

277
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,291
SO MUCH FOR
THE ONE-MILLION REWARD.

278
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,750
BEFORE THAT, ON PYORTLE,

279
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,166
THE POLICE BEAT
YOU TO YOUR BOUNTY.

280
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,625
OH, JEEZ.

281
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,000
YOU REALLY ARE RADICAL EDWARD,
THE ONE THEY TALK ABOUT.

282
00:15:57,083 --> 00:16:00,291
UHHUH. WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD?

283
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,833
CONNECT D7 TO NUMBER 2.

284
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:08,166
THAT WAY YOU CAN FIRE
THE LASERS WITHOUT THE COMPUTER.

285
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,000
I'M TRUSTING YOU ON THIS.

286
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,125
LISTEN.

287
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,041
DON'T USE MISSILES
UNLESS YOU HAVE TO.

288
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,166
THEY'RE EXPENSIVE.

289
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,416
YEAH, RIGHT.

290
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,375
1,200 TO TARGET.

291
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,208
ALL RIGHT. PREPARE
TO SHUT DOWN YOUR COMPUTER.

292
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,375
YOU'LL ONLY HAVE ONE CHANCE.

293
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,416
THAT'S ALL I'M GONNA NEED.

294
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,250
AND YOU CAN GIVE US
THE DATA TO PROVE THIS

295
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,166
THAT THAT SATELLITE WAS
ACTING ALL ON ITS OWN?

296
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,458
IT'S THE BOUNTYHEAD?
THERE'S NO HACKER?

297
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,333
ED CAN PROVE IT, NO PROBLEM,

298
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,708
BUT REMEMBER,
ED WANTS A FAVOR IN RETURN.

299
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,291
IF YOU DO IT, ED WON'T
TAKE ANY OF THE REWARD.

300
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:47,291
OH, WELL, NOW,
AREN'T YOU A NICE KID?

301
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,416
THAT'S THE ONE.

302
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,458
HMM.

303
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,833
SOMEONE.

304
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,958
YOU HIT IT? DID YOU?

305
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,166
NO. IT SAW ME COMING.

306
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,625
AN ATTACK SATELLITE
BLOCKED MY LASER BLAST.

307
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:39,000
THEN WE HAVE TO TAKE OUT ALL
THE SATELLITES IN THE SECTOR.

308
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,291
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.

309
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:43,458
IF WE DON'T,
THEY'LL TAKE US OUT.

310
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:49,208
THESE MISSILES
ARE CURVING OFF TARGET.

311
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:52,333
OH, THE CHEAP ONES
ARE WORTHLESS.

312
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,916
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.

313
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,958
HUH?

314
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,666
JET, APPROACH
TO 20 METERS OF MPU

315
