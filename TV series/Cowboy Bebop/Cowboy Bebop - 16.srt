YOU BETRAYED ME?

330
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:43,833
THAT'S WHY YOU LIED
AND TOOK ME OUT HERE?

331
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,291
YOU WERE THE BEST MAN.

332
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:49,375
I WANTED TO TEAM UP,
LIKE BACK IN THE OLD DAYS.

333
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:04,208
SAYONARA, PARTNER.

334
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,958
UH... UNH!

335
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,958
[GUNSHOT]

336
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,666
FAT!

337
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,083
[GRUNTING IN PAIN]

338
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:32,291
HEY, JET.

339
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,125
HUH?

340
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,541
ONE BULLET?

341
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,666
YOU KNEW I'D TAKE YOU OUT
WITH YOUR GUN LIKE THIS.

342
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:47,458
CAN YOU HAND ME A CIGARETTE?

343
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:03,625
I GUESS I... COULDN'T QUIT
SMOKING AFTER ALL.

344
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,625
LET'S KICK THE BEAT.

345
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:27,875
THIS TIME, THE 3 OF US

346
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:30,458
WILL DO THE PREVIEWS
FOR THE NEXT EPISODE.

347
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:33,208
GEE, UH, DO YOU
THINK WE CAN DO IT?

348
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:34,375
WE ONLY HAVE 30 SECONDS.

349
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,500
IF YOU'RE TOO SLOW,
IT WILL BE ALL OVER.

350
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:38,833
YOU SURE ARE ANTSY,
OLD BUDDY.

351
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:40,000
AAH!

352
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,166
WHAT KIND OF STORY IS IT
NEXT TIME, ANYWAY?

353
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,333
HELL, I DON'T KNOW.

354
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:44,041
WHAT?! WE'RE ALREADY
RUNNING OUT OF TIME!

355
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:46,375
TITLE!
AT LEAST TELL THEM THE TITLE!

356
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:49,875
NEXT EPISODE...
UH, WHAT WAS IT?

357
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:50,833
I FORGOT.

358
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:52,708
CAN WE TRY THIS AGAIN?
