00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,541
I GOT IT!
I GOT IT! I GOT IT!

319
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,125
UHH.

320
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,916
--SPIKE! COME BACK IN.
--WHAT'S THAT?

321
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,500
NEW PLAN.
LOOKS LIKE IF WE APPLY

322
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:54,750
ENOUGH ENERGY TO THE SUN STONE,

323
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,250
WE CAN DRAW OUT THE FORCES
TRAPPED INSIDE IT.

324
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,083
YEAH? GREAT. THEN WHAT?

325
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,875
THEN WE TAKE OUR SHOT.
ALL OR NOTHING.

326
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,875
WHATEVER YOU'RE GONNA DO,
DO IT FAST.

327
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:13,916
I PUT IT IN.

328
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
ALL RIGHT.
[BUZZING]

329
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,583
SPIKE, HIT IT
WITH YOUR PLASMA CANNON.

330
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:26,208
RIGHT, I'M SHOOTING
A ROCK NOW.

331
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,458
[BEEPING]
HUH?

332
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,375
LOOKS LIKE YOU MADE IT
IN TIME, JET.

333
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,125
[GASPS]

334
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,125
PAO. YOU'RE ALIVE.

335
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:31,583
MEIFA, IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

336
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,333
[GASPS]

337
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,333
PAO, YOU'RE IN
AN UNSTABLE FORCE FIELD.

338
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,583
I CAN'T GET ANY CLOSER.

339
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:47,666
YES, I KNOW. THERE'S NO
OXYGEN LEFT HERE ANYWAY.

340
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,750
[GASPS]

341
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,750
I SENT YOU THAT MESSAGE
BECAUSE I HOPED

342
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,083
YOU'D MANAGED TO BRING
MY DAUGHTER OUT HERE.

343
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,833
IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'RE SAYING
YOU USED FENG SHUI

344
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:01,791
TO REACH US AND BRING US
OUT HERE ACCORDING TO YOUR WILL.

345
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,291
THAT'S RIGHT.

346
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,333
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

347
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:16,000
YOU WEREN'T IN CONTROL
OF THIS OPERATION.

348
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:22,375
MEIFA IS HERE NOW BECAUSE
BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO FIND YOU.

349
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:26,083
HUH. YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.

350
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:30,541
PERHAPS I GAVE MYSELF
TOO MUCH CREDIT.

351
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:38,666
MEIFA, IT'S SO WONDERFUL
TO SEE YOU ONE LAST TIME.

352
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:43,125
I HATED YOU.
I HATED YOU FOR ALL THOSE YEARS.

353
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:48,375
IT'S TRUE.
IT HURT SO MUCH.

354
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:54,458
BUT NOW I DON'T.

355
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,291
DADDY.

356
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:20,125
NOW, I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS
A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING

357
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,958
THAT WE BROUGHT HER OUT THERE,

358
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:26,166
BUT THAT WAS HOW
THIS PECULIAR CASE ENDED.

359
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,708
MEIFA WENT BACK HOME TO MARS,

360
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:32,208
OUR NO SMOKING AREA
BECAME A SMOKING ZONE AGAIN,

361
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:37,291
AND LIFE RETURNED TO THE SAME
DAILY ROUTINE, JUST LIKE BEFORE.

362
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,541
ONE THING HAS CHANGED, THOUGH.

363
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:40,791
WHEN I READ THE NEWS,

364
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,833
I NEVER CHECK
THE HOROSCOPES ANYMORE.

365
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:27,333
HE CAME WITH A WHISTLE.

366
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:37,125
AND HE APPEARED OUT OF
THE BLUE ON HORSEBACK.

367
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:39,208
WHO IS HE?

368
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:42,250
FRIEND OR FOE, OR JUST
AN OLDFASHIONED COWPOKE?

369
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:45,041
THE NEXT EPISODE
IS A SHOCKING SCIFI

370
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:47,125
SPAGHETTI-WESTERN EPIC SAGA.

371
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:48,625
"COWBOY FUNK."

372
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:51,875
HEY, ARE WE TAKING THIS
COWBOY THING A LITTLE TOO FAR?
