00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:30,333
SPIKE, FIND SOMETHING THAT
CAN BE USED AS AN AIR BRAKE,

316
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:31,583
SO YOU CAN DECELERATE.

317
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:32,833
DECELERATE?

318
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,708
IF YOU DECELERATE WITHIN
THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE,

319
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:37,791
THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL
WILL ACCELERATE YOU INSTEAD,

320
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,458
WHICH WILL GIVE YOU
ENOUGH SPEED TO ESCAPE.

321
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:42,708
HOWEVER, YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN
THE SHIP AT A CERTAIN ANGLE.

322
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,250
TOO FAR IN EITHER DIRECTION

323
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,750
AND YOU'LL BE THROWN OUT TO
THE OTHER END OF THE UNIVERSE.

324

HMM?

00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,083
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT, BOY.

327
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:58,083
I DIDN'T GIVE YOU THE SWORDFISH
FOR NOTHING, YOU KNOW.

328
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:03,458
YEAH. DON'T YOU GO
AND CRASH EITHER, OLD MAN.

MAXIMUM PROPULSION!

330
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:23,583
THERE'S STILL TIME TO CHANGE
YOUR MIND AND LEAVE, MILES.

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,541
AND I THOUGHT
I WAS AFRAID TO FLY!

336
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:14,750
LOWER THE NOSE 0.6 DEGREES.

337
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:24,750
YOU'RE IN TOO DEEP, SPIKE!
YOU'LL BURN TO A CRISP!

338
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:29,583
HUH?

339
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:33,291
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE.

340
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:51,666
IT'S IN THERE.

341
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,666
IT WENT IN.
THAT WAS PERFECT!

342
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,583
DOOHAN, YOU SAVED MY ASS.

343
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:58,916
NOT YET.
HUH?

344
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,541

NOZZLE WON'T WORK EITHER.

WHAT?!
ARE YOU FOR REAL?

349
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,541
WE CAN'T LAND WITHOUT THEM.
OH, WELL.
