SO GET THAT NITRO IN HERE ASAP.

320
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,666
YOU DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF TIME, FAYE.

321
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,125
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

322
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,583
MY FLOATING ACT.

323
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,500
--AAH!
--AAH!

324
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:29,750
ZEROS, GET OUT OF THE WAY!
WE'VE GOTTA LET HIM IN!

325
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,250
BINGO.

326
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,291
IT'S ALL CLEAR! AAH!

327
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,041
I NEED A NEW GIG.

328
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,958
[PANTING]

329
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,083
[MEOWS]

330
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,166
ZEROS.

331
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:10,125
THANKS FOR THE HELP,
VICTORIA TELPISCOREI.

332
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:11,208
HUH?

333
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,500
AND GIVE YOUR HUSBAND
MY THANKS, TOO.

334
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:16,708
I FIGURED OUT WHO
YOU WERE BECAUSE OF THIS.

335
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,541
OF COURSE,
EVERYONE'S HEARD ABOUT HIM

336
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:25,416
THE LEGENDARY BOUNTY HUNTER
TELPISCOREI AND WIFE.

337
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:29,083
I WON'T BE ABLE TO GIVE HIM
YOUR THANKS FOR A WHILE.

338
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:30,875
I'M AFRAID HE'S DOING
ALL HIS BOUNTY HUNTING

339
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:34,291
UP IN HEAVEN THESE DAYS.

340
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,333
I SEE.

341
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,083
THE REST IS
FOR YOUR HUSBAND.

342
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:42,750
I'M SURE THAT HE'S GOT
A HANGOVER UP THERE.

343
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:45,000
TREAT HIM TO
A PRAIRIE OYSTER ON ME.

344
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:30,375
ONCE IN A WHILE,
I DO THE PREVIEW MYSELF.

345
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:33,041
I'M JET BLACK,
36 YEARS OLD.

346
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,625
I'M OFTEN TOLD
I DON'T LOOK 36,

347
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:37,708
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T JUDGE
PEOPLE BASED ON APPEARANCES

348
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:39,500
OR HOW MUCH HAIR THEY HAVE.

349
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:42,666
THINGS ARE NEVER
WHAT THEY SEEM TO BE.

350
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,875
THAT'S HOW
THE NEXT EPISODE IS, TOO.

351
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:47,500
IT'S A STORY THAT SEEMS
VERY UNLIKE BEBOP.

352
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:49,958
NEXT EPISODE
"WALTZ FOR VENUS."

353
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:52,625
STUFF LIKE THIS IS GOOD
ONCE IN A WHILE, HUH?
