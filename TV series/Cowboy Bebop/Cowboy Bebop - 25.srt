HUH?

189
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,208
A MAN INJURES
HIS LEG DURING A HUNT.

190
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,583
HE'S IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE SAVANNA.

191
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,791
NO MEANS TO TREAT THE WOUND.

192
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,791
THE LEG ROTS
AND DEATH APPROACHES.

LAST MINUTE HE'S
PICKED UP BY AN AIRPLANE.

194
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:34,958

A LAND OF PURE WHITE BELOW HIM,

IT'S THE SUMMIT OF
A SNOWCAPPED MOUNTAIN.

197
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,583
THE MOUNTAIN IS KILIMANJARO.

198
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:45,666
AS HE GAZES DOWN, HE FEELS
THE LIFE FLOWING OUT OF HIM,

199
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:50,166
AND HE THINKS,
"THAT'S WHERE I WAS HEADED."

00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,708
AND?

201

I HATE STORIES LIKE THAT.

202

MEN ONLY THINK ABOUT THE PAST
RIGHT BEFORE THEIR DEATH,

203
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,041
AS IF THEY WERE
SEARCHING FRANTICALLY

204

YOU SAID THAT
YOU HAD DIED ONCE.

208

WHY CAN'T YOU JUST LET IT GO?

211
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,375
THERE WAS A WOMAN.

FIRST TIME I FOUND SOMEONE
THAT WAS TRULY ALIVE.

213

AT LEAST,
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

LOST SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY...
