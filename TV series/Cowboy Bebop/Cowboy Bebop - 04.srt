MISSILE NOW, RIGHT?

314
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,208
YEAH, BUT THERE'S NOT MUCH TIME.

315
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,875
THEY'RE AT ONE
OF THE GATE EXITS.

316
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,583
I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT.

317
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,333
ORDER UP THE DEFENSE SYSTEM!

318
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,041
4 MINUTES 30 SECONDS TO IMPACT.

319
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,583
THE SYSTEM WON'T BE READY!

320
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:47,958
HURRY! THIS IS AN EMERGENCY!
GET THE PRESIDENT ON THE LINE!

00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:54,291
THEY'RE RIGHT UP AHEAD.

322
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,416
OH, SHIT! IT SPLIT!

323
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:23,083
JET! I GOT TWO!
LOCK ON THE OTHER ONE!

324
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,625
WHAT? THERE ARE
NO WEAPONS ONLINE.

325
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,083
THAT MISSILE
WILL HIT GANYMEDE

326
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,125
BEFORE I HAVE
A CHANCE TO RECHARGE.

327
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,375
HEY THERE, HAVING
A LITTLE TROUBLE?

--OK, I GET THE 60!

JUST DO IT!

334
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:53,500
DAMN! THERE'S NO TIME LEFT!

335
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,708

CLOSE UP THE STARGATE.

DIDN'T YOU PAY ATTENTION IN
YOUR HIGH SCHOOL PHYSICS CLASS?

354
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,541
MATTER THAT GETS
ENCLOSED IN HYPERSPACE

355
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,500
CAN BE VIEWED
NORMALLY BY THE NAKED EYE.

356
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,541
BUT OF COURSE,
IT CAN NEVER INTERACT

357
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:28,875
WITH THE MATTER ON
THIS PLANE OF REALITY.

YEAH, YEAH, ALL THAT
WORK AND NO REWARD.

365
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,291
FOR TOUGH GUYS,
YOU SURE COMPLAIN A LOT.

NOW, DON'T TAKE IT
SO HARD, BOYS.

MAN... SHE'S TAKING
A SHOWER IN OUR SHOWER.

THERE IS NO MUSIC BOX!
