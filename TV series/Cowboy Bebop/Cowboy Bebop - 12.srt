00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,250
I TRULY PITY HER FOR THAT.

318
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:19,458
IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO NEEDS
PITY HERE, IT'S YOU.

319
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:25,125
WE STILL HAVEN'T SETTLED
THE SCORE FROM LAST TIME.

320
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,916
--MAKE YOUR MOVE.

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
UNH...

[GRUNTING]

323
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,916
LIN, GET OUT OF THE WAY.

324
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,666
JULIA WAS HERE,
RIGHT IN THIS TOWN.

325
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,958
UGH!

326
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,541
STEP ASIDE, LIN.

327
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,541
LIN...

328
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,000
OH!

329
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:06,875
A WOMAN? WHICH ONE ARE YOU?!

330
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:15,916
I'M BOTH AT ONCE,
AND I'M NEITHER ONE.

331
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,541
OHH...

332
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,625
[THUD]

333
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:35,083
HMM.

334
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,333
HEY, HOW ARE
MEN AND WOMEN DIFFERENT?

335
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:30,708
HMM. I THINK WOMEN ARE HIDING
MORE VITAL SECRETS THAN MEN ARE.

336
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:34,666
UHHUH, BUT THERE ARE WOMEN
WHO AREN'T FEMININE.

337
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,458
AND MEN WHO AREN'T MASCULINE.

338
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,458
WHAT ABOUT THOSE WHO
AREN'T USUALLY FEMININE

339
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:42,083
BUT SHOW THAT SIDE OF THEMSELVES
IN SOME CHANCE CIRCUMSTANCE?

340
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:43,208
I LIKE THAT.

341
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:45,708
--REALLY?
--I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU.

342
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:47,708
--WHO, THEN?
--MAYBE IT'S ME!

343
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:48,791
HA HA HA!
