00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.227
[XUNYU sighs]

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:20.938
[CANGLONG grunting]

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.739
Uh... Uh! Many thanks,
Master Xunyu!

00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:32.574
[XUNYU]
You're up early, Cang.

00:00:32.616 --> 00:00:35.285
[CANGLONG] Yes, but not
as early as you, Master.

00:00:35.327 --> 00:00:36.828
[XUNYU]
All this "Master" business

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.414
is most unsettling
coming from you.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:42.084
Wait. Something
about this stinks.

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:44.711
[gasps] But, this robe is clean.

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:47.130
At least it ought to be.

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:50.342
[XUNYU]
Cang. Do me a favor and bow.

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:53.178
Oh! Sure thing!

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.930
Huh...?

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:02.020
I missed! Sorry, boss!

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:05.065
No, you didn't.
The bullet was deflected.

00:01:05.107 --> 00:01:06.650
Good try though.

00:01:06.692 --> 00:01:08.360
But how?

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:12.698
[ELDRIDGE] If I had to guess,
they're a Huang He Superior Job.

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:17.035
No biggie. For I am Eldridge,
the King of Burglary,

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:19.496
leader of the PK group
Goblin Street.

00:01:19.538 --> 00:01:21.540
None are above me!

00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:25.544
Greater Takeover, set!

00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:28.630
Just a little closer and
they'll be within firing range.

00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:30.382
Then, it'll be adios to their...

00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:33.552
[gasps] She left the cart?

00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:36.263
[groaning]

00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:37.180
[BANDITS gasping]

00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:38.390
[NEEALA]
Boss! What happened?

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:43.562
[ELDRIDGE gagging]
That's not possible...

00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:46.607
I was... robbed...?

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:49.985
Eldridge.

00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:54.406
Where'd they...?

00:01:54.448 --> 00:01:58.076
[BANDITS gasping]

00:01:58.118 --> 00:01:59.703
Pathetic.

00:02:08.253 --> 00:02:11.840
[XUNYU sighs] If this is any
indication, perhaps I shouldn't

00:02:11.882 --> 00:02:14.968
expect much out of
the kingdom's Superiors.

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:50.647
[RAY] Well, we learned a couple
things about the gauntlets.

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.691
When you use the
Grudge conversion skill,

00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:54.109
it absorbs negative emotions

00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:57.237
and converts them into
usable MP and SP.

00:03:57.279 --> 00:03:58.530
[NEMESIS]
You said it.

00:03:58.572 --> 00:04:03.201
I thought Silver's Wind Hoof
only allowed for air travel.

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:07.038
But when combined with Grudge
Conversion, watch out.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.415
Yeah, right?

00:04:08.457 --> 00:04:12.919
We've got the mud to prove it.
Can't use that ability in town.

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:16.506
[NEMESIS] Mm. You'd go
right onto the wanted list.

00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:18.008
Are you almost done in there?

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.135
When do I get a turn?

00:04:20.177 --> 00:04:23.180
We're gonna be late meeting up
with Marie and the others.

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:26.099
Some advice. When rushing
a woman through a bath,

00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:29.186
be aware you're
on a deadly path.

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:32.647
[MARIE] You want to find
different ways to get stronger?

00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:40.030
And any advice so we can get
revenge on the Superior Killer.

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:42.073
What makes you
think I can help?

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:44.910
You've been playing <i>Dendro</i>
a lot longer than I have.

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:46.536
You must've experienced a ton.

00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:48.330
Oh, you'd better
believe it, kid!

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:51.333
Nothing helps you put in lots of
game time like unemployment.

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:53.001
You almost sound proud of that.

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:54.586
Ahem!

00:04:54.628 --> 00:04:56.671
Ray, be honest and
tell me what you think

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:58.632
your greatest weakness is.

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:01.635
I would say my weapon
range is too short,

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:05.388
and things go to hell really
fast if I misuse Nemesis.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.140
True, but in addition,

00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:09.518
you need to improve both
your speed and endurance.

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:12.604
Level up and find ways to
raise both of those stats.

00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:13.980
You know what? You were right.

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:15.941
It does feel good
helping people out.

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:17.818
Just a sec!
I'm not doubting you,

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:19.820
but surely there's
gotta be more!

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:22.364
Well, things can get
more complex, sure,

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:24.825
but that comes later.
The most direct way

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:27.828
to have an advantage is
by achieving balance.

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:31.206
I can't specialize in offense
and focus on strength?

00:05:31.248 --> 00:05:33.166
[MARIE]
Not if you wanna stay alive.

00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:35.544
Each stat is crucial
in its own way.

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:38.296
Raw power's great and all,
but if you're slow and squishy,

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:40.549
an opponent who isn't
will take you down, fast.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.300
Then I've got
lots of work to do.

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.052
They say that
the Superior Killer has

00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:46.346
a high‐agility Superior Job.

00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:48.098
Increase your speed
and endurance,

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.434
and you'll stand a
chance against them.

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:54.521
In terms of life skills,
drawing, martial arts,

00:05:54.563 --> 00:05:55.856
whatever you do
in the real world,

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:57.607
will be reflected in this world.

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:01.111
I didn't realize that.
No wonder my brother's OP.

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:05.407
Of course, there's also
your Embryo's ultimate skill.

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:06.700
Yeah?

00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:10.036
An ability with powerful effects
that reflect characteristics

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:11.955
unique to the one who wields it.

00:06:11.997 --> 00:06:14.916
Similarly, the name of the
attack is one of a kind,

00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.961
matching your specific Embryo.

00:06:18.003 --> 00:06:20.088
So for me, it'd be "Nemesis."

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.756
Correct, the only catch is,

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:24.843
the earliest you can learn it
is after attaining a high rank.

00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:26.553
How high, I wonder.

00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:28.388
Wait. Are you saying
yours already learned

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.723
its ultimate skill?

00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:31.558
Hm. Not that you mention it,

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.643
I've never even seen
Marie's Embryo.

00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:37.439
Mine is not as cool as you,
but if you really want to know,

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.566
the name of it is Arc‐en‐Ciel.

00:06:39.608 --> 00:06:42.360
Isn't that French, I think
it means "rainbow."

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:46.364
As for its type, well,
obviously it's, uh...

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:47.949
[NEMESIS, RAY]
Hm...?

00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:50.493
[ROOK] Finally. Hope we
didn't keep you waiting.

00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:52.495
Babi's absolutely starving.

00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:53.455
Good morning, you two.

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:55.707
[MARIE] A very good
morning to you both!

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:57.459
Babi! Rook! Please take a seat!

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.752
Did I hear right? You're hungry?

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:01.129
Breakfast is on me! I'll
just go up to the counter!

00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:05.216
And order for us! Yeah!
No need to follow me!

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:06.843
[ROOK]
Hmm...

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:14.017
[MARIE] By the way, these
tickets are for the both of you.

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:16.686
I used what was left over
from Gardranda's bounty

00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:17.896
to get ahold of them.

00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:19.940
The Clash of the Superiors.

00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:22.776
Figaro will be there.
Who's his opponent?

00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:25.070
The second ranked player
in Huang He's duels.

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:27.405
Xunyu, the Master Jiangshi.

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:29.532
I'm down to see this match‐up!

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:31.785
Swell. Then we'll go our
different ways now

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:34.037
and meet right before the
brawl's about to begin.

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:35.038
It's a deal.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.666
So what do you plan on doing
in the meantime, Ray?

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:39.960
I should probably swing
by the Adventurers' Guild

00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:42.629
and collect my reward.
What about you?

00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:46.007
There's a small matter I need
to stay and discuss with Marie.

00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:47.676
And that would be...?

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:49.010
[gasps]

00:07:49.052 --> 00:07:51.388
But how the heck did you...
there's no possible way...

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:52.889
[RAY]
What'd you say?

00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:54.182
I won't tell.

00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:56.601
[RAY]
Something's fishy about this.

00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:59.396
Eighty million lir for defeating
the Gouz‐Maise Gang

00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:02.649
seems like overkill.
Even if it was a challenge.

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:04.818
Yeah, there must've
been some bonus awards

00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:06.277
thrown into the mix.

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:08.947
I wouldn't even know
what to do with all this.

00:08:08.989 --> 00:08:11.449
Part of this money
belongs to Hugo.

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:12.993
Agreed.

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:14.577
[RAY]
I am not gonna touch a coin

00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:16.913
until I can divide it with him.

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:24.295
[music playing]

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:25.505
[CHILDREN laughing, chattering]

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:29.509
[SHU] Now, now, kids.
No pushing, grizz.

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:34.597
Wow. You do parties, big bro?

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:38.018
[SHU] Hm? Now, who could
have fur‐seen this?

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:40.437
Well, if it isn't Ray
and Nemesis!

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:43.940
Hey, Brother Bear! Feels
like it's been a while!

00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:46.651
[SHU] Sorry, kiddos, but
it's time fur Mister Bear

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:48.361
to get a move on, grizz!

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:50.238
Before I leave, though...

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.282
Who wants some candy?

00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:55.201
[CHILDREN cheering]

00:08:55.243 --> 00:08:58.413
[SHU] Let's find a nearby
cafÃ© to pop into, grizz.

00:08:58.455 --> 00:09:01.416
Yeah. I... Uh?

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:05.962
[RAY] Uh, bro. I think
your toupee's alive.

00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:06.880
[LEVIATHAN]
Pardon me.

00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:08.214
[SHU]
Grizz?

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:15.388
You'll have to excuse Behemoth
if she caused you any trouble.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.349
Behem... You mean
this porcupine?

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:19.225
Indeed.

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:21.352
[SHU] Welp, time to
get down, 'lil missy.

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:22.854
Looks like your
ride's here, grizz!

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:24.439
[BEHEMOTH]
XD!

00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:27.317
You heard the bear.
Let's be on our way.

00:09:27.358 --> 00:09:29.152
[BEHEMOTH whines]

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:34.741
Sorry for the inconvenience.

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:36.242
[SHU]
Be‐fur you go...

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:39.245
[CROWD applauding]

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:41.956
[SHU]
A little parting gift, grizz!

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:46.669
Much appreciated.

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:48.421
[BEHEMOTH]
TY!

00:09:54.385 --> 00:09:56.596
You okay?

00:09:56.638 --> 00:09:58.681
Oh, yeah. It was nothing.

00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:01.434
After all, she did
have her Embryo.

00:10:01.476 --> 00:10:04.062
Well, are you satisfied,
Behemoth?

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:05.355
[BEHEMOTH]
Lol!

00:10:05.396 --> 00:10:07.232
I thought you'd be.

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:08.274
When you saw that bear,

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:10.985
you were absolutely
committed to hugging him.

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:13.947
Likewise, I hope you get
everything you want

00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:15.740
out of the fight later today.

00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:17.158
Yep‐yep!

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.409
[LEVIATHAN]
As for me,

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:20.745
I hope this nation can
produce a worthy Superior.

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:22.288
[BEHEMOTH]
Hype!

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:32.799
Where have you
been all my life?

00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:34.676
So what brings you
out to Gideon?

00:10:34.717 --> 00:10:37.053
Are you here for the
Clash of the Superiors?

00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:38.638
[SHU]
You betcha, grizz!

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.058
Specifically, to support
my buddy, Figgy.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.102
Have I met him? Hold on.

00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:47.272
Like Figaro?
So you two are friends?

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:49.858
[SHU] Is that the reason
you came here, too, grizz?

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:52.902
Yeah.

00:10:52.944 --> 00:10:56.406
[SHU] Impressive! You're
in the box seats, grizz!

00:10:56.447 --> 00:10:57.240
Hm?

00:10:57.282 --> 00:10:58.408
Something up?

00:10:58.449 --> 00:11:01.870
[SHU] What a crazy coincidence.
We're sitting in the same box.

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:04.747
Which means we can watch
the fight together, grizz.

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:07.167
The universe smiles
upon us again!

00:11:07.208 --> 00:11:11.045
[SHU] I couldn't help but notice
that sick pair of kicks.

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:12.338
In a short amount of time,

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.300
you've been staying
beary busy adventuring.

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:18.511
It's not every day a player
beats two UBMs back‐to‐back,

00:11:18.553 --> 00:11:21.097
especially so soon
after joining, grizz.

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:22.932
Nom, nom, nom.

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:23.808
[gulps]

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.643
Though, now that
I'm remembering,

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:27.228
Figgy and I defeated our first

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:30.940
when we were bearly starting
out in our low‐rank jobs.

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:33.985
Like a couple of newbs,
no offense, we got lost,

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:37.697
ran into a pair of UBMs and
ended up having to fight.

00:11:37.739 --> 00:11:41.242
There were two. So you
and Figaro teamed up then?

00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:43.953
[SHU] Nah. More like
we each took on a UBM.

00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:45.413
One‐on‐one.

00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:47.040
[RAY]
Shuichi joined on launch day,

00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:49.250
which mean he was probably
one of the first Masters

00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:51.794
to defeat a Unique Boss Monster.

00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:54.464
Just how many hours are you
logged in on a given day?

00:11:54.505 --> 00:11:56.257
[SHU]
Hey! I live a healthy lifestyle!

00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:58.009
I always get my three squares,

00:11:58.051 --> 00:11:59.552
fit in shower and
bathroom breaks,

00:11:59.594 --> 00:12:03.932
and do an hour‐long workout sesh
to keep up my physique, grizz.

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:06.184
Every other moment's
spent in <i>Dendro</i>?

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:07.769
That's a huge chunk of time!

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.772
[SHU] Speaking of which,
places to be, people to meet.

00:12:10.813 --> 00:12:12.190
Catch you later, grizz.

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:17.111
Introduce me to that friend of
yours whenever we see them next.

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:19.864
Does your brother not
have to work or anything?

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:23.826
Well, he did win an overseas
lottery a while back.

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:26.829
Invested in some apartment
buildings, retired,

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:29.457
and has been living off
the rent money ever since.

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:33.044
Yeah. My brother's background
is all over the map.

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:35.755
He showed early promise
as a child actor and singer,

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:38.299
and just as he was rising in
the entertainment industry,

00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:40.385
he quit and became
a martial artist.

00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:44.639
After that he worked
as a university TA.

00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:47.225
That's all over the
place, all right.

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:52.730
[CYCO]
Not half bad.

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:56.401
Cyco! But... the last bite's
always the best one!

00:12:56.442 --> 00:12:57.402
I concur.

00:12:57.443 --> 00:12:59.153
Hugo. Is he...?

00:12:59.195 --> 00:13:00.405
On his way up.

00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:01.572
[NEMESIS, RAY]
Huh?

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.743
Did you miss me?

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:08.830
I knew we'd meet again,
though our safe reunion

00:13:08.871 --> 00:13:10.915
was only possible
because of you.

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:13.084
I couldn't have done
that quest without you.

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:15.920
Which reminds me, you and I
have something to discuss.

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:17.297
[HUGO]
Most unexpected.

00:13:17.338 --> 00:13:20.883
To think, the prize money ended
up being a small fortune.

00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:23.386
If you're free, I'd
like to divvy it up.

00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:28.266
There's no need, but I suppose
that answer won't do.

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:31.269
We were a team. You earned
half of the prize money.

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:34.022
Give me a quarter and the
whole matter will be settled.

00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:35.440
[RAY grumbles]

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.234
[HUGO]
Consider my share received.

00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:41.863
Not greedy, are you? You
could've easily kept it all.

00:13:41.904 --> 00:13:44.157
I would never knowingly
lie to a friend!

00:13:44.198 --> 00:13:45.700
[gasps]

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:52.248
Hugo, is it safe wandering
around town in your uniform?

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.625
That shows you're in
the Dryfe army, right?

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:55.877
What, this?

00:13:55.918 --> 00:14:00.798
It's a Driver uniform for my
clan, the Triangle of Wisdom.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.093
Fortunately, wearing it
shouldn't cause a problem.

00:14:04.135 --> 00:14:07.180
Good to hear. By the way,

00:14:07.221 --> 00:14:09.849
why'd you align with Dryfe
in the first place?

00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:12.810
I already knew someone
who had started out there.

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:15.938
They were also the person
that got me into the clan.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.648
[RAY]
Makes total sense.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:21.527
Now then, it's my turn
to ask you something.

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:23.738
I want all the details
about yesterday's battle

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.281
against Gouz‐Maise.

00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:28.159
Sure! You bet!

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.705
Well, guess it's
about that time.

00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:33.956
[HUGO]
Going somewhere?

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:35.625
Yeah. We got tickets

00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:38.586
to watch the Clash of the
Superiors at the arena.

00:14:38.628 --> 00:14:40.254
Are you gonna be there?

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:43.383
Uh. Sure. You could say that.

00:14:43.424 --> 00:14:46.886
Great then, maybe
we'll see you around!

00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:51.516
I'm sure we'll meet
again real soon.

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:54.435
Until then, bye Cyco.

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:55.353
[HUGO]
Mm. Ray.

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:57.021
[RAY]
Hm? What's up?

00:14:57.063 --> 00:14:58.940
[HUGO] If you could,
there's something I want you

00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:00.233
to keep in the
back of your mind.

00:15:00.274 --> 00:15:01.192
[RAY]
Hm?

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:02.693
Look to the west.

00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:04.695
Uh. Say what?

00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:07.573
I'm sorry if I sounded
melodramatic.

00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:10.034
I meant Figaro, the favorite
for today's match,

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:11.828
should be entering
from the west.

00:15:11.869 --> 00:15:14.163
Yeah? Thanks, Hugo.

00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:16.582
[HUGO]
No problem. Goodbye, Ray.

00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:19.127
[RAY]
Yep! Catch ya later.

00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:26.843
If I heard you right, you
leaked sensitive information.

00:15:26.884 --> 00:15:28.177
Perhaps I did.

00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:31.681
It's almost like you're
sabotaging the plan.

00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:33.975
It seems that way, doesn't it?

00:15:34.016 --> 00:15:37.895
Obviously, I want to
fulfill his desires.

00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:41.983
At the same time, I can't turn
my back on a woman in distress.

00:15:42.024 --> 00:15:44.360
Pulled in different directions.

00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:47.071
I couldn't stay silent,
so I spoke up.

00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:49.115
End of the story.

00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:51.492
From now on, I'll act my part.

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:55.746
Then I'll be standing
beside you, acting as well.

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:57.582
Thanks, Cyco.

00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:05.548
[CANGLONG coughing]

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.967
Sorry, Master Xunyu.

00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:11.971
I wanted to be there,
cheering you on.

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:13.890
But I don't think
that's happening.

00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:15.099
[XUNYU]
Don't push yourself.

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:17.351
Remain here and
continue to rest.

00:16:17.393 --> 00:16:19.645
Whatever you need, your
highness, I'm here for you!

00:16:19.687 --> 00:16:21.147
Should I change out
your ice pack?

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:23.274
Or how about some vitamin C?

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:26.652
I'll survive, but Master,
you should leave for Gideon.

00:16:26.694 --> 00:16:29.655
[XUNYU]
Oh, is it that time already?

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.366
[CHAMBERLAIN]
I thought I heard a noise!

00:16:32.408 --> 00:16:35.286
Highness! Are you, um...

00:16:36.704 --> 00:16:40.124
No. Please. Flying?
Anything but that.

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:41.834
[XUNYU]
It will get chilly so make sure

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:43.669
to close the window behind us.

00:16:43.711 --> 00:16:44.712
What?

00:16:44.754 --> 00:16:48.925
[XUNYU] Well, ambassador, shall
we make our way to Gideon?

00:16:48.966 --> 00:16:50.635
Try not to bite your tongue.

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:54.013
Wait! I can walk!
It's no problem, really!

00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:55.681
[MEIHAI screams]

00:16:56.724 --> 00:17:01.062
Bye Master and Meihai.
Please be safe.

00:17:01.103 --> 00:17:02.730
[FRANKLIN] Good evening,
Your Excellency.

00:17:02.772 --> 00:17:05.399
There's been a slight
change of plans.

00:17:05.441 --> 00:17:08.444
Turns out they won't
be attending, so...

00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:11.364
...the Queen of Monsters
is out of play for now.

00:17:11.405 --> 00:17:13.824
I realize they are the most
powerful within the Empire

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:15.451
and their absence
makes a huge difference,

00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:18.621
but it simply can't be helped.

00:17:18.663 --> 00:17:21.666
Between the three of us, we'll
take a majority of the battles.

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:24.544
Plus, don't forget
about the defectors.

00:17:24.585 --> 00:17:27.797
I estimate a...
90% success rate.

00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:28.714
Huh?

00:17:28.756 --> 00:17:31.509
And if a Superior shows
up we didn't count on?

00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:35.596
Then I'd say our odds
are roughly 50%.

00:17:35.638 --> 00:17:39.016
[FRANKLIN laughs]
You thought they'd be lower?

00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:42.144
You crack me up,
your Excellency!

00:17:42.186 --> 00:17:45.273
Or did you forget who
you were talking to?

00:17:45.314 --> 00:17:48.526
Ha, ha! Besides, we can always
choose a different target

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:51.070
or tweak the plan a
fraction here and there.

00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:55.908
With a little prayer, we may
be able to pull this off.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.368
[FRANKLIN]
Even though he's not here,

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:01.872
I've still got my favorite.
And considering his Embryo...

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:04.208
It wouldn't surprise me
in the least if he killed

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:07.920
all the Masters in
Gideon by himself.

00:18:10.214 --> 00:18:12.758
[JULIET]
Blackwing Orchestra!

00:18:14.218 --> 00:18:17.888
[CHELSEA]
World Reversal Waterfall!

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:22.351
[JULIET yelling]

00:18:22.393 --> 00:18:25.021
[CHELSEA grunting]

00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:33.446
Their levels are up there.

00:18:33.487 --> 00:18:34.280
Yeah.

00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:37.533
Both the competitors are Masters
with Sixth Form Embryos.

00:18:37.575 --> 00:18:40.703
The girl with the wings is
Juliet, the Fallen Knight,

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:43.998
versus Chelsea the Great Pirate.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.543
[RAY] Wait, so you mean she's
still considered a knight?

00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:51.797
I feel some kind of bond,
even if her gear is terrifying.

00:18:51.839 --> 00:18:54.342
Have you taken a look
in the mirror lately?

00:18:54.383 --> 00:18:55.217
[RAY]
Uh.

00:18:55.259 --> 00:18:58.679
Looks like she's preparing
to shut this match down!

00:19:14.403 --> 00:19:17.448
[JULIET]
Hraesvelgr!

00:19:18.866 --> 00:19:20.660
Poseidon!

00:19:24.038 --> 00:19:25.831
Those must be their
ultimate skills,

00:19:25.873 --> 00:19:27.708
the ones named
after their Embryos.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:28.876
[MARIE]
Indeed.

00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:32.922
Juliet used Hraesvelgr, which is
a Dark‐Wind combo magic attack.

00:19:32.963 --> 00:19:35.675
Whereas Chelsea's Poseidon
is a physical attack

00:19:35.716 --> 00:19:38.094
that summons molten gold.

00:19:45.643 --> 00:19:48.229
[CROWD cheering]

00:19:49.438 --> 00:19:53.609
[RAY] So this is the power
of an ultimate skill!

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:57.738
[RAY]
Hm? Is that Shu? Why is he...?

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:02.618
[NEMESIS] I don't see
Brother Bear anywhere.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.079
You'd think he'd be
easier to spot.

00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:07.540
[SHU] I know for a fact
that guy from Caldina

00:20:07.581 --> 00:20:10.000
and Dryfe's King of Beasts
are in the audience.

00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:12.253
[FIGARO] Seems I've captured
their attention.

00:20:12.294 --> 00:20:15.256
[SHU] Also, something fishy's
going on in town.

00:20:15.297 --> 00:20:17.383
I've noticed an odd
crowd hanging around

00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:19.719
that supposedly works
for the kingdom.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.638
No telling what they're
hiding up their sleeves.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.265
Keep your guard up.

00:20:24.306 --> 00:20:26.434
[FIGARO]
Ha. Who, me?

00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:29.061
[NEMESIS] Find something? How
come you're sneaking around?

00:20:29.103 --> 00:20:30.354
Heh!

00:20:30.396 --> 00:20:31.272
[BOTH]
Hmm?

00:20:31.313 --> 00:20:32.356
[SHU]
Hey!

00:20:32.398 --> 00:20:36.652
[FIGARO] Well, look who
it is... Ray and Nemesis!

00:20:36.694 --> 00:20:39.822
[RAY] So, what's with
the get‐up, Figaro?

00:20:39.864 --> 00:20:42.491
Simple. I'm well‐known
in this town.

00:20:42.533 --> 00:20:44.702
A disguise helps
avoid attention.

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:47.288
[NEMESIS] I heard a rumor
the two of you were friends,

00:20:47.329 --> 00:20:49.749
but close enough
to be cosplay pals?

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.834
That's serious friendship.

00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:55.463
Us? Friends? Yeah, I suppose.

00:20:55.504 --> 00:20:57.173
Guess you could
also say colleagues,

00:20:57.214 --> 00:20:58.632
seeing how we're
this nation's Su‐‐

00:20:58.674 --> 00:21:02.261
[SHU] Suavest representatives
of the Costume‐Lovers' Club!

00:21:02.303 --> 00:21:05.014
Guilty as charged!

00:21:05.055 --> 00:21:06.557
Not to change the subject,

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:09.894
but I forgot to give you
this at lunch today, grizz.

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:10.978
What is it?

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.772
[SHU]
It's called a Telepathy Cuff.

00:21:12.813 --> 00:21:14.273
When two friends
have one equipped,

00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:17.193
they can chat across
long distances.

00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:20.070
Oh, man. This will
definitely come in handy.

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:21.947
[FIGARO] I've got something
for you too, Ray.

00:21:21.989 --> 00:21:23.073
You do?

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:27.036
A tip, if you're a gambling
man. Bet on me today.

00:21:27.077 --> 00:21:28.162
Thanks for the heads‐up.

00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:30.790
[SHU] I've gotta chat with Figgy
here a little while longer.

00:21:30.831 --> 00:21:33.375
Go on ahead. I'll catch up.

00:21:33.417 --> 00:21:35.377
Cool. See ya soon.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.506
I've gotta say,
I'm a little surprised

00:21:38.547 --> 00:21:40.216
you haven't told
him the truth yet.

00:21:40.257 --> 00:21:41.509
[SHU]
Never mind that.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:44.762
First, not to bruise your ego,
but from where I'm standing,

00:21:44.804 --> 00:21:47.473
the odds of you
winning are 50/50.

00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:49.850
And that's me being optimistic.

00:21:49.892 --> 00:21:52.436
I kinda figured that
those were my chances,

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.855
seeing how I'm facing off
against one of the mighty

00:21:54.897 --> 00:21:57.733
Huang He Si Ling, the
empire's greatest four.

00:21:57.775 --> 00:22:00.945
[SHU] Fighting the Kingdom of
Altar's mightiest solo player,

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:03.197
Figaro the Endless Chain.

00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:05.074
[FIGARO] Should make for
an interesting match.

00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:07.201
Wish I was in the
stands to see it.

00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:08.661
[SHU]
Don't be like that.

00:22:08.702 --> 00:22:10.704
[FIGARO]
I'm joking, of course.

00:22:10.746 --> 00:22:13.499
Moments like this are
precisely what I live for.

00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:16.252
Why I joined Dendro
in the first place.

00:22:16.293 --> 00:22:20.214
To win, by not holding
anything back.

00:23:52.556 --> 00:23:54.892
[RAY]
"Clash of the Superiors."
