WEBVTT

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:14.640
All right.

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.808
How 'bout 60 million lir on‐‐

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.268
[NEMESIS]
Are you insane?

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.229
You're not doing anything
else until I sit you down

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.856
and teach you a lesson on
the value of money! Okay?

00:00:22.898 --> 00:00:23.690
Ya know?

00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:25.692
It kinda feels like you
already taught me one.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:26.860
[XUNYU]
What a waste.

00:00:26.902 --> 00:00:28.445
[RAY gasps]

00:00:28.487 --> 00:00:32.199
[XUNYU] You'd have better luck
setting your money on fire.

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:34.910
Such ridiculous odds on Figaro.

00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:38.163
They're underestimating
the away team.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:43.168
I can almost feel
their bloodlust.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.712
That poor girl.

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:46.588
Nemesis!

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:47.839
Right!

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.640
[XUNYU]
So, what're are the odds on you?

00:00:56.682 --> 00:00:58.225
‐‐[RAY] Counte‐‐
‐‐[XUNYU] Too slow!

00:00:58.267 --> 00:01:01.687
[SHU]
Hit Paws! Grizz.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.397
[XUNYU]
And who might you be?

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:04.856
[RAY gasps]

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.945
[SHU]
Just your average passerbear.

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:46.500
[XUNYU] Well, you certainly
look powerful.

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:49.670
[SHU] Me? I'm just beary
enthusiastic about costumes.

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:53.590
[XUNYU laughs]
Let's see what you've got!

00:02:53.632 --> 00:02:55.050
[gasps]

00:02:55.092 --> 00:02:57.177
[XUNYU laughs]
What do ya know?

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:59.680
You managed to deflect my attack
even though your speed's

00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:01.431
nothing compared to mine.

00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:02.808
Altar may be dying,

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.518
but perhaps it
was worth the trip.

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:07.521
If Figaro's a bust,
there's always you.

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:09.773
[SHU] I assure you,
that won't happen.

00:03:09.815 --> 00:03:12.859
Since he's going
to take you down.

00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:14.444
Given how confident you are,

00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:19.241
you must be the man himself.
This ought to be good.

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:22.119
Hey, wait! Whoever she is,
don't hurt her!

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.162
Who're you talking about?

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:26.164
Hold on. You mean this?

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.500
She's bad with traveling by air.

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:31.837
Uh? Did you seriously stand up
to me because you thought

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:33.964
I was a kidnapper or something?

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:36.425
Oh, uh...

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:41.179
[laughing] First it was
the bear, and now you?

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:43.890
This country's sure got
its share of funny Masters.

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:45.308
[RAY gasps]

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.937
Let's meet up and play
together sometime.

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:50.063
Uhh...

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:52.941
What was that about?

00:03:52.983 --> 00:03:55.652
[XUNYU] Wake up, ambassador.
You have work to do.

00:03:55.694 --> 00:04:00.031
[MEIHAI grunting]
Huh...? Huh? Huh? Huh?

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:03.368
I'm begging you!
No more supersonic air travel.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.413
I don't think I can take it!

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:11.460
[SHU] You've got a strange way
of making new friends, grizz.

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:13.628
Bear in mind,
it's still a little early

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.756
for you to be
battling Superiors.

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:18.800
A Superior? Really?
You mean they...

00:04:18.842 --> 00:04:21.720
[SHU] Figaro's opponent, and one
of the four greatest players

00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:23.638
the land of
hermits has to offer.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.476
Xunyu, the Yinglong,
of the Huang He Si Ling.

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:31.271
[CROWD chattering]

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.106
[RAY]
We're back.

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:34.775
[SHU]
Pardon the intrusion. Grizz.

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:36.526
[ALL gasp]

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:40.197
Good to see you, Ray,
but uh... Who's the bear?

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:42.032
Oh, he's my brother.

00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:44.201
We just happened to get
seats in the same box.

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:45.994
[MARIE] I've got a funny
feeling about him.

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:48.413
I know it's a bear costume.
But who else would wear one?

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:50.582
And the voice is
familiar. Plus, bear!

00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:53.919
[ROOK] Marie? You seem kinda
nervous all of a sudden.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.297
Nervous? Whatever do you mean?
Heh... Ah.

00:04:57.339 --> 00:05:00.550
I know what's going on.

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:02.302
Obviously you're
afraid of bears.

00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:04.888
[gasps] Exactly right!
Scared to death!

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.224
And allergic,
to the real ones anyway.

00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:10.644
I mean, not like I'm afraid
of your brother or anything.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.232
Let's start over
with the introductions.

00:05:15.273 --> 00:05:17.734
Inside of the costume's
my older brother, Shu.

00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:19.319
[SHU]
Beary nice to meet you.

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:20.195
My name's Rook.

00:05:20.237 --> 00:05:21.488
And I'm Babi!

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.907
Right. My name is,
um, Marie Adler.

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.618
That's me. Pleased to, uh...

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.623
[SHU]
Hey. Did you say Marie Adler?

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:35.043
Beary interesting.

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:38.797
Hmm... Are you a Journalist,
by chance?

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:41.842
Uh? That's right.
But how'd you know?

00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:44.553
[SHU] I'm a fan of the manga,
too! Pretty good stuff.

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:45.887
What manga?

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:48.348
[SHU] <i>Into the Shadow.</i>
You should check it out!

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.308
Not like it'll bruin
the story for you,

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.937
but the protagonist is a
journalist named Marie Adler.

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.564
Yeah?

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:57.899
[SHU] Unfortunately,
it was discontinued after

00:05:57.941 --> 00:06:00.443
the first volume,
but I was hooked.

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:02.737
I've been waiting for
it to start up again.

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:06.324
Yeah, same here. Well,
nice to meet another fan.

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:07.742
[ANNOUNCER]
The wait is over!

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:10.412
It's time for the
main attraction!

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:15.709
Put your hands together for
the Clash of the Superiors!

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:16.960
[CROWD cheering]

00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:18.837
[ANNOUNCER]
First, out of the eastern gate,

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:21.673
a Superior hailing from
the land of Huang He!

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:25.343
The famed martial artist
known as the Yinglong!

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:32.976
The Master Jiangshi: Xunyu!

00:06:33.018 --> 00:06:35.896
[ROOK] So by the way, what sort
of job is "Master Jiangshi"?

00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:39.274
From what I hear, Huang He
have a role called "Daoshi."

00:06:39.316 --> 00:06:41.610
This is the Superior Job
version of that.

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:44.988
[ANNOUNCER] And from the west,
we have the pride of Gideon!

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.533
You know him as "the king"!
"The solitary explorer"!

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:50.368
A warrior without
equal who bears

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.915
both the title of Endless Chain
and Over Gladiator!

00:06:54.956 --> 00:07:00.670
Figaro!

00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:07.719
[CROWD]
Figaro! Figaro! Figaro...

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:09.888
[ANNOUNCER] By the sound of it,
you're ready to witness

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.348
the fight of the century.

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:14.267
But first, a brief summary
of what's not allowed.

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:17.187
Any accessories or items
that prevent instadeath.

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:19.648
As well as any
consumable healing items.

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:23.818
However, healing from equipment
skills is permitted.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.570
[SHU]
Figgy would've had an advantage

00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:27.530
if they allowed
accessories like that.

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:29.741
But if the rules are the
same for both fighters,

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:30.450
would it matter?

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:33.328
[SHU]
In Figgy's case, absolutely.

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:39.000
[ANNOUNCER] With the barrier in
place, we can begin with the‐‐

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:41.002
Wait, what's this?

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:43.088
[XUNYU]
One... Two...

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:44.965
Can you hear me all right?

00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:47.217
I'm about to duel
this Figaro guy.

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:50.553
But let me just say something
to make the fight interesting.

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:52.722
I won't take a single
step from this spot

00:07:52.764 --> 00:07:55.600
until my opponent's
on his knees.

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:57.268
[SPECTATOR A]
Are you serious?

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.937
[SPECTATOR B]
What you can do is go to hell!

00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:00.230
[SPECTATOR C]
Who do they think they are?

00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:05.485
[XUNYU laughs] Who am I?
Apparently the villain!

00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:07.821
[CROWD cheers]

00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:09.489
[ANNOUNCER]
On that dramatic note,

00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:12.951
it's time to start the
Clash of the Superiors!

00:08:12.993 --> 00:08:16.579
Let the fight begin!

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:23.712
[NEMESIS]
It's too fast!

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:26.464
[SHU] They got the barrier
settings all wrong.

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:27.716
What kind of settings?

00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:30.927
[SHU] The barrier surrounds the
fight and slows down the action,

00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:36.141
so it's easier for the
crowd to follow along.

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:39.185
But this isn't
your typical match.

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:41.604
[MARIE] No kidding.
To ensure the audience's safety,

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:44.357
they had to put five
barriers in place.

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:46.943
But players under level
50 and their attacks

00:08:46.985 --> 00:08:49.362
are able to pass right
through the buffer zone.

00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:51.781
Thus why they're not allowed
to battle in the arena.

00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:55.660
[ANNOUNCER] A thousand pardons.
Maybe this'll help.

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:05.003
[RAY] Figaro's completely
on the defensive.

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:08.131
So this is how a Superior
built for speed fights.

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:11.551
But that's the thing.
The Jiangshi are mages.

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:31.446
[RAY] Their arms are being
bombarded by their own attacks,

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:33.531
but they're not really
taking any damage.

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:37.494
[SHU] Which leads me to believe
they're a Superior Embryo.

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:39.913
Two characteristic
abilities stand out:

00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:42.957
Resilient arms and
tremendous speed.

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:48.713
[XUNYU]
Calling: Baolei!

00:09:56.054 --> 00:10:00.058
[XUNYU]
Zen‐ho, zen‐dong. Baolongba!

00:10:13.404 --> 00:10:14.948
Zero damage!

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:16.449
Was that an Embryo skill?

00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:18.243
[SHU]
Nope, it's from an item.

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:21.913
The long coat he's always
wearing is a Special Reward.

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:24.374
It allows him to block
any outside interference,

00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:25.834
for a short while.

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:30.088
Only drawback is it's got
a ten‐minute cooldown.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:33.550
Which means he used his
ultimate means of defense.

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:34.676
[MARIE]
Still, though.

00:10:34.717 --> 00:10:37.220
His opponent may be out
of viable moves.

00:10:37.262 --> 00:10:40.014
Magic that uses so many
Fu talismans to cast

00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:42.058
must be tough to recast.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.019
He may get the chance to attack
now, there's just one problem.

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.897
Figuring out what other
effect Xunyu's skill had.

00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:48.857
[GROUP gasps]

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:50.817
[ROOK]
"Tenaga Ashinaga."

00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:53.278
That's what they whispered
before creating those flames.

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:55.947
[SHU] Figgy's defensive
skill is wearing off.

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:04.080
[XUNYU] Seems I missed
targeting your heart.

00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:08.001
All I got was this damn lung!

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:12.422
[XUNYU laughs]

00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:23.099
[SHU] So that was the result of
all of Xunyu's groundwork.

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:24.225
[RAY]
Groundwork?

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:26.936
[SHU] Look. First, there was
the whole business about

00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:30.106
not moving a single step
till Figaro was down.

00:11:30.148 --> 00:11:34.402
Basically, a ruse to explain why
Xunyu wasn't using their legs.

00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:36.237
Yeah, then phase two.

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:39.407
The Fu and Elemental were
just a momentary distraction.

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:41.242
To set up the main spell,

00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:44.746
Baolei and Zhen‐ho Zhen‐dong
Baolongba, wasn't it?

00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:47.290
Based on power.
It's evidently one of the

00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:49.667
strongest Master
Jiangshi skills.

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.169
Perhaps the ultimate one.

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:52.670
My thoughts, too.

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:54.839
[SHU] Most powerful
omni‐directional defensive

00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:56.883
skills prevent
players from moving

00:11:56.925 --> 00:12:00.220
or being able to use
any other skills.

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:03.264
[RAY] Wait a second.
If Figaro's Special Reward cloak

00:12:03.306 --> 00:12:05.433
is able to block damage
in every direction,

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:07.894
there's no way an attack
should've ever reached him.

00:12:07.936 --> 00:12:11.022
[SHU] No attacks from
the outside, at least.

00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:13.566
Sounds to me like you may
have already figured out

00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:15.401
what the ultimate skill does.

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:18.154
[SHU] You seemed to have
guessed it as well, Rook.

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:20.406
Well, I've got a working theory.

00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:22.158
What sort of attack
could've inflicted

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.743
such a massive injury on him?

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:26.746
[SHU] Figgy lost an organ and
is spitting up a lotta blood.

00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:29.165
But there's not a
scratch on him, see?

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:31.668
For Embryos, their ultimate
skill is a culmination

00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:34.754
of characteristics.
No two are the same.

00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:35.630
That's right.

00:12:35.672 --> 00:12:38.716
And if Xunyu's happens to
be both speed and range,

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:40.718
the culmination of those is...

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.387
[SHU]
Warping.

00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:45.932
That skill's usually meant to be
used at a super‐long‐distance.

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:49.018
Must've been a pain to
make it viable in a duel.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.105
You're finally starting
to understand how I roll.

00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:54.732
How come neither one of
them is making a move?

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:57.694
Some kind of side‐effect
of the skill, maybe?

00:12:57.735 --> 00:13:00.154
[SHU]
No. Xunyu's just being cautious.

00:13:00.196 --> 00:13:01.823
You think so?

00:13:01.864 --> 00:13:04.284
[MARIE] Figaro's got
an ace up his sleeve.

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:07.370
He's managed to keep his
Superior Embryo a secret.

00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:09.038
Hasn't revealed it once so far.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.792
[SHU] Actually, he has
been using it all this time.

00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:13.751
[GROUP]
Uh?

00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:16.087
What do you mean,
"All this time"?

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:17.505
[SHU]
From the start of the match.

00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:18.339
[RAY]
Hm?

00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:19.799
Then you're saying his embryo's

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:21.342
a piece of equipment
he's wearing?

00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:23.052
That's not possible.

00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:25.054
I've been using my
Identification skill

00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:27.932
and the only things he
has equipped are items.

00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:31.311
[CROWD gasping]

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:37.608
Aw, was it that difficult
for you to catch a breath?

00:13:38.609 --> 00:13:41.279
[XUNYU]
This match ends now!

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:49.537
That's the same attack
and block pattern as before.

00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:53.207
[RAY] The same?
Even with only one lung?

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:54.292
[XUNYU yells]

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:57.170
[FIGARO yelling]

00:13:57.211 --> 00:14:00.798
Wait a sec. Why's he using
Physical Berserk now?

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.383
[XUNYU]
That's quite the expression

00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:04.844
you're making, Figaro!

00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:08.097
[XUNYU gasps]

00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:14.103
[FIGARO grunts]

00:14:16.397 --> 00:14:17.523
What have you done?

00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:18.816
[RAY]
No way.

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:20.026
What just happened?

00:14:20.068 --> 00:14:22.695
Nemesis. How many
equipment slots are there?

00:14:22.737 --> 00:14:24.530
How many for the
gladiator grouping?

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:27.200
I don't know for certain,
but it's more than paladins.

00:14:27.241 --> 00:14:29.744
There are skills that can
increase the number of slots,

00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:31.954
but I'd say it's
somewhere around 25.

00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:32.872
Hey, Bro!

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:33.956
[SHU]
What's up, grizz?

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:36.000
The gear that
Figaro has equipped,

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:37.460
do you know how they function?

00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:38.753
[SHU]
If memory serves,

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:41.672
they're items to boost
his strength and agility.

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:44.884
So, that's how it is.

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:47.095
[XUNYU]
He's even stronger!

00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:49.097
This goes against all logic.

00:14:49.138 --> 00:14:52.141
Who grows more powerful
by unequipping?

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:54.394
I've never seen this before.

00:14:54.435 --> 00:14:55.311
[RAY]
I got it!

00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:56.521
[SHU]
Yessir?

00:14:56.562 --> 00:14:58.064
[RAY]
I think I figured it out.

00:14:58.106 --> 00:15:00.942
Figaro's Embryo,
its ability powers up his gear,

00:15:00.983 --> 00:15:03.903
depending on how many items he
doesn't have equipped. Right?

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:05.363
[SHU]
Why do you think that?

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:07.907
Everybody here can
see it. I mean, look.

00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:10.118
Hardly any gear and
he's grown stronger.

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:11.994
[SHU]
That's all the proof you have?

00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:14.497
One more thing, you can't
normally explore

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:17.875
the Tomb Labyrinth solo.
But he was able to.

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:21.212
[SHU] Is it paw‐ssible because
of his Superior Embryo?

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:23.965
If that were true, other
Superiors would do it, too,

00:15:24.006 --> 00:15:26.676
but as far as I know,
he's the only one.

00:15:26.717 --> 00:15:29.679
And here's why. He has
something the others don't!

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.555
[SHU]
Which is?

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:32.473
Utility and countermeasures.

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:33.933
He starts out fully equipped,

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:35.518
gauging his
opponent's abilities,

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.395
then adjusts his
power ups mid‐battle

00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:39.730
depending on the
enemy's resistance.

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:40.857
[SHU]
You're halfway right.

00:15:40.898 --> 00:15:41.732
Oh, yeah?

00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:43.776
[SHU] Just so you know,
when he's fully geared,

00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:45.319
all his equipment's
starting numbers

00:15:45.361 --> 00:15:46.779
are multiplied by two.

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:47.780
They're doubled?

00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:51.033
Hey, Shu. But you didn't say
these are the starting stats.

00:15:51.075 --> 00:15:52.326
[SHU]
Right. That's the other part

00:15:52.368 --> 00:15:54.036
of his Embryo's unique trait.

00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:56.956
Those stats increase in
proportion to battle time.

00:15:56.998 --> 00:15:59.917
The longer the fight, the
more powerful he becomes.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.502
And there's no ceiling.

00:16:01.544 --> 00:16:04.839
I see. That's why he's
called the Endless Chain.

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:10.803
[XUNYU] Ha! You are really
something special, Figaro!

00:16:14.223 --> 00:16:16.184
Damn. I messed up!

00:16:16.225 --> 00:16:18.269
Should've aimed for the head
even if the risk of you

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:20.605
dodging the attack
would've been greater!

00:16:20.646 --> 00:16:25.067
[grunts, yells]

00:16:28.863 --> 00:16:32.742
[SHU] This is it!
Figaro's going in for the kill!

00:16:32.783 --> 00:16:35.703
My Identification's skill's
coming back with nothing.

00:16:35.745 --> 00:16:37.538
What weapon is that?

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.373
[SHU]
A Superior Item:

00:16:39.415 --> 00:16:43.085
The Zenith Dragon's Brilliant
Fang, Gloria Alpha.

00:16:43.127 --> 00:16:44.962
What? So that means...

00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:47.590
Yeah. It's on a whole
different level.

00:16:47.632 --> 00:16:54.931
[XUNYU laughs]
I have a toy of my own!

00:16:54.972 --> 00:16:57.475
Yinglong's Fang, Suling Yi.

00:16:57.517 --> 00:17:00.478
You're not the only one
with a Superior Item!

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.689
Still, not like I can surpass
you when you're so buffed.

00:17:03.731 --> 00:17:05.608
So I'll just have
to eclipse you.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.777
See, the more MP
and SP I give it,

00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:10.446
the more damage my Fang deals!

00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:13.324
I'm putting everything I
have into this one attack!

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:15.993
They'll be cleaning
you off the floor!

00:17:16.035 --> 00:17:18.454

I've got you now!

Whoa. Where'd that
claw come from?

00:17:56.617 --> 00:17:58.744
That speech about giving
it their all was a bluff!

00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:01.330
It one big setup up
for a surprise attack!

00:18:01.372 --> 00:18:02.915
But how could Figaro lose?

00:18:02.957 --> 00:18:06.669
[SHU] He didn't. Look closer.
The blade didn't pass through.

00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:09.839
My attack should've killed you!
Why are you still alive?

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.967
[SHU] It was stopped
dead in its tracks

00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:16.304

gone for the head!

Wow, that was a great duel!

It truly was a
wonderful fight.

You won't see another one
like it for a long time.

00:19:23.037 --> 00:19:25.373
Worth crossing the
desert, that's for sure.

00:19:25.414 --> 00:19:27.458
Oh, yeah? The desert?

Then you came all
the way from Caldina?

00:19:29.877 --> 00:19:34.340
Yes. Luckily, I'll have
a fine story when I return.

00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:35.716
Oh?

00:19:35.758 --> 00:19:38.344
Well, now...
Looks like it's starting.

00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:39.970
We spec.

00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:42.807
If you insist, we'll
continue to spectate.

00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:45.476
It might prove to
be entertaining.

00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:54.902
[RAY] Uh.
Is this supposed to be part‐‐

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:56.195
What's wrong?

00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:58.531
[SHU] Someone went and
did something stupid.

00:19:58.572 --> 00:20:00.783
Stopped time inside the barrier.

00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:06.247
[ROOK gasps]
Up in the sky! You see that?

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:08.040
[NEMESIS]
Not him!

00:20:08.082 --> 00:20:09.667
It's Doctor Flamingo!

00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:13.587
[FLAMINGO] Good evening,
ladies and gents!

00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:15.548
That was some fight, am I right?

00:20:15.589 --> 00:20:17.466
Unfortunately, it was
supposed to be followed up

00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:19.135
with the Count and
Princess boring you

00:20:19.176 --> 00:20:20.511
to death with some speech.

00:20:20.553 --> 00:20:23.764
Buut I say we skip the snooze
fest and do something fun!

00:20:23.806 --> 00:20:25.266
I've heard enough!

00:20:25.307 --> 00:20:28.269
Remove your costume and identify
yourself right this instant!

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:31.397
[FRANKLIN laughing]
You mean you don't recognize

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:36.777
my enchanting voice?
Okay then. Maybe this will help!

00:20:36.819 --> 00:20:40.239
Voila! Feast your eyes
on this prize specimen!

00:20:40.281 --> 00:20:41.949
Well? You like?

00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:44.577
I should've known.
Why're you here?

00:20:44.618 --> 00:20:47.204
[CROWD chattering]

00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:48.998
Color me embarrassed!

00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:50.958
You mean to tell me
all these fine people

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.169
have actually heard
about little old me?

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:55.296
Yes, of course all
of us know you.

00:20:55.337 --> 00:20:57.923
You are that fiend,
Mister Franklin!

00:20:57.965 --> 00:21:03.053
[FRANKLIN]
Oh, yeah!

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:04.221
It's true!

00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:07.308
The same genius who turned your
king and a bunch of nobodies

00:21:07.349 --> 00:21:10.436
into a buffet for a hoard
of famished monsters!

00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:12.396
So please put
your hands together

00:21:12.438 --> 00:21:16.734
for the Dryfe Imperium Superior,
Giga Professor Franklin!

00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:18.611
A Superior?

00:21:29.705 --> 00:21:32.124
[FRANKLIN] Seems we've got a
lot of hot heads in the crowd

00:21:32.166 --> 00:21:35.878
tonight, Duel City. I'd be
careful if I were you.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:39.840
[FRANKLIN laughs] After all,
you don't want to end up

00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:42.176
in the gaol, do you?

00:21:45.012 --> 00:21:47.556
See my little birdie?

00:21:50.017 --> 00:21:52.520
[MARIE gasps]
Ellie!

00:21:52.561 --> 00:21:56.732
May I present... Elizabeth
Altar, the second princess.

00:21:56.774 --> 00:21:58.651
You starting to catch my drift?

00:21:58.692 --> 00:22:00.861
I do believe
assassinating a royal

00:22:00.903 --> 00:22:03.155
means instant imprisonment.

00:22:03.197 --> 00:22:10.955
[FRANKLIN laughing]

00:22:14.959 --> 00:22:19.755
So, now. Let's play
a game, shall we?

00:23:52.514 --> 00:23:54.350
[RAY]
"The Beginning of Madness."
