WEBVTT

00:00:08.634 --> 00:00:11.470
[PROFESSOR] So, it would
appear our latest attempt

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:14.014
to stomp out powerful
tians has failed.

00:00:14.056 --> 00:00:16.600
[GENERAL] I'd say our strategy
had a few holes.

00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:18.435
[PROFESSOR] The original
plan was for us to give

00:00:18.477 --> 00:00:20.312
the little sister
poisoned remberries

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:22.481
that she would share
with her big sister,

00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:23.732
but for some unknown reason,

00:00:23.774 --> 00:00:26.485
all the remberries had
vanished from stores.

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:28.570
Therefore, we ended up
having to send in

00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:30.572
some Demi‐Drag‐Worms instead.

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:33.158
[GENERAL] The chief issue here
is that our back‐up plan

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.409
was also foiled.

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:36.745
[PROFESSOR]
That bear is far too strong!

00:00:36.787 --> 00:00:39.039
He took on nearly a
hundred Demi‐Drags!

00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:40.958
[GENERAL]
I could handle that much.

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:43.377
But a jobless level‐zero
defeating even

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:45.504
a single Demi‐Drag‐Worm?

00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:48.257
I've never heard of such
a ridiculous feat before.

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:51.134
[PROFESSOR] Dear me, so it's not
the bear that has you on edge,

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:53.303
General. It's the rank beginner?

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:57.015
[GENERAL] Heh. I look forward
to wiping him out.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:59.476
King of Beasts, you've
been quiet all this time.

00:00:59.518 --> 00:01:00.769
Anything to add?

00:01:00.811 --> 00:01:02.980
[KING OF BEASTS]
I thought the bear was cute.

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:05.232
[PROFESSOR laughing]

00:01:05.274 --> 00:01:07.901
[GENERAL] I'll never understand
your taste, King.

00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:41.912
[SHU]
A toast!

00:02:41.953 --> 00:02:45.248
Here's to Ray's arrival and
his first quest cleared!

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.211
Cheers, grizz! Now, please,
eat. Enjoy yourself.

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.089
So good!

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.883
[SHU] The owner here is the
top‐class Star Chef, grizz.

00:02:54.925 --> 00:02:57.678
Like a three‐star chef
in the real world.

00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:00.847
[RAY]
"Hungry"?

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.309
[SHU] You'll get updates
if anything happens IRL.

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:05.894
[RAY]
Oh, okay.

00:03:05.936 --> 00:03:07.604
Let me just logout
for a quick minute.

00:03:07.646 --> 00:03:09.064
What? You can't!

00:03:09.106 --> 00:03:11.775
Please, Master, I won't be able
to eat without you here!

00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:15.070
Come on, you're gonna be
fine. I'll be right back.

00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:23.745
[REIJI] Whoa... It's hard
to believe only a third

00:03:23.787 --> 00:03:26.206
of that time actually
passed, man.

00:03:26.248 --> 00:03:29.376
Well, guess I better
take care of business.

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:35.799
[SHU]
Welcome back, grizz!

00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:40.345
[NEMESIS screams]
I was hungry.

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:42.305
[SHU]
Worry not, grizz.

00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:43.432
[NEMESIS laughing]

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:45.851
[SHU]
Time for round two!

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:48.061
Hey, bro, if I'm
understanding all of this right,

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:50.856
Embryos will change their
shape as they evolve.

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:53.442
So will my Nemesis change
out of this human form?

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:56.194
[SHU] Evolution style
is all up to the Master.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:59.448
However, Nemesis will probably
always be a Maiden.

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.117
The Arms portion might evolve
into a different type,

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.952
but Maiden is already a hybrid,

00:04:03.994 --> 00:04:06.788
it's like a mixture
of multiple types.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.541
Whoa. Seems I might've
hit the jackpot.

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:11.918
Oh, and I'm the jackpot, huh?

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:16.173
[SHU] I know another player
with a Maiden Embryo.

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:19.134
The secondary type changed
in many different ways.

00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:21.720
And now, she's
a Superior Embryo.

00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:23.680
I don't know what that means.

00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:26.057
[SHU] A first to third‐form
Embryo is low‐rank.

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.310
From fourth to sixth
form, it's high.

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:31.521
And when it reaches its seventh
and also ultimate form,

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:34.775
it's considered to be
a Superior Embryo.

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:38.612
This title is given because it's
surpassed the highest rank.

00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:40.989
There's an even higher form.

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:42.616
I wonder if we'll get there.

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:44.201
[SHU]
Fewer than a hundred players

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:47.287
have reached that point, though.

00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:50.207
So. Just how far has
your Embryo evolved?

00:04:50.248 --> 00:04:54.377
[SHU]
That's a secret, grizz. Nom.

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.338
Hey, I've kinda been wondering,

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.882
do you and Liliana have
like a "past" together?

00:04:58.924 --> 00:05:01.593
It totally looked like
she knew you to me.

00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:04.179
[SHU]
Grizz...

00:05:04.221 --> 00:05:06.890
Don't tell me you did something.

00:05:06.932 --> 00:05:09.935
[SHU] She resents me because
I did <i>not</i> do something.

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:12.938
Huh? What does that mean?

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.024
[SHU] Six months back in Dendro
time, Dryfe Imperium,

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:19.694
the land of machines,
waged war on the Altar Kingdom.

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:21.780
The Altar Kingdom lost that war.

00:05:21.822 --> 00:05:24.324
They also lost a third
of their territory.

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:26.284
From their tians,
they lost the Ark Sage

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:29.704
and half their knights,
as well as their king.

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:31.873
So is Dryfe just more powerful?

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:35.252
[SHU] No, the two countries were
evenly matched in might.

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:38.630
It's just that most of Altar's
Masters didn't participate.

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:39.548
[gasps]

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.049
[SHU]
For some unknown reason,

00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:44.052
the king decided not
to give out prizes.

00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:47.848
Meanwhile, the opposing Dryfe
had set clear prize standards.

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.934
That said, the real
nail in Altar's coffin

00:05:50.976 --> 00:05:54.104
was the Big Three
sitting out the war.

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:56.439
King of Destruction,
real name unknown,

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:58.817
at the top of the kill rankings.

00:05:58.859 --> 00:06:02.320
Over Gladiator Figaro,
at the top of the duel rankings.

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:04.239
And High Priestess Tsukiyo Fuso,

00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:06.575
leader of the
Lunar Society clan,

00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:09.035
at the top of the clan rankings.

00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:12.289
Since the top players in each
rank refused to take part,

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.707
most of the other
ranking players

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:15.959
decided not to fight as well.

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:18.461
To make things worse,
only ranked players

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:22.215
and clans were allowed to
participate in the first place.

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:23.884
Oh, I get it.

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:25.927
[SHU]
Dryfe's top three, though...

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:27.971
They were all there
in the fight.

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:30.265
Altar was practically trampled.

00:06:30.307 --> 00:06:33.435
The kingdom was headed
straight for total ruination.

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:36.187
Luckily for Altar,
Dryfe's neighbor, Caldina,

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:40.650
invaded them mid‐war,
so Dryfe withdrew from Altar.

00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:43.695
Right. And that's what made
Liliana resent you because...

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:45.655
[SHU] Because I'm one
of the ranking members

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:49.117
who refused to take
part in the war.

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:51.328
And... the last
Knight commander,

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:54.039
who died in the war,
was her father.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.874
[gasps] Oh, man.

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:57.626
Why'd you choose not to fight?

00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:01.588
[SHU] With me, broken gear
means a blown cover.

00:07:02.881 --> 00:07:06.301
Seriously? You kept your
default real‐world looks?

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:07.844
[SHU]
Whoopsie, grizz.

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:11.640
[sighs] I guess in your case,
yeah, that would be kinda bad.

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:13.433
[SHU]
I've changed my equipment since.

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:15.143
I'll be in the next one.

00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:17.437
So do you think Dryfe
is gonna attack again?

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.521
[SHU]
I do.

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:19.898
They've been beefing
themselves up

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.900
while our side has been
getting weaker.

00:07:21.942 --> 00:07:25.028
It will most certainly be
a very tough fight to bear.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.404
[RAY]
Getting weaker?

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:29.824
[SHU] Lots of players immigrated
to other lands after Altar lost.

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:33.954
Shuffled 70% of
the rankings, too.

00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:35.914
Which means this could be
the perfect chance for me

00:07:35.956 --> 00:07:37.165
to make the rankings.

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:39.626
[NEMESIS] Sounds like you've
found yourself a new goal.

00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:41.753
Yeah! We're gonna have
to get me leveled up

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:44.464
so I can become
a ranking player!

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:46.257
[SHU]
Wonderful. But first of all,

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:49.552
you'll need to get your gear in
order and find yourself a job.

00:07:51.054 --> 00:07:52.597
[SHU]
You okay for weapons, grizz?

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:55.225
Yep. I think Nemesis'll
do as a weapon.

00:07:55.266 --> 00:07:57.894
"Nemesis will do"? No, sir!

00:07:57.936 --> 00:08:00.897
I think you meant to say,
"Nemesis is the best around"!

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:02.649
Nemesis is the best around.

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:05.151
Tch. You should try saying
it like ya mean it.

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:07.487
[SHU]
And now to get a job, grizz.

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:10.865
The Suitable Job
Diagnostics Catalog!

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:12.325
It'll tell you the best jobs

00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:14.911
available for you
right now, grizz!

00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:16.913
Well, that's convenient!

00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:20.834
Let's see what we got here.

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:22.919
Oh! Paladin.

00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:24.421
[SHU]
That's odd.

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:27.799
Usually you can't become a
high‐rank Paladin so early on.

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:29.050
[RAY]
That's high‐rank?

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:29.968
[SHU]
Correct.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:33.888
There are low‐rank and high‐rank
as well as Superior jobs.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.391
Wait, so jobs can be Superior?

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:39.060
[SHU] Yes, but only one person
can hold the Superior rank

00:08:39.102 --> 00:08:42.564
for each job. And the
requirements are pretty strict.

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:44.899
Do you know the
requirements for a Paladin?

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:46.192
[SHU]
You have to defeat at least

00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:49.821
50% of Demi‐Dragon‐class
boss monsters yourself.

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:51.573
Wow, Demi‐Dragon‐class.

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:53.324
You did beat those
gross centipedes.

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:54.159
True!

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.745
[SHU] And donate 200,000
lir to the church.

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:58.872
If I sell my items,
I bet I could get more than

00:08:58.913 --> 00:09:00.206
400,000 thousand lir!

00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:02.167
[SHU] Finally, you must
get a recommendation

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:04.127
from a key Knight
or related figure.

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:07.047
Ah... Okay, well that's
something I don't have yet.

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:09.507
I disagree. If what
you got yesterday

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:11.760
wasn't a recommendation,
I don't know what is.

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:12.802
[SHU]
Ah...

00:09:12.844 --> 00:09:16.139
So it seems that was the main
reward from yesterday's quest!

00:09:16.181 --> 00:09:17.640
Uh.

00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:23.229
[inaudible]

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:42.373
[RAY]
Thanks for everything, big bro.

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:43.208
[SHU]
Sure!

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:44.959
Good luck on your own
from here on out.

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:47.295
Except he's not on
his own cause I'm here.

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:49.964
[SHU] If things get unbearable,
just let me know, grizz.

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:52.217
Okay.

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:54.761
[SHU]
Bearwell!

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:57.097
Oh, this is so exciting!

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:59.516
I can't wait to get you
leveled up, Master!

00:09:59.557 --> 00:10:01.518
[laughs]

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:05.105
On this night, I have an
unquenchable thirst for blood!

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:06.898
Um, it's still light out.

00:10:10.401 --> 00:10:12.028
[RAY yells]

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.655
[GOBLIN A groans]

00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:16.699
All in a day's work!

00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:18.535
I'm practically
invincible right now!

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:19.577
[NEMESIS]
You've gained three levels

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:20.870
and learned some skills, too.

00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:23.540
That recovery magic
is pretty cool, huh?

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:27.877
[GOBLINS grunting, laughing]

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:32.841
[NEMESIS] Aww. Looks like those
two are having a hard time.

00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:34.384
Yeah, sure does.

00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:37.137
It would be a little rude just
to barge in with an assist.

00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:37.971
I know!

00:10:38.012 --> 00:10:40.223
First Heal!

00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:42.433
[BOTH gasp]

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:43.518
[ROOK]
Much appreciated!

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.686
[BABYLON]
Thank you!

00:10:44.727 --> 00:10:45.645
[RAY chuckles]

00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:50.233

[GOBLIN B groans]

00:10:56.614 --> 00:10:58.575
[RAY]
First Heal!

00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:03.496
Hey. Thank you so much
for healing us!

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:04.747
All better!

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:06.541
Sure! My name's Ray Starling.

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:08.543
I actually started
Dendro yesterday.

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:10.003
Hello, Ray. I'm Rook.

00:11:10.044 --> 00:11:12.213
Funny enough, I only joined
up yesterday, as well!

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:14.048
And I'm Babi‐Babylon. Oh!

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.593
And I am an Embryo
Type Guardian!

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:21.848
[NEMESIS] It's not often you see
a Guardian that's a humanoid.

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.475
You might wanna stop
staring, it's kinda rude.

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:27.312
I'm sorry. Couldn't
help it, she's rare.

00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:30.607
Greetings. I just so happen to
be Embryo Type Maiden‐Arms,

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:32.442
the name's Nemesis.

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:37.280
She's a Guardian?
But I thought they were all

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:39.199
supposed to look
more like monsters.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.367
True, but Babi is a succubus!

00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:45.288
She's sexy and super‐duper cute,
and oh‐so drool‐worthy!

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.373
[ROOK]
...it's embarrassing!

00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:48.708
Oh no, Rook!

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.043
Are you ashamed of Babi?

00:11:50.084 --> 00:11:51.794
No, of course I'm not.

00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:54.422
It's just, well, you
flaunting your assets

00:11:54.464 --> 00:11:56.382
is really just telling people
what's in my mind,

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:57.800
and that makes me feel funny.

00:11:57.842 --> 00:11:58.760
[RAY chuckles]

00:11:58.801 --> 00:11:59.636
[NEMESIS]
Huh.

00:11:59.677 --> 00:12:02.680
Anyway, as a thank you
for being so helpful,

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:05.183
how about we go and grab a bite?

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:07.352
I always like the idea
of something sweet!

00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:08.937
We would love to go with you.

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:12.023
Hooray! Babi loves sweets, too!

00:12:12.982 --> 00:12:14.984
[NEMESIS] It's the most
delicious time of year

00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:16.110
for peaches!

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:19.697
Babi can't have sweets without
this to balance the flavor!

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:21.908
With hot sauce? Really?

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:24.494
True to her name, Babylon has
a blasphemous way about her,

00:12:24.535 --> 00:12:25.495
even while eating.

00:12:25.536 --> 00:12:28.831
[laughing] You're right
about that, it's true.

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:30.959
[NEMESIS] Ten more peach
tarts here, please!

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.086
But Nemesis has her
beat on sheer quantity.

00:12:33.127 --> 00:12:33.920
So much food.

00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:37.090
I know. So much food.

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:43.263
Bye! We should totally
form a party one day!

00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:45.598
Yes we should!
Sounds like fun!

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:48.393
You ready?

00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:51.271
Let's do this,
time to level you up!

00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:52.647
[WOLF A whines]

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:57.568
[RAY panting]

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.946
At this rate, I'll be all
the way up to level 13

00:12:59.988 --> 00:13:02.991
by the end of the day. Then,
we can move on to a mor‐‐

00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:04.200
[RAY gasping]

00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:07.120
[RAY]
What just happened?

00:13:07.161 --> 00:13:07.954
[NEMESIS]
Master!

00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:09.914
[RAY grunts, yells]

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:12.208
[NEMESIS]
Counter Absorption!

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.002
[RAY gasps]

00:13:14.043 --> 00:13:16.921
[RAY] A monster?
No, that can't be right.

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:19.966
A monster's name would
show up on my HUD.

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:22.260
[NEMESIS]
Master, this fiend...

00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:26.848
[RAY]
A monster‐shaped Embryo...

00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:27.932
It's a Guardian!

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:30.518
[PLAYERS screaming]

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:34.230
Are those all players screaming?

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:36.566
[RAY]
A PK, a player killer!

00:13:36.607 --> 00:13:38.359
[NEMESIS]
Master, retreat!

00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:41.029
[RAY grunts]
First Heal!

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:45.158
I don't understand why
there are more victims,

00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:47.327
the Guardian's dead,
so who's attacking them?

00:13:47.368 --> 00:13:49.579
[NEMESIS] It must be a
Guardian's high‐rank offshoot,

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:50.538
Type Legion.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.541
It can swarm, but individual
units perform poorly.

00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:57.211
[RAY] That's performing poorly?
Impressive.

00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:58.087
[NEMESIS]
Master!

00:13:58.129 --> 00:13:59.505
No!

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:02.175
[GUARDIAN A roars]

00:14:02.216 --> 00:14:04.427
I guess that wasn't too bad.

00:14:17.315 --> 00:14:18.649
Crap. It's him.

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:20.860
[NEMESIS]
Run, Master!

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:39.796
[gasps]

00:14:47.011 --> 00:14:48.596
[REIJI]
Damn it!

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:03.111
[NEMESIS]
Master, you're back.

00:15:03.152 --> 00:15:04.612
[gasps]

00:15:07.532 --> 00:15:09.283
Hello again.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.959
‐‐I'm sorry.
‐‐[NEMESIS] Stop.

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:20.545
I'm the one who
should apologize.

00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:22.713
If I'd been stronger,
I wouldn't have lost against

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:25.341
another Embryo, but I
wasn't, and I failed you.

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:27.552
Please, don't say that‐‐
it's not true.

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:30.096
You shielding me is the only
reason I made it that far!

00:15:30.138 --> 00:15:34.392
You're wrong! It doesn't matter.
I should have been stronger!

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:37.103
That was terrifying.
If you hadn't been a player,

00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:41.190
then you would... you would
have been lost forever.

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:44.861
And that scares me.
It scares me to death.

00:15:48.906 --> 00:15:50.741
[NEMESIS cries]

00:15:52.034 --> 00:15:56.122
[RAY] Nemesis. I understand
where you're coming from.

00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:57.874
But listen.

00:15:57.915 --> 00:16:00.668
The truth is, both of us
were in way over our heads.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:01.919
Master...

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:06.340
But here we are, alive,
and we get to try again.

00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:11.137
We'll grow stronger together,
and then we'll have our revenge!

00:16:11.179 --> 00:16:13.806
Goodness, you really are
clingy, you know that?

00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:16.809
Honestly. It's a bit much.

00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:18.436
But you're absolutely right.

00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:20.730
And there's still a
path for us to follow!

00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:22.815
Whoever that Master
is will definitely pay

00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:24.108
for what they've done to us!

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.860
That's right! They'll pay!

00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:27.361
You ready, Master?

00:16:27.403 --> 00:16:29.489
Come on, let's get super strong!

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:32.742
Then, no matter what happens, no
one will be able to separate us!

00:16:32.783 --> 00:16:35.828
All right! I believe
in us, Nemesis!

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:39.999
This moment right now, this is
the moment we really begin!

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:43.419
I know I said we
should get stronger,

00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:45.880
but why does it have to be here?

00:16:45.922 --> 00:16:47.673
A bunch of player killers
have shown up near

00:16:47.715 --> 00:16:49.675
the royal capital all at once.

00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:51.135
The only place they
haven't appeared is

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:54.388
at the Tomb Labyrinth
inside the royal cemetery.

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:55.681
[NEMESIS]
But from what I can tell,

00:16:55.723 --> 00:16:58.142
there aren't any other
players here, either.

00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:00.102
Yeah, well, that's most
likely because players

00:17:00.144 --> 00:17:03.689
first have to obtain 100,000
lir permit to gain entrance.

00:17:07.276 --> 00:17:08.152
[RAY]
Uhh...

00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:09.946
[GATEKEEPER A]
You may enter.

00:17:11.572 --> 00:17:13.574
[RAY]
Don't you wanna see my permit?

00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:16.911
No, Paladins aren't
required to have a permit.

00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:21.290
[RAY]
Ah! That cost 100,000 lir!

00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:23.918
I'm not gonna worry about
all that money for now.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.296
Shall we? Nemesis, could you
transform into a sword‐‐

00:17:27.338 --> 00:17:28.381
[NEMESIS] I'm not scared.
I'm not scared.

00:17:28.422 --> 00:17:30.883
I'm not scared. I'm not scared.
I'm not scared. I'm not scared.

00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:31.801
I'm not scared...

00:17:31.842 --> 00:17:35.054
Yeah, so, by any chance,
are you scared of ghosts?

00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:36.973
[NEMESIS screams]

00:17:37.014 --> 00:17:39.433
[NEMESIS] Namu Amida,
abracadabra. Elohim, Essaim

00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:41.310
dear Cthulhu please take me now!

00:17:41.352 --> 00:17:43.437
Cthulhu, pardon her sacrilege.

00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:49.777
[RAY] Hey. Go figure, it's
actually pretty nice in here.

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:51.946
[NEMESIS]
You're right. This I can handle.

00:17:51.988 --> 00:17:54.156
Okay, monsters,
say your prayers‐‐

[MONSTERS moaning]

00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:58.953
[NEMESIS]
I don't like this at all!

00:17:58.995 --> 00:18:01.581
[RAY] Whoa! Will you try
to calm down, please!

00:18:01.622 --> 00:18:02.999
[NEMESIS]
You're planning on using me to

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.166
slice them up, aren't you?

00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:06.919
Obviously, that's
what I plan on doing!

00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:09.922
Ready? Let's go get em!

00:18:09.964 --> 00:18:10.756
[NEMESIS screaming]

00:18:10.798 --> 00:18:12.842
[MONSTERS groaning]

00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:13.926
[NEMESIS whines]

00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:18.472
[NEMESIS whimpers] That rotten
flesh. And those maggots...

00:18:18.514 --> 00:18:20.975
Okay, you can stop crying now.

00:18:21.017 --> 00:18:23.144
Cheer up, that fight
got me to level seven!

00:18:23.185 --> 00:18:25.021
[NEMESIS whines]

00:18:25.062 --> 00:18:28.274
[sighs] I'll give you a
nice thorough polishing

00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:30.484
when we get back.

00:18:30.526 --> 00:18:32.111
[NEMESIS]
You promise?

00:18:36.699 --> 00:18:38.993
Looks like this is all
for the first floor.

00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:41.746
[NEMESIS] Master,
someone's coming upstairs.

00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:46.459
[RAY gasps]

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.336
[RAY, NEMESIS]
Counter Absorption!

00:18:59.013 --> 00:19:02.808
[NEMESIS] What will it be,
Master... Fight? Or run?

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:05.436
[RAY] I can use Counter
Absorption one more time.

00:19:05.478 --> 00:19:08.606
But if they block that,
I'm all out of options.

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:12.234
If I run, they'll just go for
my back, and I'll die anyway.

00:19:12.276 --> 00:19:13.861
Can't do that.

00:19:13.903 --> 00:19:15.613
[NEMESIS]
Understood, Master.

00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:17.615
[RAY]
I'm betting it all on one thing:

00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:19.784
I'll block their attack after
they show themselves

00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:23.120
and then I'll deal twice the
damage of their second blow!

00:19:45.768 --> 00:19:46.811
[FIGARO]
I'm so sorry!

00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:50.314
Uh? Who are you?

00:19:51.607 --> 00:19:55.695
[RAY] So, you mean you were
thinking that I was the monster?

00:19:55.736 --> 00:19:57.613
I truly am sorry.

00:19:57.655 --> 00:20:00.825
[RAY laughs]
Well, I suppose from that angle

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:03.703
and with the back light,
I might look a little monstery.

00:20:03.744 --> 00:20:04.620
You think?

00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:06.497
[FIGARO] What are you
doing on an upper floor

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:08.499
all by yourself, anyway?

00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:11.794
Me? Just your basic grinding.

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:14.171
It would be quite a bit
safer to fight outdoors

00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:15.965
if you're still at a low level.

00:20:16.006 --> 00:20:17.425
Oh, you didn't know?

00:20:17.466 --> 00:20:19.802
There are player killers
all over the royal capital.

00:20:19.844 --> 00:20:21.095
It's unusable.

00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:22.805
I had no idea there
were player killers,

00:20:22.847 --> 00:20:24.181
but I've been in here
for five days.

00:20:24.223 --> 00:20:25.474
Five days?

00:20:25.516 --> 00:20:27.935
Why have you been hanging
out in here for so long?

00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:30.730
I wanted to go down as far
as I could all on my own.

00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:33.190
I did fairly well. I set
a new record this time.

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:35.109
How far down did
you manage to go?

00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:36.485
[FIGARO]
To floor 48.

00:20:36.527 --> 00:20:38.070
[BOTH]
By yourself?!

00:20:38.112 --> 00:20:39.697
And just who might you be?

00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:43.284
Oh! I haven't introduced
myself, have I?

00:20:43.325 --> 00:20:46.078
The name's Figaro.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.165
‐‐[RAY] Hi! My name's Ray.
‐‐[FIGARO] Pleasure.

00:20:49.206 --> 00:20:51.208
This is my Embryo, Nemesis.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.918
Uh. Wait a minute.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.212
You're like, top‐ranking Figaro?

00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:57.089
Yep. That's the one.

00:20:57.131 --> 00:21:00.092
Why would someone like you
be in a place like this?

00:21:00.134 --> 00:21:03.471
I like labyrinths.
I'm a big fan of arenas, too.

00:21:03.512 --> 00:21:04.722
Arenas?

00:21:04.764 --> 00:21:07.183
[FIGARO] The kingdom has some
in Gideon, the Duel City.

00:21:07.224 --> 00:21:09.977
You can die in an arena
without actually dying.

00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:12.271
You should come by
and try it sometime!

00:21:12.313 --> 00:21:13.898
Okay?

00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:16.150
Gideon's located right over
the southern mountains,

00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:17.818
so it's not terribly far.

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:21.155
Oh, all the maps are
probably locked right now

00:21:21.197 --> 00:21:24.533
If passage to and from
Gideon has been cut off...

00:21:24.575 --> 00:21:26.619
What a bother.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.497
You know, I owe you for earlier,
so please don't worry.

00:21:29.538 --> 00:21:31.081
I'll take care of this.

00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:34.210
The outside should be
usable by tomorrow.

00:21:34.251 --> 00:21:37.004
Then, you can get those levels
up and head on over to Gideon.

00:21:37.046 --> 00:21:38.380
Yeah. Sure!

00:21:38.422 --> 00:21:40.758
I can tell the two of
you are really good.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.634
Huh?

00:21:41.675 --> 00:21:44.220
You took my blow without
getting destroyed, right?

00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:45.721
I like you!

00:21:45.763 --> 00:21:48.599
And I wouldn't mind an arena
bout with you before too long.

00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:50.017
That sounds great!

00:21:50.059 --> 00:21:53.062
It's a deal, then.

00:21:53.103 --> 00:21:56.565
Yes! It's time for us to
go level up like crazy!

00:21:56.607 --> 00:21:58.484
Let's get grinding!

00:21:59.527 --> 00:22:03.864
[NEMESIS cries]

00:22:03.906 --> 00:22:06.200
[NEMESIS] I can feel more
of their grody flesh

00:22:06.242 --> 00:22:08.786
stuck on me down
there, and I hate it.

00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:12.289
Okay, then. I'll get it.

00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:13.874
[NEMESIS] Oh, there's more
flesh, right there...

00:22:13.916 --> 00:22:16.168
[RAY]
Yep. I got it.

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:17.920
[NEMESIS]
And more there, too!

00:22:17.962 --> 00:22:19.839
[NEMESIS whines]

00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:54.016
[RAY]
"Superior."
