WEBVTT

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.433
[FRANKLIN]
Enough of this farce.

00:00:16.475 --> 00:00:20.979
I know how this is going to end,
and it's not with me winning.

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.314
Very well.

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:26.735
I'll just delete their victory,
and by extension, my defeat.

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:35.077

[SHU grunts]

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:49.716
[SPECTATOR D] You got this,
King of Destruction!

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:51.677
[SPECTATOR A] We believe in you,
Masters! Come on!

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.136
[SPECTATOR B]
Fight for us!

00:00:54.972 --> 00:00:59.685
Magic Power Magnification.
Range Extension.

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:04.731
Magnify Designated Area.
Magic Conceal.

00:01:04.773 --> 00:01:07.985
Now to use some MP
for each of the skills.

00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:12.072
Something generous.
Say 50,000 apiece.

00:01:13.657 --> 00:01:15.576
Summon Mud Clap.

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:23.959
[GIANT WORM A screeches]

00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:38.348
A bit of overkill.
I could've used a third.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.601
[SPECTATOR C]
You okay there, buddy?

00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:43.103
I noticed your head's
been hangin' kinda low.

00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:44.938
Oh. That.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.483
An annoying insect caught
my eye, but it's gone now.

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:52.070
[FRANKLIN]
It won't be much longer.

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:57.034
There were just far too many
unexpected factors. I mean...

00:01:57.075 --> 00:02:00.662
Is the King of Destruction
even playing fair?

00:02:00.704 --> 00:02:02.289
[SHU]
You want some?

00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:13.508
Heh. Damn. Judging by the
number of shells fired off,

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.594
he must've spent at
least three billion lir

00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:17.846
on this little fireworks show.

00:02:17.888 --> 00:02:20.557
Not to say my monsters
were cheap, either.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.185
At the very least, we're
both feelin' the pinch.

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.067
[FRANKLIN]
Pandemonium's within range,

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:32.194
so why isn't he firing on it?

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:34.196
He could have easily
shot down my embryo

00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:39.201
before it spat out all 50,000
of my kamikaze troops.

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:40.911
[SHU yells]

00:02:41.912 --> 00:02:43.914
[FRANKLIN]
It doesn't make any sense,

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:46.166
unless he's stalling for time.

00:02:46.208 --> 00:02:47.334
[gasps]

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:53.632
[FRANKLIN] You just can't stand
not being front and center.

00:02:53.674 --> 00:02:56.051
Can you, Ray?

00:02:56.093 --> 00:02:59.471
You got it all wrong, we just
have unfinished business.

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:12.567
[CREATURES screeching]

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.278
[SHU grunts]

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:21.326
[ROOK] Unbelievable.
Shu's got an amazing Embryo.

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:25.247
[ROOK]
Hugo?

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:29.793
I won't stop you.

00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:33.338
Better than being stuck here,
worrying about them.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.006
[SHU grunting]

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:37.718
[BALDR] Ray Starling has reached
the observation platform

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.344
atop Pandemonium.

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:40.971
Is that right?

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:43.515
[RAY] There's a question
I have to ask Franklin,

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:46.518
and something I need
to take care of.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.895
But I'm going to need
some help reaching him.

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:51.398
Will you give me a hand?

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.776
[SHU] Do what you think is
necessary. I have your back.

00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:56.361
I'll handle things down here,

00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:58.655
no matter how out
of control they get.

00:03:58.697 --> 00:04:02.534
After all, that's what
big brothers are for.

00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:03.702
[FRANKLIN] There's something
I've been meaning

00:04:03.744 --> 00:04:07.164
to inquire about, Ray Starling.

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:10.041
Any relation to a Master
named Shu Starling?

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.002
My older brother.

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:14.671
So. The older sibling's
a Superior

00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:18.508
while the younger one
is a Maiden‐wielder.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.679
Surprisingly, it's not
that uncommon of a tale.

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:23.680
You have the floor.

00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:25.891
Let's hear why you bothered
coming all this way,

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:28.185
riding your brother's
coattails, no less.

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:29.770
[RAY]
There are three reasons.

00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:31.646
My, my, so many?

00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:35.192
Though, I can make an educated
guess what one of them is.

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:37.527
You're here to rescue
the princess, right?

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:39.780
That's why your brother
is playing it safe.

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:43.200
He can't afford to destroy
Pandemonium just yet.

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:44.951
Now, the second one?

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:47.162
There was something
I needed to ask you.

00:04:47.204 --> 00:04:49.831
[FRANKLIN] A question for me?
Let's hear it then.

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:54.419
No games, just what exactly
do the tians mean to you?

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:57.172
You can't seem to let
the issue go, can you?

00:04:57.214 --> 00:04:59.674
Is Infinite Dendrogram
merely a game

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:02.844
or something much
much more? Please.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.057
Why must we do this?

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:14.314
[laughing]

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:19.986
Anyone who's convinced
this is a game is an idiot,

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:23.073
or a child who accepts
authority without question.

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:24.991
How could this all be fake?

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:28.829
Look around! The realism!
The models! The life!

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.831
Ignore anything
system‐related for a sec.

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:33.625
This world is beyond
any level of VR.

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:36.044
Let's be honest,
if it wasn't for that system

00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:37.963
constantly insisting
what you were seeing

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:40.715
was only a game,
you'd think otherwise.

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:43.301
Even I'm in the dark
about its true purpose.

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.679
Although, there
are some theories.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.015
For example, one could conclude
there's a plan to implement

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:51.560
virtual reality on a global
scale and it's currently

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:53.937
in the human
experimentation phase.

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:57.274
But this seems unlikely given
how advanced the technology is.

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:59.734
It's beyond anything
we've ever seen.

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:02.487
There're people who are
convinced Dendrogram is real,

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:05.115
a world that actually exists.

00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:07.701
For all I know,
Extra‐terrestrials

00:06:07.742 --> 00:06:09.911
are somehow involved.

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:11.913
And? What does that
make the people

00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:13.915
who're living in this world?

00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:16.042
[FRANKLIN] Artificial
intelligence with sophisticated

00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:18.253
minds, indistinguishable
from humans.

00:06:18.295 --> 00:06:20.547
Or real live people
from another world.

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:22.883
Maybe life that conforms
to those boundaries.

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:24.175
At the very least,

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:27.220
they're more than a collection
of alternating bits.

00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:29.431
But let me make this clear.

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:32.225
Even if this was Earth,
nothing would be different.

00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:34.936
I'd still proceed.
Assuming the situations,

00:06:34.978 --> 00:06:36.980
conditions and my
powers were the same.

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:40.901
I would act the exact same
way I'm acting right now.

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:43.987
No matter how
many thousands died.

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:47.824
That is what you really wanted
to know, isn't it, Ray?

00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:49.451
Thought so.

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:51.620
I mean, a Maiden's Master
like you couldn't help

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:55.874
but wonder why I would
orchestrate such a vile plot.

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:01.922
Exactly! How could you
do such a thing?

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:09.012
Because I'm done losing.

00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:12.349
I've had quite enough
of being manipulated.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.976
I'll crush anyone who
stands in my way,

00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:18.772
who tries to interfere with
how I choose to live my life!

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:20.273
Is that so?

00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:22.692
[FRANKLIN] Well, that ought
to cover your second reason.

00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:25.278
What's your third? Out with it.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.155
‐‐It's because...

[FRANKLIN gasping]

00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:34.245
Looks like your brother
grew tired of waiting.

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:38.124
Must've forgotten I had
the princess up here. Huh?

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:40.543
[FRANKLIN]
It wasn't Ray.

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:42.754
I've been watching him
the entire time.

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:43.880
[FRANKLIN grunts]

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:46.049
[FRANKLIN]
The Superior Killer.

00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:50.387
So that's the way it is.
You were nothing but a decoy.

00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:03.900
[grunts] Now this is
what I call intense!

00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:06.778
They've already
taken care of it.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.406
I had a feeling
this might happen.

00:08:09.447 --> 00:08:10.991
The King of Destruction
showed up

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:13.952
instead of either of the
Superiors from the Clash.

00:08:13.994 --> 00:08:16.621
Should've accounted for that.

00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:19.666
Normally, the Worm would
be impossible to counter,

00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:23.086
but I didn't plan on
Xunyu's ultimate skill.

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:25.380
Not only did I lose
my chance of winning,

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:27.340
I've lost any hope of surviving.

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:29.134
[RAY yells]

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:31.302
[FRANKLIN]
Too late for that.

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:34.180
The cannon fire
has done its damage.

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:36.391
They probably planned
this in advance.

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:38.643
They are brothers after all.

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:42.022
But even if they didn't,
it's impressive nonetheless.

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:45.859
Each knew what
the other would do.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.527
Now I'm jealous.

00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:49.863
I'm assuming that the third
reason you showed up

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:52.073
was to defeat me.

00:08:52.115 --> 00:08:57.037
[FRANKLIN] I've lost, and I
accept that fact. But one day...

00:08:58.997 --> 00:08:59.789
[RAY gasps]

Step aside, Hugo!

[NEMESIS] You need to build up
your damage counter

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:18.767
or we won't break
through that armor!

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:23.063
I hear you. Are you ready
to get reckless?

00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:27.692
[NEMESIS] Reckless? Sure.
Leave it to me, Master!

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:31.154
That's my sister!
And I'll protect her!

This is your last stand, Ray!

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:39.579
All right. Bring it!

I'll trade an arm for an arm!

Now onto the third reason.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:30.713
I'll take care of
that right away!

00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:32.966
Franklin!

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:47.689
[FRANKLIN] Well, it's your win.
Celebrate while you can.

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:04.831
So this is what it feels
like to be you, Master.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.479
[RAY grunting]

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:31.774
I was able to reattach your
right arm, but my recovery magic

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:34.110
doesn't allow me to
restore missing limbs.

00:11:34.152 --> 00:11:36.196
Wow, this is way better
than I could've hoped for,

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:37.989
so I owe you big time.

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:39.532
To the best of my knowledge,

00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:42.202
the only person in the kingdom
who'd be capable of healing

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:46.247
a wound that severe is High
Priestess Tsukuyo Fuso.

00:11:46.289 --> 00:11:47.999
Though, I can't in
good conscience

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:49.876
recommend her for the job.

00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:55.590
[RAY]
Mmm...

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:57.592
Think I'll pass.

00:11:57.634 --> 00:12:00.345
I should be good for now,
as long as I have my right arm.

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:04.057
Plus, I also found out I can
hold my sword with my mouth.

00:12:04.098 --> 00:12:07.143
I can make this work.

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:11.147
Then does that technically mean
you and I have kissed?

00:12:11.189 --> 00:12:14.359
[MARIE] And so Franklin's game
came to an end,

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.528
with the Kingdom of Altar
claiming victory.

00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:22.617
‐‐[FIGARO, XUNYU] Cheers!
‐‐[SHU] Cheers, grizz!

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:30.124
[SHU] That hit the spot. But I'm
gonna need a few more of these

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:32.752
to bear with my exhaustion.

00:12:32.794 --> 00:12:34.212
Nice work tonight.

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:37.507
Drinks are on me, by the way,
so order as much as you want.

00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:39.008
Same goes for you.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.719
Thanks, but seeing
how I'm underage,

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:43.596
I'll be good sticking
with some juice.

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:47.100
[SHU] So who ended up making
the first move at the arena?

00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:48.559
That big worm tried to,

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:51.396
but I smashed the core before it
even got close to us.

00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:53.064
Strangely, the King of Beasts

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:56.276
is the strongest physically,
but didn't budge.

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:58.486
Though Caldina's Magically
Strongest, The Earth,

00:12:58.528 --> 00:13:00.863
apparently couldn't
help himself.

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:02.407
[SHU]
"Apparently"?

00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:04.450
The monster I killed
wasn't moving.

00:13:04.492 --> 00:13:07.704
It made me a little bit curious,
so afterwards,

00:13:07.745 --> 00:13:11.040
I used one of my skills to check
the dirt around the area

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:12.834
and found this.

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:17.714
[SHU grunting]
Dirt with a Binding spell,

00:13:17.755 --> 00:13:20.550
and Multi‐Activated based
on the toughness.

00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:22.802
Good luck reaching the surface
when it's surrounding you

00:13:22.844 --> 00:13:24.887
on all sides.

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:28.182
[FIGARO] What was the purpose of
their visit in the first place?

00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:30.018
[SHU]
This is just a guess, but...

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:32.687
I'm almost certain the
King of Beasts had a goal

00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:35.690
entirely unrelated
to Franklin's plot.

00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:37.525
While The Earth came here
because he knew

00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:41.237
Franklin was about
to terrorize Gideon.

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:43.614
[XUNYU]
And not the other way around?

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:45.241
[SHU]
It's certainly paw‐ssible.

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:47.493
But the King of Beasts
is widely considered to be

00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:50.246
the mightiest warrior
throughout the three nations.

00:13:50.288 --> 00:13:52.749
If she was collaborating
on Franklin's terror plot,

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.043
the plan would have been
designed around her.

00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:57.628
Not only that,
when Franklin needed her most,

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.422
she never once raised a finger.

00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:00.423
[FIGARO]
That's true.

00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:01.591
[SHU]
On the other hand,

00:14:01.632 --> 00:14:04.469
there's The Earth,
or Fatoum if you prefer.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.472
He interfered with one stage
of Franklin's plans,

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:10.558
making it safe to assume that's
the reason he came here.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.101
[XUNYU]
So, the Physically Strongest

00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:14.854
and the Magically Strongest
both in one place.

00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:17.357
It's too bad I didn't get
a chance to take them on

00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:20.485
to find out if they really
deserve their titles.

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:23.988
If memory serves. Shu's fought
The Earth once before.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.491
Sure. I remember hearing
about the battle,

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:28.659
but never which of you won.

00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:31.162
[SHU]
It was... a draw...?

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:32.497
[XUNYU]
What's with the head‐tilt?

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:34.540
[SHU] During the fight,
we ended up destroying

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:38.336
a generated dungeon. So Humpty
and the environment control AI

00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:41.089
ended up having to call it off.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:44.300
That's how you're
gonna leave it?

00:14:44.342 --> 00:14:45.968
[SHU]
If he came all this way,

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:48.554
he could've at
least said "hello."

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:57.480
Such a robust flavor!

00:14:57.522 --> 00:15:01.818
Someday I'll have to get
the boss to make one.

00:15:01.859 --> 00:15:03.236
[FATOUM]
My business within the kingdom

00:15:03.277 --> 00:15:07.573
took longer than expected.
But there was no helping it.

00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:10.660
The original goal
required hardly any time,

00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:13.246
but then the King of Toys
suggested I arrange

00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:15.748
a blockade around
the royal capital.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.543
And afterwards, I heard about
the Empire's terror plot

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:21.504
and wound up visiting Gideon
to put a stop to that.

00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:25.716
Shu! I completely forgot!
We should have met up.

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:29.011
Although, it may have
been for the best.

00:15:29.053 --> 00:15:31.347
I only would have
wanted to fight him.

00:15:37.061 --> 00:15:40.273
[FRANKLIN]
I'm having you leave the clan.

00:15:40.314 --> 00:15:42.275
I'm fired?

00:15:42.316 --> 00:15:44.318
[FRANKLIN]
You're not the only one.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.696
Veldorbell will also be leaving.

00:15:46.737 --> 00:15:49.449
Then again, he only
joined in the first place

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:54.036
to find a 'true hero'...
or something like that.

00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:57.874
But taking part in my plan
had drawbacks for him.

00:15:57.915 --> 00:16:00.877
He ended up
missing out on a lot.

00:16:00.918 --> 00:16:03.963
Still, it's not
entirely unexpected.

00:16:04.005 --> 00:16:07.091
I'm not as popular
as I once was.

00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:09.177
Even before the war,
AR‐I‐CA, the Ace

00:16:09.218 --> 00:16:12.889
stepped away from
the Triangle of Wisdom.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:16.642
Went on to become a Superior in
Caldina, from what I understand.

00:16:16.684 --> 00:16:18.019
Feels like a pattern.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:22.565
Seems these days,
everyone's abandoning me.

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:26.819
So, what compelled you
to try and rescue me?

00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:29.822
Some misguided
sense of affection?

00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:31.407
No, that's not it.

00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:35.203
[FRANKLIN] I betrayed you.
Surely that must have hurt.

00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:36.746
Regardless.

00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:40.625
Then tell me before you go.
Why'd you do it?

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:44.420
Why did you come help me
atop Pandemonium?

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:52.553
I can't tell you the answer.
That's because I'm not sure.

00:16:52.595 --> 00:16:54.222
I don't know.

00:16:59.727 --> 00:17:01.479
[FRANKLIN] If you've thought
about it and couldn't find

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:05.441
an answer, maybe you
acted without thinking,

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:07.985
and that's all there is to it.

00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:10.238
The next time,
you should take a moment

00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:12.865
to form your own conclusion.

00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:16.285
A conclusion you can live
with till the bitter end.

00:17:19.163 --> 00:17:23.000
Go. Broaden your horizons, Yu.

00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:25.211
Travel the world
just like I did.

00:17:25.253 --> 00:17:26.087
[HUGO]
Huh?

00:17:26.128 --> 00:17:28.756
This world and the
experiences you had,

00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:32.718
they're yours and can help
you understand your nature.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.513
You have a lot to gain
by leaving my side.

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:38.224
Going places and
gaining experiences.

00:17:38.266 --> 00:17:43.020
So please go. Explore <i>Infinite</i>
<i>Dendrogram</i> for yourself.

00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:48.651
And afterwards, if you wish to
return, I'll be here for you.

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:50.027
You will?

00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:52.196
[FRANKLIN]
Heh. Oh, right.

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:55.408
A parting gift slash
early birthday present.

00:17:55.449 --> 00:18:01.038
If I recall correctly, you're
turning 15 this coming Tuesday.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.083
I can't believe
you remembered.

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:07.211
You idiot. Do you actually think
I would have forgotten

00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:10.381
my little sister's birthday?

00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:14.969
Francesca, I don't...

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:16.637
Thank you, Sis.

00:18:16.679 --> 00:18:21.517
Please. Let's meet
again, someday.

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:26.314
Yes. Let's. Goodbye, for now.

Uh‐huh...

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:37.658
Hugo. You're looking
emotional. Good talk?

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:38.743
Yeah.

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:42.747
Well, I'm relieved. You two
needed to have a sit down.

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:44.081
You're right, we sure did.

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:47.627
[CYCO] I realize you're girls
on the inside and all.

00:18:47.668 --> 00:18:51.672
But the two of you have the
appearance of young men.

00:18:51.714 --> 00:18:53.841
And watching you both
crying and speaking

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:57.970
in such a feminine manner was,
how should I put this?

00:18:58.012 --> 00:18:59.847
A little off putting.

00:19:05.144 --> 00:19:08.189
[FRANKLIN] And with that,
she's out of the picture.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:11.317
The little sister I...
ought to love.

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:13.986
The person capable of
seeing my softer side.

00:19:14.028 --> 00:19:15.988
The brakes on my conscience.

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:17.740
As long as she was around,

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:20.242
I couldn't pull off
anything truly heinous.

00:19:20.284 --> 00:19:22.787
Now, the chains
have been removed,

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:25.873
and I'll destroy the ones
who've defeated me.

00:19:26.916 --> 00:19:29.251
[FRANKLIN] If you think you've
seen me at my most vengeful,

00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:32.213
Ray Starling, just you wait.

[bell tolls]

00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:37.843
[LILIANA]
Her Highness is safe

00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:40.096
and there were no
civilian casualties.

00:19:40.137 --> 00:19:43.015
On top of that, the Masters
were able to avenge the death

00:19:43.057 --> 00:19:46.143
of every fallen
Knight and Guard.

00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:48.646
I realize they're mightier
than us tians.

Even so, the Masters,
those chosen by Embryos,

00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:55.277
they aren't special.

It's her Highness Elizabeth.

Quickly! Tell me everything
that happened!

Based on the note

it appears she
slipped out again.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.255
What?

00:20:20.928 --> 00:20:22.847
Fighting on top of Silver
might be tough.

00:20:22.888 --> 00:20:24.598
I'm not sure I'll be able
to hold the reins

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.392
and you with only one hand.

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:27.393
Well, you can't.

00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:29.562
But in this instance,
I think it's for the best.

00:20:29.603 --> 00:20:31.230
What makes you say that?

00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:33.149
This is supposed to be
a rematch, right?

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.192
Then we should take
her on like last time.

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:38.696
No steeds, no help,
just the two of us.

00:20:41.407 --> 00:20:45.077
[MARIE] Listen to you,
all fired up and rarin' to go.

00:20:45.119 --> 00:20:48.205
Come on! You can do it, Marie!

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:49.707
Great seeing you again,
Your Highness,

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:52.418
but what brings you out today?
If I may ask?

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.420
Sure I guess I'll permit it.

00:20:54.462 --> 00:20:57.173
I stopped by to cheer you on
and say thank you!

00:20:57.214 --> 00:20:59.133
I might've actually
missed the whole show

00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:01.302
if I hadn't seen your brother
walking by outside

00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:03.888
and followed him in here.

00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:05.556
[SHU]
Grizz grizz!

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:08.434
You did ask for permission
to leave, didn't you?

00:21:08.476 --> 00:21:10.770
Yeah right! I snuck out!

00:21:10.853 --> 00:21:13.439
[RAY growls]
Come on, Liliana!

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:15.524
You'd think security around
here would be tighter!

00:21:15.566 --> 00:21:17.401
With everything that
just happened!

00:21:17.443 --> 00:21:19.069
I felt the same way at first,

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:20.696
but then a thought
occurred to me.

00:21:20.738 --> 00:21:22.448
Sure, she's always
losing her guards,

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:25.534
but maybe it's 'cause she's
a natural escape artist.

00:21:25.576 --> 00:21:28.370
Perhaps you should
consider a career change.

00:21:28.412 --> 00:21:30.664
How's "cat burglar" sound?

00:21:30.706 --> 00:21:33.125
Who says I haven't?

00:21:33.167 --> 00:21:36.545
[sighs] The princess's future
life of crime aside...

00:21:36.587 --> 00:21:38.506
Marie, let's get started.

00:21:38.547 --> 00:21:42.092
[chuckles] While I do admire
your spirit, be real.

00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:44.261
You think you can
win against me?

00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:46.597
We'll find out.
There's no getting past

00:21:46.639 --> 00:21:50.017
the fact my level and stats
are still miles behind yours.

00:21:50.059 --> 00:21:53.437
Our skillsets, well,
they don't even compare.

00:21:53.479 --> 00:21:57.566
And almost forgot, I also lost
my left arm and a bracer, so...

00:21:57.608 --> 00:21:59.985
My odds of winning are slim,

00:22:00.027 --> 00:22:02.363
but that doesn't
mean they're zero.

00:22:02.404 --> 00:22:03.864
There's a chance.

00:22:03.906 --> 00:22:06.659
And as long as
a possibility exists,

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:10.329
I won't stop trying
to reach for it.

00:22:10.371 --> 00:22:13.082
Because that's what seizing
onto hope is all about!

00:22:13.123 --> 00:22:16.919
[SHU laughs] You really get it,
don't you, grizz?

00:22:16.961 --> 00:22:19.547
I'm going into this fight
ready to win it!

00:22:19.588 --> 00:22:22.800
Well, guess that's why they
call you Ray the Unbreakable.

00:22:22.842 --> 00:22:24.802
Is that a nickname?

00:22:24.844 --> 00:22:27.555
Yeah. I figured you
would've heard by now.

00:22:27.596 --> 00:22:30.057
After your exploits,
of course you'd earn one.

00:22:30.099 --> 00:22:32.768
There's also "the King of
Destruction's little brother."

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:36.355
And "The New Master that refused
to let a Superior break them."

00:22:36.397 --> 00:22:37.982
Those are elaborate.

00:22:38.023 --> 00:22:40.109
[MARIE] Then just wait
till you hear these.

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:43.195
So, you've got "Dark Paladin."
"Prince on the Silver Steed."

00:22:43.237 --> 00:22:45.573
And "The Hero Clad
in Violet and Crimson,

00:22:45.614 --> 00:22:48.492
Wielder of Light and Dark,"
which just rolls off the tongue.

00:22:48.534 --> 00:22:49.869
So, what's your preference?

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:51.745
[RAY]
Just "Unbreakable"!

00:22:51.787 --> 00:22:54.164
Don't let me influence you,
but that "Prince" one,

00:22:54.206 --> 00:22:57.251
it's pretty catchy. [laughs]

00:22:57.293 --> 00:22:59.044
Yeah, no thanks.

00:22:59.086 --> 00:23:00.296
Very well, then.

00:23:00.337 --> 00:23:04.091
Unbreakable. You and I have
some unfinished business!

00:23:04.133 --> 00:23:04.967
Nemesis!

00:23:05.009 --> 00:23:06.385
Ready!

00:23:10.264 --> 00:23:13.976
Superior Killer.
You got yourself a fight!

00:23:19.815 --> 00:23:22.568
[RAY, NEMESIS]
Time for the quest to begin!

00:23:26.947 --> 00:23:29.533
[RAY] Well, better finish up
the admissions process

00:23:29.575 --> 00:23:31.118
for university.

00:23:36.373 --> 00:23:38.959
Hey, how are you doing?

00:23:46.467 --> 00:23:48.052
[RAY grunts]
