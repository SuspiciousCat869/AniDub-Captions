00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:31.274
Make sure Ray Starling
passes through.

00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:32.650
Why him?

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:36.988
Because I'm going to smash
the twerp myself, obviously.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.198
Very well, sis‐‐

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:43.203
[FRANKLIN] Yu, in here, you
address me as "Leader."

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:45.580
[HUGO]
Yes. Leader.

00:12:00.511 --> 00:12:02.722
[FRANKLIN]
Now here's a sight!

00:12:02.764 --> 00:12:05.308
You're the one they call
Franklin, I presume?

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.353
And Dendro's number one
most eligible bachelor.

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:11.397
[LILIANA] We'll be taking
Her Highness Elizabeth back.

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:13.691
Yeah, I don't see
that happening.

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:16.778
If you refuse to cooperate,
then we'll take her by force!

00:12:16.819 --> 00:12:18.780
Little dangerous,
don't you think?

00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:21.950
No need to worry.
As soldiers of the Royal Guard,

00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:23.701
we're bound by magic
that prevents us

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:26.913
from ever harming a member
of Altar's royal family.

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:30.124
[FRANKLIN] Friendly fire's
disabled? That's no fair.

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:32.210
[LILIANA] However, the mere
act of pointing my blade

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:34.504
in Her Highness's direction
causes me pain,

00:12:34.545 --> 00:12:36.673
so I'd appreciate it
if you'd let her go!

00:12:36.714 --> 00:12:42.011
[FRANKLIN laughs]
Hell no!

00:12:42.053 --> 00:12:44.097
Grand Cross it is then!

00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:50.561
[FRANKLIN screaming]

00:12:54.565 --> 00:12:56.442
[FRANKLIN]
That was a close call.

00:12:56.484 --> 00:13:00.321
Good thing I had a Lifesaving
Brooch. Between you...

00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:02.824
And that Superior Killer...

00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:05.827
Today's been absolute
murder on my wallet.

00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:06.828
Royal Guard, charge!

00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:10.707
[SOLDIERS yelling]

00:13:10.748 --> 00:13:14.252
Right when I wanted to take
this baby out for a test drive.

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:16.921
Call: RSK!

00:13:24.595 --> 00:13:26.639
[YURI]
My name is Yuri Gautier.

00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:31.686
I was born in the south of
France to an upper‐class family.

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.604
My father was a self‐made man

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:36.649
who managed to accrue
considerable wealth.

00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:39.193
My mother was an
ex‐theater actress.

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:42.905
From a young age I could see
she was beautiful and kind.

00:13:42.947 --> 00:13:45.908
My older sister had both
brains and looks

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:48.202
and I'd often boast about her.

00:13:48.244 --> 00:13:51.664
By all appearances, we were
the kind of family anybody

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:56.044
would envy, but the truth was
a much different story.

00:13:56.085 --> 00:13:58.588
In reality,
my father was a tyrant

00:13:58.629 --> 00:14:01.174
who often horribly
mistreated my mother.

00:14:01.215 --> 00:14:03.051
She bore it all the
while trying her best

00:14:03.092 --> 00:14:06.387
to hide the pain
from her daughters.

00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:10.516
My sister was always kind
and caring towards me,

00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:14.729
but I sensed she had
her own worries.

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:16.647
When our pet iguana died,

00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:19.192
our grandfather made
a plaster figurine of it.

00:14:19.233 --> 00:14:21.986
Which delighted
my grieving sister.

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:25.031
The gift led to her learning
the craft, and within no time

00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:29.869
she was creating
plaster animals of her own.

00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:31.871
[YURI'S FATHER] How long
can you keep doing this?

00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:33.539
We've already arranged
your marriage!

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:35.416
You think your future
husband will love you

00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:39.337
if you stink of
paint and plaster?

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:42.632
[YURI] Soon after,
my sister left home.

00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:46.344
My father was furious while my
mother released the resentment

00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:48.846
she'd been holding
in for so long.

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:51.557
Inevitably, they divorced.

00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:54.185
Throughout the early
years of my life,

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:56.687
I had only one thought.

00:14:56.729 --> 00:14:59.732
How I should have
protected her more.

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:03.528
Both my mother,
and also my sister.

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:08.991
[YURI] If only I'd found
the courage to stand up

00:15:09.033 --> 00:15:12.412
to their tormentor,
to keep them safe.

00:15:12.453 --> 00:15:14.997
None of this would have
turned out this way.

00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:17.792
What I truly wanted,
more than anything,

00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:19.669
was to be like a
knight in the plays

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.462
my mother and I would watch.

00:15:21.504 --> 00:15:25.550
A strong, noble man who could
have shielded them from harm.

00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:28.553
But I knew it was merely
a childish dream,

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:32.181
so I kept it locked
away inside me.

00:15:32.223 --> 00:15:36.018
Then, half a year after
my parents' divorce,

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:42.984
I discovered a world that could
make that wish come true.

00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:45.903
[YURI] I wanted Hugo to be
the embodiment of everything

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:48.281
I idolized during my childhood.

00:15:48.322 --> 00:15:51.200
A brave and valiant knight
who protected women

00:15:51.242 --> 00:15:54.036
and defeated any danger
threatening them.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.915
[CYCO]
Are you all right, Hugo?

00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.418
Just lost in my
thoughts, I guess.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.504
[CYCO] If it's bothering you
this much, we can still quit.

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:07.258
No, we can't. This is
the best course of action,

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.344
and will be far less
damaging in the long term.

00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:12.805
We'll force this kingdom
to surrender now

00:16:12.847 --> 00:16:15.892
and avoid a pointless war.

00:16:15.933 --> 00:16:19.812
Besides, we're only
targeting Masters.

00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:22.440
[CYCO]
But it seems so hard on you...

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:26.360
I appreciate your concern.
What I want,

00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:30.531
and this is personal on
my part, is to help him.

00:16:30.573 --> 00:16:33.826
[CYCO] I'll stand beside you,
whatever you decide.

00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:37.455
[HUGO]
Thanks, Cyco.

00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:39.790
From this moment,
I formally renounce the role

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:41.417
Hugo has been assigned.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.379
[HUGO]
I was expecting you, Ray.

00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:46.964
[horse whinnies]

00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:48.966
[RAY groans]

00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:52.678
[RAY] "No Master shall pass
beyond this point."

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.432
So, do you want me here
or not, Hugo? Answer me!

00:16:56.474 --> 00:16:58.976
[HUGO]
I'm not entirely sure myself.

00:16:59.018 --> 00:17:01.103
[RAY]
Tell me where your leader is.

00:17:01.145 --> 00:17:02.939
[HUGO]
Just beyond the gate,

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.775
battling the Knights
of the Royal Guard.

00:17:05.816 --> 00:17:08.778
Then kindly step aside, because
that's where we're headed!

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:10.696
And you're more than
welcome to pass,

00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:13.533
but I can't let your
friends through.

00:17:13.574 --> 00:17:15.326
Why is no one else allowed?

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:19.038
[HUGO] The boss wants to
fight you, one‐on‐one.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:22.583
Do you mean Franklin?
How come?

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:27.380
[ROOK]
Go on ahead, Ray.

00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:28.506
[gasps]

00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:30.841
Before you say anything,
you've got more than enough

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:33.761
to deal with without worrying
about this side of the gate.

00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:35.137
While you have your hands full

00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:37.306
rescuing the princess
from Franklin,

00:17:37.348 --> 00:17:40.476
I'll take care of
this one in your stead.

00:17:40.518 --> 00:17:42.895
I know this is your friend
that fought beside you

00:17:42.937 --> 00:17:46.941
the other day, and obviously
you want answers, but...

00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:50.194
If you don't make it in time,
it'll haunt you forever.

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:53.823
So why're you standing there?
Hurry up and get a move on.

00:17:53.864 --> 00:17:57.743
Thank you, Rook.
All right. He's yours.

00:17:57.785 --> 00:17:59.078
I got this, Ray!

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.288
[RAY grunts]

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:05.167
What gives?

00:18:05.209 --> 00:18:09.463
Ray, I apologize for going back
on my word, but let's duel.

00:18:09.505 --> 00:18:11.507
An exchange of all‐out attacks!

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:13.593
[RAY]
Okay. I have so many things

00:18:13.634 --> 00:18:15.303
that I want to say to you Hugo.

00:18:15.344 --> 00:18:18.306
But that can wait. For now,
let's go with one attack each!

00:18:18.347 --> 00:18:20.016
<i>Merci, mon ami.</i>

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:22.727
Motor Slash!

00:18:23.894 --> 00:18:27.023
You've forced me to use
Counter Absorption!

00:18:29.525 --> 00:18:32.486
Vengeance is Mine, Hugo!

00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:38.451
He used it. Why?

00:18:38.492 --> 00:18:40.953
Surely he realized he
needed to save an Absorption

00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:42.622
for the fight that's to come.

00:18:42.663 --> 00:18:48.836
But now that it's gone,
he'll be utterly defenseless.

00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:51.213
I'm following the
plan I agreed to,

00:18:51.255 --> 00:18:53.883
so then why is this
eating me up inside?

00:18:53.924 --> 00:18:55.593
Why am I...?

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:57.845
[CYCO]
Because, for you, that was‐‐

00:18:57.887 --> 00:19:00.056
[crash]

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:05.936
Apologies, but you left
yourself wide open.

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:09.857
[gasps]

00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:11.651
Little Flare, fire!

00:19:11.692 --> 00:19:13.736
[CYCO]
You coward.

00:19:13.778 --> 00:19:16.697
[ROOK]
Coward? That's uncalled for.

00:19:16.739 --> 00:19:19.241
I already said I'd be
the one fighting you.

00:19:19.283 --> 00:19:21.494
It's your own fault you
got lost in thought,

00:19:21.535 --> 00:19:23.329
so don't try blaming us.

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:24.955
[HUGO]
For someone who's Ray's friend,

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:27.500
you two are nothing alike.

00:19:27.541 --> 00:19:29.418
You have a point there.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.963
Maybe that's the reason
I admire him so much.

00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:36.717
But that aside, I'm almost
positive I hate you.

00:19:36.759 --> 00:19:38.803
Rook, that's the first time
you've ever said that

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:40.054
to another person!

00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:44.558
Amusing. Are you sure you're not
being just a tad melodramatic?

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.060
Perhaps you're right.

00:19:46.102 --> 00:19:49.939
But I do find you
absolutely loathsome.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.108
You remind me of somebody else.

00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:54.193
They're pompous
and unstable too!

00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:56.904
You're not making any
sense right now.

00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:58.948
[ROOK]
Are you sure about that?

00:19:58.989 --> 00:20:01.617
I haven't the slightest
idea what you're‐‐

00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:06.122
That's enough. Let's go.
I'll freeze you where you stand!

00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:12.253
[HUGO] You're not getting
past me. I swear.

00:20:12.294 --> 00:20:14.547
As a member of the
Triangle of Wisdom,

00:20:14.588 --> 00:20:17.133
and as the thorn
that protects him.

00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:21.637
I see. Well, in that case,
I'll use everything I have

00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:24.265
to defeat you,
and then stroll on by.

00:20:24.306 --> 00:20:29.812
Because I am Ray's friend, but
also for my own satisfaction.

00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:32.148
High Pilot Hugo Lesseps,

00:20:32.189 --> 00:20:34.984
accompanied by his

Stand!

00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:44.869
[HUGO]
May the fight....

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.871
[BOTH]
Begin!

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:49.540
[FRANKLIN]
All seems to be A‐Okay.

00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:53.502
Its attacks are on the weaker
side, but that was expected.

00:20:53.544 --> 00:20:55.421
We'll use the stack,
Sir Lindos!

00:20:55.463 --> 00:20:56.464
[LINDOS grunts]

00:21:02.428 --> 00:21:04.346
[LILIANA, LINDOS]
Grand Cross, activate!

00:21:06.849 --> 00:21:10.436
[FRANKLIN] Not a bad attempt.
But in the end...

00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:12.480
...utterly pointless.

00:21:15.149 --> 00:21:16.233
[LILIANA gasps]

00:21:16.275 --> 00:21:18.736
Impossible! You mean
that stack had no effect?

00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:20.613
It might've been a different
story if you weren't

00:21:20.654 --> 00:21:23.115
Paladins with your Holy
elements and swords.

00:21:23.157 --> 00:21:25.743
Who knows, you may
have stood a chance.

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:28.704
Sadly, you're dealing
with the RSK.

00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:34.251
He made it, he made it!

00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:38.881
It's our boy with the
hero complex! Ray!

00:21:38.923 --> 00:21:41.008
[LILIANA]
Ray? What're you doing here?

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:43.302
[RAY] I'm not a fan of children
getting kidnapped

00:21:43.344 --> 00:21:45.763
and used as political pawns.

00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:49.809
And since I'm here, might as
well beat the crap outta him!

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:52.311
[laughing]

00:21:52.353 --> 00:21:54.271
I was just telling
someone the other day

00:21:54.313 --> 00:21:56.148
Dendrogram was lacking
players who treated

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.067
the world seriously,
and lo and behold,

00:21:58.108 --> 00:22:00.569
look who rides in atop
their trusty steed!

00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:03.405
It'll make breaking you in half
all the more rewarding!

00:22:03.447 --> 00:22:06.450
[RAY] You'll pay, Flamingo!
For your actions tonight,

00:22:06.492 --> 00:22:08.577
and for what you
did to me yesterday!

00:22:08.619 --> 00:22:11.080
[laughing]

00:22:11.121 --> 00:22:12.790
Same goes for you!

00:22:12.832 --> 00:22:17.086
Only my grudge goes back
to last week, fluffy ears!

00:23:52.473 --> 00:23:54.475
[RAY]
"The Right Arm of the Victor."
