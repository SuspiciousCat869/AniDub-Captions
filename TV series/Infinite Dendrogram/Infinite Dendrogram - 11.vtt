00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:11.428
[LUCIUS]
I was born in London.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.557
As for my upbringing, you
could say it was unique.

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.394
My father was a detective,
while my mum was a thief.

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:22.898
And though it sounds like a
joke, I assure you it's true.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.984
Fortunately, I acquired
talents from both of them.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.779
Father taught me how to hone
my observational skills,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.156
read body language,
learn foreign tongues,

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:33.075
and understand the
workings of the mind.

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:36.161
My mother gave me lessons
on how to disarm traps,

00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:38.830
find a person's blind spot,
as well as the art

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:41.333
of charming and
manipulating others.

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:43.669
However, neither of my
parents pressured me

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.754
to follow in their footsteps.

00:00:45.796 --> 00:00:48.674
They wanted me to figure
out how to make a living.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.592
To find my own way.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.512
[LUCIUS]
When I was 15,

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:57.015
both of them perished after
their plane crashed.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:01:00.561
It was only after being
truly alone did I realize

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:03.313
I had been complacent
learning their skills,

00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:06.316
and never made a
single decision on my own.

00:01:06.358 --> 00:01:09.695
I had next to no experience
choosing how I wished to live.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:12.614
Someone guide me in
the right direction.

00:01:12.656 --> 00:01:14.575
Just when I was at my wits' end,

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:19.371
I found salvation in
my late father's study.

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:21.665
He had been commissioned
to uncover the secrets

00:01:21.707 --> 00:01:23.959
within a game called
<i>Infinite Dendrogram.</i>

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:26.962
I wanted to investigate, but how
could I explore a new world

00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:29.089
when my own was falling apart?

00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:32.217
What was the game's
promotional tagline again?

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:36.597
[LUCIUS] For a person who had
lost sight of where they

00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:41.226
were headed, there
are no sweeter words.

00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:42.561
All right.

00:01:42.603 --> 00:01:46.982
I guess I'll take you up on
the offer. New possibilities.

00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:49.860
Hopefully, they can
show me what I'm missing,

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:52.195
and reveal my potential.

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:55.073

[ROOK]
Babi. Little Flare.

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.218
Coming right up!

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:48.019
[ROOK] Now he'll step
with his right leg...

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:50.522
An upward slice with
his left blade...

00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:52.357
Do your thing, Liz.

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:56.820
Marilyn! Attack him!

00:03:56.862 --> 00:03:59.448
[MARILYN roars]

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:00.657
[CYCO]
How annoying.

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:05.787
It's like he's anticipating
our every move. No. He is.

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.497
If things continue
the way they're going,

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:11.001
we'll run out of steam.
And yet...

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:12.919
I wonder how long
you can stay unfrozen

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:15.046
while La Porte de
l'Enfer is active.

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:17.883
[ROOK] Me, too. I freeze
about the same amount,

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:20.093
but the intervals are
all over the place.

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:21.678
The second hit from
the ice occurred

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.723
39 seconds after the first.

00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:27.809
While the third took place
130 seconds after that.

00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:29.478
If my math is correct,

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.981
the greatest common divisor
of those numbers is thirteen.

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:36.318
There must be some significance
between Hugo and that number.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:38.153
I need to a moment
to think, Liz.

00:04:38.195 --> 00:04:41.156
Concentrate on evasion
and defense.

00:04:41.198 --> 00:04:45.535
The skill has three effects:
Gradually freezing over time.

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:49.122
Similar to what both Audrey
and I experienced.

00:04:50.248 --> 00:04:53.585
[ROOK] But she was
instantaneously half‐frozen.

00:04:53.627 --> 00:04:55.921
Then, you have the Masters
who turned into ice statues

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:57.798
with only one attack.

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:00.091
Finally, there's
Babi and Marilyn.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.468
They didn't freeze at all.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.721
What criteria determines who
gets frozen and how much?

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:05.847
Is it only humans?

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.851
No. Audrey was affected.
Maybe the amount one's impacted

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:12.771
by the ice is relative
to their level and stats.

00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:15.273
No. That doesn't explain
the difference between

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:18.193
Audrey and Marilyn,
who have similar numbers.

00:05:18.235 --> 00:05:21.321
Maybe there's no pattern
and it's completely random.

00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:24.449
No. Luck‐based skills aren't
reliable enough to defend

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:26.409
a strategic location.

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:28.745
There's got to be a rule
governing the effect.

00:05:28.787 --> 00:05:30.997
[HUGO yelling]

00:05:31.832 --> 00:05:34.459
He's headed right for you!

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:36.253
[ROOK]
Two seconds till he hits me.

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:39.381
That's fine. Enough time
to figure this out.

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:42.217
What if I'm approaching
this from the wrong angle?

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:45.095
There's a relation between an
Embryo's name and their skill.

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:48.181
She's Cocytus.
In Dante's Divine Comedy

00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:51.351
that's the lowest Circle
of Hell, a frozen lake.

00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:53.228
Where Satan is trapped in ice,

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.689
continuously
gnawing on traitors.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.816
There has to be a deeper
connection here

00:05:57.858 --> 00:05:59.734
besides the freezing aspect.

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:01.862
Something to do
with the number 13.

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:04.155
What makes the lowest
Circle a hell?

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.199
Or determines if an act
is traitorous?

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:08.201
It'd be easier if there
were some sort of way

00:06:08.243 --> 00:06:11.121
to represent treachery,
like a concrete number.

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:14.291
Wait a minute. A number.
One exists!

00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:16.751
Not only can it be linked
to the act of betrayal,

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:19.504
but it explains the difference
with the freezing effect!

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:22.215
Why some players get
frozen more than others.

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:26.052
I understand. La Porte de
l'Enfer is counting...

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:30.307
Rook! No!

00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:33.226
[CYCO]
It's finished.

00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:36.521
Not yet.

00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:37.856
He survived.

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:44.112
You gave it your best shot,
but I'm taking you down.

00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:46.656
[HUGO]
You're resilient for a Pimp.

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:50.201
[ROOK]
Hmph. I owe it all to Ray.

00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:59.252
Yes, well, don't expect
to be so lucky next time.

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:01.963
And besides, you're gradually
being consumed

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:03.256
by La Porte de l'Enfer.

00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:04.633
Yeah, I noticed.

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:06.426
If you're familiar with chess,

00:07:06.468 --> 00:07:09.387
it'd be fair to say your
skill has me in check.

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:12.474
After all, back at the colosseum
plaza, it was necessary

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:16.603
for me to take down some
of those player killers.

00:07:16.645 --> 00:07:18.146
I don't follow.

00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:20.982
La Porte de l'Enfer,
the effects differ depending

00:07:21.024 --> 00:07:23.068
on the number of
kills a player has,

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:25.779
but only for creatures
that share their type.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.697
Seven humans, huh?

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:29.532
Yeah. If I had to guess,
I'd say that's about

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:31.952
the amount my body
gets frozen each time.

00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:35.246
Every 13 seconds,
your Embryo's ability has

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:36.414
an x‐percent chance

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:39.125
of freezing x‐percent of a
selected target's body,

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:41.586
depending on how
high their betrayal is.

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:43.004
Sound about right?

00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:46.800
So, in my case, there's a
7% chance every 13 seconds,

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:48.760
7% of me will be frozen,

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:52.681
while anyone with over a hundred
kills will freeze 100%.

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:55.350
You create an icy hell for
traitors who've killed

00:07:55.392 --> 00:07:57.936
their fellow creatures.
Given the effectiveness,

00:07:57.978 --> 00:08:02.190
it explains why you're stationed
by the escape route.

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:05.068
[HUGO] Interesting deduction,
but just because the conditions

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.028
meet your theory
doesn't make it true.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:11.241
Yeah, nice try, but I can tell
by your voice, that I nailed it.

00:08:11.282 --> 00:08:14.869
Or didn't you know?
You're a terrible liar.

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:17.622
And that's precisely the
reason I hate you so much.

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:19.249
I despise your kind.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.210
People who are obviously
dishonest and insecure.

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:23.712
People like you.

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:24.796
You're wrong.

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:26.006
[ROOK]
But what annoys me the most

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:28.049
are the traits you
share with Ray.

00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:31.011
Both of you see this world
as real and not a game.

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:33.346
And yet, this is how you behave.

00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:35.765
It's so... irritating.

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:38.727
How you've allied with Franklin
and his sick game.

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:41.021
You do realize you're complicit?

00:08:41.062 --> 00:08:43.106
Yet, you just wave it off
and keep saying

00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:44.566
there's no other way.

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:48.028
Nearly everything that pours out
of your mouth is an excuse.

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:49.237
And another thing.

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:52.240
Not only do you twist reason
to justify your actions,

00:08:52.282 --> 00:08:55.910
you claim you're terrible,
making excuses for your excuses.

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:58.371
It's annoying how
indecisive you are.

00:08:58.413 --> 00:09:01.416
Asking Ray to fight after
telling him to go through.

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:03.043
Then saying you regret it.

00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:04.878
You act tormented
by your decisions,

wallowing in guilt!

00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:05.772
That's the magic skill

00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:08.733
his Embryo was using
against us earlier!

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:10.860
[DRAGON‐DEVIL‐MAN]
Tri‐Horn Uppercut!

00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:15.115
[HUGO] And the Demi‐Dragon's
attack! Right! Let's dance!

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:21.955
[HUGO]
Motor Slash!

00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:24.749
How'd he dodge that blind? Uh!

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:28.044
So, the three of you merged.
I don't understand.

00:10:28.086 --> 00:10:31.131
How can you use a skill of that
caliber with no preparation?

00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:34.050
I did prepare.
For a while, too.

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:35.677
Got a question for you.

00:10:35.718 --> 00:10:37.887
When do you think I first
started charging the attack?

00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:39.347
Don't play games with me.

00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:40.515
[DRAGON‐DEVIL‐MAN]
Hate to tell you,

00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:43.351
but I'm the one who
had you cornered.

00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:44.978
[ROOK]
If you're familiar with chess,

00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:47.438
it'd be fair to say your
skill has me in check.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.566
We're so done with you!

00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:50.692
Check and done.

00:10:50.733 --> 00:10:53.027
Meaning that insulting speech
he delivered was merely

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:54.946
a ploy to buy him enough time.

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:57.490
Right now, my creature
type's "chimera."

00:10:57.532 --> 00:10:58.908
And since I've never
defeated one,

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:01.995
La Porte de l'Enfer
has no effect on me.

00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:04.122
So, Hugo Lesseps.

00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:07.834
Would you care to battle?

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:12.839
A duel, Rook Holmes?
Very well. I'll face you.

00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:25.435
Tri‐Horn, Grand Dash!

00:11:25.476 --> 00:11:28.313
Purgatorial Slash!

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:57.592
I wasn't strong
enough to beat you.

00:11:57.634 --> 00:11:59.552
[CYCO]
That was too close for comfort.

00:11:59.594 --> 00:12:01.095
True, but we did still‐‐

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:02.513
[glass shattering]

00:12:05.516 --> 00:12:07.393
[gasps]

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:11.981
[ROOK]
Thanks, Liz. Well done.

00:12:12.023 --> 00:12:13.358
Male Temptation.

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:15.276
Lilim Temptation.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.446
[HUGO gasps]

00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:22.533
And that's checkmate.

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:31.793
[FRANKLIN] If you'd be so kind
as to look up here.

00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:34.420
And wave to your adoring
public. Cause, after all,

00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:37.465
you're being projected over
Gideon and the capital.

00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:39.592
Wanna tell us why
or should we guess?

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:41.135
Well, for starters,

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:43.972
I'm going to snap this
kingdom's spirit in half.

00:12:44.013 --> 00:12:47.183
And for that to work, I need
the Altarians to witness

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:49.102
how pathetic its defenders are

00:12:49.143 --> 00:12:52.981
and how incapable the Duel
City was in stopping me.

00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:55.441
I can't wait to hear
the second reason.

00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:57.026
I was just getting to it.

00:12:57.068 --> 00:12:59.112
I want to publicly
humiliate the ones

00:12:59.153 --> 00:13:01.531
who thought it was
wise to chase me.

00:13:01.572 --> 00:13:03.783
You are one sick bastard.

00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:06.369
Well, that concludes the test.

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:08.037
[NEMESIS]
Hugo's duel was a trick.

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:10.790
Without a Counter Absorption,
the situation's grim.

00:13:10.832 --> 00:13:13.334
[NEMESIS] If only we hadn't
fought at the western gate.

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:16.337
[RAY] There's too many guards
around to use Hellish Miasma,

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:18.298
and flames don't seem to work.

00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:19.590
[NEMESIS]
What now?

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:21.884
The only option left is
taking damage and using

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:25.096
a Vengeance is Mine
to try and end things.

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:26.597
[NEMESIS]
Ray?

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:29.809
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention!

00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:33.896
It's time to reveal the
conclusion of my little game!

00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:38.276
Which will take place in
approximately 652 seconds.

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:40.653
When the counter winds
on down to zero,

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:42.238
well, the switch will activate,

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.782
releasing a horde of monsters
throughout the city.

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:46.784
Show mercy. Don't do this.

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:49.912
Maybe you're right and I
should hand over the remote.

00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:51.622
Oh‐ho!

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.419
[FRANKLIN] Guess the only
way of stopping me now

00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:59.088
is to get on with trying
to defeat the RSK.

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:02.717
May I present the three brave
souls defending Gideon's future.

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:06.220
We have Lady Grandria,
Sir Lindos,

00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:08.097
and the only Master
in attendance...

00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:11.559
Paladin and all‐around
Boy Scout Ray Starling!

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:13.269
When your city's
wiped off the map

00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:15.271
and you want to know
who wasn't able save it,

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:16.606
look no further!

00:14:16.647 --> 00:14:19.609
[NEMESIS] Just when I thought
he couldn't be a bigger jerk!

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:25.823
Watch out, Ray! That light
is followed by an attack!

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:27.700
[RAY groans]

00:14:27.742 --> 00:14:29.243
[NEMESIS]
This might just work!

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:31.496
[RAY] Yeah. Just need to keep
charging damage,

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:34.248
then heal, and land
a Vengeance is Mine.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.584
So, why do I feel so uneasy?

00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:38.419
[NEMESIS] There could be
more to this abomination

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:40.588
than meets the eye. However...

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:43.007
[FRANKLIN] Oh, I forgot to talk
about this little darling.

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:45.176
Its barrier is
linked to the RSK.

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:46.928
If you want to save
the princess,

00:14:46.969 --> 00:14:49.222
you'll have to defeat
my creation first.

00:14:49.263 --> 00:14:51.307
[NEMESIS] He's not leaving us
with any other choice...

00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:52.725
You know what to do, Nemesis.

00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:53.601
[NEMESIS]
Right!

00:14:53.643 --> 00:14:56.979
[RAY yells]

00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:00.233
[NEMESIS]
Your damage total...

00:15:00.274 --> 00:15:01.609
Sounds like something's wrong.

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:04.570
[NEMESIS] The damage is clearly
coming from the RSK monster,

00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:08.241
but it feels like it's scattered
all over the place.

00:15:08.282 --> 00:15:09.992
Let's try using it once.

00:15:10.034 --> 00:15:12.495
[NEMESIS] We won't have
enough saved up to kill it.

00:15:12.537 --> 00:15:15.164
Rather than having to deal
with something unexpected

00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:16.707
when we go for
the finishing move,

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:19.544
let's confirm our
suspicions now.

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:21.963
[RAY, NEMESIS]
Vengeance is Mine!

00:15:24.006 --> 00:15:25.842
[NEMESIS]
That's impossible!

00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:29.595
No effect?

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:32.014
[FRANKLIN] Oh, man,
that look on your face!

00:15:32.056 --> 00:15:33.266
You're really pissing me off!

00:15:33.307 --> 00:15:38.187
[laughing] But how? But why?
It should've worked!

00:15:38.229 --> 00:15:40.398
Vengeance is Mine
always saves our butts!

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.151
Pretty uncanny, right?
Look familiar?

00:15:43.192 --> 00:15:46.112
It's the animal ear elixir
I gave you. But wait!

00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:47.780
There's more to it.

00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:51.075
For instance, the slime
concealed in every vial.

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:53.870
This fella hangs out inside
your body for 24 hours,

00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:57.248
transmitting your data to me.
So, by the time it's digested,

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:58.791
I've gotten to know
you real well,

00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:00.668
since not only am I
privy to your stats,

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.879
but also any conversations
you've might have had.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.464
What? No way!

00:16:04.505 --> 00:16:07.216
[FRANKLIN] You and your Embryo's
skills, equipment abilities,

00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:08.468
learnable battle moves.

00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:10.344
I received all the
information I needed,

00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:13.598
thanks to your little run‐in
with the Gouz‐Maise gang.

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:16.058
Then made RSK here to
counter everything you had

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.437
at your disposal. Vengeance is
Mine, Purgatorial Flames,

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:22.690
Hellish Miasma,
you name it. After all...

00:16:22.732 --> 00:16:25.276
As the name implies,
the Ray Starling Killer

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:27.820
was designed specifically
to kill you.

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:29.071
He's insane.

00:16:29.113 --> 00:16:32.825
Why would a Superior go to such
great lengths to take me down?

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:34.368
Why, you ask?

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:37.163
Because I've already lost
against you once before.

00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:39.874
When did that happen?
We fought?

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:43.252
[FRANKLIN] You crushed my plot
to assassinate Liliana Grandria,

00:16:43.294 --> 00:16:46.172
so I came up with
a plan to crush you.

00:16:46.214 --> 00:16:48.007
If you had just minded
your own business,

00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:51.135
the bear‐dude wouldn't have been
there and the 50 Demi‐Drag‐Worms

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:54.138
would've taken
care of her, easily.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.767
But you just had to get involved
and ruin everything for me.

00:16:57.808 --> 00:17:01.437
Demi‐Drag‐Worms?
A bear‐dude? [gasps]

00:17:01.479 --> 00:17:03.940
The glasses‐man gave
me bug repellent!

00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:06.150
He said I could pick
remberries in the orchard

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:08.069
without any problem!

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:10.071
Milianne was talking about you.

00:17:10.112 --> 00:17:13.783
Lose or yield. I can't stomach
the idea of either.

00:17:13.824 --> 00:17:17.203
That's why I have
to destroy you.

00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:19.705
So you went and built the RSK.

00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:22.124
A little slow, but you
finally understand.

00:17:22.166 --> 00:17:25.127
[RAY] Yeah. I understand
I'm going to have to kick

00:17:25.169 --> 00:17:27.046
the living crap out of you!

00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:28.172
Oh?

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:31.259
Like I said back in the orchard,
anyone who sends a kid

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.804
into those woods alone
is in need of a smack!

00:17:34.845 --> 00:17:36.847
And that's exactly what
you're gonna get!

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:39.267
My fist in your face!
Say your prayers!

00:17:39.308 --> 00:17:42.186
You gonna bark
or bite, dog boy.

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:46.482
[NEMESIS] If we want to
defeat this damn blob,

00:17:46.524 --> 00:17:47.942
we've gotta figure out
the reason why

00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:49.860
Vengeance is Mine is useless.

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:51.904
I've got a theory
I wanna test out!

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:52.863
[NEMESIS]
Really?

00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:54.574
[RAY]
Promise me you won't get mad!

00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:55.825
[NEMESIS]
Ray?

00:18:03.332 --> 00:18:05.293
[RAY]
Just as I suspected.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.048
Casting a Force Heal!

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.431
[NEMESIS] Idiot! Was part of the
plan trying to kill yourself?

00:18:18.472 --> 00:18:20.600
Seeing the name
made it worth it.

00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:21.434
[NEMESIS]
A name?

00:18:21.475 --> 00:18:24.687
Yeah. It's for an entirely
different monster.

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:26.230
[NEMESIS]
Then you mean...

00:18:26.272 --> 00:18:28.983
[RAY] That's not the one
that's been attacking us.

00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:30.610
But this RSK beast,

00:18:30.651 --> 00:18:33.237
it was the only thing he
summoned using his Call!

00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:36.407
Or maybe after it was summoned
there was a second monster

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:38.242
created inside of the first.

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:40.202
I don't see what
the point would be.

00:18:40.244 --> 00:18:42.580
On any other day, I would agree.

00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:43.539
[LILIANA]
Uh?

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:46.417
[RAY] But offensive‐counter
skills have a peculiarity

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:48.711
to them. You see,
they only work against

00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:52.006
the enemy that actually
inflicted the damage.

00:18:52.048 --> 00:18:54.884
[FRANKLIN]
Well, aren't you a sharp one?

00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:58.095
Though, it's not like that's
gonna do anything for ya.

00:18:58.137 --> 00:19:01.390
[RAY] So there's a reason why
my attacks aren't working.

00:19:01.432 --> 00:19:04.185
You may be a Superior,
but not even you

00:19:04.226 --> 00:19:07.396
would be able to create some
kinda invincible monster.

00:19:07.438 --> 00:19:08.314
Eh...?

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:10.274
[RAY] Which means there
might be a way.

00:19:10.316 --> 00:19:12.777
Even if the odds
are nearly zero,

00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:15.112
the possibility
does still exist.

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:17.823
And I won't give up
trying to seize it!

00:19:17.865 --> 00:19:19.700
Ha! That's fine and dandy,

00:19:19.742 --> 00:19:23.037
but do you think you can grab it
with only 270 seconds left?

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:24.955
[RAY]
Believe me, I'm gonna try!

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:26.123
Ugh.

00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:29.251
[RAY] Nemesis. I think I know
how we can turn this around.

00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:30.378
[NEMESIS]
You don't mean...?

00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:32.171
[RAY] If he's telling
the truth and the slime

00:19:32.213 --> 00:19:35.549
was only active for 24 hours,
it wore off before he found out.

00:19:35.591 --> 00:19:36.801
[NEMESIS]
You're right.

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:38.260
There's a chance it won't work,

00:19:38.302 --> 00:19:40.554
but taking the gamble
feels necessary,

00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:42.515
even if the risk is huge.

00:19:42.556 --> 00:19:44.767
[NEMESIS] It can't be any
worse than losing this fight.

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:48.270
You've got a point.
Just one problem, though.

00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:50.523
Unless we're able to get
those fallen Paladins

00:19:50.564 --> 00:19:53.067
out of range, it won't work.

00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:54.568
[LINDOS] Sounds like you
have a plan then?

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:57.697
Whatever it is,
you can count us in.

00:19:57.738 --> 00:19:59.073
[chuckles]

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:02.451
[LILIANA] All right! I'll
oversee the rescue!

00:20:02.493 --> 00:20:04.954
As for me,
I'll keep it from moving.

00:20:04.995 --> 00:20:07.581
Let's hope this works!

00:20:07.623 --> 00:20:08.916
Now to do our part!

00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:11.919
Silver! Activate Wind Hoof!

00:20:11.961 --> 00:20:13.170
Why now of all times?

00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:17.049
Hear me, Gouz‐Maise!
And release all of your MP!

00:20:20.219 --> 00:20:23.180
Somehow, he's accumulated
more Grudge than I expected.

00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:26.559
What if he's converting
MP out of fear?

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.061
The negative emotions from
tens of thousands of people

00:20:29.103 --> 00:20:31.355
in the city because of my game.

00:20:48.372 --> 00:20:50.958
RSK! Pull back! Now!

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.835
Grand Cross, activate!

00:20:57.548 --> 00:20:58.382
Fine. Call‐‐

00:20:58.424 --> 00:21:01.010
Silver! Cancel Wind Hoof!

00:21:02.011 --> 00:21:04.805
He expended tons of
MP to compress air,

00:21:04.847 --> 00:21:07.057
then released it all at once?

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:16.400
[RAY] Don't give it any time
to recover, Silver!

00:21:23.073 --> 00:21:25.284
Get ready to fire!

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:26.827
You're just wasting your time!

00:21:26.869 --> 00:21:29.038
I told you, it's built
to withstand your skills!

00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:32.541
[RAY] So, it can nullify any
attack no matter where they hit?

00:21:32.583 --> 00:21:35.419
Then again, if it could, it's
not like you'd ever tell me.

00:21:35.461 --> 00:21:37.755
‐‐Since you're a real asshole.
‐‐It's pointless!

00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:40.007
I suppose I'm just gonna
have to see for myself then!

00:21:40.049 --> 00:21:40.925
[FRANKLIN]
Wait!

00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:44.178
Purgatorial Flames!
Firing on full blast!

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:49.016
You may be my natural enemy,

00:21:49.058 --> 00:21:51.227
but that doesn't mean
I'm the prey!

00:22:14.834 --> 00:22:19.672
[CROWD cheering]

00:23:52.556 --> 00:23:54.224
[RAY]
"King of Destruction."
