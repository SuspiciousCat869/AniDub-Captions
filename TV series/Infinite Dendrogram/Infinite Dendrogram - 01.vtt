WEBVTT

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:16.058
Finally. Man, what a road.

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.977
July 15th, 2043,

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.523
the acclaimed virtual reality
MMO <i>Infinite Dendrogram</i>

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:24.525
was released worldwide.

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:27.486
And now I had a copy
in my hands.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.447
[RAY]
Here goes!

00:00:38.497 --> 00:00:39.540
[RAY gasps]

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:45.546
[RAY gasping]

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:49.883
[CHESHIRE]
Down here! Hello and welcome!

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.387
[RAY]
A cat?

00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:58.058
Sorry for intruding.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.102
[CHESHIRE]
Mmm, real nice.

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:02.771
I like people with good manners.

00:01:02.813 --> 00:01:05.524
Oh. I'm control AI
lucky number 13.

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:08.318
Call me Cheshire. A pleasure!

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.529
[RAY]
Yeah! Same here.

00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:12.906
First thing you're gonna
need is a player name.

00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:15.033
So what'll it be?

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.743
It's Ray Starling.

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:18.579
[RAY]
Just a twist on my first name,

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.956
and the English
translation of my last.

00:01:20.998 --> 00:01:24.126
All right, I'll see
to that. And next up.

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:25.794
You'll set up your avatar.

00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:26.753
Choose your settings
and appearance.

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:30.424
[RAY] Huh. Can I just keep
the way I look now,

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:32.134
but maybe with a few tweaks?

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:34.428
[CHESHIRE]
You sure can.

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:38.682
[gasps] Let's see here.
"Adjust hair color."

00:01:38.724 --> 00:01:40.309
How 'bout blonde?

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:47.357
Yep! I'm on board for this!

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.319
Okay!

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.778
[RAY]
Uh?

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.739
[CHESHIRE]
That holds your items.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.700
At the moment, it contains your
initial traveling expenses.

00:01:56.742 --> 00:01:58.744
Five coins totaling
5,000 lir.

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:00.787
[RAY]
Woah.

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.080
[CHESHIRE]
Do you need any explanation

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:03.749
on implanting Embryos?

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.792
Wait! Is that next?

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:07.377
[CHESHIRE]
Then here goes.

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:08.587
[RAY gasps]

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:20.015
[CHESHIRE]
Implantation complete!

00:02:20.057 --> 00:02:22.934
All players get a zeroth
Embryo at the start.

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:26.104
Once it reaches the first form,
they can be removed.

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:28.231
All Embryos look
the same at zeroth,

00:02:28.273 --> 00:02:30.233
but after that,
it'll undergo an evolution

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:32.486
that's completely
unique to the owner.

00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:36.615
The possibilities are infinite!

00:02:36.657 --> 00:02:39.868
[RAY]
Infinite possibilities.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.205
[CHESHIRE] Roughly speaking,
the five categories are...

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:47.000
[CHESHIRE]
The weapon and armor Type: Arms.

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:49.920
The monster‐shaped
Type: Guardian.

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:52.631
Type: Chariot, which
gives you a vehicle.

00:02:52.673 --> 00:02:55.384
The building‐shaped
Type: Castle.

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:59.346
And the Type: Territory,
which provides you a barrier.

00:02:59.388 --> 00:03:01.348
I wonder which one mine will be.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.684
There are also rare
and advanced categories

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:05.894
the five basic Types
can evolve into,

00:03:05.936 --> 00:03:07.688
including one unique category,

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:10.774
if you're lucky
enough to get it!

00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:14.069
[RAY]
Nice to meet ya, partner.

00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:16.363
[CHESHIRE] And finally,
please choose which nation

00:03:16.405 --> 00:03:18.365
you wish to join.

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:28.375
[RAY] I'll go with
the Kingdom of Altar.

00:03:28.417 --> 00:03:30.585
[CHESHIRE]
Okay! Then I'll send you over

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:33.630
to its royal capital of Altea!

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:35.298
So, just out of curiosity,

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.676
what's the goal I'm trying
to reach in this game?

00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:38.885
[CHESHIRE]
Whatever you want!

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:40.137
Really?

00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:41.972
[CHESHIRE]
You can be anything you desire!

00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:46.017
A hero or a villain. Royalty,
perhaps, or a faithful minion.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:49.104
Choose to be a good
person or totally evil.

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:51.106
Do something or nothing at all.

00:03:51.148 --> 00:03:53.692
Stay in <i>Infinite Dendrogram</i>
or leave.

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:55.360
It's all up to you!

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:58.822
But whatever you decide,
it can be done!

00:03:58.864 --> 00:04:00.532
Just like your Embryo,

00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:03.660
you're also on a journey
of infinite possibility!

00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:06.371
Welcome to <i>Infinite Dendrogram.</i>

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:10.333
We're so happy you decided to
take the plunge into this world!

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:12.377
[RAY gasping]

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:22.137
[RAY screaming]

00:04:22.179 --> 00:04:23.764
[RAY]
That's how it happened.

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:28.101
How I entered the world
of infinite possibility.

00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:30.645
<i>Infinite Dendrogram.</i>

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:39.488
[RAY screaming]

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:43.241
Ah! I'm gonna crash!
Game over!

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:49.372
[gasps]

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:59.299
[RAY sighs]
I thought I was a goner.

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:05.013
[RAY]
So lifelike.

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:18.985
[RAY chuckles]

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:36.086
No way. This game's crazy!

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:39.256
So, my brother ought
to be waiting... here.

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:41.424
At the big fountain.

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:42.259
[LILIANA panting]

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.177
[RAY]
Should be dead ahead.

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:46.596
‐‐[LILIANA] Huh?
‐‐[RAY groans]

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:54.396
[LILIANA]
I hope I didn't hurt you!

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:56.022
Force Heal!

00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:02.737
[RAY gasping]

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.078
Would you look at that,
good as new.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.706
I'm so sorry! I should've
been more careful!

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:14.916
No. It's fine.

00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.961
By the way, where were you
headed in such a big rush?

00:06:18.003 --> 00:06:20.755
[LILIANA gasps]
I've been looking everywhere,

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:22.966
trying to find my little sister.

00:06:23.008 --> 00:06:27.387
You haven't seen her
by any chance, have you?

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:30.599
Sorry, then again,
I just got here.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:36.146
I see. No, she
might've gone in.

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:41.902
Real quick. Here.
This is how you can reach me.

00:06:41.943 --> 00:06:45.614
If you run into my sister,
find me A. S. A. P!

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:52.412
[RAY] "Altar Knight
of the Royal Guard."

00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:55.874
Weird. I shouldn't
know how to read this.

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:57.667
Okay. Let's see here...

00:06:57.709 --> 00:07:00.503
"Vice Commander
Liliana Grandria."

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:02.505
What?

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:04.049
[NAVIGATOR]
Quest activated.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.135
Search for and locate
Milianne Grandria.

00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:09.512
Difficulty level five.

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:12.432
This is a quest?
Wait, hold up!

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:14.976
I was positive she
was another player.

00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:18.063
Turns out she was an NPC?

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:21.858
Level five sounds like it
should be for a player

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.693
who's ranked up
with a full party.

00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:27.697
Why would a newbie like me
trigger such a difficult quest?

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:29.491
I'll ask my bro.

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:39.334
He said he'd be around
here somewhere.

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:43.046
[SHU] Just bear in mind
I may have to leave here

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:44.381
pretty soon, kiddos.

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:46.967
Even though I just
bear‐ly arrived.

00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:48.551
Get it? Grizz, Grizz, Grizz!

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:50.553
[RAY]
That him?

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:52.973
[SHU] Only one balloon for
each of you, now, grizz.

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:55.100
I get more since I made it up
first, you big 'ol fuzzy bear!

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.893
[RAY] Excuse me,
can I ask you something?

00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:58.979
[SHU]
Just bear with me a moment.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.189
[RAY]
Was that a pun?

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:04.275
[RAY] Is that you inside
that thing, Suichi?

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:05.443
[SHU]
Indeed it is.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:09.781
Good to see you, Reiji.
Here you go, kids!

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:11.449
[KIDS chattering]

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:17.122
[SHU] Bye, kids!
Beary good meeting you!

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:19.207
Let's start with
re‐introductions.

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:21.710
In Dendrogram,
I go by Shu Starling.

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:24.462
I'm Ray Starling.
Good to see ya again.

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:27.048
Oh yeah, nice costume,
by the way.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.092
[SHU]
So, what's first on the agenda?

00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:30.969
Want me to show you around town?

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:34.222
Actually, could you
look at something?

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:36.933
[SHU]
Ooh, Liliana's quest.

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:40.478
Even I've never taken
on that one before.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.938
[RAY]
Is she famous?

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.149
[SHU] Liliana might be
the most popular person

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.277
in this entire country.
With both players and tians.

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:49.529
She's got a fan club
and everything.

00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:51.406
[RAY]
That is a pretty big deal.

00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:53.658
Wait, what exactly is a tian?

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.785
[SHU]
Another name for NPCs.

00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:56.828
Back up a sec.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.622
You mean even NPCs
can join fan clubs?

00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:00.832
[SHU]
It's not unusual.

00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:02.917
Their cognition and
personalities are on

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:05.503
the same level as humans
for admin purposes.

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:09.007
How sophisticated.
But why would a level‐zero guy

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:11.718
like me get a quest
from a famous tian?

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.636
[SHU]
'Cause the world's realistic,

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:15.221
and just like our reality,

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:17.724
there're no conditions
for starting an adventure.

00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:20.268
They can show up anywhere,
at any time.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.354
There's an infinite
number of them out there.

00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:27.192
[SHU] Speaking of which,
was there any indication

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:29.152
as to where you should
start looking?

00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:33.239
[RAY] You mean like a hint?
It may be in this note.

00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:36.910
[SHU]
Hm...

00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:38.620
Bingo.

00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:42.415
"Dearest Sissy,

00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:44.876
Remberries were the only
thing the shop was out of,

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:46.753
so I'm going to go pick some.

00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:48.838
Don't worry,
I have insect repellent.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.675
Just sit tight, okay?
Love, Mili"

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:53.843
Is this...?

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:56.304
[SHU] Liliana must've been in
a hurry if she wrote her info

00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:58.348
on the back of this note.

00:09:58.389 --> 00:10:01.059
Not good. Not good at all.

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:02.060
Why?

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:05.105
[SHU] Her sister mentioned
insect repellent.

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:06.439
She did.

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:08.274
[SHU]
If she's carrying some on her,

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:10.652
that means she's probably
headed to Old Reve Orchard,

00:10:10.693 --> 00:10:12.987
which is outside the capital.

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:15.532
And what would be
bad about that?

00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:17.283
[SHU] I'll save you
the history lesson,

00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:19.410
but Old Reve Orchard
is in ruins,

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:21.579
overrun by insect monsters.

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:24.916
These days, it's nothing
but a big bug lair.

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.835
We've got to finish this, fast.

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:28.878
Everything's telling me
it's a quest you fail

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.422
after X amount of time runs out.

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:33.675
[RAY]
And, what if we do?

00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:35.510
[SHU] This world isn't
like it used to be

00:10:35.552 --> 00:10:37.178
when the game was
first released.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.098
There's no guarantee the
quest tians will be safe,

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.392
not till the mission's done.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.982
[SHU] When a tian perishes
they're dead, for good.

00:10:49.023 --> 00:10:51.901
We've lost heroes, sages,
knight captains,

00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:54.028
even this nation's king.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.197
Yet the world of
<i>Infinite Dendrogram</i>

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:58.741
keeps on turning
with or without them.

00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:01.161
It's that realistic.

00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:05.707
[RAY] I know her character's
an NPC, but still.

00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:08.209
So, we'd better go
rescue her, huh?

00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:09.460
[SHU]
Right on.

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:11.379
We'll complete this
mission together,

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:15.508
and shoot for the
best possible ending!

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:16.467
[RAY]
Yeah!

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:18.845
Let the quest begin!

00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:24.601
[SHU]
We're here.

00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:27.270
Now, the plan is to rush on in.

00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:30.773
But seeing how you're still
level zero, and without a job...

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:33.318
Take some of these
with you, grizz.

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:36.905
Equipping them should save your
life up to five times, grizz.

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:38.281
One more thing.

00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:40.074
[NAVIGATOR] You've been
offered an invitation

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:42.493
to join Shu Starling's party.

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.204
[SHU] It'll be easier
for me to protect you

00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:46.915
if I can keep an eye
on your status, grizz.

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:49.250
[RAY]
Got it. Accept.

00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:52.837
Speaking of which, what is the
penalty for dying in this game?

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:55.256
[SHU]
A 24‐hour ban from logging in.

00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:56.090
What?

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:59.469
So you have to wait an entire
day before playing again.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:02.639
[SHU] What makes it so awful is
time works differently here.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.893
In this world,
a 24‐hour lockout equals 72.

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:09.979
If you happen to be mid‐quest
like we are and die,

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:12.690
that means abandoning
it for three days.

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:16.736
And for a world this realistic,
it's a frightening prospect.

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:17.737
[RAY grunts]

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:20.531
[SHU] I know I don't have to
go into the grisly details.

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:22.867
I'll follow your lead
so I won't die.

00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:24.953
[SHU] Then let's go
save the girl, grizz!

00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:27.538
[RAY]
Right! Time to roll!

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:33.086
[LILIANA grunting]

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:37.882
[LILIANA]
There's no end to them!

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:40.593
[MILIANNE whimpers]
I'm sorry.

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:48.101
[LILIANA] I won't be able
to keep Milianne safe.

00:12:48.142 --> 00:12:49.727
Not at this rate!

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:53.189
[LILIANA gasps]

00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:56.276
[SHU yelling]

00:12:56.317 --> 00:13:00.488
Hope you're hungry for a taste
of Baldr's second form!

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.699
[LILIANA]
I know him!

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.451
[SHU] The cavalry
has arrived, m'lady!

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:08.204
[RAY]
Are you two all right?

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:11.291
I ran into you
earlier at the castle,

00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:12.834
but why're you here?

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:14.460
[SHU] You should've
heard my little bro!

00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:17.630
He was adamant about saving you
and your sister, no matter what!

00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:20.174
So I figured, I might
as well bear with him.

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:21.467
[RAY]
Now hold on!

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:23.428
His brother? That's why.

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:25.096
Allow me to thank you.

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:27.307
If the two of you hadn't
shown up to help,

00:13:27.348 --> 00:13:30.059
Mili's life would have
been in real danger.

00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:32.520
Your kindness
won't be forgotten.

00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:35.690
Thanks, but I didn't end up
really doing all that much!

00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:38.067
Uh. I think we oughtta
keep moving.

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:40.987
We don't want to get
caught up in another swarm.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.074
[NAVIGATOR] An NPC
has joined your party.

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:45.992
[SHU grunts]

00:13:46.034 --> 00:13:48.119
You're at level 210?

00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:50.997
I'm not even in
the positives yet.

00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:52.540
[SHU]
Ray?

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:54.792
At first I thought this quest
was high‐level because

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:56.669
it had some
kind of time limit,

00:13:56.711 --> 00:14:00.465
but looking around, I'm
beginning to have my doubts.

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:03.301
[SHU] Those six‐legged
freaks are gone,

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:06.679
we reunited the sisters,
and it still isn't over.

00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:08.181
What're you getting at?

00:14:08.222 --> 00:14:10.016
[SHU]
It's simple.

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:12.727
This is a level‐five quest,
because it requires you

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:15.646
to help out a level
200 character!

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:22.737
[SHU yelling]

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:28.451
[LILIANA]
A Demi‐Drag‐Worm!

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:33.790
[RAY gasps]
Make that two!

00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:35.333
[SHU]
I get it now.

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:37.668
If we need to protect a girl
while facing off against

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.879
multiple Demi‐Dragon monsters,

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:43.424
this difficulty makes sense,
even with some help.

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:45.218
Doesn't matter,
since two worms

00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:47.428
are no match against my power!

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.764
While I'm content to
smash you to pieces,

00:14:49.806 --> 00:14:52.767
how can I pass up
the opportunity for...

00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:56.604
Baldr! Fourth form, activate!

00:14:56.646 --> 00:14:59.190
Huh? Whoa, whoa time out!

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:00.983
Are you freezing me
in place, grizz?

00:15:01.025 --> 00:15:03.319
That's no fair! Grizz!

00:15:03.361 --> 00:15:04.779
Shu! No!

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:10.785
Shu!

00:15:10.827 --> 00:15:12.245
Look out!

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.665
[gasps]

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:18.668
[DEMI DRAG WORM A growling]

00:15:18.709 --> 00:15:20.169
I have a favor to ask.

00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:21.003
Okay.

00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:23.423
Let me handle the four
of them, but please,

00:15:23.464 --> 00:15:26.175
take my sister and
get her someplace safe!

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:28.010

[RAY grunts]

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.600
[RAY] At level zero, I'll just
slow her down if I stay.

00:15:34.642 --> 00:15:38.271
Understood. I'll see to it that
she gets to the exit safely.

00:15:38.312 --> 00:15:40.189
Quickly, run!

00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:46.028
Mili. Why'd you come all the
way here to pick remberries?

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.656
Because my Sissy's birthday
happens to be today,

00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:51.200
and for my gift, I wanted to
bake her a remberry cake

00:15:51.242 --> 00:15:53.536
since that's her
favorite dessert!

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:54.412
[RAY]
Oh, yeah?

00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:57.206
[MILIANNE] But for some reason
none of the shops had any left.

00:15:57.248 --> 00:15:59.041
When I told the man
with the glasses,

00:15:59.083 --> 00:16:02.003
he gave me repellent to
keep me safe from the bugs.

00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:04.005
He said I could pick
remberries in the orchard

00:16:04.046 --> 00:16:06.632
without any problem!

00:16:06.674 --> 00:16:08.634
[RAY]
A man with glasses, huh?

00:16:08.676 --> 00:16:11.929
What was he thinking,
sending a kid into these woods?

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:14.348
He needs a good smack!

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:15.516

Do you think you can make it to

Huh?

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:05.900
I've gotta stay here.

[DEMI DRAG WORM A growling]

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.280
No! Don't hurt her!

00:18:38.075 --> 00:18:41.787
[RAY yells]

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:50.921
Uh. You okay?

00:18:52.757 --> 00:18:54.133
[RAY]
She's alive!

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:56.510
Thanks to the Lifesaving Brooch.

00:18:56.552 --> 00:19:01.140
One problem, now that my last
Dragonscale's been destroyed

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:03.601
I'm defenseless
against its attacks!

00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:06.520
Dammit! I can't give up.

00:19:06.562 --> 00:19:10.274
This may just be a game to me.
If I die, so what?

00:19:10.316 --> 00:19:13.235
But for her, this is real life.

00:19:13.277 --> 00:19:16.614
And the thought of her being
taken from this world forever‐‐

00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:18.574
I won't let that happen!

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:27.124
Hey, are you in there?
If you really offer

00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:30.461
infinite possibilities,
then now's the time.

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:33.005
Hand 'em over! I want it!

00:19:33.047 --> 00:19:35.299
The chance to have
a happy ending!

00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:37.677
To be able to save
a little girl's life!

00:19:37.718 --> 00:19:39.261
Give it to me now!

00:19:39.303 --> 00:19:41.389
Are you gonna
answer me yes or no?!

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.099
One percent's all I want!

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.601
One percent of your
infinite possibilities!

[DEMI DRAG WORM A roars]

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:56.570
[NEMESIS] You're more demanding
than I'd expected, Master.

00:19:58.406 --> 00:20:01.701
[NEMESIS]
Then again, not like I mind.

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:08.791
Hey. Good morning.

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:09.959
[gasping]

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:11.293
[NEMESIS]
You begged me to show up,

00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:13.379
and this is how you greet me?

00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:21.762
It's you. You're my... Embryo.

00:20:21.804 --> 00:20:22.847
Now, then.

00:20:22.888 --> 00:20:25.766
What do you say we finish
this bug off in style?

00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:28.018
Since we're
celebrating my birthday.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.103
[RAY gasps]

00:20:33.023 --> 00:20:35.025
Hey. What is this?

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:44.034
Wow, a sword.

00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:46.078
[NEMESIS]
The timing will be up to you.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.998
As soon it charges,
bring the weapon down.

00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:51.584
I've given you
the opportunity, Master,

00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:54.545
but the rest is in your hands.

00:20:59.216 --> 00:21:00.384
Let's do this!

00:21:00.426 --> 00:21:02.386
[DEMI DRAG WORM A roars]

00:21:02.428 --> 00:21:04.764
[NEMESIS] You attacked
my Master four times

00:21:04.805 --> 00:21:06.891
and nearly killed him three.

00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:09.310
But I absorbed the last blow.

00:21:09.351 --> 00:21:11.896
Now... it's payback.

00:21:13.564 --> 00:21:15.274
[RAY yells]

00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:18.277
[NEMESIS]
Vengeance is mine!

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.134
[NEMESIS]
A job well done.

00:21:42.176 --> 00:21:44.011
You were successful, Master,

00:21:44.053 --> 00:21:46.889
and achieved the outcome
you were hoping for.

00:21:53.062 --> 00:21:56.190
My name's Nemesis,
and yes, I'm your Embryo,

00:21:56.232 --> 00:21:58.984
a Maiden‐Arms Type.

00:21:59.026 --> 00:22:03.197
I was born from you.
Your heart, body, and soul.

00:22:04.573 --> 00:22:08.327
It's nice to meet you,
Master. Shall we?

00:22:10.538 --> 00:22:11.497

Sissy!

00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:13.791
[LILIANA]
Mili!

00:22:13.833 --> 00:22:17.002
You're okay! You have
my eternal gratitude!

00:22:17.044 --> 00:22:18.921
Because of you,
my sister's safe!

00:22:18.963 --> 00:22:21.882
I can't say it enough! Thank you
from the depths of my heart!

00:22:21.924 --> 00:22:24.635
‐‐[RAY chuckles]
‐‐True. My Master helped,

00:22:24.677 --> 00:22:28.514
but most of your gratitude
should be directed at me.

00:22:28.556 --> 00:22:29.765
Same as your brother.

00:22:29.807 --> 00:22:33.394
I see you're also a Master who's
been chosen by an Embryo.

00:22:33.435 --> 00:22:35.896
Aren't you... a "Maiden" type?

00:22:35.938 --> 00:22:38.482

after being bear‐ied alive!

[MILIANNE]
Thank you!

00:22:49.368 --> 00:22:51.203
It was no problem
at all. I swear.

00:22:51.245 --> 00:22:54.415
Trust me, this debt
will not go unpaid.

[NAVIGATOR] Quest: "Search for
and locate Milianne Grandria"

00:23:05.593 --> 00:23:07.678
is now complete.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.264
[sighs] That's one down.

00:23:10.306 --> 00:23:12.349
Our reward's a single remberry?

00:23:12.391 --> 00:23:15.978
Seems unfair after
all that hard work.

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.939
[RAY] Know what?
It's more than enough for me.

00:23:22.276 --> 00:23:23.694
Delicious!

00:23:23.736 --> 00:23:26.572
[SHU] There's more where
that came from, grizz!

00:23:26.614 --> 00:23:27.448
Huh?

00:23:27.489 --> 00:23:28.699
[SHU] We have to
start things off right,

00:23:28.741 --> 00:23:30.242
so in honor of your first day,

00:23:30.284 --> 00:23:33.412
I prepared an epic feast
with remberries for dessert!

00:23:33.454 --> 00:23:35.456
I hit all the markets early
and bought them out!

00:23:35.497 --> 00:23:37.207
So eat as many as you want!

00:23:37.249 --> 00:23:40.628
[RAY growls]
You did what?

00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:41.503
[SHU]
Hm?

00:23:41.545 --> 00:23:42.379
[RAY growls]

00:23:42.421 --> 00:23:46.050
This entire quest was your
fault! You're dead, bear!

00:23:46.091 --> 00:23:47.843

Grizz!
