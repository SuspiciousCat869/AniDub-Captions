WEBVTT

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:12.804
[RAY] Marilyn the
Tri‐Horn Demi‐Dragon.

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:16.517
Talk about a sweet reward!
What quest did you earn her on?

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:19.353
[ROOK] I did some modeling
for an artist. As payment,

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:21.855
there were a few different
prizes you could choose from.

00:00:21.897 --> 00:00:23.941
I picked the one that'd put
my Monster Enhance skill

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:24.775
to good use.

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:26.652
[chirps]

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:30.322
Oh. I also got this.
It's called a Jewel

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:33.116
and allows the user to
store their monsters.

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:34.993
[MARIE] I forgot to mention
that I'm more than just

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.329
a pretty face.
My Journalist skill awards

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:39.540
the entire party additional
experience points

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:41.250
from battle,
the only tradeoff is

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:42.918
I can't be involved
in the fighting.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.127
Yeah?

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:46.964
But I'll still be cheering
you on from the sidelines!

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.007
[gasps]

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.717
Trouble up ahead!

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.638
[GOBLINS, BODYGUARDS shouting]

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.977
There's no way they can
hold off that many.

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:01.895
What now?

00:01:01.937 --> 00:01:03.730
Just hanging back
and watching them die

00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:05.357
doesn't sit well with me.

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:06.984
I know that it's risky.

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:10.237
If we die, it could cost us
the quest, but still.

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:11.947
Let's go help 'em.

00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:19.955
Marilyn! Clear a path!

00:01:19.997 --> 00:01:22.457
[MARILYN yells]

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:23.834
[GOBLINS groaning]

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:26.295
Not bad!

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:28.797
It's our turn! Ready?

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:30.591
Yeah!

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:32.050
[grunts]

00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:36.305
[GOBLINS groaning]

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:37.639
[ROOK]
Male!

00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:39.766
[BABYLON]
Lilim!

00:01:39.808 --> 00:01:41.351
[BOTH]
Temptation!

00:01:46.857 --> 00:01:49.484
[GOBLINS groaning]

00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:55.532
Feels like some
kinda bad dream.

00:01:55.574 --> 00:01:59.828
[NEMESIS] Good thing Rook
and Babi are fighting with us.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.039
[BABYLON]
Lilim Drain!

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:08.253
A million thanks
for the quick bite!

00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:13.300
Ha! Rookie! Guess what! Babi
just reached her Second Form!

00:02:13.342 --> 00:02:14.217
[ROOK]
Already?

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:17.638
Yep, those two single handedly
took out all the goblins.

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.473
[NEMESIS] When it comes
to one‐on‐one combat,

00:02:19.514 --> 00:02:20.724
we're top tier.

00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:23.602
But the way they work together
to mow down enemies en masse

00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:26.021
makes them a dangerous duo.

00:02:26.063 --> 00:02:29.066
Also, Babi can use the
Drain Learning skill now!

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:31.568
Very well met indeed,
young masters.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.737
If you hadn't stopped,
we'd surely be dead.

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:35.280
You have my gratitude.

00:02:35.322 --> 00:02:39.159
'Course, but you really ought to
be thanking Rook and his Embyro.

00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:45.624
[NEMESIS]
Counter Absorption!

00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:48.669
It's more powerful than those
Demi‐Drag Worms we fought!

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.171
Careful, Ray!
That thing is no joke!

00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:54.966
We call them UBMs,
a Unique Boss Monster!

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.760
[NEMESIS]
Master, this is...

00:02:56.802 --> 00:02:59.930
Yeah, the monster with
a bounty on its head.

00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:03.392
Great Miasmic Ogre. Gardranda!

00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:38.945
[GARDRANDA growling]

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:41.907
[RAY] So you're the one giving
orders to the goblins.

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:44.367
You must be mad we
wiped out your crew.

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.536
Still. You're the one
who started this.

00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:48.914
And because of that,
you're gonna pay!

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:53.251
Don't do it! Fall back, Ray!

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:54.795
[gasps]

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:56.254
[GARDRANDA grunts]

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:57.130
[grunts]

00:04:59.216 --> 00:05:00.926
[BABYLON]
Higher and higher.

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.594
[ROOK]
Where's Ray?

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:05.764
[gasps]

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:20.320
[GARDRANDA roars]

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:24.241
[MARILYN chirps]

00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:25.784
Marilyn!

00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:28.036
[MARILYN grunting]

00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:30.747
Show 'em who's boss, girl!

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:31.957
[MARILYN grunting]

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:45.929
Re‐Call!

00:05:47.264 --> 00:05:48.890
[GARDRANDA grunts]

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:53.478
Try my Lilim Temptation!

00:05:55.564 --> 00:05:57.774
It's not working!

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:00.610
Watch out!

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:01.528
[GARDRANDA yells]

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.782
[RAY] I'm through playing
around! Vengeance is Mine!

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:08.577
[GARDRANDA groans]

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:12.539
I guess we didn't have it
charged up all the way.

00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:13.957
[coughs]

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:15.959
Use a First Heal!

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:19.754
[RAY] I can replenish
the HP lost from Poison,

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:22.549
but as far as Intoxication
and Weakness goes...

00:06:22.591 --> 00:06:23.675
[MARIE]
Here! Catch!

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:24.843
Uh.

00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:29.890
What the hell was that
all about, Marie?

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:33.143
Go ahead and rub some salt
in my wounds, why don't you!

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:34.644
Uh...

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:39.983
[MARIE]
Just in the nick of time, huh?

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:44.195
All of your status ailments will
be put on hold for 180 seconds!

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:45.906
I owe you one!

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:47.741
[NEMESIS] Now that you're
back to full power,

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:50.285
taking him down
should be no problem.

00:06:50.327 --> 00:06:52.537
We've got three minutes!
So let's go!

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:54.247
[GARDRANDA yells]

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:56.750
[RAY grunting]

00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:58.627
[yelling]

00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:02.088
Winged him!

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.215
[GARDRANDA growls]

00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:09.471
[RAY]
First Heal!

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:16.519
[RAY] Every one of his hits
is knocking 660 off my HP!

00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:17.771
[yells]

00:07:17.812 --> 00:07:20.523
[GARDRANDA growls]

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:22.901
[RAY grunts]
First Heal!

00:07:22.943 --> 00:07:27.489
[RAY] I can take seven strikes,
which adds up to 4,620.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.199
Vengeance is Mine doubles that,

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.785
which means I'll take him
down over 9,000 points.

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:32.619
All right!

00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:34.079
[NEMESIS]
Master, watch out! Above you!

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.872
[AUDREY shrieks]

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:39.125
[AUDREY shrieks]

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:41.169
[RAY]
A Crimson Roc Bird!

00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:43.380
A mount? Now I get it.

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:45.423
So that's how the he appeared
from outta nowhere.

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:47.342
‐‐[whooshing]
‐‐[gasps]

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:51.388
[RAY]
Dammit. This won't end well.

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:53.223
[ROOK]
Up here!

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:55.892
You two just concentrate
on defeating Gardranda,

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:58.186
and let me and Babylon
take care of the Roc Bird.

00:07:58.228 --> 00:07:59.896
Flyin' Babi, away!

00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:01.356
[RAY]
You two are no match for‐‐

00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:03.316
Teammates trust
each other, Ray!

00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:05.068
We'll buy you some
time to beat him!

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.278
[BABYLON]
We'll be fine! Don't worry!

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.490
[NEMESIS] Master, they're giving
us a chance. We have to take it!

00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:13.660
You're right.
Less than a minute left.

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:18.373
If I ration out my First Heals
maybe I can take three,

00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:19.582
possibly four more hits.

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:20.959
[NEMESIS]
Perfect!

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:23.878
[RAY]
I'd probably be dead right now

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.548
if it weren't for Marie
and her Elixir.

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:30.176
Or Rook and Babi distracting
the Roc Bird from attacking me.

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:34.472
On this battlefield, Nemesis
and I aren't fighting alone!

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:39.394
It's the five of us. We're
working together as a party!

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:42.147
[RAY]
Ten seconds left.

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:44.816
[grunts] What's the count?!

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:48.987
[NEMESIS] Accumulated
damage is at 4,973 points!

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:51.031
We have enough, Master!

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:54.367
Take this!

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:56.661
[gasps]

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:01.875
Fine! We'll just
add it to the total!

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:04.419
Counter Absorption!

00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:11.760
It's time for double payback,
ugly! Vengeance is Mine!

00:09:14.846 --> 00:09:15.930
[gasps]

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:20.185
Ray! No!

00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:24.230
Use a First Heal.

00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:30.278
[RAY]
The Elixir's effects wore off.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.946
[NEMESIS]
I don't understand!

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:34.157
That last attack
should've finished it!

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:36.826
[RAY] Yeah, I thought that was
gonna be the death blow.

00:09:36.868 --> 00:09:38.870
Wait. I remember now.

00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:41.372
The ogre's heart lies
within its stomach.

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:42.707
[grunts]

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:48.213
[RAY] Thanks, Cheshire. But at
the same time, what's it matter?

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:51.424
I've got practically
zero strength left.

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:56.638
[RAY]
No. I can't quit! Not yet.

00:09:56.679 --> 00:10:01.184
My friends haven't given up.
And I'm not about to either!

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:05.772
[RAY] All I have to do is keep
on pushing past my limits!

00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:08.650
I can't let my doubts
cost us this victory!

00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:09.526
‐‐[beeping]
‐‐[NEMESIS] Master!

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:12.654
I know. The odds are definitely
stacked against us,

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:14.864
but promise me you'll
stay by my side.

00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:16.908
[NEMESIS]
Yeah, of course, it's just...

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.494
I wanted to make sure you
noticed all of the beeping

00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:21.121
that's been going on
for a while.

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:22.163
Huh?

00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:24.916
[beeping]

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.293
What's going on? Nemesis?

00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:30.630
[NEMESIS]
I have no idea!

00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:33.091
[RAY]
What should I do? Hit "yes"?

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:34.050
[GARDRANDA roars]

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:35.385
Uh!

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:41.724
[RAY]
That's hardly fair.

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:46.271
Listen! I'm kind of in the
middle of something here!

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:52.652
[RAY] No choice. I've gotta bet
everything on this next attack!

00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:55.572
[NAVIGATOR] Countdown complete.
Initializing powers.

00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:59.284
Emergency evolution
process confirmed.

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:03.329
Analyzing 172 patterns to
formulate optimal solution

00:11:03.371 --> 00:11:04.706
to current scenario.

00:11:04.747 --> 00:11:09.210
Analysis complete. Evolution of
Maiden of Vengeance commencing.

00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:11.504
[GARDRANDA roars]

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:14.799
[NAVIGATOR] Nemesis evolution
is now complete.

00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:18.303
Form 2 selected.
The Flag Halberd.

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:21.472
[RAY gasping]

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:26.936
[GARDRANDA roars]

00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:28.730
[NEMESIS]
Jump! Now!

00:11:33.234 --> 00:11:36.362
[RAY gasps] What just happened?
You changed.

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:41.242
[NEMESIS] Master. I think I just
evolved into my Second Form.

00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:43.328
The power coursing through me

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:47.665
is like nothing I've ever
experienced before.

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:50.126
That's awesome.
How much power is it?

00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:51.502
Are we outta trouble?

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:56.382
[NEMESIS] Heh! That big, stinky
ogre isn't gonna be a problem!

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:58.468
[RAY]
That's what I wanna hear!

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:05.433
Just one more round to go,
and victory is ours!

00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:14.359
[GARDRANDA roars]

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.158
[gasps] My reflexes
are razor sharp.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.827
And the HP bar keeps refilling.

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:27.997
Is this all because you evolved?

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:30.041
[NEMESIS]
It's a new skill I've acquired.

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:32.543
"Like a Flag Flying
the Reversal,"

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:34.671
it inverts status ailments.

00:12:34.712 --> 00:12:37.757
Not that I'm complaining,
but it's pretty OP.

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:40.468
The announcement did say
it was the optimal solution,

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.845
and they really weren't kidding.

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:46.641
All right. I think we should
go all‐in this time.

00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:48.601
[NEMESIS]
Right there with you!

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:52.689
[GARDRANDA roars]

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.400
[RAY] Ha. This trick again?
At this point,

00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:58.945
your miasma is nothing more
than a smokescreen to me!

00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:04.409
[GARDRANDA roars]

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.536
Yep. Cheshire was right.

00:13:06.577 --> 00:13:08.121
[gasps]

00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:09.539
[NEMESIS]
Looks like its weak point

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.792
is the only part that
can regenerate.

00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:15.753
So in other words, we might
as well go for broke.

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:17.171
Let's rely on Vengeance to‐‐

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:19.007
[NEMESIS]
I should warn you first.

00:13:19.048 --> 00:13:21.843
In this form, that attack
and Counter Absorption

00:13:21.884 --> 00:13:24.012
are not usable.

00:13:24.053 --> 00:13:26.889
Well we've depleted all of our
Counter Absorptions anyway.

00:13:26.931 --> 00:13:29.058
[NEMESIS]
Actually, since I evolved,

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.935
the limit's been
increased to three,

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:32.395
so we have one more chance.

00:13:32.437 --> 00:13:33.396
One problem.

00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:36.399
Don't you have to return to your
original sword form to use them?

00:13:36.441 --> 00:13:39.569
[NEMESIS] And Like a Flag Flying
the Reversal's effect will end.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:43.573
Meaning my status ailments will
come back and I'll be weakened.

00:13:43.614 --> 00:13:47.702
Fine, then I'll just have
to do the same to the ogre!

00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:52.081
[RAY grunts]

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:54.125
[RAY yells]

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:55.918
[GARDRANDA roars]

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.961
[RAY gasps]

00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:14.562
[NEMESIS]
...3,250... 3,784!

00:14:14.604 --> 00:14:17.482
...4,265! You've got it!

00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:19.067
It's done!

00:14:20.818 --> 00:14:23.696
[RAY grunts]

00:14:24.155 --> 00:14:27.367
[yelling]

00:14:27.408 --> 00:14:29.869
[GARDRANDA screams]

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:36.793
Change back!

00:14:36.834 --> 00:14:40.171
[NEMESIS]
Form Shift. Black Blade!

00:14:42.507 --> 00:14:44.425
[RAY grunts]

00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:46.344
You think I care?

00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:52.892
[NEMESIS]
Counter Absorption!

00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:54.727
[RAY]
This is nothing!

00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:57.647
[RAY yelling]

00:14:59.857 --> 00:15:01.234
[gasps]

00:15:01.275 --> 00:15:04.904
[RAY] The other head. It must've
seen our attack coming!

00:15:09.659 --> 00:15:11.244
[GARDRANDA roars]

00:15:11.285 --> 00:15:13.663
[RAY yelling]

00:15:13.704 --> 00:15:16.582
[RAY]
Vengeance is Mine!

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:22.547
[panting]

00:15:24.298 --> 00:15:27.218
Welp, we did it.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.429
[NEMESIS]
We sure did!

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.976
[NAVIGATOR] UBM Great Miasmic
Ogre, Gardranda has been slain.

00:15:35.017 --> 00:15:37.645
Most Valuable Player:
Ray Starling.

00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:42.442
Your prize: Miasma flame
Bracers of Gardranda.

00:15:42.483 --> 00:15:44.902
Now I can come over.

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:47.780
Looks like you could
use some first aid.

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:53.536
Hey, Marie.

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:57.039
Did you see a Superior Killer
lurking around here earlier?

00:15:57.081 --> 00:15:58.624
I did see someone!

00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:02.420
A man in the distance,
firing his Embryo. Pew, pew.

00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:05.673
But right after that, he headed
towards Gideon pretty quickly.

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:07.133
I see.

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:09.677
[ROOK]
Ray! Marie!

00:16:14.098 --> 00:16:15.933
[RAY gasping]

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:17.602
[ROOK]
Hope we didn't startle you!

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:19.020
Huh?

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:25.485
Let me introduce you to Audrey!

00:16:25.526 --> 00:16:27.111
[chirps]

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:28.738
[ROOK laughing]

00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:31.491
[NEMESIS] If it has a name,
then that means...

00:16:31.532 --> 00:16:33.784
Yep. Once all the
miasma dissipated,

00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:35.745
I Charmed and then tamed her!

00:16:35.786 --> 00:16:38.164
How does he know it's a "she"?

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:41.459
[ALEJANDRO] Begging your pardon.
A moment of your time.

00:16:44.128 --> 00:16:46.130
I thought my family
would be killed,

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:48.466
but then you and your
friends appeared.

00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:51.844
Your actions today...
I can't thank you enough.

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:54.388
Really though,
it was no problem!

00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:06.692
[RAY]
Uh. What's that?

00:17:08.611 --> 00:17:10.238
[MARIE]
A tian coffin.

00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:13.449
It's used to return the
dead to their families.

00:17:17.411 --> 00:17:22.750
[RAY] This is too real. Liliana
and Milianne are both tians.

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:24.877
So is Nemesis.

00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:33.177
[RAY] This entire world...
Is it really just a game?

00:17:37.139 --> 00:17:40.726
[JABBERWOCK]
Oh... Now this is curious.

00:17:40.768 --> 00:17:44.689
Someone defeating a UBM
at a higher level.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.233
Not an everyday occurrence.

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:50.069
Here's a group of relatively
inexperienced players coming

00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:53.990
together, and this one happens
to strike the final blow?

00:17:54.031 --> 00:17:58.286
Oh! Seeing how this
individual meets the criteria

00:17:58.327 --> 00:18:01.038
for giant‐killing,
this makes more sense now.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.583
However, successfully
killing Gardranda

00:18:03.624 --> 00:18:06.294
despite its plethora of tricks
and before the ogre

00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:09.505
could take on its final form
was no simple endeavor.

00:18:09.547 --> 00:18:11.799
But this does change
things slightly.

00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:14.218
Especially since I was certain
the beast would evolve

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.178
into the SUBM.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.639
Hm... But no matter.

00:18:18.681 --> 00:18:20.725
As long as no new powers emerge,

00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:23.394
a hundred Superiors
will never come about,

00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:26.439
and Infinity will remain
just a dream.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.774
We should be celebrating.

00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:32.278
So should he, this boy.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.364
It's only right for one to enjoy
the feeling of leveling up

00:18:35.406 --> 00:18:38.075
and growing stronger.
Particularly if you view

00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:41.996
this world as merely a
game and nothing more.

00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:48.502
[RAY]
Impressive!

00:18:48.544 --> 00:18:49.837
[ROOK]
Wow! Look at all these people!

00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:51.464
This place is pretty busy!

00:18:51.505 --> 00:18:53.174
[MARIE] Well, it would be
bustling as it borders

00:18:53.215 --> 00:18:57.178
Legendaria and Caldina. Nations
at peace with each other.

00:18:57.219 --> 00:19:00.056
It's a safe spot for tourism.

00:19:00.097 --> 00:19:01.265
Incredibly fascinating,

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:03.809
but just look at the
chow they're selling!

00:19:03.851 --> 00:19:05.686
I think we've earned a bite!

00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:06.812
[RAY]
Lunch can wait.

00:19:06.854 --> 00:19:10.191
We need to stop by the
Adventurers' Guild first.

00:19:14.403 --> 00:19:15.988
How much is that?

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:18.824
This includes the 30,000 lir
reward for completing our

00:19:18.866 --> 00:19:21.827
delivery quest, but there's
just one small issue.

00:19:21.869 --> 00:19:24.372
[GROUP]
What kinda issue?

00:19:24.413 --> 00:19:26.749
Turns out that bounty on
Gardranda's head was for

00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:30.795
a million lir. This might
take a while to split.

00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:33.714
[NEMESIS]
To be perfectly honest,

00:19:33.756 --> 00:19:36.133
I didn't expect there
to be so much arguing.

00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:37.885
[RAY] Well, I kinda
just wish everyone else

00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:39.970
would've taken a bigger cut.

00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:43.599
It was divided fairly, with your
300,000, Rook getting half

00:19:43.641 --> 00:19:45.643
of that, and Marie
with her 50,000.

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:48.896
Plus, the rest is stashed in
the party's communal treasury.

00:19:48.938 --> 00:19:52.024
Still, I don't think I
deserved the lion's share.

00:19:52.066 --> 00:19:53.901
And what's so bad
about rewards?

00:19:53.943 --> 00:19:56.278
Nothing, but I
already got these.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.030
I bet giving those
bracers a test run

00:19:58.072 --> 00:20:00.533
will help take your
mind off things.

00:20:00.574 --> 00:20:01.492
[GOBLIN G growling]

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:05.413
[NEMESIS] And right on cue,
we've got our first target.

00:20:07.081 --> 00:20:09.291
[RAY]
Unleash. Purgatorial Flames!

00:20:09.333 --> 00:20:10.418
[GOBLIN G growling]

00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:11.460
[RAY gasps]

00:20:13.337 --> 00:20:15.548
[NEMESIS] Didn't you
read the instructions?

00:20:15.589 --> 00:20:17.007
[GOBLIN G yells]

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:18.008
[RAY grunts]

00:20:18.134 --> 00:20:19.552
[GOBLIN G groans]

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.394
I thought I was a goner!

00:20:30.104 --> 00:20:32.273
[RAY] Right. Now that I know
how to aim these things,

00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:34.650
this second test'll go smoother.

00:20:34.692 --> 00:20:38.195
[NEMESIS]
Ooh, a Walking Grapevine.

00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:40.239
[RAY]
Hellish Miasma!

00:20:43.534 --> 00:20:44.618
[gasps]

00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:48.706
[NEMESIS] Is this some
kind of bit you're doing?

00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:50.958
Well, I've had quite
enough of that.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.418
What a trial by fire,

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.171
but at least now I got
'em all figured out.

00:20:55.212 --> 00:20:59.717
Though, by the looks of it,
I'll have to crawl back to town.

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:01.510
[NEMESIS]
Truly, a heroic entrance.

00:21:01.552 --> 00:21:02.636
[gasps]

00:21:02.678 --> 00:21:03.804
Uh?

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:08.559
Whoa! Who the heck are you?

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:11.103
[FLAMINGO]
So, you want to know who I am.

00:21:11.145 --> 00:21:12.855
[FLAMINGO laughs]

00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:16.400
[FLAMINGO]
Hup! You may call me...

00:21:16.442 --> 00:21:18.402
...Flamingo!

00:21:18.444 --> 00:21:20.863
Doctor Flamingo
to you commoners!

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:23.491
What is it with weirdos
and animal costumes?

00:21:23.532 --> 00:21:24.700
Well, if that's your name,

00:21:24.742 --> 00:21:26.952
then how come you're
dressed up like a penguin?

00:21:26.994 --> 00:21:29.455
[FLAMINGO]
Don't obsess over details!

00:21:29.497 --> 00:21:32.541
Besides, we have
business to discuss.

00:21:32.583 --> 00:21:35.336
Here. Drinkest thou this.

00:21:35.377 --> 00:21:36.420
What is it?

00:21:36.462 --> 00:21:38.839
[FLAMINGO]
A cure for all status ailments.

00:21:38.881 --> 00:21:42.301
One swig and you'll
feel like a beast.

00:21:50.684 --> 00:21:52.561
[RAY]
Delicious!

00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:57.274
Are you feeling any
different, Master?

00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:59.693
I am, like a weight's
been lifted.

00:21:59.735 --> 00:22:01.028
[FLAMINGO]
What else?

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:02.613
[RAY gasping]

00:22:03.823 --> 00:22:04.824
My head's killing me!

00:22:04.865 --> 00:22:07.952
Master! What was
in that potion?

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:10.329
[RAY groaning]

00:22:12.623 --> 00:22:15.543
The pain, did it go away?

00:22:15.584 --> 00:22:18.420
Uh! Your... Your head...
How to put this...?

00:22:18.462 --> 00:22:21.423
Uh? What is it?

00:22:21.465 --> 00:22:23.300
That feels new.

00:22:31.851 --> 00:22:35.521
Uh. What the hell did you do?

00:22:35.563 --> 00:22:39.358
[FLAMINGO laughing]
What a rousing success!

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.444
[FLAMINGO] My Animal Ear Drug
is ready for market!

00:22:42.486 --> 00:22:45.781
My sincerest thanks,
little lab rat!

00:22:45.823 --> 00:22:47.157
And while I'd love
to communicate

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:48.617
my deepest gratitude by bowing,

00:22:48.659 --> 00:22:50.452
I'm going to need you
to lower your sword

00:22:50.494 --> 00:22:53.747
before you slit my throat,
or worse, tear my costume!

00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:56.208
Now listen up.
There are three things

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:59.336
that I will absolutely never
under any condition wear.

00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:03.173
Right at number one are those
cutesy animal‐ear headbands.

00:23:03.215 --> 00:23:04.884
So I suggest you fix this.

00:23:04.925 --> 00:23:07.595
[FLAMINGO] Well, you're in luck
'cause they're not a headband!

00:23:07.636 --> 00:23:10.472
They're growing out of your
head, but I think they should be

00:23:10.514 --> 00:23:12.391
gone by nightfall,
so 'bout ten hours.

00:23:12.433 --> 00:23:15.060
Now obviously that doesn't
include the time you spend

00:23:15.102 --> 00:23:18.063
logged out, because where
would the fun in that be?

00:23:18.105 --> 00:23:21.317
I'm not having fun here.
How about you?

00:23:21.358 --> 00:23:25.446
By the way, Ray.
I've got a favor to ask.

00:23:25.487 --> 00:23:26.739
Oh, yeah?

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:30.409
[FLAMINGO] I'd like to take
a screenshot of you. Topless.

00:23:30.451 --> 00:23:32.286
[RAY growls]

00:23:33.621 --> 00:23:36.624
[FLAMINGO laughing]
Bye, guinea pig!

00:23:36.665 --> 00:23:38.500
[RAY]
He's fast!

00:23:38.542 --> 00:23:41.253
[NEMESIS] Well I've met my
quota of weird for the day.

00:23:41.295 --> 00:23:44.048
Do you know what the
strangest part of that was?

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:46.008
He called me "Ray,"

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:48.928
but I don't think I ever
told him my name.

00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:54.725
[RAY]
"La Porte de l'Enfer."
