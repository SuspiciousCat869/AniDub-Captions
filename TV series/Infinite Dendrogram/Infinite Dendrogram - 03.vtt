00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:11.678
[CROWD chattering]

00:00:12.596 --> 00:00:15.474
So have the player killers left
the hunting grounds yet?

00:00:15.516 --> 00:00:16.600
Looks that way.

00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:18.810
When you talked to
Figaro about the PKs,

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.063
he did tell you that he was
going to figure out a way

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:23.899
to get them cleared out
of the southern territory.

00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:25.859
But I wonder if he
had anything to do

00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:27.778
with driving the others back.

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:29.696
I find that highly unlikely.

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:31.073
[ROOK]
How come?

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:34.618
[RAY] He's based in Gideon,
so it makes sense he'd open up

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.954
the southern grounds
as he passed through,

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:39.790
but the other three
were out of his way.

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:41.375
Back in the labyrinth,

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:44.836
he swore that by tomorrow the
road would be usable again.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:47.089
That's great, but I'm
still curious as to why

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.299
the other PKs vanished
from the map.

00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:50.884
Once the southern group
was defeated,

00:00:50.926 --> 00:00:52.844
they may've fallen back.

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:54.513
Or maybe...

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:56.640
[RAY] While Figaro was
doing his thing,

00:00:56.682 --> 00:00:59.560
someone else took out
the others at the same time.

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:00.852
[ROOK]
Could be.

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:04.439
[MARIE] Which is precisely
how it went down!

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:43.372
[ROOK]
Sorry, who are you?

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:48.293
Of course! Introductions!
This is who I am.

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:52.631
[RAY] Marie Adler. Says here
you're a Journalist.

00:02:52.673 --> 00:02:54.508
What's "DIN?"

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.259
D.I.N, is an acronym for

00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:58.762
"<i>Dendrogram</i>
Information Network."

00:02:58.804 --> 00:03:00.764
The short and skinny
is we're newshounds,

00:03:00.806 --> 00:03:04.226
but "borderless intelligence
agency" sounds so much cooler.

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:06.853
I take it you know the truth
about what happened?

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:09.439
I'm the D. I. N, baby!

00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:10.565
[GROUP]
Hm?

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:12.359
Obviously, if you
really wanna know,

00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:14.027
you gotta cough up the dough.

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.696
[grunts]

00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:17.072
Fine, how much?

00:03:17.114 --> 00:03:20.367
Whoa! Hold up! I can pay
for my half of it!

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:23.495
So, where to begin?

00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:26.164
We'll start at the logical
place‐‐the end.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.667
The band of player killers that
stalked the four corners of

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.502
the kingdom have
been annihilated,

00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:33.171
and are currently waiting out
their penalty for dying.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.297
You said bands?

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:37.134
[MARIE] Right.
So there's K&amp;R in the east,

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:40.929
Mad Castle in the south, and
Goblin Street over in the west.

00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:42.514
These were the
groups responsible

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:43.974
for taking out players.

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:46.435
[RAY] What about the north,
where I was killed?

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:49.062
And when are you going to
tell us who defeated them?

00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:51.356
The short answer would
be the Four Superiors

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:53.191
who are loyal to
the Kingdom of Altar.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:54.526
We're talkin' players
who evolved

00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:56.737
their Embryos to
their seventh form.

00:03:56.778 --> 00:04:00.115
The PK clans would still be
around if it wasn't for them.

00:04:00.157 --> 00:04:01.575
[RAY]
Superiors...

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:04.161
First up, there's King of
Destruction, the Unknown.

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:05.996
Then Figaro, the Endless Chain.

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:08.331
Tsukuyo Fuso of the
Lunar Society clan.

00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:10.917
Finally, Lei‐Lei,
the Prodigal of Feasts.

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.212
Each of those four
wiped out one clan apiece.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.050
What's that?

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:21.386
[MARIE]
Think of it as a television.

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:23.805
While it's great to hear me
relate these events,

00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:26.433
why not peer into the orb
and see with your own eyes

00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:27.976
how it played out?

00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:31.646
Let's start in
the south, shall we?

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.208

We're brutal, but nothing
compared to the boss!

and Damage Reduction
at the same time.

out east has nothin' to do.

[BARBAROY] You're Figaro.

[FIGARO] And you're an
Armor Giant, I take it.

Naturally, you should have
great defensive stats,

toughness is rare.

[K&amp;R groans]

00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:00.368
[K&amp;R groaning]

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:01.578
[K&amp;R groan]

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.836
[MARIE] She's the spiritual
leader of the clan known as

00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:12.505
the Lunar Society,
but her religious sect

00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:15.508
started in Japan,
before she started playing.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.969
Her name is Tsukuyo Fuso.

00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:26.603
She brought her religion
into the game?

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:28.229
Like she had a choice.

00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:30.899
According to her faith's first
tenet, you're to escape the

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.902
shackles of flesh and embrace
the true world of the soul.

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:36.487
My guess is she believes
<i>Dendro</i> is the utopia

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.907
she and her followers
have been searching for.

00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:40.408
I'm not sure I understand.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.493
Now that they're here and
accomplished their goal,

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:43.661
what's there left to do?

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:45.580
[MARIE] Which brings me
to the second tenet.

00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:47.790
Once you've discovered
this world of freedom,

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:51.002
go forth and celebrate your
liberty to the soul's content.

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.754
Or something like that.

00:11:52.795 --> 00:11:54.631
Uhh...

00:11:54.672 --> 00:11:55.673
As far as we know,

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:58.343
her decision to hunt down
player killers is fairly recent.

00:11:58.384 --> 00:12:01.721
It started when someone picked
off one of her newbie believers.

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:04.390
Imagine taking out one player
and having an entire clan

00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:07.644
after you. It's a pretty
scary thought.

00:12:07.685 --> 00:12:10.563
[laughs]

00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:14.400
[MARIE] Next up, let's take
a look at the west.

00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:23.701
[WARRIOR A groans]

[RAY]
Yeah, I lost my appetite.

00:12:43.137 --> 00:12:45.598
[MARIE] Her name's Lei‐Lei,
Prodigal of Feasts.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.558
She has a nasty habit

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.311
of poisoning new
players with elixirs.

00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:54.232
We don't know why she's
going after PKs.

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:56.693
And finally, we have the north!

00:12:56.734 --> 00:13:00.947
[RAY]
Where I died...

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:06.202
[RAY] So, uh, Marie, who is
killing players up there?

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:08.204
Very little is
known about them.

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:10.540
Only that they were
hunting in Noz Forest.

00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:12.625
And they're a Superior Killer.

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:16.129
[RAY]
Does that mean...?

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.548
[MARIE] I should just
play you the video.

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:32.687
[ROOK]
Um, what is this?

00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:35.106
[MARIE]
Shhh! Just keep watching!

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:39.652
[MARIE] This part right here!
You see it back there?

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:44.449
[RAY]
Some kinda shadow?

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.618
[MARIE] That's the mysterious
King of Destruction.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.662
The shadow you're
observing is his Embryo,

00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:53.041
which we have on good
authority is a battleship.

00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:56.586
I didn't realize Embryos
like that even existed.

00:13:56.627 --> 00:13:58.838
We're just going off
rumors at this point.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.549
Based on the destruction,
seems unlikely anyone,

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:04.344
including the Superior Killer,
would've survived.

00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:08.056
Actually, despite the flames
reducing Noz Forest to cinders,

00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:10.391
we know he was able to
make it out in one piece!

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:11.976
Shocking, right?

00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:13.144
[NEMESIS]
Oh, yeah?

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:14.896
[GROUP gasps]

00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:17.815
That's great news,
isn't it, Master?

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:19.275
[RAY grunts]

00:14:20.234 --> 00:14:22.779
[RAY]
They're out there somewhere.

00:14:26.616 --> 00:14:28.534
[RAY] It's hard to believe
a single player

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:31.871
is responsible for
all this damage.

00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:34.457
[NEMESIS] I heard the Knights
put out the fire.

00:14:37.627 --> 00:14:39.253
You're a Paladin now.

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:42.298
Don't you think you ought
to be here helping out, Ray?

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.633
[RAY chuckles]

00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:49.097
Whoever this guy is,
he survived an attack

00:14:49.138 --> 00:14:51.182
that erased an entire forest.

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:53.851
The way I see it, we should
be grateful he did.

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:56.229
You and I swore to
defeat him ourselves.

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:58.231
And nothing's gonna stop us.

00:14:58.272 --> 00:15:00.650
[NEMESIS gasps]
Do you see that?

00:15:00.691 --> 00:15:03.778
[RAY]
Nemesis? Where are you going?

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.822
Uh! What the...?

00:15:12.286 --> 00:15:13.413
[gasps]

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:26.717
[NEMESIS]
Sure took your time.

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:27.885
[RAY grunts]

00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:31.305
[RAY]
Cheshire?

00:15:31.347 --> 00:15:32.682
[CHESHIRE]
Mm‐hm.

00:15:38.062 --> 00:15:41.023
Thank you, but what're you
doing all the way out here?

00:15:41.065 --> 00:15:43.943
Environmental maintenance
prep, you could say.

00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:46.904
It's not my job, but I'm getting
reconstruction started.

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:48.739
But I'm the one who
should be surprised seeing

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:53.035
the two of you here. Since
players can't normally enter.

00:15:53.077 --> 00:15:54.412
[RAY]
Really? They can't?

00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:58.833
Oh, rarely. But you do have
a Maiden Embryo at your side,

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:01.419
so anything's possible.

00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:03.754
[RAY]
What makes them so different?

00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:04.797
Well, in some ways,

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:09.051
they're very similar ******
functionality, for example.

00:16:09.093 --> 00:16:11.512
[RAY] Uh, could you
repeat that last part?

00:16:11.554 --> 00:16:15.933
So sorry! That data couldn't be
put into words and was garbled.

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:20.021
So, you should probably
forget I said anything.

00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:22.857
[RAY] Some confidential
duty, perhaps?

00:16:26.736 --> 00:16:30.072
So, Noz Forest. You're
planning to repair the damage?

00:16:30.114 --> 00:16:32.408
We won't directly
recreate the woods.

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.744
Although, we can arrange
certain factors

00:16:34.785 --> 00:16:37.038
that allow a similar
landscape to grow.

00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:38.706
[RAY]
And why's that?

00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:41.292
[CHESHIRE] This is a free world,
and we don't undo the effects

00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:44.587
a creature or player's
autonomous actions have on it.

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:49.175
There are some exceptions, like
a control AI for punishments.

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:50.384
So, hold on.

00:16:50.426 --> 00:16:53.387
If player killers don't suffer
consequences, who does?

00:16:53.429 --> 00:16:54.639
[CHESHIRE]
Hmm...

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.683
Someone on a country's most
wanted list, I suppose.

00:16:57.725 --> 00:16:59.727
You do know this
world has laws?

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:01.479
However, if a user is arrested,

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:04.065
they can escape by either
logging out or dying.

00:17:04.106 --> 00:17:07.109
We have a player jail
specifically for them.

00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:09.654
That makes sense.
If death or being arrested

00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:12.490
were the only penalties,
you'd have repeat offenders.

00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:14.575
Even if you're on
the most‐wanted list,

00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:17.745
you won't be sent to the jail
as long as you stay alive.

00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:19.705
The system in place
sure sounds lenient

00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:21.749
when it comes to criminals.

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:29.423
It's been a while since I met
with someone like this.

00:17:29.465 --> 00:17:31.759
Not counting registration,
that is.

00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:34.512
Wish I could give you
something as a souvenir.

00:17:34.554 --> 00:17:37.640
Unfortunately, that's frowned
upon for us admin types.

00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:38.766
No sweat.

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:42.144
You did supply us with tea
and snacks, so thanks!

00:17:42.186 --> 00:17:44.188
Yep! And they were delicious!

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.148
You've still got a
little on your face.

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:47.692
[NEMESIS gasps]

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:50.945
Before you go, you're heading
towards Gideon pretty soon,

00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:52.321
aren't you, Ray?

00:17:52.363 --> 00:17:54.198
I am. There's someone
in that direction

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.783
I need to thank personally.

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:57.577
[CHESHIRE]
Be careful.

00:17:57.618 --> 00:17:59.328
There any particular reason?

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:00.663
Well, let's see.

00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:04.333
While I'm not sure how much I
can reveal, I will say this.

00:18:04.375 --> 00:18:07.169
The ogre's heart lies
within its stomach.

00:18:07.211 --> 00:18:08.296
Huh?

00:18:08.337 --> 00:18:11.048
Heh! Just something
to keep in mind.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.427
Goodbye! Hope we see
each other in the future!

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.610
[RAY] There are a ton
of mission requests here.

00:18:30.651 --> 00:18:31.861
It's understandable.

00:18:31.902 --> 00:18:34.447
With the roads opened again, the
merchants want security while

00:18:34.488 --> 00:18:36.991
they make deliveries on
all of their trade routes.

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:39.076
There's something I've
been meaning to ask you.

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:40.870
What job did decide on, Rook?

00:18:40.911 --> 00:18:42.622
Oh, I'm a Pimp!

00:18:42.663 --> 00:18:45.124
I didn't know that was an
actual job in this world.

00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:46.751
So, like, what're your skills?

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:50.212
Well, these are just the
ones I've gotten so far.

00:18:50.254 --> 00:18:52.757
And based on those skills,

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:56.385
I'm thinking it must be some
kind of monster‐taming job.

00:18:56.427 --> 00:18:59.221
Know what? I bet you'll
figure it out one day.

00:18:59.263 --> 00:19:01.599
And since you were good enough
to share yours with me,

00:19:01.641 --> 00:19:03.351
here are my skills.

00:19:03.392 --> 00:19:06.395
Whoa. Both Paladin's Aegis
and Instant Wield?

00:19:06.437 --> 00:19:07.938
How cool is that?

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.609
Say, can Nemesis use Counter
Absorption all on her own now?

00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:13.694
Or that other one,
Vengeance is Mine?

00:19:13.736 --> 00:19:16.280
[NEMESIS] Yes to the first.
No to the second.

00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:17.740
In order to do that move,

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:19.909
I need to become a weapon
and get equipped.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.952
Yeah? Glad I know that now.

00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:23.871
[NEMESIS]
Hey Master, listen to this!

00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:26.832
On the road leading to Gideon,
we could encounter Lobohta,

00:19:26.874 --> 00:19:29.627
King of the Pack and Great
Miasmic Ogre Gardranda,

00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:31.962
boss monsters with huge rewards!

00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:33.339
I hope we find them!

00:19:33.381 --> 00:19:36.592
I'm not really big on
willingly endangering myself.

00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:38.094
I need your opinion, Rook!

00:19:38.135 --> 00:19:40.388
I'm thinking the Special Pudding
Ã  la Mode paired with

00:19:40.429 --> 00:19:43.349
the Death Sauce on the side
would be to die for!

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:44.850
You want in on this?

00:19:44.892 --> 00:19:48.020
I'm not really big on
willingly endangering myself.

00:19:48.062 --> 00:19:51.399
[CROWD murmuring]

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.692
Uh?

00:19:56.612 --> 00:19:58.489

I'm not surprised.

00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:00.908
Three of our five party
members are attractive,

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.327
so figures we'd get noticed...

00:20:04.328 --> 00:20:08.040
Uh! Five?

00:20:08.082 --> 00:20:09.333
You again?

00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:11.001
What do you want now?

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:13.421
Turns out there was some
business in Gideon I had to

00:20:13.462 --> 00:20:16.424
take care of and figured I'd
pick up a quest along the way.

00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:18.592
By sheer luck, I overheard
you were also headed

00:20:18.634 --> 00:20:19.885
in that direction.

00:20:19.927 --> 00:20:22.638
And I just simply
had to join you!

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:26.392
Well... I don't really mind,
myself. Do you, Rook?

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:29.937
I think that's a great idea.
A bigger party is safer.

00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:30.813
That's true.

00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:34.191
This is gonna be my first time
traveling to another city.

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:36.694
I'm pretty well acquainted
with life on the road.

00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:39.071
Leave everything to me!

00:20:39.113 --> 00:20:44.827
Okay, then how about this one?
Says it's a level two quest.

00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:47.246
"Ensure the delivery of goods
from the local Guild

00:20:47.288 --> 00:20:50.458
to the one in Gideon."
Thirty thousand lir!

00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:52.168
Well, I'm on board.

00:20:52.209 --> 00:20:53.669
Does that sound good to you?

00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:55.546
Like you needed to ask.

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:57.173
Then it's settled.

00:20:57.214 --> 00:21:01.218
Already? But I didn't get a
chance to eat my pudding yet!

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.263
[RAY] All right! Then I'll
go and get us signed up.

00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:12.480
How about we all call it
a day, and in the morning,

00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:15.816
we'll head out. You guys don't
have any plans, right?

00:21:15.858 --> 00:21:18.819
I'm good. My schedule
is pretty open.

00:21:18.861 --> 00:21:22.823
Same goes for me‐‐free.
Unemployment will do that.

00:21:24.492 --> 00:21:27.953
Then first thing tomorrow,
we set out on our quest!

00:21:27.995 --> 00:21:29.121

Goblins?

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.049
[BODYGUARD A]
Why're there so many?

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:40.925
Damn it!

00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:43.594
There's no way we can handle
'em all by ourselves, sir!

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:45.513
We gotta take the wagon and go!

00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:47.223

[GOBLINS laughing]

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:56.232
Were they just taunting us?

00:21:56.273 --> 00:21:58.943
Heh. Looks like we're
gonna make it.

00:22:01.362 --> 00:22:02.696
[BODYGUARDS grunt]

00:22:04.657 --> 00:22:06.116
[BODYGUARD A]
What in the...?

00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:08.077
[BODYGUARD B]
Impossible.
