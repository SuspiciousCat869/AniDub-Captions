00:00:08.634 --> 00:00:09.635
[SCALPER]
Lucky you.

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:12.012
Those are the only
three tickets left.

00:00:13.805 --> 00:00:15.766
Thank you kindly!

00:00:17.935 --> 00:00:19.478
[MARIE]
Sometimes you just happen to be

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.438
at the right place
at the right time.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.940
[BANDIT F]
Grab her! You're coming with us!

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:25.817
[ELIZABETH] Let me go!
I said don't touch me!

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.070
[BANDIT A]
Do as you're told!

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:32.616
This little brat oughta fetch us
a hefty pile of lir, I'd say.

00:00:32.658 --> 00:00:33.909
[MARIE]
Trying to get started in

00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:36.161
the loli kidnapping
business, are we?

00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:38.121
[BANDIT C]
Who the hell are you?

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:40.624
No one, just a
passing Journalist.

00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:43.293
Here's a breakin' story!
Your skull!

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:44.711
[MARIE]
No thanks.

00:00:46.672 --> 00:00:49.550
She's a journalist
who knows martial arts?

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:54.054
[BANDIT E gasping, groaning]

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:56.723
[BANDIT C yelps]

00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:01.019
You're tough!
Teach me your ways!

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:05.399
Hopefully those cretins
didn't hurt you, young lady.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.234
I'm no 'young lady.'
The name is...

00:01:07.276 --> 00:01:08.986
I found her in this alleyway!

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:11.321
She's here with a
suspicious looking woman!

00:01:11.363 --> 00:01:13.156
It's the glasses, right?

00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:16.159
[ELIZABETH grunts] C'mon!
We gotta get outta here, fast!

00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:18.912
Hey! What're you
dragging me into?

00:01:18.954 --> 00:01:20.914
Halt!

00:01:20.956 --> 00:01:24.042
But getting captured
would be bad news.

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.267
[ELIZABETH] Sweet and fluffy,
like eating a candy cloud!

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:43.645
So, who are you exactly?

00:01:43.687 --> 00:01:46.440
Allow me introduce myself.

00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:50.736
Elizabeth S. Altar, the second
princess of this kingdom!

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.738
[MARIE]
That's what I figured.

00:01:56.158 --> 00:01:58.368
And my name's Marie Adler.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.329
So just out of curiosity,
why weren't

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.581
any of your attendants
with you, Your Highness?

00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:05.208
'Cause we traveled
all the way to Gideon

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.919
and they wouldn't even
let me explore anywhere.

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:11.965
So, I said, "you won't be able
to stop me!" and snuck out!

00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:14.801
[MARIE] At least that
explains the guards.

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:19.431
I'm letting my hair down and
enjoying this beautiful day!

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:22.267
One problem though. Um...

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:23.977
[MARIE]
Maybe I can help?

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.188
[ELIZABETH]
I kinda need a tour guide.

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:28.774
I don't know my way
around the city.

00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:32.986
[MARIE] It'd be my pleasure
to show you the sights.

00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:35.530
[gasps] You mean it!

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:36.365
[MARIE]
Sure!

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:39.201
Yay! I want to see
all of Gideon!

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:43.246
[MARIE] Just tell me where you'd
like to begin, Your Highness.

00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:44.456
There'll be none of that.

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:46.249
The guards call me
"your highness."

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:49.586
So, what do you prefer? If you'd
like, I'll call you Ellie.

00:02:49.628 --> 00:02:52.714
[gasps] Yes!
I absolutely love it!

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:55.384
From this point forward,
that'll be my name!

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:57.010
[laughs]

00:03:06.228 --> 00:03:08.146
[MARIE]
Hold on Ellie.

00:04:41.323 --> 00:04:44.367
[FRANKLIN chuckles]
Just a friendly reminder,

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.953
royalty killers go
straight to the jail.

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:49.790
And now that all of your hands
have effectively been tied,

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:52.334
there's something I'd like to‐‐

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:53.877
Ellie!

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.045
Are you insane?

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:56.546
Heh!

00:04:57.339 --> 00:05:01.551
Huh. Seems you don't quite
understand the situation.

00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:04.179
I've taken your precious
princess as a hostage

00:05:04.221 --> 00:05:07.933
in case you didn't notice!
And right as I'm trying to talk

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:12.813
you do that! Why the hell
would you attack right now?

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:14.731
Do you even know the reason?

00:05:14.773 --> 00:05:17.984
You're either an idiot...

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:22.572
...or a hothead in need
of a serious cooling off.

00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:24.449
[WIZARD gasping]

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:32.123
Oxygen Slime,
made by yours truly!

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:35.293
What d'ya think about that?
I call 'em, "Li'l Destroyer"!

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:38.213
[CROWD gasping]

00:05:38.255 --> 00:05:39.881
[WIZARD AA]
Fire!

00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:45.387
Oh, wow. Where do I begin?

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:48.598
Apparently nobody out
there is listening to me.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.142
Here's the deal: morons who
place their Bunsen burners

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:54.187
near liquid oxygen will
lose their lab privileges!

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:55.814
Also their lives.

00:05:55.856 --> 00:05:58.024
One more small thing.

00:05:58.066 --> 00:05:59.109
Blow him up all you'd like,

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.320
but my 'lil Destroyer
will end up regenerating.

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:03.947
That brainlet's interference
totally made me

00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:05.824
lose my train of thought,
but anyway...

00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:09.160
I think I'm free to speak my
demands now, don't you?

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:11.454
A brief demonstration.

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:12.539
[CROWD murmuring]

00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:15.375
[FRANKLIN] This switch is linked
to several gadgets I've set,

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:17.335
and just one press
will release a monster

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:18.962
from any random device.

00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:20.255
Even if I don't press it,

00:06:20.297 --> 00:06:23.216
they'll all be released
in about an hour or so.

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:24.968
Oh, and by the way.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.847
I have untold numbers of them
placed around Gideon.

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:31.474
There are two ways
to shut them down.

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:34.185
You can try your luck
destroying the trigger,

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:37.272
or somehow get me to
take the death penalty.

00:06:37.314 --> 00:06:39.107
Easy, right?

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:42.736
Now that you Masters
know the rules...

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:45.405
Let the games begin!

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:47.574
Who's this maniac think he is?

00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:48.783
[SHU]
Beary odd,

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:51.786
he told his plan like a
stereotypical villain.

00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:54.831
Giving us everything
we needed to win.

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:55.832
You're right.

00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:56.958
This is just a guess,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.710
but I think the point is
to make it seem like

00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:00.837
disaster's avoidable,
so if we fail,

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.839
the Masters'll look helpless.

00:07:02.881 --> 00:07:04.341
That would lower morale.

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:05.675
[GROUP grunts]

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:07.594
[ROOK]
What's through there?

00:07:07.636 --> 00:07:09.763
[SHU]
The lobby. C'mon.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:14.309
Huh? Where's Marie?

00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:22.525
It'll give way eventually!

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:24.361
What was that?

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:25.946
[FRANKLIN] Sounds like
we've got some players

00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:29.449
trying to brute‐force their
way through the barrier.

00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:35.288
[FRANKLIN] Don't pretend
you didn't miss me.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.457
There's one thing
I forgot to mention.

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:39.376
Every time you
attack the barrier,

00:07:39.417 --> 00:07:42.462
a monster gets released
somewhere inside the city.

00:07:42.504 --> 00:07:44.547
But if you manage
to break through,

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:46.591
then all of them will be freed.

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:49.135
So, please! Keep it up, guys!

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:52.430
You're the real monster!

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:53.932
Things just got worse.

00:07:53.974 --> 00:07:56.810
At this rate, I don't see how
the kingdom's Masters can win.

00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:58.687
Let's say his plan works.

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:01.690
Like, the only thing he can
really do is gloat, right?

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:04.609
Maybe, if we're only
talking about us Masters,

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:06.486
but there are others
who will suffer.

00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:08.446
Namely, the tians who live here.

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:11.157
He's set it up so the
kingdom's poised to lose.

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:13.076
Even before the
second war begins.

00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:14.077
Bingo.

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:15.495
[RAY grunts]

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:25.672
Of all places, why'd
you attack Gideon?

00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:29.551
[FRANKLIN laughs]
Duel City loves entertainment.

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:30.760
It's the perfect venue

00:08:30.802 --> 00:08:33.430
to mark the end of all
that war business.

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:35.974
This land's strongest
knight, greatest mage,

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:38.977
and its kind,
fatherly king all dead!

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:41.604
You know your countryfolk
are fleeing in terror?

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:43.356
Despite that,
this scrappy nation

00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:46.443
hasn't thrown in the towel.
Why do you suppose that is?

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:48.403
Everyone thinks you
lost the war because

00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:51.406
your top ranked players
didn't participate.

00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:55.660
They're not entirely wrong.
No one was there to stop us.

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:57.787
Thus, you threw the
Clash of the Superiors

00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:59.748
to prove you'd win the next one.

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:03.001
Parading your Masters around
and boosting your esteem.

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:06.546
"Look how strong they are!"
"We've still got it!"

00:09:06.588 --> 00:09:09.507
To be blunt, that pisses me off!

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:12.010
Could you imagine what'd happen
if this country's Superiors

00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:16.181
actually took part in the next
war? It'd be a disaster.

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:18.183
Which is why I
made my appearance.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:21.144
To break your spirit beforehand.

00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:22.771
Imagine what this
kingdom will think

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:25.190
when they find out their Masters
sat back while the city

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:29.277
was torn to shreds and their
princess was kidnapped!

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:31.279
It'd be a repeat of
the previous war

00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:34.032
and the tians would lose faith
in the Masters again,

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:37.994
as well as the will to resist
the Dryfe Imperium.

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:40.497
You have my sympathy.

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:43.041
Because, when the Masters
do come to save me,

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:45.502
it's not going to end
too well for you.

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:50.965
[NEMESIS]
Brother Bear.

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:52.592
I know that we're stuck in here,

00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:54.177
but what about
this city's forces?

00:09:54.219 --> 00:09:55.637
How strong are they?

00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:58.389
[SHU] I'd say the majority
of battle‐oriented jobs

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.475
came to watch the fights.

00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:02.977
Any Masters outside most
likely aren't equipped

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:05.063
to battle Franklin's gang.

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:06.940
But surely there's some
who aren't trapped

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:09.359
in the colosseum
that can put up a fight.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.903
[SHU] Look, Preventive measures
have been taken against anyone

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:13.488
who would pose a threat.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.865
Those are Franklin's
people, no doubt.

00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:19.410
Imagine if the monsters and
those players ran amok.

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:22.205
Great. So, we're stuck here.

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:27.418
If only we could pass through
this damn barrier.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.962
[RAY gasps]

00:10:29.003 --> 00:10:30.255
[WIZARD C]
It doesn't affect you?

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:33.383
Do you have some kind
of barrier crossing skill?

00:10:33.424 --> 00:10:34.968
I shouldn't.

00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:36.886
[SHU]
Wait. What level are you?

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:39.013
Forty‐one. Why do you ask?

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:42.100
[SHU]
Now I get it, grizz! Ha, ha!

00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:46.229
They're using arena bear‐iers!
That's why you can pass through!

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:48.898
[RAY] You'll have to remind me.
Why's that matter?

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.151
[SHU] The bear‐ier is for
the audience's protection,

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:53.945
restricting traffic
from leaving or coming in.

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:55.947
That's why players
level 50 and below

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:57.657
can't take part in matches.

00:10:57.699 --> 00:11:00.743
They'd be able pass straight
through the protective shield.

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:03.204
Oh, right! So that means...

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:05.165
Find every Master
level 50 and below

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:07.000
in the colosseum
and bring them here!

00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:09.627
[WIZARD E] Masters level 51
and up with support jobs,

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:11.880
set up the rookies with
buffs and autoheals!

00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:14.591
[ROOK] Pretty glaring
loophole to overlook.

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:16.509
[SHU]
Yeah. I doubt Franklin

00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:19.137
would make such
a simple mistake.

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:23.099
Ray, we have a shot. But in
all likelihood it's a trap.

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:24.893
Even if it isn't, bear in mind

00:11:24.934 --> 00:11:27.020
not only are we up
against elite players

00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:30.899
and an army of monsters, but
also Franklin, a Superior.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:35.612
Death is almost certain. So, do
you still want to forge ahead?

00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:37.906
Let me ask you something, bro.

00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:40.533
A young girl was kidnapped
right in front of me,

00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:43.369
and this city's about to
be plunged into chaos.

00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:45.663
And now, I find out I'm
in a position to shake up

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:49.375
this evil plan. You think I
could just stand by?

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:51.336
[SHU]
Figured you'd say that.

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:55.089
I'm out of Brooches and down
to my Last Dragonscale Ward.

00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:56.549
Take it.

00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:59.093
Sure. Thank you.

00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:02.263
[SHU]
Make things grizzly for them,

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:04.098
but don't go and get
yourself killed.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.060
When the barrier's down,
I'll join you.

00:12:07.101 --> 00:12:10.605
I'll be relying on you, bro.
Take care.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.152
Well, Ray, ready?

00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:17.612
[RAY]
Yeah!

00:12:20.698 --> 00:12:23.159
We're gonna take this city back!

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:26.746
[RYZAC] Out of all the jobs
he could've assigned,

00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:29.415
Franklin set us up with
a pretty sweet deal.

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:32.043
You said it. We just have to
take care of any newbies

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:33.336
who pass through the barrier.

00:12:33.378 --> 00:12:35.672
Then defect to Dryfe,
bing bang boom,

00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:37.048
we'll all be set up for good.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.883
Hell, yeah! Still though,

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:42.679
as a former Altar Master,
it does sting just a tiny bit!

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.596
Are you sure?

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:45.431
'Cause if I didn't know any
better, I'd say you were

00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:47.183
looking forward to gettin'
aggro on these noobs.

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:50.061
[MOHAWK RED laughs]

00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:55.191
Well, well. Look who decided
to come out and play.

00:12:55.233 --> 00:12:57.068
It's quest time, finally.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.445
We're up!
Prep an AOE spell, Red.

00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:02.156
Comin' up!

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:03.074
Huh?

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:06.869
Hellish Miasma!
Firing on full power!

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:11.124
Poisonous gas?

00:13:11.165 --> 00:13:14.711
And it gives three debuffs?
How's that possible?

00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:18.589
[RYZAC] A low‐rank noobie
shouldn't be able

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.341
to use an item like that!

00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:21.217
Now, Red!

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:23.845
You don't have
to tell me twice!

00:13:26.264 --> 00:13:27.890
Shoot! The last thing we want

00:13:27.932 --> 00:13:31.728
is some kinda surprise
attack in this fog!

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:32.895
[MARILYN roars]

00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:35.106
They have beasts?

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:36.607
[WIZARDS scream]

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:37.859
There's no way.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.778
I am not gonna let some
low‐level scrub beat me!

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.323
[MYANNA] Fire off the spell
before they hit us again!

00:13:43.364 --> 00:13:44.782
Crimson Sphe‐‐

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:46.409
Silence.

00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:47.785
[MOHAWK RED gasping]

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:49.037
Why'd you stop casting?

00:13:49.078 --> 00:13:52.582
It wasn't me, man!
Some loser cancelled my magic!

00:13:52.623 --> 00:13:53.875
[AUDREY roars]

00:13:53.916 --> 00:13:56.044
[WIZARDS yelling]

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:01.132
[growls] We've put more
hours into this game

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:04.469
than any of these guys! Push
those noobs back into the arena!

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.303
On it!

00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:07.638
Here comes the pain! Ah!

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:12.477
[RYZAC]
What's with the friendly fire?

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:14.228
Don't tell me...

00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:18.274
[RYZAC]
Charm? But... that's crazy!

00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:20.860
Lilim Temptation!

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.531
Myanna! Heal us, now!

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:27.408
Don't tell me
they got you, too!

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:30.286
[WIZARD K yelps]

00:14:30.328 --> 00:14:32.121
At least we still have Red.

00:14:32.163 --> 00:14:34.040
[yells]

00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:35.541
[WIZARD L groans]

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:43.174
Found ya! Crimson Sphere!

00:14:43.966 --> 00:14:45.426
[RAY grunts]

00:14:45.468 --> 00:14:50.723
[MOHAWK RED laughs]

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:52.308
[RAY grunts]

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.518
Man!

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:57.855
Ha! Vengeance is Mine!

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:02.860
[RYZAC] If we lose, our betrayal
was all for nothing!

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:13.621
Neat trick you got there.
Durandal!

00:15:27.969 --> 00:15:29.679
[RYZAC]
You're finished!

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:34.725
[RYZAC yells]

00:15:52.368 --> 00:15:54.328
[ROOK] Even higher‐ranked
players can be defeated

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.122
if you find an opening.

00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:57.748
See ya.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:01.377
[RYZAC] Dammit. If I'd known
we had noobies like this

00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:04.505
I would've never turned
my back on the kingdom.

00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:12.763
[FRANKLIN] That was...
faster than I was expecting.

00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:14.849
[ELIZABETH]
What're you're looking at?

00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:16.476
Just don't drop it.

00:16:16.517 --> 00:16:19.520
[ELIZABETH]
Uh. Are those lights Masters?

00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:21.272
[FRANKLIN]
You're a sharp one.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:25.526
Red are the heroes, me and my
crew, and blue is your kingdom.

00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:28.738
This land does have its fair
share of powerhouse players.

00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:31.574
Though, why some chose not to
attend the matches, I can't say.

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:33.659
[WIZARD N] Franklin, help!
We need backup!

00:16:33.701 --> 00:16:38.831
Ran into sixth in the duel
rankings, Kamen Rider!

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:40.875
See what I mean?

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:43.127
Club. Move to C‐three.

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:44.045
[ELIZABETH]
Like cards?

00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:46.589
[FRANKLIN] Yeah. I wanted
the map to be original.

00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:49.091
Have a certain je ne sais quo.

00:16:56.265 --> 00:16:58.226
You've got the club,
heart, and diamond,

00:16:58.267 --> 00:17:00.645
but I don't see the
spade symbol anywhere.

00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:04.148
Spade is my backup
backup plan. At the rate

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.943
things are going, they won't
even need to show up at all.

00:17:06.984 --> 00:17:08.486
[gasps]

00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:15.618
[ELIZABETH] You're using the map
to stay away from the Masters.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.411
Why? Are you scared of them?

00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:20.331
[FRANKLIN] Truthfully,
I'm a bit of a weakling.

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:22.291
You could argue
I'm being paranoid

00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:25.461
since we're protected up here.
The only Superiors who could

00:17:25.503 --> 00:17:28.506
get past the wall of
monsters work for me.

00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:40.142
[ELIZABETH screams]

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:46.315
[FRANKLIN]
I did overlook someone.

00:17:46.357 --> 00:17:48.359
A Master without a
seventh form Embryo

00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:50.444
that could make it
past my obstacles.

00:17:50.486 --> 00:17:53.322
The one they call
The Superior Killer.

00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:00.413
I meant to ask this earlier,

00:18:00.454 --> 00:18:03.291
but why is it that you think we
should head in this direction?

00:18:03.332 --> 00:18:05.376
Call it a hunch.

00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:07.253
Look to the west.

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:10.214
Something's waiting
for us there.

00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:13.092
[RAY] If the west gate holds
any real importance,

00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:15.720
I'd bet he must be
blocking it himself.

00:18:19.807 --> 00:18:21.392
[ELIZABETH]
Is that you, Marie?

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:24.645
Well, of course. Who else
were you expecting?

00:18:24.687 --> 00:18:28.566
I'm glad I get to see you again.
But how did you...?

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:30.693
There will be plenty of
time for us to catch up,

00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:33.070
but first, let's
get you to safety.

00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:35.156
This can help us escape.

00:18:35.197 --> 00:18:36.365
[MARIE]
What're these dots?

00:18:36.407 --> 00:18:38.034
[ELIZABETH]
Red means they're from Dryfe.

00:18:38.075 --> 00:18:46.584
[MARIE] So, it's like a
detector? That is useful!

00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:47.918
You have any idea what these

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.546
large playing‐card symbols
are supposed to represent?

00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:52.256
The diamond is Franklin.

00:18:52.298 --> 00:18:55.635
The heart and club are a couple
of friends he brought with him.

00:18:57.303 --> 00:19:00.890
[MARIE] How's that rat still
alive? It doesn't make sense.

00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:04.310
His HP should've been
depleted ten times over.

00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:05.353
Doesn't matter.

00:19:05.394 --> 00:19:08.731
First thing is, I've gotta get
Ellie back to the arena.

00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:11.984
He'll keep her safe,
even against Franklin.

00:19:12.026 --> 00:19:14.737
Look! We're almost at
the colosseum, Ellie!

00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:16.113
[ELIZABETH]
Yeah‐‐

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:17.865
[MARIE gasps]

00:19:21.035 --> 00:19:24.080
[FRANKLIN] I'm reclaiming the
princess, thank you very much.

00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:26.499
[MARIE] Are you cheating?
We should've been outside

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.668
the Castling skill's
effective range.

00:19:28.709 --> 00:19:30.419
[FRANKLIN]
I Castled via monsters

00:19:30.461 --> 00:19:32.505
I'd placed throughout the town.

00:19:32.546 --> 00:19:33.756
[MARIE growls]

00:19:33.798 --> 00:19:36.967
[FRANKLIN] You really did a
number on me, Superior Killer.

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:39.595
Without vassals to
transfer my damage to,

00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:41.722
I would've bitten the big one.

00:19:41.764 --> 00:19:44.141
[MARIE] Shame. I really wanted
you to eat the penalty.

00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:49.730
[FRANKLIN] Whoa!
You're vicious! I like that!

00:19:49.772 --> 00:19:53.484
Club, do something about
this problem, would ya?

00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:55.111
[MARIE grunts]

00:19:59.323 --> 00:20:01.534
[FRANKLIN]
This should be more your tempo.

00:20:01.575 --> 00:20:05.037
Eh? I brought him along to
deal with special cases.

00:20:05.079 --> 00:20:07.665
And you are certainly that.

00:20:18.092 --> 00:20:21.220
[MARIE] Here I was thinking you
were just a talented quartet.

00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:27.601
I bet I know who your
patron is. Franklin. Right?

00:20:27.643 --> 00:20:29.687
[VELDORBELL]
Affirmative.

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:31.564
[MARIE]
May I ask you for your name?

00:20:31.605 --> 00:20:34.525
[VELDORBELL] Certainly.
I am the club on the board.

00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:38.571
Veldorbell, King of Orchestras,
the Superior Conductor job.

00:20:38.612 --> 00:20:39.947
And you are?

00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:43.909
[MARIE]
Who am I? The Superior Onmitsu.

00:20:43.951 --> 00:20:47.580
Job... Death Shadow.
Marie Adler.

00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:50.499
And you're in my way, so if
you could hurry up and die.

00:20:50.541 --> 00:20:52.877
[VELDORBELL] Dear listener,
don't be in a rush.

00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:56.046
Take in my requiem
before you depart.

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:58.799
[WIZARDS murmuring]

00:20:58.841 --> 00:21:00.926
[WIZARD O]
This some kinda joke?

00:21:00.968 --> 00:21:03.554
[WIZARD P]
Past the sign! It's a mech!

00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:06.182
From the Dryfe Imperium,
by the looks of it.

00:21:06.223 --> 00:21:08.058
Let's give him a proper welcome!

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.352
[WIZARDS chattering, laughing]

00:21:10.394 --> 00:21:12.855
Cyco, would you mind?

00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:14.356
Not at all.

00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:22.782
[WIZARD P] They were taken out
in one attack? But...

00:21:22.823 --> 00:21:24.950
[WIZARD O]
Must be an Embryo skill.

00:21:24.992 --> 00:21:26.577
They're under level 100.

00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:28.788
Not as if it makes
much of a difference.

00:21:28.829 --> 00:21:30.790
[WIZARD CC] What is this?
A freeze spell?

00:21:30.831 --> 00:21:32.208
[CYCO]
Given how low they are,

00:21:32.249 --> 00:21:34.627
I suppose they're
both support jobs.

00:21:34.668 --> 00:21:38.255
[HUGO] A Bishop or something.
We have no choice.

00:21:41.592 --> 00:21:43.636
Damn.

00:21:43.677 --> 00:21:46.889
[CYCO]
Master. One left.

00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:48.516
So what's the hold up?

00:21:48.557 --> 00:21:51.435
Or are you not sure you can
extinguish these flames?

00:21:51.477 --> 00:21:53.103
You're welcome to try!

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:54.855
I'm afraid that I can't
let you pass.

00:21:54.897 --> 00:21:57.191
[BISHMAL yells]

00:22:01.278 --> 00:22:02.863
[CYCO]
Doesn't matter the temp,

00:22:02.905 --> 00:22:05.991
my La Porte de l'Enfer
freezes everything.

00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:08.369
Gideon's Masters are powerful.

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:10.538
Far tougher than I'll ever be.

00:22:10.579 --> 00:22:14.166
Veteran fighters who have
experience battling people.

00:22:14.208 --> 00:22:16.293
And this is where it got them.

00:22:16.335 --> 00:22:18.879
They'll never win against me.

00:22:18.921 --> 00:22:20.089
Never.

00:23:52.765 --> 00:23:55.059
