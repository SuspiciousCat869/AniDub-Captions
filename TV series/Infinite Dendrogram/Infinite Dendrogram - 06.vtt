[MAISE]
Die.

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:20.521
[MAISE] Naturally, you'd let
your guard down around a child.

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:23.357
Unfortunately for you,
this one was armed

00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:26.860
with a dagger that inflicts
Poison and Paralysis.

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:32.741
[MAISE]
Don't ignore me!

00:00:32.783 --> 00:00:34.243
I know you're not dead.

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:37.162
Think your immortality
makes you superior?

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:39.873
[MAISE]
Very soon, I'll be too.

00:00:39.915 --> 00:00:43.168
After becoming the
King of Corpses.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.629
I've already created
the Crystal of Resentment

00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:48.882
and converted 5,000 years
of life into the undead.

00:00:48.924 --> 00:00:53.220
I had to be patient, but
finally, my dreams are at hand!

00:00:53.262 --> 00:00:55.514
All that's left is to kill
the remaining children

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:57.724
and turn them into
materials for my undead.

00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:58.725

[screaming]

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:04.064
[RAY]
So you're the one who

00:01:04.106 --> 00:01:07.651
brought those kids
back from the grave.

00:01:07.693 --> 00:01:10.404
I made a promise to find
the bastard responsible

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:12.072
and make him pay.

00:01:12.114 --> 00:01:13.782
[gasping]

00:01:13.824 --> 00:01:16.493
For all the suffering
you've inflicted...

00:01:16.535 --> 00:01:18.954
...you'll pay with your life!

00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:53.715
For all the suffering

[MAISE] His blade. Even with
my regenerative powers,

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.735
a lich can't survive
being struck

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:16.405
by a weapon with
Purifying Silverlight!

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:19.825
Awaken, Undead and serve me!

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:24.621

00:03:33.255 --> 00:03:34.631

Immortal beast!

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:38.051
I've never seen a Master

Help me, Gouz!

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:53.483
[MAISE]
Where are you?!

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:01.616
[HUGO]
Make your choice.

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:05.287
Hell or divine punishment.
Which will it be?

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:06.663
You don't give me demands!

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:08.540
Do you know who
you're talking to?

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:11.501
[MAISE] I've come so far‐‐
I'm nearly the King of Corpses!

00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:13.795
Dying now would be a waste!

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:15.380
[HUGO]
Can't decide?

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:17.966
I'll choose for you:
divine punishment!

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:20.218
[MAISE gasping]

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:25.849
[MAISE whimpers]

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:32.314
[MAISE] I still have the
Crystal of Resentment.

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:35.567
Once it's used up, I can't
become the King of Corpses!

00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:38.612
But I can't die. Not here!

00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:41.323
Not by your hand!
It's worth it!

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:44.117
If only to see the both
of you cut down!

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:46.495
[MAISE] Behold, the most
powerful offensive magic

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:47.913
a Lich can wield!

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:50.665
Deadly Mixer!

00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:55.587
Counter Absorption!

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:02.385
[MAISE]
Why won't you die?! Ugh!

00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:06.014
[MAISE gasping]

00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:10.727
[MAISE screaming, groaning]

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:13.772
[RAY] That's the last
time you run away!

00:05:13.814 --> 00:05:16.358
We can make a deal!
What do you want?

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:19.361
I have 70 million lir
in my inventory!

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:23.615
Spare my life and it's yours!
You'll never have to work again!

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.994
I knew it! So it's
money you want.

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:28.870
[RAY]
No.

00:05:28.912 --> 00:05:30.288
What?

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.207
Your life is all I need.

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:34.209
[MAISE grunting]

[gasping]

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:44.678
The reverse effects on
my debuffs wore off.

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:46.763
Guess that means he's dead, huh?

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:49.891
[NEMESIS] Master! Do you have
potions for status ailments?

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:53.854
Some antidotes for poison,
but I never expected this many.

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:56.565
[NEMESIS growls]
Damn that centaur zombie!

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:59.526
Leaving us with this
lousy parting gift!

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:03.071
This should help you out.

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:05.824
Hugo? What is that?

00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:07.284
Just what he needs,

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:10.328
an Elixir and curse‐removing
High Spirit Water.

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:15.834
I guess I owe you one, Hugo.

00:06:15.876 --> 00:06:17.627
Just glad you're okay.

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:21.298
[RAY] Uh? That must be
the Lich's inventory.

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:22.716
You defeated him.

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:25.051
Like they say, to the
victor go the spoils.

00:06:25.093 --> 00:06:27.804
The thought of owning whatever
loot he had makes me sick.

00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:30.307
I completely share
those sentiments.

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:32.058
Now that there's no one
standing in our way,

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.478
I wanna start breaking those
kids out of the dungeon.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.856
Hey. Where's Cyco?

00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:40.150
It's time. Let's show them.

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:41.359
[CYCO]
Are you sure?

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:43.653
[HUGO]
Yeah, I trust them.

00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:53.705
Hey there, loli.

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:56.625
[NEMESIS] Then, you're a
Maiden type Embryo like me?

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:59.002
Yep. We're birds of a feather.

00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:00.670
Call me Cocytus.

00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:03.340
[RAY] What about the crest
that was on your hand?

00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:04.591
It was a Crest Disguise‐‐

00:07:04.633 --> 00:07:06.718
an ability exclusive
to Maiden types.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.596
I didn't realize a skill
like that existed.

00:07:09.638 --> 00:07:11.848
Ray, the kids are
waiting for us.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.183

back into the fortress.

doesn't pay off.

Those faces look familiar.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.806
It must've absorbed the

00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:18.183
Do we have a plan?

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:19.893

Maybe so.

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:55.655
[gasps]

00:10:57.824 --> 00:10:59.701
[GOUZ‐MAISE roars]

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:00.952
[RAY grunts]

00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:06.499
[RAY] Well, someone finally
got in the mood to fight.

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:08.793
[NEMESIS] If Gouz‐Maise was
created by the Lich's magic,

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:11.921
seeing his sworn enemy
must've enraged him.

00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:16.092
[RAY]
Just what we needed.

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:19.429
[NEMESIS] Maybe... I see a
glimmer of hope for us now.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:20.471
Then we can still win?

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:21.598
[NEMESIS]
You know how I told you

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:24.017
my accumulated damage
counter was acting strange?

00:11:24.058 --> 00:11:25.935
I figured out what was going on.

00:11:25.977 --> 00:11:26.769
Tell me.

00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:28.438
[NEMESIS] It's because we've
already collected more

00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:30.523
than enough damage.
In fact, it's the most

00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:32.692
we've ever absorbed
from a single creature.

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:33.985
Most likely,

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:37.530
it's from when the Lich released
his Deadly Mixer spell.

00:11:37.572 --> 00:11:39.324
But I thought the Lich
and Gouz‐Maise

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:41.743
were separate creatures. Uh!

00:11:41.784 --> 00:11:44.871
That thing's being
controlled by multiple grudges.

00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:47.248
[NEMESIS]
Yep. The damage we've collected

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:48.958
should be more than
enough to finish it.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.668
We just have to time
our attack right.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.129
[RAY] In other words, we wait
till the Lich's grudge takes

00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:55.465
control, then hit back
with Vengeance!

00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:58.509
[NEMESIS] There's a chance
we can defeat it.

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:01.846
All right, then I'll wager
everything on that possibility!

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:05.433
[GOUZ‐MAISE roars]

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:07.602
[NEMESIS] Revenant Ox‐Horse,
Gouz‐Maise!

00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:09.729
You've inflicted
suffering upon children

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:11.940
and have ended countless lives.

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:16.152
Even now, you continue
to endanger the living!

00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:19.239
[NEMESIS, RAY] For your crimes,
you will fall by our hand!

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:25.411
[GOUZ‐MAISE roaring]

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:26.246
[RAY grunts]

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:28.665
[NEMESIS] One more hit
and you're done for!

00:12:28.706 --> 00:12:30.208
[RAY]
Yeah, I know!

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:34.170
[groaning]

00:12:34.212 --> 00:12:36.297
Purgatorial Flames!

00:12:37.966 --> 00:12:40.635
[GOUZ‐MAISE roaring]

00:12:40.677 --> 00:12:42.512
If we don't locate the
core and attack soon,

00:12:42.553 --> 00:12:45.265
my stamina's gonna be depleted!

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:47.267
[NEMESIS] Our damage counter
disappeared, Master!

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:50.395
The Gouz half
must be in control!

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:51.396
Damn.

00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:54.274
He lost interest and wants to
chase after Hugo and the kids!

00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:55.358
[NEMESIS]
What now?

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.735
I've got an idea!

00:12:57.777 --> 00:12:59.862
Found it!

00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:01.030
Ha!

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:08.121
Not good!

00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:09.998
It's catching up
to the carriages!

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:12.208
I've got to try
and slow it down!

00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:19.090
[GOUZ‐MAISE groaning]

00:13:19.132 --> 00:13:21.718
Don't go and get
yourself killed, Ray.

00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:27.015
[RAY growling]

00:13:27.056 --> 00:13:28.558
[GOUZ‐MAISE groans]

00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:32.353
[RAY]
Come on!

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:35.732
[GOUZ‐MAISE grunting]

00:13:36.441 --> 00:13:37.900
[RAY yelps]

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:40.778
[NEMESIS]
The way it reacted just now.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:45.241
[RAY] I saw. We found
the weak point. The head.

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:47.327
I've got something of yours!

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:55.543
[GOUZ‐MAISE roars]

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:58.379
[NEMESIS] The Lich!
He's in control again!

00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:00.757
[RAY]
All right. Here's our chance!

00:14:03.926 --> 00:14:07.263
[RAY yells]

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:10.391
Fall! Damn you!

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:16.981
[GOUZ‐MAISE roaring]

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:17.982
[RAY grunts]

00:14:19.776 --> 00:14:23.071
All that's left is using
Vengeance is Mine on its‐‐

00:14:23.112 --> 00:14:23.946
The core!

00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:28.242
[GOUZ‐MAISE]
Deadly... Mixer!

00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:30.495
[RAY]
Counter Absorption!

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.459
[RAY]
That's gonna land!

00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:38.628
[NEMESIS]
I won't let you die!

00:14:40.505 --> 00:14:41.798
[gasps]

00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:45.385
Wake up!

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:49.097
This is bad.

00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:55.978
[NEMESIS] It's no use.
His wounds are too deep.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:59.273
[NEMESIS] I have to save him,
whatever it takes.

00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:06.072
[NEMESIS]
Forgive me.

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:17.625
[NEMESIS]
A small amount,

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:19.669
but at least he's not
on the verge of dying.

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:22.338
[GOUZ‐MAISE roaring]

00:15:23.506 --> 00:15:25.299
[NEMESIS]
After all the work we put in,

00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:27.260
getting so close to
saving the children,

00:15:27.301 --> 00:15:28.761
I won't let my Master‐‐

00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:31.681
I won't let Ray be killed
by that monster!

00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:35.518
We made a vow that evening, when
we lost to the Superior Killer.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.396
A vow to grow together
and seize victory.

00:15:38.438 --> 00:15:40.982
I know you're going
to wake up soon.

00:15:41.023 --> 00:15:45.528
And when you do, we'll
win this battle together.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.787
[NEMESIS]
I promise!

00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:58.332
[GOUZ‐MAISE growls]

00:16:05.673 --> 00:16:06.757
[RAY]
I remember.

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:09.886
This was during my brother's
fighting tournament way back‐‐

00:16:09.927 --> 00:16:11.179
[GARDRANDA]
Replay.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:15.141
Replay? So you're
the one doing this?

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:17.643
[tires screech, crash]

00:16:21.439 --> 00:16:25.234
[SHU] Aw, man. Don't need a
doctor to know that's broken.

00:16:25.276 --> 00:16:26.569
[REIJI]
I'm sorry.

00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:29.238
If only I hadn't jumped out.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.740
[SHU]
Reiji.

00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:33.284
You did exactly what
you should've done.

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:35.745
The world needs
more people like you.

00:16:35.786 --> 00:16:38.080
If I hadn't got in your way,
you'd be fine!

00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:40.124
Yeah, but I was able to save

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:42.710
that little girl's life
because of you.

00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:43.920
Right?

00:16:43.961 --> 00:16:45.630
Your choice to act saved her.

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:47.840
I just helped you out.

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:51.093
You can learn from choices,
but don't regret them.

00:16:51.135 --> 00:16:54.013
Making a solid choice,
that's always the first step

00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:56.265
to grabbing hold of
the future you want.

00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:57.767
Once you make a choice,

00:16:57.808 --> 00:16:59.894
what comes next depends on
whether you're able to see

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:02.688
the opportunity it brings
and grab onto that.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:04.273
[sniffs]

00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:07.777
And if you have the will,
the possibility is there.

00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:09.195
It may be small,

00:17:09.237 --> 00:17:12.657
there could be a whole bunch of
zeros past the radix point,

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:15.284
but even the smallest
amount is something.

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:18.412
There's only nothing if
you decide to give up,

00:17:18.454 --> 00:17:20.540
refuse to take a chance.

00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:22.708
As long as you never
throw in the towel,

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.336
make your own choices
and reach for the future,

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:29.507
the possibility's there, even if
it seems beyond the radix point.

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:31.175
[RAY] What my brother
told me that day

00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:34.470
left a huge impression on me.
I'll never forget it.

00:17:34.512 --> 00:17:35.846
[SHU]
And that's why...

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:40.017
Your choice to save that girl
was the right one. I'll be fine.

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:41.644
Thank you.

00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:44.772
And I'm gonna show you
exactly what I mean.

00:17:47.358 --> 00:17:50.861
[SHU] How to put your all into
grabbing hold of a possibility.

00:17:52.947 --> 00:17:54.615
[SHU]
You see Reiji?

00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:57.326
This is what I
was talking about!

00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:02.039
[CROWD cheers]

00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:05.585
[GARDRANDA] Your older
brother is very intense.

00:18:05.626 --> 00:18:06.669
[RAY]
You said it.

00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:11.299
[GARDRANDA] Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.466
Yep.

00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:16.304
Even if I'm in worse shape,
I know I can still beat it!

00:18:16.345 --> 00:18:20.433
[GARDRANDA] I see.
Then it's time to wake up.

00:18:20.474 --> 00:18:22.893
By the way,
who exactly are you?

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:27.148
[GARDRANDA] Heh. You'll never
have a real chance to master me

00:18:27.189 --> 00:18:29.233
if you only use my flames, Ray.

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:31.360
Hang on. Gardran‐‐?

00:18:31.402 --> 00:18:33.154
[GARDRANDA]
I'm just a fragment.

00:18:33.195 --> 00:18:37.450
A vestige of power left before
it could be fully realized.

00:18:37.491 --> 00:18:40.661
I am the life and mind
the ogre failed to produce.

00:18:40.703 --> 00:18:43.456
A life that's been
reborn as your item.

00:18:44.415 --> 00:18:46.626
[GARDRANDA]
And now, I understand you.

00:18:46.667 --> 00:18:49.170
I ask that you please
understand me.

00:18:49.211 --> 00:18:50.588
Work with Nemesis.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.758
Use my gifts, and give
everything you have to grab hold

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:55.801
of the opportunity before you.

00:18:55.843 --> 00:18:57.428
[GOUZ‐MAISE roars]

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:00.681
[NEMESIS]
Can't keep this up much longer.

00:19:00.723 --> 00:19:02.600
[GOUZ‐MAISE growling]

00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:05.728
[NEMESIS] You must be pretty
annoyed that you can't beat me!

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:09.440
[BANDITS]
Bleh.

00:19:10.858 --> 00:19:13.194
[NEMESIS] No way I can
dodge all of them.

00:19:14.445 --> 00:19:16.572
[NEMESIS]
I'm only so strong on my own.

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:20.368
I can't progress much further
without my master with me.

00:19:20.409 --> 00:19:23.996
So, you need to
come back right now!

00:19:24.038 --> 00:19:25.539
[RAY]
Okay!

00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:29.293
[GOUZ‐MAISE roars]

00:19:29.335 --> 00:19:32.755
[NEMESIS] Whoa, you really
took your time, Ray!

00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:34.006
My bad.

00:19:34.048 --> 00:19:36.884
Got stuck in a dream
and couldn't wake up.

00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:39.887
You know it's rude to keep
a lady waiting, right?

00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:42.390
[RAY]
Thanks a lot, really.

00:19:42.431 --> 00:19:47.186
I'm just glad you're back.
Now, about him.

00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:49.605
[RAY] I've got a plan.
But there's a catch.

00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:52.441
[NEMESIS] What?
It's practically impossible?

00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:55.569
[RAY]
Well, the possibility exists.

00:19:55.611 --> 00:19:58.447
So now it's up to us
to grab a hold of it!

00:19:58.489 --> 00:20:00.282
Then let's do it!

00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:03.285
Yeah, for the win!

00:20:03.327 --> 00:20:06.914
[GOUZ‐MAISE roars]

00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:14.255
[RAY]
Hellish Miasma! Full Blast!

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.679
[GOUZ‐MAISE roars]

00:20:23.681 --> 00:20:26.767
[GOUZ‐MAISE]
Deadly Mixer!

00:20:37.778 --> 00:20:40.114
I found out that if you get
a status ailment from

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:43.367
ingesting a part of a
debuffed opponent's body,

00:20:43.409 --> 00:20:44.827
it sends it back at 'em.

00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:47.872
Exactly like the "Flag Flying
the Reversal" move.

00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:49.623
I'm willing to bet
this is the first time

00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:51.584
you've been the one
to get eaten, huh?

00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:56.297
[GOUZ‐MAISE grunting, groans]

00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:08.100
[GOUZ‐MAISE]
Deadly... Mixer!

00:21:10.561 --> 00:21:12.855
[RAY]
Game over!

00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:15.649
[NEMESIS]
Beast consumed by immortality‐‐

00:21:15.691 --> 00:21:17.777
Now! Sleep for all eternity!

00:21:17.818 --> 00:21:19.320
[GOUZ‐MAISE grunts]

00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:22.907
[RAY]
Vengeance is Mine!

00:21:32.041 --> 00:21:34.960
[JABBERWOCK laughs]
He encountered and defeated

00:21:35.002 --> 00:21:39.048
two UBMs in as many
days. Fascinating.

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:43.761
[RAY] Grudge‐Soaked Greaves
Gouz‐Maise, huh?

00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:46.096
[NEMESIS] The skill "Rider and
Horse, As One" rewards you

00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:48.641
with the means to finally
be able to ride Silver.

00:21:48.682 --> 00:21:50.267
And it seems like
the other skill

00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:54.063
means I can turn grudge
energy into MP or SP.

00:21:57.358 --> 00:22:00.110
[NEMESIS] Are you thinking
about leaving this world?

00:22:00.152 --> 00:22:02.446
[RAY] This place is full of
violence and death.

00:22:02.488 --> 00:22:05.324
Was putting myself through this
kind of stuff a good idea?

00:22:05.366 --> 00:22:07.993
Honestly, I can't
really answer that.

00:22:08.035 --> 00:22:10.955
I mean, it hasn't all been bad.

00:22:10.996 --> 00:22:14.959
You realize you'll just face
more hardship if you stay here.

00:22:14.959 --> 00:22:18.587
If I see anything happen that
I know in my heart is wrong,

00:22:18.629 --> 00:22:21.173
I'll just stop it.

00:22:21.215 --> 00:22:24.051
I'll put my all into
grabbing that possibility.

00:22:24.093 --> 00:22:29.932
Okay. If you keep on fighting to
protect others, I'll do my part.

00:22:29.974 --> 00:22:32.184
And that means that
I'll protect you!

00:22:32.226 --> 00:22:33.435
[RAY grunts]

00:22:36.814 --> 00:22:39.984
[RAY]
Thanks, that means a lot.

00:22:45.114 --> 00:22:48.742
[FLAMINGO] Well, you two
sure have been busy, huh?

00:22:48.784 --> 00:22:50.786
To think you disposed
of those ruffians

00:22:50.828 --> 00:22:53.873
that were terrorizing this town.

00:22:53.914 --> 00:22:55.624
So you know about that?

00:22:55.666 --> 00:22:58.544
[FLAMINGO] Of course,
I've been wiretapping Ray.

00:22:58.586 --> 00:23:00.713
You wiretapped Ray?

00:23:00.754 --> 00:23:02.172
But how?

00:23:02.214 --> 00:23:04.800
[FLAMINGO]
That's a secret, dear boy.

00:23:04.842 --> 00:23:08.095
Well, if you know what he's
been up to, let me ask you‐‐

00:23:08.137 --> 00:23:12.057
[FLAMINGO] Yes, yes, he defeated
that nasty UBM all by himself.

00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:15.895
Oh, did he?
That's such great news.

00:23:15.936 --> 00:23:17.104
[HUGO]
But still.

00:23:17.146 --> 00:23:21.483
I know that he'll try to get in
the way and jeopardize our plan.

00:23:21.525 --> 00:23:23.485
[FLAMINGO] Don't worry
your chivalrous little head

00:23:23.527 --> 00:23:25.946
over this. If things
go as we want them to,

00:23:25.988 --> 00:23:28.365
the war will end with
only minimal casualties.

00:23:28.407 --> 00:23:31.452
A bold statement... you sure?

00:23:31.493 --> 00:23:33.203
[FLAMINGO]
His Excellency the General

00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:36.624
seeks nothing short
of an all‐ out war.

00:23:36.665 --> 00:23:38.751
But if we're going to do this,

00:23:38.792 --> 00:23:41.962
we must find a way that's
elegant, yet exhilarating.

00:23:42.004 --> 00:23:44.423
Tomorrow, we,
the Triangle of Wisdom,

00:23:44.465 --> 00:23:46.091
shall bring an end to the war

00:23:46.133 --> 00:23:48.093
between the imperium
and the kingdom.

00:23:48.135 --> 00:23:50.262
It will all be over!

00:23:52.473 --> 00:23:54.683
[RAY]
"The Dueling Cities."
