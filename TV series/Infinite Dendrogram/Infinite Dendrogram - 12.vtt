[NEMESIS gasps]

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.768
Ray!

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:21.188
[LILIANA grunts] Don't you die
on us! Using a Force Heal!

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.566
Anybody with extra MP
come over here!

00:00:24.608 --> 00:00:26.443
We have a downed Paladin
that needs help!

00:00:26.485 --> 00:00:28.070
The rest of you, follow me

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:30.364
and let's go save
Her Highness Elizabeth!

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:31.949
[KNIGHTS]
Yes, sir!

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.702
Restoring his HP's no
problem, but his arm....

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:38.830
It's so charred,
I won't be able to heal it.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:41.750
All that matters is
keeping him alive.

00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:44.711
I know Ray, and he doesn't
want to back out now.

00:00:46.088 --> 00:00:47.589
[ALL gasp]

00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:50.551
[FRANKLIN] Congratulations
are certainly in order!

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:54.054
You've made it 251 seconds
past the deadline, and look!

00:00:54.096 --> 00:00:56.807
Not one of my lovely creations
is wreaking havoc.

00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:58.475
Though, there were causalities.

00:00:58.517 --> 00:01:01.562
Sadly, my remote was
broken in the process.

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:03.564
Guess you won't get
the chance to see

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:05.983
my modded monstrosities.

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:08.485
[FRANKLIN chuckles]
As luck would have it,

00:01:08.527 --> 00:01:11.405
I just happen to have
a spare remote.

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:12.739
After all that.

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:14.908
One can never be too
prepared in a world

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.785
of infinite possibilities.

00:01:16.827 --> 00:01:20.247
And did I mention, this one
doesn't have a timer built in?

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:22.416
All it takes is a little push!

00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:24.209
Push, push, push...

00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:25.544
We defeated you!

00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:29.256
[FRANKLIN laughing]
Don't get me wrong,

00:01:29.298 --> 00:01:31.091
the battle had me on
the edge of my seat.

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:33.885
But the ending needed
a major rewrite!

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:35.345
[NEMESIS growls]

00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:38.348
I want you to take over
treating Ray, understood?

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.435
[FRANKLIN] What do we have here?
Despite her injuries,

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:44.521
Miss Vice‐Captain's off to
protect the city and its people.

00:01:44.563 --> 00:01:47.441
Or maybe she's aiming
to try and take me down?

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:51.028
Man. How selfless of you!
We can't have that.

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:56.199
Call: DGP and KOS!

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:05.751
How many does he have?

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.753
[FRANKLIN] I didn't have
the heart to tell RSK,

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:10.714
but he was my weakest
pawn on the board.

00:02:10.756 --> 00:02:12.174
These sugar dumplings
on the other hand

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:14.968
have the battle strength
of a Legendary UBM.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.097
The Ray Starling Killer was
more about poetic justice.

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.265
Seeing as how he took down

00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:22.392
my Demi‐Drag Worms
back in the Orchard,

00:02:22.434 --> 00:02:24.603
I figured it would only
be appropriate to design

00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:28.190
a higher‐tiered beastie of the
same type to break his spirit.

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:31.693
But, sigh, he managed
to end up beating me.

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:32.778
Again.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.947
Which means the current
score is me zero, Ray two.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.115
And don't think for an instant

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.618
I won't get back at him
for this humiliation.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.455
Regardless, I have no intention
of losing a second time tonight.

00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:45.082
[NEMESIS growls]

00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:49.544
Now, let's get a good look
at Gideon's demise.

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:53.465
What gives? There should
be chaos in the streets.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:57.803
The remote seems to be
functioning properly.

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:01.473
Which means there must be
some issue with the devices.

00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:06.687
But you'd need major Conceal
skills in order to find them.

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:09.523
So, she's still kicking.

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:13.110
[MARIE sighs] I do love
a good treasure hunt.

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:16.446
Franklin must not know my
Conceal Sense is top‐notch.

00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:18.824
You can't get anything past me.

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:21.660
[FRANKLIN]
Oh‐ho! Now isn't that funny.

00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:24.413
Everyone's so intent
on ruining my plans.

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:26.915
It's getting to be a
little disheartening.

00:03:26.957 --> 00:03:28.250
So, the plot's failed.

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:30.711
[ROOK]
No. Not yet, at least.

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:32.087
Meaning?

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.715
Franklin won't
give up so easily.

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:37.718
Like he said,
both the A and B plan failed.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.469
He's out of options.

00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:41.847
Don't tell me you
sincerely believe that.

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:45.225
I do. We wanted to limit
the tian causalities.

00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:47.477
He promised me that he would.

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:53.900
[sighs] You can't see Franklin
for what he is. I pity you.

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:56.236
I may be idealistic,
but I am not blind.

00:03:56.278 --> 00:03:58.488
Well, from where I stand,

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.866
the man's perfectly
capable of slaughter.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:03.493
[HUGO] You're wrong!
We're the same.

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:06.079
He understands tians
aren't just NPCs!

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:08.623
Both of us see them as living,
breathing beings!

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:10.709
Is that going to stop him
from killing them?

00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:13.211
Didn't you hear
a word I just said?

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:17.799
He won't! He swore.
I've known him for a long time.

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:20.427
Just what do you know
about him, anyway?

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:22.345
Honestly, not much.

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:24.139
The extent of my
knowledge is based on

00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:26.308
what I've heard
and tonight's incident.

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.895
Never once spoken with
him directly. And yet,

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:32.856
I can say with confidence
my assumptions are correct.

00:04:32.898 --> 00:04:33.857
[HUGO]
How?

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:35.358
Because Hugo, unlike you,

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.819
I don't know him on
a personal level.

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:40.530
Everything I've been witness
to firsthand so far,

00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:44.576
tells me he's got something even
more sinister up his sleeve.

00:04:44.618 --> 00:04:48.079
Any sane person would
draw the same conclusion.

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:51.124
The fact is, you're probably
the only one who hasn't.

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:52.584
[gasps]

00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:55.337
[ROOK] You trust him with
all your heart, right?

00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:58.673
Then allow me to hit you
with a logical deduction.

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:00.300
I'm listening.

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:04.679
Any minute now, Franklin's going
to announce something vile.

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.641
I probably shouldn't
say this out loud,

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:09.851
but there's nothing keeping
those scary meatheads

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:12.437
from leaving the arena
and coming here.

00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:13.980
So this is your fault.

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:17.609
You forced me to
carry out Plan C.

00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:18.735
[gasps]

00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:20.904
The "C" stands for "Crisis."

00:05:20.946 --> 00:05:23.198
I'm talking the complete
annihilation of Gideon

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.367
at the hands of my
modded monsters.

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:28.745
All 56,826 of 'em.

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:06.134
[NEMESIS] Did he just say he has
over 56,000 modded monsters?

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:09.137
If only you had taken the
hint sooner and given up!

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:12.015
Then I would've destroyed you
in a more humane fashion.

00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:14.851
He's going to summon
beasts using his Jewel!

00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:16.770
Cut him down before
he gets the chance!

00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:18.480
Please, how inefficient!

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.857
Imagine bringing
them out individually.

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:23.818
I wouldn't reach ten thousand
before daybreak!

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.821
Optical Disguise: cancel!

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:35.497
What's that?

00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:36.456
[NEMESIS gasps]

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:54.432
[FRANKLIN] May I present
my Superior Embryo.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:08:00.522
Type. Plant Fortress: Magic
Beast Factory, Pandemonium!

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:02.774
[gasping]

00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:10.031
[FRANKLIN] Now then, what do you
say we start things off small?

00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:13.326
Maybe 5,000 from
my Suicide Series?

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:26.339
[CREATURES roaring]

00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:33.680
[FRANKLIN] Man, it feels good
to just let it all out.

00:08:33.722 --> 00:08:35.390
We still have a shot at this!

00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:37.100
They'll stop after
Franklin's killed!

00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:40.061
[FRANKLIN]
Yeah. That's a no‐go. Sorry.

00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:43.273
Death's the only thing that'll
make them pump the brakes.

00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:46.026
Matter of fact, even I've got
no way of stopping them!

00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:49.195
But I don't understand.
Aren't they your monsters?

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:52.115
[FRANKLIN] Sure are. I made
them using Pandemonium,

00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:53.616
but you know what
they say about art:

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:56.745
once you release it into the
world, it's no longer yours.

00:08:56.786 --> 00:09:00.081
And that release felt
so damn good!

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:02.625
Release? What are
you talking about?

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:04.335
[FRANKLIN]
Heh. Come now.

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:06.921
Haven't you heard of a little
thing called minion capacity?

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:09.132
Don't gimme so much credit.
I'm a superior.

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:11.676
But not even I could
oversee 5,000.

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:14.637
And no need to worry.
They won't come near me.

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:17.932
Each one was properly programmed
before being set loose.

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:20.602
These beauties will keep
marching forward till they die,

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:22.729
like a pack of
homicidal lemmings.

00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:24.105
Slaughtering everything
in their path,

00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:28.276
save for my clan members and any
of my other lovely creations.

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:29.527
Impressive?

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:32.489
As you can see, they live up
to the Suicide Series brand!

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.866
<i>Tu as compris?</i>

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:37.494
[NEMESIS] We're outnumbered.
There's no way we can take on

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:40.371
that many of Franklin's
monstrosities!

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.540
Fight back,
but it's kinda too late.

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:43.625

Right!

[FRANKLIN laughing]
You're making me tear up!

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:13.029
Kid, the smart move would've
been to stay unconscious.

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:16.032
In case it's not clear to you,
the battle's over!

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:20.787
[RAY] Not yet. My fight's
far from being over!

00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:21.955
I won't stop.

00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:25.291
Even if I can't stand up
or swing my blade.

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:28.920
As long as I'm faced with
injustice, I will never yield!

00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:34.175
[RAY] Liliana, you and your
soldiers handle Pandemonium!

[gasps]

00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:03.204
Watch out!

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:04.873
[LION B roaring]

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:13.590
[WOMAN] Looks like you
could use some help.

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:15.300
The numbers are on their side.

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:18.720
So it only makes sense
for us to cooperate for now.

00:11:18.761 --> 00:11:21.055
You said it. Thanks for
the help, Marie.

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:22.515
What name did you just call me?

00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:24.225
[PANTHER A roars]

00:11:28.062 --> 00:11:29.898
[MARIE]
How long have you known?

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:32.317
[RAY] I couldn't tell
when we first met,

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:34.819
but now, I'm able to make
you out through the mist.

00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:37.197
[MARIE]
Yeah. It's me.

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:40.617
[MARIE] And here I was
trying to hide my identity

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:44.037
with Voice Change. Man,
do I feel like an idiot.

00:11:44.078 --> 00:11:46.915
[NEMESIS] All this time, Marie
was the Superior Killer.

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:50.043
[MARIE] Short answer, yeah, but
let's save the longer discussion

00:11:50.084 --> 00:11:51.502
for another time.

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:54.505
Sure thing, but you owe me
a duel when this is over!

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:57.508
[MARIE] You name the place, just
don't expect me to hold back.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:58.343
[RAY grunts]

00:11:58.384 --> 00:12:00.386
Ha! There's only two of you!

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:03.097
Stop acting as if you've got
a chance. You really think

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:06.434
you have what it takes to
hold back 5,000 monsters?

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:08.645
Like hell you do!

00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:11.105
Then we'll just have to
stop them with 20!

00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:13.149
[RAY grunts]
Rook, You made it!

00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:15.610
Naturally! Um...

00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:19.530
I don't believe you and I have
met. Hey, McBlackmist!

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:22.492
McBlackmist?
Don't you recognize me?

00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:28.456
[FRANKLIN]
They can't win.

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:31.584
It's an army versus
a handful of newbs.

00:12:31.626 --> 00:12:35.630
Plus some high‐rank Masters,
who ought to be Frozen solid.

00:12:35.672 --> 00:12:38.758
Speaking of, even if Yu
ate the penalty for dying,

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.886
La Porte de l'Enfer should
stay active for an hour.

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:43.096
Unless...

00:12:43.137 --> 00:12:46.808
Don't tell me you canceled it.

00:12:46.849 --> 00:12:50.478
Though, I guess I betrayed
you first, sister.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.980
Like it even matters.

00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:55.275
Combining forces still only
leaves you with 22!

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:56.734
But if you think
you're strong enough

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:59.237
to take on this surge
of magical beasts,

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:01.572
by all means, prove me wrong!

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:07.954
We have to break through
the barrier, now!

00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:09.122
[MASTERS grunt]

00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:25.930
I'll leave this to you. If
the one down below or the two

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:29.225
in the stands try making a move,
you know the drill.

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:32.687
Where are you headed
off to now?

00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:36.566
[SHU] To seize the possibility
that my brother's given us.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.113
Their spirits still
haven't broken.

00:13:43.281 --> 00:13:47.910
[FRANKLIN] Well, then.
Well, well, well, well.

00:13:49.912 --> 00:13:52.457
[FRANKLIN] Some people need it
spelled out for them.

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:58.046
You've overstayed
your welcome, newbie!

00:13:58.087 --> 00:14:00.631
Do I have to kill you myself?

00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:03.259

Bounced right off!

00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:31.204
It must be part Dragon King

00:14:31.245 --> 00:14:34.248
since it's using the
same kind of Aura!

00:14:55.686 --> 00:14:59.524
I know. This is probably
my last stand.

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:02.693
But I'm not about to
go down without a fight.

00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:05.071
Be ready the second that
thing attacks, Nemesis.

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:07.073

counter in its face!

[SHU]
I'm all in for taking risks,

00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:31.597
but I'd recommend saving this
one for another day.

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:34.100
Those counters should only
be used in situations

00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:37.311
where you can kill
the enemy and survive.

00:15:37.353 --> 00:15:39.188
Dying while the
other guy escapes?

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.399
That's not what
I call a fair trade.

You can do much better, grizz.

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:46.529

for you, Franklin.

Can't wait to hear this.

00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:28.988
[SHU] For someone with
the foresight to have two

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:32.450
backup plans, you made a
colossal mistake tonight.

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:34.243
You should never
have antagonized

00:16:34.285 --> 00:16:36.245
my little brother and me.

00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:39.665
Now that my wrath's awakened,

00:16:39.707 --> 00:16:41.876
the King of Destruction
will live up to his title,

00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:44.253
and destroy all
of your creations!

[CREATURES roar]

00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:57.558
[FRANKLIN]
Are you serious?

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.145
Those are Superior‐equivalent
Demi‐Dragon‐class monsters,

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:02.897
and this clown is just
punching through them like

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:04.482
wet paper bags.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.238
[FRANKLIN]
Well, this is garbage.

00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:12.823
It's bad enough the King of
Destruction's job level

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:14.325
is at one thousand eighty.

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:16.994
But over a hundred
thousand strength?

00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:19.872
Based on that stat alone,
he might just be the most

00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:23.793
powerful Master in Dendrogram,
as well as the most imbalanced.

00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:25.253
That's all he invested in.

00:17:25.294 --> 00:17:27.880
His agility's barely
cracking four digits.

00:17:27.922 --> 00:17:30.049
But something's off.

00:17:30.091 --> 00:17:32.426
If he hasn't upgraded his speed,

00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:34.345
how are monsters that
are faster than him

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:38.349
not even managing
to land a single blow?

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:40.434
Seems his IRL
martial arts skills

00:17:40.476 --> 00:17:42.520
give him an in‐game boost.

00:17:43.604 --> 00:17:45.731
[FIGARO] "If your foe
is ten times faster,

00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:47.692
just read ten moves ahead."

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:49.360
[XUNYU]
What's that supposed to mean?

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:51.946
[FIGARO] Simple, he's predicting
the enemy's actions,

00:17:51.988 --> 00:17:54.865
then selecting his attacks
based on their trajectory,

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:57.868
striking weak points
they're unable to defend.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:02.123
[XUNYU] Earlier in the lobby, he
managed to deflect my attack.

00:18:02.164 --> 00:18:04.166
But reading ten moves ahead?

00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:08.129
Give me a break.
Who can even do that?

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:09.672
[FIGARO]
You're looking at him.

00:18:09.714 --> 00:18:12.717
He dabbled in martial
arts back in the day.

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:16.554
[XUNYU] Martial arts, huh?
Certainly shows.

00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:20.224
Hold up a sec. What happened
to his bear costume?

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:22.893
Better yet, what's with
his new get up?

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:24.937
[FIGARO]
That's the Mythical Godcloth.

00:18:24.979 --> 00:18:27.356
A convertible piece of gear.

00:18:28.399 --> 00:18:29.984
[XUNYU]
Since you know everything...

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:31.485
[FIGARO]
Go on.

00:18:31.527 --> 00:18:33.863
[XUNYU] When do you suppose
the loser in the lab coat's

00:18:33.904 --> 00:18:36.282
gonna trigger the
thing under us?

00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:38.743
[FIGARO] I'm willing to bet it's
a tactical self‐destruct

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:43.039
monster. I.e, he'll use it
after his Plan C fails.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.416
Basically, any minute now.

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:47.209
[XUNYU]
Whatever's waiting for us,

00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:49.712
I'll take it out with
my ultimate skill.

00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:51.547
Which leaves you the other job.

00:18:51.589 --> 00:18:53.382
[FIGARO]
Those two are less predictable.

00:18:53.424 --> 00:18:55.593
But as soon as either one of
them goes on the offensive,

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:56.761
so will I.

00:18:56.802 --> 00:19:00.806
[XUNYU laughs]
They won't be easy to defeat.

00:19:00.848 --> 00:19:03.059
[FIGARO]
Yeah, but it's gonna be fun.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:06.020
[XUNYU]
Can't argue with that.

00:19:06.062 --> 00:19:07.063
[LEVIATHAN]
Amazing.

00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:09.523
He's using some tricks,
but for the most part,

00:19:09.565 --> 00:19:11.442
it's pure brute strength.

00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:13.444
What a feeling to be hit by him.

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:16.364
Or better yet, getting the
chance to hit him back.

00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:17.573
[laughs]

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:19.909
[BEHEMOTH]
He's like some kind of hero.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.494
[gasps]

00:19:21.535 --> 00:19:23.079
[LEVIATHAN]
Absolutely.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.955
[BEHEMOTH]
I wonder who's more powerful,

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:28.250
him or the Queen of Monsters?

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:32.213
[LEVIATHAN]
We're going to find out.

00:19:46.394 --> 00:19:48.646
[FRANKLIN] I've poured over the
King of Destruction's skills

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:50.106
and stats, studying them,

00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:52.566
and even though I was
surprised by what I found,

00:19:52.608 --> 00:19:54.860
the end result'll be the same.

00:19:54.902 --> 00:19:57.154
What good is all that
power and grit?

00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:59.407
In the end, the numbers
are on my side.

00:19:59.448 --> 00:20:03.494
I have 50,000 Suicide Series
monsters at my disposal,

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:06.288
ready to swarm every
district of Gideon.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:09.792
The city may be able to handle
a focused attack at one gate,

00:20:09.834 --> 00:20:12.795
but with monsters invading from
every conceivable direction,

00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:14.338
they'll be overrun.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.173
Inevitably, some
percentage of the horde

00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:19.218
will make it past the walls.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.930
March onward! And let
the fall of Gideon be‐‐

00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:27.768
What the...? Artillery?

00:20:39.613 --> 00:20:41.991
[FRANKLIN]
It's a damn battleship!

00:20:42.032 --> 00:20:44.702
[BALDR]
Twin Quintuple Cannons.

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:49.290
Firebombs loaded.
Barrage unleashed!

00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:54.128
[BALDR]
Stardust Genocider.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.178
[BALDR]
Bloody Laser Storm.

00:21:09.393 --> 00:21:15.065
Just who invited you?
A wide‐scale extermination type?

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:29.997
[FRANKLIN]
Game over then? Huh.

00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:33.834
Plan A was foiled.
Courtesy of Ray Starling.

00:21:33.876 --> 00:21:37.129
Plan B, thanks to
the Superior Killer.

00:21:37.171 --> 00:21:38.380
But worst of all...

00:21:38.422 --> 00:21:41.091
Plan C, the most
elaborate of the bunch,

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:45.304
was pulverized to ash by
the King of Destruction.

00:21:45.346 --> 00:21:46.430
What a joke.

00:21:46.472 --> 00:21:49.433
I spend hours crafting three
different foolproof schemes,

00:21:49.475 --> 00:21:52.603
only for them to whip out
bigger guns every time.

00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:55.648
You know, ya can't help
but laugh out loud.

00:21:58.651 --> 00:21:59.985
Enough of this farce.

00:22:00.027 --> 00:22:05.366
I know how this is going to end,
and it's not with me winning.

00:22:05.407 --> 00:22:06.617
Very well.

00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:11.163
I'll just delete their victory,
and by extension, my defeat.

00:23:52.473 --> 00:23:54.975
