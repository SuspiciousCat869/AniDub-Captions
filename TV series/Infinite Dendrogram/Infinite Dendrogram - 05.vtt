00:00:10.052 --> 00:00:11.512
[RAY]
U‐Uh...

00:00:11.553 --> 00:00:13.013
[gasping]

00:00:13.055 --> 00:00:16.391
This moment must
be immortalized!

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:19.394
[NEMESIS gasps] She captured
your essence perfectly!

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:22.064
[MARIE] I have to know where
you get those magnificent ears.

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:23.732
A quest? A shop?

00:00:23.774 --> 00:00:25.192
From a penguin.

00:00:29.988 --> 00:00:31.949
No, an evil penguin.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.952
Well, one thing's obvious‐‐
that bird has style.

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:38.372
I was planning on visiting
Alejandro's store later today.

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:40.249
Guess that's not happening.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.460
Don't let it get into your head,
but in all seriousness‐‐

00:00:43.502 --> 00:00:44.711
you're not gonna stand out.

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:48.924
It's not the least bit unusual
for Masters to grow animal ears.

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.467
Look what the wind blew in!

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:54.137
I'm so glad you decided to pay
us a visit! Welcome, Ray!

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.140
Hey, Alejandro. What a store!

00:00:57.182 --> 00:00:58.725
[RAY]
I guess Marie was right.

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:00.936
There was no point
being self‐conscious.

00:01:00.978 --> 00:01:03.564
I just hope I don't run
into Rook and Babylon.

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:05.440
[BABYLON]
Cute headband!

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:08.777
Morning Ray! Hey, Nemesis!
Weird running into you here!

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:11.321
[RAY] These stupid ears
must be cursed.

00:01:11.363 --> 00:01:13.073
Maybe the Miasmaflame Bracers

00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:14.741
had some kind of
hex put on them.

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:17.869
I must know, where did you
get those beautiful ears?

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:20.122
Penguins, potions, yadda
yadda, you know the rest.

00:01:20.163 --> 00:01:21.456
That's hardly an explanation.

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:24.209
[ROOK] I understand, you were
approached by a mysterious

00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:26.461
stranger who tricked you
into drinking an elixir.

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:28.463
[BOTH]
How'd you figure that out?

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:30.215
[RAY] Maybe he's psychic
or something?

00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:31.967
Just your basic mindreading.

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.344
It's really simple once
you get the hang of it.

00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:38.307
[NEMESIS] Basic? Simple?
Crush my ego why dontcha?

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:42.519
By the way, Rook, that's
a snazzy looking coat.

00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:43.437
I'm into it.

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:47.316
Thanks! I've really taken
a liking to Liz, too.

00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:52.404
Did it just move?

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:59.244
This one's calling to me!

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:03.999
[RAY] After seeing Rook's coat,
I decided to get one of my own

00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:06.960
You don't have any independent
thoughts in your head, do you?

00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:10.714
Jeez, could you not read
my mind all the time? Huh?

00:02:10.756 --> 00:02:11.632
[CROWD murmuring]

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:13.550
[NEMESIS]
What're they in line for?

00:02:17.763 --> 00:02:19.014
[RAY]
A gacha machine.

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:54.317
[RAY]
This looks like a perfect spot.

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.279
[NEMESIS] Too bad is doesn't
come with 200,000 lir.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.113
[RAY growls]

00:03:58.155 --> 00:04:00.323
Then you woulda broke even.

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:03.118
That's the second time you've
spent 100,000 on gacha.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.078
And the first was at the Tomb
Labyrinth for that worthless‐‐

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.332
Don't remind me! You're
giving me flashbacks!

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:13.378
Rook struck big. Some people
have all the luck.

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:17.883
[RAY]
Loads of capsules in that thing

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:20.594
and he wins special UBM armor.

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:22.929
What if... I'm cursed?

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:24.723
[RAY] The staff said they've
never even seen

00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:25.849
an X‐rank capsule!

00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:26.975
[RAY grunts]

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:35.108
[RAY]
Whoa!

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.696
[RAY]
Zephyrus Silver.

00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:43.283
Looks like it's a type
of riding equipment.

00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:47.329
[NEMESIS] It won't do you
much good from down here.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.538
[RAY]
Hup!

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:52.667
Wow!

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:54.294
Try not to fall off!

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:57.798
Duh! Hi‐ho, Silver!

00:04:58.298 --> 00:04:59.382
[RAY grunts]

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:02.052
[NEMESIS]
Boop, boop.

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:03.345
[RAY]
I'm still alive.

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:04.888
Good thing the ground
broke your fall.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.223
‐‐Boop. Boop. Boop.
‐‐[RAY] Stop that!

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:09.059
Seeing as your job is a
Paladin, I would figure that

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.145
riding a horse would be
second nature to you.

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:14.272
Yeah, that's what I thought.

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:17.192
But I don't have the
ability to ride yet.

00:05:17.234 --> 00:05:18.485
I don't understand why,

00:05:18.527 --> 00:05:20.278
since you're basically
an upgraded knight.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.947
Seems like a skill
you would know.

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:23.782
A knight. Wait.

00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:24.825
[gasps]

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:28.203
I've got to go look something
up. I'll be back in a second.

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:33.875
Okay. Since I skipped
over being a knight,

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:37.295
I missed out on riding
and other basic skills.

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:39.881
But something called the
Amulet of the Equestrian Tribe

00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:41.216
oughtta let me learn how.

00:05:41.258 --> 00:05:43.301
Luckily it's an item
that can be purchased.

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.804
Wonder how much
that'll cost me.

00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:49.099
A hundred Gs! Mm...

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.230
[RAY] I've gotta find a way
to start earning serious lir.

00:05:55.272 --> 00:05:57.858
What about going to the arena?
You can fight without

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:01.236
worrying about dying,
and there's prize money.

00:06:01.278 --> 00:06:03.613
Yeah, I would, but
the only problem is

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:06.867
you have to be at least
level 51 to participate.

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:09.369
I know! I'll place
bets on the fights!

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:10.579
Gambling, huh?

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.622
Remind me again how we
ended up near broke.

00:06:12.664 --> 00:06:15.166
Yeah, yeah. You're not wrong.

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:16.710
[REBECCA]
I did what you asked!

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:19.462
[BANDIT A grunts]
So you brought the money.

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:21.381
I managed to scrape
enough together!

00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:23.216
Now please, give me
back my brother!

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:25.719
Man. You're dumber
than I thought.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.804
That's the boss's
dinner you know?

00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:30.473
And you... you're
gonna be our dinner!

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:33.476
These are the most generic
scumbags I've ever seen.

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:34.853
What do we do?

00:06:34.895 --> 00:06:38.773
You don't even need to read
my mind to know the answer.

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:41.067
‐‐Stop right there!
‐‐[HUGO] Stop right there!

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:43.194
[RAY] These things
make my voice echo?

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:47.282
[HUGO] Vile rapscallions!
I'll tell you only once.

00:06:47.324 --> 00:06:49.326
Unhand the gentle
lady you fiends!

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:51.077
Sir, you have to help me!

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:53.622
Ha. But of course.

00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:56.166
Even the fairest
flowers have thorns,

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:58.293
and when scoundrels
threaten ladies...

00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:02.547
That's when I appear.
The rose's thorn!

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:03.882

00:07:03.924 --> 00:07:05.508
Who in the hell are you?

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.553
All you need to know
is my level is 126.

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:10.013
What? You're lying!

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:13.391
Very well. A display then.

‐‐[BANDIT D] Take him down!

get out my Magingear!

Thank you for all your help!

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:29.032
Huh? How did...?

00:07:29.074 --> 00:07:32.369
I thought this guy said his
level was over a hundred!

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.537
Who's up next?

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:36.289
You shoulda kept walking!

Um. That's cool.

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:49.636
Nemesis, was that you?

00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:51.721
Don't look at me.

00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:54.516
That's right! I forgot

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:58.436
the Miasmaflame Bracers also
boost my strength stat by 100%!

00:07:58.478 --> 00:07:59.354
Oh, crap.

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:03.984

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:04.818
Now then...

Which of you is next?

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:12.409
You'll pay! Her little

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:22.919
Thanks to you.

00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:23.878

What about 'em?

00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:29.092
Nothing. I like your style.

00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:32.053
If you want your own pair,
be on the lookout for a penguin.

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:34.806
Heh. I'll keep that in mind.

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:38.768
Hugo Lesseps, Master

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.687
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:44.232
You can call me Ray Starling.
Master and Paladin.

00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:46.943
And by my side is
my Embryo, Nemesis.

00:08:46.985 --> 00:08:50.238
I see. It's a rare occasion
to meet a Maiden type.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.616
If I may say, and rarer to
find one as beautiful.

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:54.617
Yeah.

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:56.745
Sorry, but with a level
as high as yours,

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:59.122
how did those jerks get
the better of you?

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:01.166
A quirk of my job, I'm afraid.

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:03.334
My physical stats
don't increase by much,

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:06.046
but it's worth the trade.
Trust me!

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:09.632
[REBECCA]
Uh. Um, excuse me.

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:12.135
I wanted to thank you
again for what you did.

00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:14.888
There's no need. I couldn't
stand by doing nothing.

00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:16.556
[REBECCA] Forgive me,
but I've a favor ask

00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:19.142
seeing how the two of you
are Masters. Save him.

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:22.145
I beg you, please save
my younger brother!

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:24.814
Miss, there's no
need to bow to us.

00:09:24.856 --> 00:09:27.942
Save him from the bandits
we fought earlier?

00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:31.071
They took him. The Gouz‐Maise
Gang kidnaps children.

00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:33.531
The worst part is if the ransom
they demand isn't paid,

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:37.077
the poor kids are murdered,
then... eaten.

00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:39.204
[gasps]

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:40.538
You have to stop them!

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.166
If you save my brother,
then all this money is yours!

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:46.044
It's not much,
but I can get more!

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:49.130
I'll do it for free. You don't
have to worry about a thing.

00:09:49.172 --> 00:09:50.799
You on board, Hugo?

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.801
Yes. Naturally.

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:56.221
I'm in your debt.
Thank you, sirs.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:59.307
[HUGO] Milady. Allow me
to wipe your tears.

00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:01.184
There's no need for them.

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:05.480
When the sun rises tomorrow,
you will greet the day smiling.

00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:07.857
This I swear to you.

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:19.911
[HUGO grunts]

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.049
[CYCO]
Sorry for the wait, Hugo.

00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:35.718
[RAY]
She took them all down.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.011
Huh?

00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:38.346
[RAY]
She has a crest.

00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:40.723
Whoever this girl is,
she's a Master, too.

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:43.017
Way to manage the threat, Cyco.

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:46.437
[CYCO] If they were a threat,
I'd be flattered.

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:52.277
I interrogated them and found
out where they're holing up.

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:55.947
The rest of their gang is over
at the Cruella Mountain Belt.

00:10:58.241 --> 00:10:59.826
[CYCO]
So the chivalrous Hugo

00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:01.911
has befriended a
loli and her lover?

00:11:01.953 --> 00:11:03.913
[BOTH]
Loli‐lover?

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:06.875
Short, flat‐chested.
Deny it all you want,

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:08.960
but you have all the
hallmarks of a Loli.

00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:12.005
And as far as dog boy goes,
why else would she

00:11:12.046 --> 00:11:14.549
be serving you if you
weren't loli‐obsessed.

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:16.593
Oh, what do you know? Just FYI,

00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:20.180
my form and design are based on
universal beauty, not a fetish!

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:22.599
[CYCO] If a Master of an
Embryo views those traits as

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.186
universal beauty, they're
obviously a Loli‐lover.

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:27.687
Could you stop saying that?!

00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:29.772
That's it!
Experience my wrath!

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:30.899
Bring it on.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.066
[BOTH grunting]

00:11:34.402 --> 00:11:37.572
[RAY] Ah. So who's the
monotone girl in the fur hat?

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:41.284
Cyco. She's my...

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:42.952
She's a party member.

00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:45.455
Her tongue's sharp,
but she's reliable.

00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:49.959
[RAY]
Wait. What did we miss?

00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:55.924
[NAVIGATOR] Quest activated.
Rescue Roddy Lancarse.

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:58.426
Difficulty level eight.

00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:02.096
Well, Ray. Ready?
Our mission awaits!

00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:06.267
You know it! Right!
Let's go save her brother!

00:12:12.523 --> 00:12:14.651
[HUGO]
This spot will do fine.

00:12:14.692 --> 00:12:15.777
[HUGO grunts]

00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:21.616
What is this?

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:27.330
Machinery?

00:12:27.372 --> 00:12:28.373
[gasps]

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:30.541
Hugo, are you a...

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:33.378
[HUGO] Ray, what's the reason
you agreed to this quest?

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:35.588
Is it because you're a
Paladin of the Kingdom?

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.633
Or because you're a man
who lives by his own code?

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:41.678
I agreed because letting the kid
die wouldn't sit well with me.

00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:44.555
Position never entered into it.

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.599
[HUGO]
Exactly how I feel.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:05.076
[HUGO] Magingear, the main
weapon of the Dryfe Imperium.

00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:06.953
A mecha...

00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:08.246
I'm a humble knight.

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:11.916
When a lady asks that I
fight for her, I fight.

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.419
That's our way, isn't it,
my brother‐in‐arms?

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.045
Yeah.

00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:21.968
Demi‐Dragon‐rank
Magingear, Marshal II!

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.511
Forward!

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.812
[NEMESIS] Should we rush
the place all at once?

00:13:32.854 --> 00:13:35.773
[RAY] They might start executing
hostages if we do.

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:37.692
[HUGO]
I may have a suggestion.

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:38.568
Let's hear it then.

00:13:38.609 --> 00:13:41.237
[HUGO] Like I said earlier,
this is Dryfe weaponry.

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:43.489
It pains me to say but
my nation has no reason

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:45.950
to save the Kingdom's children.

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:47.577
[RAY]
I think I follow you.

00:13:47.618 --> 00:13:49.078
[HUGO]
If I attacked the fort alone,

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.331
I doubt they'd use
the children against me.

00:13:51.372 --> 00:13:54.292
It'd be a waste of hostages
on a foe with zero interest.

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:55.793
And they'd be losing money.

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:59.797
Plus, I can lure all of them
out after they counter‐attack.

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:02.884
That's when you sneak into
the fort and rescue everyone.

00:14:02.925 --> 00:14:04.302
Count on me.

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:05.970
[HUGO] I'll use my
Smoke Discharger to cloud

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:09.349
their vision. You'll be able to
move within the smoke fine.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:11.267
Cyco, use Enemy Detect.

00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:13.728
<i>Oui.</i> Ma... m'sieur.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.356
[HUGO] Remember, this hinges
on speed and precision.

00:14:16.397 --> 00:14:21.819
When children's lives are at
stake, failure is not an option.

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:23.071
One more thing.

00:14:23.112 --> 00:14:25.406
You're a Maiden Master
like me, aren't you?

00:14:25.448 --> 00:14:26.991
[RAY]
Why do you ask?

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:28.368
[HUGO]
It may sound strange,

00:14:28.409 --> 00:14:30.620
but Masters with our type
have something in common.

00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:32.246
And what's that?

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:35.875
According to a friend of mine,
we're not like the rest.

00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:39.379
Infinite Dendrogram's a game
to them, but for us it's real.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.006
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course I know it's a game!

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:44.008
[HUGO] My acquaintance
said the same thing.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:47.387
However, deep inside, I knew
they didn't believe it.

00:14:47.428 --> 00:14:48.346
Which is why...

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:50.390
Why what?

00:14:50.431 --> 00:14:53.351
[HUGO] Never mind.
Forgive my ramblings.

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:55.603
We should be preparing
for the attack.

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:58.940
Oh, and Ray. It's not
a crime to kill tians

00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:02.318
as long as they're criminals,
or if it's in self‐defense.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.152
Remember that.

00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:04.570
‐‐I'll try to.

00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:06.656

00:15:08.157 --> 00:15:10.952
[RAY] They must've kidnapped
even more kids.

00:15:10.993 --> 00:15:18.000
Okay, I can hear them talking.
"Once we get back to the fort.

00:15:18.042 --> 00:15:22.505
Kill the brats. It's payback
for arresting our buddies."

00:15:22.547 --> 00:15:24.924
[HUGO] Appears there'll
be no stay of execution.

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:25.967
Commence with the plan!

00:15:42.066 --> 00:15:43.526
All right. That's our cue!

00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:44.444

[RAY]
Yeah.

00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:56.747
The Tomb Labyrinth had the same
kind of rotten stench to it.

What did those
bastards do to them?

00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:10.011
[NEMESIS]
I can't believe it.

00:16:10.052 --> 00:16:12.805
Murdering children, then
bringing them back to life.

00:16:12.847 --> 00:16:14.265
[RAY]
Are you gonna be okay?

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:16.017
[NEMESIS]
It's not that I'm scared.

00:16:16.058 --> 00:16:18.728
No. I'm seething with fury!

00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:22.148
You and me both.
Tell me, Nemesis,

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.859
do you know what happens to
the undead after they're killed?

00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:27.653
[NEMESIS] I'm not sure.
But ending their suffering

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:30.031
is the most merciful thing
we can do for them now.

00:16:30.072 --> 00:16:31.532
[RAY]
Yeah.

00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:35.828
I was too late.

Congratulations.

00:16:57.767 --> 00:17:00.686
You've successfully eliminated
over 100 Undead

00:17:00.728 --> 00:17:02.438
at the appropriate level,

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.732
meeting the necessary kill
count and conditions

00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:06.943
for the Paladin job.

00:17:06.984 --> 00:17:11.322
You've now unlocked the

Thank you.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.922
[RAY]
What I'm feeling...

00:17:27.964 --> 00:17:29.840
Is this what Hugo meant?

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:32.635
The sensation he was
trying to tell me about?

00:17:32.677 --> 00:17:35.263
[NEMESIS] Indeed.
If the Master of a Maiden

00:17:35.304 --> 00:17:38.599
truly believes that Infinite
Dendrogram is more than a game

00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:44.522
and every tian has awareness,
the same as the human players,

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:47.483
then each life feels
precious to them.

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:50.319
All too real, and no
different from their own.

00:17:50.361 --> 00:17:54.657
[RAY] All too real.
You're probably right.

00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:58.619
[NEMESIS] It must be painful for
you here. In a place where lives

00:17:58.661 --> 00:18:01.455
are lost far more easily
than in your own world.

00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:03.249
[RAY]
Yes, it is.

00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:05.376
Rather than having to
experience those feelings

00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:07.003
over and over again,

00:18:07.044 --> 00:18:09.046
there must have been countless
players who couldn't bear it

00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:10.798
and left this world for good.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:14.677
But not me. Not yet.
I'm far from being broken.

00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:18.055
I'm not going anywhere till I
rescue the surviving children.

00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:20.766
And I don't intend on
breaking my promise.

00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:24.228
But above all...

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.606
I'm gonna find the bastards
responsible if it means

00:18:26.647 --> 00:18:30.026
tearing apart this
entire dungeon!

00:18:30.067 --> 00:18:31.652
Let's get 'em, Nemesis!

00:18:31.694 --> 00:18:33.863
[NEMESIS]
Right!

Uninvited guests.

a welcome ceremony

00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:45.249
for our other intruder.

[CYCO] Why didn't you just
use your Embryo's skills?

00:18:51.714 --> 00:18:54.175
Could've made it
easier on yourself.

00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:55.384
You know why.

00:18:55.426 --> 00:18:57.470
We have to wait until
our plan is underway,

00:18:57.511 --> 00:18:59.055
and only then can I unleash it.

00:18:59.096 --> 00:18:59.930
[CYCO]
Stubborn.

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:01.891
So I've been told.

00:19:07.271 --> 00:19:10.232
Damn, that cannon blast hurt.

00:19:10.274 --> 00:19:11.692
It's kinda hot, too!

00:19:11.734 --> 00:19:16.113
[HUGO] He's a giant. Nothing
like the others I fought.

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:18.032
[HUGO] Am I correct in
assuming you're the leader

00:19:18.074 --> 00:19:19.825
of the Gouz‐ Maise Gang?

00:19:19.867 --> 00:19:22.870
Almost. I'm one of its
two great leaders.

00:19:22.912 --> 00:19:26.457
The name's Gouz,
the Strong Gladiator.

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:28.209
Kids taste great,

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:32.129
but I won't pass up the bitter
flavor of a lowlife adult.

00:19:33.714 --> 00:19:38.010
I wasn't aware. Seeing
how I'm not a cannibal

00:19:38.052 --> 00:19:41.847
[GOUZ chuckles]
Just look atcha, all busted up.

00:19:41.889 --> 00:19:45.935
You can't win against me
in that broken pile of junk!

00:19:45.976 --> 00:19:47.728
[GOUZ yelling]

00:19:48.979 --> 00:19:49.772
[HUGO gasps]

00:19:49.814 --> 00:19:51.857
[GOUZ]
Not gonna work!

00:19:58.823 --> 00:20:00.658
I misjudged him.

00:20:04.745 --> 00:20:06.330
[coughs]

00:20:06.372 --> 00:20:08.416
[panting]

00:20:08.457 --> 00:20:12.211
[CYCO] You want to use
the skill now, Hugo?

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:15.631
[HUGO] Should I go through
with it, or keep holding back?

00:20:15.673 --> 00:20:19.593
The way things are going,
I won't be able to defeat him.

00:20:19.635 --> 00:20:22.054
But if I pull the trigger now...

00:20:22.096 --> 00:20:25.683
No. Now's not the time.
I'd screw with our plan.

00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:29.603
Maybe I should run away to
avoid the penalty for dying.

00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:32.440
[GOUZ] You don't mind if I
break for a snack, do ya?

00:20:32.481 --> 00:20:34.734
Just a little pick‐me‐up.

00:20:34.775 --> 00:20:36.610
[HUGO gasping]

00:20:51.125 --> 00:20:53.043
[GOUZ]
Now them's good eatin's‐‐

00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:56.422
though I could go for something
with more sustenance.

00:20:56.464 --> 00:20:57.506
[grunts]

00:21:00.801 --> 00:21:03.387
[CYCO]
Hugo, should we use the skill?

00:21:03.429 --> 00:21:06.056
Why even ask?
You know my answer.

00:21:12.688 --> 00:21:13.856
Gouz!

00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:19.236
I thought you fell asleep
standin' there.

00:21:19.278 --> 00:21:20.654
[HUGO]
You're right.

00:21:20.696 --> 00:21:22.448
I don't know how long
I've been asleep,

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:25.910
but if not for you I
may've never woken up.

00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:27.912
So many excuses.

00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:30.623
"We can't use the skill because
what about the plan?"

00:21:30.664 --> 00:21:32.708
"I'll run away to avoid dying."

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:35.920
I don't know who that was,
but it wasn't me.

00:21:35.961 --> 00:21:38.923
I am the thorn on the rose,
Hugo Lesseps.

00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:40.633
A knight who would
never put his ambitions

00:21:40.674 --> 00:21:43.969
before someone else's life.

00:21:44.011 --> 00:21:47.681
Allow me to convey this in
the clearest possible terms.

00:21:47.723 --> 00:21:52.061
I hereby declare...
you shall not be forgiven!

00:21:52.102 --> 00:21:53.229
[GOUZ]
That's rich!

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:54.980
Pretty big words
coming from a Master

00:21:55.022 --> 00:21:57.483
who treats my world
like it's just a game!

00:21:57.525 --> 00:21:59.777
[HUGO] For the sin of killing
too many people to count,

00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:02.404
I will send you to
the bowels of hell.

00:22:02.446 --> 00:22:05.533
May you rot there forever
and justice be done!

00:22:05.574 --> 00:22:08.953
Then stop talkin'
and do it already!

00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:10.579
Now! It's time!

00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:16.669
[HUGO]
Crest Disguise. Deactivate!

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:17.920
[GOUZ]
What the...?

00:22:17.962 --> 00:22:19.421
Cocytus!

00:22:19.463 --> 00:22:21.507
As you wish, Master.

00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:32.685
[HUGO]
This is my Embryo's true form.

00:22:32.726 --> 00:22:34.895
Type Maiden Chariot...

00:22:39.775 --> 00:22:41.986
[HUGO]
Cocytus!

00:22:42.027 --> 00:22:45.197
[GOUZ] Stop showing off
and fight me like a man!

00:22:45.239 --> 00:22:51.120
[HUGO] <i>La Porte de l'enfer!</i>
Abandon all hope...

00:22:51.161 --> 00:22:52.746
...ye who enter!

00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:59.169
[GOUZ yells]

00:23:02.631 --> 00:23:04.925
[RAY panting]

00:23:08.053 --> 00:23:10.222
[RAY panting]

00:23:11.765 --> 00:23:13.017
Made it in time.

00:23:13.058 --> 00:23:14.643
[NEMESIS]
Master.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.782
[NEMESIS] Is this some
kind of experiment?

00:23:28.824 --> 00:23:31.035
I'm not gonna wait to find out!

00:23:35.414 --> 00:23:36.749
[MAISE]
Die.

00:23:52.222 --> 00:23:54.350
[RAY]
"Beyond the Radix Point."
