00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.550
[NARRATOR]
A fire has been lit under Uzaki,

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.600
as she realizes Sakurai's
graduation is fast approaching.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.850
But her inexperience shows
when she resorts

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.140
to a middle school
bento strategy!

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.940
Later on, her younger sister
Yanagi stops by the café

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.190
during Uzaki's shift,
and in no time at all

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.980
has Sakurai addressing
her by her first name.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.490
As expected, Uzaki is furious.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.820
She's been trying for months
to be on a first-name basis

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.410
with him, and now
within minutes,

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.620
her little sister has
left her in the dust!

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.830
What will happen next!

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.510
[UZAKI] Are you kidding me?
I can't believe you!

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.930
[SAKURAI]
Calm down, will you?

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.430
[UZAKI]
What do you mean calm down?

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.010
I am calm! You think
this is my fault?

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.600
[SAKURAI] Ugh, that's not
what I'm trying to say.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.310
Well then what exactly
are you trying to say?

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.930
If you'd just calm down,
we can talk about it.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.480
[UZAKI] I'm not the problem
here, Mister, you are!

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.020
Oh, I see what's going on here.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.320
Looks like those two still
aren't on a first-name basis.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.070
If you think about it,
that's actually kinda cute.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.660
It really is.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.280
But, when they're alone
this isn't a problem, right?

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.500
Or is it?

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.830
Uh, I'm pretty sure
it's always a problem.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.790
Think about it, if it weren't,

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.340
would they be
fighting right now?

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.170
Hang on, are you telling me
they're not even dating yet?

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.010
I like to think of it
as part of their charm.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.180
It's what makes them "them."
You know what I mean?

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.550
Aren't you supposed to be off?

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.180
I heard Hana's sister
was stopping by,

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.520
so I ran over as
fast as I could!

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.520
Nice to meet you! I'm Ami Asai,
I work with Sakurai and Hana,

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.860
we all go to the same college
together. Yanagi, right?

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.190
Yeah. Nice to meet you?

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.240
You sure are Hana's sister,
all right. What a cutie!

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.780
[YANAGI]
Oh, uh, thank you.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.210
[CAFÉ OWNER] Everything
about this feels wrong.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.170
It's a bit too convenient
that she'd show up

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.540
right as things are
getting interesting.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.710
It's like she has a sixth sense.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.330
How could Ami have known
this was happening?

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.210
Unless!

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.180
[SAKURAI] Huh? Well, okay.
Yanagi it is then.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.510
[UZAKI]
I knew this was gonna happen!

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.130
[chuckles]

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.980
[NARRATOR] At that moment,
the café owner was fighting

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.230
the notion his daughter had
finally gone to the dark side.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.850
Oop--hold please.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.400
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Hm?

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.690
[ASAI] I don't want to miss
a second of whatever this is!

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.660
What? Would you stop
making that face, Uzaki?

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.370
[UZAKI growls]

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.330
Hana...

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.040
Doesn't count! Come on Shinichi!

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.080
You have to use my
first name, remember?

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.830
That's your punishment
for the rest of the day.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.460
Man, do we have to?
This is so embarrassing.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.330
I don't see what's
so embarrassing!

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.710
It's just my name!

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.590
I happen to be quite fond of it,
thank you very much!

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.010
[SAKURAI sighs]
I'm sorry.

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.630
[UZAKI growls]

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.390
Listen Hana,
your name is just fine.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.100
That isn't the problem here.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.560
[UZAKI]
Hm?

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:35.980
This is so awkward to say.
If we're on a first name basis,

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.950
don't you think that'll
give people the idea

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.570
that we're really close?

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.860
What the hell, are you
saying we're not close?

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.540
Whoa! What? No!

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.500
Shinichi! For once in your
life will you think about

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.250
the words that come out
of your mouth, Shinichi?

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.920
I swear you are so
hopeless Shinichi!

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Are you even listening,
Shinichi?

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.000
[YANAGI] Wow, she's really
milking this "Shinichi" thing

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.550
for all it's worth, isn't she.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.220
[CAFÉ OWNER laughing]

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.470
You're right. I-I didn't
mean it and I'm sorry. Okay?

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.980
I mean, we do spend most
of our time together,

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.900
and you've been
there for me a lot.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.900
Sure, we piss each other
off here and there,

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.900
but we always
bounce back, right?

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.940
I shouldn't have been
so quick to write us off.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.280
I acknowledge
we're close friends.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.910
So, does that mean
what I think it means?

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.450
Are you gonna call me
Hana from now on?

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.960
I dunno.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.670
What?! After all that?!
What the hell, man?!

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.800
I'm not even convinced you know
why you won't use my first name.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.760
So let's unpack this
once and for all.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.590
Tell me in front of
everyone why you won't

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.140
call me Hana and be honest!

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.720
What?

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.690
Do you take this for granted?
We've been friends for so long,

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.610
it doesn't matter
how you treat me?

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.280
Because I'm dead serious,
I'm about to lose it with you

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.650
if you keep disrespecting
me the way you are!

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.150
[SAKURAI]
No, it's nothing like that!

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.770
[UZAKI]
Then what is it?!

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.450
Look, I don't mean to be rude,
but you don't have many friends

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.570
and out of all of them,
I am by far your closest!

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.200
And what do I get?

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.070
[SAKURAI]
Ami.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.040
Itsuhito.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.870
Ms. Tsuki.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.030
Yanagi.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.750
Kitties!

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.330
Uzaki...

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.420
[SAKURAI]
That is not what I sound like!

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.290
[UZAKI]
Now listen up, Shinichi.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.420
We've known each other
for five years now!

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:22.850
Since high school!

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.380
Do you have any idea
how long that is?

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.970
Uh, yeah. It's five years.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.300
And yet not five minutes--five
minutes--after you meet her!

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.940
Sorry! Jeez. I didn't mean
anything by it, I swear.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.440
[UZAKI]
I'm the only one who gets

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.360
the last-name treatment.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.230
Was I wrong this whole time

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.610
thinking I meant
something to you?

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.540
Do you not consider me
worthy of being treated

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.370
the same way you
treat everyone else?

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.620
Is there something
wrong with me, Shinichi?

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.380
What? No, hang on.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.090
Just give me a second
to think, okay?

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.380
I'm just feeling put
on the spot is all.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:09.020
I... I guess I have Ami to thank
for the first name thing.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.810
She's been pushing me
really hard lately

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.100
to stop being so
formal all the time.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.770
And well, out of everyone,

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.770
yours is the only one
I'm struggling with.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.980
How do I say this...?

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.110
It's just you're really
special to me.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.830
Wait who said that?

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.370
[gasping]

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.210
[SAKURAI]
Huh? What?

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:44.800
[UZAKI] Y-You just said that
I... I was special to you.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.050
[SAKURAI]
I did?

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.720
[UZAKI]
You did.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.430
Who, me?

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.390
Definitely.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.430
[SAKURAI]
I said it to you?

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.690
[UZAKI]
To me!

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.560
But why?

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:02.310
I dunno! Why are you askin' me?
You're the one who said it!

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.900
But, I mean, if that's how
you really feel about me...

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:09.330
Wait... No!

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.160
Who am I to change your mind?
Special it is!

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.450
[NARRATOR]
Confidence restored!

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.540
[SAKURAI] Uh, hey Uzaki?
Can we forget I said that?

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.160
[UZAKI]
Nope, already heard it!

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.500
And what did I tell you
about today's rule?

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:22.580
[SAKURAI]
Hana.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.380
[UZAKI]
What is it, my darling Shinichi?

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:25.800
[SAKURAI growls]

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.130
Yep, they're in love.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.560
It's kinda cringe to
watch them, actually.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:30.880
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Definitely in love.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:32.470
[ASAI]
Definitely.

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:35.680
[YANAGI] One problem,
that guy's a total airhead.

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:38.440
It's gonna be real hard
for Hana to win him over.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.480
Ah, well. I suppose
I'll just have to lend

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.310
my big sis a hand, now won't I?

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:46.190
[YANAGI]
I'm home!

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.160
Welcome back, honey!

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.740
Crazy how cold it is out there.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.950
[CATS meowing]

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.910
Aw, looks like someone's
happy to see me!

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.710
A fur coat like yours would
be nice right about now.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.590
Oh, right! Guess who
I met today, Mom?

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.720
I visited Hana at her
job and met Sakurai!

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.430
Oh dear, why am I not surprised
you ended up at the café.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.180
Just remember
that's their workplace

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.100
and try not to bother
them too much.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.100
I don't think it was
too much of a problem.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.970
At any rate, they happened to
be closed when I stopped by.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.980
Oh? I wonder why.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.810
Beats me, but the owner
and his daughter

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.940
spent the entire time watching
sis while they ate rice.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.770
They were eating rice?

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.200
It's funny.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.490
He has such scary eyes but
after you get to know him,

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.950
he's actually
really easy to talk to.

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:36.530
He's super into games.
I wonder if he'd be into

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.660
going a few rounds
with me some time.

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:42.630
Who am I to change
your mind? Special it is!

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.760
Heh. The two of them
are so cute.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.970
Hana tries to hide it,
but it's so obvious

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.590
that she's madly
in love with him.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:52.300
Yes. She is, isn't she?

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.930
[TSUKI] Yanagi seems to have
taken quite a liking to Sakurai.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.890
Goodness, if only
my little girl knew

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.930
just how depraved
that boy really was.

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.810
[SAKURAI]
Who has time for monogamy?

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:04.890
You ladies don't have to
wait your turn with me.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.320
I'm happy to take both
of you at the same time

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.440
if you know what I mean.

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:11.410
[SAKURAI laughing]

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.330
[TSUKI] I'd hoped being
with Hana would put an end

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:15.200
to all his debauchery.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.740
[NARRATOR]
Tsuki seems to have decided

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.170
her daughter and Sakurai
are already dating.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.950
Among other things.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.920
[TSUKI gasps] But wait, even
if things have settled down

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.920
between that boy and my Hana,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.840
he could still turn his
unquenchable thirst

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.010
toward Yanagi!
And then who knows what!

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:36.590
My babies! It's one thing
to lust after me, but them?

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.140
He's pretty cool!

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.350
I wonder if he'd ever want to
hang out just the two of us?

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:42.890
Yanagi, you can't!

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.270
Huh?

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:46.480
Think about it, sweetheart,
you're in middle school!

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.480
I don't want you alone with him!

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:50.820
I'm sorry but I'm putting
my foot down here.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.530
The next time you
go to that café,

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.530
you're bringing me with you!

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:55.610
Really?

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.620
[TSUKI]
Do you understand me?

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.370
Yeah, sure. Understood.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:02.620
[TSUKI] That should've
gone without saying.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.160
She's a middle-schooler!

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:08.170
But now that I think about it,
even Hana is still a child!

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:12.710
It's up to me as their
mother to guide them!

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.890
[YANAGI] I appreciate her
looking out and all,

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:18.310
but middle-schoolers go to
cafés all the time nowadays.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:21.600
Does she just wanna
go to the café, too?

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.850
My, my! What's going on here?

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:26.350
Don't tell me you're
having fun without me.

You've got me curious,
fill me in!

Did you go out? It must
be a special occasion--

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.030
you usually stay
home on Sundays!

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:37.240
I want to hear all about it!
Come on Yanagi, tell me!

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.700
It's nothing serious, Daddy.
Don't worry about it.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.820
It doesn't have
anything to do with you!

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:46.160
But why not?
I wanted to have fun, too.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:48.040
I'm lonely.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.330
[YANAGI]
This is for the best.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.220
If I tell Dad,
he'll totally freak out.

Oh, hey Kiri.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:02.020
I hope we're not
being too loud in here.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.310
Let us know if we are, okay?

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:07.270
Is it me, or does
Kiri seem upset?

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:09.390
[TSUKI] Poor kid is up
to his neck in finals.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.270
He's been stressed out all week.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.820
[FUJIO] And to top it all off,
he's not very good at studying.

[YANAGI] Well, I'll be right
there with him.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.530
I've got exams this week, too.

Better get to it then!
But I know you'll do fine,

Much better than

I'm right here, ya know.
I can hear you talking!

I'm so sick of this!
I wanna work out!

Oh yeah, that's right.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.920
There's no club stuff
during exams week, huh.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.170
Good, your studies
are more important.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.850
You worked hard to get
into that high school--

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.460
I expect you to keep at it.

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:41.470
That means keeping your
grades up, understand?

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:43.890
Look at it this way, you can
do all the club activities

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.390
you want once finals are over.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:49.350
Yeah, I know, but if I wait,
it's not gonna be the same.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.740
Oh yeah, right. Winter's
for building stamina.

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.350
It's all running and
weight training, isn't it?

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.900
So if you start up after exams,

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:59.450
you won't be on the same
level as everyone else.

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:00.530
Yeah, exactly!

We just reserve it for athletes.

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.400
It's on the far right
as you enter.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.230
You'll pretty much
have it all to yourself.

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:05.860
[NARRATOR] Side note,
rules may vary from gym to gym,

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.400
so always remember
to check first.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:11.290
[FUJIO] We have the whole pool
divided into lanes and labeled.

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.900
But seeing as most of our
clientele are older folks

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.160
with bad legs,
a lot of it goes to waste.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.910
[SAKURAI]
Huh. You don't say.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.920
Like I said, you'll probably
have it to yourself,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.380
so don't hesitate to go all out!

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.250
And let me know if
you need anything, okay?

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:27.890
Sounds good to me.
Thanks for the pro tip.

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:32.470
[FUJIO] I'd recognize that
thousand-yard stare anywhere.

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:35.850
Sakurai must have something
on his mind again.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.220
I bet it's girl trouble.

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:40.810
Oh, to be young again.

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:42.770
[NARRATOR]
Poor Fujio still had no idea

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:46.480
the "girl" in question
was his own daughter.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:50.370
Dammit! Why are there so many
gym-rat geezers in this place?

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:53.950
Whatever, it's time
for the real work out.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:00.790
[KIRI] It'll feel so good to
swim again! It's been a while.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:02.370
I bet this indoor pool
will be happy

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.380
to have an actual athlete
using it for once! Huh?

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:09.630
Oh what, I thought I'd have
the advanced lane to myself.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:12.050
Who's this random dude?

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:14.340
Eh, I mean he can't be
that great if he comes

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:16.180
to a gym full of
old people, right?

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.600
I'm sure he's nothing
to worry about.

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:23.770
Ooo wee! We've got some real
swimmers in the pool today!

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:25.480
They're even using
the advanced lane!

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.730
Are you sure they're human?

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.660
I've never seen
anyone swim like that!

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:36.040
[OLD MAN F]
You know, I'll tell ya!

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.870
Watching them brings me back!

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.120
It must feel great
to swim like that!

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.540
[KIRI screaming]

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.210
[NARRATOR]
It did not feel great.

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.460
[KIRI] What the hell?
How is he so fast?

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.460
He's leaving me
in the dust here!

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:51.380
Dammit, Dad, why did I agree
to come to this stupid gym!

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.000
How am I supposed
to blow off stream

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:55.130
with this guy
stealing all my glory?

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.350
I don't know who he is,

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.310
but he's in my lane and
he's pissing me off!

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:02.520
That does it! I'm catching
up to him no matter what!

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.980
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
in Sakurai's inner monologue:

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.440
[SAKURAI] So much for
trying to clear my head.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.440
It's just, you're
really special to me.

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:13.410
[UZAKI gasping]

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:14.830
[SAKURAI]
The more time passes,

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.450
the more I find myself
obsessing over it!

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:20.870
It's just, you're
really special to me.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:27.000
[SAKURAI groans] Why did I say
that? What was I thinking?

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.870
I'll just have to
swim even harder,

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.750
until I can't focus
on anything else!

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.130
I'll swim until I pass out!

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:34.800
[NARRATOR]
Exercise was quickly becoming

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.010
an unhealthy means of
escaping his anxiety.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:39.180
[SAKURAI]
Be gone, thoughts!

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.600
It's just, you're
really special to me.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.520
Forget! Forget,
damn you, forget!

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.350
You're really special to me.

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:46.560
[KIRI]
Dammit! This dude is insane!

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.310
But I haven't given up yet!
I will catch up!

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:55.440
[KIRI] Huh?
Wait, did he lap me already?

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:58.200
He's a monster!

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:03.040
You know what, fine! I give up!
Who the hell is this guy?

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:07.830
[panting]

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.630
[KIRI]
That was... the hardest

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:13.550
I've ever pushed and
he still lapped me twice.

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:22.720
[KIRI] My body feels like
it's about to give out.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:26.480
The other guy seemed fine.
What am I doing here.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:30.730
No! I'm just out of shape from
all that studying, that's all!

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:33.980
I wasn't at the top of my game,
and he took advantage of it!

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:36.700
That's right. What a loser!

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:39.200
[NARRATOR] Like the sore loser
he was, he came up with

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.870
excuse after excuse to
let himself off the hook.

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:44.450
[KIRI] I'm at my worst,
mentally and physically!

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.130
Not to mention it wasn't a club
activity or a tournament.

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:50.300
My head wasn't in the game!
I didn't give it my all.

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:51.840
Yeah, that's right.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:55.380
If I were in peak condition,
there's no way he'd outswim me.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:56.800
It's him!

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:07.430
[KIRI gasping]

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:11.730
[screaming]

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.950
Again? What happened this time?

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.670
Dunno, I've been afraid to go
near him ever since he got home.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:31.000
Maybe he'll cheer up

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.500
if we make him one of his
favorite dishes tonight?

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:34.760
I'm home!

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.840
Hi, girls! Uh,
where's your mother?

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.800
I think she went to go
take a bath, what's up?

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.630
Nothing! Oh! Hey!

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.140
How'd it go, kiddo?
Did you like your dad's gym?

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:51.270
You know nothing would make me
happier than if you signed up!

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:54.770
Huh? What's wrong?
Somethin' happen?

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.280
Are you in shock over
how sweet our gear is?

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.150
And how about that
advanced lane in the pool?

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.660
I bet you killed it!

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.530
[KIRI gasping]

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:04.570
[FUJIO]
Uh, what is it?

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.160
[NARRATOR] A sense of failure
unlike anything the boy

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:11.870
had ever known had been forever
etched into his very soul.
