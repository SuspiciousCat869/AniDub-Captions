WEBVTT

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.310
[inhales, exhales]

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.030
It's freezing. What gives?

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.570
I mean, it is December.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.500
You know, you've been
awfully quiet all day long.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.000
What's up? Did you catch
a cold or something?

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.090
Uh! Uh, no! What're you
going on about?

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.010
I feel fit as a fiddle!

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.380
I-It's just... Um...

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.050
I was thinking that
the two of us

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.180
have been hanging out
for a while now,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.390
but this'll be the first time
we've spent Christmas together.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.390
[laughs]

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.140
Yeah, it is.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.290
[inaudible]

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.640
[SAKURAI]
Uzaki.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.900
[UZAKI gasping]

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.360
[UZAKI]
Um, Sakurai?

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.970
[SAKAKI] Oh boy,
it's still as hot as ever.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.350
Huh?

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.560
Yo, what's good?

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.270
Haven't seen you since we
got back from vay-cay...

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.990
Uh...

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.660
[SAKAKI]
You okay?

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.450
Cause you're giving off some
seriously haunted vibes.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.910
Summer's over and I'm in denial.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.660
You did have three
months to enjoy it.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.790
It's only been a few days
since he packed up

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.090
and went about his way,
and yet his absence feels like a

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.630
gaping hole deep
within my chest.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.630
We're personifying
the seasons now, huh?

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.760
Wow, I had no idea
that you had it this bad.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.930
Wait, where's the meathead?

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.020
Oh, I see, bet that's why
she's in such a mood.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.890
Well, Saku should get here soon.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.770
Why not make some plans
to cheer yourself up?

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.230
You can still hang out through
the school year, right?

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.690
What I meant was,
it doesn't have

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.780
to be summer for us to hang.
We'll always be together.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.700
Right. Whatever you say!

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.660
[SAKAKI]
Glad to hear it.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.580
You guys are like besties,
aren't you?

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.170
--Huh?
--Ever since high school, yeah?

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.250
[UZAKI] Nah, we weren't
that close at first.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.880
[SAKAKI]
Uh, why not?

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.880
Have you seen the mug
on that mean old jerk?

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.210
Heh, heh...

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.130
I had him pegged him
for a hoodlum,

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.840
scared the crap outta me.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.600
Jeez, what if Saku
heard you say that?

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.180
[SAKAKI] You'd probably
say it to his face anyway.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.020
Actually, I talked
to Ami about it.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.270
My first impression
of him was awful.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.150
What? I didn't know
that was the case.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.360
Figures as much since that fool
doesn't tell me anything!

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.490
[laughs] Take that, sucker!

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:24.910
[screams]

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.040
So, was there something
that sparked your friendship?

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.000
Something specific, or...?

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.870
Y'know, a moment.
Like one that made you

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.710
realize Sakurai wasn't
so scary after all.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.090
Well, come to think
of it. Maybe.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.010
[SAKURAI] First, stay calm
and relax your body.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.430
Keep your form when
you're gliding through.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.470
Right! I'll give it a try!

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.350
[SAKURAI]
You're almost there. Keep it up.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.890
[UZAKI]
Yeah, maybe a few things.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.190
[SAKAKI]
Mm-hm. Continue.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.150
[UZAKI] Anyway, he may
have major bad guy face,

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.740
but he's actually
super considerate.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.660
And then, once I started getting
to know him a little more,

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.780
talking to him
wasn't such a big deal.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.490
I asked him to give me
swimming lessons,

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.620
and the rest is history.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.830
Yo.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.630
Huh? Hey, Saku!

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.460
[UZAKI]
Jeez, took ya long enough!

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.210
Why were you runnin' late,
ya slacker?

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.750
Did you oversleep or what?

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.300
Looks like someone's
stuck in vacation mode.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.630
Time to wake up, lazybones!

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.100
[SAKURAI]
Ugh, would you knock it off?

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.890
It's too early for
all that racket.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.310
We don't even have
homeroom today!

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.270
[SAKAKI] Whoa, talking about
Saku snapped her right out

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:39.360
of that funk. Heh. I guess
that's where they're at now.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.570
Yikes, just date already.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.530
Right. Listen, guys.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.320
If you're still feeling
hungry for summer

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.280
and need an excuse to hang,

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.660
then how 'bout this?

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.120
[SAKURAI] Why're you dragging me
into her issues?

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.790
[UZAKI, SAKURAI]
Bowling?

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.250
[SAKAKI]
Can't speak for Uzaki,

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.090
but all you did besides work
was play games, no?

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.210
[SAKURAI grunts]

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.920
Oof, bad idea.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.720
This guy couldn't bowl if
his life depended on it!

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.050
Trust me, it's hysterical.
He chucks the ball at the pins

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.220
like a caveman
getting at a piñata.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.600
It's obvious that a precision
sport like bowling

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.270
is way beyond his capabilities!

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.100
But when you're a dense
klutz like Sakurai,

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.770
there's only so much you can do!

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.690
[laughs]

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.280
[SAKAKI]
I guess you're coming with then?

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.530
[SAKURAI]
Oh, it's on.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.370
Here you go.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.870
Great. One sec, okay?

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:37.500
Is it that bad?

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.130
Don't say I didn't warn you.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:40.790
Let's spice things up!

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.250
Whoever comes in last has to do
whatever the winner says.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.760
I was gonna sit this one out,

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.680
but don't hold off
on my account.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.220
[SAKURAI grumbles]

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.260
You're all good to go.
You can head over to Lane 12.

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:56.310
[UZAKI]
All right, here we go!

00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:00.110
Whoever wins or loses,
no hard feelings allowed.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.860
I wonder what I'll
make you do first?

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.320
Yeah, yeah, keep on jabbering.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.700
I'm surprised you're
not going off on her.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.820
Getting riled up would only
play out in her favor

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.660
and seeing me flustered
is exactly what she wants.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:17.000
I see. So, victory
hinges on whether Uzaki

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.420
can throw you off your game,

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.540
or if you can maintain
your focus.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.300
Is this what you
two do together?

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.840
The way y'all have
fun sounds stressful.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.720
For real. I think I'm
giving myself a hernia.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.640
In any case, losing
my cool won't help me.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.930
I just have to stay calm
and go with the flow--

00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:43.190
You dirty little menace!

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.270
The battle's already begun.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.070
Yay! I'm going first
'cause I'm the best.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.820
Ugh, still two more!

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.950
That's embarrassing
after all that trash talk.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.870
In terms of skill, we're about
the same level, though.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.250
[UZAKI] You're up next,
slowpoke. C'mon, chop-chop!

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:03.590
[SAKURAI]
Whatever.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:09.720
The way you're bluffing
right now is commendable,

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.090
but it won't take
anything for me

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.350
to break that
poker face in half.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.180
[SAKAKI]
More psychological warfare.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.980
[SAKURAI inhales, exhales]

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.230
[SAKURAI grunts]

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.910
Whoa, he bowled a strike!

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.950
[SAKURAI] You see, it's not
about the poker face.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:40.750
I mean, I worked on it, but I
didn't see much improvement.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.210
[gasps]

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.380
That strike? That was me

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.630
channeling every bit of my
rage for you in one throw!

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:49.630
[SAKAKI]
That is beyond lame.

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.470
So, it's your usual
caveman thing,

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.380
but with a bit more
"oomph" behind it.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:55.140
That does require luck, but it's

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.350
probably better than
whatever she's doing.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.140
You've gotta be kidding.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.600
Watch what you say.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.850
The more you piss him off,
the more powerful he'll get.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.770
No way. Are you such a loner

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.360
that you even go bowling by
yourself? Oh, how pitiful!

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.530
[SAKAKI]
That's your response?

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.820
Shut your trap!
And don't even go there!

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:20.120
Nice going. Now you've riled
him up so much that he can

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.960
dish out an even
more powerful throw.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.790
Huh?

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.260
You got this, big guy!

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.720
Sweet. Nothing like
a little pep talk.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.430
But that was dirty!

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:41.020
It evens out. If he gets to take
the brute force approach,

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.230
then I get to troll him
until he starts choking.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:49.110
The way you smile when you
say that is pretty disturbing.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.400
[sneezes]

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.360
[inaudible]

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.540
Sakurai wins.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.880
[panting] That was
one tough battle.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.670
[UZAKI growls]

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.670
[SAKAKI] Maybe you should've
focused on your game

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.760
instead of on sabotage.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.840
[whistles]

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.630
Save your breath.
This is her game.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.510
You guys sure have some
interesting priorities.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.680
Anyway, isn't one of you
supposed to start doing

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:24.730
whatever the winner says?

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:28.020
Hey, nobody asked you
to butt in!

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.900
Dude. Now's your chance!

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.020
For what?

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.610
You're seriously hopeless, man!

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:36.700
Say, how about we go
for another round?

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.410
Sure. I'm down!

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:39.910
You better bring it.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.740
Otherwise I'll win, and you'll
have to do whatever I say.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.290
Get real.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.750
You really think I'd let myself
bow to a cheap idiot like you?

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.960
[SAKAKI]
Jeez. Why are you only ever

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.880
this aggressive with each other?

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.750
Getting one up on
this jerk is something

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.550
that makes life worth living.

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.170
And she's the last fool
I'd wanna lose to!

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.760
Yeah? Well tough luck!

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.550
[NARRATOR]
Sensing that he was in territory

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.890
no outsider could penetrate,
Sakaki stepped back.

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:07.640
Yet he couldn't help but think.

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:09.600
[SAKAKI]
Just go for it already!

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:12.770
[NARRATOR]
Such was the state of affairs.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:16.110
[CAFÉ OWNER] I'm off,
gotta run to that meeting.

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:18.070
We've gone over
this a million times!

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.870
We're closing for the day
while you're out. I've got it.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.120
Off you go now!

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.710
[ASAI] The truth is, I haven't
told our two employees

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:33.210
anything about this.

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:35.460
I've been waiting for
dad to leave the cafe

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.920
for quite some time.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:42.100
Yes, ever since that night.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.100
The night that a fire
was lit deep within.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.850
Powerful feelings
have consumed me.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.020
I can't hold back any longer!

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.230
[laughing]

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:56.570
[ASAI] I am putting Hana
to work as a bunny girl!

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.700
A classic all-black uniform.
Who can resist?

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.160
A visual upgrade like that will

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.280
pull in customers
and boost sales.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.410
I've got something
for Sakurai, too.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.960
Something to drive
the housewives wild!

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.960
Who am I kidding,
it's mostly for me!

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.590
Might as well get to enjoy
some quality aesthetics

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.210
while I'm on the job.
Dad would never allow it,

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.510
but if I can get those
two in on it, then maybe...

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:23.430
[SAKURAI] You fried a
mean egg this morning.

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:26.100
Gosh, you really can't
cook a thing, can you?

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.100
Oh. How's it hanging, Ami?

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.310
[SAKURAI]
Yo, where's the head honcho?

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:32.520
Oh, he just stepped out
for a moment.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.730
Hey, I know this
is totally random,

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:37.110
but how do new uniforms
sound to you?

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.610
That's an awkward segue.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:40.110
Are we changing them up?

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.910
Just tossing out ideas.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:45.950
As a matter of fact,
I have some ready to go.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:47.950
Try 'em on and tell me
what you think!

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.000
[UZAKI]
Hm? Like right this second?

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:54.540
You're awfully well prepared
for someone "tossing out ideas."

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:56.880
We can't do try-ons
when customers are here!

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.090
C'mon, c'mon,
less talking, more walking!

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:00.340
[SAKURAI]
Whoa! Quit pushing!

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:01.510
[UZAKI]
Wait, why the rush?

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:04.550
[ASAI screams]

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.560
So sexy! You look
bodacious, girl!

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.060
I appreciate the compliments

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:13.730
but maybe you can be
a little less direct.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:17.520
And plus, this doesn't seem
very practical to work in.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:19.610
I do have to bend sometimes.

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:22.240
[ASAI grunts]
Fair point there.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.280
Well, how bout this one?
Here you go!

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:32.460
Perfection. Only one word
that comes to mind.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:35.210
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you're creeping me out.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:38.170
As long as I get to see this,
I'll gladly accept that!

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.380
But this dress would be even
harder to work in than

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:45.760
the last one. And it clashes
with the vibe here, so...

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.260
It's kinda specific, you know.
Is the boss cool with this?

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:50.600
[ASAI grunts]

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.480
[ASAI laughs nervously]

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.770
[UZAKI] Let's see what's
in these other bags.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.270
Why the sudden rush?

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.190
Wait, I wanted to savor
them one by one!

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.450
You're getting them
out of order!

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:06.610
[UZAKI] What the heck is this?
Another stupid costume?

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.160
How do you expect me to work
wearing uniforms like these?

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.160
[ASAI]
But those ears suit you so!

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.330
I knew this had nothing
to do with work.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:16.580
You're just making us play
dress up while your dad's gone!

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:17.630
Damn straight!

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:19.540
[UZAKI]
You're not even denying it!

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:22.130
Oh no, what about Sakurai?

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:24.260
[SAKURAI]
Uh, is this right?

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.130
The bag you gave me
had nothing in it

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.300
except a pair of
leather hotpants.

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:30.930
[UZAKI] Ugh, of course
there was nothing else!

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:32.810
What on earth were
you thinking, Ami?

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:36.230
In what world do café employees
wear this type of stuff?

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:37.850
Maybe they don't,
but I'm going to be

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.690
the person who makes them do it!

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.190
[SAKURAI]
Don't! No one wants to see that!

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:44.780
[ASAI] Like, why can't there be
one lousy café where you can

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.950
look at some manly nipples
while you work?

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:49.160
What the--

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.200
Why though?
When you were in high school,

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.240
you got to feast
your eyes every day.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:56.120
It's not fair, I wanna
see some nip-nops, too!

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:58.120
I was in the swim club,
remember?

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:00.250
No one was feasting
on anything, so chill!

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.040
[ASAI]
Nuh-uh, I don't believe you.

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:04.840
You got to have pecs,
you got the fantasy!

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.220
For real?

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.800
She's inconsolable.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.800
And she's supposed to be
the responsible one.

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:13.180
[TSUKI]
Pardon me?

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:14.390
[UZAKI]
Mom?

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:16.980
I do hope you
aren't closed today.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.480
Oh, goodness!
You look cute, dear!

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.610
It's you!

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:21.480
Yes?

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.110
Dude, that's my mother!

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:25.820
Not to put you on the spot,
but do you want a job?

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:26.950
Sorry?

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:29.360
Wear one of those
and you're hired!

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:30.950
No, I could never!

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:34.080
She's not even bothering
to sugarcoat it anymore.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.870
She's gone beyond shameless
and sunk to a new low.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.620
But there's nothing
you can't wear.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.330
I've had my eye on you,
so I can tell!

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.670
What is this conversation?

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:44.420
If you don't like frilly
clothes then you can

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.380
just wear something simple,
like a T-shirt!

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.760
Yes, a plain white tee
would be more than fine!

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.300
Over a swimsuit, of course!

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.470
Actually, forget the swimsuit,
the T-shirt would be enough,

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:55.180
the shirt would be perfectly
reasonable, right?

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.350
I could wrangle a stage
in the middle of the café

00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:00.190
and have you and Hana
stand on it together!

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.900
--[CAFÉ OWNER] Uh-huh.
--[ASAI] And then!

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.570
--[CAFÉ OWNER] And then?
--[laughs]

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:04.940
I'll soak both of you!

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.280
You sure about that?

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.120
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Mm-hm.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.210
[ASAI whimpers,
laughs nervously]

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.800
Uh, Ami. Why are
you wearing that?

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.550
[ASAI] Well actually, it's cause
I've been thinking about

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:34.760
the future of this café.

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:36.350
Guess she's not big
on the outfits

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.270
when she's the one
wearing em, eh?

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.640
You know you're
gawking at her, right?

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:43.190
[SAKURAI]
Uh-- No, I'm not!

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:44.900
[TSUKI laughs]

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:50.190
[UZAKI] Aw c'mon, you can't
fall asleep on me yet.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.570
We're not done playing.
One more round!

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:56.200
Don't tell me you wanna
go down as a loser!

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.870
[SAKURAI]
Listen, it's two in the morning.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:01.750
All I'm asking for is
another round, okay?

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.330
Are you listening? Hey, Sakurai!

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.670
[SAKURAI snoring]

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:08.670
[UZAKI]
Hold up. Did you fall asleep?

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.010
I can't beat this guy
all by myself, y'know!

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.630
Quit being a coward
and wake up already!

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.680
That's enough! Do you
know what time it is now?

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:20.140
[UZAKI] Whoa, hang on, Mom!
I need to save my game.

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:21.810
Can you please
let go of that plug?

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:22.690
[TSUKI]
Yoink!

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:25.400
[UZAKI screaming]

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:30.230
[yawns]

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.990
Dude, you look exhausted.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.950
Uzaki's been keeping
me up lately

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.950
and every time I tell her
to go to sleep already.

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:40.540
She always screams
for another round.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.870
[SAKAKI] Even though it sounds
like something else,

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:47.040
I know they're just gaming.
Those nerds.

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:51.300
Wanna nap till second period?
I'll wake you up.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.300
[SAKURAI grunts]
Yes, please.

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.720
[CLASSMATE A] So guess what
Ito's boyfriend did next!

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.510
[CLASSMATE B]
What, tell me!

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.220
Hey now, don't say it out loud.

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:02.810
[yawns]

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:06.060
Over here, Hana.
We saved a seat for you.

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:07.900
Aww. Thanks, you guys.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.070
[SAKAKI]
Speak of the devil.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:13.570
She still hasn't seen you.
You can keep snoozing.

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:16.700
Not gonna lie, sure wish
I had a boyfriend, too!

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.070
I don't know.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.540
Relationships sure can be
a lot of work sometimes.

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.540
That look on your face does
tell me you enjoy it, though!

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:26.500
Nah, count me out,
boyfriends are such a hassle.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:27.630
[GIRLS]
Huh?

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:29.540
But I could've sworn
that you have one.

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:31.250
--[UZAKI] Uh?
--[SAKAKI] Huh?

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.630
You know, that guy you
always walk home with.

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:35.670
[CLASSMATE B] Oh! The tall one
with the scary face.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.300
[ITO] Yeah! I've seen you
two hit it off together,

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:40.470
and definitely more than once.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.770
You see? I told you that's how
the both of you come across.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.600
[SAKAKI laughs] Let's go!
With all this girl talk,

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:49.650
Uzaki might spill
her true feelings.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:52.860
Nah, it isn't like
that between us.

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:56.030
I see hanging out
with him as a favor.

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:59.200
Uh, how so?

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.280
For starters,
he's such a downer!

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:03.120
He doesn't have
too many friends,

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.620
and he's always on his own,

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.580
but he was my upperclassman
in high school,

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:07.660
so I've gotta check in on him.

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:10.130
I can't just abandon
the poor thing!

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:12.170
[SAKAKI]
Is this her being sincere?

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:14.550
[UZAKI]
Basically, I have no choice.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:15.710
[CLASSMATE B]
Really?

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:19.130
[UZAKI] Pretty much.
He can be a handful!

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:22.430
[SAKAKI] Crap, he's
definitely hearing this.

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:29.100
[SAKURAI] That brat! Running
her mouth off like that.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:32.070
Dammit, this sucks.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:35.030
I got tired again
coming back after lunch.

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.860
I couldn't catch a wink
with all that talking.

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:40.780
I'll just sleep off
my indignation.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:48.660
[UZAKI panting]
Ha! I knew you'd be here!

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:50.630
I'm glad I caught you!

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:52.040
Huh?

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.460
Look at you, passing out
wherever you please.

00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:01.680
A thickheaded oaf without
a care in the world.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.180
I have been keeping him up
late these past few days.

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:07.640
Oh, well. We have our
next class together,

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:10.060
so I'll wait till he wakes up.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:12.980
[UZAKI]
Hm?

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:33.540
Ha.

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.630
[UZAKI]
Not keeping that one.

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:38.090
[yawns]

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.640
[CLASSMATE A] So, this is
where she ran off to.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.020
[CLASSMATE B]
Fourth period's about to start!

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.600
[SAKAKI]
You two dumdums.

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:55.020
You can deny it till
you're both in your graves.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:56.820
[CLASSMATE A] Hana said
they weren't dating,

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.480
but that's a lie.

00:21:58.570 --> 00:21:59.610
[CLASSMATES]
Yep.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:03.110
[SAKAKI]
Heh. You aren't fooling anyone.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:07.120
Now, which one would be
funnier to wake up first?
