WEBVTT

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.550
[shutter clicks]

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.220
[SAKAKI] And that's pretty
much how it went down.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.640
Who said you could take those?

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.140
You gotta delete that right now!

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.980
Something juicy happened when
I wasn't around to see it?

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.350
You should've
called me right away!

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.860
Sorry, it must've
just slipped my mind.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.070
[ASAI] You guys aren't
snubbing me, are you?

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.570
No, nothing like that.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.200
We would never.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.530
Do you mean it?

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.030
[UZAKI, SAKURAI]
Mm-hm.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.280
How 'bout we make it up to you

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.290
and hang out all
together sometime?

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.830
That sounds pretty good, right?
So, we cool?

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.380
Totes cool!

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.840
Long as I get front row seats
to the Sakuzaki show,

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.550
I'm down to clown!

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.590
[SAKAKI] Yeesh. Always
scheming, that one.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.640
[SAKAKI] Let's figure out
what we're doing then.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.850
[SAKURAI]
Good idea.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.930
[UZAKI] Ooh, I could use
some retail therapy!

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.560
Ah, to be young again.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.950
Now that you're an
upperclassman, you barely even

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.410
have to go to class, huh.
Must be nice.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.250
You'll be free soon,
so hang in there.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.340
Uzaki struggles when she
has to write an essay.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.130
Look, that stuff is a breeze
when I apply myself!

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.470
I bet.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.050
Besides, I have tons of friends
who can tutor me.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.300
Unlike a certain
sweaty try-hard loner

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.010
whose name rhymes
with pah-ku-pie!

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.350
Then you won't be
needing me I suppose.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.350
Uh! Hey! That's against
the rules, you jerk!

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.060
[SAKURAI]
What are you even talking about?

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.400
It's your obligation as an
upperclassman to help me!

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.280
[laughs] Well then, guess
he won't have to worry

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.110
about getting one-upped
in academics.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.450
Ugh. I hardly see you, either.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.950
Are you even graduating
at this rate?

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.200
You gonna get held back?

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.580
[SAKURAI]
Heh. You kidding?

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.000
That guy's got more
creds than I do.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.290
[gasps]

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.210
[SAKURAI]
Itsuhito's something else.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.210
He registers for
easy classes where all

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.130
he has to do is show up
once in a while

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.470
and hand in a paper to pass.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.550
[ASAI] Some people just happen
to be gifted like that.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.300
Well you know what they say,
"work smarter not harder."

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.560
Ah!

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.180
[ASAI] What do you do
with all your free time?

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.390
[SAKAKI]
Uh, I really like to go camping.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.730
[ASAI]
Ooh, that sounds nice!

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.310
[UZAKI]
So not fair.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.400
[NARRATOR] It was a way of life
Uzaki had no hope of imitating.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.780
[UZAKI]
Wanna check out the swimsuits?

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.200
[ASAI]
Let's go.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.700
[ASAI] Why do you need
another swimsuit, anyway?

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.080
Because... I've been going to
the pool a lot more lately.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.040
[ASAI]
Have you?

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.960
Yeah, with Sakurai.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.960
[ASAI]
I need details!

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.000
[UZAKI] After we went to
the beach that one time,

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.340
he's started being
more physically active.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.310
Here, take a look.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.690
[SAKURAI]
Thanks. Crap, my times suck.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.850
My swim club days are long gone.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.900
Listen, they may have
pool lanes here,

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.820
but it doesn't mean you have
to act like it's a competition.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.240
[SAKURAI]
Sorry. Old habit.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.900
Okay, time for a relaxing dip!

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.780
[UZAKI]
Right!

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.780
[SAKURAI]
Oh, by the way.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.540
[UZAKI]
What?

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.370
Cute swimsuit today...
today... today...

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.710
[UZAKI gasping]

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.040
Weird, right?

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.550
Like, that compliment came
out of nowhere, ya know?

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.920
But it felt nice, so I thought
I'd buy some more.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.970
[ASAI] Start with a
swimsuit compliment.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.930
Not mine, you idiot!

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.970
Aha. The pupil
becomes the master.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.930
Pleased to hear my advice
is being put to use.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.350
[SAKURAI]
Let's see... A-choo!

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.940
He probably didn't
mean anything by it...

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.360
[ASAI]
Hana looks so happy right now.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.820
Why say anything that could
spoil the mood?

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.110
I wish I'd got to see
her all embarrassed

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.870
about her swimsuit
compliment! No fair!

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.120
[BOY A]
Mom! She's crying blood!

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.910
[UZAKI grunting]

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.370
[SAKURAI grunts]

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.880
[UZAKI grunting]

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.340
[SAKURAI grunts]

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.340
[grunts]

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.460
[SAKURAI grunting]

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.460
Ah!

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.880
Here!

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.550
[UZAKI]
C'mon, try to keep up!

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.390
[SAKURAI] Could you not yell?
It's distracting!

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.350
Atta boy. For a guy who says
he's totally hopeless

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.600
when it comes to sports,

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.060
he's actually warmed up
to this pretty quickly.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.020
Now just imagine how
"hot" stuff could get

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.150
if something indecent
were to happen.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.690
This isn't really
that kinda game, Ami.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.110
[ASAI]
With some changes, it could be.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.610
[yelling]

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.410
No! Not the no-no bits!

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.330
Hey, you two down
for a mini-match?

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.290
I'm not sure if
I'm ready for that.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.790
C'mon dude, it's only
for funsies. Just one game.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.210
Are you sure?

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.460
Who'd expect anything
professional from you, anyway,

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:20.800
so no pressure.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.050
They're totally
underestimating us here!

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.260
No, I really do kinda suck.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.600
Shall we go ahead
and split into teams?

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.890
[SASAMOTO laughing]

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.140
[ALL]
Huh...?

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.810
They can't even beat us
when it's 5 against 3!

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.690
But do you expect from
a team of middle-schoolers?

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.110
Whoa, ease up, bro!

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.110
You jerks.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.440
What're they doing
playing against

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.990
a bunch of little children?

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.320
Pretty cringe if you ask me.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.570
Where do you old losers
get off messing with people

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.950
half your age just for
the fun of it, huh?

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.830
Don't you have a
lame college party

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.290
or something to run off to?

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.330
Aw boo-hoo, are the pathetic
overgrown varsity rejects

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.670
upset that all the pretty
girls keep ghosting them?

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.090
Cry me a river.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.800
--Booo!
--Booooo!

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.880
They may be young,
but those middle-schoolers

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.720
can dish it out as well
as they can take it.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.010
[NARRATOR]
It was highly effective.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.260
[SAKURAI]
They got owned.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.430
[ASAI]
I don't think I can watch this.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.350
[UZAKI]
Is that guy crying?

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.060
Huh?! I'm not crying!
Besides, who the hell are you?

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.320
Watch out! He's unhinged!

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.820
I think he's just
talking loudly.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.780
Let's calm down. We both paid
good money to play here, right?

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.870
How about we try to be a little
more mindful of the space?

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.870
Wha--?! Wait,
it that you, Sakaki?

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.080
[SAKAKI]
Huh?

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.120
You know him?

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:37.750
Uh, nope.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.830
Whaddaya mean 'nope'?
We all hung out

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.630
at the same mixer that the
soccer club held last week!

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.470
Oh right, I remember
going there! Who're you?

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.800
[ALL]
You forgot about us already?

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.930
Sasamoto!

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:51.180
Kawakami!

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.510
Hamada!

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.350
[NARRATOR] Don't bother
memorizing those names.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.600
What the heck?

00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.230
I only went because
they begged me

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:00.650
to go to help with the numbers.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.980
Yeah? So did you end up
running off with all the girls?

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.900
No, way. We split up
at the train station.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:09.990
[SASAMOTO] Oh, is that it?
Then get your ass over here.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.160
Come be sad with us at our
consolation afterparty!

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.700
[SAKAKI]
I don't know.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:18.040
I mean, you don't make it
sound very tempting.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.670
Besides, if you struck out,
it's probably on you.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:21.920
[SASAMOTO groans]

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.500
Did you even make any
effort to accommodate

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:24.800
the ladies that were there?

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.170
[KAWAKAMI groans]

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.840
Cause you do need to actually
let the other person

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.680
talk when you're
having a conversation.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.010
[HAMADA screaming]

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:34.640
[ALL crying]

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.220
[SAKAKI] Apparently all that
bragging about your

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:38.230
silly little club
bored them to tears.

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:40.020
[GROUP]
Okay, we get it!

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.650
[ASAI]
His words cut deep.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.860
[UZAKI]
Who knew he could be so savage?

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.980
That guy sure roasts my nut.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:49.360
I can't believe we got schooled
so hard by such an average joe!

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.820
And yet as soon as I said
Sakaki would be there

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.080
suddenly the hotties
showed up real fast!

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:58.370
But the worst thing is the way
you're flaunting those cuties!

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.410
[KAWAKAMI]
Both of them are total babes!

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.500
[HAMADA]
It isn't fair, bro!

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.750
See, it's not great when
you say that stuff out loud.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:09.170
But it's totally okay
when you're doing it?

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
Let's duke it out!
We'll go for 20 minutes.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.010
If you win, then your
time here today's on us,

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.850
but if we defeat you...

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.480
Uh, well, we'd
really appreciate it

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.940
if you'd introduced us
to your friends.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.190
[ASAI]
What? Is that it?

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.940
Oki-doke. The pipsqueak
is off limits,

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.820
but you can try your
luck with the other.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.030
[GROUP]
Okay!

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:32.910
[UZAKI, ASAI]
Huh?!

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:34.410
What a rotten deal!

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:35.620
Who ya callin' pipsqueak?

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.240
Wait, what am I,
chopped liver or somethin'?

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.330
Actually, you two can
just sit back and relax.

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:44.040
We'll recruit a middle-schooler
for our goalie.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:48.340
[SAKAKI] It'll be fine. I got
a few tricks up my sleeve.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.510
[BOYS]
So cool!

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.260
Just a few tricks, eh?

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:01.230
So that's why he was so
quick to take up that bet.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.690
And then there's Sakurai.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:04.810
[laughs]

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.360
What're you doin', slowpoke?

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.650
Wake up those legs
and kick that ball!

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.530
[UZAKI]
Keep it up big guy!

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:14.150
You're killing it out there!

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.740
[ASAI] This game sure brings out
the cheerleader in you, huh?

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:22.000
[SASAMOTO] Sakaki's incredible.
Why didn't he join the club?

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.710
This dude is somethin' else.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.500
He's really starting to get
on my nerves, the prick.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:27.420
Hold on.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.840
Stop laughing at me...

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.880
[SASAMOTO] They've got a
weakness. Take him down first.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.630
We gotta score at
least once before it's over!

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.640
Even if we lose, we can
do that much, right?

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.510
We're so done.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:42.310
[SAKAKI]
Saku.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:43.640
[SAKURAI]
Hm?

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:46.270
We're up by quite a bit,
so you can relax.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:48.650
I appreciate it, but
I've barely even helped.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.230
Why am I here?

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.240
No need to pull anything flashy
with those legs of yours.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.650
If the ball comes your way,

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.320
just keep running and kick
it towards the goal, okay?

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:00.330
Copy that.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:04.500
[SAKURAI] That's right.
Don't think about it.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:08.590
All you have to do is
concentrate on the goal.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.210
[SAKURAI]
Yes, focus.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.090
Don't get distracted
by anything else.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.350
[SAKURAI]
Keep your eyes on the ball!

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:22.680
[UZAKI]
Hm? Sakurai's face...

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:26.390
It looks...

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.730
...like it did in high school.

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:30.230
[gasps]

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:36.570
[SAKAKI]
Here it comes!

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:38.450
That ball is mine!

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:41.870
[SAKURAI]
Now's your chance. Go time!

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:43.330
[SAKAKI]
Do it!

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:47.540
[SAKURAI yelling]

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:48.670
[SASAMOTO gasps]

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.090
[SAKURAI growls]

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.760
[SAKURAI]
Wind back... and kick!

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:05.560
[ASAI gasping]

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.390
[KAWAKAMI gasping]

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:12.360
[SAKURAI]
Last one!

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.730
[HAMADA gasping]

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.610
[HAMADA groans]

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:24.580
[SAKURAI panting]

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:31.960
I did it. Goal! [laughs]

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.420
Huh?

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:50.600
Right. Run for your life!

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:52.360
[GROUP]
Huh?!

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.770
[SAKAKI]
You kids can go home now!

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.770
[ALL]
Aw!

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.110
You sure about this, man?

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:59.610
About what? We won,
so it's time to go home!

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.200
Don't you think
giving concussions

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.870
to the other team was overkill?

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.990
Hey, that was a coincidence!

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.410
[STUDENT C]
That was amazing.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:07.830
[STUDENT D]
Right?

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:10.580
[STUDENT A] That guy's a beast--
a god of destruction!

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.130
[SAKURAI growls]

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:14.170
[NARRATOR] And thus,
before he even knew it,

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:18.300
Sakurai became a minor legend
of the local futsal court.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.920
[ASAI] Sure nothing "steamy"
went down back there,

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:24.550
but it was still a hot
day on the field! [laughs]

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.020
[UZAKI]
Wow, you went all out, huh?

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.230
[SAKURAI]
Sure did!

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:34.940
I got pretty good at making udon

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.900
after your mom
gave us that lesson.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.570
[UZAKI] She's been looking
forward to trying yours out.

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:43.320
[TEEN B]
Wait! Slow down, will you?

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:45.580
If we don't hurry, we're
gonna be late, dummy!

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:46.990
[UZAKI]
Huh?

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.170
[UZAKI]
What's up, Sakurai!

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.380
[growls]

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.960
Why the awful expression
this morning?

00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.800
You always make it
point to start

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.970
the day off looking
that miserable?

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.760
Cause that mug of yours
is giving off

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.390
an especially
villainous vibe today!

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.140
The world's most
annoying upperclassman.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.850
I see you continue to be
as irritating as ever.

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:13.100
What was that?

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:15.440
Are you trying to be
funny, big guy?

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.980
[UZAKI]
So frickin' rude!

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:21.150
And here I am looking out for my
miserable loner of a friend.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.400
Are you aware that your
ungrateful behavior

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.240
is a deeply inappropriate
way to treat

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.160
your considerate and
beautiful classmate?

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.830
So? I never asked for your help.

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:32.040
All the more reason
to act grateful.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.670
You're getting affection from
the kindness of my heart!

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.710
Is it kindness when you're
demanding something in return?

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:40.000
Ha! Do you know
how petty you sound

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:43.340
sweating over details like that?
You and your meathead brain,

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.470
always trying to think
of ways to trip me up!

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.550
Really? Do you know
how you sound

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.970
gabbing away like your speech
center's made of Swiss cheese?

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.480
You and your big mouth,
always open.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.690
Watch your tongue!

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:56.860
Yeah, okay. Whatever.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.360
What do you want me
to say instead?

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.690
That you might be built small,
but your heart's real big?

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.650
Guess you're right, I should
be more grateful, huh?

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.070
All right, enough trash talk!
It's punishment time!

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.490
Wha--

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.000
How many times have I told
you to lay off my height?

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.500
Hey, you're choking me.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.040
You don't get to boss me around

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.210
just because you've got
a few inches on me!

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.170
Wait, I need to
tell you something!

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.750
If you're trying to apologize,
it's too late!

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.300
Actually, it's way more urgent.

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.550
Then quit crying and
spit it out already!

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:28.300
It's just that you're
kinda rubbing up

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:30.600
against my face a little.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.470
[UZAKI screaming]

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:36.390
Who's to say I'm not doing it on
purpose? Maybe I'm being nice!

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.150
What, you can't handle
gettin' a little love

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:39.860
from your ol' pal Uzaki?

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.400
[SAKURAI]
I don't understand,

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.190
are you punishing me or are
you showing me affection?

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.150
Make up your mind!

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.530
[UZAKI]
Shut up and take it!

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:49.030
[SAKURAI screams]

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.490
[NARRATOR]
Both options were the same.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.200
[SAKURAI]
You good? You're blushing.

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:55.540
[gasping]

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:59.080
No, I am not. Quit being
so annoying! Just drop it!

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:01.290
[SAKURAI]
Uh, all right?

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:05.050
C'mon, my mom's waiting
for us, so let's get going!

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:06.510
'Kay.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.390
[slurping]

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.430
Nice work.
They came out delicious!

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:14.890
Glad to hear it.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:16.850
Seriously, if you
keep working at it,

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:19.980
you could be a master
chef someday, Sakurai!

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.610
Nah, I'm a scrub.

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:25.990
See, I've only made udon.
I brought the extras, too.

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:28.070
[TSUKI]
That's a ton!

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:31.070
At some point it became way
more fun to make than eat.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.830
Well, I suppose when there's
a will there's a way, right?

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.330
You were able to
train yourself by

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:38.040
focusing solely
on a single recipe.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.420
U-don't say!

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.130
Knock it off with
the dad jokes, you!

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.840
I am getting sick
of noodles though,

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.750
so I was maybe wondering
if you wouldn't mind

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.590
teaching me how to
make something else?

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:49.220
It would be my pleasure.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.800
Hold up, you can't move
on to another dish yet!

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:55.100
Huh? And why would that be?

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.230
Huh? You don't know the reason?

00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:59.390
I mean I could tell you, but
I don't think you're ready.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.110
[SAKURAI]
Ugh, just spit it out!

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:03.900
[UZAKI]
Look, see this?

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.480
No matter how well
you knead your dough,

00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:08.530
if you cut it wrong,
it's ruined.

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:11.240
They need to be sliced to the
same thickness so they all

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:15.540
finish cooking at the
exact same time, duh!

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:19.250
These noodles are defective, and
I declare them unfit for eating!

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.790
[SAKURAI yelling]

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:25.090
[TSUKI]
As you stuff your face...

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.300
Are you starting to
get the picture now?

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.380
You can't call yourself
an udon master

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:31.260
if this is the garbage
you're cranking out!

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.260
You sorry amateur!

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:35.560
[TSUKI] Why is she talking
down to him like that?

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.020
Weren't they supposed
to be friends?

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:42.390
You're absolutely right. I can't
move on till these are perfect.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.230
I must learn. Please teach me
the right knife technique.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.190
That's more like it, chef!

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.820
[TSUKI]
I'm happy to.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.950
But in the meantime, won't you
end up getting even more

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.330
sick of noodles than
you already are now?

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:56.620
U-don't even know!

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.910
Enough food puns!

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:04.040
Show me how you
usually cut them.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:06.420
[TSUKI]
Ah, I see.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:07.840
[SAKURAI]
Huh?

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.800
Can you try taking a step back
on your right-hand side?

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.130
[SAKURAI]
Like this?

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.130
[TSUKI]
Maybe a little more like this...

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:15.930
[TSUKI gasps]

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:19.930
Oopsie! Sorry about that, dear.
I got in your personal bubble!

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.350
[TSUKI]
This isn't good.

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:25.360
I totally forgot, Sakurai
may be Hana's boyfriend,

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.530
but he also has dangerous
designs for her mother. For me!

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:32.360
[NARRATOR]
Tsuki Uzaki, 43 years of age,

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:36.070
had magnificently
misread the situation.

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:39.910
[gasping]

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:42.870
[UZAKI]
Look at him concentrate.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.330
Sakurai throws himself
into whatever he does

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.500
and gets right into the zone.

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.630
He doesn't react to anything
when he's like this,

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:51.510
which is great for pranking him.

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:53.220
[TSUKI]
He doesn't?

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.970
[UZAKI]
Aw, what a shame.

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:01.060
This would've been the
perfect opportunity, too.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.850
[TSUKI]
W-Would it?

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:06.560
[UZAKI]
C'mon, let's go sit.

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:08.900
[TSUKI]
Right. Now's my chance!

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:12.530
I must mend this messed-up
relationship at once!

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:16.070
[NARRATOR]
Little did Tsuki Uzaki know,

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.990
she was the one
who was "messed up."

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.870
[TSUKI]
Say, Hana?

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:22.410
[UZAKI]
Huh?

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:26.830
[TSUKI] I'll start with her.
I should go about this gently.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.210
I was wondering,

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:31.550
how have things been between
you and Sakurai lately?

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:32.760
What does that mean?

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.760
Oh, nothing in particular.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.470
Why, has something
unusual happened?

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:38.600
[UZAKI]
Hm?

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:43.390
[gasping]

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:44.430
[UZAKI whimpering]

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.140
[SAKAKI]
Oop, Uzaki woke up first.

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:48.690
[ITO] I'll send you the
pictures later, okay, Hana?

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:51.020
Ohh, or do you prefer
video instead?

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:53.320
Oh no, this is embarrassing!

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.740
Wake up and let go of me
already, you big stupid weirdo!

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.320
[SAKURAI grumbles]

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.490
[NARRATOR] A collision of
two separate coincidences.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.450
The daughter,
who wondered how Mom

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.750
found out about
that slumber party.

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:09.670
And the mother,
who for better or worse,

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:13.090
happened to be prying
for something else.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:17.800
[UZAKI]
But how? Who told her?

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.590
Have you seen these yet?

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.850
[CAFÉ OWNER] Mm?
You won't believe what I heard.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.850
[ASAI gasps]
Ma'am, you gotta see this!

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:28.060
[UZAKI]
Is that how she found out?

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:31.270
[NARRATOR] It was a sad
chain of misunderstandings.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:37.650
[exhales] What could I do?
It's just a habit of his.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.870
[TSUKI]
A habit, as in a fetish?

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:45.120
We probably shouldn't have let
anyone at school see us, though.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.410
[TSUKI]
See them? At school?

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.750
[UZAKI]
Plus, it's all on video, too.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.710
[TSUKI]
They recorded it?

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:55.010
I-I tried to get up, but
Sakurai just wouldn't let me go.

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:57.010
[TSUKI]
One round wasn't enough?

00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:01.090
And it was such a big mess.
Big mess... Big mess...

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.180
[TSUKI] I can't believe they've
already taken things that far.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.850
If only I'd been
more strict with her..

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.350
...this never would
have happened!

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:16.320
[TSUKI] Hana, I'm going to go
lie down now. Mommy's tired.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.650
Okay, have a good nap.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:22.530
[NARRATOR] Having hurt only
herself with her delusions,

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:27.660
Tsuki Uzaki's days of anguish
would continue a bit longer.

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:30.460
[sighs] I did it.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:33.420
[NARRATOR] The noodles
were perfectly sliced.

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:40.630
Aw nuts, not udon
for dinner again!

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.720
Yeah, one of my friends
made way too much.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.930
Wait one of your friends
nooded up these noods?

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:55.820
Ha, don't mind if I do then!

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.480
[NARRATOR]
And just like that,

00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:00.530
another misunderstanding
was born.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:04.370
[KIRI] Meals prepared by college
girls are the freakin' best!

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:06.490
[UZAKI]
Wow, he's hungry.

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:07.740
[YANAGI]
I'm home!

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:10.620
[UZAKI]
Uh? Hey, Yanagi.
