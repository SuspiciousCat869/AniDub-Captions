WEBVTT

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.310
[NARRATOR] While on a
rare visit to see his family,

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.230
Sakurai walked through the door
to an unexpected surprise.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.190
I leave home for two freaking
years and now I have a sister?

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.150
[NARRATOR] The origin of
his solitary lifestyle

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.400
came to light.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.940
I figured it was high
time for us to relive

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.520
our newlywed days.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.280
You suck, old man.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.570
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Ami and
Sakaki invited Uzaki

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.360
out for drinks.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.910
Not to change the subject,
but I've always been curious

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.870
to learn what you were
like back in high school.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.700
You wanna give us the backstory?

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.040
[UZAKI]
Huh?

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.090
[UZAKI]
Another swim lesson, huh?

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.060
How many times has
Sakurai stayed after

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.180
practice to keep coaching me?
Probably a bunch.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.020
[UZAKI gasps]

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.270
Well, how's my form looking?
Any better?

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.850
[SAKURAI] Hm... Honestly, you're
only doing slightly better

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.530
than you were when you started.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.200
But hey, at least you've
stopped sinking.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.700
Aw, really?

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.660
[SAKURAI] Listen carefully,
when you're doing the crawl

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.950
you gotta go "fwoosh"
before you follow through.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.070
What now?

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.330
"Fwoosh", like you're
a sea turtle.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.830
I'm confused. Wasn't I
fwooshing just now?

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.580
What you were doing was
"splooshing." Ya see?

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.550
How is that different
from what I did?

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.340
Seems like "splooshing" is the
same technique as "fwooshing."

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.710
[SAKURAI]
It's not.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.470
A proper fwoosh
looks like that.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.180
And when you sploosh,
it looks like this.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.600
Do you get the difference now?

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.850
Absolutely not. You lost
me five minutes ago.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.350
[SAKURAI]
Hmm, that's no good.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.600
There's gotta be a better
way to explain it, right?

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.110
Lemme think a sec.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.730
Can I say something?

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:09.980
Sure. What's up?

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.950
Actually, never mind,
it's nothing.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.620
Probably having a brain fart.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:14.610
You sure?

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.280
Look, forget about it.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.860
It might come off awkward
if I mention it now.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.870
It's no big deal.
Go ahead, tell me.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.370
Do you promise you won't
take this the wrong way?

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.240
Yep. You have my word.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.250
So I had this funny
realization about you.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.710
[SAKURAI]
Mm-hm.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.670
Around the third or fourth
time you offered to help me

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.630
with swimming lessons, I started
having distracting thoughts.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.140
[SAKURAI]
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.220
I noticed how awesome you are.
It's actually beautiful

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.140
seeing the way you glide
through the water.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.640
[SAKURAI]
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.140
But despite all your skill,

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.270
you're really not a great
teacher at the end of the day.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.520
[sobs]

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.020
Hey, I'm sorry! It's not that
I mean to sound ungrateful,

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.360
since you've been going out
of your way to support me!

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.690
[SAKURAI sighs]
Honestly, it's okay.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.660
You're not exactly wrong, so
hearing it's hardly a surprise.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.160
I'm sorry.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.490
I wish I had more experience
making sense of this stuff.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.170
I've never had to
mentor someone before.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.710
Huh? Not even the newbies?

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.460
They'd love to learn from you.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.710
[SAKURAI] Maybe, but it hasn't
happened yet and everyone

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.140
who joined this year already
had swim experience.

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.550
[UZAKI]
Right. Guess that checks out.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.380
[SAKURAI] Besides, I didn't
start swimming until

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.970
my freshman year.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.180
[UZAKI gasps] Are you serious?
And you're already that fast?

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.060
[SAKURAI] I was pretty hopeless
at first, but now I'm beginning

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.810
to understand how lucky I was
to have great mentors back then.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.320
It's not easy to
coach other people.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.820
[UZAKI]
Oh yeah? So what about me?

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.320
If it's such a headache
to do all that,

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.400
then why are you even bothering?

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.200
[SAKURAI] Because it'd be
too dangerous to leave you

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.490
on your own.
You're the club manager.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.330
I can't stand by and
not lend a hand.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.160
[UZAKI]
Hm.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.710
[SAKURAI]
In any case,

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.790
I might only have a year of
doggie paddling under my belt,

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.550
but I can still
keep an eye on you.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.590
Don't you worry. I won't
let you drown on my watch.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:59.880
[UZAKI]
Mm.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.350
[UZAKI] You know, you're a
real nice guy, Sakurai.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.100
[SAKURAI]
I am?

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.470
For the longest time I thought
you were so intimidating

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.520
and unapproachable,
'cause of your eyes!

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.350
[grunts]

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.400
Oh crap, I said something
that made you upset!

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.610
I'm sorry, are you insecure
about your face?

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:18.940
Well, I kind of am.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.280
I get that a lot, but I
won't hold it against you.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.200
[UZAKI]
So, I was wondering.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.780
You said you only started
swimming in high school, right?

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.960
Did you play any sports
in middle school?

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.880
[SAKURAI] I was on the
baseball team for a while,

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.630
but I quit after a year.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.550
I wasn't in any
clubs after that.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.050
[UZAKI]
No? Why not?

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.050
[SAKURAI] I dunno. Maybe they
just weren't my thing.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.510
[UZAKI]
Is that so?

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.380
Then since you didn't stick
around long you never had

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.390
the chance to mentor anyone
other than me, right?

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.970
Huh. In a way I suppose that
makes you my first protégé,

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.520
I mean, as far as
swim club's concerned.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.690
Oh, wow. Well, that's a
neat coincidence.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.860
And on that note, I'm ready to
get a little more practice in.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.690
[SAKURAI]
Oh, okay. Sounds good.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.830
[SAKAKI]
After everything you've told us,

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.790
a lotta things make sense.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.500
Yeah I know right?
No freakin' kidding.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.290
When it comes to sports,
Sakurai's terrible at relying

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.120
on anything that
isn't his own body.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.380
Basically, the more distance he
has to cover with a ball or bat,

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.710
the worse he performs.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.510
But he's got strength and
stamina up the wazoo,

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.220
which makes him incredible
at solo stuff like running,

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.300
swimming, and rock-climbing.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.600
I wasn't referring to sports,
I was talking about you two--

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.770
What a weirdo.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.600
Maybe it's cause of his
natural loner ways,

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.400
but he's hopeless when it
comes to team activities.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.480
He said he made a big
mistake choosing to join

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.320
the baseball team and that it
all went downhill from there.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.900
[SAKAKI]
This is perfect.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.660
We gotta keep her talking while
she's still nice and plastered.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.990
Don't wanna break the flow
by killing the mood.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.490
Which means...

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.250
...Ami's gonna need to
pull it together before

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:52.580
Uzaki gets suspicious.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.620
Ugh, could you try looking
less thirsty, please?

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.550
And wipe off that drool!

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:00.970
Know what, Hana?

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.260
[UZAKI]
Hm?

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:04.720
[ASAI] Tonight's drinks
are gonna be on me,

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.930
so go ahead drink up.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.300
'Cause life is short and
you only live once!

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.020
Waiter, bring us
another pitcher!

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.730
[UZAKI]
Time to get crunk!

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.850
Bet you'll regret
this in the morning.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.890
[gasps]

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.650
Your name was Nodoka,
wasn't it?

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:22.730
Not that it hurts much,

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.110
but could you stop
doing that please?

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.150
It's not very polite to stretch
people's cheeks out

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.830
without consent.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.370
[SHIRO]
Aw, would you look at that.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.040
The two of you are practically
getting along like siblings!

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.750
Which makes sense,
since you are.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.500
Who knew you were
great with kids?

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.170
I'm feeling like there's
a lot more to it

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.460
than being able to hold one.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.040
[SHIRO] You're such
a lucky girl, Nodoka!

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.970
You've got a big stwong bwover
who wants to pway with you,

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.640
don't you?

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.180
No more pictures.
You're gonna clog your phone.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:51.680
[SHIRO] Be a good boy and
keep your face turned

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.140
towards the camera.
I'll send these to you later.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.510
You don't have to
do that, you know.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.230
Quit your bellyaching.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.900
If you shut your trap and
behave, I'll play with you, too.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.360
[SAKURAI]
U-Uh?

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.820
[SHIRO]
Things could get sweaty.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.030
Might as well have fun
before bath time.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.780
[SAKURAI grunts]

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.860
[SHIRO] Now then, it's been
quite a while, hasn't it?

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.740
[SHIRO] Why don't we spar for
a bit and see how rusty

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.500
you are these days?

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.920
Come over here and
show me what you got!

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.790
[SAKURAI grunts]

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:24.540
[grunts]

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.510
[grunts]

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:31.590
[HARUKO gasps]
Ooh!

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.390
Look at you scurrying around
like a little chipmunk!

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.650
Let's hope they finish up
their roughhousing

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.570
before our dinner gets cold.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.650
[SAKURAI grunts]

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.030
[gasps] Finally, I've got him.
Now's my chance!

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.330
[SAKURAI]
You're done, old man!

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.160
[gasps]

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.960
[SHIRO]
Hm. You don't let up, do you?

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.710
[SHIRO] His footwork hasn't
changed much since high school,

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.640
but his upper body strength
has vastly improved.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.510
His movement is quicker, too.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.590
He must've started
hitting the gym again.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.850
[SHIRO]
Very well.

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:16.640
[SAKURAI gasps]

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.930
[grunts]

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.310
[grunts]

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:21.350
[SAKURAI]
Crap!

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.230
[SHIRO shouts]

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.490
[grunts]

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.450
I could tell you were desperate
to take the advantage

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:30.410
as soon as you could
see an opening.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:32.030
That's a bad habit of yours.

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:33.070
[SAKURAI groans]

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.910
Stay two moves ahead
of your opponent

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:36.870
and make sure you
maintain your focus.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:38.990
If you lose your cool,
it's over.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.370
You're still in fighting shape,

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.590
and you did manage to avoid
falling on your face.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:44.090
I'll give you that much.

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.840
But you definitely can't
stay competitive

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.260
if you overlook your training.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.220
Come back any time and
I'll gladly play with you.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.220
Funny you should say that
considering how you were

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.510
the jerk who tried to keep
me exiled, remember?

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.400
Did I? That doesn't sound
like something I would do.

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:00.310
What a wild imagination.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:04.270
Has anyone ever told you
you can be a real shit?

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.810
Even the clothes you're
wearing are obnoxious.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.150
What kind of idiot puts on a
hakama for judo practice?

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.910
It looks pretty cool, yeah?

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.120
I should've known you
were playing dress up.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.200
'Cause for a minute there,

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.910
I almost thought you'd
taken up aikido.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:20.160
We're wearing them at the dojo.
It's our new thing.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:21.380
[SAKURAI]
So where's mine?

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:22.450
You don't get one.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.790
Doesn't that make
you feel jealous?

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.290
It actually does, dammit.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.460
Then why don't
you get back up

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.250
and do something
about it tough guy?

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.380
I want you to try to beat
me at least once before I

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.090
throw you another ten times.
Otherwise, I'll make you spill

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.210
about that mystery
girl of yours.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.510
Best get your game face
on before you gotta sing!

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.810
How many times do I have to
spell it out, you nosy creep?

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.560
She literally isn't
my girlfriend!

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.560
You're acting way defensive for
someone with nothing to hide.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.310
If you aren't involved
with her like that,

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.610
then would you care to explain
what she was doing at your place

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:49.820
so late at night when I called?

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.190
[gasps]

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.820
Did she stay over?

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.820
Why does it matter to you?

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:58.410
Because there are certain steps
a relationship needs to take

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:00.080
before you get intimate.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.490
I'm not sure what
you're imagining,

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.330
but there is definitely
no intimacy!

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.540
Either way, it's apparent
that she's the type of lady

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.580
who's very comfortable
taking casual showers

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.210
at your apartment
for some reason.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.800
What are you getting at?

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.470
She just has a few quirky
little habits like anybody else

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.300
and there's nothing
wrong with that.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.380
Not that it's any of
your business,

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.430
but for your information
the reason she comes over

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:22.800
is because she worries about me!

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:25.230
I've looked out for her
ever since swim club.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.600
So she's just
returning the favor!

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:30.990
--[SAKURAI] Father!
--[SHIRO] You ignorant fool!

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:33.360
To think that my son could
be so utterly clueless!

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.320
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.530
[SAKURAI groans]
Didn't see that coming.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.330
[SHIRO]
Why are you making me do this?

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:42.950
Think, boy. If you don't
do things right,

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.500
folks'll get the wrong
idea about her!

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.370
[SHIRO] Looks like he's
finally getting the picture.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.880
But I won't let him
off the hook yet.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.460
[SHIRO]
Hey, we aren't finished here.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.580
Hurry up and get on your feet so
I can wrestle some more secrets

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.300
out of you. Come on
now froggy, jump!

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.840
Are you out of your mind?
We've been waiting for ages!

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.430
Get cleaned up so we
can eat already.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.010
It smells like sweat and
shattered dreams in here.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.980
Unbelievable, now I'll
have to reheat the food.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.150
Ugh! Honestly, grow up!

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:14.360
Thanks to your mom, it seems
you're free to live another day.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.070
That woman may have
just popped out a baby,

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.950
but she can still knock
the wind outta my sails.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.030
Let this be a reminder not
to get on her nerves, okay?

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.160
[SAKURAI grunts]

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.370
[UZAKI]
You know what, Ami?

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:27.490
I've learned something
valuable today.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.960
After a night of partying,

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.920
you cannot underestimate the
importance of hydration.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.840
Hydrate before you die-drate!

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.550
Slow down.
You're gonna choke, sweetie!

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:40.800
[YANAGI]
Yeesh, talk about embarrassing.

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.060
Thanks a bunch for making sure
my daughter made it back

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.060
in one piece, but are you
gonna make it home okay?

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.770
Oh don't worry
about me, Mrs. Uzaki.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.810
I've got a nice warm
taxi waiting for me.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.070
And the best part is, I'm not
paying for a single penny of it!

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.240
That sounds wonderful, Ami.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.530
Well, enjoy the rest
of your evening then!

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:00.320
[YANAGI]
Hey, Ami. Wait up a sec.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.700
Oh, hi. How's it
hangin', Yanagi?

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.490
[YANAGI] Did I miss any
spicy developments

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.460
between Hana and
her boytoy tonight?

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.380
That partypooper didn't
end up joining us,

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.840
so there's nothing
new to report.

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:11.450
That's disappointing to hear.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.670
But I did make the most
of it and enjoy myself,

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:17.460
even if it did mean retreating
into my imagination! Ha, ha!

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:18.720
[YANAGI]
I like this girl,

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.470
but I wish she'd ease up
on the thirst sometimes.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.090
What's got you curious anyway?

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.560
Oh, I'm just checking in.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.930
Gotta keep an eye
on my sis, after all.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.480
Ah! Nothing like a
big chug of wa-wa.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.810
[SAKURAI]
Gah, everything hurts.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.070
[sighs]

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.950
This is such a mess.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:42.070
[SHIRO]
If you don't do things right,

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.040
folks'll get the
wrong idea about her!

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.250
--[sighs]
--[door opens]

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.420
[SHIRO chuckles]

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.750
[SHIRO] Hello, my son.
Got room for daddy?

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:56.170
[SAKURAI]
Uhh.

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:58.130
[SHIRO]
C'mon now, don't be shy.

00:13:58.210 --> 00:13:59.880
Relax, Shinichi.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.380
We used to bathe together
all the time, remember?

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:04.850
[SAKURAI]
Get outta here, you weirdo!

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.770
[HARUKO]
Eat up!

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:15.600
You haven't had my cooking
in almost two years,

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.030
so consider this your chance
to make up for lost time!

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.030
[SAKURAI] How am I supposed
to finish all that rice?

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.400
Your mother's showing you
how much she loves you.

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:25.120
Now quit complaining
and dig in already, kid!

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:27.490
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Interesting.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.830
So you and Sakurai
go to the same gym.

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:31.410
And when I asked him
where he worked,

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.790
I was shocked when he said
it was at your café.

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.710
It certainly is a small world.

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:38.630
I get the impression you've
known each other for a while.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.710
Me and Imura were in the
same year at school.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.140
And the sandwiches he makes?

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.470
They're prepared with
bread from my bakery.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:47.140
Although it's been a bit since
I've stopped by in person.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.220
We go way back,
as you kids say.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:50.600
That's nice to hear.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:51.720
Speaking of friendship,

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:53.440
you're buddies
with Sakurai, aren't you?

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.480
You should join him
at the gym sometime!

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.230
Thanks, I'll think about it.

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:59.940
How bout you, bossman?
I hear your back's been wonky.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.990
Nothing like a brisk workout
to fix things up!

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:03.820
Is that so?

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.320
I suppose it could be quite fun,
exercising with pals.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:08.580
We'll be waiting for you.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.080
Sakurai took to training
like a fish to water.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.750
[IMURA chuckles] Always ready
with the sales pitch.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.210
Oh, by the way,

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.250
not to speak of the devil
while his back's turned,

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:21.630
but is there a reason that boy
keeps cleaning that one spot?

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:22.750
[SAKAKI]
Don't mind him.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.220
He's been doing
that a lot lately.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:25.590
[CAFÉ OWNER]
He's at that age.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.140
Kids these days have the
world on their shoulders.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.350
[CAFÉ OWNER] Still though,
it does look like it's

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.640
weighing down
heavier than usual.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.400
I need to get going.
I've gotta work a shift later.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.650
I know you're busy, but don't
forget to take care of yourself.

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.820
Right, I'll try to.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:48.650
And I promise to come
visit more often, as well.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.240
I still need to take down
the old man at least once

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:52.710
before I graduate.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:55.920
Yeah okay, whatever you say.
You know where to find me.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.590
[grunt, laughs]

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:01.420
[NODOKA coos]

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:05.290
Later, Nodoka. You be good!

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.180
Don't forget.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
Make sure you do
right by that girl.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:13.310
[SAKURAI]
Tsk. You ain't slick.

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:15.770
What was that all about?

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.730
[SHIRO]
Nun-ya business!

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:20.900
[SAKURAI] Dad said that trying
to play it cool could end up

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.230
causing problems for
Uzaki down the line.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.160
I never even considered that.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.740
Come to think of it, I might
have already made a mess of this

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:31.860
whole entire situation
without realizing it.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.660
So much for doing
things right by her.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.330
But what does that even mean?

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:38.750
And what I need to do
to make it happen?

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.330
I don't have a clue.

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:41.590
You okay?

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.510
[SAKURAI]
Huh? Yeah, I'm fine.

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:45.010
You sure?

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:46.930
Because you've been looking
miserable since I walked in.

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:50.100
Sorry about that. I've had
a lot on my mind lately.

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.350
Too many complicated feelings.

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.060
I know what's bothering you.

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.350
Is it about that girl you
mentioned a while back?

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:57.560
[ALL gasp]

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.230
To be honest, I'm a
little upset, Sakurai.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:03.230
We would've been more than glad
to listen if you needed advice.

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:06.020
Especially since we're the ones
who've known you longer.

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:07.820
[SAKURAI]
It's not about you two!

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.570
And that's not what
this is anyway.

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:11.530
I wasn't asking for advice,
and in fact,

00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:13.490
I wasn't saying anything at all.

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:16.170
Fuji took a wild guess
and read me like a book.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.870
Believe me, I wasn't trying
to leave you guys out

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:19.790
of the loop or whatever.

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:21.250
[CAFÉ OWNER chuckles]

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:23.880
Dude, we're kidding.
Well, sort of.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.250
Give it to me straight.
What's the one thing

00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:28.630
that you ultimately want
from this gal, kiddo?

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.140
I'm not sure I follow.

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.470
You looking for a girlfriend?
A lover to warm your bed?

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.640
Perhaps a faithful companion?

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.260
You do realize
those descriptions

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:38.730
are all pretty much alike.

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:41.020
Are you beginning to spiral
because the way it is now

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.900
isn't sparking the same
magic for you anymore?

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.610
And you're desperate to break
out of this slump at any cost?

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:48.780
Not that I would know,
just spit balling here.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:53.280
Uh... Do I not like
the way things are now?

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:56.120
But what am I supposed
to about it?

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.160
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Just take it one step at a time.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.990
[SAKURAI]
Huh?

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.670
[CAFÉ OWNER] The way you resolve
your issue is up to you,

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:05.210
but you might be able to get
there a heck of a lot easier

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:06.960
if you calm down first.

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:09.470
So put your worries
aside for a bit.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:11.890
Then you can figure out
what your goals are.

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.720
[SAKURAI] My goals?
I haven't thought of any.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.010
Well, now's your
opportunity to set one.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.140
What do you see as the
best possible outcome

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:23.680
for your situation?
Try mulling it over for a while.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:26.480
And don't forget, if there's
ever a problem too hard to solve

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.190
on your own, you can always lean
on the people around you.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.370
Lucky for you, you've got
plenty of friends who're

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:34.950
more than happy to lend
you a little help.

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:38.740
And why not? You're a
good man, Shinichi Sakurai.

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:40.960
So don't hesitate
to be a little needy.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.580
I'm sure no one would mind

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.550
R-Really, Boss?

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:48.670
Thanks!

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:50.960
[SAKAKI]
Hmph. Didn't expect that.

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:53.260
Someone went in with
the encouragement.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.590
Though I thought your M.O
was to not get involved.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.680
[CAFÉ OWNER laughs]
What can I say?

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.680
The poor boy just
seemed so lost.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.510
I figured I'd make an exception.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.270
Nothing wrong with
a gentle push.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:04.850
A gentle push?

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.230
You should shove him around more
often as far as I'm concerned.

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:09.600
I hate to admit it, but I
was moved back there!

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:10.820
You're amazing!

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.110
[IMURA] Woof, I would
not wanna work here.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:14.940
Oh, goodness, you flatter me.

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:18.320
Still though, I do rather resent
having my moment stolen

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:20.660
by a certain someone
out of the blue.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.120
[SAKAKI]
Yeah, I don't blame you.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.080
You sure are lucky, Sakurai.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.540
When you've got great folks
like these to lift you up,

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:30.000
who even needs to blow off steam
at the gym anymore, ya know?

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:31.550
[IMURA]
This schmuck.

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:35.180
He's acting like he contributed
something to the conversation.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:36.930
[FUJIO]
Listen, big guy.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:39.390
I've noticed that you seem super
down whenever you stop by

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:40.890
to train with the crew.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:42.810
But something tells me things
will be looking up for you

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:45.180
the next time you walk in.

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:46.940
[SAKURAI]
Thanks a bunch, Fuji.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.690
And when I'm ready,
I hope you'll spot me again.

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:51.730
[FUJIO]
Sure!

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:54.070
[SAKURAI] I might not have
everything figured out yet,

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:58.360
but thanks to my friends
I'm starting to feel better.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:01.790
Like the boss man said,
I should think things over.

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.670
[SAKURAI]
Here goes nothing.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:07.000
Uzaki's got a bad habit
of running her mouth,

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.870
but at the end of
the day, she's great.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.250
And she's always been
there for me.

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:15.430
[SAKURAI] It's settled.
I'm gonna thank her

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:18.260
for everything she's done
when I see her today.

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.930
From now on, I'll do my
best to be nice to her.

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:22.850
Or at least not treat
her like a pest.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.220
[UZAKI]
Yo, Sakurai!

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:26.440
Hey, what's up?

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.570
[giggles]

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:31.320
Gosh. It's crazy.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.490
Even though we haven't
been apart for too long,

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:35.110
it feels like it's
been forever.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.150
Yeah, totally.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.620
[SAKURAI] Hm. It looks like
she's in a good mood today.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.330
She's grinning from ear to ear.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.500
If I'm going to thank her,
then I better do it now.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.920
Hey listen. There's something
I wanted to tell you.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.920
[UZAKI] Look pal, I'm sick of
beating around the bush,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.540
so let's cut to the chase.

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:54.050
Sakurai.

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:56.130
You and I both know you don't
have any Christmas plans.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:57.500
[SAKURAI]
Right, but...

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.430
Aww, I feel so bad for you.

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:01.970
When I picture you in your sad
little apartment picking at cold

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:03.890
delivery chicken and sad,
store-bought cake,

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:06.850
it makes me wanna laugh and cry
at the same time! Ha, ha!

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.270
A bunch of my friends invited
me to their holiday party

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:10.850
and it sounds like
it's gonna be a blast,

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:13.780
but I guess I wouldn't mind
turning them down for you.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.360
And if you ask me really
really nicely, I might even

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.530
be convinced to brave the
winter cold and come hang out

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:19.860
with you for the night instead.

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:21.990
Man, what would you do
without a nice girl like me

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:23.660
to take pity on you?

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.780
Well, you wouldn't be spending
Christmas with this hottie.

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:27.750
Are you sure you wanna miss out
on your big chance here?

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:29.330
You best be careful.

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:31.500
It might not come again for the
rest of your life, so hurry up.

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.040
Let's make some memories!

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.550
[SAKURAI]
On second thought, never mind.

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:36.800
She's the worst.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.590
So whaddaya say, loner boy?

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.050
[SAKURAI] I want you to stop
inviting yourself over.

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:43.300
Uh! Wait, where's this
coming from?

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:46.020
It's from you throwing nonstop
insults at me out of nowhere.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:47.690
I don't wanna hear it anymore!

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:49.860
Say it don't spray it--
Hey, come back here!

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:50.770
I'm talking to you!

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:51.930
[SAKURAI]
Quit following me.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.150
[UZAKI] Oh, come on!
What's your problem?

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:54.860
[SAKURAI]
Leave me alone, please.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:58.950
[SAKAKI] Those simpletons.
Why are they like this?

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:04.580
[UZAKI] Open up, Sakurai!
It's cold, let me in already!

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:05.910
You hear me?

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:07.830
[NARRATOR] And just like that,
she was banished.

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:11.080
The hope of a Christmas
miracle grew dimmer.
