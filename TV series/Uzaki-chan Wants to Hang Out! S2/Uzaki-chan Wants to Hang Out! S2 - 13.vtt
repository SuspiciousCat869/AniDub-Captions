WEBVTT

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.100
[FUJIO] Ah, maybe I was wrong
to write off Sakurai.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.730
There's a surprisingly
gentle soul beneath

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.190
that tough exterior. I didn't
realize he was such a softie.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.770
[inaudible]

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.780
[FUJIO] And he's head over
heels for my baby girl.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.950
What a reveal that was.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.740
I guess our plan backfired.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.950
Ah, the poor guy started
spilling his guts.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.960
My old man's somethin' else.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.080
The way him and mom used to
act kinda messed me up.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.500
[FUJIO]
I wonder if he's having trouble

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.710
getting along with his folks?

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.420
Kinda sounds like he
might be going through

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.880
some serious stuff back home.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.930
[SHIRO] Make yourself useful and
get me more booze, dammit!

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.010
[HARUKO]
Please, honey. You'll kill him!

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.810
[FUJIO] I'm still not sure
how I feel about

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.480
him and Hana together.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.860
But maybe I could ease up on him
a little till I figure that out.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.820
Hey everybody, I'm home!

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.900
I thought I'd
top off our snacks.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.440
Huh?!

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.410
What the heck is
going on in here?!

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.280
[SAKURAI grunting]

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.330
[YANAGI] Whoa, relax. There's
no need to manhandle him.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.750
Be careful, Hana.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.670
You don't wanna
hurt Sakurai, do you?

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.210
Okay then,
I'll strip him gently.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.930
What're you all doing?
No more drinking.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.680
We're putting an end
to this right now!

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.690
[NARRATOR]
Approximately half an hour

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.940
before Fujio's return,
the party had devolved.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.770
[laughing]

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.910
Wow, Sakurai, I know you're
totally wasted and all,

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.240
but you suck at card games more
than any other person I know!

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.410
[groans] Whatever,
cards aren't my thing.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:23.990
[UZAKI]
Yeah, that's an understatement.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.330
But I'm still not
gonna go easy on you!

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.040
[YANAGI]
She's such a gremlin!

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.870
Okeydokey, get ready
to eat dirt again!

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.000
Wait, hang on.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.470
What's up?

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.300
Before you set up
for the next round,

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.970
why not try making things
a tad more interesting?

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.140
Up the ante. Ya know,
raise the stakes.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.510
Good idea.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.140
[NARRATOR]
Hana was somewhat inebriated.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.310
Best o' luck!

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.600
[NARRATOR]
Yanagi was sober, of course.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.900
[YANAGI] So, what's
the plan, sis? Strip him?

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.070
[UZAKI]
You know it.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.110
[NARRATOR]
A scandalous idea!

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.740
[UZAKI] Let's get him naked
and take some pics.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.530
We'll sell them to Ami.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.040
I bet she'd pay top dollar
for this sort of stuff.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.540
[YANAGI] Oh, man! Hana's way
more fun when she's sauced!

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.160
This is deplorable.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.170
Where did my daughters pick
up such nasty inclinations?

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.420
I must stop them.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.590
All right.
That's enough of that!

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.090
[FUJIO]
Hey everybody, I'm home!

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.800
I thought I'd
top off our snacks.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.050
[FUJIO gasps]

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.390
[NARRATOR] And that was
what led to this moment.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.100
Hun, care to explain
why he's naked now?

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.220
I know what this looks like,

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.190
but just calm down
and let me explain!

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.810
[FUJIO]
Calm down! Really?

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.400
[TSUKI] All I know is that
Sakurai was indisposed,

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.570
Hana took advantage
of the situation,

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.190
and Yanagi chose to brush
up on her photography.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.120
And as the only adult here you
should've stopped them!

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.700
[TSUKI] I tried, but
everything happened so fast.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.910
So I figured the least I
could do was make sure

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.460
his clothes didn't
end up wrinkled.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.500
[FUJIO] Where are
your priorities, woman?!

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.080
[NARRATOR] Like her,
they were slightly tipped.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.840
Aw, fudge. I still can't
get his pants off.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.550
Hey you, mind lifting your
knees up for a second?

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.510
[SAKURAI grunting]

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.380
[camera shutter clicking]

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.560
No! Cut that out, Yanagi!

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.270
You're gonna scar
that boy's soul

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.310
till it's more broken
than it already is!

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.520
You starting to
sober up there, buddy?

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.140
Uh-huh. You betcha.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.150
[NARRATOR]
In the meantime,

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.690
it seemed Hana
had sobered up, too.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.700
Letting you take the train
is outta the question.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.070
I'll call you a cab.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.830
I appreciate it.
Thanks a lot, sir.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.870
Hey, it's no trouble.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.580
[FUJIO] Besides,
I'm the one who gave you

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.500
too much to drink
in the first place.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.960
We should ride with him
to make sure he's safe.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.750
Would you mind
coming along, Dad?

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.840
I'll need help if this big
lummox passes out on me.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.550
Smart thinking!

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.520
Thanks so much
for having me over.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.100
I hope you enjoyed yourself.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.720
Get home in one piece,
okay, Sakurai?

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.770
[UZAKI] Hey, you're not
gonna vom, are you?

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.600
Dude, I'm not that drunk.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.820
I'm pretty sure
I'm in the clear now.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.530
Rough night, huh?
You still upset with us, Dad?

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.450
[FUJIO grumbles]

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.530
[FUJIO]
Of course I'm not, pumpkin.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.080
And I'm sorry I made such
a ruckus earlier tonight.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.160
[sighs] Sakurai's always
welcome to hang.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.170
There's no need
to be a stranger.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.000
You really mean it?

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.010
Thank you, Fuji.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.850
[FUJIO] I don't know what's
down the road for them,

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.850
but he's a good kid, no doubt.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.730
And as long as he makes
my little girl happy,

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.940
I suppose we're square.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.360
What a relief. We made it
out the other side, son!

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.780
Okay. Sit tight.
I'll be right back.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.620
[UZAKI]
C'mon, sleepyhead. You're home.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.090
You gonna be all right or do you
need me to read you a story?

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.670
No thanks.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:59.920
You sure about that?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.750
Because it looks like
you could really use

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.930
someone to tuck you in,
but okay--

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.300
Man, I suck.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.840
What?

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.640
But I promise I'll shape up.
I'm gonna get my act together

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.100
so I don't wind up being
a bother for you, Hana.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.310
[gasps]

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:17.680
Um.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.910
It's fine. You can bother me
as much as you want.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.590
[SAKURAI gasping]
Uzaki...

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.340
--[thud]
--[UZAKI gasps]

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.010
[UZAKI]
Uh. Sakurai?

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.640
[FUJIO] Hana sure is
taking her sweet time.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.220
Hope everything's okay.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:00.690
[FRIENDS] Kiri. How about we
finish the night at your place?

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.520
Yeah, you're gonna have
to keep it in your pants,

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:04.490
you friggin' horndogs.

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:05.530
Uh?!

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.450
But it's fine if
I come, right, bro?

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:12.280
[KIRI] Uh... Where did those
sparkles come from?

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.210
[UZAKI gasping]

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:17.090
[SAKURAI panting]

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:24.130
[gasps]

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.190
Hey, Sakurai?

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.600
[gasps]

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.730
[exhales] Wow.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:08.260
[UZAKI] Gah. Holy crap,
did that startle me!

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.380
The timing on that fall was like
something out of a movie!

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:12.720
I'm sure it was a coincidence

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.010
since he's never
been aggressive.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.150
But still though,
consider me shook!

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:22.100
So, uh, did you have any
trouble dropping off Sakurai?

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:25.070
[UZAKI] Hm? Well, he ended up
passing out in the hallway,

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.070
so I left him on the
floor with a blanket.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.900
Oh, is that so?
Guess that's not a surprise

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:31.530
since he drank himself
under the table.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:33.490
Yeah, I wonder
whose idea that was.

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.990
[FUJIO gasps]
She saw right through our plan!

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.750
[UZAKI]
Oh crap, I forgot.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.080
We've both got work
at the café tomorrow.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.240
How am I ever gonna

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.460
look him in the eye
after what happened?

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.670
[ASAI laughs]

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.840
[UZAKI growls]

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.010
[UZAKI] It's way too early
for that energy.

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:53.720
Somebody's looking chipper.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.470
What's got you in
such a good mood today?

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.640
[ASAI]
Oh, you know.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.640
How'd you get those?
Yanagi actually sent them?

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:03.230
It's not what you think!

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.690
We just had a few drinks
and goofed off!

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.020
[UZAKI screams]

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.820
Why is my little sister so
skilled at taking lewds?

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.400
All that I wanted was
for the two of you

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.830
to make some precious
yet spicy memories.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:16.330
But I never expected you
to share the racy mementos

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:18.910
of your libidinous activities!

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.660
It's not much, but here!

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.590
[UZAKI] Are you kidding?
She's paying me!

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:26.760
Look Ami, as a future
business owner who wants

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.010
to run her own café someday,
don't you think you should

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.800
put a bit more thought
into how you spend your money?

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.300
Uh! Yeah, you're right.

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.640
You'll need more so you can
give Yanagi her share.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.970
[UZAKI]
Ugh, that's not what I meant!

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.350
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.390
It's not so much about
hoarding your capital

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.570
as it is about
increasing revenue.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:50.650
The key to good business,
is solid investment.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.150
[UZAKI grunts]

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.330
But don't get me wrong, it's
important to be careful with

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.320
your funds so you
don't screw yourself.

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.580
Gotta do your part
to boost the economy.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:01.370
So shelling out your coins for
Sakurai's underwear shots.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:03.790
That's your way of supporting
the capitalist machine?

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.500
Heck yeah, girl!

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.540
[UZAKI] And that's something
you're proud of?!

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:09.880
It sure is when there's a
burgeoning market out there

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.380
and I have the freedom to
spend my dough how I like!

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:13.630
As far as I'm concerned,

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.600
my tastes and my desire
to show my gratitude,

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.520
consider them mutually
exclusive expenditures!

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.890
So take my money!

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.470
That's a very generous
offer, but I can't.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.940
And why did you
just triple the amount?

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.810
[ASAI] That's because I forgot
to include Sakurai's share.

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.320
[UZAKI] I'm not sure he'd
appreciate it either way!

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.030
What's with all
the commotion, guys?

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:34.450
[gasps]

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:37.330
I could hear you both shouting
from around the corner.

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.790
Oh. Sorry about that.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:42.870
Can I ask you something?

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:44.160
[UZAKI]
Uh. Sure.

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.960
[SAKURAI]
Did anything happen last night?

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.960
Because I can't really
remember anything.

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:54.340
Hope I didn't do anything weird.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:57.890
[SAKURAI]
Thought I'd check in to see

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.770
if I made a fool of myself.

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.600
[SAKURAI grunts]

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.020
[ASAI laughs]

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.140
Wait, what the--!

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:08.270
Do you mind explaining
why I'm naked?

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.560
[UZAKI] You're the one
who's in the picture,

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:11.190
why don't you enlighten us?

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:12.900
[UZAKI]
Besides, I was plastered, too.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.570
But I already told you,
I don't remember anything!

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:17.690
Like seriously,
what even is this?

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.370
And why are all these angles
so tastefully specific?

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:22.490
[UZAKI]
Ah, c'mon, not this again.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.580
It was embarrassing for me, too.
How does he think I feel?

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.540
Ugh. On second thought,
maybe I'm actually better off

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.460
not remembering this trauma.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.420
Perhaps it would jog
your memory to reconstruct

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:33.960
the scene by
stripping right here?

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:35.640
Thanks, I'll pass.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.630
[UZAKI growls]

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.010
[CAFÉ OWNER clears throat]
Shall we finish

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.010
getting the café
ready for opening?

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.350
[SAKURAI]
Oh. On it!

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.270
[UZAKI, ASAI]
Yes, sir.

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:49.270
[UZAKI] So he forgot everything.
What can you do?

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.440
All things considered,
that's a bit of a relief.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:56.820
Which means I guess
we're back to normal then.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.280
[UZAKI]
So...

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.650
[SAKURAI]
Hm?

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.780
You making any big
plans for New Year's?

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.620
Well, funny you should ask,
Itsuhito said

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.740
we should all go visit
a shrine together.

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.960
That sounds nice! [laughs]

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.000
Yeah. It sure does.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.630
[SAKURAI] Cool.
I'll go ahead and tell him

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:17.880
to round up the gang then.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.710
[UZAKI]
It's a date!

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:23.760
Well, I guess I'll see ya later.

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:26.190
Have a good night. See ya soon.

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:53.000
[SAKURAI panting]

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.170
[panting continues]

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:17.030
[SAKURAI whimpers] Like there's
any way I could've forgot that.

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:21.070
[UZAKI]
Man, this year shot by

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:22.780
in the blink of
an eye, didn't it?

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.650
I have a decent theory
as to why though.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.490
It's because I spent
so much time with you.

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:27.740
I guess that time
flies when you're

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:31.210
keeping somebody's loner
tendencies in check. Hm?

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.960
What gives, Sakurai? Why are
you staring at me like that?

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.540
Dude, are you spacing out?

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.220
You've been polishing
the same spot

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.330
for the last 25 minutes.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.420
Look, this is our
last shift of the year,

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.350
so try not to fumble
the ball. Kay?

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:49.510
Hey, congrats!
We survived another one.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.600
Well, I suppose I'll
save my Happy New Years

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:56.140
for later when I
see you at the shrine.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:57.690
'Kay.

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:00.400
[SAKURAI grunting]

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.230
[SAKURAI panting]
Aw, man.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.660
[SHIRO]
That was terrible.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.410
You're even less focused
than you were last time.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:11.040
Your moves just now were
all power and no technique.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.790
Like you were ready
to lash out at someone

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:16.460
and you didn't care who it was.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.210
I wonder if something's
been bugging you again.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:21.920
Like last time. Ya know.

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.010
That poor girl who you
managed to drag into

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:27.260
your room when I was
calling you the other day?

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:28.420
[growls]

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:30.510
[SAKURAI]
He's annoying, yet perceptive.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.440
This is why I hate
coming back home!

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.020
[SHIRO] You won't inherit
the dojo doin' stuff like that.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.560
Who said I wanted to?

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.680
I don't have the chops, anyway.

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:40.480
I'm only here because
I wanted to work out

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:42.740
and my gym's closed
for the holidays.

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.610
You bein' fresh with me, son?

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:46.650
Oh well, I suppose it
doesn't exactly come as

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.330
a surprise that you
aren't big on judo.

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:51.450
To be honest, I got this place
from your mom's side

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:54.410
of the family, and I wasn't
too thrilled about it either.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.000
But teaching a
bunch of hyperactive

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.960
little monsters isn't half bad.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.540
It never gets old hearing
them all call you master.

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.380
They must have you confused.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.750
Sure would make your impending
job-hunt a lot easier.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.050
Oh, yeah?

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:08.090
When you put it that way,
it does sound nice.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.180
Too bad we're not
planning to retire yet.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.720
At this rate, you're
never gonna throw me

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:14.730
or your mother with those
aggressive techniques.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:16.520
But if you're looking
to toss a lady around,

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.980
then you might be
on the right track!

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.190
[laughing]

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:20.190
[SHIRO grunts]

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.270
[NARRATOR]
Shiro had just stepped

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.650
on an emotional landmine.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:26.980
[SHIRO grunts] That was actually
a solid sneak attack.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.450
If this is what I'd
have to deal with,

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.570
then you can forget about it,
nasty old man!

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.660
[SHIRO] You've got skills,
that's for sure.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.450
But still, kicking down
your father like that...

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.580
You've got a lotta nerve
to try me, boy!

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:41.800
[SHIRO laughs] I'm gonna show
you what happens when

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.970
you try to disrespect
your elders, you upstart!

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:47.430
Seriously, could you
keep it down, please?

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:51.220
Roughhousing on New
Year's Eve, of all days.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.680
And Shinichi, didn't you
tell me that you had plans

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.050
for a shrine visit first
thing in the morning?

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.980
You trying to
show up with injuries?

00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.440
Eh?!

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.440
[SAKURAI screaming]

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.700
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Hey, Sakurai!

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:18.590
Yo. Here's to
surviving another one.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.410
A Happy New Year to us all.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.670
[gasps] Right back atcha,
Happy New Year, guys.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.130
Let's hope this
one turns out nice.

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:27.880
Now then, was there a reason

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.130
you wanted us gentlemen
to meet up earlier?

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.350
You wanted to talk
privately, right?

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:38.480
Yeah. Anyway, if you could
keep this to yourselves...

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.060
I'm actually looking
for some advice here.

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:44.770
Recently, I learned something
personal about someone.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.030
I suppose I've been
racking my brain over it

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:49.780
and I'd like to put it to rest.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.400
Basically, I need answers

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:54.990
and I could seriously
use your insight.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.370
So, you stumbled into
a piece of information,

00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:59.620
I'm guessing it was
an accident,

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.080
and now this intel has slowly
been eating away at you.

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:04.630
Do I have that right?

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:06.250
[SAKURAI]
Yeah, that's right.

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.720
So, what's the big secret?

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.140
Well, it's hard to believe.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:14.350
But I think that...
That Uzaki, uh...

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:17.100
That's she's in love with me.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:24.730
[SAKAKI] Uh, Saku.
That might be news to you,

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:25.940
but we've all known that.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:26.850
For a while.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.070
[SAKURAI gasps]

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:30.360
Wait, you all knew?
Are you exaggerating?

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.320
[SAKAKI] Nah, for real.
We weren't kidding.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.240
[CAFÉ OWNER] Ami, the café
customers, everyone knows.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.240
[SAKAKI]
Everyone except you, apparently.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:39.420
No freaking way!

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.330
Well, now that that's
out of the way,

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:43.040
what are you gonna do
about this monumental

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.410
new revelation you've
finally unearthed?

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.540
Huh? Am I supposed
to do something?

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:49.340
Don't give us
that crap, Sakurai.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.630
If you think you're about to
get away with playing dumb

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.760
and changing the subject,

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.430
then you've another
thing coming, pal!

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:55.970
How did you know I was gonna--

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:58.640
Cause it's what you
always do! Get real!

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.640
Are you honestly cool
with sitting on your hands

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.260
and letting things
stay like this?

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.770
Not even bothering to
let the facts sink in?

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:06.730
It not like that.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.480
I'm pretty sure you already know
what needs to happen here.

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.070
I mean, it's troubled
you to the point

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.030
that you're asking
for advice after all.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.030
It's obvious that you're
just fishing for a way

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:17.450
to avoid the situation
when you know you can't.

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:18.870
[SAKURAI gasps]

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:21.370
Try all you like, but there's
no un-ringing that bell.

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:24.370
Whatever you choose to do
next is what's important.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:28.260
Listen, all you need to think
about is what you wanna do.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.140
I should probably
figure out what that is.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.260
But this is all kind
of unfair, isn't it?

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:40.890
Talking about Uzaki's
feelings behind her back

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:42.850
and deciding what to
do with about them?

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:44.390
It's not right.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.570
The only kind of person
who'd do that is a coward.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.480
Uzaki deserves better.
Forget it. I'm out. I'm sorry!

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:53.110
Oh please, quit being a martyr
and drop the valiant hero act

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:54.780
before I lose my friggin mind!

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.400
What's cowardly is how
you haven't done jack!

00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:59.120
He's only read my like a book!

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.950
[laughs] Sorry to spoil the fun,

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.580
but we'd better
collect ourselves.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.000
It would appear that Ami
and Hana are in the vicinity,

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.580
so we should meet up with them.

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:10.550
[SAKURAI, SAKAKI]
Hm? Sure.

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:13.380
Look man, there's still a lot
I want to say about this,

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.750
but I'll leave you
with one last thought.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.340
[SAKURAI]
What is it?

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:20.230
We've got your back, okay, dude?
Don't be scared to reach out.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:21.970
We're here to help.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:26.400
[SAKAKI]
Right. So, uh... Best of luck.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.980
Thanks, you guys.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.770
[SAKURAI] I promised her I'd
shape up, so I'm facing this

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:33.660
head on. No more running away.

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:35.570
[UZAKI] Hey everybody!
Took you long enough!

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:37.530
We're right over here!

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.580
[SAKURAI] I've worried
over this for so long,

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.870
but I couldn't even bring
myself to ask for advice.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.050
And even then, I'm so pitiful

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.040
that I had to be
shook into action.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:55.430
I apologize for being so unfair.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:56.760
Happy New Year.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.140
I'm looking forward to
having more fun together.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.560
Same.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.010
[SAKURAI] I've thought
about it a million times,

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.520
and I keep coming back
to the same realization.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:09.770
[UZAKI grunts]

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:11.810
Whoa, you feelin'
a little chilly?

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:15.700
Here, I'll save our spot.
You go warm up in the car.

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:19.160
Huh? Thank you, Sakurai.
That's so considerate.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.120
What, no need to
make it a big deal!

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.160
You're the only one
here who's doing that.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.580
[CROWD murmuring]

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.080
[SAKURAI]
Someday,

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.950
I'll have the confidence to say
it with my head held high.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.670
[UZAKI] Look, the first sunrise
of the year. Oh, it's beautiful!

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:35.630
Oh, wow.

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:37.500
[laughs]

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:43.090
[SAKURAI]
I love you, Uzaki.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:45.970
[gasps]

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.100
Uh, Sakurai?

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:50.470
So, here's the thing...

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.650
[UZAKI]
Yeah? What's up?

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:56.860
[SAKURAI]
I... I-I really...

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.780
[SAKURAI]
No. Not just yet.

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:08.700
I'm really looking forward
to hanging out with you more.

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:11.380
Glad to hear it!

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.880
I'm excited to hang out more
with you, too, Sakurai.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.210
I can't wait! [laughs]
