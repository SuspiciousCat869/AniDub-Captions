WEBVTT

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.590
[UZAKI grumbles]

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.020
I mean, after next year,
I'll be graduating.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.610
[UZAKI grumbles]

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.650
[YANAGI] Huh? What's the matter,
Hana, something on your mind?

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.940
You wanna tell me about it?

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.980
[UZAKI grunting]
Oh, it's nothing to worry about.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.160
[YANAGI]
Yeah right.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.330
She's not fooling
anyone with that face.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.290
Aw, gee. This about your
mysterious man-friend?

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.160
[UZAKI]
Uh! No, it isn't!

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.620
[YANAGI]
Heh, she's so easy to read.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.040
No need to play dumb, girl!

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.370
You know you can always share
anything with me, right?

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.790
Why're you being so weird?

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.380
And besides, what's
there for me to share

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.340
with someone who's
still in middle school?

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.550
Keep on deflecting all you
want, but let's be real,

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.670
with the way you go about your
love life you might as well

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.550
still be in middle school
yourself, ya big widdle baby.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.890
I am not a baby

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.310
and I'm going about things
just fine, thank you!

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.560
And it's got nothing
to do with love!

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.930
[YANAGI]
Yeah, okay.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.110
It looks like things are
finally starting to heat up.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.290
You mind if I borrow
your textbook?

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.910
I was in a rush this morning
and left mine at home.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.840
You're more than welcome to
use it as long as you can

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.920
ignore all the messy notes
I took in the margins.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.260
Actually, I'm glad
you took them,

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.550
I'm sure they'll come in handy.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.130
Sakurai does get
good grades, after all.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.390
[CLASSMATE A]
Oh, that reminds me.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.060
Are you gonna come for
drinks later this week?

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.560
I'm afraid I won't be there.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.020
I've gotta work a shift
at the café that day.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.600
[CLASSMATE A]
That's too bad.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.650
[CLASSMATE B] Promise us you'll
try to stop by next time, okay?

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.730
[SAKURAI]
It does sound fun. We'll see.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.860
I told you this
would happen, didn't I?

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.740
[UZAKI gasps]
Uh. What are you talking about.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.570
I was just waiting for
the right moment to launch

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.830
a surprise attack
against our loner friend.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.660
[SAKAKI] Man. You're an
awful liar, you know that?

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.410
Those girls you were
spying on happen to be

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.670
in the same class
as me and Saku.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.790
Whenever we go out, they're
always complaining about

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.220
how they're still single.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.130
I think they're hoping
to make a move on him.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.010
[laughing] Do you hear
yourself right now?

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.550
You shouldn't go around
making weird assumptions.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.020
Yeah, you're one to talk.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.020
They probably saw him
walking through the hallway

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.520
all by his lonesome
and decided to

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.390
keep him company for a while.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.570
As far as I'm concerned,
you should be relieved

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.650
that there are other angels
like me keeping an eye on him.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.020
How selfless of you.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.780
And with more people
to babysit the guy,

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.400
the less I'll have
to break my back taking

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.240
care of him, thank goodness.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.450
It'll save me a ton
of time and energy!

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.700
So you see, this is
actually a good thing!

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.620
Then I hope you won't mind
if I give those girls

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.290
the green light to ask Sakurai
for some private tutoring.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.040
[UZAKI] Uh. Well. That would
be a different story.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.300
I'm gonna need you to explain

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.260
this sudden change
of heart for me.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.260
You once said that you felt
obligated to check in on him.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.930
Right?

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.180
And just now,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.550
you implied that
you were fine with

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.480
other people doing
the checking in, right?

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.190
Ugh. Okay. You got me!

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.610
Still, though.
You're forgetting something.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:32.860
Those girls there?

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.820
They've got no chance of
ever making it with him.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.160
And that's 'cause that idiot
doesn't want any woman but me!

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.410
Ugh, not that stupid
argument again!

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.080
Even if those dime-a-dozen
floozies were actually into

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.910
Sakurai like that, I'm the
one hottie has the hots for,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.630
so there'd be no use
coming onto him anyway.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.420
Gotta say, they're only
setting themselves up

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.710
for disappointment.
I mean, seriously.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.580
How pathetic would
it be to get rejected

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.760
by a socially awkward
dork like him?

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.300
If you think about it, I'm
performing a public service

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.630
by taking up his attention
and protecting everyone else

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.470
from the threat of shame
and embarrassment!

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.730
[SAKAKI] Of course. The twisted
logic of a narcissist!

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.600
[UZAKI]
Then again.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.530
I was mulling over something
you said a while ago.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.450
About speeding up my approach?

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.810
I remember.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.530
[UZAKI] I didn't want
to believe it, but...

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.320
You weren't wrong
to bring it up.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.070
Oh?

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.040
You were right.
The man's a real catch.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.410
Who wouldn't rush
to take him home

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:26.530
and meet their folks?

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.710
Even as a friend,
I can see that much.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.500
[SAKAKI]
Better late than never.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.580
You made me realize
something else, too.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.210
He's a third-year student now.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.460
And we're nearly
through December!

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.920
Which means his college years
are practically over.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.550
Like dust in the wind!

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:41.920
Time's running out.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.640
I have to do something about
him before graduation!

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.430
'Cause that's what
you meant, right?

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:48.970
You've got it
completely twisted!

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.310
[UZAKI]
Stop yelling!

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.970
My original point was that
you've got to hurry up

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.150
and stake a claim before
someone else beats you to it!

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.650
You won't need a
whole year to bag him,

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:56.900
and I'm confused
as to why you think

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.650
it would even take that long!

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.730
[SAKAKI]
Ugh, what a pain.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.070
If one of these fools would bite
the bullet and be honest,

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.240
this wouldn't be
an issue anymore!

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.320
Still though, at least the girl
has some sort of goal in mind.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.830
Progress is progress.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.700
And this change of heart
is a big leap forward

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.290
as far as Uzaki's concerned.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.460
[UZAKI] Anyway. I won't
give up just yet!

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.790
In a year's time, I'll make
that boy confess his love.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.260
Quit beating around the bush!

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.430
You keep going on about
not having enough time,

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.430
but if you tell him you like him
then this'll all be settled

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.600
in an instant, so march on
over there and do it already!

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.760
Huh? What're you, nuts?

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:29.600
I'm not gonna spew
that lovey-dovey crap!

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.310
But you're in love with him!
Why not?

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.480
How many times do I need to
remind you that Sakurai's

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.650
the one who's into me instead
of the other way around?

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.020
It's getting pretty old
hearing you get

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.990
mixed up over and
over again, bruh.

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.410
[SAKAKI] What's getting old
is you being in denial!

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.740
Ugh... Whatever, man.
This is so exhausting.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.360
It seems like you're
ready to go for it,

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.200
so don't hold back
on my account.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.990
Good luck with
your happy ending.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.620
[UZAKI]
Could I ask you one more thing?

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.950
What is it now?

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.370
You wouldn't happen to
know the best way to make

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.670
a stubborn meathead spill
the beans, would ya?

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.290
Try a knife!

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.970
[SAKURAI]
Uh? Did you get enough sleep,

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.140
Itsuhito? You look like crap.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.140
Please, enough
with the compliments.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.140
I was just giving a good
pal some friendly advice.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.190
I'd like to think I pointed
them in the right direction,

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.610
but who even knows? We'll see.

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:19.980
Ah...

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:21.110
[SAKAKI sighs]

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.820
Got a question for ya.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.280
[SAKAKI]
Hm?

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.820
[SAKURAI] Uzaki threw me a
little birthday celebration

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.030
a while back.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.200
[SAKAKI] So I hear.
Thanks for the invite.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.410
[SAKURAI]
Yeah, you're welcome.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:31.870
Anyway, I was wondering
what would make

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.540
a good thank-you
present for her.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.080
Maybe something special
that a girl would like?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.590
Y'know, forget I asked.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.050
I should probably
figure this out myself.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.970
No worries. I'll let
you handle it, then.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:50.390
[SAKAKI]
I'm calling it.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.760
Those slowpokes'll be
official before they know it.

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:00.940
[UZAKI] Stupid Sakaki.
He wasn't any help at all.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.940
Either way, I've definitely
got my work cut out for me.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.700
[inaudible]

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.160
[UZAKI]
C'mon tough stuff.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.530
What's a gal gotta
do to make you sing?

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.870
[UZAKI grumbles]

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:20.840
[UZAKI gasps]
Eureka!

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:22.760
[UZAKI]
Here's an idea!

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.130
Sakurai's always slumming it

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:25.840
at the dining hall
or snacking on junk,

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.380
so what if I
started bringing him

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.430
personalized lunches instead?

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.010
Dude, do you know
how cringy that sounds?

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:32.130
Are you running a daycare?

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.510
[UZAKI]
Huh?

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.230
[SAKAKI] Aw, screw it!
As long as you're motivated,

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:37.060
you might as well
keep charging ahead!

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:40.350
It's a billion times better than
your usual tiptoeing around.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.940
Nothing ventured, nothing
gained, as they say!

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.440
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Yikes. Sakaki finally

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.110
became unhinged. The kid's
completely fired up.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:49.860
It's a perfectly nice gesture.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:52.370
Anybody would be happy to dig
into a homemade meal

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.620
prepared by a cute
girl like you, Hana.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.990
That's what I thought!

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.710
And since I cook
for him all the time,

00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:59.330
I already know what
his favorites are.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:02.080
Enough meals and he'll
confess to me for sure.

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:05.760
It'll be like shooting
fish in a barrel!

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.800
[UZAKI] Poop. This is gonna be
tougher than I thought.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.930
[FUJIO]
Yes... Yes... Yes... Yes...

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.720
[UZAKI] Why is the whole
family staring at me?

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.770
Mom's helping me with a kitchen
project, so she's in the clear.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:21.600
But what are the rest
of you plebs doin' here?

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.030
Normally I'd be in my room
playing video games,

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.240
but I don't have anyone
to play with me right now.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.320
I'd ask Kiri, but he's
been turning me down

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.030
'cause I keep destroying him.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:31.400
[KIRI grunting]

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.410
And besides, I've been
having way more fun

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.870
keeping an eye on
my big sister lately.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.370
So are you preparing lunch
for someone special?

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.950
You're a great cook, so whoever
it is, I'm sure you'll have them

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.460
licking the plate and
begging for seconds!

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.710
Anyway, don't let me stop
you from going on ahead

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:46.960
with whatever you
were 'bout to do.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.340
Just pretend I'm
a fly on the wall.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.800
[UZAKI] Could you pretend
somewhere else, please?

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.550
What's your deal, Kiri?

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.680
Wow, rude much?

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.720
Don't lump me in
with Little Miss Creep.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.520
It's not like I'm here
to pick on you.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.850
Why are you here?

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:01.970
To polish off any
leftover scraps, duh.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.400
Now hurry up and start choppin'!

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.690
[UZAKI] Go back to your
room, you vulture!

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.810
What about you, Dad?

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.480
[UZAKI] That face is so...
Forget I asked.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.360
[TSUKI] I had no idea
that our family liked

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.410
peeking into other
people's lives so much.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:17.780
[NARRATOR]
Tsuki forgot that she did

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:22.040
the same thing while
watching her TV dramas.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.710
There's so many
recipes in this thing.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:24.790
What should I make?

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.580
Bento lunches
can be extravagant,

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:29.460
but there's no need to do
anything out of the ordinary.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:31.510
You can put in whatever
your heart desires

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.140
as long as you avoid
anything raw that could spoil.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.220
You could always make
your signature dish.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.010
Or you can try a combination
of your favorites!

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.230
How 'bout I throw
in some tamagoyaki?

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:42.850
Sounds delicious!

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.060
[TSUKI] Ha! A real
mother-daughter conversation.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:48.320
My precious angel's
grown up so fast!

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.940
[YANAGI]

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.490
Yeah, what is it?

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:52.990
[YANAGI]
Ta-da!

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.070
You should decorate it in
the shape of a big ol' heart.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.910
[UZAKI] And you should
mind your own business.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.200
Let me cook in peace.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.950
Or maybe you could
swap out the rice

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.540
and add some chicken
breast instead.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.410
[UZAKI]
Could you please butt out, Dad?

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.920
[KIRI]
You heard her!

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.880
I'm eating this, too, so don't
put anything weird in it!

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.670
[UZAKI]
Neither of you are eating squat!

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.000
[KIRI, FUJIO]
Aww.

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:11.260
Fine whatever, I'll make sure

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.010
there's enough for
everyone, okay?

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:14.590
[KIRI, FUJIO]
Yeah boye!

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:17.720
Ah... Y'know, I've gotta
hand it to you, Mom.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.550
Didn't realize
whipping up a bento

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.060
could be such hard work.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.350
[TSUKI] I'm not too sure
about that, dear.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.520
You usually don't have
everybody getting in your way.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:30.740
[SAKURAI]
Wassup?

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.200
Ah. It's freezing out there.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.870
Mind telling me why you called
me down to the basement today--

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:41.040
[UZAKI]
I packed you some lunch.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.830
Um. Y'know, just 'cause.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:47.080
Anyway, this one's yours.
So, here you go.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.470
Uh. Wow. I, uh...

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.090
[SAKURAI]
What's my problem?

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:57.130
I mean, it's not like she's
never cooked me food before.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.430
So then. Why does
this feel different?

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:04.180
Holy crap. My heart's beating
a thousand times a minute.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.110
[SAKURAI]
Oh, uh... This is unexpected.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.570
[SAKURAI] It's just lunch.
Why am I freaking out?

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:12.280
What's going on?

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.150
[SAKURAI]
Thank you, Hana.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.320
Guess I'll be on
my way then, see ya.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:20.200
Huh? Why're you leaving?

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.490
Uh. So you can dig in.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.290
Don't you wanna enjoy
that down here

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.500
where no one can bother you?

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.540
Why would I?

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.160
Something wrong
with the cafeteria?

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:32.130
[UZAKI] Uh, the cafeteria's
fine! I just figured you might

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.130
be used to taking your
meals alone is all!

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:36.050
[SAKURAI]
What? I always eat with friends!

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:37.380
Oh, do you?

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.390
Well, I did pack myself
a lunch, too, so, uh...

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.470
So do you wanna eat together?

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:45.720
[gasping] Mm-hm...

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.480
Man. So cold.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.230
There any particular reason
we're avoiding the dining hall?

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:02.610
Yeah, our lunches kinda match.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.490
Wouldn't want anyone to see us
and make weird assumptions.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:09.380
Right. That makes sense.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.380
[SAKURAI] 'Cause eating
matching bentos is totally

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.050
the sort of thing
that couples do.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.260
C'mon, use your brain, dummy!

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.920
Sorry about that.

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:20.390
I didn't have enough time to
arrange the food differently.

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.350
Hey, it's no big deal.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:26.730
Since you cooked, why don't
I grab us drinks? My treat.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:28.190
[UZAKI]
Sure. Thanks.

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.770
Wait. Is this my imagination?

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:34.100
Or is this an actual
development?

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:35.610
Whaddaya know.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.570
Turns out Uzaki's homemade meal
trick was super effective.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:41.780
Perfect. Glad to see them
making some progress.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.610
Nothing left for me to do
but make a quiet exit.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.450
[NARRATOR] Elsewhere,
Fujio'ed made a loud entrance.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.580
[FUJIO]
Check it out, everyone!

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.620
Take a look at what
my baby girl made.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:54.210
Smells amazing, huh?
Can't wait to dig in!

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:55.460
Can you keep it down?

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:56.580
[FUJIO]
Uh?

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:57.590
[COWORKER A]
According to the schedule,

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.340
it isn't time for
your break yet.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:00.760
Would you mind putting
your food away

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.300
and getting back to work?

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.760
[NARRATOR] Though Daddy was
proud of his daughter's efforts,

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.680
his coworkers were
less than thrilled.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:13.270
Operation Bento Box was a
critical success, everybody!

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:16.100
Guess my plan wasn't
so cringy after all, huh?

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.360
Nicely done, agent!

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.530
Keep it up and you'll
win him over real soon.

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:20.990
[SAKAKI]
Things would be moving

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:23.490
a heck of a lot faster if it
weren't for this nonsense.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:26.820
[laughing]

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.450
[UZAKI grunting]

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:34.920
[UZAKI] Gotta go
fast! Almost there! Ahh!

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Aww! Aw, come on.
You're heckin' kidding me!

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:41.510
Don't be so upset,
you almost beat me.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:43.130
I can tell you're getting
better and better

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.100
at this after every
other round.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.810
The only reason I'm improving
is because I have you here

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:49.520
to keep me on my toes, Yanagi...

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.100
[YANAGI]
It's like clockwork.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:54.270
Hana discovers a cool new co-op
or a multiplayer game to play,

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:56.100
and she asks me
to help her get good

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:58.320
so she can show off
on her boy toy.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.900
How 'bout a gratin?

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.730
[YANAGI]
She may be my big sis,

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.870
but she's got a funny way of
showing affection sometimes.

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:07.620
That guy pal of yours is a
really big gamer too, isn't he?

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.450
Yeah, but he's always
sinking tons of hours

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:12.120
into single player games
instead of ones like these.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.580
That's why I put him
onto other genres

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.120
to help him switch things up.

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:16.710
Variety is important.

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:19.250
By the way, when do I get
to meet this pixel master?

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:20.590
[UZAKI]
How 'bout never.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.800
Oh, right, I have
a report to finish.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.720
But that's the same excuse
you make every time I ask.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.760
Wait, let's play another round.
Promise I'll be quiet!

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:30.980
Ugh, there she goes,
running off again.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:32.980
She really can be so stubborn.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.980
Why does she hate the idea
of us meeting so much?

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.940
That girl's got some secrets.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.610
And she's definitely not sharing
them with me anytime soon.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.400
But that's okay. I've got
some tricks up my sleeve.

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:44.780
Look at you.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.360
Is there a reason you're
looking so smiley?

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:49.120
May there is, maybe there isn't.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.410
Oh?

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:57.700
[UZAKI screaming]
I can't believe I overslept!

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.500
I wasn't expecting anybody else
to be awake at this hour.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:02.090
What're you doing up?

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.090
Having tea.

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:04.170
[UZAKI]
Must be nice!

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:05.850
Do you have a shift at the café?

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.420
[UZAKI]
You know it. See you later!

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:09.760
Have a good day at work, Hana!

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.020
Better get changed.

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:26.160
Okiedokie. Time to head out
and make some mischief!

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.830
Hello, welcome to in! Uh?!

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:38.410
Why, hello there!

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.880
Nice to meet you. I'm Hana's
little sister Yanagi.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.750
Our family really appreciates
you for putting up with her.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.090
[CAFÉ OWNER]
The pleasure is all mine.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:47.260
[UZAKI]
Why are you here?

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.220
I thought you were
at home, drinking tea!

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.100
[YANAGI] I'm in a coffee
mood now. So here I am.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.140
[UZAKI gasping]
How did you find me?

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.680
[YANAGI] Oh. I asked Mom
where your job was.

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:59.020
[UZAKI growls]

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.390
Before you get upset,

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.610
all I did was inquire about
your place of employment

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:04.360
out of concern for your safety.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.030
I mean, it's not like I was
secretly snooping for details

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:08.950
about your love
life or anything.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.410
Could you leave?!

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:11.740
Whoa hey, relax.

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.410
Why are you trying to
chase a customer off

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:15.120
when they've barely even
walked in the door?

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.830
Good thing you avoided
the morning rush.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:19.460
This way you can spread out
and make yourself at home.

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.380
Feel free to sit
anywhere you like.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.550
[YANAGI] Whoa, he's huge.
He must be Hana's friend!

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:27.180
Wait a sec. Time out.
Could we not?

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:28.930
I've never had
my friends or family

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:30.760
come and visit me
while I'm on the job.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.260
How am I gonna focus
on my hustle

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.840
when I'm being observed?

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.810
[SAKURAI] I was in
the same exact situation

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:38.100
not too long ago.
Sucks, doesn't it?

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.260
[UZAKI groans]

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:40.640
[SAKURAI]
Chill out. We don't wanna make

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:42.400
a bad impression
on a new customer,

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.230
so I'll just clean-up while
you wait on your sister.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.860
[UZAKI]
Traitor.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:47.980
Oh-ho!

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:49.450
[UZAKI grunts]

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:51.870
I was surprised to learn you
took a part-time café gig

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:53.790
when you were already
so busy with school.

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:55.710
But this place seems
nice and I can tell

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.030
you get along
with your co-workers.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.080
'Specially tall boy.

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:07.790
Order, please.
That'll be one café au lait.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.130
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Coming right up.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:10.750
[SAKURAI]
What's the big deal anyway?

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.260
You didn't seem to
have any problem when

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:13.840
Ms. Tsuki was here.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:15.680
You and your weird names.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.010
What's weird about 'em?

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.350
[UZAKI] I dunno.
You just say things weird!

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:23.980
All I'm trying to say is that
she can be a handful sometimes.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.440
What's that mean?

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.770
It's nothing.

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:28.200
I guess I didn't know you
had a younger sibling.

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:29.730
Something funny 'bout that?

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:30.860
What is there to make fun of?

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:32.900
Just simmer down
and hear me out, okay?

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:35.030
Ever since we became
friends, it's like

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.160
one moment you're taking care
of me and being oddly nice,

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.950
the next, you're making a fuss
and nagging me to death.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.830
And I never understood why.

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:44.080
But now, the way you function

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.460
is finally starting to
make sense to me.

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:50.000
[UZAKI growls]
What's the big epiphany, genius?

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:52.510
You act like a big sister
'cause you are a big sister.

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.010
Oh, shut up! You sure
you're not messing with me?

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:58.220
No, I'm serious.
I grew up an only child, y'know.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.680
I can't imagine what
you've gotta put up with.

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:02.060
Just proud of you.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.560
Now I know you're being a jerk.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.770
I can promise you I'm not.

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.110
Really?

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:10.440
Cross my heart, hope to die.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.950
All right.
One piping hot café au lait.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:19.240
[UZAKI]
Uh-- Thank you, boss!

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:22.330
Let's see. As long as I
keep Sakurai away from her,

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:25.000
I can make it through this
day with my dignity intact.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.670
I'll act as a human shield.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:29.590
Isolate Yanagi through
aggressive customer service.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.550
And then interrogate her
once we get back home.

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.050
Thanks for being patient,
sis! Here's ya go.

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:37.050
Say, could your man friend
to wait on me instead--

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:41.100
Your table was assigned to me,
so I'll be your waiter.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.480
I have to block off conversation
by any means necessary!

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.730
[SAKURAI]
Aren't you forgetting something?

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:48.980
You were supposed to give her
a hot towel, remember?

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:52.150
We provide them for our patrons
when it's freezing outside.

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:53.070
Right. Here you go.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.190
Oh, wow.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.950
Talk about excellent
customer service.

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:58.410
This'll make my hands
feel nice and toasty.

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:00.490
Quit being such
a tryhard, Sakurai!

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:01.790
[SAKURAI]
What are you yelling at me for?

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:03.250
I'm doing my job!

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:05.000
Hey, you Hana's classmate?

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.620
Mind if we chat for a bit while
I wait for my drink to cool?

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:09.630
It would be a shame
if I burned my tongue.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:10.710
[UZAKI]
Would it?

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:12.630
Oh, uh. I don't see why not,

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:14.050
we don't have
any other customers

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.420
and I've got nothing else to do.

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:18.010
[UZAKI]
Seriously? I have to stop them.

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.880
At this rate, she'll ask him
something I'll never live down!

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:22.180
Would you believe
I've been excited

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.100
to meet you in person
for a while?

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.180
You're like a celebrity,

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:26.860
from the way Hana
talks about you.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.270
Talks about me?

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.100
Don't you have some tables
you should be wiping down?

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:31.860
I'm done cleaning
everything already.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.610
For somebody who's
terrible in the kitchen,

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.230
you really are efficient
when it comes to tidying up!

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.820
[SAKURAI]
Uh. Thank you?

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.530
Wait, is that supposed to be
a compliment or an insult?

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.040
I was curious, how old are you,
Mr. Hana's friend?

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.660
Just turned 21.
And how 'bout you, miss?

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:46.670
I'm an eighth-grader.

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:47.840
That's surprising.

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:49.620
You seem way more
put together than Hana,

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:50.880
so I could've sworn
you were at least

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.290
in high school at first glance.

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:53.510
[UZAKI]
Hey, let's wrap it up?

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:54.880
Do I really come off
more mature than her?

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.210
Oh yeah, totally.

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:57.720
Well thanks for the chat,
better get back to work!

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.260
By the way, my sister told
me that you play a lot of

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.430
video games, so you might be
pleased to know that I'm

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:04.510
actually something of
an avid gamer myself.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.100
A woman of culture.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.720
[YANAGI]
I started this new RPG.

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:09.230
What's the title?

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.100
[YANAGI] It's <i>Final Quester:</i>
<i>Tales of Pocketter,</i>

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:12.530
<i>Lousy Catter.</i>

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.490
The epic sounding one with
all the e r's in the name!

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:15.820
Game's a classic!

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.530
The opening cutscene
was way too long,

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.320
but I lived for
every second of it.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.030
The graphics were sick
and the camera work

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:23.150
during the climax was great,
but I definitely had

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.080
issues after it cut
back to gameplay.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.620
They had the nerve to
make the first mission

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.830
a fetch quest for
medicinal herbs!

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:31.710
[YANAGI] I'm not the biggest fan
of the story pacing so far.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.210
[SAKURAI]
You're preaching to the choir.

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:34.670
At least you get
a horse to ride on.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:36.000
[UZAKI]
Crap, I hate this.

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:38.220
The conversation's actually
getting interesting!

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:41.390
[CAFÉ OWNER] Poor Hana.
Bet she didn't see this coming.

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:42.600
[SAKURAI]
You've got good taste, miss.

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.220
Sorry, don't mean
to cut you off.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.470
But we're buddies now,

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.230
so there's no need to
be so formal, Sakurai.

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:48.390
[UZAKI gasps]

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.400
You're welcome to
call me by my name, too.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.650
Yanagi works perfectly fine.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.940
Huh? Well, okay.
Yanagi it is, then.

00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:04.000
[UZAKI screaming]
I knew this was gonna happen!

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:06.570
[NARRATOR] "The goose in the
back soon comes to the lead."

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:09.160
An outdated proverb that
means even stragglers

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:11.670
can surpass you
when you least expect it.
