WEBVTT

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.850
[FUJIO]
Good news everyone!

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.060
"Dear old Dad" happens
to have this Sunday off!

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.850
And since Kiri and Yanagi
are done with their exams,

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.230
I thought, why not go somewhere?

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.020
[UZAKI]
Where did you have in mind?

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.230
[FUJIO]
One of our members at the gym

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.480
was raving about this place.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.860
Oh? What is it? Someplace fun?

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.990
Take a look! Whattaya think?

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.240
[UZAKI]
Hakone Kowakien Yunessun?

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.200
[FUJIO] It's a hot spring
that's open year-round!

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.330
Even in the winter!

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.870
[UZAKI]
Like a real hot spring?

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.750
Wouldn't you get light-head
swimming in one of those?

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.670
It's gonna be fine, they
say they keep the water

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.540
"comfortably warm."

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.800
Oh look, they
have private baths!

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.550
You know, I think a weekend
getaway sounds delightful.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.680
So, it's a place to swim?

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.980
[KIRI screaming]

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.520
[KIRI gasping]

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.190
Kiri? What's the word? You in?

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.570
N-No way! Anything but that!

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.490
I'm not going anywhere
near that place!

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.530
[FUJIO]
But it's just swimming!

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.180
Wow, we really lucked out
on the weather, didn't we!

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.590
Y'know, I can't see why Kiri was
so hell-bent against this.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.600
[TSUKI]
He's a teenager. Whatever it is,

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.640
I'm sure he thinks it's
the end of the world.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.480
You remember how we were.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.980
He probably thinks he'll have
a lot more fun at home alone.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.940
Yeah, right! In his bedroom.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.190
I was really hoping
this could be a trip

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.940
the whole family
could enjoy together.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.070
[TSUKI]
Oh, Fujio...

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.450
[FUJIO]
Kiri is a young man, after all.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.790
I'm sure he'll be
fine on his own.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.250
Truth is, it's Hana who I hope
to connect with this weekend.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.130
Hey, Hana. You must be bummed

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.670
you're not with Sakurai
this weekend.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.970
How bad do you wish
he were here now?

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.430
You know, if this place actually
turns out to be cool,

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.350
the two of you could always come
back here sometime as a couple!

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.680
Would you cut it out?
You're not being funny!

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.190
Uh-oh, is someone blushing?

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.560
[FUJIO growling]

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.820
Uh, honey? The children
are in the car.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.280
Let's not do anything
hasty. Please?

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.200
Whoever you are, you won't
steal my baby girl!

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.000
[DRIVER A humming]

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.790
[DRIVER A]
What the--?

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.750
Where did they come from?
They're right on top of me!

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.170
[TSUKI gasping]

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.470
[FUJIO] Oh, Hana! You've made
a habit of coming home

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.640
so late these days! And that's
if you come home at all!

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.680
Your mother and sister won't
tell me anything about this guy!

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.100
Whenever I ask, they dodge
or change the subject.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.440
Oh, beloved daughter of mine.
Have you forgotten what a

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.110
special relationship
we used to have?

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.900
Listen up, Hana. If you want
to survive in this world,

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.990
you're going to need to know
when to say "what the heck,"

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.660
"do I look like I care,"
and "fuhgeddaboudit."

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.660
Fuhgeddaboudit!

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.790
Perfect! Yes!

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.420
[FUJIO] Look, Hana, a perfect
sunset, just like in the movies!

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.840
Isn't it beautiful?

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.250
Do I look like I care?

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.380
Hana! Look at you!
Perfect timing!

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.180
[laughing]

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
I want to stay a
part of your life.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.930
To laugh with you like we used
to when you were young!

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.470
[DRIVER A]
Eyes front, idiot!

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.190
No matter what!
No matter what it takes...

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.980
My family will enjoy
this day together!

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.940
If it's the last thing I do!

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.320
Huh? What the--?
Is that car on fire!

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.200
[FUJIO]
I will win my daughter back!

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.280
This trip will restore
our father-daughter bond!

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.240
[FUJIO yelling]

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.660
[DRIVER A yelps]

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.430
Thanks for coming in!

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.430
Hana! Check it out!

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.720
[UZAKI] I guess this
must be their mascot.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.940
[YANAGI]
It's adorable!

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.220
Ah!

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.100
Wow, you know what this
place reminds me of?

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.560
What do they call that
architecture in Rome?

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.810
[YANAGI]
Roman architecture?

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.140
[UZAKI]
Yeah, that! Wait...

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.810
[YANAGI] Hana, look!
There's a water slide outside!

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.810
[UZAKI] I think it's called
"Rodeo Mountain."

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.440
[WOMAN A screaming]

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.230
[UZAKI laughing]

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:43.820
[TSUKI]
They seem to be having fun.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:49.990
Ah... Oh, my heart. Ah...

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.410
[BOTH laughing]

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.160
The water's so nice!
It's so warm!

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.790
I feel like I could just
drift off to sleep in here!

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.420
Like a watery futon!

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.000
Hey girls, if you want, there
are a lot of other baths

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.920
we can try out down that way!

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.090
Sounds good! C'mon, Hana!
Let's head over!

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.350
[UZAKI]
A wine bath!

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.430
[TSUKI] It's supposed
to be rejuvenating.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.350
This must be how Cleopatra
took all her baths!

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.770
[FUJIO]
Et tu, Yanè?

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.850
[YANAGI] That's Caesar and
Brutus. Get a clue, Dad.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.860
[UZAKI]
A coffee bath?

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.320
[YANAGI]
This smells amazing!

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.940
[TSUKI] It's supposed to
help wake up your skin

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.820
and make you look younger!

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.950
[UZAKI]
There's a sake bath here?

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.540
Oh, and a green-tea bath!

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.250
[YANAGI] Come look at this!
It's Doctor Fish!

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.080
You know we're going in, right?

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:42.050
Wait, seriously?
Yeah, we are! [laughs]

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:45.460
[gasps] You really hit
a home run with this!

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:46.680
I'm glad.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.890
Our family really needed
something like this.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:53.680
[TSUKI] Hey, why don't we
go try it, too?

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:58.810
[UZAKI laughing]

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:01.440
[YANAGI]
Oh man! It's so tickley!

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.820
[UZAKI laughs]
This is too much! I can't!

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:08.450
I think I need to bail!
I'm dying here!

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.530
Hey come on!
This is a public place!

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.870
You need to keep
your voices down

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.910
or you'll give someone
the wrong idea.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.370
Hm?

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:22.250
[TSUKI moans, laughs]
It really does tickle though!

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.010
[FUJIO] Honey come on, listen
to how you sound right now!

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:27.510
[laughing]

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.050
Nope! I'm out! See ya!

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.350
Yeah! Me, too! Catch ya later!

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.730
Girls, why don't we all
go somewhere together?

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:38.730
[yelps]

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:41.270
Oh, Fujio!
You all right, sweetie?

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:43.900
I'm fine. Just embarrassed.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.110
Hey, at least I didn't
squash any of the fish.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.490
Oh, my! N-No! Please! Not there!

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.660
Ah! I'm too ticklish
for fish-nibbles!

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.200
--[yelps]
--[splash]

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.870
No! My Fujio!

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.040
Oh no, those devilish fish
have taken my husband.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:03.750
[UZAKI]
That was way too intense!

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.380
[YANAGI giggles]
Yeah, you got that right.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.220
Although, I think my feet
do feel a little smoother.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.720
[UZAKI]
Yeah, mine too!

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.180
[YANAGI]
Well? Whattaya wanna do next?

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.510
[UZAKI] Dunno! Let's wait
for Mom and Dad to catch up.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.060
[FLIRT A] Well, well!
Look who we have here!

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.390
I didn't know they
let cuties swim here.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.560
What brings you to
the pool, ladies?

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.190
Hana? I think they're
trying to hit on us.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.650
What? Do people still do that?

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.530
I haven't been
flirted with in ages.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.650
[gasps] Obviously,
'cause you're always

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.120
wrapped around
the arm of Sakurai.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.490
You know it!

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.450
He's always keeping away
all of the would-be suitors

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.250
with those scary eyes of his!

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.040
Right. I'm sure that's
exactly what it is.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.000
[FLIRT A] Hey, quit
chit-chattin' amongst yourselves

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:46.960
and talk to us, would ya?

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.880
[FLIRT B] Ya wanna come
grab a drink with us?

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:53.130
[UZAKI] I think I'll pass. We're
here with our family today.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.850
Oh, well give us your digits
and we'll meet up later.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.140
Lemme level with you,

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.060
my sister and I are
both in middle school,

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.890
and what you're doing
right now is illegal.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.690
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:06.730
[UZAKI] What? That's the best
you could come up with?

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:10.280
They're middle-schoolers?
I think I'm out, man.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.950
[UZAKI]
They bought it!

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.280
Yeah. Hey, why don't we touch
base again in five years or so.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.080
[FUJIO]
Lookin' for some action, punks?

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:17.910
[FLIRTS]
Hm?

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:20.040
Well, what about me?

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.080
[FLIRTS gasp]
We're so sorry, sir!

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.000
[sighs] That was close.

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:30.300
[FUJIO] Uh! Wait a second!
What was I thinking?

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.130
I'm letting my baby
girls wander around

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.010
unattended in nothing
but their swimsuits!

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:39.220
That's like tossing raw meat
into a den of lions

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.850
and expecting them
not to gobble it up!

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.270
I brought them here so they
could enjoy themselves!

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:45.810
Not so they could fall
into the hands

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:48.480
of some low-down
cheap little punks!

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.320
[FUJIO grunting]

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.530
Um, you good, Dad?

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:58.410
Hana! Yanagi! Are you all right?
They didn't hurt you, did they?

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:01.870
You'll never leave
my sight ever again.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:03.370
We're fine, Dad.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.410
Also, why is your
body silky smooth?

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.500
Did something happen?

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.710
[FUJIO]
That's not important right now!

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.670
Don't worry about us,
we're fine!

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.340
Trust me, we weren't going
anywhere with those guys.

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:15.470
It would be a crime! Right?

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:16.880
Yup.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:18.090
[FUJIO]
Eh?!

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.510
Point is, we know you're
never far away, Dad.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.980
Yeah! We can always count
on you to protect us!

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:27.810
[grunting] My baby girls!

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.310
[FLIRT A]
You're a mother of three?

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.400
[FLIRT B]
Nice!

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.490
Uhh, we may have a problem.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.400
Boys, I don't mean to be rude,
but I'm here with my family.

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:39.240
Does it have to be now?

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.780
You fiends!

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:44.870
[FLIRTS] Crap! Not again!
What is with that dude?

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:47.120
Kids these days!
They're all animals!

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:49.130
[YOUTH A]
Whoa! Feast your eyes, fellas!

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.130
[YOUTH B]
What a body.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.000
[YOUTH C]
Talk about perfection!

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:55.090
[FUJIO growls] Back for more
are you?! Well bring it on!

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:56.920
[YOUTH C]
He looks like a Greek god!

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:58.260
What's that?

00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.890
Your physique is incredible!

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.100
You must've worked so
hard to achieve that!

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.560
Eh?

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.890
[YOUTH C]
Would you...

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:07.600
...mind if we took some
pictures for inspiration?

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.610
First one's free!

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:14.530
[YOUTH C]
Yes!

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.530
[YOUTH D]
Thank you so much!

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.280
[NARRATOR] Yes, Tsuki
actually chose this man

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.200
as her life partner.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.330
[YOUTH C]
Can you look this way, sir?

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:31.540
[YOUTH D]
Love it! Next pose, please!

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:34.750
[YOUTH E]
Oh, hell yeah! Keep 'em coming!

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.170
[FUJIO]
Heh!

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.380
[YOUTH C]
What a smile!

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:38.670
[YOUTH D]
He's incredible!

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.880
[WOMAN A]
Oh my! Now that's a man!

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:44.390
[MAN A] You've gotta be
kidding me! Is he for real?

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:45.560
Insane.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.520
I feel like this is
scarring me somehow.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.060
[TSUKI]
That's your father for you.

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.520
He's putty in the
hands of anyone

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.190
who compliments his muscles.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.730
[YOUTH C] Man, that physique
really is something else.

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.950
[YOUTH D] Yeah, I just can't get
over how perfect your body is.

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:00.490
[YOUTH E]
We've been working out non-stop

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.320
trying to build six-packs,
but no luck.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:04.740
[FUJIO]
First rule of abs!

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:06.870
Fine-tuning your diet
will go a long way

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:08.370
towards getting those gains.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.790
Stop by my gym and we can help
you find the right balance

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.670
of proteins, fats, and carbs
for your body type!

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.380
[YANAGI]
First, he was modelling, and now

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.010
he's dishing out workout advice
and drumming up business.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.010
[TSUKI] Just like my
husband to find some way

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:22.720
to turn his day off into work.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.970
Welp, looks like he won't be
going anywhere for a while.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.140
I'm gonna go poke around
on my own for a little bit.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.140
All right, just be careful.
It's very slippery.

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:33.100
[UZAKI]
I know, Mom.

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:05.140
[UZAKI] Whoa. What
an amazing view! Holy--!

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.890
Thank you breeze for
reminding me it's winter.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:10.310
Huh?

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.770
[UZAKI]
Cave baths?

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.190
Don't mind if I do.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.200
I'm feeling like lunch.
Whattaya say?

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.870
[SAKURAI]
Works for me.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.790
[UZAKI]
S-Sakurai?

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.500
Uzaki!

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.130
What are you doing here?

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.590
Oh, hey! What are the odds!

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.920
You planned this,
didn't you Sakaki.

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.300
I knew it. I friggin' knew it.

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:45.590
What? No way!

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.050
I was completely
hands-off this time!

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:50.970
This is a hundred percent
unadulterated coincidence!

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.810
[UZAKI] See you say that, but
you have a track record buddy,

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:55.730
so I'm not buyin' it. Right?

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:57.440
Pretty much.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:01.480
You know I'm feeling a lack
of trust in this relationship.

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:03.450
[SAKURAI]
Uzaki.

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.110
Ah... Good.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.320
Guess all that swimming
the other day paid off.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:10.120
I'm not nervous anymore.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:14.000
Itsuhito surprised me with a
ticket, so I tagged along.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.380
I promise, no funny business.
We're just enjoying the park.

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:21.090
Okay. Well I happen to be
here with my family today!

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:22.250
Oh, cool.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:24.260
[UZAKI] This place sure
is fun, isn't it?

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.260
Never seen a hot spring
with a water slide before!

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:29.140
Have you been down
it yet, Sakurai?

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.680
[SAKURAI]
Uh, no.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.060
[UZAKI] Well if you want to,
we could go down it together.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.180
[SAKURAI]
What are you, my mother?

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:37.690
Ugh. Why are you grinning?

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:40.020
What? Did I say something funny?

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:42.610
Don't mind me. I'm just
appreciating the chemistry.

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:44.650
You know Saku's
been busy lately!

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:45.780
[SAKURAI]
Wait, I have?

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.110
Afraid so!

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.910
Whatever, that still
doesn't explain

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:50.450
why you're grinning at us.

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:54.660
Guilty. All right, my point was,
he's busy because you two

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:56.410
are always spending
time together. Get it?

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.920
[BOTH grunt]

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.130
In fact, if I'm being honest,
I feel as if I can barely

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:02.090
hold his attention
whenever you're around!

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.800
It's those rare moments
when you're apart

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.130
that he goes back to
acting like my friend.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.430
Don't get me wrong,
this isn't me complaining.

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:11.260
I'm just saying that you're
a much higher priority.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:13.310
It's been a little lonely
without him, sure,

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:16.180
but I'm really happy
for the two of you.

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:20.360
Buddy! What are you
doing to me? Shut it!

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.570
[laughs] Come on,
I'm just messing with you!

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:27.740
Still, I mean... I get it.
I didn't realize I was

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.160
taking Sakurai away
from you so much.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.200
I think you two
should hang out today.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.780
We can catch up another time.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:36.410
It's fine, really!

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.210
You sure? Well, okay then.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:42.090
How about this, why don't
I hang out with you guys?

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:45.590
That way nobody gets left out.

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:47.170
On second thought...

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.340
[UZAKI]
Hm?

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:49.720
[SAKURAI]
You're here with your family.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.470
It wouldn't be right to
get in the way of that.

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.470
Why don't you give me a shout
the next time you're free,

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.560
and we can hang out then.
How's that sound?

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.520
Sakurai...

00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.640
Saku's right.

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:00.980
You're here with
your family today,

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.190
you should spend time with them.

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:07.900
And since Kiri and Yanagi are
all done with their exams,

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:10.650
I thought why don't we
all somewhere together?

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:14.700
Hana! Yanagi! Are you all right?
They didn't hurt you, did they?

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:18.410
You'll never leave
my sight ever again.

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:22.380
Yeah, you're totally right.
I'll do that.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:25.750
But I am for sure gonna drag
you back here at some point.

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.300
Yeah? Okay. Sounds good.

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.130
[UZAKI] All right. Well, I guess
I'd better be getting back.

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.850
[SAKURAI] Sure. I guess
I'll see you at work?

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:36.850
You know it! Oh,
and one more thing.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:38.390
[SAKURAI]
Hm?

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:43.270
Ya got something to say? You
know, that thing you always say?

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:48.360
[SAKURAI grunts]
Uhh. C-Cute swimsuit today.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:54.450
[laughs] Thank you. Anyway,
have fun today. See ya later!

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:55.700
You bet.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.200
Ugh, you two are
positively hopeless.

00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:00.250
[SAKURAI]
Huh?

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:01.370
Ah!

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.170
Forgot you were there!

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:04.540
[SAKAKI]
Speaking of which...

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:06.000
What is it?

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:07.420
Oh, you know.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.170
Just thinking how it's getting
to be that time of year,

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.670
family visits and what not.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.880
Oh, right.

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:15.050
[SAKAKI]
You decide yet if you're going

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:16.470
home for the holidays?

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:18.850
[SAKURAI] Eh, I haven't really
given it much thought.

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:20.890
I guess I'll see whether
or not they ask me.

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:22.100
How 'bout you?

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.850
[SAKAKI chuckles]
Not if I can help it.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.440
[SAKURAI]
Well, time is of the essence.

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.360
If you plan on coming up with
an excuse they actually believe.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.570
[SAKAKI] Hey! We should do
the New Years shrine visit.

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:31.610
See the first sunrise.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.240
[SAKURAI]
Oh, hell yeah!

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.620
[SAKAKI]
You can bring Uzaki with you.

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.580
[YANAGI]
Oh, Hana's back.

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:44.920
[UZAKI laughs]

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.920
Oh wow, someone's
in a good mood.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.300
Absolutely! I'm having fun.
I'm glad we came here!

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.590
You know, me too!

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:54.010
The fresh air and
this beautiful view--

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.550
I could stay in this wonderful
warm water forever!

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.020
[UZAKI] You don't think you'd
get hungry after a while?

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.220
[TSUKI] Oh good point.
We should eat something.

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:05.730
[UZAKI] Cool, let's go call
our "bodyguard," shall we?

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:09.440
[YANAGI] Hey, Daddy!
We're gonna head out, okay?

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:29.290
[KIRI]
Hey, Mom? Is dinner soon?

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:30.630
[TSUKI]
Oh! That's right.

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:32.510
I'll get it started
in just a little bit.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:34.340
[YANAGI] Here, Kiri,
eat these in the meantime.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:36.590
We got them at the hot spring.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.100
Sounds like you guys really
enjoyed yourselves today.

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.680
[UZAKI]
It was so much fun!

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:45.980
[YANAGI]
Yeah, you would of liked it.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.730
You should have come with us.

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:49.730
We spent the whole day
soaking in hot water

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:51.570
while Dad modeled
for a group of boys

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:53.110
who were obsessed
with his muscles.

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:55.400
They did a photo shoot
and everything.

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:57.530
[KIRI] Wait, I'm sorry.
What was this trip?

00:19:57.610 --> 00:19:58.740
[YANAGI]
Oh yeah, and these guys

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.330
were flirting with Hana and me.

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:01.740
Flirting?

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:04.660
[UZAKI] It was nothin'.
Dad chased 'em off right away.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:06.960
You should of seen the
looks on their faces.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.790
I told them that Hana
was in middle school,

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.800
and they actually believed me.
They backpedaled so fast!

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.050
By the way, remind me
to get you back for that.

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.590
You've got a lotta nerve
trying to pass

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:17.470
a 20-year-old off as
a middle-schooler.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.800
You're lucky that worked!

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.140
Sounds like you need
to get over it.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.680
Huh...

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:23.890
[FUJIO]
Hm?

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:26.810
Anyway! We should spend
the night next time!

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:28.100
How does that sound?

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:30.190
Kiri, would you come with
us if we went back?

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:33.190
Sure. If it's that
much fun, I guess it

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:35.530
wouldn't be the end of the
world if I went with you.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:36.780
[FUJIO]
Yes!

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.820
Yeah! I'm in!
How soon can we go?

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:41.530
[FUJIO]
That's fantastic, Kiri!

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.410
Your dear old dad will
take you whenever you like!

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:46.790
[FUJIO]
Today's trip with the girls

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:48.540
turned out to be
a massive success!

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.080
I can't wait for next time!

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:53.710
We'll have a family trip
with the entire Uzaki clan!

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.460
Ah, dammit! Now I really wish
I'd gone with you today!

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.760
Hey, Dad? Let's not
wait too long, okay?

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.510
How about next week?
I'll skip club!

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.100
Someone's excited!

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.890
[UZAKI]
I thought you hated the idea.

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:07.270
Yeah, what the heck changed?

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:10.560
[laughs] And why so soon?

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.980
Think about it!
You said Hana and Yanagi

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:16.190
were getting hit on, and
they're runts! I'll be a magnet!

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.150
Heck, I might even stand
a chance of getting

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.610
hit on by a college girl or two!

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:25.950
Oh, man, this is gonna be
awesome! I can't wait!

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.410
[UZAKI, YANAGI grunt]

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.750
[KIRI] Ow! What the heck?
What was that for?

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:33.170
[UZAKI] So little man,
you think we're runts, huh?

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.170
[YANAGI]
This right here?

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:35.750
This is why girls
don't like you.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.630
[FUJIO] These trips are
supposed to be about family!

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:40.010
[TSUKI]
There they go again.

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:41.630
Another day in the life
of the Uzaki's.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.300
[UZAKI] Well this runt
is about to show you

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:44.890
just how much damage
these hands can do...

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:48.270
[TSUKI] What a family I have.
Wouldn't change a thing.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.930
[KIRI laughing]
What?

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.440
I'm plenty tall!

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.560
Whatever, I'll get a girlfriend
with or without your help!

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:59.610
[FUJIO] My beautiful family!
Ripping apart at the seams.

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.830
[CATS screech]
