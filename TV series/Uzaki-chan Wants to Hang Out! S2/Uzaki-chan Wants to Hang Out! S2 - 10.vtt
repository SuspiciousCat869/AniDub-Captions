WEBVTT

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.630
[WOMAN A]
It's that time.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.470
What should we do
for Christmas this year?

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.440
[UZAKI] It's starting to feel
like the holidays, isn't it?

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.730
Everyone's in the
mood to celebrate.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.730
Speaking of which,
I've heard someone's

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.810
got a spicy date on the books.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.320
Isn't that right, Ito?

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.780
Let's not make it sound
more steamy than it is.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.700
My boyfriend booked a
table at a restaurant

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.660
and invited me to join him
for a nice dinner, that's all.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.910
You say that now, but things
could heat up after dessert.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.240
Enough about my yuletide plans,
what about yours?

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.040
You and Sakurai
doing anything fun?

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.870
You guys really are like
two peas in a pod, you know.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.630
That's what everybody says!

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.840
[UZAKI] Except my schedule's
as open as a cooked clam.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.880
It's okay though.
Sooner or later,

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.430
Sakurai's bound to
invite me to something!

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.850
I'm gonna deck his halls
with so much Christmas spirit

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.560
he won't know what hit him!

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.860
[UZAKI] I'm gonna start
prepping the ingredients.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.080
You mind going ahead and
setting the table for us?

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.790
[SAKURAI]
I'm on it.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.920
[UZAKI laughs]
He can't take his eyes off me!

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.460
He's not even trying to
hide it, and I know why.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.300
It's because he wants
to invite me over

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.670
for Christmas fun
times, obviously!

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.350
Look at that thirsty gaze.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.600
That's the face of a man
longing for someone special

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.100
to keep him warm during
a cold winter night.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.890
Well fine by me, loner boy.
If that's how it is,

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.650
I guess I'll spend
the holidays with you.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:08.980
Just quit beating
around the bush

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.980
and tell me what
you want already.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.320
Wait. What does he want?

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.150
Whoa, now that I think about it,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.620
I'm actually getting sort
of nervous about Sakurai.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.120
There's a real chance he
might make a move on me.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.450
What if he turns into
some kind of beast?

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.790
Nah, there's no way.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.420
At least, not from what
I've seen of him. Ugh...

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.920
Then again, he might be
a gentleman about it.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.220
See something you like,
Uzaki babes?

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.010
[UZAKI]
How would I react?

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.630
Wait, that's not something
a gentleman would say.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.850
Dinner preparations
are complete, madame.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.010
Right this way.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.230
[UZAKI] No, too formal.
He isn't a butler.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.600
Wassup girl! Hope you're
ready to jingle those bells

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.230
and get litty tonight, yeahyuh!

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.650
[UZAKI] What? He'd never
pull something like that!

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.690
Okay Hana, enough
with the daydreams.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.410
Calm down for a sec.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.410
There's no reason
to assume the worst.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.530
I've known the guy for so long.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.620
He's never been the type of
person to act aggressively.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.080
Still though, it could get
awkward. Wait a minute.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.340
Wasn't I just implying
that Sakurai's practically

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.130
the most harmless creature
in the whole world?

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.420
He is. So what's got me freaking
out all of a sudden?

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.220
Oh no. What's going on?

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.350
Don't give into such
impure thoughts, Hana.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.930
He's a wholesome boy with
nothing but good intentions!

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.480
[UZAKI] That's right!
You hang in there, angel me!

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.980
Oh, please! He's a horny loser
like all the other guys!

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.530
[UZAKI] Where did all
these devils come from?

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.030
My inner conscience
is totally corrupt!

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.240
Fess up, you've been
lusting after him, too!

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.570
Why would you even say that?

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.250
I would never entertain
the possibility

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.710
of doing such naughty
things with another person.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.080
Naughty things like what?

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.330
Spill the deets, girl!

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.300
C'mon cutie, don't be shy!

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.550
I'm not sure we should
talk about this, so...

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.970
Take her down!

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.430
[screaming]

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.550
[UZAKI] No. Could it be
possible? At some point,

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.390
have I been the one to
catch feelings for him?

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.640
[SAKURAI]
Yo, Uzaki.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.510
[screaming] What's the
big idea, creepypants?

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.270
I'm not finished
chopping the veggies!

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.640
Sorry, my bad.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.610
I wasn't trying to rush
dinner or anything.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.150
Actually, there was something
I wanted to check, first.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:23.490
Would you mind if I asked
you to take your top off?

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.280
[UZAKI gasps]
Hold on.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.000
Is he trying to unwrap
this box before Christmas?

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.500
No way. He's not that
type of guy, remember?

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.470
Well I guess,
if that's what you want.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.550
[UZAKI] Just breathe.
This is totes normal.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.770
We've never done anything
like this before...

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.110
[UZAKI] Still something feels
off about this. And yet...

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.400
[SAKURAI]
Don't move.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.830
[UZAKI squeaks]

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.880
[SAKURAI]
Stay right there.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.590
Sakurai?

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.010
That shirt looked familiar and
I could've sworn it was mine.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.180
Eh?

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.970
Oh. No yeah,
it is yours actually.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.360
Guess I've been wearin' it for
so long, I forgot I borrowed it.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.150
[SAKURAI] Well, whatever.
Just make sure you

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.280
give it back to me at
some point, ya thief.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.360
Wait a minute, why are you
getting upset with me

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.610
when I'm the one
whose clothes were

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.900
stolen away by a
deceitful friend?

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.700
Look, I didn't steal
your stupid duds.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:47.910
I only borrowed them,

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.120
which means I'm gonna
give 'em back, okay?

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.410
I'll even throw 'em
in the wash

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.280
and bring 'em over
tomorrow if you'll shut up!

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.830
Thanks, I appreciate it.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.830
They're oversized on me and
super comfy, but fine, I get it.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.670
It's your stuff and I
shouldn't hold onto it.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.710
Besides, none of it even
smells like you anymore,

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.220
so I'm happy to
part ways with it.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.680
Were you sniffing on my clothes?

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.550
Could you not.
That's embarrassing.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.690
On second thought, just
forget I said anything

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.060
and I promise I won't
mention it ever again.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.640
I didn't know it was such a
sensitive subject! Sheesh.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.860
[UZAKI] And here I thought
I'd be taking the initiative.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.860
So much for that!

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.480
This is far from over, though.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:27.490
Tomorrow, I'm gonna teach him
a lesson he won't forget!

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.240
[NARRATOR] Soon enough,
the next day arrived.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.540
[gasping]

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.540
[UZAKI laughs] Are you ready to
get punished, you filthy degen?

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.660
No. Have mercy, Uzaki.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.880
Do anything but that.
I'm begging you!

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.170
Heh. Why would I ease up
when I'm having so much fun?

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.640
Especially since that pitiful
face you're making is hilarious.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.470
Anyway, it's too late
to stop now.

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.430
You've no one to blame
but yourself.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.890
[SAKURAI]
Wait, you've gotta hear me out.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:55.220
I'm completely lost here.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.560
I have no idea what
I've done to upset you!

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.770
C'mon, this isn't fair. At least
tell me what I did wrong!

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.490
No more talking, you pervert!

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.740
Why do you keep on calling me
those weird names?

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:05.900
I'm so confused!

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.830
Just shut up and take it,
you lowly worm!

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.500
[UZAKI]
Presenting The Atrocity!

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.080
Hope ya got popcorn ready!

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.250
[laughing]

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.460
[NARRATOR] Poor Hana had
found herself disquieted

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:24.040
by Sakurai's inadvertently
suggestive behavior.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:26.170
Though it was merely
a misunderstanding,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.140
the vengeful maiden's fragile
heart demanded retribution.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.720
And what better way to retaliate

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.180
than with a forced viewing
of a horror film?

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.510
It was a fearsome
punishment indeed!

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.850
Human beings truly are

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:40.430
the most petty and foolish
creatures, aren't they?

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.310
[UZAKI]
Here we go. Time to hit play!

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.410
[sweeping sound continues]

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.380
[sweeping sound continues]

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:05.460
[HORROR LOUSY CAT screams]

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.390
[UZAKI screaming]

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.720
Why're you the one screaming?
Wasn't I supposed to do that?

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.590
You might not believe this,

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.470
but I've never seen
a scary movie.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.610
No wonder you hate them so much.
I was just trying to troll you,

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.440
but I had no idea they'd
be so terrifying!

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.060
I hate to rub it in,
but you really are

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.940
the queen of playing yourself,
you know that?

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.740
What I wanna know is
how you're managing

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.740
to not freak out while
watching this since you said

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.070
you couldn't handle sitting
through these types of films!

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.000
[SAKURAI] I dunno. I mean,
it is really frightening.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.620
But the story's
surprisingly interesting.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.200
Plus, seeing you jump out
of your skin like that

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:42.670
is kind of entertaining.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.790
Do you mean to tell me I'm
the only one who's actually

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.510
losing it? That's not fair
at all, you traitor!

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:48.840
[SAKURAI]
Who's the traitor here?

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.340
If her stupid plan worked out,

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.010
she'd be laughing at me right
now. Talk about nerve.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:55.630
If you're really that scared,
we could always stop watching.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.600
I'm gonna grit my teeth
and keep watching

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.060
this thing until you crap
your pants at least once.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:01.180
And besides, I don't wanna be

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.060
a buzzkill if you're
enjoying yourself.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.140
[SAKURAI] Uzaki sticks to her
guns about the strangest things.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.940
--[WOMAN B screams]
--[UZAKI screams]

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.160
[SAKURAI] Whoa! You're a
little close, don't you think?

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.030
I'm sorry, but I tend
to startle easily

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:14.820
when I'm panicking
for my life, okay?

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:16.450
[screams]

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:17.990
[UZAKI screaming]

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.580
Could you not invade my personal
space, you freaking weirdo?

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.000
You're gonna stretch
my favorite hoodie out!

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:26.870
You look like you're
gonna keel over.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.590
I feel like I've run a marathon.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.840
I think I literally almost
scared myself to death

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.630
since my heart was racing
a mile a minute

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.390
like it was about to
burst out of my chest?

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:37.560
So remind me to never
do that again please.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.020
Well thankfully
the movie's over,

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.440
so you can stop
shaking like a leaf.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.900
And it's getting pretty late,
so we should call it now.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.860
Let's go, crybaby.
I'll walk you to the station.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.190
I'm not leaving.

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:50.520
[gasps]

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:51.530
I'm afraid.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.030
[SAKURAI]
What?

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:54.740
I'm not ready to leave your
place yet cause I'm afraid.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.070
[SAKURAI]
What are you, five?

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.120
[UZAKI] Shut up!
It wasn't a problem before,

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.490
but now I'm worried
there's gonna be

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.830
something lurking
around to gut me!

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.080
Guess that movie
really got to you, huh.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.120
Do you want me
to call you a taxi?

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:07.630
[UZAKI]
No way, you can't do that!

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.090
What if the cabdriver
ends up being a ghost?

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.760
[SAKURAI]
That's doesn't even make sense!

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.130
How bout we ask
one of your folks

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:15.800
to come and pick you up
or something?

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.960
[UZAKI]
Are you kidding?

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:18.970
One of them might be
a ghost in disguise!

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:21.680
[SAKURAI] You seriously need
to check your imagination!

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:22.940
I'm begging you Sakurai,

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.400
please let me spend
the night with you!

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.190
I'll go home first thing in
the morning and I promise

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.810
I'll never watch another
stupid horror flick ever again!

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.820
Ugh, really? I've got
an early day tomorrow.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.280
Would it help if I
made you breakfast

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.110
and packed you a
bento lunch to take?

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.370
If it'll get you to stop
groveling then fine,

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:39.660
you can stay over.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.870
Yay, you're a lifesaver.
Thanks to you,

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:43.870
I'm pretty sure I won't
get haunted now!

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:45.620
Good thing my
apartment's ghost free.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.380
I'll tell my parents we're
having a slumber party!

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.210
[NARRATOR] Sakurai failed
to notice that he was

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:53.340
hopelessly conditioned
by Hana's cooking.

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:57.560
[UZAKI]
Oh, you bought another futon.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.590
Yeah, for when I
have guests over.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.470
[UZAKI] That's cute, but you do
realize that I'm the only one

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.770
who'll be using it, right?
I mean, it's not like you have

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.270
any friends who'll
spend the night.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:08.940
Which basically
makes this my futon.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.270
[SAKURAI]
Shut up!

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.820
[UZAKI] You can put up a
front as much as you like,

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.070
but there's no use
denying the facts.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.780
You got all this
prepared for me.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.490
I know you can be a
gentleman sometimes,

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.030
but this is on another level!

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:21.030
That's enough yammering.
Go get ready for bed!

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.830
Kay!

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.960
[SAKURAI] Man, Uzaki sleeping
over is starting to become

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.500
a given. That's one less
boundary between us.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:34.210
And I still haven't figured out
how I feel about that yet.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.260
It's just, you're
really special to me.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.640
[UZAKI] Hey, Sakurai!
Make sure you don't

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.140
suddenly turn the lights off
on me while I'm showering.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.060
I'm not in the mood
for any pranks.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.060
[SAKURAI] The only person
who'd do that is you.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.390
[UZAKI] Oh. That reminds me,
no peeping either.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.690
I know I'm stacked,
but show some respect.

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:53.980
If I catch you slobberin',
you're in for a clobberin'.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:56.110
Got that, shifty-eyes?

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:58.650
[UZAKI shrieks]
I can't see anything.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:02.410
What did I just tell you?
Turn those back on!

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:06.750
[SAKURAI] Hm? Oh right,
that's Uzaki's bag.

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.120
I bet she bought some extra
groceries to take home

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:11.050
before she decided to
stay here for the night,

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.460
so I better stash it in the
fridge before it goes bad--

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:23.050
[SAKURAI screaming]

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.260
I'm sorry, I kinda
started poking around

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:27.930
in your stuff while
you were showering.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.310
[SAKURAI]
Holy mackerel. That bra, tho!

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.020
Oh. It's no biggie, these
things happen sometimes.

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.600
You were trying to
look out for ya girl,

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:35.940
so I totally understand.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.770
Next time I'll remember
to hide it someplace

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.150
that won't be as obvious.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.160
Right. Hide it. That's normal.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.910
I can explain. I thought I'd
bring some spare undies in case

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.910
I needed to crash a
few nights in a row.

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:48.870
To be honest though,
I sure didn't imagine

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:51.290
I'd have to start putting
them to use this soon!

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.410
Why are you like this?

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.210
I've housed your
crap once before

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:56.290
and I don't wanna have
to go through that again!

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.880
Wait a minute, what are you
wearing right now?

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.460
What do you mean?

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.840
I didn't pack anything
comfy to sleep in tonight.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:05.260
So, I dug around in your dresser

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:08.810
and found this old shirt
along with these shorts.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.770
[SAKURAI] How do I put this,
those aren't outside shorts.

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:15.270
Those are actually my boxers.
So, yeah.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.450
[UZAKI gasping]

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:20.070
[UZAKI]
I'll definitely make sure

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:21.820
to bring PJs with me next time.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.690
[SAKURAI]
Please do.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.870
[UZAKI] Sorry. I should've
asked you first.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:28.330
Lemme go wash 'em!

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:29.990
[SAKURAI]
She ran away.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.830
I know I said otherwise
but maybe I'd be better off

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:36.250
if I let her keep
more of her junk here.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.460
[SAKURAI] Really, a phone call?
At this hour?

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:40.930
[UZAKI]
You know what?

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:43.010
I might as well wash these
bath towels while I'm at it!

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:44.510
Knock yourself out.

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:47.090
Hello, this is Sakurai.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.520
[SHIRO]
Am I hearing things?

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.640
Or do you have a girl
over there right now?

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.850
And here I was convinced

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:55.890
you were too frigid
for your own good.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:57.650
[UZAKI laughs]

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.400
[SHIRO] Don't get me wrong,
I think it's great.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.190
Sounds like you're finally
settling into college life.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.450
I'm proud of you, son!

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.240
Don't worry though,
I won't tell Mom.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.700
Just, uh... be safe,
you get it.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.410
[SAKURAI]
You can think whatever,

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:12.330
but it's not like that.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:16.370
What do you want, anyway?
Go on, spit it out, Dad.

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.750
[whistling]

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.590
[ASAI] Heyo, ready
to get your drink on?

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.810
Still gotta wait for
Uzaki and Saku first.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:31.680
I love a holiday nightcap,
and with a little liquid courage

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:33.560
to get the tensions building
and the confessions

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.140
spilling right before
cuffing season.

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.820
You couldn't ask for a more
titillating way to finish out

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.440
the end of the year!

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.730
[ASAI laughing]

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.030
[BOTH laughing]

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:44.900
[UZAKI]
Yo! Sorry I'm late!

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:47.830
[SAKAKI] Huh? I thought Saku
was coming with you.

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:49.370
There was a change of plans.

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:51.330
[ASAI] Sakurai went
to visit his family?

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:53.250
That seems kinda random.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:54.870
Yeah, I thought the same thing.

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:57.500
Apparently, he hasn't gone
back home in two years.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:58.790
He got a phone call telling him

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.880
to drop the whole
prodigal son act.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.050
[ASAI] Two years?
I'm sort of impressed.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.720
I suppose even a loner boy
like Sakurai has his limits.

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:21.860
[SAKURAI]
I'm home.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.240
Hey, Mom, it's good to see you.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.320
Fancy seeing you here, Shinichi.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:30.240
It really has been
quite a while, I suppose.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.240
Were you planning to spend
yet another Christmas alone

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:33.920
before we called you?

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:36.540
I didn't know you enjoyed
living on your own that much.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:38.210
Right. I'm sorry for not

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:40.130
coming back to visit
you guys sooner.

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:42.920
And what can I say, I kinda like
having my personal space.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.500
Before we keep on
talking though.

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.930
You mind if we address
the elephant in the room?

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:50.930
As in the infant you're holding.
Are you nannying?

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.850
It's not nannying
when it's your own child.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:55.850
Huh.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:57.140
Hold on a second.

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:59.980
Shinichi, did you...
did you seriously not know

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.560
that you have a baby sister?

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:05.400
I leave home for two freaking
years and now I have a sister?

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.070
[SAKURAI sputtering]

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:09.280
Why are you yelling?

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.860
I'm the one who
should be upset here.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:13.750
Didn't your father tell you
anything about this?

00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:15.250
No, not exactly.

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:17.370
He said I should try not to
get overwhelmed with school

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:19.700
and it was understandable if
I didn't bend over backwards

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:20.620
to come back home.

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:22.590
Huh? Is that all he said?

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:25.510
He told me he was going to call
you and fill you in. But...

00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:27.630
--What?
--I can see that didn't happen.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:30.420
No, it did not.
I get the gist, though.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:32.640
[SHIRO] Well look what
the cat dragged in.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.260
Were you gonna stand
guard by the doorway

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.390
for your entire visit?

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:41.060
Don't glare at me, it was just
a joke. Welcome home, son.

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.930
Hello, Dad.

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:47.150
So, there's something I
wanted to ask you guys.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.150
Something that's been
bugging me about Sakurai.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.660
Ask away, friend!

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.580
[SAKAKI] Saku's not even here
and she can't stop talking

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.620
about him. We should totally
go drinking more often.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.080
Not that it matters, but do you
know why that nerd chose

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.660
to live alone? I could be wrong,
but I'm pretty sure

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:04.170
his parents live
fairly close to campus.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:05.880
Well if you both went
to the same high school,

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.920
then that should be the case,
don't you think?

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.130
And striking it out on your
own while you're in college

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.180
can be super rough
on the pocketbook.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.060
It'd make more sense for him
to commute from home.

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:16.520
Is there a reason
he's making things

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.890
more complicated for himself?

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:21.220
[SAKURAI] Okay. So,
let me get this straight.

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:23.600
I've been living all by
myself and the reason

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:26.690
you wanted me to do that was
to help me "build character,"

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:28.650
in case college wasn't
enough to cut it?

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:29.860
That's right, bucko.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.400
It was also an excuse
to kick you out

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.490
so your mom and I could have
the house to ourselves.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.280
I figured it was time for us
to relive our newlywed days.

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.870
You had me move out so you
could hook up with Mom?

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:39.870
[SHIRO chuckles]

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:41.740
[SAKURAI]
Ugh. You suck, old man.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.870
[SHIRO] I just finished
catching up with Shinichi.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.170
He says he's too
busy to come home.

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:47.880
I guess that means
we'll be spending another

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.000
New Year's by
ourselves, my dear.

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:53.760
I bet he's living it up at those
college parties every day.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.880
I basically intercepted
each of your mom's attempts

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.020
to contact you. You know,
to keep you away.

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:01.230
If you were gone
we could get frisky.

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:03.100
That is, until
Nodoka came along.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.720
Ah... It's a real shame

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.690
I couldn't make her
pamper me forever!

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:08.520
You're disgusting,
you know that?

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:10.990
So you're still keeping
the old spark alive, huh?

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:13.780
I suppose that's not the worst
fact to learn about your folks.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.610
Wait. Mom,
how old are you again?

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.200
I think I should be
turning 50 next year?

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.660
Interesting age to have a kid.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.660
But it wouldn't be the
strangest thing to happen.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.040
No regrets, but I'll admit

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.660
we might've gotten
a little too excited.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:29.290
Honestly Mom, I gotta say
I'm kind of impressed.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:30.880
Aw, how sweet.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.880
I'm pretty sure that compliment
wasn't directed at you, geezer.

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:35.510
Anyway, it didn't last.

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.180
Your mom was starting
to get real sad.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.680
She was wondering
why her baby boy

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.010
hadn't come by to say hi
to her baby girl yet.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:43.770
I wound up having to chase
your butt over here in the end.

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.100
You're welcome, by the way.

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:46.780
But why did you think
it was a smart move

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:49.190
to cover up such big news
in the first place?

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:51.310
What the heck were you
thinking, you clown?

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.690
Surprise, surprise.

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.950
There you go with the logical
arguments, just like your mom.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:59.450
I bet your classmates get
a kick out of that energy.

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.030
Talk about a buzzkill.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.040
Hey. My classmates like me!

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.710
Dear, Shinichi can't help it

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:06.750
if he prioritizes his
own needs over the needs

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:09.290
of those around him.
He learned it from watching you.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.590
Gee thanks.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:12.880
Ha, ha! Like that?
How's it feel to get mom'd?

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.880
[sighs] Okay, that's enough
fun and games now.

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:17.720
Imma start heading back home.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.930
Come on, don't be a party
pooper. You just got here,

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:24.060
so take a load off and hang
around with us for a while.

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.730
It's funny you should
say that when you're

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:27.400
the genius who's been
keeping me away!

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.980
Oh, don't be silly now.
I'm about to make us some dinner

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.020
and I insist that you at least
spend the night, okay?

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:33.860
Right, boy,
listen to your mother!

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.440
You're not giving me
much of a choice here.

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:39.490
Why don't you make yourself
useful and get acquainted

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:41.660
with your baby sister
while I'm in the kitchen?

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.030
You'll have lots
of fun together.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.290
Will we though?

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:47.040
Looky Nodoka! It's your
big brother Shinichi!

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.620
Uh. Hey, I feel like this
is a really bad idea

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:51.670
considering that I don't
know how to hold a baby!

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.130
Support her neck and
hold her from the bottom.

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:57.380
Don't worry, you'll be fine.
Nodoka's a lil trouper.

00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:59.390
She isn't timid like
you were at her age.

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:00.970
Anyway, I'll get the bath going.

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:02.840
Just holler if you
need something.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.680
What if I drop her?

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:17.240
Can you believe I'm
21 years older than you.

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.200
Sakurai gets me so frustrated

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.990
I could punch a
hole in the wall!

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:25.490
He's always inconsiderate,
he never keeps me in the loop,

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:28.750
and he writes everybody off
like an uptight middle manager!

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.580
Sometimes I don't know why I
even bother with that loser.

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:33.760
When is he gonna realize
there are people in his life

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.590
who actually give
a crap about him?

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.590
That stupid meathead
manchild dork.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.720
Can't believe Christmas
is right around the corner.

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:49.270
[ASAI] It looks like
Hana's getting schwasty.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.100
You think she'd be
in a better mood.

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:52.480
[SAKAKI]
She seems completely fed up

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.400
with how slow things are
going with her Casanova.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.570
You know what,
whenever Saku comes back

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:58.820
we should go out
for drinks again

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.030
so you can tell him
everything to his face.

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:02.070
[SAKAKI grunts]

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.580
[ASAI grunts]

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.120
Not to change the subject,
but I've always been curious

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.290
to learn what you were
like back in high school.

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.460
You wanna give us the backstory?

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:11.670
[UZAKI]
Huh...?
