WEBVTT

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.930
How's it hanging Uzaki?
I thought I'd swing by

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.430
to see how you were doing
on my day off.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.180
So, are you working hard
or hardly working?

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.110
[UZAKI grunting]

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.980
Ok-ay. Just keep giving me
the cold shoulder

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.150
like you've been
doing since yesterday.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.650
She seems upset.
What'd you do this time?

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.660
Really, again? There's always
something weird going on

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.620
whenever you're around,
isn't there? Gyah.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.700
Whoa, wait, can we
back up for a second?

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.250
I have no idea what I'm
even being accused of.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.500
Look, the poor boy's as
clueless as ever. Ya see?

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.620
Not surprised. Nope.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.130
[BOTH sigh]

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.880
[SAKURAI]
What the heck's going on?

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.550
When did I become
public enemy number one?

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.680
Hello there.
Just thought I'd pop in.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.610
[TSUKI] I've noticed that
Hana's been in a bit of a funk

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.480
since yesterday. I was worried,
so I thought I'd make sure

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.990
she wasn't causing
any problems for you.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.910
That's very kind of you,
but there's no need to worry.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.540
She's been her usual
cheery self with the patrons.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.700
[SAKURAI grunting]

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.670
It's a different story
with that jerk face, though.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.420
Well that sounds like quite
an unfortunate situation.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.750
Knowing Sakurai, he probably
brought it onto himself,

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.090
so don't feel
too badly for him.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.600
I've been trying to figure out
what I did wrong.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.730
I've got nothin'.
Mind giving me a clue already?

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.850
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Actually, if Hana's this upset,

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.730
things must be getting serious.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.150
[ASAI]
Wait a minute.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.690
[CAFÉ OWNER] Haven't we
been down this road before?

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.730
[ASAI]
This is giving me déjà vu.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.820
I think I remember
Hana's mood changing

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.320
right around dinnertime.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.860
The three of us were having
a nice little cooking lesson

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.080
in the kitchen.
It seemed like everything

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.210
was going well enough.
That is, at first.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.500
But when we
finished making the dish

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.210
it was as if this dark
cloud fell over her.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.420
When I asked her what was wrong,
she said it was nothing

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.460
and just shrugged me away.
So, I really am sorry.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.890
That kind of attitude doesn't
belong in the workplace.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.590
[CAFÉ OWNER]
No need to apologize.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.810
[ASAI] That's right. Not like
it's your fault, after all.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.180
What a shame.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.810
Guess you don't know what's
wrong either, Ms. Tsuki?

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.310
No clue.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.060
You kidding me? Do you two even
hear yourselves right now?

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.350
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Seriously!

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.480
I beg your pardon?

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.310
Yeah, what are you
yelling about?

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.030
I realized what's upset Hana!

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.820
[SAKURAI]
Wait, really? Uzaki's mad 'cause

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.240
she's the only one I don't
call by her first name?

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.700
Well actually, there's
a good reason for that.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.160
I've never liked calling
girls by their first name.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.500
Feels kinda intimate.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.710
No crap, I know that.
So, explain.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.080
How come you're fine feeling
intimate with my mom?

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.590
If you're gonna do that
with anyone, it should be me!

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.260
Hey, your phrasing...

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.720
[TSUKI]
Oh, my. This is so awkward.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.510
[CAFÉ OWNER]
To think he became this familiar

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.180
with her mother so quickly.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.800
[ASAI] All while he's still
being wishy-washy

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.270
with Hana herself.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.600
It's obvious which woman's
getting her bread buttered.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.180
[BOTH]
Heh, heh and it ain't Hana!

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.270
[ASAI] Aw, I can't help feeling
bad for the poor girl, though.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.320
I mean, Sakurai even
calls me by my first name.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.740
[ASAI] Right, then. About time
I toss our friends a lifeline.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.530
Well, this means you
better hurry and get over

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.990
your complex about first names

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.990
for the sake of your
friendship with Hana.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.080
But how do I do that?

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.200
With some old-fashioned
exposure therapy.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.580
Starting now,
you can't use last names

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.420
anywhere within
these café walls!

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.670
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.250
Oh relax, it's just for today.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.130
I'm sure you can handle
that much, right Sakurai?

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.760
Don't look so enthusiastic.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.930
And how do you expect me
to participate when

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.850
I don't even know the
bossman's first name?

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.100
Just call me Akihiko, dear boy!

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.140
[SAKURAI] Why are you glistening
all of a sudden, Akihiko.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.320
[CAFÉ OWNER] Now don't
get distracted, Shinichi.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.400
[SAKURAI grunts]

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.940
There's somebody
else here who needs

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.370
your attention more than I do.
And she's right behind you.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:21.950
[SAKURAI grunts]

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.030
[UZAKI growls]

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.040
You got this, Shinichi.
I believe in you!

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.660
Go show 'em who's
boss, Shinichi!

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.700
We'll be here cheering
you on together, Shin.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.580
Each of us rooting for you.
Eyes on the prize!

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.720
[SAKURAI]
Yeah, yeah, yuk it up.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.340
[SAKURAI]
Okay, first things first.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.670
I owe you an apology.
I did the same damn thing

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.890
all over again and I probably
upset you again too.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.230
Which was a sucky thing to do.
I'm really sorry.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.770
Know what, Sakurai?

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.060
I can tell you're trying to
avoid saying my name.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.900
Consider me unimpressed.
Try again, dummy.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.610
[SAKURAI growls]
I'm sorry. Hana.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.790
[laughs] What was that again?

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.660
You're gonna have to
speak a little louder.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.740
[SAKURAI grumbles]
I'm said I'm sorry, Hana.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:12.870
Louder, please.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.960
[SAKURAI]
Sorry Hana.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.210
With feeling!

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:16.960
[SAKURAI]
Please forgive me, Hana.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.250
Oh, that's more like it!
Now we're talking.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.180
I swear I could almost
taste your regret

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.350
in that last apology.
Okiedokie, I forgive you, pal.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.520
For real, though.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.520
It may be awkward for a bit,
but I prefer it this way.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.640
Thanks, Sakurai.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.980
[SAKURAI grunts]

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.110
Oh wait, since everyone else is
calling you by your first name,

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.530
maybe I should start
calling you Shinichi, too.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.570
Hmm... What's wrong, Shinichi?

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.900
Did I hit a nerve, 'cause
you're blushing really hard.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.450
I'm not blushing, I'm just hot.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.530
Yeah right, ya liar. Your face
is red as a beet, Shinichi!

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.910
You just need glasses!

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.500
[UZAKI] And you're adorable
when you're not being

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.080
a grumpy old loner, ya know?

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.010
[SAKURAI]
Stop looking at me!

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.710
What's wrong, Shinichi Sakurai?

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.210
[SAKURAI]
Hey, cut it out!

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.470
Mission accomplished.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.720
It seems they've
finally made up.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.220
Those two are something.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.720
Hana says they've practically
known each other for ages,

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.050
and yet all this fuss
about names.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.180
My, I can't help but think

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.110
they've got their priorities
out of order.

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.360
[CAFÉ OWNER]
And I can't help but feel

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.480
that she's still taking things
the wrong way.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.900
Mrs. Uzaki, you and I need to
have a talk one of these days.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.150
A serious talk.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:27.400
[UZAKI]
Shinichi! Shinichi! Shinichi...

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.870
Shinichi! Shinichi!

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.290
[SAKURAI]
Leave me alone!

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:37.120
[gasps] My Saku-zaki
senses are tingling!

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.300
[SAKURAI]
Oh man, I'm exhausted.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.550
That was a whole new level

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.630
of psychic damage
I took back there.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.560
Yo Shinichi, how's it going?
Hello Shinichi-beechi!

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.350
Shinichi! Shinichi! Shinichi!

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.520
[SAKURAI] And she's been
bullying me with my own name

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.150
ever since. I suppose I
only have myself to blame.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.730
[SAKURAI]
Oh, hey. A free gym trial.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.280
[SAKURAI grunting]

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.280
[SAKURAI] It's been a while
since I've worked up a sweat.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:15.120
Casual solo activities have
always been a thing I enjoy.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.620
Not to mention they're perfect
for blowing off steam.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.710
[UZAKI laughing]

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:22.710
[SAKURAI]
All right. Time for chest.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.380
Yo. You there, with the
sharp-looking eagle eyes.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.960
Were you about to hit
this bench, kiddo?

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.340
No need to do it alone.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.350
Better to be safe and
find a spotter first.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.850
[FUJIO] Nice. Looks like
someone's using their trial!

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.310
[KUROKI]
Hey there, Fuji.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.390
[SAKURAI]
Huh?

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.180
Don't mind me, I'm just
a trainer here.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:41.020
Actually, as long as you're cool
with it, why don't I spot you?

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.770
Bar workouts can be
dangerous sometimes,

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.110
so it's never a bad idea
to have a buddy.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.400
[NARRATOR] Ah, the time-honored
fitness trope.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:51.620
A group of gym rats looking to
adopt a new mouse to their pack.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:58.750
Eight... Urgh. Nine...
Urgh... Ten!

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.120
Ah, Pretty dang
impressive jumping in

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:03.130
with three sets of
hundred-kilo reps.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.630
Alrighty. Keep that form
steady to the end.

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:07.340
Only one more to go!

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:11.050
Okay. Eleven!

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.170
Attaboy. You might
as well keep going.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.510
One more for kicks!

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.730
[grunting]

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.940
[FUJIO] Sweet. You did it!
Awesome work, buddy.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.190
Well, time to finish
out nice and strong!

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.480
What?!

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.020
You heard me, boy. C'mon,
you're almost there!

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.360
[SAKURAI groaning]

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.690
[FUJIO] Awesome. Last one
for real this time. Let's go!

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.660
Seriously? How many
last reps are we doing?

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.530
My arms are about to give out!

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.250
Nah-ah-ah. Don't let all
that effort go to waste.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.540
Go for the glory. Just one more.
Do it, stud!

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.170
Jeez, Fuji, lay off already.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:46.790
Just spot the kid
before he chokes!

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.470
The man's a certified sadist,

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.510
which is why I never
ask him to spot me.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.220
Let's go!

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:59.180
[SAKURAI grunting]

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.730
[FUJIO]
Sorry if I pushed you too hard.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:04.520
If I can be honest though,
you were getting

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.690
so fired up that I
got fired up, too.

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.900
And that fire's why all
our younger gym members

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.070
keep getting burned out.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.400
[KUROKI]
Shh!

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.410
No big. Actually, I haven't

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.620
pushed myself that hard
in quite a while.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:16.950
Really?

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.570
And having a great spotter

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.540
really does boost
your efficiency.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.660
Oh wow. We've finally
found somebody

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.550
who can keep up with Fuji.
You're a beast, kiddo!

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.340
Thing is, for some
reason we don't see

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.010
too many athletic
types around here.

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:31.340
So tell me, chief.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.010
Do you have any
particular fitness goals

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:34.880
you might be trying to
achieve at the moment?

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.220
Because if you do, ya know
you could totally hire me

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.140
as your trainer, so I could
spot you all the time

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.390
and even help you come up
with a solid workout plan!

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:43.010
Calm down before
you pull a muscle.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.350
Don't push the sales pitch too
much or you'll scare 'im!

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.230
I just enjoy working out.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.310
I'm not sure I have
any real goals.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.820
We're here because
our doctors told us

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.440
we needed to get more exercise.

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.830
Also, my daughter says I'm lame
and I need some toughening up.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.200
Oh, tell me about it.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.910
My son's been giving me
a piece of his mind, too.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.120
So how 'bout it, boys?

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.620
What do you say I
cook us up a routine

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.120
for clean gains in the name
of fatherly dignity?

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:07.090
You guys ready to
be baddie daddies?

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:09.210
[IMURA]
No thanks boss, I'm good.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.420
[KUROKI] Training with you would
be a straight-up death wish.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.000
Aw c'mon, pwease?

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.720
Anyway, what do you think about
joining up with us, Sakurai?

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.510
Staying fit is easier when
you've got some workout buddies.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.980
[SAKURAI]
That's definitely true.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.650
And invite your friends to
join us too, if you like.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.430
We'll all catch those
endorphins together.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.690
[FUJIO]
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.610
Y'know, that sounds
like a great idea.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:29.940
[FUJIO]
Hoo-rah!

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.520
[KUROKI]
Looking forward to it!

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.650
[SAKURAI] I doubt Uzaki would
come if I invited her, though.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.200
Ugh. Why would anyone
fork up hard-earned cash

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.240
to get tired and
sweaty in public?

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.280
[SAKURAI]
Is probably what she'd say.

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:41.660
Hmph.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.700
Whatever, it's okay for this
to just be a me thing.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.130
[FUJIO] Tell me Chief,
do you have any fitness goals?

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:49.000
[SAKURAI]
Fitness goals, huh?

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.370
Can't say I have any
specific ones in mind.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.050
I guess I'll just try out a
bunch of different exercises.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.760
[SAKURAI] Speaking of which,
gotta make sure

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.390
I try new things out
of the gym, too.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.510
[UZAKI]
Oh. It's Sakurai.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.600
[FUJIO]
Guess who?

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.810
Hey, Dad. Mom's in the kitchen.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.930
Hello! Hope you had
a nice commute.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.400
Dinner's almost ready, hon.
Go ahead and wash up.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.900
Okiedokie, hon. Worked up a
real sweat today, I'm starving!

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.150
[NARRATOR]
Look familiar?

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.120
[FUJIO] Exciting news today,
we just got a new gym member.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.120
A nice kid around
your age, Hana.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.450
Well good for you pops,
that's exciting.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.670
Because from what
you've told me,

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.290
you don't get too
many younger folks.

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:29.750
[FUJIO] Nope, we sure don't.
And if I'm being honest,

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.330
the place is way too
quiet without 'em.

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.630
We're pretty desperate for
new faces, so it'd be nice

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.170
if this kid brought some friends
with him or something.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.930
You could join, Hana.

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.180
Are you kidding?
What would I even do there.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.050
Hang out with the
mid-life crisis crew?

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:44.680
Yeah, no, I think I'll pass.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.640
[FUJIO]
Hey, those're my boys!

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:48.770
Wait. You might have a point.

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:50.810
I don't want to think about
what a bad influence those

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.530
over-the-hill slackers
might be on my baby girl.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:55.150
Stay away from them
at all costs!

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:56.900
Yeah, sure dad.

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:59.700
Oh, hey, Mom, I think our
chef-in-training's down

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.070
for another cooking lesson.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.830
When were they
looking to stop by?

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:04.700
Probably our usual
Thursday afternoon, if that

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:08.160
works for you. We're hoping
to learn how to simmer a fish.

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:09.710
[TSUKI]
That sounds wonderful, sweetie.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.290
I'll get the ingredients.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:14.500
[UZAKI] Yay, thanks Mom. I'll
make sure it's on the calendar.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:16.050
Cooking lessons, eh?

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:18.510
Is this the same friend who made
all that udon a while back?

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:19.720
That was them, all right.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.260
I suppose when you're
living on your own,

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.430
it can inspire you to
learn some cooking skills.

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:26.390
But I've never seen a new chef
taking food this seriously.

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:29.680
Really now? Such determination!
I can get behind that.

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:32.480
I bet this girl will make
a great wife one day.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.150
Actually, my friend's a dude.

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:37.320
And send text.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.910
[FUJIO]
Huh, my bad. I stand corrected.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:44.240
It's a shame I won't
get to meet this guy.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.820
Know what, I think
I'll just go ahead

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:47.540
and take the day off
so I can join you.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.500
What are you talking
about Fujio, you can't.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.000
Didn't we agree
you'd save your PTO?

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.960
[laughing]

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:57.380
[YANAGI]
Hey, everyone, I'm home!

00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:01.420
Brrr, I'm freezing.
When'd it get so cold?

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:10.850
Boy, am I starving.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:13.810
What are we having for
dinner tonight, Mom? Oh...

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.530
Hey there, sport, would you
be a dear and have a seat?

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:19.530
So, what's up. The usual?

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:21.450
Yeah, Dad's in a mood.

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:24.990
[UZAKI] Ugh. I knew I should
have kept my big mouth shut.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:26.280
[FUJIO]
Now that we're all here,

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:29.040
the Uzaki family meeting
shall commence.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.710
There's something
we must discuss.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.250
It's about Hana. I'm afraid
she has a boyfriend.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.790
No freakin' way, Dad.
Seriously? That's a joke, right!

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:43.680
Wow, really? Guess our big sis
found "the one." Good for you.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.220
It's not good at all!

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.010
Someone's finally come
to take away my baby girl.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.730
He's probably some
good-for-nothing bum

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:51.190
who sleeps through his classes.

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:53.190
He better be making nothing
less than straight A's,

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:54.480
or else I won't allow it!

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.230
We know this is gonna
go nowhere and end

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:58.600
with Dad stuck in
his fee-fees, right?

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:01.570
I'm hungry. Can we please
have dinner already, Ma?

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:03.570
Hana's technically an adult,
so wouldn't it make

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:05.780
more sense to let her do
whatever she wants now?

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.570
Not gonna lie, Daddy,
it's real wack for you

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.250
to try and decide
things for her.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.250
If you keep nagging your
children like this,

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.750
then they'll only end up
resenting you once they grow up.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:17.080
Why do you kids always
pick on your old man?

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:18.710
I can't believe it
was only yesterday

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:20.130
when you were still in diapers.

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:21.590
We used to watch
TV together while I

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.210
taught you your first words.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.840
Yeah, and then everyone
made fun of me

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.340
for sounding like a meathead.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:28.220
Thanks for drudging up
that memory.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.970
Imprinting can be traumatic!

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.900
Aw, it's cute that Dad
talks like a stupid jock.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:34.510
[FUJIO]
Yeah, yeah, laugh it up.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.350
You're free to make
fun of me all you like,

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.230
but at the end of the day,
you can't escape your roots!

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:41.560
I dare you to pretend
you don't remember!

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:43.400
[KIRI] Aren't those the lyrics
to that one jingle

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:45.660
from those old
electrical safety PSAs?

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.120
Whoa, I do remember.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.450
[laughs] What did I say.

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:51.700
Can't deny the time you
shared with your father!

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:53.500
[laughing]

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.710
[NARRATOR]
It was a strange inside joke.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.250
I guess you had to be there.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:59.670
[UZAKI] Actually, this is good.
Dad's gone so far off track

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.290
it's completely derailed
the conversation.

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.220
Phew, talk about
dodging a bullet.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.220
Anyway, tell us all about this

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.970
mystery boyfriend
of yours, Hana.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:09.220
[UZAKI]
Huh?!

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.430
[YANAGI] What's he like, huh?
Is he a bad boy?

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:12.640
Can you show me a picture?

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.680
I know you have one,
pretty please!

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.230
Sorry. I don't have
any pictures to share.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:18.810
[NARRATOR]
Liar!

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:21.740
[UZAKI] Uh. I've should've known
she'd have a million questions.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.860
I spoke way too soon.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.230
So, there's a guy into
short stacks like you, eh?

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.610
How do you know he's not
just a creep with a fetish.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.410
I'm starting to think
Dad has legit reasons

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:31.830
for worrying about you.

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:35.330
Huh? Who are you callin' a
short stack, ya pipsqueak?

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:36.790
Why don't you save
the big boy act

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.960
for when you can finally
reach the top shelf?

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.130
It's no wonder chicks don't
give you the time of day.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:44.210
Screw you! I'm already
160 centimeters.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.760
I'm not little, okay?
I'm just a tad below average!

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.840
Inside voices you two, please!

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:50.970
Now just remember,
no matter how tall,

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.970
you'll always be
my little slugger.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:55.590
Whatever! I still haven't
finished growing!

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.810
One of these days I'm gonna
shoot past you, too, Dad!

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.560
How tall is your mystery
boyfriend, Hana?

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:04.280
I dunno. I think he said he
was like 180 centimeters?

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:07.450
[YANAGI] He's gargantuan.
That's taller than all of us!

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:08.910
Well, I mean height
isn't everything.

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:10.450
So who cares, right, Dad?

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:11.950
That's exactly right, kiddo.

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:15.280
[YANAGI] Oof. Like tiny
father, like tiny son.

00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:18.710
[clears throat] Okay.
Let's get back on topic.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:22.130
This guy, is he nice or is he
just some deadbeat loser?

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.250
These are the sorts of things
your old man is worried about,

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:27.050
ya know. Does he have
a good personality?

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.880
Does he have good manners?

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:30.560
Does he take care of
his mental health?

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:33.930
And of course, how many
kilos can he bench press?

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:37.220
[NARRATOR]
Because Daddy needs to know.

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:39.230
I know it's a lot, but
if you can't answer me

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:40.560
then you can forget
about dating the g--

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.140
Listen, he's great
and super respectable.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.610
Whoa, Hana.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.070
He isn't a deadbeat.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.780
If anything, the guy could
stand to let loose a little.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.610
He looks over my
homework for me.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:52.950
He keeps himself out of trouble,

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:54.780
and he likes weightlifting
and playing video games.

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:57.040
Now that I think about it,
he's kind of a nerd.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.250
[YANAGI]
Go off, sis.

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:00.460
Keep giving us
those juicy deets!

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.960
His apartment's always
clean when I'm there!

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.630
His apartment.
Have you slept over?

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:06.500
[UZAKI screaming]

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:07.420
[gasps]

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.420
[FUJIO gasping]

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:12.300
Dang, look at you. Get it girl.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:15.130
Oh, shut up! There's
nothing's going on. Ugh!

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.390
I just go over to his place
to hang out, that's all!

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:19.470
We both like video games,
so we play together!

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.400
He can't cook to save his life,
so sometimes I make him food!

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.360
There's no hanky-panky
or weird stuff.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.150
It's nothing but good, clean
fun!

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.570
[TSUKI gasps] My, I'm so
surprised that the two of you

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.610
have such a pure relationship.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.490
And to think this
entire time, I...

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.990
Let's just say that Mommy
imagined something else.

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:39.200
Stop it, Mom. I'm gonna vom!
Anyway, you're all wrong.

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:41.170
Because I tried to
explain myself earlier,

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:43.590
but, well, the truth
is... that he's...

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.340
He's not really my boyfriend.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:48.760
Huh? If you guys aren't going
out, why do you sleep over?

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.260
You're saying you guys
game together

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.470
and that sometimes you even
cook him up a nice meal.

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:53.930
And you're still
not dating? Whoa...

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:55.090
Oh, Hana.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.520
[BOTH]
What are you even doing?

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:57.800
[UZAKI grunting]

00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:59.140
It's worse than I thought!

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:01.060
You're sweet on this guy,
aren't you?

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.810
[UZAKI]
No, you've got it all wrong!

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:05.180
He's always been a loner,
ever since high school.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:06.310
We're in college now,

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.690
and he still acts
like a total hermit!

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:10.810
He's so hopeless I
can't help but look out

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.650
for the poor schmuck, okay?

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.120
You're head over heels!

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.540
No, that's not it, Dad!

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:17.610
If anyone's catching feelings,
it's not me.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.700
He's the one who's got
the crush here, capisce?

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.570
Huh? That's basically
the same thing!

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.200
No. There's a major difference!

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:25.290
Oh c'mon, potato, patato!

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:26.910
[UZAKI]
Not all potatoes are the same!

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.630
You've already met Hana's guy
pal a few times, right, Mom?

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:31.960
Of course. He's dropped
by for cooking lessons

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:34.800
with your sister and I.
He's actually a nice boy.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.550
[TSUKI] He still kinda
scares me, though.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:38.800
You guys cook?
What have you made so far?

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:41.060
Do you happen to remember
those delicious croquettes

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:42.310
that we enjoyed the other day?

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:43.480
[YANAGI]
How could I forget.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.270
Wait, Hana's friend made those?

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:48.140
I was devouring them.
They were incredible!

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:49.360
[gasps]

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.360
What's the matter, Kiri?
Problem?

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.070
So, all those bowls of udon we
were eating for days and days

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:56.110
a few weeks back
was that stuff?

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.870
Yes, the cooking was all him.

00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:59.200
[gasps]

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:04.580
You gotta be kidding!

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.200
You're sayin' a
dude cooked that?

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:07.790
I was in noodle heaven thinking

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:09.790
a college girl made
those beauties.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.260
Way to ruin the
entire fantasy, Mom!

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:14.300
I'm gonna be sick! [sobs]

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.420
[TSUKI] I supposed Kiri's
reached that tender age

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:18.100
where everything
is a disappointment.

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.140
[YANAGI] If he had any
kind of mental filter,

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.060
girls might actually like him.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.560
Just forget it.
I'm going to bed.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.430
We're not finished.
Hey, come back!

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.020
I guess I made her mad.

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:30.390
Well, what do you expect, Dad?

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.230
You're always
taking things too far.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.610
Then I better leave it alone.

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:36.400
But now, I'm even more confused!

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:39.370
Is this punk implying my baby
girl's not good enough for him?

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:41.080
Why hasn't he tried to
put the moves on her

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.410
after everything
she's done for him?

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:44.950
Isn't that crazy?
Heck, he's driving me nuts,

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.750
but I'm impressed
at the same time!

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.540
Make up your mind, Daddy.

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:52.500
[KIRI] I was being scammed
the whole time! Give it back!

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:55.930
[TSUKI] Wait. Hana claims that
Sakurai isn't her boyfriend.

00:20:56.010 --> 00:21:00.260
She said he hasn't
made a move on her. So...

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:03.510
But soon. I wanna hold her.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.980
[TSUKI] So then,
what was that all about?

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.560
Could it be that the one
he's actually been after...

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.980
...was me this entire time?

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:12.810
[NARRATOR] In the end,
the family meeting ended up

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.070
confusing everyone
and helping no one.

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.650
Meanwhile, the person of
interest for the aforementioned

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.910
meeting remained
blissfully unaware.

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:23.330
...97. Urgh...

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:25.080
...98...

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.910
...99...

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.250
...100!

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:31.880
[SAKURAI] Yep, always feels
nice to break a sweat.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.880
Nothing better than
clearing out the old cobwebs.

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:42.010
Yeah, I've still got
another set in me.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:45.800
[NARRATOR] Testosterone
achievement unlocked.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.430
[UZAKI]
Why do I even bother?

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.060
Dad just doesn't get it.

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:57.740
Sakurai's the one who likes me.
Not the other way around, right?

00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:58.990
You're head over heels!

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:01.570
Except I'm not, you weirdo!

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.120
[YANAGI laughs]

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.410
[YANAGI] Looks like things are
starting to get interesting.
