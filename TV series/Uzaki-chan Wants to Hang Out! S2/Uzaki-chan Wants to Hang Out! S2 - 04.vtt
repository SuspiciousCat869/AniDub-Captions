WEBVTT

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.930
[UZAKI laughing]
Who'da thunk, eh?

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.020
I guess we really do
make a great pair.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.930
You might just be a
match made in heaven!

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.560
If nothing's stopping you,
why not go for it?

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.230
[laughing, sighs]

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.280
[UZAKI muffled screaming]

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.030
[YANAGI] Mom! Help!
I think Hana's drowning!

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.910
[TSUKI]
What? Stay with me, Hana!

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.290
Mommy's got you!

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.470
[UZAKI laughs]

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.010
What I'm saying is,

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.930
it would seem that
everybody's favorite loner

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.390
Sakurai is basically
obsessed with me.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.930
What can I say?

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.440
I've always known deep down
that I'm a certified temptress!

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.150
[BOTH]
Huh?!

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.520
Wow, that's interesting.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.650
So, did something happen
after the festival?

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.900
Heh, lemme tell ya!

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.990
I've had a sneaking suspicion
for a while now

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.990
that Mister Meathead's
caught some feelings.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.370
But then I had an ah-ha moment.
He's totally crushing!

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.370
[SAKAKI] Wait, she's only
realizing that now?

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.080
[ASAI]
And this late in the game?

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.460
No wonder she's looking
even more chipper than usual.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.290
[SAKAKI] The girl's practically
beaming with joy.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.250
[SAKAKI] Question, Uzaki, have
you looked in a mirror lately?

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.550
Huh? I wash my face and
brush my teeth every day.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.130
So yeah, obviously.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.970
[SAKAKI] What's obvious is that
you can't read sarcasm. Still...

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.220
Despite Uzaki's obliviousness,

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.690
things are finally starting
to develop here, and yet...

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.060
[ASAI] I can't believe those
two hopeless dum-dums

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.070
made it this far, and yet...

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.900
[CAFÉ OWNER] And yet,
even though the ball is in

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.700
their court, and the goal
is right in front of them.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.750
[SAKAKI, ASAI, CAFÉ OWNER]
It doesn't make a difference.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.910
Those fools are
never gonna score.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.420
Hey, what should we do
to speed things along?

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.790
[CAFÉ OWNER]
At this point it's all up

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.540
to those two, wouldn't you say?

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.510
There isn't much we can
do from the sidelines.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.340
[SAKAKI]
Never say never, my good man.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.840
It isn't too late to add a
little fuel to the love engine.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.180
[ASAI whimpering]

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.970
[SAKAKI]
Oof, she's a mess.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.690
All these pit stops must be
making her brain spin out.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.480
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Yes, it would seem that way.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.980
I know it must be
torture for her,

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.610
but we can't afford
to blow our cover yet.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.360
[SAKAKI]
We've got to lend a hand...

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.490
[CAFÉ OWNER] ...while also being
careful not to show our hand.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.410
[SAKAKI] Say, where's Saku?
Is he not working today?

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.160
[CAFÉ OWNER] Hmm?
Oh, Sakurai has the day off.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.870
He's such a goof.
He bought another new video game

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.080
and then rushed home
to play it like a nerd.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.210
And he's already got a whole
backlog of titles piled up.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.250
He can be a real hoarder.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.590
That's impressive.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.550
[SAKAKI]
She gobbled that bait up

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.590
Why not go keep him company?

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.970
[UZAKI]
I figure he wants to enjoy

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.720
the first playthrough
by himself.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.850
And I'm not trying to get in
between him and his fun.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.560
[SAKAKI] Huh. That's
surprisingly thoughtful of her.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.690
Especially since she usually
barges in uninvited.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.270
[UZAKI laughs]
And besides, he likes me, right?

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.690
Probably in a less-than-
wholesome type of way.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:38.780
[ASAI gasping]

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.360
[SAKAKI]
She actually said that out loud?

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.070
Going there alone would be like
walking into a lion's den.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.000
Some very frisky lions,
if you know what I'm saying.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.960
[SAKAKI] Huh?! Of course,
she isn't being considerate.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.130
At the end of the day,
she's just being a chicken!

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.710
Ugh, why do I bother?

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.170
[SAKAKI] Okay, but why
would any of that matter now?

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.590
[UZAKI]
Hm?

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.590
[SAKAKI] You've been to Saku's
place plenty of times.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.180
On occasion, you've even
spent the night there.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.760
[UZAKI gasps]

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.100
[SAKAKI] And when I first met
you, didn't you say that Sakurai

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.350
was the safest creature
in the whole world?

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.520
I did, but now I'm not so sure.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.900
They say you can
never be too careful.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.230
What if that fortune
somehow awakened

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.820
something beastly inside him?

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.820
That's a crock of--

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.700
[NARRATOR]
And just like that, Ami snapped!

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.280
I dunno, Uzaki.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.870
It would take a lot to change
a stubborn bull like him.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.910
[UZAKI] How can you be
so certain about that?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.290
This is a full-grown man
we're talking about.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.750
Better safe than sorry.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.250
[SAKAKI] Since when have you
ever followed that advice?

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.460
[ASAI growls]

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.760
Blowing up isn't going
to accomplish anything.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.510
Listen, I'm sorry, but with
everything that's happening

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.140
so far, all this waiting
around's getting on my nerves.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.850
[CAFÉ OWNER grunting]

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.100
[SAKAKI]
I get why Asai's frustrated.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.480
At first it was kinda cute,
but this tension's

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.190
becoming more and more
awkward by the day.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.900
I'd hoped Uzaki would've
gone for it by now.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.030
Didn't think she'd be the type

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.820
to choke when push
came to shove.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.700
And if nothing changes, the way
those two are bumbling around,

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.080
they're gonna end up
stuck in an awkward

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.500
holding pattern for
the rest of their lives!

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.040
[ASAI]
It's no use!

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.620
I can't just sit back and
watch them anymore.

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.380
Believe me, I'm dying to see
how this goes down. But...

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.800
[BOTH] At this rate, those
monkeys are never gonna breed.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.970
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Interesting choice of metaphor.

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.970
[phone ringing]

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.220
[UZAKI]
Hm? Hey there, gamer boy?

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.440
[SAKURAI] Eh, I'm getting kinda
bored just playing with myself.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.770
But you bought yourself
a copy, too, didn't you?

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.270
Wanna co-op with me?

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.150
[UZAKI]
Jeez, inconsiderate much?

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.490
I've got a lot on the ol'
agenda today, y'know!

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:43.690
[SAKURAI]
Oh, my bad. Another time then.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.030
[UZAKI]
Fine, twist my arm why don't ya.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.120
Okay, I guess I'll help
you out even though

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.580
you're not leaving me
much of a choice.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.370
Well, I tried to say no,
but you know how he can be.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.170
Can't leave him alone for a
second before he starts cryin'!

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.000
[GROUP grunts]

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.880
Okey-dokey, see ya later,
coffee makers!

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.470
[SAKAKI, ASAI]
What is this, a booty call?

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.060
What's your take on the matter?

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.260
I feel like I'm going nuts.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.810
Those dodos need to
get it on already!

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.230
[SAKAKI]
Yeah, I hear you.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.730
Don't worry, I'll come up
with a new plan of attack.

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.940
It's time to quit playing games
and kick things into high gear.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.820
Right there with ya, buddy.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.780
[NARRATOR] And thus, a different
sort of co-op mission began.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.570
Is this really a good idea?

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.280
[SAKAKI] There's something
crucial here that Uzaki

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:32.700
hasn't even thought about.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.830
It's important that we
let her know at once.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.420
Alternatively, maybe we
could just lock them

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.830
in a cell for a few days,

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.380
or leave them on a deserted
island instead?

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.670
Wait, it's almost winter,
so we could try the mountains.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.930
We need to isolate them
under extreme conditions.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:51.600
Um. Why not something
a bit less insane.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.230
[door opens]

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.690
Hello, be with you
in a sec-- Uh?

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.020
Yo, how ya doin'?

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.070
Look who it is. Someone's
been stopping by a lot.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.070
Oh, Sakurai's not here.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.240
[SAKAKI]
Aw, guess I missed him.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.570
[SAKAKI]
Just as planned.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.200
[ASAI]
By our immaculate design.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.870
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Aw yeah.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.580
[NARRATOR] They had
strategically rearranged

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.830
that week's schedule
so Sakurai and Uzaki

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.200
worked separate shifts.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:21.250
Providing the most ideal
environment for subjugation.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.630
[UZAKI] So, I was like, "Hey,
don't you have something to say

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.920
to me?", then he froze and made
that face he's always making!

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.380
[SAKAKI] She's been chattering
away this entire time.

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:31.390
Still as giddy as ever.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:34.010
A whole week's gone by
since the school festival,

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.930
and yet she hasn't made
a move on the poor guy.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.310
[ASAI] It's like she's strutting
around with boxing gloves,

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:42.020
but she won't get in
the stupid ring, argh.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.230
No, wait, I gotta stay calm.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.820
Today's the day we make Uzaki
get in there and throw down!

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.820
Then again, how are we
supposed to do that

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.200
when she's got her
head in the clouds?

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.490
[SAKAKI] Listen, don't
take this the wrong way,

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.290
but for all the
celebrating you're doing,

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.370
don't you think you're
getting ahead of yourself?

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.460
[CAFÉ OWNER grunts]

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.710
What do you mean?

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:02.710
[SAKAKI]
You've been gloating about

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:04.750
how Sakurai's been
crushing on you.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.300
But how do you know you aren't
just projecting onto him?

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.420
[ASAI]
Did this jerkface really just--?

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:12.800
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Whoa, right for the jugular.

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:16.720
[UZAKI] I mean, I don't think
I'm imagining things. I hope.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.180
[SAKAKI] Have you asked
the big guy how he feels?

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:21.390
If you haven't,
you probably should.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.110
[UZAKI] But-- But I was
pretty sure about it.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:26.360
You might not be aware of
what I'm about to tell you,

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.110
but Saku's super popular
with his classmates.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.780
He's what now?

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.360
He's a good kid, after all.

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:36.280
Our customers are fans of his as
well, especially female patrons.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:38.040
And some of the guys
like him, too.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.000
Since when?

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.660
Sakurai's a funny one.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.710
He does give off
scary vibes at first,

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:44.920
and you wouldn't
necessarily think

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.840
he's the easiest guy to talk to.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.840
But later, when you
get to know him,

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.880
he's surprisingly kind
and down to earth. Hot!

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:53.340
Not to blow anyone's cover,

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.760
but sometimes you can
catch the girls staring.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.550
And who am I to blame them?

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.520
That boy is such
diligent worker.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.680
There isn't a more
upstanding young man!

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.350
Now if I were only
a little younger,

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.980
I'd be going after him myself!
I'd wear him right out!

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:10.440
[UZAKI gasping]
Wh-What is this?

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:13.200
Why is my back getting
sweaty all of a sudden?

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.570
[SAKAKI] Of course, with the way
you always hang around him,

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.080
people assume he's taken.
You just don't notice.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.790
[SAKAKI] It's true!
Saku may not be perfect,

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.160
but despite his flaws,
he's a solid fixer-upper!

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.170
[UZAKI] Are we talking
about the same guy?

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.090
[BOTH]
Mm-hm!

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.960
[NARRATOR] The other two nodded
with their noddiest nods yet.

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:32.880
So, all things considered,
you should be careful

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.300
not to let your guard down.

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:35.510
He's like a bag of fries

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:38.260
being circled by a flock
of hungry seagulls.

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.470
So be wary, otherwise
some other girl

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.180
might swoop in
before you know it.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.520
[UZAKI growls]

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.730
Even your friend here
can't stop looking at Saku

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:47.400
with goo-goo eyes.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:50.320
[ASAI screaming]

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.990
Hold up, you've been
checking him out, too?

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.280
[ASAI] Don't listen to him!
It's nothing but slander!

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.030
Huh? You're always practically
drooling over the guy.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.370
Since when do you
even try to hide it?

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.910
I'm hardly ever here, and
your tongue's always dragging.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.710
[ASAI]
What are you even talking about?

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:08.540
[SAKAKI] Look, I get it.
He's got that hot swimmer bod.

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:10.250
[UZAKI]
I knew it! You do check him out!

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.670
[ASAI] Not like that!
I only look respectfully!

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.840
That's not the word I'd use.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.220
Thanks, Dad!

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.300
Well, you do try to tone
it down around customers.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:19.550
[ASAI]
Like that's better?

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.060
Listen, I don't lech out
on him or anybody else!

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.980
[UZAKI]
Sakaki, if you wouldn't mind?

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:29.360
[ASAI gasping]

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.360
[SAKAKI] Uh-huh.
Nothing pervy about that.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.780
[UZAKI]
You thirsty little minx.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.490
Wait, that's not
who I am at all!

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.070
It's 'cause I can't
help myself sometimes.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:38.320
My eyes just go where they go,
and I get sucked in!

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:39.780
[SAKAKI]
Bet that'd hold up in court.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:43.080
Listen, it's not like I
like Sakurai or anything.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.660
Well, I don't exactly
hate him, either,

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.080
if that makes sense?

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.120
I mean I never thought of
him as boyfriend material.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:51.000
Er, that's harsh. I'm saying
he has a nice personality!

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:53.250
No, not that it. Ooh, I know!

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:56.260
The only thing that
I want is his body!

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:00.720
That totally came out wrong!

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.520
I rest my case.
Sex-crazed predators like Asai

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.140
only want one thing
and it's disgusting.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:09.730
It's not my fault he's hot.

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:10.650
[SAKAKI]
There's nothing wrong with

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.070
getting caught up in the moment.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.190
But if you think you want
to be with Saku like that,

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:17.360
you might wanna make a move
sooner rather than later.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:22.330
Well, you do have a point.
But even so, I...

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:23.490
[SAKURAI]
Hey, everybody. How y'all doing?

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.620
[gasps]

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.040
[CAFÉ OWNER]
My, speak of the devil.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.420
Yo, I thought you were
supposed to be off today.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.710
Uzaki and I were planning
to have dinner at my place

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.960
after she finished her shift,
but since it's been

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.090
getting dark earlier
and earlier these days,

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:39.590
I thought I'd pick her up
and walk her over.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.470
Well, aren't you a gentleman.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:42.600
[SAKURAI]
Hm?

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.100
One sec. I gotta change!

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.680
Sure. Wanna join us, Itsuhito?

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:49.100
Oh man, I wish I could.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.810
The agenda's looking really
packed at the moment.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.730
Alrighty then. Say,
are you okay Ami?

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:58.150
You've been, uh, staring at
the dishes this entire time.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.530
[ASAI]
Oh, don't mind me.

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:02.030
Let's just say I've run
out of spoons for the day.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.990
It's taking every last ounce
of strength I have

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.620
to focus on these mugs.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.370
Huh?

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.790
[SAKAKI] Fire successfully
kindled, and now we wait.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.840
I'm glad we got things
moving again.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.170
I mean we did have to drag you
through the mud to do it,

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:17.630
but a victory's still a victory!

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:18.920
[laughing]

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.380
[ASAI whines]
I hate your guts, you know that?

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:22.510
You gonna cry about it?

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:24.760
[ASAI cries]

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:25.970
[CAFÉ OWNER sighs]

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.310
Hey. You've barely said
a word to me tonight.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.520
You good?

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:37.070
[UZAKI] Uh, I'm fine.
Just had a long day.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.740
Now, what should we
make for dinner tonight?

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.570
I'm so hungry I could
eat a whole horse!

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:58.250
[SAKURAI] All right. I mustn't
waste a single breadcrumb.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:59.840
You know, Sakurai.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.170
You actually don't have to be
precise with your measurements.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:03.930
For real, you're taking forever!

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.600
Rough estimates are fine
for recipes like this!

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.100
Are they? I wouldn't know.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.140
I've never made
fried food before.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:12.770
I guess I'm worried I'm gonna
screw up these croquettes.

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:15.480
[TSUKI] I understand,
but it can be exhausting

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.770
to weigh out every
single ingredient.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.610
[SAKURAI]
Then what should I do instead?

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:21.740
[TSUKI]
That's a good question.

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.240
I suppose it's time I showed you

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.660
how to eyeball
your measurements.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:27.240
[SAKURAI] Seriously?
But I'm only a beginner.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.990
Am I even ready?
Isn't that an advanced skill?

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.120
[TSUKI] No, it's not
particularly complicated.

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:36.040
As the name suggests,
you use your eyes

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:38.460
to estimate the amount
of something.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:42.470
Let's start by taking a look
at the ten grams of salt

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:45.010
you measured earlier.
You ready?

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.140
I think so.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.640
Now do your best to pour
out the same amount.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.430
[SAKURAI]
Uh, okay.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.230
[SAKURAI exhales]

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:57.560
Perfect first try!

00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:58.770
You're not just saying that?

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.110
Of course not!

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:02.860
The whole point is it doesn't
have to be exact.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.070
[SAKURAI]
Hm...

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.950
That young man takes
everything seriously, huh?

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:11.370
Sure does, but that's
classic Sakurai for ya.

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:13.870
[UZAKI laughs]

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.410
Hurry up, or else
some other girl

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.130
might swoop in
before you know it.

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:18.880
[SAKAKI screaming]

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.380
[TSUKI]
Hana?

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.210
What now? Oh, don't mind me,
just gotta cramp in my arm.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.550
[laughs]

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:30.720
[TSUKI sighs] I should take
a little breather, too.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.100
[gasps]

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.560
Why, thank you sweetie.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.850
Sakurai's really
enthusiastic about cooking,

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.560
so he might keep coming over
to polish his skills.

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:41.270
That okay with you, Mom?

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.030
As long as he's happy to learn,
it's absolutely fine.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.490
And all the practice he puts in

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.610
does help me get
dinner on the table.

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.780
[UZAKI] Well, I'm glad to hear
you're okay with it.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:52.280
You know what's funny though?

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:55.250
The truth is, he does have
another reason for coming here.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.000
[TSUKI gasping]

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:01.500
[UZAKI] I was curious, what
do you think about Sakurai?

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:02.750
Be honest.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.470
[TSUKI gasps]
Where is she going with this?

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:07.800
Is this it?
Is it finally happening?

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.340
[NARRATOR]
It was not.

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:11.470
[TSUKI]
That's sudden? Why do you ask?

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:12.890
Oh, no reason.

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:15.640
Uh, it's just that I've heard
rumors about Sakurai,

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:18.730
like that he's pretty popular
with the girls at school.

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:19.940
Huh?

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.360
So, I thought I'd
get your opinion.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.190
That is, if you don't mind.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:27.740
[TSUKI]
My opinion... on what, exactly?

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:33.030
Uh. I better go feed
the cats now. C'mon guys!

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.740
Hana?

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.960
[SAKAKI] You might not be aware
of what I'm about to tell you,

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.920
but Saku's super popular
with his classmates.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.300
Stupid Sakaki.
Sakurai isn't a playboy!

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:50.050
Still though, what if
Sakaki's onto something?

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:55.720
[sighs]

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:57.140
[SAKURAI]
Here you go.

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:59.310
Fancy running into you here.

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:00.640
Are you all right?

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.310
You ran off, so I was
worried that you might've

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.110
gone too hard on
the drinks tonight.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.030
[CLASSMATE D]
Oh, what a gentleman.

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:07.650
Thanks for rescuing me.

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:11.110
Well, we're classmates.
Gotta look out for each other.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.700
Yes, of course. Well...

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.950
Uh! Ooopsie!

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.960
Hey. It's okay, I've got you.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.380
[CLASSMATE D sniffles]

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:23.750
[gasps]

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:30.840
It's no use. I can't lie.
I love you, Sakurai.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.180
I do, too!

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:35.140
[CLASSMATES]
Don't forget about us!

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.470
Me, too!

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.680
[CLASSMATES screaming]

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:40.020
[CLASSMATE H]
I need you so bad, bro!

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.390
[SAKURAI sputtering]

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.310
As if that would ever happen!

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:48.360
No more spiraling.
I'm the one that idiot likes!

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:52.650
[TSUKI]
I'm so confused.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.580
What was it that Hana was
trying to bring up earlier?

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.410
And why do I feel
anxious about it?

00:17:57.490 --> 00:17:58.240
So, um...

00:17:58.330 --> 00:17:59.660
[TSUKI screaming]

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:01.000
Ah, sorry about that.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.660
Didn't mean to
startle you just now.

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:05.340
Please, it's all right.
I startle easily.

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:07.090
Did you need something?

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.460
[SAKURAI] Uh. Just that I'm done
shaping the croquettes,

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:10.340
like you asked.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.590
Oh, how wonderful.

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:13.470
They're ready to be
breaded and fried.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:15.430
Uh. Okay.

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:21.480
[SAKURAI] Aw man, I almost
gave her a heart attack.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.270
I should have called to her
from the kitchen instead.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:27.320
Wait a second, what I would
I have even called her?

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:32.610
Like, Ma'am? Mrs. U?
Or Mama Uzaki?

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:34.570
[SAKURAI]
Question for ya.

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.700
Hm? Is something wrong?

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.120
[SAKURAI]
If you don't mind,

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.240
could you tell me your
first name, please?

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:41.370
[TSUKI gasps]

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.540
[yelps]

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:46.790
[TSUKI] Sharing something
like that can close the gap

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.460
between acquaintanceship
and intimacy!

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:52.510
Oh dear, this is
just like my dramas!

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:58.970
I have a favor to ask of you.
Please, my love.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.850
Allow me to call you
by your first name

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:02.100
from this moment forward.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.350
[gasps] Should I though?

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.150
[TSUKI] No, you musn't let him
tempt you so easily!

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:08.650
You have a family to look after.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:11.320
You can't just give your heart
away to this manchild!

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.820
[YOUTH A]
It doesn't matter.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:13.990
What?

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.410
Your silence at my
proposal says it all.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:19.330
That I already hold a prominent
space in your mind.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.040
[gasps]

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:24.790
Is that how that works?

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:31.050
Right. My name, it's...
it's Tsuki. Yes.

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.510
[TSUKI] No big deal.
I'm just telling him my name.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.470
I didn't even hesitate, which
means we're still in the clear.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:38.300
[NARRATOR]
She was playing a bizarre game

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:39.680
of mental chicken.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.100
Then in that case,
can I call you Ms. Tsuki?

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:45.600
Huh? Of course. Go right ahead.
Say my name however you like.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.730
As long as you
say it respectfully!

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:49.730
[SAKURAI]
Is she okay?

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.610
You'll know they're ready
to plate as soon as

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:55.650
the outsides turn
nice and brown.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.610
Oh. I better take them out.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:01.330
Ooh, smells great. Are you
almost finished cooking them?

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:04.410
Don't distract me, Uzaki.
I cannot let my guard down.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.910
If we're not careful,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.370
these things will explode
and blow up the entire house!

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.580
[UZAKI] Can you please relax?
You're way too scared

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:11.460
of deep-frying,
even for a beginner.

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:15.510
It's not that serious.
Don't get an ulcer!

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.510
[TSUKI]
I can't get a read on those two.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:18.840
Maybe I'll never understand

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.300
what those gremlins are
thinking, but still...

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:23.310
It's my responsibility
to speak up.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:26.020
Both as a mother,
and as an adult.

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.390
Hey, Hana. Can we talk?

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.940
Listen, sweetie, when we
were chatting and you asked

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.780
how I felt about Sakurai,
I got the impression

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.570
that you were feeling kind of
uncertain about him yourself.

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:38.950
Am I right?

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.280
Don't worry, I won't
ask about it now.

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.870
I just wanted to give you
a word of advice.

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:46.330
If there's one thing to
keep in mind about boys,

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:48.960
it's that you should find
one that'll be faithful.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.420
Thanks for the pep talk?

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:52.920
[SAKURAI]
I'm done!

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:58.260
Great work. You did
an expert job frying!

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.720
Wow, you really think so?

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.510
[gasps] Well, whaddaya say?
Wanna try out some croquettes?

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.310
Uh! I guess I don't
have a choice.

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:10.480
Someone's gotta make sure
they aren't poisonous.

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:14.520
[UZAKI]
Ooh!

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:17.230
What's the verdict? Be honest!

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.570
Seeing as you learned
to make 'em from my mom,

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:22.910
they're delicious!

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.740
Really?!

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:26.120
[UZAKI]
The boy can cook.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.750
Y'know, Sakurai seems like
a pretty faithful guy.

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.880
I almost forget what I
was so worried about.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.630
[ASAI laughing]

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:37.590
[CLASSMATES laughing]

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:41.050
Hurry up and get it in, girl!
Seize the day!

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:43.720
[UZAKI] Ugh... Right,
there's still everyone else.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.680
[SAKURAI] I couldn't have done
it without you, Ms. Tsuki!

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.180
Huh?

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:50.810
That's another great dish I can
finally add to my recipes.

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:52.640
Thanks for being
patient with me.

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:55.110
Oh please, give
yourself some credit.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:58.780
You learned so quickly.
You're a model student, my dear!

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:02.150
Ah, really? I'm looking forward
to my next lesson even more.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.910
Thanks, Ms. Tsuki!

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:08.580
[UZAKI]
Oh no. No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.040
This is gonna be a problem.
