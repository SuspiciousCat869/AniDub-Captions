WEBVTT

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.380
[BOY A]
C'mon, we're over here!

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.220
[GIRL A]
Right, try to hold it steady.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.140
[BOY B]
For real?

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.390
[GIRL B]
We don't have any more?

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.930
[BOY C]
That's epic!

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.310
It's festival time, boy!

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.860
I know your lonely ass
has no one to go with,

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.820
but never fear, Hana's here!
You excited or what?

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.860
Uh, I wasn't planning on going.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.740
Huh?!

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.910
[UZAKI]
You're not going? Why not?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.290
Festivals are like the
best part of college.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.750
Is this an introvert thing?

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.000
Who the heck are you
calling an introvert?

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.460
Look, I have my reasons
for holding off. Just relax.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.220
Don't you give me that crap.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.550
You're going to stay home
and play video games.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.550
Hey, that's not a bad idea.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.020
They released way too many
great titles last month.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.560
I don't like to be too judgy,
but you take being

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.980
a shut-in to a new
level sometimes.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.400
[SAKURAI]
Huh?

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.650
Okay, somebody needs to
branch out because every game

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.530
you have on here's an
absolute time-sinker.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.910
Which is why I'm holing up
for the three days off

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.530
we're getting for the festival.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.490
I figured it would be
a golden opportunity

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.870
to make some progress.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.080
And you don't think that
kinda loner behavior

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.580
makes you an introvert?

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.170
Listen, I like a good food
stall, but I don't have much

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.840
of a reason to go, so for me

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.170
it would really be the
ultimate time sinker.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.710
[UZAKI]
Huh?

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.680
Well, none of my friends are
setting up any booths this year,

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.430
and I've never really been
into the musical performances.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.470
Same for the comedy routines.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.100
It's a better investment
to stay in my room

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.270
and get my grind on in peace.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.480
You do realize that
you're calculating gains

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.600
and losses for something

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.520
that really isn't
that serious, right?

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.440
Damn straight.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.610
[UZAKI]
This is hopeless.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.360
As soon as he puts
his mind to something,

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.950
you can't change it.
Where are his priorities?

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.200
Choosing "experience points"
over "IRL experiences"?

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.620
That's not what
college is about!

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.210
Ugh, talk about a lost cause!

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.460
[sighs] Whatever. If he's taking
it easy, maybe I should, too.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.680
I know. How 'bout I come over
and hang while we're off, then?

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.590
Maybe I could whip
us up a little feast.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.720
That sounds nice!

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.220
[UZAKI laughs]

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.060
[SAKAKI]
Like two peas in a pod.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.100
[SAKAKI] He-yo. Uh,
mind if I join you guys?

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.480
[SAKURAI]
What's up? You look exhausted.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.610
Come and sit with us!

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.030
So, you guys got any
plans for the festival?

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.410
Nah, we're not gonna go.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.910
May as well take
advantage of the break.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.700
[SAKAKI]
Of course, figured as much.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.120
I see. Actually, I happen
to be helping with

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.120
the organizing
committee this year.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.380
That's surprising.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.090
No kidding.
It must be hard work.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.960
Yeah, and it's turning out
to be harder than I thought.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.090
At this point, it feels
like my entire life.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.510
That's what happens when
you're a people pleaser.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.180
You just can't say no, huh?

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.680
What can I say, you nailed it.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.890
Which is why I have to get
the two of you involved.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.140
[SAKURAI]
Huh?

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.560
[SAKAKI] Oh, I was just
remembering something

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.230
a committee member asked.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.900
They were wondering what we
should do to increase

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.740
festival attendance,
so I tossed them a pitch.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.530
Which they decided to go with,

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.570
but now I'm stuck
making it happen

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.570
'cause I'm the one
who suggested it.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.450
So, what's your
master plan, then?

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.370
[SAKAKI]
Glad you asked.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.120
[UZAKI]
Huh...?

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.790
A stamp rally?

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.040
Yep. For every 500 yen
you spend out there,

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.550
you get a stamp.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.880
And for each stamp you get,
you'll be entered into

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.470
the raffle we're holding on
the second day of the festival.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.510
If you win, you get
a fabulous prize.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.390
Isn't that basically gambling?

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.310
Do you guys even have the
budget for anything nice?

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.560
[SAKAKI] What? You guys
think we can only afford

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.730
to give out chump
change rewards here?

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.730
Hmph. Then allow me to clue
you in on the awesome loot

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.030
we'll be announcing tomorrow.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.950
[UZAKI]
Let's have a look. [gasps]

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.700
A DC6-Pro? This thing's
the console of my dreams!

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.580
You've got some super
premium swag on here.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.710
[SAKAKI] Sure, but it's a total
mess behind the scenes.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.210
I wound up supervising
the whole entire campaign.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.880
Remind me to keep my
mouth shut from now on.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.340
[SAKURAI]
Hm?

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.060
[SAKURAI]
So, you wanna go?

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.480
[UZAKI] Huh? Where'd that
question come from?

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.060
[SAKURAI] Let's be real,
you want that prize.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.610
No telling if we win,
but we'll better our chances

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.980
if we go in on this together.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.190
You sure, though?

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.440
I thought you were
trying to be a hermit.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.320
[SAKURAI]
Nah, it's cool.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.200
Now I've got a legit
reason to show up.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.290
I hope you're ready to
load up on these bad boys.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.830
This is gonna be the sickest
school festival ever! Let's go!

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.710
Oh great, I'm happy to hear you
two changed your minds.

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.460
A little word of advice, though.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.920
Naturally, the most expensive
booths are where you're gonna

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.130
do the most efficient
stamp-gathering.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.470
I recommend honing in
on the occult club.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.890
Not only are their
prices pretty high,

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.850
word on the street is
that their fortunes

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.270
end up being scarily accurate.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.270
Well, I'm gonna be on my way.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.440
[SAKURAI]
Right. Catch you later.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.860
You lovebirds have fun on your
little console quest, okay? Bye!

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.790
[BOTH]
That's not what this is, weirdo!

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.840
They ended up having
one hell of a turnout.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.760
Hey now, quit making that face.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.420
People are gonna think
you're a gangster

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:05.970
hunting down protection money.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.300
What? Why would a gangster
be doing that here?

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.890
And where'd you even learn
about that stuff anyway?

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.810
[UZAKI] From that one game of
yours. <i>Mafia: As a Tiger.</i>

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.480
[SAKURAI]
Oh. Yeah, that checks out.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.810
Cough up the damn
dough, asshole!

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.690
Right, why don't we
grab those stamps

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.490
and head back home
soon as we're done?

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.540
[SAKURAI]
Woah, a rock wall!

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.500
[grunts]

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.210
[laughs]

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.840
Go Sakurai!

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.550
You killed it back there!

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.930
[SAKURAI]
Yep, you know it.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.930
[SAKURAI] This must be what
Itsuhito was talking about.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:54.810
[UZAKI]
Looks like it's really popular.

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.890
I'm actually feeling
sort of exhausted from

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.560
all the running around
we've been doing.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.980
So, what do you say
we hop in line

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.440
and stop walking
for a little bit?

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.110
I'm down to join
the crowd if you are.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.030
Is there any particular type of
fortune you want 'em to read?

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.530
Nothing that I can
think of, you?

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.320
Nope, nothing for me either.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:13.540
Oh, I know!

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.080
We can ask 'em to divine
some tips and tricks

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.830
to help you speed run through
your new games a bit faster.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.540
You can find all that
stuff online, y'know.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.920
Well then you think
of something, genius.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.670
Like something useful?
They could divine me

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.470
the location of a
pet-friendly apartment

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.930
that's near a train stop
and a convenience store.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.220
You can find all of
that stuff online, too!

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.300
[GIRLS]
Awww!

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:35.890
--That's adorable!
--They're so cute.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:37.230
[SAKURAI]
Hm?

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:38.310
Heh. Good luck.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.190
Right?

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:42.810
Is it just me, or have people
been staring at us

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:43.940
like we're in a dang zoo?

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.230
It isn't just you.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.240
[SAKURAI]
And this line...

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.240
[ITO]
Next customer please!

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.120
[SAKURAI]
Coming!

00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:59.960
[UZAKI gasps]

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:04.710
Whoa! You can tell they aren't
kidding around in here.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.550
[UZAKI]
It's giving off authentic vibes.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.300
[ITO]
Oh. Hey, Hana!

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.880
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.510
[UZAKI] I-Ito?
You're in the occult club?

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.850
They actually had me
telling fortunes last year

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:19.140
and somehow I got a
ton of rave reviews.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.060
So, they decided to
have me come back.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:28.190
Anyway... Wait a second,
you guys came together?

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.780
So that's how it is, eh...

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:31.740
[UZAKI]
Huh?

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.240
I'm sorry.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.080
Things can get kinda complicated
when friends are involved.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.290
Don't mind me.
Go on, have a seat.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.630
Whatcha gonna ask her about,
Sakurai, real estate?

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:46.090
[ITO]
Real estate?

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.800
Yeah, whatever. I guess I'll
be job-hunting next year,

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.630
so I could use a
forecast on that?

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:55.010
Huh? You know we don't give
those types of readings, right?

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.470
What are you talking about?

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.180
[ITO] Our club specializes
in matters of romance.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.730
[BOTH gasp]
Are you for real?

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.270
Now I get it. Crap.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.230
So that's why the line
was full of women.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.650
This is awkward, but
we're gonna have to pass.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.990
Should we go hit up
a different booth?

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:15.030
Yeah.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.370
Wha... why?

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:17.780
[UZAKI]
Sorry, Ito.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.830
[SAKURAI] Our bad.
We'll get out of your hair.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.370
Wait a second, don't leave!

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.670
[BLACK HOOD A]
Where do you think you're going?

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.960
Where did these guys come from?

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.340
[BLACK HOOD A]
We don't appreciate cowards

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.380
who try to jump ship
at the last minute.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.760
[BLACK HOOD B] You cannot deny
the call of the cards.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.090
Leaving is forbidden.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.050
We didn't realize
what kind of operation

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.300
you were running
when we came in,

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:38.720
so you'll have to forgive us.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.310
Could we possibly pay you
a little extra cash

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:44.180
to skip the hocus pocus and
give us a stamp anyway?

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:47.060
[BLACK HOOD A laughs]
Ah, the impudence.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.270
No friggin' way!

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.610
[BLACK HOOD B]
Ignorant children like you

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:51.480
are the worst kind of customer!

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:52.940
[BLACK HOOD C]
Your bodies may be grown,

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:54.570
but your minds are immature!

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:56.280
[BLACK HOOD A] And to think
you strung along our most

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.120
promising newcomer as well.
How dare you!

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.910
[BLACK HOOD B]
Once you step into our domain,

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.000
you will submit
to the divination!

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.000
You nutjobs are taking
this way too far!

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.370
[BLACK HOOD C]
You hold your tongue.

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.960
People are waiting,
so hurry up and sit back down!

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.630
[BLACK HOOD A]
Proceed, Sister Ito.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:12.050
Go ahead and give it to them!

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.550
Wait sisters, I still
need time to prepare.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.510
I haven't even asked Sakurai
when his birthday is.

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:19.050
Sorry about this, you guys.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.560
These are the club rules
and as you can see,

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.980
the senior members
don't mess around.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:28.940
Listen, we might as well do as
they say and get this over with.

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.770
We'll only be wasting time
if we try to resist.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.780
Not to mention we're
totally holding up the line.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.780
[sighs]

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:41.030
[ITO grunts]
Right, where was I...

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.370
[BLACK HOOD A moans]

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:45.960
[UZAKI]
Did she just moan?

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.670
[SAKURAI] What happened to the
mysterious hooded figure act?

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.960
I've finished placing the cards.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.630
[UZAKI]
Okay, great. What do they say?

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.800
Well, it's important to
understand that fortunes

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.470
can be quite
ambiguous sometimes,

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:01.220
so readings don't always
determine a specific outcome.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.350
In the end, that depends
on how the couple reacts.

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:06.640
We appreciate that very
thorough disclaimer,

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.230
but would you mind
getting to the point?

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:11.520
You might just be a
match made in heaven!

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:12.900
I'm sorry, what?

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.270
[ITO] And there's something
else you should know.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.990
Wait, really?

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:17.780
Out of all the cards I've seen,

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.910
none have foretold a more
perfect pairing than you two!

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.580
This card shows that you
have natural chemistry!

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.870
This one represents
mutual trust!

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:28.410
And this one here foretells
a sound and stable future!

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.630
Oh, but this one means
you're the perfect couple!

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.290
Oh, it's incredible!

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.550
You really <i>can</i> get
all these cards at once!

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.090
[BLACK HOOD A grunts]

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.760
[BLACK HOOD B] Oh dear, looks
like Sister Ito's on a roll.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.470
[ITO] Ah, that's right. I'd
heard through the grapevine

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:43.760
that you aren't
actually a couple.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:45.140
Is that the truth?

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.730
[UZAKI, SAKURAI gasp]

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:50.940
I see, and you're so compatible,
too. What a waste of potential.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.650
If nothing's stopping you,
why not go for it?

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:55.270
[SAKURAI grunting]

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.150
Who could even say?

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.950
Usually I just get single folks.

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.570
It's rare for a couple to come
in together like you did.

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.320
For a moment I thought
you were official

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:05.240
and only stopping by for kicks!

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.580
I bet everyone in line
thought the same thing.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:08.830
Can't blame 'em.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.210
You should just go out
with each other already!

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.750
Your spiritual alignment
is totally off the charts!

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.290
Like, remember that
time you fell asleep

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:17.340
in each other's arms
after class, and then...

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.670
[BLACK HOOD A] All right, girl.
Time to wrap it up now.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.010
[BLACK HOOD B]
No one likes a show-off.

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.430
[UZAKI exhales]
Just think about the console.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:32.020
[ASAI] Level with me,
was that a true reading,

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.310
or something you made up?

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.900
It was real, obviously.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.150
[BLACK HOOD A]
Don't you worry.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:40.360
You'll never catch
Sister Ito phoning it in.

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:43.160
[ASAI]
You mean it? That's a relief.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.080
Thanks again for letting me
be a fly on the wall today.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.080
[BLACK HOOD A]
You satisfied?

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:52.920
Oh yeah. I'm all set!

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.880
[BLACK HOOD A]
Uh, good for you...

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.630
I'm off to trail those two
before they get too far.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:02.090
Well, enjoy the festival.
Catch you girls later!

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:05.760
[GROUP]
Bye Ami. See you at the café!

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:12.310
[SAKAKI]
So, how'd it go?

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:15.900
If it had gone any better,
I would've ODed on euphoria.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.480
[SAKAKI sighs]
It's all going as planned.

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:21.900
In other news,
I've become a potato.

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:23.820
[ASAI]
Go home and get some sleep.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.870
[SAKAKI]
I can't leave quite yet.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:28.530
I've still got
post-event clean-up.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:32.290
How did it come to this?

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:36.000
I'm not even on
the dang committee.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.210
Enjoy your nap, then.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.920
[ASAI] I didn't see the point in
going through with this plan

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.170
the first time it was
explained to me.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.050
It seemed like too much
work for too little payoff.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.760
But after catching
the occult edition

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:52.350
of the Sakuzaki show,
call me a believer!

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.730
Still though, blowing
everything on the lead-up

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:58.610
just to miss out on the climax
must be devastating.

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:01.480
Cheers to you for fighting
the good fight, Itsuhito.

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:05.780
Thank you for your service.
G'night, sweet prince.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.070
Uh! Where'd they go?

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:13.160
How'd I lose them already?

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.750
[UZAKI]
You feeling better now?

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.760
Yeah, I think so. Sorry,
I wasn't expecting all that.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.510
Hey, me either.
Nothing to be sorry for.

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:29.890
Anyway, I bet this was one
of Sakaki's stupid tricks,

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:33.180
that dork. Kinda hacky
if you ask me.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:37.520
Itsuhito, huh? I could see that.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.980
[SAKURAI]
Damn, what's wrong with me.

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.440
Why can't I look
Uzaki in the eye?

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:46.990
Crap, that reading better not
have awoken something in her.

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:49.450
[UZAKI]
Can I ask you something?

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:52.450
That stuff about us
being like, compatible.

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:53.830
What do you think?

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:56.660
Oh, that stuff Ito was saying?

00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:00.880
[SAKURAI] Could you ask a more
loaded question? What do I say?

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.750
Well, guess it's better
than being incompatible.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.420
Better to get along, right?

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.350
[UZAKI laughs]

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:15.770
[SAKURAI gasping]

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.520
[UZAKI] Eh, I wouldn't try
to read into it too much.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.730
Huh?

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:20.980
At the end of the day,

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.820
fortune telling's nothing
more than a game.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.280
[SAKURAI]
I'll take your word for it.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.490
[UZAKI humming]

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:31.990
[SAKURAI] Seems like she's
taking this pretty well.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.410
[UZAKI laughs]

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:38.160
[LOTTERY STAFF A]
We have a winner!

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:39.160
[WINNER A]
Woo-hoo!

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.420
[CROWD cheering]

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.130
We should've asked
those kooks to predict

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:47.510
our luck with
this raffle instead.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.010
[GROUP chattering]

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:51.050
[NARRATOR] Two days had passed
after that awkward event,

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.180
and the festival
stalls came down.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.970
With classes out, it was a
welcome moment of respite

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.180
for anyone who wasn't working.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:01.690
Despite that, Sakurai
was still preoccupied.

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:03.820
[SAKURAI]
Man, what's going on?

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.980
My brain's like spaghetti.

00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:08.440
I can't get her words
out of my head.

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:10.990
You might just be a
match made in heaven!

00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:13.490
You're so compatible, too.
What a waste of potential.

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:16.540
If nothing's stopping you,
why not go for it?

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.540
[SAKURAI sighs] But if it's up
to the couple in the end,

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:22.540
then she should just
mind her business!

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:26.300
[NARRATOR] And that wasn't the
only thing bothering Sakurai.

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:30.220
[SAKURAI]
And what was with that face

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.510
Uzaki was making earlier?

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.640
In any case, she doesn't
look too concerned.

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.730
Yo, is there anything
I can help with?

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:45.110
[UZAKI]
Nah, I got this covered.

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.780
Just gotta chop these
veggies and heat 'em up.

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.190
All right then.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.240
[UZAKI] Besides, you gotta
level up your chef skills

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.200
before you're allowed to help.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.660
Don't need you
getting in the way.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.330
[SAKURAI grunts]

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:59.700
[UZAKI] Don't pout. Can you can
set the table for us instead?

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:01.500
Food's almost ready, anyway.

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.830
Yeah, 'course no problem.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.340
[SAKURAI] She's even less
bothered than I thought,

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.300
and she did say fortunes
were just a game.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.680
Plus, she came here to cook
for me. I should relax.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.890
Right, no more freaking
out about this.

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:25.810
Just be your normal, everyday
self. Be like Uzaki.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.110
[UZAKI laughs]

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:29.570
[NARRATOR]
However, Sakurai was mistaken.

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.990
Though she appeared
nonchalant on the surface,

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.910
Uzaki was in fact over
the moon with joy.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:38.620
Be careful not to burn yourself.
Hot pot comin' through!

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:41.200
[NARRATOR] A few years had
passed since high school.

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:43.410
And though she hadn't
considered their compatibility

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.630
much during their time
as acquaintances,

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:48.250
it had now received
a seal of approval,

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:51.380
rendering her beside
herself with glee.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.970
But Uzaki's interpretation

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:56.220
of this news differed
slightly from his.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.930
[UZAKI] If those cards say
we're perfect for each other,

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:02.270
then this chump's even more of
a lost cause than I thought.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.560
[NARRATOR]
Emotional bias!

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.650
A type of cognitive partiality
that causes one to favor

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:11.150
whatever version of the
truth is most convenient.

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:12.860
[UZAKI] Guess I better
keep looking out for him,

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.900
so he doesn't become
an absolute recluse.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:17.120
[NARRATOR]
For Uzaki, it was

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.830
a moment of good
fortune, so to speak.

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:21.580
Dude, this looks incredible!

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.660
[UZAKI]
I mean, it makes total sense.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.410
I'm basically the only woman

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.960
who gives the poor
guy any attention.

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.670
[NARRATOR]
Of course, biased thoughts

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:33.260
born from biased truths
can soon start to run amok.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:37.590
[UZAKI] Honestly, I'm sure he
could tell Ito was right, too.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.220
He was as red as a beet!

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.640
[NARRATOR]
Eventually...

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:44.100
[UZAKI] Aw. Is he finally
starting to warm up to me?

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.640
[NARRATOR]
...biased thoughts...

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:48.480
[UZAKI] He can't keep
his eyes off me! Heh.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.980
[NARRATOR]
...can explode!

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:53.570
[UZAKI] It's official! This
loser can't live without me!

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:55.860
[NARRATOR]
Thus, a monstrous, one-sided,

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.660
and self-serving
conclusion was formed.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.330
[UZAKI]
Yeah! Me and Sakurai forever!

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:05.870
We can't help it.
We're just two peas in a pod!

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:07.160
[NARRATOR]
Though Uzaki's delusions

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:10.090
aren't the only
ones at fault here.

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:13.050
[SAKURAI] She's smiling
more than usual today,

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:15.590
probably plotting
something to bug me later.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:17.470
[UZAKI]
Penny for your thoughts?

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.010
What?

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:20.760
I dunno, it seems like there's
something you've been dying

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:22.890
to tell me. Just sayin'.

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:26.520
I really appreciate you cooking
again. I was starving.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.600
You're so welcome!

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:29.520
But c'mon, wasn't there
somethin' else?

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.860
Food's tasty as ever.
You're a seriously great chef.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.190
You can praise me all day,

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.570
but aren't you leaving
somethin' out?

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:37.490
Oh, my bad, I forgot
to hit you back

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.160
for the grocery shopping!
I promise I'll pay you later.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.740
You're killing me right now.

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:43.080
Pass the ponzu?

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.910
[UZAKI groans]

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:47.410
[NARRATOR]
Still, a partner is a partner.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.670
You okay, Uzaki?
You're kinda shaking.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.920
Y'know what,
you're a real idiot.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.800
How dare he play coy with me.
He isn't ready!

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.430
Hold up, what's gotten
into you all of a sudden?

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.680
Was it something I said,
or am I eating too slowly?

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:03.930
[UZAKI growls]

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:06.180
[SAKURAI] Tell me what
it is! I'll apologize!

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:09.560
Ugh, you big dum-dum!

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.810
[UZAKI] Never mind.
He's just an ignoramus.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.730
Uzaki?

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.900
Look, just hurry up and finish
your food already, would ya!

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:19.070
You blockhead! I can't stand...

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:20.570
Fine, I'll eat!

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.620
Now quit hitting the table
before you knock the stew over.

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:24.330
Jeez, it's really
not a big deal!

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.370
[UZAKI] Look at him,
acting all oblivious.

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:28.500
He truly is hopeless, huh?

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.000
[SAKURAI]
Hm...

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.630
[UZAKI] Then again, he's never
been the eager type, so...

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.960
I guess I'll leave
it alone for now.

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:40.170
After all, the ball's in his
court and there's plenty

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:43.680
for me to think about
in the meantime! Yep!

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.890
[NARRATOR] Choosing to not rock
the boat and instead,

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:47.850
silently celebrate her win,

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:51.350
Uzaki also chickened
out in the end.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.150
Though the fortune
had shaken them,

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:55.770
the pair found
serenity once more.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:57.780
Pass the pepper flakes?

00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.230
[UZAKI]
Here.

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:02.240
[BOTH gasp]

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:07.580
[NARRATOR] That being said,
their relationship

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.580
had changed in a small
yet unmistakable way.
