00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.090
[NARRATOR] It had been three
days since his free trial.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.220
Thanks to his prior
athletic experience,

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.110
Sakurai found himself
fitting right in at the gym.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.280
By devoting himself to
strenuous physical activities,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.240
he found it easier
to clear his mind

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.280
of any trivial worries
from the day.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.070
Nevertheless, some
thoughts persisted.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.990
You got this, Shinichi.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.030
[SAKURAI grunting]

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.330
[SAKURAI] I'm too weak.
Gotta train harder.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.250
It's been kinda quiet
around here lately, huh.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.010
Okay, time to bench.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.520
Man, you sure are full
of energy today.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.770
I hope you're letting your
muscles recover properly.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.140
You know it.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.940
I'm not gonna lie, I've had
a lot on my mind lately.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.900
But as long as I wear
myself out in the gym,

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.310
I sleep like a log.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.400
That's nice to hear, but aren't
you a little too young

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.330
to be training your
life away like a monk?

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.120
Oh, and speaking of people
who don't know when to quit.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.290
[SAKURAI] Here comes Fuji.
How are you, sir?

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.500
Well, if it isn't Sakurai!
Need a spotter today, kiddo?

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.620
Yeah that would
be great, thanks.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.420
[IMURA] He's determined to sweat
away every last bit of anxiety.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.540
Call it a hunch, I get the
feeling you've got somethin'

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.220
on your mind. Oh ho-ho, I know!

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.090
Let me guess--
it's a woman, isn't it?

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.470
You got nothing to worry
'bout in that department.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.770
You're a handsome kid with a
nice head on your shoulders,

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:03.930
ya know what I mean?

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.810
The birds'll come
flockin' to you, stud!

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.060
Well, you were right.
Fuji doesn't stop until

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.070
he's up to his elbows in
something he shouldn't be.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.900
Yep. Stay strong.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.360
Fortunately, if you're ever
looking for life advice,

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.070
there're always plenty
of experienced dudes

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.780
around here who can mentor you.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.320
Including this old hack,
of course!

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.080
Then again, I've got
concerns of my own.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.250
Cause my eldest daughter's
been driving me up the wall.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.080
It turns out she's been
going crazy over this

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.380
friend from school
she's been seeing.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.630
So, what happened to the
master offering wisdom?

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.550
Yo, you really shouldn't
be airing out your kid's

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.130
dirty laundry behind
her back like this.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.260
I just wanted to vent my issues
in a safe space for a bit!

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.300
Guess you were the one who
was jonesing for life advice.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.680
Fine then. We'll listen,

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.180
but only 'cause she
doesn't lift here.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.440
You wanna start by telling us
how old your daughter is?

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.310
She's a 20-year-old in college.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.440
Actually, she's about
your age, Sakurai.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.850
[SAKURAI]
Oh, really?

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.690
I know you're worried about her,
but it sounds like she's

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.280
an adult, so you
should butt out.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.280
She's capable of
paving her own way.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.530
She's absolutely not!

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.450
If you ask me, 20 years
old is still a child!

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.120
Is that so?

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.200
Well, Sakurai's from the same
generation. What's his take?

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.250
Ya know, it's honestly
hard to say.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.250
Some folks my age act like
adults, and some not so much.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.830
[FUJIO]
Mm-hm.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.090
Either way, though, at the end
of the day I think it depends

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.050
on the individual we're
talking about, right?

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.720
Because you could
technically be full grown,

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.340
but if the way you act
doesn't reflect that,

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.390
then you might as well still
be a child since that's how

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.060
you're deciding to walk
through your life.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.020
Whoa. That was an impressive
answer you came up with.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.230
I-I'm sorry, just forget it.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.770
Whatever I said was
probably outta line.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.020
Nothing to worry about
kiddo. You're good.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.030
So how far into a relationship
is she with this guy?

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.360
Are they in a rough patch?

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.940
That's the funny
thing, actually.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.370
From what I can tell, things
haven't gotten that heavy.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.450
[KUROKI]
Uh... If nothing's happened,

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.700
then what's there
to worry about?

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.590
[FUJIO] I'm not really sure,
but something's goin' on.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.000
According to my daughter,
they're pretty tight at school.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.540
Apparently, they've known
each other for a while.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.340
He's a lone wolf
who lives by himself,

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.210
so she hangs out
with him on the regular.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.390
To top it all off, she even
cooks for the lucky guy.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.970
But he still hasn't made
a move on my girl.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.340
Something's not adding up.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.890
Not to call her out, but
are you sure your daughter

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.680
is telling the whole
truth about this stuff?

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.440
She isn't making
anything up, right?

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.730
I know she isn't though.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.650
Whenever she tries to sneak
something past me,

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:14.980
she glances to the right.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.950
Do you not realize that
memorizing your daughter's

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.070
tells makes you a
helicopter parent?

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.990
But if they've spent
that much time together

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.570
and he hasn't even
budged an inch...

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.290
It means there's only
one logical explanation.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.250
And what would that be, exactly?

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.660
[BOTH]
Whoever this guy might be,

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.090
he just isn't into your
daughter like that!

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.460
No, that can't be!

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.250
My baby girl's as
cute as a button,

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.680
in case you idiots forgot!

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.420
Don't you think
that's a bit biased?

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.840
Between you and your kid,

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.880
it seems you're the one
that has a credibility issue.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.850
No, I don't because
it's the truth!

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.060
About this supposed boyfriend,

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.890
assuming he is into
your baby girl,

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.560
isn't it a good thing
that he's respectful

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.060
instead of pouncing on
her like a wild beast?

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.490
[FUJIO grunts]

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.440
[UZAKI] He's always been a loner
ever since high school.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.570
He's so hopeless,
I can't help but look out

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:01.900
for the poor schmuck, okay?

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.530
You're head over heels!

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.740
[ALL gasping]

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.990
He's giving her
the cold shoulder.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.130
I don't know if I should curse
the guy or praise his name.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.120
Fujio's a complicated soul.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.210
Let's get a youngun's opinion.
What do you think, Sakurai?

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.460
Uh. I couldn't really say.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.510
It doesn't feel right weighing
in when I don't know

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.430
what type of person he is,
but if I were the guy

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.220
and a girl I liked
stopped by to hang,

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.510
I suppose I wouldn't wanna
move too aggressively

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.770
if she was that important to me.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:35.440
That's so thoughtful.
You truly are pure of heart.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.770
Uhh...

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.110
[FUJIO]
It's nice to know you care.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.940
And kudos to you, Casanova.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.070
I can tell you've got
a special someone, too.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.190
[SAKURAI] I was being totally
hypothetical just now,

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.450
so can we please get back
to the topic at hand?

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.950
Anyway, moving on. If we're
dealing with that type

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:50.360
of thinking, then I
bet your daughter's

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:51.910
real important to
her mystery man.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.750
Y'know what,
you're probably right.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.120
Sure wish I could know
for certain though.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.130
I do wonder what
he's actually like.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.380
Now I'm curious, too.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:02.800
What can you do,

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.420
I guess I won't know
until I meet the guy.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:05.720
Might as well get
back to trainin'.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.390
Speaking of which,
you can start by

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:08.720
helping me out with my squats.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.180
You enjoy your workout,
my friends.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.930
He might go off later, but it
seems he's cheered up for now.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.190
At least he's smiling again.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:17.730
We haven't been
acquainted for long,

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.850
but I can tell you're
wise beyond your years.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.230
Because of what I said?

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.490
I don't think I've ever
been told that before.

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.490
[NARRATOR] It's said that the
endorphins and adrenaline

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.860
released during bouts of
intense physical training

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:30.370
can lift one's spirits
and provide

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.620
a noticeable
psychological boost.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.370
And though he trained hard
while on the swim team,

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.050
Sakurai's naturally introverted
countenance kept

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.920
whatever social confidence
he may have had at bay.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.880
However, thanks to the
interpersonal skills he gained

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.250
through two years of
earnest customer service,

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.550
and the pure exhilaration
of rediscovering exercise,

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.480
it was as though a
pair of twin gears

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.390
had finally clicked into place

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:57.060
and a change was beginning
to stir from deep within.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.730
He still hasn't read it.

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.610
He isn't working today,
so what's the deal?

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.110
[YANAGI] You wanna play some
video games, Hana?

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.830
Nah. I'm not in the mood.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.410
Aw. Well how 'bout you, Kiri?

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.490
We haven't played a
versus match in forever.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.330
You can forget it, sis.
We both know you're just

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:18.660
gonna end up
winning like always.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.170
If you start to
feel like giving up,

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:21.790
then I could go easy on you.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.720
[KIRI] Dude, that's the
most humiliating part!

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.720
[UZAKI grumbles]

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:32.970
[UZAKI] I wonder if he found
another hobby or something?

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.260
He might be spending time alone.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:37.480
[gasps]

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.480
[UZAKI] Finally, fool had me
worried for a second.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.520
"Me and mom will be waiting up
for you. Looking forward to it."

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:47.240
Mood change alert! You texting
that friend of yours?

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.110
No, I am not!

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.370
[NARRATOR]
As though on cue,

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.830
Hana Uzaki instinctively
glanced to her right.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.500
Nothing like a nice,
long soak in the tub

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.620
to wash all the mess
and stress away.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.380
[YANAGI]
Aw, c'mon, Hana!

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.380
Pretty please with
a cherry on top?

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:03.710
Why didn't you invite me?

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:06.250
I wanna hang out with your
mysterious man friend.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.760
[UZAKI] Urgh. Hey, he isn't
some kinda show pony

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.550
I can trot out. Quit
stretching my hoodie!

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.060
I hate to ruin the surprise,

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.060
but he's not all that
interesting to look at.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.770
Unless you're into shut-ins
with creepy eyes.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.770
Didn't stop you from
falling for him.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.940
For the last time, he likes me
not the other way around!

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.270
Hey, Mom.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.070
Are we still good for our
cooking lesson tomorrow?

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.570
[YANAGI]
Mom, can you do me a favor?

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:30.860
Will you take a
picture of Hana's

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.240
man crush and send it to me?

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.070
[UZAKI] Don't listen to her!
She's being annoying!

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.910
Would you two stop horsing
around in the hallway

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.410
before you break something!

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:40.370
I'll behave if you let me take
off from school tomorrow!

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.670
[TSUKI] Absolutely not! Ugh,
you are not playing hooky.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.170
Who are you, your father?

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:46.630
While we're on the subject,

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:48.880
there's something I needed
to tell you about tomorrow.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.250
Uh?

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.430
[UZAKI]
Mom said something came up.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.300
That's why she didn't join us.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:56.850
No worries.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.020
Lucky for us, everything
still turned out great.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.270
Thanks to your mom's recipe.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.770
You're coming along in
your cooking journey.

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.390
All that hard work
is payin' off.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.940
[SAKURAI]
Huh?

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.560
You've made so many delicious
things. And it's practically

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.860
like you're living in
our kitchen these days.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.940
Is that so? I guess.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.570
But don't you think you're
forgetting something?

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.040
The real reason you've
been coming over?

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.330
[SAKURAI grunts]

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:23.750
[TSUKI]
Those two must be wrapping up

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.040
their cooking lesson
now, which means...

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.800
[ASAI] Is everything
all right, Mrs. Uzaki?

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.170
You've been looking
kinda stressed out

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.390
ever since you walked in.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.880
I'm sorry, have I?

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:36.060
I'm just hoping for
things to go well today.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.560
Things are still so
uncertain, you know?

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.180
Yeah, I definitely
know what you mean.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.730
[TSUKI] This is for the best.
They'll be alone in the kitchen.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.940
Surely something'll happen.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.070
And without me there to
serve as a distraction,

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.110
Hana will have his
undivided attention.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.660
Forgive me, Sakurai.
I have a family.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:01.830
I can't return your feelings.
So, take my daughter's instead!

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.000
I don't know, Dad.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.330
Relax, sweetheart.
Let's just leave her be.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.380
[NARRATOR]
And so, as Tsuki Uzaki

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.250
persisted in her
misunderstanding,

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:12.680
both father and daughter
watched her suffer in silence.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.180
It's happening. All my
dreams have come true.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.350
Shyshka already gets along
well with people

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.720
so I figured she'd be down
for some cuddles with you.

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.310
I'd introduce you to this one,
but Nika's a scaredy-cat,

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:24.770
she's not quite there yet.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:27.060
The fact I even get to hold
one of them is incredible,

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:28.440
so don't worry about it.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.230
Thanks for letting me
hang out with your kitties.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.660
Hm? Huh, that's funny. There's
something different about you.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.120
You seem less creepy than usual.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.450
What's that supposed to mean,

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.410
am I usually creepy
or something?

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:42.080
[UZAKI] Is it me,
or is he glowing today?

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.800
[UZAKI] Seriously.
What's gotten into him?

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.550
[SAKURAI]
Uzaki!

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:53.510
Your cat started purring and
her throat got all rumbly.

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:55.470
That means she's in a
really good mood, right?

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.340
Yeah, that means
she's happy to see you.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.560
No need to freak out.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.690
So soft. I can die a happy man.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.010
[UZAKI] Ah, whatever.
I'm just imagining things.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.860
[TSUKI]
Good grief, I thought for sure

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.480
he would've gone home by now.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.900
[SAKURAI]
Oh. Hey, Ms. Tsuki!

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.690
[TSUKI] I didn't think I'd run
into him on my way back!

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.280
Thanks a bunch.
That recipe was amazing.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.780
How sweet. Why, you're
very welcome, of course.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.290
Did everything you make
turn out all right?

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:25.910
I imagine you put in quite
a bit of effort today.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.750
Yeah. Well to be honest,

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.620
the actual cooking lesson
itself went off without a hitch.

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.170
But afterwards,
I guess you could say

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:33.960
I stuck around for a while.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.220
[TSUKI] What does he mean
by that? Could it be...?

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.800
Did something special
happen while I was out?

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.590
Wow, I gotta say I'm
a little embarrassed

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.310
that you read me so easily.
But you totally called it.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.350
And if I'm telling the truth,

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.020
I've been interested
for a while now.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.270
Well, I can see why you'd
stick around for that.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:49.390
[SAKURAI]
Right!

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.980
Oh, it must've been
exciting for you.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:51.890
You know it.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.020
You and Hana finally...

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:54.950
Hana let me hold her puss-puss!

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.320
[NARRATOR]
As in the cat.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.490
[gasping]

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.780
Every part of that moment
felt warm and soft,

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.160
and I could tell she was
really enjoying it, too.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.620
[NARRATOR]
Again, the cat.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.490
[TSUKI] My goodness.
I'm at a loss for words.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.170
I did want to make sure
Hana's feelings

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:12.210
weren't unrequited,
but not this quickly.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.130
He's moving from
zero to a hundred!

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.380
It's entirely possible
that I'm just being greedy,

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.550
and I probably am
asking for way too much.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.050
But it would be
incredible if I got

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.380
to hold two of them at
the same time someday.

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:24.720
[NARRATOR]
He meant two cats.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.430
[SAKURAI laughing]

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:30.140
[SAKURAI]
Oops, didn't mean to keep you.

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:32.940
Catch ya next time, Ms. Tsuki!

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.560
[TSUKI]
Uh. Uh-huh...

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.820
[TSUKI]
My, his appetite is insatiable.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.110
He's more relentless than
a bloodthirsty young wolf!

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.950
[NARRATOR] Thus, the needless
angst of Tsuki Uzaki toiled on.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.710
How shall I quell the hunger
of this ravenous beast?

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.580
Leave it alone, lady!

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.550
[ALL] Happy birthday!
We love you so much, Mom!

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.510
Aw, what a pleasant surprise!

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:02.970
Go ahead and take
a load off, Mom.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:04.970
By the way, how old
are you now-- [groans]

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:07.300
Your Mom comes from a long
line of baby-faced folks

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:08.720
who've pretty much
never seen a wrinkle.

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:10.940
That's right, she'll
look young forever!

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.190
Whaddaya say, wifeycakes,
should we try for a fourth?

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.020
Maybe you should chill
out on the dirty talk

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:16.740
while we're in the room?

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.200
[YANAGI]
G'morning everybody.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.490
Whoa. What's with you guys?

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:23.320
Why're you all quiet?

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:24.950
[KIRI, UZAKI grunt]

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:29.780
[FUJIO] You work so hard, dear.
Anything I can help with?

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:32.250
[TSUKI] Careful, darling.
I almost dropped my spatula.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.580
Hello, Yanagi,
I didn't see you come in.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:35.750
You'll have to
forgive your mother

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:37.500
since she might have
overslept a little.

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:39.260
Breakfast should be
ready in just a second,

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.630
all right my darlings?

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:42.880
[YANAGI]
Uhh--

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:44.350
[NARRATOR]
At times like these,

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:46.720
it was better to keep
one's mouth shut.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.970
Oh, for crying out loud,

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:49.550
you'd think it's still
the woman's birthday.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.600
[UZAKI]
Uh! Birthday?

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.520
Wait a sec. Now that
I think about it...

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.850
I just realized I don't know
when Sakurai's birthday is!

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:02.360
[YANAGI] Uh oh. That's
definitely an "oh, crap" face.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.780
[SAKAKI] Care to explain
why you called me here

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.150
on such short notice?

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.450
Or does our buddy Saku have
something to do with it?

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:10.910
As the Sakurai whisperer,
I assume you know

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:13.330
everything there is to know
about that big dummy.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:15.410
So, I humbly beg
for your expertise!

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.460
Okay, no need to get on
your hands and knees.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:18.710
You've already
caught my interest

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:20.170
and I'm willing to listen.

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:21.750
So, what exactly
do you want to know?

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.090
Well, I was hoping you
could tell me his birthday!

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:27.090
[SAKAKI grunts]

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.510
[SAKAKI]
Not to beat a dead horse,

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.890
but do you remember what I
said about this last time?

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:33.310
How you should hurry things up
and make a move already?

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:34.600
Because no offense,

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.520
but I was hoping you
could do better than this.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.850
[ASAI]
Whoa. This is the first time

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.440
I've ever seen him lose morale.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.150
As if all of that
hard work went nowhere.

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:45.030
[laughs] I suppose it
just slipped my mind.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.740
[CAFÉ OWNER] Not to worry, dear.
We can help you with that.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.990
We had a little birthday
celebration for Sakurai

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.580
when he turned 20 last year.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.540
We all stayed after closing
and had cake.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.210
[UZAKI]
Wait, really? No fair!

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:57.170
[SAKAKI]
How? He's their employee!

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:59.880
So, what is it you're trying
to pull off here, Uzaki.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.420
Is somebody trying to
make sure the loner

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.210
doesn't feel neglected
on his big day?

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.050
[laughs] How adorable.

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:06.550
It's not about that!

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.220
I don't wanna be the kind of
friend who doesn't even know

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.300
his birthday when I'm
pretty sure he knows mine.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:12.770
That would make me an
awful friend, don't you think?

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:14.730
So, it's about feeling guilty.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:16.100
Ah, there's no
reason to hide it,

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.260
so you might as well know

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:19.020
that Sakurai was born
on November 29th.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.140
Hold on, that's just
around the corner!

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.480
Good thing I asked
before it was too late.

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.490
And it's an easy one to
remember because it happens

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:27.320
to fall on
National Beefcake Day.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.440
[SAKAKI]
Maybe for a degenerate like you.

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.120
Come to think of it,
I don't know what kind

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.700
of present I should
get him. In my experience,

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:35.460
it always seems like
you can barely get him

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.920
to crack a smile, no
matter how much you try.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.540
Trust me, we're very familiar.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.750
Our party last year
was actually a surprise,

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.880
but it didn't go over
how we'd planned.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.090
You didn't need to go through
all this trouble just for me.

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:48.590
Wow, what a blah reaction.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.310
Buzzkiller.

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:52.810
Yeah, that's our
meathead loner boy.

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:58.400
Try this out.
But use it responsibly.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.900
[UZAKI]
Mm...

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.270
[CAFÉ OWNER]
Seriously, dear?

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.450
I thought you were finished
with the risky outfits.

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:06.700
Isn't this a bit much?

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.700
[ASAI] I
don't need you judging me, Dad.

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.870
It's not like it would be
on company time anyway!

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:12.240
My goodness.

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.610
Maybe I should've spent
more time with you as a kid.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.200
Sakaki please?

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:18.330
I have faith that you'll
think of something in time.

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:19.830
[UZAKI]
Thanks, buttmunch!

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:21.290
You know him better than anyone,
and I bet you'll know how

00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:23.330
to impress him once you
put your mind to it.

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:24.630
Huh?

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:30.760
[NARRATOR] Then the big day
had arrived. November 29th.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.050
Happy birthday!

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.310
Ready to have lots of fun
on your special day?

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:36.680
I was wracking my brain for
days trying to figure out

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:39.270
ways to celebrate,
but I couldn't decide.

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:42.100
Thank you, but you really didn't
need to go outta your way.

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:43.650
It was turning
into a real chore,

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.360
so I thought we'd
just do it all!

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.190
Should I thank you
for your service now?

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.120
First things first, a hot meal!

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.330
C'mon sweaty!

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.400
You just gonna keep
digging tunnels all day?

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:56.700
No fair! Quit setting up
those stupid bombs already.

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.000
Can you believe he gets
away with it in the end?

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.250
Hey peanut gallery,
lay off on the spoilers.

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.180
Whoops. Totally didn't
mean to do ruin it,

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:08.250
won't let it happen again.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.220
Yeah, you sound sorry.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.590
[UZAKI] Are you finished with
that volume yet, slowpoke?

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.600
[SAKURAI] Almost. Gimme five
more minutes and it's yours.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:29.440
[UZAKI]
Oof, that was fun!

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:31.950
So how ya feeling about
turning 21, birthday boy?

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:33.570
Have you been enjoying yourself?

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.790
I can't say it feels very
different from any other year

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:39.540
in my life. Still,
it's been a blast so far.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.000
Of course, you big goof.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.750
It must be awesome
getting to celebrate

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:44.120
with a party queen like me.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:45.920
Especially when you're
a nerd who wouldn't know

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.920
how to let loose if
his life depended on it.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.340
Feel free to get down on your
knees and thank me at any time.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.590
Yeah, it is pretty awesome.
Thanks for hanging out all day.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:58.810
Don't get mushy,
the pleasure's all mine.

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.180
I can't believe you
even brought a cake.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:03.060
But I do feel kinda bad
that you went through

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.810
so much trouble for me.

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:05.980
Not to ruin the mood,

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.020
but I'm not sure how
to return the favor.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:10.240
Listen, there's no need to
worry your messy little head

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.740
about any of that when
you're the man of the hour.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.780
That's real sweet of you,
but still.

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.070
[UZAKI]
Uh. Ooh, I know. How about this?

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.080
If you want, you could always
try to hit me back next year.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.450
You're not the only one
with a birthday, ya know?

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:24.670
[SAKURAI] Mm. Guess we could
celebrate yours, too.

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:26.840
I know you suck at planning,
but at least try!

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:27.960
And the better you do,

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.420
the better your next
birthday will be!

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.290
And if you can manage to
blow my socks off,

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:32.720
I might give you
points for being

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.300
extra-sweet and
leaving the house.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.010
Points towards what now?

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:37.930
Points towards your Uzakimiles!

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:41.140
[SAKURAI] Uzakimiles?
What are you, an airline?

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.930
[SAKURAI] Maybe it's 'cause
I've been hitting the gym,

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.980
but I feel like my head's
gotten a lot clearer.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.440
Sure, she gets on my nerves,

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.270
but I'm in a better mood
when she's around.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.940
Whenever she's making a fuss,

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.410
I know it's only
because she cares.

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:58.530
No matter what kind
of messes we get into,

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:03.290
it really is fun hanging out.
She makes it fun.

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:07.540
Damn, she got me good. I
actually wanna return the favor.

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:10.540
Better not let on, though.
It'll go straight to her head.

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:12.760
I'll try to keep that
in mind for next year.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.130
Whaddaya mean, you'll try?

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:16.210
I wanna hear you say
that you'll do it.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.090
All right, whatever,
it's a promise.

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:19.890
If we commit to this,
we could make it

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:21.470
a regular thing from now on!

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:22.930
Let's not get carried away.

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:24.640
[UZAKI laughing]

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.310
[SAKURAI] I mean, after next
year, I'll be graduating.

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:28.850
Huh?

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:35.320
[SAKURAI]
Hm? Uzaki?

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.690
[UZAKI gasping]

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.950
[UZAKI]
It's just like what Sakaki said.

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.280
[SAKAKI] You might want to make
a move sooner rather than later.

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:42.910
[UZAKI]
That jerk was right.

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.580
I've only got a year
and some change left.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:49.750
What am I supposed to do
with so little time?

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:52.830
And this idiot doesn't even
seem to be in any kind of hurry.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.300
What a pain.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.800
Ugh. At this rate,

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.970
he's totally gonna graduate
without knowing how I feel.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.140
And after that...

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.100
I...

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.640
I'll never get to...

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:10.820
[UZAKI]
Uh. Hey, Sakurai?

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:11.860
[SAKURAI]
What's up?

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:15.150
[UZAKI]
I, uh... Well you see, I...

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:17.480
I was just thinking that...

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:19.990
Seems you got something
serious on your mind.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:21.240
[UZAKI]
Mm-hm...

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.410
[SAKURAI] Well, it's
real honesty hours now.

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.160
You can let it out.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.370
No more hiding.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.300
I hope that you're ready
for things to get sincere.

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:32.580
[SAKURAI]
Go ahead.

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.050
I was thinking...

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:36.380
[gasps]

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:42.100
How 'bout getting
held back a year?

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.310
[SAKURAI] What? Why the hell
would I risk my degree?!

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:45.980
So you can have more
time to hang out with

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.310
your favorite person
before you walk, obviously!

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.310
[SAKURAI] Do you have any
idea how crazy you sound?

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:52.810
[UZAKI] You'll be eligible to
earn triple the Uzakimiles

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:54.400
if you let yourself
repeat a year!

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.650
[SAKURAI] Are you still on about
your imaginary points program?

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:58.400
Forget it, I'm not enrolling!

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:00.410
[UZAKI]
But think of the benefits!

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:02.330
[NARRATOR] It was then that
a sense of impatience

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:04.580
began to develop.
A pesky malaise

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.790
growing within
Hana Uzaki's heart.

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:09.540
[UZAKI] Seriously,
what am I gonna do?
