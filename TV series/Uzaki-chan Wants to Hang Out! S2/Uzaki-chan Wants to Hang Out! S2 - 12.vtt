[NARRATOR] Previously on
<i>Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!</i>

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.770
It was a family affair.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.440
[SHIRO]
If you don't do things right,

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.640
folks'll get the wrong
idea about her!

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.480
[NARRATOR]
In light of his father's advice,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.980
Sakurai decided to reconsider
his relationship with Hana.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.900
Though Christmas Eve
was quickly approaching,

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.980
their future remained uncertain.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.860
Hana was up to her
usual mischief

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.440
testing Sakurai's patience,
when suddenly...

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.780
[SAKURAI]
Never mind. She's the worst.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.410
[UZAKI]
Open up, you jerk!

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.280
[NARRATOR]
They had reached a new hurdle.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.750
The promise of a jolly holiday
looked increasingly unlikely.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.050
[ASAI sighs]

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.350
You know what I've finally
realized about you two?

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.720
When one of you tries to hit
the gas on your relationship,

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.060
the other slams the brakes.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.520
Yeah.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.020
The two of you couldn't
be more out of sync.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.360
[UZAKI gasps]

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.980
We're sick and tired
of you leading us on

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.820
with this stop-and-go nonsense.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.740
It's like you're completely
hopeless when it comes to love!

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.950
[CAFÉ OWNER]
What is this, an intervention?

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.660
And more importantly,

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.320
I'm not sure if you're
the one who should be

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.370
making those accusations,
my dear Ami.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.250
Why're you giving me
the third degree?

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.080
Sakurai's always
been a loner anyway,

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.170
so this isn't anything
worth worrying about.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.380
We'll just have to wait
until this all blows over!

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.590
[ASAI] There's no time with
Christmas Eve around the corner!

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.170
So, you're giving up
on the situation?

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.430
'Cause I was gonna turn down
these girls in our class

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.720
who asked me and Saku out,
but maybe we'll join 'em.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.060
[UZAKI gasps]

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.770
I really didn't wanna
stoop this low, trust me,

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.270
but you've left me no choice.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.400
I guess desperate times
call for desperate measures!

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.400
Screw letting things blow over,
I'm blowing them up!

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.870
Let's take a breath
and calm down.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.910
I have no doubt that
he'll forgive her.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.620
A sincere apology
should do the trick.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.410
You think so?

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.380
[YANAGI] Wait, what?
Let me get this straight.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.880
You pissed bestie off so badly
that he banned you from

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.550
his place? What the heck
were you even thinking, Hana?

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.220
If you don't pull
yourself together

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.590
and do some damage control,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.770
you'll be spending Christmas
all by your lonesome.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.220
You're gonna end up like Kiri.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.550
Hey! Don't act like you know
my business! I have plans!

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.600
Oh, that's right, you're meeting
up with your swim pals

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.440
and crying about how
you're all virgins.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.780
[KIRI] Uh! Dammit. That's
exactly what I was gonna do!

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.780
Would you lay off
the lecturing, please?

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.150
I've already apologized
to him a bunch.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.530
Besides, it's none of
your business, Yanagi.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.540
Au contraire!

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.410
--Gesundheit.
--Is that Spanish?

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:04.990
Gotta say, from
where I'm standing,

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.870
there're some obvious details
that you're failing to notice.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.710
And because it's
none of my business,

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.290
I'm free to stir things up
as much as I want.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.630
Wow, savage.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.590
[sighs] Look, do me
a favor and butt out.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.050
I know you're only poking fun,

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.090
but you shouldn't
tease Hana like that.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.560
Can't you see how this
is affecting her?

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.730
[YANAGI] Yeah, but she's
so slow on the uptake

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.560
that I can't help
if I get impatient.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.180
And her doofy man friend
doesn't make it any easier.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.940
He's kind of an airhead.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.270
What can I say?
They both amuse me to no end.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.780
[TSUKI sighs]

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.570
[KIRI] Note to self, if you ever
start crushing on someone,

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.530
make sure Yanagi
never finds out.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.030
[YANAGI] Still, it's almost the
25th. She can't give up yet.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.330
Not when she's
so close to the goal!

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.080
Which means it's my turn.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.160
I've gotta get in there
and work my magic!

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.880
It's a great day for a latte!

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.960
[UZAKI groans]

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.800
Hey there, Yanagi.
Good to see ya!

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.470
You've got something up
your sleeve, don't you?

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.180
You know it, girlfriend.
From what I hear, my big sis

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.400
happens to be in
a bit of a pinch.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.230
It appears she had a tiff
with Sakurai recently.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.770
Things have been a bit
awkward since then.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.030
Huh...

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.030
[ASAI] They're currently
at a bit of a stalemate.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.780
[YANAGI] Hana's probably too
nervous to break the ice first.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.030
At this rate, they're
gonna be stuck like this.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.290
Yeah, that's true.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.170
But what exactly are you
gonna do to change that?

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.750
[laughs]

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.710
Hey Sakurai, do you
have a second?

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.210
Huh?

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.210
Happened to learn about some
drama through the grapevine.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.340
Word is that you and
Hana had a big fight,

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.670
and now she's not
allowed to come over?

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.220
Uh, well.
That's more or less it.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.890
[UZAKI growls]

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.220
Yikers! And with the
holidays coming up fast,

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.900
that means you're gonna be in
for one lonely Christmas, huh?

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:51.980
Yeah.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.690
In that case,
why don't I come over

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.360
to keep you company that day?

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.360
[UZAKI gasps]
Wait? What are you--!

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.400
I'm way better at video
games than my sister,

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.020
so we'll have plenty of fun.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.490
[BOTH] Holy crap. That girl
just threw some major shade!

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.780
[ASAI] Wait, I get it. No wonder
Hana isn't being aggressive.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.790
She's never had to compete
with anyone for her prey!

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.960
This is the type of trickery
than can only come from

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.040
knowing every aspect of
someone's personality

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.840
and then using that against her!

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.380
[CAFÉ OWNER] Such diabolical
strategizing from a 14-year-old.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.590
[CAFÉ OWNER, ASAI]
What a twisted little sister!

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.640
Actually, why didn't
you ever try

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.850
making a dig at Hana
to help spur her on?

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.100
Come again? Dig what?

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.180
Oh, well. Never mind.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.440
Uhh, I might have to
get back to you on that.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.560
[ASAI] Not the most basic
response in the world!

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.240
I don't think there's
anyone more clueless

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.200
than that musclehead
over there.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.990
[YANAGI] Aw, c'mon!
I promise I won't bite.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.910
I know Hana's not allowed
to hang at your place,

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.370
but we're still cool, aren't we?

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.870
Well, yeah. I guess so.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:50.830
Hmm...

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.790
You can't hang with her! Huh?

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.160
For real? But why,
what's the problem?

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.750
I mean, it's not like
he invited you

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.670
in the first place,
so it isn't your concern.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.130
[UZAKI grunts]

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.420
What's the matter Hana?
You jealous or something?

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.970
[UZAKI] You can't do that
'cause I have a better idea!

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.130
Ooh!

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.510
I was thinking you
should come celebrate

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.930
Christmas Eve at our house!

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.400
What the--

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.980
[UZAKI] We got tons of video
games, Mom and I'll cook,

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.310
and you can pet
the cats all you want!

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.190
[YANAGI]
Hold on, is that a good idea?

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.610
[UZAKI]
Whaddaya say, Sakurai?

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.360
Since it's my home, the terms
of my exile don't apply!

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.570
I found a loophole!

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.280
Huh. Kay.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.370
I mean, I'm not
mad at her anymore

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:34.910
and I was gonna un-banish
her, so... Hmph.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.670
Okay, then, that settles it.
It's officially on the calendar.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.590
Heh! Glad it's in the books.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.960
Not trying to spoil the mood,
but you sure about this?

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.300
Cause I feel like you forgot
Dad's gonna be there too.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.810
[gasping]

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:51.270
You might wanna ask
if you can still

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.310
chill at Sakurai's instead.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.850
Yeah but, it'll
look too suspicious.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:57.810
Like I'm trying to make up
an excuse to spend

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.850
the holidays alone
with him in his apartment.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.110
Where's the lie though?

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.980
Okay, look!

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.660
I need you to stop
being a little weirdo

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.360
and quit stirring the pot
for no good reason.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.530
Wouldn't have to if you
weren't such a scaredy cat.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.530
[UZAKI] Ever heard of minding
your own business?

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.670
Anyway, don't worry about me!
I'll ask Dad about it!

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.370
[YANAGI]
Whatever, it's your funeral.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:17.160
Good luck with Daddy.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.920
[UZAKI] No turning back.
All I can do now is pray

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.290
that all this goes off
without a hitch.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.090

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:37.610
I love you guys, but I'm over
these sausage parties!

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:39.070
Next year'll be different!

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:42.200
I'm getting a girlfriend if
it's the last thing I do!

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.990
Good luck, man. For real.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.410
Speaking of which, your older
sister's pretty cute, isn't she?

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:49.570
[KIRI]
Mm?

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.450
Yeah, don't you
have two sisters?

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:52.820
Your mom's kinda cute, too!

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:55.290
[KIRI]
Knock it off, that's my mom!

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:58.710
But Kiri's the cutest
of them all, right?

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:00.460
[GROUP]
Uh...

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.420
As much as I'd like
to hate you right now,

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.840
I'm willing to put my feelings
aside for the moment.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.420
Consider yourself lucky.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:13.640
Look kid, I still need
your cooperation.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.140
Copy that.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:19.400
[FUJIO] That's right. Just have
as much fun as possible,

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.150
and no one will know.
I believe in you.

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.650
[NARRATOR] Though Fujio was
trying to save his hide,

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.980
he genuinely did have
the fatherly desire

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.610
to ensure his daughter's
peace of mind.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.950
Sakurai managed to
regain his composure,

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:35.740
and went to work livening up the
party like nothing had happened.

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:36.870
Here, Sakurai!

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.290
[NARRATOR]
He indulged in the food.

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:39.500
Say when, Sakurai!

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:40.750
[NARRATOR]
He drank his fill.

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:42.160
Nice, Sakurai!

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:45.380
[NARRATOR]
He gamed like a pro. However...

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.050
[SAKURAI whimpering]
Mr. Fujio.

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.130
[NARRATOR] Just as the
atmosphere finally began

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.300
to lighten up...

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:53.640
[SAKURAI]
Can we call a time out, please?

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.390
[FUJIO]
You're giving up already?!

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:58.930
[NARRATOR] The man of the hour
quickly threw in the towel.

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.480
[SAKURAI]
I don't think I can do this.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.650
It's too much pressure
trying to act natural

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:04.110
while keeping a secret.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.860
You literally had one job
but I guess it was too much

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:10.650
for you to handle. Although I
can't blame you since you tried.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:12.490
Hey, it's not my fault.

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:13.780
I didn't expect to
see you tonight

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:15.000
and it threw me for a loop.

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:16.920
But I guess it was
probably for the best

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.420
that we at least gave it a shot.

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.380
I guess.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.210
[SAKURAI] I wish that I
could just forget everything.

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:25.170
[FUJIO]
Hey, that's a great idea!

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:27.250
You know, that could
be another option.

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:29.260
How do hard you think I'd
need to bop you on the head

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.720
in order to make that happen?

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.970
I would much prefer to leave
violence as a last resort.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:36.480
Wait. That's perfect!

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.230
Yeah? I hope you got insurance.

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:39.640
No, not that.

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.190
It's kinda shameful, and I
don't do it all the time,

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.730
but there've been times
I've drunk so much

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:45.270
that I forgot stuff!

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.700
Who knows how well it'll
work with our history,

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.620
but if I get sauced enough,
I'll have a reason to go home

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.750
either way, sand then
we'll be in the clear!

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.320
[FUJIO]
That does make sense.

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:58.210
If this goes as planned,
we can entertain Hana,

00:17:58.290 --> 00:17:59.630
protect our secret,

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.950
and have a reasonable
excuse to end the party.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.630
And if all goes well,
you'll manage

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:05.750
to forget about tonight, too.

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:10.050
Yes! That's killing at least
three birds with one stone!

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:11.550
Time for Plan B.

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.050
Drink all the booze
in the house,

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.630
and if there's not enough,
then I'll run out and buy more.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.510
Start knockin' 'em back,
soldier!

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.230
[SAKURAI]
Yes, sir!

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:21.190
[FUJIO]
Actually, on second thought,

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:23.770
why's this chump in such
a hurry to black out?

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:25.640
What's his deal anyway?

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.690
Does he really not see Hana
as anything more than a friend?

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.450
What're you doing
all the way over there?

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:32.120
Come hang out on the couch!

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.330
[FUJIO]
He better not be leaving

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:35.370
my honey muffin
on the back burner.

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:38.410
[NARRATOR]
An hour later, he was drunk.

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:40.910
[SAKURAI sighs]

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Dang Sakurai, if I
didn't know any better,

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.250
I'd say you were sloshed.

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:45.750
Not to chase you out
of the house,

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.540
but we should probably call
it a night, don't you think?

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:48.800
Huh?

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.920
[YANAGI] There's that
constipated look again.

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:53.100
Is he still plotting something?

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:54.960
Wait, you wanna see
something funny?

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:56.180
[FUJIO]
Uh...

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.300
Whenever he's plastered,
he'll say anything.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.480
Usually when I try this,
he fights me off

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:01.850
and runs like the wind,
but right now

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:03.600
he's utterly defenseless.

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:06.860
--Look-it dem squishy cheeks!
--Ma cheeks.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.110
[FUJIO] Uh... Could you
cut that out, sweetie?

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:10.530
You must be pretty
buzzed yourself

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:12.450
since you're getting so
touchy-feely with him!

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:14.820
I'll make sure to say this again
when you're sober later,

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.650
but would you promise
Daddy that you'll

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.320
stay away from
those college ragers?

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:20.160
No one says ragers, Dad.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.780
How you feelin'? Did you
enjoy tonight's dinner?

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:26.290
It was delicious.
Super yummy like always.

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.540
You're wasted, but I'll take it.

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.800
[TSUKI]
My goodness, how interesting.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.090
Hana's playful side really
comes out when she's had a few.

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:36.710
Wowzers Sakurai, are you
always this loosey-goosey

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:37.970
after you slam some back?

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:40.760
I'm good. That's enough for me.

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:43.480
Well, gimme a second,
might have a second wind.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.440
Okay, now I'm a bit concerned.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.860
[FUJIO]
What a light weight.

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.110
He's completely put himself
out of commission.

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:51.400
It's all going
according to plan!

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:55.280
He's gone into auto-reply mode
just like an AI assistant.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.360
Hey, Mom, you should try
asking him something.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:01.370
Sure, okay. Long as that's
okay with Sakurai.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:02.830
[SAKURAI grunts]

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.910
Firstly, I want to thank
you for always keeping

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.420
my daughter company.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.040
Would you mind if I ask you
to keep looking out for her?

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:11.010
Yeah, of course.

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:14.890
To be honest, Hana can be a
pain in the neck sometimes.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.250
But right when you need her,
she comes through.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.430
And she's an
incredible chef, too.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:21.890
Though she can be a pain
in the neck sometimes.

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:23.680
[YANAGI]
So true he said it twice.

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:26.650
I'm not very good with words,
but you should know

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:28.690
that I'm grateful
for everything.

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:29.980
[UZAKI laughs]

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:31.600
[TSUKI]
That is one smug mug!

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.400
[YANAGI]
Did she seriously just use Mom

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.860
to fish for compliments.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.440
Aw, you only say stuff
like that when you're tipsy.

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:39.410
It's nice to hear it though,
so we gotta figure out

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:41.740
how to get you to be mushy
like this every day!

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:44.790
[FUJIO] Yes, give into
bliss of the booze.

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:47.290
Let go of those memories
and be free!

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:49.080
The only reason I
don't say that stuff

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:51.050
is 'cause I'm self-conscious.

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:53.630
But no matter what,
I'm grateful for you,

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:55.420
and I really mean that.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:57.260
[UZAKI squeals]

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.930
[TSUKI laughs]

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:00.970
[YANAGI laughs]
This conversation's starting

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:02.720
to take a romantic turn!

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.050
'Cause you know, I think
my parents confused me.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.020
Huh?

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.020
Especially my old man.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.100
Him and my mom used
to be all affectionate

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:13.280
with each other in front of me.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.150
Nothing wrong with that,
but I've always hated

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:17.520
that sorta thing
since I was a kid.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:18.650
[TSUKI, FUJIO grunt]

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.120
[SAKURAI]
And since I grew up trying

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.160
to avoid turning into Dad,
it means showing my feelings

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.080
feels like pulling teeth.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.200
I guess I can't blame you
for always wanting

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:29.710
to poke fun at that part of me.

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:33.710
But I don't know, lately I find
myself looking forward to it.

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:37.340
You getting up in my business
and screaming my ear off.

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.960
You do?

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:41.090
When I went to see my folks,

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:44.480
my old man told me something
that really shook me.

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:47.970
He said that if I didn't hurry
up and do things right by you,

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.270
it could cause you trouble.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:53.020
So that's what I've been
thinking about lately.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.060
Just giving you some
proper consideration.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:00.410
Sakurai...

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:04.990
[FUJIO sobs]
He loves her!

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.500
[NARRATOR] It took everything
the man had to grit his teeth

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.580
and keep himself
from shouting out loud.

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.290
[FUJIO]
No! He's in love with her!
