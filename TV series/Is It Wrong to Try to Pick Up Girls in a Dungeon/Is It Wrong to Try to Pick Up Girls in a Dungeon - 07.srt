00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,000
[FREYA]
That boy just keeps getting
stronger and stronger.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,166
He shines even more
brightly than before.

3
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:14,066
However, there's a reluctance
that's been holding him back.

4
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:20,466
But if his strength continues
to increase, that reluctance...

5
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:22,600
Will end...

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,300
I shall leave it
to you, Ottarl.

7
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,433
(Opening Song)

8
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,766
Hm?

9
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:11,300
(Laughs)

10
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:13,066
Oh! Aha!

11
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,700
Master Bell!

12
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,633
Oh! Oops, I forgot!

13
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:19,066
Hm?

14
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:22,000
(Giddy laugh)

15
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,666
[BELL]
It's just so cool.

16
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:24,933
You never told me...

17
00:02:25,033 --> 00:02:26,800
that you could do
transformation magic.

18
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,700
Yeah!
Pretty neat, right?

19
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,000
And as long as people
don't find out about it,

20
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,366
no one will be able
to recognize me.

21
00:02:33,466 --> 00:02:35,600
So if I just lay low
for a few days,

22
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,600
they'll have to assume
I died back in the dungeon.

23
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,766
Good point.

24
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:41,400
But are you really
sure this is okay?

25
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,266
Oh yeah.
I'll be happy as long
as YOU know it's me.

26
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:47,933
'Cause I don't really
have anyone else.

27
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:49,400
But anyway...

28
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,166
Are you sure YOU'RE okay
with ME and everything?

29
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:53,300
Huh?

30
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,300
I tricked you.
And I took advantage of you.

31
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,133
I mean after you treated
me so nice and everything,
Master Bell.

32
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:03,633
[LILI]
If you can't forgive me,
I understand...

33
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:05,100
(Chuckle)

34
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,566
Everything's okay.

35
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:07,866
Let's just go!

36
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:09,000
Huh?

37
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,566
Hmm...

38
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,566
[LILI]
Hello, I'm Liliruca Arde.

39
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:20,100
So I guess you're the one
I've heard so much about.

40
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,533
[HESTIA]
Bell already fill me in
on the entire story.

41
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:25,366
[BELL]
Okay then... I'll be
downstairs making some tea.

42
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:28,100
Oh wait, I forgot we only
have two teacups, don't we?

43
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,566
Ooh, that won't be
a problem, darling!

44
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,233
You know I'd be perfectly happy
to share a teacup with you!

45
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:36,566
Nah, it's fine, I can just
use a bowl or something.

46
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,366
Aww...

47
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:40,666
Now then...

48
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:41,766
Hm!

49
00:03:41,866 --> 00:03:42,966
There's something
very important

50
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:44,433
I want to ask you.

51
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:46,200
So tell me.

52
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,966
Do you swear that you will never
pull a stupid stunt like that

53
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:50,333
ever again?

54
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:52,333
Yes, I swear.

55
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:55,166
Master Bell...
and you too...

56
00:03:55,266 --> 00:03:57,400
you have my
undying allegiance.

57
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,000
You see...
he saved my life.

58
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,233
[LILI]
So I won't betray him.

59
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,166
No matter
what happens.

60
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:07,600
[HESTIA]
Okay, I'll take
you at your word.

61
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,333
(Sigh of relief)

62
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:12,300
I'm gonna be
honest with you.

63
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,266
You should know
I don't like you one bit.

64
00:04:15,366 --> 00:04:16,066
Huh?

65
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,700
[HESTIA]
Well why would I?

66
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,666
You played
Bell for a fool.

67
00:04:19,766 --> 00:04:21,600
And now you
are in my house!

68
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,133
You've sure got
a lot of nerve, Supporter.

69
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:26,066
And what's with that
mopey look you've had

70
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,200
ever since you walked in?

71
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,866
[HESTIA]
I bet you feel guilty

72
00:04:29,966 --> 00:04:31,800
because Bell's too nice
to blame you

73
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,933
for any of the rotten
stuff you've done.

74
00:04:34,033 --> 00:04:35,566
Is that it?

75
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,166
Bell is not stupid,

76
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:39,400
but he is definitely na ve.

77
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:42,166
Well whatever.

78
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:44,066
If Bell's not gonna hold
you responsible,

79
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,433
then I guess
I'll have to.

80
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:48,133
(Sad sigh)

81
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:51,000
Hmph.

82
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:57,833
I order you to
look out for Bell.

83
00:04:57,933 --> 00:04:59,200
Huh?

84
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,200
Make sure he doesn't
get taken in

85
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,766
by any more
swindlers like you.

86
00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:05,100
And listen up...

87
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,300
I am not doing
this for your sake.

88
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,866
But this whole ordeal
has made one thing clear.

89
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:12,200
If no one is watching him...

90
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,666
Ah, he's only gonna
fall for something else!

91
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:19,366
[HESTIA]
Besides, the only one who
can get rid of that guilt
you're feeling is you!

92
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:20,733
Nobody else!

93
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,933
(Hopeful laugh)
You might SAY you've
had a change of heart,

94
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:25,400
but I want you to prove it
with your actions!

95
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,266
Can you do that?

96
00:05:26,366 --> 00:05:28,233
Yes. I will, Goddess.

97
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,533
I'll allow you to
pair up with him.

98
00:05:30,633 --> 00:05:33,666
But you had better keep
an eye out... or else‐

99
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:34,966
[BELL]
Tea's ready!
Ah!

100
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:36,166
[HESTIA]
One more thing!

101
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:37,833
Don't you dare get
too close to him,

102
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:39,666
or I swear I'll
[LILI] Huh?!

103
00:05:39,766 --> 00:05:41,233
[BELL]
Sorry to make you
wait so‐ Guh!

104
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,666
[HESTIA]
Hi, Bell!
G‐Goddess Hestia?!

105
00:05:43,766 --> 00:05:45,800
(Stunned gasp)
[HESTIA]
Lili and I were just
having a little chat...

106
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,566
weren't we,
Miss Supporter?

107
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:51,533
And she says she'll take real
good care of you for me.

108
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:53,833
[HESTIA, INTERNAL]
Hm. But you don't think for a
minute

109
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:57,233
I'm gonna let you waltz in here
and steal him away from me!

110
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:01,166
You little homewrecker!
(Panicked screams)

111
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:03,400
(Determined grunt)

112
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,533
(Bell shrieks)

113
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:06,566
It will be
my pleasure!
(Shocked gasps)

114
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,833
I promise that I will make
extra sure Master Bell

115
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:12,333
has anything and everything
he could ever desire!

116
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:14,600
[LILI, THINKING]
I'll take out anyone who tries
to stand

117
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,366
between me and Master Bell,
even if it IS a Goddess!

118
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:20,333
I'm not gonna lose
to this floozy!

119
00:06:20,433 --> 00:06:24,033
(Both growling)
[BELL]
Uh, y‐yeah,
about that...

120
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,866
[BELL]
I forgot I have to
go see Miss Eina!

121
00:06:25,966 --> 00:06:27,600
Don't go!
Master Bell!

122
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:30,600
(Intense grunts)

123
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,400
[HESTIA]
You just scared him away,
you little shrimp!

124
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,233
[LILI]
What? Me?! You were the
one rubbing all over him!

125
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,600
[BELL, THINKING]
That was... awkward.
(Chuckle)

126
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,866
[HESTIA] Bell!
[LILI] Master Bell, come back!

127
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:41,233
(Street noise)

128
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:45,133
[BELL]
Wait, uh....
where is she?

129
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:46,800
[EINA]
Bell?
Huh?

130
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,766
Hm?

131
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:50,633
Huh?!

132
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,733
(Panicked gasp)

133
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,600
[EINA]
Bell! Wait!

134
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,466
AH!

135
00:06:58,566 --> 00:07:00,333
Oh, hey,
look out.

136
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:02,266
[BELL]
I am so sorry‐ Mmf!

137
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:04,066
[BELL]
Hm?
[BARBARIAN] Oh!

138
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,533
Hello,
Sword Princess.

139
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,666
AAHHHH!

140
00:07:06,766 --> 00:07:08,800
Bell, what the heck has
gotten into you?!

141
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,100
(Bell whimpering)
It's not very nice of you
to just run away.

142
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,766
I'm sorry... but I...
Why is she...?

143
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,600
just WHY?! GUH!

144
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,466
[EINA]
Um, Lady Wallenstein would
like to speak with you, Bell.

145
00:07:19,566 --> 00:07:22,666
A‐ah...

146
00:07:26,766 --> 00:07:31,166
[AIS]
Recently, you were attacked by
several orcs, am I right?

147
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:33,866
[BELL]
Uh, yes, ma'am.
How did you know that?

148
00:07:33,966 --> 00:07:37,233
From this. I think
you must've dropped it
during the fight...

149
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,900
So I, uh,
picked it up.

150
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,333
Oh!

151
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,233
You mean, you're the
one who saved me?

152
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,300
Again?

153
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,566
I would like
to apologize.

154
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,000
Huh?

155
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,300
If I hadn't allowed that
minotaur to escape,

156
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,600
you would never have been
injured that day.

157
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,566
So I'm very sorry.

158
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:57,466
Hng!

159
00:07:57,566 --> 00:07:58,666
No, you shouldn't be!

160
00:07:58,766 --> 00:08:01,900
It's not like you did
anything wrong, Miss Ais!

161
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,633
I owe you my life
for helping me get out!

162
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:07,366
And if anything, I should be
the one apologizing to you

163
00:08:07,466 --> 00:08:10,366
since I kept on running away
from you so many times!

164
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:12,466
Forgive me!

165
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,466
(Awkward sigh)
Huh?

166
00:08:17,566 --> 00:08:19,200
(Laugh)

167
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,733
Huh?

168
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,633
(Laughs)

169
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,766
Hm.

170
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:29,633
[AIS]
Seems like you've been
working extremely hard.

171
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:30,733
[BELL]
Huh?

172
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:31,933
You got all the way down

173
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:33,733
to Floor 10 in
a very short time.

174
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:34,966
That's really great.

175
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:37,133
Oh, no! You've got
the wrong idea!

176
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:39,866
I'm nowhere near as strong
as I need to be...

177
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:41,166
that's for sure.

178
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:43,333
And I don't have all the
best fighting skill.

179
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:45,133
Actually, I'm not
even sure

180
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,033
what my real
objective is either.

181
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:48,966
You see,
I'm not great.

182
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:51,066
I'm just a...
a failure...

183
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:54,933
Nobody's ever taught you how
to truly fight, have they?

184
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,733
[BELL]
No...

185
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:01,400
[AIS]
Well...

186
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,400
then what would you say
to letting me teach you?

187
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,466
Huh?!

188
00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:07,200
(Boink boink)

189
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:16,566
[BELL]
Thank you for your help,
Lady Wallenstein.

190
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,700
It's Ais.

191
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,866
[BELL]
What?

192
00:09:18,966 --> 00:09:20,433
Just Ais is fine.

193
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:22,866
That's what everyone else
calls me anyway.

194
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:23,833
Alright?

195
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:25,666
Ah! Uh, whatever
you say!

196
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:28,500
So... M‐Miss... Miss Ais...

197
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,166
[BELL]
Um... What kind of
training do you think

198
00:09:31,266 --> 00:09:33,000
I need to work on first?

199
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,200
That's a pretty
good question.

200
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:35,933
Huh?

201
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,366
I've thought about it...

202
00:09:37,466 --> 00:09:39,700
but I'm not sure I know
exactly what's best for you.

203
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,200
Huh?

204
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,433
[AIS]
I take it that knife is
your main weapon, right?

205
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:45,666
Do you know any
martial arts at all?

206
00:09:45,766 --> 00:09:47,466
N‐not really.

207
00:09:47,566 --> 00:09:49,600
May I take a look?

208
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:53,433
Mm...

209
00:09:55,866 --> 00:09:56,833
'Kay, watch.

210
00:09:56,933 --> 00:09:58,666
One... two...

211
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:02,700
[BELL]
Oh, uh. You really know
what you're doing.

212
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,266
I'm sorry, but...

213
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:06,033
do you think maybe you could
show me how you did that

214
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:07,100
one more time?

215
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,766
Errghh...!

216
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:10,766
Ah! Ngh!

217
00:10:10,866 --> 00:10:11,866
(Cough)

218
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:14,066
Oh! Huh...

219
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,666
[BELL, THINKING]
Yep, there it is.

220
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:18,633
She's a natural alright.

221
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:19,600
Gah!

222
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:23,966
Ngh...

223
00:10:24,066 --> 00:10:25,100
Sorry.

224
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,600
No... I'm fine.

225
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,700
It wasn't your fault,
I should've paid more‐

226
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,500
(Cough, cough)

227
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,333
(Sigh)

228
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,766
Now show me
what you've got.

229
00:10:35,866 --> 00:10:36,833
Huh?

230
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:37,633
(Shing)

231
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:39,466
Ngh! HUH?!

232
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:42,733
Eh?

233
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:43,733
Hm.

234
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,866
Huh? Gah...

235
00:10:45,966 --> 00:10:47,766
[AIS]
Just as I expected.

236
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:48,933
Huh?

237
00:10:49,033 --> 00:10:50,966
That was purely
a reflex just now.

238
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:53,033
You will need
to be in tune

239
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:55,033
with everything that
happens in battle.

240
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:56,433
If you can do that,

241
00:10:56,533 --> 00:10:58,400
then you'll learn how to
fight with your reflexes.

242
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,566
(Nervous gasp)

243
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,400
You feel afraid,
don't you?

244
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:03,966
Huh?

245
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:05,033
But I believe

246
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:06,666
that fear is
important, though.

247
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,733
It keeps you clear
and on‐guard.

248
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,333
[AIS]
But there's...

249
00:11:10,433 --> 00:11:12,633
there's something else
you fear, isn't there?

250
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:13,700
(Minotaur snarl)
(Bell gasps)

00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,900
Hm...

253
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,333
(Determined breath)

254
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:21,600
Yah‐ Gah!

255
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,900
[AIS]
Don't lose focus.

256
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,033
Don't allow for any
blind spots.

257
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:26,600
Now... stay alert!

258
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,633
GUH!

NGH!

00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,700
Gah! Hyah!

AHH!

(Pained grunts)

267
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:42,633
Combine skill and strategy.

268
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:45,566
Right now, you're lacking a
little something in both.

269
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:47,933
[AIS]
Can you stand?

270
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:51,366
Yeah...
One more try.

271
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,300

Hah...

GOH!

00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:05,433
(Weak grunts)

276
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:06,766
Hm?

(Monster snarls
and cries in agony)

I'm not sure.

00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,477
I doubt this will
satisfy her demands.

281
00:12:27,577 --> 00:12:29,177
It's not gonna be enough.

Hm?

00:12:40,477 --> 00:12:41,911
Hmph.

285
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,477
It looks like you've got
some backbone...

286
00:12:44,577 --> 00:12:45,644
Perfect.

287
00:12:45,744 --> 00:12:47,844
(Angry roar)

288
00:12:50,977 --> 00:12:53,744
Very impressive.
I think you'll do fine.

00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:04,344
You think you can
handle that?

(Low growl)

293
00:13:09,977 --> 00:13:10,644
Hehe.

Uh... Huh?

297
00:13:17,611 --> 00:13:18,811
So Master Bell?

298
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:21,077
How far are we
going this time?

299
00:13:21,177 --> 00:13:22,044
Not sure.

300
00:13:22,144 --> 00:13:24,411
Since we're taking
tomorrow off,

301
00:13:24,511 --> 00:13:26,244
why don't we get
as far as we can today?

302
00:13:26,344 --> 00:13:29,311
Thanks so much for
doing this for me.

It's not that big a deal.

304
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:32,777
We need to find you
a room, right?

305
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:35,944
Besides, I could use
the practice honestly.

306
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:38,911
By the way...

307
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:40,377
we haven't fought
anything yet,

Hm?
so why do you look
like you got beat up?

00:13:43,744 --> 00:13:45,511
Well... That's
'cause I did.

Yes.
