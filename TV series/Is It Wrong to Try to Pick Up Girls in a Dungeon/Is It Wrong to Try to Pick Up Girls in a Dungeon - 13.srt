What is this?

00:00:06,566 --> 00:00:09,566
[HERMES]
The dungeon wants
to express its revulsion.

3
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:12,966
...so it has chosen
to trap us all inside.

4
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:14,433
Makes me wonder.

5
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:17,366
So what about your
prayer, Uranus?

6
00:00:17,466 --> 00:00:20,033
This was never supposed to
be part of the agreement.

Just as I thought.

Come on,
we gotta help!
No, don't.

23
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:49,233
Are you sure you would
be doing them any good?

24
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,800

Think about it.

I'm not sure about
your skills as a leader.

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,100
But, that doesn't
make you wrong.

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,900
Chigusa, you protect
the Goddess.

at a time like this?!

331
00:16:59,782 --> 00:17:03,515
[RYU] This mortal begs for
divine protection."
[MIKOTO] That thing's huge.

332
00:17:03,615 --> 00:17:05,115
Hmm.

333
00:17:08,382 --> 00:17:12,015
"Almighty god of the art of
combat, grant me your guidance!

334
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:18,082
I ask you to bestow
your sublime power
upon this humble form!"

335
00:17:18,182 --> 00:17:19,182
Hah!

336
00:17:20,715 --> 00:17:22,682
[WELF, THINKING]
I know this is selfish of me,

337
00:17:22,782 --> 00:17:24,782
but there's somebody
I want to save!

338
00:17:24,882 --> 00:17:28,215
Please give me the
strength to do this!

339
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:30,015
HYAH!

340
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:34,849
[RYU]
"Vagabond winds, come forth.
Across the empty wilderness."

341
00:17:34,949 --> 00:17:38,482
[ASFI]
I suppose I'd better pull out
all the stops as well.

342
00:17:38,582 --> 00:17:40,915
(Electric crackling)

343
00:17:43,415 --> 00:17:44,182
Hyah!

344
00:17:44,282 --> 00:17:47,149
(Pained roar)

345
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:50,782
[RYU]
"Fill me with the
light of the stars...

346
00:17:50,882 --> 00:17:52,415
...and strike!"

347
00:17:53,315 --> 00:17:55,182
LUMINOUS WIND!

00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:59,115
(Roaring)

349
00:18:00,315 --> 00:18:01,515
[ASFI]
AHH!

350
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:03,782
[RYU]
AAHHH!

351
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:06,615
[MIKOTO]
"Descend from Heaven
and possess the earth!"

352
00:18:06,715 --> 00:18:08,482
Jinmu Tousei!

353
00:18:08,582 --> 00:18:09,449
Ah!

354
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:11,649
[MIKOTO]
Futsu‐no‐Mitama!

355

(Growling)

358
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:26,249
It's a seal...

359
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:32,049
(Angry growling)

360
00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:34,849
(Mikoto grunting)

361
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:36,482
I can't hold on...!

362
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,015
AH!

363
00:18:40,782 --> 00:18:43,649
[WELF]
Outta my way!

364
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:45,982
Kazuki!

365
00:18:46,082 --> 00:18:46,649
Nhg!

366
00:18:46,749 --> 00:18:50,382
(Long roar)

367
00:18:50,482 --> 00:18:53,682
[RYU]
That's a Crozzo magic sword!

368
00:18:53,782 --> 00:18:57,782
Kazuki... it surpasses
the originals!

369
00:18:59,615 --> 00:19:01,849
[HEPHAISTOS, FLASHBACK]
Please, don't make
your companions

370
00:19:01,949 --> 00:19:03,515
pay for your stubbornness.

371
00:19:03,615 --> 00:19:06,782
[WELF, THINKING]
She's right, I was just
being stubborn!

372
00:19:06,882 --> 00:19:09,149
(Cracking and shattering)

373
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,782
I'm sorry.

374
00:19:13,215 --> 00:19:17,249
(Low growl)

(Deep resonance)

376
00:19:24,515 --> 00:19:27,382
Ngh!

377
00:19:27,482 --> 00:19:30,549
[HESTIA, FLASHBACK]
Whenever you find yourself with
the odds all stacked against you

378
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:34,049
you can still be able to win
with the small bit of power
you have left.

379
00:19:34,149 --> 00:19:36,915
That's what we like
to call a Hero Shot.

380
00:19:37,015 --> 00:19:37,549
Ngh!

381

(Gasp)

388
00:20:06,382 --> 00:20:08,749
[RYU]
It's happening again.

389
00:20:09,449 --> 00:20:12,115
[WELF]
No, no, no, NO!

390
00:20:13,315 --> 00:20:15,849
[HESTIA, THINKING]
Our Bell is different now.

391
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,649
He's faster!

392
00:20:19,249 --> 00:20:20,815
And stronger!

393
00:20:22,515 --> 00:20:24,682
And he can leap
even higher!

394
00:20:24,782 --> 00:20:29,082
(Extended battlecry)

395
00:20:30,582 --> 00:20:31,849
NGH!

396
00:20:31,949 --> 00:20:35,415
(Shattering crystal)

397
00:20:39,482 --> 00:20:44,115
(Echoing boom)

398
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:56,515
(Wild cheering)

399
00:20:56,615 --> 00:21:00,949
Master Bell! You actually
defeated Goliath!

400
00:21:02,449 --> 00:21:04,215
(Amazed sigh)

401
00:21:05,582 --> 00:21:06,249
(Gasp)

402
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:07,515
(Weak laugh)

403
00:21:07,615 --> 00:21:09,315
[CHIGUSA]
Ouka!
(Crying)

404
00:21:09,415 --> 00:21:11,582
[MORD]
Not too bad...

405
00:21:11,682 --> 00:21:14,649
For a Little Rookie.

406
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:18,582
(Hermes laughs blissfully)

407
00:21:18,682 --> 00:21:20,615
[HERMES]
I did it. I saw it!

408
00:21:20,715 --> 00:21:22,915
I saw it with
my own eyes!

409
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:26,649
[HERMES]
Oh Zeus, you said
he had no potential!

410
00:21:26,749 --> 00:21:30,049
But your grandson truly
carries your blessing!

411
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:33,949
In fact, he's the Last Hero
bequeathed of your Familia!

412
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:37,049
I can feel the age
beginning to move forward!

413
00:21:37,149 --> 00:21:39,882
I'd hoped I'd be able
to witness this...

414
00:21:39,982 --> 00:21:42,149
Today, in the land of Orario,

415
00:21:42,249 --> 00:21:45,482
a new chapter
in our history begins!

416
00:21:45,582 --> 00:21:46,949
The future of these heroes,

417
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:49,615
through their lives
and beyond their deaths!

418
00:21:49,715 --> 00:21:52,349
It is an epic story
of family...

419
00:21:52,449 --> 00:21:54,549
woven by our children!

420
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:57,182
It's the Familia Myth!

421
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:59,415
(Ending Song)

422
00:22:26,515 --> 00:22:28,649
(Bar chatter)

423
00:22:33,282 --> 00:22:35,049
That was a hell of a shot!

424
00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:36,582
(Both chugging)

425
00:22:36,682 --> 00:22:38,115
[RIVERIA]
I think she's had enough.

426
00:22:38,215 --> 00:22:41,149
[TIONE]
Omigod. You had to
see it to believe it!

427
00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:45,949
(Take laughs)
[MIKOTO]
Drink, drink, drink!

428
00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:49,615
Thank you, Bell.

429
00:22:49,715 --> 00:22:51,215
(Choking)
(Girls growling)

430
00:22:51,315 --> 00:22:52,715
(Loki screaming)

431
00:22:52,815 --> 00:22:55,815
(All laugh)

432
00:23:26,715 --> 00:23:30,249
(Birds chirping)

433
00:23:43,782 --> 00:23:45,615
[HESTIA, THINKING]
You did it, Bell.

434
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:48,082
You did it.
