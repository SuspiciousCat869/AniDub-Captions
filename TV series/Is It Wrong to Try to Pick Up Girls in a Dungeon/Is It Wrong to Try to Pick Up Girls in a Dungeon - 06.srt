[LILI, VOICE‐OVER]
When I awoke... there I was.

2
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:10,033
Just me, completely alone.

3
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:11,666
(Bar chatter)

4
00:00:11,766 --> 00:00:15,133
My parents had gone into the
dungeon looking for money,

5
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:18,133
but they didn't survive
for long.

6
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:27,033
My entire life has been
one big struggle to survive.

7
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:29,433
(Gasping)

8
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:30,300
AH!

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,033
[MAN]
Hey!
(Lili whimpers)

10
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:33,566
[MAN]
You want me to dock your pay?!

11
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:37,333
Hurry it up! Let's go!

12
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:39,133
(Weak breath)

13
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:40,633
(Bar revelry)

14
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:43,166
[MAN]
Aw. Poor thing.

15
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:44,600
[MAN] Hyah!
[LILI] AH!

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,166
(Man laughs)
Agh...

17
00:00:47,266 --> 00:00:48,800
[MAN]
Just kiddin',
here ya go.

18
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,200
(Gasp)
(Man laughs)

19
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,566
[LILI, VOICE‐OVER]
I was constantly abused,

20
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,700
beaten, and ripped off...

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,500
(Quick footsteps)

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,966
Whenever I'd run away

23
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:01,866
or try to hide...
(Lili and clerks chuckle)

24
00:01:01,966 --> 00:01:05,633
Somehow, they always
found me.

25
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,133
(Maniacal laugh)

26
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,733
(Pained breathing)

27
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:10,566
Uh!

28
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:12,500
[LILI]
Ah!

29
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,866
(Gasp)

30
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:15,733
(Flower lady grunts)

31
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:19,033
[LILI, VOICE‐OVER]
I finally found a place
where I belonged,

32
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:22,133
and they took it away.

33
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,133
That's why
I hate adventurers.

34
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,500
I really... really... hate them

35
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,766
And I always will.

36
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,366
(Opening Song)

37
00:03:13,366 --> 00:03:16,566
(Flowing liquid)
(Giddy laughter)

38
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:19,633
MMmmm...

39
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:22,733
Ahahaha!

40
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,100
Oh man!

41
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,600
I haven't had Soma wine in,
like, FOREVER!

42
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,800
So now then, Goddess,

43
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,833
did I understand correctly that
the members of the Soma Familia

44
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:34,233
are worshipping wine
instead of the Gods?

45
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,666
[LOKI]
Uh‐huh. That's about the
gist of it, yeah.

46
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:38,966
And this stupidly
expensive cask...

47
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:40,633
is actually a
reject batch.

48
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:42,733
[LOKI]
So the one that
they worship,

49
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,033
is the finished masterpiece

50
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:46,066
you can't find on
the market anywhere.

51
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,600
Masterpiece?

52
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,733
Uh‐huh.

53
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,200
Now that stuff's
hardcore. Hehe.

54
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,533
One sip, and you're drunk
right down to your soul.

55
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:57,266
In fact, some people became
part of the Soma Familia

56
00:03:57,366 --> 00:03:58,900
just to get a
little taste of it.

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,866
[LOKI]
It's all about
el vino primo.

58
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:04,033
Really? That's it?
That's the only thing holding
the whole group together?

59
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:09,200
Exactly.
But in order to make wine,
you need to make money first.

60
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,733
So they offer a little sample

61
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,100
to the adventurers who
rake in the most cash.

62
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,733
[LOKI]
After they try it once,

63
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,500
it's easy to entice them
to work for one more sip.

64
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,000
(Gulp)
Hah...

65
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,866
[LOKI]
They get desperate
for more.

66
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:22,200
Enough to betray
their friends.

67
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,233
And even sacrifice
each other.

68
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,266
Uh...

69
00:04:27,366 --> 00:04:30,533
[LOKI]
Anyway, that's
all I know about it.

70
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:32,833
So does that help
you out, Eina baby?

71
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:35,900
[EINA]
Yes! Thank you!
Thank you, Goddess.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,300
[LOKI]
Hah!
Now come on, Ais!

73
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,233
[LOKI]
How long do you plan on
pouting over some dude

74
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,900
running away from you?

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,200
[LOKI]
Let's go update your Status,
shall we?

76
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,433
It'll do you some good.

77
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:49,166
Fine, if you say so.
(Loki giggles)

78
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:52,000
[LOKI]
And if you're lucky,
you might get a massage too.

79
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,866
[AIS]
If you try anything,
I WILL cut you.

80
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:56,500
[LOKI]
Aww, c'mon!

81
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,866
She's certainly is
an interesting one.

82
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,966
Goddess Loki can be
a bit eccentric...

83
00:05:03,066 --> 00:05:05,233
but she is quite clever...

84
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:08,466
and we have a great
deal of trust in her.

85
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:12,733
Hm...

86
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,833
Even sacrifice other
people... huh...

87
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:18,500
[LOKI]
You're at level 6 now?!

88
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,100
Pfffft!

89
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,100
(Thick bubbling)

90
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:27,466
(Bubbling and boiling)

91
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,466
(Sigh)

92
00:05:39,433 --> 00:05:43,733
[HESTIA]
So then... you're worried about
that supporter of yours?

93
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:46,133
That's right.

94
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:47,633
There's this adventurer
who's after Lili

95
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:49,700
and it looks like
he's pretty bad news.

96
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,966
[BELL]
I thought if we gave her
a place to hide for a bit...

97
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:53,900
maybe...

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,800
It's just that...

99
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,266
[BELL]
Yeah?

100
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:58,066
I hate to say this,
but, uh...

101
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,600
Are you sure that we can
trust this girl, Bell?

102
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,766
Huh?

103
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm sorry,

104
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,700
that wasn't the
nicest way to put it.

105
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,633
But judging by everything
you've told me so far,

106
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:10,200
there's something awfully
suspicious about her.

107
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,200
[HESTIA]
Think about it, Bell.

108
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,433
Did you really "drop"
the knife?

109
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:16,200
(Sigh)

110
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,066
And why would there be an
adventurer out to get her?

111
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,700
You see what
I mean, right?

112
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,533
She's hiding
something from you.

113
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,666
I, uh...

114
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,333
Hmm.

115
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,633
[BELL]
Thanks for looking
out for me...

116
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,633
(Street chatter)

117
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:40,366
[BELL]
Huh? Floor 10?

118
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:43,633
Yeah! I think you're good
enough to make it down there.

119
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:46,200
You're tough, so I'm sure
it'll be just fine.

120
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,033
But uh...
you had to save me.

121
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:51,233
You used your magic knife
back on floor 7,

122
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,500
don't you remember that?

123
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,933
Besides, once you get
that far down...

124
00:06:55,033 --> 00:06:57,300
(Boom)

125
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,666
...then you start to run
into the bigger monsters.

126
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:03,066
[LILI]
Yeah, but that's not gonna be a
problem for you, Master Bell!

127
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,500
'Cause now you've
got magic firepower!

128
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,700
(Nervous laugh)

129
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,400
Don't worry,
I know you can do it!

130
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,033
And I've been all
the way down to floor 11

131
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:12,766
so you can take
my word for it!

132
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:15,633
(Awkward sigh)

133
00:07:15,733 --> 00:07:17,100
(Gleeful laugh)

134
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:19,100
(Thud)

135
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,700
[EINA, THINKING]
I was planning
to have a talk

136
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,366
with Goddess Hestia
anyway, but...

137
00:07:23,466 --> 00:07:27,333
I had no idea it would be
during my inspection of Babel.

138
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:31,133
I guess I'll need to do it...
Mix business and pleasure.

139
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:34,200
But I absolutely must warn her
about Bell's supporter.

140
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,466
Huh?

141
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:37,733
Hm.

142
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,766
[LILI]
I wanna thank you for taking my
suggestion, Master Bell.

143
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:47,400
Becoming your supporter
really turned out to be

144
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,800
quite a stroke
of good luck for me.

145
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,166
[BELL]
Yeah, well...

146
00:07:51,266 --> 00:07:53,100
All that aside...

147
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,933
I had to come down
sometime.

148
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:57,133
[LILI]
Oh, and...
Hm?

149
00:07:57,233 --> 00:08:00,633
I hope you don't think it's
too forward of me, but...

150
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:02,633
(Sword unsheathing)

151
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:06,533
[LILI]
I suggest you try fighting
with this from here on out.

152
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:07,766
You think so?

153
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:09,033
[LILI]
Yeah.

154
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:10,500
The weapon you've been
using is gonna be

155
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,366
a little too short
for big monsters..

156
00:08:12,466 --> 00:08:14,933
So this baselard
should work better for you.

157
00:08:15,033 --> 00:08:16,066
[BELL]
Got it.

158
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,633
I'll borrow it Huh?

159
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:19,700
Hm.

160
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,566

Ah.

There. We're all set...
You ready to go?

You know it!

167
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:36,233
You're telling me that I saved
one of your adventurers?

00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,700
[EINA]
Yes. I'm so glad I got
a chance to thank you.

169
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,133
You see, he was about to be
killed by a minotaur on the
fifth floor,

170
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:45,066
but then, suddenly,
you came to the rescue.

[AIS]
A Minotaur?

I, uh... I hope I didn't
scare him, did I?

Uh, n‐no! No!

He's fine!

A‐actually, Mr. Cranel has
been exceedingly appreciative

of everything you did for him!

Is there
something wrong?

Okay, Your Ladyship.

Is this really
the tenth floor?

Hang on,

Yep. It's a Landform, but...

bigger problems right now.

Don't turn back now,

You're absolutely right, Lili.
If I can't defeat an orc,

This is very important.

[GEDO] Hng!
[LILI] Ahh!

321
00:14:52,729 --> 00:14:53,896
You even managed

322
00:14:53,996 --> 00:14:55,263
to grab a magic knife!

323
00:14:55,363 --> 00:14:57,329
[GARNEAU]
Gettin' ready to
take off, buddy?

324

Oh, back so soon?
You made some good time.

[GEDO]
You believe this worm?

327
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,863
She even got her hands
on a magic knife.

328
00:15:06,963 --> 00:15:08,829
You guys were right
all along. Ha!

329
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:11,563
She really has been piling
up the goods, hasn't she?

330
00:15:11,663 --> 00:15:15,696
[GARNEAU]
How 'bout that?
That reminds me.

331
00:15:15,796 --> 00:15:18,163
Think you can do me
one favor, Pal?

333

I'm gonna need

Huh?

AH!

(Monster screeches)

337
00:15:26,363 --> 00:15:27,863
AHH!

00:15:27,963 --> 00:15:29,696
What the hell, you idiot?!

339
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:31,863
[GEDO]
Do you have any idea
what you've done?!

340
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:34,596
[GARNEAU]
Yep. A wounded killer ant
always sends out

341
00:15:34,696 --> 00:15:36,763
(Ant screeches weakly)
a signal to its kind.

342
00:15:36,863 --> 00:15:39,429
[GARNEAU]
Any good adventurer
should know that.

343
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:40,563
Heh heh.

344
00:15:40,663 --> 00:15:42,029
(Gasp)
[GEDO]
Unbelievable.

345
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:44,696
Are you guys freakin' crazy?!

346
00:15:45,296 --> 00:15:46,863
[GARNEAU]
C'mon...

347
00:15:46,963 --> 00:15:48,329
You don't wanna end up dinner

348
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:51,729
because you were too busy
fightin' with us, now do ya?

349
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:52,763
(Ants screech)

Ah!

00:15:52,863 --> 00:15:54,396

Argh! You bastards!

[GEDO]
AHHHHH!
Eh?!

00:16:01,263 --> 00:16:02,829
Hah? Ah!

00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:06,596
(Ants screech)

357
00:16:06,696 --> 00:16:08,429
[GARNEAU]
Uh‐oh.

358
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:09,963
In trouble again, aren't ya?

359
00:16:10,063 --> 00:16:12,963
But we're all in
the same Familia.

360
00:16:13,063 --> 00:16:16,063
So just gimme what you got...
and you'll be free to go.

361
00:16:16,163 --> 00:16:16,963
Uh!

00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:17,796
Unless!

363
00:16:17,896 --> 00:16:19,229
You think you can cheat us

364
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:20,563
like you did yesterday.

365
00:16:20,663 --> 00:16:22,029
'Cuz if you do... Heh heh...

[LILI]
Okay, fine!

368
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:27,063
You can have it okay?

369
00:16:27,163 --> 00:16:27,929
Hm.

370
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,663
[GARNEAU]
That's a good girl.

371
00:16:31,963 --> 00:16:34,229
[LILI]
My gnome safe
deposit box...

372
00:16:34,329 --> 00:16:38,063
I traded the money for jewels
and locked them in there.

373
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,496
[GARNEAU]
So, that's
pretty clever!
AH!

374

Hahaha!

00:16:41,563 --> 00:16:43,529
[LILI]
Ah! Mr. Garneau...

376
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:46,163
Have yourself a
little look around.

377
00:16:46,263 --> 00:16:47,263
(Weak whimper)

(Ants chittering)

00:16:48,663 --> 00:16:50,496
[GARNEAU]
Not too pretty,
now is it?

00:16:50,596 --> 00:16:52,696
Ahahaha!

381
00:16:52,796 --> 00:16:55,129
You know...
you'd make good bait!

382
00:16:55,229 --> 00:16:55,996
NO!

383
00:16:56,096 --> 00:16:59,363
[GARNEAU]
Yeah... Hehehe.

384
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:01,463
But... but
you said‐

385
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:03,096
Recognize any
adventurers around here

contract with, kid?

Time you did somethin'
worthwhile.

(Ants screech)

392
00:17:18,129 --> 00:17:19,229
Yeah... well...

393
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:23,396
[LILI]
What else would I expect
from adventurers?

394
00:17:23,496 --> 00:17:25,996
I guess this is fair,
isn't it?

395
00:17:26,096 --> 00:17:31,396
I mean, it's what I get
for deceiving Master Bell.

396
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:34,096
But either way...

397
00:17:36,129 --> 00:17:38,963
I don't want to
just give up...

Please, Gods... tell me...

399
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:48,229
Tell me... why I was
made to be this way.

400
00:17:48,329 --> 00:17:52,663
I wish I didn't have to be
so tiny and so pathetic.

401
00:17:52,763 --> 00:17:57,696
But everything's always
been like that for me.

402
00:17:58,529 --> 00:17:59,863
[LILI, VOICE‐OVER]
I was so lonely.

403
00:17:59,963 --> 00:18:03,029
I just wanted to be
needed by someone.

404
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:06,563
But it's over now.

405
00:18:06,663 --> 00:18:09,729
I'm finally
going to die.

406
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:12,496
After a lifetime of
helplessness...

weakness...

00:18:14,196 --> 00:18:16,096
worthlessness...

and loneliness.

It's all coming to an end.

Master Bell...

How did you...
get back here?

441
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:41,050
Well, it was hard to see
through all that fog...

442
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:44,917
But it looked like another
adventurer showed up.

443

After that,
the orcs disappeared.

So I ran straight
for you.

I'm glad I made it
in time.

know WHY!

Why did you come back and save

Oh please, don't tell me
you didn't realize

00:20:03,383 --> 00:20:05,183
I was trying to
steal from you!

454
00:20:05,283 --> 00:20:08,083
I tricked you! I led you into
a trap and took your knife

455
00:20:08,183 --> 00:20:09,750
just so I could sell it
and make a little money!

[BELL]
Guh!

Huh?
I don't understand!

Are you stupid

Are you really
that blind?!

Look. Just calm
down, okay?

I can't!
Huh?

How did you not notice
any of it?!

I pocketed tons of money that
should have been going to you!

You were nice enough to offer it
50/50, but I split it 60/40!

00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,383
Sometimes I even made it 70/30!

And whenever you would
asked me for items...

I would always tell you
they cost double!

00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,917
because you're a girl.

479
00:20:59,017 --> 00:21:00,083
My God!
Uh!

480
00:21:00,183 --> 00:21:02,283
I can't believe
you'd say that!

481
00:21:02,383 --> 00:21:04,217
You're telling me
you would save anybody

482
00:21:04,317 --> 00:21:05,950
as long as they
were a girl?!

483
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,517
Now you're nothing
but a philanderer!

484
00:21:08,617 --> 00:21:09,883
A playboy!

485
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:12,350
Pervert! Creeper!

486
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,817
(Sobs)

487
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:17,717
[BELL]
Actually... it's 'cause
it was you.

488
00:21:17,817 --> 00:21:18,850
(Gasp)

489
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,650
Really.

490
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,950
That's why I
wanted to do it.

491
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,783
I only did it because
it was you, Lili.

492
00:21:25,883 --> 00:21:29,183
(Crying and sniffling)

493
00:21:29,283 --> 00:21:31,717
[BELL] I didn't
want to lose you.

494
00:21:31,817 --> 00:21:33,583
That's all
there is to it.

495
00:21:33,683 --> 00:21:35,317
You're reason enough.

496
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:37,083
(Sobbing)

497
00:21:37,183 --> 00:21:42,183
Lili, if you're ever in
trouble, just tell me.

498
00:21:42,283 --> 00:21:44,017
I never told you this...

499
00:21:44,117 --> 00:21:45,850
and I probably
already should have...

500
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,583
[BELL] ...but I will
always be here for you.

501
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:53,417
(Sobbing)

502
00:21:53,517 --> 00:21:54,583
Oh!

503
00:21:54,683 --> 00:21:56,217
Hm.

504
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,450
[BELL]
It's okay.

505
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,583
(Continued crying)

506
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,783
[BELL]
I'm sorry, Miss Eina.

507
00:22:16,883 --> 00:22:19,250
I didn't mean to make
you worry about me.

508
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,417
And I lost...
that protector.

509
00:22:22,517 --> 00:22:23,850
You mad at me?

510
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,517
No. Just as long
as you're safe.

511
00:22:28,183 --> 00:22:30,350
At any rate,
what's next?

512
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,150
Hm.

513
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,183
Mm...

514
00:22:44,683 --> 00:22:48,417
[BELL]
Excuse me,
Miss Supporter.
(Gasp)

515
00:22:48,517 --> 00:22:51,050
Are you looking
for an adventurer?

516
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:54,383
Huh? Uh.

517
00:22:54,483 --> 00:22:55,583
Huh?!

518
00:22:55,683 --> 00:22:57,617
You seem to be
a bit confused.

519
00:22:57,717 --> 00:23:00,017
But it isn't really all
that complicated, Miss.

520
00:23:00,117 --> 00:23:02,117
'Cause I'm just a
rookie adventurer

521
00:23:02,217 --> 00:23:04,050
who's looking to find
a supporter.

522
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,650
And I think that you
would make a great one.

523
00:23:07,383 --> 00:23:08,983
Master Bell...

524
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:13,683
[BELL]
Would you please go into the
dungeon with me again soon...

525
00:23:13,783 --> 00:23:15,950
Lili?

526
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,317
Sure... I'd love to!

527
00:23:33,917 --> 00:23:35,017
(Clang)

528
00:23:35,117 --> 00:23:38,683
I forgot to
apologize again.

529
00:23:39,383 --> 00:23:40,983
Oh?

530
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:43,017
[AIS]
Isn't that...?

531
00:23:44,383 --> 00:23:49,250
[HESTIA]
Next time:
"Ais Wallenwhatever"
