Huh?

162
00:08:15,793 --> 00:08:18,093
(Slow gasp)

163
00:08:18,693 --> 00:08:19,459
Huh?

164
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:20,426
Who's there?!

165
00:08:20,526 --> 00:08:21,526
(Boom)
Guh!

166
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,593
Hnng...

167
00:08:24,626 --> 00:08:27,459
[BELL]
I'M SORRY AGAIN!

168
00:08:29,393 --> 00:08:31,293
Oh, Mr. Cranel?

169
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:34,493
[RYU]
You're fine.

170
00:08:34,593 --> 00:08:36,493
I know exactly
what happened.

171
00:08:36,593 --> 00:08:38,526
There's no need for you
to worry about it, okay?

172
00:08:38,626 --> 00:08:40,859
What? You're letting
me off that easy?

173
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,293
But how do you know
I'm not lying to you?

174
00:08:43,393 --> 00:08:47,493
[RYU]
I realize modesty is a virtue
and everything, Mr. Cranel,

175
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:51,226
but I'd appreciate it
if you didn't grovel.

176
00:08:51,326 --> 00:08:53,693
It's an unflattering
habit of yours.

177
00:08:53,793 --> 00:08:56,526
Oh... Never
thought about that.

178
00:08:57,526 --> 00:08:58,959
Uh... h‐hold on.

179
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:01,226
[BELL]
I've been meaning to
tell you thanks for

180
00:09:01,326 --> 00:09:04,593
coming all the way down here
to rescue us, Miss Ryu.

181
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:06,826
It really does
mean a lot.

182
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:08,593
[RYU]
No, think nothing of it.

183
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:10,993
I was planning on coming
here again soon anyway.

184
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,793
You just gave me
a good excuse.

185
00:09:12,893 --> 00:09:13,759
Huh?

186
00:09:13,859 --> 00:09:15,993
Uh. Wha?

187
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:34,426
[RYU]
I like to come here every now
and then to bring flowers...

188
00:09:34,526 --> 00:09:37,659
So Mama Mia occassionaly
gives me some time off.

189
00:09:38,726 --> 00:09:40,526
So, uh... where are we?

190
00:09:40,626 --> 00:09:45,493
[RYU]
The grave of my comrades
from my original Familia.

191
00:09:45,593 --> 00:09:50,559
You see... we fell into a trap
that was set by an enemy
Familia.

192
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:52,693
I was the only one
who survived.

193
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:55,326
The rest... they were
all murdered.

194
00:09:55,426 --> 00:09:56,359
(Sigh)

195
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:57,959
Hmm.

196
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,393
I want to...
to tell you something.

197
00:10:05,493 --> 00:10:07,493
Huh? Sure.

198
00:10:08,426 --> 00:10:09,426
Since that day...

199
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,626
I have been blacklisted
by the guild.

200
00:10:11,726 --> 00:10:13,426
Huh?

201
00:10:13,526 --> 00:10:17,359
[RYU]
Because I killed every
last one of their members.

202
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:21,393
[RYU]
Sneak attacks,
booby traps, ambushes...

203
00:10:21,493 --> 00:10:24,159
No method of revenge
was beneath me.

204
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:26,459
I was driven
purely by rage.

205
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,493
And malice.

206
00:10:28,593 --> 00:10:32,726
[RYU]
Eventually, when my revenge
was complete...

207
00:10:32,826 --> 00:10:35,659
I found myself alone...

208
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,859
in a dark, empty alley,

209
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:41,059
drained of every last bit
of my strength.

210
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:43,526
I thought I was done.

211
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:47,126
A fitting end for me after
doing something so foolish.

212
00:10:47,226 --> 00:10:48,326
But...

213
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,159
Are you okay?

214
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:56,759
And that's when you went
to work at the tavern?

215
00:10:56,859 --> 00:10:59,159
Yes. They took me in...

216
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:02,659
even though they knew everything
about what I had done.

217
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:06,826
Sorry, I probably shouldn't
be bothering you with my
sob story like this.

218
00:11:06,926 --> 00:11:08,626
Uh! That's okay.

219
00:11:08,726 --> 00:11:10,926
[RYU]
So, in the long run...

220
00:11:11,026 --> 00:11:13,193
I'm nothing but a reckless,
bloodthirsty elf.

221
00:11:13,293 --> 00:11:17,493
I will only disappoint you
and break your trust.

222
00:11:18,493 --> 00:11:19,959
(Grimace)

223
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:23,093
[BELL]
Miss Ryu...
Hm.

224
00:11:23,193 --> 00:11:25,593
You really shouldn't put
yourself down like that.

225
00:11:25,693 --> 00:11:28,393
Don't do it... it's ugly.

226
00:11:29,893 --> 00:11:33,493
What was that? I don't
really know what to say.

227
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:35,826
Uh... let me
take that back!

228
00:11:35,926 --> 00:11:37,726
That was too harsh.

229
00:11:37,826 --> 00:11:41,626
You are a kind person,
Mr. Cranel.

230
00:11:47,093 --> 00:11:50,626
You are a Human worthy
of the utmost respect.

00:11:50,726 --> 00:11:53,226
(Gasp)

232
00:12:01,893 --> 00:12:07,359
(Crickets chirping)

233
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,259
[MORD]
AW! Dammit!

234
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:12,693
Aw c'mon, just give it
a rest already, Mord.

235
00:12:12,793 --> 00:12:14,493
[MORD]
Shut your face!
Hey!

236
00:12:14,593 --> 00:12:17,693
That punk bastard musta
used some kinda trick
to get this far.

Are ya jealous, bro?

00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:22,126
What?!

240
00:12:22,226 --> 00:12:24,326
You think it doesn't
affect you too?

241
00:12:24,426 --> 00:12:26,859
That little wuss made it all the
way down to the middle floors

242
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,659
as soon as he leveled up.

243
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:30,426
He's makin' a mockery
of guys like us.

We've been doing this
for years!
[MAN] Mm‐hmm.

245
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:36,226
We adventurers gotta
follow a certain code.

246
00:12:36,326 --> 00:12:39,026
And somebody'll have
to teach him that.

is get him alone...

a chance to see

00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:01,086
Eh?
I don't believe this!

00:13:01,186 --> 00:13:02,686

That is total bullshit!

[TIONA]
Ugh. Would you please
let it go already?

00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:07,452
(Bete screams)
[TIONE]
Lord Hermes made him do it,

258
00:13:07,552 --> 00:13:08,886
and he's getting
punished as we speak.

259
00:13:08,986 --> 00:13:11,286

Worth it!

Hey, stop it!
Put me down, you nasty freaks!

Ugh, will you shut up? You're
making a spectacle of yourself.

Uh!

You're leaving

266
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:28,452
Yes.
And it looks like I'll be
a part of the lead party.

267
00:13:28,552 --> 00:13:31,886
You've been assigned to join
the trailing party, I assume?

00:13:31,986 --> 00:13:33,886
Yeah.

269
00:13:33,986 --> 00:13:35,686
Um... so...

00:13:35,786 --> 00:13:37,752
be careful, okay?

00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:41,452
Hmm.. And you too.
Be careful.

What is wrong
with you, Bell?!

274

If you're want to
get peep at me,

00:13:50,252 --> 00:13:52,119
you should do it
when I'm all alone!

We didn't hurt your

Okay. So what is it
you want from me?

Sure. It's simple.

The winner can ask whatever
he wants from the loser.

If I win...

you have to hand over everything

you understand.
