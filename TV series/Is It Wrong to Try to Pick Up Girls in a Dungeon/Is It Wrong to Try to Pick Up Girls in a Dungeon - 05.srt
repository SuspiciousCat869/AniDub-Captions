00:00:04,366 --> 00:00:07,833
[HESTIA]
Agh! Can you
believe that, Miach?!

3
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:10,233
All this time...
my Bell was...

4
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:13,733
He was cheating on me!
(Crunch crunch)

5
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:16,500
(Crunch crunch)
What's wrong
with him, dammit?!

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,000
(Crunch crunch)
He belongs to ME!

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,566
Oh come on now,
Hestia.

8
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:22,800
The boy doesn't
"belong" to anyone.

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,533
Hmph! Oh don't you
think I know that?

10
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:27,333
It's just an expression!

11
00:00:27,433 --> 00:00:28,233
Gah!

12
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,766
He just doesn't
get it! UGH!

13
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:31,766
Argh!

14
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:32,866
Hmph!

(Monstrous burp)

16
00:00:37,866 --> 00:00:39,500
Why?! Tell me!

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm begging you not
to leave me, Bell,

18
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,266
I'll do anything!

19
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:46,833
Please not so loud.
You're making a scene.

20
00:00:46,933 --> 00:00:47,966
I love you, Bell...

21
00:00:48,066 --> 00:00:51,066
(Loud sobbing)
I LOVE YOU!

22
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,433

(Hestia screams
and cries loudly)

24
00:02:29,922 --> 00:02:32,122

Ugghhhh...

25
00:02:32,222 --> 00:02:33,022
AH!

27
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:37,055
[BELL]
Um are you okay,
Goddess Hestia?

28
00:02:37,155 --> 00:02:39,155
Uh!
(Loud gulping)

29
00:02:39,255 --> 00:02:40,455
Uh... Um...

30
00:02:40,555 --> 00:02:42,655
Hmph.
Is something
wrong?

31
00:02:42,755 --> 00:02:43,822
You're acting
kinda weird.

32
00:02:43,922 --> 00:02:47,389
[HESTIA]
Hmph. I'm fine.

33
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:48,889
[HESTIA, THINKING]
Whatever...

34
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:51,722
Who cares what you think,
dirty cheater...

35
00:02:51,822 --> 00:02:54,022
Hm?
Oh, uh, Goddess?

36
00:02:54,122 --> 00:02:56,089
This might be
a bad time,

37
00:02:56,189 --> 00:02:58,789
but when's the next day
you have time off?

38
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:00,655
Time off?
What d'ya mean?

39
00:03:00,755 --> 00:03:02,189
Well, it's just that, uh...

40
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:04,722
I've been making a lot of money
in the dungeon recently...

41
00:03:04,822 --> 00:03:06,855
and I want to repay you for
everything you've done for me.

42
00:03:06,955 --> 00:03:11,089
[BELL]
Would you maybe want to go out
for a fancy dinner sometime?

43
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:13,122
Just the two of us?

44
00:03:13,222 --> 00:03:14,955
Like... a date?!

45
00:03:15,055 --> 00:03:16,722
How's today?
[BELL] Huh?

46
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:17,955
Yeah, today!

47
00:03:18,055 --> 00:03:18,989
[BELL]
Whoa, hold on...

48
00:03:19,089 --> 00:03:20,455
WE'RE GOING TODAY!

49
00:03:20,555 --> 00:03:22,289
I thought you
were sick.

50
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:24,255
Nope! All better!
Huh?

51

(Giggling)

52
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,222
Oh!
(Sniffing)

53
00:03:27,322 --> 00:03:29,722
'Kay Bell!
Meet me at 6 o'clock sharp

54
00:03:29,822 --> 00:03:33,422
tonight in the southwest
Main Street Amour Plaza, okay?

55
00:03:33,522 --> 00:03:34,255
(Laughs)

(Viscous bubbling)

57
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:42,155
[HESTIA]
I got a date with Bell...

58
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,122
And I don't wanna smell...

59
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:45,455
(Chuckles)

60
00:03:45,555 --> 00:03:47,322
[DEMETER]
Hello, Hestia.
Huh?

61
00:03:47,422 --> 00:03:49,555
[DEMETER]
Fancy seeing
you here.

62
00:03:49,655 --> 00:03:50,722
(giggle)

63
00:03:50,822 --> 00:03:52,522
[HESTIA]
Demeter!
Long time no see!

64
00:03:52,622 --> 00:03:53,522
Ah. Oh!

65
00:03:53,622 --> 00:03:55,222
[DEMETER]
Well aren't you looking

66
00:03:55,322 --> 00:03:56,755
just as busty as ever?

67
00:03:56,855 --> 00:03:57,622
Oh!

68
00:03:57,722 --> 00:03:58,622
Oh. Uh, yeah, well,

69
00:03:58,722 --> 00:04:00,055
you sure are one to talk.

70
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:01,689
Don't see you here
very often.

71
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:03,789
I assume there must be some
sort of special occasion

72
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:06,289
to bring YOU out to visit
the temple baths.

73
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:09,922
Mhm! I've got a little
rendezvous in town tonight.

74
00:04:10,022 --> 00:04:11,755
So I want to
look my very best.

75
00:04:11,855 --> 00:04:13,022
Ah! You wha‐?!

76
00:04:13,122 --> 00:04:15,155
You positively
must tell me!

77
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,789
I most certainly
do not.

78
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,689
Oh! This is too good!

79
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:20,055
I can't believe it!

80
00:04:20,155 --> 00:04:21,622
D'you hear
that, ladies?!
Ah!

81
00:04:21,722 --> 00:04:23,655
[GODDESS 1]
Hestia got
herself a man?!

82
00:04:23,755 --> 00:04:26,055
[GODDESS 2]
The same Hestia that couldn't
get a guy in Heaven?

83
00:04:26,155 --> 00:04:27,622
[GODDESS 3]
You mean the shorty
with the big boobs?!

84
00:04:27,722 --> 00:04:29,622
[GODDESS 1]
Like, tell us
who it is!
Uh!

[GODDESSES]
Yeah, spill!

86

Hm...

87
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:35,489
Okay, so he is a member
of my Familia.

88
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:36,655
He's a human.

89
00:04:36,755 --> 00:04:37,822
[ALL]
Ooooohh!

[HESTIA]
Hey, shut your
nosey traps!

I'm so done
with you guys!

93

[GODDESS 1]
Ooh la la!

94
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:46,622
So do tell me,
Hestia.

95
00:04:46,722 --> 00:04:49,322
[DEMETER]
What's so special about
this boy anyway?
Hm?

96
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:52,055
Oh, everything!

I'm so sorry...

105
00:05:10,322 --> 00:05:12,622
Um...did I keep
you waiting?

106
00:05:12,722 --> 00:05:14,122
No! Not at all!

107
00:05:14,222 --> 00:05:16,622
I actually only got here
just a minute ago.

Ooh, is that him?

110

couldn't resist.
[HESTIA] UH!

00:05:34,522 --> 00:05:37,489
I'm so sorry...
but this is all too much.

Let go...!

00:05:40,255 --> 00:05:41,289
OH!

121

Well, isn't he
simply adorable?!
Mff... Mff!

122

(Demeter laughs)
(Muffled screaming)

124
00:05:46,255 --> 00:05:49,489
Get your... boobs...
off of him!

125
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:51,022
Oh? Ah?

126
00:05:51,122 --> 00:05:53,422
[HESTIA]
AHWHAAA!

127
00:05:53,522 --> 00:05:56,255
[GODDESS 4]
She's taking him away!

Get back here!

Hm?
Hm?

I think they went
that way!

Oh god... Looks like
we finally lost 'em.

138
00:06:24,555 --> 00:06:27,022
[HESTIA]
The other goddesses
always act like that!

139
00:06:27,122 --> 00:06:29,389
Ya bunch of
drooling hyenas!

140
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:32,855
They kept us running
around the whole day!

141
00:06:32,955 --> 00:06:35,322
So much for
our date, huh?

142
00:06:35,422 --> 00:06:37,755
Ah... I dunno, it was
still pretty fun.

143
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:38,722
Huh?

144
00:06:38,822 --> 00:06:40,155
Just look out there.

145
00:06:40,255 --> 00:06:43,189
It's not all
that bad, is it?

146
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,389
[HESTIA]
Huh...

147
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:50,255
(Hestia laughs)

It's beautiful.

Mhm.

151
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:58,289
Hey, Goddess,
let's do this again.

152
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:00,689
But next time we might
wanna get dinner first.

153
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:01,489
(Laughs)

154
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:03,255
[HESTIA]
Yeah.

155
00:07:04,355 --> 00:07:05,522
Hm.

156
00:07:07,489 --> 00:07:11,489
[HESTIA]
I'll be looking
forward to it, Bell.

157
00:07:16,122 --> 00:07:17,522
(Scared gasp)

158
00:07:17,622 --> 00:07:19,889
[GARNEAU]
Ooh, that for me?
Ah!

159
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:24,789
So then, you say you
got more than usual.
(Coins jingle)

160
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:27,955
Well sorry, but it still ain't
quite enough though, is it?

161
00:07:28,055 --> 00:07:28,989

00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,955
when you first gain
a magic ability...

323
00:13:45,055 --> 00:13:47,622
a spell will appear
with your Status.

324
00:13:47,722 --> 00:13:49,322
However, somehow...

325
00:13:49,422 --> 00:13:51,655
your Status isn't
telling me anything...

326
00:13:51,755 --> 00:13:53,422
'cept for
"Quick Attack Magic."

327
00:13:53,522 --> 00:13:54,755
Yeah?

328
00:13:54,855 --> 00:13:56,555
I'm just guessing here,

329
00:13:56,655 --> 00:13:59,955
but I think that might
mean your magic doesn't
require a spell after all.

330
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:01,122
Huh?!

331
00:14:01,222 --> 00:14:03,455
Well, you should
probably test it out

332
00:14:03,555 --> 00:14:05,855
when you go down to the
dungeon tomorrow.

333
00:14:05,955 --> 00:14:06,855
Tomorrow?

334
00:14:06,955 --> 00:14:08,322
Don't you worry.

335
00:14:08,422 --> 00:14:10,655
It's your magic.
It's not going anywhere.

336
00:14:10,755 --> 00:14:11,689
There's no need to rush.

337
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:13,622
Ah...

338
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:21,355
I hope you can
forgive me Goddess.

Hng. Huh?

00:14:54,855 --> 00:14:56,289
Oh yeah...

00:14:56,822 --> 00:14:59,322
SWEET!

That was pretty dumb...

362
00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:19,989
I wound up pretty far in.

I guess I should probably
head back out now‐

[RIVERIA]
Wait until they hear this.

366
00:15:26,255 --> 00:15:30,189
You defeated a floor boss

[RIVERIA]
Huh?

370
00:15:49,255 --> 00:15:52,222
It looks like Mind Down.

371
00:15:52,322 --> 00:15:54,655
He must've used magic
without actually knowing

372
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:55,822
what would happen
to him.

373
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:56,989
It's... him.

00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,255
What's the matter, Ais?

375
00:15:58,355 --> 00:15:59,589
Do you know this guy?

[AIS]
Well, we haven't
exactly spoken...

But... I've seen him
down here...

I see.

379
00:16:06,555 --> 00:16:10,455
He's the poor soul who paid
for our unfortunate mistake.

380
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:11,689
That's correct.

381
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:12,889
So I...

382
00:16:12,989 --> 00:16:14,955
I would like to make it
up to him.

Well then, why don't you
tell him what you told me?

00:16:20,322 --> 00:16:22,689
I'm sure that'll
be more than enough.

386
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:25,155
[AIS]
Hm? You really
think so?

387
00:16:25,255 --> 00:16:29,022
[RIVERIA]
Trust me, it will.
I'll go on ahead.

[BELL]
Mom?

00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:45,989
No. Sorry, I'm afraid
I am not your mother.

391
00:16:46,722 --> 00:16:47,922
Am I dreaming...?

00:16:48,022 --> 00:16:51,122
Mph... This isn't
a dream either.

Hm.

394
00:16:57,889 --> 00:16:58,889
Huh?

AHHH!

Why does he always
end up running away?

Aaggghh...

I‐I ran away again!

00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:25,289
Hm?

405
00:17:25,389 --> 00:17:26,789
[HESTIA]
What's wrong, Bell?

406
00:17:26,889 --> 00:17:28,455
You have a
bad dream again?

407
00:17:28,555 --> 00:17:29,522
Huh?

00:17:29,622 --> 00:17:31,022
(Still sobbing)

409
00:17:31,122 --> 00:17:34,122
Is this because of that
book you read yesterday?

410
00:17:34,989 --> 00:17:35,655
Ah!

411
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:36,989
Huh?

412
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,089
[BELL]
A Grimoire?

413
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:42,989
[HESTIA]
Yeah. It's a book that
makes you able to use
magic just by reading it,

414
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:44,322
so it's super powerful.

415
00:17:44,422 --> 00:17:47,622
How did you get your
hands on this thing?

416
00:17:47,722 --> 00:17:49,589
It was at
the tavern.

417
00:17:49,689 --> 00:17:52,689
Somebody left it,
so they said I could borrow it.

418
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:54,522
Somebody left this?!

419
00:17:54,622 --> 00:17:56,655
(Sigh)
Ah! Wait, what's the
matter, Goddess Hestia?

420
00:17:56,755 --> 00:18:00,622
Okay... Here's the thing, Bell.
Now listen up...

421
00:18:00,722 --> 00:18:04,489
Once the first person reads it
all the power disappears
without a trace!

422
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:05,455
(Frantic gasp)

AHH... AH!

Uh... And just where do
you think you're going?

and find a way to‐

[HESTIA]
Forget it!
Huh?!

428
00:18:15,189 --> 00:18:16,389
Obviously you
have no idea

429
00:18:16,489 --> 00:18:18,655
how much a grimoire
is worth.

430
00:18:18,755 --> 00:18:21,222
It's practically the same
as a top‐class item

431
00:18:21,322 --> 00:18:22,689
from Hephaistos herself!

432
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:23,655
Maybe MORE!

00:18:23,755 --> 00:18:24,655
AHH!

434
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:26,589
(Extended screaming)

435
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,355
Listen carefully, Bell.

436
00:18:28,455 --> 00:18:30,889
You didn't read
this book, understand?

437
00:18:30,989 --> 00:18:32,089
Not one chapter.

438
00:18:32,189 --> 00:18:34,322
I'll take care of
this mess somehow.

439
00:18:34,422 --> 00:18:36,022

Just leave it to me.

are you gonna do?!

Don't try to stop me!

There's too many bad things
in the lower world

Oh dear, Bell, you've done
a seriously terrible thing.

Wait a second!

I'm sorry,

you think I

I didn't know how else
I was going to get her
attention.

483
00:20:03,522 --> 00:20:05,589
[RIVERIA]
I would've been forced
to do so anyway.

484
00:20:05,689 --> 00:20:10,455
At least this way I can take
comfort in knowing that it
will be useful to you.

485
00:20:10,555 --> 00:20:11,655
Okay, you promised.

486
00:20:11,755 --> 00:20:13,922
Answer her
question, please.
(Extended aahing)

487
00:20:14,022 --> 00:20:15,322
[LOKI]
Okay, okay!

488
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,455
So you wanna know
what the Soma Familia

489
00:20:17,555 --> 00:20:18,789
is all about, right?

490
00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:20,022
[EINA]
Yes, please.

491
00:20:20,122 --> 00:20:23,122
Well... how should
I explain this?

492
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:27,389
I know what those guys worship
and it sure ain't Soma.

493
00:20:27,489 --> 00:20:28,689
It's wine.

494
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:30,722
Huh?

495
00:20:39,922 --> 00:20:42,655
Master Bell must
be running late.

496
00:20:42,755 --> 00:20:45,822
Uh. AH!

497
00:20:45,922 --> 00:20:48,555
Hm? Shouldn't Lili
be here by now?

498
00:20:48,655 --> 00:20:49,822
Ah? Ah‐

499
00:20:49,922 --> 00:20:52,222
[BELL]
Oh, there she is!

500
00:20:53,855 --> 00:20:55,689
Huh?! Lili!

501
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:56,922
Hey, there.

502
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,955
Uh! You're that guy from
the other night.

503
00:21:00,055 --> 00:21:01,455
(Tense breath)

504
00:21:01,555 --> 00:21:04,322
[GEDO]
So you hired the little
street meat, did ya?

505
00:21:04,422 --> 00:21:07,089
I guess you must have figured
out what's going on then, huh?

506
00:21:07,189 --> 00:21:08,922
What are you
talking about?

507
00:21:09,022 --> 00:21:10,522
Oh, don't even.

508
00:21:10,622 --> 00:21:12,055
But okay, check this out.

509
00:21:12,155 --> 00:21:13,555
I can help you
get back at her.

510
00:21:13,655 --> 00:21:16,455
Huh?!
C'mon, what's
that look for?

511
00:21:16,555 --> 00:21:18,055
I mean you do want a
piece of everything

512
00:21:18,155 --> 00:21:19,989
she's been stashin'
away, don't ya?

513
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:22,455
Think about it.
It's just a couple o' guys

514
00:21:22,555 --> 00:21:26,622
makin' a few bucks off of
some skeezin' little
pack‐mule, am I right?

515
00:21:26,722 --> 00:21:27,855
(Seething)

516
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:28,855
No way.

517
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,422
[GEDO]
Ahh?

518
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:31,955
No! Never!

519
00:21:32,055 --> 00:21:35,489
Fine.
Suit yourself, kid.

520
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:37,189
Moron.

521
00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:39,689
(Tense breathing)

522
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:41,422
[LILI]
Master Bell.
Huh?

523
00:21:41,522 --> 00:21:43,255
Were you there
this whole time?

524
00:21:43,355 --> 00:21:45,755
So that adventurer guy...

525
00:21:45,855 --> 00:21:47,789
What were to two of you
talking about?

526
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,022
Oh no, don't worry.

527
00:21:49,122 --> 00:21:50,422
It wasn't
anything important.

528
00:21:50,522 --> 00:21:53,122
He just wanted
to chat... yeah...

529
00:21:53,222 --> 00:21:54,622
Anyway, what about you?

530
00:21:54,722 --> 00:21:56,822
[BELL]
That looked
pretty serious.

531
00:21:56,922 --> 00:21:58,289
You okay?

532
00:21:58,389 --> 00:21:59,622
I'm fine.

533
00:21:59,722 --> 00:22:01,355
It was nothing.

534
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:04,022
[LILI]
Ready to go?
Ah... Hm...

535
00:22:09,622 --> 00:22:13,455
Well, looks like it's
about that time, huh?

536
00:22:13,955 --> 00:22:16,322
(Ending Song)

537
