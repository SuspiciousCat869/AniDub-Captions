1
00:00:02,166 --> 00:00:03,833
[BELL, VOICE‐OVER]
That's right...

2
00:00:03,933 --> 00:00:06,366
it was a clear day...
just like this one.

3
00:00:06,466 --> 00:00:10,000
[MAN]
Bell! Something's
happened...

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,566
[BELL, VOICE‐OVER]
My grandfather was attacked
and killed by a monster

5
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,566
up in the mountains.

6
00:00:19,433 --> 00:00:21,866
They said he fell
into a chasm.

7
00:00:21,966 --> 00:00:25,000
I couldn't even
go look for him.

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,366
Grandfather,
I'm going... to be...

9
00:00:34,466 --> 00:00:36,200
an adventurer.

10
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:45,333
[BELL, VOICE‐OVER]
The problem was,

11
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:47,733
it was impossible to find
a Familia out there...

12
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:50,666
(People laughing)
that would accept an
adventurer as weak as me.

13
00:00:50,766 --> 00:00:53,500
[GATEKEEPER 1]
Forget it, kid. Get outta
here! Take a hike!

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,733
(Bell grimacing)
[GATEKEEPER 2]
Maybe we could hire you
to sweep the floor.

15
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,333
(People laughing)
[GATEKEEPER 3]
You'll have to pay
us to work here!

16
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:00,466
[BELL]
Please, sir!

17
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:02,100
I just want to help.
Please let me join your‐

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,366
[GATEKEEPER]
I said, no!

19
00:01:03,466 --> 00:01:05,400
Come back when you're
stronger, squirt.

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,400
Now take off!

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,633
(Bell sighs)

22
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:09,666
[HESTIA]
Hello there.

23
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,433
You're looking
for a Familia?

24
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,266
[BELL, VOICE‐OVER]
And there she was...

25
00:01:20,966 --> 00:01:22,666
A goddess.

26
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:24,366
(Laughs)

27
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:35,000
[BELL, VOICE‐OVER]
My goddess.

28
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,333
(Roaring)

29
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:38,900
I'm buying you
some time, Goddess.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,133
So get out of here
and save yourself.

31
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:43,033
Bell, what are you
talking about?!

32
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:45,300
Open this door,
right now!

33
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:47,500
Listen to me...

34
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,166
Whatever happens, I'm not
losing any more family.

35
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:52,633
Bell, please!

36
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:54,266
Come back!

37
00:01:54,366 --> 00:01:56,166
(Bell panting)
BELL!

38
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:58,666
(Opening song begins)

39
00:03:29,432 --> 00:03:31,965
(Wrangler grunting)

40
00:03:32,065 --> 00:03:34,965
The monsters escaped?!
How did this happen?

41
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:37,198
[ATTENDANT 1]
There's something wrong
with all the guards.

42
00:03:37,298 --> 00:03:39,632
It looks like their spirits
have been drained somehow.

43
00:03:39,732 --> 00:03:41,398
We have reason to
suspect that an outsider

44
00:03:41,498 --> 00:03:43,098
could have been
responsible for this.

45
00:03:43,198 --> 00:03:45,032
We'll have to figure
that out later!

46
00:03:45,132 --> 00:03:46,765
Tell me, how many
did we lose?

47
00:03:46,865 --> 00:03:48,198
We've lost nine,
my lord.

48
00:03:48,298 --> 00:03:50,098
And a suppression force has
already been assembled

49
00:03:50,198 --> 00:03:51,898
and begun searching
the area.

50
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:54,432
They're not going
to be fast enough!

51
00:03:54,532 --> 00:03:56,665
We'll need assistance
from other Familias.

52
00:03:56,765 --> 00:03:59,965
[GANESHA]
Now go forth and request aid
from the other deusdea!

53
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:01,298
Uh yes, but,
my lord...

54
00:04:01,398 --> 00:04:02,698
Our Familia is
the one at fault

55
00:04:02,798 --> 00:04:04,632
for letting them get out
in the first place!

56
00:04:04,732 --> 00:04:07,665
Asking for help from other
sources would be a great
dishonor to us!

57
00:04:07,765 --> 00:04:11,498
[GANESHA]
I am Ganesha,
leader of this Familia.

58
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:14,098
Our concern is for the
happiness of our children,

59
00:04:14,198 --> 00:04:16,465
not petty status
or prestige!

60
00:04:16,565 --> 00:04:19,832
The safety of our beloved
citizens comes first!

61
00:04:19,932 --> 00:04:21,532
[ATTENDANTS]
Yes, Lord Ganesha!

62
00:04:21,632 --> 00:04:22,965
[GANESHA]
Now, in the meantime...

63
00:04:23,065 --> 00:04:24,632
try to keep the
chaos contained.

64
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:27,465
The festival shall
proceed as planned.

65
00:04:27,565 --> 00:04:28,132
Begone!

66
00:04:28,232 --> 00:04:29,132
[ATTENDANTS]
Right!

67
00:04:29,232 --> 00:04:31,232
(Receding footsteps)

68
00:04:33,832 --> 00:04:35,898
[GANESHA, THINKING]
What is it they're after?

69
00:04:35,998 --> 00:04:38,098
(Crowd cheering)

70
00:04:38,198 --> 00:04:41,232
[GANESHA]
Are they trying to
create a diversion?

71
00:04:41,332 --> 00:04:44,165
Or maybe...
something else.

72
00:04:44,265 --> 00:04:46,032
(Bell panting)
(Silverback roars)

73
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:47,232
Ah!

74
00:04:49,298 --> 00:04:53,298
(Heavy breathing)

75
00:04:54,932 --> 00:04:56,132
(Shattering)

76
00:04:56,232 --> 00:04:57,865
[BELL]
Goddess Hestia...

77
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:58,798
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:01,132
AH! O‐ow...

79
00:05:01,465 --> 00:05:02,698
Ow...

80
00:05:04,798 --> 00:05:06,598
(Sighs)

81
00:05:09,798 --> 00:05:13,532
[HEPHAISTOS]
Alright, Hestia.
Now listen to me carefully.

82
00:05:13,632 --> 00:05:15,798
That knife generates a
Status that accompanies

83
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,798
whatever hieroglyphs you
happen to engrave into it.

84
00:05:18,898 --> 00:05:22,898
So what I'm telling you is...
the knife is alive.

85
00:05:22,998 --> 00:05:24,432
It's alive?

86
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,498
[HEPHAISTOS]
As soon as Bell Cranel
receives this weapon,

87
00:05:27,598 --> 00:05:31,298
it will draw its first
breath and start growing
along with him.

88
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:32,998
[HESTIA, THINKING]
I'm coming, Bell!

89
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:34,265
[EINA]
Sure, that'd be great.

90
00:05:34,365 --> 00:05:35,932
[MISHA]
Eina! Eina!
[BOY]
Thank you!

91
00:05:36,032 --> 00:05:37,898
(Eina giggles)

00:05:37,998 --> 00:05:38,965
(Whispering)

93
00:05:39,065 --> 00:05:40,198
What, are
you sure?!

94
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,965
Yeah. I just heard
it straight from

95
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:43,532
the Ganesha Familia!

96
00:05:43,632 --> 00:05:45,998
They said several monsters
escaped from the west gate!

97
00:05:46,098 --> 00:05:47,132
[EINA]
Shhh! Please, Misha...
Mm!

98
00:05:47,232 --> 00:05:48,498
don't be so loud!

99
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,632
We don't want
to cause a panic.

100
00:05:50,732 --> 00:05:52,032
Right. Right!

101
00:05:52,132 --> 00:05:53,965
So anyway... they said
to ask for help

102
00:05:54,065 --> 00:05:55,432
from any adventurers
I could find,

103
00:05:55,532 --> 00:05:56,798
regardless of what Familia

104
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,198
they happen to be from.

105
00:05:58,298 --> 00:06:00,498
Oh great, not sure we want
the ones around here.

106
00:06:00,598 --> 00:06:02,332
[LOKI] Whoo,
smells like money!
[BOTH] Huh?

107

YEOW!
Excuse me what's
going on?

108
00:06:04,432 --> 00:06:06,398
[MISHA] Whoa.

109

[LOKI](Continued agony)
It's you.

[BELL, THINKING]
I hope... Goddess Hestia
was able to get away...

00:06:49,065 --> 00:06:50,632
(Silverback growling)

124
00:06:52,798 --> 00:06:56,932
Miss Ais isn't gonna save me.
Not this time anyway.

00:06:59,165 --> 00:07:00,932
[BELL, THINKING]
I wanted to meet her...

127
00:07:01,032 --> 00:07:02,565
at least one more time.

128
00:07:02,665 --> 00:07:04,965
But I guess this
is for the best.

129
00:07:05,065 --> 00:07:06,998
I can't let her see me
like this again.

130

00:07:16,632 --> 00:07:17,665
[LOKI]
Heh.

134
00:07:17,765 --> 00:07:18,998
That's my girl!

135
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:20,998
Kickin' mad
monster booty!

136
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:22,732
[LOKI]
Ooh, speaking
of booty... Ah!

137
00:07:22,832 --> 00:07:24,565
[AIS]
Okay. How many more are
still out there?

138
00:07:24,665 --> 00:07:26,032
[LOKI] (In pain)
That's okay,
I know you love me.

139
00:07:26,132 --> 00:07:27,398
Well, the other adventurers

140
00:07:27,498 --> 00:07:28,998
are keeping them contained
for the time being...

141
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:31,065
but there should be
about three or four.

142
00:07:31,165 --> 00:07:31,932
Hm.

143
00:07:32,032 --> 00:07:33,065
(Guildmen panting)

144
00:07:33,165 --> 00:07:36,165
[LOKI]
Ugh...
Hey, wait for me!

145
00:07:36,265 --> 00:07:37,598
[MISHA]
Wow.

146
00:07:37,698 --> 00:07:40,332
The Sword Princess sure
is something, huh?

147
00:07:40,432 --> 00:07:43,132
Right? I can certainly see
why Bell's become

148
00:07:43,232 --> 00:07:44,432
so attracted to her.

149
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:46,098
[EINA, THINKING]
Hopefully....

150

he's not caught
up in this mess too.

(Silverback snarling)
[BELL, THINKING]
Goodbye, Goddess...

[HESTIA]
Bell!

00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,232
[BELL, THINKING]
Oh, no...

Why are you here...?

(Hestia laughs)

157
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:01,132
You weren't supposed
to follow me!

I ran so fast trying

Maybe go for a drink?

kinda guilty.

If I hadn't
forgotten my wallet,

Ah?
Everybody's been
talking about you, Bell.

It's because you were
so brave and strong

when you fought
that monster.

Oh, I'm not brave.

well actually...

I got to see a little bit
of the battle...

what I saw.

Uh yeah... I guess
I was more tired out
than I thought I was.

I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to scare you.

430
00:19:51,332 --> 00:19:53,232
So I talked to
Miss Syr earlier.

431
00:19:53,332 --> 00:19:55,398
And she told me all the
other monsters that escaped

432
00:19:55,498 --> 00:19:57,465
have already been
taken care of.

Miss Ais Wallenstein...
she helped out with them too.

Wow... How
'bout that?

Oh, I was
wondering...
Huh?

[BELL]
I was looking
at the knife...

00:20:07,565 --> 00:20:11,465
Does that really say
"Hephaistos"... as in...?

Huh!
As in THE Hephaistos!

Oh come on...

you've always got your face

against her shop window.

Now, it may not be exactly
what you were looking for...

only one of its kind

Listen...

I don't want to just
sit and watch.

450
00:20:38,998 --> 00:20:43,565
I never liked being...
taken care of, y'know?

00:20:43,665 --> 00:20:44,765
Or fussed over.

How'd you get this?

453
00:20:46,365 --> 00:20:48,965
Hephaistos Familia weapons
are insanely expensive!

It's all been
handled!
Huh?

be stronger.

And I want
to help you!

I know it's
not much...

me do this, okay?

use you as a decoy.
