1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,666
(Street chatter)

2
00:00:03,766 --> 00:00:06,333
[EINA]
SERIOUSLY? FLOOR SEVEN?!

3
00:00:06,433 --> 00:00:08,133
But it was only just
the other day

4
00:00:08,233 --> 00:00:10,533
you almost got yourself
killed on level five!

5
00:00:10,633 --> 00:00:12,866
What in the world makes you
think you're ready for seven?!

6
00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:14,666
How insane can
you possibly be?!

7
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:16,200
Aw! Please, Miss Eina?

8
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,466
I've really grown
a lot since then.

9
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:21,633
I mean did I tell you my Status
is all the way up to E already?

10
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:22,800
C'mon...

11
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,733
[EINA]
E?

12
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,100
But, no, that's not...

13
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,300
even possible...

14
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,133
Hmm...
Let's see...

15
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:33,333
Strength and endurance
are both E.

16
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:36,266
And agility... D?!
Huh?

17
00:00:36,366 --> 00:00:37,800
[EINA]
You weren't kidding, Bell!

18
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,266
You've been advancing
extremely quickly!

19
00:00:40,366 --> 00:00:42,900
I‐I'm not able to read the whole
thing, but...

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,533
Well, your abilities do
appear to be genuine.

21
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:47,566
So I guess that means
it'll be okay with you

22
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,833
if I go down to floor
seven starting today.

23
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:52,533
On the one hand, if your Status
is really that impressive,

24
00:00:52,633 --> 00:00:57,300
I have no reason not to clear
you for floor seven, but, um...

25
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,600
[EINA]
On the other hand,
your armor...

26
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,833
Ugh...

27
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:02,033
Tell you what...

28
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:04,366
do you have any
plans for tomorrow?

29
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:06,133
Huh?

30
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,366
(Opening Song)

31
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:43,666
Huh?

32
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:44,666
[EINA]
Bell!

33
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:45,666
Over here!

34
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,633
Ah. Oh, Miss Eina!

35
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:48,633
Huh?!

36
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:49,700
(Eina giggling)

37
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,000
(Bell speechless)
Ah... Um...

38
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,166
Morning.

39
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:55,500
Wow you got here
pretty early.

40
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,266
Were you looking forward
to spending the day

41
00:02:57,366 --> 00:02:58,666
shopping with me that much?

42
00:02:58,766 --> 00:03:01,333
Ah! Uh!
Uh, no, I'm just...

43
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:04,600
It's okay, I must admit I was
pretty excited to see you, too.

44
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,866
(Shy exhale)
[EINA]
That's why I got
all dressed up.

45
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:09,600
O‐oh?
(Giggles)

46
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,566
[EINA]
Uh, Bell?
(Panicked breath)

47
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,900
This is the part where
you compliment my outfit.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,900
Go ahead.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,700
OH! Oh, uh...
it's nice...

50
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,900
You, uh... you look
a lot younger!

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Ah!
What?!
Hey, I'm not that old
to begin with, you know!

52
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,466
(Struggling)
[EINA]
You'd better apologize
to me right now, mister!

53
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:27,400
(Laughing)

54
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,033
Could you please
let go of me?!

55
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:35,900
(Groan) So, where are
we going today, Miss Eina?

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,933
(Giggle)

57
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:38,266
In there.

58
00:03:38,366 --> 00:03:38,833
Huh?

59
00:03:38,933 --> 00:03:40,300
[BELL]
Babel?

60
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,200
[EINA]
Right. To the
Hephaistos Familia shop.

61
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,733
[BELL]
Wait...

62
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,066
WHAAA‐?!

63
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,233
No way! Their stuff is
so freaking expensive

64
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,933
I can't even afford to THINK
about buying something there!

65
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:53,333
Would you stop yelling?

66
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,833
You really should
loosen up a little.

67
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:57,066
Uh! Uh!
M‐Miss Eina!

68
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,900
[EINA](Giggling)
Let's get shopping!

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,500
(Elevator dings)
(Doors scrape open)

70
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:06,700
[BELL]
Hm? Huh?

71
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,233
Ah!
(Amazed laughter)

72
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:12,000
[BELL]
I had no idea there was a
shop like this in Babel.

73
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,600
This is incredible!

74
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,866
Of course the top of it
attracts the most attention...

75
00:04:15,966 --> 00:04:19,500
but it also happens to be one
of the Hephaistos storefronts.

76
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,400
Let's look around.

77
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,100
Huh? Oh...

78
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,733
WHOA! That says it's
30 million valis!

79
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:30,666
(Door creaks)
[HESTIA]
Welcome!

80
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:31,866
[BOTH]
Hm?

81
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:33,566
What can I do
for you today,

82
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,333
valued customers?

83
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:35,933
Huh?

84
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:37,333
Oh!

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,233
Bell!
Goddess!

86
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,566
What are you
doing here?!

87
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,300
I know you've been
kinda busy lately,

88
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,900
(Giggles)
but you never told
me anything

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,966
about having two jobs!

90
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:46,200
Uh, well first,

91
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,833
I'd like to know
what YOU'RE doing here!

92
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:49,166
(Grunts)

93
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:51,766
AFTER you tell me who
this half‐elf is!

94
00:04:51,866 --> 00:04:52,900
Oh right.
Goddess Hestia,

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,300
I'd like you
to meet, uh‐

96
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,833
It is a pleasure to meet
you, Goddess Hestia.

97
00:04:56,933 --> 00:04:59,600
I am Guildswoman
Eina Tulle.

98
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,133
But more specifically...

99
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:04,066
I am also the labyrinth search
advisor for Mr. Bell Cranel.

100
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,966
Ohh... Is that so?

101
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:08,200
Uh...

102
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,400
Looky here,
Miss Advisor.

103
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,166
You wouldn't be abusing
your position to try and
seduce my precious Bell,

104
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:16,466
now would you? Hmm?

105
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,333
Huh?!

106
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:18,466
(Seething)

107
00:05:18,566 --> 00:05:20,033
[EINA]
Um... I‐I like to
keep business

108
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:22,333
and pleasure
separate.

109
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:24,166
[BELL]
Uh...

110
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:27,633
[EINA]
She's a ... character,
isn't she?

111
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:28,966
(Awkward sigh)

112
00:05:29,066 --> 00:05:31,033
(Crowd chatter)

113
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:32,800
[EINA]
Well okay,
here we are.

114
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,400
Now I assume...

115
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,066
you think that all these
high‐quality Hephaistos items

116
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,600
are going to be way out of
your price range, right?

117
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,300
Uh... Well, yeah...

118
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,000
Well, you might
be surprised.

119
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,833
[EINA]
See? Look
at this one.

120
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:49,900
[BELL]
W‐wow. That's not
that expensive.

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,833
(Laughs)

122
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,133
Pretty good, right?

123
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:53,766
[EINA]
Everything sold
here is made

124
00:05:53,866 --> 00:05:55,233
by novice craftsmen.

125
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,833
It can be sold for cheap,
way below standard prices.

126
00:05:57,933 --> 00:05:59,866
Plus, good reviews
are a big help

127
00:05:59,966 --> 00:06:01,666
for all the beginner
blacksmiths.

128
00:06:01,766 --> 00:06:05,100
Sometimes you can find
a real bargain if you
know where look!

129
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,100
Shall we move on?

130
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,633
(Excited gasp)

131
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:13,933
[BELL]
Wow!

132
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:14,900
Woah!

133
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,366
(Both laugh)

134
00:06:17,466 --> 00:06:19,866
I'm gonna go take a look
over there, okay?

135
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:21,200
Woo!
Oh, Bell‐!

136
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,000
(Bell laughs)
There he goes...

137
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,633
Aha!

138
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:28,033
Huh?

139
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:35,600
Oh? Hm.

140
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,633
(Metal clanking)
Ooh...

141
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:44,266
Hm?

142
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,066
Looks like there's
a signature here.

143
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:50,433
"Welf Crozzo"...

144
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:52,900
Let's see... it's...

145
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,433
Huh?! 9,900 valis?!

146
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:57,766
That's about all
I've got on me.

147
00:06:57,866 --> 00:07:00,200
But still...
(Footsteps)

148
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,100
Ah, I thought you might
find your way back here.

149
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,533
Huh?
I found a couple of good
pieces over by the‐

150
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,700
Uh... Huh?

151
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,866
Check this out!

152
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:09,100
I think I'm
gonna buy it!

153
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,666
Oh, Bell...
Hm?

154
00:07:10,766 --> 00:07:12,066
I should've known
you'd end up

155
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,933
picking another piece
of light armor.

156
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,600
I‐is that a
bad thing?

157
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,666
It's fine. If that's
what you're looking for.

158
00:07:18,766 --> 00:07:20,866
And if your heart's set
on that particular one,

159
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:21,933
I think you
should get it.

160
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:23,033
Hah!

161
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:24,566
I think so too.

162
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,500
[EINA]
Are you going into
the dungeon tomorrow?
Yeah!

163
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,400
Well, I would really
like it if you would

164
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,066
team up with someone
if you can.

165
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,366
You could at least find
a supporter for me.

166
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:35,333
Do you think I
should hire one?

167
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:39,033
Yes! I think it would make you
a more effecient adventurer.

168
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:41,233
I'd be happy to help you
find one if you want.

169
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:45,533
Ohh... Well let me
think about it, okay?

170
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:51,233
Thanks a lot for all
your help today.

171
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,033
Oh, one
more thing...
Hm?

172
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:55,566
[EINA]
I want you to
have this.

173
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,100
Oh, thank you.
What is it?

174
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,066
It's a present
from me to you.

175
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,133
And don't you
forget to use it.

176
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:05,000
Huh?! But I can't
accept this!

177
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,733
No, you are going
to take it.

178
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:10,566
Not just for my sake,
Bell, but for your own.

179
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,000
Huh?

180
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,233
It's a hard life.

181
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,833
Adventurers have no
way of knowing

182
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:16,466
what day might
be their last.

183
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:17,566
Huh...

184
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:18,700
[EINA]
I've known several

185
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,500
who didn't
make it back alive.

186
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,866
Hm...

187
00:08:22,966 --> 00:08:24,800
I don't want to lose
you, too, Bell...

188
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,966
I can't do it.

189
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:27,333
(Laughs)

190
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:29,800
I guess maybe it is for
my sake then, isn't it?

191
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,133
Huh? Ah!

192
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:35,166
Well besides, when I see
how hard you work at this,

193
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:38,300
I really just want to do
whatever I can to help you out.

194
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,133
Please accept it, Bell.
Please take it.

195
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:43,300
[EINA]
For me?

196
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,700
(Shy gasp)

197
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:51,200
Okay, I will...
thank you, Eina.

198
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,333
Well you are
very welcome.

199
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,500

It's getting
kinda late.

00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,133

AH!

201
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:01,733

You okay?

202
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,500
(Weak struggle)

203
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,400
[GEDO]
Just where do you
think you're going,
[BELL] Huh?

204
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,466
you stupid,
pathetic Prum!

205
00:09:08,566 --> 00:09:09,533
Ahh!

206
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:10,500
(Mystical humming)

(Bell and Gedo struggling)

209
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,166
[GEDO]
You got a problem?

210
00:09:15,266 --> 00:09:16,800
This mongrel a
friend of yours?

211
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,000
N‐no! I've never
met her before!

212
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,866
[GEDO]
Then why are you
trying to help her?

213
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:24,266
Huh? Uh, because
she's a girl.

214
00:09:24,366 --> 00:09:25,266
Well...

215
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:27,166
That's a ridiculous
reason to die.

216
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,533
[RYU]
That's enough.

217
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:29,466
Huh?!

218
00:09:29,566 --> 00:09:31,233
Please.

219
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,033
Crossing swords within
the city limits...

220
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:35,966
you two ought
to be ashamed.

221
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:38,366
And you oughtta keep
your fat mouth shut!

222
00:09:38,466 --> 00:09:39,766
Now beat it
before I have to‐

223
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:40,933
[RYU]
Be quiet.

224
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:42,966
Uh...

225
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:46,000
[RYU]
We should avoid
resorting to violence.

226
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,066
I tend to get carried
away sometimes.

227
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,300
(Angered grunt)

228
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,033

(Sigh)

230
00:09:55,966 --> 00:09:57,933
Now that was
pretty awesome.

231
00:09:58,033 --> 00:09:59,400
Thank you
for saving me.

232
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,900
I probably shouldn't
have interfered.

233
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,133
[BELL]
Oh? Oh,
that girl...

234
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:07,000
Where'd she... go?

235
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:08,466
(Gasp)

236
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,866
[BELL]
Must've gotten
scared and ran off.

00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:12,066
(Sly chuckle)

238
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,800
Syr would be
extremely upset

239
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,466
if you got
yourself hurt.

240
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:16,466
[RYU]
Be careful.

241
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:17,466
Hm?

242
00:10:17,566 --> 00:10:18,800
Uh... right.

00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,000
Well, goodbye then,

Thank you
so much, Miss Ryu!

245
00:10:22,766 --> 00:10:25,166
[RYU]
Mhm. Goodnight.

00:10:29,975 --> 00:10:33,342

00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:35,908
[BELL]
All set!

248
00:10:36,642 --> 00:10:37,775
Hm.

00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,942

250
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:43,075
Goddess, I'm
heading out now.

Uh‐huh. Okay, I'll see
ya later...

00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,208

(Chuckle)

254
00:10:57,075 --> 00:10:59,775
Huh. Hm.

255
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:05,175
So a supporter, huh?

256
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:07,008
[LILI]
Mister! Hey, Mister!

257
00:11:07,108 --> 00:11:08,975
You with the
white hair!
Ah! Huh?

258
00:11:09,075 --> 00:11:10,575
A very good day
to you, sir!

259
00:11:10,675 --> 00:11:13,208
Sorry to bother you, but would
you happen to be in the market

260
00:11:13,308 --> 00:11:14,008
for a supporter?

261
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:15,108
Huh? Hey, uh...

262
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,542
you're the girl
from last night.

263
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,908
Uh, what? I'm sorry you
must be confused.

264
00:11:19,008 --> 00:11:21,342
But it's not really all
that complicated, sir.

265
00:11:21,442 --> 00:11:23,842
Uh.
[LILI]
I'm just a poor,
lonely supporter

266
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:25,542
offering her services
to an adventurer

267
00:11:25,642 --> 00:11:27,675
who doesn't have
a partner.

268
00:11:27,775 --> 00:11:31,475
Yeah I kinda gathered that.
But, you are...

269
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:33,475
the prum I met
yesterday, right?

270
00:11:33,575 --> 00:11:35,242
I'm... not a prum.

271
00:11:35,342 --> 00:11:37,308
I'm a chienthrope.

272
00:11:37,408 --> 00:11:39,108
It's like...
an animal person.

273
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:42,142
Chienthrope?
Well look at that.

274
00:11:42,242 --> 00:11:43,942
Mmm... AH!

275
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:46,042
That's not
appropriate!

276
00:11:46,142 --> 00:11:48,375
Ah!
Sorry about that.

277
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,575
You just
surprised me.

278
00:11:51,742 --> 00:11:52,975
(Snicker)

279
00:11:56,075 --> 00:11:58,908
[BELL]
So, uh... Liliruca, was it?

280
00:11:59,008 --> 00:12:00,842
Why did you ask me?

281
00:12:00,942 --> 00:12:04,208
Well, it seemed to me like
you were all by yourself.

282
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:06,108
I mean you're an
adventurer, right,

283
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,075
and you're carrying
a backpack around, so...

284
00:12:08,175 --> 00:12:09,908
I kind of just
assumed, y'know?

285
00:12:10,008 --> 00:12:11,008
Ah.

286
00:12:11,108 --> 00:12:12,642
So have you decided
yet, Mister?

287
00:12:12,742 --> 00:12:14,542
You want me to be
your supporter or what?

288
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:19,075
To tell you the truth, I have
thought about getting one.

289
00:12:19,175 --> 00:12:20,375
It sounds like a good idea.

290
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:21,742
Wow, you think so?!

291
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,308
Does that mean you'll take
me with you, Mister?!

292
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:25,208
Pretty please!
U‐uh!

293
00:12:25,308 --> 00:12:26,775
I don't have much money...

294
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,642
so I wasn't sure exactly
what I was gonna do...

295
00:12:29,742 --> 00:12:33,042
Besides, you do
kinda owe me...

296
00:12:33,142 --> 00:12:35,142
'Cause you touched my
special spot...

And you didn't
get my permission.

298
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:40,908
U‐uh...
[LILI]
You need to take responsibility
for such behavior.

Y‐you've got
a point.
Ah!

302
00:12:44,575 --> 00:12:46,242
I guess maybe
I will hire you

303
00:12:46,342 --> 00:12:47,808
as my supporter then.

304
00:12:47,908 --> 00:12:49,442
But just for today.

305
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:51,475
You won't
regret this!

(Bell sighs)

318
00:13:12,842 --> 00:13:14,542
It's good to have you
here with me, Lili,

319
00:13:14,642 --> 00:13:16,875
now I can concentrate
more on fighting.

[LILI]
Oh, no!

321
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,042
You taking out all
those monsters alone

322
00:13:20,142 --> 00:13:23,742
was way more impressive than
anything I did, Master Bell!

323
00:13:23,842 --> 00:13:25,942
Although, I'm guessing most
of your power

324
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:28,875
probably comes from that weapon
you're using, doesn't it?

325
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,775
Yeah, you can say
that again.

326
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:35,742
[BELL]
I'm starting to wonder if
I'm depending on it too much.

327
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,108
Hm...

328
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:42,042
[LILI]
So, where did you get a
knife like that anyway?

329
00:13:42,142 --> 00:13:43,808
Huh?
Where'd I get it?

330
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:46,575
Well, the Goddess of my
Familia gave it to me.

331
00:13:46,675 --> 00:13:50,308
Oh, that reminds me, are you a
member of a Familia too, Lili?

332
00:13:50,408 --> 00:13:53,175
[LILI]
Yep. The Soma Familia.

333
00:13:53,275 --> 00:13:55,275
Yeah? That's pretty cool.

334
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,142
Hey, Master Bell.

335
00:13:57,242 --> 00:13:59,675
That one still has
its magic stone.

336
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:02,142
[LILI]
It shouldn't be
too deep inside.

337
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,708
I'll get the ones that
fell on the ground.

338
00:14:04,808 --> 00:14:06,875
[LILI]
Wanna call it a
day after that?

339
00:14:06,975 --> 00:14:08,608
[BELL]
Sure.

340
00:14:11,342 --> 00:14:13,275
(Struggling)

341
00:14:14,008 --> 00:14:15,375
It's kinda hard
to cut.

342
00:14:15,475 --> 00:14:19,008
(Struggling continues)

343
00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:22,375
[EINA]
Hm...

344
00:14:22,475 --> 00:14:25,242
Wait, you said that your
supporter's in the Soma Familia?

345
00:14:25,342 --> 00:14:27,675
Uh‐huh.
What's wrong with that?

346
00:14:27,775 --> 00:14:30,508
Uh, the Somas mainly focus
on exploration.

347
00:14:30,608 --> 00:14:32,408
And they sell a lot of
booze as well.

348
00:14:32,508 --> 00:14:35,208
[EINA]
Which is fine, but... Uh...

349
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:38,275
The whole group always
seems to be so desperate.

350
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:41,175
Like they're always in
a panic about something.

351
00:14:41,275 --> 00:14:44,142
But besides that,
what'd you think of Liliruca?

352
00:14:44,242 --> 00:14:46,142
Did the two of you
end up getting along?

353
00:14:46,242 --> 00:14:48,108
Yeah, she was nice!

354
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,742
[BELL]
We got a good
haul today, too.

355
00:14:50,842 --> 00:14:52,208
Well, that's great.

356
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,175
I won't suggest
otherwise then.

357
00:14:54,275 --> 00:14:55,842
Do whatever you
think is best.

358
00:14:55,942 --> 00:14:58,308
I mean, it's your own decision
to make after all.

359
00:14:58,408 --> 00:15:00,208
Thanks a lot,
Miss Eina.

360
00:15:00,308 --> 00:15:01,842
See ya!

361
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,908
[EINA]
Huh? Bell?

362
00:15:04,008 --> 00:15:05,242
Yeah?

363
00:15:05,342 --> 00:15:06,142
Your knife...

364
00:15:06,242 --> 00:15:07,142
it's gone!

365
00:15:07,242 --> 00:15:08,108
What?

366
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:11,042
[BELL]
U‐uh? Wha‐?! Uh!

367
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:13,842
(Panicking)

368
00:15:13,942 --> 00:15:17,875
[BELL]
I DROPPED MY KNIFE!

369
00:15:20,508 --> 00:15:23,008
[GNOME]
Hmm...

370
00:15:23,942 --> 00:15:25,875
I can give you
30 valis.

371
00:15:25,975 --> 00:15:27,075
[LILI]
Ah!

372
00:15:27,175 --> 00:15:28,508
[GNOME]
It's not very sharp.

373
00:15:28,608 --> 00:15:31,175
And it...
won't cut anything.

374
00:15:31,275 --> 00:15:34,342
[GNOME]
The blade's gone
completely dull.

375
00:15:38,808 --> 00:15:40,508
[LILI, THINKING]
You're kidding me!

376
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:43,208
It cut down all those monsters
without even getting scratched

377
00:15:43,308 --> 00:15:45,375
and he offers me 30 valis?!

378
00:15:45,475 --> 00:15:47,142
That's ridiculous!

379
00:15:47,242 --> 00:15:48,275
Ah!

380
00:15:51,308 --> 00:15:53,308
(Blade resonates)

381
00:15:54,275 --> 00:15:55,408
[RYU]
Wait a second.

382
00:15:55,508 --> 00:15:57,408
You, little prum.
Uh.

383
00:15:57,508 --> 00:16:00,242
[RYU]
Let me see that knife
you're hiding in your cloak.

384
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:01,442
[SYR]
Ryu?

385
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:02,808
I want to find out
if it belongs

386
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:04,108
to someone I know...

387
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,308
who lost theirs.

388
00:16:05,408 --> 00:16:07,975
[LILI]
Uh! Uh, you must
be mistaken...

389
00:16:08,075 --> 00:16:09,808
this is mine.

390
00:16:10,242 --> 00:16:11,142
I'm sorry...

391
00:16:11,242 --> 00:16:12,942
but I can't help you.

392
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:14,942
Give it to me.

393
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:18,242
I only know of one knife that's
covered in markings like that.
(Coin rings)

394
00:16:18,342 --> 00:16:19,142
[LILI]
Ah!

395
00:16:19,242 --> 00:16:20,075
And it's not yours!

396
00:16:20,175 --> 00:16:21,942
(Loud thud)
Ah!

397
00:16:22,842 --> 00:16:25,408
(Lili begins running)

398
00:16:26,342 --> 00:16:30,142
(Bell panting)

399
00:16:30,242 --> 00:16:32,108
Ugh... where did I‐?

400
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,608
[BOTH]
AH!

401
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,708
[BOTH]
Ow...

00:16:35,808 --> 00:16:38,842
Huh? L‐Lili?!

403
00:16:38,942 --> 00:16:40,908
M‐Master Bell?

(Grunt)

405
00:16:42,308 --> 00:16:43,442
[LILI]
Tch.

406
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:44,708
Hm...

407
00:16:44,808 --> 00:16:46,075
She's a chienthrope?

408
00:16:46,175 --> 00:16:48,142
[BELL]
Miss Ryu?
(Syr Panting)

409
00:16:48,242 --> 00:16:50,708
And you too, Miss Syr?

410
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:51,942
Oh, hey, uh!

411
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:54,042
Have either of you guys found
a knife around here?!

412
00:16:54,142 --> 00:16:55,442
It's jet black from
top to bottom

413
00:16:55,542 --> 00:16:57,475
and it's really, really,
REALLY important to me!

414
00:16:57,575 --> 00:16:59,042
(Knife resonates)
[RYU]
Looks like this?

415
00:16:59,142 --> 00:17:00,742
That's it...

416
00:17:00,842 --> 00:17:01,908
My knife...

417
00:17:02,008 --> 00:17:03,075
(Sniffling)

418
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:05,275
AHAHA!
You found it!
Uh!

419
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,042
Oh thank you so
much, Miss Ryu!

420
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:08,242
You're the best!

421
00:17:08,342 --> 00:17:09,275
[RYU]
Mr. Cranel,
please...

422
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,375
could you, uh,
stop that?

423
00:17:11,475 --> 00:17:13,375
(Bell awing)
I understand that
you're excited...

424
00:17:13,475 --> 00:17:15,375
Why don't you take
Syr's hand instead?

425
00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:18,075
[SYR]
Ryu, what...
What are you doing?!

426
00:17:18,175 --> 00:17:19,375
[RYU]
Here, take it.

427
00:17:19,475 --> 00:17:21,808
[BELL]
Oh, thank the gods!

428
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,475
(Mystical hum)

429
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:24,442
Huh?

430
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:26,375
Please forgive
me, Goddess.

431
00:17:26,475 --> 00:17:29,108
I swear that I will
never drop it again!

432
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,108
You dropped it?

433
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,342
Sure did.
[LILI] Uh.

434
00:17:31,442 --> 00:17:33,008
Where'd you find
it, anyway?

435
00:17:33,108 --> 00:17:34,775
[RYU]
Well, to be precise...

436
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,875
I took it from a prum
who said that she found it.

437
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:38,975
[BELL]
A Prum?

438
00:17:39,075 --> 00:17:40,575
[SYR]
Ah!

439
00:17:42,308 --> 00:17:43,708
(Chuckle)

440
00:17:43,808 --> 00:17:46,308
[RYU]
Anyway, we should
really be going.

441
00:17:46,408 --> 00:17:50,142
[BELL]
Okay, thanks again!

442
00:17:50,242 --> 00:17:52,575
You shouldn't be such
a naughty little girl.

443
00:17:52,675 --> 00:17:54,608
Ah!

444
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,975
[BELL]
Man! Talk about
great timing!

445
00:17:57,075 --> 00:18:00,875
I was afraid I wouldn't
be able to find you!

446
00:18:00,975 --> 00:18:01,808
Uh!

447
00:18:01,908 --> 00:18:03,542
So uh, Lili...

448
00:18:03,642 --> 00:18:06,342
do you want to go back to the
dungeon with me tomorrow?

449
00:18:06,442 --> 00:18:08,475
(Surprised gasp)

450
00:18:09,075 --> 00:18:10,808
Hm.

451
00:18:13,808 --> 00:18:16,608
(Birds chirping)

452
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:23,642
[LILI]
Master Bell?
[BELL]
Hm?

453
00:18:23,742 --> 00:18:26,142
Thank you for officially
hiring me.

454
00:18:26,242 --> 00:18:28,042
It really means a lot.

455
00:18:28,142 --> 00:18:28,875
Huh?

456
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,908
Where's your
weapon today?

457
00:18:32,008 --> 00:18:34,608
Don't you usually carry it
right there on your belt?

458
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,142
Yeah! I'm gonna start
keeping it in here now.

459
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:39,108
That way I won't drop it.

460
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,642
Really?

461
00:18:40,742 --> 00:18:43,775
Anyway, you sure you don't
want a down‐payment first?

462
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,342
Nah. There's only you
and me down here, so...

463
00:18:46,442 --> 00:18:49,875
it won't be too hard to
figure out who gets what.

464
00:18:49,975 --> 00:18:51,142
Besides...

465
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:52,642
Besides?

466
00:18:52,742 --> 00:18:55,242
I want to do whatever makes
things easier for you,

467
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,508
Master Bell.

468
00:18:56,608 --> 00:18:58,075
Huh?

469
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,608
Are you ready to go?

470
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,342
As long as you
do your best,

471
00:19:01,442 --> 00:19:03,908
I'm sure there won't be
any problems at all!

472
00:19:04,008 --> 00:19:06,775
Uh, right.

473
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,242
[LILI]
I wonder how much loot
we'll get today.

474
00:19:09,342 --> 00:19:10,408
[BELL]
Yeah.

475
00:19:10,508 --> 00:19:12,175
(Cash register rings)

476
00:19:12,275 --> 00:19:13,642

Twenty‐six thousand?!

I‐I'm not dreaming,
am I?

00:19:16,008 --> 00:19:17,808
W‐we really got
this much?!

You're amazing!

480
00:19:19,008 --> 00:19:20,275
Thanks to you,
we made more than

481

a whole party of five
level‐1 adventurers

482
00:19:22,342 --> 00:19:23,542
would've made combined!

00:19:23,642 --> 00:19:25,408
Well, it's like the
old saying goes,

484
00:19:25,508 --> 00:19:28,375
even rabbits can climb trees,
if you flatter them enough!

485
00:19:28,475 --> 00:19:30,275
I have no idea what
that means, but sure,

486
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,242
if you say so,
Master Bell!

487
00:19:32,342 --> 00:19:33,542
Oh, wow!

488
00:19:33,642 --> 00:19:35,975
[LILI]
Let's try to get
even more tomorrow!

489
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:39,275
Now we just have to decide how
we're gonna split the money...

490
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,208
[BELL]
Oh, here.
Uh.

491
00:19:41,308 --> 00:19:42,275
(Laughs)

492
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,642
I bet I can buy
Goddess Hestia

493
00:19:43,742 --> 00:19:45,442
lots of nice dinners
with all of this.

494
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:47,242
Huh? Wha‐?
[BELL]
Hey, speaking
of which!

495
00:19:47,342 --> 00:19:48,875
W‐w‐w‐w...
Wanna get something
to eat right now?

496
00:19:48,975 --> 00:19:49,842
Wait... Wait a second!

497
00:19:49,942 --> 00:19:50,942
Hm?

498
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:53,008
Um... this looks
like it's half.

499
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,542
I don't understand.

500
00:19:54,642 --> 00:19:57,575
I mean, shouldn't you
get a bigger share?

501
00:19:57,675 --> 00:19:58,808
Huh? But why?

502
00:19:58,908 --> 00:20:01,175
I couldn't have made
this much by myself, right?

503
00:20:01,275 --> 00:20:03,375
I mean, you're half
of the team.
Ah!

504
00:20:03,475 --> 00:20:06,375
You were a huge help,
Lili. Thank you.

505
00:20:06,475 --> 00:20:09,308
It's good to
have you on board.

506
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:11,675
Uh...

507
00:20:14,408 --> 00:20:16,408
(Chuckling)

508
00:20:17,408 --> 00:20:18,875
You're a weirdo.

509
00:20:18,975 --> 00:20:21,908
(Clang)
[SOMA GUILDSMAN]
It's only worth 12,000 valis?!

510
00:20:22,008 --> 00:20:25,575
Are you blind?!
Please tell me this is a joke!
(Sobbing)

511
00:20:25,675 --> 00:20:27,175
[MISHA]
Ugh, not this again.

512
00:20:27,275 --> 00:20:29,508
There's another one of the
Soma Familia members.

513
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:32,108
God... It's not
gonna be enough!

514
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,775
Just as unstable
as ever.

515
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:39,008
Bell, please do try to
be careful in there.

516
00:20:46,042 --> 00:20:48,275
(Rumbling)

517
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,075
(Crumbling rock)

518
00:20:50,175 --> 00:20:52,042
Here it comes.

519
00:20:52,142 --> 00:20:54,842
Riveria, please,
allow me to handle this.

520
00:21:08,075 --> 00:21:09,242
Hm.

521
00:21:11,275 --> 00:21:12,642
Ahh...

522
00:21:12,742 --> 00:21:14,108
(Swoon)

523
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,342
Oh, goodness.

524
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:16,508
I was going to sit back

525
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,508
and just watch for
a little while...

526
00:21:18,608 --> 00:21:21,742
but I simply cannot
help myself.

527
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:27,442
I must see
it emerge...

528
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:31,975
The power that now sleeps
so deeply within you...

529
00:21:32,908 --> 00:21:34,775
(Ending Song)

530
00:23:02,342 --> 00:23:05,808
(Street noise and footsteps)

531
00:23:05,908 --> 00:23:09,408
[HESTIA](Sigh)
Another day,
another valis...

532
00:23:09,508 --> 00:23:12,475
I mean, yeah, yeah I know
I owe her money and everything,

533
00:23:12,575 --> 00:23:15,608
but why does she have to work
a poor little Goddess so hard?

534
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:19,742
Hm... I sure wish Bell
was here with me.

535
00:23:19,842 --> 00:23:20,708
(Bell and Lili laugh)

536
00:23:20,808 --> 00:23:21,842
Huh?

537
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,075
(Hestia laughs)

538
00:23:24,175 --> 00:23:25,875
(Lili laughs)

539
00:23:25,975 --> 00:23:27,808
It is Bell!

540
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:28,775
Ugh!

541
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:33,375
(Bell and Lili laugh)

542
00:23:35,908 --> 00:23:38,708
AWHAAAAA!

543
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:42,475
[HESTIA]
How could he
cheat on me?!

544
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:49,308
[HESTIA]
Next time:
"Grimoire"
