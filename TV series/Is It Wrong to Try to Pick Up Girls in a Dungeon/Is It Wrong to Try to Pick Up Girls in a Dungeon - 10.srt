00:00:02,233 --> 00:00:04,833
[BELL]
Well, I'm off,
Goddess Hestia.

2
00:00:04,933 --> 00:00:07,300
Hm. You know what, Bell...

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,800
That salamander wool
is a lot more conspicuous

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,533
than I thought
it would be.

5
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:14,866
Well I'm gonna have to
be extra‐prepared

6
00:00:14,966 --> 00:00:16,266
for the middle floors.

7
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:18,300
Miss Eina would
have it no other way.

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,600
You're right, though,
it is a little bit flashy.

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,333
Yeah, well, if your advisor
suggested it to you...

10
00:00:24,433 --> 00:00:26,933
then I guess you should
probably listen.

11
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:28,433
And don't start pushing
yourself too hard

12
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:30,600
just because you're
level 2 now, okay?

13
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,000
Right!

14
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,266
Wish me luck!

15
00:00:37,866 --> 00:00:39,200

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,500
Ah.

Above all else, come back
in one piece,
Hm? Ah.

20
00:02:27,293 --> 00:02:29,460
you understand me?
[GROUP] Right!

21
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,460
[TAKE]
And Mikoto,
don't go crazy

22
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,360
just because
you've ranked up.
Sir!

23
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,860
[OUKA]
Thank you, Lord Takemikazuchi.
We're off then.

24
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,860
Hm.

25
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,393
[HESTIA]
Take?
Oh?

26
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,093
I take it those are the
children of your Familia?

27
00:02:42,193 --> 00:02:43,560
That's right,
they're mine.

28
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,460
[HESTIA]
Are they for
the middle floors?

29
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,126
[TAKE]
Yeah. Your Little Rookie's

30
00:02:47,226 --> 00:02:49,693
on his way down there
as well, isn't he?

31
00:02:49,793 --> 00:02:50,926
Yes, that he is.

32
00:02:51,026 --> 00:02:53,026
He's just
starting today.
Huh?

33
00:02:53,126 --> 00:02:55,860
He took off pretty
early this morning.

34
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,026
[TAKE]
Well, worrying about it
won't help anything.
Uh!

35
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:01,660
All we can do is
have faith in them.

36
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,660
Hm.

37
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,860
(Rumbling)
Oh?

38
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,293
[HESTIA]
That an earthquake?

39
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,626
(Birds chirp wildly)

40
00:03:06,726 --> 00:03:08,760
[TAKE]
Yes. We've had several lately.

41
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,160
[HESTIA]
Yes, we have.

42
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,560
And they seem to last longer
than they used to.

43
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,226
[HESTIA, THINKING]
You'll be okay. Right, Bell?

44
00:03:19,526 --> 00:03:21,426
Hmm...

45
00:03:21,926 --> 00:03:23,593

00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,760
Guh! Hng...

00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:34,693
Now take him out!

00:03:37,193 --> 00:03:38,893
YAAAH!

00:03:40,126 --> 00:03:41,693
Whoa!
(Laughs)

53
00:03:41,793 --> 00:03:45,493
Well, we survived our first
middle‐floor fight.

54
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:46,726
Not bad, huh?

55
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,260
[BELL]
Yeah! That wasn't
all that hard.

56
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,926
Even the fire attacks from
those Hell Hounds were
pretty easy to handle.

57
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,193
Uh‐huh.

58
00:03:55,293 --> 00:03:57,493
[LILI]
We need to find an open area.

59
00:03:57,593 --> 00:04:00,726
This isn't a good place to be
surrounded by monste‐

63
00:04:07,126 --> 00:04:08,493
[LILI]
They look like you.

64
00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:09,926
[WELF]
Hm. Little Bell‐bunnies.

65
00:04:10,026 --> 00:04:11,160
[BELL]
They're called
Al‐Mi'raj!

66
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,760

67
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,693
(Screeching)

68
00:04:14,793 --> 00:04:15,793
Bell's angry!

69
00:04:15,893 --> 00:04:18,026
Can you calm down
your little friends?

70
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:19,793
Agh! They have nothing
to do with me!

71
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:22,160
(Humming)

72
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,226
[ASFI]
You know, the other adventurers
are beginning to say

73
00:04:25,326 --> 00:04:27,526
some very nasty things about
that "Little Rookie" person.

74
00:04:27,626 --> 00:04:29,260
Hm? Hm...

75
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,060
[ASFI]
Well, he did kill a minotaur
single‐handed...

76
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,460
but they say that
he was using magic.

77
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,593
And that the Loki Familia
left it there for him.

78
00:04:37,693 --> 00:04:39,826
Even if he received
a blessing from a god...

79
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:42,793
S'no way he could've possibly
leveled up that easily.

80
00:04:42,893 --> 00:04:45,193
[ASFI]
Some have speculated
that he lied about

81
00:04:45,293 --> 00:04:47,093
how long it took
to rank up.

82
00:04:47,193 --> 00:04:50,860
[ASFI]
They don't believe he did it
faster than the Sword Princess.

83
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,593
They're so sensitive. Hm!

84
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:56,960
Still, the more I hear about
him, the more curious I get.

85
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,326
I can't wait
to meet this kid.

86
00:04:59,426 --> 00:05:02,260
What exactly do you have
planned, Master Hermes?

87
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,626
Why are you so interested
in that boy anyway?

88
00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:07,026
C'mon, what's wrong, Asfi?
You jealous?
(Annoyed grunt)

89
00:05:07,126 --> 00:05:11,360

What?! Look, I just
don't want to get into
any trouble, alright?

00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,426
Think of MY position

Mph!

All the members
appreciate you, Asfi.

93

You're the best leader a
Familia could ever ask for.

00:05:19,993 --> 00:05:23,426
You're so perfect, even your own
god depends on you, right?

I'm sorry, but we can't
afford to lose anybody.

There is no need for you

This is crazy.

Huh?

We're gonna have to run
through them, Mikoto.

Ugh! We can't do that!
They're in trouble‐

I'm not going to
hate you. I promise.

323
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,860
So, will you please help
bring my Bell back home?

324
00:14:29,693 --> 00:14:31,760
(Speechless gasps)

325
00:14:34,426 --> 00:14:36,526
[ALL]
As you command!

326
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,193
Oh...!

327
00:14:41,993 --> 00:14:43,460
[HEPHAISTOS]
You see, the thing is...

328
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,426
I really can't help you
much with a search party.

329
00:14:45,526 --> 00:14:47,226
I don't have any of
my best members.

330
00:14:47,326 --> 00:14:50,693
They're currently down in the
dungeon with the Loki Familia.

331
00:14:50,793 --> 00:14:54,493
I don't mind sending
Mikoto and Ouka down
to the middle floors.

332
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:59,326
[TAKE]
And Chigusa would probably
be fine as their supporter.

333
00:14:59,426 --> 00:15:01,860
I'm afraid the others
would just slow you down.

334
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,160
(Collective sigh)

335
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,226
[TAKE]
But three probably
won't be enough...

336
00:15:05,326 --> 00:15:07,793
[HERMES]
I'll help you
out, Hestia.
Ah!

337
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,093
Oh, hello, Hermes!

338
00:15:14,193 --> 00:15:15,660
[TAKE]
What are you doing here?

339
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,860
What about your journey?

340
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,593
[HERMES]
I came running
as soon as I heard

341
00:15:18,693 --> 00:15:21,226
my sweet friend Hestia
was in a tight spot.

342
00:15:21,326 --> 00:15:22,960
Why don't you take
a look at this:

343
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,693
I even put in a little
request for a search.
(Hestia gasps)

344
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,360
[HEPHAISTOS]
You say that she's
your friend...
[OTHERS] Huh?

345
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,393
and yet you've had absolutely
nothing to do with her

346
00:15:31,493 --> 00:15:33,226
since you got
to the lower world.

347
00:15:33,326 --> 00:15:34,926
[TAKE]
Well she does
have a point.

348
00:15:35,026 --> 00:15:38,060
[MIACH]
You've never seemed like
a very devoted friend of hers.

349
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,560
[HERMES]
Aw, come on now...

350
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,893
Man, you guys are
a tough crowd!

351
00:15:41,993 --> 00:15:43,326
(Grumbles)

352
00:15:43,426 --> 00:15:46,393
But still, I genuinely do
want to help Hestia.

353
00:15:46,493 --> 00:15:48,126
[HESTIA]
And I'd like to
save Bell,

354
00:15:48,226 --> 00:15:49,726
if I may.
(Pop)

355
00:15:49,826 --> 00:15:52,893
[HERMES]
So I've decide to let
Asfi here tag along.

356
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:53,760
Huh?!

357
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,093
She's my top dog,

358
00:15:55,193 --> 00:15:56,726
so we'll be just fine.

359
00:15:56,826 --> 00:15:58,560
(Sigh)

360
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,393
(Sad grunt)

361
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:02,493
[TAKE]
Well, it's
your call.

362
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:06,593
Rescuing Bell is my
number one priority.

363
00:16:06,693 --> 00:16:08,826
And the more help I get,
the better.

364
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,760
I accept your
offer, Hermes.

365
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,893
Good! You can
count on me.

366
00:16:12,993 --> 00:16:15,326
(Groan)

367
00:16:15,426 --> 00:16:17,693
[HEPHAISTOS]
We'll leave as soon as
everyone is ready.

368
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:19,593
[MIACH]
Let's aim for this
evening, shall we?

369
00:16:19,693 --> 00:16:22,126
[TAKE]
You three, make sure
you're prepared.

370
00:16:22,226 --> 00:16:23,193
[GROUP]
Sir!

371
00:16:23,293 --> 00:16:25,760
Okay Asfi,
what's wrong?

372
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,326
Tell me the truth.

373
00:16:27,426 --> 00:16:30,560
When you told everyone
"we'll be just fine" earlier...

374
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,226
Don't tell me...

375
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:33,860
[HERMES]
That's right...
I'm going with you.

376
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,860
UH! Hermes, gods are not
permitted inside the dungeon!

377
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,693
Look nobody needs to know.

378
00:16:39,793 --> 00:16:42,760
Just be sure not to make any
mistakes... it'll work out.

379
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,026
(Sigh)
Oh?

380
00:16:44,126 --> 00:16:45,560
You planned this
from the start,

381
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,526
didn't you?

382
00:16:46,626 --> 00:16:47,126
(Pop)

383
00:16:47,226 --> 00:16:48,526
(Laughs)

384
00:16:48,626 --> 00:16:50,293
(Pop pop)
You just focus on
protecting me, okay?

385
00:16:50,393 --> 00:16:51,593
[HESTIA]
You're taking me
with you!

386
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:52,760
[BOTH]
Hestia?!

387
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,326
[HERMES]
Don't be absurd!

388
00:16:54,426 --> 00:16:56,260
(Whistle)
Gods aren't allowed
inside the dungeon.

389
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,093
You know that...
That's preposterous!

390
00:16:58,193 --> 00:16:59,826
We'll have to
keep it a secret!

391
00:16:59,926 --> 00:17:01,093
Uuhh!

392
00:17:01,193 --> 00:17:04,060
I am going in with you
to save Bell.

393
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,826
There's something not right just
leaving it up to somebody else.

394
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:09,693
So I'm going to help too!

395
00:17:09,793 --> 00:17:11,860
You understand?

396
00:17:13,226 --> 00:17:14,560
Ugh...

397
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,526
[HEPHAISTOS]
Um... Hestia...
[ALL] Huh?

398
00:17:16,626 --> 00:17:20,160
[TAKE]
Forgive me. We are
to blame for this.

399
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,626
[HESTIA]
Oh, forget about that.

400
00:17:26,226 --> 00:17:27,626
I can sense him.

401
00:17:28,693 --> 00:17:31,826
[HESTIA]
I'm certain that
Bell is still alive.

402
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,893
The blessing that I
gave him hasn't faded yet.

403
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,626
(Collective chuckle)

404
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,460
[HEPHAISTOS]
Hestia?
Oh?

405
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,826
If you happen to
run into Welf...

406
00:17:44,926 --> 00:17:46,560
could you give him
something for me?

407
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,126
[HEPHAISTOS]
Along with a little message.

408
00:17:49,226 --> 00:17:50,360
If you don't mind.

409
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,593
[HESTIA]
Of course I can.

410
00:17:52,693 --> 00:17:55,093
[HERMES]
Asfi, I'm afraid
I have to ask.

411
00:17:55,193 --> 00:17:58,260
Can you protect both
me AND Hestia?

412
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,293
Well, I can't
guarantee anything.

413
00:18:01,393 --> 00:18:03,093
That's a problem.

414
00:18:03,193 --> 00:18:06,460
[HERMES]
Shall we enlist
one more, then?

415
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,260
(Heavy sigh)

416
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:18,793
Ugh!
(Coughs)

417
00:18:18,893 --> 00:18:20,193
(Forcefully clearing throat)

418
00:18:20,293 --> 00:18:21,326
(Lili sighs)

419
00:18:21,426 --> 00:18:22,693
[WELF]
Please, Little Bit!

420
00:18:22,793 --> 00:18:25,026
Can you please do
something about that smell?

421
00:18:25,126 --> 00:18:27,193
[LILI]
Oh, just shut up!

422
00:18:27,293 --> 00:18:28,826
How do you think I feel,
you jerk?!

423
00:18:28,926 --> 00:18:31,126
I'm the one
who's holding it!
[BOTH] GAH!

424
00:18:31,226 --> 00:18:33,593
[LILI]
Why don't you try carrying
it, Master Welf?!
I'm sorry!

425
00:18:33,693 --> 00:18:35,526
[BELL] Please, have mercy on us.
[LILI] You think you're the
only one who doesn't like it?!

426
00:18:35,626 --> 00:18:38,093
How dare you complain to me!
AH!

427
00:18:38,193 --> 00:18:41,026
This stink‐bag is our
last hope for survival.

428
00:18:41,126 --> 00:18:42,993
As long as it keeps on
smelling disgusting,

429
00:18:43,093 --> 00:18:45,593
hopefully it'll keep
the monsters from
trying to attack us.

430
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:48,960
[WELF]
I understand that,
but... Guh...

431
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,693
We just have to
deal with it.

432
00:18:50,793 --> 00:18:51,660
Huh?

433
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,193
(Growling)

434
00:18:53,293 --> 00:18:54,926
Let me get
this one.

435
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:57,760
Ignite, Heretic Spell!

436
00:18:58,393 --> 00:19:00,393
Will o' the Wisp!

437
00:19:00,926 --> 00:19:04,660
(Whistling winds)

438
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,493
(Heavy explosion)

439
00:19:08,593 --> 00:19:10,160
[ALL]
Guh!

440
00:19:13,326 --> 00:19:15,426
Wow, that's
a great spell!

441
00:19:15,526 --> 00:19:18,926
I assume it uses the enemy's own
magic to make it self‐destruct.

442
00:19:19,026 --> 00:19:22,160
Yeah, and well, I never
knew when I was going
to have to actually

443
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,326
break it out
and use it.

444
00:19:24,426 --> 00:19:25,693
Are you okay, though?

445
00:19:25,793 --> 00:19:28,393
You've been casting
that same spell a lot.

446
00:19:28,493 --> 00:19:31,826
Don't you worry.
I'll be fine.

447
00:19:31,926 --> 00:19:33,826
(Weak laugh)

448
00:19:33,926 --> 00:19:35,626
(Worried sighs)

449
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,626
[FREYA]
Just what are you plotting?

450
00:19:42,226 --> 00:19:45,126
[FREYA]
Ah. 'Tis no matter.

451
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,093
But know this:

452
00:19:47,193 --> 00:19:49,960
The only one who gets
to toy with him...

453
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,626
...is me.

454
00:19:51,726 --> 00:19:53,860
(Rumbling)

455
00:19:56,693 --> 00:19:57,760
[BELL]
Lili...?

456
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,093
[LILI]
Yeah.

457
00:19:59,193 --> 00:20:01,560
we're all outta
the stinky stuff.

458
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:06,926
(Heavy footsteps)
(Snarling)

459
00:20:07,026 --> 00:20:10,626
(Scared gasps)

460
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:11,960
You are kidding me.

461
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,293
This isn't
funny anymore!

462
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:16,960
I mean,
what the hell?!

463
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,760
(Loud roar)

464
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,626
HNG! YAAAH!

465
00:20:22,026 --> 00:20:23,060
YAH! Guh!

466
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,060
HNNGG!

467
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,693
(Minotaur roars in pain)

468
00:20:31,026 --> 00:20:32,593
YAAH!

469
00:20:32,693 --> 00:20:34,826
HAH! HYAH!

470
00:20:37,626 --> 00:20:39,693
AGH!

471
00:20:42,126 --> 00:20:43,693
[WELF]
Jesus H...

472
00:20:43,793 --> 00:20:44,293
(Bell grunts)

473
00:20:44,393 --> 00:20:46,993
(Snarling)

474
00:20:47,093 --> 00:20:48,560
What the...?

475
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,726
Ah!

476
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,926
AAGGHH!

00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,826

[WELF, THINKING]
Damn...

482
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,360
(Panting)
This guy really
did beat a Minotaur

483
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,160
when he was only level 1!

484
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,293
Ugh!

Master Bell!

Okay.
Everyone ready?

Uh‐huh!

Good, then let's go find
Bell and his party‐

[MIKOTO]
Wait, who's that?

495
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,926
Why is she here?

496
00:23:34,026 --> 00:23:35,893
No need to
fret, darling.
Huh?

497
00:23:35,993 --> 00:23:37,560
She's here to help.

Hm.

Alright!

00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:43,793
Don't worry, Bell,
