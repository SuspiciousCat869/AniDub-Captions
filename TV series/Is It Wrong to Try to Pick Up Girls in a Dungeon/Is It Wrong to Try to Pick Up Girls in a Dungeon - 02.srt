1
00:00:01,702 --> 00:00:04,302
(Mystical whirring)

2
00:00:04,402 --> 00:00:05,736
Huh?

3
00:00:05,836 --> 00:00:08,402
Is something wrong,
Goddess Hestia?

4
00:00:08,502 --> 00:00:11,169
[HESTIA]
Uh, no! Not at all.

5
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:14,236
[HESTIA, THINKING]
He's growing too quickly.

6
00:00:17,069 --> 00:00:20,236
I know what happened was
out of the ordinary, but...

7
00:00:21,202 --> 00:00:23,869
That's not enough
to explain this.

8
00:00:24,402 --> 00:00:25,936
So it MUST be...

9
00:00:26,036 --> 00:00:28,902
this rare Skill
I've never heard of!

10
00:00:29,536 --> 00:00:30,936
Realis Phrase!

11
00:00:31,036 --> 00:00:32,969
Thanks a lot,
Wallen‐whatser‐whatever...

12
00:00:33,069 --> 00:00:36,036
(Flaming sound)
The Skill causes a rapid
increase in growth rate

13
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,036
as long as he maintains
his feelings,

14
00:00:38,136 --> 00:00:41,302
and it accelerates depending
on how strong they are.

15
00:00:41,402 --> 00:00:43,636
Well isn't that SO nice for you?

16
00:00:43,736 --> 00:00:46,536
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
You pervert! Miscreant!
Scoundrel! Philanderer!

17
00:00:46,636 --> 00:00:51,802
[HESTIA, THINKING]
Still, I wonder if I should
tell Bell about all this...

18
00:00:51,902 --> 00:00:55,236
[BELL]
I want... to be strong.

19
00:00:55,336 --> 00:00:59,136
[HESTIA, THINKING]
The other gods are
gonna want him now.

20
00:00:59,236 --> 00:01:01,302
No. I can't tell him.

21
00:01:01,402 --> 00:01:03,269
Hey, Bell?

22
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:07,036
Can I just tell you what
your Status is today?

23
00:01:07,136 --> 00:01:08,369
Uh, okay.

24
00:01:15,602 --> 00:01:17,069
[HESTIA, THINKING]
Well, maybe I can....

25
00:01:17,169 --> 00:01:20,669
Maybe I'll just give him
a little push!

26
00:01:21,302 --> 00:01:23,136
(Opening song)

27
00:02:55,264 --> 00:02:56,230
(Birds chirping)

28
00:02:56,346 --> 00:02:57,179
[BELL]
What?!

29
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:58,713
You mean to tell me
that my Status

30
00:02:58,813 --> 00:03:00,279
really went up
by that much?!

31
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:01,513
Yes.

32
00:03:01,613 --> 00:03:04,413
Right now, you're improving
at an incredible pace.

33
00:03:04,513 --> 00:03:07,013
It's almost like
a growth spurt.

34
00:03:07,113 --> 00:03:08,279
[BELL]
Okay.

35
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:09,979
Understand that this
is nothing

36
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:11,379
but my own
personal opinion...

37
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,713
but I think you have
a natural talent for this.

38
00:03:13,813 --> 00:03:16,346
(Chuckles)
[HESTIA]
You're getting stronger.

39
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:20,279
And you have a serious desire
to get stronger as well.

40
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:22,279
I do.

41
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:25,146
I respect your wishes,
okay, Bell?

42
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:28,913
Whatever I can do to help you...
I will do it.

43
00:03:29,013 --> 00:03:31,646
But...
But don't push it too hard.

44
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:33,546
Please promise me you won't.

45
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:37,613
I'm begging you Bell,
do NOT leave me all alone.

46
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:42,413
Okay.
I promise you.

47
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:45,346
I'm going to work really
hard to get stronger...

48
00:03:45,446 --> 00:03:47,713
but I will never leave
you alone, Goddess.

49
00:03:47,813 --> 00:03:50,446
[BELL]
You don't have to
worry about that.

50
00:03:50,546 --> 00:03:53,046
Well that makes me feel
a whole lot better.

51
00:03:53,146 --> 00:03:55,446
Oh and just so you know...

52
00:03:55,546 --> 00:03:58,179
I'll be gone for the next
two or three days, okay?

53
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,079
Uh... You what?

54
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:04,179
(Giggling)

55
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,679
[BELL]
I'm so, so, so sorry!

56
00:04:08,779 --> 00:04:12,346
I swear I never meant to run off
without paying the other night!

57
00:04:12,446 --> 00:04:15,679
Here, this is
what I owe.

58
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:18,079
Well I do appreciate you
goin' through so much

59
00:04:18,179 --> 00:04:19,479
trouble to bring me this.

60
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:20,179
Yeah...

61
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,346
because if you hadn't,

62
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:22,913
I would've had to come
find your ass

63
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,279
and collect on the
payment myself!

64
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:26,946
AH! I really
am sorry!

65
00:04:27,046 --> 00:04:29,146
Uh, you can stop
apologizing now, Bell.

66
00:04:29,246 --> 00:04:33,313
But I'm glad you stopped by.
It's nice to see you again.

67
00:04:33,413 --> 00:04:36,513
I take it you're off
to the dungeon today?

68
00:04:36,613 --> 00:04:38,046
Take this.
It's lunch.

69
00:04:38,146 --> 00:04:40,779
[BELL]
Oh, no.
No I can't...

70
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:41,879
Really?
Why not?

71
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:44,513
I want you to.

72
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:46,079
Ahhh...

73
00:04:46,179 --> 00:04:48,413
[BELL]
Well okay...
thanks.

74
00:04:48,513 --> 00:04:50,046
(Syr giggles)

75
00:04:50,146 --> 00:04:51,913
You're lucky Syr
likes you.

76
00:04:52,013 --> 00:04:53,679
And you should know, kid...

77
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:57,113
the only reason me and
the others forgave your
little indiscretion...

78
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:00,179
is because she begged
and begged us to.

79
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,746
She really
did that?

80
00:05:01,846 --> 00:05:03,113
You listen here...

81
00:05:03,213 --> 00:05:05,146
adventurers don't get
too far in life

82
00:05:05,246 --> 00:05:07,246
tryin' to act
all cool and crap.

83
00:05:07,346 --> 00:05:08,679
Focus on staying alive.

84
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:10,879
Do that before you start
gettin' fancy.
[BELL] Huh?

85
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,879
[MIA]
Even if an adventurer looks weak
and people make fun of 'em,

86
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:17,413
it's the ones who come back
in one piece that are the
real winners.

87
00:05:17,513 --> 00:05:18,246
[BELL]
UH!

88
00:05:18,346 --> 00:05:19,813
[MIA]
So be careful.

89
00:05:19,913 --> 00:05:21,679
Ah I won't nag ya too much...

90
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,913
but if you go and get yourself
killed I'll very disappointed.

91
00:05:25,013 --> 00:05:26,913
Now... hop on
outta here!
[BELL] AH!

92
00:05:27,013 --> 00:05:28,779
You're just getting
in the way anyway!

93
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:29,713
Right!

94
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:31,746
[BELL]
See you later!

95
00:05:32,913 --> 00:05:34,346
(Mia chuckles)

96
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:38,613
[SYR, THINKING]
Come back soon.

97
00:05:39,446 --> 00:05:40,879
(Chuckling)

98
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:42,746
[BELL, THINKING]
That kinda felt like...

99
00:05:42,846 --> 00:05:44,713
I was leaving home
or something.

100
00:05:44,813 --> 00:05:47,746
(Untuned trumpet sound)

101
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,113
[GANESHA]
Hello and welcome!

102
00:05:51,213 --> 00:05:53,346
Thank you all
for attending!

103
00:05:53,446 --> 00:05:54,113
(Hearty laugh)

104
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:56,313
It is I! Lord Ganesha!

105
00:05:56,413 --> 00:05:59,179
Seeing so many of my dearest
acquaintances and colleagues
at this gathering tonight...

106
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:01,213
[GOD 1]
Dude, how many
centuries has it been?

107
00:06:01,313 --> 00:06:03,613
[GANESHA] ...fills me with the
deepest gratitude
[GOD 2]
Uh, four days?

108
00:06:03,713 --> 00:06:07,013
Hey... who's that doofus
over there with the
stupid fake smile?

109
00:06:07,113 --> 00:06:08,679
[GOD 3]
Takemikazuchi?

110
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:10,013
[GOD 1]
Yeah and there's Hermes.

111
00:06:10,113 --> 00:06:12,813
Guess he's back from
his trip. Finally.

112
00:06:12,913 --> 00:06:15,646
Oh, check it out.
There she is!

113
00:06:15,746 --> 00:06:17,446
[GOD 1]
The Goddess of Beauty.

114
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,713
[ALL]
Freya!

115
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,646
Oh?
(Giggles)

116
00:06:22,746 --> 00:06:26,046
[GOD 1]
Oh man, she makes me
feel... funny.

117
00:06:28,413 --> 00:06:30,113
Good evening
to you, Hestia.

118
00:06:30,213 --> 00:06:31,279
[HESTIA]
EEK!

119
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,613
[HESTIA]
Freya.

120
00:06:33,713 --> 00:06:35,146
I'm sorry,
you busy?

121
00:06:35,246 --> 00:06:37,813
[HESTIA]
I'm always too busy
to deal with you.

122
00:06:37,913 --> 00:06:39,346
Oh?
(Laughs)

123
00:06:39,446 --> 00:06:41,946
That is the kind of thing that
makes me like you so much.

124
00:06:42,046 --> 00:06:46,446
Well, at least you're not quite
as unbearable as SOME people.

125
00:06:46,546 --> 00:06:48,646
[LOKI]
It's Freya!

126
00:06:48,746 --> 00:06:49,813
And Shrimpy!

127
00:06:49,913 --> 00:06:51,013
Well, hello,
Loki.

128
00:06:51,113 --> 00:06:53,679
Oh great, what are
YOU doing here?

129
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:56,413
Sweetie, you know me,
I'm doing whatever I want.

130
00:06:56,513 --> 00:06:58,413
Gah!
[LOKI]
I'm Loki.

131
00:06:58,513 --> 00:06:59,213
(Coughs)

132
00:06:59,313 --> 00:07:01,279
Actually, this is perfect.

133
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,946
So... I've been meaning
to ask you something.

134
00:07:04,046 --> 00:07:06,613
Yeah?
What is it pee‐wee?

135
00:07:06,713 --> 00:07:08,046
(Grimace)

136
00:07:08,146 --> 00:07:10,113
Yeah, that
sword princess...

137
00:07:10,213 --> 00:07:11,646
Wallen‐watser‐butt or whatever,

138
00:07:11,746 --> 00:07:14,346
well I just wanted to know
if she's, like, got a partner.

139
00:07:14,446 --> 00:07:18,279
What? Excuse me?
She's my favorite human.

140
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:20,179
Any guy who looks at her...

141
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:22,213
gets torn to shreds!

142
00:07:22,313 --> 00:07:22,846
Ugh...

143
00:07:22,946 --> 00:07:23,913
(Both growling)

144
00:07:24,013 --> 00:07:25,646
You two kids
get along so well.

145
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:26,646
[BOTH]
No we don't!

146
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:27,879
[FREYA]
Oh and uh, Loki,

147
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:29,513
I can't help but notice
you seem to be

148
00:07:29,613 --> 00:07:31,679
looking a little differently
than usual today.

149
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:34,813
You wouldn't normally be
seen in such glamorous attire.
[HESTIA] AH!

150
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,646
Oh this?
Well I heard that a certain

151
00:07:36,746 --> 00:07:39,079
little, itsy‐bitsy, teeny guest
was coming tonight...

152
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:43,379
...I wanted to look my best
to mock her for being too
poor to buy a real dress.

153
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:45,846
[HESTIA]
Ha! That's real
funny, Loki.

154
00:07:45,946 --> 00:07:48,813
'Cause I'm over here having a
good old belly laugh myself.

155
00:07:48,913 --> 00:07:49,979
[LOKI]
No don't.

156
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,346
Seriously...
(Loki gasps)

157
00:07:51,446 --> 00:07:53,613
you showed up to
the party without any boobs!

158
00:07:53,713 --> 00:07:56,179
(Loki screams)
(Hestia echoes and laughs)

159
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,346
[HESTIA]
No boobs!

160
00:07:57,446 --> 00:07:59,846
(Hestia laughs)
(Jiggling noises)

161
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,679
[Loki]
Grrr....

162
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:03,413
[HESTIA]
No boobs!

163
00:08:06,246 --> 00:08:09,146
(Gear clattering)

164
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:12,279
(Crowd chatter)

165
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:18,179
[BELL, THINKING]
Everybody here has
such expensive stuff.

166
00:08:20,913 --> 00:08:22,446
[MAN 1]
It's that time again, huh?

167
00:08:22,546 --> 00:08:25,913
[MAN 2]
Monsterphilia... has it
really been a year already?

168
00:08:26,013 --> 00:08:27,846
[HESTIA]
Lemme go!

169
00:08:27,946 --> 00:08:30,546
[LOKI]
Well, aren't you just the
sweetest little thing?

170
00:08:30,646 --> 00:08:33,746
(Crowd cheering)
[GOD 1]
Aw, yeah! Now this is
what I call a show!

171
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,979
(Hesita struggling)
[GOD 2]
The Title Bout! Short and Busty
versus Tall and Flat!

172
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:39,179
(Loki laughing)
[GOD 3]
I bet 10 valis on
Short and Busty.

173
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,546
[GOD 1]
I got ten on the
tall flat one

174
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:42,346
making a stupid mistake
at the last minute!

175
00:08:42,446 --> 00:08:44,846
[GOD 2]
And I'll wager all I got
that I'll be right there

176
00:08:44,946 --> 00:08:46,879
to comfort Loki
when she loses...

177
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:48,646
[GOD 1]
I'll take that bet!
(Laughs)

178
00:08:48,746 --> 00:08:49,946
[HESTIA]
Awwww....

179
00:08:50,046 --> 00:08:51,446
[LOKI]
I'll let you off
easy today!

180
00:08:51,546 --> 00:08:53,346
I dunno Loki,
your chest is so flat

181
00:08:53,446 --> 00:08:56,279
I might mistake you for
a guy next time I see you!

182
00:08:56,379 --> 00:08:58,679
Oh, shut your
fat face! Ugh!

183
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:00,946
[HEPHAISTOS]
You two are at it
again, I see.

184
00:09:01,046 --> 00:09:03,213
[HESTIA]
Ah! Hephaistos!

185
00:09:03,313 --> 00:09:05,079
Oh, I'm so glad
you're here!

186
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:06,546
I've missed you!

187
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:07,646
What, you missed me?

188
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:10,013
Let me be blunt,
if it's money you're after,

189
00:09:10,113 --> 00:09:11,813
you're not getting
a single valis from me.

190
00:09:11,913 --> 00:09:13,013
Excuse me!

191
00:09:13,113 --> 00:09:14,413
Do I look like the
kind of goddess

192
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,613
who'd stoop so low to go
fishing for handouts

193
00:09:16,713 --> 00:09:17,913
from her best friend?!

194
00:09:18,013 --> 00:09:19,479
Y'know, you've got a lot
of nerve saying that

195
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:21,779
after the way you've
freeloaded off my Familia!

196
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:22,946
(Hestia gasps)

197
00:09:23,046 --> 00:09:24,213
And then you come
to me crying about

198
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,546
how you were broke
and had no family left

199
00:09:25,646 --> 00:09:27,813
after I had to
kick you out!
[HESTIA]
UGH!

200
00:09:27,913 --> 00:09:30,679
Do you honestly wonder why I
would assume you want something?

201
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,379
AAHHH!
(Freya giggles)

202
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:35,113
[HESTIA]
Okay so maybe I USED
to do that.

203
00:09:35,213 --> 00:09:36,979
But not anymore!

204
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:40,379
Because I've got
my OWN Familia now!

205
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:43,713
Oh, yes, of course.
That "Bell" person, right?

206
00:09:43,813 --> 00:09:46,713
The silly little boy with the
white hair and red eyes.

207
00:09:46,813 --> 00:09:48,246
Well, deusdea DO change

208
00:09:48,346 --> 00:09:50,779
when they get their
own Familia.
(Man whispering)

209
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,013
Hephaistos, Hestia...

210
00:09:53,113 --> 00:09:54,979
I'm afraid I must
be on my way.

211
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:56,346
Leaving
so soon?

212
00:09:56,446 --> 00:09:58,379
Oh yes. I was wanting to
check up on something,

213
00:09:58,479 --> 00:09:59,613
but, uh...

214
00:09:59,713 --> 00:10:01,713
there's no time
for that now.
[HESTIA] Huh?

215
00:10:01,813 --> 00:10:05,179
Besides I think all the men
have had plenty of time
to take me all in.

216
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,679
(Crowd groans and murmurs)

217
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:10,346
[FREYA]
Toodle‐oo!

218
00:10:10,446 --> 00:10:11,379
Uh...

219
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:13,179
[HEPHAISTOS]
Well? So tell me,

220
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,846
what is it you wanted to
talk with me about then?

221
00:10:14,946 --> 00:10:16,046
Ah!

222
00:10:16,146 --> 00:10:17,179
And keep in mind,

223
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,313
depending on
what it is,

224
00:10:18,413 --> 00:10:19,913
I may never speak
to you again.

225
00:10:20,013 --> 00:10:22,246
Uh... yeah I get it.

226
00:10:22,346 --> 00:10:24,213
Here it goes!
[HEPHAISTOS] EH?!

227
00:10:24,313 --> 00:10:29,446
[HESTIA]
I want you to make
a weapon for Bell! Please!

228
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:32,646
(Sigh)

229
00:10:32,746 --> 00:10:33,746
Hello there, Bell.

230
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:35,746
Uh! Lord Miach!
I'm sorry...

231
00:10:35,846 --> 00:10:37,279
I can't actually
buy one.

232
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:38,346
(Laughs)

233
00:10:38,446 --> 00:10:40,413
There's no need for
you to apologize.

234
00:10:40,513 --> 00:10:42,746
Hey, wait a second, shouldn't
you be at that big party

235
00:10:42,846 --> 00:10:44,679
with all the other gods?

236
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:46,379
Hm. I did get an invitation

237
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,079
and was actually
planning to go...

238
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:50,079
but I'm afraid
I'm far too busy.

239
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:52,913
I mean I have to support
my Familia, don't I?

240
00:10:53,013 --> 00:10:54,879
Anyway, here,
these are for you.

241
00:10:54,979 --> 00:10:55,979
Huh?

242
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,646
Oh no! I can't take those!

243
00:10:57,746 --> 00:11:00,813
Just consider it a small
token of my many thanks.

244
00:11:00,913 --> 00:11:02,579
And an open door to
keep doing business

245
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:03,713
with my Familia.

246
00:11:03,813 --> 00:11:05,779
Uh... thanks a lot.

247
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:08,413
[MIACH]
You take care, Bell.

248
00:11:08,513 --> 00:11:10,113
Hm.

249
00:11:14,746 --> 00:11:18,013
[HEPHAISTOS]
Um, how long do you
plan to keep doing that?

250
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,679
I'm busy. And to be
quite honest with you...

251
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:28,179
you being here is a rather
annoying distraction.

252
00:11:29,113 --> 00:11:30,913
(Hephaistos sighs)

253
00:11:31,013 --> 00:11:32,913
(Crowd gasps)

254
00:11:33,013 --> 00:11:34,913
[HEPHAISTOS]
This is absurd.

255
00:11:35,013 --> 00:11:37,313
I don't mean to sound
pompous or anything,

256
00:11:37,413 --> 00:11:39,546
but you don't have any idea
what I normally charge

257
00:11:39,646 --> 00:11:41,113
for a custom job, do you?

258
00:11:41,213 --> 00:11:43,946
I know it's a lot
to ask... but I‐

259
00:11:44,046 --> 00:11:46,013
Come up with
the money first...

260
00:11:46,113 --> 00:11:48,313
and then
we can talk.

261
00:11:48,913 --> 00:11:49,846
Ah!

262
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:51,079
(Hephaistos groans)

263
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:53,146
[HESTIA]
It has to be now!

264
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:56,746
Please help me, Hephaistos!
I beg you!

265
00:11:56,846 --> 00:11:59,179
Oh, my...

266
00:12:00,746 --> 00:12:01,913
[HEPHAISTOS]
Listen Hestia,

267
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,213
I don't know what
you're doing exactly,

268
00:12:03,313 --> 00:12:04,946
but could you please
knock it off?

269
00:12:05,046 --> 00:12:06,479
[HESTIA]
Ugh. It's called groveling.

270
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:09,046
Takemikazuchi says it's the
ultimate strategy

271
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:10,446
for asking a favor.

272
00:12:10,546 --> 00:12:12,613
[HEPHAISTOS]
Ugh, he's always
getting into things

273
00:12:12,713 --> 00:12:13,979
where he doesn't belong.

274
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,246
Tell me...

275
00:12:15,346 --> 00:12:17,446
Why do you want this
so badly, Hestia?

276
00:12:17,546 --> 00:12:19,746
[HESTIA]
I am trying to
help Bell, okay?

277
00:12:19,846 --> 00:12:21,979
He's been so
different lately!

278
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,846
He's got a single
goal on his mind.

279
00:12:23,946 --> 00:12:25,379
He's running straight
towards it

280
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:27,746
and will stop at
absolutely nothing!

281
00:12:27,846 --> 00:12:29,546
And it's a dangerous path.

282
00:12:29,646 --> 00:12:32,646
That's why I want to
give him strength!

283
00:12:32,746 --> 00:12:35,413
(Crying)
He needs a weapon
that can clear the way!

284
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,213
All I want to do
is help him...

285
00:12:38,313 --> 00:12:41,146
[HESTIA]
and do whatever I can
to support him.

286
00:12:41,246 --> 00:12:43,446
[HESTIA]
Even though I'm his goddess,

287
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:46,479
I haven't been able to do
one godly thing for him!

288
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:47,813
(Sobbing)

289
00:12:47,913 --> 00:12:49,946
I feel so useless....

290
00:12:50,046 --> 00:12:51,013
I hate it.

291
00:12:51,113 --> 00:12:53,513
I hate it, I hate it!

292
00:12:53,613 --> 00:12:55,579
Guess you HAVE
changed.

293
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,679
Well...

294
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:58,046
[HEPAISTOS]
Alright, then.

295
00:12:58,146 --> 00:12:59,079
HUH!

296
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,113
In that case...

297
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:01,879
I'll do it then.

298
00:13:01,979 --> 00:13:03,979
If it truly means
that much to you.

299
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,113
(Speechless)

300
00:13:05,213 --> 00:13:07,413
Thank you so much,
Hephaistos!

301
00:13:07,513 --> 00:13:08,979
[HESTIA]
Wah. Ah!

302
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,346
But I'm warning you...

303
00:13:10,446 --> 00:13:12,779
you ARE going to pay
me back for this.

304
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:15,679
No matter how many eternities
it takes, understand?

305
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:18,079
Mm. I promise!

306
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:19,279
(Metallic clang)

307
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:21,046
So what kind of weapon
does he prefer?

308
00:13:21,146 --> 00:13:22,746
Well,
a knife, but...

309
00:13:22,846 --> 00:13:24,613
[HESTIA]
Ah! Oh wow...

310
00:13:24,713 --> 00:13:27,913
are you gonna hammer it out
yourself, Hephaistos?!

311
00:13:28,013 --> 00:13:29,246
Well, of course I am.

312
00:13:29,346 --> 00:13:30,846
But this is just between
you and me, alright?

313
00:13:30,946 --> 00:13:33,979
I do not want my Familia to
get mixed up in any of this.

314
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,279
Awesome!

315
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:37,079
The one‐and‐only
heavenly goddess

316
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:40,246
known as the Divine Artisan
is creating a weapon for me!

317
00:13:40,346 --> 00:13:42,146
What, you didn't
forget, did you?

318
00:13:42,246 --> 00:13:44,246
We're not in Heaven
anymore, Hestia.

319
00:13:44,346 --> 00:13:46,146
That means we're not able
to use our divine powers

320
00:13:46,246 --> 00:13:47,946
for any reason, remember?

321
00:13:48,046 --> 00:13:49,446
Who cares?!

322
00:13:49,546 --> 00:13:52,613
As long as you're the one
making it, I'm super excited!

You'll need to be
my assistant.

326

your hands dirty.

Sure! Whatever you need!

[HEPHAISTOS, THINKING]
A first class weapon
for some boy

329
00:14:08,046 --> 00:14:10,313
who's only been adventuring
for half a month.

330
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:12,746
Ugh...

331
00:14:12,846 --> 00:14:15,413
Okay then...
let's get started.

She said she'd be gone
for two or three days.

333

So. Maybe she'll be
coming back today...

Hey!
Huh?

00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:30,013
I've been waiting
for you, nyaa!

336
00:14:30,113 --> 00:14:31,613
I need a favor!

337
00:14:31,713 --> 00:14:32,613
What?

338
00:14:32,713 --> 00:14:34,846
Oh... uh,
good myorning!

00:14:34,946 --> 00:14:36,646
Ah, good morning
to you too...

[ANYA]
Nyanyway...

00:14:38,446 --> 00:14:40,213
Could you like, y'know,
take this purrrse

342
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:42,679
to that silly Syr
purrson, nya?

343
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,679
[BELL]
Uh yeah...
I'm sorry.

344
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:46,979
I still don't understand
what you're trying to say.
[ANYA] Nya?

345
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:48,179
Hmm...

346
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,713
[RYU]
You should really
work on your

347
00:14:49,813 --> 00:14:51,179
communication skills, Anya.

348
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,646
I think you're
confusing Mr. Cranel.

349
00:14:53,746 --> 00:14:55,146
Oh come on, Ryu.

350
00:14:55,246 --> 00:14:57,946
I just told him to take
this purse to Syr, nya,

351
00:14:58,046 --> 00:15:00,146
because she scurried off
to Monsterphilia so fast

352
00:15:00,246 --> 00:15:01,946
that she totally
furrgot it, nya.

353
00:15:02,046 --> 00:15:03,613
What's nyot
to understand?

354
00:15:03,713 --> 00:15:04,879
Did you get
all of that?

355
00:15:04,979 --> 00:15:06,546
Oh, okay.

356
00:15:06,646 --> 00:15:09,379
Syr took the day off so she'd be
able to go see the festival.

357
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:11,713
In fact, she was so
excited about going...

358
00:15:11,813 --> 00:15:14,513
I doubt if she's even noticed
she doesn't have it yet.

359
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,946
Anyway, we really
appreciate this.

00:15:22,346 --> 00:15:24,579
so what's this Monsterphilia
thingy again?

364
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:27,679
(Crowd cheering

Monsterphilia is
a huge festival!

It's really something special.

They take over the arena for the
entire day...

368
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,146
and train monsters
they captured in the dungeon.

369
00:15:41,246 --> 00:15:43,679

[LOKI]
What are you up to
this time?

374
00:16:00,513 --> 00:16:03,646
Some kid from another

00:16:03,746 --> 00:16:05,779
so you're trying to
steal him for yourself?

Jeez. You stir up trouble

Thank you so much!

Is it okay if I, like,
give it to him right away?

389

Give it to him
whenever you want,

forget about what you owe me.

exactly, anyway?

Weak... Unreliable...
an easy crier.

But he's pretty. And his
aura is transparent.

A color like I've
never seen before.

Finding him was quite
the coincidence.
