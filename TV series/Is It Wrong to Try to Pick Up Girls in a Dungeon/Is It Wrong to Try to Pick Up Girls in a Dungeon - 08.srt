Were you ever an
adventurer, Miss Ryu?

52
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:05,921
[RYU]
Well... I was once.
Why do you ask?

53
00:04:06,021 --> 00:04:09,588
[BELL]
I was wondering, what should I
be doing to make my level go up?

54
00:04:09,688 --> 00:04:11,754
Do I just need to keep
fighting monsters?

55
00:04:11,854 --> 00:04:14,654
No, that's not going
to be enough.

56
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,521
There's a lot more to it.

57
00:04:16,621 --> 00:04:18,988
And actually, you'll need
to conquer one of the

58
00:04:19,088 --> 00:04:20,254
more powerful enemies.

59
00:04:20,354 --> 00:04:22,321
Huh? Do you really
think I can do that?

60
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:23,988
[RYU]
It's not going
to be easy.

61
00:04:24,088 --> 00:04:26,254
But you'll have better luck
with the right skills

62
00:04:26,354 --> 00:04:27,921
and a proper strategy.

63
00:04:28,021 --> 00:04:28,954
Huh?

64
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:30,954
Combine skill AND strategy.

65
00:04:31,054 --> 00:04:33,888
Right now you're lacking
a little something in both.

66
00:04:33,988 --> 00:04:35,588
Hrm...

67
00:04:35,688 --> 00:04:39,488
[RYU]
Although, that alone won't
be enough to defeat one.

68

You need to join up
with a Party.

69

If you seriously
hope to improve,

70
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:48,754
you'll have to find
one eventually anyway.

71
00:04:48,854 --> 00:04:51,854
[RYU]
Find someone whose strengths
compensate for your weaknesses,

72
00:04:51,954 --> 00:04:55,021
and you'll have no trouble
defeating the tougher enemies.

73
00:04:56,954 --> 00:04:59,888
[RYU]
Now, to answer your
question, Mr. Cranel,

74
00:04:59,988 --> 00:05:03,088
the main condition
for leveling up is simple ‐

75
00:05:03,188 --> 00:05:05,054
to go on adventures.

76
00:05:05,154 --> 00:05:08,188
[RYU]
And a journey is more
meaningful with multiple people.

77
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:12,188
I don't know what sort
of adventures you've had
to this point, but please,

78
00:05:12,288 --> 00:05:15,021
don't ever forget what
you've learned from them.

79
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:17,488
Uh. Huh?

80
00:05:17,588 --> 00:05:20,854
Cause in the end...
what I believe...

81
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,888
...is that if you
want something...

82
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:26,888
the only way to get it
is to step up and take it.

83
00:05:26,988 --> 00:05:31,388
[RYU]
But, that said, I have
been wrong in the past.

Just as before, we'll split into
two groups to avoid crowding.

Group one will go with me,

The Hephaistos Familia smiths
are joining us as well.

Please help him!

00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,354
I don't want

Hey, get off me,
you little squirt!

It must've taken
everything she had
just to bring us here!

[LILI]
Whatever it takes,
I'll pay you back!

I swear, okay?

335
00:16:27,888 --> 00:16:31,488
Just help him fight!
Please don't let him die.

00:16:37,421 --> 00:16:38,621
[LILI]
You have to help him...

339
00:16:38,721 --> 00:16:42,921
Help Master Bell...
I beg of you...

340
00:16:43,354 --> 00:16:44,554

[RIVERIA]
Uh! Where are
you going?

00:16:46,921 --> 00:16:48,421
Okay, now listen.

343
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:50,854
I don't normally help out
little punks like him.

344
00:16:50,954 --> 00:16:53,754
But I'd rather do that
than look like the guy
who enjoys picking on

345
00:16:53,854 --> 00:16:55,454
all the wimps and
the weaklings.

346

Outta the way.
I'll do it.

00:16:58,288 --> 00:16:59,288
Huh?

00:16:59,388 --> 00:17:00,354
(Minotaur roars)

00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:02,221
(Bell grunts)

00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,054
HYAAAH!

351
00:17:04,154 --> 00:17:07,221
Is that guy...
really a level 1?

352
00:17:07,321 --> 00:17:08,954
Only a month ago...

353
00:17:09,054 --> 00:17:11,421
you were very quick to
write him off as nothing more

354
00:17:11,521 --> 00:17:12,921
than a reckless amateur.

355
00:17:13,021 --> 00:17:15,254
[FINN]
Right, Bete?

356
00:17:15,354 --> 00:17:17,154
What the hell happened
to him since then?

00:17:23,588 --> 00:17:25,421
[BELL, THINKING]
This is MY adventure.

362
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:27,054
I WILL succeed!

363
00:17:27,154 --> 00:17:28,888
I will be a hero!

364
00:17:28,988 --> 00:17:31,688
YAAAHH!
[TIONE]
He's like the Argonaut.

365
00:17:31,788 --> 00:17:34,854
[FINN]
The legend about the boy
who wanted to be a hero.

366
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:37,354
[TIONA]
I always liked that story.

00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:51,521
Ah... Incredible...

Guh! Ngh!

377
00:17:58,254 --> 00:17:59,721
Now that is
one tough knife.

378
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:03,188
It's just a simple blade.
How is he doing that?

379
00:18:03,288 --> 00:18:04,421
Perhaps his technique...

380
00:18:04,521 --> 00:18:06,421
[TIONE]
He's really going all out.

381
00:18:06,521 --> 00:18:08,021
[TIONA]
But he's not
getting through.

382
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:11,388

A minotaur's skin
is extremely thick.

[TIONE]
He can do magic
without spells?!

389
00:18:25,221 --> 00:18:28,454
It would appear so, but this
foe is awfully strong.

390
00:18:28,554 --> 00:18:29,588
It's not THAT strong.

391
00:18:29,688 --> 00:18:31,288
[TIONE]
Is it a stalemate?

392
