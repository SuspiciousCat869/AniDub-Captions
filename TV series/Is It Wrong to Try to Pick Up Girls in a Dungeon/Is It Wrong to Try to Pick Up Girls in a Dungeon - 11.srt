I don't see them
over here.

41
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,833
If they were defeated
in this area,

42
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:45,466
then it's highly unlikely

43
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:48,400
that they'd get too far
if they lost their equipment.

[ASFI]
A party who'd do
something that foolish

00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,033
wouldn't have made it
to this point.

46
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:58,466
[ASFI]
So, the logical
conclusion must be...

47
00:03:58,566 --> 00:04:01,000
...that they gave up on
returning to the surface.

48
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,300
Instead, they decided they
would try to reach the safe
zone on Floor 18.

(Chigusa and Mikoto gasp)

The dungeon floors have
several vertical shafts.

51
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,666
They must've realized
going down would be
wiser than climbing up.

00:04:13,766 --> 00:04:16,900
[OUKA]
What? Did you just say
they went further DOWN?

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,500
Why would they do
something like that?

54
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,133
[RYU]
That's what I would do.
[GROUP] Hm?

to move forward.

00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,566
Oh, I can see where
you're coming from.

59
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:36,066
So do I. Bell went
in further inside.

00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:43,700
Huh?

00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,466
[BELL]
Welf... Lili...

00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:51,266
(Light snoring)
[AIS]
They're doing fine.

175
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:54,133
Riveria and the others
treated their wounds.
(Light snoring)

176
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:56,566
Your injuries were just
as bad as theirs.

177
00:09:56,666 --> 00:10:00,833
Ah! Uh, thanks for saving us.
I owe you one... again.

Mm‐mm.

00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:03,766
You think you
can stand up?

180
00:10:03,866 --> 00:10:05,000
Uh, yeah.

181
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,466
Then you might as well
come with me

182
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:08,933
so you can give a report
to the party leader.

183
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:10,766
Okay?

184
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,466
(Gareth laughs)

185
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:15,233
[GARETH]
So you got all the
way to Floor 18

186
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,166
on your first trip
to the middle floors...

187
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:19,833
and then you were able to run
right past the floor boss?

188
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:25,533
[BELL]
Not exactly, sir... I guess
you could say I got lucky.

189
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:29,533
Anyway, I want you to know
I'm really grateful to you

You have no idea.

You've been through
quite a lot.

You may feel free to
stay here as our guests.

193
00:10:34,866 --> 00:10:38,566
[BELL]
Thank you! I'll do whatever
I can to pay you back.

194
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,733
Well, I could never abandon
someone Ais cares about.

195
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,233
She would never
speak to me again!

[FINN]
Actually, there are several
members of our group

199
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:53,933
who've been badly poisoned
by the monsters.

200
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:57,733
We've sent some of
our best runners to
the surface to get a remedy.

201
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:03,433
So until they return, we've
decided to camp out on Floor 18.

00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:06,000
[TIONA]
Oh! It's
Mr. Argonaut!
AH!

It's good to see
you too, Ais.

[BELL] Ah. Uh.
[AIS] Tiona, Tione.

205
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,933
You finally woke up!

206
00:11:11,033 --> 00:11:12,566
So happy you're alright,
Mr. Argonaut!

207
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:16,333
Thanks, but... why do you
keep calling me that?

208
00:11:16,433 --> 00:11:19,000
(Girls both laugh)
[TIONE]
This goofball.

209
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,266
He doesn't even know
that's his nickname now.

210
00:11:21,366 --> 00:11:23,833
Mr. Argonaut,
you were really somethin'!

211
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,833
We all saw the way you kicked
that minotaur's butt back there!

212
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:29,966
It totally reminded me of one
of my favorite fairy tales

213
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:31,733
from back when
I was a little girl!

214
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,666
You're, like, my hero!

215
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:34,933
GAH!

(Giggles)

217
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,333
So I guess
you're level 2 ...

218
00:11:38,433 --> 00:11:41,266
Going down to the middle floors
is much more impressive

219
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:43,500
than defeating some
silly little minotaur.

220

(Boing)

221
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,566

I‐I... No... I, uh...

It was nothing really...
Aah...

00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,133
[COOK]
Oh don't worry,
I've cooked for groups

226
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:00,633
a lot larger
than this before.

00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:13,500
What's the matter?

230
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,533
So we, uh...

231
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,900
We ARE still in the
dungeon, aren't we?

232
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,700
How is it so bright
down here?

Is that a...?

Yes. It's completely
made of crystal.

238
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:42,000
[AIS]
The light fades in and
out periodically,

239
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,400
making it day and night.

Under Resort... that's
what some people call it.

00:12:52,766 --> 00:12:55,366
Or The Labyrinth

Well, she was right.

Where in the hell
are we?

I don't have
any idea.

anything?!

It's me.
It's me Bell!

There's nothing that could
ever make me forget who
YOU are, Master Bell.

253
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,666
I promise.

254
00:13:24,766 --> 00:13:28,666
Yeah, and I remember that
squeaky little rat voice...

255
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,400

I'm sorry I
wasn't stronger.

00:13:37,266 --> 00:13:39,700
Yeah and I must've
been a huge burden...

00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,866
My apologies.

No, you don't need
to apologize!

If it wasn't for Lili,

we wouldn't have even known
we needed to go to floor 18!

And if we didn't have you, those
Hell Hounds would've fried us!

264
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
This party wouldn't stand a
chance on the middle floors

without you two!
Don't you realize that?

(Chuckle)
True.

267
00:13:56,633 --> 00:14:00,333
So in other words, we
couldn't have really done
it without all of us!

[HESTIA]
How dare you interrupt our
beautiful, touching reunion?!

326
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,766
[LILI]
He got hurt really
badly when he saved us!

327
00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:36,333

HUH?! Wallen‐whatserface

329
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,266
[HESTIA]
Who invited her here?!
[LILI] That doesn't matter!

330
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:43,133
[RYU]
Mr. Cranel.
Huh?

331
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:44,600
[LILI]
Why are you here anyway?
Are you injured?

332
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,200
[HESTIA] What am I doing here?!
[BELL]
Miss Ryu?!

333
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,800
Shh.
[HESTIA] I came here
to rescue MY Bell...

334
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,600
(Arguing continues)
[HERMES]
Ah, the famous Bell Cranel.

335
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,233
[BELL]
Yeah.

336
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,266
(Arguing continues)
Ah, so it is you then!

337
00:16:53,366 --> 00:16:55,266
I couldn't wait to meet you!

338
00:16:55,366 --> 00:16:56,833
You can call me Hermes!

339
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,000
[HERMES]
Pleasure's all mine.

340
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,733
Thank you for coming, sir.

341
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,800
[HESTIA]
No problem. Anything
for my pal Hestia.

342
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,833
Besides, I think you should
direct your gratitude

343
00:17:06,933 --> 00:17:09,100
over in that direction.
Huh?

344
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,033
[HERMES]
They are the reason
we're here, after all.

345
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:17,166
(Grunt)

346
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,766
Hmph.

347
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,578
[MIKOTO]
We beg for your forgiveness!

348
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:30,545
[BELL]
Listen, you don't have
to do that...

349
00:17:30,645 --> 00:17:33,178
[LILI]
You can say sorry, but you can't
expect us to just forgive you.

350
00:17:33,278 --> 00:17:35,111
I mean, you guys almost
got all of us killed!

351
00:17:35,211 --> 00:17:37,645
[WELF]
She's right. I can't just
turn a blind eye

352
00:17:37,745 --> 00:17:39,111
to something like that.

353
00:17:39,211 --> 00:17:40,845
[CHIGUSA]
It was inexcusable...

354
00:17:40,945 --> 00:17:42,011
We're very sorry.

355
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:43,545
[MIKOTO]
We understand you
have every right

356
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,945
to be angry with us.

357
00:17:45,045 --> 00:17:47,345
[MIKOTO]
I take full responsibility‐

358
00:17:47,445 --> 00:17:49,611
If anyone here is
taking the blame...

359
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:52,011
I'd be the one
who deserves it.

360
00:17:52,111 --> 00:17:53,645
I chose this.

361
00:17:53,745 --> 00:17:55,711
And honestly, I still
don't believe it was
the wrong decision.

362
00:17:55,811 --> 00:17:59,845
Oh, you got a lot of nerve
sayin' somethin' like that
to my face, buddy.

363
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:00,878
Watch yourself.

00:18:08,345 --> 00:18:09,878
[BELL]
Wait...
[OTHERS] Huh?

367
00:18:09,978 --> 00:18:12,478
I mean...
if it were me...

368
00:18:12,578 --> 00:18:15,878
If Welf and Lili
were in danger...

369
00:18:15,978 --> 00:18:19,445
I think I might've
done the same thing.

370
00:18:19,545 --> 00:18:20,711
(Troubled sighs)

371
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:24,945
I guess if it'll
make you happy...

372
00:18:25,045 --> 00:18:26,645
Maybe I can let it go.

373
00:18:26,745 --> 00:18:28,678
But in no way does that mean
I accept it!

374
00:18:28,778 --> 00:18:31,545
Sure. That'll be
just fine with me.

375
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:32,678
(Bell and Hestia laugh)

376
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,911
Good.

377
00:18:34,011 --> 00:18:37,378
Alright then, why don't we
all discuss our next move?

378
00:18:37,478 --> 00:18:38,678
Asfi?

379
00:18:38,778 --> 00:18:41,111
We need to get back up
to the surface.

380
00:18:41,211 --> 00:18:45,578
Although, we should wait
until the Loki Familia
defeats Goliath.

381
00:18:45,678 --> 00:18:48,145
[ASFI]
It looks like they'll be
ready to move out again

382
00:18:48,245 --> 00:18:50,545
in about two days
at the earliest.

383
00:18:50,645 --> 00:18:53,711
So in other words,
we've got a full day to kill!

384
00:18:53,811 --> 00:18:55,545
[HERMES]
That's a rare opportunity,

385
00:18:55,645 --> 00:18:57,478
so let's get some
rest tomorrow.

386
00:18:57,578 --> 00:18:58,778
(All agreeing)

387
00:19:02,778 --> 00:19:04,645
[LILI]
Goodnight, Master Bell!

388
00:19:04,745 --> 00:19:07,078
[BELL]
Good night, Lili.

389
00:19:11,678 --> 00:19:12,911
[HESTIA]
Hey, Welf?

390
00:19:13,011 --> 00:19:14,145
[WELF]
Huh?

391
00:19:15,511 --> 00:19:19,111
Hephaistos said that she
wanted me to make sure I
got this to you.

392
00:19:19,211 --> 00:19:20,711
Uh...

393
00:19:22,378 --> 00:19:24,445
Along with a message.

00:19:26,478 --> 00:19:28,678
(Concerned sigh)

395
00:19:45,678 --> 00:19:48,878
[BELL]
I can't believe this is
really the dungeon.

396
00:19:50,211 --> 00:19:51,345
[AIS]
Everything okay?

397
00:19:51,445 --> 00:19:52,611
[BELL]
Oh?

398
00:19:52,711 --> 00:19:56,778
Oh, I just...
couldn't sleep.

399
00:19:58,145 --> 00:20:01,445

What are you doing
out here, Miss Ais?

400
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:04,478
[AIS]
I saw you
walking around.

401
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:09,411
Hm. I... I was worried
about you, Bell.

402

(Gasp)

403
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:12,645
Sorry if that
bugs you.

404
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,645
What?! No way!
Not at all!

405
00:20:14,745 --> 00:20:16,211
I'm glad you were‐
I mean‐ No!

WORRIED, I just... oh no...

seem to be so stressed.

When are you
heading out?

00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,378
[BELL]
Not until after
you guys leave.

413
00:20:31,478 --> 00:20:35,011
We're taking it easy tomorrow
since we're still pretty tired.

414
00:20:35,111 --> 00:20:38,111
Okay. So then you'll
get to see the city.

415
00:20:38,211 --> 00:20:41,011
What?! You mean there's a city
down here in the dungeon too?!

416
00:20:41,111 --> 00:20:43,978
Mm‐hmm. So you're
looking forward to it?

417
00:20:44,078 --> 00:20:45,211
Well, of course!

418
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:46,711
A city, huh?

419
00:20:46,811 --> 00:20:49,145
I wonder what kind
of place it is!

420

Hmm, I wonder...

Huh?

I think you've been holding
out on me, haven't you, Bell?

423
00:20:54,978 --> 00:20:56,245
GAH!

I cannot imagine why you
wouldn't invite ME first!

You can forget about
that city trip

431
00:21:13,178 --> 00:21:16,245
because I will never
ever EVER allow you to
go on a date with Bell!
