And inspiration.

00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,808
[BELL]
So when did you learn
to make potato croquettes?

160
00:06:51,908 --> 00:06:55,341
I started working part‐time
at a food‐cart, remember?

161
00:06:55,441 --> 00:06:58,041
One of the customers ordered
too much so he let me keep them!

162
00:06:58,141 --> 00:07:01,641
So why don't we turn dinner
into a wild party?

163
00:07:01,741 --> 00:07:03,141
Get ready...

164
00:07:03,241 --> 00:07:05,908
You're not gonna
get ANY sleep tonight!

165
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,975
Can we just go ahead
and eat?

166
00:07:08,075 --> 00:07:09,708
(laughs)

167
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:12,575
[HESTIA]
My poor little Familia.

168
00:07:12,675 --> 00:07:16,241
Seems like nobody's
interested in joining us.

169
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:19,841
[HESTIA]
Guess it's because I'm not
one of the "popular" gods.

170
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:23,641
Any of the gods out there can
give someone The Blessing.
(Crunch)

171
00:07:23,741 --> 00:07:26,141
I don't understand why no one
would want to choose you.

172
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:28,108
Well, I don't mind.

173
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:32,275
I think I'd like it to be
just you and me for now.

174
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:32,941
Huh?

175
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,975
Guh! Uh, never mind!

176
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:36,775
It must be really
hard for you

177
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,508
to bear such an incredible
burden all by yourself, Bell.

178

Don't worry about me.

180
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,475
[BELL]
I mean, look at this great
dinner you got us.

181
00:07:46,575 --> 00:07:49,308
C'mon it's just some
potato croquettes.

(Gulps)

183
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,508
I wish I could use Arcanum...

184
00:07:52,608 --> 00:07:54,508
but ever since we came
down to the lower world

185
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,775
there's been that stupid rule
that prevents the gods

186
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,008
from activating
their powers.

187
00:07:59,108 --> 00:08:00,908
I'm sorry, I guess you
really pledged yourself

188
00:08:01,008 --> 00:08:02,775
to a pretty lame goddess,
didn't you?

189
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,141
[BELL]
No! Don't say stuff
like that!
(Hestia squeals)

190
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:08,008
The Hestia Familia's just
getting started, okay?

191
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:09,375
Once we get through this,

192
00:08:09,475 --> 00:08:11,808
then things are gonna get
a lot easier.

193
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,475
Right?

Oh, Bell...!

00:08:15,008 --> 00:08:15,975
Hm.

00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:17,375
[HESTIA]
Thank you.

Well then, for the sake
of our future,

00:08:24,441 --> 00:08:26,341
why don't we give your
status a little touchup?

'Kay. Sounds like a plan!

[HESTIA, VOICE‐OVER]
Bell...
(Blood plops)

203
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,241
You dream about the
dungeon way too much.

204
00:08:34,341 --> 00:08:38,875
(Mystical whirring)
Do you really think you'll meet
someone in that nasty place?

205
00:08:38,975 --> 00:08:40,675
[BELL]
Uh... I dunno.

206
00:08:40,775 --> 00:08:43,308
[HESTIA]
And this "Ais
Wallen‐whatever" ...

207
00:08:43,408 --> 00:08:44,841
If she's really that great,

208
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,875
I'm sure tons of guys
are already after her.

209
00:08:46,975 --> 00:08:49,175
I mean there's probably a
couple drooling over her

210
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:50,808
right now as we speak!

211
00:08:50,908 --> 00:08:52,941

Are you upset
about something?

212
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,975

N‐no.

00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,975
Here's the thing, Bell.

218
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,275
Just try to be
more observant.

219
00:09:06,441 --> 00:09:09,308

The right girl is
closer than you think.

220
00:09:09,408 --> 00:09:11,275

Actually, your
true love's been

00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,808
right beside you
for a long time now!

222
00:09:13,908 --> 00:09:14,975
So...

the girl you've been
looking for...!

224

You've already met her!

Yeah, do you really
think so?

(Hustle chuckles)

227
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:26,075
Plus, Wallen‐whats'erface
is in the Loki Familia.

228
00:09:26,175 --> 00:09:28,041
So even if she DID
like you back,

229
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:30,341
it's not like you could
marry her anyway, right?

230
00:09:30,441 --> 00:09:31,408
Yeah...

231
00:09:31,508 --> 00:09:33,541
Then you might as well
forget all about her

232
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:35,875
and start looking for happiness
a little closer to home,

Wow, this looks pretty bad.

agility went up a bit.

236

Mhm. Oh yeah, that
happens sometimes

away in terror.

[BELL]
Magic's still zero, though.

slipped or something.

As usual it's
still empty.

way for me to get stronger.

The effect lasts as long as
he maintains his feelings,

00:10:32,141 --> 00:10:35,675
and increases depending
on how strong they are.

got yourself a Skill.

Huh?

316
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,041
It dropped an item.
Lucky me!

Goddess Hestia!
Are you sure this is right?

My experience level!
It's over 160 now!

328
00:13:47,108 --> 00:13:49,408
Look! I only took one hit
from those monsters

329
00:13:49,508 --> 00:13:51,608
and my endurance
jumped up to almost 30!

My Strength and Skill
went up, too!

[BELL]
I'm curious...

Do you know why...

00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,608
why my stats would have
started increasing so fast?

339

Uh, maybe?

[HESTIA]
I have to open up
the food cart!

I mean, since you can do
everything all by yourself now,

why don't you have dinner

Seriously, what's

How could that Skill

What does he want with that...
that girl...

Hey, Ais!

It's about time
you told everybody

C'mon, you know what

All those damn minotaurs
got loose!

430
00:17:59,631 --> 00:18:01,098
You told me you went
down

431
00:18:01,198 --> 00:18:02,964
and finished off the last of
'em on the 5th floor, right?

You had to save that

and this big, ugly sucker
starts chasing him, right?

435
00:18:12,131 --> 00:18:15,064
So Ais jumps in and cuts the
thing to pieces,

436
00:18:15,164 --> 00:18:18,098
and the little wuss gets
absolutely covered in blood!

[BETE]
And then check this out...

00:18:24,264 --> 00:18:27,031
THEN Tomato Guy runs out
screaming his freakin' head off!

441
00:18:27,131 --> 00:18:30,564
The dumbass just up and ran away
from the one who saved him!

What a pathetic

I'm not so sure he can be blamed
for any of that.
(Bell grimacing)

00:18:37,631 --> 00:18:39,431
That will be quite
enough out of you, Bete.

446
00:18:39,531 --> 00:18:43,498
The monsters only escaped
the 17th floor because of
our mistake.

447
00:18:43,598 --> 00:18:45,898
It wasn't the kid's fault.
Don't even try it.

448
00:18:45,998 --> 00:18:47,964
[BETE]
What?! The idiot bit off
more than he can chew

trying to be a hero.
(Bell fuming)

450
00:18:49,764 --> 00:18:52,264
You can ask Ais! She knows
what I'm talkin' about!

451
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:53,598
Tell 'er the truth!

Who's the more big, strong,
and handsome hero?

Me or that little,
scrawny tomato turd?!

00:18:57,664 --> 00:18:59,664
Uh Bete, I think you
might be drunk.

455
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,264
[BETE] I asked you
a question, Ais.
[FINN] Yep. Drunk.

456
00:19:02,364 --> 00:19:04,198
[BETE]
What would you do if that
kid walked up to you

457
00:19:04,298 --> 00:19:05,798
and said he had the
hots for ya?!

458
00:19:05,898 --> 00:19:07,864
I'm sure you would tell him
to get lost, right?!

459
00:19:07,964 --> 00:19:10,231
[BETE]
I mean, you wouldn't waste
your time on some crybaby

460
00:19:10,331 --> 00:19:11,664
you could totally crush.

461
00:19:11,764 --> 00:19:13,664
That sniveling, snotty
infant has no right

462
00:19:13,764 --> 00:19:14,998
to even be near you!

463
00:19:15,098 --> 00:19:17,664
You're way to good
for a loser like that!

464
00:19:17,764 --> 00:19:21,264
Can you imagine a
crotch‐sniffer like him
as your partner?!

465
00:19:21,364 --> 00:19:23,464
No! No! Not THE
Ais Wallenstein.

466
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:24,531
(Loud thud)
[ALL] Huh?

467
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:25,431
(Bell crying)
[AIS] Ah!

468
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:26,498
[SYR]
Bell, wait!

469
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:27,564
We got a
dine‐and‐dash.

470
00:19:27,664 --> 00:19:28,731
[LEFIYA]
Uh, Ais?

471
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:30,098
There's always
something scandalous

472
00:19:30,198 --> 00:19:32,998
going down at
Mama Mia's, am I right?

473
00:19:35,031 --> 00:19:36,231
[SYR]
Ah!

474
00:19:37,398 --> 00:19:38,631
[AIS]
Think that might've been...

475
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:40,264
[BETE]
HEY!
[AIS]
Ah?

476
00:19:40,364 --> 00:19:42,131
Hey! What are you guys
gonna do to me?!

477
00:19:42,231 --> 00:19:44,998
(All laughing)
[RIVERIA]
You're drunk, you need
to dry out and calm down.

478
00:19:45,098 --> 00:19:46,764
Ah...

479
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:57,598
[BELL, THINKING]
Dammit! Dammit! DAMMIT!

480
00:19:58,431 --> 00:19:59,631
[BELL]
Aargh!

481
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:00,664
(Monsters cries)

482
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:03,098
[BELL]
NGH! HAH!

483
00:20:03,831 --> 00:20:04,964
AH!

484
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,898
(Bell grunting and panting)

485
00:20:11,998 --> 00:20:14,231
[BELL, THINKING]
I was so stupid.

486
00:20:14,331 --> 00:20:17,831
How could I expect to get
something I don't deserve?

487
00:20:17,931 --> 00:20:21,364
I have to do this.
I have to.

488
00:20:21,464 --> 00:20:25,631
(Rocks crumbling)
I have to overcome everything
that confronts me...

489
00:20:25,731 --> 00:20:29,864
...or I will never be able
to stand next to her!

490
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:32,664
[BELL]
Ah?

491
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:34,164
[BELL]
War Shadows...

492
00:20:34,264 --> 00:20:36,698
(Shadows hiss and roar)

493
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:39,998
[BELL, THINKING]
I will... I will!

494
00:20:40,098 --> 00:20:41,098
Hyah!
(Battle grunts)

495
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,564
I will do it! I will do it!

496
00:20:43,664 --> 00:20:46,231
I will do whatever it takes
to be by her side!

497
00:20:46,331 --> 00:20:48,764
AHH!

498
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:56,164
(Birds chirping)

499
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:01,464
[HESTIA]
Bell, where did you
run off to?

500
00:21:01,564 --> 00:21:04,064
He didn't come back
home last night.

501
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:08,398
You wouldn't go...
and leave me, would you?

502
00:21:08,498 --> 00:21:09,864
Ah!

503
00:21:10,364 --> 00:21:11,331
[HESTIA]
Bell?!

504
00:21:11,431 --> 00:21:13,498
(Bell breathing heavily)

505
00:21:13,598 --> 00:21:14,964
[HESTIA]
Uh!

506
00:21:15,064 --> 00:21:17,064
(Hestia panting)

507
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:18,964
[HESTIA]
AH!

508
00:21:20,564 --> 00:21:22,631
You're bleeding!

509
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:25,164
Hey, Goddess...

510
00:21:25,764 --> 00:21:27,998
[BELL]
Ngh...

511
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:34,598
I want... to be strong.

512
00:21:34,698 --> 00:21:36,231
(Ending song begins)

513
00:21:36,331 --> 00:21:38,164
(Hestia laughs)

514
00:21:40,164 --> 00:21:41,698
[HESTIA]
Okay.

515
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,531
Here you go, Bell.

516
00:23:08,631 --> 00:23:10,864
You sleep on the bed
instead of the sofa tonight.

517
00:23:10,964 --> 00:23:14,098
I mean, well, since you're
injured and everything...

518
00:23:14,198 --> 00:23:15,698
I'm sorry...

519
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:19,398
My Goddess...
I'm just really exhausted...

520
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:20,931
(Giggles)

521
00:23:21,031 --> 00:23:24,431
You know, just to be safe,
I COULD always sleep WITH you...

522
00:23:24,531 --> 00:23:28,064
[BELL]
Yeah. Sure...
Let's get in bed...

523
00:23:28,164 --> 00:23:29,731
[HESTIA]
WHAT?!

524
00:23:29,831 --> 00:23:31,564
(Hestia struggling
and stammering)

525
00:23:31,664 --> 00:23:34,031
Wha‐?! Ah! Uh! G‐! Woah!

526
00:23:34,131 --> 00:23:35,898
Wait a minute, Bell,
I was just saying that

527
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,431
so you'd get all flustered like
you usually do, that's all!

528
00:23:38,531 --> 00:23:41,031
I'm not trying to SLEEP
with you, I just uh...

529
00:23:41,131 --> 00:23:44,598
(Bell snoring)
WAIT, YOU'RE ASLEEP ALREADY?!

530
00:23:45,531 --> 00:23:48,898
[HESTIA]
