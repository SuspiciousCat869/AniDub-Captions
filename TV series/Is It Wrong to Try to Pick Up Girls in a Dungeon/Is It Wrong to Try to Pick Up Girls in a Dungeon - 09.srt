Let me guess. Something really,
really good happened to you.

00:00:05,274 --> 00:00:07,040
Hm? Is it really
that obvious?

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,340
(Giggle) That goofy
little smile of yours
is a dead giveaway. Well?

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,574
(Laugh) Okay, now get this...
My most recent Status update
was the best one I've ever had.

00:00:15,674 --> 00:00:17,340

I just want to join
a Party, alright?!

I have a new skill and
everything!

There's gotta be
at least ONE

not full yet!

Yeah, I'm really
sorry, but uh...

[EINA]
WHAT?!
[BOTH] Huh?

11
00:00:24,707 --> 00:00:25,740
You mean you
hit level 2

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,740
in just a month
and a half?!

Uh...

I can't believe it.

I can't believe
I really beat a minotaur!

[HESTIA]
Okay, all done!

19
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,274
I guess that means I'm
officially up to level 2 now.

20
00:02:13,374 --> 00:02:15,574
But how come I don't
feel any different?

21
00:02:15,674 --> 00:02:16,574
Hmm...

22
00:02:16,674 --> 00:02:19,174
"Such incredible power!"

Is that actually what
you expected to happen?

Well, yeah,
I was hopin'.

00:02:24,407 --> 00:02:27,240
You'll get a feel
for it eventually.

[BELL]
What is it?

00:02:32,207 --> 00:02:33,707
[HESTIA]
A Skill.
Huh?

Your second, I mean,
your very first one! See?

After all this time your Skill

Wow... A Skill!
A real Skill!

Look at that Goddess Hestia,
my own Skill!

It's Argonaut...
or Heroic Aspiration.

Uh... wait, why do you have
to say it like that?

36
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,940
Because if you manifest this
particular kind of Skill...

37
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,074
It means that you still
have yet to grow out of
Uh...

your big dream of
being a fairy tale hero!

Well anyway, the important thing
is that now you have a Skill.

So all you need to figure out
is how it's supposed to work
and practice with it.

Fine...

Where are you
gonna go?

Well, today happens to be
Denatus Day,

so all the gods will be
having their quarterly

Well it's very important.

Oh, hey there, Take.

Impressive!

Took the Sword Princess
a year to get that far!

All the gods
are very excited.

Yeah, the name's Mikoto Yamato.

I'll have to use all
the leverage I can at
the council today.

some sweet new armor

to go along with
my second name.

I wonder what kind of badass
cool name I'll end up with.

Maybe Fire Blizzard?
Or Tornado Typhoon!

Did I hear that you and
Miss Arde are planning

125

I hope you won't think me
rude for saying this,

business down there.

That's not what
I'm saying at all.

But, they're nothing
like the upper floors.

monsters there...

you're not good enough,

00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:39,674
[MORD]
Partners are s'posed
to share their goods,

158
00:07:39,774 --> 00:07:41,274
y'know what I mean?
(Annoyed sigh)

159
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:42,774
Hey‐ Uh?
[RYU]
Get lost.

160
00:07:42,874 --> 00:07:45,740
You don't deserve someone
like him on your team.

161
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,340
Huh? Listen here,
sweetheart,

162
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,074
you know I can offer you a much
better time than this little
wimpy half‐pint ever could.

163
00:07:53,174 --> 00:07:54,107
What do you say?

164
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,274
[RYU]
You need to back off.

165
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:58,407
[MORD]
Ah! OH! (Pained yell)

166
00:07:58,507 --> 00:08:01,274
Understand it's not wise
to insult my friends.

167
00:08:01,374 --> 00:08:02,674
Ah!
(Shattering glass)

168
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,640
I don't care if you're
a chick or not,

169
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,207
I'm gonna kick your ass!

170
00:08:06,307 --> 00:08:07,107
[MIA]
Hey!

171
00:08:07,207 --> 00:08:10,107
(Steaming)

172
00:08:10,207 --> 00:08:13,407
[MORD] Huh?
[MIA]
This ain't that kind of
establishment, boys!

173
00:08:13,507 --> 00:08:15,174
If you wanna have
a tickle fight,

174
00:08:15,274 --> 00:08:16,974
you need to take it outside!

175
00:08:17,074 --> 00:08:18,040
(Both gasp)

176
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,540
O‐okay. We were
just leavin'‐

177
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,374
[MIA]
And don't forget about
your bill, you jackass!

178
00:08:22,474 --> 00:08:24,774
(Both panic)

179
00:08:35,207 --> 00:08:37,140
[BELL]
Nope...

180
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,207
Not this one, either.

181
00:08:39,307 --> 00:08:40,474
(Sigh)

182
00:08:40,574 --> 00:08:42,040
None of them are his.

183
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,707
What's the deal here? Hm?

184
00:08:43,807 --> 00:08:45,874
[WELF]
Hey man, why is my stuff
always in the back?

185
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:47,007
[SALESMAN]
Sir, please.

186
00:08:47,107 --> 00:08:48,674
[WELF]
I put my life on
the line to make it

187
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:50,674
and you can't even gimme
some decent shelf space?!

188
00:08:50,774 --> 00:08:53,140
Up nice'n high.
Eye‐level!
Ah, welcome, Sir.

189
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,607
Can I help you find something?

190
00:08:54,707 --> 00:08:56,707
Yeah, I can't find
any Welf Crozzo armor

191
00:08:56,807 --> 00:08:59,707
anywhere in the shop,
did you stop selling it?

192
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:01,074
Huh? Uh...

193
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:03,040
Huh? What?

194
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,340
(Snort)

195
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,174
(Loud laugh)
Wha‐?

196
00:09:07,274 --> 00:09:11,007
(Laughing continues)

197
00:09:11,107 --> 00:09:13,107
[WELF]
Shop 'til you drop, kid!

198
00:09:13,207 --> 00:09:15,807
Armor by Welf Crozzo.

199
00:09:15,907 --> 00:09:17,007
(Chuckle)

200
00:09:19,007 --> 00:09:21,440
[WELF] Well, well, well.
How 'bout that?

201
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,207
The Famous Little Rookie's
interested in my work!

202
00:09:24,307 --> 00:09:25,640
Oh, come on...

203
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,207
I never thought I would ever
meet THE Mr. Crozzo.

204
00:09:28,307 --> 00:09:29,507
(Annoyed grunt)

205
00:09:29,607 --> 00:09:31,374
Look, cut it out
with all the

206
00:09:31,474 --> 00:09:33,574
"Mr. Crozzo" stuff,
would ya?

207
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:35,407
That's way too formal
for my taste.

208
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:37,707
Mr... Welf, then?

209
00:09:37,807 --> 00:09:41,174
Still "Mr." huh?
Ah well, never mind.

210
00:09:41,274 --> 00:09:43,107
(Clears throat)

211
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,640
So, Bell Cranel!

212
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,874
[WELF]
You've purchased my armor
twice now, haven't you?

213
00:09:47,974 --> 00:09:51,540
I suppose that makes you
my very satisfied client.

214
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,707
Uh, what's going on.

215
00:09:56,507 --> 00:09:57,274
(Chuckles)

216
00:09:57,374 --> 00:09:58,340
Huh?

217
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,540
It's nothing.

218
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,540
It's just a little
territorial dispute.

219
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,874
Now then, Bell...

220
00:10:02,974 --> 00:10:05,540
How would you like to do
business directly?

221
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,440
What do you mean
by "directly"?

222
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,940
I will give you a special
deal on any weapons
and armor you need, but...

223
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,274
I do have one little
'ol request in exchange.

224
00:10:15,374 --> 00:10:16,374
It's not much.

225
00:10:16,474 --> 00:10:18,807
Hm? Okay.

226
00:10:18,907 --> 00:10:22,007
Bell, I humbly ask
to join your party.

227
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:25,540
Huh?

228
00:10:31,016 --> 00:10:33,569
[WELF]
Finally, I made it
to Floor 11! (Laughs)

229
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:37,303
Sorry, Bell, I guess
I shouldn't have asked you
to do this right away.

230
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,136
Nah, it's
no problem.

231
00:10:39,236 --> 00:10:41,603
You're doing it to build
up your smithing ability,

232
00:10:41,703 --> 00:10:43,036
so in the long run
this'll benefit me too

233
00:10:43,136 --> 00:10:45,003
as someone who has
a contract with you.

234
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,969
Well, I'm glad at least ONE of
us is excited about all this...

235
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:50,103
[BELL]
Hm?
[LILI]
Don't you think

236
00:10:50,203 --> 00:10:53,536
you should be adventuring with
somebody from your OWN Familia?

237
00:10:53,636 --> 00:10:55,336
(Grunt)

238
00:10:55,436 --> 00:10:57,469
Uh, actually, Lili...

239
00:10:57,569 --> 00:10:59,736
Mr. Welf and his Familia
don't, uh...

240
00:10:59,836 --> 00:11:02,036
Hmph. He doesn't get
along with them?

241
00:11:02,136 --> 00:11:04,236
Hmm.
So you fell for this
guy's sob story

242
00:11:04,336 --> 00:11:07,303
just because he bribed
you with some stupid armor?!
Uh!

243
00:11:07,403 --> 00:11:10,103
Huh?
[LILI]
Why didn't you discuss
this with me first?!

244
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,803
(Welf clears throat)
[BELL]
I'm sorry.

245
00:11:11,903 --> 00:11:13,503
Am I THAT much of a burden?

246
00:11:13,603 --> 00:11:14,703
Huh, Pipsqueak?

247
00:11:14,803 --> 00:11:16,303
Hey, don't call
me Pipsqueak!

248
00:11:16,403 --> 00:11:19,269
I have a name and it
happens to be Liliruca Arde!

249
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:21,336
Oh! Pardon me, Little Bit!

250
00:11:21,436 --> 00:11:22,803
Put 'er there!
Uh!

251
00:11:22,903 --> 00:11:24,336
I don't think so.

252
00:11:24,436 --> 00:11:25,636
Lili, please...

253
00:11:25,736 --> 00:11:27,303
I'd appreciate it
if we could all get along.

254
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:30,403
I mean Welf Crozzo makes
really good armor, so...

255
00:11:30,503 --> 00:11:31,903
Crozzo?!

256
00:11:32,003 --> 00:11:33,969
[LILI]
Did you say "Crozzo"?
(Welf groans)

257
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:35,103
H‐hm...

258
00:11:35,203 --> 00:11:36,769
[LILI]
The cursed magic
swordsmiths from the

259
00:11:36,869 --> 00:11:39,203
failed smithing nobility?!
Hm?

260
00:11:39,303 --> 00:11:40,403
Wait, what?

261
00:11:40,503 --> 00:11:42,536
You really didn't
know about that?!

262
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:47,469
[LILI]
The Crozzos used to be famous
for being able to make
powerful magic swords.

263
00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:53,103
But then, one day, they lost
all of their abilities, and now
the family's ruined forever!

264
00:11:53,203 --> 00:11:55,169
Really? None of that
rings a bell?

265
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:57,703
[WELF]
Yep, the Crozzo name
is worthless.
[BELL] Huh?

266
00:11:57,803 --> 00:12:00,003
Who cares about what
we USED to be good at?

267
00:12:00,103 --> 00:12:01,503
Yeah, but‐
(Crumbling rock)

268
00:12:01,603 --> 00:12:03,003
[ALL]
Huh?

269
00:12:03,103 --> 00:12:04,436
(Ground crumbles)

270
00:12:04,536 --> 00:12:07,636
I don't think right now is the
best time to talk about it.

271
00:12:07,736 --> 00:12:09,536
(Growling)

272
00:12:09,636 --> 00:12:12,803
[WELF]
Okay, you can leave
the orcs to me.

273
00:12:12,903 --> 00:12:15,203
They shouldn't be too hard
for me to handle by myself.

274
00:12:15,303 --> 00:12:19,003
[LILI]
Right. Then I guess I'll try to
back you up the best I can.

275
00:12:19,103 --> 00:12:22,336
[WELF]
Aw, thanks, Little Bit!
I think she likes me.

276
00:12:22,436 --> 00:12:25,069
No, you totally make
me wanna puke.
[WELF]
PFFT! HA!

277
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:27,769
[LILI]
But I can't let you get
in Master Bell's way.

278
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:28,969
Hm.
(Growling continues)

279
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:30,536
[BELL]
Alright, let's do this.

280
00:12:30,636 --> 00:12:32,536
These guys are mine!

281
00:12:32,636 --> 00:12:35,003
(Screeching)

282
00:12:35,103 --> 00:12:37,003
[BELL, THINKING]
Was he slow... or...

283
00:12:37,103 --> 00:12:37,636
Huh?

284
00:12:37,736 --> 00:12:38,803
Hyah! Gah!

285
00:12:38,903 --> 00:12:40,936
...have I gotten faster?

286
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:44,103
HYAAH!

287
00:12:44,203 --> 00:12:45,636
AGH!

288
00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:47,236
(Distant clashing)

289
00:12:47,336 --> 00:12:48,869
Huh? Holy...!

290
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:52,203
(Panting)

291
00:12:52,303 --> 00:12:53,303
Mr. Welf! Lili! Look out!

292
00:12:53,403 --> 00:12:55,936
(Roaring)
(Both scream)

293
00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:58,303
Fire Bolt!

294
00:13:01,636 --> 00:13:03,836
(Boom and fizzle)

295
00:13:03,936 --> 00:13:07,169
[BELL, THINKING]
My magic is stronger, too!

296
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:08,536
It's working...

297
00:13:08,636 --> 00:13:11,403
I'm finally starting
to get closer...

298
00:13:11,503 --> 00:13:14,436
...to Ais Wallenstein!

299
00:13:14,536 --> 00:13:15,503
(Bete yelling)

300
00:13:15,603 --> 00:13:16,869
[TIONA]
Move it, Bete!

301
00:13:16,969 --> 00:13:18,969
I don't wanna
cut you up!

302
00:13:19,069 --> 00:13:22,736
[BETE]
Like that weak‐ass weapon could
even put a scratch on me! AH!

303
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:25,069
[GARETH]
What's got those two
all outta whack?

304
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:28,503
They can't teach the
others acting like that.

305
00:13:28,603 --> 00:13:32,436
[RIVERIA]
It seems they were inspired by
an adventurer they met earlier.

306
00:13:32,536 --> 00:13:35,836
Hmm. I take it you're talking
about that skinny young fella

307
00:13:35,936 --> 00:13:38,269
you ran into before
we all met up here.

308
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:41,369
Indeed. His name
is Bell Cranel.

309
00:13:41,469 --> 00:13:42,503
[AIS]
I'm going, too.

310
00:13:42,603 --> 00:13:44,236
[GARETH]
Uh, and what's with her?

311
00:13:44,336 --> 00:13:47,636
[RIVERIA]
Hm. Would appear he must have
lit a fire in her as well.

312
00:13:47,736 --> 00:13:49,369
(Slicing)

313
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:58,703
[WELF]
Whoo! Sure is good to be
in a party, am I right?

314
00:13:58,803 --> 00:14:00,703
[BELL]
Totally, there's not
nearly as much stuff

315
00:14:00,803 --> 00:14:02,303
to worry about this way.

316
00:14:02,403 --> 00:14:04,236
That's the idea, y'know?

317
00:14:04,336 --> 00:14:06,369
Whenever you have more fighters,
it changes the way

318
00:14:06,469 --> 00:14:07,936
you're gonna behave
in combat.

319
00:14:08,036 --> 00:14:10,869
[BELL]
Huh? Another party
just showed up.

320
00:14:10,969 --> 00:14:12,836
Let's eat lunch after
Little Bit finishes

321
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:15,536
picking up all
the magic stones.
Hm.

322
00:14:15,636 --> 00:14:17,403
We'll leave the
monsters to them.

323
00:14:17,503 --> 00:14:19,503
Hey, sparkles.
What's that?

324
00:14:19,603 --> 00:14:21,036
Huh?

325
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,436
(Twinkling)

326
00:14:23,536 --> 00:14:25,703
I don't know...

327
00:14:25,803 --> 00:14:27,036
(Screaming)
[BOTH]
Huh?

328
00:14:27,136 --> 00:14:30,603
(Panting)
(Heavy footsteps and roaring)

329
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,803
[BOTH]
HUH?!

330
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:32,836
[MAN 1]
Get outta here!

331
00:14:32,936 --> 00:14:34,003
It's a Dragon!
HUH?!

332
00:14:34,103 --> 00:14:34,769
[MAN 2]
RUN!

333
00:14:34,869 --> 00:14:36,269
Wait, where's Lili?!

334
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:38,003
(Roaring)

335
00:14:38,103 --> 00:14:38,669
(Man screams)

336
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:39,869
AH!
(Lili gasps)

337
00:14:39,969 --> 00:14:41,836
[BELL]
Lili!
Get outta there, now!

338
00:14:41,936 --> 00:14:42,369
Ah!

339
00:14:42,469 --> 00:14:43,636
(Roaring)

340
00:14:43,736 --> 00:14:46,669
(Panting)

341
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:49,036
HAH!
Fire Bolt!

342
00:14:49,136 --> 00:14:51,603
AH! Ugh!

343
00:14:52,136 --> 00:14:53,236
(Boom and fizzle)

344
00:14:53,336 --> 00:14:55,136
(Gasp)

345
00:14:55,236 --> 00:14:56,503
(Both speechless)

346
00:14:56,603 --> 00:14:58,003
(Heavy thud)
AH!

347
00:14:59,136 --> 00:15:00,569
Huh?

348
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:02,469
[HESTIA]
Uh‐huh, no doubt about it.

349
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:05,236
That right there was
your Argonaut Skill.

350
00:15:05,336 --> 00:15:07,469
It gives you an opportunity
to turn the tables.

351
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:10,869
Since you always wanted to
become a hero so badly...

352
00:15:10,969 --> 00:15:13,969
I guess you can consider it to
be kind of a shortcut, you know?

353
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:17,103
Whenever you find
yourself with the odds
all stacked against you...

354
00:15:17,203 --> 00:15:20,503
you can still be able to win
with the small bit of power
you have left.

355
00:15:20,603 --> 00:15:22,869
That's what we like
to call a Hero Shot.

356
00:15:22,969 --> 00:15:24,769
And it fits you
just perfectly.

357
00:15:24,869 --> 00:15:26,036
I mean, don't you think?

358
00:15:26,136 --> 00:15:27,836
Huh...

359
00:15:28,836 --> 00:15:30,469
[BELL]
I wanted to ask you...

360
00:15:30,569 --> 00:15:34,169
Have you ever heard of
a disgraced family of
nobles called Crozzo?

361
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:36,603
That's your friend's
family, isn't it?

362
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:40,436
They used to be super famous
because they could create
magical swords,

363
00:15:40,536 --> 00:15:42,169
but that's all I
really know about them.

364
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:43,603
Uh‐huh...

365
00:15:43,703 --> 00:15:45,903
But if you're asking about
Welf Crozzo in particular,

366
00:15:46,003 --> 00:15:48,669
they did tell me a little
something about him at the shop.

367
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:50,703
He has the ability to make
magic swords, too.

368
00:15:50,803 --> 00:15:52,469
(Choking)
Huh?!

369
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:55,636
And from what I've heard they
are like ridiculously powerful.

370
00:15:55,736 --> 00:16:00,269
Apparently the rest of
his Familia refers to him
as the "Unused Treasure."

371
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:01,803
Why is that?

372
00:16:01,903 --> 00:16:04,069
Because the dummy never
actually makes them.

373
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:06,803
I'm sure he could easily
have all the fame and riches
he could ever want

374
00:16:06,903 --> 00:16:10,203
if he just made a few,
but for some reason, he refuses.

375
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,569
(Sigh)
Unfortunately,

376
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:13,436
you've made yourself a
contract with someone

377
00:16:13,536 --> 00:16:14,836
who's got insane talent

378
00:16:14,936 --> 00:16:17,303
but has no desire to actually
put it to good use.

379
00:16:17,403 --> 00:16:18,603
Hm...

380
00:16:19,469 --> 00:16:20,969
(Laughs)

381
00:16:25,877 --> 00:16:27,822
[WELF]
So, Little Bit's
taking some time off?

382
00:16:27,922 --> 00:16:30,822
[BELL]
Yeah. The father of that gnome
that runs the boarding house

383
00:16:30,922 --> 00:16:33,155
told me she's sick
and needs to rest.

384
00:16:33,255 --> 00:16:35,789
She said she's sorry
she can't make it.

385
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:38,089
Ah, that's too bad.

386
00:16:38,189 --> 00:16:39,589
In that case,

387
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:41,722
do you maybe want to come
hang out with me for the day?

388
00:16:41,822 --> 00:16:42,722
Huh?

389
00:16:42,822 --> 00:16:44,055
Just think of it this way:

390
00:16:44,155 --> 00:16:47,189
I'd like to say thank you
for letting me be in your party.

391
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:49,689
[WELF]
I want to make you
a new piece of gear!

392
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:50,722
(Happy gasp)

393
00:16:59,355 --> 00:17:02,522
(Door creaks)

394
00:17:04,122 --> 00:17:07,755
[BELL]
Is this... where you make
your weapons, Mr. Welf?

395
00:17:07,855 --> 00:17:11,389
Yeah, sorry about the mess.
Didn't expect a guest.

396
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,255
Oh, no! That's okay!

397
00:17:13,355 --> 00:17:15,055
[WELF]
So what do you need?

398
00:17:15,155 --> 00:17:16,822
Feel free to try
something out.

399
00:17:16,922 --> 00:17:18,189
I don't need anything.

400
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:20,289
The light armor you gave
me is perfectly fine.

401
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:23,655
You should always be looking
for better armor, Bell.

402
00:17:23,755 --> 00:17:26,355
Adventurers need to make sure
they're as prepared as possible

403
00:17:26,455 --> 00:17:28,755
at any given time. Right?

404
00:17:28,855 --> 00:17:30,755
Uh, well, that's true.

405
00:17:30,855 --> 00:17:32,455
Huh?

406
00:17:32,922 --> 00:17:34,222
(Amazed gasp)

407
00:17:34,322 --> 00:17:36,789
Hey, you mind if I
take a look at this?

408
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:37,589
[WELF]
Try it.

409
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:39,255
(Sheen)

410
00:17:39,355 --> 00:17:41,155
[WELF]
That one didn't sell.

411
00:17:41,255 --> 00:17:43,922
Seriously?
It's awesome.

412
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:44,889
(Chuckle)

413
00:17:44,989 --> 00:17:46,355
Wait, what's so funny?

414
00:17:46,455 --> 00:17:49,089
Thought you'd be looking for
MAGIC swords, that's all.

415
00:17:49,189 --> 00:17:50,655
Huh?

416
00:17:50,755 --> 00:17:53,289
[WELF]
I assume Goddess Hestia's
already told you about my

417
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:55,222
special talent
for making them.

418
00:17:55,322 --> 00:17:57,089
Wah! Ah!
(Sigh)

419
00:17:57,189 --> 00:17:58,889
Apparently, she's been
asking around about me

420
00:17:58,989 --> 00:18:00,089
for the past few days.

421
00:18:00,189 --> 00:18:01,922
Ah! Sorry...

422
00:18:02,022 --> 00:18:03,489
It's really not a big deal.

423
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:06,055
I mean, I contracted with
a member of her Familia...

424
00:18:06,155 --> 00:18:07,655
I get it.

425
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:10,789
But... I thought that you
might think badly of me

426
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:11,855
if I told you...

427
00:18:11,955 --> 00:18:13,155
so I didn't.

428
00:18:13,255 --> 00:18:14,522
Huh...

429
00:18:14,622 --> 00:18:17,055
I am sorry I deceived
you like that.

430
00:18:17,155 --> 00:18:18,455
I‐it's okay.

431
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,955
Now, let's get back to
what I should make for you.

432
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,722
Did you get that
from a monster?

433
00:18:22,822 --> 00:18:23,955
Huh?

434
00:18:24,055 --> 00:18:26,122
Uh, yeah, it's
a minotaur horn.

435
00:18:26,222 --> 00:18:28,489
I couldn't let myself
throw it away.

436
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:30,089
[WELF]
Well, why don't
we use that?

437
00:18:30,189 --> 00:18:31,355
For what?

438
00:18:31,455 --> 00:18:33,222
[WELF]
To make you some
equipment out of,

439
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:34,355
what else?

440
00:18:34,455 --> 00:18:37,155
(Gasp) You mean you
can do that?

441
00:18:37,255 --> 00:18:38,289
[WELF]
Can I do that?

442
00:18:38,389 --> 00:18:40,222
Well then, of course!

443
00:18:40,322 --> 00:18:41,289
(Chuckle)

444
00:18:41,389 --> 00:18:44,722
(Coals fizzling and popping)

445
00:18:48,755 --> 00:18:50,522
(Loud sizzling)

446
00:18:50,622 --> 00:18:53,289
[WELF]
I despise magic swords.

447
00:18:53,389 --> 00:18:54,689
[BELL]
What?

448
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:57,855
[WELF]
They always bring out
the worst clients.

449
00:18:57,955 --> 00:19:03,589
Everybody comes to me because
they want a magic sword
and they know I'm a Crozzo.

450
00:19:04,389 --> 00:19:05,889
[WELF]
I'm so tired of it.

451
00:19:05,989 --> 00:19:08,455
All they ever talk about
is how they want something

452
00:19:08,555 --> 00:19:12,322
that'll "make them strong"
or "make them famous."

453
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:16,822
But that's so wrong.

454
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,255
They're missing the point.

455
00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:22,322
That's not what
weapons are for.

456
00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:29,155
[WELF]
A weapon's not a means
to conquer the world.

457
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:31,289
It's an equal partner
with its user.

458
00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:33,289
[WELF]
No matter what happens,

459
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:36,455
your weapon is the one thing
that should never betray you.

460
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:39,555
But magic swords
aren't like that.

461
00:19:39,655 --> 00:19:42,655
They always break
and leave you with nothing.

462
00:19:42,755 --> 00:19:44,755
They destroy people.

463
00:19:44,855 --> 00:19:49,322
The user's pride, the smith's
reputation... everything.

464
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:53,989
That's why I have always
refused to forge one.

465
00:19:54,089 --> 00:19:56,355
(Sizzling)

466
00:19:58,089 --> 00:19:59,489
Uh!

467
00:20:01,989 --> 00:20:02,889
Hm.

468
00:20:02,989 --> 00:20:04,489
(Amazed gasp)

469
00:20:04,589 --> 00:20:06,522
[WELF]
The material was
really nice.

470
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:10,889
Of all the things I've made,
this might be the best one.

471
00:20:10,989 --> 00:20:15,389
So then,
I think we should
call it... Ushiwakamaru.

472
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:19,122
It's an ancient warrior's
name that was derived
from the word for "bull".

473
00:20:19,222 --> 00:20:20,855
Hey, now! I don't think
we really need to put

474
00:20:20,955 --> 00:20:22,255
all THAT much
thought into it!

475
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:25,222
Huh? So you don't
like Ushiwakamaru?

476
00:20:25,322 --> 00:20:26,855
The name is not
what matters here!

477
00:20:26,955 --> 00:20:30,655
Yeah, well...
We gotta call it somethin'.

478
00:20:30,755 --> 00:20:31,955
Here.
Huh?

479
00:20:32,055 --> 00:20:35,255
I really appreciate this,
Mr. Welf.

480
00:20:35,689 --> 00:20:37,155
Huh? Hm?

481
00:20:37,255 --> 00:20:39,422
I know we just met
and all...

482
00:20:39,522 --> 00:20:42,022
and you don't have any
reason to trust me.

483
00:20:42,122 --> 00:20:43,755
But, Bell...

484
00:20:43,855 --> 00:20:45,322
I'm your friend now...

485
00:20:45,422 --> 00:20:47,922
How about you stop
calling me "Mister"?

486
00:20:50,122 --> 00:20:51,455
Hah...

487
00:20:51,555 --> 00:20:53,189
(Laughs)

488
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:56,789
Okay. It's a deal.

489
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,789
(Ending Song)

490
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:30,389
It's time to begin
the final meeting!

491
00:22:30,489 --> 00:22:33,622
[LILI]
That way leads to Floor 13
and the middle floors.

492
00:22:33,722 --> 00:22:37,455
The monsters down there can use
fire and other ranged attacks.

493
00:22:37,555 --> 00:22:40,589
Don't let your guard down
even for a minute!

494
00:22:40,689 --> 00:22:41,689
You understand?

495
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:43,022
Gotcha.
Hm.

496
00:22:43,122 --> 00:22:44,289
From here on out

497
00:22:44,389 --> 00:22:46,255
we'll be moving in a
specific formation.

498
00:22:46,355 --> 00:22:48,122
Master Welf
in front.

499
00:22:48,222 --> 00:22:50,089
(Welf laughs)
[LILI]
Master Bell's
the middle guard

500
00:22:50,189 --> 00:22:52,722
Hm.
since that's the
most crucial spot.

501
00:22:52,822 --> 00:22:55,689
And I will be at
the back of the line.

502
00:22:55,789 --> 00:22:57,722
However, putting a supporter
in the rear position

503
00:22:57,822 --> 00:22:59,989
won't give us much firepower
to work with,

504
00:23:00,089 --> 00:23:01,422
so don't forget to‐
(Bell laughs)

505
00:23:01,522 --> 00:23:03,289
What do you think
you're laughing at?

506
00:23:03,389 --> 00:23:04,689
Cut it out, Sir!

507
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:07,155
I really need for you to
take this seriously, okay?

508
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:09,822
I'm sorry. I'll stop.

509
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:11,422
But isn't this somethin'?!

510
00:23:11,522 --> 00:23:14,922
[BELL]
The three of us, going on
an adventure together!

511
00:23:15,022 --> 00:23:16,022
(Chuckle)

512
00:23:16,122 --> 00:23:18,422
(Hearty laugh)

513
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,022
(Bell laughs)
That's right, dude!

514
00:23:20,122 --> 00:23:22,622
Glad to see you're looking
forward to it as much as me!

515
00:23:22,722 --> 00:23:25,455
[LILI]
You guys should not be
goofing off right now!

516
00:23:25,555 --> 00:23:26,422
Huh?

517
00:23:26,522 --> 00:23:28,289
But, yeah, I know
how you feel.

518
00:23:28,389 --> 00:23:29,989
(Both laugh)

519
00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:32,189
[BELL, THINKING]
This... feels good.

520
00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:35,089
We may be from
different Familias,

521
00:23:35,189 --> 00:23:36,655
but we are a team.

522
00:23:36,755 --> 00:23:39,289
[LILI]
Alright, guys,
are we ready to do this?

523
00:23:39,389 --> 00:23:41,089
[WELF]
Yeah, let's do it!

524
00:23:41,189 --> 00:23:42,789
[BELL]
Right!

525
00:23:44,655 --> 00:23:48,689
[HESTIA]
Next time:
"Pass Parade"
