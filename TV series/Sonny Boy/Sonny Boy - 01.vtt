This was on you. See?

[NAGARA]
Mm. Thank you.

00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:38.163
So, like, is that
fun or something?

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:39.164
[NAGARA]
Huh?

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:42.125
You'll spend the entire day just
lying on the floor like that.

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:43.126
Is it fun?

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:46.672
Oh, uh... Well...
'Course it is.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:49.508
Oh, yeah? You don't say.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.478
[NOZOMI]
Ugh, they're at it again...

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.439
Playing super‐powers,
taking it too far.

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:05.774
Not surprising.

00:01:05.816 --> 00:01:07.401
[NOZOMI]
You have one, Nagara?

00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:08.569
What?

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.904
[NOZOMI]
Do you have a super‐power?

00:01:10.946 --> 00:01:13.365
Wouldn't be on
the floor if I did.

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:15.659
[NOZOMI]
Fair point. Should've guessed.

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:19.371
‐‐[CAT 01A purring]
‐‐[NOZOMI] Anyway.

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:22.666
I wonder why all of this
craziness is happening.

00:01:22.708 --> 00:01:25.210
Like, the rest of the world
vanished and the only thing left

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:26.920
is the school.

00:01:26.962 --> 00:01:29.256
How are we gonna
fix this mess, huh?

00:01:29.298 --> 00:01:32.509
Our summer vacation plans
are all screwed up.

[NOZOMI] Hey. So what
do you think this place is?

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:40.934
A utopia?

00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:42.519
Or Hell?

00:01:44.813 --> 00:01:46.273
I don't know.

00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:50.360
Oh! Going somewhere?

00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:51.903
To the bathroom.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.989

00:02:03.165 --> 00:02:04.791
Jeez, you guys!

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:07.377
Are you trying to break
all of the windows in here?

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:09.129
[HOSHI]
Well. What do you expect?

00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:12.674
Ugh. No one's using their brain
and it's pissing me off!

00:02:12.716 --> 00:02:14.676
I mean, I totally get it.

00:02:14.718 --> 00:02:16.261
Yeah? You get what?

00:02:16.303 --> 00:02:18.764
Most of those guys were just
regular losers yesterday,

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:21.308
and then‐‐boom‐‐they
get these crazy powers.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.143
It seems only natural
that they'd wanna see

00:02:23.185 --> 00:02:25.145
what they can do,
don't ya think?

00:02:25.187 --> 00:02:27.814
[CAP] Well, sure, but when
things go back to normal,

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:29.650
all this crap is gonna be on us.

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:31.234
How so?

00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:32.778
[CAP] The teacher's'll
say something like,

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.947
we neglected our duties
as the student council.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.701
I don't want that on my
permanent record, do you?

00:02:39.743 --> 00:02:42.788
[HOSHI] Relax, man.
I'll think of something.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.207
They won't be
breaking anything else.

00:02:45.248 --> 00:02:47.125
[CAP]
How're you gonna stop 'em?

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.002
Like, you've seen
their powers, right?

00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:50.629
You're convincing, but...

00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:52.756
[HOSHI] Have you ever known me
to say I'm gonna do something,

00:02:52.798 --> 00:02:54.633
and then not deliver?

00:02:54.675 --> 00:02:56.593
[CAP]
No, you're right.

00:02:56.635 --> 00:02:58.720
But, we're part of
the group who didn't get

00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:00.972
any cool powers, remember?

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:03.725
[HOSHI] It'll be fine.
I'll think of something.

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:05.936
Sheep aren't
that smart, after all.

00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:08.397
I just have to
show them the way.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.653
[CAP] Okay, but how
are you gonna do that?

00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:19.574
It'll be easy. We just need
to make some new rules.

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:21.827
Ones specifically
for "This World."

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:25.163
[CAP] Rules, huh?
And nobody's gonna break 'em?

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:26.957
It's like soccer, ya know?

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:30.335
What happens when
somebody commits a foul?

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:32.045
They get a penalty.

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:33.630
Yup.

00:03:37.134 --> 00:03:38.051
[sighs]

00:03:41.722 --> 00:03:44.266
[NOZOMI]
Ugh. It's so boring here.

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:46.435
And you're the only person
I have to talk to.

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:48.520
Well, you could try
and make some new friends.

00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:51.356
Ugh. Yeah, I guess.

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:54.359
I mean, maybe if I got some
kind of cool super‐power,

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:55.944
things'd be better.

00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:58.530
You think so? Not sure I care.

00:03:58.572 --> 00:04:01.616
Oh, yeah? That's big talk.

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:03.285
[NAGARA]
Not really my point.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.622
[NOZOMI] Well. Here's my theory
on the whole thing.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:08.623
Huh?

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:10.333
I'm thinking it wasn't
everything around us

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:13.712
that disappeared,
we were the ones who vanished.

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:18.341
And this all feels way too real
to be some weird dream.

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:20.343
[NAGARA] Still doesn't
really help us, though.

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:21.678
[NOZOMI]
Hmm?

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.513
Won't change what happened.

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:27.309
[NOZOMI grunts]
Hey, what do you think that is?

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.769
What is?

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.648
[NOZOMI] That thing.
Whatever's shining up there.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.442
Okay?

00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:36.818
I don't see anything.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.738
[NOZOMI]
Huh? Are you serious?

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.490
Should I be seeing it?

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:42.991
No.

[ASAKAZE gasps]

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:25.951
[HOSHI] We're unable to
contact anyone on the outside.

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:27.202
I'm sure our parents
and teachers

00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:29.454
must be extremely worried.

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:31.414
This is a major incident,
and it's very likely

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:33.416
the country's top news story.

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:35.627
"...a major incident, and
it's very likely the country's

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.587
top news story."

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.090
As far as we know,
the school is completely alone

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:42.259
in this mysterious darkness.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.763
And, from what I can tell,
we are basically adrift.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:48.890
There seem to be
strange forces at work.

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:51.601
Super powers and
other unnatural phenomena.

00:05:51.643 --> 00:05:54.604
Now, we're seeing how these
powers are having an effect.

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:56.731
On the condition of
the building itself.

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:57.732
[ASAKAZE]
Hmph.

00:05:57.774 --> 00:06:00.277
Because those who've
gained these abilities,

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:03.071
are frankly being very
reckless with their use.

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:04.573
[MIZUHO]
Ugh...

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:06.658
[HOSHI] At some point,
we anticipate that someone

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.201
will be coming to our rescue.

00:06:08.243 --> 00:06:10.078
However, as students
of this school,

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.873
we can't forget we still
have responsibilities.

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:14.875
We cannot lose sight of
the fact that we are all

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:16.459
in our senior year.

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:20.005
So, with that said,
I have a proposal for you.

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:22.215
In order to fulfill
our obligations,

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:24.676
we'll each have
duties chosen for us.

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:28.555
And to make those decisions,
we'll need a leader.

00:06:28.597 --> 00:06:31.933
We will choose one from
the 36 of us here.

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:35.437
And we will craft the rules
for this world together!

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:40.692
[HOSHI] Congrats, big guy!
Because you're our new leader!

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:42.402
Are you really sure
about all this?

00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:43.904
It should be you, Machi.

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:45.822
I mean, you're the
Student Council Prez.

00:06:47.157 --> 00:06:49.367
[HOSHI]
No.

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:51.870
The student body chose you, Cap.

00:06:54.706 --> 00:06:56.041
Right!

00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:00.462
[NOZOMI] Think back,
before the summer break,

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:02.255
do you remember anything
out of the ordinary

00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:03.798
happening at school?

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.759
Oh. What?

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.177
[NOZOMI]
During the first term.

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:09.262
Weren't there some
auroras and skyfish

00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:10.722
spotted in the schoolyard?

00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:12.974
And also, like, three billion
yen was randomly found

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:14.059
in the lockers.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.103
Um, that sounds kinda familiar.

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:18.396
Okay...

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:20.106
But if any of that
actually happened,

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:21.733
then wouldn't there be‐‐

I thought you were on

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:27.364
[NAGARA]
I'm on what?

00:07:27.405 --> 00:07:28.907
Didn't you see
the Group Talk thing?

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:30.742
Cap sent you an invite, right?

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:33.370

it concerned me.

Oh, come on, man!
There's a bunch of new rules.

00:07:40.043 --> 00:07:42.879
The big one is, no super‐powers
while you're inside the school.

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:46.049
And on top of that, everybody
here has a job to do now.

00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:47.175
"New rules"?

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:50.595
We have a leader who's
in charge of everything, too!

"Leader"?

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:53.014
Yeah, dude, it's Cap!

00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:54.557
So, what's a "Group Talk"?

reading those messages!

[ASAKAZE] Why in the hell
can't we use our powers?!

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:16.204
[MACHI] Because it's something
we all decided.

00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:19.374
Huh? You guys just pressured
everyone to go along.

You're freakin' kidding!

Hey, try and cool it down.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.255
[ASAKAZE]
It's obvious.

But why not?

00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:40.385
Because that's just
the way things are.

00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:43.930

[ASAKAZE]
Guess not.

00:12:52.063 --> 00:12:54.482
So the first mystery
is the darkness.

00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:56.484
We can't observe
whatever's outside.

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:58.653
It's pure nothingness.

00:12:58.695 --> 00:13:01.322
Also, time seems
to still be moving forward

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:03.408
for us inside the building.

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:05.827
But even if time is flowing...

00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:07.829
...are we all static, somehow?

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.665
If that were the case,
her arm would never heal,

00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:13.543
and nobody here would
ever grow taller.

00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:16.254
But I know that I do
get hungry every day

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:19.924
and I can't go without sleep.

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:22.176
I don't get it!

On top of everything,
there are these super‐powers.

00:13:25.179 --> 00:13:29.142
It's so bizarre. I have
no explanation for any of it.

00:13:29.183 --> 00:13:33.563
And are we just drifting?
It's almost impossible to tell.

He refers to it as "This World,"

00:13:35.898 --> 00:13:37.650
and it seems to operate
differently than the one

00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:39.110
we came from.

00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:41.904
It has another set of rules that
govern the way things work.

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:43.406
But the big question is:

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:46.075
Why did this even
happen in the first place?

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:49.245
I remember I was going to
the library to check out a book,

00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:50.788

[SATA groans]

00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:42.288
Hey! You said this would work
and they wouldn't be able

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.081
to give us any penalties!

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:45.916
‐‐[CAP] Penalty!
‐‐[SHANGHAI] Ah!

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.543
[CAP]
And I'm just getting' warmed up.

00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:49.712
You've been like this
ever since grade school.

00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:51.047
[CAP growls]

00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:52.923
You've always been completely
lost unless you've got

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.592
some kind of clear position.

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:55.760
[CAP]
What did you say?

00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:57.053
You know what I mean.

00:18:57.094 --> 00:19:00.014
People like you just because
you can play some baseball.

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:02.975
The only reason you got
nominated was Hoshi.

00:19:03.017 --> 00:19:04.894
Shut up! Penalty!

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:08.773
Heh...

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:10.441
Penalty!

00:19:11.942 --> 00:19:13.444
Why won't it work?!

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:15.154
[ASAKAZE]
You wanna know why?!

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:18.199
Because I haven't broken
any of the rules this time.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.618
It has nothing to do with
your so‐called "power."

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.411
It's just how it is.

00:19:22.453 --> 00:19:25.331
It's the power of
"This World," right?

00:19:25.373 --> 00:19:28.334
Rules are strongly enforced
in whatever this place is.

00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:30.795
So if you understand
that's how it works,

00:19:30.836 --> 00:19:33.130
it means you're just
a regular shmuck here.

00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:35.257
[CAP] I won't accept that,
you hear me?!

00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:37.343
Everybody has to do what I say!

00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:39.136
Well, this is a mess.

00:19:40.054 --> 00:19:41.931
[NAGARA]
How do we even get out of here?

00:19:41.972 --> 00:19:44.016
[NOZOMI]
Might actually be easy.

00:19:44.058 --> 00:19:46.185

know until you try.

00:19:57.071 --> 00:19:59.573
Never mind! Everything's fine!

[ASAKAZE groans]

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:05.621
Let go of me! It's not
about the "rules," okay?

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:08.833
I've just got a job to do here!

00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:10.876
You sure... you wanna do this?

00:20:10.918 --> 00:20:12.378
Huh?

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.131
[ASAKAZE] You think it's okay
for you to break the rules?

00:20:15.172 --> 00:20:17.007
Yeah, 'course it's okay.

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:18.759
I'm the captain, aren't I?

Huh?

Poor fool.

00:20:43.743 --> 00:20:47.371
He was really only trying to do
his job as he understood it.

00:20:47.413 --> 00:20:49.290
So what's this mean?

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:51.500
Like, can anybody
give out penalties?

00:20:52.501 --> 00:20:54.587
[HOSHI]
You didn't need to know that.

00:20:54.628 --> 00:20:55.588
[ASAKAZE]
Huh...?

00:20:55.629 --> 00:20:57.214
All of you just had
to keep your mouth shut

00:20:57.256 --> 00:20:58.883
and do exactly as you're told.

Wow, you really are an idiot.

No imagination whatsoever.

00:21:06.974 --> 00:21:09.059
You obviously
don't understand a thing,

None of you will ever go back

00:21:18.694 --> 00:21:21.238

This has to be the place.

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:43.844
I see it so clearly.

00:21:52.728 --> 00:21:55.272
[NOZOMI] There must've
been a bird right here.

00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:58.025
But it seems to be
gone, somehow.

00:21:58.067 --> 00:22:00.110
I bet it went back
to its own world.

[NAGARA]
Okay, so what are you...?

00:22:04.573 --> 00:22:06.951
[NOZOMI] Hey. Would you say
that you're a sunflower,

00:22:06.992 --> 00:22:08.702
or are you a dandelion?

00:22:08.744 --> 00:22:10.538

Huh? What are you talking about?

00:22:10.579 --> 00:22:12.665
If there were a place that
shone brighter than the place

00:22:12.706 --> 00:22:15.167
you're at, would
you wanna go to it?

00:22:15.209 --> 00:22:18.504
Or would you stay where you are
and just keep staring at it?

00:22:18.546 --> 00:22:20.840

If I had to choose...

00:22:20.881 --> 00:22:22.967
Yeah?

Dandelion.

00:22:24.426 --> 00:22:25.594
I guess?
