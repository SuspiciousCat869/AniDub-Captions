00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:32.449
Ah?

00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:33.450
Ahh!

00:00:33.492 --> 00:00:37.246
[NOZOMI laughs]

00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:40.415
Hey. Meet tonight's dinner.

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:41.875
What happened?

00:00:41.917 --> 00:00:43.460
He got me pretty good.

00:00:43.502 --> 00:00:45.671
You okay?

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:48.340
Yeah. It'll heal super quick.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:52.553
[sighs]
I'm worn out.

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:53.554
Yeah.

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:55.681
‐‐[crash]

00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:01.979
There he is.

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:07.859
[NOZOMI]
Welcome back.

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.194
[RAJDHANI]
How'd it go?

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:11.947
I went as far as I could,
but there's nothing.

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:13.323
[RAJDHANI]
You didn't see anything?

00:01:13.365 --> 00:01:16.368
No islands, boats,
distant land masses?

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.369
Nothing at all?

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:18.912
Nothing.

00:01:18.954 --> 00:01:21.707
Just water that seems
to go on forever.

00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:26.295
This is a completely different
place than where we're from.

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:28.463
[NAGARA]
Hmm? What d'ya mean?

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:30.132
[RAJDHANI]
That somehow we've entered into

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:32.259
a strange new world.

00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:34.553
It's some kind
of other This World.

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:37.055
Just like when the school
was covered in darkness.

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:39.349
Yeah. It's gotta be.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.564
[KII]
Miss Mizuho?

00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:47.190
Are you in?

00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:53.905
[KII]
Yes! Just the one I wanted!

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:56.658
I'm kinda surprised
she wears makeup.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.201
Mm.

00:01:58.243 --> 00:01:59.244
Mine now.

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:02.039
She has this castle and, like,
anything else she wants.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.832
Seems fair to me.

00:02:10.297 --> 00:02:11.923
[RAJDHANI] We've been
transmitting our SOS signal

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:15.218
for a month now, and have not
received any acknowledgement,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.013
and of course,
no sign of rescue.

00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:20.015
[MACHI] We're still
connected to our network,

00:02:20.057 --> 00:02:22.768
but the pages have been
frozen since day one.

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.978
Still can't reach
the outside at all.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.523
But it's possible somebody will
eventually come and rescue us.

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:30.108
Well, maybe.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.361
But I believe there's
another way for all of us

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:34.029
to get back home.

00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:37.199
If we explore this world,
there's a good chance

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.578
we might find clues or even
a direct path to our world.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.829
Huh?

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:48.251
[RAJDHANI] Recently...
Nagara was able to find

00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:50.170
some other "gateways."

00:02:50.212 --> 00:02:52.839
These gateways that he
stumbled upon in the school,

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:55.384
led to many other
"these worlds."

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:58.595
However, those worlds are
all places that are way beyond

00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:00.055
our understanding.

00:03:00.097 --> 00:03:03.475
We humans can't
even exist in them.

00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:05.394
[sighs]

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:08.438
[MACHI] So what makes you think
we'll find a way to get home?

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.481
Good question.

00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:12.526
Well, here on the island,
if something breaks,

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:15.654
it stays broken,
like you'd expect.

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:17.614
But it's different
inside the school.

00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:19.866
If something breaks over there,
just wait a while

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:23.161
and it's back to normal,
like nothing ever happened.

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:25.622
So we can keep using
the power and water,

00:03:25.664 --> 00:03:28.750
and the emergency food supply is
an all‐you‐can‐eat buffet.

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:32.337
What's more, like the school,
we're in a kind of static state.

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.548
So if you get hurt,
you'll be back to normal

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:36.758
before you know it.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.053
It's weird, like nothing
ever happened.

00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:41.972
Which led me to this theory...

00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:43.557
The school and
the island are their own

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:46.059
totally different worlds,
and the same is true for all

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:48.770
the other new
"these worlds" we've found.

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:49.813
[gasps]

00:03:49.855 --> 00:03:52.774
[RAJDHANI] Perhaps the discovery
of "these worlds" is related

00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:55.235
to the phenomenon
that's making us drift.

00:03:55.277 --> 00:03:57.279
And if we start
to retrace that...

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.573
[NARRATOR]
Why did this drift occur?

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:01.658
[gasps]

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.285
[HOSHI] We'll end up
at what originally caused

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:05.287
this to happen.

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:07.748
[RAJDHANI]
That's right. And...

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:10.542
...hopefully before
this world sinks.

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:20.177
[KII humming]

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:21.553

Ah!

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.266

[STUDENTS murmuring]

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.731
You okay? You hurt?

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:35.400
No. I'm fine.

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:37.986
[MACHI]
Water, now! Go get some water!

00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:39.446
[CAP]
Uh, yeah!

00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:41.281
It's happening again?

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:47.496
[STUDENTS gasping]

00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:53.418

Hey, guys, I brought some water!

00:04:55.587 --> 00:04:56.797
Aw, man!

[AYA]
I'm scared...

I wanna go home...

00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:05.847
[HOSHI]
More of that blue fire.

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.141
Anyone have an idea
what's causing it?

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:10.435
[STUDENTS gasping, murmuring]

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:13.897
[HOSHI] We still don't
really know the first thing

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:15.732
about this island.

00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:18.276
So what that means is
we all have to watch out

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:20.111
for our own safety.

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:27.911

Hey. Thank you.

00:05:27.953 --> 00:05:30.747

Yeah?

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:06.616
[NAGARA] Uh. The student council
president wanted me to ask you

00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:08.368
when those supplies
would get here.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.371
Oh, uh, just a bit longer.

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:13.081

How much longer we talkin'?

00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:15.750
A day? Three days?

Ya know what? I'll just
tell her it's three days.

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:21.423
There's something else
while I'm here.

[STUDENTS whooping, laughing]

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:54.956
[HAYATO] Sucks. Why did we get
stuck doing all the grunt work?

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:58.084
Because, man, what
else would we be doing?

Do you think that's it?

00:07:07.636 --> 00:07:10.055
Well, something's weird
about that fire.

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:12.974
I mean, you think it
could be somebody's power?

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:16.102
Mizuho might know something.

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:17.938
[HAYATO]
Hmm? Really? Why?

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:19.856
[NAGARA]
I saw her in the woods earlier.

00:07:19.898 --> 00:07:22.984
She was standing
in front of a burning tree.

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:24.861
Blue flame, just like this.

00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:26.446

Whoa, seriously?!

Crazy...

00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:43.296
[KII grunts] I'm pretty sure
Mizuho is behind all this.

00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:46.299
I mean, so far, the only things
that burned was stuff

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:48.259
she got with her power.

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:49.344
You're right.

00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:52.138
And those tools that caught fire
earlier came from her, too.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.139
Hey!

00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:55.141
You also mentioned
seeing her, right?

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:57.352
You said that she was burning
a tree out in the forest!

00:07:57.394 --> 00:07:58.395
No. I said she‐‐

Yeah, it sounded
super creepy to me.

She was glaring,
then the tree caught fire!

anything, you know.

How did you get this?

Why should I?
I mean, it's the truth.

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:12.654
Nothing wrong with
making the facts known.

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:15.156
What?! This is nothing
to laugh about!

00:10:15.198 --> 00:10:17.283
Can't help but wonder
if the teacher knows.

Using library Wi‐Fi
to slander a classmate.

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:23.790
Seems like they should be
aware of this behavior.

00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:25.458
It's not their problem.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:29.379

council prez you're sorry.

Really?

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:50.525
So Mizuho's making
those blue fires?

00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:53.027
[STUDENT 02A] Yeah, it's some
kind of curse power.

That is called a "PocketGame."

It's an old‐school portable.

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:48.703
I made some toys for Mizuho, and
she gave that to me in return.

00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:51.164
What's interesting,
is it was in that fire earlier,

00:13:51.205 --> 00:13:53.833
but didn't burn,
which got me wondering.

00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:54.959
Other stuff burned,

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:57.170
so was there anything
that made this different?

00:13:57.211 --> 00:13:59.505
[NOZOMI]
Hmm. Was there?

00:13:59.547 --> 00:14:03.801
I think... It's 'cuz
I traded something for it.

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:05.803
A fair trade
exchange between us.

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:08.848
I gave Mizuho something
of similar value for this.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.768
Everything else was all stuff
I got without trading.

00:14:11.809 --> 00:14:13.603

money, aren't you?

00:14:13.644 --> 00:14:15.897

This blue fire just feels
hot to us, so don't worry,

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:41.839
it won't actually burn you.

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:42.840
That's weird.

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:44.425
You wanna know what else?

00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:47.428
Mizuho's things aren't
the only stuff that burns.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.181
I made that toy
using my power, after all.

00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:54.268
[NOZOMI] That means... the fires
aren't really Mizuho's fault.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:55.311
[RAJDHANI]
Nope.

00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:58.523
So, I take it this is another
one of This World's rules?

00:14:58.564 --> 00:14:59.524
[RAJDHANI]
Probably.

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:01.609
There are still some factors
I haven't confirmed.

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:03.778
So I'm not a hundred
percent positive.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.363
But I will say this:

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:09.367
I'm fairly certain she's not the
one behind these bizarre fires.

00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:12.370
And if that's the case,
I wish she'd just tell us.

00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:13.996
We're too dependent.

to live all on his own yet.

00:20:31.605 --> 00:20:35.568
[HAYATO] Awesome!
That's Asakaze for ya!

00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:37.278
[HOSHI]
Hmm.

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:42.616
[MIZUHO] Stuff burning.
That wasn't my fault.

00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:44.326
[STUDENTS murmuring]

00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:47.037
[MIZUHO]
Actually...

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:49.999
That money and
the island burning was me.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.084
[gasps]
Seriously?

00:20:52.126 --> 00:20:53.669
You're kidding me!

00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:57.465
So, look. I'm sorry about that.

00:20:57.506 --> 00:21:00.134
I truly am.

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:02.052
But...

00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:04.346
The rest of it, wasn't me, okay?

00:21:04.388 --> 00:21:05.848
No way!

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:08.768
[STUDENTS murmuring]

00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:10.311
[NOZOMI]
Mm‐hmm!

00:21:11.228 --> 00:21:13.522
[RAJDHANI]
So let's review.

00:21:13.564 --> 00:21:15.608
What happens if you get
something on this island

00:21:15.649 --> 00:21:17.109
without paying for it?

00:21:18.986 --> 00:21:21.363
[RAJDHANI]
Hmm. Ah‐‐ Yikes!

00:21:21.405 --> 00:21:24.241
We don't know why,
but it burns up.

00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:26.494
As long as we know
that's how it works here,

00:21:26.535 --> 00:21:28.204
we just gotta learn
to live with it.

00:21:28.245 --> 00:21:29.955
It's called adaptability.

00:21:29.997 --> 00:21:33.459
Therefore, today, I'm announcing
a revolutionary new app

00:21:33.501 --> 00:21:35.503
which will help us adapt‐‐

00:21:35.544 --> 00:21:38.172
It's called HYO‐RYU‐COIN!

00:21:38.214 --> 00:21:39.924
[STUDENTS murmuring]

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:41.801
[RAJDHANI] This is an
electronic payment system

00:21:41.842 --> 00:21:43.219
that uses the 'net.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:46.931
You can open your own ledger
and manage asset transactions.

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:50.267
With this, we won't be going
against the island's rules.

00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:53.979
And can buy stuff without
the risk of it catching fire.

00:21:54.021 --> 00:21:57.316
[STUDENTS gasping, murmuring]

00:22:05.783 --> 00:22:06.992
Huh?

00:22:08.494 --> 00:22:10.454
Here, for you.

00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:12.873
Yeah?

00:22:18.587 --> 00:22:20.422
Meow?

00:22:20.464 --> 00:22:23.467
[MIZUHO] Thanks a lot
for finding my cat.

00:22:24.552 --> 00:22:26.095
Hey, um...

00:22:26.136 --> 00:22:28.639
We gotta square up. How much?

00:22:30.432 --> 00:22:32.685
[MIZUHO]
Nothing.

00:22:32.726 --> 00:22:36.355
Yep. This one'll
be on the house.

00:22:36.397 --> 00:22:37.982
Oh...

00:22:39.275 --> 00:22:41.235
[seagull crying]

00:22:41.277 --> 00:22:43.863
[ASAKAZE]
So, uh. What do we do now?

00:22:43.904 --> 00:22:46.991
[RAJDHANI sighs] I wasn't
expecting this world to go back

00:22:47.032 --> 00:22:48.117
to the way it was.

00:22:48.158 --> 00:22:50.494
[NOZOMI]
Hey, guys?

00:22:50.536 --> 00:22:53.706
I can see the way out.

00:22:53.747 --> 00:22:55.040
Seriously?

00:22:55.082 --> 00:22:58.794
[NOZOMI]
Mm‐hmm. I see the way home.

00:22:58.836 --> 00:23:01.338
I thought I could just
reach out and touch it.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:07.303
But now... it's so far off.
Like a pinpoint.

00:23:10.222 --> 00:23:12.057
[NOZOMI]
"Compass."

00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:13.851
I guess that's my power.
