[MACHI] Speaking of,
this place is pretty unfair.

I mean, there's one person

00:02:09.338 --> 00:02:12.257

Uh, what does that mean?

00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:00.133

So stupid! The guy
acts like a hotshot,

water and say it tastes good.

Wait. If you wanna
practice baseball,

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:13.730
does that mean you have
a place to play?

in the world of Monkey Mountain.

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:11.454
It all started when the rules of
the game and a ball and bat

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:13.582
were first gifted to them.

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:15.959

of the league.

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:24.092
This includes
the legendary home run king,

00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:27.304
who batted an unprecedented
80 home runs in one year.

00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:28.847
Steroid Monkey.

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.682

bested Monkey River,

the "god of batting's"
career batting average

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:34.019

The miracle hitting machine.
Upper Monkey.

00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:38.940
And the greatest catcher
of the Bigfoot era:

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:39.983
Mister Monkey.

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:41.818
Who, as manager,
would go on to break the record

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.070
for most league wins,
with a legendary

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:46.698
ten‐season‐long streak!

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.659
Then came the golden age
of the M‐League.

00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:51.620
A miracle monkey
came along and surpassed

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:54.205

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:55.624
Monkey Blue!

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:58.084
This maverick was the
only one with blue hair,

00:06:58.126 --> 00:07:01.463
who, despite facing cruel
discrimination and persecution,

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:04.299
triumphed over his peers
with devastating talent,

00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:06.760
ultimately becoming a hero,
and a symbol of hope

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:08.094
for the monkeys!

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:10.263
Still a rookie,
Blue drove the king,

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:11.932
Steroid Monkey, to retirement.

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:14.434
Breaking his bat,
as well as his heart.

00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:18.021
Then, with his mighty pitching
arm, Blue led the underdog team

00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:22.025
Monkey Club to victory, stopping
Bigfoot's streak at ten.

00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:24.569
The public accepted his unique
hair color and the era

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:27.155
of Monkey Blue
had officially begun!

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:30.200
But then, the great
tragedy happened.

00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:34.454
A near‐perfect game was ruined
and a monkey was killed.

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:36.998

to show up or anything.

00:07:57.686 --> 00:08:00.522
You need a specific piece of
gear if you wanna see 'em.

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:01.523
We do?

00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:03.316

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:06.027
That's right.

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:09.364
If you wanna see them, you gotta
use one of these puppies.

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:12.200
A Monkey Getter.
Wanna borrow it?

00:08:12.242 --> 00:08:14.119
[BOTH gasp]

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.204
No! No way in hell!

00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:17.414
Mm!

‐‐[NAGARA sighs]

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.168
[MIZUHO] Fine. Name your
price‐‐I'll pay it. See?

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:25.797
That won't help, she just
doesn't like you two, I guess.

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:28.466
What's her problem?
We just wanna see the monkeys‐‐

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.176
why's she gotta
keep that from us?

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:31.761
What's our move? We steal it?

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:34.014
Threaten 'em?
Fight 'em? Trick 'em?

00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:35.098
Can you not?

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.641
Then what do you suggest?

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:39.394
Hey. How do you know about
the monkeys in the first place?

00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:40.854
I'm curious.

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:42.689
During baseball
practice with Cap,

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:44.733
he told us all about them.

00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:46.568
‐‐But, uh...
‐‐Huh?

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:48.528
Does that thing actually
let you see them?

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.405
Why? Are you doubting me?

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:53.450
What? No.
I've got no reason to.

00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:55.285
I guess I can't blame you.

00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:57.787
It does look like just
a regular flashlight.

00:08:57.829 --> 00:09:00.665
But it's not. If you
shine it on yourself,

00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:02.542
then you're able
to see the monkeys.

00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:05.670
Or rather, the world the
monkeys live in, technically.

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:06.755
[NAGARA]
Huh.

00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:09.591
Y'know what?
We were teammates.

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:12.594
Yeah, you can take it,
for old time's sake.

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:15.138
Seriously?

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.723
On one condition.

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:18.600
You've already
got some practice in.

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:22.270
So, play against me, and if you
win, then you can borrow it.

00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:24.481
A one‐inning game.

00:09:24.522 --> 00:09:27.442
If any of you actually hit one
of my pitches without fouling,

00:09:27.484 --> 00:09:29.986
then you guys win.
Whaddya say?

00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:31.029
Yeah, no thanks.

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:32.363
Challenge accepted!

Heh. That's more like it.

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:39.621
But I'm not playing for nothing.
I want something in return.

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:41.706
If you guys lose...

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:44.250

Wait, but I‐‐!

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:49.631
Then it's settled!

00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:58.473
C'mon, you're not even close!

00:09:58.515 --> 00:10:00.934
Stop dropping your elbow
and keep your head up!

00:10:04.813 --> 00:10:06.815
I don't think I have
a chance against him.

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:08.817
[CAP]
Welp. I don't disagree.

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:11.236
So what's the deal?
Is he that good?

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:12.821
Yeah, the guy's a prodigy.

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:15.490
He's already had some pros
come asking about him.

00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:17.367
Wow. Then he must be good.

00:10:17.408 --> 00:10:18.368
[MIZUHO]
Hey!

00:10:18.409 --> 00:10:20.662
Talkin' like you've
already lost isn't helping!

00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:22.205
You better at least try to win!

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:25.041
If you don't believe
in yourself, who will?

00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:31.339
[NAGARA] I've never counted
on myself for anything.

00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:33.049
[MIZUHO groans]

00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:35.176
'Cuz I can't.

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:36.845
[CAP] Hey, man, you never
know what's gonna happen

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:38.012
in a real game.

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:41.349
Just do your best
and hope for a miracle.

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:44.185
By the way, what did Ace
want if he wins this?

00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:47.021
Oh, nothing worth mentioning.

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:48.940
[NOZOMI]
Hmm.

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:50.692
[RAJDHANI]
You're not playing baseball?

00:10:50.733 --> 00:10:52.610
They'd have it in
the bag with you there.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.612
[ASAKAZE] Why would I
wanna see some monkeys?

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:56.281
Or that idiot.

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:59.409
I'm just curious about the
gadget, the flashlight‐‐

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:00.827
the "Monkey Getter"!

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:03.830
If it actually exists, it'll
completely change the way

00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:05.290
I view the world.

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:09.085
Doesn't interest me. As soon
as Nagara masters his power,

00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:10.837
we'll be out of here anyway.

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:15.091
[RAJDHANI] Mm... I don't know
if it'll be quite that simple.

00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:18.970
[CAP] It had been
Blue's greatest season yet.

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:21.139
Every game, he pitched
the full nine innings

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:22.557
and came out on top.

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:24.601
That's a league‐high 32 wins,

00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:27.020
with the team claiming
its second title in a row.

00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:29.647
Then, in the final game
of the season,

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:33.568
Blue was closing in on pitching
an absolutely perfect game!

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:35.320
Monkey Club's lead was huge.

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:38.114
16‐0 going into
the final inning.

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:40.033
Bottom of the 9th, two outs.

00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:43.578
Blue had struck out 26 batters
on 80 pitches and served

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.997
the last batter two strikes
in quick order!

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:48.124
The stadium was packed,
but the crowd was waiting

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:51.169
with bated breath for the last
pitch and resulting call.

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:54.047
All eyes were locked on Blue,
each monkey watching

00:11:54.088 --> 00:11:56.132
every minute move he made!

00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:59.177
They were all certain they were
about to witness a perfect game!

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:00.511
No doubt!

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:03.223
And yet, there was
unease in the air.

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:05.600
In the moment,
only one monkey felt it.

00:12:05.642 --> 00:12:09.520
The umpire, who wasn't used to
that kind of pressure yet.

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:11.981
Then the world went off‐kilter.

00:12:12.023 --> 00:12:14.025
The 81st pitch!

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:16.110
It was by no means
a careless pitch.

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:17.654
Blue was too good for that.

00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:19.572
The world itself had slipped!

00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:21.658
And no, before you say anything,
I'm not just being

00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:24.369
biased towards Blue.
It actually happened!

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:27.664
The world around them moved!
Just a little bit.

00:12:27.705 --> 00:12:29.332
But it's the truth!

00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:33.461
Whether it was a strike
or a ball was up for debate.

00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:35.213
It could have slightly
missed the strike zone,

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:36.798
but it was anyone's guess.

00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:38.925
And the umpire making the
call was the one monkey

00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:41.302
in that stadium‐‐
No, anywhere,

00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:44.138
who wouldn't even consider
that the world slipped!

[CAP] All together,
the crowd rose to their feet!

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:54.941
They started tearing out their
hair and stomping the dirt!

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:57.068
They were booing
as loud as they could!

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:00.280
The umpire firmly refused
to check the video replay.

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:02.824
Blue was clearly upset
and charged the umpire!

00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:04.117
"That was a strike!"

00:13:04.158 --> 00:13:06.411
But the umpire quietly
shook his head.

00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:07.662
"Are you out of your mind?!

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:10.957
That pitch would have sealed
an absolutely perfect game!"

00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:12.292
The umpire replied.

00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:13.501
"I am aware."

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:14.752
"You're missing the point!

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:17.046
Why didn't you just
call that ball a strike?

We all know who's
gonna win at this point!

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.551
On top of that, the other
team's thrown in the towel!

00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:23.553
The batter knows
he couldn't hit it!

It didn't matter what
you called that pitch,

00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:26.848
the game is basically over!

00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:28.558
So why wouldn't you
just call it a strike?!

00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:30.268
What was the point
of doing that?

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.562
I mean, you had to have
heard the cheers of hope

00:13:32.603 --> 00:13:35.189
and anticipation
this whole time!

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:37.150

as I do that this isn't

00:13:37.191 --> 00:13:39.360
the outcome they wanted!"

00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:42.363
"I am aware of that, as well."

00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:44.198

trembling as he spoke.

"Right here, right now,
I am the rules."

00:14:20.943 --> 00:14:22.779
Blue knew the truth, too.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.615
The replay was
on the big screen.

00:14:25.656 --> 00:14:28.326
The fact was,
due to the world slipping,

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:31.954
the ball had missed the strike
zone by no more than a micron!

00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:36.334
But Blue couldn't bring himself
to accept that decision.

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:39.837
When the game resumed,
Blue pitched the exact same way.

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:41.464
He matched the speed perfectly,

00:14:41.506 --> 00:14:43.966
and the course was identical,
three times in a row.

00:14:44.008 --> 00:14:46.302

his head beaten in,

limb from limb.

00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:08.801
are held back by
the whims of the mediocre?

00:16:10.928 --> 00:16:12.847
[CAP]
Foul!

Her form is pretty, but crude.

00:16:17.226 --> 00:16:18.811
At her level,
she'll never even see

00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:20.813
my lightning fastball coming.

Good luck.

That's strike one!

00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:50.301
[CAP]
Strike two!

00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:55.598
So. What do you think
of my pitching, man?

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.352
It's really good. I doubt
there's any way I can hit one.

00:16:59.393 --> 00:17:01.938
[ACE]
You just don't feel like trying.

00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:04.023
I know my limits.

00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:05.733
[ACE growls]

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:11.447
Why am I not...?

00:17:12.406 --> 00:17:14.742
‐‐[NAGARA grunts]
‐‐[CAP] Ball!

00:17:14.784 --> 00:17:16.410
Hey, watch where
you're throwing that!

00:17:16.452 --> 00:17:18.579
Yeah, you were trying
to hit him with that one!

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:19.580
Eject him!

00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:21.332
The guy is so lame, I swear!

00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:23.084
Yeah, he's lucky he's handsome.

00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:24.252
Hey, you okay?

00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:26.379
[ACE]
I gave baseball to the monkeys.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.047
I did.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.301
[ACE]
I'm special.

00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:36.305
[ACE] If you lose,
then you have to return us

to our world as
soon as possible.

00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:40.476
And don't try to
tell me you can't.

00:17:40.518 --> 00:17:43.938

our "savior," aren't you?

Ah. Whaddya mean? I'm not any‐‐

00:17:46.774 --> 00:17:49.860
[ACE] Just looking at you
now makes me wanna puke.

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:52.822
I can't believe someone
like you got chosen.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.492
[ACE]
This world is all upside down.

00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:59.954
Bring us back to the one
where I'm properly appreciated.

00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:02.832
That's what your power's
really meant for.

00:18:02.873 --> 00:18:04.959
[NAGARA]
I... don't know if I can.

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:07.962
Do it. Even if it kills you.

00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:12.508
[gasps]
What? A monkey?

00:18:14.302 --> 00:18:16.053
[NAGARA]
A one‐armed monkey...

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:17.346
[ACE gasps]

00:18:17.388 --> 00:18:19.390
[CAP]
How did you know he had one arm?

00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:21.559
Can you see the umpire?

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:36.741
[NAGARA] You... wanted to be a
baseball player too, didn't you?

00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:38.618
But... you couldn't.

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:41.829
[NAGARA] Yet you were
still drawn to the fairness

00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:46.125
of baseball, cruel as it may be,
and became an umpire.

00:18:49.378 --> 00:18:50.755
[NAGARA]
You were right there,

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:53.466
protecting the game
that whole time.

00:18:53.507 --> 00:18:57.053
[gasps] What was killed
wasn't the umpire...

00:18:57.094 --> 00:18:59.305
‐‐[ACE] Uh?
‐‐It was baseball itself.

00:18:59.347 --> 00:19:01.140
[ACE] Huh? What are
you talking abou‐‐?

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:03.059
I saw it.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:06.270

Damn. So he really can do it.

00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:07.271

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:10.149
[ACE] Trash.
Don't get full of yourself.

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:12.610
That's it.

00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:17.114
You got this!

00:19:20.451 --> 00:19:21.410
Strike!

00:19:21.452 --> 00:19:22.912
Batter out!

00:19:22.953 --> 00:19:25.581
Ugh! You idiot!

00:19:27.291 --> 00:19:28.751
[HAYATO]
That was awesome, Nagara!

00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:30.002
[SHIIBA]
And crazy!

00:19:30.044 --> 00:19:32.296
[NOZOMI] Too bad.
But that was a nice swing.

00:19:32.338 --> 00:19:34.090
[NAGARA]
Mm. Mm‐hmm.

00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:36.676
Guess we lose.
No monkeys for us.

00:19:36.717 --> 00:19:37.885
Thirsty?

00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:38.928
[NAGARA]
Thanks.

00:19:38.969 --> 00:19:40.680
Hey, you've got
something stuck on you.

00:19:40.721 --> 00:19:42.807
[NAGARA grunts]
What the‐‐?

00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:44.225
What is this?

00:19:44.266 --> 00:19:45.810
[MIZUHO]
It's not from my cats.

00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:46.936
Some kinda fur?

00:19:46.977 --> 00:19:48.604
[CAP]
When did it get stuck to you?

00:19:48.646 --> 00:19:50.731
[ACE]
Here to make me feel better?

00:19:50.773 --> 00:19:53.275
This isn't where
we're supposed to be.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:59.615
[CAP] Looks like today's the
last day of life on the island.

00:19:59.657 --> 00:20:00.825
[CAP]
I'm gonna miss it.

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:03.285
Oh. I suppose.

00:20:03.327 --> 00:20:05.538
[CAP]
Y'know. For awhile now,

00:20:05.579 --> 00:20:07.873
I've actually been thinking
of quitting baseball.

00:20:07.915 --> 00:20:08.874
Why?

00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:12.086
I'm nowhere near talented enough
to play in the big leagues.

00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:14.672
I know that better than anyone.

00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:17.633
A long time ago, we all just
played for the fun of it,

00:20:17.675 --> 00:20:19.510
kinda like the monkeys.

00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:21.929
But before we knew it, it
became about whether we had

00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:25.891
the talent, or if it would
get us into college.

00:20:25.933 --> 00:20:29.395
And soon enough, that was all
we could really think about.

00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:31.939
But it's funny.
Watching those monkeys play,

00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:35.109
I couldn't sit still,
I was drawn in again!

00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:38.988
I dunno how to say it, but for
the first time in a while,

00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:42.199
I felt like...
"I wanna play baseball!"

00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:43.826
And by the time
I realized that,

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:46.662
this field was
basically finished.

00:20:46.704 --> 00:20:48.122
It's strange, isn't it?

00:20:48.164 --> 00:20:49.790
I don't have
the chops for baseball,

00:20:49.832 --> 00:20:52.084
but it's all I ever think about.

00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:56.046
[NAGARA]
That's not so strange.

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:57.465
[CAP]
It's not?

00:20:57.506 --> 00:20:58.924
[NAGARA]
Mm.

00:21:09.059 --> 00:21:11.937
[NOZOMI] Maybe. All I know
is it's an amazing power.

00:21:11.979 --> 00:21:13.397
We can go anywhere!

00:21:13.439 --> 00:21:14.440

Really?

00:21:14.482 --> 00:21:16.859
I must admit...
I have my doubts.

[RAJDHANI]
She's not lying.

00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:19.987
But I'm not sure
it'll be exactly like

00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:22.406
everyone's imagining, either.

00:21:22.448 --> 00:21:24.325
Nagara's gotten to the point
where he can control

00:21:24.366 --> 00:21:25.993
his warping power.

00:21:26.035 --> 00:21:28.746
Which means we're
finally out of this place.

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:30.956
Now, ready to go back home?

Can we speed this up?

That's enough showing off, dude.

And that pretty much
clears that up.

00:22:29.598 --> 00:22:31.892
For starters, Nagara
has the power to move

00:22:31.934 --> 00:22:34.186
to other THIS Worlds.

00:22:34.228 --> 00:22:36.355
He also can't choose
where he goes.

00:22:36.397 --> 00:22:39.149
I mean, It's hard to imagine
he'd choose to come back

00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:41.443
