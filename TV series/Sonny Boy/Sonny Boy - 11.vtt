00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:10.344
[MIZUHO groans]

00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:14.473
Where did I put that thing?
Gotta be around here somewhere.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.143
[MIZUHO]
I know it is...

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:19.436
A‐ha!

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:23.941
[MIZUHO]
Found it.

00:03:47.853 --> 00:03:49.271
'Kay.

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:06.079
[NAGARA, MIZUHO gasping,
yelping]

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:10.041
[BOTH gasp]

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.421
‐‐[MIZUHO gasps]
‐‐[NAGARA] Rajdhani!

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.933
[MIZUHO]
Well, that's... interesting.

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:29.728
You're going home, am I right?

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.315
[BOTH]
Mm.

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:35.859
Well, I think I could
help you out with that.

00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:39.321
I've had some ideas on that
subject over the years.

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:42.240
[NAGARA]
Hmm. I'll bet!

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:45.911
Wow...

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:48.413
It's really been 2,000
years since you left?

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:50.207
[MIZUHO]
This picture...

00:04:50.248 --> 00:04:52.334
what happened to that
cool ship you had?

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:54.169
Now, now.

00:04:54.211 --> 00:04:56.463
All questions will
be answered in time.

00:04:56.505 --> 00:04:58.965
We have a lot
of catching up to do.

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:00.967
‐‐Yeah.
‐‐Huh?

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:02.260
[RAJDHANI]
This is incredible!

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:04.763
Nagara did you
put all this together?

00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:05.889
Great work!

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:09.351
[RAJDHANI] But if we put this
over here and this here...

00:05:09.392 --> 00:05:11.269
That's it, perfect!

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.785
[MIZUHO groaning]

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:17.419
[RAJDHANI] What do you think?
Pretty awesome, yeah?

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:23.884
‐‐Awesome!
‐‐[NAGARA] Mm‐hmm. Oh yeah!

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:26.344
Awesome!

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:29.472
[RAJDHANI] All righty.
That part's done with.

00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:30.849
‐‐[speaker crackles]
‐‐[RAJDHANI] Hmm?

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:34.811
[RAJDHANI]
Nagara!

00:06:34.853 --> 00:06:37.105
You think you've
got it from here?

00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:39.107
[NAGARA]
Mm. Sure thing.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.575
'Sup, Mizuho?

00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:49.784
Uh...

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.872
[MIZUHO] Don't need the
big control room?

00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:57.042
[RAJDHANI]
Mm... No, this is just perfect.

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:58.293
Besides...

00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:02.797
...from this little spot,
I'll see it with my own eyes.

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:03.965
Okay.

00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:07.052
Guess that means you really
aren't coming home with us.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.971
Nope. Gonna plant myself here.

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:17.062
Do what you want,

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:19.689
but did you ever feel homesick?

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:22.442
I mean, you were alone
for 2,000 years.

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:26.112
Homesick, huh?
That takes me back.

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:28.823
I did travel through a world
filled with these images

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:31.284
that were extremely
close to my old home.

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:34.037
It was so similar,
it was almost shocking,

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:37.248
but somehow mysterious.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.501
It was unsettling.
For the first time

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:42.087
since the whole thing
started all those years ago,

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:43.880
I felt nostalgic.

00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:48.635
[RAJDHANI] It's funny.
I actually named that world

00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:49.844
"Homesick."

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:52.430
[MIZUHO] Do you mean it was
like our old world, or what?

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:55.392
Yeah, but still different
in a weird way.

00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:59.104
It was "our‐world‐like"
but not like "our world."

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:00.230
[MIZUHO]
Mm?

00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:01.731
The master of that world...

00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:03.942
He couldn't escape
his old memories‐‐

00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:07.278
kept recreating his homeland.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.365
The most bizarre thing about it,
was no matter how far in

00:08:10.407 --> 00:08:14.244
you looked, you wouldn't
see another soul.

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:16.162
[MIZUHO]
Sounds so lonely to me.

00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:18.832
But then, at the same time,

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:20.959
the whole thing
radically changed.

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:24.629
There were images. Yeah, all of
this one female student.

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:26.548
Really threw me for a loop.

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:27.590
[gasps]

00:08:27.632 --> 00:08:30.051
Suddenly, there's
a vision of beauty.

00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:33.263
Apparently, it was the likeness
of his old girlfriend.

00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:35.432
Now this is getting juicy!

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:38.685
Yeah, right? I had to
give in to my curiosity.

00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:41.229
So I just checked her
with my Scoop Scope.

00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:44.774
It's a kind of a power
holdover I developed myself.

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:46.026
[MIZUHO]
Go on.

00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:48.236
Turns out she wasn't near
as pretty as the images

00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:49.487
made her seem.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:52.574
[laughs] Those Love goggles
usually come with

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:54.701
a strong prescription.

00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:58.830
Surprisingly enough, the girl
really did love him, too.

00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:01.166
I looked more closely
at the other images.

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:04.461
I actually knew the place
he was from and, of course,

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:07.130
it wasn't nearly as charming
as the way his depictions

00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:09.132
would have you believe.

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:14.304
Long story short, the guy
couldn't seem to accept reality.

00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:17.640
His girlfriend wanted him to
be in the real world with her.

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:20.685
Like, be a part of
the world that was actually

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:21.770
in front of him.

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:26.107
But he couldn't bring himself to
do it, so, she ended up leaving.

00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:28.943
With her gone,
he started to paint pictures

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:31.196
of her‐‐he was like
a man possessed.

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:34.240
Those renditions of her
were what I first saw.

00:09:34.282 --> 00:09:35.742
The whole experience was like

00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:38.787
being hit in
the face by reality.

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:41.081
But it made me wonder
if I myself was living in

00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:43.416
some kind of fantasy as well.

00:09:46.377 --> 00:09:47.796
I guess you could say...

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:50.048
...she didn't wanna relive
memories with him.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.634
She wanted them to create
a future together.

00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:54.344
Go into the unknown.

00:09:57.931 --> 00:09:59.682
[RAJDHANI]
That's exactly it.

00:09:59.724 --> 00:10:01.976
He became a prisoner
of those memories.

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:04.604
They took over his entire world.

00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:06.314
[MIZUHO]
Did he... die?

00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:08.691
[RAJDHANI]
Hmm. Now, that's hard to say.

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:12.112
The concept of death
is different in this world.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.660
[MIZUHO] Death seems
so dark and scary to me.

00:10:18.701 --> 00:10:22.956
I get this tight feeling in
my chest when I think about it.

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:25.875
Was it like that for Nozomi...?

00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:27.585
Was she afraid...?

00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:44.352
[RAJDHANI] So tell me,
have you gone to see

00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:46.437
the world where Nozomi died?

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:48.106
[NAGARA]
Mm.

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:50.817
[RAJDHANI] Then how did you
verify that she's actually gone?

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:57.198
Ah, I see, one of Mizuho's cats?

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.783
Mrowr.

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:02.745
Of course I can't explain it...

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:05.290
...but she knows
things like that.

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:11.337
[RAJDHANI] In one world,
there was this inventor.

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:13.715
The other students living
there believed they were

00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:17.010
all children of God, so they
felt it was incumbent on them

00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:18.970
to keep their bodies
and minds pure.

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:21.598
They tried to achieve this
by refraining from harming

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:26.227
any living thing‐‐not eating
meat or killing any plants.

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:28.563
That was a world of fasting.

00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:31.733
Sounds to me like
a difficult place to live.

00:11:31.774 --> 00:11:35.403
Yeah, you'd think so, but they
were surprisingly happy.

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:38.281
Their civilization flourished‐‐
they created great works

00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:42.160
of beauty and had a lot
of power holdovers.

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:45.455
Huh... Oh, really?

00:11:45.496 --> 00:11:47.207
[RAJDHANI]
Well, think about it a little.

00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:51.044
Hunger isn't that
big of a deal to us.

00:11:51.085 --> 00:11:54.172
Anyway, there was a guy on
the outskirts of that world,

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:56.799
who was obsessed with dying.

00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:59.844
Or rather, he was trying
to break up the static nature

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:03.306
of this realm we're in
by inventing death.

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:04.974
That's an odd way.

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:08.770
Yeah, his theory was that
death was the only means

00:12:08.811 --> 00:12:10.813
to affect the stasis.

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:15.360
In theory, I admired his rather
unorthodox thought process.

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:18.655
Setting aside the moral issue,
this was a way to directly

00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:21.074
challenge the rules
that govern this world.

00:12:21.115 --> 00:12:22.533
[RAJDHANI]
But in reality...

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:24.911
The guy was like
the devil incarnate.

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:28.790
He reviled God, burned down the
forests, gorged himself on meat,

00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:32.377
and treated his ascetic brethren
with a great deal of contempt.

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:35.672
He abused the stasis
to commit unspeakable acts

00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:38.049
in the name of experimentation.

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:41.719
Man, I dunno. He just
sounds like a psychopath.

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:45.473
[RAJDHANI] Yes. He really was
an utterly despicable person.

00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:48.309
I wanted to do him in myself.

00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:52.313
But in the end, he successfully
invented "death."

00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:53.940
Mission accomplished.

00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:56.985
Since he apparently wanted
to die more than anything,

00:12:57.026 --> 00:12:59.570
he couldn't resist
his own invention.

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:02.490
It worked and he got
what he wished for.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.451
[RAJDHANI]
Mm‐hmm.

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:08.413
I found myself facing
his invention one day.

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:12.166
[RAJDHANI]
It was strange.

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:15.086
I could feel his
invitation to sit.

00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:18.923
What'd you do?

00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:24.095
[RAJDHANI]
Interestingly enough...

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:26.764
He didn't look much different
from before he died.

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:29.642
But there were slight
changes that began to appear

00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:31.269
with every passing day.

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:33.730
Most noticeably in his demeanor.

00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:37.317
Instead of railing against
what he saw as imperfections,

00:13:37.358 --> 00:13:40.153
he could accept them.
His hatred had waned.

00:13:40.194 --> 00:13:42.155
He had become
more like the Buddha,

00:13:42.196 --> 00:13:46.117
leaving behind his
earthly desires.

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:49.412
The inventor had
transcended this world.

00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:52.915
He came to realize that once
he moved beyond such things,

00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:55.585
that was the end
of his life as it was.

00:13:55.626 --> 00:13:59.505
He had achieved a form
of "death" in this world.

00:14:00.757 --> 00:14:03.301
Anyway, I decided not to sit.

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:06.763
So that guy...
Do you think he hated himself?

00:14:06.804 --> 00:14:09.474
Huh... I'm not quite sure.

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:13.061
And I don't truly know why he
was so obsessed with dying.

00:14:13.102 --> 00:14:15.730
But after all these
years I've been alive,

00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:17.940
there's one thing I've
come to understand.

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:20.485
As you keep building
experiences and see the world,

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:22.487
something changes inside you.

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:26.115
Individualized meanings
become more diluted, in a way.

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:29.452
There's a kind of homogenization
you can observe in all things.

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:31.746
I don't know if
I'm more apathetic,

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:35.625
but as this balance shifts, life
is much less personal to me.

00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:37.960
Ultimately, I'll
become nothingness.

00:14:40.171 --> 00:14:42.465
[RAJDHANI]
What's me is falling away.

00:14:42.507 --> 00:14:45.927
Perhaps, like Nozomi,
I'll just be a form.

00:14:45.968 --> 00:14:47.804
But I'll be still in
this static existence,

00:14:47.845 --> 00:14:50.223
just in a different state.

00:14:50.264 --> 00:14:51.599
And if that's "death" here...

00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:54.435
Seems the same to me
as in our world.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.313
It's true.

00:14:57.355 --> 00:15:00.191
The soul is just a human
construct‐‐the self exists

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:03.653
for no reason, and it
ultimately ceases to be.

00:15:03.694 --> 00:15:06.197
Life's a constant cycle
of vain endeavors.

00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:11.119
[RAJDHANI] But at the same time,
since it is meaningless,

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.663
then this moment
of becoming, is a precious

00:15:13.704 --> 00:15:16.624
and beautiful thing, indeed.

00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:19.836
That one moment belongs
to that person alone.

00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:22.839
She'll never come back.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.298
[gasps]

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:27.176
[RAJDHANI]
However...

00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:36.144
[NAGARA gasps]

00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:38.312
[RAJDHANI]
Her will is still with us.

00:15:45.027 --> 00:15:46.904
[NAGARA]
So how much is done?

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:48.573
[RAJDHANI]
The cats are doing their best,

00:15:48.614 --> 00:15:52.577
but I'd say about
it's about 20% complete.

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:55.246
I reached out to
the others in our group.

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:58.541
But everyone said
they weren't going back.

00:15:58.583 --> 00:16:01.252
The plan turned
into just us three.

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:04.547
I mean, Nozomi was going, too.

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:08.801
[NOZOMI] So if we do it this way
and go back to our old world,

00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:11.179
we might not end up
being who we've become.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.555
Am I right?

00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:15.224
[NAGARA] Hmm. Things will
be different in a lot of ways,

00:16:15.266 --> 00:16:19.061
but I don't know exactly how.
And it'll be two years later.

00:16:19.103 --> 00:16:23.024
There's a chance
I'll be dead there, as well.

00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:24.275
[NAGARA]
Yeah...

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:25.359
[NOZOMI]
Whatever.

00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:28.321
If I'm gonna spin my wheels
thinking about what could be,

00:16:28.362 --> 00:16:31.574
there's a big chance
that I'll be alive, yeah?

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:33.242
Everything we've
been through here,

00:16:33.284 --> 00:16:37.163
could all just disappear
in an instant, and that means...

00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:38.164
[NOZOMI]
Hmm?

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:39.373
Nothin'.

00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:43.961
[NOZOMI]
If this plan works out...

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:45.922
...what's the first
thing you'll do?

00:16:45.963 --> 00:16:48.633
[NAGARA] Hmm... I haven't
really thought about that.

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:51.219
You're kidding me. But why not?

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.514
Well, because we may
not even remember this.

00:16:54.555 --> 00:16:57.308
Don't wanna spin my wheels
thinking about the could'ves.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.477
[NOZOMI] Hmm. So it's
a stupid waste of time

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:01.229
to be thinking about it?

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:04.774
[NAGARA] It's just not
that big of a deal, is all.

00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:07.735
[NOZOMI chuckles] I don't care,
'cause I'll be chowing down

00:17:07.777 --> 00:17:09.904
on Soleil omurice,
something with a ton of

00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:12.740
glacee strawberries on it,
then I'll eat Chinese noodles

00:17:12.782 --> 00:17:14.158
from Hatsune until I pop.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.493
[laughing]

00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:18.829
You see?
It's really no big deal.

00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:23.668
And after that... I'm gonna go
to the corner of the staff room,

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:26.921
find that sullen faced boy,
grab him by the lapels,

00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:28.631
and ask him a question.

00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:32.635
[NAGARA]
What's the question?

00:17:32.677 --> 00:17:33.886
A simple one.

00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:37.431
"Do you want to be friends
with me once again?" Yep.

00:17:37.473 --> 00:17:38.975
[NAGARA sighs]

00:17:39.016 --> 00:17:43.396
[NOZOMI] A very simple question
with a simple answer, hopefully.

00:17:43.437 --> 00:17:46.857
To be honest, I just don't see
it being as simple as you do.

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:48.234
Huh?

00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:50.486
[NAGARA]
I don't know...

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:51.988
Why not?

00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:55.866
'Cause, I... Because the truth
is, you and I would've

00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:58.286
never become friends
in the first place.

00:17:58.327 --> 00:18:00.329
You'll have torn up
your textbook alone

00:18:00.371 --> 00:18:03.291
and I'll have abandoned that
bird without a second thought.

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:06.919
You can't be sure.

00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:10.464
We've made a lot of progress
since then anyway.

00:18:10.506 --> 00:18:12.466
All the things
that've happened here.

00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:14.885
None of it happened there,
so we'll forget it!

00:18:16.178 --> 00:18:18.097
‐‐[NAGARA gasps]
‐‐[NOZOMI] Maybe.

00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:20.891
But we did go through
a lot together.

00:18:23.686 --> 00:18:29.400
So, my idea‐‐if one of us
remembers, they have to do this.

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:32.945
Hold out your hand
and ask to be friends, okay?

00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:34.572
It's easy, right?

00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:38.909
Now, promise that
you won't refuse me.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.289
[NAGARA]
Mm.

00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:49.795
[NAGARA sobbing]

00:18:49.837 --> 00:18:53.341
I've learned much about life
and the nature of the universe,

00:18:53.382 --> 00:18:58.137
however, all I know to do
for a friend crying in despair,

00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:00.181
is sit beside them.

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:04.560
[MIZUHO]
Ohh...

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:06.020
[NAGARA gasps]

00:19:06.062 --> 00:19:07.438
[MIZUHO grunts]

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.607
[GEN]
Mrr...

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:11.025
Come, on!

00:19:11.067 --> 00:19:12.193
[GEN]
Mrowr. Meow!

00:19:12.234 --> 00:19:14.070
‐‐[RAJDHANI chuckles]
‐‐[laughs]

00:19:14.111 --> 00:19:16.197
[cackles]

00:19:16.238 --> 00:19:18.115
[NAGARA]
Hey, Raj.

00:19:18.157 --> 00:19:20.076
You have a second?

00:19:20.117 --> 00:19:21.702
[RAJDHANI]
What is it?

00:19:21.744 --> 00:19:25.956
I've got something with me.
It'll help Project Robinson.

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:30.086
[RAJDHANI gasps]
Perfect, now we're talking.

00:19:30.127 --> 00:19:32.338
[MIZUHO grunting]

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.508
[NAGARA sighs] I might need
this to guide my way...

00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:37.468
...and remind me.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:45.226
[NAGARA gasps, chuckles]

00:19:45.267 --> 00:19:46.852
So old school...

00:19:46.894 --> 00:19:49.021
[RAJDHANI chuckles]
Indeed.

00:19:49.063 --> 00:19:51.774
This is the rocket that first
allowed mankind to make

00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:55.569
the giant leap to the moon.
Should be good luck, eh?

00:19:55.611 --> 00:19:58.239
The cats supplied me
with exact copies.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.450
And, at the top,
it's very "old‐school."

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:03.703
[RAJDHANI]
I was wondering...

00:20:03.744 --> 00:20:06.372
Why do you want to go home?

00:20:06.414 --> 00:20:09.667
Well, because there's
a lot more I wanna do.

00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:13.295
You realize that the cats can't
live in that world anymore.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.966
Yeah, I know.

00:20:18.968 --> 00:20:20.928
[RAJDHANI] Going back
to our world is much easier

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.055
than what we used to believe.

00:20:23.097 --> 00:20:26.767
Don't be fooled, though.
It takes courage and sacrifice.

00:20:26.809 --> 00:20:29.603
And we can't get back
the time we've lost here.

00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:33.232
But still, I know
you guys can make it.

00:20:33.274 --> 00:20:36.819
I hope so, but it's not
just a simple trip home.

00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:39.488
[RAJDHANI]
Hmm. You and Nagara‐

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:41.907
I'm late again, sorry.

00:20:41.949 --> 00:20:44.410
Everything is ready to go.

00:20:44.452 --> 00:20:45.745
Hope you are.

00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:47.788
Tomorrow's the big day.

00:20:50.541 --> 00:20:54.086
No, I won't be joining you.

00:20:54.128 --> 00:20:57.089
I'll be staying right here.

00:20:57.131 --> 00:21:01.552
[RAJDHANI] But if you run into
me out there, please say hello.

00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:03.846
[NAGARA]
Hmm. Yeah, of course.

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:06.557
[MIZUHO]
Here.

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:07.850
[RAJDHANI]
Leave it to me.

00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:11.729
[MIZUHO]
Thanks for everything...

00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:14.231
[YAMABIKO panting]

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:17.359
Yamabiko... be good.

00:21:17.401 --> 00:21:20.279
[MIZUHO whimpers]

00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:23.199
Sakura! Goodbye!

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.201
It's time for me to go...

00:21:29.705 --> 00:21:31.081
[MIZUHO]
Wow.

00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:32.875
I really left them.

00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:38.798
They're smart cats. You know
they understand your reasons.

00:21:40.883 --> 00:21:44.178
Sakura... she'll watch
over them, won't she?

00:21:45.179 --> 00:21:46.597
[NAGARA]
Mm‐hmm.

00:21:49.266 --> 00:21:50.893
[RAJDHANI]
T‐minus 15 seconds.

00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:53.229
Guidance is internal.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:58.651
12, 11, 10, 9...

00:21:58.692 --> 00:22:00.653
Ignition sequence starts.

00:22:24.885 --> 00:22:28.347
[RAJDHANI] Tower has been safely
cleared and you're looking good.

00:22:29.223 --> 00:22:31.433
That's all the support
I can give you.

00:22:31.475 --> 00:22:34.061
Best of luck.

00:22:34.103 --> 00:22:35.396
Copy that.

00:22:35.437 --> 00:22:37.648
So long... my friend.

00:22:44.113 --> 00:22:46.574
[RAJDHANI]
Hmm... Now then.

00:22:47.908 --> 00:22:50.661
[RAJDHANI]
Hmm? From Mizuho.

00:22:50.703 --> 00:22:52.162
How nice.

00:22:52.204 --> 00:22:54.874
Then, this must be...

00:22:54.915 --> 00:22:56.333
[gasps]

00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:58.252
[chuckles]

00:22:58.294 --> 00:23:01.130
Life in this world
may be meaningless...

00:23:01.171 --> 00:23:04.300
...but still, cool things
happen every now and then.

00:23:05.426 --> 00:23:07.928
These moments are
what keep me going.

00:23:10.097 --> 00:23:12.349
[SAKURA]
Mrowr...

00:23:15.603 --> 00:23:20.649
â™ª
