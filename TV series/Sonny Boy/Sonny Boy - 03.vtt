[ASAKAZE sighs]
Sure this is the place, man?

00:00:10.636 --> 00:00:13.013
[NAGARA]
Mm‐hmm. I'm pretty sure of it.

00:00:13.055 --> 00:00:14.890
Okay, well, bon voyage!

00:00:14.932 --> 00:00:15.891
[NAGARA]
Wait, I‐‐

00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.643
[water bubbling]

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:21.813
[NAGARA gasps]

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:44.711
[RAJDHANI] So how did it go?
What was That This World like?

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:48.632
Pretty harrowing. We'd be dead
if it weren't for Asakaze.

00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:50.676
[ASAKAZE]
Just doing my job.

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:53.595
Oh, yeah? Well, thanks,
mister cool.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.728
[NOZOMI] And Nagara
found another portal.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.524
What excellent news.
That's 13 he's found this week.

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.109
All by coincidence?

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.529
That's right.
It just kinda happens.

00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:13.991
[RAJDHANI]
Hmm... Coincidences, huh?

00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:19.121
[RAJDHANI] So I put together a
little report on Nozomi's power.

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:21.206
For the past month,
I had her try and observe

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:23.917
this strange light that
her "Compass" points to,

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:26.878
but I haven't figured out
what it is yet.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.506
If we approach it, it always
seems to maintain about

00:01:29.548 --> 00:01:32.050
the same distance,
and we're not able to affect it

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:33.510
in any way.

00:01:33.552 --> 00:01:37.848
My hypothesis is: it exists in
a domain we can't observe.

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:40.892
[ASAKAZE] If that's true,
how are we gonna reach it?

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:44.730
Yeah, I know.
That's the big question.

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:45.856
[ASAKAZE]
Plus, she's the only one

00:01:45.897 --> 00:01:48.317
who can see the light, right?

00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:50.944
Are we absolutely
sure it exists?

00:01:50.986 --> 00:01:55.157
[NOZOMI] Oh, it does. And I
have zero doubts about that.

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:59.161
Okay, is it a way out?

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:02.122
Startin' to rain.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:05.083
[RAJDHANI]
There may be other powers

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.127
that we don't even
know about yet.

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:09.630
Understanding the
This World we're in now,

00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:12.090
its connection to the school,
and investigating the light

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:13.925
may lead us home.

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.428
[ASAKAZE]
Yeah, maybe so.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.015
But still, what is this world,
anyway, huh?

00:02:20.057 --> 00:02:23.477
And these powers...
Who gave 'em to us?

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:31.026
[MACHI] Murayama's been
missing, but we found him

00:02:31.068 --> 00:02:33.570
in the jungle yesterday.

00:02:33.612 --> 00:02:36.031
Though, he's in
a strange condition.

00:02:36.073 --> 00:02:38.283
Here's a picture of him.

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:39.284
[STUDENT 03A]
Crazy...

00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:40.327
‐‐[STUDENT 03A] Is he a zombie?
‐‐[STUDENT 03B] Man...

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:43.121
[MACHI] Does anybody have any
insight on how this happened?

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:45.957
Like, is this another
weird rule of the island?

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.126
Or did someone else's
power do this to him?

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.796
Anyone see anything?

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.005
Yeah.

00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:55.133
This may be a totally unrelated
thing, but that guy Inuyama

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.636
also disappeared
about a week ago.

00:02:57.678 --> 00:03:00.764
A week ago? How come
you didn't say anything then?

00:03:00.806 --> 00:03:04.434
[OKUJIRI] Uh, well, kinda
thought someone else would.

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:07.729
Turns out, nobody really
seemed to notice he was gone.

00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:09.189
‐‐[thunk]
‐‐[gasping]

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:13.860
[MACHI clears throat]
We need to find out if

00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:16.238
there has been some kind
of accident and investigate

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:18.323
this "freezing" phenomenon.

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:20.283
Volunteers?

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:22.536
You are aware that
not everyone has the time

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:25.122
or crazy superpowers,
aren't you?

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:26.873
Yes, of course.

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:30.752
Huh?

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:33.880
You've got plenty of time on
your hands these days, right?

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:35.716
Not a bad idea to
work with the rest of us‐‐

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:37.676
[MIZUHO]
No.

00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:40.095
Well, how about
we take a vote on it?

00:03:40.137 --> 00:03:42.097
That'd be fair.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.017
Yeah, fine. I'm in.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.687
[MACHI]
Oh? Then, by all means.

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:50.355
‐‐[HOSHI] Mm.
‐‐[clapping]

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:54.192
It's a lot for just one person,
so I'm gonna need an assistant.

00:03:57.738 --> 00:04:00.407
[NAGARA]
Why'd you pick me, anyway?

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:02.701
I don't think I'll be
much help with this stuff.

00:04:02.743 --> 00:04:05.537
Cool. Hush, please.

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.290
[sniffing]

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:09.666
[MURAYAMA] All right,
so I was thinking about

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:12.002
streaming again today,
and after some searching around,

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:14.337
I think I've found the
perfect game! Check this out!

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:15.881
[MIZUHO]
Whoa, is this guy for real?!

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:16.923
Why d'ya say that?

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:18.467
He's live‐streaming!

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:20.218
Seriously? Like, how?

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.845
Yeah, I'd like to know, too.

00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:27.934
[beeping]

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:30.061
[MIZUHO] Whatever,
let's find what's‐his‐name.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.818
[MIZUHO gasps]
There he is.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.780
[beeping increases]

00:04:41.323 --> 00:04:43.658
[MIZUHO]
Hey, are you Inuyama?

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.410
Yup, it's him.

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:46.787
[NAGARA]
Same deal as Mura.

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:48.413
He streaming, too?

00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:50.874
No.

00:04:50.916 --> 00:04:53.668
Huh. What is he doing?

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.048
[INUYAMA]
One, two, three, four...

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:59.925
[NAGARA]
He's working out.

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:05.388
[MIZUHO]
Listen...

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.557
I know what these
dudes have in common.

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:08.558
[NAGARA]
Oh, yeah?

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.477
[MIZUHO] From what I can tell,
no one really notices

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:12.187
if they're hanging
around or not.

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.148
That's why nobody said
anything when they split.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.817
But... we still
gotta figure out

00:05:16.858 --> 00:05:18.652
why they're frozen like this.

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:21.947
Seems like a good thing
to start with, don't ya think?

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:23.240
Starting, how?

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:26.910
Basic sleuthing.
We question everyone involved.

00:05:26.952 --> 00:05:29.246
Okay. I guess so

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.875
[MIZUHO]
Look. Just so you understand...

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:34.835
[NAGARA]
Hmm?

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:37.087
...I'm the boss here,
and you're my assistant,

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:40.966
so keep your mouth shut,
ears open, and do what I say.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:41.967
We clear?

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:43.260
Yeah, we're clear.

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:44.553
Great.

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:46.137
[GEN meows]

00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:49.599
Oh, here you go.

00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:51.017
It's lunchtime.

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:54.229
[MIZUHO]
No, don't sweat it.

00:05:55.272 --> 00:05:57.858
Thanks a lot.
If you can give me stuff,

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:00.610
why does everyone else
have to settle up with you?

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:04.406
[MIZUHO gulps] 'Cause here and
now, that's just how it works.

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:07.617
Did rich folks give you free
stuff back in the real world?

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:09.411
[NAGARA]
No, but still...

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:11.621
Then what's your problem, huh?

00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:13.957
[NAGARA] It's just that,
on the app, you have to pay

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:17.210
every little bit you owe,
like, as soon as possible,

00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:19.838
or your stuff gets burned up
by that blue fire.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.549
Which means everyone has
to work all day, everyday.

00:06:22.591 --> 00:06:25.969
Yeah, and so what?!
It was like that before, right?!

00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:28.722
Things cost money,
which is why ya gotta work.

00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:31.224
That's reality and capitalism.

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:32.684
Ya know?

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:37.772
[MUTSU]
Mura?

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:39.566
He seemed fine to me.

00:06:39.608 --> 00:06:42.819
I mean, I never noticed that
anything was up with him before.

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:45.363
He turned pitch‐black
and stopped moving?

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.824
You don't think it's some
kinda weird disease, do you?

00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:49.701
I hope it's not contagious.

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:51.119

‐‐Oh, that guy?

00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:58.168
I had heard he was
trying to be a streamer.

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:00.962
But, apparently,
he had zero subs.

00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:03.089
Does that have anything
to do with this?

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.971

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:13.099
Uh. kinda do.

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:16.394

I didn't notice.

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.521

Hey, wait up.

00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:21.441
You should hang out a while.

00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:23.985
I think it would be pretty cool
to be friends with you.

[MIZUHO]
They aren't mine.

00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:49.427
Actually, they all belong
to my grandmother.

00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:52.889
[MIZUHO] But she ended up
getting dementia,

00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:55.475

00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:58.687
Apparently, nobody wanted to
look after these little guys,

stuff 'em in my bag.

I don't know, but I could
only use it at school.

had super powers then too.

to do with this world?

00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:25.774
[HOSHI]
Yeah, and who would that be?

00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:27.192
Any idea?

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:29.402
[NOZOMI] You knew this
would happen, didn't you?

00:09:29.444 --> 00:09:33.907
The school drifting, and us
being lost wherever we are.

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:36.367
[NARRATOR]
You'll soon be going adrift.

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:40.163
Headed into a world
governed by the absurd.

00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:42.832
Oh? Then tell me all about it.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.878
[HOSHI] Mm‐hmm! There's a voice
that tells me things.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:47.962
Huh?

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:52.050
So I knew beforehand,
like answers on a test.

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:55.470
So, then, whoever
that voice is must be...

00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:57.722
Yeah. I wonder.

00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:07.440
It looks like we're not going
to find anything without Nagara.

00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:09.901
I'm just having
a little bad luck.

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:11.778
I can do it without him.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.322
[RAJDHANI] You've been
saying that for three days.

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:19.327
Hold on, Tora, when exactly
did I order this stuff?

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:22.539
I asked you to bring me
canned tuna, remember?

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:23.998
[TORA growls]

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.000
What's with
the bad attitude, buddy?

00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:28.378
Well, fine, no dinner
for you tonight.

00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:29.420
[TORA hisses]

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:31.506
‐‐[CAP guffaws]
‐‐[MIZUHO] Don't you hiss at me.

00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:32.966
[MACHI]
Stop screwing around!

00:10:33.007 --> 00:10:35.301
Look, this is no time
for games, okay?!

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:36.886
We're actually losing people!

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:38.972
Yes, and I've been
working on it!

00:10:39.013 --> 00:10:41.391
Well then, what have
you turned up so far?

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:47.897
[NAGARA] Hmm. Okay, here's
what we've come up with.

00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:49.732
Since the victims
were all oddballs,

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:53.153
and didn't really have
any friends here to speak of,

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:55.655
it seems pretty likely that
their exclusion from the group

00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:58.032
has something to do with it.

00:10:58.074 --> 00:10:59.909
Someone's picking on them.

00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:02.162
[MACHI] Like, it's
somebody's power, or what?

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:04.038
Any other idea?

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.708
So then, maybe we should
look at the power list?

00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:07.750
[BOTH grunt]

00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:11.462
[CAP] Hoshi asked us to do a
survey and put together a list

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:15.466
of everyone's super powers,
just in case anything happened.

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:17.802
So, whatcha wanna know?

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:20.054
We're trying to find out if
anyone here has a power

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:22.223
that could be related
to this "freezing."

00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:23.766
[HAYATO]
I want this!

00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:31.691
[HAYATO] There's a lot
that we don't know,

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:35.195
but we have a pretty good grasp
of everyone's powers.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.907
[HAYATO] Of course, there
are some powers that have

00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:40.700
some pretty surprising effects,

00:11:40.742 --> 00:11:43.077
and some that are
incredibly complicated.

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:47.373
Wow, so you're an A rank?
What's your power?

00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:48.708
[HAYATO]
Hmm.

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:53.254
[HAYATO] My finger turns
into a light! Cool, huh?!

00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:55.882
[chuckles]

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:58.176
That's it?

00:11:58.218 --> 00:11:59.844
That's an A rank?

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:01.304
[HAYATO]
Whaddaya mean? It's awesome!

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:02.430
Like in that movie!

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:07.685
Ugh. Doesn't seem to be any
powers similar to freezing.

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:10.855
But I don't know how much faith
we should even put in the list.

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:13.983
[HAYATO]
Whoa, look who's here!

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:15.151
'Sup?

00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:17.403
Heard you haven't
cracked the case yet.

00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:19.447
And Pony kinda blew up at you.

00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:22.283
Yeah, it's taking a little time.

00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:23.660
[ASAKAZE]
Whatever the deal is,

00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:25.745
you don't have to go
back there with us.

00:12:25.787 --> 00:12:26.788
Huh?

00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:30.291
'Cuz we can handle
things without you.

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:31.834
And Nozomi's fine.

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:35.213
She told me earlier that she
didn't really need your help.

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:37.382
Oh, good to know.

00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:41.302
What? You mad?
All you gotta do is ask me, man.

00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:44.097
Even though you slow me down,
I can stick up for you‐‐

00:12:44.138 --> 00:12:45.765
[NAGARA]
No, it's fine.

00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:48.309
Okay then, that settles it.

00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:50.311
Sorry to interrupt you.

00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:53.231
No, it's all my fault.
I bailed on you guys.

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:54.482
So, thanks for‐‐

00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:57.318
[gasps]
So awesome!

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:03.366
[phones beeping]

00:13:13.418 --> 00:13:14.544
[NAGARA]
That's Kaga, right?

00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:15.920
[phones beeping]

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:20.758
[beeping]

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.927
Hey, what was
all that about earlier?

00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:25.430
What was he trying
to talk you out of?

00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:27.223
[NAGARA]
None of your business.

00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:30.476
It was so annoying
watching you with that guy.

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:31.853
Why would you thank him?

00:13:31.894 --> 00:13:34.564
You didn't even believe
a word you told him.

00:13:34.605 --> 00:13:35.898
[NAGARA]
I'm not worried.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:36.941
[MIZUHO]
Liar.

00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:40.028
You really think Asakaze
is a total scumbag, don't you?

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:42.530
Like, you'd much rather
punch him in the nose.

00:13:42.572 --> 00:13:44.240
[NAGARA]
Just shut up, will ya?

00:13:44.282 --> 00:13:46.159
I said, it's fine. I don't care.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.243
So lame.

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:49.287
You just don't have
the guts to fight him.

00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:53.291
[NAGARA] I know that
I couldn't beat him, so.

00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:57.211
[MIZUHO] Does "beating him"
really matter?

00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:06.763
[BOTH gasp]

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:15.355
[MIZUHO gasps]

00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:16.898
[NAGARA gasps]

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.663
[BOTH grunt]

00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:42.590
Um, hey.

00:14:42.632 --> 00:14:46.302
[KAGA gasps] Hold on,
what are you guys doing in here?

00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:48.596
Well. I'm Nagara,
from Class 3.

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:51.015
You got a minute?

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:55.770
Listen, everyone's worried
and looking for you, you okay?

00:14:55.853 --> 00:14:56.854
[KAGA sighs]

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:58.981
You think you'd wanna
come back with us?

00:14:59.023 --> 00:15:01.150
[KAGA]
You don't have to lie, man.

00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:03.361
Nobody's worried about me.

00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:06.781
It's true. No one
really gives a crap.

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:08.616
Must be nice to be gifted.

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:10.451
You guys really
have it all, don't you?

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:12.620
You can easily push
guys like me around.

00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:15.206
So Kaga, how'd you end up here?

00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:16.666
I don't know.

00:15:16.707 --> 00:15:18.793
I just kept thinking I'd had
enough of everything,

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:21.170
and suddenly, here I was.

00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:23.673
[NAGARA]
It just kinda happened?

00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:27.468
[KAGA] I think God finally
heard me and granted my wish.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:28.469
[NAGARA]
Huh.

00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:30.513
Hey, how the hell
did you get in here?

00:15:30.555 --> 00:15:33.182
[NAGARA] Well, these blackout
curtains are connected.

00:15:33.224 --> 00:15:34.183
[MURAYAMA]
What are you talking about?

00:15:34.225 --> 00:15:36.227
Is this not the only room?

00:15:38.479 --> 00:15:40.982
Nobody's watching
your stream, are they?

00:15:41.023 --> 00:15:42.108
[MURAYAMA groans]

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.735
In here playing
your game all by yourself.

00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:46.279
[sighs]

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.531
[MIZUHO groans]

00:15:48.573 --> 00:15:50.450
When I'm in here, I can do
whatever I wanna do

00:15:50.491 --> 00:15:52.743
with my free time.

00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:54.704
You can be a real outcast,
and no one's here

00:15:54.745 --> 00:15:56.289
to make fun of you.

00:15:58.749 --> 00:16:00.626
[AYA]
I don't wanna have to work.

00:16:00.668 --> 00:16:02.795
It's nice in here.

00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:14.223
I get it, the freeze is
another rule in this world.

00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:15.975
Feel kinda silly
for getting worried‐‐

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:18.102
all these kids are
just nerdy loners.

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:19.353
‐‐Don't call them that.
‐‐[phone beeps]

00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:20.938
[MIZUHO]
Hmm?

00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:25.151
Ugh.

00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:27.278
[MACHI] You think you guys
can get them outta there?

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.822
And if you can somehow, will
those creepy statues of them

00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:31.699
go back to normal?

00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:34.827
Prob'ly. But they're not just
gonna come out on their own.

00:16:34.869 --> 00:16:38.372
So what are we gonna do?!
You have a strategy in mind?

00:16:38.414 --> 00:16:40.208
Not just yet, no.

00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:42.752
Well, how about we ask Asakaze
to go and yank them out

00:16:42.793 --> 00:16:44.962
by force? That would
do the trick.

00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:47.632
All of them told us that
they don't want to come out.

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:49.509
We can lure them out with stuff.

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.052
Won't fix the issue.

00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:52.929
[MIZUHO sighs] I can't
believe I actually thought

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.389
you would be helpful,
was I wrong, or what?

00:16:55.431 --> 00:16:56.807
[NAGARA]
What do you mean? I'm just‐‐

00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:58.559
[MIZUHO] This is the
exact reason why Nozomi

00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:01.103
is giving up on you!

00:17:01.145 --> 00:17:02.313
Why'd you say that?

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:04.565
I don't know if she likes you,
but she's been following

00:17:04.607 --> 00:17:06.275
you around like a puppy.

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:07.818
Kinda gross if you ask me.

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:09.445
Hey, that's not how it is!

00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:10.655
There's my point!

00:17:10.696 --> 00:17:13.449
Why do you care? It's none
of your business, anyway!

00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:16.702
You gotta do better! That
attitude won't help anybody!

00:17:16.744 --> 00:17:18.538
There're things you
don't know until you decide

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:20.164
to deal with them!

00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:22.250
[NAGARA sighs]

00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:24.877
Ah, now I see.
It finally clicked.

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:25.920
[MIZUHO]
Hmm?

00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:28.923
It makes sense why you'd offered
to conduct this investigation.

00:17:28.965 --> 00:17:31.008
You wanted to see
how powerless you are.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.009
Huh?

00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:33.970
[NAGARA] You're a nerdy
loner, too, right?

00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:37.139
So you lied about using your
power before this all started,

00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:38.808
as some kind of flex.

00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:40.476
[MIZUHO growls]

00:17:40.518 --> 00:17:42.520
And you're still
just like that, huh?

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:45.690
It's why you still
charge for your stuff.

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:47.066
Huh...?

00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:52.363
[MIZUHO]
Rot in Hell.

00:17:58.661 --> 00:18:00.538
[CAP gasps]

00:18:03.457 --> 00:18:04.875
[RAJDHANI]
Seems the investigation

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:06.544
isn't going so well.

00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:13.843
[NOZOMI] You're looking
kinda down in the dumps.

00:18:13.884 --> 00:18:15.219
[NAGARA sighs]

00:18:17.805 --> 00:18:19.390
I hope you know that
we wouldn't've made

00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:21.559
any of this
progress without you.

00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:22.560
Yeah?

00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:25.313
Yeah, of course.
Asakaze's all talk.

00:18:25.354 --> 00:18:28.524
He can't find
anything on his own.

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:29.900
Seriously?

00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:33.321
So, how are you?
Make any progress on the case?

00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:35.615
We found all of
the frozen people.

00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:37.992
But, like, they totally
hate life here,

00:18:38.034 --> 00:18:39.827
and are hiding from everything.

00:18:39.869 --> 00:18:42.163
‐‐[NOZOMI] Huh?
‐‐But where were they hiding?

00:18:42.204 --> 00:18:43.331
Hard to say.

00:18:43.372 --> 00:18:47.168
In this weird kind of zone with
these huge blackout curtains.

00:18:49.545 --> 00:18:52.006
They keep going on
for as far as I could see.

00:18:52.048 --> 00:18:53.507
But there are a bunch
of gaps in them,

00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:57.178
kind of like pockets, or rooms.
That's where they are.

00:18:57.219 --> 00:19:00.640
Wait, are you saying that you
found portals to other worlds

00:19:00.681 --> 00:19:02.642
outside of the school?

00:19:02.683 --> 00:19:04.894
I'm not entirely sure
what they are.

00:19:04.935 --> 00:19:08.022
The thing that we found
in the AV lab, remember?

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:10.024
Like that?

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:11.651
[NAGARA]
Mm...

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:21.452
Another portal?

00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:23.704
[NAGARA]
Hmm.

00:19:23.746 --> 00:19:25.831
[MIZUHO]
Freakin' idiot!

00:19:25.873 --> 00:19:27.708
Why is he so aggravating?!

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.126
[snarls]

00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:31.712
It's so frustrating!

00:19:31.754 --> 00:19:34.965
[TORA, GEN purring]

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:39.220
Meh. Honestly, I probably
went a little overboard.

00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:41.055
‐‐[phone beeps]
‐‐[MIZUHO] Hmm?

00:19:55.403 --> 00:19:57.571
[MIZUHO]
He's chomping at the bit, huh?

00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:18.300
[NAGARA]
As strange as it seems,

00:20:18.342 --> 00:20:21.345
this is just the way
that this world works.

00:20:23.389 --> 00:20:26.225
[NAGARA] Those who are excluded,
are removed.

00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:29.061
It's one of the rules here.

00:20:29.103 --> 00:20:31.564
They didn't just
"become reclusive."

00:20:31.605 --> 00:20:33.899
It's something
totally different.

00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:59.675
It's always tough‐‐talking
about what's in your heart.

00:21:21.864 --> 00:21:24.283
[MURAYAMA]
Huh? Hmm.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.252
[MIZUHO] I'd say this case
has been fully resolved.

00:21:40.257 --> 00:21:44.595
Look, about what I said...
I was just being snarky.

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:47.389
‐‐I didn't mean it‐‐
‐‐We both were, okay?

00:21:48.808 --> 00:21:50.601
We're good, don't worry.

00:22:11.413 --> 00:22:13.624
The portal's
disappeared. It's gone.

00:22:14.875 --> 00:22:18.128
[RAJDHANI] Hmm. It's not over
at the school anymore either.

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:21.632
So it seems it was that world
causing people to freeze.

00:22:21.674 --> 00:22:22.925
[NOZOMI]
Guess so.

00:22:24.218 --> 00:22:26.262
How'd they even find
a portal out here?

00:22:26.303 --> 00:22:28.806
Not sure I understand that part.

00:22:28.848 --> 00:22:31.183
I kinda have an idea.

00:22:31.225 --> 00:22:34.770
I'm thinking maybe Nagara
does have a power.

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:42.194
[NOZOMI] Like, his power is the
ability to leap into new worlds.

00:22:43.487 --> 00:22:44.947
[RAJDHANI gasps]

00:22:44.989 --> 00:22:48.075
These portals‐‐are just
a product of that.

00:22:49.952 --> 00:22:52.621
Huh, this a
super‐power holdover?

00:23:08.721 --> 00:23:10.764
[HOSHI]
A savior?

00:23:10.806 --> 00:23:12.808
Who in the world could that be?
