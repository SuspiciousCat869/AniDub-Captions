WEBVTT

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.859
[KAGA] So man. Go anywhere
cool for summer break?

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:10.279
I worked and that was about it.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.616
Hey, not bad. You must have
a ton of money now though.

00:01:14.658 --> 00:01:15.951
[NAGARA]
Hmm.

00:01:15.993 --> 00:01:18.287
We took a family trip to Hawaii.

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:26.420
That's kinda crazy,
looks like Hateno.

00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:28.880
Um, I dunno what
you're talking about.

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:30.924
But the water was,
like, super clear.

00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:33.802
You could see loads of fish
and stuff when you went under.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.635
[gasps]

00:02:59.805 --> 00:03:01.973
Hey, Mizuho.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.893
Uh... You are...?

00:03:04.935 --> 00:03:06.978
Uh...

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.940
Sorry, thought you
were someone else.

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:34.798
[growls] Stop daydreaming
and watch where you're going!

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.300
[NAGARA]
Sorry 'bout that.

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:38.844
Idiot.

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:51.982
Was it all a dream?
Did any of it really happen?

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:16.423
[inaudible]

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:30.145
[inaudible]

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:26.660
[gasps]

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:28.537
[gasps]

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:35.961
[NOZOMI] I've been waiting
forever, what took you so long?

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:38.463
Sorry, the guys in
the basketball club needed me

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:39.756
to sub in again.

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:41.883
Guess there's not enough
of me to go around.

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:25.927
[NAGARA]
No.

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:27.888
I'm positive it happened.

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:34.728
[NAGARA]
We were gone all that time...

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:00.962
[clang]

00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:05.550
That sounded scary,
was it supposed to happen?

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.052
[NAGARA]
Yeah, don't worry.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:10.138
We just passed light speed.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.433
Means we're at the doorway
to other dimensions.

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:15.602
[MIZUHO sighs]

00:07:15.644 --> 00:07:17.729
[NAGARA]
Let's get ready.

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:20.190
[MIZUHO groans]

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:33.388
[BOTH gasp]

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.265
[ASAKAZE] Are you sure you know
what you're doing here?

00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:38.435
This is gonna have
serious consequences!

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:42.397
Our original selves,
they're different people now!

00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:45.483
Yeah, we still don't
belong here, though.

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:48.319
You guys are both
freakin' insane.

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:51.197
Just like her...

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:53.700
If you'd never known,
you'd think this was enough.

00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:56.202
We were given more
than our fair share!

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:58.872
Besides, you have to realize
nothing's gonna change here

00:08:58.913 --> 00:09:01.666
or back in our old world!

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:04.252
But we still wanna
see for ourselves.

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:07.297
Nozomi followed her heart
in everything that she did.

00:09:07.338 --> 00:09:10.675
She wasn't forced to do
anything she didn't want to.

00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:30.737
I'm the only one left.

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:32.781
Ms. Aki's gone.

00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:35.325
Kossetsu went and joined Hoshi.

00:09:35.366 --> 00:09:38.620
And Raj became a forest,
living with the animals.

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:40.413
[MIZUHO sighs]

00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:42.874
[ASAKAZE]
Even Hateno Island sunk.

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:45.001
At this point...

00:09:45.043 --> 00:09:47.337
...there's nothing here for me.

00:09:58.056 --> 00:09:59.474
[ASAKAZE]
Go on.

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:02.435
Thanks.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.773
[MIZUHO]
See ya.

00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:18.910
[NAGARA, MIZUHO panting]

00:10:36.678 --> 00:10:39.013
[PRINCIPAL]
You must not leave this place.

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:40.390
[MIZUHO gasps]

00:10:40.431 --> 00:10:43.059
[NAGARA] But you didn't say
we can't leave here.

00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:47.313
I know we'll be okay.

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:48.815
Let's go.

00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:50.233
[MIZUHO]
Mm.

00:11:08.877 --> 00:11:13.006
[BOTH panting]

00:11:13.047 --> 00:11:15.675
[PRINCIPAL] Is it even possible
to take it with you?

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.652
[NAGARA panting]

00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:20.782
[MIZUHO panting]

00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:24.160
[MIZUHO] We're not sure
if Nozomi will be alive

00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:26.913
when we get back home, right?

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:29.290
[NAGARA] That's why
we've got her Compass.

00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:30.583
[MIZUHO]
Hmm?

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:31.668
[NAGARA]
I mean...

00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:33.503
We can't really change anything.

00:12:33.544 --> 00:12:36.547
But only the things
that can happen do happen.

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:41.427
All we're doing is
re‐rolling the dice.

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:57.235
[MIZUHO] Hey, Nagara,
why'd you decide to go back?

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:08.288
Because... I finally see
the same light she did.

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:13.853
[MIZUHO'S MOTHER]
It seems they're building

00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:15.480
apartments here.

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:17.190
[MIZUHO]
Hmm...

00:14:20.485 --> 00:14:23.404
[MIZUHO] Wonder how Grandma's
cats are doing.

00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:26.366
I'd heard that Tora
passed away.

00:14:26.407 --> 00:14:29.410
Oh, really?

00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:32.246
[MIZUHO'S MOTHER]
Well, he was 13 years old.

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:34.749
He lived plenty long.

00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:37.168
The service that took
them in is pricey, though‐‐

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.379
400,000 yen per cat!

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.756
So I'd expect them to get
the best care money can buy.

00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:44.050
I mean, what, do they have
gold litter boxes or what?

00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:46.719
It's weird, everything is gone.

00:15:02.819 --> 00:15:04.320
[gasps]

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.783
Hey, Mizuho.

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:12.495
Uh... You are...?

00:15:12.537 --> 00:15:17.417
[sighs] Sorry, thought
you were someone else.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:22.648
[MIZUHO gasps]

00:16:25.234 --> 00:16:26.611
[MIZUHO grunts]

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:44.170
[NAGARA grunts]

00:16:47.131 --> 00:16:48.591
[MIZUHO]
Hey, Nagara.

00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:54.263
"Rajdhani's parrot laughs, too."

00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:55.932
[gasps]

00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:03.356
[NAGARA]
You remember...

00:17:03.397 --> 00:17:05.274
[MIZUHO]
Mm.

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:06.817
[NAGARA]
Hmm.

00:17:11.322 --> 00:17:12.823
[MIZUHO]
Is work hard?

00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:16.035
[NAGARA]
Meh, it's fine.

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:17.995
[MIZUHO]
I should probably get a job.

00:17:18.037 --> 00:17:21.457
Rent an apartment.
Take in the cats.

00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:23.918
[NAGARA] Don't do it
unless you really have to.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.795
I'm sure there's plenty
of stuff that you need

00:17:25.836 --> 00:17:27.880
to be doing right now.

00:17:27.922 --> 00:17:29.131
[MIZUHO]
Mm.

00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:33.052
[NAGARA]
I knew nothing would change.

00:17:33.094 --> 00:17:36.013
I'd almost convinced
myself to accept that.

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:41.644
[MIZUHO] You chose to go back
to this life, didn't you?

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:47.275
[MIZUHO]
Remember what you told me?

00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:49.860
You said we couldn't
change the world‐‐

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:53.239
the only thing we could do
was roll the dice

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:55.616
and see what happens.

00:17:55.658 --> 00:17:57.702
Do you still believe that?

00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:01.581
Yeah.

00:18:01.622 --> 00:18:04.584
We really can't
change the world.

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:08.546
And we can't reverse time,
either, and make another choice.

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.888
[NAGARA]
When I look back on everything.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:21.267
I felt like there were
almost infinite probabilities,

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:25.771
things were wide open. But now,
I can't see any of them clearly.

00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:29.775
Someday, this moment
in time will be hazy, too.

00:18:29.817 --> 00:18:32.069
I'll just make
the same mistakes again.

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:35.281
Nozomi...

00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:38.242
I'm not sure if she's
the same girl that we knew.

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:41.871
But still, this is
the future that she saw.

00:18:41.912 --> 00:18:43.998
Have you talked to her?

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.959
No. I've only seen her.

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:49.670
Well, she's not gonna remember
what happened to us.

00:18:49.712 --> 00:18:51.047
No.

00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:53.215
Wonder if she's even the same.

00:18:55.384 --> 00:18:56.886
I dunno.

00:18:58.346 --> 00:19:00.473
[MIZUHO]
Guess you gotta work, huh?

00:19:00.514 --> 00:19:02.141
Be seein' you.

00:19:13.861 --> 00:19:15.655
[MIZUHO]
Look, you'll be okay!

00:19:17.114 --> 00:19:18.991
If you're like
what you were back there,

00:19:19.033 --> 00:19:23.329
you're gonna be just fine,
I promise. So don't worry.

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:28.459
[NAGARA]
Mm.

00:19:55.695 --> 00:20:01.367
[inaudible]

00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:15.733
You were worried
about them, too?

00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:17.359
[gasps]

00:21:17.401 --> 00:21:19.570
[NOZOMI]
I heard some crazy chirping.

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:21.739
One of the guys at the station
told me he thought the mother

00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:24.533
had been killed by
a crow or something.

00:21:24.575 --> 00:21:27.119
Almost all of the poor
little birdies were dead,

00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:28.454
but this one's still alive.

00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:31.123
[squeaks]

00:21:31.165 --> 00:21:33.250
Can you take care of it?

00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:35.753
[NAGARA]
Uh. No...

00:21:35.795 --> 00:21:38.130
I'm not allowed to have pets...

00:21:39.256 --> 00:21:43.177
[NOZOMI] Uh. We used to go
to the same school, right?

00:21:45.596 --> 00:21:48.015
Yeah. You transferred
in during the second term

00:21:48.057 --> 00:21:49.892
of third year, didn't you?

00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:51.227
[ASAKAZE]
Nozomi.

00:21:51.268 --> 00:21:53.354
[NOZOMI] Well, it looks like
mama bird didn't come back

00:21:53.395 --> 00:21:55.481
to the nest.

00:21:55.523 --> 00:21:57.650
And this one is
the only survivor.

00:21:57.691 --> 00:22:00.110
Huh. So what are you gonna do?

00:22:00.152 --> 00:22:02.780
[NOZOMI] Hmm. I'm gonna look
after it, of course!

00:22:02.822 --> 00:22:04.448
Least till it can fly.

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:05.658
Ah.

00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:07.660
[laughs]

00:22:26.136 --> 00:22:28.514
[NAGARA] Our lives are
just getting started.

00:22:28.556 --> 00:22:31.600
The road ahead is full
of twists and turns.
