WEBVTT

00:00:09.218 --> 00:00:11.553
[PRINCIPAL] Back on that day
during summer vacation,

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:14.723
you knew the school
would start drifting.

00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:17.059
I must ask why you still came.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.103
[HOSHI] Sure, I mean,
I did know what was going on.

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:21.772
And that's exactly why I came.

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:24.107
I couldn't just let it
happen to everyone else.

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:27.319
[PRINCIPAL] But what was
the point of you being there?

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:28.654
Well, I...

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.698
The other students didn't ask
for you to save them, did they?

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:35.244
[NAGARA]
Is this a movie theater world?

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:37.746
[RAJDHANI] It's not your
ordinary, everyday cinema,

00:00:37.788 --> 00:00:39.248
that's for sure.

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.750
You see that?

00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:43.752
It's your point of view.

00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:47.381
[NAGARA]
Mm...

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:52.511
[RAJDHANI] Hmm...
Skimming through the reel,

00:00:52.553 --> 00:00:55.430
it seems like the whole film
is shot from your perspective.

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:56.473
[NAGARA]
What?!

00:00:56.515 --> 00:00:58.809
But... I didn't film it!

00:00:59.935 --> 00:01:02.104
[laughs]
I didn't think you did!

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:03.397
[NAGARA sighs]

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:05.148
Then who could it have been?

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.986
Yeah. I'm not exactly sure
what's going on here.

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:11.029
But this may be
the first "This World"

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.323
capable of manifesting
another one.

00:01:13.365 --> 00:01:16.660
I feel like this is some
sort of special place.

00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:19.246
[AKI] You still haven't
found Nagara yet?!

00:01:19.288 --> 00:01:21.123
It's been two months already!

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:23.166
What the hell
have you been doing?!

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:25.127
Sir, yes, sir!

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:27.337
He seems to be wandering
from world to world,

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:29.006
and none of the
super‐power holdovers,

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:30.757
have been able
to detect him, sir!

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.676
[AKI] There's no way
that simple boy thought of

00:01:32.718 --> 00:01:34.344
that strategy on his own,

00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:36.805
which means he must have
others working for him!

00:01:36.847 --> 00:01:40.142
They're just as guilty as he is!
Find them, at any cost!

00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:42.019
[STUDENTS]
Sir, yes, sir!

00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:45.856
[rustling]

00:01:45.897 --> 00:01:46.857
[MIZUHO]
Hmm?

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:48.650
[crunching]

00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:50.319
Uh...

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.071
‐‐[RAJDHANI] Hmm...
‐‐[stomach growls]

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:56.158
What's taking her so long?
I'm starving here.

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:59.745
[RAJDHANI] Relax‐‐she'll
be back before too long.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:01.455
I've got some chocolate
if you want.

00:02:01.496 --> 00:02:02.831
Thanks.

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:06.835
[NAGARA]
Hmm? Ah!

00:02:06.877 --> 00:02:08.503
Whoa! A dog?!

00:02:09.755 --> 00:02:12.132
[DOG]
Hmm... You smell nice.

00:02:12.174 --> 00:02:15.510
I love the sweet
scent of chocolate.

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:17.387
Wait, did you hear
that just now?!

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:19.097
This dog can talk!

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:22.100
‐‐[MIZUHO] Shake hands!
‐‐[DOG] Mm...

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:23.101
‐‐Sit!
‐‐[DOG whines]

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:24.478
‐‐Sit up!
‐‐[DOG whines]

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.814
I'd like you to meet my friend.
This is Yamabiko.

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:29.775
[BOTH gasp]

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.693
[MIZUHO] Sounds like he had
a similar experience to ours,

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:34.655
and drifted into this world.

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:37.074
[MIZUHO chuckles]

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:39.576
[MIZUHO] And apparently,
he used to be human,

00:02:39.618 --> 00:02:42.329
but just kinda ended up
like this somehow.

00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:44.289
[MIZUHO]
Who's a good boy?

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.670
Nice to meet you.

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:52.839
So he's a veteran
castaway... dog?

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:53.840
[NAGARA]
Mm...

00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:55.634
[sniffs]
Yuck.

00:02:55.676 --> 00:02:58.512
[RAJDHANI] Okay, so if you're
a castaway, like we are,

00:02:58.553 --> 00:03:02.140
does that mean you're in some
sort of stasis, as well?

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.309
‐‐[YAMABIKO] Yep.
‐‐I'm afraid I don't understand

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:06.853
why you're a dog.
Is it like a power?

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:09.690
[YAMABIKO] Hmph. I may be
a dog now, but my true nature

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:13.193
hasn't really changed.
I'm who I've always been.

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:17.739
So where do you live?
Somewhere nearby?

00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:19.533
[YAMABIKO] I was living
in the forest, but I left

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:21.910
after that big
storm blew through.

00:03:21.952 --> 00:03:23.412
[MIZUHO]
He mean Asakaze?

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:26.164
Ah... Most likely.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:30.252
[NAGARA] Do you happen to
know... why we've been drifting?

00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:32.838
[YAMABIKO]
Afraid not.

00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:37.592
[MIZUHO]
Can we ever go home again?

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:40.470
[YAMABIKO] I will say there've
been lots of people before me

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:43.890
who tried to go back, but
no one was able to pull it off.

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:44.891
[gasps]

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:47.185
[YAMABIKO] Though that doesn't
mean it's impossible.

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.186
What?!

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:49.604
We can go home?

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:51.690
[YAMABIKO]
Yeah.

00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:53.275
There's time.

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:54.818
[gasps]

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.070
[YAMABIKO] You folks have
been here for less than a year,

00:03:57.112 --> 00:03:58.613
if I'm not mistaken.

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:05.620
[CAP sighs]
We're so close to being done!

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:07.831
[HOSHI] Mm‐hmm. We just have
to collect the material

00:04:07.873 --> 00:04:10.792
that will serve as it its core.

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:12.586
[MACHI] You're sure...
that we don't need to go

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:14.171
and look for it?

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:17.174
We don't.
Supposedly, it'll come to us.

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:19.426
‐‐[door clicks]
‐‐[GROUP gasps]

00:04:19.468 --> 00:04:20.719
[NOZOMI]
Hey.

00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:22.929
How's it goin'?

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:25.056
[HOSHI] It's been quite
a while, hasn't it?

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:26.433
What have you been up to?

00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:28.226
[NOZOMI] We've been hopping
around to different worlds

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.729
with Nagara, looking for
the piece we need

00:04:30.771 --> 00:04:32.481
to get us back home.

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:35.108
So... why don't we
go home together?

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.027
[HOSHI]
Hmph. You know why.

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:39.362
We've already given
you our answer.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.699
The outcome has
already been decided.

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:44.910
We can't go home.

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:47.913
Which means
we have to stay here.

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:50.165
Now, I really don't wanna
hear any more of that

00:04:50.207 --> 00:04:52.292
"there's nothing we
can do" bs, okay?

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:54.461
Young people like us are
supposed to keep on trying,

00:04:54.503 --> 00:04:56.755
no matter what, right?

00:04:56.797 --> 00:05:00.050
And plus, right now,
we're inside the light.

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:01.802
One step away.

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:06.014
Surprised someone's
drifted longer than us.

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:08.517
He said that there
was still time.

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:10.227
That we're all still connected.

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:11.770
[RAJDHANI]
Yeah, he sure did.

00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:14.689
Maybe whatever holds
the connection in place...

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:18.151
Maybe it could be somewhere
here in this world?

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:20.070
Yeah. Maybe.

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:22.656
Assuming that using your
power is the act that created

00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:25.325
this world, and that your
power originated back

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:28.578
in our own world, then it's
possible using your power

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.374
at the school might have created
a This World onto itself.

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:35.335
And if that theory proves true,
then perhaps there's film

00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:37.587
of our own world
in here, as well.

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.549
Since we weren't the only ones
to drift, and that it happened

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.386
again at the very same school,
it's worth investigating.

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:48.890
[YAMABIKO] Seems like you
guys got the wrong impression.

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:51.309
I'm also a third‐year
student and went to

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:55.730
Shiraito Middle School
Number 2 just like you.

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:56.815
The same school?!

00:05:56.857 --> 00:05:57.816
We're classmates?!

00:05:57.858 --> 00:05:59.192
Crazy, what's your name?

00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:00.819
Yamada Kunihiko.

00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:01.862
[gasping]

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:03.989
You remember anyone
by that name?

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.324
[YAMABIKO sighs]
Not surprised you don't know me.

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:08.034
I actually enrolled
there the same year

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:09.911
that you guys graduated.

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:11.788
Wait... so what
you're saying is...

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.290
If I'm following you...

00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:16.418
...that would mean you're
here from the future.

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:18.253
[YAMABIKO]
Space‐time is flexible.

00:06:18.295 --> 00:06:22.799
[gasps] Okay. So how
long have you been here?

00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:24.759
[YAMABIKO]
Five thousand years.

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:26.261
[GROUP gasping]

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:30.181
He's been here 5,000 years...

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:34.227
It doesn't seem real to me,
not to mention he's a dog now.

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:36.605
[RAJDHANI screams]
Wh‐Wh‐What's happening?!

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:38.690
[NAGARA gasps]

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:40.734

‐‐[NAGARA] You okay?

[RAJDHANI]
The heck did you do?!

00:06:45.614 --> 00:06:49.117
This reel has footage of us
on it, and it all seems to be

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:51.286
from after we moved
to the island.

00:06:51.328 --> 00:06:53.330
Go fetch.

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:55.290
Do it!

00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:56.875
I'd like to try something.

00:06:56.917 --> 00:06:57.959
[NAGARA]
Hmm.

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:03.214
[RAJDHANI] I made an app
that processes movies.

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:04.215

Yep, it's true.

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:15.727
Any change to the film has an
actual impact on the real world.

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:19.689
another little experiment.

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:22.943
Okay, got some
images from the film.

00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:27.572
Now, let's splice something in,
like the Monkey Mountain.

[RAJDHANI]
Fascinating, huh?!

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:37.666
By editing two
"This Worlds" together,

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:39.793
we can create a composite!

00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:42.379
So cool. It's incredible.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.673
Take a look at this.

00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:47.801
I had tried this before, but...

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:50.679
It didn't seem to cause
any changes that time.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.390
But now, things are different
since you're watching

00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:55.475
‐‐the preview with me.
‐‐[NAGARA] Huh?

00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:58.228
[RAJDHANI] Meaning, the world
cannot be changed merely

00:07:58.269 --> 00:07:59.479
by making an edit.

00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:03.525
The main factor is whether or
not you're here watching it.

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:09.406
Okay, what if we ran
the film backwards?

00:08:09.447 --> 00:08:10.615
[gasps]

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:16.788
[AKI] The situation has
gotten way more serious.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.832
[ASAKAZE] You sure we should
leave it up to them?

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:21.668
[AKI] You're talking about
those delicate little mice?

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.212
They're as pure as can be,
and haven't gotten any kind

00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:26.214
of preferential treatment.

00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:29.217
They need me watching over them.

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:32.470
The ones to be wary of,
are those who're too confident

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:35.974
with their new powers,
and now dare to defy God.

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:37.642
Their little scheme could
actually bring about

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:40.186
the end of the world.

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:42.522
[ASAKAZE]
Really? That serious?

00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:45.442
[AKI] Oh, yeah. So we're gonna
have to do whatever it takes

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.318
to ruin their plan.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.447
You're the only one who can
truly protect the others.

00:08:50.488 --> 00:08:52.449
You understand that, yeah?

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.826
But there's nothing
for you to worry about.

00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:58.204
Your power and my sense
of relativity were a match

00:08:58.246 --> 00:08:59.914
made in heaven.

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:04.169
[NOZOMI]
Hey, you ever gonna come back?

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.254
I wanna get us
all together again.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.299
Nagara's with you?

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.052
[NOZOMI]
Mm‐hmm. He's still goin' at it.

00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:15.096
Trying to prove to himself that
he can stand up to the world.

00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:16.973
He's really come a long way!

00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:19.350
[ASAKAZE sighs]

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:24.689
[RAJDHANI] Hmm... I guess
playing it backwards must go

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:26.983
against the rules of this world.

00:09:27.025 --> 00:09:30.487
Was kinda hoping we could go
back before we went adrift,

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:32.864
but of course it
wouldn't be that easy.

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:33.865
[NAGARA]
Huh?

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:36.326
[RAJDHANI] We can see the past,
but we can't change it.

00:09:36.367 --> 00:09:38.119
I suppose that means
effects can't happen

00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:39.829
before their causes.

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:42.874
[NAGARA]
What's this...?

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:44.751
Oh, don't think we can use it.

00:09:44.793 --> 00:09:47.837
It's the wrong size
and covered in mildew.

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:49.464
[BOTH gasp]

00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:53.593
[NAGARA]
Hold on...

00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:58.848
[RAJDHANI]
Wow, man...

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.934
You're really something special.

00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:05.396
It's possible for us to go home.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.109
[NOZOMI] So you're starting
on a new project?

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.821
[RAJDHANI] Mm‐hmm.
The "Director's Cut" project.

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:14.322
And that is...?

00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:17.117
Let me explain, sometimes,
a movie that has already

00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:18.910
been released will
be re‐edited,

00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:21.955
it changes the way
that the story is told.

00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:23.581
So I had the idea

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:25.750
of us doing our own
director's cut.

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:27.001
Of what?

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:29.879
Of ourselves... and this world.

00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:31.422
[gasping]

00:10:33.007 --> 00:10:35.677
[RAJDHANI] This has us ending up
in this world by mistake,

00:10:35.718 --> 00:10:37.220
as castaways.

00:10:37.262 --> 00:10:39.806
And this...
has different footage.

00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:42.433
Which, luckily, Nagara found.

00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:46.229
[RAJDHANI] And this film
shows our own world,

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:47.772
the one we're supposed to be in.

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:48.898
[STUDENTS gasping]

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.567
Wow, that takes me back!

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:51.943
You weren't there then.

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:53.111
Oh, you're right.

00:10:53.153 --> 00:10:55.196
[RAJDHANI] We're going to cut
ourselves into here where

00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:58.616
we're missing, and make
a re‐edit of our own world.

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:02.078
Hopefully, this way,
we can change our story.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.039
That sounds pretty ambitious,
who's gonna do it?

00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:06.291
Nagara, right?

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:07.292
[STUDENTS gasping]

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:08.585
[RAJDHANI]
Yep.

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:10.753
It's gonna be
a tough hurdle to clear.

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:12.922
But I know that Nagara
can handle it.

00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:14.799
[gasping]

00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:17.010
[NOZOMI]
We can't change the past.

00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:18.011
That's fine.

00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:20.138
'Cause we can do whatever
we want with the future.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:21.848
[GROUP sighing]

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:26.352
[HOSHI] What if the future's
already been decided?

00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:27.353
[gasping]

00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:29.772
We already know how
it's gonna turn out.

00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:34.194
But what's so great...
about knowing?

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:35.695
[gasping]

00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:38.156
Well, knowledge is power.

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:40.074
Though no matter
powerful you are,

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:41.784
you can't change the future.

00:11:41.826 --> 00:11:44.204
It's much better for someone
to use their power in a way

00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:46.080
that's helpful to everyone.

00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:49.667
This shelter that I created
is more like an ark.

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.502
It's going to be our savior.

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:54.797
I made something to protect us
from what's coming.

00:11:55.757 --> 00:11:57.675
[NAGARA]
Don't just save yourselves.

00:11:57.717 --> 00:12:00.261
[HOSHI]
Hmm? Got something to say?

00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:02.972
It may all be set in stone...

00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:04.349
...but I won't run.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.683
[NOZOMI grunts]

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:08.186
[CAP]
Yeah. Nagara's got a point.

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:09.395
Right? We oughtta‐‐

00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:14.025
Now, Cap, have I been wrong
about anything so far?

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:15.568
[CAP]
Guess not.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.820
But... still...

00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:21.324
[NOZOMI] If I just took
the safe options and did exactly

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:22.867
as I'm told all the time,

00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:26.120
I wouldn't look back
and say, "Good job, me!"

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:28.581
That's not really
much of a life, is it?

00:12:33.378 --> 00:12:36.547
Uh‐oh. Nagara, I think
that might be a sign for us

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.716
to move to another world.

00:12:45.223 --> 00:12:46.933
[KII]
I'm gettin' real sick of this.

00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:49.018
No matter how many
power holdovers we get,

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.437
we won't beat Asakaze and them.

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:54.774
It sucks, but maybe
we were wrong after all.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.655
[HAYATO gasps]

00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:04.367
[TORA meows]

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:06.911
[HOSHI] So, you were really
able to change the world?

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:08.413
[RAJDHANI]
Yeah. It worked pretty well

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:10.832
in our experiments,
for the most part.

00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:12.041
Meaning?

00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:14.711
[RAJDHANI] Mm... Sometimes,
the editing works,

00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:16.170
and sometimes it doesn't.

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:19.632
It seems there's an element
of chance involved.

00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:22.302
[MACHI] Are you sure
we're gonna be okay?

00:13:22.343 --> 00:13:23.761
Things won't get weirder?

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:24.971
[RAJDHANI]
I wouldn't worry.

00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:26.806
The fact remains
that only the things

00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:28.641
that can happen will happen.

00:13:28.683 --> 00:13:31.894
It's not going
to change who you are.

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:33.479
That so?

00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:35.231
[RAJDHANI] I assure you,
you're not suddenly

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:36.941
gonna turn into a dog.

00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:38.609
‐‐[sighs]
‐‐For starters,

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:41.237
this world is set up
so that things work out

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:43.114
in the students' favor.

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:45.408
Why is it just us?

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.536
Only those from our
school going adrift?

00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:52.332
Well, it's because
the principal is God.

00:13:52.373 --> 00:13:54.000
[gasps]

00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:55.460
Our principal?

00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:57.337
That guy's God?

00:13:57.378 --> 00:13:59.297
[YAMABIKO] The drifting
happened because he willed it

00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:01.174
to happen.

00:14:01.215 --> 00:14:04.802
Uh... But how the heck
could the principal be God?

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:07.430
It's just a coincidence,
to be honest with you.

00:14:07.472 --> 00:14:10.350
God just happened
to be the principal.

00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:12.393
[MACHI] What do you mean,
"he just happened to be"?

00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:14.020
And what's the point
of us going adrift

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:16.272
in the first place, anyway?

00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:18.274
[YAMABIKO]
There is no point.

00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:19.942
None.

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:21.694
[phone jingles]

00:14:22.945 --> 00:14:25.615
It's from Ace. He's saying
that he and his group

00:14:25.656 --> 00:14:27.325
wanna meet up
with us here.

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:29.369
Ugh, after all that crap
they put Nagara through,

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:30.995
they wanna have a nice chat?!

00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:33.664
‐‐[HOSHI] Let them come.
‐‐Ah! But why?!

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:35.708
If they've taken the step
of contacting us,

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:38.044
they must be rethinking
their actions.

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:40.630
Or, if they're in trouble,
then we need to help them out.

00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:42.507
[MIZUHO]
I want 'em to beg for it!

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:45.343
This is the entire
purpose of the ark.

00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:52.850
[HOSHI]
Okay, this is the spot.

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:54.811
We're gonna build
our ark right here.

00:14:54.852 --> 00:14:55.895
[CAP]
An ark?

00:14:55.937 --> 00:14:56.938
[HOSHI]
Yeah.

00:14:56.979 --> 00:14:59.190
It's all up to me
to save everybody.

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:00.400
Understand?

00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:01.984
[PRINCIPAL]
It's what I want.

00:15:02.026 --> 00:15:04.904
My wish is to save you all.

00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:07.907
[CAP] You don't think we should
help Rajdhani and those guys?

00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:08.908
[HOSHI]
Why?

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:09.909
[CAP]
"Why"?!

00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:11.744
Because, man,
it's kinda starting to look like

00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:13.371
we'll never make it home.

00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:14.705
[HOSHI]
And what if we don't?

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:15.832
[CAP]
Uh?

00:15:15.873 --> 00:15:17.792
Even if we never make it home,

00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:20.461
it's not really a problem
for our old world.

00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:23.297
[PRINCIPAL]
It's up to you to save them.

00:15:23.339 --> 00:15:27.260
[HOSHI] All I'm trying to do
here is save my fellow students.

00:15:27.301 --> 00:15:30.346
[PRINCIPAL] Have the others
sought salvation from you?

00:15:31.472 --> 00:15:34.642
[MACHI] Are you sure
this is the best way?

00:15:34.684 --> 00:15:37.353
I mean, just doing
exactly as you're told?

00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:40.440
It's just... It's not like you.

00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:45.278
We leave tomorrow.

00:15:45.319 --> 00:15:47.572
We'll be there for graduation.

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:49.115
You think that we could
miss this much school

00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:51.033
and still
graduate, though?

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:53.786
No clue.

00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:07.049
[HOSHI]
You can't fly anymore.

00:16:09.093 --> 00:16:11.262
So... Today's graduation...

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:17.143
I'll be back.

00:16:21.355 --> 00:16:24.484
[HOSHI] And now,
our shelter has become an ark.

00:16:25.693 --> 00:16:28.029
[YAMABIKO sniffing]

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.447
[gasping]

00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:31.991
[AKI] When are you gonna get it
through your thick skulls?!

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:35.244
Just give up, already!

00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:37.330
[screaming]

00:16:46.797 --> 00:16:48.966
[RAJDHANI]
Ms. Aki! Please, listen to me!

00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:51.135
This project will
not end the world!

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:52.845
It's just not possible!

00:16:52.887 --> 00:16:54.889
It is ending, idiot!

00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:56.307
A teacher?

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:58.017
No, there's no way.

00:16:58.059 --> 00:16:59.101
[MIZUHO]
How come?

00:16:59.143 --> 00:17:01.020
[YAMABIKO] The only things
that go adrift are the school

00:17:01.062 --> 00:17:02.188
and its students.

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:03.648
[MACHI gasps]
But...

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:04.982
[CAP gasps]

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:10.154
The only option is for you
all to stay right here!

00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:11.656
Go and stop them.

00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:12.865
[ASAKAZE grunts]

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:19.872
[MIZUHO whimpering]

00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:21.123
[CAP gasps]

00:17:23.334 --> 00:17:24.502
[HOSHI sighs]

00:17:28.965 --> 00:17:30.550
[gasping]

00:17:35.471 --> 00:17:38.391
[STUDENTS gasping]

00:17:41.727 --> 00:17:42.728
[AKI growls]

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.480
Is Nagara doing this?

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:48.192
The world really has changed.

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:50.903
[RAJDHANI] Mm‐hmm. Looks
to me like it worked.

00:17:50.945 --> 00:17:54.532
We should move on
with it. You in?

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:56.701
Yeah, let's go.

00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:58.953
Give it a shot.

00:17:58.995 --> 00:18:01.872
[NOZOMI] They say they're
ready whenever you are.

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:03.499
We're ready here, too.

00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:04.584
Sweet!

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:05.960
Let's all go back home!

00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:08.212
[NAGARA]
Hmm.

00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:21.601
[TEACHER 01A] Honestly...
What are we going to do

00:18:21.642 --> 00:18:23.311
about your mother?

00:18:25.313 --> 00:18:27.857
Can't you just make
a decision on your own?

00:18:27.898 --> 00:18:30.651
'Cause just talking about it
won't be enough.

00:18:30.693 --> 00:18:32.361
Hmm? What is that?

00:18:32.403 --> 00:18:35.072
[NAGARA]
Huh?

00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:36.282
When did that get there?

00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:37.742
[GIRL06B] Teacher?
There's a dead bird

00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:38.784
right at the front gate.

00:18:38.826 --> 00:18:40.828
[GIRL06A]
It's super gross. Do something!

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.204
[TEACHER 01A]
Don't tell me that you...

00:18:42.246 --> 00:18:44.165
[NAGARA]
Huh?

00:18:44.206 --> 00:18:47.543
You can't... take out your
frustrations like that.

00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:51.047
[NAGARA]
Mm? No, it wasn't me.

00:18:59.055 --> 00:19:01.223
[NAGARA]
Uh? Something wrong?

00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:02.558
[NOZOMI]
The light...

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.602
It's right here...

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:05.686
[NAGARA]
The light?

00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:07.396
The one you keep talking about?

00:19:07.438 --> 00:19:11.609
[NOZOMI] Uh‐huh. So I was
right the entire time!

00:19:15.237 --> 00:19:16.530
[NAGARA gasps]

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:26.666
[PRINCIPAL] Your involvement
is no longer necessary.

00:19:26.707 --> 00:19:30.378
[NOZOMI panting]

00:19:37.802 --> 00:19:39.595
Asakaze!

00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:41.889
[giggles]

00:19:43.724 --> 00:19:45.142
[NOZOMI]
Huh...?

00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:51.691
[NOZOMI gasps]

00:19:51.732 --> 00:19:53.192
Hang on...

00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:57.697
[NAGARA gasps]

00:19:57.738 --> 00:20:04.745
[STUDENTS singing]

00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:08.124
That was... me.

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:13.045
[NOZOMI gulps]

00:20:13.087 --> 00:20:18.342
[GIRLS crying]

00:20:18.384 --> 00:20:20.219

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:29.979

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:36.569
[singing continues]

00:20:47.788 --> 00:20:49.206
[PRINCIPAL]
It's a pity, isn't it?

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:50.875
[NAGARA gasps]

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:55.629
You must screen the future to
clearly see what will happen.

00:20:55.671 --> 00:20:57.339
[NAGARA]
What do you mean?

00:20:57.381 --> 00:20:58.966
[PRINCIPAL]
Contrary to your belief,

00:20:59.008 --> 00:21:00.801
you did not create a world.

00:21:00.843 --> 00:21:03.554
After all's said and done,
you're just an observer

00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:07.349
who's opened a box
of possibilities.

00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:11.145
This world exists because
you're here watching it.

00:21:12.271 --> 00:21:13.731
The truth is...

00:21:13.773 --> 00:21:16.317
...all of you are just copies.

00:21:16.358 --> 00:21:18.277
[gasps]
What the hell?

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:21.071
How's there another me here?

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:24.074
Guess this means
we weren't chosen.

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:26.577
And there's no home
to go back to.

00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:27.703
[gasping]

00:21:27.745 --> 00:21:31.123
[RAJDHANI] I see...
So we weren't going adrift.

00:21:31.165 --> 00:21:33.876
It was all just God
rolling the dice.

00:21:42.927 --> 00:21:45.471
[applause]

00:21:45.513 --> 00:21:47.765
[PRINCIPAL] Did you truly
believe that you were

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:50.476
the only special ones?

00:21:50.518 --> 00:21:52.895
[STRANGER]
Looks like they failed, huh?

00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:54.688
They got really close, though.

00:21:57.024 --> 00:21:59.527
[PRINCIPAL]
Kudos on your graduation.

00:22:11.872 --> 00:22:14.083
[ASAKAZE] You're positive
this was for the best?

00:22:14.124 --> 00:22:15.209
[AKI]
I am.

00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:17.503
The world has been saved.

00:22:19.421 --> 00:22:20.381
[NAGARA]
Sorry.

00:22:20.422 --> 00:22:21.966
Thought it would work.

00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:23.551
[RAJDHANI]
It's not your fault, man.

00:22:23.592 --> 00:22:26.011
That what happens
when you roll the dice.

00:22:26.053 --> 00:22:27.346
[HOSHI]
He's right.

00:22:27.388 --> 00:22:30.891
We were taking a chance that
we'd become the originals.

00:22:30.933 --> 00:22:32.935
[HOSHI] I'm sorry for
underestimating you.

00:22:34.395 --> 00:22:37.439
[MIZUHO] Hey. I thought you told
us that we still had some time.

00:22:37.481 --> 00:22:39.066
[YAMABIKO] Eight months
is inside the margin

00:22:39.108 --> 00:22:41.485
of error of a life.

00:22:41.527 --> 00:22:42.820
[MIZUHO]
Hmm?

00:22:42.862 --> 00:22:45.698
[YAMABIKO] Time has definitely
run out for me, though.

00:22:52.329 --> 00:22:54.248
[NAGARA]
We gotta get going.

00:22:57.751 --> 00:22:59.587
[NOZOMI]
I was dead.

00:22:59.628 --> 00:23:00.963
[NAGARA]
Huh?

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:06.051
I wonder what
the light I saw really is?
