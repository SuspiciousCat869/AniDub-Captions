WEBVTT

00:00:09.218 --> 00:00:10.344
[MIZUHO]
Sit.

00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:11.595
Shake hands.

00:00:11.637 --> 00:00:12.596
[YAMABIKO groans]

00:00:12.638 --> 00:00:14.389
Bang!

00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:16.475
You're s'posed to
play dead, ya know?

00:00:16.517 --> 00:00:17.476
See?

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:19.019
On the ground like this.

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:21.939
[YAMABIKO]
Not happening.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.857
[MIZUHO]
I thought you were a dog.

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:25.692
[YAMABIKO]
I was once a human.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:27.653
[MIZUHO]
But you're a dog now, right?

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.196
[NAGARA]
Dinner's ready.

00:00:29.238 --> 00:00:30.614
[YAMABIKO barks]

00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:34.409
[MIZUHO]
Ugh.

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:39.373
[sniffing]

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:41.875
Nuh‐uh! That one is Nozomi's!

00:00:41.917 --> 00:00:43.252
Gen, I thought you knew
better than to bring

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:45.629
the exact same thing as before.

00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:47.297
[YAMABIKO]
I'm confused.

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.800
Why didn't she make
the trek with us, anyway?

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:51.218
[MIZUHO]
Who knows?

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.930
Probably a spat
with a certain someone.

00:00:54.972 --> 00:00:56.473
[NAGARA slurps]

00:01:00.644 --> 00:01:03.063
[MIZUHO] So you have
any stories to tell?

00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:04.982
[YAMABIKO]
I'm a dog, remember?

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:06.608
[MIZUHO]
Be that way.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.695
Well, how 'bout why
you turned into a dog?

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:12.698
[YAMABIKO]
Why did I turn into a dog?

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:14.116
Hmm, that's a great question.

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:16.201
[MIZUHO groans]
You forget?

00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:19.204
[YAMABIKO] It was a long
time ago, so gimme a break.

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:20.664
[MIZUHO]
Okay, it's cool.

00:01:20.706 --> 00:01:23.333
Can you just tell us
what you do remember?

00:01:24.835 --> 00:01:28.005
[YAMABIKO]
Let me think a second...

00:01:28.046 --> 00:01:31.800
Yeah. Like I said,
it was a long time ago.

00:01:31.842 --> 00:01:33.760
About 5,000 years, in fact.

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:40.767
[YAMABIKO]
I was so sullen back then.

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:43.687
Always with a scowl on my face.

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:48.775
[YAMABIKO] But I met someone
who was kind enough to share

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:50.569
her smile with me.

00:01:56.908 --> 00:01:59.953
[YAMABIKO] The power
she had was very special.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.086
[YAMABIKO] With it, she could
control almost anything.

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:10.964
You'll be okay now.

00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:16.428
[YAMABIKO] She brought warmth
and hope to everyone around her.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.015
We trusted her to make decisions
in our best interest.

00:02:20.057 --> 00:02:22.768
She meant the absolute
world to us.

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:27.773
[YAMABIKO] However, this hope
and happiness would not last.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.073
[YAMABIKO] Our group was hit
by an unknown illness.

00:02:36.114 --> 00:02:39.076
Lesions, which became tumors,

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:41.578
and grew larger by the day.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.122
Although her
power seemed limitless,

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:46.333
we found there were things
she couldn't do,

00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:47.918
like healing them.

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:52.172
[KODAMA]
Tell me, Yamabiko.

00:02:52.214 --> 00:02:54.091
How do I look today?

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:57.511
[KODAMA]
I want your honest opinion.

00:02:57.552 --> 00:03:01.056
Your pure white hair
makes me think of snowdrifts.

00:03:01.098 --> 00:03:02.724
[KODAMA]
And?

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:07.104
And your lips are as blue
and as vibrant as the sky.

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:08.814
What else?

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:11.983
And your eyes...

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.653
I see more kindness
in them than ever.

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.574
[KODAMA]
Please don't look away.

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:21.576
[YAMABIKO]
But I‐‐

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:25.080
[KODAMA] I need to look into
your eyes to see myself.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.001
[KODAMA]
Hmm. You're right.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:33.422
They are kinder than before.
Way more natural.

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:35.799
They show who I really am.

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:41.805
But I realize.
Nobody else would ever say that.

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:47.477
[gasps]

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.897
[KODAMA grunts]

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.023
[gasps]

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:55.068
[YAMABIKO]
The truth is...

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.822
...I would've been willing to do
absolutely anything for her.

00:03:58.864 --> 00:04:01.742
I would have become anything
she wanted me to be.

00:04:05.454 --> 00:04:06.955
[YAMABIKO]
So.

00:04:06.997 --> 00:04:08.665
That's how this happened.

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:13.503
[YAMABIKO]
She never gave up. Not once.

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:15.422
She held on to the hope
she could save us all

00:04:15.464 --> 00:04:18.175
from that terrible sickness.

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:19.843
As the days wore on,

00:04:19.885 --> 00:04:22.929
it got more and more difficult
to look at her directly.

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:25.056
Too painful for you?

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:27.893
[YAMABIKO]
No, the opposite.

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.561
It's because she
shined so brightly,

00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:31.563
I could hardly bear it.

00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:34.149
Heh! Young love...

00:04:37.903 --> 00:04:40.363
[YAMABIKO]
The disease was savage.

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:43.658
The tumors began to spread
all over their bodies.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.329
It got so bad, they didn't
even look human anymore.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.872
And then...

00:04:48.914 --> 00:04:50.457
Are you okay?

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:52.626
You can stop if you want to.

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:54.252
[YAMABIKO]
No.

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:56.421
I think you should hear this.

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:59.633
Things got worse, but they
still had a glimmer of hope

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:01.051
left in their hearts.

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:03.428
Everyone truly believed
that she'd find a way

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.430
to cure them somehow.

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:08.225
She sounds like
an amazing person.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:09.559
[YAMABIKO]
Yeah.

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:11.937
I've seen many worlds
in my time,

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:15.273
but I've never met anybody with
the kind of power she possessed.

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:20.070
[YAMABIKO] Before I met her,
I was wandering aimlessly

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:21.905
from one world to the next.

00:05:21.947 --> 00:05:25.242
It was tough, but I felt like I
could handle that a lot better

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:27.702
than being with my classmates.

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:33.708
[YAMABIKO]
I didn't really feel sad,

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.752
but I wouldn't say I was happy.

00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:37.379
I was just existing.

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:53.478
[YAMABIKO]
One night, there was a new moon.

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:04.197
[YAMABIKO]
That's when I met her.

00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:08.326
[STUDENTS gasping]

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:11.788
[YAMABIKO gasps]

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.748
Tell me your name.

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:17.127
Y‐Yamabiko.

00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:19.045
I'm Kodama.

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:21.339
Hmm?
[sneezes]

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:22.799
[giggles]

00:06:31.308 --> 00:06:32.309
[YAMABIKO]
Seemed like she had control

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.394
of everything in this world.

00:06:34.436 --> 00:06:36.563
She could do whatever
she wanted.

00:06:36.605 --> 00:06:38.982
The others referred
to her power as "M,"

00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:42.027
and treated her like a god.
Practically worshipped her.

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:02.380
[KODAMA]
What am I gonna do with you?

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:07.135
[KODAMA]
You always need something, huh?

00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:12.182
Fly away and be careful.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:16.937
[KODAMA]
Sleep well?

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:19.898
I bet it's been quite a while
since you slept in a bed.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.107
Yeah.

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:24.861
So do you have some kind
of special power, too?

00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:28.031
No, I don't.
Just a normal homeless guy.

00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:29.574
Then you're a traveler.

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:31.159
That's pretty cool!

00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:33.995
Guess that's one way to put it.

00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:35.997
We traveled around to
lots of different places

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:38.208
before coming here.

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:41.169
But this is where
we ended up settling down.

00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:43.046
It's peaceful and
easy to live in.

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:44.756
It's kinda hard to believe.

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:47.217
Didn't know it
could be like this.

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:48.885
Yeah, maybe.

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:51.846
Hey, how come
a guy like you is alone?

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:54.474
I'm guessing you didn't drift
all by yourself, did you?

00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:55.684
What do you want from me?

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:56.685
[gasps]

00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:59.104
[YAMABIKO]
I don't have anything valuable,

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:03.108
or any kind of power
that can help you.

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:05.151
I've got nothing to offer

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:07.028
You have stories.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.989
[YAMABIKO]
Hmm?

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.658
I wanna hear about all
the worlds you've been to.

00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:15.745
[YAMABIKO]
Not much to talk about.

00:08:15.787 --> 00:08:17.372
[KODAMA]
There's gotta be something.

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:19.833
I really don't care if
it's just a bunch of nonsense.

00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:23.086
We're practically dying
for anything new.

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:27.007
So after supper's over,
it's story time, okay?

00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:28.883
[YAMABIKO]
Do I have a say in this?

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:32.595
Well, it's a still early,
so let's make it nighttime.

00:08:32.637 --> 00:08:34.764
And I'd love a full moon.

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:39.561
[KODAMA]
Okay, I'm looking forward to it.

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:40.854
[YAMABIKO]
Wait!

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.150
[gasps]

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:46.901
[KODAMA]
Dinner's ready, you guys!

00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:50.530
Treat me like an idiot.

00:08:50.572 --> 00:08:52.490
[YAMABIKO] No one had been
kind to me like that before

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:55.910
and it got under my skin.
I wasn't buying any of it.

00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:02.250
[YAMABIKO]
Everyone's so fake.

00:09:06.337 --> 00:09:09.090
None of those guys
believed me, anyway.

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:16.765
[YAMABIKO]
Ah...

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:18.475
Hey.

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:19.851
[YAMABIKO gasps]

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:24.355
[KODAMA]
Not so good cold, is it?

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:26.691
Here, while it's still hot.

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:30.779
I'll pass.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.905
Help yourself‐‐

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:33.364
[YAMABIKO]
I said no, okay?

00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:42.165
[YAMABIKO]
Ugh. Damn it!

00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:44.375
I don't need any of this!

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:45.960
And I don't need her!

00:09:57.514 --> 00:09:59.099
[KODAMA]
How 'bout now?

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.308
I understand.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.560
Don't wanna burn
your tongue, huh?

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:04.229
What?

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.397
[KODAMA]
Mm! Perfect.

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:07.899
Why don't you try some?

00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:10.568
‐‐Well, I‐‐
‐‐[KODAMA] Just try it.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:11.986
[YAMABIKO sighs]

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:21.663
Well?

00:10:22.705 --> 00:10:24.415
What can I say?

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:31.005
It's way too salty.

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:34.050
Yeah, you're right.

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:36.511
Guess I must've have put in
a little too much salt.

00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:40.306
This has gotta be
the saltiest thing ever.

00:10:40.348 --> 00:10:41.766
Can hardly believe it.

00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:45.061
Yeah. I'll be more
careful next time.

00:10:45.103 --> 00:10:49.274
[YAMABIKO] I was so embarrassed
and frustrated with myself.

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:51.651
But I gotta say, I was happy.

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:55.864
[MIZUHO] You're a surprisingly
simple guy, huh?

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:58.992
[NAGARA]
Mm. I can kinda relate to that.

00:10:59.033 --> 00:10:59.993
[MIZUHO groans]

00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:01.661
[NAGARA]
I said "kinda"!

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:04.330
[STUDENTS chuckling]

00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:05.832
I guess I failed again.

00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:06.833
It figures.

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:07.959
Is that so?

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:12.088
Yeah. Seems like all I ever do
is regret what I've done.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:15.175
Wasted most of my life wrapped
up in feeling that way.

00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:17.844
Then, of course,
I regret wasting my time.

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:21.181
Well, at least you've mastered
the art of regretting by now.

00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:23.892
Oh, come on, you've gotta
have a few regrets.

00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:25.727
I mean, like,
what about drifting away

00:11:25.768 --> 00:11:27.437
from our old world?

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.730
I don't mind.

00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:30.148
But why not?

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.735
Easy. I'm not here because
of some choice that I made.

00:11:33.776 --> 00:11:36.029
I went to school
just like always.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.448
Honestly, I was just
having a normal day.

00:11:38.489 --> 00:11:41.367
Next thing I knew, I wasn't.

00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:44.621
There's just nothing there
for me to regret having done.

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:46.122
You know?

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:47.582
[YAMABIKO]
Hmm.

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:52.503
[KODAMA] Like it or not, all we
can do in life is move forward.

00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:58.176
[YAMABIKO] I started to think,
this might be the last stop

00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:00.887
of the long journey I'd been on.

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:03.306
That I'd made it
to my destination.

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:06.142
That I could stay forever.

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:08.895
That these
days finding happiness...

00:12:08.937 --> 00:12:10.980
...would last forever.

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:14.817
[BOY 08A]
How long has he been down here?

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:17.070
[GIRL 08A] You thought
a bird was making noise?

00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:18.821
[GIRL 08B]
Who is he?

00:12:25.828 --> 00:12:27.705
Will you tell me
what your name is?

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:29.249
[coughs]

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.667
[groans]

00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:35.880
‐‐Ah!
‐‐[gasping]

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:38.591
[rasping, grunting]

00:12:38.633 --> 00:12:40.260
[gasps]

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:42.428
You are so...

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.681
You look... so disgusting...

00:12:44.722 --> 00:12:46.599
[gasps]

00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:48.559
[retches]

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:56.693
[YAMABIKO] Have you heard
what they're saying?

00:12:56.734 --> 00:12:59.153
People are wondering
if he caused this plague.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.448
[KODAMA]
Yeah. He probably did.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:05.493
[YAMABIKO] So what are
you gonna do with him?

00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:07.245
[KODAMA]
Well, I'm not sure.

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:11.249
All I know, is I don't
wanna abandon him.

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:15.211
As soon as he saw me,
he said I looked disgusting.

00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:17.839
Didn't even hesitate.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.550
He was kind enough to be honest.

00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:23.261
Plus, if I can find out
what's causing all these tumors,

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:26.806
I think I can use my power
to do something about them.

00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:28.766
So what should I do?

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:31.728
Come on.
You have to have some ideas.

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:34.564
[YAMABIKO]
I...

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.902
[YAMABIKO] I think you're
doing the right thing.

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:45.283
Oh, really? And that's
your honest opinion?

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:48.703
[YAMABIKO]
Of course, are you ever wrong?

00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:50.121
You're not.

00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:56.252
[KODAMA] Well. I'm not perfect,
if that's what you're saying.

00:13:56.294 --> 00:13:57.253
[YAMABIKO gasps]

00:13:57.295 --> 00:14:00.131
[KODAMA] He reminds me of you,
at least how you were

00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:02.050
when you first arrived.

00:14:04.719 --> 00:14:08.181
[YAMABIKO] I saw the mistakes
she was making.

00:14:08.222 --> 00:14:09.766
And I looked the other way.

00:14:10.933 --> 00:14:12.977
[YAMABIKO]
I should've said something.

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:16.230
Tried to steer her
in another direction.

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:18.274
But I just couldn't.

00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:20.276
Why not?

00:14:20.318 --> 00:14:22.070
[YAMABIKO]
I've thought about that.

00:14:22.111 --> 00:14:26.949
It's because I believed
in her‐‐more than in myself.

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:34.040
[KODAMA]
You're okay.

00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:36.209
Let me check again tomorrow.

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.586
That's what you said yesterday.

00:14:38.628 --> 00:14:39.921
Well, I...

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:45.718
He turned into this...

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.390
You literally just told him
that he'd be okay.

00:14:50.431 --> 00:14:51.474
[KODAMA]
Let me look.

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:53.434
‐‐Maybe‐‐
‐‐[GIRL 08D] Don't touch him!

00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:56.729
It's 'cause you
let him stay here.

00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:58.856
He brought this terrible
disease with him!

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:02.485
We should've killed him
as soon as we had the chance.

00:15:02.527 --> 00:15:04.904
[YAMABIKO grunts]

00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:06.823
[gunshot]

00:15:08.866 --> 00:15:11.119
[STRANGER] When I said you were
disgusting, that was a lie.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.371
So don't worry.

00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:16.332
If I'm being totally honest,
I think you're beautiful.

00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:18.709
So then, why did you lie to me?

00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:20.628
I wanted you to like me.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:23.423
And I decided to tell you
what you wanted to hear.

00:15:23.464 --> 00:15:26.467
Do you not care about
other people's feelings?

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:28.928
[STRANGER]
I get that question a lot.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.973
You're the cause of
these tumors, aren't you?

00:15:32.014 --> 00:15:34.016
[STRANGER]
Mm‐hmm. I am.

00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:36.310
This disease is my gift to you.

00:15:36.352 --> 00:15:38.354
Then how do I
get rid of the tumors?

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:40.189
With the power I have...

00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:42.733
...I should be able
to cure them.

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:46.028
[STRANGER] Only thing I can tell
you is that they can't be cured.

00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:49.740
Surely, you understand
that, don't you?

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:53.286
I'm not the only thing
that's causing them.

00:15:53.327 --> 00:15:55.872
Okay. Goodbye.

00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:57.540
I don't have time for this.

00:15:57.582 --> 00:15:59.500
[gasps]
No, wait!

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:00.835
I've got something for you!

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:02.170
Okay?

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:07.258
What's this?

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.718
[STRANGER]
Isn't it pretty?

00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:11.220
It's an award. it's what you get
for killing a hundred people.

00:16:11.262 --> 00:16:12.513
[gasps]

00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:14.015
This is for a thousand.

00:16:14.056 --> 00:16:15.850
And ten thousand...

00:16:15.892 --> 00:16:17.894
See? Aren't they pretty?

00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:21.105
[KODAMA growls]
No! They're awful!

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:22.648
[STRANGER]
I'm sorry!

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.276
No matter what I do,
it's always wrong somehow.

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:29.030
Everyone I meet ends up
despising me, every single time.

00:16:29.071 --> 00:16:30.823
What am I supposed to do?

00:16:30.865 --> 00:16:31.908
I hate this!

00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:34.785
[KODAMA]
Just stay away from us, okay?

00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:37.246
[STRANGER] No, please!
Please don't be afraid of me!

00:16:37.288 --> 00:16:39.790
Go, and never
come back here again!

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:44.045
[STRANGER snarls]

00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:46.672
Damn it! Always happens!

00:16:46.714 --> 00:16:49.967
Why?! I hate this!

00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:53.012
You never caught the
disease they had, did you?

00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:54.472
[YAMABIKO]
No.

00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:57.058
And to this day
I feel terrible about it.

00:16:57.099 --> 00:17:00.895
He said it wasn't really
a plague in the normal sense.

00:17:00.937 --> 00:17:04.232
It was like a different
kind of This World.

00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:08.361
One where mental wounds
manifested as painful tumors.

00:17:08.402 --> 00:17:12.281
He called that world "Scar Art."

00:17:12.323 --> 00:17:14.700
[STRANGER]
Yeah, this is my art form.

00:17:14.742 --> 00:17:17.411
Hopefully, I'll collect
a lot more of these.

00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:20.039
So you want to see it?

00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:21.165
Come over here.

00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:22.166
[YAMABIKO growls]

00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:24.627
[STRANGER] Hey. Aren't you
curious why you're the only one

00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:28.506
who's not sick and
covered in carbuncles?

00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:30.633
There's a good reason for it.

00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:31.926
Want me to tell?

00:17:31.968 --> 00:17:35.555
It's because this world
is entirely your creation.

00:17:35.596 --> 00:17:37.098
[YAMABIKO gasps]

00:17:37.139 --> 00:17:40.184
[YAMABIKO] I hadn't realized
it until that point.

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:44.063
The ability to materialize
what was inside my mind.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.072
[YAMABIKO]
That was my power.

00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:56.033
[YAMABIKO] At some point,
in all my wandering.

00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:58.869
I'd become locked inside
a shell of myself.

00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:02.498
That's why I was the only one
who didn't get sick, and why,

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:07.169
given the circumstances,
Kodama's powers couldn't help.

00:18:07.211 --> 00:18:08.462
[STRANGER]
You may not want to hear this,

00:18:08.504 --> 00:18:10.131
but these sores are
caused by things

00:18:10.172 --> 00:18:12.550
happening outside of this world.

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:15.720
The only way to cure them
is to resolve those issues.

00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:17.763
[YAMABIKO]
Well, how do I do that?

00:18:17.805 --> 00:18:19.974
[STRANGER] All you have
to do is change yourself.

00:18:20.016 --> 00:18:22.184
Just crack open that
little shell you've created

00:18:22.226 --> 00:18:23.811
and fly out.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:25.896
[STRANGER]
At this point, however,

00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:27.898
I'm afraid it's too late.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.233
I'm leaving.

00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:36.282
[YAMABIKO snarls]

00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:37.450
[STRANGER]
I get it.

00:18:37.491 --> 00:18:39.285
I know how you feel.

00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:40.995
It's extremely frustrating.

00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:43.748
But there's nothing
we discarded ones can do.

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:45.416
There's no other option here.

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:47.710
I mean, you've heard
the voice, too, right?

00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:51.213
[YAMABIKO]
Who the hell are you, really?

00:18:51.255 --> 00:18:52.757
[STRANGER]
We've met before.

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:55.468
Though it appears you
don't remember me at all.

00:18:55.509 --> 00:18:57.970
You have seen me around.

00:18:58.012 --> 00:19:01.974
Not once, but many times,
in fact, and in many places.

00:19:02.016 --> 00:19:04.644
[YAMABIKO growling]

00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:07.813
[WAR]
There, there, you're a good boy.

00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:11.275
It's just unfortunate that
you lack the courage necessary.

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:13.861
With just a little bit of that,
you could've saved her.

00:19:13.903 --> 00:19:16.364
She'd been waiting
for you to come along.

00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:21.243
Eerily nice and pleasant, but
surprisingly simple and dull.

00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:23.788
No doubt that
this is your world.

00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:25.998
All right then, farewell.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.167
But before I go...

00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:30.586
...I neglected
to tell you earlier,

00:19:30.628 --> 00:19:32.171
but you should probably know...

00:19:32.213 --> 00:19:33.839
...my name's War.

00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:38.636
[KODAMA]
I kept telling him to fly away.

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:41.514
But this is still my fault.

00:19:41.555 --> 00:19:44.934
'Cause if I'd never interfered,
he might have flown off

00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:46.519
somewhere better.

00:19:48.562 --> 00:19:50.940
It's funny. I thought
I was helping him,

00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:54.151
but it turns out I was
only holding him back.

00:19:55.194 --> 00:19:56.737
Yamabiko...

00:19:56.779 --> 00:19:58.322
[YAMABIKO]
Yeah, what?

00:19:58.364 --> 00:20:00.741
[KODAMA] You'll do anything
I ask, won't you?

00:20:00.783 --> 00:20:02.284
[YAMABIKO]
'Course I will.

00:20:02.326 --> 00:20:06.288
[KODAMA] All I'm asking of you,
is to make good on this promise.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.999
Please, fly away from here.

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:10.126
[YAMABIKO grunts]

00:20:10.167 --> 00:20:13.003
[KODAMA] This place...
is not the real world.

00:20:16.173 --> 00:20:17.258
[KODAMA grunts]

00:20:17.299 --> 00:20:18.634
I'm okay.

00:20:19.593 --> 00:20:24.557
[KODAMA groans softly] Just...
promise you'll do that, okay?

00:20:24.598 --> 00:20:26.350
I know you can...

00:20:26.392 --> 00:20:27.643
[YAMABIKO]
Mm‐hmm.

00:20:27.685 --> 00:20:29.854
Because... you...

00:20:36.944 --> 00:20:39.697
[YAMABIKO] And that's how a dog,
all on his own,

00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:42.867
found himself in
the forest for so long.

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:46.954
[YAMABIKO]
The truth is...

00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:49.623
...I had so many chances.

00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:52.668
I could've saved
her at any time.

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:55.671
But I never opened
my eyes to see that.

00:20:55.713 --> 00:20:57.047
All she wanted...

00:20:57.089 --> 00:20:59.258
...was to walk by my side.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:04.180
Travel though the worlds
with me as my companion.

00:21:04.221 --> 00:21:07.183
She waited for me for so long.

00:21:07.224 --> 00:21:09.977
And when I found her,
I didn't step up and do

00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:11.979
what I needed to do.

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:16.650
[YAMABIKO]
Sorry to blab at you like this.

00:21:16.692 --> 00:21:18.152
[MIZUHO]
Yamabiko?

00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:19.487
[YAMABIKO]
Yeah?

00:21:19.528 --> 00:21:21.447
[MIZUHO]
Can I sleep with you tonight?

00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:31.540
[KODAMA]
You promised me, remember?

00:21:33.876 --> 00:21:34.877
[YAMABIKO gasps]

00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:36.504
[KODAMA]
That we'd go together.

00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:38.923
Take a nice stroll down
that long road of bones

00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:40.508
you told me about.

00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:43.844
We'll talk, and maybe
even eat some ice cream...

00:21:43.886 --> 00:21:45.763
[YAMABIKO]
Yeah.

00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:48.432
Just us...

00:21:48.474 --> 00:21:50.309
[YAMABIKO whimpers]

00:22:00.027 --> 00:22:01.946
[YAMABIKO]
Can't sleep?

00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:02.947
Yeah.

00:22:02.988 --> 00:22:05.574
I have a lot on my mind.

00:22:05.616 --> 00:22:09.245
I keep thinking, like, about
choices I've made and stuff.

00:22:09.286 --> 00:22:11.455
Things I did or didn't do.

00:22:11.497 --> 00:22:12.665
I don't know...

00:22:12.706 --> 00:22:15.084
I can't go back
and change things now.

00:22:15.125 --> 00:22:17.628
It's just keeping me up.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:21.841
[YAMABIKO] I realized that I
just wanted to be in the light.

00:22:21.882 --> 00:22:26.595
But I was so afraid of
losing it, that I was paralyzed.

00:22:28.764 --> 00:22:32.309
[YAMABIKO] But... I finally
came out of my shell.

00:22:37.606 --> 00:22:40.401
[YAMABIKO]
After 5,000 years.

00:22:40.442 --> 00:22:42.611
I don't know if I can.

00:22:42.653 --> 00:22:46.407
[YAMABIKO]
Yeah... you can.

00:22:46.448 --> 00:22:47.700
[NAGARA gasps]

00:22:54.707 --> 00:22:56.041
[MIZUHO]
Nozomi!

00:22:56.083 --> 00:22:57.001
Glad you're here!

00:22:57.042 --> 00:22:59.670
[NOZOMI growls]
You're so late!

00:22:59.712 --> 00:23:01.297
[NAGARA]
This is when we said we'd meet.

00:23:01.338 --> 00:23:02.673
[NOZOMI]
Ugh! Nuh‐uh!

00:23:02.715 --> 00:23:05.551
We said we were gonna meet up
two weeks ago! See?

00:23:06.468 --> 00:23:08.721
My clock's different.

00:23:08.762 --> 00:23:11.181
[NOZOMI]
Hmm? Oh, that's weird.

00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:12.850
[YAMABIKO] Seems like
time was flowing differently

00:23:12.892 --> 00:23:14.351
for you guys.

00:23:16.729 --> 00:23:19.231
Now we're back in sync.

00:23:19.273 --> 00:23:20.482
Yeah.

00:23:22.776 --> 00:23:26.155
[NOZOMI] Whoa, so all that
stuff happened on the island?

00:23:26.196 --> 00:23:28.032
Did you ever find out
who this "War" guy

00:23:28.073 --> 00:23:30.159
was even fighting against?

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.953
[YAMABIKO] His main objective
was killing God.

00:23:32.995 --> 00:23:35.789
[NOZOMI]
Mm? Can someone really do that?

00:23:35.831 --> 00:23:37.291
[YAMABIKO]
Dunno.

00:23:37.333 --> 00:23:39.543
Even if he did kill God...

00:23:39.585 --> 00:23:41.545
...would that change anything?
