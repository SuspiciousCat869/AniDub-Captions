00:00:08.634 --> 00:00:11.678
[GEN] It's been kinda boring
with so few orders lately.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.763
[TORA]
This should be the norm.

00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:15.516
We were working like it was
constantly Black Friday before‐‐

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:17.184
It's too much.

00:00:17.226 --> 00:00:18.685
Go to an animal rights group‐‐

00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:20.771
or, well, whatever
the appropriate outfit is‐‐

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:23.774
and we might have a real claim
to some fair compensation!

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:26.026
Wow. Would you listen to you?

00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:28.570
Really starting to sound
like a human lately, huh?

00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:31.198
Hey, cats have to
assert their rights, too!

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.075
These days, we're finally
being recognized as

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:35.202
the respectable
creatures that we are,

00:00:35.244 --> 00:00:37.371
not just the property of humans.

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:39.289
Get with the times.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:42.251
We're just cats though.

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:44.753
I think you're making a mountain
out of a molehill here.

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:47.464
Though, I can agree that
we're deserving of some dignity.

00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:49.091
More than we have now, at least.

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:52.135
Uh‐huh. Wish they'd take
a page out of our book.

00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:54.012
But unlike us furry beasts,
those hairless,

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:56.890
self‐centered animals
can be completely heartless.

00:00:56.932 --> 00:00:58.976
No sense counting
on them for anything.

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:01.311
Might have to
fend for ourselves.

00:01:01.353 --> 00:01:03.772
Hey, guys, food's ready.

00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:22.708
Just sitting under
the kotatsu...

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.918
...kinda makes me
wanna eat some ice cream.

00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:33.719
[MIZUHO sobbing]
Grandma, you meanie!

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.846
‐‐I want ice cream!
‐‐Too bad!

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:38.724
[MIZUHO wails]
I hate you!

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:48.233
[sighs]
Normally, right about now,...

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:50.944
...there'd be some
boring news on the TV...

00:01:50.986 --> 00:01:54.740
...and Mom would be putting her
gross cooking on the table.

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.033
That takes me back.

00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:58.410
Her mom hated us
something terrible, huh?

00:01:58.452 --> 00:02:00.912
She was always blaming us for
the dust around the house

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.164
because she couldn't
tell the difference

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:04.291
between it and cat hair.

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:06.543
I wish I could go back home.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.214
[TORA, GEN]
Hmm...?

00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:14.635
There she goes, wishing
for the impossible again.

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:17.429
For heaven's sake,
she's hopeless.

00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:19.973
I don't know, Mizuho's 16
years old already!

00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:21.933
If she were a cat, we'd think
it was weird if she hadn't

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:23.393
had kittens yet.

00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:26.271
Oh‐ho! Who's not with
the times now?

00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:28.732
No one should be expected
to have kittens.

00:02:28.774 --> 00:02:30.567
[TORA]
Go eat grass.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:34.071
Mizuho is still a child.

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.617
[MIZUHO slurping]

00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:45.332
[SAKURA] Without us around,
she wouldn't survive.

00:02:45.374 --> 00:02:47.876
[MIZUHO grunting]

00:02:47.918 --> 00:02:49.878
Okay, ice cream time.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.005
Meow?

00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:53.924
And this'll be your reward.

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:54.925
Mrawr!

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:56.802

Nope! Not until you get back.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:59.596
[GEN]
Mrr...

00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:01.598
[SAKURA] What did she want
us to get this time?

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.100
[TORA]
Ice cream.

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:04.184
And how quickly?

00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:05.644
[TORA]
Right away, of course.

00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:07.020
Is there enough time?

00:03:07.062 --> 00:03:10.148
[GEN] Hmm... Guess we'll
just try our best.

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:12.359
[YAMABIKO grunts]

00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:13.652
[NOZOMI, NAGARA]
Hmm?

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:25.038
Are you three warriors
here to fight in our battle?

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.581
[NAGARA]
I wouldn't say that.

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:28.166
[SOU]
Then why are you here?!

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:29.126
[NAGARA]
Just dropping by,

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:31.378
'cause we're hoping we
could talk, or something.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.963
[MIZUHO] What my friend
here is trying to say,

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:34.673
is we want you
to make up with Seiji,

00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:38.093
'cause your little spat is
annoying everyone else.

00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:39.553
Impossible!

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:42.597
There is nothing but the duel
between my brother and I!

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.059
[GEN sighs]
Made it in time.

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:47.060
Hmm?

00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:48.895
[SOU] If you don't want
to be caught up in it,

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:51.356
then you should
leave this place, now!

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.776
Ooh. Scary.

00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:56.903
What are we supposed to do now?

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:03.034
[SEIJI] I hate to say
I told you so, but...

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:07.330
Your twin brother is quite
the... Shall we say say, uh...

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:09.374
Grouchy one, huh?

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:13.253
[SEIJI] Yeah. Unlike me,
he's really narrow‐minded.

00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:17.257
Okay? But is it true you're
fighting over a strand of hair?

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:18.425
‐‐[SEIJI] Yeah!
‐‐[MIZUHO] Hmm?

00:04:18.467 --> 00:04:23.180
It's 110,635, to 110,634!

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:25.265
I have one more than he does.

00:04:25.307 --> 00:04:28.268
We've counted a million times,
so, we're sure.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.479
[MIZUHO] Talk about
wigging out over nothing.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.481
[SEIJI]
Hmph. Then we agree.

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:34.065
If he could just admit
that I've beaten him,

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:36.777
this would all be over.

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:40.572
But still, Nagara, Mizuho,
I appreciate you coming.

00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:42.574
I'm glad I told
Nozomi about this.

00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:44.159
We'll help however we can.

00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:45.619

Mm‐hmm.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.704
We all got caught up
in their squabble.

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:50.624
Ms. Aki's gone,
so we can't leave, and...

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:55.545
Huh? What's that look about?

00:04:55.587 --> 00:04:57.380
Nothing. Kinda
wondering how long

00:04:57.422 --> 00:04:59.090
you're just gonna sit there.

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:00.675
Shut up, will ya?

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:09.976
So mature.

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:11.394

Tch. You make me wanna hurl.

All of you.

00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:25.325
[TORA]
Ah, that poor kid.

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:28.411
Always stompin' off and sulking
when he feels snubbed.

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:30.956
I bet he got
shot down by Nozomi.

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:33.291
He just can't seem
to win her over.

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.752
Harsh, but accurate.

00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:37.420
[AKI] If we're going
to change the world,

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:40.257
then we'll need the power
that those twins have.

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:43.385
But... it's not like
we need both of them.

00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:46.763
[KAGA]
Dosukoi!

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:49.391

Wrong! Watch and learn!

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:53.353
[SOU]

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:55.939
Private Kaga, your turn!

00:05:57.983 --> 00:06:00.110
[KAGA]
Dosukoi!

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.702
Hey, kid! This is an awfully
fine piece of meat you got here!

00:06:08.743 --> 00:06:10.662
Tell me where you got it!

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:13.498
Uh. From Seiji!
He gave it to me!

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.125

Don't sumo talk to me,
you stupid idiot!

00:06:17.752 --> 00:06:20.046

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:25.677
[AKI] Why?! Can't you keep
your promises?! Moron!

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:27.095
[MIZUHO]
So we're sure?

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:29.431
These guys are only fighting
over that single strand of hair,

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:30.849
and that's it?

00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:33.101
Yeah, that's what he said.

00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:34.895
Ah. You're not thinking...

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:36.855
Yup. You realize it, too?

00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:38.732
We can just pluck a hair off
the one who has more,

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:40.901
and shove it in
both their faces.

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:42.819
[NAGARA] You think it's
gonna be that easy?

00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:45.822
[NOZOMI] Well, do you have
any better ideas?

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:48.158
[NAGARA]
Hmm... Hair transplant?

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:50.076
[gasping]

00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:52.162
There's a power
holdover that does that.

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:53.413
At least, I think.

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:54.831

00:06:58.501 --> 00:06:59.502

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:05.133
[grunting]

00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:07.385
Hey, was that...?

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:09.721
Yeah, "Reverse."

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.856
[SEIJI] What'll it be?
How do we fight this time?

00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:24.402
[KOSSETSU] The power the twins
have, "Reverse,"

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:28.114
can rewind everything and
basically reset the world.

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:31.910
We were thinking, with it, those
of us that are stuck in stasis,

00:07:31.952 --> 00:07:35.956
might be able to rewind back
to before we went adrift.

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:37.499
But no luck?

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.418
Well, this whole world is
a giant, barren crater.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.171
It could have been reset
any number of times already.

00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:46.091
And if there's no trace left
behind, they might not remember

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:47.717
anything outside of their fight.

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:49.386
[MIZUHO]
Guess that makes sense.

00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:53.431
Uh‐huh. And plus, since they
can both use the power,

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:55.058
even if one of them
reverses things,

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.685
the other can just do the same.

00:07:56.726 --> 00:08:00.271
Then that initial rewinding gets
rewound back to the way it was.

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:02.857
Which is how this has gone on
for thousands of years.

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:05.568
They call it
a "Reverse‐Reverse."

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.113
[NOZOMI] True, but Sou
and Seiji aren't just battling

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:09.864
with their powers.

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:11.992
There's also the duel they
always have with each other

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:14.452
when their ability activates.

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:16.079
They have a duel?

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:17.080
[NOZOMI]
Mm‐hmm.

00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:21.710

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:53.241
[MIZUHO]
Wow, that's amazing!

00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:56.786
It actually resets everything,
like a cheat‐code or something.

00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:59.122
[NAGARA]
Hmm? What's this?

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:05.253
[NAGARA]
"Sou Seiji."

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:09.257
[MIZUHO gasps] Wait, so they're
not actually twins?

00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:10.675
Does this mean...?

00:09:14.012 --> 00:09:16.514
[AKI]
You must feel pretty pathetic.

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:18.516
You keep losing to yourself.

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:21.895
That guy isn't me!
'Cause I'm me, got it?!

00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:23.605
Would you like some help?

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:24.856
No!

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:28.193
You two may have started
out being the same...

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:30.236
...but you're
very different now.

I'll beat him on my own.

[AKI] You're a believer,
too, aren't you?

00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:38.495
[SOU grunts]

00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:45.168
Take this. Think of it as
God's divine protection.

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:49.089
[YAMABIKO] They look
the same at a glance,

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.382
but they're not
perfectly identical.

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:54.135
There are slight
variations in each copy.

00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:55.678
Shut up, dog.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.805
[YAMABIKO]
I heard that.

00:09:56.846 --> 00:10:01.142
[SAKURA gasps]
You've been listening to us?!

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:03.603
Only recently.

00:10:03.645 --> 00:10:05.522
[SAKURA] It speaks poorly
of your character to have

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:07.398
kept that to yourself.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.819
Never felt like the
right time to bring it up.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.654
[SAKURA]
Hmph.

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:15.615
Nyamazon stuff is a
bunch of copies, right?

00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:17.450
Why are you asking me?

00:10:17.492 --> 00:10:18.701
Why?

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:21.204
'Cause you're the one
doing the copying.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.458
[SAKURA] You know what?
You're not so bad.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.128
You're unusually
negative for a dog.

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:31.422
But more importantly,
you're good to Mizuho.

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:33.591
The reason we've
kept this to ourselves

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:35.301
is for her sake, alone.

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:39.430
If word got out, people would
blame her for everything.

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:42.392
[YAMABIKO] Then again,
if it had gotten out,

00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:43.852
I'm sure they would
have been able to return

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:45.728
when they had the chance.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.897
[YAMABIKO]
Back to the future they wanted.

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:52.694
[YAMABIKO] Are you sure you kept
it to yourselves for her sake?

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:55.321
What are you saying?

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:58.408
[YAMABIKO] That you're actually
doing it for yourselves.

00:10:58.449 --> 00:11:00.034
You're afraid that
if you leave Mizuho‐‐

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:01.578
[SAKURA]
Incorrect.

00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:05.832
That girl can't get by
without me watching over her.

00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:08.793
[YAMABIKO] I don't think
that's true, personally.

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:17.302
[SAKURA] The first one to
catch on was that curious boy.

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:19.804
He's unusually smart
for his age.

00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:23.433
[MIZUHO] Fifty USB cables,
and a box of Sudakosan Taro.

00:11:23.474 --> 00:11:26.895
Wait, what's this "Tokimeki
Tick High School" thing?

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:29.439
[RAJDHANI] A video game I made
for the PocketGame system,

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.107
thanks to some crowd‐funding.

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:33.026
You created it? So cool!

00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:35.862
Yup! But only one
copy was ever sold.

00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:38.531
So it became a legendary
one‐of‐a‐kind item!

00:11:38.573 --> 00:11:40.742
Folks went crazy
trying to get a hold of it.

00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:43.745
Ah! Man, you're really something
else, you know that?

00:11:43.786 --> 00:11:45.163
What kinda game is it?

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:47.373
[RAJDHANI] It's a really
difficult, unfair one.

00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:50.668
The goal is to find a single
predetermined tick in your class

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.629
out of trillions
of possibilities.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.505
then, get it to
fall in love with you.

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:56.049
It's basically a dating sim.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.259
Whoa! That's super interesting!

00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:01.596
I put a lot of time into
programming the ticks' emotions.

00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:04.182
Anyway, I need it for
reference for this next world

00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:06.309
we're conquering.
Is that okay?

00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:09.395
Sure. Oh, but I can't get these.

00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:11.773
I've tried it
a few times myself,

00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:14.234
but those cats won't bring me
anything that's alive.

00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:17.487
[sighs]
I was afraid of that.

00:12:17.528 --> 00:12:19.030
[MIZUHO]
Thank you.

00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:25.662
[RAJDHANI sighs]

00:12:27.538 --> 00:12:29.707
[SAKURA]
Meeow!

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:30.917
[RAJDHANI]
Hmm?

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:34.170
[RAJDHANI]
Huh?

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:39.008
The only one of
its kind in the world,

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.760
but there's two?

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:47.100
As it turns out,
we have all been copied.

00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:48.726
[MIZUHO sighs]

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:49.894
[SAKURA]
He had a feeling.

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:53.064
He knew that he did not fully
understand Mizuho's power.

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:55.566
Nor his own, for that matter.

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.694
[MIZUHO]
Hey, what should I do?

00:12:58.695 --> 00:13:01.698
I don't really understand
my power at all.

00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:06.452
[SAKURA] It was then,
he chose a different subject

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:08.830
to investigate.

00:13:08.871 --> 00:13:10.790
Are you all copies, too?

00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:14.961
[RAJDHANI] It's likely that
"Nyamazon," Mizuho's power,

00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:16.337
is actually copying.

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:17.588
Though if that's true...

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.466
But those cats won't bring me
anything that's alive.

00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:22.677
...it's not exactly adding up.

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:25.596
[SAKURA]
He was close.

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:28.391
Close to the truth
about going adrift.

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:31.060
Mizuho. Could I borrow
your cats for a bit?

00:13:31.102 --> 00:13:32.854
There's something
I want to investigate.

00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:34.230
‐‐Meow?
‐‐[MIZUHO] Okay.

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:36.691
[RAJDHANI]
Oh. Hey!

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:38.109
‐‐[SAKURA yowls]
‐‐[RAJDHANI] Gah!

00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:44.949
You are a cat.
Your name is Tora.

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:46.826
[TORA]
Mrowr...

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:48.703
[RAJDHANI] Are you the one
who coughed up a hairball

00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:52.457
on my keyboard two days ago?

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:55.126
Good. On to the next question.

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:57.086
This one has to do with
how you typically bring us

00:13:57.128 --> 00:13:59.088
the things we ask for.

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:03.801
What you bring us
aren't the original items.

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:06.220
They're copies from
our world, right?

00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:09.057
If you answer me,
I'll give you this.

00:14:09.098 --> 00:14:10.058
Meow!

00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:11.476
[SAKURA hisses]

00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:13.936
That's a good boy.
Next question.

00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:16.147
You guys are lying
to us, aren't you?

00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:20.026
[RAJDHANI] You really can bring
us living creatures, can't you?

00:14:20.068 --> 00:14:22.195
Mrowr...

00:14:22.236 --> 00:14:24.072
[RAJDHANI] But you've been
keeping that from us.

00:14:24.113 --> 00:14:26.282
Because if people found out,
it would put Mizuho in

00:14:26.324 --> 00:14:28.034
a precarious position.

00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:30.203
[yowls]

00:14:30.244 --> 00:14:32.663
So that's it...
The reason we went adrift

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:34.290
is because Mizuho's power‐‐

00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:35.416
Meow!

00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:37.460
Ah! Hey, what are you doing?!

00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:39.003
Stop, stop, stop!

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:41.130
[grunts]
Ah! Hey!

00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:47.011
[SAKURA] I was terrified that he
would announce it to everyone,

00:14:47.053 --> 00:14:51.641
but instead, he went off on
a solo journey without a word.

00:14:51.682 --> 00:14:54.435
He has good character,
for being so hairless.

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:57.980
Plus, it's not like
Mizuho's the only cause.

00:14:58.022 --> 00:15:01.275
Going adrift was something
that couldn't be stopped.

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:03.653
And he was well aware
of that fact.

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:07.490
[SAKURA] When we gave him
those sea monkeys

00:15:07.532 --> 00:15:10.910
as a going‐away present,
he seemed quite excited.

00:15:14.997 --> 00:15:16.582
[SAKURA sniffing]

00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:24.674
I wish I could go back home.

00:15:24.715 --> 00:15:26.926
[SEIJI]
How've things changed so much...

00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:29.846
...over a single strand
of hair on my head?

00:15:36.102 --> 00:15:37.937
Not very tasty‐looking.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.108
[NOZOMI] Then again,
is it even possible two copies

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:45.319
could have been made of someone?
We haven't seen that yet.

00:15:45.361 --> 00:15:46.612
Feels like an accident.

00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:48.906
Like when someone
screws up your food order.

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:49.907
You're right.

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:52.160
Is it possible it was just
a mistake of some kind?

00:15:52.201 --> 00:15:54.078
[GEN]
Mrr.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.247
[YAMABIKO]
Hmm?

00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:58.207
[KOSSETSU]
When they bring Kaga back...

00:15:58.249 --> 00:16:00.168
...all of us will be together.

00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:01.544
Once we do a head count,

00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:03.671
I was wondering if you guys
could take us to another world‐‐

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:05.423
‐‐Stop it.
‐‐Uh?

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:08.176
[ASAKAZE] We aren't leaving
until Ms. Aki returns.

00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:10.511
[KOSSETSU]
But...

00:16:10.553 --> 00:16:13.264
Not every world has a nice,
safe spot for people like you

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:14.474
to sit around in.

00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:15.766
[KOSSETSU sighs]

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:23.316
[NOZOMI] Hey, by "safe spot" do
you mean like this kid's bedroom

00:16:23.357 --> 00:16:25.109
you made for yourself?

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:27.570
I mean, if you're powerless,
then you can't get by

00:16:27.612 --> 00:16:29.363
on your own.

00:16:29.405 --> 00:16:31.240
Someone has to be
there to help you.

00:16:31.282 --> 00:16:32.575
Yeah, you're right.

00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:34.660
It's probably thanks to you
that I've been able to survive

00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:35.870
in this world.

00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:38.873
Then you should
do as I say. Okay?

00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:40.917
[NOZOMI]
Then again, I don't care.

00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:43.753
I'll pick where I belong on
my own, thank you very much.

00:16:43.794 --> 00:16:47.381
[ASAKAZE laughs] You can't do
anything by yourself, though.

00:16:47.423 --> 00:16:49.300
Just admit it already.

00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:51.302
You're dead weight
for everybody around you.

00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:52.303
[NOZOMI gasps]

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:54.180
[ASAKAZE] You can talk a big
game, but that doesn't mean

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:56.390
you can change anything.

00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:01.312
[MIZUHO sighs]

00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:02.313
Nozomi!

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:05.525
Let her go off by herself.

00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:07.902
She's just gonna
slow everyone down.

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:10.363
Do you actually mean that?

00:17:10.404 --> 00:17:11.906
[ASAKAZE]
I do.

00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:14.867
It's best if she
didn't go with you.

00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:17.453
That's not something
that you get to decide.

00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:19.789
Only Nozomi can do that.

00:17:26.003 --> 00:17:27.380
[NOZOMI]
Go away.

00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:28.714
[TORA]
Meow?

00:17:28.756 --> 00:17:30.591
[NOZOMI] I'm not in
a good mood right now.

00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:34.178
[NOZOMI] I keep hoping
someone would put an end

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.514
to all of this for me.

00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:38.933
To be honest, those kinds
of slippery thoughts

00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:41.352
are all that've been
on my mind lately.

00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:56.659
I recognize this.

00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:59.745
It's the kind of bear they
give to newborn babies.

00:17:59.787 --> 00:18:02.206
I had one, too,
but I threw it out.

00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:03.249
[gasps]

00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:04.667
[MIZUHO]
You know why?

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:06.961
'Cause I had cats
to take its place.

00:18:07.003 --> 00:18:10.047
They're always nice and warm,
while the bear was cold.

00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:11.215
'Cause it's dead.

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:12.216
[ASAKAZE grunts]

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:14.844
[MIZUHO] You can talk to the
bear, but it'll never respond.

00:18:14.885 --> 00:18:16.596
And the fur feels all wrong.

00:18:16.637 --> 00:18:19.140
You know, 'cause it's dead.

00:18:19.181 --> 00:18:20.433
[ASAKAZE]
Yeah, well, I‐‐

00:18:20.474 --> 00:18:22.476
Threw mine away, too...

00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:26.647
Mrowr...

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:33.029
[SAKURA]
At nighttime, in the dark,

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:36.532
she can't even go up
the stairs by herself.

00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:40.828
I'll bet she's trembling in fear
from the storm right about now.

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:46.500
[SAKURA] We can't live with
her in that house anymore.

00:18:47.793 --> 00:18:50.254
[SAKURA] I know that we're
going to get split up.

00:18:55.217 --> 00:18:56.969
[SAKURA]
She's just a child...

00:18:57.011 --> 00:18:59.263
She's still just a little...

00:19:05.102 --> 00:19:08.856
[panting]

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:15.196
[SEIJI]
I've always wondered...

00:19:15.237 --> 00:19:17.448
...what's the point
of the animal?

00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:21.786
[SEIJI] What are you gonna
do with that toy?

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:23.954
Just how far have you fallen?

00:19:25.122 --> 00:19:28.959
Ever since the day when another
me starting walking around,

00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:32.254
my only wish has been to
wipe you from existence.

00:19:32.296 --> 00:19:33.798
[SEIJI]
Good luck with that.

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:37.009
You and I both have
the same power.

00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:39.553
You've known for quite
some time, haven't you?

00:19:39.595 --> 00:19:42.056
That Seiji has
no chance of winning?

00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:44.433
[AKI]
That's why you pray.

00:19:44.475 --> 00:19:45.434
That's right.

00:19:45.476 --> 00:19:46.686
Ah?

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.689
This is yours!

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.607
Today, we're dueling.

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:52.858
[AKI]
There you go.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:57.655
You must be tired of the same
outcome every time, right?

00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:10.000
[toy gun beeping]

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.716
[toy gun beeping]

00:20:16.757 --> 00:20:19.260
[SOU]
These are no ordinary toy guns.

00:20:23.347 --> 00:20:26.475
And just now, that
was called a "skip."

00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:34.567
Finally, my wish has come true.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.366
[MIZUHO]
Sakura!

00:20:42.408 --> 00:20:45.119
[panting]

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.999
Stop it! That's god's sacrifice!

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.543
[YAMABIKO snarls]

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:57.381
[MIZUHO growls]
You realize she's still alive.

00:20:57.423 --> 00:21:01.093
Nothing's ever gonna change if
you keep clinging to somebody!

00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:02.261
[SOU grunts]

00:21:02.303 --> 00:21:05.222
Sometimes, you just have to deal
with things all by yourself!

00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:06.807
[gasps]

00:21:10.436 --> 00:21:12.146
Meow...

00:21:19.528 --> 00:21:20.863
[NAGARA]
It's too cold out here.

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:22.615
[TORA]
Mrowr...

00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:32.208
You know, I only
changed thanks to you.

00:21:35.753 --> 00:21:38.964
[NAGARA] Because...
you showed me the light.

00:21:46.347 --> 00:21:47.765
[NAGARA]
You coming?

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:49.308
[NOZOMI]
Yeah.

00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:52.520
[AKI]
Congratulations.

00:21:52.561 --> 00:21:54.104
You win.

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:57.858
So? How does it feel
now that you're the victor?

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.109
Honestly...

00:21:59.151 --> 00:22:01.153
...I dunno.

00:22:01.195 --> 00:22:03.322
It feels kinda hollow.

00:22:03.364 --> 00:22:06.158
Why is that?

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.245
Because now... I've lost...

00:22:09.286 --> 00:22:11.497
...my purpose.

00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:12.248
[gasps]

00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:13.624
[toy gun beeping]

00:22:16.585 --> 00:22:18.212
[NOZOMI]
Hey, they're back.

00:22:19.922 --> 00:22:22.216
Mrow.

00:22:22.258 --> 00:22:24.510
It's the medicine
I ordered for Sakura.

00:22:25.678 --> 00:22:29.056
[NOZOMI] Uh. Wait. Isn't she the
one who usually brings us stuff,

00:22:29.098 --> 00:22:30.266
or am I crazy?

00:22:30.307 --> 00:22:34.311
Yeah, she's always been lazy.
The others do the heavy lifting.

00:22:34.353 --> 00:22:36.939
[NOZOMI] Really? She seems
like the smartest one, too.

00:22:36.981 --> 00:22:37.940
[horn honking]

00:22:37.982 --> 00:22:41.026
Ah. I have to get going.

00:22:41.068 --> 00:22:42.486
[MIZUHO] Aww. You're
not gonna have any fun

00:22:42.528 --> 00:22:44.947
with that bus full of stiffs.

00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:47.408
[KOSSETSU]
Well, yeah.

00:22:47.449 --> 00:22:49.118
I‐I know, but...

00:22:49.159 --> 00:22:51.245
[honking]

00:22:51.287 --> 00:22:52.454
[KOSSETSU]
They're waiting.

00:22:52.496 --> 00:22:54.790
Nozomi, I'll be in touch.

00:22:54.832 --> 00:22:56.500
[NOZOMI]
See yah!

00:22:56.542 --> 00:22:58.294
Bye‐bye.

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:03.090
[ASAKAZE sighs]

00:23:08.095 --> 00:23:11.223
[NAGARA] All that's left
is a gaping hole, huh?
