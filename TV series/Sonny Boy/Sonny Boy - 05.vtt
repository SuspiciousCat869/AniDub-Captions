00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:19.811
Poor mice... getting eaten...

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:22.689
If you want,
I'll take care of the bad guys,

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:23.774
you just keep the
mice from get‐‐

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:25.442
You really shouldn't.

00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:26.568
And why not?

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.154
'Cause everything would collapse
and none of them would survive.

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:30.864
Which wouldn't
accomplish anything.

00:00:30.906 --> 00:00:32.199
Let's be smart.

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:35.661
We have to figure this world out
and overcome it the right way.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.247
Otherwise, we're not
gonna get that reward.

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:39.915
Mrowr.

00:00:39.957 --> 00:00:41.166
Tch.

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:45.754
[MOUSE 05A]
Chu!

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.174
[NAGARA]
Nozomi!

00:00:57.683 --> 00:00:58.684
[NAGARA]
You hurt?

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:01.186
No, I'm fine. Thanks, though.

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:02.688
Is there really a point
in us trying to

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.606
"conquer" these worlds?

00:01:04.648 --> 00:01:06.191
Well, don't ask me.

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:07.985
[ASAKAZE]
This one's a lost cause anyway.

00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:10.320
We won't know that
unless we try.

00:01:32.843 --> 00:01:34.970
[NAGARA]
Right... I'm done...

00:01:35.012 --> 00:01:36.346
Are you okay?

00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:38.557
Here, have some of this.

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:40.058
[NOZOMI] He made it to
a few of the worlds

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.476
we were aiming for, didn't he?

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:42.686
[gasps]

00:01:42.728 --> 00:01:45.480
[RAJDHANI] Hmm. That's true
but it feels like he stumbled

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:46.982
into them by total chance.

00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:49.151
[ASAKAZE] You're a
luck‐of‐the‐draw gacha machine.

00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:52.863
You'll hit the jackpot sometime,
just gotta keep trying.

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:57.075
[NOZOMI] Hmm. Somehow, I doubt
it's gonna be as simple as that.

00:01:58.827 --> 00:01:59.786
[NAGARA]
Sorry.

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:01.913
[RAJDHANI]
Hmm? No need to apologize.

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:03.123
Failures help, too.

00:02:03.165 --> 00:02:05.250
They inch us that much
closer to success.

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:08.629
Exactly! We've got as
much time as we need here.

00:02:10.714 --> 00:02:12.883
[ASAKAZE] I don't know why
you're acting so confident.

00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:14.843
We don't know anything for sure.

00:02:16.053 --> 00:02:17.596
[RAJDHANI]
You're right about that.

00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:20.515
But taking a chance
is our only option.

00:02:20.557 --> 00:02:23.644
We've got a beacon to our
original world and a means

00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:24.978
of moving ourselves there.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.272
We need something
that connects them.

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:29.941
Whether it'll be someone's
power, or this world,

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:33.445
I can't be sure,
but another piece is necessary.

00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:35.656
Luckily, we've found
items that carry

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:37.157
their own powers with them.

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:40.285
[NOZOMI] Mm‐hmm. And the light
is closer, too.

00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:42.120
More so than yesterday.

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:44.581
[NOZOMI]
Okay.

00:02:44.623 --> 00:02:47.042
Let's set these mice free
from this world.

00:02:47.084 --> 00:02:48.585
[GROUP]
Mm.

00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:52.214
[NOZOMI] It's not that this
place is a lost cause.

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:54.716
We just have to save
the rebellious red mouse,

00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:57.719
and change the way
things work here.

00:02:57.761 --> 00:02:59.846
No more dying over gold.

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:02.808
It'll at least be a better
place than it was before.

00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:16.279
[MOUSE 05A]
Chu, chu, chu, chu!

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:20.117
[NOZOMI] The great mouse
relocation operation!

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:21.451
[NAGARA grunts]

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.506
[NAGARA] Did that "conquer"
the world, then?

00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:37.467
[NOZOMI] You've gotten better
at using your super‐power.

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:39.386
[NAGARA]
Huh...? Really?

00:03:39.428 --> 00:03:40.971
I don't think
anything's changed.

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:43.598
[NOZOMI] Come on.
You've grown a ton!

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.852
I've been watching you improve.
We'll get home in no time!

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:49.229
[NAGARA] Mm. Now you're
just exaggerating.

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:53.775
[NAGARA] Plus, remember
what Ms. Aki said?

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:56.403
You know, how we can't ever...

00:03:56.445 --> 00:03:58.780
[NOZOMI]
Oh, don't listen to her.

00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:01.408
One time, a doctor gave
me some friendly advice.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.702
"Never ever, in a million years,
should you trust the word

00:04:03.744 --> 00:04:06.121
of a well‐endowed

00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:08.039
'Cause the nutrition goes
straight to her boobs instea‐‐

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.625
Uh, yeah, I get it‐‐
no need to clarify.

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:12.544
[NOZOMI]
Ha! Why're you blushing?

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:14.045
[ASAKAZE growls]

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:21.303
[MIZUHO] Hey, do you think
this is this world's reward?

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:23.597
[NOZOMI, NAGARA]
Hmm?

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:25.474
[MOUSE]
Chu, chu, chu, chu!

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:26.641
[NOZOMI]
Hmm...

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:29.561
[MIZUHO]
Huh...?

00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:30.562
[NOZOMI]
Weird...

00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:31.730
[NAGARA]
They came untied?

00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:33.565
‐‐[MOUSE] Chu! Chu!
‐‐What are you?

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:43.950
[NOTO] Don't you think Ms. Aki
was acting different than usual?

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:46.828
[SUWA] Yeah, she never talked
like that back in school.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.914
[KUJI]
She was a total cutie, huh?

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:51.082
Kinda like a reporter.

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:53.460
[DAIYA] But... after showing up
out of the blue and saying

00:04:53.502 --> 00:04:56.213
what she did, I don't
think we can trust her.

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:58.215
[ACE]
Hey. What are you saying?

00:04:58.256 --> 00:05:00.675
That Ms. Aki is tricking
us or something?

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:01.843
For what reason?

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:03.386
[STUDENTS gasping]

00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:04.805
[CAP groans]

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:08.225
None of you can ever go back to
your world again, understand?!

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:09.226
[gasping]

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:10.936
What are you talking about?

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:13.396
[STUDENTS murmuring]

00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:15.232
[NOTO]
You're not here to rescue us?!

00:05:15.273 --> 00:05:17.484
Then what are you here for?!

00:05:17.526 --> 00:05:19.027
[AKI]
Shut up and listen!

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:20.028
[STUDENTS gasping]

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.031
This was never about going home
in the first place, was it?

00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:24.241
What does that mean?

00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:25.700
[AKI] There are those
among you who could

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:28.703
use your powers before.
And by before,

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:31.248
I mean back when you were
all still in school.

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.542
[gasping]

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:36.461
[AKI] Which means this
whole "going adrift" thing

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:40.215
might be the result of
somebody misusing their power!

00:05:40.257 --> 00:05:43.885
Okay. Then can we ask
how you made your way here?

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:46.805
[AKI] Hah! Good question,
for a piece of trash.

00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:48.014
[gasps]

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:50.559
I'll tell you, so listen up.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.312
Because God needed me to!
That's why!

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:56.356
[ASAMA] All right, but...
were there really people

00:05:56.398 --> 00:05:58.984
who could use their powers
before we ever came here?

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:00.610
[STUDENTS groaning]

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:03.780
When she said that, it kinda got
me thinking about some stuff.

00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:04.906
[gasping]

00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:07.158
[SUWA] Remember the
weirdness at school?

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.245
The three billion yen coming out
of lockers and the auroras

00:06:10.287 --> 00:06:12.163
on school grounds?

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:15.250
Looking back, couldn't those
incidents have been the result

00:06:15.292 --> 00:06:17.669
of someone using their
super‐power in secret?

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:21.131
Then do you think everything
the teacher told us was true?

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:23.466
[MUTSU] If someone's power
is what brought us here.

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:25.343
there's only one candidate.

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.304
[STUDENTS gasping]

00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:30.557

even bring this up, but...

[MACHI]
What?

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:32.767
[KAGA]
I dunno...

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:34.978
Let's go, pal. Spit it out.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.273
M‐Maybe, well, i‐it's possible
that he's lying and pretending

00:06:38.315 --> 00:06:40.108
he can't go back home.

[STUDENTS murmuring]

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:42.819
[NOTO]
What would be the point?

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:44.696
[BOY 05B]
Is he for real?

00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:47.490

Quiet, everyone. Settle down.

I'm gonna kill that guy!

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:55.707
[HOSHI] Now, now;
let's just take it easy.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.793
[RAJDHANI] It's not possible
Nagara's pretending

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:00.003
that we can't go home.

00:07:00.045 --> 00:07:01.129
And why is that?!

00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:03.882
If he was trying to trick
everyone, then he wouldn't go

00:07:03.924 --> 00:07:05.592
to any other worlds at all.

00:07:05.634 --> 00:07:06.676
[HOSHI]
That's right.

00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:09.512
Plus, how can you suspect
one of your classmates?

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:11.389
That goes against
our school motto!

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:14.267
We're all supposed "To live
together," if you recall?

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:16.436
[STUDENTS groaning]

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:25.904

Tch.

00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:33.078
[AKI]
You made this, right?

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:35.372
For everybody else?

00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:36.414
What do you mean?

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:40.043
Don't be so grumpy.
I'm complimenting you.

00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:42.754
[ASAKAZE] Whatever.
It's not that big a deal.

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:44.005

Why not?

00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:45.590
[ASAKAZE]
"Why not"?

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:48.551
'Cause there are lots of
talented people out there.

And I don't just mean
in this world‐‐

That's where you're wrong, kid.
Just think about it.

This hole is the only reason
the island hasn't sunk.

You're not like the others.
You're special.

No. You're just saying that.

[AKI] Poor boy.
Nobody really understands.

Not even you.

Hey, this kinda hurts!

[AKI]
You are somebody special.

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:18.873
You don't have to be
bound by this world.

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:20.959
The time is approaching.

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:24.212
You are going to evolve.
It's something...

00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:26.131
...that only you can do.

Power holdovers?

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.453
[RAJDHANI] Yeah, at some point,
the name just stuck.

00:08:56.494 --> 00:08:57.454
Don't ask me.

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:59.956
Anyway, over time they
obtained these by conquering

00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:01.583
other this worlds.

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:03.835
And they all have powers,
like your mouse there.

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:07.881
Oh! So, the others
already knew about them.

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:09.507
[MIZUHO]
What do these things do?

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:12.177
[gasps]

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.471
They're known as
the Go‐Old Glasses.

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:17.182
They let you see what people
will look like when they're old.

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:18.850
[MIZUHO gasps]

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:20.310
[whimpers]

00:09:20.351 --> 00:09:22.896
[NAGARA]
Hmm? Is something wrong?

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:24.606
[MIZUHO]
No...

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:26.941
[RAJDHANI] I gotta say,
I never expected we'd discover

00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:28.401
‐‐a power like this.
‐‐[ARMSTRONG] Chu?

00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:30.987
[RAJDHANI] We might be closer
to finding our missing piece

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:31.988
than we thought.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.699
And when we do, you better
be ready to use your ability.

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:36.117
[NAGARA]
Uh. Okay.

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:37.994
[MIZUHO]
Thanks, "mister savior!"

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:39.579
[NAGARA sighs]
Cut that out.

00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:40.955
The best, baldest,

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:42.457
‐‐toothless, wrinkled geezer!
‐‐Hey, Nagara,

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:43.583
you should know.

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:45.043
[NAGARA]
Huh? Know what?

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:49.214
Well... I'm sorry, but to all
the others at the moment...

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:50.840
...you aren't a savior.

00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:52.967
You're pretty much the opposite.

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:54.719
If anything, they think‐‐

00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:57.597
‐‐[knocking]
‐‐[NAGARA] Hmm.

00:09:57.639 --> 00:10:01.142
[NOTO] Good evening!
Is Nagara here by chance?

00:10:03.228 --> 00:10:06.231
We wanted to have a word
with you. All right?

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:09.067
Ah? With me?

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:12.362
[NOZOMI] Huh? No, he's not
doing it on purpose.

00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:13.655
Nagara wouldn't do that.

00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:14.656
[INUYAMA]
Can you blame us?

00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:16.157
We're just trying
to be objective.

00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:18.118
[NOZOMI]
Would you listen to yourselves?

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:21.162
I know he has power, but you're
jumping to conclusions.

00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:23.373
[MACHI] Which is why
we asked him to come here.

00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:25.083
This is just a discussion.

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:27.919
We were hoping he could tell
the truth in front of everyone.

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:30.755
[ACE] Well, Nagara?
What's your answer?

00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:32.590
No. I'm innocent.

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:35.552
I'm not‐‐ I'm not the one
who did this.

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:36.886
[STUDENTS groaning]

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:39.514
[SUWA] Look. I don't know if
you're aware of this or not,

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:41.474
but...

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:43.726
We all have friends and
family that we left behind

00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:44.853
when we came here.

00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:47.480
Our parents must be
worried sick waiting for us,

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:49.816
and some of us have
entrance exams to take.

00:10:49.858 --> 00:10:52.402
‐‐Or clubs to run.
‐‐[TSUBAME sobbing]

00:10:52.443 --> 00:10:54.779
[DAIYA]
So we have to get back home.

00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:57.282
[gasps] Well, I'm not
trying to keep that from you!

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:59.868
[DAIYA] And unlike you,
the rest of us are needed

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:01.077
back in our world.

00:11:01.119 --> 00:11:02.287
[NOZOMI growls]

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:03.454
[SATA]
Say you're sorry!

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:04.455
[NOZOMI gasps]

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:06.082
[MIZUHO gasps]
What for?

00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:10.044
[KUJI] Yeah! Apologize for
messing up everyone's lives!

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:11.254
[NAGARA]
I... I'm sor‐‐

00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:12.672
[NOZOMI]
You've got no reason to be!

00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:14.424
[ACE] We're talking
to Nagara, not you!

00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:16.426
[NOZOMI]
This isn't a discussion!

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:18.511
Hell, you just want a scapegoat!

00:11:18.553 --> 00:11:21.389
Gonna blame him
so you feel better?!

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:23.349
[HOSHI] We're all being
rather unpleasant.

00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:25.810
We have been for some time.

00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:28.563
I think that perhaps we've let
Ms. Aki's words get to us,

00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:30.523
don't you?
And just think about it.

00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:33.067
We've come this far by
working together as a team.

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:34.611
Have you guys forgotten that?

00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:35.987
[STUDENTS sighing]

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:40.325
Yeah, I agree.
Hoshi's makin' a lotta sense.

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:43.369
Hey. where's everybody going?

00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:45.997
Sorry, but I think we've
all had just about enough

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:47.498
of his lectures.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.541
[HOSHI]
Oh?

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:51.419
Then you'd all rather listen
to Ms. Aki's lectures?

00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:55.423
Seems unwise‐‐she said we can
never go back to our own world.

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:57.508
You remember, right?

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.011
Despite invoking the name of
God as to how she appeared

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:04.140
in this world.
You don't find that strange?

00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:07.435
[AKI] Hmph. You still need
to finish your education.

00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:10.688
I guess I'll just have to be
the one to show you the way.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.191
[HOSHI] That isn't what
you really want, is it?

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:16.486
I mean, she offers no salvation.

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:20.114
[HOSHI]
She isn't anyone's savior.

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:24.160
[STUDENTS whimpering]

00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:28.248
Stop trying to get in our heads.
No one's getting saved.

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:30.875
Well, that's still
what'll happen.

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:33.253
[growls]

00:12:33.294 --> 00:12:34.754
Ah...

00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:55.108
[NAGARA sighs]

00:12:55.149 --> 00:12:57.026
[NOZOMI]
You gotta do it like I said.

00:12:57.068 --> 00:12:59.195
You're not gonna have
much luck if you don't.

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:00.446
[NAGARA]
I'm just not good at it.

00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:03.032
[NOZOMI] This has nothing
to do with talent.

00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:04.701
[NAGARA]
Yeah, guess you're right.

00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:07.370
No matter where I go,
or what power I have,

00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:09.622
I always end up useless.

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:14.419
[NAGARA] It's been that way
since I was born.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.297
[NOZOMI] So, you're just
gonna give up again?

00:13:17.338 --> 00:13:18.715
[NAGARA sighs]

00:13:18.756 --> 00:13:21.050
[glass shattering]

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:27.682
[NOZOMI] It's not like
people are worth anything

00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:29.726
just because they were born.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.105
[NOZOMI] That's why we have
to find our own purpose.

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:35.815
However long that takes.

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:40.445
Sure, there's some value in
the life we've been given,

00:13:40.486 --> 00:13:42.363
but if it came bundled
with a purpose,

00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:44.574
we'd be letting someone
else decide our fate,

00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:45.783
and that'd be gross.

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:48.119
[NAGARA sighs]
Mm.

00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:49.329
[NOZOMI]
Oh, look!

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:50.997
Guardian spirits!

00:13:53.207 --> 00:13:56.002
[NAGARA]
Whoa, wait‐‐ That's dangerous!

00:13:57.211 --> 00:13:58.838
[sighs]

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:07.096
[NOZOMI gasps]

00:14:07.138 --> 00:14:09.891
Nagara, come on!
It's incredible!

00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:12.477
Ah. Nah, I'm okay.

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:14.437
Come on, you'll be fine!

00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:17.732
Put on your mask and
get your butt down here!

00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:19.150
Hurry up, already!

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:22.111
[NAGARA]
Wha‐‐?!

00:14:52.975 --> 00:14:54.727
[NOZOMI gasps]
Wasn't that cool?

00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:56.229
I've never seen that before!

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.897
[NAGARA]
Yeah, it was!

00:14:57.939 --> 00:14:59.899
I wasn't expecting it to be
a school of minnows.

00:14:59.941 --> 00:15:02.276
[NOZOMI]
Right? Neither was I.

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:07.824
[NAGARA sighs]

00:15:07.865 --> 00:15:09.283
Thanks.

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:11.869
[NOZOMI]
Hmm?

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:13.371
Glad you came.

00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:15.039
Yeah.

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:17.959
But man... I'm impressed you
could just dive right in.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.419
You're just too chicken for it.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.712
Well, maybe you're
just too reckless.

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:27.510
Don't you... ever get... scared?

00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:30.263
[NOZOMI] Sure do.
Scared and anxious.

00:15:30.304 --> 00:15:33.599
[gasps]
Then how...?

00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:37.728
To be honest,
it's why I do stuff like this.

00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:49.657
[AKI giggles]

00:15:49.699 --> 00:15:52.243
What do we do now that
we're all split up?

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:53.828
[HOSHI]
Don't worry.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.580
We're ready for this.

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:58.082
We already know
what's happening.

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:08.509
[AKI]
Running away again?

00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:09.510
[gasps]

00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:10.678
[AKI]
Don't play dumb.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.555
Your ability is "Escape,"

00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:14.557
which is the power to run away.

00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:16.976
You didn't wanna be in your old
world anymore and that wish

00:16:17.018 --> 00:16:19.687
sucked everybody into this one.

00:16:19.729 --> 00:16:20.813
Stop it.

00:16:20.855 --> 00:16:21.814
That isn't true.

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:23.232
[AKI]
Yes, it is!

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:26.360
And since your power is made for
running, it's one‐way isn't it?!

00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:28.279
Which means that
you can't return!

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:30.198
All of you are gonna be
stuck tagging along

00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:32.825

escapist fantasy forever.

Quit making us suffer, 'cause we
don't want to come with you!

No, it's not like that.

This is fun for you, isn't it?

00:16:50.718 --> 00:16:52.094
[NAGARA]
Huh?

00:16:52.136 --> 00:16:54.680
[KAGA] You just happened
to gain an incredible power

00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:57.266
and now you've got
girls being nice to you.

00:16:57.308 --> 00:17:01.229
Meanwhile, you were all but
nonexistent back in our world.

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:04.857
[sighs] Whatever.
I don't care if I go back.

00:17:04.899 --> 00:17:07.360
And I don't really care
what happens to you guys.

00:17:07.401 --> 00:17:09.320
I dare you to say that again.

You always act like this!

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.540
You just pretend to give up,

hoping for something to change!

Thanks for these.

00:17:38.182 --> 00:17:41.269
Rajdhani, do you believe
in God? I'm curious.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:44.355
[RAJDHANI]
Hmm? Oh, not so much God,

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:47.358
but I do have my
own kind of faith.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.820
[MIZUHO] Yeah? 'Cause I've heard
His voice speaking to me.

00:17:50.861 --> 00:17:51.946
"His" as in...?

00:17:51.988 --> 00:17:54.574
[MIZUHO] God. He told
me that I was the one

00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:56.325
who caused us to go adrift.

00:17:56.367 --> 00:17:57.994
[RAJDHANI]
Hmm...

00:17:58.035 --> 00:18:00.496
My power's so strange.

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:02.290
What is it really?

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:06.794
[MACHI panting]

00:18:09.547 --> 00:18:11.215
[MACHI gasps]
Found you!

00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:14.844
[NOZOMI]
Hmm? Hey, you're just in time.

00:18:14.885 --> 00:18:16.137
Need some fish?

00:18:16.178 --> 00:18:17.972
[thunder cracks]

00:18:18.014 --> 00:18:19.724
[BOTH gasp]

00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:27.440
[NOZOMI] No matter
what the others say,

00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:30.860
the way I see you
won't change, Nagara.

00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:36.866
[NAGARA sobbing]

00:18:38.868 --> 00:18:40.286
[NAGARA]
I really do...

00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:43.247
[sobbing]

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:44.915
I want to go back...

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:48.044
[sobs]
I wanna go back home, too...

00:18:48.085 --> 00:18:49.545
[VOICE]
Stand up.

00:18:52.757 --> 00:18:54.550
[VOICE]
There's still time.

00:18:57.845 --> 00:19:01.140
That's it? We really can't
ever go back home?

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:02.141
[AKI]
Give it up.

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:04.477
Wait a sec. we came
back from those worlds

00:19:04.518 --> 00:19:06.270
connected to
the school, didn't we?

00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:08.981
[AKI] Sure, but this world
and your own world

00:19:09.023 --> 00:19:10.608
are two completely
different things.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.401
[KOSSETSU]
What about that girl Nozomi?

00:19:12.443 --> 00:19:14.445
She says she can see
the way out to our world.

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:19.116
[AKI] She's lying. You're better
off accepting the truth now.

00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:22.161
But you know what? There may
be hope left for you yet.

00:19:22.203 --> 00:19:23.162
[gasping]

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:25.122
In that boy.

00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:28.125
The guardian who
protects this world.

00:19:38.427 --> 00:19:40.638
[STUDENTS gasping]

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.556
You're our savior!

00:19:50.564 --> 00:19:52.566
[NOZOMI]
What's up?

00:19:52.608 --> 00:19:53.567
You been crying?

00:19:53.609 --> 00:19:56.112
Why would I? No way.

00:19:56.153 --> 00:19:57.321
Okay?

00:19:59.657 --> 00:20:01.742
How did you get here?

00:20:01.784 --> 00:20:05.037
What do you care? You vanished
on us by choice, right?

00:20:05.079 --> 00:20:07.123
When we got word
that you'd disappeared,

00:20:07.164 --> 00:20:08.749
the three of started looking.

00:20:08.791 --> 00:20:11.335
We went through a whole lot
of trouble to make it here.

00:20:11.377 --> 00:20:14.004
If the student council
president hadn't lent us this,

00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:16.048
we'd never have found you.

00:20:21.095 --> 00:20:22.388
[BOTH]
Hmm?

00:20:24.473 --> 00:20:26.434
[STUDENTS cheering]

00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:28.394
Where's Nagara?

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:29.854
Don't ask me.

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:34.817
‐‐So why'd you run?
‐‐Huh?

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:38.487
[MIZUHO] Did you hear me?
I asked why you ran away.

00:20:38.529 --> 00:20:40.906
[NAGARA] Well, I couldn't
reason with them.

00:20:40.948 --> 00:20:42.324
I had no choice.

00:20:42.366 --> 00:20:44.076
What does that mean?!

00:20:44.118 --> 00:20:47.663
Me leaving... is what
they all wanted, so I did.

00:20:47.705 --> 00:20:49.874
[MIZUHO]
Oh, gimme a break!

00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:52.460
How can you throw yourself
a pity party, then turn around

00:20:52.501 --> 00:20:54.128
and scoff at everybody else?

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.046
Huh?! Screw you!

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:58.090
[gasps]
Leave me alone!

00:20:58.132 --> 00:21:01.093
Don't block out the truth
and try to fool yourself!

00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:02.219
The moment that you run away,

00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:05.014
you become the same kind
of idiot as the rest of them!

00:21:05.055 --> 00:21:06.432
[NAGARA]
I said leave me alone!

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:08.601
This is why people
think you're hopeless.

00:21:08.642 --> 00:21:10.728
So stupid!

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.063
[NAGARA grunts]
I know that.

00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:15.149
[MIZUHO]
You're not some cat.

00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:16.901
Don't go running off
without warning...

00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:18.944
‐‐Huh...?
‐‐[sobbing]

00:21:18.986 --> 00:21:22.198
[RAJDHANI] Hmm. We're really
glad that you're okay, man.

00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:25.117
Sorry.

00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:28.954
[NAGARA]
All right. No more running.

00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:32.166
[NOZOMI]
Good. Then let's go.

00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:34.794
[MIZUHO]
Tch. You are such a simpleton.

00:21:34.835 --> 00:21:38.047
[RAJDHANI] By the way,
this looks familiar, doesn't it?

00:21:38.088 --> 00:21:40.925
It reminds me of
the island before.

00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:42.593
Like, the one that burned?

00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:43.969
Hang on.

00:21:45.513 --> 00:21:47.973
[RAJDHANI] It's it, all right.
No doubt about it.

00:21:48.015 --> 00:21:50.392
This is the island we were on.

00:21:50.434 --> 00:21:51.894
But that's so strange...

00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:54.563
It'd have to mean
there are two islands.

00:21:55.397 --> 00:21:57.358
Oh! Maybe there are.

00:21:57.399 --> 00:21:58.943
It's possible we've
been operating under

00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:01.487
a huge misunderstanding.

00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:11.372
[panting]

00:22:12.706 --> 00:22:14.708
[RAJDHANI]
Nagara's power is, shall we say,

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.001
a little different.

00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:18.504
We had assumed that
the charred island was restored

00:22:18.546 --> 00:22:20.673
through the use
of Asakaze's power.

00:22:20.714 --> 00:22:24.218
But that wasn't quite correct.
It was Nagara's ability.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.219
[gasping]

00:22:25.261 --> 00:22:26.971
But his power is teleporting.

00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:28.556
How could that have done it?

00:22:28.597 --> 00:22:31.892
[RAJDHANI] It's simple.
His power isn't teleporting.

00:22:31.934 --> 00:22:35.145
He's able to create whole
worlds out of thin air.

00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:38.399
He's likely done this for
every new world we've gone to.

00:22:43.612 --> 00:22:46.782
[NOZOMI]
Oh! What an incredible view.

00:22:48.284 --> 00:22:52.037
[NOZOMI] Heh! So close,
the light's right nearby!

00:22:59.086 --> 00:23:01.088
[ASAKAZE]
That was an awful world.

00:23:02.339 --> 00:23:04.633
[ASAKAZE]
No one was nice to me.

00:23:04.675 --> 00:23:06.510
[AKI]
Do you want to change the world?

00:23:06.552 --> 00:23:08.053
[ASAKAZE gasps]

00:23:08.095 --> 00:23:10.556
Would you like
to come along with me?

00:23:13.267 --> 00:23:14.268
[ASAKAZE]
Hmm.
