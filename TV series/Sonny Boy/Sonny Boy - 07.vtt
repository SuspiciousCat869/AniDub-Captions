00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.384
[GROUP PRESIDENT 07A]
Like bubbles boiling up to

00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:13.138
the surface, new "These Worlds"
are being born every day!

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.390
We have corroboration
via the observation

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:17.935
of multiple instances
of This Worlds!

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:21.522
Scholars have long predicted
the emergence of the "observer."

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:24.441
The one who has spawned
these new worlds!

00:00:24.483 --> 00:00:26.944
At last, this observer
has been found!

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:29.446
And we now know that the
drifting we've experienced

00:00:29.488 --> 00:00:31.114
was caused by this
"Nagara" person.

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:32.115
[VICTIM 07A]
That's the guy?!

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:35.577
Because of him, our futures have
been stolen and we were thrust

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:37.496
into the cruel absurdity
of "This World!"

00:00:37.538 --> 00:00:38.622
[VICTIM 07B]
Where the hell is he?!

00:00:38.664 --> 00:00:41.375
[VICTIM 07C] Let's him
crucify him, and burn alive!

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:43.835
He is guilty of a serious crime.

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:46.922
And now, in accordance with
our rules, we will condemn him

00:00:46.964 --> 00:00:48.549
to the fullest extent!

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.802
The tragedy that is to come
must be prevented!

00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:55.097
[KOUMORI] I can't wait to see
what sort of judgment they pass.

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:57.307
[GROUP PRESIDENT 07A] We will
dispatch Koumori the Convictor,

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:58.684
from Beatnik.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:02.521
No doubt, we can trust him to
hand down the proper sentence.

00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:09.194
[AKI]
Problem?

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:11.572
[ASAKAZE]
Just go on without me, please.

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:13.740
[AKI]
Why? Forget something?

00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:15.701
No, it's just that...

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.703
...I gotta tie up loose ends.

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:19.830
I see.

00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:21.582
So what are we gonna do now?

00:01:21.623 --> 00:01:23.625
Stick with Hoshi, or what?

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:26.795
Nothing we can do.
We've got nowhere to go now.

00:01:26.837 --> 00:01:28.130
We're so done.

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:31.216
And now graduation is over.

00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:34.595
Gotta make our own choices
from here on out.

00:01:39.975 --> 00:01:41.059
[MIZUHO]
Wow.

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:43.937
That thing can really go to
another "This World?"

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.606
I hope you don't
want to go aboard,

00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:47.649
'cause you were
specifically not invited.

00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:49.568
Well, isn't that a real shame.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.819
[MACHI]
Hmm.

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:55.032
[MIZUHO] So, tell me‐‐there are
some other castaways who travel

00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:57.659
to and from other
worlds, aren't there?

00:01:57.701 --> 00:02:00.704
[YAMABIKO] Yeah, using
power holdovers or loopholes

00:02:00.746 --> 00:02:04.041
in the different worlds.
Kinda like you guys do it.

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:07.461
Huh. I thought it
would be a lot harder.

00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:11.423
Well, it may seem easy to you,
but going to other "This Worlds"

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:14.217
used to be impossible,
least that's what we thought

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:17.512
for thousands of years
before it finally happened.

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:21.516
Huh? It really took thousands
of years to pull it off?

00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:23.769
Immortality must get dull.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.022
I can't help but wonder what the
other castaways must be like.

00:02:27.064 --> 00:02:29.858
I just hope they're all
not as crappy as Ms. Aki.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.903
That stupid fake teacher needs
to give up the act already.

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:34.780
She had us fooled for a while.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.740
Who knew she was one of us?

00:02:36.782 --> 00:02:39.826
Crazy to think we all came
from the same school.

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:42.412
[YAMABIKO] There are all
sorts of people out there.

00:02:42.454 --> 00:02:46.249
But you have the powers
of the universe.

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:49.670
I believe that ship
will keep everybody safe.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.677
[MIZUHO]
So whatcha reading?

00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:58.929
Oh, "Robinson Crusoe," huh?

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.389
[NAGARA]
Give it back.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.932
Oh, come on.
I'm willing to bet

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:05.102
that Raj needs your help with
whatever project he's got.

00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:07.604
Well?

00:03:07.646 --> 00:03:09.231
Nice, oh yeah.
Now, we're talkin'.

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:10.649
You're pretty into whatever it‐‐
[gasps]

00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:13.402
Yep, taking the easiest route,
just like I thought.

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:15.195
[NAGARA gasps]
What are you doing?

00:03:15.237 --> 00:03:16.905
[RAJDHANI]
I'm observing!

00:03:16.947 --> 00:03:20.367
It's actually entertaining,
watchin' em go place to place.

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.912
Up, down, who cares?
They go where they want.

00:03:23.954 --> 00:03:26.456
But what do you think they
ultimately end up doing?

00:03:26.498 --> 00:03:28.208
Um, I have no idea.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.168
They start to feast
on each other.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.003
Until there's only one left.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:35.382
Really makes you wonder, huh?
What if we were all in a situa‐‐

00:03:35.424 --> 00:03:37.801
Oh! What the hell
are you doing?!

00:03:37.843 --> 00:03:38.802
[NAGARA]
I'm setting them free!

00:03:38.844 --> 00:03:40.429
[RAJDHANI]
They're fine! And besides,

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.180
I'm still watching them,
you know?!

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.683
[gasps]
Ah...

00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:46.852
How could he do this to me?!

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:47.936
[sobbing]

00:03:47.978 --> 00:03:51.690
Hey, looks like there's
something up on your screen.

00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:53.483
[RAJDHANI] I was having
a good time with that...

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:54.985
[NOZOMI]
Let's give him some space.

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:57.529
[RAJDHANI]
That was my colony...!

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:01.700
[NAGARA panting]

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.337
[YAMABIKO] Nagara, it's true
that the drifting happened

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.798
because of your power.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.550
But you really don't need
to feel responsible

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:22.679
for it, per se. You didn't
choose it, after all‐‐

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.890
God gave you
this special ability.

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:27.726
You didn't even realize
you were doing anything.

00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:29.394
You were used.

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.647
[gasps]

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.107
[grunting]

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:37.944
[NAGARA]
Is that a bat?

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:41.615
Weird, why is there
an exercise bar out here?

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:51.917
[NAGARA grunting]

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.545
[NAGARA]
Uh? Huh?

00:04:55.587 --> 00:05:00.175
[screams]

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:04.012
[VOICE]
Hey, buddy, stand up, would ya?

00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:06.431
[NAGARA groans]

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:09.100
Hurry up.
Or else they'll see ya.

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:11.812
Who're you?

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:13.063
[grunts]

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:15.857
Hey! State your number!

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:17.859
[NAGARA]
What the‐‐?

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:20.195
I told you to state
your damn number!

00:05:20.237 --> 00:05:22.322
3‐B, number 25.

00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:23.990
Hey, group 3‐B!

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:25.659
Here! Right now!

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.244
[WORKERS grunting]

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.457
[FOREMAN 07A]
Your little friend, number 25,

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:34.334
has some kind of
problem with work!

00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:37.754
So I'm upping your quota:
another 50 kilos a day,

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:40.173
which means you guys
owe me 800!

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:42.300
Got a problem with that?!
Take it up with him!

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:45.011
Dismissed!
Now get back to work!

00:05:46.555 --> 00:05:47.889
[grunts]

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:49.766
[FUTATSUBOSHI]
It's actually a simple job.

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:51.518
You grab the blocks that
get brought from the top

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.811
and carry them down.

00:05:52.853 --> 00:05:54.938
Nothin' else to it.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.482
[NAGARA]
Huh? Okay?

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.363
What is going on?

00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:04.990
[WORKER 07F]
Hey! Get movin'!

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:05.991
Of course!

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:07.325
I'm sorry...

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:12.956
I should be getting back.

00:06:12.998 --> 00:06:14.374
[WORKER 07D]
Hey, you guys hear?

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:17.586
They finally found the dude
who started all the drifting.

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:20.171
[WORKER 07D] Supposedly,
his name's "Nagara" something.

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:22.007
Beatnik figured out
he's the one behind it.

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:24.009
This is all because of him!

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.303
Man, if it weren't for that guy,
we wouldn't be stuck

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:28.471
in this miserable hellhole.

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:30.932
Yeah, what?!

00:06:30.974 --> 00:06:32.434
Is this seat taken?

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:34.603
Um, no, it's all yours.

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:36.563
Futatsuboshi's the name.

00:06:36.605 --> 00:06:37.772
And you are?

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:40.984
Oh, Naga... ta.

00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:44.070
[FUTATSUBOSHI] That was
a hairy situation, Nagata.

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:47.240
Oh, yeah. Thanks
for helping me out.

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:48.325
Well, don't sweat it, bud.

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:50.702
You don't owe me any
thanks or anything.

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:53.538
Seeing you like that reminded me
of when I was the new kid.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.041
My instincts took over
and I just stepped in.

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:58.585
Really, nothin' else to it.

00:06:58.627 --> 00:07:02.756
So are you... a student
from Shiraito Middle School #2?

00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:05.467
Seriously? You really
don't know nothing, huh?

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:07.677
Bet you're a novice
castaway, aren't ya?

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:08.762
A novice?

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:10.680
[FUTATSUBOSHI]
Yeah! I mean, we're all students

00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:13.099
of Shiraito Middle School #2.

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:14.476
It's been a hell of
a long time since

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:16.519
we were middle‐
schoolers, though.

00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:20.857
These days, I guess you could
say we're "tower builders."

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:22.150
Nothin' else to it.

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:23.652
But why do that?

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:25.445
We're tryin' to
get up to Heaven.

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:26.446
Really?

00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:28.114
Heaven is the only way
outta this place,

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:29.532
and back to our own world.

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:31.618
Oh, yeah? You believe that?

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.120
Yeah, of course!
But it's more than that‐‐

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:36.414
We're hunting for
treasure in the meantime.

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:37.999
Yep. Nothin' else to it.

00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:42.087
So... Heaven is the way out,
and there's treasure?

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:44.005
What's the main
objective, though?

00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:46.883
Well, both of 'em, yep.

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:51.179
[FUTATSUBOSHI]
Okay, this is it.

00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:54.015
Closest thing we got
to a five star hotel.

00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:55.058
[WORKERS snoring]

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.184
I'm sorry.

00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:58.353
‐‐[FUTATSUBOSHI] Uh?
‐‐Uh, never mind.

00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:00.397
[FUTATSUBOSHI]
Ah. Nighty‐night.

00:08:03.108 --> 00:08:04.943
[NAGARA grunts]

00:08:07.988 --> 00:08:09.656
[NAGARA sighs]

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:11.783
Huh?

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:14.285
[SUSUGASHIRA]
Not happening...

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:15.537
[SUSUGASHIRA] Your power
is never going to work

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:17.747
in this place.

00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:20.208
That was my decision,
by the way.

00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:27.674
[NAGARA grunting]

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:30.301
[NAGARA grunts]

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:35.557
[NAGARA] I've been
wondering about something‐‐

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:37.726
why are we carrying
the blocks down?

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:38.727
[FUTATSUBOSHI]
Huh?

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:41.730
I mean, the whole idea
is to build a tower, right?

00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:44.441
It would make more sense to me
if were to carry 'em up.

00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:47.444
Yeah. that's just
the way it is, I guess.

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:48.611
They're probably
just trying to build up

00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:50.905
the foundation or something.

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:54.075
"Or something"? You don't know?

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:56.578
Well, do you know when
the tower'll be finished?

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:59.289
[FUTATSUBOSHI] You like to ask a
lotta funny questions, don't ya?

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.625
I've been here about 200 years
already and never once

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:04.544
have I ever wanted to know that.

00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:06.463
Whoa, you've been
here that long?

00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:09.591
Aw, 200 years is nothin'
compared to some guys.

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:12.177
Got veterans who've
put in over a thousand.

00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:16.389
‐‐Huh?
‐‐[FOREMAN 07A] Yes, sir!

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:17.932
Sorry, sir!

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:19.768
[NAGARA]
Who's that guy?

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:21.561
That's Susugashira.

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:25.231
Big shot who's the host here,
he's also a part of Beatnik.

00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:27.150
[NAGARA] I don't know
what any of that means.

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:29.152
Well. A host is like a boss‐‐

00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:31.696
they run their own world
pretty much.

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:34.657
As for Beatnik, they're whatcha
might call a "dream team."

00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:36.242
Basically, it's
a buncha elites‐‐

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:38.286
they come from all
the different worlds.

00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:39.871
They travel back
and forth between 'em,

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:41.956
takin' various active roles.

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:43.541
Right now, they're
focused on figuring out

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:44.959
what caused the driftin'.

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:46.169
[NAGARA grunts]

00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:47.462
Ah!

00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:49.589
[shrill whistle blows]

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:50.882
What the‐‐?!

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:52.050
Ah. Whoops.

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:54.135
I've never seen one of 'em
fall like that before,

00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:55.845
other than one of
mine, of course.

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:56.971
Oh, boy.

00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:58.431
It's you!

00:09:58.473 --> 00:09:59.849
[NAGARA]
Uh...

00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:05.105
[NAGARA]
What's this?

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:06.856
Payment for a hard week's work!

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:08.650
So this is how we're paid?

00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:10.944
Say, Nagata, let's go party!

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:13.363
And the tab's gonna
be on me, friend!

00:10:13.404 --> 00:10:16.366
[CROWD murmuring]

00:10:16.407 --> 00:10:17.534
[FUTATSUBOSHI]
Terrible!

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:19.702
This guy needs to have
his head kicked in!

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:20.912
Nothin' else to it.

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:22.455
Yeah, you're tellin' me.

00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:25.500
I'm a pretty peaceful guy,
but I'd love to do it myself.

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:27.252
Sending everybody adrift.

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:29.754
He can't just get
away with that crap.

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:31.548
Hypothetically...

00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:32.841
[FUTATSUBOSHI]
Hmm?

00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:36.845
What would you say? Like,
if this Nagara guy was me?

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:39.222
Oh, that's rich!

00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:42.183
The guy's a monster‐‐there's
no way it could be you, buddy!

00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:44.227
You and I are kindred
spirits and I'm a pretty good

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:46.312
‐‐judge of character, to boot.
‐‐[NAGARA sighs]

00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:48.314
Hello! You new?

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:50.567
Oh, yeah! One of my guys.

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:51.943
The new kid.

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:53.319
[HIME]
Here ya go!

00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:57.448
‐‐[NAGARA] Uh?
‐‐Hey, so tell me somethin'‐‐

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.742
Have you ever heard about
the shooting star legend?

00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:01.870
Uh. No‐‐ Ah!

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:06.374
[HIME] Somewhere in the tower,
there's supposed to be a room

00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:10.295
that shooting stars fall into.
So romantic, ain't it?

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:12.547
Oh, yeah! It's lovely stuff!

00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:15.758
If I ever catch myself
one of those shooting stars,

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.345
I'm gonna wish for a handsome
husband up in Heaven, yep!

00:11:19.387 --> 00:11:21.264
All mine!
[giggles]

00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:24.184
[FUTATSUBOSHI] Hmm.
I'm sure you'll find someone.

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:28.605
[SUSUGASHIRA] Seems Nagara's
starting to get pretty settled

00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:30.064
into this world.

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:33.484
There's no sign of him
knowing what Babel really is.

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:35.486
Not yet, anyway.

00:11:41.993 --> 00:11:43.995
[FUTATSUBOSHI]
What's wrong? Trouble sleepin'?

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:45.747
Um. Yeah.

00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:49.000
Well, you wanna go searching
for shooting stars with me?

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:50.835
What? Right now?

00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:55.215
[panting]
I'm so tired...

00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:56.716
Can we take a break?

00:11:56.758 --> 00:11:58.343
[FUTATSUBOSHI]
You're already pooped from that?

00:11:58.384 --> 00:11:59.802
[NAGARA]
Yeah, I'm done.

00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:01.512
[grunts]

00:12:04.015 --> 00:12:07.477
[NAGARA sighs]
Can't believe I'm doing this.

00:12:07.518 --> 00:12:10.897
Caught up in some
silly urban legend.

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:13.608
[FUTATSUBOSHI] Don't worry,
you don't have to find anything.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:14.609
[NAGARA]
Huh?

00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:17.362
The most important thing is that
you went out looking for it.

00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:18.988
Nothin' else to it.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.283
I'm sure this is
gonna tickle ol' Hime.

00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:23.910
Do you think she
seriously believes in

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:25.286
all this nonsense?

00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:28.122
There's nothin' wrong with it.
Ya gotta believe in somethin',

00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:31.042
even if is just
a big buncha nonsense.

00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:34.545
'Cause the option, is not
believin' in anything instead.

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:36.506
Nothin' else to it.

00:12:36.547 --> 00:12:39.550
Huh. Guess you
caught your breath?

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:42.512
[NAGARA] I'm heading back.
We start early tomorrow.

00:12:42.553 --> 00:12:44.597
[FUTATSUBOSHI]
Okay.

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:47.183
Ya know, it's kinda the same
as building the tower.

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:49.686
[FUTATSUBOSHI] I don't think
there are any castaways

00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:53.314
that really believe we're
gonna get to Heaven someday.

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.402
What's that look about?

00:12:57.443 --> 00:12:59.779
[NAGARA]
That's just not funny, is all.

00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:02.657
No, 'cause it's the truth.

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:04.784
So why are we doing
any of this, then?

00:13:04.826 --> 00:13:06.494
'Cause there's nothin' else?

00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:09.455
I'm just a lowly
little worker ant, buddy.

00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:12.125
Even if it's all just BS,
I'm happier chasin' after

00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:14.335
that tiny glimmer of hope.

00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:16.170
Nothin' else to it.

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:18.006
Well, not me!

00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:20.466
Uh, sorry, man.

00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:23.177
Oh. Maybe this'll
raise your spirits a bit.

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:25.388
A gift, from me to you.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.389
Take it.

00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:29.350
Uh, where did you... Um...
[gulps]

00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:30.893
Well, if you don't
want it, I can‐‐

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:32.270
No, I‐‐

00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:38.401
[NAGARA]
There it is!

00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:39.610
Thank God!

00:13:41.904 --> 00:13:43.573
[NAGARA]
Ah, it's so good!

00:13:43.614 --> 00:13:47.160
No, nevermind,
it's disgusting... So gross...

00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:50.747
[sobbing]

00:13:50.788 --> 00:13:51.873
What the‐‐?

00:13:51.914 --> 00:13:53.708
Shooting stars!

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:57.670
‐‐[NAGARA] Huh...?
‐‐Whoa! They're really here!

00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:01.424
[FUTATSUBOSHI]
Amazin', isn't it?

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:05.053
[NAGARA gasps]
No, wait‐‐

00:14:05.094 --> 00:14:06.512
[RAJDHANI]
Pretty, huh?

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:10.058
These little guys emit light
in the darkness of the caves.

00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:11.893
[RAJDHANI]
You wanna know why?

00:14:11.934 --> 00:14:13.227
[NAGARA]
Yeah, sure.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:15.897
So they can lure other bugs
in with the pretty lights.

00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:18.107
then hook them with
the slime tendrils.

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:19.984
Amazing, isn't it?

00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:20.985
It's a trap!

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:22.153
Get out!

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:23.154
[FUTATSUBOSHI]
Huh...?

00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:25.490
Uh... Ah... Ah...

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:26.949
Ah!

Hey, Nagara!

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:44.175
Where'd you go?

00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:46.761
Stop hiding and
come out, would ya?

00:14:46.803 --> 00:14:50.014
He shouldn't have gone
too far just to free some ants.

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:52.141
[gasps]
Hey! That way!

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:53.393
[RAJDHANI]
Huh?

00:14:53.434 --> 00:14:54.435
You hear me?!

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:56.104
[RAJDHANI]
This ant is...

00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:59.649
[MIZUHO] Yo! Listen,
Nagara's around here somewhere!

[WORKERS gasping]

00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:14.872
Oh. What's up, new guy?

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:16.457
By yourself today?

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:17.625
Yeah.

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:20.044
That's for you‐‐a gift.

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:21.838
[HIME]
Huh? Oh!

00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:24.132
That looks great!

00:15:24.173 --> 00:15:25.967
[HIME]
Mm. Mm!

00:15:26.008 --> 00:15:30.471
Ugh, what is this?! It's so bad!
Yuck, gonna make me sick!

00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:31.931
[coughs]

00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:33.349
[NAGARA groans]

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:38.062
Stop there! What do
you think you're doing?!

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:42.608
[SUSUGASHIRA]
So... what's the problem here?

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.989
Pretty impressive, isn't it?

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:51.492
Babel, reaching
all the way into Heaven.

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:52.827
A "giant emptiness."

00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:56.080
Created entirely by human
hands working together.

00:15:57.248 --> 00:15:59.459
[NAGARA]
I didn't know.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.127
Not until I learned...

00:16:02.753 --> 00:16:04.422
[MACHI]
You find Nagara?

00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:06.924
[NOZOMI] Mm‐hmm.
Apparently, Mizuho and Yamabiko

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:08.092
went to pick him up.

00:16:08.134 --> 00:16:10.887
[MACHI] Hmm? And they don't
need your help with that?

00:16:10.928 --> 00:16:14.390
I don't think there's much
I could do to help them.

00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:16.809
[HOSHI]
Don't worry.

00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:19.687
Nagara has the power
to change worlds, after all.

00:16:19.729 --> 00:16:21.022
And besides that...

00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:22.648
...he'll be just fine
on his own.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.860
Are you saying that
because God told you?

00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:28.196
[HOSHI]
I don't hear that voice anymore.

00:16:28.237 --> 00:16:31.032
We should have done
this a lot sooner.

00:16:31.073 --> 00:16:33.993
If I'd've listened to you,
it would've been easier.

00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:35.828
Too late for that.

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:41.334
[HAYATO]
Nozomi!

00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:46.380
[NOZOMI]
Mm.

00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:50.927
[HAYATO]
Hmm.

00:16:50.968 --> 00:16:53.888
[HOSHI] At last, the time
has come for us to depart.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.390
We're starting on a journey
to find our own place.

00:16:56.432 --> 00:16:59.727
Never fear, because now,
we have our freedom!

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:02.313
And more importantly,
we have our friendship.

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:03.397
So let's get going!

00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:05.149
[STUDENTS]
Yeah!

00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:13.241
Goodbye.

00:17:15.451 --> 00:17:18.371
[MIZUHO] Am I the only one who's
worried about Nagara or what?

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.415
This should be it.

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:30.508
[KOUMORI grunting]

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:31.717
[TEACHER 07A]
See that boy?

00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:34.095
He couldn't even do
a back hip circle before.

00:17:34.136 --> 00:17:37.682
But he practiced over and over
again, and look at him now!

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:39.016
[KOUMORI chuckles]

00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:44.355
[NAGARA] Everyone calls
that boy "Koumori the bat."

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:46.148
I don't want to be like him.

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:49.610
I don't see the point in
being able to do that stuff.

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:54.156
[SUSUGASHIRA]
What are you doing?

00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:56.158
Turning the world upside down.

00:17:57.159 --> 00:17:58.578
[NAGARA]
Gotta keep moving forward,

00:17:58.619 --> 00:18:00.705
to make up for everyone else.

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:07.420
[SUSUGASHIRA]
You knew you could do that?

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:10.131
Give my guide my best.

00:18:18.806 --> 00:18:20.057
[KOUMORI]
Hey, Nagara.

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:21.601
Welcome to the top.

00:18:21.642 --> 00:18:23.477
Pretty impressed
you made it here.

00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:27.106
[KOUMORI]
I wonder if you remember me.

00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:33.279
[NAGARA gasps]
Nope, so who are you?

00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:35.072
They call me Koumori.

00:18:38.659 --> 00:18:39.827
[NAGARA gasps]

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:45.166
[KOUMORI] This world is upside
down, and nothing but a big pit.

00:18:45.207 --> 00:18:46.709
To keep everyone safe,

00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:49.045
I lock hope up in there.

00:18:49.086 --> 00:18:52.923
Using my power,
"Upside‐Down."

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.634
All of this is my fault.

00:18:54.675 --> 00:18:56.135
[KOUMORI]
Hmm?

00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:59.639
[NAGARA] I've made up my mind.
I'm not running away anymore.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.017
If we've gone adrift,
I don't want it to be a mistake.

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:04.727
[KOUMORI]
You certainly have changed.

00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:07.480
[footsteps]

00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:10.900
[MIZUHO] Hey! Wanna explain
what's going on here?

00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:13.903
[KOUMORI] Heh. I guess
you're all right now.

00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:17.490
[KOUMORI]
You're free to go.

00:19:17.531 --> 00:19:18.699
[VICTIM'S ASSEMBLY yelling]

00:19:18.741 --> 00:19:21.118
[GROUP PRESIDENT 07A] Why'd you
let Nagara off like that?

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.536
[KOUMORI] Because I don't
think we should give in

00:19:22.578 --> 00:19:24.330
to the absurdity.

00:19:24.372 --> 00:19:28.793
Besides, he's a castaway.
Just like all of us.

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:30.544
[VICTIM 07B] You should
have punished that guy!

00:19:30.586 --> 00:19:32.546
This'll put a stop to it?

00:19:32.588 --> 00:19:34.965
[KOUMORI]
No more meaningless tragedies.

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:37.760
Will that be enough
to convince all the others?

00:19:37.802 --> 00:19:39.136
[KOUMORI]
Without an observer,

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:42.598
everyone would just be
probabilities, and nothing more.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.894
They have to understand, that
no matter where we may end up,

00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:49.230
we have to keep on fighting.

00:19:50.815 --> 00:19:55.027
[KOUMORI] No one is going to
pin all the blame on Nagara.

00:19:55.069 --> 00:19:57.405
I won't allow that to happen.

00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:02.410
[NOZOMI]
The others already left.

00:20:02.451 --> 00:20:03.703
[NAGARA]
Okay.

00:20:03.744 --> 00:20:05.705
They're not coming back, huh?

00:20:05.746 --> 00:20:08.165
No, they said they weren't.

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:12.378
[NOZOMI]
Oh, yeah, here ya go.

00:20:14.588 --> 00:20:15.798
[NAGARA]
Hey.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.758
‐‐What do you think?
‐‐[NOZOMI] Hmm?

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.261
[NAGARA] We ever gonna
make it back home, or what?

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:24.306
Has the "light" gone out?

00:20:24.348 --> 00:20:27.476
[NOZOMI]
Hmm. Well, I...

00:20:27.518 --> 00:20:30.646
[ship horn blares]

00:20:34.692 --> 00:20:37.069
[RAJDHANI] I've decided
to take this on a journey.

00:20:37.111 --> 00:20:39.780
I'll travel to all the other
"This Worlds" and figure out

00:20:39.822 --> 00:20:42.324
what's going on
in this universe.

00:20:42.366 --> 00:20:44.285
Don't know how far
this thing'll go,

00:20:44.326 --> 00:20:46.829
but I'm gonna try.

00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:48.998
Well, I think that if you
put your mind to it,

00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:50.750
you can do anything.

00:20:50.791 --> 00:20:53.127
I'm a hundred percent sure!

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:54.837

[RAJDHANI]
Hmm?

00:20:57.965 --> 00:21:00.593
Well, you know that statue
of Buddha you loved?

00:21:00.634 --> 00:21:03.971
Gen broke it,
I secretly replaced it.

00:21:06.348 --> 00:21:08.893
[MIZUHO] Sorry...
Had to get that off my chest.

00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:10.436
Only once?

00:21:11.395 --> 00:21:14.774
[chuckles]
It's okay. You're both forgiven.

00:21:14.815 --> 00:21:17.526
Oh, Nagara.
Had something to give to you.

00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:22.573
[RAJDHANI] Here. This is the
power holdover you got

00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:25.367
from monkey mountain,
"Monkey Furball."

00:21:25.409 --> 00:21:29.830
I've been trying to verify what
it does, and I finally know.

00:21:29.872 --> 00:21:30.998
What's that?

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.625
Take a whiff.

00:21:32.666 --> 00:21:33.751
[NAGARA]
Mm.

00:21:33.793 --> 00:21:35.002
[sniffing]

00:21:35.044 --> 00:21:36.629
Smells good, huh?

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:39.298
Yeah, it smells like sunshine.

00:21:40.591 --> 00:21:42.051
Uh, is that it?

00:21:42.092 --> 00:21:43.135
That's it.

00:21:43.177 --> 00:21:45.513
But that scent will never
change or fade away,

00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:47.223
no matter what you do.

00:21:47.264 --> 00:21:50.726
Set it on fire, you can
even boil it in curry.

00:21:50.768 --> 00:21:55.648
No matter where it is, or what
happens to it, it never changes.

00:21:55.689 --> 00:21:58.692

planning to stay on the island?

do anything, Nozomi.

You get what's
going on, don't you?

00:22:52.788 --> 00:22:56.417
It doesn't matter anymore
if we can't ever go back home.

00:22:56.458 --> 00:22:59.670
That may be true,
but that won't stop me.

00:22:59.712 --> 00:23:01.630
That's all there is.

00:23:01.672 --> 00:23:02.631
[ASAKAZE sighs]

00:23:02.673 --> 00:23:04.133
Works for me.

00:23:04.174 --> 00:23:05.134
Let's go.

00:23:05.175 --> 00:23:07.845
So you in, Nozomi?

00:23:07.887 --> 00:23:09.388
Honestly...

00:23:11.807 --> 00:23:13.559
...I have no idea.
