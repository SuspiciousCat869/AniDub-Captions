00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.186
[GIRL 10A]
I still wish I was stupid rich!

00:00:19.228 --> 00:00:20.395
[GIRL 10B]
That girl's shoes are so cute.

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:22.231
[BOY 10A] Come on, why won't
she just text back?

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:23.315
[GIRL 10C]
I seriously need a boyfriend.

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:25.400
[GIRL 10D] I'm so sleepy,
maybe I'll sleep on the train.

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:27.236
[GIRL 10E]
Idiot just stepped on my foot!

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:28.403
People need to watch themselves.

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:30.405
[BOY 10G] That's it!
I'm staying home tomorrow.

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:33.033
[BOY 10H]
Ugh. Nobody actually likes me.

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:35.869
[GIRL 10G] My horoscope said
it's supposed to be a good day

00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:38.121
Hmm? That guy is super cute!

00:00:38.914 --> 00:00:41.500
[KOSSETSU] I have the ability
to read people's minds.

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:45.087
Or, I guess it's more that I can
hear their "internal monologue"?

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:46.713
Kinda like they're
talking to me.

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:48.799
[BOY 10I]
My blog is really on point.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.009
I just need to get
more people to read it.

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:54.555
[GIRL 10H] I'm gonna eat
so much meat later!

00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:55.889
[KOSSETSU]
So it only makes sense that

00:00:55.931 --> 00:00:58.392
I call this power "Monologue."

00:00:58.433 --> 00:00:59.851
I haven't told anyone.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:01.979
I don't think it'd be good
if people knew.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.314
They'd steer clear of me,
that's for sure.

00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:06.650
Truth is, as much
as someone may talk,

00:01:06.692 --> 00:01:09.570
they rarely want you to know
what they're really thinking.

00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:11.863
That's why I lied
on that power survey.

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:14.074
I told them that my dumb
little trick of sticking coins

00:01:14.116 --> 00:01:17.369
to my head was some
kind of magnetism.

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:20.163
This is my secret‐‐
nobody else knows about it.

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:22.332
And from what I can hear,
no one even suspects

00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:24.126
I'm reading their minds.

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:26.587
I'm actually 100% sure of it.

00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:27.921
If they were thinking that,

00:01:27.963 --> 00:01:31.508
I would definitely know, whether
they wanted me to or not.

00:01:34.553 --> 00:01:36.805
[KOSSETSU] I guess I got
here a little too early.

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:42.603
Ah. Hmm.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.331
Probably a little too quick.

00:02:03.332 --> 00:02:05.834
[KOSSETSU] But now, I'll
get some more time with him.

00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:12.174
[KOSSETSU] We went and
visited a few other worlds,

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:16.261
and now we're finally done
with Ms. Aki's summer camp.

00:02:16.303 --> 00:02:18.972
It wasn't easy by any means,
but we've all gotten her,

00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:22.017
quote, "compulsory education."

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:25.646
We were dismissed and given
the rank of Private Fifth class.

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:28.398
Plus, an invitation
to the battlefield.

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:33.779
[KOSSETSU] But I was
seriously bummed out,

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.364
because that meant
I didn't have an excuse

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.741
to be around him like before.

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:41.536
[KOSSETSU] I hope it's not
too obvious to everyone,

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:43.830
but I really like Asakaze.

00:02:45.457 --> 00:02:46.833
[KAGA]
Thanks to Ms. Aki's relentless

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:48.710
and intensive
training and guidance,

00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:52.798
we were able to successfully
complete our summer camp today!

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:56.051
Let's also thank those who
worked so hard by our side.

00:02:56.093 --> 00:02:58.011
The bonds that
we've created here

00:02:58.053 --> 00:02:59.304
will never be undone.

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:02.432
[KAGA thinking] I ended up
being a total nobody, huh?

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:06.103
Who cares that I had perfect
attendance? It's so lame.

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:08.271
I just don't have anything
to look forward to.

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:11.233
[STUDENTS laughing, murmuring]

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:14.736
You were actually chosen by God?
For the elite course?

00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:16.863
That's impressive,
even for you, man!

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:19.825
I feel super lucky to have been
in the same class as you!

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:21.868
Aw, no big.

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:24.413
[ASAKAZE] Not gonna lie,
it feels kinda good

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:26.581
to get this much attention.

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:29.876
But there's something else
going on here, it's weird.

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:31.962
[DAIYA] This chump
is so full of himself.

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:34.381
[ASAMA] Can't wait till
you fail, dumbass.

00:03:34.423 --> 00:03:37.050
[ASAKAZE] I know they're just
lying to me and blowing smoke.

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:38.593
Guess they're trying to be nice,

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:40.429
but I know they
don't mean any of it.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.765
Whatever makes them feel good,
at least I'm nothing like them.

00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:45.892
I don't mean apples and
oranges, either, more like

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:47.769
the toilet bowl and its turds.

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:49.312
[KOSSETSU grunts]

00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:52.107
[KOSSETSU]
He's really on a roll today.

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:54.401
I'm the only one who knows
who he really is.

00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:57.863
Way more interesting than
the others, and a true rebel.

00:03:59.281 --> 00:04:02.242
[KAGA] Hey, j‐just wondering
if you caught my speech.

00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:03.952
[KOSSETSU]
Yeah, it was very nice.

00:04:03.994 --> 00:04:07.456
Oh, really?
I was kinda nervous, so...

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:10.041
[KAGA thinking] Man, she's
looking super cute today.

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.002
I'm gonna miss seeing her.

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:14.254
I should just
tell her how I feel!

00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:16.590
No, I'm too scared,
but maybe I can just ask her

00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:17.799
to hang out sometime.

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:20.552
Uh. Uh...

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:21.553
[GIRL giggling]

00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:22.721
[BOY 10J]
Whoa! That's a lot!

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:32.147
[KOSSETSU sighs]
That was way too awkward for me.

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:36.485
[KOSSETSU] I'm really not all
that different from Kaga.

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:39.738
And he's really
not interested in me.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.908
Ah. Something up?

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.951
Um.

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:47.662
You talked to Nozomi lately?

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:49.706
I'm just curious
how she's doing.

00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:51.666
Not that I really care.

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:53.543
[ASAKAZE]
Man, I'm worried about her.

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:56.087
I miss her like crazy.

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:00.342
She's kind of useless, but she
acts like such a big deal.

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:02.219
[KOSSETSU]
He's totally in love with her.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.013
Been like that ever since
we started drifting.

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:06.306
[KOSSETSU]
She seems fine.

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:09.392
She's just been on Hateno Island
with Nagara and the others.

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:11.269
Why the hell is she still there?

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.605
[ASAKAZE]
Nagara! I hate that scumbag.

00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:16.274
She wouldn't be on that island
if it weren't for him.

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:19.027
Anyway, I kinda need
a favor from you.

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:21.738
Think you could help me
out with something?

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.865
[ASAKAZE thinking] I just need
someone to do the crap work.

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:26.117
She's perfect for that,
and I don't think anybody ever

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.744
asks her for anything.

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:29.746
Make her think she's
doing something worthwhile,

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:32.123
and it'll be the
highlight of her life.

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:35.460
[KOSSETSU]
I was actually just wondering

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:38.547
what my next move would be.
You sure I can help?

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:41.299
[ASAKAZE thinking] Awesome,
she's obviously into me.

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:45.554
Ah. Too bad I don't feel the
same about her, like, at all.

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.764
You don't have to
answer me right away.

00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:49.599
Just think it over.

00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:52.686
Uh‐huh. Thanks, I will.

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:54.354
[KOSSETSU]
He's stubborn, selfish,

00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:57.315
and honestly kind of a jerk.

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:58.942
Doesn't make any sense.

00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:01.278
It hurts every time
I talk to him.

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:05.323
[KOSSETSU] But I can't help
the way I feel about him‐‐

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:07.117
I'm smitten.

00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:09.411
Felt this way since
the whole thing started.

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:10.453
[grunting]

00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:11.913
[ASAKAZE ]
You wanna know why?

00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:16.126
It has nothing to do with your
"power." It's just how it is.

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:17.794
[ASAKAZE thinking] This is what
you get for being pushy,

00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:20.672
you stupid gorilla.
I'm the chosen one here.

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:22.215
You're gonna learn
to start respecting me,

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:23.592
or you're gonna regret it.

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:24.926
[CAP]
I won't accept that.

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:28.138
You hear me?!
Everybody has to do what I say!

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:31.516
[ASAKAZE] Wow, you look even
more like a gorilla than usual!

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:35.353
Just go away, man! I never
wanna see your dumb face again!

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.689

He's... so cruel.

[NOZOMI grunts]

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.447
[ASAKAZE] What does she
see in Nagara, anyway?

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:47.824
I'm the one
protecting everybody.

00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:50.327
I just want her
to look at me like that!

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:51.786
[KOSSETSU grunts]

00:06:58.293 --> 00:07:01.171
[ASAKAZE] I'm not the same
person I was before.

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:04.841
[ASAKAZE]
This is awesome...

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:07.135
She'd love it
if I showed it to her.

Nozomi!

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:16.811
Let her go off by herself.

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:20.982
[ASAKAZE thinking]
All I wanna do is keep her safe.

00:07:21.024 --> 00:07:23.360
She's just gonna
slow everyone down.

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:25.362
Do you actually mean that?!

00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:26.738
[ASAKAZE thinking] This is
gonna make Nozomi rethink

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.281
how she feels about me.

00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:30.241
Only reason she turned me down,
is 'cause she doesn't know

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:32.243
who I really am.

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:36.206
I do. It's best if she
didn't go with you.

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:37.832
[KOSSETSU grunts]

00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:41.336
[KOSSETSU] I'm sure
his unrequited love

00:07:41.378 --> 00:07:43.630
left him completely heartbroken.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:47.842
[KOSSETSU] In my dreams,
I can see him being an outcast

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:51.846
from the world someday. He'll be
all alone and that's when

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:55.850
he'll realize I was the one
for him this entire time.

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:59.396
But I know I'm just dreaming.
He'd never come to me.

00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:02.107
Because he thinks
I'm some ugly loser.

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:05.694
Yeah. The whole world
would have to change.

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:08.488

down a dangerous path.

[KOSSETSU growls]

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:34.139
[KOSSETSU] She doesn't care
about him as a person at all.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.641
The only thing she
cares about is his power.

Ugh. What a pain in the neck.

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:42.981

Right now!

[PRINCIPAL] There is currently
someone who jeopardizes

the existence of this world.
The one called War.

So I'm asking you to put
a stop to War immediately.

has been able to accomplish it,

I know you can do it.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.595
[KOSSETSU]
Because we're all in stasis,

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:16.598
we don't really have
a way to move forward.

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:20.268
Can't do anything
about it, just the way it is.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.228
We don't know
where the trains are going,

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.938
what roles we've been given,

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.441
or even who we're
supposed to fight.

00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:29.027
Only thing we can be sure of,
is this general feeling

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:30.612
of insecurity.

00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:37.827
[KOSSETSU] Even though they said
we're supposed to never die.

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.246
[KOSSETSU]
But for whatever reason,

00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:43.124
Asakaze thinks that
he can change the world.

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:46.711
He's obsessed with this
"important job only I can do."

00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:49.464
[KOSSETSU]
It's pointless.

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:52.217
I could never change him,
much less the world.

00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:55.303
Meow.

00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:56.846
[gasping]

00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:03.978
Each of the three cats
has their own role to play.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.106
[YAMABIKO]
Tora places the orders,

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:08.733
Gen is in charge
of transportation,

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:11.152
and Sakura makes copies
of the things being brought

00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:13.279
from your old world.

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:16.116
That includes living things.

00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:19.869
[gasps] Hey, Sakura.
You should make another me!

00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:21.371
Eh?

00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:25.792
[MIZUHO]
Oh, come on, just do it!

00:10:25.834 --> 00:10:27.377
[SAKURA]
Mreowr!

00:10:27.418 --> 00:10:30.588
[YAMABIKO sighs] The cats have
their own code of ethics.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.632
If they aren't careful
with their powers,

00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:35.426
things could very
easily end in tragedy.

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:38.429
Okay... So does this mean she
had something to do with us

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:40.390
being "castaway copies?"

00:10:40.431 --> 00:10:42.684
Yeah, probably.

00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:44.644
But I'd be willing to bet
it's like Nagara's power

00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:46.729
to create worlds.

00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:51.025
She wasn't aware of what she was
doing, it just kinda happened.

00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:54.279
Huh. Well, what about you?

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.489
What have you been
doing all this time?

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:58.449
You talkin' to me?

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:00.076
Hmm...

00:11:00.118 --> 00:11:02.954
What have I been
doing all this time?

00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:11.254
[NAGARA] Raj never took
the cats' opinions into account.

00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:14.966
[NAGARA] Maybe that's why he
didn't pick up on what Mizuho

00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:16.759
is really capable of.

00:11:17.969 --> 00:11:19.304
[MIZUHO]
Huh...

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:23.975
[NAGARA] We're stuck,
caught up in this drift

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:25.560
that had already happened.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.688
[NAGARA] But Mizuho's
power might be the reason

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.107
we're in this static state.

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:32.275
[NOZOMI grunts]

00:11:33.568 --> 00:11:35.653
[YAMABIKO sighs]

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:39.282
I hate to say it, but if you
had known this back then,

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:42.076
things might've
turned out differently.

00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:48.082
[TORA chirps]

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:04.390
[NOZOMI] I think I might
end up going over there.

00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:05.558
[NAGARA]
Hmm?

00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:10.230
‐‐[phone rings]
‐‐Uh?

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:15.318
I was kinda wondering...

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.527
[NOZOMI]
Hmm?

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:18.780
[NAGARA] What happened
to you hating smartphones?

00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:21.449
Heh. Guess even I can change.

00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:24.786
[KOSSETSU]
Nozomi's the real deal.

00:12:24.827 --> 00:12:28.206
She's the only one that I know
never lied to the others.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.301
[NOZOMI] My heart tells me
not to go with them.

00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:41.970
And whenever that happens...

00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:43.554
...I always listen.

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:48.393
[KOSSETSU] I wonder if she would
be willing to talk him into‐‐

00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:49.852
Mm?

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:52.272
It's been a while.

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:54.774
What? Am I here late?

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.277
[KOSSETSU]
Mm‐mm.

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:06.494
[NOZOMI]
Whoa... It's humongous.

00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:08.329
[ASAKAZE]
What are you doing here?

00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:09.622
[NOZOMI]
What's it to you?

00:13:09.664 --> 00:13:11.457
I've got work to do.

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:14.043
Yeah, I know that.

00:13:14.085 --> 00:13:16.796
Doesn't change the fact
that she's here now.

00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:19.257
Where'd you run off
to with Ms. Aki?

00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:22.260
[ASAKAZE] Got a mission to kill
a bad guy for world peace.

00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:25.763
Oh, wow, I always knew
you were amazing!

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:30.059
[KOSSETSU] So... do you think
Nozomi and I could tag along

00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:32.145
with you when you
go on this mission?

00:13:32.186 --> 00:13:33.396
[ASAKAZE]
But why?

00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:35.148
[KOSSETSU] Well,
I just think it'd be really cool

00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:36.566
to see you in action.

00:13:36.607 --> 00:13:38.276
Don't you think
that sounds cool?

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:40.361
Um, I'm not so sure.

00:13:40.403 --> 00:13:42.363
Of course, you are!

00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:44.198
[NOZOMI]
Mm...

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.451
[ASAKAZE]
It's gonna be dangerous.

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:49.829
The one we're gonna kill...
is War himself.

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.167
It's "War"?

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:58.713
[NOZOMI]
This world is "War," too?

00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:05.553
[KOSSETSU]
Mm.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:11.434
[KOSSETSU]
Ugh, I hate her!

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:59.208
[KOSSETSU, NOZOMI]
Hmm?

00:16:04.922 --> 00:16:07.550
So is this guy War?

00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:09.969
What's the deal with him?

00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:12.180
Hello? Are you okay?

00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:17.477
[KOSSETSU] There's nothing
there, it's like he's empty.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.940
[AKI thinking]
I know what you're doing.

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:24.525
[gasps]

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:33.826
The food...

00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:36.496
It's probably ready, huh?

00:16:36.537 --> 00:16:39.290
[KOSSETSU]
Ah. Oh, guess so.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.669
What's up? Is something wrong?

00:16:43.711 --> 00:16:46.088
You've been a little off
since we met up.

00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:50.259
I'm sorry, it's just...

00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:52.678
[NOZOMI]
Huh?

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.310
[ASAKAZE]
Let's take a quick break.

00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:02.522
Man, this place is boring.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.776
[ASAKAZE]
Where's this War guy?

00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:09.612
So what're you gonna do
when you find him?

00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:11.906
[ASAKAZE]
Hmm? Why do you ask?

00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:14.116
Gonna kill him
just 'cause he's War?

00:17:14.158 --> 00:17:17.912
[ASAKAZE sighs] There's no
police or army or whatever.

00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:21.290
So somebody has to do it.
That would be me.

00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:24.418
You don't even know
what War is, so why you?

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.379
Where do you get off,
creating death?

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:30.299
So conceited‐‐
you think you're God?

00:17:30.341 --> 00:17:33.219
How in the hell do you
even know about all that?

00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:37.181
It's because that plain girl
can see right through us.

00:17:37.223 --> 00:17:38.474
[KOSSETSU whimpers]

00:17:39.976 --> 00:17:42.144
Her power allows her
to read other people's minds

00:17:42.186 --> 00:17:44.063
without even trying.

00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:47.275
[ASAKAZE gasps]
Is that true...?

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:52.488
[ASAKAZE]
So you know everything?

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:56.325
What I'm thinking right now?
Things I haven't told anybody?

00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:58.411
Sorry.

00:17:58.452 --> 00:18:00.329
[gasps]

00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:08.254
[ASAKAZE]
Those two...

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:11.007
They think I'm an idiot!
They're mocking me!

00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:13.301
[AKI]
It's okay.

00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:16.220
When I focus in a little bit
and adjust the scale,

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.931
I hear her voice clearly.

00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:22.059
It's yet another
useful perk of my power.

00:18:29.817 --> 00:18:31.277
[ASAKAZE sighs]

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:36.782
[gasps]

00:18:36.824 --> 00:18:37.825
[NOZOMI]
Hmm.

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:44.582
[NOZOMI sighs]

00:18:52.506 --> 00:18:53.924
[KOSSETSU grunts]

00:18:59.513 --> 00:19:02.850
[BOTH laugh]

00:19:04.018 --> 00:19:05.311
[NOZOMI]
I'm all done.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.481
[KOSSETSU] Those are more
power holdovers, huh?

00:19:08.522 --> 00:19:10.858
Yep. Little "present"
from Nagara.

00:19:12.526 --> 00:19:14.862
They're actually
pretty perfect for me.

00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:18.115
[KOSSETSU]
It's weird.

00:19:18.157 --> 00:19:21.619
This gorge looks like someone
cut a deep wound into the world.

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:26.707
Yeah. Kinda goes with what
Yamabiko said about War.

00:19:26.749 --> 00:19:30.461
I wonder... We actually
gonna find War in here?

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:32.922
I was wondering that, too.

00:19:32.963 --> 00:19:36.008
I could hear a lot of voices
at the train station...

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:40.221
...but none of them seemed
to know anything about War.

00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:54.860
[NOZOMI]
I may not be able to read minds,

00:19:54.902 --> 00:19:57.697
but I can tell exactly
what you're thinking.

00:19:57.738 --> 00:20:00.449
Real funny. Who do you
think made it possible

00:20:00.491 --> 00:20:02.118
for you to even be here?

00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:04.829
I've helped you, you know.
You could at least try to‐‐

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:07.540
[NOZOMI] You wanna know the
real reason I turned you down?

00:20:07.581 --> 00:20:10.000
Because I can't respect you,
is the thing.

00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:12.128
You make it too hard.

00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:15.715
Is that so? Well, God
and everybody else does.

00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:18.092
[NOZOMI] I don't give a crap
what everyone else thinks,

00:20:18.134 --> 00:20:20.344
it's what you
think that matters!

00:20:20.386 --> 00:20:22.930
I'm not doing this.
I need to leave.

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:26.475
Even if I'm dead, I can
accept the fate I was given.

00:20:28.394 --> 00:20:30.896
[ASAKAZE] I could never
be as strong as you.

00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:35.776
[ASAKAZE] I couldn't see past
my power to who I really was.

00:20:35.818 --> 00:20:37.111
[gasps]

00:20:38.487 --> 00:20:40.531
[ASAKAZE]
I kept chasing after you...

00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:42.950
...because I could
never be like you.

00:20:44.493 --> 00:20:48.581
But... I'm done with all that.

00:20:48.622 --> 00:20:51.000
'Kay. Understood.

00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:53.127
Then I guess this is goodbye.

00:20:55.296 --> 00:20:56.797
[KOSSETSU]
I see now.

00:20:56.839 --> 00:21:00.217
She really was the only one who
could change him for the better.

00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:03.554
[NAGARA] This time,
I'll show you the light.

00:21:05.097 --> 00:21:07.516
[NOZOMI] Let's find this War,
and put an end to 'em!

00:21:07.558 --> 00:21:08.517
[ASAKAZE gasps]

00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:12.104
It seems like you're the only
one who can conquer this world.

00:21:12.146 --> 00:21:13.439
It's obvious.

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:16.692
For whatever reason, you were
the one chosen to do it.

00:21:16.734 --> 00:21:17.985
[ASAKAZE growls]

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:24.158
[NOZOMI] The only thing here,
is this massive, open wound.

00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:28.746
Which means he's
been here way too long.

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:30.372
So let's change that.

00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:50.810
[gasps]
Nozomi!

00:21:50.851 --> 00:21:52.353
Come on.

00:21:53.395 --> 00:21:54.980
[PRINCIPAL]
You can do many things,

00:21:55.022 --> 00:21:57.942
except see what's in your heart.

00:21:57.983 --> 00:22:00.152
[KOSSETSU]
Asakaze!

00:22:00.194 --> 00:22:01.612
[ASAKAZE gasps]

00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:08.327
No... but why...?
