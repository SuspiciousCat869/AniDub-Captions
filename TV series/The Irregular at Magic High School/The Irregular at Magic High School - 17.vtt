[Man] First High School's
overall victory

00:00:10.788 --> 00:00:12.626
is practically in the bag now.

00:00:12.692 --> 00:00:15.130
[Man 2] If they do go on
to secure the championship,

00:00:15.197 --> 00:00:17.268
our losses will
be over 100 million,

00:00:17.334 --> 00:00:19.138
and that's in US dollars.

00:00:19.205 --> 00:00:20.173
[Man 3] Are you just going
to give up, then?

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.409
Don't be absurd.

00:00:21.476 --> 00:00:22.913
It'd be no different
from sitting here

00:00:22.979 --> 00:00:24.181
and waiting to die.

00:00:24.248 --> 00:00:26.152
[Man 4] With a lost as huge
as this one,

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:28.490
death won't be so simple.
If we're lucky,

00:00:28.558 --> 00:00:30.595
they'll turn us
into half dead generators.

00:00:31.764 --> 00:00:33.333
[Man 5] Now that it's all come
to this,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.337
we can't afford
to be picky about our methods.

00:00:35.404 --> 00:00:37.809
And if we have to resort
to more brutal means,

00:00:37.876 --> 00:00:39.312
then that's what we have to do.

00:00:39.378 --> 00:00:41.951
Hell, it doesn't matter
if our customers are suspicious.

00:00:42.017 --> 00:00:45.190
As long as we leave no evidence,
we can give any excuse.

00:00:45.792 --> 00:00:47.294
James is right.

00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:49.600
Let's send in some more agents.

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.604
We need them
to target Mirage Bat.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.106
[Man 2] They will have
to force everyone

00:00:53.173 --> 00:00:55.143
of First High's competitors
to withdraw

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.348
by any means necessary.

00:00:57.414 --> 00:00:59.620
[Man] If these teenagers' luck
somehow holds out,

00:00:59.686 --> 00:01:00.588
they won't die,

00:01:00.655 --> 00:01:03.159

that they weren't

00:01:03.226 --> 00:01:04.796

00:08:53.734 --> 00:08:54.969
Is that correct?

00:08:55.036 --> 00:08:57.508
You played
a magnificent match yesterday.

00:08:57.575 --> 00:08:59.879
So please tell me
what's happened.

00:08:59.946 --> 00:09:00.948
Yes, sir.

00:09:01.015 --> 00:09:03.152
The CADs used
by my school's athletes

00:09:03.219 --> 00:09:04.522
have been tampered with.

00:09:04.589 --> 00:09:06.225
I apprehended the culprit
and was about

00:09:06.292 --> 00:09:08.630
to interrogate him to see
if I could find out who

00:09:08.697 --> 00:09:10.601
was behind this.

00:09:10.668 --> 00:09:12.437
[Retsu] Is that right?

00:09:12.505 --> 00:09:14.007
Mm.

00:09:14.609 --> 00:09:15.878
Hmm.

00:09:16.245 --> 00:09:19.853
True, a foreign element
has been injected into this.

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:22.491
When I was still
on active military duty,

00:09:22.558 --> 00:09:24.294
the magicians
of the Guangdong Army

00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:27.167
used this during the battle
of the East China Seas.

00:09:27.234 --> 00:09:28.604
GES.

00:09:29.739 --> 00:09:32.010
Golden Electron Silkworms‐‐

00:09:32.077 --> 00:09:35.350
a delayed activation sequence
that invades electronic devices

00:09:35.417 --> 00:09:36.853
causing malfunctions.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.626
Until our technicians were able
to identify the spell,

00:09:39.692 --> 00:09:42.030
my brothers in arms suffered
many casualties.

00:09:42.097 --> 00:09:44.435
Did you know this is what caused
those accidents?

00:09:44.502 --> 00:09:45.771
[Tatsuya] Negative.

00:09:45.838 --> 00:09:48.142
I've never heard the term
Golden Electron Silkworms

00:09:48.209 --> 00:09:49.311
until this moment,

00:09:49.378 --> 00:09:51.750
although I immediately
recognized something

00:09:51.817 --> 00:09:53.987
eerily similar to a virus
had been injected into

00:09:54.054 --> 00:09:56.091
a system I designed myself.

00:09:56.158 --> 00:09:57.194
[gasping]

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.833
[Retsu] Very good.
So tell me, saboteur.

00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:03.072
Where on Earth did you acquire
this illegal magic sequence?

00:10:04.374 --> 00:10:05.778
[shuddering]

00:10:08.584 --> 00:10:10.320
[Retsu] Now then,
Mr. Shiba,

00:10:10.386 --> 00:10:11.990
I do believe you should
be getting back

00:10:12.057 --> 00:10:14.027
to the stadium as soon
as possible,

00:10:14.094 --> 00:10:16.666
and I'd use a backup CAD,
if I were you,

00:10:16.733 --> 00:10:18.136
in light of the situation.

00:10:18.202 --> 00:10:21.041
There's no need for you
to have it checked pre‐match.

00:10:21.442 --> 00:10:23.981
To imagine that somebody among
the tournament staff

00:10:24.047 --> 00:10:25.885
was involved in tampering.

00:10:25.951 --> 00:10:27.922
‐ A scandal beyond belief.
‐ [gasps]

00:10:27.989 --> 00:10:30.561
I'll expect you as head
of staff to explain this

00:10:30.628 --> 00:10:31.530
to me later.

00:10:31.596 --> 00:10:32.632
Hmm.

00:10:32.698 --> 00:10:35.436
‐ [Retsu] Tatsuya Shiba.
‐ Hmm?

00:10:35.971 --> 00:10:38.777
I'd also like to hear
from you again in the future.

00:10:39.879 --> 00:10:42.417
Yes, if I get the opportunity.

00:10:42.852 --> 00:10:44.656
[Retsu] I suppose I'll
be looking forward

00:10:44.722 --> 00:10:47.093
to that opportunity
most eagerly.

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:55.210
[indistinct chatter]

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.117
[all gasping]

00:11:02.224 --> 00:11:03.660
‐ [Miyuki] Brother!
‐ [gasps]

00:11:03.727 --> 00:11:05.831
[breathing heavily]

00:11:06.933 --> 00:11:08.871
I apologize if I worried you,
Miyuki.

00:11:08.937 --> 00:11:11.075
No, it's fine.
Still, though.

00:11:11.141 --> 00:11:14.147
It's just whenever you're
truly angry about something,

00:11:14.214 --> 00:11:17.220
I've noticed that, well,
it's always been for my sake.

00:11:17.287 --> 00:11:19.224
[chuckles]
I guess you're right.

00:11:19.759 --> 00:11:21.897
It's really only ever
for your sake

00:11:21.963 --> 00:11:23.767
that I'll get genuinely angry.

00:11:25.136 --> 00:11:26.773
[Tatsuya] But listen to me.

00:11:27.608 --> 00:11:30.781
It's only natural for a brother
to protect his little sister.

00:11:30.948 --> 00:11:32.718
‐ [whimpers]
‐ [Tatsuya] And that feeling

00:11:32.785 --> 00:11:34.822
is the one and only
authentic thing left

00:11:34.889 --> 00:11:36.292
within my heart.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.031
‐ So believe me when I say‐‐
‐ [gasps]

00:11:39.097 --> 00:11:41.168
[Tatsuya] You don't need
to feel sad for me.

00:11:41.235 --> 00:11:42.738
And besides,

00:11:42.805 --> 00:11:45.076
it would be a shame
to ruin your makeup

00:11:45.143 --> 00:11:47.715
because it looks
particularly good today.

00:11:48.517 --> 00:11:49.953
Remember, Miyuki,

00:11:50.019 --> 00:11:52.224
this is your day
to shine bright.

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.426
Brother.

00:11:53.492 --> 00:11:54.862
You're embarrassing me.

00:11:55.363 --> 00:11:56.365
[chuckles]

00:11:56.432 --> 00:11:58.904
‐ [Mayumi] My, my, my, Tatsuya.
‐ Hmm?

00:11:59.271 --> 00:12:01.242
When I was informed by
the tournament committee

00:12:01.308 --> 00:12:03.580
that one of our students
had gone on a rampage,

00:12:03.647 --> 00:12:06.620
I simply did not know what
to make of this news,

00:12:06.686 --> 00:12:10.159
but it was just an older brother
with a hardcore sibling complex

00:12:10.226 --> 00:12:12.097
who went berserk
over someone messing

00:12:12.163 --> 00:12:14.602
with his precious little sister.

00:12:14.669 --> 00:12:18.476
[all laughing]
[stammering]

00:12:18.977 --> 00:12:22.083
[cheers and applause]

00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:28.129
[buzzing]
Hmm?

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:30.333
<i>[Tatsuya] It's hard</i>
<i>to believe Miyuki only</i>

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.905
<i>has this slim of a lead after</i>
<i>the second period.</i>

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.744
<i>The NSC is no joke.</i>

00:12:35.811 --> 00:12:37.047
‐ [Miyuki] Brother?
‐ [gasps]

00:12:39.953 --> 00:12:42.157
Is it all right with you
if I use the spell?

00:12:42.223 --> 00:12:43.392
[gasps]

00:12:43.459 --> 00:12:44.394
[exhales]

00:12:47.568 --> 00:12:48.870
‐ [Tatsuya] Yes.
‐ [gasps]

00:12:49.071 --> 00:12:51.108
You can do anything you want,
of course.

00:12:52.912 --> 00:12:54.047
Thank you!

00:12:54.549 --> 00:12:56.686
[cheering]

00:12:56.753 --> 00:12:57.688
[grunts]

00:12:57.755 --> 00:13:01.529
[beeping]

00:13:01.596 --> 00:13:02.865

[grunting]

00:13:34.862 --> 00:13:36.065
No way.

00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:38.035
Whoa, insane.
That's a flying spell.

00:13:39.739 --> 00:13:41.041
[grunts]

00:13:42.243 --> 00:13:44.214
[grunting]

00:13:45.483 --> 00:13:46.986
She's got flying magic?

00:13:47.053 --> 00:13:48.523
Isn't that Taurus Silver's,
though?

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:49.692
How's this possible?

00:13:49.759 --> 00:13:52.097
That sequence was only
just announced last month!

00:13:52.163 --> 00:13:54.067
[boy] I know,
but check her out!

00:13:54.434 --> 00:13:56.806
No question.
It's flying magic!

00:13:57.508 --> 00:13:59.411
[girl] She's flying!

00:14:05.256 --> 00:14:07.895
[buzzing]

00:14:09.799 --> 00:14:12.003
[magical whooshing]

[gasps]

00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:28.302
[giggles]

00:14:38.557 --> 00:14:40.694
[indistinct chatter]

00:14:40.761 --> 00:14:43.299
<i>[Man] I just received word</i>
<i>from Number 17.</i>

00:14:43.365 --> 00:14:45.938
Our target in the second round
of Mirage Bat

00:14:46.004 --> 00:14:47.240
made it to the final.

00:14:47.307 --> 00:14:48.643
<i>I think we're past the point</i>

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:50.581
<i>of being selective</i>
<i>about our methods,</i>

00:14:50.647 --> 00:14:51.683
<i>but who knows?</i>

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:54.087
<i>[Man 3] So,</i>
<i>what are you gonna do?</i>

00:14:54.154 --> 00:14:55.991
[Man] We have no choice
but to get

00:14:56.058 --> 00:14:57.828
the whole tournament called off.

00:14:58.229 --> 00:15:01.068
Using a generator
to indiscriminately kill 100

00:15:01.135 --> 00:15:03.540
or so of the audience members
should suffice.

00:15:03.607 --> 00:15:06.846
[Man 2] Will Number 17 alone
be enough manpower for the job?

00:15:06.913 --> 00:15:08.215
[Man] He has no weapons,

00:15:08.282 --> 00:15:10.420
but if we remove his limiter
and let him run wild

00:15:10.486 --> 00:15:13.627
he can kill 100 or two
with his bare hands.

00:15:13.693 --> 00:15:15.296
Won't the gamblers complain?

00:15:15.363 --> 00:15:17.000
The weapon brokers
will be a nightmare,

00:15:17.066 --> 00:15:18.537
never mind our associates.

00:15:18.603 --> 00:15:20.707
Arms dealers are tied
with various governments

00:15:20.774 --> 00:15:22.076
all around the world.

00:15:22.143 --> 00:15:23.880
We can figure out an excuse
for our clientele.

00:15:23.947 --> 00:15:26.953
Right now our main concern
should be our organization's

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.422
financial well being.

00:15:29.859 --> 00:15:31.395
[Man] Any objections?

00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:34.034
‐ [groans]
‐ [Man] Then it's decided.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.671
I'm removing the limiter.

00:15:37.173 --> 00:15:39.010
[magical whirring]

00:15:41.549 --> 00:15:43.587

[both grunting]

00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:08.402
‐ [Number 17 groans]
‐ That was quite a fall.

00:16:08.469 --> 00:16:09.605
Gotta admit,

00:16:09.672 --> 00:16:11.843
I'm impressed you were able
to survive.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.281
[Muraji] Who are you?
Never mind.

00:16:14.347 --> 00:16:16.051
There's no need for you
to answer.

00:16:16.118 --> 00:16:18.422
You probably
can't respond anyway.

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:22.932
The resilience of your body,
surely it's not only magic.

00:16:22.998 --> 00:16:24.602
Are you an enhanced human?

00:16:25.637 --> 00:16:27.140
[Shigeru] Muraji Yanagi.

00:16:27.207 --> 00:16:29.477
Didn't you just tell him
there's no need to answer?

00:16:29.545 --> 00:16:31.883
Besides, given that you landed
from the same height

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:32.952
but on your feet,

00:16:33.018 --> 00:16:34.856
it's safe too assume he doesn't

00:16:34.922 --> 00:16:36.291
wanna hear that from you, right?

00:16:37.327 --> 00:16:38.329
[scoffs]

00:16:43.707 --> 00:16:44.675
[booming]

00:16:50.119 --> 00:16:52.725
I wasn't expecting a reply
to that, FYI.

00:16:52.791 --> 00:16:54.060
[Muraji] Just thinkin' out loud.

00:16:54.127 --> 00:16:56.064
[chuckles]
Even so,

00:16:56.131 --> 00:16:58.102
it's always interesting
to see your work.

00:16:58.168 --> 00:17:00.406
[Shigeru] So was that Revolution
you used?

00:17:00.473 --> 00:17:02.043
[Muraji] I've told
you repeatedly.

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:03.445
It's not revolution.

00:17:03.513 --> 00:17:04.715
It's Flip.

00:17:04.782 --> 00:17:06.619
Enough with the witty banter.

00:17:06.686 --> 00:17:08.523
Are you gonna help me bring down
this criminal or what?

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:09.692
[electric sparking]
[grunts]

00:17:09.759 --> 00:17:10.694
[Shigeru] Oh, absolutely.

00:17:10.761 --> 00:17:11.829
Let's get right on that.
