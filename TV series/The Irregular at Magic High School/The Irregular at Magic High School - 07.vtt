an unwavering strength
in his heart and his soul.

Still,
even though I did respect him,

00:17:48.135 --> 00:17:49.538
he also frightened me.

[Sayaka] It wouldn't matter
how hard

00:17:54.782 --> 00:17:56.586
or fast I ran after him.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.924
In reality,
I could never,

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:00.627
ever catch up to him.

00:18:01.295 --> 00:18:03.667

as strong as him.

That's a great story.

So what about you, Kirihara?

00:18:26.813 --> 00:18:28.449
How long have you been pining
for Saya?

[Takeaki] Man, give it a rest,

It's none of your business!

00:18:33.158 --> 00:18:34.629
Yeah, he's right, Erika.

of time hardly matters.

Huh?

00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:38.737
[Tatsuya] The important
thing here

00:18:38.803 --> 00:18:41.976
is Kirihara is seriously smitten
with Miss Mibu.

00:18:42.043 --> 00:18:44.014
‐ Wait, hold up!
‐ Oh, yeah?

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.886
[Tatsuya] I can't go into detail
on account of confidentiality,

the brave figure Kirihara cut

00:18:51.829 --> 00:18:54.735

Do me a favor, Tatsuya.

Just so you know,

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:38.556
I would follow you wherever
you go no matter what.

[Miyuki] Even if you were
to rush off into

of sound.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.204

00:19:46.271 --> 00:19:48.442

the stars.

If I had to pick one of us,

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.826
I would argue I'm more likely
to get left behind by you.

00:19:57.661 --> 00:19:58.763
For now,

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.368
how about instead of us reaching
for the heavens,

00:20:01.435 --> 00:20:03.439
we both try to keep our feet
on the ground?

00:20:03.907 --> 00:20:05.777
[Miyuki] Are you going back
to school now?

00:20:06.178 --> 00:20:07.380
[Tatsuya] Yeah.

00:20:07.447 --> 00:20:09.484
If I miss my practical
skills class,

00:20:09.552 --> 00:20:11.421
I'll have to make it up over
the weekend.

00:20:12.423 --> 00:20:13.927
Um, Brother,

00:20:13.993 --> 00:20:16.666
Isn't it hard on you having
to go to Magic School?

00:20:17.266 --> 00:20:19.605
If it were under
normal circumstances,

00:20:19.672 --> 00:20:21.943
there'd be no reason for you
to go to high school at all,

00:20:22.009 --> 00:20:23.412
considering your abilities.

00:20:24.782 --> 00:20:25.817
And despite that,

00:20:25.884 --> 00:20:28.122
you're allowing yourself
to become the object

00:20:28.188 --> 00:20:29.357
of people's scorn.

00:20:29.424 --> 00:20:30.861
You're forcing yourself
for my sake.

00:20:31.696 --> 00:20:32.664
Miyuki.

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:36.973
[Tatsuya] No one's twisting
my arm to make me be here.

00:20:37.674 --> 00:20:39.779
'Cause I know right now's
the only time

00:20:39.845 --> 00:20:41.849

a regular student alongside
my sister.

00:20:49.264 --> 00:20:50.867
Me, too, Brother.

00:20:55.376 --> 00:20:57.046
[Tatsuya] So on that note...

00:20:57.948 --> 00:21:01.789
Why don't we go back
to our ordinary lives for today?
