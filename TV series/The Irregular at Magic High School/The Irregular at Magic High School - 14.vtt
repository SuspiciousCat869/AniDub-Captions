<i>the Ichijou's Crimson Prince.</i>

00:10:15.029 --> 00:10:17.969
<i>A genius magician</i>
<i>who identified one</i>

00:10:18.035 --> 00:10:21.308

<i>to exist only in theory.</i>

00:10:21.877 --> 00:10:23.947

00:10:24.014 --> 00:10:25.150

<i>If there is one saving grace,</i>

00:10:45.991 --> 00:10:48.362
it's the fact that Rupture magic

[Boy] What's the status?

00:11:10.406 --> 00:11:11.643
[Miyuki] Brother!

00:11:11.943 --> 00:11:13.279
What?
Did something happen?

00:11:13.346 --> 00:11:14.281
[Tatsuya] An accident?

00:11:14.348 --> 00:11:16.586
Yeah,
if it can be called an accident.

00:11:16.653 --> 00:11:18.557
Miyuki,
no way that was accidental.

00:11:18.624 --> 00:11:22.030
That was deliberate foul play.
It's a clear rule violation.

00:11:22.397 --> 00:11:25.336
[Miyuki] Shizuku, it's too soon
to be jumping to conclusions

00:11:25.403 --> 00:11:27.642
and making bold statements.
After all,

00:11:27.708 --> 00:11:28.977
there's still no proof.

00:11:30.179 --> 00:11:32.417
Morisaki,
and the others?

00:11:32.885 --> 00:11:34.656
Critically injured.

00:11:35.089 --> 00:11:37.460
<i>[Mayumi] The match was held</i>
<i>in an Urban Arena.</i>

00:11:38.062 --> 00:11:40.634
And they were subjected
to a battering ram attack inside

00:11:40.701 --> 00:11:42.404
<i>a deserted building.</i>

00:11:43.172 --> 00:11:45.310
All three got buried under
the rubble.

00:11:46.111 --> 00:11:49.151
If Battering Ram is used indoors
with people inside,

00:11:49.218 --> 00:11:52.558
then that spell is elevated
to a lethal Rank A status.

00:11:53.192 --> 00:11:54.629
[Tatsuya] Way worse
than reckless surfing

00:11:54.696 --> 00:11:55.864
in Battle Board.

00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:58.169
I'd say it's clearly
a rule violation.

00:11:58.236 --> 00:11:59.872
Undeniably,

00:11:59.939 --> 00:12:01.308
but it wasn't
a complete disaster,

00:12:01.375 --> 00:12:03.246
so they just need to stay in
the hospital

00:12:03.312 --> 00:12:05.283
for the next three days
to recover.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.755
These circumstances
are rather murky, though,

00:12:07.822 --> 00:12:09.024
aren't they?

00:12:09.091 --> 00:12:10.426
[Tatsuya] Were all
three competitors inside

00:12:10.493 --> 00:12:11.896
of that same building?

00:12:11.963 --> 00:12:13.700
They got blitzed right
where they stood as soon

00:12:13.767 --> 00:12:15.169
as the match started up.

00:12:15.236 --> 00:12:16.806
That wouldn't work unless
the other team did

00:12:16.873 --> 00:12:18.376
some advance recon.

00:12:18.442 --> 00:12:20.413
[Shizuku] There's no question
that they're jumping the gun,

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.818
never mind using Battering Ram
was deliberate.

00:12:22.885 --> 00:12:24.656
Shizuku's right.

00:12:25.189 --> 00:12:26.660
I would assume
the tournament staff

00:12:26.726 --> 00:12:28.095
is sure to be panicked.

00:12:28.496 --> 00:12:30.433
Because they couldn't prevent
Fourth High from making

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.770
a false start?

00:12:31.836 --> 00:12:33.941
[Tatsuya] That's not really much
of an issue here,

00:12:34.007 --> 00:12:36.078
because a case could be made
the direct cause

00:12:36.145 --> 00:12:38.650
for this accident was the fact
that they set the starting point

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:41.723
of this match in a decrepit,
abandoned building.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.229
I would even dare to wager
the tournament staff wants

00:12:45.296 --> 00:12:47.535
to call off the rookie division
Monolith Code event.

00:12:47.602 --> 00:12:48.737
You're right.

00:12:48.804 --> 00:12:50.541
There were some calls
for cancellation.

00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:53.479
But preliminaries are going
to continue on without us

00:12:53.547 --> 00:12:54.816
and Fourth High anyway.

00:12:55.183 --> 00:12:56.385
[Mayumi] Worst case scenario,

00:12:56.452 --> 00:12:59.291
we'll have to forfeit
our second prelim match.

00:12:59.358 --> 00:13:01.261
I think it's already
the worst case.

00:13:01.328 --> 00:13:03.432
I don't see any other choice
but to forfeit.

00:13:04.201 --> 00:13:05.671
[Mayumi] Well, about that.

00:13:05.738 --> 00:13:07.440
Juumonji's negotiating
right now.

00:13:07.875 --> 00:13:09.177
Ah.

00:13:10.413 --> 00:13:11.650
So listen, Tatsuya.

00:13:11.716 --> 00:13:13.787
There's something I would like
to talk to you about,

00:13:13.854 --> 00:13:15.156
although...

00:13:16.893 --> 00:13:19.197
Maybe it's best we discuss it
in private?

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:23.105
Let me cut right to the chase.

00:13:24.474 --> 00:13:26.111
Do you want
to know what I think?

00:13:26.178 --> 00:13:29.117
If this most recent incident
was another act of sabotage

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:30.453
like what happened to Mari?

00:13:31.589 --> 00:13:32.892
Yeah.

00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.962
After Miss Watanabe sustained
her injuries,

00:13:35.029 --> 00:13:36.498
you did point out
the possibility

00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:38.837
her CAD had been tampered with,
didn't you?

00:13:38.904 --> 00:13:40.073
[Tatsuya] Yes.

00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:41.743
The Fourth High
technical staff swears

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:43.145
they didn't equip their CADs

00:13:43.212 --> 00:13:45.383
with any Battering Ram
sequences.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.320
As a result,
I can't help but wonder.

00:13:47.387 --> 00:13:48.990
If you're right that our school
is being targeted

00:13:49.057 --> 00:13:50.059
then what do you think

00:13:50.126 --> 00:13:51.596
the perpetrator's motive
could be?

00:13:53.032 --> 00:13:54.802
[Mayumi] Some sort of revenge,
maybe?

00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:57.140
Perhaps it's a form
of retaliation

00:13:57.207 --> 00:13:59.011
for what
we thwarted last spring?

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.918
No, this is separate
from the previous attack.

00:14:02.985 --> 00:14:05.189
Huh?
What makes you so sure?

00:14:05.256 --> 00:14:07.293
[Tatsuya] The night before
the tournament started,

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.500
some intruders tried
to sneak onto hotel property.

00:14:10.934 --> 00:14:12.203
<i>There were three in total,</i>

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:14.041
<i>and all of them were armed</i>
<i>with handguns.</i>

00:14:14.107 --> 00:14:15.711
<i>[Mayumi] Wow,</i>
<i>this is news to me.</i>

00:14:15.778 --> 00:14:17.748
<i>[Tatsuya] 'Cause I was sworn</i>
<i>to secrecy.</i>

00:14:18.416 --> 00:14:21.689
But I know their background
and just how shady it is.

00:14:22.323 --> 00:14:23.960
I hear it's
a criminal syndicate based

00:14:24.027 --> 00:14:25.063

[Man 2] Just as we planned.

the most points.

00:14:51.115 --> 00:14:53.219

00:17:10.393 --> 00:17:13.132
Well, Tatsuya,
you did good work today.

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:15.637
The results you produced
exceeded our expectations,

00:17:15.704 --> 00:17:16.873
so thank you.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.579
[Tatsuya] It's all thanks
to the players' efforts.

00:17:20.112 --> 00:17:21.649
Of course
it's their achievement, too,

00:17:21.716 --> 00:17:23.653
for working so hard.
Still though,

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.458
every single one of us here
recognizes how significant

00:17:26.526 --> 00:17:28.663
your contribution
to the team was.

00:17:29.765 --> 00:17:31.034
Thank you very much.

00:17:31.836 --> 00:17:32.972
[Mayumi] As it stands right now,

00:17:33.038 --> 00:17:34.942
First High has the most points,

00:17:35.009 --> 00:17:37.046
Third High is in second place,

00:17:37.113 --> 00:17:38.415
and in terms of just
the rookie events,

00:17:38.482 --> 00:17:40.286
they're 50 points behind us.

00:17:40.353 --> 00:17:42.625
Even if we withdraw
from Monolith Code now,

00:17:42.691 --> 00:17:44.327
we'd still be assured
of second place

00:17:44.394 --> 00:17:45.998
in the rookie division.

00:17:46.064 --> 00:17:47.701
Before
the rookie events started,

00:17:47.768 --> 00:17:50.172
I would have been satisfied
with that, but...

00:17:51.976 --> 00:17:53.513
Since we've come this far,

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.149
now I'd like to shoot
for first place

00:17:55.216 --> 00:17:56.385
in the rookie events, too.

00:17:58.122 --> 00:18:00.192
Did you know that Masaki
and Shinkurou

00:18:00.259 --> 00:18:02.196
will both be competing
for Third High School

00:18:02.263 --> 00:18:04.234
in the Monolith Code
event tomorrow?

00:18:04.301 --> 00:18:05.504
[Tatsuya] Yes.

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:06.873
<i>[Mayumi] With those two</i>
<i>teamed up,</i>

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.375
<i>there's little chance</i>
<i>they'd suffer</i>

00:18:08.442 --> 00:18:10.346
<i>an upset in this tournament.</i>

00:18:10.413 --> 00:18:11.481
[grunts]

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:13.218
[Mayumi] Therefore, Tatsuya...

00:18:15.356 --> 00:18:17.695
I would like to ask you
to compete in Monolith Code.

00:18:19.799 --> 00:18:20.968
Wait a second.

00:18:21.034 --> 00:18:22.871
I've got two questions for you.

00:18:23.138 --> 00:18:24.909
Oh?
What would those be?

00:18:25.309 --> 00:18:26.746
[Tatsuya] The two remaining
preliminary matches

00:18:26.813 --> 00:18:28.583
have been postponed
until tomorrow.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:29.719
Is that right?

00:18:29.785 --> 00:18:31.121
Yes, that is correct.

00:18:31.188 --> 00:18:33.125
In light of our
unfortunate situation,

00:18:33.192 --> 00:18:34.795
the NSC tournament
council agreed

00:18:34.862 --> 00:18:36.331
to change tomorrow's schedule.

00:18:36.398 --> 00:18:38.068
I was under
the impression players

00:18:38.135 --> 00:18:40.039
couldn't ever be replaced
even under

00:18:40.106 --> 00:18:42.511
the circumstance
of a debilitating injury.

00:18:42.878 --> 00:18:44.815
We pleaded our case
and they made an exception

00:18:44.882 --> 00:18:45.851
for that, too.

00:18:47.655 --> 00:18:50.661
My second question:
why was I chosen?

00:18:51.361 --> 00:18:52.531
Well, that's simple.

00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:53.867
It's because we all agreed
that you're

00:18:53.933 --> 00:18:56.104
the best substitute player
who's available.

00:18:56.773 --> 00:18:59.110
[Mari] Forget about your score
on the skill test.

00:18:59.177 --> 00:19:00.714
In terms of live combat skills,

00:19:00.781 --> 00:19:03.352
you're probably number one among
the first year guys.

00:19:03.419 --> 00:19:05.891
But Monolith Code
isn't considered live combat.

00:19:05.957 --> 00:19:08.262
It's a magical competition
where physical attacks

00:19:08.329 --> 00:19:09.464
are strictly banned.

00:19:09.532 --> 00:19:11.769
In terms of magic‐only
battle strength,

00:19:11.836 --> 00:19:13.707
I do think you're
in a special class

00:19:13.773 --> 00:19:14.842
all your own, Tatsuya.

00:19:14.909 --> 00:19:17.581
But I'm not a player.
I'm on technical staff.

00:19:17.915 --> 00:19:19.017
If you need a replacement,

00:19:19.084 --> 00:19:20.921
I'm certain there are plenty
of athletes entered

00:19:20.987 --> 00:19:23.325
in just a single event who would
be ready and willing.

00:19:23.392 --> 00:19:24.494
[Mari exhales]

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:27.400
Even if
the first course students' pride

00:19:27.467 --> 00:19:29.337
was taken out of the equation,

00:19:29.404 --> 00:19:32.176
selecting a player substitute
on the staff instead

00:19:32.243 --> 00:19:34.047
of the other players
would surely leave

00:19:34.114 --> 00:19:37.053
lasting psychological damage
on overlooked teammates.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.157
[grunts]

00:19:43.298 --> 00:19:44.668
‐ [Katsuto] Don't be
so childish.

00:19:44.735 --> 00:19:46.271
[gasping]

00:19:46.706 --> 00:19:48.242
You're already a member
of this team

00:19:48.308 --> 00:19:50.146
no matter what you believe,

00:19:50.614 --> 00:19:53.085
regardless of whether
it's as a player or tech staff.

00:19:53.152 --> 00:19:56.659
Don't forget you're one
of only 21 students chosen

00:19:56.726 --> 00:19:59.230
from among the 200 first years.

00:19:59.297 --> 00:20:02.638
And because First High School's
currently facing a crisis,

00:20:02.705 --> 00:20:05.242
our trusted team leader
Miss Saegusa here

00:20:05.309 --> 00:20:07.380
has chosen you
as the substitute.

00:20:07.447 --> 00:20:09.384
As long as you're a member
of this team,

00:20:09.451 --> 00:20:11.388
you will fulfill your duty
to it.

00:20:11.455 --> 00:20:12.591
Wait a minute.

00:20:12.658 --> 00:20:14.027
[Katsuto] Which means
that as a member,

00:20:14.094 --> 00:20:16.699
there will be no defying
our leader's decisions.

00:20:17.333 --> 00:20:20.574
And if you believe that one
of those decisions is flawed,

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.978
then trust that one of us‐‐
the leader's assistants‐‐

00:20:23.045 --> 00:20:24.247
will block it,

00:20:24.314 --> 00:20:26.351
but no member aside
from us reserves

00:20:26.418 --> 00:20:28.122
the right
to raise any objections.

00:20:28.188 --> 00:20:29.357
That's right.2

00:20:30.292 --> 00:20:31.963
No matter who they are.

00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:33.666
[gasps]

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:35.269
[Katsuto] Don't use your
second course status

00:20:35.336 --> 00:20:36.672
as a way out.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.514
Don't wallow in the ranks
of the weak, Shiba.

00:20:40.947 --> 00:20:42.250
Substitute or not,

00:20:42.316 --> 00:20:45.456
as long as you've been chosen,
you'll fulfill that mission.

00:20:47.126 --> 00:20:48.295
Very well.

00:20:48.362 --> 00:20:50.499
I shall indeed carry out
my duty.

00:20:50.567 --> 00:20:52.336
‐ [gasps]
‐ Mm.

00:20:52.403 --> 00:20:54.274
‐ [grunts]
‐ [Tatsuya] So,

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.344
who are the other team members
besides me?

00:20:56.712 --> 00:20:58.616
‐ [Katsuto] You get to choose.
‐ Huh?

00:20:58.683 --> 00:21:00.319
[Katsuto] The selection
of the other two members

00:21:00.386 --> 00:21:01.556
is left to you.

00:21:02.658 --> 00:21:03.993
If you need a little time,

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.398
then take an hour and come back
with the answer.

00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:09.003
[Tatsuya] No,
there's no need for that,

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.576
but I'm not sure
that they'll agree to do it.

00:21:11.642 --> 00:21:13.646
We'll be here if you need help
persuading them.

00:21:15.382 --> 00:21:17.253
Am I allowed to choose anyone,

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.558
even if they're students outside
the team?

00:21:19.625 --> 00:21:20.594
Huh?
I don't think that'd be very‐‐

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:21.796
‐ It's okay.
‐ [gasps]

00:21:21.863 --> 00:21:23.198
The tournament has already
made plenty

00:21:23.265 --> 00:21:24.568
of exceptions for this event.

00:21:24.635 --> 00:21:25.737
What difference would one

00:21:25.804 --> 00:21:27.641
or two more allowances
truly make?

00:21:27.708 --> 00:21:29.277
I don't know, Juumonji.

00:21:29.344 --> 00:21:30.514
Wonderful.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.518
My two picks
are Mikihiko Yoshida

00:21:32.584 --> 00:21:35.022
and Leonhard Saijou,
both of class 1E.

00:21:35.089 --> 00:21:36.358
That's ridiculous, Shiba!

00:21:36.424 --> 00:21:38.328
[grunting]

00:21:38.395 --> 00:21:39.832
Acceptable.

00:21:39.899 --> 00:21:40.967
So Tatsuya,

00:21:41.034 --> 00:21:43.071
it'd help us get on board
if you explained why

00:21:43.138 --> 00:21:44.340
you chose those two.

00:21:44.407 --> 00:21:45.944
[Tatsuya] Of course.

00:21:46.512 --> 00:21:49.484
The primary reason was that
I have hardly watched any

00:21:49.552 --> 00:21:52.123
of the mens' matches
or even their practice sessions.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:53.560
I essentially know next

00:21:53.626 --> 00:21:55.196
to nothing about
their specialties

00:21:55.262 --> 00:21:56.933
or characteristics.

00:21:56.999 --> 00:21:58.402
The match is tomorrow.

00:21:58.468 --> 00:22:00.039
If I research them from scratch,

00:22:00.105 --> 00:22:02.878
there wouldn't be enough time
to strategize or fine tune.

00:22:02.945 --> 00:22:05.115
[Mari] I take it you're familiar
with those two guys

00:22:05.182 --> 00:22:06.251
in particular, huh?

00:22:06.318 --> 00:22:07.521
Yes.

00:22:07.588 --> 00:22:09.357
Not only are Mikihiko Yoshida

00:22:09.424 --> 00:22:11.328
and Leonhard Saijou classmates
of mine,

00:22:11.394 --> 00:22:12.731
but I know them well, too.

00:22:12.798 --> 00:22:13.733
All right.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.937
A valid point.
After all,

00:22:16.004 --> 00:22:17.674
if the members of a team
don't know each other,

00:22:17.741 --> 00:22:19.678
then cooperation
can be difficult.

00:22:20.246 --> 00:22:21.549
[grunts]

00:22:21.849 --> 00:22:22.751
Tell me, though.

00:22:22.818 --> 00:22:24.254
[Mari] If that's
your primary reason,

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.524
then what's the secondary?

00:22:26.859 --> 00:22:28.262
Their abilities.
