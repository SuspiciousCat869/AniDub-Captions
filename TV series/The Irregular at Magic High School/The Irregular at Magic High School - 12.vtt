What are you talking about?

00:07:01.075 --> 00:07:02.912
[Mayumi] The reason
you lost your balance

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:05.083
just before catching
the Seventh High girl

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.755
must have been because
of an illegal spell cast

00:07:07.822 --> 00:07:10.393
by a third party which rippled
and chopped up

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.799
the water's surface.
Am I wrong?

00:07:12.865 --> 00:07:15.203
[grunts]
No, you're right.

00:07:15.605 --> 00:07:18.042
<i>[Mari] Just before my board</i>

00:07:18.109 --> 00:07:20.681
<i>I felt an unnatural swaying</i>
<i>beneath my feet.</i>

00:07:21.482 --> 00:07:23.119

00:07:23.186 --> 00:07:25.791
You lost your footing
only mere seconds after

00:07:25.858 --> 00:07:28.262
the water's surface
had fluctuated unnaturally.

00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:30.066
There is a discontinuity to it,

00:07:30.133 --> 00:07:33.239
one that is only seen
in phenomenon rewriting spells.

00:07:33.841 --> 00:07:35.845
[Mayumi] But I double checked,
and at the time,

00:07:35.911 --> 00:07:38.216
neither the Seventh High girl
nor the Ninth High girl

00:07:38.282 --> 00:07:40.220
were using that kind of magic.

00:07:40.721 --> 00:07:42.391
So that spell must
have been cast

00:07:42.457 --> 00:07:43.594
by a third party.

00:07:43.661 --> 00:07:46.032
Turns out Tatsuya agrees
with that, too,

00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:48.737
so he's borrowing the videos
from the tournament staff

<i>anything out?</i>

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.508
[Tatsuya] I've considered
every aspect of this.

00:08:07.575 --> 00:08:09.144
We definitely should look
at this

00:08:09.211 --> 00:08:11.248
as a possible
third party intervention.

00:08:11.315 --> 00:08:12.685
I gotta say, Shiba,

00:08:12.752 --> 00:08:14.522
it's impressive how quickly
you work.

00:08:15.357 --> 00:08:16.459
But even so,

00:08:16.526 --> 00:08:17.662
looks like this
is really gonna be

00:08:17.729 --> 00:08:19.131
a lot tougher than we thought.

00:08:19.298 --> 00:08:20.266
‐ [Kanon] Huh?
‐ Uh‐‐

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:21.235
[Kanon] What do you mean
by that?

00:08:21.302 --> 00:08:22.572
[grunts]

00:08:22.638 --> 00:08:24.441
This foul play confuses me.

00:08:24.743 --> 00:08:26.245
<i>[Kei] In order</i>
<i>to prevent outsiders</i>

00:08:26.312 --> 00:08:29.284
<i>from using interference magic</i>
<i>to mess with the athletes...</i>

00:08:29.986 --> 00:08:32.725
<i>The NSC has magicians skilled</i>
<i>in counter magic stationed</i>

00:08:32.792 --> 00:08:35.230
<i>at each arena posing</i>
<i>as committee members.</i>

00:08:35.296 --> 00:08:37.668
<i>They also have tons</i>
<i>of security cameras.</i>

00:08:39.773 --> 00:08:41.308
I was almost positive
that some sort

00:08:41.375 --> 00:08:43.714
of interference magic sequence
was launched from outside

00:08:43.781 --> 00:08:45.450
the surveillance network,

00:08:45.518 --> 00:08:46.987
but according
to Shiba's analysis,

00:08:47.054 --> 00:08:48.724
the force affecting
the liquid surface

00:08:48.791 --> 00:08:50.694
was generated from within
the water.

00:08:50.761 --> 00:08:52.732
<i>[Kei] The only</i>
<i>possible explanation</i>

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:54.936
would be that it was
an operative lurking underneath.

00:08:55.003 --> 00:08:55.938
[exhales]
[doorbell rings]

00:08:56.005 --> 00:08:57.542
‐ [gasps]
‐ [Tatsuya] Miyuki?

00:08:57.608 --> 00:08:58.911
[Miyuki] Got it.

00:09:00.514 --> 00:09:02.150
[door opens]
Let me introduce you.

00:09:02.217 --> 00:09:04.889
These are two of my classmates,
Yoshida and Shibata.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.229
I've asked them to come here
to help solve the riddle

00:09:08.296 --> 00:09:09.666
of the underwater operative.

00:09:10.033 --> 00:09:11.903
‐ [gasps]
‐ We're so happy to meet you.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.774
Hi, it's very exciting
to be working together.

00:09:13.841 --> 00:09:14.943
As I'm sure you already know,

00:09:15.009 --> 00:09:16.646
this is Kei Isori
and Kanon Chioda,

00:09:16.713 --> 00:09:17.648
both second years.

00:09:17.715 --> 00:09:18.884
It's our pleasure.

00:09:18.951 --> 00:09:20.621
It's good to be working
with you, too.

00:09:20.688 --> 00:09:22.023
So to bring you up to speed,

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:24.629
right now we're verifying
that Miss Watanabe

00:09:24.696 --> 00:09:26.499
was the victim
of illegal magic interference

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:27.735
by a third party.

00:09:29.171 --> 00:09:31.008
[Tatsuya] Just before she lost
her balance,

00:09:31.075 --> 00:09:33.947
the water's surface
caved inward unnaturally.

00:09:34.448 --> 00:09:36.787
This was almost certainly due
to magic interference

00:09:36.853 --> 00:09:38.423
from within the water.

00:09:39.258 --> 00:09:41.362
It's not possible to cast
a spell on the water

00:09:41.429 --> 00:09:44.001
from outside
of it without being detected.

00:09:44.736 --> 00:09:47.107
It's also unlikely it was caused
by delayed magic.

00:09:47.675 --> 00:09:49.612
And in that case,

00:09:49.679 --> 00:09:52.017
it is not impossible that
the spell was cast

00:09:52.083 --> 00:09:54.455
by somebody hiding underwater.

00:09:55.356 --> 00:09:58.597
It goes without saying that's
a preposterous theory.

00:09:58.664 --> 00:10:00.166
There's simply no way
to hide oneself

00:10:00.233 --> 00:10:03.272
in the water 100% either
with modern magic

00:10:03.339 --> 00:10:04.742
or ancient magic.

00:10:04.809 --> 00:10:06.680
So if that is true,

00:10:06.746 --> 00:10:09.151
then something other than
a human was lurking below

00:10:09.218 --> 00:10:10.420
in the waterway.

00:10:10.487 --> 00:10:12.057
That's the logical conclusion.

00:10:12.124 --> 00:10:14.161
If it wasn't a person
who cast it,

00:10:14.228 --> 00:10:15.931
then do you think it might
have been spirit magic?

00:10:15.998 --> 00:10:17.234
[grunts]

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.306
Spirit magic is Yoshida's area
of arcane expertise.

00:10:20.373 --> 00:10:22.845
Meanwhile, Shibata over here
has been gifted

00:10:22.912 --> 00:10:26.018
with extraordinary
visual sensitivity to Pushions.

00:10:26.085 --> 00:10:27.387
Mikihiko?

00:10:27.955 --> 00:10:30.226
Can spells be prepped
to only activate

00:10:30.293 --> 00:10:31.963
under certain conditions
and then cause

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.700
the water's surface to cave in?

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:36.272
Is that possible
with spirit magic?

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.608
I believe so.

00:10:37.675 --> 00:10:39.278
Could you pull it off?

00:10:39.746 --> 00:10:40.781
[Mikihiko] As long
as I'm familiar

00:10:40.848 --> 00:10:42.317
with the leylines
and topography,

00:10:42.384 --> 00:10:44.989
I can send in the spirits
through those leylines.

00:10:45.123 --> 00:10:45.925
That said,

00:10:45.991 --> 00:10:47.427
just casting that type
of spell

00:10:47.494 --> 00:10:50.066
wouldn't generate enough power
to matter in that scenario.

00:10:50.601 --> 00:10:52.972
Even if you manage to disrupt
the water's surface,

00:10:53.039 --> 00:10:54.709
that in itself wouldn't
be enough upheaval

00:10:54.776 --> 00:10:56.746
to knock Miss Watanabe
off balance.

00:10:58.082 --> 00:10:59.752
<i>If the Seventh High player</i>

00:10:59.819 --> 00:11:01.388
<i>hadn't accidentally</i>
<i>over‐accelerated,</i>

00:11:01.455 --> 00:11:02.758
<i>it would have been</i>
<i>no more harmful</i>

00:11:02.825 --> 00:11:04.529
<i>than a prank.</i>

00:11:05.063 --> 00:11:07.467
I'm beginning to doubt that
was just an accident as well.

00:11:07.535 --> 00:11:08.804
[all gasping]

00:11:08.871 --> 00:11:10.608
[computer beeping]
[Tatsuya] Come look at this.

00:11:11.041 --> 00:11:13.112
Normally, the Seventh High
competitor should

00:11:13.179 --> 00:11:15.350
have started decelerating
right around here.

00:11:16.352 --> 00:11:19.091
But in fact
she accelerated instead.

00:11:20.093 --> 00:11:21.596
You're right.
That is unusual.

00:11:21.663 --> 00:11:24.167
No athlete who could make such
a huge rookie mistake

00:11:24.234 --> 00:11:26.640
like that would ever be chosen
for the NSC.

00:11:26.706 --> 00:11:28.142
[Tatsuya] Therefore...
‐ [gasps]

00:11:28.777 --> 00:11:29.846
In all likelihood,

00:11:29.913 --> 00:11:32.050
her CAD must
have been tampered with.

00:11:33.352 --> 00:11:34.656
[Tatsuya] This
is the first place she would

00:11:34.722 --> 00:11:36.325
have needed to decelerate.

00:11:36.793 --> 00:11:40.400
If her sequence for deceleration
and acceleration were swapped,

00:11:40.466 --> 00:11:43.339
there's be an accident waiting
to happen right here.

00:11:44.074 --> 00:11:45.744
And then based upon
the lap times

00:11:45.811 --> 00:11:47.180
from last year's final...

00:11:47.848 --> 00:11:49.619
<i>One could foresee</i>
<i>that Miss Watanabe</i>

00:11:49.686 --> 00:11:52.357
<i>and the Seventh High player</i>
<i>would be in a dead heat</i>

00:11:52.424 --> 00:11:53.927
<i>as they made this turn.</i>

00:11:54.696 --> 00:11:57.367
<i>It stands to reason that</i>
<i>if I wanted to thwart them,</i>

00:11:57.434 --> 00:12:00.039
this would be my chance
to knock off both front runners

00:12:00.106 --> 00:12:01.710
<i>at once.</i>

00:12:02.912 --> 00:12:04.481
[Kei] I admit
that sounds logical.

00:12:04.549 --> 00:12:07.955
However, could somebody's CAD
really be tampered with?

00:12:08.022 --> 00:12:09.792
And if it really
was tampered with,

00:12:09.859 --> 00:12:11.362
then who would even do such
a thing?

00:12:11.428 --> 00:12:13.667
[Kanon] Could it be one
of Seventh High's engineers?

00:12:13.734 --> 00:12:16.706
[Tatsuya] While we can't
disregard that's a possibility,

00:12:16.773 --> 00:12:19.278
I believe it's more likely
that there's an operative among

00:12:19.344 --> 00:12:21.348
the tournament
committee members.

00:12:21.415 --> 00:12:22.384
[both gasping]

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.354
‐ Now wait a second, brother.
‐ [gasps]

00:12:24.421 --> 00:12:27.227
Just when and how exactly could
this person have tampered

00:12:27.294 --> 00:12:28.496
with her CAD?

00:12:28.864 --> 00:12:30.033
[Miyuki] All of the schools keep

00:12:30.099 --> 00:12:32.838
<i>their CADs under strict lock</i>
<i>and key.</i>

00:12:33.406 --> 00:12:35.009
[Tatsuya] There's just
one exception.

00:12:35.076 --> 00:12:36.913
All CADs are taken
from the schools

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.650
and handed over
to the committee.

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:40.019
[all gasping]

00:12:40.453 --> 00:12:41.790
<i>[Tatsuya] Even so,</i>

00:12:41.856 --> 00:12:44.829
<i>precisely how they messed</i>
<i>with it remains a mystery.</i>

00:12:45.597 --> 00:12:46.933
<i>Curious.</i>

00:12:54.114 --> 00:12:55.450
[crickets chirping]

00:12:55.517 --> 00:12:57.187
<i>[Mayumi] The two</i>
<i>official matches still left</i>

00:12:57.253 --> 00:13:00.093
to be played are Mirage Bat
and Monolith Code.

00:13:00.159 --> 00:13:02.364
To assure ourselves
of an overall victory,

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:03.900
we're gonna need
to take first place

00:13:03.967 --> 00:13:05.403
in both of those events.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.642
[Mari] Not only that but with
the additional burden

00:13:07.708 --> 00:13:10.346
of watching out for interference
by an unknown entity.

00:13:10.413 --> 00:13:11.683
[knocking]
[grunts]

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:12.885
The door's open.

00:13:13.887 --> 00:13:15.323
Pardon the interruption.

00:13:15.824 --> 00:13:17.093
[Mayumi] Have a seat, please.

00:13:19.732 --> 00:13:21.870
I asked you here because I need
to consult with you

00:13:21.936 --> 00:13:23.172
on something important.

00:13:23.239 --> 00:13:25.209
So could you please give them
the rundown, Rin?

00:13:26.111 --> 00:13:27.147
I believe you're both aware

00:13:27.213 --> 00:13:29.217
of the results
of today's matches.

00:13:29.284 --> 00:13:31.589
While it's true we suffered
an accident,

00:13:31.656 --> 00:13:35.129
our scores are more or less
in line with our projections.

00:13:35.698 --> 00:13:37.033
[Suzune] However,
since Third High

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.438
has been making greater gains
than we anticipated,

00:13:39.505 --> 00:13:42.210
our lead is less comfortable
than projected.

00:13:42.945 --> 00:13:44.147
As a result,

00:13:44.214 --> 00:13:46.285
should we fall drastically
behind Third High

00:13:46.352 --> 00:13:48.857
in the rookie events
that start tomorrow,

00:13:48.924 --> 00:13:51.395
then depending on our final
Mirage Bat score,

00:13:51.462 --> 00:13:54.802
it's unfortunately possible
that we'd be overtaken.

00:13:54.869 --> 00:13:58.142
Official points are worth twice
as much as rookie points,

00:13:58.209 --> 00:14:00.179
so we concluded it's in
our best interest

00:14:00.246 --> 00:14:03.419
to pour school resources
into the Mirage Bat event.

00:14:03.486 --> 00:14:05.657
Even if it's at the expense
of the rookie event,

00:14:05.724 --> 00:14:08.362
we need to do what's best
for the team strategically.

00:14:08.429 --> 00:14:09.832
[gasps]

00:14:09.899 --> 00:14:12.237
[Mayumi] Yes,
it is what you think.

00:14:12.303 --> 00:14:13.239
Miyuki?

00:14:13.305 --> 00:14:14.542
[gasps]

00:14:14.609 --> 00:14:17.414
First High is relying on you
to take over for Mari

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.019
and compete in the official
Mirage Bat event.

00:14:20.086 --> 00:14:22.390
Tatsuya, we'll need you
to continue on serving

00:14:22.457 --> 00:14:25.163
as Miyuki's CAD engineer
and then reporting

00:14:25.229 --> 00:14:27.100
to the arena on day nine
as well.

00:14:27.167 --> 00:14:28.570
But chairwoman,

00:14:28.637 --> 00:14:31.075
there are students older
than me who are participating

00:14:31.141 --> 00:14:33.547
in just one event.
It wouldn't be fair to them.

00:14:33.613 --> 00:14:35.483
[Miyuki] I don't understand why
you'd choose me

00:14:35.551 --> 00:14:37.087
as a replacement if you have
to take me out

00:14:37.153 --> 00:14:38.623
of the rookie event.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.026
'Cause we never had a backup.

00:14:40.093 --> 00:14:42.030
Only I did official Mirage Bat.

00:14:42.097 --> 00:14:43.032
[Miyuki gasps]

00:14:43.099 --> 00:14:44.502
So, that's the reason.

00:14:44.569 --> 00:14:46.806
There's way more of an upside
to players like you

00:14:46.873 --> 00:14:47.808
who trained in advance.

00:14:47.875 --> 00:14:49.478
[Mari] And besides,

00:14:49.545 --> 00:14:51.683
your little sister has what
it takes to win even

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.285
the official event, right?

00:14:53.352 --> 00:14:54.254
[gasps]

00:14:54.321 --> 00:14:55.524
‐ [Tatsuya] Possibly.
‐ [gasps]

00:14:55.591 --> 00:14:56.793
[both gasping]

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.563
Brother, wait.
Are you serious?

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:01.903
Since you all evaluated
my sister and me so highly,

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:03.540
I'll be certain
to give it my best

00:15:03.607 --> 00:15:05.042
as Miyuki's engineer.

00:15:05.744 --> 00:15:07.681
I believe in you, Miyuki.

00:15:07.748 --> 00:15:09.317
[gasps]

00:15:11.656 --> 00:15:13.125
[both giggling]

00:15:13.894 --> 00:15:16.031
[gasps]
Yes!

00:15:17.601 --> 00:15:20.039
[computers beeping]

00:15:20.106 --> 00:15:21.876
[Tatsuya] Honoka,
are you in the final race?

00:15:21.943 --> 00:15:23.045
Yes, I am,

00:15:23.112 --> 00:15:24.582
and since I'm racing
in the afternoon

00:15:24.649 --> 00:15:27.454
there won't be any overlap with
the girls' Speed Shooting event.

00:15:28.957 --> 00:15:30.026
We'll just have to hope

00:15:30.092 --> 00:15:31.529
the event goes off without
a hitch.

00:15:31.596 --> 00:15:32.665
Huh?

00:15:32.731 --> 00:15:34.067
[Tatsuya] Ah, it's nothing.

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:36.639
I've been concerned
about something, you see.

00:15:36.706 --> 00:15:39.311
What I'd really like to do
is check out your CAD.

00:15:39.377 --> 00:15:40.379
[gasps]

00:15:40.446 --> 00:15:41.415
[Tatsuya] But since
I can't do that...

00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:42.751
‐ [groans]
‐ [Tatsuya] I've decided

00:15:42.818 --> 00:15:44.287
to at least watch your race
from the sidelines.

00:15:44.354 --> 00:15:45.724
[gasps]
Really?

00:15:45.791 --> 00:15:46.826
[Honoka] You will?

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.663
I'll hold you to that.

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:49.832
Absolutely.

00:15:49.899 --> 00:15:54.107
[Honoka giggles]

00:15:56.713 --> 00:15:59.652
[computer beeping]

00:16:08.469 --> 00:16:10.072
Could you please look
at it thoroughly,

00:16:10.139 --> 00:16:12.043
just to be sure nothing
is wrong?

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:13.880
Right.
All good.

00:16:14.281 --> 00:16:15.951
[Shizuku] It's more comfortable
than my own.

00:16:16.018 --> 00:16:17.988
Is it, really?
What a relief.

00:16:18.055 --> 00:16:20.059
‐ [Shizuku] Hey, Tatsuya?
‐ Huh?

00:16:20.828 --> 00:16:21.930
To be clear,

00:16:21.996 --> 00:16:23.900
you don't want my family
to hire you?

00:16:24.467 --> 00:16:26.539
If you're relaxed enough
to joke around before

00:16:26.606 --> 00:16:28.510
your event starts,
you'll be fine.

00:16:28.577 --> 00:16:30.213
It's no joke.
I'm serious.

00:16:30.279 --> 00:16:31.950
You don't have to work
for us exclusively.

00:16:32.016 --> 00:16:33.219
[stammers]

00:16:33.285 --> 00:16:35.189
Like I have told you repeatedly,

00:16:35.256 --> 00:16:37.862
let's talk about it after
I get my license.

00:16:37.928 --> 00:16:39.197
[groans]

00:16:39.866 --> 00:16:41.301
Yeah, I understand.

00:16:41.903 --> 00:16:43.305
[exhales sharply]

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.644
[Tatsuya] Okay, Shizuku.
[chair creaks]

00:16:46.011 --> 00:16:47.113
‐ It's time.
‐ [gasps]

00:16:47.781 --> 00:16:49.084
[grunts]

00:16:49.317 --> 00:16:51.656
Best of luck.
Go make us proud.

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:54.327
[grunts]
Time to go all out.

00:16:56.031 --> 00:16:57.735
[indistinct chatter]

00:16:57.801 --> 00:16:58.904
[Miyuki] Is this seat free?

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:00.172
Oh, hey, Miyuki.

00:17:00.239 --> 00:17:01.275
Sure, it's available.

00:17:01.341 --> 00:17:02.811
Be my guest.
Sit down.

00:17:02.878 --> 00:17:04.180
Honoka?

00:17:04.247 --> 00:17:05.651
[Mizuki] Shouldn't you
be getting ready

00:17:05.717 --> 00:17:07.120
for your race today?

00:17:07.186 --> 00:17:08.823
What?
I have tons of time.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.827
My race isn't until later today.

00:17:11.495 --> 00:17:13.567
Honoka,
if you get worked up now,

00:17:13.633 --> 00:17:15.537
you won't be able
to last until your event.

00:17:15.604 --> 00:17:16.839
I know, right?

00:17:16.906 --> 00:17:18.543
But I can't help feeling
that way.

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:21.181
I'm sure you'll do wonderfully,
Honoka.

00:17:21.248 --> 00:17:22.918
‐ [exhales]
‐ [Miyuki] Didn't my brother say

00:17:22.985 --> 00:17:24.287
the same?

00:17:24.956 --> 00:17:26.425
We came to see this match
in order

00:17:26.491 --> 00:17:28.362
to take your mind off your race.

00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:31.101
So let's just root
for Shizuku for now.

00:17:31.536 --> 00:17:33.673
[Honoka] Okay.
You're right.

00:17:36.713 --> 00:17:38.315
[Mari] You know,
come to think of it,

00:17:38.382 --> 00:17:40.253
now is the first time
I'll be witnessing

00:17:40.319 --> 00:17:41.623
his engineering skills.

00:17:41.689 --> 00:17:43.593
At least in a real match.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.797
Yeah, I hadn't thought of that.
In my case,

00:17:45.864 --> 00:17:48.269
he really just helped me out
a little with moral support,

00:17:48.335 --> 00:17:50.641
so I must admit that
I'm very curious

00:17:50.707 --> 00:17:54.281
to see how a CAD he's fine‐tuned
from scratch will perform.

00:17:54.347 --> 00:17:56.451
Well,
starting with Miss Kitayama,

00:17:56.519 --> 00:17:58.289
he seems to be getting lots
of high praise

00:17:58.355 --> 00:17:59.759
from many athletes.

00:17:59.825 --> 00:18:00.594
<i>[Suzune] Apparently,</i>

00:18:00.661 --> 00:18:01.863
<i>some even went to the trouble</i>

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.568
of bringing their own CADs with
<i>them today.</i>

00:18:04.936 --> 00:18:06.271
<i>[Mari] Hey, wait a second.</i>

00:18:06.338 --> 00:18:08.108
<i>That could affect the matches,</i>
<i>couldn't it?</i>

00:18:08.409 --> 00:18:09.612
<i>[Suzune] No need to worry.</i>

00:18:09.679 --> 00:18:11.749
<i>It seems like</i>
<i>it's all under control.</i>

00:18:12.183 --> 00:18:14.588
<i>He'll be servicing them once</i>
<i>the matches are over.</i>

00:18:14.655 --> 00:18:15.891
<i>[Mayumi giggles]</i>

00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:18.462
<i>So he's steadily increasing</i>
<i>his fan base, huh?</i>

00:18:19.264 --> 00:18:20.734
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

00:18:20.801 --> 00:18:24.240
[buzzing]

00:18:24.909 --> 00:18:29.785
[beeping]

00:18:29.852 --> 00:18:32.758
[magical whirring]

00:18:37.233 --> 00:18:38.102
‐ That's crazy!
‐ [gasps]

00:18:38.168 --> 00:18:39.605
So amazing!

00:18:39.672 --> 00:18:41.843
[Mizuki] Could it possibly be
that she's designated

00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:45.149
the entire scoring area
as her magic activation zone?

00:18:45.216 --> 00:18:46.552
That's right!

00:18:46.619 --> 00:18:49.257
Shizuku is tagging all
solid substances inside

00:18:49.324 --> 00:18:50.994
the zone with vibrating
wave magic

00:18:51.061 --> 00:18:52.765
so she can shoot each target.

00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:54.602
[magic firing]

00:18:54.669 --> 00:18:56.839
The effective scoring area
in a Speed Shooting match

00:18:56.906 --> 00:18:57.908
is a cube.

00:18:57.975 --> 00:18:58.910
<i>[Suzune] This space measures</i>

00:18:58.977 --> 00:19:00.413
<i>50 feet on each side</i>

00:19:00.479 --> 00:19:02.016
<i>and is then placed in the air.</i>

00:19:02.083 --> 00:19:05.824
Shiba's activation sequence sets
<i>another cube inside of it</i>

00:19:05.891 --> 00:19:07.728
<i>measuring 30 feet</i>
<i>on each side,</i>

00:19:07.795 --> 00:19:10.834
<i>and the nine points comprised</i>
<i>of each of its vertices</i>

00:19:10.901 --> 00:19:14.174
and its center have been defined
<i>as epicenters.</i>

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.977
<i>Furthermore, each</i>
<i>of these points</i>

00:19:16.044 --> 00:19:18.282
<i>have been numbered</i>
<i>and then when that number</i>

00:19:18.349 --> 00:19:19.618
<i>is entered as a variable</i>

00:19:19.685 --> 00:19:21.723
<i>in the launched</i>
<i>activation sequence,</i>

00:19:21.789 --> 00:19:24.127
spear‐shaped virtual waves
will spread out

00:19:24.194 --> 00:19:25.429
from the epicenter.

00:19:25.496 --> 00:19:28.002
The coverage area of these waves
is 20 feet.

00:19:28.068 --> 00:19:29.204
<i>In other words,</i>

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:31.141
<i>activating</i>
<i>the magic sequence forms</i>

00:19:31.208 --> 00:19:35.049
<i>a spherical destruction space</i>
<i>with a radius of 20 feet</i>

00:19:35.116 --> 00:19:37.353
<i>and an epicenter</i>
<i>at its core.</i>

00:19:37.855 --> 00:19:40.359
<i>The player's position</i>
<i>and distance from the targets</i>

00:19:40.426 --> 00:19:42.163
<i>as well as the size</i>
<i>and placement</i>

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:45.169
<i>of the effective scoring area</i>
<i>all remain constant.</i>

00:19:45.236 --> 00:19:46.906
<i>Therefore, there is no need</i>

00:19:46.973 --> 00:19:49.377
<i>to enter variable coordinates</i>
<i>each time.</i>

00:19:49.444 --> 00:19:51.516
<i>Rather, you can specify</i>
<i>a number</i>

00:19:51.582 --> 00:19:53.520
<i>of your choosing</i>
<i>during activation</i>

00:19:53.586 --> 00:19:55.791
<i>and the magic sequence</i>
<i>will launch.</i>

00:19:55.857 --> 00:19:57.961
<i>The result is that,</i>
<i>in effect,</i>

00:19:58.028 --> 00:20:00.166
<i>the player only needs</i>
<i>to pull the trigger</i>

00:20:00.232 --> 00:20:01.936
<i>to destroy her targets.</i>

00:20:02.003 --> 00:20:03.840
[booming]

00:20:03.907 --> 00:20:06.044
[buzzing]

00:20:06.111 --> 00:20:07.748
[crowd cheering]
[exhales]

00:20:07.815 --> 00:20:09.985
[Suzune] The proper name
of this magic spell

00:20:10.052 --> 00:20:11.656
is Active Air Mine.

00:20:11.723 --> 00:20:14.294
Word on the street is that
it's a Shiba original.

00:20:14.829 --> 00:20:16.766
It's a complex
activation sequence

00:20:16.833 --> 00:20:17.701
so Miss Kitayama's

00:20:17.768 --> 00:20:19.672
processing power makes
it viable.

00:20:19.739 --> 00:20:20.907
In concept,

00:20:20.974 --> 00:20:23.445
it's the exact opposite
of your magic, Mayumi.

00:20:23.913 --> 00:20:27.621
I can't believe that he alone
came up with the sequence.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:30.059
[Tatsuya] You did great.

00:20:30.126 --> 00:20:31.696
A bit anticlimactic.

00:20:31.763 --> 00:20:33.432
I guess I was correct
in thinking they

00:20:33.499 --> 00:20:35.069
wouldn't go for the blind spots.

00:20:35.136 --> 00:20:36.606
Just as I expected,

00:20:36.672 --> 00:20:39.377
the settings for today's event
weren't too difficult at all.

00:20:39.444 --> 00:20:41.481
[Shizuku] Tatsuya,
you worry too much.

00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:44.053
We're still only
in preliminaries, you know?

00:20:45.022 --> 00:20:47.528
But from quarter finals on,
you'll be playing in match mode.

00:20:47.594 --> 00:20:49.397
‐ [grunts]
‐ I took the liberty

00:20:49.464 --> 00:20:51.602
of fine tuning your CAD earlier
this morning.

00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:52.771
‐ [gasps]
‐ So check out how

00:20:52.838 --> 00:20:53.973
it feels later.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.376
Got it.
Will do.

00:20:56.879 --> 00:20:58.550
<i>[Mayumi] So all three</i>
<i>of our first‐year girls</i>

00:20:58.616 --> 00:21:00.587
<i>made it to their next rounds.</i>

00:21:00.654 --> 00:21:03.560
And how is First High doing
in the Battle Board event?

00:21:03.626 --> 00:21:05.396
[Suzune] Two of the boys races
are over now,

00:21:05.463 --> 00:21:07.300
but they both missed the cut.

00:21:07.701 --> 00:21:09.237
We had one girl competing,
though,

00:21:09.304 --> 00:21:10.674
and she managed to qualify.

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:13.078
So that leaves us
with just one more guy.

00:21:13.145 --> 00:21:14.247
As for the girls,

00:21:14.314 --> 00:21:15.917
Miss Mitsui who's in
the final race

00:21:15.984 --> 00:21:17.654
will almost certainly
be qualifying.

00:21:18.255 --> 00:21:21.128
[Mayumi] We can't have Ah‐chan
letting up any time soon.

00:21:21.529 --> 00:21:22.531
<i>[Leonhard] Hmm.</i>

00:21:22.598 --> 00:21:23.900
<i>It might be a good idea for us</i>

00:21:23.967 --> 00:21:26.204
<i>to put more effort</i>
<i>into nurturing engineers</i>

00:21:26.271 --> 00:21:28.543
<i>at our school,</i>
<i>don't you think?</i>

00:21:29.945 --> 00:21:31.949
[Shizuku] Hey, Tatsuya,
is everything all right?

00:21:33.385 --> 00:21:34.454
[grunts]

00:21:34.522 --> 00:21:36.091
It's all good.

00:21:36.158 --> 00:21:37.594
[Tatsuya] As you already know,

00:21:37.661 --> 00:21:39.164
this is a totally
different model

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:40.767
than what you used in prelims.

00:21:41.234 --> 00:21:43.740
We're out of time,
but if you feel any discomfort,

00:21:43.807 --> 00:21:45.544
I'll adjust it as much
as possible,

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:46.779
so don't hold back.

00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:49.718
I feel no discomfort whatsoever.

00:21:49.785 --> 00:21:51.421
Actually,
it's such a perfect fit,

00:21:51.488 --> 00:21:52.825
it's almost creepy.

00:21:52.891 --> 00:21:54.562
‐ Is that right?
‐ [Shizuku] The others...

00:21:54.628 --> 00:21:56.398
‐ [gasps]
‐ The other two both won,

00:21:56.464 --> 00:21:57.500
didn't they?

00:21:57.568 --> 00:21:58.636
[Tatsuya] Yeah.

00:21:58.703 --> 00:22:01.341
Next is my turn for victory.

00:22:02.009 --> 00:22:03.245
No need to worry.

00:22:03.312 --> 00:22:04.615
If you perform
like you always do,

00:22:04.682 --> 00:22:06.351
there's no way you can't win.

00:22:07.153 --> 00:22:09.090
[grunts]
Of course I can

00:22:09.157 --> 00:22:11.529
since you've done everything
that's possible in order

00:22:11.596 --> 00:22:14.000
to pave the way to success
for me, Tatsuya.

00:22:14.434 --> 00:22:16.539
[Shizuku] All I have to do now
is win.

00:22:17.306 --> 00:22:19.310
There's no way
that I'm gonna lose.

00:22:19.377 --> 00:22:21.114
[Tatsuya] That's the spirit.
