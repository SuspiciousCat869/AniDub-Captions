[Tatsumi] So you're here, huh?

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:31.590
Chairman, today's patrol mission
is now complete.

00:08:31.656 --> 00:08:32.959
No arrests have been made.

00:08:33.026 --> 00:08:33.927
[groans]

00:08:33.994 --> 00:08:34.996
[Mari] Don't call me
big sister!

00:08:35.063 --> 00:08:36.967
How many times do I have
to tell you?

00:08:37.034 --> 00:08:38.737
That head of yours
an empty ornament?

00:08:38.804 --> 00:08:41.275
I'm sorry, chairman,
but please stop hitting me!

00:08:41.342 --> 00:08:42.578
[scoffs]

00:08:43.046 --> 00:08:43.814
[groans]

00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:45.483
By the way, chairman.

00:08:46.085 --> 00:08:47.855
Is that a new face
I see over there?

00:08:48.289 --> 00:08:50.728
[Mari] That's Tatsuya Shiba
of class 1E.

00:08:50.795 --> 00:08:53.232
He was recommended to us
by the student council.

00:08:53.667 --> 00:08:54.736
[Koutarou] Well...

00:08:56.172 --> 00:08:57.608
Emblemless, huh?

00:08:57.675 --> 00:08:59.913
[Sawaki] Tatsumi,
the way you phrased that may

00:08:59.979 --> 00:09:02.417
have run afoul
of the banned words regulations.

00:09:03.119 --> 00:09:06.425
In this instance,
please say course two student.

00:09:06.492 --> 00:09:07.795
Listen, you two.

00:09:07.862 --> 00:09:09.699
If you focus
on technical details,

00:09:09.766 --> 00:09:11.837
then you miss the big picture.

00:09:13.372 --> 00:09:15.110
This is just between us three.

00:09:15.176 --> 00:09:17.715
Hattori got himself royally
tripped up earlier today.

00:09:17.782 --> 00:09:18.917
[both gasping]

00:09:19.652 --> 00:09:21.088
Do you mean that...

00:09:21.556 --> 00:09:23.827
The new recruit defeated
Hanzou Hattori?

00:09:24.796 --> 00:09:25.898
[Mari] Yes, he did.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.302
In an official match.

00:09:29.304 --> 00:09:32.077
What the‐‐despite being
undefeated since enrollment,

00:09:32.144 --> 00:09:34.248
Hanzou was beaten
by a new kid?

00:09:34.749 --> 00:09:36.787
Nice.
Glad to have him on our side.

00:09:36.853 --> 00:09:38.891
He sure is something,
isn't he?

00:09:40.561 --> 00:09:41.763
Who would've thought?

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:43.700
[grunts]

00:09:45.805 --> 00:09:49.044
This high school
with its Bloom‐Weed labeling.

00:09:49.111 --> 00:09:51.817
<i>[Mari] Students are blinded by</i>
<i>a sense of superiority</i>

00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:54.689
<i>or drowned in a sense</i>
<i>of inferiority.</i>

00:09:56.693 --> 00:09:58.129
To tell you the truth,

00:09:58.196 --> 00:10:00.968
I've been getting fed up
with it all, personally.

00:10:01.035 --> 00:10:04.041
Fortunately, both Mayumi
and Jumonji

00:10:04.108 --> 00:10:06.445
of the extracurricular
activities federation know

00:10:06.513 --> 00:10:08.449
what kind of personality I have.

00:10:08.517 --> 00:10:10.286
So they put their
recommendations

00:10:10.353 --> 00:10:13.226
to good use and picked people
who are relatively free

00:10:13.292 --> 00:10:14.696
of those prejudices.

00:10:14.762 --> 00:10:17.935
Their sense of power may be
a bit inflated,

00:10:18.002 --> 00:10:20.975
but they're good guys
and they evaluate fairly.

00:10:22.712 --> 00:10:24.582
So I have a good feeling.

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:27.922
I think you'll fit in nicely
with the disciplinary committee.

00:10:29.391 --> 00:10:31.730
[footsteps]
[grunts]

00:10:32.965 --> 00:10:34.903
Koutarou Tatsumi,
class 3C.

00:10:35.738 --> 00:10:37.174
Welcome, Shiba.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.311
Able guys like you
are greatly valued here.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.585
Midori Sawaki,
class 2D.

00:10:42.952 --> 00:10:45.023
Happy to have you on board,
Shiba.

00:10:47.294 --> 00:10:48.296
[exhales]

00:10:49.966 --> 00:10:52.270
[Tatsuya] Class 1E.
Tatsuya Shiba.

00:10:53.206 --> 00:10:54.474
Likewise.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:56.746
It's a pleasure to meet you,
too.

00:11:04.796 --> 00:11:06.165
<i>[knocking]</i>

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:07.869
<i>[Tatsuya] Come in.</i>

00:11:08.737 --> 00:11:10.039
Excuse me.

00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:16.318
Um, brother, I...

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.356
Hey.
What's going on, Miyuki?

00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:21.663
Well, Tatsuya,
I was wondering,

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:23.834
could you recalibrate my CAD,
please?

00:11:26.238 --> 00:11:28.476
[Miyuki] Can we increase
the personal combat variations

00:11:28.544 --> 00:11:30.981
in the restrictive‐type
activation sequence?

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:33.954
It hit me during today's match.

00:11:34.221 --> 00:11:36.292
Spells emphasizing swiftness,

00:11:36.358 --> 00:11:39.566
rendering your foe powerless
despite dealing little damage.

00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:42.304
That's an area in which
I believe I fall short.

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:43.774
[Tatsuya] Hmm.

00:11:44.208 --> 00:11:46.378
You're able
to overwhelm your opponent

00:11:46.445 --> 00:11:47.882
with your magical powers.

00:11:48.282 --> 00:11:50.253
Don't you prefer conventional
fighting styles?

00:11:52.457 --> 00:11:54.261
You don't think I can do it?

00:11:55.163 --> 00:11:57.267
[chuckles]
All right, then.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.503
‐ [gasps]
‐ [Tatsuya] You won't have

00:11:58.570 --> 00:11:59.939
to consume your own magic.

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.477
Let me just reconfigure it.
[beeping]

00:12:17.909 --> 00:12:19.444
[whimpers]

00:12:27.962 --> 00:12:30.668
[computer beeping]

00:12:31.135 --> 00:12:33.272
[Tatsuya] That's it.
We're done.

00:12:34.542 --> 00:12:35.476
[grunts]

00:12:36.211 --> 00:12:37.347
[Miyuki exhales]

00:12:37.782 --> 00:12:41.088
[computer beeping]

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:46.265
[exhales]

00:12:47.635 --> 00:12:48.937
[gasps]

00:12:49.304 --> 00:12:50.440
[Miyuki] Brother.

00:12:51.342 --> 00:12:52.310
Miyuki!

00:12:53.412 --> 00:12:54.314
[Miyuki] It's so unfair!

00:12:55.618 --> 00:12:56.886
Here I stand next

00:12:56.953 --> 00:12:58.924
to you embarrassed
beyond belief,

00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:02.632
yet you remain so calm,
as always.

00:13:02.698 --> 00:13:05.537
[Tatsuya] No, wait.
Miyuki, hold on.

00:13:06.105 --> 00:13:08.510
Or maybe it's because
you don't like

00:13:08.577 --> 00:13:09.879
to think of me as a girl?

00:13:09.946 --> 00:13:12.050
[Tatsuya] And it's a good thing
that I don't.

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:16.191
[Miyuki] So do you find women
like Miss Saegusa attractive?

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:20.934
Or do you prefer someone like,
say, Miss Watanabe?

00:13:21.335 --> 00:13:23.607
It's just that you seem
to have the time

00:13:23.674 --> 00:13:25.143
of your life talking to them.

00:13:25.844 --> 00:13:27.113
You were listening?

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:28.817
[Miyuki] Oh, I knew it!

00:13:29.552 --> 00:13:31.823
I mean, they certainly
are gorgeous, aren't they?

00:13:32.658 --> 00:13:33.994
You've gotta be kidding.

00:13:34.562 --> 00:13:36.566
Don't you think you're
misreading this, huh?

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.071
Brother, for having
such lecherous thoughts

00:13:39.137 --> 00:13:41.976
while being surrounded
by beautiful upper class women,

00:13:42.043 --> 00:13:43.446
you're being punished!

00:13:49.458 --> 00:13:51.328
<i>[Tatsuya] Self‐repair</i>
<i>invocation,</i>

00:13:51.395 --> 00:13:52.430
<i>auto start.</i>

<i>Complete.</i>

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:15.109
Good morning, brother.
I hope that you slept well.

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.652
Did I perhaps do something
last night

00:14:19.719 --> 00:14:21.055
that offended you, Miyuki?

00:14:21.121 --> 00:14:22.591
[Miyuki] Oh, please forgive me.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.998
It was a prank
that went too far.

00:14:27.702 --> 00:14:29.004
Oh, give me a break.

00:14:31.976 --> 00:14:33.379
<i>[Mari] Once again this year,</i>

00:14:33.446 --> 00:14:36.318
a week of unbridled shenanigans
has arrived.

00:14:36.385 --> 00:14:38.790
Obtaining talented members
is crucial

00:14:38.857 --> 00:14:42.230
and directly influences
the power map of each club.

00:14:42.297 --> 00:14:44.401
Unfortunately,
it is not uncommon

00:14:44.468 --> 00:14:46.305
for this mad scramble
to degenerate

00:14:46.371 --> 00:14:48.042
into no holds barred
fist fights,

00:14:48.109 --> 00:14:50.146
or even magic shoot‐outs.

00:14:50.781 --> 00:14:52.083
Luckily, though,

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.789
we replaced our departing
graduates just in time.

00:14:54.856 --> 00:14:56.893
Now for introductions.
Stand up.

00:14:59.164 --> 00:15:02.738
Shun Morisaki of 1A
and Tatsuya Shiba of 1E

00:15:02.805 --> 00:15:05.343
will be joining
the patrol detail right away.

00:15:06.145 --> 00:15:07.480
They gonna be useful?

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:09.484
Don't worry about that.

00:15:09.552 --> 00:15:11.488
Both recruits
are highly competent.

00:15:12.023 --> 00:15:14.996
I already observed
Shiba's skills up close.

00:15:15.062 --> 00:15:17.568
Morisaki wields
a pretty mean device as well.

00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:20.908
Is there anything else
that we need to discuss, then?

00:15:25.617 --> 00:15:27.153
All right, so be it.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.124
This meeting is now adjourned.

00:15:29.725 --> 00:15:30.994
Mobilize!

00:15:33.533 --> 00:15:34.936
[Boy] Let's go.

00:15:35.002 --> 00:15:36.973
[Boy 2] Where should
we start today?

00:15:38.109 --> 00:15:39.979
[Mari] First off,
let me give you these.

00:15:40.948 --> 00:15:42.985
Also, about the CADs.

00:15:43.419 --> 00:15:45.189
Active duty officers
are permitted

00:15:45.256 --> 00:15:47.193
to carry them on school grounds.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.630
You're free to use them,

00:15:48.697 --> 00:15:50.767
and there's no need
to request anyone's permission

00:15:50.834 --> 00:15:52.003
in advance.

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:55.443
However, if we find you've
abused them in any way,

00:15:55.511 --> 00:15:57.280
you will be relieved
of your post

00:15:57.347 --> 00:15:59.719
and the student body
will then punish you harshly.

00:16:00.754 --> 00:16:02.190
So don't take this lightly.

00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:03.994
I have a question.

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.196
Go ahead.

00:16:05.263 --> 00:16:07.133
About the committee's equipment.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.337
Are we allowed
to use that as our CADs?

00:16:09.404 --> 00:16:13.179
Uh, well, it is allowed,
but it's pretty outdated.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.016
[scoffs]

00:16:16.151 --> 00:16:18.455
The stuff does seem
rather antiquated,

00:16:18.523 --> 00:16:20.661
but it's also calibrated
for experts.

00:16:20.894 --> 00:16:22.163
[Tatsuya] They all are.

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.569
Well, in that case,
by all means, borrow them.

00:16:24.635 --> 00:16:27.808
They were sitting on that shelf
collecting dust anyway.

00:16:28.108 --> 00:16:29.377
[Tatsuya] Okay, then.

00:16:29.444 --> 00:16:31.014
I plan on using these two.

00:16:31.081 --> 00:16:32.083
[grunts]

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:33.452
[Mari] Two of them?

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.091
You really are
an interesting one,

00:16:36.158 --> 00:16:37.393
aren't you?

00:16:43.807 --> 00:16:45.176
[Shun] Hey!

00:16:47.982 --> 00:16:49.417
[Tatsuya] What is it?

00:16:49.484 --> 00:16:51.623
There's no way you can activate
your magic like that.

00:16:51.689 --> 00:16:53.894
You can't use them
simultaneously.

00:16:54.361 --> 00:16:55.964
You're nothing
but course two scum,

00:16:56.031 --> 00:16:58.035
so get over yourself already!

00:17:02.645 --> 00:17:05.551
[indistinct chatter]

00:17:09.825 --> 00:17:11.963
[Erika] Uh, could you get
your hands off me, please?

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:13.132
[gasps]

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:14.535

00:17:15.971 --> 00:17:16.973
[Girl 2] No, don't listen
to her!

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.142
You'll definitely like
our club better.

00:17:18.209 --> 00:17:20.012
Whoa, that's enough!
Let go of her arm.

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:21.749
Hey, watch where
you're touching me!

00:17:21.816 --> 00:17:23.052

[grunts]

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:56.418
Did you see?

00:17:57.655 --> 00:17:59.825
Just a glimpse.
I'm sorry.

00:18:00.627 --> 00:18:01.763
[Erika] Pervert!

00:18:01.829 --> 00:18:03.065
[shudders]

00:18:03.132 --> 00:18:05.369
Well, if you really are sorry...

00:18:05.871 --> 00:18:08.375
Then come keep me company
after this, all right?

00:18:09.377 --> 00:18:10.714
[Sayaka shouts]

[Tatsuya] I take it you're
not exactly thrilled.

00:18:17.962 --> 00:18:20.667
It's just that it's so boring
trying so hard

00:18:20.734 --> 00:18:22.638
to look good sparring
and then delivering

00:18:22.705 --> 00:18:24.040
a pre‐determined blow.

00:18:24.107 --> 00:18:25.877
It's a staged sword fight.

00:18:25.944 --> 00:18:27.715
It's a public exhibition.

00:18:28.148 --> 00:18:29.417
Isn't that what it should be?

00:18:30.019 --> 00:18:32.156
[Tatsuya] It's something
you can't demonstrate for real.

00:18:33.092 --> 00:18:34.795
A true martial arts battle...

00:18:35.296 --> 00:18:37.433
is two people killing
each other.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:38.637
[grunts]

00:18:38.837 --> 00:18:39.772

I guess I'm not invested.

[both grunting]

[all gasping]
Hmm?

00:18:45.517 --> 00:18:47.521
[Tatsuya] Looks like trouble.

00:18:48.255 --> 00:18:49.792
There's still more than
an hour left before

00:18:49.859 --> 00:18:52.196
the Kenjitsu club's even up,
Kirihara.

00:18:52.263 --> 00:18:54.635
Why can't you just wait
your turn, huh?

00:18:55.202 --> 00:18:57.106
[Takeaki] Not what I expected,
Mibu.

00:18:57.407 --> 00:18:58.843
Since you can't put
your abilities

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.315
on display sparring
with a rank newbie...

00:19:01.883 --> 00:19:04.254
I thought a collaboration
was in order here.

00:19:04.321 --> 00:19:05.757

You're the one who forced him

00:19:05.824 --> 00:19:07.226
to challenge you.

00:19:07.293 --> 00:19:08.930
Collaboration, my foot!

00:19:08.997 --> 00:19:10.299
Hmm.

00:19:10.366 --> 00:19:12.705
Oh, but it was the kendo club
who struck first.

00:19:12.771 --> 00:19:15.209
Only 'cause you provoked us,
Kirihara.

00:19:15.711 --> 00:19:18.082
This is starting to get juicy,
huh?

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:20.219
Do you know those two, Erika?

00:19:20.286 --> 00:19:22.691
I don't really know
either personally but...

00:19:22.758 --> 00:19:23.827
[grunts]

00:19:23.893 --> 00:19:25.897
[Erika] The girl's name
is Sayaka Mibu.

00:19:26.198 --> 00:19:27.735
Two years ago she placed second

00:19:27.801 --> 00:19:30.272
in the national junior high
girls' kendo tournament.

00:19:31.308 --> 00:19:33.747
The smug dude
is Takeaki Kirihara.

00:19:33.813 --> 00:19:36.351
Two years ago he won
the Kanto‐region junior high

00:19:36.418 --> 00:19:37.888
kenjutsu tourney.

00:19:38.455 --> 00:19:40.761
Oh, seems like
the real fight's about to start.

00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:43.298
[Takeaki] No need to worry,
Mibu.

00:19:43.365 --> 00:19:44.869
This is only kendo.

00:19:44.935 --> 00:19:47.574
I'll do you a favor
and not use any magic.

00:19:48.175 --> 00:19:50.714
[Sayaka] You think you stand
a chance with just sword skills?

00:19:50.781 --> 00:19:53.085
You, who comes
from the spell‐dependent

00:19:53.152 --> 00:19:54.622
kenjutsu club,

00:19:54.688 --> 00:19:56.458
whereas I come
from the kendo club

00:19:56.526 --> 00:19:58.462
where we focus solely
on swordplay.

00:19:58.997 --> 00:20:01.602
Oh, you focus solely
on honing swordplay?

00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:03.873
You're way too full of it, Mibu.

00:20:04.274 --> 00:20:05.644
[Takeaki] I'll be happy
to show you.

00:20:05.711 --> 00:20:08.115
Show you a dimension well beyond
the limits

00:20:08.182 --> 00:20:09.350
of mere physical ability.

00:20:10.152 --> 00:20:11.756
Show you the skills of kenjutsu!

00:20:14.227 --> 00:20:15.564
[blow lands]

00:20:18.703 --> 00:20:19.872
A stalemate?

00:20:19.939 --> 00:20:21.709
No, it's far from equal.

[grunts]

00:20:25.382 --> 00:20:26.953
[Sayaka] That would
have been fatal.

00:20:27.721 --> 00:20:29.992
Your strike stopped just short
of the bone.

00:20:31.128 --> 00:20:32.798
Now, accept your defeat.

00:20:33.465 --> 00:20:34.835

Mibu, is that what you want,
to fight with real swords?

00:20:43.018 --> 00:20:45.322
[Takeaki] If so
then I'll oblige you.

00:20:45.389 --> 00:20:47.928
I'll show you what I can do
with a true blade!
