Miyuki, what type of spell
was Tatsuya casting?

00:05:39.378 --> 00:05:40.815
[Maki] Healing magic, right?

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.119
Well, no.

00:05:43.186 --> 00:05:44.154
What my brother had used

00:05:44.221 --> 00:05:46.158
wasn't exactly healing magic.

00:05:46.693 --> 00:05:49.231
The name of that spell
he launched is Regrowth.

00:05:49.298 --> 00:05:51.369
Going back in time up
to 24 hours,

00:05:51.435 --> 00:05:53.006
he makes a full copy
of the Eidos

00:05:53.072 --> 00:05:54.709
before sustaining injury.

00:05:54.776 --> 00:05:57.414
This copy is overwritten onto
the current data

00:05:57.481 --> 00:05:59.719
as a magic sequence restoring
the Eidos

00:05:59.786 --> 00:06:01.389
to a state before
the injury occurred.

[all gasping]

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:04.996
Wait, does that mean
Tatsuya possesses

00:06:05.063 --> 00:06:07.869
the capability to heal any sort
of wound in one go?

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:11.342
He doesn't heal people
in just one go, Mr. Yoshida.

00:06:12.044 --> 00:06:13.479
In one instant.

00:06:13.981 --> 00:06:16.687
His targets aren't restricted
to organic matter.

00:06:17.087 --> 00:06:19.626
Whether it's a human being
or machine,

00:06:19.693 --> 00:06:21.663
he has the power
to restore any creature

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.001
or object in a single instant.

00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:26.740
[Miyuki] Due to the special kind
of wizardry,

00:06:26.807 --> 00:06:30.447
my brother's unable to wield
any other incantations freely.

00:06:30.815 --> 00:06:33.587
His magic calculation area
is governed by the strain

00:06:33.654 --> 00:06:35.925
of this godlike power,
and as a result,

00:06:35.992 --> 00:06:39.431
he has zero capacity
for other magic.

00:06:39.498 --> 00:06:41.570
I guess that explains
why Tatsuya's skills

00:06:41.637 --> 00:06:42.772
are so unbalanced.

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:43.908
I see.

00:06:43.974 --> 00:06:46.479
He's keeping such
high level magic on standby

00:06:46.546 --> 00:06:48.449
so it's no wonder
that other sequences

00:06:48.517 --> 00:06:49.653
would get blocked.

00:06:50.053 --> 00:06:50.955
[grunts]

00:06:51.022 --> 00:06:53.527
No way!
That's beyond incredible!

00:06:53.594 --> 00:06:55.698
If it was sustained within
a day or less,

00:06:55.765 --> 00:06:58.303
any injury could be healed
as though it never happened?

00:06:58.369 --> 00:06:59.739
Amazing.

00:06:59.806 --> 00:07:01.510
Think of the demand
for such a skill.

00:07:01.576 --> 00:07:02.979
Just imagine,

00:07:03.046 --> 00:07:05.651
he could save thousands
or even millions of lives.

00:07:05.718 --> 00:07:07.855
That's right.
Compared to working miracles,

00:07:07.922 --> 00:07:09.526
not being able
to employ other spells

00:07:09.592 --> 00:07:10.962
is only a minor trade off.

00:07:11.028 --> 00:07:12.264
[Erika] Why does Tatsuya
keep such

00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:13.767
a wonder power a secret?

00:07:13.834 --> 00:07:15.070

a spell that strong...

00:07:20.113 --> 00:07:22.919
You think he can cast it
without paying a dear price?

00:07:22.986 --> 00:07:24.188
[both gasping]

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:28.964
To rewind the Eidos change log
so he can make a full copy,

00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:31.202
the information inside
that data set

00:07:31.268 --> 00:07:33.172
must be read in its entirety.

00:07:33.239 --> 00:07:34.876
[Miyuki] It goes without saying,

00:07:34.943 --> 00:07:36.546
that includes
the pain experienced

00:07:36.613 --> 00:07:37.715
by the injured party.

00:07:37.782 --> 00:07:38.550
Oh!

00:07:38.617 --> 00:07:40.020
Not only that,

00:07:40.086 --> 00:07:42.692
it's transmitted
in condensed form.

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:46.332
Which means from the time
that Isori was injured today

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:48.671
until my brother cast his spell,

00:07:48.737 --> 00:07:51.543
I would estimate only half
a minute had gone by.

00:07:51.977 --> 00:07:53.781
[Miyuki] Whereas the time
my brother spent

00:07:53.847 --> 00:07:56.553
reading Isori's Eidos
change log amounted

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.824
to approximately .2 seconds.

00:07:59.993 --> 00:08:01.930
In that single blink of an eye,

00:08:01.997 --> 00:08:05.370
my poor brother's mind
experienced 150 times

00:08:05.437 --> 00:08:09.278
the pain and suffering felt
by Isori all condensed.

Understand that every time

00:08:14.723 --> 00:08:16.727
my brother heals
somebody's wounds,

00:08:16.793 --> 00:08:19.498
that is the price
his psyche pays.

00:08:20.133 --> 00:08:21.703
I ask you,

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.074
should he still use
his power for others despite

00:08:24.141 --> 00:08:25.578
how much it hurts him?

[Chen] Miyuki Shiba.

00:12:02.979 --> 00:12:05.651
If you know who I am
then it's clear that you

00:12:05.718 --> 00:12:07.755
must be the one who
has been persistently following

00:12:07.822 --> 00:12:09.659

00:12:09.726 --> 00:12:11.830
What are you doing here, kid?

00:12:11.896 --> 00:12:14.368
How could my spell not
have worked on you?

00:12:14.869 --> 00:12:16.272
I knew what to expect.

00:12:16.338 --> 00:12:18.710
I was told not to lose
my bearings.

00:12:18.777 --> 00:12:20.648
If I'm being honest with you,

00:12:20.714 --> 00:12:22.919
that alone meant
basically nothing to me.

00:12:22.985 --> 00:12:25.991
[Miyuki] Nevertheless,
I took great care.

00:12:26.058 --> 00:12:29.131
I thought if I was wary
of all four cardinal directions

00:12:29.197 --> 00:12:31.068
that I would somehow manage.

00:12:31.135 --> 00:12:32.304
[grunts]

00:12:32.605 --> 00:12:34.074
Fortunately for me,

00:12:34.141 --> 00:12:36.813
there's a magician on my side
who can see the invisible.

00:12:37.247 --> 00:12:39.519
And even though your spell
may be transparent

00:12:39.585 --> 00:12:40.788
to the human eye,

00:12:40.854 --> 00:12:42.591
she still managed
to see you.

00:12:42.658 --> 00:12:44.094
Therefore,

00:12:44.161 --> 00:12:46.365
since you're
the one who's spying on us,

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:48.469
we'll rest assured
for the time being.

00:12:48.537 --> 00:12:51.342
As long as we make
you vanish without a trace.

[Miyuki] Don't worry.
I have improved my technique.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.900
So there's no danger of you not
waking up once you've gone.

[Kyouko] More or less done.

00:14:34.515 --> 00:14:36.619
There's still a bit
of sporadic fighting going on

[Man scoffs]
As if those people had the guts.

Perhaps they feared causing
a hydrazine spill.

00:16:31.181 --> 00:16:32.685
The same difference.

00:16:32.751 --> 00:16:35.323
The Japanese self defense force
is so caught up

00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:37.427
in their hypocritical concern
for the environment

00:16:37.493 --> 00:16:39.364
that they'll allow
the enemy to retreat.

00:16:39.732 --> 00:16:41.034
Don't ever forget this.

00:19:21.088 --> 00:19:22.591
[beeping]

00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:28.202
<i>Oh, brother.</i>

00:19:30.439 --> 00:19:31.843
As we anticipated,

00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:34.815
the enemy fleet is now preparing
to go into battle.

00:19:34.882 --> 00:19:37.487
Take a look at this image.
[whirring]

00:19:37.554 --> 00:19:39.859
[Harunobu] This was taken
five minutes ago.

00:19:39.925 --> 00:19:41.495
If our estimation is correct,

00:19:41.562 --> 00:19:44.602
the enemy will leave their port
within the next two hours.

00:19:44.668 --> 00:19:46.104
Unfortunately,

00:19:46.171 --> 00:19:49.678
the Great Asian Alliance's fleet
is already finished mobilizing

00:19:49.745 --> 00:19:52.951
whereas our navy just started
to do so yesterday.

00:19:53.018 --> 00:19:54.387
At this point,

00:19:54.454 --> 00:19:57.026
our only option is to engage
the enemy's naval forces

00:19:57.093 --> 00:19:58.930
with land‐
and air‐based firepower.

00:19:58.997 --> 00:20:00.834
We're in for a bitter fight.

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:03.707
Therefore,
to overcome the situation,

00:20:03.773 --> 00:20:06.546
a strategic‐class magician
will be deployed

00:20:06.612 --> 00:20:11.054
by the Magic Battalion
to destroy the Alliance's fleet.

00:20:11.121 --> 00:20:12.725
Those are the orders.

00:20:12.791 --> 00:20:14.929
This operation has already
been approved

00:20:14.995 --> 00:20:16.632
by the joint staff council.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.182
[buzzing]

00:20:25.449 --> 00:20:27.019
Special officer Oguro,

00:20:27.086 --> 00:20:28.222
are you ready now?

00:20:28.288 --> 00:20:29.491
[Tatsuya] Ready to go.

00:20:29.558 --> 00:20:31.863
The satellite link
is also working well.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:34.668
Agent, prepare to activate
Material Burst‐‐

00:20:34.735 --> 00:20:36.939
the mass energy conversion
magic spell.

00:20:58.081 --> 00:20:59.985
Preparations complete.

00:21:01.087 --> 00:21:03.292
Material Burst, activate!

00:21:03.358 --> 00:21:05.897
[magical whooshing]

00:21:05.964 --> 00:21:07.200
Now activating.

00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:09.237
Material Burst.

00:21:09.304 --> 00:21:12.443

[booming]

00:21:38.395 --> 00:21:39.732
Update.

00:21:40.366 --> 00:21:41.969
The enemy fleet's
been wiped out.

00:21:42.036 --> 00:21:43.272
No.

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:45.944
Demolished.

00:21:52.858 --> 00:21:54.562
<i>A massive magical explosion‐‐</i>

00:22:07.955 --> 00:22:10.560
<i>It marked the ascension</i>

<i>atomic,</i>
<i>biological,</i>

00:22:11.996 --> 00:22:14.835
<i>and chemical weapons</i>

00:22:20.814 --> 00:22:23.185
<i>And for the breed known</i>

00:22:23.252 --> 00:22:26.692

[Tadanori] Pardon me,
Miss Yotsuba,

00:23:26.044 --> 00:23:28.248
but we just received word
from Major Kazama.

00:23:28.315 --> 00:23:30.987
He wishes to come over
and brief you next Sunday.

Well, why don't we have Miyuki

and Tatsuya visit us
that day as well?
