In terms of talent,

For top secret missions,

the one more likely to go

is a semi‐professional rather
than a jaded veteran.

00:02:33.507 --> 00:02:36.312
[Tatsuya] It's safer
to have them do side jobs.

Besides,
it may be unethical,

[Retsu] Your subordinate
Tatsuya Shiba.

The child you plucked

00:04:37.856 --> 00:04:39.993
from the Yotsubas
three years ago.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.565
He's Miya Shiba's son.

<i>Surely it should come</i>
<i>as no surprise</i>

<i>Even if only temporarily,</i>

<i>Miya and his and Maya</i>
<i>were both students of mine.</i>

In that case,
you should be well aware.

00:04:56.994 --> 00:05:00.000
His clan still
has not released Tatsuya

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:01.302
from their familial claim.

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:03.574
[Retsu] Don't you consider that
a waste?

00:05:04.543 --> 00:05:06.245
What do you mean by waste?

00:05:06.747 --> 00:05:09.619
<i>[Retsu] Along with Masaki,</i>
<i>scion of the Ichijou clan,</i>

in our country's magical forces.

00:05:14.663 --> 00:05:16.767
Wouldn't you agree that it's
a waste of potential

00:05:16.834 --> 00:05:18.938
to consign such
an elite talent as his

00:05:19.004 --> 00:05:21.543
to private bodyguard duties,
hmm?

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.448
[Harunobu] Your Excellency,
pardon my bluntness,

00:05:24.516 --> 00:05:26.452
but do you wish to weaken
the Yotsubas?

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:29.258
At this rate,

00:05:29.325 --> 00:05:31.495
their clan will become
too powerful.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.834
[Retsu] Unless measures
are taken to curtail them,

00:05:33.901 --> 00:05:37.174
they might surpass
the Ten Master Clans altogether.

00:05:37.542 --> 00:05:39.880
Solely in terms
of their combat power,

00:05:39.946 --> 00:05:41.048
You are correct.

00:05:41.115 --> 00:05:43.219
The Yotsuba family is head
and shoulders above

00:05:43.286 --> 00:05:45.290
the country's
other master clans.

00:05:45.357 --> 00:05:47.427
I fear I can't allow that.

00:05:48.062 --> 00:05:50.400
<i>[Retsu] The Yotsubas think</i>
<i>of themselves as weapons.</i>

00:05:50.467 --> 00:05:52.972
Their members embrace that role.

00:05:53.541 --> 00:05:55.143
And although it's true
that magicians

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.116
were originally cultivated
as living weapons,

00:05:58.182 --> 00:06:02.090
they will eventually be ejected
from the world of mankind.

00:06:07.067 --> 00:06:09.873
I, too, possess some knowledge
of the circumstances facing

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.042
the Kudou family.

00:06:11.577 --> 00:06:12.812
[Harunobu] As a matter of fact,

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:14.616
I suspect I even know
the reason why you're

00:06:14.683 --> 00:06:16.687
so concerned about Tatsuya.

00:06:17.956 --> 00:06:19.759
[car approaching]

00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:25.003
<i>That future is already here.</i>

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.742
<i>Tatsuya's thoroughly proven</i>
<i>to be an invaluable asset</i>

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:29.846
<i>to our national defense force.</i>

00:06:30.213 --> 00:06:31.449
Compared to Ichijou,

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:33.954
he's a superior military asset.

00:06:34.388 --> 00:06:36.325
Maybe it sounds like favoritism.

00:06:36.392 --> 00:06:38.496
Nonetheless,
I truly do believe that.

00:06:38.864 --> 00:06:40.935
<i>In terms of point defense,</i>

00:06:41.002 --> 00:06:43.507

His name is Richard Sun.

Why did you do that?

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.450
It's not like we killed anybody,
okay?

00:12:05.517 --> 00:12:08.890
We didn't go so far as to take
their lives, remember?

00:12:12.097 --> 00:12:15.136
I couldn't care less
how many people you killed

00:12:15.203 --> 00:12:16.840
or how many you've let live.

00:12:16.907 --> 00:12:18.911
Honestly, it's all the same
to me.

00:12:19.913 --> 00:12:22.785
Your gang has incurred my fury.

00:12:23.352 --> 00:12:24.822
That's enough.

00:12:25.189 --> 00:12:28.195
I'm more than convinced
you deserve to die.

00:12:29.431 --> 00:12:30.868
That's demonic.

00:12:31.435 --> 00:12:34.408
[Tatsuya] I was only unable
to unleash this demonic power

00:12:34.474 --> 00:12:35.611
because of you.

00:12:35.678 --> 00:12:38.717
Your henchmen drew out
the very last emotion left

00:12:38.784 --> 00:12:40.821
inside my cold,
frozen heart.

00:12:42.424 --> 00:12:44.061

[Tatsuya] Thanks,

I should be apologizing

for troubling you over
a personal matter.

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:41.108
Forgive me, sir.

00:13:41.175 --> 00:13:43.312
No, it wasn't a personal matter,
Tatsuya.

00:13:43.379 --> 00:13:45.249
I got attacked
by their generator.

00:13:45.316 --> 00:13:47.855
Plus we were able
to obtain crucial combat data

00:13:47.922 --> 00:13:49.525
last night as a result of it.

00:13:49.592 --> 00:13:52.263
It's not often we observe
long range sniping magic

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.802

Why is that news so valuable?

<i>[Shigeru] A human brain.</i>
<i>That's what.</i>

To be specific,
a magician's extracted cerebrum.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.647
We may be an experimental unit
that wields magic offensively

00:14:50.714 --> 00:14:53.085
and yes, our mission
is to integrate magicians into

the military system...

00:14:55.256 --> 00:14:58.329
But we would never use magicians
as literal components.

00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:01.001
That's a foul practice.

00:15:01.536 --> 00:15:04.575
Neither the production

<i>[Harunobu] Even when setting</i>
<i>our emotions aside,</i>

<i>a booster that could expand</i>
<i>a magician's capacity</i>

00:15:12.357 --> 00:15:14.127
<i>would be a military threat</i>
<i>as well.</i>

The USNA agrees
with Japan about that.

What'd they say?

00:15:47.393 --> 00:15:49.231
They wanted to talk about

the Ten Master Clans
reign supreme in this country.

Even when it's simply high
school students playing a game,

00:16:00.521 --> 00:16:02.357
they frankly won't allow
any result

to undermine the prestige

Yes, Tatsuya Shiba.

You're in the Ten Master Clans,
right?

[gasps]

00:21:05.229 --> 00:21:06.398
I'm not.

00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:08.469
My family is nothing special.

00:21:10.072 --> 00:21:11.274
Oh, really?

00:21:11.709 --> 00:21:13.178
Then per the meeting
of the clans,

00:21:13.245 --> 00:21:16.384
I advise you as the magician
who's serving as assistant head

00:21:16.451 --> 00:21:18.288
of the Juumonji family...

00:21:19.023 --> 00:21:20.259
[Katsuto] Shiba,

00:21:20.326 --> 00:21:22.698
you ought to join
the Ten Master Clans.

00:21:25.402 --> 00:21:26.973

Chairman,
what are you implying right now?

00:21:32.851 --> 00:21:35.624
Are you suggesting that I
should take her as my bride?

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:36.726
[Katsuto] Yes.

00:21:37.928 --> 00:21:40.132
Unlike you
and Chairwoman Saegusa,

00:21:40.199 --> 00:21:42.436
I'm still only in high school.

00:21:42.871 --> 00:21:46.111
Any real discussion of marriage
is still very far away.

00:21:46.579 --> 00:21:48.148
[Katsuto] I see.
Yet,

00:21:48.215 --> 00:21:49.952
you bested the Ichijou heir.

00:21:51.388 --> 00:21:53.158
He's destined to become
the next leader

00:21:54.628 --> 00:21:56.231

00:21:56.298 --> 00:21:57.400
