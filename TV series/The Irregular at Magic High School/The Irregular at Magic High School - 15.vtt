[Leonhard] Whatever.

00:00:23.814 --> 00:00:25.083

[both gasping]

00:00:26.587 --> 00:00:29.091
[Tatsuya] Then let's hold
a strategy meeting tomorrow.

00:00:29.158 --> 00:00:31.329
We can start with
the broad strokes for now.

00:00:31.396 --> 00:00:33.734
Leo, I'd like for you
to play on defense.

00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:34.937
[Leonhard] No problem,

00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:38.176
but what exactly does
a defender do?

00:00:38.243 --> 00:00:40.615
Your job will be to protect
your own monolith

00:00:40.682 --> 00:00:42.017
from the enemy attacks.

00:00:42.084 --> 00:00:45.390
You know what you have to do
to win Monolith Code, don't you?

00:00:45.758 --> 00:00:46.694
If I remember correctly,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.496
you can either just knock out
your foes

00:00:48.564 --> 00:00:50.902
or you need to enter
the code that's hidden within

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.772
the enemy's monolith
into a terminal.

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:54.141
Right,

00:00:54.208 --> 00:00:56.947
and in order for a player
to read that secret code,

00:00:57.014 --> 00:00:58.751
they must fire
a special magic sequence

00:00:58.818 --> 00:01:01.557
with a maximum range of 30 feet
at the monolith.

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:03.460
I understand.

00:01:03.527 --> 00:01:05.364
That means the defense's job
would be

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.268
to prevent opponents
from getting anywhere

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:09.472
within 30 feet
of their team's monolith,

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:12.311
and to jam up competitors
so they can't read the code,

00:01:12.378 --> 00:01:14.248
even if they fire
that special sequence

00:01:14.315 --> 00:01:15.785
at the monolith, right?

00:01:15.852 --> 00:01:16.820
Exactly.

00:01:16.887 --> 00:01:18.123
[Leonhard] Hold on.

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:19.726
How are we supposed
to hold off the enemy?

00:01:19.793 --> 00:01:22.064
We can't use
any physical attacks, right?

00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:23.701
Honestly, though,

00:01:23.768 --> 00:01:25.370
I'm so bad
at remote attacks spells,

00:01:25.437 --> 00:01:26.907
it's not even funny.

00:01:26.974 --> 00:01:29.846
Which is why I think you should
be wielding this.

00:01:29.913 --> 00:01:30.848
[Leonhard grunts]

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:34.322
[Tatsuya] All direct
attacks without

00:01:34.388 --> 00:01:36.059
the use of magic are off limits,

00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:38.531
but using a spell
to hurl something toward

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:40.835
the enemy wouldn't count
as a violation.

00:01:40.902 --> 00:01:42.104
Ah.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.177
[grunts]
Smart thinkin'.

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.784
And as for what I'd like you
to handle, Mikihiko,

00:01:48.851 --> 00:01:50.287
you're guerrilla tactics

00:01:50.354 --> 00:01:51.824
[Mikihiko] What's that?

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.493
It's offense and defense.

00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:55.197
Your job
is to back up both aspects

00:01:55.263 --> 00:01:56.567
of our game.

00:01:56.634 --> 00:01:57.569
[grunts]

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:59.171
Tatsuya.

00:01:59.238 --> 00:02:00.440
What's wrong?

00:02:00.508 --> 00:02:02.712
[Mikihiko] You said it yourself,
didn't you?

00:02:03.346 --> 00:02:06.152
That my‐‐you told me
the Yoshida family's

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:07.989
magic sequences
are too convoluted

00:02:08.056 --> 00:02:10.561
and that's why I can't employ
my magic the way I want to.

00:02:11.062 --> 00:02:12.231
It's true.

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:15.772
Admittedly, my spell that day
was camouflaged in order

00:02:15.838 --> 00:02:17.107
to obscure the true nature

00:02:17.174 --> 00:02:19.312
of the magic sequence
I'd activated.

00:02:19.378 --> 00:02:21.550
Unfortunately, I think
that's most likely

00:02:21.617 --> 00:02:24.021
what led to those redundancies
you pointed out.

00:02:24.656 --> 00:02:27.194
Back when lengthy incantations
were necessary,

00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:29.165
that tactic was quite effective.

00:02:29.231 --> 00:02:32.171
Now, not so much
for modern magic

00:02:32.237 --> 00:02:34.776
which has been
greatly accelerated by CADs.

00:02:34.843 --> 00:02:36.079
[laughs]

00:02:36.145 --> 00:02:37.314
Yeah, I get it.

00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:39.118
Despite the fact
that ancient magic

00:02:39.185 --> 00:02:40.420
is more potent in power,

00:02:40.487 --> 00:02:42.992
it stands no chance
against modern magic.

00:02:43.393 --> 00:02:44.930
[Tatsuya] That's where
you're wrong, Mikihiko.

00:02:44.996 --> 00:02:46.132
Uh?

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:48.604
Modern magic if going head
to head

00:02:48.671 --> 00:02:50.742
has the edge due
to its superior speed

00:02:50.808 --> 00:02:53.547
of activation.
That's the only advantage.

00:02:54.048 --> 00:02:55.618
In terms of surprise attacks,

00:02:55.685 --> 00:02:57.321
ancient magic which
is stealthier

00:02:57.388 --> 00:02:59.559
and more powerful would have
the upper hand.

00:02:59.626 --> 00:03:00.762
[gasps]

00:03:00.828 --> 00:03:03.199
[Tatsuya] The elder Mr. Kudo
said so himself.

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:05.037
How you use it is key.

00:03:05.738 --> 00:03:08.476
I want you on the team
because your capability

00:03:08.544 --> 00:03:10.982
to ambush with ancient magic
would I think be

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.519
a powerful weapon for us.

00:03:12.585 --> 00:03:13.386

00:03:21.135 --> 00:03:22.939

[Shinkurou] If you ask me,

00:08:48.156 --> 00:08:50.193
we should be more wary
of his skills in combat

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:51.530
rather than magic.

00:08:51.997 --> 00:08:54.201
And how do you rate
those magic skills?

00:08:55.938 --> 00:08:58.176

the spell dismantling.

00:08:58.644 --> 00:09:00.548

for that final resonance,

an impeccable ambush

00:09:03.854 --> 00:09:06.192
it wasn't enough to knock out
his opponent.

[Masaki] Hmm.

00:09:08.129 --> 00:09:09.632
[Shinkurou]
The logical conclusion

00:09:09.699 --> 00:09:12.070
is he's unable
to wield magic that powerful.

00:09:12.137 --> 00:09:14.007
I don't think you'll need
to worry,

00:09:14.074 --> 00:09:16.212

00:09:16.278 --> 00:09:18.015
but what you'll really need
to watch out for

00:09:18.082 --> 00:09:20.487
is stumbling right into one
of his ambushes.

00:09:20.855 --> 00:09:22.892
Meaning that there's no reason
for Third High to fear

00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:25.163
of frontal assault.
Wouldn't you agree?

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.298

how do we force him into
a head‐on confrontation?

The event he competed in
was Speed Shooting.

00:17:23.954 --> 00:17:27.895
Therefore his specialty spell
must be the Invisible Bullet.
