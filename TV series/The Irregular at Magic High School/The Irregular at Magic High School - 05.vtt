00:00:02.772 --> 00:00:04.275
<i>[singing voice] Aniplex.</i>

00:00:10.287 --> 00:00:13.393
[indistinct chatter]

00:00:15.965 --> 00:00:17.268
[exhales sharply]

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.213
[beeping]

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.691
[Mizuki] 940 milliseconds.
You've cleared it, Tatsuya!

00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:30.728
‐ Yes, finally.
‐ [chuckles nervously]

00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:32.799
Took until my third try
to clear it.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.536
I wouldn't have expected that.

00:00:34.603 --> 00:00:36.306
[Mizuki] So you really
do struggle

00:00:36.372 --> 00:00:37.842
with your practical skills,
don't you?

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:39.880
[grunts]
Seriously?

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.151
I haven't my incompetence
clear yet?

00:00:42.218 --> 00:00:44.990
Mm, well yes,
I did hear you say that.

00:00:45.057 --> 00:00:46.326
I thought it was modesty.

00:00:46.827 --> 00:00:47.762
[chuckles]

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:49.198
Maybe I shouldn't say this.

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:50.702
‐ [gasps]
‐ If I were average

00:00:50.768 --> 00:00:51.704
in practical skills,

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.708
I probably wouldn't be
in this class.

00:00:54.075 --> 00:00:55.745
Yes, you're right.

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:58.517
Although if you were good
at practical skills, too,

00:00:58.584 --> 00:01:01.657
you'd be way too perfect
and not very approachable,

00:01:01.724 --> 00:01:02.659
I think.

00:01:04.061 --> 00:01:05.163
Hey, Tatsuya?

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.399
[Tatsuya] Hmm?

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.270
[Mizuki] Do you feel bitter
about it?

00:01:08.905 --> 00:01:10.073
About what?

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.344
Even though you really do
have talent,

00:01:12.411 --> 00:01:15.083
you've been evaluated as if
you don't have any at all.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.321
[Mizuki] Normally that'd
make someone bitter.

00:01:17.388 --> 00:01:18.991
You seem fine, though.

00:01:19.058 --> 00:01:20.828
It doesn't appear
to be bothering you much.

00:01:20.895 --> 00:01:24.235
Well, processing speed
is a crucial factor, too.

00:01:24.703 --> 00:01:26.172
[Tatsuya] You're not that
far off labeling me

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:27.542
as unskilled.

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:29.880
[Mizuki] And yet if you
actually implemented it,

00:01:29.947 --> 00:01:32.552
the truth of the matter is you
could activate it much faster,

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.121
couldn't you?
‐ [grunts]

00:01:34.723 --> 00:01:35.992
[Tatsuya] Why do you
think that?

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:37.729
During your first try,

00:01:37.796 --> 00:01:40.233
at one point you canceled
your magic sequence

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.971
and rebuilt it from scratch.
Am I right?

00:01:42.404 --> 00:01:43.874
[Mizuki] And in terms
of the timing,

00:01:43.941 --> 00:01:45.578
you read the activation sequence

00:01:45.645 --> 00:01:48.551
and built your first
magic sequence simultaneously.

00:01:48.618 --> 00:01:51.189
Seeing that got me wondering
that for casting

00:01:51.255 --> 00:01:52.926
a low‐level spell like this,

00:01:52.993 --> 00:01:54.863
you could build
the magic sequence directly

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.234
without using any activation
sequences at all.

00:01:58.436 --> 00:02:00.107
I never realized you
were capable

00:02:00.173 --> 00:02:01.510
of seeing that much.

00:02:02.077 --> 00:02:03.781
You really do have good eyes.

00:02:03.848 --> 00:02:05.017
[gasps]

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:07.689
Sure,
for basic single systems spells,

00:02:07.756 --> 00:02:09.826
I guess I could invoke
more quickly

00:02:09.893 --> 00:02:11.664
if I built my sequence directly.

00:02:12.097 --> 00:02:14.302
However, not every single time.

00:02:14.368 --> 00:02:15.838
Not if it has too many steps.

00:02:16.573 --> 00:02:17.642
Think.

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.378
<i>When you use magic</i>
<i>to move an egg</i>

00:02:19.445 --> 00:02:21.115
<i>from the kitchen to a table,</i>

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:23.219
<i>it's a four‐process spell.</i>

00:02:24.523 --> 00:02:27.194
<i>Remove movement and suspension</i>
<i>from that spell,</i>

00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:30.902
<i>activation speeds up,</i>
<i>but the egg shell will break.</i>

00:02:32.772 --> 00:02:34.843
<i>However, to knock</i>
<i>your opponent backwards</i>

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.179
<i>in battle,</i>

00:02:36.245 --> 00:02:38.083
<i>there's no need</i>
<i>to absorb the impact.</i>

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:39.720
<i>It takes one process.</i>

00:02:40.855 --> 00:02:43.961
Since I hit my maximum
at five processes,

00:02:44.028 --> 00:02:45.163
it's all I can do.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.900
Well, I imagine
that five processes

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:49.271
would be more than enough
for combat use.

00:02:49.338 --> 00:02:51.175
[chuckles]
But I'm not studying magic

00:02:51.242 --> 00:02:52.746
for combat use.

00:02:52.812 --> 00:02:56.052
My career goal is to use magic
in order to develop energy.

00:02:56.285 --> 00:02:57.454
To do that,

00:02:57.522 --> 00:02:59.425
I need multiple
process spells invoked

00:02:59.492 --> 00:03:01.229
by activation sequences.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.503
That's why I can deal
with being evaluated fairly.

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.472
There's simply no way
of getting around it.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.677
It's due to my inferior
processing skills.

00:03:08.744 --> 00:03:09.846
Hmm?

00:03:09.913 --> 00:03:12.919
That's incredible, Tatsuya!
I'm so impressed!

00:03:12.986 --> 00:03:14.188
Huh?

00:03:14.255 --> 00:03:16.693
You can use magic
so you become a magician.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.231
At least that's the normal way
of doing things around here,

00:03:19.298 --> 00:03:20.635
but your reason
for studying magic

00:03:20.702 --> 00:03:22.839
is because you have
your own personal goals.

00:03:22.906 --> 00:03:25.912
Wait, now that I think about it,
that is true.

00:03:25.978 --> 00:03:29.251
‐ So, time for a fresh start.
‐ Uh, huh?

00:03:29.318 --> 00:03:32.257
At first I was only here
so I could study magic

00:03:32.324 --> 00:03:34.361
for the purpose
of controlling these eyes.

00:03:34.428 --> 00:03:35.998
It wasn't about wanting
to do anything.

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:37.535
Not rally, at least.

00:03:37.602 --> 00:03:40.340
I think magic should be more
than just a means to an end.

00:03:40.842 --> 00:03:42.979
But from now on
I'll give it serious thought.

00:03:43.046 --> 00:03:44.448
Hey, hey, Mizuki.

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:45.685
Yes, it's obvious,

00:03:45.752 --> 00:03:47.154
as long as we both
have conviction

00:03:47.221 --> 00:03:48.490
and a goal in mind.

00:03:48.557 --> 00:03:49.960
A little bit of slander
can't break our spirits,

00:03:50.026 --> 00:03:51.395
can it?

00:03:51.462 --> 00:03:53.266
And if the two of us can achieve
our cherished goals,

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:56.072
our grades at this high school
are of secondary importance.

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.243
That's what you
and I both live for, isn't it?

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:01.115
Each individual should seek out
what they alone want to live for

00:04:01.182 --> 00:04:02.351
and then‐‐

00:04:02.418 --> 00:04:04.589

[Sayaka] You asked me a question
the other day.

00:06:03.026 --> 00:06:05.831
Originally, I suppose I thought
that letting the school know

00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:08.203
we weren't all about magic
would be enough.

00:06:09.171 --> 00:06:11.944
Now, though, I realize that
it's not nearly enough.

00:06:13.747 --> 00:06:15.651
What we want is simple.

00:06:15.718 --> 00:06:17.421
We're going to demand
that Magic High School

00:06:17.487 --> 00:06:18.924
improves our conditions.

00:06:21.395 --> 00:06:22.865
More specifically,
though,

00:06:22.932 --> 00:06:24.536
what is it that you want them
to improve?

00:06:24.603 --> 00:06:25.838
Well, everything!

00:06:25.905 --> 00:06:27.775
All aspects
of the way we're treated here.

00:06:27.842 --> 00:06:29.613
The main difference
that I have seen

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:31.817
between course one
and course two students

00:06:31.883 --> 00:06:33.787
is the availability
or lack thereof

00:06:33.854 --> 00:06:35.758
of the curriculum's instructors.

00:06:35.825 --> 00:06:38.931
Would I be correct in assuming
that you want Magic High School

00:06:38.998 --> 00:06:40.735
to employ additional
faculty members?

00:06:40.801 --> 00:06:41.837
[gasps]

00:06:41.904 --> 00:06:44.308
I don't mean to take things
that far, but...

00:06:44.375 --> 00:06:46.613
So it's about club activities.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.086
It's my understanding that
the kendo and the kenjutsu teams

00:06:50.153 --> 00:06:52.725
are allotted the same amount
of practicing space.

00:06:53.727 --> 00:06:55.330
[groans]
That might be true,

00:06:55.397 --> 00:06:57.000
but that isn't really the point.

00:06:57.067 --> 00:06:59.438
Wait, are you saying
that you're not disgruntled?

00:06:59.506 --> 00:07:01.375
Disgruntled?
Of course.

00:07:01.442 --> 00:07:03.179
Uh, so then‐‐

00:07:03.246 --> 00:07:04.415
[Tatsuya] However...

00:07:04.983 --> 00:07:07.655
There's nothing in particular
that I think is necessary

00:07:07.722 --> 00:07:08.891
for the high school to alter.

00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.193
Huh?

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.099
[Tatsuya] My expectations
with this educational facility

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:14.435
only go so far.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.339
If I can gain access

00:07:16.405 --> 00:07:18.443
to unpublished
documents exclusive

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.382
to Magic University
and receive my diploma

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:22.986
from this affiliated
high school,

00:07:23.052 --> 00:07:24.522
then there
is nothing more than that

00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:26.092
which I shall be needing
from it.

00:07:27.127 --> 00:07:28.296
Besides...

00:07:28.731 --> 00:07:31.002
I'm not about to blame
the school's administration

00:07:31.068 --> 00:07:33.039
for students using slurs,

00:07:33.106 --> 00:07:35.043
which have been
expressly forbidden.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.513
[groans]

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.418

that you and I don't share

00:07:39.485 --> 00:07:41.155
the same principles,
Miss Mibu.

Okay, what's the situation?

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.851
Our people have cut off
their power

00:08:28.917 --> 00:08:31.022
so they can't do
any more broadcasts.

00:08:31.088 --> 00:08:33.560
<i>[Mari] However, the coalition</i>
<i>has locked the door</i>

<i>they stole</i>
<i>the master key beforehand.</i>

00:08:41.943 --> 00:08:43.947
But that's clearly
criminal conduct.

00:08:44.014 --> 00:08:46.787
[Suzune] It is indeed,
and with that considered,

00:08:46.853 --> 00:08:48.824
this needs
to be handled delicately

00:08:48.891 --> 00:08:50.995

from blowing up any further.

That won't necessarily
deescalate anything.

00:08:54.903 --> 00:08:56.640
They won't suddenly
become docile

00:08:56.707 --> 00:08:58.443
just because we decide
to be discreet.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.013
Even if we use force,

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.983
we should try to resolve
this quickly.

00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:05.290
And you,
Chairman Jumonji?

00:09:05.356 --> 00:09:06.793
[Tatsuya] What are your thoughts
on the matter?

00:09:07.562 --> 00:09:08.731
My thoughts?

00:09:08.797 --> 00:09:10.333
I don't think there's
any real downside

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.304
to negotiating with them.

00:09:12.772 --> 00:09:14.743
[Katsuto] This was always just
a pretext.

00:09:14.809 --> 00:09:16.813
If we can refute that
strongly enough,

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.485
it should assuage
their anxieties.

00:09:19.552 --> 00:09:21.088
If I'm understanding correctly,

00:09:21.155 --> 00:09:23.326
you're recommending
we just do nothing?

00:09:23.392 --> 00:09:24.696
As far as that goes,

00:09:24.763 --> 00:09:26.432
I haven't decided just yet.

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:28.302
We can't allow their
unlawful behavior

00:09:28.369 --> 00:09:29.539
to go unpunished.

00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:31.810
[Katsuto] However,
I don't find it criminal enough

00:09:31.877 --> 00:09:33.814
to warrant destroying
school facilities

00:09:33.881 --> 00:09:35.885

of a speedy resolution.

We will listen to your demands.

00:11:37.127 --> 00:11:40.266
in this instance and approving
of the extreme measures you took

00:11:40.333 --> 00:11:41.335

[grunts]

[Mayumi] You're absolutely right

00:11:44.842 --> 00:11:46.245
[Katsuto] Miss Saegusa?

00:11:46.312 --> 00:11:48.750
Disciplinary committee,
would you kindly release them?

00:11:49.418 --> 00:11:50.721
Hold on.

[Mayumi] I know, Mari.
I know.

00:11:52.324 --> 00:11:55.330
However, we can't set up
the negotiations

00:11:55.396 --> 00:11:56.900
with Miss Mibu alone.

00:11:56.967 --> 00:11:58.904
As long as they're students
at this high school,

00:11:58.971 --> 00:12:00.708
we needn't view them
as flight risks.

00:12:00.774 --> 00:12:02.410
[gasps]
No, we would never run away!

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.918
The school has decided
to leave this matter

of the student council.

00:12:08.256 --> 00:12:09.324

00:12:09.391 --> 00:12:12.832

00:12:39.519 --> 00:12:40.955
Could we speak with you, please?

00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:43.426
[Mayumi] Oh, Tatsuya.
And Miyuki.

00:12:43.492 --> 00:12:44.494
What's the matter?

00:12:44.562 --> 00:12:46.298
About yesterday's incident.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.277
[Mayumi] They want
equal treatment between

00:12:52.344 --> 00:12:54.481
the course one
and the course two students.

00:12:55.283 --> 00:12:57.888
However, they don't seem
to have figured out exactly

00:12:57.955 --> 00:12:59.525
how they want
to change things.

00:12:59.592 --> 00:13:02.130
If anything, I sense they wanted
the student council

00:13:02.197 --> 00:13:03.533
to come up with the next steps.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.806
Then it devolved into
an emotional back and forth.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.614
We decided to hold a forum
which will take place tomorrow

00:13:10.681 --> 00:13:11.816
when school gets out.

00:13:11.883 --> 00:13:14.454
That compromise happened
pretty quickly.

00:13:15.223 --> 00:13:17.460
And while I do understand
the strategy

00:13:17.528 --> 00:13:20.466
of not giving your opponent time
to prepare,

00:13:20.534 --> 00:13:21.503
by the same token,

00:13:21.569 --> 00:13:23.807
we'll have just
as little time ourselves.

00:13:23.874 --> 00:13:25.778
Which members
of the student council

00:13:25.844 --> 00:13:27.414
are participating in this forum?

00:13:31.556 --> 00:13:33.459
Don't tell me you're going
to be the only one.

00:13:33.527 --> 00:13:34.796
[gasps]

00:13:35.196 --> 00:13:36.733
Since we're all running low
on time,

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.402
if I'm the one up there,

00:13:38.469 --> 00:13:41.710
they won't rip me to shreds over
minor differences of opinion.

00:13:42.344 --> 00:13:44.181
I'm more afraid
of impression manipulation

00:13:44.247 --> 00:13:46.251
making this too emotional.

00:13:46.318 --> 00:13:48.022
So that they couldn't get
the best of you

00:13:48.089 --> 00:13:49.491
in a logical dispute.

00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:50.928
[grunts]

00:13:51.495 --> 00:13:52.531
And besides...

00:13:57.107 --> 00:13:58.710
[Mayumi] If for some reason
those students

00:13:58.777 --> 00:14:00.714
have solid enough reasons
to defeat me

00:14:00.781 --> 00:14:02.217

level‐headed debate...

would have to do

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.899
is integrate that into how
we run this school.

We just met,

an extracurricular organization

00:15:24.481 --> 00:15:27.220

[Yakumo] Kinoe Tsukasa,
formerly known as Kinoe Kamono.

00:15:43.119 --> 00:15:45.189
None of his parents

00:15:47.862 --> 00:15:50.032
They're a so‐called
ordinary family.

00:15:50.099 --> 00:15:52.470
It's actually part
of the onmyoji,

00:15:52.538 --> 00:15:54.942
an often‐overlooked branch
of the Kamo clan.

00:15:55.009 --> 00:15:58.783
Kinoe's eyes must be some sort
of throwback to his ancestors.

00:15:59.619 --> 00:16:01.589
Master, did you already know
that I wanted you

00:16:01.656 --> 00:16:03.593
to look
into Kinoe Tsukasa's past?

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:04.662
No.

00:16:04.729 --> 00:16:06.231
It had nothing to do
with your request.

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:08.068
I simply knew about him already.

00:16:08.537 --> 00:16:11.208
It may be true that I'm a priest
but even more than that,

00:16:11.275 --> 00:16:13.445
I consider myself a shinobi.

00:16:14.047 --> 00:16:16.118
Any individual with a background
that might prove

00:16:16.185 --> 00:16:18.489
to be problematic
for society someday,

00:16:18.557 --> 00:16:21.395
I make a point
of investigating each one.

00:16:22.096 --> 00:16:23.967
[Tatsuya] Have you
investigated us, too?

00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:27.040
It's certainly not
for lack of trying,

[Yakumo] The intelligence
manipulation concerning you two

00:16:32.016 --> 00:16:33.352
is ironclad.

00:16:33.419 --> 00:16:36.391
I really must tip my hat
to the both of you for that.

00:16:37.293 --> 00:16:39.030
Excuse me, Master.

the lion's share

by the course two students.

Isn't that proof
that preferential treatment

00:18:11.448 --> 00:18:13.753
