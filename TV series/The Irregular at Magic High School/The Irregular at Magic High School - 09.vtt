[Tatsurou] Not that your hatred

00:08:30.688 --> 00:08:32.324
of her
isn't totally unwarranted,

00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:33.393
of course.

00:08:33.459 --> 00:08:34.863
[exhales]

00:08:38.604 --> 00:08:39.906
[Tatsurou] Tatsuya.

00:08:41.543 --> 00:08:42.612
[Tatsuya] No, Dad.

00:08:42.678 --> 00:08:44.214
You've got it all wrong.

00:08:45.751 --> 00:08:48.222
I don't harbor any hatred
for Mom at all.

00:08:48.289 --> 00:08:50.026
Is‐‐is that right?

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:53.867
<i>[Tatsuya] I don't have</i>
<i>a heart capable of hate.</i>

00:08:55.403 --> 00:08:57.040
<i>All that I Have left now is...</i>

00:08:59.244 --> 00:09:01.516
[Boy] Good morning!
We heard the news, man!

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:02.785
That's so awesome for you!

00:09:02.852 --> 00:09:04.589
Best of luck to you, Shiba!

00:09:04.656 --> 00:09:06.192
You're an engineer?
You'll be great.

00:09:08.997 --> 00:09:11.102
Word really does travel fast,
huh?

00:09:11.536 --> 00:09:12.404
[Mizuki] You're right
about that.

00:09:12.471 --> 00:09:13.707
After all,

00:09:13.774 --> 00:09:15.243
the council only just made
the decision.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:16.345
[Erika] Speaking of which,

00:09:16.412 --> 00:09:17.849
aren't they making
the official announcement

00:09:17.915 --> 00:09:19.184
during today's launch ceremony?

00:09:19.251 --> 00:09:21.790
That's during fifth period,
right?

00:09:21.857 --> 00:09:23.694
Tatsuya, are you taking part
in that?

00:09:24.161 --> 00:09:25.163
Yeah.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.033
There are no other
course two students?

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.506
Word on the street
is those course one blowhards

00:09:29.572 --> 00:09:31.208
are totally pissed off about it.

00:09:31.643 --> 00:09:34.649
[Tatsuya] Yeah, but the athletes
are all course one students.

00:09:34.716 --> 00:09:36.787
Well, there's simply no way
of helping it.

00:09:36.853 --> 00:09:38.891
Jealousy isn't based on reason,
after all.

00:09:38.957 --> 00:09:41.696
Oh, you'll be fine.
Unlike recruitment week,

00:09:41.763 --> 00:09:43.266
they won't be hurling magic
at you.

00:09:43.332 --> 00:09:45.403
<i>[dramatic piano music]</i>

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.276
<i>[applause]</i>

00:09:55.791 --> 00:09:57.662
[Mayumi] Next up,
from class 1A,

00:09:57.728 --> 00:09:59.231
Miss Honoka Mitsui.

00:10:07.013 --> 00:10:10.588
[applause]

00:10:10.654 --> 00:10:12.324
It's pretty nerve‐wracking, huh?

00:10:13.727 --> 00:10:15.330
It really is.

00:10:15.396 --> 00:10:16.766
[chuckles]

00:10:19.304 --> 00:10:20.841

00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:30.728
And from class 1E,
welcome Tatsuya Shiba.

00:10:39.478 --> 00:10:40.714
[gasps]

00:10:51.268 --> 00:10:53.272
And now if you would please
join me

00:10:53.339 --> 00:10:56.746
in giving First High's finest
a nice round of applause.

00:10:58.049 --> 00:10:59.786
<i>[Tatsuya] I'm Shiba,</i>
<i>your engineer.</i>

00:10:59.853 --> 00:11:02.057
Aside from fine tuning CADs,

00:11:02.123 --> 00:11:04.328
I'll be involved in creating
training regimens

00:11:04.394 --> 00:11:06.198
and providing strategic support.

00:11:06.867 --> 00:11:09.739
I would much rather have
a girl for my engineer.

00:11:09.806 --> 00:11:11.475
It's all the same to me,
personally.

00:11:11.543 --> 00:11:14.181
Just as long as they do
their job right, that is.

00:11:14.248 --> 00:11:17.187
Oh, Eimi, knock it off!
And you as well, Subaru!

00:11:17.254 --> 00:11:19.024
Tatsuya
has professional‐grade skills.

00:11:19.091 --> 00:11:20.661
‐ You hear me?
‐ Honoka,

00:11:20.728 --> 00:11:22.698
you used his first name
just now.

00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:24.636
Is he your boyfriend
or something?

00:11:24.702 --> 00:11:26.071
[gasps]
No, of course.

00:11:26.138 --> 00:11:28.644
It's not like that!
Come on, Shizuku.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:29.879
[Honoka] Right?
Tell them.

00:11:29.946 --> 00:11:32.552
Yeah, I also call him
by his first name.

00:11:32.618 --> 00:11:34.454
Seriously?
You do, too?

00:11:34.522 --> 00:11:37.862
Can you believe your brother
has two girlfriends, Miyuki?

00:11:37.929 --> 00:11:40.133
Both Honoka and Shizuku
are just good friends

00:11:40.199 --> 00:11:41.302
with my brother.

00:11:41.703 --> 00:11:43.206
‐ Just friends?
‐ That's right,

00:11:43.272 --> 00:11:44.308
and nothing more.

00:11:44.374 --> 00:11:45.410
[Eimi] Really?

00:11:45.476 --> 00:11:46.646
[Miyuki] They're his friends.

00:11:46.713 --> 00:11:48.449
[inhales and exhales sharply]

00:11:50.019 --> 00:11:52.324
I'd like to get
this meeting started, everybody.

00:12:05.851 --> 00:12:07.655
[distant whistle blowing]

00:12:07.722 --> 00:12:09.191

00:12:58.456 --> 00:12:59.926
I know this scent.

<i>[Mizuki] Spirits?</i>

00:13:18.062 --> 00:13:20.166
<i>That's Yoshida.</i>

00:13:20.934 --> 00:13:22.037
Who's there?

00:13:25.611 --> 00:13:26.846
[gasps]

00:13:29.852 --> 00:13:31.288

[gasps]

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:39.572
[Mizuki] Tatsuya!

00:13:40.674 --> 00:13:42.077
Calm down, Mikihiko.

00:13:42.143 --> 00:13:43.814
I'm not trying
to start anything with you.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:44.849
Understood?

00:13:44.916 --> 00:13:46.251
[gasps]

00:13:46.318 --> 00:13:47.855
My bad, Tatsuya.

00:13:47.922 --> 00:13:50.426
I never had any intention
of hurting you two.

00:13:50.493 --> 00:13:51.896
Don't worry about it.

00:13:51.963 --> 00:13:54.234
It's Mizuki who should be
the one apologizing

00:13:54.301 --> 00:13:56.639
for disturbing
a spell caster's composure.

00:13:56.706 --> 00:13:58.844
Hold on!
How's this on me?

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:01.315
Oh, no.
This isn't her fault.

00:14:01.683 --> 00:14:03.386
[Mikihiko] It's my inexperience.

00:14:03.954 --> 00:14:06.492
So thanks, Tatsuya.
Because you showed up,

00:14:06.559 --> 00:14:09.699
I avoided mistakenly injuring
Miss Shibata.

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:11.503
Even if I hadn't interfered,

00:14:11.569 --> 00:14:13.472
you wouldn't actually
have hurt her.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.176
Anyway, what were you doing?

00:14:15.243 --> 00:14:16.679
Practicing ancient spells?

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:18.650
Spirit magic, was it?

00:14:18.717 --> 00:14:20.019
[gasps]

00:14:20.554 --> 00:14:21.790
[groans]

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.428
I guess it's too late
to try to hide it now.

00:14:25.096 --> 00:14:26.465
It's just like you said.

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:28.537
I was utilizing water spirits
to practice

00:14:28.603 --> 00:14:30.106
my summoning magic skills.

00:14:30.473 --> 00:14:32.343
So those were water spirits
I saw?

00:14:34.114 --> 00:14:35.718
What did they look like to you,
though?

00:14:35.784 --> 00:14:36.820
Let's see.

00:14:36.886 --> 00:14:37.955
There was blue,
pale blue,

00:14:38.022 --> 00:14:39.525
and also indigo blue.

00:14:39.992 --> 00:14:41.796
Orbs of light
in different shades of blue.

00:14:41.863 --> 00:14:43.232
That's about all
that I could perceive.

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:45.136
You could distinguish
every shade?

00:14:45.203 --> 00:14:47.140
[gasps]
Well...

00:14:47.842 --> 00:14:49.144
[Mizuki] I, uh...

00:14:49.846 --> 00:14:51.516
Oh, um...

00:14:53.553 --> 00:14:55.123
‐ [Tatsuya clears throat]
‐ [both gasping]

00:14:55.557 --> 00:14:57.728
If this is consensual,
then I'm leaving.

00:14:58.262 --> 00:14:59.732
But if not,
we have a problem.

00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:00.934
[both gasping]

00:15:01.001 --> 00:15:02.370
[groans]

00:15:02.437 --> 00:15:03.573
Sorry.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.243
Uh, no, I should...

00:15:05.744 --> 00:15:07.147
Apologize.

00:15:07.213 --> 00:15:09.886
[Tatsuya] I see no reason
for you to say sorry, Mizuki.

00:15:09.952 --> 00:15:11.656
Oh.

00:15:12.691 --> 00:15:14.127
Really, I do apologize.

00:15:14.194 --> 00:15:16.265
When I thought you might possess
the crystal eyes,

00:15:16.331 --> 00:15:18.537
something came over me.
I just couldn't help myself.

00:15:20.106 --> 00:15:21.910
It's water under the bridge,
Yoshida.

00:15:22.444 --> 00:15:23.780
You startled me,
that's all,

00:15:23.847 --> 00:15:25.149
so let's forget about it.

00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:26.786
However,
it did embarrass me,

00:15:26.853 --> 00:15:29.725
so please don't do anything
like that ever again, 'kay?

00:15:29.792 --> 00:15:31.629
I'm so terribly sorry.

00:15:31.696 --> 00:15:34.569
Mikihiko, did I hear
you say "crystal eyes?"

00:15:34.635 --> 00:15:35.671
If you don't mind,

00:15:35.737 --> 00:15:37.508
could you please explain
to me what those are?

00:15:38.977 --> 00:15:40.213
Oh, sure.

00:15:40.279 --> 00:15:42.383
It's not like it's a
big secret anyway.

00:15:43.052 --> 00:15:44.187
Typically,

00:15:44.254 --> 00:15:46.225
magicians who manipulate spirits

00:15:46.291 --> 00:15:48.462
identify each spirit
by its color,

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.801
but it's not like we
can really see them

00:15:50.868 --> 00:15:52.203
in the true sense of the word.

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:53.573
Huh?

00:15:53.974 --> 00:15:57.213
You mean you don't perceive
the colors visually, then?

00:15:57.681 --> 00:15:59.519
Rather, you interpret
their frequencies

00:15:59.585 --> 00:16:00.621
by using magic?

00:16:01.556 --> 00:16:02.725
That's well said.

00:16:03.259 --> 00:16:06.165
How you view the colors varies
by your school of magic.

00:16:06.533 --> 00:16:08.135
[Mikihiko] In the tradition
that I come from,

00:16:08.202 --> 00:16:10.641
we think of water as blue
and fire as red.

00:16:10.707 --> 00:16:13.312
Though, we're taught to make
a conscious effort

00:16:13.379 --> 00:16:15.216
to recognize it this way
in our mind.

00:16:15.283 --> 00:16:17.555
But Mizuki didn't even have
to try.

00:16:18.222 --> 00:16:19.892
[Mikihiko] I"m guessing
that you're perceiving

00:16:19.959 --> 00:16:22.497
the differences in each
individual water spirit's power

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:25.269
and nature as different shades
of color.

00:16:25.336 --> 00:16:27.575
The so‐called eyes
that see God Himself

00:16:27.641 --> 00:16:30.179
are legendary among us
spiritual magicians.

00:16:30.614 --> 00:16:32.383
Or, the crystal eyes.

00:16:33.687 --> 00:16:37.026
Meaning that Mizuki is exactly
the type of person

00:16:37.093 --> 00:16:39.030
you'd do anything
to get your hands on, then.

00:16:39.097 --> 00:16:40.299
You're right.

00:16:40.366 --> 00:16:42.470
Or at least a year ago,
I would have,

00:16:42.538 --> 00:16:43.339
and truth be told,

00:16:43.405 --> 00:16:44.474
I might have claimed her all

00:16:44.542 --> 00:16:46.445
for myself
by any means necessary.

00:16:46.513 --> 00:16:47.313
[gasps]

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.850
Uh, don't get me wrong, though!

00:16:48.917 --> 00:16:52.490
I‐‐I don't have those kinds
of tendencies anymore, okay?

00:16:52.558 --> 00:16:53.627
But nevertheless,

00:16:53.693 --> 00:16:55.664
I'm not inclined to tell
the other spell casters

00:16:55.731 --> 00:16:57.500
that the key
to divine magic skills

00:16:57.568 --> 00:16:58.737
exists within you.

00:16:59.772 --> 00:17:00.841
That's a good idea.

00:17:00.908 --> 00:17:02.043
I've decided that I'm going

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:06.251
to keep this information
to myself as well.

00:17:06.318 --> 00:17:09.224
Uh, what are you talking about?

00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:16.171
[distant cicadas chirping]

00:17:24.555 --> 00:17:25.958
[Mayumi gasping]

00:17:26.024 --> 00:17:27.293
I'm so sorry, everyone!

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.431
You kept us waiting, Mayumi.

00:17:29.497 --> 00:17:31.268
Do you know that you're
an hour and a half late?

00:17:31.335 --> 00:17:32.805
[Mayumi] I'm really sorry.

00:17:32.871 --> 00:17:34.174
[exhales sharply]

00:17:37.948 --> 00:17:39.518
So sorry, Tatsuya.

00:17:39.585 --> 00:17:42.357
I feel bad you had to wait
for so long on account of me.

00:17:42.423 --> 00:17:45.664
It's fine.
I was informed of the situation.

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:48.603
I hear that you had
a family emergency.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:50.908
Yes.
Well, anyway, Tatsuya,

00:17:50.974 --> 00:17:53.178
what do you think of my dress?

00:17:57.253 --> 00:17:59.057
It's truly becoming on you.

00:17:59.525 --> 00:18:01.796
Mean it?
You flatter me.

00:18:01.863 --> 00:18:02.698
Although if you'd been

00:18:02.765 --> 00:18:05.069
a bit more bashful
complimenting me,

00:18:05.136 --> 00:18:07.307
that would have been
sheer perfection.

00:18:08.843 --> 00:18:10.814
I can see that you're
stressed out right now.

00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:12.016
Huh?

00:18:12.618 --> 00:18:14.120
[Tatsuya] Being
in the Ten Master Clans

00:18:14.187 --> 00:18:15.624
and in the Saegusa family,
no less...

00:18:15.691 --> 00:18:16.526
[exhales]

00:18:16.592 --> 00:18:17.728
[Tatsuya] It must weigh on you.

00:18:17.795 --> 00:18:20.399
Now then,
let's get this bus moving.

00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:21.970
You'll be able
to get some good rest

00:18:22.036 --> 00:18:23.205
while we're out on the road.

00:18:26.946 --> 00:18:29.585
Wait, um,
hey, Tatsuya!

00:18:31.321 --> 00:18:33.359
You've misread the situation,
you know.

00:18:34.294 --> 00:18:37.433
[engine revving]

00:18:39.905 --> 00:18:43.278
Honestly, he is so unbelievable.
The nerve!

00:18:43.345 --> 00:18:45.216
Just what kind
of person does he think I am?

00:18:45.717 --> 00:18:48.623
To think I was even going
to ask him to sit next to me.

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:50.493
[Suzune] He did the right thing.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.361
Uh...

00:18:51.428 --> 00:18:53.298
In my personal opinion,

00:18:53.365 --> 00:18:55.269
he made a good decision
to avoid falling prey

00:18:55.336 --> 00:18:56.338
to you,
Miss Saegusa.

00:18:56.405 --> 00:18:58.409
Hey, that's harsh!

00:18:58.475 --> 00:19:01.114
Of course, Shiba is known
to have the rare ability

00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:03.185
to nullify his opponents' magic.

00:19:03.252 --> 00:19:06.024
It might be possible
your bewitching face

00:19:06.091 --> 00:19:07.393
has no effect on the guy.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.130
Oh, say what you want.

00:19:11.034 --> 00:19:12.270
[Gyobu] Pardon.

00:19:12.337 --> 00:19:14.341
So you're not feeling well,
then, chairwoman?

00:19:14.407 --> 00:19:16.111
[Mizuki] Oh, hi, Hanzo.

00:19:16.546 --> 00:19:18.783
Um, actually, it's not
like I'm sick or anything.

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:21.021
[Gyobu] You not wanting the rest
of the team to worry,

00:19:21.088 --> 00:19:22.357
that thoughtfulness of yours,

00:19:22.423 --> 00:19:24.628
I know it's
an admirable quality,

00:19:24.695 --> 00:19:27.801
but please don't push yourself
to the breaking point

00:19:27.868 --> 00:19:30.139
on our account‐‐uh...

00:19:30.206 --> 00:19:31.642
[shudders]

00:19:31.709 --> 00:19:33.212
[Suzune] Vice chairman Hattori!

00:19:33.278 --> 00:19:35.282
What exactly are you staring at?

00:19:35.349 --> 00:19:37.153
What do you mean?
I'm not looking at anything!

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.257
Well, I just thought
the chairwoman

00:19:39.324 --> 00:19:40.861
might want a blanket
if she's sick!

00:19:41.495 --> 00:19:43.032
‐ [gasps]
‐ Please be my guest.

00:19:43.098 --> 00:19:44.267

‐ [Gyobu stammering]
‐ [exhales]

00:19:46.572 --> 00:19:48.843
What are those guys doing,
messing around like that?

00:19:50.212 --> 00:19:51.448
‐ [Kanon exhales]
‐ [grunts]

00:19:51.516 --> 00:19:53.887
‐ [Mari] Kanon.
‐ Yes?

00:19:53.953 --> 00:19:55.857
It shouldn't take more
than two hours

00:19:55.924 --> 00:19:57.226
to reach our hotel.

00:19:57.293 --> 00:19:58.963
So, you can't even
wait that long?

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:00.934
Wow, that's mean of you to say.

00:20:01.001 --> 00:20:02.905
Of course I can wait that long.

00:20:03.238 --> 00:20:04.675
It's just that,
no offense to you,

00:20:04.742 --> 00:20:06.445
but I was looking forward
to sitting next to Kei

00:20:06.512 --> 00:20:08.015
on our bus trip today.

00:20:08.082 --> 00:20:09.384
‐ Yeah, sure.
‐ And besides,

00:20:09.451 --> 00:20:11.254
is it not perfectly natural
to wanna spend time

00:20:11.321 --> 00:20:12.290
with your fiance?

00:20:12.356 --> 00:20:13.492
<i>[Kanon] First of all,</i>

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.795
<i>why should</i>
<i>the technical staff have</i>

00:20:14.862 --> 00:20:15.864
<i>to take another bus?</i>

00:20:15.931 --> 00:20:17.835
<i>Besides,</i>
<i>it's nowhere even near full.</i>

00:20:17.901 --> 00:20:19.939
<i>There was no reason whatsoever</i>
<i>to split us up.</i>

00:20:20.005 --> 00:20:21.408
<i>[Mari] Kanon, come on.</i>
<i>Knock it off.</i>

00:20:21.475 --> 00:20:23.747
[Kanon] But‐‐but it's not fair!

[exhales]

00:20:25.082 --> 00:20:27.153
[Honoka] Hey, um, Miyuki?

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.757
Would you like some tea?

00:20:29.124 --> 00:20:30.627
No, thank you, Honoka.

00:20:30.994 --> 00:20:32.430
You're kind to offer.

00:20:32.497 --> 00:20:34.300
It's just I'm not really
that thirsty.

00:20:34.367 --> 00:20:35.369
After all,

00:20:35.436 --> 00:20:36.939
I wasn't forced to stand outside

00:20:37.006 --> 00:20:39.177
in this extreme heat
for almost two hours

00:20:39.244 --> 00:20:40.781
like my poor brother was.

00:20:40.847 --> 00:20:43.485
Oh, um, you're right.

00:20:45.156 --> 00:20:46.324
‐ Hmm?
‐ What were you thinking,

00:20:46.391 --> 00:20:48.162
reminding her about
her brother like that?

00:20:48.228 --> 00:20:49.965
This time it was beyond
my control!

00:20:51.134 --> 00:20:52.504
I'm sure that there was no need

00:20:52.571 --> 00:20:54.407
to make him wait outside
the bus.

00:20:55.142 --> 00:20:57.881
Why did my brother have
to needlessly suffer?

00:21:00.286 --> 00:21:01.656
Hey, but Miyuki...

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:04.829
This is exactly why your brother
is such a great guy.

00:21:04.895 --> 00:21:07.266
Nobody'd complain
if they had to wait inside

00:21:07.333 --> 00:21:08.870
the air conditioned,

00:21:08.937 --> 00:21:11.174
but seeing a job to the end
without slacking off

00:21:11.241 --> 00:21:13.112
in the least even
for something tedious

00:21:13.178 --> 00:21:14.882
like taking attendance,

00:21:14.949 --> 00:21:16.284
not many can do that.

00:21:16.351 --> 00:21:17.521
Yeah.

00:21:17.588 --> 00:21:19.525
Know what I think, Miyuki?

00:21:19.592 --> 00:21:21.529
Your brother is totally awesome.

00:21:21.596 --> 00:21:22.698
[grunts]

00:21:23.499 --> 00:21:24.702
You're right.

00:21:24.768 --> 00:21:27.273
Sometimes my brother can be kind
to a fault

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.177
in the strangest of ways.

00:21:29.244 --> 00:21:31.749
