[both] Thank you very much,

That's very true
but at the same time

00:03:02.364 --> 00:03:03.968
your own achievements
shouldn't be denied.

00:03:04.035 --> 00:03:06.239
There's no question about it.
That was a route.

00:03:06.305 --> 00:03:08.911
It's nothing,
but I appreciate that.

00:03:08.978 --> 00:03:11.683
Oh, come on.
Why do you have to be so humble?

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.055
It's quite the accomplishment
to get all of our players

00:03:14.121 --> 00:03:15.290
on the winning podium.

00:03:15.658 --> 00:03:17.428
[Mayumi] Whether you're willing
to admit it or not,

00:03:17.494 --> 00:03:19.566
that's all thanks
to your engineering skills,

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:21.369
which is just a matter
of fact the rest

00:03:21.436 --> 00:03:22.706
of us here all recognize.

00:03:22.772 --> 00:03:25.243
I have a hard time believing it
as well.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.747
It's like being under
the illusion

00:03:26.814 --> 00:03:29.151
that my magical skills
suddenly improved.

00:03:29.485 --> 00:03:31.890
Especially in regard
to Miss Kitayama's magic.

00:03:31.957 --> 00:03:34.462
The university
has already approached us.

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:36.032
They'd like
to officially register

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.038
that new technique into
the Magic University's index.

00:03:39.105 --> 00:03:40.373
Hold on.
Does that mean the school

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.344
would adopt it as a new type
of magic?

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:45.785
[Tatsuya] Is that correct?

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.691
When they inquire
who developed it,

00:03:48.758 --> 00:03:51.095
make sure to only give
Miss Kitayama's name.

00:03:51.162 --> 00:03:52.732
What?
We can't possibly do that.

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.070
It was your original idea,
Tatsuya.

00:03:55.605 --> 00:03:57.976
It's the first person to use
a new type of magic

00:03:58.042 --> 00:04:00.748
who is customarily considered
to be the originator

00:04:00.815 --> 00:04:01.717
of the arcane.

00:04:01.784 --> 00:04:02.986
You know,

00:04:03.052 --> 00:04:06.192
being overly modest
can sound like sarcasm.

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:07.494
[Tatsuya] It's not modesty.

00:04:07.562 --> 00:04:09.031
Then what is the big deal here?

00:04:09.098 --> 00:04:10.400
Truthfully,

00:04:10.467 --> 00:04:12.104
I'm simply trying
to spare myself

00:04:12.171 --> 00:04:13.674
from any public humiliation.

00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:15.878
Not being able to use
the magic I developed

00:04:15.945 --> 00:04:18.483
would be embarrassing
if people knew I invented it.

00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:21.489
How exactly did you confirm
the operability of magic

00:04:21.557 --> 00:04:23.126
you can't use yourself?

00:04:23.493 --> 00:04:25.397
[Tatsuya] It isn't like
I can't use it at all.

00:04:25.731 --> 00:04:27.234
It's just it would take far
too long

00:04:27.301 --> 00:04:29.138
for me to activate it.

00:04:29.573 --> 00:04:32.277
I'm not at the level
I could effectively utilize it.

00:04:32.344 --> 00:04:33.781
[Mayumi] Come on, now!
Forget about that!

00:04:33.848 --> 00:04:35.050
Both of you,
can we just agree

00:04:35.117 --> 00:04:36.920
that it's not worth
worrying over, please?

00:04:36.987 --> 00:04:39.091
We did get off
to a good start today after all,

00:04:39.158 --> 00:04:40.293
wouldn't you say?

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.897
Tatsuya, listen.

00:04:41.964 --> 00:04:44.368
I'm counting on you to keep
this up for us, all right?

00:04:45.003 --> 00:04:46.038
[grunts]

00:04:48.944 --> 00:04:51.617
<i>[Tatsuya] It is a good start,</i>
<i>isn't it?</i>

00:04:53.019 --> 00:04:55.992
<i>[Boy] Masaki, about that stunt</i>
<i>First High pulled.</i>

00:04:56.527 --> 00:04:57.996
You're saying it wasn't due
to the talents

00:04:58.062 --> 00:04:59.365
of those three girls?

00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:00.968
Absolutely.

00:05:01.035 --> 00:05:04.810
Kitayama who came in first today
showed superb magic skills

00:05:04.876 --> 00:05:07.181
but the second
and third place finishers

00:05:07.247 --> 00:05:10.153
didn't strike me as being
all that exceptional in nature.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.424
Based on magic power,
well,

00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:14.228
there's simply no way
that First High

00:05:14.295 --> 00:05:15.965
would have swept silver
and bronze.

00:05:16.032 --> 00:05:17.267
And besides,

00:05:17.334 --> 00:05:18.403
we're maintaining a strong lead

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:20.340
in the Battle Board event
so far.

00:05:20.407 --> 00:05:23.279
I don't envision First High
as having standouts only among

00:05:23.346 --> 00:05:24.616
their first years.

00:05:24.683 --> 00:05:26.587
George is correct
in saying that.

00:05:26.653 --> 00:05:29.091
We didn't lose
in terms of talent level.

00:05:29.593 --> 00:05:32.097
Which could mean
there's another factor

00:05:32.164 --> 00:05:33.399
in play here.

00:05:34.368 --> 00:05:36.372
Their engineer.
It must be.

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:37.909
I'll bet their
first‐year engineer

00:05:37.976 --> 00:05:38.844
who they have in charge

00:05:38.911 --> 00:05:40.380
of the girls'
Speed Shooting event

00:05:40.447 --> 00:05:42.919
must have a mind‐blowing
technical skill set.

00:05:42.986 --> 00:05:44.789
My thoughts exactly.

00:05:44.856 --> 00:05:48.564
George, that device
the first place girl used,

00:05:48.631 --> 00:05:50.100
did you notice it?

00:05:50.166 --> 00:05:51.335
[grunts]

00:05:51.402 --> 00:05:53.373
I believe it was
a general model, right?

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:54.743
What?
No way.

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:56.647
But didn't it have
auxiliary sights?

00:05:56.713 --> 00:05:58.551
That's right.
How's that possible?

00:05:58.617 --> 00:06:00.120
I've never heard
of a generalized device

00:06:00.186 --> 00:06:01.188
in rifle form.

00:06:01.255 --> 00:06:02.592
I've never seen any such thing

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:04.261
in a manufacturer's catalog.

00:06:04.328 --> 00:06:05.698
You're not wrong.

00:06:05.765 --> 00:06:07.869
They probably haven't made it
to the market yet,

00:06:07.936 --> 00:06:10.240
but there actually is such
a thing as a generalized device

00:06:10.307 --> 00:06:12.579
with auxiliary sights that
are integrated into it.

00:06:12.645 --> 00:06:14.248
[Boy 2] Hold on.
Seriously?

00:06:14.315 --> 00:06:15.785
It's some
cutting edge technology

00:06:15.851 --> 00:06:18.389
that was unveiled last summer
in Dusseldorf, Germany.

00:06:18.456 --> 00:06:19.893
It was that recently?

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.331
And they've already put
that technology to actual use?

00:06:22.397 --> 00:06:23.499
‐ [Shinkurou] Right.
‐ [gasps]

00:06:23.567 --> 00:06:24.836
[Shinkurou] I forgot
about it myself

00:06:24.903 --> 00:06:27.107
until today's outcome
reminded me to look into it.

00:06:27.174 --> 00:06:29.445
I'm impressed that you knew
about it, Kichijouji.

00:06:29.512 --> 00:06:30.881
It's no wonder
that you're considered

00:06:30.948 --> 00:06:31.917
the team's brain.

00:06:31.984 --> 00:06:32.952
[grunts]

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:35.123
Still, the prototype that
was announced

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.929
and shown in Dusseldorf
most likely wasn't suitable

00:06:37.996 --> 00:06:39.164
for practical usage.

00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:42.037
It seemed rather clunky
and it was very imprecise.

00:06:42.104 --> 00:06:43.807
In reality the device
was nothing more

00:06:43.874 --> 00:06:45.544
than a mere proof
of concept mock up

00:06:45.611 --> 00:06:47.080
that they just stuck together.

00:06:47.815 --> 00:06:49.251
Yet today despite that,

00:06:49.318 --> 00:06:52.424
the apparatus Miss Kitayama
of First High School employed

00:06:52.491 --> 00:06:55.130
combined the efficiency
of a personal CAD

00:06:55.196 --> 00:06:58.002
with the means to process
different activation sequences,

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:00.106
and that is the benefit
of utilizing

00:07:00.173 --> 00:07:02.912
a generalized device.
Consider the meaning.

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:06.987
If a single engineer was the one
who made all that possible,

00:07:07.054 --> 00:07:09.826
then it's far beyond
high school level.

00:07:09.893 --> 00:07:12.164
[Masaki] It's the work
of a beast.

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:15.036
So you think
he's talented enough

00:07:15.103 --> 00:07:16.238
for you to say that?

00:07:16.305 --> 00:07:18.276
Masaki is right to be concerned.

00:07:18.343 --> 00:07:19.713
However, it's physically
impossible

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:22.552
for one engineer to be in charge
of every event.

00:07:22.952 --> 00:07:25.591
[Masaki] For whatever contest
their wonder king is working on,

00:07:25.658 --> 00:07:27.829
we'll be facing
an uphill battle.

00:07:27.895 --> 00:07:30.668
Remember, everyone.
In future matches,

00:07:30.735 --> 00:07:32.605
we should take the field knowing
that device‐wise,

00:07:32.672 --> 00:07:34.709
we're in the hole

Well, I was thinking about
heading back to our lodgings,

00:07:53.814 --> 00:07:55.483
but since I'm already out here,

00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:56.820
I figured I should swing by
and see

00:07:56.887 --> 00:07:58.289
if you two wanted any help.

00:07:58.356 --> 00:07:59.458
Oh, my gosh.
Seriously?

00:07:59.526 --> 00:08:01.262
In that case,
by all means,

00:08:01.329 --> 00:08:03.266
take a look at my CAD!

00:08:03.701 --> 00:08:05.103
Tone it down a little, Honoka.

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:07.207
You should realize putting it
that way is rude

00:08:07.274 --> 00:08:08.209
to Miss Nakajou.

00:08:08.276 --> 00:08:09.244
Oh!

00:08:09.311 --> 00:08:10.781
Sorry about that.

00:08:10.848 --> 00:08:12.819
Oh, it's all good.
Really, don't worry.

00:08:12.885 --> 00:08:15.190
I totally get you didn't mean it
like that.

00:08:15.256 --> 00:08:16.560
[Tatsuya] All right, then.

00:08:16.626 --> 00:08:18.096
In that case,

00:08:18.162 --> 00:08:20.801
let me rethink your strategy
for getting through the prelims.

00:08:21.503 --> 00:08:23.974

[beeping]

00:08:29.351 --> 00:08:30.521
[Azusa] Hey, Tatsuya.

00:08:30.588 --> 00:08:32.391
Why did you load up
Miss Mitsui's CAD

00:08:32.457 --> 00:08:35.531
with so many optical
activation sequences prepared?

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:37.668
The Battle Board rules state:

00:08:37.735 --> 00:08:40.173
"Using magic to interfere
with other contestants

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.375
is prohibited."

00:08:41.743 --> 00:08:43.346
However, those rules
don't bar players

00:08:43.413 --> 00:08:44.549
from hindering each other,

00:08:44.616 --> 00:08:46.152
as the result
of magically interfering

00:08:46.218 --> 00:08:48.289
with the surface
of the water itself.

00:08:48.356 --> 00:08:50.594
What are these for?
Hmm?

Tatsuya, did you see me?
I came in first place!

I saw you.
All of us were watching.

Nicely done.

Oh.

That means the world to me.
Thank you.

00:10:30.528 --> 00:10:32.230
<i>[Mayumi] Well, the good news</i>

00:10:32.297 --> 00:10:34.702
<i>as the runner up</i>
<i>in the boys' Speed Shooting.</i>

00:10:35.103 --> 00:10:37.575
So I assume the other two boys
got knocked out, then?

00:10:38.042 --> 00:10:39.344
[Mayumi] There's
a big difference

00:10:39.411 --> 00:10:41.917
in the results for the boys
and the girls, huh?

00:10:42.317 --> 00:10:45.356
At this rate if we can't find
a way out of this slump of ours,

00:10:45.423 --> 00:10:46.927
even if we fair well,

00:10:46.993 --> 00:10:49.498
there might be repercussions
going forward.

00:10:49.866 --> 00:10:52.204
I'm starting to think that
our team may just need

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:53.574
a boost to morale.

[both exhaling]

[Man] I thought Third High
was supposed to be

00:11:00.888 --> 00:11:03.192
the front‐runner
for the rookie competitions.

00:11:03.259 --> 00:11:04.696
[Man 2] After going
to the trouble

00:11:04.762 --> 00:11:07.000
of orchestrating
Watanabe's withdrawal.

00:11:07.434 --> 00:11:08.704
Nothing we did may matter.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:11.776
At this rate First High will
end up winning despite that.

00:11:11.843 --> 00:11:14.047
As book makers,
if the favorite wins,

00:11:14.114 --> 00:11:15.450
then we'd be the biggest losers
out here,

00:11:15.518 --> 00:11:16.653
for Pete's sake.

00:11:16.987 --> 00:11:18.222
[Man 3] Not to mention the fact
that we drew

00:11:18.289 --> 00:11:20.961
that we drew an especially
large crowd this time.

00:11:21.028 --> 00:11:22.932
Won't be cheap for us
to pay out dividends

00:11:22.999 --> 00:11:25.169
to every winner.
When that happens,

00:11:25.236 --> 00:11:28.242
it's sure to put a huge dent
in our business this term,

00:11:28.309 --> 00:11:31.683
and that would mean every one
of us at the table

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:34.454
will be violently purged
from the No Head Dragon.

00:11:35.156 --> 00:11:36.960
[Man] Depending on the size
of our losses,

00:11:37.027 --> 00:11:38.897

[Man 2] If it were just dying,
it wouldn't be so bad.

[Miyuki] I just heard this
from Shizuku.

Brother, you turned down
the honor of having

your name added
to the index.

00:12:47.768 --> 00:12:49.071
Is that correct?

00:12:49.706 --> 00:12:51.075
Yeah.

00:12:51.743 --> 00:12:53.112
Why do you do that?

00:12:53.179 --> 00:12:55.751
Was it out of consideration
for our aunt's wishes?

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.788
[Tatsuya] It was.

[whimpers]

00:12:58.957 --> 00:13:00.159
[Tatsuya] Magic University

research capabilities.

00:13:02.898 --> 00:13:05.638
It's not far fetched to think
they could uncover and expose

00:13:07.842 --> 00:13:09.244
Plus the Yotsubas,

00:13:09.311 --> 00:13:11.516
they want the info
to remain secret along

with my link to the family.

00:13:13.954 --> 00:13:16.025
I still don't have
sufficient power.

Going one‐on‐one,

00:13:18.262 --> 00:13:20.099

could defeat the Queen

00:13:22.538 --> 00:13:23.807
After all,

00:13:23.874 --> 00:13:26.445
my decomposition magic
is highly compatible

00:13:26.513 --> 00:13:28.115
