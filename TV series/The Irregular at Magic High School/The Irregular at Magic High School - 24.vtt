00:10:14.529 --> 00:10:17.067
[gunfire]

00:10:20.508 --> 00:10:21.610
[chuckles]

00:10:21.676 --> 00:10:22.979
[Tatsuya] The enemy
is firing off

00:10:23.045 --> 00:10:26.018
special anti‐magician
high speed bullets.

00:10:26.085 --> 00:10:27.254
Tatsuya.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.489
You are merciless.

00:10:28.557 --> 00:10:31.028
[Shizuku] But thanks to him,
Leo's been spared.

00:10:31.763 --> 00:10:32.865
[Tatsuya] Miyuki,

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:35.036
could you silence
the enemy's gunfire?

00:10:35.103 --> 00:10:36.807
[Miyuki] Very well, brother.

00:10:36.873 --> 00:10:40.246
However, in order to deal
with so many combatants at once,

00:10:40.313 --> 00:10:41.315
I'll have to‐‐

00:10:41.382 --> 00:10:42.985
[Tatsuya] Yes, I know.

00:10:45.089 --> 00:10:46.325
Uh...

00:10:47.327 --> 00:10:48.262
[exhales]

00:10:54.809 --> 00:10:57.314
[magical whirring]

00:11:06.265 --> 00:11:07.835
Huh?
[grunts]

00:11:07.902 --> 00:11:09.672
Huh?
[gasps]

00:11:12.678 --> 00:11:14.582
[all grunting]
[squelching]

00:11:14.649 --> 00:11:15.985
[all shouting]

00:11:17.187 --> 00:11:19.491
[breathing heavily]
[shouts]

00:11:19.792 --> 00:11:21.161
[blows landing]

00:11:21.228 --> 00:11:22.698
[grunting]

00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:24.101
[groaning]

00:11:26.105 --> 00:11:27.073
Whoa!

00:11:27.775 --> 00:11:30.246
[booming]

00:11:30.313 --> 00:11:32.818
[all panting]

00:11:34.321 --> 00:11:36.660
[Leonhard exhales]
I never even got a chance.

00:11:36.726 --> 00:11:38.029
There, there.

00:11:42.505 --> 00:11:43.907
[both gasping]

00:11:46.546 --> 00:11:48.115
[Tatsuya] My apologies.

00:11:48.182 --> 00:11:49.919
Was that a little too much
for you two?

00:11:49.986 --> 00:11:52.090
[Honoka gasps]
No, I'm all right.

00:11:52.758 --> 00:11:54.127
[Mizuki] Me, too.
No need to worry.

00:11:54.194 --> 00:11:55.698
‐ I'm fine.
‐ [Tatsuya grunts]

00:11:56.465 --> 00:11:58.469
[Leonhard] So, uh,
what's the plan now?

00:11:59.304 --> 00:12:00.641
We need intel.

00:12:01.041 --> 00:12:02.979
Apparently something bigger
and more serious

00:12:03.045 --> 00:12:05.183
than we anticipated
is going on.

00:12:05.551 --> 00:12:06.786
[Tatsuya] If we wing it,

00:12:06.853 --> 00:12:09.692
we could find ourselves
in dire straights.

00:12:09.759 --> 00:12:11.128
All right, then.
[both gasping]

00:12:11.195 --> 00:12:13.132
Use the VIP conference room.

00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:15.203
The convention center
holds meetings

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.508
for politicians
and businesses up there.

00:12:17.575 --> 00:12:19.545
So you should be able
to access all kinds

00:12:19.612 --> 00:12:21.181
of information.

00:12:21.248 --> 00:12:23.987
[Erika] I'm impressed you would
know about a room like that.

00:12:24.054 --> 00:12:25.591
[Shizuku] Well, my dad came here
for work

00:12:25.658 --> 00:12:28.029
and brought me along once
so I know the security key

00:12:28.095 --> 00:12:29.398
and access code, too.

00:12:30.099 --> 00:12:31.402
All right, Shizuku.

00:12:31.468 --> 00:12:32.505
[Tatsuya] Lead the way.

00:12:32.571 --> 00:12:34.074
[grunts]

00:12:41.623 --> 00:12:44.529
[computer beeping]

00:12:50.908 --> 00:12:52.612
[Erika] Whoa, what's this?

00:12:52.979 --> 00:12:55.016
Geez, that is so far beyond
messed up.

00:12:57.454 --> 00:12:58.724
[Miyuki] Brother?

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.360
‐ [gasps]
‐ [exhales]

00:13:01.796 --> 00:13:03.099
[chuckles]

00:13:03.165 --> 00:13:04.234
[gasps]

00:13:04.869 --> 00:13:05.971
[inhales sharply]

00:13:06.038 --> 00:13:07.575
[Tatsuya] This doesn't
look good, guys.

00:13:08.142 --> 00:13:10.179
If we remain here
for much longer,

00:13:10.246 --> 00:13:12.551
the enemy will
most likely capture us.

00:13:12.618 --> 00:13:13.887
Nevertheless,

00:13:13.954 --> 00:13:16.793
we're stuck
with no viable transportation.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.331
Then should we evacuate
to that shelter?

00:13:19.398 --> 00:13:21.503
It would be
the most practical option.

00:13:21.569 --> 00:13:23.507
So we'll take
the underground tunnel?

00:13:23.573 --> 00:13:24.742
No.

00:13:24.809 --> 00:13:26.245
‐ Above ground.
‐ Huh?

00:13:26.312 --> 00:13:27.548
But why?

00:13:27.615 --> 00:13:28.784
[gasps]

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.420
[Erika] Right, of course!

00:13:30.486 --> 00:13:31.656
[Leonhard] Huh?

00:13:31.723 --> 00:13:34.328
However, I would still like
a little more time before

00:13:34.394 --> 00:13:35.631
we head over there.

00:13:35.698 --> 00:13:37.467
[Honoka] Huh?
Why's that?

00:13:37.835 --> 00:13:40.039
I'm destroying the demo devices.

00:13:47.487 --> 00:13:48.590
[gasps]

00:13:48.657 --> 00:13:49.992
What are you all
still doing here?

00:13:50.059 --> 00:13:52.497
‐ [gasps]
‐ I'm deleting the data,

00:13:52.565 --> 00:13:54.368
so it won't get stolen.

00:13:54.434 --> 00:13:56.238
[Tatsuya] What about
the rest of you?

00:13:56.305 --> 00:13:59.277
We can't just run off
and leave you behind,

00:13:59.344 --> 00:14:00.614
now can we?

00:14:00.681 --> 00:14:02.484
[Katsuto] Shiba.
Saegusa.

00:14:03.152 --> 00:14:04.488
[Tatsuya] Yes, Juumonji?

00:14:04.555 --> 00:14:06.726
I was under the impression you
had gone ahead

00:14:06.793 --> 00:14:08.195
and evacuated already.

00:14:08.262 --> 00:14:10.701
[Mari] We stayed to delete
the data.

00:14:10.768 --> 00:14:13.406
And does it take over
a dozen people to do that?

00:14:13.472 --> 00:14:15.644
President Nakajou has taken all
the other students

00:14:15.711 --> 00:14:17.648
to the subterranean passageway.

00:14:17.715 --> 00:14:18.784
You should follow her.

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:20.186
The underground tunnel?

00:14:20.253 --> 00:14:21.756
‐ [grunts]
‐ Yes, why?

00:14:21.823 --> 00:14:22.825
Is something the matter?

00:14:22.992 --> 00:14:24.194
[Tatsuya] No.

00:14:24.261 --> 00:14:26.065
I'm just a little concerned,
that's all,

00:14:26.131 --> 00:14:28.069
since the underground
tunnel isn't a direct route.

00:14:28.135 --> 00:14:29.371
[both gasping]

00:14:29.438 --> 00:14:32.010
It is possible they might
run into other groups.

00:14:32.077 --> 00:14:34.314
‐ Therefore‐‐
‐ They can be attacked.

00:14:34.381 --> 00:14:35.951
If that happens,

00:14:36.018 --> 00:14:37.387
they could very well be forced

00:14:37.454 --> 00:14:39.057
into a head‐on
clash underground.

00:14:39.124 --> 00:14:40.828
Hey, Hattori, Sawaki,

00:14:40.894 --> 00:14:42.832
go after Nakajou.
Hurry.

00:14:43.099 --> 00:14:44.769
‐ [Hattori] Right.
‐ [Midori] Yes, sir.

00:14:44.836 --> 00:14:47.207
[Katsuto] I'm going to go patrol
the area

00:14:47.273 --> 00:14:48.744
and look for any stragglers.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:49.879
Kirihara.

00:14:50.246 --> 00:14:51.448
[Kirihara] Yes, sir!

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:53.219
Shiba, can I ask you
to take care

00:14:53.285 --> 00:14:55.323
of the devices left
in the other room?

00:14:56.125 --> 00:14:58.229
[Mari] Meet in the green room
when we're done.

00:14:58.597 --> 00:15:01.101
We can figure out our next move
in there together.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.683
<i>[Man] That's an order.</i>
<i>Obey it.</i>

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.052
<i>Roger that.</i>

00:15:16.733 --> 00:15:18.002
[Mari] Now then,

00:15:18.068 --> 00:15:20.039
let's discuss what we're going
to do next.

00:15:23.145 --> 00:15:26.185
Only one enemy ship has invaded
our harbor.

00:15:26.251 --> 00:15:28.222
Despite this,
the area around the shore

00:15:28.289 --> 00:15:29.959
is more or less under
the enemy's control.

00:15:30.026 --> 00:15:31.328
[exhales]

00:15:31.395 --> 00:15:33.567
[Mayumi] Ground transport
is at a standstill, too.

00:15:34.134 --> 00:15:36.038
That may be the work
of guerrilla fighters.

00:15:36.706 --> 00:15:39.077
What on Earth could
these soldiers be after, though?

00:15:39.745 --> 00:15:42.183
[Mayumi] The fact that
they've targeted Yokohama

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:43.787
means they must
be after something

00:15:43.854 --> 00:15:45.524
that only exists here.

00:15:46.091 --> 00:15:48.730
Though technically
there's also one in Kyoto.

00:15:48.797 --> 00:15:50.801
[Mari] The Magic Association!

00:15:50.868 --> 00:15:52.403
Well, to be precise,

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:55.511
they're after the branch
office's main database.

00:15:56.111 --> 00:15:58.583
All the crucial data's being
centrally managed

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:00.386
in Kyoto and Yokohama.

00:16:00.453 --> 00:16:02.958
When is the rescue ship supposed
to arrive?

00:16:03.025 --> 00:16:05.931
It should be reaching the docks
in another ten minutes.

00:16:06.533 --> 00:16:08.804
Unfortunately it doesn't look
like it has the capacity

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:10.006
for this large a group
of people.

00:16:10.072 --> 00:16:11.175
[beeps]
[grunts]

00:16:11.241 --> 00:16:12.845
About Miss Nakajou
and the others

00:16:12.912 --> 00:16:14.314
who've headed for the shelter.

00:16:14.381 --> 00:16:16.920
Unfortunately, it would appear
that Shiba's concerns

00:16:16.986 --> 00:16:18.455
for the tunnel were dead on.

00:16:18.523 --> 00:16:21.128
However, this enemy force
is relatively small.

00:16:21.195 --> 00:16:23.265
So they should be able
to drive them away

00:16:23.332 --> 00:16:25.671
pretty quickly according
to Hattori.

00:16:26.238 --> 00:16:28.610
[Mari] You've all been briefed
on the situation.

00:16:29.177 --> 00:16:31.716
We have no chance
of getting onto that ship.

00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:34.120
At this point,
even if it's somewhat risky,

00:16:34.187 --> 00:16:36.191
I believe our only option
is to make our way

00:16:36.258 --> 00:16:37.561
to the shelter at the station.

00:16:37.628 --> 00:16:40.767
[Mari] I‐‐I agree
with Miss Watanabe's opinion.

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:42.303
And brother?

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.188
[gun cocking]
[gasps]

00:16:51.255 --> 00:16:52.357
What are you doing?

00:16:52.423 --> 00:16:54.160
‐ Hey.
‐ What's wrong, Tatsuya?

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:06.553
[gasping]

00:17:11.629 --> 00:17:15.236
[groaning]

00:17:22.417 --> 00:17:23.485
Tatsuya?

00:17:24.989 --> 00:17:26.291
What was that?

00:17:27.126 --> 00:17:28.295
[grunts]

00:17:29.097 --> 00:17:30.266
[door opens]
Huh?

00:17:30.333 --> 00:17:31.836
‐ [Kyouko] I'm here now.
‐ [gasps]

00:17:31.903 --> 00:17:33.239
[gasps]

00:17:34.007 --> 00:17:36.044
[Mayumi] Is‐‐is that you,
Miss Kyouko?

00:17:36.478 --> 00:17:39.117
Long time no see,
Miss Saegusa.

00:17:51.008 --> 00:17:53.078
[distant booming]
[gasps]

00:17:53.145 --> 00:17:55.283
[booming]

[grunts]

00:18:05.637 --> 00:18:06.806
[booming]

00:18:08.208 --> 00:18:11.114
So they're using
a super sonic launcher.

00:18:15.022 --> 00:18:16.960
[car approaches]

00:18:17.026 --> 00:18:19.297
Hey, are you with the 101st?

00:18:19.364 --> 00:18:22.136
[Shigeru] The Japanese Self
Defense Force's 101st

00:18:22.203 --> 00:18:24.441
independent magic
equipped battalion.

00:18:24.508 --> 00:18:26.512
And I'm Captain Shigeru Sanada.

00:18:26.579 --> 00:18:28.750
Wow, to think you already know
about us.

00:18:28.817 --> 00:18:30.119
I guess that's expected

00:18:30.186 --> 00:18:31.756
of the head
of the Juumonji clan.

00:18:31.823 --> 00:18:33.292
I am impressed.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:34.762
[grunts]

00:18:35.597 --> 00:18:36.532
Pardon me,

00:18:36.599 --> 00:18:38.435
but we should both
probably abstain

00:18:38.503 --> 00:18:40.607
from such gratuitous chatter.

00:18:41.074 --> 00:18:43.112
On the contrary,
excuse me.

00:18:43.178 --> 00:18:44.214
Huh?

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.383
[Shigeru] Now then,

00:18:45.449 --> 00:18:47.186
heir apparent
of the Juumonji clan,

00:18:47.253 --> 00:18:48.122
please come this way.

00:18:48.188 --> 00:18:49.357
[groans]

[Katsuto] Shiba?

00:19:19.184 --> 00:19:21.021
Major Harunobu Kazama.

00:19:21.088 --> 00:19:22.958
We are with the JSDF.

00:19:23.025 --> 00:19:24.427
[gasps]

00:19:24.929 --> 00:19:27.266
Ah, so you're the Major
Harunobu Kazama

00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:28.870
I've heard so much about.

00:19:28.937 --> 00:19:32.143
I'm an acting master clan
conference representative.

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:34.180
Katsuto of the Juumonji clan.

00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:38.355
[all gasping]

00:19:38.923 --> 00:19:40.493
Second Lieutenant Fujibayashi.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.931
Given the rundown
on our current situation.

00:19:42.998 --> 00:19:44.100
Right.

00:19:44.167 --> 00:19:45.771
[beeping]

00:19:45.837 --> 00:19:46.839
[Kyouko] At this time,

00:19:46.906 --> 00:19:49.077
our forces stationed
at Hodogaya are battling

00:19:49.144 --> 00:19:50.413
the invaders.

00:19:50.914 --> 00:19:54.354
We also have one battalion each
from Tsurumi and Fujisawa

00:19:54.421 --> 00:19:56.058
rushing to this site.

00:19:56.124 --> 00:19:58.462
The Kanto branch
of the Magic Association

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.567
has taken its own
defensive position.

00:20:00.634 --> 00:20:01.769
Well done.

00:20:01.836 --> 00:20:03.338
Special officer.

00:20:03.707 --> 00:20:06.244
IN light of these
unique circumstances,

00:20:06.311 --> 00:20:08.182
our battalion which
had been on its way

00:20:08.248 --> 00:20:09.819
to Hodogaya
on a separate mission

00:20:09.885 --> 00:20:12.256
has just been ordered
to add our tactical support

00:20:12.323 --> 00:20:13.760
to the city defense.

00:20:13.827 --> 00:20:16.498
In accordance with the special
assignment regulations,

00:20:16.566 --> 00:20:18.970
I hereby order you
to mobilize as well.

[Harunobu] The Japanese
self defense force requests

00:20:27.019 --> 00:20:30.761
that this special officer's rank
remains confidential.

00:20:31.328 --> 00:20:32.698
Please be aware this is based

00:20:32.765 --> 00:20:35.069
on the JSDF's secrecy
protection law.

00:20:35.136 --> 00:20:37.373
I hope you all can understand.

00:20:39.377 --> 00:20:40.814
[Sanada] Shiba.

00:20:41.181 --> 00:20:43.485
In our trailer we have
the mobile suit you designed

00:20:43.553 --> 00:20:45.256
ready for you to put on.

00:20:45.322 --> 00:20:46.592
Let's hurry.

00:20:46.959 --> 00:20:48.495
[Kyouko] Well,
as for everybody else,

00:20:48.563 --> 00:20:50.700
my squad
and I offer you protection.

00:20:53.305 --> 00:20:55.510
Sorry.
You all heard what they said.

00:20:55.577 --> 00:20:57.346
You should head out
with the upper classmen.

00:20:57.413 --> 00:20:58.983
Evacuate to the shelter.

00:20:59.819 --> 00:21:01.321

Please, wait a moment.

What in the heck?

I can't believe it!

00:22:16.071 --> 00:22:17.508
There you go, brother.

00:22:19.612 --> 00:22:21.047
You've got free reign now.

00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:27.895
I'm off, then.
