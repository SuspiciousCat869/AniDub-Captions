[Miyuki grunts]

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.742
[grunts]

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.050

[exhales]

00:00:37.976 --> 00:00:39.145
Who's there?

00:00:42.218 --> 00:00:43.486
Hey, Haruka.

00:00:43.554 --> 00:00:44.723
Huh?

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:49.031
I never would have imagined
that Shiba would catch on

00:00:49.098 --> 00:00:50.969
to me let alone you, Master.

00:00:51.035 --> 00:00:53.173
To pull the wool
over Tatsuya's eyes,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.110
you have to disguise
your presence,

00:00:55.177 --> 00:00:56.981
not attempt to extinguish it.

00:00:57.047 --> 00:00:58.149
I see that now.

00:00:58.216 --> 00:01:01.055
I guess I learned
something today.

00:01:01.557 --> 00:01:04.262
So what brings you
to the temple tonight, Miss Ono?

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.700
[Yakumo] You can let
your guard down, you know.

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:09.806
It just so happens Haruka's
a student of mine.

00:01:09.873 --> 00:01:12.144
I'm very sorry for intruding.

00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:14.549
I saw you practicing
the Mirage Bat technique.

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:18.023
[Haruka] So, are you entering
the Nine Schools Competition?

00:01:18.089 --> 00:01:19.258
‐ Well, I‐‐
‐ That's correct.

00:01:19.325 --> 00:01:20.895
Miss Miyuki will be competing

00:01:20.962 --> 00:01:22.231
in the Mirage Bat tournament

00:01:22.298 --> 00:01:24.435
as well as in
the ice pillars break contest.

00:01:24.503 --> 00:01:27.742
You're in two competitions?
That's amazing!

00:01:29.078 --> 00:01:30.147
It would be nice if you

00:01:30.213 --> 00:01:31.784
could answer my question
as well.

00:01:32.552 --> 00:01:34.890
Hmm?
Well, Haruka,

00:01:34.957 --> 00:01:36.426
would you mind telling them?

00:01:36.492 --> 00:01:39.198
Even if I were to say no,
you would just tell them anyway

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:40.501
as soon as I leave, right?

00:01:41.035 --> 00:01:44.175
[Yakumo] Well, since she herself
gave me permission,

00:01:44.241 --> 00:01:47.749
Haruka here
is a public safety investigator

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:49.051
for the police department.

00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:50.555
To be precise,

00:01:50.622 --> 00:01:52.792
I only recently became
a secret investigator

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:55.932
for public safety after I
was hired as a counselor

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:57.001
at First High School.

00:01:57.067 --> 00:01:58.470
[Haruka] By the way,

00:01:58.537 --> 00:02:01.777
since I started studying
ninjutsu under Master Kokonoe

00:02:01.844 --> 00:02:02.879
about two years ago,

00:02:02.946 --> 00:02:05.652
that makes you
my senior apprentice, Shiba.

00:02:05.985 --> 00:02:07.922
If that's true
then your concealment spell

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:09.291
was quite impressive.

00:02:09.358 --> 00:02:11.997
That kind of magic
is my specialty.

00:02:12.064 --> 00:02:13.333
[Tatsuya] I see.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.805
So you're a b. s. magician, then.

00:02:16.272 --> 00:02:18.476
I don't appreciate
being referred to that way.

00:02:20.414 --> 00:02:22.786
[Haruka] Normally my status
as an investigator

00:02:22.852 --> 00:02:24.322
would be confidential.

00:02:24.388 --> 00:02:26.860
I'm counting on you
to keep it that way.

00:02:26.927 --> 00:02:28.263
I suppose I can.

00:02:28.631 --> 00:02:30.968
[Tatsuya] Then,
in exchange...

00:02:31.603 --> 00:02:35.778
If you hear of any other plots,
will you inform me in advance?

00:02:35.845 --> 00:02:36.914
[scoffs]

Sure.

then.

You don't call them shorts.

Magic University

Affiliated High Schools
around Japan,

00:07:03.547 --> 00:07:06.352
this competition
is very high profile.

00:07:06.753 --> 00:07:08.590
The essay contest
held every fall

00:07:08.657 --> 00:07:10.160
is research‐based.

00:07:10.561 --> 00:07:12.197
Meanwhile,
in the summer competition,

00:07:12.264 --> 00:07:15.871
schools go head‐to‐head
in sports‐type magic contests.

00:07:15.938 --> 00:07:17.341
Of course since
the school's honor

00:07:17.407 --> 00:07:18.611
is on the line,

00:07:18.677 --> 00:07:21.215
the contestants are chosen based
on merit.

00:07:21.282 --> 00:07:22.719
Does that mean,
then,

00:07:22.785 --> 00:07:24.288
that the student
council's taking

00:07:24.355 --> 00:07:25.992
the lead
and preparing for it all?

Yes, we finalized
our athletic roster thanks

but still.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.041
The issue is finding engineers.

Staffing up the technical crew.

00:07:36.847 --> 00:07:38.951
So then you're still short
on engineers?

00:07:39.018 --> 00:07:40.020
[Mayumi] Yes.

00:07:40.387 --> 00:07:43.026
The third year class
is particularly skewed towards

00:07:43.092 --> 00:07:44.663
a practical skill set.

00:07:44.729 --> 00:07:45.965
As for the second years,

00:07:46.032 --> 00:07:48.637
we do have Ah‐chan
and Isori, but...

00:07:49.338 --> 00:07:51.175
You mean Kei Isori?

00:07:51.242 --> 00:07:52.612
If I remember correctly,

00:07:52.679 --> 00:07:54.148
I'd say he's more
of a pure theorist

00:07:54.214 --> 00:07:56.553
and not to adept at fine tuning
and practice.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.089
[exhales sharply]

00:07:58.156 --> 00:08:01.863
If only you could find a way
to fine tune your own CAD, Mari.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.701
My job would be so much easier.

00:08:04.068 --> 00:08:06.673
Well then,
we do have a serious problem.

00:08:09.779 --> 00:08:11.182
Rin, my dearest friend!

00:08:11.248 --> 00:08:13.252
Would you reconsider being
an engineer?

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:14.288
Sorry.

00:08:14.355 --> 00:08:15.691
With my skills,

00:08:15.758 --> 00:08:17.595
I believe I'd only
end up thwarting Miss Nakajou

00:08:17.662 --> 00:08:18.864
and the others.

00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:20.701
[groans]

00:08:23.072 --> 00:08:25.076
[Tatsuya] All right,
I'll be heading out now.

00:08:26.178 --> 00:08:27.147
[Azusa gasps]

00:08:27.214 --> 00:08:28.449
Um, if that's the case,

00:08:28.517 --> 00:08:30.120
then wouldn't Tatsuya fit
the bill?

00:08:30.186 --> 00:08:31.990
After all,
it seems pretty clear.

00:08:32.057 --> 00:08:34.328
He's the one
who adjusts Miyuki's CAD.

00:08:34.395 --> 00:08:35.497
‐ Huh?
‐ [exhales]

00:08:35.564 --> 00:08:36.900
both: Huh?

00:08:39.806 --> 00:08:41.175
Talk about a blind spot!

00:08:41.242 --> 00:08:42.512
That's perfect.

00:08:43.046 --> 00:08:45.183
I must be slipping.
How did I not think of that?

00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:46.987
[gasps]

00:08:47.487 --> 00:08:49.425
[grunting]

00:08:49.491 --> 00:08:52.230
A first year's never been put
on technical staff,

00:08:52.297 --> 00:08:53.433
if I'm not mistaken.

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:55.805
There has to be a first time
for everything, right?

00:08:55.871 --> 00:08:58.544
Precedents are only set
to be overturned later.

00:08:59.178 --> 00:09:00.915
<i>You two are both progressive</i>
<i>thinkers,</i>

00:09:00.981 --> 00:09:02.685
<i>so you might see it that way,</i>

00:09:02.752 --> 00:09:05.056
<i>but I'm a first year student</i>
<i>in course two.</i>

00:09:05.423 --> 00:09:06.760
And on top of that,

00:09:06.827 --> 00:09:08.630
I've been standing out
in bad ways.

00:09:08.697 --> 00:09:10.668
I guess so.

00:09:10.968 --> 00:09:13.674
Trust between engineer
and user is a crucial part

00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:15.276
of CAD fine tuning.

00:09:15.644 --> 00:09:17.749
Inviting backlash
from athletes doesn't sound like

00:09:17.815 --> 00:09:19.084
a good idea to me.

00:09:19.753 --> 00:09:20.755
both: Hmm.

00:09:20.821 --> 00:09:22.124
[chair rattles]
[gasps]

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.796
[Miyuki] Since my brother
already fine tunes my CAD,

00:09:24.863 --> 00:09:25.931
I'd like him to continue

00:09:25.998 --> 00:09:27.602
for the ninth school
competition.

00:09:28.336 --> 00:09:30.006
Am I asking too much?

00:09:30.073 --> 00:09:31.242
[grunts]

00:09:31.308 --> 00:09:32.277
What a good point!

00:09:32.344 --> 00:09:33.714
Having an engineer on board

00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:36.218
who you trust provides
a lot of moral support.

00:09:36.285 --> 00:09:37.655
Yeah!

00:09:37.722 --> 00:09:39.158
Well, all right!

00:09:39.224 --> 00:09:40.995
There's going to be
a prep session after school

00:09:41.061 --> 00:09:42.431
so let's talk it all over then.

00:09:42.497 --> 00:09:43.734
[grunts]

00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:45.069
[exhales sharply]

00:09:52.117 --> 00:09:53.921
[groans]

00:09:54.021 --> 00:09:54.989
Oh!

00:09:57.895 --> 00:09:59.498
[Azusa] I see that you've
brought your Silver Horn in

00:09:59.566 --> 00:10:00.500
with you today.

00:10:00.568 --> 00:10:01.770
[Tatsuya] Yes.

00:10:01.837 --> 00:10:03.640
I recently got
this brand new holster,

00:10:03.707 --> 00:10:05.143
so I thought I'd break it in.

00:10:06.212 --> 00:10:07.515
What?
Would you mind showing me it,

00:10:07.582 --> 00:10:09.118
pretty please?

00:10:09.552 --> 00:10:11.523
[exhales]
Sure, that's fine with me.

00:10:11.923 --> 00:10:13.259
[Tatsuya] Go ahead.

00:10:13.326 --> 00:10:14.328
Wow!

00:10:14.394 --> 00:10:16.600
It's a bona fide genuine
Silver Horn model!

00:10:16.666 --> 00:10:18.971
I'm blown away by the way
it's cut.

00:10:19.037 --> 00:10:20.641
This exquisite curve
is conducive

00:10:20.708 --> 00:10:21.676
to quick drawing!

00:10:21.743 --> 00:10:23.747
Ah, practicality never gets lost

00:10:23.814 --> 00:10:25.718
in their
cutting edge technology.

00:10:25.784 --> 00:10:27.922
Oh, Lord Silver,
how I admire you.

00:10:27.989 --> 00:10:29.024
Ah.
[computer buzzing]

00:10:29.091 --> 00:10:30.493
[grunts]

00:10:31.428 --> 00:10:34.636
Wow, it's so out of the ordinary
for Miyuki to miss, isn't it?

00:10:34.702 --> 00:10:36.740
Must be a coincidence.

00:10:37.708 --> 00:10:38.811
You gotta wonder,

00:10:38.877 --> 00:10:40.881
what kind of person
is Taurus Silver?

00:10:40.948 --> 00:10:42.718
Do you find him intriguing?

00:10:42.785 --> 00:10:44.956
What?
Of course I find him intriguing.

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:48.062
I mean, like, come on.
The man's a pioneer.

00:10:48.496 --> 00:10:51.001
[Azusa] Starting with making
loop casting a reality,

00:10:51.068 --> 00:10:53.907
he's an engineering genius said
to have catapulted specialized

00:10:53.974 --> 00:10:56.913
CAD software forward into
the future by, like, a decade!

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.784
How could that not fascinate me?

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:01.422
I'm not well‐informed,
I see.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:04.461
Who knew that he
was held in such high regard?

00:11:04.529 --> 00:11:05.931
Hey, hey, Tatsuya,

00:11:05.998 --> 00:11:07.535
what kind
of person do you imagine

00:11:07.602 --> 00:11:09.004
that Taurus Silver might be?

00:11:09.071 --> 00:11:11.108
This may sound a bit strange.

00:11:11.175 --> 00:11:13.814
It's possible he's actually
a Japanese youth

00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:15.216
just like any one of us.

00:11:15.283 --> 00:11:16.820
[computer beeping]

00:11:16.887 --> 00:11:17.922
[all gasping]

00:11:17.989 --> 00:11:19.391
[Azusa] Japanese, you say?

00:11:19.458 --> 00:11:21.395
Yes, since he works at FLT,

00:11:21.462 --> 00:11:23.466
which is located in Japan.

00:11:23.534 --> 00:11:25.303
By the way, Ah‐chan,

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:26.438
[Azusa] Yes?

00:11:26.506 --> 00:11:27.642
Didn't I hear you say you had

00:11:27.708 --> 00:11:28.877
to finish
your homework assignment

00:11:28.944 --> 00:11:29.979
during our lunch break?

00:11:30.046 --> 00:11:31.917
[Azusa squeaks]
Miss Saegusa!

00:11:31.983 --> 00:11:33.219
[giggles]
If you want,

00:11:33.286 --> 00:11:34.956
I can help you out just
a little, all right?

00:11:35.023 --> 00:11:36.425
For real?
You mean it?

00:11:36.492 --> 00:11:39.131
[Mayumi] So what kind
of assignment is this, exactly?

00:11:40.834 --> 00:11:43.272
[Azusa] Actually, it's a report
on the three major puzzles

00:11:43.339 --> 00:11:46.713
of weight‐based magic,
and it's really difficult.

00:11:47.214 --> 00:11:50.888
First, a gravity control
thermonuclear fusion reactor.

00:11:50.955 --> 00:11:53.259
Second, a quasi‐perpetual
motion machine based

00:11:53.326 --> 00:11:55.396
on theories
of infinite inertial expansion.

00:11:55.463 --> 00:11:57.868
Third, why general purpose
flying spells can't

00:11:57.935 --> 00:11:58.937
be actualized,

00:11:59.004 --> 00:12:00.306
but I can't figure out how

00:12:00.373 --> 00:12:02.010
to explain that part.

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.014
To fly using magic,

00:12:04.081 --> 00:12:06.485
<i>every time you accelerate,</i>
<i>decelerate,</i>

00:12:06.553 --> 00:12:08.122
<i>ascend,</i>
<i>and descend,</i>

00:12:08.189 --> 00:12:09.926
<i>you need to layer</i>
<i>a new spell over</i>

00:12:09.993 --> 00:12:12.197
<i>the magic already</i>
<i>being executed.</i>

00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:16.372
<i>Since the necessary phenomena</i>
<i>interference magic increases</i>

00:12:16.438 --> 00:12:17.541
<i>each time,</i>

00:12:17.608 --> 00:12:19.946
<i>the most you can hope for</i>
<i>is ten layers.</i>

00:12:20.547 --> 00:12:22.752
<i>This is why flying spells</i>
<i>aren't feasible</i>

00:12:22.818 --> 00:12:23.954
<i>in the real world,</i>

00:12:24.021 --> 00:12:26.526
but if layering is necessary,

00:12:26.593 --> 00:12:28.764
couldn't you
theoretically speaking cancel

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:32.237
the ongoing spell and then cast
a new invocation in its place?

00:12:32.304 --> 00:12:35.109
But if the trick to flying
is really that easy,

00:12:35.176 --> 00:12:37.848
then somebody must
have already tried it, right?

00:12:38.182 --> 00:12:40.053
Not to mention that it's
a lot like unleashing

00:12:40.119 --> 00:12:42.490
area interference after
the fact.

00:12:42.558 --> 00:12:44.294
Looks like two years ago,

00:12:44.361 --> 00:12:46.566
they conducted an experiment
in England based

00:12:46.633 --> 00:12:48.069
on that very idea.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.373
Although it ended in failure.

00:12:50.741 --> 00:12:52.077
[Azusa] What was the reason?

00:12:52.143 --> 00:12:55.016
[Suzune] Hmm, it doesn't state
what the reason was.

00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:56.686
Oh.

00:12:57.287 --> 00:12:59.057
[Mayumi] What do you think,
Tatsuya?

00:12:59.525 --> 00:13:03.366
Unfortunately, that experiment
was fundamentally flawed.

00:13:03.432 --> 00:13:04.636
Huh?

00:13:04.702 --> 00:13:07.541
[Tatsuya] One magic sequence
can't affect another one.

00:13:08.242 --> 00:13:09.144
It's true.

00:13:09.211 --> 00:13:12.217
Even regarding
area interference,

00:13:12.283 --> 00:13:15.524
unless the spell directly
wipes out a magic sequence,

00:13:15.591 --> 00:13:17.193
even with anti magic,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.464
it still isn't an exception
to this rule.

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:21.035
[all gasping]

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:23.439
[Mayumi] In other words,

00:13:23.507 --> 00:13:26.278
using magic on another sequence
was meaningless?

00:13:26.345 --> 00:13:27.615
[Tatsuya] Yes.

00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:30.554
The British scholars
who ran that experiment

00:13:30.621 --> 00:13:34.494
must surely have misunderstood
anti‐magic's nature.

00:13:34.562 --> 00:13:36.332
[school bell rings]

00:13:36.398 --> 00:13:37.367
Oh.

00:13:38.603 --> 00:13:40.039
[screams]

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.959
[Mayumi] The student council
hereby nominates Tatsuya Shiba

00:13:50.026 --> 00:13:52.531
of class 1E to join
the engineering staff.

00:13:52.598 --> 00:13:54.034
[Boy] He's a Weed.

00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:55.436
[Boy 2] But he's on
the disciplinary committee.

00:13:55.504 --> 00:13:58.510
[Boy 3] Is he up
to fine tuning CADs, though?

00:13:59.077 --> 00:14:00.848
They've got no clue
how good Tatsuya is.

00:14:00.914 --> 00:14:02.050
Yeah.

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:03.587
Personally, I know that I prefer

00:14:03.653 --> 00:14:05.724
to have Tatsuya as my engineer.

00:14:06.358 --> 00:14:09.398
Apparently some among us
are not quite convinced.

00:14:09.999 --> 00:14:12.070
I think it's best
to have them observe

00:14:12.137 --> 00:14:13.907
Shiba's talent before
their eyes.

00:14:15.711 --> 00:14:17.982
But what are we going
to do specifically?

00:14:18.617 --> 00:14:22.490
I think we should have
him adjust an actual CAD.

00:14:22.992 --> 00:14:24.896
I'd be happy to volunteer
as the guinea pig.

00:14:24.962 --> 00:14:26.231
[Boy 4] Way too risky!

00:14:26.566 --> 00:14:27.500
If he's sub par,

00:14:27.568 --> 00:14:29.572
injury will be the least
of your problems.

00:14:29.939 --> 00:14:31.676
All right,
since I am the official

00:14:31.743 --> 00:14:33.279
who nominated Shiba,

00:14:33.345 --> 00:14:35.249
I should be the one
to take on that role.

00:14:36.118 --> 00:14:37.387
[Takeaki] I have a better idea.

00:14:38.757 --> 00:14:40.293
Please allow me
to take it on.

00:14:46.606 --> 00:14:47.440
[Tatsuya] For clarification,

00:14:47.508 --> 00:14:49.177
the task is
to copy Kirihara's

00:14:49.244 --> 00:14:51.448
CAD settings over
to this new CAD

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:52.952
for competitive use,

00:14:53.018 --> 00:14:55.356
and to make it
immediately usable.

00:14:55.924 --> 00:14:57.762
However, I'm not to tamper

00:14:57.828 --> 00:14:59.766
with the activation
sequence itself.

00:15:00.433 --> 00:15:02.237
Do I understand this correctly?

00:15:02.303 --> 00:15:04.374
Yes, that's it exactly.

00:15:06.278 --> 00:15:07.548
[Mayumi] What's wrong?

00:15:07.948 --> 00:15:10.052
I don't really recommend
duplicating all

00:15:10.119 --> 00:15:12.190
the settings of a CAD

00:15:12.257 --> 00:15:14.194
to another one
with different specs.

00:15:14.996 --> 00:15:17.033
Well, it can't be helped.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.438
[Tatsuya] Safety first it is,
then.

00:15:19.505 --> 00:15:21.008
[gasps]

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:34.936
Thank you very much.

00:15:35.002 --> 00:15:36.639
Feel free to remove it now.

00:15:42.651 --> 00:15:43.620
[exhales]

00:15:45.591 --> 00:15:46.526
Huh?

00:15:46.593 --> 00:15:48.530
What does that guy think
he's doing?

00:15:48.597 --> 00:15:50.634
[Boy] Strictly keyboard
in this day and age?

00:15:50.701 --> 00:15:51.636
How primitive.

00:15:52.638 --> 00:15:55.811
Wow, totally manual fine tuning,
huh?

00:15:56.245 --> 00:15:58.717
What's up, Kei?
Is that something amazing?

00:15:58.783 --> 00:15:59.819
Yeah.

00:15:59.886 --> 00:16:01.789
[Kei] It's just that there seem

00:16:01.856 --> 00:16:03.092
to be a whole lot of people

00:16:03.159 --> 00:16:05.363
who don't get what it is
that Shiba is doing.

00:16:07.568 --> 00:16:08.970
Process complete.

00:16:11.241 --> 00:16:12.578
[grunts]
[CAD beeping]

00:16:12.645 --> 00:16:14.949
[electronic buzzing]

00:16:19.424 --> 00:16:22.297
Kirihara,
how does that feel to you?

00:16:22.898 --> 00:16:24.367
No issues at all, actually.

00:16:24.434 --> 00:16:25.369
[gasps]

00:16:25.436 --> 00:16:26.906
[Tatsuya] It feels natural
to me.

00:16:26.973 --> 00:16:27.908
‐ [gasps]
‐ [grunts]

00:16:27.975 --> 00:16:29.311
So he does seem to possess

00:16:29.377 --> 00:16:30.981
a passable skill set.

00:16:31.348 --> 00:16:33.720
But you can't exactly say
that he's got finesse.

00:16:33.787 --> 00:16:35.489
[Boy 2] His methods
are too unorthodox.

00:16:35.557 --> 00:16:37.595
I for one strongly endorse
selecting Shiba

00:16:37.661 --> 00:16:39.297
to become an engineer.
[all gasping]

00:16:39.364 --> 00:16:41.001
[Azusa] The skills
we just saw him use

00:16:41.068 --> 00:16:42.738
are extremely advanced.

00:16:43.305 --> 00:16:45.276
Doing all that
fine tuning manually,

00:16:45.343 --> 00:16:47.480
that's something
I could never hope to do.

00:16:47.548 --> 00:16:50.152
Sure, but even though
his skills may be advanced,

00:16:50.219 --> 00:16:51.756
if the end product
is pedestrian,

00:16:51.823 --> 00:16:52.758
then there's no point.

00:16:52.825 --> 00:16:54.327
[footstep approaches]

00:16:54.394 --> 00:16:57.500
[Gyobu] Kirihara's personal
CAD model boasts higher specs

00:16:57.568 --> 00:16:59.237
than the one
for competitive use.

00:16:59.639 --> 00:17:01.776
Being able to prevent
the user from picking up

00:17:01.843 --> 00:17:03.212
on such a difference,

00:17:03.279 --> 00:17:05.483
I believe that such skills
should be rated highly.

00:17:05.851 --> 00:17:07.721
Well, I suppose you
could technically argue that.

00:17:08.857 --> 00:17:10.059
[Gyobu] Therefore,

00:17:10.126 --> 00:17:12.297
I hereby declare my full support
for adding Shiba

00:17:12.363 --> 00:17:13.633
to the engineering staff.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.436
Do you mean it, Hanzo?

00:17:16.004 --> 00:17:17.541
In the Nine Schools competition,

00:17:17.608 --> 00:17:19.579
our school's prestige
will be at stake.

00:17:20.146 --> 00:17:22.651
He's a first year
or there's no precedent.

00:17:22.718 --> 00:17:26.091
We cannot afford to dwell
on such trivial matters.

00:17:27.995 --> 00:17:29.632
I whole‐heartedly agree.

00:17:29.699 --> 00:17:32.170
You make a compelling point,
Hattori.

00:17:32.571 --> 00:17:34.709
[Katsuto] Shiba just showed us
he's more than qualified

00:17:34.775 --> 00:17:36.913
to be a member
of our school's team.

00:17:37.447 --> 00:17:40.654
I, too, support adding Shiba
to the engineering team.

00:17:41.689 --> 00:17:44.060
[phone ringing]

00:17:44.127 --> 00:17:45.597
[beeps]

00:17:45.964 --> 00:17:47.133
[Tatsuya] It's been a while.

<i>Long time no see,</i>
<i>special officer.</i>

00:17:50.039 --> 00:17:51.208
[Tatsuya] If that's
how you're going

00:17:51.275 --> 00:17:54.114
to be referring to me,
are we on a secret line?

00:17:54.982 --> 00:17:56.351
I'm amazed at how adept you are

00:17:56.418 --> 00:17:58.022
at breaking
into civilian landlines

00:17:58.088 --> 00:17:59.592
every single time.

00:18:00.459 --> 00:18:02.297
<i>It's more difficult</i>
<i>than you'd think.</i>

00:18:02.363 --> 00:18:04.535
<i>Officer,</i>
<i>I have to say,</i>

00:18:04.602 --> 00:18:07.407
I think the security around
your house is way too stringent.

00:18:07.473 --> 00:18:10.246
[Tatsuya] That's because hackers
these days are relentless.

00:18:11.649 --> 00:18:12.785
Well, Major...

00:18:13.385 --> 00:18:15.857
What's on your agenda
for our call today?

00:18:16.358 --> 00:18:18.262
<i>First off,</i>
<i>a work‐related matter.</i>

00:18:18.329 --> 00:18:20.032
‐ [Tatsuya] Right.
<i>‐ Good news.</i>

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:22.671
<i>Today we finished overhauling</i>
<i>the Third Eye.</i>

00:18:23.305 --> 00:18:24.474
<i>[Major] And at this juncture,</i>

00:18:24.542 --> 00:18:26.211
<i>we'd like you</i>
<i>to update the software,</i>

00:18:26.278 --> 00:18:28.215
<i>run some functionality tests.</i>

00:18:29.184 --> 00:18:30.286
[Tatsuya] Very well.

00:18:30.721 --> 00:18:32.156
I'll head over there
tomorrow morning.

00:18:32.223 --> 00:18:33.225
<i>Negative.</i>

00:18:33.292 --> 00:18:34.695
The time table is not so urgent

00:18:34.762 --> 00:18:36.633
<i>that you need</i>
<i>to be missing classes.</i>

00:18:36.899 --> 00:18:37.935
[Tatsuya] Actually,

00:18:38.002 --> 00:18:39.772
I'm scheduled to report
to FLT

00:18:39.839 --> 00:18:41.308
on my next day off anyway.

00:18:41.809 --> 00:18:44.047
<i>[Major] I see.</i>
<i>Then tomorrow morning,</i>

00:18:44.114 --> 00:18:45.617
<i>report to the usual place.</i>

00:18:46.018 --> 00:18:47.387
Understood, sir.

00:18:49.859 --> 00:18:51.261
<i>Next on the agenda,</i>

00:18:51.328 --> 00:18:53.332
<i>is it true that you'll</i>
<i>be taking part</i>

00:18:53.399 --> 00:18:55.804
<i>in the upcoming Nine Schools</i>
<i>competition?</i>

00:18:55.871 --> 00:18:57.641
[gasps]
Yes, sir.

00:18:58.242 --> 00:18:59.545
<i>[Major] The competition site</i>

00:18:59.612 --> 00:19:01.783
<i>is in the southeast</i>
<i>Fuji training area.</i>

00:19:02.216 --> 00:19:04.588
Of course,
it's the same every year, but...

00:19:05.156 --> 00:19:07.293
<i>Listen, Tatsuya.</i>
<i>Stay alert.</i>

00:19:08.462 --> 00:19:10.132
<i>In that same area,</i>

00:19:10.199 --> 00:19:11.936
<i>our forces have</i>
<i>repeatedly spotted what</i>

00:19:12.003 --> 00:19:13.172
<i>are most likely members</i>

00:19:13.238 --> 00:19:14.809
<i>of an international</i>
<i>crime syndicate.</i>

00:19:14.909 --> 00:19:16.278
<i>Given the timing,</i>

00:19:16.345 --> 00:19:19.050
<i>we think they're targeting</i>
<i>the Nine Schools competition.</i>

00:19:19.317 --> 00:19:20.286
[Tatsuya] You said it was

00:19:20.353 --> 00:19:22.290
an international
crime syndicate?

00:19:22.658 --> 00:19:24.762
<i>Yes, I had Mibu look into it.</i>

00:19:25.196 --> 00:19:27.200
[Tatsuya] Do you mean
the father

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:29.371
of First High's second year
Sayaka Mibu?

00:19:29.437 --> 00:19:30.974
<i>[Major] I do.</i>

00:19:31.041 --> 00:19:32.076
<i>In retirement,</i>

00:19:32.143 --> 00:19:33.412
Mibu transferred to the Cabinet

<i>Information Management Agency</i>

00:19:35.349 --> 00:19:37.755
<i>to head international</i>
<i>crime units.</i>

00:19:38.122 --> 00:19:39.491
Consider me surprised.

00:19:39.925 --> 00:19:41.529
<i>[Major] Mibu thinks they might</i>
<i>be members</i>

00:19:41.596 --> 00:19:44.869
of a Hong Kong‐based
crime syndicate infamously known

00:19:44.935 --> 00:19:46.572
<i>as the No Head Dragon.</i>

00:19:47.006 --> 00:19:48.977
<i>As soon as I learn</i>
<i>additional intel,</i>

00:19:49.044 --> 00:19:50.614
<i>I will contact you again.</i>

This is perfect timing.

00:20:03.005 --> 00:20:05.042
I was just about to ask you
to come down here.

00:20:05.109 --> 00:20:06.244
Hmm?

[door slides closed]

00:20:13.459 --> 00:20:14.829
You're correct.
It is.

What do you think of it?

00:20:18.368 --> 00:20:19.805
You look quite beautiful.

00:20:20.439 --> 00:20:22.243
It really does suit you well.

Well, congratulations!

[gasps]

00:20:39.945 --> 00:20:41.481
And once again, Brother,

00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:43.419
you made
the impossible possible.

00:20:44.053 --> 00:20:46.793
I'm incredibly proud
to be your younger sister.

00:20:46.859 --> 00:20:48.228
I'm very lucky.

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:50.667
I appreciate that, Miyuki.

[Tatsuya] On my next day off,

00:20:57.447 --> 00:20:59.451
I'll test this out at FLT,

00:20:59.518 --> 00:21:02.256
but I'd like you to take it
for a spin first, Miyuki.

Do you find
this excessive processing

No headache

Does the spell feel choppy
at all to you?

It's seamless.

00:21:48.048 --> 00:21:49.417
The time recorder function

00:21:54.695 --> 00:21:56.966
which accurately documents
the activation points

00:21:57.033 --> 00:21:58.368
of each ongoing spell.

00:21:58.903 --> 00:22:00.774
Human minds simply
aren't designed

00:22:00.841 --> 00:22:02.911

00:22:02.978 --> 00:22:06.117
so I had to supplement it using
the machine.

00:22:06.552 --> 00:22:08.623

Brother.
