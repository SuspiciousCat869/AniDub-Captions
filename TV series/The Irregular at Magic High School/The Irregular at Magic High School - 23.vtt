<i>[Chen] Well, Mr. Zhou,</i>

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:13.159
I've been notified
the home country

00:00:13.226 --> 00:00:14.763
will be sending us a warship.

00:00:15.163 --> 00:00:16.600
Thanks to your hospitality,

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:18.604
we can launch
our next operation.

00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:20.775
[Zhou] It's my honor
to have been able

00:00:20.842 --> 00:00:22.011
to assist you,
Lord Chen.

00:00:22.077 --> 00:00:23.313
Thing is,

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.816
fortune deserted us,

00:00:24.883 --> 00:00:27.488
and my second in command fell
into the enemy's hands.

00:00:28.423 --> 00:00:29.693
I'm sorry.
Truly,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.097
this can only have been
the worst of luck.

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:34.536
I thought Master Lu unbeatable.

00:00:35.237 --> 00:00:37.709
[Chen] His defeat
is a colossal disgrace.

00:00:37.776 --> 00:00:40.380
All the same,
our country needs that soldier.

00:00:44.723 --> 00:00:45.892
[grunts]

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:48.363
I wonder if you could help
us on in that regard.

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.770
Of course.
Your wish is my command,

00:00:51.837 --> 00:00:53.173
my lord.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.876
As a matter of fact,

00:00:54.943 --> 00:00:57.582
Master Lu is scheduled
to be transported tomorrow

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.487
to a foreigner's prison
which is located in Yokosuka.

00:01:00.555 --> 00:01:03.059
[Chen grunts]
That's hard to believe.

00:01:03.126 --> 00:01:04.730
[Zhou] Indeed.
It's quite opportune.

00:01:04.796 --> 00:01:06.667
The timing couldn't be better
for us.

00:01:07.936 --> 00:01:09.272
And in exchange,

00:01:09.338 --> 00:01:11.911
if you don't take offense
to me putting it that way,

00:01:11.977 --> 00:01:13.748
during tomorrow's operation,

00:01:13.814 --> 00:01:16.419

from this area?

We're also going after

00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:43.608
So some skirmishing will
unavoidably spill over here.

00:01:47.782 --> 00:01:48.851

to the convention
center tomorrow?

00:03:32.726 --> 00:03:34.596
I'm meeting the others there
at 8:00.

The competition starts

meeting up there?

[Erika] Oh, uh, it's just‐‐

00:03:50.628 --> 00:03:53.433
Tatsuya, about the guard detail
for the demo,

00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:55.437
could you let us help out
with that as well?

00:03:56.272 --> 00:03:58.143
Fine by me,
I suppose.

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.579
But I don't understand.

00:03:59.646 --> 00:04:01.884
Why would you two go through
all that trouble?

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.023
Well, of course you'd ask that.
And the answer is...

00:04:05.691 --> 00:04:07.695
After all that special training
with Erika,

00:04:07.762 --> 00:04:09.866

would be a real shame.

to train this guy's butt off

You're saying that
as though this incident

will be a one‐and‐done matter.

00:04:44.468 --> 00:04:46.472

Never mind any goodwill.

nor animosity from him.

[Suzune] Miss Chiaki,
did you know

00:06:11.944 --> 00:06:15.016
in the written exam portion
of the first semester finals,

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:18.189
Mr. Shiba scored so high
that he left everybody

00:06:18.256 --> 00:06:20.126
below second place
in the dust?

00:06:20.193 --> 00:06:21.395
In particular,

00:06:21.462 --> 00:06:23.601
he achieved an astonishing
perfect score

00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:25.403
in magical engineering.

00:06:26.873 --> 00:06:28.711
What does that have
to do with anything?

00:06:28.777 --> 00:06:31.617
[Suzune] Because the first year
who came in second was you.

00:06:32.518 --> 00:06:35.090
You scored 92 out of 100.

00:06:35.891 --> 00:06:38.096
Normally you could have made
a claim for top marks

00:06:38.162 --> 00:06:39.532
with such a high score.

00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:41.803
So what if I did?

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.277
As far as studying the field
of magic engineering goes,

00:06:45.343 --> 00:06:47.982
I truly believe you have
the potential

00:06:48.049 --> 00:06:49.184

[gasps]

00:06:50.855 --> 00:06:52.424
[Suzune] I learned a lot about

00:06:52.491 --> 00:06:54.663

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:56.600

into something productive,

00:07:05.618 --> 00:07:08.356
then I'm positive one day
you'll find

00:07:08.423 --> 00:07:09.893

00:08:57.207 --> 00:08:58.176
[Kyouko] Yes.

00:08:58.242 --> 00:08:59.211
Tomorrow they'll be holding

00:08:59.278 --> 00:09:01.248
the National High School
magic thesis competition

00:09:01.315 --> 00:09:03.687
at the Yokohama International
Convention Center.

00:09:03.754 --> 00:09:05.791
Did you not realize that?

00:09:05.858 --> 00:09:06.927
Oh.

00:09:06.993 --> 00:09:08.731
<i>[Toshikazu] I mean,</i>
<i>I am aware.</i>

00:09:08.797 --> 00:09:10.300
<i>[Kyouko] A young man</i>
<i>who I'm acquainted with</i>

00:09:10.366 --> 00:09:11.903
<i>will be taking part</i>
<i>in the contest</i>

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.741
so I'd like to go cheer him on.

00:09:13.807 --> 00:09:15.410
<i>[Toshikazu] Ah.</i>

00:09:15.878 --> 00:09:17.749
One more thing.
If possible,

00:09:17.815 --> 00:09:20.053
please ask some friends‐‐
your subordinates, maybe‐‐

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.088
to join us.

00:09:21.155 --> 00:09:22.257
Huh?

00:09:22.324 --> 00:09:23.627
[Kyouko] If you could also bring

00:09:23.694 --> 00:09:24.763
and loaded firearms,

00:09:24.829 --> 00:09:25.965
that'd be a huge help.

00:09:26.031 --> 00:09:29.037
Wh‐‐so what might
you be anticipating?

00:09:29.104 --> 00:09:30.641
Obviously...

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.549
<i>[Kyouko] I'm hoping</i>
<i>that nothing happens, but...</i>

00:09:38.156 --> 00:09:41.061
[indistinct chatter]

00:09:48.376 --> 00:09:49.579
Oh.

00:09:50.246 --> 00:09:51.248
[gasping]

00:10:01.603 --> 00:10:03.139
I knew it.

00:10:04.709 --> 00:10:07.147
Miyuki, it's been a long time,
hasn't it?

00:10:07.214 --> 00:10:08.951
That's right.
I haven't seen you since

00:10:09.017 --> 00:10:10.487
that day back in February.

00:10:10.554 --> 00:10:11.857
First Lieutenant,

00:10:11.923 --> 00:10:13.426
are you sure you should
be visiting

00:10:13.493 --> 00:10:14.696
the First High green room?

00:10:14.762 --> 00:10:16.600
Oh, it's all right.

00:10:16.666 --> 00:10:18.670
After all,
as a technical officer,

00:10:18.737 --> 00:10:20.340
it would make sense
that I'm visiting you,

00:10:20.406 --> 00:10:23.246
the student who unveiled
such dazzling skills during

00:10:23.312 --> 00:10:24.516
the NSC in the spring.

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:25.618
[chuckles]

00:10:25.684 --> 00:10:27.420
Okay, enough with
the pleasantries,

00:10:27.487 --> 00:10:28.824
special agent.

00:10:28.891 --> 00:10:31.228
The mobile suit we discussed
has been completed.

00:10:31.596 --> 00:10:33.800
[Kyouko] Lieutenant Sanada
told me to let you know

00:10:33.867 --> 00:10:35.270
they'll be delivering
it here tonight.

00:10:35.336 --> 00:10:37.575
Wow, they finished
the suit already?

00:10:37.642 --> 00:10:38.977
That's quite impressive.

00:10:39.712 --> 00:10:41.248
That isn't all, though.

00:10:41.315 --> 00:10:44.923
Sadly, that incident isn't
entirely over just yet.

00:10:44.989 --> 00:10:46.793
Is there another problem?

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.097
[Kyouko] The details
are on this card.

00:10:49.699 --> 00:10:51.335
While I've taken
some precautions myself

00:10:51.402 --> 00:10:53.272
in anticipation,

00:10:53.339 --> 00:10:56.445
You should remain alert also.
A battle may be brewing.

00:10:56.513 --> 00:10:58.249
I understand.

00:10:58.316 --> 00:11:00.921
Miyuki and I will make sure
to at least be prepared.

00:11:00.988 --> 00:11:02.859
I'll follow your lead, brother.

00:11:03.727 --> 00:11:05.263
But if we are attacked...

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:06.432
[gasps]

00:11:06.498 --> 00:11:07.635
[Kyouko] I'm counting on you.

00:11:11.475 --> 00:11:12.578
[exhales]

00:11:13.045 --> 00:11:14.248
<i>[Miyuki] Very well.</i>

00:11:14.314 --> 00:11:17.220
[indistinct chatter]

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:23.132
[gasps]

[groans]

00:11:26.472 --> 00:11:27.675
Huh?
Hey, Erika,

00:11:27.742 --> 00:11:28.677
that guy over there.

00:11:28.744 --> 00:11:29.779
‐ [gasps]
‐ Hmm?

00:11:29.846 --> 00:11:31.550
Oh, so do you know that man?

00:11:32.017 --> 00:11:34.321
[Erika] He's just some creepy
pickup artist.

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:41.937
[Masaki] Miss Shiba.

00:11:42.304 --> 00:11:43.907
[Miyuki] Oh, Mr. Ichijou.

00:11:44.308 --> 00:11:46.646
[Masaki] It's been a while.
How are you?

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.284
I haven't seen you since
that after party dance.

00:11:49.351 --> 00:11:50.521
Oh, yes.

00:11:50.588 --> 00:11:52.525
I'm so sorry I haven't been
in touch since then.

00:11:52.592 --> 00:11:54.529
Oh, no.
I should be sorry.

00:11:54.896 --> 00:11:56.533
[Miyuki] So are you patrolling
the site?

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.702
[grunts]
That's correct.

00:11:57.768 --> 00:11:59.271
I volunteered to participate

00:11:59.338 --> 00:12:01.141
in the event's
joint security detail.

00:12:01.208 --> 00:12:03.279
Oh, my.
How truly noble of you.

00:12:03.346 --> 00:12:05.316
Just knowing you're out there
really helps put

00:12:05.383 --> 00:12:06.786
my mind at ease.

00:12:06.853 --> 00:12:08.422
I'm counting on you, okay?

00:12:08.489 --> 00:12:10.694
I promise I will do everything
in my power

00:12:10.761 --> 00:12:12.798
to live up to your expectations.

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:14.769
[Miyuki] Good luck as well,
Mr. Tomitsuka.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:17.340
Y‐‐You know my name, too?

00:12:18.977 --> 00:12:20.313
Thank you very much, Miss Shiba!

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.885
It's almost time
so I must get going.

00:12:29.532 --> 00:12:31.569
I'll be looking forward
to next time.

00:12:31.636 --> 00:12:33.005

00:12:38.049 --> 00:12:40.153
the opening ceremony will begin.

<i>Staff members and contestants,</i>

00:12:43.292 --> 00:12:45.898
<i>please make your way</i>
<i>to the main hall by 9:00 a. m.</i>

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.702
[Erika] Hey, Tatsuya.

00:12:47.768 --> 00:12:49.004
Hi, Erika.

00:12:49.404 --> 00:12:50.373
Hang on.
Where's Leo?

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.643
Give me a break!

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:53.947
Would you mind not lumping me in
with that knucklehead?

00:12:54.014 --> 00:12:55.918
[Erika] All I did was bestow
some skills

00:12:55.985 --> 00:12:57.420
and weapons on the guy,
you know.

00:12:57.487 --> 00:12:58.757
You're imagining things.

00:12:58.824 --> 00:13:00.928
There is nothing between us
beyond that.

00:13:00.995 --> 00:13:03.332
I didn't intend it
to come off that way.

00:13:03.399 --> 00:13:05.370
Do you mind if I ask where
the others are?

00:13:05.436 --> 00:13:07.307
[Erika] Mizuki and Miki
are down there.

00:13:07.675 --> 00:13:09.444
They got front row seats.

00:13:10.213 --> 00:13:11.415
[chuckles]

00:13:11.482 --> 00:13:13.352
So cozy together.

00:13:24.241 --> 00:13:25.811
‐ Ah.
‐ [Kyouko] Pardon me.

00:13:25.878 --> 00:13:27.247
‐ Do you have a moment?
‐ [gasps]

00:13:27.314 --> 00:13:28.817
[Haruka] Y‐‐Yes.
Have a seat.

00:13:28.884 --> 00:13:30.019
Why, thank you.

00:13:34.294 --> 00:13:36.231
You're staring at me
so intensely.

00:13:36.298 --> 00:13:38.637
No offense but it's starting
to embarrass me.

00:13:38.704 --> 00:13:40.139
[grunts]
Sorry.

00:13:40.206 --> 00:13:41.175
No.

00:13:42.077 --> 00:13:43.045
Don't worry about it.

00:13:43.112 --> 00:13:44.582
In fact,
I'm actually honored

00:13:44.649 --> 00:13:47.387
the Miss Phantom has developed
such a keep interest in me.

00:13:47.955 --> 00:13:51.128
[Haruka] Who would have ever
guessed the Electron Sorceress

00:13:51.195 --> 00:13:52.397
had ever heard of me?

00:13:52.464 --> 00:13:55.336
I am as equally honored here
as you are.

00:13:56.673 --> 00:13:58.042
All right.

00:13:58.109 --> 00:14:00.380
Is there something you wanted
to discuss with me?

00:14:00.948 --> 00:14:02.985
[Kyouko] Come on.
I'm sure you already know.

00:14:03.052 --> 00:14:05.824
You don't need me to go
into actual detail, right?

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.029
Sorry.

00:14:08.095 --> 00:14:10.233
I'm not exactly
a prodigy like you are.

00:14:10.299 --> 00:14:12.571
I don't have such insight.

00:14:13.105 --> 00:14:15.009
My, how modest you are.

00:14:16.311 --> 00:14:17.615
It's odd.

00:14:17.681 --> 00:14:20.621
Master Kokonoe had only
the highest of praise for you.

00:14:20.687 --> 00:14:22.257
[gasping]

00:14:22.323 --> 00:14:24.194
Would you mind
if I'm straightforward

00:14:24.261 --> 00:14:25.531
with you, Miss Phantom?

00:14:25.597 --> 00:14:27.902
‐ [Haruka gasps]
‐ Oh, there's no need to worry.

00:14:27.968 --> 00:14:30.674
I fully understand you're just
being loyal to your mission.

00:14:30.741 --> 00:14:33.547
Believe me when I say
I simply recommend you and I

00:14:33.613 --> 00:14:35.818
as professional peers respect
each other's boundaries.

00:14:35.884 --> 00:14:37.153
Nothing more.

00:14:37.521 --> 00:14:38.724
To be perfectly honest,

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:40.226
I'm not sure what
you mean by that.

00:14:40.293 --> 00:14:43.132
There won't be any admonishment
coming from above.

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:45.002
But on the other hand,

00:14:45.069 --> 00:14:47.173
whoever is curious about
my friends,

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.946
that's who does indeed deserve
to be admonished.

Roger that.

I'll be on the lookout
for you personally.

00:15:47.227 --> 00:15:48.496
[Harunobu] I'm counting on you.

00:15:50.567 --> 00:15:52.437
Sekimoto and Hirakawa
were after

00:15:52.505 --> 00:15:54.876
the thesis
competition materials.

00:15:55.343 --> 00:15:58.115
And after further interrogating
Sekimoto today,

00:15:58.182 --> 00:16:00.486
we were able to determine
that he had been subjected

00:16:00.554 --> 00:16:01.756
to mind control.

to target the thesis

might take drastic measures.

00:16:08.904 --> 00:16:10.941
I was told they wanted Juumonji
in particular

00:16:11.008 --> 00:16:12.912

00:17:57.453 --> 00:17:59.992
[Suzune] The answer has already
been made clear

00:18:00.059 --> 00:18:01.663
in the previous century.

[audience gasping]

00:18:10.346 --> 00:18:13.419
First, convert the hydrogen fuel
into plasma,

00:18:13.485 --> 00:18:15.724
providing time
for a fusion reaction

00:18:15.791 --> 00:18:18.830
to generate enough heat
and then sustain that reaction.

00:18:20.701 --> 00:18:23.339
As you can see illustrated
on screen,

00:18:23.405 --> 00:18:25.443
this issue has already
been resolved

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:27.881
through release‐type magic.

00:18:27.948 --> 00:18:31.723
The other issue is bringing
the atomic nuclei in question

00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:33.459
into close contact,

00:18:33.526 --> 00:18:35.897
despite inherent
electrical repulsion.

00:18:35.964 --> 00:18:39.905
However, there's no method
to address this challenge,

00:18:39.972 --> 00:18:43.479
and we still haven't actualized
<i>a stable nuclear reaction.</i>

00:18:44.381 --> 00:18:46.051

<i>these issues stem</i>

00:18:48.389 --> 00:18:49.725

[chuckles]

00:19:22.691 --> 00:19:25.062
[Suzune] As the distance
closes between the nuclei,

00:19:25.129 --> 00:19:28.335
the electric repulsive force
increases geometrically.

00:19:36.552 --> 00:19:38.355
When same charge objects
with strong

00:19:38.422 --> 00:19:40.192
Coulomb forces draw close,

00:19:40.259 --> 00:19:42.531
repulsion increases
and therefore makes

00:19:42.598 --> 00:19:45.871
it impossible for the objects
to physically collide.

00:19:46.672 --> 00:19:47.875

It is possible to reduce
the electric repulsive force

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.530
through the use of magic.

00:19:58.963 --> 00:20:02.604

[crowd gasping]

00:20:13.025 --> 00:20:14.929
Without an impetus,

00:20:14.995 --> 00:20:18.903
any nuclear reaction will
then immediately come screeching

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:21.441
to an absolute standstill.

00:20:21.876 --> 00:20:25.049
Our gravity control‐type magic
fusion reactor

00:20:25.116 --> 00:20:26.986
actually takes advantage
of this.

00:20:28.556 --> 00:20:30.426
Once the reaction stops,

00:20:30.493 --> 00:20:33.265
it cools the gas through
a vibration‐type spell

00:20:33.332 --> 00:20:35.570
to a level that container
can withstand.

00:20:36.071 --> 00:20:37.039

It then transforms
the collected heat

00:20:40.714 --> 00:20:45.356
into both gravity‐control
and Coulomb control energy.

00:20:45.423 --> 00:20:47.427
Through gravity
control‐type magic,

00:20:47.493 --> 00:20:50.834
the pistons continue to rise due
to inertial energy.

00:20:51.301 --> 00:20:53.338
And the hydrogen gas
now cooled down

00:20:53.405 --> 00:20:56.445
to optimum levels is sent
to a heat sink tank.

00:20:57.881 --> 00:20:58.850
At this point,

with improved efficiency,

and by using release‐type magic
as a substitute,

00:21:09.605 --> 00:21:13.345
we think a gravity control‐type
magic fusion reactor
