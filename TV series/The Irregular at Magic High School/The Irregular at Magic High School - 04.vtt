00:00:02.772 --> 00:00:04.242
<i>[singing voice] Aniplex.</i>

00:00:09.118 --> 00:00:12.157
<i>[Mari] So, you didn't see how</i>
<i>the whole thing started, then?</i>

00:00:12.224 --> 00:00:13.360
<i>[Tatsuya] No.</i>

00:00:13.628 --> 00:00:16.266
All I saw was Miss Mibu
of the kendo team

00:00:16.332 --> 00:00:18.336
and Mr. Kirihara
of the kenjutsu team

00:00:18.403 --> 00:00:20.307
in a very heated argument.

00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:23.179
And is that why you decided
against intervening right

00:00:23.246 --> 00:00:24.382
from the start of it?

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.720
I thought if bruises were
the worst outcome,

00:00:26.787 --> 00:00:28.724
then they should settle
the score themselves.

00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:31.462
What did you do with Kirihara
after you subdued him?

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.133
[Tatsuya] Since he was injured,

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.070
I handed him over
to the health committee.

00:00:35.437 --> 00:00:37.542
And since he acknowledged
his own wrongdoing,

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:40.848
I made the decision that no
further measures were necessary.

00:00:41.216 --> 00:00:43.086
[exhales sharply]
That's fine, I guess.

00:00:43.153 --> 00:00:44.121
In that case,

00:00:44.188 --> 00:00:45.157
the disciplinary committee

00:00:45.224 --> 00:00:46.426
has no intention of sending

00:00:46.492 --> 00:00:48.230
this matter
to the correctional committee.

00:00:48.296 --> 00:00:50.535
Jumonji, what do you think?

00:00:52.806 --> 00:00:54.342
<i>[Tatsuya] So this</i>

00:00:56.714 --> 00:00:58.985
<i>in charge</i>
<i>of all club activities.</i>

00:00:59.051 --> 00:01:01.256
<i>Katsuto Jumonji,</i>

00:01:01.322 --> 00:01:03.894
the heir apparent
to the prestigious numbers clan

00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:06.533
<i>who bear the number ten</i>

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.671
<i>Burly chest,</i>

00:01:08.738 --> 00:01:11.944
<i>even his uniform can't hide</i>
<i>that insane muscle definition.</i>

00:01:12.011 --> 00:01:14.983
It's not just his physical body
<i>that impresses, though.</i>

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.486
<i>Every atom of his being,</i>

00:01:16.553 --> 00:01:18.423
<i>the sheer intensity</i>
<i>of his presence,</i>

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.760
<i>they're all phenomenal.</i>

00:01:22.331 --> 00:01:24.770
He's as imposing as a mountain.

00:01:25.304 --> 00:01:26.774
I appreciate
your lenient ruling,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.976
to be honest.

00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:31.650
The spell he cast
was lethally dangerous.

00:01:31.717 --> 00:01:34.790
Normally there would
be no escaping suspension.

00:01:35.223 --> 00:01:37.629
Of course, I'm sure
he's well aware of that.

00:01:38.163 --> 00:01:39.700
[Katsuto] I volunteer
to council him

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:42.204
so he learns from this mistake
of his.

00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:43.641
[Mari] I'm counting on you.

00:01:43.708 --> 00:01:45.845
That's fine but what about
the kendo team?

00:01:45.912 --> 00:01:48.951
When she took up the gauntlet,
she was equally to blame.

00:01:49.018 --> 00:01:50.187
All right, then.

00:01:50.253 --> 00:01:52.091
Let me confirm this
one more time.

00:01:52.491 --> 00:01:54.963
[Mari] Was Kirihara the only one
who used magic?

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.567
[grunts]

00:01:57.101 --> 00:01:58.236
Correct.

00:01:58.871 --> 00:02:01.209
I see.
Thank you for your hard work.

a rank B lethal spell.

No hesitation at all there,

Though sadly I'm afraid

[Erika] If I had to guess,
I'd say no,

that mean you've come up

When you try
to use two CADs at once,

<i>The sequence is reproduced</i>

I bet you'd rake in the cash.

00:07:15.538 --> 00:07:16.673
For one thing,

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.109
this technique
is still a little raw.

00:07:18.176 --> 00:07:19.679
It hasn't quite
been perfected yet.

00:07:19.746 --> 00:07:21.148
The bigger issue by far

00:07:21.215 --> 00:07:23.319
is that magic can be blocked
without antinite,

00:07:23.386 --> 00:07:24.756
so if anyone catches wind
of that,

00:07:24.823 --> 00:07:26.192
poof,
it's over.

00:07:26.258 --> 00:07:28.564
I still fail to see where's
the problem with that.

00:07:28.631 --> 00:07:30.501
Hey, dumbass!
It's a huge problem!

00:07:30.568 --> 00:07:34.041
If an easily‐acquired technique
to nullify magic spells got out,

00:07:34.108 --> 00:07:36.980
<i>the society would be shaken</i>
<i>to its foundations!</i>

00:07:38.049 --> 00:07:40.655
Antinite isn't
a realistic threat yet

00:07:40.721 --> 00:07:43.326
as there's relatively little
being produced.

00:07:43.393 --> 00:07:45.731
Until a counter technique
is found,

00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:47.602
I can't go public with any
of this.

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:49.171
That's amazing, really,

00:07:49.238 --> 00:07:51.877
to know that you've thought all
of this through so far.

00:07:51.943 --> 00:07:52.912
In my opinion,

00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:54.716
you're over‐analyzing a bit,
Brother.

00:07:54.783 --> 00:07:56.118
I mean,
after all,

00:07:56.185 --> 00:07:58.189
reading your opponents'
activation sequence

00:07:58.256 --> 00:08:01.630
during launch isn't something
that just anybody can do.

00:08:01.997 --> 00:08:05.203
[Miyuki] But I guess that's just
what makes you who you are.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.242
Are you implying that I'm
an indecisive wimp

00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:09.546
or something even worse,
perhaps?

00:08:09.612 --> 00:08:10.915
Dunno.

00:08:10.981 --> 00:08:13.252
I want to hear
what Erika thinks.

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:15.156
Oh, who's to say?
As for me,

00:08:15.223 --> 00:08:17.528
I might wanna ask
for Mizuki's opinion.

00:08:17.595 --> 00:08:18.597
Huh?

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:20.200
Well, I think that I, um‐‐

was over.

That was so rude,

making you wait around all
that time just for me.

00:09:44.435 --> 00:09:46.005

the same as you.

00:10:02.705 --> 00:10:04.341
Thanks for the other day.

00:10:04.776 --> 00:10:06.680
I owe you the proper gratitude.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.019
Do you think that you could
hang out with me right now?

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:12.992
Not at the moment.
I'm sorry.

What?

[Sayaka] Okay, then.

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:21.676
I'll be waiting
for you at the cafe.

00:10:26.653 --> 00:10:29.158
[Tatsuya] All right.
I'll be reading in the library.

Aren't you going
to meet Miss Mibu?

[Tatsuya] Miyuki?

00:10:36.005 --> 00:10:38.109
We're not going to talk
for hours and hours, you know.

00:10:38.176 --> 00:10:40.981
I bet she'll just ask me
to join the kendo team.

00:10:41.783 --> 00:10:44.522
I don't know.
Do you really think that's all?

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:48.095
Because I have a feeling that
it might be something else.

00:10:48.162 --> 00:10:50.534
Not for any particular reason.

00:10:50.601 --> 00:10:52.237
It just makes me uneasy.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:53.540
Although, don't get me wrong.

00:10:53.607 --> 00:10:56.713
I'm overjoyed that you've gained
such renown so fast.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.786
But if they get even an inkling
of your true powers

00:10:59.853 --> 00:11:01.923
people will swarm you
and suck you dry,

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:04.662
with only their own
selfish interest in mind.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.635
So just please be careful.

00:11:09.973 --> 00:11:11.543
[Tatsuya] Stop worrying.

00:11:11.977 --> 00:11:13.814
Whatever happens,
I'll be fine.

00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:15.049
Don't you see?

[exhales]

00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:19.692
I'll be fine.

I won't get reckless
no matter what.

00:11:22.532 --> 00:11:24.201
Make that a promise, Brother.

00:11:24.268 --> 00:11:25.303
Don't break it.

00:11:26.005 --> 00:11:27.007
I swear.

[distant birds chirping]

00:11:30.981 --> 00:11:31.950
[Tatsuya] Sorry for the wait.

00:11:32.017 --> 00:11:33.820
[Sayaka] Oh.
Hey, Shiba.

00:11:37.294 --> 00:11:39.431
So, uh, once again,

00:11:39.498 --> 00:11:41.736
thank you very much
for what you did last week.

00:11:41.803 --> 00:11:43.740
Just doing my job.
No more, no less.

00:11:43.807 --> 00:11:45.376
Mm‐mm.

00:11:45.945 --> 00:11:48.382
It was only resolved peacefully
because you diffused

00:11:48.449 --> 00:11:50.353
the brawl without
injuring anyone, Shiba.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.825
You don't have to be so modest.
[giggles]

00:11:52.892 --> 00:11:55.564
Although I admit,
I did sorta hurt Kirihara.

00:11:55.998 --> 00:11:57.735
But, come on.
The truth is,

00:11:57.802 --> 00:11:59.404
he and I crossed swords
fully prepared

00:11:59.471 --> 00:12:00.841
to sustain injury.

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:03.780
And yet so many people
wanna make a mountain out

00:12:03.847 --> 00:12:05.049

00:12:05.116 --> 00:12:07.020
disciplinary committee officers,

00:12:07.087 --> 00:12:09.324
so they can score points
for themselves.

00:12:10.226 --> 00:12:12.598
[Tatsuya] Well, I'm a member
of that committee myself,

00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:13.967
so, I, uh‐‐

00:12:14.034 --> 00:12:15.236
[Sayaka] S‐‐Sorry,
I didn't mean it that way.

00:12:15.303 --> 00:12:16.740
I swear!
Please don't be mad!

00:12:16.806 --> 00:12:18.644
Obviously, sure,
I can't stand those people,

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.413
but‐‐wait, what?

00:12:23.085 --> 00:12:25.423
Hang on.
Are you teasing me right now?

00:12:28.062 --> 00:12:30.701
[Tatsuya] So tell me.
What did you wanna talk about?

00:12:31.201 --> 00:12:33.339
Okay, I'll be as blunt as I can.

00:12:33.807 --> 00:12:36.278
Shiba, will you join
the kendo team?

00:12:36.345 --> 00:12:39.151
I appreciate the offer,
but I must decline.

00:12:39.752 --> 00:12:41.690
[Sayaka] Do you mind
if I ask why?

00:12:41.756 --> 00:12:43.092
Actually,
if you don't mind,

00:12:43.159 --> 00:12:45.163
I'd like to hear
the reason you're drafting me.

00:12:46.198 --> 00:12:47.334
Hmm.

00:12:47.735 --> 00:12:48.971
[Sayaka]
At Magic High School,

00:12:49.037 --> 00:12:51.475
magic grades are given
precedence over all.

00:12:52.043 --> 00:12:54.582
But don't you think it's wrong
to be complete defined

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:55.985
by magic alone?

00:12:56.753 --> 00:12:58.122
Yes, I'm listening.

00:12:59.424 --> 00:13:00.293
[Sayaka] As you know,

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.863
course two students
can't receive

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:03.432
practical skills training,

00:13:03.499 --> 00:13:06.005
but that discrimination we have
to live with

00:13:06.071 --> 00:13:08.442
because that's only a matter
of us lacking talent.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:09.746
[exhales]

00:13:10.113 --> 00:13:13.553
I hate that they hold my sword
in contempt simply because

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.658
I'm not adequate at magic yet.

00:13:15.724 --> 00:13:17.895
Being ignored is unbearable.

00:13:18.462 --> 00:13:21.503
I won't let them deny everything
I have to offer!

00:13:22.772 --> 00:13:24.274
Uh, Miss Mibu?

00:13:24.341 --> 00:13:25.410
[Sayaka stammers]

00:13:25.476 --> 00:13:26.546
That's why we‐‐

00:13:26.613 --> 00:13:28.349
the non‐magic oriented clubs‐‐

00:13:28.416 --> 00:13:29.886
have decided to unite.

00:13:30.453 --> 00:13:32.424
This year we're forming
a party separate

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.428
from the extracurricular
activities federation

00:13:34.494 --> 00:13:36.833
and presenting our argument
to the school:

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.438
that magic isn't everything
to us.

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:40.741
So to that end,

00:13:40.808 --> 00:13:42.310
we'd like your cooperation,
Shiba.

00:13:43.747 --> 00:13:45.049
Oh, I see.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:46.586
Are you mocking me?

00:13:47.053 --> 00:13:48.690
Not at all.
Quite the opposite.

00:13:49.324 --> 00:13:51.763
I'm just laughing
at how off‐base I was.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:52.798
[Tatsuya] You see,

00:13:52.865 --> 00:13:54.034
I thought that you were just

00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:55.370
a beautiful kendo girl.

00:13:56.038 --> 00:13:57.675
But clearly I was wrong.

00:13:57.875 --> 00:13:59.111
Beautiful?

00:13:59.177 --> 00:14:00.647
[Tatsuya] Miss Mibu.

00:14:00.714 --> 00:14:02.551
Yes, uh, what‐‐what is it?

00:14:03.352 --> 00:14:05.256
You said you're presenting
your argument.

00:14:05.323 --> 00:14:07.027
What are you going
to do after that?

00:14:07.828 --> 00:14:09.064
Huh?

<i>[Mari] Tatsuya.</i>

00:14:18.517 --> 00:14:20.219
Is it true that
you verbally abused

00:14:20.286 --> 00:14:22.257
the second year Mibu
in the cafe yesterday?

00:14:22.323 --> 00:14:23.492
[gasps]

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.931
Since you are such
a refined young lady yourself,

00:14:25.998 --> 00:14:27.802
I confess I find
it rather surprising

00:14:27.868 --> 00:14:29.071
for you to toss around vulgar,

00:14:29.137 --> 00:14:30.908
dramatic phrases
like verbal abuse.

00:14:30.974 --> 00:14:32.978
[laughs]
Well, thank you.

00:14:33.045 --> 00:14:34.114
And just so you know,

00:14:34.181 --> 00:14:35.383
you're the only one
who treats me

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.521
like a refined young lady,
Tatsuya.

00:14:37.888 --> 00:14:39.291
[Tatsuya] Is that right?

00:14:39.357 --> 00:14:42.197
Well, if he's not treating
his own girlfriend that way,

00:14:42.263 --> 00:14:44.034
then apparently your boyfriend
couldn't be much

00:14:44.101 --> 00:14:45.269
of a gentleman,
could he?

00:14:45.336 --> 00:14:47.808
No, that isn't true!
He's...

00:14:47.875 --> 00:14:49.144
[whimpers]

00:14:49.579 --> 00:14:50.848
[groans]
That's it?

00:14:50.914 --> 00:14:52.217
You've got nothing to say?

00:14:52.651 --> 00:14:55.256
Is there anything in particular
I should say about it?

00:14:55.323 --> 00:14:56.526
[giggles]

00:14:56.593 --> 00:14:57.661
[Mari groans]

00:14:58.797 --> 00:15:00.199
So, anyway,

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:02.671
about you verbally abusing Mibu
of the kendo team.

00:15:02.738 --> 00:15:03.774
Is it true or not?

00:15:04.141 --> 00:15:05.209
[exhales]
No,

00:15:05.276 --> 00:15:06.713
it's not even true
in the slightest.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:08.115
[Mari] Really?

00:15:08.182 --> 00:15:10.420
I have multiple witnesses
who observed Mibu blushing

00:15:10.486 --> 00:15:12.725
beet red and looking
very embarrassed.

00:15:13.225 --> 00:15:15.430
[high‐pitched humming]

00:15:15.496 --> 00:15:16.465
[grunts]

00:15:18.135 --> 00:15:19.872
Tell me, brother.

00:15:20.306 --> 00:15:22.678
What in the world
were you actually doing?

00:15:22.745 --> 00:15:24.715
Is that magic?

00:15:25.149 --> 00:15:26.820
Your interference power must be

00:15:26.886 --> 00:15:29.090
far more potent than most,
Miyuki.

00:15:29.157 --> 00:15:31.963
Calm down, Miyuki.
I'll explain it all.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.299
[gasps]

00:15:34.067 --> 00:15:35.303
Forgive me.

00:15:35.804 --> 00:15:37.575
[chuckles]

00:15:38.142 --> 00:15:40.614
[Tatsuya] Now,
as for the Miss Mibu incident,

00:15:40.681 --> 00:15:42.918
it seems the disciplinary
committee's activities

00:15:42.985 --> 00:15:44.822
have earned
the students' animosity.

00:15:44.889 --> 00:15:46.559
Can you elaborate a bit?

00:15:47.828 --> 00:15:48.930
[Tatsuya] Actually...

00:15:54.074 --> 00:15:56.613
[Mari] Trying to score points,
huh?

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.884
Mibu's mistaken about that.

00:15:59.184 --> 00:16:01.488
The disciplinary committee
is just an honorary post

00:16:01.556 --> 00:16:03.860
and it's not subject
to evaluation.

00:16:03.927 --> 00:16:06.298
However,
it's also an undisputed fact

00:16:06.365 --> 00:16:07.433
that this committee wields

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.437
considerable power within
the school.

00:16:09.505 --> 00:16:12.912
Some will construe your actions
as exploiting your authority.

00:16:12.978 --> 00:16:14.414
Not only that,

00:16:14.481 --> 00:16:16.853
but you should be aware there
is someone manipulating

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.155
that impression as well.

00:16:19.457 --> 00:16:21.461
[Tatsuya] Do you know
that person's identity?

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:23.132
Huh?
No, no.

00:16:23.199 --> 00:16:24.467
It's just a rumor.

00:16:24.836 --> 00:16:26.171
If we knew who it was,

00:16:26.238 --> 00:16:27.675
we'd have stomped him already.

00:16:27.741 --> 00:16:29.444
That's not what I mean.

00:16:30.012 --> 00:16:31.481
I'm talking about
the people behind

00:16:31.549 --> 00:16:33.252
whoever's doing
the manipulation.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.256
So, um, Brother‐‐

00:16:35.323 --> 00:16:36.593
[Tatsuya] For example,

00:16:36.659 --> 00:16:39.097
the Dark Anti‐Magic
political movement,

00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:40.366
a.k.a. Blanche.

00:16:40.433 --> 00:16:41.368
Say what?

00:16:41.435 --> 00:16:42.705
How could you possibly
know that?

00:16:42.771 --> 00:16:44.842
That's highly
classified information.

00:16:45.511 --> 00:16:48.315
It would be impossible
to keep all rumor sources quiet.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:50.119
On the contrary,

00:16:50.186 --> 00:16:52.123
I think full disclosure is best.

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:54.227
The government's handling
of this matter

00:16:54.294 --> 00:16:56.131
has been pathetic.

00:16:56.699 --> 00:16:57.701
[Mayumi] I agree.

00:16:57.768 --> 00:16:59.304
Despite the fact that there's

00:16:59.371 --> 00:17:02.443
an international
organization hostile to magic,

00:17:02.511 --> 00:17:05.416
they cover it up
and refuse to confront them.

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:07.621
[Tatsuya] That can't be helped
in your delicate position.

00:17:07.688 --> 00:17:08.623
What?

00:17:09.625 --> 00:17:11.094
This is a national body.

00:17:11.696 --> 00:17:14.200
And the country's doing all
the restricting and hiding.

00:17:15.102 --> 00:17:16.171
[exhales]
Is that your way

00:17:16.238 --> 00:17:17.708
of trying to console me?

00:17:18.142 --> 00:17:19.645
B‐‐But, um, chairwoman,

00:17:19.712 --> 00:17:21.916
it was Shiba who drove you right
to the brink.

00:17:21.983 --> 00:17:23.285
To drive someone to the brink

00:17:23.352 --> 00:17:24.454
and then follow through
on your own,

00:17:24.522 --> 00:17:26.325
you're quite
the brilliant player.

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:29.231
It looks like you've got Mayumi
wrapped around your finger.

00:17:29.297 --> 00:17:32.270
Uh, M‐‐Mari,
don't say things like that!

00:17:32.337 --> 00:17:34.040
[high‐pitched humming]
[grunts]

00:17:35.777 --> 00:17:38.115
Player?
A brilliant one?

00:17:38.182 --> 00:17:39.619
[Tatsuya] Just settle down,
Miyuki.

00:17:39.685 --> 00:17:41.589
They're just joking.
I promise.

00:17:43.125 --> 00:17:45.263
Let's focus, Tatsuya.
I'm curious.

00:17:45.329 --> 00:17:47.233
How are you planning
to deal with Mibu now?

00:17:47.835 --> 00:17:49.739
I'm the one who's waiting
for her answer.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.578
So I'll decide after hearing it.

00:17:53.445 --> 00:17:54.180
I see.

00:17:54.247 --> 00:17:55.416
Well, good luck.

00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:57.888
Fine, then,
but at this point in time,

00:17:57.955 --> 00:18:00.794
I have no clue what it is
you're wishing me good luck for.

00:18:00.861 --> 00:18:02.965
Whatever you manage
will be all right.

00:18:03.465 --> 00:18:05.971
You either have high hopes
for me or none at all.

00:18:06.038 --> 00:18:07.440
Rather contradictory.

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:10.479
[Tatsuya] I'll do whatever
I can manage.

00:18:14.722 --> 00:18:15.724
[knocking]

00:18:16.893 --> 00:18:17.861
Come in.

00:18:19.097 --> 00:18:20.499
[Tatsuya] Thank you.

00:18:20.567 --> 00:18:23.172
[Haruka] Sorry to call you in
on such short notice.

00:18:23.573 --> 00:18:26.512
So, are you getting used
to high school life now?

00:18:26.579 --> 00:18:27.681
[Tatsuya] No.

00:18:27.748 --> 00:18:30.052
There's so many
unexpected events popping up,

00:18:30.119 --> 00:18:31.421
I haven't been able
to hit the books.

00:18:31.488 --> 00:18:32.423
[giggles]

00:18:34.829 --> 00:18:36.365
Is everything all right?

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.637
[Tatsuya] According
to the modern day dress code‐‐

00:18:38.703 --> 00:18:39.772
Hmm?

00:18:39.839 --> 00:18:40.974
[Tatsuya] I feel the outfit
you're wearing

00:18:41.041 --> 00:18:42.477
is much too provocative,
Miss Ono.

00:18:42.544 --> 00:18:44.882
Ah?
Oh, so sorry.

00:18:45.116 --> 00:18:46.418
Now then,

00:18:46.485 --> 00:18:48.723
what's the reason I've
been summoned here today?

00:18:49.391 --> 00:18:50.761
[clears throat]

00:18:50.827 --> 00:18:53.566
I asked you to come here
to request your participation

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:56.204
in the work that we're doing.
It's very intriguing.

00:18:56.405 --> 00:18:57.875
At this school,

00:18:57.941 --> 00:19:00.847
in order to grasp the students'
psychological leanings,

00:19:00.914 --> 00:19:04.254
we have 10% of the first years
receive ongoing counseling

00:19:04.321 --> 00:19:06.224
and so far it's going very well.

00:19:06.291 --> 00:19:07.561
[Tatsuya] In other words,

00:19:07.628 --> 00:19:09.899
you're telling me I'm basically
a guinea pig.

00:19:09.965 --> 00:19:12.403
If that's all there is to it,
I'll be glad to help,

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:14.140
but what's your real motivation?

00:19:14.207 --> 00:19:15.409
My goodness!

00:19:15.476 --> 00:19:17.146
I don't have
any malicious intent.

00:19:17.213 --> 00:19:18.148
[Tatsuya] Regardless,

00:19:18.215 --> 00:19:19.417
I do believe I'm too unique

00:19:19.484 --> 00:19:21.188
to be used as a test sample.

00:19:21.254 --> 00:19:23.660
And that's why I want your
help especially.

00:19:23.727 --> 00:19:24.829
[chuckles]

00:19:24.895 --> 00:19:27.233
Fine, then I'll say
we leave it at that.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.739
[giggles]
Well, great.

00:19:29.805 --> 00:19:30.907
[Haruka] Would you mind
if I asked you

00:19:30.974 --> 00:19:32.176
a few quick questions?

00:19:32.243 --> 00:19:33.445
[Tatsuya] Go right ahead.

00:19:39.057 --> 00:19:41.194
[Haruka] That's all.
I've gotten what I needed.

00:19:41.261 --> 00:19:42.263
Thank you.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:44.167
Very good.
Please excuse me.

00:19:45.302 --> 00:19:46.706
Oh, by the way,

00:19:46.773 --> 00:19:49.444
this has no direct bearing
on your counseling, but...

00:19:50.079 --> 00:19:51.415
What is it?

00:19:51.883 --> 00:19:54.588
Is it true that Sayaka Mibu‐‐
a second year‐‐

00:19:54.655 --> 00:19:56.191
has asked you out on a date?

00:19:56.893 --> 00:19:58.228
[exhales]

00:19:58.663 --> 00:19:59.999
[Tatsuya] Where exactly
did you hear

00:20:00.066 --> 00:20:01.836
such ridiculous idle gossip?

00:20:02.336 --> 00:20:03.673
[Haruka] So it's not true?

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:06.244
[Tatsuya] Correct.
Does that inconvenience you?

00:20:06.311 --> 00:20:08.717
No, no.
it's nothing but,

00:20:08.783 --> 00:20:09.885
well, honestly,

00:20:09.952 --> 00:20:12.791
I was hoping to ask you
to do something for me

00:20:12.858 --> 00:20:15.329
if it was your intention
to date her.

00:20:15.396 --> 00:20:17.868
I did just say it was
a baseless rumor.

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:21.609
But I'd like to know.
Where did you hear about it?

00:20:21.976 --> 00:20:24.782
I'm terribly sorry.
That's classified.

00:20:25.584 --> 00:20:27.988
[Tatsuya] All right, then.
I'll be leaving now.

00:20:29.892 --> 00:20:32.430
If Miss Mibu ever causes you
any trouble,

00:20:32.497 --> 00:20:33.933
you can always come to me.

00:20:39.344 --> 00:20:40.847
[Sayaka] Just because I'm
a course two student,

00:20:40.914 --> 00:20:43.686
people shouldn't reject
my non‐magical aspects.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.694
I mean,
my sword shouldn't be...

00:20:48.061 --> 00:20:49.732
Mibu, that sentiment is shared

00:20:49.799 --> 00:20:51.836
by every other
course two student.

00:20:53.773 --> 00:20:56.546
We need his power no matter what
we have to do to get it.

00:21:01.488 --> 00:21:03.459
<i>[Miyuki] Is it all right</i>
<i>if I watch, too?</i>

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:07.901
Since it seems like something
you shouldn't miss or ignore,

00:21:07.968 --> 00:21:10.674
I thought it would be better
to share this information.

00:21:11.241 --> 00:21:12.544
[remote beeps]

00:21:13.045 --> 00:21:15.817
Cabinet name, open.
Blanche.

00:21:16.519 --> 00:21:18.021
The political crusade?

00:21:18.088 --> 00:21:20.961
All about anti‐magic,
whose name just came up today?

00:21:21.762 --> 00:21:22.831
The very same,

00:21:22.898 --> 00:21:25.035
though they claim
to be a grassroots movement.

00:21:25.469 --> 00:21:27.406
But they're actually terrorists,

00:21:27.473 --> 00:21:28.877
and there seems
to be no question

00:21:28.943 --> 00:21:30.312
that these guys
are working behind

00:21:30.379 --> 00:21:31.649
the scenes at our school.

00:21:32.784 --> 00:21:34.755
In fact,
doing my council rounds,

00:21:34.822 --> 00:21:38.395
I spotted a student who seemed
to be working with Egalite.

00:21:40.166 --> 00:21:41.803
You mean a Magic High student?

00:21:41.869 --> 00:21:45.109
Someone we go to school with
is doing this?

00:21:45.376 --> 00:21:46.512
Ironically...

00:21:47.046 --> 00:21:50.419
While they loudly advocate
anti‐magic policies,

00:21:50.486 --> 00:21:52.958
the reality is they don't
reject magic at all.

00:21:54.695 --> 00:21:56.231
[Tatsuya] Look at their slogan.

00:21:56.298 --> 00:21:58.168
"Eradication
of social discrimination

00:21:58.235 --> 00:21:59.370
by magic."

00:21:59.437 --> 00:22:01.274
How do they define
discrimination?

00:22:01.976 --> 00:22:04.515
Maybe it's the idea
that someone's true abilities

00:22:04.582 --> 00:22:06.886
and efforts aren't reflected
by their social status?

00:22:06.953 --> 00:22:08.222
Something like that.

00:22:08.656 --> 00:22:10.894
What Blanche sees
as discrimination

00:22:10.961 --> 00:22:12.865
is the income disparity.

00:22:13.566 --> 00:22:15.169
[Tatsuya] But the reason
magicians median income

00:22:15.236 --> 00:22:17.574
is so high is because
the high income bracket

00:22:17.641 --> 00:22:18.877
includes people with skills

00:22:18.943 --> 00:22:21.214
that society deems
indispensable.

00:22:21.749 --> 00:22:23.720
And the people who can't
use magic,

00:22:23.786 --> 00:22:24.955
don't they understand the use

00:22:25.022 --> 00:22:26.726
of those skills
requires training,

00:22:26.792 --> 00:22:29.163
long years of study,
patience, and stumbling,

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.569
and not just basic ability
or luck?

00:22:32.804 --> 00:22:35.342
Well, yes.
They do know that.

00:22:35.644 --> 00:22:37.079
[Tatsuya] But they won't
admit it.

00:22:37.146 --> 00:22:39.852
They keep their mouths shut
about anything inconvenient

00:22:39.919 --> 00:22:42.356
and they deceive others
as well as themselves

00:22:42.423 --> 00:22:44.260
with their sugar‐coated notions.

00:22:44.494 --> 00:22:46.264
Equality, for instance.

00:22:46.331 --> 00:22:49.170
Then those Magic High
students working with Egalite,

00:22:49.237 --> 00:22:51.007
is that also because of the...

00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:54.982
<i>[Tatsuya] They have no desire</i>
<i>to forsake magic,</i>

00:22:55.049 --> 00:22:58.121
but they can't stand the thought
<i>of appearing illegitimate.</i>

00:22:58.923 --> 00:23:01.161
<i>They ignore the effort</i>
<i>of magicians working</i>

00:23:01.228 --> 00:23:02.463
<i>on the front lines...</i>

00:23:03.131 --> 00:23:06.204
And reject any judgments
that are based on magical skill

00:23:06.271 --> 00:23:07.841
<i>as discrimination.</i>

00:23:07.908 --> 00:23:09.244
I mean,

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:12.618
it's not that I don't understand
that kind of weakness myself.

00:23:12.684 --> 00:23:15.657
I admit that deep down
I share that very sentiment.

00:23:15.724 --> 00:23:17.226
No, that's not true!

00:23:17.293 --> 00:23:18.730
Oh, Brother,

00:23:18.796 --> 00:23:21.234
you have a talent that no one
can ever match.

00:23:21.301 --> 00:23:22.671
It's just that your abilities

00:23:22.738 --> 00:23:24.274
are different
than everyone else's

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.612
and that you've put
in more effort than anyone,

00:23:26.679 --> 00:23:28.048
and that is undeniable!

00:23:29.017 --> 00:23:30.185
Yeah, right.

00:23:30.252 --> 00:23:31.689
Because I've got...

00:23:32.323 --> 00:23:34.662
That kind of talent that no one
can ever match,

00:23:34.728 --> 00:23:35.864
just like you said.

00:23:36.532 --> 00:23:37.668
[gasps]

00:23:39.037 --> 00:23:40.974
[Tatsuya] And if that
weren't the case,

00:23:41.041 --> 00:23:43.412
I might cling
to this beautiful ideal notion

00:23:43.478 --> 00:23:45.282
called equality myself.

00:23:46.017 --> 00:23:47.888
Even knowing full well
it's a lie.

00:23:47.955 --> 00:23:49.123
[grunts]

00:23:49.625 --> 00:23:51.361
[Tastuya] Those unable
to use magic...

00:23:51.929 --> 00:23:53.933
Those with inferior
magic skills...

00:23:54.067 --> 00:23:55.135
All right,

00:23:55.202 --> 00:23:57.139
then these instigators
who know everything...

00:23:57.608 --> 00:23:59.310
What agenda are they hiding?

00:24:00.045 --> 00:24:02.684
Behind them
is a hidden force that's driven

00:24:02.751 --> 00:24:05.122
to turn this country into
a nation where magic

00:24:05.189 --> 00:24:06.358
has completely died out.

00:24:06.424 --> 00:24:07.728
[gasps]

00:24:07.794 --> 00:24:09.497
Are you saying that
the anti‐magic faction

00:24:09.565 --> 00:24:12.203
is actually trying to undermine
this country's power, then?

00:24:12.269 --> 00:24:13.773
Probably, yes.

00:24:14.273 --> 00:24:16.512
That's why they find
terrorism acceptable.

00:24:17.113 --> 00:24:18.716
So if this country
ends up drained

00:24:18.783 --> 00:24:21.221
of its power,
who stands to profit?

00:24:22.758 --> 00:24:25.630
[Miyuki] That would mean
a shadow group is behind them.

00:24:26.364 --> 00:24:27.634
[Tatsuya] Apparently so.

00:24:28.101 --> 00:24:30.907
I can't just stand by,
but I don't want you to worry.

00:24:31.274 --> 00:24:32.644
<i>But still.</i>

00:24:32.711 --> 00:24:34.648
<i>There's no way that</i>
<i>the Ten Master Clans</i>

00:24:34.715 --> 00:24:36.117
will ignore them.

00:24:36.184 --> 00:24:37.821
Especially the Yotsuba clan.

00:24:39.157 --> 00:24:40.225
[Miyuki] Yotsuba.

00:24:41.595 --> 00:24:44.467
If our aunt were to intervene,
then we'd...

00:24:44.968 --> 00:24:47.641
We'd have to go back
to carrying that name!

00:24:48.141 --> 00:24:49.678
[Tatsuya] We don't have
to be afraid.

00:24:50.112 --> 00:24:53.051
If push comes to shove,
I'll take care of it.

00:24:53.853 --> 00:24:55.022
Thank you, Brother.

00:24:57.326 --> 00:24:58.696
[Tatsuya] So, then.

00:24:58.763 --> 00:25:00.232
Are you enjoying high school?

00:25:01.234 --> 00:25:02.436
<i>[Miyuki] Yes.</i>

00:25:03.271 --> 00:25:05.677
<i>[Tatsuya] I think you found</i>
<i>a couple of truly good friends</i>

00:25:05.744 --> 00:25:07.246
<i>in Erika and Mizuki.</i>

00:25:09.417 --> 00:25:10.920
Whoever they might be,

00:25:10.987 --> 00:25:13.025
I will not let any of them try

00:25:13.091 --> 00:25:15.029
to destroy this life
we have together.
