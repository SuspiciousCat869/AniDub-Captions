Oh, it's you, Tatsuya.

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:17.936
What brings you up here?

00:00:18.604 --> 00:00:21.242
I'm getting some materials
for the thesis competition.

00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:22.779
[Mayumi] Oh, really?

00:00:22.846 --> 00:00:23.681
Yeah, now that you mention it,

00:00:23.748 --> 00:00:25.250
I remember hearing you
were chosen

00:00:25.317 --> 00:00:26.554
to help out Rin‐chan.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.891
We might prove to be a nuisance
for other people

00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.394
if we stand here chatting.

00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:31.997
Shall we take this inside?

00:00:32.064 --> 00:00:33.501
Um, certainly.

00:00:39.813 --> 00:00:41.482

00:00:44.188 --> 00:00:45.758

00:00:46.527 --> 00:00:48.063
Yeah, sure thing.

00:00:48.564 --> 00:00:52.238
So does Miss Ichihara have
some kinda special motivation

00:00:52.304 --> 00:00:53.574
to pursue this topic?

00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:55.712
To raise magicians'
social standing.

00:00:55.778 --> 00:00:57.782
[Mayumi] The hope
is to transform magic

00:00:57.849 --> 00:01:00.521
into an indispensable
economic resource.

00:01:00.588 --> 00:01:02.692
Thus magicians will finally
be released

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:05.130
from their current fate
of becoming weaponized humans.

00:01:05.197 --> 00:01:08.571
The gravity control‐type magic
thermonuclear fusion reactor

00:01:08.638 --> 00:01:10.508
will go a long way
towards that goal.

00:01:10.575 --> 00:01:13.146
Well, at least that's
what Rin‐chan tells me.

00:01:13.213 --> 00:01:15.317
Now by writing
the series thesis with you,

00:01:15.384 --> 00:01:17.221
she'll be taking
her first concrete step.

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:18.991
I'm astounded.

00:01:19.058 --> 00:01:21.830
Now, who would have guessed
Miss Ichihara and I shared

00:01:21.897 --> 00:01:22.933
the same thought?

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:24.836
Seriously?
You, too, Tatsuya?

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.374
Our opinion on the matter
is rather unique.

00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:29.980
There simply aren't many
other people who think this way.

00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:32.786
[Mayumi] Hmm.
Well, good for you.

00:01:32.852 --> 00:01:34.723
I'm so glad you found chemistry
with her.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.798
No, I don't believe it's truly
a matter of us finding chemistry

00:01:38.864 --> 00:01:40.233
with each other or not.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.071
For one thing,
Miss Ichihara

00:01:42.137 --> 00:01:44.408
has a very different methodology
than I do.

00:01:44.475 --> 00:01:47.047
But you share
the same basic concept, correct?

00:01:47.114 --> 00:01:48.350
Be honest, Tatsuya.

00:01:48.416 --> 00:01:50.955
Is somebody like Rin‐chan
actually your type?

00:01:51.022 --> 00:01:52.391
Huh?

00:01:52.458 --> 00:01:54.161
[Mayumi] Here you are having
a conversation

00:01:54.228 --> 00:01:56.499
in close proximity
with a beautiful girl

00:01:56.567 --> 00:01:58.838
but you show no signs
of making a move.

00:01:59.472 --> 00:02:02.411
I'm sorry that I don't have
a more womanly figure!

00:02:03.547 --> 00:02:05.985
Frankly,
I'm not into exhibitionism.

00:02:06.553 --> 00:02:07.989
I would never touch
a woman in front

00:02:08.056 --> 00:02:09.526

00:02:10.293 --> 00:02:11.697
Huh?
Oh.

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:15.037
Uh, well, then how about
if there were no cameras

00:02:15.103 --> 00:02:16.172
or people watching us?

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.274
Of course.

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:09.953

Yes, but what could
the hackers have been after?

00:05:28.022 --> 00:05:31.597
A look at their digital commands
tells me that they

00:05:31.663 --> 00:05:33.233
were going
after documents pertaining

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:34.669
to magic theory.

00:05:34.736 --> 00:05:36.372
Considering the timing,

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:38.878
it's likely related
to the competition.

Who would ever do such a thing?

Business.

00:06:02.926 --> 00:06:05.397
We should discuss the security

What?

00:06:06.967 --> 00:06:08.571
Is the disciplinary

00:06:08.637 --> 00:06:10.140

00:06:10.207 --> 00:06:13.346
Yes we are but I'm not talking
about security for the venue.

00:06:13.413 --> 00:06:16.553
The Magic Association will
hire professionals for that.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.956

There is valuable
school equipment

00:06:25.003 --> 00:06:28.343

No.

specifically.

00:08:58.109 --> 00:08:59.078
than a middle man?

00:08:59.144 --> 00:09:01.983
[Xiangshan] And do
we really trust Gongjin?

00:09:02.618 --> 00:09:04.956
You got a status update
on that relic yet?

00:09:05.023 --> 00:09:05.858
[Man 2] Yes, sir.

00:09:05.925 --> 00:09:07.260
There's no proof it was removed

00:09:07.327 --> 00:09:09.364
from the Four Leaves
Technology premises

00:09:09.431 --> 00:09:11.803
but current location is unknown.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:13.774
Well, don't skimp out
on the surveillance

00:09:13.841 --> 00:09:15.410
over Sayuri Shiba.

00:09:15.477 --> 00:09:17.080
Speaking of Sayuri,

00:09:17.147 --> 00:09:19.218
did you find out anything about
the house she visited

00:09:19.284 --> 00:09:20.186
the other night?

00:09:20.253 --> 00:09:21.288
Yes, sir.

00:09:21.355 --> 00:09:22.759
We discovered that
her husband's children

00:09:22.825 --> 00:09:24.161
from another marriage
live there.

00:09:24.228 --> 00:09:25.330
Hmm.

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:27.267
Give me a rundown
on the kids.

00:09:27.334 --> 00:09:28.469
Two siblings,

00:09:28.537 --> 00:09:30.775
both freshmen at the Magic
University Affiliated

00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:32.043
First High School.

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:32.912
[Xiangshan] Names?

00:09:32.979 --> 00:09:34.682
The older brother
is named Tatsuya

00:09:34.749 --> 00:09:36.520
and the younger sister
is Miyuki.

00:09:36.586 --> 00:09:38.322
[Xiangshan] Tatsuya Shiba,
you say?

00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:41.095
He's the target
of our local collaborator's

00:09:41.162 --> 00:09:42.297
revenge plot.

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:44.301
[Xiangshan] Interesting.

00:09:44.368 --> 00:09:47.073
Magic University Affiliated
High School.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.848
We might be able to do something
with that information.

00:09:51.282 --> 00:09:54.154
Add First High School
to our list of targets.

00:09:54.221 --> 00:09:56.793
You may reallocate staff
from other missions.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.029
‐ [Man] Right.
‐ [Xiangshan] And increase

00:09:58.095 --> 00:10:00.099
our tactical support
for that girl.

00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:02.805
Also, let her know that leaking
classified documents

00:10:02.872 --> 00:10:04.441
is the most effective revenge.

00:10:04.509 --> 00:10:06.278
‐ [Man] Copy that.
‐ [Xiangshan] One more thing.

00:10:06.345 --> 00:10:08.282
‐ Give that kid a weapon, too.
‐ [Man] Yes, sir.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.721
‐ Captain Lu.
‐ Sir?

00:10:10.788 --> 00:10:12.525
Take charge on‐site.

00:10:13.259 --> 00:10:15.130
If anyone else
is sniffing around,

00:10:15.196 --> 00:10:16.132
eliminate them.

00:10:19.338 --> 00:10:21.576
[school bell ringing]

00:10:21.643 --> 00:10:23.279
Oh.
Hi, Tatsuya.

00:10:23.346 --> 00:10:24.749
You're early today.

00:10:25.483 --> 00:10:26.887
Yeah.

00:10:26.953 --> 00:10:27.955
[groans]

00:10:28.022 --> 00:10:29.324
[Tatsuya] Did I
interrupt something?

00:10:29.391 --> 00:10:31.630
[Erika] Mizuki can sense
someone's gaze.

00:10:31.696 --> 00:10:33.132
Huh?

00:10:33.199 --> 00:10:35.504
And I've been sensing some
unpleasant watchfulness

00:10:35.571 --> 00:10:36.840
all day today.

00:10:37.207 --> 00:10:40.079
Like someone's secretly peering
through cracks from the shadows.

00:10:40.146 --> 00:10:41.883
It's a creepy sort of staring.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:44.087
Do you mean like a stalker?

00:10:44.622 --> 00:10:46.793
Not really.
It's not after just me.

00:10:47.194 --> 00:10:49.866
It's more like it's something
or someone that's ready

00:10:49.933 --> 00:10:51.703
to cast out a wide net.

00:10:52.103 --> 00:10:54.208
So it's not targeting
a single student

00:10:54.274 --> 00:10:55.443
nor an instructor.

00:10:55.511 --> 00:10:57.047
Multiple instead.

00:10:57.447 --> 00:11:00.153
Maybe it's after
something located at school.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.825
It's possible
but for all we know,

00:11:02.892 --> 00:11:04.996
I may very well be wrong
about all this.

00:11:05.063 --> 00:11:07.167
[Mikihiko] No, I wouldn't doubt
that you're correct,

00:11:07.234 --> 00:11:07.969
Miss Shibata.

00:11:08.035 --> 00:11:09.104
Since this morning,

00:11:09.171 --> 00:11:10.741
the spirits have
been unnaturally frenzied

00:11:10.808 --> 00:11:11.877
around campus.

00:11:11.943 --> 00:11:12.945
If I had to guess,

00:11:13.012 --> 00:11:14.782
I'd say somebody's evoked
a shiki.

00:11:14.849 --> 00:11:16.252
Shiki, huh?

00:11:16.318 --> 00:11:18.289
Are you talking about those
spiritual beings known

00:11:18.356 --> 00:11:19.258
as shikigami?

00:11:19.324 --> 00:11:20.561
Mm.

00:11:20.628 --> 00:11:22.397
[Mikihiko] It appears to be
a different type of spell

00:11:22.464 --> 00:11:25.336
than we use so I can't quite get
a handle on it,

00:11:25.403 --> 00:11:27.107
but there's no question
in my mind

00:11:27.173 --> 00:11:29.344
that a spell caster
is sniffing around nearby.

00:11:29.411 --> 00:11:30.781
Hang on.

00:11:31.248 --> 00:11:33.954
Did you just say they're using
a spell different than ours?

00:11:34.021 --> 00:11:34.856
Yes.

00:11:34.923 --> 00:11:36.358
I believe so.

00:11:36.693 --> 00:11:37.828
[Tatsuya] And just to be clear,

00:11:37.895 --> 00:11:40.099
you're saying it's
a non‐Shinto spell?

00:11:40.333 --> 00:11:41.468
Is that it,

00:11:41.536 --> 00:11:43.272
or do you mean that it's
a spell which is different

00:11:43.339 --> 00:11:45.778
in nature from this country's
ancient magic?

00:11:48.482 --> 00:11:51.055
I don't think it's part
of Japan's ancient magic.

00:11:53.292 --> 00:11:56.065
[Inagaki] How did nobody notice
<i>that illegal entry incident?</i>

00:11:56.131 --> 00:11:57.935
<i>Should we keep on canvasing?</i>

00:11:58.002 --> 00:12:00.574
Not that I think we'll suddenly
find witnesses

00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:02.043
if we walk any farther.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.582
Oh, there's bound to be somebody
out there who saw.

00:12:04.649 --> 00:12:06.418
They just won't talk to us.

00:12:06.485 --> 00:12:07.989
Wait, what are you‐‐

00:12:08.055 --> 00:12:10.159
Don't give me that look,
assistant inspector.

00:12:10.226 --> 00:12:12.531
You're the one
who's giving me a look.

00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:14.067
What are you planning on doing?

00:12:14.134 --> 00:12:15.604
Don't worry, Inagaki.

00:12:15.671 --> 00:12:17.307
I'm not gonna do
an illegal search.

00:12:17.374 --> 00:12:18.710
You know that
classic expression,

00:12:18.777 --> 00:12:20.681
"Snake paths lead to snakes?"

00:12:20.748 --> 00:12:22.150
That bit of wisdom
is why I thought

00:12:22.217 --> 00:12:23.987
we'd visit a den of serpents.

00:12:29.331 --> 00:12:30.400
<i>Hold up.</i>

00:12:30.466 --> 00:12:32.070
<i>There's nothing wrong</i>
<i>with taking</i>

00:12:32.137 --> 00:12:33.840
<i>a little break from our work</i>
<i>every now and then,</i>

00:12:33.907 --> 00:12:35.410
<i>but I thought you said we</i>
<i>were gonna visit</i>

00:12:35.476 --> 00:12:36.980
<i>a den of snakes first.</i>

00:12:37.047 --> 00:12:38.817
<i>Yeah, this tavern</i>
<i>is a den of snakes.</i>

00:12:38.884 --> 00:12:40.186
<i>Huh?</i>

00:12:40.253 --> 00:12:41.623
[Toshikazu] The old codger
who runs this place

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:44.929
is quite a know‐it‐all.
A so‐called information broker.

00:12:44.996 --> 00:12:46.498
[car door closes]

00:12:46.833 --> 00:12:47.969
[Honoka] So Tatsuya,

00:12:48.035 --> 00:12:49.104
are you all finished
getting ready

00:12:49.171 --> 00:12:50.975
for the thesis competition?

00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:53.279
I suppose you could say
we've reached a plateau.

00:12:53.814 --> 00:12:56.418
We still need to rehearse,
build our presentation models,

00:12:56.485 --> 00:12:58.924
and calibrate our spells
for the demo.

00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:00.861
So all of the little details.

00:13:00.928 --> 00:13:02.765
[Mari] Sounds like
a lot of work.

00:13:02.832 --> 00:13:05.069
Hey, Mizuki,
come to think of it,

00:13:05.136 --> 00:13:07.407
are you helping out their team
with the models?

00:13:07.775 --> 00:13:10.179
Well, the second years
are assisting them in general

00:13:10.246 --> 00:13:12.952
but personally
I'm not doing anything.

00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:14.989
[Tatsuya] Since Miss Ichihara
and I are leaving

00:13:15.056 --> 00:13:16.358
the models to Isori,

00:13:16.425 --> 00:13:18.329
I guess it's only natural
the second years

00:13:18.396 --> 00:13:19.632
would lean to me.

00:13:19.699 --> 00:13:20.901
[Leonhard] Yeah,
that makes sense.

00:13:20.968 --> 00:13:23.239
But then what are you
in charge of, Tatsuya?

00:13:23.306 --> 00:13:25.944
I'm fine tuning our spells
for the demos.

00:13:26.011 --> 00:13:26.980
[Shizuku] You'd think
it would be

00:13:27.047 --> 00:13:28.316
the other way around.

00:13:30.521 --> 00:13:31.990
[Tatsuya] Wanna stop here
for a little bit?

00:13:32.057 --> 00:13:33.660
[Erika] Yeah, I'm down.

00:13:34.027 --> 00:13:35.029
[Leonhard] Might as well since

00:13:35.096 --> 00:13:36.866
you're gonna
be swamped tomorrow.

00:13:36.933 --> 00:13:37.902
[Mikihiko] Exactly.

00:13:37.968 --> 00:13:38.870
You should grab tea with us

00:13:38.937 --> 00:13:40.106
while you're still free.

00:13:43.112 --> 00:13:45.450
[Man 3] Oh, so you're going
to participate

00:13:45.517 --> 00:13:47.187
in the magic thesis competition,
huh?

00:13:47.253 --> 00:13:49.124
That's really interesting.

00:13:49.191 --> 00:13:50.493
In fact I heard that
they're hosting it

00:13:50.561 --> 00:13:52.330
in Yokohama this year,
which is cool,

00:13:52.397 --> 00:13:53.900
because that's where
my parents live.

00:13:53.967 --> 00:13:55.136
Do you know
if they're holding it

00:13:55.203 --> 00:13:56.906
at the International
Convention Center again?

00:13:56.973 --> 00:13:58.409
That's close
to my parents' house.

00:13:58.476 --> 00:14:00.814
Where in Yokohama
do your parents live?

00:14:00.881 --> 00:14:02.918
[Man 3] About halfway up
the Yamate Hills.

00:14:02.985 --> 00:14:04.756
The ground floor
is also their restaurant.

00:14:04.822 --> 00:14:05.924
It's called Roter Wald.

00:14:07.027 --> 00:14:08.563
[Toshikazu] We'll take coffees.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.333
Coming right up, sir.

00:14:12.303 --> 00:14:13.339
Huh?

00:14:18.249 --> 00:14:19.284
Hmm.

00:14:19.552 --> 00:14:20.521
Mm?

00:14:20.587 --> 00:14:21.589
[clears throat]

00:14:21.656 --> 00:14:22.691
Huh?
[chair drags]

00:14:22.758 --> 00:14:23.894
[both gasping]
[Kyouko giggling]

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.430
Please forgive me.

00:14:25.798 --> 00:14:28.235
I've been wondering when you
were going to chat me up,

00:14:28.302 --> 00:14:31.075
but you don't seem to have
the slightest inclination.

00:14:31.141 --> 00:14:34.549
Are you nervous around women,
scion of the Chiba clan?

00:14:34.615 --> 00:14:36.820
Uh, who are you?

00:14:37.588 --> 00:14:41.261
[Kyouko] A pleasure to meet you,
Inspector Toshikazu Chiba.

00:14:41.328 --> 00:14:44.869
And my name
is Kyouko Fujibayashi.

00:14:52.484 --> 00:14:53.553
[Erika] Hmm.

00:14:54.622 --> 00:14:55.891
Excuse me.

00:14:56.358 --> 00:14:57.962
Where are you going, Erika?

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:00.968
Off to the little girls' room.

00:15:01.335 --> 00:15:03.305
[Leonhard] One second, guys.
I'll be right back.

00:15:05.076 --> 00:15:06.145
[Tatsuya] Mikihiko.

00:15:06.211 --> 00:15:08.382
What are you doing back there,
huh?

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.086
[Mikihiko] Nothing important.

00:15:10.153 --> 00:15:13.025
Just jotting some stuff down
before it slips my mind.

00:15:14.094 --> 00:15:16.198
Be careful not
to blow your cover.

00:15:16.766 --> 00:15:18.202
[Tatsuya] Better go easy on it.

00:15:19.337 --> 00:15:20.974
[footsteps approaching]

00:15:21.041 --> 00:15:21.976
[Erika] Hey, mister.

00:15:22.043 --> 00:15:23.145
