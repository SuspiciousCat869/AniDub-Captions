fortifying magic.

00:16:18.857 --> 00:16:20.794
I'm Tatsuya Shiba,

00:16:20.861 --> 00:16:22.731
but you can just
call me Tatsuya.

00:16:22.798 --> 00:16:24.301
Okay, Tatsuya.

00:16:24.367 --> 00:16:26.471
So what are your signature
magic spells?

00:16:26.539 --> 00:16:28.643
My practical skills kind
of suck,

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:30.747
so I want to become
a magic engineer.

00:16:30.814 --> 00:16:32.116
Ah.

00:16:32.183 --> 00:16:34.354
Well, you do present
as a pretty brainy guy.

00:16:34.421 --> 00:16:35.891
[Erika] Hang on.
You're an aspiring

00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.193
magic engineer, Shiba?

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:38.630
Hey, dude.
Who are you?

00:16:38.697 --> 00:16:41.368
Whoa, you did not
just call me dude.

00:16:41.435 --> 00:16:42.771
So tacky.

00:16:42.838 --> 00:16:44.709
It's no wonder you're single.

00:16:44.775 --> 00:16:47.447
What the hell?
'Kay, now who's being tacky?

00:16:47.515 --> 00:16:49.117
Don't think you
can get away with it

00:16:49.184 --> 00:16:50.419
just because
you're slightly cute.

00:16:50.486 --> 00:16:51.990
[Erika] Uh, looks matter,
and you know it.

00:16:52.056 --> 00:16:53.192
Hey, so, Erika‐‐

00:16:53.259 --> 00:16:54.427
[Erika] Though that might not
be clear

00:16:54.494 --> 00:16:56.231

the wild look means

00:16:56.298 --> 00:16:57.701

[Mizuki] You, too, Erika.
That was a little too far.

00:17:24.254 --> 00:17:25.456
[Mizuki] That was so much fun.

00:17:25.524 --> 00:17:27.360
You know,
touring all the workshops.

00:17:27.427 --> 00:17:29.297
I'm studying to be
a magic engineer, too,

00:17:29.364 --> 00:17:31.101
so I got a lot out of that.

00:17:31.168 --> 00:17:32.871
[Tatsuya] Yeah,
that was pretty productive,

00:17:32.938 --> 00:17:34.174
wasn't it?

00:17:34.241 --> 00:17:36.345
I wonder if I'm up
to such painstaking work.

00:17:36.411 --> 00:17:38.082

‐ Of course you're not.

00:17:38.148 --> 00:17:39.317

‐ It's totally beyond you.

00:17:39.384 --> 00:17:40.887

Wait a sec!

00:17:40.954 --> 00:17:42.791
[Leonhard] Why are we all
eating lunch together?

00:17:42.858 --> 00:17:45.062
[Erika] I was just having lunch
with Mizuki and Tatsuya.

00:17:45.129 --> 00:17:47.033

00:17:48.536 --> 00:17:49.772
[Tatsuya] Miyuki.

00:17:50.239 --> 00:17:52.210
Do you mind if I sit here
with you?

00:17:52.277 --> 00:17:54.481
Here, you can come sit next
to me, Miyuki.

00:17:54.548 --> 00:17:56.385
[Miyuki] Okay.
Thanks, Erika.

00:17:56.953 --> 00:17:58.623
Uh, who's she?

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:00.928
My kid sister, Miyuki.

00:18:00.994 --> 00:18:02.163
Oh?

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:04.602
Nice to meet you.

00:18:09.377 --> 00:18:10.847
You shouldn't bother them.

00:18:11.214 --> 00:18:13.753
But I'd like to sit here and...

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:15.256
[Boy] Hmm?
Miyuki.

[exhales sharply]

00:18:16.759 --> 00:18:19.799
You shouldn't share a table
with a bunch of Weeds.

00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:22.070
‐ What?
‐ Lines need to be drawn between

00:18:22.136 --> 00:18:23.607

and course two.

00:18:23.673 --> 00:18:24.675

Miyuki, I'm done eating,
so I'm heading out now anyway.

00:18:36.699 --> 00:18:38.603
[Leonhard] Hey, Tatsuya!
Hold up, man!

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.172
[Erika] Tatsuya!

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.815
[Mizuki] Just give it up
and go away already, will you?

00:18:45.182 --> 00:18:47.220
[Boy] There's something pressing
we want to discuss with her,

00:18:47.286 --> 00:18:48.422
that's all!

00:18:48.489 --> 00:18:49.759
[Girl] That's right!
Come on!

00:18:49.825 --> 00:18:51.461
Brother, I'm sorry.

00:18:51.529 --> 00:18:53.933
Please don't start apologizing,
Miyuki.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.004
All right,
but I...

00:18:56.238 --> 00:18:58.008
[Mizuki] Besides,
didn't you hear Miyuki say

00:18:58.075 --> 00:18:59.879
she's going home
with her brother?

00:19:00.246 --> 00:19:02.951
What do you think you're doing,
trying to split these two apart?

00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:04.220
You have no right.

00:19:04.287 --> 00:19:05.289
Oh, Mizuki!

00:19:05.356 --> 00:19:06.491
What exactly is it that you're,

00:19:06.559 --> 00:19:08.495
uh, misunderstanding here?

00:19:09.064 --> 00:19:10.166
Miyuki.

00:19:10.534 --> 00:19:11.836
Why are you in such a panic?

00:19:11.903 --> 00:19:13.606
Oh, me?
No, no.

00:19:13.673 --> 00:19:15.744
I'm not remotely panicking,
am I?

00:19:15.811 --> 00:19:17.480
Another question isn't
an answer.

[Mizuki] We're all

Who do you think you are,
making such a claim?

could you Blooms be?

why don't you go ahead
and show us?

[Boy] All right, then.

00:19:47.206 --> 00:19:48.676

Unless they're in self defense,

[Tatsuya] Sorry about that.

[grunts]

00:21:03.492 --> 00:21:05.463
[Tatsuya] Just horseplay
that got out of hand.

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.534
Is that really what happened?

00:21:07.601 --> 00:21:08.469
Yes.

The Morisaki clan is famous

00:21:11.943 --> 00:21:14.114

to show me so I'd be aware

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.617
for future reference,

00:21:15.684 --> 00:21:18.556
but it was just so realistic
that I couldn't stop myself

00:21:18.623 --> 00:21:19.758
from making a move.

Fine, then would you care
to explain to me why

that girl was about to activate
an attack‐type spell

00:21:26.271 --> 00:21:27.708
when we arrived?

00:21:28.208 --> 00:21:30.012
That was just a flash spell.

00:21:30.079 --> 00:21:31.114
Nothing to worry about,

00:21:31.181 --> 00:21:34.120
