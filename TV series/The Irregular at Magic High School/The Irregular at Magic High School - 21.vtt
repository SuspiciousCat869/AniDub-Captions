00:08:48.456 --> 00:08:49.726
My intent was to hack in

and rewrite
the device's program.

00:08:51.897 --> 00:08:54.201
I was trying to disable
the magical apparatus

00:08:54.268 --> 00:08:56.005
for their presentation.

00:08:56.873 --> 00:08:59.011
[Kanon] So you wanted
the presentation to fail.

00:08:59.078 --> 00:09:00.113
That's not it.

he would just find a way
to recover,

00:09:04.488 --> 00:09:06.492
but I thought he would
at least panic a little bit

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.630
if I could manage
to sabotage him.

00:09:08.997 --> 00:09:10.868
[Kanon] You really did that out
of spite?

00:09:10.935 --> 00:09:12.304
Depending on the outcome,

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:14.341
you could have gotten
yourself expelled, you know.

00:09:14.408 --> 00:09:15.878
[Chiaki] I don't care!

00:09:16.445 --> 00:09:20.988

one over on that jerk!

younger sister?

‐ [gasps]
‐ [Kei] And you think

00:09:35.183 --> 00:09:36.653
it's Shiba's fault
that your sister

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.791
can no longer make good use
of magic?

00:09:39.324 --> 00:09:41.162
She ended up that way because
of him.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.736
After all, Shiba left
Miss Keiko for dead, didn't he?

00:09:45.103 --> 00:09:48.042
[Chiaki] And because of that,
my sister feels responsible.

00:09:48.744 --> 00:09:50.714
If Shiba was
in any way responsible

00:09:50.781 --> 00:09:52.718
for Miss Kobayakawa's accident,

00:09:52.785 --> 00:09:54.455
then everyone on
the engineering staff

00:09:54.522 --> 00:09:56.358

Mr. Isori!

00:10:06.546 --> 00:10:09.786
It's because of who he really is
that Chiba was able to see it!

00:10:09.853 --> 00:10:11.957
[Chiaki] He admitted it himself!

00:10:12.457 --> 00:10:14.863

he's still out there.
