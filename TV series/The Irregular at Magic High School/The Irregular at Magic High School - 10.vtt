Mizuki, what a surprise
to see you here.

00:08:02.464 --> 00:08:03.834
[gasps]

00:08:04.435 --> 00:08:06.205
[Mizuki] Uh, Miyuki,
what's up?

00:08:06.272 --> 00:08:07.274
Is something wrong?

00:08:07.341 --> 00:08:09.111
Uh, your outfit.

00:08:09.178 --> 00:08:10.715
Is it too revealing?

00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:12.785
Erika told me that I
should lighten up a bit

00:08:12.852 --> 00:08:14.589
for this trip,
so that's why I wore it.

00:08:14.656 --> 00:08:15.958
‐ [gasps]
‐ Oh.

00:08:16.025 --> 00:08:17.160
[whistles]

00:08:17.227 --> 00:08:19.264
Mizuki, please don't take this
the wrong way,

00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:21.670
but I think you should change
as soon as possible.

00:08:21.737 --> 00:08:24.341
It's very becoming on you
and you look lovely,

00:08:24.408 --> 00:08:25.845
but I don't think
it's appropriate.

00:08:25.911 --> 00:08:27.381
‐ That's what I told her.
‐ Huh?

00:08:27.447 --> 00:08:28.617
You sure about that?

00:08:28.684 --> 00:08:30.955
Incidentally,
are you two staying here?

00:08:31.022 --> 00:08:33.026
‐ [Mizuki] Yeah.
‐ Doesn't this hotel belong

00:08:33.092 --> 00:08:34.361
to the military, though?

00:08:34.428 --> 00:08:35.263
[Erika] Well, I've got
a hook‐up.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.633
[both gasping]

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.539
That's the Chiba family.
I'm surprised, though.

00:08:39.606 --> 00:08:40.875
Correct me if I'm wrong,

00:08:40.941 --> 00:08:42.612
but I thought you said
you didn't like throwing

00:08:42.678 --> 00:08:43.547
your family's name around.

00:08:43.614 --> 00:08:44.783
That's fine.

00:08:44.849 --> 00:08:46.152
What I don't like
is people being biased

00:08:46.218 --> 00:08:47.989
towards me just because I'm
a Chiba.

00:08:48.056 --> 00:08:50.460
I mean, what good are your
connections unless you use them?

00:08:50.995 --> 00:08:52.497
It would be a waste not to.

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:54.001
Well, that's true,

00:08:54.068 --> 00:08:55.838
but the tournament
doesn't start until

00:08:55.905 --> 00:08:57.207
the day after tomorrow.

00:08:57.274 --> 00:08:58.544
[chuckles]
Well, there's a banquet tonight,

00:08:58.610 --> 00:08:59.913
right?

00:08:59.979 --> 00:09:01.583
But they're not going
to let outsiders attend.

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:03.252
Hey, I've got that covered, too.

00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:05.991
This evening,
we're insiders.

00:09:06.058 --> 00:09:07.260
Huh?

00:09:09.364 --> 00:09:12.270
[indistinct chatter]

00:09:17.882 --> 00:09:19.418
[Erika] Would you care
for a drink, sir?

00:09:19.485 --> 00:09:20.921
Huh?

00:09:21.823 --> 00:09:23.761
[Tatsuya] So this
is what you meant by "insider?"

00:09:23.827 --> 00:09:25.531
[chuckles]
Miyuki told you, huh?

00:09:25.598 --> 00:09:26.700
You surprised?

00:09:26.767 --> 00:09:27.969
Sure, I'm surprised.

00:09:28.035 --> 00:09:29.606
Impressed more than anything.

00:09:29.906 --> 00:09:32.678
Actually,
that is to be expected.

00:09:32.745 --> 00:09:34.381
[Tatsuya] Still,
having said that...

00:09:34.448 --> 00:09:35.885
Hmm?
What do you mean?

00:09:35.951 --> 00:09:38.089
‐ It's nothing.
‐ Good evening, Erika.

00:09:38.156 --> 00:09:39.993
What a lovely outfit
you've got on.

00:09:40.059 --> 00:09:41.630
I know.
Isn't it cute?

00:09:41.696 --> 00:09:44.234
Not that Tatsuya
said anything about it.

00:09:44.301 --> 00:09:47.073
There is simply no use
in expecting such things

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:47.975
of my brother.

00:09:48.042 --> 00:09:48.977
‐ [grunts]
‐ After all,

00:09:49.044 --> 00:09:50.581
he has never been captivated

00:09:50.648 --> 00:09:51.883
by anything superficial,

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.620
such as what a girl may
have put on.

00:09:53.687 --> 00:09:54.956
[chuckles]
So Tatsuya,

00:09:55.023 --> 00:09:56.358
I guess you don't have
any interest

00:09:56.425 --> 00:09:57.628
in cosplay then, huh?

00:09:57.695 --> 00:09:59.666
Wait, your outfit is cosplay?

00:10:00.099 --> 00:10:02.170
Well, I didn't think it
was when I got it,

00:10:02.237 --> 00:10:04.909
but guys seem to see it that way
for some reason.

00:10:04.976 --> 00:10:07.214
When you say guys,
do you mean Leonhard Saijou?

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.249
Uh‐uh.

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:10.053
Miki's the one
who called it cosplay.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.424
Needless to say,
I chastised him thoroughly.

00:10:12.491 --> 00:10:13.894
‐ Who's Miki?
‐ Uh‐‐

00:10:13.961 --> 00:10:16.198
that's right.
You don't know him, do you?

00:10:16.265 --> 00:10:17.802
‐ [grunts]
‐ [Miyuki] Wait, Erika!

00:10:18.369 --> 00:10:20.508
Now, what in the world
was that about?

00:10:20.574 --> 00:10:23.146
Maybe she ran off
to get Mikihiko?

00:10:23.212 --> 00:10:25.049
[Shizuku] Miyuki,
so there you are.

00:10:25.416 --> 00:10:28.022
And Tatsuya's with you!
It's good to see you both.

00:10:28.422 --> 00:10:30.728
You two are always together,
too, aren't you?

00:10:30.794 --> 00:10:32.097
It's because we're friends.

00:10:32.164 --> 00:10:34.268
We have no reason not
to be together.

00:10:34.903 --> 00:10:35.971
I guess you don't.

00:10:36.038 --> 00:10:37.809
Where are all the others?
[grunts]

00:10:37.875 --> 00:10:39.044
They're over there.

00:10:39.512 --> 00:10:41.348
[Shizuku] I think they want
to approach you, Miyuki,

00:10:41.415 --> 00:10:44.454
but they know it's not happening
as long as Tatsuya's around.

00:10:44.522 --> 00:10:45.825
So what am I?
A watchdog?

00:10:45.891 --> 00:10:47.795
Oh, I'm sure that they
are just nervous

00:10:47.862 --> 00:10:50.166
and feel uncertain about how
to approach you, Tatsuya.

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:51.335
‐ [Kanon] It's ridiculous.
‐ all: Huh?

00:10:51.402 --> 00:10:53.272
Considering he's a student
at First High

00:10:53.339 --> 00:10:55.176
and a teammate now no less,
right?

00:10:55.778 --> 00:10:57.314
Miss Chiyoda.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.351
Some things are easier said
than done.

00:10:59.418 --> 00:11:01.388
That's human nature,
after all, isn't it?

00:11:01.455 --> 00:11:03.861
That is only acceptable
in certain situations.

00:11:03.927 --> 00:11:05.998
Those are both sound arguments.

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:06.900
For now,

00:11:06.967 --> 00:11:08.369
there's an even simpler solution

00:11:08.436 --> 00:11:09.606
to our predicament, though.

00:11:10.073 --> 00:11:12.945
Miyuki, you should just
go join the others.

00:11:13.012 --> 00:11:15.416
Team camaraderie is crucial,
after all.

00:11:15.951 --> 00:11:18.389
[exhales]
Very well, Brother.

00:11:20.026 --> 00:11:21.930
[Kanon] What a mature way
of handling it.

00:11:21.997 --> 00:11:22.999
Hmm?

00:11:23.065 --> 00:11:24.736
Well,
I think we'll get going now.

00:11:24.802 --> 00:11:25.971
[giggles]

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.844
Hey, where's Miyuki?

00:11:29.211 --> 00:11:31.348
I had her join
the other athletes.

00:11:31.415 --> 00:11:32.885
You can meet her later.

00:11:32.952 --> 00:11:34.989
[Mikihara] Oh, sure.
Don't worry about it.

00:11:35.323 --> 00:11:37.294
The thought of meeting someone
while dressed like this

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.231
was a little
embarrassing anyway.

00:11:39.599 --> 00:11:42.103
Well, isn't that how
a hospitality worker dresses?

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:43.974
[Erika] See, Miki?
You're too insecure.

00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:46.078
Cut it out.
My name is Mikihiko.

00:11:46.145 --> 00:11:48.917
By the way,
I don't see Leo and Miss Mizuki.

00:11:48.984 --> 00:11:50.286
They're here, aren't they?

00:11:50.353 --> 00:11:52.858
You really think Leo
could hack it as a waiter?

00:11:52.925 --> 00:11:55.230
I'm sure he can manage
to adapt himself

00:11:55.296 --> 00:11:56.332
at the very least.

00:11:56.398 --> 00:11:59.004
Mizuki didn't wanna wear
this awesome uniform.

00:11:59.071 --> 00:12:00.841
[Erika] You two might hit
it off, Miki.

00:12:00.908 --> 00:12:02.945
For the last time,
my name is Mikihiko!

00:12:03.012 --> 00:12:04.314
[Erika] All right,
whatever you say.

00:12:04.381 --> 00:12:05.383
So anyway,

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.420
Leo's in the kitchen
doing manual labor

00:12:07.487 --> 00:12:09.324
and Mizuki's washing the dishes.

00:12:09.391 --> 00:12:11.896
I thought you said I'd be
working behind the scenes, too.

00:12:11.963 --> 00:12:12.965
Why'd you make me‐‐

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:15.069
I've told you 100 times now.

00:12:15.136 --> 00:12:16.338
There was a little mix up, okay?

00:12:16.405 --> 00:12:17.575
But what kind of mix up?

00:12:17.642 --> 00:12:19.144
All right,
don't throw a hissy fit.

00:12:19.211 --> 00:12:21.448
Look, I can see an empty plate
over there.

00:12:21.516 --> 00:12:22.718
‐ [groans]
‐ [giggles]

00:12:23.119 --> 00:12:24.889
‐ This isn't over by a long shot
‐ [scoffs]

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.597
I think you should go
a little bit easier on him.

00:12:28.664 --> 00:12:29.666
Huh?

00:12:29.732 --> 00:12:31.001
Uh...

00:12:31.235 --> 00:12:32.170
You're right.

00:12:32.237 --> 00:12:34.341
Maybe I was lashing out
at him a little.

00:12:34.408 --> 00:12:36.513
I know all too well Miki's
not comfortable

00:12:36.579 --> 00:12:37.815
with this kind of thing.

00:12:38.583 --> 00:12:39.519
It's just...

00:12:40.621 --> 00:12:42.190
Did you want to make him angry?

00:12:42.558 --> 00:12:44.361
[Erika] Mm, I dunno about that.

00:12:44.428 --> 00:12:47.334
He's lost his confidence
so I admit I get frustrated

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.436
just watching him.

00:12:48.937 --> 00:12:50.206
[Tatsuya] You're a good friend.

00:12:50.273 --> 00:12:51.610
Oh, stop it.

00:12:51.977 --> 00:12:54.414
Neither one of us
is working here today

00:12:54.481 --> 00:12:55.684
of our own free will.

00:12:56.251 --> 00:12:58.289
It's because our parents
forced us.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.561
It may look like
I'm sympathetic.

00:13:00.628 --> 00:13:02.030
We're in the same boat,

00:13:02.097 --> 00:13:04.034
so we just feel sorry
for each other.

00:13:05.103 --> 00:13:06.640
I'm not going to pry.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.777
[Tatsuya] It wouldn't be
of any help.

00:13:09.378 --> 00:13:11.448
[Erika] Sorry,
I hope you don't mind.

00:13:12.885 --> 00:13:14.756
Hey, know what, Tatsuya?

00:13:14.822 --> 00:13:15.991
What's wrong?

00:13:16.058 --> 00:13:19.064
I realize now,
you're kinda cold.

00:13:19.766 --> 00:13:21.068
Where did that come from?

00:13:21.368 --> 00:13:22.805
Dunno,
but the weird thing is,

00:13:22.872 --> 00:13:24.776
I like it this way,
I think.

00:13:24.842 --> 00:13:26.780
Since you're not too caring,

00:13:26.846 --> 00:13:28.684
I can mouth off all I want.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:32.858
[Erika] You don't show pity
so I don't feel pathetic.

00:13:33.326 --> 00:13:34.261
[grunts]

00:13:34.896 --> 00:13:36.131
Thanks for that.

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.734
[Boy] Shut up, man!
Lay off me, will ya?

00:14:10.801 --> 00:14:11.836
[Boy 2 laughing]

00:14:11.903 --> 00:14:13.372
Masaki,
what are you staring at?

00:14:14.041 --> 00:14:15.143
Just a girl.

00:14:15.209 --> 00:14:16.646
Tell me.
What do you know about her?

00:14:16.713 --> 00:14:17.982
Huh?
Oh.

00:14:18.049 --> 00:14:20.019
Her name is Miss Miyuki Shiba.

00:14:20.554 --> 00:14:22.658
[Shinkurou] She'll be competing
in Ice Pillars Break

00:14:22.725 --> 00:14:23.860
and Mirage Bat.

00:14:24.194 --> 00:14:26.198
She's First High's top freshman.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.770
Miyuki Shiba, huh?

00:14:28.837 --> 00:14:30.306
That's unusual.

00:14:30.373 --> 00:14:32.678
I hardly remember the last time
a girl caught your eye.

00:14:32.745 --> 00:14:34.414
Trust me.
It's not like that.

00:14:34.481 --> 00:14:35.517
[Man] Excuse me.

00:14:35.584 --> 00:14:38.355
At tonight's Nine Schools
Competition banquet,

00:14:38.422 --> 00:14:41.796
we are honored to have a number
of eminent guests in attendance.

00:14:42.665 --> 00:14:46.071
Let us now take this opportunity
to hear some words of wisdom

00:14:46.138 --> 00:14:48.710
from the association chairman
Retsu Kudou.

00:14:48.777 --> 00:14:50.814
Patriarch
of the Ten Master Clans?

00:14:50.881 --> 00:14:52.417
Yeah, although I've never
actually seen him

00:14:52.484 --> 00:14:53.419
in person before.

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:01.335
[gasps]

00:15:01.402 --> 00:15:02.605
<i>[Tatsuya] Is this gonna</i>
<i>be trouble?</i>

00:15:02.671 --> 00:15:05.376
[indistinct whispers]

00:15:06.078 --> 00:15:08.015
<i>No, that's not it.</i>

00:15:08.082 --> 00:15:10.253
It's sensory interference magic.

00:15:10.788 --> 00:15:13.125
<i>Did he invoke</i>
<i>a large scale spell covering</i>

00:15:13.192 --> 00:15:14.629
<i>the entire banquet hall?</i>

00:15:22.611 --> 00:15:25.517
[all gasping]

00:15:28.022 --> 00:15:28.957
[chuckles]

00:15:29.024 --> 00:15:30.293
[gasps]

00:15:30.359 --> 00:15:31.395
[chuckles]

00:15:33.567 --> 00:15:35.871
First, let me apologize
for making you a party

00:15:35.938 --> 00:15:37.240
to my prank tonight.

00:15:38.677 --> 00:15:40.781
[Retsu] What you just saw
was more slight of hand

00:15:40.848 --> 00:15:42.383
than true magic.

00:15:42.685 --> 00:15:43.887
As far as I could tell,

00:15:43.954 --> 00:15:45.724
there were only five of you

00:15:45.791 --> 00:15:48.663
who were able to see through it
for the magic trick it was.

00:15:49.665 --> 00:15:50.601
In other words,

00:15:50.667 --> 00:15:53.105
just imagine if I
had been a terrorist.

00:15:53.172 --> 00:15:55.109
What would have happened
if I unleashed poison

00:15:55.176 --> 00:15:56.411
or bombs on you all?

00:15:56.478 --> 00:15:58.583
Given the gullibility
I saw here tonight,

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:00.921
unfortunately only five
of you would have been able

00:16:00.988 --> 00:16:02.390
to do anything to stop me.

00:16:02.457 --> 00:16:03.359
[all gasping]

00:16:03.425 --> 00:16:06.064
My young students
of the arcane arts,

00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:08.135
understand that magic
is a means.

00:16:08.202 --> 00:16:10.473
Magic is not in
and of itself your goal.

00:16:10.541 --> 00:16:11.576
[gasps]

00:16:11.643 --> 00:16:13.914
What little magic
I had used just now,

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.918
although it was quite large
in scale,

00:16:15.984 --> 00:16:19.090
was very low in potency,
and yet,

00:16:19.157 --> 00:16:21.830
most of you were deceived
by this rather weak magic

00:16:21.896 --> 00:16:24.602
and therefore failed
to perceive my presence here.

00:16:25.036 --> 00:16:26.471
[Retsu] You should never
allow yourself

00:16:26.539 --> 00:16:29.477
to be remiss in your efforts
to improve your magic skills.

00:16:29.545 --> 00:16:30.781
That being said,

00:16:30.848 --> 00:16:33.018
I'd like you to keep in mind
that your efforts alone

00:16:33.085 --> 00:16:34.421
won't be enough.

00:16:34.889 --> 00:16:37.327
Large scale magic
used erroneously

00:16:37.393 --> 00:16:40.868
is inferior to small scale magic
used creatively.

00:16:41.368 --> 00:16:43.607
Let me leave you
with this one final thought.

00:16:43.673 --> 00:16:47.380
I'm looking forward to seeing
how creative each of you can be.

00:16:48.115 --> 00:16:50.219
[indistinct chatter]

00:16:51.589 --> 00:16:54.529
[applause]

00:16:56.733 --> 00:16:57.968
<i>[Tatsuya] The man</i>
<i>at the pinnacle</i>

00:16:58.035 --> 00:17:00.039
<i>of Japan's magic society.</i>

00:17:01.008 --> 00:17:02.545
<i>The patriarch, huh?</i>

00:17:03.245 --> 00:17:04.481
[crickets chirping]

00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:06.051
<i>[Honoka] So it all</i>
<i>starts tomorrow?</i>

00:17:06.118 --> 00:17:07.988
I'm too anxious to sleep!

00:17:08.055 --> 00:17:09.792
It's too early to be nervous.

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:12.698
Honoka, the rookie events
don't start until day four,

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:14.367
remember?
Hey, Shizuku,

00:17:14.434 --> 00:17:16.471
which of tomorrows events
do you recommend?

00:17:16.539 --> 00:17:19.912
Chairwoman Saegusa's
speed shooting is a must‐see.

00:17:19.979 --> 00:17:21.883
She's a shoe‐in
to win the event,

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:22.985
but it will be a treat

00:17:23.052 --> 00:17:24.789
to see how
the Elven Sniper does

00:17:24.855 --> 00:17:27.460
in the final season
of her high school career.

00:17:27.962 --> 00:17:29.532
Wait,
the Elven Sniper?

00:17:29.599 --> 00:17:32.538
Miss Saegusa's nickname,
although it's unofficial.

00:17:32.605 --> 00:17:35.844
I bet Mayumi has a ton of fans.
[knocking]

00:17:35.911 --> 00:17:37.615
Oh, I'll go get the door.

00:17:39.986 --> 00:17:41.221
Evening, Honoka.

00:17:41.288 --> 00:17:42.858
Oh, hey, Eimi.

00:17:42.925 --> 00:17:44.394
Everyone's here.
What's going on?

00:17:44.461 --> 00:17:45.764
[giggles]
Get ready!

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:47.902
We're all going
to the hot spring together.

00:17:47.968 --> 00:17:49.739
‐ Really?
‐ Oh, yeah.

00:17:49.805 --> 00:17:51.709
I thought I heard they had
an artificial hot spring

00:17:51.776 --> 00:17:53.412
in the basement of this hotel,
right?

00:17:53.479 --> 00:17:55.449
Is it open to civilians, though?

00:17:55.517 --> 00:17:57.020
‐ [gasps]
‐ The military owns it.

00:17:57.086 --> 00:17:58.790
Good news.
I asked them nicely.

00:17:58.857 --> 00:18:00.761
They said it would be okay
until 11:00.

00:18:00.827 --> 00:18:01.729
‐ Huh?
‐ [gasps]

00:18:06.405 --> 00:18:07.875
[Eimi] Hey, can I touch them?

00:18:07.942 --> 00:18:09.177
‐ [Honoka screams]
‐ [gasps]

00:18:09.812 --> 00:18:12.551
Oh, my God, Honoka.
Your body's amazing!

00:18:13.185 --> 00:18:14.822
Honoka, come here!

00:18:15.489 --> 00:18:16.993
What do you think you're doing,
Eimi?

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:18.863
[Honoka whimpers]

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:20.066
[screeches]

00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:21.769
[grunts]
Mind if I have a look?

00:18:21.836 --> 00:18:23.005
Of course I mind!

00:18:23.072 --> 00:18:25.242
‐ Shizuku, please help me!
‐ [laughing maniacally]

00:18:25.309 --> 00:18:26.813
Why not just show her?

00:18:26.879 --> 00:18:28.683
Shizuku!

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:29.752
[Honoka whimpering]

00:18:29.819 --> 00:18:30.954
[both grunting]

00:18:31.021 --> 00:18:32.256
‐ Please help!
‐ [Eiko laughing]

00:18:32.323 --> 00:18:33.459
[Honoka whimpers]

00:18:35.731 --> 00:18:38.002
[Shizuku] Face it, Honoka.
You've got a big bust.

00:18:38.068 --> 00:18:39.237
[Honoka] That's not my fault!

00:18:39.304 --> 00:18:41.976
She said it was okay.
Let's just do it.

00:18:42.043 --> 00:18:43.713
‐ I'll help you, Eimi.
‐ [gasps]

00:18:44.247 --> 00:18:46.151
[Honoka] No!

00:18:46.218 --> 00:18:48.590
[all laughing]

00:18:48.657 --> 00:18:49.725
You guys,

00:18:49.792 --> 00:18:51.161
what on Earth is all
this commotion about?

00:18:51.228 --> 00:18:52.564
[all gasping]

00:18:56.839 --> 00:18:59.144
Mm, mm.

00:18:59.578 --> 00:19:00.547
Uh?

00:19:00.614 --> 00:19:02.350
[all gasping]

00:19:04.822 --> 00:19:06.191
Wh‐‐what is it?

00:19:06.258 --> 00:19:07.828
Oh, uh, sorry about that.

00:19:07.895 --> 00:19:09.197
I was mesmerized for a moment.

00:19:09.264 --> 00:19:10.499
Hey, stop it, you guys.

00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:12.571
Miyuki's perfectly normal,
okay?

00:19:12.638 --> 00:19:13.873
Oh, come on.

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.343
[Miyuki] We're all girls here.

00:19:15.409 --> 00:19:17.848
What are you even trying to say?

00:19:17.915 --> 00:19:20.186
Yeah, it's just girls here.

00:19:20.252 --> 00:19:22.524
We know that,
but you are something else.

00:19:22.591 --> 00:19:25.162
[Subaru] It's hard to explain,
but looking at you, Miyuki,

00:19:25.229 --> 00:19:26.866
it's like gender doesn't matter.

00:19:26.933 --> 00:19:28.703
Your beauty transcends it.

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:31.709
Come on.
Will you please stop teasing me?

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.623
<i>[Eimi] Whoa, Miyuki!</i>

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:40.226
<i>[Honoka] You'd better cut</i>
<i>that out real quick.</i>

00:19:40.292 --> 00:19:41.428
<i>Get a hold of yourself,</i>

00:19:41.495 --> 00:19:42.564
<i>or every single one of us</i>

00:19:42.631 --> 00:19:43.600
<i>in here will end up soaking</i>

00:19:43.666 --> 00:19:45.469
<i>in a bath full of ice water!</i>

00:19:45.537 --> 00:19:48.342
[Subaru laughs]
Hey, we were just joking, okay?

00:19:48.409 --> 00:19:50.346
[Kazumi] That's right.
It was all in good fun.

00:19:50.413 --> 00:19:52.216
[Shizuku] What's up?

00:19:53.887 --> 00:19:55.122
[Kazumi] Oh, by the way,

00:19:55.189 --> 00:19:57.493
the prince of Third High
Ichijou's heir

00:19:57.561 --> 00:19:59.330
was here at the banquet tonight,
wasn't he?

00:19:59.397 --> 00:20:00.634
I saw him there.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.437
He was pretty hot.
Don't you think so?

00:20:02.504 --> 00:20:05.577
And the entire time he
was totally checking out Miyuki.

00:20:05.644 --> 00:20:07.180
What?
Was he really?

00:20:07.246 --> 00:20:08.382
‐ Love at first sight?
‐ Hey,

00:20:08.449 --> 00:20:10.086
maybe you two already have
a history!

00:20:10.152 --> 00:20:11.354
[all giggling]

00:20:11.421 --> 00:20:13.092
How about it, Miyuki?

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.831
I mean, the only time
I've ever seen Ichijou

00:20:15.897 --> 00:20:17.100
was in photographs.

00:20:17.166 --> 00:20:19.872
I didn't even see where
he was in the banquet hall.

00:20:19.939 --> 00:20:21.509
[grunts]
That's a bummer.

00:20:21.576 --> 00:20:23.212
So are you into guys who

00:20:23.278 --> 00:20:24.414
are more like your big brother,
then?

00:20:24.481 --> 00:20:25.784
‐ [gasps]
‐ Well,

00:20:25.851 --> 00:20:28.088
I'm not sure what
it is you're expecting to hear,

00:20:28.155 --> 00:20:31.094
but Tatsuya and I are siblings
by blood, in fact.

00:20:31.662 --> 00:20:33.933
It should come as no surprise
I've never thought of him

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.071
as a potential love interest.

00:20:36.672 --> 00:20:38.409
Well, of course not, right?
[both giggling]

00:20:38.475 --> 00:20:40.312
[Eimi] Okay, then.
What is your type?

00:20:40.379 --> 00:20:42.818
Huh?
I, uh, don't...

00:20:55.811 --> 00:20:57.346
Is someone there?

00:21:01.956 --> 00:21:03.158
[magical booming]

00:21:03.225 --> 00:21:04.895
Is this evil?

00:21:04.962 --> 00:21:07.066
Wait, could this be intruders?
[grunts]

00:21:07.133 --> 00:21:08.703
[breathing heavily]

00:21:12.878 --> 00:21:15.015
How can I be sure
that I'm strong enough?

00:21:17.153 --> 00:21:19.090
<i>[Mikihiko] If I hadn't lost</i>
<i>my abilities</i>
