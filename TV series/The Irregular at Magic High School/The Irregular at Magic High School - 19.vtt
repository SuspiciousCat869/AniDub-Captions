[Miyuki] Brother,

[Tatsuya] Of course.
No problem.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.265
Is it okay for you
to be down here, though?

I'm actually not busy at all.

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:28.571
Our secretary Honoka
and our treasurer Isori

00:04:28.637 --> 00:04:31.242
don't have much to do either,
so they're helping me out.

00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:37.087
What is it that you're
working on this afternoon, huh?

00:04:37.154 --> 00:04:40.193
Well, this is a research paper
on the Emerald Tablet.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.763
Oh, so more alchemy?

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.101
You sure have been reading
a whole lot of articles

00:04:44.168 --> 00:04:45.671
on that subject lately.

00:04:45.738 --> 00:04:47.441
What I'm pursuing
isn't knowledge

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:48.911
of alchemy itself.

00:04:48.978 --> 00:04:51.884
It's the formula for creating
a philosopher's stone.

00:04:52.552 --> 00:04:55.691
You wouldn't be preparing
to attempt substance conversion,

00:04:55.758 --> 00:04:57.294
would you?
That'd be foolish.

00:04:57.361 --> 00:04:58.664
Don't worry.
I'm not.

00:04:58.731 --> 00:05:00.000
[computer beeping]
Uh...

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.603
[Tatsuya]
The Philosopher's Stone

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.974
is a catalyst in spells
that convert base metals

00:05:04.041 --> 00:05:05.611
into precious metals.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.016
<i>Because it's a catalyst rather</i>

00:05:08.082 --> 00:05:09.786
<i>than an active</i>
<i>ingredient itself,</i>

00:05:09.853 --> 00:05:12.659
<i>that makes it a tool</i>
<i>for activating the process.</i>

00:05:14.094 --> 00:05:17.100
<i>It's said that the spell</i>
<i>for transforming base metals</i>

00:05:17.167 --> 00:05:19.906
<i>calls for applying the effects</i>
<i>of the Philosopher's Stone</i>

00:05:19.973 --> 00:05:22.110
<i>to that metal</i>
<i>and that will result</i>

00:05:22.177 --> 00:05:23.413
<i>in precious metals.</i>

00:05:23.714 --> 00:05:25.450
If substance conversion magic

00:05:25.518 --> 00:05:26.854
can be accomplished
somehow without

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.526
the use of any other
arcane processes,

00:05:29.593 --> 00:05:31.997
then it's possible that
the Philosopher's Stone

00:05:32.064 --> 00:05:34.335
is capable
of storing magic sequences.

00:05:34.401 --> 00:05:37.307
Did you say store
magic sequences?

00:05:37.374 --> 00:05:39.546
With flying magic now made real,

00:05:39.613 --> 00:05:42.351
sustainable nuclear fusion
through gravity control

00:05:42.417 --> 00:05:43.921
is now in our sights.

00:05:43.988 --> 00:05:46.392
However, there'd be no point
to that if the magician had

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:48.864
to keep on casting the spells
the entire time.

00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:51.102
Then they'd be no more
than a component

00:05:51.168 --> 00:05:53.172
of the nuclear fusion reactor.

00:05:53.607 --> 00:05:56.145
Living weapons become
machine parts.

[Tatsuya] To activate it,

00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:01.022
the caster is vital,

00:06:01.088 --> 00:06:02.190
although at the same time,

00:06:02.257 --> 00:06:05.130
the system can't be won
that binds the magician.

00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:08.269
I need a way
to stockpile magic sequences

00:06:08.336 --> 00:06:09.405
in the long term.

00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:10.440

00:06:11.643 --> 00:06:13.413

Yes, I do!

00:06:18.356 --> 00:06:20.160

00:06:37.261 --> 00:06:39.365
[Tatsuya] Yes, but only vaguely.

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:41.235

00:06:48.316 --> 00:06:49.886

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.861
will you please do us the honor
of participating

00:06:53.928 --> 00:06:56.399

00:06:56.465 --> 00:06:57.936

00:06:58.002 --> 00:06:59.238

00:06:59.305 --> 00:07:01.275
Well, it's simple.

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.881

but sadly,

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:11.997
Miss Hirakawa
has become indisposed.

00:07:12.064 --> 00:07:14.268
Therefore,
you have been selected

00:07:14.335 --> 00:07:15.838
as her potential replacement.

00:07:17.174 --> 00:07:19.980

00:07:25.056 --> 00:07:27.795
Why choose a first year student,
though?

00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:30.233
I don't see how I could qualify.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:31.837
Aren't all contestants screened

00:07:31.903 --> 00:07:34.141
by the internal thesis
selection committee?

00:07:34.843 --> 00:07:36.580
You were chosen
because presenting

00:07:36.647 --> 00:07:39.418
is a team effort
and you'll be an enormous help.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.859
Miss Ichihara will go into
further detail for you.

00:07:42.925 --> 00:07:44.596
Good day.

00:07:50.574 --> 00:07:53.379
You're here 'cause
I recommended you, Shiba.

00:07:53.446 --> 00:07:56.218
I opposed all the other names
that were brought up.

00:07:56.285 --> 00:07:58.624
But I never even submitted
an application, you know.

00:07:58.691 --> 00:07:59.793
So for you to pick me out

00:07:59.859 --> 00:08:01.395
of the blue seems
rather unwarranted,

00:08:01.462 --> 00:08:02.799
if I'm being honest.

00:08:02.865 --> 00:08:04.903
Surely that decision won't
go over too well with

00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:07.341
the runner up who applied fair
and square, correct?

00:08:07.407 --> 00:08:09.178
Sekimoto just wouldn't cut it!

00:08:09.244 --> 00:08:12.017
He is simply not suited
for this kind of work.

00:08:12.384 --> 00:08:14.355
Hold on.
Sekimoto?

00:08:14.856 --> 00:08:17.127
<i>[Tatsuya] Are you referring</i>

00:08:20.467 --> 00:08:21.636
Listen, Shiba.

00:08:21.703 --> 00:08:23.339
He and I were much too far apart

00:08:23.406 --> 00:08:25.043
on the direction we want
to go.

00:08:25.477 --> 00:08:26.847
In the thesis competition

00:08:26.913 --> 00:08:29.385
there's one primary writer
and then two sub‐writers

00:08:29.451 --> 00:08:31.823
who split the work between them
to type up the thesis

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:33.426
and build out a presentation.

00:08:33.493 --> 00:08:34.696
And this time around,

00:08:34.763 --> 00:08:36.465
it's Miss Ichihara
who's been designated

as our primary writer.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:39.238

The subject
from Miss Ichihara's report

must be right up my alley.
Is that what you're telling me?

The central premise
I've been thinking about

is the feasibility
of a gravity control type

00:08:48.791 --> 00:08:50.928
thermonuclear fusion reactor.

At this point in time,

00:08:53.667 --> 00:08:56.740
we only have three weeks left
till the thesis competition.

00:08:56.807 --> 00:08:58.844
You're the only one
who could handle jumping in

00:08:58.911 --> 00:09:00.180
this late in the game,

00:09:00.246 --> 00:09:02.417
considering that you've already
been researching

00:09:02.484 --> 00:09:03.821
the same topic.

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:08.831
Also, I believe I'm
a great judge of character.

00:09:09.264 --> 00:09:10.300
[scoffs]

00:09:10.366 --> 00:09:11.837
Yes, very well.

00:09:12.304 --> 00:09:13.841
I'm happy to cooperate.

00:09:14.274 --> 00:09:15.410
[Koharu] All right, Shiba.

00:09:15.477 --> 00:09:17.915
Then let me give you
an in‐depth run‐down on how

00:09:17.982 --> 00:09:19.953
the thesis competition works.

00:09:21.489 --> 00:09:22.759
[beeping]

00:09:22.825 --> 00:09:24.896
This academic contest
is a venue

00:09:24.963 --> 00:09:27.067
for high school students
to showcase their knowledge

00:09:27.134 --> 00:09:29.405
of magical theory
and engineering.

00:09:29.939 --> 00:09:32.812
<i>The presentations are entered</i>
<i>into the magic index</i>

00:09:32.879 --> 00:09:34.582
<i>where they're</i>
<i>occasionally accessed</i>

00:09:34.649 --> 00:09:36.987
<i>by universities</i>
<i>and corporations.</i>

00:09:37.053 --> 00:09:39.526
This scholarly event
is held every year

00:09:39.592 --> 00:09:41.763
on the last Sunday of October.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:45.470
The venue alternates
between Kyoto and Yokohama.

00:09:45.538 --> 00:09:48.710
This year it's at Yokohama
International Convention Center.

00:09:48.777 --> 00:09:50.313
Generally speaking,

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.186
we may discuss any subject
that interests the three of us.

00:09:53.252 --> 00:09:55.524
However, we must submit
our final draft

00:09:55.591 --> 00:09:57.127
as well as an outline
of materials

00:09:57.194 --> 00:09:59.566
and sequences used
to the Magic Association

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:00.868
in advance.

00:10:00.935 --> 00:10:02.939
The deadline's two Sundays
from now.

00:10:03.005 --> 00:10:05.544
We'll be submitting everything
to the Kanto branch

00:10:05.611 --> 00:10:07.080
of the Magic Association,

00:10:07.147 --> 00:10:09.051
but it will be through
the school.

00:10:09.118 --> 00:10:11.656
I want to allow extra time
for Mr. Tsuzura

00:10:11.723 --> 00:10:13.326
to review our submission.

00:10:13.392 --> 00:10:15.396
So we should complete
our first draft

00:10:15.463 --> 00:10:16.800
by next Wednesday.

00:10:21.375 --> 00:10:22.444
<i>[Mikihiko] Wait, Tatsuya.</i>

00:10:22.512 --> 00:10:24.849
You've been picked
for the thesis competition team?

00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:26.653
‐ Yes.
‐ Geez, come on.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.822
Seriously?

00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:29.692
You don't sound too excited,
Tatsuya.

00:10:29.759 --> 00:10:31.061
'Cause in his eyes,

00:10:31.128 --> 00:10:33.232
it's just another day
at the office, I guess.

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:35.638
[Mikihiko] Honestly, though,
that's really awesome.

00:10:35.704 --> 00:10:37.842
You know, the winning thesis
from the contest

00:10:37.909 --> 00:10:40.079
is always written up every year
in "Super Nature."

00:10:40.146 --> 00:10:43.186
Actually, it's not uncommon
for second place reports

00:10:43.252 --> 00:10:45.056
to appear in academic journals
as well.

00:10:45.423 --> 00:10:46.893
Wait, hold on a sec.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.097
You don't have a whole lot
of time left to write it, do ya?

00:10:49.164 --> 00:10:51.302
It's due in nine days, roughly,

00:10:51.368 --> 00:10:53.172
and then the school
will send it off.

00:10:53.239 --> 00:10:54.241
Ah, no way!

00:10:54.308 --> 00:10:56.546
You gotta submit the paper
that quickly?

00:10:56.613 --> 00:10:58.049
It seems fine to me.

00:10:58.115 --> 00:11:00.888
If the topic that Miss Ichihara
had chosen to explore

00:11:00.955 --> 00:11:02.825
was something I
was totally unfamiliar with,

00:11:02.892 --> 00:11:04.762
you can bet that I would
have refused her.

00:11:04.996 --> 00:11:07.300
Oh, yeah?
So what are you writing about?

00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:10.039
Technical issues surrounding
a gravity‐controlled‐type

00:11:10.106 --> 00:11:12.512
magic sequence
thermal nuclear fusion reactor

00:11:12.578 --> 00:11:14.181
and their solutions.

00:11:14.248 --> 00:11:15.383
Sounds complex.

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.053
Isn't that one
of the three great puzzles

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.389
of weight‐type magic theory?

00:11:18.456 --> 00:11:20.961
Considering they picked Tatsuya
to join them,

00:11:21.028 --> 00:11:22.798
I just assumed it
was going to be

00:11:22.865 --> 00:11:25.504
a CAD programming‐related
dissertation.

00:11:25.804 --> 00:11:27.909
Yeah, that would have been
my guess also.

00:11:27.975 --> 00:11:30.814
[Erika] Well, Kei Isori is on
the team, too,

00:11:30.881 --> 00:11:32.250
and with a topic like that,

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:34.154
I'm sure you three
can put together something

00:11:34.221 --> 00:11:36.191
that's a slam dunk for victory.

00:11:46.245 --> 00:11:47.214
[exhales]

00:11:47.648 --> 00:11:48.784
[exhales[

00:11:54.394 --> 00:11:55.363
[Sayuri] Welcome home.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.802
I see you two
are as chummy as ever.

00:11:58.369 --> 00:12:01.408
It's been quite a while since
you last paid us a visit,

00:12:01.475 --> 00:12:02.945
Miss Sayuri.

00:12:03.479 --> 00:12:05.350
Yes, I suppose that's true.

00:12:05.416 --> 00:12:08.790
You can't beat the commute,
if you live close to the office.

00:12:08.857 --> 00:12:10.527
Trust me.
I understand.

00:12:10.594 --> 00:12:12.665
Well, I think I'll go
get started on dinner

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:13.834
for us right away.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.704
I'm sure you're as hungry
as I am.

00:12:15.771 --> 00:12:17.307
What would you like
to eat tonight?

00:12:17.808 --> 00:12:19.946
Anything you'd like
to make is fine by me.

00:12:20.013 --> 00:12:22.284
There's no hurry so go
and get changed.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:23.754
[Miyuki] As you wish.

00:12:24.221 --> 00:12:26.091
Do you have any particular
request in mind

00:12:26.158 --> 00:12:27.728
as to my change of attire?

00:12:27.795 --> 00:12:29.264
Please, no need to be shy.

00:12:29.331 --> 00:12:30.366
Whatever it is you want,

00:12:30.433 --> 00:12:32.137
I'd be more than happy
to wear it for you.

00:12:32.505 --> 00:12:34.474
[Tatsuya] Miyuki, you're getting
too carried away.

00:12:34.542 --> 00:12:35.911
[giggles]

00:12:37.515 --> 00:12:38.416
[grunts]
[door closes]

00:12:41.556 --> 00:12:43.259
All right,
you've got something to say,

00:12:43.326 --> 00:12:44.328
so let's hear it.

00:12:44.595 --> 00:12:45.731
I do indeed,

00:12:45.798 --> 00:12:47.167
but you two have made it
quite obvious

00:12:47.233 --> 00:12:48.837
that you both still resent me.

00:12:49.237 --> 00:12:50.941
Miyuki does,
that's true.

00:12:51.442 --> 00:12:54.849
After all, our dad remarried
six months after our mom died.

00:12:54.916 --> 00:12:56.085
Who could blame her
if there's still

00:12:56.151 --> 00:12:57.989
a sense of resentment there
in her heart?

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.428
She may look mature
but she's only 15 years old,

00:13:01.495 --> 00:13:03.065
remember?

00:13:03.466 --> 00:13:04.602
And what about you?

00:13:04.669 --> 00:13:07.808
I'm not capable of feeling
that type of emotion.

00:13:07.875 --> 00:13:09.979
So I'll ask again,
stepmother,

00:13:10.046 --> 00:13:11.850
to what do I owe this pleasure?

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:14.287
Fine.
I can cut to the chase, then.

00:13:14.354 --> 00:13:15.524
I want your help.

00:13:15.591 --> 00:13:18.329
Come back to the head office
at the research lab.

00:13:18.396 --> 00:13:21.068
Drop out of high school as well,
if it's possible.

00:13:21.435 --> 00:13:22.738
That isn't possible.

00:13:23.372 --> 00:13:25.511
As long as Miyuki's attending
First High,

00:13:25.577 --> 00:13:28.049
I, too, must attend
or I can't fulfill my duties

00:13:28.115 --> 00:13:29.852
as my sister's guardian.

00:13:29.919 --> 00:13:32.057
You know as well as I do
that if you hadn't gone

00:13:32.123 --> 00:13:33.627
to high school
then another guardian

00:13:33.694 --> 00:13:34.595
would have been appointed.

00:13:34.662 --> 00:13:35.664
Really?

00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:36.766
Magicians are in short supply

00:13:36.833 --> 00:13:38.169
in every industry.

00:13:38.235 --> 00:13:40.273
Even the Yotsubas would have

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.678
a hard time finding
a replacement.

00:13:43.045 --> 00:13:45.049
Do you truly believe
there's nobody who's

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:46.720
a better bodyguard than you?

00:13:46.786 --> 00:13:50.561
If it's just Miyuki's protection
we're discussing, yes, I do.

00:13:50.627 --> 00:13:51.996
[exhales]

00:13:52.798 --> 00:13:55.436
Simply put, Four Leaves Tech
can't afford to keep such

00:13:55.504 --> 00:13:58.109
a talented staff member like you
on the bench.

00:13:58.175 --> 00:14:01.081
I wouldn't say that I've
been idling on the sidelines.

00:14:01.148 --> 00:14:02.885
Just the other day
I heard you received

00:14:02.952 --> 00:14:04.922
a significant order
for flying devices

00:14:04.989 --> 00:14:07.360
from the USNA's navy,
didn't you?

00:14:07.895 --> 00:14:10.133
[Tatsuya] That alone
should equal 20%

00:14:10.199 --> 00:14:12.003
of your profits
from last quarter.

00:14:12.571 --> 00:14:14.909
[Sayuri] Fair enough,
but at the very least,

00:14:14.976 --> 00:14:15.978
could you come
to the head office

00:14:16.045 --> 00:14:18.416
and help us analyze this sample?

00:14:19.117 --> 00:14:21.523
That's a relic
of the Nino Magatama, correct?

00:14:23.059 --> 00:14:24.529
[Tatsuya] Where
was this unearthed?

00:14:24.662 --> 00:14:25.597
[grunts]

00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:27.902
Understood.

00:14:28.235 --> 00:14:30.239
So the SDF is involved, then.

00:14:30.641 --> 00:14:34.114
You want me to analyze it yet
I suspect the end goal you have

00:14:34.181 --> 00:14:36.986
in mind is to replicate
this Magatama.

00:14:37.287 --> 00:14:38.389
Well, I...

00:14:38.557 --> 00:14:39.692
[exhales]

00:14:40.159 --> 00:14:41.996
Why proceed so recklessly?

00:14:42.898 --> 00:14:44.569
[Tatsuya] Even for o‐parts,

00:14:44.635 --> 00:14:46.873
they're extremely difficult
to synthesize

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.610
through modern technology.

00:14:48.677 --> 00:14:51.115
Our company got this job
at the strong behest

00:14:51.181 --> 00:14:52.317
of the self defense force.

00:14:52.383 --> 00:14:54.354
We can't possibly refuse
their request.

00:14:54.421 --> 00:14:56.860
Even so, the SDF should
be well aware

00:14:56.926 --> 00:14:58.697
it's virtually impossible
to recreate

00:14:58.764 --> 00:14:59.932
out‐of‐place artifacts.

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:01.603
Especially relics.

00:15:02.103 --> 00:15:04.207
Why invest in such a pipe dream?

00:15:06.044 --> 00:15:08.115
I'm told the Nino Magatama
has the ability

00:15:08.182 --> 00:15:09.919
to store magic sequences.

00:15:09.986 --> 00:15:13.058
A bold claim.
Is that a proven fact?

00:15:14.027 --> 00:15:16.131
It's still just hypothetical.

00:15:16.198 --> 00:15:19.171
Although we produced
sufficiently promising data.

00:15:19.237 --> 00:15:20.273
If true,

00:15:20.339 --> 00:15:22.611
then the military
can't ignore that.

00:15:22.678 --> 00:15:24.481
Now it makes sense.

00:15:24.849 --> 00:15:27.955
Still, considering the current
physical state of FLT,

00:15:28.022 --> 00:15:29.458
there can't be any need
to risk taking

00:15:29.525 --> 00:15:31.328
a bullet for someone else,
can there?

00:15:31.395 --> 00:15:33.667
We've already rolled
the dice on this.

00:15:33.733 --> 00:15:35.336
[Tatsuya] Without any chance
of winning?

00:15:36.706 --> 00:15:38.409
We do have a chance.

00:15:38.476 --> 00:15:41.816
With your hidden ability,
we'll be able to analyze it.

00:15:41.883 --> 00:15:43.520
[chuckles]

00:15:43.587 --> 00:15:45.423
Even if we use my magic,

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.728
