[Mari] Wait a second.
I remember now.

00:15:11.856 --> 00:15:14.060
I know exactly what happened
that day.

00:15:14.127 --> 00:15:16.666
Listen, I swear it
was never my intention

00:15:16.733 --> 00:15:17.701
to brush you off,
all right?

00:15:17.768 --> 00:15:19.037
What?

00:15:19.104 --> 00:15:21.308
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but this is what I said.

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:23.312
"With my sword skills,

00:15:23.379 --> 00:15:25.316
I could never hope
to be a match for you."

00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:28.155
"It would be much better for you
if you practice with someone

00:15:28.222 --> 00:15:31.930
who's worthy of you,"
didn't I?

00:15:31.996 --> 00:15:33.700
Huh?
So you mean...

00:15:35.036 --> 00:15:36.338
<i>[Erika] Wait a sec, Mari.</i>

00:15:36.405 --> 00:15:38.543
<i>So you're saying</i>
<i>that you declined</i>

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:40.881
<i>to practice with Mibu</i>
<i>because she was the one</i>

00:15:40.948 --> 00:15:42.183
<i>who's stronger than you?</i>

00:15:42.618 --> 00:15:44.755
<i>[Mari] Well, obviously</i>
<i>if magic were involved,</i>

00:15:44.822 --> 00:15:46.693
my skill set might be superior,

00:15:46.759 --> 00:15:49.264
<i>but Mibu has trained</i>
<i>in pure swordsmanship.</i>

00:15:49.331 --> 00:15:51.468
<i>No way can I beat her</i>
<i>with my sword.</i>

00:15:51.703 --> 00:15:55.744
[Sayaka] Then it was all nothing
<i>more than a misunderstanding?</i>

00:15:55.811 --> 00:15:57.180
[groans]

00:15:59.986 --> 00:16:01.188
<i>[Sayaka] No way.</i>

00:16:01.255 --> 00:16:02.658
<i>[whimpering]</i>

00:16:02.725 --> 00:16:04.461
<i>I'm such an idiot!</i>

00:16:04.529 --> 00:16:07.500
[crying weakly]

00:16:07.868 --> 00:16:12.010
I just assumed,
misunderstanding you like that.

00:16:12.945 --> 00:16:15.316
Always beating myself up
over it.

00:16:15.383 --> 00:16:18.523
Wasting the past year
by resenting your kindness.

00:16:21.028 --> 00:16:22.397
[Tatsuya] I don't think
it was a waste.

00:16:24.367 --> 00:16:25.537
Tatsuya.

00:16:26.004 --> 00:16:27.808
In fact,
this is what Erika said...

00:16:28.309 --> 00:16:29.545
[Tatsuya] After your fight,

00:16:29.612 --> 00:16:31.649
that you had become
so much more powerful

00:16:31.716 --> 00:16:33.285
than in junior high.

00:16:33.954 --> 00:16:36.926
Which is the undeniable result
of the skills you worked

00:16:36.993 --> 00:16:39.464
so hard to polish
with your own two hands.

00:16:39.532 --> 00:16:41.903
Instead of wallowing
in your resentment,

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:43.974
or merely drowning
in your sorrows,

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.777
you kept growing
and improving yourself

00:16:45.844 --> 00:16:48.884
so there's no way this past year
could be considered a waste

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:50.253
of your time,
Miss Mibu.

00:16:50.687 --> 00:16:51.789
Tatsuya.

00:16:51.856 --> 00:16:53.425
[whimpers]

00:16:53.492 --> 00:16:56.666
There's one thing I'd like
to request of you.

00:16:56.733 --> 00:16:58.002
What's that?

00:16:58.068 --> 00:17:01.108
Please just don't move
for a second.

00:17:01.743 --> 00:17:05.016
[Sayaka crying]

00:17:25.757 --> 00:17:27.026
[Tatsuya] Now, then.

00:17:27.661 --> 00:17:30.132
Where are the people
from Blanche right now?

00:17:30.199 --> 00:17:32.036
I'll be needing to know
where I can find them.

00:17:32.103 --> 00:17:33.239
[gasps]

00:17:33.305 --> 00:17:35.176
Tatsuya, don't tell me that‐‐

00:17:35.243 --> 00:17:37.080
you're not taking them on
in battle, are you?

00:17:37.514 --> 00:17:38.984
That's not
an accurate description

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:40.152
of what I'll do.

00:17:40.219 --> 00:17:41.723
I'm going to demolish them.

00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:42.891
It's dangerous.

00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:44.795
That's not for a student to do.

00:17:44.862 --> 00:17:46.131
[Mayumi] I'm against it, too.

00:17:46.198 --> 00:17:47.902
We should leave
non‐school‐related issues

00:17:47.968 --> 00:17:48.837
to law enforcement.

00:17:48.904 --> 00:17:50.339
Okay.

00:17:50.707 --> 00:17:52.310
[Tatsuya] Will you be sending
Miss Mibu to court

00:17:52.377 --> 00:17:53.680
for attempted robbery?

00:17:53.747 --> 00:17:54.682
[both gasping]

00:17:55.349 --> 00:17:56.619
That's a good point.

00:17:56.686 --> 00:17:59.491
Intervention from
the police would be undesirable.

00:17:59.926 --> 00:18:01.428
Even with that being the case,
we students can't let this go.

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.906
But still, Tatsuya,
we're talking terrorists here.

00:18:06.973 --> 00:18:09.679
None of us student
authority figures would dare

00:18:09.745 --> 00:18:12.317
to ask any classmates
to risk their lives.

00:18:12.383 --> 00:18:14.321
I would expect nothing less.

00:18:14.956 --> 00:18:16.592
And it was never my intention

00:18:16.659 --> 00:18:18.630
to ask the student council
for help.

00:18:19.064 --> 00:18:20.968
Are you planning to go alone?

00:18:21.502 --> 00:18:23.072
Normally that
is what I would prefer.

00:18:23.138 --> 00:18:24.274
However‐‐

00:18:24.341 --> 00:18:25.744
‐ I'm going with you.
‐ [exhales]

00:18:26.211 --> 00:18:28.015
‐ And I'll come with!
‐ I will, too.

[gasps]

00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:30.520
No, Tatsuya!

00:18:30.587 --> 00:18:31.990
If you're doing this
for my sake,

00:18:32.056 --> 00:18:34.260
I'm begging you to please stop
and reconsider it.

00:18:34.327 --> 00:18:36.164
I'll be okay.

00:18:36.231 --> 00:18:38.570
I know I deserve punishment
for what I did.

00:18:38.803 --> 00:18:40.106
Don't do this.

00:18:40.172 --> 00:18:42.745
If something were to happen
to you all because of me...

00:18:42.811 --> 00:18:44.849
It's not for your sake,
Miss Mibu.

00:18:45.116 --> 00:18:46.284
[gasps]

00:18:46.351 --> 00:18:47.353
[Tatsuya] It's because
my neighborhood

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.692
has been targeted by terrorists.

00:18:50.694 --> 00:18:51.461
If anyone dares

00:18:51.529 --> 00:18:53.332
to threaten Miyuki's way
of life,

00:18:53.399 --> 00:18:55.202
I'll eradicate them.

00:18:55.269 --> 00:18:56.706
For me personally,

00:18:56.773 --> 00:18:58.643
that's my top priority.

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.681
[gasps]

00:19:00.747 --> 00:19:01.916

00:19:01.983 --> 00:19:03.285
‐ Oh.
‐ Hmm.

00:19:06.258 --> 00:19:07.661
[Miyuki] But hold on, Brother.

00:19:08.028 --> 00:19:09.497
How are all of us going

00:19:09.565 --> 00:19:12.036
to locate Blanche's
secret base headquarters?

00:19:12.103 --> 00:19:13.472
If ever you don't
know something,

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.211
all you need to do
is ask somebody who does.

00:19:22.624 --> 00:19:23.793
Well, I...

[chuckles nervously]

00:19:26.398 --> 00:19:28.603
Why did I ever think
I could remain a detective

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:30.941
by disciple of Master Kokonoe?

00:19:31.008 --> 00:19:32.511
Pretty naive of me, huh?

00:19:38.055 --> 00:19:39.792
<i>[Tatsuya] An abandoned</i>
<i>factory building?</i>

00:19:39.859 --> 00:19:42.130
It would be better
to go by car.

00:19:42.196 --> 00:19:43.666
We're breaking in head on?

00:19:43.733 --> 00:19:45.069
Correct.

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:47.306
[Katsuto] I can get that car
for us.

00:19:47.373 --> 00:19:49.645
Huh?
You're going, too, Jumonji?

00:19:49.712 --> 00:19:52.150
As a proud member of one
of the ten master clans,

00:19:52.216 --> 00:19:53.953
it's obviously my duty
to aid them,

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:55.791
and it goes beyond that.

00:19:55.857 --> 00:19:58.362
As somebody enrolled
at First High School,

00:19:58.429 --> 00:20:00.466
I can't turn a blind eye
to the situation.

00:20:00.534 --> 00:20:02.370
‐ Then I'm‐‐
‐ [Katsuto] Miss Sayagusa.

00:20:02.437 --> 00:20:03.573
You can't go.

[Mari] The student
council president

00:20:04.875 --> 00:20:06.813
can't be away
at a time like this.

00:20:07.948 --> 00:20:09.417
I guess I agree.

00:20:09.852 --> 00:20:11.021
[Mayumi] But if that's the case,
Mari,

00:20:11.088 --> 00:20:12.490
then you can't go, either.

00:20:12.791 --> 00:20:13.793
After all,

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.362
there might still be
some remnants hiding

00:20:15.429 --> 00:20:16.566
on campus grounds,

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:18.135
so the disciplinary chairwoman

00:20:18.202 --> 00:20:19.137
should be here as well.

Please bring me along with you
as well.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.757
Why should I, Kirihara?

00:20:29.324 --> 00:20:32.564
[Takeaki] As a proud student,
I can't let such lawlessness go.

No good.
I can't bring you.

00:20:37.273 --> 00:20:38.475
Not or that reason.

00:20:38.543 --> 00:20:40.212
It's way too flimsy
with lives at stake.

[groans]

00:20:41.849 --> 00:20:43.152
Now tell the truth.

Why should I?

[Takeaki] Chairman.

00:20:49.532 --> 00:20:52.871
In junior high I always
admired Mibu's sword skills.

00:20:52.938 --> 00:20:55.209
<i>Unlike my own,</i>
<i>which were meant to kill...</i>

00:20:55.877 --> 00:20:58.148
<i>Hers were meant</i>
<i>for pure competition.</i>

00:20:58.215 --> 00:21:00.987
<i>Seeing it was beautiful,</i>
<i>and yet,</i>

00:21:01.054 --> 00:21:02.524
somewhere along the line,

00:21:02.591 --> 00:21:04.427
her swordsmanship
became clouded,

00:21:04.494 --> 00:21:06.799
and it gradually weighed upon
my heart and soul.

00:21:06.866 --> 00:21:09.905
Is that why you pulled a stunt
like luring her into that brawl?

00:21:09.972 --> 00:21:12.076
It's not as if I thought
I was helping Mibu

00:21:12.143 --> 00:21:13.746
to see the error of her ways.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.819
I just lost my temper
and I picked a fight with her.

00:21:17.253 --> 00:21:20.459
You say the error of her ways,
but wasn't this Mibu's intent?

00:21:20.527 --> 00:21:21.996
No, it wasn't!

00:21:22.063 --> 00:21:25.169
Mibu's true intentions,
her sword's nothing like that.

00:21:25.704 --> 00:21:27.708
Someone messed with her sword.

00:21:28.108 --> 00:21:29.344
Someone corrupted her.

00:21:29.845 --> 00:21:32.049
Some son
of a bitch used Miss Mibu

00:21:32.116 --> 00:21:33.520
in today's incident.

00:21:33.586 --> 00:21:35.857
This isn't even about her,
really.

00:21:35.924 --> 00:21:37.493
I'm just so angry!

00:21:38.095 --> 00:21:39.030

00:21:39.097 --> 00:21:40.567

Jumonji,
please let me come with you!

[shudders]

00:21:56.331 --> 00:21:57.634

Are you sure?

Yes, you've now given me
a good enough reason.
