the CAD's basic system.

That's why it's

Meaning that you've got

But sadly,
I'm not there yet.

the psions at the moment
of extension and impact.

is a technique categorized

under secret skills
or the arcane arts,

00:05:29.693 --> 00:05:32.866
but it's way more than a matter
of having tons of psions.

00:05:32.932 --> 00:05:36.305
Maybe the more likely truth
of it is that regular civilians

00:08:13.687 --> 00:08:14.956
both: Huh?

00:08:15.558 --> 00:08:18.096
‐ Hmm?
‐ Uh, never mind.

00:08:18.964 --> 00:08:20.233
[whimpers]

00:08:21.035 --> 00:08:23.039
<i>[Miyuki] It's nothing.</i>
<i>Forget it.</i>

00:08:24.008 --> 00:08:25.778
[Mayumi] Why don't we get down
to business, then?

00:08:27.648 --> 00:08:29.451
At this school
the student council president

00:08:29.519 --> 00:08:30.788
is duly elected,

00:08:30.855 --> 00:08:33.560
but all of the other officers
are either chosen

00:08:33.627 --> 00:08:35.631
or dismissed
by the president alone.

00:08:35.698 --> 00:08:36.933
With few exceptions,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.937
the president also has
the power to appoint

00:08:39.004 --> 00:08:40.941
or release the chairman
of each committee.

00:08:41.008 --> 00:08:42.845
One such exception,
for example,

00:08:42.912 --> 00:08:44.916
would be my own
disciplinary committee.

00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:47.688
We appoint one officer each
to the student council,

00:08:47.755 --> 00:08:49.893
the extracurricular
activities federations,

00:08:49.959 --> 00:08:51.228
and the faculty committee,

00:08:51.295 --> 00:08:54.134
but the chairman is chosen
by an internal election.

00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:55.504
Hmm.

00:08:56.005 --> 00:08:59.779
Now, in keeping with our
school's annual tradition,

00:08:59.846 --> 00:09:01.850
it is now our pleasure
to appoint

00:09:01.917 --> 00:09:04.723
the first year representative
to the student council.

00:09:05.356 --> 00:09:09.098
Miyuki, I'd like you to be
the one who fulfills

00:09:09.164 --> 00:09:10.935
that esteemed role.

00:09:11.302 --> 00:09:12.872
Will you accept the appointment?

00:09:15.276 --> 00:09:16.278
[groans]

00:09:17.214 --> 00:09:18.249
[grunts]

00:09:19.485 --> 00:09:20.621
[grunts]

00:09:22.224 --> 00:09:23.226
Madam President,

00:09:23.292 --> 00:09:25.497
do you know about
my brother's exam scores?

00:09:25.564 --> 00:09:26.767
[gasps]

00:09:27.568 --> 00:09:30.373
If the council wants to recruit
a qualified individual,

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.346
I believe my brother
is a far better choice than me.

00:09:34.014 --> 00:09:35.851
That the student council's
asking me

00:09:35.918 --> 00:09:38.189
to join their impressive ranks
honors me very deeply.

00:09:38.256 --> 00:09:39.526
Uh, hey, Miyuki.

00:09:39.592 --> 00:09:42.431
It would be my distinct pleasure
to join you at the foot

00:09:42.497 --> 00:09:44.234
of your table,
honestly,

00:09:44.301 --> 00:09:46.506
but is there any way that you
could bring my brother

00:09:46.573 --> 00:09:47.875
on board as well?

00:09:50.013 --> 00:09:52.451
‐ [all groaning]
‐ Unfortunately,

00:09:52.518 --> 00:09:54.121
that won't be possible.

00:09:54.188 --> 00:09:56.459
Officers of the student council
are chosen

00:09:56.526 --> 00:09:58.496
from among course one students.

00:09:58.564 --> 00:10:00.801
This is a respected precedent.

00:10:01.402 --> 00:10:02.738
[Suzune] To overturn this rule,

00:10:02.805 --> 00:10:04.776
the entire student body
would have to vote

00:10:04.843 --> 00:10:07.147
for an overhaul
of the system at large.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.621
[gasps]

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:13.459
My sincere apologies, then.

00:10:13.527 --> 00:10:16.700
Please forgive me for being
so forward and so out of line.

00:10:17.869 --> 00:10:19.706
Let's see here.

00:10:19.772 --> 00:10:21.475
So are we agreed
that you'll officially

00:10:21.543 --> 00:10:23.246
be joining us and coming
on board

00:10:23.312 --> 00:10:26.252
as our new student council
secretary this semester, Miyuki?

00:10:27.154 --> 00:10:28.122
[grunts]

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:31.830
[Miyuki] Yes.

00:10:31.897 --> 00:10:34.134
I'll do everything in my power
to serve you well,

00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:36.238
so please allow me to join you.

00:10:36.305 --> 00:10:37.407
[giggles]

00:10:37.474 --> 00:10:39.546
Ah‐chan will better explain
the particulars

00:10:39.612 --> 00:10:41.148
of your new duties.
Understood?

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:42.685
[Mari] Can I jump in here?

00:10:42.752 --> 00:10:44.087
all: Huh?

00:10:44.421 --> 00:10:47.060
[Mari] There is one position
the disciplinary committee left

00:10:47.127 --> 00:10:48.831
by a graduate that has yet
to be filled

00:10:48.897 --> 00:10:50.133
by the student council.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.636
Yes,
but we're still going through

00:10:51.703 --> 00:10:53.674
the selection process.
I told you.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.243
If I'm not mistaken,

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.949
selecting a course two student
as a student council nominee

00:10:58.015 --> 00:11:00.053
wouldn't violate any rules.
‐ [grunts]

00:11:01.455 --> 00:11:02.592
Isn't that true?

00:11:03.125 --> 00:11:04.796
‐ Great call!
‐ Huh?

00:11:05.163 --> 00:11:06.232
[Mayumi] For
the disciplinary committee,

00:11:06.298 --> 00:11:07.334
it's no problem!

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.906
The council hereby nominates
Tatsuya Shiba

00:11:09.973 --> 00:11:11.877
to the disciplinary committee!

00:11:12.377 --> 00:11:13.881
Hold on a second, please.

00:11:13.947 --> 00:11:15.684
Do I have any say
in this decision?

00:11:15.751 --> 00:11:17.187
I mean,
in the first place,

00:11:17.254 --> 00:11:19.993
you haven't even explained to me
what this committee even does.

00:11:20.059 --> 00:11:22.965
Well, your sister'll have duties
on student council

00:11:23.032 --> 00:11:25.403
but we haven't told her what
those are yet, either.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.276
Well, yeah, that's true, but‐‐

00:11:28.342 --> 00:11:31.448
It'll be all right, Rin.
Just take it easy.

00:11:32.217 --> 00:11:35.356
Tatsuya, the disciplinary
committee maintains order

00:11:35.423 --> 00:11:36.392
at this school.

00:11:39.599 --> 00:11:41.101
[Tatsuya] Is that all they do?

00:11:41.168 --> 00:11:42.170
Pardon?

00:11:45.243 --> 00:11:46.680
[gasps]

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.888
Well, um, there main duties
are to charge those in violation

00:11:50.955 --> 00:11:52.190
of the school
regulations regarding

00:11:52.257 --> 00:11:53.994
the use of magic
and to crack down

00:11:54.061 --> 00:11:56.198
on disorderly conduct involving
the same.

00:11:57.467 --> 00:12:00.206
Just in case,
I'd like to confirm one thing.

00:12:00.273 --> 00:12:01.676
Yes, what?

00:12:02.077 --> 00:12:03.780
[Tatsuya] If I
understand correctly,

00:12:03.847 --> 00:12:05.350
whenever a fight breaks out,

00:12:05.416 --> 00:12:07.888
the disciplinary committee has
to stop it by force.

00:12:07.955 --> 00:12:09.057
Is that right?

00:12:09.792 --> 00:12:11.195
Well, more or less.

00:12:11.262 --> 00:12:13.900
So then does that hold true
if any magic

00:12:13.967 --> 00:12:15.504
is being used whatsoever?

00:12:15.571 --> 00:12:19.044
Ideally, we'd manage to stop it
before they used any magic.

00:12:19.111 --> 00:12:23.019
Sorry, but I'm course two
because my practical exam scores

00:12:23.085 --> 00:12:24.454
were miserable.
‐ [Mari] That's fine.

00:12:24.522 --> 00:12:25.524
[grunts]

00:12:25.591 --> 00:12:26.793
We have me to deal

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.129
with tests of strength.

00:12:29.064 --> 00:12:30.834
[school bell chimes]
[gasps]

00:12:30.901 --> 00:12:32.972
Right, let's pick this up again
after school.

00:12:33.039 --> 00:12:34.341
[Mari] That okay with you?

00:12:34.909 --> 00:12:36.011
[exhales sharply]

00:12:36.913 --> 00:12:38.249
[Tatsuya] Fine by me.

[Leonhard]
Disciplinary committee?

00:12:57.153 --> 00:12:59.257
Yeah.
So anyway,

00:12:59.324 --> 00:13:01.997
I've gotta go discuss it
with them again after school.

00:13:02.063 --> 00:13:04.836
Well that sounds like
a giant pain in the ass.

00:13:04.902 --> 00:13:06.740
Isn't what
the disciplinary committee does

00:13:06.806 --> 00:13:08.175
kind of dangerous?

00:13:08.242 --> 00:13:10.748
Wow
She does what she wants.

Disciplinary committee

to watch and learn from there.

It's Gyobu Hattori!

[Mari] But that's
a government post,

00:15:26.485 --> 00:15:28.122
not a name.
Isn't your family‐‐

00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:29.959
[Gyobu] We no longer hold
that office.

00:15:30.026 --> 00:15:32.397
At this school I'm registered
as Gyobu Hatto‐‐

00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:34.468
Wait, that's not the point.

00:15:34.836 --> 00:15:35.904
What's your problem?

[grunts]

00:15:38.275 --> 00:15:39.779
[Gyobu] I disapprove
of this first year

00:15:39.846 --> 00:15:41.816
being appointed
to the disciplinary committee.

00:15:41.883 --> 00:15:46.325
No Weed has ever been assigned
that specific position.

00:15:46.826 --> 00:15:48.930
[Mari] It is forbidden to refer
to course two students

00:15:48.997 --> 00:15:49.999
as Weeds.

00:15:50.066 --> 00:15:51.135
You have some nerve to utter

but it does no good.

Be honest.

00:15:56.613 --> 00:15:58.315
Do you intend to bust over
a third

00:15:58.382 --> 00:16:00.219
of the entire student body
for it?

00:16:00.621 --> 00:16:02.958
This committee's job
is to crack down on students

00:16:03.025 --> 00:16:05.731
in clear violation of the rules
using practical skills.

00:16:05.797 --> 00:16:08.235
[Gyobu] A Weed couldn't hack it.
They're too inferior.

Yes, our system is merit‐based,

but practical skills come
in many forms.

00:16:13.914 --> 00:16:15.617
Tatsuya has the eyesight
and brains

00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:17.555
to read activation
sequences directly,

00:16:17.621 --> 00:16:19.559

which spell's about

there's no way.

You're right, which is precisely

I want him on my committee.

You see,
just as you keep on saying,

00:16:51.689 --> 00:16:54.595
there's an emotional chasm
between course one and two.

[Mari] The course one
students insist

00:16:56.733 --> 00:16:59.539
on policing course two,
but it's never the opposite.

This has only deepened the rift
with no end in sight,

00:17:03.112 --> 00:17:04.949

that my brother's practical
test scores were sub par,

his skills were incompatible

Because we have the power
