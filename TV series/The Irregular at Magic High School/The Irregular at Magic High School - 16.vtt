[Katsuto] Saegusa, calm down.

00:14:54.387 --> 00:14:57.260
Among the ancient martial arts,
which Shiba's trained in,

00:14:57.327 --> 00:15:00.299
lies the mystical ability
to fortify the body.

00:15:19.539 --> 00:15:21.308
[Kousuke] It just never
gets old.

00:15:21.375 --> 00:15:23.680
The swiftness
of his self restoration.

00:15:23.747 --> 00:15:26.586
It's beyond us human's
natural cognitive speed.

00:15:26.653 --> 00:15:27.855
[groans]

00:15:27.922 --> 00:15:30.928
Aww, I'm joking.
Don't give me that look.

00:15:31.295 --> 00:15:33.633
I've never seen
Tatsuya Shiba use

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.103
the self restoration spell.

00:15:35.169 --> 00:15:37.006
He's not even supposed
to be able to use that.

00:15:37.073 --> 00:15:38.910
It's clearly beyond his ability.

00:15:39.344 --> 00:15:42.083
Yes indeed.
His resilience is otherworldly.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:45.591
That young man,
he's really something else.

00:15:45.824 --> 00:15:48.530
It doesn't give you the right
to conduct experiments

00:15:48.597 --> 00:15:51.135
on Shiba like he's some sort
of a lowly lab rat.

00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:54.107
On the contrary,
he's a valuable asset.

00:15:54.474 --> 00:15:57.480
One of only two in the country
and one of a rumored 50 or so

00:15:57.548 --> 00:15:59.317
in the whole world, after all.
‐ Hmm.

00:15:59.685 --> 00:16:02.157
Well, I doubt he's such
a weakling that he'd fall apart

00:16:02.223 --> 00:16:04.427
after a few
scientific experiments.

00:16:04.896 --> 00:16:05.931
Come on.

00:16:05.998 --> 00:16:06.900
It's not a matter of whether

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:08.169
he'd fall apart or not.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:10.173
[Kousuke] Be that as it may,

00:16:10.239 --> 00:16:12.243
it's exactly like
you said earlier.

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:14.715
Tatsuya deployed the spell,
didn't he?

00:16:14.782 --> 00:16:16.351
[Kyouko] Yes.
As expected,

00:16:16.418 --> 00:16:18.289
engaging an opponent
like Ichijou

00:16:18.355 --> 00:16:21.596
with such a low spec CAD
was too tall a task.

00:16:21.663 --> 00:16:25.169
I can't say I would blame him
for using Flash Cast.

00:16:26.238 --> 00:16:27.741
[Kousuke] Did you say
Flash Cast?

00:16:28.777 --> 00:16:31.081
Instead of using a CAD,

00:16:31.148 --> 00:16:33.587
the magician calls up
the activation sequence

00:16:33.653 --> 00:16:34.956
from memory.

00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:37.628
The speed of the technique
is a big threat.

00:16:37.695 --> 00:16:39.665
[Kyouko] Particularly
in his case.

00:16:39.732 --> 00:16:42.638
That capability
to store magic sequences

00:16:42.705 --> 00:16:46.311
within his memory as images
allows him to bypass.

00:16:46.378 --> 00:16:48.249
He can completely skip
the process

00:16:48.315 --> 00:16:50.253
for building magic sequences.

00:16:50.319 --> 00:16:51.455
[Kousuke] What do you think?

00:16:51.523 --> 00:16:53.593
Is there anyone in our squad
who can activate

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:56.498
that sequence faster
than Shiba just did?

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.505
I would venture that Yanagi
who commands the same set

00:16:59.572 --> 00:17:02.443
of skills is the only one
who can hope to equal him.

so I couldn't move out
of the way

00:20:08.248 --> 00:20:09.885
and I just stood my ground.

00:20:09.952 --> 00:20:11.054
Bam!
I got hit.

00:20:11.121 --> 00:20:13.526
There's no way I was getting out
of that unscathed.

00:20:13.593 --> 00:20:15.797
In fact,
I cracked three ribs that day.

00:20:15.864 --> 00:20:17.433
Today wasn't that bad.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.872
In fact it was a total breeze
by comparison.

00:20:19.939 --> 00:20:21.843
[groans]
Uh, Leo,

00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:25.851
may I ask you a quick question,
just to clarify something?

00:20:25.917 --> 00:20:28.623
All of the Cardinal's
compressed air bullets,

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:31.228
did you block them
with fortifying magic?

00:20:31.294 --> 00:20:33.499
[laughs]
Actually, it's embarrassing,

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:35.837
but I was so focused
on attacking,

00:20:35.904 --> 00:20:39.177
as you may guess,
I had no defenses at the time.

00:20:39.244 --> 00:20:40.947
It's so embarrassing.

00:20:41.014 --> 00:20:42.818
[grunts]
Wait a second.

00:20:42.885 --> 00:20:45.690
Are you saying you were able
to withstand Ichijou's

00:20:45.757 --> 00:20:47.528
attack magic
with your body alone?

00:20:47.594 --> 00:20:49.598
Yeah, but it was too much
for me,

00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:51.301
and that's why
it took me so long

00:20:51.368 --> 00:20:53.305
to stand back up again.

00:20:53.372 --> 00:20:55.142
Hmm?
Hold on a sec.

00:20:55.209 --> 00:20:57.046
Your lip is bleeding,
Mikihiko.

00:20:57.548 --> 00:20:59.250
‐ Are you all right?
‐ What?

00:20:59.317 --> 00:21:00.286
Yeah.

00:21:00.352 --> 00:21:03.025
I'm totally a‐okay.

00:21:03.091 --> 00:21:05.429
[Leonhard] Come to think of it,
how are you, Tatsuya?

00:21:05.496 --> 00:21:08.001
Huh?
I'm sorry?

00:21:08.068 --> 00:21:09.304
Could you say that again?

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:10.574
Uh...

00:21:11.007 --> 00:21:13.780
I was wondering
if you're feeling okay, Tatsuya.

00:21:13.847 --> 00:21:14.982
[Tatsuya] Yeah.

00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:17.921
I've got a ruptured ear drum
on one side,

00:21:17.988 --> 00:21:20.359
so I can't hear
very well right now.

00:21:20.426 --> 00:21:22.263
Anyway, Mikihiko‐‐

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:23.365
‐ [gasps]
‐ [Tatsuya] What's wrong?

00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:25.770
Seriously, you're starting
to freak me out.

00:21:25.837 --> 00:21:27.440
You look like you've just seen
a ghost.

00:21:27.508 --> 00:21:29.277
[gasps]
It's not that.

00:21:29.344 --> 00:21:30.714
You really can't hear us?

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:32.851
So you couldn't understand
what we were saying?

00:21:32.918 --> 00:21:35.356
You don't know what we've
been talking about, then?

00:21:35.422 --> 00:21:36.826
Afraid not.

00:21:36.893 --> 00:21:39.297
Right now I'm only
getting by because

00:21:39.364 --> 00:21:41.401
of my ability to read your lips.

00:21:41.969 --> 00:21:44.040
[Tatsuya] Well, I did manage
to hear the part where

00:21:44.107 --> 00:21:47.514
I think Leo said he had been hit
by someone's motorcycle.

00:21:48.015 --> 00:21:49.117
[gasps]

00:21:49.184 --> 00:21:50.987
That didn't raise any questions

00:21:51.054 --> 00:21:52.423
inside your mind, then?

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:54.829
Questions?
About what?

00:21:54.895 --> 00:21:55.931
Uh...

00:21:55.997 --> 00:21:56.966
[Leonhard] Hey, Mikihiko.

00:21:57.033 --> 00:21:58.903
What the heck's
the matter with you?

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.509
Why'd you get so gloomy all
of a sudden?

00:22:01.576 --> 00:22:03.445
[scoffs]
Come on!

00:22:03.513 --> 00:22:06.251
Victory is ours!
We're winners, Mikihiko!

00:22:06.318 --> 00:22:07.654
[scoffs]

00:22:08.121 --> 00:22:09.324
[groans]

00:22:09.959 --> 00:22:11.461
That's true.

00:22:13.298 --> 00:22:16.371
[cheers and applause]

00:22:18.843 --> 00:22:20.412
[gasps]

00:22:20.479 --> 00:22:21.616
[chuckles]

00:22:24.254 --> 00:22:25.690
[gasping]

00:22:26.424 --> 00:22:27.761
Brother!
