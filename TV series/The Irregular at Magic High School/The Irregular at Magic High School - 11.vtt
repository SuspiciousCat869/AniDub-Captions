00:07:37.214 --> 00:07:39.051
[all cheering]

00:07:39.118 --> 00:07:40.588
[grunts]

00:07:40.955 --> 00:07:41.757
[all shouting]

00:07:41.823 --> 00:07:43.560
[Erika] A self‐destruct spell?

00:07:43.627 --> 00:07:44.829
[Tatsuya] Most likely she tried
to throw off

00:07:44.896 --> 00:07:47.467
the other contestants
by creating a huge wave.

00:07:47.535 --> 00:07:49.004
Hey, they're catching up to her!

00:07:50.307 --> 00:07:52.712
[whirring]

00:07:54.983 --> 00:07:57.287
So she's applying
fortification magic

00:07:57.354 --> 00:07:58.857
while also casting movement?

00:07:59.224 --> 00:08:02.264
Fortifying magic?
But what is she strengthening?

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:04.769
[Tatsuya] She's anchoring
her relative position

00:08:04.836 --> 00:08:07.007
to her board to keep
from falling off.

00:08:07.441 --> 00:08:09.044
‐ [Leonhard] Hmm?
‐ Put another way,

00:08:09.111 --> 00:08:11.850
fortification doesn't strengthen
a substance.

00:08:11.917 --> 00:08:14.889
It anchors components relative
to each other.

00:08:14.956 --> 00:08:17.060
Surely you understand that.

00:08:17.127 --> 00:08:19.666
Of course,
considering I use it myself.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.803
[Tatsuya] Miss Watanabe
made herself

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:25.143
and her board a single object
comprising one component.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.049
The spell anchors
its relative position.

00:08:28.884 --> 00:08:31.422
She's casting movement magic
on herself and the board

00:08:31.489 --> 00:08:32.792
as a single entity.

00:08:32.859 --> 00:08:34.428
[Leonhard] How creative!

00:08:34.495 --> 00:08:35.664
[Tatsuya] Yes.

00:08:35.731 --> 00:08:37.267
It's quite
an interesting application.

00:08:38.336 --> 00:08:40.608
She's also using
vibration magic?

00:08:40.674 --> 00:08:42.210
That's impressive.

00:08:42.277 --> 00:08:44.448
She's multi‐casting three
to four different types

00:08:44.516 --> 00:08:45.785
of spells continuously.

00:08:50.393 --> 00:08:51.563
[all screaming]

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.903
[grunts]

00:08:55.437 --> 00:08:56.907
She's quite the strategist.

00:08:56.973 --> 00:08:59.144
No, she just really hates
to lose.

00:08:59.746 --> 00:09:01.282
[Leonhard] Well,
it looks like she won't.

00:09:01.348 --> 00:09:02.250
[Tatsuya] Yep.

00:09:05.423 --> 00:09:07.662
[cicadas chirping]

00:09:09.866 --> 00:09:12.471
Excuse me, Major Kazama,
but you have a guest.

00:09:12.939 --> 00:09:14.007
<i>[Harunobu] Come in.</i>

00:09:15.911 --> 00:09:17.347
Reporting for duty.

00:09:17.815 --> 00:09:19.351
[Harunobu] Welcome.

00:09:19.719 --> 00:09:21.021
Please, have a seat.

00:09:21.088 --> 00:09:23.827
No, thanks.
I'll be fine right here.

00:09:24.194 --> 00:09:25.430
At ease, Tatsuya.

00:09:25.497 --> 00:09:28.871
We didn't call you here today
as special officer

00:09:28.937 --> 00:09:32.277
and the strategic class magician
Ryuuya Ooguro.

00:09:32.344 --> 00:09:33.747
When we invited you here,

00:09:33.814 --> 00:09:36.252
it was as our personal friend
Tatsuya Shiba.

00:09:36.853 --> 00:09:38.891
[Shigeru] If you stand there
before us formally,

00:09:38.957 --> 00:09:40.460
we won't know what to do.

00:09:40.528 --> 00:09:42.230
Ah, my apologies.

00:09:42.865 --> 00:09:45.203
Captain Sanada,
forgive me.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.221
[Kyouko] These tea cups don't
quite capture the spirit...

00:09:55.356 --> 00:09:56.760
But how about a toast?

00:09:58.095 --> 00:09:59.866
[Harunobu]
About last night's incident.

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:01.870
There's no question
those intruders

00:10:01.937 --> 00:10:04.576
were with the No Head Dragons
I told you about.

00:10:04.943 --> 00:10:07.515
[Tatsuya] Are they targeting
the NSC as suspected?

00:10:07.582 --> 00:10:09.552
That's still being investigated.

00:10:10.086 --> 00:10:11.823
[Harunobu] You'll be kept
in the loop.

00:10:12.424 --> 00:10:13.660
Much appreciated.

00:10:13.727 --> 00:10:14.963
[Kyouko] Still, I'm amazed
that you happened

00:10:15.029 --> 00:10:16.600
to be right there
on the spot.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.937
Were you on the lookout
for something?

00:10:19.004 --> 00:10:21.543
I was taking a stroll
and that's when I happened

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:22.945
to sense their presence.

00:10:23.012 --> 00:10:25.450
You went for a walk
at such a late hour?

00:10:25.951 --> 00:10:29.057
Well, I'd been out fine‐tuning
our CADs for the matches.

00:10:29.692 --> 00:10:30.895
[Kousuke] Oh, that reminds me.

00:10:30.961 --> 00:10:33.567
Do your teammates know
about silver?

00:10:33.934 --> 00:10:35.871
[Tatsuya] No, Major Yamanaka,

00:10:35.938 --> 00:10:38.209
since that is,
after all, confidential.

00:10:38.276 --> 00:10:40.113
[Kyouko] Are you competing
in any events?

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.683
You know,
with your impressive

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:42.885
Flash Casts skills,

00:10:42.952 --> 00:10:44.789
I bet that you'd do pretty well.

00:10:44.856 --> 00:10:47.127
Material Burst
is too destructive,

00:10:47.194 --> 00:10:49.532
although you could always use
Mist Dispersion.

00:10:49.933 --> 00:10:52.137
Releasing substances
at the molecular level

00:10:52.204 --> 00:10:55.578
as one does with Mist Dispersion
is a Rank A destructive spell

00:10:55.644 --> 00:10:57.615
so Tatsuya can't use it
at the NSC.

00:10:57.682 --> 00:10:59.686
Wait, what's this,
Major Sanada?

00:10:59.752 --> 00:11:01.590
I think
you've overlooked something.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.027
<i>[Kyouko] NCS restrictions</i>
<i>are placed upon events</i>

00:11:04.094 --> 00:11:06.533
that might have
personnel‐related repercussions,

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.570
<i>but Speed Shooting</i>
<i>and Ice Pillars Break</i>

00:11:08.637 --> 00:11:10.006
<i>are both exempt from them.</i>

00:11:11.676 --> 00:11:12.945
Even if that's so,

00:11:13.012 --> 00:11:15.216
casting top secret
military‐grade magic

00:11:15.283 --> 00:11:17.387
in a public tournament isn't
a great idea,

00:11:17.454 --> 00:11:18.489
now is it?

00:11:18.891 --> 00:11:20.026
Am I right?

00:11:20.861 --> 00:11:22.532
[Tatsuya] I understand, Major.

00:11:22.732 --> 00:11:24.134
Anyway,

00:11:24.201 --> 00:11:26.673
it seems extremely unlikely
that an engineer such

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.442
as myself would end up
as a competitor.

00:11:29.779 --> 00:11:31.750
Unlikely,
but not impossible.

00:11:34.154 --> 00:11:36.158
[Harunobu]
Are we on the same page?

00:11:36.225 --> 00:11:38.195
<i>[Erika] Tatsuya,</i>
<i>we're over here!</i>

00:11:38.262 --> 00:11:39.498
<i>Come on!</i>

00:11:39.566 --> 00:11:41.302
Hey!
[gasps]

00:11:41.937 --> 00:11:44.374
This is a big crowd
for only quarter finals.

00:11:44.441 --> 00:11:46.412
'Cause the chairwoman
is competing.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.284
[Mizuki] The other matches
are nowhere near this packed.

00:11:50.186 --> 00:11:51.255
‐ [Tatsuya] Honoka.
‐ Hmm?

00:11:51.322 --> 00:11:52.692
[Tatsuya] Are you sure
you can see?

00:11:52.758 --> 00:11:54.328
I'm fine, Tatsuya.
Thanks.

00:11:54.394 --> 00:11:55.296
[Tatsuya] That's good.

00:11:55.363 --> 00:11:57.802
By the way, Erika,
where's Mikihiko?

00:11:57.868 --> 00:12:00.106
He told us he's feeling under
the weather.

00:12:00.173 --> 00:12:02.244
He said that he'd be resting
in his room.

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:05.016
Well, I guess the heat must
have really gotten to him.

00:12:05.083 --> 00:12:07.187
If I hadn't been wearing
my glasses earlier,

00:12:07.254 --> 00:12:08.957
I may very well have collapsed,
too.

00:12:09.024 --> 00:12:10.293
[audience cheering]
[gasps]

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:25.791
[beeping]

00:12:27.862 --> 00:12:29.197
[lasers firing]

00:12:34.709 --> 00:12:36.245
Extraordinary.

00:12:36.312 --> 00:12:39.017
Wow, that's Miss Saegusa's
Der Freischutz technique.

00:12:39.484 --> 00:12:41.288
And it's even faster
than last year.

00:12:41.355 --> 00:12:42.324
[banging]

00:12:54.281 --> 00:12:56.620
[buzzing]

00:12:56.686 --> 00:12:58.957
[crowd cheering]

00:13:12.518 --> 00:13:13.854
[all] Cheers!

00:13:14.956 --> 00:13:16.425
Chairwoman,

00:13:16.492 --> 00:13:19.464
congratulations on winning
your speed shooting event today!

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:21.168
Thank you very much.

00:13:21.435 --> 00:13:22.605
Don't forget Mari.

00:13:22.672 --> 00:13:25.043
She's going
to the Battle Board semifinals.

00:13:25.109 --> 00:13:27.147
For now it's all going
as expected.

00:13:27.213 --> 00:13:28.684
[Mayumi]
And First High School won

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.688
the Speed Shooting event
for boys as well.

00:13:30.754 --> 00:13:33.225
<i>[Mari] Battle Board</i>
<i>was something of a nail‐biter,</i>

00:13:33.292 --> 00:13:35.898
<i>but Hattori sure did manage</i>
<i>to pull that out in the end.</i>

00:13:35.964 --> 00:13:37.267
<i>[Azusa] Maybe the adjustments</i>

00:13:37.334 --> 00:13:39.271
<i>to his CAD weren't working</i>
<i>for him.</i>

00:13:39.338 --> 00:13:41.876
Well, I heard that he's
been tweaking it all day

00:13:41.943 --> 00:13:44.114
with Kenoshita
from the technical staff.

00:13:44.515 --> 00:13:47.253
Fortunately Hanzou
has the whole day off tomorrow.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.191
I suppose we'll just have
to let him adjust it

00:13:49.257 --> 00:13:50.661
to his heart's content.

00:13:51.295 --> 00:13:54.000
Although, I think
that Kinoshita's busy with

00:13:54.067 --> 00:13:55.671
the girls'
Crowd Ball event tomorrow.

00:13:55.738 --> 00:13:58.242
That's correct,
but he's only a sub‐engineer,

00:13:58.309 --> 00:14:00.681
so losing him for that won't be
a big problem.

00:14:00.748 --> 00:14:04.154
Leaving it all to Izumi would be
a big risk to take, though.

00:14:04.221 --> 00:14:05.824
[Suzune] Then how 'bout
asking Shiba

00:14:05.891 --> 00:14:07.728
to fill in since he's off
both tomorrow

00:14:07.795 --> 00:14:09.231
and the day after?
‐ [grunts]

00:14:09.297 --> 00:14:10.266
[exhales]

00:14:10.333 --> 00:14:12.237
I guess that's our best bet,
huh?

00:14:12.671 --> 00:14:13.740
All right.
Well, Miyuki?

00:14:13.807 --> 00:14:14.642
‐ [gasps]
‐ [Mayumi] Will you please

00:14:14.709 --> 00:14:15.844
let Tatsuya know?

00:14:16.813 --> 00:14:18.249
Sure.

00:14:19.786 --> 00:14:20.988
I see.

00:14:21.055 --> 00:14:22.323
[Tatsuya] That's why you
came here so late?

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:23.492
[gasps]

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.463
Did I show up
at a bad time?

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:26.498
[gasps]

00:14:26.566 --> 00:14:27.735
No, it's fine.

00:14:28.302 --> 00:14:29.972
<i>[Tatsuya] I appreciate you</i>
<i>giving me the message,</i>

00:14:30.039 --> 00:14:30.974
<i>but hotel or not,</i>

00:14:31.041 --> 00:14:32.277
<i>a young girl shouldn't</i>

00:14:32.343 --> 00:14:33.914
<i>be wandering around</i>
<i>at this hour.</i>

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.218
[gasps]
Yes.

00:14:36.285 --> 00:14:38.089
Sorry for putting myself
in harm's way.

00:14:38.155 --> 00:14:39.692
I truly am, brother.

00:14:40.193 --> 00:14:41.963
Apologizing with that smile
on your face?

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:44.736
Nice try.
Never mind.

00:14:44.802 --> 00:14:46.105
[Tatsuya] Thanks
for letting me know.

00:14:46.873 --> 00:14:48.109
I'll walk you back.

00:14:48.476 --> 00:14:50.881
Oh, no, please.
That's not necessary.

00:14:50.948 --> 00:14:53.486
I can't trouble you more
than this, honestly.

00:14:53.553 --> 00:14:55.657
Admittedly you caught me
in the middle of something,

00:14:55.724 --> 00:14:58.295
but I'm just fiddling around,
so don't worry about it.

00:14:58.362 --> 00:14:59.532
You sure?

00:15:00.032 --> 00:15:02.605
Isn't that a CAD program
on your computer?

00:15:03.305 --> 00:15:05.511
[Tatsuya] It's nothing to do
with the NSC.

00:15:06.078 --> 00:15:08.917
Plus, the program itself
is pretty much a toy.
