ROOT HEAD: By the power
of the Tree of Ages,

00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:12.233
I return to this world!

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.233
‐ [yelps]
‐ What's happening?!

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.233
[all yell]

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.233
[wind blowing]

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.466
‐ What's going on?

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.633
‐ I don't like it.

00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.633
‐ I know this smell. [gasps]

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:27.733
Mei!

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.600
‐ [gasps]

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.500
‐ Oh, my. How peculiar.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.633
‐ Towa, what is that thing?

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.300
‐ Wait. Is the smell...

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.400
getting stronger?

00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.666
[all yell]

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.500
‐ [grunts]

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.500
‐ [grunting]

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.466
‐ [Grandpa gasps]
‐ GRAMMA: Oh.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.166
‐ I know that light.

00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.466
I remember. That's it!

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.566
That unbelievably bright place
from my memories...

00:00:59.633 --> 00:01:01.440
and this smell.

00:01:03.173 --> 00:01:04.340
TOWA: Setsuna!

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.140
‐ What? Who could
be calling my name?

00:01:07.173 --> 00:01:10.440
‐ Damn it.
Why do I feel so weak?

00:01:10.473 --> 00:01:13.306
Is it 'cause I came through
the rainbow corridor?

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.006
‐ [laughing]
‐ Eh?

00:01:15.106 --> 00:01:18.806
‐ Wonderful.
Everything is perfect.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.740
The Silver Pearl
is here as well.

00:01:21.806 --> 00:01:26.473
Now I'll have a pearl for each
of my three beautiful eyes!

00:01:26.573 --> 00:01:29.306
‐ Setsuna, I'll save you!

00:01:29.406 --> 00:01:31.473
[yells]

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.140
‐ [clang]
‐ [laughs]

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.073
‐ Huh?

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.140
[yelps]

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.073
‐ [gasps] Impossible.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.773
This thing broke my Kikujumonji!

00:01:44.806 --> 00:01:46.240
[Japanese music playing]

00:03:14.753 --> 00:03:16.653
[Japanese music playing]

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.653
TOWA: "The Dream Butterfly."

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:33.686
[gasps] Impossible.

00:03:33.786 --> 00:03:36.153
This thing broke my Kikujumonji!

00:03:36.253 --> 00:03:38.153
MOROHA: The hell
are you talking about?

00:03:38.186 --> 00:03:39.620
This ain't no Kikujumonji.

00:03:39.653 --> 00:03:40.820
It's a total knockoff!

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:42.186
I mean, look at it.

00:03:42.286 --> 00:03:44.153
The blade patterns
are completely wrong.

00:03:44.253 --> 00:03:45.153
‐ Knockoff?!

00:03:45.253 --> 00:03:46.653
‐ Give it to me.
‐ [gasps]

00:03:46.753 --> 00:03:49.353
‐ I want
the Silver Rainbow Pearl

00:03:49.453 --> 00:03:51.786
you have in your possession.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.653
Hand it over!

00:03:53.753 --> 00:03:56.186
‐ [gasps] I can't move.

00:03:56.286 --> 00:03:59.186
‐ "Silver"?
What are you talking about?

00:03:59.286 --> 00:04:01.193
‐ Give it to me!

00:04:01.293 --> 00:04:03.593
‐ You broke my Kikujumonji!

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.093
‐ [snarling]

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.260
‐ You hurt Setsuna!

00:04:08.326 --> 00:04:09.326
‐ What the...

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.326
‐ [gasps]

00:04:12.593 --> 00:04:13.493
‐ [gasps]

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.160
‐ [yells]

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.493
‐ [shrieking]

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.660
MOROHA: That's awesome!

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.026
She created a demon energy blade
with her own power.

00:04:30.493 --> 00:04:32.493
‐ [gagging]

00:04:36.493 --> 00:04:39.326
‐ Huh?
Did I really do all of this?

00:04:39.426 --> 00:04:43.160
‐ Hey, you! Hurry up,
and finish her off, already!

00:04:43.193 --> 00:04:45.293
‐ What?
I don't wanna be a killer.

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:47.293
‐ This isn't
the time to hesitate!

00:04:47.326 --> 00:04:48.660
‐ [grunting]

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.193
‐ T‐Towa!

00:04:50.293 --> 00:04:51.826
‐ [growling]

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.193
[all gasp]

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:54.826
‐ [hissing]

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.793
‐ [gasps]
‐ Get it now?

00:04:56.826 --> 00:05:00.160
If you don't hurry up,
they'll get devoured!

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.100
‐ [screams]
‐ Stay away!

00:05:02.166 --> 00:05:03.433
‐ Hang on!

00:05:04.866 --> 00:05:07.366
‐ [screams]
‐ [Grammy gasps]

00:05:07.466 --> 00:05:09.300
‐ [gags]

00:05:10.333 --> 00:05:11.300
‐ [gasps]

00:05:12.833 --> 00:05:14.800
‐ [gasping]

00:05:15.866 --> 00:05:17.700
‐ It's nothing personal.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.266
‐ [gasps] You saved us.

00:05:22.333 --> 00:05:23.266
Thank you.

00:05:23.333 --> 00:05:25.166
GRAMMY: Yes, thank you so much.

00:05:25.266 --> 00:05:26.833
We owe you our lives.

00:05:26.866 --> 00:05:29.500
‐ It's fine. [sighs]

00:05:29.533 --> 00:05:31.333
‐ I'm sorry, Setsuna.
‐ [grunts]

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.700
Tell me,
how do you know my name?

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.333
‐ [gasps]
‐ Who are you?

00:05:38.433 --> 00:05:40.166
‐ Don't you recognize me,
Setsuna?

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.300
It's me, Towa, your sister.

00:05:42.333 --> 00:05:44.533
When we were little,
you called me Sis.

00:05:45.633 --> 00:05:46.766
‐ Hoo, man!

00:05:46.833 --> 00:05:48.500
I don't wanna
go through that again.

00:05:48.533 --> 00:05:51.500
At least I can
finally move my body now. Eh?

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.273
‐ [gasps]
‐ Hey there!

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.506
Welcome back!

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.773
‐ [gasps]

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.540
[heart beats]

00:06:12.473 --> 00:06:14.806
‐ Oh?
‐ What are those things?

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.606
[gasping]

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.106
‐ I must say, this sure
brings back some fond memories.

00:06:26.173 --> 00:06:28.206
‐ Yes. It reminds me
of the times

00:06:28.306 --> 00:06:31.506
Inuyasha would come here
to visit Kagome.

00:06:31.606 --> 00:06:33.306
‐ Ah, Indeed.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.206
‐ [gasps]

00:06:35.306 --> 00:06:36.506
‐ [sighs]

00:06:38.306 --> 00:06:41.206
‐ Hey! You don't care
if I keep the head, do you?

00:06:41.306 --> 00:06:43.140
‐ No. Just take it.

00:06:43.173 --> 00:06:44.473
‐ Nice!

00:06:44.506 --> 00:06:46.706
Anyway, what a trip, right?

00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:49.206
But where the heck are we?

00:06:49.306 --> 00:06:51.706
This whole place
is as bright as day!

00:06:51.806 --> 00:06:54.340
TOWA: I'm so sorry.

00:06:54.373 --> 00:06:56.673
It's all my fault, isn't it?

00:06:56.706 --> 00:06:59.706
You must be angry because I
let go of you that day.

00:06:59.806 --> 00:07:01.780
That's why you're
acting cold, right?

00:07:01.846 --> 00:07:03.346
I don't blame you.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.546
[gasps]

00:07:05.646 --> 00:07:07.280
Setsuna?

00:07:07.346 --> 00:07:09.046
I don't know who you are.

00:07:09.146 --> 00:07:11.646
Don't come near me
if you value your life.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.446
If you take
even one step, I'll‐‐

00:07:13.513 --> 00:07:16.346
[gasps] You're dead!

00:07:16.446 --> 00:07:18.146
[yells]

00:07:19.646 --> 00:07:21.146
What the...

00:07:25.313 --> 00:07:27.346
‐ Stop running!
‐ Not a chance!

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.346
You're acting like
you really wanna kill me!

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.346
‐ Because I am!

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.513
‐ "Come on, you two.

00:07:31.546 --> 00:07:33.146
"Let's be friendly here!

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.513
Especially you, Setsuna!"

00:07:35.546 --> 00:07:37.513
What's the harm
in letting her near you?

00:07:37.613 --> 00:07:40.280
‐ Silence!
‐ I'm Moroha, by the way.

00:07:40.346 --> 00:07:43.313
My bounty hunter buddies call me
Moroha the Demon Killer.

00:07:43.346 --> 00:07:45.113
It's nice to meet you.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.346
So, what's your name?

00:07:47.446 --> 00:07:48.713
‐ Towa Higurashi.

00:07:48.813 --> 00:07:50.313
‐ Towa, huh?

00:07:50.346 --> 00:07:53.213
OK, Towa, are you
really Setsuna's sister?

00:07:53.313 --> 00:07:55.713
‐ Yeah, of course I am!
I'm her older twin,

00:07:55.813 --> 00:07:58.680
but we got separated
in a forest fire ten years ago!

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.213
‐ Well, there you go.

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:03.153
‐ I've been alone
ever since I can remember.

00:08:03.186 --> 00:08:05.153
Yeah, I get what you're saying,

00:08:05.186 --> 00:08:07.720
but the both of you
are half‐demons.

00:08:09.353 --> 00:08:11.353
When you're as good as I am,

00:08:11.453 --> 00:08:13.820
you can tell just from the feel
of your demon energies.

00:08:13.853 --> 00:08:16.820
See? Setsuna,
you're a half‐demon!

00:08:16.853 --> 00:08:17.820
‐ [sighs]

00:08:17.853 --> 00:08:19.353
‐ I mean, come on.

00:08:19.453 --> 00:08:20.620
How else can you explain

00:08:20.686 --> 00:08:23.286
a Rainbow Pearl
being in your eye?

00:08:23.353 --> 00:08:25.786
Which makes you
a half‐demon, too, Towa.

00:08:25.853 --> 00:08:28.120
‐ Sorry. I'm a what?

00:08:28.186 --> 00:08:29.553
‐ A half‐demon is someone

00:08:29.653 --> 00:08:32.120
who has the blood
of both demon and human.

00:08:32.186 --> 00:08:34.220
You two have
really similar demon energy.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.386
‐ Oh?

00:08:35.486 --> 00:08:37.053
‐ But even if you're the child

00:08:37.153 --> 00:08:38.853
of a great demon,
having human blood

00:08:38.886 --> 00:08:41.386
means you can only inherit
half of the power.

00:08:41.486 --> 00:08:43.186
Something tells me
that's the main reason

00:08:43.286 --> 00:08:45.820
why Setsu is always so edgy.

00:08:45.853 --> 00:08:47.353
‐ [sniffing]
‐ [gasps]

00:08:47.386 --> 00:08:49.120
And if I'm not mistaken,

00:08:49.186 --> 00:08:50.353
which my nose never is,

00:08:50.453 --> 00:08:52.553
your dad's
the great demon Sesshomaru.

00:08:52.653 --> 00:08:54.153
Am I right?

00:08:54.186 --> 00:08:55.820
‐ Huh? Who's Sesshomaru?

00:08:55.853 --> 00:08:57.320
‐ Setsu?

00:08:57.353 --> 00:08:59.353
‐ Don't know.
I've never met him.

00:09:01.393 --> 00:09:04.193
HISUI: Setsuna is
the daughter of Sesshomaru?

00:09:04.293 --> 00:09:06.826
You're saying
she's a half‐demon.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.826
I guess that does explain
why she's so powerful.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.060
‐ This all took place
14 years ago.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.126
One fateful day, Sesshomaru
arrived in the village

00:09:16.193 --> 00:09:19.126
and left with his newborn twins.

00:09:19.193 --> 00:09:23.060
That was the last
I ever saw them until...

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:32.360
One day,
Setsuna appeared at my door.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.526
She told me that she had come

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.793
for "a rite of courage
and cowardice."

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.360
<i>‐ I'll be in your care</i>
<i>for a while.</i>

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.493
‐ What did she mean by a rite?

00:09:43.526 --> 00:09:47.493
‐ A lion will push their cubs
into a bottomless ravine,

00:09:47.526 --> 00:09:50.526
The young ones strong enough
to climb their way out to safety

00:09:50.626 --> 00:09:52.726
are the cubs
the parent will raise.

00:09:52.826 --> 00:09:56.360
That's what is known as the rite
of courage and cowardice.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.460
‐ So that's what
Sesshomaru has chosen to do

00:09:58.526 --> 00:10:00.166
in order to train Setsuna?

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:02.400
‐ Though I cannot
say for certain,

00:10:02.466 --> 00:10:04.166
it's a possibility.

00:10:04.266 --> 00:10:06.266
‐ Back when I was younger,

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.800
Lord Sesshomaru
used to help me pretty often.

00:10:08.833 --> 00:10:12.166
But even though I spent
so much time around him,

00:10:12.266 --> 00:10:15.466
understanding his true
intentions was a challenge.

00:10:15.566 --> 00:10:17.300
‐ You said, "Twins."
Does that mean

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.000
there's another child
out there somewhere?

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.100
‐ It does make me wonder.

00:10:21.133 --> 00:10:22.800
Something that gives me pause

00:10:22.833 --> 00:10:25.766
is knowing those two
are uninformed half‐demons,

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.400
so she may very well

00:10:27.466 --> 00:10:30.166
have already killed her sibling
out of blind hate.

00:10:30.266 --> 00:10:31.666
‐ Oh, no.

00:10:32.833 --> 00:10:35.066
‐ If you truly are
my older sister,

00:10:35.133 --> 00:10:37.133
then you can prove it to me
with your strength.

00:10:37.233 --> 00:10:38.566
‐ I don't need
to prove anything,

00:10:38.633 --> 00:10:40.133
because I'm not lying!

00:10:40.166 --> 00:10:42.266
‐ Empty words
mean nothing to me.

00:10:43.466 --> 00:10:45.400
‐ Come on.
That's enough of that.

00:10:45.466 --> 00:10:46.566
‐ Stay out of this.

00:10:46.633 --> 00:10:48.333
‐ Why are you so stubborn?

00:10:48.433 --> 00:10:49.500
‐ [sighs]
‐ Shut up.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.233
‐ [gasps]

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.733
[yelps]

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.766
‐ [gasps]

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.566
‐ [hisses]

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.140
‐ Is that a...

00:11:00.173 --> 00:11:01.273
‐ Hitokon.

00:11:01.306 --> 00:11:04.240
Looks like it chose her
as its host.

00:11:07.573 --> 00:11:09.340
[Moroha scoffs] That idiot.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.306
See? This is what you get
for letting your guard down!

00:11:12.406 --> 00:11:13.306
Eh?

00:11:14.406 --> 00:11:15.773
[gasps]

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.340
‐ GRAMMY: Towa?
‐ MEI: Stop it!

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.273
What are you doing?!

00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:24.173
‐ That's not the Towa
you know and love anymore.

00:11:24.273 --> 00:11:26.473
All of you
need to go hide somewhere now!

00:11:26.506 --> 00:11:27.640
‐ O‐OK.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.073
‐ You, too, Gramps!

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:31.240
‐ Oh, yes, of course!

00:11:32.306 --> 00:11:33.340
MOROHA: The Hitokon itself

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.273
isn't that difficult to beat,

00:11:35.306 --> 00:11:36.473
but the problem with it

00:11:36.573 --> 00:11:39.773
is it can control
the powers of its host.

00:11:39.806 --> 00:11:43.106
[groans]
This is so damn annoying!

00:11:44.306 --> 00:11:46.606
‐ The girl in red,
she looks like her.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.340
‐ Who, Grammy? What do you mean?

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.006
‐ That look in her eyes...

00:11:50.106 --> 00:11:52.440
it's just like Kagome's.

00:11:54.306 --> 00:11:55.240
‐ [gasps]

00:11:58.173 --> 00:11:59.140
[grunts]

00:12:01.746 --> 00:12:03.080
‐ Oh, man!

00:12:03.146 --> 00:12:06.346
‐ I see. Interesting.

00:12:06.446 --> 00:12:07.513
‐ [gasps]

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.313
‐ So that's your demon energy's
true potential.

00:12:18.413 --> 00:12:21.646
Then perhaps I will treat you
as a worthy opponent.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.680
‐ Hold on, Setsuna.

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.180
Are you seriously
gonna kill your sister?

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.280
Anyone standing against me
is my enemy.

00:12:31.313 --> 00:12:33.480
Cyclone Burst!

00:12:36.313 --> 00:12:37.580
‐ [grunts]

00:12:37.646 --> 00:12:39.146
‐ [wails]

00:12:46.146 --> 00:12:47.113
‐ Impossible!

00:12:47.146 --> 00:12:48.313
‐ [wails]

00:12:49.413 --> 00:12:50.446
‐ [yells]

00:12:55.946 --> 00:12:57.846
‐ [yells]

00:12:59.686 --> 00:13:00.620
[dragon roars]

00:13:03.586 --> 00:13:04.620
‐ Hah!

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.953
‐ That was uncalled for.

00:13:07.986 --> 00:13:09.486
‐ Yo, Setsuna!

00:13:09.586 --> 00:13:12.286
You call yourself
a demon slayer, don't you?

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.453
Shouldn't you at least

00:13:13.486 --> 00:13:15.453
have some potion
to weaken the Hitokon?

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.786
‐ [sighs]
‐ [running footsteps]

00:13:22.953 --> 00:13:24.686
[gasps]

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.286
Scourge of Swallows!

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.286
‐ [gasps]

00:13:49.953 --> 00:13:51.286
MEI: Towa!

00:13:51.353 --> 00:13:53.486
Towa, you have to stop!

00:13:53.586 --> 00:13:54.620
What's gotten into you?

00:13:54.653 --> 00:13:56.620
‐ Hey! Get out of here, kid!

00:13:56.686 --> 00:13:57.620
‐ Mei!

00:13:57.686 --> 00:13:58.786
‐ Oh, no!

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:02.793
‐ [sighs]
‐ [gasps]

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.260
[screams]

00:14:04.293 --> 00:14:05.426
‐ Mei!

00:14:08.293 --> 00:14:09.493
[gasps] Mei?

00:14:09.593 --> 00:14:10.493
‐ Her face!

00:14:10.593 --> 00:14:12.193
‐ Ah, that bastard!

00:14:12.293 --> 00:14:13.926
It transferred over to the kid.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.260
‐ [gasps]

00:14:15.293 --> 00:14:16.860
Mei. Oh, no.

00:14:21.493 --> 00:14:23.360
‐ Mei, what are you doing?

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:24.826
‐ Is she being controlled?

00:14:24.926 --> 00:14:26.426
Wake up!

00:14:27.926 --> 00:14:30.160
SETSUNA: Hold it right there.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.593
[scoffs]
You figured a small child

00:14:32.626 --> 00:14:35.626
would be easier to control.
How foolish.

00:14:35.693 --> 00:14:37.460
‐ What are you planning to do?

00:14:37.493 --> 00:14:38.593
‐ Don't worry.

00:14:38.626 --> 00:14:41.593
I'm going to cut out
the Hitokon.

00:14:41.626 --> 00:14:42.860
‐ You can't!

00:14:44.626 --> 00:14:45.626
Don't touch her!

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.860
I won't let you scar her face.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.326
‐ Oh?

00:14:49.426 --> 00:14:51.526
‐ Please no. Not like this!

00:14:51.626 --> 00:14:54.760
I won't trouble this family
any more than I already have.

00:14:54.793 --> 00:14:56.960
‐ [scoffs] Such naivetÃ©.

00:14:56.993 --> 00:14:58.626
‐ What did you say?

00:14:58.660 --> 00:14:59.700
[gasps]

00:15:02.433 --> 00:15:04.200
[gasps]

00:15:06.533 --> 00:15:08.800
Mei, this is my fault.

00:15:08.833 --> 00:15:10.433
I'm sorry.

00:15:10.466 --> 00:15:11.933
I am so sorry.

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.633
‐ As long as you're alive,

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.300
you will always trouble someone,

00:15:16.333 --> 00:15:17.800
whether you mean to or not.

00:15:18.866 --> 00:15:19.800
‐ Hey, stop that!

00:15:19.866 --> 00:15:20.933
‐ That's your sister!

00:15:20.966 --> 00:15:22.266
TOWA: It's fine.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.766
It's alright.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.633
It'll be alright. I promise.

00:15:30.933 --> 00:15:33.300
‐ Moon of the Resting Moth.

00:15:34.366 --> 00:15:35.866
[moths fluttering]

00:15:40.633 --> 00:15:42.300
‐ [sighing]

00:15:42.366 --> 00:15:44.300
[both sighing]

00:15:51.966 --> 00:15:53.633
‐ So did you kill them?

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.666
A resting moth's powder
only makes you fall asleep.

00:15:58.633 --> 00:16:00.306
‐ <i>You saved us. Thank you!</i>

00:16:01.373 --> 00:16:03.506
‐ [sighs] Just this once.

00:16:09.773 --> 00:16:11.640
‐ [squealing]

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.773
‐ Really? You had slayer potion

00:16:17.806 --> 00:16:19.640
in your elbow pocket
this whole time?

00:16:19.706 --> 00:16:22.306
The Hitokon, huh?

00:16:22.373 --> 00:16:25.206
The bounty for this ugly thing's
pretty stingy.

00:16:25.306 --> 00:16:28.506
Well, It still might be
enough to pay for lunch!

00:16:28.606 --> 00:16:30.206
Huh? What's with you?

00:16:32.373 --> 00:16:34.273
KAEDE: If I understand
what you've told me,

00:16:34.306 --> 00:16:37.273
Mistress Three‐Eyes, Setsuna,

00:16:37.306 --> 00:16:40.173
and the other girl
vanished near the Sacred Tree?

00:16:40.273 --> 00:16:42.340
‐ That's correct. Hisui.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.273
‐ Right. Take a look.

00:16:44.306 --> 00:16:47.273
This was attached
to the Sacred Tree's root.

00:16:47.306 --> 00:16:49.473
‐ I believe that's Root Head.

00:16:49.506 --> 00:16:52.473
‐ I recognized it, too.
The moment I laid eyes on it,

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.373
I knew I'd seen it before.

00:16:54.473 --> 00:16:55.673
Hisui, this is a demon

00:16:55.773 --> 00:16:58.540
we had slain
back when you were a baby.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.613
KAEDE: If Root Head
really did attach itself

00:17:00.646 --> 00:17:04.313
to the Sacred Tree,
this could be a serious problem.

00:17:04.346 --> 00:17:06.480
‐ From what I recall
about demon trees,

00:17:06.546 --> 00:17:09.880
they have the ability to absorb
power from their hosts,

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.680
sort of like the Hitokon.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.813
‐ Your memory is correct.

00:17:13.846 --> 00:17:15.346
And now it has attached itself

00:17:15.446 --> 00:17:17.880
to the Tree of Ages,
of all things.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.313
‐ The what?

00:17:19.346 --> 00:17:21.313
KOHAKU: I've heard
of the Sacred Tree

00:17:21.346 --> 00:17:26.313
being called the Tree of Ages,
but why is that?

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.780
KAEDE: Kohaku,
tell me, you are aware

00:17:28.813 --> 00:17:31.180
of the Bone Eater's Well,
are you not?

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.680
‐ I am. It's the well that
Lady Kagome and Lord Inuyasha

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.280
used to travel through,
isn't it?

00:17:37.313 --> 00:17:41.480
‐ It's been over 15 years since
it became impossible to use.

00:17:41.546 --> 00:17:44.546
But according to Kagome,
when the well was working,

00:17:44.646 --> 00:17:47.380
it had the power
to travel across time.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.213
‐ Travel across time?

00:17:49.313 --> 00:17:51.780
‐ Kagome and Inuyasha
simply referred to it

00:17:51.813 --> 00:17:53.713
as going to "the other world."

00:17:53.813 --> 00:17:55.613
‐ They went back and forth?

00:17:55.646 --> 00:17:57.513
KAEDE: That well was made

00:17:57.613 --> 00:18:00.653
using wood harvested
from the Tree of Ages.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.386
And if Root Head truly managed

00:18:02.486 --> 00:18:05.286
to attach itself
to the same Sacred Tree...

00:18:06.553 --> 00:18:08.386
it may very well have absorbed

00:18:08.486 --> 00:18:09.886
the Tree of Ages' power,

00:18:09.986 --> 00:18:11.786
so now it's entirely possible

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.386
it has the ability
to cross into the other world.

00:18:14.486 --> 00:18:15.720
‐ [gasps]
‐ You mean,

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.886
Setsuna and the others
may have gone to...

00:18:17.986 --> 00:18:20.286
‐ Tokyo.
They may be in the village

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.953
which Kagome
originally called home.

00:18:22.986 --> 00:18:24.386
‐ If that's where they are,

00:18:24.486 --> 00:18:26.653
will they even
be able to come back?

00:18:26.686 --> 00:18:28.186
‐ I don't know.
‐ [gasps]

00:18:28.286 --> 00:18:29.853
‐ If they are able to return,

00:18:29.953 --> 00:18:33.853
I'm afraid
it will be no easy task.

00:18:39.286 --> 00:18:41.620
[jet engine passing]

00:18:41.653 --> 00:18:43.553
MRS. HIGURASHI:
Did Towa already go to bed?

00:18:43.653 --> 00:18:45.886
SOTA: Yeah. She said
she was really tired.

00:18:45.986 --> 00:18:49.686
‐ I bet. Things sure have
taken an interesting turn.

00:18:49.786 --> 00:18:51.486
‐ [laughs]

00:18:51.553 --> 00:18:54.820
I mentioned it before, didn't I,
that demons were real?

00:18:54.853 --> 00:18:57.353
‐ Yes, you did.
I've always believed you,

00:18:57.453 --> 00:18:58.820
so that's not an issue.

00:18:58.886 --> 00:19:02.493
Although this Kikujumonji,
on the other hand,

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.393
I had been holding on to this
for the museum for safekeeping.

00:19:06.493 --> 00:19:07.993
‐ [chuckles] Uh‐oh.

00:19:08.026 --> 00:19:09.960
‐ Daddy!
‐ Well, that's life!

00:19:09.993 --> 00:19:12.893
We've had it this long, so we'll
just keep holding on to it.

00:19:12.993 --> 00:19:14.493
‐ Mommy, listen.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.960
We need to talk
about Towa right now!

00:19:16.993 --> 00:19:18.793
You're not gonna believe this!

00:19:18.826 --> 00:19:21.693
Towa's powers are so cool!
You should have seen it!

00:19:21.793 --> 00:19:23.993
‐ Yeah. I have to admit
I already knew

00:19:24.026 --> 00:19:25.693
she could do
extraordinary things.

00:19:25.793 --> 00:19:27.893
‐ Oh, I'm not
too worried about Towa.

00:19:27.993 --> 00:19:29.493
Our daughter's
been a troublemaker

00:19:29.526 --> 00:19:31.726
for the last ten years,
so I'm used to it.

00:19:31.826 --> 00:19:32.826
‐ I guess you're right.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:34.360
What we really
need to talk about

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.493
are those girls
from the other era.

00:19:36.526 --> 00:19:37.660
‐ MOROHA: Whoo!
‐ Hmm?

00:19:37.726 --> 00:19:39.326
‐ That felt awesome!

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.793
You wanna know what?

00:19:40.826 --> 00:19:43.693
I've never splashed around
in hot water like that!

00:19:43.793 --> 00:19:45.626
‐ Uh...
‐ Oh, how nice for you!

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.393
Well, it's getting late.

00:19:47.493 --> 00:19:49.326
What do you think?
You ready to turn in?

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.793
‐ Good idea.

00:19:50.826 --> 00:19:52.993
I think I will, thank you!

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:55.693
But damn!
That was really amazing!

00:19:55.793 --> 00:19:57.393
[laughs]

00:19:57.493 --> 00:20:00.133
‐ By the way, my mom
has a theory about that girl.

00:20:00.233 --> 00:20:02.766
She thinks it's possible
she's Kagome's daughter.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.133
‐ Oh! That would mean we have
a new relative on our hands!

00:20:06.233 --> 00:20:07.900
‐ If mom's right, then yeah.

00:20:07.933 --> 00:20:10.233
‐ Well, letting the girls
stay for a while

00:20:10.266 --> 00:20:11.766
shouldn't be a problem
in that case.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.433
‐ [laughs]
It's like you read my mind.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:18.733
‐ Yay! That means I get three
older sisters to play with!

00:20:19.766 --> 00:20:20.733
MOROHA: Come on.

00:20:20.766 --> 00:20:22.433
Just accept it, already.

00:20:22.466 --> 00:20:24.766
You saw
how much demon power she had.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.133
The way I see it,
she can't be lying

00:20:27.233 --> 00:20:29.333
about being
your older twin sister.

00:20:29.433 --> 00:20:33.266
‐ I don't have any memories
at all from when I was younger.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.733
Besides, this isn't something
I can readily accept.

00:20:36.766 --> 00:20:38.633
There is no way
someone who indulges

00:20:38.733 --> 00:20:42.333
in idle slumber like that
can be related to me by blood.

00:20:42.433 --> 00:20:45.333
‐ Aha. I knew it.
‐ [grunts]

00:20:45.433 --> 00:20:46.733
‐ Hey, Setsu,

00:20:46.766 --> 00:20:48.766
you've never slept, have you?

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.266
‐ [gasps]
‐ MOROHA: Bull's‐eye.

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.433
‐ Sleep is a weakness
that leaves you open to attack.

00:20:54.466 --> 00:20:56.900
Everyone in the Warring Age
is aware of that.

00:20:56.933 --> 00:20:58.633
‐ Nope, that's not it.

00:20:58.733 --> 00:21:01.273
It's not that you
don't wanna fall asleep.

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:02.640
It's that you can't.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.140
Don't act like you don't know.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.906
Your dreams got eaten
by the Dream Butterfly, huh?

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.606
‐ I don't know what you mean.
Explain.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.173
‐ I'm saying
you're under a nasty curse.

00:21:15.273 --> 00:21:16.606
A butterfly in the dream world

00:21:16.673 --> 00:21:19.340
managed to escape
over into ours,

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.573
and because of that,
you can never fall asleep,

00:21:22.606 --> 00:21:25.440
let alone
have any dreams ever again.

00:21:25.506 --> 00:21:28.440
‐ <i>Setsuna can't fall asleep?</i>

00:21:28.473 --> 00:21:30.440
<i>And she's unable to dream?</i>

00:21:30.506 --> 00:21:33.140
<i>But she was perfectly fine</i>
<i>back then.</i>

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.573
<i>All of this,</i>

00:21:35.606 --> 00:21:38.240
<i>everything she's</i>
<i>had to endure happened</i>

00:21:38.273 --> 00:21:40.440
<i>because I let go of her hand.</i>

00:21:40.473 --> 00:21:44.306
<i>It was all my fault.</i>

00:21:44.406 --> 00:21:47.140
‐ And you know what else?
I bet you also tested

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.740
the resting moths' powder
on yourself, right?

00:21:49.773 --> 00:21:52.606
The reason you don't have
memories of your childhood

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.340
is because they were also
stolen by the Dream Butterfly.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.306
‐ I don't see why this matters.

00:21:58.406 --> 00:22:01.780
In the Warring Age,
this all works to my advantage.

00:22:01.846 --> 00:22:03.246
‐ Come on.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.280
‐ Setsuna!
‐ Hmm?

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.613
[Japanese music playing]

00:23:41.753 --> 00:23:43.620
TOWA: <i>Moroha comes up</i>
<i>with a plan to negotiate</i>

00:23:43.653 --> 00:23:46.420
<i>with Root Head to pass</i>
<i>through the corridor of time.</i>

00:23:46.453 --> 00:23:48.586
<i>It's a pretty wild idea.</i>

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.620
<i>In order for Setsuna</i>
<i>to be able to fall asleep</i>

00:23:50.686 --> 00:23:52.453
<i>and have dreams,</i>
<i>we need to find</i>

00:23:52.486 --> 00:23:54.453
<i>the Dream Butterfly</i>
<i>in the Feudal Era.</i>

00:23:54.486 --> 00:23:56.486
<i>But we run into someone</i>
<i>in the corridor.</i>

00:23:56.586 --> 00:23:58.186
MOROHA: <i>Is the Tree of Ages</i>

00:23:58.286 --> 00:23:59.626
<i>supposed to look</i>
<i>like a priestess?</i>

00:23:59.693 --> 00:24:01.160
SETSUNA: <i>Who are you?</i>

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:02.926
TOWA: Next time on Yashahime,

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.293
<i>"The Gateway to the Past."</i>

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.526
‐ Welcome,
Half‐Demon Princesses.

00:24:06.626 --> 00:24:09.626
I have a request
for the daughters of Sesshomaru.
