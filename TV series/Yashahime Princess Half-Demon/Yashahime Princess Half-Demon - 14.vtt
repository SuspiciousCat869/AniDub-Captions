‐ No, we haven't.

I can't believe we're
slaying demons left and right,

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:00.313

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:02.616
‐ Why are you
in so much debt anyway?

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:05.185
‐ It's all
because of that master!

00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:23.369
‐ A smartphone.
Remember in the other world?

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:24.771
I used it all the time.

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:27.307
‐ Did you?
I don't remember that. [sniffs]

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.443
‐ Yeah. It lets you
make calls, read your email,

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:33.346

check social media.

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.015

you can search the Internet

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:43.389
Of course, with no signal here,
there's no point in having it,

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.225

You really can't let go of it?

but it sounds dangerous.

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:53.867
‐ Wait. Hang on! I think I have
something like that, too!

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.969
You see?
It's the lucky kappa foot

Oh, hi.

00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:30.771
‐ See? It's weird
for someone so pretty

00:04:30.771 --> 00:04:32.739
to be in a dump like this,
isn't it?

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:33.840
‐ Very funny.

00:04:33.874 --> 00:04:36.009

‐ Hey, you three! [grumbles]

You need to show
some respect! Hmm?

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:49.623
‐ The request
isn't actually coming from me.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.458
The task in question
is for this young lady.

‐ I am Tamano.
It's a pleasure to meet you all.

SETSUNA: Homura?

00:05:05.606 --> 00:05:08.709
‐ Yes. Homura and I
lived alone in a mansion

00:05:08.742 --> 00:05:11.477
in the northern snowy mountains
until recently.

00:05:11.545 --> 00:05:14.781
‐ Really? Does that mean you and
Homura were husband and wife?

00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:16.482
‐ No.
‐ Hmm?

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:19.385
‐ Even if Miss Tamano
doesn't think they were married,

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.889
it's rather likely Homura was
under that impression himself.

00:05:22.923 --> 00:05:23.890
‐ [sighs]

00:05:23.924 --> 00:05:25.659
‐ What do you mean by that?

00:05:25.726 --> 00:05:28.662
‐ Miss Tamano, would you
tell them what happened?

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:29.796
‐ Of course.

00:05:31.064 --> 00:05:32.966
‐ Ever since
I was a little girl,

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.068
I've been raised
by my grandparents

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:38.672
in a village at the foot
of a snowy mountain.

00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:40.507
‐ <i>She's so beautiful.</i>

<i>‐ I've never seen</i>
<i>someone so gorgeous.</i>

00:05:43.143 --> 00:05:47.614
‐ But my life suddenly changed
after I turned 13.

00:05:47.648 --> 00:05:50.350
I'm not sure why,
but marriage proposals

00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:52.919
started arriving for me
almost every day.

00:05:52.953 --> 00:05:57.023
Even merchants and samurai from
faraway towns came to visit.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.492
<i>‐ Miss Tamano</i>
<i>will become my bride.</i>

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:01.528
‐ <i>No, I will take care of her!</i>

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:04.998
‐ I didn't want to leave
the village or my family,

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:07.868
so I turned
each one of them down.

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:11.705
However, something
happened one night.

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:15.709

‐ And that was
when Homura appeared.

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:45.972
Just like that, he dragged me
away to the snowy mountains.

00:06:46.006 --> 00:06:48.074
‐ He dragged you away?
What a jerk.

00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:49.475
‐ Agreed.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.177
‐ Why would he do
something like that?

00:06:51.211 --> 00:06:54.748
‐ Because he wanted Miss Tamano
all to himself, obviously.

00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:55.982
‐ All to himself?

00:06:56.016 --> 00:06:57.183
‐ Huh?

00:06:57.217 --> 00:06:58.919
‐ [sighs]

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.688
‐ Ever since that night,

00:07:01.722 --> 00:07:03.690
I was forced to live with Homura

00:07:03.724 --> 00:07:06.760
in his mansion
deep within the snowy mountains.

00:07:06.827 --> 00:07:08.061
Strangely, his mansion

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:10.096
was the only place
the snow didn't touch.

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:13.099
‐ [birds chirping]
‐ It always seemed like spring.

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:17.604
When I first arrived,

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:21.107
Homura treated me
with warmth and kindness.

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:23.877
In fact,
he took very good care of me.

00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:26.780
But then...

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.782

00:07:34.555 --> 00:07:36.056
‐ You there!

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:38.792

MAN: No. I didn't mean‐‐

00:07:40.527 --> 00:07:41.862
Our eyes just met by chance.

00:07:41.895 --> 00:07:43.797
‐ I don't care!

00:07:43.864 --> 00:07:44.798
‐ W‐Wait!

00:07:44.865 --> 00:07:46.800

00:07:46.867 --> 00:07:48.535
‐ [gasps]

00:07:51.071 --> 00:07:53.574
Because he
accidentally met my gaze,

00:07:53.607 --> 00:07:56.042
Homura brutally killed
that gardener.

00:07:56.076 --> 00:07:58.545
After that,
he began to do the same thing

00:07:58.579 --> 00:08:00.647
to every guest that visited.

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:02.749

that you ordered from me.

00:08:04.284 --> 00:08:05.552

satisfactory to your tastes?

00:08:28.074 --> 00:08:29.976

‐ Don't act as though
you're innocent in all of this.

00:08:46.993 --> 00:08:49.696
You're to blame.
You must have behaved in a way

00:08:49.763 --> 00:08:51.031
that lured them in somehow.

00:08:51.097 --> 00:08:53.667
‐ I would never do
something like that.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.536

00:08:55.602 --> 00:08:58.138

all these men.

No one else will look

don't do this, please!

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:11.785
I'm begging you!

00:09:11.818 --> 00:09:12.986
Lord Homura!

00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:18.058
Homura had me
locked away in a jail cell.

00:09:18.124 --> 00:09:19.560
But...

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:25.899
[grunting]

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:33.206
[panting]

00:09:34.307 --> 00:09:36.877
I managed to escape
from the mansion,

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.212
and while I was
trekking down the mountain...

00:09:44.184 --> 00:09:46.086
TAKECHIYO:
Lord Riku found her

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:49.923
and heroically saved her
from a tragic fate.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:51.157
Mm‐hmm.

00:09:51.191 --> 00:09:53.827
‐ And that brings
the story to a close.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.829
‐ So that's what happened.

00:09:55.862 --> 00:09:58.164
‐ Well, it's not as though
I don't understand

00:09:58.198 --> 00:10:00.834
Homura getting worried
and jealous over her.

00:10:00.867 --> 00:10:02.936
‐ You've gotta admit,
having all those people

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:04.605
getting jealous
for your attention

00:10:04.671 --> 00:10:06.840
has to feel pretty good,
don't you think?

00:10:06.873 --> 00:10:09.042
‐ And what's your opinion
on this, Lady Towa?

00:10:09.075 --> 00:10:10.911
‐ You're asking me?

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:14.014
Is it like how I can't seem
to let go of my smartphone?

00:10:14.047 --> 00:10:15.849
It's almost the same
as addiction.

00:10:15.882 --> 00:10:18.084
‐ A smart what?
‐ Huh?

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:20.253
‐ What the heck
are you talking about?

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:21.354
‐ Oh, um...

00:10:21.387 --> 00:10:22.856
it's nothing.

00:10:22.889 --> 00:10:24.958
‐ [Riku chuckles]
‐ [gasps]

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.728
But if we're dealing
with someone who's that jealous

00:10:27.761 --> 00:10:30.063
and he finds out
that Riku took her in...

00:10:30.096 --> 00:10:31.865
‐ Then he might be in danger.

00:10:31.898 --> 00:10:34.868
‐ Yeah. Homura is
totally gonna kill you.

00:10:34.901 --> 00:10:37.804
‐ Aptly put,
which is why I'm here,

00:10:37.871 --> 00:10:40.373
to ask for you
to slay Homura in my stead.

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:42.275
‐ You want us to fight him?

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:45.111
‐ You're asking
for something so dangerous.

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:48.048
But Homura is
an incredibly powerful god.

00:10:48.081 --> 00:10:49.449
You cannot ask
these young ladies

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.718
to take such a terrible risk.

00:10:51.752 --> 00:10:54.087
‐ Usually I would agree,
but you see,

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.757
these three are not
your typical young ladies.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:57.891
‐ Huh?

00:10:57.924 --> 00:10:59.893
‐ They're
the Half‐Demon Princesses.

00:10:59.926 --> 00:11:01.461
‐ Half‐Demon Princesses?

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:04.464
‐ They wouldn't refuse
the opportunity anyway.

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:07.400
We're talking about the head
of an evil mountain god,

00:11:07.433 --> 00:11:10.436
which means his bounty
will be tremendous.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:11.437
‐ [gasps] Really?

00:11:11.471 --> 00:11:12.939
‐ Not only that,

00:11:12.973 --> 00:11:14.975
but you won't have to clean
this place anymore.

00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:17.177
‐ Yes! You can count me in!

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:20.246
Setsu, Towa, you're in,
too, right, aren't you?

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.948
BOTH: Hmm.

00:11:23.083 --> 00:11:24.117
‐ [chuckles]

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.286
TOWA: Guess we
had to accept the job

00:11:26.319 --> 00:11:28.188
after Moroha pressured us, huh?

00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:29.255
‐ Yeah.

00:11:29.289 --> 00:11:30.757
‐ Three heads
are better than one,

00:11:30.791 --> 00:11:31.925
after all. Am I right?

00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.426
‐ I still don't understand

00:11:33.459 --> 00:11:36.129
why I had to tag along
with you guys.

00:11:36.162 --> 00:11:37.197
‐ [wind blows]
‐ [shudders]

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:45.138
‐ Tamano.

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:48.875
Where did you go?!

00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:54.014
‐ [sneezes]

00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:55.281
So cold.

00:11:55.315 --> 00:11:57.017
‐ I can't go any further.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.519
It's freezing out here!

00:11:58.552 --> 00:12:00.120
‐ [shivering]

00:12:00.153 --> 00:12:01.855
‐ It's really coming down,
isn't it?

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:04.525
‐ I'm getting out of here.
Later!

00:12:04.558 --> 00:12:07.628
‐ Kirara, you go back, too.
Get out of the cold.

00:12:07.661 --> 00:12:10.296
‐ [growls]
‐ It's freezing!

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.498
[shivers]
Where's the stupid mansion?!

00:12:12.533 --> 00:12:15.035
‐ [gasps] Over there.

00:12:19.005 --> 00:12:20.907
There's no snow around it.

00:12:20.974 --> 00:12:21.908
‐ Let's go.

00:12:21.975 --> 00:12:22.876
‐ Cold!

00:12:24.344 --> 00:12:25.979
‐ RIKU: What's wrong?
‐ [grunts]

00:12:26.012 --> 00:12:28.414
I'm just so worried about them.

00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:31.017
I wonder if this was
the right thing to do.

00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:33.253
‐ You'll never
be able to escape him

00:12:33.319 --> 00:12:35.388
if someone doesn't
take care of him for good.

00:12:35.388 --> 00:12:37.691
No matter where you hide,

00:12:37.724 --> 00:12:41.261
Homura will always
figure out how to find you.

00:12:41.327 --> 00:12:44.197
All that being said,
the love affairs that happen

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:47.267
between demons and humans
will never make sense to me.

00:12:48.735 --> 00:12:50.671
[wind blowing]

00:12:50.704 --> 00:12:52.706
TOWA: Miss Tamano
wasn't kidding.

00:12:52.739 --> 00:12:54.675
It's just like spring in here.

00:12:54.708 --> 00:12:55.676
‐ Yeah.

00:12:55.709 --> 00:12:56.577
‐ Hey, check it out.

00:12:58.745 --> 00:13:00.514
‐ Tamano!

00:13:00.547 --> 00:13:02.282
Where are you?!

00:13:02.348 --> 00:13:04.417
How dare you leave my side?!

00:13:04.417 --> 00:13:06.119
Where have you gone?!

00:13:06.186 --> 00:13:08.088
‐ That's him, Homura.

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:10.056
‐ So what now?

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:11.357
‐ Charge!

00:13:11.391 --> 00:13:13.627
‐ Wait!
Moroha, get back here now!

00:13:13.694 --> 00:13:15.261
‐ Yo, Homura!
‐ Hmm?

00:13:15.261 --> 00:13:18.364
‐ You can search all you want,
but Miss Tamano's gone.

00:13:18.398 --> 00:13:20.433
‐ [groans] You never think

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:23.369
about the consequences
of your actions.

00:13:23.403 --> 00:13:24.638
‐ Who are you?

00:13:24.705 --> 00:13:26.640
Did you take away my Tamano?

00:13:26.707 --> 00:13:28.709
‐ Hold up! "My Tamano"?

00:13:28.742 --> 00:13:30.577
She doesn't belong
to you or anybody!

00:13:30.611 --> 00:13:33.446
‐ Enough! Tell me
where she is right now!

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:36.116
‐ Hah! Like we'd ever tell you.

00:13:36.116 --> 00:13:37.618
If you refuse...

00:13:37.618 --> 00:13:38.652
[yells]

00:13:38.719 --> 00:13:40.053
[all gasp]

00:13:41.555 --> 00:13:42.488
BOTH: Moroha!

00:13:42.556 --> 00:13:44.124
‐ Hot! Hot!
‐ [patting]

00:13:44.124 --> 00:13:45.659
Hot!

00:13:47.628 --> 00:13:48.595
[mutters]

00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:49.730
[gasps]

00:13:49.763 --> 00:13:52.398
You're no match
for my Robe of the Fire‐rat!

00:13:52.432 --> 00:13:53.499
‐ Where is she?

00:13:53.567 --> 00:13:55.468
Where is Tamano? Tell me!

00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:57.137
Answer, you wretches!

00:13:57.137 --> 00:13:59.305
SETSUNA: Miss Tamano
will never return here.

00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:01.742
‐ What?!
‐ TOWA: Listen up, Homura.

00:14:01.775 --> 00:14:04.511
You see, you can't
just keep someone at your side

00:14:04.578 --> 00:14:07.280
without their consent.
That's just selfish!

00:14:07.313 --> 00:14:09.449
‐ Shut up. Shut up!

00:14:09.482 --> 00:14:11.585
[music playing]

00:14:15.088 --> 00:14:16.657
It can't be!

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.660
‐ Scourge of Swallows!

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:20.661
‐ [grumbles]

00:14:20.694 --> 00:14:22.663
‐ [yells]

00:14:22.696 --> 00:14:24.497
‐ You're those damn twins,

00:14:24.497 --> 00:14:27.668
the ones with
the Gold and Silver Pearls.

00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:29.670
‐ Get ready!

00:14:29.703 --> 00:14:31.505
‐ Then there's no way I can...

00:14:31.505 --> 00:14:32.606
[inhales]

00:14:34.107 --> 00:14:35.676
‐ [gasps]
‐ Towa!

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:38.378
‐ I'm OK!

00:14:38.444 --> 00:14:41.515
‐ I never expected the two
of you would still be alive.

00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:43.517
‐ What do you mean?

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.519
‐ Are you saying
you know us somehow?

00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:47.287
‐ I was so sure...

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.354
long ago...

00:14:48.354 --> 00:14:50.524
that I had killed
the both of you.

00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:51.525
[both gasp]

00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:54.327
[music playing]

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.562
ZERO: <i>Homura...</i>

00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:58.198
<i>I want you</i>
<i>to burn that forest down.</i>

00:14:58.198 --> 00:14:59.365
‐ <i>Are you sure?</i>

00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:01.367
‐ <i>Yes. Aren't we...</i>

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:03.303
<i>Lord Sesshomaru?</i>

00:15:09.643 --> 00:15:13.547
<i>Burn it all until</i>
<i>those cursed half‐demon sisters</i>

00:15:13.547 --> 00:15:15.549
<i>are wiped</i>
<i>from this plane of existence.</i>

00:15:15.549 --> 00:15:17.217
‐ <i>Understood.</i>

00:15:17.217 --> 00:15:19.219
TOWA: <i>This way! Hurry!</i>

00:15:19.219 --> 00:15:21.221
‐ <i>Sis!</i>

00:15:21.221 --> 00:15:24.024
Don't leave me, Sis! [gasps]

00:15:25.559 --> 00:15:28.094
‐ I thought I had burned it all,

00:15:28.161 --> 00:15:30.564
leaving no traces
of anything left,

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:33.867
but for both of you sisters
to have survived that...

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.401
TOWA: Then that means you're...

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:36.537
That's right.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:39.506
The one who burned down
that forest was me.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.274
‐ [growls]

00:15:41.341 --> 00:15:43.577
‐ So it was you.
‐ [gasps]

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.178
‐ It was you.

00:15:45.211 --> 00:15:47.614
‐ <i>Setsuna!</i>

00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:53.219
<i>Setsuna!</i>

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:56.389
It's your fault Setsuna and I...

00:15:56.422 --> 00:15:59.425
were torn apart
in the forest that day!

00:16:02.596 --> 00:16:04.364
‐ [footsteps approach]
‐ Going somewhere?

00:16:04.397 --> 00:16:05.365
‐ [gasps]

00:16:05.398 --> 00:16:06.800
Mr. Riku.

00:16:06.867 --> 00:16:08.602
‐ Even if you go back there,

00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:10.303
you won't be able
to change anything.

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.640
‐ That may be.
But still, if anyone is going

00:16:13.707 --> 00:16:16.777
to settle things with Homura,
then it's got to be me.

00:16:16.777 --> 00:16:18.111
I can't let those girls

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:20.781
put themselves
in danger for my sake.

00:16:20.781 --> 00:16:22.148
‐ [sighs]

00:16:22.215 --> 00:16:23.784
Alright, then.

00:16:23.784 --> 00:16:27.320
If you want to go that badly,
then I'll accompany you.

00:16:27.387 --> 00:16:28.789
‐ [gasps]
‐ There's something

00:16:28.789 --> 00:16:31.658
that I'm interested
in seeing for myself anyway.

00:16:31.725 --> 00:16:32.893
[chime rings]

00:16:32.926 --> 00:16:34.227
‐ I heard your call.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.796
Is there something you need,
Lord Riku?

00:16:36.963 --> 00:16:38.331
[grunts]

00:16:38.398 --> 00:16:40.466
Boy, it was freezing over there.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.403
‐ Takechiyo, we need a ride
back to the northern mountains.

00:16:43.436 --> 00:16:44.905
‐ What?! Again?

00:16:44.938 --> 00:16:47.508
Um, I mean,
if it's for you, Lord Riku,

00:16:47.574 --> 00:16:49.643
then of course.
There's no problem at all.

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:51.244
‐ Ready, Miss Tamano?

00:16:51.277 --> 00:16:52.412
‐ Oh, yes.

00:16:52.445 --> 00:16:53.614
‐ [yells]

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.685
‐ If they find out
about you two,

00:16:58.752 --> 00:17:00.420
it'll be disastrous for me.

00:17:00.453 --> 00:17:03.156
I can't allow you
to leave here alive!

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.595
Homura!

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:11.965
[both yell]

00:17:11.998 --> 00:17:14.167
‐ Anyone keeping
Tamano and I apart

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.969
Will be sent to the next life!

00:17:16.002 --> 00:17:18.271
‐ You re the one
who tore us apart!

00:17:18.304 --> 00:17:20.340
‐ Cyclone Burst!

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:22.175
‐ [yells]

00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:24.678
‐ Do you really think

00:17:24.678 --> 00:17:26.847
that's all it'll take
to defeat me?!

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.550
[yells]

00:17:32.352 --> 00:17:33.554
‐ It's too fast!
‐ [gasps]

00:17:34.688 --> 00:17:35.889
‐ Crimson Dragon Wave!
‐ [dragon roars]

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:41.895
‐ Moroha!
‐ [laughs]

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:49.970
We can't let that consume us.

00:17:50.003 --> 00:17:51.538
Let's retreat for now.

00:17:51.538 --> 00:17:55.308
‐ No way. I have to defeat
Homura no matter what.

00:17:55.341 --> 00:17:57.844
He's the reason
I lost Setsuna for so long!

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:00.914
‐ Towa.

00:18:00.981 --> 00:18:03.216
MOROHA:
Then make sure you dodge it.

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:04.551
Here it comes!

00:18:04.551 --> 00:18:07.888
‐ This time,
I'll turn you all into ash!

00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:09.255
TAMANO: Lord Homura,

00:18:09.322 --> 00:18:10.557
‐ please stop!
‐ [gasps]

00:18:10.557 --> 00:18:12.392
‐ Tamano.

00:18:12.392 --> 00:18:13.560
Tamano, is that you?

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.762
‐ Lord Homura, stop this now!

00:18:15.829 --> 00:18:17.931
These girls aren't involved!

00:18:17.998 --> 00:18:19.900
‐ I don't care about that!

00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:22.669
I demand you tell me
who the hell that man is!

‐ What?! Damn you, bastard!

00:18:26.907 --> 00:18:29.676
‐ Hey, you're gonna make him
even angrier!

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:33.013
‐ Well, then, Miss Tamano,
do you think it would be best

00:18:33.046 --> 00:18:35.582
for you to return to his side
at this point?

00:18:35.616 --> 00:18:38.251
‐ I don't. Truly,
I will never return to him!

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:39.553
‐ [squeals]

00:18:39.586 --> 00:18:42.455
B‐But Tamano,
why would you say such a thing?

00:18:42.523 --> 00:18:44.858
‐ [scoffs]
‐ Because I mean it!

00:18:44.891 --> 00:18:47.694
I don't want to live with you!
I want to be on my own,

00:18:47.728 --> 00:18:50.430
so I will never return to you!

00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:51.698
‐ [wails]

00:18:51.732 --> 00:18:54.601
‐ Yeah! Tell him, Miss Tamano.

00:18:54.635 --> 00:18:56.402
‐ Did she risk her life

00:18:56.436 --> 00:18:59.272
just so she could come here
and say that?

00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:02.275
All so she could
break up with him.

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:05.311
‐ Tell me, what has
happened to you, Tamano?

00:19:05.378 --> 00:19:07.714
I can't believe
that anyone has the power

00:19:07.748 --> 00:19:09.449
to tear our love apart.

00:19:09.449 --> 00:19:12.418
I'm sure you've been swayed
by that treacherous man.

00:19:12.452 --> 00:19:13.654
Tamano, come back.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.922
Please, you have to come back!

00:19:15.956 --> 00:19:17.924
‐ Your choice. Will you return?

00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:20.326
‐ I won't,
and that's the end of it!

00:19:20.393 --> 00:19:22.495
‐ Tamano.

00:19:22.563 --> 00:19:24.497
[sobs]

00:19:24.565 --> 00:19:27.634
Why? Why would you say that?

00:19:27.668 --> 00:19:30.303
I love you
more than anything in the world!

00:19:30.336 --> 00:19:32.405
Don't you understand that?

00:19:32.438 --> 00:19:36.309
Don't you know
how much I love you?!

00:19:41.582 --> 00:19:43.083
Careful now.

‐ Thank you.

00:19:44.585 --> 00:19:46.520
‐ Don't touch her!

00:19:46.587 --> 00:19:49.322
‐ Tamano is mine and mine alone!

00:19:49.355 --> 00:19:51.324
No one loves her
more than I do!

00:19:51.357 --> 00:19:53.760
Tamano! Tamano!

00:19:53.794 --> 00:19:56.963

‐ [wailing]

00:20:06.607 --> 00:20:08.041
‐ Hey, guys, is it just me,

00:20:08.108 --> 00:20:09.976
or is he trying
to burn himself up?

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:10.977
‐ [gasps]

00:20:11.011 --> 00:20:13.980

We have to get out of here now!

00:20:32.132 --> 00:20:33.800

‐ Hmm.

00:20:44.044 --> 00:20:46.713
RIKU: How utterly absurd.

00:20:46.713 --> 00:20:49.583
Nothing good ever comes
from loving a human being,

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:52.553
not for the Great Dog‐Demon,

00:20:52.553 --> 00:20:54.154
nor for Sesshomaru...

00:20:54.187 --> 00:20:57.023
only destruction.

for all of your help.

MOROHA: And if you need a lift,
Takechiyo's got you covered.

00:21:04.765 --> 00:21:06.032
‐ You can't offer that!

00:21:06.066 --> 00:21:08.869
But really, it would be
no problem for me whatsoever.

00:21:08.902 --> 00:21:11.572
‐ No, thank you.
I'll be alright.

00:21:11.605 --> 00:21:12.773
‐ Now you can go home

00:21:12.839 --> 00:21:15.108
and live peacefully
with your grandparents again.

00:21:15.175 --> 00:21:17.077
‐ You're right.
Which reminds me,

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.880
I should probably get going.
They must be worried.

00:21:19.913 --> 00:21:22.916
‐ Well, everybody,
take care of yourselves.

00:21:25.118 --> 00:21:27.854
‐ I still can't believe
that Homura.

00:21:27.888 --> 00:21:29.455
The bastard got so angry

00:21:29.523 --> 00:21:32.726
that he burned himself
into a big old pile of ash.

00:21:32.759 --> 00:21:35.729
And his bounty went up
in smoke with him, too!

00:21:35.762 --> 00:21:38.198
‐ That's pretty tragic, Moroha.

I think I'm done
walking around with this.

00:21:46.139 --> 00:21:48.775
It's not as though
I can contact anyone,

00:21:48.809 --> 00:21:51.612
and I have Setsuna
right here with me.

00:21:51.645 --> 00:21:53.113
Eh? What's wrong?

00:21:53.146 --> 00:21:55.115

[no audible dialogue]

00:21:57.884 --> 00:22:00.621

Never mind then.

I was going to give this to her.
