It doesn't sound like
it's an apparition.

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:15.589
Could it be like a shikigami
or maybe a puppet?

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:17.591
‐ It might be.

00:04:17.691 --> 00:04:19.926

‐ The problem's your Hiraikotsu.

‐ I haven't told you this,

00:05:09.075 --> 00:05:11.778
but your mother went up against
a bone‐eating demon once.

‐ Bone‐eating?

00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:16.116
‐ She warned me
that this type of demon

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:19.820
is capable of devouring weapons
such as the Hiraikotsu.

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:22.989
‐ You said before that the demon
appears by the river at night?

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.990
‐ Yes.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.492
‐ Fine. I will slay it.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.994
‐ Let's do our best, Setsuna.

00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:30.564

Corpse Dealer Jyubei?

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:22.048
This one gave me
a hard time, you know.

00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:25.952
‐ Where'd you disappear to these
past few days anyway, Moroha?

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:27.954
You're not trying
to run away, are you?

00:06:28.021 --> 00:06:30.123
‐ [laughs] 'Course not!

you still owe me.

00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:37.564
I'll pay it back soon.

00:06:37.631 --> 00:06:40.066
‐ Don't think you're
getting out of your promise.

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:42.569
I'm the one that has
to shoulder that debt of yours.

want me to starve to death!

Uh, flea demon?

00:06:56.216 --> 00:06:58.251
I know it's been
a while, Lady Moroha,

00:06:58.318 --> 00:07:00.020
but don't you think
it's a bit cruel

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:02.488
for you to sell off
your loyal servant like this?

Well, better
make that five mon.

00:07:12.566 --> 00:07:15.536
‐ Come on! Don't be like that!
Back when I brought you Tokotsu,

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:18.572
you gave me a whole bag of
silver for him, so what gives?

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:21.107
‐ Yeah, that headless Tokotsu.

00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:24.044
That beast and these scraps
just don't compare.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.614
In fact, if you had brought me
Tokotsu's head, too,

00:07:27.714 --> 00:07:29.182
I would have paid you
with a bag of gold.

00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:33.086
Besides, that bag of silver
was actually more of a deposit.

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:34.688
‐ Wait. What?

00:07:34.755 --> 00:07:36.590
‐ If you don't
bring me the head,

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:39.025

that deposit back.

I need you to stay on her tail

00:07:49.035 --> 00:07:50.904

has been going around,
gathering bones

00:07:57.711 --> 00:07:59.312
in order
to bring back his father.

00:07:59.379 --> 00:08:01.882
Moroha, you're gonna
want to take him out

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:03.216
before he gets the chance,

00:08:03.283 --> 00:08:04.985

I guess
what I meant to say is, uh...

00:08:38.418 --> 00:08:39.753
I'm sorry.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.155
‐ Stop apologizing!
It's annoying.

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:44.190

this is the darkest night

00:09:45.852 --> 00:09:47.420
‐ No. Looks like he escaped.

00:09:47.487 --> 00:09:49.756
‐ Oh, good!
I mean, it would be terrible

00:09:49.856 --> 00:09:51.758
if we killed
such a cute kid, you know?

00:09:51.825 --> 00:09:54.728
‐ You still spew such nonsense?

00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:56.096
‐ [gasps]
‐ Hey, see that?

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.733
The shards of bones keep going.

00:10:00.834 --> 00:10:01.835
‐ We'll find his nest

00:10:01.902 --> 00:10:03.036
at the end of this trail.

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:09.442
‐ [grunts]

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.913
OK, Takechiyo,
this shouldn't take me too long.

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:14.447
Go find a safe spot to wait.

00:10:14.515 --> 00:10:16.349
‐ Don't you take off,

00:10:16.416 --> 00:10:20.120
because I'm gonna be keeping
a close eye on you, Moroha!

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:23.456
[twig snaps]

00:10:23.524 --> 00:10:25.258
‐ [grunts]

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:26.860
Uh...[winces]

00:10:26.927 --> 00:10:29.129
‐ Moroha?

00:10:29.195 --> 00:10:30.797
‐ Hey, is that you, Towa?

00:10:30.864 --> 00:10:32.198
Oh, what's up, Setsuna?

00:10:32.265 --> 00:10:33.967
[gasps] Wait a minute.

00:10:34.034 --> 00:10:36.970
You two better not be here to
try and swipe my bounty again.

00:10:37.037 --> 00:10:39.405
‐ So your prey's here
as well, Moroha?

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:41.141
‐ Like I would tell you.

00:10:41.207 --> 00:10:43.744
I mean, come on. This one's
worth a whole bag of gold.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.145
‐ A bag of gold?

00:10:45.245 --> 00:10:47.380
‐ Boing! Boing! Ahem!

00:10:47.447 --> 00:10:50.216
Lady Moroha,
as one of the Four Perils,

00:10:50.283 --> 00:10:53.954
Tokotsu's head is worth far more
than a mere bag of gold!

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:55.956
He's worth
at least a gold ingot.

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:58.058
‐ Hey, shut up, will you?

00:10:58.124 --> 00:11:00.994
‐ The real problem
is the other Four Perils.

00:11:01.094 --> 00:11:03.797
It's a certainty
they won't be silent for long.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.066
‐ Yeah, you're right.

00:11:06.132 --> 00:11:09.169
<i>But if I get them involved,</i>
<i>things might just work out.</i>

00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:12.005
‐ <i>What are you scheming, Moroha?</i>

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.512
‐ Moroha the Demon Killer,

00:11:18.579 --> 00:11:21.181
soon I'll take
my revenge against you!

00:11:24.585 --> 00:11:27.353
‐ Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm Myoga,

00:11:27.453 --> 00:11:29.956
and I've had the honor
of serving the Great Dog‐Demon

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:32.425
and his family
for three generations.

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:35.161
And I must say,
Lady Moroha's blood

00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:38.198
is the closest
to the Great Dog‐Demon's by far.

00:11:38.298 --> 00:11:41.502
Why, it's even more delicious
than Master Inuyasha's!

00:11:41.602 --> 00:11:44.037
Would you stop
going on about that, already?

00:11:44.137 --> 00:11:46.172
I need you to tell me
about the Four Perils.

00:11:46.272 --> 00:11:48.174
‐ The Four Perils were demons

00:11:48.274 --> 00:11:49.876
that crossed over
from the mainland

00:11:49.976 --> 00:11:51.612
during the Spring
and Autumn period.

00:11:51.645 --> 00:11:55.882
Konton, Totetsu,
Kyuki, and Tokotsu,

00:11:55.982 --> 00:11:58.484
these four beasts
made up the roster.

00:11:58.552 --> 00:12:01.387
And the one who ruled over them
was Kirinmaru,

00:12:01.487 --> 00:12:05.125
a Beast King similar in power
to the Great Dog‐Demon.

00:12:05.158 --> 00:12:06.459
‐ [gasps]
‐ Wait a minute.

00:12:06.492 --> 00:12:08.228
Did you just say, "Kirinmaru"?

00:12:08.328 --> 00:12:10.063
‐ Yes, that's right.

00:12:10.163 --> 00:12:12.332
Why do you ask?
Have you heard of him before?

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:16.202
‐ Yes. We were told Kirinmaru
is attempting to distort time

00:12:16.302 --> 00:12:18.539
and swallow this world
into a Degenerate Age.

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:21.007
‐ Well, I find it
hard to believe

00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:25.045
that such a valiant Beast King
would hold such dark ambitions.

00:12:25.145 --> 00:12:26.547
[both grunt]

00:12:26.647 --> 00:12:29.149
‐ Father, can you hear me?

00:12:29.182 --> 00:12:31.552
O Great Father, it is time.

00:12:33.219 --> 00:12:35.021
Lord Tokotsu, the moment

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:37.524
of your grand awakening
has come at last!

00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:41.662
‐ I gotta be honest.

00:12:41.695 --> 00:12:44.030
Tokotsu being
Kirinmaru's underling

00:12:44.064 --> 00:12:46.199
was a twist
that I wasn't expecting.

00:12:46.232 --> 00:12:47.601
‐ Now what? [giggles]
‐ Wait.

00:12:47.701 --> 00:12:49.369
Are you trying
to rope us into this?

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:51.271
‐ Aw, come on. Say yes,

00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:53.607
and I'll help you find
that Dream Butterfly of yours.

00:12:53.707 --> 00:12:55.375
‐ Hmph! That's not worth it.

00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:58.378
‐ I guess you must be
super strong, huh, Moroha?

00:12:58.411 --> 00:13:00.514
You took out one
of the Four Perils all alone.

00:13:00.547 --> 00:13:02.382
‐ Uh...[laughs]

00:13:02.415 --> 00:13:05.552
Thing is, I don't remember
slaying Tokotsu. [chuckles]

00:13:05.586 --> 00:13:07.521
‐ What do you mean?

00:13:07.554 --> 00:13:10.223
‐ For the life of me,
I don't have any memory

00:13:10.256 --> 00:13:12.058
of what went on
during the fight.

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:13.527
The only thing I do remember

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.030
is deciding to take his
precious Red Pearl for myself.

00:13:17.063 --> 00:13:19.733
Well, that, and when I was
transporting his corpse,

00:13:19.766 --> 00:13:23.303
his cronies chased after me,
so I ran my ass off to lose 'em!

00:13:23.403 --> 00:13:25.371
‐ [yelling]
‐ At the time,

00:13:25.405 --> 00:13:27.608
I didn't even know
he was worth a bag of silver

00:13:27.708 --> 00:13:29.543
or that his name was Tokotsu

00:13:29.576 --> 00:13:31.277
until I talked
to the corpse dealer,

00:13:31.377 --> 00:13:33.246
Jyubei, who filled me in later.

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:35.048
[nervous laugh]

00:13:35.081 --> 00:13:36.983
‐ You're saying
all that dumb luck

00:13:37.083 --> 00:13:39.219
just fell right into your lap?

00:13:39.252 --> 00:13:40.420
‐ That's one way to put it.

00:13:40.486 --> 00:13:42.122
‐ That means you weren't the one

00:13:42.222 --> 00:13:44.057
who killed Tokotsu after all.

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:46.993
‐ You see? If anyone's
the victim here, it's me.

00:13:47.093 --> 00:13:49.462
‐ You're missing the point.
If we proceed,

00:13:49.563 --> 00:13:51.598
we'll be following
the Tree of Ages' request.

00:13:51.632 --> 00:13:52.599
‐ You're right.

00:13:52.633 --> 00:13:54.267
‐ If we defeat the Four Perils,

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.069
Kirinmaru will emerge.

00:13:56.102 --> 00:13:58.972
And if that happened,
we know what would follow.

00:13:59.072 --> 00:14:00.406
‐ Sesshomaru.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.143
We would have no choice
but to fight our own father.

00:14:03.243 --> 00:14:05.612
‐ Did I hear correctly?
Are those two

00:14:05.646 --> 00:14:07.781
truly the daughters
of Lord Sesshomaru?

00:14:07.814 --> 00:14:09.249
‐ Looks like it.

00:14:12.252 --> 00:14:13.987
‐ So what'll it be?

00:14:14.087 --> 00:14:16.189
Kirinmaru's underling,
one of the Four Perils,

00:14:16.289 --> 00:14:18.024
is on the other side
of this door,

00:14:18.124 --> 00:14:19.459
and he's worth a gold ingot.

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:21.127
Come on.

00:14:21.161 --> 00:14:23.429
I say we split the bounty
three ways. Sound good?

00:14:23.463 --> 00:14:25.198
We're pretty much buddies
after all the stuff

00:14:25.298 --> 00:14:26.499
we went through in the future,

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.602
so let's keep on
helping each other out.

00:14:28.635 --> 00:14:30.303
What do you say?!

00:14:30.336 --> 00:14:31.337
[all gasp]

00:14:31.437 --> 00:14:32.338
‐ Hello, ladies.

00:14:32.438 --> 00:14:34.007
I humbly bid you welcome.

00:14:34.107 --> 00:14:36.777
My father Tokotsu
will be delighted to see you.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.479
‐ Don't let your guard down,
alright, you two?

00:14:39.513 --> 00:14:41.682
‐ But you're the one
who should be on guard, not us.

00:14:41.782 --> 00:14:43.449
‐ Huh?
‐ Lest you forget,

00:14:43.483 --> 00:14:46.186
he believes you're responsible
for murdering his father.

00:14:46.286 --> 00:14:47.287
‐ Guess that's true.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.155
‐ Why don't we explain to him

00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:51.124
that the whole situation
was dumb luck?

00:14:51.157 --> 00:14:52.492
I'm sure he'll understand that.

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:54.227
We can even return the money.

00:14:54.327 --> 00:14:55.295
There's no need to fight‐‐

00:14:55.328 --> 00:14:56.563
‐ What are you, stupid?!

00:14:56.663 --> 00:14:59.199
If a bounty hunter
returns her bounty,

00:14:59.299 --> 00:15:01.668
then she's not
a bounty hunter anymore!

00:15:06.172 --> 00:15:08.341
If you wanna avenge your dad,

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:10.076
I'm happy to send you to him!

00:15:10.176 --> 00:15:11.678
‐ [laughs]

00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:12.679
‐ [gasps]

00:15:15.582 --> 00:15:16.517
[both gasp]

00:15:18.552 --> 00:15:20.587
‐ You'll send him to me,
will you?

00:15:20.687 --> 00:15:22.556
There's no need,
for I am right here.

00:15:22.656 --> 00:15:24.057
‐ Father.

00:15:24.157 --> 00:15:25.425
‐ Not only did you wrong me

00:15:25.526 --> 00:15:27.360
by stealing
my treasured Red Pearl

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:28.862
and hampering my power,

00:15:28.895 --> 00:15:32.566
but you have insulted me
by selling off my body as well!

00:15:32.666 --> 00:15:34.768
I will not forgive you, wretch.

00:15:34.868 --> 00:15:36.402
‐ Stop it, will you?

00:15:36.503 --> 00:15:37.838
You're being really harsh!

00:15:37.871 --> 00:15:40.206
You make it sound
like I'm the bad guy.

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:41.441
‐ She is, isn't she?

00:15:41.542 --> 00:15:42.709
‐ She sure is.

00:15:42.743 --> 00:15:45.345
‐ I'll reclaim my Red Pearl

00:15:45.378 --> 00:15:49.583
and rip your head
from your body, as was my fate!

00:15:49.683 --> 00:15:50.884
[both gasp]

00:15:50.917 --> 00:15:52.118
‐ [laughs]

00:15:52.218 --> 00:15:53.787
You're slipping, Tokotsu.

00:15:53.887 --> 00:15:56.089
You can't be
a member of the Four Perils

00:15:56.189 --> 00:15:57.524
with only your skull.

00:15:57.558 --> 00:15:59.459
That's karma for you.
So give up, already!

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.228
‐ Hold up, Moroha.
Just apologize.

00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:04.464
Everyone makes mistakes,
so just own up to it.

00:16:04.565 --> 00:16:06.733
‐ How naive.
Back in your world,

00:16:06.767 --> 00:16:09.202
does a simple apology
buy you forgiveness?

00:16:09.235 --> 00:16:10.571
‐ Enough, already!

00:16:10.604 --> 00:16:12.906
Apologizing will do you
little good at this point!

00:16:12.939 --> 00:16:14.708
‐ Oh, I wasn't gonna.

00:16:14.741 --> 00:16:17.477
I'm a bounty hunter.
This comes with the territory.

00:16:17.578 --> 00:16:19.813
I'll just have
to power my way through!

00:16:19.913 --> 00:16:23.483
‐ Crimson Dragon Wave!
‐ [dragon roars]

00:16:23.584 --> 00:16:25.151
‐ [roars]

00:16:25.251 --> 00:16:26.419
‐ No. Father!

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:27.821
‐ So this is your path.

00:16:27.921 --> 00:16:30.624
I expect nothing less
from my companion.

00:16:30.724 --> 00:16:33.426
Hah! Cyclone Burst!

00:16:37.631 --> 00:16:39.633
‐ Setsuna.

00:16:39.733 --> 00:16:41.401
[gasps]

00:16:41.434 --> 00:16:43.436
‐ <i>How naive. Back in your world,</i>

00:16:43.504 --> 00:16:45.906
<i>does a simple apology</i>
<i>buy you forgiveness?</i>

00:16:45.939 --> 00:16:47.574
‐ <i>She's right.</i>

00:16:47.608 --> 00:16:50.276
<i>You can't resolve everything</i>
<i>with apologies.</i>

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:51.678
[yells]

00:16:51.778 --> 00:16:53.647
Setsuna!

00:16:53.747 --> 00:16:54.648
Moroha!

00:16:54.748 --> 00:16:56.182
I'll fight, too!

00:16:57.283 --> 00:16:58.919
'K, no need to hesitate

00:16:58.952 --> 00:17:00.587
when I'm dealing with skeletons.

00:17:00.621 --> 00:17:02.488
Can't kill what's already dead.

00:17:02.589 --> 00:17:03.624
‐ [growls]

00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.861
I'll rip all your bones out!

00:17:07.961 --> 00:17:09.362
‐ [grunts]

00:17:09.462 --> 00:17:10.931
‐ [blows]
‐ [groans]

00:17:10.964 --> 00:17:13.199
[gasps] What?

00:17:13.299 --> 00:17:16.637
[chuckles] I had a little
purification salt in my mouth.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:18.471
‐ Damn you. But how?

00:17:18.505 --> 00:17:22.308
A demon like you shouldn't be
able to possess spirit powers.

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:25.546
[Myoga laughs] I believe
I can explain that part.

00:17:25.646 --> 00:17:27.681
‐ What? Who's there?
Show yourself!

00:17:27.781 --> 00:17:29.816
‐ Right here!
Boing! Boing! Boing!

00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:32.653
‐ Hey, Grandpa Myoga.
‐ Boing! Boing! Ahem!

00:17:32.686 --> 00:17:35.321
Lady Moroha
is the daughter of Kagome,

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:37.991
the reincarnation of
the legendary priestess Kikyo,

00:17:38.024 --> 00:17:40.661
who was skilled
in the purification of evil.

00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:43.830
It's only natural she would be
equipped with spirit powers.

00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:47.668
‐ What? The daughter
of Kikyo's reincarnation?

00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:50.336
But doesn't that make them
pretty much unrelated?

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:51.505
‐ You be quiet!

00:17:51.572 --> 00:17:52.806
‐ Grandpa Myoga!

00:17:52.839 --> 00:17:54.575
I'm surprised
you haven't run away.

00:17:54.675 --> 00:17:56.342
‐ [laughs] I was about to,

00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:58.845
but then I thought it was
almost time for you know what.

00:17:58.879 --> 00:18:00.547
‐ Yup. You guessed it.

00:18:00.647 --> 00:18:01.882
It's time!

00:18:01.982 --> 00:18:03.550
MYOGA: Hoo hoo hoo!

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.218
I get to taste my master's blood

00:18:05.318 --> 00:18:06.853
for the first time
in 200 years!

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.389
‐ Uh, wait. I almost forgot.

00:18:09.489 --> 00:18:11.825
If I go ahead and do this...

00:18:11.858 --> 00:18:12.859
Right.

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:14.695
Towa, Setsuna. I'm gonna be out

00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:17.497
for a whole day after this,
so watch my back, 'K?

00:18:17.531 --> 00:18:19.866
‐ Huh? Wait. What do you mean?

00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:21.502
‐ You're so troublesome.

00:18:21.535 --> 00:18:22.869
‐ [chuckles]

00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:25.371
OK, here goes!
With this rouge...

00:18:28.709 --> 00:18:32.378
I become Beniyasha,
the Destroyer of Lands.

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:34.881
Tremble before
the bloodthirsty dawn!

00:18:34.948 --> 00:18:37.383
Bear witness to your end
if you so dare!

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.886
‐ This rouge was a gift
from the Great Dog‐Demon

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.788
to his wife, Lady Izayoi.

00:18:41.888 --> 00:18:44.290
Whenever Lady Moroha
applies the rouge,

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.426
his memories
are immediately revived

00:18:46.527 --> 00:18:48.028
in her delicious blood!

00:18:48.061 --> 00:18:49.896
It can't be beat!

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:50.964
Thank you for the meal!

00:18:51.064 --> 00:18:53.600
Now time for me
to flee the scene!

00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:56.703
‐ [gasps]

00:18:56.737 --> 00:18:59.305
‐ Jakotsumaru,
do not let your guard down.

00:18:59.405 --> 00:19:03.276
My body was taken from me
by those devilish claws of hers!

00:19:03.376 --> 00:19:05.045
‐ How dare you, Beniyasha!

00:19:05.078 --> 00:19:07.914
‐ [yells]

00:19:07.948 --> 00:19:10.416
‐ [scoffs]

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:11.484
[laughs]

00:19:11.585 --> 00:19:13.654
Iron‐Reaver, Soul‐Stealer!

00:19:15.589 --> 00:19:19.660
‐ [screams]

00:19:21.094 --> 00:19:24.297
‐ Aww. That poor kid.

00:19:24.397 --> 00:19:25.298
‐ Damn you!

00:19:25.398 --> 00:19:26.667
You killed Jakotsumaru!

00:19:26.767 --> 00:19:27.768
‐ [yelps]

00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:29.002
[gasps]

00:19:29.102 --> 00:19:30.937
‐ [roars]

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:34.407
‐ [growls] Blades of Blood!

00:19:35.809 --> 00:19:37.778
‐ [roaring]

00:19:40.446 --> 00:19:42.315
‐ Wow, she's amazing!

00:19:42.415 --> 00:19:44.350
‐ No, not really.
Just look at her.

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:46.352
‐ [snoring]
‐ [gasps]

00:19:46.452 --> 00:19:48.655
‐ She used up her demon power.

00:19:48.755 --> 00:19:51.592
‐ So she only lasts
about a minute, huh?

00:19:51.625 --> 00:19:53.927
Instant noodles
take longer than that.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.996
‐ Curse you.
‐ [gasps]

00:19:56.096 --> 00:19:58.532
He's still alive?!

00:19:58.632 --> 00:20:00.967
‐ So this is what she meant
by watching her back.

00:20:01.001 --> 00:20:02.536
Guess there's no choice!

00:20:02.636 --> 00:20:04.938
Scourge of Swallows!

00:20:08.675 --> 00:20:10.143
‐ [roars]

00:20:13.446 --> 00:20:15.682
‐ Are you really sure
we want to finish him off?

00:20:15.782 --> 00:20:17.684
We were the ones
in the wrong here.

00:20:17.784 --> 00:20:20.453
‐ Towa, don't forget.
If you hesitate,

00:20:20.486 --> 00:20:23.356
we'll find more of those
boneless corpses out there.

00:20:23.456 --> 00:20:25.491
‐ Oh, yeah.
When you put it like that,

00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:27.393
I guess they're
way worse than we are.

00:20:27.493 --> 00:20:28.562
Alright, then.

00:20:28.662 --> 00:20:31.698
‐ Tokotsu,
it's nothing personal.

00:20:31.798 --> 00:20:33.567
Meet an arhat,
then slay the arhat.

00:20:33.667 --> 00:20:35.736
Meet your parents,
then slay your parents.

00:20:37.137 --> 00:20:39.840
Know that the light
to your path lies therein.

00:20:41.041 --> 00:20:44.077
Villain Tokotsu
of the Four Perils,

00:20:44.177 --> 00:20:45.546
rest in peace!

00:21:05.699 --> 00:21:08.935
Master Jyubei, they destroyed
everything out here,

00:21:09.035 --> 00:21:10.937
including the Red Bone Palace!

00:21:11.037 --> 00:21:13.840
JYUBEI: <i>Even Tokotsu</i>
<i>and Jakotsumaru?</i>

00:21:13.874 --> 00:21:15.942
‐ Yup. They're completely gone.

00:21:16.042 --> 00:21:18.444
‐ <i>Well done,</i>
<i>Half‐Demon Princesses.</i>

00:21:18.545 --> 00:21:22.182
<i>Too bad having no remains left</i>
<i>means I can't give a bounty.</i>

00:21:22.215 --> 00:21:24.718
‐ I guess that means
the profits go to us, huh?

00:21:24.751 --> 00:21:26.186
‐ <i>My thoughts, exactly.</i>

00:21:26.219 --> 00:21:27.721
<i>Come on back.</i>

00:21:27.788 --> 00:21:29.022
‐ Yes, sir!

00:21:34.194 --> 00:21:36.730
‐ [snoring]

00:21:36.763 --> 00:21:40.100
‐ Hey, Setsuna, what was that
you whispered earlier?

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:43.970
‐ Long ago, I heard
a traveling monk say it.

00:21:46.106 --> 00:21:48.074
It just crossed my mind.

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:51.077
‐ There's really nothing left.

00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:54.080
Looks like we won't
be getting that bounty.

00:21:54.147 --> 00:21:57.751
‐ Probably not.
‐ [mutters] Gold.

00:21:57.784 --> 00:22:01.588
<i>‐ A quarter‐demon possessing</i>
<i>both spirit and demon powers.</i>

00:22:01.655 --> 00:22:04.490
‐ [snoring]
‐ <i>How interesting.</i>

00:22:11.998 --> 00:22:13.934
[Japanese music playing]

00:23:43.056 --> 00:23:45.659
TOWA: <i>The corpse dealer Jyubei</i>
<i>is charging the three of us</i>

00:23:45.692 --> 00:23:47.661
<i>with solving a case</i>
<i>about missing travelers.</i>

00:23:47.694 --> 00:23:50.864
<i>We find a mysterious village</i>
<i>full of cats.</i>

00:23:50.897 --> 00:23:52.866
SETSUNA: <i>The whole village</i>
<i>smells of demon.</i>

00:23:52.933 --> 00:23:55.869
TOWA: <i>At the old temple in this</i>
<i>ghost cat infested village</i>

00:23:55.936 --> 00:23:58.238
<i>lives a man who looks</i>
<i>exactly like Julian,</i>

00:23:58.338 --> 00:24:00.340
<i>who happens to be</i>
<i>Mei's favorite idol.</i>

00:24:00.373 --> 00:24:03.043
JUAN: <i>Do you have</i>
<i>some business at this temple?</i>

00:24:03.076 --> 00:24:05.278
You can call me Juan.

00:24:05.378 --> 00:24:06.713
TOWA: Next on Yashahime,

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.381
