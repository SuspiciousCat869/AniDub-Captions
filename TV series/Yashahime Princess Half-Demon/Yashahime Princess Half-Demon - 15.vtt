00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:09.275
RIKU: Hello there.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.346
Let me tell you a story,
one that began 18 years ago.

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:17.250
For me, however, it might
as well have been yesterday.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:20.320
‐ Behold.

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:21.655
Isn't it glorious?

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:25.125
‐ So this is the Black Pearl,
the jewel that leads

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:27.761
to the border of this world
and the afterlife.

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:30.430
‐ Normally it would have
taken a hundred years,

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:33.133
but I was able
to create it in just four,

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.301
and it's thanks to you,
Lord Riku,

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:37.638
for lending me
your Rainbow Pearl

00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:39.372
and Lady Izayoi's rouge.

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:42.175
‐ I was just happy
to be of assistance.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.377
So tell me, what do you
intend to do with that?

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:47.380
‐ I will deliver the jewel
to Sir Inuyasha.

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:50.617
‐ OK then. Could you
please give him this as well?

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:55.121
[insects chirping]

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:57.057
‐ [grunting]

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:02.328
Lady Kaede, I found yet
another remnant of Root Head.

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:04.831
‐ I see. Even after a month,

00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:07.233
we still can't be rid
of that thing.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.402
What a bothersome creature.

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:12.405
‐ We also saw a demon
at Doggy's place.

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:14.841
‐ Huh? You mean Inuyasha?

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:17.744
‐ No, a different one,
a shell demon.

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:19.546
‐ A shell demon?

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.248
HOSENKI: Sir Inuyasha, rejoice!

00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:24.417
The Black Pearl is complete!

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:28.254
And a whole 96 years
ahead of schedule, at that.

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:29.556
‐ Oh.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.592
‐ Tell me, Sir Inuyasha,

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:34.561
is the story about you
and my father true,

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:37.197
that you inherited his skill,
the Adamant Barrage?

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.733
‐ Oh! Yup, that's 100% true.

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.702
‐ I would love to see it.

00:01:41.735 --> 00:01:43.737
Even one time would suffice.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.572
If you could
demonstrate it for me,

00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:47.107
I would be more than happy

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:49.442
to hand this Black Pearl over
to you, good sir.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.678
‐ Well, if you really
wanna see it that badly,

00:01:51.712 --> 00:01:53.446
who am I to say no?

00:01:53.514 --> 00:01:57.584
Plus I do owe it to
the previous Hosenki after all.

00:01:57.618 --> 00:01:59.586
‐ Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.787
‐ Hey, wait a second!

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:03.924
‐ [grunts]

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:07.193
Adamant Barrage!

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:09.796
‐ Inuyasha! Sit, boy!

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:10.864
‐ [yelps]

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:13.399
‐ What were you thinking,
doing that here?

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:15.769
Did you even consider
your surroundings?

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:19.573
HOSENKI: Before his passing,
my father told me

00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:22.475
these were originally tears
from Lady Izayoi,

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:24.578
the wife of the Great Dog‐Demon.

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:26.747
‐ Hmm.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.782
The tears of my mother, huh?

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:31.484
‐ When the Great Dog‐Demon
passed away,

00:02:31.552 --> 00:02:34.487
Lady Izayoi's tears
were turned into a jewel.

00:02:34.555 --> 00:02:37.658
The Tessaiga, along with
the path to the Master's grave,

00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:39.259
were sealed inside it,

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:42.663
then placed within
young Sir Inuyasha's right eye.

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:45.165
‐ And this shell here,
what's it for?

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:48.502
‐ That is the very rouge
Lady Izayoi used.

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.838
To create the Black Pearl,
we required a semblance

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:54.608
of the profound sadness
that she possessed.

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:57.644
INUYASHA: I'm surprised
you were able to find that.

00:02:57.678 --> 00:02:59.445
‐ It was no easy feat.

00:03:00.514 --> 00:03:02.516
‐ Are you giving this
to us as well

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:04.284
along with the Black Pearl?

00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:05.652
‐ But of course.

00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:08.822
I have no use for it now that
the Black Pearl is complete.

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:11.191
‐ Isn't that great, Inuyasha?

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:13.527
Now we have
two of your mother's keepsakes.

00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:16.630
‐ Huh? Why the hell would I
need those things anymore?

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:18.765
‐ Oh, don't talk like that!

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.868
We can go pay respects to
your father's grave with this.

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:23.770
Why can't you be
happier about it?

00:03:23.804 --> 00:03:26.372
‐ Yeah, right, like that's
a place I'm dyin' to go.

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:27.307
‐ Hey!

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:30.877
‐ What have you just done?

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:33.947
Concealing it in your right eye
means you can't extract it

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.882
without taking drastic measures.

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.984
‐ Yeah?
Well, it was my mother's,

00:03:38.018 --> 00:03:39.520
so as far as I'm concerned,

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:41.522
I can do whatever the hell
I want with it.

00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:43.890
‐ Really, do you have to be
such a loose cannon?

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.392
I think it's best
that I hold on to this gift.

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.694
‐ [scoffs]

00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:51.565

<i>how he truly feels.</i>

[Japanese music playing]

00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:26.827
[Japanese music playing]

00:05:39.072 --> 00:05:41.908
TOWA: "Farewell
Under the Lunar Eclipse."

00:05:41.942 --> 00:05:43.009
[owl hoots]

00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:44.511
[footsteps shuffling]

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:46.747
GYOKUTO: Come on, Lady Kaede!

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.748
KIN'U: Hurry! Hurry!

00:05:47.781 --> 00:05:48.982
‐ Now, now, you two.

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.483
Don't rush me.

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:52.452
KIN'U: But Lady Rin's
gonna give birth soon!

00:05:52.485 --> 00:05:53.787
‐ You have to be there!

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.121
‐ Alright, alright.

00:05:55.155 --> 00:05:57.023
‐ Hope Hisui
doesn't get too jealous.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.826
‐ 'Cause we're gonna shower it
with so much love!

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.129
‐ Where is little Hisui and
your mother, for that matter?

00:06:03.163 --> 00:06:06.466
‐ Mother went
to go get Lady Kagome.

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:09.035
SANGO: It looks like
it'll be happening soon.

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.537
KAGOME: Right. I'm ready.

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:12.839
‐ How are you feeling, Kagome?

00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:15.441
‐ You're far along now.
I can't wait!

00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:18.879
‐ Thanks, Sango. I feel fine.

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:20.847
You can barely see my bump.

00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:22.448
‐ [chuckles] That's true.

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:25.051
Still, just try
to be careful, OK?

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:31.024
‐ Mother, Mother!
Can you come here?

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.959
‐ Lady Kaede
needs help with something!

00:06:32.993 --> 00:06:34.561
‐ Does she?

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:36.897
‐ Oh, don't worry about me.

00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:39.199
You go on ahead, and I'll
catch up with you all soon.

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:41.802
‐ OK, but don't
go pushing yourself.

00:06:41.835 --> 00:06:42.903
‐ Thanks.

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:44.871
[girls panting]

00:06:47.974 --> 00:06:49.142
[owl hoots]

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:52.546
‐ The moon is waning a bit.
That's odd.

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:55.081
I thought it was supposed to be
a full one tonight.

00:06:57.584 --> 00:07:01.421
Oh! The lunar eclipse
must be happening tonight.

00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:02.889
The moon becomes dark

00:07:02.923 --> 00:07:05.692
as the Earth's shadow
passes over it.

00:07:05.726 --> 00:07:06.927
‐ Lady Kagome.
‐ [gasps]

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:10.430
My name is Riku.

00:07:10.496 --> 00:07:12.599
‐ Oh. Hello.

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:14.868
I'm sorry.
Have I met you somewhere before?

00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:16.937
‐ No, this is our first time.

00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:19.573
‐ Then how is it
that you know who I am?

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:22.676
‐ "The legendary priestess
who made the right wish

00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:24.845
and purified the Shikon Jewel."

00:07:24.878 --> 00:07:27.781
Word of your noble deeds have
reached corners of the Earth

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:30.450
that you may not have thought
were even possible, my lady.

00:07:30.517 --> 00:07:33.787
‐ I see. So was there
something you needed?

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:37.190
‐ To warn you of
a great cataclysm approaching.

00:07:37.223 --> 00:07:42.062
Every 500 years, an object
known as the Grim Comet

00:07:42.095 --> 00:07:43.697
travels close to this Earth.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.699
‐ The Grim Comet?

00:07:45.732 --> 00:07:49.736
‐ Unfortunately, large fragments
start to break off

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.638
and descend from its core.

00:07:55.542 --> 00:07:56.910
500 years ago,

00:07:56.943 --> 00:07:59.980
back when nobles
were still governing this land,

00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:02.983
war and famine
continued to spread,

00:08:02.983 --> 00:08:04.818
costing many their lives.

00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:08.822
Because of that,
the demon race grew in numbers,

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:10.891
with powerful demons
who would rule them

00:08:10.924 --> 00:08:12.893
appearing in the East and West.

00:08:13.994 --> 00:08:16.229
You know one of them quite well,

00:08:16.262 --> 00:08:17.931
the Great Dog‐Demon.

00:08:17.964 --> 00:08:21.635
‐ Wait. Are you referring
to Inuyasha's father?

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:23.637
‐ Yes, that's correct.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.573
Him and Kirinmaru...

00:08:26.607 --> 00:08:28.942
these two Beast Kings
joined forces

00:08:28.975 --> 00:08:32.579
and destroyed the Comet's
fragment 500 years ago.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.949
‐ They destroyed a comet?

00:08:35.982 --> 00:08:37.083
I never knew.

00:08:37.117 --> 00:08:40.186
‐ Seven days from now,
history will be repeated

00:08:40.253 --> 00:08:43.657
as the Grim Comet's fragment
once again falls to Earth.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:47.661
Only, this time,
the Great Dog‐Demon is no more,

00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:50.864
and Kirinmaru
has entered a long slumber.

00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:53.867
‐ Will Inuyasha be able
to take his father's place?

00:08:53.934 --> 00:08:56.770
Is there a way for us
to awaken Kirinmaru?

00:08:56.803 --> 00:08:59.873
‐ I would strongly advise
against waking him.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.544
He hates humans
and abhors half‐demons as well.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.613
Not only would he kill
Lord Inuyasha,

00:09:06.647 --> 00:09:09.950
he would also very likely kill
the half‐demon child

00:09:09.983 --> 00:09:12.553
that Lady Rin
will give birth to tonight

00:09:12.619 --> 00:09:15.689
and of course
your unborn child as well.

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:19.192
‐ [gasps]
He'll try to kill my child?

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:20.894
Can't we do anything?!

00:09:20.961 --> 00:09:23.029
There must be a way
to keep him asleep

00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:24.798
while still
being able to destroy

00:09:24.831 --> 00:09:26.299
the fragment of the Grim Comet!

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:28.902
‐ There is one way.

00:09:28.969 --> 00:09:30.871
If the sons
of the Great Dog‐Demon

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:33.740
can combine their strength,
then maybe.

00:09:33.807 --> 00:09:35.909
‐ If there's anything
I can do to help,

00:09:35.976 --> 00:09:37.077
then I'll get it done.

00:09:37.143 --> 00:09:38.912
‐ Good. In that case,

00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:40.847
I would ask you
to convince your husband

00:09:40.881 --> 00:09:42.649
and Lord Sesshomaru
to join forces.

00:09:42.683 --> 00:09:45.085
‐ OK then. Just leave it to me.

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:48.154
[babies crying]

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:55.261
‐ Lord Sesshomaru,
I'm so happy for you.

00:09:55.328 --> 00:09:56.930
[crying continues]

00:09:59.065 --> 00:10:01.334
Huh? Who goes there?

00:10:01.367 --> 00:10:02.603
[mysterious music playing]

00:10:02.669 --> 00:10:05.606
‐ It's been a while,
Lord Sesshomaru.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.709
‐ And just who would you be?

00:10:08.742 --> 00:10:10.744
Come, state your business!

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:13.780
‐ How is your mother faring?

00:10:13.847 --> 00:10:16.349
‐ [scoffs]
I've not seen her in years.

00:10:16.382 --> 00:10:21.121
‐ I've been told you had twins,
half‐demon twins, at that.

00:10:22.856 --> 00:10:26.392
To think you, who despises
anything that's human,

00:10:26.426 --> 00:10:30.230
would willingly choose to take
a human woman for his wife.

00:10:30.263 --> 00:10:33.867
I can just picture the look
on Kirinmaru's face now.

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:37.237
Perhaps before he is awakened,

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.140
you should go and hide
your precious daughters.

00:10:40.206 --> 00:10:43.209
‐ Is it not you
who wants them dead, Zero?

00:10:43.243 --> 00:10:46.613
‐ My! How flattering
that you remembered my name.

00:10:53.119 --> 00:10:54.655
‐ A puppet?

00:10:54.721 --> 00:10:55.722
‐ Predictable.

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:58.458
ZERO: <i>Once the eclipse ends,</i>

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:00.160
<i>the Grim Comet will approach</i>

00:11:00.226 --> 00:11:03.129
<i>for the first time</i>
<i>in 500 years.</i>

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:05.832
<i>That's when you</i>
<i>should use your Bakusaiga.</i>

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:07.400
<i>It's your choice</i>

00:11:07.433 --> 00:11:11.471
<i>whether to heed my warning</i>
<i>or not, Lord Sesshomaru.</i>

00:11:11.505 --> 00:11:15.308
<i>As someone who was humiliated</i>
<i>by your father, however,</i>

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:18.011
<i>I'd be lying if I said</i>
<i>I didn't wish to see</i>

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:21.247
<i>your entire family</i>
<i>suffer in agony.</i>

00:11:21.281 --> 00:11:24.985
<i>Well, then,</i>
<i>best of luck to you.</i>

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:28.154
‐ Who does she think she is?

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:29.489
That‐‐Huh?

00:11:29.523 --> 00:11:31.024
[gasps] W‐Wait for me!

00:11:31.091 --> 00:11:32.859
[yells]

00:11:34.494 --> 00:11:36.963
KAEDE: You did splendidly, Rin.

00:11:36.997 --> 00:11:39.099
‐ Thank you so very much.

00:11:39.132 --> 00:11:42.202
‐ Look at them. They're both
just utterly adorable.

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:43.704
‐ Have you picked their names?

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:48.041
‐ Towa and Setsuna.

00:11:48.108 --> 00:11:50.343
‐ Towa and Setsuna.

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:53.780
Yes! Those sound
like perfect names for them.

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:57.684
‐ [gasps] Lord Sesshomaru!

00:12:01.822 --> 00:12:04.024
‐ Wait! What are you doing?

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:07.861
‐ Don't tell me that you're
taking them away somewhere.

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:10.196
‐ Sesshomaru,
what's going on here?

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.699
‐ A rite of courage
and cowardice.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.502
KAGOME: Hold on!

00:12:15.536 --> 00:12:16.903
Tell me.

00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:20.006
Are you doing this
because of Kirinmaru?

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.475
In order to destroy
the Grim Comet's fragment,

00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:26.079
I was told that we need help
from you and Inuyasha.

00:12:32.052 --> 00:12:36.489
‐ Lord Sesshomaru,
I have faith in you always.

00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:40.026
‐ Hey, Kagome.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.562
‐ Jaken?

00:12:41.595 --> 00:12:43.163
‐ I've written down for you

00:12:43.196 --> 00:12:46.900
here on this piece of parchment
when and where Lord Sesshomaru

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:49.402
plans to obliterate
the Comet fragment.

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:53.039
I'm sure Lord Sesshomaru can
fulfill this task on his own,

00:12:53.073 --> 00:12:56.176
but give Inuyasha
this info just in case.

00:12:56.209 --> 00:12:58.111
‐ Understood. I'll do that.

00:12:58.178 --> 00:13:00.246
‐ Master Jaken.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.750
‐ Yes.
Just leave the rest to me.

00:13:05.385 --> 00:13:07.120
‐ [gasps] Ah.

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:10.924
Zero sends her regards.

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:14.961
I'll be taking those half‐demon
whelps off your hands now!

00:13:17.197 --> 00:13:19.099
‐ [wailing]

00:13:26.873 --> 00:13:28.542
‐ I see. Rainbow Pearls.

00:13:28.575 --> 00:13:30.243
‐ Give those back!

00:13:30.276 --> 00:13:32.946
They're the jewels
of the Ka Demon Tribe!

00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:34.447
‐ You're wrong.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.150
These here are Zero's tears.

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:53.900
‐ I solemnly pledge
that I, Jaken,

00:13:53.934 --> 00:13:57.170
will care for and raise
these girls in Rin's place.

00:14:02.943 --> 00:14:05.846
Jaken, Jaken!

00:14:05.912 --> 00:14:07.013
Come forth, barrier,

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.015
and make yourself known!

00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:20.627
The spell is complete, My Lord.

00:14:20.661 --> 00:14:23.496
Next, I shall bring Rin
to this place as well.

00:14:42.348 --> 00:14:43.517
‐ Hmph.

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.351
‐ I can't sense the presence

00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:47.320
of those half‐demon twins
anywhere.

00:14:47.353 --> 00:14:49.956
They must have been sealed
inside a barrier.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.892
There's no other explanation.

00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:55.128
‐ As expected from Sesshomaru.

00:15:03.336 --> 00:15:07.373
‐ [grunts] This palace
belongs to My Lord's mother.

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:09.676
But it doesn't look
like she's home,

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:12.045
which is a great relief.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:18.552
[wind blowing]

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:21.655
‐ It's here.
‐ Hmph.

00:15:27.694 --> 00:15:30.063
[dramatic music playing]

00:15:36.402 --> 00:15:38.204
‐ Bakusaiga!

00:15:43.677 --> 00:15:45.345
I'll leave the rest to you.

00:15:45.378 --> 00:15:47.581
‐ I don't need your permission.

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:49.082
‐ [roars]

00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:54.454
‐ Meido Zangetsuha!

00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:59.626
‐ [roars]

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.466
‐ Wonderfully done,
Lord Sesshomaru.

00:16:06.533 --> 00:16:09.469
‐ Hey! I'm the one
who finished the job.

00:16:09.536 --> 00:16:12.405
‐ You sure did!
Amazing work, Inuyasha.

00:16:12.438 --> 00:16:14.074
‐ Don't get cocky!

00:16:14.107 --> 00:16:16.376
It is all thanks
to my Lord Sesshomaru

00:16:16.409 --> 00:16:18.311
that you can wield
Meido Zangetsuha

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:19.312
in the first place!

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:20.413
‐ Jaken.

00:16:20.446 --> 00:16:21.715
‐ Eh?
‐ We're leaving.

00:16:21.748 --> 00:16:23.416
‐ Y‐Yes, sir!

00:16:25.418 --> 00:16:27.320
INUYASHA: Kagome, let's go!

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.322
‐ Hey, slow down!

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:37.831
‐ Why have you awakened me?

00:16:37.898 --> 00:16:41.502
The Great Dog‐Demon's sons
have surely dealt

00:16:41.568 --> 00:16:44.605
with the Grim Comet's fragment
by now.

00:16:44.638 --> 00:16:48.408
‐ Sesshomaru has taken
a human as his bride,

00:16:48.441 --> 00:16:51.645
just like the Great Dog‐Demon
once did.

00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:52.646
‐ He did what?

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:54.280
‐ At this rate,

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.284
Sesshomaru will experience
the same fate as his father.

00:16:58.284 --> 00:17:00.353
Are you going
to let that happen?

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:04.124
Also he has brought about
two daughters,

00:17:04.157 --> 00:17:06.660
half‐demon twins.

00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:08.461
You remember, yes?

00:17:08.494 --> 00:17:11.765
The Shikon Jewel is gone now,

00:17:11.798 --> 00:17:15.468
but it still left us a prophecy
before its departure.

00:17:17.303 --> 00:17:18.471
My dear little brother...

00:17:18.505 --> 00:17:20.373
your life will be taken

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.644
by something that's
neither human nor demon,

00:17:23.677 --> 00:17:27.514
a being which exists
on the edge of possibility,

00:17:27.548 --> 00:17:30.383
that is able to transcend
the flow of time.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:32.218
Back then, you laughed it off,

00:17:32.285 --> 00:17:34.688
saying that no such thing
could exist,

00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:37.190
but thanks
to the Great Dog‐Demon,

00:17:37.223 --> 00:17:41.161
that which should not exist
has become reality.

00:17:41.194 --> 00:17:43.730
That is the nature
of the half‐demon.

00:17:43.797 --> 00:17:47.968
They are an existence that is
neither demon nor human.

00:17:48.001 --> 00:17:50.671
Also a quarter‐demon
will soon be born

00:17:50.671 --> 00:17:53.206
between Inuyasha and Kagome,

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:56.376
the girl who surpassed time
to appear in this world.

00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:59.312
If we cannot erase
these half‐demons,

00:17:59.345 --> 00:18:03.517
along with their variants,
the outcome for you is clear.

00:18:03.517 --> 00:18:06.386
Just as the Shikon Jewel
prophesized,

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:08.321
you will meet your end.

00:18:15.729 --> 00:18:17.764
Lord Sesshomaru.

00:18:17.831 --> 00:18:20.701
‐ It's been quite a while,
Kirinmaru.

00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:25.205
Do you intend to slay Inuyasha?

00:18:25.238 --> 00:18:27.541
‐ That was my intention, yes.

00:18:27.541 --> 00:18:28.842
‐ Oh, my!

00:18:28.875 --> 00:18:31.545
Could Lord Sesshomaru
be offering assistance?

00:18:32.679 --> 00:18:35.516
‐ Very well, Sesshomaru.

00:18:35.549 --> 00:18:37.350
Come with me.

00:18:37.383 --> 00:18:39.620
[dramatic music playing]

00:18:41.054 --> 00:18:43.624
‐ You're such a good girl,
aren't you, now?

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:44.858
‐ Kagome!

00:18:44.891 --> 00:18:46.793
Hurry. They're already here.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:47.794
‐ Mm‐hmm.

00:18:47.861 --> 00:18:48.729
‐ [grunts]

00:18:53.567 --> 00:18:56.436
‐ This is a keepsake
from Inuyasha's mother.

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:57.638
[drop splashes]

00:18:57.704 --> 00:19:00.406
I decided if we ever had a girl,

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.608
I'd give this to her.

00:19:06.412 --> 00:19:09.215
Hachi, please take care of her.

00:19:16.623 --> 00:19:18.925
We will never
give Moroha to you!

00:19:18.925 --> 00:19:20.961
‐ Quit your squawking, human.

00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:22.328
[gasps]

00:19:23.664 --> 00:19:24.965
‐ [groans]
‐ Inuyasha!

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.569
Inuyasha, are you OK?

00:19:28.602 --> 00:19:29.469
‐ Yeah.

00:19:32.606 --> 00:19:34.675
‐ [yells]
‐ No!

00:19:36.843 --> 00:19:38.444
Kagome!

00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:41.782
‐ Why did you help them?

00:19:41.782 --> 00:19:43.483
‐ I did no such thing.

00:19:43.517 --> 00:19:48.021
‐ Lord Kirinmaru. The truth
is there will come a time

00:19:48.088 --> 00:19:51.491
when Inuyasha's Meido Zangetsuha
will be needed in the future.

00:19:51.525 --> 00:19:55.095
Until then, I think we should
simply have them pay respect

00:19:55.128 --> 00:19:56.997
to the Great Dog‐Demon's grave.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:59.833
‐ [scoffs] I will allow it.

00:20:03.637 --> 00:20:05.005
RIKU: <i>I'm glad the Black Pearl</i>

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:07.473
<i>and Lady Izayoi's rouge</i>
<i>were useful.</i>

00:20:08.642 --> 00:20:10.644
[chuckles]

00:20:10.644 --> 00:20:12.378
[waterfall rushing]

00:20:12.445 --> 00:20:14.515
[birds chirping]

00:20:21.888 --> 00:20:23.790
‐ There they are, sleeping.

00:20:25.025 --> 00:20:27.994
Thanks to my Dream Gazing spell,

00:20:28.028 --> 00:20:29.963
I've finally found them.

00:20:32.833 --> 00:20:36.737
Homura, I want you
to burn that forest down.

00:20:36.803 --> 00:20:38.572
‐ Are you sure?

00:20:38.639 --> 00:20:39.873
‐ Yes. Aren't we...

00:20:39.906 --> 00:20:41.374
Lord Sesshomaru?

00:20:47.714 --> 00:20:51.484
Burn it all until those
cursed half‐demon sisters

00:20:51.518 --> 00:20:53.754
are wiped from this plane
of existence.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.088
‐ Understood.

00:20:55.155 --> 00:20:57.323
[animals squealing]

00:20:59.993 --> 00:21:01.361
‐ This way! Hurry!

00:21:05.165 --> 00:21:08.034
‐ Don't leave me, Sis! [gasps]

00:21:10.537 --> 00:21:11.905
‐ Setsuna?

00:21:11.938 --> 00:21:12.906
Setsuna!

00:21:12.939 --> 00:21:14.407
‐ You came back!

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.441
‐ Are you OK?

00:21:15.509 --> 00:21:17.410
I'm sorry I ran ahead like that.

00:21:20.747 --> 00:21:22.916
‐ [gasps]
Sis, get out of the way!

00:21:28.855 --> 00:21:29.723
‐ Oh, no!

00:21:31.191 --> 00:21:32.759
‐ Setsuna!

00:21:35.061 --> 00:21:37.197
‐ Come on. Where is she?

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:39.900
‐ Setsuna!
‐ RIKU: <i>And thus Lady Towa,</i>

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.802
<i>daughter of Lord Sesshomaru,</i>

00:21:41.868 --> 00:21:44.070
<i>was spirited away</i>
<i>to another time.</i>

00:21:47.774 --> 00:21:49.776
<i>That's all I can say for now.</i>

00:21:53.079 --> 00:21:54.881
[insects chirping]

00:21:54.915 --> 00:21:56.583
Huh?

00:21:56.617 --> 00:21:59.485
Hey now, don't be chomping
at the bit to hear the rest.

00:21:59.553 --> 00:22:00.621
It's in poor taste.

00:22:00.654 --> 00:22:01.588
Whoa there.

00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:03.790
If fate allows it,

00:22:03.824 --> 00:22:06.226
perhaps we shall meet again
one day.

00:22:06.259 --> 00:22:08.094
Until then, farewell.

00:22:12.465 --> 00:22:14.400
[Japanese music playing]

00:23:43.189 --> 00:23:45.191
JYUBEI: What?!
You threw that child

00:23:45.191 --> 00:23:47.327
into the crucible of Kodoku?

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.329
YAWARAGI: Her chances
of surviving are half.

00:23:49.362 --> 00:23:50.531
MOROHA: Yawaragi,

00:23:50.564 --> 00:23:53.033
our master‐pupil
relationship ends today!

00:23:53.066 --> 00:23:55.001
I'll be taking Kurikaramaru.

00:23:55.035 --> 00:23:57.871
TOWA: Hearing how Moroha
was sold off by her master

00:23:57.871 --> 00:23:58.939
really surprised me.

00:23:59.005 --> 00:24:00.240
SETSUNA:
But why is she associating

00:24:00.273 --> 00:24:02.042
with one of the Four Perils?

00:24:02.075 --> 00:24:05.345
TOWA: <i>Next time on</i> Yashahime,
<i>"Double‐Edged Moroha."</i>

00:24:05.378 --> 00:24:07.180
MOROHA: Don't butt in, you two.

00:24:07.213 --> 00:24:09.883
This is between Yawaragi and me.
