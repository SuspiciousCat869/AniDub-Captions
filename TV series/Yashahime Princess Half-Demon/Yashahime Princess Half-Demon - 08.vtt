That's so rude!

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.633
I can't believe
the two of you

00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.773
had the gall to jump
over me like that! Ohh!

00:01:01.806 --> 00:01:04.473
‐ Takechiyo,
give me a lift, will you?!

00:01:04.506 --> 00:01:07.506

They run way too fast!

‐ Oh, my gosh! This is so good!

00:01:17.106 --> 00:01:18.340
What are these called?

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.573
‐ These treats are called
Rock Paper Scissor Gummies.

00:01:20.606 --> 00:01:22.506
And there's more
where that came from.

00:01:23.606 --> 00:01:25.173
‐ OK, it's a deal!

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.473

has good taste.

‐ Look what we have here.
Lord Riku.

00:03:37.186 --> 00:03:39.653
Coming all this way
wasn't necessary.

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:43.753
If it's business,
you can call on Takechiyo.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.520
‐ [grunts]

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.786
I finally met her.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.320
‐ Met who, if I may be so bold?

00:03:51.353 --> 00:03:53.586
‐ Lord Sesshomaru's daughter.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.453
Her name was Lady Towa,
I believe.

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.686
She was a fine young woman,

00:03:58.753 --> 00:04:01.326
and she's got a certain
something that we lack.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.660
‐ Yes, she and the other two

00:04:02.693 --> 00:04:05.326
should be able to defeat
the Four Perils for you.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.126
‐ I never cared
for the Four Perils.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.193
Those guys have poor taste.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.293
‐ Well, sir, I for one cannot
begin to thank you enough

00:04:15.326 --> 00:04:17.526
for your continued patronage.

00:04:19.493 --> 00:04:23.126
‐ Mr. Jyubei, finish off
the other Four Perils.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.360
I've decided to take
their Rainbow Pearls.

00:04:25.426 --> 00:04:27.826
You will do this for me,
won't you?

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.326
[tone chimes]

00:04:31.693 --> 00:04:33.493
‐ It will be as you say.

00:04:33.526 --> 00:04:36.459
However, with your powers,
I'm certain

00:04:36.493 --> 00:04:39.193
you could make short work
of the Four Perils yourself.

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:42.193
There's no need
to put a bounty on them.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.826
‐ Come on, now.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.326
Weren't you listening?

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.793
I absolutely loathe
the Four Perils.

00:04:50.826 --> 00:04:53.126
The only time I'd be
willing to take a life

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.326
is if I'm taking it
from someone that I love.

00:04:58.526 --> 00:05:01.800
And so I'll handle
the Half‐Demon Princesses

00:05:01.833 --> 00:05:04.533
and their three
Rainbow Pearls myself.

00:05:04.533 --> 00:05:06.100
[chuckles]

00:05:06.133 --> 00:05:07.666
Though I do wonder,

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.266
can I wait 'til
all seven pearls are gathered?

00:05:11.366 --> 00:05:13.266
[wings flapping]

00:05:18.266 --> 00:05:19.700
‐ My plan is ruined.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.533
I might be powerful, but there's
no way I can take on all three

00:05:22.533 --> 00:05:25.433
of those vicious
Half‐Demon Princesses at once.

00:05:25.466 --> 00:05:27.266

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.533

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.433

‐ Yotsume, you fool!

00:05:35.366 --> 00:05:36.366
Lady Kyuki?

00:05:36.433 --> 00:05:38.600
‐ Were you too busy
cowering to notice?

00:05:38.633 --> 00:05:40.366
The Half‐Demon Princesses
followed you

00:05:40.433 --> 00:05:41.633
and are not far behind!

00:05:41.666 --> 00:05:42.766
‐ [moans]

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.533

[energy crackles]

00:05:48.533 --> 00:05:51.433
‐ [gasps]
That, it's a Rainbow Pearl.

00:05:51.466 --> 00:05:54.100
‐ Yotsume,
I want you to use this

00:05:54.133 --> 00:05:56.433
and suss out
all their weaknesses.

00:05:56.466 --> 00:05:59.833
To that end, use the full extent
of your power.

00:05:59.866 --> 00:06:01.373
‐ But what do you mean?

00:06:01.373 --> 00:06:03.373
‐ The Dream Gazing spell.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.206
‐ Right!
Yes, how could I forget?

00:06:05.273 --> 00:06:08.140
‐ Also, the Half‐Demon
Princess Towa,

00:06:08.173 --> 00:06:10.540
be certain to peer
into her Reiwa world.

00:06:11.673 --> 00:06:13.673
‐ Lady Kyuki,
thank you for allowing me

00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:16.206
to use the Rainbow Pearl's
demon power!

00:06:16.273 --> 00:06:18.540

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.840
MOROHA: So this is
Kyuki's fortress, huh?

00:06:31.873 --> 00:06:35.140
Thanks for leading us
all the way here, Yotsume.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.540
What's this?

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.706
Looks like you got yourself
a little makeover.

00:06:39.773 --> 00:06:41.440
‐ Shut up!

00:06:41.473 --> 00:06:44.206

00:06:52.173 --> 00:06:54.040
I'm gonna send you
to the afterlife

00:06:54.106 --> 00:06:55.706

Crimson Dragon Wa‐‐Eh?

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.773
‐ You idiot!

00:06:59.806 --> 00:07:01.680
‐ What?
‐ Moroha!

00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:04.380

<i>I can't move.</i>

00:07:12.213 --> 00:07:13.780
‐ Moroha!

00:07:13.813 --> 00:07:14.780
Are you alright?

00:07:14.813 --> 00:07:16.446
‐ Don't drop your guard.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.446
He's pretty dangerous.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.546
‐ [laughs]

00:07:20.613 --> 00:07:22.780
You'll be joining her next!

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.046
‐ Takechiyo,
can't you fly faster?

00:07:29.113 --> 00:07:31.046
‐ I'm already flying
pretty fast, you know.

00:07:31.113 --> 00:07:32.513
‐ Well, not fast enough!

00:07:32.546 --> 00:07:33.680
Open up!

00:07:33.713 --> 00:07:35.646
‐ [grunts]

00:07:37.346 --> 00:07:38.813
[gasps] Yummy!

00:07:38.846 --> 00:07:41.546
‐ It's a pineapple
Rock Paper Scissor candy.

00:07:41.613 --> 00:07:43.313
Hold it in your mouth
long enough,

00:07:43.346 --> 00:07:44.646
and it'll change its flavor.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.213
‐ Alright!
You've got me all fired up now!

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.546
‐ Good. Let's get going.

00:07:48.546 --> 00:07:51.313
I have chocolates, too,
if you need a boost.

00:08:01.553 --> 00:08:03.053

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.353
You can't
stay hidden there forever.

00:08:05.386 --> 00:08:07.286
Why don't you come on out?

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.353
There you are!

00:08:08.386 --> 00:08:09.720

Does this one
not have any dreams?

00:08:22.553 --> 00:08:23.720

00:08:23.786 --> 00:08:26.553

Take this! Hah!

[both gasp]

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.553

‐ Why can't I move my body?

00:08:37.653 --> 00:08:39.553
‐ Towa, wake up.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.453
Towa!

<i>What did the Elder,</i>

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.126
<i>I see. But if you're set</i>

<i>I won't be able to treat him</i>

MOROHA: <i>Huh? Is this a dream?</i>

00:09:45.226 --> 00:09:47.726
<i>Why would I have</i>

This is how her dreams
are taken away.

00:11:08.406 --> 00:11:10.073
‐ Are you ready to die?

00:11:10.106 --> 00:11:11.440

Why don't you have any dreams?!

Scourge of Swallows!

00:11:19.473 --> 00:11:21.340
‐ [screaming]

00:11:25.306 --> 00:11:26.173
[scream fades]

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.306
SETSUNA: A Rainbow Pearl?

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.440
I see now.

00:11:31.673 --> 00:11:33.273
He must have been using that.

00:11:33.306 --> 00:11:34.806
MOROHA: Setsuna!

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.073
‐ You're awake?

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.773
‐ Yotsume...

00:11:38.806 --> 00:11:41.240
you were
an utter disappointment.

00:11:41.273 --> 00:11:44.073
Oh, well. At least
the spell's still in effect.

00:11:44.106 --> 00:11:47.340
Now, what kind of dream
will you have?

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.240
TOWA: <i>That's the Sacred Tree.</i>

00:11:56.306 --> 00:11:57.406
[water drips]

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.280
<i>‐ So you've returned,</i>
<i>Dream Butterfly.</i>

00:12:00.313 --> 00:12:02.513
TOWA: <i>That voice...</i>

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.180
<i>Oh! The Tree of Ages</i>
<i>is speaking.</i>

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.580
<i>Who is this woman?</i>

00:12:15.846 --> 00:12:17.280
TREE: <i>The poor soul.</i>

00:12:17.313 --> 00:12:20.246
<i>Being unable to sleep</i>
<i>is harrowing,</i>

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.280
<i>but so, too, is a slumber</i>
<i>that never ceases.</i>

00:12:24.313 --> 00:12:28.246
<i>Don't you agree,</i>
<i>daughter of Sesshomaru?</i>

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.180
[Towa gasps]

00:12:30.313 --> 00:12:32.646
[gasps]

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.480
‐ Well, finally.

00:12:34.513 --> 00:12:35.680
‐ Ah, you're awake.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.680
‐ We were all
under a dream spell.

00:12:37.746 --> 00:12:40.346
‐ Wait. A dream?

00:12:40.346 --> 00:12:42.246
But I...

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.280
Where's Yotsume?!

00:12:43.313 --> 00:12:45.513
‐ Prepare yourself
to be astounded!

00:12:45.513 --> 00:12:47.180
Setsuna killed Yotsume

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.180
while the rest of us
were in dreamland.

00:12:49.246 --> 00:12:50.180
‐ Huh?

00:12:50.246 --> 00:12:51.513
MOROHA: She burnt him to ashes,

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.413
which means no bounty
for me to collect.

00:12:53.446 --> 00:12:55.013
‐ What's the deal, Setsuna?

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.513
We were supposed to try
and get information out of him.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.286
‐ I know, right? So rude!

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.453
‐ Our situation didn't allow
for such a luxury.

00:13:03.486 --> 00:13:06.420
‐ Hey, you shouldn't be
fighting at a time like this!

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:08.286
You still have a job to do!

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.420
It's time to charge in to one
of the Four Perils' fortresses!

00:13:11.453 --> 00:13:12.453
SETSUNA: Right.

00:13:12.486 --> 00:13:13.620
TOWA: Yeah, I know.

00:13:13.653 --> 00:13:15.486
MOROHA: And this time,
I'll be sure to collect

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.520
that huge bounty of hers.

00:13:25.453 --> 00:13:27.253
‐ [laughs]

00:13:27.286 --> 00:13:28.920
The dreams were quite blended,

00:13:28.953 --> 00:13:31.753
but all in all, I think
I follow what's going on.

00:13:31.786 --> 00:13:34.620
The Tree of Ages' involvement
in this incident

00:13:34.653 --> 00:13:36.520
was rather unexpected, though.

00:13:38.653 --> 00:13:40.453
[laughs]

00:13:40.453 --> 00:13:42.253
‐ MOROHA: Hey, Kyuki!
‐ Eh?

00:13:42.286 --> 00:13:44.820
‐ Spying on people's dreams
while they sleep?

00:13:44.853 --> 00:13:47.420
Do you realize
how disgusting that is?

00:13:47.453 --> 00:13:49.286
‐ Half‐Demon Princesses,

00:13:49.286 --> 00:13:51.253
‐ you made it.
‐ [all gasp]

00:13:51.286 --> 00:13:54.620
‐ You three wretches are
Lord Kirinmaru's enemies,

00:13:54.653 --> 00:13:56.820
so I, Kyuki of the Four Perils,

00:13:56.853 --> 00:14:00.160
will now take it upon myself
to punish you in his name!

00:14:01.626 --> 00:14:02.693
[grunts]

00:14:03.793 --> 00:14:05.626
[rocks falling]

00:14:06.693 --> 00:14:09.293
‐ Hah! Kyuki of the Four Perils?

00:14:09.326 --> 00:14:11.593
Sorry, but since we
took care of Tokotsu,

00:14:11.626 --> 00:14:13.160
there's only three of you left.

00:14:13.193 --> 00:14:15.626
We even handled your buddies
Fubuki and Yotsume,

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.160
so you're on your own, lady!

00:14:17.193 --> 00:14:19.193
You ain't got
a chance in hell to win.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.193
In fact,
you gotta be pretty crazy

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.793
to even think you can
still take us on at this point.

00:14:23.793 --> 00:14:26.293
So be a nice demon,
and hand over your head!

00:14:26.326 --> 00:14:29.293
‐ Hmph. You're a feisty one,
aren't you?

00:14:29.326 --> 00:14:33.293
But, Half‐Demon Princesses,
could you really be so naive

00:14:33.293 --> 00:14:35.293
as to think
that glancing into your dreams

00:14:35.326 --> 00:14:36.793
was the full extent of my plan?

00:14:36.826 --> 00:14:38.426
‐ [gasps] It's not?

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.260
Do I seem the type to bluff?

00:14:40.293 --> 00:14:43.493
Use that rouge of yours,
become Beniyasha, and find out.

00:14:43.526 --> 00:14:44.793
‐ Oh, now I'm pissed!

00:14:44.793 --> 00:14:46.693
You're gonna eat those words!

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.926
‐ [chuckles]

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.193
‐ No, Moroha! Wait.
‐ Look at her face.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:53.926
She's up to something.
Don't do it!

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.126
‐ Listen up. With this rouge,

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.293
I become Beniyasha,
the Destroyer of Lands.

00:14:59.293 --> 00:15:01.600
Tremble before
the bloodthirsty dawn!

00:15:01.633 --> 00:15:03.533
Bear witness to your end,
if you so dare!

00:15:06.966 --> 00:15:07.933
‐ Huh?
‐ [both gasp]

00:15:07.966 --> 00:15:08.933
‐ Wait. What?

00:15:08.966 --> 00:15:10.466
‐ I made a few improvements

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.833
to Yotsume's
Dream Gazing spell.

00:15:12.866 --> 00:15:14.433
The best part is I've made it

00:15:14.466 --> 00:15:17.466
so this Rainbow Pearl can
absorb all your demon energy.

00:15:18.633 --> 00:15:19.800
‐ [gasps]

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.700
[music playing]

00:15:25.666 --> 00:15:28.166
‐ Oh, no. Even my Kikujumonji.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.866
‐ I see.
Now, out of the three of us,

00:15:30.933 --> 00:15:33.300
I'm the only one
who can face you.

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.700
‐ [chuckles] And how well

00:15:34.766 --> 00:15:37.466
do you think that will go
all on your own?

00:15:37.466 --> 00:15:38.366
[grunts]

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.166
[both yelp]

00:15:42.666 --> 00:15:43.666
‐ [grunting]

00:15:53.933 --> 00:15:55.500
Impressive.

00:15:55.533 --> 00:15:58.766
You did say you weren't
so weak to rely on dreams.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.540
Seems that wasn't a lie.

00:16:16.706 --> 00:16:19.340
KYUKI: Brace yourself,
Princess Half‐Demon.

00:16:19.373 --> 00:16:21.606
‐ So that's your true form, huh?

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.273
Scourge of Swallows!

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.140
What?

00:16:27.173 --> 00:16:29.606
‐ My Rainbow Pearl
has the power to absorb

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.540
any demon energy in the area,
including yours.

00:16:33.606 --> 00:16:35.540
‐ We're in deep trouble, Towa.

00:16:35.606 --> 00:16:37.540
‐ We have to come up
with a plan fast.

00:16:37.606 --> 00:16:38.840
Otherwise, Setsuna's gonna be‐‐

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:40.273
‐ That's right!

00:16:40.306 --> 00:16:42.473
Remember when you went up
against that ghost cat?

00:16:42.473 --> 00:16:44.673
You were able to absorb
just its demon energy

00:16:44.706 --> 00:16:46.440
without killing the monk.

00:16:47.506 --> 00:16:48.840
According to Grandpa Myoga,

00:16:48.873 --> 00:16:52.306
you have the ability to steal
energy from other demons.

00:16:52.306 --> 00:16:54.806
‐ But I was desperately trying
to save Juan at the time,

00:16:54.806 --> 00:16:56.640
so I have no idea how I did it.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.640
‐ Well, desperate times call
for desperate measures, Towa.

00:16:58.673 --> 00:17:00.646
Iron‐Reaver, Soul‐Stealer!

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.546
‐ [gasps]

00:17:02.613 --> 00:17:04.280
Hey, what did you do that for?!

00:17:04.313 --> 00:17:05.780
‐ I hit you with demon energy.

00:17:05.813 --> 00:17:07.780
Transfer it to the Kikujumonji.

00:17:07.813 --> 00:17:09.613
‐ [gasps] Transfer it?

00:17:09.646 --> 00:17:11.513
[Setsuna and Kyuki
yelling, grunting]

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.280
‐ [gasps] It grew a little.

00:17:16.313 --> 00:17:18.646
‐ That means the more
demon energy attacks you take,

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.713
the more you can
hit 'em back ten times over

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.146
with your own energy thrown in.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:23.446
‐ Ah.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.146
‐ But remember, this only works

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.313
if you can withstand
your enemy's attacks.

00:17:27.346 --> 00:17:28.813
'Cause if you can't...

00:17:28.813 --> 00:17:29.880
‐ What happens?

00:17:29.946 --> 00:17:31.880
‐ You'll end up dead.

00:17:31.946 --> 00:17:33.646
‐ Well, that's obvious.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.780
‐ Towa, you're the only one
of us who can do this.

00:17:36.813 --> 00:17:39.180
You got one chance.
Now listen up.

00:17:39.213 --> 00:17:41.780
‐ [Setsuna grunting]
‐ [naginata clanging]

00:17:41.813 --> 00:17:43.813
‐ Alright. I'll give it a shot.

00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:46.146
[grunts]

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.346
Over here, Kyuki.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.280
[yells]

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.546
‐ [groans]
‐ Towa!

00:17:53.613 --> 00:17:55.113
Don't push yourself!

00:17:56.313 --> 00:17:57.313
‐ [groans]

00:17:58.513 --> 00:18:00.153
It's her demon energy.

00:18:01.686 --> 00:18:04.153
[energy chimes]

00:18:05.286 --> 00:18:06.486
Alright.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.853
SETSUNA: Her demon blade grew.

00:18:08.886 --> 00:18:13.386
I get it. She's absorbing
the energy she gets hit with.

00:18:13.453 --> 00:18:15.386
Not bad, Towa.

00:18:15.453 --> 00:18:16.886
I better get to work, too.

00:18:16.953 --> 00:18:18.786
Cyclone Burst!

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.453
[gasps] Not again.

00:18:24.486 --> 00:18:27.620
KYUKI: How many times
do I have to tell you?

00:18:27.653 --> 00:18:29.486
All the demon energy
you throw at me

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.486
is being absorbed by this Pearl.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.653
‐ Towa, you've got one shot.
Don't mess up.

00:18:34.653 --> 00:18:36.620
‐ [laughs]

00:18:36.653 --> 00:18:37.520
‐ Now!

00:18:38.653 --> 00:18:39.820
‐ What?

00:18:41.686 --> 00:18:43.186
‐ Alright!

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:44.320
‐ Towa!

00:18:44.353 --> 00:18:46.286
‐ [yelling]

00:18:52.286 --> 00:18:54.820
RIKU: Looks like
I made it in time.

00:18:54.853 --> 00:18:56.653
‐ If you don't mind my saying,

00:18:56.653 --> 00:18:59.860
it's kind of unusual that you're
coming to observe, Lord Riku.

00:18:59.893 --> 00:19:01.360
‐ [chuckles]

00:19:01.393 --> 00:19:03.626
I was struck
with the urge, is all.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:07.360
<i>The Azure Dragon Wave</i>
<i>you got from Lord Sesshomaru,</i>

00:19:07.393 --> 00:19:10.826
<i>go on and show it to me,</i>
<i>won't you, Lady Towa?</i>

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.393
‐ [yells]

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.460
[breathes deeply]

00:19:16.493 --> 00:19:17.826
‐ Amazing.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.526
‐ Here I go!

00:19:21.693 --> 00:19:24.526
[groans]

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.660
‐ Oh, no.
She has enough demon energy,

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.660
but her sword still lacks
the will to destroy the enemy.

00:19:30.693 --> 00:19:34.826
KYUKI: All that demon energy,
and that's the best you can do?

00:19:34.826 --> 00:19:36.226
[laughs]

00:19:36.293 --> 00:19:38.326
‐ Are you still hesitating?

00:19:38.326 --> 00:19:39.660
‐ TOWA: Why?
‐ [gasps]

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.526
‐ Why can't I beat her?

00:19:43.493 --> 00:19:44.660
Why?

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.526
Damn it! Why?!

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.326
‐ Towa, watch out!
‐ [grunts]

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:52.560
‐ [groans]
‐ Setsuna.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:54.826
Hey, Setsuna!

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.526
Come on! Say something!

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.166
‐ [gasps]
‐ Setsuna!

00:19:59.233 --> 00:20:00.466
‐ Oh, no.

00:20:01.766 --> 00:20:03.600
It happened again.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.100
‐ [gasps] <i>Sis, look out!</i>

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.400
