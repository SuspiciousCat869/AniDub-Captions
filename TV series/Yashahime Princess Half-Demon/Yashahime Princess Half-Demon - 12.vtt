‐ Lord Konton.
‐ Hmm.

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:52.118
‐ It is I, Nikosen.

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:55.188
‐ I've heard that you
mastered a human craft

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:58.625
before you became an apparition.
Is that true?

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:00.561
‐ It is.

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:03.229
‐ Then you will perform
a dance for me.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.665
‐ A dance?

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:06.567
‐ There's a group of half‐demons

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:09.169
who are in possession
of the Rainbow Pearls.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.204
‐ Half‐demons?

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:14.741
It is my understanding
that they were offspring

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:18.244
born from pairings
between humans and demons.

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:20.581
‐ How utterly distasteful.

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:24.585
‐ So some mere half‐demons
have the Rainbow Pearls?

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:26.252
‐ Indeed.

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:27.888
Distasteful!

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:31.725
‐ I see.
So you think that I, Nikosen,

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:33.326
being both demon and human,

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:36.530
am best suited to the task
of disposing of them.

00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:40.266
As you say, I shall dance
brilliantly for you.

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:43.336
‐ I hope you put on
an excellent show.

SETSUNA:
There's another request?

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:40.854
‐ That's right.
Apparently a demon named Nikosen

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:42.388
dried up an entire mountain,

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:44.891
so the nearby villagers
are pretty frightened.

00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:47.027
Think you can take care of it,
Setsuna?

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.962
‐ There's no way
we can ignore the villagers

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:50.964
if they need our help.
Right, Setsuna?

00:03:51.031 --> 00:03:52.398
‐ [groans]

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:55.401
‐ I'll send Hisui to team up
with you later as well.

00:03:55.502 --> 00:03:58.572
‐ If that's your order, Chief,
then I have no objections.

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.306
‐ [chuckles] Eh?

00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:02.709

<i>Now I just have to wait for</i>

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:26.667
SETSUNA: It's that mountain.

00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:29.335
TOWA: All the plants

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:31.772
have dried up
in a really strange way.

00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:34.775
And the soil's a weird color.

00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:36.042
‐ Down there. Look.

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:37.443
I see someone.

00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:38.945
‐ Huh? Down where?

00:04:41.582 --> 00:04:43.784
‐ <i>I see. This is poison,</i>

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.452
<i>but not poison</i>
<i>from an apparition.</i>

00:04:46.553 --> 00:04:49.623
<i>Looks like the nutrients</i>
<i>have been drained from it.</i>

00:04:49.723 --> 00:04:52.526
‐ As you can no doubt see,
all of the trees are barren.

00:04:52.593 --> 00:04:54.628
‐ Yeah. This is pretty horrible.

00:04:54.728 --> 00:04:57.564
Do you have any idea
who could have done this?

00:04:57.631 --> 00:05:00.466
‐ I think it must have been
destroyed by a demon's poison.

00:05:00.567 --> 00:05:02.769
‐ It's definitely
the work of Nikosen.

00:05:02.803 --> 00:05:04.470
‐ Eh?

00:05:04.538 --> 00:05:07.574

TOWA: Moroha!

‐ Why are you two here?

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:18.151
‐ So are you here
to stop Nikosen, too?

00:05:18.218 --> 00:05:19.586
‐ [gasps] How'd you know that?

00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:21.454
‐ We have orders to slay it.

00:05:22.623 --> 00:05:23.890
‐ Aw, man. Don't tell me

00:05:23.957 --> 00:05:26.392
we're gonna have to split
the bounty again.

TOWA: The plants
look more withered

the higher we climb.

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:32.766
‐ And from the smell of things,

00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:35.401
the soil at the top
of the mountain is rotten.

00:05:35.468 --> 00:05:36.737
‐ Yeah.

00:05:36.803 --> 00:05:39.673
‐ I heard that Nikosen used
to be a sage a long time ago,

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.675
but wicked thoughts
made him stray from his path

00:05:41.775 --> 00:05:44.811
until he finally
turned into an apparition.

00:05:44.845 --> 00:05:46.012
Keep your guard up.

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:48.849
The smell of rotting soil
is getting stronger now.

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.685
‐ Stating the obvious
is completely unnecessary.

00:05:51.785 --> 00:05:53.787
‐ Wait. Is something off?

00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:55.922
‐ There's demon energy.
You can't feel it?

00:05:55.989 --> 00:05:57.090
‐ [sighs]

00:05:57.157 --> 00:05:59.526

I've been lying in wait for you,

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.012
‐ So there you are, Nikosen!

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:22.816

No way! But why?

00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:29.823
‐ Just stay back, Towa!

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.792
‐ You half‐demons are impudent

00:06:31.858 --> 00:06:35.028
to think you should possess
the Rainbow Pearls!

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:36.530

00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:38.999
‐ This is bad.
That's sage venom.

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:41.134
If you guys inhale this,
it'll cause some real damage!

00:06:41.201 --> 00:06:42.836
‐ Towa, use this!

SETSUNA: Towa.

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:53.847

00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:55.081

00:07:00.053 --> 00:07:02.088
[groans] It won't cut!

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:03.757
‐ You fool!

00:07:03.824 --> 00:07:06.593
Such a dull sword
will not work on me.

00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:17.237
‐ Sorry.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.841
All I'm doing is getting

Setsuna, can I borrow

one of those protective masks
of yours?

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:38.625
I can't use Kurikaramaru right
when I'm one‐handed.

00:07:40.093 --> 00:07:41.061
I don't have more.

Thanks for waiting!

00:07:54.708 --> 00:07:57.143
Now that I don't have
to worry about your sage venom,

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.079
let's find out
if this Kurikaramaru

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:01.648
really is as dull as you say!

00:08:01.715 --> 00:08:04.985

That bounty of yours is mine!

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:17.831
What the...

00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:18.832
‐ [laughs]

00:08:18.932 --> 00:08:20.834
You're not getting my head.

00:08:20.934 --> 00:08:23.336
‐ Heavenly Arrow Barrage!

00:08:27.641 --> 00:08:30.010
Alright! This time, I got you!

00:08:31.144 --> 00:08:32.646

00:08:44.124 --> 00:08:45.258
I've got this one!

00:08:45.325 --> 00:08:47.828

Hang in there.

00:08:56.937 --> 00:08:59.673
Once we cross this bridge
and go down the hill,

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:01.675
we'll reach the nearby village.

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.044
Almost there.

00:09:04.144 --> 00:09:05.278
You can do this.

00:09:09.149 --> 00:09:11.618
‐ [coughs]

00:09:12.686 --> 00:09:13.887
‐ This doesn't make sense.

00:09:13.987 --> 00:09:17.323
We repelled Nikosen, so why
is the sage venom lingering?

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.693
[Nikosen laughs]

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:21.695
That's because...

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:24.698
I'm still
very much alive and well.

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:25.999
‐ [gasps]

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:27.868
No way.

00:09:31.171 --> 00:09:35.742
‐ Now it's time you gave me
that Gold Pearl of yours.

00:09:36.843 --> 00:09:38.078
‐ Cyclone Burst!

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:44.918
‐ Curse you!

00:09:47.053 --> 00:09:49.055
‐ Scourge of Swallows!

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:53.326
‐ [laughter fades]

00:09:53.393 --> 00:09:55.061
‐ What? An illusion?

00:09:55.095 --> 00:09:57.097
But that must mean
Nikosen's core

00:09:57.163 --> 00:09:58.932
has been his torso
the entire time.

00:09:58.999 --> 00:10:01.702
Sorry, Kirara,
but we have to hurry.

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:03.403
[bridge rattling]

00:10:11.512 --> 00:10:12.946
‐ Would you look at that?

00:10:13.046 --> 00:10:14.848
So you grew yourself
a new head, huh?

00:10:14.915 --> 00:10:17.851
‐ [laughs] Surprised?

00:10:17.918 --> 00:10:19.352
‐ Actually, your head's

00:10:19.419 --> 00:10:22.022
kind of like an endless bounty
if you really think about it.

00:10:22.088 --> 00:10:24.390
And by that logic,
if I can manage to catch you,

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:25.926
I can keep
collecting that bounty

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:28.128
over and over again
as much as I want!

00:10:28.194 --> 00:10:29.930
Meaning I would
be able to pay back

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:32.132
the huge debt that I owe
in no time at all!

00:10:32.198 --> 00:10:34.300
‐ What are you talking about?

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.436
‐ Nikosen,
I'll cut you a good deal,

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:38.371
so let's work together, OK?

00:10:38.438 --> 00:10:40.807
‐ Stop spouting nonsense.

00:10:40.874 --> 00:10:43.443
‐ Stop complaining!
Your head‐regenerating body

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:45.045
is the real nonsense,
you weirdo!

00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:47.047
‐ Shut up, you fool!

00:10:47.113 --> 00:10:49.049
‐ [gasping]

00:10:49.115 --> 00:10:50.250
Huh? [gasps]

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:53.153
Towa, what happened
to your hair?

00:10:53.219 --> 00:10:55.455
Bastard! What the hell
did you do to her?!

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:57.157
‐ How should I know?

00:10:57.257 --> 00:10:58.992
[growls]

00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:00.326
[gasps]

00:11:00.393 --> 00:11:02.062
[screaming]

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:07.968
Well, now...

00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:11.304
isn't that fascinating?

00:11:15.576 --> 00:11:17.443
‐ Please, Kirara,
we have to hurry.

00:11:17.477 --> 00:11:18.478
[gasps]

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.948
Hiraikotsu?

00:11:23.083 --> 00:11:23.984
‐ Setsuna!

00:11:24.084 --> 00:11:26.587
‐ Hisui and the Chief.

00:11:30.657 --> 00:11:32.425
[Moroha grunting]

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:35.596
‐ [panting]

00:11:40.634 --> 00:11:42.503
‐ What is going on
with you, Towa?

00:11:42.603 --> 00:11:46.206
The length and color of her hair
have both changed,

00:11:46.306 --> 00:11:48.341
and I sense no demon energy.

00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:51.444
It's almost as if she's
only a human or something.

00:11:51.477 --> 00:11:52.979
Hmm.

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:54.347
Wait! I know!

00:11:54.447 --> 00:11:56.449
In situations like these...

00:11:56.482 --> 00:11:58.351
Here it is.

00:11:58.451 --> 00:12:01.154
Hey, Grandpa Myoga,
are you out there?!

00:12:01.187 --> 00:12:04.324
I was just thinking
that I should put on my rouge.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.860
‐ ♪ Drifting and drifting
and drifting and‐‐ ♪

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.161
‐ Oh, hey! There you are.

00:12:08.194 --> 00:12:09.329
‐ Did I hear you say

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:11.497
that you'll be using
your rouge, Lady Moroha?

00:12:11.532 --> 00:12:13.033
‐ Whoo‐hoo!
‐ [groans]

00:12:13.133 --> 00:12:14.034
‐ [slurps]

00:12:14.134 --> 00:12:15.502
[groans]

00:12:15.536 --> 00:12:17.671
Oh, looks like
you haven't done it yet.

00:12:18.972 --> 00:12:20.507
‐ Before that,
there's a question

00:12:20.541 --> 00:12:23.176
that I need you
to answer for me if you can.

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:24.511
‐ [Towa moans]
‐ Eh?

00:12:24.545 --> 00:12:27.013
Looks like you're finally awake.

00:12:27.047 --> 00:12:29.182
‐ Where am I? What happened?

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:31.552
‐ [yelps] Oh. Oh, my goodness!

00:12:31.652 --> 00:12:34.688
Lady Towa, that black hair...

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:38.592
I see.

00:12:38.692 --> 00:12:40.226
There's no mistaking it.

00:12:40.326 --> 00:12:42.195
You're experiencing
the New Moon.

00:12:42.228 --> 00:12:43.329
‐ The New Moon?

00:12:43.363 --> 00:12:44.531
‐ That's correct.

00:12:44.565 --> 00:12:46.366
It's a phase
when the demon power

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:49.903
that flows through your blood
is temporarily lost.

00:12:50.003 --> 00:12:53.006
Its timing is different,
depending on the half‐demon.

00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:55.208
There are half‐demons,
like Naraku,

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:57.377
who have the power
to decide on their own,

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:59.079
and then there are
those like you,

00:12:59.179 --> 00:13:00.413
who become entirely human

00:13:00.514 --> 00:13:03.449
during those dark nights
when no moon hangs in the sky.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:04.685
‐ I don't understand.

00:13:04.718 --> 00:13:06.419
This never happened
in the other world.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.554
It's the first time

00:13:07.588 --> 00:13:09.222
I've ever experienced
something like this.

00:13:09.255 --> 00:13:10.624
‐ Hmm.

00:13:10.724 --> 00:13:13.560
If I were to guess,
it may have something to do

00:13:13.627 --> 00:13:16.096
with the fact that you were
originally from this world.

00:13:16.196 --> 00:13:17.397
‐ I grew up in this world,

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:19.299
and I never
had to go through this.

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:21.535
‐ Let's see. I can't say much,

00:13:21.568 --> 00:13:23.403
since there are few precedents,

00:13:23.436 --> 00:13:25.238
but perhaps, as a quarter‐demon,

00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:28.709
Lady Moroha does not experience
the effects of the New Moon.

00:13:28.742 --> 00:13:30.210
‐ And Setsuna?

00:13:30.243 --> 00:13:32.579
She and I have the same blood
running through our veins.

00:13:32.646 --> 00:13:35.749
Does that mean she would lose
her powers the same way I did?

00:13:35.782 --> 00:13:39.052
‐ Since Lady Setsuna
is also a half‐demon,

00:13:39.085 --> 00:13:41.287
I'm afraid she, too,
would not be able to escape

00:13:41.387 --> 00:13:42.756
from the laws of the New Moon.

00:13:42.789 --> 00:13:44.424
‐ This isn't good, Moroha.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:46.126
Where is Setsuna right now?

00:13:46.226 --> 00:13:48.629
‐ Last I saw her, she was
chasing after Nikosen's head.

00:13:48.729 --> 00:13:50.964
‐ Then she might be in danger.

00:13:51.064 --> 00:13:53.333
There's no way
she can slay demons like this.

00:13:53.433 --> 00:13:55.969
‐ Yes, indeed.
That's a safe assumption.

00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:57.337
On the night of the New Moon,

00:13:57.437 --> 00:13:59.005
half‐demons tend to lie low

00:13:59.105 --> 00:14:01.975
to avoid encountering others
in their weakened state.

00:14:02.075 --> 00:14:03.143
‐ I need to help her!

00:14:03.243 --> 00:14:04.578
‐ Sorry!

00:14:04.611 --> 00:14:05.579
‐ [groans]

00:14:07.113 --> 00:14:08.782
‐ Just stay here, and rest.

00:14:08.815 --> 00:14:11.417
Grandpa Myoga, when it comes
to running away and hiding,

00:14:11.451 --> 00:14:13.153
I know that you're
second to none.

00:14:13.253 --> 00:14:14.788
You already have a plan,
don't you?

00:14:14.821 --> 00:14:17.123
‐ Come again?
‐ You know,

00:14:17.157 --> 00:14:20.460
a way for Towa to stay safe
during the New Moon.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.201
OK.

00:14:28.301 --> 00:14:31.204
Hey! Can I get another one,
Grandpa Myoga?

00:14:31.304 --> 00:14:32.506
‐ Hmm?

00:14:32.606 --> 00:14:33.507
Boing!

00:14:33.607 --> 00:14:36.476
R‐Rolling, rolling,
words on paper.

00:14:36.543 --> 00:14:39.145
[groans]
Here it is, Lady Moroha.

00:14:39.179 --> 00:14:42.148
Please imbue them
with spirit power.

00:14:42.182 --> 00:14:43.650
‐ Alright.

00:14:43.684 --> 00:14:45.185
I think I can handle that.

00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:55.061
Now the barrier is good to go.

00:15:00.166 --> 00:15:01.334
SETSUNA: What's going on?

00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:03.369
‐ What is it, Setsuna?

00:15:03.469 --> 00:15:04.671
‐ Something's not right.

00:15:04.705 --> 00:15:07.674
I can't sense
Towa or Moroha's demon energy,

00:15:07.708 --> 00:15:09.676
and I can't pick up
on their scents.

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:11.645
‐ But that's impossible,
isn't it?

00:15:11.678 --> 00:15:15.215
‐ I don't know, but I need
to hurry up and find them.

00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:19.653
MOROHA: Hey, Grandpa Myoga,

00:15:19.686 --> 00:15:21.655
will this barrier be enough?

00:15:21.688 --> 00:15:24.324
We're up against Nikosen,
after all.

00:15:24.357 --> 00:15:26.660
‐ He may have
technically been a sage before,

00:15:26.693 --> 00:15:30.196
but those who stray toward evil
shouldn't retain the ability

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:32.833
to sense through the wall
of spirit energy you've built.

00:15:36.402 --> 00:15:37.838
‐ How peculiar.

00:15:37.871 --> 00:15:40.874
They should have fallen
somewhere near here.

00:15:40.907 --> 00:15:43.176
But since I can't find
their corpses,

00:15:43.209 --> 00:15:45.612
I suspect
something's not right.

00:15:46.847 --> 00:15:48.749
SETSUNA: Chief!

00:15:48.849 --> 00:15:51.852
I can't find Towa
or Moroha anywhere.

00:15:51.885 --> 00:15:53.386
‐ Usually,
I wouldn't worry too much

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:56.222
when we're talking about
those girls, but this time...

00:15:56.256 --> 00:15:58.224
ROKUTA: Chief,
preparations are done.

00:15:58.258 --> 00:16:00.293
NANASUKE: We can shoot anytime.

00:16:00.393 --> 00:16:03.530
‐ It might be best for us
to wait a little while longer.

00:16:03.564 --> 00:16:06.099
‐ No, please,
I think you should start now.

00:16:06.199 --> 00:16:07.734
If anything happens
to those two,

00:16:07.768 --> 00:16:09.603
I'll take care of it
immediately.

00:16:09.703 --> 00:16:12.238
‐ I see. Alright then.

00:16:12.272 --> 00:16:13.774
‐ Let's light it up!
‐ BOTH: Sir!

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:19.913
‐ Hmm? What is that?

00:16:20.947 --> 00:16:21.915
‐ Fire!

00:16:27.921 --> 00:16:30.256
‐ [groans] What?!

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:31.625
‐ KOHAKU: Again!
‐ [snarls]

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.165
Who the hell are they?

00:16:39.265 --> 00:16:42.636
‐ When we reached the area,
sage venom was whirling around,

00:16:42.736 --> 00:16:44.605
so we decided
setting the mountain ablaze

00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:46.507
was the best way
to take care of it.

00:16:46.607 --> 00:16:47.574
‐ Good idea.

00:16:58.284 --> 00:17:00.186
‐ It's getting kind of hot.

00:17:00.286 --> 00:17:01.688
Is it a forest fire?

00:17:01.788 --> 00:17:02.689
‐ [murmurs]

00:17:02.789 --> 00:17:04.190
‐ Towa?

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:06.660
‐ I have a feeling that Setsuna
and the demon slayers

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.762
met up and
are working together now.

00:17:08.795 --> 00:17:10.631
‐ By the way,
sorry I knocked you out.

00:17:10.664 --> 00:17:12.799
‐ I understand, really.

00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:15.602
‐ You know, if you're right
and the demon slayers are here,

00:17:15.636 --> 00:17:17.604
I have to admit
that they sure picked

00:17:17.638 --> 00:17:20.607
an uncharacteristically
flashy way to slay a demon.

00:17:25.679 --> 00:17:28.649
‐ Eh? I sensed them just now.

00:17:28.682 --> 00:17:31.885
‐ Shit. The barrier's fading!

00:17:31.985 --> 00:17:34.521
‐ It's alright, Moroha.
‐ Huh?

00:17:34.621 --> 00:17:37.824
‐ I can't keep running and
hiding around like this forever.

00:17:37.858 --> 00:17:39.526
I'm going
to go look for Setsuna.

00:17:39.626 --> 00:17:41.394
‐ What are you talking about?

00:17:41.494 --> 00:17:43.830
Even if you go out there,
you have no demon power.

00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:45.666
You'll only end up
getting in the way.

00:17:45.699 --> 00:17:48.669
‐ But I think Setsuna's going
through the same thing I am.

00:17:48.702 --> 00:17:49.670
‐ Hmm?

00:17:49.703 --> 00:17:51.838
‐ Going through
a night like this,

00:17:51.905 --> 00:17:54.474
I'm sure that she's feeling
really scared right now.

00:17:54.508 --> 00:17:56.977
‐ I think you might
just be wrong about that.

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:58.545
‐ [gasps]
‐ I mean,

00:17:58.645 --> 00:18:01.314
Setsuna has been managing
all by herself in this era

00:18:01.347 --> 00:18:03.416
just fine so far,
so it's no sweat.

00:18:03.517 --> 00:18:05.018
‐ That isn't true.

00:18:05.051 --> 00:18:06.987
It doesn't matter
what era you live in.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.355
The way that a girl feels
is always the same.

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:11.992
‐ "The way a girl feels"?
Never thought I would hear

00:18:12.025 --> 00:18:13.927
something like that
come out of your mouth.

00:18:14.027 --> 00:18:15.028
‐ Huh? Really?

00:18:15.061 --> 00:18:16.730
‐ [rumbling]
‐ [both gasp]

00:18:18.031 --> 00:18:20.567
‐ So this is
where you've been hiding.

00:18:20.667 --> 00:18:21.768
[both gasp]

00:18:21.868 --> 00:18:23.770
‐ Towa, stay back.

00:18:24.871 --> 00:18:27.040
I've been waiting
for you, Nikosen.

00:18:27.073 --> 00:18:29.576
You're my key to collecting
endless bounties.

00:18:29.676 --> 00:18:32.879
‐ Stop spouting
such ridiculous nonsense!

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:34.280
‐ [groans]

00:18:35.381 --> 00:18:36.783
‐ [yells]
‐ [laughs]

00:18:36.883 --> 00:18:38.552
Is that really all you've got?

00:18:38.619 --> 00:18:39.920
[laughs]

00:18:41.054 --> 00:18:42.556
[both gasp]

00:18:44.625 --> 00:18:46.727
‐ [crackling]
‐ MOROHA: What is this?

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.961
‐ It's solidifying.

00:18:48.061 --> 00:18:49.963
[gasping]

00:18:50.063 --> 00:18:51.732
‐ [gasps] Towa?

00:18:53.399 --> 00:18:55.936
There. That was definitely
Towa's voice just now.

00:18:56.036 --> 00:18:56.937
Towa!

00:19:02.075 --> 00:19:05.411
‐ Now I'll get these two
to Lord Konton.

00:19:05.445 --> 00:19:06.580
Eh?

00:19:08.048 --> 00:19:11.752
‐ Scourge of Swallows!

00:19:14.788 --> 00:19:16.723
‐ [screams]

00:19:16.757 --> 00:19:18.725
‐ [gasps]

00:19:18.759 --> 00:19:20.661
‐ [gasps]

00:19:22.563 --> 00:19:23.930
‐ Are the two of you OK?

00:19:23.964 --> 00:19:25.599
‐ Setsuna!

00:19:25.632 --> 00:19:27.634
‐ Towa? Is that really you?

00:19:27.734 --> 00:19:29.770
‐ Of course it's me.
Can't you tell?

00:19:29.803 --> 00:19:31.938
‐ Well, it's just
that you look so different.

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:34.608
‐ Enough about me, Setsuna.
Are you OK?

00:19:34.641 --> 00:19:35.609
‐ Uh, why?

00:19:35.676 --> 00:19:37.944
‐ Because there's
no moon out tonight.

00:19:37.978 --> 00:19:39.312
It's the New Moon.

00:19:39.412 --> 00:19:40.614
‐ So what?

00:19:40.681 --> 00:19:43.016
‐ Wait. You didn't turn
into a normal girl, too?

00:19:43.116 --> 00:19:44.951
‐ What do you mean, "normal"?

00:19:44.985 --> 00:19:48.421
‐ Hey, uh, do you think
that maybe the Dream Butterfly

00:19:48.454 --> 00:19:50.524
having stolen
Setsu's dreams and memories

00:19:50.624 --> 00:19:53.527
could be why the New Moon
doesn't have any effect on her?

00:19:53.627 --> 00:19:55.962
‐ I see. The New Moon.

00:19:55.996 --> 00:19:59.533
I was thinking Towa's condition
had been strange since evening,

00:19:59.633 --> 00:20:01.635
but that explains everything.

00:20:01.702 --> 00:20:03.537
‐ I'm really sorry, you guys.

00:20:03.637 --> 00:20:06.339
I didn't mean to cause
the two of you so much trouble.

00:20:06.439 --> 00:20:07.340
‐ [energy surges]
‐ Huh?

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.342
[dramatic music playing]

00:20:10.443 --> 00:20:11.377
‐ What's that?

00:20:11.477 --> 00:20:12.979
‐ It can't be!

00:20:13.013 --> 00:20:15.381
MOROHA: That guy
is still alive?!

00:20:15.481 --> 00:20:17.984
‐ [laughs]
‐ [yelps]

00:20:18.018 --> 00:20:20.053
‐ [laughs]

00:20:20.153 --> 00:20:21.722
By swallowing you whole,

00:20:21.822 --> 00:20:24.558
I'll get all the nutrients
of a young half‐demon.

00:20:24.658 --> 00:20:25.659
‐ [gasps]

00:20:27.027 --> 00:20:28.695
‐ [grunts]

00:20:28.795 --> 00:20:30.363
‐ My arm?

00:20:30.463 --> 00:20:32.666
What just happened?

00:20:32.733 --> 00:20:33.667
[both gasp]

00:20:36.803 --> 00:20:38.004
[both wince]

00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:40.006
[heroic music playing]

00:20:42.676 --> 00:20:43.644
‐ That was close.

00:20:43.677 --> 00:20:45.011
You aren't hurt, are you?

00:20:45.078 --> 00:20:47.848
I'm back, as good as new.

00:20:47.881 --> 00:20:49.415
BOTH: Towa!

00:20:49.516 --> 00:20:52.085
‐ Alright. I think
it's time for some payback.

00:20:55.088 --> 00:20:57.023
‐ [growling]

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.495
‐ [yells]

00:21:04.831 --> 00:21:07.534
‐ [groans]

00:21:07.601 --> 00:21:09.169
Impossible.

00:21:09.202 --> 00:21:11.938
How could I be defeated...

00:21:12.038 --> 00:21:15.408
by mere half‐demons?

00:21:24.751 --> 00:21:26.720
[birds warbling]

00:21:29.756 --> 00:21:32.559
‐ Unbelievable.
The head and body both gone,

00:21:32.593 --> 00:21:33.894
poof, just like that!

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.030
Well, there goes my foolproof
plan for an endless bounty.

00:21:37.063 --> 00:21:39.733
‐ [sighs] It never would
have worked anyway, you know.

00:21:39.766 --> 00:21:42.468
‐ There's no way that Mr. Jyubei
wouldn't notice you

00:21:42.569 --> 00:21:43.904
trying to pull
a fast one on him.

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:46.907
‐ Oh, yeah. I suppose
you're right about that.

00:21:46.973 --> 00:21:50.243
Damn it all!

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:57.050
‐ So half‐demons have a phase
called the New Moon.

00:21:57.083 --> 00:22:00.921
Huh. I see.
This is entertaining indeed.

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:06.893
What a wonderful performance.

00:22:11.998 --> 00:22:13.934
[Japanese music playing]

00:23:42.689 --> 00:23:44.090
KOHAKU: A demon has appeared

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:46.693
that attacks virtuous monks
and Shinto priests.

00:23:46.727 --> 00:23:48.762
Hisui, go to Brother's place.

00:23:48.862 --> 00:23:50.864
SETSUNA: So that's Monk Miroku.

00:23:50.897 --> 00:23:52.899
HISUI: He wants
to attain divine power

00:23:52.999 --> 00:23:54.200
through
one thousand‐day training,

00:23:54.234 --> 00:23:56.036
Like it'll go that smoothly.

00:23:56.069 --> 00:23:58.872
TOWA: It's Totetsu,
one of the Four Perils!

00:23:58.905 --> 00:24:01.041
Will he eat anything
with that big mouth?!

00:24:01.074 --> 00:24:02.843
Next time on Yashahime,

00:24:02.876 --> 00:24:04.711
<i>"The Delicious Feudal Monks."</i>

00:24:04.745 --> 00:24:08.048
TOTETSU: Now let's see
how good you taste.

00:24:08.114 --> 00:24:09.916
[laughs] Thanks for the meal!

00:24:10.016 --> 00:24:11.117
[laughs]
