00:00:06.073 --> 00:00:07.941
[wind blowing]

00:00:13.547 --> 00:00:14.748
‐ [chuckles]

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:17.217
I guess I should bring you two
up to speed, huh.

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:27.094
It all started three years ago.

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:28.262
I was still a little kid

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:30.397
who didn't know my left
from my right.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.498
[music playing]

00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:33.500
[bird squawking]

00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:38.405
‐ Moroha.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.142
‐ Yes, Master?
Is there something you needed?

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:43.477
‐ Further into this cave here,

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:46.713
the crucible of Kodoku will soon
begin its honored tradition.

00:00:46.747 --> 00:00:48.982
‐ Crucible of what now?

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:52.553
‐ It's a spell of Fuko
used in Onmyodo.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.423
Within this cave,
there are hundreds of demons

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:57.624
fighting amongst each other...

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:01.228
and the last one left standing

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:04.498
will become known as Kodoku,
the strongest demon.

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.268
‐ [swallows]

00:01:08.302 --> 00:01:09.403
Wait.

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:12.206
You're not asking me
to go in there, are you?

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:13.574
‐ Yes, I am.
‐ [gasps]

00:01:13.607 --> 00:01:16.977
‐ I want you to throw yourself
into that battle and survive.

00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:18.745
If you emerge victorious,

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:21.381
as a symbol of completing
your final training,

00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:24.618
I will reward you
with my prized Kurikaramaru.

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:26.553
‐ You would really
give that to me?

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:30.257
‐ It's been three whole years
since you were entrusted to me

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.726
by the chief
of the Wolf‐Demon Tribe.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.628
This will be your final lesson,

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:37.764
after which your training
will be complete.

00:01:37.798 --> 00:01:38.665
‐ [sighs]

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.635
[Japanese music playing]

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:11.592
[Japanese music playing]

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.038
TOWA: "Double‐Edged Moroha."

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.408
‐ [panting]

00:03:28.442 --> 00:03:29.376
[demon grunts]

00:03:30.477 --> 00:03:32.246
[snarls]

00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:36.650
[growls]

00:03:38.085 --> 00:03:39.753
‐ [groans] Backed into a corner.

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:42.089
There's no choice.
I gotta use this.

00:03:42.122 --> 00:03:44.491
YAWARAGI: <i>You are not allowed</i>
<i>to use that rouge.</i>

00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:46.326
‐ Why the hell not?!

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:48.762
I'm still just a kid,
so I need to become Beniyasha

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:50.163
if I'm gonna be strong enough

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.084
to take out
a Kodoku demon alone.

00:03:52.117 --> 00:03:53.452
What do you want from me?!

00:03:53.485 --> 00:03:55.788
‐ Instead of setting your sights
on the kill,

00:03:55.788 --> 00:03:57.923
you should be focused
on holding on to yourself

00:03:57.957 --> 00:03:59.558
in the midst of battle.

00:03:59.592 --> 00:04:01.460
Don't lose faith!
You just have to use

00:04:01.527 --> 00:04:04.930
the extent of your imagination
to seize victory.

00:04:04.964 --> 00:04:07.433
<i>‐ What the heck</i>
<i>does she mean by that?</i>

00:04:08.601 --> 00:04:10.436
‐ <i>You cannot use your rouge.</i>

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:11.904
<i>Is that clear?</i>

00:04:11.937 --> 00:04:14.974
‐ OK, fine,
if that's how it's gotta be.

00:04:14.974 --> 00:04:18.410
DEMON: It's just you and me,
little girl,

00:04:18.444 --> 00:04:22.314
and there can only be
one left standing!

00:04:22.381 --> 00:04:25.384
‐ Hey, are you sure
we can't talk this over?

00:04:25.417 --> 00:04:27.086
Why don't we
just put our heads together

00:04:27.119 --> 00:04:29.455
and help each other
out of this cave instead?

00:04:29.522 --> 00:04:32.625
‐ You must be joking.
Work together?

00:04:32.691 --> 00:04:34.693
What kind of demon are you?

00:04:34.727 --> 00:04:36.629
Wait. Is that... [inhales]

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:38.697
human blood I smell?

00:04:38.731 --> 00:04:40.633
‐ That's a pretty good nose
you got there.

00:04:40.633 --> 00:04:41.800
I'm a quarter‐demon.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.570
‐ What? How could
a mere quarter‐demon

00:04:44.603 --> 00:04:47.806
still be alive inside
this cesspool of demon energy?

00:04:47.806 --> 00:04:50.075
‐ [scoffs] That's 'cause
I have spirit power

00:04:50.109 --> 00:04:51.911
that's able
to purify demon energy.

00:04:51.944 --> 00:04:53.812
‐ Ridiculous.

00:04:53.812 --> 00:04:56.382
To think that such
an impure presence like you

00:04:56.415 --> 00:04:58.918
was allowed
to muddy up our ritual.

00:04:58.951 --> 00:05:00.553
Hey, gambling bookie,

00:05:00.586 --> 00:05:02.721
I know you're listening!
What's the meaning

00:05:02.755 --> 00:05:05.391
of putting the purity
of our race in danger?!

00:05:05.424 --> 00:05:07.293
‐ [groans] Why don't
you shut the hell up

00:05:07.359 --> 00:05:09.428
about these
stupid little details?!

00:05:09.461 --> 00:05:10.930
Blades of Blood!

00:05:10.963 --> 00:05:12.698
‐ [grunts]

00:05:12.731 --> 00:05:14.633
Hmm? Eh?

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:15.935
‐ Eat this!

00:05:17.803 --> 00:05:19.939
‐ Hmm? [groaning]

00:05:22.875 --> 00:05:25.044
Sorry, pal,
but I think I'm about ready

00:05:25.077 --> 00:05:27.613
to pack up and call it a day.

00:05:27.646 --> 00:05:29.548
‐ [groaning]

00:05:31.984 --> 00:05:35.387
‐ Hey, I gave you a chance
for us to work together.

00:05:40.893 --> 00:05:43.863
It's your own fault
for not taking my offer.

00:05:43.896 --> 00:05:46.298
Enjoy the afterlife.

00:05:46.365 --> 00:05:47.633
I'll just see myself out.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.968
Hup!

00:05:52.037 --> 00:05:53.973
Whew, that was close,

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:56.308
but I managed
to come out on top.

00:05:57.877 --> 00:05:59.812
Master, I've returned!

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:01.080
Where are you?

00:06:01.113 --> 00:06:02.815
[wind blows]

00:06:02.815 --> 00:06:06.485
[crying] Did she leave me?

00:06:09.688 --> 00:06:10.923
JYUBEI: What?

00:06:10.956 --> 00:06:13.792
You threw that child
into the crucible of Kodoku?

00:06:13.859 --> 00:06:17.796
YAWARAGI: I did. Her chances
of surviving are 50‐50.

00:06:17.863 --> 00:06:18.864
[dice rattle]

00:06:19.965 --> 00:06:22.134
JYUBEI:
Without her rouge, though,

00:06:22.201 --> 00:06:27.473
I'd say her chances
are closer to 20%, even 10%.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.810
It's certainly good training
for her if she lives.

00:06:31.944 --> 00:06:33.145
‐ As a quarter‐demon,

00:06:33.145 --> 00:06:35.981
Moroha will need all
the self‐discipline she can get.

00:06:35.981 --> 00:06:38.884
If that child
were a pure‐blooded demon,

00:06:38.918 --> 00:06:39.985
she'd be able to maintain

00:06:40.052 --> 00:06:42.121
her strength of heart
and sense of identity,

00:06:42.154 --> 00:06:44.623
regardless
of whatever came her way.

00:06:44.623 --> 00:06:46.592
But for her, it's different.

00:06:46.625 --> 00:06:48.861
‐ Hmm?
‐ With Moroha,

00:06:48.894 --> 00:06:51.030
when she is forced
to fight for her life,

00:06:51.063 --> 00:06:54.600
her great demon blood fully
takes control, changing her.

00:06:54.633 --> 00:06:57.470
However, just like
the true meaning of her name,

00:06:57.536 --> 00:06:59.472
she's a double‐edged sword.

00:06:59.538 --> 00:07:03.542
Each time it happens, the more
her heart is washed away,

00:07:03.576 --> 00:07:05.978
becoming a monster
that lives only to fight.

00:07:08.247 --> 00:07:09.815
Wha?! [growls]

00:07:09.815 --> 00:07:13.152
‐ So then, in order
to protect her from herself,

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:16.622
you made use of the rouge
and sealed away her demon blood.

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:19.625
‐ Actually the seal
was something that her mother,

00:07:19.692 --> 00:07:21.560
Lady Kagome, had applied,

00:07:21.594 --> 00:07:24.030
but I was able to teach her
how to dispel the seal

00:07:24.063 --> 00:07:27.199
by transforming herself
into Beniyash‐‐Aw, damn it all!

00:07:27.233 --> 00:07:29.468
‐ And because the girl
doesn't know any better,

00:07:29.535 --> 00:07:31.637
she's come to rely
too much on the rouge

00:07:31.704 --> 00:07:33.606
for her own good, yeah?

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:34.974
‐ [groans]

00:07:35.041 --> 00:07:36.709
What a thorn in my side.

00:07:38.811 --> 00:07:41.147
‐ Well, looks like
I won the game.

00:07:41.213 --> 00:07:44.083
If you would kindly
hand me my earnings.

00:07:44.116 --> 00:07:45.117
[coins rattle]

00:07:45.151 --> 00:07:46.919
‐ [grumbles]

00:07:46.952 --> 00:07:49.088
‐ I have to say I'm surprised.

00:07:49.121 --> 00:07:51.190
Why go and sell off
your esteemed pupil

00:07:51.223 --> 00:07:52.892
in a game for just three ryou?

00:07:52.925 --> 00:07:56.095
‐ In order to train her
to maintain her sense of self,

00:07:56.128 --> 00:07:58.464
I had to put her through
the crucible of Kodoku,

00:07:58.531 --> 00:08:00.800
and the only way
I was able to pull that off

00:08:00.866 --> 00:08:02.968
was to set it up through
the demon gambling house.

00:08:03.035 --> 00:08:06.706
‐ And now you only have
two ryou left.

00:08:06.739 --> 00:08:09.041
‐ What other choice do I have?

00:08:09.075 --> 00:08:11.744
I need to get this Armor
of the Iron‐rat off of me

00:08:11.777 --> 00:08:13.913
as soon as possible, after all.

00:08:13.946 --> 00:08:16.716
‐ How much more
will it cost to do that?

00:08:16.749 --> 00:08:18.984
‐ Going off an armor dealer
I spoke to,

00:08:18.984 --> 00:08:21.087
a key can be made to remove it,

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.556
but it has to be made
by a blacksmith rat

00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:25.958
and will cost 12 ryou
for it to be forged.

00:08:26.025 --> 00:08:29.061
‐ I see. Then,
if you would allow me to, I‐‐

00:08:29.095 --> 00:08:30.463
‐ [Moroha growls]
‐ BOTH: Hmm?

00:08:30.529 --> 00:08:32.598
‐ There you are, you old hag!
‐ Hmm?

00:08:32.631 --> 00:08:35.935
YAWARAGI: Oh, Moroha.
You managed to get out, huh?

00:08:35.968 --> 00:08:37.236
‐ Don't give me that!

00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:39.805
Why the hell didn't you
wait for me back there, huh?!

00:08:39.872 --> 00:08:41.707
Did you seriously
go and sell me off

00:08:41.741 --> 00:08:43.609
to the demon gambling house?

00:08:43.642 --> 00:08:45.144
‐ Well, what was I
supposed to do?

00:08:45.144 --> 00:08:47.652
I needed money
to play sugoroku, didn't I?

00:08:47.718 --> 00:08:50.421
‐ I've had it up to here
with your gambling problem,

00:08:50.454 --> 00:08:52.823
and I am over
being your student!

00:08:52.823 --> 00:08:54.158
So now that my training's done,

00:08:54.158 --> 00:08:56.761
I'll be taking Kurikaramaru
with me and heading out.

00:08:56.794 --> 00:08:58.129
‐ Hmm?

00:08:58.196 --> 00:08:59.697
Wait.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.133
Your demon power
hasn't gotten stronger at all.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.402
You didn't absorb
the Kodoku's powers?

00:09:04.435 --> 00:09:07.205
‐ So what? I still won
in the end, didn't I?

00:09:07.238 --> 00:09:09.807
And besides, why would
I wanna absorb something

00:09:09.807 --> 00:09:11.976
from such a gross demon
like that, anyway?

00:09:11.976 --> 00:09:14.212
‐ [laughs]

00:09:14.245 --> 00:09:16.814
To have escaped
from the crucible of Kodoku

00:09:16.881 --> 00:09:18.883
makes you
quite remarkable indeed.

00:09:18.916 --> 00:09:20.251
‐ Who are you, old geezer?

00:09:20.284 --> 00:09:24.121
‐ I'm Corpse Dealer Jyubei,
and I just so happen to work

00:09:24.155 --> 00:09:25.790
in the business
of demons' bounties.

00:09:25.823 --> 00:09:27.325
‐ Well, how very nice for you.

00:09:27.391 --> 00:09:28.793
Anyways, Master‐‐

00:09:28.793 --> 00:09:31.062
Wait a sec. Why am I
still calling you that?

00:09:31.095 --> 00:09:32.630
I'm not your student anymore.

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:34.198
So listen to what I have to say!

00:09:34.232 --> 00:09:35.399
Give me the sword you promised,

00:09:35.433 --> 00:09:37.268
or you and I
are gonna have some words!

00:09:37.301 --> 00:09:39.270
‐ Not so fast there, kiddo.

00:09:39.303 --> 00:09:41.239
I have an idea for you, ma'am.

00:09:41.272 --> 00:09:45.076
What if I were to pay off all
the debt you owe for the child?

00:09:45.109 --> 00:09:46.644
‐ You'd do what?

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:48.446
‐ For pulling out
of the gambling house,

00:09:48.479 --> 00:09:50.314
the Iron‐rat key for the armor,

00:09:50.314 --> 00:09:52.984
and what you lost
in our sugoroku round,

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.087
how does a grand total
of 15 ryou sound to you?

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.121
‐ I'll take it!

00:09:57.154 --> 00:09:58.456
‐ You didn't even hesitate!

00:09:58.489 --> 00:10:00.157
‐ Very well! But first,

00:10:00.224 --> 00:10:02.927
you must hand over
Kurikaramaru to the girl.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.061
‐ [grumbles]

00:10:04.095 --> 00:10:06.597
Okay, if that's part
of the trade, then...

00:10:08.065 --> 00:10:09.100
‐ Uh‐‐

00:10:09.133 --> 00:10:11.636
Wha? [sighs]

00:10:13.871 --> 00:10:14.972
‐ All looks good.

00:10:16.207 --> 00:10:18.442
Well, then,
guess this is farewell, Moroha.

00:10:18.476 --> 00:10:20.044
‐ Uh, wait!

00:10:20.077 --> 00:10:21.145
That's it?!

00:10:21.145 --> 00:10:22.914
‐ Listen up.
‐ Uh...

00:10:22.947 --> 00:10:26.117
As of today, you've been
generously leant 15 ryou

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:28.152
by me, Jyubei,
the corpse dealer,

00:10:28.152 --> 00:10:30.288
and you will work
to pay off that debt

00:10:30.321 --> 00:10:32.156
by hunting down bounties
for me.

00:10:32.156 --> 00:10:34.325
‐ Like hell, I am!
Why do I have to be

00:10:34.392 --> 00:10:36.961
the one responsible
for paying that money to you?

00:10:36.961 --> 00:10:38.229
You trying to piss me off?!

00:10:38.262 --> 00:10:39.797
‐ Then you're content to go back

00:10:39.797 --> 00:10:42.266
and continue fighting
in the crucible of Kodoku

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.735
until you're old and weary?
That right?

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:46.804
‐ [groans]
‐ I didn't think so.

00:10:46.804 --> 00:10:50.308
I'd go with the bounty hunting
if I were you.

00:10:50.308 --> 00:10:52.443
‐ OK, fine.
You win, old geezer.

00:10:52.476 --> 00:10:54.312
‐ "Mr. Jyubei" to you.

00:10:55.746 --> 00:10:58.316
‐ OK, you win, "Mr. Jyubei."

00:11:00.084 --> 00:11:01.953
[wind blowing]

00:11:01.986 --> 00:11:03.988
MOROHA: It's been three years.

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:07.258
Been a while, hasn't it...

00:11:08.359 --> 00:11:09.627
Yawaragi?

00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:16.367
[wind blowing]

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.138
‐ Wow. You're still wearing
the Armor of the Iron‐rat?

00:11:20.205 --> 00:11:22.441
You lose track of
the blacksmiths or somethin'?

00:11:22.474 --> 00:11:25.978
‐ No. It took me a while,
but I was able

00:11:26.044 --> 00:11:28.447
to find the blacksmith rat''
hidden village.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.883
‐ Then why are you
still wearing that?

00:11:30.916 --> 00:11:35.087
‐ I found the village, but
everyone had been slaughtered.

00:11:35.087 --> 00:11:36.989
[music playing]

00:11:37.055 --> 00:11:39.458
As you know,
my Armor of the Iron‐rat

00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:41.493
and your Robe of the Fire‐rat

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.896
were created
in a blacksmith rats' workshop

00:11:43.896 --> 00:11:45.130
deep in the mountains.

00:11:46.431 --> 00:11:47.432
However...

00:11:48.567 --> 00:11:50.235
What happened here?

00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:52.204
[footsteps shuffling]

00:11:54.806 --> 00:11:55.874
[scoffs]

00:11:56.942 --> 00:11:57.943
[scoffs]

00:11:57.976 --> 00:11:59.778
‐ KONTON: Can't find it?
‐ [gasps]

00:11:59.811 --> 00:12:02.915
‐ Would this be the key that
you've been searching for...

00:12:02.948 --> 00:12:05.083
Yawaragi?

00:12:05.083 --> 00:12:07.085
‐ Was this your doing?

00:12:07.085 --> 00:12:10.155
‐ Rats are
such useless creatures.

00:12:10.222 --> 00:12:12.224
I didn't need to kill them,

00:12:12.257 --> 00:12:15.093
but I thought
it was just as well I did.

00:12:15.093 --> 00:12:16.862
‐ "It was just as well"?

00:12:16.895 --> 00:12:19.031
‐ Oh, on another matter,

00:12:19.064 --> 00:12:21.433
I hear the Armor of the Iron‐rat
you're wearing

00:12:21.466 --> 00:12:24.136
slowly shrinks
as the years go by.

00:12:24.203 --> 00:12:27.906
Eventually, a cursed piece
of armor like this one

00:12:27.906 --> 00:12:30.542
will shrink down
to the size of a rat,

00:12:30.576 --> 00:12:34.146
fatally crushing
the victim's body.

00:12:34.213 --> 00:12:35.948
‐ Just who are you, exactly?

00:12:35.981 --> 00:12:38.917
‐ A servant to Lord Kirinmaru.

00:12:38.951 --> 00:12:42.254
‐ You may address me
as Konton of the Four Perils.

00:12:42.287 --> 00:12:44.089
‐ Konton.

00:12:44.089 --> 00:12:47.793
‐ Although now
only two Perils remain.

00:12:47.826 --> 00:12:49.895
Would you happen
to know who it was

00:12:49.928 --> 00:12:52.464
that defeated Tokotsu,
one of our brethren,

00:12:52.531 --> 00:12:55.934
and then stole
the Red Rainbow Pearl from him?

00:12:55.968 --> 00:12:58.437
I think the answer
may surprise you.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:02.441
It was none other than your
beloved former student, Moroha.

00:13:02.474 --> 00:13:04.376
‐ [gasps] Moroha?

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:07.246
‐ I will give you
the key to that armor of yours,

00:13:07.246 --> 00:13:10.082
but only in exchange
for Moroha's head.

00:13:10.115 --> 00:13:12.217
Should you refuse my offer,

00:13:12.251 --> 00:13:14.786
then I will destroy this key
here and now.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.755
‐ Why don't
you just do it yourself?

00:13:16.788 --> 00:13:18.790
Why even involve me
in the first place?

00:13:18.824 --> 00:13:20.058
‐ [laughs]

00:13:20.092 --> 00:13:21.927
If Tokotsu were still alive,

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.063
he'd enjoy a showdown
between master and student.

00:13:25.097 --> 00:13:26.231
[laughs]

00:13:26.265 --> 00:13:28.800
‐ [sighs]

00:13:28.867 --> 00:13:29.902
‐ No way.

00:13:29.902 --> 00:13:31.904
Konton wants them to fight?

00:13:31.937 --> 00:13:33.105
‐ Deplorable.

00:13:33.138 --> 00:13:35.107
‐ That's honestly fine with me.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.376
It's not exactly
like I feel indebted to you

00:13:37.409 --> 00:13:39.044
in the first place, you know?

00:13:39.077 --> 00:13:40.412
So let's go ahead and give them

00:13:40.412 --> 00:13:42.414
the showdown
that they're asking for!

00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:44.116
‐ [chuckles] A fine response.

00:13:44.149 --> 00:13:46.818
This is the reason why you
were worthy of being my student.

00:13:46.885 --> 00:13:48.320
‐ [gasps]
‐ [gasps]

00:13:48.387 --> 00:13:50.289
‐ Don't help me out
on this one, guys.

00:13:50.322 --> 00:13:53.091
This is a fight
between myself and Yawaragi.

00:13:53.125 --> 00:13:56.228
‐ I heard that you have mastered
the Crimson Dragon Wave.

00:13:56.228 --> 00:13:57.763
But how strong is it, really,

00:13:57.796 --> 00:14:00.032
coming from a quarter‐demon
like you, I wonder.

00:14:00.065 --> 00:14:02.901
‐ Well, why don't I
go ahead and show you?

00:14:02.901 --> 00:14:05.103
‐ Crimson Dragon Wave!
‐ [dragon roars]

00:14:06.939 --> 00:14:07.873
‐ [yells]

00:14:08.941 --> 00:14:10.309
[groans]

00:14:10.375 --> 00:14:11.410
‐ Moroha!

00:14:11.443 --> 00:14:13.312
‐ Her technique was deflected.

00:14:13.378 --> 00:14:15.314
It seems brute force
isn't gonna be enough.

00:14:16.915 --> 00:14:18.917
‐ Fine. Let's see
how you handle this!

00:14:20.485 --> 00:14:22.387
‐ [scoffs]
Is that the best you've got?

00:14:22.421 --> 00:14:25.424
With spirit power this weak,
why not just hurl rocks?

00:14:27.159 --> 00:14:29.428
‐ Heavenly Arrow Barrage!

00:14:30.562 --> 00:14:32.731
[music playing]

00:14:34.366 --> 00:14:36.935
‐ Take this!

00:14:39.071 --> 00:14:40.138
‐ We're assisting you!

00:14:40.205 --> 00:14:41.907
‐ Yeah! I can't just stand by!

00:14:41.907 --> 00:14:43.475
‐ Don't butt in!

00:14:43.542 --> 00:14:46.378
I said this was
just between Yawaragi and me.

00:14:47.546 --> 00:14:49.815
‐ What?
You're resorting to that again?

00:14:49.882 --> 00:14:53.418
‐ You fool! If you let fear take
from it and drive your actions,

00:14:53.452 --> 00:14:55.153
you will only
be cheating yourself out

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.321
at the end of it all!

00:14:56.388 --> 00:14:57.789
Have you forgotten my teachings

00:14:57.823 --> 00:14:59.258
in overcoming that weakness?

00:14:59.258 --> 00:15:00.425
‐ Shut up!

00:15:00.425 --> 00:15:02.060
This is my power to use!

00:15:02.094 --> 00:15:03.529
‐ If you only excel at fighting,

00:15:03.562 --> 00:15:06.031
you're not a demon at all.
You're a monster!

00:15:06.064 --> 00:15:08.300
‐ [yelping]
‐ A monster that has no fear,

00:15:08.367 --> 00:15:11.403
but also cannot feel
physical or emotional pain

00:15:11.436 --> 00:15:13.205
and, therefore, is unable

00:15:13.238 --> 00:15:15.407
to understand
their opponent's pain, either.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.243
Such a pitiful creature
as that...

00:15:18.243 --> 00:15:19.411
‐ [yelps]

00:15:19.411 --> 00:15:21.213
‐ is better off dead!

00:15:23.215 --> 00:15:25.083
‐ Moroha!
‐ Hang on.

00:15:25.117 --> 00:15:28.153
It sounds like she's trying to
teach her an important lesson.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.155
‐ [groans]

00:15:30.222 --> 00:15:31.456
‐ Fine then. Go ahead,

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:33.792
and use the power
of your rouge if you want,

00:15:33.825 --> 00:15:35.690
but just remember
if you go through with it,

00:15:35.757 --> 00:15:38.326
that you'll be nothing more
than a soulless puppet.

00:15:39.594 --> 00:15:40.928
‐ [spits]

00:15:40.962 --> 00:15:41.963
<i>Without the rouge,</i>

00:15:41.996 --> 00:15:44.065
<i>I can't win</i>
<i>against her, though.</i>

00:15:44.098 --> 00:15:46.100
‐ How truly pitiful you are.

00:15:46.134 --> 00:15:47.468
You may be a quarter‐demon,

00:15:47.502 --> 00:15:49.604
but you're
still fully incomplete.

00:15:49.637 --> 00:15:53.141
At this rate, hope will always
be just outside your grasp.

00:15:53.174 --> 00:15:55.576
‐ [growls]

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:58.112
‐ [chuckles]
You haven't changed a bit.

00:15:58.112 --> 00:16:01.149
You're still the same Moroha
that I knew way back when.

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:04.118
‐ <i>What's she talking about?</i>

00:16:04.118 --> 00:16:06.587
YAWARAGI:
<i>Moroha, do not use your rouge!</i>

00:16:06.621 --> 00:16:08.289
‐ [wails]

00:16:08.289 --> 00:16:09.490
MOROHA: <i>She's right.</i>

00:16:09.557 --> 00:16:11.893
<i>I haven't changed</i>
<i>at all since then.</i>

00:16:16.064 --> 00:16:18.599
[growls]

00:16:18.599 --> 00:16:19.600
‐ Listen to me!

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.169
You have to fight against it!

00:16:21.235 --> 00:16:23.171
‐ [shrieks]
‐ [groans]

00:16:23.237 --> 00:16:25.173
‐ [shrieking]

00:16:25.239 --> 00:16:27.975
‐ [squawking]

00:16:28.009 --> 00:16:32.280
‐ [wails]

00:16:33.481 --> 00:16:34.615
‐ I got you.

00:16:34.615 --> 00:16:36.184
[birds squawking]

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:38.453
‐ Damn it. Reinforcements, huh?

00:16:38.486 --> 00:16:40.421
‐ Looks like you're
in a spot of trouble.

00:16:40.455 --> 00:16:41.622
‐ And who the hell are you?

00:16:41.622 --> 00:16:44.425
‐ Just a humble armor dealer
passing through.

00:16:44.459 --> 00:16:47.395
I saw that girl was wearing
the Robe of the Fire‐rat,

00:16:47.428 --> 00:16:51.099
so I thought I'd recommend this
Armor of the Iron‐rat to you.

00:16:51.099 --> 00:16:53.434
More demon power
and more defense.

00:16:53.434 --> 00:16:54.602
With this armor,

00:16:54.635 --> 00:16:57.171
those Birds of Paradise
will be no match for you.

00:16:57.238 --> 00:17:00.408
The only thing you have to do
is insert this key

00:17:00.441 --> 00:17:03.411
into the keyhole
located on my back here.

00:17:03.444 --> 00:17:05.113
‐ [squawking]

00:17:05.146 --> 00:17:07.448
‐ Hurry now.
The armor will shape itself

00:17:07.448 --> 00:17:09.984
to fit you perfectly,
so don't you worry.

00:17:10.017 --> 00:17:12.320
‐ Seems I don't have
much choice, do I?

00:17:12.353 --> 00:17:13.955
‐ Hope you enjoy!

00:17:20.428 --> 00:17:21.429
‐ Is this...

00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:23.631
‐ [laughs] Yes, I'm free!

00:17:23.664 --> 00:17:26.000
I was afraid that armor
was gonna crush me to death.

00:17:26.067 --> 00:17:27.301
‐ What are you talking about?

00:17:27.335 --> 00:17:28.603
‐ [laughs]

00:17:28.603 --> 00:17:30.004
If you don't wanna die,

00:17:30.071 --> 00:17:32.140
you'll have to pay someone
a rather handsome sum

00:17:32.173 --> 00:17:35.076
to get a new key made and
get that armor off your body.

00:17:35.109 --> 00:17:37.512
And you'll need to have
some poor sap unlock it for you,

00:17:37.578 --> 00:17:40.114
just like what you did for me!

00:17:40.148 --> 00:17:42.116
So this armor
was actually cursed?

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:44.619
‐ [squawking]

00:17:48.589 --> 00:17:50.591
‐ I feel my power is surging.

00:17:50.591 --> 00:17:52.660
So it really works, huh.

00:17:52.727 --> 00:17:55.663
Scattering Winds!

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:57.165
‐ [squawking]

00:18:05.273 --> 00:18:06.474
‐ <i>That's right.</i>

00:18:06.507 --> 00:18:09.277
<i>The armor,</i>
<i>the scars on her face,</i>

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:11.612
<i>they're all because of me.</i>

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.282
Your Scattering Winds attack

00:18:14.282 --> 00:18:16.284
was really something.

00:18:16.317 --> 00:18:19.692
‐ I see. So you
were remembering that day.

00:18:19.759 --> 00:18:21.461
‐ I won't use the rouge.

00:18:21.494 --> 00:18:24.764
I have to prove to myself
that I can beat you on my own

00:18:24.764 --> 00:18:27.634
without letting
the demon blood take control!

00:18:27.667 --> 00:18:29.736
‐ Hmph. Very well then!

00:18:29.769 --> 00:18:32.272
Let's move on to the final act
of our battle!

00:18:32.272 --> 00:18:33.773
‐ Final act?

00:18:33.773 --> 00:18:36.442
‐ I'm going to use
my Scattering Winds attack.

00:18:36.476 --> 00:18:37.510
Get ready.

00:18:37.577 --> 00:18:39.746
[Konton laughs]

00:18:39.779 --> 00:18:42.315
The moment
you kill your former pupil

00:18:42.348 --> 00:18:44.784
will be one that I relish
with great delight.

00:18:44.784 --> 00:18:48.288
This key here will then be
all yours for the taking.

00:18:48.288 --> 00:18:50.690
‐ [laughs]
‐ [growls]

00:18:50.757 --> 00:18:53.259
Go and laugh it up
while you still can.

00:18:53.293 --> 00:18:55.461
[wind blowing]

00:18:55.495 --> 00:18:56.429
‐ [grunts]

00:18:57.597 --> 00:18:59.265
OK, bring it on!

00:18:59.265 --> 00:19:01.634
‐ Moroha, this all ends here.

00:19:01.668 --> 00:19:04.137
Don't you dare let me
catch you holding back on me.

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:05.572
‐ I don't intend to.

00:19:05.605 --> 00:19:08.241
‐ Then here I go.

00:19:08.274 --> 00:19:11.344
Scattering Winds!

00:19:11.411 --> 00:19:13.913
[memory] <i>Don't lose faith.</i>
<i>You just have to use</i>

00:19:13.947 --> 00:19:16.316
<i>the extent of your imagination</i>
<i>to seize victory.</i>

00:19:16.349 --> 00:19:17.283
‐ [grunts]

00:19:20.787 --> 00:19:22.522
‐ What is she doing now?

00:19:24.624 --> 00:19:26.492
‐ [yells]

00:19:26.526 --> 00:19:29.128
‐ [dragon roars]
‐ Crimson Dragon Wave!

00:19:31.164 --> 00:19:33.499
YAWARAGI: <i>Well done, Moroha.</i>

00:19:33.566 --> 00:19:35.134
‐ [gasps] What in blazes...

00:19:35.168 --> 00:19:36.236
‐ This is the finale

00:19:36.269 --> 00:19:38.471
of the master‐student showdown
you wanted.

00:19:38.504 --> 00:19:40.840
I hope that your life
was worth the cost.

00:19:40.907 --> 00:19:42.342
‐ Foolish woman.

00:19:45.478 --> 00:19:46.646
[Rainbow Pearl chimes]

00:19:46.679 --> 00:19:48.648
‐ [gasps] What?!

00:19:53.286 --> 00:19:54.787
‐ Yawaragi!

00:19:56.623 --> 00:20:01.127
‐ Huh. The Blue Rainbow Pearl
was quite useful indeed,

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.562
unlike this.

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:05.231
‐ Damn you.

00:20:05.265 --> 00:20:06.232
Scourge of Swallows!

00:20:06.266 --> 00:20:09.235
‐ Until next time, half‐demons.

00:20:09.269 --> 00:20:10.603
‐ He got away from us.

00:20:10.637 --> 00:20:13.239
‐ What was that spell just now?

00:20:13.273 --> 00:20:16.242
‐ Hey, Master Yawaragi, get up!

00:20:16.276 --> 00:20:19.612
‐ You did well
out there, Moroha.

00:20:19.612 --> 00:20:23.650
What you saw was
the Crimson Backlash Wave.

00:20:23.683 --> 00:20:25.618
If you have learned that,

00:20:25.618 --> 00:20:28.588
then I can die
without any lingering regrets.

00:20:28.621 --> 00:20:30.323
‐ Don't talk like that!

00:20:31.524 --> 00:20:33.793
‐ Never lose sight of that‐‐

00:20:33.793 --> 00:20:36.429
that strength of heart, Moroha.

00:20:37.564 --> 00:20:39.599
‐ [gasps] Master Yawaragi!

00:20:39.632 --> 00:20:42.235
[music playing]

00:20:42.268 --> 00:20:44.270
No. You can't be gone.

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:46.506
[crying]

00:20:47.607 --> 00:20:49.609
Master!

00:20:49.642 --> 00:20:51.578
[sobbing]

00:20:53.146 --> 00:20:55.448
[music continues]

00:20:58.451 --> 00:21:00.520
What exactly am I, anyway?

00:21:00.587 --> 00:21:02.188
‐ Eh?

00:21:02.255 --> 00:21:04.324
‐ I'm not really a demon,

00:21:04.357 --> 00:21:05.692
not really a human.

00:21:05.758 --> 00:21:09.295
I mean, hell,
I'm not even a half‐demon.

00:21:09.329 --> 00:21:12.398
There's no place for me.

00:21:12.432 --> 00:21:14.500
That's why
I had to make one for myself,

00:21:14.567 --> 00:21:16.669
acting tough, causing a ruckus,

00:21:16.736 --> 00:21:19.672
doing whatever
I could to survive.

00:21:19.739 --> 00:21:22.442
I didn't know
any other way to live.

00:21:22.442 --> 00:21:24.644
The fact I've managed
to survive 'til now

00:21:24.677 --> 00:21:27.413
feels more like dumb luck
than anything.

00:21:27.447 --> 00:21:31.251
I don't really see that changing
for me anytime soon.

00:21:31.284 --> 00:21:33.620
‐ Well, that is a possibility.

00:21:33.653 --> 00:21:34.621
‐ Huh?

00:21:34.654 --> 00:21:37.123
‐ But it's never too late

00:21:37.156 --> 00:21:38.825
to change the path you lead.

00:21:38.858 --> 00:21:40.927
No matter
what might come your way,

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.596
how you want to live
is still up to you.

00:21:44.731 --> 00:21:45.899
‐ [chuckles]

00:21:45.932 --> 00:21:47.834
You got a point.

00:21:47.901 --> 00:21:50.403
TOWA: It's OK.
You're not alone anymore.

00:21:50.436 --> 00:21:53.139
We all have each other
to rely on now, don't we?

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:55.341
‐ We sure do.

00:21:57.243 --> 00:21:58.511
MOROHA: <i>Somehow...</i>

00:21:58.578 --> 00:22:02.081
<i>it felt completely natural</i>
<i>having these two at my sid.</i>

00:22:03.149 --> 00:22:04.417
<i>I hope...</i>

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:07.787
<i>you'd be proud of me for that,</i>
<i>Master Yawaragi.</i>

00:22:12.158 --> 00:22:14.093
[Japanese music playing]

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.075
TOWA: <i>We set off</i>
<i>to slay Totetsu,</i>

00:23:45.108 --> 00:23:47.110
<i>the demon who's been eating</i>
<i>virtuous monks,</i>

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:50.280
<i>but we end up falling</i>
<i>into Konton's strange trap.</i>

00:23:50.313 --> 00:23:52.949
SETSUNA: Towa, I want you
to cut me with your sword.

00:23:52.949 --> 00:23:54.951
TOWA: But why? I can't do that!

00:23:54.951 --> 00:23:57.254
MOROHA: How much deeper
does this valley go?

00:23:57.287 --> 00:23:58.989
What's going on?!

00:23:59.056 --> 00:24:00.924
KONTON: Enter through
the gate of opening,

00:24:00.957 --> 00:24:02.926
and end at the gate of death.

00:24:02.926 --> 00:24:05.629
TOWA: <i>Next time on</i> Yashahime,
<i>"Trap of the Two Perils."</i>

00:24:05.662 --> 00:24:07.998
RIKU: Let's see if they
can snatch the Rainbow Pearls

00:24:08.065 --> 00:24:09.766
from the Half‐Demon Princesses.
