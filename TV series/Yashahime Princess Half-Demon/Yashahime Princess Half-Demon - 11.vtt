You're saying that something

00:09:32.205 --> 00:09:33.974
‐ What do you think, Setsuna?
‐ Come on. Please?

00:09:34.007 --> 00:09:35.709
‐ Don't drag me into this.
‐ You gotta!

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:37.711
‐ [laughter]
‐ GRANDMA: Now, now.

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:39.345
‐ Seconds please, Grandma!

00:09:39.379 --> 00:09:40.346
‐ Yeah, me, too!

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.715
‐ [laughs] Alright.

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:46.019
‐ [sighs] Looks like we're
gonna end up spending the night.

00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:48.188
And they even shared
a warm meal with us.

00:09:48.221 --> 00:09:50.156
‐ Their home
is close to the pond.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.358
It's an ideal place to stay
for our mission.

00:09:52.392 --> 00:09:55.328
‐ Uh, now that you
mention that pond,

00:09:55.328 --> 00:09:58.665
it's been very murky and muddy
ever since I was a little girl.

00:09:58.665 --> 00:10:00.667
‐ I heard it
used to be really clear,

00:10:00.701 --> 00:10:02.603
that the surface
was so clean and pure,

00:10:02.669 --> 00:10:03.704
it was like a mirror.

00:10:03.737 --> 00:10:05.572
‐ That's right.

00:10:05.606 --> 00:10:07.741
It was all thanks to the sage.

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:11.578
She used some medicinal herbs
to purify those filthy waters.

00:10:11.612 --> 00:10:13.514
‐ A sage, you say?

00:10:13.547 --> 00:10:14.781
‐ She used herbs?

00:10:14.848 --> 00:10:16.249
‐ Yes, indeed.

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:18.785
She then planted more
medicinal herbs around the pond

00:10:18.852 --> 00:10:20.621
so if it became murky again,

00:10:20.687 --> 00:10:22.556
they could be used
to clear it up.

00:10:22.589 --> 00:10:24.525
There should be
a big, beautiful patch

00:10:24.525 --> 00:10:27.694
of medicinal herbs
growing over there by now.

00:10:27.728 --> 00:10:30.396
‐ But no one can reach it
because of the Venom Serpent,

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.098
so there's no way
to clear the pond.

00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:33.466
‐ Venom Serpent?

00:10:33.534 --> 00:10:35.268
‐ It's a demon that's poisonous

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:37.203
and looks like a giant snake.

00:10:37.237 --> 00:10:39.205
‐ It looks
like a giant snake, huh?

00:10:39.239 --> 00:10:40.206
Have you seen it?

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.207
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

00:10:41.241 --> 00:10:42.308
[both grunt]

00:10:44.277 --> 00:10:46.813
‐ [gasps] Hey, what is that,

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.314
that case over there?

00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:49.616
‐ Setsuna.

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:51.117
‐ An instrument.

00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:52.619
‐ [squeals]

00:10:52.653 --> 00:10:55.121
‐ [groans]

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:58.391
‐ Ooh! What a funny shape!

00:10:58.391 --> 00:10:59.626
‐ Is it like a biwa lute?

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.629
Our Pa was good
at playing the biwa, too.

00:11:02.663 --> 00:11:05.331
‐ He always
used to play it for us.

00:11:05.398 --> 00:11:06.432
‐ Did he, now?

00:11:06.466 --> 00:11:08.835
‐ Setsuna's instrument
is called a violin.

00:11:08.902 --> 00:11:10.336
BOTH: Bio‐lin?

00:11:10.403 --> 00:11:11.772
‐ [gasps] Will you play?

00:11:11.805 --> 00:11:13.239
‐ I wanna hear!

00:11:13.273 --> 00:11:15.408
‐ But I don't play it
very well at all.

00:11:15.408 --> 00:11:17.778
‐ Please, if it wouldn't
be too much trouble,

00:11:17.811 --> 00:11:20.581
play a song
for my dear grandchildren.

00:11:20.614 --> 00:11:21.815
‐ [chuckles]

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:23.416
[both squeal]

00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:25.351
‐ Uh...

00:11:25.418 --> 00:11:26.486
[sighs]

00:11:29.255 --> 00:11:30.791
[children laugh]

00:11:30.824 --> 00:11:32.693
[playing sentimental music]

00:11:41.668 --> 00:11:44.204
[both crying]

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.171
‐ [stops playing]
‐ Eh?

00:11:47.641 --> 00:11:49.776
‐ Uh, hey,
what's the matter, you two?

00:11:49.776 --> 00:11:51.444
‐ Oh, dear.

00:11:51.444 --> 00:11:53.279
[children crying]

00:11:53.313 --> 00:11:56.783
They're just remembering
their father.

00:11:56.783 --> 00:11:58.785
‐ He played for us
with his biwa

00:11:58.819 --> 00:12:00.621
over by that old pond.

00:12:00.654 --> 00:12:03.624
That's when
he got swallowed up.

00:12:03.657 --> 00:12:05.626
[crying]

00:12:05.659 --> 00:12:07.528
GRANDMA: There now.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.707
‐ [gasps]

00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:28.649
Setsuna.

00:12:31.818 --> 00:12:33.486
Sorry, Setsuna.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.389
I didn't mean
to fall asleep on my own.

00:12:36.422 --> 00:12:37.724
‐ Don't worry about it.

00:12:37.758 --> 00:12:38.659
It's alright.

00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:41.662
‐ Nights are probably long

00:12:41.662 --> 00:12:43.664
when you can't sleep,
aren't they?

00:12:43.697 --> 00:12:47.868
But I promise I'm gonna catch
the Dream Butterfly for you.

00:12:47.901 --> 00:12:49.570
‐ It's the way it is.

00:12:49.603 --> 00:12:52.606
Ever since I can remember,
this is how it's been,

00:12:52.673 --> 00:12:55.375
so it's never been
a hardship for me.

00:12:55.408 --> 00:12:57.544
And if I wait out here,

00:12:57.578 --> 00:12:59.580
the sun will eventually rise.

00:12:59.613 --> 00:13:01.281
‐ Setsuna.

00:13:01.347 --> 00:13:03.884
‐ By the way, I've been
thinking about what Moroha said.

00:13:03.917 --> 00:13:04.885
‐ Eh?

00:13:04.918 --> 00:13:06.853
‐ When she told us
about the bird,

00:13:06.853 --> 00:13:09.890
why did she say
the "pond" swallowed it?

00:13:09.923 --> 00:13:11.892
‐ You're right.

00:13:11.925 --> 00:13:13.860
If you had watched
something get eaten,

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.395
you'd note what had done it,

00:13:15.428 --> 00:13:18.198
like a snake
or some other creature.

00:13:18.231 --> 00:13:19.600
‐ Well, in any case...

00:13:19.633 --> 00:13:21.434
go get some sleep.

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:24.437
Come the morning, we'll have
to slay the Venom Serpent.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:27.373
‐ [chuckles] Well,
maybe I'll sleep out here then.

00:13:27.373 --> 00:13:29.242
Good night.

00:13:29.275 --> 00:13:30.877
Ow!

00:13:30.911 --> 00:13:32.212
[groans]

00:13:32.245 --> 00:13:34.548
‐ Don't start
getting comfortable with me.

00:13:34.581 --> 00:13:35.549
Hmph!

00:13:36.082 --> 00:13:37.718
‐ [scoffs]

00:13:40.821 --> 00:13:42.623
[birds squawking]

00:13:42.623 --> 00:13:44.424
MOROHA: Aw, man.

00:13:44.457 --> 00:13:46.426
Where the hell are those two?

00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:48.061
They didn't
come home last night,

00:13:48.094 --> 00:13:49.630
so now I gotta find 'em.

00:13:49.663 --> 00:13:51.932
Towa! Setsuna!

00:13:51.965 --> 00:13:54.635
Eh? Oh, there they are.

00:13:54.635 --> 00:13:57.003
‐ Hey, you two!
‐ Eh?

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:58.471
Moroha.

00:13:58.471 --> 00:14:00.574
‐ Man, where in the world
have you been?

00:14:00.607 --> 00:14:01.942
You didn't come home last night.

00:14:01.975 --> 00:14:03.977
I got worried
and had to find you.

00:14:03.977 --> 00:14:07.648
‐ Sorry. A couple of kids from
the village let us stay over.

00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:08.815
‐ Kids from the village?

00:14:08.815 --> 00:14:10.817
‐ There's no time to explain.

00:14:10.851 --> 00:14:12.919
TOWA: A demon
called the Venom Serpent

00:14:12.953 --> 00:14:14.655
is living in this pond.

00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:17.457
‐ Venom Serpent? So the thing
I saw yesterday was...

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:19.626
‐ Yeah, we're pretty sure
that's what it was.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.828
We were planning
on slaying it today.

00:14:21.828 --> 00:14:23.930
‐ What?! Then I wanna help you!

00:14:23.964 --> 00:14:27.100
Yeah! Time to get
that sweet, sweet bounty.

00:14:27.133 --> 00:14:29.503
I never want to clean
another grimy room

00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:31.037
for as long as I live!

00:14:31.104 --> 00:14:35.542
Yo, Venom Serpent!
Come on out here! Get ready.

00:14:35.609 --> 00:14:38.478
I'm sending you to the afterlife
with my Kurikaramaru!

00:14:38.512 --> 00:14:40.446
‐ Don't give away our position!

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.447
‐ [grunts]

00:14:41.481 --> 00:14:43.850
‐ [chuckles]

00:14:43.884 --> 00:14:45.852
‐ [energy surges]
‐ Hmm? Look.

00:14:50.524 --> 00:14:52.559
‐ So there you are,
Venom Serpent.

00:14:52.626 --> 00:14:54.561
Crimson Dragon Wave!

00:14:54.628 --> 00:14:55.696
[dragon roars]

00:14:58.865 --> 00:15:00.333
[gasps]

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:03.837
[coughing]

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:05.539
I can't breathe.

00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:07.541
Could it be demon toxin?

00:15:07.541 --> 00:15:09.042
TOWA: Moroha, watch out!

00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:12.679
‐ Yaah!

00:15:13.747 --> 00:15:14.715
‐ Moroha!

00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:16.650
‐ Don't get distracted.
‐ [gasps]

00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:20.486
[both gasp]

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:27.994
TOWA: So is this
the Venom Serpent?

00:15:28.028 --> 00:15:31.565
‐ Tell me, are you the ones
threatening this pond?

00:15:31.598 --> 00:15:32.766
‐ Wait. It can talk?

00:15:32.833 --> 00:15:33.767
[gasps]

00:15:33.834 --> 00:15:35.769
Setsuna, be careful!

00:15:35.836 --> 00:15:38.539
‐ Scourge of Swallows!

00:15:39.606 --> 00:15:42.776
‐ You annoying little brat! Die!

00:15:45.512 --> 00:15:47.714
‐ [grunts]
‐ [yells]

00:15:47.748 --> 00:15:48.915
‐ [shrieks]

00:15:48.915 --> 00:15:51.084
‐ Are you OK, Setsuna?

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:52.753
‐ Yeah, I think so.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.690
‐ [coughing]

00:15:56.723 --> 00:15:58.024
‐ [slurps]

00:15:58.058 --> 00:16:00.093
Lady Moroha, are you alright?

00:16:00.093 --> 00:16:01.094
‐ Ouch!

00:16:01.094 --> 00:16:02.929
[sighs]

00:16:02.963 --> 00:16:05.131
I don't know how,
but I'm still alive.

00:16:05.198 --> 00:16:06.967
Uh, what the?

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:09.102
The itchiness just went away.

00:16:09.102 --> 00:16:11.905
‐ [laughs] Oh, that's probably
thanks to this herb here.

00:16:11.938 --> 00:16:13.473
‐ An herb?

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.041
‐ [groans]

00:16:15.075 --> 00:16:16.743
[panting]

00:16:16.777 --> 00:16:19.045
‐ Hey, are you sure you're OK?

00:16:19.079 --> 00:16:23.216
‐ Towa, why aren't you being
affected by its demon toxin?

00:16:23.249 --> 00:16:25.552
‐ You're right. I have no idea.

00:16:25.586 --> 00:16:28.121
Since that's the case,
I'll handle this.

00:16:28.121 --> 00:16:30.957
Venom Serpent,
I'm taking you on!

00:16:30.991 --> 00:16:33.727
‐ [growling]

00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:37.831
‐ It's like
the pond itself is alive.

00:16:43.103 --> 00:16:45.639
‐ The pond is protecting
the Venom Serpent?!

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:46.807
‐ The Venom Serpent

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.642
isn't the only opponent
you must defeat.

00:16:48.675 --> 00:16:51.845
The pond itself is also a demon.

00:16:51.912 --> 00:16:53.113
‐ [groans]

00:16:53.146 --> 00:16:54.247
‐ Eh, look!

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.148
Down there!

00:16:57.818 --> 00:16:58.985
‐ What's that?

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:01.154
‐ Must be all the bodies
of those who drowned here.

00:17:05.592 --> 00:17:07.160
‐ I am Drifting Pond.

00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:09.530
I drift from pond to pond,

00:17:09.596 --> 00:17:11.998
consume it, and then
become the pond itself.

00:17:11.998 --> 00:17:13.800
‐ Drifting Pond, huh?

00:17:13.834 --> 00:17:16.202
That's the demon
that I spotted yesterday.

00:17:16.269 --> 00:17:18.872
‐ Taking on Venom Serpent
and Drifting Pond at once

00:17:18.939 --> 00:17:20.507
will make this a tough battle.

00:17:20.541 --> 00:17:22.509
‐ Then I'd better help.

00:17:22.543 --> 00:17:24.177
[groans]

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:28.014
‐ Lady Moroha, you're not
immune to demon toxin.

00:17:28.048 --> 00:17:31.017
Even if you went to help them,
you'd do more harm than good.

00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:33.019
‐ I gotta do something.

00:17:33.019 --> 00:17:37.190
‐ How dare you endanger
the resident of this pond?!

00:17:37.223 --> 00:17:38.191
Die!

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:39.860
‐ I'll show you!

00:17:39.893 --> 00:17:40.894
[yells]

00:17:43.196 --> 00:17:44.565
Yes, I got 'im!

00:17:46.366 --> 00:17:48.201
[gasps]

00:17:48.201 --> 00:17:50.303
‐ Towa, what's wrong?

00:17:50.336 --> 00:17:52.205
‐ I don't know.

00:17:52.205 --> 00:17:53.874
It's like my body suddenly‐‐

00:17:53.874 --> 00:17:55.576
[coughs]

00:17:55.642 --> 00:17:56.710
‐ What happened?

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:59.045
Did the demon toxin
dissolve into the water?

00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:00.313
‐ Except...
‐ [coughing]

00:18:00.346 --> 00:18:04.317
it's only affecting Towa
this time. But why?

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:05.852
‐ Ah. Yes, I see.

00:18:05.886 --> 00:18:07.821
Those two are resistant
to the toxin,

00:18:07.854 --> 00:18:09.756
but each has
a different type of immunity.

00:18:09.823 --> 00:18:11.091
‐ What do you mean by that?

00:18:11.157 --> 00:18:14.895
‐ Apparently Lady Towa
has a resistance to poison mist,

00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:17.898
while Lady Setsuna
has a resistance to venom.

00:18:17.898 --> 00:18:19.332
[Moroha gasps]

00:18:19.365 --> 00:18:22.102
‐ Just as one would expect from
Lord Sesshomaru's daughters.

00:18:22.168 --> 00:18:26.039
All they must do now is properly
utilize their advantages.

00:18:26.072 --> 00:18:27.941
‐ Are you able to move, Towa?

00:18:28.008 --> 00:18:29.743
‐ Uh‐huh. I'll be alright.

00:18:33.179 --> 00:18:36.249
‐ You insolent little girls,
I will never forgive you.

00:18:36.249 --> 00:18:39.385
SETSUNA: Drifting Pond
and Venom Serpent

00:18:39.419 --> 00:18:40.854
both at the same time.

00:18:40.887 --> 00:18:42.255
This'll be tough.

00:18:42.255 --> 00:18:43.857
‐ We're gonna be fine.
‐ Huh?

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:45.926
‐ It is two against two,
after all.

00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:47.928
‐ [gasps]

00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:49.863
‐ [growls]

00:18:51.397 --> 00:18:52.633
[both grunt]

00:18:52.699 --> 00:18:53.634
‐ [gasps]

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.268
Is that a...

00:18:55.268 --> 00:18:56.770
biwa?

00:18:57.904 --> 00:18:58.872
[gasps]

00:18:58.905 --> 00:19:01.074
‐ <i>It was all thanks to the sage.</i>

00:19:01.107 --> 00:19:04.778
<i>She used medicinal herbs</i>
<i>to purify those filthy waters.</i>

00:19:04.778 --> 00:19:08.114
‐ That's right! There's
a patch of medicinal herbs.

00:19:08.148 --> 00:19:10.951
‐ What is it, Setsuna? Setsuna?!

00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:13.887
‐ Towa, you can leave
Drifting Pond to me.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.156
You handle the Venom Serpent.

00:19:16.222 --> 00:19:17.157
‐ Understood.

00:19:17.223 --> 00:19:19.225
DRIFTING POND:
You won't escape!

00:19:22.095 --> 00:19:23.096
‐ [gasps]

00:19:23.129 --> 00:19:25.431
Lady Setsuna
is heading straight for us.

00:19:25.465 --> 00:19:28.434
MOROHA: You're right.
What's going on?

00:19:28.468 --> 00:19:30.937
‐ You had better
dodge this, Moroha.

00:19:35.776 --> 00:19:38.011
Cyclone Burst!

00:19:38.078 --> 00:19:40.246
‐ [yelling]

00:19:46.853 --> 00:19:49.255
‐ [grunts]

00:19:49.289 --> 00:19:52.759
[yells]

00:19:53.827 --> 00:19:54.961
[Venom Serpent groans]

00:19:54.995 --> 00:19:56.797
DRIFTING POND:
What are you doing?!

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:59.299
‐ If these are the medicinal
herbs from the sage,

00:19:59.332 --> 00:20:02.335
then they should purify you,
since you're sullying the pond.

00:20:03.436 --> 00:20:04.705
‐ Check it out!

00:20:04.771 --> 00:20:06.306
The water in the pond
is clearing up!

00:20:06.339 --> 00:20:09.876
‐ [groans]

00:20:09.943 --> 00:20:11.845
‐ [gasps] Drifting Pond.

00:20:11.845 --> 00:20:14.347
‐ Towa, the rest is up to you!

00:20:14.347 --> 00:20:15.682
‐ I'm on it!

00:20:17.283 --> 00:20:20.353
[yells]

00:20:20.386 --> 00:20:22.155
‐ [grunts]

00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:29.162
‐ Sorry, but your mist
doesn't work on me!

00:20:32.398 --> 00:20:36.169
‐ [gasps] Drifting... Pond.

00:20:41.307 --> 00:20:43.209
‐ [panting]

00:20:47.514 --> 00:20:48.882
[chuckles]

00:20:53.319 --> 00:20:55.055
[babbles]

00:20:55.088 --> 00:20:57.023
‐ You two are so awesome!

00:20:57.057 --> 00:20:59.325
You managed to get them both
at the same time!

00:20:59.359 --> 00:21:00.326
‐ High‐five!

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.828
‐ Oh, yeah!

00:21:01.862 --> 00:21:03.396
‐ Setsuna, up top!

00:21:03.396 --> 00:21:04.731
‐ Yeah.

00:21:04.765 --> 00:21:05.732
[sighs]

00:21:05.766 --> 00:21:07.233
‐ What? Don't you wanna?

00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:08.502
‐ You're so annoying.

00:21:08.535 --> 00:21:11.071
‐ [gasps] Aw, come on.

00:21:11.104 --> 00:21:12.172
‐ [chuckles]

00:21:12.205 --> 00:21:13.339
Would you look at that?

00:21:13.373 --> 00:21:16.242
This pond
is so pretty and clear.

00:21:16.242 --> 00:21:17.844
‐ TOWA: Yep.
‐ SETSUNA: It is.

00:21:17.878 --> 00:21:19.546
CHIYO: Hey, Towa!

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.248
TOWA: Oh.
It's Chiyo and Hikomaru.

00:21:23.584 --> 00:21:24.885
‐ [laughing]

00:21:24.918 --> 00:21:26.119
‐ [laughs]

00:21:26.186 --> 00:21:27.554
‐ Here. You forgot this.

00:21:27.588 --> 00:21:29.055
‐ Thank you.

00:21:30.591 --> 00:21:32.926
‐ Oh, wow! So pretty.

00:21:32.926 --> 00:21:34.127
‐ Yeah, isn't it?
‐ Huh?

00:21:34.194 --> 00:21:35.896
‐ I could totally drink it now.

00:21:35.929 --> 00:21:38.131
‐ Right.
Unlike last time, you mean?

00:21:38.198 --> 00:21:39.265
[both laugh]

00:21:41.602 --> 00:21:43.103
‐ You three defeated that thing.

00:21:43.103 --> 00:21:44.938
That's why the pond's
so clear, isn't it?

00:21:44.971 --> 00:21:47.273
‐ Thank you.
‐ [laughs]

00:21:47.273 --> 00:21:49.042
‐ No need to thank us.

00:21:52.478 --> 00:21:55.749
I know it's not a biwa,
but I'll do my best to play.

00:21:56.917 --> 00:21:58.952
‐ [sighs]

00:22:12.298 --> 00:22:14.234
[Japanese music playing]

00:23:43.189 --> 00:23:46.426
NIKOSEN: Some mere half‐demons
have Rainbow Pearls?

00:23:46.492 --> 00:23:50.230
You think that I, Nikosen,
being both demon and human,

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:53.066
am best suited
for disposing of them.

00:23:53.099 --> 00:23:54.901
KONTON: See to it
that you defeat them.

00:23:54.935 --> 00:23:56.503
TOWA: <i>In a battle</i>
<i>against a demon</i>

00:23:56.537 --> 00:23:59.372
<i>that withered a mountain,</i>
<i>I end up holding us all back.</i>

00:23:59.405 --> 00:24:01.241
SETSUNA: What's wrong
with you today, Towa?

00:24:01.241 --> 00:24:03.076
MOROHA: I don't sense
any demon energy.

00:24:03.109 --> 00:24:04.711
It's like you're just a human!

00:24:04.745 --> 00:24:06.513
TOWA: Next time on Yashahime,

00:24:06.547 --> 00:24:07.948
<i>"Night of the New Moon</i>
<i>and the Black‐haired Towa."</i>

00:24:08.014 --> 00:24:11.251
I'm really sorry
for troubling everyone.
