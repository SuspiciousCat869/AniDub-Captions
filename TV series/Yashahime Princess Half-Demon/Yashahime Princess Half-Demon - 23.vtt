MR. KIRIN: Well, now,
if it isn't Mr. Higurashi!

00:00:42.084 --> 00:00:44.355
Funny bumping into you here.

00:00:44.422 --> 00:00:47.294
‐ Oh, hi. I'm sorry.
Have we met somewhere?

00:00:47.328 --> 00:00:50.367
‐ I'm Osamu Kirin,
Miss Towa's homeroom teacher.

00:00:50.434 --> 00:00:51.503
It's been a while.

00:00:51.537 --> 00:00:53.541
‐ That's right.
You're Towa's teacher.

00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:55.812
‐ Hi, Mr. Kirin.
It's very nice to meet you.

00:00:55.845 --> 00:00:58.350
‐ Speaking of Miss Towa,
is she feeling better?

00:00:58.383 --> 00:01:00.555
Since she transferred
at the start of the semester,

00:01:00.622 --> 00:01:01.624
she's been absent.

00:01:01.657 --> 00:01:03.126
‐ Yeah, thing is,

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:05.565
her neuralgia
has subsided a bit, thankfully,

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:06.834
but her rheumatism, well...

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:09.171
‐ Ah. I do hope
she gets well soon.

00:01:09.205 --> 00:01:10.440
‐ MOE: I'm back!
‐ Hmm?

00:01:10.474 --> 00:01:12.444
‐ Oh, I've missed
you two so much!

00:01:12.478 --> 00:01:14.215
‐ Welcome home, sweetie.
‐ Welcome home, Mommy!

00:01:14.282 --> 00:01:16.386
‐ Mr. Kirin!
What a nice surprise.

00:01:16.452 --> 00:01:18.858
I hope Towa hasn't been causing
too much trouble for you.

00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:19.860
‐ No, not at all.

00:01:19.893 --> 00:01:21.830
‐ Mommy, did you
bring me a gift?

00:01:21.864 --> 00:01:23.834
‐ Yes, of course.
I have it right here!

00:01:23.868 --> 00:01:27.408
‐ Apples! Towa's favorite!
They look so yummy...

00:01:27.408 --> 00:01:29.412
‐ It's gotten
quite a bit closer, hasn't it?

00:01:29.478 --> 00:01:30.414
‐ Huh?

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.418
‐ The first in 500 years,
I think.

00:01:32.418 --> 00:01:34.355
‐ Uh, what do you mean?

00:01:34.388 --> 00:01:37.428
‐ Well, I haven't really
kept up with all the details,

00:01:37.494 --> 00:01:39.866
but what I've heard
is there's a comet

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.574
that approaches the Earth
around every 470 years or so.

00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:46.179
‐ Oh, yeah. I think
I remember hearing about it

00:01:46.212 --> 00:01:47.515
on the news pretty recently.

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.485
But I don't think
it's supposed to be visible

00:01:49.519 --> 00:01:51.089
to the naked eye just yet.

00:01:52.257 --> 00:01:53.828
I'm not seeing anything.

00:01:53.861 --> 00:01:57.736
‐ <i>Interesting.</i>
<i>So a normal person</i>

00:01:57.769 --> 00:02:00.107
<i>isn't even able</i>
<i>to see a trace of it.</i>

00:02:02.344 --> 00:02:04.248
KIRINMARU: I see.

00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:07.354
So it does appear
in that other era as well.

00:02:09.225 --> 00:02:11.697
Then I suppose
something must be done about it.

‐ [laughs]

00:04:09.465 --> 00:04:12.572
Nothing will ever stop me
from being who I am.

00:04:12.572 --> 00:04:15.310
That is what you wanted.
Right, My Lord?

00:04:16.412 --> 00:04:18.416
Now then, all that's left

00:04:18.416 --> 00:04:21.824
is to figure out what to do
about the other half‐demon girl.

00:04:21.857 --> 00:04:23.561
Riku.

00:04:23.594 --> 00:04:24.663
‐ Yes, madam?

00:04:24.696 --> 00:04:27.401
‐ You already have
the information I seek.

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:30.541
Now tell me what I must do to
make the other half‐demon twin

00:04:30.575 --> 00:04:32.411
manifest her true powers.

00:04:32.478 --> 00:04:34.649
‐ Are you talking
about Lady Towa?

00:04:34.683 --> 00:04:37.387
‐ Who else would I
possibly be talking about?

00:04:37.421 --> 00:04:40.260
‐ Right. Well, Lady Towa is,

00:04:40.327 --> 00:04:43.366
how should I say, someone
too kind for her own good.

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:45.437
‐ Very interesting.

00:04:45.505 --> 00:04:48.577
So that's what it takes
for her to release her powers.

00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:50.781
RIKU: So I highly doubt
she possesses

00:04:50.848 --> 00:04:52.919
the destructive power
you're looking for.

00:04:52.952 --> 00:04:54.723
‐ Really?

00:04:54.756 --> 00:04:58.463
Well, I'll just have to take
your word for it, won't I?

00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:01.737
‐ Yes. I'm sorry
I couldn't be of more use.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.279
‐ Don't apologize. We both know
you've always been a bad liar.

00:05:06.345 --> 00:05:08.016
Well, it's no matter.

00:05:08.049 --> 00:05:09.786
I'll make some tea.

00:05:09.786 --> 00:05:11.255
You should have some.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.034
‐ [snoring]

00:05:18.136 --> 00:05:20.608
JYUBEI: Hmm.
From the looks of it,

00:05:20.641 --> 00:05:22.477
this is a Blood Blade.

00:05:22.477 --> 00:05:23.479
SETSUNA: A Blood Blade?

00:05:23.547 --> 00:05:25.116
‐ What does that even mean?

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.920
‐ If the two of you are indeed

00:05:26.954 --> 00:05:29.124
the half‐demon daughters
of Sesshomaru,

00:05:29.158 --> 00:05:31.495
that means you girls
have also inherited

00:05:31.563 --> 00:05:33.499
your father's blood
as a great demon.

00:05:33.567 --> 00:05:35.905
A wealth of power
flows through your veins,

00:05:35.938 --> 00:05:38.777
granting abilities
like poison claws,

00:05:38.811 --> 00:05:41.817
blades of blood,
or demon energy blades.

00:05:41.884 --> 00:05:44.823
Some great demons can
even create powerful weapons.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.094
Well, that's what
I hear, anyway.

00:05:47.127 --> 00:05:48.664
‐ "That's what you hear"?

00:05:48.664 --> 00:05:50.935
Doesn't sound like you're
too sure about this yourself.

00:05:50.968 --> 00:05:52.437
‐ What do you expect?

00:05:52.471 --> 00:05:55.076
I've never seen one with
my own eyes before, you know.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.147
‐ So this blade is a part of me.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.483
‐ Yeah, I guess so.

00:05:58.517 --> 00:05:59.686
‐ How do I use it?

00:05:59.686 --> 00:06:02.124
‐ Only your own blood
can answer that one.

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:12.411
‐ Hey, there. How you two doin'
this fine day?

00:06:12.444 --> 00:06:14.583
And a good morning to you,
Mr. Jyubei.

00:06:14.616 --> 00:06:17.087
Got any juicy
bounty hunting jobs for me?

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.795
‐ Maybe not juicy, but there
is one job that's open.

00:06:20.828 --> 00:06:23.801
Some nice people have requested
to hire you specifically.

00:06:23.834 --> 00:06:25.771
‐ Oh, yeah?
Where are these folks?

00:06:25.805 --> 00:06:27.642
‐ We're right here.
‐ It's us two.

00:06:27.675 --> 00:06:29.478
‐ Eh?
‐ We need your help.

00:06:29.512 --> 00:06:31.550
You can have our share
of Totetsu's bounty,

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.552
every last bit of it.

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:34.856
‐ You two want to hire me?

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:36.994
What part of hell froze over
for this to happen?

00:06:37.027 --> 00:06:37.996

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:40.568
We got what you wanted.

00:06:40.635 --> 00:06:43.172
‐ Azusa no Yumihari,
like you asked.

00:06:43.206 --> 00:06:45.377
What do you think?
Does it have her scent?

00:06:45.443 --> 00:06:47.114
‐ [sniffs] It sure does.

00:06:47.147 --> 00:06:50.053
I would recognize that woman's
demon stench anywhere.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.558
‐ Now we'll know
exactly where to find her.

00:06:52.625 --> 00:06:54.028
‐ Wait. "That woman"?

00:06:54.061 --> 00:06:55.196
You mean we're gonna...

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.566
‐ That's right, Moroha.

00:06:56.633 --> 00:06:59.038
Once dawn breaks,
we're going to slay Zero.

00:06:59.071 --> 00:07:00.473
‐ Whoa.

00:07:00.508 --> 00:07:02.879
‐ I'm going to make her regret
what she did to me.

00:07:02.912 --> 00:07:04.148
She's going to pay big time.

00:07:04.181 --> 00:07:06.152
[Hisui grunts]

00:07:06.185 --> 00:07:09.859
‐ Alright, then! Let's go
take that old bag's head!

00:07:15.972 --> 00:07:17.875
‐ It has been quite some time

00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:19.846
since we last met,
Your Ladyship.

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:23.486
‐ Ah, Kirinmaru.
It has been too long.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.756
Are you doing well?

00:07:24.756 --> 00:07:26.192
‐ I'm fine, yes.

00:07:26.225 --> 00:07:28.731
And it's wonderful to see
your Ladyship's beauty

00:07:28.764 --> 00:07:30.868
only continues
to grow with time.

00:07:30.901 --> 00:07:33.072
‐ There's no need for flattery.

00:07:33.106 --> 00:07:35.945
And please, do stop
calling me by that title.

00:07:36.012 --> 00:07:38.684
It stopped being appropriate
long ago.

00:07:38.717 --> 00:07:40.554
‐ It would appear that my sister

00:07:40.588 --> 00:07:42.190
has been giving you
some trouble.

00:07:42.224 --> 00:07:45.096
‐ That Zero hasn't changed
one bit, has she?

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.034
She seems to be meddling
in the affairs

00:07:47.067 --> 00:07:49.238
of Sesshomaru's
half‐demon daughters,

00:07:49.271 --> 00:07:51.576
but I struggle
to understand why.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.580
‐ I'm afraid there's no excuse.

00:07:53.614 --> 00:07:56.687
‐ Well, she may continue
to do as she pleases.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.060
What happens to those girls
is not my slightest concern.

00:08:00.093 --> 00:08:01.963
Besides,
a half‐demon's true worth

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.701
must be proven
through survival.

00:08:03.734 --> 00:08:05.971
‐ I am glad to hear that.

00:08:06.038 --> 00:08:09.044
Since they have gone and
decided to make me their target,

00:08:09.078 --> 00:08:12.618
I'm afraid I cannot go easy
on them when next we clash.

00:08:13.787 --> 00:08:14.923
By the way...

00:08:14.956 --> 00:08:18.129
has the Windmill of Time
moved at all?

00:08:18.162 --> 00:08:21.168
‐ As far as I can tell, no.

00:08:21.235 --> 00:08:24.709
And it's been several years
since I last laid eyes on Akuru.

00:08:24.743 --> 00:08:26.245
‐ I had thought as much.

00:08:26.278 --> 00:08:28.784
Your son is also searching
for Akuru's pinwheel,

00:08:28.817 --> 00:08:30.220
but with no success.

00:08:30.253 --> 00:08:31.823
‐ [chuckles]

00:08:31.823 --> 00:08:33.727
Given what he
has gotten himself into,

00:08:33.761 --> 00:08:35.631
I'd say it's a fitting pastime.

00:08:35.664 --> 00:08:39.304
‐ Though I agree, I suspect
Sesshomaru's true intention

00:08:39.338 --> 00:08:41.075
is to take care
of his daughters.

00:08:41.108 --> 00:08:43.947
‐ But what you suggest
is impossible.

00:08:43.981 --> 00:08:47.187
Something like that would
almost make him seem human.

00:08:47.187 --> 00:08:48.690
‐ That is true.

00:08:57.975 --> 00:08:59.178
‐ OK. See you.

00:08:59.178 --> 00:09:01.850
And good luck beating
that mean ol' demon lady.

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:02.785
[both grunt]

00:09:07.662 --> 00:09:09.031

00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:11.102
‐ In all my years on this world

00:09:11.135 --> 00:09:13.707
and all the opponents
I have faced,

00:09:13.774 --> 00:09:16.813
you are by far the most
perplexing of them all.

00:09:16.847 --> 00:09:19.218
You are
one truly peculiar girl.

00:09:19.218 --> 00:09:20.988
‐ Is that so? Thanks.

00:09:21.021 --> 00:09:22.892
I'll be taking that
as a compliment!

00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:24.228
‐ Show your strength,

00:09:24.228 --> 00:09:26.967
and reveal to me
your hidden demon powers

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.173
so I may judge your
latent abilities for myself.

00:09:30.206 --> 00:09:32.210
‐ I knew you'd be here.

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.216
Your scent really gave away
your connection to Kirinmaru.

00:09:35.216 --> 00:09:37.822
‐ Would you please
do me the honor of a battle?

00:09:37.855 --> 00:09:39.626
‐ But am I the one you want?

00:09:39.659 --> 00:09:41.730
Isn't Towa
who you're really after?

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.634
‐ You've stricken me
right where it hurts!

00:09:47.174 --> 00:09:49.144
‐ Cyclone Burst!

00:09:51.182 --> 00:09:52.150
[gasps]

00:09:52.184 --> 00:09:53.921
Scourge of Swallows!

00:09:56.893 --> 00:09:57.895
‐ [scoffs]

00:10:01.102 --> 00:10:02.204
‐ Hmph.

00:10:02.237 --> 00:10:03.139
‐ [yelps]

00:10:05.143 --> 00:10:07.013
‐ [laughs]

00:10:08.249 --> 00:10:09.552
[gasps]

00:10:11.756 --> 00:10:12.892
‐ [snarl]
‐ [gasps]

00:10:12.925 --> 00:10:14.261
‐ Crimson Dragon Wave!

00:10:14.261 --> 00:10:15.998
[dragon roars]

00:10:17.735 --> 00:10:19.004
Have another!

00:10:25.851 --> 00:10:27.755
[laughs] Uh...

00:10:27.788 --> 00:10:30.628
‐ So you've come
to return the favor, have you?

00:10:30.694 --> 00:10:33.099
I like you,
Half‐Demon Princesses!

00:10:33.132 --> 00:10:34.869
<i>Azusa no Yumihari!</i>

00:10:34.903 --> 00:10:36.105
‐ [laughs]

00:10:36.172 --> 00:10:38.710
I already know
how your attack works.

00:10:38.744 --> 00:10:40.280
Nothing can save you now!

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.716
You're going down!

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.054
‐ [scoffs]
Didn't I teach you last time

00:10:44.087 --> 00:10:46.893
how your Crimson Dragon
doesn't work on me?

00:10:46.927 --> 00:10:49.131
Crimson Dragons
favor white clouds!

00:10:49.131 --> 00:10:50.133
‐ [dragon roars]
‐ I know,

00:10:50.133 --> 00:10:51.903
which is why...

00:10:51.937 --> 00:10:54.909
I borrowed this fancy umbrella
from Towa!

00:10:54.943 --> 00:10:55.978
‐ Well, then...

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.917
‐ [laughs]

00:10:58.951 --> 00:11:00.988
Now this is what
I was really waiting for!

00:11:03.159 --> 00:11:06.465
‐ Crimson Backlash Wave!
‐ [dragon roars]

00:11:06.498 --> 00:11:07.635
‐ Impossible.

00:11:14.047 --> 00:11:17.989
‐ [animal howls]
‐ [gasps]

00:11:17.989 --> 00:11:18.924
Eh?

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:23.667
What the hell was that?

00:11:23.734 --> 00:11:25.236
‐ That could only
have been one thing,

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:26.740
the Master's ashes.

00:11:26.773 --> 00:11:28.409
‐ When'd you get here,
Grandpa Myoga?

00:11:28.442 --> 00:11:30.113
‐ What are you talking about?

00:11:30.146 --> 00:11:31.415
Why, I never left.

00:11:31.448 --> 00:11:34.187
I haven't abandoned
your side once, Lady Moroha!

00:11:34.254 --> 00:11:36.025
‐ Uh‐huh. Whatever.

00:11:36.025 --> 00:11:37.762
Wait a sec.
When you say, "Master,"

00:11:37.795 --> 00:11:40.033
are you talking about Grandpa,
the Great Dog‐Demon?

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:41.803
‐ That's right.
This is the place

00:11:41.836 --> 00:11:43.840
where the Master
met his untimely end,

00:11:43.907 --> 00:11:45.109
so it wouldn't surprise me

00:11:45.143 --> 00:11:47.113
if Master's essence
seeped into the dirt

00:11:47.147 --> 00:11:49.919
and imbued the land
with his demon powers.

00:11:49.953 --> 00:11:51.455
‐ Oh.

00:11:51.488 --> 00:11:53.326
‐ Lady Moroha, the Backlash Wave

00:11:53.359 --> 00:11:55.463
was originally
Tessaiga's technique.

00:11:55.496 --> 00:11:57.935
It was something
your grandfather developed.

00:11:57.969 --> 00:11:59.973
With that in mind,
it only makes sense

00:12:00.006 --> 00:12:02.110
that the Master's ashes
could easily be used

00:12:02.143 --> 00:12:04.448
to cancel out the reversed flow
of demon energy.

00:12:04.481 --> 00:12:06.953
‐ Then what the hell
am I supposed to do?

00:12:06.987 --> 00:12:08.222
Ah, forget it!

00:12:08.289 --> 00:12:10.861
Sometimes you just
gotta roll with the punches!

00:12:17.207 --> 00:12:18.476
‐ It would appear...

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.480
that we've been surrounded.

00:12:20.514 --> 00:12:23.720
‐ At the very least,
you should be able to get away.

00:12:23.787 --> 00:12:25.891
‐ I would never do
such a heartless thing, Madam.

00:12:25.891 --> 00:12:26.893
I'll stay by you.

00:12:26.893 --> 00:12:28.897
‐ Did you say, "Madam"? Wait.

00:12:28.964 --> 00:12:31.803
You mean to tell me that Zero's
the one who looked after you?

00:12:31.836 --> 00:12:33.372
‐ Yes, the one and only.

00:12:33.406 --> 00:12:34.542
‐ [gasps]

00:12:34.575 --> 00:12:36.045
‐ You were right, Setsuna.

00:12:36.078 --> 00:12:38.249
Handing over the Silver Pearl
was a bad idea.

00:12:38.316 --> 00:12:40.754
‐ If that's the case,
we can probably assume

00:12:40.821 --> 00:12:42.424
that you're both in league
with Kirinmaru.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:45.430
‐ Well, I can neither
confirm nor deny that.

00:12:45.496 --> 00:12:48.336
‐ Lady Moroha,
You can't just go have a battle

00:12:48.369 --> 00:12:51.041
where Master passed away.
It's out of the question!

00:12:51.075 --> 00:12:53.412
I strongly advise you
to withdraw!

00:12:53.479 --> 00:12:54.916
‐ Look, I totally get

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:57.220
why you don't want us
to fight where our grandpa died,

00:12:57.253 --> 00:12:59.391
‐ but here's the thing...
‐ What is it?

00:12:59.424 --> 00:13:02.263
‐ I don't give a crap
about any of that right now!

00:13:02.263 --> 00:13:04.434
We're not backing down
from a fight we could win!

00:13:04.434 --> 00:13:06.372
‐ Of all the‐‐
You have some nerve,

00:13:06.405 --> 00:13:08.376
being so disrespectful
to your grandfather!

00:13:08.409 --> 00:13:10.279
Why do I even bother?

00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:11.448
‐ And off he goes.

00:13:11.516 --> 00:13:14.121
‐ Return the Silver Pearl
you took from Towa,

00:13:14.121 --> 00:13:16.225
or we will be forced
to take it from you.

00:13:16.258 --> 00:13:18.797
‐ [chuckles]
Go and do as she says, Riku.

00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:19.966
‐ Are you serious?

00:13:20.033 --> 00:13:21.536
You must be joking, Madam.

00:13:21.569 --> 00:13:23.272
I went through so much trouble

00:13:23.272 --> 00:13:25.376
to finally gather
all the Rainbow Pearls here.

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:26.378
‐ What?

00:13:26.412 --> 00:13:27.948
‐ [chuckles]

00:13:28.015 --> 00:13:30.253
‐ [gasps]

00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:40.941
‐ You've managed to gather
all of the Pearls?

00:13:40.974 --> 00:13:42.912
The Silver Pearl
isn't the only one

00:13:42.945 --> 00:13:44.247
you took into your possession?

00:13:44.247 --> 00:13:47.922
‐ Correct. I have five of them
here on me right now.

00:13:47.955 --> 00:13:49.091
That's not including

00:13:49.091 --> 00:13:50.661
the Gold Pearl
in Setsuna's right eye

00:13:50.728 --> 00:13:53.600
and the Red Pearl
that lies in Moroha's rouge.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.470
‐ How humiliating.

00:13:55.504 --> 00:13:58.910
For my tears to return to me
on such hallowed ground

00:13:58.944 --> 00:14:02.083
at the very place where
the Great Dog‐Demon met his end.

00:14:02.083 --> 00:14:04.956
Fate has a way
of playing cruel tricks.

00:14:04.989 --> 00:14:08.162
‐ Sorry, Madam. I was
meaning to hand them to you

00:14:08.229 --> 00:14:09.665
once I had them all, but...

00:14:09.732 --> 00:14:11.936
‐ Riku, you fool!
‐ [gasps]

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:13.305
‐ How dare you?

00:14:13.339 --> 00:14:16.345
How dare you bring those Pearls
anywhere near me?

00:14:16.412 --> 00:14:18.950
You want to return
those Pearls, do you?

00:14:18.984 --> 00:14:21.656
Then I will show you the power
of their rightful owner!

00:14:21.689 --> 00:14:23.627
‐ [gasping]

00:14:25.129 --> 00:14:26.365
‐ [gasps]

00:14:26.432 --> 00:14:27.467
[heart beats]

00:14:34.414 --> 00:14:37.153
‐ [winces]

00:14:37.187 --> 00:14:38.957
‐ Setsuna!

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:41.161
<i>As soon as the Gold Pearl</i>
<i>flew out of her eye,</i>

00:14:41.195 --> 00:14:43.032
<i>the Blood Blade</i>
<i>started acting up!</i>

00:14:45.169 --> 00:14:47.207
‐ No one makes me their fool!

00:14:47.273 --> 00:14:48.643
‐ [yelps]

00:14:48.643 --> 00:14:50.547
SETSUNA: That's enough!

00:14:51.649 --> 00:14:53.385
[yells]

00:15:03.205 --> 00:15:05.143
[pinwheel clacking]

00:15:12.023 --> 00:15:14.562
‐ Lord Sesshomaru,
the pinwheel just now,

00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:15.664
could it be...

00:15:15.697 --> 00:15:17.668
‐ There's no mistaking it.

00:15:17.668 --> 00:15:19.371
That's definitely Akuru.

00:15:20.707 --> 00:15:21.676
‐ Uh...

00:15:21.709 --> 00:15:24.347
w‐will you not give chase?

00:15:26.653 --> 00:15:28.757
Lord Sesshomaru, wait!

00:15:28.824 --> 00:15:30.694
‐ [wood creaking]

00:15:32.865 --> 00:15:34.367
[heavy clunk]

00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:36.305
[waves lapping]

00:15:39.712 --> 00:15:42.685
‐ The Windmill of Time
has turned.

00:15:42.685 --> 00:15:44.589
[tranquil music playing]

00:15:48.429 --> 00:15:49.532
‐ RIKU: Madam.
‐ [ragged breathing]

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:50.601
‐ Madam!

00:15:50.667 --> 00:15:53.205
No, you can't die, Madam!
Please!

00:15:53.239 --> 00:15:55.209
‐ [gasps]

00:15:56.746 --> 00:15:58.048
‐ [gasps] Rin?

00:15:58.082 --> 00:15:59.017
‐ [gasps]

00:16:01.088 --> 00:16:03.125
Zero must be dying.

00:16:03.192 --> 00:16:04.695
Who's responsible for this?

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:15.751
‐ So this is it, the Underworld.

00:16:15.784 --> 00:16:18.055
I see.

00:16:19.559 --> 00:16:20.761
‐ Oh, Zero.

00:16:20.794 --> 00:16:23.767
Were you planning to pass
without even a greeting?

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.773
But I suppose we were
never really that close.

00:16:26.806 --> 00:16:29.244
So age
has finally gotten to you?

00:16:29.277 --> 00:16:30.581
How very auspicious.

00:16:30.614 --> 00:16:33.385
‐ Actually,
it was Sesshomaru's daughter

00:16:33.419 --> 00:16:34.589
who cut my life short.

00:16:34.622 --> 00:16:36.258
‐ [laughs]

00:16:36.258 --> 00:16:37.595
Oh, that is hilarious.

00:16:37.628 --> 00:16:40.266
‐ Do you consider my death
to be but a joke?

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:43.773
‐ Your fruitless efforts got you
so wound up over those girls.

00:16:43.807 --> 00:16:46.245
That's what you get
for your needless meddling.

00:16:46.278 --> 00:16:48.750
‐ You may be right
on that account.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:52.257
Regardless,
I'm feeling much better now.

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:53.627
And do you know why?

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.263
Because I have succeeded

00:16:55.296 --> 00:16:58.102
in making Sesshomaru
feel downright miserable.

00:16:58.135 --> 00:16:59.739
‐ Is that so?

00:16:59.772 --> 00:17:03.479
‐ Remember the human woman that
Sesshomaru took as his wife?

00:17:03.513 --> 00:17:06.485
Well, I placed
a severance spell on her

00:17:06.519 --> 00:17:09.592
so if my life were to end,
then hers would end as well.

00:17:09.625 --> 00:17:11.161
‐ [scoffs]

00:17:11.194 --> 00:17:13.332
‐ I couldn't ask
for a better parting gift.

00:17:13.365 --> 00:17:15.136
I'm certain it won't be long

00:17:15.169 --> 00:17:17.240
before she passes
this way herself.

00:17:20.179 --> 00:17:22.618
Tell me, When Izayoi
passed through here

00:17:22.651 --> 00:17:25.791
all those years ago,
how did you feel, hmm?

00:17:26.926 --> 00:17:28.195
Let me guess.

00:17:28.262 --> 00:17:30.466
You had the same sense
of satisfaction

00:17:30.466 --> 00:17:31.636
that I'm feeling now.

00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:34.875
<i>Didn't your heart just dance?</i>

00:17:34.942 --> 00:17:36.178
‐ [sighs]

00:17:36.211 --> 00:17:38.850
<i>‐ Izayoi led him</i>
<i>to his death, after all.</i>

00:17:38.883 --> 00:17:40.954
<i>You couldn't help</i>
<i>but feel disdain.</i>

00:17:40.988 --> 00:17:42.357
‐ Such vulgarity.

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:45.396
‐ That's not
the answer I was hoping for.

00:17:45.463 --> 00:17:46.633
In my final moments,

00:17:46.666 --> 00:17:49.772
could you at the very least
show me some candor?

00:17:49.805 --> 00:17:51.308
Consider it an offering

00:17:51.341 --> 00:17:54.281
to the woman who wasn't chosen
by the Great Dog‐Demon.

00:17:56.385 --> 00:17:58.823
I haven't
the faintest interest in humans,

00:17:58.857 --> 00:18:01.228
and that's the last
I care to say about that

00:18:01.295 --> 00:18:02.397
to the likes of you.

00:18:02.463 --> 00:18:04.467
‐ Is that so?

00:18:06.405 --> 00:18:08.810
‐ There is nothing else
I can offer you.

00:18:08.843 --> 00:18:11.582
But, Zero, what was it
that you hoped to accomplish?

00:18:11.649 --> 00:18:14.555
‐ I simply wanted
to protect Kirinmaru

00:18:14.588 --> 00:18:16.659
from humans and half‐demons.

00:18:16.693 --> 00:18:17.895
‐ [laughs]

00:18:17.928 --> 00:18:20.867
Weren't you the one
telling me to show some candor?

00:18:20.867 --> 00:18:24.542
‐ Always talking down as if you
can see through everything.

00:18:24.575 --> 00:18:26.512
I never liked that about you.

00:18:26.512 --> 00:18:29.652
<i>‐ I shall take that</i>
<i>as the highest compliment.</i>

00:18:29.685 --> 00:18:32.691
‐ I hate humans and half‐demons,
that's all.

00:18:32.691 --> 00:18:35.764
Especially those half‐breed pups
who have done nothing more

00:18:35.831 --> 00:18:38.235
than inherit
the Great Dog‐Demon's blood.

00:18:38.268 --> 00:18:40.507
‐ Ah, so it was jealousy.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.945
How incredibly
and utterly human of you.

00:18:43.012 --> 00:18:44.548
‐ Did you say, "Human"?

00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:45.550
[sputters]

00:18:45.584 --> 00:18:46.953
You dare call me that?!

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.690
‐ Madam, no!

00:18:48.723 --> 00:18:50.560
‐ [gasping]

00:18:54.034 --> 00:18:55.504
‐ [both gasp]
‐ [gasps]

00:19:01.048 --> 00:19:02.450
‐ Hey, is that...

00:19:02.518 --> 00:19:03.720
‐ Sesshomaru.

00:19:06.058 --> 00:19:09.598
‐ Tell me. Why didn't you use
your own blade on Zero?

00:19:09.632 --> 00:19:12.738
‐ But this is
what I used to cut her with.

00:19:12.771 --> 00:19:14.909
Are you saying
this isn't my own blade?

00:19:14.942 --> 00:19:17.413
[tense music playing]

00:19:29.471 --> 00:19:31.709
[creatures growling]

00:19:32.945 --> 00:19:35.550
‐ Nothing about me
is remotely like a human!

00:19:35.584 --> 00:19:37.621
‐ Oh, how pitiful.

00:19:37.654 --> 00:19:40.794
Look where your desire for love
has led you.

00:19:40.827 --> 00:19:42.731
‐ [grunts]
‐ [creatures scream]

00:19:42.765 --> 00:19:44.568
‐ Did he cut something
just now?

00:19:49.645 --> 00:19:50.947
‐ [gasps]

00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:52.651
‐ She came back to life?

00:19:56.626 --> 00:19:59.532
‐ That one was
too close for comfort, Rin.

00:19:59.598 --> 00:20:02.336
‐ Impossible! I killed her.
How is she alive?!

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.640
‐ It's the Tenseiga!

00:20:03.673 --> 00:20:05.443
I've only
heard rumors about it.

00:20:05.443 --> 00:20:06.779
‐ The Tenseiga?

00:20:06.813 --> 00:20:09.017
‐ I don't exactly
know the details,

00:20:09.084 --> 00:20:13.492
but Sesshomaru's Tenseiga
is said to be a healing sword,

00:20:13.526 --> 00:20:15.797
one that can save
the lives of the weak.

00:20:15.831 --> 00:20:18.469
‐ So that's how Zero
was brought back from the dead.

00:20:18.503 --> 00:20:20.005
ZERO: Curses! It was you!

00:20:20.039 --> 00:20:21.943
Sesshomaru!

00:20:21.976 --> 00:20:23.546
No! Don't you dare tell me

00:20:23.613 --> 00:20:25.517
you used the Tenseiga
to bring me back to life.

00:20:27.654 --> 00:20:30.994
Sesshomaru, I will
never forgive you for this.

00:20:30.994 --> 00:20:33.733
Reviving me using his fang,
of all things!

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.704
How could you do
something so abhorrent?!

00:20:35.737 --> 00:20:37.473
Just knowing is sheer torture!

00:20:37.473 --> 00:20:40.446
‐ I could not think
of another way.

00:20:40.479 --> 00:20:41.983
‐ [shuddering]

00:20:41.983 --> 00:20:43.820
‐ Please, Madam, calm yourself.

00:20:43.853 --> 00:20:45.957
[energy surges]

00:20:45.991 --> 00:20:47.861
[dramatic music playing]

00:20:47.895 --> 00:20:49.965
TOWA:
<i>Living in this world is hard.</i>

00:20:49.999 --> 00:20:52.538
<i>If you don't live by the rules,</i>

00:20:52.571 --> 00:20:54.809
<i>you end up</i>
<i>getting treated as an outcast.</i>

00:20:55.877 --> 00:20:57.346
<i>I got so sick and tired</i>

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:00.052
<i>of everyone else's ideals</i>
<i>in the other world.</i>

00:21:00.085 --> 00:21:02.056
‐ You ruined everything!

00:21:02.089 --> 00:21:05.897
<i>‐ Zero's probably going through</i>
<i>the same emotions now</i>

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:07.768
<i>that I was going through</i>
<i>back then.</i>

00:21:07.835 --> 00:21:09.672
‐ I'll make you pay
for what you did!

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.684
‐ Tenseiga.

00:21:15.717 --> 00:21:18.355
‐ What a fool I was
to lose sight of myself.

00:21:18.388 --> 00:21:21.896
Until now, my intention
was to allow Kirinmaru

00:21:21.929 --> 00:21:25.002
the pleasure of disposing
of your daughters.

00:21:25.035 --> 00:21:27.708
But now that you've brought me
to my breaking point,

00:21:27.708 --> 00:21:28.943
I've changed my mind.

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.716
I'll deal with your irritating
little whelps myself!

00:21:31.716 --> 00:21:33.553
I will falter no more!

00:21:33.553 --> 00:21:36.692
Nothing will stop me
from being who I am.

00:21:36.726 --> 00:21:39.030
Riku, bring me
the Rainbow Pearls

00:21:39.063 --> 00:21:41.602
so I may subjugate them
with my demon powers.

00:21:41.636 --> 00:21:43.506
‐ Wait, Madam!
Please, I beg you!

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:45.376
[all gasp]

00:21:54.528 --> 00:21:55.764
‐ Kirinmaru?

00:21:58.536 --> 00:22:00.574
‐ Should have known
he'd show up at some point.

00:22:00.574 --> 00:22:02.043
‐ [chuckles] Well, that explains

00:22:02.076 --> 00:22:04.882
why Grandpa Myoga
decided to make a run for it.

00:22:04.915 --> 00:22:05.784
‐ [growls]

00:22:12.463 --> 00:22:14.400
[Japanese music playing]

00:23:42.009 --> 00:23:43.880
[rain pattering]

00:23:49.324 --> 00:23:51.094
[no audible dialogue]
