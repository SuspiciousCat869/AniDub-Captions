JYUBEI: Lord Riku,
I'd like to return this to you.

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:42.652
‐ You're done with it?

00:00:42.686 --> 00:00:44.455
‐ Yes. That Rainbow Pearl

00:00:44.488 --> 00:00:46.359
has really helped attract
more bounties,

00:00:46.426 --> 00:00:48.698
netting me
some pretty big profits.

00:00:48.698 --> 00:00:49.766
‐ Is that so?

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.770
‐ I'm glad to hear it.
‐ [chime rings]

‐ [yelps]

00:01:33.186 --> 00:01:35.424
Oh, my goodness.
Please excuse me.

00:01:36.593 --> 00:01:37.696
[sighs]

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.503
Sir Konton,
taking your time, I see.

00:01:41.537 --> 00:01:42.572
‐ What do you mean?

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:45.177
‐ Those princesses
keep on thwarting you

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.649
while you stay
tucked away in the back.

00:01:47.682 --> 00:01:49.085
Are you satisfied with that?

00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:50.888
‐ [chuckles]

00:01:50.922 --> 00:01:53.761
You're likely unaware
of what this is here,

00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:56.099
but I am preparing a field.

00:01:56.165 --> 00:01:57.702
‐ A field?

00:01:57.736 --> 00:01:59.906
‐ An eight‐field escape trap.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.244
It's based on Fang magic.

00:02:02.277 --> 00:02:05.283
But I can't decide
on the keystone,

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.756
an affixed
focal point of power.

00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.695
Want to volunteer?

00:02:10.728 --> 00:02:13.634
‐ Oh, no, I'm not strong enough
to take on such a task.

00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:16.607
Maybe it'd be best if you
played the role yourself.

00:02:16.607 --> 00:02:19.345
I need to be outside it,
controlling the field.

00:02:19.378 --> 00:02:22.284
‐ Well, then,
how about Mr. Totetsu?

00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:24.221
‐ You mean that glutton?

00:02:24.255 --> 00:02:27.294
[chuckles]
Surely you must be joking.

00:02:27.294 --> 00:02:30.434
‐ Of Lord Kirinmaru's
Four Perils,

00:02:30.467 --> 00:02:33.574
only you and
Mr. Totetsu remain.

00:02:33.607 --> 00:02:36.446
Why not work together for once?

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:39.485
‐ I don't know where he is
or what he's doing.

00:02:39.553 --> 00:02:42.291
‐ Oh, you can leave
that matter in my hands.

00:02:42.324 --> 00:02:43.928
I'll pursue and bring him here.

00:02:43.961 --> 00:02:47.569
‐ If you wish to be useful,
bring the girls, too.

00:02:47.602 --> 00:02:48.738
If they're not lured in,

00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:51.409
then this field
is practically useless.

00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:54.148
‐ I understand. In that case,
then I'll make sure

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:56.319
to arrange for that
to occur as well.

00:02:56.386 --> 00:02:58.824
‐ How very generous of you.

00:02:58.891 --> 00:03:02.297
‐ Stealing the Pearls
from the Half‐Demon Princesses

00:03:02.331 --> 00:03:04.335
is the wish of Lord Kirinmaru.

00:03:04.402 --> 00:03:07.642
I sure hope
you have not forgotten that.

00:03:07.675 --> 00:03:09.579
‐ Of course I haven't.

00:03:11.482 --> 00:03:14.856
Totetsu as the keystone...

I swear someone
over at the nearby village

00:05:06.947 --> 00:05:08.449
said that it was!

00:05:08.517 --> 00:05:10.621
‐ No, this here
is Mount Omusubi.

00:05:10.688 --> 00:05:11.723
‐ Omusubi?

00:05:11.757 --> 00:05:13.527
‐ Yes. Just take a look there.

00:05:13.561 --> 00:05:17.301
Doesn't it remind you
of the food by the same name?

00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:18.537
‐ Uh...

00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:21.042
So where's Mount Musubi then?

00:05:21.075 --> 00:05:23.647
‐ Never heard of a mountain
with that name.

00:05:23.647 --> 00:05:25.450
‐ [moans]

00:05:25.483 --> 00:05:26.653

‐ [meows]
‐ [Setsuna sighs]

00:05:29.793 --> 00:05:32.331
Well, that was a big mix‐up,
wasn't it?

00:05:32.397 --> 00:05:33.901
‐ Come on. This is serious.

00:05:33.934 --> 00:05:35.605
If we don't catch
the Dream Butterfly,

00:05:35.638 --> 00:05:38.443
we'll never be able to get
your ability to sleep back.

00:05:38.476 --> 00:05:40.882
‐ I've told you before,
I'm fine without it.

00:05:41.984 --> 00:05:43.587
Let's start heading back.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.094
‐ Still no closer.

00:05:47.127 --> 00:05:49.666
Where the heck
is that butterfly?

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:00.588
you still refuse
to lift a finger?

00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:01.590
‐ Hmm?

00:06:01.623 --> 00:06:02.792
‐ You were supposed to see

00:06:02.825 --> 00:06:05.463
that Sesshomaru's daughters
were done away with.

00:06:05.497 --> 00:06:07.467
‐ Is that the case now?

00:06:07.502 --> 00:06:08.504
‐ Yes, it is.

00:06:09.606 --> 00:06:11.977
‐ Riku seems to be on the move.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.683
‐ You're leaving things to him?

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:16.787
‐ He is
my most trusted retainer.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.489
It will be fine.

00:06:18.524 --> 00:06:20.327

I'm pretty sure
you missed a spot right there.

‐ [growls] Little pipsqueak.

00:06:43.172 --> 00:06:45.477
Hey, Mr. Jyubei,
can you just give me

00:06:45.511 --> 00:06:47.682
another bounty hunting job
to do instead?

00:06:47.715 --> 00:06:49.051
‐ I don't have any right now.

00:06:49.051 --> 00:06:50.855
‐ Less talky, more worky.

00:06:50.888 --> 00:06:52.692
You wanna make sure
you earn enough cash

00:06:52.725 --> 00:06:54.061
for today's meal, don't you?

00:06:54.061 --> 00:06:57.635
‐ I can't believe you guys
are just having me clean stuff.

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:00.675
I've made you all so much money
from bringing back bounties!

00:07:00.708 --> 00:07:03.179
‐ I still think that you
just got lucky with those.

00:07:03.212 --> 00:07:05.083
‐ Shut your trap,
you raccoon dog.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.087
‐ You wanna say that again,
quarter‐demon?

00:07:07.087 --> 00:07:08.489
‐ RIKU: Excuse me.
‐ ALL: Hmm?

00:07:08.524 --> 00:07:10.493
‐ We celebrating in here?

00:07:10.528 --> 00:07:11.730
‐ Lord Riku.

00:07:11.763 --> 00:07:14.101
What sort of business
do you have with us today?

00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:15.905
‐ Thing is‐‐

00:07:15.905 --> 00:07:17.474
Oh, you're here,

00:07:17.508 --> 00:07:19.879
the bounty hunter
I was looking for.

00:07:19.913 --> 00:07:21.583
‐ Huh? you mean me?

00:07:21.583 --> 00:07:24.488
‐ How is the slaying
of the Four Perils going?

00:07:24.522 --> 00:07:27.762
If I remember correctly,
I left quite a tidy sum for it.

00:07:27.829 --> 00:07:29.566
‐ Believe me,
if it were my choice,

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:30.935
I would have
hunted them both down

00:07:31.002 --> 00:07:32.705
and killed the bastards already.

00:07:32.739 --> 00:07:34.108
‐ And then, bam...
‐ [Takechiyo moaning]

00:07:34.174 --> 00:07:37.114
‐ my debts would be all paid off
and my life would be great,

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.753
but I have no idea
where either of them ran off to.

00:07:39.786 --> 00:07:43.226
‐ Oh, my. I thought
that might be the case.

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:46.867
Truth is, I heard
a rumor regarding Totetsu.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.704
‐ [moaning]
‐ Totetsu? Don't tell me

00:07:48.737 --> 00:07:50.508
he's going around,
eating monks again.

00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:54.048
‐ Exactly right. I heard that
someone spotted him recently.

00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:57.220
‐ [giggles] If you know where
he is, leave the rest to me.

00:07:57.254 --> 00:07:59.458
‐ And where are
the other two princesses?

00:07:59.526 --> 00:08:00.695
‐ The village, I think.

00:08:00.728 --> 00:08:02.030
Let's go, Takechiyo.

00:08:02.064 --> 00:08:05.571
‐ Huh? Why do I have to go along
on your wild‐goose chase?

00:08:05.604 --> 00:08:06.773
‐ Just go do it.

00:08:06.807 --> 00:08:08.142
‐ [groans]

She hasn't
shown herself in a while,

the Tree of Ages.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.218
I wonder if she gave up
on trying to get us

00:08:29.251 --> 00:08:32.157
to kill that guy.
Kirinmaru, right?

00:08:32.157 --> 00:08:34.562
Or maybe, since we've been

00:08:34.596 --> 00:08:36.967
gradually defeating
his underlings anyway,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.506
she's just keeping tabs
on what's going on.

00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:41.977
Instead of Kirinmaru,

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.181
I'd rather hunt down
something else.

00:08:45.584 --> 00:08:46.987

MOROHA: There they are!

00:08:57.107 --> 00:08:58.844
‐ Hey!
‐ Eh?

00:09:01.182 --> 00:09:03.186
Takechiyo's with her, too?

00:09:03.252 --> 00:09:04.923
Huh? Wait.

00:09:04.956 --> 00:09:06.827
And Riku?

00:09:08.964 --> 00:09:11.168
‐ We know
where Totetsu ran off to!

00:09:11.202 --> 00:09:12.638
Let's go kick his butt.

00:09:12.672 --> 00:09:14.341
‐ How were you able
to track him down?

00:09:14.374 --> 00:09:16.646
‐ I know some trusty pirates.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.216
They gave me the information.

00:09:18.282 --> 00:09:20.721
MOROHA: Come on. Let's go!

00:09:20.788 --> 00:09:22.190
TOWA: Are you OK with this?

00:09:22.224 --> 00:09:23.894
MOROHA: What do you mean?

00:09:23.961 --> 00:09:27.568
‐ The Tree of Ages,
she wanted us to kill Kirinmaru,

00:09:27.635 --> 00:09:29.271
and this'll bring us
one step closer.

00:09:29.304 --> 00:09:31.877
‐ As long as I can make money,
I don't really care.

00:09:31.877 --> 00:09:33.614
‐ I'd honestly rather go looking

00:09:33.647 --> 00:09:35.951
for the Dream Butterfly
instead of him.

00:09:35.985 --> 00:09:37.555
‐ RIKU: That reminds me...
‐ Eh?

00:09:37.622 --> 00:09:41.730
Lady Towa, in regards
to that same Dream Butterfly,

00:09:41.797 --> 00:09:45.170
so happens I was also told
by the very same source

00:09:45.203 --> 00:09:47.575
that Kirinmaru
and the Dream Butterfly

00:09:47.642 --> 00:09:49.712
are inexplicably
connected somehow.

00:09:49.746 --> 00:09:50.981
‐ Is that true?

00:09:51.015 --> 00:09:54.388
‐ Well, it's only a rumor
for the time being.

00:09:54.421 --> 00:09:57.194
‐ So do you know
where Kirinmaru is?

00:09:57.227 --> 00:10:00.166
‐ Unfortunately
I can't say I do.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.039
Even so, if you keep
defeating his underlings,

00:10:03.072 --> 00:10:05.343
I think he will show himself
in due time.

00:10:05.376 --> 00:10:08.249
‐ I see. Well, then,
what are we waiting for?

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:11.255
‐ Yeah! I can't wait
to cash in on this one!

00:10:11.322 --> 00:10:12.758
‐ Setsuna!

00:10:29.091 --> 00:10:30.126
‐ Let's go.

00:10:34.969 --> 00:10:37.909
‐ If my sources
about Totetsu are correct,

00:10:37.942 --> 00:10:40.213
he should be located due east
near the river.

00:10:40.246 --> 00:10:42.718
‐ Hurry up, Takechiyo!

00:10:42.752 --> 00:10:46.125
‐ [groans] I've never had
to carry so many people before.

00:10:46.192 --> 00:10:49.431
TOWA: So, Riku, why are you
interested in Kirinmaru?

00:10:49.464 --> 00:10:52.037
‐ Ah. Well,
it seems he possesses

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:53.941
something which I desire.

00:10:53.974 --> 00:10:55.310
TOWA: A Rainbow Pearl?

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.147
‐ Something much more valuable.

00:10:57.147 --> 00:10:59.986
‐ Like what?
Some kinda rare treasure?

00:11:00.053 --> 00:11:03.159
‐ Now, now.
I would hate to do a disservice

00:11:03.159 --> 00:11:05.129
and go spoiling the surprise.

00:11:08.369 --> 00:11:10.808
[men screaming]

00:11:12.812 --> 00:11:13.981
‐ What's happening?

00:11:14.047 --> 00:11:15.450
‐ I'm pretty sure
a virtuous monk

00:11:15.483 --> 00:11:17.220
lives down in that temple
right there.

00:11:17.254 --> 00:11:20.460
‐ I wonder,
Has Totetsu shown himself?

00:11:20.493 --> 00:11:22.330
‐ Do you think he's here
to eat the monk?

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:23.901
MOROHA: Hurry, Takechiyo.

00:11:23.934 --> 00:11:25.336
‐ [groans]

00:11:25.336 --> 00:11:26.940
[monk panting]

00:11:26.973 --> 00:11:27.942
‐ Gotcha!

00:11:27.975 --> 00:11:29.344
‐ [wails]

00:11:29.411 --> 00:11:31.750
‐ [chuckles]

00:11:31.783 --> 00:11:35.256
Time to eat. Down the hatch!

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.460
‐ [growls]
‐ [whimpers]

00:11:37.494 --> 00:11:41.937
‐ Damn. You actually
don't look all that tasty.

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:43.840
But I'm still gonna eat you!

00:11:43.907 --> 00:11:45.844
‐ Someone help me!

00:11:45.844 --> 00:11:48.015
‐ How long do I
have to keep this up?

00:11:48.082 --> 00:11:49.284
‐ Huh?

00:11:49.318 --> 00:11:52.257
‐ I don't even wanna look
at this dried‐up monk,

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.860
let alone eat him.

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.864
‐ TOWA: Stop it, Totetsu!
‐ Huh?

00:11:55.864 --> 00:11:57.868
‐ Put that monk down right now!

00:11:57.868 --> 00:11:59.438
‐ [laughs]

00:11:59.471 --> 00:12:03.112
You finally showed up,
you foul‐tasting half‐demons.

00:12:03.145 --> 00:12:04.816
You really are fools.

00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:06.151
‐ What?

00:12:06.185 --> 00:12:09.124
‐ Tell me, why do I have
to let go of this monk?

00:12:09.157 --> 00:12:11.195
‐ Uh, well,
'cause he's a hostage,

00:12:11.228 --> 00:12:12.464
which is wrong obviously,

00:12:12.497 --> 00:12:14.903
and so if you
don't let him go, I guess‐‐

00:12:14.903 --> 00:12:16.706
‐ Enough talk.
Let's just get rid of him.

00:12:16.773 --> 00:12:18.209
‐ Shouldn't we
help the monk first?

00:12:18.276 --> 00:12:19.846
‐ If he's caught
in the crossfire,

00:12:19.879 --> 00:12:21.850
it means fate
just wasn't on his side.

00:12:21.883 --> 00:12:23.185
‐ What?! [whimpers]

00:12:23.219 --> 00:12:25.223
‐ Come and get me then.

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:26.392
‐ Steel yourself.

00:12:26.458 --> 00:12:29.164
‐ Setsuna!
We can't just‐‐[gasps]

00:12:29.197 --> 00:12:30.534
‐ Please, help me!

[Totetsu chuckles]

00:13:29.284 --> 00:13:32.090
Come on, Takechiyo.
We're going after him!

00:13:32.123 --> 00:13:34.261
‐ You're working me too hard!

00:13:34.294 --> 00:13:36.398
‐ Setsuna, Towa, jump on!

00:13:37.467 --> 00:13:39.438
‐ 'Kay, hold on tight!

‐ [groans]

00:13:41.108 --> 00:13:43.613
I'm still alive somehow?

00:13:43.613 --> 00:13:45.617
‐ Catch me if you can!

00:13:45.651 --> 00:13:47.487
‐ You're not getting away!

00:14:14.776 --> 00:14:17.480
‐ [gasps] They‐‐
They disappeared!

TAKECHIYO: What's going on here?

00:14:47.508 --> 00:14:50.146
‐ Seems they've crossed
into a magic field.

00:14:50.179 --> 00:14:51.716
‐ So what happens now?

00:14:51.783 --> 00:14:55.123
‐ Unfortunately, even I
cannot say for certain.

00:14:55.156 --> 00:14:56.325
‐ Huh?!

00:14:56.358 --> 00:14:57.561
‐ The Rainbow Pearls

00:14:57.628 --> 00:14:59.732
shall determine the outcome,
I suppose.

‐ [wind gusts]
‐ [chuckles]

00:15:03.339 --> 00:15:05.009
‐ I thought we were in a ravine,

00:15:05.042 --> 00:15:06.311
but it's pretty wide.

00:15:06.345 --> 00:15:08.550
‐ No sign of Totetsu.

00:15:08.617 --> 00:15:10.286
‐ Same for Moroha.

00:15:11.355 --> 00:15:13.225
Let's rest under that tree.

00:15:15.163 --> 00:15:16.699
‐ Get your ass back here!

00:15:16.699 --> 00:15:18.235
[Totetsu panting]

and accept your fate!

‐ Crimson Dragon Wave!
‐ [dragon roars]

00:15:24.715 --> 00:15:26.385

00:15:27.688 --> 00:15:28.557
‐ Huh?

00:15:31.729 --> 00:15:33.567
He vanished into thin air.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.236
Was it just an illusion?

00:15:38.677 --> 00:15:39.712
[gasps]

00:15:41.583 --> 00:15:43.720

[echoing] Setsuna! Towa!

00:15:55.443 --> 00:15:56.779
‐ Something feels wrong.

00:15:56.846 --> 00:16:00.253
[echoing] We haven't
gotten any closer to it.

00:16:00.286 --> 00:16:03.627
‐ And still no sign
of Moroha or Totetsu.

00:16:03.693 --> 00:16:05.296
Moroha!

00:16:06.431 --> 00:16:07.735
You out there?!

00:16:09.437 --> 00:16:11.275
Moroha!

00:16:13.345 --> 00:16:14.549
‐ Let's continue.

00:16:22.531 --> 00:16:25.303
‐ [grunting]

00:16:27.473 --> 00:16:30.747
Just how deep
is this ravine, anyway?

00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:34.254
Seriously, it feels
like it goes on forever!

00:16:44.809 --> 00:16:46.713
[dramatic music playing]

00:17:00.473 --> 00:17:02.143
‐ Through the gate of opening,

00:17:02.176 --> 00:17:04.481
trapped in the gate
of surprise,

00:17:04.481 --> 00:17:08.455
and now those two
are at the gate of rest.

00:17:08.489 --> 00:17:10.493
‐ This is definitely strange.

00:17:10.527 --> 00:17:13.800
‐ Yeah, it is. We haven't
gotten any closer to it.

00:17:13.833 --> 00:17:15.303
You think we should head back?

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:18.810
Wait. Did we walk this far?

00:17:18.843 --> 00:17:21.315
‐ It's possible
we may have been captured

00:17:21.315 --> 00:17:23.285
in some kind of spell
of illusion.

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:24.522
‐ An illusion?

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:28.462
‐ Totetsu isn't the only one
we need to worry about.

00:17:28.495 --> 00:17:29.832
‐ That's right.

00:17:29.865 --> 00:17:33.172
Konton, he was always using
strange spells.

00:17:33.205 --> 00:17:35.711
‐ Towa, I want you
to cut me with your sword.

00:17:35.777 --> 00:17:37.982
‐ Uh, what?

00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:40.286
‐ I said that I
want you to cut me.

00:17:40.319 --> 00:17:43.526
‐ Why would I do that?
There's no way I could.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:44.494
‐ I see.

00:17:45.631 --> 00:17:46.532
‐ [gasps]

00:17:48.837 --> 00:17:51.308
‐ [groans]
‐ Setsuna?

00:17:51.341 --> 00:17:53.212
‐ [panting]

00:18:01.963 --> 00:18:04.502
I thought I'd wake up
if this was an illusion,

00:18:04.535 --> 00:18:06.873
but I guess that
would have been too easy.

00:18:06.873 --> 00:18:08.543
‐ That was reckless!

00:18:08.543 --> 00:18:10.514
‐ You're too soft.
‐ [gasps]

00:18:10.547 --> 00:18:12.317
‐ It's not
necessarily your fault

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:13.820
you lack sufficient training,

00:18:13.853 --> 00:18:16.425
but earlier today,
when fighting Totetsu,

00:18:16.491 --> 00:18:18.930
he was able to read
your facial expressions

00:18:18.997 --> 00:18:21.001
and figured out
Moroha was behind him.

00:18:21.034 --> 00:18:22.403
‐ [gasps] Did he, really?

00:18:22.437 --> 00:18:24.374
‐ Do not underestimate this era.

00:18:24.407 --> 00:18:26.211
‐ [gasps]

00:18:26.244 --> 00:18:27.246
[sighs]

00:18:28.382 --> 00:18:29.552
‐ So what next?

00:18:29.585 --> 00:18:32.591
If not an illusion,
what kind of spell is it?

00:18:32.658 --> 00:18:34.996
‐ Setsuna, wait here, OK?

00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:37.601
‐ What's your plan?
Are the two of us splitting up?

00:18:37.668 --> 00:18:40.674
‐ You'll be my guidepost,
so don't move from there!

00:18:40.707 --> 00:18:42.343
‐ [footsteps crunching]
‐ [sighs]

00:18:49.692 --> 00:18:52.564
[dramatic music playing]

‐ [grunting]

00:19:10.867 --> 00:19:11.936
How's that?!

00:19:11.969 --> 00:19:13.907
[panting]

00:19:16.579 --> 00:19:18.382
Huh?

00:19:18.415 --> 00:19:19.284
[wails]

00:19:20.721 --> 00:19:22.958
What the hell is going on?

00:19:22.991 --> 00:19:24.060
There's still more?

00:19:24.094 --> 00:19:25.797
‐ [rumbling]
‐ [gasps]

00:19:33.646 --> 00:19:36.284
‐ [growling]
‐ Ah, damn it.

00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:42.463
[grunts]

00:19:42.463 --> 00:19:44.401
[wind echoing]

00:19:46.471 --> 00:19:48.475
‐ The same tree?

00:19:49.578 --> 00:19:52.518
But wasn't it
behind me just now?

00:19:52.584 --> 00:19:54.522
Setsuna, you there?!

00:19:54.588 --> 00:19:55.657
[gasps]

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.596
[Konton laughs]

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:02.571
From the gate of surprise
on to the gate of death.

00:20:02.604 --> 00:20:04.007
‐ Calm down.

00:20:04.074 --> 00:20:05.844
You've got this, Towa.

00:20:11.088 --> 00:20:12.958
I smell Setsuna's blood.

00:20:14.461 --> 00:20:17.333
[wind echoing]

00:20:18.536 --> 00:20:19.939
TOWA: Setsuna!

00:20:19.972 --> 00:20:21.809
Can you hear me?!

00:20:21.843 --> 00:20:23.546
‐ Over here!
‐ [footsteps crunching]

00:20:23.613 --> 00:20:25.684
‐ Towa?
‐ Setsuna!

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:27.353
‐ Why are you over there?

00:20:27.386 --> 00:20:29.491
I haven't moved at all
from this spot.

00:20:29.525 --> 00:20:32.531
‐ It looks like Konton's spell
bends the space around us,

00:20:32.531 --> 00:20:35.771
and it's been making us
walk around in circles!

00:20:35.804 --> 00:20:37.140
‐ She vanished!

00:20:37.173 --> 00:20:38.676
‐ It's a M Ã¶bius strip!

00:20:38.676 --> 00:20:40.981
‐ A what?
‐ An infinite loop!

00:20:41.014 --> 00:20:42.985
If we aren't able
to escape it physically,

00:20:43.018 --> 00:20:46.358
we'll just have to go
and sever the circle itself!

00:20:46.391 --> 00:20:49.698
‐ Alright, but what exactly
should I be severing here?

00:20:49.732 --> 00:20:51.636
‐ It'd be a nexus of some kind,

00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:54.407
but I don't know
if we can see it.

a rift of demon energy.

to sniff out the location
of where demon energies clash

00:21:05.764 --> 00:21:07.534
and a technique
to cut through it.

00:21:07.568 --> 00:21:09.505
‐ Sniff it out, huh?

00:21:09.538 --> 00:21:10.874

00:22:04.949 --> 00:22:06.719
How dare you?

00:22:06.752 --> 00:22:08.957
Distasteful.

TOWA: He must be
scrambling for help

00:23:51.227 --> 00:23:53.065
from his superior, Kirinmaru.

00:23:53.098 --> 00:23:55.069
‐ MOROHA: Superior?
‐ TOWA: Someone above his rank.

00:23:55.102 --> 00:23:56.906
MOROHA: Then that'd be
the boss, wouldn't it?

00:23:56.973 --> 00:23:58.208
Hey, how much do you think

00:23:58.241 --> 00:24:00.346
a demon like Kirinmaru
is worth?!

00:24:00.379 --> 00:24:02.684
