of flow for her age.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.266
‐ Gotta say, I'm impressed.

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.133
‐ Her form's
not too shabby, either.

00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:18.066
‐ Being a fast learner comes
natural when you're so young.

00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.566
‐ You know, you keep going on
about how young I am,

00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:22.633
when actually,
now that I'm in this era,

00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:24.466
I'm way older than all of you!

‐ MOROHA: It's true, though.

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:31.266
Not only that.
I'm about 450 years older

00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.266
than every single one
of you guys.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.766
‐ Hah!
‐ [cheering]

00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:37.566
‐ Everyone's looking
so energetic today.

00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:39.233
‐ Morning there, Grandpa.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.166
‐ Looks like you've begun
to fit in quite well.

00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:44.100
‐ It makes sense.
It's been a few days.

00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:47.500
‐ Oh, really? In that case,
I have something for you.

00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.666
‐ Yeah? Nice!
What'd you get me?

00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:53.133
‐ That is an authentic
mummified foot of a kappa.

00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:55.133
It brings you good fortune.

00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.733
‐ This is the best gift ever!

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.666
‐ You know its value!

00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:02.640
Kagome gave birth
to a truly wonderful daughter.

00:01:02.673 --> 00:01:04.340
Thank you, Kagome,

00:01:04.406 --> 00:01:06.240
‐ wherever you are.
‐ Oh?

00:01:06.306 --> 00:01:07.840
‐ There is new meaning
to my life!

00:01:07.906 --> 00:01:09.339
MOROHA: Aha!

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.240
Seems like our little friend
finally noticed us.

<i>I've decided I'm going</i>

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.186
<i>If both Setsuna and Moroha</i>
<i>come from there,</i>

00:03:08.286 --> 00:03:11.186

00:03:14.153 --> 00:03:17.186

00:03:17.286 --> 00:03:19.786

stand up, please.

00:03:29.153 --> 00:03:30.086
‐ Oh, yes.

00:03:30.153 --> 00:03:31.786
Of course, Mr. Kirin.

00:03:31.853 --> 00:03:33.286
‐ Whatever's out that window

00:03:33.353 --> 00:03:35.486
won't save you
from my English class.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.686
Now please read from line 23.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.653

00:03:43.686 --> 00:03:45.286
<i>I'm pretty sure</i>
<i>learning English</i>

00:03:45.353 --> 00:03:47.853

There has to be a way
for us to lift the curse

00:04:09.593 --> 00:04:11.193
so she can
go back to having dreams!

00:04:11.293 --> 00:04:13.493
‐ Yeah, there is.
The answer's pretty obvious.

00:04:13.526 --> 00:04:16.193
We gotta capture
the Dream Butterfly.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
‐ So where do we find
this butterfly?

00:04:18.326 --> 00:04:20.460
‐ Don't know.
Except I'm positive

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:22.326
it's not in the world
we're in right now.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.193
‐ We must return
to our own timeline with haste.

00:04:25.293 --> 00:04:27.126
‐ Uh‐huh. First we go back,

00:04:27.193 --> 00:04:29.160
then find
and capture the Butterfly.

00:04:29.193 --> 00:04:31.460
‐ It's as easy as that!
‐ What do you mean "easy"?

00:04:31.526 --> 00:04:33.626
How do you plan on getting back
to the Feudal Era?

00:04:33.693 --> 00:04:34.793
‐ Oh, yeah.

00:04:34.859 --> 00:04:36.859
Well, no use
sweating the small stuff.

00:04:36.926 --> 00:04:39.193

will sort itself out.

‐ Bravo! [laughs]

00:04:50.793 --> 00:04:53.626
You've mastered the instrument
in such a short time.

00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:56.093
‐ It's thanks to the skill
of the teacher.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.526
‐ You're a prodigy that comes
once in a hundred years‐‐

00:04:58.626 --> 00:05:01.133
No, more like once in 500 years!

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.366
You know,
you can probably become

00:05:03.466 --> 00:05:05.500
a worldwide violinist like me.

00:05:05.533 --> 00:05:07.133
‐ Hey, Setsuna.
‐ Hmm?

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.633
Yes? What is it?

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.866
‐ Moroha wanted me
to come and get you.

00:05:10.933 --> 00:05:12.633
‐ Oh? What does she want?

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.433
‐ She said she found a way
for you guys to go back home.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.500

00:05:16.533 --> 00:05:19.200

Hey, Setsuna, guess what!

00:05:22.433 --> 00:05:24.266
Yours truly just found our way‐‐

00:05:24.333 --> 00:05:26.433
Hold on.
What's with the fancy get‐up.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.366
Ooh. Wow, Setsu.

00:05:28.433 --> 00:05:29.633
You're lookin'
pretty cute there.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.500
‐ I'll kill you.

00:05:31.533 --> 00:05:33.700
Anyway, you found
a means to get back?

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.533
‐ Yeah, you bet I did.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.366
Remember the first time we went
through the rainbow corridor

00:05:38.466 --> 00:05:40.700
and we felt our energy
being sapped away?

00:05:40.766 --> 00:05:43.200
A demon called Root Head
was the one stealing it.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.633
‐ The plant demon?

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.133
Turns out it got tangled

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.100
with the roots
from the Tree of Ages,

00:05:48.166 --> 00:05:50.433
and it created
a time‐traveling corridor.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.833
‐ Oh? You did your research.

00:05:52.866 --> 00:05:54.666
‐ Nah, I don't do
stuff like that.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.200
I just asked it myself.
[giggles]

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.333
The root was sitting there,
looking pretty bored,

00:05:59.366 --> 00:06:02.506
so I asked it a question or two,
and then it wouldn't shut up.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.440
Anyway, whenever we wanna
get back to the other world,

00:06:05.506 --> 00:06:08.306
we can get there by negotiating
with dusty old Root Head.

00:06:08.373 --> 00:06:11.473
‐ I see. It's worth a shot.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.306
But what's the bag for?

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.106
‐ I'm glad you asked!

00:06:15.173 --> 00:06:16.540
It's just a few little things

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.473
I thought would be useful
for when we get back home!

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.206
Uh, whoops.

00:06:21.306 --> 00:06:22.840
Wait. What's this?

00:06:22.873 --> 00:06:24.206
Aw, it doesn't matter.

00:06:24.306 --> 00:06:26.106
Into the bag, it goes!

00:06:26.173 --> 00:06:27.640
Oh, and you gotta
check this out!

00:06:27.706 --> 00:06:28.640
‐ Feast your eyes!
‐ [gasps]

00:06:28.706 --> 00:06:29.806
This is the bounty

00:06:29.873 --> 00:06:31.540
that's gonna buy me
a nice lunch.

‐ [groans]
‐ Let's see.

00:06:33.373 --> 00:06:35.140
What other goodies are in here?

00:06:35.206 --> 00:06:37.106
‐ How did she
get it all in there?

00:06:37.173 --> 00:06:38.273
‐ Don't know.

00:06:39.873 --> 00:06:40.840

00:06:40.873 --> 00:06:42.206
Oh, hey, you're back!

00:06:42.306 --> 00:06:43.206
‐ Hi, everyone.

00:06:43.306 --> 00:06:44.440
‐ So how's it going, girls?

00:06:44.506 --> 00:06:46.373
‐ Guess what.
Moroha was telling us

00:06:46.473 --> 00:06:48.540
she figured out a way
for them to go back home.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.206
‐ Really? That's great news.

00:06:50.273 --> 00:06:51.540
‐ Is it true?

00:06:51.606 --> 00:06:53.373
‐ But that backpack
you've got there,

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.373
it reminds me of the one
my sister used to have.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.473
‐ Wouldn't taking
all that stuff along

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.313
‐ risk changing history?
‐ It'll be fine.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.180
We'll tell everyone
it's secret demon magic stuff.

00:07:04.213 --> 00:07:05.513
Oh! That's right.

00:07:05.546 --> 00:07:06.546
‐ Mm? [gasps]

00:07:06.646 --> 00:07:08.480
‐ Take care of this, would you?

00:07:08.546 --> 00:07:09.880
‐ [giggles]
‐ Hmm?

00:07:09.946 --> 00:07:11.513
[yelps]

00:07:11.546 --> 00:07:13.313
When did she spend this all?!

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.513
‐ Your adorable niece just
needed to do a little shopping.

00:07:16.546 --> 00:07:17.780
‐ [nervous laugh]

00:07:17.846 --> 00:07:20.113
Oh, yeah, real adorable.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.513
‐ Alright!
Our preparations are complete!

00:07:23.546 --> 00:07:26.113
Time to make our grand return
to the Warring Age!

you were in here.

Can I talk to you for a sec?

00:07:42.713 --> 00:07:44.480
‐ Sure. What is it?

00:07:45.613 --> 00:07:48.613
‐ Well‐‐Oh, she's really pretty.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.546
Are these pictures
of your older sister?

00:07:50.646 --> 00:07:53.280
‐ Uh‐huh. That's Kagome.

00:07:53.346 --> 00:07:55.180
‐ What kind of person was she?

00:07:55.213 --> 00:07:57.780
‐ Well, let's see.
She was always causing a ruckus,

00:07:57.846 --> 00:08:00.113
but in a very different way
than you do.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.520
‐ [gasps] I'm sorry for
causing trouble all the time.

00:08:03.553 --> 00:08:05.820
I don't know why
I'm always so selfish.

00:08:05.886 --> 00:08:08.720
‐ [laughs]
You are just like her.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.220
And she also went
to the Feudal Era.

00:08:11.286 --> 00:08:13.886
‐ [gasps] How'd you know I‐‐

00:08:13.953 --> 00:08:15.220
‐ Well, it's true, right?

00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:17.386
You want to go with them.

00:08:17.453 --> 00:08:18.786
‐ But I still
haven't repaid you

00:08:18.853 --> 00:08:20.486
for raising me
all these years.

00:08:20.553 --> 00:08:22.720
‐ You don't owe us anything.

was coming sooner or later,

the night I found you

00:08:28.686 --> 00:08:31.620
barefoot and alone
in front of the Sacred Tree.

00:08:31.686 --> 00:08:34.220

I'll still end up

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.386
causing more trouble for you
in the long run.

00:08:37.786 --> 00:08:40.186

have to worry about us.

‐ Hey! That's awesome.

00:09:01.726 --> 00:09:03.560
Give them my regards, will you?

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:04.860
‐ Moroha.
‐ Hmm?

00:09:04.893 --> 00:09:08.160
‐ If you see Kagome,
please tell her I said hi.

00:09:08.226 --> 00:09:10.560
‐ Uh, yeah, you got it.

00:09:10.626 --> 00:09:12.726
Though I don't really know her.

00:09:12.826 --> 00:09:14.693
‐ I can't believe
we're sending off

a once‐in‐500‐year prodigy
to the Feudal Era.

00:09:17.826 --> 00:09:20.360
Just promise
you'll take care of that violin.

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:21.660
‐ Yes. Thank you.

00:09:21.726 --> 00:09:23.860
And I'll play on nights
I can't sleep.

00:09:23.893 --> 00:09:25.360
‐ I'm going now.

00:09:25.393 --> 00:09:26.726
‐ Take care of yourself.

00:09:26.793 --> 00:09:27.793
‐ I'll miss you!

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.660
‐ Come back, OK?
‐ Eh?

00:09:29.726 --> 00:09:31.893
‐ You have to promise
that you'll come back!

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.826
You, too, Setsuna!
Same for you, Moroha!

00:09:34.893 --> 00:09:37.226
All three of you
better come home!

00:09:38.726 --> 00:09:40.293
‐ [sighs]

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.460
[chuckles]

00:09:41.526 --> 00:09:43.660
‐ [gasps]
‐ Come here.

00:09:43.726 --> 00:09:45.726
I'm gonna miss you, too, Mei.

00:09:45.826 --> 00:09:48.660
I can't make a promise,
but I'll do my best.

00:09:48.726 --> 00:09:49.860
‐ That's no fair!

00:09:49.893 --> 00:09:51.226
You have to promise me!

00:09:51.326 --> 00:09:52.726
‐ Oh, alright.

00:09:52.826 --> 00:09:54.360
Once we get
Setsuna's dreams back,

00:09:54.393 --> 00:09:55.660
I'll come home for sure.

00:09:55.726 --> 00:09:58.660
Come on, you two.
We have to promise Mei.

00:09:58.726 --> 00:10:01.466
‐ The Warring Age isn't
a place out of fairy tales.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.166
If you're not prepared to die‐‐

00:10:03.266 --> 00:10:06.333
‐ I am prepared, but that
doesn't mean I plan on dying.

00:10:06.433 --> 00:10:08.266
And, hey,
if I'm vigilant enough,

00:10:08.333 --> 00:10:10.400
I know that I
can make it home safely.

00:10:10.466 --> 00:10:11.466
‐ [scoffs]

00:10:13.333 --> 00:10:16.233
Alrighty, let's get
this show on the road.

00:10:18.833 --> 00:10:20.500
Hey, Root Head!

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.166
We have something
you can't get from this era,

00:10:23.266 --> 00:10:25.600
three Rainbow Pearls
chock‐full of demon power!

00:10:25.666 --> 00:10:27.566
I know you've been
wanting these babies!

00:10:31.266 --> 00:10:32.566
All we ask in return

00:10:32.633 --> 00:10:34.733
is to let us pass back through
to the Warring Age,

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.166
and then we'll let you have

00:10:36.233 --> 00:10:38.333
the Gold, Silver,
and Red Rainbow Pearls.

00:10:38.433 --> 00:10:40.166
Sound good, Root Head?

00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:44.266
Eh?

00:10:44.333 --> 00:10:46.500
[Root Head roars]

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.133
Fine! We have a deal!

00:10:52.333 --> 00:10:53.433
‐ Hmm?

00:10:54.833 --> 00:10:57.233
‐ Lady Kaede,
do you see that light?

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.673
‐ Indeed. It's coming
from the Sacred Tree.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:01.740
‐ I think you're right.

00:11:01.806 --> 00:11:03.506
Is Setsuna coming back?

00:11:03.606 --> 00:11:05.140
‐ She just might be.

00:11:05.173 --> 00:11:06.173
‐ [gasps] Kirara.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.573
[Kirara roars]

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.240
‐ I'll notify Uncle Kohaku!

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:14.640
‐ OK, this is it!

00:11:14.673 --> 00:11:16.240
‐ It's the same as before.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.073
‐ Oh! That's my backpack!
Damn it!

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.340
‐ Hey, wait, you two!

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.340
‐ Give it back!

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.340
‐ Come on. [gasps]

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.440
‐ [stifled crying]

00:11:31.506 --> 00:11:32.806
‐ Thank you...

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.506
for being my family.

00:11:34.606 --> 00:11:35.506
See you soon.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.473
‐ It's a promise!

00:11:38.506 --> 00:11:40.306
I love you, Towa!

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.273
I love all of you!

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.273
[insects chirping]

00:11:46.173 --> 00:11:48.173
‐ I'm sure they'll come home.

00:11:48.273 --> 00:11:49.673
‐ Of course they will.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.173
They're our family.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.806
‐ They're my adorable
great‐grandchildren.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.573
‐ Yes, they are.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.573
No doubt about it.

00:11:59.913 --> 00:12:01.180
‐ <i>That's right.</i>

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.580
<i>When I was four,</i>

00:12:02.646 --> 00:12:05.813
<i>I passed through</i>
<i>this exact same corridor.</i>

00:12:05.846 --> 00:12:08.313
<i>The Feudal Era is ahead of us.</i>

00:12:08.346 --> 00:12:11.313
<i>Setsuna's dreams</i>
<i>were stolen there.</i>

00:12:11.346 --> 00:12:12.746
<i>Don't worry.</i>

00:12:12.813 --> 00:12:14.680
<i>I promise</i>
<i>I'll get them back for you.</i>

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:16.346
‐ Moroha, are you sure

00:12:16.413 --> 00:12:18.646
it was wise
to make a deal with Root Head?

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.313
‐ Oh, yeah. It'll be fine.

00:12:20.346 --> 00:12:23.646
If it comes down to it,
I have no problem killing him.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.646
Mm, wait a minute, Setsuna.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.680
Did you just call me by my name?

00:12:27.746 --> 00:12:29.680
‐ [sighs]

00:12:29.746 --> 00:12:30.680
Is that a problem?

00:12:32.346 --> 00:12:34.813
‐ Nope, not at all!
I kinda like it!

00:12:34.846 --> 00:12:36.480
‐ Yes, it is a problem!

00:12:36.513 --> 00:12:37.780
You lied to him.

00:12:37.846 --> 00:12:38.813
You should be ashamed!

00:12:38.846 --> 00:12:40.080
‐ It wasn't a lie.

00:12:40.146 --> 00:12:41.780
It was a means to an end.

00:12:41.846 --> 00:12:42.780
Eh...

00:12:42.846 --> 00:12:44.113
[gasps]

00:12:47.346 --> 00:12:49.080
[water dripping]

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.613
‐ [echoing] A decade's
worth of time has passed.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.813
The Half‐Demon Princesses
travel beneath my feet.

00:12:58.846 --> 00:13:01.353
If my predictions are correct,

00:13:01.453 --> 00:13:04.620
then those three
will indeed save the world.

00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:09.853
For now, I shall
allow Root Head to dream.

00:13:12.286 --> 00:13:14.486
‐ Are we in the Feudal Era?

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.120
MOROHA: No. Something's off.

00:13:16.186 --> 00:13:17.186
SETSUNA: Stay alert.

00:13:17.286 --> 00:13:19.186
‐ You took us
down the wrong path,

00:13:19.286 --> 00:13:20.320
didn't you, Moroha?

00:13:20.353 --> 00:13:21.786
‐ How was I supposed to do that

00:13:21.853 --> 00:13:23.420
when there was only one path?

00:13:23.486 --> 00:13:26.320
‐ Towa, you should be aware,

00:13:26.353 --> 00:13:29.253
in the Warring Age,
there's no room for hesitation.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.620
‐ Yeah, I get that.

00:13:30.686 --> 00:13:32.586
‐ If you don't strike down
your enemy first,

00:13:32.653 --> 00:13:33.853
they will kill you.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.186
‐ If it's just you,
then it's fine,

00:13:36.253 --> 00:13:38.420
but if you're gonna screw up
and get yourself killed,

00:13:38.486 --> 00:13:41.153
try not to drag us down
with you.

00:13:41.186 --> 00:13:43.286
‐ Wow, thanks a bunch.

00:13:43.353 --> 00:13:44.420
‐ Up ahead.
‐ [gasps]

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.486
‐ What is that thing?

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.620
‐ [echoing] I've been expecting
you, Half‐Demon Princesses.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.426
‐ [echoing] I've expected you,
Half‐Demon Princesses.

00:14:03.493 --> 00:14:04.693
‐ What do you mean?

00:14:04.793 --> 00:14:06.760
Are you referring to us?

00:14:06.826 --> 00:14:08.693
‐ This isn't Root Head, is it?

00:14:08.793 --> 00:14:11.460
‐ Don't think so.
There's no demon energy.

00:14:11.493 --> 00:14:12.793
‐ Tell us who you are.

00:14:12.826 --> 00:14:15.360
‐ I am the Tree of Ages.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:16.826
‐ Is the Tree of Ages

00:14:16.926 --> 00:14:18.793
supposed to look
like a priestess, or what?

00:14:18.826 --> 00:14:22.793
‐ No. This is only
a borrowed appearance.

00:14:22.826 --> 00:14:25.660
The form you see
before you was created

00:14:25.693 --> 00:14:27.660
from the spirit of the arrowhead

00:14:27.693 --> 00:14:31.660
from the Arrow of Sealing
that was embedded in my trunk.

00:14:31.693 --> 00:14:33.693
I believe
the name of the priestess

00:14:33.793 --> 00:14:36.326
to whom it belonged was Kikyo.

00:14:36.426 --> 00:14:37.926
MOROHA: Kikyo?

00:14:37.993 --> 00:14:40.260
SETSUNA: Are you the one
who summoned us to this place?

00:14:40.326 --> 00:14:41.860
‐ Yes, I am.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.660
I have a request,
daughters of Sesshomaru.

00:14:44.693 --> 00:14:45.660
Now listen.

00:14:45.693 --> 00:14:47.293
‐ Hoo hoo! See?

00:14:47.326 --> 00:14:49.360
I told you you were his kids!

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:50.460
Hey, wait a second!

00:14:50.493 --> 00:14:51.826
Sorry to break it to you,

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:53.660
but I'm not
Sesshomaru's daughter.

00:14:53.693 --> 00:14:57.326
‐ Save your complaints until
I am done speaking, Moroha.

00:14:57.426 --> 00:14:58.593
‐ [sputters] Wait.

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.333
How did the tree know my name?

00:15:00.433 --> 00:15:02.766
‐ Alright, then.
Tell us your request.

00:15:02.833 --> 00:15:05.666
‐ There is a demon
I would like you to slay.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.800
MOROHA: You got it!

00:15:06.833 --> 00:15:07.966
It's Root Head, right?

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.300
‐ It's not.

00:15:09.333 --> 00:15:11.600
Root Head is of no consequence.

00:15:11.666 --> 00:15:14.833
The one I want slain
is the Beast King Kirinmaru.

00:15:14.933 --> 00:15:16.466
‐ [gasps]
‐ Kirinmaru?

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.833
‐ He's attempting to twist time,

00:15:18.933 --> 00:15:21.433
swallow this world
into the Degenerate Age,

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.333
and return it
back to nothingness.

00:15:24.433 --> 00:15:28.300
Kirinmaru is a king who,
alongside the Great Dog‐Demon,

00:15:28.333 --> 00:15:31.266
had long reigned
over the demon beasts.

00:15:31.333 --> 00:15:34.627
Kirinmaru ruled in the East.

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.093
Meanwhile, the one
who held power in the West

00:15:37.127 --> 00:15:39.393
was your grandfather,
the Great Dog‐Demon.

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.493
[all gasp]

00:15:40.593 --> 00:15:42.493
‐ The Great Dog‐Demon, huh?

00:15:42.593 --> 00:15:43.493
You don't say.

00:15:43.593 --> 00:15:45.493
I've heard that name before.

00:15:45.593 --> 00:15:47.427
‐ Equal in strength,

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.560
the two warriors
ruled their lands

00:15:49.627 --> 00:15:51.127
while keeping watch
over each other

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.093
to maintain
the balance of power.

00:15:54.127 --> 00:15:56.560
However, your father Sesshomaru

00:15:56.627 --> 00:15:59.927
renounced his birthright
to the Great Dog‐Demon title,

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.900
walking his own path instead.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.300
Taking that as an opportunity,

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.133
Kirinmaru plots to plunge
this world into devastation.

00:16:09.167 --> 00:16:11.100
The power to travel across time

00:16:11.133 --> 00:16:13.633
would be a necessary ability
in order to stop him.

00:16:13.667 --> 00:16:16.133
‐ I see.
So that's where we come in.

00:16:16.167 --> 00:16:17.633
‐ That's correct.

00:16:17.667 --> 00:16:20.467
As ones with deep ties
to the Great Dog‐Demon,

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.933
you three are the world's
best hope to slay Kirinmaru.

00:16:23.967 --> 00:16:27.133
So, Half‐Demon Princesses,
will you accept?

00:16:27.167 --> 00:16:29.133
‐ Don't know about them,
but I'll do it!

00:16:29.233 --> 00:16:31.433
And after I kill him,
I expect there to be

00:16:31.467 --> 00:16:33.600
a great big bounty
waiting for me.

00:16:33.633 --> 00:16:36.300
‐ And what about you,
daughters of Sesshomaru?

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.500
‐ I refuse.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.933
[both gasp]

00:16:38.967 --> 00:16:40.500
‐ You will not take up the task?

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.433
‐ I will not.

00:16:42.467 --> 00:16:43.933
I deny your request.

00:16:43.967 --> 00:16:45.500
‐ For what reason?

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.233
‐ First off,
I do not know this Sesshomaru,

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.333
who you claim to be my father.

00:16:50.433 --> 00:16:52.400
If all this
is due to his failure,

00:16:52.467 --> 00:16:54.933
I see no reason
for us to atone for it.

00:16:54.967 --> 00:16:57.900
If it's necessary
for Kirinmaru to die,

00:16:57.967 --> 00:17:00.940
then Sesshomaru should be
the one who deals with it.

00:17:00.973 --> 00:17:02.607
Tree of Ages,

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.940
you're asking
the wrong people for help.

00:17:04.973 --> 00:17:06.840
‐ [laughs]

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.473
It seems I was correct
to place confidence in you.

00:17:09.507 --> 00:17:10.607
[all gasp]

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.840
‐ Sesshomaru
cannot defeat Kirinmaru.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.073
That is because
these two Beast Kings

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.907
are currently walking
the same path.

00:17:18.973 --> 00:17:21.940
Defeat Kirinmaru,
and Sesshomaru will emerge.

00:17:21.973 --> 00:17:25.273
Similarly, defeat Sesshomaru,
then Kirinmaru will.

00:17:25.307 --> 00:17:28.640
In other words, you must
defeat them at the same time.

00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:30.640
‐ I don't know what you mean.

00:17:30.673 --> 00:17:32.140
‐ This is not in atonement

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.340
for any failures
on Sesshomaru's part.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.973
What I am asking you for

00:17:36.073 --> 00:17:39.140
is to defeat two demons
walking down the wrong path.

00:17:39.173 --> 00:17:41.140
‐ Then that's an even bigger
reason than before

00:17:41.173 --> 00:17:43.307
that we can't do
what you're asking of us!

00:17:43.407 --> 00:17:44.573
[both gasp]

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.173
‐ Even if we've
never met him before,

00:17:46.273 --> 00:17:48.473
you just said Sesshomaru
is our father, didn't you?

00:17:48.573 --> 00:17:50.840
So how could you ask us,
his own daughters,

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:51.907
to do something like that?

00:17:51.973 --> 00:17:53.307
‐[sighs]
‐ Are you telling me

00:17:53.407 --> 00:17:55.507
that the two daughters
of the demon Sesshomaru

00:17:55.607 --> 00:17:58.440
are refusing to accept
my request for their aid?

00:17:58.473 --> 00:18:00.347
‐ Yes, that's right!
You heard me!

00:18:00.447 --> 00:18:01.447
You can count us out!

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.247
‐ [groans]

00:18:03.313 --> 00:18:05.480
‐ It seems you are unfamiliar

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.947
with the consequences
of disobeying the Tree of Ages.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.647
‐ Listen, I won't let anyone

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.480
influence the path
I choose to walk.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.647
‐ Agreed. I will do as I please.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.947
‐ I ask one last time.

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.147
Will you not slay him?

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:20.647
‐ The answer is no.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.347
‐ Yeah. Mine, too!

00:18:22.447 --> 00:18:24.447
‐ Let us pass,
or we'll cut you down.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.013
‐ Are we seriously
doing this right now?

00:18:27.113 --> 00:18:28.447
‐ As you wish.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.647
Fate is a continuous cycle.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.647
We'll meet again.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.247
‐ What?

00:18:34.313 --> 00:18:36.247
‐ Whoa, what the hell?

00:18:36.313 --> 00:18:38.080
‐ Awaken, Root Head.

00:18:38.147 --> 00:18:41.980
The Rainbow Pearls you desired
are going to elude your grasp.

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.280
‐ Lady Kaede, could
this presence actually be...

00:18:48.313 --> 00:18:51.180
‐ Yes. Root Head's
demon power is increasing.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.480
‐ But why?
‐ [all gasp]

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:53.580
‐ We should move back!

00:18:53.647 --> 00:18:54.613
It's too dangerous here!

00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.247
‐ [gasps]

00:18:59.313 --> 00:19:01.353
Hey, are the both of you OK?

00:19:01.453 --> 00:19:02.353
‐ Where are we?

00:19:02.453 --> 00:19:03.620
‐ Uh‐oh.

00:19:03.653 --> 00:19:05.987
Of all the places
she could have sent us,

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.520
the Tree of Ages
delivered us to Root Head.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:10.153
‐ We had a deal.

00:19:10.187 --> 00:19:12.620
Now hand over
the three Rainbow Pearls.

00:19:12.653 --> 00:19:14.187
‐ So this is Root Head.

00:19:14.287 --> 00:19:15.487
‐ Sorry, Roots,

00:19:15.587 --> 00:19:17.420
but we can't give you
the Pearls anymore.

00:19:17.487 --> 00:19:20.153
‐ Then I'll kill you
where you stand.

00:19:20.253 --> 00:19:22.487
‐ Cyclone Burst!

should have a weak spot.

00:19:40.687 --> 00:19:41.953
Wh‐What's going on?

00:19:41.987 --> 00:19:43.420
My Kikujumonji is fading!

00:19:43.487 --> 00:19:46.187
‐ Your demon power is
being drained. That's no good.

00:19:46.287 --> 00:19:48.420
‐ Moroha, is there
any way to stop it?

00:19:48.487 --> 00:19:50.253
‐ Uh, oh, that's right.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.587
My present! [giggles]

00:19:52.653 --> 00:19:54.453
Here we go! Yo!

00:19:54.487 --> 00:19:57.420

of a lucky kappa's foot?!

‐ [laughs]

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.027
Thanks, Grandpa! You were right!

00:20:05.093 --> 00:20:07.127
That old foot
totally brought us good luck!

00:20:07.227 --> 00:20:08.893
‐ We'll hit it all at once.

00:20:08.927 --> 00:20:10.793
Scourge of Swallows!

Hey, that light.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.127
Towa, aim for the spot
right under his eye!

00:20:25.227 --> 00:20:26.193
That's its weak spot.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:27.193
Now finish him off!

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.427
‐ You can't win!

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.593

00:20:30.627 --> 00:20:31.960

‐ Are you OK down there, Moroha?

00:21:04.133 --> 00:21:06.033
This is the Feudal Era, huh?

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.100
‐ KOHAKU: Setsuna!
‐ Eh?

00:21:07.133 --> 00:21:08.267
HISUI: You're back!

00:21:08.367 --> 00:21:09.467
KOHAKU: I'm glad you're safe.

00:21:09.567 --> 00:21:12.267
‐ I am, and I
finally managed to return.

00:21:12.367 --> 00:21:14.033
‐ Thank goodness for that.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.400
What happened to Root Head?

00:21:15.433 --> 00:21:17.933
I can't sense
his demon energy anymore.

00:21:17.967 --> 00:21:19.467
‐ We killed
that crusty old weed.

00:21:19.567 --> 00:21:22.267
‐ You did what?
Is that really true?

00:21:22.367 --> 00:21:23.867
‐ [gasps] <i>That's right.</i>

Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea after all.

00:21:35.433 --> 00:21:39.200
‐ Those girls have
such strong fighting spirits.

00:21:39.267 --> 00:21:43.600
They had the audacity to deny
the wish of the Tree of Ages.

00:21:43.633 --> 00:21:46.400
Are you sure about this?

00:21:46.433 --> 00:21:49.367
If you choose
to forsake this girl,

00:21:49.433 --> 00:21:50.933
she will never awaken.

00:21:59.433 --> 00:22:02.140
I suppose
this is one path as well.

00:22:04.607 --> 00:22:06.940
Perhaps this is
all for the best,

00:22:06.973 --> 00:22:09.273
to remain unchanged.
