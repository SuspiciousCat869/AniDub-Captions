‐ Towa, your ability
to sense demon energy

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:28.722

Beniyasha, as well

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:57.638
‐ Sesshomaru's daughters,
you say?

00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:00.073
‐ I fear they will bring
disaster to your door,

do not take action

00:04:02.142 --> 00:04:04.545

‐ Remind me, Kyuki.
Who is this Tokotsu again?

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:12.753
‐ He was one of the Four Perils
under your command, My Lord,

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.889
the one to whom
you bestowed the Red Pearl.

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.692

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.994
If Tokotsu served under me,

In that case,
don't bother me, 'K?

‐ I'm sorry,
but I can't agree to that.

00:07:45.365 --> 00:07:46.867
I think
we should stick together,

‐ "We're both lost"?

00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:52.038
Don't loop me in with you.
I know exactly where I'm going.

lost your way, right?

‐ Huh? That must be difficult.

00:08:01.247 --> 00:08:03.717
I doubt butterflies
are common at this time of year.

00:08:03.784 --> 00:08:06.587

there are some at Mount Musubi.

I thought you were a samurai,

00:08:22.135 --> 00:08:23.103
‐ Indeed, it is.

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:24.805
That's the one thing
I'm sure of.

00:08:24.905 --> 00:08:26.172
‐ Now I've done it.

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:28.308
I thought I was heading
towards the mountains.

00:08:28.408 --> 00:08:31.244
Leave it to me to end up

this is the ocean?

00:08:54.768 --> 00:08:56.870
‐ [chuckles]
I guess this might be

00:08:56.937 --> 00:08:58.872
a little too small
to be an ocean, huh?

00:08:58.939 --> 00:09:01.107
‐ Even so!
If I follow this river,

00:09:01.174 --> 00:09:02.776
I'm certain to find my way.

00:09:02.843 --> 00:09:05.646

‐ Not really.

00:09:28.034 --> 00:09:30.971
If you focus your energy,
anybody can do this.

00:09:31.004 --> 00:09:33.306
I'm sure you could
if you tried, Princess.

00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:36.209
‐ [gasps] You think so?

00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:38.679
Hey, Mister,
you wanna come and join?

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:41.882
‐ [sighs] Princess,
I don't mean to be rude,

00:09:41.982 --> 00:09:43.316
but I am no "Mister."

00:09:43.349 --> 00:09:46.052
However, you can
call me Riku if you like.

00:09:46.152 --> 00:09:47.688
What's your name, Princess?

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:49.723
‐ Well, I'm no princess.

00:09:49.823 --> 00:09:51.925
My name's Towa Higurashi.

00:09:51.992 --> 00:09:54.394
Riku. I'll be sure to remember.

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:57.230
‐ I'd prefer you remember me

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.000
as Riku the Pirate,
Lady Towa, alright?

00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:01.902
‐ What?! You're a pirate?

00:10:02.002 --> 00:10:05.005
‐ Rest assured, I make sure
not to take anything

00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:07.841
from women,
children, or those in need.

00:10:07.874 --> 00:10:09.009
‐ Hmm.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.846
‐ Wow. These are
all fascinating.

00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:15.381
So, each of these things
are edible?

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:16.449
‐ Help yourself.

00:10:16.517 --> 00:10:18.118
‐ Don't mind if I do!

00:10:21.054 --> 00:10:23.456
Oh, my! It's wonderful!

00:10:23.524 --> 00:10:25.859
This flavor,
there's nothing like it!

00:10:25.926 --> 00:10:29.229
‐ I agree. I think that kind
of apple is delicious, too.

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:31.364
Selective breeding
has really come a long way,

00:10:31.431 --> 00:10:34.367
and the flavor of food
keeps improving over time.

00:10:34.434 --> 00:10:36.369
‐ So this is an apple.

00:10:36.436 --> 00:10:38.939
Unbelievable! A taste like this

00:10:39.039 --> 00:10:41.775
would surely banish you
from paradise.

00:10:41.875 --> 00:10:43.910
‐ Oh, and when
you're all done with it,

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:45.078
I'll take the core.

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:46.479
Can't have it take root

00:10:46.547 --> 00:10:48.214
and mess up
the course of history.

00:10:48.281 --> 00:10:50.283
That would be a disaster.

00:10:50.383 --> 00:10:53.219
‐ I ate the whole thing,
core and all.

00:10:53.286 --> 00:10:55.155
Thank you
for the hospitality.

00:10:57.223 --> 00:10:59.392
As one abandoned by his master,

00:10:59.425 --> 00:11:01.227
it's far more than I deserve.

00:11:01.261 --> 00:11:03.096
‐ Huh?

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:04.831
‐ I'm saying
that you have fed me

00:11:04.898 --> 00:11:06.933
the forbidden fruit, Lady Towa.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.769
‐ Wh‐What do you mean?

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.238
‐ By the way, I'm curious.

00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:15.008
Could that katana
be the Kikujumonji?

00:11:15.075 --> 00:11:17.911
‐ No. It's apparently
a knockoff.

00:11:17.978 --> 00:11:19.513
See? It broke pretty easily.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.014
‐ I should think so.

00:11:21.081 --> 00:11:24.484
The real one should be with
the Deputy Shogun of Kanto,

00:11:24.585 --> 00:11:28.421
Ogigayatsu Hiiragi, as it was
bestowed to him by the shogun.

00:11:28.488 --> 00:11:30.090
‐ The shogun?

00:11:30.123 --> 00:11:31.858
And the deputy shogun?

00:11:31.925 --> 00:11:35.529
‐ Well, anyway, I must repay
your kindness for the apple.

00:11:35.596 --> 00:11:37.097
[tone chimes]

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:42.803
If fate allows it,
I hope we meet again.

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:44.871
Until then, farewell.

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.545
‐ Uh, hang on!

00:11:51.612 --> 00:11:52.546
[gasps]

00:11:52.613 --> 00:11:55.348
Hey! Wait! You forgot this.

00:11:55.448 --> 00:11:58.351
‐ I would like to present that
to you as a gift,

00:11:58.451 --> 00:12:00.153
a reminder of our meeting!

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.354
‐ A gift?

00:12:01.454 --> 00:12:02.355
For me?

00:12:03.456 --> 00:12:05.291
‐ [chuckles]

00:12:05.358 --> 00:12:07.460
<i>I hope you like it,</i>
<i>dear Princess.</i>

00:12:07.528 --> 00:12:08.995
‐ A katana?

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:10.831
Wait. Is this real?

00:12:15.135 --> 00:12:16.970
[sighs] Amazing.

00:12:17.037 --> 00:12:18.839
So this is the real deal.

00:12:20.541 --> 00:12:22.142
<i>‐ I recently stole that katana</i>

00:12:22.208 --> 00:12:24.911
<i>from the deputy shogun's</i>
<i>estate, so rest assured,</i>

00:12:24.978 --> 00:12:27.848
<i>it's definitely</i>
<i>the genuine Kikujumonji.</i>

00:12:29.382 --> 00:12:32.485
‐ And there he goes.
Who was he, anyway?

00:12:32.519 --> 00:12:34.154
‐ [brush rustles]
‐ Hey, you, there!

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.989
‐ [gasps]
‐ Stay where you are!

00:12:36.056 --> 00:12:39.192
We are retainers of the Deputy
Shogun, Ogigayatsu Hiiragi.

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:40.927
‐ [gasps]
‐ So you're the culprit

00:12:40.994 --> 00:12:42.663
who stole that katana
a few days ago.

00:12:42.696 --> 00:12:44.197
‐ Uh, no, I...

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:46.499
‐ We're taking you into custody!

00:12:46.567 --> 00:12:49.235
‐ This is a misunderstanding.
I didn't steal it!

00:12:49.335 --> 00:12:50.504
[Sokyu laughs]

00:12:50.571 --> 00:12:52.906
We've got you,
Princess Half‐Demon.

00:12:53.006 --> 00:12:54.541
The clothes you wear,

00:12:54.608 --> 00:12:57.511
there's no doubt in my mind that
they're from the other world.

00:12:57.578 --> 00:12:59.245
‐ <i>An apparition?</i>

00:12:59.345 --> 00:13:03.016
‐ Sir Sokyu, these must be
her tea‐ceremony supplies.

00:13:03.049 --> 00:13:05.051
‐ Bring it all
back to the estate.

00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:06.052
‐ Yes, sir.

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:08.021
‐ [gasping]

00:13:20.433 --> 00:13:22.969
‐ Do I address
the Princess Half‐Demon?

00:13:23.069 --> 00:13:25.238
I am Deputy Shogun of Kanto.

00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:27.974
My name is
Ogigayatsu Hiiragi Danjo.

00:13:28.074 --> 00:13:30.410
‐ The name's Towa Higurashi.

00:13:30.443 --> 00:13:33.980
Sorry to burst your bubble,
but I'm no Princess Half‐Demon.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.317
‐ She claims this is
a mistake in identity, Sokyu.

00:13:37.417 --> 00:13:40.621
‐ My Lord, by your leave,
please allow me.

00:13:40.654 --> 00:13:43.323
My young princess,
this is a manuscript

00:13:43.423 --> 00:13:45.058
you had on your person,
is it not?

00:13:46.126 --> 00:13:47.293
‐ <i>That idiot!</i>

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:49.429
<i>Why'd she have to bring</i>
<i>that back with her?</i>

00:13:49.462 --> 00:13:51.131
Here's some friendly advice.

00:13:51.231 --> 00:13:54.000
You should let me go right now
if you know what's good for you,

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.236
or else you're
really not gonna like it

00:13:56.302 --> 00:13:58.004
when my friends get here.

00:13:58.104 --> 00:13:59.806
‐ [laughs]

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.474
Such nonsense.

00:14:01.575 --> 00:14:04.177
I have something
I would like for you to see.

00:14:04.277 --> 00:14:05.178
[claps]

00:14:07.814 --> 00:14:09.516
‐ [gasps] A bicycle seat?!

00:14:09.616 --> 00:14:12.418
‐ Ah, so you
recognize this object.

00:14:12.485 --> 00:14:13.654
‐ So it would seem.

00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:15.522
She at least
knows something about it.

00:14:15.622 --> 00:14:18.024
‐ What's a thing like that
doing here?

00:14:18.124 --> 00:14:20.260
‐ [laughs]

00:14:20.326 --> 00:14:22.763
There used to be rumors
in the Musashi Province.

00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:25.331
You see, the story goes
that a priestess arrived

00:14:25.365 --> 00:14:26.600
through the Bone Eater's Well

00:14:26.667 --> 00:14:28.669
from a faraway land
called Tokyo.

00:14:28.769 --> 00:14:29.703
‐ <i>Tokyo?</i>

00:14:29.803 --> 00:14:32.673
<i>Well? Priestess?!</i>

00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:36.142
‐ She and a half‐demon
by the name of Inuyasha

00:14:36.176 --> 00:14:39.546
were known to traverse the land
slaying demons of all sorts.

00:14:39.646 --> 00:14:42.849
Listen well, for what
I'm about to share with you

00:14:42.883 --> 00:14:45.786
is a tale that I heard
over a decade ago.

00:14:47.888 --> 00:14:49.355
SETSUNA: She went
to Mount Musubi

00:14:49.455 --> 00:14:50.691
to find the butterfly?

00:14:50.791 --> 00:14:53.694
‐ She had mentioned wanting
to prove you could rely on her

00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:56.630
and that she wasn't a nuisance
before she set out.

00:14:56.697 --> 00:14:59.232
‐ The moment the collar
comes off, she runs away.

00:14:59.332 --> 00:15:02.202
And here I thought
she was being happily tamed.

00:15:02.302 --> 00:15:05.405
‐ Are you heading
to Mount Musubi as well?

00:15:05.506 --> 00:15:07.307
‐ No. I am going

00:15:07.373 --> 00:15:10.410
to fetch the dog
that strayed from the pack.

00:15:10.511 --> 00:15:14.347
‐ Hmm. My next bounty's Kyuki,
one of the Four Perils.

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:17.551
Interesting how these requests
to take out big‐name demons

00:15:17.584 --> 00:15:19.252
keep rolling in,
don't you think?

00:15:19.352 --> 00:15:21.421
Who keeps putting in
for these jobs?

00:15:21.522 --> 00:15:23.757
I bet you know something,
Takechiyo.

00:15:23.857 --> 00:15:25.859
‐ It's better
that you don't ask.

00:15:25.892 --> 00:15:27.661
Master Jyubei said the requests

00:15:27.728 --> 00:15:30.564
are from someone
he can't refuse, no matter what.

00:15:30.664 --> 00:15:32.232
‐ Is that right?

00:15:32.332 --> 00:15:35.769
‐ Master Jyubei has graciously
given you advance payment.

00:15:35.869 --> 00:15:37.237
You need to stop your whining

00:15:37.337 --> 00:15:38.905
and do the job
he paid you to do!

00:15:38.939 --> 00:15:41.241
‐ OK, OK! I get it!

00:15:42.909 --> 00:15:45.579
‐ She definitely
passed through here,

00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:47.748
but Mount Musubi's
in the other direction.

00:15:47.848 --> 00:15:50.751
‐ Yo, Setsuna! Guess what.

00:15:50.851 --> 00:15:53.887
I got us another demon slaying
job from Mr. Jyubei.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.722
‐ You did, eh?

00:15:55.756 --> 00:15:56.790
‐ [grunts]

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:58.358
Hey, where's Towa?

00:15:58.424 --> 00:15:59.593
She's always with you.

00:15:59.626 --> 00:16:02.563
Looks like
she got herself lost somewhere.

00:16:02.596 --> 00:16:05.265
I've tried to reach her,
but got no response.

00:16:05.365 --> 00:16:08.434
‐ [scoffs]
So as usual, she's hopeless.

00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:11.404
‐ That seems strange.
Master Jyubei says

00:16:11.437 --> 00:16:13.874
that out of the three of you
Half‐Demon Princesses,

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.476
Towa is the most reliable
by a landslide.

00:16:16.577 --> 00:16:17.944
‐ Well, that's nonsense.

00:16:17.978 --> 00:16:20.581
Unless you mean
reliably useless, of course.

00:16:20.614 --> 00:16:22.583
‐ She's not, and this proves it.

00:16:22.616 --> 00:16:24.918
She's already close
to where Kyuki is located.

00:16:24.951 --> 00:16:26.887
‐ What? No way!
‐ It's true!

00:16:26.953 --> 00:16:29.890
She got an audience
with Ogigayatsu Hiiragi Danjo,

00:16:29.956 --> 00:16:31.491
the Deputy Shogun.

00:16:31.592 --> 00:16:33.293
I bet he's already
giving her a gift

00:16:33.393 --> 00:16:34.761
as a reward for her deeds.

00:16:35.962 --> 00:16:37.463
‐ Something is not right.

00:16:38.565 --> 00:16:40.300
‐ Hey, Setsuna, wait up!

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:42.936
It's the deputy shogun's
estate, right?

00:16:42.969 --> 00:16:44.638
Can you take us there,
Takechiyo?

00:16:44.738 --> 00:16:47.307
‐ Alright, but if I do,
you better make sure

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.475
to get Kyuki's head.
You got that?!

00:16:50.977 --> 00:16:52.913
[Kyuki laughs]

00:16:52.979 --> 00:16:55.816
So you're on your way,
Half‐Demon Princesses.

00:16:55.849 --> 00:16:58.418
With the Gold,
Silver, and Red Pearls

00:16:58.484 --> 00:17:00.654
all gathered together,
in one fell swoop,

00:17:00.754 --> 00:17:03.690
I will have four of them
neatly within my grasp.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:05.926
If I succeed,
I will have amassed

00:17:05.992 --> 00:17:09.696
more demon power
than even Lord Kirinmaru.

00:17:09.796 --> 00:17:11.832
Fubuki, I command you

00:17:11.865 --> 00:17:14.500
to steal the Rainbow Pearls
from those two.

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:17.337
[laughs]

00:17:17.437 --> 00:17:18.705
No need to worry.

00:17:18.805 --> 00:17:20.707
We can let Yotsume take care

00:17:20.807 --> 00:17:23.343
of collecting the Silver Pearl
from the other girl.

00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:25.712
SOKYU: That demon
was called Root Head,

00:17:25.812 --> 00:17:28.649
It burrowed underground,
absorbing nutrients from humans,

00:17:28.682 --> 00:17:31.017
meaning the local villages
were in danger.

00:17:34.988 --> 00:17:36.456
‐ [rumbling]
‐ [both grunt]

00:17:36.523 --> 00:17:37.891
‐ Something's coming.

00:17:40.827 --> 00:17:42.529
‐ [growling]

00:17:45.532 --> 00:17:47.467
[roaring]

00:17:49.469 --> 00:17:50.504
[Takechiyo yelps]

00:17:50.537 --> 00:17:52.238
‐ It was waiting to ambush us.

00:17:52.338 --> 00:17:53.707
‐ Is that thing Kyuki?

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:57.310
TAKECHIYO: No, that's one
of Kyuki's underlings, Fubuki!

00:17:57.377 --> 00:17:58.979
‐ I've heard of it before.

00:17:59.045 --> 00:18:00.714
It's an ice
and snow demon beast,

00:18:00.814 --> 00:18:02.015
and it nests in the north.

00:18:02.048 --> 00:18:03.584
‐ Ice and snow.

00:18:03.684 --> 00:18:05.318
‐ [shell clicks]
‐ Moroha!

00:18:05.385 --> 00:18:07.387
‐ I've got this.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.689
‐ No, save your strength.

00:18:08.722 --> 00:18:10.891
I'll take out that vermin.

00:18:10.991 --> 00:18:12.893
Scourge of Swallows!

00:18:14.561 --> 00:18:16.496
‐ [groans]

00:18:18.398 --> 00:18:19.399
[grunts]

00:18:19.499 --> 00:18:20.734
[roars]

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:23.336
[Takechiyo yelps]

00:18:24.404 --> 00:18:25.338
[squeals]

00:18:25.405 --> 00:18:27.407
It's like
I was attacking the air.

00:18:27.508 --> 00:18:28.709
‐ That's not it.

00:18:28.742 --> 00:18:31.077
Most of that beast is
pretty much made up of just fog.

00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:33.580
Its main body
is hiding out somewhere.

00:18:33.614 --> 00:18:36.049
Question is, how do we find it?

00:18:36.082 --> 00:18:38.051
‐ But then, Root Head
opened his great maw...

00:18:38.084 --> 00:18:40.587
<i>‐ Setsuna and Moroha</i>
<i>are close by.</i>

00:18:40.687 --> 00:18:43.924
‐ ..."I'll eat you whole,
Shikon Jewel and all," you see?

00:18:44.024 --> 00:18:47.427
<i>‐ Apparitions sure do</i>
<i>run their mouths a lot.</i>

00:18:49.429 --> 00:18:51.431
<i>And I'm sensing</i>
<i>another one nearby.</i>

00:18:51.532 --> 00:18:54.535
<i>It's small, but it's</i>
<i>definitely an apparition.</i>

00:18:57.037 --> 00:18:58.539
‐ [soft growling]
‐ <i>There.</i>

00:18:58.605 --> 00:19:02.576
<i>Setsuna and Moroha must be</i>
<i>fighting that tiny polar bear.</i>

00:19:02.609 --> 00:19:06.446
<i>Come on. Focus.</i>
<i>I have to help Setsuna.</i>

00:19:11.451 --> 00:19:12.485
[gasps]

00:19:12.586 --> 00:19:14.555
‐ [growling]

00:19:14.621 --> 00:19:16.056
‐ [gasps] There!

00:19:16.122 --> 00:19:17.924
I sense Towa's energy.

00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:19.059
‐ Yeah? Where?

00:19:19.125 --> 00:19:20.761
‐ She's in a village
off that way!

00:19:20.794 --> 00:19:22.996
Fubuki's main body
is there, too.

00:19:23.096 --> 00:19:25.131
‐ I see. So that's how it is.

00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:26.132
OK, then.

00:19:29.603 --> 00:19:31.805
Bingo! There's the main body!

00:19:33.473 --> 00:19:34.575
Yo, hit the mark.

00:19:34.641 --> 00:19:35.976
Sacred Arrow!

00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:37.644
‐ [roars]

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:40.080
‐ [gasps]

00:19:41.481 --> 00:19:42.415
‐ <i>Now!</i>

00:19:43.517 --> 00:19:44.484
‐ [growls]

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.454
[yelps]

00:19:48.488 --> 00:19:50.757
‐ <i>Yes! We did it.</i>

00:19:50.824 --> 00:19:52.793
‐ [roars]

00:19:58.832 --> 00:20:00.000
‐ Hate to say it,

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.003
but I think what
Mr. Jyubei said might be true.

00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:04.470
‐ About what?

00:20:04.505 --> 00:20:06.873
‐ You know, about Towa
being the most reliable one

00:20:06.973 --> 00:20:07.974
out of the three of us.

00:20:08.008 --> 00:20:09.543
‐ [grunts] Maybe,

00:20:09.643 --> 00:20:11.945
but she also causes
the most trouble.

00:20:15.015 --> 00:20:18.018
‐ Now, Princess Half‐Demon,
let's waste no more time.

00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:19.986
You must tell us
how you came here.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.855
I'm sure you must know.

00:20:21.955 --> 00:20:24.691
Tell us, what will happen
to the shogunate?

00:20:24.725 --> 00:20:26.560
What is the fate of our clan?

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:27.994
‐ Excellency...

00:20:28.028 --> 00:20:29.996
‐ Hmm? What is it?

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:31.565
‐ Run away.

00:20:31.665 --> 00:20:32.699
‐ What?

00:20:32.799 --> 00:20:33.900
‐ [door rattles]
‐ H‐Hey!

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.001
‐ There's an intruder!
‐ [scuffling]

00:20:35.035 --> 00:20:36.837
‐ You'll get hurt if you stay.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.471
‐ Who are you?!
‐ Time's running out.

00:20:38.539 --> 00:20:39.540
‐ [yelps]

00:20:39.573 --> 00:20:41.508
‐ [gasps] What's happening?

00:20:41.542 --> 00:20:43.644
‐ GUARD: Stop!
‐ MOROHA: Shut up!

00:20:44.878 --> 00:20:46.713
Man, these guards are soft!

00:20:46.813 --> 00:20:49.716
Towa, let's get going, already!

00:20:49.816 --> 00:20:51.885
We don't have time to waste
in a place like this.

00:20:51.985 --> 00:20:54.588
‐ You really are a handful.

00:20:57.524 --> 00:20:59.660
‐ Thanks, Setsuna,
and you, too, Moroha.

00:20:59.726 --> 00:21:01.862
‐ I demand answers.
Who are you?

00:21:01.895 --> 00:21:04.230
‐ Well,
it's kind of a long story.

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:06.432
Eh? [sniffs]

00:21:06.533 --> 00:21:07.868
Aha! Yup!

00:21:07.901 --> 00:21:10.203
I knew that something
smelled funny around here!

00:21:10.236 --> 00:21:12.072
So it's you, Yotsume!

00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:13.073
‐ [groans]

00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:15.175
‐ Well, since you're here,

00:21:15.241 --> 00:21:18.044
I might as well take you out!

00:21:18.078 --> 00:21:19.746
‐ Moroha, don't rush in!

00:21:21.615 --> 00:21:23.784
‐ [groans]
‐ You're an apparition?!

00:21:23.884 --> 00:21:25.085
‐ Oh, shit!

00:21:25.185 --> 00:21:26.452
‐ You brat!

00:21:28.922 --> 00:21:29.890
‐ [gasps]

00:21:36.597 --> 00:21:40.100
‐ Hah! That bird's
a sore loser, isn't he?

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.267
‐ Moroha, wait!
‐ Eh?

00:21:41.301 --> 00:21:43.269
‐ That guy seems
like he might know something.

00:21:43.303 --> 00:21:45.639
It's better if we capture him
and make him talk.

00:21:45.739 --> 00:21:48.241
‐ OK. Well, we still have
to chase him down first!

00:21:50.944 --> 00:21:52.078
‐ [sighs]

00:21:52.112 --> 00:21:53.079
Excellency.

00:21:53.113 --> 00:21:54.080
‐ Eh?

00:21:55.115 --> 00:21:56.783
‐ I'll be taking this.

00:21:58.118 --> 00:21:59.986
‐ Who exactly were those girls?

00:22:00.086 --> 00:22:01.655
‐ Oh, almost forgot.
‐ [gasps]

00:22:03.089 --> 00:22:04.591
‐ I'm taking this, too.

00:22:04.625 --> 00:22:05.626
It is mine.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.761
Gotta go now.

00:22:07.794 --> 00:22:09.963
See you around.

00:22:12.065 --> 00:22:13.967
[Japanese music playing]

00:23:43.724 --> 00:23:46.326
TOWA: <i>The three of us chase</i>
<i>after the owl demon Yotsume</i>

00:23:46.392 --> 00:23:48.762
<i>to get to the bottom</i>
<i>of whatever he's scheming.</i>

00:23:48.862 --> 00:23:51.698
‐ Not so fast!
Heavenly Arrow Barrage!

00:23:51.732 --> 00:23:54.334
TOWA: <i>But then he uses</i>
<i>the power of a Rainbow Pearl</i>

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.202
<i>and casts a dirty spell on us!</i>

00:23:56.236 --> 00:23:58.071
SETSUNA: <i>He's peering</i>
<i>inside our minds</i>

00:23:58.171 --> 00:23:59.906
<i>to look for weaknesses.</i>

00:24:00.006 --> 00:24:01.374
TOWA: <i>Who is this woman?</i>

00:24:01.407 --> 00:24:05.278
<i>Next time on</i> Yashahime,
<i>"The Dream Gazing Trap."</i>

00:24:05.378 --> 00:24:07.013
KIKYO: <i>The poor soul.</i>

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:10.183
<i>Don't you agree,</i>
<i>daughter of Sesshomaru?</i>
