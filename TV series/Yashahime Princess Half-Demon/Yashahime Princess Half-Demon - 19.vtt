‐ Uh...

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:56.423
‐ Wait a minute.
‐ Who is she?

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:58.325
‐ Were you surprised,
demon slayers?

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:01.161
It was not my father
who called you here, but me.

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:05.132
I am Aiya, the daughter
of Ogigayatsu Hiiragi Danjo.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:06.667
[laughs]

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:08.302
‐ I see.

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:10.404
‐ So she's
the Excellency's daughter?

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:11.638
‐ I guess.

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:14.608
‐ Now, demon slayers,
which one of you is the chief?

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:17.611
HISUI: Unfortunately
our chief is currently absent.

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:20.113
‐ Absent? How vexing.

00:01:20.147 --> 00:01:22.149
I don't know if it's
even worth talking to you

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:24.251
if your chief is not here
to represent you.

00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:26.086
‐ Please! In his absence,

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.089
I'll take full responsibility
in heeding your request.

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:31.291
What is the nature
of the job you have for us?

00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:34.661
‐ Oh! So you're willing
to take his place, are you?

00:01:34.728 --> 00:01:36.563
Are you itching
to know that badly?

00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:37.564
Of course you are!

00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:39.333
You must be pining
to hear me out!

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.035
‐ What? I never said that.

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:43.370
‐ Well, who can blame you?

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:45.472
If you decide
to accept this assignment,

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:47.407
you might even have
the distinguished honor

00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:50.644
of joining the esteemed
mercenary forces of my father.

00:01:50.644 --> 00:01:53.046
[laughs]

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.249
‐ We'd get to serve
under His Excellency?

00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:56.583
‐ That'd be amazing.

00:01:56.617 --> 00:01:58.619
‐ We'd never have to worry
about money again.

00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:01.488
‐ Yes, doesn't that thought
fill you with jubilation?

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:03.423
What more
could you ever ask for?!

00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:05.592
However, what I am
offering you right now

00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:07.628
is in fact
not a demon‐slaying job.

00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:08.629
[all gasp]

00:02:08.662 --> 00:02:11.632

‐ Uh...
‐ [swallows]

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:15.068
‐ A contest?
‐ If you emerge victorious

00:02:15.102 --> 00:02:17.304
in this special exhibition
of mine, then you'll receive

00:02:17.304 --> 00:02:19.306
the privilege
of joining our forces.

00:02:19.306 --> 00:02:20.474
[all gasp]

00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:23.310
‐ Allow me to introduce you
to your opponents.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.213
Come on in, and make
yourself known, bounty hunters!

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:28.215
‐ [laughs] Mmm!

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:30.117
‐ Hmph. [chuckles]

You demon slayers
may be thinking

00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:40.460
this is hardly a challenge
for someone of your talents,

00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:43.063
but if I told you we were
only just getting started,

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:45.165
I'm sure you would grovel
with anticipation.

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.333
[laughs]

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.202
‐ This princess...

00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:50.537
‐ She sure knows
how to amuse herself.

00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:51.538
‐ No kidding.

00:02:51.572 --> 00:02:52.739
‐ Now...

00:02:52.773 --> 00:02:55.542
would you kindly fetch me
the other bounty hunter?

00:02:55.576 --> 00:02:57.077
‐ Let go of me!

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.079
Damn it!
What the hell is going on?!

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:00.480
Someone's got
some explaining to do!

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.715
‐ [laughs]

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:04.251
I hear that you have
a rather unique girl

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:05.752
in your ranks,
demon slayers,

00:03:05.786 --> 00:03:08.388
so taking the Corpse Dealer
Jyubei's recommendation,

00:03:08.422 --> 00:03:11.491
I'm having this girl join
the ranks of the bounty hunters.

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:13.660
That should make things
challenging for you, yes?

00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:16.296
There's no way you could decline
such a thrilling proposal!

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.632
I look forward
to a most grand spectacle!

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:20.667

NANASUKE: If we win,
we can join the Shogunate.

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.614
Can you imagine
how great that would be?

00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:15.549
‐ Yeah, it would, but even so,

00:05:15.582 --> 00:05:17.651
is it really OK
to go ahead with this

00:05:17.718 --> 00:05:19.620
without the Chief's permission,
Hisui?

00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:22.456
‐ My uncle has always
been taking care of us.

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:25.225
It's time for us to repay
some of that kindness.

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.228
Don't worry.
I have a plan in mind.

‐ How'd everything go?

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:34.001
‐ Damn it.

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:36.303
Why do I have to fight
in a stupid contest

00:05:36.303 --> 00:05:37.704
hosted by some spoiled princess?

00:05:37.738 --> 00:05:40.107
I'm a demon killer,
not a gladiator!

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.608
On top of that, I have to attend

00:05:41.642 --> 00:05:44.044
some kind of long,
boring strategy meeting.

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:45.779
‐ There's still
quite a bit of debt left over

00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:48.148
from your former master,
so I'm not really sure

00:05:48.215 --> 00:05:49.483
what you were expecting here.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.152
Any money you earn
from this exhibition

00:05:52.152 --> 00:05:54.154
will go straight
to Master Jyubei.

00:05:54.154 --> 00:05:56.490
‐ Figures.

00:05:56.557 --> 00:05:58.158
‐ Oh, right.
‐ Hmm?

00:05:58.158 --> 00:06:01.495
‐ The demon slayers wanted me
to hand this note off to you,

00:06:01.495 --> 00:06:03.063
so here you go.

00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:05.499
‐ What's this say?

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.969
SETSUNA: You want me
to fight Moroha?

00:06:09.036 --> 00:06:11.271
‐ Yeah. The job
from the princess

00:06:11.305 --> 00:06:13.407
is to battle with a group
of bounty hunters.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.076
I'm not worried
about taking the others on,

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:18.478
but fighting Moroha
will be challenging for sure.

00:06:22.842 --> 00:06:26.512
‐ On the condition that we
keep this a secret from Towa.

Good morning, Moroha.

Where did Setsuna go?

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.502
‐ Uh, where's Setsuna?!

00:06:49.535 --> 00:06:53.105
I have no idea! [laughs]

00:06:53.105 --> 00:06:56.275
‐ Okay. Are you
heading out on a mission?

‐ Something like that.

00:06:57.843 --> 00:06:59.945
‐ But it's so early
in the morning.

00:07:00.012 --> 00:07:02.415
‐ Yeah, it is,
but you gotta get a head start

00:07:02.448 --> 00:07:04.450
when you're about
to jump into a big fight.

00:07:04.517 --> 00:07:05.918
I'll catch you later!

Moroha said she was going off
to do right now?

Wait! "A big fight"?!

Hey! Moroha, wait!

00:07:23.269 --> 00:07:26.439
[groans] I have to let
Setsuna know what's happening.

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:30.943
‐ Phew. I almost let
our little secret slip to Towa.

00:07:30.943 --> 00:07:32.411
‐ You're a real pain
in the rear.

00:07:32.445 --> 00:07:34.847
Remind me why I always
have to come with you on these?

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.216
‐ You forgot already?
If we succeed,

00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:39.452
I agreed to give you
those candies from Towa.

Is this plan
really gonna work, though?

‐ Of course it will.
Our plan is perfect.

00:07:48.194 --> 00:07:51.063

but I guess I have no choice.

00:07:51.097 --> 00:07:52.999

erect a castle from scratch!

00:09:01.567 --> 00:09:03.536
I am Lady, the bounty hunter!

00:09:40.339 --> 00:09:41.907
‐ Wait. Was that my cue?!

00:09:41.941 --> 00:09:44.410
Uh, our bounty!

00:09:44.443 --> 00:09:46.245
ROKUTA: What's up with them?

00:09:46.278 --> 00:09:48.781
NANASUKE: Please don't make us
introduce ourselves like that

00:09:48.848 --> 00:09:51.117
‐ No, let's just
get this over with.

00:09:51.117 --> 00:09:52.918
‐ I agree.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.554
HISUI: Fire!

00:09:55.588 --> 00:09:57.857
‐ Something is
flying towards us.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.393
‐ Everyone, commence attack!

00:10:00.426 --> 00:10:01.894
‐ But they're oil pots!

00:10:01.927 --> 00:10:03.262
How are we
supposed to attack those?!

00:10:03.329 --> 00:10:06.399
‐ [scoffs]
I'll just use my muscles!

00:10:06.432 --> 00:10:08.167
‐ Slow down there, buddy!

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.435
Muscles aren't
gonna solve this.

00:10:09.502 --> 00:10:10.936
Shouldn't we
just make a run for‐‐

00:10:10.936 --> 00:10:13.072
Uhh! That doesn't look good.

00:10:13.105 --> 00:10:14.106
‐ Huh?

00:10:14.106 --> 00:10:16.542
‐ [yelps]
‐ [jabbers]

00:10:16.575 --> 00:10:18.377
[both yell]

00:10:18.411 --> 00:10:20.946
ROKUTA: Really?
That's all it took?

00:10:21.013 --> 00:10:22.381
NANASUKE: The castle's
already burning.

00:10:22.415 --> 00:10:23.382
‐ [sighs]

00:10:23.416 --> 00:10:25.284
‐ The princess wanted to see

00:10:25.351 --> 00:10:26.585
a spectacle, didn't she?

00:10:26.619 --> 00:10:28.187
Then let's keep
more of 'em coming!

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.288
‐ Yes, sir!
‐ Yes, sir!

00:10:31.424 --> 00:10:32.925
‐ [yelps]

00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.293
‐ [pants] Uhh!

00:10:34.293 --> 00:10:36.162
‐ [panting]

00:10:36.195 --> 00:10:37.263
Whoa!

00:10:37.263 --> 00:10:38.331
‐ [jabbers]

00:10:38.364 --> 00:10:39.932
[yelps]

00:10:39.932 --> 00:10:43.336
‐ Wow! I should have expected
no less from the demon slayers.

00:10:43.369 --> 00:10:46.339
Yes! That's it! More fire!

00:10:46.372 --> 00:10:47.340
[laughs]

00:10:47.373 --> 00:10:48.441
‐ [panting]

00:10:48.441 --> 00:10:51.344
[yelps]

00:10:51.377 --> 00:10:53.346
What the hell
are they doing over there?!

00:10:53.379 --> 00:10:55.448
I don't remember this
being part of the plan!

00:10:55.448 --> 00:10:57.249
‐ [gasps]

00:10:57.283 --> 00:10:59.518
‐ [snarls]

00:11:02.355 --> 00:11:04.557
‐ [gasps] Kirara!
Think you can close in

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:06.258
‐ on that area over there?
‐ [snarls]

00:11:06.292 --> 00:11:08.160
‐ [wailing]

00:11:10.863 --> 00:11:13.232
[wood creaking]

00:11:15.267 --> 00:11:16.268
‐ It's going to fall!

00:11:16.268 --> 00:11:19.171
Everyone, run for your lives!

00:11:21.107 --> 00:11:22.274
‐ [grunts]

00:11:22.274 --> 00:11:24.844
Aren't they going
a little too far with this?

00:11:24.877 --> 00:11:25.778
Uh...

00:11:26.912 --> 00:11:28.881
Huh?

00:11:28.914 --> 00:11:31.851
Damn it. I really
wasn't prepared for this.

00:11:31.884 --> 00:11:33.886
‐ TOWA: Moroha!
‐ Uh, huh?

00:11:33.919 --> 00:11:36.288
[Kirara snarls]

00:11:36.288 --> 00:11:38.290
‐ Moroha, I'm here to help you!

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:40.960
‐ Wait. Towa? Why is she here?!

00:11:41.027 --> 00:11:42.161
‐ Climb aboard!

00:11:42.194 --> 00:11:44.897
‐ [snarls]

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:45.998
‐ Huh?
‐ Uh...

00:11:49.101 --> 00:11:51.437
‐ Towa and Kirara?

00:11:51.437 --> 00:11:52.772
Did you tell them?

00:11:52.838 --> 00:11:54.907
‐ No, I didn't. Did you?

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.909
‐ What?! No, 'course not.

00:11:56.942 --> 00:11:59.278
‐ Does any of that
really matter at this point?

00:11:59.345 --> 00:12:01.414
[all stammer]

00:12:01.447 --> 00:12:04.283
‐ Well, whatever the case,
we're in a bit of a bind now.

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.385
‐ We're all
on this ship together.

00:12:06.419 --> 00:12:08.454
No choice
but to weather the storm.

00:12:08.454 --> 00:12:10.856
Let me decide
how to handle Towa.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:20.900
‐ Moroha, why are you
involved in a battle?

00:12:20.933 --> 00:12:23.235
‐ Well, that's because
I had no choice

00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:25.905
but to get myself
involved with it, you know?

00:12:25.938 --> 00:12:28.441
‐ Even if that's the case, why
are you fighting by yourself?

00:12:28.507 --> 00:12:31.844
‐ Uh, well,
I did have a team, but...

00:12:31.877 --> 00:12:34.246
‐ Was this a job
from Mr. Jyubei

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.349
because of the debt
you still owe him?

00:12:36.349 --> 00:12:38.184
‐ Uh, something like that.

00:12:38.217 --> 00:12:39.251
[chuckles]

00:12:39.285 --> 00:12:41.253
‐ This isn't
something to laugh about!

00:12:41.287 --> 00:12:43.556
I wanted to let Setsuna
know what's going on,

00:12:43.589 --> 00:12:45.458
but I wasn't able
to find her anywhere.

00:12:45.524 --> 00:12:47.627
‐ I have a feeling
you'll find her soon.

00:12:47.693 --> 00:12:48.594
‐ Huh?

00:12:48.661 --> 00:12:50.329
‐ Are you looking for me?
‐ [chuckles]

00:12:51.998 --> 00:12:53.332
TOWA: Setsuna!

00:12:53.366 --> 00:12:55.401
‐ We're in the middle
of a battle.

00:12:55.434 --> 00:12:57.336
I advise you
not to get in our way.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:59.405
‐ You're here, too? But why?

00:12:59.438 --> 00:13:02.108
‐ At this moment, I am
simply carrying out my duty

00:13:02.174 --> 00:13:04.010
as a member
of the demon slayers.

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:06.212
‐ Yeah! Right now,
Setsuna and I are squaring off

00:13:06.245 --> 00:13:08.047
in the middle
of an epic battle!

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.950
‐ Then does that mean the people
you're fighting are actually...

00:13:11.017 --> 00:13:12.451
the demon slayers?

00:13:12.518 --> 00:13:14.854
ROKUTA: Hey,
what are we gonna do?

00:13:14.887 --> 00:13:17.456
‐ Yeah, it wasn't in the plan
for Towa to get involved.

00:13:17.523 --> 00:13:20.226
‐ If we give up now,
it'll all be for nothing.

00:13:20.259 --> 00:13:22.595
Setsuna should be reasoning
with Towa right now,

00:13:22.628 --> 00:13:25.531
so let's continue on
with our plan. [grunts]

00:13:25.564 --> 00:13:26.532
[oil pots whistling]

00:13:26.565 --> 00:13:27.500
‐ Eh?
‐ Huh?

00:13:28.567 --> 00:13:29.502
‐ [yelps]

00:13:31.003 --> 00:13:31.937
[yelps]

00:13:32.004 --> 00:13:34.840
‐ [panting]
‐ [yelling]

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.349
‐ This is just awful.

00:13:43.349 --> 00:13:45.518
I'm gonna head over
and talk to the demon slayers.

00:13:45.551 --> 00:13:47.086
‐ No, don't go out there, Towa!

00:13:47.119 --> 00:13:48.621
‐ This is none of your business!

00:13:48.688 --> 00:13:50.289
‐ Huh?

00:13:50.356 --> 00:13:52.558
This whole thing is wrong,
and you know it!

00:13:52.591 --> 00:13:55.094
Why do you and Moroha
have to fight each other?

00:13:55.127 --> 00:13:56.862
All of us here are friends,
aren't we?

00:13:56.896 --> 00:13:59.932
‐ And remind me
who decided such a thing.

00:13:59.999 --> 00:14:01.200
‐ [gasps]

00:14:01.233 --> 00:14:03.869
‐ Once again, Towa,
you're far too soft.

00:14:03.903 --> 00:14:05.504
You only see
what's on the surface

00:14:05.538 --> 00:14:07.273
and not the truth
that's beneath it.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:09.875
‐ [gasps]
‐ Mm‐hmm. Mm‐hmm.

00:14:09.909 --> 00:14:12.578
‐ If you insist
on getting in our way...

00:14:12.611 --> 00:14:14.880
I will have
to take you down as well!

00:14:14.914 --> 00:14:17.016
‐ Uh...

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.521
[explosions rumbling]

00:14:22.521 --> 00:14:23.956
AIYA: Excuse me?

00:14:24.023 --> 00:14:26.192
Why are those girls
just standing around,

00:14:26.192 --> 00:14:27.627
chattering with one another
like that?

00:14:27.693 --> 00:14:29.929
This is the most boring thing
ever to watch!

00:14:29.996 --> 00:14:32.264
Come on!
Fight each other already!

00:14:32.331 --> 00:14:34.266
I wanna see some sparks fly
out there! You hear me?!

00:14:34.333 --> 00:14:36.035
‐ Princess, please,
calm yourself.

00:14:36.068 --> 00:14:37.837
We wouldn't want you
to fall now!

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.038
‐ [gasping]

00:14:42.341 --> 00:14:44.276
Come on, Setsuna.

00:14:44.343 --> 00:14:46.078
I don't want to fight you
like this!

00:14:46.112 --> 00:14:50.016
‐ Yeah, I agree. I think
this is all going a bit too far.

00:14:50.049 --> 00:14:51.217
‐ Silence!

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:53.386
Scourge of Swallows!

00:14:55.921 --> 00:14:58.858
‐ Towa, get the hell
out of the way!

00:14:58.891 --> 00:15:01.260
ROKUTA: Looks like
instead of a grand battle...

00:15:01.294 --> 00:15:03.229
‐ It's become
a sisterly quarrel.

00:15:03.262 --> 00:15:06.565
‐ Never mind all that.
Let's just take care of Moroha.

00:15:06.599 --> 00:15:08.000
Are you still here?

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.235
‐ You betcha!

00:15:09.268 --> 00:15:11.237
‐ [groans]
‐ Towa, are you OK?

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.238
‐ Think so.

00:15:12.271 --> 00:15:13.406
‐ Setsuna, watch it.

00:15:13.439 --> 00:15:14.940
You're being too rough.

00:15:15.007 --> 00:15:17.009
‐ We have to see this through
'til the end.

00:15:17.009 --> 00:15:18.411
‐ You serious?

00:15:18.444 --> 00:15:20.413
‐ [grunts]

00:15:20.446 --> 00:15:22.581
‐ [growls]

00:15:22.615 --> 00:15:25.017
You are unbelievable.

00:15:25.017 --> 00:15:27.853
Fine! If we're really
going through with this,

00:15:27.887 --> 00:15:30.056
I'm gonna win this battle
and take that bounty home!

00:15:30.089 --> 00:15:32.024
‐ The victor shall be me.

00:15:32.024 --> 00:15:34.060
I accepted the job,
and I shall finish it!

00:15:34.093 --> 00:15:35.227
‐ [gasps]

00:15:35.261 --> 00:15:36.996
‐ Crimson Dragon Wave!

00:15:37.029 --> 00:15:38.564
‐ Cyclone Burst!

00:15:38.597 --> 00:15:41.500
‐ Please stop this
pointless fighting, both of you!

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:47.940
‐ My! So this is what a battle
between young ladies looks like?

00:15:48.007 --> 00:15:50.343
How utterly exquisite!
I must see more!

00:15:52.545 --> 00:15:54.213
‐ Hah!

00:15:54.246 --> 00:15:55.614
‐ [yells]

00:15:55.681 --> 00:15:59.218
[both yelling]

00:15:59.251 --> 00:16:01.354
‐ I said stop it, you two!

00:16:04.123 --> 00:16:05.958
If they're
not gonna listen to me,

00:16:06.025 --> 00:16:08.060
I'll have to break it up myself!

00:16:08.094 --> 00:16:10.096
[yells]

00:16:17.003 --> 00:16:20.106
[oil pot whistles]

00:16:20.172 --> 00:16:21.607
[all yelp]

00:16:21.674 --> 00:16:24.343
‐ [yelling]

00:16:26.178 --> 00:16:27.179
What the hell?!

00:16:27.179 --> 00:16:29.081
Why is that thing
following me?

00:16:29.115 --> 00:16:30.416
Go away!

00:16:30.449 --> 00:16:31.951
[yelps]

00:16:32.018 --> 00:16:33.452
‐ [both gasp]
‐ Moroha.

00:16:35.588 --> 00:16:37.857
‐ Was it a dud?

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:39.058
‐ Looks like it.

00:16:40.192 --> 00:16:41.127
Moroha.

00:16:41.193 --> 00:16:42.995
‐ [gasps, groans]

00:16:44.397 --> 00:16:45.998
Ow.

00:16:45.998 --> 00:16:47.833
I'll get you back for this!

00:16:47.867 --> 00:16:48.934
‐ What a relief.

00:16:49.001 --> 00:16:50.169
‐ Maybe for you.
‐ Eh?

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:53.272
‐ Towa, I'm sorry,

00:16:53.339 --> 00:16:55.207
but we need to defeat Moroha.

00:16:55.241 --> 00:16:57.443
‐ Hisui. Not you, too!

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:59.245
‐ Need I remind you, Towa?

00:16:59.278 --> 00:17:02.214
A demon slayer follows
a job through to completion.

00:17:03.349 --> 00:17:05.184
‐ That's just the way it is.

00:17:05.184 --> 00:17:06.852
Now let us do our job.

00:17:06.886 --> 00:17:08.921
‐ There's no way I can do that.

00:17:08.954 --> 00:17:10.876
If you won't leave Moroha alone,

00:17:10.876 --> 00:17:12.878
then I'll protect her
with everything I've got.

00:17:12.911 --> 00:17:15.380
‐ Uh...
‐ That's unfortunate.

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.516
I guess that means
we'll have to go all out, too!

00:17:17.516 --> 00:17:20.419
‐ Wait! You're not actually
being serious, are you?

00:17:20.452 --> 00:17:21.586
[both grunt]

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:23.455
‐ Hiraikotsu!

00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.126
[both gasp]

00:17:32.864 --> 00:17:33.932
[whoosh]

00:17:33.965 --> 00:17:36.301
‐ [gasps] Moroha!

00:17:36.368 --> 00:17:38.704
‐ [laughs]

00:17:38.737 --> 00:17:40.939
[giggles]
What a spectacular show.

00:17:40.972 --> 00:17:43.742
I feel much better now that
she's gotten her just desserts.

00:17:43.775 --> 00:17:46.411
[laughs]

00:17:46.445 --> 00:17:48.547
‐ Then, Princess, does that mean

00:17:48.547 --> 00:17:50.582
you will be enlisting them
in your father's guard?

00:17:50.615 --> 00:17:52.851
‐ [laughs]

00:17:52.884 --> 00:17:54.519
Of course not.

00:17:54.519 --> 00:17:57.689
Father would never consent
to such an agreement.

00:17:57.723 --> 00:18:00.192
That was merely a lie
I spun out of thin air.

00:18:00.225 --> 00:18:01.393
‐ KOHAKU: Thought so.
‐ Eh?

00:18:01.426 --> 00:18:03.395
‐ GUARDS: Hmm?
‐ Who would you be?

00:18:03.428 --> 00:18:04.596
State your name!

00:18:04.629 --> 00:18:07.566
‐ I would be the Chief
of the demon slayers.

00:18:07.599 --> 00:18:09.601
My name is Kohaku.

00:18:09.634 --> 00:18:10.702
‐ [panting]

00:18:10.736 --> 00:18:12.404
Moroha?

00:18:12.437 --> 00:18:15.273
Come on. Wake up.

00:18:16.375 --> 00:18:17.709
Moroha!

00:18:19.878 --> 00:18:22.247
‐ OK, that's a wrap
on the mission.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.682
‐ Now that we've
finished the job,

00:18:23.715 --> 00:18:25.250
we can join the Shogunate!

00:18:25.283 --> 00:18:26.385
‐ Money!

00:18:26.418 --> 00:18:28.854
‐ Hold on. [shudders]

00:18:28.854 --> 00:18:31.957
Money? That's what
all of this was about?!

00:18:32.024 --> 00:18:35.260
How could you guys choose money
over the life of our friend?!

00:18:35.293 --> 00:18:36.895
‐ Relax, Towa.

00:18:36.928 --> 00:18:38.563
I'm right over here.

00:18:39.731 --> 00:18:40.866
‐ [gasps]

00:18:40.866 --> 00:18:44.603
Moroha? Is that you?

00:18:44.636 --> 00:18:46.705
Then who am I holding?

00:18:46.738 --> 00:18:47.806
TAKECHIYO: Hey, Towa.

00:18:47.873 --> 00:18:49.307
‐ [gasps]
‐ [whoosh]

00:18:49.374 --> 00:18:51.309
‐ [chuckles]

00:18:51.376 --> 00:18:53.211
‐ Uh...

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:56.948
‐ <i>Come on. Let's switch.</i>

00:18:57.015 --> 00:18:59.685
‐ I got you covered. [grunts]

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.256
I can disguise my scent
with this, too.

00:19:04.289 --> 00:19:06.258
‐ Towa.

00:19:06.291 --> 00:19:08.360
We should come clean
with you about the battle.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.262
There was a bit more to it.

00:19:10.295 --> 00:19:11.697
How so?

00:19:13.732 --> 00:19:16.768
Wait. You're saying
this fight had a fixed outcome?

00:19:16.802 --> 00:19:18.770
‐ Precisely.
‐ [groans]

00:19:18.804 --> 00:19:21.373
‐ This was all planned
from the beginning.

00:19:21.373 --> 00:19:24.409
‐ Winning the battle,
joining the Shogunate,

00:19:24.443 --> 00:19:27.379
if we can pull that off,
then we'll pretty much be set.

00:19:27.379 --> 00:19:29.281
KOHAKU: That's not
going to happen.

00:19:29.348 --> 00:19:30.215
[Towa gasps]

00:19:33.418 --> 00:19:34.619
BOTH: Welcome back, Chief!

00:19:34.686 --> 00:19:36.855
‐ Sorry to be
the bearer of bad news,

00:19:36.855 --> 00:19:38.857
but the Princess
lied about that offer.

00:19:38.857 --> 00:19:40.392
[demon slayers gasp]

00:19:40.425 --> 00:19:42.427
‐ Oh, come on!
‐ TOWA: Huh?

00:19:44.029 --> 00:19:46.798
‐ Uncle, I'm sorry.
I thought if we won,

00:19:46.865 --> 00:19:48.867
we'd be able to give you
a better life.

00:19:48.867 --> 00:19:51.770
‐ Hisui, listen closely.

00:19:51.803 --> 00:19:55.240
Demon slayers exist in order
to help those who are in need.

00:19:55.273 --> 00:19:56.708
And in order to accomplish this,

00:19:56.708 --> 00:19:59.444
we must put their interests
in front of our own.

00:19:59.478 --> 00:20:01.279
I want you
to etch those thoughts

00:20:01.313 --> 00:20:02.881
deeply upon your heart.

00:20:02.914 --> 00:20:05.550
‐ I've been foolish. Forgive me.

00:20:05.584 --> 00:20:07.352
BOTH: Forgive us as well.

00:20:13.225 --> 00:20:14.526
‐ Unbelievable.

00:20:14.526 --> 00:20:17.295
Offering employment
without my express consent.

00:20:17.362 --> 00:20:19.297
Setting up a grand spectacle.

00:20:19.364 --> 00:20:20.766
Such insolent behavior!

00:20:20.799 --> 00:20:23.602
‐ [winces]
You don't understand, Father!

00:20:23.635 --> 00:20:25.137
I couldn't just do nothing!

00:20:26.405 --> 00:20:27.539
GUARD: Intruder!

00:20:27.539 --> 00:20:28.640
GUARD 2: After them!

00:20:30.375 --> 00:20:31.943
‐ [clatter]
‐ Hmm?

00:20:31.977 --> 00:20:33.879
GUARD 1: Do not
let them through!

00:20:33.912 --> 00:20:36.214
GUARD 2: You are in
the presence of His Excellency!

00:20:36.248 --> 00:20:37.716
MOROHA: Shut up!

00:20:37.749 --> 00:20:39.618
‐ Eh? [gasps]

00:20:39.685 --> 00:20:41.253
[splat]

00:20:41.286 --> 00:20:42.220
[gasps]

00:20:43.889 --> 00:20:45.924
[grumbles]

00:20:45.957 --> 00:20:47.526
That girl sullying my kimono

00:20:47.559 --> 00:20:49.461
made me so upset,
I wanted to scream.

00:20:49.528 --> 00:20:52.698
‐ Be that as it may, there are
some things you cannot do.

00:20:52.698 --> 00:20:53.699
Understand?

00:20:53.699 --> 00:20:55.200
‐ [sobs]

00:20:55.233 --> 00:20:56.868
Forgive me.

00:20:56.902 --> 00:21:00.439
[sobbing]

00:21:00.472 --> 00:21:02.708
I'll never do it again.

00:21:02.708 --> 00:21:03.775
‐ [sighs]

00:21:06.578 --> 00:21:07.879
‐ [grunts]

00:21:07.913 --> 00:21:09.781
[birds chirping]

00:21:12.884 --> 00:21:15.887
‐ Hey, don't be mad at us, Towa.

00:21:15.921 --> 00:21:17.856
We would have told you, but...

00:21:17.856 --> 00:21:19.758
you know you're a terrible liar.

00:21:22.527 --> 00:21:25.564
‐ We only did what we had to,
not that you'd understand.

00:21:32.537 --> 00:21:33.805
[both grunt]

00:21:35.907 --> 00:21:37.776
[both grunt]

00:21:39.044 --> 00:21:41.146
‐ [gasps]

00:21:42.914 --> 00:21:44.416
I was so worried.

00:21:44.449 --> 00:21:45.917
I thought I'd lost you two.

00:21:45.951 --> 00:21:48.720
The fact you're OK, Moroha,

00:21:48.754 --> 00:21:51.456
and you're the same
as always, Setsuna,

00:21:51.523 --> 00:21:55.260
it makes me‐‐it makes me
so relived knowing that.

00:21:55.293 --> 00:21:56.928
‐ [chuckles]

00:21:56.962 --> 00:22:00.399
‐ I would have preferred
if you had yelled at us instead.

00:22:00.432 --> 00:22:02.734
I feel kinda guilty now.

00:22:02.768 --> 00:22:03.735
‐ Yeah.

00:22:12.277 --> 00:22:14.212
[Japanese music playing]

00:23:42.734 --> 00:23:44.603
TOWA: <i>When Setsuna</i>
<i>was still little,</i>

00:23:44.636 --> 00:23:47.130
<i>she lived in a hidden village</i>
<i>beyond the valley.</i>

00:23:47.197 --> 00:23:49.900
SHIORI: You seem to be tied
to a strange destiny.

00:23:49.933 --> 00:23:51.868
SETSUNA: <i>Miss Shiori</i>
<i>is a half‐demon</i>

00:23:51.902 --> 00:23:53.770
<i>with the ability</i>
<i>to create barriers.</i>

00:23:53.803 --> 00:23:55.939
<i>She uses this</i>
<i>to protect her village.</i>

00:23:55.972 --> 00:23:57.207
TOWA: <i>But demons who are after</i>

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.242
<i>the half‐demon children</i>
<i>show up.</i>

00:23:59.276 --> 00:24:02.012
DEMON:
Suffer inside my poison fog!

00:24:02.012 --> 00:24:03.346
TOWA: Next time on Yashahime,

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.282
<i>"The Hidden Village</i>
<i>for Half Demons."</i>

00:24:05.348 --> 00:24:06.783
SETSUNA: If demons come here,

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:09.186
then it's to eat
or kill us half‐demons.
