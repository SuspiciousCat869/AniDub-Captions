is by killing him
once and for all!

00:05:52.333 --> 00:05:54.333

to injure each other.

that are said to increase
our Ka Demon Tribe's powers?

00:06:51.266 --> 00:06:54.100
‐ You're right. I suggest
we call a temporary truce

00:06:54.133 --> 00:06:56.733
until we can claim
those Pearls for ourselves.

00:06:56.766 --> 00:06:57.966

‐ He did say the only way
we would part from one another

00:19:44.666 --> 00:19:47.433
would be after
one of us eventually died.

00:19:47.466 --> 00:19:51.166
But I think somehow
when the two of us were born,

00:19:51.233 --> 00:19:52.766
we inherently knew...

00:19:52.766 --> 00:19:54.233
‐ [gasps]

00:19:54.266 --> 00:19:56.766
‐ that when one of us dies,

00:19:56.766 --> 00:19:59.333
the other would, too.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.333
And that is the fate

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.133
of siblings
who are connected by blood.

00:20:04.166 --> 00:20:06.733
[shudders] My brother,

00:20:06.766 --> 00:20:10.466
you were the reason
that I continued to live.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.233
Even though
we fought constantly,

00:20:14.266 --> 00:20:17.633
we both gave
each other's life meaning.

00:20:17.666 --> 00:20:19.600
[sentimental music playing]

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.100
[both gasp]

00:20:40.166 --> 00:20:41.100
[heart beats]

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.766
[heart beats]

00:20:47.233 --> 00:20:49.233
‐ We got what we came here for.

00:20:49.266 --> 00:20:50.233
‐ [gasps]
‐ Let's go.

00:20:50.266 --> 00:20:52.166
‐ Hey, wait up.
‐ [grunts]

00:20:52.233 --> 00:20:53.433
‐ Setsuna,

00:20:53.433 --> 00:20:56.766
did you by any chance
remember something?

00:20:56.766 --> 00:20:58.166
[gasps]

00:21:00.633 --> 00:21:02.766
‐ I finally caught up to you.
‐ [both gasp]

00:21:05.633 --> 00:21:08.433
‐ Man! You guys are mean!

00:21:08.466 --> 00:21:12.433
I can't believe you'd just up
and leave me behind like that!

00:21:12.433 --> 00:21:13.600
[groans] Eh?

00:21:13.633 --> 00:21:15.733
[panting]

00:21:15.766 --> 00:21:18.433
Hang on.
Where'd those demons go?

00:21:18.433 --> 00:21:20.400
‐ You're looking
at what's left of 'em.

00:21:20.433 --> 00:21:21.800
‐ [groans]

00:21:21.833 --> 00:21:24.400
I knew it. Come on, guys.

00:21:24.433 --> 00:21:27.233
We can't collect our bounty
if they're cremated, damn it!

00:21:28.766 --> 00:21:30.633
[gasping]

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.433
‐ What are you doing, Moroha?

00:21:34.433 --> 00:21:36.133
‐ [whimpers] I thought

00:21:36.166 --> 00:21:38.900
I could bring some
of the ashes back for proof.

00:21:38.933 --> 00:21:41.233
[wind blowing]

00:21:41.266 --> 00:21:42.233
[moans]

00:21:45.833 --> 00:21:49.300
Wait! Don't go! Come back!

00:21:49.333 --> 00:21:51.266
[music playing]

00:22:02.433 --> 00:22:06.500
TOWA: Setsuna, your memories,
they're still...

00:22:11.166 --> 00:22:13.100
[Japanese music playing]

00:23:41.333 --> 00:23:42.766
‐ Let go of me, Chiyo!

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.766
I have to go
and avenge Ma and Pa!

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.500
TOWA: <i>There's a terrible pond</i>

00:23:46.566 --> 00:23:49.266
<i>that devours any person, beast,</i>
<i>or bird that gets too close.</i>

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.400
<i>We set out to slay the demon</i>

00:23:51.433 --> 00:23:54.133
<i>and meet the siblings Hikomaru</i>
<i>and Chiyo along the way.</i>

00:23:54.166 --> 00:23:56.466
MOROHA: That's the one
I saw yesterday.

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:57.833
I'm gonna send you
to the afterlife

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.600
with my Kurikaramaru!

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.500
DEMON: You annoying little brat!
Die!

00:24:02.566 --> 00:24:04.233
TOWA: Next time on Yashahime,

00:24:04.266 --> 00:24:05.633
<i>"Curse of the Man‐Eating Pond"</i>

00:24:05.666 --> 00:24:09.600
POND: How dare you threaten
the resident of this pond?
