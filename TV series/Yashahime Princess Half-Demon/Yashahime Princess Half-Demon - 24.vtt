JAKEN: Totosai! Down here!

00:11:20.493 --> 00:11:21.462
‐ Hmm?
‐ [grunting]

00:11:21.495 --> 00:11:23.299
‐ Oh, it's you, Jaken!

00:11:23.332 --> 00:11:24.769
What brings you here?

00:11:24.802 --> 00:11:26.472
‐ It's Rin! She was crying!

00:11:26.506 --> 00:11:28.142
I need to get
to the battleground

00:11:28.175 --> 00:11:29.311
where her daughters
are fighting!

00:11:29.344 --> 00:11:30.480
Hurry and take me there!

00:11:30.514 --> 00:11:33.152
‐ Looks like we're headed
to the same place.

00:11:33.185 --> 00:11:35.423
But based on how it's going,
I don't think

00:11:35.456 --> 00:11:37.360
‐ we're gonna make it in time.
‐ What?!

00:11:37.427 --> 00:11:39.264
‐ Don't you know
what's happening?

00:11:39.298 --> 00:11:42.003
Yukari no Tachikiri,
the exalted blade,

00:11:42.037 --> 00:11:43.172
will soon be born.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:46.278
‐ [grunting]

00:11:46.312 --> 00:11:48.082
Damn it. He's so strong!

00:11:48.115 --> 00:11:51.088
‐ This is a bit disappointing.
What happened to the girl

00:11:51.121 --> 00:11:53.794
who had the audacity
to land a cut on my cheek?

00:11:53.827 --> 00:11:55.998
‐ [grunting]

00:11:56.031 --> 00:11:58.135
‐ Towa!

00:11:58.169 --> 00:12:00.373
‐ You carry an excellent weapon.

00:12:00.373 --> 00:12:02.712
It's a shame
that it's in poor condition.

00:12:02.778 --> 00:12:03.714
‐ [growls]

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.784
‐ With such a dull blade edge,

00:12:05.818 --> 00:12:08.489
you haven't a chance
of laying even a scratch on me.

00:12:08.523 --> 00:12:09.892
‐ [yelps]

00:12:11.863 --> 00:12:13.466

00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:17.842
‐ Ah, now I remember.

00:12:17.875 --> 00:12:20.480
There is a way
to manifest your true strength.

00:12:20.514 --> 00:12:23.954
Your little sister
must be placed in mortal danger.

00:12:23.987 --> 00:12:25.891
Riku witnessed it himself.

00:12:25.891 --> 00:12:27.360
‐ [yelps]

00:12:27.394 --> 00:12:31.302

such a caring older sister.

I suppose I let my guard down.

00:12:43.225 --> 00:12:45.430
‐ I won't let you
lay a hand on her!

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:48.837
Riku, you left
a nice wound to exploit.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.808
I'll use it to my advantage!

Setsuna.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.116
No, you can't...

Towa, I'm so sorry.

00:13:50.594 --> 00:13:53.432
‐ It's OK. Don't say anything!

00:13:53.466 --> 00:13:56.405
I'm going
to patch you right up.

00:13:56.405 --> 00:14:01.248
<i>We were always together,</i>
<i>and we got along so well.</i>

00:14:01.248 --> 00:14:03.587
‐ Why are you crying, Towa?

00:14:03.587 --> 00:14:06.125
You're acting
as if I'm going to die.

00:14:06.158 --> 00:14:08.462
‐ Stop it!
That's not even funny!

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:10.734
‐ Don't worry.

00:14:10.768 --> 00:14:14.341
I'll be OK. I won't die.

00:14:14.408 --> 00:14:17.447
Not at a place
like this, anyway.

00:14:17.447 --> 00:14:18.950
It's just...

00:14:18.984 --> 00:14:19.952
‐ What is it?

00:14:19.986 --> 00:14:23.125
‐ I‐It's just that...

00:14:23.159 --> 00:14:26.365
I'm starting
to get a little sleepy.

00:14:38.355 --> 00:14:39.625
I think...

00:14:39.625 --> 00:14:43.165
I'm going to take a little nap.

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:45.136
[chimes ringing]

00:15:02.137 --> 00:15:03.974

00:15:23.145 --> 00:15:25.349
‐ What a shame this is.

00:15:25.349 --> 00:15:27.822
If only we had
Sesshomaru's Tenseiga.

00:15:27.855 --> 00:15:30.594
Then we could have
brought her back to life.

00:15:30.661 --> 00:15:32.197
‐ [crying]

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.201
‐ Unfortunately
this had to happen

00:15:34.234 --> 00:15:37.340
right after my older sister
Zero destroyed it.

00:15:37.373 --> 00:15:38.309
Huh?

00:15:44.689 --> 00:15:46.024
[Kirinmaru chuckles]

00:15:46.058 --> 00:15:48.663
So you've transformed yourself
into Beniyasha.

00:15:48.697 --> 00:15:51.168
Will you yet again
let yourself go wild

00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:52.671
as the Destroyer of Lands?

00:15:52.705 --> 00:15:54.407
‐ If that were the case,

00:15:54.441 --> 00:15:56.679
maybe you'd survive
for just a bit longer.

00:15:56.713 --> 00:15:57.681
‐ How so?

00:15:57.715 --> 00:16:00.052
‐ Things are different now.

00:16:00.086 --> 00:16:03.693
I've never felt so composed
after applying my rouge.

00:16:03.727 --> 00:16:05.229
Well, what do you know?

00:16:05.263 --> 00:16:08.235
I think I finally have control
of Beniyasha's true power.

00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:10.373
‐ [laughs]

00:16:14.849 --> 00:16:16.619

00:16:16.686 --> 00:16:18.723
you're going to die here.

00:16:24.869 --> 00:16:27.240
[chuckles] Yes, of course.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.810
This place
is where he lost his life.

00:16:28.877 --> 00:16:31.248
It all makes sense now.

00:16:31.248 --> 00:16:33.152
TOWA: Wait, Moroha.

00:16:33.219 --> 00:16:34.154

[animal growling]

00:16:37.227 --> 00:16:38.597
‐ That power. [grunts]

00:16:41.235 --> 00:16:44.307
‐ This is between me
and Kirinmaru.

00:16:44.374 --> 00:16:46.746
‐ He is mine alone to slay.
‐ [dragons growl]

00:16:46.779 --> 00:16:49.251
I will avenge Setsuna.

00:16:49.284 --> 00:16:50.587
Bastard.

00:16:50.587 --> 00:16:52.490
You took my Setsuna
away from me.

00:16:53.627 --> 00:16:56.599
I won't let you
get away with this.

00:16:56.633 --> 00:16:57.801
Kirinmaru!

00:16:57.835 --> 00:16:59.839
‐ I see.

00:16:59.906 --> 00:17:02.778
So that's what
your true power looks like.

00:17:02.778 --> 00:17:04.815
‐ I can't let you
have this one, Towa.

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:07.153
Setsuna was precious to me, too.

00:17:07.186 --> 00:17:09.257
I'll make him pay
for what he did.

00:17:09.291 --> 00:17:11.428
‐ [animal snarling]
‐ KIRINMARU: It matters not,

00:17:11.461 --> 00:17:13.800
for I am
the Beast King of the East,

00:17:13.833 --> 00:17:15.537
Kirinmaru of the Dawn.

00:17:15.604 --> 00:17:18.442
I'll take you both on
as my opponents.

00:17:18.442 --> 00:17:20.112
‐ If that's how you want it...

00:17:20.146 --> 00:17:21.783

limb from limb!

‐ Remember this well, Towa.

00:17:39.685 --> 00:17:42.323
Your attack,
the Azure Dragon Wave,

00:17:42.323 --> 00:17:44.160
was created by Sesshomaru,

00:17:44.194 --> 00:17:47.835
but you have made it your own
by giving the dragon twin heads.

00:17:47.868 --> 00:17:49.371
From this day forward,

00:17:49.437 --> 00:17:52.343
you shall call it
the Twin Azure Dragon Wave.

00:17:52.377 --> 00:17:53.680
And, Beniyasha...

00:17:53.713 --> 00:17:56.653
your Crimson Dragon Wave
is magnificent.

00:17:56.686 --> 00:17:59.859
This dragon will listen
to your will alone,

00:17:59.892 --> 00:18:03.365

no hope of pushing it away.

you're half‐demons,

00:18:43.847 --> 00:18:45.784
you're doing well
not to lose composure

00:18:45.851 --> 00:18:48.556

so much demon energy.

how you're always acting

00:18:56.506 --> 00:18:58.208

from taking Setsuna's life...

00:21:28.877 --> 00:21:31.047
‐ I haven't fought like that,

00:21:31.081 --> 00:21:34.522
not since my battle
with the Great Dog‐Demon.

00:21:34.555 --> 00:21:37.728
It would be a waste to let it
all end here with your deaths.

00:21:37.761 --> 00:21:39.932
‐ [gasping]
‐ Half‐Demon Princess...

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:43.540
I look forward to the next time
our paths may cross.

00:21:46.546 --> 00:21:48.550
Setsuna.

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:52.190
You have fought well
with great honor and dignity.

00:21:52.223 --> 00:21:54.595
I shall never forget that name.

00:22:13.498 --> 00:22:16.739
Oh, Setsuna. I'm sorry
we couldn't avenge you.

00:22:16.739 --> 00:22:18.643
‐ Setsuna.

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:20.647
Setsuna.

00:22:20.714 --> 00:22:23.586
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:22:23.586 --> 00:22:26.091
I'm so sorry, Setsuna.

00:22:26.091 --> 00:22:29.965
<i>This world is full</i>
<i>of weak people.</i>

00:22:29.999 --> 00:22:34.608
<i>But those who are truly weak</i>

00:22:34.642 --> 00:22:36.244
<i>are the ones</i>
<i>powerless to protect</i>

00:22:36.278 --> 00:22:38.650
<i>those they care about</i>
<i>when it matters the most.</i>

00:22:38.683 --> 00:22:40.754
[crying]

00:22:40.787 --> 00:22:42.156
<i>And that's‐‐</i>

00:22:42.189 --> 00:22:44.862
<i>that's exactly</i>
<i>the type of person I am.</i>

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:49.605
<i>How could I be so weak?</i>

00:22:50.807 --> 00:22:52.811

[no audible dialogue]

00:23:03.265 --> 00:23:05.135
Do what?

00:23:13.653 --> 00:23:16.024
‐ The choice is yours, Towa.
