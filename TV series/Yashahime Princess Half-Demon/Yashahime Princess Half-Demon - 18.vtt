TOWA: <i>Towa and Setsuna.</i>

<i>Between us half‐demon twins,</i>

00:00:10.655 --> 00:00:13.393

From the gate of surprise
on to the gate of death.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.503
‐ Calm down.

00:00:51.537 --> 00:00:53.273
You've got this, Towa.

00:00:57.816 --> 00:00:59.519
I smell Setsuna's blood.

00:01:00.622 --> 00:01:03.293

TOWA: Setsuna!

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:07.301
Can you hear me?!

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:08.771
‐ Over here!
‐ [footsteps crunching]

‐ Towa?
‐ Setsuna!

00:01:11.644 --> 00:01:13.380
‐ Why are you over there?

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.350
I haven't moved at all
from this spot.

00:01:15.384 --> 00:01:18.390
‐ It looks like Konton's spell
bends the space around us,

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.728
and it's been making us
walk around in circles!

00:01:21.864 --> 00:01:23.199
‐ She vanished.

00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:24.836
‐ It's a M Ã¶bius strip!

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.241
‐ A what?
‐ An infinite loop!

00:01:27.308 --> 00:01:29.345
If we aren't able
to escape it physically,

00:01:29.378 --> 00:01:32.552
we'll just have to go
and sever the circle itself!

00:01:32.585 --> 00:01:35.658
‐ Alright, but what exactly
should I be severing here?

00:01:35.692 --> 00:01:37.529
‐ It'd be a nexus of some kind,

00:01:37.562 --> 00:01:39.432
but I don't know
if we can see it!

00:01:41.202 --> 00:01:43.340
‐ We can if it's
a rift of demon energy.

00:01:43.373 --> 00:01:44.475
‐ How do you mean?

00:01:45.578 --> 00:01:47.348
‐ If I remember correctly,

00:01:47.381 --> 00:01:48.684
our clan has the ability

00:01:48.718 --> 00:01:51.824
to sniff out the location
of where demon energies clash

00:01:51.857 --> 00:01:53.661
and a technique
to cut through it.

00:01:53.694 --> 00:01:55.665
‐ Sniff it out, huh?

00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:57.267
‐ Let's attempt it.

00:02:00.273 --> 00:02:01.710
‐ Huh?

00:02:01.744 --> 00:02:03.547

[wind blows]

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.435
‐ This scent here...

00:02:14.435 --> 00:02:15.705
‐ It's Konton!

[both gasp]

00:02:32.572 --> 00:02:34.576
‐ He's close.
‐ Let's get him.

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:36.312
[both yell]

00:02:36.312 --> 00:02:37.414

00:02:38.483 --> 00:02:40.120
[grumbles]

00:02:43.728 --> 00:02:45.464
How dare you?

00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:46.900
Distasteful.

TOWA: <i>"Sesshomaru</i>

00:04:33.914 --> 00:04:35.985
Did you
just call us distasteful?

00:04:36.018 --> 00:04:37.755
You're the one
who trapped us in there!

00:04:37.822 --> 00:04:39.893
Now where's Kirinmaru?

00:04:39.926 --> 00:04:43.433
‐ And what business would
you have with Lord Kirinmaru?

00:04:43.501 --> 00:04:45.571
‐ I'm searching
for the Dream Butterfly.

00:04:45.605 --> 00:04:47.609
‐ The Dream Butterfly, you say?

00:04:47.675 --> 00:04:49.846
[laughs]

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.783
[wind whipping]

00:04:54.088 --> 00:04:56.527

00:05:02.672 --> 00:05:05.410
‐ Oi. What the hell?

00:05:05.443 --> 00:05:07.849
‐ Totetsu? Is that really you?

00:05:07.882 --> 00:05:10.521
‐ Huh? I get it now.

00:05:10.555 --> 00:05:13.359
I'm betting that Konton
messed something up.

00:05:13.393 --> 00:05:15.965
Oh, well. Might as well
slice you up while I'm here.

00:05:16.032 --> 00:05:18.938
‐ [grunts] Will be hard
to do that without your head!

00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:20.975
‐ [yells]

00:05:21.042 --> 00:05:22.946

[both gasp]

00:05:31.095 --> 00:05:32.899
‐ Eh? Oh, no.

00:05:32.932 --> 00:05:35.303
Something terrible
must have happened in there.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.573
‐ Indeed.

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:38.811
‐ Eh?

00:05:38.811 --> 00:05:40.748
Lord Riku?

00:05:40.781 --> 00:05:42.819

00:05:45.925 --> 00:05:49.599
I'd‐‐I'd honestly
just rather go home.

TOWA: What are you laughing at?

00:05:53.507 --> 00:05:55.143
‐ From my vantage point,

00:05:55.176 --> 00:05:58.016
it appears you two have no idea
what it is you're doing.

00:05:58.016 --> 00:06:00.086
‐ What? Explain yourself now!

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.523
‐ Very well.

00:06:01.523 --> 00:06:04.028
The two of you have been
chasing the Dream Butterfly,

00:06:04.094 --> 00:06:06.533
despite the fact
you don't comprehend

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:08.069
our Master's design for it.

00:06:08.102 --> 00:06:10.006
‐ Why would we care about that?

00:06:10.006 --> 00:06:12.812
If Kirinmaru is connected
to the Dream Butterfly,

00:06:12.845 --> 00:06:15.518
that just means I'll get
Setsuna's dreams back from him.

00:06:15.585 --> 00:06:16.853
‐ Oh, my.

00:06:16.853 --> 00:06:19.759
You half‐demons
truly are ignorant.

00:06:19.793 --> 00:06:20.861

00:06:51.556 --> 00:06:53.894
‐ I didn't wanna do this,

00:06:53.961 --> 00:06:56.566
but I definitely
don't want Lord Kirinmaru

00:06:56.566 --> 00:06:58.671
to be angry with me, either.

00:06:58.704 --> 00:07:01.910
Ecch. this'll taste terrible,
but, oh, well.

00:07:03.246 --> 00:07:04.649
[sighs]

‐ [Konton laughs]
‐ [both gasp]

00:07:28.998 --> 00:07:31.770
‐ You each possess
a Rainbow Pearl,

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.776
yet you likely
don't even know their origins.

00:07:34.776 --> 00:07:36.947
‐ And what else is there
to know about them?

00:07:37.014 --> 00:07:40.253
‐ The seven combined form
a power that should not exist,

00:07:40.286 --> 00:07:43.694
so Lady Zero scattered them
across the lands.

00:07:43.727 --> 00:07:47.467
Both of you possessing one will
bring about nothing but ruin.

00:07:47.535 --> 00:07:49.438
I must put a stop to this now.

00:07:49.506 --> 00:07:50.841

This creature is like a puppet.

00:08:13.587 --> 00:08:15.991
‐ Then we just have
to take out the puppeteer.

00:08:16.058 --> 00:08:17.562

‐ [groans]

00:11:02.959 --> 00:11:05.063
‐ Is it OK we left Riku behind?

00:11:05.096 --> 00:11:07.334
We can't worry
about that right now.

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:09.037
Oh, yeah, by the way,

00:11:09.071 --> 00:11:11.108
you two defeated Konton,
didn't you?

00:11:11.141 --> 00:11:13.246
Did you happen
to snatch his head for me?

00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:15.383
‐ There was no head.
It was devoured.

00:11:15.416 --> 00:11:16.720
‐ For real?!

00:11:16.753 --> 00:11:19.057

the time to worry about that?

Is he planning
to escape to the seas?

00:11:35.423 --> 00:11:37.828
‐ He's the only one
of the Four Perils left.

00:11:37.862 --> 00:11:39.799
He's probably
running to his superior,

00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:41.870
Kirinmaru, for assistance.

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:42.972
‐ Superior?

00:11:43.005 --> 00:11:44.341
‐ Someone above his rank.

00:11:44.341 --> 00:11:46.412
‐ Then that'd be the boss,
wouldn't it?

00:11:46.445 --> 00:11:47.915
How much money do you think

00:11:47.949 --> 00:11:50.286
a boss demon like Kirinmaru
is worth, huh?

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.925
‐ Eh, those little brats.

00:11:52.959 --> 00:11:54.027

‐ [groans]

00:12:02.444 --> 00:12:06.385

these uninvited guests?

00:12:06.385 --> 00:12:09.157
‐ Eh, I'm terribly sorry,
Master.

00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:11.395
‐ Begone.
‐ [whimpers]

00:12:11.462 --> 00:12:14.067

you're running off to?

‐ Oh, really?

00:12:51.977 --> 00:12:55.149
So you're the big boss man
of the Four Perils!

00:12:55.183 --> 00:12:56.920
I hope you're ready for us!

00:12:56.987 --> 00:12:58.255
‐ Moroha, wait.

00:12:58.322 --> 00:13:01.261
You're the one controlling
the Dream Butterfly, right?

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:05.871
If it's true
you've stolen Setsuna's dreams,

00:13:05.904 --> 00:13:07.340
please return them.

00:13:07.374 --> 00:13:10.179
‐ Hey, why don't we
just take 'em back by force?

00:13:10.213 --> 00:13:12.384
But I get dibs
on his severed head.

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:14.555
‐ Is there even
a bounty for Kirinmaru?

00:13:14.589 --> 00:13:16.091
‐ Huh?

00:13:16.125 --> 00:13:17.093
Takechiyo!

00:13:17.127 --> 00:13:18.530
‐ Yeah, what is it?

00:13:18.563 --> 00:13:20.199
‐ You'd know the answer, right?

00:13:20.233 --> 00:13:23.172
‐ I don't recall anyone
putting a bounty out for him.

00:13:23.205 --> 00:13:26.412
‐ And the Tree of Ages never
promised us a reward, either.

00:13:26.445 --> 00:13:27.882
‐ Mm...

00:13:27.915 --> 00:13:29.217
I'll sit this out then.

00:13:29.251 --> 00:13:31.121

We still need to settle

00:13:31.188 --> 00:13:32.858

with the Dream Butterfly.

‐ Listen well, half‐demons.

00:13:36.298 --> 00:13:40.541
If you seek my head, then I
suggest you try and claim it.

MOROHA: I'd rather
not work for free, thank you.

00:13:43.045 --> 00:13:44.214

00:13:44.214 --> 00:13:46.418
the Dream Butterfly
will disappear.

00:13:46.452 --> 00:13:48.590

could you make it disappear

00:13:48.623 --> 00:13:50.493

There exists a prophecy
that half‐demons

00:13:56.372 --> 00:13:58.977
will be responsible
for my demise.

00:13:59.044 --> 00:14:01.382
For this reason,
I must investigate

00:14:01.415 --> 00:14:05.089
whether this is true or false
to lay my mind at ease.

are not meant to exist
in this world at all.

half‐demon that.

00:14:14.575 --> 00:14:16.245

you have.

‐ You wanna see some flair?

00:14:28.135 --> 00:14:29.137
Fine then!

taking all of it.

aren't enough for me.

‐ Remember what we did
earlier, Towa.

Let's cut off
the flow of demon energy.

be sensed by the likes of you.

Your mind, body, and skill
are all weak.

00:15:21.543 --> 00:15:23.747
Was the prophecy false?

00:15:23.814 --> 00:15:26.151
Or perhaps
the fact of the matter

00:15:26.151 --> 00:15:28.189
is that you are
not the true half‐demons

00:15:28.222 --> 00:15:30.493

to take my life after all.

00:20:45.557 --> 00:20:46.626
Moroha?

00:20:46.626 --> 00:20:48.630
‐ Good. You're OK, too.

00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:52.370
So what exactly happened here?

00:20:52.403 --> 00:20:54.909
Did you two manage
to defeat Kirinmaru?

00:20:54.975 --> 00:20:55.911
SETSUNA: No.

00:20:55.977 --> 00:20:57.648
‐ You're not gonna believe this!

00:20:57.648 --> 00:20:59.752
It was Sesshomaru!
He showed up!

00:20:59.819 --> 00:21:01.321
‐ Sesshomaru did?

00:21:01.354 --> 00:21:03.358
Wait, as in your dad?

00:21:03.392 --> 00:21:04.427
What happened?

00:21:04.494 --> 00:21:05.730
‐ I don't know.

00:21:05.764 --> 00:21:09.505
But it looks like he has
some connection with Kirinmaru.

00:21:09.538 --> 00:21:10.874
‐ [sighs]

00:21:10.907 --> 00:21:12.811
[violin playing]

00:21:22.865 --> 00:21:24.835
Hey, show yourself, damn it!

00:21:24.869 --> 00:21:27.541
Why don't you actually help us?!

00:21:27.574 --> 00:21:29.912
Come on!
Say something, will you?!

00:21:31.381 --> 00:21:32.784
[groans]

00:21:32.851 --> 00:21:35.456
There's really not much
we can do right now, is there?

00:21:35.524 --> 00:21:36.859
‐ Yeah.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.897
TOWA: <i>Sesshomaru...</i>

00:21:55.931 --> 00:21:58.368
<i>what is it that he's</i>
<i>trying to accomplish?</i>

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:09.892
[violin music ends]

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:14.334
[Japanese music playing]

00:23:44.247 --> 00:23:45.717
‐ Demon slayers!

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:48.055
It was me, Princess Aiya,
who summoned you!

00:23:48.088 --> 00:23:49.758
SETSUNA: Hisui has
accepted a match

00:23:49.825 --> 00:23:52.229
between the demon slayers
and the bounty hunters.

00:23:52.263 --> 00:23:53.766
But don't tell Towa.

00:23:53.833 --> 00:23:55.870
MOROHA: Aren't they going
a little too far with this?

00:23:55.904 --> 00:23:58.576
TOWA: Why are Moroha and
Setsuna fighting each other?

00:23:58.643 --> 00:24:00.045
SETSUNA: I accepted this job,

00:24:00.079 --> 00:24:02.249
so I will see it through
and claim victory.

00:24:02.316 --> 00:24:03.820
TOWA: Next time on Yashahime,

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.824
<i>"Princess Aiya's</i>
<i>Beniyasha Hunting."</i>

00:24:05.824 --> 00:24:07.694
SETSUNA: Towa,
if you get in my way,

00:24:07.728 --> 00:24:09.197
I will have
to defeat you, too!
