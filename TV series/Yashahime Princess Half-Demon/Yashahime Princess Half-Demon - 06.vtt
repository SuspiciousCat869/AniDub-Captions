Only ten?

it's not even worth that much.

about the Dream Butterfly,

‐ I don't, not really. How come?

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:50.851
‐ My sister here had her dreams
stolen by the butterfly.

I mean, she said her parents

You can call me Juan.

If this were the Modern Era,
he'd totally be a celebrity.

00:08:46.126 --> 00:08:49.095
Wait. Do you think
he could be Julian's ancestor?

00:08:49.129 --> 00:08:50.096

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.698

00:08:51.765 --> 00:08:53.133
Now give it a rest.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:56.803

So there are ghost cats
in the mountain.

00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:05.111
I must admit this is the first
I've heard of it, I'm afraid.

00:09:05.178 --> 00:09:07.280

anything strange?

00:09:07.347 --> 00:09:08.782
‐ Such as?

00:09:08.849 --> 00:09:10.784
‐ A lot of people
have gone missing lately

00:09:10.851 --> 00:09:13.019
all of which were traveling
through the mountain pass.

00:09:13.119 --> 00:09:15.656
‐ I have offered many travelers
shelter for the night

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:18.324
in the temple,
but nothing out of the ordinary.

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.126

00:09:20.193 --> 00:09:22.395
‐ It is getting late.
The three of you are welcome

00:09:22.462 --> 00:09:24.464
to stay until morning
if you would like to.

00:09:24.497 --> 00:09:26.032
It might be wise.

00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:28.134
The mountain pass can be
quite dangerous after dark.

00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:29.670
‐ Sure, why not?

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:32.138
‐ We'll take you up on that.
‐ [both grunt]

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:36.476
‐ Alright.
Make yourselves at home.

00:09:38.812 --> 00:09:40.413
TOWA: Do you think
the ghost cats

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.348
might be hiding
somewhere in the mountain?

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:44.250
‐ No. They're here.

00:09:44.317 --> 00:09:46.252
‐ What? Here?
‐ Obviously.

00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:48.254
The whole temple
smells like demons.

00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:50.356
‐ You mean Julian is one, too?

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:54.728
‐ Not him. That monk smells
100% human through and through.

00:09:54.828 --> 00:09:57.030
Towa, better hurry up
and learn how to smell demons,

00:09:57.097 --> 00:09:58.364
or you're gonna be in trouble.

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.834
And stop calling him Julian.

00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:02.368
[yelps] Uh...

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:04.270
What's this music?

00:10:04.337 --> 00:10:06.006
‐ It's one of Julian's songs.

00:10:06.072 --> 00:10:07.340
‐ Mm, mm.

00:10:07.407 --> 00:10:09.876
Wow, this guy really sucks.

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:11.845
‐ [laughs]
‐ Eh?

00:10:13.213 --> 00:10:14.515
‐ Eh?

00:10:14.548 --> 00:10:15.749
Uh...

00:10:15.849 --> 00:10:18.885
‐ Now, how do we
handle the cats?

00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:20.386
‐ If we let ourselves
appear defenseless,

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:23.023
I'm sure they'll
just come to us at some point.

00:10:23.056 --> 00:10:24.791
‐ The basics of a demon slayer.

00:10:24.858 --> 00:10:26.092
‐ It's new to me.

00:10:26.192 --> 00:10:27.260
You're right.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.195
I better hurry up
and get used to it,

00:10:29.229 --> 00:10:30.897
or I won't be able
to help anyone.

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:32.065
‐ What do you mean, "help"?

00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:33.099
‐ It's what we do.

00:10:33.199 --> 00:10:34.901
‐ No, we slay demons.

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:37.137
‐ But we helped in the village.

00:10:37.203 --> 00:10:39.039
‐ That was just a detour.

00:10:39.072 --> 00:10:41.041
And those ghost cats
are worthless.

00:10:41.074 --> 00:10:43.910
We gotta aim higher
if we wanna get paid.

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:44.945
[blanket rustles]

00:10:45.045 --> 00:10:46.379
Moroha, why do
you want to make

00:10:46.446 --> 00:10:48.549
‐ so much money, anyway?
‐ Huh?

00:10:48.582 --> 00:10:51.317
I just haven't noticed you
spending any of it.

00:10:51.384 --> 00:10:54.220
‐ OK, time for me
to pretend I'm sleeping.

00:10:54.287 --> 00:10:55.221
‐ Hey.

00:10:55.288 --> 00:10:57.123
‐ Come on. You guys, too.

00:10:57.223 --> 00:10:58.391
‐ She's right.

00:10:58.424 --> 00:11:00.226
Maybe we should
make our beds now.

00:11:00.293 --> 00:11:02.328
‐ I don't sleep, remember?

00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:04.064
‐ Oh, yeah.

00:11:04.097 --> 00:11:06.066
[suspenseful music playing]

00:11:18.144 --> 00:11:20.346
‐ Towa, quiet your energy.

00:11:20.413 --> 00:11:22.082
‐ Huh? Sorry.

00:11:22.148 --> 00:11:23.349
[energy pulsing]

00:11:23.416 --> 00:11:24.918
‐ Never mind.

00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:27.087
It doesn't matter
at this point, anyway.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.855
‐ [soft meowing]

00:11:28.922 --> 00:11:30.456
[shrieking]

00:11:30.524 --> 00:11:34.828
‐ I knew you stupid ghost cats
would fall right into our trap!

00:11:35.929 --> 00:11:37.097
Take this!

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:39.199
‐ [squealing]

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.135
‐ Towa, behind you!
‐ [gasps]

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:43.436
‐ [shrieking]
‐ [grunts]

00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:47.340
[cats groan]

00:11:49.643 --> 00:11:51.277
‐ I told you two
this would work.

00:11:51.311 --> 00:11:53.113
‐ [running footsteps]
‐ Hmm?

00:11:53.179 --> 00:11:55.115
‐ What was all that noise?

00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:57.283
[gasps] What happened here?

00:11:57.317 --> 00:12:00.554
‐ Hey, Mr. Monk, you didn't
notice all these ghost cats?

00:12:00.621 --> 00:12:02.523
‐ I didn't.

00:12:02.623 --> 00:12:04.457
‐ But the question
still remains.

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:07.027
Why are they nested
in this specific temple?

00:12:07.127 --> 00:12:10.130
‐ I think
that my insufficient training

00:12:10.196 --> 00:12:12.332
kept me from detecting them.

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:13.967
However...

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.870
the truth is
there is a very old legend

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.338
that surrounds this temple.

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:21.474
About 100 years ago,

00:12:21.508 --> 00:12:24.477
there was a powerful priest
who sealed a demon away.

00:12:24.511 --> 00:12:26.346
He laid its corpse to rest

00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:28.248
beneath the floors
of this temple.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:31.317
‐ Under the floors?

00:12:31.351 --> 00:12:32.553
‐ It's your call, Towa.

00:12:32.653 --> 00:12:34.487
You did want to help people,
didn't you?

00:12:34.521 --> 00:12:37.023
‐ Yeah. Let's investigate.

00:12:41.361 --> 00:12:43.496
MOROHA: Are you sure
it's actually down here?

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.365
It's pitch‐black in there.

00:12:45.398 --> 00:12:47.033
‐ We can't proceed
without light.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.502
‐ [gasps] Hang on a sec.

00:12:48.535 --> 00:12:49.503
‐ Hmm?
‐ Huh?

00:12:49.536 --> 00:12:51.271
‐ Here you go.

00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:53.039
‐ Oh, yeah.
That'll do the trick!

00:12:53.073 --> 00:12:54.074
‐ [chuckles]
‐ [yelps]

00:12:54.174 --> 00:12:55.542
What do you think you're doing?

00:12:55.576 --> 00:12:56.677
Cut it out, would you?

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.712
‐ [groans]
‐ Honestly...

00:12:58.745 --> 00:13:00.080
Ooh!

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.248
I gotta admit
this thing is handy.

00:13:06.553 --> 00:13:08.254
I just put up a barrier.

00:13:08.354 --> 00:13:11.725
In theory, this should prevent
demons from entering the temple.

00:13:11.758 --> 00:13:14.695
‐ Don't worry, Juan.
I'll make sure to protect you.

00:13:16.062 --> 00:13:17.531
‐ Thank you very much.

00:13:17.564 --> 00:13:19.633
That is quite reassuring.

00:13:20.767 --> 00:13:23.036
MOROHA: Towa's such a cheater!

00:13:23.069 --> 00:13:24.738
"Let's go investigate,"
she says,

00:13:24.771 --> 00:13:27.541
but we're the ones who are
down here doing the dirty work.

00:13:27.574 --> 00:13:28.742
[gasps]

00:13:28.775 --> 00:13:30.544
Hey, look. A hole.

00:13:30.577 --> 00:13:32.546
[dramatic music playing]

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:36.750
Ghost cat bones?

00:13:36.783 --> 00:13:39.586
‐ Looks like the legend
the monk told us was true.

00:13:39.653 --> 00:13:41.221
‐ There's something
weird about it.

00:13:41.254 --> 00:13:42.723
‐ [creaking]
‐ [both gasp]

00:13:47.293 --> 00:13:48.328
[both gasp]

00:13:48.428 --> 00:13:50.330
[rumbling]

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.298
‐ What's happening?

00:13:52.398 --> 00:13:53.567
‐ Could it be...

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.436
‐ MOROHA: Damn it.
‐ [roaring]

00:13:56.469 --> 00:13:58.138
‐ Let's hit it together, Setsu!

00:13:58.238 --> 00:14:00.774
Crimson Dragon Wave!

00:14:00.807 --> 00:14:02.142
[dragon roars]

00:14:03.243 --> 00:14:06.146
[demon cat growls]

00:14:06.246 --> 00:14:08.014
‐ Cyclone Burst!

00:14:10.617 --> 00:14:11.785
‐ We did it!

00:14:11.818 --> 00:14:12.786
Nice‐‐Uh...

00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:14.087
‐ What the...

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.522
It's reforming.

00:14:15.622 --> 00:14:17.457
‐ Something funny's going on.

00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:20.460
These bones don't smell
the same as the ghost cats.

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:22.596
‐ Setsuna! Moroha!

00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:24.665
‐ Your friends,
will they be alright?

00:14:24.765 --> 00:14:28.101
‐ If I know those two,
they'll be just fine.

00:14:28.134 --> 00:14:30.370
‐ We've seen warriors like them.

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:32.639
They, too, had come
to slay the cats here,

00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:34.775
but failed
and ended up being eaten.

00:14:34.808 --> 00:14:36.643
What utter fools they were.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.812
‐ [gasps]

00:14:38.845 --> 00:14:41.815
‐ You three
will share their fate.

00:14:41.848 --> 00:14:44.618
‐ What are you?

00:14:44.651 --> 00:14:47.120
‐ Let's see
how you fare against this!

00:14:47.153 --> 00:14:48.488
‐ [snarls]

00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:49.823
‐ [gasps]

00:14:49.856 --> 00:14:51.658
‐ [shrieks]

00:14:51.725 --> 00:14:53.393
MOROHA: Those are human bones.

00:14:53.493 --> 00:14:54.728
‐ Most likely, those bones

00:14:54.828 --> 00:14:56.697
belong to the victims
it's devoured.

00:14:56.797 --> 00:14:59.833
Someone near this temple
is controlling them.

00:14:59.866 --> 00:15:03.203
‐ But the only other person here
right now is that monk.

00:15:03.303 --> 00:15:04.838
‐ [snarls]

00:15:04.871 --> 00:15:08.842
‐ I will devour you, so you
might as well give up now.

00:15:08.875 --> 00:15:10.243
‐ Let me guess.

00:15:10.343 --> 00:15:12.513
You're the leader
of the ghost cats.

00:15:13.647 --> 00:15:14.815
‐ [energy crackles]
‐ [gasps]

00:15:14.848 --> 00:15:17.183
‐ I did say
that I put up a barrier.

00:15:18.218 --> 00:15:19.586
[laughs]

00:15:19.686 --> 00:15:21.755
Except it's not made
with Buddhist power,

00:15:21.855 --> 00:15:23.356
but with demon power.

00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:25.491
‐ Setsuna! Moroha!

00:15:25.526 --> 00:15:27.193
‐ They can't hear you.

00:15:27.227 --> 00:15:28.529
Those two are busy

00:15:28.562 --> 00:15:31.197
fighting with the ghost cat
under my control.

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:33.066
None of you
are leaving this temple.

00:15:33.166 --> 00:15:34.768
I will feast upon you
as you die!

00:15:34.868 --> 00:15:37.704
‐ Then I'll just
have to take you down myself!

00:15:37.738 --> 00:15:39.405
‐ Don't make me laugh.

00:15:39.506 --> 00:15:42.208
I have lived here
for over three centuries now.

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:44.545
You really think
you can defeat me?

00:15:44.578 --> 00:15:45.546
Get her.

00:15:45.579 --> 00:15:47.113
‐ [shrieking]

00:15:47.213 --> 00:15:48.715
‐ [gasps]

00:15:48.749 --> 00:15:50.216
‐ [groans]

00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:51.351
‐ [hissing]

00:15:51.384 --> 00:15:52.619
‐ No matter
how many ghost cats‐‐

00:15:52.719 --> 00:15:54.187
‐ JUAN: Help me.
‐ [gasps]

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.189
‐ Please, you have to help me.

00:15:56.222 --> 00:15:58.759
‐ Wait. But I thought
you were a demon.

00:15:58.859 --> 00:16:00.426
‐ No, I'm‐‐

00:16:00.527 --> 00:16:02.262
[groans]

00:16:02.362 --> 00:16:03.730
None of this matters.

00:16:03.797 --> 00:16:05.766
I will feast on your flesh.

00:16:05.866 --> 00:16:07.200
‐ [hissing]

00:16:07.233 --> 00:16:08.368
‐ [gasps]

00:16:10.571 --> 00:16:12.739
‐ [grunts] Not again.

00:16:12.773 --> 00:16:14.240
‐ [snarls]

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:16.610
‐ This cat's got
way more than nine lives.

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:18.378
‐ Moroha, handle things here.

00:16:18.411 --> 00:16:20.747
‐ Hey, where are you...
‐ [shrieks]

00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:23.750
‐ Towa!

00:16:23.817 --> 00:16:25.251
A barrier?

00:16:25.285 --> 00:16:26.653
Is it the apparition's spell?

00:16:26.753 --> 00:16:28.388
‐ Clear the way, Setsuna!
‐ [gasps]

00:16:28.421 --> 00:16:30.223
‐ I'll use my Sacred Arrow

00:16:30.256 --> 00:16:31.625
to break through that barrier!

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:37.163
‐ What?! My barrier!

00:16:37.263 --> 00:16:39.165
‐ Setsuna.

00:16:39.265 --> 00:16:40.767
‐ Before,
you only smelled of human,

00:16:40.801 --> 00:16:42.903
but no longer. Explain.

00:16:42.936 --> 00:16:46.139
‐ [laughs]
For the last 100 years,

00:16:46.239 --> 00:16:49.142
I had been sealed beneath
the floors of this temple,

00:16:49.242 --> 00:16:50.511
until just recently,

00:16:50.611 --> 00:16:52.613
when this pathetic
excuse of a monk

00:16:52.646 --> 00:16:54.915
thought he should
hold a service for me.

00:16:54.948 --> 00:16:57.618
The sutra he chanted
out of compassion

00:16:57.651 --> 00:17:01.487
was strong enough
to awaken my ensnared soul.

00:17:01.588 --> 00:17:03.790
And that's when I
broke through the seal,

00:17:03.824 --> 00:17:05.291
making it child's play

00:17:05.325 --> 00:17:07.427
to take control
of the monk's body.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.630
‐ He was only trying
to save you.

00:17:09.663 --> 00:17:10.931
‐ [laughs]

00:17:10.964 --> 00:17:13.299
I was never seeking salvation.

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:15.368
‐ I've heard more than enough
of your story.

00:17:15.468 --> 00:17:16.469
Prepare to die.

00:17:16.537 --> 00:17:17.804
‐ Hang on, Setsuna.

00:17:17.838 --> 00:17:19.172
Juan's still in there.

00:17:19.272 --> 00:17:20.841
We have to free him
from the ghost cat!

00:17:20.941 --> 00:17:22.709
‐ [laughs]

00:17:22.809 --> 00:17:24.845
The monk has been
a useful disguise,

00:17:24.945 --> 00:17:28.181
so I've allowed him to live,
but I may change my mind.

00:17:28.281 --> 00:17:29.482
So what will you do,

00:17:29.516 --> 00:17:30.884
cut down the monk
along with me?

00:17:30.984 --> 00:17:32.318
‐ [gasps]

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:34.320
‐ [yells]
‐ [yelps]

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:35.321
‐ Is that...

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:36.723
a cat's paw?

00:17:36.823 --> 00:17:38.725
‐ [groans]

00:17:38.825 --> 00:17:40.527
‐ So that's your main body.

00:17:40.627 --> 00:17:42.495
There's a smell
coming from your belly

00:17:42.563 --> 00:17:45.866
that wasn't there when you
were disguised as a human.

00:17:45.966 --> 00:17:48.969
‐ And why should that
matter to me?

00:17:49.002 --> 00:17:51.538
[growling]

00:17:51.638 --> 00:17:53.674
‐ Oh, no.
‐ [gasps]

00:17:53.707 --> 00:17:56.376
‐ [laughs] Go ahead,
and split me in two

00:17:56.476 --> 00:17:58.512
along with the monk
if you dare!

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.414
‐ Whaah! Come on!

00:18:01.515 --> 00:18:03.517
What are you tryin' to do,
kill somebody?

00:18:03.584 --> 00:18:04.818
I'm on my own out here!

00:18:04.851 --> 00:18:05.886
‐ [snarls]
‐ [yelps]

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.589
‐ If that's how you feel,

00:18:08.689 --> 00:18:09.723
then I won't hold back.

00:18:09.823 --> 00:18:11.658
‐ You can't. Setsuna, please!

00:18:11.692 --> 00:18:12.893
‐ What is it now?

00:18:12.993 --> 00:18:14.928
‐ Apparition or not,
that's still Juan!

00:18:15.028 --> 00:18:16.763
‐ We can't kill it otherwise.

00:18:16.863 --> 00:18:17.931
Setsuna!

00:18:18.031 --> 00:18:19.933
‐ Why don't you
try it then, Towa?

00:18:20.033 --> 00:18:22.703
Go ahead, and see if you
can cut down the ghost cat

00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:23.870
without hurting the monk.

00:18:23.904 --> 00:18:26.439
‐ But I‐‐
‐ MOROHA: Hurry up, Towa!

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:27.941
‐ [snarls]

00:18:28.041 --> 00:18:29.442
‐ Figure something out!

00:18:29.543 --> 00:18:31.612
Otherwise,
you're gonna have to kill him!

00:18:31.712 --> 00:18:33.547
MYOGA: Speaking of
whether one can or can't,

00:18:33.614 --> 00:18:36.049
Master Inuyasha
was able to spare opponents.

00:18:36.082 --> 00:18:37.784
‐ What in the hell
are you blabbering about

00:18:37.884 --> 00:18:39.252
at a time like this?

00:18:39.352 --> 00:18:41.454
‐ Master Inuyasha's weapon,
the Tessaiga

00:18:41.555 --> 00:18:43.456
could absorb
his foe's demon power

00:18:43.557 --> 00:18:45.025
and leave everything else alone.

00:18:45.058 --> 00:18:48.028
‐ The Tessaiga? It can't help
if we don't have it.

00:18:48.061 --> 00:18:49.262
‐ [shrieks]

00:18:49.362 --> 00:18:50.697
‐ None of us know how

00:18:50.731 --> 00:18:53.266
to absorb demon power
without hurting somebody!

00:18:53.366 --> 00:18:55.736
‐ Absorbing
only the demon power.

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:56.737
That's it.

00:18:58.404 --> 00:19:00.440
Like with Root Head...

00:19:00.541 --> 00:19:03.409
‐ I won't let you
cut me down so easily.

00:19:03.443 --> 00:19:04.978
‐ We have no other choice.

00:19:05.078 --> 00:19:07.581
‐ Wait, Setsuna.
Don't kill Juan.

00:19:07.614 --> 00:19:08.715
‐ If he doesn't die,

00:19:08.749 --> 00:19:10.416
‐ then we will!
‐ [gasps]

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.919
‐ How long are you
gonna drag that era with you?

00:19:12.953 --> 00:19:15.321
Your life is at stake
here and now.

00:19:15.421 --> 00:19:17.290
Sever those ideals
along with the ghost cat!

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:18.424
‐ I can't do that!

00:19:18.458 --> 00:19:19.593
‐ What?

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:21.094
‐ Setsuna, you had a taste

00:19:21.127 --> 00:19:22.929
of what it's like there,
remember,

00:19:22.963 --> 00:19:26.633
how peaceful it was,
and everyone there.

00:19:27.768 --> 00:19:28.669
‐ [sighs]

00:19:31.404 --> 00:19:34.340
‐ Listen, after I
return your dreams to you,

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.776
I'm going back,

00:19:35.809 --> 00:19:37.911
because I made
a promise to Mei.

00:19:39.445 --> 00:19:40.747
And that's why...

00:19:40.781 --> 00:19:42.516
I'm fine risking my life...

00:19:42.616 --> 00:19:45.318
but I won't take
the lives of others.

00:19:46.419 --> 00:19:48.121
‐ Pathetic! [growls]

00:19:49.155 --> 00:19:50.123
‐ Towa!

00:19:53.126 --> 00:19:54.795
‐ Hang on, Juan.

00:19:54.828 --> 00:19:56.496
I'm going to save you!

She's absorbing
its demon power?!

There's just no end
to this damn thing.

00:20:22.488 --> 00:20:23.557
Wait. What?

00:20:23.657 --> 00:20:25.859
‐ Boing!
It looks as though Lady Towa

00:20:25.959 --> 00:20:28.695
has stolen away
the ghost cat's demon power.

00:20:34.167 --> 00:20:36.570
‐ Oh, man. Does that mean
she killed the monk, too?

00:20:41.508 --> 00:20:43.844
MYOGA: Oh!
Just as one would expect

00:20:43.877 --> 00:20:45.979
from the daughter
of Lord Sesshomaru.

00:20:46.012 --> 00:20:49.516
‐ Hah! She'd have to be
way more coldhearted for that.

00:20:52.886 --> 00:20:56.056
‐ Your naiveté might very well
be your downfall someday.

00:20:56.156 --> 00:20:58.024
Don't count
on getting this lucky again.

00:20:58.091 --> 00:21:00.493
‐ Don't worry. I told you.

00:21:00.527 --> 00:21:02.863
I won't die
until we get your dreams back,

00:21:02.929 --> 00:21:04.430
and that's a promise.

‐ May you all rest in peace.

00:21:26.086 --> 00:21:30.557
This disaster was all because of
my pride and lack of experience.

00:21:30.591 --> 00:21:33.527
I know I'm not powerful enough
to be a priest.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.129
Returning to secular life
is the best choice for me.

00:21:36.229 --> 00:21:37.864
‐ Good. I hope you'll go home

00:21:37.898 --> 00:21:39.866
and become
the proud ancestor of Julian.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.635
‐ Become the what?

00:21:41.735 --> 00:21:43.770
‐ Why are you
spouting nonsense again?

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:46.039
‐ There's no need to be grumpy.

00:21:46.072 --> 00:21:49.743
We did the job. Now it's time
for us to get paid!

00:21:49.776 --> 00:21:51.077
Whaah?!

00:21:51.111 --> 00:21:52.746
What did you say?!

00:21:52.779 --> 00:21:54.047
‐ 15 mon.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.549
‐ But why, though?

00:21:55.582 --> 00:21:56.783
Well, it didn't sound

00:21:56.883 --> 00:21:58.552
like he gave you
very much trouble.

00:21:58.585 --> 00:22:00.120
‐ We did the job
without killing the monk,

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.555
which was a total pain!

00:22:01.588 --> 00:22:04.157
‐ That sounds a lot
like a you problem.

00:22:04.257 --> 00:22:06.560
‐ Then stop wasting our time
on these small fries,

00:22:06.593 --> 00:22:09.930
and give us jobs that'll make us
some real money, already!
