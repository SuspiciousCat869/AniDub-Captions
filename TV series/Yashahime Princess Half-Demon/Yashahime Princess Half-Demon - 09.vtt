They suspect that demons might

‐ No way! It's the whole reason
I'm here in the first place.

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:08.975
I'm getting your dreams and
memories back, and that's final.

00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:11.812
‐ As usual, I got nothing.
‐ Not at all?

00:05:11.878 --> 00:05:15.115
‐ Sorry. But if you're
really looking for results,

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:17.050
maybe you should try
putting a bounty on it.

someone to go looking for it.

a bounty you need done

that kind of money?

I just thought that,

that's responsible
for destroying the fortress?

‐ Slay him, obviously.

00:09:40.814 --> 00:09:41.748
‐ Watch out!

00:09:41.815 --> 00:09:43.049
‐ [growls]
‐ [all gasp]

00:09:44.685 --> 00:09:47.754
[both snarling]

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:49.189
‐ [grunts]

00:09:50.323 --> 00:09:53.026
Half‐demons. I won't hold back.

00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:53.927
‐ [growls]

00:09:55.195 --> 00:09:56.262
‐ [grunting]

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:01.835
‐ [gasps]

00:10:01.868 --> 00:10:03.003
‐ [yells]

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.209
You can't parry
like that forever, you know.

00:10:09.242 --> 00:10:10.276
Your belly's...

00:10:10.343 --> 00:10:12.112
wide open.

00:10:12.178 --> 00:10:13.279
What the...

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:15.081
‐ [yelps]
‐ Moroha!

00:10:16.683 --> 00:10:19.419
‐ Kurikaramaru couldn't
cut through it at all?

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:20.954
Must be demon magic.

00:10:21.021 --> 00:10:23.957
‐ Don't worry.
I'll absorb its demon power.

00:10:25.692 --> 00:10:27.260
[grunts]

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:30.063
[gasps] Why can't I
absorb its power?!

00:10:30.096 --> 00:10:32.132
‐ [laughs]

00:10:32.198 --> 00:10:35.068
Because it has nothing to do
with such things.

00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:37.370
This is
an especially sturdy armor

00:10:37.403 --> 00:10:39.706
and will not crack
from any hits it takes.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.708
Not even a diamond
would be strong enough

00:10:41.742 --> 00:10:43.076
to pierce its surface.

00:10:43.109 --> 00:10:47.981
And behold, this divine sword
is from ancient times.

00:10:49.115 --> 00:10:50.083
‐ [gasps]

00:10:50.116 --> 00:10:51.985
[groans]

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:52.986
‐ [growls]

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:54.988
[lions growling]

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:56.289
‐ Now do you see?

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:59.660
My powers are far superior
to this country's demons.

00:11:02.796 --> 00:11:03.797
Eh?

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.166
[all gasp]

00:11:10.971 --> 00:11:13.173
‐ What a distasteful escape.

00:11:14.474 --> 00:11:15.809
‐ [growls]

00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:16.743
‐ Go.

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:25.952
[bird squawking]

00:11:34.828 --> 00:11:36.329
‐ Where are we?

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:38.464
‐ Why don't we ask
the shrimp here?

00:11:38.498 --> 00:11:40.133
Who are you, anyway?

00:11:40.133 --> 00:11:42.302
‐ Moroha, no need
to be rude to him.

00:11:42.302 --> 00:11:44.838
He did save us, after all.

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:47.140
You're that kid we met
in the woods earlier, right?

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.174
Do you have a name?

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:51.011
‐ Yes. My name is Meifuku, miss,

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.378
and I'm a Meioju.

00:11:52.445 --> 00:11:55.315
‐ A Meioju.
I've heard of your kind.

00:11:55.348 --> 00:11:59.019
No other type of demon
has a shell as sturdy as yours.

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:01.121
‐ Sturdy, huh? You don't mean...

00:12:01.154 --> 00:12:02.488
‐ Would you
look over there, please?

00:12:02.488 --> 00:12:03.389
[all gasp]

00:12:04.525 --> 00:12:07.127
MOROHA: Whoa!

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.996
What the hell is that?

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.566
Man, that is one giant beastie.

00:12:12.633 --> 00:12:15.902
TOWA: Are these
demon bones, Meifuku?

00:12:15.969 --> 00:12:18.338
‐ Those are the remains
of my father.

00:12:18.338 --> 00:12:21.207
See, my father
was a really strong demon,

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:23.176
but Konton laid a trap for him

00:12:23.176 --> 00:12:25.378
using some kind
of strange spell.

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:27.147
[dramatic music playing]

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.418
‐ [growls]

00:12:32.485 --> 00:12:34.655
[roars]

00:12:34.688 --> 00:12:37.190
‐ How distasteful. Take this!

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:43.029
‐ Nothing in the world
can pierce my armored shell.

00:12:44.164 --> 00:12:46.499
Dark Lightning Cannon!

00:12:46.533 --> 00:12:48.268
‐ [grunting]

00:12:49.402 --> 00:12:51.271
‐ Did you think
you had what it took

00:12:51.337 --> 00:12:53.239
to defeat this Meioju?

00:12:54.374 --> 00:12:55.876
[gasps] Huh?

00:12:58.244 --> 00:13:00.614
‐ [laughs]

00:13:00.681 --> 00:13:03.349
I set an immobilizing field.

00:13:03.383 --> 00:13:06.052
You can no longer move.

00:13:06.052 --> 00:13:08.421
‐ [grunting]

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:10.123
[groans]

00:13:11.692 --> 00:13:12.559
‐ [grunts]

00:13:15.929 --> 00:13:16.930
[Meioju groans]

00:13:19.199 --> 00:13:21.434
‐ And now your shell is mine.

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:23.570
I intend to make good use of it.

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:24.638
‐ [groans]

00:13:24.705 --> 00:13:26.940
Damn you to hell!

00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:28.108
‐ [yells]

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:30.544
‐ [screams]

00:13:30.577 --> 00:13:32.913
‐ [gasps] Father, no!

00:13:32.946 --> 00:13:34.114
‐ Hmph.

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:36.416
‐ Run, Meifuku!

00:13:36.416 --> 00:13:38.318
[groans]

00:13:38.384 --> 00:13:40.721
‐ [gasping]

00:13:40.754 --> 00:13:43.256
[splash]

00:13:43.256 --> 00:13:45.491
After Konton killed my father,

00:13:45.559 --> 00:13:48.261
he went
and made off with his shell,

00:13:48.261 --> 00:13:49.930
and then he used it

00:13:49.963 --> 00:13:53.099
to create a strong
piece of armor for himself.

00:13:53.133 --> 00:13:55.235
‐ That's what
his breastplate was made of.

00:13:55.268 --> 00:13:56.336
‐ What I wanna know

00:13:56.402 --> 00:13:59.439
is how did he craft the shell
into the armor?

00:13:59.472 --> 00:14:00.607
[slaps]

00:14:00.641 --> 00:14:02.008
‐ Uh...
‐ [sputters]

00:14:02.075 --> 00:14:03.443
‐ Grandpa Myoga?

00:14:03.443 --> 00:14:05.746
‐ I live! As you'll recall,

00:14:05.779 --> 00:14:08.749
Konton and the other Four Perils
are from the mainland,

00:14:08.782 --> 00:14:10.183
so the spells they use

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:13.253
have origins based in Tao magic
as well as Fang magic.

00:14:13.286 --> 00:14:15.288
‐ Wow, good to know. Thanks.

00:14:15.288 --> 00:14:18.458
‐ Konton probably extracted
the shell's demon energy

00:14:18.458 --> 00:14:20.326
and then used a spell technique

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.328
to mold it
into a piece of armor.

00:14:22.362 --> 00:14:24.464
‐ When it happened,
all I could think of

00:14:24.464 --> 00:14:26.967
was that I needed
to get away from that place,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.636
but I don't want to leave things
the way they are.

00:14:29.636 --> 00:14:31.204
I've been chasing after Konton,

00:14:31.271 --> 00:14:33.640
because I want
to avenge my father.

00:14:33.674 --> 00:14:35.275
[sighs] It's just that...

00:14:35.308 --> 00:14:37.644
I don't think
there's a way I can win.

00:14:37.644 --> 00:14:40.514
I wish that I could at least
take back my father's shell

00:14:40.547 --> 00:14:42.549
so I can send him off properly.

00:14:42.616 --> 00:14:45.185
‐ How long have you
been following Konton?

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:46.452
‐ Ten years or so.

00:14:46.486 --> 00:14:48.454
‐ Ten years?!
That's way too long!

00:14:48.488 --> 00:14:51.224
‐ But I'm
just barely 50 years old.

00:14:51.291 --> 00:14:53.193
TOWA: Uh,
you're way older than me!

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:54.661
You're really 50?!

00:14:54.661 --> 00:14:55.796
‐ I'm still so young

00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:58.331
that my armored shell
is only a single layer.

00:14:58.364 --> 00:15:01.134
‐ OK, then. How much longer
do you need to grow?

00:15:01.167 --> 00:15:03.403
‐ Ideally,
another 50 years would do it.

00:15:03.469 --> 00:15:05.405
‐ You're kidding me!

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:07.373
Your armored shell
is sturdy enough,

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:08.675
so get with it already!

00:15:08.675 --> 00:15:10.511
Or give it to me. I'll use it.

00:15:10.544 --> 00:15:14.147
‐ [wails] It's not something
I can just put on and take off!

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.549
Ugh! I can't!
It doesn't work like that!

00:15:15.582 --> 00:15:17.684
‐ Then you stand in front of me
and be my shield.

00:15:17.684 --> 00:15:19.352
‐ I'd really rather not do that!

00:15:19.352 --> 00:15:20.521
SETSUNA:
They've caught up to us.

00:15:20.554 --> 00:15:21.522
‐ Eh?
‐ Ohh.

00:15:21.555 --> 00:15:24.224
[running footsteps thudding]

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:28.529
‐ Is it just the pets?

00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:36.202
MEIFUKU: Konton.

00:15:36.202 --> 00:15:38.672
‐ He truly does use
strange magic.

00:15:38.705 --> 00:15:41.775
‐ Grandpa Myoga, it might be
a good idea for you to hide.

00:15:41.842 --> 00:15:43.376
‐ Off, I go!

00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:46.446
‐ Ah, Meioju's little brat.

00:15:46.513 --> 00:15:49.382
After all this time,
you still bare your fangs at me?

00:15:49.415 --> 00:15:52.786
‐ I, um‐‐I want to‐‐

00:15:52.853 --> 00:15:55.421
‐ Yeah, you bet!
Meifuku here says he'll make you

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:57.724
regret everything
you did to his old man!

00:15:57.724 --> 00:16:00.093
‐ Oh?
You want vengeance, do you?

00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:01.728
‐ But I‐I'm not ready yet.

00:16:01.728 --> 00:16:03.396
‐ Go ahead. Tell him!

00:16:03.396 --> 00:16:05.732
Say you want
your dad's armored shell back.

00:16:05.766 --> 00:16:08.401
‐ Well, yes,
I would like to do that one day.

00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:10.070
‐ [laughs]

00:16:10.103 --> 00:16:12.438
Are you saying
you believe you can defeat me?

00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:13.640
‐ [whimpers]

00:16:13.707 --> 00:16:15.241
‐ Ah, don't worry about it, kid.

00:16:15.275 --> 00:16:17.310
The three of us
will help you with this one.

00:16:17.377 --> 00:16:19.713
We'll defeat him and
get 1,000 mon for the trouble.

00:16:19.746 --> 00:16:21.548
Even better,
if we bring his head back,

00:16:21.582 --> 00:16:23.083
we'll get a gold ingot!

00:16:23.116 --> 00:16:25.151
Now go on. We got you.

00:16:26.787 --> 00:16:31.257
‐ I will avenge him, Konton!

00:16:31.291 --> 00:16:32.425
[screams]

00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:33.459
[whimpers]

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:36.262
‐ You really are hopeless, huh?

00:16:36.262 --> 00:16:38.765
Alright. Well, in that case,
you just be my shield.

00:16:38.765 --> 00:16:40.233
‐ O‐OK!

00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:42.235
[thump]

00:16:43.403 --> 00:16:44.771
‐ Huh? But why me?

00:16:44.805 --> 00:16:46.306
‐ Yeah, shrimp! What gives?!

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:47.574
‐ She's way too scary,

00:16:47.608 --> 00:16:50.176
so can I just be
your armor instead?

00:16:50.243 --> 00:16:51.678
‐ [grunts]

00:16:51.745 --> 00:16:53.113
‐ Hah!

00:16:58.652 --> 00:17:00.787
Crimson Dragon Wave!

00:17:02.656 --> 00:17:04.691

‐ [gasps]

00:17:07.661 --> 00:17:08.662
‐ Moroha!

00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:13.600
Cyclone Burst!

00:17:16.436 --> 00:17:17.370
What?

00:17:17.437 --> 00:17:18.672
‐ Divine Speed.

00:17:19.973 --> 00:17:21.274
‐ [gasps]

00:17:23.476 --> 00:17:25.478

‐ Setsuna!

00:17:25.512 --> 00:17:27.180
Hah!

00:17:28.682 --> 00:17:29.850
[Setsuna groans]

00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:31.618
‐ TOWA: Hang on!
‐ Damn it.

00:17:31.652 --> 00:17:33.353
Guess there's no choice.

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:36.790
Alright, with this rouge,

00:17:36.823 --> 00:17:39.693
I become Beniyasha,
the Destroyer of Lands!

00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:41.828
Tremble before
the bloodthirsty daw‐‐

00:17:41.862 --> 00:17:43.196
‐ Divine Speed.
‐ [gasps]

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:44.230
[yelps]

00:17:45.632 --> 00:17:46.567
Moroha!

00:17:46.633 --> 00:17:47.801
Divine Speed!

00:17:47.834 --> 00:17:50.336
‐ [clangs]
‐ Huh?

00:17:50.336 --> 00:17:52.906
‐ [gasps] Your armored shell
really came through for me.

00:17:52.973 --> 00:17:53.907
Thanks a lot.

00:17:53.974 --> 00:17:56.142
OK, let's do this together!

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:58.378
[yells]

00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:00.346
[both grunting]

00:18:05.719 --> 00:18:07.521
‐ Hey, Meifuku,
your armored shell

00:18:07.554 --> 00:18:09.990
is just as sturdy as your dad's.

00:18:10.023 --> 00:18:13.259
‐ When my father was alive,
his was way stronger.

00:18:13.326 --> 00:18:15.529
Even with
its demon energy now removed,

00:18:15.529 --> 00:18:17.864
his is still as sturdy.

00:18:17.864 --> 00:18:20.233
‐ Its demon energy is gone?

00:18:21.535 --> 00:18:22.903
‐ Exploding Field!

00:18:24.037 --> 00:18:25.539

‐ Towa!

00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:29.843
‐ Huh?

00:18:31.878 --> 00:18:33.514
Don't you know there's no way

00:18:33.547 --> 00:18:35.248
for you to absorb
its demon energy?

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:38.685
‐ Yeah. That shell you've got on
doesn't have any in there.

00:18:38.719 --> 00:18:40.754
But don't worry about that.

00:18:41.888 --> 00:18:43.456
Have some of mine!

00:18:46.527 --> 00:18:48.394
‐ [screams]

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.397
MEIOJU: Damn you, Konton.

00:18:51.431 --> 00:18:52.899
Damn you!

00:18:52.899 --> 00:18:54.267
‐ It's father!

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.437

‐ [groans]

00:19:00.907 --> 00:19:03.409
‐ Son, Meifuku...

00:19:03.409 --> 00:19:05.245
fire a Dark Lightning Cannon.

00:19:05.278 --> 00:19:08.615
‐ Father!
It's really you, isn't it?

00:19:08.649 --> 00:19:11.985
But my Dark Lightning Cannon
isn't as strong as yours.

00:19:12.052 --> 00:19:13.654
‐ Have faith in yourself.
‐ [gasps]

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.055
‐ From this distance,

00:19:15.088 --> 00:19:17.658
your Dark Lightning Cannon
will be enough.

00:19:17.724 --> 00:19:20.426
‐ I can't.
if I do, then you'll be...

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.396
Please finally allow me
to rest, Meifuku.

00:19:23.429 --> 00:19:24.931
‐ Enough! Perish!

00:19:24.965 --> 00:19:25.932
‐ Oh, no.

00:19:25.966 --> 00:19:26.933
‐ [groans]

00:19:28.635 --> 00:19:29.636
What the...

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.338
‐ Didn't see that one coming,
did you?

00:19:32.405 --> 00:19:34.307
‐ How distasteful.

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:35.642
[gasps]

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:38.645
‐ Do it now, Meifuku.

00:19:38.679 --> 00:19:40.581
Fire your Dark Lightning Cannon.

00:19:40.614 --> 00:19:41.948
‐ Father.

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:45.952
Dark Lightning Cannon!

‐ [groans]

00:19:48.922 --> 00:19:49.956

[running footsteps crunching]

00:20:05.338 --> 00:20:07.674
MEIOJU:
You have done well, Meifuku.

00:20:07.708 --> 00:20:10.476
‐ [gasps] Father.

00:20:10.511 --> 00:20:12.445
‐ [panting]

00:20:14.447 --> 00:20:15.481
‐ [laughs]

00:20:15.516 --> 00:20:17.851
You may have wrested
my armor from me,

00:20:17.884 --> 00:20:20.320
but you've exhausted
your demon energy.

00:20:21.387 --> 00:20:22.823
Now prepare to die!

00:20:22.856 --> 00:20:23.824
‐ [gasps]

00:20:23.857 --> 00:20:25.792

‐ [groans]

00:20:39.405 --> 00:20:40.507
Damn you.

00:20:40.507 --> 00:20:42.342
‐ Now you're mine!

00:20:45.679 --> 00:20:46.680
Hmm?

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.982
[groans] The bastard got away.

00:20:49.015 --> 00:20:52.519
‐ I see.
What a troublesome spell.

00:20:52.553 --> 00:20:55.589
‐ [sighs] I'm grateful
that the two of you had my back.

00:20:55.656 --> 00:20:56.923
‐ Are you alright?

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.693
‐ I think I used
a little too much demon energy.

00:20:59.726 --> 00:21:01.494
‐ MYOGA: Lady Moroha.
‐ Hmm?

00:21:01.528 --> 00:21:02.563
‐ Huh?

00:21:02.596 --> 00:21:04.565
‐ Boing! Over here!

00:21:04.598 --> 00:21:07.367
You don't want to lose this!

[energy surges]

00:21:18.411 --> 00:21:19.713
‐ Thanks to all your help,

00:21:19.746 --> 00:21:22.415
I was able to get
my father's armored shell back.

00:21:22.448 --> 00:21:25.886
Now all I have to do is pray
that his soul rests in peace.

00:21:25.886 --> 00:21:28.522
‐ Just out of curiosity,
how long will you do that?

00:21:30.857 --> 00:21:32.893
‐ 50 years, maybe.

00:21:36.863 --> 00:21:38.699
‐ Man, I still can't believe

00:21:38.732 --> 00:21:40.734
Konton managed
to get away from us.

00:21:40.734 --> 00:21:42.903
‐ Looks like you
can't collect his bounty yet.

00:21:42.903 --> 00:21:45.071
‐ What? But we chased him away.

00:21:45.071 --> 00:21:48.542
‐ We can't collect anything
until we bring back his head!

00:21:48.575 --> 00:21:50.944
[groan echoes]

00:21:56.983 --> 00:21:58.919
[flames crackling]

00:22:02.222 --> 00:22:03.990
How distasteful.

00:22:04.057 --> 00:22:06.893
Those wretches
haven't seen the last of me.

00:22:06.927 --> 00:22:09.930
Curse you, half‐demons.

00:22:12.465 --> 00:22:14.400
[Japanese music playing]

00:23:42.589 --> 00:23:45.692
TOWA: <i>Kinka and Ginka are</i>
<i>conjoined‐twin demon brothers.</i>

KINKA: The stronger twin
consumes the weaker counterpart

00:23:48.228 --> 00:23:51.031
and finally matures
into a single powerful demon.

00:23:51.031 --> 00:23:53.066
GINKA: It's eat or be eaten!

00:23:53.099 --> 00:23:55.736

when one of us dies.

TOWA: <i>They possess</i>
<i>both me and Setsuna</i>

00:23:57.337 --> 00:24:01.041
<i>and steal the Rainbow Pearls</i>
<i>inside of our eyes.</i>

00:24:01.041 --> 00:24:02.208
Next time on Yashahime,

00:24:02.208 --> 00:24:03.777
<i>"The Gold and Silver</i>
<i>Rainbow Pearls."</i>

00:24:03.844 --> 00:24:06.613
JOKA: Good work
recovering those for me.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.883
Now I can finally have
my revenge on Sesshomaru.
