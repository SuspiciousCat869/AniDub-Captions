You look pretty tasty, monk.

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:54.721

Thanks for the meal!

[chime rings]

‐ [birds chirping]
‐ [water flowing]

00:03:57.337 --> 00:04:00.473
‐ OK, listen up. Recently
a demon has been on the prowl,

00:04:00.507 --> 00:04:02.743
attacking virtuous monks
and Shinto priests

00:04:02.743 --> 00:04:04.310
in this part of the region.

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:06.680
It seems five or six of them
have already been eaten.

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:08.915
‐ [shudders] It's eating them?

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:10.751
‐ A man‐eating demon, huh?

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:13.754
‐ We don't have a lead on who
will be targeted next yet,

00:04:13.754 --> 00:04:15.321
but the most famous here

00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:17.691
are the Buddhist priests
in the East Temple.

00:04:17.724 --> 00:04:19.893
We're going to journey there
to guard them from harm.

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:22.829
Hisui, I want you
to take these two

00:04:22.863 --> 00:04:24.430

to Brother's place.

‐ [gasps]

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:28.902
‐ I'm sure he'll be fine,
but better safe than sorry.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:32.606
‐ [sighs] I highly doubt
he'd end up getting targeted.

00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:34.440
‐ Now, don't be like that.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.710
‐ Come on, men. Let's go.
‐ BOTH: Sir.

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:41.948
‐ Alright, so where exactly
are we going, anyway?

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:43.884
‐ We're heading
to my dad's place.

00:04:43.917 --> 00:04:45.852
‐ [gasps] Your father's a monk?

00:04:45.886 --> 00:04:47.688
I can't believe
I never knew that!

00:04:47.721 --> 00:04:50.591
‐ He may be a monk,
but not a virtuous one.

00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:52.593
‐ That's rather harsh.

00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:56.597
‐ See, My dad
is a very shameless man.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.732
He takes anything he can get.

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:00.634
‐ We're still going, right?

00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:04.304
‐ Uncle ordered us to go, so we
don't really have a choice.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.707
Anyway, I wonder
how he's doing.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.609
‐ Eh?
‐ Oh.

‐ Eh?

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:27.127
‐ Before I go,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.663
is there a message you'd
like for me to take to Father?

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.431
‐ No, not really.

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:33.667
‐ Alright.
Then I'll get going now.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.442
TOWA: Your dad lives this deep
in the mountains, Hisui?

00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:44.945
‐ He's going through
the one‐thousand‐day training.

00:05:44.978 --> 00:05:48.081
‐ A thousand days?
Then that would be as much as...

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:50.116
two years, 270 days,

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.484
a long time.

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:53.086
‐ He wants divine power,

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:55.789
so he's trying to attain it
with this training,

00:05:55.822 --> 00:05:57.858
but I doubt
it'll go that smoothly.

00:05:57.858 --> 00:05:59.960
‐ How many days
have passed so far?

00:05:59.993 --> 00:06:02.462
‐ I think it's been
over two years now.

00:06:02.495 --> 00:06:03.597

Doesn't today
mark the 800th day?

00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:02.889
‐ Yeah.

00:07:02.923 --> 00:07:04.825
‐ Have you gotten any stronger?

00:07:04.858 --> 00:07:06.560

GYOKUTO: It's Hisui.

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:14.568
I don't know
who the other two are, though.

00:07:18.038 --> 00:07:20.206
‐ What are you
doing out here, Sister?

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.942
‐ Delivering some items.

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:23.710
And what brings you
all this way?

00:07:23.744 --> 00:07:25.712
‐ A demon
has recently been attacking

00:07:25.746 --> 00:07:27.781
Buddhist monks
and Shinto priests.

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:29.015
Keeping with Uncle's orders,

00:07:29.049 --> 00:07:31.618
I've come here
with my demon‐slaying friends.

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:34.020
‐ Oh! So you two
are his friends.

00:07:34.054 --> 00:07:36.923
Thank you both for taking
such good care of Hisui.

00:07:36.957 --> 00:07:38.625
I'm his big sister, Gyokuto.

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:41.562
‐ [laughs] Oh, no,
it's no trouble at all.

00:07:41.595 --> 00:07:44.130
My name is Towa,
and this is my younger sister‐‐

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.534
‐ Setsuna, I didn't realize
you'd become a demon slayer.

00:07:47.568 --> 00:07:49.536
‐ You know each other?

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:51.638
‐ Who are you?

00:07:51.705 --> 00:07:54.040
‐ You don't remember who I am?
‐ Hmm?

00:07:54.074 --> 00:07:55.642
‐ Looking the way you do,

00:07:55.709 --> 00:07:57.944
it's no wonder
she didn't recognize you.

00:07:57.978 --> 00:08:00.981
‐ This is what I wear to train.
There really is no helping it.

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:02.816
Well, if you have
no recollection,

00:08:02.883 --> 00:08:05.151
that's another form of fate.

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:09.089
And you're Setsuna's
older sister. Is that correct?

00:08:09.122 --> 00:08:10.657
‐ That's right. I am.

00:08:13.927 --> 00:08:15.796
‐ I see.

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:17.964
‐ I'm heading off
to scout the perimeter.

00:08:19.633 --> 00:08:22.769
‐ Hmm. I suppose
I'll return to my training now.

00:08:22.803 --> 00:08:24.938
‐ Um, sir, with this training,

00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:27.173
what kind of divine powers
do you hope to gain?

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.676
‐ Until I complete
my thousand days,

00:08:29.743 --> 00:08:31.645
there's no way that I can know.

00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:33.847
Moreover, it's entirely possible

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:35.916
I won't attain
any divine powers at all.

00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:38.985
‐ Really? Does that mean
you might spend a thousand days

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:40.987
training for nothing?

00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:43.256
‐ There's no such thing
as useless training.

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:44.758
‐ [gasps]

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.263
‐ I'll be satisfied even if I
only gain a little more power.

00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:52.966
‐ Do you not have confidence
in your own strength?

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:57.303
‐ Before, I possessed
a very strong power

00:08:57.337 --> 00:08:58.772
that was called the Wind Tunnel.

00:08:58.805 --> 00:09:00.841
<i>Wind Tunnel!</i>

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:09.349
Even after losing that power,
I continued to slay demons...

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:12.318
until I faced one
that was unbelievably powerful.

00:09:12.352 --> 00:09:14.354
That's when I knew
how weak I was

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:17.123
and decided to take on
some training.

00:09:17.157 --> 00:09:18.559
<i>On!</i>

00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:24.064
[both sigh]

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:25.999
‐ Say...

00:09:26.032 --> 00:09:27.901
how about I make us some tea?

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:29.002

00:09:37.644 --> 00:09:39.245
ROKUTA: Isn't that...

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:40.581
MOROHA: Huh?

00:09:40.647 --> 00:09:43.584
‐ Moroha, what are
you doing way out here?

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.586
‐ I'm being a bodyguard.

00:09:45.652 --> 00:09:46.720
ROKUTA: You're a bodyguard?

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:48.722
‐ Yeah, I picked up
a job from this temple

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:50.256
asking me
to protect their monks.

00:09:50.323 --> 00:09:53.093
I'm getting paid whether
a demon rears its head or not!

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:57.097
And if one shows, I get
a bonus for the head! [laughs]

00:09:57.163 --> 00:09:58.665
[sputters]
Hang on! Don't tell me

00:09:58.699 --> 00:10:00.601
you demon slayers want
a piece of this bounty!

00:10:00.667 --> 00:10:04.037
‐ Well, as our name says,
we're here to slay a demon.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:07.073
‐ Chief, what should we do?

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:09.610
‐ If Moroha says
she's protecting this place,

00:10:09.676 --> 00:10:11.111
we can just move on
to another one.

00:10:11.177 --> 00:10:13.379
‐ Sounds good.
Now get out of here.

00:10:13.413 --> 00:10:15.749
By the way,
where are Towa and Setsuna?

00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:18.118
‐ I sent them off
to protect a different monk.

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:21.087
‐ Well, I hope
they have fun with that,

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:23.356
even though the monk here
is the real target.

00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:26.426
‐ We'll head to the shrine
in the south instead.

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:27.360
BOTH: Right.

00:10:28.862 --> 00:10:31.064
So how about it, Rainbow Pearl?

00:10:31.097 --> 00:10:33.967
Are there any virtuous monks
at that temple?

00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:37.704
Doesn't look like it.

00:10:37.738 --> 00:10:40.206
‐ Hurry up, and come over,
man‐eating demon!

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.909
I know you wanna try to eat
the tasty monk here,

00:10:42.943 --> 00:10:44.778
and I'm ready for you!

00:10:47.914 --> 00:10:49.783
‐ [purring]

00:10:54.454 --> 00:10:56.657

00:10:56.723 --> 00:10:57.924
[giggles]

00:10:59.726 --> 00:11:02.428
Do Hisui and his father
not get along very well?

00:11:02.462 --> 00:11:05.131
‐ They're just having
a misunderstanding.

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:07.000
‐ Hisui said he was shameless.

00:11:07.067 --> 00:11:09.335
‐ Oh, well, you see‐‐[laughs]

00:11:09.402 --> 00:11:11.838
In order for father
to provide for the family,

00:11:11.905 --> 00:11:14.941
he had to spend a hefty sum.
[laughs]

00:11:14.975 --> 00:11:17.978
You could even say he might have
had to push himself at times.

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:19.245
[laughs]

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:20.446
‐ That's right!

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.348
That man is Monk Miroku!

00:11:22.415 --> 00:11:24.685
‐ Well, yes, that is his name.

00:11:24.751 --> 00:11:26.352
‐ So you do know each other.

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:29.355
‐ His Buddhist power
was definitely strong.

00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:32.125
‐ It is, but according to Hisui,

00:11:32.158 --> 00:11:35.028
he thinks our father
is nothing but a big coward.

00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:40.166
‐ GYOKUTO: Hisui!
‐ Eh?

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.969
‐ I'm borrowing Kirara
for a bit, OK?

00:11:43.003 --> 00:11:45.872
Don't forget to come home
and visit once in a while.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.374
‐ [sighs]

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:50.010
‐ Your sister's nice.
‐ [gasps]

00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:51.277
‐ See anything suspicious?

00:11:53.013 --> 00:11:54.380
‐ Of course not.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.283
That demon, it isn't
going to come here anyway.

00:11:57.317 --> 00:11:59.352
‐ Are you sure?
It seems like your father

00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:01.187
has pretty strong
Buddhist power.

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:03.389
‐ Yes, greedy as he may be.

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:06.126
‐ Yeah, well,
my dad ran away from battle,

00:12:06.159 --> 00:12:09.062
and when he did that,
he just called it training.

00:12:09.129 --> 00:12:12.298
‐ But I thought he was
training to get stronger.

00:12:12.332 --> 00:12:14.400
‐ If you can't tell
if you'll attain divine powers

00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:16.903
when it's done,
what kind of training is that?

00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:18.839
Uncle and I
are out in the real world

00:12:18.872 --> 00:12:20.507
risking our lives
slaying demons

00:12:20.541 --> 00:12:23.076
while he's cooped up here
in the mountains by himself!

00:12:23.143 --> 00:12:25.011
‐ And this displeases you?

00:12:25.045 --> 00:12:28.081
‐ I just don't want him causing
any more trouble for Mom.

00:12:28.148 --> 00:12:32.418
‐ Hmm. It's like if Papa Sota
quit his full‐time job

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:34.320
and went to train
at a ramen shop

00:12:34.354 --> 00:12:35.822
for two years instead,

00:12:35.856 --> 00:12:38.391
leaving the rest of the family
to fend for itself!

00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:40.994
‐ I have no clue
what you're talking about.

00:12:41.027 --> 00:12:42.929
‐ I know about Papa Sota,

00:12:42.996 --> 00:12:44.831
but you lost me
on everything else.

00:12:44.865 --> 00:12:46.232
[gasps] I mean,

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:48.902

doing their best, aren't they?

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:51.437
‐ Hold on. [sniffs]

00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:53.574

and it's getting closer.

Buddhist power nearby.

‐ [roars]

00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:25.471
HISUI: You've come, have you?

00:13:25.539 --> 00:13:28.108
‐ [laughs] Aha.

00:13:28.108 --> 00:13:32.045
Not as powerful as Sanzo,
but you still look delicious.

00:13:32.078 --> 00:13:34.480
‐ You mean Sanzo
from <i>Journey to the West?</i>

00:13:34.548 --> 00:13:36.282
Just who are you, anyway?!

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:38.084
‐ Huh?

00:13:38.118 --> 00:13:40.120
Me? What about you?

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.723
‐ We won't give our names
to some man‐eating demon.

00:13:42.756 --> 00:13:44.958
‐ Then I won't say mine, either.

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:46.092
[all gasp]

00:13:46.126 --> 00:13:47.628
‐ You are one of the Four Perils

00:13:47.661 --> 00:13:49.129
from the Mainland, aren't you?

00:13:49.129 --> 00:13:50.430
‐ Four Perils?

00:13:50.463 --> 00:13:51.732
‐ Well done!

00:13:51.765 --> 00:13:55.435
I expect nothing less
from a delicious‐looking monk.

00:13:55.468 --> 00:13:58.004
‐ Then he's one
of Kirinmaru's underlings.

00:13:58.071 --> 00:14:00.140
‐ The fourth and last one
is named Totetsu.

00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:03.243
‐ And you two are also correct!

00:14:03.276 --> 00:14:06.146
But I still don't know
who any of you are.

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:08.515
‐ We're the ones
who will destroy you!

00:14:08.582 --> 00:14:11.151
‐ If you're going
to get in my way,

00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:13.486
I'll just have to eat you, too!

00:14:13.486 --> 00:14:17.157
This'll be my first time
having half‐demons.

00:14:26.499 --> 00:14:29.135
Damn it. Of course
that coward would back out.

00:14:29.169 --> 00:14:31.505

What is this flavor? It's spicy.

You should try this, too!

00:14:55.228 --> 00:14:56.697
‐ Some habanero sauce.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.331
‐ "Haba‐nero"?

00:14:58.364 --> 00:14:59.833

He can suck in anything.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.509
‐ His power is almost
like the Wind Tunnel.

00:15:42.543 --> 00:15:44.778
‐ Wha‐‐Father?
But didn't you just run away?

00:15:44.845 --> 00:15:48.281
‐ I can't let myself depend on
you to handle everything for me.

00:15:48.348 --> 00:15:50.250
‐ [gasps]
‐ You do have

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.252
some demon slayer poison,
don't you?

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:53.787
‐ Yes, I do. It's right here.

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:57.090
‐ You need to get that poison

00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:59.259
to catch in the wind
that he's sucking in.

00:15:59.259 --> 00:16:00.761
Make sure of it.

00:16:00.794 --> 00:16:02.262

he's not just a vacuum.

didn't like the poison.

00:20:23.824 --> 00:20:26.026
So you can stop
standing guard now.

00:20:26.026 --> 00:20:27.393
‐ Huh?!

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.130
‐ There were these demon slayers
protecting a monk,

00:20:30.163 --> 00:20:32.398
and they drove
the man‐eating demon away,

00:20:32.465 --> 00:20:34.400
which means no more bounty.

00:20:34.467 --> 00:20:36.637
‐ [wails]

00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:41.708
‐ Well, Father, don't
push yourself too hard now.

00:20:41.742 --> 00:20:42.876
‐ Right.

00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:44.711
I'll run and hide if I must.

00:20:44.745 --> 00:20:45.812
‐ [chuckles]

00:20:45.846 --> 00:20:47.748
Alright. See you.

00:20:51.552 --> 00:20:53.086
[staff jingles]

00:20:53.153 --> 00:20:54.054
‐ Well, then.

00:20:57.023 --> 00:20:58.925
[sighs]

00:20:58.992 --> 00:21:00.060
[insects chirping]

00:21:00.093 --> 00:21:02.729
[footsteps scrape]

00:21:02.763 --> 00:21:03.897
HISUI: Mother.

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:05.398
‐ Hisui?

00:21:05.431 --> 00:21:07.568
‐ Father's training
for 200 more days.

00:21:07.601 --> 00:21:09.836
Looks like he's really
going to see it through.

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:10.904
‐ I see.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.677
I finished making
some new protective masks.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:18.912
Can you take them
to Kohaku and the others?

00:21:18.945 --> 00:21:19.913
Eh?

00:21:19.946 --> 00:21:22.415
Did something happen?

00:21:22.448 --> 00:21:23.416
Uh...

00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:25.919
uh, well, I guess so.

00:21:32.125 --> 00:21:33.927
‐ I was told by Monk Miroku

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.564
that the poison in my body
is an inherited trait.

00:21:37.598 --> 00:21:41.067
Also, if I transform
into a demon, being a half‐demon

00:21:41.101 --> 00:21:43.804
makes controlling that power
much more difficult.

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:44.871
‐ Ah.

00:21:45.939 --> 00:21:47.641
‐ You're also a half‐demon.

00:21:47.708 --> 00:21:50.076
It's possible
you inherited something as well.

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:51.978
‐ [chuckles]

00:21:52.045 --> 00:21:53.580
You may be right.

00:21:53.614 --> 00:21:55.949
We are sisters after all,
aren't we?

00:21:58.118 --> 00:21:59.753
‐ What are you doing?

00:21:59.786 --> 00:22:01.054
Get off of me!

00:22:01.087 --> 00:22:03.089
‐ Come on.
What's the harm in a hug?

00:22:03.123 --> 00:22:04.090
‐ Stop touching me.

00:22:04.124 --> 00:22:05.626
You're too clingy.

00:22:05.626 --> 00:22:08.595
‐ Boo! You're so mean, Setsuna!

00:22:12.566 --> 00:22:14.467
[Japanese music playing]

00:23:42.856 --> 00:23:45.926
MOROHA: Isn't it weird for
someone so beautiful to be here?

00:23:45.992 --> 00:23:47.193
SETSUNA:
Tamano escaped the clutches

00:23:47.227 --> 00:23:48.729
of an evil mountain god.

00:23:48.729 --> 00:23:50.897
We are the only ones
who can help her.

00:23:50.897 --> 00:23:53.266
TOWA: But Homura looked
really surprised when he saw us.

00:23:53.333 --> 00:23:55.769
HOMURA: You're those damn twins,

00:23:55.836 --> 00:23:57.938
the ones with
the Gold and Silver Pearls.

00:23:58.004 --> 00:24:00.674
To think you were still alive
after all this time.

00:24:00.707 --> 00:24:03.176
TOWA: What does he mean?
Could he possibly know us?

00:24:03.209 --> 00:24:04.945
Next time on Yashahime,

00:24:05.011 --> 00:24:07.614
<i>"The One Behind</i>
<i>the Forest Fire."</i>

00:24:07.681 --> 00:24:10.216
Setsuna and I got separated
all because of you!

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:11.885
[no audible dialogue]
