[running footsteps splashing]

00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:14.264
[cloth flutters]

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:16.266
[thunder rumbling]

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:23.273
[thunder rumbling]

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:28.862
SERVANT: His Excellency!

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.577
[door closes]

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:39.372
‐ Do I address
the Princess Half‐Demon?

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:44.669
I am Deputy Shogun of Kanto.

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:47.797
My name is
Ogigayatsu Hiiragi Danjo.

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:50.675
‐ The name's Towa Higurashi.

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:53.803
Sorry to burst your bubble,
but I'm no Princess Half‐Demon.

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:57.390
‐ She claims this is
a mistake in identity, Sokyu.

00:00:57.474 --> 00:01:00.602
‐ My Lord, by your leave,
please allow me.

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:03.396
My young princess,
this is a manuscript

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.232
you had on your person,
is it not?

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:09.402
‐ That idiot! Why'd she have
to bring that back with her?

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:12.614
‐ Are the strange things
written in here to be believed?

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:14.741
You hail from a place
called Reiwa.

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:17.243
Why don't you tell us
about this land?

00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:20.830
‐ I have to keep quiet,
or else I'd change history.

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:23.249
‐ Well, Princess? Say something!

00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:25.168
‐ Here's some friendly advice.

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.837
You should let me go right now
if you know what's good for you,

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.298
or else you're
really not gonna like it

00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:31.841
when my friends get here.

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.802
‐ [laughs]

00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:35.512
Such nonsense.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:38.223
I have something
I would like for you to see.

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.224
[claps]

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.603
‐ [gasps]

00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:48.441
Is that a bicycle seat?!

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:51.319
‐ Ah, so you
recognize this object.

00:01:51.402 --> 00:01:52.695
‐ So it would seem.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.864
She at least
knows something about it.

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:56.866
‐ What's a thing like that
doing here?

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.369
‐ You see,
this was discovered one day

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:01.955
when a local clam fisher
was raking the river.

00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:04.374
It was presented to us
soon afterwards.

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.626
[laughs]

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:09.295
There used to be rumors
in the Musashi Province.

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.673
You see, the story goes
that a priestess arrived

00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:12.882
through the Bone Eater's Well

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.635
from a faraway land
called Tokyo.

00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:16.636
‐ Tokyo?

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.180
Well? Priestess?!

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:22.267
‐ The item before you
is the saddle she used

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:25.645
to ride her mysterious
iron wagon from place to place.

00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:28.982
She and a half‐demon
by the name of Inuyasha

00:02:29.023 --> 00:02:32.569
were known to traverse the land
slaying demons of all sorts.

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:35.738
Listen well, for what
I'm about to share with you

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:38.867
is a tale that I heard
over a decade ago.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.258
KAGOME: It's been
nearly six months

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:56.593
since I made the decision

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.511
to live with Inuyasha
in the Feudal Era.

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:01.306
I know I made
the right decision.

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:06.978
Every day since
has been so peaceful.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.646
It's as though
the time we spent

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:11.524
fighting for the Shikon Jewel
was all a dream.

00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:15.361
[Japanese music playing]

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:45.952
[Japanese music playing]

00:04:58.756 --> 00:05:00.925
TOWA: "Inuyasha: Since Then."

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:04.804
GIRL: Hey look.
I found another one!

00:05:04.887 --> 00:05:06.014
‐ Hey, Sango!
‐ Can I have it?

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:07.932
‐ Oh! Hi there, Kagome.

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:09.600
‐ Mm?
‐ It's Kagome!

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:10.977
‐ Hi, Kagome!

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.687
[both laugh]

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.105
BOTH: Hey, lookie, lookie!

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:15.690
‐ What have we here?

00:05:15.773 --> 00:05:17.066
‐ We dug these up.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.402
‐ Yeah. We found
lots and lots of 'em.

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:21.362
‐ [both giggle]
‐ These are kudzu roots.

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:24.657
If we dry these out, they'll
make a really good medicine.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.617
BOTH: Wow! Really?!

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:27.994
‐ That reminds me.
‐ BOTH: Oh?

00:05:28.077 --> 00:05:30.413
‐ Here. You can have this.

00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:31.998
BOTH: What is that thing?

00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:34.417
This is called a Kikyo root.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.003
SISTERS: A Kikyo root?

00:05:37.086 --> 00:05:39.422
‐ Kikyo is very benevolent.

00:05:39.505 --> 00:05:42.800
It helps people with coughs
and even breaks a fever fast.

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:43.926
‐ That's all?

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.720
‐ I thought it was a snack.

00:05:45.803 --> 00:05:47.555
‐ BOTH: We want snacks!
‐ Hmm?

00:05:47.638 --> 00:05:50.016
‐ We want snacks!
‐ Snack time, huh? [chuckles]

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:53.603
‐ Alright, you two,
stop giving Kagome a hard time.

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:54.729
BOTH: 'k!

00:05:54.812 --> 00:05:56.731
‐ [laughs]

00:05:56.814 --> 00:05:58.649
SANGO: The seven autumn flowers?

00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:00.485
‐ Yep. It's from the Manyoshu,

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:02.862
by some poet named Yamanoue,

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:05.031
but that's all
I could remember.

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:06.407
‐ [crying]

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:07.992
‐ Ah, there, there, now.

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:09.744
No need to cry, Hisui.

00:06:09.827 --> 00:06:12.038
SISTERS: Ah,
there, there, Hisui!

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.956
‐ KAGOME: Oh, did I wake you?
‐ [crying]

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.708
‐ I know I've said this before,

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.586
but Kin'u, Gyokuto, and Hisui,

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:20.671
they all
have very unique names.

00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:21.672
[Sango laughs]

00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:23.549
They were Miroku's idea.

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:25.843
KAGOME: He sure is
an original thinker.

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:30.556
‐ [crying quiets]
‐ Speaking of,

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.434
Inuyasha and Miroku
aren't back yet, are they?

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:35.728
‐ No. From what I hear,

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:37.980
the demon they're dealing with
is giving them trouble.

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:39.690
‐ Huh?

00:06:39.732 --> 00:06:42.068
‐ A landslide
collapsed a tomb nearby.

00:06:42.151 --> 00:06:45.571
There was a demon sealed inside.
It ended up getting out.

00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:48.866
[birds squawking]

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:49.867
INUYASHA: Is this it?

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:51.786
‐ There's only bones left.

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:54.080
‐ So many of our people
have been attacked

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:55.706
since the tomb collapsed.

00:06:55.748 --> 00:06:57.083
‐ And every time, the heads

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.751
are the only things
that get taken.

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:01.003
‐ [both gasp]
‐ [staff jingles]

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:02.839
‐ Hey, Miroku.
‐ Yeah.

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:05.174
It's pursuing us from close by.

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:06.175
[grunts]

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:11.097
‐ [growling]

00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:14.767
‐ [gasps]
‐ Those are their heads!

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:15.768
‐ No way!

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:16.769
‐ [growls]

00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:18.146
Tessaiga!

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:20.565
[Root Head shrieks]

00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:22.567
‐ [gasps]
‐ Yeah!

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:27.071
‐ [scoffs] That's what you get.

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:29.699
‐ Eh?
‐ Good monk,

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:31.617
we can't thank you enough!

00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:32.952
‐ Excuse you!

00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:34.620
I'm the one that got rid of it!

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:38.040
‐ Though it seems
to have run away for now.

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:41.544
Inuyasha, our work
isn't quite finished yet.

00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:42.837
‐ Hmm?

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.797
‐ We need to see
the collapsed tomb.

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:46.215
Could you lead us to it?

00:07:48.676 --> 00:07:49.844
VILLAGER: Well, this is it.

00:07:49.927 --> 00:07:51.971
‐ It's in pretty rough shape.

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:53.514
Huh?

00:07:57.643 --> 00:07:58.769
This is...

00:07:58.811 --> 00:07:59.812
‐ Huh?

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:01.147
That's Kikyo's arrow.

00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:03.983
‐ Inuyasha...

00:08:04.066 --> 00:08:05.985
would you know
anything about this?

00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:07.987
‐ [sighs] No. Why would I?

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:09.780
‐ If you say so.

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:11.657
The next thing we should do
is head back

00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:13.576
and ask Lady Kaede about it.

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:15.286
[hoofbeats galloping]

00:08:17.663 --> 00:08:19.999
‐ [scoffs]
That village was lousy.

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:23.002
‐ Yeah, but all of them have
been like that lately, Boss.

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:25.546
‐ [gags]

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.547
[horse shrieks]

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:27.548
‐ [gags]

00:08:41.979 --> 00:08:43.272
‐ [gasps] Kirara!

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:47.318
[gasps]

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.320
This is horrible.

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:51.697
What could have caused
all of this carnage?

00:08:51.739 --> 00:08:53.157
‐ It was Root Head.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.826
‐ [gasps] Lord Sesshomaru.

00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:57.328
‐ Ah, yes, I see.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.205
The demon energy from earlier

00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:00.831
must have come from Root Head.

00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:02.833
‐ Master Jaken.

00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:06.128
Please tell me,
what exactly is this Root Head?

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:10.716
‐ A useless demon no better
than vermin, except...

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.134
‐ Except what?

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.345
‐ JAKEN: Except it's‐‐
‐ A nuisance.

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:16.013
‐ My Lord, wait!

00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:17.723
Do you mean me?

00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:21.185
[insects chirping]

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:22.853
KAEDE: There's no doubt.

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:26.357
This is my elder sister Kikyo's
Arrow of Sealing.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.901
‐ It did belong to Kikyo, then.

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:33.823
‐ This happened shortly
before my sister met you.

00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:35.908
There was once
a demon called Root Head

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:37.243
terrorizing the village,

00:09:37.326 --> 00:09:39.745
and she managed
to seal it away in a tomb.

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:41.664
‐ Why did she seal it away,

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:45.376
when instead she could have
purged it with a Sacred Arrow?

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:47.420
‐ It's a mystery.

00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:50.006
At the time,
my sister had been dealing

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:52.883
with so many demons
of all sorts.

00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:55.928
I think she was
growing tired of killing them.

00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:58.389
That was also around the time

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.391
when she helped
the bandit Onigumo,

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:03.102
who eventually became Naraku.

00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:05.938
As for Root Head...

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:09.775
it was after
my sister's Shikon Jewel,

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:14.238
much the same as you
once were yourself, Inuyasha.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.365
‐ Ah.
‐ Who cares?

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:18.200
I'm not the one
we're talking about.

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.786
[girls giggle]

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.955
BOTH: Shippo! Shippo!

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:25.833
‐ Come on, Kin‐Gyo!
Get off of me, would you?!

00:10:25.916 --> 00:10:27.418
‐ I wonder
what they're talking about.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.838
They went straight over
to Lady Kaede's. But why?

00:10:30.921 --> 00:10:32.715
‐ [girls giggling]
‐ Hmm.

00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:34.342
‐ It's obvious, isn't it?

00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:36.927
They're talking about stuff
they don't want overheard.

00:10:36.969 --> 00:10:39.138
‐ Yeah, and they told me
I had to stay here

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.723
at Lady Sango's house with you.

00:10:40.806 --> 00:10:42.308
‐ Oh, they did, did they?

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:43.934
‐ [wood clatters]
‐ Hmm?

00:10:43.976 --> 00:10:45.811
Maybe they're back!

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:47.021
[grunts]

00:10:47.104 --> 00:10:48.814
No, wait! That's not them!

00:10:48.856 --> 00:10:49.815
‐ Huh? What do you mean?!

00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:53.986
ROOT HEAD: Kikyo!

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.821
The Shikon Jewel!

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:58.449
‐ [gasps]
‐ Give it to me!

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:00.242
‐ Oh, no.

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:02.119
‐ What is that thing?
‐ [girls whimper]

00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:03.245
‐ Hey, watch out!

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:05.456
‐ Give me the Shikon Jewel!

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:08.209
‐ [gasps]
‐ SANGO: Get down!

00:11:08.292 --> 00:11:09.335
Hiraikotsu!

00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:15.424
Shippo, take care
of Kin‐Gyo and Hisui.

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:16.509
‐ Sure.

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:20.137
MIROKU: Sango!

00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:21.389
‐ Kagome!

00:11:21.472 --> 00:11:22.390
Huh?

00:11:23.891 --> 00:11:24.850
[growls]

00:11:24.934 --> 00:11:26.769
You won't get away this time!

00:11:26.852 --> 00:11:29.313
Hyah! Damn it!

00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:30.981
‐ So it's made it this far, huh?

00:11:31.023 --> 00:11:32.108
‐ Yes.

00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:33.859
‐ Kagome, are you OK?

00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:34.985
‐ Yeah.

00:11:35.027 --> 00:11:36.821
But that demon,

00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:39.281
when it got here,
it called me Kikyo.

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:40.282
‐ Wha?!

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:41.742
‐ Inuyasha!

00:11:41.826 --> 00:11:43.494
Come clean!
What are you hiding?!

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:45.246
‐ Now, let's be reasonable.

00:11:45.329 --> 00:11:46.789
I wasn't trying to‐‐

00:11:46.872 --> 00:11:48.791
Hmm?

00:11:48.874 --> 00:11:50.501
‐ [swat]
‐ Shippo, you bastard!

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:51.794
‐ [groans]

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:53.087
‐ That's enough.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.089
Lady Kagome is being targeted.

00:11:55.172 --> 00:11:57.216
It's best
if you tell her everything.

00:11:57.299 --> 00:11:58.426
‐ [both growling]
‐ Tell me what?

00:11:58.509 --> 00:11:59.969
‐ That demon was demanding

00:12:00.052 --> 00:12:02.054
for us to give up
the Shikon Jewel.

00:12:02.096 --> 00:12:04.306
‐ Yeah, but the jewel's
already been destroyed!

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:08.310
‐ Since it had been sealed away
by Lady Kikyo's arrow long ago,

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:10.062
it didn't know
that the Shikon Jewel

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:11.272
no longer exists.

00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:14.400
That demon is called Root Head.

00:12:14.483 --> 00:12:18.404
It burrows underground and
absorbs nutrients from humans.

00:12:18.487 --> 00:12:20.448
‐ Then I'm
not the only one at risk.

00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:23.159
At this rate, the local
villagers will be targeted, too!

00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:25.077
‐ That's exactly right.

00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:26.912
Six villages
near the Sacred Tree,

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:28.080
they're all in danger.

00:12:28.122 --> 00:12:29.915
We have to get rid
of this thing.

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:31.584
‐ Let's go, Inuyasha.

00:12:31.625 --> 00:12:33.085
‐ Oh. Yeah.

00:12:36.213 --> 00:12:37.923
Why isn't she mad at me?

00:12:38.007 --> 00:12:40.885
‐ He didn't need to hide it.

00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:43.095
[Root Head growling]

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.557
‐ Ah, so there you are, ugly.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.938
‐ So there you are, ugly!

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.440
It's pretty big, Kagome.

00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:56.609
‐ I see that. Leave it to me.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.028
‐ [growls]

00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:02.031
‐ [grunts] Wind Scar!

00:13:02.114 --> 00:13:04.116
‐ [roars]

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.493
[both panting]

00:13:05.576 --> 00:13:07.119
‐ [roars]
‐ [yelps]

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:09.538
[both scream]

00:13:13.083 --> 00:13:14.001
‐ [gasps]

00:13:14.084 --> 00:13:15.461
‐ [growls]

00:13:15.544 --> 00:13:16.629
[yelps]

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.172
‐ [gasps]

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:21.926
‐ Brother!

00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:23.052
‐ Kohaku!

00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:24.845
‐ [growls]

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:26.138
‐ Where's Sister?

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.306
‐ Right now,
she's guarding the children.

00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:29.141
‐ Are all of them
back at the village?

00:13:29.183 --> 00:13:32.144
‐ Yeah. I would be there,
too, if not for this!

00:13:32.186 --> 00:13:34.522
‐ Got it.
I'll go and help her out

00:13:34.605 --> 00:13:36.982
while you get the rest
of these people here to safety!

00:13:37.024 --> 00:13:37.983
‐ Alright.

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:41.153
It's moments like this

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:43.864
that make me realize
how powerless I am

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:45.115
without the Wind Tunnel.

00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:48.160
‐ [grunts]

00:13:51.038 --> 00:13:52.456
Sister, are you all OK?!

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:53.958
BOTH: Kohaku!

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:55.251
‐ Oh, good.

00:13:55.334 --> 00:13:58.420
‐ Yes. It left us alone
for some reason.

00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:01.966
SHIPPO: Uh...

00:14:02.007 --> 00:14:04.176
JAKEN: Is there something
you need, Shippo?

00:14:04.218 --> 00:14:05.678
‐ If you're
just gonna stand there,

00:14:05.719 --> 00:14:07.680
why don't you help us, huh?

00:14:07.721 --> 00:14:09.473
‐ You utter buffoon!

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:11.308
Why in the world
would Lord Sesshomaru

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.061
care what happens
to a human village?!

00:14:14.144 --> 00:14:16.272
‐ [gasps] Hi, Lord Sesshomaru!

00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:19.024
‐ Oh. He kept us safe.

00:14:20.234 --> 00:14:23.070
‐ Kohaku, you watch over Hisui.
‐ Huh?

00:14:23.153 --> 00:14:25.030
Wait. You want me to what?

00:14:27.157 --> 00:14:28.534
‐ Time to go, Kirara!

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:30.494
‐ [roars]

00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:32.496
‐ [grunts]

[gasps]

00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:35.374
‐ [growls]

00:14:35.457 --> 00:14:37.334
‐ Let go! [groans]

00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:38.669
‐ Hiraikotsu!
‐ Huh?

00:14:40.254 --> 00:14:41.213
Sango!

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:43.007
‐ Hey!

00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:45.009
Looks like you're having
some trouble there.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.218
‐ [roars]

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.595
‐ Yeah.
‐ [[growls]

00:14:47.678 --> 00:14:50.389
The demon's
multiplying itself underground!

00:14:50.472 --> 00:14:51.390
‐ [growls]

00:14:54.268 --> 00:14:55.686
[Root Head roars]

00:14:57.354 --> 00:14:59.982
‐ [growls]
‐ Damn it. There's no end.

00:15:00.065 --> 00:15:01.233
‐ Hey, Inuyasha,

00:15:01.275 --> 00:15:03.986
has there ever been
a battle here before?

00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:07.239
‐ Yeah. Neighboring provinces
had a skirmish here,

00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:10.409
which means this ugly thing
has plenty to feast on.

00:15:11.535 --> 00:15:13.579
‐ The roots burrow underground.

00:15:13.662 --> 00:15:15.414
But from where?

00:15:15.497 --> 00:15:16.415
[gasps]

00:15:16.498 --> 00:15:17.625
‐ Let's get going!

00:15:17.708 --> 00:15:19.627
[yells]

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.462
‐ Set me down there.

00:15:21.545 --> 00:15:23.672
‐ Huh? Don't be ridiculous.

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:25.257
That thing is after you,
remember?!

00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:26.550
‐ Yeah, I know!

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:28.260
All these roots
that keep popping up

00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:30.429
have to be connected
to Root Head's main body.

00:15:30.512 --> 00:15:32.348
We should use me as bait.

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:34.308
‐ No! You think
I'm gonna let you

00:15:34.391 --> 00:15:36.435
throw yourself into danger
like that?

00:15:36.518 --> 00:15:39.021
‐ I bet
you would trust this plan

00:15:39.104 --> 00:15:41.065
if it were Kikyo
instead of me, right?

00:15:41.106 --> 00:15:42.441
‐ [stammers]
‐ You see? I knew it.

00:15:42.483 --> 00:15:43.442
BOTH: Huh?

00:15:45.319 --> 00:15:46.278
‐ What?

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.279
‐ No way.

00:15:47.321 --> 00:15:48.656
‐ Is that...

00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:50.282
‐ Kikyo's arrow?

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:57.414
‐ Whoa! That was a nice shot,
Granny Kaede!

00:15:57.456 --> 00:16:00.459
‐ The arrow I just shot
was the same one

00:16:00.542 --> 00:16:04.046
that my sister used
to seal Root Head in its tomb.

00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:06.590
That should draw it
to the surface.

00:16:10.302 --> 00:16:12.805
Root Head
will definitely respond to it.

00:16:14.682 --> 00:16:16.392
‐ Look there!
‐ Yeah!

00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:19.353
‐ [gasps] It's getting away!

00:16:19.436 --> 00:16:21.355
‐ Huh? Hey, wait!

00:16:21.438 --> 00:16:23.524
‐ I won't let you escape.

00:16:28.112 --> 00:16:29.822
‐ [growling]

00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:33.450
‐ [gasps]

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:34.827
‐ Kagome!

00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:38.038
Are you all right, Kagome?

00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:39.039
‐ Yeah.

00:16:39.123 --> 00:16:40.541
‐ What is that?

00:16:40.624 --> 00:16:43.335
‐ If I were to guess,
it's Root Head's main body.

00:16:43.419 --> 00:16:46.046
‐ It finally
came out of hiding, huh?

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.048
‐ [growling]

00:16:50.634 --> 00:16:53.220
Kikyo!

00:16:53.303 --> 00:16:55.681
I'll eat you whole...

00:16:55.723 --> 00:16:58.642
Shikon Jewel and all!

00:16:58.684 --> 00:17:01.729
‐ Just so you know,
my name is Kagome!

00:17:01.812 --> 00:17:04.314
‐ And I'll fill you in
on something else!

00:17:04.356 --> 00:17:07.609
The Shikon Jewel doesn't
exist anymore, you idiot!

00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:09.403

[roaring]

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.378
‐ We got you now.

00:17:26.462 --> 00:17:28.255
Take this!

00:17:28.338 --> 00:17:30.716
Meido Zangetsuha!

00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:35.345
‐ [roaring]

00:17:41.852 --> 00:17:43.187
‐ Kagome!

00:17:43.228 --> 00:17:44.480
‐ On it!

00:17:51.695 --> 00:17:54.323
‐ Alright!
She purified the land!

00:17:54.406 --> 00:17:55.324
‐ Yes.

00:17:55.407 --> 00:17:58.118
Well done, Kagome.

00:17:58.202 --> 00:18:00.537
You've proven yourself
to be a fine priestess,

00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:02.706
even without
my sister's powers.

00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:09.546
[birds chirping]

00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:11.507
‐ [sighs]

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:13.217
[growls] The hell
were you thinking?!

00:18:13.258 --> 00:18:15.260
‐ Huh? Is something
bothering you?

00:18:15.344 --> 00:18:18.263
‐ You almost got yourself
eaten back there, damn it!

00:18:18.305 --> 00:18:21.266
‐ That's true, but I knew
that I could rely on you

00:18:21.308 --> 00:18:22.643
to keep that from happening.

00:18:22.726 --> 00:18:26.271
‐ Well, yeah, of course.
You can always rely on me.

00:18:26.313 --> 00:18:30.234
‐ I do. I have faith in you.
So it's alright.

00:18:30.275 --> 00:18:34.238
You didn't have to hide
the whole Kikyo thing from me.

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:36.448
Hmm? Inuyasha?

00:18:38.742 --> 00:18:42.287
‐ Does that mean
you're upset after all?

00:18:42.329 --> 00:18:44.540
‐ No, I'm not upset.

00:18:45.624 --> 00:18:46.583
However...

00:18:46.625 --> 00:18:47.751
Sit, boy.

00:18:47.793 --> 00:18:49.378
‐ [yelps]

00:18:49.461 --> 00:18:52.464
‐ You could have
a little more faith in me, too.

00:18:52.548 --> 00:18:54.883
‐ [stammering]

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:58.178
‐ You know, this makes me
feel a bit nostalgic somehow.

00:18:58.262 --> 00:19:01.223
‐ Let's go home.
The children are waiting for us.

00:19:01.306 --> 00:19:02.474
‐ [chuckles]

00:19:06.562 --> 00:19:08.188
KAGOME: Fate brought us together

00:19:08.272 --> 00:19:10.566
so we could trust
and care for each other

00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:14.528
and, doing so, allowed us
to overcome our destinies.

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:17.823
All that's left is for me

00:19:17.906 --> 00:19:22.870
to spend these beautiful days
side by side with Inuyasha.

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:36.550
[owl hoots]

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:42.014
SOKYU: The Bone Eater's Well

00:19:42.055 --> 00:19:44.975
resided in the Forest
of the Tree of Ages.

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:46.643
It used to be a dumping ground

00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:48.979
for demons
that had been done away with.

00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:51.023
Any bones
that had been thrown down it

00:19:51.064 --> 00:19:53.692
were known to disappear
after some time had passed.

00:19:53.734 --> 00:19:57.279
That is how it came to be known
as the Bone Eater's Well.

00:19:57.362 --> 00:20:00.574
But last I heard of it,
the well had been sealed up,

00:20:00.657 --> 00:20:02.034
so it eats no more bones,

00:20:02.075 --> 00:20:04.369
nor can anyone
pass through it any longer.

00:20:04.411 --> 00:20:05.954
‐ And yet...
‐ [gasps]

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:09.374
‐ here you are, though you
hail from Reiwa village.

00:20:09.458 --> 00:20:11.251
I'm sure the tale
of how you came

00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:12.753
to these lands is interesting.

00:20:12.836 --> 00:20:15.839
‐ Now, Princess Half‐Demon,
let's waste no more time.

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:17.758
You must tell us
how you came here.

00:20:17.841 --> 00:20:19.843
I'm sure you must know.

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:22.554
Tell us, what will happen
to the shogunate?

00:20:22.638 --> 00:20:24.389
What is the fate of our clan?

00:20:24.431 --> 00:20:25.766
‐ Excellency...

00:20:25.849 --> 00:20:27.768
‐ Hmm? What is it?

00:20:27.851 --> 00:20:29.394
‐ Run away.

00:20:29.436 --> 00:20:30.520
‐ What?

00:20:30.562 --> 00:20:31.730
‐ [door rattles]
‐ H‐Hey!

00:20:31.772 --> 00:20:32.773
‐ There's an intruder!
‐ [scuffling]

00:20:32.856 --> 00:20:34.608
‐ You'll get hurt if you stay.

00:20:34.691 --> 00:20:35.984
‐ Who are you?!
‐ Time's running out.

00:20:36.068 --> 00:20:37.319
‐ [yelps]

00:20:37.402 --> 00:20:38.987
‐ [gasps] What's happening?

00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:41.365
‐ GUARD: Stop!
‐ Shut up!

00:20:42.574 --> 00:20:44.534
Man, these guards are soft!

00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:47.412
Towa, let's get going, already!

00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:51.083
We don't have time to waste
in a place like this.

00:20:51.124 --> 00:20:52.751
‐ You really are a handful.

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:58.423
‐ Thanks, Setsuna,
and you, too, Moroha.

00:20:58.465 --> 00:21:00.592
‐ I demand answers.
Who are you?

00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:02.970
‐ Well,
it's kind of a long story.

00:21:03.053 --> 00:21:05.013
Eh? [sniffs]

00:21:05.097 --> 00:21:06.598
Aha! Yup!

00:21:06.682 --> 00:21:08.934
I knew that something
smelled funny around here!

00:21:09.017 --> 00:21:10.811
So it's you, Yotsume!

00:21:10.894 --> 00:21:11.812
‐ [groans]

00:21:11.895 --> 00:21:13.939
‐ Well, since you're here,

00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:16.775
I might as well take you out!

00:21:16.858 --> 00:21:18.527
‐ Moroha, don't rush in!

00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:22.572
‐ [groans]
‐ You're an apparition?!

00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:23.865
‐ Oh, shit!

00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:25.033
‐ You brat!

00:21:27.703 --> 00:21:28.620
‐ [gasps]

00:21:35.168 --> 00:21:38.797
‐ Hah! That bird's
a sore loser, isn't he?

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.132
‐ Moroha, wait!
‐ Eh?

00:21:40.173 --> 00:21:42.384
‐ That guy seems
like he might know something.

00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:44.594
It's better if we capture him
and make him talk.

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:47.097
‐ OK. Well, we still have
to chase him down first!

00:21:49.808 --> 00:21:50.809
‐ [sighs]

00:21:50.892 --> 00:21:51.935
Excellency.

00:21:51.977 --> 00:21:53.145
‐ Eh?

00:21:54.187 --> 00:21:55.689
‐ I'll be taking this.

00:21:56.982 --> 00:21:58.859
‐ Who exactly were those girls?

00:21:58.942 --> 00:22:00.527
‐ Oh, almost forgot.
‐ [gasps]

00:22:01.778 --> 00:22:03.488
‐ I'm taking this, too.

00:22:03.572 --> 00:22:04.489
It is mine.

00:22:05.615 --> 00:22:06.783
Gotta go now.

00:22:06.825 --> 00:22:08.827
See you around.

00:22:10.912 --> 00:22:12.831
[Japanese music playing]

00:23:41.586 --> 00:23:44.047
TOWA: Setsuna is
my younger twin sister.

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:46.508
We got separated
in a forest fire,

00:23:46.591 --> 00:23:49.052
but we finally found each other
again after 10 years.

00:23:49.094 --> 00:23:50.971
So why is she attacking me?!

00:23:51.054 --> 00:23:53.140
SETSUNA: These are the only
words I have for you‐‐

00:23:53.223 --> 00:23:55.767
I am the reason
you will die tonight.

00:23:55.809 --> 00:23:57.894
TOWA: Setsuna appeared through
the Sacred Tree at the shrine

00:23:57.936 --> 00:23:59.896
with a girl named Moroha.

00:23:59.938 --> 00:24:03.191
What? They brought
some weird demon along, too?!

00:24:03.275 --> 00:24:06.570
Next time on Yashahime,
"The Three Princesses."

00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:07.821
MOROHA: I don't believe it!

00:24:07.904 --> 00:24:09.281
You have a Rainbow Pearl, too?
