00:10:40.781 --> 00:10:43.419
‐ But if we don't kill them
now, they'll just return.

00:10:43.452 --> 00:10:46.626
‐ [sighs] You shouldn't have
to deal with such things,

00:10:46.693 --> 00:10:48.964
especially considering
you're still a child.

00:10:50.868 --> 00:10:54.041
‐ I'm a half‐demon.
That's just who I am.

00:10:54.074 --> 00:10:55.611
‐ Where are you going?

00:10:57.748 --> 00:10:59.384
‐ Back to my village.

00:11:03.092 --> 00:11:06.232
Miss Shiori welcomed me back
with open arms when I returned.

00:11:06.265 --> 00:11:09.104
She didn't ask me
any questions, either.

00:11:09.137 --> 00:11:10.975
‐ [purrs]

00:11:11.041 --> 00:11:13.981
‐ My friends were happy
that I was back, too.

00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:15.985
I thought I could live
the rest of my life

00:11:15.985 --> 00:11:17.822
in that peaceful place,

00:11:17.822 --> 00:11:19.324
‐ but I couldn't.
‐ [sighs]

00:11:19.324 --> 00:11:21.930
‐ Miss Shiori's
a half‐demon, too.

00:11:21.963 --> 00:11:24.769
There are days
she loses her demon powers.

00:11:24.802 --> 00:11:28.009
That is to say,
she also loses her barrier.

00:11:28.075 --> 00:11:31.015
One demon planned for that day,

00:11:31.081 --> 00:11:33.352
and that demon who appeared
was Gaga Gozen.

00:11:33.419 --> 00:11:35.256
‐ Gaga Gozen?

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:41.836
‐ Miss Shiori's
a half‐demon, too.

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:44.909
There are days
she loses her demon powers.

00:11:44.943 --> 00:11:47.982
That is to say,
she also loses her barrier.

00:11:48.015 --> 00:11:50.854
One demon planned for that day,

00:11:50.921 --> 00:11:53.326
and that demon who appeared
was Gaga Gozen.

00:11:53.359 --> 00:11:55.430
‐ Gaga Gozen?

00:11:55.463 --> 00:11:58.503
‐ It all happened
around three years ago.

00:12:01.843 --> 00:12:02.945
‐ Setsuna.

00:12:02.979 --> 00:12:04.047
What is it?

00:12:04.114 --> 00:12:05.149
My demon powers,

00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:07.555
it won't be long
before they're gone.

00:12:07.622 --> 00:12:10.961
I pray nothing will happen
until they return.

00:12:10.995 --> 00:12:12.832
‐ Miss Shiori!
‐ BOTH: Huh?

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:14.836
‐ There are some samurai
in the forest!

00:12:14.869 --> 00:12:16.438
‐ Yeah! And they're
heading this way!

00:12:16.472 --> 00:12:18.442
‐ Some samurai?

00:12:21.148 --> 00:12:23.954
‐ Lord Gaga,
is this the right mountain?

00:12:23.987 --> 00:12:27.460
‐ Indeed. This place is simply
swarming with half‐demons.

00:12:27.494 --> 00:12:30.500
‐ From the stories I've heard,
demons come to this mountain

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.640
all the time on the hunt
for some juicy half‐demons,

00:12:33.674 --> 00:12:35.410
but they either never find them

00:12:35.476 --> 00:12:37.347
or wind up
getting taken down themselves.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.186
‐ Have you forgotten
who it is you're talking to?

00:12:40.219 --> 00:12:41.890
Those morons
failed to find them,

00:12:41.923 --> 00:12:43.994
because they're a horde
of brainless idiots.

00:12:44.027 --> 00:12:48.035
Those demons who fell
simply weren't strong enough.

00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:50.073
Just pathetic.

00:12:51.175 --> 00:12:52.511
‐ [gasps]

00:12:52.511 --> 00:12:54.348
‐ After eating
a hundred samurai,

00:12:54.348 --> 00:12:56.251
the taste of them
simply bores me.

00:12:56.318 --> 00:12:57.521
Now all I crave

00:12:57.521 --> 00:13:00.093
are some delectable half‐demons
to whet my appetite.

00:13:00.159 --> 00:13:01.495
[laughs]

00:13:01.529 --> 00:13:03.099
[demons laughing]

00:13:03.165 --> 00:13:05.036
‐ Look, Master Miroku,

00:13:05.069 --> 00:13:07.273
just the two of us alone
can't defeat them.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.411
We need to go back
and get some reinforcements.

00:13:09.444 --> 00:13:10.614
That one's bad news.

00:13:10.681 --> 00:13:13.520
‐ That demon's already eaten
a hundred samurai.

00:13:13.553 --> 00:13:16.358
Let's look for an opening.
We'll have to slay him quickly.

00:13:16.392 --> 00:13:17.628
[staff jingles]

00:13:17.695 --> 00:13:19.097
‐ [moans]

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:22.538
I guess it's impossible
for us to see eye to eye.

00:13:22.538 --> 00:13:24.207
[music playing]

00:13:30.554 --> 00:13:32.457
‐ They may all be
samurai in appearance,

00:13:32.525 --> 00:13:34.061
but they're nothing but demons.

00:13:34.094 --> 00:13:35.463
‐ Wait. How can you tell?

00:13:35.531 --> 00:13:38.135
My nose is more sensitive
than either of yours,

00:13:38.202 --> 00:13:40.473
and they all smell like demons.

00:13:40.541 --> 00:13:41.943
‐ Then what should we do?

00:13:41.976 --> 00:13:44.381
‐ There's only two reasons
why they would come here,

00:13:44.414 --> 00:13:47.253
and those are to either to kill
or eat half‐demons like us.

00:13:47.287 --> 00:13:48.422
‐ But today's the day

00:13:48.456 --> 00:13:50.594
Miss Shiori
will lose her demon powers.

00:13:50.594 --> 00:13:51.663
‐ And her barrier!

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:55.169
‐ If they came here
with that in mind,

00:13:55.236 --> 00:13:57.140
then we're all in danger.

00:13:57.207 --> 00:13:59.077
[music playing]

00:14:07.995 --> 00:14:09.932

[horse snorts]

00:14:20.687 --> 00:14:21.623
‐ [scoffs]

00:14:26.031 --> 00:14:27.300
Behold.

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:29.438
The producer of this barrier

00:14:29.438 --> 00:14:32.277
loses their powers
during a solar eclipse.

00:14:34.314 --> 00:14:36.285
‐ Amazing as ever, Lord Gaga.

00:14:36.285 --> 00:14:37.621
‐ [chuckles]

00:14:37.655 --> 00:14:39.124
Let's do this.

00:14:39.124 --> 00:14:40.126
‐ FUTA: Wind Scythe!
‐ Huh?

00:14:40.126 --> 00:14:41.596
‐ Thunder!

00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:42.631
[demons groan]

00:14:59.131 --> 00:15:02.638
This naginata is
the infamous Kanemitsu no Tomoe.

00:15:02.671 --> 00:15:05.276
That little knife of yours
is no match for it.

00:15:05.309 --> 00:15:06.278
[grunts]

00:15:06.311 --> 00:15:07.982
[laughs]

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:11.355
Is that all you've got?!

00:15:11.388 --> 00:15:13.794
Huh? [grunts]

00:15:13.827 --> 00:15:16.331
‐ Gaga Gozen, steel yourself!

00:15:18.169 --> 00:15:19.404
[grunting]

00:15:20.507 --> 00:15:21.743
‐ Wait. That monk...

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:23.379
‐ You're done for! Thunder!

00:15:23.412 --> 00:15:25.316
‐ [screams]

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.191
‐ That guy over there's
the last one.

00:15:29.191 --> 00:15:30.092
‐ Let's get him!

00:15:31.696 --> 00:15:32.698
‐ [grunts]

00:15:32.731 --> 00:15:34.367

‐ [wails] Master Miroku!

00:15:36.506 --> 00:15:38.175
Should've listened to me!

00:15:38.175 --> 00:15:40.146
‐ [gasps]
‐ Let's go, Setsuna!

00:15:40.179 --> 00:15:41.348
‐ Let's get him, Setsuna!

00:15:41.381 --> 00:15:42.685
‐ Half‐demon brats!

00:15:42.718 --> 00:15:44.020
[breathes deeply]

[both cough]

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.532
‐ Get away from there quickly!
It's dangerous!

00:15:49.565 --> 00:15:51.235
‐ [panting]
‐ Are you two OK?

00:15:51.268 --> 00:15:52.771
‐ [laughs]

00:15:52.838 --> 00:15:55.376
Let's see how well
you can stomach my poison fog.

00:15:56.546 --> 00:15:57.715
‐ [yells]

‐ [muffled grunting]

00:16:10.072 --> 00:16:12.210
‐ [laughs]
Now you stay right there,

00:16:12.243 --> 00:16:13.445
and don't move a muscle.

00:16:13.513 --> 00:16:15.751
I'm saving you for dessert.

00:16:15.784 --> 00:16:19.525
My! All you little half‐demons
look absolutely scrumptious!

00:16:19.559 --> 00:16:20.527
[all gasp]

00:16:20.561 --> 00:16:22.565
‐ Wind Scythe!
‐ Thunder!

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:24.267
‐ [scoffs] How futile.

00:16:24.301 --> 00:16:26.138
Hah! Now, then...

00:16:26.205 --> 00:16:28.142
which one of you
shall be my appetizer?

00:16:28.209 --> 00:16:29.277
‐ [boys groan]
‐ [gasps]

00:16:29.311 --> 00:16:30.581
Please don't hurt them!

00:16:30.581 --> 00:16:32.250
‐ [laughs]

00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:34.622
I'll start with you then,
to spare you their screams.

00:16:34.655 --> 00:16:36.258
[Setsuna growls]

00:16:43.573 --> 00:16:45.309
Silly little girl.

00:16:45.376 --> 00:16:47.781
Do you truly believe
that a mere half‐demon like you

00:16:47.815 --> 00:16:50.386
can defeat me,
the great Gaga Gozen?

00:16:50.419 --> 00:16:52.090
‐ You damn maggot!

00:16:54.227 --> 00:16:55.564

Your demon blood
hasn't been abated.

00:17:15.771 --> 00:17:17.273
If you cannot quell it, then...

00:17:17.307 --> 00:17:18.510
‐ Go away!

00:17:20.847 --> 00:17:24.354
Die! Die! Die!

00:17:24.421 --> 00:17:26.291
Die!

‐ This isn't good.
‐ [snarls]

00:17:30.433 --> 00:17:32.705

Please, stop!

‐ [snarls]

00:17:33.773 --> 00:17:35.777

00:17:35.811 --> 00:17:37.715
Everything's OK.

00:17:37.781 --> 00:17:40.654
That's it.
Just take deep breaths, alright?

00:17:43.459 --> 00:17:44.394

‐ [shrieks]

00:17:46.666 --> 00:17:47.835

‐ [muffled grunting]

‐ Setsuna? Setsuna?!

00:17:54.649 --> 00:17:58.322
‐ Are you OK? Say something!

00:17:58.322 --> 00:18:01.361
Oh, dear. What you just used
didn't kill her, did it?

00:18:01.395 --> 00:18:02.463
‐ Don't worry.

00:18:02.497 --> 00:18:04.735
This is a sedative
used by demon slayers.

00:18:04.802 --> 00:18:07.407
It's especially effective
on Setsuna

00:18:07.473 --> 00:18:09.745
with her keen sense of smell.

00:18:09.812 --> 00:18:12.584
‐ [sighs] Thank goodness.

00:18:12.651 --> 00:18:14.254

00:18:17.561 --> 00:18:19.497
[wind blowing]

00:18:23.673 --> 00:18:26.980
‐ I will apply a seal that
will suppress her demon blood.

00:18:27.013 --> 00:18:28.850
This naginata
will be the medium.

00:18:34.394 --> 00:18:36.264
Alright. Now let us begin.

00:18:38.369 --> 00:18:40.741
Meet an arhat,
then slay the arhat.

00:18:40.774 --> 00:18:43.680
Meet your parents,
then slay your parents.

00:18:43.713 --> 00:18:46.385
Know that the light to your path
lies therein.

00:18:46.418 --> 00:18:47.521
[grunts]

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:56.271
[sighs] That does it.

00:18:56.338 --> 00:18:57.675
For now, at least.

00:18:57.708 --> 00:18:59.879
The demon blood
that Setsuna has inherited

00:18:59.912 --> 00:19:02.584
is too powerful
for her half‐demon body.

00:19:02.618 --> 00:19:05.891
‐ Excuse me,
but if I'm not mistaken,

00:19:05.891 --> 00:19:07.026
you're Monk Miroku, right?

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.462
‐ Yes, I am.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:11.401
It's good to see
you're doing well, Lady Shiori.

00:19:11.401 --> 00:19:13.873
You grew up beautifully,
as expected.

00:19:13.907 --> 00:19:15.911
Oh, and your mother,
is she here?

00:19:15.944 --> 00:19:18.550
‐ No. She passed away.

00:19:18.583 --> 00:19:20.419
She succumbed to an illness.

00:19:21.789 --> 00:19:23.258
‐ I'm sorry to hear that.

00:19:23.292 --> 00:19:25.329
Such is the fate of humans.

00:19:25.396 --> 00:19:28.068
<i>‐ A few weeks</i>
<i>after Monk Miroku left,</i>

00:19:28.102 --> 00:19:29.437
<i>Miss Shiori told me</i>

00:19:29.471 --> 00:19:31.609
<i>it was time for me</i>
<i>to leave the village as well.</i>

00:19:31.642 --> 00:19:34.782
‐ Setsuna, no longer
are you so weak

00:19:34.815 --> 00:19:36.919
that you must hide yourself
away from the world.

00:19:36.953 --> 00:19:40.493
Go and start life anew,
for your own sake.

00:19:41.763 --> 00:19:43.633
‐ Setsuna,
take care of yourself.

00:19:43.666 --> 00:19:45.570
‐ Take care of yourself,
Setsuna!

00:19:45.604 --> 00:19:47.775
‐ You know,
the time will one day come

00:19:47.808 --> 00:19:49.945
when you two will have
to leave this village.

00:19:49.945 --> 00:19:52.316
‐ [both gasp]
‐ Setsuna is just leaving

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:54.454
a little bit earlier
than everyone else.

00:19:54.487 --> 00:19:56.692
‐ BOTH: I don't wanna!
‐ [laughs]

00:19:56.759 --> 00:19:58.930
And, Setsuna,
If you happen to meet

00:19:58.963 --> 00:20:00.867
a half‐demon child
who's in trouble,

00:20:00.934 --> 00:20:03.072
please tell them
about this village, OK?

00:20:03.105 --> 00:20:05.076
‐ Yes, I will.

00:20:05.109 --> 00:20:08.015
‐ Well, then,
have a safe journey, Setsuna.

00:20:08.082 --> 00:20:09.350
‐ Thank you.

00:20:19.505 --> 00:20:21.642
Back
at Priestess Kaede's village,

00:20:21.676 --> 00:20:24.481
I was invited to enlist
with the demon slayers.

00:20:24.515 --> 00:20:26.619
‐ [meows]
‐ I didn't know until recently

00:20:26.652 --> 00:20:29.324
that Monk Miroku
was Hisui's father.

00:20:29.357 --> 00:20:32.831
‐ So that naginata was
a trophy from that battle, huh?

00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:35.002
‐ This was forged
by human hands.

00:20:35.035 --> 00:20:37.039
I'm grateful
to have it with me.

00:20:37.106 --> 00:20:40.379
It also acts as a seal
to keep my demon powers in line.

00:20:40.446 --> 00:20:41.983
‐ [grunts]
‐ [gasps]

00:20:42.016 --> 00:20:45.991
‐ You sure talked a lot more
than usual today. Why is that?

00:20:45.991 --> 00:20:48.730
‐ Because I made a promise
to Miss Shiori when I left,

00:20:48.797 --> 00:20:50.901
if I found a troubled
half‐demon child,

00:20:50.967 --> 00:20:52.704
I'd tell them
about this village.

00:20:52.738 --> 00:20:55.342
‐ What are you talking about?
I may be a half‐demon,

00:20:55.376 --> 00:20:57.681
but I'm not troubled,
and I'm not even a child!

00:20:57.714 --> 00:20:59.718
‐ [laughs]
‐ Jeez.

00:20:59.752 --> 00:21:00.687
‐ [gasps]

00:21:03.158 --> 00:21:05.597
[heavy footsteps thudding]

00:21:05.664 --> 00:21:07.033
‐ This is the place.

00:21:07.066 --> 00:21:10.339
It's said half‐demons can be
found hiding in this mountain.

00:21:10.372 --> 00:21:11.976
‐ They must think
they're so clever.

00:21:12.009 --> 00:21:13.011
Let's find them quickly.

00:21:13.011 --> 00:21:14.715
My stomach's
been growling all night.

00:21:14.748 --> 00:21:16.485
‐ [yells]

00:21:16.519 --> 00:21:17.721
‐ [shrieks]

00:21:17.754 --> 00:21:18.857
‐ [gasps]

00:21:20.092 --> 00:21:24.869
‐ My horns! [shrieks]

00:21:24.902 --> 00:21:27.106
‐ You must think
you're so clever, don't you?

00:21:27.173 --> 00:21:29.545
If you ever come here again...

00:21:29.545 --> 00:21:31.047
I'll make you beg for death.

00:21:31.081 --> 00:21:33.720
[both whimpering]

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:37.460
‐ Vermin like them still manage
to make their way out here.

00:21:37.528 --> 00:21:40.734
Honestly, I hope things
can quiet down a little.

00:21:40.767 --> 00:21:44.708
‐ Setsuna, you do this
pretty regularly, don't you?

00:21:44.742 --> 00:21:47.915
‐ When I can,
if I have the time to.

00:21:47.948 --> 00:21:49.952
‐ Makes sense.
I totally get why.

00:21:50.019 --> 00:21:51.856
It's because this place
is your home, right?

00:21:52.958 --> 00:21:54.427
‐ Kirara!
‐ [meows]

00:22:03.445 --> 00:22:05.416
‐ Thank you, Setsuna.

00:22:12.463 --> 00:22:14.400
[Japanese music playing]

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:46.184
TOWA: <i>While watching</i>
<i>some winter fireflies together,</i>

00:23:46.217 --> 00:23:48.923
<i>Riku tells me about the madam</i>
<i>who used to care for him</i>

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:51.829
<i>and about his master who</i>
<i>loves gazing up at the stars.</i>

00:23:51.862 --> 00:23:54.233
<i>‐ Then I, Totetsu,</i>
<i>crash the party!</i>

00:23:54.267 --> 00:23:57.507
RIKU: Damn bastard! You ruined
my date with Lady Towa!

00:23:57.541 --> 00:24:00.714
‐ Why are you risking
your life for me, Riku?

00:24:00.747 --> 00:24:02.149
<i>Next time on "Yashahime,"</i>

00:24:02.183 --> 00:24:04.187
<i>"Secret of the Rainbow Pearls."</i>

00:24:04.187 --> 00:24:07.026
‐ These Pearls were born on
the night that your grandfather,

00:24:07.026 --> 00:24:08.997
the Great Dog‐Demon,
passed away.
