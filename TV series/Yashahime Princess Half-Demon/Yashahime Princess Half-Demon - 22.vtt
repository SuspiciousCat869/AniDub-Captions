And it's all thanks
to the both of you.

‐ Kirinmaru deserves
the bulk of the credit.

I'm merely here
to provide support.

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:31.258

must continue this existence.

00:01:54.815 --> 00:01:59.152

I already know what would happen

00:05:23.257 --> 00:05:25.659
if I called you charming
in front of Sango.

00:05:25.726 --> 00:05:28.595
What is your true purpose
for being here, if I may ask?

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:30.998
‐ Allow me
to be straightforward.

00:05:30.998 --> 00:05:32.499
I'd like you to release the seal

Wait. Do you mean Setsuna?

And if I refuse to be of help?

00:05:40.407 --> 00:05:42.643

Lend me the fruits
of your training

I wonder, what is this feeling?

00:06:40.501 --> 00:06:43.637
It's definitely not
the same kind of feeling I get

00:06:43.704 --> 00:06:45.939
when Papa Sota hugs me.

00:06:47.975 --> 00:06:50.143

From what I've heard,
Mr. Jyubei knows

00:07:04.625 --> 00:07:06.326
of a very skilled

00:07:28.415 --> 00:07:30.651
Since you asked,
the blade sharpener

00:07:30.717 --> 00:07:34.388
that Mr. Jyubei was going to
introduce you to is yours truly!

00:07:34.421 --> 00:07:37.057

You can even sharpen blades?!

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.158

Sesshomaru's daughters

are the ones responsible.

00:07:55.108 --> 00:07:57.878

Believe it or not, yes.

00:07:57.911 --> 00:08:01.615
But they're still pups whose
fangs have yet to fully grow.

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:04.818
They could barely face me,
let alone fulfill the prophecy.

00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:07.254

00:08:08.922 --> 00:08:10.157

I'm only going out
for a little walk.

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:15.662
‐ Try not to get
too carried away.

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:18.565
‐ Oh, so you have
no regard for my safety?

00:08:18.599 --> 00:08:20.667
‐ I simply mean we should wait

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:23.237
for them to gain
a bit more experience.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.906

You speak of his blood
that she inherited, yes?

00:08:34.114 --> 00:08:35.983
Even so,
she could barely control

00:08:35.983 --> 00:08:37.985
the Great Dog‐Demon's power.

00:08:37.985 --> 00:08:40.654
She is still
far from mastering it.

00:08:40.721 --> 00:08:43.490
‐ You're talking about
the quarter‐demon girl.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.293
I was actually referring
to the half‐demons.

00:08:46.326 --> 00:08:47.427
‐ What about them?

00:08:48.328 --> 00:08:50.397
‐ If the seal
were to be released,

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:53.300
even you wouldn't get away
with only a scratch.

00:08:53.333 --> 00:08:56.403
I'll see what I can find out
during my walk.

‐ Give it back.

00:09:08.649 --> 00:09:11.084
I knew you wouldn't be able
to handle it after all.

00:09:11.118 --> 00:09:12.586

my professional opinion!

00:09:12.619 --> 00:09:14.655
I'm the best blade sharpener
around here!

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:16.790
Anyone else would tell you
the same thing I did.

00:09:16.823 --> 00:09:19.293
‐ Alright.
Then why isn't it going well?

00:09:19.326 --> 00:09:20.427
‐ Well, how should I know?

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.729
You might even
be the reason, Setsuna.

00:09:22.763 --> 00:09:24.898
Your demon blood
could be getting stronger.

00:09:24.932 --> 00:09:28.569
The sealed poison is probably
what's affecting its sharpness.

00:09:28.602 --> 00:09:30.370
‐ Are you saying
that I should consult

00:09:30.404 --> 00:09:32.139
with Monk Miroku instead?

00:09:32.206 --> 00:09:34.575
‐ Yeah, maybe.
I told you I'm a professional.

00:09:34.608 --> 00:09:36.310
You can't go blaming me
for everything.

00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:37.744
‐ No, I'm still pretty certain

00:09:37.778 --> 00:09:40.047
you're just not as skilled
as you think you are.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.915

Well met, young lady.

Come on!
Let's get going already.

00:18:27.207 --> 00:18:29.142
but even then,
it was just barely.

00:18:29.209 --> 00:18:31.378
‐ That's right.
Setsuna told me that also.

00:18:31.378 --> 00:18:33.914
[grunts] I'll be
the one to calm her down.

00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:34.882
Leave that part to me.

00:18:34.882 --> 00:18:37.117
The only thing
you have to focus on, Kin'u,

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:38.418
is restoring her seal.

00:18:38.452 --> 00:18:39.720
‐ You sure about that?

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.089
‐ Yeah! I'm the older sister,
after all.

00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:43.957
Let's do it, Takechiyo.

00:18:43.991 --> 00:18:45.492
‐ Fine.

00:18:46.393 --> 00:18:47.961
‐ She's really brave, huh?

00:18:47.995 --> 00:18:49.763
Unlike this other sister
I know of.

00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:53.500
‐ [scoffs] You better not
be referring to me, Hisui!

00:18:53.567 --> 00:18:55.536
[booming]

00:18:55.536 --> 00:18:57.037

00:19:07.714 --> 00:19:08.916
[groaning]

00:19:10.884 --> 00:19:13.554
Damn it, Setsuna.
You're way too strong.

00:19:16.056 --> 00:19:17.591
‐ [growls]

00:19:17.624 --> 00:19:18.992

[screaming]

00:19:23.897 --> 00:19:25.566
‐ Setsuna!

00:19:28.268 --> 00:19:30.037
Setsuna, please!
You have to calm down!

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.806
Please try to calm down!

00:19:34.875 --> 00:19:35.876
[coughs]

00:19:35.876 --> 00:19:38.478
[grunting]

00:19:38.545 --> 00:19:41.281
It's me, Setsuna, your sister.

00:19:41.315 --> 00:19:42.282
It's Towa!

00:19:42.316 --> 00:19:43.717
‐ [shrieks]

00:19:43.717 --> 00:19:46.887
‐ Come on!
Get it together, Setsuna!

00:19:46.887 --> 00:19:47.788
[Setsuna gasps]

00:19:50.991 --> 00:19:53.293
<i>That voice.</i>

00:19:53.327 --> 00:19:55.229
<i>It's Towa.</i>

00:19:55.229 --> 00:19:56.797
<i>I can hear her.</i>

00:19:57.998 --> 00:20:00.067
<i>She's calling for me.</i>

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.436
‐ Setsuna, please listen to me!

00:20:02.469 --> 00:20:04.972
It's OK! I'm right here!

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:06.373
You're not alone!

00:20:06.406 --> 00:20:08.075
Your older sister...

00:20:08.108 --> 00:20:10.577
is right here for you!

00:20:10.611 --> 00:20:12.813
[hearts beating]

00:20:15.082 --> 00:20:16.984

HISUI: Towa! Setsuna!

00:20:30.264 --> 00:20:31.999
Sister, please hurry.

00:20:34.868 --> 00:20:37.638
KIN'U: Meet an arhat,
then slay the arhat.

00:20:37.704 --> 00:20:40.440
Meet your parents,
then slay your parents.

00:20:40.474 --> 00:20:43.710
Know that the light to your path
lies therein.

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:44.945
Hup!

00:20:47.147 --> 00:20:48.482
HISUI: Huh? Look.

00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:50.884
That bruise on her right arm
didn't disappear.

00:20:50.918 --> 00:20:53.887
That's odd. I swore
I did the spell correctly.

00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:55.122
‐ [groans]

00:20:55.155 --> 00:20:57.057
TOWA: Setsuna!

00:20:57.057 --> 00:20:58.292
‐ Towa.

00:20:58.325 --> 00:20:59.560
‐ Hey, you're OK.

00:20:59.593 --> 00:21:01.762
I'm so glad
you're back to normal.

00:21:02.763 --> 00:21:04.731
‐ Sorry, but I'm
afraid it's too soon

00:21:04.765 --> 00:21:06.099
to celebrate just yet.

00:21:06.133 --> 00:21:09.469
I can still feel
the blood seething.

00:21:09.536 --> 00:21:10.571
‐ Setsuna?

00:21:10.604 --> 00:21:13.707
‐ That woman's going to regret
what she did to me.

00:21:13.707 --> 00:21:17.077
I'll return the favor
a million times over!

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.046

00:21:24.751 --> 00:21:25.752
‐ [chuckles]

00:21:25.786 --> 00:21:29.056
Nothing will ever stop me
from being who I am.

00:21:29.089 --> 00:21:32.893
That is what you wanted,
right, My Lord?

00:21:32.893 --> 00:21:35.596
Now then, all that's left
is to figure out

00:21:35.629 --> 00:21:38.565
what to do about
the other half‐demon girl.

00:21:42.035 --> 00:21:44.471
[jets roaring]

00:21:47.908 --> 00:21:51.578
‐ It's getting
awfully close now, isn't it?

00:21:51.612 --> 00:21:52.613
Interesting.

00:21:52.646 --> 00:21:54.948
So the Grim Comet
still appears,

00:21:54.982 --> 00:21:56.984
even in this era.

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:58.986
[people murmuring]

00:21:59.052 --> 00:22:01.154
‐ [sighs]

00:22:01.221 --> 00:22:02.322
What's this?

00:22:04.291 --> 00:22:07.461
Well, now,
if it isn't Mr. Higurashi.

00:22:10.764 --> 00:22:12.666
[Japanese music playing]

TOWA: <i>We use remains from</i>
Azusa no Yumihari <i>to find Zero,</i>

00:23:45.392 --> 00:23:46.927
<i>but Riku gets in our way.</i>

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.129
‐ Would you honor me
with a battle?

00:23:49.162 --> 00:23:51.665
‐ I got you now! Take this!

00:23:51.732 --> 00:23:53.967
‐ So you've come
to return the favor.

00:23:54.001 --> 00:23:55.802
I like you,
Half‐Demon Princesses!

TOWA: <i>What's the meaning</i>
<i>of these inherited powers?</i>

00:23:58.639 --> 00:24:01.241
<i>We'll discover the answer</i>

00:24:01.275 --> 00:24:03.243
Next time on Yashahime,

what I'm capable of, Zero.
