TOWA: <i>Towa and Setsuna.</i>

00:00:08.584 --> 00:00:10.655
<i>Between us half‐demon twins,</i>

00:00:10.655 --> 00:00:13.393

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.508
<i>peace and war,</i>

00:00:20.508 --> 00:00:22.177
<i>joy and sorrow,</i>

00:00:22.244 --> 00:00:23.681

00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:34.168
<i>We'll keep moving forward,</i>

00:00:34.202 --> 00:00:37.007
<i>overcoming</i>
<i>the hurdles of destiny!</i>

00:00:37.074 --> 00:00:38.978
[waves crashing]

[mysterious music playing]

00:00:45.758 --> 00:00:48.496
KYUKI: Our enemy,
the Great Dog‐Demon of the West,

00:00:48.531 --> 00:00:51.436
has been spotted
in the vicinity of Kamakura.

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.275
‐ So he's come here, has he?

00:00:54.308 --> 00:00:57.549
KONTON: What's more,
he has sustained grave injuries

00:00:57.616 --> 00:00:59.553
from battling
Shishinki and Ryukotsusei.

00:00:59.553 --> 00:01:01.389
If we make our move now,

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:03.728
we may easily be able
to strike him down.

00:01:03.794 --> 00:01:05.063
[Kirinmaru sighs]

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.468
‐ Let us use this chance
to put an end to him

00:01:07.502 --> 00:01:10.274
so we may finally rule
over the entire land.

00:01:10.307 --> 00:01:13.046
‐ Lord Kirinmaru, simply give
the order, and we will‐‐

00:01:13.113 --> 00:01:14.382
‐ You fools!
‐ [both gasp]

00:01:17.522 --> 00:01:19.793
‐ If I am
to challenge him to battle,

00:01:19.826 --> 00:01:23.300
it cannot be after he
has been wounded and made weak.

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:26.406
A true battle must be won
with honor and dignity.

00:01:26.406 --> 00:01:29.078
Is that too much
for you cowards to understand?

00:01:29.145 --> 00:01:30.080
BOTH: Forgive us.

00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:32.819
‐ Riku. Riku, are you here?

00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:34.823
‐ Yes, Master.

00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:38.531
‐ [scoffs]
‐ [growls]

00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:40.902
‐ Gather the finest
medicinal herbs you can find

00:01:40.935 --> 00:01:43.874
and deliver them to
the Great Dog‐Demon immediately.

00:01:43.908 --> 00:01:45.678
Now go.

00:01:45.712 --> 00:01:47.314
‐ Understood.

00:01:47.348 --> 00:01:49.553
[tone chimes]

00:01:49.586 --> 00:01:51.824
‐ Battle is meaningless
unless both sides

00:01:51.857 --> 00:01:53.861
are willing to give their all
for victory.

00:01:53.894 --> 00:01:56.366
Adopting
underhanded tactics to win

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.269
will only leave you empty.

00:01:58.269 --> 00:01:59.606
BOTH: Yes, my Lord.

00:01:59.606 --> 00:02:01.543
[Zero laughs]

00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:06.854
If he could only learn
the meaning of compromise.

00:02:06.887 --> 00:02:09.860
That boy causes us
no end of trouble.

00:02:09.893 --> 00:02:13.868
If he weren't so obstinate,
we'd already be ruling the land.

00:02:16.874 --> 00:02:17.842
‐ [villagers gasp]
‐ What's going on?

00:02:17.876 --> 00:02:18.844
‐ Oh, no. Look.

00:02:18.878 --> 00:02:21.850
‐ Lady Izayoi's mansion
is on fire.

00:02:21.884 --> 00:02:24.623
‐ [unemotional] Oh, no. I guess
I didn't make it in time.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.560
[villagers murmuring]

00:02:26.593 --> 00:02:29.800
RIKU:
The Great Dog‐Demon is dead.

TOWA: <i>"Secret of</i>
<i>the Rainbow Pearls."</i>

00:04:17.916 --> 00:04:19.886
‐ The Great Dog‐Demon is dead?

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.592
How is that possible?

00:04:22.592 --> 00:04:23.894
It can't be.

00:04:23.928 --> 00:04:25.665
But we are demons.

00:04:25.698 --> 00:04:28.838
Are we not fated
to journey an endless path,

00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:31.877
destined to traverse
the edges of eternity itself?

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.581
Curses.

00:04:33.647 --> 00:04:35.918
The Shikon Jewel's
ominous prophecy

00:04:35.985 --> 00:04:38.891
has proven itself
to be true after all.

00:04:38.924 --> 00:04:42.599
‐ That's right, Madam.
The Great Dog‐Demon is dead.

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:46.038
But Izayoi and
the half‐demon child survived.

00:04:46.072 --> 00:04:48.611
‐ I'd expect as much.

00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:52.284
Those who are loved are fated
to perish in grace and beauty.

00:04:52.351 --> 00:04:53.687
‐ Madam...

00:04:53.721 --> 00:04:55.390
what's coming from your eyes?

00:04:55.423 --> 00:04:57.427
They're so beautiful.

00:04:57.461 --> 00:04:59.799
‐ [gasps] You dare
call these beautiful?!

00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:02.271
You must have truly poor taste
to even think that.

00:05:02.337 --> 00:05:03.741
‐ "Poor taste"?

00:05:03.774 --> 00:05:05.611
‐ Try and use
that head of yours!

00:05:05.678 --> 00:05:06.914
‐ Do you mean...

00:05:06.947 --> 00:05:08.617
use it like this?

00:05:08.684 --> 00:05:10.253
‐ [scoffs]

00:05:11.623 --> 00:05:13.527
I don't need demon powers.

00:05:13.561 --> 00:05:14.896
I don't want this grief.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.535
In fact, I don't even
want this heart,

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:20.775
and I swear I shall never shed
these wretched tears again.

00:05:20.808 --> 00:05:25.417
Shikon Jewel,
grant me that which I desire!

00:05:32.431 --> 00:05:33.734
RIKU: Those are pretty.

00:05:38.076 --> 00:05:39.813
‐ These seven Rainbow Pearls

00:05:39.813 --> 00:05:41.950
contain not only
my demon powers,

00:05:41.984 --> 00:05:44.823
but the very power
of the Shikon Jewel itself.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.060
Good riddance. I'm finally free

00:05:47.094 --> 00:05:49.498
from having
to call myself a demon.

00:05:49.498 --> 00:05:50.568
‐ But, Madam...

00:05:50.601 --> 00:05:51.570
‐ What is it?

00:05:51.603 --> 00:05:54.074
‐ You're not sad?

00:05:54.108 --> 00:05:55.678
‐ What's there to be sad about?

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.819
‐ Never mind. It's nothing.

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:04.629
[wind blowing]

00:06:04.663 --> 00:06:07.334
‐ 200 years have gone by,
my Madam.

00:06:08.771 --> 00:06:10.675
I may only have three so far,

00:06:10.675 --> 00:06:13.847
but it won't be long
until I have all seven for you.

00:06:15.016 --> 00:06:17.487
SETSUNA: Understand, Towa?
Stay here.

00:06:17.522 --> 00:06:19.593
Don't go anywhere tonight.
I mean it.

00:06:19.626 --> 00:06:21.697
‐ TOWA: I know, I know.
‐ Huh?

00:06:21.697 --> 00:06:23.867
‐ I swear to come back
as soon as I'm done.

00:06:23.867 --> 00:06:27.174
Until then, be a good girl, and
stay quiet like little Kirara.

00:06:27.207 --> 00:06:29.546
‐ I said I get it, OK?!

00:06:29.546 --> 00:06:30.848
‐ Are you ready to go?

00:06:30.881 --> 00:06:31.883
‐ I'm ready.
‐ Kirara.

00:06:31.883 --> 00:06:32.819
‐ [meows]

00:06:34.623 --> 00:06:36.560
[growls]

00:06:36.627 --> 00:06:39.532
‐ That was a more thorough
warning than usual, wasn't it?

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:41.068
‐ It was. I had no choice.

00:06:41.135 --> 00:06:43.641
You see, tonight is
the night of the new moon,

00:06:43.674 --> 00:06:46.045
when Towa loses
her demon powers.

00:06:46.045 --> 00:06:47.849
‐ Seriously...

00:06:47.882 --> 00:06:50.521
who does she think she is,
treating me like a kid?

00:06:50.554 --> 00:06:52.892
I mean,
I'm the older twin after all.

00:06:52.892 --> 00:06:55.463
‐ You really do look like her.

00:06:55.497 --> 00:06:56.967
‐ What, you mean like Setsuna?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.906
‐ Not her.
You remind me of your mother.

00:06:59.906 --> 00:07:03.747
‐ [gasps] Granny Kaede, are you
telling me you know our mother?

00:07:03.814 --> 00:07:05.718
‐ Yes, very well.

00:07:05.751 --> 00:07:08.590
We lived together
for many years, actually.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.928
‐ Since Setsuna and I
are half‐demons,

00:07:10.995 --> 00:07:13.433
that would mean our mother
was fully human, wouldn't it?

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:15.070
‐ Yes. Her name was Rin.

00:07:15.103 --> 00:07:17.474
She was a very kind
and caring soul.

00:07:18.644 --> 00:07:21.516
<i>However, some time</i>
<i>after she gave birth</i>

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:22.986
<i>to you and your sister,</i>

00:07:23.019 --> 00:07:26.760
<i>she suddenly disappeared</i>
<i>and was nowhere to be foun.</i>

00:07:26.827 --> 00:07:29.498
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if someone took her away</i>

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:32.605
<i>or if she simply left</i>
<i>on her own accord.</i>

00:07:34.542 --> 00:07:36.613
It has been
14 years since then,

00:07:36.613 --> 00:07:38.717
and still no trace of her.

00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:40.453
‐ I wonder if she died.

00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:41.957
‐ That may be the case.

00:07:41.957 --> 00:07:45.063
‐ That's a pretty cold thing
for you to say, Granny Kaede.

00:07:45.096 --> 00:07:47.200
‐ I'm sorry. At my age,

00:07:47.234 --> 00:07:49.606
death becomes little more
than a familiar face

00:07:49.606 --> 00:07:52.110
you greet as you pass
on the road of life.

00:07:52.177 --> 00:07:54.716
‐ I didn't realize. I'm sorry.

00:07:54.749 --> 00:07:56.586
I guess there's
still a lot in this world

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.122
I don't fully understand.

00:07:58.189 --> 00:08:01.563
‐ You're a kind child,
just like your mother.

00:08:01.596 --> 00:08:04.636
It's getting late.
Try and get some rest.

00:08:04.636 --> 00:08:06.472
‐ Thanks. I think I will.

00:08:07.742 --> 00:08:08.811
Night, Granny.

00:08:15.056 --> 00:08:16.092
TOWA: <i>Setsuna?</i>

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:22.437
<i>Hey, it's the Sacred Tree.</i>

00:08:25.978 --> 00:08:28.449
<i>Wait. It's that woman again.</i>

00:08:30.588 --> 00:08:33.827
<i>Could it be</i>
<i>that she's our mother?</i>

00:08:37.835 --> 00:08:39.171
[murmurs]

00:08:40.674 --> 00:08:42.979
Looks like the new moon
hasn't ended yet.

00:08:43.012 --> 00:08:45.116
[gasps] What's that light?

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.620
Wait a second. Is that the‐‐

00:08:46.653 --> 00:08:47.955
It's the butterfly,

00:08:47.989 --> 00:08:49.993
the same one
I saw in my dream.

00:08:50.026 --> 00:08:51.997
[peaceful music playing]

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:54.201
Slow down, Dream Butterfly!

00:08:54.268 --> 00:08:58.009
<i>Hey, this is the Forest</i>
<i>of the Tree of Ages.</i>

00:08:58.076 --> 00:09:01.516
<i>This is just like</i>
<i>what I saw in my dream.</i>

00:09:06.593 --> 00:09:08.597
Now which way did it go?

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:10.333
I'm in front
of the Tree of Ages.

00:09:10.366 --> 00:09:13.106
I would always stand here
looking up at it

00:09:13.139 --> 00:09:14.609
back in my own time.

00:09:14.642 --> 00:09:16.847
This is where
the Higurashi Shrine will be,

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.318
but that won't be
for another 500 years.

00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:22.725
But somehow I feel like
this forest is sorta different.

00:09:22.725 --> 00:09:25.564
It's not the same one
that Setsuna and I grew up in.

00:09:25.631 --> 00:09:27.134
‐ [wind gusting]
‐ [winces]

00:09:27.167 --> 00:09:29.873
It's so cold. Let me see.

00:09:29.873 --> 00:09:31.877
I should have
some hand warmers in here.

00:09:31.943 --> 00:09:33.814
‐ [chimes ringing]
‐ Huh?

00:09:33.847 --> 00:09:36.051
Whoa, what are these things?

00:09:37.722 --> 00:09:39.024
‐ [laughs]

00:09:39.057 --> 00:09:40.961
Ah, what a lovely night.

00:09:40.995 --> 00:09:44.067
‐ According to Konton,
one of the Half‐Demon Princesses

00:09:44.134 --> 00:09:46.673
loses her demon powers
during a new moon.

00:09:46.706 --> 00:09:48.176
And guess what tonight is.

00:09:48.209 --> 00:09:52.384
This is the perfect opportunity
for me to have my revenge.

00:09:52.417 --> 00:09:55.724
Rainbow Pearl, lead me
to the Half‐Demon Princess

00:09:55.758 --> 00:09:57.194
affected by the new moon.

00:09:57.227 --> 00:09:58.897
[tone chimes]

00:09:59.999 --> 00:10:03.372
[laughs] Around there, huh?

00:10:03.406 --> 00:10:05.911
[tense music playing]

00:10:05.911 --> 00:10:06.913
‐ [sighs]

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:10.153
Those things
almost look like fireflies.

00:10:10.186 --> 00:10:12.090
[tones chiming]

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:17.400
Wait. Fireflies? In the winter?

00:10:17.434 --> 00:10:18.937
[tone chimes]

00:10:18.937 --> 00:10:21.275
‐ Well, I hope
they've been to your liking.

00:10:21.275 --> 00:10:23.714
‐ [gasps] Riku?

00:10:23.747 --> 00:10:26.252
‐ Good evening, Lady Towa.
Hope you've been well.

00:10:26.285 --> 00:10:27.922
Huh? My, oh, my.

00:10:27.955 --> 00:10:30.126
Is this true,
or do my eyes deceive me?

00:10:30.126 --> 00:10:31.897
Dear Lady Towa, I must say

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:33.934
you look
exceptionally beautiful tonight.

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:36.606
‐ Oh? You really think so?
[gasps]

00:10:36.673 --> 00:10:38.944
‐ Your left eye in particular

00:10:38.944 --> 00:10:41.783
holds a dark gentle glow
unlike any other.

00:10:41.783 --> 00:10:43.787
‐ [gasps]

00:10:43.787 --> 00:10:45.423
‐ It seems the Silver Pearl

00:10:45.456 --> 00:10:47.895
lies deeper within your eye
than expected.

00:10:47.929 --> 00:10:49.632
‐ Huh?
‐ [chuckles]

00:10:51.435 --> 00:10:53.072
<i>Just my luck.</i>

00:10:53.105 --> 00:10:55.978
<i>I guess retrieving it tonight</i>
<i>won't be an easy task.</i>

00:10:59.084 --> 00:11:00.988
[liquid pouring]

00:11:04.161 --> 00:11:05.330
[tone chimes]

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.334
[water bubbling]

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:08.971
‐ OK. The water's done boiling.

00:11:08.971 --> 00:11:10.908
‐ Thanks for the help.
That's pretty handy.

00:11:15.283 --> 00:11:18.222
Sorry. I just have one,
so we'll have to share.

00:11:18.256 --> 00:11:20.093
Alright, some black tea for you.

00:11:20.126 --> 00:11:21.428
It's brewed using a tea bag.

00:11:21.462 --> 00:11:23.834
‐ Thanks.
I can't wait to try it.

00:11:25.003 --> 00:11:26.338
[gasps] It's so good!

00:11:26.338 --> 00:11:28.977
I've never had
such delicious tea in my life.

00:11:29.011 --> 00:11:30.981
‐ It's Darjeeling.

00:11:31.015 --> 00:11:34.488
If I could choose, I actually
prefer Earl Grey more, but...

00:11:34.522 --> 00:11:36.458
this is good also.

00:11:36.492 --> 00:11:37.595
[sighs]

00:11:37.628 --> 00:11:39.364
I always thought fireflies

00:11:39.431 --> 00:11:41.335
were only around
during the summer months.

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:42.505
‐ You're right.

00:11:42.538 --> 00:11:45.276
You usually don't
see them in the wintertime.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.447
‐ [gasps] They disappeared.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.017
‐ It's said those who are loved

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:51.155
are fated to perish
in grace and beauty.

00:11:51.188 --> 00:11:54.194
‐ Huh?
‐ Quite fleeting, aren't they,

00:11:54.194 --> 00:11:56.332
the lives of fireflies.

00:11:56.365 --> 00:11:58.637
And so, too,
are the lives of humans.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.610
They can burn up
and waste away in an instant.

00:12:01.643 --> 00:12:05.383
But perhaps that's
what makes them so beautiful.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.287
‐ [gasps] Wow, Riku.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.157
I didn't know
you were so profound.

00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:11.896
‐ I likely picked it up
from my Madam.

00:12:11.963 --> 00:12:14.034
I recall she often spoke
in such a way.

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:16.038
‐ [gasps] Oh, wow!

00:12:16.105 --> 00:12:18.543
Look at all those stars
up there!

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:20.480
‐ This reminds me
of my former master.

00:12:20.514 --> 00:12:23.620
I always found him gazing
at the stars like this.

00:12:23.654 --> 00:12:26.058
TOWA: Really?
Sounds like your master

00:12:26.058 --> 00:12:27.327
must be quite the dreamer.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.999
RIKU: I don't know
so much about that.

00:12:30.033 --> 00:12:34.007
He does, however, hold a bit
of reverence for the sky.

00:12:34.041 --> 00:12:35.209
But right now,

00:12:35.243 --> 00:12:37.715
we both happen to have
our eyes on the same target,

00:12:37.748 --> 00:12:40.219
so I've decided
it's best to distance myself.

00:12:40.253 --> 00:12:43.259
‐ The same target, huh?
So what are you after, Riku?

00:12:43.259 --> 00:12:46.332
‐ I haven't told you yet?
The Rainbow Pearls, of course.

00:12:46.365 --> 00:12:48.035
‐ The Rainbow Pearls?

00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:49.539
‐ These here.

00:12:49.572 --> 00:12:51.543
There are seven in total.

00:12:51.576 --> 00:12:53.412
‐ You already have
almost half of them.

00:12:53.479 --> 00:12:55.149
What happens
if you gather them all?

00:12:55.183 --> 00:12:58.422
‐ Who knows? No one's ever
successfully brought together

00:12:58.489 --> 00:13:00.594
all seven
of the Rainbow Pearls before.

00:13:00.594 --> 00:13:03.332
I suppose it would
probably increase your power.

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:05.069
‐ Oh. Is that all?

00:13:05.103 --> 00:13:06.740
‐ [laughs]

00:13:06.773 --> 00:13:10.581
Or perhaps it could be used to
bring the next Degenerate Age.

00:13:10.614 --> 00:13:12.952
Who knows?

00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:15.289
But then again, one could argue

00:13:15.289 --> 00:13:17.528
that the world we live in
is already corrupted.

00:13:17.561 --> 00:13:19.431
‐ There must be a lot of demons

00:13:19.464 --> 00:13:21.302
who want to get their hands
on those things.

00:13:21.368 --> 00:13:24.074
We've been attacked for
our Pearls a few times already.

00:13:24.107 --> 00:13:26.011
‐ The truth is, these Pearls

00:13:26.045 --> 00:13:28.282
are the tears of the madam
who took care of me.

00:13:28.282 --> 00:13:31.723
‐ Those are her tears? So her
tears turned into those Pearls?

00:13:31.756 --> 00:13:34.962
‐ That's right. I want
to gather all seven of them

00:13:35.029 --> 00:13:37.635
so I can give them back to her,
their rightful owner.

00:13:37.635 --> 00:13:39.471
‐ Well, that's nice of you.

00:13:39.471 --> 00:13:41.576
[gasps] Hold on a second.

00:13:41.609 --> 00:13:43.312
Does that mean
you're after my Pearl,

00:13:43.312 --> 00:13:45.149
along with Setsuna
and Moroha's?

00:13:45.149 --> 00:13:47.555
‐ Looks like you got me.
The cat's out of the bag.

00:13:47.588 --> 00:13:50.159
Yes, I'm afraid that is correct.

00:13:50.159 --> 00:13:52.297
Just remain calm,
and I'll do what I can

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.334
to remove it
without hurting you, alright?

00:13:54.401 --> 00:13:56.138
[chuckles]

00:13:56.138 --> 00:13:58.142
TOTETSU:
There you are! [laughs]

00:13:58.209 --> 00:13:59.779
Get ready for Totetsu, 'cause...

00:13:59.812 --> 00:14:01.549
â™ª I'm gonna get you

00:14:01.583 --> 00:14:03.486
‐ What?! Totetsu?!

00:14:03.553 --> 00:14:05.724
‐ [scoffs] What an absolute
lack of good taste.

00:14:05.758 --> 00:14:07.561
[Towa grunts]

00:14:07.595 --> 00:14:08.730
[gasps]

00:14:08.764 --> 00:14:12.137
‐ What the‐‐Riku?
What are you doing here?

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:14.474
You should have just died
like a good little puppet.

00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:15.778
‐ You piece of shit.

00:14:15.811 --> 00:14:18.182
You've gone and ruined
my date with Lady Towa!

00:14:18.182 --> 00:14:19.685
I won't forgive you for this!

00:14:19.685 --> 00:14:23.794
‐ Oh, yeah? Well, the only ugly
piece of shit I see here is you!

00:14:23.827 --> 00:14:25.129
I'll gut you right here!

00:14:25.163 --> 00:14:27.367
‐ Riku!
‐ This is why I despise you.

00:14:27.434 --> 00:14:28.469
[tone chimes]

00:14:28.503 --> 00:14:31.008
‐ Fine! Bring it on!
‐ [grunts]

00:14:31.075 --> 00:14:34.481
[chuckles] I wonder what
a puppet like you tastes like.

00:14:34.515 --> 00:14:35.751
Sour? Bitter?

00:14:35.784 --> 00:14:39.458
Or maybe you and Lord Kirinmaru
share the same flavor.

00:14:39.491 --> 00:14:42.263
‐ What? Riku and Kirinmaru
would taste the same?

00:14:42.297 --> 00:14:44.167
‐ Don't you know how to shut
your filthy mouth?!

00:14:44.201 --> 00:14:46.506
‐ Guess I'll find out
by eating you!

00:14:46.539 --> 00:14:48.175
[grunts]

00:14:49.712 --> 00:14:51.315
‐ [grunts]
‐ [tone chimes]

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.323
‐ Eh?

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:58.395
[groans]

00:14:58.462 --> 00:14:59.565
‐ I'm not on the menu.

00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:01.736
Have some poison bees instead!

00:15:01.736 --> 00:15:03.540
‐ [grumbles]

00:15:03.607 --> 00:15:05.778
Damn pestilent miasma bugs.

00:15:05.811 --> 00:15:07.715
[gurgling]

00:15:09.819 --> 00:15:11.723
[yelling]

00:15:16.866 --> 00:15:17.735
[both grunt]

00:15:18.904 --> 00:15:20.239
‐ Are you OK?

00:15:20.239 --> 00:15:21.576
‐ Y‐Yeah, I think so.

00:15:21.643 --> 00:15:23.847
‐ [gurgles]

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.216
[exhales]

00:15:25.249 --> 00:15:26.485
[both gasp]

00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:28.590
‐ [grunts]
‐ Riku!

00:15:28.657 --> 00:15:30.159
‐ [groans]

00:15:30.193 --> 00:15:33.265
‐ Riku, just hang on.

00:15:36.806 --> 00:15:40.246
‐ [coughing]

00:15:40.313 --> 00:15:42.250
Damn you. [pants]

00:15:42.317 --> 00:15:44.421
[Riku gasping]

00:15:44.488 --> 00:15:45.757
‐ Are you OK?
‐ Yes.

00:15:45.824 --> 00:15:49.331
‐ Riku, how are you
and Kirinmaru connected?

00:15:49.364 --> 00:15:52.337
‐ Kirinmaru is the one
who used to be my master.

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:53.840
‐ Your master? Wait.

00:15:53.874 --> 00:15:56.546
You mean he's the dreamer
who likes to gaze at the stars?

00:15:56.579 --> 00:15:58.717
‐ Well, I suppose so, yes.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:02.290
Many years ago, he decided
to abandon me like trash.

00:16:02.357 --> 00:16:03.527
‐ That's awful.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.797
‐ And the only reason
I'm even still alive

00:16:05.797 --> 00:16:08.369
is because the madam
decided to take me in.

00:16:08.402 --> 00:16:09.705
‐ [retches]
‐ [gasps]

00:16:11.609 --> 00:16:14.114
‐ [gasps]
‐ The bleeding, it won't stop.

00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:15.216
‐ [coughs]

00:16:15.249 --> 00:16:16.385
Damn it.

00:16:16.418 --> 00:16:19.257
Miasma bug poison
is a real pain.

00:16:20.627 --> 00:16:21.796
‐ But I don't understand

00:16:21.863 --> 00:16:24.367
why you're risking your life
to help me like this.

00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:26.706
You know I'm Kirinmaru's enemy,
don't you?

00:16:26.739 --> 00:16:29.211
‐ [sighs] I do wonder.

00:16:29.244 --> 00:16:31.749
To be honest,
I don't understand it myself.

00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:35.323
There's really no logical reason
for me to protect you.

00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:36.826
‐ [gasps]

00:16:36.826 --> 00:16:40.233
‐ On the contrary,
if what I feel is love,

00:16:40.266 --> 00:16:42.571
I should simply
be able to kill you.

00:16:42.605 --> 00:16:44.909
But maybe I don't have
enough love for that yet.

00:16:44.942 --> 00:16:46.311
‐ [gasps]

00:16:46.311 --> 00:16:48.550
‐ I'm not any good at this.

00:16:48.583 --> 00:16:52.423
Understanding love is far beyond
a mere puppet like me.

00:16:52.457 --> 00:16:53.894
‐ [winces]
‐ Hang in there.

00:16:53.927 --> 00:16:57.433
You're not the only one.
Romance goes over my head, too.

00:16:57.467 --> 00:16:59.839
Then again, if it's like
having friends and family,

00:16:59.906 --> 00:17:00.841
then I think I get it.

00:17:00.908 --> 00:17:02.443
‐ [whoosh]
‐ [gasps]

00:17:02.477 --> 00:17:03.680
‐ This way!
‐ [yelps]

00:17:05.449 --> 00:17:06.418
‐ [grunts]

00:17:06.451 --> 00:17:07.521
[dramatic music playing]

00:17:07.521 --> 00:17:10.359
‐ [grunting]

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:11.829
Are you OK, Riku?

00:17:11.863 --> 00:17:14.434
Lady Towa, please save yourself.

00:17:14.467 --> 00:17:15.637
‐ [growls]

00:17:15.671 --> 00:17:18.510
You rejected puppet!
Your treachery knows no end!

00:17:18.577 --> 00:17:22.450
You've betrayed Lady Zero,
Lord Kirinmaru, and me as well!

00:17:22.483 --> 00:17:25.691
We will never forgive you
for your traitorous actions!

00:17:25.757 --> 00:17:28.697
‐ Give me a break. I'm tired
of your tasteless rants!

00:17:28.697 --> 00:17:30.199
[grunts]

00:17:32.538 --> 00:17:33.873
MOROHA: Crimson Dragon Wave!

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.443
SETSUNA: Scourge of Swallows!

00:17:35.476 --> 00:17:37.715
‐ [dragon roars]
‐ TOTETSU: Huh?!

00:17:37.781 --> 00:17:38.783
[groans]

00:17:38.817 --> 00:17:40.721
‐ [yelps]

00:17:40.787 --> 00:17:41.956
‐ Huh‐‐[groans]

00:17:48.536 --> 00:17:49.639
‐ What the...

00:17:49.672 --> 00:17:51.375
‐ Towa!
‐ Are you OK?

00:17:51.441 --> 00:17:52.377
‐ Uh, yeah. Thanks.

00:17:52.443 --> 00:17:54.515
‐ Oh, my head. [growls]

00:17:54.548 --> 00:17:56.218
Damn those
Half‐Demon Princesses.

00:17:58.389 --> 00:18:00.661
‐ But jeez! You guys
took forever to get here!

00:18:00.694 --> 00:18:02.330
‐ What are you talking about?!

00:18:02.363 --> 00:18:04.401
We've been looking
all over for you!

00:18:04.401 --> 00:18:06.806
‐ Towa, didn't I tell you
not to wander off?

00:18:06.839 --> 00:18:08.910
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. [gasps]

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:13.252
Looks like the new moon's over.

00:18:13.319 --> 00:18:14.220
[gasps]

00:18:15.857 --> 00:18:16.759
[chuckles]

00:18:17.861 --> 00:18:20.767
OK, Totetsu
of the Four Perils.

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:22.705
Sorry, but there's
been a change of plans.

00:18:22.738 --> 00:18:24.575
‐ Yeah, we'll be taking
that head of yours.

00:18:24.642 --> 00:18:26.713
‐ I hope you're ready to die.

00:18:26.746 --> 00:18:28.482
‐ [growls]

00:18:28.516 --> 00:18:29.552
‐ [laughs] You're joking.

00:18:29.585 --> 00:18:31.488
I plan to live for a long time,

00:18:31.522 --> 00:18:32.758
a lot longer than you.

00:18:32.758 --> 00:18:33.927

00:18:37.333 --> 00:18:38.670
‐ [laughs]

00:18:38.703 --> 00:18:42.043
I'll swallow all three of you
pitiful half‐demons at once!

00:18:42.076 --> 00:18:43.412
[tone chimes]

00:18:43.445 --> 00:18:44.782

00:18:44.782 --> 00:18:46.586

[gasping]

00:18:54.735 --> 00:18:57.574
‐ My rule is to only kill
the ones I love.

00:18:57.608 --> 00:18:59.879
However...

00:18:59.912 --> 00:19:03.687
for you, I'll make
an unfortunate exception.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.889

00:19:04.922 --> 00:19:05.957

‐ [gasps]
‐ [sighs]

00:19:08.697 --> 00:19:10.901
I'm so glad you're OK,
Lady Towa.

00:19:10.934 --> 00:19:13.940
You don't know how scared I was
that I might lose you.

00:19:15.042 --> 00:19:16.311
‐ Let her go.

00:19:16.378 --> 00:19:18.616
You and Kirinmaru
share the same scent.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:20.386
‐ What's this?

00:19:20.419 --> 00:19:22.825
Another tasteless comment
made at my expense?

00:19:22.825 --> 00:19:24.060
[scoffs]

00:19:25.597 --> 00:19:26.566

00:19:29.772 --> 00:19:31.041
TOWA: Riku!

00:19:31.074 --> 00:19:32.778
‐ Hmm?

00:19:32.811 --> 00:19:34.582
‐ I may not
know much about love,

00:19:34.615 --> 00:19:36.652
but I do know
what it means to like someone!

00:19:36.652 --> 00:19:39.391
And you, Riku,
are definitely someone I like.

00:19:39.424 --> 00:19:40.393
‐ Huh?

00:19:40.426 --> 00:19:41.495
‐ [laughs]

00:19:41.495 --> 00:19:43.399

00:19:44.668 --> 00:19:46.506
‐ Huh?!
‐ [gasps]

00:19:46.572 --> 00:19:47.473
This is...

00:19:48.643 --> 00:19:50.079
the Silver Pearl?!

00:19:50.112 --> 00:19:51.516
[gasps]

00:19:51.582 --> 00:19:52.518
Lady Towa.

00:19:52.584 --> 00:19:54.020
‐ [laughs]

00:19:54.087 --> 00:19:56.491
‐ [chuckles]

00:19:56.526 --> 00:19:57.928
You have once again demonstrated

00:19:57.961 --> 00:19:59.865
that your taste
is truly impeccable.

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:02.036
‐ Give my regards
to that madam of yours, yeah?

00:20:02.103 --> 00:20:03.573
In the meantime,

00:20:03.606 --> 00:20:05.577
could you please overlook
Setsuna and Moroha's Pearls?

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:07.413
‐ [laughs]

00:20:07.447 --> 00:20:09.451
You're a strange person,
Lady Towa.

00:20:09.484 --> 00:20:12.423
‐ Uh, really? You think so?
Well, if you ask me,

00:20:12.457 --> 00:20:14.127
you're a pretty
strange one yourself.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.534
‐ Well, I am only an imitation
of a living being at best.

00:20:17.601 --> 00:20:18.770
‐ An imitation?

00:20:18.803 --> 00:20:20.473
‐ Yes.

00:20:20.507 --> 00:20:22.043
‐ [laughs]
‐ Eh?

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:23.813
‐ So what if you're not perfect?

00:20:23.847 --> 00:20:25.182
Look at me. I'm a half‐demon,

00:20:25.216 --> 00:20:27.721
but that doesn't change me
from being who I am.

00:20:27.721 --> 00:20:29.190
That goes for you, too, Riku.

00:20:29.224 --> 00:20:32.865
So it's OK to be who I am?

00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:36.138
For an abandoned puppet like me,
those words are too kind.

00:20:36.171 --> 00:20:38.475
Lady Towa,
I can't thank you enough

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:40.012
for giving me
your Rainbow Pearl.

00:20:40.045 --> 00:20:42.684
If fate allows it,
we shall soon meet again!

00:20:44.053 --> 00:20:45.389
[footsteps approaching]

00:20:45.456 --> 00:20:46.826
‐ MOROHA: Seriously?!
‐ Hmm?

00:20:46.859 --> 00:20:48.730
‐ I don't believe it.
You just handed over

00:20:48.797 --> 00:20:51.134
your treasured Pearl
like it was nothing?

00:20:51.168 --> 00:20:53.138
Speaking of treasure‐‐[laughs]

00:20:53.172 --> 00:20:55.476
I wonder if I can
take Totetsu's head.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:56.579
If so, then Mr. Riku

00:20:56.646 --> 00:20:59.150
might actually be
a decent fellow after all.

00:20:59.184 --> 00:21:00.987
‐ [roars]
‐ [gasps]

00:21:01.021 --> 00:21:02.758

00:21:02.758 --> 00:21:04.862
‐ [groans]

00:21:04.895 --> 00:21:07.066
I'm going to devour you.

00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:09.170
‐ [laughs]
How are you gonna do that

00:21:09.204 --> 00:21:11.041
when you don't have
a stomach anymore?

00:21:11.074 --> 00:21:13.880
Now shut up,
and just die already. [giggles]

00:21:13.913 --> 00:21:16.752
Looks like I won't have to worry
about money for a while!

00:21:16.752 --> 00:21:17.888
‐ [chuckles]

00:21:17.921 --> 00:21:19.558
‐ Was that really a good idea,

00:21:19.592 --> 00:21:21.495
handing over
your Pearl like that?

00:21:21.529 --> 00:21:23.933
‐ The Silver Pearl
was mine to do what I want with.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.436
Besides, even without it...

00:21:26.606 --> 00:21:29.210
I still have enough demon power.

00:21:29.244 --> 00:21:30.780
‐ That's not what I meant.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:32.784
With those Rainbow Pearls
in hand,

00:21:32.851 --> 00:21:34.955
he'll have an immense amount
of demon power.

00:21:35.022 --> 00:21:36.626
‐ He's just going
to give them back

00:21:36.626 --> 00:21:37.895
to their rightful owner.
That's all.

00:21:37.928 --> 00:21:40.032
‐ Then we can only hope
that this rightful owner.

00:21:40.065 --> 00:21:42.036
doesn't go and use them
for something evil.

00:21:42.069 --> 00:21:43.873
‐ [gasps]
‐ Oh, yeah, that reminds me,

00:21:43.907 --> 00:21:46.579
wasn't Mr. Riku working
for Kirinmaru or something?

00:21:46.612 --> 00:21:47.915
‐ [yells]

00:21:47.948 --> 00:21:49.585
Hey, that's right!

‐ [gasps] Riku!
‐ [groans]

00:21:51.722 --> 00:21:53.526
‐ Wait up! I changed my mind!

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.897
Give me back my Silver Pearl!
Come on! Please!

00:21:55.931 --> 00:21:57.701
‐ Huh?

00:21:57.734 --> 00:22:00.105
[chuckles]

Wait!
