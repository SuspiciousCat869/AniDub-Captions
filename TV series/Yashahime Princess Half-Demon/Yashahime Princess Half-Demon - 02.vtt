00:10:13.866 --> 00:10:16.933
Tremble before
the bloodthirsty dawn!

00:10:16.966 --> 00:10:18.100
Uh...

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.066
Hey, looks like
you demon slayers

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.666
work with
an interesting companion.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.066
You're a half‐demon, aren't you?

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.000
Well, guess what. I'm a‐‐

00:10:27.033 --> 00:10:30.700
‐ Silence! You're going to die.

00:10:31.833 --> 00:10:33.833
‐ Kanemitsu no Tomoe, huh?

00:10:33.866 --> 00:10:36.233
Pretty fancy naginata
you got there.

00:10:36.266 --> 00:10:38.633
It's only fair,
if I win this match,

00:10:38.666 --> 00:10:40.566
that I get to keep it.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.666
‐ Setsuna, I'll back you up!

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.000
‐ That's not necessary.

00:10:44.033 --> 00:10:46.100
‐ Oh, so your name's Setsuna.

00:10:46.133 --> 00:10:48.966
[slurps] Alright.
I've made up my mind!

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.233
Sorry, Setsu,
but I'm taking your weapon!

00:10:54.366 --> 00:10:58.433
‐ Oh, wow. So you
actually saw through that?

00:10:58.466 --> 00:11:01.033
This might be fun
after all, Setsu!

00:11:01.066 --> 00:11:03.466
‐ [heart beats]
‐ [grunts]

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.200
[gasps]

00:11:04.233 --> 00:11:07.233
‐ Wait a sec. Are you kidding?

00:11:09.866 --> 00:11:10.800
I don't believe it.

00:11:10.833 --> 00:11:12.133
You have a Rainbow Pearl, too?

00:11:12.166 --> 00:11:13.766
‐ What are you talking about?

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.733
‐ [rumbling]
‐ Huh?

00:11:17.933 --> 00:11:23.166
‐ Give them to me!
Give me your Rainbow Pearls!

00:11:27.966 --> 00:11:31.200
‐ So that's the one
that attacked the village.

00:11:31.233 --> 00:11:33.433
Retreat!

00:11:33.466 --> 00:11:35.233
‐ Hand them over!

00:11:35.266 --> 00:11:37.800
I want those Rainbow Pearls!

00:11:37.833 --> 00:11:39.566
HISUI: Look out!

00:11:41.166 --> 00:11:43.233
Setsuna! You alright?

00:11:43.266 --> 00:11:45.033
‐ [gasps]

00:11:45.966 --> 00:11:48.033
‐ [chuckles]
Mistress Three‐Eyes!

00:11:48.066 --> 00:11:51.266
I knew you'd show yourself
sooner or later,

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.900
'cause you could
never resist this.

00:11:53.933 --> 00:11:55.233
‐ [laughs]

00:11:55.266 --> 00:11:57.266
There it is, the Red Pearl.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.200
‐ You're the one I've been

00:11:58.233 --> 00:11:59.866
sitting around here,
waiting for!

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.800
That bounty's mine.

00:12:01.833 --> 00:12:02.800
Say good night!

00:12:02.833 --> 00:12:03.900
‐ [clang]
‐ [laughs]

00:12:03.933 --> 00:12:05.866
‐ You're a bit tougher
than I thought,

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.366
which means new tactic!

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.033
[yells]

00:12:12.866 --> 00:12:13.966
Hey, demon slayers!

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.633
If you don't want
to get mixed up in this,

00:12:16.666 --> 00:12:17.800
better get lost.

00:12:17.833 --> 00:12:18.833
‐ Say what?

00:12:18.866 --> 00:12:19.933
‐ This way, Hisui.

00:12:19.966 --> 00:12:21.000
‐ Yes, sir.

00:12:21.033 --> 00:12:21.866
‐ Take this!

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.300
Heavenly Arrow Barrage!

00:12:24.866 --> 00:12:25.966
‐ [gasps]

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:26.833
[laughs]

00:12:26.866 --> 00:12:29.466
You missed, you fool. Uh...

00:12:32.833 --> 00:12:33.866
[grunting]

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.033
‐ Are those Sacred Arrows?

00:12:36.066 --> 00:12:38.933
KOHAKU: No, those are
the Arrows of Sealing.

00:12:38.966 --> 00:12:41.633
How could Beniyasha
have this spiritual power?

00:12:41.666 --> 00:12:44.066
‐ [laughing] I did it!

00:12:45.633 --> 00:12:46.766
‐ [grunts]

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.766
‐ [gasps] Huh?

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.466
What the hell?! Hey!

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.066
‐ [laughs]

00:12:58.900 --> 00:12:59.800
[hisses]

00:12:59.833 --> 00:13:01.233
I need more.

00:13:01.266 --> 00:13:03.700
I want the other Rainbow Pearl.

00:13:03.733 --> 00:13:05.900
Now give it to me! [hisses]

00:13:05.933 --> 00:13:07.866
Eh? There it is!

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:08.933
‐ Oh, no.

00:13:08.966 --> 00:13:10.233
‐ Hisui, try and
get Mistress Three‐Eyes

00:13:10.266 --> 00:13:12.833
to follow you
back to Lady Kaede's village.

00:13:12.866 --> 00:13:14.466
‐ You got it, Uncle!

00:13:15.933 --> 00:13:17.000
‐ Come back!

00:13:17.033 --> 00:13:18.100
‐ Damn you!

00:13:18.133 --> 00:13:21.000
Give me back my Red Pearl
right now!

00:13:21.033 --> 00:13:22.500
[school bell chimes]

00:13:22.533 --> 00:13:24.833
‐ Great. Thank you.
‐ There's a British proverb

00:13:24.866 --> 00:13:26.066
that goes like this.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.800
"When you find yourself in Rome,

00:13:27.833 --> 00:13:29.200
you should do as the Romans do."

00:13:29.233 --> 00:13:34.833
Which means, while visiting
an unfamiliar place, blend in.

00:13:34.866 --> 00:13:35.900
‐ Right.

00:13:35.933 --> 00:13:37.933
<i>I guess</i>
<i>I won't be staying too long</i>

00:13:37.966 --> 00:13:39.400
<i>at this school, either.</i>

00:13:39.433 --> 00:13:41.300
‐ While you are
attending this academy,

00:13:41.333 --> 00:13:44.333
perhaps try to conduct yourself
like the students here.

00:13:44.366 --> 00:13:47.900
Being tardy because you got
into a fight is unacceptable.

00:13:47.933 --> 00:13:50.766
<i>‐ And now I'm sure</i>
<i>he'll call my parents.</i>

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.400
‐ I will overlook this
for today,

00:13:53.433 --> 00:13:56.266
but please be more careful
in the future.

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:57.300
‐ Huh?!

00:13:57.333 --> 00:13:58.700
‐ That's all.

00:13:58.733 --> 00:14:00.000
You may go home now.

00:14:00.033 --> 00:14:01.166
‐ Really?!

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.833
‐ OK. See you tomorrow, Mei.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

00:14:04.866 --> 00:14:07.266
‐ Bye‐bye!
‐ Bye‐bye!

00:14:12.766 --> 00:14:15.466
[wind blowing]

00:14:17.066 --> 00:14:18.966
<i>‐ The moments</i>
<i>when I feel most at peace</i>

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.300
<i>are when I get to do this.</i>

00:14:22.333 --> 00:14:25.733
<i>The sword Kikujumonji,</i>
<i>a national treasure.</i>

00:14:25.766 --> 00:14:30.700
I heard it once belonged to
the shogun Yoshiteru Ashikaga.

00:14:30.733 --> 00:14:31.833
‐ [chime rings]
‐ [gasps]

00:14:31.866 --> 00:14:33.866
[sniffing] It's Mei.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:34.900
I can smell her crying.

00:14:34.933 --> 00:14:37.733
It's coming
from Grandpa's shrine!

00:14:37.766 --> 00:14:39.233
[Mei crying]

00:14:39.266 --> 00:14:41.333
‐ Hey, it's not that bad, kid.

00:14:41.366 --> 00:14:42.900
Your sister will be here soon.

00:14:42.933 --> 00:14:45.966
You can dry those eyes. [laughs]

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.133
‐ Hey, listen, Bro.

00:14:47.166 --> 00:14:49.933
Don't you think we're
going a little too far?

00:14:49.966 --> 00:14:51.133
‐ Come on, you idiots.

00:14:51.166 --> 00:14:54.100
If you want revenge,
you gotta go big or go home.

00:14:54.133 --> 00:14:56.800
Now don't you guys
go chickening out.

00:14:56.833 --> 00:14:58.033
‐ Ah, yes, sir!
‐ Yes, sir!

00:14:58.066 --> 00:15:01.066
TOWA: This world
is chock‐full of weak people,

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.166
<i>and because they're weak,</i>
<i>they band together</i>

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.066
<i>and pick on people weaker</i>
<i>than them to feel powerful.</i>

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.833
<i>I'm really sick of it.</i>

00:15:08.866 --> 00:15:10.766
‐ It's your lucky day, boys.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.900
That chick's
gonna learn her place

00:15:12.933 --> 00:15:14.600
for roughing up your gang.

00:15:14.633 --> 00:15:15.833
‐ Am I, really?
‐ [gasps]

00:15:15.866 --> 00:15:17.566
‐ Guess we'll see.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.900
‐ [muffled] Towa, you're here!

00:15:18.933 --> 00:15:21.266
‐ Mei, Grammy, Grandpa, hold on!

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.633
If you're looking for a lesson,
I'll be happy to help.

00:15:23.666 --> 00:15:28.000
But you guys are the ones who
are gonna get schooled today.

00:15:28.033 --> 00:15:29.933
‐ [laughs]

00:15:29.966 --> 00:15:30.900
Get her!

00:15:30.933 --> 00:15:33.166
[all yell]

00:15:38.566 --> 00:15:40.633
[groaning]

00:15:40.666 --> 00:15:41.733
‐ You're pretty good, honey.

00:15:41.766 --> 00:15:46.433
But I don't think you understand
the situation. Right?

00:15:48.866 --> 00:15:49.933
‐ [chuckles]

00:15:49.966 --> 00:15:50.866
[both gasp]

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.833
‐ Mei! [gasping]

00:15:52.866 --> 00:15:54.766
‐ I hope you
haven't forgotten the fact

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.566
that we've taken
a few hostages. Eh?

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.033
‐ If that's the game
you wanna play, fine.

00:16:02.066 --> 00:16:03.666
‐ Hey, is that thing real?

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.400
‐ Whether or not that sword
is real doesn't matter at all.

00:16:07.433 --> 00:16:10.800
If you even think about moving,
this is what'll happen.

00:16:10.833 --> 00:16:11.866
‐ [gasps]

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.533
‐ You wouldn't want
your cute sister

00:16:13.566 --> 00:16:16.700
to get a nasty scar
on her face, would you?

00:16:16.733 --> 00:16:19.733
Don't you dare move. Got it?

00:16:19.766 --> 00:16:21.166
What's wrong? Come on!

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.400
You said you were
going to school us, didn't you?

00:16:24.433 --> 00:16:26.400
‐ [groans]

00:16:27.933 --> 00:16:29.166
‐ <i>It's very important that you</i>

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.800
<i>don't use your powers</i>
<i>in front of other people.</i>

00:16:31.833 --> 00:16:34.766
<i>They have to be</i>
<i>our little secret.</i>

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.000
<i>Promise?</i>

00:16:36.033 --> 00:16:38.433
‐ <i>Mm‐hmm. I promise!</i>

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.133
<i>I'm sorry, Papa Sota.</i>

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:43.766
<i>Our promise,</i>

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.566
<i>I have to break it!</i>

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.800
‐ What?!

00:16:48.833 --> 00:16:49.900
‐ [gasps]

00:16:49.933 --> 00:16:51.633
[wails]

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.933
‐ You three
go hide somewhere safe.

00:16:57.966 --> 00:16:59.866
‐ Please don't fight them, Towa.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.933
‐ Don't worry.
I'll make it quick.

00:17:01.966 --> 00:17:02.800
‐ But, Towa!

00:17:02.833 --> 00:17:04.766
‐ What the hell is she?

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.800
‐ Not a human.

00:17:05.833 --> 00:17:07.800
‐ There's no way
we can take her down!

00:17:07.833 --> 00:17:09.733
‐ Get back here, cowards!

00:17:10.466 --> 00:17:11.133
‐ Damn freak.

00:17:11.166 --> 00:17:12.700
GRAMMY: Come on, Mei. Let's go.

00:17:12.733 --> 00:17:15.000
‐ Please,
you have to stop fighting!

00:17:15.033 --> 00:17:17.166
‐ It'll be fine.
I can handle this.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.800
Your big sister
is pretty strong, you know.

00:17:18.833 --> 00:17:21.933
‐ You can't!
I don't care if you're strong!

00:17:21.966 --> 00:17:23.733
If you keep doing
things like this,

00:17:23.766 --> 00:17:25.500
you'll never
stop fighting, ever!

00:17:25.533 --> 00:17:27.500
I know you'd rather
do cute and girly things

00:17:27.533 --> 00:17:29.433
instead of fighting
all the time, right?

00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:30.600
Come on! Admit it!

00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:31.466
‐ Uh...

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:32.700
um, to be honest, Mei,

00:17:32.733 --> 00:17:34.133
there's a part of me
that isn't ready

00:17:34.166 --> 00:17:36.166
to answer that question for you
just yet.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.166
‐ You're supposed to say yes,
even if you don't mean it!

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.366
‐ Sorry. I'm really sorry.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.900
‐ [wails] You're a dummy!
You know that?!

00:17:43.933 --> 00:17:45.800
‐ Huh?
‐ [crying]

00:17:45.833 --> 00:17:48.800
‐ [siren blaring]
‐ [gasps] The cops!

00:17:48.833 --> 00:17:50.833
‐ Who could have
called 'em on us?

00:17:50.866 --> 00:17:52.766
‐ Come on. We gotta bail!
‐ [growls]

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.333
[sirens blaring]

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.433
‐ [chuckles]

00:17:57.466 --> 00:18:01.333
Looks like those police
were only passing by.

00:18:01.366 --> 00:18:02.066
Fancy that.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.900
‐ You big dummy!

00:18:03.933 --> 00:18:06.766
You said you'd never
get into fights again!

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.433
‐ You're right.
Please forgive me, Mei.

‐ <i>Living in this world is hard.</i>

00:18:12.066 --> 00:18:13.933
If you don't live by the rules,

00:18:13.966 --> 00:18:16.466
you end up
getting treated as an outcast.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.766
Girls have to be feminine,
and boys have to be masculine.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:25.833
<i>I‐I'm just so sick</i>
<i>of that ideal.</i>

00:18:25.866 --> 00:18:28.600

<i>that I need to consider.</i>

00:18:28.633 --> 00:18:31.300
<i>I don't want to make Mei</i>

00:18:31.333 --> 00:18:33.833

‐ <i>This smell.</i>

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.766
How strange. It's nostalgic,

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.100
like I've smelled it before.

00:18:42.133 --> 00:18:46.000
But why is it coming from here?

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.800
‐ Give me the pearl! [laughs]

00:18:54.833 --> 00:18:56.933
‐ I think we drew it
far enough away.

00:18:56.966 --> 00:19:00.300
‐ Hisui, I'm getting off here.
‐ Are you serious?

00:19:00.333 --> 00:19:02.833
‐ It's following me
for the pearl in my right eye.

00:19:02.866 --> 00:19:05.833
‐ I'll use that to my advantage.
‐ Setsuna!

00:19:05.866 --> 00:19:10.300
‐ You can't escape! [laughs]

00:19:10.333 --> 00:19:11.533

How dare you?!

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.033
‐ I am Setsuna.

00:19:23.066 --> 00:19:25.766
These are the only words
I have for you‐‐

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.333
I am the reason
you will die tonight!

00:19:28.366 --> 00:19:29.166

00:19:32.233 --> 00:19:33.600
‐ What the‐‐You again?

00:19:33.633 --> 00:19:37.000
‐ Sorry, Setsuna.
I know you wanna take her down,

00:19:37.033 --> 00:19:38.933
but I got first dibs. Got it?

00:19:38.966 --> 00:19:40.433
‐ Ridiculous.
‐ Wha?!

00:19:40.466 --> 00:19:42.333
‐ [yells]
‐ [clang]

00:19:42.366 --> 00:19:43.466
[gasps] Damn it.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:49.133
‐ Come to me,
my lovely Gold Pearl.

00:19:49.166 --> 00:19:51.533

This is marvelous.

00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:02.766
‐ That bastard
absorbed the Gold Pearl, too!

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.166
The demon power
of the Rainbow Pearls

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.766
is already combining
with my own!

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.733
[laughing]

00:20:10.766 --> 00:20:12.766
‐ [groans] Can't break free.

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.500
‐ Heh. Looks like absorbing
the Red and Gold Rainbow Pearls

00:20:16.533 --> 00:20:18.566
has made old Three‐Eyes
even stronger now.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.833
Don't worry! I'll be right over
to get you out, Setsu!

00:20:22.866 --> 00:20:24.400
‐ Stop calling me that!

[Root Head growls]

00:20:26.433 --> 00:20:30.833
It's been a decade since I
sensed the Rainbow Pearl,

00:20:30.866 --> 00:20:32.833
and two of them are here!
‐ [gasps]

00:20:32.866 --> 00:20:35.066

00:20:57.033 --> 00:20:58.033
‐ I don't like it.

00:20:58.066 --> 00:21:00.633
‐ I know this smell. [gasps]

00:21:00.666 --> 00:21:01.600
Mei!

‐ [gasping]

00:21:05.966 --> 00:21:08.033
‐ Oh, my. How peculiar.

00:21:08.066 --> 00:21:10.166
‐ Towa, what is that thing?

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.366
‐ Wait. Is the smell...

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.066
getting stronger?

I remember. That's it!

00:21:29.566 --> 00:21:33.733
That unbelievably bright place
from my memories...

00:21:33.766 --> 00:21:36.100
and this smell.

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:37.900
TOWA: Setsuna!

00:21:37.933 --> 00:21:40.700
‐ What? Who could
be calling my name?

00:21:40.733 --> 00:21:43.600
‐ Damn it.
Why do I feel so weak?

00:21:43.633 --> 00:21:46.900
Is it 'cause I came through
the rainbow corridor?

00:21:46.933 --> 00:21:48.200
‐ [laughing]
‐ Eh?

00:21:48.233 --> 00:21:52.766

Everything is perfect.

The Silver Pearl
is here as well.

00:21:55.166 --> 00:22:00.033
Now I'll have a pearl for each
of my three beautiful eyes!

00:22:00.066 --> 00:22:03.466
