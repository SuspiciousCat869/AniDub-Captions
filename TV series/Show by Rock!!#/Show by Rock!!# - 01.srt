[MAPLE]
Oh, no!

476
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:51,000
The universe will be destroyed
by its accelerating expansion!

477
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:53,166
I mean, by an attack by
Sound Planet's greatest enemy,

478
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,583
the Queen of Darkness!

479
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:55,833
[MOA]
I'm starving!

480
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:58,041
What should I eat for
dinner tonight, pyuru?

481
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:00,875
[MAPLE] Moa, you're
just so. You're so Moa.
