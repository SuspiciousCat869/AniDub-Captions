Cyan, we should go, too.

[PEIPAIN]
Master Ailane!

168
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,541
Please, why won't
you talk to us?

169
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,041
Just tell us what's going on!

170
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,791
[AILANE]
I'm sorry.

171
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:39,000
All right fine, I'll tell you.
I'll tell you everything.

172
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,750
[AILANE]
I suppose you've figured it out,

173
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,958
but I have an older brother.

174
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,666
He was wise and noble,
and all of our relatives

175
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,958
had high hopes for his future.

176
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,958
I wanted to be just like him.

177
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:57,083
To me, and to others,
he could do no wrong.

178
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,583
What'cha think?

179
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,750
It's beautiful, Brother.

180
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,375
[AILANE]
As our father's successor,

181
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,166
he was made to study
how to be a good emperor,

182
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,666
and was expected to be
perfect in everything he did.

183
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,750
However, in time,

184
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,875
he was crushed by the
expectations and pressure.

185
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,208
Before long, music
became the only thing

186
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,666
that made him feel peaceful.

187
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,416
[knocking]

188
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,500
Hey...

189
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,791
[AILANE]
Then Father and our relatives

190
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:31,291
tried to take even that bit
of solace away from him.

191
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,291
They said he was a failure
as a successor.

192
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,625
[FATHER] This isn't how the next
head of the family should act!

193
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:40,250
What are you doing up here in
your room by yourself every day?

194
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,583

[FATHER]

That's what I wanna
do with my life!

197
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,791
Don't be ridiculous!

198
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,750
You don't understand
the position you're in?

199
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,250
Darling, take it easy,
that's enough.

200
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,208
[AILANE] Father couldn't
bear the disappointment.

201
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,916
He kicked my brother
out of the house.

202
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,541
[AILANE]
Big Brother.

203
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:11,291
Are you really
going to leave home?

00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,583
[AION]
Yeah.

205
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:17,500
Why won't you just beg
Father for forgiveness?

00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,416
[AION]
Listen.

207
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,791
I can't do anything
other than music.

208
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,833
I can't live up to
his expectations.

209
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,625
Music really means
that much to you?

210
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:32,958
More than your family?

211
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,500
Is it more important
to you than me?

212
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,583
I'm sorry.

215
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,083
[AILANE]
In time,

216
00:13:57,166 --> 00:14:00,958
Father decided to make me
the successor to the family.

217
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,250
My name is Peipain.

218
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:10,166

Well, I am called Ailane.

00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:28,833
I control the darkness
of this world.

223
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:33,083
And I think everyone
should just go to hell.

224
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,000
In the end, that course of anger

225
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:40,625
just led me to be
used by Dagger.

226
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:43,541
It's pathetic.

227

[CYAN] But that doesn't mean
you hate music, does it?

00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,250
What does it matter?

229
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:54,625
Well, I-I mean, after
hearing you play earlier,

Not just for yourself, but for
your bandmates and the world.

Look, I was unhappy.

I was so focused on finding
what I wanted out of life

that I ended up forcing all
the family matters onto you.

That was wrong.
