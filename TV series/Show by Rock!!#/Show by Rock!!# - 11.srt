[VICTORIOUS] All of a sudden

168

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,875
[VICTORIOUS]
And I like it...

I get it now...

171
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,916
This is the power of darkness
born from the seed of hatred.

172
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It gives me strength
I've never known before.

173
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,791
Darkness itself is power...

174

...and I'm filled with darkness!

[NARRATOR] The malice,
jealousy, and rage festering

in her heart had become
unspeakable power.

178
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:02,833
She now felt like pure darkness
was the one true power,

179
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:06,166
and tirelessly sought
only that henceforth.

180
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,916
It consumed her.

Keep going.
It's still not enough!

Delightful.

[CYAN]
As a group for the first time,

225
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,833
we'll write an amazing
song that shows

226
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,500
the strength of the love
we have for our bands,

What's the best way to start?

[CYAN] I've always loved
music and that love of music

to understand each other

through the language of music.

We might have arguments

That's right. Music.
