Let's join her and let her
people hear our music.

Yeah, now that I think about it,

00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,416
this is our first time
riding in it, Moa.

[MOA] In the past, Pyuruians

on this happy
little planet, pyuru.

227

Time marched on.

And even though they never
had any Melodisians,

229
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:22,208
the people prospered and
the economy grew like "whoa"!

230
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,500
[MOA] In no time,
Pyuruians found themselves

in an energy shortage!

232
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,125
So, in order to look
in to the energy use

233
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,833
and resources of other worlds,

234
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,166
they sent investigators

to different planets
across Sound Galaxy!

Wow.

That's a pretty important
mission, wouldn't you say?

So, since you were slacking
off on that mission,
