A girl's gotta have
her secrets, ya know?

Come on, you know
that's not what I mean.

161
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,041
Like everything is sups fine.

162

There's no problem at all.

Okay, bye!

[ROSIA]
No.

I can't get everyone
else involved.

[VICTORIOUS]
Yes, that's right.

168
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:51,666
You boys must keep winning
by whatever means necessary.

169
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,750
First, we raise your popularity.

170
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:58,041
Once that happens,
the world will be our oyster.

171

With your current
abilities and wealth,

172
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,458
it's only a matter of
time before ARACREFACT

173
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,083
will stand at the very top.

174
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:09,208
Your position in the music world
will become immovable.

175
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,875
Sounds good to me.

Did something happen?

N-No, of course not!

00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,541
Well, there's some
business I must attend to.

184
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,666
If you'll excuse me.

[ORION] You're late, Titan.
That's happened a lot lately.

You're not having any trouble

187

putting the new song
together, I hope.

No, I...

189
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:44,875
Anyway. So, what were you
all just talking about?

190
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,625
Oh, nothing important.

191
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,708
Just our strategy for
the upcoming rematch

192
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:51,000
against SHINGANCRIMSONZ.

193
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:54,250
What do you mean, "strategy"?

194
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,583
You aren't hiding something
from me, are you?

195
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,125
[ORION]
Funny you should ask.

196
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,375
I was curious if you
were keeping any secrets

197
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,958
from your band mates.

198

[gasps]

199
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,125
He's got a point, Titan.

200
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,375
You've been late more
and more often lately

201
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:14,208
and you never give us
a reason. Why is that?

202
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,250
Well, because...

203
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,000
[ARGON]
Aw, c'mon, guys.

204
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,625
Let's stop talking about
all this boring stuff.

205

It's practice time. Let's rock!

206

The more we sit around here,

207

the more my muscles slowly
turn into fat. Shyaa?

208
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,375
[ORION]
Yes, you're right.

209
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,791
[SELEN]
Agreed!

210
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,291
[RETOREE] Before,
everyone in SHINGAN seemed

211
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:43,083
really positive, so I
didn't wanna say anything.

212
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,750
But it's a completely
different story

213
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,375
if they're doing another
battle of the bands.

214
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,208
I won't let those guys
cheat 'em again!

215
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,583
Neither will I.

216

[RETOREE]
In order to stop them,

217
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,333
we need to get some
irrefutable proof!

218

Yeah!

Oh, by the way.

in the snacks over there,

Really? Yay! Thank you!

223
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,875
[CHUCHU]
I understand the situation.

00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,458
But, first, I wanna thank y'all.

For coming to talk to us!

227

It really means a lot!

I agree, pyuru!

No, really.
Thanks for listening.

230
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,500
It sounds like
she's worried that

231
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,875
if she talked to you
about whatever it is

232
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,958
that's bothering her,
all it would end up doing

233
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,833
is causing trouble
for the rest of y'all.

234
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,708
She's keeping things
to herself to protect us?

235
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,833
Rosia, that's totes whack.

236
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,458
She should be able to
talk to us about anything.

237
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,458
I know how you feel, pyuru.

238
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,166
[chuckles] How about
this. Try asking her

239
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,125
if everything's okay
one more time.

240
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,625
[GROUP]
Huh?

241
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,666
[CHUCHU] I'm sure she has
a reason for acting this way,

242
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,208
but with just a little push.

243
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,208
and asking her just
the right way,

244
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:51,166
you might find you
can resolve this.

245
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,416
I mean it.

246
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,291
We've learned that from
first-hand experience.

247
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:58,791
Just let her know how
you really feel, okay?

248
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,333
See, Rosia...

249
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:04,000
...doesn't like to lose and
hardly ever shows any weakness.

250
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,875
So, sometimes, I guess
we take advantage

251
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,333
of her mad determination.

252
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:10,708
Oh, Rosia. Just tell us
what's bothering you.

Right, we'll do it.

We'll try talking
to her one more time.

While Tsukino and I were
saving this exact table

for the rest of the band.

269
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,708

Yeah, 'member?

They said this table had
been reserved for them,

272
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,708
so they made us
get up and leave.

I was so surprised.

I accidentally dropped the
ice cream cone I was holding.

But then, you saw
what has happening

"reserved" crap!

I think you just made
that up to get your way!

280
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,541
But, more importantly,
you made my friend cry,

281
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,041
and I won't stand for that.

it's all right for you to
