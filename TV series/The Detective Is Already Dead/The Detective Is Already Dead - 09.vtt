the chance earlier.

That's just silly. You think
I could do something so cringey?

You know, one day,

[KIMIZUKA]
No! Don't!

00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:42.372 position:50% align:center
If you want a new heart,
I'll gladly give you mine!

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:44.749 position:50% align:center
Don't take hers, I beg you!

00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:47.252 position:50% align:center
Please, just leave her alone!

00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:49.587 position:50% align:center
I told you before, didn't I?

00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:52.799 position:50% align:center
Eventually, you'd
become my partner.

00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:56.761 position:50% align:center
Calm down. You have to
stay alive and well.

00:18:56.845 --> 00:18:57.846 position:50% align:center
Now...

00:18:57.929 --> 00:18:59.723 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA gasps]

00:19:02.976 --> 00:19:07.731 position:50% align:center
I'll take the legendary
detective's heart... for myself.

00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:12.360 position:50% align:center
[HEL]
Ah... That's it.

00:19:12.444 --> 00:19:15.405 position:50% align:center
I finally have a heart
worthy of this body.

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:18.074 position:50% align:center
With this, Father will know.

00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:22.120 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Give it back.

00:19:25.373 --> 00:19:28.168 position:50% align:center
That heart belongs to
Siesta, and no one else.

00:19:28.251 --> 00:19:30.295 position:50% align:center
You give it back, now!

00:19:30.378 --> 00:19:33.256 position:50% align:center
Oh. But that's
an impossible proposition.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.717 position:50% align:center
This fine heart--
it belongs to me.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.220 position:50% align:center
Don't you touch her!
Keep your filthy hands off!

00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:44.100 position:50% align:center
[HEL] Your fist is
powerless against me.

00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:45.810 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA gasps]

00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:52.359 position:50% align:center
What is the source
of this well of rage?

00:19:52.442 --> 00:19:53.735 position:50% align:center
Where did it come from?

00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:57.030 position:50% align:center
The spiritual bond
that the two of you shared.

00:19:57.113 --> 00:19:59.824 position:50% align:center
What were you
to her in this life?

00:19:59.908 --> 00:20:02.452 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA snarls]

00:20:03.411 --> 00:20:05.538 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Hel's asking was immaterial.

00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:08.249 position:50% align:center
I'd been thinking
about it all along.

00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:10.794 position:50% align:center
What on earth was I to Siesta?

00:20:10.877 --> 00:20:12.128 position:50% align:center
What did I mean to her?

00:20:12.212 --> 00:20:14.381 position:50% align:center
How did she feel about me?

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.718 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
And now...

00:20:18.802 --> 00:20:21.596 position:50% align:center
...at this point,
I'll never know the answer...

00:20:23.181 --> 00:20:24.391 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA sobs]

00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:28.019 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Nevertheless...

00:20:28.103 --> 00:20:32.982 position:50% align:center
...from the first day we met,
35,000 feet up in the air,

00:20:33.066 --> 00:20:36.361 position:50% align:center
we traveled together for
the best three years of my life.

00:20:36.444 --> 00:20:38.613 position:50% align:center
Though they were
anything but tranquil,

00:20:38.697 --> 00:20:41.199 position:50% align:center
and my life was in jeopardy
countless times.

00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:45.870 position:50% align:center
She denounced me as stupid,
put me in absurd situations...

00:20:45.954 --> 00:20:50.166 position:50% align:center
And yet, in the midst of those
thousand absurdities,

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.711 position:50% align:center
I laughed 10,000 times.

00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:56.423 position:50% align:center
Siesta and I both did...
together.

00:20:58.925 --> 00:21:00.593 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] You ask what
the relationship was

00:21:00.677 --> 00:21:03.638 position:50% align:center
between Siesta and me?

00:21:03.722 --> 00:21:06.975 position:50% align:center
You dare ask me to tell you
what I felt about her?!

00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:12.355 position:50% align:center
I could have told you
that from the beginning.

00:21:12.439 --> 00:21:13.857 position:50% align:center
She was everything to me!

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:17.569 position:50% align:center
More important to me than
anything in the entire world!

00:21:17.652 --> 00:21:18.820 position:50% align:center

00:21:27.245 --> 00:21:29.664 position:50% align:center
What... the...

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.050 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA whimpers]

00:21:47.307 --> 00:21:50.643 position:50% align:center

00:22:11.956 --> 00:22:13.917 position:50% align:center
What happened...?
