Kimizuka?

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.891 position:50% align:center
What you said yesterday,
it was the truth, wasn't it?

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:18.560 position:50% align:center
I mean, would you
even be here right now

00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:20.603 position:50% align:center
if you didn't believe me?

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.564 position:50% align:center
I guess that's a fair point.

00:00:22.647 --> 00:00:25.358 position:50% align:center
What's up? Is there
something bothering you?

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:27.277 position:50% align:center
Nothing in particular.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.989 position:50% align:center
I suppose I'm just feeling
a bit disappointed, is all.

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:32.699 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
About what?

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:35.201 position:50% align:center
Honestly? About the fact
that you're the one doing

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:37.370 position:50% align:center
all the actual work
on this case.

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:39.414 position:50% align:center
I'm the detective, aren't I?

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:42.042 position:50% align:center
That's just how
it goes sometimes.

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:45.670 position:50% align:center
I have no doubt you're going
to have to save me one day.

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:47.172 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Up until now,

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:50.133 position:50% align:center
that was a position I found
myself in pretty frequently.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.302 position:50% align:center
If I don't do some of the work,

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:54.971 position:50% align:center
that heart of yours
will get upset with me.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.017 position:50% align:center
Oh. The show's
about to get started.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.770 position:50% align:center
Okay. You're awfully
invested, aren't ya?

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:03.688 position:50% align:center
Listen, I explained this
to you yesterday.

00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:05.565 position:50% align:center
It's just part of the job 

00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:06.983 position:50% align:center
Sure, that's what you say,

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.527 position:50% align:center
but that was some
pretty realistic acting.

00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:11.905 position:50% align:center
You were downright creepy
yesterday, Kimizuka.

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:14.282 position:50% align:center
Uh, that last part
was unnecessary.

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.201 position:50% align:center
Nobody likes
being called creepy.

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:18.495 position:50% align:center
Especially by a classmate.

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:20.538 position:50% align:center
This isn't really
the time for small talk.

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:22.582 position:50% align:center
Can you hurry it up?

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:24.751 position:50% align:center
We have to get there
before she does Eighty-One.

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:27.295 position:50% align:center
I knew you were
obsessed, but wow.

How is it we said that
we needed back up,

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.977 position:50% align:center
but it's already
down to just us two?!

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:45.063 position:50% align:center
Yeah, unfortunately, we're just
going to have to make do

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:46.856 position:50% align:center
with the resources we have.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.900 position:50% align:center
The others are
already shorthanded.

00:01:48.983 --> 00:01:50.443 position:50% align:center
Can't have everything
we want, right?

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:51.986 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.030 position:50% align:center
So, the people you
mentioned earlier,

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.490 position:50% align:center
where do you think
they could be hiding?

00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:57.409 position:50% align:center
Do you really think
they're already here?

00:01:57.492 --> 00:01:59.077 position:50% align:center
Who knows?

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.913 position:50% align:center
It's possible they're some
hiding among the crowd,

00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:04.207 position:50% align:center
or it's also possible
they're hiding in the wings

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.167 position:50% align:center
like that guy was yesterday.

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:09.087 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI] Why'd you
even wear that jacket?!

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.506 position:50% align:center
You've gotta be
boiling alive in that thing.

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:14.217 position:50% align:center
Yeah. A little bit.

Whoo-whoo!

00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:41.119 position:50% align:center
That's not good. This is a lot
different from the rehearsal.

00:02:41.202 --> 00:02:43.872 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI] Hey! Shouldn't
we try to find our seats?

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:47.584 position:50% align:center
Uh, why would we have seats?
We don't even have tickets.

Oh.

C'mon, follow me.

We're going to the spot
we scouted yesterday.

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:54.382 position:50% align:center
Okay! Wait up!

Didn't you tell me she'd
sing a special song?

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:37.550 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:39.761 position:50% align:center
It should be after Eighty-One.

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:41.805 position:50% align:center
Ah, I think I understand now.

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:44.724 position:50% align:center
So yesterday's rehearsal
really was work related, huh?

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:47.143 position:50% align:center
Did you actually doubt me?

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.853 position:50% align:center
If anything is
gonna happen here,

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:51.106 position:50% align:center
it'll be during
"Sapphire Phantasm."

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.149 position:50% align:center
Now that everyone
is all fired up,

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.944 position:50% align:center
let's kick it up a notch!
Are you ready?!

[AUDIENCE cheering]

Here comes Eighty-One.

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:13.461 position:50% align:center
That's terrible,
you were looking forward

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:14.754 position:50% align:center
to Eighty-One so much!

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:16.673 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's not
why I'm worried!

[KIMIZUKA]
This is it.

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:40.864 position:50% align:center
Sapphire Phantasm
is her most popular song.

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:43.908 position:50% align:center
She always does something
special during the performance.

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:46.828 position:50% align:center
I bet that will be the trigger.
If I'm right...

00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:48.580 position:50% align:center
...the criminal's target
isn't actually the sapphire

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:49.873 position:50% align:center
in her vault.

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:53.001 position:50% align:center
They're actually targeting
Saikawa herself.

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:55.295 position:50% align:center
I have an idea on what
their motive might be.

00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:57.088 position:50% align:center
But there's no time to
check every place where

00:04:57.172 --> 00:04:59.132 position:50% align:center
the perpetrator
could be hiding.

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:03.178 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] For right now, I just
need to get close to Saikawa!

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:07.849 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Still though...

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:10.185 position:50% align:center
There's no guarantee
I'll be able to protect her.

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:12.479 position:50% align:center

the people behind this.

anything with these lights

I'm turning out

communicate in all this chaos.

I was utterly
enchanted by its beauty.

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:25.231 position:50% align:center
And thanks to my pretty new eye,
I began to have confidence

00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:27.609 position:50% align:center
in myself again.

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:31.446 position:50% align:center
It was around that time that
I started to work as an idol.

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:33.365 position:50% align:center
[My father and mother
were both delighted to see me

00:09:33.448 --> 00:09:36.326 position:50% align:center
acting so lively and happy.

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:38.995 position:50% align:center
So this is what
being alive feels like!

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:43.958 position:50% align:center
I suppose that might sound
stupid to some people.

00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:45.960 position:50% align:center
Those were my honest
thoughts, though.

00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:47.295 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI sighs]

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:50.965 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA]
But... my new, happy life

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:54.844 position:50% align:center
didn't last very long
before it all fell apart.

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:58.390 position:50% align:center
Three years ago,
when I was 11 years old,

00:09:58.473 --> 00:10:01.935 position:50% align:center
both my parents
died in an accident.

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:04.396 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA] In their will,
they left me a large house,

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:05.480 position:50% align:center
and their whole fortune,

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:07.565 position:50% align:center
which is an outrageous
amount of money.

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:11.611 position:50% align:center
And, of course, this--
my beautiful left eye.

00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:15.323 position:50% align:center
You see, this eye is
more important to me

00:10:15.407 --> 00:10:16.741 position:50% align:center
than anything else.

00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:18.159 position:50% align:center
Because of that, it was
something I wanted

00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:20.245 position:50% align:center
to keep close to my heart.

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:22.914 position:50% align:center
And that's why I
usually wear an eyepatch

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:25.208 position:50% align:center
when I'm around other people.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:28.169 position:50% align:center
But... during some of
my bigger performances,

00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:30.922 position:50% align:center
I decided I'd show it off
for just a moment.

00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:33.216 position:50% align:center
As a way to say "I'm here."

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:36.428 position:50% align:center
My hope was that my parents
could see it from Heaven.

00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:40.098 position:50% align:center
Still though. I never imagined
that this sort of thing

00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:44.310 position:50% align:center
would ever happen. That
criminals would target my eye?

00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:48.023 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA] You really are
an amazing detective.

00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:49.941 position:50% align:center
You saw right
through my secrets.

00:10:50.025 --> 00:10:51.985 position:50% align:center
You realized that I was
the criminal's true target,

00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:54.529 position:50% align:center
and then you put your life
on the line to save me.

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:58.158 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad.
I was right to choose you guys.

00:10:58.241 --> 00:11:01.911 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much! How can I
ever repay you for your help?

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:03.413 position:50% align:center
Uh, hey, that's enough.

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:06.124 position:50% align:center
Come on. Stop bowing.

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:09.836 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Yes. You could say
that was the ideal outcome.

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:12.881 position:50% align:center
Nobody was harmed,
the sapphire wasn't stolen,

00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:16.551 position:50% align:center
it was your classic happy ending
wrapped up with a big bow.

00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:18.553 position:50% align:center
With that, we probably
could have put

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:20.430 position:50% align:center
this situation behind us.

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:22.349 position:50% align:center
And a week ago,
I might've done just that.

00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:23.641 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI giggles]

00:11:23.725 --> 00:11:25.060 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
However...

00:11:25.143 --> 00:11:27.771 position:50% align:center
...I couldn't just keep
ignoring the truth.

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:31.149 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
So Saikawa.

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:32.734 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:34.611 position:50% align:center
Aren't you at all worried about
what's going to happen to you

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:37.906 position:50% align:center
since you failed your mission?
The one to kill us?

00:11:37.989 --> 00:11:39.616 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Huh...?

00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:52.087 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA]
Excuse me?

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.590 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but I'm not really sure
what you mean, Mister Assistant.

00:11:55.674 --> 00:11:57.133 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA grunts]

00:11:57.217 --> 00:11:58.968 position:50% align:center
Come on, why on earth
would an idol like me

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:00.845 position:50% align:center
want to kill anybody?

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:02.222 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:03.807 position:50% align:center
Maybe you should give up
the whole detective thing

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.767 position:50% align:center
and become a mystery writer.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:06.976 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA sighs]

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.104 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Come on, Kimizuka.

00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:11.523 position:50% align:center
Saikawa literally just poured
her heart and soul out to us,

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:12.941 position:50% align:center
and we know her secret!

00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:14.109 position:50% align:center
If there's anything beyond that,

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:17.237 position:50% align:center
you sure as heck didn't
tell me about it.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.865 position:50% align:center
True, she was kind enough to
reveal one of her secrets to us.

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:23.785 position:50% align:center
But she also hasn't
confessed her lie yet.

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:25.453 position:50% align:center
What lie?

00:12:25.537 --> 00:12:27.664 position:50% align:center
[phone rings]

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:30.667 position:50% align:center
Yeah, hello? Any updates?

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.627 position:50% align:center
[FUUBI]
We just wrapped things here.

00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:35.672 position:50% align:center
You really are a pain
in the neck sometimes.

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:37.257 position:50% align:center
It's exactly like you said.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.800 position:50% align:center
There was a timed
detonator rigged up

00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:40.385 position:50% align:center
to the sapphire's vault.

00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:43.430 position:50% align:center
I had the bomb squad
dismantle it.

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:45.181 position:50% align:center
That was a close call.

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:48.810 position:50% align:center
You just narrowly missed
being blown to pieces, kiddo.

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:52.188 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Ms. Fuubi.
I appreciate all your help.

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:54.024 position:50% align:center
Well, there you have it.

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:57.986 position:50% align:center
Uh... Hold on.

00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:59.571 position:50% align:center
I thought you told me
that the criminals were

00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:01.573 position:50% align:center
after Saikawa's left eye.

00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:03.825 position:50% align:center
So, why would they try
to blow up her house?

00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:06.536 position:50% align:center
Because there was obviously
more than one target.

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:09.873 position:50% align:center
The first one was
Saikawa's sapphire left eye.

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:11.833 position:50% align:center
But the other objective...

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:14.169 position:50% align:center
...was getting rid
of the two of us.

00:13:14.252 --> 00:13:16.463 position:50% align:center
Uh... What does this mean?

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:18.298 position:50% align:center
That Saikawa knew what
the criminal's plan was

00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:20.175 position:50% align:center
from the very beginning.

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:23.303 position:50% align:center
Yep. Everything she said
was all part of her plan

00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:25.472 position:50% align:center
to lure us to the vault.

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:28.058 position:50% align:center
There's no way!
Do you have proof?

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:30.226 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Ms. Fuubi said
she hadn't heard about it.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:31.644 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.355 position:50% align:center
About the advanced warning
letter that was delivered

00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:35.273 position:50% align:center
to Saikawa's home.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:40.153 position:50% align:center
The truth is she never
contacted the police at all.

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:42.113 position:50% align:center
She came straight to us.

00:13:42.197 --> 00:13:45.450 position:50% align:center
Because she needed us
for a specific purpose.

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:47.118 position:50% align:center
I just don't understand
why an idol

00:13:47.202 --> 00:13:48.745 position:50% align:center
would need to do that, though.

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:49.954 position:50% align:center
Wait, unless she's...

00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:53.917 position:50% align:center
No. I'm positive she
doesn't belong to SPES.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.794 position:50% align:center
But if I had to guess...

00:13:55.877 --> 00:13:58.213 position:50% align:center
...I'd say they definitely
threatened her.

00:13:58.296 --> 00:13:59.547 position:50% align:center
Probably something
like they'd take her eye

00:13:59.631 --> 00:14:02.008 position:50% align:center
if she didn't get rid of me.

00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:03.510 position:50% align:center
But you should know...

00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:05.428 position:50% align:center
...it was never
gonna be that simple.

00:14:05.512 --> 00:14:08.765 position:50% align:center
These people... They want
their cake and to eat it, too.

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:11.601 position:50% align:center
They wanted our lives
and your left eye.

00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:14.521 position:50% align:center
Actually... I don't
think they wanted it

00:14:14.604 --> 00:14:17.899 position:50% align:center
so much as they just wanted
to destroy it completely.

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:19.359 position:50% align:center
That doesn't make any sense--

00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:21.403 position:50% align:center
Why would they care
about her false eye?

00:14:21.486 --> 00:14:23.113 position:50% align:center
'Cause there's
something more to it.

00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:26.825 position:50% align:center
It's not just an artificial eye;
that's why SPES got involved.

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:29.703 position:50% align:center
It's probably very
similar to Bat's ear.

00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:31.287 position:50% align:center
To his ear?

00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:35.875 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's ability... is that it
can see through any object.

00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:39.045 position:50% align:center
It's basically like x-ray
vision. Isn't that right,

00:14:39.129 --> 00:14:40.630 position:50% align:center
Saikawa?

00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:45.010 position:50% align:center
No need to be shy.
Just tell us what you can see.

00:14:47.679 --> 00:14:49.472 position:50% align:center
Is that for self-defense?

00:14:49.556 --> 00:14:50.932 position:50% align:center
That's an idol for you.

00:14:51.016 --> 00:14:53.018 position:50% align:center
Able to act so calm and innocent
even though you knew

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:54.769 position:50% align:center
what I was packing.

00:14:55.979 --> 00:14:57.355 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA grunts]

00:14:57.439 --> 00:14:59.149 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Uh...

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:01.484 position:50% align:center
Guys? What's going on here?

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:04.195 position:50% align:center
I will never give
my left eye to you.

00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:06.239 position:50% align:center
--I get it now.
--Huh?

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:08.366 position:50% align:center
SPES obviously lied to her.

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.494 position:50% align:center
They made her believe that
we wanted to steal the sapphire.

00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:14.497 position:50% align:center
So she was thinking
that we're the enemy.

00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:16.750 position:50% align:center
Then they proposed
a way to help her

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:19.502 position:50% align:center
by giving her a
way to take us out.

00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:21.004 position:50% align:center
How sick.

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:23.465 position:50% align:center
I can't believe they'd stoop
so low as to give you a gun.

00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:27.302 position:50% align:center
They didn't.
I bought this myself.

00:15:27.385 --> 00:15:29.971 position:50% align:center
So how'd you know about my eye?

00:15:30.055 --> 00:15:32.724 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Ordinarily, a person
who only has sight in one eye

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:35.810 position:50% align:center
has a decreased field of vision,
along with a more difficult time

00:15:35.894 --> 00:15:37.771 position:50% align:center
gauging the distance of things.

00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:40.315 position:50% align:center
You, on the other hand, were
able to move around freely

00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:42.192 position:50% align:center
without any noticeable
impairments,

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:44.402 position:50% align:center
despite wearing an eyepatch.

00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:45.904 position:50% align:center
The truth comes out.

00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:48.448 position:50% align:center
You know, I get the feeling
you never really trusted me,

00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:49.699 position:50% align:center
did you?

00:15:49.783 --> 00:15:51.826 position:50% align:center
I was genuinely fooled
for a moment, though.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.162 position:50% align:center
When you asked to
come to my rehearsal.

00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:56.581 position:50% align:center
You thought I was
a hardcore Yui-nya fan.

00:15:56.664 --> 00:16:00.210 position:50% align:center
Yep. I was all but certain I had
captivated you with my charms.

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:02.295 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA chuckles]
Well...

00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:04.673 position:50% align:center
To be fair, even Natsunagi
thought that.

00:16:04.756 --> 00:16:07.175 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA] So yesterday,
the man who attacked me?

00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:09.636 position:50% align:center
The one at my rehearsal--
you arranged it, too?

00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:12.806 position:50% align:center
Perceptive. When a person
thinks they're in danger,

00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:15.392 position:50% align:center
they're forced to
react instinctively.

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:17.769 position:50% align:center
That sounds like
an awful amount of hard work.

00:16:17.852 --> 00:16:20.146 position:50% align:center
You did that just
to test a theory?

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.400 position:50% align:center
It's the training
from my old partner.

00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:24.901 position:50% align:center
So is this it, then?

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:26.986 position:50% align:center
Are all our cards
now on the table?

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:30.990 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. It seems you know
everything, Mister Assistant.

00:16:31.074 --> 00:16:33.326 position:50% align:center
Then there's only
one thing left to do.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.829 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna need you
to lower you gun.

00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:37.664 position:50% align:center
I can't, though.

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:39.499 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Yes, you can.

00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:41.918 position:50% align:center
Think carefully about
what happened up on stage.

00:16:42.002 --> 00:16:43.336 position:50% align:center
If I hadn't been there for you,

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.755 position:50% align:center
then that crossbow would
have hit you right in the eye.

00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:48.216 position:50% align:center
If I were truly the enemy
you believed me to be,

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:51.219 position:50% align:center
why would I waste
my time saving you?

00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:52.721 position:50% align:center
I don't know...

00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:55.223 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Listen to me, Saikawa.

00:16:55.306 --> 00:16:57.684 position:50% align:center
Murdering us
won't solve anything.

00:16:57.767 --> 00:17:00.603 position:50% align:center
Even if you succeed, there will
still be enemies out there

00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:02.188 position:50% align:center
who are after your fake eye.

00:17:02.272 --> 00:17:05.191 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA growls]
It's not that simple!

00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:06.651 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA gasps]

00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:13.241 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA]
Honestly...

00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:14.993 position:50% align:center
...I already know...

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:17.412 position:50% align:center
Deep down, I know the truth...

00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:22.334 position:50% align:center
And I understand the two of
you aren't my real enemy.

00:17:22.417 --> 00:17:23.835 position:50% align:center
--[gasps]
--[SAIKAWA] But...

00:17:23.918 --> 00:17:27.047 position:50% align:center
I'm scared! How do
I keep my eye safe

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.924 position:50% align:center
from the people
who want it so badly?!

00:17:32.969 --> 00:17:34.512 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA]
I can't do this...

00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:36.806 position:50% align:center
My father and mother
are both gone...

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:39.225 position:50% align:center
And if I lost the eye
they gave me, too...

00:17:39.309 --> 00:17:42.270 position:50% align:center
[sobs] ...I don't think
I could bear it.

00:17:43.646 --> 00:17:45.190 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
It's a shame.

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:47.692 position:50% align:center
I want to tell her that
things will work out,

00:17:47.776 --> 00:17:50.945 position:50% align:center
but empty words
won't save this girl.

00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:54.032 position:50% align:center
She's forged ahead desperately
as an idol amidst the darkness,

00:17:54.115 --> 00:17:58.912 position:50% align:center
and is fighting alone, even now,
with a gun clenched in her hand.

00:17:58.995 --> 00:18:00.163 position:50% align:center
So, what then?

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:01.790 position:50% align:center
What can we do to help her?

00:18:01.873 --> 00:18:03.833 position:50% align:center
Especially when it's obvious
that there's only one thing

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:05.960 position:50% align:center
she really wants.

00:18:06.044 --> 00:18:08.630 position:50% align:center
This is random, but once
this case is done,

00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:10.924 position:50% align:center
we're thinking of going
to the beach together.

00:18:11.007 --> 00:18:12.342 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:12.425 --> 00:18:14.928 position:50% align:center
It'll be fun! But I think
it would be even more fun

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:17.472 position:50% align:center
if you decided to
come along, Saikawa.

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:19.224 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA grunts]

00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:20.767 position:50% align:center
I'm not great at this.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:23.061 position:50% align:center
But I guess what I'm
trying to say here is...

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:26.147 position:50% align:center
...how do you feel about
being friends with me?

00:18:26.231 --> 00:18:28.108 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:18:28.191 --> 00:18:29.401 position:50% align:center
I don't get it...

00:18:29.484 --> 00:18:32.612 position:50% align:center
I plotted to murder
the two of you, remember?

00:18:32.696 --> 00:18:34.030 position:50% align:center
It was for a good reason.

00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:36.950 position:50% align:center
Besides, we don't die that
easily, right, Kimizuka?

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:39.077 position:50% align:center
Uh. Are you serious?

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.288 position:50% align:center
I don't think I deserve
to be your friend at all!

00:18:42.372 --> 00:18:44.666 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI] I'm the one
who gets to decide that.

00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:45.875 position:50% align:center
But I...

00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:47.460 position:50% align:center
I can't.

00:18:47.544 --> 00:18:50.588 position:50% align:center
I'm capable of choosing my own
friends, and you're my choice.

00:18:50.672 --> 00:18:52.424 position:50% align:center
Me?

00:18:52.507 --> 00:18:54.092 position:50% align:center
So please, just do me a favor.

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:56.261 position:50% align:center
Say yes, Saikawa.

00:18:56.344 --> 00:18:58.013 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA gasps]

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.849 position:50% align:center
This isn't normal...

00:19:00.932 --> 00:19:04.102 position:50% align:center
You do know that, right?
It's kinda weird.

00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:06.771 position:50% align:center
Is it? Well, maybe
I prefer it that way,

00:19:06.855 --> 00:19:08.982 position:50% align:center
'cause having a normal
friend would be boring.

00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:11.026 position:50% align:center
Things will be a lot
more fun like this.

00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:14.988 position:50% align:center
Okay, but... even if we did
actually become friends...

00:19:15.071 --> 00:19:17.365 position:50% align:center
...it's not like that
would fix my problems.

00:19:17.449 --> 00:19:19.492 position:50% align:center
If anything, I'd just end up
causing you more trouble

00:19:19.576 --> 00:19:21.411 position:50% align:center
than I already have.

00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:23.538 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
I seriously doubt that.

00:19:25.248 --> 00:19:26.833 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA gasps]

00:19:26.916 --> 00:19:28.251 position:50% align:center
Listen, Saikawa.

00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:29.961 position:50% align:center
You've got some scary
people targeting you,

00:19:30.045 --> 00:19:32.881 position:50% align:center
but they're also after me.
So we're in this together.

00:19:32.964 --> 00:19:34.966 position:50% align:center
And you wouldn't
cause us more trouble.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.010 position:50% align:center
You're teaming up
with a fellow target.

00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:40.889 position:50% align:center
Just think of it as forming an
alliance against a common enemy.

00:19:40.972 --> 00:19:42.766 position:50% align:center
You're going to help me...?

00:19:42.849 --> 00:19:44.100 position:50% align:center
You promise?

00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:46.936 position:50% align:center
I promise.
We'd love to help you.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.813 position:50% align:center
What do you say, Saikawa?

00:19:48.897 --> 00:19:51.941 position:50% align:center
Join us, and then we can be
there to help each other out.

00:19:52.025 --> 00:19:53.943 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA gasps]

00:19:54.027 --> 00:19:55.904 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]

00:19:58.615 --> 00:19:59.741 position:50% align:center
Okay...

00:19:59.824 --> 00:20:01.618 position:50% align:center
Yes, I would love to!

00:21:41.217 --> 00:21:42.510 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:48.516 --> 00:21:50.101 position:50% align:center
[GIRL]
Mom...

00:21:53.104 --> 00:21:54.647 position:50% align:center
[GIRL] Mom! Why do
I have to partner up

00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:57.275 position:50% align:center
with a dumb guy like him?

00:21:57.359 --> 00:21:59.569 position:50% align:center
I would rather throw myself
into the ocean right this minute

00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:01.571 position:50% align:center
than partner up with Kimizuka!

00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:03.990 position:50% align:center
Cool, I'll hold onto your
valuables if you want.

00:22:04.074 --> 00:22:06.409 position:50% align:center
[GIRL growls] Shut up!
I was supposed to be

00:22:06.493 --> 00:22:08.995 position:50% align:center
Mom's top apprentice!

00:22:09.079 --> 00:22:11.331 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] It's a temporary
arrangement. Okay?

00:22:11.414 --> 00:22:14.250 position:50% align:center
--[gasps]
--Please come here.

00:22:14.334 --> 00:22:16.127 position:50% align:center
Yes, Mom!
[laughs]

00:22:16.211 --> 00:22:18.129 position:50% align:center
That's a good girl.

00:22:18.213 --> 00:22:20.548 position:50% align:center
[GIRL giggles]

00:22:20.632 --> 00:22:21.883 position:50% align:center
Hmph.

00:22:21.966 --> 00:22:24.427 position:50% align:center
Yeah, okay, whatever.
I'm not jealous.

00:22:24.511 --> 00:22:25.679 position:50% align:center
Know what I want?

00:22:25.762 --> 00:22:28.181 position:50% align:center
For the two of you
to get along a bit better.

00:22:28.264 --> 00:22:29.641 position:50% align:center
[GIRL chuckles]

00:22:29.724 --> 00:22:32.185 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] It would certainly
make things easier for me.

00:22:32.268 --> 00:22:34.437 position:50% align:center
Hold on just a minute, I still
haven't agreed to even work

00:22:34.521 --> 00:22:36.731 position:50% align:center
with that stupid jerk, yet!

00:22:36.815 --> 00:22:40.485 position:50% align:center
Listen. Alone, the two of you
are far from perfect.

00:22:40.568 --> 00:22:43.071 position:50% align:center
For example, my sidekick
here is pretty clever,

00:22:43.154 --> 00:22:44.781 position:50% align:center
but unfortunately,
has the physical prowess

00:22:44.864 --> 00:22:46.116 position:50% align:center
of a water flea.

00:22:46.199 --> 00:22:48.118 position:50% align:center
Fighting is definitely
not his forte.

00:22:48.201 --> 00:22:50.704 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
Well, that's flattering.

00:22:50.787 --> 00:22:52.205 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:22:52.288 --> 00:22:55.291 position:50% align:center
And you. You're incredible
in terms of fighting ability,

00:22:55.375 --> 00:22:56.835 position:50% align:center
but you're not exactly
the brightest crayon

00:22:56.918 --> 00:22:58.003 position:50% align:center
in the box, you know.

00:22:58.086 --> 00:22:59.379 position:50% align:center
What'd you say?!

00:22:59.462 --> 00:23:00.588 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA chuckles]

00:23:00.672 --> 00:23:01.881 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:23:01.965 --> 00:23:04.926 position:50% align:center
So that is why...
I want you to work together.

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:07.470 position:50% align:center
So you'll compensate
for each other's weaknesses.

00:23:07.554 --> 00:23:09.472 position:50% align:center
Then you can
overcome any challenge.

00:23:09.556 --> 00:23:12.434 position:50% align:center
But if we do that, we'd be
leaving you all alone, Mom.

00:23:12.517 --> 00:23:14.644 position:50% align:center
You really underestimate me.

00:23:14.728 --> 00:23:17.772 position:50% align:center
Come on now, I'm ten times
the fighter you are,

00:23:17.856 --> 00:23:20.608 position:50% align:center
and I've got a hundred times
more brainpower than him.

00:23:20.692 --> 00:23:22.902 position:50% align:center
So I'll be fine,
there's no need to worry.

00:23:22.986 --> 00:23:24.654 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA sighs]
Not to complain,

00:23:24.738 --> 00:23:27.115 position:50% align:center
but why'd you make
my brainpower so low?

00:23:27.198 --> 00:23:30.035 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA sighs]

00:23:30.118 --> 00:23:33.455 position:50% align:center
So. I need you to promise me.

00:23:33.538 --> 00:23:35.874 position:50% align:center
You two need to get along
in the future.

00:23:35.957 --> 00:23:36.958 position:50% align:center
Can you do that?

00:23:37.042 --> 00:23:39.461 position:50% align:center
For the long haul?

00:23:39.544 --> 00:23:41.671 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
That was the day...

00:23:41.755 --> 00:23:44.174 position:50% align:center
...the legendary
detective died.
