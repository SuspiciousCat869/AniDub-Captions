In fact, I was certain of it.

That's why I wanted to have said
my goodbyes on that boat,

I am sorry.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.096 position:50% align:center
I ran you around so hard.

[SIESTA] I wish I could have
more chances to hear you say,

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.311 position:50% align:center
"This is so absurd,"
and see that look

I didn't... want to die.

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:25.210 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] And yet...
I promised you that time,

that whatever incidents, or
problems you got tangled up in,

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:33.009 position:50% align:center

even though
I'll be gone by then.

But it's okay.

00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:55.490 position:50% align:center
I have no doubt she'll protect
you, maybe even better than me.

00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:59.786 position:50% align:center
Also... I know she'll
take you in her arms,

that one time.

I never gave this to her, did I?

[SIESTA]
Hmm.

00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:13.842 position:50% align:center
I need to think of a name.

A new name for this body,
in its rebirth

Hel's consciousness.

No, not really, I'm just
borrowing her body

00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:16.598 position:50% align:center
But, before I knew it,
three years had gone by.

00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:19.601 position:50% align:center
My guess is... I found that
I was fonder of you

00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:21.978 position:50% align:center
than I ever imagined I would be.

00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:25.357 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA ] Of course you were,
but it's not like you and I

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.985 position:50% align:center
were lovers. When you get down
to it, we weren't even friends.

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:31.780 position:50% align:center
Detective and sidekick,
that's all we were--

00:09:31.863 --> 00:09:33.865 position:50% align:center
bizarre business partners.

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:36.993 position:50% align:center
I realize that. You didn't think
of me in a romantic way--

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:38.787 position:50% align:center
it was never really about that.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.205 position:50% align:center
And I didn't really
give you any sort of

00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:42.207 position:50% align:center
special treatment, either.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.001 position:50% align:center
And yet...

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:47.379 position:50% align:center
Those three short years--
the dizzying times

00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:49.255 position:50% align:center
you and I had together.

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:53.218 position:50% align:center
They were the best of my life,
my favorite memories ever.

[gasps]

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.887 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I was surrounded
by such lively people

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:41.182 position:50% align:center
that I barely had any time
to think about it.

00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:44.811 position:50% align:center
So it's okay--I'm not lonely.

00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:48.440 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad. You should
nurture those friendships.

Hey, Siesta?

What?

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:56.489 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Well, about our
conversation from earlier.

00:10:56.573 --> 00:11:00.493 position:50% align:center
You know, about that time
when we got into bed together.

00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:02.829 position:50% align:center
I want you to know nothing
happened that night,

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:04.831 position:50% align:center
and I really regret that.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.292 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see.

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:08.668 position:50% align:center
To tell the truth...

00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:09.961 position:50% align:center
Ah?

00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:11.504 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Hmm.

00:11:11.588 --> 00:11:14.507 position:50% align:center
If it was you, I wouldn't have
minded if we did something,

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:16.509 position:50% align:center
even if just one time.

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:21.097 position:50% align:center
See, that would have
been good to know.

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:24.351 position:50% align:center
We can't go back,

What?! You mean you
met up with Mom?!

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:49.250 position:50% align:center
I did. If she hadn't shown up
exactly when she did,

[KIMIZUKA sighs]

00:11:59.469 --> 00:12:01.680 position:50% align:center
In hindsight, I think she knew.

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:04.391 position:50% align:center
That day, I feel like she had
a premonition that

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:06.685 position:50% align:center
she was going to die, you know?

00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:08.978 position:50% align:center
Agreed. Seems likely.

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:13.942 position:50% align:center

hypothetically, she had known...

[SAIKAWA ] Are you sure
that's what you want?

00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:51.688 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Yeah, it'll do.

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:53.982 position:50% align:center
But it just looks so
plain and ordinary.

00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:57.694 position:50% align:center
We both know you're already the
"boy next door" type as it is,

00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:00.196 position:50% align:center
so if you go wearing ordinary
clothing on top of that,

you'll vanish right
into the scenery.

Not very likely.

was common sense.

is it okay that
you're here with me?

There's a party, right?
To show appreciation for you?

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:43.823 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA ] Yeah, although I told
them that they didn't have

00:13:43.907 --> 00:13:45.950 position:50% align:center
to go to such lengths.

00:13:46.034 --> 00:13:48.244 position:50% align:center
Well, I mean, they do
owe you their lives.

headed home, safe and sound.

it would be nice to leave people

with a fun memory, instead of
a scary one, you know?

Also, when I sense people
are feeling down,

make them smile again!

I don't think I can talk to

00:14:48.972 --> 00:14:51.558 position:50% align:center

really bruised my confidence.

to play an active role

in solving it. I became
a victim, and that feels bad.

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:11.596 position:50% align:center

step in and save me.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.351 position:50% align:center
And, to make matters even worse,
I had to rely on her help.

herself, you know.

[NATSUNAGI]
Hmm?

00:16:22.816 --> 00:16:25.235 position:50% align:center
That you lent her your body
of your own volition

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:27.612 position:50% align:center
so we would succeed.

00:16:27.696 --> 00:16:29.197 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Huh?

00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:35.787 position:50% align:center
Are you actually asking me
to inhabit your body?

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.372 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:41.042 position:50% align:center
That's my condition in exchange
for hearing your last wishes.

Wow.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.088 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you're going
to be okay with that?

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:49.592 position:50% align:center
Your body belongs to you.
Even though you have my heart.

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:51.302 position:50% align:center
I know you're right.

00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:54.681 position:50% align:center
My hands... my legs...

00:16:54.764 --> 00:16:57.475 position:50% align:center
Everything, from the ends
of my hair down to my toes,

00:16:57.559 --> 00:17:00.395 position:50% align:center
it all belongs to me.

00:17:00.478 --> 00:17:04.315 position:50% align:center
And yet, my heart's
not just mine.

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:09.487 position:50% align:center
Which is why... I want you
to override my consciousness

00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:13.992 position:50% align:center
and save Kimizuka from the enemy
he's fighting as we speak.

00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:16.369 position:50% align:center
I am already dead, you know.

00:17:16.453 --> 00:17:19.706 position:50% align:center
It's not my place to get
involved with him anymore.

00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:21.082 position:50% align:center
Anyway...

00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:25.503 position:50% align:center
...it might be upsetting
for Sidekick...

00:17:25.587 --> 00:17:28.423 position:50% align:center
...if I were to show up again,
after all this time.

00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:31.217 position:50% align:center
Could be, but I guess that's
the risk you'd have to take

00:17:31.301 --> 00:17:33.261 position:50% align:center
if you want to save him.

00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:34.679 position:50% align:center
That's reckless.

00:17:34.763 --> 00:17:36.890 position:50% align:center
With stakes this high,
fretting about people's feelings

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:39.434 position:50% align:center
seems reckless to me.

00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:41.478 position:50% align:center
You and I are so different.

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:44.356 position:50% align:center
We don't see eye-to-eye
at all, do we?

00:17:44.439 --> 00:17:45.690 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Mm.

00:17:47.901 --> 00:17:50.445 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Oh, why not?

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:51.988 position:50% align:center
I just have to go to him?

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:53.448 position:50% align:center
Can do.

00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:56.159 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Hey.

00:17:58.161 --> 00:18:01.206 position:50% align:center
You gave me a real,
legendary detective.

00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:03.958 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much for that.

00:18:04.042 --> 00:18:08.088 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] And you've allowed me
to live on, even in death.

00:18:08.171 --> 00:18:09.756 position:50% align:center
You're wrong, though.

00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:13.259 position:50% align:center
You're the legendary detective
now, and you have my blessing.

00:18:13.343 --> 00:18:15.387 position:50% align:center
So make me proud.

00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:27.941 position:50% align:center
That conversation set the whole
plan into motion and it worked.

00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:30.276 position:50% align:center
You two saved my life.

00:18:32.153 --> 00:18:34.447 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Natsunagi has gifts,
ones that she herself

00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:36.032 position:50% align:center
isn't even aware of.

00:18:36.116 --> 00:18:38.952 position:50% align:center
 And in the days after we first
met, she brought back emotions

00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:41.621 position:50% align:center
I wasn't even aware
I had locked away.

00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:44.582 position:50% align:center
And, more importantly,
she made me remember the mission

00:18:44.666 --> 00:18:46.710 position:50% align:center
I was destined to fulfill.

00:18:46.793 --> 00:18:49.421 position:50% align:center
During the sapphire case,
Natsunagi was able to see

00:18:49.504 --> 00:18:54.175 position:50% align:center
what Saikawa truly desired,
much more quickly than I did.

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:57.887 position:50% align:center
She saved this case, too.
With her powers of persuasion,

00:18:57.971 --> 00:19:00.849 position:50% align:center
she was able to move Siesta
in a way I never could.

00:19:00.932 --> 00:19:04.394 position:50% align:center
Natsunagi has an intuitive gift:
in any given moment,

00:19:04.477 --> 00:19:06.896 position:50% align:center
she knows just the words
a person wants to hear,

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.648 position:50% align:center
or what needs to be done.

00:19:08.732 --> 00:19:11.860 position:50% align:center
It's a remarkable power,
which is why...

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:16.364 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] You're the ideal
legendary detective.

00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:21.327 position:50% align:center
I mean think about it. A real
detective solves problems

00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:24.330 position:50% align:center
their clients might
not even know they have.

00:19:24.414 --> 00:19:26.916 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
So manipulative!

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.088 position:50% align:center
All right, fine. I'll do it.

00:19:32.172 --> 00:19:34.382 position:50% align:center
But only 'cause someone
else asked me, too.

00:19:34.466 --> 00:19:37.635 position:50% align:center
Someone else?
Do you mean Siesta?

00:19:37.719 --> 00:19:40.555 position:50% align:center
Yep. That was the condition
for her to step in

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:43.058 position:50% align:center
and help me out,
just the one time.

00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:49.564 position:50% align:center
Nagisa Natsunagi, Yui Saikawa,
Charlotte Arisaka Anderson,

00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:52.984 position:50% align:center
and Kimihiko Kimizuka.

00:19:53.068 --> 00:19:54.152 position:50% align:center
I want the four of you...

00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:56.154 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] ...to bring
down SPES together.

00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:57.655 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA gasps]

00:19:57.739 --> 00:20:01.409 position:50% align:center
You four carry my bequest.
In death, I give you this task.

00:20:01.493 --> 00:20:03.661 position:50% align:center
That's my dying wish.

00:20:06.373 --> 00:20:07.999 position:50% align:center
Now I see.

00:20:10.085 --> 00:20:12.295 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA ] In that moment,
I knew I'd already signed up

00:20:12.379 --> 00:20:16.091 position:50% align:center
for the job, but hearing
that made it official.

00:20:16.174 --> 00:20:19.594 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI] Still... my lack
of confidence is a problem,

00:20:19.678 --> 00:20:21.888 position:50% align:center
and none of this
changes that fact.

00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:24.599 position:50% align:center
Oh, relax, when it comes
to lacking confidence,

00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:26.768 position:50% align:center
nobody has got
the upper hand on me.

00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:30.271 position:50% align:center
That is the most pathetic
one-upmanship I have ever heard.

00:20:30.355 --> 00:20:32.982 position:50% align:center
Another thing--you may have
gotten it into your head that,

00:20:33.066 --> 00:20:36.194 position:50% align:center
compared to you, Siesta
was perfect and superhuman,

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:37.612 position:50% align:center
but she had her flaws, too.

00:20:37.696 --> 00:20:38.988 position:50% align:center
Oh, did she really?

00:20:39.072 --> 00:20:40.740 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course she did.

00:20:40.824 --> 00:20:43.284 position:50% align:center
She'd get carried away
by the moment easily.

00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:47.205 position:50% align:center
At one point, for some reason,
we wound up in bed together--

00:20:47.288 --> 00:20:49.541 position:50% align:center
Oh. Uh, Natsunagi?

00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:51.793 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI sighs]

00:20:56.339 --> 00:20:57.716 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Hey.

00:20:57.799 --> 00:21:02.971 position:50% align:center
Tonight, when we're all done
here, come up to my room.

00:21:03.054 --> 00:21:06.016 position:50% align:center
Uh, what? You saying
what I think you are?

00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:11.730 position:50% align:center
Your eye... Are you...?

00:21:11.813 --> 00:21:14.107 position:50% align:center
You can't be...

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:16.901 position:50% align:center
I dunno what do you think?

00:21:16.985 --> 00:21:18.570 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Ah...

00:21:18.653 --> 00:21:21.281 position:50% align:center
[PA chime rings]

00:21:21.364 --> 00:21:22.574 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 12A]
Attention, passengers,

00:21:22.657 --> 00:21:25.827 position:50% align:center
this is an urgent request.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:28.121 position:50% align:center
We cannot provide
details at this time.

00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:29.372 position:50% align:center
However...

00:21:30.957 --> 00:21:32.876 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 12A] ...if there's
a detective onboard,

00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:35.920 position:50% align:center
please report to
the help desk at once.

00:21:36.004 --> 00:21:37.255 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Mm.

00:21:38.256 --> 00:21:39.632 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Hmm.

00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:42.844 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:21:44.429 --> 00:21:48.266 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
The detective is already dead.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:49.726 position:50% align:center
And yet...

00:21:52.395 --> 00:21:56.566 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] ...her dying wish
will live on without her.

00:22:00.487 --> 00:22:03.907 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] And that means...
it's still too soon

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.992 position:50% align:center
to call this an epilogue.

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.536 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
So, Sidekick...

00:23:31.619 --> 00:23:33.371 position:50% align:center
Please remember this.

00:23:34.998 --> 00:23:37.667 position:50% align:center
The name of the person who
will someday awaken you

00:23:37.751 --> 00:23:39.794 position:50% align:center
from your slumber is...

00:23:40.545 --> 00:23:42.005 position:50% align:center
...Nagisa.

00:23:43.882 --> 00:23:45.967 position:50% align:center
Nagisa Natsunagi.
