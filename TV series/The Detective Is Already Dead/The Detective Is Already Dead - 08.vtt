You can stop hiding now, Alicia.
Come on out.

[ALICIA]
Oops, busted.

00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:31.868 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Uh, you know, this
kind of thing tends to happen

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:33.661 position:50% align:center
from time to time.

00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:36.039 position:50% align:center
We've been traveling together
for three whole years--

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:38.083 position:50% align:center
having a fight or
two is only natural.

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:41.336 position:50% align:center
People get into spats.
It... happens.

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:43.755 position:50% align:center
I think it'd be weird
if we didn't fight.

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:45.882 position:50% align:center
To be fair, this may be
the first time we've had

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:48.009 position:50% align:center
a serious confrontation,
but what of it?

00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:49.386 position:50% align:center
You know what I mean?

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:53.473 position:50% align:center
The thing is, Siesta and me,
we're fine!

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:55.850 position:50% align:center
Are you? 'Cause you
seem real worried.

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:59.688 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Uh... Maybe we
should change the subject.

00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:01.564 position:50% align:center
So, on another note...

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:05.151 position:50% align:center
--[gasps]
--[KIMIZUKA] Mm.

00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:11.324 position:50% align:center
Ah! Is this...

00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:13.118 position:50% align:center
...from that one time?

00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:17.872 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It's not actually
a thank-you gift, though.

00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:19.541 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:21.960 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much...

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:25.005 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
This is the first time...

00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:27.674 position:50% align:center
...I've ever gotten
a present from anyone!

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:31.052 position:50% align:center
It's your first... present?

00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:35.223 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Mm! I can't prove it, but...

00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:38.435 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA] I think... that
before I lost my memory...

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:40.562 position:50% align:center
...I was a bad kid.

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:50.030 position:50% align:center
You say that like you're
not a bad kid now,

00:08:50.113 --> 00:08:51.740 position:50% align:center
and we both know you are.

00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:53.992 position:50% align:center
Oh, shut up!
I'm a super good kid!

00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:57.579 position:50% align:center
I'm lively, adorable, and
outspoken and everyone loves me!

00:08:57.662 --> 00:08:59.789 position:50% align:center
--Good one.
--It's not a joke!

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:02.292 position:50% align:center
You meanie! Waugh!

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:05.295 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Hey.

00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:09.758 position:50% align:center
Put this... ring on me...

00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:11.092 position:50% align:center
This guy?

00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:12.969 position:50% align:center
You, Kimizuka.

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:14.471 position:50% align:center
On this girl?

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:16.056 position:50% align:center
On me.

On the right finger,
or I'll be mad.

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:32.280 position:50% align:center
Does it have to go on that hand?

00:09:32.364 --> 00:09:35.367 position:50% align:center
Well, since it's
just pretend, okay.

00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:39.746 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA grunts]

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:46.753 position:50% align:center
Now you say your vows.

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:49.339 position:50% align:center
Wait, I thought this was
just the proposal?

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:50.757 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.926 position:50% align:center
You're something else.

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:56.179 position:50% align:center
Vows, okay.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:59.182 position:50% align:center
From this day on, for a
reasonable length of time,

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:00.809 position:50% align:center
we'll work together.

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:02.811 position:50% align:center
I swear it on this ring.

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:06.648 position:50% align:center
That sounded like
a business contract.

00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:09.234 position:50% align:center
I know, 'cause
that's what it is.

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:14.531 position:50% align:center

00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:21.204 position:50% align:center

I was too hard on you earlier.

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:23.873 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Siesta...

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:25.834 position:50% align:center
That said, I'm right,
and I know I'm right,

00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:27.961 position:50% align:center
so I don't yield that point,
but at the same time,

00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:29.379 position:50% align:center
I can acknowledge that
I shouldn't have been

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:30.922 position:50% align:center
so rude about it.

00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:33.133 position:50% align:center
I was wrong to try and bully
you into seeing things the way

00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:36.219 position:50% align:center
I do, even though
my way is far superior.

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:39.431 position:50% align:center
Because, there are some aspects
of this case you should rethink.

00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:41.975 position:50% align:center
Wait, no, I didn't wanna
rehash the argument.

00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:43.685 position:50% align:center
Suffice it to say
that I'm sorry,

00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:46.855 position:50% align:center
and I'd like a... clean slate...

00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:56.781 position:50% align:center

Did you say I'm obviously cute?

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.106 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Okay, I'll have
someone clean out your ears.

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:55.525 position:50% align:center
You're not supposed to
be mean to the injured.

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:59.154 position:50% align:center
If you can toss around
banter like this, you're fine.

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:01.531 position:50% align:center
That aside, Kimizuka,
how were you able to get to

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:03.199 position:50% align:center
that place so quickly?

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:06.453 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Oh. 'Cause I'd
put a tracking device on you.

00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:08.997 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, that does
make some sense.

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:14.169 position:50% align:center
You just casually said something
awful again, didn't you?!

Thanks, I thought
my face felt too clean.

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:19.341 position:50% align:center

[KIMIZUKA]
No, you've got it all wrong.

00:13:21.092 --> 00:13:22.886 position:50% align:center
Look, you take off at
the drop of a hat,

00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:25.055 position:50% align:center
this was a
precautionary measure.

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:27.640 position:50% align:center
When and where
did you attach it?!

00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:29.601 position:50% align:center
I'll give ya one guess, but you
should probably get more

00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:31.061 position:50% align:center
kid-appropriate undies.

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:33.063 position:50% align:center

You are the worst!

That is the most horrifying
place imaginable!

00:13:37.067 --> 00:13:40.320 position:50% align:center
But without that device, you
wouldn't have been rescued, so.

00:13:40.403 --> 00:13:42.864 position:50% align:center
You see? I can constantly
monitor your vital signs,

00:13:42.947 --> 00:13:43.990 position:50% align:center
isn't that cool?

[ALICIA whimpering]

00:13:46.034 --> 00:13:48.953 position:50% align:center
So, then... Why were you there?

00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:53.291 position:50% align:center
'Cause... I don't want anyone
else to experience it--

00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:55.460 position:50% align:center
the sadness that I felt.

00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:59.130 position:50% align:center
And... on top of that,
it's my job.

00:13:59.214 --> 00:14:00.590 position:50% align:center
I don't understand.

00:14:00.674 --> 00:14:02.342 position:50% align:center
Why're you
so obsessed with this?

[ALICIA sighs]

00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:07.097 position:50% align:center
I remember being
in a room with no light

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.890 position:50% align:center
or even any sound.

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:14.229 position:50% align:center
A dark, dark, boring world,
full of nothing but suffering.

00:14:14.312 --> 00:14:16.064 position:50% align:center
But, then...

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:19.651 position:50% align:center
Not too long ago,
the world got bigger.

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:21.319 position:50% align:center
Light came in.

00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:25.073 position:50% align:center
I could hear sounds, and I...

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:28.618 position:50% align:center
I learned how sweet apples were.

00:14:28.702 --> 00:14:31.579 position:50% align:center
I wanted to try
a different way of living.

00:14:31.663 --> 00:14:34.374 position:50% align:center
If I could be reborn as
a whole new person,

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:36.751 position:50% align:center
and I could work as a detective,

00:14:36.835 --> 00:14:40.130 position:50% align:center
then I wanted to
live for that alone.

00:14:40.213 --> 00:14:42.132 position:50% align:center
Oh, Alicia...

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:46.511 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. I've been
talking way too much.

00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:49.180 position:50% align:center
I'm feeling sleepy now.

00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:50.932 position:50% align:center
I'll stay with you
until morning.

00:14:51.016 --> 00:14:53.435 position:50% align:center
You can rest easy.

00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:54.978 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:00.442 position:50% align:center
Will you... hold my hand, then?

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:02.485 position:50% align:center
People might call you
a baby, though.

00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:03.820 position:50% align:center
Baby.

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:07.574 position:50% align:center
As long as you're holding
my hand, I don't care.

00:15:07.657 --> 00:15:11.036 position:50% align:center
If that's what you want...

00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:13.246 position:50% align:center

00:15:27.385 --> 00:15:33.183 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA panting]

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.534 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] What in the world
are you doing here?

00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:56.289 position:50% align:center
I could ask the same of you.

00:15:56.373 --> 00:15:59.542 position:50% align:center
I only came to this place
in pursuit of Hel.

00:15:59.626 --> 00:16:02.754 position:50% align:center
Why'd you think
Hel would come here?

00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:06.174 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] You've realized it
too by now, haven't you?

00:16:06.257 --> 00:16:08.301 position:50% align:center
Realized what?

00:16:08.385 --> 00:16:09.969 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] That if there was
some other way for the culprit

00:16:10.053 --> 00:16:12.055 position:50% align:center
to get the hearts,
then there wouldn't have been

00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:14.474 position:50% align:center
a single murder.

00:16:14.557 --> 00:16:16.851 position:50% align:center
I have and today,
that police officer

00:16:16.935 --> 00:16:19.270 position:50% align:center
was almost the next victim.

00:16:19.354 --> 00:16:22.148 position:50% align:center
That's right. The officer
was injured on the left side

00:16:22.232 --> 00:16:23.274 position:50% align:center
of his chest.

00:16:23.358 --> 00:16:25.694 position:50% align:center
Without question,
Hel attacked him.

00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:28.863 position:50% align:center
So, then...
why was she--Alicia--

00:16:28.947 --> 00:16:31.533 position:50% align:center
wounded on her right shoulder?

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:34.744 position:50% align:center
Is it possible the cop shot her?

00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:38.832 position:50% align:center
And if that is the case, did he
shoot her in self-defense?

00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:42.585 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Get out of my way, Siesta.

00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:43.878 position:50% align:center
I have to--

00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:50.176 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA grunts]
Didn't you recognize the knife?

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.679 position:50% align:center
The one at the scene.

00:16:52.762 --> 00:16:54.264 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:55.932 position:50% align:center
I had to get Alicia to safety--

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:57.809 position:50% align:center
I couldn't check
every little thing.

00:16:57.892 --> 00:16:59.477 position:50% align:center
It came from our place.

00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:02.355 position:50% align:center
That knife went missing
from our kitchen.

00:17:02.439 --> 00:17:04.024 position:50% align:center
[growls]
What really matters now is that

00:17:04.107 --> 00:17:06.276 position:50% align:center
we find Alicia right away!

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:10.238 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] Come on. You had
to have known, too.

00:17:10.321 --> 00:17:13.074 position:50% align:center
Admit it, Kimi. That's the real
reason you put a tracking device

00:17:13.158 --> 00:17:14.451 position:50% align:center
in that ring you gave her.

00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:15.994 position:50% align:center
That's enough!

00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:19.164 position:50% align:center
Alicia's not Hel.

00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:20.707 position:50% align:center
She can't be!

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:25.378 position:50% align:center
And what about
the Fuubi impostor?

00:17:25.462 --> 00:17:27.839 position:50% align:center
You immediately assumed
she was Hel, too, right?

00:17:27.922 --> 00:17:30.425 position:50% align:center
And yet Alicia
was there with us.

00:17:30.508 --> 00:17:33.845 position:50% align:center
Alicia is Hel.
She is Hel, transformed.

00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:36.431 position:50% align:center
And so, we have to assume
that impostor was

00:17:36.514 --> 00:17:38.099 position:50% align:center
some other adversary.

00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:40.310 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Are you telling me
there's another android

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:42.103 position:50% align:center
like Hel out there?

00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:45.231 position:50% align:center
Yes, it seems reasonable
to assume as much.

00:17:45.315 --> 00:17:46.316 position:50% align:center
Some sort of ringleader

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:47.901 position:50% align:center
presiding over
them all, perhaps.

00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:50.236 position:50% align:center
What? That's just ridiculous.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center
Hel is our priority, though.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.490 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:54.866 --> 00:17:57.619 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] We have to
find her, and quickly.

00:17:57.702 --> 00:17:59.245 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
You mean Alicia!

00:17:59.329 --> 00:18:02.499 position:50% align:center
She's not Hel, she's not!
She's just Alicia.

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:04.626 position:50% align:center
I'm... sure of it...

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:07.671 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] Immediately after Hel
stabbbed herself in the heart,

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:10.548 position:50% align:center
the opportunist killer
harvesting hearts showed up.

00:18:10.632 --> 00:18:14.219 position:50% align:center
Then, at that very time, an
unidentified girl with amnesia

00:18:14.302 --> 00:18:16.763 position:50% align:center
suddenly appeared
in front of us.

00:18:16.846 --> 00:18:19.099 position:50% align:center
So, Sidekick, are you gonna
lie to yourself and insist

00:18:19.182 --> 00:18:20.934 position:50% align:center
it's just a coincidence?

00:18:22.686 --> 00:18:25.480 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Did... you know
from the beginning?

00:18:25.563 --> 00:18:29.234 position:50% align:center
'Course not. If it had dawned
on me as soon as we met her,

00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:31.945 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't have
let so many people die.

00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:36.616 position:50% align:center
But... I still... could never
bring myself to distrust her.

00:18:37.701 --> 00:18:39.869 position:50% align:center
This is completely absurd.

00:18:39.953 --> 00:18:43.039 position:50% align:center
Are you saying that everything
we knew about Alicia was a lie?

00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:45.291 position:50% align:center
All the crying, the
beautiful words she said

00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:46.751 position:50% align:center
to that victim's mother?

00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:49.004 position:50% align:center
Are you telling me
she faked all of it?!

00:18:49.087 --> 00:18:51.089 position:50% align:center
I think that part was real.

00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:53.591 position:50% align:center
There's no doubt in my mind
Alicia's words really did

00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:55.218 position:50% align:center
help that woman.

00:18:56.386 --> 00:18:58.471 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:58.555 --> 00:19:01.975 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Then... in the
lefthand side of Alicia's chest,

00:19:02.058 --> 00:19:03.893 position:50% align:center
that woman's daughter's heart...

00:19:03.977 --> 00:19:07.313 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA] Sorry. Guess I'll
never be a legendary detective.

00:19:07.397 --> 00:19:08.773 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:19:11.443 --> 00:19:13.653 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Alicia...

00:19:13.737 --> 00:19:18.366 position:50% align:center
Inside of this body, I carry a
whole other version of myself.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.869 position:50% align:center
It's like I live in the
background, so I don't have

00:19:20.952 --> 00:19:25.123 position:50% align:center
that many memories, and I have
no idea who I really am.

00:19:25.206 --> 00:19:27.542 position:50% align:center
That's why I kept
saying strange things.

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:30.920 position:50% align:center
Like when I told you
the real me was 17.

00:19:31.004 --> 00:19:34.299 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I knew it
all along on some level.

00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:37.886 position:50% align:center
But I pretended not to know...
that the other me was committing

00:19:37.969 --> 00:19:40.347 position:50% align:center
those terrible crimes.

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:44.017 position:50% align:center
But, for some reason,
as Kimizuka and I

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.353 position:50% align:center
were investigating,
I prayed someone else

00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:48.146 position:50% align:center
was the real culprit.

00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:51.858 position:50% align:center
I had to believe the lie
that I wasn't guilty.

00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:53.151 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Alicia!

00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:54.694 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:57.113 position:50% align:center
You are not a bad kid.

00:19:57.197 --> 00:19:59.074 position:50% align:center
You may be a little
self-centered, and you have

00:19:59.157 --> 00:20:02.327 position:50% align:center
caused a lot of people undue
suffering, but at your core,

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.329 position:50% align:center
you're a kind person!

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:07.207 position:50% align:center
I've seen you share in
people's joy and heartbreak.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:08.917 position:50% align:center
You can even get angry
and feel sadness

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.336 position:50% align:center
on other people's behalf.

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:13.213 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Alicia, you're not--

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.591 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] I knew it was
an impossible hope.

00:20:16.675 --> 00:20:18.843 position:50% align:center
And yet... I still...

00:20:18.927 --> 00:20:21.346 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Kimizuka?

00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:22.722 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful.

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:26.726 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA] It was short,
but it was fun while it lasted.

00:20:28.353 --> 00:20:31.231 position:50% align:center
Please believe me when I say
that I wanted to keep doing

00:20:31.314 --> 00:20:33.149 position:50% align:center
detective work with you.

00:20:35.318 --> 00:20:38.780 position:50% align:center
But I... I can't stay
with you anymore.

00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:43.034 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] All I wanted was for
Alicia to stay just like this.

00:20:43.118 --> 00:20:44.703 position:50% align:center
The truth is...

00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:49.457 position:50% align:center
...I was never anything but bad.

00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:53.878 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] But what I wanted
would have taken a miracle!

00:21:02.512 --> 00:21:03.805 position:50% align:center
Alicia, no!

00:21:03.888 --> 00:21:05.348 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Sidekick!

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:11.813 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA gasps]

00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:12.856 position:50% align:center

[SIESTA grunts]

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.735 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Alicia.

00:21:16.818 --> 00:21:18.528 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Don't do it, Siesta!

00:21:20.071 --> 00:21:21.781 position:50% align:center
What is wrong with you?!

00:21:21.865 --> 00:21:24.576 position:50% align:center
We have to--
we can't just let her go.

00:21:24.659 --> 00:21:25.869 position:50% align:center
Don't you understand?

00:21:25.952 --> 00:21:27.829 position:50% align:center
If you don't get a handle
on your emotions,

00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:30.582 position:50% align:center
they'll warp every
decision that you make!

00:21:30.665 --> 00:21:33.668 position:50% align:center
It's you who doesn't understand!
Emotions are what make us human!

00:21:33.752 --> 00:21:36.004 position:50% align:center
Siesta, haven't you
learned anything?!

00:21:42.427 --> 00:21:44.804 position:50% align:center
My, my, did I interrupt a spat?

00:21:44.888 --> 00:21:46.264 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:21:48.767 --> 00:21:49.976 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:53.897 --> 00:21:58.109 position:50% align:center
[CHAMELEON] I've found her
at last. So troublesome.

00:21:58.193 --> 00:22:00.820 position:50% align:center
Here I believed she'd just
strayed when I let my attention

00:22:00.904 --> 00:22:04.282 position:50% align:center
wander elsewhere. To think that
she'd not only changed form,

00:22:04.366 --> 00:22:06.659 position:50% align:center
but also lost her memory.

00:22:06.743 --> 00:22:08.495 position:50% align:center
Chameleon!

00:22:08.578 --> 00:22:11.122 position:50% align:center
Where do you intend
to take Alicia?

00:22:11.206 --> 00:22:14.334 position:50% align:center
[CHAMELEON] Approximately 700
nautical miles northwest of here

00:22:14.417 --> 00:22:17.045 position:50% align:center
is our isolated island base.

00:22:18.088 --> 00:22:21.257 position:50% align:center
[CHAMELEON] If you're implying
that you mean to come for her,

00:22:21.341 --> 00:22:24.719 position:50% align:center
we'll be eagerly
awaiting your arrival.

00:22:24.803 --> 00:22:26.262 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
No, wait!

00:22:31.976 --> 00:22:33.186 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA grunts]

00:22:37.565 --> 00:22:38.983 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:40.443 --> 00:22:42.862 position:50% align:center
For a second,
I thought I'd been shot.

00:22:46.282 --> 00:22:47.992 position:50% align:center
Are you dumb, Kimi?

00:22:50.286 --> 00:22:52.455 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
I won't be apologizing.

00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:56.543 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Fine, don't, I get it.

00:22:56.626 --> 00:22:59.462 position:50% align:center
I know you were just doing
what you felt was right,

00:22:59.546 --> 00:23:02.924 position:50% align:center
and I was doing what
I thought was right.

00:23:03.008 --> 00:23:06.678 position:50% align:center
So, I can see why
you wouldn't apologize.

00:23:06.761 --> 00:23:10.390 position:50% align:center
I have no reason to, either,
and I'm fine with that.

00:23:12.475 --> 00:23:14.936 position:50% align:center
What do we... do now?

00:23:17.856 --> 00:23:20.900 position:50% align:center
Let's go to
the grocery store first.

00:23:20.984 --> 00:23:24.487 position:50% align:center
And when we get there,
we'll buy the biggest, reddest,

00:23:24.571 --> 00:23:27.198 position:50% align:center
roundest, apples we can find.

00:23:27.282 --> 00:23:30.160 position:50% align:center
And then let's make the biggest,
most delicious apple pie

00:23:30.243 --> 00:23:35.040 position:50% align:center
ever baked, and brew the best
pot of tea ever brewed.

00:23:35.123 --> 00:23:36.624 position:50% align:center
And then...

00:23:36.708 --> 00:23:38.960 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:23:39.044 --> 00:23:41.546 position:50% align:center
...we'll begin our journey...

00:23:41.629 --> 00:23:43.548 position:50% align:center
...to save our friend.
