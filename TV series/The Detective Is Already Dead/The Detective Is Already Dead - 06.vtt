[SIESTA chuckles]

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:11.359 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Yikes, I'm sorry!

00:19:11.443 --> 00:19:13.737 position:50% align:center
Forget what I said--
I swear I'll make it up to you!

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:17.115 position:50% align:center
This apple-free apple pie
is really tasty.

00:19:17.198 --> 00:19:18.908 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Really?!

00:19:18.992 --> 00:19:21.077 position:50% align:center
The most important lesson
today is that you should've

00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:23.413 position:50% align:center
brought her to me from
the very beginning.

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:25.206 position:50% align:center
A missing girl who's
suffering from amnesia is

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.960 position:50% align:center
a classic situation for
a detective to handle.

00:19:29.044 --> 00:19:30.879 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.

00:19:30.962 --> 00:19:32.839 position:50% align:center
You said your
name's Alicia, right?

00:19:32.922 --> 00:19:34.299 position:50% align:center
And you don't remember
your full name

00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:36.217 position:50% align:center
or any other details like that?

00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:40.138 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA] Mm. No, all I know for
sure is that I'm 17 years old.

00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:42.349 position:50% align:center
You must mean you're seven.

00:19:42.432 --> 00:19:43.600 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Seventeen!

00:19:43.683 --> 00:19:47.354 position:50% align:center
If I were a betting man,
she's about 12 or 13.

00:19:47.437 --> 00:19:50.231 position:50% align:center
At least that's the idea I got
from looking at her calves.

00:19:50.315 --> 00:19:53.526 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] This is not the time to
disclose your peculiar fetishes.

00:19:54.652 --> 00:19:57.530 position:50% align:center
Alicia. We can help you and
take on the responsibility

00:19:57.614 --> 00:19:59.824 position:50% align:center
of figuring out who you are,

00:19:59.908 --> 00:20:02.243 position:50% align:center
but there's no way
we can do it for free.

00:20:02.327 --> 00:20:05.663 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you serious?
You're gonna make a kid pay?

00:20:05.747 --> 00:20:08.124 position:50% align:center
Her age means nothing--
she will still require a lot of

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:11.044 position:50% align:center
our time and attention, and
it's important for her to learn

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:14.297 position:50% align:center
that no one ever gets anything
for free in this cruel world.

00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:16.424 position:50% align:center
That's definitely true.

00:20:16.508 --> 00:20:18.551 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed
to pay you, then?

00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:21.388 position:50% align:center
How 'bout this: do the work
of a legendary detective

00:20:21.471 --> 00:20:23.348 position:50% align:center
instead of me.

00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:26.351 position:50% align:center
You want me to be...
a detective?

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:28.603 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec, don't you
think that's a bit much

00:20:28.687 --> 00:20:30.605 position:50% align:center
to be asking of a child?

00:20:30.689 --> 00:20:33.274 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Maybe, but I have a feeling.

00:20:33.358 --> 00:20:35.485 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA sighs]
Okay, I get it.

00:20:35.568 --> 00:20:37.112 position:50% align:center
You're out of business
because of your injury,

00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:38.822 position:50% align:center
and you want me to
take on the detective role

00:20:38.905 --> 00:20:41.032 position:50% align:center
with Alicia working
as my sidekick.

00:20:41.116 --> 00:20:42.867 position:50% align:center
No, thank you.

00:20:42.951 --> 00:20:45.495 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] Wrong. There's
no other way to say this:

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:47.706 position:50% align:center
You just have
the face of a sidekick.

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:49.541 position:50% align:center
This is absurd.

00:20:49.624 --> 00:20:51.626 position:50% align:center
If you accept this offer,
then we'll commit to

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:54.254 position:50% align:center
taking care of you and
you can live with us.

00:20:54.337 --> 00:20:56.006 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA] Hey, wait,
I'm not sure if I'm cut out

00:20:56.089 --> 00:20:58.717 position:50% align:center
to suddenly work as a detective.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.135 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
If you do...

00:21:00.218 --> 00:21:02.429 position:50% align:center
...you can order your sidekick
around however you want.

00:21:02.512 --> 00:21:04.347 position:50% align:center
Oh, yay! I'll do it!

00:21:04.431 --> 00:21:06.474 position:50% align:center
I want to be
a legendary detective!

00:21:06.558 --> 00:21:08.893 position:50% align:center
That was an appalling
negotiation.

00:21:08.977 --> 00:21:11.187 position:50% align:center
So? Tell me all about
what it means to be

00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:13.815 position:50% align:center
a top secret sleuth--

00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:15.608 position:50% align:center
[FUUBI] Our Jack the Ripper
seems to have come back

00:21:15.692 --> 00:21:17.527 position:50% align:center
--to haunt us.
--[GROUP gasping]

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.070 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Whoa, Fuubi?

00:21:19.154 --> 00:21:22.365 position:50% align:center
Wha--? I thought
you went back to Japan.

00:21:22.449 --> 00:21:25.535 position:50% align:center
No, I stayed to
take care of a thing.

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:27.912 position:50% align:center
More importantly...

00:21:27.996 --> 00:21:30.123 position:50% align:center
...when did you
two pop out a kid?

00:21:30.206 --> 00:21:32.667 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA, SIESTA] You need
to get your eyes checked.

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:34.377 position:50% align:center
[FUUBI]
Hmm...

00:21:34.461 --> 00:21:35.879 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Can we, like, rewind?

00:21:35.962 --> 00:21:38.048 position:50% align:center
Did you say our
Jack the Ripper's back?

00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:39.507 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:42.385 position:50% align:center
We discovered another victim
missing a heart yesterday.

00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:44.471 position:50% align:center
M.O. resembles what
we've seen before.

00:21:44.554 --> 00:21:46.473 position:50% align:center
What the--
That doesn't make sense.

00:21:46.556 --> 00:21:48.433 position:50% align:center
Because Cerberus was--

00:21:51.561 --> 00:21:52.729 position:50% align:center
It's Hel.

00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:54.481 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:21:54.564 --> 00:21:57.108 position:50% align:center
The truth is, we have some
information that may prove to be

00:21:57.192 --> 00:21:59.652 position:50% align:center
quite useful in pursuing her.

00:21:59.736 --> 00:22:03.031 position:50% align:center
It's still just a rumor, but we
have intel about an object

00:22:03.114 --> 00:22:05.367 position:50% align:center
that could potentially
bring down SPES.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:07.077 position:50% align:center
It's right here in the city.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:11.206 position:50% align:center
And apparently,
said objectis being referred to

00:22:11.289 --> 00:22:13.208 position:50% align:center
as the "Eye of Sapphire."
