[KIMIZUKA] You say you're
not anything at all?

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:24.941 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Well, if you're
not anything at all,

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:28.528 position:50% align:center
you should be free to become
anything you want.

someone who does

how to live your life,

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:49.966 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Yeah, I made
my decision a long time ago.

'Cause we have an arrangement--

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:58.808 position:50% align:center

can't die before I do.

Right, Saikawa.

going easy on you.

Trust me when I say...
I shall give you the death

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.458 position:50% align:center
you so richly deserve!

[growls]

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:46.810 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] There was this
moment, I said to Siesta,

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:48.895 position:50% align:center
"You don't seem
like a detective.

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:52.399 position:50% align:center
If you ask me, you're more like
a secret agent or something."

00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:55.485 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] I see, well,
while you may not think

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:57.570 position:50% align:center
I seem like a detective.

00:03:57.654 --> 00:04:00.407 position:50% align:center
Perhaps our definitions
of the word just differ a bit.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.158 position:50% align:center
I believe a detective
is one who protects

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:04.911 position:50% align:center
their client's
interests at all times.

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:07.288 position:50% align:center
I take great pride in
doing this sort of work.

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:09.207 position:50% align:center
It's an honorable profession.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.625 position:50% align:center
That's why I've always done it,

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.628 position:50% align:center
and why I'll continue
to do so in the future.

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:16.631 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA chuckles]

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:18.550 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] In saying that,
Siesta stood firm

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:22.387 position:50% align:center
in her identity as a detective,
not a secret agent.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.306 position:50% align:center
And I think that what Siesta
meant by "client"

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.852 position:50% align:center
was actually every human
being other than herself.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:31.438 position:50% align:center
For that reason,
she referred to herself as

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:34.107 position:50% align:center
"a legendary
detective by nature."

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:37.861 position:50% align:center
--And then she laughed.
--[chuckles]

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:40.196 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Her smile was beyond radiant.

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:45.577 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] To be honest,
from here on out,

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.037 position:50% align:center
I'm just winging it.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.708 position:50% align:center
It was a close call, but we
managed to save Natsunagi.

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:54.753 position:50% align:center
The fact that Saikawa raced
over here when she did,

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:57.172 position:50% align:center
tells me that the evacuation
of all the other passengers

00:04:57.255 --> 00:04:59.758 position:50% align:center
should be complete by now.

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:02.218 position:50% align:center
If I'm the only one who
goes down with the ship,

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:04.220 position:50% align:center
then that's just fine by me.

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:07.390 position:50% align:center
Ooh, I like that resolute
look in your eye.

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.809 position:50% align:center
Planning to die alone
tonight, are we?

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:13.271 position:50% align:center
No, thanks. You'll be joining me
whether you like it or not.

00:05:13.355 --> 00:05:16.566 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but I don't intend to simply

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:19.110 position:50% align:center
hand my life over
to you this evening.

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:22.739 position:50% align:center
After I've killed you,
I'll kill those girls, as well.

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:25.825 position:50% align:center
Not just to spite you--
I do have a purpose in mind.

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:26.951 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:29.245 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you'll
be happy to hear.

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:31.623 position:50% align:center
I don't plan on
making it quick, either.

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:33.792 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Why don't you plan
on making it quick?

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:35.585 position:50% align:center
[CHAMELEON]
Well, you see...

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.506 position:50% align:center
...I know they possess the "Eye
of Sapphire," and that heart.

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.175 position:50% align:center
From the tips of their
toes to every single hair

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:45.261 position:50% align:center
on their heads, it's worth
examining them meticulously,

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:46.930 position:50% align:center
don't you think?

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:50.308 position:50% align:center
I'll relish tormenting them,
and by the time I am done,

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:53.561 position:50% align:center
they will both be begging me
to let them die!

00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:57.399 position:50% align:center
But only at the very, very end
will I grant them that mercy.

00:05:57.482 --> 00:05:59.317 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA grunts]

00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:02.570 position:50% align:center
Right, then, I think that's
enough talk for one evening.

00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:05.990 position:50% align:center
Have you made your reservations
for your impending trip to Hell?

00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:07.992 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.
Unfortunately for you,

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:11.287 position:50% align:center
that destination doesn't
appear on my itinerary.

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.206 position:50% align:center
There must be
some mistake, then.

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:14.499 position:50% align:center
Let's go anyway!

and I will kill those girls

you helped escape.

You, and all the humans you've
fought so hard to protect,

will perish.

I have to protect
the two of them.

That Char...

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:13.952 position:50% align:center
So she was planning to do this
right from the beginning.

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:16.538 position:50% align:center
From the first moment I boarded
this ship, I felt a presence

that was eerily familiar to me.

And Kimizuka...

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.820 position:50% align:center
For the record, I still
don't like you--I hate you!

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:54.075 position:50% align:center
And yet... you were the one
Mom chose as her sidekick.

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:57.912 position:50% align:center
She didn't pick me,
but you, and I hate you for it!

be gone, but...

Kimi...

00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:19.242 position:50% align:center
I promise that
I'll never forget you!

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:22.245 position:50% align:center
Even if my consciousness
is stripped away in the end,

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:24.622 position:50% align:center
your memory's the one thing
that will remain!

00:19:27.042 --> 00:19:32.380 position:50% align:center
It may take time. I can't say
exactly how, or when.

00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:35.300 position:50% align:center
Might be a week,
a month, or even a year!

00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:38.178 position:50% align:center
Who knows? It may take
even longer than that.

00:19:38.261 --> 00:19:43.016 position:50% align:center
Nevertheless, someday soon,
I will find my way to you,

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:44.851 position:50% align:center
for one last goodbye!

[KIMIZUKA sobs]

00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:48.563 position:50% align:center
Without fail.

00:19:51.066 --> 00:19:53.068 position:50% align:center
I promise!

[KIMIZUKA]
I remember.

00:20:07.457 --> 00:20:09.793 position:50% align:center
That's what Siesta wanted.

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:14.339 position:50% align:center
For Alicia and me to
take down SPES together.

00:20:14.422 --> 00:20:17.592 position:50% align:center
That was her final dying wish.

00:20:17.676 --> 00:20:19.219 position:50% align:center
And also...

[ALICIA]
A ribbon sounds nice...

00:20:25.308 --> 00:20:27.268 position:50% align:center
I sure would love
to wear one.

00:20:27.352 --> 00:20:30.855 position:50% align:center
And try to enroll
at a real school.

[KIMIZUKA] No matter
how cruel reality may be,

00:21:01.553 --> 00:21:04.180 position:50% align:center
I refuse to run from it anymore.

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:07.308 position:50% align:center
So until I have
fulfilled my promise to Siesta.

00:21:07.392 --> 00:21:08.852 position:50% align:center
I will fight!

Right, then, I think
that should do it.

00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:47.349 position:50% align:center
Now you will never be able
to attack me again.
