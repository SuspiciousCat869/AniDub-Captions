[ATTENDANT 1A]
Attention passengers.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:17.308 position:50% align:center
Is there a detective on board?

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:25.650 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
I must have heard that wrong.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:27.861 position:50% align:center
That's not the sort of thing
they ask for on a flight

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:30.822 position:50% align:center
at 35,000 feet in the air.

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:34.701 position:50% align:center
I must be mistaken.
At least, I hope.

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:37.912 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Although,
it wouldn't surprise me--

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:40.373 position:50% align:center
I've always stumbled
face-first into trouble.

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:43.501 position:50% align:center
It's like I'm a magnet
for inconvenience.

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:46.671 position:50% align:center
Getting caught up in a flash mob
just walking down the street.

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:48.590 position:50% align:center
Or witnessing a white
powder transaction

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:50.342 position:50% align:center
while testing a new shortcut.

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:52.844 position:50% align:center
The sheer number of murder
scenes I've happened upon

00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:56.014 position:50% align:center
has made me a regular "person
of interest" with the police.

00:00:56.097 --> 00:00:57.599 position:50% align:center
Or like today.

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:01.603 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] I'm being
forced to fly overseas,

00:01:01.686 --> 00:01:04.022 position:50% align:center
carrying an oversized
attaché case containing

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:06.149 position:50% align:center
I have no idea whatsoever.

00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:10.195 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
The question just seems odd.

00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:13.782 position:50% align:center
I can understand the flight
attendant asking for a doctor...

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:16.076 position:50% align:center
...or a nurse.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.495 position:50% align:center
But a detective?

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:20.163 position:50% align:center
[ATTENDANT 1A]
Your attention, please!

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:23.124 position:50% align:center
Is there a detective on board?

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:26.169 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Wow. So I
didn't hear her wrong.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:30.548 position:50% align:center
But it's not my problem,
because I'm not a detective.

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:33.301 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm a detective.

00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:34.678 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:44.104 position:50% align:center
Hey. Can you tell me your name?

00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:52.028 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh man, why'd
I just blurt that out?

00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:56.574 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Perfect.

00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:58.034 position:50% align:center
Hey, you.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.705 position:50% align:center
Be my sidekick
for this case, will you?

00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:05.792 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:10.547 position:50% align:center
Yes, as I said, I'm a detective.
This is my sidekick.

00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:13.633 position:50% align:center
Right this way.

00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:16.302 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Hang on, what is this about?

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.933 position:50% align:center
It's Siesta.

00:02:22.017 --> 00:02:23.768 position:50% align:center
Siesta?

00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:26.062 position:50% align:center
You asked me what my name was.

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:27.772 position:50% align:center
That's kind of an odd name.

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:29.190 position:50% align:center
It's a code name.

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:30.608 position:50% align:center
A code name?

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:32.068 position:50% align:center
Lots of people have them.

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:34.946 position:50% align:center
You're the first I've met.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.698 position:50% align:center
What's your name?

00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:38.742 position:50% align:center
Kimizuka Kimihiko.

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:41.619 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] I see.
Then I'll call you "Kimi."

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:45.623 position:50% align:center
Do you mean, like, a nickname?
Or like "you" in Japanese?

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:48.960 position:50% align:center
What do you think, Kimi?

00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:50.879 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA grunts]

00:02:50.962 --> 00:02:52.339 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:57.385 position:50% align:center
I've found one, and the
detective has a sidekick.

00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:01.765 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA gasps]

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:06.644 position:50% align:center
[BAT] Oh? So there actually
was a detective on board.

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:10.774 position:50% align:center
You're substantially younger
than I would have imagined.

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:13.068 position:50% align:center
Which one is the detective?

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:16.571 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA gulps] This is one of
the worst situations imaginable.

00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:20.241 position:50% align:center
First things first,
introduce yourself, please.

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:22.243 position:50% align:center
--[gasps]
--[BAT] Hmph.

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:25.872 position:50% align:center
It's "Bat." A code
name, of course.

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:27.874 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
See?

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:30.669 position:50% align:center
Lots of people have code names,
just as I told you.

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:32.045 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding me?!

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:33.880 position:50% align:center
I don't care about being
wrong about that kinda stuff

00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:35.715 position:50% align:center
at a time like this!

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.052 position:50% align:center
My name's Siesta.
This is my sidekick, Watson.

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:43.139 position:50% align:center
The two of us grew up
together on Baker Street.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:47.185 position:50% align:center
Tell me, Bat. What is it
you're trying to do?

00:03:47.268 --> 00:03:50.980 position:50% align:center
And why did you call for me,
a legendary detective?

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:54.401 position:50% align:center
Hah! This little lady's funny!

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:56.986 position:50% align:center
Right, then. Let's see if
you can deduce the reason why

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.197 position:50% align:center
I commandeered
this passenger jet.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.865 position:50% align:center
If you manage
to deduce correctly,

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.451 position:50% align:center
then I'll refrain from
snapping the pilot's neck.

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:04.619 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:06.454 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Hmm.

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:08.957 position:50% align:center
You didn't call us up here just
to have us guess the answer

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.667 position:50% align:center
to that question, did you?

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.712 position:50% align:center
On the nose, detective.
It's all just a game.

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:17.716 position:50% align:center
A deadly game where the lives
of 600 passengers are at stake.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.718 position:50% align:center
It's all so exciting!

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:22.012 position:50% align:center
If you're able to correctly
surmise my reasoning

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:26.641 position:50% align:center
for this attempted hijacking,
then you win, and that's that.

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:29.394 position:50% align:center
So if we succeed, we save
the lives of everyone onboard,

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:31.813 position:50% align:center
and if we fail, they die, right?

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:34.816 position:50% align:center
Sure! We'll keep it
nice and simple.

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:36.401 position:50% align:center
Fair enough.

00:04:36.484 --> 00:04:38.903 position:50% align:center
But you must be aware if we fail
at this little test of yours,

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:41.865 position:50% align:center
you'll crash and burn
with everyone else on board.

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:43.908 position:50% align:center
Do you not value your own life?

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:45.410 position:50% align:center
If I wasn't doing
something like this,

00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:49.581 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't feel truly alive.
You get me?

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:52.876 position:50% align:center
Wow, you have so much
time on your hands.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:54.252 position:50% align:center
You might have a point!

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:56.004 position:50% align:center
It's gotten so bad,
that I've gone and hijacked

00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:58.423 position:50% align:center
a plane now, haven't I?

00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:01.176 position:50% align:center
Right. You just
gave me the answer.

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:02.552 position:50% align:center
Ah?!

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:04.637 position:50% align:center
With all that time on your
hands, you got so bored,

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.140 position:50% align:center
you hijacked a plane for fun.

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:08.892 position:50% align:center
[BAT gasps]

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.144 position:50% align:center
That's my final answer.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:17.275 position:50% align:center
Wait, isn't that a bit hasty?
Are you really sure?

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:18.985 position:50% align:center
The lives of all of these
innocent passengers

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:21.154 position:50% align:center
depend on your answer!

00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:23.031 position:50% align:center
I mean...

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:24.949 position:50% align:center
He just told us
as much, didn't he?

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:27.285 position:50% align:center
He got bored,
had nothing else to do,

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:29.829 position:50% align:center
so he thought
"I'll hijack a plane!"

00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:31.706 position:50% align:center
Look, I heard
the same thing as you,

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.417 position:50% align:center
but what if he was saying
that as a distraction?

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:37.462 position:50% align:center
Ah, that. Are you
insinuating that this man

00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:38.546 position:50% align:center
could be lying?

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:39.798 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:41.841 position:50% align:center
Face to face with
an Ace Detective,

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:44.594 position:50% align:center
he's intimidated into claiming
that the answer he let slip

00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:47.222 position:50% align:center
was actually a red herring,
and so he's planning to bring

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:50.392 position:50% align:center
the entire game to an end
by insisting that I lost?

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:51.851 position:50% align:center
In other words...

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:53.561 position:50% align:center
...you're saying he's scared?

00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:55.438 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA gasps]

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:57.315 position:50% align:center
Well, am I right?

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:02.487 position:50% align:center
Heh...

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.282 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:11.329 position:50% align:center
You're incredible! You got me!
Very impressive work there.

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:13.623 position:50% align:center
I never would have imagined
you'd twist my own words

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:15.458 position:50% align:center
into such a tangled knot!

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:16.876 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.005 position:50% align:center
The outcome is more abrupt
than I'd anticipated.

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:21.548 position:50% align:center
That's fine.

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:23.550 position:50% align:center
My purpose has
already been achieved.

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:26.511 position:50% align:center
And so, I'll stand down.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.477 position:50% align:center
No need to worry, that one over
there is merely unconscious--

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:35.812 position:50% align:center
he's not dead.

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:38.690 position:50% align:center
I expect to be arrested
on arrival at the airport,

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:41.192 position:50% align:center
but I haven't killed
anybody just yet.

00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:44.446 position:50% align:center
So, after a short stay
in the Big House,

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:46.656 position:50% align:center
I'll be right back out.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.701 position:50% align:center
So, he was right,
you were lying.

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:54.372 position:50% align:center
[BAT]
What are you trying to say?

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:56.916 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Oh, nothing.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.169 position:50% align:center
Here's the deal, Ms. Detective.

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:02.213 position:50% align:center
It's true--my real reasons
for trying to hijack this plane

00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:04.632 position:50% align:center
were indeed different
from the one you gave me.

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:07.093 position:50% align:center
But out of respect for your
boldness, I'm pretending to lose

00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:09.346 position:50% align:center
this time around, just for you.

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:12.265 position:50% align:center
Come on, don't make me
spell it all out.

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:13.808 position:50% align:center
That's still a win.

00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:16.644 position:50% align:center
So, I suggest we take a cue
from Bat's mature response here

00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:18.396 position:50% align:center
and return to our
seats, as well.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.775 position:50% align:center
No, you misunderstand--that's
not the lie I was talking about.

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:23.109 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA grunts]

00:07:23.193 --> 00:07:24.361 position:50% align:center
Earlier, you told me
that you didn't mind putting

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.988 position:50% align:center
your own life at risk
in a hijacking, Bat,

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:29.032 position:50% align:center
but that was a lie.

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:33.286 position:50% align:center
The truth is, you were
actually afraid of dying.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.164 position:50% align:center
[BAT]
What're you saying...?

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:38.208 position:50% align:center
You stood down far too quickly.

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:41.378 position:50% align:center
You admitted defeat and
gave up without even fighting.

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:44.464 position:50% align:center
Things as they are, there's no
way you single handedly hijacked

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:47.384 position:50% align:center
a plane, then cowardly
backed down when confronted

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:50.053 position:50% align:center
by a young girl
and her sidekick.

I suspect you did this
hijacking under some other

yourself have been ordered

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:59.729 position:50% align:center
to die, along with your victims,
in the ensuing plane crash.

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:02.565 position:50% align:center
The simple truth is you're
afraid and don't want to die,

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:05.276 position:50% align:center
and so, you used us as
a way to get out of a fate

been inescapable.

unnecessary theatrics.

Sadly, his pride would
never allow him that.

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:28.258 position:50% align:center

to be beaten fair and square.

I knew that this was the flight
you were going to be on,

SPES?

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:54.195 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] SPES produces androids

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:57.615 position:50% align:center

00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:01.536 position:50% align:center

In this case, it's only an ear.

00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:04.330 position:50% align:center
It would seem they've stolen
an experimental product

00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:06.291 position:50% align:center

a partial android.

Somehow, at times like this,

00:14:55.937 --> 00:14:58.023 position:50% align:center
I've always been able
to keep a clear head.

00:14:58.106 --> 00:15:00.108 position:50% align:center
As a natural born

00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:03.653 position:50% align:center
I've stumbled upon more scenes

it's about time

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.050 position:50% align:center
you accepted your

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:43.318 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] I have no idea what
that attaché case contains.

00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:48.156 position:50% align:center
However... My intuition is
rooted in past experiences,

00:15:48.239 --> 00:15:50.825 position:50% align:center
and I'm certain
this is the best solution!

00:15:50.909 --> 00:15:51.993 position:50% align:center
Now's your chance!

00:15:52.077 --> 00:15:53.495 position:50% align:center

Don't pat yourself on the back
too soon, Ace Detective!

00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:19.312 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] You're right, and yet,
from the moment I arrived,

00:16:19.396 --> 00:16:21.773 position:50% align:center
the incident has been
all but dealt with!

your cohorts won't be
looking for you.

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:01.187 position:50% align:center

can live out your life

[SIESTA] Not at all.
You don't want to die, right?

00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:11.531 position:50% align:center
The official report will say
you were killed while trying

00:17:11.614 --> 00:17:13.241 position:50% align:center
to evade capture.

00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:15.827 position:50% align:center
I have a contact in the police
we can count on.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:19.164 position:50% align:center
It'll be fine--
nobody will ever find out.

00:17:20.415 --> 00:17:24.002 position:50% align:center
If you don't end me here and
now, you are going to regret it.

00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:25.754 position:50% align:center
Why's that?

00:17:25.837 --> 00:17:27.297 position:50% align:center

Hmph.

Siesta, no!

00:17:36.431 --> 00:17:38.475 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] You see,
the bullet I shot you with...

00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:41.227 position:50% align:center
...was made from my own blood.

00:17:41.311 --> 00:17:43.229 position:50% align:center
Anyone who comes
in contact with it

00:17:43.313 --> 00:17:47.442 position:50% align:center
becomes utterly incapable
of turning against its donor.

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:49.652 position:50% align:center
Simply put, you will never
have the self-agency to raise

00:17:49.736 --> 00:17:53.281 position:50% align:center
an appendage against
me ever again.

00:17:53.365 --> 00:17:54.949 position:50% align:center
Where'd you learn
how to do that?

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:56.368 position:50% align:center
And who are you?

00:17:56.451 --> 00:17:58.870 position:50% align:center
I fear that's a trade secret.

00:17:58.953 --> 00:18:01.373 position:50% align:center
[BAT] Then at least tell me
who your employer is!

00:18:01.456 --> 00:18:03.583 position:50% align:center
There's no one.

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:05.585 position:50% align:center
I was just born to be
an Ace Detective,

00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:07.420 position:50% align:center
it's what's in my blood.

00:18:09.881 --> 00:18:11.508 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA gasps]

00:18:24.187 --> 00:18:25.980 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
I have a question.

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:29.734 position:50% align:center
About that specialized process
where you manipulated

00:18:29.818 --> 00:18:31.361 position:50% align:center
the gun's bullets...

00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:36.116 position:50% align:center
I'm still a bit confused--
when'd you find time to do that?

00:18:36.199 --> 00:18:38.034 position:50% align:center
Dear Kimi, you're slow.

00:18:38.118 --> 00:18:39.369 position:50% align:center
Ah?!

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:41.663 position:50% align:center
There's no way I would have
had the time for that.

00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:44.874 position:50% align:center
Instead, I made preparations
for it in advance.

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:46.918 position:50% align:center
But how could you have...?

00:18:47.002 --> 00:18:48.461 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:18:48.545 --> 00:18:50.714 position:50% align:center
Yes. If you're wondering who
ordered them to have you carry

00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:54.634 position:50% align:center
that attaché case onto
the plane, it was me.

00:18:54.718 --> 00:18:56.219 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Uh...

00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:59.848 position:50% align:center
Huh? Hold on, are you telling me
that you had me in your clutches

00:18:59.931 --> 00:19:01.474 position:50% align:center
from the beginning?

00:19:01.558 --> 00:19:03.059 position:50% align:center
If you really need
someone to blame,

00:19:03.143 --> 00:19:06.479 position:50% align:center
blame yourself for not seeing
the strings puppeteering you.

00:19:06.563 --> 00:19:09.566 position:50% align:center
Puppe-- [sighs]
This is absurd.

00:19:10.859 --> 00:19:14.446 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] All right, then,
why'd you give me--

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:16.197 position:50% align:center
What the...?

00:19:18.033 --> 00:19:19.617 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]

Man, I'm exhausted.

00:19:32.756 --> 00:19:36.051 position:50% align:center
Now that it's done,
what the hell was that?

Huh?

00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:02.369 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:20:09.084 --> 00:20:11.294 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] How many times
do I have to say it?

00:20:11.378 --> 00:20:13.672 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
I don't want to!

00:20:13.755 --> 00:20:15.465 position:50% align:center
Sorry? What'd you say?

00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:17.676 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] And stop pretending
that you can't hear me!

00:20:17.759 --> 00:20:20.011 position:50% align:center
I'm telling you, there's no way
I'm becoming your sidekick,

00:20:20.095 --> 00:20:22.055 position:50% align:center
no ifs ands or buts.

00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:25.100 position:50% align:center
I didn't quite catch that.

00:20:25.183 --> 00:20:26.518 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Ugh...

00:20:26.601 --> 00:20:29.688 position:50% align:center
I always thought bath time
was meant to be relaxing.

00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:32.107 position:50% align:center
Would it help if
I washed your back for you?

00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:34.943 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
No, thank you.

00:20:35.026 --> 00:20:37.570 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] Maybe I'll come in
wearing just a bath towel.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.158 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
No, thank you...

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:44.744 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] Don't think I didn't
note your hesitation just now.

00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:46.830 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA growls] That's not
fair, she's going straight

00:20:46.913 --> 00:20:50.041 position:50% align:center
for my weakness: the fact that
I'm a boy going through puberty.

00:20:50.125 --> 00:20:53.586 position:50% align:center
I've been saying, every single
day, and you heard me!

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.297 position:50% align:center
That's right! [growls]
For an entire week:

00:20:56.381 --> 00:20:58.675 position:50% align:center
You can't just barge into
somebody's house uninvited!

00:20:58.758 --> 00:21:01.261 position:50% align:center
And never try to come into
an occupied bathroom!

00:21:01.344 --> 00:21:03.430 position:50% align:center
The only reason I came here
is because you refused

00:21:03.513 --> 00:21:05.098 position:50% align:center
to hear my proposal.

00:21:05.181 --> 00:21:07.434 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Your "proposal"
isn't worth hearing out!

00:21:07.517 --> 00:21:09.728 position:50% align:center
I'm only saying I want you to
fly around the world with me

00:21:09.811 --> 00:21:13.148 position:50% align:center
and serve as the sidekick to
a "Legendary Detective," c'mon.

00:21:13.231 --> 00:21:14.733 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] That request
is insane, therefore,

00:21:14.816 --> 00:21:17.110 position:50% align:center
I can only respond with a "no."

00:21:17.193 --> 00:21:19.946 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
No need to get so emotional.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.865 position:50% align:center
You do understand that just
showing up at your house

00:21:21.948 --> 00:21:24.409 position:50% align:center
like this, it's not easy
for me, either?

00:21:24.492 --> 00:21:26.411 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Huh? You invite
yourself over, then act

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:28.788 position:50% align:center
like it's my fault for
the inconvenience?

00:21:28.872 --> 00:21:31.416 position:50% align:center
And besides, I'm pretty sure
I locked the door.

00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:35.086 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] I took it upon myself
to open it with a skeleton key.

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:37.922 position:50% align:center
It happens to be one of my
signature "seven tools."

00:21:38.006 --> 00:21:40.842 position:50% align:center
I haven't found a lock that
this little guy can't open yet.

00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:42.177 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Great,
so breaking and entering

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.012 position:50% align:center
is just one of your hobbies!

00:21:44.095 --> 00:21:46.348 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA grunts]
That was uncalled for.

00:21:46.431 --> 00:21:48.016 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] It can't be
as uncalled for as invading

00:21:48.099 --> 00:21:50.727 position:50% align:center
another person's privacy.

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:52.270 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
And so?

00:21:52.354 --> 00:21:55.815 position:50% align:center
Why are you so averse to the
idea of becoming my sidekick?

00:21:58.234 --> 00:22:00.653 position:50% align:center
[sighs] It's just in one ear
and out the other.

00:22:00.737 --> 00:22:03.198 position:50% align:center
As far back as I can remember,
my knack for getting tangled up

00:22:03.281 --> 00:22:05.909 position:50% align:center
in trouble has only
brought misery.

00:22:05.992 --> 00:22:08.703 position:50% align:center
So I have this dream where I
lead a nice, uneventful life,

00:22:08.787 --> 00:22:10.497 position:50% align:center
ya know, like the
existential equivalent of

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:13.083 position:50% align:center
bathing in lukewarm water.

00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:14.918 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] And you're
saying that, with me,

00:22:15.001 --> 00:22:16.920 position:50% align:center
you wouldn't be able
to live that life?

00:22:17.003 --> 00:22:18.505 position:50% align:center
Clearly...

00:22:22.634 --> 00:22:23.968 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Nine lives
wouldn't begin to cover me

00:22:24.052 --> 00:22:26.638 position:50% align:center
if I got involved in
the kind of work you do...

00:22:26.721 --> 00:22:29.766 position:50% align:center
You have to understand--
this specific line of work...

00:22:29.849 --> 00:22:31.476 position:50% align:center
...only I can do.

00:22:32.686 --> 00:22:35.063 position:50% align:center
Okay, so what's the point
in bringing me along

00:22:35.146 --> 00:22:37.399 position:50% align:center
if only you can do it?

00:22:37.482 --> 00:22:39.776 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
The point...

00:22:39.859 --> 00:22:41.319 position:50% align:center
Oh! I know!

00:22:41.403 --> 00:22:43.822 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] You're gonna say
something you just thought up.

00:22:43.905 --> 00:22:45.865 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] I was utterly taken
with you at first sight.

00:22:45.949 --> 00:22:48.284 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on! The first time you
arranged for us to meet,

00:22:48.368 --> 00:22:51.788 position:50% align:center
you didn't quite recognize
my face, or don't you remember?

00:22:51.871 --> 00:22:53.998 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] It's true, your face
is completely forgettable

00:22:54.082 --> 00:22:55.917 position:50% align:center
if you haven't
seen it in a while.

00:22:56.001 --> 00:22:57.627 position:50% align:center
Perfect for covert action.

00:22:57.711 --> 00:23:00.130 position:50% align:center
Stop insulting me with
backhanded compliments.

00:23:00.213 --> 00:23:02.590 position:50% align:center
And for the last time
stop assigning me tasks

00:23:02.674 --> 00:23:04.342 position:50% align:center
as your sidekick.

00:23:05.385 --> 00:23:07.345 position:50% align:center
You really won't do it?

00:23:07.429 --> 00:23:09.055 position:50% align:center
Won't be my sidekick?

00:23:09.139 --> 00:23:11.558 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Why are you getting
disappointed all of the sudden?

00:23:13.101 --> 00:23:16.104 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Look, if we're
negotiating, you could lay out

00:23:16.187 --> 00:23:18.773 position:50% align:center
the merits of the job,
at the very least.

00:23:18.857 --> 00:23:21.693 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA chuckles]
I didn't expect you to fold

00:23:21.776 --> 00:23:23.570 position:50% align:center
so easily, Kimi.

00:23:23.653 --> 00:23:25.155 position:50% align:center
Don't be so sure.

00:23:25.238 --> 00:23:28.074 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] That reminds me: I just
ordered a pizza for delivery.

00:23:28.158 --> 00:23:29.492 position:50% align:center
Hope that's all right.

00:23:29.576 --> 00:23:31.494 position:50% align:center
Will you stop taking advantage
of my forgiving nature?

00:23:31.578 --> 00:23:33.204 position:50% align:center
That's the fifth time this week!

00:23:33.288 --> 00:23:35.832 position:50% align:center
Call them right now
and cancel it!

00:23:35.915 --> 00:23:38.043 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] Allow me to
make a little prediction:

00:23:38.126 --> 00:23:40.837 position:50% align:center
I think that a year from today,
we'll be celebrating

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.340 position:50% align:center
the anniversary
of our great friendship.

00:23:43.423 --> 00:23:45.175 position:50% align:center
We are not celebrating anything!

00:23:45.258 --> 00:23:47.093 position:50% align:center
For the record, I, for one,
have been stressed out

00:23:47.177 --> 00:23:49.637 position:50% align:center
this entire time!

00:23:49.721 --> 00:23:51.890 position:50% align:center
So, since you're finished...

00:23:51.973 --> 00:23:54.351 position:50% align:center
...just tell me what you think.

00:23:54.434 --> 00:23:57.395 position:50% align:center
Wait, that's not right--
we were at the point

00:23:57.479 --> 00:23:59.356 position:50% align:center
where you were going to lay
out the merits and benefits

00:23:59.439 --> 00:24:01.608 position:50% align:center
of taking this
particular gig.

00:24:01.691 --> 00:24:03.985 position:50% align:center
Is there something
you're worried about?

00:24:04.069 --> 00:24:05.487 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:08.031 position:50% align:center
One merit of coming to
work for me as my sidekick,

00:24:08.114 --> 00:24:10.742 position:50% align:center
is that I can assuage you
of all of those worries.

00:24:10.825 --> 00:24:12.911 position:50% align:center
You're going to reassure me
about the things that trouble me

00:24:12.994 --> 00:24:16.581 position:50% align:center
about the job?
That's the compensation package?

00:24:16.664 --> 00:24:18.375 position:50% align:center
We can at least work from there.

00:24:19.501 --> 00:24:22.671 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA sighs]
And now the next point.

00:24:22.754 --> 00:24:24.339 position:50% align:center
If you've seen
a certain something,

00:24:24.422 --> 00:24:27.175 position:50% align:center
could you at least react
like you've seen it?

00:24:28.009 --> 00:24:29.469 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:24:29.552 --> 00:24:32.514 position:50% align:center
I did notice, but it doesn't
hold my attention because, well,

00:24:32.597 --> 00:24:34.599 position:50% align:center
I'm thinking more
about the pizza.

00:24:36.351 --> 00:24:38.478 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] It's weird,
at my school right now,

00:24:38.561 --> 00:24:39.646 position:50% align:center
we're having a big time

00:24:39.729 --> 00:24:41.940 position:50% align:center
"Hanako-san of
the Toilet" outbreak.

00:24:42.023 --> 00:24:43.608 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:24:46.111 --> 00:24:48.863 position:50% align:center
So a little "Toilet-Bound
Hanako" mischief?

00:24:48.947 --> 00:24:50.115 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:24:50.198 --> 00:24:52.033 position:50% align:center
That's just one of those
ludicrous urban legends

00:24:52.117 --> 00:24:54.953 position:50% align:center
you hear about from
schools all over Japan.

00:24:56.371 --> 00:24:59.165 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] If you knock three
times at three in the morning

00:24:59.249 --> 00:25:02.043 position:50% align:center
on the third girls' stall in
the restroom on the third floor

00:25:02.127 --> 00:25:04.504 position:50% align:center
of the old
schoolhouse building...

00:25:06.756 --> 00:25:08.675 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] ...a girl in a red
skirt with suspenders

00:25:08.758 --> 00:25:10.593 position:50% align:center
will manifest out
of nothingness...

00:25:10.677 --> 00:25:11.845 position:50% align:center
[GIRL screams]

00:25:11.928 --> 00:25:13.263 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] ...and drag
you down the toilet,

00:25:13.346 --> 00:25:16.266 position:50% align:center
never to be seen again.

00:25:16.349 --> 00:25:17.851 position:50% align:center
It's utter nonsense.

00:25:17.934 --> 00:25:20.353 position:50% align:center
A hackneyed, outdated schoolyard
rumor that would, in most cases,

00:25:20.437 --> 00:25:22.772 position:50% align:center
not be worth bringing up
in this day and age.

00:25:22.856 --> 00:25:25.066 position:50% align:center
And yet, I get the feeling the
situation is a little different

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:26.484 position:50% align:center
at your school.

00:25:26.568 --> 00:25:28.028 position:50% align:center
For sure.

00:25:31.531 --> 00:25:33.116 position:50% align:center
Listen, Siesta.

00:25:33.199 --> 00:25:34.743 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Hmm?

00:25:34.826 --> 00:25:37.579 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Stop flipping through
magazines about foreign dramas,

00:25:37.662 --> 00:25:39.330 position:50% align:center
while eating pizza
in the home of a guy

00:25:39.414 --> 00:25:41.541 position:50% align:center
you just met, while
also casually wearing

00:25:41.624 --> 00:25:43.168 position:50% align:center
said guy's loungewear.

00:25:43.251 --> 00:25:44.419 position:50% align:center
Are you like
a surprise girlfriend

00:25:44.502 --> 00:25:45.712 position:50% align:center
who's living with me now?

00:25:45.795 --> 00:25:47.464 position:50% align:center
What? Of course not.

00:25:47.547 --> 00:25:50.550 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know, that's why
I'm complaining.

00:25:50.633 --> 00:25:53.053 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] So, let's get back to
this whole "Hanako" thing.

00:25:53.136 --> 00:25:55.722 position:50% align:center
Sure, but don't be
so casual about it.

00:25:55.805 --> 00:25:57.182 position:50% align:center
The way you said it
made it sound like

00:25:57.265 --> 00:25:59.517 position:50% align:center
you're on friendly terms.

00:25:59.601 --> 00:26:01.895 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] So the gist is that
Hanako related incidents

00:26:01.978 --> 00:26:03.938 position:50% align:center
are on the rise at
your middle school, yeah?

00:26:04.022 --> 00:26:07.817 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Yeah. Apparently, any
student who meets a Hanako-san

00:26:07.901 --> 00:26:10.320 position:50% align:center
winds up becoming
a Hanako-san themselves.

00:26:10.403 --> 00:26:13.239 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] I get it, it's
the same way with zombies.

00:26:13.323 --> 00:26:15.867 position:50% align:center
One bites you,
you become a zombie, too.

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:17.535 position:50% align:center
Bah!

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:19.996 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:22.832 position:50% align:center
But in this case, it appears
to be more than just

00:26:22.916 --> 00:26:24.876 position:50% align:center
a rumor at your school.
otherwise, I doubt

00:26:24.959 --> 00:26:27.045 position:50% align:center
you would have brought it up
in conversation.

00:26:27.128 --> 00:26:29.631 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you've got
that part right.

00:26:29.714 --> 00:26:32.133 position:50% align:center
But still, lately I've
noticed an increase

00:26:32.217 --> 00:26:33.802 position:50% align:center
in students skipping.

00:26:33.885 --> 00:26:36.054 position:50% align:center
Most of them were with
the track and field club.

00:26:36.137 --> 00:26:37.681 position:50% align:center
And it's more than
just skipping school--

00:26:37.764 --> 00:26:40.392 position:50% align:center
some of them have even started
disappearing from their homes.

00:26:40.475 --> 00:26:42.727 position:50% align:center
Now the rumor going around your
school is that this "Hanako"

00:26:42.811 --> 00:26:44.938 position:50% align:center
is the one behind
all this, right?

00:26:45.021 --> 00:26:46.815 position:50% align:center
If the urban legend
is to be believed,

00:26:46.898 --> 00:26:48.316 position:50% align:center
she must have dragged
the missing students

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.859 position:50% align:center
down the toilet.

00:26:49.943 --> 00:26:51.778 position:50% align:center
Bingo. And from the fact that
the number of disappearances

00:26:51.861 --> 00:26:54.155 position:50% align:center
have increased so rapidly,
the suspicion is that

00:26:54.239 --> 00:26:57.409 position:50% align:center
the actual number of
Hanako-sans is on the rise.

00:26:57.492 --> 00:26:59.494 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] Hmm. Hence
the previously mentioned

00:26:59.577 --> 00:27:01.705 position:50% align:center
"Hanako outbreak."

00:27:04.249 --> 00:27:06.084 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
You have a kind heart.

00:27:06.167 --> 00:27:08.461 position:50% align:center
Thanks, but you still have
to pay me back for the pizza.

00:27:08.545 --> 00:27:10.547 position:50% align:center
Oh, I wasn't saying that at all.

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:12.757 position:50% align:center
I've no intention
of paying for the pizza.

00:27:12.841 --> 00:27:14.676 position:50% align:center
Oh, you're gonna.

00:27:14.759 --> 00:27:17.053 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] The students you say
disappeared from your school--

00:27:17.137 --> 00:27:19.723 position:50% align:center
you obviously weren't
friends with them...

00:27:19.806 --> 00:27:21.725 position:50% align:center
...but you're still concerned
about it and want to put an end

00:27:21.808 --> 00:27:23.810 position:50% align:center
to whatever's causing
the issue, right?

00:27:23.893 --> 00:27:25.478 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA growls] I don't
appreciate you talking

00:27:25.562 --> 00:27:28.732 position:50% align:center
as if it's an obvious fact
that I have no friends!

00:27:28.815 --> 00:27:29.899 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
I wonder if it's because

00:27:29.983 --> 00:27:32.861 position:50% align:center
you're a self-described
trouble-magnet?

00:27:32.944 --> 00:27:34.863 position:50% align:center
And yet, at the same time,
helping other people

00:27:34.946 --> 00:27:36.990 position:50% align:center
is ingrained in your nature.

00:27:37.073 --> 00:27:39.784 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Another part of
my DNA I could do without.

00:27:40.785 --> 00:27:44.414 position:50% align:center
But still, when it comes to
the world that I interact with,

00:27:44.497 --> 00:27:47.834 position:50% align:center
I'll do whatever I can
to keep things tranquil.

00:27:47.917 --> 00:27:50.962 position:50% align:center
My parents vanished before
I was even aware of them.

00:27:51.046 --> 00:27:53.757 position:50% align:center
After moving from place to
place, various foster houses

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.968 position:50% align:center
and facilities,
I'm now living alone.

00:27:57.052 --> 00:28:00.430 position:50% align:center
That would make anybody seek out
a tranquil, stable environment.

00:28:00.513 --> 00:28:02.474 position:50% align:center
At least, that's
the way I see it.

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:06.936 position:50% align:center
It makes sense.
Which means that's your...

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:09.439 position:50% align:center
Mm. Yes, that
explains everything!

00:28:09.522 --> 00:28:11.399 position:50% align:center
Uh. If you understand
everything about me

00:28:11.483 --> 00:28:13.777 position:50% align:center
after one conversation,
I'm terrified.

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.195 position:50% align:center
You must be lonely,
living a life

00:28:15.278 --> 00:28:16.905 position:50% align:center
with no family or
friends, right?

00:28:16.988 --> 00:28:19.115 position:50% align:center
Wait! At what point
did I ever even insinuate

00:28:19.199 --> 00:28:20.700 position:50% align:center
that I don't have any friends?

00:28:20.784 --> 00:28:22.702 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
With that topic in mind...

00:28:24.079 --> 00:28:26.790 position:50% align:center
I think we should go
to this over the weekend.

00:28:26.873 --> 00:28:28.375 position:50% align:center
A culture festival?

00:28:28.458 --> 00:28:29.542 position:50% align:center
Whatever happened
to looking into

00:28:29.626 --> 00:28:31.753 position:50% align:center
the whole Hanako-san situation?

00:28:31.836 --> 00:28:33.213 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Hmm.

00:28:44.057 --> 00:28:46.935 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] What is this?
A Culture Festival?

00:28:47.018 --> 00:28:48.853 position:50% align:center
How've I not heard
about this thing?

00:28:48.937 --> 00:28:50.689 position:50% align:center
Seriously though,
I've been at school,

00:28:50.772 --> 00:28:53.858 position:50% align:center
but I can't remember helping
with any preparations.

00:28:53.942 --> 00:28:55.735 position:50% align:center
Don't festivals always
involve working together

00:28:55.819 --> 00:28:58.196 position:50% align:center
as a homeroom class
to prepare an exhibit?

00:28:58.279 --> 00:29:00.740 position:50% align:center
Did they finish when I was
absent or something?

00:29:00.824 --> 00:29:03.118 position:50% align:center
Did I miss out on this bonding
experience due to being

00:29:03.201 --> 00:29:05.328 position:50% align:center
caught up in any
number of fiascoes?

00:29:05.412 --> 00:29:08.623 position:50% align:center
And why didn't anyone think to
tell me that I'd missed out?!

00:29:10.125 --> 00:29:11.668 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Sorry I'm late.

00:29:16.965 --> 00:29:19.551 position:50% align:center
Siesta, that outfit
you've got on it's so--!

00:29:19.634 --> 00:29:22.220 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] Hmm? Oh, yeah,
it's different from

00:29:22.303 --> 00:29:24.097 position:50% align:center
what I'm normally wearing.

00:29:24.889 --> 00:29:27.684 position:50% align:center
Look, I even put a ribbon
in my hair as an accent!

00:29:27.767 --> 00:29:29.019 position:50% align:center
Like it?

00:29:29.102 --> 00:29:30.478 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA gulps]

00:29:33.356 --> 00:29:36.609 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] Why'd you
turn away all of a sudden?

00:29:36.693 --> 00:29:38.028 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
I had to.

00:29:38.111 --> 00:29:40.697 position:50% align:center
Because of the possibility
that, if I wasn't careful,

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:43.658 position:50% align:center
I'd let slip that she looked
really pretty in that uniform.

00:29:43.742 --> 00:29:45.201 position:50% align:center
But that felt like
admitting defeat,

00:29:45.285 --> 00:29:47.203 position:50% align:center
so I didn't want to say it.

00:29:47.287 --> 00:29:49.748 position:50% align:center
Why are you wearing
our uniform anyway?

00:29:49.831 --> 00:29:53.001 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] Oh, that's all
quite simple, Kimi.

00:29:53.084 --> 00:29:55.003 position:50% align:center
 I just thought dressing
up in uniform for

00:29:55.086 --> 00:29:57.714 position:50% align:center
our Culture Festival date
sounded like fun!

00:29:59.007 --> 00:30:00.884 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA gasps]

00:30:00.967 --> 00:30:02.469 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:30:05.847 --> 00:30:07.640 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
It's so blue.

00:30:07.724 --> 00:30:10.018 position:50% align:center
Yup.

00:30:10.101 --> 00:30:13.146 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] So, why are you
staring up at the sky?

00:30:13.229 --> 00:30:15.106 position:50% align:center
[sizzling]

00:30:17.317 --> 00:30:20.278 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Well? Where should
we start our walkaround?

00:30:20.362 --> 00:30:23.698 position:50% align:center
Food stalls and a planetarium...

00:30:23.782 --> 00:30:26.951 position:50% align:center
Ooh. So the haunted house
is in the old building.

00:30:27.035 --> 00:30:28.953 position:50% align:center
We've got to check that out.

00:30:29.037 --> 00:30:30.914 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but we should look
over the schedule before

00:30:30.997 --> 00:30:32.332 position:50% align:center
we make any decisions.

00:30:32.415 --> 00:30:35.168 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Uh. Hey!

00:30:35.251 --> 00:30:36.753 position:50% align:center
A question about
the haunted house--

00:30:36.836 --> 00:30:38.880 position:50% align:center
can visitors get in
during off-hours?

00:30:38.963 --> 00:30:41.257 position:50% align:center
Really, Siesta?
It's on the front:

00:30:41.341 --> 00:30:44.719 position:50% align:center
"No entry during operations
staff lunch break."

00:30:44.803 --> 00:30:47.472 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] But according to
the ideal itinerary I drew up

00:30:47.555 --> 00:30:51.393 position:50% align:center
in my brain, going in at that
time would work out the best.

00:30:51.476 --> 00:30:53.478 position:50% align:center
I want to be fortified
with food, first,

00:30:53.561 --> 00:30:55.563 position:50% align:center
from the heaping-helping
challenge, naturally.

00:30:55.647 --> 00:31:00.068 position:50% align:center
Not the typical planning middle
schoolers do on a Festival day.

00:31:00.151 --> 00:31:01.945 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
And that is why...

00:31:02.028 --> 00:31:05.156 position:50% align:center
...if it's off-hours,
we'd appreciate some help.

00:31:06.408 --> 00:31:09.119 position:50% align:center
Come along now, sidekick.
I could really go for a crepe.

00:31:09.202 --> 00:31:10.328 position:50% align:center
--Hey!
--[SIESTA giggles]

00:31:10.412 --> 00:31:11.996 position:50% align:center
Wait!

00:31:12.831 --> 00:31:14.874 position:50% align:center
[VENDOR 1A]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:31:14.958 --> 00:31:17.043 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
You know, Siesta.

00:31:17.127 --> 00:31:19.295 position:50% align:center
It's not a good idea to push
your absurd demands

00:31:19.379 --> 00:31:20.880 position:50% align:center
on people that aren't me.

00:31:20.964 --> 00:31:24.175 position:50% align:center
Okay, you bought this for me
without even saying anything,

00:31:24.259 --> 00:31:26.177 position:50% align:center
and yet, just the other day,
you got upset when

00:31:26.261 --> 00:31:28.805 position:50% align:center
I ordered that pizza.
Is there something going on?

00:31:28.888 --> 00:31:33.184 position:50% align:center
It's because the situation
keeps changing, hour by hour.

00:31:33.268 --> 00:31:35.770 position:50% align:center
I prefer the sweet
festival experience

00:31:35.854 --> 00:31:38.732 position:50% align:center
to the elusive Hanako-san.

00:31:38.815 --> 00:31:42.444 position:50% align:center
Time for the Kimizuka
rom-com bazooka.

00:31:48.908 --> 00:31:49.868 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Hmm? 

00:31:49.951 --> 00:31:51.828 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Mm?

00:31:51.911 --> 00:31:53.413 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait.

00:31:53.496 --> 00:31:55.874 position:50% align:center
You don't actually think having
this little date means that you

00:31:55.957 --> 00:31:58.626 position:50% align:center
and I are "together" or anything
like that, now do you?

00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:59.836 position:50% align:center
What? No way.

00:31:59.919 --> 00:32:01.254 position:50% align:center
You're so funny.

00:32:01.338 --> 00:32:04.758 position:50% align:center
Not thinking that.
Of course not.

00:32:04.841 --> 00:32:07.010 position:50% align:center
Not even a little...

00:32:07.093 --> 00:32:09.179 position:50% align:center
Don't be a moron, Kimi.

00:32:10.472 --> 00:32:11.848 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA gasps]

00:32:11.931 --> 00:32:14.517 position:50% align:center
Now let's go get
some of that takoyaki.

00:32:20.774 --> 00:32:22.275 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] This sudden
closeness is creating

00:32:22.359 --> 00:32:24.903 position:50% align:center
all kinds of misunderstandings.

00:32:24.986 --> 00:32:27.947 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS murmuring]

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:30.492 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 1B]
This morning went really great!

00:32:30.575 --> 00:32:32.577 position:50% align:center
Let's bring that same energy
to this afternoon.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:34.496 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 1C]
Sure, just let me refuel!

00:32:34.579 --> 00:32:37.207 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Okay, third stall
in the third-floor restroom

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:41.086 position:50% align:center
of the old schoolhouse.
The stage is set for Hanako-san.

00:32:41.169 --> 00:32:45.965 position:50% align:center
And we're sitting ducks, waiting
in a single toilet stall.

00:32:46.049 --> 00:32:48.051 position:50% align:center
Remind me again
why we're doing this?

00:32:48.134 --> 00:32:50.679 position:50% align:center
There's something that
I wanted to investigate.

00:32:50.762 --> 00:32:51.805 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:32:51.888 --> 00:32:54.224 position:50% align:center

If my suspicions are correct...

[KIMIZUKA whimpers, gulps]

00:32:56.142 --> 00:32:58.186 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
There!

00:32:58.269 --> 00:33:01.022 position:50% align:center
What's your assessment of this?

00:33:01.106 --> 00:33:03.525 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Now let's see...
A packet of medicine?

00:33:03.608 --> 00:33:05.235 position:50% align:center
It looks like a student
might have taken it

00:33:05.318 --> 00:33:07.654 position:50% align:center
after eating in here, maybe?

00:33:07.737 --> 00:33:09.739 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] I can't stop myself
from feeling extreme

00:33:09.823 --> 00:33:11.741 position:50% align:center
sympathy for you,
if that's the very first thing

00:33:11.825 --> 00:33:13.868 position:50% align:center
to pop into your mind.

[footsteps]

00:33:16.788 --> 00:33:19.582 position:50% align:center
Tell me something, Kimi--
this stable life you want

00:33:19.666 --> 00:33:21.584 position:50% align:center
wouldn't happen to involve
you and a bento box

00:33:21.668 --> 00:33:23.461 position:50% align:center
all alone in the
restroom, would it?

00:33:23.545 --> 00:33:26.172 position:50% align:center
No, if you'll recall, both of
my parents have been missing

00:33:26.256 --> 00:33:28.216 position:50% align:center
for a while, so nobody's
ever been there

00:33:28.299 --> 00:33:30.510 position:50% align:center
to prepare a bento box for me.

00:33:30.593 --> 00:33:32.387 position:50% align:center
The only lunch I've ever
eaten alone in the restroom

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:33.972 position:50% align:center
is a pastry.

Okay, well, now you've got me
feeling really sorry for you.

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:38.935 position:50% align:center
Would you like me to
make a bento box for you

every now and again?

[footstep]

00:33:42.147 --> 00:33:44.107 position:50% align:center
Hey. I thought I asked you
not to say things

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:45.275 position:50% align:center

misconstrued--

[gasps]

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.835 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] I remember you,
in the schoolyard,

00:34:03.918 --> 00:34:05.253 position:50% align:center
passing out flyers.

00:34:05.337 --> 00:34:08.048 position:50% align:center
But why would you come
all the way up to this restroom?

00:34:09.007 --> 00:34:10.175 position:50% align:center
You won't get away.

00:34:10.258 --> 00:34:11.634 position:50% align:center
What?

00:34:13.678 --> 00:34:15.555 position:50% align:center
Hey! What's going on?!

00:34:15.638 --> 00:34:18.558 position:50% align:center
That rabbit is your school's
"Toiletbound Hanako-san."

Huh? No way.

00:34:33.031 --> 00:34:34.866 position:50% align:center
I guess you could say
the best place to hide a tree

00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:35.992 position:50% align:center
is the forest.

00:34:36.076 --> 00:34:37.285 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:34:37.369 --> 00:34:39.621 position:50% align:center
And why'd you say that
rabbit is our Hanako-san?

00:34:39.704 --> 00:34:40.997 position:50% align:center
I'll explain later.

00:34:41.081 --> 00:34:43.541 position:50% align:center
First, we have to track down
that creepy cottontail.

00:34:43.625 --> 00:34:45.919 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:34:46.002 --> 00:34:48.880 position:50% align:center
Sorry if this is anticlimactic,

00:34:48.963 --> 00:34:50.757 position:50% align:center
but is that him?

00:34:52.467 --> 00:34:53.760 position:50% align:center
If he'd just acted casual,

00:34:53.843 --> 00:34:55.887 position:50% align:center
I never would have
recognized him.

00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:57.972 position:50% align:center
Right, let's snatch that floof!

00:34:58.056 --> 00:35:00.266 position:50% align:center
It's really great to see you
so motivated and on board

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:01.476 position:50% align:center
with our mission.

00:35:01.559 --> 00:35:03.603 position:50% align:center
See what can happen
when you actually try?

00:35:03.687 --> 00:35:06.231 position:50% align:center
Wait, what the heck do you mean,
"when I try"?

00:35:06.314 --> 00:35:08.525 position:50% align:center
You're attempting to start
some sidekick training project.

00:35:08.608 --> 00:35:10.193 position:50% align:center
I know what you're up to!

00:35:10.276 --> 00:35:11.486 position:50% align:center

[KIMIZUKA]
If we had the time,

00:35:21.496 --> 00:35:24.082 position:50% align:center
this would've been my chance
to see Siesta in a maid costume

00:35:24.165 --> 00:35:25.959 position:50% align:center
with cat ears.

00:35:27.168 --> 00:35:30.296 position:50% align:center

My bad luck strikes again...

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:32.173 position:50% align:center
I need costumes for two, please.

[KIMIZUKA] You want us
to try something on?!

Isn't he gonna get away?

00:35:35.844 --> 00:35:38.138 position:50% align:center
This is a tactical maneuver.

00:35:38.221 --> 00:35:40.724 position:50% align:center
If our enemy is trying to use
a crowd of people in costumes

00:35:40.807 --> 00:35:44.019 position:50% align:center
as a cover, the sound
strategy is to use cosplay

00:35:44.102 --> 00:35:45.520 position:50% align:center
to blend in as well.

00:35:45.603 --> 00:35:47.689 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Do you really
think that's going to work?

00:35:47.772 --> 00:35:49.232 position:50% align:center
Seems like a maid with
cat ears would catch

00:35:49.315 --> 00:35:51.359 position:50% align:center
everyone's attention
immediately.

00:35:51.443 --> 00:35:52.736 position:50% align:center

[SIESTA] I'm curious.
What made you assume

00:35:58.283 --> 00:36:00.785 position:50% align:center
I was going to be
a maid with cat ears?

00:36:00.869 --> 00:36:02.662 position:50% align:center
That's a hard no.

Yeah, it's good. I mean...
that dress really suits you.

00:36:38.365 --> 00:36:41.951 position:50% align:center
I never would have guessed
you'd just come out and say it.

00:36:42.035 --> 00:36:46.206 position:50% align:center
Fair, but I couldn't lie
about it even if I tried.

00:36:46.289 --> 00:36:49.000 position:50% align:center
True. Oh, and by the way...

00:36:49.084 --> 00:36:51.252 position:50% align:center

Uh. Well, I...

00:37:02.472 --> 00:37:04.307 position:50% align:center

Nope, no time for that!

00:37:16.111 --> 00:37:18.029 position:50% align:center
We're in hot pursuit
of that sketchy rabbit!

00:37:18.113 --> 00:37:19.823 position:50% align:center
Seems we spent
too much time leaning into

00:37:19.906 --> 00:37:22.075 position:50% align:center
the romantic comedy.

00:37:22.158 --> 00:37:24.494 position:50% align:center
This dress makes it
much harder to run.

00:37:24.577 --> 00:37:26.037 position:50% align:center
Well, of course.

00:37:28.415 --> 00:37:29.833 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Maybe she got
confused and thinks this is

00:37:29.916 --> 00:37:31.543 position:50% align:center
some kind of cosplay event?

00:37:31.626 --> 00:37:33.211 position:50% align:center
--[SIESTA] Hey!
--[KIMIZUKA] Mm.

00:37:33.294 --> 00:37:35.588 position:50% align:center
This is fun, Sidekick!

[KIMIZUKA gasps]

00:37:38.174 --> 00:37:39.926 position:50% align:center
Who you callin' Sidekick, lady?!

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:42.095 position:50% align:center
Oops, you caught me.

00:37:43.638 --> 00:37:45.557 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Sidekick, look!

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.767 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Hmm?

00:37:47.851 --> 00:37:49.894 position:50% align:center
The bunny's making
a break for it!

00:37:52.313 --> 00:37:53.398 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait a second.

00:37:53.481 --> 00:37:56.026 position:50% align:center
I don't think this
is a good idea.

00:37:56.109 --> 00:37:57.610 position:50% align:center
I've gotta be mistaken--

00:37:57.694 --> 00:38:00.238 position:50% align:center
You aren't planning to jump from
here and chase him on your own?

00:38:00.321 --> 00:38:01.906 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
No, of course not.

00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:04.367 position:50% align:center
I thought so,
you're too smart for that.

00:38:04.451 --> 00:38:06.327 position:50% align:center
The way you phrased it
implied you wouldn't also be

00:38:06.411 --> 00:38:07.912 position:50% align:center
coming down with me.

00:38:07.996 --> 00:38:09.372 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:38:09.456 --> 00:38:11.249 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] It's fine.
The shoes I'm wearing today

00:38:11.332 --> 00:38:13.126 position:50% align:center
are another one of
the signature "seven tools"

00:38:13.209 --> 00:38:15.337 position:50% align:center
of the legendary
detective's trade.

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:17.547 position:50% align:center
But... Uh...

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:19.924 position:50% align:center
It means that we can fly.

00:38:26.264 --> 00:38:28.391 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:38:28.475 --> 00:38:30.143 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA sighs]

00:38:32.145 --> 00:38:33.772 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:38:39.402 --> 00:38:41.112 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] This is the drug the
students who stopped coming

00:38:41.196 --> 00:38:44.115 position:50% align:center
to your school were buying.

00:38:44.199 --> 00:38:46.409 position:50% align:center
They were using it
to elevate their moods,

00:38:46.493 --> 00:38:48.995 position:50% align:center
as well as improve
their concentration.

00:38:49.079 --> 00:38:50.622 position:50% align:center
So it was starting
to become popular,

00:38:50.705 --> 00:38:53.208 position:50% align:center
mostly with the students
in the track and field club.

00:38:53.291 --> 00:38:55.585 position:50% align:center
Yet I never had
the faintest idea.

00:38:55.669 --> 00:38:58.338 position:50% align:center
Cases of memory impairment
have also been reported to occur

00:38:58.421 --> 00:39:00.924 position:50% align:center
as a known side
effect of the drug.

00:39:01.007 --> 00:39:02.342 position:50% align:center
And according to what
you're telling me,

00:39:02.425 --> 00:39:03.927 position:50% align:center
that's why the students
who used it are now

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:06.846 position:50% align:center
skipping school regularly.

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:09.766 position:50% align:center
The addicted students turn to
selling it to earn enough money

00:39:09.849 --> 00:39:13.978 position:50% align:center
to pay for their own. Then the
cycle repeats itself again.

00:39:16.356 --> 00:39:19.025 position:50% align:center
I believe this to be the root
cause of the rapid proliferation

00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:21.111 position:50% align:center
of Hanakos of late.

00:39:21.194 --> 00:39:22.570 position:50% align:center
And as slang,
the black market used

00:39:22.654 --> 00:39:24.698 position:50% align:center
the Hanako-san
urban legend.

00:39:24.781 --> 00:39:28.368 position:50% align:center
Something most Japanese teens
would be familiar with.

00:39:28.451 --> 00:39:31.329 position:50% align:center
In fact, the main ingredient
in this illicit drug

00:39:31.413 --> 00:39:33.581 position:50% align:center
is apparently a pollen-like
substance that comes from

00:39:33.665 --> 00:39:36.501 position:50% align:center
a specific flowering plant.

00:39:36.584 --> 00:39:40.588 position:50% align:center
Pollen... That's where Hanako,
meaning "flower girl," comes in.

00:39:40.672 --> 00:39:43.133 position:50% align:center
That's some pretty
lame wordplay.

00:39:43.216 --> 00:39:44.676 position:50% align:center
But according to the legend,

00:39:44.759 --> 00:39:47.303 position:50% align:center
isn't the ghost's spirit only
supposed to appear at 3 AM?

00:39:47.387 --> 00:39:51.599 position:50% align:center
Why would they risk showing up
at the culture festival?

00:39:51.683 --> 00:39:54.060 position:50% align:center
So they could blend in
with the crowd.

00:39:54.144 --> 00:39:56.479 position:50% align:center
And what's more, they could
easily disguise their identity

00:39:56.563 --> 00:39:59.899 position:50% align:center
with a costume, allowing them
to get the jump on rivals and

00:39:59.983 --> 00:40:02.068 position:50% align:center
spread the drug
around untouched.

00:40:02.152 --> 00:40:03.486 position:50% align:center
That makes sense.

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:05.280 position:50% align:center
And something must have
tipped you off from the start,

00:40:05.363 --> 00:40:07.532 position:50% align:center
'cause you could tell right away
that rabbit was up to something,

00:40:07.615 --> 00:40:09.034 position:50% align:center
right, Siesta?

00:40:09.117 --> 00:40:10.744 position:50% align:center
That's because you told me
most of the Hanakos were from

00:40:10.827 --> 00:40:12.996 position:50% align:center
the track and field club.

00:40:13.079 --> 00:40:14.581 position:50% align:center
What kind of weirdo
wears running shoes

00:40:14.664 --> 00:40:16.249 position:50% align:center
with a full rabbit costume?

00:40:16.332 --> 00:40:20.420 position:50% align:center
It was a dead giveaway--
a clearly suspicious bunny.

00:40:20.503 --> 00:40:22.339 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Thinking back on it...

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:25.800 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Siesta posed as a customer,

00:40:25.884 --> 00:40:27.719 position:50% align:center
expertly utilized their slang,

00:40:27.802 --> 00:40:31.639 position:50% align:center
and covertly established contact
with the Hanako-san cartel.

00:40:34.225 --> 00:40:37.437 position:50% align:center
Remember: A genuine
first-rate detective,

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.856 position:50% align:center
one who's worth their salt,
gets a handle on the case

00:40:39.939 --> 00:40:42.025 position:50% align:center
before the incident occurs.

00:40:42.108 --> 00:40:43.568 position:50% align:center
To a detective of your caliber,

00:40:43.651 --> 00:40:47.489 position:50% align:center
this wasn't a particularly
challenging case.

00:40:47.572 --> 00:40:49.282 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
However...

00:40:49.366 --> 00:40:52.577 position:50% align:center
Recent word from the rumor mill
says that SPES also had a hand

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.788 position:50% align:center
in this whole
flower-pollen-drug debacle.

00:40:54.871 --> 00:40:57.999 position:50% align:center
That's the secret organization
you mentioned, right?

00:40:58.083 --> 00:41:00.835 position:50% align:center
From hijacking planes to
using schools' urban legends

00:41:00.919 --> 00:41:02.879 position:50% align:center
as cover for
criminal activity...

00:41:02.962 --> 00:41:06.049 position:50% align:center
What do you think
they're trying to accomplish?

00:41:06.132 --> 00:41:09.928 position:50% align:center
It's rather simple.
"SPES" means "hope" in Latin.

00:41:10.011 --> 00:41:13.598 position:50% align:center
Their main purpose is to offer
salvation to those who seek it.

00:41:14.891 --> 00:41:18.144 position:50% align:center
Now it's starting to sound
like some shady religion.

00:41:18.228 --> 00:41:19.771 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
So...

00:41:19.854 --> 00:41:22.482 position:50% align:center
What're you going
to do moving forward?

00:41:22.565 --> 00:41:24.025 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA sighs]

00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:28.446 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Me, the guy who
said he wanted a normal life

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:33.034 position:50% align:center
where nothing ever happens,
still hadn't begun to realize.

00:41:33.118 --> 00:41:36.246 position:50% align:center
That tranquil life I was
looking for didn't exist.

00:41:36.329 --> 00:41:38.915 position:50% align:center
It had already been
poisoned at the source.

00:41:42.419 --> 00:41:43.336 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Siesta.

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:44.421 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:41:46.923 --> 00:41:48.758 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna ask you this
one more time:

00:41:48.842 --> 00:41:50.719 position:50% align:center
What kind of advantages
would I gain by working with you

00:41:50.802 --> 00:41:52.762 position:50% align:center
as your sidekick?

00:41:52.846 --> 00:41:55.807 position:50% align:center
I need to know what benefits
you're going to offer.

00:41:57.892 --> 00:41:59.310 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] I mean,
why would anyone want me

00:41:59.394 --> 00:42:01.521 position:50% align:center
as their sidekick, anyway?

00:42:01.604 --> 00:42:05.316 position:50% align:center
The reason must be that I'm
a born trouble-magnet, right?

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:09.446 position:50% align:center
For Siesta, pursuing the
secretive organization SPES--

00:42:09.529 --> 00:42:12.365 position:50% align:center
that alone would
make me a valuable resource.

00:42:12.449 --> 00:42:15.493 position:50% align:center
I doubt that she's even
looking for a sidekick,

00:42:15.577 --> 00:42:18.371 position:50% align:center
but rather for the incidents
that I'll attract.

00:42:18.455 --> 00:42:21.791 position:50% align:center
That's why the only
incentives she could offer

00:42:21.875 --> 00:42:25.628 position:50% align:center
were half-assed things that
she'd improvised on the spot.

00:42:25.712 --> 00:42:27.422 position:50% align:center
I've made my decision.

00:42:27.505 --> 00:42:31.426 position:50% align:center
No matter what Siesta
may say, I'll refuse.

00:42:31.509 --> 00:42:33.303 position:50% align:center
That's the only option.

00:42:34.929 --> 00:42:36.473 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
I'll protect you, I promise.

00:42:36.556 --> 00:42:38.058 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:42:38.141 --> 00:42:40.310 position:50% align:center
Whatever kinds of troubles or
incidents your unlucky nature

00:42:40.393 --> 00:42:43.355 position:50% align:center
ends up dragging you into,
I give you my word--

00:42:43.438 --> 00:42:46.191 position:50% align:center
I'll put my life on
the line to keep you safe.

00:42:46.274 --> 00:42:48.568 position:50% align:center
So please...

00:42:48.651 --> 00:42:51.654 position:50% align:center
Kimi, I truly hope you'll
become my sidekick.

00:42:51.738 --> 00:42:53.198 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA gasps]

00:42:56.493 --> 00:43:00.288 position:50% align:center
You're trying a clever new way
of twisting things around.

00:43:00.372 --> 00:43:02.290 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] A blunt request
glossing over the reality

00:43:02.374 --> 00:43:04.250 position:50% align:center
of the situation.

00:43:11.549 --> 00:43:13.802 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Well...

00:43:13.885 --> 00:43:15.345 position:50% align:center
If you're willing
to meet me this far,

00:43:15.428 --> 00:43:17.347 position:50% align:center
I'll go along with you.

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:20.934 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA chuckles]
I thought as much.

00:43:24.938 --> 00:43:27.023 position:50% align:center
In coming all the way here,
you'd kind of already

00:43:27.107 --> 00:43:28.775 position:50% align:center
given me your answer.

00:43:30.443 --> 00:43:32.862 position:50% align:center
Either way, when you toss out
the word "sidekick,"

00:43:32.946 --> 00:43:35.573 position:50% align:center
I'm still not certain
what you're looking for.

00:43:35.657 --> 00:43:37.325 position:50% align:center
The day would start
with you waking me up,

00:43:37.409 --> 00:43:39.536 position:50% align:center
readying my toothbrush,
and lending me a hand

00:43:39.619 --> 00:43:41.454 position:50% align:center
with getting dressed.

00:43:43.248 --> 00:43:45.291 position:50% align:center
I'm not interested at all.

00:43:46.459 --> 00:43:48.169 position:50% align:center
You thought about
it before replying,

00:43:48.253 --> 00:43:49.587 position:50% align:center
which meant you thought it
sounded good enough

00:43:49.671 --> 00:43:51.631 position:50% align:center
to not reject outright.

00:43:51.715 --> 00:43:53.466 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA growls]
Fine! I get it.

00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:54.968 position:50% align:center
You win, okay?!

00:43:55.051 --> 00:43:57.303 position:50% align:center
I'll become your sidekick
if you're gonna be so insistent!

00:43:57.387 --> 00:44:00.015 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:44:00.098 --> 00:44:03.518 position:50% align:center
For better or worse,
as long as we both shall live!

00:44:03.601 --> 00:44:05.895 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Ah...

00:44:05.979 --> 00:44:07.355 position:50% align:center
Are you proposing to me--

00:44:07.439 --> 00:44:09.649 position:50% align:center
N-No, not like that!

00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:14.529 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] This is how my
dizzying tale of adventure

00:44:14.612 --> 00:44:18.199 position:50% align:center
with Siesta,
Ace Detective, truly began.

00:44:21.703 --> 00:44:24.039 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
At least...

00:44:24.122 --> 00:44:26.750 position:50% align:center
...until death did us part.

00:44:29.961 --> 00:44:31.671 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
That's right...

00:44:31.755 --> 00:44:35.633 position:50% align:center
The detective...
is already dead.

00:46:27.579 --> 00:46:28.913 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 1D]
Hmm.
