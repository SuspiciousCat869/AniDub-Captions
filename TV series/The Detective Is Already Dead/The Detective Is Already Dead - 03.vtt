[SAIKAWA]
Hello, I, uh...

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:14.514 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm actually an idol.

00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:15.724 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA gasps]

00:00:15.807 --> 00:00:17.684 position:50% align:center
Um. Listen, you gotta help me--

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:20.770 position:50% align:center
it's a job for
a legendary detective!

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:21.896 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA sighs]

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.150 position:50% align:center
Wrong person, kid.
I'm not a detective.

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:26.443 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI grunts]

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:29.946 position:50% align:center
Huh? But I...

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.698 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
I'm sorry.

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:36.202 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, this unmotivated
slacker's just a sidekick.

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:38.163 position:50% align:center
But it's okay.

00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:40.290 position:50% align:center
If it's a detective
you're looking for,

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:44.711 position:50% align:center
then there's one right here.
Nagisa Natsunagi.

00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:46.838 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] The detective
is already dead,

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:49.257 position:50% align:center
but her dying wish...

00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:51.468 position:50% align:center
will never truly die.

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:25.854 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA] So, yeah.
My name is Yui Saikawa.

00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:27.188 position:50% align:center
I work as an idol.

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:28.565 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you.

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:29.816 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:33.153 position:50% align:center
Right. Okay... Um...

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:35.113 position:50% align:center
This might sound crazy,
but I need your help to prevent

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:37.657 position:50% align:center
the theft of a sapphire
worth three billion yen!

00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:39.617 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Uh? U-Uh...

00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:40.994 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA]
Around a month ago...

00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:43.621 position:50% align:center
I got a note warning
me about the crime!

00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:45.790 position:50% align:center
We went ahead and upped
our vault's safety measures,

00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:48.710 position:50% align:center
but on the appointed day, my
security will be at my concert--

00:02:48.793 --> 00:02:51.421 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] That's cool, but
can you shut up for a second?

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:52.672 position:50% align:center
[muffled grunting]

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:55.508 position:50% align:center
Maybe a little
less shouting, huh?

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:56.509 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
This week's...

00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:58.053 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI, MATSURI]
...idol news!

00:02:58.136 --> 00:02:59.971 position:50% align:center
Today, we're checking out
the middle-school idol

00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:01.681 position:50% align:center
who can sing and dance.

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:03.975 position:50% align:center
She's reigning supreme
at the top of the charts.

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:06.436 position:50% align:center
Let's give it up
for Yui Saikawa!

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.063 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
So cute!

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:10.857 position:50% align:center
This idol exploded after
her debut as a sixth-grader

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.901 position:50% align:center
due to her unique songs
and dance style.

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:15.070 position:50% align:center
Her adorable expressions
and outgoing personality

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:16.946 position:50% align:center
have made her super popular.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.282 position:50% align:center
If you're a fan of
Yui Saikawa like I am,

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:21.785 position:50% align:center
then get ready, 'cause her
live is coming up!

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:23.578 position:50% align:center
--Huh?!
--So hype!

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:25.872 position:50% align:center
--It's next week, right?!
--You got it!

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:27.540 position:50% align:center
Hooray!

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:29.000 position:50% align:center
That's you.
You weren't lying.

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:31.336 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA grunting]

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.046 position:50% align:center
Ow, hey! Jeez!

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.048 position:50% align:center
Hey! Come back here!

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:37.217 position:50% align:center
How dare you put
your gross hands on me!

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.720 position:50% align:center
Ugh! Do you have any idea whose
mouth you just covered?!

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:45.016 position:50% align:center
I'm the world's cutest idol.
The Yui Saikawa!

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.727 position:50% align:center
So, you keep those
grungy hands off me, mister!

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:49.396 position:50% align:center
Calm down, Saikawa.

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.773 position:50% align:center
I mean, sure, maybe I do
have the cutest idol's

00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:53.983 position:50% align:center
saliva smeared all
over both my hands,

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:56.403 position:50% align:center
but it's not like I'm gonna put
it in a vial and auction it off

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:57.946 position:50% align:center
online or anything.

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:01.449 position:50% align:center
Ew, disgusting! You're not a
detective--you're a giant perv!

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:03.618 position:50% align:center
Hold on, you're not like,
secretly the sapphire thief

00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:05.453 position:50% align:center
who sent me the
warning, are you?!

00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:08.331 position:50% align:center
Whoa, help me!
Somebody please call the police!

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.250 position:50% align:center
Quickly, before he gets away!

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.961 position:50% align:center
Heh. Yeah, I'm sorry to
burst your cute little bubble,

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:15.213 position:50% align:center
but the police and I
are actually pretty tight.

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:16.715 position:50% align:center
Wait, seriously?

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:18.675 position:50% align:center
Are you saying this whole
nation is hopelessly corrupt,

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.218 position:50% align:center
from top to bottom?

00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:22.595 position:50% align:center
The police, the lawyers, the
politicians, and everyone else

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:24.514 position:50% align:center
are all on the side
of a panty thief?

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:26.016 position:50% align:center
Wait, back that truck up.

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.351 position:50% align:center
I don't know how you made
the leap from pervert to thief,

00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:29.853 position:50% align:center
but I'm gonna need
you to come back to Earth

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.396 position:50% align:center
with the rest of us.

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.440 position:50% align:center
And for the record, I'm not
a thief or a perv, thank you.

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:36.651 position:50% align:center
Right, just a guy who steals
spit and threatens to sell it.

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:40.071 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA sighs] It was a joke.
I'm not a bad guy.

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:42.615 position:50% align:center
Good guys don't
really have to say that.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.910 position:50% align:center
I apologize for my sidekick--
it's been kind of crazy day.

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:48.455 position:50% align:center
Could we possibly discuss
your case tomorrow?

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:51.207 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA]
Uh... No problem.

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:52.625 position:50% align:center
If you think it would
be better that way,

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:55.086 position:50% align:center
then I can definitely
make it work, Miss Detective.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.006 position:50% align:center
Later, guys!
See you tomorrow!

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:01.468 position:50% align:center
--[KIMIZUKA sighs]
--[NATSUNAGI chuckles]

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:04.346 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA sighs]
So, you're doing this, then?

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:06.014 position:50% align:center
Detective work?

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:09.476 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI] Mm. My body kind
of just moved on its own

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:11.978 position:50% align:center
before I even knew
what was happening.

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:13.521 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA sighs]

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:15.398 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] It's all I can do
to try and keep my cool

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:17.359 position:50% align:center
in Natsunagi's presence.

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:20.445 position:50% align:center
I keep thinking about
my former partner who died.

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:22.947 position:50% align:center
Only to find out
her heart is still beating.

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:26.868 position:50% align:center
Even if it isn't in the
same body, it's a real shock.

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:31.289 position:50% align:center
That fact alone has maxed out
my brain's capacity for the day.

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:34.084 position:50% align:center
I just don't have the headspace
to think about anything else.

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:36.670 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA chuckles]

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:38.213 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Though,
if there's one thing I know

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:40.882 position:50% align:center
about the detective, it's that
she would have laughed at me

00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:43.593 position:50% align:center
for being so sentimental.

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:45.929 position:50% align:center
She could've at least
said goodbye.

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:50.475 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Or... Maybe
that's why she came back?

00:05:50.558 --> 00:05:52.936 position:50% align:center
To say her goodbyes.
Who knows?

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.397 position:50% align:center
--[NATSUNAGI] Kimizuka.
--Uh?

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.607 position:50% align:center
I... wanna say...

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:02.278 position:50% align:center
I look forward to
working with you. Thanks.

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:04.906 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Yeah. Same.

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:06.991 position:50% align:center
Right. I'm gonna
head back home now.

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:09.744 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Uh. I'll see you tomorrow?

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:16.334 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI] Once I became
aware of it, I felt like

00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:19.212 position:50% align:center
I'd been searching for
someone for a long time,

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:22.549 position:50% align:center
even though, really,
it's just been a year or so.

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:25.468 position:50% align:center
And I guess...
this new "identity" of mine

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:27.804 position:50% align:center
established itself
recently, too.

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:30.348 position:50% align:center
'Least, I only
noticed it recently.

00:06:30.432 --> 00:06:32.976 position:50% align:center
I've been sick
ever since I was a kid.

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:35.854 position:50% align:center
Spent my whole childhood in bed.

00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:39.607 position:50% align:center
I wanted to put on running
shoes and sprint around a track.

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:43.236 position:50% align:center
I wanted to meet up with friends
and goof off after school.

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:47.824 position:50% align:center
But for me, these things
were just out of reach.

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:52.412 position:50% align:center
When I realized that,
I gave up on those dreams.

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:56.708 position:50% align:center
And without dreams, you don't
have much of an identity.

00:06:56.791 --> 00:07:01.171 position:50% align:center
So yeah, I was
a shell of a person.

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:04.049 position:50% align:center
Till the day I woke up
with a new heart.

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:07.218 position:50% align:center
A heart that had the strength
to want something.

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:08.845 position:50% align:center
It was crying out.

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:11.264 position:50% align:center
Telling me that there was
someone it needed to see.

00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:12.474 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI panting]

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:14.517 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Before I knew it, I was running.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.523 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
You're the legendary detective.

00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:25.695 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI] The source of hope
I'd finally found was lifeless.

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:27.739 position:50% align:center
His spirit was broken.

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:30.325 position:50% align:center
He was as empty
as I'd ever been.

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:33.286 position:50% align:center
Something about him
reminded me of myself.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.372 position:50% align:center
Of the person I used to be.

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.832 position:50% align:center
I couldn't just leave him.

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:41.419 position:50% align:center
Instead... I completely lost it.

00:07:41.503 --> 00:07:44.255 position:50% align:center
I even let the idiot see me cry.

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:46.299 position:50% align:center
No matter who that heart
used to belong to,

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:47.842 position:50% align:center
you should live
your own life now,

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:49.552 position:50% align:center
because that's
what it's for, okay?

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:51.096 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:57.185 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI] Those words
meant everything to me.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.356 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI] That's why...
I'm going to embrace it.

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:04.275 position:50% align:center
My fresh start and this
brand-new life of mine.

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:07.278 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA]
Um, ahem.

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:10.824 position:50% align:center
I apologize for my behavior.
Yesterday, I mean.

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:12.992 position:50% align:center
--[KIMIZUKA] Mm.
--Uh...

00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:15.537 position:50% align:center
I appreciate that, but...

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.956 position:50% align:center
What's with this dumb table?!
You're so far away,

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:19.916 position:50% align:center
you're practically in
a different time zone!

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.668 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA]
What?! Don't be silly!

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:23.712 position:50% align:center
It's a perfectly
normal-sized table!

00:08:23.795 --> 00:08:25.714 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] If you really believe
that, then why do we have to

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:27.590 position:50% align:center
shout back and forth like this?

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:30.427 position:50% align:center
Oh, that? Well, if we spoke
normally, then we obviously

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.887 position:50% align:center
wouldn't be able to hear
each other, you big dumb!

00:08:32.971 --> 00:08:36.474 position:50% align:center
That only reinforces my point
that we're too far away.

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:40.895 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA]
There. Now we can finally focus.

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:43.148 position:50% align:center
By the way, what's
with the eye patch?

00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:44.149 position:50% align:center
Is your eye hurt?

00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:45.483 position:50% align:center
Oh. Not really.

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:47.861 position:50% align:center
To be honest,
it's just part of my persona.

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:50.739 position:50% align:center
Gotta stand out from
the other idols, you know?

00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:52.615 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I'm sorry
to ask you guys for help

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:54.451 position:50% align:center
on such short notice.

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:57.287 position:50% align:center
I don't mean to be dramatic,
but time is of the essence.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.080 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
It's fine.

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:01.624 position:50% align:center
There's nothing to worry about
now that I'm on the case.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:03.835 position:50% align:center
After all, I'm an ace detective!

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:06.963 position:50% align:center
She says, having never
solved a single case.

00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:08.381 position:50% align:center
All right then, Saikawa.

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:10.633 position:50% align:center
Can you please give us
details of your story?

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:13.595 position:50% align:center
Yes. It happened the other day.

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:16.765 position:50% align:center
This arrived unexpectedly.

00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:18.266 position:50% align:center
A letter?

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.020 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI] "On the day of Yui
Saikawa's live performance

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:24.647 position:50% align:center
at the Dome, we will take
possession of the sapphire

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:26.483 position:50% align:center
valued at three billion yen."

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:27.859 position:50% align:center
Nice of them to warn you.

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:29.527 position:50% align:center
Though I gotta say that
the whole cut and paste

00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:31.696 position:50% align:center
lettering thing seems
a bit on the tropey side.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.157 position:50% align:center
I need you guys to help me
prevent the theft.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.950 position:50% align:center
That's a tall order.

00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:38.203 position:50% align:center
And do you happen to know what
sapphire they're referring to

00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:39.496 position:50% align:center
in the letter?

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:41.498 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA]
Yes. It's only a guess,

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:43.083 position:50% align:center
but I think it's our
family heirloom,

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:44.793 position:50% align:center
the "Miracle Sapphire."

00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:46.294 position:50% align:center
Didn't the letter tell you
the date they're planning

00:09:46.378 --> 00:09:47.796 position:50% align:center
the crime, though?

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:50.131 position:50% align:center
I mean, you could probably
just add some extra security.

00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:51.508 position:50% align:center
Not to be rude...

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:53.510 position:50% align:center
...but seems like
you've got a bunch.

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:55.762 position:50% align:center
Well, I don't think
that's gonna be possible.

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:58.723 position:50% align:center
All my security will be at the
venue during my performance.

00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:01.810 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Mm. Oh, I get it, you
mean like they're gonna be busy

00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:04.604 position:50% align:center
doing the security detail
at your concert instead.

00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:07.941 position:50% align:center
Uh, no. These guys are
actually my biggest fans.

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:10.568 position:50% align:center
Guarding a gigantic rock
doesn't matter to them at all.

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:12.404 position:50% align:center
The only thing they really
care about is watching

00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:14.489 position:50% align:center
my big song-and-dance number.

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:17.117 position:50% align:center
How dare you guys
call yourself security!

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.286 position:50% align:center
Sorry. But if you're just gonna
mess with us, then I'm leaving.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.372 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Wait, Kimizuka.

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:25.291 position:50% align:center
This girl came to us because she
needed our help specifically.

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:27.335 position:50% align:center
The least we can
do is hear her out.

00:10:27.419 --> 00:10:30.714 position:50% align:center
Wow, for real? I didn't realize
you were so into this.

00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:32.048 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Come on...

00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:34.300 position:50% align:center
A job from a girl that lives
in a small mansion?

00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:35.760 position:50% align:center
Cha-ching!

00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:38.054 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] I get what
you're saying, but this isn't

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:40.348 position:50% align:center
the kind of work you do
just for the money, you know?

00:10:40.432 --> 00:10:43.643 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI] No, but I'd say
it's a nice benefit!

00:10:43.727 --> 00:10:45.020 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
She's got a point.

00:10:45.103 --> 00:10:47.063 position:50% align:center
After spending three
years on the run,

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:48.857 position:50% align:center
always on the
brink of poverty...

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.817 position:50% align:center
Well, I probably understand
the importance of money

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.318 position:50% align:center
better than anybody.

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:53.987 position:50% align:center
Maybe she's preparing for that.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.405 position:50% align:center
I want a new swimsuit.

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:56.781 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Nope.

00:10:56.865 --> 00:10:59.325 position:50% align:center
Fine, it's whatever, even if
we have different ideas,

00:10:59.409 --> 00:11:01.619 position:50% align:center
you're right in that
money still matters.

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:03.121 position:50% align:center
So, is that it?
On the day of the show,

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:05.415 position:50% align:center
you just need Natsunagi and I
to stay behind and guard

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:07.375 position:50% align:center
your home vault in lieu
of your security?

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:09.836 position:50% align:center
That's right,
nothing complicated.

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:12.213 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] If that's the case,
wouldn't it be better to let

00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:13.757 position:50% align:center
the police handle it?

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.301 position:50% align:center
Actually, I already tried
discussing it with them,

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:18.219 position:50% align:center
but with only the letter
as proof, they pretty much

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:19.387 position:50% align:center
just wrote me off.

00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:20.805 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA grunts]

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.516 position:50% align:center
What's with the face?!

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.893 position:50% align:center
You're wondering why I didn't
throw some money at them

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:26.394 position:50% align:center
to make them listen, aren't you?

00:11:26.478 --> 00:11:28.813 position:50% align:center
Only a pervert would
think such terrible things.

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:31.441 position:50% align:center
How exactly would that
make me a pervert?!

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:32.859 position:50% align:center
But you're right.

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:34.903 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA]
Of course. The way I see it is,

00:11:34.986 --> 00:11:36.821 position:50% align:center
if you can't find any bread,
then the next step

00:11:36.905 --> 00:11:39.532 position:50% align:center
is to just purchase a bakery.

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:41.534 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I bet even Marie
Antoinette would be shocked

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:43.495 position:50% align:center
by that way of thinking.

00:11:43.578 --> 00:11:44.996 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA]
Will you help?

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.832 position:50% align:center
First, why are you the one
that's organizing all of this?

00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:50.460 position:50% align:center
It doesn't make sense.
You're still just a kid.

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:53.463 position:50% align:center
If a Saikawa family heirloom
is being targeted for theft.

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:56.758 position:50% align:center
Why aren't your
parents handling it?

00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:59.803 position:50% align:center
To be honest, my parents
both died three years ago.

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:03.807 position:50% align:center
So, the head of
the Saikawa household...

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.142 position:50% align:center
...would be little ol' me!

00:12:06.685 --> 00:12:08.478 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA]
Here she is!

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:12.107 position:50% align:center
It's our family's heirloom--
the Miracle Sapphire.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.901 position:50% align:center
It's huge. Doesn't really seem
like your style, though.

00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:16.277 position:50% align:center
It's beautiful!

00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:17.737 position:50% align:center
Truly.

00:12:17.821 --> 00:12:19.906 position:50% align:center
Thank you. You can see why
we have an airtight

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:21.908 position:50% align:center
security system in place.

00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:22.909 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Uh.

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:26.204 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI whimpering]

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:27.997 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Will you just
go to the restroom already?

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:30.417 position:50% align:center
Ah? How could you tell
I needed to go?

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.336 position:50% align:center
You have exceptional observation
skills, Mister Pervert.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.171 position:50% align:center
A normal guy could
never tell such a thing.

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:37.882 position:50% align:center
It's just a skill I learned
from an old friend.

00:12:37.966 --> 00:12:40.885 position:50% align:center
I may have drank too much tea.
I'll be right back!

00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:44.431 position:50% align:center
I swear...

00:12:46.725 --> 00:12:48.393 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Hmm...

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:50.603 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:51.938 position:50% align:center
Hey, Kimizuka...

00:12:52.022 --> 00:12:53.106 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:55.442 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA giggles]
Oh, now I understand.

00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:57.902 position:50% align:center
You feel pleasure when someone
breathes softly in your ear.

00:12:57.986 --> 00:13:00.572 position:50% align:center
I never would have guessed
you were that type of pervert.

00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:03.867 position:50% align:center
Stop finding weird reasons
to make me out to be a pervert.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.286 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's up with this?

00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:08.830 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA] It's a photo
from my first live show.

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:11.166 position:50% align:center
It's a super-rare picture,
you can't even find it

00:13:11.249 --> 00:13:13.126 position:50% align:center
on the internet.

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:14.836 position:50% align:center
Just as I thought...

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:17.172 position:50% align:center
You're becoming obsessed
with me, aren't you?

00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:18.965 position:50% align:center
--Uh?
--You're a fan, huh?

00:13:19.049 --> 00:13:20.717 position:50% align:center
Are you in love with me?

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.260 position:50% align:center
It'll never work, though...

00:13:22.344 --> 00:13:25.013 position:50% align:center
I'm an idol, so falling in love
is out of the question for us.

00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:27.349 position:50% align:center
Look me up in
the next life, okay?

00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:30.435 position:50% align:center
Assuming my feelings and
rejecting me in the same breath.

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:33.104 position:50% align:center
Strange stuff.
Anyway, where's Natsunagi?

00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:35.648 position:50% align:center
You know, her beauty
is undeniable.

00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:37.067 position:50% align:center
She's definitely pretty.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.527 position:50% align:center
Though her personality
is a bit rough at times.

00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:42.405 position:50% align:center
Oh, Natsunagi is pretty,
but I meant myself.

00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:44.407 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Ah, you're the kind
of girl who praises herself

00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:46.242 position:50% align:center
--in the third person.
--Eh-heh!

00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:48.161 position:50% align:center
Well, when it comes
to the world of idols,

00:13:48.244 --> 00:13:49.996 position:50% align:center
you've gotta have a ton of
self-confidence or you'll

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.498 position:50% align:center
straight up drown.

00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:52.874 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Hmm?

00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:55.502 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA] Rival idols might
sabotage your outfits

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:58.713 position:50% align:center
or even stick tacks in your
shoes before you go onstage.

00:13:58.797 --> 00:14:01.841 position:50% align:center
Happens all the time, but
when it happens to yours truly,

00:14:01.925 --> 00:14:04.761 position:50% align:center
the perpetrators tend
to disappear the next day.

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:07.806 position:50% align:center
What a coincidence.
It is a coincidence, right?

00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:09.557 position:50% align:center
[giggles]
I like you, Kimizuka--

00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:11.267 position:50% align:center
your reactions are really funny.

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:12.977 position:50% align:center
One of those statements
was a joke.

00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:15.730 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] For my peace of mind,
which part was the joke?

00:14:15.814 --> 00:14:17.565 position:50% align:center
The part where
I said I like you.

00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:19.526 position:50% align:center
Jeez, don't tell me
you fell for it.

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:21.319 position:50% align:center
I think I get it now.

00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:23.530 position:50% align:center
You enjoy messing
with me, don't you?

00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:26.533 position:50% align:center
[giggles] No, no, no, that
last thing was the real joke.

00:14:26.616 --> 00:14:28.702 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:29.869 position:50% align:center
Yeah, to be honest with you,

00:14:29.953 --> 00:14:31.621 position:50% align:center
I can't tell when
you're putting me on,

00:14:31.705 --> 00:14:33.540 position:50% align:center
or when you're being serious.

00:14:33.623 --> 00:14:36.918 position:50% align:center
Guess that's all par for the
course in the idol world, huh?

00:14:37.002 --> 00:14:38.378 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA giggles]

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:41.631 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna pry,
but how are you handling this?

00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:43.967 position:50% align:center
Huh? I'm not sure what you mean.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.094 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Sunday is your
live stadium show, right?

00:14:46.177 --> 00:14:47.762 position:50% align:center
But with this
letter you received,

00:14:47.846 --> 00:14:52.225 position:50% align:center
I guess--How do I put this?
How's your mental headspace?

00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:54.561 position:50% align:center
I bet it's a lot
to handle alone.

00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:57.772 position:50% align:center
I'm all right.

00:14:57.856 --> 00:15:00.233 position:50% align:center
And it's not as if
I'm all by myself.

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:03.319 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Hmm...

00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:06.406 position:50% align:center
You're a really nice guy.
Thanks, Kimizuka.

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:07.741 position:50% align:center
Am, I though?

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:09.993 position:50% align:center
It's not something people
have said that often.

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:11.536 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA]
People change.

00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:13.913 position:50% align:center
Maybe that cold, unfeeling
lump in your chest is growing

00:15:13.997 --> 00:15:15.582 position:50% align:center
into a human heart.

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:17.542 position:50% align:center
You've seen too many movies
about robots who learned

00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:19.085 position:50% align:center
how to have real emotions,

00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:21.212 position:50% align:center
whereas I've always
been human, thank you.

00:15:21.296 --> 00:15:23.673 position:50% align:center
You really are funny, Kimizuka.

00:15:23.757 --> 00:15:25.925 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA sighs]

00:15:26.009 --> 00:15:28.595 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna check out the rest
of your security detail.

00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:30.347 position:50% align:center
For sure, be my guest.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.518 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] I knew it.
This gig is gonna be trouble.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.899 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
So? What you think?

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:42.150 position:50% align:center
About the case, I mean.

00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:43.526 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Well, don't get mad at me,

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.570 position:50% align:center
but it's different
than I thought.

00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:46.613 position:50% align:center
Why would I get mad?

00:15:46.696 --> 00:15:47.822 position:50% align:center
Oh, I don't know.

00:15:47.906 --> 00:15:49.824 position:50% align:center
I just didn't expect it
to be so difficult.

00:15:49.908 --> 00:15:51.493 position:50% align:center
I sort of thought it would
be more along the lines

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:54.120 position:50% align:center
of looking for lost dogs,
you know, like that movie about

00:15:54.204 --> 00:15:55.538 position:50% align:center
the pet detective?

00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:59.793 position:50% align:center
You owe every detective in
Japan an enormous apology.

00:15:59.876 --> 00:16:01.670 position:50% align:center
--Um--
--[NATSUNAGI] Yesterday...

00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:06.633 position:50% align:center
...I had a weird dream...
about Siesta.

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:10.762 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Really. Did she
seem to be doing all right

00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:12.097 position:50% align:center
in this dream?

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.224 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess. You didn't
tell me she was pretty.

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:15.642 position:50% align:center
--She is.
--Ya know,

00:16:15.725 --> 00:16:17.394 position:50% align:center
it's kind of stupid for to you
say that like her beauty

00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:19.312 position:50% align:center
is somehow your
accomplishment.

00:16:19.396 --> 00:16:21.147 position:50% align:center
You girls talk about
anything cool?

00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:23.400 position:50% align:center
Uh. Well, it was more
like an argument.

00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:25.276 position:50% align:center
Jeez, it must have been
one heck of a dream meeting

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.945 position:50% align:center
if it went south that quickly.

00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:29.656 position:50% align:center
Then again, I can't say
I'm surprised, either.

00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:33.243 position:50% align:center
We had a real vicious argument,
just a barrage of shouting.

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:35.787 position:50% align:center
But, in the end, she asked me
to take care of you,

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.414 position:50% align:center
so that's that.

00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:39.624 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:43.128 position:50% align:center
I was the cause of the fight?
Wow, I'm flattered.

00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:45.505 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI grunts]
No, hold on a second!

00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:48.216 position:50% align:center
It's not like we were fighting
over you directly or anything!

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:50.135 position:50% align:center
Huh? Why do you
look so flustered?

00:16:50.218 --> 00:16:51.803 position:50% align:center
Okay, now I'm worried for real.

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:54.347 position:50% align:center
Ugh, shut up! I'm done
talking about this!

00:16:54.431 --> 00:16:56.683 position:50% align:center
Listen. The point is, she said
that we should do our best

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:58.768 position:50% align:center
to work together,
with me as the detective,

00:16:58.852 --> 00:17:00.228 position:50% align:center
and you as the assistant!

00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:02.939 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure. A new
swimsuit's at stake, right?

00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:06.067 position:50% align:center
You'd be lucky to see it.
You do wanna see, right?

00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:08.945 position:50% align:center
Yeah, totally. I'll die
if I don't see it.

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:12.032 position:50% align:center
I don't love the sarcasm.
But I guess I'll deal with it.

00:17:12.115 --> 00:17:13.616 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Thanks a lot.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.244 position:50% align:center
So, once we've safely resolved
the case and everything,

00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:18.079 position:50% align:center
wanna go to the beach with me?

00:17:18.163 --> 00:17:20.248 position:50% align:center
That's the crap you say
right before you get killed.

00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:22.500 position:50% align:center
I'm not going to die.

00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:27.380 position:50% align:center
I promise that I won't.

00:17:27.464 --> 00:17:30.008 position:50% align:center
Why would I ever choose
to die and leave you all alone?

00:17:30.091 --> 00:17:31.593 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.389 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't do that to you.

00:17:36.473 --> 00:17:38.224 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA gasps]

00:17:38.308 --> 00:17:39.684 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:17:44.272 --> 00:17:45.690 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Hurry up, Natsunagi!

00:17:45.774 --> 00:17:47.108 position:50% align:center
The rehearsal is about to start.

00:17:47.192 --> 00:17:48.568 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI panting]

00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:51.112 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid to ask,
but what's with that get up?

00:17:51.196 --> 00:17:53.031 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Huh? Get up?

00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:54.324 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:17:58.078 --> 00:18:00.622 position:50% align:center
Hold on, is this why
you've been MIA all week?

00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:02.290 position:50% align:center
I mean, you've been
absent from school,

00:18:02.374 --> 00:18:04.834 position:50% align:center
and you haven't responded to
any of the messages I sent you.

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:06.920 position:50% align:center
And when I finally did get a
reply, it said we were going

00:18:07.003 --> 00:18:08.713 position:50% align:center
to rehearsal the day
before the show.

00:18:08.797 --> 00:18:11.341 position:50% align:center
Sorry, it's just I ended up
binge-watching Yui-nya's

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:13.718 position:50% align:center
past TV appearances,
and before I knew what happened,

00:18:13.802 --> 00:18:15.053 position:50% align:center
it was already today.

00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:16.471 position:50% align:center
Yui-nya?

00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:19.057 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's what
her fans call her.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.183 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Ugh...

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:21.893 position:50% align:center
Okay...

00:18:21.976 --> 00:18:23.645 position:50% align:center
...I'm gonna put you
out of your misery.

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:25.480 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Uncle!

00:18:25.563 --> 00:18:28.191 position:50% align:center
You do understand
what tomorrow is, right?

00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:30.527 position:50% align:center
Of course--
it's Yui-nya's live show.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.362 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Yes, I suppose it is.

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:35.115 position:50% align:center
But that's not what
concerns us, is it, now?

00:18:35.198 --> 00:18:36.741 position:50% align:center
Our job is to protect
the Miracle Sapphire

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:38.451 position:50% align:center
from a burglar, yeah?

00:18:38.535 --> 00:18:40.412 position:50% align:center
I understand what
you're saying, Natsunagi,

00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:42.622 position:50% align:center
but I'd argue familiarizing
yourself with the client's

00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:45.083 position:50% align:center
background is equally
as important.

00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:47.377 position:50% align:center
Fair point, but I still think
that begging Saikawa

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.212 position:50% align:center
to let you watch her rehearsal
might be taking things

00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:51.172 position:50% align:center
a little too far, you know?

00:18:51.256 --> 00:18:53.967 position:50% align:center
Once you accept a job, you can't
be afraid to go all in.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.844 position:50% align:center
And tomorrow, we're
both gonna be super busy

00:18:55.927 --> 00:18:57.262 position:50% align:center
watching Yui-nya's house.

00:18:57.345 --> 00:18:59.514 position:50% align:center
So, we might as well
have a little fun today.

00:18:59.597 --> 00:19:01.516 position:50% align:center
Ah, so today's about fun.

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:03.560 position:50% align:center
I'd bet you good money that her
opening number is gonna be

00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:05.186 position:50% align:center
"Raspberry Grizzly."

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:06.938 position:50% align:center
I refuse that bet I because
I don't know anything

00:19:07.022 --> 00:19:08.106 position:50% align:center
about her music.

00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:10.233 position:50% align:center
Come on, we're gonna
miss the rehearsal!

[NATSUNAGI]
Is this dude for real?

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.135 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA]
Thank you so much!

00:19:37.218 --> 00:19:39.804 position:50% align:center
That song was "Sudden Stop
on the Nine-Star Express"

00:19:39.888 --> 00:19:42.057 position:50% align:center
from my second album, how fun!

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.183 position:50% align:center
So, it does stop?

00:19:43.266 --> 00:19:45.602 position:50% align:center
Don't sweat the lyrics too much.

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:47.979 position:50% align:center
Now for my next song!
You ready?

00:19:48.063 --> 00:19:49.939 position:50% align:center
--Here goes.
--What now?

00:19:50.023 --> 00:19:52.859 position:50% align:center
Come on, Natsunagi.
"Eighty-One" was the last song.

00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:54.694 position:50% align:center
So, you gotta know
what the next one is.

00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:56.780 position:50% align:center
I said I don't know
anything about her set list.

00:19:56.863 --> 00:19:58.281 position:50% align:center
And what's more,

00:19:58.365 --> 00:19:59.741 position:50% align:center
don't abbreviate "Sudden stop
on the Nine-star Express"

00:19:59.824 --> 00:20:01.034 position:50% align:center
to "Eighty-One!"

00:20:01.117 --> 00:20:04.287 position:50% align:center
9 x 9 =  81.
Geeky, but I get it.

00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:05.997 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Oh, nice
work, Detective.

00:20:06.081 --> 00:20:08.041 position:50% align:center
Next up is Yui-nya's
show-stopper.

00:20:08.124 --> 00:20:10.877 position:50% align:center
This number is the whole reason
why we came to watch today.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.921 position:50% align:center
Oh, really?
Because it's news to me.

00:20:13.004 --> 00:20:14.089 position:50% align:center
This one's special.

00:20:14.172 --> 00:20:15.965 position:50% align:center
This song's big hook
reveals what Yui-nya

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:17.342 position:50% align:center
has sealed up inside.

00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:19.010 position:50% align:center
Ya lost me.

00:20:19.094 --> 00:20:23.139 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Beneath that seal
is Yui Saikawa's secret.

Sing along if
you know the words!

00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:27.894 position:50% align:center
This one's called
"Sapphire Phantasm"!

[KIMIZUKA]
Ah, that was great.

00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:36.027 position:50% align:center
I agree, Saikawa's a real pro.

00:20:39.489 --> 00:20:42.075 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI] Hey, Kimizuka,
does that guy seem suspicious?

00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:44.327 position:50% align:center

say something?

00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:52.210 position:50% align:center
Quick, grab him!

00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:54.421 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA whimpering]

00:20:54.504 --> 00:20:56.089 position:50% align:center
Just as I suspected...

00:20:56.172 --> 00:20:57.215 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Kimizuka!

00:20:57.298 --> 00:20:58.550 position:50% align:center
Hurry!

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:01.011 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Hmm...

00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:03.722 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] As a person,
she's lovely to behold.

00:21:03.805 --> 00:21:07.726 position:50% align:center
But for a detective,
she's a little too emotional.

00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:10.145 position:50% align:center
That kindness and compassion.

00:21:10.228 --> 00:21:13.023 position:50% align:center
Those things can sometimes
come back to bite you.

00:21:14.524 --> 00:21:18.069 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Unfortunately,
Natsunagi doesn't know that yet.

00:21:21.948 --> 00:21:23.783 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
You okay?

00:21:23.867 --> 00:21:25.368 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA]
Mister Pervert!

00:21:25.452 --> 00:21:26.786 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you'd
really call me that

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:28.872 position:50% align:center
after getting attacked.

00:21:28.955 --> 00:21:31.666 position:50% align:center
But if you can joke,
that's a good sign.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.711 position:50% align:center
That said, this might
change things up a little.

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:37.422 position:50% align:center
Security for the vault
tomorrow still matters.

00:21:37.505 --> 00:21:38.631 position:50% align:center
But I think it's
worth tightening up

00:21:38.715 --> 00:21:41.259 position:50% align:center
the stadium's security, too.

00:21:41.343 --> 00:21:43.887 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna need you
to show me around later.

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:45.263 position:50% align:center
'Kay...

00:21:48.808 --> 00:21:50.226 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Every move
a detective makes

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:54.939 position:50% align:center
is based on logic. Every single
step is carefully planned.

00:21:55.023 --> 00:21:56.858 position:50% align:center
Can you stand?

00:21:56.941 --> 00:21:57.901 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:21:57.984 --> 00:21:59.986 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.571 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
However...

00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:05.241 position:50% align:center
...those steps can also reveal
that something doesn't add up.

00:22:05.325 --> 00:22:07.702 position:50% align:center
That's when you
discover new truths.

00:22:07.786 --> 00:22:10.163 position:50% align:center
And it's how I knew...

00:22:10.246 --> 00:22:12.665 position:50% align:center
--...Yui Saikawa...
--[giggles]

00:22:12.749 --> 00:22:14.417 position:50% align:center
...was a liar.
