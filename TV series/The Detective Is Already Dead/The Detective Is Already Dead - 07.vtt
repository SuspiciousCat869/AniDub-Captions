All right, and here we go!

Huh?

--[grunts]
--[ALICIA] Don't slouch!

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:23.106 position:50% align:center
Straighten up and look the part!

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.400 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I don't have
my detective cosplay!

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:26.818 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:29.279 position:50% align:center
Just look at you--you're
basically dressed for Halloween!

00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:31.698 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Hmm...?

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.243 position:50% align:center
Do you consider that
"looking the part?"

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:37.871 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA] These are
hand-me-downs from Siesta.

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:41.041 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course,
makes perfect sense.

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:43.335 position:50% align:center
Anyway, you really
wanna do a good job

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:44.669 position:50% align:center
as a substitute detective?

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:46.838 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah!

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:48.173 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
In her new role,

00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:50.258 position:50% align:center
complemented by
a ridiculous outfit,

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:53.011 position:50% align:center
Alicia took up the search
for the "Eye of Sapphire."

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:55.638 position:50% align:center
The two of us were tasked
with getting the lay of the land

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:57.098 position:50% align:center
and a feel on things.

00:00:57.182 --> 00:00:58.475 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:01.353 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA] We shouldn't
waste time! Let's get going!

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:02.979 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Huh?

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.314 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:06.399 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA panting]

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:07.609 position:50% align:center
Come back here!

00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:09.778 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA giggling]

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:12.364 position:50% align:center
Wait, Alicia!

00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:15.325 position:50% align:center
Running is the funnest
thing in the world!

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:17.702 position:50% align:center
Seeing you frolicking in the
sun like a careless little girl

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:19.287 position:50% align:center
is pretty adorable.

00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:22.791 position:50% align:center
But have sympathy for the sap
who has to chase you around!

00:02:57.093 --> 00:03:01.556 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA panting]

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.183 position:50% align:center
Alicia, you have to listen.

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:04.434 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Huh?

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:05.977 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Being curious
about everything you see

00:03:06.061 --> 00:03:08.480 position:50% align:center
is really cool and all, but
let's not forget we still have

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:10.899 position:50% align:center
no idea as to
who you really are.

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:13.860 position:50% align:center
You're gonna have to
listen to me more closely.

00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:16.946 position:50% align:center
Running around by
yourself is not allowed.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.700 position:50% align:center
Okay, fine, but I don't like it
when you treat me like a baby.

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:22.994 position:50% align:center
Fair enough. We're set, then.

00:03:23.078 --> 00:03:24.829 position:50% align:center
Now, let's go.

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:26.164 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Hmm.

00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:28.875 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute...

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.502 position:50% align:center
Why do you have
to hold my hand?!

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:32.003 position:50% align:center
For real, you gotta
quit treating me like

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:33.922 position:50% align:center
I'm a little kid!

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:35.382 position:50% align:center
I don't know if
you know or not,

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:36.966 position:50% align:center
but you should learn to
raise your hand like this

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.385 position:50% align:center
at crosswalks.

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:42.639 position:50% align:center
Seriously, I already told you
I'm 17 a million times!

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:44.307 position:50% align:center
Probably...

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.063 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA sighs]

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:55.276 position:50% align:center
At least, I believed in my heart
I was sorta close to that age.

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:58.822 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Mm.

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:02.158 position:50% align:center
Listen, I don't think you should
worry about it so much--

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:04.494 position:50% align:center
--Look, it's right here, Kimi!
--[KIMIZUKA] Hmm?

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:06.287 position:50% align:center
We just solved the case!

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.503 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Whoa, would ya look at that.

00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:21.052 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Uh. Wait,
wait, you aren't thinking

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:23.096 position:50% align:center
I'll just buy it?

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:24.347 position:50% align:center
Why wouldn't you?

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.266 position:50% align:center
Because I can't.

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:29.394 position:50% align:center
Why, are you poor or something?

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:32.647 position:50% align:center
You hush! Besides,
that's a common gemstone.

00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:35.483 position:50% align:center
What we're looking for
is far more elusive.

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:39.738 position:50% align:center
Maybe, like, hidden away
deep underground somewhere.

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:42.157 position:50% align:center
An underground treasure...

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:44.617 position:50% align:center
I've got it!

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:47.078 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
You haven't got it!

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:49.164 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty damn sure
you haven't got it!

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:51.458 position:50% align:center
Alicia! Please stop!

00:04:54.502 --> 00:04:55.754 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Huh?

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.759 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA panting]

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:06.681 position:50% align:center
No mistaking this is the place!

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:10.101 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] I swear you're
nothing but a mistake magnet.

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:11.644 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:13.605 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:15.357 position:50% align:center
She's gone?

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.233 position:50% align:center
What a pain.

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.694 position:50% align:center

Oh...

00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:26.076 position:50% align:center
This looks... really sweet.

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.160 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Alicia!

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:29.704 position:50% align:center
No! That's probably poisonous!

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:36.336 position:50% align:center
This is so exhausting.

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.047 position:50% align:center
Yeah right, getting
the lay of the land?

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.133 position:50% align:center
--More like babysitting.
--[ALICIA humming]

00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:43.718 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] When she
realized she had amnesia,

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:46.388 position:50% align:center
she was seriously shaken up.

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:50.934 position:50% align:center
But now she's overjoyed
to be a detective.

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.018 position:50% align:center
Are you having fun?

00:05:52.102 --> 00:05:53.812 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, so much fun!

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:56.731 position:50% align:center
It's been way too long
since I've been outside!

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:57.982 position:50% align:center
That's strange.

00:05:58.066 --> 00:05:59.150 position:50% align:center
Hmm?

00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:01.736 position:50% align:center
"Way too long"?
What do you mean by that?

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.321 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:07.492 position:50% align:center
No clue. Sometimes,
I just say what comes to

00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:09.202 position:50% align:center
the top of my head.

00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:11.663 position:50% align:center
Were you locked up in
a room somewhere?

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:13.289 position:50% align:center
Or maybe a hospital?

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:16.543 position:50% align:center
Was I? I don't remember.

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:19.087 position:50% align:center
And thinking about it
only makes my head throb...

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.547 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Well, don't
force yourself to recall

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.257 position:50% align:center
too much at once.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.800 position:50% align:center
Sometimes, with cases like this,

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:26.094 position:50% align:center
time sorts out
the details for you.

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:28.096 position:50% align:center
And you can rest assured
once Siesta feels better,

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:30.056 position:50% align:center
she'll help-- Um.

00:06:35.854 --> 00:06:37.814 position:50% align:center
See something you like?

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:39.190 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Look.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.902 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's definitely a "no."

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:44.988 position:50% align:center
You mean... that's not it?

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:46.573 position:50% align:center
Finding it on the street
like that would take

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.908 position:50% align:center
luck we don't have.

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:50.744 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA sighs] I think
maybe it might be a good time

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:53.121 position:50% align:center
for us to head on home.

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:54.664 position:50% align:center
Wha-- She's gone?!

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.126 position:50% align:center
--[ALICIA laughing]
--[KIMIZUKA] No!

00:06:58.209 --> 00:06:59.377 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:01.588 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Never a dull
moment with this girl.

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:04.799 position:50% align:center
Looks like my days will be
spent chasing after her.

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:34.746 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Here's to Siesta
and her full recovery.

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:37.207 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Cheers!

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.918 position:50% align:center
Wow. How many toasts
have we done already?

00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:41.836 position:50% align:center
I've lost count.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.255 position:50% align:center
I think that should be good
enough to be our last one.

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:45.924 position:50% align:center
I'm feeling nice and relaxed.

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:48.301 position:50% align:center
But I see something on
the menu I think you'd like.

00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:51.012 position:50% align:center
Okay. Go ahead
and order it for me.

00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:52.347 position:50% align:center
Wait...

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.807 position:50% align:center
Oh, jeez, it's already 9.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.850 position:50% align:center
Oh. Wow, 9?

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:58.645 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] You know, it's best
if you lay off the spicy food.

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:01.564 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I'm probably
going to get indigestion again

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:03.274 position:50% align:center
and won't be
able to sleep tonight.

00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:05.276 position:50% align:center
Well, then...
I have some antacid with me.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.737 position:50% align:center
You should take some,
to be on the safe side.

00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:09.823 position:50% align:center
That makes sense. Give it to me.

00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:17.330 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA] Whoa. It's freaky
watching you two work together.

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:20.417 position:50% align:center
Kimizuka, you let Siesta
decide everything for you,

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.961 position:50% align:center
while Siesta, it seems
like you do whatever he says

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:25.171 position:50% align:center
without any questions.

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:30.260 position:50% align:center
It's simple. We trust each other
more than we trust ourselves.

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:32.846 position:50% align:center
Basically, what you
mean is, you're love--

00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:35.432 position:50% align:center
Hi. Excuse me, waiter,
I would like to place

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:37.434 position:50% align:center
another order, please.

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:39.269 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Water off a duck's back.

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:41.438 position:50% align:center
Even obnoxious children
don't bother her.

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:43.481 position:50% align:center
You know it's wrong for her
to mock grown-ups.

00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:46.151 position:50% align:center
Funny you say that
when you act like a teenager!

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:49.738 position:50% align:center
I wanna have another drink.

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:54.617 position:50% align:center
Oh, waiter, I'll have
a Cinderella, please!

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:56.161 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Hmm. Man.

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:59.456 position:50% align:center
I'm so relieved you have a safe
place to stay now--with us.

Oh, yeah!

00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:03.043 position:50% align:center
And yesterday,
I even went to church.

00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:05.587 position:50% align:center
It was so fun, I loved it!

00:09:06.338 --> 00:09:08.131 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] Well, it sounds
like we're still just

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:11.384 position:50% align:center
treating the symptoms.
As long as you have no memory

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:13.470 position:50% align:center
and we can't
figure out who you are,

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:16.473 position:50% align:center
then we don't have a real
solution to our problem.

00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:20.310 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA] I had the chance to
play with a bunch of kids,

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:24.105 position:50% align:center
who're the only other
orphans I've ever met.

00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:27.359 position:50% align:center
I was so happy, it felt
just like being in school!

00:09:27.442 --> 00:09:28.860 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:33.615 position:50% align:center
I remember school.

00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:36.034 position:50% align:center
I haven't attended
in a while, either.

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:38.328 position:50% align:center
Why are you looking
at me like that?

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:42.082 position:50% align:center
The crepes and takoyaki
were pretty tasty, right?

00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:44.250 position:50% align:center
I only remember that I ate
way too much and ended up

00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:46.252 position:50% align:center
getting a terrible stomachache.

00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:51.549 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:52.842 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Hmph.

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:54.928 position:50% align:center
Is there something
you'd like to say?

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:56.846 position:50% align:center
Not a word.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.684 position:50% align:center
I have to admit,
that ribbon was cute on you.

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:04.104 position:50% align:center
I'd say you were
staring quite a bit.

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:08.108 position:50% align:center
I did not stare.
I was casually observing.

00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:10.026 position:50% align:center
Of course. I don't get it.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.738 position:50% align:center
Okay, now I think you're
just trying to mess with me.

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:16.116 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
A ribbon sounds nice.

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:19.285 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Okay. I'll get you one soon.

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:22.205 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Really? Yay!

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:25.083 position:50% align:center
I sure would love to wear one.

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:28.294 position:50% align:center
And try to enroll
at a real school...

00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:31.923 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA grunts]

00:10:32.007 --> 00:10:35.885 position:50% align:center
Actually, I probably don't need
to go to school at all, huh?

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:38.388 position:50% align:center
Because now,
I've got important work to do.

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:40.015 position:50% align:center
Like detective assignments?

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:43.601 position:50% align:center
Yep! I definitely don't have
time for homework and grades.

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:45.603 position:50% align:center
I have to assume
our mystery's unsolved,

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:48.231 position:50% align:center
as you still haven't found
the "Eye of Sapphire" anywhere.

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:50.692 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA growls]
Just get off my back.

00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:53.111 position:50% align:center
I know I gotta find it, okay?

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:55.447 position:50% align:center
Hey, hang on, you don't
mean you're going out now?

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.408 position:50% align:center
And I don't need you
to babysit me!

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:02.746 position:50% align:center
Of course, you are always such
an emotional roller coaster.

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:06.124 position:50% align:center
It's already dark outside.
The ghosts will be out.

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:10.378 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Maybe I'll go to bed early,

00:11:10.462 --> 00:11:13.048 position:50% align:center
so I can start detecting
in the morning.

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:17.260 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Ahem. Anyway, you'll see!

00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:20.472 position:50% align:center
There's no way I won't have
this mystery solved tomorrow!

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:25.560 position:50% align:center
[WAITER 7A]
Here you are.

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:27.270 position:50% align:center
One Cinderella.

00:11:27.354 --> 00:11:29.356 position:50% align:center
After those dramatics,
she took off without even

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:31.107 position:50% align:center
seeing her drink.

00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:33.777 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] She is most
definitely one of a kind.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.489 position:50% align:center
These past two weeks,
they must've been rough?

00:11:37.572 --> 00:11:39.449 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Eh.

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:41.785 position:50% align:center
Sort of, but what do we do now?

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:45.705 position:50% align:center
There's the Alicia question,
but then there's Hel, too.

00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:48.625 position:50% align:center
In my life, I have never
taken on a case

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:50.919 position:50% align:center
and then abandoned my mission.

00:11:51.002 --> 00:11:53.129 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA gasps]
I see.

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:54.756 position:50% align:center
So, we're planning
to go on living this way

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:56.424 position:50% align:center
for a while, then?

00:11:56.508 --> 00:12:00.595 position:50% align:center
I think so. Living together,
just the two of us.

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:04.432 position:50% align:center
You okay?

00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:06.142 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Yeah.

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:09.187 position:50% align:center
It's just, this is
really peaceful.

00:12:12.816 --> 00:12:15.151 position:50% align:center
You're wallowing
in sentimentality.

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:17.237 position:50% align:center
It's not anything like that.

00:12:20.699 --> 00:12:21.658 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Hey, what is this?!

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:24.077 position:50% align:center
Crap, that's bitter.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.579 position:50% align:center
I am on to you--

00:12:26.663 --> 00:12:29.290 position:50% align:center
Come on, it's only juice.

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:31.167 position:50% align:center
We're celebrating
me today, right?

00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:34.504 position:50% align:center
Live a little with me for once.

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:36.965 position:50% align:center
Want anything? To drink, I mean.

00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:39.676 position:50% align:center
I said, I've had enough.

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:42.387 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] You have to make
something up to me, remember?

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.763 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
What are you talking about?

00:12:43.847 --> 00:12:47.517 position:50% align:center
Oh, that apple pie incident
from a while back?

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.811 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
I thought...

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:52.439 position:50% align:center
...you'd do whatever I ask?

00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:54.190 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA gulps]

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:57.444 position:50% align:center
Fine, only one more, though.

00:12:57.527 --> 00:13:00.113 position:50% align:center
Sure. Cross my heart.

00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:07.662 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA slurring]
And then, you know what?

00:13:07.746 --> 00:13:10.749 position:50% align:center
When I was a little girl, I ate
these watermelon seeds one time,

00:13:10.832 --> 00:13:13.043 position:50% align:center
and then... I was so nervous
'cause, like,

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:15.337 position:50% align:center
what do I do if they suddenly
sprout in my stomach

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.339 position:50% align:center
and come out of my mouth?

00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:19.883 position:50% align:center
Are things starting
to get wobbly in here, or...

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:23.261 position:50% align:center
...am I starting to fade
because I'm so exhausted?

00:13:23.345 --> 00:13:25.388 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] "Just one more,"
she kept promising me

00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:27.432 position:50% align:center
over and over again.

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:30.185 position:50% align:center
By the time we left,
she'd said it for ten rounds.

00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:34.189 position:50% align:center
Ah! Sidekick, are you listening
to a word I'm saying?

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:35.982 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course I'm listening.

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:38.485 position:50% align:center
You were talking about whether
watermelons are a vegetable

00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:39.778 position:50% align:center
or a fruit?

00:13:39.861 --> 00:13:41.738 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Hmm. You are listening!

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:43.740 position:50% align:center
I mean, the grocery store
gave me a muskmelon

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:45.408 position:50% align:center
when I actually asked
for a watermelon,

00:13:45.492 --> 00:13:47.619 position:50% align:center
and I was, like, truly shocked.

00:13:47.702 --> 00:13:49.037 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] We've been
talking past each other,

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.206 position:50% align:center
and from what I can tell...

00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:54.501 position:50% align:center
...she's been feeding me nothing
but nonsense this entire time.

00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:56.419 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
I find this quite suspicious.

00:13:56.503 --> 00:13:58.755 position:50% align:center
Why would the perfectly
flawless, calm, and collected

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:01.633 position:50% align:center
greatest legendary detective
in history spew out

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:03.718 position:50% align:center
such useless babble?

00:14:03.802 --> 00:14:06.888 position:50% align:center
Maybe she's speaking in a
top-secret code or something.

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:09.265 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Umm...

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:13.103 position:50% align:center
Why have you stayed so far
away from me this whole time?

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:14.270 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA gulps]

00:14:16.815 --> 00:14:19.401 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Why don't you come over here?

00:14:19.484 --> 00:14:21.319 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
On the bed...?

00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:24.864 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. Let's sit closer
and have a little convo.

00:14:24.948 --> 00:14:25.865 position:50% align:center
Don't you think...

00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:27.492 position:50% align:center
...it's awkward?

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:31.121 position:50% align:center
A young guy and a girl
sitting alone on a... bed.

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:32.706 position:50% align:center
So, no...?

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:37.002 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA gulps]
Of course, it's no problem.

00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:40.839 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA giggles]
I'd say being in bed together is

00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:43.550 position:50% align:center
an important first for
us, wouldn't you?

00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:45.260 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA sighs]

00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:50.015 position:50% align:center
I feel like we're
really close, Kimi.

00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:51.891 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:51.975 --> 00:14:53.935 position:50% align:center
But... You do have
the kind of face

00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:56.271 position:50% align:center
that's easy to forget quickly.

00:14:56.354 --> 00:14:59.399 position:50% align:center
Hey, why would you say that?

00:14:59.482 --> 00:15:02.944 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA giggles] It's because
tormenting you is fun.

00:15:03.028 --> 00:15:05.113 position:50% align:center
And besides...

00:15:05.196 --> 00:15:08.074 position:50% align:center
I think you kind of like being
tormented by me, don't you?

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:12.579 position:50% align:center
Stop making up
such absurd things.

00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:16.791 position:50% align:center
So, would you prefer I never toy
with you ever again, or what?

00:15:18.168 --> 00:15:20.211 position:50% align:center
Would you prefer
I not talk to you?

00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:23.173 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA groans]

00:15:23.965 --> 00:15:28.678 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA giggles] You really are
kind of perfect, I hate it.

00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:31.348 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA groans]
Shut up.

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:34.017 position:50% align:center
That sad face of yours
is so sweet.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.645 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] That's not...
exactly a compliment.

00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:41.399 position:50% align:center
Who knows, I might forget it
in a couple of days though.

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:45.153 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
But still...

00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:46.863 position:50% align:center
There's no forgetting
the last three years

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:48.990 position:50% align:center
we've spent together.

00:15:49.074 --> 00:15:50.950 position:50% align:center
I've been lucky to have you.

00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:57.374 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA giggles] I feel like
this conversation has gotten

00:15:57.457 --> 00:15:59.000 position:50% align:center
a little too serious.

00:15:59.084 --> 00:16:02.629 position:50% align:center
What would be left of you if
you took away your serious tone?

00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:04.714 position:50% align:center
That's offensive--
it sounds like you think

00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:06.883 position:50% align:center
I'm not any fun at all.

00:16:07.926 --> 00:16:09.719 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
So, just for once...

00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:11.721 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:15.725 position:50% align:center
...want to do something...
not so serious?

00:16:15.809 --> 00:16:17.811 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA whimpering]

00:16:19.104 --> 00:16:20.939 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:32.826 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA groans]

00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:47.465 position:50% align:center
Whoa... Man, I feel like death.

00:16:47.549 --> 00:16:49.426 position:50% align:center
I don't know what
yesterday's me was thinking,

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:51.761 position:50% align:center
but no way this doesn't
complicate things.

00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:53.638 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA groans]

00:16:58.476 --> 00:17:01.563 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Hmm?

00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:03.148 position:50% align:center
Good morning.

00:17:04.983 --> 00:17:06.359 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA groans]

hold out your arm for me.

[KIMIZUKA]
Bu-- Uh-- Easy now, Siesta.

00:17:40.685 --> 00:17:41.978 position:50% align:center
Let's discuss things
before you pull out

00:17:42.062 --> 00:17:44.814 position:50% align:center
a super scary syringe, okay?

00:17:44.898 --> 00:17:47.734 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] It's fine--
it'll only hurt for a second.

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:51.363 position:50% align:center
The solution in this shot
has the power to erase

00:17:51.446 --> 00:17:53.323 position:50% align:center
any recent memories.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:55.408 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA whimpers]

00:17:55.492 --> 00:17:56.868 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] Remember when we
captured that "restroom Hanako"

00:17:56.951 --> 00:17:58.745 position:50% align:center
at the big festival?

00:17:58.828 --> 00:18:01.122 position:50% align:center
This contains a tiny bit of
the same drug that caused

00:18:01.206 --> 00:18:03.833 position:50% align:center
memory loss for all those
people at your school.

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:05.710 position:50% align:center
Whoa! That's horrifying.

00:18:05.794 --> 00:18:09.130 position:50% align:center
It's been conclusively
proven to be effective!

00:18:10.382 --> 00:18:13.802 position:50% align:center
Stay still, Sidekick.

Sounds like somebody's here.

00:18:23.353 --> 00:18:25.522 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't we answer?

00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:26.564 position:50% align:center
Tch!

00:18:26.648 --> 00:18:28.274 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Don't hiss like that.

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:31.236 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:36.991 position:50% align:center
It sounded really scary in here.
What're you two doing?

00:18:37.075 --> 00:18:38.368 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Hmm.

00:18:40.537 --> 00:18:43.206 position:50% align:center
I did it! I solved our mystery!

00:18:44.082 --> 00:18:45.959 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] You didn't really
go find the "Eye of Sapphire"

00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:48.962 position:50% align:center
or anything like that
last night, did you?

00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:50.839 position:50% align:center
I don't know if the
"Eye of Sapphire" is something

00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:54.092 position:50% align:center
someone made up, so it's
more important to take care of

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:57.554 position:50% align:center
your hurt eye,
which definitely exists.

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:02.017 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Hmm!

00:19:04.144 --> 00:19:05.854 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you noticed.

00:19:05.937 --> 00:19:07.814 position:50% align:center
Duh, we've only been
working closely together

00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:09.649 position:50% align:center
for two whole weeks.

00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:11.067 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Hmm.

00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:12.902 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] My vision was
getting worse after my left eye

00:19:12.986 --> 00:19:16.156 position:50% align:center
was wounded in that battle
with Hel and Chameleon.

00:19:16.239 --> 00:19:18.408 position:50% align:center
That was the reason
I kept losing track of Alicia

00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:20.076 position:50% align:center
darting around town.

00:19:20.952 --> 00:19:22.871 position:50% align:center
I don't think it's gonna heal
unless you start wearing

00:19:22.954 --> 00:19:24.914 position:50% align:center
an eye patch.

00:19:24.998 --> 00:19:26.791 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
I'm beginning to realize...

00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:29.377 position:50% align:center
...I may have been
misreading this little girl.

00:19:30.295 --> 00:19:33.590 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] She came off as such
a chaotic and emotional child.

00:19:33.673 --> 00:19:36.217 position:50% align:center
A whirlwind of mischief.

00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:40.972 position:50% align:center
But as time passes,
I see her aim is true.

00:19:41.056 --> 00:19:44.225 position:50% align:center
And that's gonna be
my final answer, am I right?

00:19:44.309 --> 00:19:47.729 position:50% align:center
Uh. So what is
she talking about?

00:19:47.812 --> 00:19:50.607 position:50% align:center
Was this the outcome
you wanted this whole time?

00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:54.361 position:50% align:center
Yes, just as I calculated.

00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:56.696 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Wow, you are not a good liar.

00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:02.744 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] So what if quick-witted
responses aren't my forte?

00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:04.162 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] It's been
too long since I've seen

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:05.580 position:50% align:center
that look on your face.

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:08.833 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
You can hush now.

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:10.919 position:50% align:center
Aren't you a bit too fond?

00:20:11.002 --> 00:20:13.546 position:50% align:center
Of a present that you got
from a much-younger girl?

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:17.092 position:50% align:center
Uh. No, absolutely not--
it's nothing like that.

00:20:17.175 --> 00:20:19.511 position:50% align:center
I thought she showed me
genuine kindness.

00:20:21.054 --> 00:20:22.472 position:50% align:center
That was wrong of me.

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:24.140 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:20:24.224 --> 00:20:27.227 position:50% align:center
The truth of the matter is I'm
just ashamed of myself because

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:29.396 position:50% align:center
I failed to show the same
kind of consideration

00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:31.272 position:50% align:center
about your injured eye.

00:20:32.691 --> 00:20:34.275 position:50% align:center
Is that all it is?

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:37.153 position:50% align:center
It's nice to know
you're human, too.

00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:39.114 position:50% align:center
I had no idea you
could be swayed by such

00:20:39.197 --> 00:20:41.282 position:50% align:center
silly emotions so easily.

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:43.910 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Is that so?

00:20:54.546 --> 00:20:55.672 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:20:56.673 --> 00:20:58.008 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Nothing.

00:21:02.178 --> 00:21:04.639 position:50% align:center

kept yourself alive.

show at the parliament building.

Hey, Fuubi. Isn't that something

00:21:21.156 --> 00:21:23.450 position:50% align:center
you should've said
last time we met up?

00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:25.577 position:50% align:center
Actually, we took quite
a beating as a result of

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:29.039 position:50% align:center
the Jack the Ripper
case you brought our way.

00:21:29.122 --> 00:21:32.042 position:50% align:center
Huh? When do you think
we last met up?

00:21:32.125 --> 00:21:35.170 position:50% align:center
It was just two weeks ago,
Fuubi, so not too long.

00:21:35.253 --> 00:21:38.840 position:50% align:center
Don't you remember how you told
us about the "Eye of Sapphire"?

00:21:38.923 --> 00:21:40.967 position:50% align:center
[FUUBI]
Uh. Never happened.

00:21:41.051 --> 00:21:43.678 position:50% align:center

was at the church.

possibly mistaken me for?

[KIMIZUKA] If it wasn't you,
then... who was...?

00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:53.813 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Oh no, I remember now.

00:21:53.897 --> 00:21:57.525 position:50% align:center
Fuubi used the lighter she'd
already given me days before.
