[SIESTA sighs]

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:23.356 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Feels great, doesn't it?

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.899 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:26.484 position:50% align:center
If by "feels great," you mean
the beach we're standing on,

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:27.986 position:50% align:center
then I agree.

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:30.071 position:50% align:center
But also, I have to be the stick
in the mud who reminds you

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:32.032 position:50% align:center
of our purpose here.

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:33.533 position:50% align:center
Which is what?

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:35.410 position:50% align:center
You know, to get our hands on
the rumored "Emerald Tear"

00:00:35.493 --> 00:00:37.162 position:50% align:center
and finally make a little money.

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:39.456 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, we're flat broke--

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.875 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] Too bad! Since you
failed to dodge my attack,

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.461 position:50% align:center
you must reconcile by
being my servant for life.

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:46.338 position:50% align:center
That seems like a pretty
extreme penalty for not

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:48.256 position:50% align:center
dodging a beach ball.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.508 position:50% align:center
Come on, just try to
hit it back to me.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:54.179 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA sighs] I doubt
this game will be much fun

00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:56.306 position:50% align:center
with only two people.

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:58.141 position:50% align:center
I see. Is that your way
of saying you don't like

00:00:58.224 --> 00:00:59.684 position:50% align:center
playing games with me?

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:01.144 position:50% align:center
Huh? Uh, no?

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:02.729 position:50% align:center
That's not even close
to what I meant.

00:01:02.812 --> 00:01:04.564 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Oh!

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:06.691 position:50% align:center
Wanna go for a ride together?

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:10.737 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA grunting]

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.865 position:50% align:center
Are you seriously not planning
to row a single stroke?

00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:15.533 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] I'm too busy
honoring the occasion,

00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:18.620 position:50% align:center
since this is your very
first task as my servant.

00:01:18.703 --> 00:01:21.122 position:50% align:center
This is hardly the first
task you've given me.

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:23.041 position:50% align:center
I always have to do
what you say regardless of

00:01:23.124 --> 00:01:24.501 position:50% align:center
any game penalties.

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:26.002 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:29.130 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA gasps]

00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:31.591 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] You know, you're in
surprisingly good shape.

00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:34.594 position:50% align:center
Will you cut it out?

00:01:34.678 --> 00:01:36.513 position:50% align:center
Why? Nobody's looking.

00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:39.849 position:50% align:center
Jeez, are you really
gonna set the bar for

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.435 position:50% align:center
what's acceptable that low?

00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:45.647 position:50% align:center
Stop.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.023 position:50% align:center
Just as I thought.

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:49.401 position:50% align:center
You're not having fun.

00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:51.945 position:50% align:center
Again, that's not
what I'm saying.

00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:57.659 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] I'm just...
realizing how far we've come.

00:01:57.742 --> 00:02:02.497 position:50% align:center
I mean, from when I met you
on a plane mid-flight, to now,

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.124 position:50% align:center
it's been two years already.

00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:06.668 position:50% align:center
Now we're at the beach.

00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:09.004 position:50% align:center
So? What's your point?

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:11.423 position:50% align:center
Tell me, Kimi--
Are you enjoying yourself?

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:12.716 position:50% align:center
Or are you not?

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.175 position:50% align:center
I dunno.

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:17.429 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'll let you know when
this journey ends someday.

00:02:17.512 --> 00:02:19.764 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Hmm. I see.

00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:21.933 position:50% align:center
If that's your preference...

00:02:22.017 --> 00:02:25.020 position:50% align:center
Oh. But if you're planning to
profess any feelings for me,

00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:26.813 position:50% align:center
you'd better do it soon.

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:28.857 position:50% align:center
I happen to be
in high-demand, you know.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.901 position:50% align:center
Wasn't planning on it,
but thanks for the offer anyway.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.903 position:50% align:center
Yes, well, be that as it may...

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:35.321 position:50% align:center
Be what as it may?

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.073 position:50% align:center
Once we've acquired
the jewel and eaten enough

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.659 position:50% align:center
tasty meat dishes
to make us explode,

00:02:39.743 --> 00:02:42.579 position:50% align:center
what if we were to set up
a detective office somewhere?

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:44.956 position:50% align:center
Personally, it sounds a bit
ambitious for a person

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.083 position:50% align:center
who doesn't have
a penny to their name.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.793 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA giggles]

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:50.754 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] And that was how
our brief summer vacation

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:53.673 position:50% align:center
passed by, and our
absurd day-to-day life as

00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:58.261 position:50% align:center
detective and
sidekick/servant, continued.

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:37.027 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] Hmm... This is
the work of Cerberus.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.112 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA (nasally)]
"Cerberus"?

00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:40.864 position:50% align:center
That's an odd voice.

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.073 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA (nasally)]
Yeah, I don't handle

00:04:42.157 --> 00:04:44.242 position:50% align:center
the smell of blood well.

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:48.747 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] Do you have any idea
how ridiculous you look?

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.832 position:50% align:center
Do you plan to work like that?

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:53.251 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA sighs]
Look, can we just please focus

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:55.253 position:50% align:center
on this Cerberus thing?

00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:58.131 position:50% align:center
You think it's
a Jack the Ripper copycat?

00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:00.800 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] That's right,
codenamed Cerberus,

00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:02.969 position:50% align:center
the guard-dog of
the underworld.

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:06.181 position:50% align:center
Rumor has it that the killer
gobbles up human hearts.

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:07.849 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Ugh...

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:12.562 position:50% align:center
Guess I was a bit late.

00:05:14.773 --> 00:05:16.107 position:50% align:center
No smoking!

00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:17.525 position:50% align:center
Fine, you hold it.

00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:18.651 position:50% align:center
But...

00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:21.529 position:50% align:center
It's almost time for my flight.

00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:23.490 position:50% align:center
I've got to get back to Japan.

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:26.034 position:50% align:center
What? Already?
Hold on a second,

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:29.120 position:50% align:center
then what was the purpose
of you even coming here?

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:30.663 position:50% align:center
It was just temporary.

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:33.416 position:50% align:center
I was transferred--
ended yesterday.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.294 position:50% align:center
Sounds like
a pretty brief transfer.

00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:37.629 position:50% align:center
Yep, so anyway...

00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:40.048 position:50% align:center
I'm going to leave
this case up to you guys.

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:41.549 position:50% align:center
Fairly sure you'll
be able to nab

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:44.177 position:50% align:center
this Jack the Ripper knockoff.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.721 position:50% align:center
Wait. Are you serious right now?

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:50.475 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA sighs]
Unbelievable.

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:53.895 position:50% align:center
Talk about rude.

00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:56.022 position:50% align:center
What's that you've got there?

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:57.315 position:50% align:center
It's Ms. Fuubi's lighter.

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:59.150 position:50% align:center
She gave it to me
before she left.

00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:00.944 position:50% align:center
She said she didn't need it
anymore because she was

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:02.404 position:50% align:center
giving up smoking.

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:03.947 position:50% align:center
Ah, I understand.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.241 position:50% align:center
She handed over her most
valued possession to a guy

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:08.993 position:50% align:center
she was reconnecting with
after a long time. Right?

00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:10.704 position:50% align:center
Yeah, she handed over too much.

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:12.664 position:50% align:center
Not just a half-smoked
cigar and lighter,

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:15.166 position:50% align:center
but a serial-killer
investigation, too.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.962 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Okay.
What's the killer's motive?

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:22.841 position:50% align:center
Why is this Cerberus guy going
around ripping out hearts?

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:25.260 position:50% align:center
Honestly, it's hard to imagine
Cerberus choosing to commit

00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:27.721 position:50% align:center
these crimes on his own.

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:29.347 position:50% align:center
So I believe these orders
have to be coming

00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:31.766 position:50% align:center
from a higher entity.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.436 position:50% align:center
Oh? Do you think it's SPES?

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:36.521 position:50% align:center
Well... We can gather more
evidence once we've

00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:38.648 position:50% align:center
captured our suspect.

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:41.109 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Have you thought of a plan yet?

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:43.278 position:50% align:center
It's probably no surprise
to you, Kimi,

00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:44.696 position:50% align:center
but I was already
well aware of the crimes

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.322 position:50% align:center
Cerberus was committing.

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:48.908 position:50% align:center
Sure, that makes sense--I doubt
a case as extreme as this one

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:50.994 position:50% align:center
would ever escape
your attention.

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:53.496 position:50% align:center
It seems our suspect
has a great nose.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.749 position:50% align:center
Because no matter
how close I manage to get,

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:58.168 position:50% align:center
the killer keeps getting away.

00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.753 position:50% align:center
Bat has his ear thing,

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:01.629 position:50% align:center
so perhaps Cerberus
could be an android with

00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:04.132 position:50% align:center
a reconstructed nose
or something similar.

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:07.344 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA groans]

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:09.179 position:50% align:center
What's strange,
is our presence in town

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:11.306 position:50% align:center
should be obvious,
but these unspeakable crimes

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:14.267 position:50% align:center
are still being committed, and
Cerberus should've fled by now.

00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:15.560 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
A trap?

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:19.856 position:50% align:center
Actually, I was going
to call it a big opportunity.

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:21.232 position:50% align:center
Yeah, so you say.

00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:24.110 position:50% align:center
But how do you suggest
we go about this pursuit?

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:25.653 position:50% align:center
You've got it all backwards.

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:28.656 position:50% align:center
See, we're not going to be
the ones who pursue Cerberus.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.159 position:50% align:center
Cerberus is going to be
the one to pursue us.

00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:32.660 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:38.375 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Hold on, are you
planning to make me the decoy?

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:41.961 position:50% align:center
You know, your deduction skills
have really improved.

00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:43.755 position:50% align:center
So what do you say
we iron out the details

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:45.757 position:50% align:center
over some afternoon tea?

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.259 position:50% align:center
You've gotta be the only human
being on this entire planet

00:07:48.343 --> 00:07:50.095 position:50% align:center
who can go straight from
a gruesome murder scene

00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:51.888 position:50% align:center
to an afternoon tea.

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:53.890 position:50% align:center
Even more strange,
weren't you gorging yourself

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:56.643 position:50% align:center
on a giant roast
before we came here?

00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:59.437 position:50% align:center
It's not my fault--I'm
constantly exhausting my brain,

00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:01.398 position:50% align:center
so my three basic cravings
are somewhat stronger

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:02.816 position:50% align:center
than the average person's.

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:05.193 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah? Is that why
you're always napping?

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:06.444 position:50% align:center
You're one to talk.

00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:09.572 position:50% align:center
You're not exactly
a morning person, either.

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:13.284 position:50% align:center
You said your three basic
cravings are stronger?

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:19.666 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] My mistake,
I only meant food and sleep.

00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:24.004 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] It's almost been
three years since we started

00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:26.548 position:50% align:center
traveling the world together.

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:29.217 position:50% align:center
And yet, it feels like
the blink of an eye.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.595 position:50% align:center
Wow, you sure did pick a strange
time to start reminiscing.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.431 position:50% align:center
You are planning on
coming to save me before

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:36.141 position:50% align:center
I get murdered, right?

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:41.521 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Sidekick or no, I have
no intentions of dying for you.

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:45.692 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Anyway, will this really work?

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:48.445 position:50% align:center
You think they'll show up?

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:51.489 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] Not to worry. If I've
read the situation correctly,

00:08:51.573 --> 00:08:52.907 position:50% align:center
it's quite possible
that, tonight,

00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:54.784 position:50% align:center
you'll be devoured by Cerberus.

00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:57.328 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
So I'm just gonna be killed?

00:08:57.412 --> 00:08:58.705 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA]
Hard to say.

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:01.291 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure if today
will be the day or not.

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:02.751 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
I guess that's fair.

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:04.794 position:50% align:center
We're only saying it's more
probable that Cerberus

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:07.213 position:50% align:center
will target me when
I'm separated from you.

00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:09.382 position:50% align:center
For what it's worth,
I do have an idea,

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:10.717 position:50% align:center
so whenever you're attacked,

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.636 position:50% align:center
there's one chance
in 10,000 you'll live.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.806 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA sighs] You know,
Siesta, I'd be lying if I said

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.641 position:50% align:center
I was in love with those odds.

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:21.061 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA sighs]
I can't come near you,

00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:23.563 position:50% align:center
but I'll at least stay on
the phone with you all night.

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:26.441 position:50% align:center
After all, I wouldn't
want you getting too lonely.

Oh! I get it, Siesta
must have sent you here

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.201 position:50% align:center
to keep me company,
is that right?

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:19.536 position:50% align:center
Of course!

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:22.372 position:50% align:center
Seriously, using all of
your might to hurl a girl

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.207 position:50% align:center
down onto a bed like that.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.793 position:50% align:center
Where on earth did you
learn such boorish behavior?

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:29.421 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you have the
nerve to lecture me right now.

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:31.589 position:50% align:center
You snuck into my room
in the middle of the night.

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:33.216 position:50% align:center
What exactly did you think
was going to happen

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:34.634 position:50% align:center
with that approach?

00:10:34.718 --> 00:10:36.094 position:50% align:center
I didn't have a choice.

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:38.138 position:50% align:center
Since there was a possibility
that Cerberus might have

00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:39.806 position:50% align:center
gotten here ahead of me.

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:43.351 position:50% align:center
Uh... Yeah, well, be that as it
may, Siesta could have at least

00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:47.022 position:50% align:center
told me that she was
planning on sending you here.

00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:48.648 position:50% align:center
Keeping things under wraps
is just a part

00:10:48.732 --> 00:10:50.692 position:50% align:center
of Siesta's strategy, right?

Start talking.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.828 position:50% align:center

to Siesta by her actual name.

Hmph. How impressive.

[SIESTA sniffs]

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:30.810 position:50% align:center
Well, to put it simply, it's
because up until a moment ago,

00:13:30.894 --> 00:13:32.854 position:50% align:center
this room was full
of a special gas.

00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:34.814 position:50% align:center

this would happen,

to the water?

As a result, Cerberus's sense
of smell was incapacitated.

As usual, it seems like
you've thought of everything.

faith you'd do exactly

what you did.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:38.581 position:50% align:center
about a partner.

00:16:38.665 --> 00:16:41.710 position:50% align:center
What do you mean, "partner"?
I'm not following this.

00:16:41.793 --> 00:16:45.130 position:50% align:center
How could working with me
possibly benefit you?

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:47.340 position:50% align:center
You certainly have
a low opinion of yourself.

00:16:47.424 --> 00:16:49.300 position:50% align:center
I would prefer
to call it modesty.

00:16:49.384 --> 00:16:50.969 position:50% align:center
[HEL chuckles]

00:16:52.095 --> 00:16:54.222 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] I see you're
capable of laughing.

00:16:55.932 --> 00:16:57.934 position:50% align:center
[HEL]
Hmph. Yes, why wouldn't I be?

00:16:58.018 --> 00:16:59.894 position:50% align:center
I'm like any other normal girl.

00:16:59.978 --> 00:17:02.480 position:50% align:center
Most of the normal girls I know
don't go around murdering

00:17:02.564 --> 00:17:04.816 position:50% align:center
their compatriots
without any mercy.

00:17:04.899 --> 00:17:07.402 position:50% align:center
My compatriot? Certainly not.

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:09.279 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid the mongrel
was no more than a cog

00:17:09.362 --> 00:17:11.031 position:50% align:center
in a much grander scheme.

00:17:11.114 --> 00:17:14.534 position:50% align:center
So I'm guessing that you'll use
and discard me in the same way?

00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:17.579 position:50% align:center
I would never do
anything so crass.

00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:18.955 position:50% align:center
Still...

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:24.836 position:50% align:center
The things inscribed in
the Sacred Writ are absolute.

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:26.880 position:50% align:center
The Sacred Writ?

00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:30.175 position:50% align:center
[HEL] Tell me, have you ever
heard of the Leaves of Agastya?

00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:31.676 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] I seem to
recall something about

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.137 position:50% align:center
a prophetic scripture
written before the common era

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.847 position:50% align:center
by a certain sage.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.808 position:50% align:center
[HEL] Yes. You see,
the Sacred Writ originated with

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:41.394 position:50% align:center
the Leaves of Agastya
as its basis.

00:17:41.478 --> 00:17:43.730 position:50% align:center
Believe it or not,
your future is written within

00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:45.482 position:50% align:center
these very pages.

00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:47.734 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA growls]

00:17:47.817 --> 00:17:50.195 position:50% align:center
Judging from that look,
you think I'm joking.

00:17:50.278 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center
You're right. It's not personal.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.741 position:50% align:center
Besides myself, there's only
one other person on this planet

00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:56.659 position:50% align:center
that I can trust.

00:17:58.661 --> 00:18:00.538 position:50% align:center
[HEL] You're what I'd call
a magnet for trouble.

00:18:00.622 --> 00:18:01.706 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:04.376 position:50% align:center
[HEL]
That's your true nature, right?

00:18:04.459 --> 00:18:07.337 position:50% align:center
What? How do you know?

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.547 position:50% align:center
[HEL] While I doubt you
really want my opinion,

00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:11.841 position:50% align:center
I believe your nature is
a bit different from that.

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:13.760 position:50% align:center
You're not a magnet
for trouble...

00:18:13.843 --> 00:18:15.220 position:50% align:center
...it's more that
you draw it out.

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:16.846 position:50% align:center
Make sense?

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.848 position:50% align:center
I can't say that it does.

00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:22.185 position:50% align:center
Let's just say your talent is
the ability to cause changes

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:23.687 position:50% align:center
and to provoke incidents.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:27.190 position:50% align:center
Best described as a sort
of pivot-point for the world.

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:29.067 position:50% align:center
And that's why...

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.611 position:50% align:center
...I'm going to have you
become my partner.

00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:33.446 position:50% align:center
If we work together,

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:36.616 position:50% align:center
then we can save this world.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.285 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure you mean
"destroy the world."

00:18:39.369 --> 00:18:42.455 position:50% align:center
[HEL] And who's to say that
isn't its own form of salvation?

00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:45.250 position:50% align:center
Well. In accordance with
the Sacred Writ.

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:47.794 position:50% align:center
Your joining me will
apparently come at a later date

00:18:47.877 --> 00:18:49.337 position:50% align:center
and it's inevitable.

00:18:49.421 --> 00:18:52.924 position:50% align:center
But having things move along at
a faster pace is my Father's--

[gasps]

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:56.219 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:57.971 position:50% align:center
[HEL] You know,
it's rather unfortunate.

00:18:58.054 --> 00:19:00.265 position:50% align:center
Not to brag too much,
but there are quite a few perks

00:19:00.348 --> 00:19:02.726 position:50% align:center
in partnering up with me.

00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:05.145 position:50% align:center
What do you say?
It could be fun.

00:19:05.228 --> 00:19:07.272 position:50% align:center

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:09.691 position:50% align:center
...be my partner, will you?

00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:12.902 position:50% align:center
You're right,
it is inevitable...

00:19:12.986 --> 00:19:14.946 position:50% align:center
...that I refuse.

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.115 position:50% align:center
You didn't seriously think
I was going to take your hand,

00:19:17.198 --> 00:19:18.324 position:50% align:center
did you?

00:19:18.408 --> 00:19:21.036 position:50% align:center
Don't be absurd.
Of course not.

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:22.370 position:50% align:center
On a different note,

00:19:22.454 --> 00:19:25.081 position:50% align:center
there is a little something
I'd like you to see.

This.

What's that... thing?

00:19:37.969 --> 00:19:40.388 position:50% align:center
It's a biological weapon.

This guy exhales
a special breath

00:19:45.268 --> 00:19:47.312 position:50% align:center
that contains dangerous toxins.

[KIMIZUKA]
So you'll use it to engage

00:19:48.605 --> 00:19:50.440 position:50% align:center
in some sort of terrorism?

00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:52.192 position:50% align:center
Yes, exactly.

That reminds me...

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:56.363 position:50% align:center
I don't believe I ever
answered your question

about where we are.

00:19:59.449 --> 00:20:02.285 position:50% align:center

the ability to set up something

like this in the nation's
nucleus of power,

00:20:10.293 --> 00:20:11.628 position:50% align:center
