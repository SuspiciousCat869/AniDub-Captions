00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:22.480 position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:24.190 position:50% align:center
While you're being swarmed
by the other guys,

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:25.900 position:50% align:center
I'll take down the main enemy.

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:27.318 position:50% align:center
Hold on a sec.

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:29.779 position:50% align:center
Can't you pick a plan that
doesn't end with my death?

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.990 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. I'll take
full responsibility

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:34.951 position:50% align:center
and delete your computer's
search history, okay?

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:36.286 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Seriously?!

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:38.288 position:50% align:center
Wait... What'd you say?

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:40.832 position:50% align:center
You haven't actually looked
at my search history, right?

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:44.002 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
For three whole years,

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:48.298 position:50% align:center
Siesta and I's dramatic
adventure unfolded.

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:52.552 position:50% align:center
We battled humanity's
enemies side-by-side.

00:00:54.512 --> 00:00:56.514 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] It's been a year
since those crazy days

00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:58.391 position:50% align:center
came to an end.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:02.020 position:50% align:center
As a high-school senior,
I have now immersed myself

00:01:02.103 --> 00:01:04.064 position:50% align:center
from head to toe,
wholeheartedly,

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:07.817 position:50% align:center
in the lukewarm water
that I call "everyday life."

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:10.403 position:50% align:center
"Is it enough," you ask?

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:11.863 position:50% align:center
It is.

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:14.741 position:50% align:center
This life of mine
impinges on no one.

00:01:14.824 --> 00:01:17.202 position:50% align:center
That's how it's been.

00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:19.996 position:50% align:center
Since the detective
is already dead.

00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:24.292 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
You're the legendary detective?

00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:00.930 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] At present...
I'm being threatened

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:04.392 position:50% align:center
by a girl I've never
seen before.

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:07.020 position:50% align:center
The reason why
is a complete mystery.

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:09.397 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Answer me already!

00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:11.524 position:50% align:center
Are you actually
the legendary detective?

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:13.651 position:50% align:center
Kimihiko Kimizuka?

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:15.820 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
"Detective."

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:19.074 position:50% align:center
It's been a while
since I've heard that word.

00:03:19.157 --> 00:03:21.451 position:50% align:center
You must be mistaken.
Excuse me.

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:22.452 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Hold on!

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:23.912 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:25.538 position:50% align:center
Give me a proper answer!

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:29.459 position:50% align:center
Or I will touch your uvula,
without any mercy whatsoever!

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.920 position:50% align:center
Are you Kimihiko Kimizuka?

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:33.338 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA murmuring]

00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:35.674 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
What's that?! I can't hear you!

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:36.883 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA coughs]

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:40.053 position:50% align:center
Ew, that's disgusting!
It's unbearably rude

00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:44.224 position:50% align:center
to drool all over the fingers
of a girl you've only just met.

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:47.018 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] What is up with
this girl's weird behavior?

00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:49.729 position:50% align:center
Am I being punished
or something?

00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:51.648 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Wait a second.

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:53.692 position:50% align:center
I know what's happening.

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:00.824 position:50% align:center
I think you just need me
to give you a little hug.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:02.367 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA grunts]

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.914 position:50% align:center
[heart thumping]

00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:10.333 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA gasps]
No! No, no no!

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:12.961 position:50% align:center
What exactly are you
trying to do here?!

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:14.546 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Too bad.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.340 position:50% align:center
'Cause we really could have
had a bit more fun with this.

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:19.634 position:50% align:center
You don't need to throw your
body around to "have fun,"

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:22.345 position:50% align:center
and don't offer up your chest
to some guy you don't even know.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.681 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:29.019 position:50% align:center
Nagisa Natsunagi.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.730 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Uh...
Could you maybe wipe off

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:33.857 position:50% align:center
your hand first, at least?

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:37.819 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Look, I came here

00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:40.280 position:50% align:center
because I have
a request for you.

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:44.117 position:50% align:center
I'm looking for someone.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.579 position:50% align:center
And I've heard
you're a detective?

00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:49.914 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Unfortunately,
you've got the wrong person.

00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:51.624 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Is that so?

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:55.754 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
"High-School Hero."

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:57.505 position:50% align:center
"A Pro at Finding Lost Pets."

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:59.841 position:50% align:center
"Direct-Deposit Scammer
Gang Apprehended."

00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:02.385 position:50% align:center
"Surprise Interview
with the Boy Named K."

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:05.221 position:50% align:center
"Boy Hero Saves Lives."

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.682 position:50% align:center
If you still insist that you're
not the legendary detective

00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:10.727 position:50% align:center
I've heard about,
then just what are you?

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.355 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA sighs]

00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:15.648 position:50% align:center
You said you're looking
for someone, right?

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:18.735 position:50% align:center
You'll be the detective
for my case?

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:20.945 position:50% align:center
I'm not really a detective.

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:22.280 position:50% align:center
More of a...

00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:23.823 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Of a what?

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:26.242 position:50% align:center
A sidekick. But all right.

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:28.036 position:50% align:center
What do you mean by that?

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:32.082 position:50% align:center
Tell me. Who is it
you're looking for?

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:35.710 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI grunts]
The thing is... I'm not sure,

00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:37.712 position:50% align:center
and I need your help
to figure out who it is

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:39.381 position:50% align:center
I'm trying to find.

00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:40.840 position:50% align:center
What?

00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:46.429 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
You see, there's somebody

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:49.140 position:50% align:center
I desperately need to meet.

00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:51.643 position:50% align:center
But, uh... I'm not
quite sure who it is,

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:53.603 position:50% align:center
if that makes any sense?

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:55.980 position:50% align:center
For example, I don't have
even the vaguest idea

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:58.733 position:50% align:center
about their age, gender,
or where they live.

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:00.193 position:50% align:center
So, for the time being,

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:03.154 position:50% align:center
let's call the individual
you're looking for "X."

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:06.408 position:50% align:center
What do you know about them?
Any details?

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:08.618 position:50% align:center
Every little thing matters here.

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:11.663 position:50% align:center
Nothing. I don't even
understand why I'm preoccupied

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:14.040 position:50% align:center
with X in the first place.

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:16.501 position:50% align:center
It's just... I have
these sudden urges,

00:06:16.584 --> 00:06:19.170 position:50% align:center
and I find myself
wanting to meet them.

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:22.007 position:50% align:center
When, approximately,
did these urges first start?

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.050 position:50% align:center
One year ago.

00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:27.262 position:50% align:center
Okay, what happened
one year ago?

00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:30.807 position:50% align:center
I was on the verge of death
when I got my life back.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.143 position:50% align:center
No, I was given it.

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:37.105 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI] The heartbeat I had
you listen to in the classroom--

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:39.190 position:50% align:center
It doesn't belong to me.

00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:40.859 position:50% align:center
So, a heart transplant.

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:42.277 position:50% align:center
Go on.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.737 position:50% align:center
I've had a serious
heart condition

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.280 position:50% align:center
ever since I was little.

00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:47.407 position:50% align:center
Growing up, I was
in and out of hospitals,

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.909 position:50% align:center
waiting for a new heart.

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:53.371 position:50% align:center
A year ago, they finally
found a suitable donor,

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:56.875 position:50% align:center
and I was able to undergo
the heart-transplant procedure.

00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.961 position:50% align:center
Ever since that day,
this "X" person's existence

00:07:00.045 --> 00:07:02.422 position:50% align:center
has been fluttering
through my brain.

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:04.424 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Sounds like...

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:06.176 position:50% align:center
...memory transfer.

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:07.635 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Mm?

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:10.221 position:50% align:center
The reason you can't stop
thinking about this person,

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:12.515 position:50% align:center
is that X is someone the
original heart's owner

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:13.516 position:50% align:center
wants to see.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.101 position:50% align:center
Well, that's just stupid.

00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:17.937 position:50% align:center
If you believe that, then why
did you even bother telling me

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:19.481 position:50% align:center
about your heart transplant?

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:20.857 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.901 position:50% align:center
The phenomenon of
memory transference,

00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:25.612 position:50% align:center
it's not scientifically
proven or anything,

00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:28.114 position:50% align:center
but many recipients have
reported feeling influenced

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:30.367 position:50% align:center
by the organ donor somehow.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.786 position:50% align:center
Things like eating food
they used to despise,

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:36.748 position:50% align:center
or having memories of places
that they never visited. Get it?

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:40.251 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I get it. It's not that
I actually want to meet X.

00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:43.254 position:50% align:center
It's what whoever had this heart
before the transplant wanted.

00:07:43.338 --> 00:07:46.966 position:50% align:center
Most likely. If I had to
venture a guess about it all,

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.135 position:50% align:center
I'd say X was
close to the donor.

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:53.098 position:50% align:center
Family. A friend.
Maybe even a lover.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.142 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:58.770 position:50% align:center
All right, I'm glad
we solved that mystery.

00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:01.773 position:50% align:center
Case closed. No need
to thank me for my services.

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:04.234 position:50% align:center
Hey! Where are you going?

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:06.236 position:50% align:center
Since it's solved, I'm leaving.

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:09.030 position:50% align:center
It's not you who wants to meet
X, but the heart's owner.

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:11.408 position:50% align:center
--Well, the original owner.
--[NATSUNAGI growls]

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:12.867 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
It's just an old memory,

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:14.369 position:50% align:center
so it has nothing
to do with you.

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:15.870 position:50% align:center
You're wrong!

00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:19.332 position:50% align:center
It's more than just an old
memory, there's way more to it!

00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:22.043 position:50% align:center
Their body may have died, but
they passed their heart on to me

00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:24.713 position:50% align:center
and I know there's someone
they're desperate to see!

00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:27.799 position:50% align:center
Because of this heart,
I was given a second chance,

00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:29.676 position:50% align:center
and I need to repay the favor.

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:33.138 position:50% align:center
So I'm going to help them--
that's why I have to find X!

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:34.889 position:50% align:center
For your own satisfaction?

00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:37.183 position:50% align:center
Yes, for my own satisfaction.

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:40.061 position:50% align:center
This heart belongs to me now,
and I'll do all it takes

00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:41.438 position:50% align:center
to find this person.

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:43.982 position:50% align:center
Kind of contradicts what
you said before, doesn't it?

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:45.692 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Shut up!

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.947 position:50% align:center
Are you gonna help me or not?

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:53.450 position:50% align:center
That depends--does it pay?

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:26.319 position:50% align:center
"You two"...?

00:16:26.403 --> 00:16:28.363 position:50% align:center
My, such nostalgia.

00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:29.906 position:50% align:center
Yeah, whatever.

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:32.075 position:50% align:center
Listen, there is no way on earth
I'm letting that creepy ear

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:33.993 position:50% align:center
get anywhere close to my heart.

00:16:34.077 --> 00:16:35.870 position:50% align:center
I don't exactly blame you.

00:16:35.954 --> 00:16:39.165 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Actually, this distance
will more than suffice for me

00:16:39.249 --> 00:16:40.917 position:50% align:center
to do the job you want.

00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:43.420 position:50% align:center
But what if I told you that I've
already determined everything

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:45.964 position:50% align:center
there is to know about
your heart, young lady?

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:47.841 position:50% align:center
--[gasps]
--Huh?

00:16:47.924 --> 00:16:50.593 position:50% align:center
No way, then you...

00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:52.470 position:50% align:center
You really have met
the previous owner

00:16:52.554 --> 00:16:54.556 position:50% align:center
of Natsunagi's heart before?

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:57.517 position:50% align:center
An explanation
would be tedious,

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.853 position:50% align:center
so why not just show you?

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.984 position:50% align:center
It can't be...

00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:13.074 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:14.159 --> 00:17:15.952 position:50% align:center
Siesta! Here!

00:17:16.036 --> 00:17:17.996 position:50% align:center
[SIESTA] Simply put, you will
never have the self-agency

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:20.623 position:50% align:center
to raise an appendage
against me ever again.

00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:22.667 position:50% align:center
I was just born to be
an Ace Detective,

00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:24.711 position:50% align:center
it's what's in my blood.

00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:27.839 position:50% align:center
Impossible...

00:17:27.922 --> 00:17:31.634 position:50% align:center
You? No. There's just no way.

00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:34.346 position:50% align:center
Don't do this to me!

00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:35.722 position:50% align:center
It's not fair...

00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:39.184 position:50% align:center
Watson, burying your head
in the sand is pathetic.

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:41.102 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:41.186 --> 00:17:42.937 position:50% align:center
From the moment you two
entered this room,

00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:44.773 position:50% align:center
I was certain it was that
other girl who had come

00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:46.232 position:50% align:center
here with you.

00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:47.901 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:51.071 position:50% align:center
Oh? It's been quite
a long time...

00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:53.490 position:50% align:center
...Ace Detective.

00:17:53.573 --> 00:17:54.991 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA gasps]

00:17:55.075 --> 00:17:57.827 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
So that's what this is about.

00:17:57.911 --> 00:18:00.830 position:50% align:center
I thought it was weird.

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:03.500 position:50% align:center
After all, I was never the type
of girl that went around hugging

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:07.587 position:50% align:center
random guys I'd only
just met or anything.

00:18:07.671 --> 00:18:11.466 position:50% align:center
That behavior was never me.
It was someone else.

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:14.010 position:50% align:center
The previous owner
of this heart.

00:18:14.094 --> 00:18:16.638 position:50% align:center
That ace detective you
used to work with--Siesta.

00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:19.891 position:50% align:center
She was making me
do that stuff all along.

00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:21.559 position:50% align:center
Hold on...

00:18:21.643 --> 00:18:23.311 position:50% align:center
Natsunagi...

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:28.692 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
It's a coincidence.

00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:30.151 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:30.235 --> 00:18:32.696 position:50% align:center
Running into you at school,
and the fact that Siesta's

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:35.323 position:50% align:center
heart just happens
to be there in your chest.

00:18:35.407 --> 00:18:37.534 position:50% align:center
All of it.

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:39.285 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:18:44.249 --> 00:18:47.127 position:50% align:center
And that was the influence of
your heart's former owner.

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:48.336 position:50% align:center
Right, Natsunagi?

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.005 position:50% align:center
It was not!

00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:52.048 position:50% align:center
That was my own intention.

00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:55.260 position:50% align:center
I wanted to hit you in
your stupid face, so I did!

00:18:55.343 --> 00:18:56.928 position:50% align:center
A coincidence?

00:18:57.012 --> 00:18:59.514 position:50% align:center
You call this reunion
a coincidence?!

00:18:59.597 --> 00:19:00.765 position:50% align:center
What a joke!

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:03.435 position:50% align:center
Don't brush this under
the rug with that word!

00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:05.186 position:50% align:center
This is a yearning!

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:09.357 position:50% align:center
Even after dying, this heart
still searched for you!

00:19:09.441 --> 00:19:11.860 position:50% align:center
It still wants to be with you.

00:19:11.943 --> 00:19:14.404 position:50% align:center
That's its only wish.

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:18.366 position:50% align:center
For a long time, we've both...

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.118 position:50% align:center
We've both been searching!

00:19:20.201 --> 00:19:22.287 position:50% align:center
For you, Kimihiko Kimizuka!

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:26.791 position:50% align:center
So shut up! Don't you dare write
this off as a silly coincidence!

00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:30.420 position:50% align:center
Don't make light of this!
This is serious to me!

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:32.422 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA grunts]

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:33.882 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI gasps]

00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:36.384 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA whimpers]

00:19:36.468 --> 00:19:38.345 position:50% align:center
Are you in there...?

00:19:38.428 --> 00:19:40.847 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI gasps]

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:43.433 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Do you know how much I suffered?

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:46.811 position:50% align:center
Everything I went through
after becoming your sidekick.

00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:49.981 position:50% align:center
There was a battle with a
supernatural organization,

00:19:50.065 --> 00:19:51.858 position:50% align:center
and for three years,
we were broke as we

00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:54.361 position:50% align:center
traveled the world
to evade our pursuers.

00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:57.489 position:50% align:center
We slept outdoors in
a freaking hurricane,

00:19:57.572 --> 00:19:59.532 position:50% align:center
and one time, after hitting
it big at the casino,

00:19:59.616 --> 00:20:01.534 position:50% align:center
we stayed in a fancy hotel room.

00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:05.580 position:50% align:center
[sobs] But of course, we were
broke again the next day.

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:08.375 position:50% align:center
We walked through deserts,
traversed jungles,

00:20:08.458 --> 00:20:10.960 position:50% align:center
passed over mountains,
and across oceans.

00:20:11.044 --> 00:20:12.212 position:50% align:center
And then...

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.089 position:50% align:center
And then...

00:20:15.423 --> 00:20:18.093 position:50% align:center
How could you go
and die before I did...?

00:20:18.176 --> 00:20:19.886 position:50% align:center
You idiot!

00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:21.429 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI gasps]

00:20:34.943 --> 00:20:37.821 position:50% align:center
[FUUBI]
I'm glad you found some answers.

00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:40.281 position:50% align:center
Send me a thank you
card in the mail.

00:20:40.365 --> 00:20:41.574 position:50% align:center
Ms. Fuubi.

00:20:41.658 --> 00:20:43.993 position:50% align:center
You knew from
the beginning, didn't you?

00:20:44.077 --> 00:20:45.912 position:50% align:center
[FUUBI]
Huh?

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:47.497 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Don't play dumb.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:52.002 position:50% align:center
You knew about her heart,
and who it once belonged to.

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:53.294 position:50% align:center
[FUUBI]
Mm.

00:20:53.378 --> 00:20:54.921 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Ms. Fuubi.

00:21:00.385 --> 00:21:04.264 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] C'mon, I'd never
ask her to do detective work.

00:21:04.347 --> 00:21:06.433 position:50% align:center
I'm not cruel, y'know.

00:21:14.274 --> 00:21:16.609 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Hey. Thanks for today.

00:21:17.527 --> 00:21:19.237 position:50% align:center
It's because of you--

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.865 position:50% align:center
Ugh, what am I trying to say?

00:21:21.948 --> 00:21:25.410 position:50% align:center
I couldn't stay how I was.
You helped me see that.

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:27.871 position:50% align:center
I think I understand.

00:21:27.954 --> 00:21:29.372 position:50% align:center
And maybe...

00:21:31.583 --> 00:21:32.959 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA sighs]

00:21:34.294 --> 00:21:35.795 position:50% align:center
--[KIMIZUKA] Natsunagi.
--[NATSUNAGI] Hmm?

00:21:35.879 --> 00:21:40.592 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Listen. No matter who
that heart used to belong to...

00:21:40.675 --> 00:21:42.344 position:50% align:center
...you should live
your own life now,

00:21:42.427 --> 00:21:44.596 position:50% align:center
'cause that's what it's for.

00:21:44.679 --> 00:21:46.681 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:46.765 --> 00:21:50.393 position:50% align:center
You don't need to try
to replace anybody, okay?

00:21:50.477 --> 00:21:51.644 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI whimpers]

00:21:52.979 --> 00:21:54.814 position:50% align:center
--[KIMIZUKA] See ya.

Kimizuka, Hold on, I--

00:22:02.113 --> 00:22:03.656 position:50% align:center
What's that? Did you--?

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.911 position:50% align:center
Uh, hello! I, uh...

00:22:07.994 --> 00:22:09.788 position:50% align:center

Hmm?

00:22:09.871 --> 00:22:11.331 position:50% align:center
You've gotta help me!

I have a job for
an Ace Detective!
