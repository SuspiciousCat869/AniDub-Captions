00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:15.640 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI] Kimizuka had
given me a whole new life.

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:19.144 position:50% align:center
I had taken on the role of
a legendary detective.

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:21.855 position:50% align:center
But I wasn't solving
ordinary crimes.

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:25.358 position:50% align:center
I was fighting against
android criminals.

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:27.444 position:50% align:center
The very first night
after I made the choice

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:31.322 position:50% align:center
to change my whole identity,
to become a legendary detective,

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:34.617 position:50% align:center
I had a fascinating dream.

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:38.371 position:50% align:center
It was about my predecessor,
the true legendary detective

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:42.250 position:50% align:center
who had solved crimes and fought
criminals all over the world.

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:45.587 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
She was very different than me.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.505 position:50% align:center
I'd go so far as to
say that Siesta and I

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:50.300 position:50% align:center
had opposite personalities.

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:53.720 position:50% align:center
She, the intellectual one,
and I, the intuitive one,

00:00:53.803 --> 00:00:56.348 position:50% align:center
had a dramatic
argument in the dream.

00:00:56.431 --> 00:01:00.060 position:50% align:center
It was an unsightly scene,
a clichÃ© melodrama.

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:03.730 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI] Ultimately,
I won the argument, though.

00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:05.357 position:50% align:center
No, that's not true.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.318 position:50% align:center
It's more accurate to say
Siesta was the bigger person

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.111 position:50% align:center
and ceded the fight to me.

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:12.989 position:50% align:center
She's more mature that way.

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:21.831 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI] So, in the end,
Siesta said she would leave

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:25.168 position:50% align:center
the responsibility for
Kimizuka to me.

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.879 position:50% align:center
Thus, I inherited the title
of legendary detective

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:31.591 position:50% align:center
and all that came with it.
I was someone at last.

00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:34.678 position:50% align:center
Or, to look at it
a different way...

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:37.347 position:50% align:center
To fail at this job
would be unacceptable.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.100 position:50% align:center
No one likes a nobody,
and I never want to go back

00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:41.726 position:50% align:center
to that place.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.812 position:50% align:center
It was a cage.

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:47.899 position:50% align:center
That darkness was... too much.

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:58.201 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] One week after
Saikawa's live stadium show,

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:00.995 position:50% align:center
school let out for
summer vacation.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.081 position:50% align:center
It was the perfect chance to
follow through on promises

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:05.750 position:50% align:center
I'd made to Natsunagi
and Saikawa.

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:08.420 position:50% align:center
I figured we would just go to
a local beach or something,

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:10.880 position:50% align:center
but nope, not so much.

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:12.173 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA]
We're off!

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:15.427 position:50% align:center
Officially on course!
For the Aegean Sea!

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.722 position:50% align:center
Hip, hip, hooray!

00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:23.184 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
You're always so over the top!

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.231 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Hey, Saikawa.

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.525 position:50% align:center
When we said, "Let's check
out the ocean together,"

00:02:30.608 --> 00:02:33.862 position:50% align:center
I was thinking more "beach day"
and less "8-day ocean voyage."

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:34.988 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA]
Well, we've left port,

00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:37.032 position:50% align:center
so you might as well
stop complaining.

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:38.700 position:50% align:center
Get into vacation mode!

00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:40.201 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
She's absolutely right.

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:44.664 position:50% align:center
Nobody likes a party pooper,
especially on vacation!

00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:46.750 position:50% align:center
This is my first
ocean voyage, too,

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:49.586 position:50% align:center
and I'm so looking forward
to the experience.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.171 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot, Yui.

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:52.922 position:50% align:center
It's really not a big deal.

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:56.009 position:50% align:center
It's the least I can do
to repay you for your help.

00:02:56.092 --> 00:02:59.054 position:50% align:center
Another way would be fighting
alongside us against SPES.

00:02:59.137 --> 00:03:01.890 position:50% align:center
If you do that,
then we can call it even.

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:03.391 position:50% align:center
Of course--happy to help.

00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:06.561 position:50% align:center
You know I'll do
anything within my power.

00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:11.649 position:50% align:center
Well, hopefully, we won't really
need it, but just in case...

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.151 position:50% align:center

Kimizuka?

It's been, what, a year?

00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:22.077 position:50% align:center
Aout that.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.162 position:50% align:center
Since that sad day.

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:27.707 position:50% align:center
Kimizuka, who is
this pretty girl?

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:33.505 position:50% align:center
Char. She used to be my--our
associate back in the day.

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:36.383 position:50% align:center
To be honest, I never
expected to see you again.

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:38.635 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm a bit
surprised, myself.

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:40.303 position:50% align:center
Have you been doing well?

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:42.055 position:50% align:center
[CHAR]
If I had to venture a guess,

00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:45.016 position:50% align:center
I'd say you being onboard
this ship is just a coincidence.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.936 position:50% align:center
Why, is there
something going on here?

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.188 position:50% align:center
Seriously? What in
the world have you been

00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:52.315 position:50% align:center
doing all this time?

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.609 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:57.278 position:50% align:center
[CHAR] What have you been
doing since Mom died?

00:03:57.362 --> 00:04:00.198 position:50% align:center
Kimizuka, I thought that your
intention was to pick up

00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:02.659 position:50% align:center
right where she left
off in her work.

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:06.037 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
You mean her dying wish?

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:08.665 position:50% align:center
I've taken on that task.

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:10.208 position:50% align:center
Who are you?

00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:13.962 position:50% align:center
I am the Legendary Detective,
Nagisa Natsunagi.

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:16.214 position:50% align:center
Natsunagi, you say?

00:04:16.297 --> 00:04:19.175 position:50% align:center
Oh. You're the one who...

00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:23.179 position:50% align:center
[CHAR] Could you go play
cops-n-robbers somewhere else?

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:25.682 position:50% align:center
I don't have time for all
of your childish games.

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.142 position:50% align:center
You're making a mockery of her.

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:28.810 position:50% align:center
I'm not playing any games!

[gasps]

00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:31.771 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI] Don't you think
there has to be a reason

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:34.482 position:50% align:center
she gave me a second chance
at life in this way?

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:37.235 position:50% align:center
She entrusted her heart
to me to fulfill a purpose.

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:39.779 position:50% align:center
I meant it when I said
I took on her dying wish.

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:42.574 position:50% align:center
I swear by the heart
in my chest!

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:44.909 position:50% align:center

Hmm. Fine, then.

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:47.037 position:50% align:center
You may do whatever you want.

Know this.

00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:57.047 position:50% align:center

[NATSUNAGI grunts]

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:02.719 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA]
Sorry. It's my fault.

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:04.679 position:50% align:center
If I hadn't invited
you two on this cruise,

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:07.515 position:50% align:center
you wouldn't have gotten
swept up into this drama.

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.893 position:50% align:center
There's no need
to apologize, Saikawa.

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.644 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who
should say sorry.

This isn't a game to me!

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:28.078 position:50% align:center
She has no idea
what I've been through.

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:32.415 position:50% align:center
How 'bout a dip in the pool
to lighten the mood?

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:33.750 position:50% align:center
Eh, Saikawa?

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:36.670 position:50% align:center
Right! And there's even
a waterslide, Nagisa!

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:37.879 position:50% align:center
Come on! You'll love it!

00:05:37.962 --> 00:05:39.506 position:50% align:center
Let's go get those

Ah! Hold on, Yui! Stop!

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:44.386 position:50% align:center
Now, then...

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:57.482 position:50% align:center
That makes it 17 losses

00:05:57.565 --> 00:06:00.860 position:50% align:center
[growls] This joint is
definitely run by the mob.

[CHAR grunts]
What the hell?!

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:10.912 position:50% align:center
Only gambling addicts keep

What do you want?

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:18.461 position:50% align:center
I assume you were looking
for me for a reason, right?

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:21.673 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Earlier, you implied
that there was something

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:23.341 position:50% align:center
happening on the ship?

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:26.011 position:50% align:center
[CHAR sighs]

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:28.179 position:50% align:center
Mom's bequest.

00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:29.764 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Her bequest?

00:06:29.848 --> 00:06:35.103 position:50% align:center
Yes, shortly before she passed
away, Mom left behind bequests

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:37.897 position:50% align:center
that would help us
defeat SPES globally.

00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:40.275 position:50% align:center
And one of those objects
can supposedly be found

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:42.068 position:50% align:center
on this ship.

00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:45.780 position:50% align:center
It took time to figure it out,
but my intel is correct.

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:48.491 position:50% align:center
A bequest from Siesta
is on this ship...

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:51.911 position:50% align:center
So how's the casino connected?

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:53.371 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh...

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:55.206 position:50% align:center
I thought something worthy
of being a bequest from Mom

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.624 position:50% align:center
would most likely
be in the casino--

00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:58.001 position:50% align:center
a special jackpot
or something.

00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:00.920 position:50% align:center
I figured if I won
it big, maybe...

[gasps]

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:05.633 position:50% align:center
Wow. You really are
a proper idiot, huh?

00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:07.469 position:50% align:center
What?! How dare you!

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:09.346 position:50% align:center
Well, since you have
no desire to help take on

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:13.475 position:50% align:center
Mom's dying wishes, none of this
has much to do with you anyway.

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:17.937 position:50% align:center
Sorry to worry you,
it wasn't my intention.

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:20.398 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:22.817 position:50% align:center
So why didn't you
become a detective?

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:25.403 position:50% align:center
I was for sure you'd
take up that mantle.

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:32.160 position:50% align:center
Something she--Siesta--said to
me on that day, four years ago.

00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:36.164 position:50% align:center
Be my sidekick for
this case will you?

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:40.126 position:50% align:center
So I wouldn't feel right
being a detective.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.505 position:50% align:center
For the foreseeable future,
I'll remain what I was.

00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:45.757 position:50% align:center
The legendary
detective's sidekick.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.551 position:50% align:center
I'll still be that, for her.

You're a fool.

00:07:51.763 --> 00:07:54.140 position:50% align:center
You're the one living
in the past for Mom.

00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:56.643 position:50% align:center
I'm honoring her
by moving forward.

00:07:57.727 --> 00:07:59.437 position:50% align:center
[CHAR]
Oh, well--it's fine.

00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:01.064 position:50% align:center
I'll handle things
in my own way--

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:03.608 position:50% align:center
I don't really need your help.

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:08.113 position:50% align:center
But you're free to find Mom's
bequest--and your own answers.

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:11.282 position:50% align:center
You can do it in your own way.

00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:22.544 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA, NATSUNAGI laughing]

00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:28.925 position:50% align:center
Huh. I guess it's good
that they're cutting loose

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:31.720 position:50% align:center
while they still can.

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:34.514 position:50% align:center
[PASSENGERS murmuring]

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:47.736 position:50% align:center
Well.

00:08:52.824 --> 00:08:56.619 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] After all that,
I didn't come across any leads.

00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:58.496 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Something's weird here.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.415 position:50% align:center
What do you mean, "weird"?

00:09:00.498 --> 00:09:02.125 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI] Sitting face-to-face
with you like this

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:04.419 position:50% align:center
and eating a nice, fancy dinner.

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:05.920 position:50% align:center
What else can we do?

00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:09.007 position:50% align:center
Saikawa said she's making
the rounds as a guest of honor.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.550 position:50% align:center
So you think I'm boring?

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:13.553 position:50% align:center
Will you please stop
putting words in my mouth?

00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:16.681 position:50% align:center
Kimizuka, when we were
at the pool today,

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:18.850 position:50% align:center
you didn't join us.
What did you do?

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:20.060 position:50% align:center
Nothing much.

00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:22.812 position:50% align:center
After I went and bought
a sexy new swimsuit...

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:23.813 position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:26.274 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI sighs]
Nothing.

00:09:26.358 --> 00:09:28.985 position:50% align:center
Natsunagi, what are
you doing after?

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:31.237 position:50% align:center
Huh? I dunno, what's up?

00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:33.698 position:50% align:center
Well, um, there's a little
something that I wanted

00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:35.241 position:50% align:center
to discuss with you.

00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:37.285 position:50% align:center
What is it? Is there
some reason we can't

00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:38.912 position:50% align:center
just talk about it now?

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:40.330 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Yeah.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:43.249 position:50% align:center
It's something that'd be a bit
awkward to discuss here.

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:45.460 position:50% align:center
But the bar across
the way should be fine.

00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:48.421 position:50% align:center
You wanna meet me there in
an hour or so and talk about it?

00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:50.965 position:50% align:center
You mean... just you and me?

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:53.218 position:50% align:center
The two of us, alone in a bar?

00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:54.552 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Yeah, exactly.

00:09:54.636 --> 00:09:58.598 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI groans]
Okay then, I guess that's fine.

00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:11.236 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Been waiting long?

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:20.203 position:50% align:center
You didn't have to
change for me.

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:22.080 position:50% align:center
What? Oh, I didn't.

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:24.207 position:50% align:center
I just had to take a shower, and
I realized I literally had

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.751 position:50% align:center
nothing else to wear
except for this!

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:31.006 position:50% align:center
So what did you wanna discuss?

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:36.553 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI] That was not
the discussion I expected.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:39.597 position:50% align:center
I figured he wou--
I feel ridiculous.

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:43.226 position:50% align:center
It must've been the influence
of my heart's former owner.

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:45.437 position:50% align:center
What're you muttering
under your breath over there?

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.273 position:50% align:center
Uh... Huh? What's that?

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:49.941 position:50% align:center
Why are you flipping out now?

00:10:50.025 --> 00:10:51.192 position:50% align:center
I'm not flipping out.

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:52.277 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
You are flipping out.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.362 position:50% align:center
I said I'm not flipping out!

00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:55.697 position:50% align:center
This is flipping out!

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.657 position:50% align:center
[yelps]
You're a child.

00:10:57.741 --> 00:10:59.200 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
But, anyway...

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:02.495 position:50% align:center
She's not as bad of a person
as I thought, that Char girl.

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:05.707 position:50% align:center
She's a pure and simple fool,
which might be the best thing

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.959 position:50% align:center
about her now
that I think about it.

00:11:08.043 --> 00:11:11.254 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI] Hmm.
I knew it all along you know.

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:15.467 position:50% align:center
That between you and me,
I was the stronger one.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.803 position:50% align:center
I didn't even know Siesta like
you--I just have her heart.

00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:20.472 position:50% align:center
And I still got it in
my head that I should

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:23.224 position:50% align:center
fulfill her dying wish.

00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:24.893 position:50% align:center
That's what I don't understand.

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:27.729 position:50% align:center
Why did you decide
to take up her mantle?

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:31.608 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Because, from a young age,

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:33.651 position:50% align:center
my body was a total wreck.

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:36.905 position:50% align:center
That sickroom was like my
birdcage, and I was convinced

00:11:36.988 --> 00:11:39.783 position:50% align:center
that I would spend
my entire life in there.

00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:43.703 position:50% align:center
How could my existence
ever mean anything at all

00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:45.747 position:50% align:center
if I never left that room?

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.416 position:50% align:center
That terrified me, haunted me.

00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:51.044 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
But then, by some miracle,

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:52.796 position:50% align:center
I was given another chance.

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:56.216 position:50% align:center
A chance to fly free--
to truly live.

00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:57.509 position:50% align:center
And yet...

00:11:58.385 --> 00:12:01.763 position:50% align:center
I didn't know how to,
you know, fly away.

00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:03.431 position:50% align:center
How to fly?

00:12:03.515 --> 00:12:05.433 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI sighs]
And so, I decided

00:12:05.517 --> 00:12:07.227 position:50% align:center
I would just cheat a little.

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:11.439 position:50% align:center
I would live her life--the girl
who'd given me my freedom.

00:12:11.523 --> 00:12:14.317 position:50% align:center
That's what I thought.

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:15.735 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
It's all so sad.

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:18.029 position:50% align:center
Natsunagi didn't know
how to live her own life,

00:12:18.113 --> 00:12:20.907 position:50% align:center
so she decided to live
Siesta's instead.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.827 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I did the same.

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:26.830 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Well, then.

00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:29.874 position:50% align:center
I guess I'm gonna
head up to bed now.

00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.334 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Okay.

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:46.433 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA snoring]

00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:50.311 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 10A] This is an

Hey, what's this announcement?

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:53.648 position:50% align:center
Where's that voice coming from?

00:12:53.732 --> 00:12:55.442 position:50% align:center
[CREWMEMBER 10B] There wasn't
anyone in the radio room.

00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:56.443 position:50% align:center
What's going on?

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:58.236 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA groans]

00:12:58.319 --> 00:12:59.863 position:50% align:center
What's happening...?

00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:02.699 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 10A] A girl is
currently being held hostage.

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:04.743 position:50% align:center
She is in the lounge area.

00:13:04.826 --> 00:13:07.620 position:50% align:center
The girl's name
is Nagisa Natsunagi.

[KIMIZUKA gasps]

00:13:12.584 --> 00:13:13.626 position:50% align:center
Saikawa?

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.211 position:50% align:center
Are you hearing that voice?

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:18.006 position:50% align:center
I just checked Nagisa's room,
but she's nowhere to be found.

00:13:18.089 --> 00:13:19.758 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:26.389 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA] So... is that bequest
of Siesta's related to

00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:28.641 position:50% align:center
Nagisa's disappearance somehow?

00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:32.270 position:50% align:center
Well, we certainly can't
rule out the possibility.

00:13:32.354 --> 00:13:33.730 position:50% align:center
[CREWMEMBER 10C] We've finished
a sweep for explosives.

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:34.898 position:50% align:center
[CREWMEMBER 10D]
All right, once more.

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:36.358 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA]
Any sign of Natsunagi?

00:13:36.441 --> 00:13:38.443 position:50% align:center
[CREWMEMBER 10A]
Ms. Saikawa.

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:41.071 position:50% align:center
No, not in the lounge
or anywhere else.

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:43.490 position:50% align:center
However, we did find this.

00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:49.412 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Kimizuka, this is...

00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:50.872 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:53.917 position:50% align:center
"At 8 PM, bring the
legendary detective's bequest

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.503 position:50% align:center
and come to the main deck"

[sighs]

00:13:57.754 --> 00:13:59.839 position:50% align:center
Do you think SPES
could be behind this?

00:13:59.923 --> 00:14:01.716 position:50% align:center
If it's the legendary
detective's bequest

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.967 position:50% align:center
they're after,

00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:05.553 position:50% align:center
then that's sufficient
circumstantial evidence.

00:14:05.637 --> 00:14:08.014 position:50% align:center
But unfortunately, we don't
know what the bequest is,

00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:10.850 position:50% align:center
so we don't know what
we're looking for.

00:14:10.934 --> 00:14:12.811 position:50% align:center
Then in that case...

00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:18.900 position:50% align:center
Let's just focus on finding
Natsunagi and forget about

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:21.111 position:50% align:center
Siesta's bequest for now.

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:37.877 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA sighs]

00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:42.132 position:50% align:center
Nothing here either?

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:43.591 position:50% align:center
Damn it...

00:14:43.675 --> 00:14:45.719 position:50% align:center
And I've been using
my left eye, too,

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:48.513 position:50% align:center
so there shouldn't be
anything I'm overlooking.

00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:51.016 position:50% align:center
Right. Well, this sucks.

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:52.434 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA whimpers]

00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:56.730 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA]
Give me your hand.

00:14:56.813 --> 00:14:57.981 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:58.064 --> 00:15:02.527 position:50% align:center
Roll your shoulders back
and breathe in rhythm.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.238 position:50% align:center
Close your eyes,
inhale deeply...

00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:07.407 position:50% align:center
[inhales]

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.034 position:50% align:center
...and let it out.

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:11.786 position:50% align:center
Open your eyes, and your field
of vision, which was clouded,

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.538 position:50% align:center
will now be clear.

00:15:14.873 --> 00:15:16.374 position:50% align:center
So what is all that?

00:15:16.458 --> 00:15:19.127 position:50% align:center
It's kind of an incantation--
something to calm my heart

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:20.754 position:50% align:center
when it feels like
it might burst.

00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:23.256 position:50% align:center
Like, before a live performance.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.883 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.262 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for worrying you.

00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:30.889 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty pathetic.

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:33.767 position:50% align:center
You're not pathetic.
Not even a little.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:37.145 position:50% align:center
You don't think so?
I lost my cool, though.

00:15:37.228 --> 00:15:40.523 position:50% align:center
[giggles] That's a ridiculous
thing to say.

00:15:40.607 --> 00:15:42.567 position:50% align:center
It presupposes that I ever
thought you were cool

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.445 position:50% align:center
in the first place, Kimizuka,
and I did not!

00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:47.072 position:50% align:center
All right, Saikawa.

00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:49.866 position:50% align:center
Stone cold, just throwing
disses like nothing, huh?

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:52.660 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on, I wasn't
trying to be mean.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.041 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA] We have more in common
than you think, you know.

00:15:58.124 --> 00:15:59.501 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
In what way?

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:02.212 position:50% align:center
I used to be just like you,
Kimizuka.

00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:06.383 position:50% align:center
I was one of those people
who can't live life alone.

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:07.759 position:50% align:center
But when my parents died,

00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:10.595 position:50% align:center
I lost sight of any reference
points for living.

00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:14.349 position:50% align:center
I obsessed about all the broken
promises, and, as a result

00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:16.685 position:50% align:center
of all that, I attempted
to commit an act

00:16:16.768 --> 00:16:19.187 position:50% align:center
that could never be undone.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.439 position:50% align:center
Saikawa...

00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:23.817 position:50% align:center
But then two people came
along and saved me--

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.403 position:50% align:center
One of them was you,
Kimizuka, and I could just tell

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:28.571 position:50% align:center
that you were in the same
boat that I was.

00:16:28.655 --> 00:16:30.824 position:50% align:center
And the other one was Nagisa.

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:33.368 position:50% align:center
The two of you caring enough
to try and save me

00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:36.204 position:50% align:center
gave me the courage
to keep going.

00:16:36.287 --> 00:16:38.707 position:50% align:center
Which is why I was able to
take the hand you offered me

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.167 position:50% align:center
without hesitation.

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:43.878 position:50% align:center
Make sense? You gave
me the best gift,

00:16:43.962 --> 00:16:46.965 position:50% align:center
so I don't expect you to do
anything over and above that.

00:16:47.048 --> 00:16:49.551 position:50% align:center
That said, my request is that
you don't worry about me

00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:52.971 position:50% align:center
any more than is necessary,
do you understand?

00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:55.306 position:50% align:center
That's the kind of partners you
and I will be to each other,

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.308 position:50% align:center
and that's all right.

00:16:57.392 --> 00:16:59.310 position:50% align:center
Makes sense.
Works for me.

00:16:59.394 --> 00:17:01.104 position:50% align:center
It keeps it simple.

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:04.399 position:50% align:center
If you call yourself the
legendary detective's sidekick,

00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:06.943 position:50% align:center
then that would make me like the
sidekick to the sidekick,

00:17:07.027 --> 00:17:08.028 position:50% align:center
wouldn't it?

00:17:08.111 --> 00:17:10.280 position:50% align:center
So you wanna be
a sidekick's sidekick?

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:11.865 position:50% align:center
Yeah, exactly right!

00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:14.993 position:50% align:center
Hey, this arrangement reminds me
of those Russian nesting dolls.

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:16.619 position:50% align:center
I don't know if I could
ever really become

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:19.247 position:50% align:center
your true right hand,
but I do think I could be

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.499 position:50% align:center
something like your left eye?

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:24.502 position:50% align:center
Okay, that would be ideal.

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:30.759 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
After all that, we still haven't

00:17:30.842 --> 00:17:32.844 position:50% align:center
even found a single clue.

00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:34.262 position:50% align:center
But Kimizuka--

00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:37.349 position:50% align:center
That said, what we did find
is that we weren't able

00:17:37.432 --> 00:17:38.683 position:50% align:center
to find anything.

00:17:38.767 --> 00:17:40.101 position:50% align:center
[SAIKAWA]
Mm-hmm.

00:17:40.185 --> 00:17:41.770 position:50% align:center
If our enemy can't
be found even when

00:17:41.853 --> 00:17:44.105 position:50% align:center
you're using your left eye...

00:17:44.189 --> 00:17:46.316 position:50% align:center
You having a "Eureka" moment?

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:48.777 position:50% align:center
Yeah. From here on out,
we aren't going to bother

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.863 position:50% align:center
with deduction or tactics.

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:55.158 position:50% align:center
I'm done with games,
this is war.

00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:04.042 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA grunts]

00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:07.796 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] I've had about
enough of the cat and mouse.

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:11.841 position:50% align:center
Come on out, Chameleon!
Show yourself!

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:14.219 position:50% align:center
And return Natsunagi.

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:17.889 position:50% align:center
You were smart
to know I was here.

00:18:21.226 --> 00:18:22.852 position:50% align:center
[CHAMELEON chuckles]

00:18:24.646 --> 00:18:25.563 position:50% align:center
Natsunagi!

00:18:25.647 --> 00:18:27.357 position:50% align:center
[CHAMELEON]
Easy, now.

00:18:29.192 --> 00:18:32.737 position:50% align:center
I would appreciate it
if you'd hold still for me.

00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:36.616 position:50% align:center
[growls] Just what is it
that you're after?

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:40.453 position:50% align:center
I believe you already know
exactly what it is I'm after.

00:18:40.537 --> 00:18:42.038 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, we'd be
thrilled to hand over

00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:44.874 position:50% align:center
that infamous "bequest,"
but unfortunately for all of us,

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:47.168 position:50% align:center
we don't know a thing about it.

00:18:47.252 --> 00:18:49.879 position:50% align:center
Why don't you just be
civil and let her go?

00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:52.340 position:50% align:center
This is becoming
a bit of a problem.

00:18:52.424 --> 00:18:54.175 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:58.096 position:50% align:center
[CHAMELEON] I honestly expected
you to be better at bargaining.

00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:01.307 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA gasps]
Stop this, Chameleon!

00:19:06.021 --> 00:19:07.230 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI grunts]

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:08.356 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA growls]

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.817 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Kimi... zuka...

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.569 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
Natsunagi!

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:15.113 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI groaning]

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:16.656 position:50% align:center
[chuckles weakly]

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.743 position:50% align:center
I seem to have screwed things up
pretty badly on this one...

00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:21.036 position:50% align:center
Sorry...

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:22.537 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA gasps]

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:27.417 position:50% align:center
Let's make a deal.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.129 position:50% align:center
Will you save this girl's life?
Or will it be the lives

00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:34.883 position:50% align:center
of the passengers they're now
desperately trying to evacuate?

00:19:34.966 --> 00:19:36.468 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA growls]

00:19:36.551 --> 00:19:39.679 position:50% align:center
You shall have the honor of
making this impossible choice!

00:19:39.763 --> 00:19:42.599 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] So, tell me, what is
the point in doing that?

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:45.560 position:50% align:center
[CHAMELEON] Oh, just the
frosting on the proverbial cake.

00:19:45.643 --> 00:19:47.354 position:50% align:center
What's the cake, then?

00:19:47.437 --> 00:19:50.148 position:50% align:center
[CHAMELEON] Well, if the
legendary detective's bequest

00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:54.944 position:50% align:center
can't be found, then this
entire ship will sink.

00:19:55.028 --> 00:19:56.571 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA]
But why Natsunagi?

00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:57.906 position:50% align:center
Why kill her?

00:19:57.989 --> 00:20:00.450 position:50% align:center
What would you creeps
gain by doing that?

00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:03.453 position:50% align:center
The answer is actually
remarkably simple.

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:05.705 position:50% align:center
You see, this girl's body
has been imbued with

00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:07.832 position:50% align:center
the legendary detective's blood.

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:09.209 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA growls]

00:20:09.292 --> 00:20:11.961 position:50% align:center
Now, it's time
for you to choose.

00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:17.717 position:50% align:center
Will you save this damsel's
life, or everyone else's?

00:20:17.801 --> 00:20:19.594 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA growls]

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.137 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Kimizuka...

00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:22.472 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA gasps]

00:20:25.934 --> 00:20:28.520 position:50% align:center
I want you to shoot me.

00:20:28.603 --> 00:20:31.189 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?
Don't be absurd.

00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:33.441 position:50% align:center
It's an easy choice.

00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:35.318 position:50% align:center
One life taken
to save the many--

00:20:35.402 --> 00:20:37.904 position:50% align:center
Shoot me and save
all the passengers.

00:20:37.987 --> 00:20:42.242 position:50% align:center
That kind of dispassionate
thinking--it's unlike you.

00:20:42.325 --> 00:20:43.993 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Is it?

00:20:44.077 --> 00:20:45.745 position:50% align:center
Maybe so...

00:20:45.829 --> 00:20:49.374 position:50% align:center
But still, this situation calls
for a legendary detective's

00:20:49.457 --> 00:20:53.962 position:50% align:center
cool, calculated reasoning,
not my passionate emotions.

00:20:54.045 --> 00:20:56.423 position:50% align:center
But you're the
legendary detective!

00:20:56.506 --> 00:20:57.966 position:50% align:center
No, I'm not.

00:20:58.049 --> 00:21:00.301 position:50% align:center
I am not anything at all.

00:21:00.385 --> 00:21:01.761 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA gasps]

00:21:01.845 --> 00:21:03.471 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI]
Kimizuka...

00:21:03.555 --> 00:21:06.433 position:50% align:center
When you said I didn't
need to replace anyone,

00:21:06.516 --> 00:21:08.852 position:50% align:center
I deeply appreciated that.

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:10.645 position:50% align:center
You have no idea.

00:21:12.689 --> 00:21:14.274 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much!

00:21:15.942 --> 00:21:17.485 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:21.573 --> 00:21:25.493 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA growls]
Keep your calculated reasoning.

00:21:25.577 --> 00:21:26.786 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.205 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] You say you're
not anything at all?

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.168 position:50% align:center
Well, if you're not anything
at all, you should be free

00:21:33.251 --> 00:21:36.004 position:50% align:center
to become anything you want.

00:21:36.087 --> 00:21:38.673 position:50% align:center
If you don't know how to fly,
someone who does

00:21:38.757 --> 00:21:41.926 position:50% align:center
can teach you to
spread your wings.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:44.054 position:50% align:center
If you don't know
how to live your life,

00:21:44.137 --> 00:21:47.474 position:50% align:center
you can follow in
someone else's footsteps!

00:21:47.557 --> 00:21:49.184 position:50% align:center
[NATSUNAGI gasps]

00:21:50.977 --> 00:21:53.897 position:50% align:center
[CHAMELEON] Enough talk.
Have you arrived at a decision?

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.942 position:50% align:center
[KIMIZUKA] Yeah. I made
my decision a long time ago.

00:22:02.364 --> 00:22:03.323 position:50% align:center
[CHAMELEON gasps]

00:22:03.406 --> 00:22:05.408 position:50% align:center
'Cause we have an arrangement.

00:22:05.492 --> 00:22:09.454 position:50% align:center
Nagisa Natsunagi
can't die before I do.

00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:12.957 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but that's
what was promised.
