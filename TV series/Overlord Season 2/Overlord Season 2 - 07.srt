[AINS] First up, the

Next, is the reconstruction

and equipment fund for
the Lizard Men villages.

[MOMONGA]
Dammit all.

7
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,875
Why is there never enough money?

8
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:37,416
Maybe I should find a merchant
with deep pockets to sponsor me.

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,916
No. Momon is highly respected.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,333
I can't have people thinking
he's only in it for the money.

11
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:47,416
Still. I really need the cash.

00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:54,375
Do you have news?

15
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,958
Yes, Mr. Momon, sir.

16
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,916
[AINS]
She's still doing that.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,833
It's become a verbal
tic at this point.

18
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:05,000
[AINS]
What is it?

19
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,541
Forgive my intrusion,
but I thought

20
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:08,541
you would like to know
the iron ore you requested

21
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:11,208
has arrived and the merchant
is waiting for payment.

22
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:12,333
[AINS]
Excellent.

23
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:14,625
Take this and thank him for me.

24
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:21,708
May I ask why you ordered it
from so many different sources?

25
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:23,500
[AINS]
It's an experiment.

26
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,083
I'm learning how
the Exchange Box

27
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:27,250
appraises things in this world.

28
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:28,916
Understood, sir.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,333
Then I will retrieve
the ore and report back.

30
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:32,458
[AINS]
Good.

31
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:34,458
And if the situation
should turn ugly,

32
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:36,125
how will you handle it?

33
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,583
Safety takes priority.

34
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:40,666
I will withdraw immediately.
Once I'm clear.

35
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,333
I will relocate to
the dummy Nazarick,

36
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,916
that Lady Aura constructed,
with all due haste.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,708
And, in doing so,
confuse our enemies.

38
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:50,291
[AINS] Good. Avoid routes
with large crowds

39
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,208
where you can
easily be attacked.

40
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,875
And should any bystanders
accost or cat-call you,

41
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,916
do not injure them severely.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,625
Keep your bloodlust in check,

43
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:01,625
and refrain from calling
humans "worms" or "insects."

44
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:04,458
Remember, we are
high-ranking adventurers.

Both our reputations
hinge on your restraint.

Right.

Yes, you're right, of course.

If you really took
stock in my advice,

to waste my breath

I'm terribly sorry, sir.

Since you won't rest,
how about a practice match?

With you, sir?

Just recently,

00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,458
I was shown how
callow I truly am.

66
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:41,500
I'd like to train with someone
who has a little resilience.

Callow? You, Lord? No way.

68
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,375
Yup.

69
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:48,875
If not for the aid of a merciful
and awe-inspiring caster,

70
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,083
there's a good chance

71
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,125
I wouldn't be standing
here right now.

72
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,875
What sort of magic
caster could do that?

73
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,166
His name is Ains Ooal Gown.

74
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,500
He is incredible.

75
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,000
Even the Baharuth Empire's
freakish wizard

76

wouldn't stand a chance.

77
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,833
At least, that's what
I think of him.

78
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,458
I'll be sure to remember him.

You can count on that, my lord.

But are... you sure
you wanna train

with someone as
inexperienced as me?

82
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:19,125
It's not training.
Just practicing with swords.

it or not is entirely up to you.

But that formal training
is holding you back.

means of attacking.

00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,541
by the fact that he's an
orphan from God knows where.

164
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:45,791
The Noble Faction's antipathy
toward him is pretty strong.

165
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,791
So, do you think you
can help him improve?

166
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:52,666
Sadly, he's as strong
as he's ever going to be.

167
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,166
He's what adventurers would
call "capped at gold."

168
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,125
But while he's limited
by his ability,

169
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:02,916
he's not limited by experience.
Only time will tell.

170
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,250
Hold on.

171
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:08,666
Gazef, is that Prince Zanac
with Marquis Raeven?

172
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,458
Why would someone
of the Noble Faction

173
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,708
be with the Prince?

174
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,666
Does he intend to switch
to the Royal Faction?

175
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,833
Very possible--

176
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,500
that Marquis is a
shameless opportunist.

177
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,791
Wouldn't shock me
to see him anywhere.

178
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,500
Who knows what he's
working behind the scenes.

179
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,000
[gasps]

180
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,958
Ah, the ever-dutiful Climb.

181
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:44,208
On your way to visit
that monster, I presume?

182
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,250
I am.

183
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,041
With all due respect, Highness,

184
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,833
Princess Renner is a kindhearted

185
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,083
and beautiful treasure
of the kingdom.

186
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,958
I'm not the one who
called her a monster,

187
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,458
and I will deny anyone
who says otherwise.

188
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,375
[gasps]

189
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,541
But a "beautiful
treasure," well,

190
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,000
considering the money
she's wasted on commoners

191
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,166
and the prohibition
of transit-tariffs.

192
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,708
I hardly think "treasure"
is appropriate.

193
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,000
Highness.

194
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,791
I believe Princess Renner
proposed the measure

195
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,875
that abolished the slave
trade within the kingdom.

196
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,208
Surely that has merit.

197
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,833
A rare exception, that.

198
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,291
But what about
the others, Marquis?

199
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,875
She knows her goal
is impossible,

200
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:21,208
so she throws darts in the dark
with no regard to who she hits.

201
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm certain she wouldn't
do such a thing, Lord.

202
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,375
I'm sure you are.

203
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,875
Would you deliver a message
to that monster for me?

204
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,791
If given the chance,
our elder brother

205
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,833
will use her as a
political instrument,

206
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,583
but if she works with me,
he will graciously relieve her

207
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,791
of her title as Princess
and grant her a comfortable

208
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,750
plot of land out
in the frontier.

209
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,333
[gasps] Surely you jest, Lord.

210
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,625
I'll pretend I didn't
hear that, for your sake.

211
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,750
What a shame. I thought
it was quite good.

212
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,333
[ZANAC]
One more thing.

213
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,416
Marquis Raeven and I
are of the same mind

214
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,041
when it comes to that
girl and her "policies."

215
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,541
I dare say our joining
forces will prove to be

216
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,291
the last nail in Renner's
proverbial coffin.

217
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,666
Prince Zanac.

218
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,333
Don't worry about it, Marquis.

219
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,833
I'm fairly certain that
monster is quite aware

220
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,791
of our opinion of her.

221
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,833
[MAID 7A] Goodness, what's
a commoner doing in here?

222
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,000
[MAID 7B]
The princess has bizarre tastes.

223
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,291
[MAID 7A]
Definitely.

224
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
[sighs]

225
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,250
[CLIMB]
Pardon me.

226
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,541
I was wondering where you were.

227
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,791
Morning, Princess.

228
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:37,166
Sorry I'm late. Lady Aindra.

229
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,750
Uh.

230
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:42,041
Oh, her. She's a
member of my team.

231
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,500
[RENNER]
This is Tina.

232
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,291
My apologies. It's a
pleasure to meet you.

233
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,000
My name is Climb.

234
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,916
I'm well aware
of your exploits--

235
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,958
of all Blue Rose's
members, in fact.

236
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,083
You're practically
living legends.

237
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,416
[TINA]
Pleasure.

238
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,250
Thanks for looking after
my fiendish boss' friend.

239
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,208
We were just getting to
the meat of the discussion.

240
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,500
Why don't you join us?

241
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,375
I'm your bodyguard.
It would be inappropriate.

242
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,250
[LAKYUS]
It makes no difference to me.

243
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,750
My lady. I couldn't possibly.

244
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:12,916
Enough with formality.
Just call me Lakyus.

245
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,125
Special men get that privilege.

246
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,250
"Special"?

247
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,875
Please don't joke
like that, my lady.

248
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,666
Wait, she was joking?

249
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,083
'Course I was, sweetie.

250
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,916
I mean, Climb is special,
don't get me wrong,

251
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,666
but it's because he's your man.
I was just having fun.

252
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,166
You're incorrigible.

253
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,958
Now, sit down and drink
before your tea gets cold.

254
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,916
Don't worry, Tina's
the only one who bites.

255
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,166
[RENNER] Now, back to
what we were discussing.

256
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,166
About Eight Fingers, right?

257
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,500
Where'd we leave off?

258
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,458
I'm pretty sure I covered
how we burned the fields

259
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:46,291
they used for producing
Black Dust materials.

260
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,750
Yes.

261
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,291
On that note, I can't thank
you and Blue Rose enough.

262
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,875
My brother and the
nobles do nothing

263
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,208
but quarrel among themselves.

264
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,416
If they keep allowing
Eight Fingers to secretly

265
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,458
do business in the
kingdom's shadows,

266
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,000
it will fall into ruin.

267
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,833
Our nation will crumble
from the inside out.

268
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:03,875
However,

269
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,291
I don't have any
influential backing

270
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:09,208
or a military force
at my discretion.

271
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,291
I'm sorry.

272
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,750
It's just, since
Eight Fingers has ties

273
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,458
to the noble and royal factions,

274
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:17,208
I must put the burden on
adventurer's like Blue Rose.

275
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,791
No need for apologies.
We're friends, after all.

276
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,208
Tina, give her the parchment.

277
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,041
[LAKYUS] We found this in
the village where they were

278
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:31,708
producing Black Dust.
Know what it is?

279
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,583
It's a substitution cipher.

280
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,208
[BOTH gasp]

281
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,666
Interesting.

282
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,291
I wonder why they
left it behind?

283
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:42,125
A trap? Or for
some other reason?

284
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:46,291
And if it was a trap,
why use something so hard?

285
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,416
Be right back.

286
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,916
I have a hunch that
cracking this code

287
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,625
will prove fairly easy.

288
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:51,875
Unbelievable.

289
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,166
You got that right.

290
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,500
I don't understand
why she thinks

291
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,458
she's powerless to help anyone.

292
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,416
Of all the people I know,
she's the only one

293
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,208
I would call a genius
and mean it.

294
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,708
Well, it isn't orders from
their higher ups, sadly.

295
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:10,500
But it is a list of
villages and buildings.

296
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,750
Seven of which
are in the capital.

297
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,541
Do you think they're
Black Dust stockpiles

298
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:18,000
or other critical
production sites?

299
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,958
I doubt they'd leave
anything that important

300
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:23,625
at a production site or
written in such an easy code.

301
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,666
I think... it was bait.

302
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,041
[BOTH]
They tricked us?

303
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,583
[RENNER] Not exactly.
Eight Fingers is divided up

304
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,416
into eight different
organizations, right?

305
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,250
Yeah, that's the rumor, anyway.

306
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,958
There's smuggling,
slave trading, gambling,

307
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,166
illegal drugs and each
one has its own chief.

308
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,916
Then I believe these are bases
for the other organizations.

309
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,791
They need our
attention diverted

310
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,791
until they can get
things back on track.

311
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:50,125
And they're using their
own partners as bait?

312
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,916
That underground brothel's
not on the list.

313
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,041
[LAKYUS]
What is it?

314
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,333
I'm confused.

315
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,041
I thought that
such establishments

316
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,541
had been done away with
thanks to the princess.

317
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:02,791
Mostly.

318
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,291
Abolishing the slave trade
did a lot of good.

319
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,916
But, unfortunately,
one Eight Fingers brothel

320
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,708
is still active
here in the capital.

321
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,333
Tell me, Renner,
what would you say

322
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,791
to Blue Rose raiding the place
and putting an end to it

323
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,208
once and for all?

324
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,208
If it turned up some
evidence as a result,

325
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,416
it would strike a powerful
blow against the nobles

326
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,458
who are in bed
with Eight Fingers.

327
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,958
I appreciate your willingness,
but I would hate

328
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,416
to create trouble for
you and your family.

329
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,166
On the other hand,
it would be too much

330
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,708
for Climb to handle alone.

331
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,500
I'm terribly sorry for my
lack of strength, Princess.

332
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,500
Forgive me, Climb,
that was careless!

333
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,375
That isn't what I was
implying at all, okay?

334
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,791
I rely on you more
than anyone, Climb.

335
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,083
I can't begin to thank you
for how hard you work,

336
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,083
even when you don't
think I'm looking.

337
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,875
Just, please, don't do
anything too foolhardy.

338
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,625
In fact, I order you not to.

339
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,416
You see, if anything
happened to you, I'd...

340
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,750
I would...

341
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:58,625
[clears throat]

342
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,208
In any case, while we
can't ignore the brothel,

343
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,791
we should discuss the other
locations on this paper

344
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:06,375
and what to do about them
before they catch on.

345
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,375
You're right. We should take
advantage of the opportunity.

346
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,458
They still haven't
realized we're responsible

347
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,000
for the village attack.

348
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,875
However, they have got to
know that this information

349
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,250
has been leaked by now.

350
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,333
Is it okay if we borrow
Climb for a little while?

351
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,166
I'd like him to tell
Gagaran and the others

352
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,000
that we're making
our move right away.

353
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,958
Understood, Lady Aindra!

354
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,166
[LAKYUS muffled] Come to think
of it, Tina's investigation

355
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,916
turned up the names
of several nobles...

356
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,458
My, my.

357
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,291
Sounds like the Princess is
doing something reckless again.

358
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,166
Must be tough on those
Blue Rose ladies.

359
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,583
I'm afraid that one of
those nobleman's daughters

360
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,000
is currently serving
me as a maid.

361
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,375
Well, it doesn't
seem likely that

362
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,333
she was sent here just
to spy on you, but still.

363
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,833
Yes, I know.

364
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:53,083
I'll have to tell Climb to be
extra careful from now on.

365
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:03,583
Welcome back, my lord.
I've been waiting.

366
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,291
That's very thoughtful of you.

367
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,833
I trust there were no
problems with your work?

368
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,333
[TUARE]
No, none.

369
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:12,666
Well done, Tuare.
I'm glad to hear it.

370
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,250
Have you decided what we're
having for dinner tonight?

371
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,458
A stew, Lord.

372
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,250
Made with chopped potatoes.

373
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,333
If it proves to be as tasty
as your previous dishes,

374
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,500
I'm looking forward to it.

375
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,625
You don't mean that.

376
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,958
I wouldn't lie to you, Tuare.

377
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:31,125
Are you sure you have all
the ingredients for the dish?

378
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:34,250
No. Sorry, I'll
check on it later.

379
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,041
We can go shopping
together if you like.

380
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,833
[TUARE]
No, that's all right.

381
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,916
Do not worry.
I understand your fear.

382
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,250
I'm not angry.

383
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,916
You must be terrified
of going outside.

384
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
But, please, rest assured.

385
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,875
I made a promise to
protect you, Tuare.

386
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,500
No matter what perils
may come your way.

387
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:01,666
I will dash them to pieces.
You have my word.

388
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,583
Tuare, keep moving forward.

389
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:08,333
If you're scared, I don't mind
if you close your eyes to do it.

390
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:13,291
All I ask is you trust
me to lead the way.

391
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,375
Lord Sebas, you
aren't being fair.

392
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,875
You aren't.

393
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:21,666
There is no way I could possibly
say no to you after that.

394
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,458
And don't worry about me.

395
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:26,541
I may not look it but
I'm strong, I assure you.

396
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,041
As a matter of fact,

397
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:31,166
there are only 41 others
who are stronger than me.

398
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,666
At least, they're the
only ones I'm aware of.

399
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,583
Is that a lot? Forty-one?

400
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:38,958
[chuckles]

401
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,125
[knocking]

402
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:45,708
I've returned and am at
your service, my lady.

403
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,208
Very good. Thank you, Sebas.

404
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,416
Are you certain we should not
inform Lord Ains about her?

405
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,041
I imagine he requires you
to be in daily contact with him.

406
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,083
Could you not simply make
mention of that woman

407
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,916
the next time you report in?

408
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,250
First off, I have an
extremely high regard

409
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,875
for her culinary abilities,
Solution. Secondly,

410
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,375
if any humans were
to see us living alone

411
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,500
in this mansion,
it might raise suspicion

412
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,833
and spur them to
scrutinize our presence.

413
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,583
So, she's part of
a diversionary tactic?

414
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,500
[SEBAS] Yes and if I
were to seek permission

415
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,375
from Lord Ains over
a matter as simple

416
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,916
as maintaining our cover,
he's likely to snap

417
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,750
and tell me to think for myself.

418
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,708
[STAFFAN] I am Staffan Havish,
a constable charged

419
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,458
with keeping the peace here
in our glorious capital.

420
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,541
What can I do
for you, Constable?

421
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,083
[STAFFAN]
There's an establishment, well,

422
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,083
his establishment, actually.

423
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,625
Call me Succulent.

424
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,583
A pleasure to meet you, my lady.

425
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,750
I received a disturbing report
from an eyewitness recently.

426
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,583
Apparently, someone with
a scroll bearing the seal

427
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,125
of the magicians' guild,
gave him an exorbitant

428
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:00,625
amount of money and made off
with one of his employees.

429
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,166
Sounds like a clear violation

430
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,625
of our slave trade
prohibition. So, my lady.

431
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,666
Has someone in your house
been especially naughty?

432
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,041
This is boring.

433
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,166
[STAFFAN]
Huh?

434
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,125
[SOLUTION]
I will let my butler, Sebas,

435
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,166
deal with this touchy matter.

436
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,291
I'm sure he can handle
things from here.

437
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,958
Good day, gentlemen.

438
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,333
Now then, as my
lady has ordered.

439
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,083
I will listen to
what you have to say

440
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:27,333
and take whatever
action is necessary.

441
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,708
[STAFFAN] Well, from the
circumstantial evidence alone,

442
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,916
it is beyond a doubt that
you have committed a crime.

443
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,791
Fortunately for you
and your mistress,

444
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,541
he's a benevolent man and is
willing to offer you clemency

445
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,416
which will, naturally,
take the form of consolation

446
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,125
payments and commissions.

447
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,750
[SEBAS] I see. And how
much will that cost?

448
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,375
Five hundred gold.
Not a copper less.

449
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,833
That is beyond extortionate.

450
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,958
The girl was in a terrible
state when I found her.

451
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,458
If you were to
take her away now,

452
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,500
she might very well die from it.

453
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,500
You don't say. How tragic.

454
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,125
In the interest of my
dear employee's welfare,

455
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:04,250
what would you say to loaning us
the lady of your house, instead?

456
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,916
While the girl recovers.

457
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,958
Oh, indeed!

458
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,166
Your lost income
must be compensated!

459
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,916
Your excessive lust must
be a problem for you.

460
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,291
Ah! How dare you! Lust has
nothing to do with it!

461
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,625
I am merely upholding the law

462
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,541
that came at the noble
behest of the eminent

463
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,791
Golden Princess Renner!

464
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,083
I will not stand here
and suffer your insults!

465
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,416
Now, now, there's no reason

466
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,750
to let your blood
boil, Lord Havish.

467
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,083
We'll return the day after
tomorrow for your decision.

468
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:31,708
I hope, for your sake,
it's the right one, Sebas.

469
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,041
We'll see, won't we?

470
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,458
May I ask what you plan to do?

471
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:45,625
[SEBAS] I think I'll go for a
short stroll and think it over.

472
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,583
[SOLUTION]
Message.

473
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,666
Hello? Lord Ains?
Can you hear me?

00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,750
[AINS]
Solution?

00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:01,333
I'm surprised to
have you contact me.

476
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:02,791
Is something wrong?

477
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,166
I think...

478
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,666
...there's a chance that
Lord Sebas has turned on us.

479
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,708
[AINS]
Mm... U-Uh, really?

480
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:12,041
[AINS clears throat]
No kidding around.

481
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,333
If you don't have proof
of this accusation,

482
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,750
punishment will be swift.

483
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,166
Is there any?

484
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,750
Yes, Lord.

485
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,666
[AINS] In search of the
strength to protect his master,

486
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,875
Climb puts forth
relentless effort.

487
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:59,166
In the eyes of those
stronger than he,

488
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:02,625
Climb has no potential
physically or with magic.

489
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:06,458
Knowing this, Climb presses on,
until eventually,

490
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:11,500
his search for strength brings
him to meet a powerful old man.

491
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:16,500
Chapter 8: "A boy's feeling".


492
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:19,958
If you wish for strength,
show your resolve.
