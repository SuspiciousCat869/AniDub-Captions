I am Evileye of Blue Rose!

00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:26,333
We should form a party.

00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:30,791
Two adamantite adventurers

found its way into the city.

00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,791
[EVILEYE]
Huh?

165
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,208
[AINS]
Good. You weren't hurt.

166
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,291
[EVILEYE]
Uh... Yeah.

167
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:39,458
[EVILEYE gasps] On your
shoulder! Are you all right?

168
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:45,083
[AINS] Something this
minor is no issue.

169
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,708
Don't worry about me.

170
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,583
I'm just glad you're safe.

171
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,000
[EVILEYE]
Uh...

172
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,583
[EVILEYE chuckles nervously]

173
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:52,875
[DEMIURGE]
Bravo!

174
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,875
I'm honestly shocked
you could keep her alive.

175
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,916
It's not often I feel the
need to praise my opponent.

176
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,208
Well done.

177
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,125
[AINS]
You talk too much.

178
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,541
[EVILEYE gasps]
My Lord Momon!

179
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,750
[EVILEYE]
Forgive me, bards of the world!

180
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,833
Knights really do fight
to defend their maidens!

181
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,375
I should have never doubted you!

182
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,833
[EVILEYE] I feel more like
baggage than a princess.

183
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,000
Knock it off!

184
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,666
This isn't the time
for silly daydreams!

185
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,333
[DEMIURGE] Well. I believe
I'll be on my way.

186
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,791
[EVILEYE]
Huh?

187
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,583
[DEMIURGE] I must find the
item by any means necessary.

188
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:34,166
A circle of hell fire will soon
cover a section of the city.

189
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,041
Should you foolishly
choose to enter,

190
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:40,250
I promise you a slow and painful
journey into the afterlife.

191
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,875
Farewell.

192
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,916
[EVILEYE]
Huh? He's getting away!

193
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,833
We have to stop him.

194
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,000
[AINS]
We can't.

195
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,250
If we go after him,
he'll start fighting

196
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:53,875
like he really means it,
and if that happens...

197
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:58,708
[EVILEYE] Oh. Still protecting
me. You truly are gallant.

198
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:02,500
[MOMONGA] Great, what am
I going to do now?

199
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:09,000
[EVILEYE] After that, we managed
to drive the insect maid

200
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,375
right down to the ground.

201
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,166
[AINS]
Is that right?

202
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,583
[EVILEYE]
Huh?

203
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,458
[AINS]
Did you kill her?

204
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,916
[EVILEYE]
No, unfortunately.

205
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,416
Jaldabaoth made sure
that didn't happen.

206
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,750
[AINS]
I see.

207
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,083
Don't be hard on yours--

208
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,625
[NARBERAL growling]

209
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,208
[AINS]
Uh--

210
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:34,083
[AINS clears throat]
So, it could be that

211
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:37,250
Jaldabaoth only attacked you
to defend the insect maid.

212
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,625
Would you say
that's a possibility?

213
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:44,166
[EVILEYE] I'd say we tugged on
the tiger's tail, and got bit.

214
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,416
[EVILEYE]
But, you heard what he said.

215
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,750
Trapping part of the
city in hellfire?

216
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,916
No way that's just retaliation.

217
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,041
He would have done it even if
his servant wasn't attacked.

218
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,125
My friends were right
to challenge her.

219
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,875
I'm sure any of us would
have done the same.

220
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,291
[AINS] U-Uh. Of course,
without question.

221
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,833
I did not intend to blame
them for their fate.

222
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,166
I beg your pardon.

223
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,208
[EVILEYE]
Oh! No, no, please.

224
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,375
Lift your head.

225
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,916
A man as handsome
as you shouldn't be--

226
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,500
[EVILEYE squeals]

227
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,041
[EVILEYE]
Handsome? What am I saying?

228
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,250
I just can't help
myself around him.

229
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,583
It's been a few hundred years
since my last crush,

230
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,666
but there's nothing wrong
with that, is there?

231
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,041
Of course not!

232
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,458
He's everything I like,
and stronger to boot!

233
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,791
[AINS]
Miss Evileye?

234
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,291
[EVILEYE]
Ah! Yes! Hi. Lord Momon.

235
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,541
[AINS] I need to fill
Nabe in on a few things.

236
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,916
Excuse me a moment.

237
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,166
[EVILEYE]
Oh.

238
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,708
[AINS] She won't be
able to hear us here.

239
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,000
Nonetheless, we should
still be cautious

240
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:50,083
while we're around her.

241
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,208
Now then, Narberal.

242
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,500
[AINS]
I can pretty well guess

243
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,958
what Demiurge's
plan is, overall.

244
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,500
However, the more
precise a machine is,

245
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,458
the easier it is to disrupt.

246
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:05,083
One slip up could throw
a wrench into the gears.

247
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,208
We must prevent the
slightest misunderstanding

248
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:10,125
from knocking us
back to square one.

249
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,791
Do you get what I'm saying?

250
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,333
Indeed, I do.

251
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,875
I expected no less
from you, Lord.

252
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:19,000
[AINS]
I have everything well in hand.

253
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,375
[MOMONGA]
Who am I kidding?

254
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,250
The only reason I'm out here
is because some noble

255
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:25,500
named Raeven made a special
request of the guild.

256
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,416
We had to ride on
a Floating Board.

257
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,583
I felt like luggage
the whole time,

258
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:33,041
but the reward was
exceptional, so we managed.

259
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,958
And, once I saw
the disturbances,

260
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,375
I thought "Wait!

261
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,541
This is Momon's first big
fight in the capital city!

262
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,583
I gotta make a badass entrance!"

263
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:41,916
So I jumped.

264
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,875
[MOMONGA sighs] How did
things turn out this way?

265
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,000
[AINS]
Hm?

266
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:52,708
[AINS] Now, I need you to
get in touch with Demiurge.

267
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:56,666
I'd do it myself, but I can't
cast spells in this form.

268
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:01,625
Besides. If she saw me,
it would complicate things.

269
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:05,166
Hm... Is she staring?

270
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,666
She must have her
doubts about me.

271
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,416
Perhaps, but I don't
think that's the case.

272
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,291
Behind that mask of hers,

273
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:16,333
I think you'd find eyes filled
with lust and sparkles.

274
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,875
[AINS]
Let's not wax poetic.

275
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,250
I can read her thoughts
like the back of my hand.

276
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,375
There's no attraction.

277
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,125
Getting upset when
she spoke of Entoma

278
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,750
may have compromised us,
if only a little.

279
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,500
[gasps] I should have
expected as much.

280
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,041
Forgive me, Lord Ains.

281
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:34,250
Truly, your vision befits one
who sits upon the throne.

282
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,250
[AINS] Please, enough
with the flattery.

283
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:40,750
It was an obvious consideration
that arose from my own slip up.

284
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,500
Let's get the ball
rolling, Narberal.

285
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,583
Lord. Send Message.

286
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,958
[MOMONGA] Well, that should
keep my reputation as leader

287
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:57,541
from falling apart,
at least. Now then...

288
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,791
[MOMONGA] You know, it's hard
to believe that a little child

289
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,958
like her possesses
adamantite class strength.

290
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,791
[AINS]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

291
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,625
Would you like me to
help you carry them?

292
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:14,708
[EVILEYE]
No need.

293
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:17,083
My friends should
be along shortly.

294
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,625
It's possible we'll
be able to cast

295
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,750
resurrection magic on them here.

296
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,583
I'd rather not move them.

297
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,291
[AINS]
Hm. You have a party member

298
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:27,333
who can cast resurrection magic?

299
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:28,916
[EVILEYE]
Uh, that's right.

300
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,916
Our team leader, Lakyus,
can invoke Raise Dead.

301
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,125
It's a fifth-tier spell.
Impressive, I guess.

302
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,500
[AINS]
And, your friends.

303
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:40,958
Will they be able to engage
in combat soon after?

304
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,125
[EVILEYE]
Mm-mm. I'm afraid not.

305
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,208
This magic costs a huge
amount of life force

306
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:48,250
at the time of resurrection.
Quite a toll.

307
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,291
[AINS]
I see.

308
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,666
[EVILEYE] As such, they won't
be able to move around

309
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,791
on their own for
a while afterwards.

310
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,583
I wouldn't even suggest it
for someone weaker than them.

311
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:00,083
They'd be reduced to ashes.

312
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,916
[AINS]
Unfortunate.

313
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,958
If you wouldn't mind,
could we wait here with you?

314
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,666
I would like to meet
this leader of yours.

315
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,041
Lady Lakyus.

316
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:11,208
[EVILEYE gasps]
Why do you want to meet, Lakyus?

317
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:14,083
[MOMONGA] Sure enough.
She's got her guard up.

318
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:17,416
[AINS] I would simply like
to meet the leader of Blue Rose.

319
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,708
She's a fellow adventurer,
and my senior in experience.

320
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,166
Is there some reason
why I shouldn't?

321
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,500
[EVILEYE]
No, no! No problem.

322
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,000
Not in the slightest.

323
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:30,750
[NARBERAL] Momon, sir! I think
you will want to see this.

324
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,625
[EVILEYE gasps]

325
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,916
[CLIMB] What will you do
after this, Lord Sebas?

326
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,083
I'll be taking Tuare
to a safe location.

327
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,666
I won't let this happen
to her ever again.

328
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,958
I understand.

329
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,625
Just so you know,
everything you've done

330
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,416
means the world to us.

331
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,666
Please, think nothing of it.

332
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,291
You have helped me keep
my promise to Tuare.

333
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,458
I will repay you, someday.

334
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,416
[CLIMB gasps]

335
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,916
Tell me I'm not the
only one seeing this.

336
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,333
[EVILEYE]
What is that?

337
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,541
[AINS]
The flames of Gehenna?

338
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,250
Good and brave adventurers.

339
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,708
Thank you for coming
together so quickly.

340
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,291
We face a dire crisis.

341
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,833
[ADVENTURERS gasp]

342
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,041
[RENNER]
Early this morning,

343
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:22,000
a wall of flame sprang
up around this area.

344
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,791
Cutting off a section
of the city.

345
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,500
However, these flames
are similar to an illusion,

346
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,833
and seem to cause
no harm upon contact.

347
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,916
Miss Lakyus, leader of
the famous Blue Rose,

348
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,875
confirmed this for us.

349
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,208
[LAKYUS]
I touched it with my own hand.

350
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,125
It didn't feel hot to the touch,

351
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:44,791
and I passed clear to the
other side without any issue.

352
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,458
However, there appears
to be a horde

353
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,250
of low-level demons
infesting the area.

354
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,041
The ringleader has identified
himself as Jaldabaoth.

355
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,875
He's an extremely fiendish
and powerful demon,

356
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:02,583
and many evil creatures of
power are serving under him.

357
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,583
How strong are we talking?

358
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,500
Two of the members of Blue Rose,

359
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:10,375
the warrior Gagaran, and the
thief Tia, were killed.

360
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,458
[EVILEYE] And he did it
with just one blow.

361
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:13,958
[ADVENTURERS gasp, murmur]

362
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,291
[EVILEYE]
Calm yourselves!

363
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:19,166
Yes, Jaldabaoth's
strength is immense.

364
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,583
I confronted him myself
and was powerless

365
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,458
against his might.

366
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:26,875
But we have someone
even stronger!

367
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,000
[EVILEYE]
The Raven Black Hero, Momon!

368
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,666
[ADVENTURERS gasp]

369
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,375
Fear not.

370
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,083
I know it seems hopeless,

371
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:40,541
but I wouldn't do this unless
I thought we could win.

372
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:44,125
I've devised a plan of attack
that I believe will succeed...

373
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,916
[RENNER] Lastly, we'll
need a detached force

374
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,666
of adventurers to rescue the
civilians currently trapped

375
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,458
within the flame wall.

376
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:04,000
If the demons are, indeed,
holding them captive,

377
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:07,500
they're probably using one
of the warehouse districts.

378
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,291
And have likely
split up families

379
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,166
to discourage dissent.

380
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:20,000
You'll go. Won't you, Climb?

381
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:23,666
Without hesitation.
Even if I die trying.

382
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:29,125
[BRAIN] Princess, would it
be okay if I tag along?

383
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,500
[RENNER]
You would be most welcome,

384
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,291
Lord Brain Unglaus.

385
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,791
[ADVENTURERS murmur]

386
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,333
Count me in. Sounds fun.

387
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,916
Thanks, everyone.

388
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,166
I shall remain here,
and pray to the gods

389
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,416
that every one of you
returns to us safely.

390
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,541
May the light shine upon you.

391
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:47,708
Happy hunting!

392
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:51,833
[ADVENTURERS cheer]

393
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:56,583
[ADVENTURERS]
Long live the Golden Princess!

394
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:57,916
[GAZEF]
Climb.

395
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,166
[GAZEF]
Take this with you.

396
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,583
What is it?

397
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,333
Looks like a magic item.

398
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:05,416
It is.

399
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,208
That ring can
transcend human bounds,

400
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:11,375
and push your strength
well past your limits.

401
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,708
[CLIMB]
Past my limits?

402
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,333
I can't possible accept
such a precious item!

403
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:17,541
You can.

404
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:20,958
The woman I got it from
trusts my judgment.

405
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,125
Bring it back to me.

406
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,250
[gasps]

407
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,000
[BRAIN]
We all have to come back.

408
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:29,125
For Princess Renner's sake.

409
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:32,458
[CLIMB]
Right!

410
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,083
[ZANAC] So you'll form a line
using the adventurers,

411
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,125
and back them up with the
guardsman in an effort

412
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:48,375
to thin out the
enemy's formation.

413
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:52,166
Heh. At that point,
the Raven Black Hero Momon,

414
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:56,208
and the Lady Nabe, along with
Lady Evileye of Blue Rose,

415
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:59,458
will break through the center
like a spear through fodder.

416
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:00,541
--Nice.
--[RAEVEN] But,

417
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:03,916
isn't Climb's mission
a bit too risky?

418
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,041
[RENNER] He'll be making
rounds inside the capital

419
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,916
along with your soldiers.

420
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,708
It's no different
than his usual duties.

421
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:15,625
[RENNER]
Yes, Climb may end up dying.

422
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:17,125
Then, my dear friend, Lakyus,

423
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:20,041
will cast her resurrection
magic on him.

424
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,000
And when his life force
has been weakened

425
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,041
by such a potent spell.

426
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:28,500
I will personally take
him into my tender care.

427
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:30,458
Since it was my order
that got him killed

428
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:33,583
to begin with, no one
would dare object.

429
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:36,250
I would only be
doing what's right.

430
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,666
So that's your game.

431
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:41,208
I suppose this was your plan
all along, dear sister?

432
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,750
[RENNER]
Yes.

433
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,333
[BOTH gasp]

434
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:52,125
[AINS] A part of the
royal capital has been

435
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:54,083
sectioned off by
a wall of flame,

436
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:57,625
turning the area within it
into a demon-filled hell.

437
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:59,541
The humans prepare
to fight back.

438
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:03,333
Both soldiers and adventurers
unite against the monsters.

439
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:06,916
The task of defeating the demon
Jaldabaoth is left to Momon,

440
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,500
Nabe, and Evileye. A symbol
of hope for mankind,

441
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,083
Momon turns his
blade to the demon.

442
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:17,750
Chapter Thirteen:
"The Ultimate Trump Card."


443
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,083
I have everything well in hand.
