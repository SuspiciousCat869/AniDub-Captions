00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,791
[TINA, GAZEF, TIA, GAGARAN]
Yes, ma'am!

163
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,000
[EVILEYE]
Shard Buckshot!

164
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,750
[YURI yells]

165
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,125
[EVILEYE]
Not again!

166
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:02,875
[YURI yells]

167
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,208
[EVILEYE grunts]

168
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,250
[CZ] Not that you need it,
but, I'll cover you.

169
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,666
[EVILEYE]
Sand Field All!

170
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,333
[EVILEYE]
Damn.

171
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,166
Monsters aren't supposed
to team up like this.

172
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,666
It isn't fair!

173
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,541
[EVILEYE gasps]
What the...?

174
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,916
Crystal Wall!

175
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,666
[YURI yells]

176
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,291
[YURI yells]

177
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,916
[EVILEYE]
Fa jin?

178
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,166
Impressive.

179
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,166
I've never met anything immune
to negative energy before.

180
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,916
You must have every
resistance there is.

181
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,791
Looks like Lord Momon
is still in the fight.

182
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:04,125
In that case, I'll buy him
as much time as I can.

183
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,625
[AINS]
You're sure this room is secure?

184
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,833
[DEMIURGE]
I've seen to it.

185
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:29,083
There's no one who can listen in
on our conversation, my lord.

186
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,083
[AINS]
All right.

187
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,916
Tell me everything
about your plan.

188
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,750
Of course, but first,
allow me to thank you

189
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,416
for indulging me, my lord.

190
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,875
I'm rather eager to share
the results of my design.

191
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,291
Overall, there are four
merits to the series

192
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,291
of plans I have devised.

193
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,291
[MOMONGA]
Four? I don't know a single one!

194
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,916
[AINS] Hm. Here I thought
there were three.

195
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,083
I think this may be the
first time I've bested you

196
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,958
in a contest of wits, Lord!

197
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,583
[AINS] Oh, you always
have the better of me.

198
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,666
You are too modest.
I'm flattered.

199
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,125
[AINS]
No, really.

200
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,708
Now, why don't you tell
me about these merits?

201
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,166
Right.

202
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,166
The first one is that we are
claiming all the materials

203
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,000
within the surrounding
storehouses.

204
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,500
[AINS]
Hm.

205
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,083
[MOMONGA]
Fantastic!

206
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,833
Now we don't have to worry about
being low on funds for a while.

207
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,333
Secondly, this incident
allows us to cover

208
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,958
our attack on Eight Fingers,
as you instructed us to do.

209
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,000
[AINS] Now that you mention it,
you said your goal

210
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,333
was to recover a powerful item?

211
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,250
[DEMIURGE]
See for yourself.

212
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:36,416
The magic within is
called "Armageddon Evil."

213
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,875
Tenth Tier magic.
Almost "god" level.

214
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:43,416
[AINS] As I recall,
it summons a horde of demons.

215
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,000
My creator, Lord Ulbert,
also crafted this item.

216
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,666
Shall we use it here?

217
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,875
[AINS] I have one better.
I think you'll like it.

218
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,375
[AINS] It's Ulbert's
prototype of the same item.

219
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,125
It should work, all the same.

220
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,208
You may use it
for your purposes.

221
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,541
Lord.

222
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,833
I couldn't possibly use
such a personal treasure.

223
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:04,958
[AINS]
Oh?

224
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,083
Then I shall gift
it to you, Demiurge.

225
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,250
Though,

226
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,458
Ulbert might be
embarrassed that I've kept

227
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,041
his failed creation
around for so long.

228
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,625
Do with it as you see fit.

229
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,458
Such an honor.

230
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,041
[DEMIURGE]
I'm most grateful.

231
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,750
[AINS]
Stop that. Really.

232
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,333
Consider it thanks for
your fierce loyalty.

233
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,208
The Great Ones created us.

234
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:29,666
It is only right we are loyal,
and that we continuously

235
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,833
demonstrate it until
we meet our end.

236
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,166
Nonetheless, for to
once again address me,

237
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,875
a servant, with such charity,

238
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,583
and to reward me with
such a precious gift...

239
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,416
I can only repay you
by humbly offering

240
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,875
an even deeper
devotion to your will.

241
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:49,583
[AINS grunts] I look forward
to it. Now, continue.

242
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,958
I wish to know the
rest of your plan.

243
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,500
With that narrative in place,

244
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,750
Jaldabaoth has attacked
the Eight Fingers bases

245
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,000
looking for this item.

246
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,791
Which just happened
to give him control

247
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,875
of the capital's
warehouse district.

248
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,666
And of course,
this item will be "found"

249
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,958
in the warehouse that serves

250
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,708
as Eight Fingers'
base of operations.

251
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,125
[AINS]
Obviously. Tell me the merit.

252
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,375
Right.

253
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,541
We have captured all the
humans that were trapped

254
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,583
within the wall of the flame.

255
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,166
The majority of them are already
being taken to Nazarick,

256
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,250
where I think they could be
put to all kinds of uses.

257
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:25,666
[AINS] Regardless of their
age or gender, I'm assuming?

258
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,291
[DEMIURGE]
Of course.

259
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,333
[MOMONGA] Ever since I
ended up in this body,

260
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:32,458
I haven't felt a sense of
affinity for the human race.

261
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:33,833
Not a single death or suffering

262
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,791
we've inflicted has
pained my heart.

263
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,500
If it benefitted Nazarick,
I didn't care.

264
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,750
But, even so.

265
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,166
[AINS]
Listen carefully.

266
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,291
See that those who haven't
dishonored the Great Tomb

267
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,875
or myself are given
painless deaths.

268
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,541
Only the guilty shall suffer.

269
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,541
How benevolent, my lord.

270
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,000
It shall be as you wish.

271
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,083
[AINS]
Back on topic.

272
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:58,041
You still have one more
merit to reveal.

273
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,041
Yes, Lord.

274
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,500
When everything
is said and done,

275
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,833
all the city's woes will be
laid at Jaldabaoth's feet.

276
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,166
[AINS] In other words,
you're establishing yourself

277
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,666
as a notorious demon.

278
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,916
[MOMONGA]
He's using this to increase

279
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,375
Momon's reputation. Nice.

280
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,875
[AINS]
That makes sense. I'm convinced.

281
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,541
So, is there something
in particular

282
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,666
you need me to help with?

283
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,833
All you have to do is
drive me out of the city,

284
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,541
and there should be
no problem, Lord.

285
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,458
I will do everything in my power
to serve you as your foil.

286
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:29,833
And I promise to put on one
hell of a show in the process.

287
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,583
[LUPISREGINA]
Wow, that little girl

288
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,583
has some serious moves.

289
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,083
What'd she say her name was?

290
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,625
I don't know, she's a rodent.

291
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,041
Why would I care what
other rodents call her?

292
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,750
[SOLUTION] I believe she
is Evileye, of Blue Rose.

293
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,708
She was listed in the
information Sebas collected.

294
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,666
Ah, right. Lord Ains
mentioned that.

295
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,708
[LUPISREGINA]
Narberal, honey,

296
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,458
I think your mind's
starting to go.

297
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,291
I'm sure none of you remember
the humans you've met.

298
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,916
[SOLUTION]
It was no problem for me.

299
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,541
I pay close attention
to proper names.

300
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:02,875
[LUPISREGINA]
Every one!

301
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,083
I actually get along
pretty well with them, too.

302
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,125
[ENTOMA]
No problems, either.

303
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,666
Uh...

304
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,791
[SOLUTION, ENTOMA, LUPISREGINA]
Uh...

305
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:15,750
[ENTOMA] An earthquake.
Feels like one of Mare's.

306
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,666
[NARBERAL]
Is this some kind of sign?

307
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,916
[SOLUTION]
That's right.

308
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,541
Okay, Narberal, time for
you to get some bruises.

309
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,958
[LUPISREGINA] It needs to look
real, but I'll try to go gentle.

310
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,500
Sorry about this.

311
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:26,916
Don't worry about me.

312
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,583
This is our job.

313
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,041
[MAN 13D]
It's the devil!

314
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,708
He's coming back for us!

315
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,250
Remain calm. We're
here to help you!

316
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,750
They took my child,

00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:08,125
If such a man truly exists.

473
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:11,916
I'd say that his caliber
of magic would rival my own.

474
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,833
Perhaps even surpass it.

475
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,333
Interesting.

476
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:19,833
Is that why you seem
so pleased, old man?

477
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:22,125
[FLUDER]
Naturally, my lord.

478
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:25,416
It takes all manner of oracles
to gaze into the abyss.

479
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,625
But, to find a
true magical peer.

480
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:32,375
If possible, I would like to
meet him personally, my lord.

481
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,458
I would also like you
to collect information

482
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:36,416
on an adamantite
class adventurer

483
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,625
known as the
Raven-Black Hero, Momon.

484
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:42,916
Think you could help me
with that, old man?

485
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,500
[FLUDER]
Of course I can, my emperor.
