1
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:15,291
[SEBAS] I will have to offer
my gratitude to Lord Ains.

2
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:19,041
I did not expect this level
of support from the Tomb.

3
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:22,208
Yes, command of this
operation will fall to me.

4
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:25,041
If you have any objection
to the supreme one's decision,

5
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,416
voice it now, please.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,125
[SEBAS]
No, of course not.

7
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:29,416
[DEMIURGE]
Then I hope you are not under

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,208
any mistaken impressions.

9
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:34,416
We've assembled to cull
Eight Fingers from existence.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,041
They've spit in the collective
faces of the supreme ones

11
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,333
with their brazen actions

12
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:40,500
and must be dealt
with accordingly.

13
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,375
I understand perfectly.

14
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:46,666
Rescuing Tuare is insignificant
next to avenging Ains Ool Goan.

15
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,333
Now that that's clear,

16
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:51,541
please know that I also hope
for Tuare's safe return.

17
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:54,208
Should the poor thing perish,
I doubt her body could withstand

18
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,125
the intense strain
of resurrection.

19
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,000
How kind of you to say so.

20
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,500
Do you have a plan for
finding Eight Fingers?

21
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,541
There's no need for such a plan.

22
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:05,208
I've already
attained information

23
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,416
on seven of their bases.

24
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:11,500
Sorry, Sebas, but you
do not need to know.

25
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,208
The success of our plan relies

26
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:15,916
on compartmentalizing
certain components.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,750
Once Tuare is safe,
you will return with her

28
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:22,041
to Nazarick, and leave
the rest to us.

29
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,916
I understand.

30
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:30,083
[DEMIURGE] Solution, back up
Sebas for the time being.

31
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:33,000
[SOLUTION]
Very well, Lord Demiurge.

32
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:34,166
What I'm about to tell you

33
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,458
is a matter of great
importance. Entoma?

34
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,375
[ENTOMA]
Acknowledged.

35
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,833
Killing this person
is strictly forbidden.

36
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:45,000
Understood, Shalltear?

37
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:46,166
Oh, ha, ha!

38
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,833
Poke fun at the vampire,
why dontcha? Jerk.

39
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,708
[DEMIURGE]
What is it, Shadow Demon?

40
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:53,958
Excellent.

41
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:56,583
It appears we now have
one more Eight Fingers base

42
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,125
to attack tonight.

43
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,416
Mare.

44
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,125
You and Entomah will focus
on the new location.

45
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:06,625
Um. Kay, I'll do my best
not to disappoint you.

46
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,750
This is a grand opportunity.

47
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,625
Use this mission
to show Lord Ains

48
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:13,375
your unwavering
devotion and love.

49
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,041
Failure is forbidden.

50
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,625
See that you provide results
that will wipe the slate clean

51
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,625
of any mistakes, understood?

52
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,666
So, uh, what about me?

53
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,666
Sorry, but you'll
have to stand down.

54
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,041
I'm concerned you'll lose
yourself to your Blood Frenzy.

55
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,625
You know what, I am not
even mad about it.

56
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,583
Not one little bit!

57
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:36,708
Now, then. Phase two
of plan "Gehenna."

58
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:39,708
It's a tad complex,
so do pay attention.

59
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,500
That mythril must've
cost a pretty copper.

60
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,208
You sure you wanna dye it?

61
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,416
It does mean a lot since
Renner gave it to me,

62
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,583
but it just stands out too much.

63
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,750
However, it's virtually silent.

64
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,041
So, I think it's perfect
for infiltrating.

65
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,708
All captains, gather 'round!

66
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,833
We're going to go over the plan!

67
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:40,666
Ah!

68
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,041
[LAKYUS]
All right.

69
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,125
This operation's goal
is to raid eight buildings

70
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:47,041
in Eight Finger's possession
and take control of them.

71
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,291
But we only have seven squads.

72
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,708
Once we've taken control
of our assigned buildings,

73
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,833
everyone here will head
for the last location,

74
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,166
so don't dawdle.

75
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,791
In other words, it's
first come first served!

76
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,583
I'm sure you're all
aware of our enemy's

77
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,041
overwhelming strength.

78
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,125
Don't let your guards down.

79
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,750
[BRAIN] The squads look
fairly competent.

80
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,333
Even the Marquis' men.

81
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:12,791
They're a full group of former
orichalcum class adventurers.

82
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,791
Name's Lockmeyer.
Nice to meet you.

83
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,875
[GAGARAN]
Hey, virgin!

84
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,291
[CLIMB] Miss Gagaran.
Is something wrong?

85
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,666
You tell me, kid.

86
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,791
Thought you might be nervous
and figured a playful

87
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:27,083
pat on your tight little
tushie would loosen ya up.

88
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,750
You must be Brain Unglaus.

89
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,458
I guess you'll do.

90
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,833
I'm glad I passed the test.

91
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,958
She was measuring me up,
trying to figure out

92
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:39,083
whether I was a warrior she
can entrust with you or not.

93
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,333
Is that true, Gagaran?

94
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,875
Absolutely not!

95
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:45,125
If you died tonight, I wouldn't
lose any sleep over it.

96
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,708
But with him there,
things'll be easier.

97
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,750
I wouldn't be so
certain of that.

98
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,833
There are monsters in this world
you couldn't even fathom.

99
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:55,083
Huh. So you're the prudent type.

100
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,708
I'm not totally adverse
to a man like that.

101
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,208
How about a little
one-on-one in the sack?

102
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,625
I think I'll pass.

103
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,333
The pressure might crush me.

104
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,958
You're probably right.
That's too bad.

105
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,875
Watch yourself out there, okay?

106
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,208
Uh, yes ma'am!

107
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,041
[BRAIN]
She's a nice lady.

108
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:15,375
[CLIMB] Everyone in
Blue Rose is just as kind.

109
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,250
Well, time to get going.

110
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,250
Right.

111
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,291
[LOCKMEYER]
Wait, hold on, it's me!

112
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:29,375
I just got back! So jumpy.

113
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,291
I scouted the place
with invisibility magic.

114
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,250
There's a young woman being
held captive in a prison cell.

115
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,791
and about five people who look
like they fit the description

116
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,500
of Six Arms members.

117
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:40,791
Five of them?

118
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,208
Sucks for us, but it
might be a good thing.

119
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,875
If Six Arms is gathered here,
then the other locations

120
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,666
should fall without much
of an effort on our part.

121
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,250
What are we gonna do?

122
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,041
[CLIMB] It's going to be
impossible to take this place

123
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,958
without significant force.
Let's fall back.

124
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,958
Fine with me. Let's...

125
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,291
[CLIMB]
No way.

126
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,041
What a coincidence,

127
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,208
running into you
here of all places.

128
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,083
Lord Sebas, what are
doing around here

129
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,208
at this hour?

130
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,375
As it happens,
the woman I mentioned

131
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:14,125
rescuing has been taken
by Eight Fingers.

132
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:17,083
I was instructed to meet
them at this location.

133
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,875
[CLIMB]
Then she must be...

134
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,666
Can you tell me more
about the woman you saw

135
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,708
in the prison cell?

136
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,333
That's good to know.

137
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,875
Having most of Six Arms here

138
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:30,333
will make my job
a fair bit easier.

139
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,750
Does that mean...
you're willing to help us?

140
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,208
I know it's a lot to ask,
but we really need you.

141
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,666
I'd be happy to.

142
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,958
Even If you weren't here,
my duty would be unchanged.

143
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,833
I will deal with
the Six Arms members

144
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,125
and provide you cover.

145
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,833
You have our thanks, Lord Sebas.

146
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,333
I will go in through
the front entrance.

147
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,708
While I'm keeping their
attention away from you,

148
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,458
I would appreciate if you
would rescue Tuare for me.

149
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,833
You can count on it.

150
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,958
What should those
without stealth do?

151
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,375
If it's just the three of us,

152
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,875
our magic caster should be
able to make us invisible

153
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,708
long enough to get
past the front.

154
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,416
[BRAIN] I was more concerned
with the others.

155
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,458
Their armor is so noisy they
couldn't sneak past the dead.

156
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:09,250
I swear, we'll bring
Tuare back safely.

157
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,416
I would be much obliged, Climb.

158
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:17,250
[MAN 11A] Right on schedule.
They're waiting.

159
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,166
[SEBAS]
Hm?

160
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,833
[MAN 11B]
The main event.

161
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,375
[MAN 11C]
Better put up a good fight!

162
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:34,500
Aren't there supposed
to be five of you left?

163
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:35,833
[EDSTROM]
We're more than enough

164
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,875
even for one of your strength.

165
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,416
Though, I didn't think the
one who beat Succulent

166
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,250
would be someone of your age.

167
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,208
[MALMVIST]
That just proves he's worthless.

168
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,166
Not only did he fail, he failed
in front of Cocco Doll,

169
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,083
a client.

170
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,166
He's embarrassed
us beyond words.

171
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,958
[PESHURIAN] Well, he insisted
that he was beaten

172
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:55,208
by Brain Unglaus,
not an old man.

173
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,958
[DAVERNOCH] Either way,
this imprudent butler

174
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,583
had the audacity to
start all this trouble.

175
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:03,208
so he will die first.
Look up there.

176
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,541
[MALMVIST] Some of our Noble
patrons like a little

177
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,416
entertainment with their dinner.

178
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,833
We'll torture you for a while,

179
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,541
then finish you off just
in time for dessert.

180
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,458
Is that Zero fellow watching
from there, as well?

181
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,958
Why, yes, he is in fact.

182
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,583
[EDSTROM]
What was that about, old man?

183
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,208
Trying to challenge our leader?

184
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,041
[SEBAS]
Pay it no mind.

185
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,333
Where is she?

186
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,583
What have you done
with young Tuare?

187
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,958
What if I said she was dead?

188
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,750
From what I've seen,
I doubt you would be that kind.

189
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,000
[DAVERNOCH cackles]
Got me there.

190
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,166
Even in life, I lacked mercy.

191
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,250
Lucky for her, she's meant
to be a gift for Cocco Doll.

192
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,875
She's safely secure until then.

193
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,250
Then I won't keep
you or your patrons

194
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,666
waiting any longer.

195
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,541
Attack me all at once,
and you might last ten seconds.

196
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,416
You're either insane or
have a death wish, human.

197
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,416
He's probably never met someone
who was truly strong before.

198
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,083
[MALMVIST] Either way,
I'm happy to oblige him.

I am Edstrom.

Peshurian of the Spatial Slash.

[DAVERNOCH]
And Davernoch the Undead King.

204
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,750
Is that so? You poor fool.

205
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,833
That title is far
beyond your reach.

[yelling]

207
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,916
There's only one
person who can claim

to be the Ruler of Death.

209
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,375
And you couldn't
fathom his power.

Your deserved far worse
than a quick death

211
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,375
for your arrogance.

Did you manage to
find Zero, Solution?

He does not appear
to be here, my lord.

What brings you here
at this hour, little one?

No, I...

how you got in?

I didn't think Eight Fingers
kept monsters around.

I'm one of the top
adventurers in the Kingdom.

I can't catch a man-eating
monster in the act

00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:17,916
[TIA groans]

320
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,583
[GAGARAN]
No!

321
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,541
[ENTOMA]
Explosive Talisman!

322
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,541
[TIA yells]

323
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,125
[ENTOMA]
Sharp Cutting Talisman!

324
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,958
Piercing Wind Attack!

325
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,375
[GAGARAN]
Tia!

326
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,458
Creepy punk!

327
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,875
[ENTOMA]
I had planned to eat you first,

328
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,125
but she looks tasty
on top of filling,

329
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:40,250
so I guess I'll spoil
myself just this once.

330
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,500
[EVILEYE]
Don't get any closer to her!

331
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:46,916
[ENTOMA]
Who are you?

332
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,083
[EVILEYE]
Back at you.

333
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,166
Is a man-eating monster
in a maid uniform

334
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,958
some kind of sick joke?

335
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,750
I can't imagine
anyone would be happy

336
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,458
with something like you
attending to them.

337
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,166
You smell of blood
and cockroaches.

338
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,416
[ENTOMA]
What did you say?

339
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,833
[TIA]
Evileye.

340
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,875
[EVILEYE]
Good grief, you're hopeless.

341
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:08,166
You need to size up your
opponent next time!

342
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,916
This one is stronger
than you two.

343
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,833
That said. I'm
stronger than her.

344
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,208
You picked on the wrong
girls, worm breath.

345
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,541
Time to swat you!

346
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:19,708
[ENTOMA]
No one would be happy

347
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,416
to have me attend to them?

348
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,958
How dare you.

349
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,333
None of you will
leave here alive!

350
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:30,041
[EVILEYE] What a foolish
attack. Reverse Gravity!

351
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:34,583
[yelps]

352
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:35,458
[EVILEYE]
You're in the way!

353
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,583
Heal Tia's wounds or something!

354
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,833
[EVILEYE]
Are you with that Demon God?

355
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:49,000
In that case. Vermin Bane!

356
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:52,791
[ENTOMA]
Huh?

357
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,625
[ENTOMA screams]

358
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,041
[TIA]
What did you use?

359
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,541
[EVILEYE]
Insecticide magic.

360
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:04,500
A spell of my own design.
I call it "Vermin Bane."

361
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,500
[TIA]
Her face is melting.

362
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:14,291
[EVILEYE] You're kidding.
It was a mask all along?

363
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:19,375
[ENTOMA whimpering]

364
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:20,833
[TIA]
A Lip Bug!

365
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,291
It devours the vocal chords
of its human victims

366
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,458
and perfectly imitates
their voice.

367
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,708
[ENTOMA]
How dare you. How dare you!

368
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:29,916
[GAGARAN]
You sound a lot more endearing

369
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,333
like that, y'know?

370
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,666
I think I prefer
your voice this way!

371
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,416
[ENTOMA]
Damn humans!

372
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,833
[EVILEYE]
Vermin Bane!

373
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,375
[ENTOMA]
That cursed spell.

374
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:55,166
You're the only one I need
to fear. If I kill you,

375
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,333
everything else will
go down like a simple job,

376
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,916
and I can feast!

377
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,708
Paralysis Technique!

378
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:01,375
[ENTOMA grunts]

379
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:04,625
[GAGARAN yells]

380
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,250
[EVILEYE]
Crystal Lance!

381
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,166
[EVILEYE]
Vermin Bane!

382
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,666
[ENTOMA grunts]

383
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,541
[EVILEYE gasps]
This is different. Crystal Wall!

384
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,750
[ENTOMA grunts]

385
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,666
Did you hear the
sound that made?

386
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,791
Her little outfit
is as heavy as my armor.

387
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,416
How's that possible?

388
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,083
[ENTOMA] That stingy spell
of yours is getting annoying!

389
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,583
What now, boss?

390
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,208
[EVILEYE] Attack her with
full force and wear her down.

391
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:42,291
Now that's the type of
plan I can get behind.

392
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,541
Give me the chance,
and I'll squash her!

393
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,333
[GAGARAN yells]

394
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,166
[EVILEYE]
Acid Splash!

395
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,083
[ENTOMA]
Explosive Talisman!

396
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,041
[TIA]
Adamantine Shield Technique!

397
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,541
[EVILEYE]
Vermin Bane!

398
00:19:54,958 --> 00:20:00,958
[GAGARAN panting]
We did it.

399
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,666
[ENTOMA grunting]

400
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,083
[TIA]
I'll finish her.

401
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,083
[EVILEYE]
Right.

402
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:06,750
[TIA gasps]

403
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,916
[EVILEYE gasps]

404
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,250
[DEMIURGE] I'd appreciate it
if you stopped there, ladies.

405
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,958
[GAGARAN] Hey is he...
Is he like you, Evileye?

406
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,500
[DEMIURGE]
Are you all right?

407
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,500
I will handle things
from here on out.

408
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:24,291
Please, head back,
heal up, rest a bit.

409
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,958
[EVILEYE]
Leave.

410
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,833
That is a monster
among monsters.

411
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,250
What are you gonna do, shorty?

412
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,541
[EVILEYE]
Don't worry.

413
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,416
Once I've bought you
enough time to escape,

414
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,125
I'll get away using
teleportation magic.

415
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,333
[DEMIURGE]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

416
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,041
Shall we get started?

417
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,041
[EVILEYE]
Go! Now!

418
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,666
[DEMIURGE] It would grieve me
to part so soon after meeting,

419
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,041
so I'll block
all teleportation.

420
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,708
Dimensional Lock.

421
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,833
[EVILEYE]
Maximize Magic! Shard Buckshot!

422
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,458
[EVILEYE]
Nullification?

423
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,458
[DEMIURGE]
Hellfire Wall!

424
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,791
[EVILEYE gasps]

425
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:12,791
[EVILEYE growls]

426
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,791
[DEMIURGE]
My deepest condolences.

427
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,541
I didn't think that level
of flame would kill them.

428
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,416
I assumed they were
at least as strong as you.

429
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,291
Why would you team up with them?

430
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:25,541
If that did them in,
they were obviously weaklings.

431
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:29,083
[EVILEYE]
Don't you dare call them that!

432
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:33,333
[DEMIURGE]
Aspect of the Devil: Demon Arm.

433
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,541
[EVILEYE gasps]

434
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,750
[EVILEYE]
Translocation Damage!

435
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,208
[EVILEYE]
Penetrate Maximize Magic!

436
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,916
Crystal Dagger!

437
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:50,583
[EVILEYE] It went right through
his defenses, and nothing?

438
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:54,208
[DEMIURGE] Aspect of the
Devil: Razor Sharp Claws!

439
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,791
[EVILEYE] I can't get away
while carrying their bodies.

440
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:57,833
Which means...

441
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,708
So be it. Let's do this!

442
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,125
[EVILEYE gasps]

443
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,333
[DEMIURGE gasps]

444
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:14,375
[AINS]
Evening.

445
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:18,666
So which one of you
will be my foe?

446
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:53,750
[AINS] A powerful, masked
demon known as Jaldabaoth

447
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:56,125
suddenly appeared
in the royal capital.

448
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:59,958
Evileye, a member of Blue Rose,
realizes she is outmatched

449
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:01,791
and prepares to die.

450
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:04,750
However, the reinforcement
hired by Marquis Raeven

451
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,750
arrives just in time.

452
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:11,708
An adamantite adventurer,
the black-helmed Momon.

453
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:16,125
Chapter Twelve: "The Final
Battle of the Disturbance."


454
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:20,041
What in the world are
you trying to do?
