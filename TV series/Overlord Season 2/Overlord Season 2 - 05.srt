1
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,166
[VICTIM]
If that is all, Lord Ains.

2
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,583
I will take my leave
and return to my duties

3
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,083
in the Great Tomb.

4
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,416
[AINS]
Outstanding work, Victim.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,916
Keep the first floor of
Nazarick safe until we return.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,083
[VICTIM]
With my life, if needed.

00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,125
[AINS]
Gate.

8
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:38,500
[AINS]
Hm.

9
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,875
[AURA] Sorry the place
is so shabby, Lord Ains.

10
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,166
When I heard you
would be coming,

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,250
I kinda panicked and
turned it into a rush job.

12
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,750
[AINS]
There is no need to apologize.

13
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:52,333
You built this place for me
out of love and devotion.

14
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:55,708
In my eyes, it is on par
with even Nazarick.

15
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,125
Thanks!

16
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:58,458
[AINS]
That being said,

17
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:02,666
I have to ask: what is that?

18
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,083
[DEMIURGE]
Plain though it may be,

19
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:07,375
it seemed only right to
prepare a throne for you.

20
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,208
[AINS]
And the bones?

21
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:10,458
[DEMIURGE]
We assembled the best parts

22
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:11,791
of various animals.

23
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:14,666
Griffons, wyverns, and the like.

24
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,000
[AINS]
That's not what I... Nevermind.

25
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:20,208
[MOMONGA]
I don't care what he says,

26
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:23,625
those are human skulls.
I can't sit on that!

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,208
[AINS]
Shalltear.

28
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,500
I promised you
punishment, didn't I?

29
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:32,250
This is the perfect
time to administer it.

30
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,416
Your humiliation.

31
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,625
Get down on your
hands and knees.

32
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:39,291

33
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:40,541
[growls]

34
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:43,458
Brilliant, my lord. I'm in awe!

35
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,833
[AINS]
Sorry, Demiurge, the throne

36
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:48,541
will go to waste for now.

37
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,625
It could never
compare to this, Lord.

38
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:52,500
A Guardian as your throne?

39
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:54,833
Truly, such a seat is
worthy of the Supreme One,

40
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,833
for it could be
claimed by no other!

41
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,416
This is inspired!

42
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,625
I never would have
thought of it!

43
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,958
[AINS]
Is that so?

44
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:07,541
[ALBEDO] Lord Ains. May I
be excused from the room?

45
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,958
I will only be a moment.

46
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:12,083
[AINS]
If you must. Go on.

47
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,750
[ALBEDO]
Thank you very much.

48
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:25,416
--[ALBEDO growling, screaming]
--[crashing]

49
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,166
I am refreshed,
and ready to serve.

50
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,166
[AINS]
Uh. Great!

51
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,625
[ALBEDO]
Ah yes, Aura.

52
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:39,750
I'm afraid when I left I
accidently bumped into the wall.

53
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,958
It appears to have been damaged.

54
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,583
Could you fix it up
for me, later?

55
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,916
Sorry for the inconvenience.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,208
No biggie.

57
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,083
[SHALLTEAR panting]

58
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,958
[AINS]
Hm. Shalltear, is this too much?

59
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:53,958
If so, I could...

60
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,416
It is not too much
at all, my lord!

61
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,000
I take it as the grandest
of rewards, in fact!

62
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,333
Uh--

63
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:04,458
[MOMONGA] No. I should see
this punishment through.

64
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,458
My... lord....

65
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:07,916
[MOMONGA]
Besides,

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,500
Shalltear's slip-up was a
direct result of my failure.

67
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:11,791
If I have to suffer through this

68
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:15,833
in order to punish
myself, so be it.

69
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,666
Still, Peroronicino.

70
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,041
Just how kinky did
you make this chick?

71
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,958
[SHALLTEAR moans]

72
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:56,250
[AINS]
All right, down to business.


73
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,625
Do you think we effectively


74
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,000
scared the hell out of them?

75
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,625
We were so awesome
it almost scared me!

76
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,750
Without a doubt, Ains my lord.

77
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,708
Their faces were riddled
with delicious fear.

78
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:07,916
[AINS]
Very good.

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,750
Then I suppose we can
call the first stage

80
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,333
of Coctyus' demonstration
a success.

81
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,291
We've set the stage
perfectly for him.

82
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,291
Now.

83
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,708
Why don't we see
how the Lizard Men

84
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,750
are spending their time?

85
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,875
[AINS]
Utterly wasting it.

86
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,625
[AINS]
Save for the Chiefs.

87
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,041
Hm. I don't see the white lizard

88
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,333
or the one with
the magic weapon.

89
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,083
He said his name
was Zaryusu, right?

90
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,083
[AINS]
Ah, yes. I believe you're right.

91
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,583
Maybe he's inside
one of the houses.

92
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,583
[AINS]
It's quite possible.

93
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,250
[AINS]
The Mirror of Remote Viewing

94
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:57,291
can't offer a view indoors.
At least, not normally.

95
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,833
However, using magic,

96
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,833
I can create a sensory organ.

97
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:05,333
Then, by linking the two,
we should be able to...

98

I can't abide these Lizard Men!

101

[MARE] Were they wrestling?
I don't get it.

102
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,625
[SHALLTEAR] Repulsive!
They should be punished...

103
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,791
[MARE]
Why are we so angry?

104

--Wait, were they...?
--[AURA] Totally gross!

[AINS] Well, they <i>are</i> about
to die. In these situations,

108
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:37,000
the instinct to preserve
the species kicks in.

109
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:40,000
If movies are to be
believed at least. Hmph!

110
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,291
[DEMIURGE]
Yes, it's only natural.

111
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,083

This much can be forgiven.

[AURA]
Right? Totally fine!

113

Leave it to Lord Ains
to know what's up.

All of you, quiet!

Oh, crap!

118

Was that too soon
for Aura and Mare?

119
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:58,833
What am I supposed to tell them

120
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:02,125
if they ask where
babies come from?

121

Turn to Albedo? No, bad idea.

00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,541
Demiurge? He would
explain it clinically.

123
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,375
Solid choice.

Shalltear?

Huh. Actually, that doesn't
sound as bad as I thought.

126

Whatever. That's a
problem for future Ains.

127

[AINS clears throat] Aura, since
we have yet to see any activity

128
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,291
from them at this stage,
it is highly unlikely

129

that we will run into
whoever attacked Shalltear.

130

But a slim chance
is still a chance.

your surroundings.

one chance to ally with us.

136

If they refuse,
we must destroy them

from getting out.

But some of us don't
have that option!

00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,125
You would not accept
us as your Chiefs

160
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,458
if we refused to fight.

161
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,916
In fact, I hope you would
cut us down yourselves.

162
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,333
But we want to fight!

163
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,916
Please, don't rob
us of the honor!

164
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,833
Let us old timers have this.

165
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,791
You'll all get your
chance at honor someday.

166
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,708
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Cocytus!

167
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,583
For the ancestors!

[LIZARD MEN yell]

169
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,000
[COCYTUS]
I hate to do this to warriors,

170
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,833
but I must reduce
your numbers quickly.

171
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,791
[COCYTUS]
Frost Aura!

172
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,083
[COCYTUS]
Hm... Seems about right.

173
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,375
[COCYTUS]
Ranged weapons won't hurt me.

174
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,041
All the Guardians of Nazarick
have acquired items

175
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:33,083
or skills that grant
us full resistance.

God Slaying Emperor Blade!

178
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,125
Martial Art.
Iron Natural Weapon.

179
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,041
Iron Skin!

[groans]

181
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,583
[COCYTUS] Not bad at all.
The sword, I mean.

[grunts] Damn.

190
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,666
[COCYTUS] You still
have the will to fight?

191
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,416
Then I shall return this to you.

192
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:44,458
[COCYTUS] That's getting
annoying. Piercing Icicles!

[panting]

197
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:10,000
[COCYTUS] Amazing.
Lord Ains predicted this.

198
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,958
That the two of you
would last till the end.

199
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,916
And sure enough,
here you are. Be proud.

200
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,666
How are you holding up
over there, brother?

201
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,333
Bad, I'm afraid. The pain
is still throbbing.

202
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,958
But don't worry, I got
a few more swings in me.

203
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:28,291
All right. Then that'll
have to be enough.

204
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,208
That last spell really
took it out of me,

205
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,208
my magic power is drained.

206
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,083
One more cast and I'll pass out.

207
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:37,291
You always did push yourself
too hard, brother.

208
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,125
But, all the same.

209
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:43,416
As long as I have a drop
of blood left to give,

210
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,791
Frost Pain and I won't give up!

211
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,916
[COCYTUS]
That was a fine war cry.

212
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,875
You always did have
a way with words, brother.

213
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:55,041
We will meet our death together.

214
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,416
Now, come.

215
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,916
Let's not keep our guest
waiting any longer.

216
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,458
[COCYTUS]
I am in no rush.

217
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,750
Far be it from me to
get between brothers

218
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,666
saying their goodbyes.

219
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,791
[COCYTUS] Prepare yourselves.
No, forgive me.

220
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:11,708
You were prepared for death
long before we crossed blades.

221
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,458
May I have your names
before we finish?

222
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,708
Shasuryu Shasha.

223
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,166
Zaryusu Shasha.

224
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,541
[COCYTUS] I shall
remember you as warriors.

225
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:25,416
As long as I live,
you will not be forgotten.

226
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,416
Also, I must
apologize yet again.

227
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,333
Normally, I would face
you with a weapon

228
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,708
in each hand, but you
are not strong enough

229
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,000
for me to draw them.

230
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,083
It would be an insult
to go all out.

231
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,333
To both of you.

232
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,333
That's a damn shame, isn't it?

233
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:42,791
It sure is. Let's go!

234
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,666
I'm on it. Earth Bind!

235
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,625
[COCYTUS]
My defense cannot be penetrated

236
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,416
by one whose magic
level is inferior.

237
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,041
Don't waste your time!

238
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,333
[ZARYUSU]
Icy Burst!

239
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,125
[ZARYUSU yells]

240
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,875
[SHASURYU yells]

241
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,458
[COCYTUS]
Want to take me by surprise?

242
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,250
Then don't scream
like a banshee!

243
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:20,458
[COCYTUS] Hm? Blood? You did
all of that for this?

244
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,958
[COCYTUS]
Magnificent.

245
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,791
[COCYTUS]
I'm sorry.

246
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,541
I have a skill that
temporarily negates any attack

247
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,333
from weak magic weapons.

248
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:34,875
Unfortunately for you,

249
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,916
that means, as long
as it's activated,

250
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,916
your effort was
meaningless at best.

251
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,333
[COCYTUS]
Well fought!

252
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,708
[blow lands]

253
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:53,666
[AINS] Cocytus, you fought
admirably today.

254
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,916
[COCYTUS]
And I always will, Lord.

255
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,291
[AINS] That being said,
giving them the stick

256
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,083
is no longer permitted.

257
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,541
You must lead them
only by the carrot.

258
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,750
It must not be
a reign of terror.

259
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,833
[COCYTUS]
I understand, Supreme One.

260
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,166
[AINS]
Very good.

261
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,333
Lift your heads, Guardians,
and hear my words.

262
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,208
The rule over the
Lizard Men villages

263
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,208
is assigned to Cocytus.

264
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,958
If he ever requests
your support,

265
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,250
assist him to the
best of your ability.

266
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,625
[COCYTUS]
Lord Ains.

267
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,208
If I may, what do you intend
to do with the bodies

268
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,541
of those Lizard Men?

269
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,458
[AINS]
Could you be more specific?

270
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,791
[COCYTUS]
Sorry.

271
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:32,541
The one called Zaryusu
and his brother Shasuryu.

272
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,958
[AINS] Ah, yes. Let's
recover their bodies.

273
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,083
I would like to see the kind
of undead they would make

274
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:41,125
if they were not
created using my skill.

275
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,875
[COCYTUS]
I think we can do better.

276
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,500
[AINS]
What's on your mind?

277
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,500
[COCYTUS]
I admit they were weak.

278
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,083
But I also cannot deny they
possessed the brilliance

279
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,625
of true warriors.

280
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,666
I truly believe they
have the potential

281
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,625
to become stronger
than we assume,

282
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,291
if given the chance.

283
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,250
Unless I'm mistaken,
you have yet to conduct

284
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,791
any more experiments
with resurrection.

285
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,541
What if you were
to use them for that?

286
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,500
[MOMONGA] The brilliance
of warriors, is it?

287
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,250
[AINS]
I see.

288
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,916
They're too precious
to waste, then?

289
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,458
Is there anyone
who can represent

290
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,458
the Lizard Men villages?

291
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:18,708
[COCYTUS]
There was one who did not

292
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,500
participate in the fighting.

293
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,875
The white female lizard
with powerful druidic magic.

294
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,666
[MOMONGA]
That one? Interesting.

295
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,916
[AINS]
All right.

296
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,958
How long will it take
to bring her before me?

297
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,083
[COCYTUS]
Forgive me.

298
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,958
I had assumed you
would ask that.

299
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,583
She is already waiting
in the next room.

300
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,625
[AINS]
Well done. I'm pleased, Cocytus.

301
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,208
Your judgement was
right on the mark.

302
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:50,125
Please, show the female in now.

303
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,375
[COCYTUS]
Lord.

304
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,583
[AINS]
Tell me your name.

305
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:56,708
[CRUSCH]
Of course.

306
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,875
Whatever you wish,
Lord Ains Ooal Gown.

307
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,833
Supreme ruler of death.

308
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,041
I am priest and
guide to the tribes.

309
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,708
Crusch Lulu.

310
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,791
[AINS]
Thanks for coming.

311
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,833
Of course, my lord.

312
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,791
Please, accept the absolute
allegiance of my people.

313
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,541
We will serve you
without resistance.

314
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,208
[AINS]
Hm.

315
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,083
[gasps]

316
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,583
[AINS]
Now that that's done.

317
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,041
I have a special
request for you.

318
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,250
If there is anything this
humble servant can do,

319
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,500
you have but to ask it,
Lord. I'm listening.

320
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:36,833
[AINS] This isn't an order.
More a "favor."

321
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:40,666
Accept it, and I will
return Zaryusu to life.

322
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,666
Is that possible?

323
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,291
[AINS]
Life and death are nothing more

324
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,041
than states of being.

325
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,166
To move someone between the two

326
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,666
is a simple matter
to one such as I.

327
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,750
I see. Then, what is
it that you desire?

328
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,583
How can this slave serve you?

329
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,541
Do you wish to
partake of my body?

330
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,291
[growls]

331
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,708
[growls]

332
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,125
[AINS]
No. Not exactly.

333
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:09,541
[AINS clears throat] Nothing
like that. It's quite simple.

334
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,166
I want you to keep an eye
on your fellow tribesman.

335
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,458
Make sure there are none
who would betray me.

336
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:17,375
There are no such
Lizard Men, I assure you.

337
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,750
[AINS] I am not foolish
enough to believe that.

338
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,958
Not even for a second.

339
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,875
[AINS] I'm offering you
a miracle, Crusch Lulu.

340
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,625
But I cannot wait
for you to decide

341
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,666
where your loyalties truly lie.

342
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,208
Seize this moment
and do as I ask,

343
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,708
or lose the chance forever.

344
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,958
What is most important
to you now?

345
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:41,208
I want you to think hard on
that while I present my offer.

346
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:44,083
Then I expect an answer.

347
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,041
I want you to
covertly keep watch

348
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,875
on your fellow Lizard Men
from the inside.

349
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,541
I will cast a special
magic spell on Zaryusu

350
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,083
when I revive him.

351
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,916
If at any point I feel
that you have betrayed me,

352
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,208
the spell will
kill him instantly.

353
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:02,166
And I'll make sure
you see it happen.

354
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,625
Spying on your people
is a small price to pay

355
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:08,291
to have the love of your
life back, wouldn't you say?

356
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,875
[MOMONGA] Too bad that spell
doesn't really exist.

357
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,541
[AINS]
Time's up, Crusch Lulu.

358
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,875
What is your decision?

359
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,416
[AINS whispers] Even if
she declines, do nothing.

360
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,375
[AINS]
Well? I'm done waiting.

361
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,583
Make your choice.

362
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,375
[CRUSCH muffled]
Zaryusu. Zaryusu!

363
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,333
[CRUSCH]
Come back.

364
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,250
[CRUSCH]
Please. Open your eyes!

365
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,333
Zaryusu?

366
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,416
Zaryusu!

367
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,958
[garbled speach] Crusch?
Why are you...?

368
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,916
Is this the afterlife?

369
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,250
Were you killed by that monster?

370
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:11,125
[AINS] You're alive, but the
confusion will last for a while.

371
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:14,375
Apparently you've lost
some levels, as well.

372
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:15,541
I guess I can reason that

373
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,791
little has changed
from Yggdrasil.

374
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,375
[gasps]

375
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,458
[ZARYUSU]
Wh-What in the...?

376
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:27,208
[AINS] Zaryusu Shasha, first,
allow me to congratulate you

377
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,791
on your resurrection.

378
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,291
What? Resurrection?

379
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,916
You can bring the
dead back to life?

380
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,333
Truly, your power
cannot be rivaled.

381
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,541
[ZARYUSU]
Great One.

382
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:45,250
I humbly pledge my
eternal allegiance to you.

383
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,666
[AINS]
Very good.

384
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,583
In the name of Ains Ooal Gown,
I accept your fidelity.

385
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:54,166
All we ask in return,
is to prosper.

386
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,166
[AINS]
Is that it? Fear not.

387
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,083
I can definitely promise
prosperity to all under my rule.

388
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,500
I offer my thanks.

389
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,041
[AINS]
Your speech is still faltering.

390
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,166
A little rest
should remedy that.

391
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,583
Take some time to recover,

392
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:13,166
then speak with Cocytus
about what is to follow.

393
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,583
[ZARYUSU]
Just a moment, Lord.

394
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:17,875
[AINS]
Hm?

395
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,458
What about Zenberu
and my brother?

396
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:23,333
[AINS] Their bodies
should still be around.

397
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,958
[ZARYUSU]
Please, Great One.

398
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:28,791
May I ask you to bring
them back, as well?

399
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,541
[AINS] I don't see what
I would gain from it.

400
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,958
Then, why did you
only resurrect me?

401
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:37,000
Zenberu and my
brother are strong.

402
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:41,916
I'm certain that they could
be of great use to you.

403
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,250
[AINS]
I see.

404
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,916
Safeguard their bodies.

405
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,083
I'll consider your request.

406
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,291
Aura, time to go.

407
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,541
Right!

408
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:53,291
Could I play with the
Hydra sometime, my lord?

409
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,333
We managed to survive.

410
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,625
Some more than others.

411
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,166
[ZARYUSU sighs]

412
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,375
You'll be fine, love. I swear.

413
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,416
Just try to focus on recovering.

414
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,083
We can worry about
everything else

415
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,791
when you have
your strength back.

416
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,625
[ZARYUSU]
Yeah.

417
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,708
As long as I can
rest in your arms.

418
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:52,958
[AINS] Sebas and Solution
continue to collect information

419
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:55,541
in the capital of Re-Estize.

420
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:58,458
Working with extreme caution,
they seek to uncover

421
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:01,333
the identity of those
who attacked Shalltear.

422
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:04,625
But they have yet to
find even a shadow.

423
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:07,000
The days seem peaceful
on the surface, 

424
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,375
at least until Sebas
meets a certain girl

425
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:12,708
on a dimly lit street.

426
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:16,708
Chapter Six: "Those Who Pick Up,
Those Who Are Picked Up".


427
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:20,000
Miracles do not happen to
those who merely pray.
