163
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,041
No.

164
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,708
We should have a separate unit,
consisting of only the chiefs.

165
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,041
[SHASURYU]
Hm.

166
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:35,000
Traveler want to make unit
of elite warriors, yes?

167
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:35,875
That's right.

168
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,583
The enemy's numbers are great.

169
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:40,500
Taking out their leader
may be the only way to win.

170
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,625
And if he's protected
by stronger foes,

171
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,625
it will take our
strongest to do the job.

172
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:48,500
But, won't that leave our side
without commanders, too?

173
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:49,708
True.

174
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,666
Then we'll have the
elite unit issue orders

175
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,625
to the head hunters
from the rear,

176
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,500
and coordinate things
as the situation demands.

177
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,500
[CHIEFS]
Mm.

178
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,541
We have four days
until the enemy strikes.

a single moment.

Report.

183
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,708
Has Cocytus begun the
attack on their village?

184
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,875
[ALBEDO] Yes. According
to Entoma's report,

185
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,750
nothing on the field has
exceeded your expectations.

As you ordered, Lord Ains,

187
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,541
Cocytus is remaining
at the command post,

188
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,791
and they are attacking with only
the forces they have been given.

189
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,000
[AINS]
I see.

190
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,375
It isn't the outcome
I was hoping for,

191
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,833
but we may yet get
something out of it.

Everyone!

We've been preparing
for this moment!

196
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,916
We know, the enemy is great.

197
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,583
But there is nothing
to be afraid of!

198
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,333
For the first time in history,

199
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,583
we have ceased to be
separate tribes.

200
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:26,083
Through this alliance,
all Lizard Men are now one!

201
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,375
I know our ancestor spirits
are proud of what they see.

202
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,583
And they will protect us!

203
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,083
For them, we will
send these bastards

204

[LIZARD MEN cheer]

They're using the cavalry
to flank our line

209
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,750
so they can surround
and crush them.

210
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,250
Then it's time for us to make
our first play, as well,

00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,791
don't you think?

their noses at us?

215
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,250
[SHASURYU] I can't make
sense of their strategy.

216
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,375
Is it possible they're acting
without a commander?

217
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:45,500
If so, they must think they
can win by numbers alone.

218
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,375
Bastards are mocking us.

219
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,125
Still, we should
reduce their force

220
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:52,375
as much as possible before
they make their next big play.

[KYUKU]
Patience, Zenberu.

223
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,875
We'll reveal the elite
unit once their leader

224
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,458
graces us with his presence,

225
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,541
then you'll have all the

Incredible.

Summoning swamp elementals
that fast isn't easy.

229
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:43,166
We can do truly amazing
things working together.

Indeed.

all we did was exchange

Once this battle's behind us,

there are many things
I would like to try.

[CRUSCH]
I couldn't agree more.

236

Hello, my friend.

Why are you messaging me?

Aren't you in the
middle of a campaign?

[COCYTUS]
Actually...

00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,666
[DEMIURGE]
I see.

245
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,833
Still, that doesn't explain
why you reached out to me.

246
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,583
[COCYTUS]
I need advice.

247
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,791
If this defeat were mine
alone, I could accept it.

248
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:32,250
But, if this continues,
I will disgrace the Supreme One,

249

and that cannot happen.

Lord Ains wanted you to win?

[COCYTUS] I'm not sure
what you mean by that.

Think about it.

253
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,750
Why did Lord Ains raise an army

254
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,833
of such low-level
servants for you?

255
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,708
It's possible that
this was a test.

256
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,166
Perhaps he wished for you
to think for yourself.

To gather intelligence
on the enemy

258
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,708
and adjust your strategy
to ensure victory.

259
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:57,416
This could be a plan
to promote your awareness.

Additionally, Nazarick and
Lord Ains were never mentioned.

321
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,375
I will make sure your
deaths are painless.

322
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,541
[ZARYUSU]
I think I speak for all of us.

323
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:45,666
Go to hell!

324
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,125
You ingrate!

325
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,416
That was your last
chance at mercy.

326
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,875
Your suffering will be such

327
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,791
that in the end
you'll beg for death!

328
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,541
Not if we send you
back to the pit

329
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,583
you crawled out of!

330
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,625
Take care of him, Zaryusu!

331
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:11,083
Succumb to fear. Terror!

332
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,750
[CRUSCH]
Lion's Heart!

333
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,583
You're okay!

334
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:23,583
Pestiferous harpy.
Lightning strike!

335

[CRUSCH screams]

336
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,583
Crusch, no!

--[IGUVA] Light--
--Too slow!

338
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,291
Magic won't help you this close!

339
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,250
Don't underestimate me,
Lizard Man!

340
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,750
Last one! You're clear, Zaryusu!

341
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:57,166
I'll just be over here.

342
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,750
[ZARYUSU groans]

343
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,916
I'll help. Middle Cure Wounds!

344
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,333
You won't best me!

345
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,833
[IGUVA] How dare you look
down on me like this!

346
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:16,833
[ZARYUSU]
An AOE spell at this range? No!

347
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,416
[ZARYUSU]
Icy Burst!

348

[ZARYUSU grunting]

349
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,208
[IGUVA] Ha. Cold doesn't
work on me, simpleton.

350
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,541
You were only hurting yourself.

351
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,666
Once I find your frozen corpse,

352
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,583
I'll feed it to the bugs.

353

[screams]

355
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,250
Damn you.

356
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:56,791
I am a servant created
by the Great One himself!

357
00:20:56,875 --> 00:21:02,125
I refuse to fall
to a filthy reptile!

358
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:06,625
I will feel your bones
crush in my hands!

359
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:10,875
Now, die, Lizard Man!

360
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:19,458
[ZARYUSU]
Rororo. Zenberu. Crusch.

[ZARYUSU growls]

362
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:29,958
Impossible! How are you moving?

363
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,291
Tell me how!

364
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:36,458
[ZARYUSU]
You're... finished!

365
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:47,416
Please. Forgive me, Lord Ains.

366

The traveler did it!

[ENTOMA]
'Scuse me, Lord Cocytus.

369
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,875
Lord Ains has requested
your presence at once.

370
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,958
[COCYTUS]
Understood, thank you.

371
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:18,416
[COCYTUS] Nicely done.
But, it was truly a close one.

372
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:54,333
[AINS] The Lizard Men
successfully survive the horde

373

of undead that was
sent against them

374
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:59,750
and celebrate their
unexpected victory.

375
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:03,375
Meanwhile, the defeated Cocytus
in summoned back to Nazarick

376
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:07,583
to explain his defeat
before his master.

377
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:10,125
Ains does not blame the
apologetic floor guardian

378
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:11,625
for his loss.
