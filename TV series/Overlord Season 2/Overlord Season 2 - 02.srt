00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,500
I will carry this plan
through to perfection

164
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,791
and then come home.
Just sit tight.

165
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,541
See you soon.

166
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:41,291
[door clatters]

167

[DEMIURGE]
Hm.

168
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:47,500
It has been far too long,
Assistant Butler.

169
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:48,583
Oh, hey.

170
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,833
It has been a long time,
Lord Demiurge.

171
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,958
Is Lord Ains in there by chance?

172
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,291
'Fraid not.

173
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,375
He's visiting the human
village for several days.

174
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,958
However, Lady Albedo is inside.

175
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:02,041
That's too bad.
Isn't it strange, Eclair,

176
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,875
for an assistant butler
such as yourself

177
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,458
to be here without your boss?

178
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,416
Lord Sebas is away on business,

179
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,000
so I must work twice as
hard to make up for him.

180
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,500
That's why I just
finished making

181
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,291
specific arrangements
with Lady Albedo.

182
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,583
I guess you're right.

183
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,666
Now that he's gone,
Nahzareek's ninth floor

184
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,250
is safe in your more than
capable flippers, eh?

185
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,625
Correct!

186
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,833
I treat this extra work
as preparation for when

187
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,750
I'm finally calling the shots,

188
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,375
and ruling the Great
Tomb of Nazarick.

189
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,166
Right you are.
Keep at it, little guy.

190
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,291
After all, your creator,
Lady Ankoro Mocchi Mochi,

191
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,750
did design you to act that way.

192
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,125
So then.

193
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,541
How exactly are you planning
on achieving that goal?

194
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,416
[ECLAIR]
By cleaning, of course.

195
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,708
I dare say there's
no one in Nazarick half

196
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,708
as thorough at cleaning as me!

197
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,125
After I'm done
with the restroom,

198
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,750
it's safe to eat off both
the floor and the toilet!

together will see you now.

Huh. I wonder why
it's not the chief.

I realize it's probably
confusing that I didn't

00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,041
settle that matter first before
offering up such a proposal.

233
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:23,166
But I cannot ignore such
strong feelings of love.

each other better.

Uh--

[CRUSCH] It comes as
quite a surprise to me

242
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:41,708
that you're not afraid of my
white body, like others are.

243
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,708
You see, every now
and then an albino,

244
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,333
such as myself, is born
into the Red Eye tribe.

245
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:49,041
They always exhibit an
aptitude for some talent,

246
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,250
and in my case that talent

247
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,833
turned out to be
priestly powers.

That's the reason
we always end up

second in command
under the tribal chief.

I've fallen in love with you.

in this upcoming battle.

I don't want any regrets.

262
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,958
I'm at a loss.

The bearer of Frost Pain
is actually prepared to die?

264
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,333
Did you see the monster
that delivered the message?

265
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:39,416
I did.

266
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,125
That horrible creature
emitted screams

267
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,833
that rattled the mind,
neutralizing almost any attack

268
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:47,291
by non-enchanted weapons.
Terrifying indeed.

269
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:51,166
Last time I encountered it,
I had no choice but to flee.

270
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,958
We druids can help with that.

271
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,875
We possess the
power to temporarily

272
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,916
imbue swords with magic.

273
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,666
Are you able to ward against
mental attacks as well?

274
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:03,333
Most priests can, in fact,
bolster one's resistance.

275
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,958
However, protecting the mind
from confusion is different.

276
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,750
I'm the only one who can do so.

277

[gasps]

278
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,708
What number did it
say your tribe was?

279
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,958
It said we were fourth in line.

280
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,208
I see.

281
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:21,083
Tell me, what are you
planning to do about it?

282
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,833
Uh...

283
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,125
I'm going to be
straight with you.

284
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,666
[ZARYUSU]
If the Red Eye tribe evacuates,

285
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,541
will you be able to
carry on your lifestyle

286
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:34,583
in a strange location?

287
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,875
[CRUSCH]
It would be difficult.

288
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,791
[ZARYUSU] So then, if all
five tribes in the area

289
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:43,000
were to evacuate at once.
What would happen?

290
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,791
What if we couldn't
find enough food?

291
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:48,041
What if the fish we
depend on grew scarce?

292
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:51,166
Would we end up killing
each other off this time?

293
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,500
You don't mean
that fighting a battle

294
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,625
we may not win
would be a better...

295
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:56,708
Indeed.

296
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,625
I'm taking into
account depopulation,

297
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,375
including the other tribes.

298
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,958
Crusch Lulu,

299
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:06,666
Green Claw requests an alliance
with the Red Eye tribe.

300
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,708
Please think this through.

301
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,250
If you were to refuse us,

302
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,166
we'd have to challenge
your tribe to battle first.

303
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,375
To prevent a tribe
from running away

304
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,375
and establishing a
numerical superiority

305
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,041
in a new land, correct?

306
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,375
My hope is, if we
form an alliance,

307
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,250
and are then defeated,

308
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,875
that once we settle
in a new land

309
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,958
the chances of intertribal
warfare are decreased.

310
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:29,958
Uh?

311
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,875
We won't be separate tribes.

312
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,791
Instead, we'll be
allies who bravely

313
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,708
fought alongside each other.

314
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,583
That makes sense.

315
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,875
I have to know.

316
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:43,166
Red Eye abstained from fighting
during the last battle.

317
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,708
How did your people
manage to not starve?

318
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,458
Do I really have to
answer that question?

319
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,041
I need to know.
Was it priestly power?

320
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,708
Or by some other means
you've kept hidden from us?

321
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,916
It may prove to be
our salvation.

322
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,458
Definitely not.

323
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,708
[gasps]

324
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,125
It won't be our salvation.

325
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:06,041
What we engaged in
back then was cannibalism.

326
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:09,291
We fed on the meat
of our fallen friends.

327
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,625
[gasps]

328
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:16,041
At that time,
our tribe found itself

329
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,375
in a dire situation due
to the shortage of food

330
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,750
and unwillingness
to fight for it.

331
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,333
But then, one day,

332
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,041
our chief came to the
village with food.

333
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,291
Bright red fresh meat.

334
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,333
I'm not going to lie to you,

335
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,041
we were vaguely aware
of where it came from.

336
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,250
Because, whenever the
chief brought us meat,

337
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,666
it was always after he expelled
families from the village

338
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,250
for breaking our laws.

339
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:43,666
We all simply closed our eyes
and ate the only food we had.

340
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,458
In order to survive.

341
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,625
But yet, it wasn't
as though we could

342
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,208
live like that forever.

343
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,000
The pent-up frustration
soon came to a head,

344
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:56,333
and manifested into
the form of mutiny.

345
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:59,083
As the second most
powerful leader in the tribe,

346
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,333
I became the banner
they rallied to.

347
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:04,041
And we rose in revolt
against the chief.

348
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,375
The fighting divided
the village in two,

349
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,291
but we managed to
secure a victory

350
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,416
thanks to our greater numbers.

351
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,708
The chief refused to back down
even at the very end.

352
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:17,000
He was on the verge of death
after countless wounds.

353
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:20,166
And at the moment he was
struck by a fatal blow,

354
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,083
he looked into
my eyes and smiled.

355
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:27,583
It was a genuine, sweet
smile without any anger.

356
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,375
Through the death of the chief.

357
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:32,000
Our tribe was brought
back together.

358
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,083
And with our new
decrease in numbers,

359
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,666
came the great gift of recovery

360
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,250
from our dwindling
food situation.

361
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,958
But our rebellion was
in the wrong, wasn't it?

362
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,375
The chief faced reality,
and found the only logical way

363
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,375
through our grave circumstance.

364
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,958
I can't ever shake
those thoughts.

365
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,291
We're neither omniscient
nor omnipotent.

366
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:01,500
Who knows. I might have
done the same thing you did.

367
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,125
Crusch, you don't
need my solace.

368
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:07,500
There are no right answers.
We all live with regrets.

369
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,333
And now, the only
thing left to do

370
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,750
is just keep walking.

371
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,541
Even as we afflict
woe unto our feet.

372
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,375
You, too must keep walking.

373
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,291
At least, that's what I think.

374
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,041
I apologize for my disgrace.

375
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,416
I see no disgrace in you.

376
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,291
What's more, do I
look like someone

377
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,375
who's foolish enough
to judge others?

378
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,083
When they're doing their best
to move on from their past,

379
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:37,166
and being tormented
by old actions?

380
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,916
Your soul is beautiful.

381
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,208
[gasps]

382
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:44,416
You have a way with words.

383
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,916
Let me ask again.

384
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,875
Which policy will
Red Eye adopt this time?

385
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:54,416
We had a tribal meeting
and decided to evacuate.

386
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,583
Really?

387
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:58,000
Are your feelings
the same, Crusch Lulu.

388
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,916
After talking with me today?

389
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,041
It is your decision to make.

390
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:09,166
The previous chief smiled
at you during his death,

391
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,416
meaning he was leaving the
tribe's future in your hands.

392
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,333
If true, it is time
to fulfil that calling.

393
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,333
I have but one question.

394
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:22,666
How many do you plan on
letting escape as refugees?

395
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,250
Well...

396
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:28,250
One hundred of the females
and 70 males, 12 hunters,

397
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:31,666
ten warriors, three priests,
and the children.

398
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,666
And what about the rest?

399
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,750
If we fail, they will die.

400
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,625
I see how it is.

401
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,625
Let me make one thing clear.

402
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,541
We're not fighting this
battle just to die.

403
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,000
We're fighting to claim victory!

404
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,875
I was hoping to hear
you say such things.

405
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,208
The Red Eye will fight
beside Green Claw.

406
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,000
I'll make sure the
chief's last smile

407
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,250
was not meaningless.

408
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,458
This alliance will ensure
that the Red Eye tribe

409
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:04,625
have enough survivors
to carry on.

410
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,333
[ZARYUSU]
I'm grateful.

411
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,958
[yawns]

412
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:19,458
[CRUSCH]
Good morning.

413
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,250
Uh, yeah. 'Morning.

414
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,125
Looks like you were able
to bring the tribe around

415
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,666
without any issues.

416
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,750
[CRUSCH] I'm grateful that you
stayed up so late last night

417
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,208
talking them through it.

418
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,833
Our warriors should be equipped

419
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,875
and ready to leave
within the day.

420
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,041
The evacuees will be
gone soon, too.

421
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:37,750
Zaryusu. What are you
planning to do?

422
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:41,041
I'll be heading over to the
Dragon Tusk tribe next.

423
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:44,958
So, question. What's
with the getup?

424
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,125
Does it look bad on me?

425
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,500
Would you like me to say
that it looks good?

426
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:51,458
I will.

427
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:52,708
[CRUSCH]
You're so silly.

428
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,208
This is how I protect my
fair skin from sunlight.

429
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,458
Are you planning
on coming with me?

430
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,250
[CRUSCH] If I'm not mistaken,
the Dragon Tusk

431
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:02,125
have the greatest force
of arms within the tribes.

432
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,291
Right.

433
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,625
But we haven't dealt
with them in a while

434
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,208
so things may have changed.

435
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:09,375
[CRUSCH] Then I think it's best
if I accompany you there.

436
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,708
It's dangerous.

437
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:13,250
[CRUSCH] Is there anywhere
around here that isn't?

438
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:18,208
Huh. You're right,
of course. Sorry.

439
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,583
Crusch Lulu, I'll gladly
accept your help.

440
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:21,625
Thank you.

441
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,375
[CRUSCH]
Sounds good to me, Zaryusu.

442
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,958
I'll do what I can.

443
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,541
[ENTOMA] These are the
teleportation scrolls

444
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,875
I was instructed to deliver,

445
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,416
and the "Message"
scrolls as well.

446
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,833
Lord Ains informed me
they were constructed

447
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,250
from parchment that
we obtained through

448
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:41,041
the grand efforts
of Lord Demiurge.

449
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,708
He said we should
report back to him

450
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:46,083
if we have any problems
using them correctly.

451
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,875
[COCYTUS]
I see. Understood.

452
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:52,333
So, once again, Demiurge
has overshadowed me.

453
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,541
[ENTOMA]
There's more.

454
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:54,750
[COCYTUS]
Hm?

455
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,166
[ENTOMA] We have been
directed to stay put

456
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,916
and monitor the
outcome of the battle

457
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,958
with the Lizard Men
from this location only.

458
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,750
[COCYTUS]
I understand.

459
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,458
Your orders are to
see this fight through,

460
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:08,458
and deliver an absolute
victory for the Supreme One!

461
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,416
Don't let me down!

462
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,541
I'm Zaryusu Shasha.

463
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,916
I've come here on behalf
of the Green Claw tribe.

464
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,625
I wish to speak with your chief.

465
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,916
[CRUSCH] I am acting chief
of the Red Eye tribe,

466
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,083
Crusch Lulu.

467
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,625
I am also here to meet
with your chief.

468
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:44,083
[ZENBERU]
Possessor of Frost Pain!

469
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,750
What a pleasant surprise.

470
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,208
[ZENBERU]
Whoa.

471
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,166
Didn't realize the Red Eye
were led by a plant monster.

472
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,791
Don't be ridiculous!

473
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:57,000
Oh, please, learn to
take a joke, will ya?

474
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:00,708
I am the Dragon Tusk chief
you seek, Zenberu Gugu.

475
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,291
Call me Zenberu.

476
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,958
Feel free to call me
Zaryusu. Now let's get--

477
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:09,083
[ZENBERU] I can already guess
why you traveled this far.

478
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:12,541
However, our tribe only
trusts those who are strong.

479
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,958
Show me that you are.
