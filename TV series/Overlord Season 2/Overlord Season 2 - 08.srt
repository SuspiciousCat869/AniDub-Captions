1
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:22,083
We'll return the day after
tomorrow for your decision.

2
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:25,250
I hope, for your sake,
it's the right one, Sebas.

3
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,916
Going out for a bit?

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,791
[BRAIN]
Yeah.

5
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,125
[GAZEF]
Got any money?

6
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:40,500
No, but if I need to,
I can sell an item--

7
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,500
Go crazy.

8
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:46,000
Thanks, Gazef. I'll try
not to spend it all.

9
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,000
[inhales, sighs]

10
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,500
[gasps]

11
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,958
Virgin! Lookin' for us?

12
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,625
[CLIMB] It's been
too long, Lady Gagaran.


13
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:48,625
[growls]


14
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,625
[CLIMB]
I-I mean, "Miss" Gagaran.


15
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:51,750
Better.

16
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,875
[CLIMB]
And you, Lady Evileye.

17
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,583
Guess it has been
a while. What's up?

18
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,625
You here to get lucky
with me, virgin?

19
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,250
No, nothing like that.

20
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:03,541
Lady Aindra is currently
visiting with Princess Renner.

21
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,375
She asked to give you a message.

22
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,166
Yeah? Well, spit it out then.

23
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,333
Right.

24
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,333
"We're going into
action on the double.

25
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,166
Be ready at a moment's notice.

26
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,041
We are going to hit
them where it hurts."

27
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,500
End message.

28
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,041
Is that all?

29
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:20,291
Seems like such a minor chore
for the Princess' bodyguard.

30
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,458
Nah. Oh, yeah!

31
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:23,916
Gazef came by earlier.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,166
He gave me a private
lesson in swordsmanship.

33
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,416
Crazy, huh?

34
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,708
And I used the strike
you taught me!

35
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:32,791
He was so impressed that
he even complimented it!

36
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,791
You're kidding--he liked it?

37
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,625
Sounds like you're movin'
up in the world, kid.

38
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:38,708
Even so...

39
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,583
[CLIMB]
I know. I won't grow complacent.

40
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,791
I'll devote myself
to further training.

41
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,583
That's good and all, but listen.

42
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,791
That move could be
countered pretty easily.

43
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,041
It's time you
came up with a move

44
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,541
you could transition into.

45
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:50,791
Whoa.

46
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,166
Lord Stronoff told me
the same thing earlier!

47
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,625
Great minds.

48
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,000
Come to think of it,
you wanted somethin'

49
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,875
from Evileye, too, right?

50
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,708
Well, go ahead and ask her.

51
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,333
Well...

52
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:04,250
[EVILEYE]
No. Magic is beyond your reach.

53
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,333
[EVILEYE]
Stick to the sword.

54
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:13,541
[EVILEYE sighs]
You don't seem very convinced.

55
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,458
Those with talent possess
it from the outset.

56
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:20,291
Take Gazef Stronoff,
he's a good example.

57
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:23,583
Can you catch up to where
he is on effort alone?

58
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,333
[EVILEYE]
I'm not saying give up.

59
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,500
Just know what
you're up against.

60
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:36,458
[EVILEYE]
Foolish. Utterly foolish.

61
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,416
Those who chase after
the unobtainable

62
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,250
are certain to ruin themselves.

63
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,125
I'm well aware of that.

64
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,250
[EVILEYE]
You're bound for an early grave.

65
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,125
Think of the people
who will weep for you

66
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,583
should you continue.

67
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,500
I never thought I'd see the day.

68
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,166
The imp's worried
about you, Climb!

69
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,375
Isn't that sweet?

70
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,833
[EVILEYE] Keep your
voice down, muscle head!

71
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,333
Well, it's true, isn't it?

72
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,916
[EVILEYE]
Ugh.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,125
First, gain some
magic knowledge.

74
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,708
Once you increase
your knowledge,

75
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,625
you'll be able to tell what your
magic-using opponents are after.

76
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:08,000
Then you can take the
appropriate action.

77
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:08,833
End of lesson.

78
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,416
Thanks.

79
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,166
[EVILEYE] Climb, don't do
anything to lose your humanity.

80
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,500
Power isn't worth it.

81
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,666
Right.

82
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,958
[EVILEYE]
Look, I get it.

83
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,375
When it comes
to natural ability,

84
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:23,708
humans drew the short straw
compared to other races.

85
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,708
In fact, many of the
legendary Thirteen Heroes

86
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,000
were species other than human.

87
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,041
Like Black Knight,
the former owner

88
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:34,500
of the cursed sword Kilineiram
now wielded by our leader.

89
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,916
He had demonic blood
running through his veins.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,916
Huh. I keep
forgettin' about that.

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,333
Tell me.

92
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,666
Is it true, at full power,
it has enough dark energy

93
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,041
to swallow a nation whole,

94
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,583
or is that a fat
sack of horse crap?

95
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,291
[EVILEYE]
Where did you hear that?

96
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,208
I overheard Lakyus
talkin' to herself

97
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,875
a few nights back.

98
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,541
[LAKYUS] Only evil unbound
could create a dark sword

99
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,958
of such terrible power.

100
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,541
Even though I am in
the service of the gods,

101
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:07,416
keeping it restrained...
takes all that I have!

102
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,333
[EVILEYE]
Hm.

103
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,666
Then, another time...

104
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,958
[LAKYUS laughs] Don't
underestimate my dark power,

105
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,000
for it is rooted
in the purest black!

106
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,875
I will dominate your
flesh and unleash

107
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,708
my curse upon the world!

108
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,458
[LAKYUS grunts] Your power is
at its strongest tonight,

109
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:23,791
that's for sure.

110
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,916
But I will not let
you do as you wish.

111
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,458
I swear it!

112
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,583
Please, Ring of
the Holy Valkyrie,

113
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,333
lend me your protection!

114
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:32,833
Hey! Lakyus!

115
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,083
[gasps]

116
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,708
I'm fine; there's nothing
to see here! Honest!

117
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,666
[EVILEYE] Hm. As a priestess,
I guess she was embarrassed

118
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,083
being seen struggling
with a cursed item.

119
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,833
And it sounds like
those pointless-looking

120
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,875
armor rings weren't
just for fashion's sake.

121
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,500
Is Renner in danger?

122
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:52,625
C'mon, let's head to the palace!

123
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,250
[EVILEYE]
Don't panic!

124
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:57,000
There's nothing we can do
about this right now.

125
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,791
Even if we tried,
the only thing that can

126
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:02,166
stop an adamantite
is another adamantite.

127
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,333
[EVILEYE]
Yeah.

128
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,833
Oh. That reminds me.

129
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:08,166
I hear a third adamantite
class adventure team

130
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,750
recently sprung up in E-rantel.

131
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,208
Huh. That's news to me.

132
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,458
Who are they?

133
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,166
[EVILEYE] As I recall,
they're a team of two.

134
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,583
Their leader is Momon,
a warrior known as

135
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:22,500
the Raven Black Hero, and Nabe,
a powerful magic caster.

136
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,958
What? Just two of 'em?

137
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,166
The hell have they done
to earn adamantite class?

138
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,791
[EVILEYE] Well, they resolved
an incident in E-rantel

139
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,041
involving thousands of undead.

140
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,750
Then, they exterminated
the Goblin Tribal Coalition

141
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:36,958
headed northward.

142
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,833
Retrieved ultra-rare
medicinal herbs

143
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,916
from the Great Forest of Tob.

144
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,250
Slayed a giant basilisk.

145
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,791
And, as I understand it,
defeated a vampire

146
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,333
possessing tremendous
magical power.

147
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,916
Single-handedly.

148
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,375
Lastly, they subdued the
Wise King of the Forest

149
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,875
with their power and are
keeping him as a pet.

150
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,791
Holy hell.
These two sound awesome!

151
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,291
You mean...

152
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,833
Something like that would be
hard for you, Miss Gagaran?

153
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,541
I could handle
thousands of undead,

154
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,041
no problem, but a giant basilisk

155
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,416
with its petrifying
gaze and toxic venom?

156
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,833
No way.

157
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,333
Without restorative measures,
it'd be too much for me.

158
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:16,625
They are the ultimate
test for any warrior.

159
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,166
I know how strong Blue Rose is.

160
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,125
No, Miss Gagaran, there's no way

00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,833
That was far beyond what any
normal man could withstand.

323
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,541
Even I--or rather,
someone like me--

324
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,916
could never bear such terror.

325
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,583
But not you.
You held your ground.

326
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,916
Fought through it.

327
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,291
I need to know how.

328
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,666
Come on, I'm begging here.

329
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,166
Not sure, honestly.

330
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,791
However, it might be because
I was thinking about

331
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,458
my mistress the entire time.

332
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,041
--Your what?
--Mistress.

333
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,083
I don't know how, but thinking
about her made it bearable.

334
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,708
It helped me through.

335
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,625
That's all it was?

[SEBAS]
Lord Unglaus.

337
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:47,291
Young Climb's steadfast
loyalty to the lady he serves

338
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,958
allowed him to persevere.

When people have someone
that is important to them,

340
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,416
you'd be amazed at
the incredible power

they can muster.

342
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,166
That, more than any muscle,

343
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,416
is the true measure
of a person's strength.

Find something you refuse
to lose, and you, too,

345
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:07,125
can demonstrate a power greater
than you ever thought possible.

346
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,875
I've already forsaken everything
that was important to me.

347
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,583
[CLIMB]
That's fine!

348
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,333
I was able to do it,
and I have no talent.

349

It'll be no sweat for
someone of your caliber!

00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,125
Strong and kind to boot.

00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,333
You're gonna go far, kid.

352
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:26,500
Thanks a lot. I really
have been a fool.

353
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,500
If I may, Lord Unglaus.

354
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,291
You can drop the
"Lord" business.

355

Believe me, I'm nobody
a person such as yourself

00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,208
In that case,
you may call me Sebas.

358
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,125
That would please me greatly.

359
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,041
Now then, as I was saying.

360
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,166
I think it would be best
if you and young Climb

361

left here as
quickly as possible.

It appears I have some visitors.

Poisoned blades.

Careful. I think
they're assassins.

Hopefully, I won't
get in the way,

but I can't let you
fight them alone.

I swore to protect
the peace in this city.

I refuse to go back
on that oath.
