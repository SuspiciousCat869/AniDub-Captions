Welcome back to the
Magician's Guild, Lord Sebas.

2
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:30,958
Always a pleasure.

3
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:33,166
I'd like to see the
spell and cantrips list,

00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,125
if you please.

00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,750
[REP 6A]
As you wish. One moment.

6
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,500
I'm not sure I understand this
"Floating Board" spell.

7
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:55,458
Would you explain its
function and general uses?

8
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:57,916
Of course. The
Floating Board spell.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,375
A first-tier conjuration
of a glowing board.

10
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,083
It floats and is easy to move.

11
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,375
Very useful for
transporting items.

12
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:06,708
Often used in public
work projects.

13
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,416
[SEBAS]
I see.

14
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,083
Then, I would like to purchase
one such magic scroll.

If none are available,
please make one.

[REP 6A] We appreciate
your business, as always.

17

That will be one gold and
ten silver coins, please.

00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:33,958
Go, Shadow Demon.

Deliver this message for me.

Tell Solution I'm
looking around the city

21

and will return
later than normal.

Now then.

00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:47,166
I think I'll head
over there today.

Please remove your hand,
you have my attention.

[SEBAS] Are you in need
of some assistance?

If that is the case,
then simply ask.

Hey, old timer.

30

Where the hell did
you blow in from?

31
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,250
Well?

00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,916
What the crap? Let go of me!

33
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,666
I'm assuming you
know this woman?

34
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,375
She's one of my employees.
What of it?

35
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,833
[SEBAS]
So, she's human.

36
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,666
Yet you've forced,
or at least allowed,

37

extreme violence upon her.

38
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,916
And where were you
planning to take her

39
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,583
while she was in that sack?

40
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,666
To the temple. She's very sick.

[MAN 6A groans]

00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,958
In that case, you wouldn't mind

if I decided to take
her in your stead.

Wait!

00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,541
Legally speaking,
she belongs to us!

46
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,708
If you take her away,
it would be kidnapping!

47
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,541
And a proper looking
butler like you

48
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,041
shouldn't get mixed
up in trouble

behind his master's back, right?

50
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,208
A valid point.

00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,583
Do you want me to
help you, miss?

52

Do you want me to help or not?

[SEBAS]
I'm not inclined to help those

56
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,750
who choose prayer over action.

57
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,750
They waste their

like flowers waiting for
the rain to sustain them.

However, you are

So, let go of your

As of this moment,

you are under my
steadfast protection.

I never agreed to that!

[SEBAS]
"Like hell," you say?

66
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,541
An immoral blob like
you has the gall

to imply that my words
don't have merit?

68

No.

No.

It's just, if you take her,
I won't last through the night.

I'm in deep with

You know what that means?

I'm begging you.

Put her down, walk away,
and pretend this didn't happen.

I couldn't possibly do that.

[TOUCHME] Because saving
a person who's in trouble

00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:53,208
is always the right thing to do.

Holy hell. Are these
all platinum?

86
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,250
[SEBAS] Take that and hire
an adventurer or something.

87
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,166
It should be more than
enough to flee the country

How-- If I may ask,
what the hell is that?

I see.

I doubt you meant it
as a gift for me,

96
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,625
so what do you
intend to do with it?

97
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,166
A good question.

98
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,500
For now, I think I will have
you tend to her wounds for me.

99
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,375
Heal it? Seriously?

100
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,166
Could you not have left it at
a temple for such treatment?

101
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,625
[SEBAS]
I could have.

102
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:43,833
Imagine, me, of all people
not realizing such a thing.

103

I will dispose
of it, if you wish.

[SEBAS] No. I have already
brought her this far.

105
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,666
It would be a waste
not to think of

some effective use for her.

107
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,875
[SEBAS] If you don't mind,
I would like you to start

108
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,333
by assessing her
physical condition.

[SOLUTION]
Very well, Lord Sebas.

Right away.

111
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,125
I'll leave you to it then.

112
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,000
I won't keep you waiting.

How could I act so foolishly?

"Saving a person
who's in trouble

is always the
right thing to do."

Lord TouchMe.

He lived and breathed justice.

Perhaps, that is the reason
I endeavor to do the same.

120
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:39,541
Though, it could yet
prove to be a curse.

122

[SEBAS]
How is our guest?

123
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,125
It has three venereal
diseases, including Syphilis.

124
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,958
Several cracked ribs
and broken fingers,

125
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,166
and the tendons in its
right arm and left leg

126
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,375
have been torn.

127
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,583
Upper and lower front
teeth were removed.

128
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,458
It also has an anal fissure.

129
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,166
There's the possibility
it is addicted

130
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,708
to some kind of drug.

131
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,500
In addition, there are
multiple bruises

132
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:07,708
and lacerations across--

133
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,208
Can she be treated?

134
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,208
Easily.

135
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,458
[SEBAS]
Then please see to it.

136
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,416
That is not my specialty, Lord.

137
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,666
Lady Pestonya's healing magic
would be better suited by far.

138
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,500
[SEBAS] Solution, you have
the necessary healing scrolls

139
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,625
in your possession, yes?

140
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,708
Then use one of them on her.

141
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,416
But, Lord Sebas, those
scrolls were graciously

142
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,250
provided by the Supreme One
to serve his purposes.

143
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,083
Would it not be
sinful to waste one

144
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,250
on lowly human scum?

145
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,750
That is an order.

146
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,750
As you wish, Lord Sebas.

147
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,833
Forgive me if I'm being
too forward, but...

148
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,166
Would restoring its
physical state be sufficient

00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,750
for you to engage in
whatever "activities"

150
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,041
you have planned?

151
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,458
[SEBAS]
Once her treatment is complete,

152
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,208
draw a hot bath
to clean her up.

153
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,250
Make her comfortable.

154
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,875
I'll buy something
for supper, in the meantime.

155

If I may, sir.

156
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,958
Tending that woman's
mental state will involve

157
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,583
much more than we're capable of.

158
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,750
Perhaps we should
call Lord Ains--

159
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,625
This is not something Lord Ains

160
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,208
needs to be bothered
with. Am I clear?

161
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,625
[SOLUTION] I would have
understood Sebas' intentions

if he had agreed to
make you my plaything.

More than enough to see
how flavorful you are.

It looks like the healing magic
did its job perfectly.

How are you feeling, young lady?

I'm sure you're hungry.

Please, think nothing of it.

Now that I have taken you in,

[SEBAS]
Please, don't concern yourself.

186
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:36,166
For a man such as myself,
it is an honor

187
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,208
to be the shoulder
a woman can lean on.

188

[TUARE] But it's so clean.
I would hate to get it dirty.

[SEBAS]
Here. Take it.

191
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,458
A handkerchief that goes unused

192
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,625
is a thing to be
mourned. After all,

193
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,416
it exists so you
may dry your tears

194
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,958
and keep moving forward.

195

Now then, you should
get some rest.

196

When you are ready, we will
discuss what comes next.

197

What do you mean, "comes next"?

198
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,166
I'm sure staying in the capital
is out of the question.

199
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,416
Is there anywhere
else you can go?

200
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,583
Unfortunate.

But, expected.

Is it all right if I
ask for your name?

I... My name is Tuare, sir.

204
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,083
A fine name indeed.

Oh, yes, forgive me.

I haven't told you
mine yet, have I?

207
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:52,708
My creator blessed me
with the name Sebas Tian.

But, please, feel free to
call me Sebas from now on.

[SEBAS]
Something the matter?

00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,666
I have to ask.

What are you ultimately planning
to do with that woman?

Her name is Tuare.

Its name?

00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,541
Lord Sebas.

216
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,666
I do not know the reasons
you had for bringing

217
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,083
that thing into this house,
but it received those injuries

218
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,416
from being exposed to
certain types of people.

219
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,000
Whoever did this to it
will be very displeased

00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,875
when they find out
it's still alive.

They'll come looking.

If, and I do mean
if that happens,

223
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,375
then I will deal
with it accordingly.

224

For now, I want you to
wait and see what happens

for a little while.

I developed the God Flash and

in the face of monsters.

Every warrior should understand
their own limitations.

is a height to work toward.

No, what I saw wasn't
even a "height."

a gigantic organization.

321
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,833
Terrifying, right?

322
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:02,166
An underworld
syndicate so large,

323
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,916
they could undermine a nation.

324
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:09,208
[TINA] We finished everything
as planned, fiendish leader.

325
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,000
And we left no evidence
of our identity.

326
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:17,041
[LAKYUS] Tia. Tina.
Did you find anything?

327
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,166
[TINA]
Not at all.

328
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,958
[TIA]
Nothing valuable.

329
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:23,166
Ugh. I hope shorty
had better luck.

330
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,500
[EVILEYE]
I've returned.

331
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,125
Happy hunting, Evileye?

332
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,708
[EVILEYE]
Eh. You tell me. Catch.

333
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:31,875
What is this?

334
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,500
Code, maybe?

335
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:34,875
[EVILEYE]
Probably.

336
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,541
This could be the
lead on Eight Fingers

337
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,416
we've been waiting for.

338
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,500
[EIGHT FINGERS EXEC 6A]
I bring this meeting to order.

339
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,250
There are several
items on the agenda,

340
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,000
but one requires
urgent attention.

341
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,041
Hilma?

342
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,041
Yes, yes. Well.

343
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,750
Word has it one of your
cultivation facilities

344
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,625
came under attack by a
group of unknown assailants.

345
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,666
[HILMA]
It was. Hell of a mess, that.

346
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,208
It was a village
where we produced

347
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:06,125
the drug en masse.
Won't be cheap to replace.

348
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,916
This loss could put
a bit of a squeeze

349
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,916
on our distribution and sales.

350
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,375
[EIGHT FINGERS EXEC 6A]
And you have no information

351
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,416
on the attackers?

352
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,583
None at all.

353
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:16,166
They left nothing for us
to find.Of course,

354
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:20,041
the flawless execution could
be the key to their identity.

355
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:24,291
[ZERO] Hey. Why don't
you bring us in on it?

356
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,375
[HILMA]
Hm?

357
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,208
Your group of
nobodies is worthless.

358
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,750
They can't protect jack.

359
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,416
Think I'll pass, thanks.

360
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,250
I can't afford to let
you know the location

361
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,333
of all my sites now, can I?

362
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:36,458
[COCCO DOLL]
In that case,

363
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,291
I'd like to take you
up on that offer.

364
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,166
Sure about that, Cocco Doll?

365
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,291
Last I checked,
your purse was light.

366
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,333
[COCCO DOLL]
Don't worry, Zero, darling.

367
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,041
True, the slave
trade is hurting,

368
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,833
especially after the Golden
Princess prohibited it,

369
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,041
but I have a nest
egg in my coop.

370
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:55,583
Ah. What you mean is you have
something major going down.

371
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:56,458
I'm in.

372
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:57,750
[COCCO DOLL]
Lovely!

373
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,833
I've had a bit of problem
come up with a woman

374
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,958
who was scheduled
to be disposed of.

375
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm afraid it will take
more than my perfectly

376
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,791
manicured hands to deal with it.

377
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,416
I need some excessive force

378
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,666
to keep my business
up, understood?

379
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,125
[ZERO] That's what the
Six Arms does best.

380
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,208
We'll protect your property.

381
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,958
And if things get hairy,
we'll handle it with a smile.

382
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,708
[AINS] Renner, the third
princess of the kingdom of

383
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:55,583
Re-Estize, knows that her
country is continuing

384
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:59,208
to weaken. Powerless to act
on her own, Princess Renner

385
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:02,125
can only depend upon
her loyal soldier, Climb,

386
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:05,541
and the adamantite team
known as Blue Rose.

387
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:08,750
To protect the people from Eight
Fingers, the group that controls

388
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:13,208
the underworld, the greatest
adventurers begin to move.

389
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:16,125
Chapter 7: "Blue roses".


390
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:20,041
No matter the era, the weak
are always the victims.
