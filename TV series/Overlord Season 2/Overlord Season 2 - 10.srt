1
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:11,833
[AINS]
Good.

2
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:14,166
We can finally get
down to business.

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,708
I'm sure I don't need to explain
my presence to you, Sebas.

4
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:18,916
Correct?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,166
No, there is no need, my lord.

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,666
[AINS]
Where's your handkerchief?

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,333
You're sweating something awful.

8
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:28,875
Here. I'll lend you mine.

9
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,208
[knocking]


10
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,708
I have brought her, my lord.


11
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,208
[AINS]
Come in, Tuare.


12
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:11,583
I wish to see Sebas' human
pet with my own eyes.


13
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,958
[AINS]
Good. You didn't run.

14
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:24,583
On your kn--

15
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:25,458
[AINS]
No!

16
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,916
Control spells are unnecessary.

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,458
I will permit her indecorum
as a sign of respect

18
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,208
for her bravery.

19
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,000
I am Ains Ooal Gown.

20
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,541
You would do well
to remember it,

21
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:39,625
for I am the master of
everyone here, including Sebas.

22
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,208
Uh! Right.

23
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,708
[AINS]
Now then. Sebas.

24
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:47,125
I thought I instructed you
to avoid drawing attention.

25
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,208
Yes.

26
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:49,541
[AINS]
Nonetheless, you have courted

27
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:52,416
calamity for the sake
of this no-account woman.

28
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,500
Am I wrong?

29
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,166
Forgive me, Lord Ains.

30
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,375
I am deeply sorry
that my indiscretion

31
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:58,875
has caused you trouble.

32
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:01,125
Nothing like this will
happen again on my watch,

33
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,166
you have my word.

34
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,250
[AINS]
Enough.

35
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,458
Everyone makes mistakes,
including me.

36
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:09,750
Be at ease. This blunder is
trivial, so I will forgive it.

37
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,291
Thank you, Lord.
I am most grateful.

38
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:16,750
[AINS] However, you must still
make amends for your error.

39
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,500
Kill her.

40
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:22,000
My lord. Is that necessary?

41
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,583
[AINS] Are you a loyal
dog that serves me,

42
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:28,166
the 41, or a stray that
follows its own will?

43
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,875
Think hard before you answer.

44
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:31,791
Well, I--

45
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,500
[AINS]
Not with words, fool!

46
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,416
Show me through your actions.

47
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,791
[SEBAS grunts]

48
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,708
What is this?

49
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,083
[AINS]
Step away, Sebas!

50
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,375
Right, Lord.

51
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,125
[AINS]
Cocytus, would you say

52
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,625
he deliberately put enough
force into that attack

53
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,208
to kill this girl?

54
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,458
[COCYTUS]
Without a doubt, Lord.

55
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,041
[AINS]
In that case,

56
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:18,750
I take it as undeniable proof
that Sebas' loyalty is genuine.

57
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,958
This pleases me to no end.

58
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,291
Lord.

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,875
[AINS] Now, let's move on
to the next topic.

60
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,625
After an in-depth assessment,

61
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,833
I believe you've gathered
sufficient information.

62
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,458
I've decided to
vacate this mansion

63
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,750
and return to Nazarick.

64
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:39,375
As for the fate of the
woman, give me some time.

65
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,625
I do not think death
will be necessary,

66
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,833
but I'm not yet certain of it.

67
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,625
Demiurge, I will be taking
Victim back with me.

68
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,500
Right.

69
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:52,708
[AINS]
Greater Teleportation!

70
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,125
All of this has
taken a toll on her.

71
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:01,125
I think it would be best
if she returned to her room.

72
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,666
Since there's no
longer an issue,

73
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,041
I will escort her there myself.

74
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,500
With your permission,
of course, Lord Demiurge.

75
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:08,666
I suppose.

76
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,666
Do what you must, Sebas.

77
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:19,125
[SEBAS]
I do not intend to apologize.

78
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:22,708
But, I am certain that if I had
gone about this a different way,

79
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,416
I would not have to break
my promise to you now.

80
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,958
What are you telling me?

81
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:30,750
[SEBAS] To go and live a happy
life in the world of humans.

82
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:34,041
Lord Ains should be able to
erase all your bad memories.

83
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,916
You can start over.
Live free and happy.

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,916
But, what about you?

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,541
I think it best if you
forget me as well.

86
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,416
After all, there's nothing
good about me to remember.

87
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,041
[TUARE]
What do mean, "nothing good"?

88
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,791
The only reason I'm happy
is because I'm with you,

89
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,458
don't you see that?

90
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,125
This is the first home
I haven't thought of as hell.

91
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,416
You gave me meals, a warm bed,

92
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,041
and a decent, rewarding job.

93
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:03,500
I was born and raised in a small
farming village, you see.

94
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:06,583
My life was as difficult
there as in the brothel.

95
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,791
We would tend to the fields
with empty stomachs

96
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,333
and dry throats.

97
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,041
Only to have the
feudal lord take away

98
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,791
most of our crop yield.

99
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,958
Those of us that didn't
starve went mad with hunger.

100
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,541
Not to mention, the way
our lord treated us

101
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,583
as his personal playthings.

102
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,041
Even when I screamed,

103
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:26,083
he would keep laughing as
he violated me. He laughed!

104
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,791
[SEBAS]
All right.

105
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,791
It may mean your death.

106
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:34,250
[TUARE] I would rather remember
and be killed at your hand.

107
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,916
At least I would die
having felt warmth

108
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,333
and happiness for a time.

109
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:39,833
Tuare.

110
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,416
I will ask permission
to take you back with me,

111
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,791
if that's truly what you wish.

112
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,583
[TUARE]
Thank you, Lord Sebas.

113
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,916
[SEBAS]
But first, I must ask.

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,875
Do you have any attachment
to the world of humans?

115
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:56,125
I would kind of like to see
my younger sister again one day.

116
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,666
But my desire to not
remember my painful past

117
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,125
far outweighs any other
desires I may have.

118
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,750
Very well then.

119
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,250
Go. Rest in your room for now.

120
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,375
I will go to Lord Ains again
and make the request.

121
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:09,666
'Kay.

122
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:12,875
[SEBAS grunts]

123
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,208
That tickled my chin.

124
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,458
I've never had a happy kiss.

125
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,083
Thanks for that.

126
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,208
Thank you for
indulging me, Lord.

127
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,500
Is something wrong?

128
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,458
Your face is flushed red.

129
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:39,208
You need not worry.
I am fine, my lord.

130
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,958
There's no need
for titles with me.

131
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,083
[COCYTUS]
I don't need it, either.

132
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,375
[SEBAS]
All right.

133
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:50,875
[AINS]
Good, you're all here. Rise.

134
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,875
[AINS]
I believe that went well.

135
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,541
How about you, Demiurge?

136
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,666
Have your anxious
thoughts been abated?

137
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,083
I, for one, never questioned

138
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:02,208
Sebas' loyalty
to me or Nazarick.

139
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,291
[DEMIURGE]
Yes, Lord, I am satisfied.

140
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,750
And I am deeply sorry
for my lack of faith.

141
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,250
Despite your trust in him,
you granted my request

142
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,083
to test his loyalty and
it's greatly appreciated.

143
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:15,416
[AINS] It's no matter.
I have oversights, as well.

144
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,125
Now, you wished to
discuss how to deal

145
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,250
with that human woman, Sebas?

146
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,041
I do.

147
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,541
[AINS] I assume you're
worried that she could

148
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:26,500
leak information about Nazarick
once she's been released?

149
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,625
Then, after her
memories are re-arranged,

150
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,500
you may provide her with
coin and relocate her.

151
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:35,833
If I may, killing her would
guarantee our safety, my lord.

152
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,000
[AINS]
No.

153
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,750
I am not one who resorts
to homicidal acts

154
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,583
when it gains me nothing.

155
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,291
[DEMIURGE]
Understood, Lord.

156
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,708
In that case, what if I put
her to work in my stockyards?

157
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,625
[AINS]
Hm. Yes, that could work nicely.

158
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:49,791
If I may, Lord.

159
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,666
[AINS]
Mm. What is it, Sebas?

160
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,666
There is another solution.

161
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,333
I would like to put
the girl to work

162
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,416
in the Great Tomb of Nazarick,
if you're willing.

163
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,041
[gasps]

164
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,250
[COCYTUS]
Hm?

165
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,541
[AINS]
I'll ask you the same thing

166
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,458
I asked Cocytus recently.

167
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,291
Will taking her in
benefit me in any way?

168
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:10,458
Yes. Tuare's an
exceptional cook.

169
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:13,541
Since only a few in Nazarick
possess that skill,

170
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,083
adding her to our
number will help

171
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,333
lighten the load,
if only a little.

172
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,625
[AINS]
Indeed.

173
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,250
I, too, have been
considering that very point.

174
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,791
[DEMIURGE] But, Lord, are we
certain this stray human

175
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,666
can prepare food
worthy of Nazarick?

176
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:31,375
[SEBAS] Tuare seems well versed
in cooking household fare.

177
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,958
Whether or not it's
"worthy," I couldn't say.

178
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,000
I, for one, believe
something as common

179
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,791
as steamed potatoes has
no place in the Tomb.

180
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,000
[SEBAS] I cannot help but
think you are being too haste

181
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,708
in your judgement.

182
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,041
If she is skilled
with homely meals,

183
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:48,041
then she is capable of mastering
other forms of cooking.

184
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,208
We should look to the future.

185
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,458
[DEMIURGE] In that case,
I would like her to help

186
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:55,000
with the cooking at
my stockyard, first.

187
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:58,625
Making mincemeat for Abelion
sheep is no easy chore.

188
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,208
[SEBAS]
I would be against that.

189
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,541
--Her talents would go to waste.
--[TOUCH ME] Come on, Ulbert.

190
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,416
[TOUCH ME] We put farming
the rare drop from Surt,

191
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,791
the Fire Giant on the guild
calendar a few days ago.

192
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,583
How could you forget?

193
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,708
[ULBERT] You're the one
whose forgotten, Touch.

194
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,666
We still have several members
who need to complete

195
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,250
the Ice Dragon Hunt event,

196
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:17,583
so that they can unlock the
ability to change classes.

197
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,666
[TOUCH ME] Yes, but Surt's
drop rate is much lower

198
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,083
than the Ice Dragon's.

199
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:24,083
It'd be far more efficient
to take care of it first.

200
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,416
[ULBERT]
Unbelievable.

201
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,541
You can be such a spoiled
freakin' brat sometimes.

202
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,958
[TOUCH ME] Look who's talking,
Mr. Pouty-Mc-Goat Face!

203
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,416
The Ice Dragon is much more...

204
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,041
[DEMIURGE] I'm not trying
to assign blame, I simply--

205
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,750
[COCYTUS]
Shut up already!

206
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,083
We are in the presence
of Lord Ains!

207
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,250
Pardon us, Lord!
We were careless.

208
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,833
[SEBAS] Our foolish
behavior was inexcusable.

209
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:48,916
[AINS laughs] I do not mind.
Please, be at ease.

210
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,583
I miss bickering like this!

211
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:54,708
[AINS laughs]

212
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,583
[AINS]
Inhibited again.

213
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:01,083
I'd like to speak
to Tuare once more.

214
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,166
Bring her here.

215
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,583
Right away.
I'll just be a moment.

216
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,833
[AINS]
She looks familiar.

217
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:18,041
Thanks for coming.
I have some questions.

218
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,250
But know that if your
answers are untruthful

219
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,708
or unsatisfactory, we are done.

220
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,958
You will lose your memories.

221
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,416
First, tell me your full name.

222
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,750
Okay. It's Tuareninya
Veyron, Lord.

223
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:35,000
[AINS]
You don't say.

224
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,333
All right then, Tuareninya.

225
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:40,250
Is your desire to go to
the Great Tomb of Nazarick?

226
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,916
To live among the inhuman there?

227
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,583
I am willing to give
you great wealth

228
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,833
and send you to a land
far away from here,

229
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,250
should you prefer it.

230
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,791
I wish to stay with Lord Sebas.

231
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,416
[AINS]
Very well.

232
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,208
My servants. I have decided.

233
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,333
[SERVANTS]
Lord!

234
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,625
[AINS]
In the name of Ains Ooal Gown,

235
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,875
Tuareninya is now
under my protection.

236
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,875
You will be
welcomed as my guest,

237
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,833
and want for nothing.

238
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,833
Thank you very much, my lord,
but if you'll allow it,

239
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:14,000
I would like to be put to
work alongside Lord Sebas.

240
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,458
[AINS]
If that is your wish, so be it.

241
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,791
Henceforth, you shall
work directly under Sebas

242
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,000
as a provisional maid.

243
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,875
At the same time,
Sebas will step down

244
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,250
from his role as leader
of the Pleiades.

245
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:26,791
The youngest of
the Seven Sisters,

246
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,958
Aureole Omega will
take his place.

247
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,625
Yuri Alpha will
be deputy leader.

248
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,458
Also, please inform
everyone in the Tomb

249
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,250
that I have personally
staked the great name

250
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,458
of Ains Ooal Gown on
Tuareninya's safety,

251
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,125
and that she will
work alongside them

252
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:44,291
from this day forward.

253
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,666
Demiurge, do you
have any objections

254
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,958
to my decision?

255
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,041
[DEMIURGE]
Not in the least, Supreme One.

256
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,708
[AINS] Then to confirm,
all the sentries posted

257
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,875
in this mansion will return
to Nazarick at once.

258
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:59,458
Sebas, Solution,
prepare to withdraw.

259
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:02,541
[DEMIURGE]
Lord Ains.

260
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,416
[AINS]
What is it, Demiurge?

261
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
[DEMIURGE]
The Abelion Sheep are omnivores,

262
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,625
so I would like to take
this opportunity to procure

263
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,333
a small amount of grain.

264
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:14,041
[AINS] I see. Sebas,
before you withdraw,

265
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,333
purchase a large amount of grain

266
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,541
and deliver it to
Demiurge for me.

267
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,458
As you wish, Lord Ains.

268
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,708
[DEMIURGE]
Forgive my curiosity,

269
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,333
but did you spare the girl
because you know her?

270
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,541
[AINS] I believe,
perhaps more than anything,

271
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:31,750
in returning kindness with
kindness, and evil with evil.

272
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,750
We should endeavor to
pay our debts back in full.

273
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,750
[AINS] This diary
belonged to a young girl,

274
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,958
broken hearted and
furious at the kidnapping

275
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,666
of her older sister.

276
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,625
To a certain degree,
it provided me

277
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,875
with a general knowledge
of this world.

278
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,750
I'm indebted to you, Ninya.

279
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,750
I can't repay you directly,

280
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,375
but I will do so
through your sister.

281
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,750
[DEMIURGE]
Lord Ains.

282
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,541
I'd like to make a request,
if you'll indulge me.

283
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,541
[AINS]
Mm.

284
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,666
After reading over
Sebas' findings,

285
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,125
there is one place
I would like to see.

286
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,708
Could I impose on you, Lord?

287
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,125
[AINS]
I don't mind.

288
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,791
You are acting for the benefit
of Nazarick, aren't you?

289
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,166
Go ahead. Enjoy.

290
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,125
I plan to, Lord.

291
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,000
[SEBAS]
We're going out for grain

292
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,666
and to pay respects
to some acquaintances.

293
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,375
We could be gone for some time.

294
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:32,791
[TUARE]
All right.

295
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,000
[SEBAS] Keep an eye on things
while we're gone, Tuare.

296
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:35,875
I will.

297
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,458
Don't worry, Lord Sebas.

298
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,833
[RENNER] Last night,
Climb captured the head

299
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,583
of Eight Fingers'
slave trade division.

300
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,250
[GAGARAN]
Not too shabby.

301
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,291
I think we should
alter our plan.

302
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,375
We'll launch simultaneous raids,

303
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:53,125
and take down all of
their strongholds at once.

304
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:56,333
If we wait too long,
we'll be at a disadvantage.

305
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:59,125
[GAGARAN] Well, yeah, but I
thought we were short-handed.

306
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,500
Can we pull it off?

307
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,583
I'm fairly certain
the nobleman I'm meeting

308
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,875
will be eager to lend a hand.

309
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,416
They're here, Princess.

310
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,708
Oh, whoa.

311
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,625
I was surprised to receive
a summons from you,

312
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:10,791
and intrigued.

313
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,833
It certainly piqued
my interest as well,

314
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:16,291
so I decided to tag along.
I trust you mind.

315
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,708
Oh, brother.

316
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,000
[RENNER] Thank you
for coming, so quickly.

317
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,541
I would like to ask for advice.

318
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,041
My advice? Really.

319
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,250
I believe that no one
in all the court

320
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,916
is better versed
in these matters

321
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,083
than you are, Marquis Raeven.

322
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,291
Bitter.

323
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,291
[RENNER] I can have
something sweeter made.

324
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,541
There's no need.

325
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,375
I'm sure we'd all like
to avoid any of these

326
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,500
chatty palace maids
seeing us together

327
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,166
and reporting it back
to their families.

328
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,083
Shall we dispense
with the pleasantries

329
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,083
and talk about what
you really want?

330
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,166
[ZANAC]
Don't ask for too much.

331
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,250
The Marquis may be one
of the Six Great Nobles

332
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,875
and a member of
the Noble Faction,

333
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,583
but he has his own
position to consider.

334
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,416
[RENNER]
Straight to the point, then.

335
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,083
Since you've been working with
the Royal Faction in secret,

336
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,958
I'd like you to
mobilize the military

337
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,291
[BOTH gasp]

338
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,791
[RENNER] True, it might
have been better to bring

339
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,166
this request to the three
Great Nobles who are publicly

340
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,083
aligned with the Royal Faction.

341
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,458
Sadly, one of them,
Marquis Bloomrush,

342
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,708
is a traitor, and has
been feeding information

343
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:17,708
to the Empire.

344
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,541
Just a moment, Princess Renner.

345
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,916
You knew, right?

346
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,208
Of course, the "shameless
opportunist" would never

347
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,708
be caught uninformed
in these dire times.

348
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,375
How else would you
manipulate the factions

349
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,250
to keep the kingdom intact?

350
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,500
That is why you
restrict the information

351
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,541
that flows his way, so he never
learns anything important.

352
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,875
Masterfully done, by the way.

353
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,208
You live like a bird
in a gilded cage up here.

354
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,541
How do you know this?

355
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,208
I get bits of information
and fill in the blanks.

356
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,291
The maids do love their gossip.

357
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,041
You truly are a monster.

358
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,000
[RENNER giggles]

359
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,125
Very well then.

360
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,541
I suppose we can
drop all pretense.

361
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,916
If that's okay with you, Prince.

362
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,791
But, before we do,

363
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:02,250
I would like to speak with the
real Princess Renner, please.

364
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,166
Magnificent!

365
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,791
It's better than I thought.

366
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,500
I remember seeing those eyes
when you were still a child!

367
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,375
You've just been
putting on an act?

368
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,250
I was, until I had
been fulfilled.

369
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,625
You mean that boy, Climb?

370
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,208
Yes indeed.

371
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,125
I'd marry him if I could.

372
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,916
Though, while I was at it,
I'd love chaining him up

373
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,708
and keeping him all to myself.

374
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,875
What joy I would feel!

375
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,041
"Keep"? I see.

376
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,250
It's an obsession, not love.

377
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:37,875
I am in love with him!

378
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,583
I adore his eyes, and the
way they look at me.

379
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,750
Not to mention the way
he follows me around

380
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,583
like a loyal dog on a leash.

381
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:47,083
So sorry. I'm quite confused.

382
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,583
I don't need you to
understand, dear brother.

383
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,875
As long as you know
that I am fond of Climb

384
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:55,000
and love him more than anything,
that is enough for me.

385
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:59,125
But Climb is just a commoner.
Marriage is impossible.

386
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,625
I'll make a deal with you.

387
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,250
Support my ascension, and I'll
make sure you get hitched.

388
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,125
I'm in!

389
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,250
That was quick.

390
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,916
The moment I saw you, brother.

391
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,958
I wanted nothing more than
to bring up that subject.

392
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,208
On that note.

393
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,875
I have another request
for you, Marquis Raeven.

394
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:14,958
I'm listening.

395
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,375
[RENNER]
Unless I'm mistaken,

396
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,000
you are father to a young boy?

397
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,000
Yes, he just turned five.

398
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,500
I would like for him
to be my betrothed.

399
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:23,875
No!

400
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:27,041
I will die before I give
my boy to a woman like you!

401
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:33,958
Please, excuse my
outburst, Highness.

402
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,666
Would you mind telling me
your reasons, Princess?

403
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,250
I'm sure you've figured it out.

404
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,000
You plan to marry my son,

405
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,416
but actually have your
children with Climb.

406
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,000
Then, my son could have children

407
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,208
with whichever woman he loved,
and they'd be successors.

408
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,541
Does that sum it up?

409
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,291
You're really proposing
this right in front of me?

410
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,375
Sure!

411
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,666
Better now than later,
don't you think?

412
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,916
--I hear...
--[RENNER] Yes?

413
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,541
...you plan to go up
against Eight Fingers.

414
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,625
I would like to strike at them
before they burrow too deeply,

415
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:04,916
but I need soldiers.

416
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,875
Where will you be attacking?

417
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,625
[RENNER]
Seven locations.

418
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,791
The problem is that each
of them are in territories

419
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,083
owned by different noblemen.

420
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:16,125
If we could uncover evidence
that ties them to Eight Fingers,

421
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:19,125
I could use it to exert pressure
and make the nobles compliant.

422
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,708
Or we could find something
during the attack.

423
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,500
Surely one of these
locations hides a secret.

424
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,041
Also, sister.

425
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,666
I have an important
question to ask you.

426
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,791
You're aware that our
beloved older brother

427
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,958
is also taking money
from Eight Fingers, right?

428
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,250
[gasps] Not Brother Barbro.

429
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,958
This could be our
opportunity to depose him!

430
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:41,500
We should definitely consider
including his drug division

431
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,875
stronghold in your
plan of attack.

432
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,041
Taking out eight
targets is obviously

433
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,375
better than seven.

434
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,750
As for soldiers.

435
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:52,000
I will send my own
guardsmen and faction military.

436
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,583
Though, even with
adequate numbers,

437
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,791
the real question is whether
we can hold our own

438
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,541
against the adamantite
members of Six Arms.

439
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,583
If needed, I can
call in a few favors

440
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,000
from the adventurer's guild.

441
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,041
[knocking]

442
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,666
He's here.

443
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:10,291
[RENNER] I think this
gentleman can handle Six Arms.

444
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,166
[SOLUTION] That took
longer than I expected.

445
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,708
But at least we know
the grain is secure.

446
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,666
We can return to
Nazarick without issue.

447
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,708
[SEBAS]
Tuare!

448
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,583
Tuare, are you here?

449
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,375
There are a number
of scratch markings

450
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:31,958
around the front door's keyhole.

451
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,833
Unless we have
three-foot-tall rodents,

452
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,875
someone must have
picked the lock.

453
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,375
Tuare's been kidnapped,
and I'm going to get her back.

454
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,083
They have left
instructions to meet them

455
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,083
at a particular time and place.

456
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,583
[SOLUTION] I wonder if
that's the best course.

457
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,000
Look.

458
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,458
I just mean you should inform
Lord Ains before you go,

459
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,208
or have you already
forgotten that he swore

460
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,125
to protect that
human girl of yours?

461
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,208
[gasps]

462
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,333
Report this to Lord Ains for me.

463
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:01,041
Tell him the situation and ask
what we should do about it.

464
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:04,791
[ALBEDO giggling]

465
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,708
--[beeping]
--[AINS] Albedo.

466
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,250
Yes, I hear you, Lord Ains.

467
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,125
Is there some way that
I might serve you?

468
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,708
[AINS] I just got a message
from Solution, or rather,

469
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,416
from Sebas through her.

470
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,416
Apparently the woman
he took in, Tuare,

471
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,166
has been abducted.

472
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,333
I am occupied at the moment.

473
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:23,291
Put together some
forces to back Sebas up.

474
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,166
Forgive my insolence, Lord.

475
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,958
You know I wouldn't
object without good cause.

476
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:31,250
But, I fail to see the value
in devoting our resources

477
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,333
to save an inferior creature.

478
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,833
[AINS]
No value?

479
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:38,125
I swore her safety on the
great name of Ains Ooal Gown.

480
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:41,166
My word is the most
valuable thing I can offer!

481
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,583
Is that clear?

482
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,500
If not, I'll spell
it out for you!

483
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,708
This affront cannot
be allowed to stand!

484
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,583
Even if they were
unaware of my word,

485
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,458
they will atone for it!

486
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:51,500
Sorry.

487
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:52,916
I have received your orders.

488
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,791
There is nothing you need
to apologize for, my lord.

489
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,625
The fault was mine entirely.

490
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,541
The girl will be rescued,
and I will personally make sure

491
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,125
these fools regret their folly.

492
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:06,041
[AINS] No need for that.
You organize them,

493
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:10,083
and Demiurge will
command them onsite.

494
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:16,375
[sighs] Still, I don't
understand. Ains Ooal Gown.

495
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,041
Ridiculous.

496
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:54,458
[AINS] Tuare is kidnapped
by Eight Fingers.

497
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:57,041
It is unacceptable for
anyone under the protection

498
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:59,375
of Ains Ooal Gown to be hurt.

499
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:02,291
Sebas ventures to a
known Eight Fingers base,

500
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:06,041
where he encounters the
group's enforcers, Six Arms.

501
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:10,708
They plan to make an example
out of him, with his execution.

502
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:14,583
Chapter Eleven: "Jaldabaoth."


503
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:17,083
Fools cannot see the truth.
