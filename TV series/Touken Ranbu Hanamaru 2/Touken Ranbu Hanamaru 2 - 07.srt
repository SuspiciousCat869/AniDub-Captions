but something about

164
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,458
that ethereal teacup
simply captivated me.

165
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,958
I wish I had one of my own.

166
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,500
[HONEBAMI]
Like this one, right?

167
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,916
[GOKOTAI]
Let's buy it!

168
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,458
[NAMAZUO]
Yeah, about that.

169
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,208
It's not exactly in our budget.

170
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,625
[MIDARE]
Guess it's not happening, then.

171
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,666
[HAKATA]
We'll make it happen.

172
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,750
Because stock trading is magic.

173
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,833
[GOKOTAI] It's not much, but if
we can't help with the stocks,

174
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,666
we can at least do this for him.

175
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,791
[KASHUU chuckles]

176
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,083
I see.

177
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,500
Thing is, we haven't
found one yet.

178
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,291
[MONOYOSHI]
Is this what you're looking for?

179
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:08,000
Ah! Yeah, that's it!

180
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,708
[GOKOTAI]
I found one, too!

181
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,666
[MAEDA]
You're right!

182
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,583
How did we miss these before?

183
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,791
[AKITA] Look! There's
a whole bunch of them! Ah!

184
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,375
Like they came out of nowhere.

185
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,083
[AKITA] If this won't bring him
good luck, nothing will!

186
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,958
Wow, and they're
all four-leaf clovers?

187
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,166
[GROUP]
Uh-huh!

188
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,791
Thanks, Monoyoshi.

189
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,833
I thought we'd be here all day!
You're really lucky, huh?

190
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,458
I didn't do anything
special, really.

191
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,625
Well, tell me how it turns out!

192
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:35,750
[GROUP]
Okay.

193
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,333
[HAKATA] This is the most
intense battle of my life,

194
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,666
but I refuse to quit!

195
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,791
[MIDARE]
Well, okay. Don't die on us.

196
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,166
[HOUCHOU]
Hey, Hakata!

197
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,208
[laughs]

198
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:52,625
Houchou?

199
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:54,875
Hope you like free candy!

200
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,375
We brought tons!

201
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,500
Whoa, just what I needed!

202
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,291
Thanks, you guys!

203
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,833
And also... Here, show him.

204
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:06,166
[GOKOTAI] We made you a crown of
four leaf clovers for good luck.

205
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,208
Whoa! There's so many!

206
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,375
No way!

207
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:15,000
And, you can have
this weird thing, too.

208
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,916
[HAKATA]
Uh...! Is it alive?

209
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,041
[NAMAZUO]
Looks creepy!

210
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,958
[MIDARE]
E-Ew, gross!

211
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,541
[HONEBAMI]
What is it?

212
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,333
Hey, that's not
for tigers to eat!

213
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,500
Anyway...
It's a caterpillar fungus.

214
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,708
Oh, wow.
I'm surprised you know that!

215
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,083
Only 'cause I saw it in that
reference book you gave me

216
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,250
a while back.

217
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,375
It's a medicinal herb,
and rather costly!

218
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,958
Oh! "Costly!"

219
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,500
All right, nothing can
stop me now!

220
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:40,333
When I'm done, we'll buy a whole
mountain of teacups!

221
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,750
[AKITA]
We're counting on you, Hakata!

222
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,791
[YAGEN] Don't eat all
that fungus at once!

223
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:45,750
Okay.

224
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,416
I got all the assets I need.

225
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,583
Now it's time for me
to get to work.

226
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:50,458
[ATSUSHI]
Good luck!

227
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:51,750
Ichi's counting on you!

228
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,291
It's up to you now!

229
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,708
[HAKATA]
Let the stock showdown commence!

230
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,666
Here we go!

231
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,958
[ALL]
Whoa!

232
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:07,583
Hakata! Hakata! Hakata!
Hakata! Hakata! Hakata!

233
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,375
[MONOYOSHI]
Looks like they're having fun.

234
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,541
[KASHUU]
Yeah.

235
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,916
--[ALL] Hakata! Hakata! Hakata!
--Oh, wow!

236
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,250
Look, it's going up!
It's going way up!

237
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,458
[OOKURIKARA]
Kashuu.

238
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,000
Hasebe needs you now.

239
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,541
[KASHUU]
Oh, yeah? Okay, then.

240
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:21,708
[chanting continues]

241
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:25,708
What happened?

242
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,791
It's like all my good luck
just walked away!

243
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,333
[MIDARE]
The stock keeps dropping!

244
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,000
[ATSUSHI]
Louder, everyone!

245
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,166
[KASHUU]
Oh, hey.

246
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,625
I forgot to ask, where
is Hasebe, anyway?

247
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:35,583
[OOKURIKARA]
In the kitchen.

248
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,291
[KASHUU]
'Kay, thanks.

249
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,625
[HAKATA]
Uh-oh! It's going crazy!

250
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:42,833
No, stop it!

251
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,291
What in the world
is going on here?

252
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,875
Thanks for coming to help.

253
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,083
No problem.

254
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,541
Yeah! Now it's up!

255
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,083
Getting ready to sell...

256
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,500
Aw yeah, more money, more money!

257
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:05,083
[ALL]
Ah... whoa!

258
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,291
Whoa!

259
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,333
[HAKATA whining]

260
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,333
I blew it.

261
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:23,125
[HAKATA whining]

262
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,375
[MIDARE]
Is he dead?

263
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,000
This is our fault, too,
we shouldn't have dumped

264
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,250
all the hard work on Hakata.

265
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,916
Well, we can't fix
the money problem,

266
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,708
but we can try to cheer him up!

267
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,458
What d'you say, guys? You in?

268
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:34,666
Yeah, of course!

269
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,791
Great idea.

270
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,333
But what does he like?

271
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,708
[GROUP]
Hmm...

272
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,875
Let's ask around, I'm sure
someone knows more

273
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,125
about his history.

274
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,333
[HASEBE]
Depressed, huh?

275
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,375
I see.

276
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,166
[YAGEN] You were with the
Kuroda Clan at the same time

277
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,750
as him, right?

278
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,583
Is there anything from back then
that might help cheer him up?

279
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,625
--[rustling]
--[NIHONGOU] That's easy!

280
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,458
Have a Gion Yamakasa!

281
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,333
Do you think we could?

282
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,375
[MAEDA]
Wait.

283
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,666
What is a Yamakasa?

284
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,625
It's a festival held every
year in Hakata's hometown.

285
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:13,291
It's named after these giant
floats that people pile onto

286
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,625
and parade around town.

287
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:18,333
It is the right season,
but I wonder if we have

288
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,583
the resources.

289
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,416
Well, it doesn't
have to be perfect.

290
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,583
As long as it cheers
him up, we're good.

291
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:24,958
You're right!

292
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,458
But still, we'll need a float.

293
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,583
[NIHONGOU]
Ha, then make one!

294
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:30,625
It's okay.

295
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,041
Right, Hasebe?

296
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,625
Fine, fine.

297
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,041
I'll ask the master
and see what they think.

298
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,500
--[YAGEN, MAEDA] Thank you.
--[GOKOTAI] Thank you very much.

299
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,750
[NIHONGOU]
We're on top of this.

300
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,958
Long as there's a float,
we got all the festival

301
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,541
we need, right?

302
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,708
One look at this and
Hakata will be right back

303
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:50,958
to his old self.

304
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,541
This is coming together fast!

305
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,708
Uh-huh!

306
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,083
We gotta get these stalls
in working order

307
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,583
before Hakata finds out!

308
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,583
This is gonna be a blast!

309
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:06,458
So, hey.

310
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,041
What are we building?

311
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:11,208
Hmm... Gotta be a food stall.
What else?

312
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,708
I bet you're the
most awesome chef

313
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,333
in the whole world, Mitsu!

314
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,666
I don't think I'd go
that far, but thank you.

315
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,041
I'll give it my best!

You're making the banner?

317
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,416
You've decided what
you want it to say?

318
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,333
[KOUSETSU]
If it pleases you, yes.

319
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,875
I think that's perfect.

320
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,291
It's even worse than before.

00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:55,041
Hey, Hakata, how 'bout
a little change of pace?

323
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,791
I can't, the stock might
go up while I'm not here.

324
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,458
[MIDARE]
Just come with me for a sec.

325
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,291
[HAKATA]
You guys...

326
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,625
[HAKATA]
It's a Yamakasa!

327
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,000
So, what d'you say, kid?

328
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,916
Does it pass the test?

329
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,666
Can't believe they're going
to carry that thing around.

330
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,750
I can't wait to see.

331
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,458
They did this every year, huh?

332
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,000
Sounds like your
hometown was fun.

333
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:26,000
Would it be okay if I
worked on it with you?

334
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,166
[NIHONGOU] Like I could
say no to that face!

335
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,208
[HAKATA gasps]

336
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,333
I'm coming in.

337
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,083
[gasps] Scared me.

338
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,625
Here. From the Master.

339
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,083
So tell me how cute I look!

340
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:59,708
[ALL chattering]

341
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,416
Thanks for all this, Hasebe.

342
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,250
Don't mention it. Of course.

343
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,583
I'm just worried it might rain.

344
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,000
Y'think we're ready or what?

345
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:20,958
Yeah!

346
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,083
[rain dripping]

347
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,000
[HAKATA] My luck is
really in the pits, huh?

348
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,000
Eh, it's not so bad,

349
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,375
we just gotta wait
until the rain lets up.

350
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:49,041
It won't be long at all.

351
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,166
Have patience.
Don't lose heart yet.

352
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,041
[MONOYOSHI]
Hey, we're back.

353
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,750
Oh, went on an expedition?

354
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,208
Uh-huh.

355
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,083
We already heard the big news.

356
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,208
So we're having
a festival today?

357
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,875
It's raining.

358
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,000
We can't.

359
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,458
Looks like it's clearing
up if you ask me.

360
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,083
[HAKATA]
It's a miracle!

361
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,500
You really are good luck.

362
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,666
I've been watching this
happen all day long.

363
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,291
When my master
took me into battle,

364
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,208
he would win, without a doubt.

365
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:33,333
I was like a good luck
charm for the clan.

366
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,583
Yeah, I see what you mean.

367
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:38,333
I hope I can bring
good luck here, too.

368
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:48,500
[GROUP] Heave-ho! Heave-ho!
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

369
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:49,666
[chanting continues]

370
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,291
[HAKATA]
This was the best day ever!

371
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,750
[SHOKUDAIKIRI]
Another udon is ready!

372
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,208
Coming!

373
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,166
Satisfaction guaranteed!

374
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,291
[NIKKARI]
Why, thank you.

375
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:06,166
Hey, Kara! Pretty tasty, huh?

376
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,041
[OOKURIKARA]
Yeah.

377
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,125
[HASEBE humming]

378
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,416
Cold noodles make
for the perfect texture.

379
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,500
All done! Enjoy!

380
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,458
Can you get that one for me?

381
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,458
Easy!

382
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,833
Whoa, wait, hey,
that's not how you play!

383
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:38,875
Gah!

384
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:44,250
Whoa, they're so pretty!

385
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,166
We have some
candied apples as well.

386
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,208
[HOUCHOU]
Sweet!

387
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,083
We should have a
festival every day!

388
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,625
My brother's the best.

389
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:54,791
So cool.

390
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,833
Ka, ka, ka!

391
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,708
We might as well do
the Star Festival

392
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,291
while we're at it, right?

393
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,083
We'll hang our wishes
on these here!

394
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,750
[AKITA]
I want to write a wish!

395
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,125
I've heard that in the past,

396
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,916
people didn't write
wishes on these papers,

397
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,166
but rather, wrote what they
wanted to improve upon

398
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,958
in the coming year.

399
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,375
So like a personal goal,
that kinda thing?

400
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,041
Oh, easy! I want to
get better at dancing!

401
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,416
I want to make more effective
medicine, and fertilizer too!

402
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,708
I want to be brave
and tough and cool!

403
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,250
I want to make the best
tea in the whole Citadel.

404
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:40,250
Huh. I'm already cute and
strong, so this is kinda tough.

405
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,708
[KASHUU]
I'll bend the rules a little.

406
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,041
I know that you can't hear me,

407
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,625
but we're all having fun
here without you again.

408
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,125
Come back soon, Yasusada.

409
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,166
That should do it.

410
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,458
[YASUSADA]
They're really blowing up now!

411
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,916
[HAKATA] I'm pretty sure there
was a fan in here somewhere.

412
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,041
Found it!

413
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,041
With my name, too.

414
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,625
Okay, I better hurry
back to the festival!

415
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,625
Huh? Huh?! Huh?!

416
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,416
[HAKATA]
It's really blowing up now!

417
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,000
[KASHUU]
Huh?

418
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,208
What the heck?

419
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:03,750
Wow!

420
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,541
My wish came true and I'm
a fabulous dancer already!

421
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,000
[KASHUU gasps]

422
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:11,625
And I've become the
perfect dancing machine!

423
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:14,333
[MAEDA] This Festival's
getting wild and crazy!

424
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,666
[NAKIGITSUNE (FOX)] I guess
I'll have to break out my

425
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,916
producer chair once again!

426
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,916
All right, if my brothers
are singing, I'm singing too!

427
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,041
[KASHUU]
Huh? What the--?

428
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,250
How? Why?

429
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:02,750
What a nightmare.
