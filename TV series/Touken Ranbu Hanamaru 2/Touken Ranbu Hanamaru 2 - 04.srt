is our dumb new master!

anything about it at all.

it comes to Nobunaga.

embarrassed about it?

And I'm the captain.

I think I saw Fudou on the roof.

Ah. I think we're done here.

If I see him again, I can--

181
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,333
Hey! Let go of me!

182

You idiot!

What d'you think you're doing?

185
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,666
[FUDOU] Lord Nobunaga died
and I couldn't protect him.

186
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,291
I couldn't repay him for
the kindness he showed me.

187
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,541
But now...

188
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:27,041
I have a chance to make
up for my past failures.

So, please.

Oda Nobunaga is not
your master anymore.

191

You have a
responsibility to carry out

your new master's orders
to preserve history!

I don't care!

Maybe you want to throw
away all your old memories,

but not me!

You're right!
You really are useless!

Leave me alone.
I'm done with this.

What is his problem?

He's still new--
give him a break.

200

Not all of us are so adept
at leaving our past behind.

No, you're right.

202
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,041
But if he keeps
up this attitude,

203
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,958
it could put our
missions in jeopardy.

204
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,500
That's fair enough.

205
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:08,208
Still. I think a more
gentle approach might be

206
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:09,416
in order next time.

up stranded ourselves!

you can start by coming back!

Why do they care?

Even if I'm good for nothing.

[HASEBE] You need to
stop blaming yourself

for Lord Nobunaga's death.

When humans are born,
they're destined to die.

266
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:09,333
No sword, no matter how
strong, can change that.

267
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,750
I wasn't treasured.
I was given away.

268
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:16,041
But as a Sword Warrior, I've
vowed to protect that history.

269
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,791
My resentment and
regret are meaningless,

270
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,708
but that's just my lot in life.

271
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:25,708
So if I protect history, then I
protect Lord Nobunaga's legacy?

272
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,791
You might say that.

273

Do you think I could love
our master as much as

Well that's up
to you, I suppose.

276
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,625
Yeah, okay.

277
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,791
For starters, can you tell
me something about them?

278
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,291
That's a difficult question

279
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,541
since I can never tell
what they're thinking.

280
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,500
But I do know they
have a kind heart,

281
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,208
and they always care for us.

282
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,125
Also, they hardly
ever leave their room,

283
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,291
which is a shame,
because it's such a mess.

284
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,291
A little organization
goes a long way,

285
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,708
I tell them, but they
won't hear anything of it.

286
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,208
[TAROUTACHI] I was waiting
on the cherry blossoms,

287

but it's a good thing they
bloomed after the storm.

Just think if they
all washed away!

289

Wouldn't make for much
of a picnic, huh?

Hey, Fudou.

00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,500
Yeah, what's up?

292
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:20,333
After that big storm,
did you and Hasebe make up?

293
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:21,958
I guess so.

All done over here!

00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:27,208
Then we should celebrate
with the first drink of the day!

forward to this all year!

I can't wait!

00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,291
Me either.

300
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,416
Ha! Got another

is bordering on insolence.

Listen well.

307
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:07,541
For I was forged at the dawn of
the modern era of sword making.

308
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,041
In a sense,

309
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,291
I am like the parent of all
swords who have followed me.

310

me "father," if you like.

my old man for that.

Oh?

320
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,750
And what do you like
about him in particular?

321
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,708
He's like super
smooth and fluffy

322
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,583
and all warm and soft and stuff!

323
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,541
He's super smart on top of that!

324
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:37,666
Wait, he's fluffy?

325
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,708
I see.

326
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,750
Then he too possesses
the wisdom of age.

327
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,875
That is quite admirable.

328
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,875
Perhaps you should
revere the both of us

329
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,125
as a father, then.

330
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,083
I was excited at first,
but man, is he weird.

331
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,333
What should we do?

332
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,666
[YAMANBAGIRI]
Kashuu does the introductions.

333
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,458
Let him deal with this.

334
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,041
[SHISHIOU]
Where is he, though?

335
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,708
Outside. For the
cherry blossom picnic.

336
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,083
I'll go, You stay here.

337
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,208
Was worth a try.

338
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,375
We should both go.

339
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,291
"Cherry blossom picnic,"
you said?

340
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,625
Yeah.

00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,125
I assume there will be
alcohol involved as well?

342
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,208

Ah. And who is
this new recruit?

00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:22,083
I'm Kogarasumaru, and you
may revere me as a father.

--[MIDARE] Uh... Whoa.
--[ATSUSHI] Father?

347
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,250
He was the first modern
sword or something.

00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,000
I don't really
understand it, myself.

349

We have a dad? That's awesome!

350
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,291
Whoa, Sword Daddy!

Come, children.

353
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,583
We shall attend
the picnic as a family.

354
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,375
Perfect, we were
on our way just now!

355
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,291
[KOGARASUMARU chuckles]

356
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,666
Forward, we march!

00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,125
Yes sir, Sword Daddy!

Is everyone ready?

Make way! For here he comes!

360
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,708
Show reverence to this
lord among swords!

361
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,666
He is the one known as
our honored Sword Daddy!

362
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,666
Kogarasumaru has
arrived at the picnic!

363
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,000
You may call me
father, if you please.

00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,500
We would be honored
to sit with you,

if you would have us.

366
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,375
But of course!

367
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,916
We have plenty of room for
you and your little attendants!

368
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,541
Don't encourage them.
It's awkward enough.

369
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:20,583
Now, then.

I'll pour it for you. Here.

373

A father is allowed to spoil
his child a bit, right?

374
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,083
Usually, I'm the one taking
care of the other swords.

375
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,375
This is nice, too.

Well, then.

377
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,250
Although this makes
for a fine start,

378
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,541
I wonder if we might
have some entertainment.

What?

380
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,416
I say that's a brilliant idea!

Hey, guys!

We wanna give Kogarasumaru
a proper welcome.

So how 'bout we
heat things up a bit

he writes, but upon rice.
