00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:16,458
[KASHUU]
You're really leaving, huh?

2
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,208
Yeah.

3
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:19,916
[KASHUU]
Where to?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,208
Dunno yet.

5
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,375
[KASHUU]
And when will you come back?

6
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:25,166
Can't say.

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,666
[KASHUU]
I see.

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,000
You said you wanted
to become stronger, right?

9
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:32,666
Well get as strong as you like
and come back when you're done.

10
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,000
[YASUSADA chuckles]

11
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:45,500
I'll see you soon.

12
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,041
I didn't notice you, Master.

13
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,583
It's rare treat to have
you down here with us.

14
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:34,958
Try to stay warm!

15
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,458
[KASHUU] This is a tale of the
legendary sword warriors

16
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:44,000
and the Hanamaru days they
spent in a certain Citadel.

17
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:55,666
[HASEBE]
Assemble!

18
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,583
Good morning, Sword Warriors.

19
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,833
[ALL]
Good morning!

20
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,833
[HASEBE]
Do you know what today is?

21
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,125
It's New Year's Eve!

22
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:09,250
That's right.
The last day of the year.

23
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,791
A time to assert
our conviction anew.

24
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,291
Granted human form through
the power of the Sage,

25
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,833
we vow to oppose the
Historical Revisionists

26
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,000
and battle the History
Retrograde army,

27
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,000
wherever and whenever
they appear.

28
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,291
We are the lone force
preserving our timeline

29
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,791
and repelling their attempts
to alter the future.

30
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,791
We must remain vigilant,
no matter the circumstances.

31
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,208
Which is the opposite of
what you're doing right now!

32
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,458
You're not even awake!

33
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,083
Kuniyuki!

34
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,458
[MIKAZUKI laughs]

35
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,125
[MIKAZUKI] Constant vigilance
leads to exhaustion

36
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,208
of body and spirit alike.

37
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:42,416
If one works hard, they
must relax in equal measure.

38
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,166
Hasebe, would you like some tea?

39
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,541
Equal measure my foot!

40
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,125
Relaxing is all you do!

41
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,458
Listen!

42
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:49,750
Although it may seem that
we have a lot of time

43
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,166
on our hands,

44
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,083
those hours should be devoted
to careful preparation!

45
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,041
We never know when we
may be called into battle,

46
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:58,291
so we must have our skills
honed and our weapons ready.

47
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,583
I'm talking here!

48
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,708
Now, now, let's calm down.

49
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:02,958
You should make
your announcement

50
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,666
before you
completely lose them.

51
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,791
[HASEBE clears throat]

52
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,208
Good point.

53
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,666
You were asked to clean
your rooms a few days ago.

54
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,500
Make sure you finish that today.

[ALL]
'Kay.

56
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,583
[HASEBE] Those who have
already completed that task

57
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,041
should clean the common areas,

58
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,791
such as the kitchen
and the baths.

59
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,041
Of course,

60
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,041
I will be responsible
for the master's room,

61
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,500
as is my duty
as their attendant.

62
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:25,625
Dismissed.

63
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,291
[GOKOTAI yells]

64
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,625
Hey, are you all right?

65
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,625
Just startled, that's all.

66
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,208
[MAEDA]
Look at this.

67
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,500
There's so much junk in here, I
don't even know where to start.

68
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:38,750
[KONNOSUKE]
Pardon me!

69
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,708
Greetings, all.

70
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,750
I am Konnosuke,
a helpful assistant

71
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,583
newly assigned to
the Citadel here.

72
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:47,958
[PREVIOUS KONNOSUKE]
I warn you.

73
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:52,000
Do not grow lax in your
duties once I depart.

74
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,958
Remember to take out the trash!

75
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,083
[KONNOSUKE]
Ah! Greetings! It's an honor!

76
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,000
Ah! The new recruit is here!

77
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,708
Gosh. I had no idea
Konnosukes were replaced.

78
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,083
Are you retiring?

79
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,291
No, he was assigned
to a different post.

80
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,750
It's no surprise that you've
never heard of such a thing,

81
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,958
seeing as this is a
very rare occurrence.

82
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,625
Although it is an honor
to carry on in his stead.

83
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:16,625
We're all from the
same mythical fox office.

84
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:20,291
It's a cause for celebration
when we're given field work.

85
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,750
So that's how it works, huh?

86
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,625
I mostly attended the master
during my service here,

87
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,791
but it turns out this
fellow is quite fond

88
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,250
of making new friends,
so I hope you all get along.

89
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,208
My interests include fried tofu,

90
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,708
stewed tofu,
and tofu sandwiches.

91
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,583
I look forward to
working with you.

to working with you.

00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,291
Is the master around?

95
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,666
Yes. They're flawless.

00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,333
[HORIKAWA]
Kashuu.

97
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,333
Are you finished cleaning
your room? We need some help.

98
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,958
I've been done
for a little while.

99
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,791
I don't know what he needs,
but Mutsunokami asked for us.

100
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,083
He said we should meet
him in the reception hall.

101
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,708
No problem.

102
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,333
I'll go there
once I put this up.

103
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,041
[HORIKAWA] Okay, I'll see
you in a second, then.

104
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,458
[MUTSUNOKAMI laughs]
Good stuff!

105
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:21,791
What the hell are you doing?

106
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,416
Hey! You know me
and my pictures!

107
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
In fact, I've taken so many
that it's turned into

108
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:27,958
a real mess.

109
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:31,208
I invited everyone here
to help me organize them.

110
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,375
Stop!

111
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,916
If you take more,
then we'll never finish!

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,416
[MUTSUNOKAMI laughing]

113
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,291
When I look at my old ones,
I can help myself!

114
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,875
Huh. Go figure.

115
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:43,333
Hm. You are the first sword to
come to this Citadel, correct?

116
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,416
Kashuu Kiyomitsu.

117
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,541
[KASHUU]
Wait, what?

118
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,208
Why are you asking
me that, Konnosuke?

119
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,541
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
Oh, should've told you.

120
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:50,750
Take a closer look.

121
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,291
It's actually a totally
different Konnosuke.

122
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,166
I was just transferred
to the Citadel.

123
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,625
This is my first day.

124
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,750
I look forward
to working with you.

125
00:06:58,833 --> 00:06:59,958
Same here.

126
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:03,166
[KANESADA] Aw, jeez.
We'll never finish this.

127
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,958
I have no complaints!
This is fun!

128
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,916
We sure had a busy year,
didn't we?

129
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,333
So many memories.

130
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:13,083
We've had so many new
Sword Warriors join us, too.

131
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,458
You're right.

132
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:17,708
Did you see this one?

133
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,416
It makes me wonder
what Yamatonokami

134
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,416
is doing right now.

135
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,583
[KASHUU]
Who knows?

136
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,500
I'm sure he's doing
fine wherever he is.

137
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,750
Well I hope he comes
back soon either way.

138
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,916
Ichi, look at these ones!

139
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,666
They're pictures from when
we all went to the beach!

140
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,333
[ICHIGO]
Right before I manifested.

141
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:39,458
[MIDARE] The Master made
those swimsuits for us by hand!

142
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,583
Even though I wasn't here yet,

143
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,291
when I look at these,
I don't feel so bad about it.

144
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,916
So thank you for that.

145
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,291
Yeah! Of course!

146
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,708
And when the next one
of us shows up,

147
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,750
he'll have even more
pictures to look at!

148
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,250
We'd better have fun, then.

149
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,500
Not just for our sake,

150
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,291
but to let the new
Sword Warriors know

151
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:56,750
they'll be happy here.

152
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,250
All right!

153
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,791
After we're done with this,
let's get everyone together

154
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,125
for something awesome!

155
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,875
It's time for a party!

156
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,958
[TSURUMARU] Then we should
celebrate New Year's.

157
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:07,791
Like humans do?

158
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,291
Wouldn't that be weird?

159
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,208
Nah.

160
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,708
We may have the soul of a sword,

161
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,333
but our bodies are human
enough, I would say.

162
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:18,333
If they can make mochi and
draw fortunes, so can we.

163
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,625
Well, sound like fun?

164
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:20,791
Great idea!

165
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,458
I can't wait!

166
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:25,291
[MUTSUNOKAMI] We don't have much
time, so we better get moving!

167
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,500
[HIZAMARU]
Come back!

168
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,541
[HIGEKIRI]
My, look at all the people.

169
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,500
[HIZAMARU] Don't wander
off like that! Jeez!

170
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,166
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
New recruits?

171
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,541
Hey. I'm Higekiri, treasure
of the Minamoto Clan.

172
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,791
This is my little brother, um...
Huh, uh...

173
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,166
How could you forget?
We're family!

174
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,291
I'm also a treasure of the
Minamoto Clan. Hizamaru.

175
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,500
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
That's harsh.

176
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,708
Do you just have a
bad memory or what?

177
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:52,000
I don't concern myself with
unnecessary details, okay?

178
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,041
It's not his fault!

179
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,875
Our names keep changing, is all.

180
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,625
We're both tachi blades
from the Heian period.

181
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,958
My brother's name
means "beard cutter."

182
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:03,041
Once, when he killed a criminal,
he cut his beard, too.

183
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,791
I was called "both knees"
'cause I cut through

184
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,250
two legs in one slash.

185
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,833
However...

186
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,500
We've also been used
to slay evil spirits,

187
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,958
and different owners have
bestowed us different titles,

188
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,833
so our names often change.

189
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,041
So what should I call you now?

190
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,833
Hizamaru! I just said! Hizamaru!

191
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:26,083
[SHISHIOU] Hey! Wow, we
got some new recruits?

192
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,708
I'm Shishiou.

193
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,958
I'm Minamoto no Yorimasa's sword
in case you didn't know that.

194
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,833
[HIGEKIRI] Ah, the one
who slayed a Nue, right?

195
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,416
[SHISHIOU] I'm glad we've got
more Minamoto swords now!

196
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,333
[YAMANBAGIRI] I told you
not to run off, didn't I?

197
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,125
Kashuu, you got a sec?

198
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,083
[KASHUU]
For what?

199
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,125
It's an order from the master.

200
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,125
From now on,
you're responsible for the care

201
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:49,000
of all new Sword Warriors
who appear at the Citadel.

202
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,666
The end.

203
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,375
Huh? Like seriously?

204
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,125
[AKITA] Well...
I'll leave it to you then.

205
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,875
All right. Seems easy.

206
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,208
Oh, Nikkari.

207
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,458
That would be me.

208
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:05,791
There something you need?

209
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,083
Apparently, we're celebrating
New Year's today.

210
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,750
They asked me if I could
possibly say a little prayer.

211
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,375
Ah. Well you're a
sacred sword, aren't you?

212
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,916
[ISHIKIRIMARU] Sure, but this
time it's nothing formal.

213
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Then try letting loose for once.

214
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,250
No pressure, right?

215
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,666
Have fun with it.

216
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,291
Well, I was wondering
if you might join me.

217
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,916
Sounds Interesting.

218
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,041
But remember, I was used
to kill a child,

219
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,833
even if it was
only a ghost.

220
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,708
So don't you think it
would probably be better

221
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,291
for you to perform
the prayer alone

222
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,958
since you're the sacred sword?

223
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,458
Up next, we have--[grunts]

224
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,541
[ISHIKIRIMARU]
I'm sorry! Are you all right?

225
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,041
[KASHUU]
Yeah, I'm fine.

226
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,750
I got distracted.
It was my fault.

227
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,250
You need something?

228
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,333
Sort of.

229
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,166
Before I ran into you,
I asked Nikkari

230
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,000
if he would do the
New Year's prayer with me,

231
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,333
but he refused.

232
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:23,000
That isn't a problem, but...

233
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,125
I believe it may have
been because of an incident

234
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,750
in the past when
the master was sick

235
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,500
and I performed a purification.

236
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,625
[NIKKARI]
Did your ritual work out?

237
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,083
[ISHIKIRIMARU]
Yes. At least, I hope.

238
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,333
I wish I could
perform purifications.

239
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:39,000
I feel helpless when the
Master falls ill like this.

240
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,708
Don't feel bad--
everyone has things

241
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,916
they can and can't do.

242
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,041
And you're saying I can't
become a sacred sword?

243
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,291
Even if it was a ghost,

244
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,291
you were used
to cut down a child.

245
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,041
I had a feeling you'd say that.

246
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,500
Don't lose hope!

247
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,875
In another hundred years,
who knows what could happen.

248
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,416
I fear I may have hurt
his feelings back then.

249
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,500
[KASHUU]
I see. I wouldn't worry.

250
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,458
I've been at the Citadel
for a while now,

251
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,083
so take it from me.

252
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,791
Sometimes Nikkari
isn't honest with himself.

253
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:11,750
Ask him again.

254
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,291
Maybe he'll agree this time,

255
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,916
or perhaps he'll tell
you how he feels.

256
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,083
Good idea.

257
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,833
There's no harm in trying again!

258
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,708
Now, let's continue
the tour, shall we?

259
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,666
Don't be rude!

260
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,750
[NIKKARI]
I told you, it's a bad idea.

261
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,583
[ISHIKIRIMARU] I'm not
forcing you to do anything,

262
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,375
but I fear I may have
hurt your feelings

263
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,833
a while back when
I implied that you

264
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,250
couldn't become a sacred sword.

265
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,541
I had hoped that this might
help make amends for that,

266
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,416
even if it's just for fun.

267
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,250
If you say so.

268
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,541
Personally, I wouldn't
worry about it.

269
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,250
Then again, I've been a sword
for over a thousand years.

270
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,708
By this point,
pretty much everything

271
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,416
just washes off my back.

272
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,500
I've killed people and ghosts
and everything, myself.

273
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:53,166
You might as well
give it a shot.

274
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,666
Well, since you brought
a whole crew here

275
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,875
to convince me.

276
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,583
Oh! But I would at least
need proper clothes,

277
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,000
wouldn't I?

278
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,791
I can't very well lead the
prayer in a track jacket.

279
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,625
[KASHUU]
We have a kimono.

280
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,750
Or Yasusada does, at least.

281
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,583
He won't be needing it.

282
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,375
It may not be the
right color for this,

283
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,458
but I trust you won't complain.

284
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,291
We should air it out anyway.

285
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,625
I'll have to thank
Yasusada when he returns.

286
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,000
[door opens]

287
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,333
Not bad! Beats the track jacket!

288
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:26,791
Ignore him. It's great.

289
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,625
I suppose you'd
know better than me,

290
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,833
but are you sure that
Yasusada wouldn't mind?

291
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,083
He can be quite picky.

292
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,000
It's not every day
we get to celebrate.

293
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,666
He can deal with it.

294
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,000
Though he might be a bit jealous

295
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,625
that his clothes got
to party instead of him.

296
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,208
You may pretend to be aloof,

297
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:44,166
but you really are quite
considerate, aren't you?

298
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,416
No one at the Citadel
knows more than you,

299
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,125
and no one is more reliable.

300
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,375
We'd better practice.

301
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,333
I trust you can train me
properly before tonight?

302
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,625
I don't want to embarrass
myself out there.

303
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:56,750
[ISHIKIRIMARU]
You can count on me.

304
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,583
[YAMANBAGIRI]
Hey, Kashuu.

305
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,958
Dispatch orders.
Gather in front of the gate.

306
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,291
[SHISHIOU]
What's up?

307
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,666
Got a mission on your
first day here, huh?

308
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,500
Well, I'll show you the ropes.

309
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,333
Is that a demon
on your shoulder?

310
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:19,125
Man or monster, my blade
will not falter an inch.

311
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,166
[HIZAMARU]
Careful, Brother.

312
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,000
Looks like it may bite.

313
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,583
It will not!

314
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:27,083
Unlike the Nue my old man
killed, this one is nice.

315
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,875
In fact, he's like my partner.

316
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,125
[HIGEKIRI]
Interesting.

317
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,958
As I'm certain all
of you have heard,

318
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,000
our enemy, the History
Retrograde Army,

319
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,250
has appeared once more.

320
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,583
Are they doing this on purpose?

321
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,458
Don't they know we're
having a party today?

322
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:39,958
They are bad guys.

323
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:43,708
[HASEBE] Your destination
is the year 1221, Sunomata.

324
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,250
The Joukyuu War, then.

325
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,416
That's correct.

326
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,000
The Emperor, Go-Toba,

327
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,541
is attempting to subjugate
Houjou Yoshitoki,

328
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,583
regent of the
Kamakura shogunate.

329
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,833
Make sure that he fails.

330
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,833
The team is as follows.

331
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,708
Kashuu Kiyomitsu,
Akashi Kuniyuki,

332
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:03,583
Hotarumaru, Higekiri,
Hizamaru, and Shishiou.

333
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,000
The Captain is Hizamaru.

334
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,916
[HIZAMARU]
Uh... Wait a second!

335
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,333
My brother should be
the leader--he's older!

336
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,458
Don't worry.

337
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,041
It's not like I resent you.

338
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,166
I'm not gonna kill
you in your sleep.

339
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,458
Uh, thank you?

340
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,250
Very gracious of you.

341
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,958
Let me continue.

342
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,166
We can assume that
the enemy wants Houjou

343
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,583
to lose the war.

344
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,500
Therefore, their target
will most likely be

345
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:25,958
the shogunate's army.

346
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,458
I've been to Sunomata
a few times now.

347
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:31,125
The enemies that show up
there can be pretty tough.

348
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:31,958
Stay safe.

349
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:34,375
So Higekiri and Hizamaru.

350
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,458
These are from our Master.

351
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,541
The rest of the team
doesn't get them?

352
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,083
There's only two to give out.
It's fine.

353
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,083
I still have mine
from last time.

354
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,166
Well, if you're ready, let's go.

355
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:52,958
[HIGEKIRI]
What's this weird machine?

356
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,875
[KASHUU] It transports us
to whatever point in time

357
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,250
we need for our mission.

358
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,500
And that's the only time
we're allowed to touch it.

359
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,041
So don't get any wild ideas.

360
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,500
Wouldn't dream of it.

361
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:02,791
Anything else?

362
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,833
Do you have your portable
space-time transport

363
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,083
device with you?

364
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,125
[HIGEKIRI]
This here?

365
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,333
[KASHUU]
Yep.

366
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,791
You won't be able to
return to the Citadel

367
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,500
without one, so don't lose it.

368
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,291
Guard it with your life, okay?

369
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:16,500
[KASHUU]
All set.

370
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,708
Give it your best,
and good luck.

371
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,083
We'll await your return.

372
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,458
[HIGEKIRI] The Minamoto clan
started as a royal family.

373
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,666
How did they end up
fighting the Imperial Court?

374
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,458
They fought amongst
themselves, too.

375
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,375
Whether it's politics or
influence or power,

376
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,041
this always happens.

377
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,125
I'm surprised you don't have
a higher opinion of them,

378
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,416
seeing as you're one of
their treasured swords.

379
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,541
This is a different
branch than I came from,

380
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,541
and besides, if you want to
get technical, then we--

381
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,458
Okay, okay, whatever
the story is, I don't care.

382
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:00,750
Long live our clan!

383
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:01,750
That's the point.

384
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,625
What? No!

385
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:06,250
Never mind all that.
Have you located the enemy?

386
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,416
Uh, yes.

387
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,541
[KASHUU]
Hiding in the forest, huh?

388
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:14,500
What's the plan?

389
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,750
Pincer movement.

390
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,291
That should do the trick.

391
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,166
[KASHUU]
Hey, ugly!

[SHISHIOU chuckles]
You're wide open!

394
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,250
This battle is life or death.

395
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,416
I suppose I can't be
lazy all the time.

396
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,791
See what happens when I try?

Not bad for new recruits!

Kashuu's team is
cleaning up the last one.

The forest here is
pretty thick, though.

00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:18,750
[MIKAZUKI]
May I join you?

478
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:21,791
[KASHUU]
Uh, sure.

479
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,541
[MIKAZUKI] Are you lonely
without Yamatonokami here?

480
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:27,916
Not especially.

481
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,541
Things have just gone
back to way they were

482
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,458
before he came.

483
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:36,375
I guess, if anything, I miss
competing with him a bit.

484
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,791
I'm sure he'll return
from his journey stronger,

485
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,083
with a wealth of
new experiences

486
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:44,083
and new memories
to fill his heart.

487
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:47,208
However, there are surely
things you can only find here

488
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,208
that will strengthen
you as well.

489
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,250
This is a gathering place
of people who have come

490
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:55,291
from all across time, from
many different backgrounds.

491
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:58,500
By spending time with them
and listening to their tales,

492
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,541
you will find priceless
things in this world

493
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,000
that you could never
experience alone.

494
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,750
The more one learns
about others,

495
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,125
the more one learns
about themselves.

496
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,625
And by looking within,
one can find a path

497
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:12,458
to strength that exists
nowhere else in the world.

498
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,625
You can still compete
with Yamatonokami.

499
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:18,958
Maybe.

500
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,416
[MIKAZUKI]
So, let's celebrate.

501
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,958
It's a new year of learning
and growing stronger

502
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,125
with our friends.

503
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:30,500
[KASHUU]
Growing stronger? I'll try.
