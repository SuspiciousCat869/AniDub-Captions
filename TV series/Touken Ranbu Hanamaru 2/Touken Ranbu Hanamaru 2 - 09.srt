[TAROUTACHI] Your pajamas simply
could not contain my enormity.

If I didn't want 'em

When I was a blade,

86
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:22,208
I was far too large to be
wielded by any human.

87

So instead, I was
dedicated to the gods.

For a sword, never seeing combat
is a fate worse than death.

It's as if I never existed.

Why was I made like this?

It's sweltering out here

164
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,708
and you two are
drinking hot tea?

165
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,375
Warm tea on a warm day
has a certain elegance to it,

166
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,666
if you ask me.

167
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:48,666
[KOGITSUNEMARU]
Ooh!

168
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,958
I think it's even
hotter in here.

169
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,791
Hey! The room's all full!

170
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,708
Nice! I think we might
have enough to play!

171
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,208
What're you talking about?

172
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,791
[MUTSUNOKAMI] I got a way
for us to spar and stay cool.

173
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,333
Come with me! It'll be fun!

174
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,166
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
All right!

175
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,875
Now let's split into teams
and get this battle underway.

176
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,416
What kind of battle, exactly?

177
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,791
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
A brand-new kind!

178
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,416
And one that doesn't use swords.

179
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,625
Today, we'll be fighting...
with these here!

180
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,208
You've lost it.

181
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,583
[MUTSUNOKAMI] No, look! I dug
these out of the master's stuff!

182
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,000
[gun cocks]

183
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,166
That's cold!

184
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,875
What kind of weapon
is that thing?

185
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,125
[MUTSUNOKAMI laughs]

186
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,833
A gun that shoots
water instead of bullets.

187
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,000
That sounds like a blast!
I'm in!

188
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,875
Hand me a gun
and I'm ready to go!

189
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:35,958
I'll pass.

190
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,375
It's not really my style.

191
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,916
That's no fun!

192
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,750
Can't use your precious sword
so you give up right away?

193
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,416
You're just afraid
you might lose, huh?

194
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,541
What did you say?

195
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,625
Well, damn.

196
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:59,958
I'm not afraid of anything,
and I'm not gonna lose, either.

197
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,750
So let's do this thing!

198
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,375
That's better!

199
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,208
Now, if you're game,
draw one of these

200
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,583
to decide your team!

201
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,250
It's on!

202
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,000
There is no way we're
losing this thing.

203
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,750
If you think you can
beat me in a gunfight,

204
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:16,916
you're crazy.

205
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,916
[HORIKAWA]
I guess we're enemies now, Kane.

206
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,458
Never thought this would happen.

207
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,375
[KANESADA] Sorry if you get
wrecked, but I'm going all out.

208
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:25,958
And you'd better do the same!

209
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,708
You bet I will.

210
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,958
You can't defeat
a true masterpiece.

211
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,041
Trust me.

212
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,041
This is no duel,
it's all-out war!

213
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,125
[NAGASONE]
Feelings. Family.

214
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:39,583
These sort of things have
no meaning on the battlefield.

215
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,375
Sorry, but you're done!

216
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,583
[YAMANBAGIRI] You won't
get one drop on my cloak.

217
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,875
Hey, wait, how do you
decide the winner?

218
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,875
If you get sprayed with water
even a little, then you're out.

219
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,625
We fight till one
team loses everyone.

220
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,583
Battle begins in five minutes.

221
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,958
Are you ready?
'Cause there's no turning back!

222
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,833
[ALL]
Yeah!

223
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,250
[NAGASONE] The other team
is tough; this won't be easy.

224
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,708
[YAMANBAGIRI] In that case,
we'll have to outsmart them.

225
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,625
Kashuu, do you have a
plan that might help us?

226
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,000
But of course.

227
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,333
The key to victory lies
in taking your opponent

228
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,250
by surprise.

229
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,416
An ambush?

230
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,041
Secret weapons.

231
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,500
No way they'll see this coming.

232
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,708
It's a bit crude, I must admit,

233
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,333
but this would appear
to be a showdown

234
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,500
where anything goes.

235
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,500
Now you're finally getting it!

236
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,916
[KASHUU]
And thus, in sweltering heat,

237
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,625
a battle without honor
and humanity began.

238
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,416
[URASHIMA]
Hachisuka, over there!

239
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,166
Yamanbagiri.

240
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,583
All right.

241
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,416
Let's move in and surround
him before he notices us.

242
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,875
We've been had!

243
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,583
[HACHISUKA yells]

244
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,416
[URASHIMA]
Hachisuka! No...

245
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,166
Forget about me.

246
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,500
Save yourself.

247
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:05,416
You're my brother.
I can't just leave you to die!

248
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,958
It's too late.

249
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,083
I'm already dead.

250
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,291
Hachisuka, no!

251
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,875
Who could do such a thing?

252
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,250
It can't be!

253
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,583
You were finally getting
along and now this?

254
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,125
I told you, family
has no meaning here.

255
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,000
[KASHUU] This'll be easier
than I thought.

256
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,833
Sorry, but you're in
the real world now, kid.

257
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,375
You adapt, or you get
gunned down like a chump.

258
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,416
[HACHISUKA]
Ch-Cheater--

259
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,583
"Cheater"? Really?
There are no rules anymore.

260
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,250
Look out! Above you!

261
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,208
[KASHUU]
What?!

262
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,041
Water balloons?

263
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,125
Sucks to be on the
receiving end, I know,

264
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,208
but like you said,
there are no rules!

265
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,416
Here I go!

266
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,791
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
Take that!

267
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,916
[KASHUU]
I hate it! Stop it!

268
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,208
I'll cover you guys!

269
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,291
But we gotta go!

270
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,333
Get up!
We don't have much time!

271
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,458
I hear you!

272
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,666
How did it come to this?

273
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,375
Don't get cocky.

274
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,375
No matter what weapon you use,

275
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,500
I'll win this.

276
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,875
Oh, will you?

277
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,750
Why don't we test
that right now?

278
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,125
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
They're a lot more resourceful

279
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,458
than I thought they'd be.

280
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,208
We're teaming up and the
master didn't even have to

281
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,083
order us this time. Wow.

282
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,541
We drew lots for the teams.
What am I supposed to say?

283
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,666
Hey. What's gotten into you?

284
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,708
[KANESADA]
Can't hide from me!

285
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,958
[KANESADA] You too scared to
fight face-to-face or what?

286
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:08,583
Urashima?

287
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,625
[NAGASONE gasps]

288
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,250
[URASHIMA]
Nagasone.

289
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:20,291
Please, don't make
me pull this trigger.

290
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,416
[NAGASONE]
Shoot me.

291
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,708
Take your revenge.

292
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,291
I've already lost one brother
today. Isn't that enough?

293
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,000
[NAGASONE]
Shoot!

294
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,583
[URASHIMA gasps]

295
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:29,791
[NAGASONE] I was prepared for
this the moment I picked up

296
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:30,916
my gun.

297
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,750
I knew the stakes.

298
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,833
This isn't some game.

299
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,958
What're you even saying?
You're scaring me!

300
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,375
[NAGASONE]
Listen up!

301
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:41,666
This is a battle with
your pride on the line.

302
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,791
So fight!

303
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,625
This isn't such a bad way to go.

304
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:48,875
I have no regrets.

305

[MUTSUNOKAMI]
You may be a copy,

308
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,833
but at least this time
I know you're not a fake!

309
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,541
Careful there! Ha!

310
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:20,291
Sorry, it looks like the
gods are on my side today.

311
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,250
I've got enough left
for one good shot.

312
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,291
[YAMANBAGIRI]
Is that so?

313
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,250
Then tell me,
where are your gods now?

314

[MUTSUNOKAMI]
What?!

[yelling]

316
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,791
[YAMANBAGIRI]
It's fine to trust yourself,

317
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,625
but don't underestimate
your enemy.

318

[MUTSUNOKAMI grunts]

319
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,750
[KASHUU] Okay, we've got you,
me and Horikawa.

320
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:48,083
The other side is down to
Kanesada and Urashima.

321
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,833
I think we're in
the home stretch.

322
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:52,083
[URASHIMA] I wouldn't be
so sure if I were you.

323
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,416
He's hardcore. Whoa.

324
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
This isn't the Urashima
you know and love.

325
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:09,291
It's a man who just lost
two of his brothers.

326
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,083
His heart and soul have
been tempered like steel.

327
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:16,416
His conviction forged anew
in the flames of battle!

328
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,875
[URASHIMA]
Hachisuka. Nagasone.

329
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,333
[KANESADA] Some warriors
are crippled by sorrow,

330
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,708
but those who overcome it

331
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,791
become stronger than ever!

332
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,166
Line up!

333
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,291
I'm sending you all
straight to hell!

334
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,875
[yelling]

335
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:31,916
Damn it!

336
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,083
[YAMANBAGIRI]
He's too fast! I can't hit him!

337
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,666
Not my cloak. No...

338
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,166
There's only one thing to do.

339
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,500
Tactical retreat!

340
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:54,708
[URASHIMA]
Get back here!

341
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,083
[rustling]

342
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,291
[KANESADA]
So there you are.

343
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,458
[HORIKAWA] Let's settle
this, once and for all.

344
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,041
Say goodbye!

345
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,000
[KANESADA] How do you expect
to beat me if all you do

346
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,083
is run away?

347
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:20,958
Fine! How's this?

348
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,958
[HORIKAWA] I knew he'd
give me a good fight!

349
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,291
[KANESADA]
Now this is fun!

350
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,083
[KANESADA]
Crap, where'd he go?

351
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,833
[KANESADA]
They've got a sniper! But who?

352
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:41,875
[UGUISUMARU]
Ow!

353
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:43,875
[KANESADA]
Gotcha!

354
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,458
[KANESADA]
Uguisumaru?

355
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:51,125
What were you doing
hanging out up in a tree?

356
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,458
[UGUISUMARU]
What else?

357
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,666
I was watching Ookanehira
from a safe distance.

358
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,791
[rustling]

359
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,583
[HORIKAWA]
Prepare yourself, Kane!

360
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,208
[KANESADA]
I'm getting dizzy!

361
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,250
[KANESADA]
Heh!

362
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,000
[UGUISUMARU]
What did I do wrong?

363
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,875
I'm sorry, I didn't see you--

364
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,041
[KANESADA]
This is a battlefield, remember.

365
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:13,708
Wow, Kane.

366
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,541
You really are the best,
aren't you?

367
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,041
[HASEBE]
What the heck? Come back!

368
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,250
[URASHIMA] Just let me
spray you already! Jeez!

369
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,666
[HASEBE] Whatever you're
doing, stop it immediately!

370
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,125
Akashi!

371
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,500
Hey, there.
Did ya need something?

372
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:41,791
Wait, what are you doing?

373
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,125
No mercy!

374
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,000
[URASHIMA]
Hey, stop!

375
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,000
Kashuu!

376
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,708
You're the last one
left, y'know!

377
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,166
Are you kidding me?

378
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,166
I thought Horikawa had this!

379
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,208
What d'you think?

380
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,916
Should we make even more stilts?

381
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,625
For everyone, huh?

382
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:03,708
Whoa! Kashuu?

383
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,291
[KASHUU]
Later! I'm busy!

384
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,500
[GOTOU]
Huh?

385
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:14,833
[KANESADA]
Over there!

386
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,875
[URASHIMA]
Hey! Where'd he go?

387
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,250
This doesn't make sense!

388
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,458
[KASHUU]
Try looking up.

389
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,333
Now say goodbye!

390
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,291
[KANESADA, URASHIMA yell]

391
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,291
[KANESADA]
Man!

392
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,458
And I thought we had
that one for sure!

393
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,333
[URASHIMA] You were
outnumbered and everything!

394
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,583
[KASHUU]
I've been here the longest,

395
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,416
so I know a trick or two.

396
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,666
[KANESADA]
Come to think of it,

397
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,541
you were pulling tricks
on us that whole match.

398
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,791
My favorite was
the fake Yamanbagiri!

399
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,166
I would've fallen
for that one, too!

400
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,833
You don't have to humor me.

401
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,916
Tricks or not, congrats on
the big comeback, Kashuu.

402
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
[clapping]

403
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,000
I wish Yasusada
had been there to see!

404
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,500
He'd love this!

405
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,166
[URASHIMA laughs]

406
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,916
Now. I present to you
this invisible certificate.

407
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,041
Celebrating your excellence
in water pistol trickery

408
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:09,791
and balloon dodging
under pressure.

409
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,625
Truly admirable work.

410
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,625
I'm sure it'll look
perfect on your wall.

411
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:17,916
Ha-ha!

412
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,291
I'm so proud.

413
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:22,208
[GROUP laughing]

414
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:26,083
[KASHUU]
I'm finally done.

415
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:30,833
[KASHUU] We might have
to have a water gun duel

416
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,666
when you get back, Yasusada.
