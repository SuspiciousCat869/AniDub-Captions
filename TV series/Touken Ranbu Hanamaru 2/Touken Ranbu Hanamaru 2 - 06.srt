[SOUZA]
What kind of seeds are those?

29
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,000
They're for an
herb called lavender.

30
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:59,166
The flower's scent has a calming
effect and can reduce anxiety.

That sounds quite
useful, actually.

00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,708
I'll exert my every muscle

33

I think I might like to plant
some lavender seeds, myself.

That's fine, of course,
but did something happen?

The tale of his life
is a tale of vengeance.

42
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:33,041
His former master
was killed by bandits,

43
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,458
and her son used
him to take revenge.

44
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,000
Surely those thoughts
haunt him even to this day.

I'm sorry. I had no clue.

It's fine, but I worry,

47
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,958
and I want to help him
in every way that I can.

48
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,333
Frankly, anything's worth a try.

He would?

He showed an interest
when Kousetsu first appeared.

Oh, hello, Sayo.

What is it?

00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,583
That flower. Can you tell
me where you got it from?

56
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,583
I know someone
who might like one.

[KASEN]
Sure.

If you walk past the fields,
you'll see these

all along the path.

00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,666
That sounds easy enough.

I hope they like them.

64
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,958
I'd forgotten, but the
talk about planting lavender

65
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,375
reminded me of it.

66
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,625
I don't see any reason
why that wouldn't work.

67
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:35,125
Caring for a flowerbed might
also put Sayo's mind at ease.

68
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,625
That's a lovely idea.

69
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,333
I'll tell Sayo and Kousetsu
so we can plant it together

70
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,583
as a family.

71
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,708
In that case, why don't
you use the empty field

72
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:43,625
over there?

73
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,208
We have plenty of room.

74
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,208
I have some flower seeds
I use for medicine,

75
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,375
so you can start
with those, if you like.

76
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,583
Okay, great, then leave
the design to me.

77
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,958
I've known Sayo since we
were with Lord Hosokawa,

78
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,791
so I would like to help too.

00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,708
That's very kind of you.

Just a few drops of this and

A word of warning, though,
it's still in the testing phase.

don't you, Sayo?

I don't know.

97
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:18,250
But when I gave a
flower to Kousetsu,

98
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,625
it seemed to make
him happy, at least.

00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:21,708
That's good.

100

[KOUSETSU] It appears we'll
have to wait a while longer.

101
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,458
Even with Yagen's
fertilizer, there's a limit.

102
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,333
We can't expect them
to just sprout overnight.

103

He went out on an expedition.

162
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:21,791
Pretty.

163
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,041
[KOUSETSU]
Sayo.

164
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,083
What is it that you're
feeling in your heart?

165
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,458
Is it still revenge
that you long for?

166
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,250
I don't want to upset you.

167
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:35,250
I know that you don't
like violence, but I--

168
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:38,250
Don't worry, it's not
my place to judge.

169
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,333
If vengeance is a part of you,
then I must accept that.

170
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,958
I love you for
who you are, Sayo.

171
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,166
[SOUZA]
However...

172
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,041
We know that you've
been troubled lately.

173
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,416
So I sincerely hope when
you spend time out here,

174
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,791
you find some peace.

175
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,000
Maybe.

176
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,125
There's a voice in my
heart that's always crying

177
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,083
for vengeance, but this time,

178
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,291
when I was planting
flowers with everyone,

179
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,875
it was more like a whisper.

180
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,041
Like I could forget
it was there for a while.

181
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:08,333
Either way, we all got to work
on something together.

182
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,041
So I'm happy.

183
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,708
As long as you're happy,

184
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,333
then your brothers
are happy, too.

185
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,458
Okay, I think it's on now.

186
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:42,666
[clears throat]

187
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:47,041
So, in case you haven't
noticed... [laughs]

188
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,333
...the citadel just
got a makeover!

189
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,458
[GROUP chattering]

190
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,583
[KASHUU] Listen up.
A new brother is here.

191
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,125
Gotou Toshiro is here at last!

192
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,791
And I'm getting
bigger every day!

193
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,875
Hey, Gotou! It's been a while!

194
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,625
Namazuo!
It's good to see you again!

195
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,000
This should be fun!

196
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,333
My name's Shinano Toushirou.

197
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,250
I was considered a treasure,
even amongst my brothers.

198
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,250
They say.

199
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,916
I'm a treasure too!

200
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,708
Anyway, it's getting a bit late.

201
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,416
We'll finish the
tour tomorrow, okay?

202
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,666
--[GOTOU] That's cool.
--[SHINANO] Works for me.

203
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,666
Well... Good night, you guys.

204
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:29,000
I was told I had a lot of
brothers here, but holy cow.

205
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,750
[GOTOU] Yeah, looks like space
is at a premium, huh?

206
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,500
Let's just squeeze
in tight for now

207
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,083
and we'll figure out
something tomorrow.

208
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,791
[yawning]

209
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,458
Didn't get much sleep, or what?

210
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,458
Yeah, 'cause we're
packed in like sardines.

211
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,041
Now, don't get me wrong.

212
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,166
I'm happy we have
so many brothers,

213
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,125
but we're at
the limit here.

214
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,125
[HONEBAMI]
Maybe.

215
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,708
I don't want to
split up, though.

216
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,458
[NAMAZUO]
We just need a bigger room.

217
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,708
Guess it's inevitable
with all the new recruits

218
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,791
we've been getting.

219
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,875
We don't even have room
for all the dishes anymore.

220
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,125
[OTEGINE] Also, the line for the
bathroom in the morning

221
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,291
is getting pretty intense.

222
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,125
[NAMAZUO] Can't they build
us a new citadel?

223
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,125
Our job's pretty important.

224
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,791
Protecting history
doesn't bring in much money.

225
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,458
Did someone say "money?"

226
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,208
Where did you find all of that?

227
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,250
[OTEGINE] Wait, that must be the
hidden treasure we found

228
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,291
in Osaka Castle a while back.

229
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,958
I don't remember it being
quite that much gold, though.

230
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,791
After consulting with
the master and Hasebe,

231
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,750
I decided to invest our
hard-earned funds

232
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,541
in the stock market.

233
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,458
I'm pleased to announce that
we just reached our goal!

234
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,291
Way to go, Hakata!

235
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:43,416
[HAKATA] Now I can share a
room with Ichi and Nakigitsune!

236
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,750
Without being tight as a roll
of coins, that is. [laughs]

237
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,583
I'm gonna tell the
master right away!

238
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,000
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
The old citadel was nice,

239
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,250
but this is a masterpiece.

240
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,666
[KASHUU]
What are you up to?

241
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,083
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
Hey, good timing!

242
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,041
I'm recording a live tour
of the new citadel

243
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,000
with my video camera here.

244
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,875
The Master is always
holed up in their room,

245
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,500
so I hate for them to miss out
on all the fresh sights

246
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,916
and smiling faces.

247
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,541
Wait, are you
already filming me?

248
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,541
Master! Hi, there!

249
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,916
You wanna tag
along for the show?

250
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,166
[KASHUU]
Can I?

251
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,458
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
Yeah, but you gotta be the MC.

252
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,875
[KASHUU]
Uh...

253
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,250
[MUTSUNOKAMI] All right!
Let's get this party started!

254
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,958
Well, first off,
this is the entryway.

255
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:27,791
[JUZUMARU]
Ha!

256
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,666
[KASHUU, MUTSUNOKAMI gasp]

257
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,291
Ah. I didn't mean
to startle you.

258
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,208
You must forgive me.

259
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,708
[MUTSUNOKAMI] Sure, but what
the heck are you doing in here?

260
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,083
Performing a purification
ritual, of course.

261
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,208
It's a brand-new
citadel, after all.

262
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:48,541
We wouldn't want it infested
with any "visitors," right?

263
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,166
No, of course not.

264
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,583
Moving on, let's take
a look in here!

265
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,583
Welcome to our room!

266
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,208
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
Nice and big this time!

267
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,875
So what's it like
living in here?

268
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,208
[GROUP]
We love it!

269
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,875
The old room was
too crowded to share

270
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,875
with our big brothers,
but now, you're here!

271
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,583
I'm glad it all worked out.

272
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,541
Thanks to your
financial knowhow.

273
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:10,708
Excellent work!

274
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,916
[HAKATA chuckles]
This is just the start.

275
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,166
I've still got plenty
of stocks to watch.

276
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,166
[ICHIGO] Heh. As long as you
don't neglect your training.

277
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,916
Check out the exciting
features in our new hangout!

278
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,958
This is our comfy couch
where we sit and chat!

279
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,875
As you can see, it's roomy, too!

280
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:31,416
But the best seat in the
house is still right here.

281
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,375
We've got plenty of space,
even when we drag

282
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,458
all of our bedding out.

283
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,916
I can finally rest in peace.

284
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,250
[GOKOTAI]
E-Excuse me.

285
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,375
[KASHUU]
Uh-huh?

286
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,208
It really is a nice
place to hang out.

287
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:45,541
So I hope the master comes
here someday to play with us.

288
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,416
We can fold some
origami together if you like!

289
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,333
I've got some tea
I'd love to share!

290
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,458
We can stay up
and talk all night!

291
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,166
[NAKIGITSUNE (FOX)] One visit
and you'll be convinced!

292
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,833
You'll wanna come
back every day!

293
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,500
You're welcome here any time.

294
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,583
[ICHIGO]
C'mon, guys.

295
00:16:58,666 --> 00:16:59,833
I think that's enough.

296
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,750
Mutsunokami is touring
the whole citadel.

297
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,125
We shouldn't keep him.

298
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,750
That said, I do hope you
consider our offer, Master.

299
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,000
We'd be delighted to have you.

300
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,916
Come visit soon!

301
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,500
[AKASHI snoring]

302
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:14,791
Yoo-hoo!

303
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,166
This is the Aizen Zone.
Check it out!

304
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,583
Anything special in here
you'd like to show off?

305
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,625
Yeah, you're totally
gonna love this.

306
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,750
We got this attic to use
like a secret hideout!

307
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,416
Plenty of light, too.

308
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,208
It's just perfect!

309
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:29,625
Kuniyuki, they're filming us.

310
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,208
Would ya get out of bed already?

311
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,166
[AIZEN]
Are you ignoring me?

312
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,625
Smile for the camera,
then you can nap more.

313
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:38,958
Come on, please!

314
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,625
Okay, okay, you
can sleep with me.

315
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,000
[HOTARUMARU]
I said smile for the camera!

316
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,708
Wow. Is this kinda
thing normal for them?

317
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,750
Well, uh, it is, yeah, kinda.

318
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,083
Please stop him.

319
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:56,125
Hotaru, I think that's enough!

320
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,750
[TAIKOGANE]
How 'bout this one?

321
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,875
[TSURUMARU]
Yeah, that looks nice!

322
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,041
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
Whoa.

323
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,041
Is this place classy or what?

324
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,875
It's Shokudaikiri's
and Taikogane's room,

325
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,750
so that does makes sense.

326
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,208
[KASHUU]
Um, hey guys.

327
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,125
Hey!

328
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,791
[KASHUU]
What's with the outfit?

329
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,166
It's something Tsuru and I
picked up at the general store

330
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,541
the other day.

331
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,250
They had all sorts
of crazy clothes!

332
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,000
Seemed like the kinda
stuff that would look cool

333
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,500
on Mitsu and Kara,
so we bought a bunch!

334
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,166
How 'bout we do a
fashion show and you guys

335
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,333
can be the judges?

336
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:25,291
Sounds like fun.

337
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,958
Let the fashion begin!

338
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,375
We got an audience,
Kara, you gotta do it!

339
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,416
You can't make me do anything.

340
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,916
Come on, I promise
they will love you!

341
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,625
I don't need to make friends.

342
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,166
[KASHUU]
That looks pretty slick to me.

343
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,291
[MUTSUNOKAMI] Yeah, but
they should look like fighters!

344
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,333
[TSURUMARU] Then mix it up
with something cute!

345
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,083
Haven't you made me
suffer enough?

346
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,833
Just one more, it'll be good!

347
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,791
[GROUP]
Whoa!

348
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:53,708
[KASHUU]
That's perfect!

349
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,291
It's a classic look!

350
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,041
Quite befitting of a sword!

351
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,541
I know!

352
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,541
[KASHUU] Let's get a quote
from our two talented models.

353
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,291
Please don't talk to me anymore.

354
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,208
I don't think I'd like
to dress up every day,

355
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,250
but it was fun for a change.

356
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,791
And how do you
two think it went?

357
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,000
They looked awesome and
I didn't have to do a thing,

358
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,166
so it worked out great for me!

359
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,541
Same here.

360
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,500
And you know me, I'm always
up for something new!

361
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,708
[TAIKOGANE] How 'bout I pick
out clothes for you next time?

362
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,375
[KASHUU]
I'm looking forward to it.

363
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:18,083
[MUTSUNOKAMI] Next up is
Yamatonokami and Kashuu's room!

364
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,125
Right here.

365
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,875
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
What is this?

366
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,541
[KASHUU]
A hair pin.

367
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,333
Yasusuda broke it last year.

368
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,958
I'm going to fix it, and add
on a couple of cute details.

369
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,750
Sounds like you!

370
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:33,791
But I'm surprised!

371
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,208
Your room's a little... low-key.

372
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,375
That's because my
roommate isn't here.

373
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:41,125
When he comes back, we'll
decorate things together.

374
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,208
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
I see, that'll be nice.

375
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,916
I bet you can't wait, huh?

376
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,041
I'll cope.

377
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,041
Any place we haven't gone yet?

378
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:53,958
What's this hallway?

379
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,458
Haven't been here, myself.

380
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,333
Let's take a look.

381
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,958
[KASHUU]
Huh...

382
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:09,958
[KASHUU]
A dead end?

383
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:13,666
[BOTH gasp]

384
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,500
C'mon. Let's go.

385
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,500
[KASHUU gasps]

386
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,791
[KONNOSUKE]
Num-num!

387
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:35,166
Fried tofu, and fried tofu,
and fried tofu, and fried tofu.

388
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,583
Fried tofu hanging on the walls.

389
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,125
Fried tofu hanging
from the ceiling!

390
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:43,833
Why, even the rug is fried tofu!

391
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,958
This is a world of true beauty!

392
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,166
This is love!

393
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,500
Fried tofu is life!

394
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,291
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
I think we're done.

395
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:53,500
[KASHUU]
Yeah.

396
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:04,166
And now, a final note
from everyone to the master.

397
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,625
Master.

398
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,958
The citadel is not the only
thing that's been renewed.

399
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,791
For I have renewed
my vows to serve you

400
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:12,875
in every matter,
mundane or otherwise!

401
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,583
If you need help
decorating your room,

402
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,416
gimme a call and
I'll make it shine!

403
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,125
And I'll organize your stuff.

404
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,666
Or you can just come
to my room instead!

405
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,875
You should do
waterfall training with us.

406
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,791
We'll try a beginner's course.

407
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,333
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
Guys, the battery's low!

408
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:27,416
[TAIKOGANE]
Hurry!

409
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,625
[KASHUU]
Let's wrap it up! All together!

410
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,458
Keep up the good work, Master!
