[ICHIGO]
The year is 2205 AD.

2
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:21,166
The History Retrograde Army
seeks to control the world

3
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,666
by altering its past.

4
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,000
Born from the heart of swords,

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,500
[GROUP] We travel through time
to intercept and eliminate them.

6
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,083
Master!

7
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,750
We brought some dinner;
I hope you're hungry!

8
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:12,375
If you don't mind, we'd
be honored to eat with you.

9
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:18,416
[NAKIGITSUNE] This is the tale
of the legendary sword warriors,

10
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,708
and the Hanamaru days they
spent in a certain citadel.

11
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,958
[OTEGINE]
I got one!

12
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,666
Wow, it's big!

13
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,833
Looks good!

14
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,791
Guess you can stab fish, too!

15
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,416
Don't suppose you
could stab some saké

16
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,791
while you're at it?

17
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,125
Sorry, but I don't think
that's how it works.

18
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,083
[HOUCHOU]
This isn't funny!

19
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,833
You guys!

20
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,541
We've got serious problems
to deal with here!

21
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,875
[AKITA]
The sun feels so nice today.

22
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,458
[AIZEN] Looks like fall is
coming in slow this year.

23
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:16,166
[URASHIMA] We should go fishing
while the weather's still warm.

24
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,375
The waters should be chock full
of saury this time of year.

25
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,666
Let's do it!

26
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,333
So what's stopping us?

27
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,791
If we go alone,
everyone'll worry about us.

28
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,375
We'd have to get one
of our big brothers

29
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,416
to tag along,
but I don't know who.

30
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,041
[NIHONGOU]
Finally done!

31
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,750
[OTEGINE] I know it's just
working in the fields,

32
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,666
but that really wore me out.

33
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,916
I don't mind hard labor
as long as I can get

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,583
hard liquor when it's done,
and maybe some fish, too.

35
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:39,875
That sounds nice.

36
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,583
[HOUCHOU]
Is it so wrong to have a dream?

37
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,708
[door slams]

38
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,750
You're such a jerk, Ichi!

39
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:51,916
What the--?

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,083
[ICHIGO]
Houchou, wait!

41
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,166
[TSURUMARU]
That's a surprise!

42
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,333
You always get along so well!

43
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,125
I'm embarrassed
you had to see that.

44
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,291
Just let him cool off.

45
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm sure you guys
can work it out soon.

46
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,500
Thank you for the kind words.
I just hope you're right.

47
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,583
Looks like we'll be
having salt-grilled saury

48
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:12,541
for dinner tonight!

49
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,666
Works for me!

50
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,333
Along with some hot saké,
of course.

51
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,000
Oh, hey. Houchou!

52
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,083
Is something the matter?

53
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:24,333
Ichi's a mean old fathead,
so I'm running away from home!

54
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,083
That doesn't sound
like Ichi to me!

55
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,458
[HOUCHOU]
Hmph.

56
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,541
[URASHIMA] Never mind Ichi,
you wanna go fishing?

57
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:30,583
[HOUCHOU]
Huh?

58
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,458
We're not catching
anything! I hate this!

59
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:41,000
[URASHIMA]
Well, day's not over yet!

60
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:44,333
Besides, we've only been
at it for an hour or so.

61
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,958
[HOUCHOU] Yeah, but those two
can't even stay awake!

62
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,625
[AKITA] They wore themselves out
working in the fields.

63
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,375
Also, the weather is nice, so I
can't really blame them.

64
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,458
No joke.

65
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,375
I think I could go
for a nap myself.

66
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,250
[snoring]

67
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,333
[sneezes]

68
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,333
[HOUCHOU]
Wake up!

69
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:19,708
Where are we?!

70
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,791
[HACHISUKA] It's already morning
and they're still missing?

71
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,041
[AKASHI]
Hey, I'm worried, too,

72
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,833
but flipping out isn't
going to help find them.

73
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,208
Did you guys hear anything?

74
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,625
Are they still gone?

75
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,250
I'm afraid so.

76
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,750
[NAGASONE] We searched
up and down the beach,

77
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,375
but didn't see any sign of them.

78
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,375
[ICHIGO] My brothers
and I didn't find anything

79
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:41,708
in the mountains, either.

80
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,375
[TSURUMARU] Otegine said
he was going fishing,

81
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,375
so they should be
close to water.

82
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,166
That makes sense at least.

83
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,208
Except... I don't know
where Houchou went.

84
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,375
I'm going to keep searching.

85
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,666
Hold on, jeez.

86
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,125
You've been looking
all night. Rest for a sec.

87
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,125
Go talk with your brothers
and let us handle things

88
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,083
for a while.

89
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,125
Are you sure?

90
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,500
We just heard some good
news from the master!

91
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,958
Seems all six of the
missing swords are together.

92
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:14,083
You said there's six?
Houchou too?

93
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,041
[TONBOKIRI] Yeah.
The master says don't worry.

94
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,250
Wherever they are,
they're not hurt.

95
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,875
Oh, good.

96
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,333
[KASHUU] The master
wasn't able to determine

97
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,875
their exact location, though.

98
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,500
They said they're
not far from here,

99
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,083
but that's about
all they could tell.

100
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,625
[HACHISUKA]
I see.

101
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:28,750
Houchou was upset,

102
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,708
but I thought he would
come right back.

103
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,583
You think he's the
reason everyone's gone?

104
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:36,291
Then it'd be my fault
for scolding him so much.

105
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,500
[ICHIGO]
Houchou.

106
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:42,958
Haven't I told you already?

107
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,583
If you keep eating
those snacks all day,

108
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,083
you won't have an appetite
when it's dinner time!

109
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,500
Yeah, that's like the
only thing you talk about.

110
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,708
You know, if there was a
nice, married lady here,

111
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,916
she'd pat my head and
give me tons of snacks

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,958
and things!

113
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,416
This is the citadel!

114
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,041
There are no married women here!

115
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,250
Not ever!

116
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,916
[HOUCHOU whining]

117
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,833
In retrospect, I may have
been a little harsh with him.

118
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,333
Well, let's look
on the bright side--

119
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,333
at least we know
they're all safe now.

120
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,208
[HOTARUMARU]
Hey, look.

121
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,625
I think that might be them.

122
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,125
Kuniyuki!

123
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,416
Are you going to check?

124
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,166
[AKASHI]
Yeah, but you should stay here.

125
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,541
We don't want them coming
back to an empty citadel.

126
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,500
I guess, but you already
stayed up all night searching.

127
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,583
You're tired.

128
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,250
I'm fine. I'm always tired.

129
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,583
If you're going,
then I'm going too.

130
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,458
Count me in.

131
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,000
We don't need your help, fake.

132
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,500
I've been waiting
at the citadel,

133
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:44,125
so I'm well-rested, unlike you.

134
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,541
I promise I'll bring
our brother back safe.

135
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,250
Fair enough. Be careful.

136
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,000
You hold the fort. I'm going.

137
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,416
[TSURUMARU]
You sure?

138
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,208
If I stayed here, it's not
like I'd be able to rest.

139
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,666
I feel better doing
something about it.

140
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,541
Let me tag along, as well.

141
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,375
I'll get them home if I have
to carry them on my back.

142
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,500
All right.

143
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,208
Just make sure you
don't get lost too.

144
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,333
Oh, hey.

145
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,125
Maybe a good luck
charm would work.

146
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,458
I'd be happy to help out.

147
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,833
There's one sign
of good luck already.

148
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,500
We haven't even
left and a swallow

149
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:22,750
came to see us off!

150
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,750
[OTEGINE]
Breakfast is ready!

151
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:28,416
Here you go!

152
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,166
This trip isn't so bad at all!

153
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,166
Aw, yeah!

154
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,666
It's good, huh?

155
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,458
[HOUCHOU]
Stop having fun!

156
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:38,166
We should be looking
for a way back right now!

157
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,583
[OTEGINE]
But we're hungry, and besides,

158
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,708
we have no way of
figuring out where we are.

159
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,625
[NIHONGOU] Let the guys
at the citadel work it out.

160
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,583
They'll probably come
searching for us soon enough,

161
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,250
so we might as well have
some fun in the meantime.

162
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,083
Yeah, but it could take
them days to track us down.

163
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,500
We should search the area.

164
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,125
Maybe set up a camp?

165
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,083
Hey, Houchou.
When we're done eating,

166
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,166
why don't we build a hut
in case we get stuck here

167
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,250
another night?

168
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,583
Lame!

169
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:01,708
If you want me to work,

170
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,416
the only currencies
I accept are candy

171
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,833
and head-pats
from married women.

172
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,333
Preferably both.

173
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,916
That's all you talk about.
You gotta widen your horizons.

174
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,625
Is that why you were
fighting with Ichigo

175
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,250
over some married woman thing?

176
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,000
Ichi's not even here!
So why should you care?

177
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,333
And maybe I should stay gone

178
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,500
so he doesn't have to
scold anyone anymore.

179
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,875
I'm sure he's happy!

180
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,166
[HACHISUKA] Monoyoshi, are you
sure this is the right way?

181
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,166
[MONOYOSHI]
Uh-huh.

182
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,166
My intuition never
leads me astray!

183
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,875
[HACHISUKA]
You're absolutely sure?

184
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,208
[MONOYOSHI]
Yep. Follow me.

185
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,541
Good fortune lies just ahead.

186
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,541
[ICHIGO]
In a cave? Really?

187
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,958
[AKASHI]
Dive into the darkness.

188
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,416
Sure. Why not?

189
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
[HACHISUKA]
I had no idea this was here.

190
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,166
There's no evidence that
anyone has been this way.

191
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,583
For the last time,
are you positively sure?

192
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,875
Uh-huh! No doubt at all!

193
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,791
Not like we have
any other bright ideas.

194
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,250
Might as well do his thing.

195
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,625
Yeah, that's a good point.

196
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,208
And what's the
worst that could happen?

197
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,541
Cave monsters?

198
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,000
Okay, follow me.

199
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,583
Let's--Ahh!

200
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,291
[ALL yelling]

201
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,208
[AKITA]
The wind's getting chilly.

202
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,833
You should sit
next to the bonfire.

203
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,541
[HOUCHOU]
I'll be fine.

204
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,333
Ichi's not happy you're gone.

205
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,875
In fact, I bet he's
worried sick right now.

206
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,541
Uh, yeah, right.

207
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,208
Seems like all I ever
do is make him mad.

208
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,541
He's not mad.

209
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,541
He's just trying
to look out for you.

210
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,750
I don't blame
you for being hurt.

211
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:40,000
He's usually nicer, so it
probably feel like he hates you.

212
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,666
But he doesn't.

213
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,916
We have to fight
together as a team.

214
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,250
So I think he's worried that
you're keeping to yourself

215
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,208
too much.

216
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,625
That you're not making friends.

217
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,541
My former masters
were like that.

218
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,916
Sometimes, they'd
shut everyone out.

219
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,958
No one was there to push them.

220
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,666
So as they grew older,
they stopped learning

221
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,250
and they stopped improving, too.

222
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,250
If you don't listen to
any voice but your own,

223
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,416
you'll get lost.

224
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,500
I know this is hard,
but let's do our best

225
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,208
to make everyone proud.

226
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,041
'Cause if we have their respect,

227
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,041
we can hold our heads
high and know we're doing

228
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,500
the right thing.

229
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,083
[HOUCHOU]
'Kay, then.

230
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,375
Let's work on that hut.

231
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,541
[HOUCHOU chuckles]

232
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,041
[HACHISUKA groans]
At long last, we're free!

233
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,666
[AIZEN] Food tastes better
after a hard day's work!

234
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,000
Have to agree!

235
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,000
They taste good
'cause I caught them!

236
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,958
[HACHISUKA]
Urashima!

237
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,208
[URASHIMA]
Hachisuka, you found us!

238
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,916
You had us so worried!

239
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,125
[URASHIMA]
I'm sorry!

240
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,000
[NIHONGOU laughs]
I'm touched!

241
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,833
You brought a whole
search party!

242
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,291
Yeah!

243
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,000
But why are you all so beat up?

244
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,166
You aren't the ones
who got lost at sea.

245
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,083
Well, you don't actually
need a boat to get here.

246
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,916
We're just beyond the mountain.
But you see...

247
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,166
The path by land is
quite treacherous indeed.

248
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,958
[MONOYOSHI] It wasn't the
nicest way to make it,

249
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,166
but it was the
shortest, at least.

250
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,291
Never mind all that.
I'm just glad everyone's safe.

251
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,833
And by the way, it turns
out there's a giant cave

252
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,666
under the mountain back there.

253
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,666
I'll have to report it to
the master when we get back.

254
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,416
Come on, let's go home.

255
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,666
[AIZEN]
You gonna be okay?

256
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,875
Those bags under your
eyes look intense!

257
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,375
Don't worry,
it's just a little bit of dirt.

258
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,375
Sorry this turned
into such a mess.

259
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,083
Thank you for coming
to get me, though.

260
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,083
I'd hate to let you down.

261
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,708
[AKITA]
Hey. Don't be shy.

262
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,000
You made it!

263
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,041
[giggles]

264
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,208
I missed you.

265
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,166
I missed you too!

266
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,333
[GROUP laughs]

267
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,708
I'm sorry that I
was such a dumb jerk!

268
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,166
I'm sorry for
scolding you so much.

269
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,875
You're doing fine.

270
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,541
And, y'know,
you're still my brother,

271
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:18,750
no matter what.

272
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,833
I'll try not to make
you worry from now on.

273
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:21,833
Relax!

274
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,458
No one got hurt,
so it's all okay!

275
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,458
[ICHIGO]
In that case, let's go home.

276
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:27,791
Everyone's waiting.

277
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,708
I hope Houchou didn't
cause you any trouble.

278
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,875
He was pretty upset
when he ran away.

279
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,458
[OTEGINE]
No, he worked hard.

280
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,291
He just needed
a pep talk, that's all!

281
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:45,125
Tell him you're proud
when he wakes up, 'kay?

282
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,333
[ICHIGO]
You bet I will.

283
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,583
[URASHIMA]
Finally!

284
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,125
[OTEGINE]
I know we were only gone a day,

285
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:53,000
but I gotta admit, it sure
feels nice to be home!

286
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,791
[NIHONGOU]
Let's drink to celebrate!

287
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,791
And also to get wasted!

288
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,166
[AKASHI] I'm going to sleep
for the rest of the week.

289
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,583
[URASHIMA]
We're back, everyone!

290
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,833
[SHOKUDAIKIRI]
Here. Three miso ramens.

291
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,333
Get 'em while they're hot.

292
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,875
Wow, that looks amazing.

293
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,708
I prepared you a side as well.

294
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,666
Shrimp and chive dumplings.

295
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,666
Hope you enjoy.

296
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,291
You outdid yourself this time!

297
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:23,333
Even Oodenta will smile
when he checks these out!

298
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,000
Thank you for going
to so much trouble.

299
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,000
This looks perfect!

300
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,333
No trouble.

301
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,791
I couldn't resist making
hot ramen on a chilly day.

302
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,041
It's so nice of you to take
some lunch to your brother,

303
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,625
but I do hope we can
all eat together soon.

304
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,708
Me too.

305
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:48,166
Hope you're ready for
some hot ramen, Oodenta!

306
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,583
I'm sorry you had to
drag it all the way out

307
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:50,958
to the storage shed.

308
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,708
Instead of apologizing,
how 'bout we eat it

309
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,333
before it gets soggy?

310
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,166
I am grateful for this meal.

311
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,583
Aw, man, I could eat
this stuff every day!

312
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,000
Have you tried
the dumplings yet?

313
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,083
They're great.

314
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,833
Yeah. This is far
too good for me.

315
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,166
Listen. I hate to bug you.

316
