1
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,583
[MIKAZUKI]
The year is 2205 AD.

2
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:20,916
The History Retrograde Army
seeks to control the world

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,541
by altering its past.

4
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:27,500
[KOGITSUNEMARU]
Born from the heart of swords,

5
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:31,583
[BOTH] we travel through time
to intercept and eliminate them.

6
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,500
We've all had a rather
stimulating day today,

7
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:11,708
haven't we?

8
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:12,791
Rest well.

9
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,666
You've earned yourself
a break, Master.

10
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:20,083
[BOTH] This is the tale of the
legendary sword warriors,

11
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:24,041
and the Hanamaru days they
spent in a certain citadel.

12
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,416
[HASEBE]
And are you certain?

13
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,125
[HASEBE]
Very well, then.

14
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,333
I'll take my leave.

15
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:46,708
Is there something wrong?

16
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:54,583
It seems that the enemy
has appeared in a new era,

17
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,208
though we're not quite sure.

18
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,333
What?

19
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:58,666
[HASEBE]
According to the master,

20
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,416
something unusual is
occurring in the Edo period.

21
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,083
Maybe we should tell the others

22
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,416
[HASEBE]
Not yet.

23
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,166
For now, we'll continue
to monitor the situation.

24
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,583
No need to stress everyone
out until we know more.

25
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:13,666
Good point.

26
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:19,875
Ah... Ah...!

27
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,333
[SHINANO]
Achoo! Goodness it's cold.

28
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:25,083
Wow the winter season
certainly snuck up on us

29
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,666
all of a sudden, didn't it?

30
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,208
[GOTOU] It's my first
year at the citadel,

31
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,833
so I don't know what to expect.

32
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,000
[SHINANO]
On days like these,

33
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,791
what you really need is
a nice warm bosom

34
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,458
to bury your face in,
don't you think?

35
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,458
[GOTOU] Where the heck
did that come from?

36
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,458
It's nothing to freak out about.

37
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,541
Wouldn't you like one too?

38
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,916
Y'know, I bet the General's
bosom is extra nice.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,583
That's going too far!

40
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:47,875
You are right, though.

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,125
[HOUCHOU]
I know I want one!

42
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,458
A married woman's!

43
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,041
And when I'm done burying
my face in her bosom,

44
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,625
she'll pat my head and
give me tons of candy!

45
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,291
[GOTOU coughs] Anyway, it's not
like we could just knock

46
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,666
on the General's door and
ask them for cuddles.

47
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,833
That's rude.

48
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,000
[SHINANO]
Guess you're right.

49
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,916
If you're feeling cold,
why don't you come

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,458
to the training hall
and get your blood pumping?

51
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,500
Okay.

52
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:22,833
[SHINANO]
Hey, guys.

53
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,291
Shinano!

54
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,500
Do you wanna have
a match with us?

55
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,708
I could, but that's
not why I'm here.

56
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:31,750
[IMANOTSURUGI]
Huh?

57
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,041
[IWATOOSHI]
I see!

58
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,708
So you're looking
for a substitute

59
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,500
for the master's bosom, huh?

60
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,375
I can't believe they're
having this conversation

61
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,958
with a straight face.

62
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:42,916
What'd you say?

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,208
Ah... not a thing.

64
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,666
Don't worry.
I got your back.

65
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,666
If you want bosom, I have
more than enough to spare.

66
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,750
[SHINANO grunts]

67
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,000
Bury your head
in that, little buddy.

68
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,125
[IMANOTSURUGI, KASHUU]
Ah...

69
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,875
[IMANOTSURUGI]
Uh...

70
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,250
[SHINANO sighs]

71
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,208
Bosom.

72
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,416
[SHINANO]
Wait, no!

73
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,958
[IWATOOSHI laughs]

74
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,500
Like that?

75
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:19,041
[SHINANO]
I... I can't breathe!

76
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,041
[IMANOTSURUGI]
Ooh, me too!

77
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,583
Let me in! C'mon! Let me in!

78
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,500
[SHINANO]
Goodbye, cruel world.

79
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
[KASHUU]
Don't die.

80
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,750
There has to be something
else warm and soft

81
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,291
I can bury my face in, right?

82
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,541
[HOTARUMARU]
Welcome home!

83
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,708
[AKASHI]
Must've been a lot of hard work,

84
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,208
but it looks like it paid off.

85
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,875
You bet! My power's
gonna blow you away!

86
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:44,791
[SHINANO]
Aizen, hey!

87
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,625
You're finally back! Congrats!

88
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,125
[AIZEN]
Hey, what's up?

89
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,083
You cold?

90
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,208
Yeah, I've been looking for
something warm to cuddle with,

91
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,875
but I haven't had much luck.

92
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,875
Something warm, huh?

93
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,041
That's easy enough.

94
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:00,833
[LAUGHING BAG 4A laughs]

95
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,750
[SHINANO]
Nikkari.

96
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,500
Excuse me.

97
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,500
Would you mind sharing
that blanket with me?

98
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,125
Oh, you're chilly?

99
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,291
Don't be shy.

100
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:10,208
Thank you!

101
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,375
That looks perfect!

102
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,583
If I pull it up to my shoulders,

103
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,125
it's almost like someone's
giving me a big hug.

104
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,708
I see.

105
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,791
I was longing for the
warmth of a bosom.

106
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,583
You know the feeling, don't you?

107
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:24,791
Not really.

108
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,375
[LAUGHING BAG 4A laughs]

109
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,500
So, uh, you wanna
talk about something?

110
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,750
Like what?

111
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,916
Like something fun
that happened? Maybe?

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,541
Well, let me think.

113
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,208
[NIKKARI]
Actually, just the other day...

114
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,333
I was returning from
a dispatch late at night,

115
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,666
when all of a sudden...

116
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,416
What's that?

117
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,458
[NIKKARI gasps]

118
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:18,166
[screaming]

119
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,041
That's not fun, it's scary!

120
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:20,916
Should I stop?

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,583
Uh-huh, I get the idea.

122
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:23,666
See you later!

123
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:29,166
"Scary?" It was just
Oodenta leaving the bath.

124
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,708
Nothing to scream about.

125
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,083
So scary.

126
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,125
[cracking noise]

127
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,208
[KOGITSUNEMARU] Even simple
tasks are pleasurable

128
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,125
when I think of how
the master will delight

129
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,250
in the fruits of our labor.

130
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,125
Wouldn't you agree?

131
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,291
To give food is to give grace.

132
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:54,791
One is kind on a full stomach,
and cruel without.

133
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,791
[JUZUMARU]
You're correct.

134
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,166
This is indeed a simple task.

135
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:07,000
But even so, it may open
a path to enlightenment.

136
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,416
And you?

137
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Perhaps you found
a new path as well.

138
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,041
It's not much like
a bosom, really.

139
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:14,916
I see.

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,375
My apologies then.

141
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,291
It's warm and fluffy and stuff,

142
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,875
but something's not right.

143
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,333
It's 'cause it doesn't
have any squeeze!

144
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:27,125
[JUZUMARU] I'm sorry that I was
unable to provide assistance.

145
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,375
[SHINANO gasps]

146
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,541
Way too itchy. That's no good.

147
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,000
[SHINANO]
Kinda weird.

148
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,083
[SHISHIOU]
Nue!

149
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,291
No good either!

150
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,458
[SHINANO] Maybe there's
no substitute after all.

151
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,250
[SENGO] I've heard that you are
in need of a bosom.

152
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,583
Allow me to provide my own
in all its glistening glory.

153
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,291
[SENGO] Since early times,
men have kept warm

154
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,333
by stripping and
embracing one another.

155
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,458
Now, let us remove our clothes!

00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,708
Think I'll pass
on that, thank you!

[SHINANO yells]

158
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,166
[SENGO]
Don't run away!

159
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,125
Everyone's so shy
about their body!

160
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,416
[SHINANO]
I'm not shy!

161
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,833
I've just touched way
too many muscles today!

162
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,083
Shinano, hello?

163
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,041
My bosom is ready any time!

164
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,958
It's nice and warm!

165
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:31,958
He's gone.

166
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,083
Hey.

167
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,125
The coast is clear,
so you can leave.

168
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:43,708
You know, this is
perfect, actually.

169
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:47,458
You're so warm and soft,
and your cloak is nice, too!

170
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,333
It wraps around me
and smells good,

171
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:50,875
even if it is a bit dirty.

172
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,416
My cloak wasn't built for two!

173
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,708
Let go already!

174
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,916
[SHINANO whines]
Just a little longer, please?

175
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
[YAMANBAGIRI]
I said let go!

176
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:04,250
[SHINANO]
Pretty please? [whines]

177
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,500
What a shame, and that was
everything I dreamed of, too.

178
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,666
The General might get mad at me,

179
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,833
but at this point,
I've got nothing to lose!

180
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:17,791
General, hey!

181
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:18,875
[door opens]

182
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,166
[HASEBE]
Shinano, perfect timing.

183
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,333
Can you help me carry this?
It's a big surprise!

184
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,166
Look. The master
knitted these for us

185
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,000
so we can stay warm
through the winter.

186
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,458
They spent many a sleepless
night making these,

187
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,750
so be sure to show
them your gratitude.

188
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,208
This is quite splendid,
I must say.

189
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,583
Now I can keep drinking
my tea on the porch,

190
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,291
even in the bitter cold.

191
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,875
I'll go shopping, and
show this hat off!

192
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,416
It even has candy!

193
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,541
Do ya see?

194
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:56,875
Master!

195
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,750
I shall wear this
till my dying day,

196
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,958
and then take it to
the afterlife with me!

197
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,916
Master!

198
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,583
What'd they make
for you, Shinano?

199
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,041
[SHINANO giggling]

200
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,041
It's like a bosom
I can take with me!

201
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,666
A hug that never stops!

202
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,416
[KASHUU] One more reason
for you to come home.

203
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,833
[HASEBE]
I have a report!

204
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:03,041
The History Retrograde Army
has appeared in a new era.

205
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:06,458
You all know how powerful
they were at the Ikedaya Inn.

206
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,375
But this time, we have
every reason to believe

207
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,500
that they'll be even stronger.

208
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,791
They have appeared
in the year 1747

209
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,500
of the Edo period,
which means one thing.

210
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,875
Their most likely targets
are Date Munemura

211
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,583
and Hosokawa Munetaka.

212
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,375
I think I know the event, then.

213
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,916
That's right.
Wasn't Lord Munetaka

214
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,125
killed inside Edo Castle?

215
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,208
[KONNOSUKE]
Yes.

216
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,458
Because he didn't have
a successor yet,

217
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,833
he Hosokawa clan would
have come to ruin

218
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,166
if news of his
death had gotten out.

219
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:41,041
Thankfully, the sixth daimyo
of the Date clan, Munemura,

220
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:44,166
happened to be at the castle
when the corpse was discovered.

221
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,083
Thinking quickly, he proclaimed
that Lord Munetaka

222
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,875
was still alive.

223
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,708
[TSURUMARU] So in other words,
you think their plan

224
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,708
is to kill Lord Date Munemura
before that incident

225
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:56,583
and bring about the downfall
of the Hosokawa Clan?

226
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,500
Not on our watch!

227
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,916
We will send the team
to August fourteenth,

228
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,458
one day before the
event in question.

229
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:07,583
Search out the enemy
and protect Lord Munemura.

230
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,500
With that in mind,
I will now read the names

231
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,541
of those chosen for the mission.

232
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,708
Tantou, Sayo Samonji.

233
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,458
I'll do my best.

234
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:17,791
[HASEBE]
Tantou, Taikogane Sadamune.

235
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,375
Okay, I'm ready!

236
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,833
[HASEBE]
Uchigatana, Kasen Kanesada.

237
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,458
I'll protect the legacy
of the Hosokawa Clan.

238
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,291
It is my sworn duty.

239
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,833
[HASEBE]
Tachi, Shokudaikiri Mitsutada.

240
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,666
No matter the mission,
I will see it to the end.

241
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,125
[HASEBE]
Tachi, Tsurumaru Kuninaga.

242
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,416
Leave it to me!

243
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,625
[HASEBE]
Uchigatana, Ookurikara.

244
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,958
You'll be the captain.

245
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,875
Now that's one way
to mix things up!

246
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,041
Since you were passed down
through the Date clan,

247
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,000
I assume that you know Munemura.

248
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:59,083
I have faith that your expertise
will be valuable here.

249
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,625
[TAIKOGANE]
We're counting on you, Cap.

250
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,125
All right, you will
depart in thirty minutes.

251
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,125
[KASEN] I have close ties
to the Hosokawa clan,

252
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:21,166
so this mission is personal.

253
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,791
I admit I am a bit nervous,
so I came early.

254
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,125
Well, I'm sure you
understand the sentiment.

255
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,916
After all, the enemy's target
is someone from the Date clan

256
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,166
who treasured you for years.

257
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,625
No response, then?

258
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,583
You're the captain--
time to lead.

259
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,291
I don't need to make friends.

260
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,208
Sorry. Were you waiting?

261
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,333
No, it's still early.

262
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:47,916
Though judging from the crowd,

263
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,625
it seems like everyone
is eager to get started.

264
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:51,833
Yeah, you know it!

265
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,250
I'm ready to bust some heads!

266
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,083
Well, that's not quite
how I would phrase it,

267
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,166
but same here.

268
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,708
[HASEBE]
Preparations complete?

269
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,000
[HASEBE]
Ookurikara.

270
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,291
A gift from the master.

271
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,916
Hopefully that will ward
against any nasty surprises.

272
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,583
[OOKURIKARA]
All right.

273
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:18,083
As you know, it is our
duty to protect history,

274
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,125
but that's not everything.

275
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:24,583
As Captain, it is also your duty
to get everyone home safe.

276
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,958
Ookurikara.

277
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,708
The master has left
this team in your hands.

278
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,000
Now prove that their faith
in you was well placed.

279
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,000
Be valiant, but be safe.

280
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,166
'Kay, guys.

281
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,125
Munemura should be at
the Date samurai residence

282
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,000
near Edo Castle.

283
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,500
[OOKURIKARA]
Very well.

284
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:46,625
Ready?

285
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,541
According to history,

286
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,625
Lord Munemura will remain inside
this building for tonight.

287
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,500
Everything checks out, guys.

288
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,916
I just saw Lord Munemura myself.

289
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,875
Sayo went to tell
Kasen and Tsuru.

290
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,375
They're waiting in the back.

291
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,500
The enemy might act tonight,
or maybe tomorrow morning.

292
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,625
[SHOKUDAIKIRI] They'll likely
wait until the sun goes down

293
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:24,333
so that they can slip past us
under the cover of darkness.

294
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,833
I'm afraid bystanders might
get wrapped up in this.

295
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:31,125
[MUNEMURA] It says, "I would
like to meet with you privately.

296
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:34,791
Come to Edo castle today at
sundown and we will talk."

297
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,333
Elder Hotta Masasuke
has summoned me.

298
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,375
Let's go.

299
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,458
[RETAINERS]
Yes, sir!

300
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,791
It seems he's going
somewhere after all.

301
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,791
What could've prompted this?

302
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:00,875
[OOKURIKARA]
Follow him.

303
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,916
He's headed toward Edo Castle,
but I have no clue why.

304
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,458
Time to party.

305
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:30,458
Our enemies are rather crafty
this time, aren't they?

306
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,458
[KASEN]
Scatter like dust!

[SAYO]
I got it.

310
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,583
You're finished.

come on, let's go already!

[SHOKUDAIKIRI grunts]

324
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,916
[SHOKUDAIKIRI] You're only
delaying the inevitable.

325
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,375
[TAIKOGANE]
Nice one, Mitsu!

326
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,500
Now it's my turn! Watch me!

327
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,083
[SHOKUDAIKIRI]
Lovely work.

328
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,875
I didn't know we
were showing off.

329
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,916
Then how about this?

330
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,041
[SHOKUDAIKIRI yells]

331
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,416
[SHOKUDAIKIRI]
Is that flashy enough for ya?

[HRA SOLDIER 11F growls]

333
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,708
Surprise, you fool.

334
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,000
[TSURUMARU]
Looks like that's it.

335
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,958
[KASEN] I wouldn't be
so hasty if I were you.

336
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,458
There's one left,
let's make it count.

[KASEN]
On your knees!

342
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,916
That was careless, Captain.

343
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,333
[SHOKUDAIKIRI]
I'm sure this was their plan,

344
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:23,708
but we've wasted far
too much time out here.

345
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,125
[TAIKOGANE]
Better get moving, then!

346
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,041
That's not good.

347
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,291
It's getting dark.

348
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,083
[MUNEMURA]
I don't see anyone.

349
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:41,791
Who are you?!

350
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,833
Be careful, my lord, stay back!

351
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,458
[KASEN] Why did the enemy
draw Lord Munemura

352
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,291
all the way to Edo Castle
when they could have

353
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,458
killed him at the
residence instead?

354
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,750
Perhaps they're planning
to destroy the Date clan

355
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,708
alongside the Hosokawa.

356
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,291
Oh, no way!

357
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,708
[SHOKUDAIKIRI] Lord Munemura has
no reason to enter the castle

358
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,291
unannounced at night.

359
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,958
If they find his corpse
here in the morning,

360
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,125
they'll assume he was
killed during a secret attack

361
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,625
and the Date clan will
fall under suspicion.

362
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,375
If we let those
monsters outsmart us,

363
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,333
we're gonna look pretty silly!

364
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,833
Less talking, more running.

365
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,000
[TAIKOGANE]
You wanna fight someone?

366
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,750
Then how 'bout you take on me?

367
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,375
[KASEN yells]

368
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,916
A new type of enemy, huh?

369
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,333
Just shut up and kill it.

370
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,375
It's raining.

371
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,541
[HASEBE panting]

372
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:12,291

[GROUP]
Huh?
