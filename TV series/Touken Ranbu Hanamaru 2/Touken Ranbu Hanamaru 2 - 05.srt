00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,583
If you got something to say,
then I'd be happy to listen.

321
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,041
I don't understand.

322
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,500
How is it you're
always so happy?

323
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,125
Is it really that weird, bro?

324
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,166
I dunno.

325
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,916
You haven't been
here all that long,

326
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,916
but you made friends as
soon as you showed up.

327
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,625
I can't even imagine doing that.

328
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,500
What I'm saying is,
if we're both copies,

329
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,375
why are you so
different than me?

330
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,166
[SOHAYANOTSURUGI] If you think
being a copy doesn't bug me,

331
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,291
you're wrong.

332
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,375
But it's not like I can
do anything about it.

333
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:37,708
So why suffer?

334
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,541
We can't help the way
that we're born, right?

335
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,625
But we can change
the way we live.

336
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,958
What's that supposed to mean?

337
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,625
Every story has to have
some kind of beginning,

338
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,916
and that goes for us, as well,

339
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,958
but we get to
decide how it ends.

340
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,083
It's the story of your
life, so make it count.

341
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,125
There's something out
there only you can do.

342
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,500
You just gotta find it.

343
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,750
That's funny, I guess Kashuu's
not coming today.

344
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,708
[HORIKAWA]
Kashuu!

345
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,583
The food's ready.
Come and eat with us.

346
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:33,750
I'm not hungry.

347
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,041
[HORIKAWA]
What's wrong?

348
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,583
I hate seeing you like this.

349
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,708
Listen, I know I'm not exactly a
replacement for Yamatonokami,

350
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:46,125
but I'm good at
helping out, I think.

351
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,458
You know...

352
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:50,500
I haven't been dispatched
one time since January.

353
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,500
Since the Sunomata mission.

354
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,833
But even so, I've been
training every day.

355
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,250
Improving, I thought.

356
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,958
Till Atsushi came back and
beat me in a matter of seconds.

357
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,875
Then challenge him to a
rematch. It was just once!

358
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,458
Kashuu, you're amazing, too!

359
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:10,125
Otherwise, the master wouldn't
have so much faith in you!

360
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,750
You're the only one
they trust to take care

361
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:12,958
of the new recruits.

362
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,458
It has nothing to do with trust!

363
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,708
I only have that job 'cause
I've been here the longest!

364
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:17,958
[HORIKAWA]
C'mon, it's not like that!

365
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:21,708
A sword is made to do
battle, don't you think?

366
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,291
So if I'm denied the
chance to do that,

367
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,208
I'm not worth anything, am I?

368
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,208
This place doesn't
need me anymore.

369
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,541
The master doesn't need me!

370
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,250
You know that's not true!

371
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,541
[HORIKAWA grunts]

372
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,708
I'm sorry.

373
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,916
Wait! Kashuu, come back!

374
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,750
Something that only I can do?
But what?

375
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,083
Sorry.

376
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,208
Kashuu, stop!

377
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,625
Did you two get
in a fight, or what?

378
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:53,791
Not exactly.

379
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,416
[YAMANBAGIRI]
So that's it.

380
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,041
I wanted to help him,
but I made things worse.

381
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,625
Cheering people up
isn't really my thing.

382
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,541
At all.

383
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,125
But this time, there's
something only I can tell him.

384
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,166
[KASHUU chuckles]

385
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,916
Sulking in my room
and running away.

386
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,625
Not cute. Not cute at all.

387
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,500
What am I supposed to do now?

388
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:34,541
Come back and tell
me already, Yasusada.

389
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,666
[YAMANBAGIRI]
Here. You dropped this.

390
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:45,916
[KASHUU]
Yamanbagiri.

391
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,958
Right, thanks.

392
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,541
You're not being excluded
because you're too weak.

393
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,791
You're excluded because
you're too strong.

394
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,000
Uh, what're you saying?

395
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,625
I heard it straight
from the master's mouth

396
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,875
right after they put you in
charge of the new recruits.

397
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,708
I was the attendant that day.

398
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,291
They said,

399
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,708
"It's not just that Kashuu has
been at the citadel the longest,

400
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:13,083
he's also been dispatched
more than anyone else here.

401
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,833
That's why I'm having
him take a little break.

402
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:19,458
To give everyone else
a chance to catch up."

403
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,375
Only I'm not the
strongest at all.

404
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,333
I just lost a match to Atsushi.

405
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,416
[YAMANBAGIRI] Strength on the
battlefield is about more than

406
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,375
just swordsmanship.

407
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,208
You also need the
power to keep your cool

408
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,208
in combat and bring
your team together,

409
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,791
with leadership.

410
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:33,833
Yeah?

411
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,208
So the master put me in charge

412
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,208
because I'm a good
leader, or what?

413
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,916
It's more because you of all
of us possess a good heart.

414
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,208
A lot of the new
recruits are nervous

415
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,291
when they first manifest,
so the master thought

416
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,000
if they had someone
like you to guide them,

417
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,208
they'd feel better.

418
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,291
I see.

419
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,625
That's a relief.

420
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:57,166
I thought that the master
didn't like me anymore.

421
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,583
You probably don't wanna
hear this from me,

422
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,708
since I'm a copy and all.

423
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,166
But, uh...

424
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,041
I think you're doing a good job.

425
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,833
It's something only you can do.

426
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,208
Thank you.

427
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,333
And thank you for
cheering me up, too.

428
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,125
By the way,
I noticed you're not hiding

429
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,333
underneath your hood for once.

430
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,583
What happened?

431
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,375
[YAMANBAGIRI]
Nothing!

432
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,166
[KASHUU] Your cloak is dirty,
but your skin is spotless!

433
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,500
I'm jealous!

434
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,041
[YAMANBAGIRI]
I'm never showing my face again!

435
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,416
[KASHUU laughs]

436
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,125
[MIKAZUKI] Lovely moon
tonight, don't you think?

437
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,833
[KASHUU]
Hey, Mikazuki.

438
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:43,083
[MIKAZUKI] I seem to recall a
similar scene from last year.

439
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:46,125
You, me and Yamatonokami,
I believe.

440
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,958
Oh, yeah.

441
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,708
I sure wish he'd hurry back.

442
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,708
I don't know what
he's doing out there.

443
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,625
[MIKAZUKI] Since we haven't
heard a word from the master,

444
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:57,583
I'm sure he's doing well,
wherever he is.

445
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,125
Did you work through
whatever trouble

446
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:02,000
you were having earlier today?

447
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,291
You noticed, huh?

448
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:06,125
Ugh! I'm so embarrassed
I could die!

449
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,875
It may trouble you now,

450
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,833
but soon it will become
a fond memory.

451
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:13,000
As usual, that's something
an old man would say.

452
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,208
I am an old man.

453
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:16,250
Kashuu.

454
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,041
You've grown kind.

455
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:25,000
[KASHUU chuckles]

456
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,500
What do you mean?
I've always been like this.

457
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:30,625
[MIKAZUKI]
Oh, have you? [laughs]

458
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:32,791
Splendid. Simply splendid.
