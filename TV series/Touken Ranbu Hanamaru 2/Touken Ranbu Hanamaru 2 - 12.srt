00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,750
[AIZEN sighs]
Good! I'm beat!

165
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,916
Welcome back, Yasusada.

166
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,916
It's been a while,
don't'cha think?

167
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,625
[KASHUU]
Yeah, no kidding.

168
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:00,291
Where in the world have
you been all this time?

169
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,541
Oh, here and there--
it's a long story.

170
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,250
That's okay, you can
take your time with it

171
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,375
once we get back home.

172
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,083
I want to hear every detail!

173
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,333
If you're this strong,
it must be epic!

174
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,791
Let's get going, then.

175
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,208
I can't wait.

176
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,333
I'm ready!

177
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,708
Um...

178
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,250
I think I lost my device.

179
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,458
You what?!

180
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,250
Well, I'm sure it's
around here somewhere.

181
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,708
Hey! I found it!

182
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,458
But, uh...

183
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,041
Looks pretty busted.

184
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,583
It won't work.

185
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,083
[AIZEN, ATSUSHI, KASHUU]
What?!

186
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,583
Huh? Wait! I didn't start this!

187
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,208
We had a limited time after all.

188
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,541
We can't just leave!

189
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,083
What now?

190
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,166
It's okay!

191
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,125
I'll be right behind you,
I promise!

192
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,625
But how?

193
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:45,791
I'll come home.

194
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,000
No matter what!

195
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:57,000
[swishing noise]

196
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,541
[KASHUU grunts]

197
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,041
[KASHUU]
It's glowing.

198
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,250
Yasusada!

199
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,416
Kiyomitsu!

200
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm so surprised you
showed up out of nowhere!

201
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,625
I don't really know
how I got here,

202
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,750
so I'm pretty surprised, myself.

203
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:54,833
Whatever.

204
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,916
The point is,
you're back. For real.

205
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,583
And happy to be here.

206
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,625
I'm sorry I kept you
waiting so long.

207
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,750
[YASUSADA]
Four months?!

208
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,166
I didn't know I kept
you waiting that long!

209
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,208
[KASHUU]
Yep.

210
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,458
[YASUSADA]
That's weird.

211
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,375
I got my transportation
device working

212
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,666
right after you left Edo.

213
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,708
[KASHUU] Your device
was in pretty bad shape.

214
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,416
It probably malfunctioned.

215
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,791
[YASUSADA]
Good point.

216
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,416
So, you gonna tell
me about your trip?

217
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,916
You were gone a whole year.

218
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,750
Like where did you go?

219
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,541
Different places
and different times,

220
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,333
though I didn't think it
would take quite so long.

221
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,625
Of course, I didn't want
to interfere with history,

222
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,500
so I could only stay
in each time period

223
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,750
for a few days.

224
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,166
Then I would jump
forward a couple of years

225
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,125
and repeat.

226
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,000
I wanted to see Souji's life,

227
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:47,625
but I wanted to witness
his final moments as well.

228
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,416
That's why?

229
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,625
It was painful
to watch him suffer,

230
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,958
but when I thought
about everyone

231
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,416
that was waiting
back at the citadel,

232
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,166
it gave me strength.

233
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,333
As time went on,
Kondo, Hijikata,

234
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,166
and Souji all passed away.

235
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,416
The Shinsengumi itself
died, as well.

236
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,208
But I continued onward
into the next era.

237
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,583
Then the next era.

238
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,125
And the era beyond that,
and on and on.

239
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,500
Then to modern day?

240
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,041
Yeah.

241
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,458
I saw the age of swords end,

242
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:22,583
the country fall into war,
and the country at peace again.

243
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,333
It made me dizzy
seeing how quickly

244
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,916
the world changed.

245
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,916
It was like stepping
into a whole new country

246
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,583
over and over again.

247
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:30,750
Wow.

248
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,583
And yet, no matter
how many decades passed,

249
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,291
and no matter what changed,

250
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,250
the tale of Souji
and the Shinsengumi

251
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,750
continued to be
passed down every time.

252
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,958
And that made me
realize something.

253
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:47,041
History really is worth
protecting, no matter what!

254
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,833
And I'm so proud to be here
with you fighting for it!

255
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,583
I'm sure that's not exactly
a big revelation for you.

256
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,416
But now, after I've
seen it all in person,

257
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,958
I finally get it.

258
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,166
I'm ready to give this fight
of ours everything I've got!

259
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,333
Good for you, then.

260
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,208
You've grown stronger.

261
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,750
Just like you promised me.

262
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:11,833
[YASUSADA]
Mm-hmm.

263
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,291
It's time to work hard.

264
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,541
I owe it to the master
and to everyone else

265
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,291
since I've been
away for so long.

266
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,541
Oh, hey.

267
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,166
How did you randomly
show up at Edo Castle?

268
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,750
Uh, yeah, funny story.

269
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,166
Huh? What the--?

270
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:46,833
I'm back home.

271
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,041
[HASEBE sighs]

272
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,791
Finished cleaning
the master's room?

273
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:18,875
Yes.

274
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,125
They have proven
to be quite the handful.

275
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,041
[KASHUU] You gotten
used to your body yet?

276
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,458
I still suffer some
lingering awkwardness,

277
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,458
but being locomotive
really does have

278
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:28,666
some nice perks.

279
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,166
I admit, humans
have it pretty good.

280
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,791
It is kinda convenient
to go wherever you want.

281
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,250
[glass breaks]

282
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,666
Hasebe!

283
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,250
I broke another plate!
I'm so sorry!

284
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,333
[HASEBE]
What did plates ever do to you?

285
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:42,583
[KASHUU]
Are you hurt?

286
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,416
Oh, no, I'm doing fine.

287
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,291
Dinner, on the other hand...

288
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,208
We've suffered
enough of this mess.

289
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,291
Listen, from now on
I'll take care

290
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,125
of the master's
daily necessities.

291
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,833
Hey! I didn't agree to that!

292
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,166
[HASEBE]
Come now, Kashuu,

293
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,291
you've told me that you
don't like getting dirty.

294
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,083
[KASHUU]
And what's your point?

295
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,416
[HASEBE] You might get food
on yourself in the kitchen.

296
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,541
So leave it to me.

297
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,166
It's fine.

298
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,708
Hasebe's cooking does always
turn out the best, anyway.

299
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,333
[sighs]

300
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:13,083
I'll be happy when the
master summons more of us.

301
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,250
There's too much work!

302
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,625
It feels so lonely with
all this empty space.

303
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,958
I sure wish Iwatooshi was here.

304
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,125
Iwatooshi?

305
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,416
He's Musashibou
Benkei's giant spear.

306
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,958
He and I protected Lord
Yoshitsune way back in the day.

307
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:30,250
Is there someone like that
you'd like to have here?

308
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,500
There is.

309
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,375
Another sword that was
used by the Shinsengumi

310
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,625
would be really nice.

311
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,416
[IMANOTSURUGI]
Oh, I guess so, huh?

312
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,000
It'd be even better if they
were one of Okita Souji's

313
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,291
swords like me.

314
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,875
We'd have a lot to
talk about, in that case.

315
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,291
[IMANOTSURUGI] Let's hope your
wish come true soon, then!

316
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,458
[KASHUU]
Yours too.

317
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,416
I wanna go back to my time.

318
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,041
To where all my friends
are waiting for me.

319
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,541
Back to Kiyomitsu.

320
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,083
Did it hear me?

321
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,291
It's glowing!

322
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:39,458
Then, before I knew it,
I was at Edo Castle with you.

323
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,166
You think the tree sent you?

324
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,875
[YASUSADA]
It's done crazy things before.

325
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,416
Anyway, that's my story.

326
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,541
Now I want to hear about
what you've been up to.

327
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,500
Well, a lot, really.

328
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:57,000
We have a ton of new
recruits for one, and...

329
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:11,875
Sorry.

330
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,208
When we fought,

331
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,916
I noticed that you were
much stronger than before.

332
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,541
Is that any surprise?

333
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,000
You think I'd let
you overshadow me?

334
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,041
Let's get stronger.

335
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,333
This time as a team.

336
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,000
If you insist.

337
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:33,000
I'll leave you in the dust
if you're not careful, though.

338
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:37,083
[BOTH laugh]

339
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,458
[YASUSADA]
How do you like this?

340
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,041
[KASHUU]
Just fine, thank you!

341
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,833
It feels heavy.

342
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,375
Your sword, I mean.

343
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,291
I've been training my butt off.

344
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,875
Frankly, I'm surprised I
haven't crushed you already.

345
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,333
--[YASUSADA yells]
--[KASHUU yells]

346
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,125
[YASUSADA]
Let's spar again.

347
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,875
Tomorrow, too.

348
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,125
And every day.

349
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,375
I'll be ready any time.

350
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,416
You didn't decorate the room
much; is something wrong?

351
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,708
[KASHUU] We just moved
in a little while back.

352
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,375
We can decorate
it together, then!

353
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,833
Come on!

354
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,333
How long're you gonna keep
everyone waiting out there?

355
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,958
Hold on a sec.

356
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,500
It's been a long time, okay?

357
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:34,583
I'm nervous!

358
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:36,791
[KASHUU]
Take this.

359
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,541
[YASUSADA]
Huh? Wow, you fixed it!

360
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,041
I think I improved it.

361
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:44,500
I had a lot of spare time
while you were gone.

362
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,416
[YASUSADA laughs]

363
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,708
Thanks for waiting!

364
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,666
Yamatonokami!

365
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,541
[GOKOTAI]
It's so good to see you!

366
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:56,708
Good to be back.

367
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,208
We're glad you're home.

368
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:01,041
And I trust you found
what you were looking for?

369
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,083
[YASUSADA]
Yeah.

370
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,958
[KASHUU] I was once the
beloved sword of Okita Souji,

371
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,625
and the first to
manifest at the citadel.

372
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,125
I hope that I can
keep growing stronger,

373
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:17,125
to protect my friends,
and to protect our home.

374
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,375
But even someone as
talented and popular as me

375
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,666
has room to grow.

376
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,916
So...

377
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,166
[YASUSADA, KASHUU]
Thanks for being patient.

378
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,375
Ah!

379
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,833
Seems the cherry blossoms
are waving at you!

380
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,833
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
Man, we got a real crowd!

381
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,666
I'll take a test picture first.

382
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,833
Smile! And smile big!

383
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,791
Let's see.
That turned out pretty good.

384
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,916
Let's do one more, 'kay?

385
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,458
[KONNOSUKE]
Wait for us!

386
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,041
The whole gang is here!

387
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,666
Please excuse our tardiness!

388
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,958
The master insisted on
speaking with all the new

389
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:55,500
Sword Warriors that have
manifested this past year!

390
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,416
Okay, this is the real deal!

391
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,500
Everybody ready to smile?

392
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:00,541
[ALL]
Ready!

393
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,458
One for the history books!

394
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,375
[AKITA, ATSUSHI chuckle]

395
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:17,875
[YASUSADA] I don't know,
this seems a little too cutesy.

396
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,750
[KASHUU]
Well, I think it suits you.

397
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,458
And what's wrong with cutesy?

398
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,250
If you say so.

399
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,250
Well, the master
likes cute things.

400
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,416
Don't you want to be popular?

401
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,708
[YASUSADA]
Eh...

402
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:31,916
Nope, it's way too flashy.

403
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,083
[KASHUU] And here I thought
we were competing.

404
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:56,083
[YASUSADA, KASHUU] This
was the tale of the legendary

405
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,625
sword warriors,

406
00:23:57,708 --> 00:24:01,416
and the Hanamaru days
they spent in a certain citadel.
