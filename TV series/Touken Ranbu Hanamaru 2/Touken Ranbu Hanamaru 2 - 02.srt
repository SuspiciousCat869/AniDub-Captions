[UGUISUMARU]
The year is 2205 AD.

2
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:21,416
The History Retrograde Army
seeks to control the world

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,958
by altering its past.

4
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:26,958
Born from the heart of swords,

5
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:30,416
we travel through time to
intercept and eliminate them.

6
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,500
Perhaps you'd like some tea?

7
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:11,750
Or a small snack?

8
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,333
This is the tale of the
legendary sword warriors,

9
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:21,916
and the Hanamaru days
they spent in a certain citadel.

10
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:30,583
Where am I?

11
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,625
It can't be...!

12
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:38,916
Osaka Castle?

[HONEBAMI]
Ichi. Everyone.

[HONEBAMI gasps, grunts]

15
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,083
Ichi!

16
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:01,500
Come back!

17

[gasps]

18
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,875
[groans] Good news.

19
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,666
I got that manure for you.

20
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,041
You don't want it?

21
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,791
Huh? Ah-ha!

22
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,958
Is that a new recruit
I spy at the table?

23
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,541
It is a pleasure to
make your acquaintance.

24
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:40,291
I'm one of the Five
Great Swords of Japan.

25
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,208
Juzumaru Tsunetsugu.

26
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,416
[YAMABUSHI]
Ka ka ka ka ka!

27
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,166
I am Yamabushi Kunihiro,
famous for my roaring muscles.

28
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,333
Oh, are you copying sutras?

29
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,041
How pious of you, my new friend!

30
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,916
[JUZUMARU]
Are you a Buddhist as well?

31
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,208
[YAMABUSHI] Yes, though I walk
a different path than yours.

32
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,791
There are many
roads to enlightenment.

33
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,375
Indeed, that is true.

34
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,166
I wish to greet
hardship with a smile,

35
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,500
and laugh away every challenge.

36
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,166
I train day and night
to achieve that end.

37
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,291
[JUZUMARU]
That's quite fascinating.

38
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,791
For today's training regimen,

39
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,625
I thought I might seclude
myself in the mountains a bit.

40
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:17,916
Is that so?

41
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,041
I'd be honored if you'd
allow me to join you.

42
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,208
Ka ka ka!

43
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,416
The honor is mine!

44
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,291
That sounds lovely.

45
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,708
Might I tag along, too?

46
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,208
Of course!

47
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,625
For the road to enlightenment
and the road to friendship

48
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,291
are surely side by side!

49
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:40,791
[KASHUU]
Uh...?

50
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,166
Why am I here too?

51
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,041
You're responsible
for the new recruits,

52
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,541
so I thought you'd like
to oversee our little trip.

53
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,125
Okay, then what is
Doudanuki doing here?

54
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,125
[DOUDANUKI]
What?

55
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,500
You're doing bodybuilding,
right?

56
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,833
That's my scene.

57
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,125
Ka ka ka!

58
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,625
Your muscles will be thankful,

59
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,750
because our final
destination happens to be

60
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,500
the top of that mountain.

61
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,416
[KASHUU]
You're joking, right?

62
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,166
We're not climbing that.

63
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,666
[KASHUU groans]

64
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,875
Okay, fine! I guess we are!

65
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,333
Kashuu, that's not
the way we're going.

66
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,166
This is the path of the Buddha!

67
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,750
Why?!

68
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:17,875
Onward!

69
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,458
To enlightenment!

70
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,458
And even bigger muscles!

71
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,708
Why?

72
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:31,375
Why am I here?!

73
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,250
The weather's
warming up a bit, isn't it?

74
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,666
And so soon, too!

75
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,416
Yes, indeed.

76
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,833
It's the perfect season
for a cup of tea.

77
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,625
[HASEBE]
You two.

78
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,625
Have you seen
Yamabushi anywhere?

79
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:52,041
I have a job that could
really use some muscle.

80
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,791
He said he'll be training
in the mountains today.

81
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,291
Is he doing this to avoid me?

82
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,791
He took other Sword
Warriors with him, too.

[HIRANO]
"Ka ka ka ka!

and Doudanuki

86

lining up right behind him.

87
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,083
Nikkari and Kashuu were
there too for some reason.

88
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,250
They all went off
with Yamabushi, huh?

89
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,625
Is something the matter?

90
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,583
The thing is I joined
Yamabushi for training

91
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,333
once before and
it was hardly ideal,

92
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,041
to say the least.

93
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,291
In fact, it was a state
of utter madness.

94
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:23,125
Quite frankly, I fear
that someone might die!

95
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:26,000
This is my fault for not
offering them some tea.

96
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,041
Kashuu will work things out.

97
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,666
Well, probably.

98
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:37,541
[KASHUU] So, uh, we're just
going straight up?

this thing, so can I!

106
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,125
[DOUDANUKI] I'll carry
the weights with my teeth!

107
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,500
But why?!

108
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,375
This is a mess.

109
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,541
My shoes aren't
exactly fit for climbing.

110
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,583
I have an extra pair
of tabi that you could use.

111
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:13,458
Tabi?

112
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,541
They have grips on the bottom,

113
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,125
so they're better
than your sandals.

114
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,500
I'll take what I can get.

115
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,708
[NIKKARI chuckles]

116
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,625
There are two to choose from.

117
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:25,416
These regular, boring tabi.

118

--[KASHUU] Uh...
--[NIKKARI] Or if you're daring,

119
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,083

120

I'm certain that you'll
make the right choice.

121
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,041
Ugh. Let's go.

[KASHUU grunts]

123
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,666
That was an absolute nightmare.

124
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,708
[NIKKARI]
Nice work.

125
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,416
[KASHUU]
Huh?

126
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,333
How did you climb so fast?

127
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,666
[NIKKARI chuckles]

128
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,041
I took the easy way up
while no one was looking.

129
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,083
What? Cheater!

130
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,875
[YAMABUSHI] Now, we enter
the next phase of our training!

131
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,500
[KASHUU] Meditating under
a waterfall? Seriously?

132
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,166
[JUZUMARU]
Rather picturesque, isn't it?

133
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,958
I can't. I don't have
anything to wear.

134
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,166
[NIKKARI]
Never fear.

135
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,041
[NIKKARI chuckles]

136
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,833
[NIKKARI]
There are two to choose from.

This regular, boring robe.

138
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,875
Or if you're daring,

139
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,458
this shiny, golden robe.

140
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:24,750
I'm certain you'll make--

--[DOUDANUKI] Let's do it!
--[KASHUU] Why not?

142
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,666
[YAMABUSHI] Who wants to
try the waterfall first?

143
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,250
[JUZUMARU]
Please, allow me.

144
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,291
Then I offer to you a warning.

145
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,250
Ready yourself, for
my waterfall training

146
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,000
will be unlike anything
you have experienced before.

147
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,000
I face it with courage.

148
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,791
[YAMABUSHI]
That you must, my friend.

149
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:51,375
Nam myouhou renge kyou.

150
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:54,833
Nam myouhou renge kyou,
nam myo-ho...

151
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,791
[YAMABUSHI]
Let's roll!

152
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,875
My muscles roar with power!

153
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,541
Haja kenshou!

154
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,875
No surprise. He is legendary.

155
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,916
An excellent performance,
I must say!

156
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That very nearly
caught me off guard.

157
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,083
[YAMABUSHI]
You're next, Kashuu!

Come forward!

00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,833
If you are able to
overcome this trial,

160
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,875
then without a doubt,
you will acquire the strength

161
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,208
to laugh away any challenge!

162
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,708
I can't turn back now.

163
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,208
Fine! I'll do it!

164
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,916
[KASHUU] The strength to
laugh away any challenge.

165
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,791
[YAMABUSHI yells]

166
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,958
[KASHUU]
No weakness. No fear.

167
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,083
No way, bye!

168
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,458
[KASHUU sneezes]

169
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,958
I'm so cold.

170
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,708
[NIKKARI]
I warmed this up for you.

171
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,125
[KASHUU]
Yeah. I'll pass.

172
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,666
[NIKKARI]
Hm?

173
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,083
An empty stomach can prove
to be a deadly adversary!

174
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,500
Let us vanquish
this beast with food!

175
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,583
[JUZUMARU] I've never seen
such a fierce training regimen.

176
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,083
Ka ka ka!

177
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,375
It's another path
to enlightenment!

178
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:37,625
New feelings, new experiences
from a new perspective

179
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,833
on a road you've
never walked before!

180
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,375
Indeed.

181
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,833
I feel as if a gate inside
me has opened up.

182
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,041
I dunno about all
that spiritual stuff,

183
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,958
but we are weapons, right?

184
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,000
It's our job to be strong,
so we gotta keep

185
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,791
challenging ourselves
any way we can.

186
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,708
[KASHUU]
To be strong. Huh.

187
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:57,750
[NIKKARI chuckles]

188
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,083
Here. Have a bit
of rice porridge.

189
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,333
[JUZUMARU]
Yamabushi.

190
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,000
I hope that you'll allow
me to train with you

191
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,166
next time as well.

192
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,208
Of course!

193
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:14,875
[KASHUU chuckling]

194
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,041
[YAMABUSHI] Now that our
hunger has been satiated,

195
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,875
let's race back to
the citadel, full speed!

196
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,291
Training isn't over
'til your body gives out!

197
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,708
That's true devotion.

198
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,375
[NIKKARI]
You know how to entertain!

199
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,416
That's it. I'm done.

200
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,416
I'm training by myself
from now on!

201
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,875
Whoa, you've got big
bags under your eyeballs!

202
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,083
Do I?

203
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,666
What, did you sneak
out or something?

204
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,000
You rolled on top of me and
then wouldn't stop snoring.

205
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,041
That's all.

206
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,708
Oh, oops, sorry!

207
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,291
Can't really blame me,
though huh?

208
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,125
Our room's getting
really packed.

209
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,958
I'm heading off now.

210
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,458
Oh. Then let me go with you!

211
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,208
Honebami, don't take too long!

212
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,250
[HONEBAMI]
Right.

213
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:10,958
Are you okay?

214
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:17,000
There is a mission that requires
your immediate attention.

215
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,083
This citadel is facing a crisis.

216
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,833
We're out of money!

217
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,458
[HASEBE] I have only my
own negligence to blame

218
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:26,708
for this travesty!

219
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,333
Master, forgive
your foolish servant!

220
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,833
We've been doing whatever
we can to get by,

221
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:35,375
but with all the new recruits,
things are getting pretty tight.

222
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:38,958
[OTEGINE] That New Year's
party didn't help, I'm sure.

223
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,666
In the basement of Osaka Castle,

224
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,875
there might be treasure
left by the Toyotomi Clan.

225
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,375
All their gold was lost,

226
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,750
therefore we can bring it
here without altering history.

227
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,791
There's no tax and no bank fees?

228
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,625
[NAKIGITSUNE (FOX)] The lost
riches of the Toyotomi Clan

229
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:54,500
are like a legend!
I bet it's a massive haul!

230
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,125
It's a real-life treasure hunt!

231
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,083
Sounds like fun!

232
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,416
Guess we know Osaka Castle

233
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,958
better than anyone
else, don't we?

234
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,750
I remember a bit.

235
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:02,916
Now that I think about it,

236
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,583
I burned up when
the castle caught fire,

237
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,458
so my memory's a little hazy.

238
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:07,583
Same with you, right?

239
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:08,750
Uh-huh.

240
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,666
All I can remember
anymore are flames.

241
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,416
Consuming me as the
castle fell to pieces.

242
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,875
Have faith in the Master.

243
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,000
If they chose you for this
mission, then you can do it.

244
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,666
The captain will
be Ichigo Hitofuri.

245
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,291
You will depart immediately.

246
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,916
So exciting! A treasure hunt!

247
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,416
I forgot something.

248
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,708
Be right back.

249
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,166
[NAMAZUO]
Honebami, wait!

250
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,708
[HAKATA]
I can almost smell the gold.

251
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,791
All set, everybody ready to go?

252
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,041
You bet I am!

253
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,333
No, we can't leave!

254
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,833
Wait for Honebami!

255
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,250
[HONEBAMI]
I'm too late.

256
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,833
I think I remember
where they went, though.

257
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:00,916
Here?

258
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,333
[HONEBAMI]
Ichi? Hey, guys?

259
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,000
[HONEBAMI]
It can't be...

260
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:24,500
[HONEBAMI]
Ichi.

261
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,000
Everyone.

262
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,458
[HAKATA] What's taking
Honebami so long? C'mon!

263
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,625
[ICHIGO]
He should be here any second.

264
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,208
[NAMAZUO]
Ichi.

265
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,041
Is something the matter?

266
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,166
[NAMAZUO] This is where
we all burned, isn't it?

267
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:43,541
[ICHIGO]
Yes.

268
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,000
For what it's worth.

269
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,666
[NAMAZUO] Instead of
just taking the treasure,

270
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,416
what if we were able
to save the castle?

271
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,625
[ICHIGO]
We can't.

272
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,625
Then we'd be no
different than the enemy.

273
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,583
No regrets.

274
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,083
This is history.

275
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,833
Yeah, I know that.

276
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,791
And I'm happy
with our new master.

277
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,583
I wasn't serious or anything.

278
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,500
Honebami's taking too long.
I'm worried.

279
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,166
[NAKIGITSUNE (FOX)] The
equipment probably just goofed

280
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,208
up and he's stuck
at the citadel.

281
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,291
I hope so.

282
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,458
[NAMAZUO sighs]
Let me handle it.

283
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,833
One sec. I'll go back and
check on him real quick.

284
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,708
[NAMAZUO]
Honebami?

285
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:33,750
[NAMAZUO panting]

286
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:34,875
Honebami!

287
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,708
Brother?

288
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,708
You worried me!

289
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:49,958
I'm sorry!

290
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,625
It's my fault for being
so hung up on that gold!

291
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,083
Are you okay?

292
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,416
[HONEBAMI]
I'm fine.

293
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,916
I found you collapsed
in front of Osaka Castle.

294
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,166
[HONEBAMI]
I see. I messed up.

295
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,083
No, everyone's just
glad you're safe!

296
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,166
Let him rest.

297
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,166
I think we should
call it a day now.

298
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,208
I was the leader,
so I'll report to the master.

299
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,416
[ALL]
Okay!

300
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,791
Just take it easy.
We'll talk tomorrow.

301
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,375
I'll fix this.

302
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,875
Where'd he go?

303
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,375
[NAMAZUO]
I knew it.

304
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,750
Honebami!

305
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,666
[GROUP]
Honebami!

306
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:22,166
[HONEBAMI]
You followed me. Why?

307
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,875
That's not the issue!

308
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,500
What the heck're you doing?

309
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:30,291
I'm here because
I want to save you.

310
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,500
To stop you from burning.

311
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,583
We're supposed to protect
history! Why would you--

312
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,458
[HONEBAMI]
I'm just moving the swords.

313
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:40,125
When the fire has died down,
I'll move them right back.

314
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:43,125
Don't worry,
it shouldn't alter the past.

315
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,500
Losing your memories is painful.

316
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,541
I've felt it myself.

317
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,833
But I can save you
from that suffering.

318
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,375
It's not worth it!

319
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,083
[NAMAZUO]
I understand.

320
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,625
During our last mission,
I thought the same thing.

321
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,833
Then I realized. I'm happy
with how things are now.

322
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,375
We're who we are because
we lost our memories.

[NAMAZUO]
We're finally all together,

324
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:11,333
and we have so much fun
at the citadel every day.

325
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,083
So what does it matter
if I don't remember

326
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,791
what happened in the past?

327
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,916
If I got those memories back,

328
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,791
then I probably wouldn't be
the same person I am now.

329
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,291
And besides, instead
of getting hung up

330
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,625
on the memories we lost,

331
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,041
we should appreciate the
ones we're making, right?

332
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,666
So don't worry.

333

We've got each other now.

334

I think we'll be just fine.

You mean that?

336
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:39,916
I told you before, didn't I?

337
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,583
We'll make good memories
and forget the bad ones!

We're all done here.

Let's go home now.

We shouldn't make
the master worry.

Let's put all this behind us.
