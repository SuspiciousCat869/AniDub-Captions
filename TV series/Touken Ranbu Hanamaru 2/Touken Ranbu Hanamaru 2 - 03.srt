[cheering]

325
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:28,958
[TSURUMARU]
Let's keep it moving!

326
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,875
Next up is the cavalry battle!

327
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:35,333
Let's go!

328
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:39,208
[SOUZA]
Fleetly. Floating. Fluttering!

329
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,291
[TSURUMARU]
Ball toss!

330
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,625
This is gonna be
a piece of cake!

331
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,333
Who picks up the balls, guys?

332
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,291
My hands are full! Not me!

333
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:53,000
[NIHONGOU. TONBOKIRI,
OTEGINE yelling]

334
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:56,333
[TSURUMARU] Next up is a
three-on-three tug-of-war!

[AIZEN grunting]

337
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,708
Here we go, just nice and easy!

338
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,666
It's refreshing how
unnecessary I am.

339
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,000
[GROUP grunting]

340
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,541
[TSURUMARU] Now, we have
arrived at our main event,

341
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,083
a relay race!

342
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,708
All teams, please
move into position!

343
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,791
Also, it's worth
mentioning that this event

344
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,958
awards double points!

345
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,166
[KONNOSUKE] The scores are
close, so this is your chance

346
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,625
to turn it all
around in one shot!

347

[TSURUMARU] Yagen and Hotarumaru
are at the head of the pack!

350
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,125
[KONNOSUKE] The other three
swords seem to have gotten

351
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,250
a late start.

352
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,875

353
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,333

[TSURUMARU] Bearing the hopes
of his teammates on his back,

362
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,583
Sada pushes ahead!

363
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,250
[KONNOSUKE] And just like
that, he takes the lead!

364
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,708
That gold thingie is all mine!

365
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,416
[HASEBE] It would seem
you're underestimating me!

366
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,500
What the--?!

367
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,125
Keep it up, Sada!

368
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,125
Almost! Come on!

Watch me, Master.

372

[ALL clapping]

377

Well, don't get too excited.

378
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,708
It's not like that
thing is actual gold.

379
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,250
[HASEBE]
What?!

380
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,291
[TSURUMARU]
Look.

381
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,708
Surprises are the spice
of life, don't you know.

[BOTH chuckle]

[TAIKOGANE]
Aw, man.

384
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,208
That was fun and all,
but I was kinda hoping

385
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,125
I could show off
for my big entrance.

386

[SHOKUDAIKIRI]
Here.

387
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,333
It's no medal,
but I hope you like it.

That was nice work out there.
