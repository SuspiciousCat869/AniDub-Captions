Oh. Hello there, Kikkou,

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,416
are you here on business
with the master?

Oh, no, I just thought I
might stop by for a little chat.

Hi! My name is Kikkou Sadamune.

16
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,875
I was once passed down
through the Tokugawa clan.

00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,041
And I'm most famous
for the tortoiseshell crest

engraved on the tang
of my blade.

My name is Sengo Muramasa.

22

Or perhaps you know
me by my other name,

But if you really want
to get to know me,

I believe whatever is hidden
under someone's clothes

33
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,916
should remain a secret.

I will not have
you pestering them.

We don't share a name,

but we were forged
by the same man.

[SENGO] Oh? And what does
that entail, pray tell?

49
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,875
Sometimes I clean their room

and tidy up
clutter on the floor.

51

Sometimes I help them
finish their paperwork.

I also relay their orders
to everyone here.

And in my free time,

75
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,083
[KIKKOU]
Might I make a suggestion?

76
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:05,083
Allow me to be the master's
attendant while he's gone.

77
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,500
Don't startle me.

78
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,291
[SENGO]
Not so fast.

79
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,458
I'd like to nominate myself
for the position as well.

80
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,500
It's nothing but
busy work, really.

81
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,791
If I were to obtain
such a coveted position

82
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,166
so soon after coming
to the citadel,

83
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,500
why, that would make me
a legend, don't you think?

No. Other than Hasebe,

85
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,166
I don't think anyone
here actually cares.

86
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,208
Surely I am fated to do this.

87
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,833
Your reasons are selfish.

88
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:29,958
I, on the other hand,

89
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,958
am motivated only
by my desire to aid

90
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,458
my beloved master
in any way I can.

91
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,583
Therefore, I am the
only suitable choice.

92
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,333
You know what this means.

93
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:39,583
A contest!

94
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,833
Kashuu, you will decide
which of us is more fit

95
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,875
to perform the job!

96
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,250
[KASHUU]
Fine.

97
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,458
The master's wellbeing should
begin with the proper care

98
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,750
of their environment.

99
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,041
So our first challenge
will be cleaning.

100
00:05:56,125 --> 00:06:00,041
Clean body, clean mind,
and clean abode.

101
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:03,500
Now the job must be done
quickly but thoroughly.

102
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:06,291
And whoever cleans to the
end of the porch first wins.

103

In that case, we might
as well be generous

[KASHUU]
Okay. What's next?

140
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,291
A warrior must have endurance,

141
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,666
and they must be prepared
to fight in any situation,

completely nude.

00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,000
See you when you're done.

164
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,250
You're a worthy adversary,

165
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:12,583
but this inferno will melt your
resolution soon enough.

166
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,166
On the contrary,
I'm enjoying the pain.

167
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:23,500
[SENGO laughing]

168
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,958
I heard a weird noise
in here. You okay?

169
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,666
[BOTH groaning]

170
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,000
[KASHUU] Nobody's suffering
from heat stroke, right?

171
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,958
[KIKKOU] I'm fine.
Sorry for the trouble.

172
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,666
[SENGO]
That was perfectly refreshing.

173
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,708
What shall we do for
our next showdown?

174
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,666
What? You're still at this?

175
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,083
[TSURUMARU]
Now that is a surprise!

176
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,416
What's going on
in here, you guys?

177
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm doing magic tricks.

178
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,083
I've been practicing
for a while now.

179
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,875
Yeah, and he's really good!

180
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,166
He can read minds
and everything!

181
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,166
He pulled all sorts of stuff
right out of thin air!

182
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,500
I've been watching
him like a hawk

183
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,666
and I can't tell how
he makes it work.

184
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,416
I still have an escape
trick to show you guys.

185
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,250
I can't move my hands, so cover
them with a towel for me.

186
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,666
Okay, is that good?

187
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,541
Uh-huh!

188
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,166
You better watch carefully!

189
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,416
Voilà!

190
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,458
Whoa!

191
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,166
You tied that improperly!

192
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,291
True bondage must
be done tightly!

193
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,041
Oh. I see.

194
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,416
Why don't we make
this our next competition?

195
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,208
We each choose
someone here to tie up,

196
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,875
and whoever's knots
get untied last

197
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,708
will be declared the winner.

198
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,291
And what's the
relevance of that?

199
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,916
Ingenious.

200
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,666
After all, an intruder might
breach the citadel's defenses

201
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,458
and assault the master.

202
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:58,166
In that event, sub-par rope
work would simply not suffice.

203
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,208
Indeed, the intruder
must be bound properly.

204
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:04,375
So let us begin the Snared-Up
Security String Showdown!

205
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,166
[SENGO] This will be
our final competition.

206
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,750
Winner takes all.

207
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,416
[KIKKOU]
I couldn't ask for more.

208
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,458
[KIKKOU]
I'm finished!

209
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,750
[SENGO]
As am I.

210
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,708
Behold the beauty of bondage!

211
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:20,875
Let's go!

212
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,625
Goodness.
It seems I'm all tied up!

213
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,666
[IWATOOSHI laughing]

214
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,500
So, may I escape now?

215
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,166
Yes. If you think you can!

216
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,500
It's another surprise!

217
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,416
How did you pull that one off?

218
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,041
I'm afraid that's a secret.
I'm sorry.

219
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,291
I don't know any fancy
escape tricks like Nikkari,

220
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,833
but I'll try.

221
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:55,375
[grunting]

222
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,500
That was cool, Iwatooshi!

223
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:02,791
[IWATOOSHI laughs]

224
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,916
Maybe I'll do it
again sometime!

225
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,458
Seems you chose
your volunteers poorly.

226
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,541
Well, it looks like
we have another tie.

227
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:12,625
In that case...

228
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,083
I challenge you to a duel!

229
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,250
As you wish!

230
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,500
We'll settle this quick!

231
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,500
I'm back.

232
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,500
[KASHUU]
Welcome home.

233
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,583
So, did I miss anything big?

234
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,291
[KASHUU]
Same old same old.

235
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,625
Very well.

236
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,458
What are two doing?

237
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:30,458
If you have time for horseplay,
then you have time to train.

238
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,083
Anyway, I need to
report to the master,

239
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,541
so goodbye.

240
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,500
[KIKKOU] I fought valiantly
to prove myself,

241
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,166
but it was all for naught.

242
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,625
You've been a worthy rival.

243
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,000
I had fun today.

244
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,916
Yes. As did I.

245
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,833
We can settle this another time.

246
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,250
And I'll be ready for it.

247
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,833
[IWATOOSHI]
Let's tie everyone up next time.

248
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,500
[chattering]

249
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:00,791
What freaks.

250
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:18,083
Uguisumaru, what is that there?
Are you writing a book?

251
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,416
In a way...

252
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,916
A diary, really.

253
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,833
Why does it have Ookanehira's
name on it, though?

254
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,333
I'm confused.

255
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,458
I wanted to keep a journal
like all of your brothers do,

256
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,875
but I'm not exciting.

257
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,458
So I aimed for a more
engaging subject.

258
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:33,833
[HIRANO]
Now that I think about it,

259
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,541
Ookanehira is a
complete mystery to me.

260
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:40,541
I've only spoken
to him once or twice.

261
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,583
If you don't mind,
would you share

262
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,208
some of your
observations with me

263
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,416
so I can get to know
him a little better?

264
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,000
Heh. But of course.

265
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,666
[UGUISUMARU] For starters,
despite his casual appearance,

266
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,208
he's actually quite
serious about work.

267
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,125
Field duty, huh?

268
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,166
No prob.

269
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,833
I can handle the monotony.

270
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,666
Why are you drinking tea?

271
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,916
There's work here to be done,
you buncha bums!

272
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,333
Don't stress out,
we're doing just fine.

273
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:14,208
We wake up early,
so we finished all our chores.

274
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,291
Right?

275
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,666
Yeah. And I was careful.

276
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,208
I didn't spook the horses
with my power this time.

277
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,041
Bragging about your power, huh?

278
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,875
You're one of the Five Great
Swords of Japan, I know.

279
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,291
But if Ikeda Teramasa
had discovered me sooner,

280
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,875
then I'd be every bit
as famous as you.

281
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,083
Why do you get
so hung up on that?

282
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,208
I don't think cleaning
the barn has anything to do

283
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,875
with being a Great Sword.

284
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,791
It's only a title, Ookanehira.

285
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,541
You're just fine how you are.

286
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:41,916
Shut up!

287
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,375
You don't understand my
feelings and you never will!

288
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:45,791
[JUZUMARU]
Hello.

289
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,958
Are you my partner
for field duty today?

290
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,583
Let's do our best, shall we?

291
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:50,791
Yes, of course.

292
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,958
I will work hard.

293
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,916
[JUZUMARU] We'll be
planting daikon radishes.

294
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,291
So he yells at us,
but he's all polite to him.

295
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,750
[laughs]

296
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,250
[JUZUMARU] Create a shallow
depression in the ground,

297
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,333
like so.

298
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:08,250
Then place four or
five seeds inside.

299
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,875
Cover them with dirt
when you're finished,

300
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,708
then do it again.

301
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,291
Thanks. Got it.

302
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,291
[JUZUMARU]
Then I shall take my leave

303
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,291
to the other side
of the field.

304
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,791
This side is
your responsibility,

305
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,791
so please fill it with
seeds all the way to the end.

306
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,000
Okay, easy!

307
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:32,333
Make a depression
in the ground, huh?

308
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,958
Then four or five seeds.

309
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,041
Cover them with
dirt when I'm finished,

310
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,125
then do it again.

311
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:42,208
Keep going till
the end of the field.

312
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,833
Make a shallow
depression in the ground.

313
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,333
Add four or five seeds.

314
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,875
Make a shallow
depression in the ground.

315
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,333
Add four or five seeds.

316
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,875
Make a shallow
depression in the ground.

317
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,291
Add four or five seeds.

318
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,833
Make a shallow
depression in the ground.

319
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:03,000
Add four or five seeds.

320
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,541
Make a shallow
depression in the ground.

321
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,083
Add four or five seeds.

322
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,291
Make a shallow

Indeed.

Serious to a fault,
you might even say,

a hard worker, isn't he?

That's true.

Although sometimes
that work is misguided

398

and he struggles to no avail.

up hurting himself.
