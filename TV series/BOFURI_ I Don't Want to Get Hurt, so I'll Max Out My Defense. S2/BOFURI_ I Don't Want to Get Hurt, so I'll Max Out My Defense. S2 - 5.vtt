[RISA] I heard on Level Seven
you can make monsters your

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:28.737
--companions.
--Really?

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.451
I'm so excited!

[DORAZOU]
Rawr!

00:02:19.514 --> 00:02:22.351
A new feature you've
all been waiting for:

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:24.478
the ability to tame monsters!

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.022
Before I go further,
I should clarify

00:02:27.064 --> 00:02:29.316
that only some of the
monsters you run into

00:02:29.358 --> 00:02:30.942
will be tamable.

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:34.029
Those monsters can be
identified by this symbol,

00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:35.697
so keep an eye out for it.

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.866
That'll make this a bit easier.

00:02:37.908 --> 00:02:39.826
I wonder if any of those
monsters are helpful

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:41.578
with crafting.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.706
[DORAZOU] There are several ways
to go about taming monsters.

00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:48.085
You can defeat them in battle
or win their affection

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:49.294
with a gift.

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:51.171
Or you can do it by
completing quests

00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:53.423
or meeting certain
other conditions.

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:58.095
And now, ta-da!
Check it out!

00:02:58.136 --> 00:02:59.971
This right here is
the Bridge of Bonds.

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.932
It makes monster
taming possible.

00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:05.018
One thing, though.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.271
A special note to a select few
of you who've already

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:11.274
managed to obtain
monster companions:

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:13.193
Pretty sure that means us.

00:03:13.235 --> 00:03:16.154
This feature does not
support multiple companions.

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:19.241
Only one per player. So sorry.

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:20.283
Too bad.

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:22.077
It does make sense, though.

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:24.663
I guess the best thing for
the two of us to do is help

00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:26.331
the rest of you out.

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:27.666
[KUROMU]
That would be great.

00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:29.793
Much better than trying to
defeat all those monsters

00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:31.628
on our own.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.424
Also, in the eighth event
which will be starting soon,

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:38.635
having a tamed monster will
give you a huge advantage!

00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:39.928
Okay, that's all for me!

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.723
Now everybody get out there
and start taming monsters!

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:43.807
Rawr!

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.769
Maple? Whaddya think?

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:49.604
We'll make it our
goal as a guild

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:51.606
to make sure we're
ready for the eighth event.

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:53.358
Let's go out and find
monster companions

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.735
for all our members!

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:56.653
[KAEDE}
Oh, yeah! Great idea!

00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:57.904
Let's do it!

00:03:57.946 --> 00:04:00.615
We should probably start
by gathering info,

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:03.618
like finding out which
monsters live in what areas.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.121
We've got a volcano,
a desert, an ocean,

00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:07.456
snowy mountains.

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:10.459
Level Seven definitely has
some distinct environments.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.294
I can't wait to explore!

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:14.546
I wonder what
monsters we'll find!

00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:16.298
Maybe there are items I
could make that would aid

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:17.966
in the taming process.

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:20.469
[RISA] If we split up, then we
can cover more ground.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.095
And if anyone
needs help or advice,

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:24.264
all they have to do
is reach out.

00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:25.891
I'm going to go take a look
around on some of the

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:27.225
other levels.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:28.894
It's possible there have
been some changes

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.729
since Level Seven was released.

00:04:30.771 --> 00:04:31.813
Good idea!

00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:36.985
Sounds like a plan! Let's go!

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:38.153

[KUROMU grunts]

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:48.330
So it isn't just a matter
of defeating them.

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:51.708
Well, guess I'll investigate
the level for now

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.169
and save finding a
companion for later.

00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:58.590
[KANADE] According to this,
there are even ghost-type

00:04:58.632 --> 00:04:59.925
monsters that are tamable.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.472
[chuckles] I can see
Sally's face now.

00:05:05.514 --> 00:05:07.015

Eesh!

00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:09.226
Huh? A chill? That's weird.

[KASUMI] I don't recall seeing
that NPC the last time

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:20.362
I was here.

Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit.

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:25.283
You have a curious
look on your face.

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:28.370
It's called "Beneath the
Fog in a Distant Land."

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:31.039
I suppose this must be
a newly added quest.

don't mind, Maple?

--[KAEDE] Hm?

traveling with you two.

That way I know you're safe!

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:54.020
That's so nice of you!

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:56.273
We can't thank you enough!

00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:58.400
[KAEDE] Do you know what kind
of companion you want?

00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:01.361
[MAY] If possible, I'd love
some kind of cute animal!

00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:03.613

[KAEDE] I don't think there's
any way we're gonna be able

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:31.308
to close the gap.

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:32.642
Aw, what a shame.

00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:34.936
They were just too fast for us.

00:06:34.978 --> 00:06:37.188
Hmm. I could use Atrocity,

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.441
but then I might
accidentally kill them.

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:43.236
Okay, I have a plan!

00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:45.488
Let's head back for now
and see if Iz has any items

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.615
that might help.

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:47.741
Yeah!

Hey, Iz?

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:55.498

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.125
[IZ]
Great, aren't they?

00:06:57.167 --> 00:06:59.377
I've collected a bunch of new
recipes since we made it

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:00.879
to Level Seven.

00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:03.465
[KAEDE] If we wear these,
we'll be able to move faster?

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:06.259
Yep! I know it seems like our
members are always wearing

00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:08.845
the same gear, but it's
very important to choose

00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:11.389
the equipment that's right
for your environment.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:12.891
Thank you so much, Iz!

00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:14.893
You're a lifesaver!

00:07:14.935 --> 00:07:16.645
[IZ] Now, I'm not sure if it's
gonna be quite enough

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:18.521
of a speed boost on its own,

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:20.315
but if we supplement
it with some potions

00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:22.609
that raise your agility, then...

00:07:22.651 --> 00:07:24.486
Uh, whoops.

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:26.446
[KAEDE]
What's the matter?

00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:28.114
I gave some to Kuromu
and the others,

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:29.866
and I only have two left.

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:32.243
And I'm out of ingredients.

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:35.163
[KAEDE] Where's the closest
place we can get more of them?

00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:39.000
Looks like they can be found
in this level's ocean area.

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:41.127
Leave it to me,
your guildmaster!

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:43.254
I'll go get them for you!

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:45.006
We'll come along with you.

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:46.216
[KAEDE]
No, that's all right.

00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:48.969
You two should keep looking
around Level Seven.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.136
Okay, then!

00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:51.596
Yeah, whatever you say!

00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:54.349

[MAY, YUI]
Good luck, Maple!

00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:01.940
So, what now?

00:08:01.982 --> 00:08:04.067
We could go explore some other
areas while we're waiting

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:05.777
for Maple to get back.

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:09.447
[MAY]
And yet--

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:10.991
[YUI]
I wonder.

00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:19.916
[KASUMI]
No symbols.

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.335
It appears the monsters
here aren't tamable.

00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:25.839
Maybe that's only
on Level Seven. Still...

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.091
In a valley heavy with fog,

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:30.719
it lies in wait for
you to find it.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.221
Only when you've proven
yourself to be strong enough

00:08:33.263 --> 00:08:35.223
will I tell you anything more.

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:37.851
He was clearly hinting
around at something.

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:40.228
What is there to do
but press on?

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.355
Arms of the Warrior!

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:50.613
These raise our speed
but lower our defense.

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:55.243
But that's all right with us!

00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:57.370
Go! Destroy Mode!

Without Maple's protection...

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.968
...we could get taken
out by a single hit.

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:16.431
[YUI] So we'll have
to hit them first!

00:09:50.173 --> 00:09:51.174
Are you ready?

00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:52.258
[YUI]
Mm-hmm!

00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:02.227
--[BEARS] Bear! Bear! Bear!
--What is it?

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.358
Huh? Oh, no!

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:12.320
[BEARS]
Bear! Bear!

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.119
[YUI]
We gotta do something!

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.203
[MAY]
Yeah!

00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:22.330
[yell]

00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:23.540
That didn't hurt.

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:26.126
Huh?

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:40.431
Ah! Pretty!

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:42.058
But even if you
could tame a fish,

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.852
it seems like it would
be pretty hard to take it

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:45.311
around with you.

00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:51.234
I wonder if it would be possible
to tame one of those!

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:52.861
Follow them, Syrup!

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:54.195
T-Turtle?

00:10:54.237 --> 00:10:56.281
Don't worry, we can find
those ingredients for Iz

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:57.991
after we get done here!

00:10:58.032 --> 00:10:59.200
Come on, let's go!

00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:00.869
[SYRUP]
Turtle!

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:06.499
Ah. We failed again.

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:08.877
Come on, Sis!
Let's give it another go!

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:16.759
Arms of the Warrior!

00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:18.928
Sixth of Sword: Blaze!

00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:23.016
[KASUMI yells]

00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:34.194
And on we go.

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:36.988
[KAEDE]
And nine, and ten.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.573
There!

00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:40.950
Wow, I managed to find a lot!

00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:42.577
I think this should be enough.

00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:43.703
Hey, Syrup!

00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:45.580
Take me back to Iz so she can--

00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:49.626
[yells]

00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:50.877
[SYRUP]
Turtle?

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:52.754
[KAEDE]
No!

00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:57.133
Atrocity!

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:08.978
[KAEDE yells]

00:12:25.787 --> 00:12:29.082
Did I get dragged down
into that weird haze?

00:12:29.123 --> 00:12:31.292
Hey, Atrocity wore off!

00:12:31.334 --> 00:12:33.962
Aww! Well, that was a waste.

00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:40.969
Devour!

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.099
Ah! Hold on!

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:50.019
[yells]

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:51.229
Don't!

00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:06.369
I never dreamed that this
quest would be spread

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:08.538
across three levels.

00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:10.623
What could be waiting
at the end?

00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:12.417
Let's go! Mind's Eye!

00:13:16.045 --> 00:13:18.214
Come to think of it,
maybe Sally has the right idea

00:13:18.256 --> 00:13:20.216
about these things after all.

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:22.093
First of Sword. Heat Haze!

00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:26.180
Fourth of Sword. Whirlwind!

00:13:31.602 --> 00:13:34.605
Leap! Third of Sword.
Lonely Moon!

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:39.068
Purple Phantom Blade!

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:53.708
Really, it's such an amazing
skill, except for this one part.

00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:02.258
[MAY]
We've gone back again and again,

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.385
and we get so close.

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:06.721
But in the end, we keep losing.

00:14:06.763 --> 00:14:08.765
I wish I was able to help,

00:14:08.806 --> 00:14:11.059
but I have got
my hands full, too.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.060
[YUI]
Oh!

00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:13.561
You don't have to
worry about us!

00:14:13.603 --> 00:14:14.520
That's right!

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:17.565
This just makes us more
fired up to kick its butt!

00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:21.778
Whoa! Talk about an
overload of cuteness.

00:14:21.819 --> 00:14:24.197
Here. Thought you
might like this.

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:29.494
Oh, so cute!

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:31.454
Hey, easy, Sis.

00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:34.540
I accept this.

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:36.751
Please enjoy!

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:39.962
You know, Maple sure is taking
a long time to get back.

00:14:40.004 --> 00:14:41.714
Just how far did she go?

00:14:44.008 --> 00:14:46.260
[KAEDE yells]

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:49.597
Well, I sure wasn't expecting to
get dragged down even deeper.

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:52.642
Is this the end of it, at least?

00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:54.977
Ew! So disgusting!

00:14:57.688 --> 00:14:58.815
Devour!

[KAEDE screams]

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:25.174
Is some devil or snake
about to appear?

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.809
A paralysis status effect?

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:36.310
No, that's not it.

00:15:36.352 --> 00:15:37.812
What's holding me back?

00:15:41.023 --> 00:15:43.317
I didn't think there would
actually be a snake.

[BEARS]
Bear!

00:15:50.324 --> 00:15:52.785

to save you!

I see. Huh.

00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:08.801
Well, then.

00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:10.219
Let's try this again.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:19.520
Okay, it may have eaten me,
but since I'm not in the water,

00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:21.355
I have freedom of movement!

[KAEDE] What's the matter,
didn't like how I tasted?

If you won't eat me,
then I'll eat you!

One failure after another.

We won't give up, though!

00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:26.921
Good. And neither will I.

[KASUMI] Seems only blows to
the forehead inflict damage.

00:17:44.188 --> 00:17:46.440
How should I proceed?

00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:47.942
Blood Blade! Ha!

00:17:50.653 --> 00:17:52.905
But still, every time
I get close to it...

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:02.999
Wait. Is this some sort of
guardian that can't be defeated?

00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:07.253
It's do or die!

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:08.838

What do you know?

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:38.492
I improvised and it
worked like a charm.

00:18:40.703 --> 00:18:41.746
Now then.

00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:49.754
[KAEDE grunts, yells]

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:03.893
Ah! It's so deliciously savory!

00:19:23.245 --> 00:19:25.790
How will it react to me?

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:27.041
Let's see.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.854
Now, then.

00:19:48.896 --> 00:19:50.356

Aw, I wasn't done yet!

00:20:36.318 --> 00:20:38.988
Well, that was the best-tasting
monster I've ever eaten!

00:20:40.197 --> 00:20:42.575
Hey. I gained a new skill.

00:20:42.616 --> 00:20:46.370
It's called Invitation
to the Ocean Floor.

--[KASUMI] Don't you think?
--[IZ] Yeah, you're right.

[MAY, YUI]
Hey, everyone!

00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:57.631
It looks like you two
succeeded in the end.

Yeah! Sure did!

00:20:59.341 --> 00:21:00.885
And so did you!

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:04.054
What is your little
snake's name?

00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:07.183
Haku! It's not too basic, is it?

00:21:07.224 --> 00:21:10.561
[YUI]
No way! It's adorable!

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:13.063
[KUROMU] That just leaves
me, Iz, and Kanade.

00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:14.982
Yeah, well, I'm on it.

00:21:15.024 --> 00:21:16.901

Oh, really?

Oh, well this is perfect!

I've got a little
surprise for you two!

[MAY, YUI]
Hm?

00:21:28.329 --> 00:21:30.206
Awesome!

00:21:30.247 --> 00:21:32.750
There's nothing you
can't make, is there?

00:21:32.792 --> 00:21:34.543
I just figured you'd want
to look as cute together

00:21:34.585 --> 00:21:35.920
as possible.

00:21:35.961 --> 00:21:37.588
Thank you so much!

Have you chosen names?

Yes! This one is Tsukimi!

Such great names.
