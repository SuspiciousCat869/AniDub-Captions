WEBVTT

00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:12.429
Let's do our best today!

00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:14.431
And since we have
two medals now,

00:00:14.473 --> 00:00:16.683
we just gotta make sure
we get three more!

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:19.228
Huh? That's weird.

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.813
It's morning, isn't it?

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:22.731
Yeah.

00:00:22.773 --> 00:00:24.816
Wonder what's going on.

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:27.236
[RISA] Bad news,
my map isn't displaying.

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:29.196
Odd. Neither is mine.

00:00:29.238 --> 00:00:30.322
Same here.

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:31.490
And to make matters worse,

00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:33.867
it looks like messaging
is down, too.

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:35.702
[KUROMU] There's no telling
what might happen.

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:37.621
We'd better stick together,
just to be safe.

00:00:37.663 --> 00:00:40.123
[KAEDE]
Right, good idea.

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:41.166
What now?

00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:58.433
[KAEDE]
Where the heck am I?

00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:02.813
Sally! Guys!

00:01:05.357 --> 00:01:08.527
Oh, yeah. No map.

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:11.029
Guess I'll have to
go it alone for now.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:12.447
Just hang in there, everyone.

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:13.615
Don't die!

00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:17.661
[RISA grunts]

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:22.332
Looks like they decided
to split us all up.

00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:24.251
Those admins are malicious.

00:01:24.293 --> 00:01:28.005
I'm sure Maple will be okay,
but I'm worried about the twins.

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:38.181
[RISA]
Huh?

00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:41.602
[FREDERICA] Oopsie,
didn't mean to interfere.

00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:42.811
[RISA]
Frederica?

00:01:42.853 --> 00:01:45.314
[FREDERICA laughs]
So, we meet again, huh?

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:47.983
Well, let's crush
a monster or two.

00:01:48.025 --> 00:01:50.110
Oboro! Fire Child!

00:01:50.152 --> 00:01:51.236
[OBORO vocalizes]

00:01:52.988 --> 00:01:54.323
Multi-Fire!

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:56.575
Hey, Notes. Song time!

00:01:56.617 --> 00:01:58.869
[NOTES vocalizes]

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.500
All right. Cross Fire.
Shadow Clone!

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:06.543
[OBORO vocalizes]

00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:17.429
Okay, then.

00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:18.764
Guess I'll attack.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.265
Use Multi-Waterbolt!

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.650
[FREDERICA]
Let's finish this up.

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:31.193
Multi-Firebolt!

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:32.903
Notes, use Amplify!

00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:41.578
[FREDERICA]
Whew!

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.455
Looks like we managed
to beat them.

00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:45.666
My guildmates are all far away,

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:48.293
so I was wondering what I was
gonna do without their help.

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:50.962
[RISA] Wait. You know
where your group is at?

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:51.963
Yeah.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.132
I have a skill that
helps me with that.

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:56.343
So, I have a
proposition for you.

00:02:56.385 --> 00:02:59.262
It involves us teaming up.
That right?

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:00.472
Bingo!

00:03:00.514 --> 00:03:02.516
I mean, there are
no downsides to it.

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:04.351
Sure beats fighting alone.

00:03:04.393 --> 00:03:07.854
Hmm. Well, it's a
compelling argument.

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:09.648
[FREDERICA]
Right? So, we're good, then?

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.941
[RISA]
Yep.

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:12.609
[FREDERICA] I take it you can't
get in touch with your crew,

00:03:12.651 --> 00:03:15.487
either? Just stick
with me for a while.

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:17.531
Yeah. Will do.

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:22.661
That's strange.
Those from the event?

00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:24.996
Nope. That's our
guild's special signal.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.165
It's perfect for
something like this.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.126
You can set off
fireworks in here?

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:30.293
No way.

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:32.713
That's just our leader
setting off explosives

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:34.673
she sticks on herself,
Maple-style.

00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:36.299
Huh? She does what?

00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:39.010
Uh, hey wait for me!

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.512
[RISA]
Pedal to the metal, Frederica,

00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:41.888
or I'll leave you behind!

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.599
[FREDERICA] Ugh. You're
kinda bossy, you know that?

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:52.607
I'm okay!

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:55.193
That said, I hope someone
finds us quickly.

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:57.154
All right, Syrup, you're up!

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:58.321
[SYRUP]
Turtle!

00:03:58.363 --> 00:04:00.115
Syrup, use Spirit Cannon!

00:04:00.157 --> 00:04:03.535
[SYRUP]
Tur... tle!

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:04.995
Okay, it's my turn!

00:04:08.457 --> 00:04:11.501
That's not really a good spot to
hang out, Mister Monster!

00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:13.545
[SYRUP]
Turtle?

00:04:14.463 --> 00:04:18.467
[KAEDE yells]

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:22.804
So soft.

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:27.809
[MII] Do I even wanna know
what you're doing, Maple?

00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:28.852
Mii!

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:35.484
Hurry, before we're
digital minced meat!

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:37.694
This is a bad situation!

00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:42.115
[BLAZING BRO A]
You okay?

00:04:42.157 --> 00:04:43.366
Can you stand up?

00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:47.204
It's no use, bro!
We're already as good as dead!

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:49.039
[BLAZING BRO A]
Keep it together!

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.458
Come on, you're a
strong guy, aren't ya?

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.876
[BLAZING BRO C sobs]

00:04:52.918 --> 00:04:55.545
It's just a little further.
You can do it!

00:04:55.587 --> 00:04:57.339
[BLAZING BRO C sobs]

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.716
Hurry. I believe in you.

00:04:59.758 --> 00:05:01.009
Start moving!

00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:03.553
This is no time for
passionate speeches!

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:06.556
I'm coming!

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:09.351
[KAEDE]
What? The whole map?

00:05:09.392 --> 00:05:10.185
Yeah.

00:05:10.227 --> 00:05:13.897
Seems it's being swallowed up by
darkness from the outside in.

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:16.608
It's already claimed several of
my fellow group members.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.568
I'll be super careful, then.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.696
I'll find some way to repay
you for all of your help.

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:23.156
Funny you should say that.

00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:25.158
There is something you can do.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.910
Mind holding this?

00:05:26.952 --> 00:05:29.621
It's going to disappear
once the event is over.

00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:30.622
Let's see.

00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:33.208
Oh, it's a Marker Card.
That's really all you want?

00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:40.465
Yeah. Keep it.

00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:43.009
It's a special item
that Markus crafted.

00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:45.720
As long as you have this,
I'll know where you are.

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:48.473
Wow, that's really handy.
Thank you!

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:50.016
Turtle!

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:55.981
The next time we meet,
I hope it won't be as enemies.

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:57.232
Take care.

00:05:57.274 --> 00:05:59.109
Yeah! Thanks again!

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.694
See you later!

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:01.778
[MII]
Bye!

00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:07.117
[KAEDE]
All right.

00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:09.494
We gotta get back to
setting off fireworks.

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:10.537
Right, Syrup?

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:11.955
Turtle!

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.473
Your companion's
ability is amazing.

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:34.811
[MARKUS] I still can't believe
the two logistics specialists

00:06:34.853 --> 00:06:36.688
got stuck in a dungeon.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.982
Depending on what the
boss is, we're toast.

00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:40.191
This sucks big time.

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:42.360
Well fortunately, I'm with
Markus the Trapper.

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:43.737
I think we'll be fine.

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:48.241
[MARKUS] Thanks, but flattery
will get you nowhere.

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:02.547
[KUROMU] We gotta do
something about their numbers.

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:05.300
It's okay, we can use their
own numbers against them.

00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:06.760
Help me out, Bell!

00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:17.437
[KUROMU] Man, I'm so glad I got
paired up with support like you.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.358
Well, having a fantastic shield
user like you isn't bad either.

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:22.734
[KUROMU]
Aw, shucks!

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:24.986
Necro! Use Burst Flame!

00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:30.283
Holy Spear!

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.330
[KUROMU] Revitalize! Necro!
Armored: Strong!

00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:44.506
[KUROMU] How long
do you think we'll last?

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:46.007
[MISERY]
Don't give up.

00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:47.717
It shouldn't be much longer.

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:49.886
Look! There she is!

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:58.228
[KUROMU]
So cool.

00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:03.858
Mii! Thanks so much
for the assist.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.568
I'm glad you're safe.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.779
Oh, Kuromu is with you?

00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:08.947
[KUROMU]
Sure am.

00:08:08.989 --> 00:08:12.409
By any chance, have you
seen anyone from my guild?

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.452
I actually saw Maple earlier.

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:16.997
She was up to something
pretty crazy, though.

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:19.207
[KUROMU]
Oh, you mean the fireworks?

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:20.333
Fireworks?

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.670
We'll-- Let's talk later.

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:25.964
It seems Shin and
Markus are still alive.

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:27.298
Let's find them.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.384
Nice. We should hurry, then.

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:31.469
[KUROMU]
Would it be okay if I tag along?

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:33.930
Before I ran into Misery,
I saw a few other players

00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:35.348
milling about.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.808
While I'm not completely sure,

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.893
I kind of assume running
into this many people

00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:41.354
on such a large playing
field means that everyone's

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:43.857
being sent to roughly
the same spawning points.

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:44.899
I see.

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:46.735
So, you suspect the
members of Maple Tree

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:49.112
might be near where our
guildmates are located.

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:50.280
Right?

00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:52.198
[KUROMU] It's only a
possibility, but it sure beats

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.491
searching blindly.

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:55.160
What about Maple?

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:56.578
[KUROMU]
Maple's pretty innovative;

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.747
she'll be fine on her
own for a while.

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.999
[MII laughs]
You do have a point.

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:03.585
It'd be nice to have
a shield user with us.

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:05.920
I suppose we'll be working
together a little bit longer,

00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:08.506
then. I'm looking
forward to it.

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:10.383
[KUROMU]
Yeah. Let's do this thing.

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:29.194
[MARKUS]
Remote Trap. Wind Strike!

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:32.655
Do it!

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:33.698
[MARKUS]
Change!

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:42.373
[IZ]
Nice work!

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:44.584
It's easier to aim when
they're this close!

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:46.336
Cannons. Fire!

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.856
Huh, what was that?

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:08.441
[KUROMU]
Probably our Crafter.

00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:10.318
She's scary when she's angry.

00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:14.197
[KUROMU]
Hey, Iz!

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:16.449
Looks like you're okay!

00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:17.742
Oh, Kuromu?

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:20.078
[MARKUS]
Mii! Thank goodness!

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.830
[MII]
I'm glad you're safe, Markus.

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:24.999
I was a bit worried when your
signal disappeared suddenly.

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.126
[MARKUS]
Well, yeah.

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:28.461
A lot has happened,
but I guess I came out

00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:29.879
more or less intact.

00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:31.840
But on the plus side,
we just beat a boss

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:33.133
and got medals.

00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:35.635
[chuckles]
I got the notification.

00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:37.303
Thanks for your hard work.

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:39.180
[KUROMU]
You two beat it on your own?

00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:43.268
[laughs] We made a pretty
good team! Right?

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:45.603
[MARKUS] With your firepower,
I'm sure you're more than

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:47.355
capable of fighting on your own.

00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:48.439
Oh, please.

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:50.024
I'm just a Crafter, after all.

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:51.901
You were a huge help, Markus!

00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:53.611
Gotta give credit
where it's due!

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:54.821
[laughs]

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:01.578
[KASUMI] I can't believe they
multiply when slain.

00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:03.037
I wonder how many are left.

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:04.873
[SHIN] Dunno, but it
feels like a million.

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:09.711
Whatever, looks
like I'm up again.

00:11:09.752 --> 00:11:11.880
[KASUMI] Good luck.
I'm counting on you, Shin.

00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:15.091
Wen! Wind God!

00:11:19.554 --> 00:11:20.889
Now, Split-Sword!

00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:25.894
[laughs]

00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:28.021
Big numbers aren't
enough to defeat me--

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:34.861
[KASUMI]
Phantom Blade!

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:36.613
[KASUMI yells]

00:11:41.993 --> 00:11:44.954
Thanks a lot. You saved my skin.

00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:46.206
[laughs]

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:48.666
That said,

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:51.169
you make for an
adorable little warrior.

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.296
Shut up!
Don't make me skewer you!

00:11:58.635 --> 00:12:01.095
I guess we managed
to get out alive.

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:03.139
But even if I manage
to find Mii somehow,

00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:05.433
our base is probably long gone.

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:06.601
Huh?

00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:11.272
Hey! Hey!
We're over here!

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:13.107
Stop it, before they see us!

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:15.276
Uh yeah, that's kind
of the point, silly.

00:12:15.318 --> 00:12:16.611
Come on, help me signal them.

00:12:17.528 --> 00:12:19.739
[KASUMI yelps]

00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:23.451
[SHIN]
Hey! Hey!

00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:24.661
Hey...

00:12:36.547 --> 00:12:37.715
Thanks for the help.

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:40.426
I doubt I would have survived
this battle on my own.

00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:41.803
Sure, no problem.

00:12:41.844 --> 00:12:44.973
Though, to be honest, having you
for support has made it easy.

00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:46.224
I owe ya one.

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:48.184
You two stay hidden
for a bit longer,

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:51.062
since I can't protect you guys
the same way Maple can.

00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:52.480
Sorry for the trouble.

00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:54.274
Yeah, thank you both.

00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:57.151
Hey, good news, looks like
Frederica's headed this way.

00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:58.611
Just have to hang tough!

00:12:58.653 --> 00:12:59.612
Agreed!

00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:00.905
Go, Fireball!

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:05.076
[DRAG yells]
Earth Surge!

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:11.416
Awesome!

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:13.418
If only we could
also fight like that.

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:15.086
Then we'd be more useful.

00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:16.838
Don't be sad, we all
have different things

00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:18.089
we're good and bad at.

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:19.966
And I'm positive there will
be a time for you guys

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:21.134
to shine, too.

00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:22.593
[MAY, YUI]
Uh, right!

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:23.720
Whoops!

00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:25.054
Protective Barrier!

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:29.183
Nice guarding!

00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:31.311
You're every bit as
good as Frederica!

00:13:31.352 --> 00:13:33.396
Well, that's good to know, Drag.

00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:35.606
Guess you won't need my
help in the future, then.

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:37.358
Oh, you're here already?

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.818
That was pretty quick.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:39.777
[KANADE]
Nice!

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:41.362
And you brought Sally with you!

00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:42.655
So this is where you were.

00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:44.490
And you've got Yui and May, too?

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:46.576
[YUI] Yep. We were making
our way to Maple

00:13:46.617 --> 00:13:50.371
and were almost there,
but Sis and I are just too slow.

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:52.540
Yui. The fight's still going on.

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:54.709
We'll have to save
small talk for later.

00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:57.670
[RISA] Hmm. We might actually
be all for good now.

00:13:57.712 --> 00:13:58.671
[MAY, YUI]
Huh?

00:13:58.713 --> 00:14:00.048
[PAYNE]
Sword of Judgment!

00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:01.674
[DREAD]
Whirlwind Flurry!

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:08.681
I'm glad you're safe.

00:14:08.723 --> 00:14:10.850
[DREAD] Though, I didn't expect
to find more than our own

00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:12.018
guild members.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.728
Yay, Payne and Dread are here!

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.272
Wow, you two sure have
gotten a lot stronger.

00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:19.442
Now I'm happy that the
main event wasn't PVP.

00:14:19.484 --> 00:14:20.902
[PAYNE]
Where are the other members?

00:14:20.943 --> 00:14:23.071
There aren't too
many of them left.

00:14:23.112 --> 00:14:25.865
Apparently, our base got
swallowed up ages ago.

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:28.284
So now we'll have to
find a new location.

00:14:28.326 --> 00:14:29.952
Damn, that's frustrating.

00:14:29.994 --> 00:14:32.497
Perfecting our base
was a lot of hard work.

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:34.415
[DREAD]
Nothing we can do, though.

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:37.585
Gonna be hard to keep exploring
continuously without a base.

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:42.924
So, hey.

00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:45.635
I have an idea I'd like
to negotiate with you.

00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:46.886
Is that all right?

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:55.478
[KAEDE]
Huh? What does that mean?

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.646
Simple.

00:14:56.687 --> 00:14:58.314
We would offer up
the use of our base

00:14:58.356 --> 00:15:00.817
and then have the other
guilds go there with us.

00:15:00.858 --> 00:15:02.985
[KUROMU] Yeah, I was
thinking the same thing.

00:15:03.027 --> 00:15:05.196
What do you say, Guildmaster?

00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:07.073
Oh! Good idea!

00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:09.992
With everyone, we can beat any
monsters that might attack!

00:15:10.034 --> 00:15:11.702
The more the merrier,
right, Syrup?

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:12.995
Turtle!

00:15:13.037 --> 00:15:16.499
Then it's settled! Hopefully, we
won't be too big of a burden.

00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:18.626
We don't have much
to offer, though.

00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:20.420
[MARKUS]
Maple's base, huh?

00:15:20.461 --> 00:15:22.213
Are there any weird traps?

00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:23.214
Nah!

00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:25.258
I'm sure that it's mostly safe.

00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:26.467
"Mostly"?

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:29.178
More importantly, how'd your
base end up exactly

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.555
in the middle of the map?

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:32.265
Sure is convenient.

00:15:32.306 --> 00:15:34.434
Well, that was kind
of just chance.

00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:36.352
Maple has, like,
crazy good luck.

00:15:36.394 --> 00:15:38.729
Maple's the coolest, isn't she?

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:41.232
We're a pretty big group. Sorry.

00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:42.442
It's fine!

00:15:42.483 --> 00:15:44.777
Plus, having more people
means having more fun!

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:46.487
You know?

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:47.530
Thank you.

00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:49.282
The rest of our guild
members should be arriving

00:15:49.323 --> 00:15:50.783
any moment now.

00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:51.951
[BLAZING BRO A]
Hey, Boss!

00:15:51.993 --> 00:15:55.037
[chattering]

00:15:55.079 --> 00:15:57.206
[DREAD] Look who's still
alive and kicking.

00:15:57.248 --> 00:15:58.541
I see.

00:15:58.583 --> 00:16:00.293
And you thought Maple
had good luck.

00:16:01.335 --> 00:16:02.545
Okay.

00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:05.298
In that case, I guess it's
about time to head back!

00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:07.175
While I doubt space
will pose a problem,

00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:08.926
we'll need to make sure
the other guilds can use

00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:10.720
the various facilities.

00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:13.723
Ah! I'll have to make
a few things!

00:16:13.764 --> 00:16:16.642
Which means it's time to
show off my Crafter skills!

00:16:16.684 --> 00:16:18.311
Wait. I know that look.

00:16:18.352 --> 00:16:19.604
She's fired up!

00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:02.146
[F ADMIN A] All right, it's
just about time to release

00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:03.689
the day-two monsters!

00:17:03.731 --> 00:17:04.649
[ADMIN A]
Yep.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.735
It seems the forced relocation
took out a big chunk of players.

00:17:07.777 --> 00:17:10.696
Now to give the rest of
them a series of trials!

00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:12.240
[ADMIN B] Looks like all
the players are still pretty

00:17:12.281 --> 00:17:13.824
scattered, too.

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:16.118
[SECRETARY] They won't complain
that we're being unfair again,

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.161
will they?

00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:18.538
[ADMIN A]
Huh? Um, no way!

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:21.040
We divided them up by
difficulty level this time,

00:17:21.082 --> 00:17:22.833
and the event wouldn't
be fun if the highest

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:25.670
difficulty was
that easy to beat.

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:27.129
[ADMIN C]
Hey! Look at this!

00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:29.465
[ADMIN B] Is that more than
two parties in one place?

00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:30.883
[F ADMIN A]
Where is that?

00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:33.636
[SECRETARY] A dungeon made even
more deadly by the players:

00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:34.637
Maple Tree.

00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:36.931
The surviving members of
Order of the Holy Sword

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:39.100
and the Flame Emperors have
joined them in their base.

00:17:39.141 --> 00:17:41.310
[ADMIN A]
Why? How?

00:17:41.352 --> 00:17:43.688
[F ADMIN A] So many players!
So many players!

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:45.189
[ADMIN B] And sending all
of tonight's monsters there

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:48.276
to attack would be far too
cruel-- for the monsters.

00:17:48.317 --> 00:17:50.528
[ADMIN C] But then we
can't stop them! Right?

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.697
[ADMIN A] We did all the
thinking and adjusting we could

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:54.699
to minimize the number
of players that actually

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.576
complete this event.

00:17:56.617 --> 00:17:57.493
[F ADMIN A]
Yeah.

00:17:57.535 --> 00:18:00.079
We sent out strong monsters,
we destroyed bases,

00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:02.915
we even made the maps unusable.

00:18:02.957 --> 00:18:05.167
[ADMIN B] Not to mention,
we added completion prizes

00:18:05.209 --> 00:18:07.378
appropriate to the
difficulty level.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.589
[ADMIN C] But if the three top
guilds really are working

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.300
together, then a lot more people
are gonna complete the event

00:18:12.341 --> 00:18:14.260
than we initially planned for!

00:18:14.302 --> 00:18:16.220
[ADMIN A]
So, what happens if they do?

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.306
[F ADMIN A]
You don't know?

00:18:18.347 --> 00:18:20.766
[ADMIN B] We'll have to
keep making adjustments.

00:18:20.808 --> 00:18:22.310
[ADMINS groan]

00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:27.064
Oh, hey. What's that thing?

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:29.275
[MARKUS]
Uh, it's a--

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:34.572
Whoa, so cool!

00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:36.407
[MARKUS] Um, as long
as it's within sight,

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:38.492
we can tell what types
of traps have been reset

00:18:38.534 --> 00:18:41.412
a-and the monsters'
overall strength.

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:43.914
It's a little boring
just waiting around.

00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:45.291
Settled in already?

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:48.544
Well, I've been to Maple
Tree lots of times before.

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:50.630
Says a lot about how many
times Sally's beaten you

00:18:50.671 --> 00:18:51.922
at your own game.

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:53.174
[RISA laughs]

00:18:53.215 --> 00:18:54.884
It looks like we might
have a visitor.

00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:11.150
Those might make it
all the way in here.

00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:13.277
They're much stronger
than yesterday's.

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:14.445
Yo, Payne!

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:16.030
There's work to do!

00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:17.198
Right.

00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:19.784
I'm more than happy to do
my fair share of work.

00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:21.410
[MII]
I'll go, as well.

00:19:21.452 --> 00:19:24.455
Everybody else should
rest up for later.

00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:27.083
Don't be stingy with
your strength, Payne.

00:19:27.124 --> 00:19:28.751
Please. I'd never.

00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:30.252
[FREDERICA]
All right!

00:19:30.294 --> 00:19:32.838
Here. Just a few quick
buffs for the road.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.215
You two behave!

00:19:34.256 --> 00:19:36.258
[KAEDE]
Bye! Be careful, okay?

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:44.975
Ignis! Phoenix Flame!
Become Fire!

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:46.602
Ray, use Torrent of Light!

00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:48.270
Now then, Release All Magic!

00:19:55.986 --> 00:19:57.571
Karmic Fire of Carnage!

00:19:57.613 --> 00:19:59.281
Holy Dragon Light Blade!

00:20:16.924 --> 00:20:19.218
C'mon!
What's wrong with you two?

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.221
You took out Markus's camera
along with the monsters!

00:20:22.263 --> 00:20:25.307
[PAYNE] I didn't know the buff
extended our range. Sorry.

00:20:25.349 --> 00:20:27.685
Um, yeah. Apologies.

00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:30.062
[MARKUS] They destroyed
my super rare item.

00:20:30.104 --> 00:20:32.773
I'm deeply sorry for
your loss, Markus.

00:20:32.815 --> 00:20:34.692
[MARKUS] Not to mention,
it's going to take forever

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:36.694
to reset everything.

00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:37.820
What do I do?

00:20:37.862 --> 00:20:39.739
[RISA]
Eh. He has a point.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.032
It'll be pretty inefficient to
keep resetting our traps

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:43.659
and cameras every time.

00:20:43.701 --> 00:20:45.453
So what should we do?

00:20:45.494 --> 00:20:48.080
I think we can intercept
most of the monsters.

00:20:48.122 --> 00:20:49.832
Looking at the ones
Payne and Mii fought,

00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:52.668
I feel pretty confident we
can handle their strength.

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:54.503
True. Well, then.

00:20:54.545 --> 00:20:56.547
We should go out
and conquer dungeons.

00:20:56.589 --> 00:20:59.258
We'll secure as many
medals as possible.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.385
[KAEDE]
What? You want us to go outside?

00:21:01.427 --> 00:21:03.512
It's a good idea, considering
the way we were all

00:21:03.554 --> 00:21:05.389
forcibly relocated today.

00:21:05.431 --> 00:21:07.266
It's highly likely that
something similar could happen

00:21:07.308 --> 00:21:08.601
again tomorrow.

00:21:08.642 --> 00:21:11.979
Between yesterday and today,
which one was more dangerous?

00:21:12.021 --> 00:21:13.606
We need to be prepared.

00:21:13.647 --> 00:21:16.317
Ha. So, you had the
same idea, huh?

00:21:16.358 --> 00:21:18.486
We lost a lot of our
guild members today,

00:21:18.527 --> 00:21:20.154
but we still need
to be proactive.

00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:22.823
All righty! You can
count on our help, too!

00:21:22.865 --> 00:21:24.575
Hold up. Seriously?

00:21:26.243 --> 00:21:28.120
It'll be easier to fight
that way, right?

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.791
Well, you heard
our guild master.

00:21:31.832 --> 00:21:33.000
What do you guys say?

00:21:35.002 --> 00:21:36.212
[PAYNE, MII]
We accept.

00:21:39.632 --> 00:21:41.467
[KAEDE]
Okay, so here's the plan.

00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:44.553
May, Yui, Markus, and Dread
will go to the east.

00:21:44.595 --> 00:21:47.389
[SALLY] Meanwhile, Payne,
Misery, Iz, and Kanade

00:21:47.431 --> 00:21:48.891
will go to the west.

00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:51.602
[KAEDE] We'll have Drag,
Shin, Kuromu, and Kasumi

00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:53.062
go to the south.

00:21:53.103 --> 00:21:54.647
Which leaves us four.

00:21:54.688 --> 00:21:58.651
Myself, Maple, Mii, and
Frederica will go north.

00:21:58.692 --> 00:21:59.819
And our group...

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.445
...will stay behind as guards.

00:22:01.487 --> 00:22:03.072
We'll provide base support!

00:22:03.113 --> 00:22:06.867
Just leave those disgusting
base-invading monsters to us!

00:22:06.909 --> 00:22:08.285
[squeals]

00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:10.204
[KAEDE]
Our goal is to get medals!

00:22:10.246 --> 00:22:13.207
Let's get as many as we can
before the night's over!

00:22:13.249 --> 00:22:14.416
[GROUP]
Yeah!
