WEBVTT

00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:10.135
[KAEDE]
Having fun, Syrup?

00:00:10.177 --> 00:00:11.178
[SYRUP]
Turtle!

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.765
[KAEDE laughs]
There. That's better.

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:16.266
Well, what do you think?

00:00:16.308 --> 00:00:18.519
I've been working on
controlling my tentacles!

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.895
You're doing great.

00:00:19.937 --> 00:00:21.605
And obviously you're
enjoying them.

00:00:21.647 --> 00:00:23.023
Good for you!

00:00:23.065 --> 00:00:24.608
You know, those things
might turn out to be

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.652
a useful weapon
in the next event.

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.028
And just think.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.738
By that time, all of us
will have found our

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.448
monster companions.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.326
Kanade, you've given this
some thought, haven't you?

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:36.578
Yeah, I mostly
provide support, so--

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.915
what I'm looking for more than
anything else is versatility.

00:00:39.957 --> 00:00:42.876
One with healing powers would
be the best fit for me.

00:00:42.918 --> 00:00:45.921
But hey, I'm working on
a pretty long quest,

00:00:45.963 --> 00:00:47.923
so I'm sure
something'll turn up.

00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:50.842
Surely not all the monsters
are combat-focused.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.803
Naturally, I'm hoping to
find one that would make

00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:54.721
production work easier.

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:55.931
Oh, boy.

00:00:55.973 --> 00:00:58.183
Finding a monster companion
is pretty complicated

00:00:58.225 --> 00:00:59.351
business, huh?

00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:00.686
It sure is.

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:03.897
Of course, in our cases, the
perfect companions found us.

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:05.524
Guess we're pretty lucky.

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.442
She's right, isn't she, Syrup?

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:08.527
[SYRUP]
Turtle!

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:11.113
Once all of us have our
monsters, it'll be much easier

00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:13.031
to travel together.

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:16.243
So let's plan to finish
this up today!

00:01:16.285 --> 00:01:18.328
I'm gonna take a
look around town.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.955
Hey, that's not a bad idea!

00:01:19.997 --> 00:01:22.541
Just in case there are
any quests available.

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:24.418
[KAEDE]
All right! Good luck!

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:25.502
[SYRUP]
Turtle!

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:02.933
Well, I searched the library
for leads on potential

00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:07.187
monster companions, but I
came up pretty much empty.

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:10.273
So I guess I'll just keep
walking around for now.

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:15.737
I feel like I recognize just
about all these faces

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:17.447
from previous visits.

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.325
I know that player's
been here before.

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:24.329
I've spotted those two
NPCs at least twice now.

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:27.708
And sure enough,
I know those guys, too.

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:29.751
[BLAZING BRO A] We're gonna need
one full set of healing items,

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:31.294
as well.

00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:34.047
I'm pretty sure that's
everything Dread asked for.

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:36.591
Which means we can finally
move on to Drag's list.

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:39.094
Ah! What a magnificent bouquet!

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:41.179
A perfect gift for Frederica!

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:43.807
You'll just get yelled
at for wasting money.

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.017
'Course, if you wanna spend
your own, that's on you.

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:53.400
[KANADE]
Huh?

00:03:53.442 --> 00:03:55.694
Haven't seen that NPC before.

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:17.674
[KANADE sighs]

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:20.886
I really thought there'd
be something to find.

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:24.890
Just an ordinary house, huh?

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.224
Yeah, as if.

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:30.645
Huh? Here we are.

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:32.606
There's something
about these books.

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:35.776
Found you!

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:37.027
Let's see now.

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:42.115
Ooh, a "Mirror Slime"! How cool.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:46.620
Right. I see.

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:48.079
"Mirror Image," huh?

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:53.543
I know exactly where
I'm supposed to go.

00:04:57.214 --> 00:04:59.299
Hope it turns out to be
something along the lines of

00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:00.759
what I'm expecting.

00:05:05.514 --> 00:05:06.932
Looks like a dead end.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.684
Huh?

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:19.653
Nice try!

00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:20.862
Now, Spell Stash!

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:34.835
Interesting. This might be a
bit more difficult I thought.

00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:38.797
Magic Fire Bullet!
Voice of the Dead!

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:41.758
Anti-Sorcery Barrier!
Robe of Blessing!

00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:47.973
Anti-Magic! Mana Flight!
Power Decay!

00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:50.851
Power Decay!

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:53.728
Wish I could use it as
enthusiastically as you do!

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.441
Firestorm! All Resist!
Summon Decoy!

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:04.906
Breath of Destruction! Divine
Punishment! Gravity Axe!

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:16.626
Hello there!

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:18.753
According to this, all I
have to do is activate

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:23.049
50 spells or skills, and it'll
become my companion. Huh.

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:24.301
I guess that makes sense.

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:26.303
The book did say it was
driven to transform into

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:28.930
other creatures by its
thirst for knowledge.

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:32.183
I bet you're just brimming
with curiosity, aren't you?

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.060
Okay, let's get this over with.

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:35.228
Pay attention!

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.028
[KANADE]
And that should do it!

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:49.951
Another quest complete! Yes!

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:51.620
Now, let's see your stats.

00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:56.166
It's stronger than I thought.

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:59.377
This one time,
I'm happy to be wrong.

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.255
From here on out,
your name will be "Sou."

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:06.509
Now, Sou. Mimic!

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.517
What's this, now?

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:17.896
Apparently, your skill strength
amounts to half of my own.

00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:19.022
Oh, well.

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:21.650
That's not your real value.

00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:23.860
Happy to have you, Sou.

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:31.910
[IZ]
Hmm.

00:07:31.952 --> 00:07:35.205
Sounds like even the non-rare
monsters are pretty strong.

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:37.582
Hopefully at least one of
them will suit my needs.

00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:43.838
"A Recently Discovered
Spirit-Type Monster?"

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:53.056
[IZ]
Hello there!

00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:54.933
If you're standing at my door,

00:07:54.975 --> 00:07:58.103
you must be seeking out
the power of the spirits.

00:07:58.144 --> 00:07:59.187
[IZ]
Mm-hmm.

00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:02.774
[BLACKSMITH]
Fine.

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:05.610
You seem to have some degree
of competence, anyway.

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:06.903
Wait here a second.

00:08:08.989 --> 00:08:12.367
[IZ] "Three Trials."
So I'm gonna have to boost

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:15.120
the three designated items
to maximum strength.

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.913
And, in addition to that,
imbue each of them

00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:19.165
with the specified abilities.

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:20.792
That sounds pretty difficult.

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:24.504
[BLACKSMITH] Here. Follow
these instructions carefully.

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:28.133
[IZ] Uh-oh. I don't recognize
any of these items.

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:30.468
The spirits are
quite fickle beings.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.220
Should they agree
to lend you their aid,

00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:34.639
you'll be able to accomplish
incredible things.

00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:36.391
But first, you'll have
to demonstrate yourself

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:38.226
to be a worthy master.

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:39.269
Understood.

00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:47.068
[IZ] These materials are
all high difficulty level.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.404
This could be a struggle
on my own.

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:52.532
[KAEDE]
Hey, Iz! Over here!

00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:54.951
[IZ]
Hey there, Maple!

00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:57.328
What's up? Recon going well?

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.707
Yeah! Mii invited me to
do some leveling up today.

00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:02.709
We were actually just
about to head out.

00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:04.419
Oh, that's wonderful!

00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:06.838
But I guess that means
I can't ask for your help.

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:10.050
[KAEDE]
Really?

00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:13.553
You're going after a monster
no one's been able to tame?

00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:15.263
I like the sound of that.

00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:17.766
Why don't the three
of us go together, huh?

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:19.476
Are you sure, Mii?

00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:22.353
Sounds like a pretty
challenging expedition to me,

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:24.731
which means it should
be good for leveling.

00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:27.275
And... [chuckles]

00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:29.027
As a bonus, I get
to observe members

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:31.029
of a rival guild in action.

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:32.280
Thanks a lot!

00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:34.616
Then I guess we can head
out whenever you're ready!

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:36.659
Yeah! Sounds like a plan!

00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:37.952
[MII]
Let's get to it.

00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:39.662
So what's our first destination?

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:41.206
A volcano.

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:43.416
Looks like it's pretty
far from the city.

00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:45.585
Syrup can carry us no problem!

00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:49.255
That's one thought, but I
have an even better idea.

00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:50.673
Check this out.

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:52.300
Ignis! Awaken!

00:09:58.181 --> 00:09:59.265
[KAEDE]
Ah!

00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:01.434
Mii, is this your
monster companion?

00:10:01.476 --> 00:10:03.770
Guess they modeled it
on the legendary phoenix!

00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:05.230
Ah!

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.065
It's super cool!

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:08.399
Isn't it, though?

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:10.360
Ignis! Use Megamorph!

00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:19.786
It goes so fast!

00:10:19.828 --> 00:10:21.955
At this rate, we're gonna
be there in no time.

00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:26.000
Hey, you're pretty fired up!

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.964
Well, I was excited to
see what you thought. So?

00:10:31.005 --> 00:10:32.257
[KAEDE]
It's amazing!

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:40.014
[KAEDE]
So this is it?

00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:42.475
[MII] Don't worry.
I know this place well.

00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:44.018
Ignis. Return.

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:49.440
[KAEDE] So um, what is it
we're looking for again?

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.901
[IZ] Mostly a bunch of
different ores and plants,

00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:54.779
plus one item dropped by
the boss, the Lava Dragon.

00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:55.822
Whoa.

00:10:55.864 --> 00:10:58.199
There are plants growing
inside a volcano?

00:10:58.241 --> 00:11:01.494
I believe it's a red plant
that could be easy to miss.

00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:02.954
Let's keep our eyes peeled.

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:07.876
[IZ]
There they are!

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:11.379
This one here,
and that one, and this.

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:14.090
[MII] Monsters could start
showing up any time now.

00:11:14.132 --> 00:11:15.008
Watch out.

00:11:15.049 --> 00:11:17.010
But Mii, since it's
fire element,

00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:19.262
then how well-suited
are you to take them on?

00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:20.889
Uh, not very.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.184
But the experience
ratio here is perfect.

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:25.894
Great leveling opportunity.

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:32.442
Let's knock them
out quickly, Ignis!

00:11:32.483 --> 00:11:34.194
I'll use Linked Flame!

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:45.246
You're done for!
Loving Sacrifice!

00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:47.165
And Syrup, awaken, now!

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:49.751
Deploy Cannon! Right Hand!

00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:51.628
Syrup, Spirit Cannon!

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:58.593
Hydra! Commence Attack!
Take that!

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:05.433
They can't compete
with my firepower!

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:07.602
Heavy Fire! Blue Fire!

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:15.985
Oh, wow! That was so impressive!

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:17.612
My turn now! Ha!

00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:27.288
[MII] That was a pretty
effective attack.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.333
Of course, it was nothing
compared to your defense.

00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:31.918
Yeah, you're right.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.920
And you know,
I've been using Hydra

00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:35.922
since I started
playing the game.

00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:38.007
Well, don't go
getting any stronger.

00:12:38.049 --> 00:12:40.009
You'll leave me
behind completely.

00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:42.095
[IZ] Looks like it's
calmed down for now.

00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:43.096
So here.

00:12:43.137 --> 00:12:45.223
Potions made by yours truly.

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:46.766
To thank you, y'know?

00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:51.020
Oh. Amazing.

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:53.231
My MP's fully restored.

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:55.275
What's more, the strength
of my magic attacks

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:56.943
has been boosted.

00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:59.737
Are you sure it was okay
for us to use these?

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.781
I've never seen effects
like this before.

00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:04.450
Like I said,
I crafted them myself,

00:13:04.492 --> 00:13:06.577
so I can always make more.

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:07.620
Of course.

00:13:07.662 --> 00:13:10.498
You're a member of the
legendary Maple Tree, after all.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.251
I should've realized you
were something special.

00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:15.295
I normally play
a supporting role,

00:13:15.336 --> 00:13:17.839
so I'm not quite sure how
to take such kind words.

00:13:26.597 --> 00:13:29.350
Wait, are we gonna take damage
if we walk across here?

00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:32.228
No, there won't be
any terrain damage.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.856
However, the monsters
over there are stronger.

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:38.568
Look!

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:47.827
Loving Sacrifice!

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.288
Deploy Armaments!

00:13:53.791 --> 00:13:55.251
Ignis, go!

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:03.009
Here I come! Let's go!

00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:05.094
Invitation to the Ocean Floor!

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:08.890
[KAEDE yells]

00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:11.517
Take that!

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.481
That skill works really
well with Devour!

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:18.107
You've done it again, Maple!

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:20.360
It's just a shame
it isn't cuter.

00:14:20.401 --> 00:14:23.029
[MII]
Maple! One more blow! Inferno!

00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:28.076
Let's try again!

00:14:31.954 --> 00:14:33.206
In that case.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.085
[MII]
Even more magic power?

00:14:37.126 --> 00:14:38.461
Don't mind if I do!

00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:40.630
And Magic Boost!

00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:42.256
Ignis! Come to me!

00:14:57.522 --> 00:14:59.857
All right. Ignis, Linked Flame!

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:01.109
And Flame!

00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:10.243
Ignis! Holy Phoenix Flame!
Crimson Flame!

00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:15.832
And finally, Heavy Fire!
Blue Fire!

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.092
Thanks so much, both of you!

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:27.760
Let me go retrieve that! Heh!

00:15:28.886 --> 00:15:30.263
You did it, Mii!

00:15:30.304 --> 00:15:32.306
You were incredible!

00:15:32.348 --> 00:15:33.516
Never mind that.

00:15:33.558 --> 00:15:35.309
What's the story with
those tentacles?

00:15:35.351 --> 00:15:36.686
[KAEDE laughs]

00:15:36.727 --> 00:15:39.939
I told you I had something I
wanted to show you, remember?

00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:42.400
Well yeah, but somehow
that's not quite

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:43.860
what I was expecting.

00:15:43.901 --> 00:15:45.945
I wanted to try it
out on a boss!

00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:48.281
Do you think it's a
good finishing move?

00:15:48.322 --> 00:15:49.574
Definitely.

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:50.616
Aw, jeez.

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:53.619
Turns out you're not as short
on firepower as I thought.

00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:55.997
Well then, I guess...

00:15:56.038 --> 00:15:57.999
...I'll have to find
a way to counter it,

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.835
so I can take you on in
the next guild competition.

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:02.003
[KAEDE laughs]

00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:03.671
I look forward to it!

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:05.840
You know, the other
members of Maple Tree

00:16:05.882 --> 00:16:08.259
have gotten a lot stronger, too.

00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:11.387
No kidding. Just look at her.

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:13.598
I thought one of the few
things Maple Tree lacked

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:15.475
was a powerful buffer.

00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:17.602
Clearly, that was my oversight.

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:20.897
I might even go as far as
to say you guys are unrivaled.

00:16:20.938 --> 00:16:22.023
You think?

00:16:22.064 --> 00:16:24.358
I have to say, Iz always
comes through for us!

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:29.197
Right. Okay then, what
else do we need to find?

00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:31.782
The egg of a monster
bird that nests on a cliff,

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:33.910
ice flower from the
snowy mountains,

00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:36.662
venom from a scorpion
that lives among coral

00:16:36.704 --> 00:16:40.082
in the ocean, and a
certain kind of hide, too.

00:16:40.124 --> 00:16:42.293
That list is really intense.

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:45.171
Yep. So we might as
well attack it head-on.

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:46.339
You're the best!

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.508
You mind if we
start with the cliff?

00:16:48.549 --> 00:16:50.635
Sure thing. Leave it to us!

00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:00.228
[KUROMU grunts]

00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:02.271
This quest is longer
than I thought.

00:17:04.398 --> 00:17:07.485
It's taken me to ten
different places.

00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:09.487
I've gotta be getting
close to the end.

00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:22.333
[KUROMU] So this next
stretch is horror themed.

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:24.669
Considering how drawn-out
the quest has been,

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.380
I figure I'll get a pretty
strong monster out of it.

00:17:29.006 --> 00:17:31.425
Hope it's not a ghost
or undead monster.

00:17:31.467 --> 00:17:33.219
Sally would totally freak out.

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:37.098
Sure enough, here they come.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.570
[KUROMU] Ah, looks like
we've got a new one!

00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:52.780
Revitalize!

00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:54.156
Shield Attack!

00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:03.624
With Revitalize active,
I can't be taken down!

00:18:05.793 --> 00:18:07.503
I've been trying to
achieve a different kind

00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:09.922
of durability than Maple's.

00:18:09.964 --> 00:18:12.091
But if all I do is keep
coming back every time

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:15.553
I get killed, then what
difference is there between

00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:17.305
me and a zombie?

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:23.978
This must be the boss's lair.

00:18:27.398 --> 00:18:28.899
Guard Aura!

00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:33.154
So which of us
will be left standing?

00:18:33.195 --> 00:18:34.864
Only one way to find out!

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.421
[KUROMU]
Flame Slash!

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.646
[KUROMU]
That was easier than expected.

00:19:06.687 --> 00:19:08.147
Let's see now.

00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:10.816
There's gotta be some treasure
lying around here, right?

00:19:18.282 --> 00:19:20.993
[KUROMU]
Oh! Not a bad haul.

00:19:21.035 --> 00:19:22.912
Still, there must be
more to it than this.

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:26.040
Huh?

00:19:27.458 --> 00:19:30.002
Huh. Well, what do we have here?

00:19:30.044 --> 00:19:31.921
Let's put you on
and see what happens.

00:19:33.214 --> 00:19:34.215
Huh?

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:40.971
You must be the monster
that's bonded to this ring.

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:43.391
So uh... Armored?

00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:54.443
[BLACKSMITH sighs]

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.655
Ah.

00:19:57.697 --> 00:19:58.948
Excellent work.

00:19:58.989 --> 00:20:01.701
You've shown yourself worthy to
receive the aid of the spirits.

00:20:01.742 --> 00:20:02.743
[IZ laughs]

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:06.622
Here.

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:10.084
Place this upon your finger
and go stand on that circle.

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:21.387
[FAY]
Fay.

00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:26.225
[BLACKSMITH] What you
see before you is a spirit.

00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:28.227
The nature of their power
varies depending on

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:29.437
where they're found.

00:20:29.478 --> 00:20:31.564
Use the terrain and magic
to your advantage

00:20:31.605 --> 00:20:34.066
to skillfully control
those powers.

00:20:34.108 --> 00:20:35.609
--[FAY] Fay.
--[IZ] Huh.

00:20:35.651 --> 00:20:38.362
So it's kind of like
elemental magic?

00:20:38.404 --> 00:20:41.115
Why, hello there!
My name is Iz.

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:43.451
I believe I'll call you Fay.

00:20:43.492 --> 00:20:45.411
Nice to meet you, friend!

00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:46.662
[FAY]
Fay?

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.665
[KAEDE]
Congratulations!

00:20:49.707 --> 00:20:51.751
Thanks to you and
Mii helping me out,

00:20:51.792 --> 00:20:54.545
I have a wonderful
new friend by my side.

00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:56.714
I'm really happy with Sou.

00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:58.466
I could tell you
what its skills are,

00:20:58.507 --> 00:21:01.594
but I think I'll let it be a
surprise during the next event.

00:21:01.635 --> 00:21:03.262
How exciting!

00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:06.891
Kuromu? What kind of
monster did you find?

00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:08.809
[KUROMU]
Here, I'll show you.

00:21:08.851 --> 00:21:09.894
Necro!

00:21:13.564 --> 00:21:16.442
Sorry, Sally.
Just try to power through.

00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:20.070
I present my companion.
Its name is Necro.

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:21.781
Oh. It's fine.

00:21:21.822 --> 00:21:24.408
Nothing to worry
about over here.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:29.914
So uh, yeah. Necro.
That armor is pretty cool.

00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:31.373
[KUROMU]
Oh, that's great!

00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:33.584
In that case, I'll show
you what it can do!

00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:34.794
Armored!

00:21:55.189 --> 00:21:57.483
So yeah.

00:22:00.653 --> 00:22:03.656
You look so cool, Kuromu!

00:22:03.697 --> 00:22:05.032
[KUROMU]
I know, right?

00:22:05.074 --> 00:22:07.993
It gives my durability
a serious boost, too.

00:22:08.035 --> 00:22:10.788
I couldn't have asked for
a better partner than this!

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.249
Welcome aboard, Necro!

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:14.667
Boys will be boys.

00:22:14.708 --> 00:22:16.043
[FAY]
Fay.
