WEBVTT

00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:11.512
So fast!

00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:15.516
[KAEDE] Just look at how far
we've come in no time at all!

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:18.477
It's super handy to have a
tamed monster that can fly.

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:20.729
The ground may be
crawling with monsters,

00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:23.190
but up here, we're
safe and sound!

00:00:23.232 --> 00:00:26.777
True. Sadly, our destination
is still pretty far away.

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:29.363
Yeah. Even with the
map scaled way down,

00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:31.490
I still can't see the
edge of the field.

00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:33.242
Let's move fast before
the north dungeon

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:34.535
gets swallowed up, too.

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:36.787
I hope our base is doing okay.

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:41.124
[MONSTERS laughing]

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:47.714
How'd it look?

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:49.633
[BLAZING BROTHER B] Got quite
a few of them out there.

00:00:49.675 --> 00:00:51.134
[BLAZING BROTHER C]
It's just a matter of time

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:52.344
before they come after us.

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:53.720
[BLAZING BROTHER A]
I thought so.

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:55.722
Well, what should we do?

00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:58.350
A few traps are scattered
throughout the cave.

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:01.478
We will survive as long
as we stay here.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.063
Right, I hear you.

00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:05.399
You wanna repay Maple's
group for their help.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.858
Keeping the area
around the base safe

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.861
from attacks sounds good to me.
You count me in, sis!

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:13.198
Oh, my! That is a truly
beautiful sentiment!

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.867
I'm in. I think we all
deserve a little time

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.120
in the spotlight. Right?

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:18.996
True!

00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:21.665
It's like they say, the best
defense is a good offense!

00:01:21.707 --> 00:01:23.208
Is everyone in agreement?

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.294
I say we take the initiative!

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:27.504
All right, then let's go!

00:01:27.546 --> 00:01:29.673
[ALL]
Yeah!

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:35.929
[ALL yelling]

[BLAZING BROTHERS]
Nope! We couldn't do it!

[DREAD]
You girls are scary.

00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:35.132
[MARCUS] You should see it
from up here, it's even worse.

00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:37.634
[DREAD] Look alive! We should
be getting close to where

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:39.845
Sally said the dungeon would be.

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:43.098
[MARCUS]
Hey, you think that's it?

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.725
[TSUKIMI]
Bear!

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:48.353
[DREAD]
So far, so good.

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:56.111
Now, Clear. Invisibility!

00:03:58.363 --> 00:04:00.031
[MAY, YUI gasping]

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.325
Does this mean
nobody can see us?

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:03.201
[MARCUS]
Mm.

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:05.245
But it doesn't work
on every monster,

00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:07.956
so you still have
to be careful, 'kay?

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:10.709
[DREAD]
Huh?

00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:12.794
[MAY, YUI gasping]

00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:16.840
[MARCUS]
This is... one of those things

00:04:16.882 --> 00:04:19.968
where they all attack us as
soon as they sense us, isn't it?

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.720
So, what should we do?

00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:24.139
I'm not sure we can handle
that much at one time.

00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:27.100
It'll be difficult for us to
beat that many monsters.

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:30.395
[DREAD]
I've got this. Shadow. Awaken!

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:31.813

Everybody ready? Shadow World!

00:04:34.858 --> 00:04:36.401
[MAY, YUI scream]

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:38.278
Oh, wow...

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.821
Look up there!

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:42.491
[MAY gasping]

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:44.618
Follow me, we're gonna
cut across thing.

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:46.536
[MAY, YUI]
Uh, right!

00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:54.002
[DREAD] All right,
one pointless fight avoided.

00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:56.421
[MARCUS chuckles]
Now I know that if I ever set

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:59.341
a trap for you, you'll probably
just slip right through it.

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:01.218
Wow, you're amazing, Dread!

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.095
You saved us!
Thank you very much!

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:06.723
Eh, it's cool. Plus,
you're not off the hook

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:08.683
since I'm gonna need
your massive firepower

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:12.103

That's for sure.

Okay, time for the big fight.

Maybe around 30 seconds,
if we're lucky.

Uh, not sure. Um, five, I think?

Great, Dread and the others
have conquered the dungeon.

00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:56.977
Not surprising. And since
they did it so fast,

00:07:57.018 --> 00:07:59.562

done their part to help out.

like Sally told us.

[KANADE] It definitely has
a dungeon vibe to it, huh?

00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:17.580
[PAYNE]
Yes. This must be it.

00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:24.045
Huh? We went straight
to the boss room.

00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:26.131
At least it wasn't hard to find.

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:28.466
[PAYNE]
Shall we enter? Misery.

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:31.970
Right. And if it ends up being
a trap, then I'll be ready

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:34.222
with damage nullification
and healing magic.

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:35.598

I get it. It's one of those.

00:08:50.113 --> 00:08:53.033
It's the type of enemy that can
summon other monsters.

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:54.492
I'm also willing
to bet that they'll

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:56.161
probably have
long-range attacks.

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:58.580
Well, at least we have
a plan for this scenario.

00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:01.499

[KANADE]
That was pretty easy.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.897
Yes, and it seems we had the
correct combination of members.

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:08.024
I got a little nervous when
the summoned monsters

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:11.111
suddenly multiplied, but
we still managed to win!

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:14.489
[gasps] And it appears
we've just received a medal.

00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:15.615
What now?

We've still got more time
before the sun sets.

00:10:18.409 --> 00:10:20.411
We'll try searching
for the next dungeon.

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:24.165
With four of us, I'm sure we
could handle a few more.

00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:25.625
--[KANADE] Yeah!
--[IZ] Right!

00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:33.466

That's one hell of a sandstorm.

We won't be able to see
any monsters in this.

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:37.846
They could sneak up on us.

your Split-Sword to help?

If anything's out there,
I'll detect it.

00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:48.523
Worth a shot. Split Sword!

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:50.733
Surround Formation!

00:10:57.282 --> 00:10:58.283
[SHIN]
Hm.

00:10:58.324 --> 00:10:59.909
There is something out there.

00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:02.370
Fortunately, I don't
think it's a monster.

00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:04.497
[KUROMU]
Guess we'll keep moving, then.

00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:06.749
'Kay. You can uncoil now.

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:07.959
[HAKU hisses]

[KUROMU grunting]

00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:22.182
This it?

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:24.684
Seems so. Good job, Kuromu.

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:26.603
We finally hit the jackpot, eh?

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:29.731
[KUROMU]
Yep. It's a dungeon entrance.

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:34.402
[SHIN grunting]

00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:37.572
Gotta say, walking on
swords is a new one.

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:39.741
[SHIN]
I got the idea from Maple.

00:11:39.782 --> 00:11:41.159
She taught me that
skills can be used

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:43.953
in all sorts of unique ways.

00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:45.622
[SHIN grunting]

00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:48.333
[SHIN]
We made it through.

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:49.918
[KUROMU]
Nothing's here.

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:52.962
[SHIN]
Wait. Check out that sand pile.

00:11:56.633 --> 00:11:58.760
We just found the bosses.

00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:01.679
Earth! Shaking Earth!

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:05.225

[KASUMI grunts]

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:22.742
Ah! Hey! Be careful, Kasumi!

00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:26.996
Damn it! Got no choice.
Earth, it's time for Earth Rage!

00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:29.457
[EARTH grunts]

Blood Blade!

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:51.312
They've shifted!

00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:52.897
It doesn't matter!

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:55.191
We'll just take them
head-on instead!

00:12:55.233 --> 00:12:57.235
[KUROMU]
I'll keep them busy!

00:12:57.277 --> 00:12:59.195
The rest of you,
finish them off!

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:01.489
[SHIN] Got it! Let's start
with the scorpion!

Warrior Arms. Iron... Cutter!

00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:30.059
One left! Let's go!

00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:31.227
Right!

00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:36.107
[KASUMI, SHIN grunt, yell]

[SNAKE MONSTER A hisses]

00:13:44.699 --> 00:13:47.160
Well, that was over
quicker than I expected.

00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:50.496
What now? You guys wanna
hit up another spot?

00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:51.789
[DRAG]
Sounds good to me.

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:53.791
Though, with that sandstorm,

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:56.169
we'd be putting Kuromu
through even more trouble.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.171
[KUROMU]
I wouldn't call it trouble.

00:13:58.212 --> 00:14:00.548
I'll use my great shield
to split the sand

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.133
so we can keep moving.

00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:08.222

Stupid monsters!

00:14:22.236 --> 00:14:24.864
Ugh, we've been
fighting forever.

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:27.450
There's probably
a dungeon close by.

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:31.037
Oh. Another medal?
They're fast, huh?

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:33.998
Then we must hurry as well.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.918
[RISA]
Look! What's that?

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:39.754
[GARGOYLE MONSTERS laughing]

00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:42.382
You guys think it's the entrance
to the dungeon?

00:14:42.423 --> 00:14:44.008
Wanna try to move closer?

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:47.303
We'll be fine as long as
Maple's protecting us, right?

00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:49.263
Yeah, but I'm scared
of what'll happen

00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:51.557
if something uses
a piercing attack.

00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:54.769
Although, we might be okay
if we just fly straight into it.

00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:57.313
Fly in... on you...?

00:14:57.355 --> 00:15:00.733
Yep, on me!
You can all just grab on!

00:15:00.775 --> 00:15:04.487
[FREDERICA] Whoa. I didn't
know it could fly, too.

00:15:06.864 --> 00:15:08.616
That's convenient, huh?

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:11.786
Does it have wings somewhere
because I sure don't see any.

00:15:11.828 --> 00:15:14.414
[KAEDE]
Hold on tight everyone!

00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:16.124
[FREDERICA]
Um, like this?

00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:17.625
[MII]
Right. This good?

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:19.752
Yup! Your turn, Sally!

Right. We're ready to launch.

Hold on, "launch"?

00:15:26.467 --> 00:15:28.803
[gasps] I just realized
the thing that almost

00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:31.389
crushed us to death during the
guild competition was this.

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:33.850

00:15:35.059 --> 00:15:39.939

Nice landing, right?

00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:50.074
I saw my game life flash
before my eyes. Am I alive?

Hey! I thought it would be
normal flying Sally. Ugh!

00:15:55.663 --> 00:15:57.915
[RISA] C'mon, I made it
so you wouldn't fall.

00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.209
[FREDERICA] That was not
my point and you know it!

00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:01.586
Shh!

00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:21.606
Yikes! A fake Maple?

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:23.733
Wait. Uh, you mean me?

00:16:23.774 --> 00:16:27.111
Well, to be fair,
it's quite Maple-esque.

Keep your guard up.

00:16:50.885 --> 00:16:54.764
Maple, I think it's time for
that special-once-a-day skill.

00:16:54.805 --> 00:16:57.934
Huh! Great idea! Atrocity!

[ALIEN-LIKE MONSTER A roars]

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:08.694
Ugh... I only have
bad memories of that.

00:17:11.113 --> 00:17:15.034
[KAEDE] Ah! Oh, no.
An Armor-piercing attack?

to get trampled!

wanna back up a few feet!

00:18:23.477 --> 00:18:25.855
So cool.

00:18:25.896 --> 00:18:27.356
Let's finish this!

00:18:27.398 --> 00:18:30.067

[KAEDE] Great job, everyone!
That was a huge success!

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:33.589
Yes. Seems it went well
for your group, too.

00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:34.840
It was easy for us.

00:19:34.882 --> 00:19:36.634
But that's not too
surprising since

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:37.968
we had Payne in our group.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.595
Everyone was so strong!

00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:42.723
And that's how we
were able to win!

Base Defenders. Thank you, too!
Did things go well?

00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:48.979
Yep! We stayed and
protected the base

00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:51.565
and definitely didn't
lose to any monsters.

00:19:51.607 --> 00:19:54.068
Yes, precisely!
We fulfilled our duty

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.821
without any sort of
incident whatsoever.

00:19:58.364 --> 00:20:00.950
That's great!
We were able to get

00:20:00.991 --> 00:20:03.077
a ton of medals thanks
to all of your help!

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:05.287
Thanks a lot, guys!

00:20:05.329 --> 00:20:08.165
Please. If anything,
we should be thanking you.

00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:10.710
Fighting together proved
to be a smart strategy.

00:20:11.752 --> 00:20:13.879
[SECRETARY A] They've
collected a lot of medals.

00:20:13.921 --> 00:20:14.964
[ADMIN A]
Yes.

00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:16.674
But if we make the
monsters stronger than

00:20:16.716 --> 00:20:19.301
Maple and her friends,
it wouldn't be very fair.

00:20:19.343 --> 00:20:21.262
The normal players
wouldn't stand a chance

00:20:21.303 --> 00:20:23.514
against enemies of that caliber.

00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:24.890
[ADMIN B]
To make things even worse,

00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:27.977
they're all on the alert for
nighttime attacks now, too.

00:20:28.018 --> 00:20:29.645
[ADMIN C]
Why are they so active?

00:20:29.687 --> 00:20:31.731
It may be a game, but
they should at least try

00:20:31.772 --> 00:20:33.524
and rest a little
during the night.

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:35.192
[ADMIN A]
So should we.

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:36.944
[ADMIN D] You're right, but
our problem right now is

00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:39.780
the third day. If they get
any additional medals,

00:20:39.822 --> 00:20:42.700
we'll be stuck working
even more overtime!

00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:43.784
[ADMINS groan]

00:20:43.826 --> 00:20:45.244
[ADMIN A]
Uh, don't worry!

00:20:45.286 --> 00:20:48.456
I'm sure our next creation
will serve us well.

00:20:48.497 --> 00:20:52.001
[ALIEN-LIKE MONSTER B growls]

00:20:52.042 --> 00:20:53.919
[SECRETARY A]
Entering day three in:

00:20:53.961 --> 00:20:59.341
five, four, three, two, one.

00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:05.097
[KAEDE]
Well, it's the third day now.

00:21:05.139 --> 00:21:06.807
What's gonna happen?

00:21:06.849 --> 00:21:07.850
If I had to guess,

00:21:07.892 --> 00:21:10.978
it might be even worse
than the first two days.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.438
[KUROMU] We've already
got more than enough

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.191
medals, though. Now all
we have to do is survive

00:21:15.232 --> 00:21:16.984
to the end and we're golden.

00:21:17.026 --> 00:21:19.987
We could just lay low in
here all day if we wanted.

00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:23.532
True. It sort of reminds me
of the second event.

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:28.871
Whoa. Sally, look over there!

00:21:28.913 --> 00:21:31.624
[ALIEN-LIKE MONSTER B roars]

00:21:31.665 --> 00:21:34.335
Um, isn't that the gate
we went into yesterday?

00:21:34.376 --> 00:21:36.712
Looks like it.
It's the third day,

00:21:36.754 --> 00:21:39.381
so we might see a
lot of those gates.

00:21:47.348 --> 00:21:51.560
This is bad. If an entire
group of those attack us,

00:21:51.602 --> 00:21:54.480
keeping everybody alive
will not be a simple task.

00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:56.398
[BLAZING BROTHERS gasping]

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.026
It might be dangerous
to stay here.

00:21:59.068 --> 00:22:01.237
There wouldn't be a way
to escape them.

00:22:01.278 --> 00:22:03.531
True. To add to that point--

00:22:03.572 --> 00:22:06.492
even more powerful monsters
will show up toward the end.

00:22:06.534 --> 00:22:09.495
Being flexible in our movements
would be a smart move.

00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:11.539
[GROUP grunts]

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:15.209
All right! This time, we're
all going out on the attack!
