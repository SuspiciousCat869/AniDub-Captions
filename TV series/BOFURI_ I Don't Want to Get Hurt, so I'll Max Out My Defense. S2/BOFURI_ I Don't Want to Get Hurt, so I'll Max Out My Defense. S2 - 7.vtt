WEBVTT

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:17.351
What should we do today, Maple?

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:19.019
Good question.

00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:29.279
I found you!

00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:30.656
Frederica?

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.032
What's going on?

00:00:32.074 --> 00:00:33.659
[FREDERICA]
Let's have a duel!

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.452
Y'know, like we always do!

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:37.204
Haven't you learned
your lesson yet?

00:00:37.246 --> 00:00:38.413
Ha ha ha!

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:41.291
Enjoy that feeling of
confidence while you still can!

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:45.504
So you also tamed a monster?

00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:48.924
Yes siree!
And a cute one, at that.

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.425
Oh, a cute one.

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:52.970
A cute one, huh? Well.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.735
Okay, just like always.

00:02:31.777 --> 00:02:33.153
Right, like always.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.865
You can do it, Sally!

00:02:36.907 --> 00:02:38.116
Turtle!

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:46.249
All righty, then.

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:47.834
Here we go!

00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:49.086
[RISA]
Super Speed!

00:02:50.462 --> 00:02:51.797
Oboro, use Vanish!

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:53.340
Shadow Clone!

00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:55.008
[FREDERICA gasps]
Uh, Multi--

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.134
And Flash Flood!

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:58.095
Oboro! Binding Barrier!

00:02:58.136 --> 00:03:00.889
[FREDERICA yells]

00:03:00.931 --> 00:03:03.183
Really? I can't move!

00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:07.354
Wait! Hold on a second!

00:03:07.396 --> 00:03:09.231
And now for Quintuple Slash!

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:19.074
[FREDERICA]
What was that?

00:03:19.116 --> 00:03:21.034
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you were really

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:22.327
trying to kill me!

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:23.954
Don't be silly.

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:28.291
And to think, I was going to let
you meet my new companion.

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:30.210
Ooh! What is it? I wanna see!

00:03:30.252 --> 00:03:31.586
Not so fast, Maple!

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:33.380
Fine, I'll show you.

00:03:33.422 --> 00:03:35.257
No, wait. Hang on!

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:36.425
Awaken!

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:42.431
Peep.

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:44.307
[KAEDE]
Aw! How cute!

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.643
I would like you to meet
my friend, Notes.

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:47.853
[NOTES]
Peep, peep!

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:49.187
It's a chick?

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.273
[chuckles]
What's the matter?

00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:54.443
Did you somehow get the idea it
would be something scary?

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:56.027
Frederica, you--!

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.279
Thank goodness!

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.614
Imagine if it had been
a ghost or something.

00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:04.786
Yeah, wouldn't want to run into
one of those things, huh?

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:05.662
Don't worry, though,

00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:08.248
I would never tame an undead
monster for the sole purpose

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.083
of frightening Sally.

00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:11.001
[RISA]
Aw, jeez.

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:13.670
Look at it, Sally! So cute!

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:15.005
And that's not all.

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:17.132
[DORAZOU]
Rawr! Everyone!

00:04:17.174 --> 00:04:20.844
We're pleased to announce the
eighth event is starting soon!

00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:23.263
And this time around,
we'll be holding a preliminary

00:04:23.305 --> 00:04:25.849
before the main event,
which will consist of

00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:28.477
a survival match among
individual players.

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:30.896
Points will be awarded based
on how long you survive

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:33.106
and how many
monsters you defeat.

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:35.567
Preliminary rankings will
then be used to determine

00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:38.153
the area assignments
for the main event.

00:04:38.195 --> 00:04:40.030
Of course, the higher your rank,

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:42.491
the better the
rewards you'll receive!

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:44.534
And since you'll be
competing individually,

00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:46.828
don't forget to bring
a tamed monster!

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:47.954
That's all for now.

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:49.831
More details coming soon!

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:53.710
Competing individually
with a ranking system.

00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:56.129
So far, it sounds a lot
like the first event.

00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:59.508
Let's have a strategy meeting
as soon as we know more.

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:01.051
One thing's for sure.

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:03.929
All of us need to do our
best in the preliminary.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.974
Anyway, setting the event
aside for a brief moment.

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:09.518
How about we go again?

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:12.771
Uh-oh. It's from Payne.

00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:15.106
Huh? You supposed
to be somewhere?

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:15.982
Nuh-uh.

00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:18.693
He just wants me to be careful
not to give too much away.

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:20.862
Oh, well.
I guess I'll be going.

00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:22.823
However, I shall return!

00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:25.784
Fine!
And I'll destroy you again.

00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:27.536
I wouldn't be so sure!

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:30.997
Wait 'til you get a chance to
see what Notes can really do.

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.874
Bye bye!

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:34.793
Bye!

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:36.545
That chick of Frederica's
might have some good

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.380
buff or debuff skills.

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:39.506
[KAEDE]
You think so?

00:05:39.548 --> 00:05:40.966
Kinda makes sense.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:43.134
It doesn't seem to be
an attack specialist

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:45.095
like May and Yui's bears.

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:48.098
I'd say it's more comparable
to the monster Iz found.

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.891
[KAEDE] Yeah, that one
was pretty cute too,

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:50.934
now that you mention it!

00:05:50.976 --> 00:05:52.477
Maybe it's a support chick!

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.897
Well, cuteness aside,
the right monster can enhance

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:58.108
your strengths or
cover your weaknesses.

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:00.694
They're serious game-changers
in that respect.

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:01.945
Yeah, well said.

00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:05.198
What do you want to do now?

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.242
I don't think the others
will be back for a while.

00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:10.203
We haven't hung out just
the two of us for a bit, huh?

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:12.080
Why don't we take the
opportunity to explore

00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:13.164
Level Seven?

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.958
Okay. Like where?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.002
Uh... Good question.

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:20.255
I've already been to the ocean,
and the forest, and the volcano.

00:06:20.297 --> 00:06:22.757
What other areas
might be interesting?

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:24.926
It's like you're
making travel plans.

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:26.970
We could just wander
aimlessly, you know.

00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:29.890
Yeah! We can walk around
together and see what we find!

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:31.641
"Walk," you say?

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:34.311
I guess I could carry you.

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:37.355
Hey! Don't worry, I have
the perfect solution!

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:38.648
Oh, really?

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.442
[SYRUP]
Turtle?

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.861
[KAEDE laughs]
So fast!

00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:44.988
Better make sure you
hold on tight there, Maple!

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.532
Not that you'd suffer
damage if you fell.

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:49.451
This is really amazing, Sally!

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:52.829
Technically, this is a mount as
opposed to a tamed monster.

00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:55.916
It's such a beautiful horse,
and pretty fast, too, huh?

00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:57.250
[KAEDE]
You've done it again!

00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:04.007
I'm looking as hard as I can,

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:06.343
and I don't see any
enemies around here,

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:08.678
which isn't really
ideal for leveling up.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.013
Yeah!

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:12.557
For aimless wandering,
it couldn't be better!

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:43.838
[RISA]
Hmm.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.174
Now, where the
heck did Maple go?

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:48.259
Maple! You there?

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:49.511
[KAEDE]
Here I am!

00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:50.971
Uh, where's "here"?

00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:52.389
[KAEDE]
Here, of course!

00:07:58.728 --> 00:07:59.938
[RISA]
I found you.

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:03.608
What are you doing?

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:04.943
[KAEDE laughs]

00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:06.111
Having fun!

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:07.946
These guys were bouncing
me in the air for a while,

00:08:07.988 --> 00:08:09.698
and now they're
giving me a ride!

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:12.534
So you've pretty much
become their plaything?

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:14.703
If you're curious,
get in here and find out!

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:20.542
It sure is nice to take it
easy every once in a while,

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:21.543
don't you think?

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:24.170
[RISA laughs]

00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:28.091
You take it easy
all the time, though.

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:29.050
[KAEDE]
Huh?

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:30.677
Is that really the
impression I give off?

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:34.139
--Huh? What the--
--[RISA] Maple, get inside!

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:38.935
[BOTH yell]

00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:40.437
[KAEDE]
Getting dizzy...

00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:50.739
Why is the world
spinning around?

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.157
Where are we, anyway?

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.411
Wool Hunting!

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.083
Water. Need water.

00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:15.764
[KAEDE]
Uh-oh.

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:19.559
[KAEDE yells]

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:22.270
Why?!

00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:24.064
Huh? Oh, no, Maple!

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:25.398
Web user!

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.652
[KAEDE yells]

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:31.154
You okay, Maple?

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:32.906
Didn't expect that.

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:35.158
They must've been afraid
you were gonna eat them.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.744
Huh? I would never do that!

00:09:37.786 --> 00:09:39.245
I'm not so sure.

00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:44.876
Maple, did you drop something?

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:47.796
Mm-mm. I'm pretty sure
I've still got all my stuff

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:48.797
right here.

00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:50.173
Yeah, but--

00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:52.634
[KAEDE]
Something's down there!

00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:54.928
What could it be?

00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:57.055
--[SYRUP] Turtle!
--[KAEDE] Hey, Syrup!

00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:04.979
A crystal?

00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:05.897
Okay.

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:07.440
It's the White Key.

00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:09.692
"This is one of three keys
required to unlock a door

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:11.528
somewhere on this level."

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:12.779
This is a key?

00:10:12.821 --> 00:10:14.989
It takes three keys
to unlock this door,

00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:17.033
so that means
there are two more.

00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:19.744
If they're as small as this one,
they won't be easy to find.

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:21.621
Yeah, we need some kind of hint.

00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:22.580
Okay.

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:25.375
We've obviously stumbled
into a quest of some kind.

00:10:25.416 --> 00:10:28.294
Therefore, something must
have happened to trigger it.

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:30.338
But what could it
have possibly been?

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:33.424
[RISA]
Traveling monsters, huh?

00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:37.137
Listen.

00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:39.722
It was those sheep that
originally brought us here,

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:41.683
so let's take a look around.

00:10:41.724 --> 00:10:43.393
And while we're at it,
we'll see if any other

00:10:43.434 --> 00:10:45.562
traveling monsters
happen to cross our path!

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:47.105
Yeah, let's do it!

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:49.065
And if we see any
traveling monsters,

00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:51.109
it'll be a sign that
we're on the right track!

00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:52.861
I mean, who knows
if it'll really turn out

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:54.612
to be that simple?

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:57.115
But hey, it's better than
searching blindly, right?

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:02.203
I believe in you, Sally!

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:14.174
[RISA]
Could that be?

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:22.599
I knew it!

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:38.489
What's that?

00:11:53.504 --> 00:11:55.256
[KAEDE]
A map of Level Seven?

00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:57.300
[RISA] I have to figure this
was intended to be used

00:11:57.342 --> 00:11:59.052
in an event of some kind.

00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:00.929
[KAEDE]
Yeah! Those marks, though.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.680
How weird.
What could they mean?

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:03.556
[RISA]
Look.

00:12:03.598 --> 00:12:05.558
This mark is in the very
same area where we found

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.851
that spring earlier.

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:09.020
One of them must be
our next destination,

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:11.397
and I bet the rest of
them have clues, at least!

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.735
[KANADE]
Interesting map you've got here.

00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:20.865
Are you able to tell
us anything about it?

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:22.325
[KANADE]
Well, actually.

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:25.161
I read something at the library
that could be relevant.

00:12:25.203 --> 00:12:26.537
[RISA]
Yeah? Go on!

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:27.914
[MAY]
What? Really?

00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:30.041
There once were
prosperous cities.

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:31.960
Places where people
could bond with monsters

00:12:32.001 --> 00:12:34.671
at levels far beyond
what we can do now.

00:12:34.712 --> 00:12:35.922
[YUI]
Don't do that!

00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:38.132
If I plot their locations
on this map,

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:39.801
they'd be here and here.

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:44.138
Aww, I guess we lose.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.099
Yeah, I give up.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.976
[KAEDE] Great! Looks like
one of them was right around

00:12:48.017 --> 00:12:49.936
that spring,
so this should help!

00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:52.689
It's lucky for us you happened
to read the right book.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.608
[KANADE] Well, as a matter
of fact, I've read them all.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.151
You've read all the books...

00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:58.486
...in the library?

00:12:58.528 --> 00:12:59.654
They're really interesting.

00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:01.948
And, as you can see, some
of them contain information

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.866
that turns out to
be quite useful.

00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:05.618
I recommend reading them.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.705
Of course, it does
take quite a while.

00:13:08.746 --> 00:13:10.873
You truly never
cease to amaze me.

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:13.543
I don't see us beating
Kanade anytime soon.

00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:14.585
No way.

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:16.629
[RISA] All right, then,
let's get back to it!

00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:20.717
[KAEDE] Right! I'll be looking
forward to good news, okay?

00:13:20.758 --> 00:13:22.010
Good luck, May and Yui!

00:13:22.051 --> 00:13:24.804
You two keep doing your
best against Kanade!

00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:27.265
[MAY, YUI]
Yeah. We'll do our best.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.911
Same setup as the boss
in the second event.

00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:50.997
Maybe the attacks
are the same, too.

00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:54.125
Great! A chance to show just how
much stronger we've gotten!

00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:58.713
Syrup! Mother Nature!

00:13:58.755 --> 00:13:59.881
Thorn Shackles!

00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:01.966
And for good measure,
Sleep Petals!

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:07.472
Path of Water!

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:11.267
And now Quintuple Slash!

00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:13.061
Spirit Cannon!

00:14:13.102 --> 00:14:16.898
Tur... tle!

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:20.443
All right! Deploy Armaments!

00:14:22.737 --> 00:14:25.156
Invitation to the Ocean Floor!

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:26.282
Predator!

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:31.496
[yells]

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:32.663
Devour!

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:34.499
And Seeping Chaos!

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.875
Commence Attack!

00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:46.219
Uh...

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.766
And finally, Hydra!

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:00.858
Yeah! We did it!

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.570
Heh... I feel bad for anyone
who has to PVP with her.

00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:06.572
Huh? Hey, a crystal!

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:10.410
[RISA]
Nice! The Green Key.

00:15:10.451 --> 00:15:13.329
This means we've got two
of the three keys we need.

00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:15.456
We're doing pretty
good, aren't we?

00:15:15.498 --> 00:15:16.457
Okay.

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:19.460
We've still got one more
location from Kanade to check.

00:15:19.502 --> 00:15:21.337
I can't use Devour
anymore today,

00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:22.839
but if you're up for it.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.883
Sure! We've got some time,
so let's go knock it out.

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:26.926
[KAEDE]
Yeah!

00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:33.474
Whoa! What is this?

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:36.310
Such mighty winds.
They could be dangerous.

00:15:36.352 --> 00:15:38.563
[KAEDE]
And here it comes, right on cue!

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:41.149
[KAEDE yells]

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:42.483
[RISA]
Maple!

00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:46.195
You flew pretty far.
Are you okay?

00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:47.613
A little shaken.

00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:50.491
But the good news is it wasn't
piercing or terrain damage,

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:51.492
so I'm fine.

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:53.453
[RISA chuckles]
Thank goodness for that.

00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:12.221
Looks strong.

00:16:12.263 --> 00:16:13.556
We better not mess around!

00:16:13.598 --> 00:16:14.932
Just leave it to me!

00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:21.439
[KAEDE]
Hey! No fair, I wasn't ready!

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:24.358
[yells]

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.027
[RISA] I don't think there's
any way I can save you

00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:27.320
from that one.

00:16:27.361 --> 00:16:29.197
Whoa! I can't lose focus!

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:34.118
[RISA]
Super Speed!

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.579
Oboro! Fairy Fire! Fire Child!

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:41.584
[RISA]
Yes!

00:16:58.226 --> 00:17:00.436
She's gone full Maple.

00:17:00.478 --> 00:17:03.397
Well, nothing to do but help
out where I can, yeah?

00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:07.902
[RISA]
Power... Attack!

00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:27.630
Oboro, Spirited Away!

00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:47.525
That was great!

00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:49.735
You looked like
a ninja out there!

00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:52.530
[chuckles]
Look! The third key.

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:54.699
Yeah! Awesome! Hooray!

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.493
Shall we head to the ruins
Kanade mentioned?

00:17:57.535 --> 00:17:58.995
[KAEDE]
Let's go!

00:18:20.224 --> 00:18:21.976
Wow, look at that.

00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:24.395
Yeah. Strange place, huh?

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:25.396
Syrup?

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:27.023
Is something wrong?

00:18:27.064 --> 00:18:28.482
What's gotten into them?

00:18:28.524 --> 00:18:29.984
Come on, let's follow Oboro.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.368
[RISA]
Maple, look over there!

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.454
[KAEDE] So many kinds of
creatures I've never seen

00:18:41.495 --> 00:18:42.580
before!

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.112
I'm sensing this
place is important.

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:16.113
Me, too.

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:18.366
And I think there's something
strange about this water.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.245
Nothing weird is
gonna happen right?

00:19:23.287 --> 00:19:24.288
Well, uh--

00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:30.127
Huh?

00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:32.797
What the heck is this?
Syrup, are you okay?

00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:36.842
Oboro?

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.346
Turtle!

00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:48.771
[KAEDE, RISA]
They evolved?

00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:53.818
[KANADE]
Aha! So, they evolved!

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:55.736
A very interesting development!

00:19:55.778 --> 00:19:58.614
Seems like evolving gives
them new skills too.

00:19:58.656 --> 00:20:01.325
You look so stylish
with your new flower!

00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:03.285
And a little bigger
as well, right?

00:20:03.327 --> 00:20:05.287
[SYRUP]
Turtle!

00:20:05.329 --> 00:20:07.373
You've come such a long way.

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:09.625
We've fought a lot of
battles together, huh?

00:20:09.667 --> 00:20:12.169
And maybe they can
go even further.

00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:13.087
You think?

00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:13.963
Sure.

00:20:14.004 --> 00:20:16.799
I haven't seen anything that
mentions evolution limitations.

00:20:16.841 --> 00:20:17.842
Hey, I know.

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:19.385
If evolution makes
them stronger,

00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:21.762
then let's evolve
all our companions!

00:20:21.804 --> 00:20:24.056
I bet if we complete the event.

00:20:24.098 --> 00:20:27.143
Well, that would be ideal
if it were possible.

00:20:27.184 --> 00:20:29.520
[KUROMU] I went to the place
with the floating rocks, too,

00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:31.689
but I didn't run into
any giant there.

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:33.691
I went all the way to
the top of the Great Tree,

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:36.444
but it didn't trigger
any events or battles.

00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:38.362
I wonder why that is.

00:20:38.404 --> 00:20:40.990
Oh, um, maybe it's your
companion's level

00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:42.908
and how close you are to it.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:45.119
Yeah, Maple and Sally have
been with Syrup and Oboro

00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:47.246
for a long time,
so that could be it.

00:20:47.288 --> 00:20:48.372
That's right.

00:20:48.414 --> 00:20:49.623
I think there was
something in the book

00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:51.417
about bringing
out their strengths.

00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:54.587
Maybe you have to level
up their basic abilities first.

00:20:54.628 --> 00:20:57.798
Aw! Then it really is because
we've been together so long!

00:21:03.554 --> 00:21:06.056
[F ADMIN B]
All these blasted new features!

00:21:06.098 --> 00:21:08.058
Bugs are popping up everywhere!

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.143
[ADMIN B]
No point griping.

00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:10.853
Might as well use
that time to work!

00:21:10.895 --> 00:21:13.230
[ADMIN C] Hey, how many rare
monsters have been consumed

00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:14.231
so far?

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:15.649
[SECRETARY]
Fewer than 20 percent.

00:21:15.691 --> 00:21:17.276
Keep in mind it's a large area,

00:21:17.318 --> 00:21:19.278
so there's an abundance
of strong monsters

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.529
who aren't rare as well.

00:21:20.571 --> 00:21:22.740
[ADMIN A] We all worked
so hard to pull this together.

00:21:22.782 --> 00:21:24.158
[F ADMIN B]
How are the major guilds doing?

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.285
[SECRETARY] This one is
swimming in rare monsters.

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:27.328
[ADMIN C]
Impressive!

00:21:27.369 --> 00:21:29.371
[ADMIN B] They're totally
grabbing up all the good stuff.

00:21:29.413 --> 00:21:32.500
[SECRETARY] By the way, how will
you be handling the next event?

00:21:32.541 --> 00:21:34.335
[ADMIN A] When the players
themselves become monsters,

00:21:34.376 --> 00:21:36.837
our monsters have to
be doubly monstrous!

00:21:36.879 --> 00:21:38.339
[ADMIN C]
Yeah, that's the ticket!

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:39.673
Strength in size!

00:21:39.715 --> 00:21:41.091
Might in magnitude!

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:42.635
[F ADMIN B]
But if we make them too big,

00:21:42.676 --> 00:21:45.221
all they'll defeat is our
processing capability.

00:21:45.262 --> 00:21:47.181
[ADMIN C] Boy, could I
use some extra hands.

00:21:47.223 --> 00:21:48.766
[F ADMIN B] What good do
you think hands are gonna do

00:21:48.808 --> 00:21:51.644
when Maple's waving
literal tentacles around?

00:21:51.685 --> 00:21:54.188
[ADMIN B] For those tentacles to
appear at all was rare enough,

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.232
but then for Maple
to end up with them?

00:21:56.273 --> 00:21:57.817
[ADMIN A] You can't design
a monster's mouth

00:21:57.858 --> 00:21:59.401
without accounting
for the possibility

00:21:59.443 --> 00:22:01.195
of Maple jumping into it!

00:22:01.237 --> 00:22:03.531
[SECRETARY] I must say,
seeing a monster explode

00:22:03.572 --> 00:22:05.658
from the inside was
a new one for me.

00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:06.992
Let alone seeing one eaten.

00:22:07.034 --> 00:22:08.702
[ADMINS]
Seriously.

00:22:08.744 --> 00:22:10.996
[ADMIN A] Let's give the
next event all we've got.

00:22:11.038 --> 00:22:12.373
[ADMIN C]
Yeah, you said it!
