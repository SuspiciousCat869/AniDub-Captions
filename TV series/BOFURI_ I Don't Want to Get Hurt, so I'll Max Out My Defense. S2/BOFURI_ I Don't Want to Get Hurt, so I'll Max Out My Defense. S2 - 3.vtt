00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.386
[GHOSTS giggling]

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:13.138
[KAEDE]
Slow down!

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.057
[GHOST B]
Come on, this way!

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:16.266
[GHOSTS giggling]

00:00:16.308 --> 00:00:18.310
[KAEDE]
Aw, man.

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:22.272
It's times like this when being
slow really is a huge pain.

00:00:22.314 --> 00:00:25.734
And in a tight space like
this, I can't call Syrup.

00:00:25.776 --> 00:00:30.948
[GHOSTS giggling]

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.199
[KAEDE]
I don't see what's so--

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:34.743
[KAEDE yelling]

00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:37.079
[GHOSTS giggling]

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.248
[KAEDE]
What is this? A slime?

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:40.624
Think you can get out of there?

00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.334
We have something
special for you,

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:43.835
but you'll have
to catch us first!

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:47.381
[laughing]

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:49.800
Of course! Psychokinesis!

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:56.765
Ah-ha! Not bad, eh?

00:00:56.807 --> 00:00:59.017
Psychokinesis lets me
move any objects I want

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.812
with my mind,
including monsters!

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:03.105
Venom Capsule!

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:07.859
Followed by--

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.861
[GHOSTS]
What's going on?!

00:01:10.988 --> 00:01:13.615
That should make it
a little harder to move.

00:01:13.657 --> 00:01:15.659
And now for the finishing touch.

00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:17.077
Mr. Slime!

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.247
[KAEDE] Okay, that
should just about do it.

00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:22.833
You're freezing up.

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:25.127
Is something wrong?

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:28.839
[GHOST A]
Oh, no, we've been caught.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.674
[GHOST B]
We sure have been caught.

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:35.262
[GHOSTS]
Let's play again sometime!

00:01:35.304 --> 00:01:36.179
[KAEDE]
Huh?

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:39.016
Not really sure what
that was all about.

00:01:39.057 --> 00:01:39.891
All right!

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.019
These must be what
Sally was looking for!

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.521
Wait, what's this last one?

00:01:44.563 --> 00:01:46.732
"Acquired Ghost Girl's Clothes"?

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.027
[ADMIN A]
Maple strikes again!

00:01:50.068 --> 00:01:52.195
Her unpredictable play
style has triggered a bug

00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:53.405
in the game!

00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:56.908
[F ADMIN B] Ugh! I can't believe
they actually froze up.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.244
[ADMIN B] My guess would be
the combination of the poison,

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:01.455
the slime, and the items
surpassed the game's

00:02:01.496 --> 00:02:02.998
object limit.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.375
[ADMIN C] What possessed you
to put a slime at the bottom

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:07.336
of a pitfall in the first place?

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:09.338
[F ADMIN B]
I thought it was a good idea.

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.465
Hindsight's 20-20, you know!

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:13.133
[SECRETARY]
We can discuss it later.

00:02:13.175 --> 00:02:16.011
Right now, we should focus
on getting that bug fixed.

00:02:16.053 --> 00:02:17.679
[ADMIN A]
Oh, yeah. You're right.

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:19.431
Very good point.

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:21.642
[F ADMIN B] I feel pretty safe
in saying no other player's

00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:23.560
ever gonna do that again.

00:02:23.602 --> 00:02:25.103
[SECRETARY]
A bug is a bug.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:26.980
It must be eliminated.

00:02:27.022 --> 00:02:28.273
[ADMIN A]
You heard her, everyone!

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:30.484
Start working on
a fix right away!

00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:31.652
[ADMINS]
Right!

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:33.737
[ADMIN A]
Ugh. My tummy hurts.

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:16.882
Hey! Sorry for calling
you here so suddenly.

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:19.468
It's fine, but what's
that you've got on?

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.304
Oh, this outfit comes with
a skill called Poltergeist.

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:24.097
It allows you to move
up to ten objects

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.557
at the same time!

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:27.809
I was trying to get
those items you wanted

00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:29.436
and ended up with this, too.

00:04:29.478 --> 00:04:31.396
Wait, those items I wanted?

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:32.647
You heard me!

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:35.442
Here.

00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:36.735
What? You mean you--

00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:38.487
I went back in there
and got them!

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:40.989
I know how uncomfortable
Level Six makes you.

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:42.199
It was no big deal.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.618
No way!
You're the best, Maple!

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:46.036
I'm gonna go try 'em out!

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:53.084
Thanks so much, but-- it turns
out I can't use this one.

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:54.544
Huh? Why not?

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:56.004
Try it for yourself
in the field.

00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:58.089
Well, I'm gonna head out and
look for someplace to grind.

00:04:58.131 --> 00:04:59.174
See ya!

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:07.015
Is it especially difficult
to use or something?

00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:08.433
Hands of Salvation!

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:11.478
Gah! I see.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.939
Yeah, I don't think this
is for Sally after all.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.440
Oh, well.

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:17.150
Oh, it's Mii.

00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:22.614
Sorry 'bout that!
Been here long?

00:05:22.656 --> 00:05:23.949
[MII]
No, it's fine.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.326
I should apologize
for the short notice.

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:29.037
[KAEDE] Please don't!
I didn't have any plans anyway.

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:30.330
Well, thanks!

00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:32.415
So, anyway, what do you think?

00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:33.667
Can you help me?

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:34.668
Sure!

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:36.586
I mean, I told you
I would, didn't I?

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:40.507
[KAEDE]
A graveyard, huh?

00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:42.676
[MII] There should be
some hitodama nearby.

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:44.469
Those who defeat them
are rewarded with

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:45.971
a flame-strengthening skill.

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:47.514
But they're supposed
to be pretty strong,

00:05:47.556 --> 00:05:49.558
and they use AoE attacks.

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.810
You just let me
worry about that!

00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:54.604
Loving Sacrifice!
Throne of the Heavenly King!

00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:01.403
This will keep both of us safe!

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:03.989
Oh, but I can't move
while I'm using this skill,

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.365
so stay close.

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:08.159
Uh-- Yeah. Right. I got it.

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:10.453
[FLAME MONSTERS growl]

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.457
[FLAME MONSTER laughs]

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:15.500
Flame!

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:18.712
[FLAME MONSTERS shriek]

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:19.713
Whoa!

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:22.799
Even your Flame isn't
enough to beat them?

00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:24.676
If only I had more firepower.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:33.393
[FLAME MONSTERS laugh]

00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:34.477
You're fine!

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:36.146
You shouldn't take any damage--

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:38.189
not as long as
I'm on this throne.

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:39.232
Perfect!

00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:41.276
I'll take my time and
do my incantation.

00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:48.241
O crimson glow that doth
banish the blackest darkness.

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:51.036
Vein of burning heat
coursing betwixt destruction

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:52.370
and chaos.

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:54.414
I summon thy power
to this place,

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:57.876
in accordance with
the eternal contract.

00:06:57.918 --> 00:07:00.503
Let thy violent breath that
spilleth forth from fractures

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:03.840
in the world cause
the earth to tremble,

00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:07.636
fill the heavens, and eradicate
all enemies before me!

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:09.596
Volcano Explosion!

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:21.775
Oh, wow! Look at that!

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:26.446
That was incredible!

00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:28.156
I should have known you'd
have an awesome skill

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:29.658
like that at your disposal!

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:31.701
[MII chuckles]
Thank you.

00:07:31.743 --> 00:07:33.620
You know, as long
as we're together,

00:07:33.662 --> 00:07:35.038
we could hit up a cafÃ©.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.624
I have a really
good one in mind!

00:07:37.666 --> 00:07:39.459
I'm beginning to think
you know more about stuff

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:41.795
like this than you do
about the battlefield.

00:07:41.836 --> 00:07:43.463
[KAEDE laughs]
Could be!

00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:50.804
[MII]
What's Sally got going on today?

00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:52.681
I'm afraid the
atmosphere on Level Six

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:55.058
is a bit more than
Sally can handle,

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.936
so she's spending the whole
day on Level Five grinding.

00:07:57.978 --> 00:07:59.688
That surprises me.

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:02.273
What I mean is, Sally seems
like the kind of person

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:03.692
who can handle anything.

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:06.987
The worst part is not being
able to play together as much.

00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:08.655
And that's why we've
already promised to pair up

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:10.198
in the next event.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.741
You two have some friendship.

00:08:11.783 --> 00:08:12.909
I'm jealous.

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:13.868
It's true.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.329
And we are the exact
same way in real life.

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:20.166
Do you ever go exploring
with the other members

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:21.543
of your guild?

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:23.753
[MII]
Hmm. Sometimes, yeah.

00:08:23.795 --> 00:08:26.506
But I feel way more at
ease when I'm with you.

00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:30.093
Oh, 'cause with them you
have to play the leader.

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:32.387
If I'd known this is
how it was gonna be,

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:36.182
I would've created a different
character entirely. Ugh.

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:38.518
[KAEDE] Aw, sounds
like it's a little rough.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.061
It's a lot rough!

00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:41.813
How could I have been
stupid enough to do this

00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:42.981
to myself?

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:45.191
I got some cool skills,
and then right away,

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:47.610
I let it go to my head.

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:50.238
Look, whenever you feel the
need to get away from it all,

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.282
just know I'm always
here for you!

00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:53.616
[MII]
Thanks, that helps.

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:55.285
[door opens]

00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:57.120
Oh, it's Maple and Mii.

00:08:57.162 --> 00:08:58.705
Hey there!

00:08:58.747 --> 00:09:01.207
[KASUMI] You two are
certainly an unusual pairing.

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:02.333
Uh... right.

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:05.170
Well, you two are a pretty
unusual pairing yourselves!

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:07.672
I visited your guild 'cause
I wanted to challenge Sally

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:09.340
to a duel, but

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:11.092
I had totally forgotten
about her whole thing

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:12.469
with ghosts.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.346
And so, it fell to me to
duel her in Sally's stead.

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:17.932
As it turns out,
I defeated her quite handily.

00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:23.021
[KAEDE] And that was when Mii
razed everything to the ground!

00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:25.523
Her fire was so beautiful, too!

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:27.650
[MII]
I owe it all to my training.

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:29.903
That, and the increasingly
powerful magic and skills

00:09:29.944 --> 00:09:30.945
I've gained.

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:32.113
Oh, really?

00:09:32.155 --> 00:09:33.698
Hey, good for you!

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.576
I gotta get even someday
with you, Maple.

00:09:36.618 --> 00:09:39.412
You clobbered me during
that one event, remember?

00:09:39.454 --> 00:09:41.372
Well, I won't go down easy!

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:43.374
I've been working hard, too!

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:45.543
I know someone else
who's been improving.

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:46.419
It's Payne.

00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:47.962
I was under the impression
you were referring

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:49.255
to yourself.

00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:52.342
I wish I had room to brag,
but I keep losing to Sally,

00:09:52.383 --> 00:09:55.053
no matter how many
times I face her.

00:09:55.095 --> 00:09:57.430
I'm sorry, but if you
can't even defeat me,

00:09:57.472 --> 00:09:59.724
you'll never beat
Sally or Maple.

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:02.936
We will beat you in the
next guild competition.

00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:05.188
That's the plan, isn't it, Mii?

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.314
Indeed.

00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:09.025
It's my job to lead the
Flame Emperors to victory

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:11.569
and crush anyone
standing in our way.

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.029
Bring it on, then!

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:16.866
Oh, but could you do me a favor
and not use piercing attacks?

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:19.285
But those are our only
chance of winning.

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:21.496
[GROUP laughs]

00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:23.748
I've been looking for
a tame monster, too.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:27.502
One I can keep as a companion,
like that turtle you have.

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:29.462
I thought there might be a
ghostly one somewhere

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:31.464
in Level Six,
but no luck so far.

00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:32.340
Oh, no.

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:34.425
If you find one, you're not
gonna use it against Sally,

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:35.635
are you?

00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:37.178
Uh oh. Busted.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.721
If you do, I'll take
a bite out of you

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:40.390
in the next guild competition!

00:10:40.431 --> 00:10:41.933
[biting]

00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:43.143
[chuckles]

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:46.062
That seems like something
I'm gonna want to avoid.

00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:49.023
Anyway, think I'll
be heading out now.

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:50.942
How about you, Kasumi?

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:51.860
Me, too.

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:54.737
I was just thinking it's about
time for me to log off.

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:56.573
Maple. Mii. Good day.

00:10:56.614 --> 00:10:57.699
--[MII] Mm.
--[FREDERICA] See ya.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:58.867
Bye bye!

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:04.956
[MII sighs]
That was a close one!

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:08.001
My guard was down,
and there they were!

00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:09.252
I'm sorry.

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:10.837
Next time, we'll have
to get our tea at a place

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:13.423
where we're less likely
to run into our friends.

00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:15.091
Yeah, that's a good idea.

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:16.176
[KAEDE giggles]

00:11:19.554 --> 00:11:20.805
Rawr, rawr!

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:23.933
Hello and thank you all
for being here today!

00:11:23.975 --> 00:11:26.311
I hope you're all ready,
because the seventh event

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:28.188
is about to begin!

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:30.315
Each of the playing fields
offers a different level

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:32.859
of difficulty, so you can
choose the challenge

00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:34.360
that's right for you.

00:11:34.402 --> 00:11:37.488
Additionally, each party will
have their very own map,

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.949
so you'll be fighting the
monsters, not each other.

00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:42.619
You can let loose to
your heart's content!

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.246
The event will last five days,
during which time

00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:47.665
you're free to log on
and off as you wish.

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:49.876
Upon completion,
medals will be awarded

00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:51.586
based on difficulty level.

00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:52.962
Without further ado...

00:11:53.004 --> 00:11:55.757
It's been a long time since
we last saw you, Sally.

00:11:55.798 --> 00:11:58.885
I'm so excited to have Sally
all to myself this time!

00:11:58.927 --> 00:12:01.262
Finally, we're a duo again!

00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:03.848
We're going for the highest
difficulty level, right?

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.768
Oh, yeah. I'm so excited!

00:12:06.809 --> 00:12:10.271
[DORAZOU]
Zero! Let the games begin!

00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:24.744
So, do we work our
way up to the top?

00:12:24.786 --> 00:12:27.080
[RISA] Looks like it
has ten floors total,

00:12:27.121 --> 00:12:29.040
though it's possible we'll get
transported somewhere else

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:30.416
at some point.

00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:32.835
Oh! I can't wait to conquer it!

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:34.754
[RISA]
Right. Let's get moving!

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:46.266
[RISA] First floor looks like
a regular dungeon.

00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:48.601
We should try not
to bump into anything.

00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:51.020
[KAEDE]
Okay. Loving Sacrifice!

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:52.522
Followed by Wooly!

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:02.448
Uh, this is kind of a strange
way to explore a dungeon.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:05.201
This way, we get a solid
boost to our defense,

00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:06.911
and we avoid any pitfalls.

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:08.204
It's a win-win!

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:11.332
Maple! Those monsters!

00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:12.709
Deploy Armament!

00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:17.422
Got 'em!

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:18.631
That's true, you did.

00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:20.675
And you should
see yourself right now.

00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:29.434
--Sally.
--Yeah. It's coming from below.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.853
Wool Hunting!

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:38.318
[RISA] Maple, is your
Deploy Armaments--

00:13:38.359 --> 00:13:42.071
Huh? Yeah! It's Machine God V2!

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:44.741
Apparently, the deal is it'll
change form however I want,

00:13:44.782 --> 00:13:46.034
or whatever.

00:13:46.075 --> 00:13:48.411
Well, I guess I
shouldn't be surprised.

00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:56.127
[DRAGON A growls]

00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:57.503
Maple, back me up!

00:13:57.545 --> 00:13:58.713
[KAEDE]
Commence Attack!

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:02.717
[RISA]
Super Speed!

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:04.135
I'm sorry!

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:05.762
Don't worry about it!

00:14:05.803 --> 00:14:07.055
[DRAGON A growls]

00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:08.348
[KAEDE]
Cover Move!

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:14.270
[KAEDE]
It's charging up!

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:15.855
[RISA gasps]

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:16.981
[KAEDE]
Pierce Guard!

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:19.317
[KAEDE, RISA yell]

00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:23.363
Maple, attack inside its mouth!

00:14:23.404 --> 00:14:24.280
What?

00:14:24.322 --> 00:14:25.406
Its breath.

00:14:25.448 --> 00:14:27.492
That's probably trying to
protect it's weakness,

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:29.077
so aim for the inside.

00:14:29.118 --> 00:14:30.745
Good point. Okay!

00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:36.834
[KAEDE yells]

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:40.630
Maple!

00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:41.964
Commence Attack!

00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:49.472
All right! First floor clear!

00:14:49.514 --> 00:14:51.432
[F ADMIN B]
She cleared the first floor!

00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:53.851
[ADMIN A] Wasn't that dragon's
defining feature supposed to be

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:55.603
its high defense stat?

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:58.356
[ADMIN B] That was the
basis of its design, yes.

00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:00.608
But to keep it from
being totally unbeatable,

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.735
we gave it a weak
spot inside its mouth

00:15:02.777 --> 00:15:04.737
and provided players with
an opening to attack

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:06.072
when it uses its breath.

00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:10.118
[ADMIN C] But we still gave it a
pretty substantial amount of HP.

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:11.327
[F ADMIN A]
Who'd have thought.

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:13.996
Really, to go and jump
directly into its mouth?

00:15:14.038 --> 00:15:16.582
[SECRETARY] Maple does this
sort of thing all the time.

00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:18.918
--This was quite foreseeable.
--[ADMIN B] Ugh.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.254
[F ADMIN B] Let's not lose
our heads just yet!

00:15:21.295 --> 00:15:23.339
This was only the
first floor, after all!

00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:24.715
[ADMIN C]
You're absolutely right!

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:26.759
The first floor's always
the easiest to get past.

00:15:26.801 --> 00:15:28.511
That's just how
these things work!

00:15:28.553 --> 00:15:29.595
[F ADMIN A]
Yeah!

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:32.056
The second-floor monster's
even tougher than the dragon.

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:33.933
And Maple in particular
should have a pretty rough

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:35.101
time with it.

00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:36.060
[ADMIN A]
Good point!

00:15:36.102 --> 00:15:37.895
That Maple's really got
her work cut out for her

00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:39.021
this time!

00:15:39.063 --> 00:15:40.106
[SECRETARY]
Very well.

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:41.315
Let's watch.

00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:48.322
[KAEDE]
So, this floor's a library.

00:15:53.077 --> 00:15:54.829
[RISA]
Are you wearing glasses?

00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:56.789
I found them at
the shop earlier.

00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:58.332
You think they make
me look smart?

00:15:58.374 --> 00:16:00.668
I mean, I did right up
until you asked me that.

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:04.380
Something's here!

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:05.423
Okay!

00:16:15.266 --> 00:16:16.851
Commence Attack!

00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:27.653
What? Hey!

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:28.696
[RISA]
Maple!

00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:33.493
Machine God!

00:16:33.534 --> 00:16:35.453
You mean it stole your skill?

00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:38.247
[KAEDE grunts]

00:16:38.289 --> 00:16:39.373

[KAEDE grunts, yells]

00:16:51.802 --> 00:16:54.555
[RISA] Maple, did it
take any other skills?

00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:55.848
[KAEDE]
Seeping Chaos.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.433
Throne of the Heavenly King.

00:16:57.475 --> 00:17:00.478
Pandemonium. Predator. Atrocity.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.897
Just about all of
my skills are gone!

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:05.650
The only ones I have left
are Provocation and--

00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:08.569
So, we're basically fighting
a pseudo-Maple?

00:17:09.403 --> 00:17:12.281
Tell me, what's
your current vitality?

00:17:12.323 --> 00:17:14.575
Two thousand-ish?

00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:16.202
Two thousand?

00:17:16.244 --> 00:17:17.703
Uh...

00:17:17.745 --> 00:17:19.497
Then you should be able
to withstand its attacks

00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:20.915
for a while.

00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:23.459
And my ice pillars
are indestructible.

00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:26.504
So, stay here and try to take
out half the targets, 'kay?

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:27.588
[KAEDE]
Got it!

00:17:38.182 --> 00:17:39.475
Provocation!

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:44.605
A Step Toward the Underworld!

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:49.694
Fireball!

00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:56.242
Loving Sacrifice!

00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:57.618
Just as I hoped!

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.453
Take this! Fireball!

00:17:59.495 --> 00:18:00.538
[KAEDE]
That's right!

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.790
Loving Sacrifice is a skill
that absorbs damage

00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:04.208
directed at allies!

00:18:06.168 --> 00:18:07.461
[RISA]
Double Slash!

00:18:15.386 --> 00:18:16.387
Ha!

00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:24.854
[RISA]
More targets!

00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:26.272
Thank you kindly!

00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:28.399
[KAEDE]
Provocation!

00:18:46.208 --> 00:18:47.960
--[KAEDE yells]
--[RISA] Maple!

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:53.007
[KAEDE grunts] It's fine!
I didn't take any damage!

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:55.134
Heh... Whoa!

00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:56.844
Wow.

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:59.847
Even fleshed out
the insides, huh?

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:02.391
[RISA]
Maple! Hang tight for a sec!

00:19:02.433 --> 00:19:04.143
I've almost got this!

00:19:12.443 --> 00:19:14.528
[RISA]
May as well try it.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.155
Okay, what do I do?

00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:18.324
Guess I could eat it
like I usually do.

00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:19.784
Though, it is paper.

00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:32.797
Man. I'm worn out.

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:37.468
[RISA] But hey, I got
to test some things.

00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:44.892
[KAEDE]
Sally! You beat it already?

00:19:44.934 --> 00:19:47.061
And so fast! Wow!

00:19:47.103 --> 00:19:48.437
Well, you know.

00:19:48.479 --> 00:19:49.855
These shoes you gave
me turned out to be

00:19:49.897 --> 00:19:51.816
a big help after all.

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:54.360
Anyway, did you get
your skills back?

00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:57.113
Yeah, it looks like everything's
back to the way it was!

00:19:57.154 --> 00:19:59.323
Hi, guys!
Good to have you back!

00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:00.741
Great.

00:20:00.783 --> 00:20:02.410
[SECRETARY]
They made it through again.

00:20:02.451 --> 00:20:03.744
[ADMIN C]
Uh, yeah.

00:20:03.786 --> 00:20:06.330
[F ADMIN A] But did you see how
much Maple was struggling there?

00:20:06.372 --> 00:20:07.206
[ADMIN A]
Sure enough.

00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:09.709
She really did have
trouble with it, huh?

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:10.668
[SECRETARY]
Yes.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:12.962
Too bad the same
can't be said for Sally.

00:20:13.003 --> 00:20:14.296
[ALL groan]

00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:15.548
[ADMIN A]
Let's keep watching!

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.682
[KAEDE] The third floor's
got a whole different

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:26.267
environment, too.

00:20:26.308 --> 00:20:27.893
[RISA] Are we gonna get
jumped by a boss right off

00:20:27.935 --> 00:20:30.146
the bat again?

00:20:30.187 --> 00:20:31.689
[KAEDE yelps]

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:35.276
Apparently, the ground here
deals fixed damage.

00:20:35.317 --> 00:20:37.653
It might not be a problem for
you with your high defense,

00:20:37.695 --> 00:20:39.238
but I should watch out.

00:20:44.618 --> 00:20:47.830
[GOLEM A growls]

00:20:47.872 --> 00:20:49.415
That thing looks super strong!

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:53.377
Ice Pillar!

00:20:55.963 --> 00:20:57.173
Web User!

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.303
A Step Toward the Underworld!

00:21:02.344 --> 00:21:03.554
Ancient Sea!

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:06.891
And Water Ball!

00:21:11.395 --> 00:21:13.439
--No luck?
--Okay. Go, Syrup!

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:14.690
Spirit Cannon!

00:21:14.732 --> 00:21:18.068
[SYRUP]
Turtle!

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.529
[RISA] This looks like
it might just work!

00:21:20.571 --> 00:21:22.531
[KAEDE]
Huh? Wait. What the heck?

00:21:22.573 --> 00:21:23.908
[RISA]
It's changing forms?

00:21:25.159 --> 00:21:27.203
What's this?
It doesn't feel cold, but--

00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:29.205
It's probably a status effect.

00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:30.998
We better end this quickly!

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.125
[GOLEM A growls]

00:21:33.167 --> 00:21:35.294
Fine! Atrocity!

00:21:35.336 --> 00:21:37.546
[KAEDE growls]

00:21:37.588 --> 00:21:38.547
[GOLEM A growls]

00:21:38.589 --> 00:21:39.840
[KAEDE growls]

00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:51.936
So weak!

00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:54.980
[ADMIN A yells]

00:21:55.022 --> 00:21:56.774
[ADMIN B]
Another failure!

00:21:56.816 --> 00:21:59.819
[SECRETARY] No, I believe this
was quite troublesome for them.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.445
[ADMIN A]
Huh? Are you serious?

00:22:01.487 --> 00:22:02.780
[ADMIN C]
How do you figure?

00:22:02.822 --> 00:22:06.325
[SECRETARY] Because, this time,
Maple finally took damage.

00:22:06.367 --> 00:22:07.743
Terrain damage.

00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:14.708
[ADMINS]
Terrain damage?
