WEBVTT

00:00:09.274 --> 00:00:10.776
What?!

00:00:10.776 --> 00:00:15.239
Is that true, Risa? Did they
really release Level 4?

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:18.408
<i>It's true. I just found out
myself, and I can't believe it!</i>

00:00:18.408 --> 00:00:20.911
<i>I thought it wouldn't
happen until next week.</i>

00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:24.122
A lot of players have
already gotten to Level 4.

00:00:24.122 --> 00:00:27.209
So I guess you hadn't noticed either, huh?

00:00:27.209 --> 00:00:29.378
<i>Oh, man, I can't wait!</i>

00:00:29.378 --> 00:00:31.213
<i>I'm gonna log in right now!</i>

00:00:31.213 --> 00:00:35.717
<i>I'll be right there, too. Let's get the
gang together and beat the Level 3 boss!</i>

00:00:35.717 --> 00:00:54.778
Yeah!

00:00:54.778 --> 00:02:26.787
BOFURI: I DON'T WANT TO GET HURT,
SO I'LL MAX OUT MY DEFENSE.

00:02:26.787 --> 00:02:28.997
MAXING DEFENSE AND CHRISTMAS.
- So if we beat this guy,
we can go to Level 4?

00:02:28.997 --> 00:02:30.791
MAXING DEFENSE AND CHRISTMAS.
- Looks tougher than I was expecting.

00:02:30.791 --> 00:02:38.840
MAXING DEFENSE AND CHRISTMAS.
- You can leave this one to me!

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.553
[Phantom World]!

00:02:43.553 --> 00:02:56.400
Here we go!

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.278
I don't... think we're gonna
get a taste of this action.

00:03:00.278 --> 00:03:04.074
I mean, I figured this is
how it was gonna go, but...

00:03:04.074 --> 00:03:24.469
You're amazing, Maple!

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:27.139
What a pretty place!

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.726
What should we do now?
Stop by the guild house first?

00:03:30.726 --> 00:03:32.644
Maybe we should scout out the place?

00:03:32.644 --> 00:03:35.605
I can't wait to see what Level 4's like!

00:03:35.605 --> 00:03:37.107
Same here!

00:03:37.107 --> 00:03:38.692
Sounds good to me.

00:03:38.692 --> 00:03:41.570
I guess gathering information
is our first priority.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.030
Let's split up and look around, then.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.533
We'll meet back up later
and share what we learned.

00:03:46.533 --> 00:03:48.034
Got it!

00:03:48.034 --> 00:03:51.371
All right! Let's do this, everyone!

00:03:51.371 --> 00:04:38.251
Yeah!

00:04:38.251 --> 00:04:41.087
Well, it's probably about time
for some monsters to show up...

00:04:41.087 --> 00:04:43.548
Whoa!

00:04:43.548 --> 00:04:45.008
Frederica?

00:04:45.008 --> 00:04:50.680
You know surprise attacks don't
actually work, don't you?

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.101
I knew you'd be able to
dodge it if anyone could.

00:04:54.101 --> 00:04:56.436
That was just my way of saying hello.

00:04:56.436 --> 00:04:59.064
You're challenging me to another duel?

00:04:59.064 --> 00:05:02.359
Didn't you guys just now
get to Level 4, too?

00:05:02.359 --> 00:05:05.237
Aw, don't be so cold.

00:05:05.237 --> 00:05:08.240
I thought up all kinds
of strategies for this.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.742
Isn't that what you say every time?

00:05:10.742 --> 00:05:15.789
Well, I <i>have</i> to when you crush all
my new strategies right off the bat.

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:17.082
Just one hit!

00:05:17.082 --> 00:05:24.548
If I could land just one hit, I could
give you your first taste of humiliation!

00:05:24.548 --> 00:05:28.593
Well, I haven't died once yet,
and neither has Maple.

00:05:28.593 --> 00:05:31.263
Okay, then... wanna get to it?

00:05:31.263 --> 00:05:35.892
Let's go!

00:05:35.892 --> 00:05:40.230
Oh, so it's always nighttime in Level 4?

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.317
That's so strange.

00:05:44.317 --> 00:05:46.403
Huh?

00:05:46.403 --> 00:05:51.032
It's Mii.

00:05:51.032 --> 00:05:52.284
Okay.

00:05:52.284 --> 00:05:55.620
Once I've soothed my soul,
I'll rejoin the others.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.746
Huh?

00:05:56.746 --> 00:05:58.748
Was that something I wasn't supposed to see?

00:05:58.748 --> 00:06:01.376
Wh-Wh-What should I do?

00:06:01.376 --> 00:06:04.963
Right! I should be honest
and tell her I saw that!

00:06:04.963 --> 00:06:11.428
FLUFFY FRIENDS ROOM
- And that I won't tell anyone,
so she doesn't need to worry!

00:06:11.428 --> 00:06:14.097
Huh?

00:06:14.097 --> 00:06:17.642
They're soothing my soul...

00:06:17.642 --> 00:06:24.024
Yes, I know. I'll give each of
you some. Just wait your turn.

00:06:24.024 --> 00:06:28.987
That little tongue tickles!

00:06:28.987 --> 00:06:36.411
Huh?!

00:06:36.411 --> 00:06:39.998
Oop!

00:06:39.998 --> 00:06:41.374
They really do soothe the soul!

00:06:41.374 --> 00:06:43.126
They're so cute! So cute!

00:06:43.126 --> 00:06:47.213
I know, right? Aren't they adorable?

00:06:47.213 --> 00:06:52.302
You really surprised me, though.
You always look so cool and tough.

00:06:52.302 --> 00:06:55.013
Well, yeah, when I'm acting as guildmaster.

00:06:55.013 --> 00:06:57.807
But I don't really care
if you know about this.

00:06:57.807 --> 00:07:00.393
It's not easy keeping up
the act all the time.

00:07:00.393 --> 00:07:03.021
Oh, and you can call me "Mii."

00:07:03.021 --> 00:07:04.564
Can I ask you something, then?

00:07:04.564 --> 00:07:07.359
Why do you always keep up that act?

00:07:07.359 --> 00:07:08.902
Well...

00:07:08.902 --> 00:07:12.155
When I first started role playing
with this character,

00:07:12.155 --> 00:07:14.658
everyone seemed to rely on me a lot,

00:07:14.658 --> 00:07:17.160
and eventually it got to the point
where there was just no going back.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.913
I've told Misery about this, kind of,

00:07:19.913 --> 00:07:22.666
but I've been keeping it a secret
from the others in my guild.

00:07:22.666 --> 00:07:24.459
So that's why...

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:27.629
Yeah, that's why.

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:31.091
Got it! I won't tell anyone!

00:07:31.091 --> 00:07:36.054
It'll be our little secret, Mii!

00:07:36.054 --> 00:07:38.556
Yeah! Thanks!

00:07:38.556 --> 00:07:41.267
Would you like to go hunting
together sometime?

00:07:41.267 --> 00:07:44.187
Yeah, I'd love to!

00:07:44.187 --> 00:07:46.147
Mii!

00:07:46.147 --> 00:07:48.316
Mii, we've been looking for you.

00:07:48.316 --> 00:07:50.986
You weren't answering our messages.

00:07:50.986 --> 00:07:53.321
Oh, Maple is with you?

00:07:53.321 --> 00:07:58.326
Y-Yes. We were sharing information
as fellow guildmasters.

00:07:58.326 --> 00:07:59.077
Huh?

00:07:59.077 --> 00:08:01.705
Oh, yeah! Something like that!

00:08:01.705 --> 00:08:03.957
The other guild members are waiting for you.

00:08:03.957 --> 00:08:06.668
They want to hear your strategy
for beating Level 4.

00:08:06.668 --> 00:08:09.796
Mii, please give us your guidance.

00:08:09.796 --> 00:08:11.381
All right.

00:08:11.381 --> 00:08:13.717
See you again soon, Maple.

00:08:13.717 --> 00:08:16.678
If you'll excuse us, Maple.

00:08:16.678 --> 00:08:21.474
O-Of course, Misery and Markus!

00:08:21.474 --> 00:08:24.394
<i>I guess Mii's got it rough, too...</i>

00:08:24.394 --> 00:08:28.106
[Multi-Barrier]!

00:08:28.106 --> 00:08:30.233
Trying to hold me in place
right from the get-go?

00:08:30.233 --> 00:08:31.651
That's not gonna work!

00:08:31.651 --> 00:08:38.992
[Multi-Stonebolt]!

00:08:38.992 --> 00:08:49.919
You're mine now!

00:08:49.919 --> 00:08:53.256
I won!

00:08:53.256 --> 00:08:56.343
Sorry. That celebration's
gonna be short-lived.

00:08:56.343 --> 00:09:02.599
Huh?!

00:09:02.599 --> 00:09:04.893
I lost again!

00:09:04.893 --> 00:09:09.355
Ugh, how?! I <i>know</i> I hit you dead-on!

00:09:09.355 --> 00:09:14.611
I'm not gonna show my
precious cards to a rival.

00:09:14.611 --> 00:09:18.323
I'll beat you next time! Remember that!

00:09:18.323 --> 00:09:20.200
Man, I was so sure I won...

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.618
That was too close.

00:09:21.618 --> 00:09:24.329
I can't afford to let my
guard down around her.

00:09:24.329 --> 00:09:29.459
I'm used to fighting her now, but she's
still a top fighter in a top guild.

00:09:29.459 --> 00:09:33.963
EMPTY SHELL
- A skill that nullifies full-to-zero
damage just once a day...

00:09:33.963 --> 00:09:41.679
It saved my skin back there, but still,
I gotta get better at dodging.

00:09:41.679 --> 00:09:43.973
<i>If I ever do get defeated,</i>

00:09:43.973 --> 00:09:49.979
<i>there's only one person who can do it.</i>

00:09:49.979 --> 00:09:52.857
-ONE WEEK LATER-
- This level's a lot bigger
than I would've expected.

00:09:52.857 --> 00:09:56.569
I haven't even reached the tower
in the center of the town yet.

00:09:56.569 --> 00:09:59.781
There are still some materials I
haven't gotten a hold of, too.

00:09:59.781 --> 00:10:02.492
This one might take some time to conquer.

00:10:02.492 --> 00:10:06.371
Yui and I have been riding
around on rickshaws.

00:10:06.371 --> 00:10:10.708
It costs some money, but it's
quicker and easier than walking.

00:10:10.708 --> 00:10:12.877
We both move so slowly, after all.

00:10:12.877 --> 00:10:16.506
I heard the town will be looking different
soon, since it's almost Christmas.

00:10:16.506 --> 00:10:18.133
There are lots of shops, too.

00:10:18.133 --> 00:10:23.096
Though most of them only
sell interior decor.

00:10:23.096 --> 00:10:25.265
The next event will be starting soon,

00:10:25.265 --> 00:10:27.475
so for now, let's work
hard to raise our levels.

00:10:27.475 --> 00:10:40.864
So we can all have a great Christmas!

00:10:40.864 --> 00:10:47.370
I'm in heaven!

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.582
No! If I keep this up,
I'll never want to leave here!

00:10:50.582 --> 00:10:52.876
That said...

00:10:52.876 --> 00:10:56.671
If I bought all this,
I'd run out of money fast.

00:10:56.671 --> 00:11:00.341
I really need to start earning more.

00:11:00.341 --> 00:11:03.928
I still haven't finished that
last quest I picked up.

00:11:03.928 --> 00:11:12.437
Guess I'll do that.

00:11:12.437 --> 00:11:22.322
[Sixth of Sword - Blaze]!

00:11:22.322 --> 00:11:26.910
Kill before I'm killed!

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:35.710
[Last of Sword - Hazy Moon]!

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:56.689
[First of Sword - Heat Haze]!

00:11:56.689 --> 00:11:59.567
I did it! Finally!

00:11:59.567 --> 00:12:04.405
[STR+30] [BEWITCHED SWORD] [SELF-REPAIR]
- The Self-Devouring Bewitched
Sword, Yukari...

00:12:04.405 --> 00:12:10.453
Let's try you out right away.

00:12:10.453 --> 00:12:13.998
If I recall, this guy has a lot of health.

00:12:13.998 --> 00:12:15.458
I'll take you on!

00:12:15.458 --> 00:12:20.880
Self-Devouring Bewitched Sword, Yukari!

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.551
What?!

00:12:25.551 --> 00:12:29.097
Using this sword makes me look like this?

00:12:29.097 --> 00:12:34.477
I can end that by finishing
this battle quick!

00:12:34.477 --> 00:12:56.040
PURPLE PHANTOM BLADE

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:59.335
A TECHNIQUE THAT DRAWS OUT
THE BEWITCHED SWORD'S TRUE POTENTIAL.
- Nice! Excellent!

00:12:59.335 --> 00:13:04.507
I got some more money, too... Huh?

00:13:04.507 --> 00:13:09.345
Huh?! Wh-What's going on?!

00:13:09.345 --> 00:13:18.021
What?!

00:13:18.021 --> 00:13:19.522
Rawr!

00:13:19.522 --> 00:13:22.317
Thank you all for coming here today!

00:13:22.317 --> 00:13:26.738
It's time to kick off our sixth event!

00:13:26.738 --> 00:13:28.531
As we've already announced,

00:13:28.531 --> 00:13:34.787
rare materials and exclusive Christmas items
are hidden throughout the event field,

00:13:34.787 --> 00:13:36.956
so try your best to find them!

00:13:36.956 --> 00:13:38.916
You'll be teleported to
a random starting point,

00:13:38.916 --> 00:13:41.794
and the event period will
be two in-game days.

00:13:41.794 --> 00:13:46.007
Check out the information distributed
in-game for more details!

00:13:46.007 --> 00:13:48.760
And now, the countdown begins!
- Let's do our best, everyone!

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.346
- Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,
- I guess we'll be going into this separately.

00:13:51.346 --> 00:13:53.973
- Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,
- So maybe no one will see me
looking like a child, at least.

00:13:53.973 --> 00:13:55.933
- four, three, two, one, zero!
-Something wrong, Kasumi?

00:13:55.933 --> 00:13:58.061
- four, three, two, one, zero!
-Er, no, nothing.

00:13:58.061 --> 00:14:03.232
four, three, two, one, zero!

00:14:03.232 --> 00:14:11.240
A jungle?

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.034
[Machine God]!

00:14:13.034 --> 00:14:15.787
[Hydra]!

00:14:15.787 --> 00:14:17.121
[Predator]!

00:14:17.121 --> 00:14:19.332
[Deploy Armaments]!

00:14:19.332 --> 00:14:29.967
[Commence Attack]!

00:14:29.967 --> 00:14:35.556
I guess monsters like these aren't
gonna give any skills or items.

00:14:35.556 --> 00:14:45.233
Sounds like the big boys are showing up!

00:14:45.233 --> 00:14:47.318
Huh? Payne?

00:14:47.318 --> 00:14:49.362
Maple?!

00:14:49.362 --> 00:14:52.657
I started out fighting with [Machine God],

00:14:52.657 --> 00:14:57.412
but since there were so many of them,
I figured this might work better.

00:14:57.412 --> 00:14:59.622
I get that, but...

00:14:59.622 --> 00:15:02.166
Aren't you gonna go back
to your regular form?

00:15:02.166 --> 00:15:06.546
N-Not yet... for... reasons...

00:15:06.546 --> 00:15:09.799
Because then I won't be able to
use it again until tomorrow.

00:15:09.799 --> 00:15:14.554
Well, since we met up, how about
we work together for a while?

00:15:14.554 --> 00:15:16.848
Huh? You and me?

00:15:16.848 --> 00:15:19.267
It'd be more efficient to
work as a pair, right?

00:15:19.267 --> 00:15:22.270
Besides, since you clobbered
me in the fourth event,

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.856
I'd like a chance to study how you fight.

00:15:24.856 --> 00:15:27.859
Oh, please! I'm nowhere near that good!

00:15:27.859 --> 00:15:32.613
I should be doing <i>my</i> best to keep
up with top players like yourself!

00:15:32.613 --> 00:15:35.658
I consider it an honor. We pair up, then?

00:15:35.658 --> 00:15:42.790
Yes, by all means!

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:45.543
What the heck is going on here?!

00:15:45.543 --> 00:15:47.295
This is bad!

00:15:47.295 --> 00:15:51.757
If those two pair up, the monsters we
prepared for this event won't stand a chance!

00:15:51.757 --> 00:15:53.926
I never would've seen this coming!

00:15:53.926 --> 00:15:57.930
Argh! That Maple caught
us by surprise again!

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:01.976
SECRETARY
- If I may, I do believe we need
countermeasures against Maple after all.

00:16:01.976 --> 00:16:05.313
If nothing changes, the game's
balance will be thrown off-kilter.

00:16:05.313 --> 00:16:13.279
Yes, but we can't change the game's
rules or specs just to weaken Maple.

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:18.242
That would wreck the balance
of the game even more.

00:16:18.242 --> 00:16:22.538
I think all we can do is buckle
up and see how things go.

00:16:22.538 --> 00:16:24.207
Y-Yes, yes.

00:16:24.207 --> 00:16:26.375
I see. Very well.

00:16:26.375 --> 00:16:29.128
We will use this event to gather data.

00:16:29.128 --> 00:16:33.299
Uh, right, right.

00:16:33.299 --> 00:16:36.260
Remote work isn't as easy as it seems...

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:47.313
That newbie's kinda scary, huh?

00:16:47.313 --> 00:16:50.107
There's nothing for me to even do...

00:16:50.107 --> 00:16:52.235
But damn, talk about aggressive.

00:16:52.235 --> 00:16:55.404
Yeah, you're right.
They just keep attacking us.

00:16:55.404 --> 00:17:00.368
Actually, the one doing
all the attacking is...

00:17:00.368 --> 00:17:03.746
Maple, stop. I hear something.

00:17:03.746 --> 00:17:05.665
Huh?

00:17:05.665 --> 00:17:06.249
Above us!

00:17:06.249 --> 00:17:10.795
Incoming!

00:17:10.795 --> 00:17:13.714
Oh, gosh, there are so many!

00:17:13.714 --> 00:17:20.846
Looks like it's finally my turn!

00:17:20.846 --> 00:17:23.724
W-Wow...

00:17:23.724 --> 00:17:29.730
I wonder who's faster, him or Sally...

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:31.857
What do you want me to do?

00:17:31.857 --> 00:17:33.359
You can stay there!

00:17:33.359 --> 00:17:35.945
Just stop any monsters
coming at me from below!

00:17:35.945 --> 00:17:46.247
Got it!

00:17:46.247 --> 00:17:53.004
Careful, Maple!

00:17:53.004 --> 00:17:55.965
What is this sticky stuff?! Is it honey?!

00:17:55.965 --> 00:17:58.342
Maple!

00:17:58.342 --> 00:18:00.595
Looks like it causes some
kind of status effect!

00:18:00.595 --> 00:18:03.931
If I get hit with a piercing
attack now, I might be done for!

00:18:03.931 --> 00:18:05.266
You're sharing that openly?

00:18:05.266 --> 00:18:09.562
Okay, I'll take care of the rest!

00:18:09.562 --> 00:18:19.780
[Holy Rain]!

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.366
That's a new skill I just gained.

00:18:22.366 --> 00:18:30.166
I won't keep any secrets, either.

00:18:30.166 --> 00:18:38.341
Looks like the boss is here!

00:18:38.341 --> 00:18:40.843
[Sword of Judgment]!

00:18:40.843 --> 00:18:47.767
[Wind Cutter]!

00:18:47.767 --> 00:18:49.810
Thanks, Oboro!

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:50.227
WEB USER I
USES WEBS. AFTER LEVEL 5, THE WEBS CAN
BE STRETCHED. FIRING RANGE IS FIVE METERS.

00:18:50.227 --> 00:18:53.230
Ooh, I got the [Web User] skill!

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:55.399
Sounds fun!

00:18:55.399 --> 00:18:58.569
What's that?

00:18:58.569 --> 00:19:09.330
Is this one of the event items?

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.582
I guess I'm stuck like this for ten minutes.

00:19:11.582 --> 00:19:14.585
I'd rather avoid using this
skill in front of anyone.

00:19:14.585 --> 00:19:17.797
Huh? Kasumi?

00:19:17.797 --> 00:19:21.050
Shin?!

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:24.136
You never saw this! Understand?!

00:19:24.136 --> 00:19:27.723
K-Kasumi! Your wrap! It's gonna fall off!

00:19:27.723 --> 00:19:34.814
Huh?

00:19:34.814 --> 00:19:37.233
-TWO DAYS LATER-
- The event's almost over.

00:19:37.233 --> 00:19:40.444
And we never got to see Payne.

00:19:40.444 --> 00:19:45.616
Where the hell is he, anyway?

00:19:45.616 --> 00:19:46.575
Maple!

00:19:46.575 --> 00:19:47.493
Payne!

00:19:47.493 --> 00:19:50.121
It's Dread and Drag.

00:19:50.121 --> 00:19:52.331
Good to see you again!

00:19:52.331 --> 00:19:56.043
This is far enough.
Thanks for everything, Maple.

00:19:56.043 --> 00:19:57.378
I should be thanking you!

00:19:57.378 --> 00:20:00.548
And don't forget what we talked about, okay?

00:20:00.548 --> 00:20:02.800
Yeah, of course.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.136
Yo, Payne, what's goin' on?

00:20:05.136 --> 00:20:08.723
What did she mean by "what we talked about"?

00:20:08.723 --> 00:20:10.850
Well, actually...

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.310
Merry Christmas!

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:16.021
Merry Christmas!

00:20:16.021 --> 00:20:17.648
This is what she meant?

00:20:17.648 --> 00:20:19.191
Maple invited us.

00:20:19.191 --> 00:20:23.821
It's a party to celebrate the event's ending,
Christmas, and the New Year.

00:20:23.821 --> 00:20:27.867
We're supposed to be rivals, though...

00:20:27.867 --> 00:20:30.369
Oh, it's fine, Markus.

00:20:30.369 --> 00:20:33.497
Even Mii seems to be
friendly with Maple now.

00:20:33.497 --> 00:20:34.749
Right, Mii?

00:20:34.749 --> 00:20:36.459
Y-Yes.

00:20:36.459 --> 00:20:41.255
Okay, everyone!
Did you bring your gift boxes?

00:20:41.255 --> 00:20:44.800
Yeah, and I haven't looked
inside yet, as you requested.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.510
We haven't, either.

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:49.513
It's the 25th now,
so they should finally open!

00:20:49.513 --> 00:20:54.560
I guess everybody who took
part in the event got one.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.937
If my gift makes me super strong,

00:20:56.937 --> 00:21:00.107
I might be able to beat
you next time, Sally.

00:21:00.107 --> 00:21:01.650
That's what I should say to you.

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:04.403
Okay, let's all open them together!

00:21:04.403 --> 00:21:07.239
Is everybody ready?

00:21:07.239 --> 00:21:11.702
Ready, set... open!

00:21:11.702 --> 00:21:13.913
What is all this?

00:21:13.913 --> 00:21:16.373
<i>These</i> are our Christmas gifts?

00:21:16.373 --> 00:21:20.085
Kasumi, why don't you try using that katana?

00:21:20.085 --> 00:21:22.922
I bet a child's costume would
look great on you, then.

00:21:22.922 --> 00:21:25.466
I told you not to bring that up!

00:21:25.466 --> 00:21:28.052
Is this the admins' idea of a joke?

00:21:28.052 --> 00:21:32.014
It looks like they do function
as weapons and armor, though.

00:21:32.014 --> 00:21:35.434
You're right. They're pretty
high-spec, actually.

00:21:35.434 --> 00:21:40.272
These could be pretty useful...
if you can overlook the seasonal theme.

00:21:40.272 --> 00:21:42.525
Nice! I like this!

00:21:42.525 --> 00:21:45.611
But Maple...

00:21:45.611 --> 00:21:48.781
How come only I got one
that looks like this?!

00:21:48.781 --> 00:21:51.617
I'm pretty sure the boxes'
contents are random.

00:21:51.617 --> 00:21:56.121
So you just happened to
pick up a rare one, Maple.

00:21:56.121 --> 00:21:57.414
Way to go!

00:21:57.414 --> 00:22:00.042
You look great in it, Maple!

00:22:00.042 --> 00:22:03.921
Oh... You think so?

00:22:03.921 --> 00:22:06.131
It's just the kind of thing
we'd expect from you.

00:22:06.131 --> 00:22:08.259
Typical Maple.

00:22:08.259 --> 00:22:10.135
Yep.

00:22:10.135 --> 00:22:13.347
Well, now that we know what our gifts are...

00:22:13.347 --> 00:23:46.273
To many more adventures ahead!

00:23:46.273 --> 00:23:49.773
EVENT #6 THREAD 13 "SEE YOU ALL NEXT YEAR"
GOOD EVENT
GJ!
