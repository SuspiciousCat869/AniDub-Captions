WEBVTT

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:22.147
[MAY, YUI]
Go!

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.400
Sword of Judgment! Ha!

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:28.779
Flame! [grunts]

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:36.620
[KUROMU grunts]
Take that!

00:00:37.955 --> 00:00:39.414
[DRAG yells]

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:43.293
Don't waste time on
individual monsters!

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:45.420
[YUKIMI, TSUKIMI] Bear!
Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear...!

00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:57.516
Do we have to fight these, too?

00:00:57.558 --> 00:00:59.560
No, we can bypass them.

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:00.811
Splendid idea.

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:04.398
[SYRUP]
Turtle!

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.858
[FREDERICA]
What are we gonna do now?

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.570
Just stay airborne until
the event has ended?

00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:11.863
I'm afraid that plan won't work.

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:14.408
[SHIN] A lot of the enemies
can also fly.

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:16.952
[MISERY] They could attack
us at any moment.

00:01:16.994 --> 00:01:19.204
[RISA] True, so we need
to find a place to stop.

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:20.831
We'll solidify our defense.

00:01:23.542 --> 00:01:25.294
Let's hold out here, guys.

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:27.129
Yeah. As long as
we're in this spot,

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.131
we should be able
to handle anything.

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:31.842
That's good. Because I'm sure
those monsters are probably

00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:33.635
already on their way here.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.098
Guys. Looks like the
map's changed again.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.309
[MII]
It's even smaller than before.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.893
And I have another concern.

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:45.063
Once it's nightfall,
new monsters appear.

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:48.108
I just hope we can hold out here
until the end of the event.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.401
It'll be fine!

00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:52.279
I'm sure with all of us
fighting together, we can win!

00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:53.280
Yeah!

00:01:53.322 --> 00:01:54.489
There's no denying it.

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:57.117
Your confidence is
rather inspiring, Maple.

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.410
That's true.

00:01:58.452 --> 00:02:00.871
Plus, there's no sense
in overthinking things.

00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:03.665
We'll just handle whatever
the game throws at us.

00:02:03.707 --> 00:02:06.543
We have to make sure
that we all survive.

00:02:06.585 --> 00:02:09.212
[KAEDE] And if anything
happens, I'll protect us!

00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:10.464
It's all settled then.

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:12.257
Guess I'll go and set up
some items and traps

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:13.759
around the perimeter.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.427
[KUROMU]
Cool. I'll watch your back.

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:17.012
I'll come, as well.

00:02:17.054 --> 00:02:20.015
If any attack, the three
of us can handle them.

00:02:20.057 --> 00:02:23.268
Well, I suppose I can set
some traps on the other side.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.603
I'll go, too.

00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:26.730
No monsters yet, but who knows?

00:02:26.772 --> 00:02:28.649
That's true, they could
launch a surprise attack

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.025
from anywhere.

00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:31.234
I'll accompany you.

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.112
--[IZ] Fay!
--[FAY] Fay!

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:44.706
I guess we finished in time.

00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:45.916
Over there!

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:52.839
Sister, it appears
it's finally begun.

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:56.051
Yes. Stronger monsters
have emerged at last.

00:02:56.093 --> 00:02:57.969
The final boss of the final day.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.930
Wonder what it's gonna be like.

00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:02.349
Do you think we'll be okay, bro?

00:03:02.391 --> 00:03:05.185
Well, ain't no point
in sugar-coating.

00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:07.187
We'll just have to
try and stay alive.

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:08.438
Precisely!

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.440
We shall bloom like
beautiful flowers,

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:11.858
proudly and gallantly!

00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:43.181
Whoa, it's another fake Maple!

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:46.518
Its size doesn't even begin to
compare to the other monsters.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.855
Fifty? No. At least
100 meters tall.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:51.898
[PLAYERS gasp]

00:03:55.277 --> 00:03:57.237
[PLAYER A]
There's no way we can beat that!

00:03:57.279 --> 00:04:00.949
[PLAYER B]
Just run! It's all we can do!

00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:02.409
[PLAYER C]
We don't have to beat it!

00:04:02.451 --> 00:04:04.161
If we can just
stay alive, we win!

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:06.121
[PLAYER D] Yeah, if you want my
opinion, we're better off

00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:09.332
leaving the insane monsters to
the insane monster players!

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:11.668
[PLAYER E] You think they'll
even try to fight that creature?

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.295
[PLAYER A] Dunno! But they're
pretty crazy themselves,

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:14.504
so who knows?

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:22.220
Hey! Up there! Look out!

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.733
--Maple!
--On it!

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:38.069
Aegis!

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:56.213
Thanks a lot, Maple.

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:57.088
Sure.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.008
But I dunno if I can save us if
that keeps happening, though.

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:13.063
[GROUP]
We're going to lose our medals!

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:15.982
We have to help!

00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:19.778
All the other players will
be killed at this rate!

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.905
Uh... You're right.

00:05:21.947 --> 00:05:24.157
This isn't like the
guild competition.

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.368
Helping the other
players won't hurt us.

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.411
It's actually beneficial to us.

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:30.622
The more players
we still have alive,

00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:33.583
the more scattered the monster's
various attacks will be.

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:35.585
If this is what our
guildmaster wants,

00:05:35.627 --> 00:05:37.754
then the rest of us
have no objections.

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:39.005
[GROUP]
Right!

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:41.258
Uh, right.

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:42.884
Well, if that's the case...

00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:44.469
...we'll fight as well.

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:48.098
Remember what I said, boys,
we shall bloom gallantly!

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.183
[KUROMU]
All right, so what's the plan?

00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:52.269
Just help those other
players make a run for it?

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:56.898
Looks like the field
is still shrinking.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.567
And by the time the event ends,

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:01.069
there'll probably be
nowhere left to run.

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:02.612
[KUROMU] Which means we
gotta do something about

00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:04.447
that big boy, huh?

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:07.576
Mmm. Then that's
our primary target.

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:09.411
It's our only choice.

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:12.414
[PAYNE] We need to bring down
the other monster mobs first.

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:15.625
Otherwise, we can't focus
on the bigger one.

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:17.460
Then there's no time to waste.

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:19.754
Flame Emperors, let's get going!

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:21.298
--Yes, ma'am!
--[MISERY] Understood.

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:23.300
[MII]
Ignis! We'll head out first!

00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:25.427
Best of luck, everybody!

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:27.888
Order of the Holy
Sword. Move out!

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:29.556
We'll see you soon, Maple.

00:06:29.598 --> 00:06:30.640
Right!

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:38.315
So, what should
the rest of us do?

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:40.567
We don't have the
speed for a hit-and-run,

00:06:40.609 --> 00:06:42.569
but there is something
we can do.

00:06:42.611 --> 00:06:46.114
It's our job to keep that
big boss in one place.

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:49.326
Right.

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:51.077
In the meantime, the other
guilds will get rid of

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:52.245
the smaller ones.

00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:53.705
It makes sense to me.

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:55.582
Plus, we're all better
suited to boss fights

00:06:55.624 --> 00:06:57.083
than running around.

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.627
[KUROMU]
Yeah, sounds good.

00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:00.295
Beating that thing and
getting all of the glory

00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:02.213
isn't a bad bonus, either.

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:04.799
Well, if just running
away from it won't work,

00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:07.177
we might as well go ahead
and lead an offensive attack,

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:08.053
ya think?

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:09.179
Don't forget us!

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.680
We'll help, too!

00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:12.182
Well, you heard them.

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:14.184
Mm-hmm! 'Kay!

I bet you that glowing spot
is that thing's weakness.

Let's split up and lower its HP.

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:40.854
Our goal is for all of us to
stay alive until the very end.

If things get too hairy,
we fall back.

if I attacked its
wings or something.

Smart idea.

00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:51.854
If we can ground it,

And it was worth three medals.

All the surviving players
get five medals each.

[ADMIN C] We'll have to
tweak the next level before it

00:20:08.624 --> 00:20:10.584
The field design, the
strength of the monsters,

[ADMIN A] Our physical and
mental limits only stretch

00:20:58.215 --> 00:20:59.383

Embrace every bit of overtime
that comes your way!

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:08.642
I'll even negotiate with
the top brass to increase

00:21:08.684 --> 00:21:10.394
your overtime pay!

Really?

00:21:11.562 --> 00:21:14.148
[SECRETARY] I'll ask them to
give you a special bonus, too!

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:16.484
New World Online has
become a massive success,

00:21:16.525 --> 00:21:19.111
and it wouldn't have been
possible without your hard work!

00:21:20.863 --> 00:21:23.908
I'll also ask them to hire
some additional personnel!

00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:25.951
There's a young lady
who works under me

00:21:25.993 --> 00:21:28.245

she wanted to work here!

all a little too excited.

00:21:32.583 --> 00:21:35.795
[SECRETARY] Well, uh, I can't
promise that the top brass

00:21:35.836 --> 00:21:37.505
will actually listen to me.

00:21:38.672 --> 00:21:41.884
[KAEDE] Wow, we got a lot more
medals than we ever expected!

00:21:41.926 --> 00:21:44.345
I wonder what I should
exchange them for this time!

00:21:44.386 --> 00:21:47.431
Personally, I think we should
hold off until Level Eight.

00:21:47.473 --> 00:21:49.475
Once we see what
kind of level it is,

00:21:49.517 --> 00:21:51.060
we can make an
informed decision.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.230
Makes sense!

00:21:54.271 --> 00:21:57.900
In that case, there's something
else I'd like to do with you!

00:21:57.942 --> 00:21:58.943
Huh?

00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:38.566
[KAEDE] Kinda brings back
memories, doesn't it?

00:22:38.607 --> 00:22:40.442
We haven't been back in forever.

00:22:40.484 --> 00:22:43.237
Hey Sally, remember the very
first time we came here?

00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:44.446
[RISA chuckles]

00:22:44.488 --> 00:22:47.116
I'm glad you got so hooked.

00:22:47.157 --> 00:22:49.660
Still, I'm sure even stronger
monsters and guilds

00:22:49.702 --> 00:22:53.330
will be coming along, so we
can't get lazy, Guildmaster.

00:22:53.372 --> 00:22:54.790
Mm-hmm. That's right.

00:22:54.832 --> 00:22:58.252
I'll keep maxing out my defense
since I don't like getting hurt.

00:22:58.294 --> 00:23:00.212
Guess I'll have to
work harder, too.

00:23:00.254 --> 00:23:02.840
Don't want a certain someone
to leave me in the dust.

00:23:02.882 --> 00:23:05.467
What? I would never leave you!

00:23:05.509 --> 00:23:07.344
[RISA]
I dunno, you're pretty famous.

00:23:07.386 --> 00:23:10.639
[VELVET] Look, it's Maple and
Sally from the Maple Tree Guild!

00:23:10.681 --> 00:23:12.641
Did you see how they
rocked the last event?

00:23:12.683 --> 00:23:13.976
They were incredible!

00:23:14.018 --> 00:23:17.396
Yes, but that doesn't mean
they are without weaknesses.

00:23:17.438 --> 00:23:19.523
It's true they're rather strong.

00:23:19.565 --> 00:23:22.484
In the end, they won't
be ready for us.

00:23:22.526 --> 00:23:24.361
Man, I can't wait!

00:23:24.403 --> 00:23:27.281
I'm especially psyched
to take on Sally!

00:23:27.323 --> 00:23:28.240
Hey!

00:23:28.282 --> 00:23:29.617
[RISA laughs]

00:23:29.658 --> 00:23:30.659
I'm kidding!

00:23:30.701 --> 00:23:32.119
They're certainly lively.

00:23:32.161 --> 00:23:33.829
Well, can we beat them?

00:23:33.871 --> 00:23:34.955
Who knows?

00:23:34.997 --> 00:23:37.333
The easiest way
to find out is to try.

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:41.921
But it does seem
like there's a way.
