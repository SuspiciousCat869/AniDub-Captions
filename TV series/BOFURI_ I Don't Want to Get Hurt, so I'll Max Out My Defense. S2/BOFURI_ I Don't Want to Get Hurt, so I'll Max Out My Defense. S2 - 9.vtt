WEBVTT

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:10.469
[DORAZOU]
Rawr!

00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:12.054
Now that the preliminary's over,

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:14.097
it's time to move on
to the main event!

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.183
Listen closely as I walk
you through exactly how

00:00:16.225 --> 00:00:17.684
it's gonna work!

00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:20.479
The event will last for
three in-game days.

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:23.315
For those participating at
the highest difficulty level,

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:25.442
if you manage to stay
alive to the very end,

00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:27.528
you'll receive five
silver medals!

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:28.654
That's us!

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.572
We all worked really hard
to make it to the highest

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:32.991
difficulty level, and
our efforts paid off!

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:36.370
[KUROMU] Uh, you do realize
Dorazou can't hear you, right?

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:38.664
[DORAZOU] Defeating powerful
monsters and seeking out

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:42.125
hidden items are also effective
ways of obtaining medals!

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:43.544
And get this!

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:45.754
Every time you win a medal,
every other member

00:00:45.796 --> 00:00:48.173
of your party will
receive one as well!

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:49.841
So that's how it works.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:50.801
Which means...

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:52.469
...we should think
about splitting up.

00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:54.221
That would be the most
efficient way to collect

00:00:54.263 --> 00:00:55.889
as many medals as possible.

00:00:55.931 --> 00:00:59.142
On the other hand, sticking
together is a lot safer.

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:02.187
[DORAZOU] Also, there are some
especially powerful monsters

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.314
that will be appearing at
certain predetermined times

00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:05.524
throughout the event.

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.317
If you want to know
when they're coming,

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:09.361
be sure to keep
an eye on the timer!

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:12.447
You'll be playing on the same
map from the preliminary.

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:13.782
Yeah, I figured.

00:01:14.992 --> 00:01:18.161
[DORAZOU] And now, it's time
to start the countdown!

00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:19.288
Ten...!

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:20.497
[KAEDE]
What do you think, Sally?

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.457
Should we keep everyone
together or split up

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:24.376
and gather medals individually?

00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:25.377
Not sure.

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:27.838
Let's make that decision
once we get out there.

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:30.465
...One! Zero!

00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:32.718
Off you go, everyone!

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.734
[RISA] Hey! We've got a
nice, clear view, huh?

00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:15.195
Doesn't look like there are any
other players around here.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.034
[KAEDE gasps]

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:22.994
[KUROMU]
Didn't waste any time, did they?

00:03:25.414 --> 00:03:28.208
So, these are to be
our first opponents!

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.502
Loving Sacrifice!

00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:32.796
Fay! Strengthen Item!

00:03:32.838 --> 00:03:33.880
[FAY]
Fay.

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:36.925
Now, Syrup! Spirit Cannon!

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:40.554
[SYRUP]

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:43.265
--Tsukimi!
--Yukimi!

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:44.516
[TSUKIMI, YUKIMI]
Bear!

00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:47.602
[YUI, MAY]
Power Share! Bright Star!

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:49.062
[TSUKIMI, YUKIMI]
Bear! Bear!

00:03:53.692 --> 00:03:55.944
You mean that wasn't
enough to take them down?

00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:57.696
This is the highest difficulty.

00:03:57.738 --> 00:03:59.406
Haku! Super Megamorph!

00:03:59.448 --> 00:04:00.949
Paralysis. Poison!

00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:02.576
Oboro! Binding Barrier!

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:15.756
[KUROMU]
Necro!

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:17.174
Flames of Death!

00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:21.261
[MAY, YUI]
Double Strike, go!

00:04:21.303 --> 00:04:22.345
[TSUKIMI, YUKIMI]
Bear!

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:25.682
So strong!

00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:28.018
We ended up with
some great monsters!

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:30.061
Having your protection makes
it a whole lot easier

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.688
to fight, Maple!

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.315
You know, now that
you mention it,

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:34.775
it was almost too easy.

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:36.902
Like we had more
power than usual.

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:38.236
[YUI]
Yeah, I know what you mean.

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:40.155
[KANADE laughs]

00:04:40.197 --> 00:04:42.157
Sou, get over here!

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.617
It's another me!

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:46.995
I borrowed an insignificant
amount of your attack power

00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:49.498
and the results were
just as expected.

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:50.624
Interesting.

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:52.667
Then your Sou has the
capability to duplicate

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:54.419
our appearances and skills.

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:55.796
How cool!

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:57.714
That'll come in handy for sure!

00:04:57.756 --> 00:05:00.008
[MAY]
So that wasn't a Double Strike.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.385
[YUI] In reality,
it was Triple Strike!

00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:04.179
Not bad, eh?

00:05:04.221 --> 00:05:06.723
The only downside is
that it doesn't last long

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:08.725
and then it takes
forever to cool down.

00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:12.270
Sally? Something wrong?

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.606
Those two didn't
drop any medals.

00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:16.316
Which means but one thing:

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:19.444
there are far stronger monsters
than these waiting for us.

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:23.031
It appears those medals
won't be so easy to come by.

00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:25.242
Now, let's do a quick review.

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:28.703
Our primary goal in this event
is to collect ten medals,

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:31.039
which can ultimately be
exchanged for rare skills

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:32.374
and items.

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:34.793
Surviving to the end
will net us five medals.

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:37.462
Therefore, we're going to need
to find five additional medals

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:40.131
over the course of the event
in order to meet our goal.

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:42.342
Yeah. That sounds right.

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:44.302
[KUROMU] So how do we
want to approach this?

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:46.429
Split up and take our
chances, or stick together

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:48.098
and work as a team?

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.933
[KANADE] For now, how about
we divide ourselves

00:05:49.975 --> 00:05:53.061
into two groups based on whose
skills work best together?

00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:54.312
[IZ]
Sounds good to me.

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:56.147
It'd certainly be safer
than all of us heading out

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:57.774
on our own.

00:05:57.816 --> 00:05:59.943
Those of us with the lowest
defense should probably be

00:05:59.985 --> 00:06:02.028
on Maple's team.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.822
Which means me...

00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:05.699
[KAEDE]
...as well as May and Yui!

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.409
We'd love to come with!

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.536
We'll do our best, right, Sis?

00:06:09.578 --> 00:06:10.579
Very well.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.664
I suppose this means the
four of us will be forming

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:13.874
our own team.

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:15.458
With Sou here on our side,

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.752
we'll have all the
offensive power we need.

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:19.880
[RISA] Fellow party members
are automatically displayed

00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:21.631
on the map, so it
should be pretty easy

00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:24.092
for us to reunite whenever
the really strong monsters

00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:25.552
start showing up.

00:06:25.594 --> 00:06:28.221
[KUROMU] In that case, our group
will head toward the forest.

00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:30.181
Maple, can your group
cover the wetlands?

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:31.349
[KAEDE]
Yeah, definitely!

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:35.896
[KUROMU]
Gotta say, Kasumi.

00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:38.231
Pretty unusual
ride you got here.

00:06:38.273 --> 00:06:39.524
You get used to it.

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:42.319
Moving is a lot faster
this way, too.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.279
Personally, I'm a fan.

00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:46.823
It's cool and I
like how it feels.

00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:49.576
You sure you're okay
carrying all of us, Haku?

00:06:49.618 --> 00:06:50.827
[HAKU]
Sss! Sss!

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:51.953
He's so cute!

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:56.166
[RISA] We won't be competing
against other guilds this time,

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:58.335
so we can focus
on gathering medals.

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:01.087
[KAEDE] But still, we're playing
on such an expansive field.

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:03.131
How do we decide
where to start looking?

00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:06.217
[RISA chuckles]
I was hoping you'd ask me that.

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.345
Take a look at the
map I sent you.

00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:09.554
During the preliminary,

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:11.514
I marked all the suspicious
spots I found in case

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:12.641
we came back here.

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:14.809
I went ahead and sent this
to the other team, too.

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:17.145
Sally, you've done it again!

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:18.188
Let's see.

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:20.190
This right here is
our current position.

00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:22.734
It looks like there's a
marker in the wetlands.

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:23.902
[KAEDE]
Oh, you're right!

00:07:23.944 --> 00:07:26.488
Yep. So why don't we head
over and check it out?

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:28.156
Sounds good!

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:29.366
--Tsukimi!
--Yukimi!

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:30.492
[TSUKIMI, YUKIMI]
Bear!

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:37.290
[KAEDE]
What do you make of this, Sally?

00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:38.959
[RISA] I didn't see any
monsters like this here

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:40.919
during the preliminary.

00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:43.046
But the terrain's still
the same as before.

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:45.966
It does seem like there must
be something hidden there.

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:47.801
What do we do now?

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:50.387
We can't afford any deaths,
so it might be dangerous

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:51.805
to just jump right in.

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:53.348
Aw, don't worry!

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:54.766
At a time like this...

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.771
[RISA] ...you just can't beat
having the ability to fly!

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:00.897
[KAEDE]
All right, Syrup!

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:03.566
Bring us down nice and easy!

00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:04.776
[GROUP yells]

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:11.866
Okay, Syrup. Return!

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.664
We're underground?

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:19.457
Beneath that little
island, I guess.

00:08:21.793 --> 00:08:22.794
Heads up!

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:26.756
[KAEDE]
Loving Sacrifice!

00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:29.342
Elemental attacks
may be the way to go!

00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:30.760
Better use fire!

00:08:30.802 --> 00:08:31.761
Right!

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:33.680
Let's make short
work of him, Sis!

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:36.057
[MAY, YUI]
Double...

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:37.142
...Strike!

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:47.527
With Maple's Loving
Sacrifice guarding us...

00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:50.238
...we don't have to worry
about taking damage!

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.074
[MAY, YUI grunt]

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:55.410
I can't let those two
do all the work!

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:56.828
Fireball!

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:01.124

One more time!

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:10.133
Wow! Good going!

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:12.260
Hold on! Something's wrong!

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:14.345
Huh? What's happening?

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:16.181
[RISA]
May! Yui! Your feet!

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.233
Thanks, you really saved us!

00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:28.985
Hey, Maple, bring out Syrup!

00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:30.236
You two, come with me!

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:39.621
Defeat one and all
it does is multiply.

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:40.997
So now what?

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:42.499
If we go back down
there, they'll attack us

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.750
with those vines.

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:44.834
Leave it to us!

00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:46.586
Yeah, we've been practicing.

00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:49.714
--We can attack them...
--...from a distance!

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:54.886
One, two, and three!

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:00.725
Look at that! A perfect hit!

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:02.894
All that practice paid off!

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:05.021
[RISA]
Oh, that's great!

00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:07.982
I bet you'd do even more damage
if you used your Great Hammers!

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:10.068
Yeah, you'd think
that would be the case.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.362
[YUI] But the iron
balls keep breaking.

00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:13.404
So, yeah.

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:16.032
We did ask Iz about making
us some tougher ones.

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:18.118
[RISA chuckles]
I gotcha.

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:27.168
[KAEDE] Looks like they've got
things under control, huh?

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.796
[RISA] I'm starting to feel
kinda bad for the monsters.

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:37.262
[KAEDE] All right!
We got our first medal!

00:10:40.431 --> 00:10:42.475
[KUROMU] Hey, Maple's
group picked up a medal!

00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:44.352
I figured they'd work fast.

00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:46.187
We may be close ourselves.

00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:49.107
I believe one of the locations
Sally marked is up ahead.

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:51.109
[KANADE]
Look. I bet that's it there.

00:10:52.944 --> 00:10:56.114
[IZ] I'm not seeing anyone
or anything nearby.

00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:57.949
[KUROMU]
Should we try touching it?

00:10:57.991 --> 00:10:59.242
Good idea.

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:00.368
Haku, go.

00:11:09.377 --> 00:11:10.712
Haku, return.

00:11:10.753 --> 00:11:12.046
[KUROMU]
Necro!

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:13.006
Fay!

00:11:13.047 --> 00:11:14.048
Sou!

00:11:17.969 --> 00:11:18.970
[KUROMU]
Cover!

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:25.852
[KUROMU]
You're up, Kanade!

00:11:25.894 --> 00:11:26.936
Sou!

00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:31.941
Thanks, Sou. Well done!

00:11:31.983 --> 00:11:33.276
Allow me to heal you.

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:39.199
[KUROMU] Seems to be
a ninja-type monster.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.076
It's not gonna reveal
itself willingly.

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:44.662
[KASUMI] It's obviously
out there somewhere.

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:45.747
But where?

00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:47.832
[KANADE] I have an idea, but
it won't work with all these

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:49.959
obstacles in the way.

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:52.795
Sit tight.
I'll take care of that for you.

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:55.340
[KUROMU] And how are you
gonna do that, exactly?

00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:06.643
[KUROMU] Okay, these things
look kinda dangerous.

00:12:06.684 --> 00:12:08.144
I'm setting them
off all at once,

00:12:08.186 --> 00:12:11.105
so everybody stay
within the safety zone.

00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:13.399
And get closer together.

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:15.068
Here goes!

00:12:15.109 --> 00:12:17.362
Three, two, one!

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.793
[IZ]
Kanade!

00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:33.127
Thanks for the help!

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:34.629
Now, Searcher's Sun!

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:43.888
[KANADE]
Gotcha!

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:44.847
[KUROMU]
Let's go!

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:47.225
[KASUMI]
Super Speed! Last of Sword!

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:48.643
Hazy Moon!

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:52.897
[KUROMU] Ghost Mud! Necro!
Flames of Death!

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:03.741
[KUROMU] There!
Maple Tree's second medal.

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:05.034
Two on the first day.

00:13:05.076 --> 00:13:07.287
Not too shabby.

00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:10.373
[IZ] Still, it took a bit longer
than I expected.

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:12.959
[KANADE] This might be
a good time to regroup.

00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:14.919
According to this, the strong
monsters are coming out

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:16.254
at night.

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:17.255
[KUROMU]
Right.

00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:18.798
Let's meet up with
Maple and the others.

00:13:26.055 --> 00:13:27.557
[KAEDE]
Oh! Look, there they are!

00:13:27.598 --> 00:13:28.850
Hey!

00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:30.935
Hey, Maple!

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:32.645
Is this the place?

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:35.315
[IZ]
What do you think?

00:13:35.356 --> 00:13:37.692
Wouldn't this make
the perfect base?

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:40.403
[RISA] It has kind of a
dungeon-y feeling, you know?

00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:42.155
Nothing's attacked us, though.

00:13:42.196 --> 00:13:43.114
[KANADE]
Yeah.

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:45.908
Probably a dummy dungeon they
put here to confuse players.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.452
[KASUMI] Or perhaps it was
meant to afford them

00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:48.995
a momentary respite.

00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:52.749
[KUROMU]
Either way, it's nice and big.

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.001
More than enough room
to get comfortable.

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:56.377
True. Good point.

00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:57.378
[KAEDE]
Okay!

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.173
Let's see if we can't get
everything ready by nightfall!

00:14:00.214 --> 00:14:02.133
[IZ] I'll start crafting
some furniture.

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:03.634
That would be great!

00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:06.971
I'm gonna go set some defensive
traps to keep out intruders.

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:09.307
[MAY, YUI]
We can help you out with that!

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:10.808
[KUROMU]
Great! And we'll, uh--

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.769
We'll find something to do.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:15.188
[RISA] I think Kanade has the
right idea about making sure

00:14:15.229 --> 00:14:16.898
the area is well-defended.

00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:18.399
Let's all help out with that.

00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:20.693
[KAEDE]
All right! Let's do this thing!

00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:21.819
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:14:22.737 --> 00:14:27.784
I did my usual big finish, but
what can we really do here?

00:14:27.825 --> 00:14:30.328
I know the goal is to make
sure nobody can get through,

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.997
but when you're dealing
with a space this huge...

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:35.666
I know! Venom Capsule!

00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:43.883
Huh. Is this really
gonna do the trick?

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:45.301
If we do end up
getting attacked,

00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:47.178
the entire room will collapse.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.388
I know!

00:14:56.813 --> 00:14:58.648
Now all I have to do
is make sure poison

00:14:58.689 --> 00:15:01.275
can't come in from
the rear of the cave!

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:02.944
Throne of the Heavenly King!

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:08.324
There! All done!

00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:13.955
Hey! How's everything going?

00:15:13.996 --> 00:15:15.123
[YUI]
Oh, hey, Maple!

00:15:15.164 --> 00:15:16.999
Make sure you watch
where you're going in here!

00:15:17.041 --> 00:15:18.126
[KAEDE]
Huh?

00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:19.460
[yells]

00:15:22.713 --> 00:15:24.424
[MAY, YUI]
Maple, no!

00:15:24.465 --> 00:15:26.551
[KAEDE yells]

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.932
Whoa! That was scary!

00:15:32.974 --> 00:15:35.726
Wait! Oh, no, I ruined the
trap you were working on!

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.228
[MAY]
That's okay!

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:38.312
[YUI]
She's right.

00:15:38.354 --> 00:15:40.565
The important thing is that
you're safe and sound.

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:41.691
[KAEDE]
I'm so sorry.

00:15:41.732 --> 00:15:43.693
I'll help you set
it back up again.

00:15:43.734 --> 00:15:46.404
Gosh. I'm gonna have to be more
careful when I go check out

00:15:46.446 --> 00:15:48.197
the other rooms.

00:15:48.239 --> 00:15:50.324
We made sure to set them up
in a way where we can all

00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:52.743
get past them as long
as we walk carefully.

00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:55.037
So they shouldn't create a
problem when we leave, either.

00:15:57.081 --> 00:15:59.834
[KAEDE] Oh, no! I wasn't
thinking about that at all!

00:15:59.876 --> 00:16:02.462
I just set up a room
nobody can get through!

00:16:02.503 --> 00:16:04.630
I totally screwed up!

00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:07.300
I gotta do it over so we'll
be able to get in and out!

00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:09.969
What sort of room did
you end up making?

00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:12.889
[KAEDE]
I'll show you guys later on.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:14.765
Let's finish up here first.

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:15.808
[MAY, YUI]
Right!

00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:21.689
[KAEDE]
Amazing!

00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:23.232
This looks great, Iz!

00:16:24.692 --> 00:16:26.360
Oh, welcome back.

00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:29.071
Are you guys all done
securing the area?

00:16:29.113 --> 00:16:30.865
[MAY]
Uh-huh! Everything's set!

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:33.534
[YUI] At this point,
we've done all we can do!

00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:35.745
[KAEDE] So, uh, no offense,
but that side over there

00:16:35.786 --> 00:16:37.497
still looks pretty unfinished.

00:16:37.538 --> 00:16:39.582
[IZ] That's in case any
monsters slip through.

00:16:39.624 --> 00:16:41.125
No matter how
good our traps are,

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:43.211
we have to be prepared
for anything, right?

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:46.214
There we go.

00:16:48.132 --> 00:16:49.759
This is really something else.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.512
You must have had to
use a lot of materials.

00:16:52.553 --> 00:16:55.389
[IZ] Eh, not much of anything
too valuable, at least.

00:16:55.431 --> 00:16:57.141
Still, it would be great
if you two could help me

00:16:57.183 --> 00:16:58.601
restock later.

00:16:58.643 --> 00:16:59.560
Sure!

00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:01.270
It would be our pleasure!

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:05.024
[KUROMU] Whoa! Iz went
totally overboard again!

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:06.192
Welcome back.

00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:07.860
Are you guys done, too?

00:17:07.902 --> 00:17:10.154
Yes. We'll need to
exercise great caution

00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:11.822
when leaving this place.

00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:14.242
Yeah, a lot of these traps
will definitely kill you

00:17:14.283 --> 00:17:16.035
if you trip them by accident.

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:18.371
Wait! What if some other
party shows up here

00:17:18.412 --> 00:17:20.122
and wanders in to investigate?

00:17:20.164 --> 00:17:21.207
They'll be wiped out!

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:22.166
Don't worry.

00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:24.335
No one who can read
is coming in here.

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:27.588
Not after they get a look at
the sign we put up outside.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.924
[KAEDE]
What kind of sign?

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:31.717
[RISA]
This kind.

00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:33.970
Well, it's certainly
not inaccurate.

00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:36.305
[KANADE] Matter of fact, I'd
say this is about as dead-on

00:17:36.347 --> 00:17:37.640
as it gets.

00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:40.851
It's true.
This place is full of traps.

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:43.521
You know, part of me feels
like it would be kind of fun

00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:44.605
to test them out.

00:17:50.278 --> 00:17:52.989
[RISA] So, this is the
finished product, huh?

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:54.699
[KUROMU] You know, in the
end, it turned out to be

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.701
more like a fortress
than a base.

00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:58.995
Hey, it's better to
be safe than sorry.

00:17:59.036 --> 00:18:00.621
We have no idea what
kinds of monsters

00:18:00.663 --> 00:18:02.707
are coming after us.

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:04.166
It's just about time.

00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:07.295
The super strong monsters
should be appearing pretty soon.

00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:10.172
[KUROMU] There's a chance one of
them could get past our traps.

00:18:10.214 --> 00:18:11.632
[RISA]
True. Okay, then.

00:18:11.674 --> 00:18:13.092
Let's be ready for them.

00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:21.642
[KAEDE]
I think it's started!

00:18:21.684 --> 00:18:22.602
[RISA]
Yeah.

00:18:22.643 --> 00:18:24.979
We may have to
attack at any time!

00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:26.063
[KAEDE yelps]

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:31.444
[KUROMU]
Is it dead?

00:18:31.485 --> 00:18:32.820
Likely.

00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:34.989
However, we're going to need
to go out and check the traps

00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:37.116
in order to be sure.

00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:39.827
Why don't Maple
and I go take a look?

00:18:39.869 --> 00:18:42.747
If it turns out the monster's
playing dead to ambush us,

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:44.749
then we'll hurry back here.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:45.833
[IZ]
Sounds good.

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:47.793
Whatever the situation
turns out to be,

00:18:47.835 --> 00:18:50.004
I have faith that
Maple can protect us.

00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:51.505
I'll do what I can!

00:18:51.547 --> 00:18:53.215
'Kay, we're gonna
go check things out!

00:18:58.012 --> 00:18:59.013
[RISA]
Maple!

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:07.521
You suppose that's one of
the really strong monsters?

00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:09.398
Looks that way.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.733
At least, it was.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.528
[RISA]
I feel sorry for it.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.947
I mean, it was working
so hard to stay alive.

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:19.075
But hey, the important
thing is to make sure

00:19:19.116 --> 00:19:20.785
we stay alive, isn't it?

00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:22.536
We had no choice.

00:19:22.578 --> 00:19:24.121
More importantly,
the fact that the monster

00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:25.915
was able to make it
as far as he did means

00:19:25.956 --> 00:19:28.834
there must be a hole in
our defenses after all.

00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:29.669
[RISA]
Yeah.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:32.380
And when you take into account
that it was a flying monster,

00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:34.048
it could be a sign that
we don't have enough

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:36.634
anti-aerial traps set up.

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:37.677
Huh?

00:19:37.718 --> 00:19:39.470
[KAEDE]
Get a load of those materials!

00:19:39.512 --> 00:19:42.348
All this from that one monster?

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.100
If this is the only trap
we have to reset,

00:19:44.141 --> 00:19:45.351
it shouldn't take long.

00:19:45.393 --> 00:19:47.603
Let's ask the others to help.

00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:48.729
Good idea!

00:19:48.771 --> 00:19:50.815
I want a good night's sleep,
so let's take this chance

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:52.316
to bolster our defenses!

00:20:13.838 --> 00:20:15.464
[KUROMU sighs]
All right.

00:20:15.506 --> 00:20:17.049
That should keep
us safe for now.

00:20:17.091 --> 00:20:18.467
What do you say, Sally?

00:20:18.509 --> 00:20:21.220
It's still pretty early, so why
don't we do something fun?

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:23.139
Yeah, okay. Like what?

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.390
How 'bout a game?

00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:25.558
Let's all play together!

00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:29.061
[ADMIN]
What's the current status?

00:20:29.103 --> 00:20:31.355
[F ADMIN] Things are pretty much
going according to plan.

00:20:31.397 --> 00:20:33.524
Although, the players who've
tamed powerful monsters

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:36.610
are having an easier time
surviving than we anticipated.

00:20:36.652 --> 00:20:39.155
[ADMIN B] But that was why we
added them in the first place,

00:20:39.196 --> 00:20:41.073
so isn't this is the
result we wanted?

00:20:41.115 --> 00:20:42.867
[ADMIN C] Looks like our
enhanced night monsters

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:44.368
put up a heck of a fight!

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.620
[SECRETARY] And yet, it appears
the parties that took defensive

00:20:46.662 --> 00:20:49.582
measures against them
escaped relatively unscathed.

00:20:49.623 --> 00:20:52.460
Almost every single member of
both Order of the Holy Sword

00:20:52.501 --> 00:20:55.713
and Flame Emperors
are still alive at this hour.

00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:58.841
[ADMIN] Should I even
ask about Maple Tree?

00:20:58.883 --> 00:21:00.551
[SECRETARY]
Let's check the video feed.

00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:15.858
[ADMIN]
H-How in the world?

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.402
[F ADMIN] They created
their very own dungeon.

00:21:18.444 --> 00:21:20.154
[ADMIN B] And it's a whole
lot deadlier than anything

00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:22.323
we've ever created.

00:21:22.364 --> 00:21:25.159
[ADMIN C] They've turned this
into a tower defense game.

00:21:25.201 --> 00:21:27.286
[ADMIN]
Uh, what's Maple doing?

00:21:27.328 --> 00:21:28.370
[KAEDE laughs]

00:21:28.412 --> 00:21:30.456
[SECRETARY] They seem to
be having fun, don't they?

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:32.958
Like students on an
overnight field trip.

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:35.461
[F ADMIN] Well, I mean, we knew
going in that even a monster

00:21:35.503 --> 00:21:38.088
enhanced to that degree
wouldn't be a match for them!

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.841
And besides, the event's
just getting started!

00:21:40.883 --> 00:21:41.884
[ADMIN B]
That's right!

00:21:41.926 --> 00:21:43.844
The monsters are gonna
get stronger and stronger

00:21:43.886 --> 00:21:44.970
from here!

00:21:45.012 --> 00:21:47.389
[SECRETARY] Regardless, Maple
Tree is already at too great

00:21:47.431 --> 00:21:48.516
an advantage.

00:21:48.557 --> 00:21:50.851
Could designing such a
sprawling cave have been

00:21:50.893 --> 00:21:52.853
an unforgivable blunder?

00:21:52.895 --> 00:21:54.688
[ADMINS groan]

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.482
Ah, but if we'd made it smaller,

00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:58.275
then the fact that it was a
dummy would have been

00:21:58.317 --> 00:21:59.652
immediately evident.

00:21:59.693 --> 00:22:02.238
Yes, I do believe this
was the right call.

00:22:02.279 --> 00:22:03.405
[ADMIN]
I agree!

00:22:03.447 --> 00:22:04.323
[F ADMIN]
Me, too!

00:22:04.365 --> 00:22:05.366
[ADMIN B]
Same here!

00:22:06.742 --> 00:22:09.495
[SECRETARY] The first day will
be coming to an end soon.

00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:11.747
We must carefully monitor
what actions they take

00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:12.790
on the second day.
