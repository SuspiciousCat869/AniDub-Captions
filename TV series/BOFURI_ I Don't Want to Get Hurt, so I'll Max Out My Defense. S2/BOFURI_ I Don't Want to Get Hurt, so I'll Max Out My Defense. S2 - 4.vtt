WEBVTT

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.223
[RISA]
All right!

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:16.350
It's time to take on day two!

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:19.228
Let's see.
The event is five days total.

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.189
So, considering we got through
floor three yesterday...

00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:24.358
Yeah, we're going
at a good pace.

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:26.944
But even so, what if we
were the first ones

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:28.695
to conquer the top floor?

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:29.863
[KAEDE]
Mm-hmm.

00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:31.406
Let's make that our goal!

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:09.296
What lovely weather.

00:02:09.338 --> 00:02:11.381
Look, Sally! The sea's up ahead!

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:16.595
Check that out!

00:02:19.723 --> 00:02:20.932
A sea turtle!

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.643
Oh, wow! So cool!

00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:24.436
Could that be the
boss of this floor?

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:25.896
Okay, hear me out.

00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:28.190
Don't you wanna take
a ride on that turtle?

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:29.232
[RISA]
Say what?

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:33.320
Just a short one?
A teeny weeny one? Huh?

00:02:33.362 --> 00:02:34.946
Fine, a teeny weeny one.

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:39.618
[F ADMIN B] I just finished
adjusting the monster encounter

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.286
rate on the third floor.

00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:42.204
[ADMIN B]
Thank you!

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:44.873
[ADMIN C] I'm exhausted.
We got any energy drinks?

00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:47.334
[ADMIN A] Maple and Sally
are on the fourth floor, right?

00:02:47.376 --> 00:02:48.543
How's that going?

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:50.587
[SECRETARY]
In a word, relaxing.

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:51.755
[ADMINS]
Huh?

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:05.977
[ADMIN B]
Yeah, sure enough.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.688
[ADMIN A]
I'd call that relaxing.

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:08.897
[RISA]
Hey, Maple?

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.024
Shouldn't we be moving
on to the next floor?

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:12.275
[KAEDE]
Yeah, you're right.

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:15.153
I'm really gonna miss this
nice, cool shell, though.

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.113
[SECRETARY]
Ah!

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:18.323
It would appear they'll be
fighting the boss shortly.

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:19.491
[F ADMIN B]
Don't worry about it!

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:21.076
This is the boss
of the whole floor,

00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:22.828
so it won't be
taken down easily!

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.288
[ADMIN B] Yeah! And it doesn't
take damage through the shell,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.040
so what can they do from there?

00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:28.166
[RISA]
Web User!

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.628
[RISA]
Woohoo!

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.380
Here comes "Seeping Chaos!"

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.634
Now, Triple Slash!

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:39.678
Fireball!

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.055
[F ADMIN B whining]

00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:43.640
[ADMIN C]
They pulverized it.

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:48.228
[MONSTERS growl]

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.355
Now then, Warrior Arms!

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:52.899
[yells]

00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:56.194
[KANADE]
Elemental attacks are effective.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.612
I'll use flame cutter!

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:03.952
Kuromu!

00:04:03.994 --> 00:04:05.412
Are you all right?

00:04:05.454 --> 00:04:06.329
[KUROMU]
Yeah!

00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:09.166
This kinda thing is what
shielders do best!

00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:10.625
You guys! Look out!

00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:15.172
That was a close one.

00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:16.465
But our real target...

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:17.507
...is here!

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:24.931
You ready for this?

00:04:26.183 --> 00:04:28.185
[KUROMU] Once I create
an opening, go for it!

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:31.980
Get a load of this!

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:37.444
[MAY, YUI yell]
Double Strike!

00:04:39.905 --> 00:04:43.074
They're not Maple, but they're
terrifying in their own way.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.368
Ha. I'm glad they're
on our side.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.871
You think Maple and Sally
are doing all right?

00:04:47.913 --> 00:04:50.081
[KUROMU] This floor is pretty
much Sally's worst nightmare.

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:51.666
Well, you're not wrong there.

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:52.959
I'm curious.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.421
[KAEDE roars]

00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:00.926
[KAEDE]
A-ha-ha! A-ha-ha!

00:05:04.221 --> 00:05:06.056
[KAEDE]
A-ha-ha!

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:08.433
Okay, that was the last of 'em!

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:10.101
It's safe now, Sally.

00:05:15.023 --> 00:05:16.191
Carsick.

00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:17.484
[ADMINS groan]

00:05:17.526 --> 00:05:19.778
[F ADMIN B] Well, I have to
admit, I didn't see that coming.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.489
[ADMIN B] I mean, holding your
friend inside your mouth?

00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:24.449
[ADMIN C] What do you suppose
the inside of her mouth

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:25.951
actually feels like?

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:27.494
[SECRETARY]
Inappropriate question.

00:05:27.536 --> 00:05:29.246
[ADMIN C]
What'd I say?!

00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:31.039
[ADMIN A] Let's check in
on the front-runners.

00:05:35.043 --> 00:05:36.169
[FREDERICA sighs]

00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:40.590
So, tell me, why do I feel like
I'm working harder than usual?

00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:41.800
It's simple.

00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:44.094
Having a small party
puts a greater strain

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:45.637
on each member.

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:47.931
And hey, you were
the one who suggested

00:05:47.973 --> 00:05:50.183
we keep the party
small this time.

00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:54.479
Words have consequences,
Frederica. Good lesson.

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:55.981
I know what I said.

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.567
It's because Sally went
it alone with Maple, right?

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:01.528
You heard about that, and you
just had to follow her lead.

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.363
What difference does it make?

00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:06.658
Still, though. Taking this on
as a small group is good for us.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.577
Yeah! No doubt about that!

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:12.163
Astutely observed!
I'm very impressed!

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.082
Is there some
reason they're here?

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:15.917
Well, we can always
use 'em as shields.

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:17.752
[crash]

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:19.254
There.

00:06:19.296 --> 00:06:21.965
Best of luck!
We're rooting for you!

00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:23.717
For real, why are they here?

00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:33.435
I'm counting on you!

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:34.436
[DREAD]
Back atcha!

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:36.271
But--hey!

00:06:36.313 --> 00:06:39.274
Multi-Acceleration!
Multi-Energize!

00:06:39.316 --> 00:06:41.318
War Song! Boost Morale!

00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:44.321
Fissure!

00:06:47.908 --> 00:06:49.117
[DREAD]
Bypass Armor!

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:50.493
Whirlwind Flurry!

00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:52.787
Expand area!
Sword of Judgment!

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:58.460
Whuh-oh! Power Axe!

00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:00.921
Frederica!

00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:03.423
Send all our buffs over
to Payne right away!

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:05.759
[FREDERICA]
You got it! Multi-Augment!

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:10.055
[PAYNE yells]

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.681
Sword of Eradication!

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:18.229
All right! Now that's
what I call power!

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:19.940
We're now at the halfway point.

00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:22.275
If we're all good on
our skills and stamina,

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:23.735
let's push on.

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.362
I'm totally fine.

00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:27.906
I wanna be the
first team through!

00:07:27.948 --> 00:07:29.407
[DRAG]
I like the sound of that.

00:07:31.743 --> 00:07:32.786
So do I.

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:37.999
[SHIN] Still nothing but ice
and snow as far as the eye

00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:39.334
can see.

00:07:39.376 --> 00:07:40.961
We'll have to count on
Mii to carry us through

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:42.212
the boss fight.

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:45.340
Thought we'd never make it down.
I'm spent.

00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:48.218
Thanks for finding and disarming
all those traps, Markus.

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:50.303
The cliff certainly
was perilous.

00:07:50.345 --> 00:07:51.554
That's for sure.

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:54.265
Those weren't just any
ordinary traps back there.

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:55.684
If we'd gotten caught--

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:57.686
[SHIN]
Stop. We get it.

00:07:57.727 --> 00:08:01.439
What do you think, Mii?
Shall we take a short breather?

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:03.066
Might as well.

00:08:03.108 --> 00:08:05.443
We'll stop for five minutes
to allow Markus to recover

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:06.695
his strength.

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:08.780
After that, we continue.

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:10.281
--[SHIN] Got it!
--[MARKUS] Got it.

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:11.491
[MISERY]
Understood.

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:15.578
[MII]
I wonder how far Maple's gotten.

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:18.623
[KAEDE]
What?

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:20.917
Payne's party is on
the eighth floor already?

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:22.002
Guess so.

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:24.546
Frederica couldn't wait
to message me about it.

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:26.548
[KASUMI] If their party is
as small as I've heard,

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:28.341
this kind of progress
is impressive.

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:29.509
Gotta work hard...

00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:31.177
...so we don't fall behind!

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:32.721
[KUROMU]
Your spirit is admirable,

00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:34.764
but we should really
rest for the night.

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:37.183
So, how far did you two make it?

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:39.227
Thank you! We made it
through the sixth floor,

00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:41.062
so we're about to
start the seventh.

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:43.356
I do have to say, I'm pretty
curious to find out

00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:45.775
how Sally was able to
deal with the sixth floor.

00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:47.986
Yeah? Well, you can
just keep wondering.

00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:49.863
It's from Mii.

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:51.489
[MII]
How's it going for you two?

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.283
We're working on
the seventh floor!

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:56.369
Let's get tea together
again when this is over!

00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:59.080
Wow. She's doing great!

00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:01.624
Right! Can't let
myself fall behind!

00:09:07.756 --> 00:09:09.007
Split-Sword!

00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:17.182
Go! Flame!

00:09:20.351 --> 00:09:21.811
[MARKUS yells]

00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:24.647
Breath of the Gods!
And Healing Light!

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:25.815
Nice, Misery!

00:09:25.857 --> 00:09:28.109
Yeah. You saved me.
Thanks for that.

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.029
Here it comes again!

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:32.363
Heavy Fire!

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:36.201
Our best move is to
keep hitting it with fire.

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:39.245
Hey, Misery.
Help me keep my MP up.

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:40.830
You got it, Mii!

00:09:40.872 --> 00:09:44.501
[MII]
Flare Accel! Inferno!

00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:48.671
[ADMIN A] Mii's party got
through the seventh floor

00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:49.839
no problem.

00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:51.841
[F ADMIN B]
Maple Tree's doing well, too!

00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:53.802
[SECRETARY] Maple and Kuromu's
parties have reached

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:56.179
the eighth floor at
nearly the same time.

00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:57.889
[ADMIN C] Which is just
slightly after Payne's

00:09:57.931 --> 00:09:59.182
party did.

00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:01.142
[ADMIN B] Exactly the three
guilds you'd expect!

00:10:06.397 --> 00:10:08.316
Oh, no! Not again!

00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:10.193
We can't see it anymore!

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:11.694
Where in the world is it?

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:14.447
[KASUMI grunts]
No--

00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:16.658
Kasumi!

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:23.456
Sorry. Thanks for the help.

00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:25.333
These anti-sleep potions.

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:27.001
I'm starting to think I should
have given more of them

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:28.461
to Maple and Sally.

00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:35.760
Normally, a single hit is all
you need to wake up

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:37.887
from "sleep" status.

00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:39.681
But Maple isn't
taking any damage,

00:10:39.722 --> 00:10:41.349
so she just keeps sleeping.

00:10:44.727 --> 00:10:45.770
[F ADMIN B]
All right!

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:48.189
That sleep attack stopped
Maple in her tracks!

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:49.774
[ADMIN C]
Status effects rule!

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:52.819
[SECRETARY] And now Sally
has defeated the boss.

00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:53.945
[ADMIN A groans]

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:01.244
[RISA]
Maple? You okay?

00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:03.788
[KAEDE]
Mm-hmm. Getting there!

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.416
Guessing I can't call
Syrup here, either.

00:11:06.457 --> 00:11:08.418
Maple! Keep moving!

00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:11.004
[KAEDE grunts]

00:11:11.045 --> 00:11:13.631
That was close!
Whew. And up!

00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:16.593
Hey! What's that?

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.897
Maple. There.

00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:29.814
Great!

00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:31.232
Just gotta know where to aim.

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:34.360
Machine God! Deploy Armaments!

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:38.114
Take us straight to the boss!

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:45.705
[KAEDE yells]

00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:48.249
Knock-back?

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:50.710
Maple!

00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:52.170
[KAEDE yells]

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:53.755
[RISA grunts]

00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:57.050
--Here. C'mon.
--Thanks, Sally.

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:01.346
[RISA]
Now, we counterattack!

00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:02.388
[KAEDE]
Roger!

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:07.852
Against a target of this size?

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:09.812
Ha! Wind Cutter!

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:12.523
[KAEDE]
Awesome, Sally!

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:14.859
And now, get ready for... Hydra!

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:17.111
[RISA] It countered with
the same attack type?

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:19.280
It's mimicking us! Be careful!

00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:21.699
[KAEDE] You couldn't have
mentioned that a little earlier?

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:27.664
Man. This won't be easy.

00:12:27.705 --> 00:12:30.291
But the good news is,
our attacks are working,

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:31.584
which means--

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:35.505
It's gonna take quite a while
to chip away at its health

00:12:35.546 --> 00:12:37.799
if we have to
avoid its counters.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.551
[KAEDE]
Drill Armaments! Deploy!

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:41.678
Maple?

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:45.848
[KAEDE]
Heavy Body!

00:12:47.016 --> 00:12:48.768
That should take care
of the knock-back!

00:12:51.562 --> 00:12:57.568
[KAEDE yells]

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:05.535
[yelling continues]

00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:19.799
We did it, Sally!

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:21.092
So we did.

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:23.219
[ADMIN B] And with that, Maple
and Sally make their way

00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:24.804
to the tenth floor.

00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:26.097
[ADMIN A]
With Mii and Payne there too,

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:28.558
pretty much all the top
players have arrived.

00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:30.018
[SECRETARY] They've
progressed far more quickly

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:31.185
than anticipated.

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:32.854
[F ADMIN B whines]

00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:34.230
[ADMIN C]
It's not over yet!

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:37.066
Some of them barely
have any HP left!

00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:40.028
[ADMIN A] All we can do now is
watch as the very best players

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:43.364
out there take on the strongest
boss we've ever made.

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:53.624
The tenth-floor boss.

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:55.043
Right off the bat, huh?

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:02.300
Are you ready?

00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:03.384
Totally!

00:14:03.426 --> 00:14:04.385
Shall we, then?

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:05.720
Yeah! Let's go!

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.516
[KAEDE]
Ha!

00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:11.726
[RISA grunts]

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:15.104
[KAEDE coughs]

00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:16.272
[RISA]
Maple!

00:14:19.692 --> 00:14:22.278
[RISA] Too heavy, too fast,
and too strong!

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.909
[KAEDE]
Cover Move! Cover!

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:33.706
[RISA]
Nice!

00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:36.167
Provocation!

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.420
Deploy Armaments!

00:14:39.462 --> 00:14:40.838
Commence Attack!

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:46.386
And once more!

00:14:47.428 --> 00:14:48.638
Maple! Look!

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:52.058
Oh, no!

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.267
[KAEDE yells]

00:14:54.268 --> 00:14:55.728
[KAEDE yells]

00:14:56.938 --> 00:15:00.274
And now, fixed damage that can't
be reduced? Come on!

00:15:05.196 --> 00:15:06.406
It's so strong.

00:15:06.447 --> 00:15:09.283
Yeah. It is the
final boss, after all.

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:10.618
[KAEDE]
What do we do?

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.453
[RISA] I'll do something
about its speed.

00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:14.705
Once it stops moving,
both of us hit it

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:16.290
with everything we've got.

00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:17.959
[KAEDE]
That's a nice, simple plan.

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:21.087
And don't worry, I'll be
sure to keep you safe.

00:15:21.129 --> 00:15:22.547
Great. Thank you!

00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:24.340
[KAEDE]
Loving Sacrifice!

00:15:24.382 --> 00:15:25.716
Throne of the Heavenly King!

00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:27.844
Oboro! Awaken!

00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:35.893
Dark Fire! Torrent! Ancient Sea!

00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:50.199
[RISA grunts]

00:15:51.325 --> 00:15:53.870
Mirage! Double Slash!

00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:55.538
Oboro! Shadow Clone!

00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:06.632
Triple Slash!

00:16:13.347 --> 00:16:14.640
What's happening now?

00:16:19.729 --> 00:16:21.063
Not one opening.

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:29.030
Maple! Now!

00:16:29.071 --> 00:16:30.573
Here! Frozen Earth!

00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:33.701
Power Attack!

00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:34.660
[KAEDE]
And Hydra!

00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:35.870
And Seeping Chaos!

00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:37.079
And Predator!

00:16:41.459 --> 00:16:43.419
Ah! It changed its pattern?

00:16:46.714 --> 00:16:48.382
[KAEDE]
Ah... Atrocity!

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.179
[KAEDE yells]

00:16:58.142 --> 00:17:00.394
[KAEDE yells]

00:17:00.436 --> 00:17:02.146
[RISA]
Maple! You okay?

00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:05.316
Uh, yeah. Kind of.

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:07.443
[RISA] You should cancel
Loving Sacrifice.

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:09.612
It might throw an
AoE attack at us.

00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:12.573
[KAEDE] Okay.
Just make sure you dodge.

00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:13.824
I'll try.

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:15.576
Deploy Left Hand!

00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:16.619
Here goes!

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:18.079
Oboro, Phantom World!

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.039
[OBORO barks]

00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:21.457
Commence Attack!

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:34.387
[KAEDE]
And now...!

00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:37.682
Again!

00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:43.354
[KAEDE]
Sally!

00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:45.231
[RISA]
Quintuple Slash!

00:17:51.487 --> 00:17:53.447
We've almost got him!
Keep it up!

00:17:53.489 --> 00:17:54.532
Right!

00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:04.125
Hey, don't use Cover Move.

00:18:04.166 --> 00:18:06.252
With damage doubled,
we can't afford it!

00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:08.504
Okay! Provocation!

00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:09.672
Counting on you!

00:18:11.173 --> 00:18:13.050
Now, Syrup! Awaken!

00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:14.385
Bastion, go!

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:15.469
[SYRUP]
Turtle!

00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:17.221
Turr--

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:19.432
Turtle!

00:18:19.473 --> 00:18:20.766
No! Syrup!

00:18:20.808 --> 00:18:21.976
Super Speed!

00:18:25.229 --> 00:18:26.731
[KAEDE]
Seeping Chaos!

00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:30.151
This is wild!

00:18:30.192 --> 00:18:31.527
But we're almost there!

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:44.123
[RISA]
Uh-oh. I can't avoid it!

00:18:44.165 --> 00:18:45.958
No! Cover Move!

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.084
Maple?

00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:49.795
[KAEDE grunts]

00:18:51.714 --> 00:18:53.215
Ow.

00:18:53.257 --> 00:18:54.925
Heal!

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:56.636
[KAEDE]
Here comes Frozen Earth!

00:19:01.682 --> 00:19:03.017
And Break Core!

00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:07.647
Break Core takes five
seconds to activate.

00:19:07.688 --> 00:19:10.358
And Frozen Earth only
lasts three seconds.

00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:11.442
[RISA]
In which case...

00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:13.569
Ice Pillar! Sand Wall!

00:19:17.114 --> 00:19:18.741
I think we've finally got him!

00:19:29.543 --> 00:19:31.420
Huh? Seriously?

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:38.719
[KAEDE yells]

00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:42.306
[RISA] You used Cover
Move after I said not to!

00:19:42.348 --> 00:19:43.849
And yet...

00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:46.060
[KAEDE yells]

00:19:46.102 --> 00:19:48.521
[RISA] ...that's the only
reason I made it in time!

00:19:50.272 --> 00:19:51.607
Empty Shell!

00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:19.593
[BOTH laugh]

00:20:19.635 --> 00:20:22.012
We did it!

00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:24.515
[RISA]
It sure was hard, wasn't it?

00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:27.476
Mm-hmm. And that's what
made it so much fun!

00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:31.522
[SECRETARY] Payne's party
conquered the tower first,

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:34.233
then Mii's party,
and now Maple and Sally

00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:36.277
have cleared it, too.

00:20:36.318 --> 00:20:38.320
[F ADMIN B] Is it wrong that
I'm proud of them for fighting

00:20:38.362 --> 00:20:39.280
so hard?

00:20:39.321 --> 00:20:40.865
[ADMIN A] It's not like we
set out to make a game

00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:42.366
that can't be beaten.

00:20:42.408 --> 00:20:45.327
The excitement when someone wins
is what makes it all worthwhile!

00:20:45.369 --> 00:20:47.830
[ADMINS]
Yeah! You said it!

00:20:47.872 --> 00:20:49.498
[SECRETARY chuckles]
Is that so?

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.751
At any rate, their victory
will be rewarded

00:20:51.792 --> 00:20:54.628
with silver medals
and some new skills.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.338
[ADMIN B] I only hope these
new skills don't lead to

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.882
anything weird.

00:20:57.923 --> 00:21:00.050
[ADMIN C] Let's cross that
bridge when we come to it.

00:21:02.636 --> 00:21:04.305
Water Manipulation.

00:21:04.346 --> 00:21:07.141
I'm guessing that's a skill
that lets you control water?

00:21:07.183 --> 00:21:10.102
Could be pretty interesting,
depending on how it's used.

00:21:10.144 --> 00:21:12.855
And you picked up
Unbreakable Shield, didn't you?

00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:15.649
I did end up taking a lot
of damage this time.

00:21:15.691 --> 00:21:18.027
Hopefully this will help
improve my blocking.

00:21:18.068 --> 00:21:21.447
Wait, so now you'll
be even tougher?

00:21:21.489 --> 00:21:24.074
Ah. I see you guys
made it back first.

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:26.160
We just finished ourselves.

00:21:26.202 --> 00:21:28.245
[laughs] Good job, everyone!

00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:30.790
Well, I suppose this means
you've beaten us.

00:21:30.831 --> 00:21:33.334
[IZ] Even a tower like that
is no sweat for Maple.

00:21:33.375 --> 00:21:34.919
We fought hard too, though.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.337
And did our best!

00:21:36.378 --> 00:21:38.088
Anyway, now everyone
in our guild

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:39.799
has conquered the tower.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.217
Guess what, Maple!

00:21:41.258 --> 00:21:42.718
They're saying Level
Seven will come out

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.345
after the event is over!

00:21:44.386 --> 00:21:46.096
Wow! Really?

00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:47.014
Yeah!

00:21:47.056 --> 00:21:49.475
So, let's go beat
the Level Six boss!

00:21:49.517 --> 00:21:51.268
Level Six boss?

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.728
[KAEDE]
Huh?

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:53.813
Oh, yeah.

00:21:53.854 --> 00:21:56.649
Guess that's gonna be
a problem for Sally, huh?

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:59.985
No worries!
I've got a solution ready to go!

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:10.746
Not sure how I should
react to this.

00:22:10.788 --> 00:22:12.790
[KASUMI] I'm choosing not
to think about it.

00:22:12.832 --> 00:22:14.834
That's your plan. Interesting.
