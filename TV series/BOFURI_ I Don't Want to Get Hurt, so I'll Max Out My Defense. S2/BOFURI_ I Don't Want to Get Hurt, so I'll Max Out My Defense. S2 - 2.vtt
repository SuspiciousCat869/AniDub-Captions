Right!

[KUROMU]
Now we can go to Level Five!

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:19.621
I'm good.

No worries.

00:01:21.123 --> 00:01:23.542
And Kasumi?

00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:26.253
[KASUMI] I didn't take any
damage from the enemy, but--

00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:28.213
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:31.049

Thanks for letting
me see it in action!

[MAY, YUI]
Kasumi! You're so cute!

00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:41.268
[KUROMU] Maple's definitely
gonna be sorry she missed this.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.978
[RISA] I can't believe she
came down with a cold

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.064
on the very day Level
Five was released.

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:48.191

that time of year.

[RISA]
Sure took you long enough.

00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:03.498
Level Five's old news by now.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.001
I'm still gonna
check it out today!

00:02:06.043 --> 00:02:08.253
A guildmaster can't let
themselves fall behind,

00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:09.338
you know!

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.340
I wish I could join you.

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:14.384
I need to log off soon, but
maybe someone else can go.

00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:15.552
You wanna ask?

00:02:15.594 --> 00:02:18.472
That's okay!
I'll take 'em on solo!

00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:22.517
It was a good idea at the time,

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.562
but can I really handle
some super-strong boss

00:02:25.604 --> 00:02:26.897
on my own?

00:02:28.732 --> 00:02:30.484
Excuse me!

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:33.403
Hmm?

Ah...

Is this not the entrance?

00:02:41.912 --> 00:02:43.997
I'll try this!

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:47.292
Okay. How's this?

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:48.335
[KAEDE gasps]

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.048

[TOWER KEEPER]
Well.

00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:58.637
Wasn't expecting
a human to show up.

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:04.393
I'm gonna beat you and
move on to Level Five!

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:08.313
Sure. You can try, human!

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:09.773
Yah!

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:12.984

easy on me, though!

How did the others manage
to defeat this guy?

Oh, that's right!

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:40.071
I could try that!

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:42.115
Even though I hate getting hurt.

00:04:42.157 --> 00:04:44.159
Return to your
original form, Syrup!

00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:48.246

such high defense.

--[SYRUP] Turtle!
--I'm sorry!

That was Break Core.

It hurts the user as
well as the enemy.

Uh, hey. Are you all right?

Huh?

00:05:40.257 --> 00:05:42.050
So, what is this?

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:43.969
From this day on,
you can enter this tower

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.262

How wonderful to have
a worthy heir at long last!

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.308
Huh? That's fine, I guess,
but what I really want

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.893
is to get to Level Five.

00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:56.898
I've acquired some new skill
called Pandemonium One.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.234
Wait, does that mean this
place isn't the entrance

00:05:59.276 --> 00:06:00.569

I can't believe I've been in the
wrong place this whole time.

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:17.127
Now I have to
start from scratch.

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:22.215
[FREDERICA]
Hey! Is something wrong, Maple?

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:27.846
It's nice to see you Frederica,
Dread, Drag and, um... uh,

00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:29.431
all the rest of you?

[DREAD]
I see.

00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:33.727
So, it was a cold that
was keeping you away

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:35.103
from Level Five.

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:37.647
That's why. I was beginning
to wonder why I hadn't spotted

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:40.358
that flying turtle
of yours there yet.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.028
Huh. Defeating the wrong
boss completely.

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:44.571
How very like you.

00:06:44.613 --> 00:06:46.823
Oh. That's a compliment.

00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:50.076
What are you guys still doing
in Level Four, though?

00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:52.162
You should've reached
Level Five by now.

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:54.623
Well, we did.

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:57.000
But some of our newbies
are lagging behind,

You won't take any damage.

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:14.476
Yes, Dread, sir!

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:17.270
I appreciate this lovely
AoE protection.

have a go at that thing?

Sure! I have a new skill.

Good for you, Maple.

00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:14.327

be sure to let me
know, okay? Bye!

how did we help, again?

softer than my bed!

Oh, Maple!

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.326
You made it to Level Five!

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:57.829
Guess this means you've
recovered from your cold?

00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.331
Yeah! I'm fine now.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:03.126
Anyway, are the two
of you just logging in?

00:09:03.168 --> 00:09:05.962
Actually, well, the thing is...

00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:08.882
We lost a battle with a
really powerful monster.

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:11.009
One that uses lightning attacks.

00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:18.058
Even though we
fought really hard,

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:20.268
we weren't able to defeat it.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:21.644

you're here with us,

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:23.188

All right! Loving Sacrifice!

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:41.289
That's the attack that
finished us off before!

00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:43.583
But this time's different!

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:45.168

maxing out that attack!

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:07.649

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:10.318
Thanks to you, Maple!

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.987
Oh, looks like we
picked up a new skill.

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:14.280
Let's see.

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:16.783
Apparently, this lets us
attack with lightning.

00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:18.451
Though, I guess it
doesn't really matter,

00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:21.329
considering neither of us
can use magic skills.

00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:22.413
Huh.

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:25.375
The one I got is different,
possibly because

00:10:25.416 --> 00:10:27.252
my strength stat is zero.

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:30.130
It's, uh, "Throne of
the Heavenly King."

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:35.718
Ah! Nice!

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.930
Not only is it pretty,
but it grants AoE defense!

00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:41.057
It automatically restores
the HP of the one

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:42.851
sitting in it. Too cool.

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:45.186
And it can even seal
the skills of your enemy!

00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:46.604
Not bad, huh?

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:48.690
Yeah, but do you really
need that when you already

00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:50.483
have Loving Sacrifice?

00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:53.736
And besides, what's the use
of having AoE defense skills

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:55.947
if your movement is limited?

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:57.532
Don't worry about it!

00:10:57.574 --> 00:10:59.701
It's not like I'm going after
all these weird skills

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:02.078
intentionally, so
whatever happens is fine!

00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:05.874
[MAY]
It's a message from the admins.

00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:08.501
Wow! They say they're about
to release Level Six.

00:11:08.543 --> 00:11:10.545
It's coming Wednesday!

00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:12.255
[KAEDE]
What? Already?

00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:15.425
In that case, I need to wrap
up Level Five, and fast!

00:11:15.466 --> 00:11:16.593
[YUI]
Yeah, us too!

00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:18.011
[MAY]
Let's hurry!

00:12:01.095 --> 00:12:02.680
[KAEDE]
Loving Sacrifice!

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:13.691
Go Double Stamp! Go Double
Stamp! Go Double Stamp!

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:17.195
[KANADE] At times like this, all
we can do is stand by and watch.

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:19.322
True. Though, it is nice
not having to use

00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:21.032
Purple Phantom Blade.

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:23.076
I love their enthusiasm,
but I kinda wish

00:12:23.117 --> 00:12:24.702
I could at least get a hit in.

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:34.462
[IZ] Now we can advance
to Level Six as a group.

00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:36.297
[KUROMU] I'd have thought May
and Yui would wipe out

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:38.174
that boss in one blow.

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:40.343
It just goes to show the
monsters are getting stronger

00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:41.844
with each new level.

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:44.305
But now we have our
new skills from Level Five,

00:12:44.347 --> 00:12:46.015
so it evens out.

00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:47.267
Right!

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:49.269
Whatever challenges
they throw at us,

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.647
we have absolutely no
reason to be... scared.

00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:57.819
[KUROMU] Level Six appears
to be horror-themed.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.196
Sally? Are you okay?

00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:02.490
Yes, thank you.

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:03.783
[KAEDE]
You are not!

00:13:04.867 --> 00:13:08.246
[RISA] You're right.
I'm really, really not!

00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:13.751
[KAEDE] Do you think you'll
be able to handle it, Risa?

00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:14.961
[RISA]
Not a chance!

00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:17.672
I can't deal with horror in
any way, shape, or form!

00:13:17.714 --> 00:13:19.465
As far as I'm concerned,
New World Online

00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:21.175
doesn't have a Level Six!

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:22.760
I'll just grind in
the other areas,

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:24.929
then skip directly
to Level Seven!

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:26.848
And that will be that!

00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:28.850
Okay, but hear me out.

00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:30.685
There's lots of info
out about Level Six

00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:32.186
and it might change your mind.

00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:34.230
No pressure.
I just had to say it.

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:35.606
[RISA]
Fair enough.

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:36.691
And good luck out there.

00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:39.527
[sighs]

00:13:40.903 --> 00:13:44.073
I won't change my mind. Please!

00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:45.867
No chance of that happening.

00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:48.119
But I wonder what info
she's talking about.

00:13:51.122 --> 00:13:52.415
Wait, what's this?

00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:54.709
Level Six has an
agility-boosting skill?

00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:56.836
And shoes that let you fly, too?

00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:59.547
Oh, man!
I want both of 'em so badly!

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:02.467
What do I do?

00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:10.099
[RISA whimpers]

00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:18.649
Sally! You showed up!

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:20.193
How are you feeling?

00:14:20.234 --> 00:14:21.819
Was it difficult for you?

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:24.489
Ugh! Just getting this
far was a trial beyond

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.074
all comparison.

00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:27.408
If you'd told us
you were coming,

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.160
we'd have gone out to meet you.

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:30.411
You're too kind.

00:14:30.453 --> 00:14:32.497
But I couldn't allow myself
to become an imposition

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:34.290
on the rest of the guild.

00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:35.958
But why have you come here?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.628
I thought you weren't going
to return to Level Six.

00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:40.380
Is there a particular
item you want to find

00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:42.131
or something?

00:14:42.173 --> 00:14:45.385
Yes. And I know just
where to look for it.

00:14:45.426 --> 00:14:48.554
Unfortunately, the place really
scares the crap out of me!

00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:49.847
Okay, okay!

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:51.516
I am coming with you!

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:53.935
We hadn't made plans yet anyway!

00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:55.186
For real?

00:14:55.228 --> 00:14:57.939
Thank you, thank you, thank
you, thank you, thank you!

00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.524
Sure! Now let's go!

00:15:03.361 --> 00:15:05.530
[RISA] Ah! Even from up this
high, you can see how creepy

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:06.906
it is down there.

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:09.325
Oh, yeah. Where're we headed?

00:15:09.367 --> 00:15:12.036
If we just keep going this way,
we should find a mansion.

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:13.246
That's where we--

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:16.124
[RISA screams]

00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:17.542
Nuh-uh! I'm done!

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:20.336
[KAEDE]
Sally, that's dangerous!

00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:21.504
Be careful!

00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:24.465
We've come this far,
so let's see it through!

00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:29.554
Sally, take a look!

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:31.472
This has to be it, right?

00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:34.350
[RISA whimpers]
You promise the coast is clear?

00:15:34.392 --> 00:15:36.144
It's totally safe!

00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:39.105
Now, is this the place
we're looking for or not?

00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:40.148
Well?

00:15:44.986 --> 00:15:46.404
This is it for sure!

00:15:46.446 --> 00:15:48.364
Just look how terrifying it is!

00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:50.741
Perfect! Time to head in, then!

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:52.827
You have got to
believe in yourself.

00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:54.871
Clear your mind and
try to remain calm.

00:15:54.912 --> 00:15:56.747
You're fine!
I'm right here!

00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:58.040
Please, hang on!

00:15:58.082 --> 00:15:59.876
I'm still psyching myself up!

00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:01.752
I'm sorry, but you're the
same girl who once took

00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:03.504
more than an hour to
work up the nerve to go

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:06.132
into a haunted house
and we simply do not have

00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:07.633
that kind of time!

00:16:07.675 --> 00:16:08.885
Machine God!

00:16:09.927 --> 00:16:12.096
--[RISA] Uh, hey. Wait--
--[KAEDE] Now then, let's go!

00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:15.600
--[yells]
--Coming through. Excuse me!

00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:16.934
[RISA yelps]

00:16:17.727 --> 00:16:19.645
[KAEDE]
Ooh!

00:16:19.687 --> 00:16:21.689
It's even bigger on the inside!

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:25.568
Now where are we supposed to go?

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:29.322
[RISA] Uh, I haven't been
able to find a detailed map.

00:16:29.363 --> 00:16:32.158
I only know it's
somewhere in this mansion.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.119
Guess there's nothing to do
but search the whole building.

00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:36.621
Well, listen, Maple.

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:39.665
The monsters here are
pretty strong, I'm guessing.

00:16:39.707 --> 00:16:41.626
Maybe instead of
wandering aimlessly,

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:43.586
we should come back when
we know where to look.

00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:44.754
[KAEDE]
No way!

00:16:44.795 --> 00:16:46.464
We're gonna go find that item!

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:48.424
All we have to do
is stick together!

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:58.059
[KAEDE]
Nope! Nothing in here!

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.188
Don't see anything.

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:06.526
Checking rooms randomly
is gonna take a while.

00:17:06.567 --> 00:17:07.610
[RISA]
No kidding.

00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:10.613
But even still, Maple,
stay close to me.

00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:12.198
Certainly!

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.576
Whatever happens, you can
count on me to keep you safe!

00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:16.994
Great. Thank you.

00:17:20.456 --> 00:17:22.667
Maple, save me!

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:23.834
Sit tight, okay?

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:33.302
There. All taken care of.

00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:42.436
Hey, Maple, where'd
you disappear to?

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.771
Uh, Maple?

00:17:55.533 --> 00:17:57.285
It's not letting me log out!

Am I trapped in here?

Maple! Maple, where are you?

Sally! Where are you, Sally?

00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:20.349

like crazy! Sally!

I need your help.

What's wrong, Sally?
Don't you recognize me?

Throne of the Heavenly King!

00:19:07.438 --> 00:19:09.148
You hang in there, Sally!

Maple!

00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:14.904
It's all right.

00:19:14.945 --> 00:19:17.114
They can't get to us
if we stay here.

00:19:21.452 --> 00:19:23.871
[KAEDE]
Well? Feeling better?

00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:25.706
[RISA]
Yeah, a little bit.

00:19:25.748 --> 00:19:27.583
Though, I'm too ashamed
of myself to show

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:29.835
my face quite yet.

00:19:29.877 --> 00:19:33.798
Aww. I knew this
was a terrible idea.

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:36.592
I feel so stupid for thinking
maybe I could handle it.

00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:38.010
So, now what?

00:19:38.052 --> 00:19:39.595
Do you want to keep looking?

00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:44.642
Hey. What's going on?

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:47.436
[BLAZING BROTHERS yell]

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.063
[yelling continues]

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.528
I see now!

00:19:55.569 --> 00:19:57.238
A new group of
adventurers showed up

00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:59.740
and all the monsters
got distracted!

00:19:59.782 --> 00:20:01.117
[RISA]
What does that mean?

00:20:01.158 --> 00:20:03.786
It means we have
a chance to escape!

00:20:03.828 --> 00:20:05.121
[KAEDE, RISA yell]

00:20:05.162 --> 00:20:06.580
[yelling continues]

00:20:14.004 --> 00:20:17.550
Hey, it looks like we
can log out from here.

00:20:17.591 --> 00:20:19.176
I'm free!

00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:20.761
Quick, let's get going before--

00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:26.016
[RISA screams]

00:20:30.312 --> 00:20:31.772
Well, would you look at that?

00:20:31.814 --> 00:20:33.816
You learned a new skill!

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:35.025
Let me see.

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:37.319
The "Connection to
the Underworld" skill.

00:20:37.361 --> 00:20:38.821
Item effects are doubled!

00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:40.197
Well, look at that!

00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:41.824
I guess you earned it by
spending a certain amount

00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:43.409
of time in the mansion!

00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:45.161
I'm so proud of you, Sally!

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:52.543
[RISA sighs]

00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:54.670
I seriously can't believe
it's possible to feel

00:20:54.712 --> 00:20:58.299
this exhausted from
playing a video game.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.926
Ugh. Oh, man. So sweaty.

00:21:00.968 --> 00:21:03.429
Better take a bath.

00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:05.973
Hey, Mom? Is the bath ready?

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.436
"I'm out taking care of
neighborhood association

00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:13.355
business, and your father's not
expecting to be home till late,

00:21:13.397 --> 00:21:16.233
so please have dinner by
yourself and don't wait for us.

00:21:16.275 --> 00:21:18.569
Be safe, okay? Mom."

00:21:22.656 --> 00:21:23.866
[CAT meows]

00:21:26.368 --> 00:21:28.287
[KAEDE]
What's going on, Risa?

00:21:28.329 --> 00:21:31.165
[RISA] Um, Kaede?
Do you have a minute?

00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:32.666
[KAEDE]
For you, of course!

00:21:32.708 --> 00:21:33.667
What's up?

00:21:33.709 --> 00:21:36.003
[RISA] Well, it occurred to
me that I put you through

00:21:36.045 --> 00:21:39.465
a lot today, so I
thought I'd check in.

00:21:39.507 --> 00:21:40.800
Oh, yeah?

00:21:40.841 --> 00:21:43.594
But you know,
this sounds kind of familiar.

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:45.387
--[RISA] It does?
--Yep!

00:21:45.429 --> 00:21:48.098
Remember the time we went
to that haunted house?

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.351
That night, you called
me from your bathtub,

00:21:50.392 --> 00:21:52.770
home alone and scared silly.

00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:55.189
[RISA]
Nothing gets past you, huh?

00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:57.900
Sorry. Mind staying on
with me for a bit?

00:21:57.942 --> 00:21:59.235
[KAEDE]
I'd be happy to!

00:21:59.276 --> 00:22:00.444
So, you're home alone now?

00:22:00.486 --> 00:22:04.031
Yeah. So, uh, just until
whenever my parents get home,

00:22:04.073 --> 00:22:05.157
if you're sure.

00:22:05.199 --> 00:22:07.701
[KAEDE] I already told you,
it's no problem!

00:22:07.743 --> 00:22:10.246
Oh, by the way,
you're good at math, right?

00:22:10.287 --> 00:22:12.248
Can I ask you something
about our homework?

00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:13.833
[RISA]
Sure. What is it?

00:22:13.874 --> 00:22:15.251
[KAEDE]
Well, here's the thing.
