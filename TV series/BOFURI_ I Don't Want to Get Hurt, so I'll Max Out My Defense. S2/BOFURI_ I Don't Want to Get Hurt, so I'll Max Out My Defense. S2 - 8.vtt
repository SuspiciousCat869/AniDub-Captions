00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:11.178
Syrup! Spirit Cannon!

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.221
Turtle!

00:00:17.893 --> 00:00:18.894
[KAEDE]
What's this?

00:00:18.936 --> 00:00:21.146
Red Flower Garden, huh?

00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:22.523
Awesome!

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:24.816
Evolving gets you a
bunch of new skills!

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.193
That's my Syrup!

00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:27.819
Turtle.

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:29.780
[KAEDE] And I've gotten pretty
good with these tentacles.

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:32.241
Let's keep going and
level up even further!

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.036
I should've guessed you
had something to do with

00:00:36.078 --> 00:00:38.121
all that commotion, Maple.

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:39.331
[MARKUS]
Whoa. So it's true;

00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:42.125
you really do have
tentacles. Crazy.

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:43.502
It's a good thing Mii warned us,

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:45.003
or we might've taken
you for a monster

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.421
and chopped 'em right off.

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:48.006
Oh, hey, Flame Emperors.

00:02:24.895 --> 00:02:26.605
So, uh, what's up?

00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:28.899
The turtle.
It's different somehow.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.609
[KAEDE]
Oh! How observant!

00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:35.572
That's because... I guess
you could say it's a secret.

00:02:35.614 --> 00:02:37.824
Right. You definitely don't
wanna go around giving

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:39.326
all your secrets away.

00:02:39.368 --> 00:02:40.911
Not right before an event.

00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:43.705
I take it you and Syrup
are out here leveling up?

00:02:43.747 --> 00:02:45.791
Yeah! And you?

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:46.708
[SHIN]
Yup.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.211
Got our tamed monsters
with us, too. Wanna see?

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:50.295
Yes!

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:52.839
Hmm. Well, it's certainly
not like you're hiding

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:54.758
your companion from us.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.760
So, I guess there's no harm.

00:02:56.802 --> 00:02:58.053
Awaken!

00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:01.264
[KAEDE]
Ah!

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:02.557
This is Wen.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:03.934
So, what do you think?

00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:06.311
Pretty darn cool looking,
wouldn't you say?

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:08.105
Yeah! Super cool!

00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:11.983
Somehow, I knew you'd be
able to appreciate him.

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.819
You just wanted to show off.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.905
Hey! Eh, who am I kidding,
he's got me there.

00:03:16.947 --> 00:03:18.198
Okay, you guys are up.

00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:22.202
What do you think, Misery?

00:03:22.244 --> 00:03:25.580
I don't see a problem.
Come on, let's show her!

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:26.623
[MARKUS]
Well, then.

00:03:26.665 --> 00:03:27.749
[MARKUS, MISERY]
Awaken!

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:31.670
Meow.

00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:35.507
Aww! They're both so cute!

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:39.720
Sorry about that.

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:41.471
Bell here's a bit skittish.

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:44.015
Try not to do anything to
freak out Clear up there.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.519
No. Of course not!

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:49.938
Right, then. I guess we
better get back to it.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.983
Thanks so much for allowing
me to meet your companions.

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:54.943
Sure. Though you just might
have to go up against 'em

00:03:54.985 --> 00:03:56.194
in the next event.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:58.947
We'll have to meet the rest of
Maple Tree's monsters soon.

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.532
I'm looking forward to it!

00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:01.742
Bye-bye.

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:02.784
Bye!

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:07.289
[KAEDE] So many different
monsters out there.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.582
[SYRUP]
Turtle.

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:13.462
[DORAZOU]
Rawr! The wait is over!

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:15.672
I promised you details
on the eighth event,

00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:17.758
and now I'm gonna
give them to you!

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.801
[GROUP]
Ah!

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:22.637
[DORAZOU] As you already know,
this event will be divided

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:25.140
into a preliminary
and a main event.

00:04:25.182 --> 00:04:27.309
The preliminary is
a survival match.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.478
You'll get points based
on how long you survive

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:31.772
and how many
monsters you defeat.

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:33.982
The points you earn there
will be used to determine

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:37.360
what difficulty level you play
at during the main event!

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:39.946
So, what it comes down
to is how many monsters

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:41.865
you can kill before you die.

00:04:41.907 --> 00:04:44.326
[KUROMU] Considering the
bonus for staying alive,

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:45.577
you can't afford to die.

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:47.412
[DORAZOU] And just to
keep things interesting,

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:49.080
we put some little
gimmicks in place

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.540
for when you defeat monsters!

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:52.667
So, we can never let our
guard down, not even after

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:54.044
we've bested our foe.

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:55.962
What's "gimmick"
supposed to mean?

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:58.173
I'm in! Sounds exciting.

00:04:58.215 --> 00:05:00.550
[DORAZOU] Players are free to
assist or obstruct each other

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:01.718
as they see fit.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.970
But be aware that points
for killing a monster

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:06.139
will only be awarded to
the player who delivers

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:07.349
the final blow.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.184
I hope someone
will team up with us.

00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:12.103
Yeah. We're way too
slow to do it alone.

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:14.773
I'll tell you more about
the main event later on.

00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:16.608
The preliminary starts soon,

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.152
so make sure you're ready
for it when it does!

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:21.196
Bye now! And rawr!

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:25.367
[RISA] All right.
So, tell us, Guildmaster.

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:26.535
What's the goal here?

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:28.245
Obviously, for all eight
of us to make it

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:29.788
to the highest difficulty!

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.081
We've got some time.

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:34.668
Let's go level up so we can
dominate that preliminary!

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:36.002
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:49.766

--Yay! Yay! Yay!

[DORAZOU]
Rawr!

00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:24.593
Okay. Welcome to
the eighth event!

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:26.845
Time to start the preliminary!

00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:29.347
Is everybody ready
for adventure?

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:32.392
Let's all do our best! Go team!

00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:34.769
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:38.231
[DORAZOU]
And away we go!

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:50.952
Well, it doesn't look
like anyone's here.

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:54.039
Better look around and see
if I can find any monsters!

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.749
Here goes. Predator!

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.835
Wonder if anything'll show up.

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:06.843
Paralyze Shot!

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:12.182
Looks like a strong one.

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:13.600
Better use Devour, too.

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:20.190
All right.

00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:22.817
That one may have gotten
the jump on me at first,

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:25.070
but I think this is going well!

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:26.655
'Kay! Next!

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:27.864
Gotcha!

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:30.784
Take that!

00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:47.884
Wait! Hold on!

00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:52.222
Hey, come back!

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:56.851
Aww. Everything's running
away from me,

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:59.646
and I can't move quickly
enough to catch them.

00:07:59.688 --> 00:08:01.439
Is there anything I can do?

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:03.108
Whoa, what's this?

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:04.818
Buffs? Debuffs?

00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:06.861
When did I get these?

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:08.738
Oh. I guess these
must be the gimmicks

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.156
they were talking about.

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:12.534
Let me take a look
at this one over here.

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:15.036
It makes monsters run
away at the sight of you?

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:19.124
Slow down!

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:25.880
Please. I need to
get some points!

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:27.340
--[SYRUP] Turtle.
--[KAEDE] Aww...

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:34.806
[KAEDE]
What do we have here?

00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:40.937
Well, it's not running away,
so I guess it isn't a monster.

00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:52.365
I see!

00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:54.242
It must be some kind of
trap that draws monsters

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:55.285
toward it!

00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:56.995
And right now,
that's just what I need!

00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:59.456
Okay, Syrup!

This one makes my location
information available

to other players.

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:34.365

get through this, Tsukimi!

There you are, my little kitten!

[BLAZING BRO A] We found each
other out here through the power

00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:55.929
of our brotherly bond.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.472
[BLAZING BRO B]
And now we've found you!

How terribly unlucky for you!

And now we'll finish
you in one blow, baby!

Hey, wait!

You're leaving both of your
older brothers behind?

[TSUKIMI]
Bear-bear!

00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:43.184
Sis! It's you!

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:44.185
Yui!

00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:46.271
[YUI]
I found you! Thank goodness!

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:47.939
How's it going for you so far?

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:50.358
With Yukimi's help,
I'm doing great! Right?

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.609
Bear-Bear!

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.778
--Check this out, though.
--[MAY] What?

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.405
[MAY]
Huh? That's Maple!

00:10:55.446 --> 00:10:56.614
[YUI]
Looks like it.

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.366
[MAY] All those monsters
are after her.

00:10:58.408 --> 00:10:59.617
Should we go there?

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.911
[YUI] Mm-hmm. I'm not sure
how much help we'll be,

00:11:01.953 --> 00:11:04.706
but at least we can try!

00:11:04.747 --> 00:11:06.207
From Iz?

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:08.251
That message will let the
others know to steer clear

00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:09.669
of this area.

00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:11.588
All right, let's do this.

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:13.798
Fay. Forest's Wrath!

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.758
[FAY]
Fay!

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.051
Fay!

00:11:18.553 --> 00:11:21.389
--[IZ] Strengthen Item!
--[FAY] Fay!

--[IZ] Spirit's Mischief!
--[FAY] Fay!

00:11:24.475 --> 00:11:26.519
[IZ]
Should be just about here.

00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:27.520
And now...

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:31.774
Fay, String Water!

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:34.319
[FAY]
Fay!

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:37.322
Thank you, Fay. Well done.

00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:38.364
[FAY]
Fay!

00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:44.120
Just in case.

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:46.080
Fay, Fairy's Protection.

00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:47.624
[FAY]
Fay!

00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:49.209
Now, here we go!

00:11:56.257 --> 00:11:57.383
What's that?

00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:02.931
[KUROMU]
What is she thinking?

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:05.767
Is she trying to destroy
the whole forest?

00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:07.602
If I'd wandered into that,
I'd have been blown

00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:09.729
to smithereens for sure.

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:11.856
Hope I never miss
a message from Iz.

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:12.899
Anyway...

00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:19.113
Let's go, Necro!

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:20.240
Armored!

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:23.743
Necro! Reflect Impact!

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:26.996
Flames of Death!

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:36.631
[laughs] Time to rack
up some points!

00:12:38.007 --> 00:12:39.968
This is all you, Necro!

00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:41.844
Ghost Charge!

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:43.096
Burst Flame!

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:48.268
Whew.

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:49.727
After being
surrounded like that,

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:52.021
it's good to take a moment
to catch your breath.

00:12:52.063 --> 00:12:54.440
Okay, time for one last rush!

00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:56.192
You ready, Necro?

00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:58.278
[TSUKIMI]
Bear! Bear! Bear...!

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:01.155
[YUI] Maple's surrounded
and badly outnumbered!

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:03.533
We have to do what
we can to help her out!

00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:16.546
[MAY]
Pretty sure...

00:13:16.587 --> 00:13:17.839
[YUI]
...we can leave her be.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:18.965
[MAY]
Mm-hmm.

00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:20.216
[YUKIMI]
Bear!

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:22.844
[KAEDE roars]

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.020
I'm sorry.
I can show no mercy.

00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:33.688
Now, Earth! Awaken!

00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:38.443
[DREAD] Can't pass up an
opportunity to take out a rival.

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:39.777
Shadow, Awaken!

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:43.573
I may be at a
slight disadvantage.

00:13:43.614 --> 00:13:44.782
Go, Wood Wall!

00:13:45.575 --> 00:13:47.076
[DRAG]
Earth! Sand King!

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:52.582
Fissure!

00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:57.587
[KANADE]
Firestorm!

00:13:58.629 --> 00:14:00.340
[DREAD]
Shadow! Shadow Dive!

00:14:03.926 --> 00:14:05.178
Shadow Clone!

00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:08.097
[DREAD]
Shadow, Shadow Pack!

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:20.234
[DREAD]
Triple Slash!

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:33.289
[DRAG]
Almost too easy.

00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:35.458
Still, it was
two-on-one, wasn't it?

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:36.959
Huh? What's wrong?

00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:38.169
[DREAD]
Don't worry about it.

00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:40.129
We saw the death
effect and everything.

00:14:40.171 --> 00:14:41.839
I was just being paranoid.

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.132
Let's get moving, guys.

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:47.637
[DRAG] Hey, don't go lumping me
in with your tamed monster!

00:14:47.678 --> 00:14:48.721
Jeez!

00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:51.140
But yeah, on to the next one.

00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:53.601
[sighs] That was close.

00:14:53.643 --> 00:14:56.270
Guess there's no way I could
have pulled that one out.

00:14:56.312 --> 00:14:58.481
But you did great, Sou.

00:14:58.523 --> 00:15:01.943
Thanks to Division and Mimic,
we didn't suffer any losses.

00:15:01.984 --> 00:15:04.570
And I was able to get a look
at their tamed monsters,

00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:05.822
so it wasn't a waste.

00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:10.535
[laughs] Those two
were pretty strong.

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:12.870
Still, the result will
be different next time.

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:16.874
[BLAZING BRO C] Man, what's
the deal with this forest?

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:18.626
I'm going in circles.

00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:20.461
How do I get out
of here, anyway?

00:15:22.463 --> 00:15:25.967
[gasps] Hey. Why can't
I move, huh?

00:15:26.008 --> 00:15:29.053
--[KASUMI ]Flash!

[KASUMI]
Super Megamorph.

00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:35.476
A useful skill, to be sure.

00:15:35.518 --> 00:15:37.270
I sense something over there.

00:15:37.311 --> 00:15:38.521
Let's go!

00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:41.899
It's gonna charge!

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:43.443
We can do this, sister!

00:15:43.484 --> 00:15:44.652
Blood Blade!

00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:47.822
[F PLAYER A yelps]

00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:50.783
Hey, who are you?

00:15:52.243 --> 00:15:53.703
Oh, no! Sister!

00:16:06.924 --> 00:16:09.510
This territory belongs to us.

00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:12.054
All who trespass upon
it will be cut down.

00:16:12.096 --> 00:16:13.139
Right, Haku?

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:18.603
Wonder how everyone's doing.

00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:23.024
As far as I can tell, Maple
hasn't moved from that spot

00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:25.401
for a while now.

00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:26.861
And is that Mii?

00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:28.988
Well, there's not
much time left.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.781
Might as well scout that way.

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:33.326
[MAY] Thanks for warning us
about what you were planning,

00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:34.368
Iz.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.871
[YUI] It was like a
beautiful fireworks show!

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:38.915
[IZ laughs]
Maybe I overdid it a little.

00:16:38.956 --> 00:16:42.168
But the goal here is to make
sure we all rank high, isn't it?

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.879
[KUROMU] Never seen fireworks
quite like that before.

00:16:44.921 --> 00:16:46.380
Heard from the others?

00:16:46.422 --> 00:16:49.133
[KUROMU] Not really, but I'd
be willing to bet Sally

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:51.761
and Kanade are holding
their own out there.

00:16:51.802 --> 00:16:53.638
As for Maple...

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:55.389
She's not moving.

00:16:55.431 --> 00:16:57.308
It might be some kind of trap.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.977
Yeah, possibly even
a boss dungeon.

00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:02.355
[KUROMU] Well, I'm sure
she's handling it.

00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:04.690
[KAEDE]
Hmm.

00:17:04.732 --> 00:17:06.734
Well, I've already used
up a lot of my skills,

00:17:06.776 --> 00:17:08.486
so what should I do next?

00:17:08.528 --> 00:17:10.238
I'm pretty sure I'm good
to go as far as points

00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:11.531
are concerned.

00:17:11.572 --> 00:17:13.199
Doing a little
exploring could be fun,

00:17:13.241 --> 00:17:14.867
but at the same time...

00:17:16.827 --> 00:17:19.288
Ah. Now this could
be interesting.

00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:23.918
Didn't think I'd run into you.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.754
[PAYNE] I've hunted more
than enough monsters.

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:29.549
Now it's time to test the
strength of my rivals.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:33.844
That's funny, because I was just
thinking the very same thing.

00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:35.012
Heavy Fire!

00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:36.180
Sword of Radiance!

Linked Flame!

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:42.270

00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:04.375
Ray! Megamorph!
Holy Dragon's Breath!

00:18:08.212 --> 00:18:11.007
Ah, yes. A fine monster.

00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:12.675
As is your dragon.

00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:16.053
But if you're attempting
to conceal your strength,

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:18.180
you'll be burned into ashes!

00:18:18.222 --> 00:18:21.434
Ignis! Phoenix Flame!
Become Fire!

00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:33.946

Infierno!

00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:37.825
[PAYNE]
Ray! Holy Guard!

00:18:47.084 --> 00:18:48.919
[MII] You took all that
with damage reduction

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.921
and the power of
your holy sword?

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:53.883
I imagine you would've
liked to see Ray's attack,

00:18:53.924 --> 00:18:57.303
but that's not something I
can reveal to you so easily.

00:18:57.345 --> 00:19:00.723
You never intended to defeat me
in the first place, did you?

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:04.060
Still, can't let you
leave unscathed.

00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:05.853
You really think
you can stop me?

00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:12.526
[KAEDE]
Go! Go! Go!

00:19:17.948 --> 00:19:19.700
[KAEDE]
Yeah, there you go!

00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:22.828
Ah... Maple?

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:24.914
[KAEDE laughs]

00:19:24.955 --> 00:19:27.750
I can't remember the last
time I had this much fun!

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:30.378
I feel like I could keep
on going forever!

00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:34.840
[laughing]
Yay!

00:19:34.882 --> 00:19:36.300
Woohoo!

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.387
Think we're done.

00:19:39.428 --> 00:19:42.348
Payne, let's continue
this another time.

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.850
Yes. Agreed.

00:19:44.892 --> 00:19:46.352
[KAEDE]
That's cool! Whatever!

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:54.652
What the heck are
you doing, Maple?

00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:59.156
[laughing]

00:19:59.198 --> 00:20:01.742
[RISA]
Maple! What's going on here?

00:20:01.784 --> 00:20:02.993
Oh, Sally!

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:04.829
Wait till you hear
what happened!

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:07.206
So, I got eaten
by this alligator.

00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:08.582
But no matter what I did,

00:20:08.624 --> 00:20:10.376
I couldn't seem to
get into its stomach.

00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:12.044
[RISA]
Wait, you were trying to?

00:20:12.086 --> 00:20:14.547
So, long story short,
this is how it turned out!

00:20:14.588 --> 00:20:16.424
[RISA]
Okay, that explained nothing.

00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:19.301
Hey, look! I can do this!

00:20:19.343 --> 00:20:20.344
And this, too!

00:20:22.096 --> 00:20:23.639
And then, when I do this...

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:26.517
Wee!

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:29.311
It actually controls
surprisingly well!

00:20:29.353 --> 00:20:32.898
And I can still use my laser
to take down monsters!

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.483
This is the greatest!

00:20:34.525 --> 00:20:36.444
Oh. That's right, I was just
looking at the map

00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:38.154
and it said Mii was here.

00:20:38.195 --> 00:20:39.321
Did I run past her?

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.034
I swear, there's never
a dull moment.

00:20:45.411 --> 00:20:48.706
[ADMIN B] Hey, anyone remember
putting in an area boss here?

00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:50.207
[ADMIN C]
Nah, don't think so.

00:20:50.249 --> 00:20:51.959
[ADMIN B]
Well, take a look at this.

00:20:52.001 --> 00:20:54.128
[ADMIN A] What in the world
is she doing now?

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.130
[SECRETARY] It was a wise
move not giving that creature

00:20:56.172 --> 00:20:57.173
a stomach.

00:20:57.214 --> 00:21:00.009
We could have been looking
at another internal explosion.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.011
[ADMIN B] We should just stop
making monsters with insides,

00:21:02.052 --> 00:21:03.304
period.

00:21:03.345 --> 00:21:04.638
[ADMIN C]
Aw man, if only we'd thought

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.640
to give its teeth
a piercing effect!

00:21:06.682 --> 00:21:08.476
[SECRETARY]
If you'll pardon me a moment.

00:21:08.517 --> 00:21:10.019
[ADMIN A]
What, is there something else?

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.563
[SECRETARY] We're receiving
a deluge of complaints.

00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:14.064
"So poorly balanced."

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:15.566
"Are you going to
make this right?"

00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:17.318
"It's not fair!"
And so on.

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:18.569
[ADMIN A groans]

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:20.237
[F ADMIN A] Do they really think
we meant for things

00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:21.697
to turn out this way?

00:21:21.739 --> 00:21:23.240
[ADMIN B]
It's not our fault!

00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:25.451
How many times am
I gonna have to say it?

00:21:26.452 --> 00:21:28.954
[ADMIN C]
It's just so brutal.

00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:31.624
[ADMIN A] Ugh!
Where did I put my antacids?

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.794
[KAEDE]
Yes! We all got high rankings!

00:21:34.835 --> 00:21:36.170
Congrats, everyone!

00:21:36.212 --> 00:21:38.672
You wanted to do more
exploring, right, Maple?

00:21:38.714 --> 00:21:41.133
Well, maybe the main event
will use the same field.

00:21:41.175 --> 00:21:43.010
If so, we should
search it thoroughly.

00:21:43.052 --> 00:21:44.637
There may be medals to be had.

00:21:44.678 --> 00:21:47.014
I do enjoy combat, but exploring

00:21:47.056 --> 00:21:49.350
lets you see so
many beautiful places.

00:21:49.391 --> 00:21:51.227
I really love that!

00:21:51.268 --> 00:21:52.937
I'm glad we all did well.

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:54.480
That's something to celebrate.

00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:57.107
I must say, Tsukimi did
a really great job!

00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:58.692
Yukimi, too!

00:21:58.734 --> 00:21:59.944
All right!

00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:02.530
Let's do our best
in the main event

00:22:02.571 --> 00:22:05.032
and get tons of medals,
and get even stronger!

00:22:05.074 --> 00:22:07.243
We are still a
relatively small guild,

00:22:07.284 --> 00:22:09.620
so each of our members
needs to pull their weight.

00:22:09.662 --> 00:22:11.080
Yeah!

00:22:11.121 --> 00:22:13.290
I wonder if the main
event will start soon.

00:22:13.332 --> 00:22:14.416
Hope so!
