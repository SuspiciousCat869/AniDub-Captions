Believe it or not,

00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,125
we just had an altercation
with the master of a familiar

that goes by the
name of Kumomaru.

So I gotta know, fancy pants,
are you with them?

That is correct.

We're both familiars
to the same master.

are in order.

For your rash behavior
toward my master.

you may consider the undeniable

Of course, we would
provide suitable compensation.

that Harutora's power

isn't what I meant.

I wanted to check in
on the status

325
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,791
of Yakou's re-awakening, Chief.

326
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:47,000
To determine if it was just
his soul that has been reborn.

327
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,708
Or if his memories or
abilities from his past life

328
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,625
were still intact.

329
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,166
Have we heard anything about
Yasuzumi and the others?

330
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,750
[KURAHASHI] Our operatives
haven't reported

331
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,708
any new information as of yet.

332
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,791
[YASHAMARU] Hmph. Do you think
it's plausible that Yasuzumi

333
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,250
is still in the dark
regarding recent events?

334
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:06,083
[KURAHASHI] No. The man is a
master at reading the stars.

335
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:09,333
If anything he's waiting for
the perfect time to strike.

336
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,625
[YASHAMARU] Mm-hm.
So what you're saying is,

337
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,708
there might be a chance
that he would attempt

338
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,958
to rescue Harutora himself.

339
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,000
[KURAHASHI] He'll have Takahiro
and Chizuru fighting for him.

340
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:22,291
Takahiro is a skilled former
magical investigator.

341
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,833
We need to be careful with them,

342
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:26,708
but at least we have
Miyachi on our side.

343
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:30,250
However, we still have
other causes for concern.

344
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,500
There's also the matter
of a troublesome teacher

345
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,125
at Onmyo Prep School.

346
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,625
Oh? Who?

347
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,000
[KURAHASHI] It's Shadow.

348
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,750
What? I was under the
impression that he retired.

349
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,833
He resigned from the Bureau.

350
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,833
Then my mother hired him.

351
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,875
He was Natsume Tsuchimikado's
homeroom teacher.

352
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:50,000
Oh my! What an
unfortunate situation.

353
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,083
Now we have to deal
with Shadow as an enemy?

354
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,750
That might prove annoying.

355
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:57,708
[KURAHASHI] Don't worry.
I have just the man for the job.

356
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,541
[KURAHASHI] This can't
be made public.

357
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,125
Reports indicate that
a skillful Onmyo mage

358
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,875
has infiltrated
the Onmyo Agency.

359
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,666
I need someone like you
to take him out.

360
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,458
I'm in.
Who's the target?

361
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:14,750
[KURAHASHI] Shadow.

362
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:15,708
Eh?!

363
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,750

[MALE BARTENDER 21A sighs]

365
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,125
[KURAHASHI] Independent
Exorcist, Reiji Kagami,

366
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,541
I hereby release you
from your suspension.

367
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,708
Report to the agency
offices immediately.

368
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,875
I can have some of the
agency staff drive you.

369
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,208
Why don't you kids go
on home for the night?

370
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,666
He's right, Kyoko dear.
Leave this to us.

371
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,541
[KYOKO] Impossible.

372
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,375
Go home and do what?

373
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,791
[KYOKO] Crawl into bed
and go to sleep.

374
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,583
Then face a tomorrow
with no Natsume.

375
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,166
Can I do that?

376
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,750
Is that even a possibility?

377
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:57,250
Principal Miyo!
Have you seen Mister Ohtomo?

378
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,125
What? Why would
you ask me that?

379
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,458
[FUJIWARA] It's something
best discussed in private.

380
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,000
[TOUJI] This is as
good a time as any.

381
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,541
Here goes.

382
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:17,000
Once we get outta here,
I'm breaking into the Agency.

383
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,625
[inaudible]

384
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,041
He did what?

385
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,958
[TOUJI] The Onmyo Agency
is the belly of the beast.

386
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,916
I'll be damned before
I leave my buddy to rot

387
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,916
in a place like that.

388
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,083
I'm going to sneak in
and break him out.

389
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,958
That's impossible, moron!

390
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,666
Now listen.
Let's say you sneak in.

391
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,291
You have no idea where
Harutora is being held.

392
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:40,083
And there won't be a map
with a "you are here" sticker.

393
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,458
You're right.

394
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:42,708
[TENMA]
Doing something that stupid

395
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,416
isn't going to
accomplish anything.

396
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,083
You might as well stay at home.

397
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,500
[TOUJI sighs]

398
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,333
Stop and think.

399
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,625
Let's talk with Kogure
and the principal.

400
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:57,166
We might have a chance to win,
then, even if it's the slow way.

401
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,708
I'm sorry, Tenma.

402
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,208
But I'm thinking about what
that Yashamaru dude said

403
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,458
after the fight.

404
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,208
Like how we're running
out of time to conduct

405
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,583
the Taizan Fukun Ritual

406
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,916
and bring Natsume
back from the dead.

407
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,416
[TENMA gasps]

408
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,416
[TOUJI] If we're doing it, then
tonight's our only chance.

409
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,166
And Mister Monocle
backed off long enough

410
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,041
to give us time to
think things over.

411
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:20,375
I think we have the opportunity
to use that time against him.

412
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,750
I'm telling you, this might
be our one and only shot.

413
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,000
I can feel it in my bones,

414
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,875
this is the perfect
time to make a move.

415
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,791
I don't know what choice
Harutora will end up making.

416
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,458
I feel that given
the opportunity,

417
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,041
he'd sacrifice
himself for Natsume.

418
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,041
If that's the case,
then so be it.

419
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,375
At that point
it's his decision.

420
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,916
But up until that moment,
I will do whatever it may take.

421
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,916
I'll stay with him
until the end.

422
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,625
And see his resolve
with my own two eyes.

423
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,041
Touji...

424
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,208
Oh, and there is one
thing I know for sure.

425
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,583
No way in hell will I be
able to go back to the dorm

426
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,666
and just sleep with all
of this stressing me out.

[KYOKO gasps]

That's the one thing

429
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,000
I definitely couldn't
do right now.

430
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,000
So I'm fighting back.

431
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:07,208
Don't care if it's stupid.
I'm doing it.

00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:12,083
[KYOKO] Well then...

00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,041

Yeah, sort of.

00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:28,166
Hanging around here will
only draw their suspicion.

We let them
take us home.

441

[OHTOMO] The situation has
changed since last we spoke.

I hate to ask for help after
what I said at the hospital.

But I desperately need to cash
in on that favor you owe me.

[DOMAN] My, my. That came
completely out of the blue.

460
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:27,666
So, what would you ask of me?

on my way to attack
