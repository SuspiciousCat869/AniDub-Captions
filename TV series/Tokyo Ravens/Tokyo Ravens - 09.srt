160
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,083
My first attack
may have failed,

161
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,875
but like I told you
before, I am Kon.

162
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,000
Descendant of the
legendary fox Kuzunoha,

163
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,291
and loyal retainer to
the mighty Tsuchimikado--

164
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:22,708
[KON screams]

165
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,375
Kon!!

166
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,583
[HARUTORA wails]

167
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,208
Oh, please, no!

168
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,541
You insolent heathen!

169
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,958
How dare you handle my
Master so discourteously?!

170
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,500
Don't worry about me!

171
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,250
Just promise that
you won't give up!

172
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,583
[KON whimpers]

173
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,166
Your will be done, sir.

174
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,583
Oh, man, this Nue
is hardcore.

175
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,375
Master, watch out!

176
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:59,500
Kon, no!

177
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,833
[TOUJI] It's time to accept it.
To face this head on!

178
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,000
I have friends
that will help me.

179
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:11,041
Friends that will
always be by my side.

180
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,791
I'm not scared of you, ogre.

181
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,583
I refuse to be
afraid of my future!

182
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:21,416
[TOUJI] I can feel
my blood boiling.

183
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,041
The ogre's raging. Alright...

184
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,833
I'll show you how
to focus your anger!

185
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,375
[HARUTORA] Somethin'
wrong, half-ogre?

186
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,333
All that power you had
yesterday is gone?

187
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:42,833
Like it or not,
looks like we're stuck

188
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,666
with each other for a while.

189
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,000
[TOUJI] Harutora!

190
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,208
[TOUJI yells]

191
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,833
[HARUTORA yells]

192
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,000
[DASSAI] That kid just harnessed
the power of the half-ogre!

193
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,083
[KOKURYUU] It's show time!

194
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,833
[HARUTORA] This ends here!

195
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,625
[NUE roars]

196
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,541
Come on. Are you
kidding me, dude?

197
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,666
Qiyi Qiyi, weave a shape
out of formless clouds.

198
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,458
May the firstborn son
of all the world pierce

199
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:49,500
through the mantras, through
space and time themselves.

200
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,500
May he traverse
the very heavens.

201
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,000
To move the hand of the Creator!

202
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:56,250
Qiyi Qiyi, please hear
our prayer!

203
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:01,208
Now! By the power and
benevolence of the Creator.

204
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:04,916
Heaven's fury!
Purify this evil miasma!

205
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,458
Order!

206
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,500
[HARUTORA] Huh?

207
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:45,166
[HARUTORA] The purification...
It worked?

208
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,333
[DASSAI] Yeah,
you're number one!

209
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,000
[KOKURYUU] Eradication
celebration time!

210
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,541
For real?

211
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:51,500
[HARUTORA screams]

212
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,500
[HARUTORA] Not again!

213
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,041
[KON] Don't worry,
I'll catch you!

214
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,333
I'm sorry, but my
power's all used up.

215
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,875
[HARUTORA yelps]

216
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,250
[HARUTORA] Oh, thank god.

217
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,666
[TOUJI] My timing was flawless,
if I do say so myself.

218
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,750
[HARUTORA] Touji?
Why're you riding Yukikaze?

219
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:06,791
Are those horns?

220
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,833
Pretty cool, right?

221
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:11,083
Yeah, man. Not bad!

222
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,500
[KAGAMI] The amateurs
pulled it off! Ah, the irony.

223
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,250
That was one
hell of a display.

224
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,000
And now the rumors about
Natsume Tsuchimikado will gain

225
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:26,958
even more ground and Yakou's
followers will be re-energized.

226
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:27,958
[HARUTORA] Can't believe
we never thought

227
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,708
of taming the ogre.

228
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,208
[TOUJI] Yeah, well...

229
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,500
This whole "ogre power"
thing is just a trial run.

230
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,083
No telling what might
happen next time.

231
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:39,000
What's the matter, Mr. Cool?
You afraid of a little work?

232
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,291
Big talk from a guy who
just got smacked around.

233
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,750
And if I lose
control as an ogre,

234
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,500
remember you're top candidate
for getting eaten first.

235
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:48,250
If you're as late then as
you were today, no worries.

236
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,875
Seriously, though! Today was
a little crazy, wasn't it?

237
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,083
This morning, all I
could think about

238
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,666
was the exam to move
up to the next grade.

239
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,250
[TOUJI] Yeah, right?
I guess it's like they say--

240
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,416
"Every cloud has
a silver lining."

241
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,291
Silver lining?
What silver lining?

242
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,916
Stupid-tora.

243
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,833
Being half-ogre sucks,
but because of it I met you.

244
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:14,708
Which makes me feel a little
grateful for the lame-ass thing.

245
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:15,916
D'ya look at that?

246
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,500
Touji's getting all
sentimental on me now.

247
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:19,541
[TOUJI] Nah.

248
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,291
I think you must've
hit your head.

249
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,791
[HARUTORA] Anyone have a tissue
for poor, sweet little Touji?

250
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,750
We should just stay
out of their way.

251
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,541
Huh?

252
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,458
Of course, I know that!

253
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,583
But I--I still feel
a little jealous.

254
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,041
Yeah, right?

255
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,458
I wish I could connect
with him like that.

256
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,000
It's no fair.

257
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,541
They make it look so easy.

258
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,958
[KAGAMI] Something different
about that half-ogre.

259
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,791
Somehow this reminds
me of Dairenji's

260
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,291
crazy little experiment.

261
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,291
I can practically
smell it on him.

262
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,666
That's no ordinary
ogre in there.

263
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,125
Heh. That's great.

264
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,166
Seriously the best.

265
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,041
Guess it'll be faster
to just let it take over.

266
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,500
Sounds fun.

267
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,000
[OHTOMO] Always pay attention
to your surroundings,

268
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,583
no matter what.

269
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:12,208
Didn't they teach you that
on the first day of training?

270
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,125
Pretty sneaky for a man
with one leg, Shadow.

271
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,958
It has been awhile,
hasn't it, Ogre Eater?

272
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,958
[KAGAMI] So how's the
retired life treating you?

273
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,666
[OHTOMO] It gives me
time for hobbies.

274
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,666
Like taking nighttime walks.

275
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,291
But I like to keep
busy, you know.

276
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,958
So I decided to try
my hand at teaching.

277
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,666
I'm back at Onmyo Prep.

278
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,916
[KAGAMI] Is that so?

279
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,416
Maybe I should pay you
a little visit one day.

280
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,958
You seem to have some very
interesting students.

281
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,958
Yes, but sadly, you
won't have the time.

282
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,375
You'll be far too busy.

283
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,166
I imagine it will
take you quite awhile

284
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,833
to break through
all of these spells.

285
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,375
What're you talking about?

286
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,875
While you were busy making
those thinly veiled threats,

287
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,416
I was casting a litany of spells

288
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,250
I thought you might
find diverting.

289
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,000
And they're all spells
you'll need to look up

290
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,125
in ancient documents if
you hope to break them.

291
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,875
You're just bluffing!

292
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,375
That kinda fake-out is
wasted on me, four eyes.

293
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,791
I've known you too
long for it to work.

294
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,041
And what have you learned
about me in that time?

295
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,291
You know what kind
of person I am.

296
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,625
Think back to your training.

297
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,625
Remember how I always
made you go with me

298
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,458
to the harshest battles
whenever it was possible?

299
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,750
I wanted you to witness
the lengths I would go to

300
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:20,583
should the situation
ever force my hand.

301
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,750
You've also known me
long enough to realize

302
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,041
that even if ninety percent
of what I've said is a bluff,

303
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:29,333
ignoring the other ten percent
could still prove costly.

304
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:32,375
But you knew all that.
Didn't you now?

305
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,750
Well, have fun
with your research

306
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,291
if you choose to go that route.

307
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,250
I certainly wouldn't
try to dispel anything

308
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,583
I don't understand.

309
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,166
Oh, and Kagami?

310
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,875
Remember this.

311
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,125
While there is still
life in my body,

312
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,791
you will not lay a
finger on my students.

313
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,666
[KAGAMI] So first I
find a half-ogre kid

314
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,041
and the possible
reincarnation of Yakou.

315
