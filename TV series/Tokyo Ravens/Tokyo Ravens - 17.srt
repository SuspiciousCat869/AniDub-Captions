[SHAVER]
What's the deal?

168
00:11:37,826 --> 00:11:39,793
You're not even
wearing a talisman?

169
00:11:39,826 --> 00:11:43,326
What if I were to cut off
one of your arms or legs?

170
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:45,459
Would the dragon come out?

171
00:11:45,493 --> 00:11:47,559
[HARUTORA]
Not a chance!

172
00:11:47,593 --> 00:11:48,793
[SHAVER] Shoo.

You gotta calm down!

00:11:52,293 --> 00:11:52,993
Shut up!

176
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:54,659
[SHAVER]
Bring out the dragon.

177
00:11:54,693 --> 00:11:56,659
Bring it out.

178
00:11:56,693 --> 00:11:59,193
[SHAVER] Come on!

179
00:11:59,226 --> 00:12:02,359
What's wrong?
Not so tough now.

180
00:12:02,393 --> 00:12:04,493
[SHAVER] What, did you think
that dressing like a boy

181
00:12:04,526 --> 00:12:07,493
and tricking everyone
would make you stronger?

182
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:08,626
You're a liar.

183

[NATSUME gasps]

Get up, ya freak.

Say something, would ya?

186
00:12:16,493 --> 00:12:19,359
[HARUTORA] It's not enough.
I can't stop him.

187
00:12:19,393 --> 00:12:23,626
I don't have that kind
of power. I'm too weak.

188
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:27,659
I don't have the magical skill
needed to protect Natsume!

189
00:12:27,693 --> 00:12:28,926
But still.

190
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,226
There's got to be a way to beat
the crap out of this bastard!

[groans]

192
00:12:34,593 --> 00:12:38,793
Wait. I didn't start
out as a spirit seer.

193
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:41,759
This let me see into
the spirit world.

194
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:45,493
It is the gate that connects
the inside and the outside.

195
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:49,359
[HARUTORA]
Natsume gave it to me.

196
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:52,559
Focus. For her.

197
00:12:53,326 --> 00:12:55,259
Your gears just
aren't in sync.

198
00:12:55,293 --> 00:12:57,526
Your power and your
gears don't match up.

199
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:03,393
[HARUTORA] Focus.

200
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:05,593
Uh!

201
00:13:24,073 --> 00:13:24,740

Where'd you learn it?

209
00:13:50,307 --> 00:13:52,440
[NATSUME]
How did you do that?

210
00:13:53,807 --> 00:13:55,607
I got this.

211
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,507
[HARUTORA] I can bring
this scumbag down!

212
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,540
I know I can!

213

[SHAVER grunts]

214
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,207
[HARUTORA] I can read
him like a book, now.

215
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,673
Of course. He's
lagged a few times,

216
00:14:12,707 --> 00:14:15,173
but the sword
definitely hasn't.

217
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,807
[HARUTORA] The sword.
It's his talisman!

[HARUTORA]
No way. Come on.

224
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:36,507
I need a stronger
power source.

225
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,140
[SHAVER] Enough.
This is over, now!

Left yourself wide open!

Have a few of these on me!

228
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,173
[HARUTORA]
A strong fire spirit.

229
00:14:50,207 --> 00:14:53,407
One that's a match
for Shaver. Or better!

230
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,573
Natsume. Help me by luring
him into the courtyard.

We'll surprise him. Okay?

00:15:04,673 --> 00:15:06,207
Okay.

[HARUTORA] The fire's
going strong. Now what?

257
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:28,440
To control a fire spirit,
I need a fire spell.

258
00:16:28,473 --> 00:16:32,507
That's it! But I hate the idea
of copying that bully.

[KYOKO] It wasn't Natsume
who forgot his pledge to me.

He never even knew about
it in the first place.

Well all right then.

you'll never forget.

[phone rings]
[AMAMI] Hm?

280
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,774
Bit late for Miyo to call me.

--[MIYACHI] Director Amami.
--[AMAMI] Huh?

282
00:18:12,907 --> 00:18:15,174
Miyachi. Good. How are
things going at Meguro?

283
00:18:15,207 --> 00:18:17,107
Well. Somehow the
spirit disaster made it

284
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,840
all the way up to a Phase 4.

285
00:18:18,874 --> 00:18:21,140
We contained all the damage
to the branch office.

286
00:18:21,174 --> 00:18:23,107
But it's still a real
mess over there.

287
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,274
[MIYACHI] How's your end?

288
00:18:24,307 --> 00:18:26,240
[AMAMI] New information has
cropped up, and I need to

289
00:18:26,274 --> 00:18:28,674
discuss it with the
chief face to face.

290
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:32,140
Hm. I'm on my way there now,
the chief just called me in.

291
00:18:32,174 --> 00:18:33,974
Really?

292
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:36,940
[MIYACHI] I have a bad
feeling about this.

293
00:18:38,274 --> 00:18:40,874
[KURAHASHI] Fill me in
on the operation.

294
00:18:40,907 --> 00:18:43,007
[AMAMI] Unfortunately,
only half of our objectives

295
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,740
were completed.

296
00:18:44,774 --> 00:18:47,040
Ah, then you
were careless.

297
00:18:47,074 --> 00:18:48,940
We only succeeded
in removing a few

298
00:18:48,974 --> 00:18:50,974
insignificant weeds
by the stem.

299
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:54,140
While the Twin Horn Syndicate's
roots remain untouched.

300
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:57,040
But I must say, sir. I now
believe those roots connect

301
00:18:57,074 --> 00:18:59,707
to a different plant entirely.

302
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,540
[KURAHASHI]
Tell me everything.

303
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,174
So the girl was pretending
to be Investigator Hirata.

304
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:07,774
And you believe
that someone else

305
00:19:07,807 --> 00:19:09,507
is in control of the girl.

306
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,974
I understand that much.
But what makes you so sure

307
00:19:13,007 --> 00:19:14,707
that the controller
isn't another pawn

308
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,974
of the Twin Horn Syndicate?

309
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:18,840
Because Hirata's the one
who shot Makihara down.

310
00:19:18,874 --> 00:19:20,207
If the Twin Horn
Syndicate isn't

311
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,240
the united front
we assumed it to be,

312
00:19:22,274 --> 00:19:24,074
then we should
consider the girl to be

313
00:19:24,107 --> 00:19:25,974
part of a splinter
group of some kind.

314
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:28,607
Perhaps a different
faction entirely.

315
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,174
I thought the same,
at first, too.

316
00:19:30,207 --> 00:19:32,507
Until she used the
Imperial pallbearers

317
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,474
against me in battle.

318
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,174
[AMAMI] There are only a
few families in the world

319
00:19:37,207 --> 00:19:39,807
who have access to
Imperial pallbearers.

320
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,107
And this leads me to
believe that the real Hirata

321
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,674
was switched with that girl.

322
00:19:43,707 --> 00:19:45,507
Which most likely
occurred during his

323
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,274
Ghost Division investigation.

324
00:19:47,307 --> 00:19:50,874
And the Imperial Household
ran the Ghost Division.

325
00:19:50,907 --> 00:19:53,540
It's obvious.

326
00:19:53,574 --> 00:19:56,540
One simply has to
connect the dots.

327
00:19:59,974 --> 00:20:01,640
[KURAHASHI] It can't
be helped, can it?

328
00:20:01,674 --> 00:20:02,740
[AMAMI] Huh?

329
00:20:02,774 --> 00:20:04,007
You can come in now.

330
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,707
[door opens]

331
00:20:09,674 --> 00:20:11,840
[AMAMI gasps]

332
00:20:11,874 --> 00:20:13,240
[TAKIKO]
Director Amami.

333
00:20:13,274 --> 00:20:16,740
I apologize for my
disrespectful actions.

334
00:20:16,774 --> 00:20:20,574
I'm Takiko Souma. It's a
pleasure to re-meet you.

335
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,940
If I'm not mistaken,
wasn't Shido Dairenji's

336
00:20:22,974 --> 00:20:25,140
original family name Souma?

337
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:27,507
Takiko's the last
direct descendent.

338
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,540
The last of the Souma line.

339
00:20:29,574 --> 00:20:30,807
[AMAMI] What is the
meaning of this?

340
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,640
Let's put aside
her real name and

341
00:20:32,674 --> 00:20:35,074
whatever her intentions
might be for now, shall we?

342
00:20:35,107 --> 00:20:36,540
There's no way
you can deny her

343
00:20:36,574 --> 00:20:37,907
behind the scenes
involvement with those

344
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,740
Twin Horn Syndicate maniacs.

345
00:20:39,774 --> 00:20:41,940
Which leaves me wondering
why you'd ever let someone

346
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,474
like that within earshot?

347
00:20:45,574 --> 00:20:47,640
Don't expect me to
explain myself to you.

348
00:20:47,674 --> 00:20:49,807
You knew all this and
let the mission go ahead?!

349
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,507
Do you have any idea how many
people died in that raid?!

350
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,874
[MIYACHI clears throat]

351
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,974
It was a decision for
my family to make alone.

352
00:21:00,007 --> 00:21:03,207
A decision for the
Kurahashi family?

353
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,140
That's odd. I don't
think Miyo was

354
00:21:05,174 --> 00:21:07,607
kept in the loop about any
of this business at all.

355
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,174
If she had known about it,
she would have done something.

356
00:21:11,207 --> 00:21:15,040
[KURAHASHI] My mother is not the
head of the Kurahashi family.

357
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,207
[AMAMI sighs]

358
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:27,874
Director Amami. Don't make
this harder than it has to be.

359
00:21:29,574 --> 00:21:32,140
Oh, you foolish old man.

360
00:21:33,274 --> 00:21:35,840
I've never ignored a
woman before in my life.

361
00:21:35,874 --> 00:21:37,807
And this was the
wrong day to start.

362
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,707
I should've answered
your call, Miyo.

363
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,607
I apologize, sir.
It's my fault.

364
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,274
There's no need
for you to worry.

365
00:21:50,307 --> 00:21:53,507
This will officially
be blamed on Hirata.

366
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:56,907
The next step.
Natsume Tsuchimikado.

367
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,707
With the help of
the Raven Coat,

368
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,207
we will be able to
help Lord Yakou

369
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,874
regain his consciousness.

370
00:22:01,907 --> 00:22:04,007
When that happens,
the Twin Horn Syndicate

371
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,674
will purify that body.

372
00:22:05,707 --> 00:22:08,607
And then we shall return
Yakou to his proper form.

373
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,674
We're so close now.

374
00:22:10,707 --> 00:22:13,840
The time for us to meet
him now approaches.

375
00:22:18,274 --> 00:22:19,574
[KURAHASHI]
You may be right.

376
00:22:19,607 --> 00:22:21,574
[TAKIKO gasps
and chuckles]

377
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:25,040
Well then, time to
proceed to the next step.

378
00:22:25,074 --> 00:22:26,974
The time has come
to introduce myself

379
00:22:27,007 --> 00:22:29,774
to Natsume Tsuchimikado.

380
00:24:00,007 --> 00:24:03,674
[KON babbles]
