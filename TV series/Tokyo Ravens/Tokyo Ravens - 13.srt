[DOMAN] Oh, it's you.

00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:13,333
Good job making
it all the way here.

[KAKUGYOUKI]
The magical labyrinth?

00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,208
That wouldn't stop me.

7
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:20,000
Your familiar said you
were about to make a move.

8
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,750
I must've heard wrong.

00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:24,541
[DOMAN] That impertinent
little blabber mouthed fool.

10
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,458
Why do you tolerate
impertinence?

11
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:28,500
Try tightening
the familiar's leash.

[DOMAN laughs]

13
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,916
That one is almost too
feisty for an old man,

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,750
such as myself, to handle!

15
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:37,250
But then, that just makes
it even more thrilling.

16
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:40,625
Course it does.
You've been alive too long.

17
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:43,000
I choose to keep young
by having some fun,

18
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,583
which is more than
anyone could say for you.

19
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,208
[KAKUGYOUKI] Unfortunately,
cheap thrills don't

20
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:49,291
do much for me.

21
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,833
If that's so, then what
do you bother living for?

22
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,625
Are you wandering
around in the dark

23
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:56,916
simply to avoid
having to choose a path?

24
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:02,875
I live simply to find
out why I'm still alive.

--Hurry up, would you?
--Whoa.

Hold on, Hokuto! Be careful.

about me; I'm good!

Is something wrong?

[HARUTORA] Kon?

Nah, I'm okay. It's nothing.

But... But are you sure?

00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,125
[HARUTORA] I said it's nothing.
I'm sorry I woke you up.

[MALE TEACHER 13A] The doctrine
of the Five Elements

41
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,375
consists of two principles:

the rivalry and the
harmonious relationship

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,166
between each element.

44
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,666
The principle of rivalry states
that wood draws energy...

[HOKUTO] I'll keep it forever!

00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,041
[HARUTORA] Do what you want.
I hope you know it cost

47
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,750
way more to win
than it was worth.

48
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,500
Maybe, but I don't care.

49
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,958
[HARUTORA] Why not?

You couldn't even reach

[OHTOMO] Having an abundance
of spirit energy is good,

63
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,791

You impudent hayseed!
Get your paws off of me!

Whoa! Kon, just
calm down already!

He's distant. Like he
doesn't like me anymore.

If you can honestly
think that nonsense,

82
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,458
then you're dumber than
I thought you were,

feelings for Hokuto.

00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,208
And that would mean
he feels the same way

towards you,
now wouldn't it?

[TOUJI] Look, if you're not
going to say anything to him,

90
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,000
then maybe I could
talk to him for you.

91
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:34,041
No, please don't
do that! You can't.

92
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,666
It's something
I should do.

93
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:43,000
[sighs]

94
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,500
So wonderful to
have rain again.

95
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,583
[SUZUKA] Oh! There you are!

96
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,708
I watched the
whole thing, darling.

97
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,291
Wait, so you
saw me in there?

98
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:05,500
[SUZUKA] I was secretly spying
on you guys the whole time, duh.

99
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,375
No one even had
a clue I was there.

100
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,166
Weird.

101
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,625
An invisibility spell, huh?

102
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,583
Classic Divine
General hijinks.

103
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,583
It's really a
rather basic spell.

104
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,541
But you can't even
do that right, can you?

105
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:18,250
How do you expect to improve
if you don't practice, silly?

106
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,416
[HARUTORA] Uh.

107
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,958
All you have to do
is completely release

108
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,625
everything
cluttering your mind.

109
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,833
Which for you, shouldn't
take very long at all.

110
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,375
Huh?

111
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,500
If I do empty my
mind, then, like,

112
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,208
how'm I gonna
remember the spell?

113
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,375
Shut up. Listen.
You need to keep training

114
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,000
until the spell
is second nature,

115
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,916
and you can chant the
damn thing in your sleep.

116
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,208
Uh...

117
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,500
[KYOKO]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

118
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,000
About time, Kyoko.

119
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,250
[KYOKO] It takes a bit longer
for a girl to get ready.

120
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,958
But then, I wouldn't
expect a guy with

121
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,458
less than zero class
to understand.

122
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,208
Oh! Hello Suzuka!

123
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,125
Gross.

124
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,125
You're looking
cuter than ever!

125
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,958
Just like a little
porcelain dollie!

126
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,625
[SUZUKA] Stop glomping
on me you mammary monster!

127
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,875
K, I'm lost.

128
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,666
Since when have the two
of you become so chummy?

129
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,333
Ah-uh! Our Secret.

130
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,500
We aren't chummy!

131
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,708
Aw! You're so cute
when you're angry!

132
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,291
Wait. Where's Tenma?

133
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,708
[TOUJI] He went home already.

134
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,541
[KYOKO] That's weird.
Though now that you mention it,

135
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,416
he did seem a little down.

136
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,625
[KYOKO] I wonder. Maybe his
family said something to him.

137
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:15,791
[HARUTORA] What do you mean?

138
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,208
The Momoe clan is an
influential Onmyo family

139
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,875
and Tenma is their
successor, so they can

140
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,708
be kind of tough
to deal with.

141
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,291
That's rough. I guess I
don't know much about him.

142
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,083
[TENMA]
I have a question, sir.

143
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,208
Is Onmyo magic
aptitude entirely

144
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,500
dependent on innate talent?

145
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,458
It doesn't seem like
something you can master

146
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,458
with hard work alone.

147
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,666
You do need talent.
How many spirit seers

148
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,291
do you think there are now?

149
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,291
It's shocking how
few of us are around.

150
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,000
Only a small percentage
of the population

151
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,041
has the ability,
and fewer still go on

152
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,583
to become pro mages.

153
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,541
These days, there are
very few occupations that

154
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,750
have to be as
selective as this one.

155
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,000
Do you think I
have what it takes

156
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,041
to be a working mage, someday?

157
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,083
[OHTOMO] I don't know.

158
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,833
Becoming a professional
mage requires

159
