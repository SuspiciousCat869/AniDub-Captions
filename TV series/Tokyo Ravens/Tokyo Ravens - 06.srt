1
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,625
Wait! What if
someone sees us?

2
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:34,791
You have to stop that.

3
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,833
Please, stop!

4
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:38,958
Basically, Harutora
started living in the dorms

5
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:41,333
with Touji so Natsume
decided to move in there, too,

6
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,708
so they could be
closer together!

7
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:44,500
The situation has
turned into a passionate,

8
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,833
heart-pounding love triangle,
and I can't get enough!

9
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:47,916
Isn't it exciting?

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,416
I can't take it;
how will this thing end?

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,125
You know, if you're
going to be a dorm mother,

12
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:52,958
the boys' dorm
is the way to go!

13
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:55,666
Come on. That can't
be, like, for real.

14
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,333
Making things up again, Mako?

15
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:58,791
[FUJINO]
I'm completely serious!

16
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,916
Right now, the boys' dorm
is like a real-life fantasy,

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,916
and I love it!

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,625
They're the best show ever!

19
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:06,166
Anything could
happen at this point.

20
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,541
[KIFU] Hm?

21
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:12,125
[FUJINO and KIFU] A-Ah!

22
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:13,583
[HARUTORA]
Stop moving around!

23
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:17,416
C'mon! Can we at least get
out of the freakin' hallway?

24
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,958
Did I not say
it was a fantasy?

25
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:20,541
This is so scandalous!

26
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,791
No! No pictures; this
isn't what it looks like!

27
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,125
Yeah. Sure, whatever you say.

28
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:27,500
I'm Ako, the dorm mother
for the girls' dorm.

29
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,583
It's great to finally
meet you, Harutora.

30
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:32,125
I've heard so many stories
about you from Mako.

31
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:33,791
So, so, many stories!

32
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:36,666
[HARUTORA] Maybe introduce
yourself before going paparazzi!

33
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,875
And delete the pictures
you already took!

34
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,000
What's with
the racket?

35
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,125
For real!

36
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,625
[HARUTORA] U-Uhh...

37
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,166
[FEMALE STUDENTS] Ahhhh!

38
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,708
[FEMALE STUDENT 6A]
OMG, wait till the other girls

39
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:48,083
hear about this!

40
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:51,291
[HARUTORA] Hey, wait.
It's not like that!

41
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:52,875
Ohh...

42
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,041
[TOUJI] Let me
get this straight;

43
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,125
Natsume made a familiar to
use the public bathrooms,

44
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,458
but it malfunctioned.

45
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,333
Harutora caught it,
but other people showed up

46
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,208
and saw you in a rather
compromising situation?

47
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,625
[HARUTORA] Mm-hmm.

48
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:35,916
Well, that explains a lot.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,708
I was wondering why
everyone's acting like

50
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,291
our table had the plague.

51
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,916
[BOYS chatter]

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,791
[HARUTORA sighs]

53
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,291
This is so humiliating.

54
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:46,708
[footsteps]
[HARUTORA] Hm?

55
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,791
[FUJINO hums]

56
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,166
[inaudible]

57
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,541
[FUJINO whispers]
Don't worry!

58
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,750
[FUJINO giggles]

59
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,916
Oh, perfect, I bet
she's including me

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,250
in her twisted
little fantasy.

61
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,333
Probably.

62
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:01,000
Man. Well, now this
isn't funny anymore.

63
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,458
Look, you're playing
with fire here.

64
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:03,875
Dressing like
a guy's one thing,

65
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,125
but living in a boys'
dorm is too much.

66
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,875
Whatever; the plan
itself was perfect.

67
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,041
I just needed
someone to see me.

68
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,333
No one would
doubt I was a boy

69
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,416
if that familiar had
been seen without clothes.

70
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,000
I guess technically
your plan worked,

71
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,583
so congrats on that.

72
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,250
[KON] How inappropriate.

73
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,166
No one asked you, Kon!

74
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,625
You shouldn't butt in when
you haven't been summoned!

75
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,125
U-Um...

76
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,750
Anyway, we can't
change what happened.

77
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,291
We'll just have to try to
forget the whole thing.

78
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,333
[HARUTORA]
She's full of it.

79
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,750
[TOUJI]
Totally full of it.

80
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,791
[TOUJI] Shopping?
Tomorrow?

81
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,125
[HARUTORA] Yeah.

82
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,375
All I've done since I got
here is freaking study.

83
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,916
[NATSUME]
And even then,

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,958
you still haven't been able
to keep up with classwork.

85
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,958
I don't care!
I just need a break!

86
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,166
I can't take it anymore!
Ever since I left home,

87
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,666
all I've done is go
back and forth between

88
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,166
dorm and school, dorm and
school, dorm and school!

89
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,666
[NATSUME] So that's
what this is about.

90
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,166
You know, it's okay
to relax a little

91
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,583
every once in a while!

00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,875
Sorry, dude. I already
have plans tomorrow.

How do you
have plans?

94

Why don't you
two go together?

95
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,291
It'll be fun.

96
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,416
Guess we might as well.

How about it, Natsume?
Shopping tomorrow?

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,791
You mean like a--

[HARUTORA] Huh?

[NATSUME] A date?

[HARUTORA]
What's wrong?

102
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,666
You're face is
getting really red.

No, it's not. I'm fine.

104

I'm gonna die.

105
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,416
I can't handle
all this suspense.

wrong with you?

Yeah, so what.

What have you been
doing until now?

[NATSUME] All I've needed so
far was this and some sweats.

114
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,083
The only places I ever go

115
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,375
are the convenience store
and the mall anyway.

116
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,375
Wow. That's kinda pathetic.

117
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,541

are calling me pathetic?

[NATSUME] I don't
need your help, okay?

Yes, you do; someone's
gotta tell you what's cool.

This is so embarrassing.

[HARUTORA] Whoa.
There are so many people here!

124

What? Ya-Shibu?

Why are you saying
Shibuya like that?

127

Because it's not at all
pronounced that way.

00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,166
But Touji said
the slang is to say

It hasn't been that long!

the fireworks festival together.

00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,708
Where do you want
to go shopping?

162
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,583
[HARUTORA] I'd like to
check out second-hand stores.

163
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,083
That's all I can afford,

164
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,250
but it kinda feels good
just to get outside

165
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,583
and walk around a little while.

166
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,083
That's true.
This is pretty nice.

167
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:33,000
And it totally feels
like we're on a date!

168
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,666
[HARUTORA] So clothes
first, right?

169
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,708
You can be in charge of
deciding where we're gonna go.

170
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,208
In charge? Like, how?

171
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,458
I'm new here.

172
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,000
I don't know where the
second-hand stores are.

173
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,750
Just guide us to
the general area.

174
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,291
There's no way! I can't!

175
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,458
The only place I've ever bought
clothes before is online.

176
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,083
You mean girls'
clothes, too?

177
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,583
I just don't like
how at the store

178
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,583
all the people that
work there talk to you.

179
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,375
Wait, seriously?

180
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,375
Well, I can go ask
someone for help.

181
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,750
No, it's fine!

182
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,500
Why don't we just look
around on our own for a bit?

183
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,791
Wow, I guess I should've
waited for Touji after all.

184
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,708
[NATSUME] You're the one
that invited me, Harutora!

185
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,666
A proper escort would have
looked up places to go first!

186
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,958
And it's not my
fault you don't know

187
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,250
how to plan something
ahead of time!

188
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,500
Why are you upset?

189
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:21,625
What? I'm not upset
in the least, you dummy!

190
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:22,916
Uh. "You dummy"?

191
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,500
What are you, in the
first grade or something?

192
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,000
[NATSUME] Don't you dare
talk to me like that!

193
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,250
Don't forget,
you're my familiar.

194
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,250
I see.

195
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,666
So even though
I'm new to the city,

196
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,291
I should navigate for my master
who never goes outside.

197
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,625
[NATSUME] Fine. I'll take
you to your stupid store!

198
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,291
[HARUTORA] Hey!

199
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,750
They don't sell second-hand
stuff in a department store!

200
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,583
Oh, come on.
It's almost three o'clock.

201
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,125
I'm starving.

202
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,500
[NATSUME]
Clothes first, right?

203
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,791
We can eat lunch after that.

204
00:08:56,875 --> 00:09:00,208
Aw. There goes my
precious Sunday.

205
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,291
[HARUTORA] No, wait.

206
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,375
I didn't mean it
like that, Natsume!

207
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,791
[HARUTORA] Huh?

208
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,333
Natsume! Stop!

209
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,958
Don't touch me, Harutora!
I'm not ready to give up!

210
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,916
That's not it!
We shouldn't be here!

211
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,583
Whaddaya mean
"shouldn't be here"?

212
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,208
I mean, look around!

213
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,583
[NATSUME] Huh?

214
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,833
[NATSUME gasps]

215
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,333
Those are love hotels.

216
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,250
Oh no.

217
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,666
I'm shocked you
know about 'em.

218
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,833
Come here often?

219
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:39,208
I didn't-- That's not what--

220
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,208
This is not what
I was planning.

221
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:44,583
Yeah, of course not.
Just chill a bit, okay?

222
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,416
[NATSUME] Why?

223
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,375
Why what? Natsume?

224
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,916
Why did this happen?

225
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,875
We finally got to
go out together.

226
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,791
This is--This is awful.

227
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:02,125
[NATSUME cries]

228
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:05,125
And my luck strikes,
yet again.

229
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,250
Hey, don't cry.

230
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,250
I'm not crying, you dummy.

231
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,333
[HARUTORA sighs]

232
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,708
We need to go;

233
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,708
we can't risk anyone seeing
us in an area like this.

234
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,250
[FUJINO]
Ako, you spot 'em anywhere?

235
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,291
[HARUTORA gasps]

236
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,416
[KIFU] No, I haven't
seen anything.

237
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,875
Are you positive you did?

238
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,583
Like, Natsume and Harutora
were actually together?

239
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,291
Yeah. I swear it.
I saw them!

240
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,541
Those two are gonna
go all the way tonight!

241
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,750
As their dorm room mother,
I have to stop them, right?

242
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,125
[KIFU] Mm-hm.

243
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,541
I love it!

244
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,333
[HARUTORA] Crap.
Where should we go?

245
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,541
[FUJINO] This is so going
in my journal tonight!

246
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,541
[KIFU] Did you
bring the camera?

247
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:45,666
[FUJINO and KIFU 
chatter indistinctly]

248
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,166
What's a girl gotta
do to catch some

249
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,041
high school boys
about to get it on?

250
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,791
[HARUTORA]
This was an emergency.

251
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,125
[NATSUME]
Definitely an emergency.

252
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,166
Well, that was a
close one, wasn't it?

253
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,708
Yes. Definitely
a close one.

254
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,375
Well, since we're here,

255
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,916
might as well rest until
it stops raining, right?

256
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,458
Luckily, there's TV.

257
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,083
Here.

258
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,625
[PORN GIRL moans]

259
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,333
[NATSUME] Aahh!

260
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,166
[HARUTORA] Sorry.

261
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,583
[NATSUME]
It's all right.

262
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,041
I'm sorry.

263
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,208
You went through all
the trouble to invite me,

264
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:32,416
but my weird pride
messed everything up.

265
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,125
[HARUTORA]
Don't worry about it!

266
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,208
None of this is
your fault, y'know?

267
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:39,041
You just got caught up in a
streak of my usual stellar luck.

268
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,208
[NATSUME]
That's not true!

269
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,666
Hey, at least we get to
have a little adventure.

270
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,291
I wouldn't mind Sundays like
this, without the hotels.

271
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,708
Do you really mean-- Achoo!

272
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,166
[HARUTORA] Oh hey!

273
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,208
I guess you got soaked out
there--you must be freezing.

274
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,541
Wanna take a warm shower?

275
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:54,458
[NATSUME] Huh?

276
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,000
Uh--Wait!

277
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,666
I wasn't asking
that in a dirty way.

278
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,333
I don't want you to
catch a cold; that's all.

279
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,583
It'd suck. I didn't have
any ulterior motives.

280
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,458
I was just worried, you know?

281
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,500
I know.
I understand.

282
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,708
[HARUTORA] Huh...?

283
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,708
If you say so, Harutora.

284
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,083
[NATSUME] If you
say so, Harutora.

285
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,333
I'll go take a shower.

286
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,083
Do you, uh--

287
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,583
[KON] Ahem.

288
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,250
[HARUTORA]
Kon, it's you!

289
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,625
Why do you have to
freak me out like that?

290
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,500
I'm sorry;
no freak out intended.

291
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,041
An incident has occurred that
I believe you should know about,

292
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,500
so I came as fast as I could
in order to tell you.

293
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:41,750
[HARUTORA] Mm-hmm.

294
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,125
[KON] Or would you
rather I not say anything

295
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,750
until the two of you are
finished here, as they say?

296
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,291
It's completely up to you.

297
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,666
No, uh-- What is it?

298
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,833
[KON] I'm always by
your side, as you know,

299
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,125
but if you'd rather, I could
wait until afterwards.

300
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,291
I'd hate to interrupt
whatever this is.

301
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,333
I just assumed
you'd prefer

302
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,208
to know something so vital.

303
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,791
Look, you've got
the wrong idea.

304
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,583
And you keep
showing up so suddenly.

305
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,916
Should I just expect
that to happen a lot?

306
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,541
[KON] Try to focus,
Master Harutora,

307
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,666
The enemy's familiars
are approaching.

308
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,083
Please be on your guard.

309
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,833
[KYOKO]
Are you for serious?

310
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,666
I find it a little
hard to believe.

311
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,083
Yeah, a love hotel
seems way extreme.

312
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,291
Well, once we find them,
we'll know whether it's true!

313
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,458
So keep searching!

314
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,208
We need to have solid proof!

315
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,708
So that we can, you know,

316
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,291
stop them from making
a terrible mistake.

317
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,125
I just went to the
dorms to see Natsume,

318
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,291
but he wasn't there.

319
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,000
See, don't you wanna
know the truth, too?

320
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,166
Tell me you've heard the
rumors about those boys.

321
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,583
Pretty scandalous.

322
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,250
They disappeared
around here!

323
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,333
Uh, maybe I don't get it,

324
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,375
but Harutora and
Natsume are both guys.

325
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:42,291
[FUJINO] Racist!

326
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,666
How can you say
things like that

327
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,625
in the gender-free world
we live in today?

328
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,166
Not to mention, Natsume
could be a freakin' model.

329
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,833
Boys that pretty send
shivers down my gaydar!

330
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,833
[KYOKO] Wait. I, for one,
don't believe it!

331
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,750
I mean no judgment, but still.

332
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,083
[KIFU] Calm down, Kyoko;
whether you believe it or not,

333
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,083
don't you think we should
find out the truth?

334
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:01,166
[KYOKO] Fine, count me in.

335
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,458
Natsume is innocent,
and I'm going to prove it.

336
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,125
I'll search this whole
city until I find them!

337
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,375
So they're out to get you.

338
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:09,791
How did those two
perverts end up

339
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,166
as our dorm mothers?

340
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,875
Crap, if they find us,
we're gonna be

341
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:15,666
stuck with a label
we'll never get rid of.

342
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,541
[NATSUME]
Don't worry, Harutora.

343
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,083
Sure, Kyoko certainly
knows what she's doing.

344
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:23,333
And, yes, Tenma does know his
way around simple familiars.

345
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,750
But fortunately for us,

346
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,500
none of that stuff
really matters.

347
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,750
Neither can compete with me.

348
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:32,041
I can take care of both
their familiars by myself!

349
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,708
You're the awesomest ever.

350
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,458
[KON] Oh, don't get
ahead of the story.

351
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,375
There's still more to report.

352
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,208
[OHTOMO] What are
you all doing here?

353
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,291
[KYOKO] Um...

354
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,875
[TENMA] Hey there,
Mister Ohtomo!

355
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,125
[FUJINO and KIFU] Oh my!

356
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,875
[KYOKO] You tell us first.
Why are you here?

357
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,666
Oh, nothing major;
just here on a little errand.

358
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,166
Huh?

359
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,500
Well, it's interesting you
should show up, Mister Ohtomo!

360
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,208
[OHTOMO] 
Miss Fujino? Miss Kifu?

361
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,208
What's going on?

362
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,541
You're never gonna
believe this.

363
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,250
[OHTOMO] I understand.

364
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:01,291
But even simple familiars are
still familiars, you know.

365
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,791
They are not to
be played with.

366
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,958
They should be used
by professionals.

367
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,458
Yes, students are exempt
from this in school,

368
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,666
but that doesn't
mean I can allow

369
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,375
amateurs to hunt their
comrades with magic.

370
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,625
Oh, come on,
let them do it!

371
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,583
Well, I guess that
does make sense.

372
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,541
On the other hand, I, Ohtomo,

373
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:21,083
will take care of this matter
for everyone invested instead.

374
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,791
Does that work for you?

375
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,125
It'll be a blast! 

376
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,125
I haven't used my true
power in such a long time!

377
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,416
Yes, please!

378
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,416
For real,
Mister Ohtomo?

379
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,000
You'll really help us?

380
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,083
[OHTOMO] I never go back
on my word and I promise

381
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,833
to uncover this scintillating--

382
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,666
I mean, inappropriate activity
roiling in our midst.

383
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,250
Yes, it's on, now.

384
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,458
I'll learn the truth and
expose them to the light of day

385
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:41,666
any way I must!

386
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,958
[KYOKO] Why would
you expose them?

387
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,916
[TENMA] I think everybody
needs to calm down!

388
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,125
[OHTOMO] Go!

389
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,625
So, yeah, they're
out to get you.

390
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:51,791
Are you kidding me?

391
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,458
Nothing about that creepy
teacher is okay!

392
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,125
Natsume, you can
take him, right?

393
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,250
Tell me that fishy teacher
ain't got nothin' on you.

394
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,625
--Please!
--[NATSUME] Produce Barrier.

395
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,833
Are you listening to me?
What are you even doing?

396
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,500
I'm trying to
put up a barrier!

397
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:03,708
Kon, you're so stupid.

398
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,250
You should have said
the Ohtomo part first!

399
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,833
[HARUTORA] So you're
saying we're in trouble?

400
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,166
Of course we are, yes!

401
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,250
He may be a teacher, but
he's still a professional.

402
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:13,750
And it's just--I have no idea
what his tactics will be.

403
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,083
Bottom line: there's no way
I can fight him head on.

404
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,208
[HARUTORA whimpers]

405
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,791
Listen, Harutora.
The road from now on?

406
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,416
It's going to be long
and so much harder.

407
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,666
I hope that...

408
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,250
I hope that we can stay
friends after this.

409
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,041
Okay, what is the
deal with you?

410
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,958
You need to get
a hold of yourself.

411
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:34,333
Pull it together, girl,
you're our only hope!

412
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,166
[NATSUME] I had a good run
as a prep school student.

413
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,500
[HARUTORA] You are
creeping me out.

414
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,916
[phone rings]

415
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,041
Hey, what's
with the party?

416
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,583
Why are you guys
hanging out here?

417
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,583
[OHTOMO] Hello, Touji;
care to join us?

418
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,250
Wait, what the--?

419
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,291
[FUJINO] Natsume?

420
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,125
We thought you
were with Harutora!

421
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,291
Yeah, I was.

422
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,375
We were together until
around lunch time.

423
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,125
But I had plans with
Touji after that,

424
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,625
so we went our separate ways.

425
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,375
But--we thought that--

426
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,375
Well, this is awkward.

427
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,916
[GIRLS] U-Uhh...

428
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,250
[whispers]
Thanks.

429
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,916
So, I'm done with what
I had to take care of.

430
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,875
What's going on with you guys?

431
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,916
[HARUTORA]
Please, help us!

432
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,750
[whispers]
You saved our butts, Touji.

433
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,416
Hey, so that hotel
you guys ran into?

434
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,458
You know it was just a
regular business hotel?

435
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,250
[NATSUME] What?

436
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,750
[TOUJI] Heh. Now, what was
with all of you out here?

437
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,833
The hotel district is kind of
a strange place to hang out.

438
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,875
Yeah, we were just,
you know, kinda--

439
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,166
Oh, nothing.

440
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,666
[HARUTORA]
Natsume! Touji!

441
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,416
[FUJINO]
Now Harutora's here!

442
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,625
[HARUTORA] Yeah, so?

443
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,708
Why is everyone standing
around here, anyway?

444
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,791
Kay. Something
weird is going on.

445
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,166
Yeah, like totally weird.

446
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,291
I know for sure
we saw those two.

447
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,125
[HARUTORA chuckles]

448
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,833
[KON]
Wait, Master Harutora!

449
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,125
You forgot something, sir!

450
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,583
[HARUTORA] Hey,
where did I leave that?

451
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,541
[KON] It was in
the hotel earlier.

452
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,166
I found it on the bed
under the bath towel.

453
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,083
Oh, right. Thanks for
bringing it to me.

454
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,916
[FUJINO]
What? Wait!

455
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,375
It was in the hotel?

456
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,791
And on the bed?

457
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,041
Under the bath towel,
like really?

458
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:15,875
Oh, crap!

459
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,125
[KON] Huh?

460
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,625
No. That poor
little fox girl.

461
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,166
And she's his familiar, too!

462
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,000
This is quite
disturbing, Harutora.

463
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,208
Seriously, man.

464
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,041
I mean, she is
just a little girl.

465
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,833
You pervert!

466
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:31,791
Oh, come on!
It's a misunderstanding!

467
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,791
Natsume, will you
please explain?

468
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,750
How can I do that
when I was with Touji?

469
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,416
[HARUTORA]
Don't just abandon me!

470
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,000
Dude, Touji! You can
at least look at me!

471
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,583
[KON] Master Harutora.

472
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,500
I'm so so sorry;

473
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,416
I g-guess I should have ke-kept
quiet about this matter, sir.

474
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,916
You're not helping me here!

475
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,750
[GROUP] It's true?

476
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:50,916
[HARUTORA] Uhh...

477
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,666
[KON] Please, oh,
please forgive me, sir.

478
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,041
I swear to you; I will ke-keep
everything else a se-secret!

479
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,625
Just please don't get
angry with me again!

480
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,125
Please, Kon. I need you
to tell them the truth!

481
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,125
Kon. Oh, come on!

482
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,625
[KIFU] Everything else?

483
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,333
[FUJINO] No. I don't
want to hear anymore.

484
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,333
[HARUTORA]
Please, believe me;

485
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,708
it's all a misunderstanding!

486
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,416
[OHTOMO] Oh?

487
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,333
Found him already?

488
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:23,541
[MAGIC INVESTIGATOR 4A]
Why is this happening?

489
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,250
When they come for me,
what am I supposed to tell them?

490
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,416
[DOMAN] If you'd like,

491
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,916
I can tell you about
your previous life.

492
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
[OHTOMO] Oh, dear me.

493
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,541
Aahh!

494
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,166
[OHTOMO] Someone worked hard
on their day off, didn't they?

495
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,791
Who are you?

496
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,291
[MAGIC INVESTIGATOR 4A]
I can't move.

497
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,916
It's an immobilizing spell.

498
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,458
[OHTOMO] The quality
of investigators

499
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,666
has really gone downhill.

500
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,333
Then again, perhaps this
just means that the mages

501
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:54,250
in the Exorcism Bureau are that
much better, don't you think?

502
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,583
[MIYO] Working overtime,
Mister Ohtomo?

503
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:57,791
[OHTOMO]
Well, hello there.

504
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,541
I take it this
isn't news to you?

505
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:02,541
[MIYO] I try to stay informed
when it comes to my students.

506
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,500
Seems to me you took a
rather significant risk

507
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,583
with our charges, Principal.

508
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,791
Why leave this idiot alone
even though you knew

509
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:12,500
a long time ago he was
actually a Yakou devotee?

510
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,291
[MIYO] We had confirmed
his connection to

511
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:17,166
the Twin Horn Syndicate
before the incident.

512
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,583
Unfortunately, we did
not know anything else.

513
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:21,958
By any chance,
do you think you can

514
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,208
wrangle me some
holiday pay for this?

515
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,750
[MIYO] Oh, but it's
for our dear students.

516
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,958
Surely money isn't
an issue to you.

517
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:34,166
Money is always an issue,
but I suppose it hardly matters.

518
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,916
If it goes down like
we think it will,

519
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,500
a little overtime won't
exactly make a difference.

520
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,041
Now we just wait to
see if they bother

521
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,625
showing their hand
for this moron.

522
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,541
[DOMAN]
So, he's been found out?

523
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,708
No matter; that
fool investigator

524
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,125
was a constant
disappointment anyway.

525
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,166
[KAKUGYOUKI] I just wish you'd
stop having to use my name

526
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,791
in order to scare everyone.

527
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:58,041
So now what?
Take it easy for a while?

528
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,333
You're not concerned
about our cover?

529
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:03,166
Nah, it's not something I'd go
through the trouble to confirm.

530
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,041
I'm not much like
Hishamaru in that way.

531
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,750
[DOMAN] Hmph. Sometimes I think
you're too indifferent

532
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,916
about your own ogre spirit.

533
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,625
Thanks to you, I was
spotted by that young one.

534
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,041
[KAKUGYOUKI]
Oh yeah, right, him.

535
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,375
He seems like he comes
from some decent stock.

536
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:19,958
I take it you know him?

537
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,250
[DOMAN]
We did meet once.

538
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,041
He was extraordinarily impudent

539
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:27,125
and somehow managed
to escape my grasp.

540
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,708
But it cost him a leg
in the process.

541
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,958
He sounds
interesting to me.

542
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,416
But, either way,

543
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,625
the head of Onmyo Prep is
a pretty capable astrologer.

544
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,500
Aren't you a little concerned
she may have already

545
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,000
seen through your plans?

546
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:43,125
Oh, half the fun lies in
trying to outwit that old woman.

547
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,416
Yeah, well I have
no comment

548
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,291
when it comes to
your nasty hobbies.

549
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,166
That's really all I wanted.

550
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,125
Oh, wait, one more thing.

551
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,875
[DOMAN] Hm?

552
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,041
Do we know what
that kid is, yet?

553
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,208
[DOMAN] Only that he's
from a branch family.

554
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:59,166
The dragon and tiger
have both appeared.

555
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,583
I have to say,

556
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,875
that poor tiger is still
looking pretty shabby, though.

557
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,541
Why do you ask; did he
do something interesting?

558
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,125
[KAKUGYOUKI] No, not really.

559
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,916
Nothing you need
to mess with anyway.

560
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,166
[DOMAN]
Now, now, my friend.

561
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,291
Did you not just tell
me you had no comment

562
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,125
when it came to
my nasty hobbies?

563
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,833
[KAKUGYOUKI] You haven't
changed one bit.

564
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:29,583
[inaudible]

565
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:32,416
[KAKUGYOUKI]
You always were focused.

566
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,958
[FUJINO]
It's a real-life fantasy!

567
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:10,541
[KIFU] Romance!

568
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:10,958
[FUJINO] Scandal!
