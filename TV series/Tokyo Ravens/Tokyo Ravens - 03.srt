1
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,958
[HARUTORA] Crazy...

2
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:45,416
There's spirit
energy everywhere.

3
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,041
[HARUTORA] Hokuto...

4
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:54,083
I never had what it
took to be a mage...

5
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:56,041
But that's all changed now.

6
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:57,291
I'll do this...

7
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,208
For you.

8
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,958
[NATSUME]
Forward, Yukikaze!

9
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:03,291
[neighs]

10
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,291
[SUZUKA]
Not long now...

11
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,833
Have patience, brother...

12
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,458
I'll bring you back soon.

13
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,791
[SUZUKA]
We have company.

14
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,041
I see her!

15
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,583
[roars]

16
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,208
An armored demon?!

17
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,333
We have to find a way
to get through!

18
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,458
Yeah, I know...

19
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,500
But for now, maybe
we should just land.

20
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:47,625
[NATSUME] Right!

21
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,166
Here we go.

22
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,583
All right,
take us back up!

23
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:12,791
'Kay!

24
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,375
Suzuka!
This is a mistake!

25
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,416
Please! Stop!

26
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,583
It would only be a mistake

27
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,541
if I didn't know
what I was doing!

28
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,750
You know I'm strong
enough for this spell!

29
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,375
[NATSUME] Listen!
You can't control it!

30
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,666
In the end, you're
committing suicide!

31
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,083
[HARUTORA] Natsume!

32
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:33,000
All spells dealing with
souls are forbidden...

33
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:36,208
It is a form of magic
we should not meddle in.

34
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:37,833
That incantation...

35
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,583
It's a relic of a bygone era,

36
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,958
when people blindly
followed religion.

37
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,375
It's not to be
taken lightly...

38
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,500
You can't just go through
the motions with no faith.

39
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,958
I'm not the first to try
and revive this ritual...

40
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,750
The great Tsuchimikados
beat me to the punch...

41
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,958
I won't let your double
standards get in the way

42
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,208
of my success!

43
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,333
Now mind your own business!

44
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:00,625
Here comes another one!

45
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,791
Take us down, Yukikaze.

46
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,583
Uh!

47
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,375
Pincer attack!
That's bad news...

48
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,125
Dude, this sword
is incredible!

49
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,500
[NATSUME]
It's a defensive sword...

50
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,166
An antique specially forged,

51
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,666
and passed down
through the years.

52
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,708
Well that hit I just
blocked left a mark in it.

53
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,583
What?

54
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,208
[NATSUME whimpers]

55
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,583
No but hey, look.
You can barely even see it...

56
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,500
Oh just don't
worry about it,

57
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,166
now is so not the time.

58
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,416
[HARUTORA] It might help
if you fought too!

59
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,041
Gimme a break! Can't you
see I'm busy steering?

60
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,250
[HARUTORA] She's even
more nervous than I am!

61
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:08,458
[loud thuds]

62
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,166
Oh no...
The ritual has begun!

63
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,375
Heads up!

64
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,041
Yukikaze!

65
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,250
[HARUTORA gasps]

66
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,958
Harutora, no!

67
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,916
[HARUTORA] Aaaahhh!

68
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,625
[NATSUME gasps]

69
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,916
Please help him, Hokuto!

70
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,583
[HARUTORA yells]

71
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,458
Wait...
What'd you say...?

72
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,333
Did you call it Hokuto?

73
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,333
Natsume!
We have a dragon?!

74
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,083
[NATSUME] Of course
we have a dragon!

75
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:59,125
Hokuto has been a Tsuchimikado
guardian for generations;

76
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,708
she's practically
a family heirloom.

77
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,958
We're Onmyo mages,
remember?

78
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,000
[HARUTORA] And why weren't
we using her from the start?

79
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,625
[NATSUME] Well, she's not
completely under my control...

80
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,791
[HARUTORA] I can tell.
She's not freaking out.

81
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,416
[NATSUME]
Hokuto, listen...

82
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,541
I order you to defeat
the enemy familiar!

83
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,875
[HARUTORA yells]

84
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,833
[roars]

85
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,416
[HARUTORA] Crap...
I'm going to fall off!

86
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,541
Harutora, you're gonna
have to jump over to me!

87
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,833
[HARUTORA] Seriously?
That's crazy talk!

88
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,708
Aaaahhh!

89
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,791
[HARUTORA yells]

90
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:37,833
[NATSUME]
Got you...!

91
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,916
Just hold on!

92
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,333
[NATSUME]
Please be all right...

93
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,375
Are you hurt at all?!

94
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:27,500
[HARUTORA]
I'm fine, Natsume...

95
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:28,625
Calm down!

96
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,666
Seriously...
You can let go, already.

97
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,500
So listen, you think
the defensive sword

98
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,791
could be used for attacks...?

99
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,333
Huh?

100
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,208
[NATSUME] Sure...
I can try.

101
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Nomak Samanta-buddhanam...

102
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,708
Indoraya sowaka!

103
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,958
[NATSUME] When we remove the
seal from the defensive sword...

104
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,708
It is imbued with the power
of the mighty Sakra...

105
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,166
Then it becomes
an enemy destroyer.

106
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,833
Awesome.

107
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,250
Now that you're
properly armed,

108
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,416
hand me that bow.

109
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,541
Sure thing, but...
No arrows...

110
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:04,875
I won't need them...

111
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,333
This is a peach bow,
infused with magical energy.

112
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,375
Trust me, it will
get the job done.

113
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,416
All right, then.

114
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,750
I'll create some
kind of distraction,

115
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,291
and you'll go stop
the ritual, okay?

116
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,875
I think that's a good idea...

117
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,458
But you're the familiar here,

118
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,208
so don't you think I should
be the one giving the orders?

119
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,958
Whatever...

120
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:22,958
Let's go!

121
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,041
Okay!

122
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:43,291
[HARUTORA yells]
Aaaahhhhhhhh...!

123
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,791
Well done, you got him!

124
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,041
Not yet!

125
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,958
[HARUTORA grunts]

126
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:14,875
No! Watch out!

127
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,583
[HARUTORA grunts]

128
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,625
[HARUTORA yells]
Aaaahhhhhhhh!

129
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,333
Natsume!

130
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,583
[NATSUME] Got it!

131
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,416
[NATSUME]
The barrier has fallen.

132
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,833
We need to make our move!

133
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,250
[HARUTORA]
Right on! Let's go!

134
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,416
[NATSUME] Kay!

135
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,875
I guess he's not done!

136
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,083
[HARUTORA]
That's what I'm talkin' about!

137
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,500
Having a dragon on
your side has its perks.

138
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,125
I think it's time to end this.

139
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,833
Absolutely.

140
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,625
It's not over yet.

141
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,333
[NATSUME screams]

142
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,375
[HARUTORA] The talismans...

143
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,541
[NATSUME]
They're pinning me down!

144
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,416
Wait...

145
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,375
She made all of these...

146
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,375
...with her own blood?

147
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:53,583
I am Onmyo mage
Suzuka Dairenji...

148
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,541
In humble supplication,
I offer myself as sacrifice

149
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,750
to the Taizan Fukun
god of the afterlife.

150
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,875
Uh... Natsume...?
What's that?

151
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,375
I'm not really sure...

152
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:39,916
But... Whatever it is,
it's definitely not a god.

153
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,333
Can you hear me,
brother...?

154
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,458
Please.

155
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:12,250
[SUZUKA] You came back!

156
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,833
Where... am I?

157
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:22,208
[SUZUKA laughs]

158
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,916
[SUZUKA] I'm so glad
you've come back to me,

159
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,333
Big Brother!
[blow lands]

160
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,208
Heh. It's not enough.

161
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,458
[TOSHIYA] Suzuka...

162
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:41,000
Look, I made a new
friend just for you!

163
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,250
[SUZUKA laughs]

164
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,791
I love them, thank you!

165
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,625
Brother?

166
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,333
[TOSHIYA]
It's not enough...

167
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,666
[SUZUKA chokes]

168
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,166
[TOSHIYA] It's not enough...

169
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,500
It's not enough...

170
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:08,416
It'll never be enough, Suzuka!

171
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,083
[SUZUKA]
No, stop... Brother...

172
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,125
Please, just wait...

173
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,875
I'll give my life...

174
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,291
I'll...

175
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,250
I'll give... my life...

176
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,750
...for you, just...
Just please...

177
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,875
let me be... with you...

178
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:26,500
for a little while... longer.

179
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,625
[HARUTORA] It was her...

180
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:34,375
Hokuto is dead because of her...

181
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,166
She deserves this...

182
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,083
Right?

183
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:41,333
No please...
Brother...

184
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,791
All right...
That's enough!

185
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,000
[NATSUME]
What are you doing?

186
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:52,791
You stupid brat...!
I said that's enough!

187
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:01,416
[HARUTORA yells]
Aaaahhhhhhhh...!

188
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,666
Natsume!

189
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,625
Burn these
talismans to ash!

190
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,041
Order!

191
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,125
Nice work...
Now... Let's go!

192
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,000
[HARUTORA]
A spirit pulse...?

193
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,791
I see...

194
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,458
It's acting like the
strings on a marionette...

195
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,750
[HARUTORA] Come on!

196
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,791
Aaaahhhhhhhh!

197
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,333
Harutora! No!

198
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,583
[HARUTORA yells]
Aaaahhhhhhhh...!

199
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,000
[HARUTORA]
Now do your thing...

200
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,333
Blood of the Tsuchimikado clan!

201
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,166
[HISHAMARU]
So that's that...?

202
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,208
Is there nothing that
will change your mind?

203
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,375
[YAKOU] Nothing...

204
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,750
Please forgive me.

205
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,041
[HISHAMARU] I'll keep
waiting for you...

206
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:31,083
Until time itself
stands still...

207
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,750
I am yours to command,
after all...

208
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,583
Master Yakou.

209
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:40,333
[NATSUME] Ban! Un!
Taraku! Kiriku! Aku!

210
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,916
Chain of Elements...!

211
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,416
Order!

212
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,250
[NATSUME]
Stop staring at it...!

213
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,083
If you keep looking
into the void,

214
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,291
you could lose your soul!

215
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:14,958
Is it... over?

216
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,500
[NATSUME] Yes, I think so.

217
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,666
[SUZUKA]
It's not fair...

218
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,625
It's not...

219
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,458
Why wasn't it me?

220
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,166
Yukikaze...

221
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,750
I think we're finished for now.

222
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,875
[SUZUKA] Just kill me
and be done with it...

223
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,916
I murdered your friend, right?

224
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,458
So kill me.

225
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,708
[HARUTORA] Don't say
things like that...

226
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:55,916
If you died now, there'd be
no one to mourn your brother.

227
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,708
[SUZUKA cries]

228
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,125
[roars]

229
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:22,083
Rest in peace... Hokuto.

230
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,250
[NATSUME] That talisman...

231
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:28,083
Hey, is this something
you could fix?

232
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,041
I'm afraid not.

233
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,958
The spirit it once
held has gone...

234
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,375
However...

235
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,708
Whoever you're calling 'Hokuto'
may still be out there.

236
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,458
Or maybe not.
Who knows?

237
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,083
Wait...
What does that mean?

238
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,583
This is a manipulation
type familiar...

239
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,541
Which means the
'Hokuto' personality

240
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,125
you interacted with
was actually a mage...

241
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,250
And that mage is
probably still around.

242
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,250
[HARUTORA] What...?

243
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,333
Who would do
something like that?

244
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,541
I suppose somebody out there
was watching over you.

245
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,125
You'd know better than me...

246
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,708
Yeah, right...

247
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,541
How was I supposed to know that
my friend was just a familiar?

248
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,000
[HARUTORA] I'm sorry.

249
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,250
No, I'm sorry...

250
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,208
I hid the truth...
and tricked you.

251
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,916
[HARUTORA] I wonder...

252
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,541
Maybe someday...
I'll see her again...

253
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,250
I hope so.

254
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:22,041
[NATSUME] Yes...
Maybe you will.

255
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,375
[TOUJI] Man, that storm
was totally nuts!

256
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,750
[HARUTORA] Yeah.

257
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,875
But seriously dude...?

258
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,666
The Hokuto thing is wilder.

259
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,791
So how come you're
so chill about it?

260
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,125
I always had a
feeling there was

261
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,958
something strange
about that girl, bro...

262
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:43,791
Especially when it came to her
weird little obsession for you.

263
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:44,958
But if she was a familiar,

264
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,833
then who was
pulling her strings?

265
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:51,333
And why did she choose you
over awesomeness like me...?

266
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:54,250
That mystery may
never be solved.

267
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,083
[HARUTORA] Touji.

268
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,833
I've decided...

269
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:02,125
...that I should go to Tokyo.

270
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,791
[NATSUME] A familiar's
proper place will always be

271
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,458
at his master's side.

272
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:23,708
Therefore, I command you...

273
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,250
Enroll at Onmyo
Prep immediately!

274
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,583
The school accepted me...

275
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,250
because of my family or
the fight with Suzuka?

276
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,541
[sighs]

277
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,833
I guess it doesn't really
matter that much...

278
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,791
As long as I can be
there for Natsume.

279
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,833
[NATSUME] Stupid-tora!

280
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,500
Stupid-tora!

281
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,125
Crap, am I hearing
voices...?

282
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,666
[NATSUME] Hey...
Long time no see...

283
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,833
So, uh...

284
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,875
Sorry I wasn't here
when you arrived...

285
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,333
Been waiting long?

286
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,166
Wait... You're...

287
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,500
What the heck's going on?

288
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:55,541
[NATSUME]
Whaddaya mean...?

289
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,541
I just came to pick you up.

290
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,333
[HARUTORA] But why are you
talking like you're a guy?

291
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,166
And why are you
dressed like one?

292
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,291
It's a tradition of
the main house...

293
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,875
"The current heir to the
Tsuchimikado family...

294
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:12,000
must appear to be a man in
dealings with other clans."

295
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,250
The classes are fine
for the most part...

296
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,791
The tradition is a
little tricky, though.

297
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,750
Ohh kay...
Now I get it!

298
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,333
I'm glad we're on
the same page...

299
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,458
This is the way things
have got to be, okay...?

300
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,000
So deal with it.

301
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,166
So you're not who
you pretend to be.

302
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,583
You've just...
done what you had to.

303
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,583
So... You understand, then?

304
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,666
Thank you...

305
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,625
I was afraid you'd
be upset with me.

306
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,416
Nah...

307
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,625
You could've told me though.

308
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:43,208
Sorry...
I hid the truth...

309
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,958
...and tricked you.

310
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,791
Sorry.

311
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,625
Whoa... Aren't you
overreacting a little?

312
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,708
You didn't trick me;
I was just surprised.

313
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,291
Are we talking about
the same thing...?

314
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,458
Why'd you tell me you
got what I was saying?

315
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,625
Cross dressing is a family
tradition, that's all...

316
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,083
I mean isn't that what ya meant?

317
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,208
[NATSUME gasps]

318
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:05,791
[NATSUME] You didn't
get it at all...!

319
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,000
What is wrong with you?

320
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,875
Did your brain turn
into mush or something?

321
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:12,333
Okay, I'm lost...

322
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:13,958
Hey, I almost felt that...

323
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,208
[TOUJI]
Why am I not surprised?

324
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:18,416
You two are ridiculous,
you do know that, right?

325
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,541
[HARUTORA] Touji...!

326
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,541
You finished with
what you had to do?

327
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:24,041
Yeah... I just had to
check in on some friends.

328
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,958
Oh yeah. I'd like you to
meet my friend Natsume.

329
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,041
What is Touji
doing here?

330
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,458
What...? You mean that
you two've met already?

331
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:34,916
Touji decided to sign up
for Onmyo Prep with me.

332
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,083
Like seriously...?

333
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,500
He's an amateur, how'd
he even get accepted?

334
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:41,833
Are you for real?
Dude, I'm standing right here.

335
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:45,666
Yeah, I've been a seer ever
since the great spirit disaster.

336
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,791
You're a spirit seer...?

337
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,916
Then that means you knew...

338
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,208
I know the difference between
a familiar and a real person.

339
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,041
Pleased to meetcha
Natsume...

340
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:02,625
That's a very nice
ribbon you got there.

341
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,000
You know what, Chief...

342
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,041
The name 'Stupid-tora' kinda
sums you up, doesn't it?

343
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,166
What?

344
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,291
[NATSUME]
Aaagghh! Forget it!

345
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:11,208
You two have a lot
of catching up to do

346
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:12,625
if you want to
make it through...

347
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:14,708
Prepare yourselves!

348
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:17,708
[HARUTORA] Geez,
what's up with her?

349
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:19,375
Wow, sorry 'bout that...

350
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:22,166
I swear, she's usually
not like this at all.

351
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:25,000
I would say that's
exactly what she was like.

352
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:26,250
[TOUJI chuckles]

353
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,500
Wait...

354
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,250
Just what're
you staring at?

355
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:41,833
What...?
Nothing.

356
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:44,000
[NATSUME] Then get
moving, Stupid-tora!

357
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:46,625
Oh I'm sorry.
Whatever you say, Master.

358
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,833
[KON] It's finally
my turn to meet

359
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:09,500
Master Harutora in
next week's episode...!

360
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:10,916
Attack! Stab! Twist!
