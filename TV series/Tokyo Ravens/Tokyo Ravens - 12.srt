1
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,791
[HARUTORA] Man. I am super
stoked about this trip!

2
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:38,708
[NATSUME] Right? Training
camp, here we come! Heh.

3
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,041
I'm glad we
brought food!

4
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:41,666
[NATSUME] Mm.
These smell good!

5
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,708
Let's eat!

6
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:44,666
[TENMA]
Hey, what're you guys doing?

7
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,791
Dude. Munch time!

8
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:46,625
[TENMA] Huh?!

9
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:47,791
There's plenty
to share!

10
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,791
[TENMA] Uh, no,
I'm fine. Thanks.

11
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,000
[HARUTORA]
Hey. More for me!

12
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,750
Kids! Keep it
down back there.

13
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,791
This practical skills
training camp is classwork,

14
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:56,958
not a vacation.

15
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,541
We know, sir!

16
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,250
Look, guys, I'm not
trying to scare you,

17
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:02,708
but it's time you realize
there's hard work ahead.

18
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,583
If it's a choice
between your 'hard work'

19
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:06,250
and what we've been
dealing with lately,

20
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,916
I'll take your training
every single time.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,166
Plus: the snacks.

22
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,125
Yeah, that's right!
Way better than usual!

23
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:17,458
Sorry, I didn't mean to put
a damper on the drive for you.

24
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:20,458
Look, the two of you just
have fun while you still can.

25
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:23,875
[OHTOMO] Have fun
while you still can.

26
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,500
[HARUTORA and NATSUME] Huh?

27
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:26,583
That was weird.

28
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,291
Very.

29
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:29,750
Oh well!

30
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:30,875
[HARUTORA]
Seriously, though.

31
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,291
Training camp's got me psyched!

32
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:34,916
[NATSUME] I know! I'm totally
looking forward to it!

33
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,083
[KYOKO exhales]

34
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:15,208
Hey, when is that big lug
Touji joining us, anyway?

35
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,791
He's planning on
meeting us up here

36
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,875
after my dad's
finished examining him.

37
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,708
[TAKAHIRO] Looks to me like
the special training is working.

38
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:23,916
[TOUJI] Mm-hmm.

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,166
[HARUTORA] After what happened.

40
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,458
My dad said he had to
modify the seal in a way

41
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,083
that'll work better for Touji.

42
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,833
Really? Training after all
those heavy modifications?

43
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,833
That doesn't sound
like a good idea.

44
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,250
Actually, he thinks it's the
perfect time to try it out.

45
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,250
Long as Touji
takes it easy.

46
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,125
Wow.
Touji's tough.

47
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:44,083
I'd expect no
less from him.

48
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,000
In fact, I'd ask him for help.

49
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,291
My kinda day!

50
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:50,583
The bright blue sky.
Wind blowing in the trees.

51
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,875
This little nature hike is
gonna be our one way ticket

52
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,125
to relaxville. Know what
I'm talking about?

53
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,541
[NATSUME] Yeah, we can
train on our own time.

54
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,000
[HARUTORA]
Or do nothing at all!

55
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,875
[NATSUME and HARUTORA laugh]

56
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,125
Huh?

57
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:05,875
Heh.

58
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:09,208
Goodness! What took you
two slowpokes so long?

59
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,708
[NATSUME and HARUTORA]
U-U-Uhhhhhh...

60
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,833
I believe everyone has already
met Miss Suzuka Dairenji,

61
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,375
who will be joining us
on our training maneuvers.

62
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,750
So then.
Let's be nice, class.

63
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,750
I'm sure we'll
get along just fine!

64
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,875
Won't we?

65
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:29,500
[STUDENTS murmur]

66
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,291
[STUDENTS] Aahh!

67
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,625
Trying to make curry
with simple familiars

68
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:40,958
is harder than you'd think.

69
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,291
Much harder.

70
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,791
[KON]
M-Master Harutora!

71
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,958
You can do it!

72
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,833
So, uh. Do you
think you can make

73
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,666
the fire a little
bit stronger, maybe?

74
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah, sure.

75
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,916
[HARUTORA grunts]

76
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,750
[yelling]

77
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,583
[TENMA]
Too much! Too much!

78
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,583
[HARUTORA] Hot! Hot!

79
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,791
[NATSUME groans]

80
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:09,916
[TENMA] Water!
We need water!

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,833
[HARUTORA] Liquidate!

82
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,375
[TENMA] Aahh!

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,250
[NATSUME]
Hot, hot, hot ouch hot!

84
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:31,166
Owie!

85
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,958
[STUDENTS murmur]

86
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,500
[TENMA] Mm!

87
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,083
I never thought I'd say it,
but this is entirely edible!

88
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,583
Better than I
expected, anyway!

89
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,458
Natsume did a
really great job,

90
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,875
and Kyoko and Suzuka
are both good, too!

91
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,291
Their cooking
isn't as tasty,

92
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:53,500
but they control their familiars
like pros, don't they?

93
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,208
Natsume in particular.

94
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:58,041
It's like his familiar
is a part of him!

95
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,250
Like when he
burned himself.

96
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,291
He and his familiar
were completely linked.

97
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,541
It takes a lot of skill
to maintain total focus

98
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:08,208
on a simple familiar
through something like that.

99
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,416
[SUZUKA]
Here you go, Darling.

100
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,250
Huh?

101
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,666
What now?

102
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,541
It's my special curry!
I made it just for you, Sweetie.

103
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,416
I thought of you the
whole time I was cooking.

104
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,916
[HARUTORA] The assignment was
curry, not brown spicy stew.

105
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,708
Remember that I made it
especially for you, my Darling.

106
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,666
Be mean to me, and I may
pour it down your shorts.

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yuck.

108
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,291
But at least it's
better than that.

109
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,208
Ack! This stuff
is terrible!

110
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:43,625
That's why you wanted to
trade for mine isn't it?

111
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,500
Wow. You call
this crap curry?

112
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,083
Watch it.

113
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,833
You didn't even make anything,
so you don't get to judge me.

114
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,916
You got that,
Captain Headband?

115
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,500
So what?

116
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,541
You came all the way out here
just to chase after Harutora?

117
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,083
Don't be such a moron!

118
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,416
The only reason I'm here is
because your homeroom teacher,

119
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,166
Mister Ohtomo,
begged me to come.

120
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,083
[TOUJI sighs]

121
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,458
[TOUJI] Listen.
Can we talk?

122
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:08,708
[SUZUKA] Hm?

123
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,250
[HARUTORA] Ahh!

124
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,541
Ah!

125
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,458
[HARUTORA] The weird kid.

126
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:31,166
That was close!
Sorry about that!

127
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,833
[SUZU] Pssh.

128
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,208
What was that for?

129
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,125
Back off.
I don't know you.

130
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,583
Go away.

131
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,666
Alright, what's with
the cold shoulder routine?

132
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,125
Fine.

133
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,333
Kon?

134
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,000
M-Master Harutora?

135
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,500
Ah, yes. Nothing clears
away the stress

136
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,333
like petting your
soft, furry tail.

137
00:07:56,416 --> 00:08:00,000
[KON] Oh. I'm glad sir,
but--that tickles!

138
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,250
I remember now.

139
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:04,500
Salutations, Harutora
Tsuchimikado.

140
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,500
That's right.
Hello again.

141
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:07,916
Now then.

142
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,458
I guess I'll just go away as
you so delicately requested.

143
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:11,416
[SUZU] Please wait.

144
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,041
Oh yeah?

145
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,916
I thought you were too
cool to hang out with me.

146
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,208
[SUZU]
Just a misunderstanding.

147
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,500
Okay. So then you...

148
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,583
...do want to have
a chat with me?

149
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,041
Uh--That's right.

150
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,166
I would like that. Please.

151
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,583
[HARUTORA chuckles]

152
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:33,333
So unfair. Pulling out
a little girl like that.

153
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,958
But if it has come to this.

154
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,666
I should be allowed
to take her home.

155
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,916
[KON] Ahh!

156
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,208
Nope! In fact, you may
be crossing the line.

157
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,583
Never mind, then.

158
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,583
Come. The tail
should be enough.

159
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,333
[HARUTORA sighs]

160
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,750
All right. The tail.
But just for a little bit, okay?

161
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,333
Well? Kon?

162
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,916
[KON sighs]

163
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,708
Sublime.

164
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,958
Now please.
Talk about something.

165
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,375
Like start a
conversation?

166
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,791
Oh! I do have one question!

167
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,500
Is it possible to
make people think

168
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,208
a simple familiar is a human?

169
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:13,500
And could you still, like,
pull its strings from far away?

170
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,000
Certainly.

171
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:18,000
Of course, it would require
someone with a lot of skill

172
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,541
to maintain the connection.

173
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,083
And to make it
appear to be human.

174
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,083
[HARUTORA exhales]

175
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,500
[KON] Aahh!

176
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,375
[SUZU]
Ahh... This is divine.

177
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,375
I want her!

178
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:30,916
Not happening.

179
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,166
First ogre seal, let's Purge!

180

[SUZUKA gasps]

181
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:49,083
That's Phase Three.
So then, you're a half-ogre?

182
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:52,125
So tell me, do you
recognize this ogre, or what?

183
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:55,333
Honestly, all I can tell
you is it's a Type Ogre.

184
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:58,041
Even as a Divine General
I can't say much more.

185
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,708
It's past my area of expertise.

186
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,541
[TOUJI] I'm surprised
you don't know it.

187
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,625
Oh, and what is that
supposed to mean?

188
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,416
This ogre was summoned
two years ago

189
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,416
during the terrorist
attacks in Tokyo,

190
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,375
when a nut case from
the Twin Horn Syndicate

191
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,708
used himself as a trigger
for the disaster.

192
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:12,958
[SUZUKA gasps]

193
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:16,625
[TOUJI] That person's
name was Shido Dairenji.

194

The State Onmyo Mage First
Class known as 'Professor.'

195
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,416
And your dearly
departed father.

196
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,875
My--My father?

197
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,250
I'm sorry!

198
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,125
Reboot Purge.

199
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,958
[TOUJI] Now then, here's what
I really wanted to talk about.

200
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,541
I don't want to
dwell on the past.

201
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,541
I want to figure out how
we can shape the future.

202
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,666
[TOUJI] To cut to the chase,
I think it's time

203
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,208
we start talking about setting
up a partnership here.

204
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:53,541
Harutora and Natsume, would be
involved, and Kyoko and Tenma?

205
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,833
They'd want to be in there
somewhere, too, I'm sure.

206
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,458
[SUZUKA] Partnership?

207
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:00,541
[TOUJI] Natsume has become a
target of the Yakou devotees.

208
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,000
They think she's
the reincarnation.

209
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,500
Natsume's enemies are
Harutora's enemies.

210
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,083
And mine.

211
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,583
[SUZUKA gasps]

212
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,208
Whatever help you're
willing to give.

213
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,208
We'd just be happy to
have you on our side.

214
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,958
Whaddaya say?

215
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:21,208
Better buckle up.
Because this goes deeper.

216
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,583
Much deeper.

217
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,166
[HARUTORA]
The Twin Horn Syndicate?

218
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,458
[SUZUKA] It's a secret society
comprised of radical

219
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:30,291
Yakou devotees, and
it included my father,

220
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,666
who was responsible for the
spirit disaster two years ago.

221
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,166
[TENMA and KYOKO gasp]

222
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,375
It seems the weirdoes who came
looking for Natsume before

223
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,916
were also part of that group.

224
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,250
And then there are the rumors
that have been circulating.

225
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,458
They say that members of
the Twin Horn Syndicate

226
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,791
have even infiltrated
the Onmyo Agency.

227
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,833
It happened once
before, after all:

228
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,541
With my father and his
subordinate, Mutobe.

229
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:53,833
And Doman Ashiya,
also known as "D."

230
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,500
That was that old
dude we met.

231
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,958
The Magical Investigation
Bureau believes that "D"

232
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:01,583
still has connections
to the organization.

233
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:04,041
[NATSUME]
Um... Suzuka?

234
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,333
What is it?

235
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,875
Please tell me the truth,
once and for all.

236
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,958
Is it possible I really am
the reincarnation of Yakou?

237
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,625
Natsume! Come on.

238
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,083
You know that sounds nuts!

239
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,958
[NATSUME]
Harutora, I want to know.

240
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,875
Well, Suzuka?

241
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,583
[SUZUKA sighs]

242
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,250
If you're asking my opinion,
I believe it's true.

243
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,166
But there's no way
to know for sure.

244
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,250
You're all acting like
I'm some sort of expert

245
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,708
on what happened with Yakou.

246
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,333
But all I know is
what I've studied.

247
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:43,041
There was a report written by
a person called Ryou Saotome.

248
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:46,375
He served under my father
in the Ghost Division.

249
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,750
It definitely had a
focus on subject matter

250
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,916
considered to be
'publicly taboo.'

251
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,333
But the content of the report

252
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,375
tied a lot of the
threads together.

253
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,333
So do you think they
actually knew something?

254
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:59,250
And what do you think this
'Saotome' could be up to now?

255
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,625
[SUZUKA]
Who knows?

256
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,708
I couldn't find any additional
records on the guy.

257
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,208
Just this report.

258
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,958
This Saotome was barely in
the Ghost Division for a year.

259
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:10,125
No one knows where he is now.

260
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,666
His report made a claim.

261
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,583
Using something called
the Raven Coat,

262
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:14,791
would be the only way to tell

263
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,208
if someone was the
reincarnation of Yakou.

264
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,541
[gasps]

265
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,125
So what's that?

266
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,833
Wait, you mean you've seriously
never heard of the Raven Coat?

267
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,583
Something old Yakou
wore before he died.

268
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,375
[SUZUKA] It's supposedly in the
custody of the Onmyo Agency now.

269
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,625
If that's the case,

270
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,875
why don't we ask Kyoko's
dad if we can try it?

271
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,916
That reminds me,
I came up with a plan.

272
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,958
I decided to ask Suzuka
if she would help us

273
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,291
deal with all our
emergencies from now on.

And-- Well, I don't want to make
any assumptions or anything--

276
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,166
But Natsume, I thought
you could go along with

277
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,250
some of her experiments
in exchange.

Hold on, Touji!

I'm not just gonna let Natsume
do something so dangerous!

I'm asking Natsume, not you.

Well, uh--

00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,791
Trust me.

284

[SUZUKA]
Never mind.

285
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,125
I'm refusing on my end.

286
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,041
[HARUTORA] Eh?

But wait.

00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,666
Yeah, right.

of working with you amateurs.

[OHTOMO sips]

294
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,583
[OHTOMO] Ah. There's
nothing quite like

295
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,791
Mount Fuji by moonlight.

296
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,291
Ah! If you made it all the
way from Tokyo in that form,

297
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,541
consider me
suitably impressed.

298
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,916
So, I assume you went unnoticed
eavesdropping on the students'

299
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,500
little "strategy meeting"?

300
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,541
[MIYO] Correct.
And since you know about it,

301
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,958
you must have overheard
the conversation as well.

302
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:59,041
As their chaperone, it is my
solemn duty to supervise them.

303
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:02,250
Not the same as dabbling in
voyeurism for entertainment.

304
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,666
[MIYO] Oh. I completely
agree, Mister Ohtomo.

305
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,708
Just as I have
the responsibility

306
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,500
to supervise my faculty.

307
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:11,500
[OHTOMO] Hm. Have you
heard the rumors?

308

About the Raven Coat?

00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,333
[MIYO] I have not.

00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,458
The Raven Coat at
the Onmyo Agency.

311

The detractors say
it's merely a replica.

And who told you that?

it from Saotome.

[NATSUME grunts]

319
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,625
[HARUTORA]
Can't sleep either?

320
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,875
[NATSUME] No, I have
too much on my mind.

321
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,625
[NATSUME gasps]

322
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,750
I get it.
It's that meeting.

323
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,333
You're still
thinking about that?

324
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,291
[NATSUME sighs]

325
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,750
Don't worry
about it so much.

326
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,208
That reincarnation crap?
You being reborn?

327
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:10,083
It sounds pretty ridiculous
if you think about it, right?

328
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,541
Yeah, you're right.

329
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,291
I think I'm gonna
go for a soak.

330
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,208
[HARUTORA] Do you want
me to go with you?

331
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,333
What?
No, thanks!

332
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,125
I should be just
fine all by myself.

333
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,458
Stupid-tora.

334
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,041
[HARUTORA] Huh...?

335
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,583
Eh...!

336
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,166
[door opens]

337
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,750
[KYOKO] You don't
need a towel, kiddo!

338
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,000
We're both girls, aren't we?

339
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:52,583
[SUZUKA] Wait! Stop it!
Give me back my towel!

340
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,916
Aww...

341
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,833
Hey! What're you doing?

342
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,541
[KYOKO] You're so, like, the
cutest cute that ever cuted!

343
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,208
[SUZUKA]
Never ever call me cute!

344
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,750
[KYOKO] But you and I get to be
besties now, so it's fine!

345
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:03,458
Isn't it?

346
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:04,625
[SUZUKA] Certainly not!

347
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:05,750
Just because you're
from a good family,

348
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,458
does not mean I have
to tolerate this!

349
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,916
Anyway, give me back
my towel, you Holstein!

350
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,291
Or will your udders
get in the way?

351
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,500
[KYOKO] Oh?

352
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,125
Sounds like somebody
wishes hers were bigger!

353
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,208
[SUZUKA]
What do you know?

354
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,958
[KYOKO]
Easy there, kiddo.

355
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,833
Don't worry.
Your body's still growing...

356
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,833
[SUZUKA]
I'll cut 'em off, you cow!

357
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,208
[SUZUKA yells]
[splash]

358
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,875
[KYOKO laughs]

359
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,791
[KYOKO]
Oh, poor little Suzuka.

360
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,000
Did you fall down go boom
and get an ouchy?

361
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:31,500
[SUZUKA] Stop talking to me
like I'm a baby, you heifer!

362
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,166
[SUZUKA] 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10!

363
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,541
Done! That's ten,
I'm outta here!

364
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,625
[KYOKO] Hey.

365
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,500
Look, I've just got to ask.

366
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,958
Do you have a crush on Harutora?

367
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,750
[KYOKO] You look adorable
when you're blushing!

368
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,333
[SUZUKA] I'm not blushing,
I'm just red from the hot water!

369
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:51,625
Now stop trying to hug me!

370
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:52,958
[KYOKO] I'm right, aren't I?

371
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,125
[SUZUKA] As if!

372
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,083
Besides, that stupid
scumbag jerk

373
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,666
fell for someone
a long time ago!

374
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,375
[KYOKO]
What? Seriously?

375
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:00,625
[SUZUKA] Seriously!

376
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,083
[KYOKO] So, um. What do
you think about Natsume?

377
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,208
[NATSUME gasps]

378
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,333
I can tell you're
not his biggest fan.

379
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,458
You really don't know
anything, do you?

380
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,791
Huh?
What do you mean?

381
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,333
Forget it.
It doesn't matter.

382
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:21,208
I just don't like
people like that.

383
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,583
[MIYO] It's wonderful to
see you again, Yasuzumi!

384
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,291
The head of the Tsuchimikados
is always welcome.

385
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:39,291
It's been far too long
since you last visited!

386
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,333
You've been keeping busy,
though, haven't you?

387
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,750
Your familiar was
in Tokyo recently.

388
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,666
And apparently you
deemed it necessary

389
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,791
to examine one of our students.

390
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,500
[YASUZUMI] It seems a shadow
has appeared in your stars.

391
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:52,875
[MIYO gasps]

392
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,458
[NATSUME] I just don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

393
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,625
Suzuka apparently hates me.

394
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,375
And I-- Well...

395
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:09,291
Maybe it's time for me to deal
with things more honestly.

396
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,875
[TOUJI] You know
you have to tell him.

397
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,416
[NATSUME] Huh?

398
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,291
You're going to have to come
clean with Harutora eventually.

399
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,958
What? No. It's uh--

400
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,875
The timing's off, and
besides I couldn't do it.

401
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:25,291
I just-- I thought maybe I'd try
to find out how he feels first.

402
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,416
[TOUJI chuckles]

403
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,458
Good luck, then.

404
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:34,458
[KYOKO] Harutora. Will you
come with me for a sec?

405
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,208
[HARUTORA]
So, uh... What's up?

406
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,500
[KYOKO] Apparently, you're
too dense to figure it out.

407
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,000
And that means I'm gonna be
forced to spell it out for you.

408
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,458
We need Suzuka's help.
And you're the key.

409
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:48,083
Wait. I'm lost.
What does that mean?

410
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,291
I'm asking you!

411
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,458
Tell me exactly how
you feel about Suzuka!

412
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,583
What?
I'm confused.

413
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:56,333
Are you seriously trying to
say you haven't even noticed?

414
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,250
Noticed what?

415
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,875
That girl.
She's got a major cr--

416
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,750
[SUZUKA] You shut your mouth,
Breast-asaurus Rex!

417
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,333
What made you think you could
run your mouth off anyway,

418
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,708
ya big dumb milkmaid?

419
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,958
Besides, this jerkwad
already likes somebody else!

420
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,083
M-Master Harutora?

421
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,083
Wait, what?

422
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,458
That familiar
from last year!

423
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,416
You babbled about how she
wasn't your girlfriend,

424
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,833
but I know that you liked her!

425
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,791
You practically said that
you weren't over her.

426
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:24,125
That the real Hokuto was
still alive somewhere!

427
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,000
[KON] Huh?

428
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,250
Hokuto?

429
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,333
Oh, come on.

430
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,458
[HARUTORA sighs]

431
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,708
[HARUTORA] Alright.
Maybe it is time for the truth.

432
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,875
There's no point in lying now.

433
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,041
[KYOKO]
So, Harutora...

434
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,125
Did you have romantic
feelings about her?

435
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,500
Well, to be honest,

436
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,083
she and I were never
more than friends.

437
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,833
But I think later I realized
how much I liked her.

438
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,375
And now I just want
to see her again.

439
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:57,958
You know.

440
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,291
Whoever was manipulating her had
to have been incredibly gifted.

441
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,416
You were together for years.

442
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,166
But you never had
the slightest clue

443
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,500
that the girl was a familiar,
isn't that right?

444
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,666
That's impossible under
normal circumstances.

445
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,833
Natsume's the only
person I can think of.

446
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,458
Who else has enough skill
to be able to pull that off?

447
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,291
Unless there's
something I'm missing.

448
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,375
What?

449
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,791
No, impossible!
That's just ridiculous!

450
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,750
Hokuto's personality's
way different.

451
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,291
We're talking night and day.

452
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:25,458
Besides, why do something
so stalker-class weird?

453
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:26,750
[KYOKO] That's true.

454
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,291
It sounds more like
something a girl would do.

455
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,750
Plus, if Natsume was
the one manipulating her,

456
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,958
I definitely would've noticed
some sign of it by now.

457
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:37,833
[SUZUKA]
I'll rethink the deal.

458
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,208
[KYOKO] Huh?

459
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:42,041
The partnership Captain
Headband was talking about.

460
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,500
[KYOKO chuckles]

461
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,625
[KON] Huh?

462
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,375
[NATSUME] Stupid-tora.

463
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:19,583
[inaudible]

464
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:30,791
[HARUTORA gasps]

465
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,500
[HARUTORA] No way.

466
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:09,791
[KON] La, la la, la, la...

467
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:10,916
La la la!
