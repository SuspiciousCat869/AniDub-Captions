00:08:33,732 --> 00:08:35,365
He disappeared?

159
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:37,865
I assume that he was
a little disoriented.

160
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:40,698
This is not a good turn
of events, I'm afraid.

161
00:08:48,798 --> 00:08:49,765
[NATSUME] Stupid-tora.

162
00:08:49,798 --> 00:08:50,832
[HARUTORA] Huh?

163
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:53,632
[NATSUME] Why aren't you
going after him right now?

164
00:08:53,665 --> 00:08:54,865
What happened
to you, anyway?

165
00:08:54,898 --> 00:08:58,732
The Harutora I know wouldn't
hesitate to go after his friend.

166
00:08:58,765 --> 00:09:01,365
But I'm your familiar, and I
have a duty to protect you.

167
00:09:01,398 --> 00:09:02,332
You're my responsibility--

168
00:09:02,365 --> 00:09:04,565
[NATSUME] And you wonder
why I call you dumb.

169
00:09:04,598 --> 00:09:05,498
How could you ever protect me

170
00:09:05,532 --> 00:09:07,632
if you can't focus on
anything but him?

171
00:09:07,665 --> 00:09:09,132
[HARUTORA] But still, I--

172
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:11,065
Listen to me, Harutora.

173
00:09:18,465 --> 00:09:21,365
[MUTOBE] Soon, Chief.
Very soon.

174
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:27,162
[door opens]

175
00:09:27,196 --> 00:09:30,229
Relax, guys; there's no
need to be on edge.

176
00:09:30,262 --> 00:09:31,196
Come on in.

177
00:09:31,229 --> 00:09:34,529
I'm Zenjiro Kogure,
an independent exorcist.

178
00:09:34,562 --> 00:09:36,296
[panting]

179
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:37,796
[HARUTORA] Kon!

180
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:38,796
[KON] Yes, sir!

181
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:41,296
I need you to help me
find Touji immediately!

182
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:43,862
I will do everything
in my power, Master!

183
00:09:43,896 --> 00:09:45,996
[HARUTORA] Tenma, you start
looking over there!

184
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:47,229
[TENMA] You got it.

185
00:09:47,262 --> 00:09:49,962
[panting]

186
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:57,996
[KOGURE] Want some?

187
00:09:58,029 --> 00:09:59,296
[KYOKO and NATSUME] Mm-mm.

188
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:01,529
[KOGURE] Suit yourselves.
They're good.

189
00:10:01,562 --> 00:10:03,196
Sorry we had to call
you out here like this.

190
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:05,662
[KYOKO] No problem.

191
00:10:05,696 --> 00:10:08,829
I think it'll be best if
you two just accompany me.

192
00:10:08,862 --> 00:10:11,896
I'll basically be your personal
bodyguard; does that sound okay?

193
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:13,796
You're one of
the Divine Generals.

194
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:16,896
Yes. You shouldn't
waste time on us.

195
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:18,962
You're not a waste,
don't worry about it.

196
00:10:18,996 --> 00:10:20,596
Besides, everyone in
the department will be

197
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:23,729
rallying today. It won't
turn into two years ago.

198
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:26,196
I hope not.

199
00:10:26,229 --> 00:10:29,029
Natsume, the key to
this plan is you.

200
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:32,596
We have to lure out
the nue. We can't fail.

201
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:36,729
Positive you
don't want any?

202
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:42,029
[NATSUME] Thank you.

203
00:10:42,062 --> 00:10:43,929
We actually haven't
eaten anything since lunch.

204
00:10:43,962 --> 00:10:45,662
I'm starving.

205
00:10:47,262 --> 00:10:50,729
By the way. Jin is your
homeroom teacher, isn't he?

206
00:10:53,062 --> 00:10:56,829
By Jin, you mean,
like, Mister Ohtomo?

207
00:10:56,862 --> 00:10:58,662
Yeah, we went to
school together.

208
00:10:58,696 --> 00:10:59,662
Same place as you girls.

209
00:10:59,696 --> 00:11:01,962
[KYOKO] What? Are you
telling me Mister Ohtomo

210
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:04,229
is still, like,
just twenty something?

211
00:11:04,262 --> 00:11:05,729
[OHTOMO] Hm?

212
00:11:05,762 --> 00:11:07,896
We were in the
thirty-sixth class, yeah.

213
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:10,796
Everybody called us the
Three Crows back then.

214
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:13,196
[KYOKO] If there were three
crows, who was the third one?

215
00:11:13,229 --> 00:11:14,862
[HIRATA] Excuse me.

216
00:11:16,562 --> 00:11:18,962
[KOGURE] This is Hirata from
the Magic Investigation Bureau.

217
00:11:18,996 --> 00:11:21,729
He'll be coming
along with us today.

218
00:11:21,762 --> 00:11:24,896
Nice to meet you.
I'm an MIB investigator.

219
00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:25,929
We're glad you're here.

220
00:11:25,962 --> 00:11:27,562
[NATSUME gasps]

221
00:11:30,896 --> 00:11:32,662
[HIRATA] I know what you're
thinking, but my colleague's

222
00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:35,196
actions were a disgrace
to the Bureau's good name.

223
00:11:35,229 --> 00:11:38,562
I deeply and sincerely
apologize on his behalf.

224
00:11:39,996 --> 00:11:42,262
Believe me when I say
I am on your side.

225
00:11:42,296 --> 00:11:43,762
Yes. Of course.

226
00:11:43,796 --> 00:11:45,596
Bring it down a bit;
that's a lot of pressure.

227
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:47,029
You're just making
Natsume feel awkward.

228
00:11:47,062 --> 00:11:47,929
[NATSUME] No, it's fine.

229
00:11:47,962 --> 00:11:50,662
[HIRATA] I'm only
trying to apologize.

230
00:11:50,696 --> 00:11:52,296
Like I said,
I'll protect you.

231
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:54,962
But don't ever let
your guard down.

232
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:56,629
[KYOKO and NATSUME] Right!

233
00:12:00,796 --> 00:12:04,896
[TOUJI] "You're an ogre.
Do you have any emotions?"

234
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:08,529
Who was it that said
that first? A teacher?

235
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,996
My mother, aka the mistress?

236
00:12:12,796 --> 00:12:14,996
[TOUJI] Either way, it was true.

237
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:19,596
I had no feeling, or more
accurately, no passion.

238
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:22,762
I just kept looking for
something to fill the void.

239
00:12:22,796 --> 00:12:24,129
Back then, I was
always on the hunt

240
00:12:24,162 --> 00:12:28,662
for some sort of trouble
to get into. A distraction.

241
00:12:28,696 --> 00:12:32,196
But I never expected to be
attacked by a real ogre.

242
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:34,829
I'd rather be in control
of how this ends.

243
00:12:34,862 --> 00:12:37,262
So I might as well roll
with what's happening.

244
00:12:37,296 --> 00:12:40,229
I don't really care what
goes down after that.

245
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:45,029
[panting]

246
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:48,029
[HARUTORA] Damn it. Where
did that idiot run off to?

247
00:12:55,262 --> 00:12:58,596
[HARUTORA] Shibuya's too big.
I can't search every street.

00:13:01,962 --> 00:13:03,596
[HARUTORA] I'm sorry!

251
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:04,396
[DRUNK MAN 8A]
You should be!

252
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:06,696
You need to watch
where you step!

253
00:13:06,729 --> 00:13:08,829
[HARUTORA] Great. I don't
have time for this!

254
00:13:08,862 --> 00:13:10,296
[DRUNK MAN 8A] I don't
like your attitude!

255
00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:13,296
[KAKUGYOUKI] I wouldn't
fight him if I were you.

256
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:15,629
A boring fight isn't worth
it for the ones fighting

257
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:19,529
or the ones watching.
You should let it go at that.

258
00:13:19,562 --> 00:13:22,862
Otherwise, the kid's gonna
get a little help from me.

259
00:13:22,896 --> 00:13:25,829
And I guarantee I can
make it interesting.

260
00:13:27,596 --> 00:13:28,562
[DRUNK MAN 8B] Let's go.

261
00:13:28,596 --> 00:13:29,996
[DRUNK MAN 8C] Damn.

262
00:13:30,762 --> 00:13:32,096
Lucky for them they
weren't too drunk

263
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:34,796
to make the right decision.

264
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:37,629
[HARUTORA] Thank you, sir.
I appreciate your help!

265
00:13:37,662 --> 00:13:41,229
You looking for someone?
I don't know who that might be,

266
00:13:41,262 --> 00:13:44,629
but I did see a boy
wearing your same uniform.

267
00:13:44,662 --> 00:13:46,062
He looked a little strange.

268
00:13:46,096 --> 00:13:49,629
You tend to remember the
ones that stand out, right?

269
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,729
That sounds like him.
Where'd he go?

270
00:13:51,762 --> 00:13:53,729
[KAKUGYOUKI]
He's up that way.

271
00:13:53,762 --> 00:13:57,229
The practical exam.
Thank you again!

272
00:13:57,262 --> 00:13:58,729
I hope you
find him soon.

273
00:13:58,762 --> 00:14:00,162
[HARUTORA] Me too.

[NATSUME]
Listen to me, Harutora.

277
00:14:19,262 --> 00:14:22,262
I can fulfill the
Tsuchimikados' duty by myself.

278
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:24,196
At the moment, you have
something far more important

279
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:26,796
you need to take care of.
Find your friend

280
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:30,829
and bring him back.
You can protect me afterwards.

281
00:14:30,862 --> 00:14:33,096
I dunno; will you be
okay all by yourself?

282
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:35,529
[KYOKO] He won't be by himself!

283
00:14:35,562 --> 00:14:37,729
I'll go with Natsume, so you
don't have to worry.

284
00:14:37,762 --> 00:14:39,229
[HARUTORA] Are you sure?

285
00:14:39,262 --> 00:14:40,929
Don't you remember
what you told him?

286
00:14:40,962 --> 00:14:42,829
About letting others help?

287
00:14:42,862 --> 00:14:45,129
You can depend on us,
too, you know.

288
00:14:45,162 --> 00:14:46,762
Thank you.

289
00:14:46,796 --> 00:14:50,229
[NATSUME] Harutora.
You need to get going.

290
00:14:50,262 --> 00:14:51,729
Yeah. Right.

291
00:14:51,762 --> 00:14:52,996
When you find him,
you should make him

292
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:55,229
buy you some sort of reward!

293
00:15:00,162 --> 00:15:02,829

00:15:02,862 --> 00:15:04,729
[TOUJI] What're you here for?

295
00:15:04,762 --> 00:15:07,796
Uh, to get you, obviously.
Come on, let's go.

296
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,720
[NATSUME] Most people still
blame the Tsuchimikado family

297
00:15:14,753 --> 00:15:18,553
for the spirit disasters.
But at the same time,

298
00:15:18,586 --> 00:15:21,853
we're the ones who make it
possible to purify them.

299
00:15:21,886 --> 00:15:24,553
These exorcists must have
pretty conflicted feelings

300
00:15:24,586 --> 00:15:29,320
about me being here.
But none of that matters now.

301
00:15:29,353 --> 00:15:31,553
It doesn't change
what I need to do.

[TOUJI] This is
pathetic, isn't it?

306
00:15:43,753 --> 00:15:46,720
Sure, the principal added
a few nails here and there.

307
00:15:46,753 --> 00:15:49,386
But the lid,
it still opened.

308
00:15:51,553 --> 00:15:53,653
[HARUTORA] I don't
feel the ogre spirit,

309
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:56,820
but I definitely smell an ogre.

310

Something about the ogre living
in people's dark passions?

313
00:16:02,953 --> 00:16:04,853
And you told Dad not to worry,

314
00:16:04,886 --> 00:16:06,453
that you didn't
have any passions,

315
00:16:06,486 --> 00:16:09,386

in you for an ogre live.
