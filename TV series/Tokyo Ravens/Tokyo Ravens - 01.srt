[YOUNG HARUTORA] Okay.

00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,791
I'll become your
familiar, Natsume.

00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:53,750
[YOUNG HARUTORA]
I'll protect you forever.

[FEMALE TEACHER] Current onmyo
magic consists of Japanese magic

8
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:04,416
that was brought together,
refined, and simplified

9
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,666
during World War II.

[FEMALE TEACHER] Using that
magic, the Onmyo Agency

12
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:12,291
has been undergoing purification
of the spiritual disaster

13
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:14,083
two years ago.

14
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:16,750
The Onmyo Mages who serve in
the Exorcism Bureau within

00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:19,541
the Agency are responsible
for this purification,

16
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:21,500
while other Bureaus
within the Agency

17
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,666
offer their support
in various ways.

I'm so wiped.

00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,250
Yeah, I can tell.

24
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,500
Aren't you?
It's freaking hot.

25
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:25,750
It's cooler here than it is
in Tokyo, that's for sure.

26
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,333
Gone.
I want more.

27
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,166
[HARUTORA]
Yeah, me too.

28
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,625
Awesome.
I've been cursed.

29
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:37,125
Big shock. I guess
that runs in my family.

30
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,333
Yeah, knowing the history,

31
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,666
I'd say that's
entirely possible.

32
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,708
She's here.

33
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:43,541
[HARUTORA] Huh?

34
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,958
[HOKUTO] Harutora!

35
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,583
H-Hokuto?

36
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,916
I've been calling you.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,916
How come you didn't
answer? Stupid-tora!

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,708
[HARUTORA]
Because I was in summer school!

39
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,208
[HOKUTO] Oh.

40
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,791
Well, I suppose that makes
sense, Great King of the F's!

41
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,833
Okay, I'll accept
your lame excuse.

42
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:02,458
But I'm still gonna find a way
for you to make it up to me.

43
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,416
This is ridiculous.

44
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,541
I don't understand why I
had to buy you a snow cone.

45
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:17,041
Hey! That's mine; get
your greedy paws off!

46
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:20,958
Ow, my head!
I totally got a brain freeze!

47
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,250
Good, that's
what you get.

48
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,916
[TOUJI] So, Hokuto?

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,208
Isn't it about time for you
to start lecturing him again?

50
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,750
[HOKUTO] Hmph.

51
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,666
Harutora, have you
made up your mind?

52
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,166
[HARUTORA groans]

53
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,916
Become an onmyo mage.
You better not say "no"!

54
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,666
[HARUTORA] Uh--Sorry.

55
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,500
[HOKUTO]
Come on, Harutora.

56
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,875
You're part of the
Tsuchimikado family,

57
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,250
descendants of Abe no Seimei.

58
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,833
How could you not want to
be an official Onmyo Mage?

59
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,000
It's in your blood!

60
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,416
[HARUTORA] Hokuto.
I've already told you.

61
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,250
Yeah, I'm a Tsuchimikado,
but I'm from a branch family,

62
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,750
and besides,
I'm not a spirit seer.

63
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,958
I don't have any talents.

64
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,625
I'm just too normal
to be a mage.

65
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,583
Someone gifted should
represent my family,

66
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:15,416
not someone who has
to go to summer school.

67
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,166
Oh, you mean like that one
girl from the main family?

68
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,375
[chiming]

69
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,541
Yep. She's already been
named the next head,

70
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,291
and better her than me.

71
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:27,833
She's been in Tokyo at the
Onmyo Prep School since spring.

72
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,666
And she's totally different from
us losers, that's for sure.

73
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,791
[HOKUTO]
That's a buncha bull.

74
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,375
Why doesn't that bug you?

75
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,500
Because I like life better
without expectations.

76
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,000
[HOKUTO] For real?

77
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,333
[HARUTORA] Huh?

78
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,833
Harutora, you can't
honestly believe that

79
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,000
no one expects
anything of you.

80
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,875
Yeah. I do.

81
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:52,750
[NATSUME]
Liar. Liar!

82
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,875
[TOUJI] Harutora.

83
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,166
You're drippin' there.

84
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,000
Aaahh!

85
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,458
Hah! It looks like you peed!

86
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,750
Shut up!

87
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:00,541
Damn it.

88
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:01,291
[HOKUTO] Here.

89
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,791
[HARUTORA] Thanks. Jeez.

90
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,333
So, we're done with
career counseling now, right?

91
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,750
What's the plan for tomorrow?

92
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,166
Oh. This'll be your
first fireworks festival

93
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,250
since you got here.
You excited for it?

94
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,291
I guess.

95
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,750
So you're coming over
tomorrow, right?

96
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,291
We can head out as soon as
you finish with your checkup.

97
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,541
Yeah, that sounds
good to me.

98
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,000
Ow! I got a stupid
brain freeze again!

99
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,000
[HARUTORA]
Hey, that's mine!

100
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,291
[HOKUTO]
See you later, Touji!

101
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,583
[TOUJI] Later.

102
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,625
You should be
an onmyo mage.

103
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,416
Stupid-tora!

104
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,083
No! Go away!

105
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,166
[HOKUTO giggles]

106
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,125
[HARUTORA grunts]

107
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,750
[HARUTORA] Man, when
did she get so pushy?

108
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:48,625
She was pretty normal
until last year.

109
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:52,125
[TOUJI] Yeah, I dunno;
that girl is full of mysteries.

110
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,791
She doesn't know
jack, though.

111
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:57,291
Nobody cares if you're from the
Tsuchimikado family anymore.

112
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,666
I guess that's all
thanks to "Yakou," right?

113
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,250
That's right.

114
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,083
I mean, she's gotta have some
clue about all that, you know?

115
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,916
I'd be surprised if
anybody hadn't heard by now.

116
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,333
What do you think?

117
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,916
I dunno.

118
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,458
It's like I already said; that
girl is full of mysteries, dude.

119
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,041
[HARUTORA sighs]

120
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:16,458
[TOUJI] Harutora.

121
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:17,875
[HARUTORA] Huh?

122
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,125
You seriously don't even
want to give it a try, do you?

123
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,625
[HARUTORA]
Not you, too!

124
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,375
We both know I don't
have any talent!

125
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,625
It's not a matter
of talent.

126
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,625
It's a matter of will.

127
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:31,208
I did think about it when
I was a kid, if that counts.

128
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:34,041
You've got way more talent than
you give yourself credit for.

129
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,958
[HARUTORA] Huh?

130
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,458
[TOUJI]
See you tomorrow.

131
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,708
Yeah.
Sure thing.

132
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:10,500
One more year,
just the three of us.

133
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,583
[chiming]

134
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,583
[HARUTORA] Natsume?

135
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,333
How come you're
not back in Tokyo?

136
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,833
Oh, yeah.
Summer vacation.

137
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:47,583
Hello there, Harutora.
Long time no see.

138
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:54,875
So, uh--

139
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,791
So how are your parents?

140
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,916
I haven't seen either
of them in a long time.

141
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,458
I hope they're doing well.

142
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,416
Oh, they're doing good.
Really good.

143
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,250
We could go see 'em?

144
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:07,416
[NATSUME] I wish I could,
but I don't have much time.

145
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,166
[HARUTORA]
When are you going back?

146
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,500
[NATSUME] In a week.

147
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,458
[HARUTORA] Yeah?
Is school hard?

148
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,666
The classes are fine
for the most part.

149
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,000
The tradition is a little
tricky, though.

150
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:23,166
Oh. I mean--
school is fine.

151
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,291
Have you made any
friends so far?

152
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,625
Have I made friends?

153
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,458
I have the duty of
being the next head

154
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,125
of the Tsuchimikado family.

155
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,416
I do not have time to waste

156
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,750
by spending my days
idly or making friends.

157
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,791
Oh man, you need
to lighten up.

158
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,791
And you need to realize
that I am nothing like you.

159
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,833
Well, you would know, right?

00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,541
hanging out with you guys?

318
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,875
Isn't that what
you want, too?

319
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,916
[HOKUTO] I uh...

320
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,166
I can't really explain it.

321
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,208
I just think you should
be an onmyo mage,

322
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,666
and I won't change my mind!

323
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,125
[NATSUME] Liar.

324
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:14,125
[loud clack]

325
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,791
[HOKUTO gasps]

326
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,750
[HOKUTO] You're so stupid!

327
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,125
You're so stupid!

328
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:30,625
Ah, yes, to be young.
So dramatic.

329
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:31,791
[HARUTORA] Yeah.

330
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,875
Hey, do you think I was wrong?

331
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,125
Nah. I think that
one's on Hokuto.

332
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,833
She should know by now that
you're a hopeless cause.

333
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,750
[HARUTORA sighs]

334
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,750
You've pissed two girls
off in one day. Nice.

335
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,875
Wow, no sympathy?
I'm a little depressed here.

336
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,625
Oh, sorry, dude;
you're depressed?

337
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,875
Imagine how she must feel.

338
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,375
Hey, you want motivation,
I can totally hit you.

339
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,125
Will that make
you go after her?

340
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,875
No. Thanks, but, uh,

341
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:04,291
something tells me that I might
end up regretting that more.

342
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,958
It's just these are supposed to
be the best days of our lives,

343
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,458
so I'd rather spend
them with you two.

344
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,750
[SUZUKA] 
Hey, you. Genius kid.

345
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,541
Interested in taking
part in my experiment?

346
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,958
You're Natsume
Tsuchimikado, right?

347
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:29,291
Unfortunately. I'm just
a boring, regular guy.

348
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,250
I think this one here's
the one you're looking for.

349
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:31,958
[HARUTORA] Uhh!

350
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,333
You have to be joking.

351
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,291
[HARUTORA] I am a
Tsuchimikado, but--

352
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,375
[TOUJI] Haven't I seen
you in a magazine?

353
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,375
You're the youngest of
the Twelve Divine Generals,

354
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:40,250
aren't you?

355
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,833
The Prodigy, Suzuka Dairenji?

356
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,333
You know a lot for
just a regular guy.

357
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:47,958
But you--rumor has it you're
supposed to be this big genius.

358
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,708
You look kinda stupid to me.

359
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,083
Stupid?
That's rude!

360
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,250
Just go along
with it.

361
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,041
What for?

362
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,125
'Cause who knows, it
might be an adventure.

363
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,875
[HARUTORA]
You're messed up.

364
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,166
[HARUTORA sighs]

365
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,416
Okay fine, what do
you want from me?

366
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,625
[SUZUKA] I told you.

367
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,625
I want you to help me
with my experiment.

368
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,541
It's the same magic performed
by Yakou Tsuchimikado,

369
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,458
I'm sure you've heard of
the Great Spirit Method?

370
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,791
The Taizan Fukun Ritual.

371
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,291
[HARUTORA and TOUJI] Uhh...

372
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,541
[SUZUKA] A barrier?

373
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:36,708
Heh.

374
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,625
The Agency?

375
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,291
[MALE OFFICER 1A]
State Onmyo Mage First Class,

376
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,458
Suzuka Dairenji.

377
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,000
You're under arrest for
the use of forbidden magic.

378
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,666
Magical
Investigators.

379
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,250
Why is the
Bureau after her?

380
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:52,416
[MALE OFFICER 1A] Surrender!
We will shoot if we have to!

381
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,791
It's Asura,
the artificial-type Model M3

382
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,833
built by the Onmyo Agency!

383
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,333
[MALE OFFICER 1A] Huh?

384
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,291
I detest the countryside.

385
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,208
There are just far
too many bugs!

386
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,125
[OFFICERS yell]

387
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,458
[TOUJI yells]

388
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:57,666
[HARUTORA]
Touji! Touji! Aah!

389
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,333
[HARUTORA] Huh?

390
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,166
Want some?

391
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,916
Let me go!

392
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,833
Can't do that;
I need you too much.

393
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,333
[HOKUTO] Put him down!

394
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:22,000
[footsteps]

395
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,125
You let Harutora
go this instant!

396
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,791
Hokuto!
Don't be an idiot!

397
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:26,583
Run!

398
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,500
Did she
say Harutora?

399
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,083
What is the
meaning of this?

400
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,166
Stop it!

401
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,791
You shut your ugly mouth!

402
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:45,000
My dear boy.
Are you underestimating me?

403
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,250
Nope.
Not at all.

404
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,958
[SUZUKA]
Tell Natsume Tsuchimikado

405
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,375
something for me, would you?

406
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,125
Tell him I'm coming for him.

407
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,500
Fail to deliver my message,

408
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,208
and I'll have to
cut off your balls!

409
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,291
[HARUTORA whimpers]

410
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:00,375
Oh, by the way.
Is that your girlfriend?

411
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:01,333
[HARUTORA] No.

412
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:04,250
Oh good.
Then she won't mind.

413
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,500
[gasps]

414
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:04,916
[KON] I will attack!
I will stab! I will twist.

415
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,833
And then, I will sharpen.

416
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:10,958
I will attack.
I will stab! I will twist!
