[SUZUKA] Darling!

6
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,750
Good morning, how are you?

7
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,250
[HARUTORA] Oh, hi Suzuka.

8
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,791
[SUZUKA] How lucky
am I to get to see you

9
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,125
first thing in the morning?

10
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,958
[STUDENTS whisper]
Oh, man, did you see that?

11
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,250
[SUZUKA]
Here. Take this.

12
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,708
[NATSUME] Huh?

13
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:49,916
[NATSUME yells]

14
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,291
And please be
careful with my bag!

15
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,458
That old thing!

16
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,208
It weighs almost
as much as me! Heh!

17
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,125
But that's no big deal
to you, am I right?

18
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,083
I just know you can handle it.

19
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,916
I mean, since
you're a boy and all.

20
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,166
This should be fun.

21
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,375
[TOUJI] Things are starting to
get interesting around here.

22
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,916
[HARUTORA]
Yeah, thanks for nothing!

23
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,791
[TOUJI] I mean I thought for
sure she'd rat you guys out

24
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,458
right away, but I
guess I was wrong.

25
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,333
Heh. She's definitely
got spunk, that one, huh?

26
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:18,750
[NATSUME] Oh man.

27
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,750
I thought I would never be
able to lift my arm again.

28
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:22,958
Okay.

29
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,125
The only thing I can
think of is negotiation.

30
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,708
[NATSUME] Huh?

31
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,250
[HARUTORA] Maybe I can talk her
out of treating us so crappy.

32
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,000
You think it'll work?

33
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,250
Yeah, just leave it to me.

34
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,041
[HARUTORA groans]

35
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,500
[SUZUKA] What? Do
you seriously think

36
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,166
the two of you can talk
your way out of this?

37
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,166
Thanks anyway.

38
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,333
[SUZUKA] What? You realize
you have no other choice

39
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,666
than to say,
"Yes, sir." right?

40
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,833
[NATSUME] Sorry.
Yes, sir.

41
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,125
[HARUTORA] Hey!

42
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,458
I got some!

43
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,416
Heh, heh. A-Aahh!

44
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,208
[SUZUKA] Hey!

45
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,583
Did you forget to say
"sir" to me yet again?

46
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:03,833
It's very
important.

47
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,291
Beginning and end
of everything.

48
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,708
Sir! Yes, sir!

49
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,875
Darling.
I need a vanilla shake.

50
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,875
As in now.

51
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,708
[HARUTORA]
My pleasure!

52
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,500
[HARUTORA] I'm sorry.

53
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,041
Your hair is losing its shine.

54
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,625
And you have split ends.

00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,625
[NATSUME]
It's okay, Harutora.

56
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:36,958
Speaking of, your eyes kind
of look like dead fish eyes.

57
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,041
[HARUTORA] Well, let's
look at the positives.

58
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,833
At least we don't have
to see her face today.

59
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,416
[NATSUME] For real.

60
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,625
I think this is the most I've
ever looked forward to a day off

Shut up.

Are you kidding me?

00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,625
That's lame.

81
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,875
Don't tell me you got a tiger
because the last part

82
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,166
of your name means
"tiger." Ya loser.

Yeah, well I don't really
give a crap what you think!

[SUZUKA] Hmm...

85
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,583
Whatever.

86
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,375
[NATSUME] As a punishment
for not picking up the phone,

87
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,500
she made us show
her Harutora's room.

88
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,250
That makes total sense.

89
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,250
[SUZUKA] What's with
this varsity jacket?

Because your fashion sense is
a nightmare; this is atrocious.

Eh?

95

96
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,750
So, what's the
big verdict?

97
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,708
It's boring
as all get out.

98
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,083
There's nothing cool here.

99

No nudie magazines or
anything even remotely fun.

Come on!
Go away!

Honestly,
I gotta agree.

102

He's kinda boring.

103

Dude, you need to expand
your horizons a bit.

104

[HARUTORA] Hey, what's
that supposed to mean?

105
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,416
Wait, I know where
you should look.

106
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,458
Check out
his closet.

107
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,375
[HARUTORA] Nooo!

108
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,208
Please, I'm begging you.

109
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,916
Please just go!

110
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,166
Gross.

111
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,291
It stops being fun once
they start the begging.

112
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,833
I guess we can just leave it
at you're lame and boring.

113

[HARUTORA sighs]

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,083
[SUZUKA] Moving on!

115
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,541
How about we hit up
Natsume's room next?

116
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,791
[HARUTORA]
Huh?

117
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,333
No way!
I refuse to let you in.

118
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,708
No means no!

119
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,375
[SUZUKA] What? Why would
you think it's okay

120
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,833
for you to speak
to me like that?

121
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,875
[SUZUKA chuckles]

122
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,833
[NATSUME] Order!

123
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,416
Oh no you don't!

124
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:31,666
[NATSUME] Aahh!
Let go! Let me go!

125
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,375
[SUZUKA]
No way, are you kidding?

126
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,208
What's wrong with
your room anyway?

127
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,708
This reaction just makes
me want to see it more!

128
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,708
Jeez, how bad can it be?

129

Niku gyoichi yomi.

134
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:02,166
I knew she had to have it
protected with a spell.

135
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,041
[muffled scream]

136
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,125
[SUZUKA]
How careless.

137
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,833
Hah. Nothing but
a defense spell.

138
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,500
Yeah. Doubtful.

139
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:27,416
[SUZUKA]
Ugh. A tiger here, too?

140
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,416
Huh, I've never been in
Natsume's room before.

141
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,625
[TOUJI] With her reaction,

142
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,000
I figured there was
something awful in here,

143
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,583
but uh, maybe not.

144
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,666
Everything looks normal to me.

145
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,833
You are so wrong.

146
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:41,416
Believe you me.
This place is protected.

147
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,416
The barrier is well hidden, but
the spell is quite elaborate.

148
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,833
Whatever she's got,
it's in there.

149
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,916
[TOUJI] Wait, are you saying
she's using another spell

150
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,291
inside the room?

151
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:52,375
[TOUJI] Ow...

152
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:53,875
That hurt.

153
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,333
[SUZUKA] Idiots.

154
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,708
This one is a lot stronger
than the spell on the door.

155
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,333
You might wanna take cover.

156
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,416
How come this one's
so much worse?

157
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,333
It's just a stupid
closet door, right?

158
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,958
Yeah, but it looks like it'll
take some time to crack.

159
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:10,541
At least I'll have something
interesting to do!

160
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,916
On! Sojiri shu sowaka.

161
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,166
On! Makarishiei
jiribei sowaka...

162
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,625
[TOUJI]
What do you think?

163
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,416
Maybe we should just mosey
on outside for a little bit?

164
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,541
[TOUJI] Whoa!

165
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,791
[muffled screams]

166
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,416
[SUZUKA]
Oh, you're so noisy!

167
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,375
Do you want people to find
out that you're a girl?

168
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,666
I said, shut, up!

169
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,375
[muffled yells]

170
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,875
I can't watch anymore.
This is too much for me.

171
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,500
Kon, break the
binds on Natsume!

172
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,083
Um...

173
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:45,916
Master Harutora, what did the
witch mean by nudie magazines?

174
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,541
Will you just
do it already?

175
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,375
[KON] O-Okay!

176
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,875
[KON] No!
This is bad touching!

177
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,416
[SUZUKA yells]

178
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,416
I need you, Hokuto.

179
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,250
Come, now.
Guard the door.

180
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,833
[KON groans]

181
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:40,083
[yawns]

182
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:45,833
[beeping]

183
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,833
[KON yells]

184
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,375
Oh! Master Harutora!

185
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,916
Um. Good morning to you.

186
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,458
Yeah. Good morning
to you, too.

187
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,041
[HARUTORA]
Hey, Kon?

188
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,625
Yes, sir?

189
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:06,500
I'm just wondering why you're in
your physical form this morning.

190
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,000
[KON]
I-I didn't even realize.

191
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,791
[HARUTORA yawns]

192
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,625
[KON]
Ah! Master Harutora!

193
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:14,916
[HARUTORA] Hm?

194
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,750
I can't get rid of
my physical form!

195
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,166
[HARUTORA] Hmm?

196
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,791
[NATSUME] She can't get
rid of her physical form?

197
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,833
[HARUTORA]
Yeah, and I have no idea why.

198
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,458
Her invisibility
isn't working, either.

199
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,833
Of course. The familiar
can't function properly

200
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,958
if the master is weak,
now can it?

201
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,291
Tell me something.

202
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:39,333
Why are you just walking
with us like we like you?

203
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:42,041
So this is just a random
guess, but hear me out.

204
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,291
Yesterday, Natsume
threw Kon into Suzuka

205
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,000
while she was in the
middle of a spell, yeah?

206
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:50,208
Wouldn't you think this might
have something to do with that?

207
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,875
[HARUTORA]
Yeah, good point.

208
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,125
You know, maybe we should
ask Mister Ohtomo about it

209
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,500
when we get to school,
and see what he says.

210
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,583
[NATSUME] I don't think
that's what it is.

211
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,291
This has nothing to
do with my closet.

212
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,250
Something else must
be going on here.

213
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:06,000
And no matter what,
it's not like this is my fault.

214
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,833
So there's no reason
to tell the teacher.

215
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,083
Kay, darling?

216
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,833
[NATSUME]
Better keep moving.

217
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,708
[SUZUKA] Good plan.

218
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,375
Natsume wouldn't say anything
about what she has in her closet

219
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,666
even after Miss Fujino
asked her about it.

220
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,041
And Suzuka doesn't
want to tarnish

221
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,708
the innocent girl impression
she's been laying down.

222
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:28,041
Yep. Those two
are terrifying.

223
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,625
[KON] How unfortunate.

224
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,166
Look at me, stuck here
at home doing nothing.

225
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,083
Meanwhile nefarious people
could be out there

226
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,708
being disrespectful.

227
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,708
Ahh, I'm beside
myself with worry!

228
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,500
In the first place,
Master Harutora is too kind.

229
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,000
Oh, not that I'm criticizing
his kindness in the least.

230
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:47,375
I would never criticize anything
about Master Harutora.

231
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,708
I just have to take care
of those nefarious people,

232
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,666
so we won't have a problem.

233
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,041
There's no doubt about it.

234
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,708
I should be by
Master Harutora's side.

235
00:12:55,791 --> 00:13:01,416
[KON bawls]

236
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,083
Ah! I know!

237
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,500
I can go and protect
him in disguise.

238
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,250
I don't have to
worry my master.

239
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,875
I'll just quietly protect
him from the shadows.

240
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,708
A protecting ninja!

241
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,708
Doesn't that sound cool?
I love making good decisions.

242
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,208
[KON] Don't worry.

243
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:24,250
I'll be right over to help,
Master Harutora!

244
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,000
[sniffs]

245
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:29,333
Wow! It smells
just like him.

246
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,041
[ALPHA]
Oh, if it isn't Kon.

247
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,583
[KON] Wrong!
I am not Kon.

248
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,208
Excuse me!

249
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,000
[ALPHA]
That was Kon, wasn't it?

250
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,791
[OMEGA] Yes, that
was definitely Kon.

251
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,583
[KON]
I can't see.

252
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,458
Fine, in that case.

253
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:04,083
Yay! I found you!
You'll be protected now!

254
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,833
Oh no, he's yawning.

255
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,625
Is he not getting enough sleep?

256
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,125
Oh poor master.

257
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,875
What? Natsume's mad at him!

258
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,291
Why? It was just a yawn!

259
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:16,875
Everyone dozes off now and then.

260
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,916
I can't believe Touji's
sleeping in class.

261
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,125
What a terrible
student and person.

262
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,416
[KON sighs]

263
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,041
I don't know if this
place is suitable

264
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,708
for my Master after all.
What a shame.

265
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,125
You know, I can't believe
the teacher hasn't noticed

266
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,916
and said something.
That's just bad administration.

267
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,250
If he left,

268
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,000
it could be just me and
Master Harutora together.

269
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:40,125
Oh, that would be great!
I like this plan already!

270
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,708
[bells ring]

271
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,625
[KON] No way.
Is it really lunchtime?

272
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,041
[murmuring]

273
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:51,083
[HARUTORA] Man, for some reason,
I'm really tired today.

274
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,166
I bet I'm using
my brain too much.

275
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,666
Your brain?
I doubt it.

276
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,666
You couldn't stop yawning for
five seconds during class.

277
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,500
Just another
guess here, but uh,

278
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,750
do you think it's because
your familiar has been stuck

279
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,250
in physical form all day?

280
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,833
I bet she's using up a lot
of spiritual energy that way.

281
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,750
[NATSUME]
Good point.

282
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:08,958
If you think about it,

283
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,041
keeping that up all day
must be pretty hard.

284
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,958
It looks like we'll have to
take care of this weirdness

285
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,916
sooner rather than later.

286
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,166
[TOUJI] So do you guys wanna go
ask Mister Ohtomo about it then?

287
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,791
I wonder what they're
talking about.

288
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,166
I can't hear anything.

289
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,416
Does that sound good
to you, Natsume?

290
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,666
[NATSUME] Yeah.

291
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:29,000
[FEMALE STUDENT 11D]
Aahh! What the heck was that?

292
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,708
Something just
touched my foot!

293
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,125
[MALE STUDENT 11E]
Hey, I felt it, too!

294
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,541
[FEMALE STUDENT 11E]
Omigosh me too!

295
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,458
Whatever it is,
it's soft and fluffy!

296
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,416
[FEMALE STUDENT 11-1] Fluffy?

297
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,666
[MALE STUDENT 11F]
Whoa, dude!

298
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,041
There's definitely
something under the table!

299
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,208
There's what?

300
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,916
[FEMALE STUDENT 11-2]
It went that way!

301
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,708
Look! There!

302
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,041
[MALE STUDENT 11-1]
Was that a tiger?

303
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,458
[FEMALE STUDENT 11-3]
I dunno, but it was soft!

304
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,750
[FEMALE STUDENT 11-4]
There's a tiger in here? Aaahh!

305
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,333
[TOUJI] Anybody know
what's actually going on?

306
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,958
[NATSUME] No clue.

307
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,416
Well, that was
a big mistake!

308
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,833
And my embarrassment
is my master's.

309
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,458
At this rate, all the hubbub
I'm causing is gonna mean

310
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:05,583
big trouble for Master
Harutora, I just know it.

311
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,083
[TENMA]
Oh. Hey, Kon!

312
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,291
[KON gasps]

313
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,208
You're in physical
form today!

314
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,666
I think Harutora is
over in the cafeteria.

315
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,208
Should you even
be here, though?

316
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,166
[KON] Hah!

317
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,333
[TENMA chokes]

318
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,208
Please forgive me,
