1
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:36,208
[KYOKO]
We finally meet again.

2
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:39,500
I wonder if he's forgotten.

3
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,000
[KYOKO inhales]

4
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,000
[STUDENTS chatter]

5
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:46,250
[KYOKO] Forgotten about
the promise we made as kids.

6
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,541
Forgotten about me.

7
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:59,208
[KYOKO] Hey.
Long time no see, Natsume.

8
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:03,333
I don't suppose
you remember me?

9
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:07,125
[HARUTORA yells]

10
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:08,541
[KYOKO] Oh, shoot!

11
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:13,833
[HARUTORA yells]

12
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:20,541
Huh?

13
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:24,500
Master Harutora!

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's enough.

15
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:29,291
Kyoko.
You're the winner.

16
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:31,458
[KON]
Are you all right, Master?

17
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:33,791
[HARUTORA groans]

18
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,500
[KYOKO sighs]

19
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,208
[NATSUME] You cannot
honestly be that stupid.

20
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,083
Magic is extremely dangerous.

21
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,416
You need to try thinking!

22
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,416
[FEMALE STUDENT 5A]
Excuse us, boys.

23
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,666
[FEMALE STUDENT 5B]
We wanted to talk to Harutora.

24
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,500
You did?

25
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,041
Yeah, just
for a minute.

26
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,125
[HARUTORA] Oh, okay.

27
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,625
We thought yesterday's
match was amazing!

28
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,500
You were, like,
beyond impressive!

29
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,125
Yeah, I would've
been outta there.

30
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,333
For real, you were
up against Kyoko...

31
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,375
[HARUTORA] What's this?

32
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,000
[TENMA]
Morning, Harutora.

33
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,166
Hey, I didn't know you
had a defense familiar.

34
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,541
[HARUTORA] Yeah, well.

35
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,750
Oh, right!

36
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:44,875
Would you mind letting
us see that adorable

37
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,666
little creature again?
Pretty please?

38
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,500
Oh yeah, I want
to see her, too!

39
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:50,958
Kon.

40
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,041
[FEMALE STUDENTS yell]

41
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,333
She's so precious!

42
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,541
Tell me I
can pet her!

43
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,625
[KON] Help me!
Master Harutora, please!

44
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,916
[FEMALE STUDENT 5A]
She's so soft!

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,791
[FEMALE STUDENT 5B]
Oh! I love her!

46
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,208
[MALE STUDENT 5B] She's a kid.
You into little girls?

47
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,375
[HARUTORA] Huh?

48
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,833
Tell the truth.
Is that what you're into?

49
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,333
No! Not at all!

50
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,208
[MALE STUDENT 5C] Yeah,
wish my family was rich.

51
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,250
Maybe I could wave
around a wooden sword.

52
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,041
Play Onmyo Mage in class.

53
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,166
And hide behind
my defense familiar.

54
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:19,833
[KON] Yah!

55
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:20,833
[HARUTORA] Kon!

56
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:29,541
[KON growls]

57
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:33,541
What?
There a problem?

58
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:34,416
[HARUTORA] I'm sorry!

59
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,333
[STUDENTS gasp]

60
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:39,041
[HARUTORA] I get it; you're
way ahead of me right now.

61
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,666
But I'd really like
to do well here.

62
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,791
So, do you think we
can try and get along?

63
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,916
Uh. Yeah, sure.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,083
[FEMALE STUDENT 5A]
Whatever.

65
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,500
He can't even control
a simple familiar.

66
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,583
Hey, shut up!

67
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,916
I was just off that day,
and you know it.

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So you say, now,

69
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,791
but I remember it
being more than usual.

70
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,416
[MALE STUDENT 5C]
Everyone's like that at first!

71
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,291
[STUDENTS laugh]

72
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,791
Listen, all I'm saying,

73
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,458
is that I don't like you,
Tsuchimikado.

74
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,333
Your prerogative, man.
It's cool.

75
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,208
We don't have to
be best friends.

76
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,125
[huffs]

77
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,041
[HARUTORA] Hopefully you won't
all feel the same as him.

78
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,833
You can call me Harutora,
by the way.

79
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,333
[FEMALE STUDENT 5B] Okay.
We'll call you "Tsucchi," then.

80
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,041
[HARUTORA] Um yeah,
that's not what I said.

81
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,208
[STUDENTS laugh]

82
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,291
[TENMA] We're just
bustin' your chops, man.

83
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,500
[TOUJI]
Does it bother you?

84
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,625
Huh? Does it--?

85
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,083
No. No.

86
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,541
Y'know, it's kinda sad.

87
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,583
Over the summer a pretty
stubborn friend of mine

88
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,708
actually let herself get
into a fight with that idiot.

89
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:32,791
And in the end,

90
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,791
they never had the
chance to make up.

91
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,041
I'd hate to see something
like that happen again.

92
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,583
[KON] Let go!

93
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:42,458
[STUDENTS laugh]

94
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,125
[KON]
Master, help me!

95
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,625
[TOUJI sighs]

96
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,208
[WALLA: STUDENTS]

97
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,750
[MALE STUDENT 5D] What?
She said we could pet her!

98
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:00,833
[KYOKO] Huh?

99
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,000
[TOUJI]
Does it bother you?

100
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,458
[KYOKO gasps]

101
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,791
[HARUTORA]
Okay, what do you want?

102
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,833
I just wanted
to apologize.

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,708
I'm sorry we
ended up fighting.

104
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,000
Mister Ohtomo was the real
one I had a problem with,

105
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,750
not you, and it wasn't fair.

106
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,291
[HARUTORA]
O-kay. Well...

107
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,833
So anyway.

108
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:39,458
I wish the whole thing hadn't
turned into such a big deal.

109
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:42,208
[HARUTORA] Hmm...

110
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,833
So listen. I'm pretty
sure you're using me.

111
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,375
To make Natsume mad?

112
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,500
Which is totally fine,
I just have one question.

113
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:49,750
[KYOKO gasps]

114
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,333
[HARUTORA] How come?

115
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,625
I've met Natsume before.

116
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,750
It was a long time ago,
when we were kids.

117
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:58,750
Yeah?

118
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,333
It's not, like,
all that surprising!

119
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,125
The Kurahashi family
did used to be

120
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,208
a branch of the
Tsuchimikados.

121
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,416
Hold on.

122
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,833
Does that mean me and
you are, like, related?

123
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,208
Of course.
You seriously didn't know?

124
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,750
[HARUTORA] Uh, no.

125
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,791
So, did you guys fight when
you were little or something?

126
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,791
He forgot all about
me. Everything.

127
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,375
Um, I'm sorry.

128
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,666
You must have the wrong person.

129
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,250
[HARUTORA] That's not fair;
you only met once.

130
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,625
I know. But he made
a promise to me.

131
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,583
[HARUTORA] Like what?

132
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:32,833
It's dumb.

133
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:35,583
Hey. I have a question
for you, now.

134
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,791
Why'd he randomly start
wearing that ribbon?

135
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:38,958
Do you know?

136
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,708
Oh that--it makes him
look like a girl, huh?

137
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,666
I think it might be some
sort of magical family tool.

138
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,375
[KYOKO] That makes sense.

139
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,125
So I talked to
your friend Touji.

140
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,500
[HARUTORA]
'Bout what?

141
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,541
[KYOKO] About why you were
chosen to be a familiar.

142
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,666
Because of a tradition, right?

143
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,166
[HARUTORA]
I guess.

144
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,666
He told me that
you two were, like,

145
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,958
intimately connected
because of it.

146
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,625
Both body and soul.

147
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,416
Huh?!

148
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,708
[KYOKO] No. It's fine;
I totally get it.

149
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,250
Old customs are weird.

150
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,625
But being students,
things could--

151
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,208
[HARUTORA] Wait, wait,
wait! Please, wait!

152
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,875
Touji is evil and lies for fun!

153
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,291
My relationship with Natsume
isn't like that at all.

154
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,791
Seriously!

155
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:18,625
Like not yet?

156
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,125
No, like not ever!

157
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,791
We're just master and familiar;
that's all there is to it!

158
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,083
There are really no special
feelings or anything?

159
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,833
[HARUTORA] Of course not!
I'm not... into dudes!

160
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,291
So you're saying he
really only picked you

161
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,041
because you're a Tsuchimikado.

162
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,458
Well, actually.

163
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:38,041
I was the one who asked Natsume
to make me his familiar.

164
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,375
[KYOKO] What?

165
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,208
Sure, he's got the weight
of the Tsuchimikado name

166
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:44,458
on his shoulders, but it's not
like that's all he thinks about.

167
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:48,083
You really should give him
the benefit of the doubt.

168
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,583
Okay, fine!

169
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,083
Is that supposed
to make me feel

170
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,208
better about being
completely forgotten?

171
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,000
[HARUTORA] Look. Something
got mixed up somewhere

172
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,500
because that's not what
I was trying to say!

173
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,041
[NATSUME] What are
you doing here?

174
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,666
Why are you two
sneaking around together?

175
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,000
People will get
the wrong idea.

176
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,333
Hey, we're
just talking.

177
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:09,083
Yeah. We were making up.
Peace between friends!

178
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,083
[NATSUME] Really?

179
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,416
Really!

180
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,083
You know, I had no clue
that we're related to her.

181
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,375
But when I found out, I felt
bad about what happened.

182
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,500
So, we've been getting
to know each other.

183
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,041
How many times do
I have to tell you?

184
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,958
You are behind everyone
else in this school!

185
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,541
Whatever free time you have

186
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,541
needs to be used
better than this.

187
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,208
The last thing you
need to worry about is

188
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:31,125
sucking up to her or
other students in class!

189
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,250
Why can't you get
serious about this?

190
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,375
You're a Tsuchimikado, too!

191
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,166
You can't depend
on anyone else.

192
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,750
We have to focus so we
can become Onmyo Mages!

193
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,208
Do you understand
that we will fail

194
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,583
if we start counting on
other people to help us?

195
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:47,458
Yeah, it may be lonely,
but that's the way it is!

[TOUJI] What's up?

200
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,708
Not much. It's just
that Mister Ohtomo

201
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,875
asked me to give this
to Harutora for him.

202

Harutora!

210
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,541
What's going on?
You guys!

211
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,708
What the heck happened?

212
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,458
[MAGIC INVESTIGATOR 4A] You are
nothing more than a thug.

213
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:35,708
How dare you upset our
King of the North Star?

214
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,500
It is unacceptable!

215
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,750
King of the
North Star?

216
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:41,875
He means Yakou!

217
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:42,791
He's a devotee.

218
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,625
What the hell's going on?

219
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,708
Two days before you guys
enrolled in school,

220
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:50,000
one of Yakou's followers
attempted to kidnap Natsume.

221
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,083
What do you mean?

222
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,375
[TENMA] They broke in
and used magic

223
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,500
to try to abduct
him from his dorm.

224
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:55,708
Since that day,

225
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,166
he's had to undergo
questioning by the MIB.

226
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,375
Pretty much every day
between classes.

227
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:03,708
Oh. The special
training curriculum.

228
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm really glad you're here.

229
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,416
Everything he
was saying before

230
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,250
makes so much more
sense now, doesn't it?

231
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,000
He's already dealing
with the pressure of

232
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,291
taking over the
Tsuchimikado family.

233
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:17,958
On top of that, he's
attacked by crazy devotees.

234
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:21,416
So people believe he's
the reincarnation of Yakou.

235
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,166
No one wants to get too close.

236
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,333
And he can't get
close to anyone else,

237
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,208
not if he doesn't want
to put them in danger.

238
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,750
So he doesn't
have any friends,

239
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,791
because that way
no one can get hurt.

240
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,458
How did we not see it?

241
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:34,916
We're idiots!

[TENMA] Hey, Harutora!

243
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:40,291
Here. Mister Ohtomo told
me to give this to you.

be a magic investigator?

[MAGIC INVESTIGATOR 4A]
The King of the North Star

261
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:35,541
has many worshippers,
even in the Onmyo Agency.

My position is to
investigate magic crime.

That lets me experience the
depths of the onmyo itself.

264
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,708
You could even say
those of us at the agency

265
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:47,750
are most likely to
understand Yakou's greatness.

266
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,541
And, now,
I offer up myself.

I'm not Yakou; believe me!

Of course,
I must awaken you first.

protect you up until then.

Kakugyouki is

So, he should be an

They've all been defeated,
haven't they?

00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,625
Face the truth.

323
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,708
We're the only ones here
who are on your side,

324
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,750
and now is the time to admit it.

325
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,083
And if you don't,

326
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,250
I suppose we'll just
have to kill them all.

327
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,833
No, don't!

328
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,416
Please leave them alone.

329
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,583
Stop this.

[MAGIC INVESTIGATOR 4A]
Are you telling me

331
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,041
you admit the truth, then?

332

[HARUTORA] Forget about lame

Your real friends are here
right now, aren't they?

337

You don't have to
do this by yourself.

338

Remember, you're not alone,

339
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,333
so there's no reason to
be scared of that poser

would become my Hishamaru?

Yes.

349
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,833
Then you really
are delusional.

350
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,000
You're not worthy
to be Hishamaru!

I have the only familiar I need!

kill the brat!

Please, you have to
crush him into nothing!

suspicious during the fight.

Kakugyouki?

395

That he was
just a fake?

been like that at all.

Hey, back off,

406
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,041

Oh, about that.
I kinda need my notes back.

to stay up all night.

isn't coming over?

Does that bother you?

413
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:06,250
[KYOKO] Would you
stop asking that?

414
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,458
[KON] Master Harutora!

415
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,500
[HARUTORA] Huh?

00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,333
Ahh!

417
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,083
This one here.
That one over there.

Oh, hey!

00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,916
So, guess who's living
here starting today.

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,916
[HARUTORA] Whoa.

422
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,291
What, but this is
the boys' dorm?

423
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,166
Then that's where
I should be, right?

424
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,291
Right.

425
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,375
Don't forget you're
my familiar, too.

426
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,916
You have the responsibility
to protect me.

427
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,791
And that means
twenty-four seven.

428
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:38,916
What?

429
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,416
Are you kidding me?
That's impossible!

430
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,083
What's gotten into
you all of a sudden?

431
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,333
What was it you said?

432
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,541
I can rely on others?

433
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,125
[KYOKO] Natsume?

434
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,666
[NATSUME] Oh, hey guys.
What's up?

435
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,208
[TENMA whimpers]

436
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,833
[KYOKO] Seems like Natsume's
changed in the last few days.

437
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,375
[HARUTORA] He's not
easy to approach,

438
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:57,875
but as soon as he thinks
you're a friend,

439
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,000
he's pretty awesome.

440
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,333
[KYOKO] A friend.
You think so?

441
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,708
[HARUTORA]
What's wrong?

442
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,875
Oh, nothing.

443
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,166
I kinda have a crush on Natsume.

444
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,291
Oh, really?
Good to know.

445
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,541
Wait, what?!

446
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,083
I mean, yeah,
it sucks he forgot

447
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:16,666
about our promise,
but still, he's so cool.

448
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,708
And I think it's sweet
how naïve he is.

449
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,250
Not to mention that
he's cute and super nice.

450
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,125
So, now, this means that
you get to be the one

451
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,250
to help me start
dating him, Harutora!

452
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,750
Uh... Start dating?

453
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,666
But, there are kinda like
some special circumstances,

454
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,583
and weird traditions.

455
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,416
[HARUTORA] I can't tell her
Natsume's really a girl.

456
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,250
[KYOKO] Huh?

457
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,541
Ah ha.

458
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,375
Oh yeah, I get it.
You've fallen for me, first.

459
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,083
[HARUTORA] Huh?!
What are you talking about?

460
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,500
[KYOKO] I'm sorry,
but my feelings for him

461
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,583
aren't going to change.

462
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:48,083
So I'm gonna need your
cooperation on this, okay?

463
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50,166
Promise me that you're on board?

464
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:53,708
[HARUTORA] Wait.

465
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,916
[NATSUME] What are
you doing here?

466
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,125
[KYOKO giggles]

467
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,875
Hey, so, you didn't
hear that, right?

468
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,000
You know what,

469
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,458
I don't care who you
like or whatever.

470
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:09,125
Just don't forget you
have a job to do, okay?

471
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:12,625
No. You got it wrong.
Just let me explain.

472
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,208
When I said I don't care,
I meant that I don't care.

473
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:16,666
Either way, it
doesn't matter to me

474
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,083
because I totally don't care.

475
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,125
I don't care.

476
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:22,500
Yeah, I guess you don't,

477
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:23,875
that's why you
said it eight times!

478
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:24,875
[NATSUME]
It doesn't matter to me.

479
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,083
