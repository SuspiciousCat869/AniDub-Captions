00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:54,166
Well then.
What's eating at you?

164
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,416
[MUTOBE] Princess?

165
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,416
[TAKIKO] The time has come
for me to take action.

166
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,083
It'll be for their own good.

167
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,541
[MUTOBE] Whose?

168
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,750
[TAKIKO] You must have
noticed him as well.

169
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,333
I thought it was merely
a coincidence.

170
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:12,500
But he reacted to
the curse I cast.

171
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,916
I plan to break Yasuzumi
Tsuchimikado's spell.

172
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,333
And then I will awaken Harutora.

[TOUJI]
One armed man?

175
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,541
But how can we be sure
he's the real deal?

176
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,791
Well, if we take his talk
about the Raven Coat

177
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,416
and add it to him
specifically mentioning

178
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,208
Suzu Saotome by name.

179
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,166
And then you subtract one arm.

180
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,708
My money says
he's Kakugyouki.

181

[TOUJI] Hmmm.

182
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,083
Lemme guess.

183
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,791
Even with all that going on,
he was clueless.

184
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,416
Yo, Touji dude!

185
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Where are we
supposed to meet up?

Oh. Thank you.

want to get separated so.

With all that's happened,

there's plenty of stuff for us
to have to worry about, right?

That's why I think

you, me, Touji, Kyoko,

[KYOKO] Hey, Natsume.
Since it's just us today,

221
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,583
is it okay if I treat
you like another girl?

Uh, sure. I don't think
it'll be a problem here.

finally talk about boys

become comrades as well.
