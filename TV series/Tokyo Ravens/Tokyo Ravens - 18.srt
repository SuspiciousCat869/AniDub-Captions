00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,583
[distant door opens]

2
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:34,291
[HARUTORA] Natsume.

3
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:37,333
[gasps lighly] Huh?

4
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:40,291
[HARUTORA] Gotta admit, a little
weird seeing you like that.

5
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:43,458
[NATSUME] I can't imagine what
school will be like tomorrow.

6
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:45,833
[HARUTORA] Everyone's
probably heard by now.

7
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:48,041
Should make things
a little bit easier.

8
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,666
[NATSUME] Yeah,
I guess that's true.

9
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,125
I'm worried
about Kyoko, though.

10
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:52,750
[HARUTORA sighs]

11
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:56,125
[HARUTORA] Me too; we all
lied to her together.

12
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:59,958
Well, I guess the only thing
we can do is prepare ourselves.

13
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:02,083
[NATSUME]
Prepare ourselves? For what?

14
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,958
So we can face her
straight on

15
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:06,000
and start apologizing
non-stop.

16
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,666
It's a chance to
be real friends.

17
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,958
You know, the kind who don't
feel the need to hide the truth

18
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:12,166
or anything from each other.

19
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,500
You crack me up; you're
always so optimistic.

20
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,625
Yeah, that's the only thing
I've got goin' for me.

21
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,000
Do you really think so?

22
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:21,333
Hey, you were supposed
to contradict me there.

23
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:24,750
[HARUTORA and NATSUME laugh]

24
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,208
It's already been a year.

25
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:31,791
It still seems like
yesterday, though.

26
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,041
[NATSUME] Harutora, I--

27
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:34,208
[HARUTORA] Hm?

28
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:35,958
I've been meaning
to say, "thank you."

29
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:36,666
[HARUTORA] Uh?!

30
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,250
It's been a great year.

31
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,500
And I'm happy you got
to be here with me.

32
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:42,000
Uh...

33
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:44,291
I might not be exactly
dependable quite yet,

34
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,708
but I'm a pretty
decent familiar.

35
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:49,916
True!

36
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,625
[KON] M-Master Harutora.

37
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,791
I am terribly sorry to
interrupt this moment--

38
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:58,333
[HARUTORA] Kon?

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,708
It's... It's not t-technically
an urgent matter,

40
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:04,041
but it's important.

41
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,750
Kon. I'm really sorry.

42
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,750
It's my fault I kept
sending you spirit energy.

43
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,208
It's--It's all right.

44
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:44,458
My job as a familiar is to
receive my master's powers,

45
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,916
and, I'm, I'm
e-extremely grateful.

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,375
I'm still sorry.
It wasn't on purpose.

47
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,833
Not, on purpose? Oh no.

48
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,375
Begging your pardon,
but your magical power

49
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:57,500
is lacking much needed
stability, Master Harutora!

50
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,625
This is a very
serious matter, sir!

51
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,125
Nah, it's totally fine.

52
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,041
I'm keeping things
in check now, right?

53
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,416
Yes, Master.
But still!

54
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,875
[yawns]

55
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,625
Please stop stressing and
let me get some sleep today.

56
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,791
I gotta go back to school
bright and early, ya know.

57
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,250
G'night.

58
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,583
[TOUJI] Looks like
we were right, guys.

59
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,166
They're all staring at us.

60
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,041
The news about Natsume is out.

61
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,500
Hey!

62
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,166
[TENMA]
Good morning, everyone!

63
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,750
[NATSUME sighs]

64
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,083
Hey, bro.
How you doing?

65
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,916
I'm okay; thanks.

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,958
You went through
a lot, didn't you?

67
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,958
You're living in the boys'
dorm still, yeah?

68
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,208
But you're good?

69
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,750
Yes. People are keeping
their distance, though.

70
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:46,791
[laughs]

71
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,750
I'm sure everyone's
way confused,

72
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,708
but I'm glad it wasn't
too big of a deal.

73
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,083
Dude, Tenma!

74
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,500
I always thought you must
be a for real good guy,

75
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:55,750
and I was right.

76
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,958
Um. Calm down; I'm just
trying to be a friend.

77
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,666
You know. Guys like you
aren't easy to find, my man.

78
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,583
You should be
proud of yourself.

79
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,250
[TENMA] Come on, guys.
Back off.

80
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,625
I'm not comfortable
with all this touching.

81
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,916
Hey, I didn't see
you over there.

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,166
Yeah, poor thing was
waiting anxiously

83
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,791
by herself until I showed up.

84
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,458
I was not!
Don't tell lies, Four-Eyes!

85
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:18,541
For everyone's information.
I, like, just got here.

86
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:19,833
Whatcha got in
your hand there?

87
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:23,541
What? Well, this is
uh, oh, it's nothing.

88
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,416
[TENMA] Natsume, have your
parents said anything yet?

89
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,875
[NATSUME] Mhm.

90
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,166
Well, it's just her dad.

91
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,000
Natsume's mom isn't
really around anymore.

92
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,916
She doesn't talk to
her dad much, though.

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So she might be able to hide
it until after graduation.

94
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,291
I guess Kyoko's
the only one left.

95
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,291
[HARUTORA] Yeah.

96
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,791
[TOUJI] Good news:
starting today

97
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,500
we'll get to see each other
whether we like it or not.

98
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,250
Hooray.

99
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,208
So lame.

100
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,666
[NATSUME] Mm.

101
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,625
[STUDENTS gasp]

102

Tsuchimikado.

103
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,708
I wanna say
thanks for saving us

104
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,541
if you all hadn't been there,
I probably would have died!

105
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:09,625
Yeah, same here!

106
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,916
We seriously can't
thank you enough!

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,500
But it was our fault.

108
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,500
We're the only reason
you got involved.

109
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,750
And you kept us
from getting hurt,

110
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,166
so it's all good.

111
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,208
I can't believe it.

112
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,000
Thank you, everyone.

113
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,041
[TENMA chuckles]

114
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,833
She's gotta hate me.

115
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,958
[bells ring in distance]

116
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,958
[whimpers]

117
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,958
[HARUTORA]
Hey, hold up a sec.

118
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,000
Kyoko, wait!

119
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,125
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,541
[HARUTORA] I tried to
explain it in my text.

121
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,041
You know what Natsume is like.

122
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,458
It doesn't matter
how unreasonable

123
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:14,666
this whole thing was;
to her tradition is tradition.

124
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,666
But... we feel really
bad about tricking you.

125
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,083
We've been jerks.

126
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,916
Big time.

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So please, just
let us apologize.

128
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,875
[KYOKO] I told you.

129
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,750
I told you.
Don't you remember?

130
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:34,083
About how I met a boy at
Nastume's house as a kid?

131
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,458
And I said...
I liked him.

132
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,041
Do you remember
that at all?

133
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,250
Yeah. It was love at
first sight or something.

134
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,333
I know it's hard. I'm sorry.
But Natsume's a girl.

135
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:45,708
Yes, but I met a boy.

136
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:46,375
No...

137
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:47,875
And he was kind.

138
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:48,750
[HARUTORA] Uh.

139
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,166
I'll never forget that.

140
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,625
I was just some random,
annoying little girl.

141
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,916
[KYOKO] But he wasn't
bothered by me at all.

142
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,583
I asked him straight out
if he was a Tsuchimikado,

143
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,083
and he told me he was.

144
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:02,625
Say what you will; I know the
kid I talked to was a boy.

145
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,541
I'm sorry.
But there's some mistake.

146
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,375
You really mean it, you'll
look for my ribbon for me?

147
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,041
Yeah.
At least, I'll try.

148
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:24,458
Alright! You made me a promise.
Pinky swear you won't forget!

149
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,541
[KYOKO] It's not fair.

150
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,583
And I was planning
to apologize, too.

151
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:41,375
I can't believe all the
things I said to him.

152
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,875
I'm sure he remembers, now.

153
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,041
[KYOKO] This is the worst.

154
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,916
[SUZUKA]
You are bumming me out.

155
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,500
[KYOKO]
Oh, hey, Suzuka.

156
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,000
[SUZUKA] I'm gonna
need you to stop.

157
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,833
Your lame sadness is starting
to make me feel bad, too.

158
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:01,166
So like, what is wrong
with you today anyway?

159

00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,875
[CHIZURU gasps]

318
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,083
[CHIZURU] But how?
The barrier is...

319
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,291
It has not been taken down.

320
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,416
She looked at its construction
and rendered it ineffective.

321
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,250
[CHIZURU]
In that split second?

322
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,458
I am a barrier
expert, after all.

323
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,875
I would prefer it if you
could sit there quietly,

324
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,500
"Human Power Generator."

325
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,500
[CHIZURU] It can't be helped.
May I Yasuzumi?

326
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:16,958
[YASUZUMI]
Try to be gentle.

327
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,541
[CHIZURU grunts]

328
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:30,083
Electricity is coming
directly out of her body!

329
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,208
Is it a familiar?

330
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,666
That is correct!

331
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,958
[CHIZURU] Nou maku
san manda bonadan.

332
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,833
Indoraya sowaka!

333
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,291
[MARI grunts]

334
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,541
Don't underestimate me!

335
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,875
[CHIZURU] What?

336
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,458
Huh? What's this?
Some kind of barrier?

337
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:04,083
With a Divine General
for an opponent,

338
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,333
winning with a frontal
attack will be difficult.

339
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,791
[CHIZURU] Then why
don't you, I don't know,

340
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,166
try helping me out?

341
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,416
[YASUZUMI] This is not
the time for me to fight.

342
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,416
In these situations,

343
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,583
my familiars are
extremely capable.

344
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,041
[TAKAHIRO]
Chizuru's right, you know.

345
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,541
[MARI gasps]

346
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,375
You should put a little
effort into this thing, too.

347
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:21,458
Takahiro!

348
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:24,208
Sorry I'm late.
Made it in time, though.

349
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,916
[MARI] Impossible!

350
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:36,000
[MARI] Om bishi bishi
kara kara shibari sowaka!

351
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,041
A familiar?

352
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,958
[TAKAHIRO] You should
be able to move now.

353
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,875
And who are you?

354
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:50,666
[TAKAHIRO] Just a simple
country Onmyo doctor, ma'am.

355
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:56,250
[MIYACHI] Well, looks
to me like you're stuck.

356
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,833
It's not terribly surprising
considering the fact

357
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,791
you're facing the whole
Tsuchimikado family.

358
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,416
What? Miyachi!

359
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,541
[creaking]

360
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,833
[MIYACHI] You can
do better than that.

361
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:11,083
How can you greet a former
colleague so rudely?

362
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,666
Commander, I...

363
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,375
I gotta say,
good work, Maririn.

364
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,375
Please don't call
me Maririn, sir.

365
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,208
[MIYACHI] It's been
a while, you three.

366
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,833
Haven't changed a bit.

367
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,541
Presumptuous,
don't you think?

368
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,833
Even for a Miyachi.

369
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,041
[MIYACHI]
Come on now,

370
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,375
we can be friendlier
than this, can't we?

371
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,916
[CHIZURU] Why are
you showing up now?

372
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,833
After so much time,
why not just let it slide?

373
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,666
[MIYACHI] Now, don't
be so unreasonable.

374
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,500
You really haven't changed.

375
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:36,625
Miyachi, tell me,
you're fine with this?

376
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,083
[MIYACHI] Hmm...

377
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,875
Why, am I not supposed to be?

378
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,083
To be honest with you,

379
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,958
even I'm not on the
chief's side this time.

380
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,375
[TAKAHIRO] It certainly
appears as though

381
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,083
you've become rather dignified.

382
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,666
[MIYACHI]
Much obliged for that.

383
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,250
Now then, do you think you
can give me what's in the box?

384
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,625
Oh no, that would
be impossible.

385
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:55,500
Takahiro.

386
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:56,875
Got it. We get
to do something

387
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:59,291
death-defying for the first
time in quite a while.

388
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,208
[MIYACHI] Maririn,
do you think you could

389
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,125
strengthen the barrier
around this area?

390
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,458
Uh.

391
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,000
The last thing I'd want is
to trouble the neighbors

392
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:09,208
by burning everything in
this vicinity to the ground.

393
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,208
[phone rings]

394
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,208
[MIYACHI] Thank you
for your patience.

395
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:18,500
The Raven Coat is
now in my possession.

396
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,166
[OHTOMO] So you're saying
Yasuzumi Tsuchimikado's

397
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,250
whereabouts are unknown?

398
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,958
[KOGURE] Yes.

399
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,666
Anything from MIB?

400
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,125
[KOGURE]
Well, about that.

401
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,250
Considering how unsettled
they should be right now

402
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,791
with their director missing,
they're doing strangely well.

403
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:34,958
[OHTOMO] What the hell?

404
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,541
Yeah, those guys
are acting on orders

405
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:40,000
without knowing a single thing
about them. It's bizarre.

406
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,416
One more thing, Jin.

407
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,416
I get how you feel, but don't
go off on your own here.

408
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,416
[OHTOMO] Yeah, sure.

409
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,375
[phone clicks]

410
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,916
Uh--

411
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,791
[door creaks]

412
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:52,041
[exhales shakily]

413
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,541
[OHTOMO sighs]

414
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:56,791
I'm kind of a coward,

415
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,166
so can you please try
not to scare me, Master?

416
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,625
[OHTOMO] Thanks.

417
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,041
[DOMAN] Ah-woo!

418
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,666
[chuckles]

419
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,875
You decided to be
a child this time?

420
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,125
You have to have known
that's in rather poor taste.

421
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,625
[DOMAN] There are
various conditions

422
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,708
that need to be met
to be my host.

423
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,666
For the record,
I haven't done anything.

424
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,875
Not, yet.

425
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,458
Wonderful.

426
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,750
And what is it that brings you
to my room this fine evening?

427
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:21,791
[DOMAN laughs]

428
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,291
What do you think?

429
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,708
[OHTOMO] I don't know,
but I'm praying

430
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,041
you're not
here for revenge.

431
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,333
[DOMAN]
How regrettable.

432
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,166
Do you truly think
I would bother doing

433
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,500
something so
completely boorish?

434
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,750
It's the opposite, actually.

435
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:34,916
[OHTOMO] Which means?

436
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,583
[DOMAN] I came to
answer to the winner.

437
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:38,958
If someone bested me and

438
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,916
didn't receive anything
in return for their victory,

439
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,708
then my name would
become obsolete,

440
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,708
and we can't
have that, can we?

441
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,625
Onmyo mage, Jin Ohtomo,

442
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,041
what is it you would
like me to do for you?

443
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,583
Well, for the time being,

444
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,666
do you think you could
perhaps withdraw?

445
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,791
But if that's not possible,

446
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,916
just quietly stay
inside for a bit?

447
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,375
Boring!

448
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,541
You know those things are
hardly acceptable requests.

449
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:00,916
[OHTOMO sighs]

450
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,458
Well, Master, mind if I
ask you a question please.

451
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,666
The blast that was responsible
for blowing away your old body.

452
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,541
Was it the work of the
Twin Horn Syndicate?

453
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,791
[DOMAN] Most likely.

454
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,291
They wanted to keep me
from spilling secrets.

455
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,416
Then, I imagine it
would be safe to assume

456
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,375
you've parted from their
company at this point,

457
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:17,041
is that correct?

458
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,291
[DOMAN] It is.

459
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,083
I have no duty toward
those fools any longer.

460
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,166
Does that mean you
don't mind telling me

461
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,625
who's behind Twin Horn?

462
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,041
Because I'd really like to
know who that might be.

463
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,833
The collar on the
Twin Horn Syndicate

464
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,041
is very connected
to the Onmyo Agency,

465
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,250
although to be fair.

466
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,041
I bet you were already
aware of that fact.

467
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,083
[OHTOMO sighs]

468
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,541
This is fun; ask me
something else!

469
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:38,791
[OHTOMO] Okay.

470
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,666
Why did you want
the Raven Coat?

471
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,916
Oh, I just wanted that because
my disciple requested it.

472
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,291
Disciple?

473
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,000
That's right,
and, surprise,

474
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,000
she has somewhat of a
history with you, Jin.

475
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,791
Her name is Suzu Saotome.

476
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,041
Yes indeed.

477
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,958
Tell me, is she doing
all right these days?

478
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,458
[DOMAN] She's already left.

479
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,041
It seems she doesn't need me
anymore, so I don't know.

480
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,875
How impertinent.

481
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,125
Okay.

482
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,625
Let us leave it at that
for tonight, shall we?

483
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:06,791
I'll see you soon, though;

484
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,750
this conversation
is not nearly enough

485
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,125
to reward you
for your victory.

486
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,625
Oh no, it's plenty.

487
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,500
Why don't we agree that
I still owe you one anyway.

488
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,708
If you have something you
want to ask me in the future,

489
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,125
all you have to do is call.

490
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,916
And I promise to lend you
my power if you need it.

491
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,916
Uh, Master. I have to
say I'm a little afraid

492
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,500
that you are actually
trying to curse me.

493
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:26,833
[DOMAN laughs]

494
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,083
The fact you
truly believe that

495
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,541
is evidence of your
twisted personality.

496
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,666
Now, give me your
mobile telephone.

497
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,708
[DOMAN] I'm going to put
my number in it for you.

498
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,083
You have a cell phone?

499
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,416
Yeah. Of course.
Who doesn't?

500
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,666
Don't you find with the
technology nowadays,

501
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,250
it seems like only
a matter of time

502
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,583
[DOMAN] before our
magic will be obsolete?

503
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:46,666
Catch!

504
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,000
Well, when you say it,

505
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,833
it's difficult not to
believe that's the case.

506
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,083
[laughs]

507
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,625
We're two men
behind the times.

508
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:57,625
We should try to get along from
now on, wouldn't you agree?

509
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,375
Oh, man.

510
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,041
[MALE REPORTER 18A]
No bodies or remains

511
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,500
were found in the ashes,

512
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,208
and there has still
been no contact with

513
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,833
the owner of the building,
Yasuzumi Tsuchimikado.

514
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:12,125
The authorities so
far have no leads.

515
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,458
[KYOKO] Natsume's family home
burned to the ground,

516
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:19,791
and I don't even know
how she's dealing.

517
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,041
Enough.

518
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,000
[TAKIKO] Excuse me.

519
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:26,333
I was planning to go to Natsume
Tsuchimikado's classroom.

520
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:28,708
Do you think you can
show me where he is?

521
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:31,500
Okay?
Have we met before?

522
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,208
[TAKIKO]
We haven't yet, no.

523
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:36,166
Very nice to meet you;
I'm Takiko Souma.

524
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:08,875
Recommendation.

525
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:10,875
Right between the ears
is the sweet spot okay!
