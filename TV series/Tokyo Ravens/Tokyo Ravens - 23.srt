No matter what the

I cannot simply turn a blind
eye to forbidden magic.

330

As their teacher,
I'm sure you agree with me.

bringing out Doman
Ashiya, aren't you?

337
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:19,791
I can't believe you had that
much mistrust in the agency.

338
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,250
You didn't mention it
to me, but I get that,

I figure you respected
my position.

340
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,333
All you wanted was
to free your student.

341
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,458
And once you got yourself
on that wanted list,

342
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,583
everything would be resolved.

343
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:35,291
Your unrelenting consideration
is irritating per usual.

[KOGURE] Harutora.

346
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,791
Forbidden magic is a game,

347
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,416
a game that uses the
world as collateral.

348
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,916
What? A game?

349
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,875
If you win, the reward
will be great,

350
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:50,250
but if you lose, you risk
sacrificing the rest of us.

351
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,833
The damage won't stop with the
mage who performed the spell.

352
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,375
Innocent people could be hurt.

353
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,916
Even if you win the game,

354
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,333
forbidden magic will
destroy your body.

355
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,375
It's like poison.

356
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,666
It will gnaw away at the mage.

357
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,250
Gnaw away at his heart.

358
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,791
Your teacher over there
knows this all too well,

359
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,208
