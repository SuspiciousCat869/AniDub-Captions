only choose that path

321
00:15:11,188 --> 00:15:13,421
God of the Southern
Sea called Kyojou!

322
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:15,555
God of the Northern Sea
called Gukyou!

323
00:15:15,588 --> 00:15:18,788
[OHTOMO] Dispel a hundred
demons and exorcise disaster!

324
00:15:19,855 --> 00:15:21,888
Order!

325
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,821
Oh, the Night Parade
of a Hundred Demons,

326
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:26,655
Imperial style.

327
00:15:26,688 --> 00:15:27,521
[grunts]

328
00:15:27,555 --> 00:15:29,821
[DOMAN] What?
Wait, is that a curse?

329
00:15:29,855 --> 00:15:32,521
Why is there a
woven bamboo cage?

330
00:15:32,555 --> 00:15:34,821
I offer the green of
leaves from a bamboo tree,

331
00:15:34,855 --> 00:15:36,488
and with their withering
goes the life that

332
00:15:36,521 --> 00:15:37,488
has sustained them.

333
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:38,988
[OHTOMO] With the ebb
and flow of these tides,

334
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,621
so shall you ebb and flow!

335
00:15:40,655 --> 00:15:43,455
With the sinking of
this rock, be engulfed!

336
00:15:45,188 --> 00:15:46,221
[DOMAN] It can't be!

337
00:15:46,255 --> 00:15:49,788
Now I see why you used
the Marici mantra earlier.

338
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:51,388
You were planning
to use the talisman

339
00:15:51,421 --> 00:15:54,055
on the woven cage!
I should've known!

340
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:58,021
[DOMAN] But how could I
have known you would use

341
00:15:58,055 --> 00:16:01,088
such antiquated props. It's
hard to believe there are

342
00:16:01,121 --> 00:16:05,621
still such ancient curses
left in the Imperial style.

343
00:16:05,655 --> 00:16:08,055
I have to say,
I'm very impressed!

344
00:16:08,088 --> 00:16:10,555
Even I don't know how
to reverse this curse.

345
00:16:10,588 --> 00:16:12,521
I suppose if the connecting
point is reversed,

346
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:13,788
then the spell can be erased.

347
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:15,855
But I can't reach
your connecting point,

348
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:19,055
and there's no way to reverse
a one-sided magical cage.

349
00:16:19,088 --> 00:16:21,588
What a nasty piece of work!

350
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:23,921
[laughing]

351
00:16:23,955 --> 00:16:26,821
Time to go old school!
I'll just use brute force

352
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:29,121
to overpower it
like a barbarian!

353
00:16:34,855 --> 00:16:37,155
[KON] Ah...!

354
00:16:37,188 --> 00:16:39,688
His energy is unreal.

355
00:16:40,888 --> 00:16:44,955
[HARUTORA] It's giving
me chills. So much power!

356
00:16:46,021 --> 00:16:49,355
[OHTOMO] Ban un taraku,
kiriku aku!

357
00:16:50,988 --> 00:16:53,588
Return! Aaah!

358
00:16:56,821 --> 00:16:58,755
No!

359
00:16:58,788 --> 00:17:05,955
[OHTOMO reciting spell]

360
00:17:05,988 --> 00:17:09,421
[MIYO] No! Please, Mister
Ohtomo, don't do this!

361
00:17:09,455 --> 00:17:12,521
[OHTOMO groans]

362
00:17:12,555 --> 00:17:18,888
[OHTOMO continues]

363
00:17:21,855 --> 00:17:22,721
Be careful!

364
00:17:22,755 --> 00:17:24,121
Zan dari han!

365
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:38,121
[ALL gasp]

366
00:17:40,055 --> 00:17:44,021
[breathing heavily]

367
00:17:45,188 --> 00:17:46,855
I knew it.
But now I finally

368
00:17:46,888 --> 00:17:48,821
have the proof I needed.

369
00:17:48,855 --> 00:17:51,621
[OHTOMO] You are
not human at all.

370
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:53,088
You're a rogue ghost.

371
00:17:53,121 --> 00:17:54,155
Heh.

372
00:17:54,188 --> 00:17:55,955
[DOMAN] This reckless
plan of yours was all for

373
00:17:55,988 --> 00:17:59,121
the sake of proving that
a theory was correct?

374
00:17:59,155 --> 00:18:01,021
[DOMAN] What fun!
I cannot tell you

375
00:18:01,055 --> 00:18:02,988
how delightful this is for me!

376
00:18:03,021 --> 00:18:05,455
I am completely
entranced by you.

377
00:18:05,488 --> 00:18:07,855
Honestly, I haven't felt
this way since Yakou!

378
00:18:07,888 --> 00:18:09,155
[chuckles]

379
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:10,855
What's your name, son?

380
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:12,055
[OHTOMO] I'm Jin Ohtomo.

381
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:15,455
I see. Well,
Onmyo mage, Jin Ohtomo,

382
00:18:15,488 --> 00:18:18,155
thy magic was truly
a splendid experience!

383
00:18:18,188 --> 00:18:21,721
Wilt thou join me,
and fight at my side?

384
00:18:21,755 --> 00:18:24,788
[DOMAN] Magic is genuinely
profound and beautiful.

385
00:18:24,821 --> 00:18:27,755
You seem like someone who
understands that truth.

386
00:18:27,788 --> 00:18:30,088
Why stop at taking
a peek into the depths

387
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:34,388
of magic when, with me,
you can throw yourself in?

388
00:18:34,421 --> 00:18:36,088
Oh, what ecstasy!

389
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:37,821
It is pure rapture.

390
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:40,855
Rapture beyond anything
you'll ever know.

391
00:18:43,588 --> 00:18:45,055
[OHTOMO] Apologies, sir.

392
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:46,521
Hm?

393
00:18:46,555 --> 00:18:48,721
I must refuse
your generous offer.

394
00:18:48,755 --> 00:18:50,055
I know it may seem otherwise,

395
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,655
but I am not desperate
enough to believe

396
00:18:51,688 --> 00:18:53,721
the sweet talk of
a dried up old man.

397
00:18:53,755 --> 00:18:55,988
[DOMAN laughs]

398
00:18:56,021 --> 00:18:57,821
How righteous you are!

399
00:18:57,855 --> 00:19:00,655
But I will not
forgive you, Jin Ohtomo!

400
00:19:00,688 --> 00:19:04,455
Watch me shatter that holier
than thou head of yours!

401
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,955
Check it out!
Those're Swallow Whips!

402
00:19:09,988 --> 00:19:11,721
Damn you, Ohtomo!

403
00:19:11,755 --> 00:19:13,488
[DOMAN] You dare to
use ready-made spells

404
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:14,855
against me?

405
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:17,555
After all your boasting
and grandiose displays,

406
00:19:17,588 --> 00:19:20,621
now you wish to make
a mockery of this match?

407
00:19:20,655 --> 00:19:22,021
[OHTOMO] I've heard
it said that the need to

408
00:19:22,055 --> 00:19:25,955
do everything yourself
is a form of narcissism.

409
00:19:25,988 --> 00:19:27,721
Unlike geniuses
throughout history,

410
00:19:27,755 --> 00:19:29,955
the rest of us normal folk
have our normal ways

411
00:19:29,988 --> 00:19:32,655
of doing things. Relying
on something man-made

412
00:19:32,688 --> 00:19:34,155
happens to be
one of those ways,

413
00:19:34,188 --> 00:19:36,155
though perhaps you
wouldn't understand.

414
00:19:36,188 --> 00:19:37,821
And, you know,
to tell the truth,

415
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,821
[OHTOMO] I never cared much
about competing with you

416
00:19:39,855 --> 00:19:41,621
in the first place.

417
00:19:44,555 --> 00:19:46,055
[DOMAN] What are
you trying to do?

418
00:19:46,088 --> 00:19:48,388
[OHTOMO] I am merely
thinking like a human.

419
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,155
If my opponent is
like a spirit disaster,

420
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:51,855
then I need only deal
with him as I would

421
00:19:51,888 --> 00:19:53,721
any intruder
from the other side.

422
00:19:53,755 --> 00:19:55,421
You enjoy your
little games, Doman,

423
00:19:55,455 --> 00:19:58,155
but announcing your
attack was your downfall.

424
00:19:58,188 --> 00:19:59,688
[grunts]

425
00:19:59,721 --> 00:20:04,921
[distant chanting]

426
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:07,721
[HARUTORA] Wait,
are those signal fires?

427
00:20:07,755 --> 00:20:09,055
[chanting continues]

428
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:10,488
What? You didn't!

429
00:20:10,521 --> 00:20:12,588
Yeah. I know
it was kinda rude,

430
00:20:12,621 --> 00:20:15,388
but I'm not one to
leave things to chance.

431
00:20:18,888 --> 00:20:21,688
I know this. It's the
Yamantaka method!

432
00:20:27,621 --> 00:20:29,555
[ALL gasp]

433
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,655
[DOMAN yells]

434
00:20:32,688 --> 00:20:34,388
I may have
misjudged you, Ohtomo,

435
00:20:34,421 --> 00:20:36,455
but you are still
too weak for me!

436
00:20:36,488 --> 00:20:38,388
You'll have to do
better than this, my boy!

437
00:20:38,421 --> 00:20:40,788
Your Yamantaka method
is a little bit sloppy.

438
00:20:40,821 --> 00:20:43,521
There's a distortion in the
convergence of the magic!

439
00:20:43,555 --> 00:20:46,588
[DOMAN] What you have just
isn't enough to exorcise me!

440
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:47,988
[OHTOMO] Om, aku, un!

441
00:20:51,488 --> 00:20:52,855
[DOMAN groans]

442
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:56,921
Help him!

443
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,488
Hokuto!

444
00:21:03,021 --> 00:21:04,688
[ALL] Mister Ohtomo!

445
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,121
[HARUTORA] Are you okay!

446
00:21:09,921 --> 00:21:10,921
[OHTOMO sighs]

447
00:21:10,955 --> 00:21:13,888
I think I'm done.

448
00:21:13,921 --> 00:21:15,655
Guys, he's alive!

449
00:21:15,688 --> 00:21:17,988
Man, that dude fights
like a crazy person.

450
00:21:18,021 --> 00:21:21,621
[DOMAN] Didn't I tell you
this just isn't enough?

451
00:21:23,888 --> 00:21:25,688
I don't believe it.

452
00:21:27,921 --> 00:21:30,955
[DOMAN] So admirable;
you drew me away in order

453
00:21:30,988 --> 00:21:33,388
to protect your students.

454
00:21:33,421 --> 00:21:35,755
You got close.
Too bad, though.

455
00:21:35,788 --> 00:21:38,088
You drove me this far,
only to have it all end

456
00:21:38,121 --> 00:21:40,955
not as a brilliant mage,
but as a teacher.

457
00:21:40,988 --> 00:21:43,455
That must be terribly
tragic for you.

458
00:21:43,488 --> 00:21:45,488
Oh, it's not that bad.
You're right.

459
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:47,921
Being an investigator
was always exciting.

460
00:21:47,955 --> 00:21:49,621
And I was quite
good at some of it.

461
00:21:49,655 --> 00:21:50,955
But, honestly,
I'm better with people

462
00:21:50,988 --> 00:21:52,588
[OHTOMO]
than spirit disasters.

463
00:21:52,621 --> 00:21:53,655
Huh?

464
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,455
Well, I guess you know
the old saying, don't you?

465
00:21:55,488 --> 00:21:58,088
Something clever about
to every man his trade?

466
00:21:58,121 --> 00:22:00,155
[OHTOMO] I left it all to
those with the talent for it.

467
00:22:00,188 --> 00:22:01,788
Like him.

468
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,788
[KOGURE] Namu. Tengu great
and small, umana tengu,

469
00:22:04,821 --> 00:22:06,388
tengu by the thousands.

470
00:22:06,421 --> 00:22:07,655
First of the great tengu:

471
00:22:07,688 --> 00:22:09,988
Atagoyama Taroubou,
Hirasan Jiroubou.

472
00:22:10,021 --> 00:22:12,888
Kuramayama Soujoubou,
Hieizan Houshoubou.

473
00:22:12,921 --> 00:22:15,855
[KOGURE] Yokokawa Kakukaibou,
Fujisan Daranibou!

474
00:22:15,888 --> 00:22:17,688
One hundred twenty
five thousand!

475
00:22:17,721 --> 00:22:19,888
Altogether, with tengu
appearing in every place,

476
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,988
I call on the
demons to disperse!

477
00:22:22,021 --> 00:22:23,888
[KOGURE] Request complete!

478
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:28,421
Om, hira hira ken,
hira ken nou sowaka!

479
00:22:28,455 --> 00:22:31,121
[yells]

480
00:22:31,888 --> 00:22:35,021
[groans]

481
00:22:35,055 --> 00:22:38,121
[yells]

482
00:22:40,521 --> 00:22:42,455
[ALL wince]

483
00:22:42,488 --> 00:22:43,888
Hell yeah!

484
00:22:48,921 --> 00:22:50,721
Looks like that's
the end of him.

485
00:22:50,755 --> 00:22:52,655
[KOGURE] See you, Doman.

486
00:22:52,688 --> 00:22:55,755
Yes. I do suppose
I've finally lost.

487
00:22:59,955 --> 00:23:02,755
We have a few
questions we'd like to ask.

488
00:23:02,788 --> 00:23:04,488
[KOGURE] If you surrender
quietly and agree to

489
00:23:04,521 --> 00:23:05,988
have your magic restrained,

490
00:23:06,021 --> 00:23:09,488
I can personally guarantee
the safety of your spirit.

491
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:10,788
Oh, that's right.

492
00:23:10,821 --> 00:23:14,055
The loser must answer
to the winner, now.

493
00:23:20,488 --> 00:23:21,421
Mister Ohtomo!

494
00:23:21,455 --> 00:23:22,921
Kogure!

495
00:23:26,621 --> 00:23:27,588
[HIRATA] I never
would have figured

496
00:23:27,621 --> 00:23:30,621
schoolteacher Jin Ohtomo
was such a skilled mage.

497
00:23:30,655 --> 00:23:32,121
[HIRATA] I would have
preferred another outcome,

498
00:23:32,155 --> 00:23:33,621
but I'll have to
be satisfied with

499
00:23:33,655 --> 00:23:36,355
keeping Ashiya's lips sealed.

500
00:23:38,488 --> 00:23:40,588
[SUZU] I humbly
present myself.

501
00:23:40,621 --> 00:23:44,755
I am here for the Taizan
Fukun god of the afterlife.

502
00:23:47,621 --> 00:23:49,421
This is terribly
demeaning.

503
00:23:49,455 --> 00:23:53,055
After all, I'm not a
familiar, I'm a disciple.

504
00:23:55,155 --> 00:23:56,055
[SUZU] Oh, come on.

505
00:23:56,088 --> 00:23:59,021
At least let it be
a young girl in there.

506
00:24:00,855 --> 00:24:03,088
Rock! Paper! Kon!
