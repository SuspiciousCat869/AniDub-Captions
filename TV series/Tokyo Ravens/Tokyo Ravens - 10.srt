00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,000
[TOUJI] The spirit
disaster created by

2
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:39,208
the Twin Horn Syndicate that
day was painstakingly purified

3
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:42,041
and the government declared
a state of emergency.

4
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,291
The incident was called

5
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,458
"The Second Purification
of the Dolls Festival,"

6
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:48,125
and the news ran with the
story for days afterwards,

7
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:51,958
reporting non-stop about
the widespread effects.

00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:53,833
[TOUJI]
A month after that...

00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,500
[MIYO]
To all our new students,

10
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:58,583
welcome to Onmyo
Preparatory School.

11
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,916
My name is Miyo Kurahashi,
and I am the principal here.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,958
There are a lot of new
kids starting this year.

13
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,166
Fun to get some fresh meat.

14
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,458
Uh huh.

15
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:07,916
Hope they know how
important the first day is.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,416
Uh oh. I know that tone.

17
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,416
You're gonna go all delinquent
and scare em, huh?

18
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,666
Be quiet.

19
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,291
And would you stop looking
around like an idiot?

20
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:17,166
At this time, why don't
we hear a few words

21
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,166
from a representative
of the new students?

22
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,833
I'm sure they'll
all be very brave,

23
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,625
and, of course, terribly strong.

24
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,750
Not to mention fashionable.

25
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,000
At least they
better be, because

26
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,750
the judgment around
here is strong.

27
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:29,791
Yeah, from you.

28
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:31,166
Just don't do any
permanent damage

29
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,166
to their delicate psyches.

30
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,041
Oh, for the last
time, shut up!

31
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:35,916
This is Miss
Suzuka Dairenji.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,416
You might know her
as the Prodigy.

33
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,958
[ALL THREE] Huh?

34
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:44,833
[SUZUKA inhales]

35
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:47,500
Nice to meet everyone
this beautiful morning!

36
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,833
My name is Suzuka Dairenji.

[applause]

38
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,250
[HARUTORA, NATSUME, and TOUJI]
What?

39
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,791
My name is
Suzuka Dairenji.

00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,916
[applause]

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,916
[HARUTORA, NATSUME, and TOUJI]
What?

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,791
My goodness.
Thank you.

43
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:34,583
I've been so nervous about
speaking up here today.

44
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,500
You shut your
ugly mouth!

45
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,166
But I'm happy to be here!

46
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,291
There are just
far too many bugs!

47
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,291
I've always had
a secret dream.

48
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:47,125
To practice magic
with other kids my age.

49
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,666
And this year,
I'm finally able to do that.

50
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,416
And I'll have to
cut off your balls!

51
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,250
[SUZUKA giggles]

52
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,666
Thank you for helping
my dream come true!

53
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,041
[HARUTORA groans]

54
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,166
Right. Dream come true.

55
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,875
More like nightmare.

56
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,875
[TOUJI] Vulnerable smile.

57
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,208
Profile, 38 degrees
to the right.

58
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,833
Which is a completely
calculated angle.

59
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,333
That girl knows
exactly how to pose

60
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,083
to look as cute
as humanly possible.

61
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,458
Wonderful! I'm so glad
you're impressed!

62
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,041
I don't get it.

63
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,166
What the hell is going on here?

64
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,708
[HARUTORA] Aw, crap!

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,125
[HARUTORA] Yeah, definitely her.

66
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,291
No doubt.

67
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,291

68
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,666
[SUZUKA] Oh, my!

69
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,083
Did I see you out
there, Harutora?

70
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,833
[audience gasps]

71
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:39,916
[MIYO] You did.

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,708
Now, how do you
know him, my dear?

73
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,750
[SUZUKA] How?

74
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,541
Oh, well, he was the first
boy that I ever kissed.

[HARUTORA whimpers]

78
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,333
[KYOKO] You were the
Prodigy's first kiss?

79
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:01,375
You went to a lame, normal
school with lame, stupid kids.

80
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,416
How and where did you meet
someone as amazing as Suzuka?!

81
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,666
Ugh!

82
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,083
[HARUTORA] Calm down,
you're turning all red.

83
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,666
Of course
I'm turning red!

84
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,833
This whole absurd story
is practically killing me!

85
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,708
There were special
circumstances, okay?

86
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,500
No, it is not okay!

87
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,166
That girl is the face
of the Onmyo Agency,

88
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,500
an idol in this world.

89
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:21,208
And she has the skills
to back it up.

90
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:24,000
I mean, honestly, she's who the
rest of us are trying to be!

91
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,875
[HARUTORA] Seriously?

92
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,125
So fess up!

93
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,416
Why on Earth would she
kiss someone like you?

94
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,916
Nothing personal,
but you're a loser

95
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,541
from a pretty
scandalized family!

96
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,208
On top of that, why?

97
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:37,791
Why would she make you her
once-in-a-lifetime first kiss?

98
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,750
That's just weird! Don't you
think it's weird? It's weird!

99
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,625
Maybe you could tell us all the
details to help us understand!

100
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:44,916
Yeah, spill it, loser!

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,750
Are you two like
totally going out?

102
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,166
Did you do more
than just kiss?

103
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,208
[squeals and laughter]

104
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,500
[KON] You better watch it!

105
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,375
Keep on yapping, and I'll bite!

106
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:55,666
It's okay, Kon.

107
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,083
There's no reason to get upset.

108
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,458
We're not attacking
him or anything.

109
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,500
[KON] I can feel your
thirst for blood, lady!

110
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,375
But don't you
wanna know why?

111
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,375
You see, one of the
Twelve Divine Generals

112
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,208
kissed Harutora for some reason.

113
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,750
Do you know what a kiss is?

114
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:08,958
[KON] No...

115
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,083
It's when lips touch
and smooching happens.

116
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,333
Smooch?

117
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,666
[HARUTORA] Kon, not you too!

118
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,875
Hey, Touji!

119
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,750
You guys went to the
same school, didn't you?

120
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,000
You know anything?

121
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,291
Kinda.

122
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,708
I hadn't heard about
the kiss, to be honest.

123
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,375
But let me think.

124
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,458
Must've happened the
night of the festival.

125
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,750
[squeals]

126
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,625
[HARUTORA] You are
such a bastard!

127
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,708
[NATSUME] Excuse me.

128
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,541
[NATSUME] I need a minute.

129
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:45,166
Let's talk, Harutora.

130
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,791
[OHTOMO] Seriously, what could
the Onmyo Agency be thinking?

131
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,541
Why do they insist on foisting
the Prodigy off on us?

132
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,541
Let me guess. It's her penalty
for what happened last year?

133
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,625
Correct. She had
special circumstances.

134
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,041
Apparently, her family life

135
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,000
left her with a shortage
of common sense.

136
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,458
At least, that's what
they're saying.

137
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,750
[OHTOMO] And of course, if
something were to happen now,

138
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,375
they'd want to take
care of it quickly.

139
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:13,166
So this school was the best
choice for her re-education.

140
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,791
Yeah. That's pretty much it.

141
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,541
"D" is keeping us
fairly busy on our end.

142
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,208
[OHTOMO sighs]

143
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,625
Well, Suzuka is officially
one of our students now.

144
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:27,083
I don't know what the Agency
is expecting from us, exactly.

145
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,666
But at the very least
we'll be sure to take

146
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,000
good care of the girl
while she's with us.

147
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,625
You sound like you care.

148
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,750
That's kinda cool.

149
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:37,166
Cool, huh?
It's my job.

150
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,125
[HARUTORA] I told you,
it wasn't a normal kiss

151
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,791
or anything like that!

152
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,875
I mean, technically if
you had to have a name

153
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,791
for what it was--I guess--

154
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,500
Yeah, it does sorta fit the
description of a first kiss.

155
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:49,708
But not a real one!

156
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,291
Seriously, there
weren't any feelings

157
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,541
or anything behind it, I swear!

158
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,750
[NATSUME] I don't care
about the stupid kiss.

159
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,000
Aren't you
forgetting something?

160
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,500
That she's seen me?

161
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,500
I was there with you last
summer, and I met her too.

162
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,875
[NATSUME inhales]

163
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,291
She knows the
truth about me.

164
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:10,541
I was dressed as a priestess--
a girl--the whole time!

165
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,208
[NATSUME] All I could think
of during the assembly

166
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,041
was to use an invisibility
spell and keep hidden.

167
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:19,083
But at this rate, I'm done
for when she sees me.

168
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,666
[HARUTORA]
Don't you worry.

169
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,791
I'll go talk to
her after school.

170
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,416
[HARUTORA]
What, she went home?

171
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,625
When?

172
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,875
[FEMALE STUDENT 10A]
Oh, she like just left.

173
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,083
[FEMALE STUDENT 10B]
I'm bummed; I was hoping

174
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,750
we could walk home together.

175
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:33,958
[FEMALE STUDENT 10A]
Yeah, even getting the chance

176
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,583
to talk to her was hard.
She was surrounded!

177
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,500
Well, thanks for
letting me know.

178
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,791
[FEMALE STUDENT 10A]
Oh my gah!

179
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,250
You're the boy that
kissed her, right?

180
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,625
So what, are you like
exes or something?

181
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,458
[HARUTORA] No, she's really
just an acquaintance.

182
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,125
You paused for a sec!
What does that mean?

183
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,875
You at least know her
well enough to kiss her!

184
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,125
[squeals and giggles]

185
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,500
[HARUTORA groans]

186
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:58,000
This morning had to be her sick
and twisted version of payback.

187
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,958
Even so, I can't believe she
said I was her first kiss!

188
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:05,541
[KON] So then, what she said
about you was really true?

189
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,875
[HARUTORA] Please, Kon, I don't
wanna talk about it anymore.

190
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:11,291
But don't you think that girl is
a little too young for you, sir?

191
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,916
How could you kiss
her to start with?

192
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,041
Look, I couldn't move!
She forced herself on me!

193
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,291
I didn't have a choice, okay?

194
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,958
What do you mean
forced on you?

195
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,833
I mean it's a
misunderstanding!

196
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,000
So you don't have any
feelings for her, then?

197
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:29,083
No, of c-c-course I d-don't!

198
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,166
What's up?

199
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,500
[HARUTORA] Who is that?

200
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,583
I didn't notice her at all.

201
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,958
[SUZU] A little girl.

202
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:47,958
[HARUTORA] What?

203
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,166
[SUZU] It's a little girl.

204
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,666
Little-- Hold on.
You talking about Kon?

205
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,791
It's a little girl fox.

206
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,083
She's a cute little
girl fox, too.

207
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:01,291
Yeah. She's my
defense familiar, too.

208
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,583
Cool, huh?

209
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,041
[SUZU] She's a cute
little girl fox familiar?

210
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,708
[HARUTORA]
What is her deal?

211
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:12,416
I suppose this means that
you're Harutora Tsuchimikado.

212
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,375
Wait, how do you
know who I am?

213
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,958
Oh right, because of the
assembly this morning.

214
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,083
I did not attend
assembly this morning.

215
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,500
Okay. So how
do you know me?

216
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,041
[HARUTORA] Alrighty, you're
starting to weird me out now.

217
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,833
Who the heck are you, anyway?

218
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:29,208
Who the heck I happen
to be is your senior.

219
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,333
Like a third year?

220
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,416
Oh, uh, I apologize
if I was rude.

221
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,333
[SUZU] You did it
because I'm small.

222
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,958
No, not really.

223
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,250
[SUZU] Because I look
like a little girl.

224
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,541
I said that wasn't it!

225
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,333
I understand. People often
mistake me for one.

226
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,708
You mean cause you look like a
first year? Not that you do.

227
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,958
I look very young.
It makes sense to me.

228
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,916
Well, don't worry about
it because I don't think

229
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,083
you look anything
like a little girl!

230
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,375
[SUZU] Hmph.

231
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,875
[HARUTORA]
Does that mean she's mad?

232
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:59,125
Okay, so did you need me
for something, or what?

233
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:02,125
I saw the little girl,
so I came over.

234
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,541
[HARUTORA]
Are you for real?

235
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,666
You're into little
girls that much?

236
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,416
[SUZU] No, it's not that.

237
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,916
I knew the son of the
Tsuchimikado branch family

238
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,250
had a familiar like her.

239
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,666
[SUZU] What's that?

240
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,750
What's what?

241
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,583
Oh yeah, that's
kind of a long story.

242
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:25,708
It's a spell.

243
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:26,875
[SUZU] It looks weird.

244
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,958
Well, I didn't ask you!

245
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,750
[HARUTORA]
Is she laughing now?

246
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,708
[SUZU] I'll see you around.

247
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,291
Just go home already!

248
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,333
[HARUTORA] Not here, either.

249
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,833
What kind of little
girl has a thing

250
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,666
for other little
girls? It's weird.

251
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,166
[SUZUKA]
Hey, Lolita Complex!

252
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,458
[HARUTORA] It's you!

253
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,416
[SUZUKA] Still got the same
stupid look, huh?

254
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,958
Don't stare at my
pigtails like that,

255
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,666
or people will get
the wrong idea.

256
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,125
Or maybe the right one?

257
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,375
I'm not staring!

258
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:54,625
I don't even care.

259
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,250
What I really want to know is,

260
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,500
how difficult was my very
special announcement

261
00:11:58,583 --> 00:11:59,541
this morning for you?

262
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:00,750
It was awful.

263
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,416
And I'm sure that's
exactly what you wanted.

264
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,666
That's what you get!

265
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,000
You little brat!

266
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,416
Why do you have to be
so damn fake all the time?

267
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,041
Um, obviously, I have to
think of my public image.

268
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,625
Of course, your image.

269
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:14,208
So out with it, tell me the real
reason you were enrolled here.

270
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,333
[SUZUKA] I don't get
why I should have to

271
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,291
talk to you about that.

272
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,791
Oh, don't be defensive.

273
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,250
I mean, I was your
first kiss, right?

274
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,958
Darling.

275
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,041
[SUZUKA sighs]

276
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,500
[SUZUKA] It's my
punishment. My penalty.

277
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,666
[HARUTORA]
Because of last year?

278
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,708
If everything had gone
according to plan,

279
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,291
I wouldn't even be
in this world anymore.

280
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:39,291
But thanks to
somebody, I'm here.

281
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,708
It's pitiful, isn't it?

282
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,041
Well, I dunno.

283
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,083
Seems like it was a good
thing somebody was there.

284
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,625
[SUZUKA grunts]

285
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,291
[HARUTORA]
What about your brother?

286
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,916
Did you get a chance
to bury him properly?

287
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,416
[SUZUKA] 
Mm-hmm.

288
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,166
That's good.

289
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,958
So, this penalty,
how long's it last?

290
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,625
Three years?
That's nothing.

291
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,375
Ah, they let you off a whole
lot easier than they could've.

292
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,250
[SUZUKA] What?
Are you stupid?

293
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,708
[HARUTORA] What's that?
Is it a spell?

294
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,166
Yeah.

295
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,125
They did it to seal
away my magic.

296
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,333
[HARUTORA] Whoa.

297
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:20,000
Well. No biggie;
it's only temporary.

298
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,208
And it's not like I couldn't

299
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,541
take you down
with my eyes closed!

300
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,416
[HARUTORA] Okay, okay.

301
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,583
Are you still worried about
what happened that night?

302
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,500
[SUZUKA] Huh! For real,
self-centered much, are we?

303
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,041
Oh wait, new topic!

304
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,875
Where's the next head of
the Tsuchimikado family?

305
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,750
If Natsume is still taking
classes in a place like this,

306
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,416
he's no rival of mine.

307
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,166
[HARUTORA] She doesn't know
who Natsume really is yet.

308
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,666
Speaking of which,

309
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,375
I don't think I've ever seen
Natsume Tsuchimikado before.

310
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,916
So you should
introduce me to him.

311
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
What?

312
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,833
[SUZUKA]
I'm counting on you, Darling.

313
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,916
[HARUTORA] Oh, great.

314
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:07,583
[SUZUKA] Just kill me
and be done with it.

315
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,416
I murdered your friend, right?

316
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,208
So kill me.

317
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,375
[HARUTORA]
Don't say things like that.

318
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:17,416
If you died now, there'd be
no one to mourn your brother.

319
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,041
[SUZUKA] Even though
you were an enemy,

320
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,958
you saved the life
I had thrown away.

321
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:32,416
And now I need to
turn into a new me.

322
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,250
But how?

323
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,958
[SUZUKA] How could I?

324
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,208
I killed her.

325
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,125
[murmuring]

326
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,208
A disguise?

327
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,166
Don't judge me; you're
the one who was stupid!

328
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,041
Her magic being
sealed is a plus,

329
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,416
so we've got that, at least.

330
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,333
If anything, it'll be harder
for her to see through

331
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,333
the fake version of
Natsume since it's magic.

332
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,958
Besides, no matter
how amazing she may be,

333
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,333
try to remember
she's still just a kid.

334
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,916
And she's not completely
heartless either.

335
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,458
[SUZUKA] Harutora!

336
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,250
Good morning, how are you!

337
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,250
She's here!

338
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,875
Better make
yourself invisible.

339
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,916
[HARUTORA]
Oh, hey there, Suzuka.

340
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,541
It's been forever!

341
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,416
[SUZUKA]
Whatcha talkin' about?

342
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,125
We met yesterday after school.

343
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,833
You're always so silly.

344
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,375
Wait a sec.

345
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:31,291
Was that supposed to be a secret
just between the two of us?

346
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,291
Oh no, I'm sorry!

347
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,958
[HARUTORA] Uh.
So did you need something?

348
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,625
Oh no, I just think it's lame
not being able to see you

349
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,333
even though we go
to the same school.

350
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,416
I wanted to see
your face and say hi.

351
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,208
So, hey there, mister!
I just can't see you enough!

352
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,666
[HARUTORA] Thank
you. That's very sweet,

353
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,125
but you didn't need
to come all the way

354
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:54,083
to the second-year classroom
just to tell me that.

355
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,125
Get out of here!
It's totally for real!

356
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,250
Good for you, buddy!
I wish I could be that bold!

357
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,791
You rock!

358
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,625
[HARUTORA] Will you
stop doing that?

359
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:02,666
[SUZUKA]
I can't help it.

360
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,333
The first-year
classroom is boring.

361
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,833
[HARUTORA]
Then try making friends!

362
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,958
How could I do that?
I'm too good for them.

363
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,916
I'm far too good for you, too!

364
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,416
I'm sure if you looked you
could find someone tolerable.

365
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,208
[SUZUKA]
No way. Too tiring.

366
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,666
Yeah. That's because
you don't know

367
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,250
how to act like a real person!

368
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:21,000
Let go.
You're hurting me.

369
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,291
[HARUTORA]
Oh. Sorry.

370
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,166
I have a question.

371
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,125
Natsume Tsuchimikado.
He's in your class, right?

372
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,666
What? Yeah, maybe,
I mean, at least I think so.

373
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,166
You're not
making any sense.

374
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,208
Which one is he?
I want you to introduce us.

375
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,125
Hey, wait, slow
your roll a second.

376
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,750
Today's not a good day.

377
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,250
Now, who is this person again?

378
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,166
[SUZUKA] What?
Do you have brain damage?

379
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,291
Stupid-tora.

380
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,833
[SUZUKA] Harutora!

381
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,958
Do you wanna eat
lunch together today?

382
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,208
It's invisibility time.

383
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:57,750
You need to memorize the
books from here to here

384
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,208
by the end of the day.

385
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,500
You're kidding me, right?
When am I supposed to sleep?

386
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,541
[SUZUKA] Harutora!

387
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,083
Invisible.

388
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,416
Aw, what do you
think you're doing?

389
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,875
Those books are too hard.

390
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:11,208
They're totally
wrong for you, silly.

391
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,958
[HARUTORA] What?
You think so?

392
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,500
[HARUTORA chuckles]

393
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,208
[SUZUKA] Harutora!

394
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,750
Get going.

395
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,083
Hey there.

396
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,291
My goodness, what a mess!

397
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,166
[NATSUME] I can't
take it anymore.

398
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,833
My body won't last.

399
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,916
[HARUTORA] Yeah.
Mine either.

400
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,541
My brain's fried, too.

401
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,166
I think the only option you have

402
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,041
is for Harutora to
tell her the truth.

403
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,416
You think?
Why me?

404
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,750
Face it, man.

405
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,166
You're the only one
she might listen to.

406
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,583
[SUZUKA hums]

407
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,500
Look who it is!
Hey, Harutora, honey!

408
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,291
Where have you been hiding?

409
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,625
I wasn't hiding.

410
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,000
Actually, I've been looking
everywhere for you!

411
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,041
Really?

412
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,125
C'mon, let's go for
a walk, darling.

413
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,666
[SUZUKA]
Wait, where are we going?

414
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,166
Harutora just
made a major move.

415
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,041
Yes, he did! They're basically
a for-real couple now!

416
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,625
A couple.
Like, a "couple"!

417
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,166
[KYOKO] I can't! I can't
even! I just can't!

418
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,125
[HARUTORA]
What's wrong?

419
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,791
[SUZUKA] What?
Nothing's wrong, stupid.

420
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,583
[HARUTORA] Huh.
Wonder if she gets out much.

421
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,291
[SUZUKA] Hm? Ugh,
stop doing that.

422
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,875
Whatever you're thinking, I'm
sure it's super disrespectful.

423
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,416
Ooh, perceptive.

424
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,083
If you wanna know the truth,
I was thinking,

425
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,125
"You know what, this kid's
still pretty cute."

426
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,625
How annoying! You're not
that much older than me.

427
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,625
Tell me, how are you
liking Onmyo Prep?

428
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,500
I said stop it.
You're being all condescending!

429
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,875
Why aren't you hanging out with
any of the kids in your class?

430
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,416
They're boring,
that's why.

431
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,041
Fine. But I'm sure you must
know some interesting people.

432
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,708
Shut up. You're starting
to sound like an old man.

433
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,958
You better hurry up and eat
that, or it's gonna get cold.

434
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,000
[HARUTORA laughs]

435
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,666
Here you go.

436
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,416
I could have done
that for myself!

437
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,666
Of course you could.

438
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,250
I'll cut them off!
Don't think I won't!

439
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,166
[HARUTORA] Why put on a show?

440
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,000
You should just act like
yourself at school.

441
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,916
[SUZUKA] I told you, I have
to keep up my public image.

442
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,708
Does your image as
a Divine General

443
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,250
really mean all
that much to you?

444
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,208
Because I don't think it should.

445
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,416
[HARUTORA] What happened
with your brother is over

446
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,750
and you're at a
different school now.

447
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,208
It's a fresh start.

448
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,541
You might even find
a new you, ya know?

449
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:39,833
Hey, I'm sorry.

450
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,291
That was kinda
inconsiderate of me.

451
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,833
My bad.

452
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,500
So, like, um...

453
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,708
Why--Why don't you
seem to resent me?

454
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,250
Resent you?
Why would I?

455
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,375
[SUZUKA] Because of what
happened to that familiar!

456
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,458
I completely obliterated her.

457
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,583
I don't understand how
you can be nice to me

458
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,875
after I did that to you.

459
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,291
[HARUTORA] I get it.

460
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:06,416
She's been stressing
the whole time.

461
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,875
This is the turning point.
I can't get this wrong.

462
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,333
There's no need for lies.

463
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:16,041
[HARUTORA] Don't be stupid.

464
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,500
I'm bugged about that
enough for us both.

465
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,041
Besides, I was the
one who was a coward.

466
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,791
I think it's best if
we put that behind us.

467
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,375
What about you?

468
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,583
You might've been going about
it wrong, but it was our fault

469
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,666
that you ended up not being
able to see your brother.

470
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,666
[HARUTORA] It must
be unbelievably hard,

471
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,833
knowing that you'll
never have him back.

472
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:40,083
I can't even imagine
how awful that is.

473
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,000
[SUZUKA] It's terrible.

474
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,375
It really is.

475
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:51,708
[HARUTORA] For what it's worth,
it's not like Hokuto's dead.

476
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,125
It's a funny story.

477
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,916
Yes, she's a familiar,
but she was created

478
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,458
with a different sort of spell.

479
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,083
Basically, someone
was controlling her

480
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,708
from the outside.

481
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,500
What? You mean remotely?

482
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,666
That's impressive.

483
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,791
[HARUTORA]
Yeah, I guess someone made her

484
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,333
to become friends with me.

485
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:10,000
And that person is
probably still around.

486
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,375
That's one reason
I started school here.

487
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,750
I thought maybe I would get the
chance to meet whoever it was

488
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:18,250
that controlled Hokuto.
Pretty crazy, huh?

489
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,541
[SUZUKA] What the hell?

490
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:20,916
Huh?

491
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,750
[SUZUKA] That's pretty
freaking annoying, you know.

492
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,625
Why bring me here
and preach at me?

493
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,750
What do you think you'll gain?

494
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,958
Okay. What are you saying?

495
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,583
I'm saying this.

496
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:35,208
When I decide who the new me is,
it'll be my choice, got that?

497
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,750
So you can stop spying
on me, you creep!

498
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,750
Your invisibility spell has
been too weak this whole time!

499
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,333
[NATSUME yells]

500
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,375
Natsume?

501
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,083
What the heck are
you doing here?

502
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,500
Natsume?

503
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,041
What?

504
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,250
[SUZUKA gasps]

505
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,500
She's that priestess!

506
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,250
All right.

507
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:00,166
Finally, things are gonna
start to get fun around here.

508
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,791
Good morning, darling!

509
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,000
I hope you're having
a good day so far!

510
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,750
[HARUTORA]
Oh. Hey there.

511
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:09,916
What's wrong, dear?

512
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,500
You're looking a little
bummed out today.

513
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,666
Are you Natsume
Tsuchimikado, by chance?

514
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,000
[NATSUME] Mm-hmm.

515
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,083
[SUZUKA] Why, I could not
be happier to meet you!

516
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,541
The truth is...

517
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:24,208
I've been wanting to be
introduced to you forever.

518
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:25,625
[TENMA] Those two are
destined to be friends.

519
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,125
After all they're both geniuses

520
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:29,083
and birds of a feather
flock together, right?

521
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,125
What an amazing moment!

522
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:33,958
[SUZUKA] Oh, I think we are all
going to be very best buddies.

523
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:35,041
Don't you guys agree?

524
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,458
[NATSUME and HARUTORA whimper]

525
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,416
[NATSUME and HARUTORA]
This is gonna be a nightmare.

526
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:10,166
I'll cut off your balls!

527
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:10,958
Chop! Chop!
