00:00:19,766 --> 00:00:21,333
[HARUTORA] The Doman
Ashiya attack on

2
00:00:21,366 --> 00:00:23,166
the Onmyo Prep School
came to a close

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,200
with a mysterious explosion.

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,333
[HARUTORA] Mister Ohtomo was
quickly taken to the hospital.

5
00:00:29,366 --> 00:00:30,700
The damage from the
battle could be seen

6
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:32,466
all over the school.

7
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,266
[HARUTORA] In the end,
the Raven Coat targeted by

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,700
Doman had already
been taken away

9
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:41,033
by Natsume's father,
Yasuzumi Tsuchimikado.

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,233
[HARUTORA] While repairs are
being made at the school,

11
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:46,766
we're to report
to the Meguro branch

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,666
of the exorcism department.

13
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,366
The idea is for
students to continue their

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,100
magic training while
surrounded by professionals.

15
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,566
[HARUTORA] I've never
seen such raw power.

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,566
It's hard to believe
any of us survived that.

17
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:05,233
I'll be that
strong. Someday.

18
00:02:38,203 --> 00:02:39,341
[grunts]

God of the Eastern Sea,

Of the Western Sea, Shukuryou!

[ALL gasp]

God of the Northern Sea,
called Gukyou!

[HARUTORA]
Gods of the Four Seas.

26
00:02:56,808 --> 00:02:59,508
Dispel a hundred demons,
and exorcise disaster!

27
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:01,475
Kon! Now!

28
00:03:03,775 --> 00:03:05,608
Order!

29
00:03:08,308 --> 00:03:10,275
Master Harutora,
he's gone!

30
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,908
Did I do that?

31
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,475
[KON] There!

32
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:16,575
Order!

33
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,875
[ETOU] Om bishi bishi
kara kara shibari sowaka!

34
00:03:23,508 --> 00:03:25,008
[HARUTORA] Eh--ahhh!

35
00:03:25,042 --> 00:03:26,975
Stop! That's enough!

36
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,942
I'm coming, sir!
Just hold on!

37
00:03:32,642 --> 00:03:34,008
[grunts]

38
00:03:34,908 --> 00:03:37,308
Big shocker.

39
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,542
[HARUTORA]
I can't do it like he did.

40
00:03:42,508 --> 00:03:43,808
Are you hurt, Master?

41
00:03:43,842 --> 00:03:44,808
There was no
need for you to use

42
00:03:44,842 --> 00:03:47,642
a spirit disaster
counter spell against me.

43
00:03:47,675 --> 00:03:48,942
If you don't even
know the basics,

44
00:03:48,975 --> 00:03:50,608
don't be a copycat.

45
00:03:50,642 --> 00:03:52,608
Take it easy now, Etou.

46
00:03:52,642 --> 00:03:54,775
[ETOU] I thought it was
a bad idea from the start.

47
00:03:54,808 --> 00:03:56,575
But you were insistent.

48
00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:58,308
Learn your place, kid.

49
00:03:58,342 --> 00:04:00,442
You're not ready to
train with the pros, yet.

50
00:04:00,475 --> 00:04:02,308
Give it a few years.

51
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,642
[snarls]

52
00:04:04,675 --> 00:04:05,942
These "pros"
you're talking about

53
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:07,742
couldn't handle their own jobs.

54
00:04:07,775 --> 00:04:09,442
And now we're at the
point where students

55
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:11,775
are using your
facilities to train.

56
00:04:11,808 --> 00:04:13,842
When the surprise
attack came to our school,

57
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,608
[NATSUME] where were
you "pro" exorcists?

58
00:04:15,642 --> 00:04:17,642
You certainly
weren't helping us.

59
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,308
--[KON grunts]
--Natsume.

60
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,675
Burn.

61
00:04:21,975 --> 00:04:23,508
[NATSUME] I'm proud of
you for trying so hard

62
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:25,308
in training, Harutora.

63
00:04:25,342 --> 00:04:27,975
Regardless,
Etou was too strong.

64
00:04:28,008 --> 00:04:30,275
[KON] Uh... With all
deference, Master,

65
00:04:30,308 --> 00:04:32,408
I am of the same opinion.

66
00:04:32,442 --> 00:04:34,675
[NATSUME] Harutora?

67
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,475
[HARUTORA] They were
amazing, weren't they?

68
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:37,542
The two of them.

69
00:04:37,575 --> 00:04:38,475
Two of whom?

70
00:04:38,508 --> 00:04:41,975
You know. Mister Ohtomo
and... and Doman.

71
00:04:42,008 --> 00:04:45,308
[NATSUME] So you're
still hung up on that? Ugh.

72
00:04:45,342 --> 00:04:48,008
What? Sorry. I guess
I kinda spaced out.

73
00:04:48,042 --> 00:04:50,475
Never mind. It's fine.

74
00:04:52,742 --> 00:04:54,842
[HARUTORA] Natsume.
That altar that was

75
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,342
on the school's roof?

76
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,575
[HARUTORA] It was exactly
the same as the one

77
00:04:57,608 --> 00:04:59,675
from out in the
country, am I right?

78
00:05:01,608 --> 00:05:04,708
So what do you say?
Should we go check it out?

79
00:05:05,808 --> 00:05:09,808
[KON] I-I'll take point, sir.
Please allow me to lead the way!

80
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,375
[HARUTORA] Thank you, Kon.

81
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:15,808
[HARUTORA] What a mess.

82
00:05:15,842 --> 00:05:18,042
I'm amazed we
even survived this.

83
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:19,775
[NATSUME] Yeah, if Mister
Ohtomo hadn't shown up

84
00:05:19,808 --> 00:05:21,942
when he did we might not have.

85
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:25,808
[KON gasps]

86
00:05:25,842 --> 00:05:26,808
What is it, Kon?

87
00:05:26,842 --> 00:05:29,708
[KON] T-There's someone
at the altar, Master.

88
00:05:34,075 --> 00:05:35,375
Who's there?

89
00:05:35,408 --> 00:05:36,842
We're students who
go to this school.

90
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,808
Just taking a look around.

91
00:05:39,842 --> 00:05:41,942
[HARUTORA] Look, it's
pretty dark up here, yeah?

92
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:44,342
I'm just going
to add some light.

93
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,442
Kon. Flames.

94
00:06:03,308 --> 00:06:05,542
Tsuchimikado.

95
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:07,008
[chuckles lightly]

96
00:06:10,608 --> 00:06:12,842
[GIRL] You're
Natsume Tsuchimikado.

97
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:16,375
Then that must make you
Harutora Tsuchimikado, right?

98
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:17,808
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

99
00:06:17,842 --> 00:06:19,842
My name is Takiko Souma.

100
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:22,375
I'm a student like you.

101
00:06:22,408 --> 00:06:25,308
Studying to become
a real Onmyo mage.

102
00:06:25,342 --> 00:06:26,942
[HARUTORA] When I think
back to that night,

103
00:06:26,975 --> 00:06:28,942
it was such a
strange encounter.

104
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:32,575
[HARUTORA] Then again,
odd encounters

105
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:34,608
happened to us all the time.

106
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:42,908
[YASUZUMI] So it begins.
The stars have crossed.

107
00:06:42,942 --> 00:06:45,342
[NATSUME] Takiko... Souma?

108
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,842
[TAKIKO] Yes, that's right.

109
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,708
To think I'd actually
get to meet you in person!

110
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:53,008
If this is all a dream,
then please don't wake me up!

111
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:53,908
Uh...

112
00:06:53,942 --> 00:06:56,275
So then, you must
be new at the school

113
00:06:56,308 --> 00:06:57,808
or something, is that
right Miss Souma?

114
00:06:57,842 --> 00:06:59,742
Please, just call me Takiko.

115
00:06:59,775 --> 00:07:03,308
They've arranged some special
enrollment just for me.

116
00:07:03,342 --> 00:07:05,275
That a fact?

117
00:07:05,308 --> 00:07:07,475
Which is why we
haven't met before.

118
00:07:07,508 --> 00:07:08,775
Such a shame!

119
00:07:08,808 --> 00:07:10,442
Oh. Right on.

120
00:07:10,475 --> 00:07:11,608
[clears throat]

121
00:07:11,642 --> 00:07:13,342
So then, Takiko.

122
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:16,542
If you don't mind me
asking, why are you here?

123
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:18,875
The same reason as you
guys are here, I'd bet.

124
00:07:18,908 --> 00:07:21,342
I came to see
the heavenly altar.

125
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,575
[HARUTORA] "Heavenly altar."

126
00:07:23,608 --> 00:07:25,375
I didn't know
that was its name.

127
00:07:25,408 --> 00:07:28,042
So... you came all the
way up here to see this?

128
00:07:28,075 --> 00:07:29,642
[TAKIKO] That's right.

129
00:07:29,675 --> 00:07:31,775
Do you have any idea
what it actually takes

130
00:07:31,808 --> 00:07:33,708
to put this ritual
altar to use?

131
00:07:33,742 --> 00:07:34,642
Of course not!

132
00:07:34,675 --> 00:07:36,275
[TAKIKO] An amateur
like me could never

133
00:07:36,308 --> 00:07:37,975
understand
the heavenly altar.

134
00:07:38,008 --> 00:07:40,042
After all, this altar
is the essence

135
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:41,742
of Tsuchimikado magic.

136
00:07:41,775 --> 00:07:43,408
They say it's the
greatest legacy left

137
00:07:43,442 --> 00:07:45,442
by Abe no Seimei!

138
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:47,575
Some say that even
Yakou himself didn't fully

139
00:07:47,608 --> 00:07:49,775
understand everything
about this altar.

140
00:07:49,808 --> 00:07:51,975
I see, you are aware
of the ceremony

141
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:53,575
that takes place
here, though.

142
00:07:53,608 --> 00:07:56,875
You mean the Taizan
Fukun Ritual? Naturally.

143
00:07:56,908 --> 00:07:58,942
Isn't the Taizan Fukun
Ritual supposed to be

144
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,708
a secret of the
Tsuchimikado family?

145
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:03,908
Why don't you tell us
who you really are?

146
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,975
Like I already said,
I'm a fellow student.

147
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:10,475
I'm studying to
become an Onmyo Mage.

148
00:08:10,508 --> 00:08:11,775
[TAKIKO] I can't say
much more than that,

149
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:13,375
or else I might
get in trouble.

150
00:08:13,408 --> 00:08:14,642
I'll give you a hint.

151
00:08:14,675 --> 00:08:16,308
Why do you think
the heavenly altar

152
00:08:16,342 --> 00:08:17,808
is here in the first place?

153
00:08:17,842 --> 00:08:20,842
Onmyo Prep used to serve
as Yakou's private academy.

154
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,642
[BOTH gasp]

155
00:08:21,675 --> 00:08:23,775
They called it
the Yakou School.

156
00:08:23,808 --> 00:08:25,575
Open to those with aptitude,

157
00:08:25,608 --> 00:08:29,675
it circumvented antiquated
concepts like bloodlines.

158
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:33,042
You might even say
the alter was his legacy.

159
00:08:33,075 --> 00:08:34,942
[TAKIKO] You should
ask Principal Kurahashi

160
00:08:34,975 --> 00:08:36,908
for more details
on the whole shebang.

161
00:08:36,942 --> 00:08:38,542
I mean, she was part of it.

162
00:08:38,575 --> 00:08:39,642
She was part of what?

163
00:08:39,675 --> 00:08:41,442
She's the one who
turned Onmyo Prep

164
00:08:41,475 --> 00:08:43,275
into what it is today.

165
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:45,775
Tsuchimikado found her
when she was really young.

166
00:08:45,808 --> 00:08:47,308
She was a charter
member when the

167
00:08:47,342 --> 00:08:49,308
Yakou school
was first founded.

168
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:50,808
[gasps]

169
00:08:50,842 --> 00:08:52,875
He liked to play shogi.

170
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:55,242
Although, he wasn't very good.

171
00:08:56,608 --> 00:08:58,908
[TAKIKO] Some of Yakou's
personal records from that time

172
00:08:58,942 --> 00:09:02,542
may still be somewhere
on school grounds.

173
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:03,975
Do you really think
you can trust some

174
00:09:04,008 --> 00:09:05,608
random chick you just met?

175
00:09:05,642 --> 00:09:08,608
I'm not sure. That's why
we're investigating.

176
00:09:08,642 --> 00:09:10,608
[TOUJI] If what
she's saying is true,

177
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:12,508
then that rumor that
said the real Raven Coat

178
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:14,308
was being stored
here might actually

179
00:09:14,342 --> 00:09:15,908
have a shred of credibility.

180
00:09:17,742 --> 00:09:19,642
[TOUJI] Any way you slice it,
us digging through

181
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:20,975
all the records
here is going to be

182
00:09:21,008 --> 00:09:22,775
a hell of a lot slower
than if we just asked

183
00:09:22,808 --> 00:09:24,542
the principal
directly, y'know.

184
00:09:24,575 --> 00:09:26,642
[NATSUME] She's busy
right now after the attack.

185
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:28,608
And she's cagier
than she looks.

186
00:09:28,642 --> 00:09:31,675
With information in our hands,
she can't misdirect us.

187
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,908
If we can find records
from when the school opened,

188
00:09:33,942 --> 00:09:36,675
we might stumble across
some intel on Yakou.

189
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,942
As much as I'd love to
spend hours blood-hounding

190
00:09:38,975 --> 00:09:40,642
with you guys,
it's probably easier to

191
00:09:40,675 --> 00:09:42,308
give Taco-
whats-her-name a call.

192
00:09:42,342 --> 00:09:45,308
Uh yeah, we sorta forgot
to ask for her number.

193
00:09:46,508 --> 00:09:48,042
[TOUJI] Awesome.
It's gonna be like

194
00:09:48,075 --> 00:09:50,342
finding one needle
in a stack of 'em.

195
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,375
Don't sweat it, guys!
There should be a place

196
00:09:52,408 --> 00:09:53,975
where all of the
school's records were held,

197
00:09:54,008 --> 00:09:55,675
so we just have to dig
through whichever pile

198
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,942
of books that happens to be!

199
00:09:57,975 --> 00:09:59,542
From now on, dude,
make sure when you

200
00:09:59,575 --> 00:10:00,808
meet a woman
for the first time,

201
00:10:00,842 --> 00:10:02,542
you get her
freaking number, okay?

202
00:10:02,575 --> 00:10:03,675
Ya got it.

203
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,708
Next mysterious girl I bump
into at a creepy altar,

204
00:10:05,742 --> 00:10:07,342
I'll totally
get her digits.

205
00:10:13,908 --> 00:10:16,942
[KON humming]

206
00:10:16,975 --> 00:10:18,808
Ah!

207
00:10:19,908 --> 00:10:21,742
[shrieks]

208
00:10:22,808 --> 00:10:24,675
[HARUTORA] Hmmm.

209
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,408
[TOUJI snoring]

210
00:10:26,442 --> 00:10:28,008
[yawns]

211
00:10:30,075 --> 00:10:31,908
It's useless! The tenth
class is as far back

212
00:10:31,942 --> 00:10:34,542
as it goes. Nothing from
when it was founded!

213
00:10:34,575 --> 00:10:35,975
[HARUTORA] I kind of wanted
to see what the principal

214
00:10:36,008 --> 00:10:38,442
looked like before sixty
years chomped into her.

215
00:10:38,475 --> 00:10:40,375
[TOUJI] You and me both, man.

216
00:10:40,408 --> 00:10:41,442
Hey, it just came to me.

217
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:44,342
Mister Ohtomo's got to
be in one of these books.

218
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,375
Yeah, he does.

219
00:10:46,408 --> 00:10:48,575
[HARUTORA] Kogure was
in the same class, right?

220
00:10:48,608 --> 00:10:49,842
Ah!

221
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,442
Which class was it though?

222
00:10:51,475 --> 00:10:53,408
[TOUJI] Hey, Natsume!
You know, don't ya?

223
00:10:53,442 --> 00:10:56,375
Guys, can you please
take this seriously?

224
00:10:57,575 --> 00:11:00,275
Fine. The
thirty-sixth class.

225
00:11:00,308 --> 00:11:02,508
[HARUTORA]
Here he is. Jin Ohtomo!

226
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:04,275
Aw man.
What a rip off!

227
00:11:04,308 --> 00:11:06,375
I wanted to see a
picture of him as a kid!

228
00:11:06,408 --> 00:11:09,342
Let's see. "It was a
meaningful three years."

229
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,542
Well that's nice and
noncommittal, there, Jin.

230
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:13,608
[TOUJI] Talk about
a lazy quote.

231
00:11:13,642 --> 00:11:14,475
Uh.

232
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,608
I guess he was
just as nerdy back then!

233
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,442
[ALL laugh]

234
00:11:18,475 --> 00:11:20,875
And now for Kogure!
Where's he at?

235
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:23,642
What'd ya find?

236
00:11:23,675 --> 00:11:25,708
Weird. Take a
look at this name.

237
00:11:25,742 --> 00:11:27,542
Seems familiar to me.

238
00:11:29,775 --> 00:11:32,542
But all I know is what
I studied in a few books.

239
00:11:32,575 --> 00:11:33,908
[SUZUKA] It was a
report written by a person

240
00:11:33,942 --> 00:11:35,642
called Ryou Saotome.

241
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:38,008
He had served under my
father in the Ghost Division.

242
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:39,575
[HARUTORA] Huh.

243
00:11:47,502 --> 00:11:49,468
Mister Ohtomo and
Ryou Saotome were both

244
00:11:49,502 --> 00:11:50,902
at school in
the same year?

245
00:11:50,935 --> 00:11:53,368
I can't believe I didn't
check the old yearbooks.

246
00:11:53,402 --> 00:11:54,735
I knew he was an alum!

247
00:11:54,768 --> 00:11:56,502
I wonder if that Souma
girl you told us about

248
00:11:56,535 --> 00:11:58,635
is really a student
like she claimed.

249
00:11:58,668 --> 00:12:00,368
If most of the school
hadn't been blown to bits

250
00:12:00,402 --> 00:12:01,702
during that fight,
we could've asked

251
00:12:01,735 --> 00:12:03,335
the admissions
office about it.

252
00:12:03,368 --> 00:12:05,802
No. I'd rather
ask Mister Ohtomo.

253
00:12:07,902 --> 00:12:09,568
[car horn honks]

254
00:12:11,368 --> 00:12:13,435
Fancy meeting you
in a place like this.

255
00:12:13,468 --> 00:12:15,002
Oh! Hey Suzu!

256
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:17,668
Weird running into
you out in Ueno, right?

257
00:12:17,702 --> 00:12:19,668
I had hoped to invite
Kon for a drive.

258
00:12:19,702 --> 00:12:21,568
Y'know, once in a
while a serious answer

259
00:12:21,602 --> 00:12:22,568
would be awesome.

260
00:12:22,602 --> 00:12:24,635
Don't worry; I'll have
her home well before dark.

261
00:12:24,668 --> 00:12:26,368
Uh yeah, that's not
really the issue.

262
00:12:26,402 --> 00:12:27,935
[SUZU] I would, of course,
be willing to pay.

263
00:12:27,968 --> 00:12:30,302
[HARUTORA] That has even
less to do with the issue!

264
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,402
Oh! How 'bout introductions!

265
00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:33,802
[HARUTORA] Natsume,
you've already met.

266
00:12:33,835 --> 00:12:35,902
Suzu, this is the
rest of the gang.

267
00:12:35,935 --> 00:12:37,468
I'm aware.

268
00:12:37,502 --> 00:12:39,602
[SUZU] Touji Ato,
Kyoko Kurahashi,

269
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,935
Suzuka Dairenji
and Four-Eyes.

270
00:12:41,968 --> 00:12:43,368
--What?
--Ah, so you already

271
00:12:43,402 --> 00:12:44,668
know them, then? Cool.

272
00:12:44,702 --> 00:12:46,368
Well, I guess each
one of us is known

273
00:12:46,402 --> 00:12:47,802
throughout the school
for different things.

274
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:49,902
Uh. What about me?

275
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,468
Uh.

276
00:12:53,568 --> 00:12:57,502
[BOY] He's a familiar.
Created just for driving.

277
00:12:59,602 --> 00:13:00,468
Heh.

278
00:13:00,502 --> 00:13:01,802
Whoa. What the--?

279
00:13:01,835 --> 00:13:03,735
Don't we all look
hale and hearty?

280
00:13:03,768 --> 00:13:06,235
I was worried after our last--

281
00:13:06,268 --> 00:13:07,568
--What? Wait.
--Shut your mouth.

282
00:13:07,602 --> 00:13:09,502
--He... he said--
--Don't worry about him.

283
00:13:09,535 --> 00:13:10,502
How could I
not be worried?

284
00:13:10,535 --> 00:13:11,468
That kid's weird.

285
00:13:11,502 --> 00:13:12,668
The child is defective.

286
00:13:12,702 --> 00:13:14,535
What am I saying?
Of course he's weird.

287
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:15,768
He's with you.

288
00:13:15,802 --> 00:13:17,335
I'm taking care of him.

289
00:13:17,368 --> 00:13:18,868
He's the son
of a relative.

290
00:13:18,902 --> 00:13:20,702
He threw a tantrum
and claimed I had to

291
00:13:20,735 --> 00:13:22,235
take him to meet someone.

292
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,635
I guess I caved,
and now here we are.

293
00:13:24,668 --> 00:13:26,502
[SUZU] By the time we
arrived, someone else was

294
00:13:26,535 --> 00:13:30,368
visiting that person,
so we decided to leave.

295
00:13:30,402 --> 00:13:32,735
Honestly though,
I'm kind of glad.

296
00:13:33,802 --> 00:13:35,935
[BOY] Shall we?

297
00:13:35,968 --> 00:13:37,668
We have to go now.

298
00:13:37,702 --> 00:13:40,902
So all is normal and
I am completely lost.

299
00:13:40,935 --> 00:13:42,668
Say hello to
the brat for me!

300
00:13:45,535 --> 00:13:47,702
Something about that
whole convo was off.

301
00:13:47,735 --> 00:13:48,968
I got the heebie jeebies.

302
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:49,935
[sighs]

303
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:52,402
[AMAMI] They say the
curse is mostly gone.

304
00:13:52,435 --> 00:13:53,968
So what, was it
destroyed starting

305
00:13:54,002 --> 00:13:56,402
at the roots or something?

306
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:59,335
For better or worse, white
hair is gonna be my new look.

307
00:13:59,368 --> 00:14:00,735
I think of it
like my right leg;

308
00:14:00,768 --> 00:14:03,335
it's just a change I'll
need to adjust to, that's all.

309
00:14:03,368 --> 00:14:05,335
Well you routed
Doman Ashiya anyway

310
00:14:05,368 --> 00:14:06,902
and we're all
very proud of you.

311
00:14:06,935 --> 00:14:08,835
I hardly won an
all-out magical battle

312
00:14:08,868 --> 00:14:09,968
against him, though.

313
00:14:10,002 --> 00:14:12,468
It was just a demonstration
of skill, nothing more.

314
00:14:12,502 --> 00:14:14,535
From his point of view,
my Onmyo posturing was

315
00:14:14,568 --> 00:14:16,435
little more than
child's play, surely.

316
00:14:16,468 --> 00:14:18,002
Nothing to be
embarrassed about.

317
00:14:18,035 --> 00:14:20,402
You survived because
your strength was real.

318
00:14:20,435 --> 00:14:21,768
Oh dear, you're not
going to get all

319
00:14:21,802 --> 00:14:22,968
mushy on me now, are you?

320
00:14:23,002 --> 00:14:25,735
Beware Greeks bearing
gifts they say.

321
00:14:25,768 --> 00:14:28,468
So I'm guessing you're not
just here to tuck me in.

322
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:29,735
Mmm.

323
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,935
Yes, tomorrow, we're completely
cleaning house at the Agency.

324
00:14:32,968 --> 00:14:34,402
You're gonna pull
the Syndicate out

325
00:14:34,435 --> 00:14:35,702
into the light of day?

326
00:14:35,735 --> 00:14:38,468
That's right; I can't
miss this opportunity.

327
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,402
This time I'll be
more thorough.

328
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:41,668
From the ground up.

329
00:14:41,702 --> 00:14:43,868
That always has
been my objective.

330
00:14:43,902 --> 00:14:45,768
We're conducting
internal investigations

331
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,235
in the departments.

332
00:14:47,268 --> 00:14:49,402
Twin Horn
Syndicate excision.

333
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:50,902
This will most likely
be the last job

334
00:14:50,935 --> 00:14:53,235
I do for the Agency.

335
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:54,968
But sir!

336
00:14:55,002 --> 00:14:56,968
Call me sentimental,
but that's pretty much

337
00:14:57,002 --> 00:14:59,235
the reason I came
by here today.

338
00:14:59,268 --> 00:15:00,868
[AMAMI] Those rats
are going to resist,

339
00:15:00,902 --> 00:15:02,768
and they just might get
it in their heads to go

340
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,968
and bother your
poor students again.

341
00:15:05,002 --> 00:15:07,535
But this time, the
Onmyo Agency will provide

342
00:15:07,568 --> 00:15:09,002
a proper guard for them.

343
00:15:09,035 --> 00:15:11,502
So you can just
rest here quietly.

344
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,568
That's what I
came to tell you.

345
00:15:15,802 --> 00:15:18,268
Can we get some food?

346
00:15:18,302 --> 00:15:19,868
Come on, Reiji.
You told me we were

347
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:21,568
going to have some fun.

348
00:15:21,602 --> 00:15:23,335
It's my first day
out in a while,

349
00:15:23,368 --> 00:15:25,635
and all we're
doing is waiting.

350
00:15:25,668 --> 00:15:27,735
[SHAVER] So far it's
been a real let down.

351
00:15:27,768 --> 00:15:29,402
You've been acting
different ever since

352
00:15:29,435 --> 00:15:30,935
you got that X
on your forehead,

353
00:15:30,968 --> 00:15:32,535
I'll have you know.

354
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:36,468
C'mere, Shaver.

355
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,302
Yes? You gotta plan?

356
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:39,402
[KAGAMI grunts]

357
00:15:39,435 --> 00:15:40,768
[SHAVER groans]

358
00:15:41,468 --> 00:15:42,835
[KAGAMI] Shut up!

359
00:15:44,768 --> 00:15:47,335
Hey! What's the
big idea, Reiji?

360
00:15:47,368 --> 00:15:48,702
That's "Master."

361
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,502
[KAGAMI grunts]
[SHAVER groans]

362
00:15:49,535 --> 00:15:50,702
[CROWD gasping]

363
00:15:50,735 --> 00:15:54,302
[SHAVER] Wait. No, stop!

364
00:15:54,335 --> 00:15:55,835
Master, please!

365
00:15:59,735 --> 00:16:02,902
[cell phone ringing]

366
00:16:02,935 --> 00:16:04,502
[SHAVER] Come on, Reiji.

367
00:16:04,535 --> 00:16:06,268
What was that for?

368
00:16:06,302 --> 00:16:07,635
Well, well.

369
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,535
We've got another
chance to show everyone

370
00:16:10,568 --> 00:16:12,535
what you can really do.

371
00:16:15,035 --> 00:16:16,935
[grunts breathily]

372
00:16:16,968 --> 00:16:19,402
Knock, knock! You up
for some visitors, sir?

373
00:16:19,435 --> 00:16:21,335
Hey!

374
00:16:21,368 --> 00:16:23,335
Oh, hi there.

375
00:16:23,368 --> 00:16:25,935
Kyoko, Suzuka!
It's been far too long

376
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:27,535
and I don't believe
I've had the pleasure

377
00:16:27,568 --> 00:16:28,802
of meeting the rest of you.

378
00:16:28,835 --> 00:16:30,668
What are you doing here,
Uncle Amami?

379
00:16:30,702 --> 00:16:32,635
Wait, that's weird.
This guy's your uncle?

380
00:16:32,668 --> 00:16:33,902
Family friend.

381
00:16:33,935 --> 00:16:35,568
[KYOKO] He's the
Director of the Bureau.

382
00:16:35,602 --> 00:16:38,268
Amami's the name.
Pleased to meet you.

383
00:16:38,302 --> 00:16:39,935
Hi. It's nice
to meet you, sir.

384
00:16:39,968 --> 00:16:41,035
What brings
the director of

385
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:43,402
the Magical Investigation
Bureau all the way out here?

386
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:44,768
Actually this
little visit of theirs

387
00:16:44,802 --> 00:16:46,435
isn't surprising at all.

388
00:16:46,468 --> 00:16:48,802
[SUZUKA] These two used
to serve together in the MIB,

389
00:16:48,835 --> 00:16:50,268
and the old guy
also hangs out

390
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:51,835
with the principal sometimes.

391
00:16:51,868 --> 00:16:54,235
I find it very inspiring
that you went out of your way

392
00:16:54,268 --> 00:16:55,702
to visit a former colleague.

393
00:16:55,735 --> 00:16:58,268
Thank you for taking the time
out from your busy schedule.

394
00:16:58,302 --> 00:16:59,802
Hey, come on!
I should be the one

395
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:02,668
saying all that crap
to him! Not that I would.

396
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:04,835
[SUZUKA] Whatever. This old
fogey wouldn't come all the way

397
00:17:04,868 --> 00:17:07,735
out here for any
ordinary Bureau drone.

398
00:17:07,768 --> 00:17:09,302
[ALL gasp]

399
00:17:10,402 --> 00:17:13,502
In fact, this confirms
all my suspicions.

400
00:17:13,535 --> 00:17:16,868
[SUZUKA] He easily destroyed
the seal on my magic.

401
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:18,568
He knows cryptic
old spells that aren't

402
00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:20,668
part of the Imperial style.

403
00:17:20,702 --> 00:17:22,835
A prep school teacher
who fought Doman Ashiya

404
00:17:22,868 --> 00:17:24,368
to a standstill?

405
00:17:24,402 --> 00:17:26,535
And one who can enlist
independent exorcists

406
00:17:26,568 --> 00:17:28,868
to help him win
such a pitched battle.

407
00:17:28,902 --> 00:17:30,602
There's only one
person in the Bureau

408
00:17:30,635 --> 00:17:33,802
other than the Divine Fan,
Amami, who has power like his.

409
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:35,468
They tried to hide
his title from us,

410
00:17:35,502 --> 00:17:38,668
but it's obvious that
he's a Divine General.

411
00:17:39,902 --> 00:17:41,602
[SUZUKA] Code-name "Shadow!"

412
00:17:41,635 --> 00:17:43,268
Ta-da!

413
00:17:43,302 --> 00:17:44,535
Gotcha!

414
00:17:44,568 --> 00:17:45,935
What? I'm sorry,
you lost--

415
00:17:45,968 --> 00:17:48,435
[AMAMI] Oh-ho! The little
lady is pretty good!

416
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:49,868
Hey, be quiet!

417
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,502
It's far too late to try
hiding it from them now.

418
00:17:52,535 --> 00:17:54,002
And by the way,
the name "Shadow"

419
00:17:54,035 --> 00:17:55,868
is pretty
pretentious, right?

420
00:17:55,902 --> 00:17:57,635
Stage Hand is
more like it.

421
00:17:57,668 --> 00:17:59,368
Are you joking?
"Divine Fan" is way more

422
00:17:59,402 --> 00:18:01,302
pretentious
than "Shadow."

423
00:18:01,935 --> 00:18:03,568
Okay, are you
being for real?

424
00:18:03,602 --> 00:18:05,535
You used to be
a Divine General?

425
00:18:05,568 --> 00:18:06,868
You know if that's the case,

426
00:18:06,902 --> 00:18:08,402
it does explain
how he held his own

427
00:18:08,435 --> 00:18:10,302
for so long in the battle.

428
00:18:10,335 --> 00:18:11,535
But why would you
want to leave

429
00:18:11,568 --> 00:18:13,468
the Magical Investigation
Bureau just to

430
00:18:13,502 --> 00:18:14,902
become a prep school teacher?

431
00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:16,402
[groans lightly]

432
00:18:16,435 --> 00:18:17,735
If I was a betting man,

433
00:18:17,768 --> 00:18:19,935
I'd say the reason
is you, Natsume.

434
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:22,302
[TOUJI] Mister Ohtomo accepted
a position at Onmyo Prep

435
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,668
about a year ago.

436
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:26,635
Around the same time
you enrolled in the school.

437
00:18:26,668 --> 00:18:28,702
The principal probably
read the star charts.

438
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,268
She must've seen
the trouble you would

439
00:18:30,302 --> 00:18:31,568
bring to the school,
then she went to

440
00:18:31,602 --> 00:18:33,468
Director Amami to
recruit Mister Ohtomo

441
00:18:33,502 --> 00:18:34,902
as a form of insurance.

442
00:18:34,935 --> 00:18:36,968
It all fits
quite nicely, I'd say.

443
00:18:37,002 --> 00:18:38,535
Good work, young man.

444
00:18:38,568 --> 00:18:40,668
If you always rely on
others for your answers,

445
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,935
then you'll never be able
to think critically.

446
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:45,535
So then, you're saying
Touji was right?

447
00:18:45,568 --> 00:18:47,935
[AMAMI] You should think
about what I've said too, boy.

448
00:18:47,968 --> 00:18:50,602
In fact, I have a bit of
helpful advice for you.

449
00:18:50,635 --> 00:18:52,702
Every adult is
cagier than they seem,

450
00:18:52,735 --> 00:18:54,735
devious down to
their very bones.

451
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:57,602
Never take what they say
at face value, son.

452
00:18:58,535 --> 00:19:01,502
Then you may learn to
stand on your own two feet.

453
00:19:01,535 --> 00:19:02,668
[AMAMI]
Ohtomo, share with them

454
00:19:02,702 --> 00:19:05,302
what we talked about earlier!

455
00:19:05,335 --> 00:19:07,702
You might not be able
to contact me for a while,

456
00:19:07,735 --> 00:19:09,968
but that's all
part of the plan.

457
00:19:10,002 --> 00:19:12,335
Well take care of yourself.

458
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:13,435
[chuckles lightly]

459
00:19:13,468 --> 00:19:15,302
But of course.

460
00:19:17,435 --> 00:19:19,368
So come in!
Take a seat!

461
00:19:19,968 --> 00:19:21,368
There are a few things
I should probably

462
00:19:21,402 --> 00:19:22,868
fill you guys in on.

463
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,447
[HARUTORA] So wait.
The Twin Horn Syndicate

464
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,614
will be gone,
once and for all?

465
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:34,347
[OHTOMO] Well, that's
Director Amami's plan,

466
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,114
at the very least.

467
00:19:36,147 --> 00:19:38,480
Even so, there's still
a reason to be cautious.

468
00:19:38,514 --> 00:19:40,147
The Onmyo Agency
will be providing

469
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,414
a guard for you, but we
should all remain vigilant.

470
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,114
We don't know how
Doman is planning

471
00:19:44,147 --> 00:19:45,514
to make his move, either.

472
00:19:45,547 --> 00:19:46,480
[ALL gasp]

473
00:19:46,514 --> 00:19:47,280
Whoa, Doman?

474
00:19:47,314 --> 00:19:49,147
You mean he could
still be alive?

475
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,447
Oh no, he's dead.

476
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,580
Doman Ashiya is
definitely dead.

477
00:19:52,614 --> 00:19:54,014
But we don't know
yet if he's been

478
00:19:54,047 --> 00:19:56,014
completely destroyed.

479
00:19:57,014 --> 00:19:59,047
Hey, you should all
be fine for a while!

480
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,980
Just make sure you don't
let your guard down.

481
00:20:01,014 --> 00:20:03,180
That's very reassuring.

482
00:20:04,147 --> 00:20:05,547
Takiko Souma, huh?

483
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,014
I've never heard
of her before.

484
00:20:07,047 --> 00:20:09,080
[HARUTORA] She told us
that she was a student.

485
00:20:09,114 --> 00:20:10,947
She has red hair.

486
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,014
A redhead you say?

487
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:14,214
[OHTOMO] I might
have had some students

488
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:16,114
with the last name Souma,

489
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:18,614
but I would remember
the red hair, for sure.

490
00:20:18,647 --> 00:20:20,914
Doesn't sound
like one of mine.

491
00:20:20,947 --> 00:20:22,980
Eh, thanks anyway.

492
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:24,914
There is another name.

493
00:20:24,947 --> 00:20:25,780
Feel free to ask.

494
00:20:25,814 --> 00:20:27,547
I can't promise
I'll know who they are.

495
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,314
I have a feeling
this one will be familiar.

496
00:20:30,347 --> 00:20:31,914
Ryou Saotome.

497
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:33,280
[gasps]

498
00:20:33,547 --> 00:20:35,247
[SUZUKA] Huh?

499
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,247
[OHTOMO groans]

500
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,547
I should be taking it
easy, not stressing out.

501
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,514
So you know who this

502
00:20:39,547 --> 00:20:42,014
Ryou Saotome guy is, don't you?

503
00:20:42,047 --> 00:20:44,080
Yeah, we were in the
same class at school.

504
00:20:44,114 --> 00:20:45,514
Oh, so it was worth
coming all the way

505
00:20:45,547 --> 00:20:47,347
out here to visit you!

506
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,014
[SUZUKA] Saotome was
a pioneer in the field

507
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,314
of Yakou research.

508
00:20:50,347 --> 00:20:52,480
Did you know
anything about that?

509
00:20:53,914 --> 00:20:56,114
You're talking about
the Raven Coat, aren't you?

510
00:20:56,147 --> 00:20:57,447
Yeah.

511
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,580
[sighs]

512
00:20:58,614 --> 00:21:01,414
[OHTOMO] There's one tiny
detail you guys got wrong.

513
00:21:01,447 --> 00:21:04,280
It's "Suzu." It's written
as "Ryou Saotome,"

514
00:21:04,314 --> 00:21:06,314
but read as "Suzu Saotome."

515
00:21:06,347 --> 00:21:07,447
[ALL gasp]

516
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,880
So then
it's really... Suzu?

517
00:21:10,914 --> 00:21:13,014
I know you kids
probably won't listen.

518
00:21:13,047 --> 00:21:15,380
But be careful.
Saotome is trouble.

519
00:21:15,414 --> 00:21:18,014
Not the easiest to
deal with, so watch out.

520
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,980
[TOUJI] As it stands,
no one's seen Suzu in a while.

521
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,880
And we don't have
anything on Takiko either.

522
00:21:24,914 --> 00:21:26,080
Kyoko, have you
heard anything

523
00:21:26,114 --> 00:21:27,147
from your grandmother?

524
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,147
[KYOKO] Sorry, I haven't
had the chance to ask her.

525
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,580
Poor Grandmother
has been incredibly busy

526
00:21:31,614 --> 00:21:33,414
ever since the attack.

527
00:21:33,447 --> 00:21:35,214
Harutora,
what's on your mind?

528
00:21:35,247 --> 00:21:36,314
You've been sitting
there for a while

529
00:21:36,347 --> 00:21:37,314
all spaced out.

530
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:41,080
What? Oh. Yeah.
It's nothing, man.

531
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,847
I doubt it's anything
more than a red herring,

532
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,614
but I was just thinking
of that upperclassman

533
00:21:46,647 --> 00:21:48,380
named Suzu we met.

534
00:21:48,414 --> 00:21:51,580
Suzu? You mean the
weird girl from yesterday?

535
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,314
[ALL] Hm?

536
00:22:02,147 --> 00:22:03,480
[ALL gasp]

537
00:22:14,014 --> 00:22:14,914
Count your blessings.

538
00:22:14,947 --> 00:22:17,547
It's time for the
big boys to play, kids!

539
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,147
For the time being,
you lucky brats

540
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,280
get to be guarded by me.

541
00:22:21,314 --> 00:22:22,880
[HIRATA] Prepare yourselves!

542
00:22:22,914 --> 00:22:25,114
The Onmyo Agency and
the exorcism department

543
00:22:25,147 --> 00:22:28,280
are taking down the Twin
Horn Syndicate immediately.

544
00:24:00,214 --> 00:24:02,314
You insolent fool!
I'll have you know,

545
00:24:02,347 --> 00:24:03,980
this isn't fake fur!
It's genuine!
