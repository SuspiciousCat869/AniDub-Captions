1
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,291
[TAKIKO] Thanks a lot!

2
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:36,041
I had no idea where Natsume
and Harutora's class was,

3
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,375
and I didn't want to wander.

4
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,208
So, are you like a friend
of theirs or something?

5
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:40,708
That's right.

6
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,458
It's quite a coincidence to
have you showing me around,

7
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,083
since I know your
father as well.

8
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,083
You know Dad?

9
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:47,083
[door knob turns]

10
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:49,208
[YASHAMARU] Hey.

11
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:50,958
What are you
doing in here?

12
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:52,875
I simply came to say hello.

13
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:54,375
Long time no see.

14
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:57,083
[KURAHASHI] You're looking very
young lately, aren't you?

15
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,958
[YASHAMARU] It wasn't
really my choice.

16
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,750
I have to match her.

17
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,750
And where is
Princess Souma?

18
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,125
She just stepped out.

19
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,291
Left rather early
to meet someone.

20
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:09,583
The next heir of the
Tsuchimikado clan.

21
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,166
You mean you still
haven't been able to

22
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,500
get a hold of your father?

23
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:45,500
No.

24
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,750
[TAKIKO]
Natsume! Harutora!

25
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:49,875
Takiko?

26
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,958
Hey! It's really good
to see you guys again!

27
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,875
[HARUTORA] Yeah.
Why are you here?

28
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:58,291
I'm supposed to take a tour
of the school grounds today.

29
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,333
You certain it's her?

30
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,791
I am.

31
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,541
[HARUTORA] She's the one we
were talking about before:

32
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,541
Takiko Souma.

33
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:08,666
[HARUTORA and NATSUME chuckle]

34
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,375
First the fire,
now this nonsense?

35
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,958
[KYOKO sighs]

36
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,166
[KURAHASHI] But I specifically
told her to refrain from doing

37
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,750
any excursions
on her own.

38
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,291
Oh Yeah?
Sorry about that.

39
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,916
She got somewhat carried
away when she heard

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,666
that we had tracked
down the Raven Coat.

41
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,750
[KURAHASHI] You mean all of
the memories are intact?

42
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,291
My memories?

43
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,166
They're clear up until my death.

44
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,458
That's why I'm filling in
the blanks as best as I can

45
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:31,875
for the time being.

46
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,291
[YASHAMARU]
But "The Great Purification

47
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,791
of the Dolls' Festival"?

48
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,583
What a fantastic name.

49
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,375
All in all, I guess
we were lucky to

50
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,666
get away with only
minimal damage.

51
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,666
Your strength seems to
have increased, as well.

52
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,375
Yes, I was surprised
by that outcome myself!

53
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,916
If someone like me
has become this strong,

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,666
[YASHAMARU] just wait
until the princess decides

55
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,041
to demonstrate her true power.

56
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,333
It will change our world.

57
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,791
No exaggeration.

58
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,250
[STUDENTS chatter]

59
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,791
So many tasty options,
how do you choose?

60
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,833
You haven't seen this
kind of thing before?

61
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:03,791
[TAKIKO] No!

62
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,166
Moving on.

63
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,208
[HARUTORA] Let's check
out the practice arena next.

64
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,541
Those buffoons.

65
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,666
Shouldn't they be dealing
with "other issues" first?

66
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,916
You're talking
about Kyoko?

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,666
Of course.
What else is there?

68
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,708
Well, Harutora and
Natsume both had

69
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,541
a lot on their minds
this morning.

70
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,666
Go on.

71
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,083
You don't know
'bout the fire?

72
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,333
The fire?

73
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,958
[TAKIKO giggles]

74
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,333
It seems like you're
having some fun.

75
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,750
I am!

76
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,375
It's always been my dream
to hang out with everyone

77
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:31,583
just like this.

78
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:32,750
Your dream?

79
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,750
I've always had to
study magic by myself.

80
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,708
But hopefully,
that's about to change.

81
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,416
Which means you were
lying when you said

82
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,958
you were already
a student here.

83
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,208
It's not a lie.

84
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,333
That is to say, I'm not
officially enrolled yet.

85
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,708
[HARUTORA]
What do you mean?

86
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:50,833
Look, it's...
it's still a secret.

87
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,916
Anyway, where'd Chief
Kurahashi's daughter go?

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,208
[HARUTORA] She's...

89
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:58,375
This idiot duo got
into a fight with her.

90
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,083
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,416
But that means you should make
up with her as soon as you can!

92
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,875
I know she'd understand
if you talked to her.

93
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,500
Do you really think so?

94
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,333
[FUJIWARA]
Excuse me, Natsume.

95
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:10,833
Please go to the office.

96
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,416
The principal said she had
something to discuss with you.

97
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,875
[NATSUME] I'll head
straight there.

98
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,125
The principal?

99
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,375
Yeah, it's probably
about the fire.

100
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,500
The fire?

101
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,625
That's horrible!
What happened?

102
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,583
Don't worry, it looks
like his father is okay.

103
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:28,500
[TAKIKO] The Tsuchimikado
main family. Vanished?

104
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:32,291
Then, when they said
they got the Coat...

105
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,416
What did you do?

106
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,875
[TOUJI and HARUTORA] Uh.

107
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,500
[footsteps]

108
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:40,541
[HARUTORA] Natsume!

109
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,291
[TOUJI] You find out
anything else?

110
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:46,000
No. They asked if I
knew anything instead.

111
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:49,500
So even the principal's
in the dark about this?

112
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,375
Allow me to explain.

113
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:53,791
This is tough.

114
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:57,625
But I don't want to hide
anything from you if possible.

115
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,916
[TAKIKO] First of all,
Yasuzumi Tsuchimikado is fine.

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,291
I don't know where he is now,

117
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:05,041
but he's the one who
set fire to the house.

118
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,500
Though it looks like
the aggressive actions

119
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:09,500
of the Onmyo Agency
were partly to blame.

120
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,750
Apologies.

121
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,000
That's a helluva way
to make a move.

122
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,875
You're saying the
Onmyo Agency attacked

123
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,250
the Tsuchimikado family.

124
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,791
And the fire was the
result of that mess?

125
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,375
Dead right.

126
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:24,458
However, the goal was never to
oppose the Tsuchimikado family.

127
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:28,375
It's just... Yasuzumi forgot
about his responsibilities.

128
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,708
If the confrontation
stemmed from that,

129
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,666
all I can say is that
it couldn't be helped.

130
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,041
Hold up a sec. What are
you trying to tell us?

131
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,166
Uh!

132
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,916
Back off!

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,958
Natsume.

134
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:46,083
My family has a bit of
a history with Yakou.

135
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:49,541
And I have a personal
interest in him as well.

136
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,458
[TAKIKO] Part of
the reason why I'm here,

137
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,250
why I'm so interested in you,

138
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,416
is because you're
his reincarnation.

139
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,458
Then you're just
another Yakou devotee?

140
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,458
[TAKIKO] No!

141
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,416
I'm not like all of those
weirdoes you already met.

142
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,958
I swear.

143
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,833
You have to believe me!

144
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:11,083
Takiko. What's your
angle on all this?

145
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:14,125
I just... I just
want to be your friend.

146
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:17,083
Really.
That's all I want.

147
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,083
I see how close
you guys are.

148
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:22,000
I've never had any
close friends like that.

149
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,708
[TAKIKO] I'm bad at
expressing myself.

150
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:28,208
I'm sure I've been rude and
impolite unintentionally.

151
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:31,666
But magic can communicate
things words might fail to.

152
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,083
So, Natsume...

153
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,041
Just this one time,

154
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,833
would you honor me
with a battle?

155
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,500
[NATSUME] Takiko.

156
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,958
So many things about her
are still a mystery.

157
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,333
[TAKIKO] Order!

158
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:51,041
[NATSUME] But I didn't sense
any deceit in her words.

159
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,791
Order, wall!

160
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,583
[NATSUME] Besides.

161

00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,166
any other friends.

322
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,041
And that's why...

323
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,291
...it was so much easier
for me to go to school

324
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,416
dressed in a boys' uniform.

325
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,375
I'd always been
around boys anyway.

326
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,250
But then we met.

327
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,041
[NATSUME] I was selfish,
and I didn't think

328
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,125
about how that would hurt you.

329
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,000
After you called me a liar,

330
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,166
I suddenly realized
what had happened.

331
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,583
You deserve more.

332
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:32,500
[NATSUME]
Please, let me apologize!

333
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,541
I'm so sorry!

334
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,125
[KYOKO chuckles lightly]

335
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,083
That was a brave
thing for you to say.

336
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,333
Really.

337
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:43,500
And you deserve the same
kind of honesty from me.

338
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,416
[KYOKO inhales deeply]

339
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,791
Natsume. You're being unfair!

340
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,208
[gasps]

341
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,708
[KYOKO] You think you can
just apologize like that?

342
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,958
So you get to feel better?

343
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,958
That just isn't how
it works, all right?

344
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,875
[NATSUME] No!
I didn't mean it that way!

345
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,041
[KYOKO] I know, but...

346
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:04,541
How could you not even notice
that, that I liked you?

347
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,083
[KYOKO] You had a dozen
chances to say something,

348
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,041
but you used your
"tradition" as an excuse

349
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,791
to ignore my feelings
because it was

350
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,250
easier than
confronting them!

351
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,875
--[NATSUME] Sorry--
--[KYOKO] Don't!

352
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:16,875
When all was said and done,

353
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,333
you didn't
care about me at all!

354
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,250
That isn't true,
I swear it!

355
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,791
And it never will be!

356
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:28,000
Kyoko, I promise you that
I treasure our friendship!

357
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,666
The fact that you
think otherwise.

358
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,166
It hurts.

359
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,833
'Cause there's no way I'd
ever stop caring about you!

360
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,250
[KYOKO] Stop it!

361
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,541
Don't you dare try to make
yourself a martyr with me!

362
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:38,750
[NATSUME]
That's not what I meant!

363
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:39,833
I just...

364
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,541
I don't want to
give up on what we have,

365
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,125
or had or whatever!

366
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,875
Because, it's like,

367
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,500
I love my dad and
Harutora and Touji,

368
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,250
but now I was finally
friends with another girl!

369
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,875
I was happy.

370
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,708
Because you might understand.

371
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,750
[street noise]

372
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,708
[KYOKO] I've been
to your house before.

373
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,791
As a child,
I played with a boy.

374
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,083
He was my first crush.

375
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:18,083
I always assumed that it
was you, but I was wrong.

376
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,583
Jackass!

377
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,625
He didn't even remember me
after I talked to him about it.

378
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,875
It's like, how
horrible can it get?

379
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,208
Does that mean?

380
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,333
Mm.

381
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,291
It's complicated.

382
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,000
Look who I'm talking to.

383
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:35,208
You like Harutora,
am I right?

384
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,041
If I told you that I still
plan to go for him anyway,

385
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,875
regardless of
how you may feel,

386
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,958
[KYOKO] what would you do?

387
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,625
Promise me,

388
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,500
when the time comes, we fight
for him fair and square.

389
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:52,958
Right.

390
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:56,500
[chuckles] Thank you.

391
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,916
[KYOKO] Oh yeah.
Promise me one more thing.

392
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,916
You've got to swear to tell
Harutora about Hokuto.

393
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,458
[NATSUME] How do you
know about that?

394
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,958
Once you've explained
that whole,

395
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,125
I dunno, total
mess of a situation.

396
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,291
Then, the two of
us will be even.

397
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,125
And back at the starting line.

398
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,958
[KYOKO] Agreed?

399
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,250
[KYOKO chuckles]

400
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,666
Best of luck.

401
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,291
[NATSUME chuckles]

402
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,750
I have an idea!

403
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,416
There's a fireworks
festival tomorrow night.

404
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,791
I can't think of a more
perfect setting for you

405
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,625
to finally reveal
your secret to him!

406
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,833
[MIYO] Takiko Souma?

407
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:40,666
[OHTOMO] Correct.

408
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,083
What do you know about her?

409
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,333
[MIYO] During the war,
Tsuchimikado was considered

410
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,583
to be the top of
the Onmyo world.

411
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:50,791
With total support from the
Kura-hashi and Souma clans.

412
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,000
We were defeated.

413
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,125
Then Souma, who had
controlled the military,

414
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,375
suddenly disappeared.

415
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,083
[OHTOMO] Perhaps Souma's
ties to the military

416
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,500
are still in effect?

417
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,416
The disappearance
of Director Amami.

418
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,666
The Tsuchimikado estate
burning to the ground.

419
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,625
And a girl named Souma
suddenly appears.

420
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,708
I find it hard to believe
Chief Kurahashi

421
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,708
would be so out of the loop.

422
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,625
Regrettably, I haven't
seen my son in some time.

423
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,708
Mister Ohtomo,
if you would,

424
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,375
please prepare your
resignation letter.

425
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,708
I see.

426
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,625
A sabbatical would
give me the opportunity

427
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,375
to look in on these issues.

428
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,875
[MIYO chuckles]

429
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,375
Well then.

430
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,208
If I start to move, the task
of watching out for Natsume

431
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,750
would fall upon whom exactly?

432
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,958
Naturally, I would be
glad to keep watch

433
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,500
over the boy in your stead.

434
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:35,916
"The boy"?

435
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,791
So no one's informed you
about the recent developments?

436
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,708
Why whatever do you mean?

437
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,166
[slap]

438
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,208
Ow! What's wrong?

439
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,541
[sighs] Stupid-tora.

440
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,583
[HARUTORA] My bad.

441
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:49,875
[KYOKO]
Wanna know something?

442
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,416
You were a lot cooler
when we were kids.

443
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,708
[HARUTORA] Sorry.

444
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,000
[KYOKO chuckles]

445
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,291
Stupid-tora.

446
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,958
Don't be late!
See you tomorrow.

447
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,708
[HARUTORA]
Uh. Right on!

448
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,541
[HARUTORA chuckles]

449
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,083
[MIYO]
What did you say?

450
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,583
Yes, I was not
expecting it either.

451
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,791
Then, Natsume is
actually a girl?

452
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,208
That cannot be right.

453
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,750
I would've sworn on my
life the child was a boy.

454
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,250
It's true.

455
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:25,791
Yasuzumi. You fool.

456
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,208
[YASHAMARU] Is there a
problem with Suzu Saotome?

457
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,375
[KURAHASHI] For one thing,
she's still missing.

458
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:31,958
Is that so?

459
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:35,416
If she's currently MIA, I guess
we should count her out then.

460
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,750
Tell me what transpired.

461
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,666
It turned into
a magic battle.

462
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,958
What?

463
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:50,125
Just a practice match.
One the princess requested.

464
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,791
Do stop trying to scare
me like that, Mutobe.

465
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,958
Forgive me,
I meant Kumomaru.

466
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,375
Well? She couldn't
have lost, surely.

467
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:01,041
No, sir. But she did lose
control of her emotions.

468
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,541
Is that all?

469
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:03,958
I just--

470
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,375
It scares me to think I'm
similar to those devotees.

471
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,708
[YASHAMARU]
You're not, princess.

472
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:11,291
What you want is not
Yakou Tsuchimikado.

473
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,250
What you want is a companion.

474
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,791
Someone to walk by your side,
someone you can have trust in.

475
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,333
More importantly,
is the revived Yakou

476
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,041
worthy to be your comrade?

477
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:23,000
That is the more pressing
question, if you ask me.

478
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:26,000
Miyachi brought this
with him upon his return.

479
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,208
Is it?

480
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,625
[YASHAMARU]

00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,041
[TAKIKO] Yashamaru!

482
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:35,500
With this, Natsume will
definitely become our comrade!

483
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:39,166
Yes. I sincerely
hope so, highness.

484
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:43,250
[phone rings]

485
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,708
[TAKIKO] Hello!
It's Souma.

486
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:45,958
[KYOKO]
Oh. Hi, Takiko.

487
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,750
[TAKIKO] I got your
number from your dad.

488
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,541
Sorry to just call out
of the blue like this.

489
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,125
No problem, what's up?

490
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,958
[TAKIKO] Well, I got into a bit
of a scuffle with Natsume today.

491
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,291
I was hoping you might be
able to help us make up.

492
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,166
Oh, I'm terribly sorry;

493
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,833
I forgot the two of
you were at odds.

494
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,666
No, that's over
and done with now.

495
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,750
We set things straight
this afternoon!

496
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:05,791
[TAKIKO] Really?

497
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,208
[KYOKO] Yeah!

498
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,541
We're all going to the fireworks
festival tomorrow night.

499
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:10,625
You want to come?

500
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,208
Then maybe I could
help you out, too.

501
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,958
[TAKIKO] That's
very kind! I accept!

502
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,916
Hey, before you go,
one thing.

503
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,791
Was your disagreement
about the "tradition"?

504
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,458
[TAKIKO] I don't know
what that means.

505
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,833
No? It's what
we fought about.

506
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:26,500
[TAKIKO] Hold on.
What tradition?

507
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,416
Well, here goes.

508
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:33,000
[TAKIKO] Natsume....
is a girl?

509
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:37,000
[eerie music plays]

510
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:09,583
Pluck! And pluck! And pluck!

511
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,000
Then cram it in your mouth!
