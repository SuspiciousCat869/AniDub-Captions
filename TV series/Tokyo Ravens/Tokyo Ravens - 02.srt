1
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,916
[HARUTORA] Aahh!

2
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,250
Now then tell
Natsume, or else!

3
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,541
All right, darling?

4
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,750
[HARUTORA]
Hey, are you okay?

5
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,375
How could you?

6
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,958
How could you be so careless?

7
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,083
You didn't even chase after me.

8
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:11,666
And when I come back, you're--
you're kissing that girl.

9
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,833
[HOKUTO cries]

10
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:14,375
[HARUTORA]
No, you've got it wrong.

11
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,833
She trapped me on that thing,
and then she kissed me!

12
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:18,083
I should be the one crying!

13
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:20,000
[HOKUTO] Stupid-tora!
You don't get it!

14
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:22,833
You hurt my feelings and now--

15
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,833
This is even worse.

16
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:27,583
The guy I like
kissed another girl!

17
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:08,041
You haven't talked to Hokuto
since the whole kissing thing?

18
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:12,166
She doesn't answer when I call,
or reply to my texts.

19
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,541
But you're still a hundred
percent sure she's okay, right?

20
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:16,958
[HARUTORA exhales]

21
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,791
[TOUJI sighs]

22
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:20,708
[TOUJI]
What about Natsume?

23
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,250
[HARUTORA] Same story.

24
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:25,291
I haven't heard back
from her, either.

25
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,625
I did some research
after that day.

26
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:31,291
You know about the last ritual
Yakou Tsuchimikado performed?

27
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,375
Yeah.
Of course.

28
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,541
Besides being family history,
it's in our schoolbooks.

29
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:37,833
Because it failed,

30
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,166
the Great Spirit Disaster
happened in Tokyo,

31
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,125
and so, the Tsuchimikado
family was disgraced.

32
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,166
I don't know the exact
contents of the ritual

33
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,208
or anything, though.

34
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,000
[TOUJI] That's what
she wants to do.

35
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,958
The Taizan Fukun Ritual.

36
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:50,916
[HARUTORA] Huh.

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,458
[TOUJI] Remember?
Crazy girl?

38
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:54,708
Thanks to Yakou,

39
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:58,416
the Great Spirit Method
caused a lot of damage.

40
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,166
Recently, there seem to be
more and more onmyo mages

41
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,125
who support him and
believe he wants to complete

42
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,958
the final great magic
working of his life.

43
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:09,500
They believe he's going
to be reincarnated somehow.

44
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,375
Is that kind of thing
even possible?

45
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,041
I dunno, but crazy girl
certainly thinks so.

46
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,041
Bet she wants to
use the same magic.

47
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,958
Only difference is she wants
to bring back someone else.

48
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,375
Well...

49
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:23,875
[TOUJI] Heh. There's a rumor
floating around, too.

50
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,208
About Yakou.

51
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,125
They say in preparation
for a future where

52
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,166
his onmyo magic
will take over,

53
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,958
he's already reincarnated
himself as a descendant

54
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,500
from the Tsuchimikado family.

55
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,833
It's Natsume.

56
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,083
I mean, it's gotta be her,
don't you think?

57
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,666
[cell phone buzzes]

58
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,916
[HARUTORA]
I got a text.

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,250
Is it Hokuto?

60
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,833
[HARUTORA sighs]

61
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,458
[HARUTORA] No.

62
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,791
[NATSUME] I'm sorry for asking
to meet you so suddenly.

63
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,125
That's all right.

64
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:59,166
I kinda felt we needed
to talk in person anyway.

65
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,208
[HARUTORA] Could she
be his reincarnation?

66
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,458
I'm so sorry!

67
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,708
[HARUTORA] Huh?

68
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,083
About what you
texted to me earlier.

69
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,916
You were placed
in serious danger,

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,958
and it was all because
some horrid person

71
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,166
thought that you were me.

72
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,166
And then you
had to kiss her.

73
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,208
Are you talking about
Suzuka Dairenji?

74
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,000
Wait, I didn't
think you knew her.

75
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,250
[NATSUME]
I don't know her!

76
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:26,875
Okay. So then why do you
sorta seem to hate her?

77
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,375
Um...

78
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:31,125
Well, I've just heard that her
character is questionable.

79
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,166
But she is a prodigy,
and the youngest

80
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,125
to ever hold the rank of
Onmyo Mage First Class.

81
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,875
If she ended up
finding me,

82
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,208
I really don't know
what I would do.

83
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:41,958
[HARUTORA] Did you talk
to your dad about it?

84
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,083
[NATSUME]
Uh--No, I didn't.

85
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,625
He's actually gone to
Tokyo for a little while.

86
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,250
Oh, really?
I didn't know.

87
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:52,958
He had business there.
That's why I returned home.

88
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:56,500
[rain falls]

89
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,500
Wouldn't it be better for you
to go back to Tokyo, too?

90
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,625
I can't do that right now.

91
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:02,875
I have to stay.

92
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:06,416
The altar for the Taizan
Fukun Ritual is here.

93
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
The altar is on a mountain
behind the main house

94
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,375
called "Miyama."

95
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,791
She'll most likely try to
perform the ritual there.

96
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,125
And if that's the case,

97
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,750
then as the next
head of our family,

98
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,416
I've no choice but
to protect the altar.

99
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,541
Okay, but--

100
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,125
How can you do that
when you just said

101
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,166
you didn't know what to do?

102
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,708
This is not a matter
of what I know

103
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,416
or what I can and cannot do.

104
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,000
It is my responsibility.

105
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:31,791
With my father gone, I'm the
only one who can keep it safe!

106
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,166
[HARUTORA sighs]

107
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,625
Yeah, well, I still think you
should go back to Tokyo.

108
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,208
I will not
abandon the altar.

109
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,291
[HARUTORA] Fine, then
let me protect it.

110
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:42,625
Let you?

111
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,083
[HARUTORA] Suzuka Dairenji
wants you specifically.

112
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:48,500
Seems like a bad idea
to be hangin' around.

113
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,125
Look, you said this
is the responsibility

114
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,000
of the Tsuchimikado family,

115
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,166
so I'll do it in your place.

116
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,750
I'm part of the Tsuchimikado
family, too, after all.

117
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,166
Besides, the Onmyo
Agency is on it.

118
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,833
All you have to do is
find somewhere to hide

119
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,041
until that girl's caught.

120
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,875
Then, we won't have
anything to worry about.

121
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,958
Here. I stole these from
my dad's examination room.

122
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,541
Figured they'd come in handy.

123
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,666
Just a bunch of healing
and defense talismans.

124
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,583
[NATSUME] Why?

125
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,708
I don't understand.

126
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,708
Why only care about
the Tsuchimikado name

127
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,458
at a time like this?

128
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,333
Because it is
a time like this.

129
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:31,083
You know?

130
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,750
[NATSUME chuckles]

131
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,083
And believe me, you don't
have to worry at all.

132
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,083
My luck can suck pretty
hard and everything,

133
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,791
but the worst never happens.

134
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,083
I'll be fine.
Crazy girl is too cocky.

135
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,833
But she can be cute;
I'll give her that.

136
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,916
She can't be all that smart
if she mixed us up, though.

137
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,458
I bet I can talk
some sense into her.

138
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:50,916
[loud thud]

139
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,250
[NATSUME] Oh, really?

140
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,708
She can be cute?

141
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,375
That must be nice for you.

142
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,625
[HARUTORA shudders]

143
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,166
[NATSUME]
Seems your luck is changing

144
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,625
since your first kiss
was with a cute girl.

145
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,000
No, wait.
She's not cute!

146
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,750
[NATSUME]
I'm going home.

147
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,458
It would be pointless
to talk any longer.

148
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:11,500
Excuse me.

149
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,041
[HARUTORA]
No, hold on a second!

150
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,583
You think she likes you
so she'll listen to you!

151
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,166
You might as well not
try to help at all

152
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,416
if that's what you're thinking!

153
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,041
Come on. That's not even
what I said, Natsume!

154
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,916
[HARUTORA chokes]

155
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Are you all right?

156
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,833
Harutora, what's wrong?

157
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,375
[HARUTORA chokes]

158
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,666
A familiar?

159
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:47,041
Natsume? Natsume?

With the Laws of
the Five Elements,

320
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,250
break the walls within me.

321
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,083
Order!

322
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:51,416
[HARUTORA screams]

323
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,541
[HARUTORA]
Hokuto! Hokuto!

324
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,541
I called, but you didn't
answer your phone.

325
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,041
Stupid-tora.

326
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,791
Hokuto...

327
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,916
I'm sorry.

328
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,291
No, I'm sorry.

329
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:11,250
I hid the truth,
and tricked you.

330
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,041
[HARUTORA] You what?
I don't understand.

331
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,416
What is this?
What's going on?

332
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,541
[HOKUTO]
Harutora...

333
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,000
I love you.

334
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,625
That's all you need to know.

335
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,250
Listen to me.

336
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:30,166
Run away. Go, now.

337
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:36,625
If you die out here, I swear
that I'll never forgive you.

338
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:53,875
How gross.

339
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,458
I can't believe you made your
familiar be your girlfriend.

340
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:57,583
I'm still shocked
I couldn't tell.

341
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,416
[HARUTORA] Shut up.

342
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,750
Just shut up.

343
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,625
You should see
your face right now.

344
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,333
[SUZUKA] Next time,
I'll kill you, too.

345
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,125
[engine starts]

346
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:34,875
[HARUTORA] We first met
back in junior high.

347
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,000
[HARUTORA] It was
my first summer here.

348
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,458
I remember she acted a little
strange when she saw me.

349
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,000
[HOKUTO gasps]

350
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,791
[HARUTORA] From that day on,
whenever I turned around,

351
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,041
she always seemed
to be right there.

352
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:01,958
[HARUTORA] As soon as I saw her,
she'd just run away.

353
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,541
I started chasing after
her as kind of a joke,

354
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,083
and so that's how things went.

355
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:13,666
[HOKUTO laughs]

356
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,500
[HARUTORA laughs]

357
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,083
[HARUTORA] Then came the last
day of summer vacation.

358
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:22,083
[HARUTORA breathes heavily]

359
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,541
So I'm Harutora.

360
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:38,125
And I'm Hokuto!

361
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,291
[giggles]

362
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:42,125
[HARUTORA] She finally
told me her name.

363
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,458
[door opens]

364
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,291
[HARUTORA breathes heavily]

365
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:08,000
Natsume, has your spiritual
power come back, yet?

366
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,875
No, it hasn't
returned completely,

367
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,750
but I should have enough
to last the night.

368
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:16,041
You're still planning to
protect the altar by yourself?

369
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,375
I'm not gonna stop you.

370
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:23,125
But I need a favor.

371
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:27,375
Before you go, right now.

372
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,375
Make me your familiar.

373
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,750
[NATSUME gasps]

374
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,125
It's weird.

375
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,541
Going to school and
hanging out with friends.

376
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,708
That's all I ever wanted
out of life, you know?

377
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:44,041
I don't have talent,
and I'm not a seer.

378
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,166
But I've been so wrong.

379
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,875
I wish I was like you.

380
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,625
I didn't confront
my position at all.

381
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:53,541
Instead, I ran
away from myself.

382
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,708
[HARUTORA] Someone even
tried to tell me that,

383
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,833
but I wouldn't listen.

384
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,000
[HARUTORA] Please.

385
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
Stupid-tora.

386
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,791
You will agree then?

387
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,208
From this day forward,

388
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,125
you offer yourself up
to live as my familiar.

389
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:20,333
Are you prepared?

390
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,791
[HARUTORA] I am.

391
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:25,500
I will not hide anymore.

392
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:29,916
[NATSUME] Good.

393
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,375
Children hide from
what they fear.

394
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:34,750
And we are not children.

395
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:38,500
[NATSUME] Harutora.

396
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:42,083
I take you now and name
you as my familiar.

397
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,416
[NATSUME]
Close your eyes.

398
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,666
And now I,
Natsume Tsuchimikado--

399
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,416
--in the name of the
great Abe no Seimei--

400
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,500
--take you, Harutora
Tsuchimikado, as my familiar.

401
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:26,541
With this, you are mine.
Forever and always.

402
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:29,125
Take a look around
now, Harutora.

403
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,166
Can you see it?

404
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,083
[HARUTORA]
See what?

405
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,833
[HARUTORA gasps]

406
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:47,750
What? No way.

407
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:49,500
I used my magic
to help give you

408
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:50,958
the power to see spirits.

409
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:54,583
I guess it worked.
So what do you think?

410
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,500
[HARUTORA]
A spirit seer.

411
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:58,333
Amazing.

412
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:04,000
It's beautiful.

413
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:06,166
[KON] I'm stewing; I'm stewing;

414
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,291
I'm stewing for 2 more episodes;

415
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:10,958
I'm stewing; close the lid;
I'm stewing.
