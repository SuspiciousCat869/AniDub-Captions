the top of the Onmyo Bureau.

159
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,916
He unified the different
types of Japanese magics

160
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,208
as well as created
the extremely practical

161
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,125
Imperial style of Onmyo magic.

162
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:50,333
However, Yakou did not
achieve this acting alone.

163
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,708
[HARUTORA] Huh?

164
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,458
[KURAHASHI] Working with him
not only on Onmyo magic,

165
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,291
but on magic from other sects;

166
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:59,166
examining, sorting,
finding complements,

167
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,833
and creating a system,

168
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:04,791
were the powerful Tsuchimikado
branch family the Kurahashis

169
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,375
and the Souma family,

170
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:10,208
who had influence over
the Imperial army.

171
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,583
Souma...

172
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:14,625
If by the side of
Onmyo Mage, Tsuchimikado

173
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,000
stood Hishamaru
and Kakugyouki.

174
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:20,875
Then who stood by Tsuchimakado
as chief of the Onmyo Bureau?

175
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,791
And as the Head of Onmyo?

176
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:26,208
The answer is the
Kurahashis and the Soumas.

177
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,666
[KURAHASHI]
At one time, Tsuchimikado,

178
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,000
accompanied by
Kurahashi and Souma,

179
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:33,958
achieved the
revitalization of magic.

180
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,541
After that, they decided to
aim for even greater heights

181
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,500
and advancements,
but it was to no avail.

182
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,916
Things are different, now.

183
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So the Kurahashis
and Soumas are ready

184
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,375
to take over Yakou's
great work once more.

185
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:48,791
After all, they finally
have their king.

186
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,625
We request your cooperation.

187
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,875
[HARUTORA] I see.

188
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,041
That must be it.

189
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,583
Must be what?

190
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,416
[HARUTORA] The real reason I
was raised in a branch family.

191
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,375
[KURAHASHI grunts]

192
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,541
[HARUTORA]
The whole family.

193
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,166
They were all trying
to protect me.

194
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:10,916
[YASHAMARU] Kurahashi.

195
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,375
[KURAHASHI] Hm?

196
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:19,666
[phone rings]

197
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,583
We have company.

198
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:24,875
[MALE WORKER 22A] What the?

199
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,041
[DOMAN laughs intensely]

200
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:27,916
[MALE AGENT 22C] Uh. Ah!

201
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,166
[MALE AGENT 22B] An attack!

202
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,083
[MARI] Everyone.
Stay behind the barrier inside!

203
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,125
[MARI gasps]

204
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,291
D?

205
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,208
But how; I thought
Kogure purified him!

206
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,625
[DOMAN laughs]

207
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,083
[DOMAN]
Hm? That spirit energy

208
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,583
looks like it belongs
to a Divine General.

209
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,291
He's a child?

210
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:53,000
I can't believe it.
Is this D's true form?

211
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,041
[MARI whimpers]

212
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,291
[DOMAN laughs]

213
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,583
[MARI whimpers]

214
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,083
[DOMANS cackle]

215
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,083
[MARI] I can't.

216
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,958
How am I supposed
to purify this?

217
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,916
[DOMANS laugh]

218
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,333
[MARI gasps]

219
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:15,458
[DOMANS laugh]

220
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,708
[MARI] What's going on?

221
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,250
At this rate...

222
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,958
[phone rings]

223
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,875
[MIYACHI] Hello, Maririn?
You're here, right?

224
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,416
Yes!

225
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,083
[MIYACHI] Intensify the agency
barrier to maximum strength.

226
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,458
Right!

227
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:33,666
[MARI] Om, shuri mari mamari
mari shushuri sowaka!

228
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,750
[MARI gasps]

229
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:50,708
[DOMANS scream]

230
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:55,791
[DOMAN laughs]

231
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,791
[DOMAN] Wow, that was
terrifying, wasn't it?

232
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:01,666
There's almost no point
in asking, but...

233
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:06,458
To be sure, you are the
Flame Devil, are you not?

234
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,250
[MIYACHI] It is an
honor to meet you.

235
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,666
I am the Onmyo mage,
Iwao Miyachi.

236
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,250
[DOMAN] You saw
through his plan?

237
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,000
Very impressive.

238
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,583
Thank you,
but I had no idea

239
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,458
Shadow would bring
you out, Master.

240
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,750
What kind of magic could he
have used to make that happen?

241
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,291
Oh, no kind of magic.

242
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,500
We just happen to be texting
buddies, that's all.

243
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,083
"Texting buddies"?

244
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,875
You mean, that's all it takes
to bring out the great Doman?

245
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,791
Well, in that case, if
it's not too much to ask,

246
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,000
do you mind giving me
your number, as well?

247
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,000
Yeah, no problem;
you are welcome to it,

248
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:39,000
it doesn't come
very cheap however.

249
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:39,750
[MARI] Commander!

250
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,375
[MIYACHI laughs]

251
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,958
[MIYACHI] Sorry, Maririn.

252
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,666
I'm going to have to leave the
inside of the building to you.

253
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:50,083
Roger that, sir. And, please
stop calling me that name.

254
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,791
I must say, our enemy
is hardly a naïve one.

255
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,125
[OHTOMO sighs]

256
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:08,875
[KAGAMI] I have dreamed of
this moment so many times.

257
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,625
[KAGAMI] Un!

258
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,666
[OHTOMO] Not too bad.

259
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,333
Come on, teach, you don't
have to be so cold to me.

260
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:27,083
I came all the way out here
in the middle of the night.

261
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:30,041
You can at least play
with me a little.

262
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,375
[MIYACHI recites spell]

263
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:40,708
[DOMANS cackle]
[MIYACHI continues]

264
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,708
[SUZUKA] Go figure Doman
Ashiya, of all people,

265
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,208
would come back
to life right now!

266
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,750
We don't need to figure;
just be glad that he did.

267
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,458
While the Onmyo Agency is busy
trying to take care of him,

268
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,708
we'll get the
chance to go rescue

269
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:53,333
our idiot friend,
Harutora.

270
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,458
Guys, wait.

271
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,875
[SUZUKA gasps]
[TOUJI stammers]

272
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,500
Wait for what?

273
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,791
Kyoko?

274
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,041
Okay, what is it?

275
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,291
I don't entirely
know what myself.

276
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,750
But.

277
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:10,041
All righty, then, you can
stay here and be on standby.

278
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,333
Suzuka and I will go inside.

279
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,166
No, listen, that's not it.

280
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,666
Can you please
just hold on a sec?

281
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,875
Hey! Seriously?

282
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,875
Miyachi is holding
Master Doman back

283
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,125
at the front of
the agency building.

284
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,916
I have confirmed that Kagami
has made contact with Shadow

285
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,500
and is about to engage
in battle with him.

286
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,916
[YASHAMARU] Hm.
Then this is not the master

287
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,583
trying to get
revenge on his own.

288
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,166
[KURAHASHI] We should assume
he's on Shadow's side now.

289
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,833
I did not see this coming.

290
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,625
Miyachi can't move
at the moment.

291
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,916
The purification troops
from HQ are scrambling, too.

292
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,750
Only time can tell
what will happen.

293
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,958
And me?
What should I do?

294
00:14:57,041 --> 00:15:00,083
Oh, I think it best if you stay
with the princess on standby.

295
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,500
Whatever you say, sir.

296
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,083
[HARUTORA] Mister Ohtomo?

297
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,500
And Doman is working with him?

298
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,500
Based on that reaction,

299
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,375
it would seem you
know who Shadow is.

300
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,041
Does that mean you
also know the reason

301
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:16,166
he came here to
pay us this visit?

302
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,708
Were you aware
that your friends

303
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,291
are somewhere nearby as well?

304
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,875
What? Are you serious?

305
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,666
You've probably
realized this,

306
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,750
but they're not going
to like the idea of you

307
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:28,666
reviving Natsume Tsuchimikado
with forbidden magic.

308
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,916
Since we're not afraid
of breaking those taboos,

309
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,166
we're the only ones
who will help you.

310
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:37,458
[KURAHASHI] Harutora
Tsuchimikado.

311
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,375
I hate to admit this,
but there are still

312
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,583
a couple of misunderstandings
we need to deal with.

313
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,666
Unfortunately,
I can't reassure you

314
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,500
these matters will be easily
resolved down the road.

315
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:52,041
There is no way anyone can
be certain what is to come.

316
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,583
However, we have no
choice but to move forward.

317
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,500
We must continue
making decisions.

318
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,083
Especially if our
ambitions and desires

319
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:03,833
are as outrageous as bringing
the dead back to life.

320
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,750
Make your choice.

321
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,666
[HARUTORA]
All right. I'm in.

322
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,125
[KURAHASHI] Hm.

323
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,166
[YASHAMARU] Heh.

324
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,291
[KON] Please don't!

325
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,750
[HARUTORA] Uh!

326
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,333
[HARUTORA] Kon?
What are you doing?

327
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,500
[KON] M-Master Harutora,
I know this is impertinent,

328
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,875
but please listen to
what I have to say.

329
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,375
You must not trust
these people, sir!

330
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,625
That fact is as clear as day.

331
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,916
Please, rethink what
you're planning to do.

332
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,250
Listen to me;
you have to reconsider.

333
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,291
[KURAHASHI sighs]

334
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,375
[YASHAMARU] Heh.

335
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,875
[HARUTORA]
Yeah, believe me, Kon.

336
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,208
I'm well aware that
I can't trust them.

337
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,708
It's not a surprise;

338
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,750
they already know I don't
totally believe what they say.

339
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,333
But I don't have any
other choice here!

340
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,291
What I feel doesn't matter.
Besides, I'm using them, too!

341
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,791
[KON] You're wrong!

342
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:59,458
Look. M-Master Harutora, you
do not get what I'm saying!

343
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,208
The normal you
would've understood

344
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,000
without ever having
to think about it,

345
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:06,208
but the you right now
simply does not comprehend.

346
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,375
Please listen to me!

347
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,000
Trust is not a thing you can
compromise and give up on

348
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,458
because you have no other
choice at the moment.

349
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,375
It's also not something
you can give up on

350
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,583
when it is more convenient.

351
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,666
Kon! Stop it right now!

352
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,791
No. You have to
listen to me, sir!

353
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,333
If you took a moment
to look at them,

354
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,625
it would be
obvious to you, too!

355
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,541
Think about what these
people have already done

356
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,083
to those who were
close to them,

357
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,125
to allies who fought
beside them and for them.

358
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,708
Tell me, out of everyone
you've met or heard of

359
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,291
who've been considered one of
their precious "comrades,"

360
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:42,833
is there even a single person
that has been left smiling?

361
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:45,458
Master Harutora, your
smile will not be found

362
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:46,958
on the path you are
heading toward now,

363
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,541
and you know without a doubt
you can trust me on that.

364
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,708
And even if they
kept their word

365
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,333
and Natsume were
to be revived,

366
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:53,666
I seriously doubt she would

367
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,375
be able to
smile in the end, too.

368
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,041
Please, try to
remember her, sir.

369
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:03,291
When she died there was a
smile on her face, Master.

370
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,541
This would taint
that moment entirely.

371
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,625
Is that what you truly want?

372
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,041
[HARUTORA] Shut up!

373
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,041
What exactly do
you want me to do?

374
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,125
So just because she
smiled when she died,

375
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,000
everything's supposed
to be okay?

376
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,166
Well to hell with that;

377
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,916
I'm bringing Natsume
back no matter what!

378
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,500
Master Harutora!
If that is the case,

379
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:24,208
then you must not leave
this to any other person!

380
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,208
Take the matter into your very
own hands and do it yourself!

381
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:27,875
[HARUTORA gasps]

382
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:28,750
[KURAHASHI gasps]

383
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:29,916
[YASHAMARU grunts]

384
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,250
[KON] I mean, you are
the reincarnation

385
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,625
of Yakou Tsuchimikado,

386
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,250
the greatest authority
on magic dealing with souls,

387
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,416
are you not?

388
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,666
Think about it, sir;

389
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,958
even these bad men agree
that Yakou Tsuchimikado

390
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,500
perfected the current
Taizan Fukun Ritual.

391
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,458
If you are indeed
his reincarnation,

392
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,125
you should be able
to perform the ritual

393
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,208
better than anyone else.

394
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:52,666
But, I can't.
That's impossible.

395
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,708
I don't have those memories
from my past life, Kon!

396
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,583
It's not like I know
as much as he did.

397
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,458
No. There's no way
I would ever

398
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,250
be able to use the
Taizan Fukun Ritual.

399
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,125
[KON] Master Harutora.

400
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,666
Do you realize how
pitiful you sound?

401
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,541
Did you or did you not
just tell me you would

402
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,541
do anything to bring
her back, no matter what?

403
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,208
[HARUTORA stammers]

404
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,166
[KON] If your desire
in this extreme action

405
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,083
is to repay Natsume from a
genuine and heartfelt place,

406
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,291
then I think you
should take on

407
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,666
that responsibility
yourself, sir.

408
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,625
Why would you consider
leaving it to someone else?

409
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:27,541
And to scoundrels, no less!
It's inexcusable at best, sir!

410
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,500
Have you thought about
how Natsume would feel

411
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,958
if that was the way she was
brought back into the world?

412
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,958
By those who care
nothing for her?

413
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:37,000
However, if you brought
her back by yourself

414
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:40,333
instead of relying on people
that you know you can't trust.

415
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:43,666
No matter what the result,
Natsume would be happy.

416
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,750
I know without a doubt she would
show you her smile again, sir!

417
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,000
What do you say, kid?

418
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,083
You're time's up.

419
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:01,875
The Spirit Disaster Purification
Unit will arrive soon.

420
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:05,000
So, what will it be?

421
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,833
[HARUTORA sighs]

422
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,458
[KON gasps]

423
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,125
[HARUTORA] Kon.

424
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,125
[KON] Huh?

425
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,208
[HARUTORA]
Thank you for that.

426
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,208
[giggles]

427
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,916
[YASHAMARU] Ugh.
All that hubbub for nothing.

428
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,958
[KURAHASHI grunts]

429
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,833
And like that,
back to square one.

430
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,000
We can't seem to win, can we?

431
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:35,333
Oh well. Let's talk about the
future in the morning, shall we?

432
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,583
[HARUTORA and KON grunt]

433
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,041
[YASHAMARU] Hm.

434
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,875
[YASHAMARU] Uh! Huh?

435
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:48,166
Kurahashi, the seal on
the Coat has been broken.

436
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,083
It what?
But there's no way!

437
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,000
[YASHAMARU]
No, it wasn't those three.

438
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,708
I'm positive we would have
noticed if it had been them.

439
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,125
[KURAHASHI]
Then whom?

440
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,875
[AMAMI]
What a splendid defense!

441
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:02,208
I had a boy come to me,
as well, you know!

442
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,416
[KURAHASHI grunts]

443
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,416
[AMAMI] Tsuchimikado,
call the Raven Coat!

444
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,333
Raven Coat!

445
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,458
Come!

446
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,416
Yashamaru!

447
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,666
All right.

448
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,875
What a ruckus.

449
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:17,291
If you could stay still,
that'd be great.

450
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,291
Do your thing, Kon!

451
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,791
[KON yells]

452
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,750
[KON yells]

453
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,208
Uh!

454
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:27,916
[YASHAMARU] Oh dear.

455
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:32,166
Harutora, it'll be
hard for you to do

456
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,041
the Taizan Fukun Ritual
with that level of magic.

457
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,916
How dare you. Ahh!

458
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,875
Sit down, girl.

459
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,541
[KON] Aahh!

460
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,916
Om, bishi bishi kara
kara shibari sowaka!

461
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,250
[YASHAMARU grunts]

462
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,791
[chuckles]

463
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,416
That wasn't very nice.

464
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,500
You almost broke my monacle.

465
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,041
[HARUTORA gasps]

466
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:55,708
[KURAHASHI grunts]

467
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:01,625
[KURAHASHI] Ah.

468
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:04,083
That fan was
an armored familiar?

469
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,208
[HARUTORA] Uh. Go!

470
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,416
[KON] Hm.

471
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,750
[YASHAMARU] Namu,
