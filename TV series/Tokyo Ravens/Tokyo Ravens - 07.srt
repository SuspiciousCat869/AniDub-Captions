00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,166
[TENMA] Morning, guys!

2
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,625
[KYOKO] Hello, Natsume!

3
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:36,750
[TENMA] Well, we've
survived half our exams.

4
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,041
You guys ready for the next one?

5
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,708
[HARUTORA] ...which
invariably supersedes use

6
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,708
of a 2nd class general
purpose familiar...

7
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,333
[KYOKO] I take it
you studied all night?

8
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,208
Natsume's training
schedule leaves no time

9
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:46,500
for catching any Z's.

10
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,958
Listen, you're not gonna
be held back a year.

11
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,083
We'll do a last review
before your next attempt.

12
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,916
[HARUTORA] But I think my
brain's running out of storage.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,333
[NATSUME] Oh? You've memorized
enough to ace this test?

14
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,375
[HARUTORA]
Well... Maybe not.

15
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,625
If you get s-stumped trying
to th-think of an answer,

16
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:03,125
remember
I'm by your side!

17
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:04,625
Oh, yeah! Good call.

18
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:06,333
[TENMA] But that
would be cheating.

19
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,208
[KYOKO] You'd get held
back if they caught you.

20
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,625
[NATSUME] You moron! Don't you
dare stain the family name!

21
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,416
Chill out, I was just joking.

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,208
[NATSUME] If there's room for
'jokes' in that skull of yours,

23
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:15,458
we can knowledge-cram Pre-exam!

24
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:16,833
[HARUTORA] Sure, sure.
Whatever you say...

25
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:18,541
[NATSUME] Stupid-tora!
It's time to knuckle down!

26
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:19,666
[KON] Stupid-tora?
That's so rude!

27
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,583
[HARUTORA] C'mon,
we're gonna be late.

28
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:21,583
[NATSUME] Just concentrate!

29
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:23,541
[HARUTORA] I know,
stop worrying!

30
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,250
Hey, man. What is it?

31
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:28,875
Nothing.

32
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:32,833
[TOUJI] Six months
sped by so fast...

33
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:39,041
♪

34
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,083
[PROCTOR] Pens down! Pass
your papers forward, please.

35
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,333
So. How'd it go?

36
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,541
This blows.
I'm gonna fail.

37
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,208
Not yet! You can
pass the practicum!

38
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,208
Now's our chance!

39
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,541
[KON] Haaaa!

40
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,875
Gotcha!

41
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,083
[NATSUME] All right!

42
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,416
[TENMA] You've learned
a ton in six months.

43
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,583
Just look how much you've
improved, Harutora!

44
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,833
Master!
You were magnificent!

45
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,458
Well, I couldn't have done it
without your flawless timing!

46
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,708
[KON] It's an honor
and a privilege!

47
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,458
I don't deserve such
generous praise!

48
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,125
Under normal conditions,
my familiars

49
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,791
work as a pair, y'know.

50
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,208
You were victorious, Master.
Listening to a sore loser

51
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,333
like her is below a
man of your station.

52
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,541
I heard that, you rat!

53
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,541
[KON] Heard what?
You must be overtired.

54
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,208
Natsume! Looks like
I've got a chance

55
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,958
at passing this thing after all!

56
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,708
[NATSUME] Yeah? Well,
you rely far too much

57
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,166
on the staff to
convert magic for you!

58
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,291
The practical prohibits
the use of magic tools.

59
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,166
Talk about a buzzkill.

60
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,666
[TENMA] You didn't let any of
that stop you

61
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,041
from cheering for his victory.

62
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,958
Fine, I cheered.
But that's only because

63
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,041
I was caught up in the moment--

64
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,958
Never mind! Listen up!

65
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,458
Before tomorrow's
practical exam,

66
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,416
we're gonna drill your
magic-handling skills, got it?

67
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,000
[HARUTORA] Your momma's
gonna drill some magic skills.

68
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,333
Burn. Am I right?
Where's Touji?

69
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,833
[TENMA]
He's with the principal.

70
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,916
[TOUJI] Purification
of a spirit disaster?

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,416
Correct. It's a fine test of
skill for our practical exam.

72
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,208
You and your classmates
will be tasked with

73
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,375
quelling a simulated
spirit disaster.

74
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,291
[TOUJI] Why're you
telling me this?

75
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,875
[MIYO] Because you have
a handicap when it comes

76
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,083
to this type of testing.

77
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,875
Two years ago, you fell
victim to the spirit disaster

78
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,416
and have since struggled
with its aftereffects.

79
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,875
We have, of course, thoroughly
discussed the implications

80
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:57,375
of your exam with your
doctor, Harutora's father.

81
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:00,916
By the way, he's another
graduate of our fine school.

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,750
[TOUJI] Look, I
appreciate your concern,

83
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,375
but I don't need any sympathy.

84
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,708
[MIYO] Hm. That wasn't
my intent, I assure you.

85
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,583
[TOUJI] Sorry.
Sensitive subject.

86
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,750
When someone reminds
me I'm a spirit disaster victim,

87
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,666
I tend to get a
little bit annoyed.

88
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,958
Didn't mean to snap.
Thanks for the heads up.

89
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,625
I'll try to be careful.

90
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,166
[MIYO chuckles lightly]

91
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,416
[MUTOBE] I am
in your debt, sir.

92
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,625
[DOMAN] All I did was
prepare the pieces, my boy.

93
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,666
Still, seems like such a waste.

94
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,041
You don't plan to
survive this, do you?

95
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:34,416
I suppose it doesn't matter.
The show must go on.

96
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,833
[MUTOBE] The time has come.
Farewell, Doman.

97
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,208
Chief Dairenji.
Please watch over me now.

98
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:48,666
[HARUTORA] Hang on!
You can't be serious!

99
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,250
[NATSUME] I am! You're not
sleeping tonight. Sorry!

100
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,250
[laughter]

101
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,250
[HARUTORA] But that's not fair!

102
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,250
[MUTOBE] King of
the North Star...

103
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,333
[HARUTORA] Have a heart!

104
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,958
[MUTOBE] I pledge
my soul to you.

105
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,375
[MUTOBE] That boy...

106
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,083
[OHTOMO] Sir, I don't
think the taxpaying public

107
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,583
would approve of our meeting
in a place like this.

108
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,916
Take it easy, it's not
like that at all!

109
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,041
I paid for everything myself.

110
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,666
Tell me. Is Miyo as
stubborn as ever?

111
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,708
[OHTOMO] Principal Kurahashi?
She's quite the taskmaster.

112
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,125
[AMAMI laughs]

113
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,500
She may look sweet, but she's
not beyond using people.

114
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:30,083
[OHTOMO] MIB'S gotten some
negative press lately.

115
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,875
[AMAMI] If we worried about
what other people thought,

116
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,500
we'd never get anything done!

117
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,500
Well? Why did you call for me?

118
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,416
I already turned in my
resignation, Director Amami.

119
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,791
I don't work for you anymore.

120
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,958
[AMAMI] I crumpled it up
and threw it away. You don't

121
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:46,250
honestly think a little scrap of
paper makes us even, do you?

122
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:51,875
[OHTOMO] Incorrigible.
So? Who're you hiding?

123
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:57,000
Oh, him? That one's our
new hope. Atsune Hirata.

124
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,375
Current director of our Twin
Horn Syndicate investigation.

125
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:03,000
Long story short,
he's your successor.

126
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,083
It's nice to meet you,
Mister Ohtomo.

127
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,166
I've heard quite
a lot about you.

128
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,750
And most of it
unflattering, I'd wager.

129
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,458
[HIRATA] Right hand man of
our current Divine General

130
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,666
"Divine Fan" Daizen Amami

131
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,416
and former member of the
Twelve Divine Generals,

132
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,041
Jin Ohtomo.
AKA "Shadow."

133
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,500
I am honored to make
your acquaintance, sir.

134
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,083
[AMAMI] The kid's a natural!

135
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,083
Honest! Figured
it out himself!

136
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,875
I told him to keep a lid on it,
so stop worrying.

137
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,291
[HIRATA] If I may...

138
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,208
[HARUTORA sighs]

139
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,208
I can't remember
when I last ate.

140
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,458
You've worked hard,
so enjoy it, Master.

141
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,041
Thanks for the grub!

142
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,750
Eh... Uh?

143
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,416
[NATSUME] I'd love to know
what you think you're doing.

144
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,916
There are things you should
be filling your brain with.

145
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,208
Which means there's
no time for you

146
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,333
to bother with
filling your stomach.

147
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,500
What? You're a monster.

148
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,875
[KON] How dare you interrupt
my master's meal?!

149
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,000
Even from you,
it's unforgivable!

150
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,833
[NATSUME] Have you forgotten?
I'm his master!

151
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,833
[KON] And I'm telling you,
it's unpardonable!

152
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,500
[NATSUME] Everyone else
has gone without food or rest.

153
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,958
I haven't eaten a thing!

154
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,125
[KON] Well then, that makes
two of us suffering!

155
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,416
[NATSUME] Don't even! I'm
working way harder than you!

156
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,750
[KON] You can't be serious!

157
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:11,750
[NATSUME] You bet I am!

158
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:12,916
[KON] That's it!...

159
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,916
[HARUTORA] What is he doing?

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,375
[HIRATA] Two years have passed
since the terrorist attack.

161
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,166
The Great Purification spirit
disaster was perpetrated

162
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,333
by the Twin Horn Syndicate under
the guise of the Ghost Division.

163
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:26,375
[HIRATA] Their former organizer,
Shido Dairenji, is deceased.

164
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,000
The Ghost Division disbanded.

165
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:31,625
However, the Twin Horn Syndicate
still maintains a presence.

166
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:35,250
Terrorist scum. They're too
cowardly to show their faces.

167
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,291
[HIRATA] Of course, I'm sure
you knew this already.

168
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,250
Right, "Shadow"?

169
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,708
Look, kid. You've really gotta
stop calling me "Shadow."

170
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,583
I resigned from that
job, kay? I'm just

171
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,375
a regular old schoolteacher
these days, that's all.

172
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,958
[AMAMI] A schoolteacher
with whom I'd like

173
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,416
to conduct business.
If I'm not mistaken,

174
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,791
you have a student
named Tsuchimikado.

175
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,208
Well, well. I never
would have thought

176
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:58,083
you'd take teaching
so seriously, Ohtomo.

177
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,666
I take it very seriously.
Especially after cleaning up

178
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,250
the sizable mess you
made six months ago.

179
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,666
Don't I know!

180
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,750
Miyo gave me all kinds of
hell after that incident.

181
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,000
You're barking
up the wrong tree.

182
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,875
I'm finished with
that kind of work.

183
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,750
We're short-handed,
to be frank.

184
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,291
We have Kogure
working nonstop as it is.

185
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,416
[OHTOMO] Perfect.
He's very capable.

186
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,166
He should be, he's a
former classmate of yours.

187
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,750
And you might be
interested to know,

188
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:24,750
the work Kogure's done for us
has kept Kagami on the bench.

189
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,791
[OHTOMO] Is that so?
The Principal's son

190
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:30,208
is the head of the Exorcism
Bureau now, correct?

191
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,625
So tell me.
Has he discovered

192
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,541
some new way to tame that
self-absorbed little brat?

193
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:39,208
Consider the vitriolic little
S.O.B. chained and collared.

194
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:42,666
But I know better than to remove
the fangs of a guard dog.

195
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,416
Look. Why don't you just tell
me why you called me here?

196
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,041
I'd rather we cut to the
chase and save some time.

197
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:52,166
The Twin Horn Syndicate
is planning something new.

198
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,166
Something big.

199
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,541
Wait, do you mean he's back?

200
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,916
[HIRATA] There's no doubt it
was D. He was recently spotted

201
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,083
in the area, contacting a member
of the Twin Horn Syndicate.

202
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:05,291
His contact was Chihiro
Mutobe, a mage formerly with

203
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:09,375
the Ghost Division, and right
hand man to Shido Dairenji.

204
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,083
[MIYO] To put it bluntly, I have
a hard time reading your stars.

205
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,083
That's due to
the aftereffects.

206
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,833
And I'm afraid all I can see
is overwhelming confusion

207
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,000
awaiting you in
the future, Touji.

208
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,500
I cannot offer you
any help directly.

209
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,708
But I can teach you
to marshal your energy

210
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,375
so that you may master it
when the time comes.

211
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,541
My sincere hope is that
doing so gives you

212
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,000
a chance to live life
on your own terms.

213
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,166
[TOUJI]
That's nice and all.

214
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,750
But as far as
living my life goes,

215
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,750
it's not like I'm making any
long-term plans or anything.

216
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,875
Not now. That's fair.

217
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,916
Please think about
what I shared with you.

218
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
After all, it's not smart to
limit any future possibilities.

219
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,875
Future possibilities.
Right. What are those?

220
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,791
[door opens]

221
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,750
[HARUTORA] Yo!

222
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,083
Hey, what's up?

223
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,958
[HARUTORA] What're you
doing up here alone, man?

224
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,666
You look all broody. You wanna
cigarette or something?

225
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,083
I have a no-smoking policy,
Your Dweebness.

226
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,166
[HARUTORA] So what?
You can't sleep?

227
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,333
[TOUJI] I could ask
the same of you.

228
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,875
Is Natsume's special
training finished?

229
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,000
[HARUTORA]
Yeah. Sort of.

230
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,583
[NATSUME] Waffles...

231
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,291
[HARUTORA] I can't believe
tomorrow's practical

232
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,625
is a spirit disaster
purification.

233
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,041
[TOUJI] No biggie.
It's just a simulation.

234
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,416
With the whole class involved,
it shouldn't be that hard.

235
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,333
[HARUTORA] And Natsume
only has to watch.

236
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:42,666
She lucked out.

237
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,208
[TOUJI] That just means
they don't think she needs

238
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:47,750
to prove anything. The school
works on a merit system.

239
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,083
[HARUTORA] Yeah,
I guess the test is just

240
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,541
for the normal losers
like us, huh?

241
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,625
Wow. We are so not in
the country anymore.

242
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,875
For real.

243
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,750
So how bout it, man?
Anything new with you?

244
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:00,791
[TOUJI] Same as you.

245
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,166
No. You know
what I'm asking.

246
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,041
What, the aftereffects?

247
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,250
[HARUTORA] Yeah.

248
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,916
I don't have anything
new to report, sir.

249
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,750
Just the same crap as before.

250
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:12,166
Except now I'm more aware
of spirit energy, I guess.

251
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,916
So, what? Does that mean
you can control it now?

252
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,041
[TOUJI] Probably.
I know you're worried

253
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,916
about what it'll turn into,
but there's no need for that.

254
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,750
Your father's treatment
is working out perfectly.

255
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,333
And I'll be careful.

256
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,666
[HARUTORA] Of course.

257
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,916
[TOUJI] After all, it's your
job to go overboard.

258
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,291
Yeah, I excel at taking things
a little too far, don't I?

259
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,666
At least you're aware of it.
That saves us some time.

260
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,458
Yeah? Your momma's
aware, bro.

261
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:40,583
[TOUJI and HARUTORA laugh]

262
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:42,958
Peace. I'm out.

263
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,500
Cool.

264
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:51,333
[HARUTORA] Hey, dude. Let's kick
that test's butt tomorrow!

265
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:54,000
That's a pretty good idea if
you don't wanna get held back.

266
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,250
Right!
No pressure, huh?

267
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,166
I'll worry about it
after I wake up.

268
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,041
[door opens and closes]

269
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,291
Seriously.

270
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,250
Like father, like son.

271
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,083
I get check ups from both
of them like clockwork.

272
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,041
[FUJIHARA] And now
we will commence

273
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,625
with the practical exam.

274
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,166
[STUDENTS] Yes, sir!

275
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:53,875
[KYOKO] Good. Hang on!
Just a bit longer!

276
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,125
Oh, man.

277
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,916
Don't freak out on me now.
Take a deep breath.

278
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,583
Or not. Is it the breathing
that's making you sick?

279
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,916
Master! Give the word, and
I'll do whatever you need!

280
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,375
No, I can do it!

281
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,125
Get a hold of yourselves!
Let's take our time and make

282
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:11,083
sure this gets done correctly
or what's the point, right?

283
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,416
How are you doing
over there, Touji?

284
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,083
I'm fine. No problems here.
I'm in complete control.

285
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,416
[HARUTORA]
Rin! Pyo! Tou! Sha!

286
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,583
[FEMALE STUDENT 7A]
You're being too forceful!

287
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:21,708
Kai!

288
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:22,583
[FEMALE STUDENT 7B]
Now it's too weak!

289
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:23,750
Jin!

290
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,625
Would you stabilize
your output already?

291
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,500
[HARUTORA]
Hey! It's not my fault!

292
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,375
I never volunteered for
the tic-tac-toe mantra job!

293
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,750
Sir! Please let me in,
they need me!

294
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,500
No. This is the best way
for them to realize

295
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,708
how much power they are
capable of wielding.

296
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,333
[HARUTORA] That's not
fair and you know it!

297
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,791
[FEMALE STUDENT 7B]
This is strange!

298
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,458
[FEMALE STUDENT 7C] The spirit
energy's getting stronger.

299
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,000
[STUDENTS scream]

300
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:48,125
[KYOKO] Everyone strengthen
the barrier! We must contain it!

301
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,791
[MALE PROCTOR 7A] Barrier group,
maintain present conditions!

302
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,000
[MALE PROCTOR 7B]
Purification group,

303
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,875
retreat behind
the barrier, now!

304
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,875
Well done.
Hold on a bit longer.
