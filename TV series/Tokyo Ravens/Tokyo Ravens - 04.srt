1
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,041
[HARUTORA chuckles]

2
00:00:56,625 --> 00:01:00,125
[HARUTORA] Man...
the sky is so blue.

3
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,416
[HARUTORA] So this
is Onmyo Prep...

4
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,875
Not bad.

5
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,083
From what I've heard,

6
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,625
everything they have
is top of the line...

7
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,625
Guess when it comes to
training onmyo mages,

8
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,625
the elite don't
pull their punches.

9
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:44,666
[HARUTORA] This hasn't
really sunk in yet...

10
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:51,125
[ALPHA] Harutora Tsuchimikado
and Touji Ato?

11
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,583
Did that thing talk?

12
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:53,666
I think they're familiars.

13
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,333
[OMEGA]
We are Alpha and Omega.

14
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,416
High-grade artificial familiars.

15
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,458
[ALPHA] We have confirmed and
registered your spirit energy.

16
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:03,750
You may now devote yourselves
to becoming good onmyo mages.

17
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,583
[HARUTORA]
This place is ridiculous.

18
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,750
[OMEGA]
Harutora Tsuchimikado...

19
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,708
I have also registered
your familiar.

20
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,291
Huh? I don't know
what that means.

21
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,541
[MIYO] Welcome to Onmyo
Preparatory School.

22
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:23,458
Please come to the principal's
office immediately.

23
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:30,750
I'm Miyo Kurahashi...
and I'm the principal here.

24
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,458
I suppose the two
of you must be

25
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:36,625
Natsume's Hishamaru
and Kakugyouki.

26
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,041
You've heard the rumors,
too, haven't you?

27
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,375
About Natsume...?

28
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,041
They're saying she's
the reincarnation

29
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,125
of Yakou Tsuchimikado.

30
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,833
The "unfortunate"
attention Natsume receives

31
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,708
will probably be directed
at you now, as well.

32
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:52,166
We are certainly here if
you should need our help...

33
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,583
However...

34
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,458
I hope you can learn to
tolerate it as soon as possible.

35
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,583
Natsume has managed to.

36
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,041
[HARUTORA] I never thought
about how much crap

37
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:04,125
she must've been putting
up with this whole time.

38
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,375
So, let me ask you boys

39
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,041
what impression do
you have of Yakou?

40
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,625
He's an old,
famous relative

41
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,458
who's kind of annoying...?

42
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,666
I mean, he caused like
a lot of trouble, right?

43
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,916
[MIYO]
What about you?

44
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,583
[TOUJI]
Just the facts...

45
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,583
Back during the war,
he used his skills to develop

46
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,916
Imperial Onmyo Magic at
the request of the military.

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,375
Right before we
were defeated,

48
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,458
he completely screwed
up a magic ritual...

49
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:33,583
and that was what caused all
the spirit disasters in Tokyo.

50
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,375
He had good
and bad points

51
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,708
so it's kinda hard to express
him in a single word...

52
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:42,750
He was a genius...
I know that.

53
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,833
He liked to play shogi.

54
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,833
Although, he wasn't very good.

55
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:51,333
I think he liked it more
because he was bad at it...

56
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,125
He was always asking
people to play with him.

57
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,041
He would sulk when he lost...

58
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:59,041
and that didn't necessarily
go over well with everyone.

59
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,000
[TOUJI gasps]

60
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,000
You mean you've met him before?

61
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,458
I was only a child
at the time, but yes,

62
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,625
I have met him...

63
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:06,916
Yakou was human...

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,041
a regular guy,
just like you boys...

65
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,416
It seems sometimes
people forget that fact.

66
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,958
And worse...

67
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,666
there are more than a few that
refuse to accept the truth.

68
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,958
They're called
"Yakou devotees"...

69
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,166
they ignore his humanity...

70
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,208
blindly putting
him on a pedestal.

71
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,250
They are still
obsessed with him...

72
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,958
and have even tried to
make contact with Natsume.

73
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,625
[HARUTORA]
With Natsume?!

74
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,666
[MIYO] Remember, an impression
is one type of magic...

75
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,541
Rumors are yet another...

76
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:41,083
They affect people and can
very easily mislead them.

77
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,208
[knocking]

78
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,208
[OHTOMO] Principal?

79
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:47,250
My apologies, but please...

80
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:50,166
Tell me this whole thing
isn't gonna take much longer.

81
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,708
Not much longer at all...

82
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,208
We've actually just finished up.

83
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,375
[OHTOMO] Heh. Like it...?

84
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,041
Pretty awesome, doncha think?

85
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,166
I happen to be a sorry
excuse for an onmyo mage...

86
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,791
so I kinda like to bluster
around a little bit.

87
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,375
[HARUTORA]
This guy is weird...

88
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,291
Meet Mister Jin Ohtomo...

89
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,250
He'll be your homeroom
teacher this year.

90
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,375
Huh?!

91
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,416
Hey, what was
that reaction for?

92
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,958
[footsteps]

93
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,875
[OHTOMO]
Don't let her fool ya...

94
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,750
She's not just in charge here...

95
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,250
That old lady is
pulling more strings

96
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,875
than you can shake a stick at.

97
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,875
Who's Hishamaru
and Kakugyouki...?

98
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:26,166
The principal asked us if we
were Natsume's version of them.

99
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,208
[OHTOMO] Those are the names
of Yakou's familiars.

100
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,166
They were always
by Yakou's side...

101
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,791
and they did whatever
it took to protect him.

102
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,833
By all accounts, they
were incredibly strong.

103
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:48,125
Well, get on with it,
guys; greet your class.

104
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,500
Harutora Tsuchimikado... Hello.

105
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,375
And I'm
Touji Ato.

106
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,625
You're not gonna sell
yourselves any more than that?

107
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,083
[HARUTORA] Like it would
make a difference.

108
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,625
[HARUTORA] Natsume?

109
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,666
Sorry... didn't mean
to keep you waiting.

110
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,333
Now, Harutora and Touji
are behind the rest of you

111
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,208
by half a year, so please
help them out when you can.

112
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,708
[KYOKO] Excuse me!

113
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:13,833
[OHTOMO]
What's up, Kyoko?

114
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,250
You got a problem?

115
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,083
Maybe it's just me,
but uh...

116
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,500
a new transfer seems strange
at this time of year...

117
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,416
Wouldn't they like normally have
to wait for a new semester?

118
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,666
Did the Tsuchimikado family
have something to do with this?

119
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,791
If so, I don't
think that's fair!

120
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:31,375
[students whisper indistinctly]

121
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,583
[thud]

122
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,250
[NATSUME] These accusations
are outrageous.

123
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,041
Uh oh.

124
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,333
This won't be good.

125
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,375
[NATSUME]
Kyoko Kurahashi,

126
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,958
you've insulted the
Tsuchimikado family...

127
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,625
Apologize to him and to me!

128
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,916
If that's how you're going
to be, then bring it...

129
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,958
Confess...

130
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,958
I heard he's really
your familiar!

131
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,000
We have to assume
he's only a student

132
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,208
so you can have your
familiar nearby, right?

133
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,333
Why else would he
even enroll here?

134
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,583
Heh.

135
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,750
[NATSUME] Then, are you
accusing Onmyo Prep

136
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,666
of bowing to the whims
of a lowly student?

137
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,875
[KYOKO]
You're not lowly!

138
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,250
You're the next head
of the Tsuchimikados.

139
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,958
[NATSUME] Oh don't
start with that...

140
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,000
You know the current
Tsuchimikado family

141
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,666
is practically ruined.

142
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,000
As a matter of fact,
your family's the only one

143
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,000
who could get away with
something like that.

144
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,791
[KYOKO] Huh...?

145
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,125
More importantly...

146
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,166
your little opinion on
why they're enrolled here

147
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,583
doesn't matter in
the slightest...

148
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,375
My family doesn't care...

149
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,541
and I seriously doubt
the school does.

150
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,500
Huh?!

151
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,208
[HARUTORA]
Wow, she's cocky...

152
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:35,500
Look at her face; she totally
thinks she won this.

153
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,958
So uh...

154
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,583
...are you going to
stop them or what?

155
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,875
Whoopsie... I forgot
what I was doing.

156
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,791
[HARUTORA] Guess we
can't count on him...

157
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,333
You got any thoughts?

158
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:56,500
Wait, you look happy
about this, too!

159
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,625
What is wrong with everyone?!

160
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,583
Try not to let Kyoko
get to you, okay...?

161
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,416
You have every
right to be here.

162
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,916
[HARUTORA] Yeah...
sure I do.

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,666
Something tells me that girl
must always be freaking out.

164
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,166
Oh, yeah...

165
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,791
but what happened earlier
wasn't exactly a normal thing...

166
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,416
I don't usually get all
bent out of shape like I did.

167
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,458
Yes, never;
of course you don't.

168
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,791
This is weird...

169
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,500
Why are you two
acting so familiar?

170
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,333
I mean, you just met yesterday.

171
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,041
What's the problem,
Harutora,

172
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,541
are you
gettin' jealous?

173
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,833
What does it matter
to you, anyhow?

174
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:34,208
[HARUTORA] I dunno.
You okay?

175
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,458
Yep...

176
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,000
But there's really
nothing to worry about...

177
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,541
No need to
be jealous...

178
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,083
I can be
friendly to Touji

179
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,541
without knowing
him all that well.

180
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,500
Guess so.

181
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,125
Yeah...
And plus, um...

182
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:49,291
If I had to pick the
person I'm closest to...

183
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,416
Then I'd pick you, Harutora!

184
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,666
Huh?

185
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,625
[TENMA] Natsume!

186
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,083
Time for your
individual training.

187
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,375
Sorry, I have to go...

188
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:03,041
I'm studying a special
curriculum in another classroom.

189
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,375
[NATSUME]
Oh, hey, you guys?

190
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:11,583
I am really glad that
you two are here.

191
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:12,708
Yeah. Me too.

192
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,583
Sure, man.

193
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,958
Maybe it's the boys'
clothes, but uh...

194
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,791
she seems way less
mature than normal.

195
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,833
But like...
not in a bad way.

196
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,458
What ever you say,
dude...

197
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,583
now how bout it...?

198
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,500
Let's investigate.

199
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,250
Thank you for the food.

200
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,791
[TOUJI] What's up, man;
how's it going...?

201
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,291
I was wondering if
you could tell me

202
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,625
more about the school
and like class stuff...

203
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:37,291
What's your name?

204
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,208
Huh...? Who, me...?

205
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,833
I'm Tenma...
Tenma Momoe.

206
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,208
[HARUTORA]
Can I join you, too?

207
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,250
[TENMA gasps]

208
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,208
Quit being creepy,
Harutora...

209
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,583
So, Tenma, did you hear
about that rogue onmyo mage

210
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:49,958
out in the countryside?

211
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,666
Believe it or not, we sorta
got involved in that.

212
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,833
Huh? Are you serious?

213
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,583
[TENMA] So that's
what happened...

214
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:01,041
must've been pretty
difficult for you guys.

215
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,416
Yeah, I guess...

216
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,166
Anyway... That angry
girl from before...?

217
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,000
What family is she
a member of again?

218
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,250
Kyoko...?

219
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,041
Oh, she's a member of
the Kurahashi family.

220
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,875
Kurahashi...
Like the principal?

221
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,291
[TOUJI]
Miyo Kurahashi.

222
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:17,250
She's the doyenne of
the Kurahashi family.

223
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:20,291
[TENMA] Kyoko is actually the
principal's granddaughter...

224
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,583
Oh, and her father's
pretty important...

225
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,958
He's the current head
of the Onmyo Agency.

226
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,166
Wow, her family is
really distinguished!

227
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,416
Mmhm. But historically
the Tsuchimikado family

228
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,458
has actually had
a higher status.

229
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:36,041
That's probably why she thinks
of Natsume as her rival...

230
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,708
They're both so much smarter
than the rest of the school...

231
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,458
and I think they're
the only ones who have

232
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,916
defense familiars, too.

233
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,208
Defense familiars?

234
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,833
Still, I was pretty
surprised...!

235
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,583
I've never seen
Natsume get worked up

236
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,583
about anything like
he did earlier...

237
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,833
He always seems so calm
like nothing gets to him.

238
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,166
[NATSUME] I do not
have time to waste

239
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,000
by spending my days
idly or making friends.

240
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,708
You must be like pretty
important to him, huh...?

241
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,875
I mean, for him
to get so upset...

242
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,708
that was crazy.

243
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:09,583
Stupid-tora...
Are you an idiot?

244
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,166
I knew you were dumb,
but I didn't know

245
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,958
you were "should have never been
accepted into this school" dumb!

246
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,375
You didn't...?

247
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,083
I did.

248
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,291
[NATSUME grunts angrily]

249
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,708
[NATSUME]
Fine, Intense training for you!

250
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,666
We're going to make up
for the sixteen years

251
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,125
you completely wasted!

252
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,625
First, from An Intro to
General Onmyo Magic...

253
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,875
memorize the different types
of "Onmyo Magic Type Two."

254
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,458
And don't worry;

255
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,833
I know a spell that will let you
function without any sleep...

256
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,416
If you don't mind the
traumatic side effects,

257
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,333
you can easily stay awake
for an entire week!

258
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,666
[HARUTORA] Side effects?
What?! What are they?

259
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,916
What's gonna happen to me?

260
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,666
Hate to interrupt ya, but...

261
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,458
Oh... is it
that time already?

262
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:49,541
Guess we'll have to do
that intense training later.

263
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,000
[NATSUME] Borrow those
books from the library

264
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,250
and make sure you read them!

265
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,333
I wonder if there's
a spell out there

266
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,000
that could make a guy
like me smarter...

267
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:04,208
[TOUJI] Don't take this the
wrong way, but probably not.

268
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,416
[HARUTORA] Wow, thanks...

269
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:15,000
[HARUTORA] How long can
I keep going like this...?

270
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,875
Oh, yeah...

271
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,458
I've still got the familiar
Dad gave me as a goodbye...

272
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,958
Now, how am I supposed to
get this thing to work.

273
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,291
Huh?

274
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,916
[KON] Oh wow, it's an honor to
meet you for the first time!

275
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You can call me K-Kon...!

276
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,333
Nice to meet you!

277
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,166
I-I have...

278
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,541
I have been charged
with the task

279
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,750
of protecting you,
Master Harutora.

280
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:52,166
I am still inexperienced,
but I hope that...

281
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,041
that you will understand!

282
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,250
Hold on
a second...

283
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,458
You mean
you're a familiar?

284
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,875
[HARUTORA] This is the
familiar Dad gave me?

285
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,458
Wow.

286
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,416
So why did you pop
out all of a sudden?

287
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,416
[KON] I was making
myself invisible

288
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,125
when I heard your voice,
so I became visible...

289
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:12,250
Wait... you mean you've been
like hiding this whole time?

290
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,416
Oh yes!

291
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,625
I had to because I must
always and forever

292
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,625
protect Master Harutora!

293
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,083
[OMEGA]
Harutora Tsuchimikado,

294
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,166
I have also registered
your familiar.

295
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,708
I... I don't really
remember it...

296
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,500
but your branch of
the Tsuchimikado family

297
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,333
has used me at some
point in the past.

298
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,500
You're saying I'm not the
first person in my family

299
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,000
you've appeared to?

300
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,583
All right, Kon...

301
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,041
How about you show off all the
cool stuff you can do for me?

302
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,833
Oh, yes, sir!
Invisibility!

303
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,791
Awesome...!
I can't see you at all!

304
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,208
Whoa... Cool!

305
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,500
[KON] It's because I'm separated
from reality right now.

306
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,791
Niice! That's a
great trick, Kon!

307
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,666
Thank you...

308
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,500
it was no big deal, though...

309
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:55,916
[HARUTORA]
What else?

310
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,291
I can fly in the air, too!

311
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,708
[HARUTORA] Ooohh!

312
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:00,833
What else, what else?

313
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,625
Ma-Manipulate fire!

314
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,041
That's real fire!
Anything else?

315
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:08,083
Huh? Lemme think...

316
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:16,083
I can turn any enemy of
Master Harutora's into rust...

317
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:19,083
My beloved sword, Kachiwari,
takes care of that!

318
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,541
Well, okay...
Understood...

319
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,125
And thank you...

320
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,958
Think you can put the
sword away now, please?

321
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,375
[KON] Huh? Yes, Master.

322
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,250
[HARUTORA sighs]

323
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,125
There's something
you should know...

324
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,708
I'm kinda new at this whole
magic world thing...

325
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,458
I honestly don't know
if I'll even be able

326
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,625
to use you properly.

327
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,000
What are you saying...

328
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:44,125
Does that mean that...

329
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,166
Do-Does that mean
that you don't need me?

330
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,125
[HARUTORA] No, no, no;
that's not it...!

331
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,000
It's just that I'm basically
like an apprentice right now.

332
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm not a person you
should be bowing to.

333
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,291
[KON] No, that's
not true at all!

334
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,500
I was by your side and I
watched you for the whole day!

335
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,750
Then you should
know the truth...

336
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,291
[KON] I do...

337
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:06,041
And I am proud to be
Master Harutora's familiar.

338
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,750
[KON] Um...
Am I being a bother?

339
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,458
A bother...?
No way...

340
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,416
I'll be counting
on you from now on.

341
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,416
Oh, well that's good
to know; same here!

342
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,250
By the way what's the deal
with your ears and that tail?

343
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,125
[KON] Oh...
I'm a spirit fox.

344
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,875
Hmm...

345
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:29,000
Uh... you mind
if I touch 'em?

346
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,500
It's cool if you
don't want me to.

347
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:35,416
No; it's not that I
don't want. That is, I...

348
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,833
Well go ahead...

349
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,208
Really? Cool!

350
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,833
Oh, they're so fluffy!

351
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,750
Like my dog at home...! Hah, ha!

352
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,500
Can I touch your tail, too?

353
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,583
Oh, of course.

354
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:48,875
Oh wow...

355
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,791
This is a pretty
amazing tail, Kon!

356
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,125
Thank you...

357
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:56,416
I am delighted that you...
are having so much fun.

358
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,666
[HARUTORA] You can move this
however you want, right...?

359
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,583
How does it work?

360
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,000
How what...?

361
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,291
Well uh...

362
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:08,291
It... works... like...

363
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:08,958
Hm?

364
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,666
[KON] Like...

365
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,875
It works like this!

366
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,208
[NATSUME] Harutora...!

367
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,916
You didn't check out any
of the books I gave you--

368
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,250
Aaaahhh!

369
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,583
[HARUTORA yells]

370
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,208
Listen, this is so not
what it looks like...!

371
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,166
You have to believe me...!
Please, Natsume!

372
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,250
[NATSUME] What do you
think you're doing?

373
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,375
Nothing... Nothing!

374
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,791
Looks like you need a dose
of Pervert Punishment...!

375
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,291
Pervert Punishment...!

376
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,083
Order!

377
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,625
[HARUTORA screams]

378
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,500
[OGRE 4A] It's having more
of an effect than expected.

379
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,958
[MAGIC INVESTIGATOR 4A]
Yes it is, unfortunately.

380
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,166
[OGRE 4A] Don't you
think the people

381
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,250
of the organization
are being too careful?

382
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:02,291
After all, the king has
already been vindicated.

383
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,416
[MAGIC INVESTIGATOR 4A] We would
like to continue being cautious

384
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,583
for a while longer if possible.

385
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,708
[OHTOMO]
Pretty handy, isn't it?

386
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,750
After reaching the
Independent Exorcist Class,

387
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,125
taking care of a Phase 2
is really just that simple.

388
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,791
I'm surprised she
didn't kill me...

389
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,958
[OHTOMO] What are you spacing
out about, Harutora?

390
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,458
Uh--Uh?

391
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,833
You feelin' all right;
you look a little tired there.

392
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,583
[HARUTORA] No...
I'm fine; sorry.

393
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,791
[KYOKO] Um, sir...

394
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,250
Could you continue with
the lecture please?

395
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,833
I'd rather not waste more
time than we already have...

396
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,708
It's not my fault
people are so behind.

397
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,750
[OHTOMO] Hm. So you're saying
we should abandon students

398
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,125
who can't keep up? Yes?

399
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,666
That's right.

400
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,083
[OHTOMO] After all, there's
really no point in Onmyo Prep

401
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:44,750
rescuing anyone who won't be
useful in the future, is there?

402
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,125
The "soft" ones who don't
realize what's going on

403
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,875
should just leave now...

404
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:52,291
That is the school's policy
on the matter, anyway.

405
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,250
But you know what...?

406
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,500
As a teacher, I'm not
a big fan of this policy.

407
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:02,458
You're not a big fan...?
What does that mean?

408
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,666
Bit contradictory,
isn't it...?

409
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,583
Now, Onmyo Prep
knew how I felt...

410
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:07,875
But they decided to go ahead and

411
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,958
bring me in as your
homeroom teacher anyway...

412
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,250
Why do you figure they
might've done such a thing?

413
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,458
Wanna know my opinion?

414
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,083
[OHTOMO] In short...

415
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,875
the real world
can be complicated.

416
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,625
[OHTOMO] It's rough.

417
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,708
The world of adults very rarely
makes sense, and I'm sorry...

418
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,916
What are your thoughts on
the subject... Harutora?

419
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,625
Uh... I...
I dunno...

420
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,708
The truth is I have a hard
time following the lectures.

421
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,291
And honestly,
it'd help me a lot

422
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,583
if you took that
into consideration.

423
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,083
[KYOKO] So basically
you have no problem

424
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,500
causing trouble
for the rest of us?

425
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,541
[HARUTORA] No.
I never said that.

426
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,416
I feel really bad about it...

427
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,958
But just like you guys...

428
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,791
I'm a student at this school.

429
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,125
I have the right to be
here and to learn...

430
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,750
like anyone else.

431
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,291
I've sworn to become
an onmyo mage.

432
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:02,416
That's my first
priority, not you.

433
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,583
[OHTOMO chuckles]

434
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,666
Do you not get
this is a place

435
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,375
for those at the top
of their class?!

436
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,333
You have no talent, so why
the heck are you even here?

437
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,375
[KON] That's enough,
you scoundrel!

438
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,541
Aaahh!

439
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,750
How dare you be so rude?!

440
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,083
Just because my master is
dumber than everyone else,

441
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,375
doesn't mean you can sp--

442
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,958
You're the one being
rude right now, Kon!

443
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,166
How can you embarrass me in
front of all these people?!

444
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,916
And what do you mean I'm
dumber than everyone else?

445
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,791
You're making fun of me?!
How is that supportive?

446
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,208
You're supposed to be
my defense familiar--

447
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,833
[KYOKO]
Hakuou! Kokufuu!

448
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:46,333
[KYOKO] I can't believe you can
use defense familiars, too.

449
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:49,666
And why you couldn't be
upfront about it anyway?!

450
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,166
I'm really confused.

451
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,625
This girl keeps getting
ruder and ruder!

452
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:55,833
I'll no longer hold back!

453
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,458
[clapping]

454
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,250
Nice to see you're both
motivated and enthusiastic...

455
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,333
Gives me an idea...

456
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,916
Why not have a battle
of the familiars?

457
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,958
[HARUTORA] Ugh...
Of course he'd say that.

458
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,750
You know I've never done
anything like this before,

459
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:14,583
don't you?

460
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,083
Oh, I'm sure
you'll be fine.

461
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:20,375
And, novice or not,
you shouldn't belittle yourself.

462
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,708
To be honest,
I have doubted you...

463
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,000
But what you said before...

464
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,125
Well, it was reassuring...

465
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,708
I thought, "Even with
all that's happened,

466
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,791
he still wants to
be an onmyo mage."

467
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,500
All you need to do
is simply improve

468
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,875
your natural abilities
your own way.

469
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,333
[OHTOMO chuckles]

470
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,666
[HARUTORA]
Mister Ohtomo...?

471
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,791
What's up?

472
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,125
I have a favor
I'd like to ask you.

473
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,875
Um...
Master Harutora?

474
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,958
Now, I've gone ahead
and cast those spells

475
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,625
on the armor and
the wooden sword.

476
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:58,750
Oh... thank you sir,
I really appreciate it.

477
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,125
What's with that costume?

478
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,708
The familiars are
the ones fighting.

479
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,250
Why do you insist
on looking silly?

480
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,333
Insolent
little wretch!

481
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:06,541
[HARUTORA] Kon...

482
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,416
you can take care of
the light one, right...?

483
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,458
Just leave the dark
familiar to me.

484
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:11,666
Leave it to you?

485
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,208
Ah! I can't do that,
Master Harutora!

486
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,416
Stop messing around!

487
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,583
This is a battle of familiars...

488
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,583
you can only fight
with familiars!

489
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:21,166
[HARUTORA]
That's what I'm doing.

490
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,583
I'm a familiar too. Heh.

491
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,958
All right then...

492
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,958
Is everyone ready?

493
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:33,208
[OHTOMO] Begin!

494
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,458
I finally appeared
in the anime!

495
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:08,041
Yahaa!

496
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:09,541
Even better,
I'm here!

497
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:10,958
Me, too!
Yay!
