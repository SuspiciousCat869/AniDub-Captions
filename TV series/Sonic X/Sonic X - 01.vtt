very often.

00:14:18.018 --> 00:14:20.286
In fact, I'm glad you showed up.

00:14:20.387 --> 00:14:23.089
This place is way too peaceful.

00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:26.593
Over the last 12 months,
I've only made one arrest.

00:14:26.726 --> 00:14:30.263
Some joker got it into his head
that he was a hotshot driver.

00:14:30.397 --> 00:14:33.099
Had his own Formula 1 car
and everything.

00:14:33.199 --> 00:14:36.669
I guess he thought he'd give me
a run for my money.

00:14:36.803 --> 00:14:38.772
But it was all over in a minute.

00:14:38.872 --> 00:14:41.508
It took me longer
than that to suit up.

00:14:42.342 --> 00:14:43.443
Hmm.

00:14:43.543 --> 00:14:46.446
[Chuckles]
He never had a chance.

00:14:46.546 --> 00:14:48.415
Of course, it's our own fault.

00:14:48.515 --> 00:14:51.051
This town's dull
mainly because of us.

00:14:51.151 --> 00:14:54.421
You see, we're the high-speed
pursuit unit, the S-Team.

00:14:54.521 --> 00:14:57.057
And I'm the leader of the team.

00:14:57.157 --> 00:14:59.392
They call me the Highway Star.

00:14:59.526 --> 00:15:03.563
So even if you think you're
the fastest thing around,

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:04.931
think again.

00:15:05.031 --> 00:15:07.867
[Engines turn over,
tires screeching]

00:15:14.841 --> 00:15:17.077
[Thinking]
Run fast, hedgehog.

00:15:17.177 --> 00:15:20.046
I wanna be the one to catch you.

00:15:29.484 --> 00:15:31.285
Ha!
The S-Team, eh?

00:15:31.385 --> 00:15:34.589
The "S" must stand
for slow motion. [Laughs]

00:15:35.656 --> 00:15:36.691
It's accelerating.

00:15:36.824 --> 00:15:39.727
Boost your rear-wing angle
to 20 degrees.

00:15:39.827 --> 00:15:41.629
Roger.

00:15:53.374 --> 00:15:54.442
Well, well, well.

00:15:54.542 --> 00:15:56.844
It's starting to look
like the rush hour.

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:02.550
[Sarcastically] Oh, no!
How will I ever escape?

00:16:02.683 --> 00:16:03.851
[Laughs]

00:16:04.385 --> 00:16:07.488
Where is he?
Did I run him over?

00:16:07.622 --> 00:16:08.723
Huh?

00:16:08.856 --> 00:16:09.991
Huh?!

00:16:10.091 --> 00:16:12.059
Hey, you!
This is dangerous!

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.427
It's irresponsible!

00:16:13.528 --> 00:16:16.030
What happens if kids
start trying this?

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:20.001
Kids, don't use Formula 1
race cars to chase hedgehogs.

00:16:21.035 --> 00:16:23.738
You're not gonna treat
the S-Team like chumps.

00:16:23.838 --> 00:16:25.573
We'll teach you a lesson.

00:16:25.673 --> 00:16:29.577
Boost all wings.5 degrees,
and let's get this guy!

00:16:29.677 --> 00:16:31.012
Roger.

00:16:46.661 --> 00:16:48.996
Full throttle!

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.042
What the...
How can...

00:17:01.142 --> 00:17:02.944
It's playing with us!

00:17:03.044 --> 00:17:05.046
Where'd this thing come from?

00:17:05.146 --> 00:17:07.381
Chief, you got to do something!

00:17:07.481 --> 00:17:09.884
Playtime is now officially over.

00:17:09.984 --> 00:17:11.552
Attention, all units.

00:17:11.686 --> 00:17:13.221
Open the center line.

00:17:13.354 --> 00:17:14.889
[Tires screeching]

00:17:15.022 --> 00:17:16.924
I didn't think
I'd have to do this,

00:17:17.024 --> 00:17:18.793
but I have no choice.

00:17:18.893 --> 00:17:23.798
I will not have anybody
faster than me on my highway.

00:17:41.882 --> 00:17:45.186
[Laughs] The only way
he can beat me now

00:17:45.286 --> 00:17:47.521
is if he goes supersonic.

00:17:47.655 --> 00:17:49.123
[Laughs]

00:17:54.195 --> 00:17:55.529
A sonic boom!

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:58.032
He's moving faster
than the speed of sound.

00:17:58.132 --> 00:18:00.901
Chief, you're running out
of road!

00:18:04.705 --> 00:18:06.407
Oh.

00:18:21.922 --> 00:18:24.558
Maybe this place isn't so bad.

00:18:24.659 --> 00:18:27.662
At least I know somebody
I can have fun with.

00:18:35.369 --> 00:18:36.504
Oh!

00:18:37.872 --> 00:18:39.907
A pool?!

00:18:40.007 --> 00:18:41.175
[Chuckles]

00:18:41.275 --> 00:18:43.010
Uh-oh.

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:46.047
[Grunting]

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.248
See ya!

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.741
[Muffled] Huh?

00:19:47.108 --> 00:19:48.476
[Grunting]

00:20:18.005 --> 00:20:19.640
[Coughing]

00:20:21.041 --> 00:20:24.678
That was close.
Are you okay?

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.616
[Grunts] Yeah.
Thanks a lot.

00:20:28.716 --> 00:20:30.885
I didn't think you could talk.

00:20:31.886 --> 00:20:34.188
I can do a lot of things.

00:20:34.288 --> 00:20:36.390
Wow!
That's awesome.

00:20:36.524 --> 00:20:38.325
That you can talk, I mean.

00:20:38.426 --> 00:20:40.394
My name's Christopher.

00:20:40.528 --> 00:20:42.596
Do you have a name?

00:20:42.696 --> 00:20:45.199
Yeah, I have a name.

00:20:46.834 --> 00:20:50.037
My name is Sonic the Hedgehog.
