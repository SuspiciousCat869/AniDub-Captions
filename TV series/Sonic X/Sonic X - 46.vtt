00:00:00.434 --> 00:00:01.969
Last time on Sonic X,

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:04.137
as part of a plan to
capture Dr. Eggman,

00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:06.240
the President created
a combat contest

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.909
with a gem of a prizeâa
Chaos Emerald.

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:10.110
As the battling began,

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.513
the Commander-in-Chief got
clobbered by a knight,

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:14.214
and the other competitors
duked it out

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:15.883
in a series of kooky clashes.

00:00:15.883 --> 00:00:17.584
The odds-on-favorite was Sonic

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:19.887
'til he found out he had
to face off against Amy!

00:00:19.887 --> 00:00:22.155
But the uncomfortable
confrontation was avoided when

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.857
Eggman butted into the battle.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:26.093
Now it's down to the
final eight fighters.

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:27.594
Who will prevail and
pick up the Emerald?

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:30.063
Find out next on Sonic X!

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.765
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:34.835
Gotta go fast

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.771
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:43.610
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.679
Got ourselves a situation

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.714
Stuck in a new location

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:51.318
Without any explanation

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.387
No talk of relaxation

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.022
Don't, don't, don't

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:56.823
Don't blink, don't think

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:58.625
Just go, go, go, go

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.127
Go, go

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:05.666
Sonic is on the run

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.534
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:11.271
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:14.975
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:17.377
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:19.279
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:21.782
Sonic X

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:23.717
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.520
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.554
Sonic X

00:01:33.352 --> 00:01:35.287
Keep away from me!

00:01:36.088 --> 00:01:36.922
[Gasp]

00:01:40.526 --> 00:01:42.561
[Yelling]

00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:43.929
[Grunt]

00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:46.365
[Grunt]

00:01:46.365 --> 00:01:48.367
Please, Chris, I don't
want to fight you.

00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:50.603
I don't understand, Tails.

00:01:50.603 --> 00:01:52.238
Why is Knuckles running away?

00:01:52.238 --> 00:01:54.173
Knuckles probably
doesn't want to fight

00:01:54.173 --> 00:01:56.375
'cause he's afraid that
Chris is gonna get hurt.

00:01:57.343 --> 00:01:58.878
CHRIS: Let's go, Knuckles!

00:01:58.878 --> 00:01:59.578
No!

00:01:59.578 --> 00:02:01.247
Why won't Knuckles fight?

00:02:01.247 --> 00:02:02.781
Quit running away!

00:02:02.781 --> 00:02:03.749
I won't! Cut it out!

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:05.017
Come on and fight me!

00:02:05.017 --> 00:02:06.252
I'm not gonna fight you!

00:02:06.252 --> 00:02:07.453
Hey!

00:02:07.453 --> 00:02:08.787
[Yelling]

00:02:08.787 --> 00:02:11.156
CHRIS: [Grunts]
SCARLET: That Chris Thorndyke certainly is brave.

00:02:11.156 --> 00:02:13.759
TAILS: Especially when the
other guy's running away.

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:15.761
Why don't you just
forfeit so I can win?

00:02:15.761 --> 00:02:19.231
Okay, but look who's
in the next round.

00:02:19.231 --> 00:02:20.199
Hmm?

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:21.166
Oh.

00:02:21.734 --> 00:02:24.637
I'd have to fight Amy or Rouge?

00:02:24.637 --> 00:02:25.738
Uh...!

00:02:25.738 --> 00:02:28.641
Rouge will do anything to
win that Chaos Emerald.

00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:29.942
And if Amy gets mad enough,

00:02:29.942 --> 00:02:31.543
she'll knock me out of the stadium.

00:02:31.543 --> 00:02:33.479
There's no way to win.

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:34.747
[Gulp]

00:02:35.547 --> 00:02:36.949
[Groans]

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:39.785
My appendix! Get me a doctor!

00:02:39.785 --> 00:02:41.720
Knuckles moves on.

00:02:42.655 --> 00:02:45.190
I think you made a
very wise move, Chris.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.791
Yeah.

00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:48.093
I see you have your
mom's acting talent.

00:02:48.093 --> 00:02:50.129
[Laughing]

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.272
Mr. Stewart, how would
you rate your opponent?

00:03:00.272 --> 00:03:03.008
[gasp] Franklin? What
are you doing here?

00:03:03.008 --> 00:03:05.477
I just look like me!

00:03:05.477 --> 00:03:08.547
Ah! My cover's been blown!

00:03:15.287 --> 00:03:16.989
Brace yourself, my little friend.

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.491
I am going to stick it to you!

00:03:19.825 --> 00:03:22.061
[Yelling]

00:03:22.795 --> 00:03:25.030
[beeping]

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.966
Hya!

00:03:26.966 --> 00:03:30.269
[Beeping]

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.070
Ha!

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.341
Oh, no.

00:03:35.908 --> 00:03:36.775
Ah!

00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:40.879
I think I'm on the wrong
end of that stick.

00:03:42.915 --> 00:03:44.850
Ohhhh...!

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.285
I give up.

00:03:46.285 --> 00:03:47.252
[Applause]

00:03:47.252 --> 00:03:48.554
Yay, Emerl!

00:03:48.554 --> 00:03:49.788
Chao chao!

00:03:54.326 --> 00:03:55.761
[Bell rings]

00:03:55.761 --> 00:03:57.262
Let's go!

00:03:57.262 --> 00:03:59.198
This oughta be interesting.

00:03:59.765 --> 00:04:02.301
[Grunting]

00:04:03.502 --> 00:04:04.470
[Both grunting]

00:04:05.104 --> 00:04:08.607
I'd really be going to the hospital
if I'd messed with one of them.

00:04:12.945 --> 00:04:14.279
Aaah!

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.251
[Panting]

00:04:19.785 --> 00:04:22.988
This just proves a hammer's
no match for a bat.

00:04:22.988 --> 00:04:24.757
[Frustrated yell]

00:04:24.757 --> 00:04:26.692
SCARLET: We're down
to the final four now.

00:04:26.692 --> 00:04:30.195
Emerl versus Lucky, and
Knuckles against Rouge.

00:04:30.195 --> 00:04:35.667
[Both panting]

00:04:35.667 --> 00:04:37.336
I need a break!

00:04:37.336 --> 00:04:38.437
Do not stop!

00:04:38.437 --> 00:04:39.671
They are gaining on us!

00:04:39.671 --> 00:04:42.708
[Panicked moans]

00:04:42.708 --> 00:04:44.643
You won't get away!

00:04:44.943 --> 00:04:46.545
If you want to keep up with me,

00:04:46.545 --> 00:04:48.714
you'd better take flying lessons!

00:04:48.714 --> 00:04:51.917
SCARLET: The semifinals begin with
the showdown between robotic rivals.

00:04:51.917 --> 00:05:02.828
[Arrogant beeping]

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:08.200
It looks like Lucky's grandstanding
has used up his power supply.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.835
Emerl is the winner!

00:05:09.835 --> 00:05:11.904
[Crowd cheers]

00:05:11.904 --> 00:05:14.807
That means Emerl's made
it to the final round!

00:05:14.807 --> 00:05:15.441
Yay!

00:05:15.441 --> 00:05:16.442
Chao!

00:05:17.843 --> 00:05:18.844
[Bell rings]

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.022
Knuckles is a heavy hitter,

00:05:30.022 --> 00:05:31.557
but when it comes to brainpower,

00:05:31.557 --> 00:05:33.092
he's a real lightweight.

00:05:33.092 --> 00:05:35.527
I'll have to figure out
some way to outsmart him.

00:05:35.527 --> 00:05:39.364
That's the only way of getting my
hands on that gorgeous Emerald.

00:05:39.932 --> 00:05:41.633
I've got it!

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:42.835
Hey, Knuckles,

00:05:42.835 --> 00:05:46.605
maybe you and I oughta settle
this little thing in private.

00:05:47.573 --> 00:05:48.874
In private?

00:05:48.874 --> 00:05:51.610
Mm. Just you and me.

00:05:52.044 --> 00:05:54.546
Hey! We paid to see some action!

00:05:54.546 --> 00:05:57.249
[Crowd commotion]

00:06:01.487 --> 00:06:03.589
I can't see a thing in here.

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:06.158
Rouge, how am I supposed to fight?

00:06:06.158 --> 00:06:07.693
Like this!

00:06:07.693 --> 00:06:11.096
[Sounds of fighting]

00:06:11.096 --> 00:06:12.131
Haha!

00:06:12.131 --> 00:06:15.033
We don't have any way of knowing
who's winning the match right now,

00:06:15.033 --> 00:06:17.936
but it sounds like Knuckles
and Rouge are in a slugfest.

00:06:17.936 --> 00:06:19.638
Who do you think is winning, Tails?

00:06:19.638 --> 00:06:22.774
Bats have sonar ability to
sense things in the dark,

00:06:22.774 --> 00:06:24.643
so I'm pretty sure that
Rouge has the edge here.

00:06:24.643 --> 00:06:26.578
[Both grunting]

00:06:26.578 --> 00:06:30.449
[Sounds of fighting]
ROUGE: Ha ha! Sweet dreams, Knuckles!

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:33.118
[Crowd commotion]

00:06:37.623 --> 00:06:38.390
[Crowd cheers]

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.461
Things get intense in tents,
but I'm still standing!

00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:45.564
SCARLET: Rouge the Bat is
on her way to the finals!

00:06:45.564 --> 00:06:47.166
ROUGE: [Groaning] Ugh!

00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:50.169
TAILS: [Gasp] Hey, wait!

00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:57.676
I guess I stood up to her.

00:06:57.676 --> 00:06:59.945
Knuckles is moving on
to the final round!

00:06:59.945 --> 00:07:03.949
[Crowd cheers]

00:07:07.352 --> 00:07:08.453
Go away!

00:07:08.453 --> 00:07:10.589
You're like a wad of
bubble gum I've sat on,

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:12.758
and no matter how hard
I try to shake you off,

00:07:12.758 --> 00:07:14.426
you stick to my tail!

00:07:14.426 --> 00:07:16.662
I'm not gonna let you get away!

00:07:16.662 --> 00:07:18.597
I don't know what
new plan is brewing

00:07:18.597 --> 00:07:20.065
in that messed-up mind of yours,

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:21.934
but I won't rest till I stop ya!

00:07:21.934 --> 00:07:25.370
Well, my latest and greatest
scheme is so brilliantly planned

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:26.838
in every detail, that not even

00:07:26.838 --> 00:07:28.907
a loose cannon like you
can blast it apart!

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:31.910
Sure, that's what
you always say, Doc.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.845
You think you're funny, don't you?

00:07:33.845 --> 00:07:36.181
Well, this time, I'm gonna
crack <i>you</i> up,

00:07:36.181 --> 00:07:37.749
once and for all!

00:07:39.585 --> 00:07:41.520
Okay, Eggman, it's game time!

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.487
[grunt]

00:07:43.956 --> 00:07:46.959
[Yelling]

00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:47.826
Oof!

00:07:47.826 --> 00:07:50.429
Well! Looks like I
hit a grand slam.

00:07:50.429 --> 00:07:53.432
[Still screaming]

00:07:53.432 --> 00:07:54.933
ANNOUNCER: And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:56.802
it's time for the final match.

00:07:56.802 --> 00:07:59.037
The winner will take
home a Chaos Emerald.

00:07:59.037 --> 00:08:02.574
In this corner, we have the world's
toughest fistfighterâKnuckles!

00:08:02.574 --> 00:08:06.578
And in this corner, we have the master
of computerized combatâEmerl!

00:08:06.578 --> 00:08:08.847
Go show everybody you're
number one, Emerl!

00:08:08.847 --> 00:08:09.815
Chao chao!

00:08:09.815 --> 00:08:11.283
With fighters this closely matched,

00:08:11.283 --> 00:08:14.353
I'd say we're in for the most
grueling bout of the tournament.

00:08:14.353 --> 00:08:16.355
Aaaahh!

00:08:16.355 --> 00:08:17.322
[Grunt]

00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:21.760
Ha!

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.565
[Grunt] Ha! Ungh!

00:08:26.565 --> 00:08:27.532
[Chuckling]

00:08:27.766 --> 00:08:29.701
Come on, Emerl!

00:08:30.068 --> 00:08:33.472
[Yelling]

00:08:33.472 --> 00:08:35.440
Hey, knock it off! [Grunt]

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.776
Emerl copied that from Sonic!

00:08:37.776 --> 00:08:39.745
Aaaaahhhh!

00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:42.314
[Yelling]

00:08:44.249 --> 00:08:45.317
[Yelling continues]

00:08:45.317 --> 00:08:46.285
[Thud]

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.187
Oof.

00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:53.492
[Grunting]

00:08:53.492 --> 00:08:55.427
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:08:55.427 --> 00:08:56.595
[Grunting]

00:08:56.795 --> 00:08:59.364
Knuckles is totally
outmatched, Grandpa.

00:08:59.798 --> 00:09:03.535
Looks like Knucklehead won't be
winning the Chaos Emerald either.

00:09:03.535 --> 00:09:05.037
Aah!

00:09:05.937 --> 00:09:07.939
Poor Knuckles is hurt!

00:09:07.939 --> 00:09:09.841
He could use a hankie!

00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:10.642
Chao!

00:09:10.642 --> 00:09:12.010
Here!

00:09:12.878 --> 00:09:15.180
That's it! Knuckles gives up!

00:09:15.547 --> 00:09:16.281
[Bell clanging]

00:09:16.281 --> 00:09:18.450
Our winner is Emerl!

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:19.951
[Groaning]

00:09:19.951 --> 00:09:21.053
[Frustrated growl]

00:09:21.053 --> 00:09:24.556
No! He thought my hankie
was a white flag!

00:09:24.556 --> 00:09:26.958
Please wait, sir!
There's been a mistake!

00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.493
I was trying to help Knuckles!

00:09:28.493 --> 00:09:31.096
He didn't quit the match, honest!

00:09:31.096 --> 00:09:32.631
But I did quit.

00:09:32.631 --> 00:09:33.398
Huh?

00:09:33.398 --> 00:09:36.168
Chao! Chao chao chao chao chao!

00:09:36.168 --> 00:09:37.469
I feel a lot better now

00:09:37.469 --> 00:09:39.638
that I know you didn't lose
the match because of me.

00:09:41.173 --> 00:09:42.541
Hmph.

00:09:44.476 --> 00:09:46.078
Not bad, Emerl.

00:09:46.078 --> 00:09:49.648
We'll have to have another match
when I'm not feeling so beat.

00:09:49.648 --> 00:09:53.719
I deserve some credit since I'm
the one who wore Knuckles out.

00:09:54.686 --> 00:09:57.775
[Crowd cheering]

00:10:06.235 --> 00:10:09.738
Now it's time to present the
grand prize to our champion.

00:10:11.674 --> 00:10:12.641
That's you, Emerl!

00:10:12.641 --> 00:10:14.576
Go up and get your Chaos Emerald!

00:10:14.576 --> 00:10:17.746
Then everybody will cheer for
you, and you can take a bow.

00:10:17.746 --> 00:10:19.682
Let's hear it for Emerl!

00:10:19.682 --> 00:10:24.420
[Crowd cheering]

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.122
Congratulations, Emerl.
That was great!

00:10:27.122 --> 00:10:28.757
[Beeping]

00:10:28.757 --> 00:10:30.025
Bring the award.

00:10:33.796 --> 00:10:36.498
The Chaos Emerald that the president
is presenting to our winner

00:10:36.498 --> 00:10:39.768
is the most valuable prize ever
awarded in a sporting competition.

00:10:39.768 --> 00:10:43.639
Emerl, as we build a fighting
force to combat Dr. Eggman,

00:10:43.639 --> 00:10:47.743
your victory is an inspiration
to all our fighting robots.

00:10:47.743 --> 00:10:48.777
[Beeping]

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.215
I could've snatched
that Chaos Emerald

00:10:53.215 --> 00:10:55.150
if it wasn't for
you two lead heads.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:56.151
Why is it our fault?

00:10:56.151 --> 00:10:58.821
Why do we always end up
losing the blame game?

00:10:58.821 --> 00:10:59.755
Hmm.

00:10:59.755 --> 00:11:01.323
Speaking of games...

00:11:02.057 --> 00:11:04.626
[All yell]

00:11:04.626 --> 00:11:08.430
On behalf of the whole nation,
I congratulate Emerl.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:12.067
[Crowd cheering]

00:11:20.109 --> 00:11:22.544
[Electricity crackles]

00:11:32.821 --> 00:11:34.757
[All gasp]

00:11:34.757 --> 00:11:36.825
[Explosion]

00:11:36.825 --> 00:11:38.827
[Crowd screams]

00:11:38.827 --> 00:11:42.498
[Explosions]

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.773
Emerl, is there something
that made you angry?

00:11:50.773 --> 00:11:53.108
Why are you attacking everybody?

00:11:58.247 --> 00:12:00.516
[Grunting]

00:12:00.716 --> 00:12:06.054
[Beeping]

00:12:07.022 --> 00:12:07.656
Oof!

00:12:11.527 --> 00:12:12.728
Ah!

00:12:16.598 --> 00:12:18.267
Aah!

00:12:19.334 --> 00:12:21.770
Stop, before it's too late!

00:12:22.805 --> 00:12:23.772
[Gasping]

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.542
I'll save you!

00:12:26.542 --> 00:12:27.509
[Screaming]

00:12:32.848 --> 00:12:36.251
Emerl, that's it! I
can't be your friend!

00:12:36.852 --> 00:12:39.755
I'll knock Emerl out so we
can open up his control panel

00:12:39.755 --> 00:12:42.357
and check out why
he's malfunctioning!

00:12:43.892 --> 00:12:47.362
Aaaaahhh!

00:12:48.263 --> 00:12:52.901
[Sounds of fighting]

00:12:52.901 --> 00:12:53.969
Aah!

00:12:53.969 --> 00:12:56.872
Sonic, come help me!

00:12:57.239 --> 00:12:58.473
Oof!

00:12:58.473 --> 00:12:59.474
[Grunting]

00:12:59.474 --> 00:13:01.410
Emerl, this isn't a game!

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:02.845
You've got to stop right now,

00:13:02.845 --> 00:13:04.613
or somebody is going to get hurt!

00:13:08.584 --> 00:13:09.585
Aah!

00:13:09.585 --> 00:13:11.620
Cream, look out!

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:12.154
Aah!

00:13:12.154 --> 00:13:14.056
Are you okay, Cream?

00:13:14.056 --> 00:13:15.090
I am.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:16.992
[Crowd yelling]

00:13:26.001 --> 00:13:27.302
He's gaining on us!

00:13:27.302 --> 00:13:28.370
Look out!

00:13:35.711 --> 00:13:37.880
Why is he acting this way?

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.815
My guess is that the Chaos Emerald

00:13:39.815 --> 00:13:43.218
suddenly caused Emerl's memory
unit to re-program itself.

00:13:43.218 --> 00:13:46.622
But I don't have any idea
how, or why, it happened.

00:13:46.622 --> 00:13:48.190
Can't we just fix Emerl and

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:50.192
change him back to the
way he was before?

00:13:50.192 --> 00:13:51.660
That would be very tough.

00:13:54.663 --> 00:13:55.631
Wow!

00:13:55.631 --> 00:13:58.533
It looks like Emerl was a big
hit in this neighborhood.

00:13:58.533 --> 00:14:00.435
He is a real blockbuster.

00:14:00.435 --> 00:14:02.638
Emerl was designed to destroy.

00:14:02.638 --> 00:14:05.274
He was built a long time
ago as a combat robot.

00:14:05.274 --> 00:14:06.875
And when he got that Chaos Emerald,

00:14:06.875 --> 00:14:09.745
its tremendous energy activated
his original programming and

00:14:09.745 --> 00:14:13.015
changed him from a nice, docile
robot into a mean machine.

00:14:13.015 --> 00:14:14.650
[Evil laughter]

00:14:25.694 --> 00:14:26.662
Hmm.

00:14:26.662 --> 00:14:28.597
I'm ready to fight you again.

00:14:28.964 --> 00:14:31.767
Only this time, I'm
adding a little twist!

00:14:37.873 --> 00:14:38.740
Huh!

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:39.541
[Grunt]

00:14:41.843 --> 00:14:45.113
CHUCK: Emerl's copying ability
gives him a huge advantage.

00:14:45.113 --> 00:14:47.549
Knuckles' fighting
skills don't matter.

00:14:47.549 --> 00:14:49.651
Emerl can match him blow for blow.

00:14:49.651 --> 00:14:52.154
When Knuckles attacks
with all his might,

00:14:52.154 --> 00:14:54.323
he gets attacked
with the same force.

00:14:54.323 --> 00:14:56.558
It's almost like he's
fighting against himself.

00:14:57.592 --> 00:14:59.127
He can't win.

00:15:00.095 --> 00:15:03.165
Give it up and give
us a shot, Knuckles.

00:15:03.165 --> 00:15:05.233
I still have a chance.

00:15:05.233 --> 00:15:07.970
Yeah, a chance of windin'
up in the hospital.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:09.671
Let us handle this.

00:15:09.671 --> 00:15:11.173
I am not a quitter!

00:15:11.173 --> 00:15:13.108
I'll stop that robot!

00:15:13.108 --> 00:15:14.543
[Both growling]

00:15:16.678 --> 00:15:17.512
[Gasp]

00:15:17.512 --> 00:15:18.180
Amy!

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.681
You saved me again, Sonic!

00:15:19.681 --> 00:15:21.149
Oof!

00:15:21.149 --> 00:15:23.185
Not that I needed saving!

00:15:30.726 --> 00:15:31.693
[Grunting]

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.229
That robot must have some weakness.

00:15:34.229 --> 00:15:35.731
I'm gonna take Emerl apart!

00:15:35.731 --> 00:15:37.966
Let me have a crack
at him first, Tails!

00:15:37.966 --> 00:15:40.602
[Groaning]

00:15:40.602 --> 00:15:41.970
Sorry.

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:43.438
That's okay.

00:15:50.178 --> 00:15:51.146
[Grunting]

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.647
Oof!

00:15:55.217 --> 00:15:56.418
[Grunt]

00:15:56.418 --> 00:15:58.253
Well, now what?

00:15:58.253 --> 00:16:00.889
Maybe if all three of
us fight it at once.

00:16:00.889 --> 00:16:02.457
It's our only chance.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:06.795
I'll cut him off!

00:16:06.795 --> 00:16:07.829
Then we strike!

00:16:07.829 --> 00:16:08.697
Right!

00:16:08.697 --> 00:16:10.098
I'm scared, Mama.

00:16:10.098 --> 00:16:11.199
Chao!

00:16:11.199 --> 00:16:13.468
I hope they know what
they're doing, Chuck.

00:16:13.468 --> 00:16:15.670
I don't trust that Emerl.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.939
That robot's extremely clever.

00:16:17.939 --> 00:16:20.308
Where do you think Emerl's
running to, Grandpa?

00:16:20.308 --> 00:16:21.676
Hey, I bet I know!

00:16:21.676 --> 00:16:24.579
He's leading Sonic
straight to the sea!

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:30.452
[All panting]

00:16:30.452 --> 00:16:31.720
Aah!

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.754
[Panting]

00:16:32.754 --> 00:16:34.990
Sorry, boys, I can't
keep up with ya.

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:36.224
Uh-oh!

00:16:39.127 --> 00:16:44.966
[All panting]

00:16:44.966 --> 00:16:46.735
I bet Emerl led them to the sea

00:16:46.735 --> 00:16:48.437
'cause he knows Sonic
doesn't like water!

00:16:48.437 --> 00:16:51.540
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:52.941
Woah! [Grunts]

00:16:52.941 --> 00:16:54.443
Sonic, be careful!

00:16:54.443 --> 00:16:55.844
Let's go, Cheese!

00:16:55.844 --> 00:16:56.945
Chao chao!

00:16:56.945 --> 00:16:57.913
Wo-woah!

00:16:59.448 --> 00:17:00.182
[grunt]

00:17:00.182 --> 00:17:01.149
Thanks, Cream.

00:17:01.149 --> 00:17:03.685
I know how much you
hate to get wet.

Knuckles!

00:17:10.225 --> 00:17:11.760
Emerl!

00:17:15.197 --> 00:17:16.698
You just wrecked the city!

00:17:17.999 --> 00:17:20.602
And you attacked my
mother and my friends!

00:17:21.703 --> 00:17:23.638
I want to help you, Emerl,

00:17:23.638 --> 00:17:27.008
but only if you promise
not to hurt anybody else.

00:17:27.008 --> 00:17:28.210
Do you?

00:17:29.544 --> 00:17:31.213
Chao! chao!

No!

[Screaming]

00:17:40.622 --> 00:17:41.857
Huh?

00:17:47.462 --> 00:17:49.798
That was a real close one.

00:17:49.798 --> 00:17:50.999
Oof.

00:17:50.999 --> 00:17:53.635
He's almost as tough as me.

00:17:53.635 --> 00:17:55.937
[Groaning]

00:18:03.085 --> 00:18:06.054
[Whimpering]

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:11.093
Chaooo!

00:18:11.093 --> 00:18:12.027
Hyaa!

00:18:12.127 --> 00:18:13.161
Whoa!

00:18:14.596 --> 00:18:17.699
Chaooooooo!

00:18:21.136 --> 00:18:23.371
Whoa! They're tough!

00:18:23.972 --> 00:18:25.941
But how could they hurt Emerl?

00:18:25.941 --> 00:18:27.676
They're just a couple of squirts,

00:18:27.676 --> 00:18:29.344
but they've got that robot swamped.

00:18:29.344 --> 00:18:30.645
Hyaa!

00:18:33.348 --> 00:18:35.283
Chao!

00:18:36.351 --> 00:18:37.786
Haa!

00:18:37.786 --> 00:18:39.187
Chao!

00:18:42.057 --> 00:18:45.393
Emerl can only copy the skills
of one opponent at a time!

00:18:45.393 --> 00:18:48.296
If you work together,
he'll be overwhelmed!

00:18:48.296 --> 00:18:49.731
That might work!

00:18:49.731 --> 00:18:50.699
Whaddaya say?

00:18:50.699 --> 00:18:53.535
I'll try anything to
knock off that knock-off.

00:18:53.535 --> 00:18:54.903
SONIC: No.

00:18:54.903 --> 00:18:55.971
Why not?

00:18:55.971 --> 00:18:58.773
Rouge and I can take him easy
if we attack him together.

00:18:58.773 --> 00:19:00.408
Yeah, I know.

00:19:00.408 --> 00:19:03.678
But I think we should let
Cream and Cheese handle this.

00:19:04.112 --> 00:19:06.047
Now, let's go!

00:19:07.082 --> 00:19:08.550
Chao chao!

00:19:13.889 --> 00:19:17.893
Emerl, I wish I didn't
have to do this.

00:19:19.794 --> 00:19:21.763
[Gasp]

00:19:27.903 --> 00:19:29.471
Bye, Chris!

00:19:29.471 --> 00:19:30.972
[Laughter]

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.176
[Laughter]

00:19:34.176 --> 00:19:36.912
Aaah!

00:19:44.986 --> 00:19:46.454
[Beeping]

00:19:46.454 --> 00:19:49.824
[Crying]

00:20:04.606 --> 00:20:06.208
Chao chao chao!

00:20:07.175 --> 00:20:09.444
Chao, chao, chao, chao!

00:20:09.911 --> 00:20:11.379
Chao chao chao!

00:20:11.379 --> 00:20:14.616
Don't cry, Cheese. We had to do it.

00:20:14.616 --> 00:20:16.218
Chao chao chao!

00:20:22.557 --> 00:20:23.525
Aah!

00:20:24.326 --> 00:20:26.394
[Crying]

00:20:26.394 --> 00:20:28.363
Goodbye, Emerl.
