[Beeping]

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:14.548
More Metarex!

00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:15.615
Chao chao!

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:17.517
Somebody's in trouble.

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:19.152
We're getting a signal.

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:22.022
There's a Chaos Emerald
somewhere aboard that craft.

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.557
They're in great danger.

00:00:23.557 --> 00:00:25.091
If what Chris says is true,

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:26.960
then those Metarex
will stop at nothing

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.161
to get what they want.

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.930
We must help them.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.331
She's right.

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:32.432
Whaddaya say, Chris?

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:33.667
Okay!

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:36.469
As captain, I hereby
veto that plan.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.171
We have our safety to think about.

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:39.139
Later kids!

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:41.074
Looks like you're too late, Tails.

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:42.375
Chao!

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:43.577
[Sigh]

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:46.379
Why do they even bother
having a captain anyway.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.823
We'll be on that mystery
ship in no time.

00:00:57.791 --> 00:00:59.726
Hope they're okay up there.

00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:07.400
Man, they really got
that thing surrounded.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.269
Yeah, you're right.

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:10.537
Looks pretty bad.

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:16.610
Phew!

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:18.111
[Grunt]

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:29.856
Missile launch!

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:38.898
Good shot!

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:46.406
Go, go, go, go, go

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:49.509
Gotta go fast

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:52.445
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:58.251
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:00.320
Got ourselves a situation

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.355
Stuck in a new location

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:05.959
Without any explanation

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.028
No talk of relaxation

00:02:08.028 --> 00:02:09.663
Don't, don't, don't

00:02:09.663 --> 00:02:11.464
Don't blink, don't think

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:13.266
Just go, go, go, go

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:14.734
Go, go

00:02:18.405 --> 00:02:20.306
Sonic is on the run

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:22.208
Sonic, he's number one

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:25.912
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

Gotta go faster, faster,

Sonic X

00:02:57.428 --> 00:02:58.295
Hiya, Tails.

00:02:58.295 --> 00:02:58.929
Huh?

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:00.998
Hey, how you doing, Cosmo?

00:03:00.998 --> 00:03:01.966
[Giggle]

00:03:01.966 --> 00:03:02.733
You hungry?

00:03:02.733 --> 00:03:04.702
I'm sorry, but I just
don't have time.

00:03:04.702 --> 00:03:07.138
This modification
job's a real pain.

00:03:07.138 --> 00:03:09.673
I told Chris I'd modify
the energy sequencer

00:03:09.673 --> 00:03:11.475
and reconnect it to
the Master Emerald

00:03:11.475 --> 00:03:13.144
with a stronger magnetic field,

00:03:13.144 --> 00:03:13.944
but if I do that,

00:03:13.944 --> 00:03:15.880
the frequencies will
get out of whack.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.750
I suppose I could bypass them
by going directly through the-

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.452
Uh, sorry about that.

00:03:21.452 --> 00:03:23.220
Didn't mean to get all
geeky on you again.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.289
Aw, don't apologize.

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:27.958
After all, you can't help it if
you're the smartest guy around.

00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.593
[Chuckling]

00:03:29.593 --> 00:03:31.829

up here right away!

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:32.797
You've gotta see this!

00:03:32.797 --> 00:03:33.764
Hm?

00:03:40.438 --> 00:03:44.308
[Electricity crackling]

00:03:47.244 --> 00:03:49.480
Look at all that energy
swirling around.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.815
I don't like this.

00:03:50.815 --> 00:03:54.318
I have a feeling if we go any
further, we might never come out.

00:03:54.318 --> 00:03:55.686
I'm with Tails.

00:03:55.686 --> 00:03:56.887
Chao chao!

00:04:02.193 --> 00:04:04.462
But we just can't
give up on them now.

00:04:04.462 --> 00:04:06.397
Okay, I'm gonna chance it.

00:04:07.364 --> 00:04:08.466
We're going in.

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:15.005
ALL: Aaaaaah!

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:17.675
I may be able to drag
it out of there.

00:04:17.675 --> 00:04:20.277
Activate Typhoon Claw,
and nice and slow.

00:04:20.277 --> 00:04:21.545

00:04:30.721 --> 00:04:31.689
Huh?

00:04:31.956 --> 00:04:33.891
That was easier than I thought.

[Laughter]

00:04:37.094 --> 00:04:39.697
Sorry to have to cut you off, kids.

CHRIS: It's Decoe!

00:04:44.301 --> 00:04:46.237
Correction— That
<i>was</i> Decoe.

00:04:47.204 --> 00:04:49.907
Maybe he doesn't want
our help after all.

00:04:58.082 --> 00:05:00.417
The Metarex! It's a trap!

00:05:00.417 --> 00:05:03.354
Hang on, everybody! I'm
gonna do a fast 180.

Be careful, Tails!

Eggman! I should have known
he's joined forces with them.

00:05:23.541 --> 00:05:28.846
All hail his royal honorary
Metarex, Dr. Eggman!

00:05:28.846 --> 00:05:31.048
Well, Black Narcissus?

00:05:31.048 --> 00:05:32.149
What have you got to say?

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:34.151
Don't I at least get a "thank you?"

00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:37.555
After all, it was I who lured Team
Sonic into your galactic web.

00:05:37.555 --> 00:05:39.857
Not the most difficult
of achievements.

00:05:39.857 --> 00:05:43.360
You will learn, Eggman, that I am
not given to displays of gratitude.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.328
Well, just so you know,

00:05:44.328 --> 00:05:48.566
they wouldn't be here if it wasn't for
my finely honed genius for deception.

00:05:48.566 --> 00:05:50.668
And there are more tricks
where that came from,

00:05:50.668 --> 00:05:53.137
just so long as I'm compensated.

00:05:53.137 --> 00:05:55.105
Don't worry, Doctor.

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:56.307
You will be.

00:05:56.307 --> 00:05:58.842
It's past 1800 hours.

00:05:58.842 --> 00:06:00.411
Let's do this, boys.

00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:02.713
Launch Operation Swarm immediately!

00:06:02.713 --> 00:06:03.714

00:06:04.348 --> 00:06:07.384
Yeah! Yeah! Get 'em! Get 'em!

00:06:07.384 --> 00:06:10.187
Who does that rotund wretch
think he is, anyway?

00:06:10.187 --> 00:06:11.989
Now, calm down, Zelkova!

00:06:11.989 --> 00:06:14.592
Remember, it was thanks to
Eggman's tactical know-how

00:06:14.592 --> 00:06:17.695
that we were able to plan this
operation in the first place.

00:06:17.695 --> 00:06:19.730
In addition, the
Master has ordered us

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.333
to go along with anything
the doctor says.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.268
You can't be serious!

00:06:24.268 --> 00:06:25.536
He's nothing but a fool!

00:06:25.536 --> 00:06:28.072
<i>Bokkun singing</i> We're
gonna go crush Sonic!

00:06:28.072 --> 00:06:29.840
Attention, Metarex fighter squad.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.408
The great doctor has spoken.

00:06:31.408 --> 00:06:32.843
You would think the doctor would

00:06:32.843 --> 00:06:35.212
show just an ounce of
decorum, wouldn't you?

00:06:35.212 --> 00:06:38.115
What do you mean? He
is the picture of calm.

00:06:38.115 --> 00:06:39.750
How can you call that calm?

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:40.851
Just look at him.

00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:45.389
DR. EGGMAN &amp; BOKKUN: Go, Eggman! Go,
Eggman! Go, go, go Eggman! Go, Eggman!

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:46.757
I suppose you're right.

00:06:46.757 --> 00:06:48.158
He could chill out a bit.

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:50.794
BOKKUN: Go, Metarex!

00:06:51.695 --> 00:06:53.263
Oh...

00:07:03.507 --> 00:07:05.242
They're closing in, Tails.

00:07:05.242 --> 00:07:06.276
CREAM: What do we do?

00:07:06.276 --> 00:07:07.911
We can't turn around.

00:07:07.911 --> 00:07:10.814
And if we don't, we'll head
straight into that black hole!

00:07:10.814 --> 00:07:12.549
Either way, we're in danger!

00:07:12.549 --> 00:07:15.886
Okay, I say we forge ahead
and fight as hard as we can.

00:07:15.886 --> 00:07:18.255
Typhoon Tornadoes, let's move out.

00:07:18.722 --> 00:07:21.125
Hmm. Typhoon Tornadoes?

00:07:21.125 --> 00:07:22.760
It's our new team name.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.630
You couldn't think of anything
better than Typhoon Tornadoes?

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.733
The whole "Tornado"
thing is so cliché.

00:07:29.733 --> 00:07:32.803
Think maybe we could argue
about this later, Amy?

00:07:32.803 --> 00:07:34.638
Let's go get 'em!

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.745
Ready to launch nitro blasters.

00:07:51.522 --> 00:07:53.457
Let's kick it!

00:07:54.992 --> 00:07:57.161
[Grunting]

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.502
That's three points
for three ships.

00:08:06.603 --> 00:08:08.572
Well, that's inconvenient.

00:08:08.572 --> 00:08:10.307
Now onto Plan B.

00:08:10.307 --> 00:08:13.310
Of course, I haven't exactly
formulated a Plan B.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.945
Have no fear, Doctor.

00:08:14.945 --> 00:08:18.115
You see, I have a Plan
B of my own in store.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.618
As do I.

00:08:21.618 --> 00:08:22.586
What?!

00:08:22.586 --> 00:08:23.520
Ugh!

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.089
Well, so do I!

00:08:25.089 --> 00:08:26.323
Huh!

00:08:29.393 --> 00:08:30.661
Aaah!

00:08:32.463 --> 00:08:33.430

[Cream yelps]

00:08:48.846 --> 00:08:51.715
They're blasting their own
fighter planes, Sonic.

00:08:55.919 --> 00:08:57.621
Can you believe it, Doctor?

00:08:57.621 --> 00:08:59.556
And I thought I was a meanie!

00:09:03.694 --> 00:09:05.395
The shield's not working.

00:09:05.395 --> 00:09:06.930
They're too strong for us.

00:09:10.033 --> 00:09:11.869
They're firing at
anything they can.

00:09:11.869 --> 00:09:13.604
I think we should retreat, fast.

00:09:13.604 --> 00:09:14.872
But we can't turn back.

00:09:14.872 --> 00:09:16.006
We've come too far.

00:09:16.006 --> 00:09:17.708
What do you say,
Tails? Do we fight?

00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:21.078
We'll use the Power Cannon.

00:09:21.078 --> 00:09:24.448
The best thing to do is to aim
directly for the mother ship.

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:29.453
Okay, Tails!

00:09:29.453 --> 00:09:30.654
Ready, Cream?

00:09:30.654 --> 00:09:32.589
Let's give 'em all we got.

00:09:32.589 --> 00:09:33.957
Target lock...

00:09:33.957 --> 00:09:34.925
On!

00:09:34.925 --> 00:09:37.828
CHRIS: Okay, Sonic, get ready!

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.868
Prepare Power Cannon!

00:09:44.868 --> 00:09:46.537
Okay, fire!

00:09:56.613 --> 00:09:58.549
Let's have some fun.

00:09:58.549 --> 00:10:00.117
Star Shield up.

00:10:05.856 --> 00:10:17.167

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.605
Ohh!

00:10:25.142 --> 00:10:26.343
Sonic!

00:10:26.343 --> 00:10:28.879
[Crackling]

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:30.214
Hang on!

00:10:30.214 --> 00:10:33.717
[Grunt]

00:10:33.717 --> 00:10:35.485
Aahh!

00:10:35.953 --> 00:10:38.689
Oh, no! Sonic got zapped out there!

00:10:38.689 --> 00:10:40.290
What have I done?

00:10:49.878 --> 00:10:52.780
[Crackling]

00:10:54.215 --> 00:10:57.919
[Both groaning]

00:10:57.919 --> 00:11:01.155
That blast sure did do some
damage to the main engine.

00:11:01.155 --> 00:11:02.557
But I think we'll be okay,

00:11:02.557 --> 00:11:05.326
just as long as we can keep
it under a certain speed.

00:11:05.326 --> 00:11:07.595
We have to conserve
whatever energy we've got

00:11:07.595 --> 00:11:11.132
until we can recharge that
Master Emerald, okay, Tails?

00:11:11.132 --> 00:11:12.066
Tails?

00:11:12.066 --> 00:11:12.934
Huh?

00:11:12.934 --> 00:11:14.736
You doing okay?

00:11:14.736 --> 00:11:17.372
Uh... yeah... I'm okay, Chris.

00:11:20.708 --> 00:11:24.245
That floating playground of
theirs is still chugging along.

00:11:24.245 --> 00:11:25.413
Quite impressive.

00:11:25.413 --> 00:11:27.615
Perhaps. But not for long.

00:11:27.615 --> 00:11:30.451
The Star Shield will deactivate
within five minutes.

00:11:30.451 --> 00:11:33.121
We will then launch a full-scale
attack against them.

00:11:39.894 --> 00:11:41.829
Oh, no! We're getting
a danger signal!

00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:42.864
What now?

00:11:42.864 --> 00:11:46.467
I'm not so sure the Typhoon can make
it through another attack, Tails.

00:11:46.868 --> 00:11:48.136
Oh...

00:11:52.106 --> 00:11:54.676
I... I'm not worthy to be captain.

00:11:54.676 --> 00:11:56.811
I'm just not.

00:11:56.811 --> 00:11:58.746
Tails, come back! [Gasp]

00:11:58.746 --> 00:11:59.914
[Panting]

00:12:01.316 --> 00:12:02.917
I'm back!

00:12:02.917 --> 00:12:05.386
BOTH: Doctor! Thank
goodness you're okay!

00:12:05.386 --> 00:12:08.022
We were beginning to worry
that something had happened.

00:12:08.022 --> 00:12:11.526
After all, those Metarex guys
are pretty tough cookies.

00:12:11.526 --> 00:12:14.996
Well, they may be tough, but they
got nothing on the big boss man.

00:12:14.996 --> 00:12:16.931
Oh stifle that idiotic
chattering, will you?

00:12:16.931 --> 00:12:18.599
Aww.

00:12:18.599 --> 00:12:20.501
This is serious.

00:12:20.501 --> 00:12:21.469
Hmm.

00:12:23.104 --> 00:12:25.506
Tails, please wait.

00:12:28.076 --> 00:12:30.812
How could I do something so stupid?

00:12:30.812 --> 00:12:33.247
Tails, you can't blame
yourself for what happened.

00:12:33.247 --> 00:12:36.150
It's because of me Sonic
and Knuckles are hurt.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:37.118
Face it...

00:12:37.118 --> 00:12:39.921
I don't have the right to call
myself captain of anything.

00:12:39.921 --> 00:12:41.723
How can you say that, Tails?

00:12:41.723 --> 00:12:44.926
Nobody but you could be
captain, and you know it.

00:12:44.926 --> 00:12:47.128
I'm just a big failure.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:50.698
Not in my eyes, you're not.

00:12:50.698 --> 00:12:52.266
Just think of the
hundreds the times

00:12:52.266 --> 00:12:54.502
you've helped your friends
when they were in trouble.

00:12:54.502 --> 00:12:56.871
I've never known anyone
as brave as you.

00:12:56.871 --> 00:12:57.572
Really?

00:12:57.572 --> 00:13:01.209
Just think of all the times you've
saved your friends from danger.

00:13:01.209 --> 00:13:04.846
I'm proud to be under the command
of such a noble captain.

00:13:06.781 --> 00:13:08.116
Hey, thanks!

00:13:09.884 --> 00:13:11.386
Howdy, kid!

00:13:11.386 --> 00:13:14.122
You and your pals getting ready
for the big, bad showdown?

00:13:14.122 --> 00:13:17.025
We're ready for anything you
and those Metarex dish out.

00:13:17.025 --> 00:13:17.992
Just try us!

00:13:17.992 --> 00:13:18.793
Hmm.

00:13:18.793 --> 00:13:21.996
Who'd have thought such big talk
could come from such a small fry?

00:13:21.996 --> 00:13:24.365
Where's our boy Sonic, by the way?

00:13:24.365 --> 00:13:26.701
Nursing an aching
noggin, I presume?

00:13:26.701 --> 00:13:27.301
Hmm.

00:13:27.301 --> 00:13:30.238
Well, while Nurse Amy is bandaging
up that blockhead of his,

00:13:30.238 --> 00:13:32.907
here's a little bit
of news for you.

00:13:32.907 --> 00:13:36.110
You have five minutes till
that Typhoon's toast.

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:38.046
Now, if I were in your place, kid,

00:13:38.046 --> 00:13:40.515
I'd say farewell to
my little friends,

00:13:40.515 --> 00:13:43.117
'cause this is gonna be a blast!

00:13:43.117 --> 00:13:46.621
[Evil laughter]

00:13:46.621 --> 00:13:48.589
Now what do we do?

00:13:50.124 --> 00:13:51.592
I don't know.

00:13:51.893 --> 00:13:53.327
TAILS: It's okay, gang.

00:13:53.327 --> 00:13:54.495
I got it under control.

00:13:54.495 --> 00:13:55.596
Huh?

00:13:55.596 --> 00:13:58.466
We've got five minutes left,
and that's five minutes to win.

00:13:58.466 --> 00:14:00.168
Tails, you're back!

00:14:00.168 --> 00:14:01.836
Now, let's take a
look at this data

00:14:01.836 --> 00:14:03.271
and see how we can beat 'em.

00:14:03.271 --> 00:14:04.772
That sounds great, Tails.

00:14:04.772 --> 00:14:05.773
Chao chao chao chao!

00:14:18.386 --> 00:14:21.289
If we can somehow reverse
the direction of the spin,

00:14:21.289 --> 00:14:23.925
then it's possible to create
a new magnetic field—

00:14:23.925 --> 00:14:26.494
one that's the direct
opposite of the first one.

00:14:26.494 --> 00:14:28.596
But what if we get
sucked inside of there?

00:14:28.596 --> 00:14:29.564
It may be tough,

00:14:29.564 --> 00:14:31.499
but it's the only chance we've got.

00:14:31.499 --> 00:14:34.802
We'll just have to give it every
ounce of energy we possibly can.

00:14:34.802 --> 00:14:37.472
There's just one problem
we haven't thought about...

00:14:38.005 --> 00:14:39.907
In order to reverse
the magnetic field,

00:14:39.907 --> 00:14:41.342
we'd have to use Ring Tunnel,

00:14:41.342 --> 00:14:43.411
but with Sonic knocked
out, there's just no way.

00:14:43.411 --> 00:14:45.079
SONIC: Who are you
calling knocked out?

00:14:46.247 --> 00:14:47.081
Ha!

00:14:47.081 --> 00:14:49.884
I'm not exactly down for
the count yet, Tails.

00:14:49.884 --> 00:14:51.085
When my captain needs me,

00:14:51.085 --> 00:14:53.221
nothing's gonna stop me
from giving all I've got.

00:14:53.221 --> 00:14:54.088
Ha!

00:14:54.088 --> 00:14:56.023
Then let's do it, you guys!

00:15:07.902 --> 00:15:09.770
Sonic is plotting something.

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:10.838
I'll give them this—

00:15:10.838 --> 00:15:12.306
They sure don't give up easily.

00:15:12.306 --> 00:15:12.974
[Chuckle]

00:15:12.974 --> 00:15:14.308
Hmm.

00:15:14.308 --> 00:15:16.244
I checked the Master
Emerald, Tails.

00:15:16.244 --> 00:15:17.678
It's stable.

00:15:17.678 --> 00:15:19.447
Great. Keep your eye on it.

00:15:19.447 --> 00:15:20.915
Emerald stabilized!

00:15:20.915 --> 00:15:22.316
Chris, we're ready when you are.

00:15:22.316 --> 00:15:24.018
Go ahead and activate Ring Tunnel.

00:15:24.018 --> 00:15:25.753
Aye-aye!

00:15:25.753 --> 00:15:27.288
Ring Tunnel!

00:15:39.467 --> 00:15:41.636
Star Shield deactivating in

00:15:41.636 --> 00:15:46.440
5... 4... 3... 2... 1!

00:16:03.324 --> 00:16:05.059
Nothing's happening, Tails.

00:16:05.059 --> 00:16:06.994
Now I'm scared.

00:16:06.994 --> 00:16:08.563
Chao!

00:16:11.465 --> 00:16:13.167
This is gonna work.

00:16:13.167 --> 00:16:15.736
After all, I'm a captain.

00:16:18.639 --> 00:16:19.273
[Crackling]

00:16:19.273 --> 00:16:21.776
Aaaah!

00:16:25.012 --> 00:16:26.914
Sonic, no!

00:16:31.018 --> 00:16:32.720
Sonic, I'm here.

00:16:38.759 --> 00:16:40.795
What are you waiting
for, you imbeciles?

00:16:40.795 --> 00:16:42.330
The enemy has broken through.

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.031
Fire! Fire!

00:16:46.534 --> 00:16:48.936
The firebombs are heading
right toward us—

00:16:48.936 --> 00:16:50.304
Thousands of them!

00:16:55.042 --> 00:16:57.245
Less than 30 seconds 'til they hit.

00:16:57.245 --> 00:16:59.547
Tails, what now?!

00:17:05.386 --> 00:17:07.989
A good captain always
believes in himself.

00:17:07.989 --> 00:17:10.324
They're counting on you, Tails!

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.311
Steady, Tails.

00:17:17.311 --> 00:17:18.746
Concentrate.

00:17:22.149 --> 00:17:24.084
Hmm. Huh? Huh?

00:17:32.293 --> 00:17:35.529
Okay, let's bring her in
slow and steady, gang.

00:17:35.529 --> 00:17:37.298
Now hang on real tight.

00:17:41.302 --> 00:17:43.337
[Crackling]

00:17:43.337 --> 00:17:45.840
We're losing engine power, Tails!

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.708
It's the Master Emerald.

00:17:51.812 --> 00:17:52.780
[Struggling]

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.716
I... gotta get... to
the Master Emerald...

00:17:55.716 --> 00:17:56.517
[Grunting]

00:17:56.517 --> 00:17:59.086
Let this work, please!

00:18:01.956 --> 00:18:04.725
AMY: Aaaaah!

00:18:09.096 --> 00:18:12.600
The... Seven Chaos Emeralds...
are the servers.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.536
[Beeping]

00:18:15.536 --> 00:18:17.471
Chaos is the power!

00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:20.374
Chaos is the power
enriched by the heart!

00:18:21.208 --> 00:18:22.910
Aaah!

00:18:33.854 --> 00:18:35.289
How could this happen?

00:18:35.289 --> 00:18:36.357
Unacceptable!

00:18:36.357 --> 00:18:38.559
Let's vamoose behind
the mother ship.

00:18:38.559 --> 00:18:40.361
That baby's about to blow.

00:18:40.361 --> 00:18:42.796
[Crackling]

00:19:05.653 --> 00:19:07.821
We did it!

00:19:07.821 --> 00:19:08.789
Ah!

00:19:09.323 --> 00:19:10.291
Oh!

00:19:11.825 --> 00:19:13.060
Ahh!

00:19:18.098 --> 00:19:21.802
I just... wanted to tell
you guys how sorry I am.

00:19:21.802 --> 00:19:23.237
Sorry?

00:19:23.237 --> 00:19:26.073
If it weren't for you,
none of us would be here.

00:19:26.073 --> 00:19:27.341
Thanks, buddy.

00:19:27.341 --> 00:19:30.344
Yeah thanks, pal—I mean, Captain

00:19:30.344 --> 00:19:31.812
Thanks, you guys.

00:19:31.812 --> 00:19:33.914
You're the best.

00:19:33.914 --> 00:19:37.414
