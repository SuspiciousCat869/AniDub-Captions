WEBVTT

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:16.850
[Sighs disgustedly]

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:39.907
Huh?

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:48.048
What do you want, Eggman?

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:52.853
Aah!
Please help me, Knuckles.

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:55.155
If we don't do something fast,

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:58.559
Sonic could make us prisoners
on this planet forever.

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:01.862
If we can gather all seven
of the Chaos Emeralds,

00:01:01.962 --> 00:01:03.797
there's a fighting chance
we can somehow

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.199
reverse the effect
that sent us to this world

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.001
and return
to where we came from.

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:10.337
Sonic knew he could use
the Chaos Emeralds

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:12.639
to warp himself
through time and space.

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:15.842
That's the reason
he attacked Chaos Control.

00:01:15.943 --> 00:01:18.478
He found out that I'd collected
all the Chaos Emeralds

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.781
to keep them out of his grasp.

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:23.517
You know how reckless Sonic is.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.787
I was afraid of what he might do
if he got hold of the emeralds,

00:01:26.887 --> 00:01:28.255
so I set up defenses.

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:31.191
But there was no stopping Sonic.

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:34.294
He was determined to push
his selfish search for thrills

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:37.497
all the way this time,
no matter who got hurt.

00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:40.801
Finally, Sonic invaded
Chaos Control.

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:44.438
And to my horror,
he finally achieved his goal.

00:01:44.538 --> 00:01:46.607
Sonic destroyed Chaos Control

00:01:46.707 --> 00:01:50.844
and sent us all here,
just for the fun of it!

00:01:52.913 --> 00:01:55.916
Sonic.
He's crazy.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.552
I've changed my ways
and want to live in peace,

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:01.088
but Sonic won't let me.

00:02:02.356 --> 00:02:04.491
[Crying]

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.062
What can I do?

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:11.898
He won't even give me
a chance to fix things.

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:13.000
I want to get us back,

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.835
but when I found one
of the Chaos Emeralds,

00:02:14.935 --> 00:02:16.470
do you know what happened?

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.171
Sonic snatched it from me

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:22.042
and said he's going to stay here
as long as he pleases.

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:24.044
That selfish hog!

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:28.215
He said that we can't leave
here until he says so.

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:30.784
He thinks this world's
a lot more fun than ours

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:33.520
and if we don't agree,
it's our tough luck.

00:02:33.654 --> 00:02:35.288
[Growls]

00:02:35.422 --> 00:02:38.558
You'd think he'd be more
concerned about his buddy.

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.228
Sonic isn't my buddy!

00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:44.297
I'm sick and tired of Sonic
turning everything into a game.

00:02:44.398 --> 00:02:46.533
Either Sonic
gives us that emerald,

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:48.268
or I'm going
to take it from him.

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:49.569
Be careful.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.773
Sonic says he'll crush anybody
who tries to get it back.

00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:56.176
So then, a battle
to the bitter end.

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:57.444
[Cries]

00:02:57.577 --> 00:03:00.881
[Thinking] My chronic Sonic
troubles are over.

00:03:00.981 --> 00:03:02.616
Go, go, go, go, go

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:04.184
Gotta go fast

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:06.353
Gotta go fast

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:09.423
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:03:11.058 --> 00:03:14.494
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:16.296
Got ourselves a situation

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:18.598
Stuck in a new location

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:22.102
Without any explanation

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.237
No talk of relaxation

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:25.872
Don't, don't, don't

00:03:25.972 --> 00:03:27.641
Don't blink, don't think

00:03:27.741 --> 00:03:29.476
Just go, go, go, go

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:30.944
Go, go

00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:36.483
Sonic is on the run

00:03:36.583 --> 00:03:38.385
Sonic, he's number one

00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:42.122
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:43.657
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:03:43.757 --> 00:03:45.659
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:48.228
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:50.130
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.499
Sonic X

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.302
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:57.337
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:03:57.437 --> 00:03:59.239
Sonic X

00:04:03.877 --> 00:04:05.445
A Chaos Emerald.

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:08.081
Does anybody know where they
come from or how they work?

00:04:08.181 --> 00:04:11.518
Nobody knows much except
that they're real powerful.

00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:15.088
I hope my analysis reveals
something about its makeup.

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:17.090
[Knock on door]

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.826
- [All gasp]
- ELLA: I know you're in there!

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:21.762
You haven't let me clean
your room in so long,

00:04:21.895 --> 00:04:23.330
I'm issuing a dirt alert.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.532
Oh, no, it's Ella!

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:26.833
Quick, Tails, hide!

00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:28.835
Huh?
Whoa.

00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:32.606
Whoa!

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.843
I thought I'd find
you up here, Christopher.

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:39.746
Oh.
Hi, there, Ella.

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:41.248
Hmm.

00:04:41.348 --> 00:04:44.484
Keeping this room dust-free
is a losing battle.

00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:45.886
Not that I'm complaining,

00:04:45.986 --> 00:04:48.955
but it's like trying
to vacuum a dirt road.

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:50.090
I...

00:04:52.192 --> 00:04:54.094
Aah!

00:04:56.696 --> 00:05:00.367
He's so precious!
Is this your toy?

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.869
I'm taking care of it.

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:06.840
Ahh.
It almost looks real to me.

00:05:07.374 --> 00:05:08.341
Oh!

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:09.976
[Grunts]

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.079
I think I'll go
outside and play.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.881
Ooh.

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.082
Me too!

00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:21.087
Oh.

00:05:21.188 --> 00:05:24.591
Wow, Tails,
that was a close call.

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:27.661
- We sure fooled her!
- Yeah. [Laughs]

00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:29.429
Can't I nap in peace?

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:30.664
[Laughing]

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:32.199
- Uhh!
- Uhh!

00:05:32.299 --> 00:05:36.136
Master Chris, what may
I ask is going on?

00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:39.172
We're just playing capture
the stuffed animal.

00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:41.274
[Laughing nervously]

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.644
Bye.

00:05:44.744 --> 00:05:45.879
I think I'll...

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:49.516
Sir, while I commend
your desire to stay fit,

00:05:49.616 --> 00:05:52.485
I would stick to adult
sports like bowling.

00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:54.788
You can't tell me what to do.

00:05:54.888 --> 00:05:57.991
I'll play ring-around-the-rosy
if I...

00:05:58.091 --> 00:06:01.561
Perhaps you should slow down.
Rest is important.

00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:04.464
And I believe
it's time for your nap.

00:06:04.598 --> 00:06:06.499
- I don't need a nap.
- You can play later.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.500
I have work to do!

00:06:07.601 --> 00:06:09.169
Come along, Mr. Thorndyke.

00:06:10.871 --> 00:06:12.405
[Sighs]

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:13.173
- Aah!
- Aah!

00:06:14.941 --> 00:06:16.209
Ow.

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:18.478
Huh?
Amy!

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:22.716
You know it's dangerous to go
wandering around by yourself.

00:06:22.816 --> 00:06:24.451
I just saw a news report.

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:26.820
It looks like they found
another Chaos Emerald!

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.488
- Oh.
- Oh.

00:06:28.588 --> 00:06:29.789
The strange energy spikes,

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.359
which seem to be coming
from the Silver Valley area,

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:34.461
have played havoc
with computers and machinery

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:37.230
across the entire region.

00:06:37.831 --> 00:06:40.133
I bet it's a Chaos Emerald.

00:06:40.267 --> 00:06:43.169
You know, Silver Valley
isn't very far from here.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.405
Let's check it out!

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:50.210
Hey, Sonic, you heard the news?

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.578
Huh?

00:06:52.312 --> 00:06:54.247
We're going to Silver Valley.

00:06:54.347 --> 00:06:57.217
Come along and we'll
have a picnic there.

00:06:57.317 --> 00:07:00.220
But we're going for the emerald.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.390
Nah, I've been there before.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.459
Huh?!
You went without me?!

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:10.096
So you stopped there
during one of your runs, huh?

00:07:10.196 --> 00:07:12.299
Yep, you guessed it.

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:13.867
Fine, Sonic!

00:07:13.967 --> 00:07:14.901
Come on!

00:07:15.035 --> 00:07:17.103
We'll have more fun
without him anyhow!

00:07:17.237 --> 00:07:19.472
How can we get there
without a car?

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:23.476
My grandpa's resting, and I
can't ask Mr. Tanaka to drive.

00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:26.146
If I drive,
I'm gonna get spotted.

00:07:26.246 --> 00:07:27.647
What can we do?

00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:31.151
Hey!
I know how we'll get there!

00:07:37.257 --> 00:07:40.126
Those stuffed animals
are really cute!

00:07:40.226 --> 00:07:42.896
Isn't he a little old
for those toys?

00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:45.398
They're all staring!

00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:48.468
It's okay, Chris.
We're almost at our stop.

00:07:48.568 --> 00:07:50.670
Don't talk.
They'll hear.

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:53.540
Hey, Chris, I need to blink.
What do I do?

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.441
Ohh!

00:07:54.541 --> 00:07:56.910
Hey, Mom, could I
get one of these?

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.678
Wake up, Mommy.
Lookit!

00:07:58.778 --> 00:08:01.548
Aw, please, can I have one?
Please, Mommy?

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:04.117
You said I could have
a toy if I was good!

00:08:04.217 --> 00:08:05.218
Aah!

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:06.219
Oh!

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:07.654
[Crash]

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.392
[Sobbing]

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.861
[Thinking] Ah.
Now if I could only blink,

00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:17.263
everything would be perfect.

00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:25.338
Hmm.

00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:31.111
Huh?

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:37.951
[Grunts, laughs]

00:08:40.053 --> 00:08:42.022
Message for you.

00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:44.457
Here you go.

00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:47.460
Sonic, I'm sick of all
your selfish stunts.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.496
This time you've gone too far.

00:08:49.596 --> 00:08:51.998
I'm challenging you
to a showdown.

00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:55.969
Meet me in Silver Valley
in one hour and don't be late.

00:08:56.069 --> 00:08:58.571
EGGMAN: This message was brought
to you by the Eggman Empire,

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:02.342
which is not responsible for
its content, except this part.

00:09:02.442 --> 00:09:03.476
Wah!

00:09:03.576 --> 00:09:04.911
[Laughs]

00:09:08.081 --> 00:09:10.917
[Coughs, growls]

00:09:11.017 --> 00:09:13.586
Knuckles is gonna regret that.

00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:24.264
TAILS: This picnic
was a super idea, Amy!

00:09:24.364 --> 00:09:28.068
It was worth the trip
even if there is no emerald.

00:09:28.168 --> 00:09:29.869
Shouldn't there be
a lot of people here

00:09:30.003 --> 00:09:31.471
if they found a Chaos Emerald?

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:34.674
Maybe something else
caused the energy spikes.

00:09:34.774 --> 00:09:37.210
I guess it must
have been a mistake.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:40.180
We can still have some fun
while we're here.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.182
We could take a hike
in the mountains

00:09:42.282 --> 00:09:44.584
or go swimming in the lake.

00:09:45.285 --> 00:09:46.486
Aah!

00:10:03.503 --> 00:10:05.738
[All groaning]

00:10:07.841 --> 00:10:09.976
- Aah!
- Eggman!

00:10:10.076 --> 00:10:11.978
[Laughs evilly]

00:10:12.078 --> 00:10:13.413
You rat.

00:10:13.513 --> 00:10:16.516
You tricked 'em into
broadcasting that news story.

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:18.485
Unh-unh-unh-unh.

00:10:18.585 --> 00:10:20.653
I generated
artificial energy spikes

00:10:20.753 --> 00:10:23.156
just like the ones
made by Chaos Emeralds.

00:10:23.256 --> 00:10:24.491
It isn't my fault

00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:26.826
if those newshounds
barked up the wrong tree.

00:10:26.926 --> 00:10:30.930
I hate to admit it,
but Eggman even had me outfoxed.

00:10:31.064 --> 00:10:34.667
Well, his plan failed
'cause we're out of here!

00:10:36.236 --> 00:10:39.272
EGGMAN:
[Laughs] You can't leave.

00:10:39.372 --> 00:10:43.276
I need you in case my first plan
to beat Sonic fails.

00:10:43.376 --> 00:10:45.211
Sonic isn't here.

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:47.714
[Laughs evilly]

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:49.983
He'll be here any second now.

00:10:50.083 --> 00:10:51.718
[Chuckles]

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:55.955
[Thinking] Where's Sonic?
He should've been here by now.

00:10:56.055 --> 00:10:57.690
Hmm?

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.826
Hey, there, Knuckles!

00:10:59.926 --> 00:11:02.829
You're late, slowpoke!

00:11:02.962 --> 00:11:06.032
Yeah, well, I stopped
to enjoy the scenery.

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:08.268
This planet is pretty cool.

00:11:08.368 --> 00:11:10.470
[Sniffing]
It's nice here.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.739
Yeah, you'd like
this world, too,

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:15.008
if you weren't such
a party pooper.

00:11:15.108 --> 00:11:16.910
Enough talk!
Let's go!

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.578
Aw, relax, will ya?

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:21.481
We have all afternoon
to duke it out, buddy boy.

00:11:21.581 --> 00:11:24.784
I'm not your buddy and don't
forget it, smart aleck!

00:11:24.884 --> 00:11:26.019
Now put 'em up!

00:11:26.119 --> 00:11:29.155
I didn't come here
to sniff the flowers!

00:11:29.255 --> 00:11:30.557
That's your loss.

00:11:30.657 --> 00:11:32.292
You don't know what
you're missing.

00:11:32.392 --> 00:11:34.460
But if you'd rather
get clobbered by me...

00:11:34.594 --> 00:11:35.562
Shut up!

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:39.232
Give me the emerald
you stole or else!

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:41.234
Ooh.

00:11:41.334 --> 00:11:43.469
Your brain's even slower
than your feet.

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.805
Huh?!
[Growls]

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:55.782
[Growling]

00:12:54.474 --> 00:12:57.210
Huh!
Not a bad view!

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:58.578
Whoa.

00:13:03.683 --> 00:13:05.118
Whoa!

00:13:29.108 --> 00:13:30.643
[Laughing]

00:13:59.038 --> 00:14:01.941
Hey!
Help me!

00:14:08.081 --> 00:14:11.451
It's lucky I fell
in the kiddy pool.

00:14:12.552 --> 00:14:14.487
Get ready.
You're going down!

00:14:14.587 --> 00:14:15.988
Huh.

00:14:16.089 --> 00:14:18.658
Let's end this now!

00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:20.760
Go, Knuckles!

00:14:20.893 --> 00:14:23.696
Show Sonic he can't keep us
stuck here!

00:14:23.796 --> 00:14:26.699
Our only hope is for you
to trounce that tyrant!

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:29.602
- Sonic.
- Do they have to fight now?

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:31.871
Can't they free us first?

00:14:32.004 --> 00:14:33.272
There!

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:35.208
Good work.
How did you do it?

00:14:35.308 --> 00:14:37.510
I used my screwdriver.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.012
You're really handy.

00:14:40.113 --> 00:14:42.014
No big deal.

00:14:42.115 --> 00:14:44.851
Now I just have to figure out
how this thing's wired.

00:14:44.951 --> 00:14:47.053
We don't have time
for this, Tails.

00:14:47.153 --> 00:14:49.622
Step aside!
I'll fix that robot.

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:51.524
No!
Don't!

00:14:51.624 --> 00:14:53.493
Hyah!

00:14:53.593 --> 00:14:54.927
Aah!

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:03.469
Huh?

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:04.837
[Growls]

00:15:06.873 --> 00:15:08.674
Whoa.
Huh?

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:13.379
Get him, Knuckles!

00:15:13.479 --> 00:15:14.714
It's Eggman.

00:15:14.814 --> 00:15:16.682
[Grunts]

00:15:19.051 --> 00:15:20.953
Get back here!

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:22.989
You quitter!

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:25.725
We'll settle this later.

00:15:31.898 --> 00:15:33.166
Hey!

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:35.902
Get us down from here!

00:15:36.002 --> 00:15:37.236
Look what you've done!

00:15:37.336 --> 00:15:41.240
You've wrecked my robot,
and it isn't even insured!

00:15:45.678 --> 00:15:47.580
Whoa!

00:15:54.687 --> 00:15:57.256
Hey, what's up?

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.192
Thanks, Sonic!

00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:01.160
It's not over, Sonic.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.964
My robot may be down,
but it certainly isn't out.

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:12.271
Huh?

00:16:19.378 --> 00:16:21.280
Attack!

00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:30.590
Huh?
Uh-oh.

00:16:31.757 --> 00:16:33.359
Whoa!

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:34.627
Grrrr!

00:16:37.763 --> 00:16:39.165
Ooh.

00:16:40.266 --> 00:16:43.135
This is a battle
between Sonic and me!

00:16:43.236 --> 00:16:45.638
I'll fight my way!

00:16:48.074 --> 00:16:49.675
Fight your way?

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:52.378
If you're going to insist
on fighting a clean fight,

00:16:52.478 --> 00:16:55.381
then I'm going
to start playing dirty.

00:17:02.288 --> 00:17:04.390
[All screaming]

00:17:12.265 --> 00:17:16.369
Plan "A" didn't work, so now
we'll have to go to plan "B."

00:17:16.469 --> 00:17:18.504
Bring me that Chaos Emerald

00:17:18.604 --> 00:17:21.507
or you'll never see
your friends again.

00:17:21.607 --> 00:17:22.642
What is this?

00:17:22.742 --> 00:17:26.312
Eggman swore to me that all
he wanted was to live in peace.

00:17:26.412 --> 00:17:29.348
He's sure tricky, isn't he?

00:17:29.448 --> 00:17:31.884
That swindler.
He lied!

00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:34.120
You're catching on, pal.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.888
EGGMAN:
Sonic!

00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:38.491
We all know
your weak spot is water.

00:17:38.591 --> 00:17:40.560
So I stuck
your friends over there

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.396
where you can't save them
without treading H2O.

00:17:43.496 --> 00:17:46.899
Yeah?
That's what you think.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.368
Huh?

00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:55.741
[All screaming]

00:17:58.477 --> 00:18:00.379
Show-off!

00:18:00.479 --> 00:18:02.381
You all right?

00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:04.650
I'm okay.

00:18:05.651 --> 00:18:06.886
Oh!

00:18:06.986 --> 00:18:08.588
[Crying]

00:18:10.556 --> 00:18:12.491
Take it easy, Amy.

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:16.228
I just knew that you'd come
here to save me!

00:18:16.362 --> 00:18:17.997
[Rumbling]

00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:18.898
Huh?

00:18:18.998 --> 00:18:20.600
Run!

00:18:23.736 --> 00:18:26.138
I'm not calling it
quits yet, Sonic.

00:18:26.238 --> 00:18:29.609
You only had a preview
of this robot's firepower!

00:18:29.709 --> 00:18:32.378
You and your friends
are through!

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:39.652
I've got you now!

00:18:48.694 --> 00:18:50.796
Let me take care of Eggman.

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:52.832
Okay.

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:03.209
[Roaring]

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:05.277
[Grunting]

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:10.216
You?!

00:19:11.717 --> 00:19:13.386
You liar!

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:15.021
Aah!

00:19:23.529 --> 00:19:25.498
[Grunts]

00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:52.491
Huh?

00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:03.736
AMY:
Sonic!

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:06.439
You both made it!

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:07.707
- Yeah.
- Oh, Sonic!

00:20:07.807 --> 00:20:11.177
Knuckles and I
had it all under control.

00:20:11.277 --> 00:20:13.012
Huh?
Knuckles!

00:20:13.112 --> 00:20:14.180
Huh?

00:20:19.852 --> 00:20:22.021
I bet you want
to apologize to Sonic

00:20:22.121 --> 00:20:24.990
for believing all the lies
Eggman told about him.

00:20:25.091 --> 00:20:27.059
And you probably
want to thank him, too,

00:20:27.193 --> 00:20:28.728
only you're too proud.

00:20:28.861 --> 00:20:30.429
Zip it!

00:20:32.531 --> 00:20:34.033
[Chuckling]

00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:39.705
Later.
