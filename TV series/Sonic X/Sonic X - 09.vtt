00:00:00.434 --> 00:00:01.802
AMY:
The new Emerald Coast Resort

00:00:01.902 --> 00:00:04.304
sounds like the perfect place
to get away from it all.

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:06.173
You can hang out at the beach

00:00:06.273 --> 00:00:09.576
or float in the crystal clear
ocean all day long,

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:12.813
then dine as you watch
a spectacular sunset.

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:15.349
It sound absolutely romantic.

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.318
I wish we were going
to the opening party.

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:20.821
We'll have fun
at the Thorndyke's villa.

00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:22.823
Are you ready to go, Cheese?

00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:24.324
Chao! Chao!

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:26.093
I'm ready, too, guys.

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:28.829
My flight plan will take us
right to the Emerald Coast.

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.466
Be careful, Tails, and try
not to let anybody see you.

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:33.734
They won't have a problem

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:36.036
as long as they stay
on the grounds of the villa.

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:38.038
I wish I could hang out
with them

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:40.040
instead of going
to the resort opening.

00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:41.909
I know, but your mother
can't make it,

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:43.777
so she needs you
to go in her place.

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:45.779
You won't have to stay long,

00:00:45.913 --> 00:00:48.315
and after, you can join
the others at the villa.

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:49.983
That's great.

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:52.686
I can give you
a swimming lesson, Sonic.

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:54.388
You guys go on without me.

00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:56.056
I'm gonna stay right here.

00:00:56.156 --> 00:00:57.391
Huh?

00:00:57.491 --> 00:00:58.625
Huh?

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:01.495
Sonic, you mean
you're not coming with us?

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:02.729
That's right.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.499
Have fun.
I gotta run.

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:08.235
That's weird.

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:12.105
I wonder why Sonic doesn't want
to go to the Emerald Coast.

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:15.175
It must be
because Sonic hates water.

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:18.478
He won't go near the ocean
because he can't swim.

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:27.321
I forgot that.

00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:29.323
But Sonic doesn't have to swim.

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:32.092
He could go running
on the beach.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.396
It's not gonna be as much fun
without Sonic.

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:38.365
[Horn honks]

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:40.801
ELLA:
Mr. Chris, we have to leave now,

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:43.070
or you'll be late
for the ceremony.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.572
Have a great time, Chris.

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:48.075
We'll meet up later.

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:50.077
Okay.
Don't be long.

00:01:50.177 --> 00:01:51.578
See you there.

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:53.313
Chao, chao, chao!

00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:55.082
And don't be nervous, Chris.

00:01:55.182 --> 00:01:57.084
That opening party
will be just fine.

00:01:57.184 --> 00:01:58.518
Uh, yeah.

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.587
[Chuckles nervously]

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:20.007
Next stop, Emerald Coast.

00:02:20.107 --> 00:02:21.775
Hang on.

00:02:26.847 --> 00:02:28.482
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

00:02:28.582 --> 00:02:29.983
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

00:02:30.717 --> 00:02:32.419
Here we go!

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.071
Huh?

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:54.441
Aah!

00:02:56.777 --> 00:02:59.680
Master Chris, remember
that you are representing

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.748
the Thorndyke family
on this trip.

00:03:01.882 --> 00:03:04.785
I'll do my best, Mr. Tanaka.

00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:15.195
Who needs the ocean?

00:03:16.897 --> 00:03:18.532
Go, go, go, go, go

00:03:18.632 --> 00:03:20.067
Gotta go fast

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:22.235
Gotta go fast

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:25.272
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:30.377
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:03:30.477 --> 00:03:32.145
Got ourselves a situation

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:34.481
Stuck in a new location

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:38.018
Without any explanation

00:03:38.118 --> 00:03:40.153
No talk of relaxation

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:41.788
Don't, don't, don't

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.557
Don't blink, don't think

00:03:43.657 --> 00:03:45.392
Just go, go, go, go

00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:46.860
Go, go

00:03:50.664 --> 00:03:52.399
Sonic is on the run

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:54.267
Sonic, he's number one

00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:58.004
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

This place is unbelievable.

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:51.358
It sure is, Amy.

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.460
I'm really glad we came.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.863
And we'll have even more fun
when Chris gets here.

00:05:05.605 --> 00:05:07.841
[Indistinct conversations]

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:18.185
Try to look interested.

[Laughs nervously]

00:05:25.592 --> 00:05:27.861
Lovely.

00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:31.731
I just wish Sonic were here
to enjoy this with me.

00:05:57.757 --> 00:06:00.093
It would be so romantic!

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:01.361
Oh!

00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:04.664
We'd be so happy!

00:06:04.764 --> 00:06:06.166
Huh? Ohh!

Oh!

You just ruined my fantasy!

[Panting]

00:06:38.365 --> 00:06:41.201
Just thinking about Sonic
can make me crazy.

You're so wonderful, Chad.

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:51.111
So are you, Wendy.

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:55.482
Sonic, where are you?

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.123
Chad, I made something for you.

00:07:03.223 --> 00:07:04.057
For me?

00:07:04.157 --> 00:07:08.328
Yes, it's nothing really,
but I want you to have it.

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:11.331
It's a lucky charm
for when you go in the water.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.333
It's just like mine.

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:15.035
Thank you.

00:07:15.135 --> 00:07:17.704
I'll always wear it
and think of you.

00:07:17.804 --> 00:07:19.372
Oh, Chad.

00:07:19.472 --> 00:07:21.041
Oh, Wendy.

00:07:24.844 --> 00:07:26.246
Hmm.

00:07:26.346 --> 00:07:28.882
I wonder what Sonic would say.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.752
Who's that for, Amy?

00:07:33.353 --> 00:07:35.956
Uh, oh, nobody.

00:07:36.056 --> 00:07:38.892
You didn't make that for Sonic,
did you?

00:07:38.992 --> 00:07:40.994
No, of course not.

00:07:41.094 --> 00:07:43.263
- Huh?
- Whoa!

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:57.677
I'm turning
the Emerald Coast Resort

00:07:57.777 --> 00:08:00.447
into my kind of stomping ground.

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:12.492
All right, time for my
deconstruction crew.

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:40.286
I have to find a way
to call Sonic.

00:08:40.653 --> 00:08:42.555
EGGMAN:
You're my first guests.

00:08:42.655 --> 00:08:45.058
Welcome to Eggman's Scream Park,

00:08:45.158 --> 00:08:49.062
where your first vacation
is guaranteed to be your last.

00:08:49.162 --> 00:08:50.063
[Laughs evilly]

00:08:50.163 --> 00:08:51.264
Stay back, Chris.

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:52.332
I will guard you.

00:08:52.432 --> 00:08:55.668
As your father's servant,
it is my duty to protect you,

00:08:55.769 --> 00:08:59.039
even if it means
sacrificing myself.

00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:02.709
Now it is time for both of us
to face our fate.

00:09:04.177 --> 00:09:06.079
ELLA:
Easy now.

00:09:06.179 --> 00:09:09.382
Tanaka, you aren't even
strong enough to lick a stamp.

00:09:09.482 --> 00:09:10.483
It's true.

00:09:10.617 --> 00:09:13.820
Right now,
our only hope is Sonic.

00:09:16.189 --> 00:09:18.058
Hey!

00:09:18.158 --> 00:09:19.092

Ohh.

but me.

like this at the seashore.

Sonic?

So, you're finally here,
are you?

00:09:37.377 --> 00:09:38.278
Yeah.

00:09:38.378 --> 00:09:39.779
Oh!

00:09:40.814 --> 00:09:44.250
A gang of robot destroyers has
been wrecking hotels and resorts

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.919
all along the Emerald Coast.

00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:48.788
The situation is growing
more dangerous by the hour.

00:09:48.888 --> 00:09:52.092
Authorities have issued
evacuation orders.

00:09:52.192 --> 00:09:55.528
[Grunts]
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!

00:09:55.628 --> 00:09:57.497
The owners
of the Emerald Coast Resort

00:09:57.597 --> 00:10:00.300
didn't invite me to their
opening, so I knocked it down

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.169
and turned it into my own
vacation destination.

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:07.507
It's now Eggman's Scream Park!

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:08.908
- [Giggles]
- Huh?

00:10:09.008 --> 00:10:11.578
I brought you
a personal invitation.

00:10:11.678 --> 00:10:14.047
Your friend Chris
is already there.

00:10:14.147 --> 00:10:16.049
He's having a great time.

00:10:16.149 --> 00:10:18.685
Stop by.
We'll have a real blast.

00:10:18.818 --> 00:10:20.320
- Hee hee hee!
- Ohh. Ohh.

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:22.422
Ohh!

00:10:29.028 --> 00:10:30.463
Oh, well.

00:10:44.944 --> 00:10:45.678
[Gasps]

00:10:45.778 --> 00:10:48.081
It's Eggman!

00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:50.683
Out of the way.

00:10:50.783 --> 00:10:53.686
I've got to save Chris.

00:10:55.522 --> 00:10:56.890
Aah!

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.425
Huh?
Amy, what are you doing?

00:10:59.526 --> 00:11:02.595
Sonic's gonna show up to help,
but if he doesn't,

00:11:02.695 --> 00:11:05.265
Chris will need
all the help he can get.

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:07.267
Okay.

00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:09.936
Here we go.

00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:22.048
I hope they make it back safely.

00:11:23.049 --> 00:11:24.517
[Laughs evilly]

00:11:24.617 --> 00:11:26.085
Build faster.

00:11:26.219 --> 00:11:28.154
Don't use too many
nails and bolts,

00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:30.323
and make sure
you water down the cement.

00:11:30.423 --> 00:11:35.295
I want these rides to be the
most dangerous in the universe.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.175
Well, well.

00:11:49.309 --> 00:11:50.276
Sonic!

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:51.778
Hiya, Chris.

00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:53.746
Thought I'd drop by for a visit.

00:11:53.846 --> 00:11:55.215
Huh?

00:11:55.315 --> 00:11:58.218
You fell right into my trap,
Sonic.

00:11:58.318 --> 00:12:02.956
I know you can't swim,
so I lured you to the sea.

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:05.191
Get him, Octoron!

00:12:20.373 --> 00:12:22.275
You won't get away.

00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:23.276
Oh, yeah?

00:12:23.376 --> 00:12:24.978
Just watch me.

00:12:29.115 --> 00:12:30.750
Let him go!

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.686
[Laughs]
I'm giving Sonic a choice.

00:12:33.786 --> 00:12:38.491
He can either forfeit the fight
or forfeit his life.

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:47.367
Well, how do you like the ocean?

00:12:50.203 --> 00:12:52.238
It's delightful.

00:12:52.372 --> 00:12:56.476
Good, then let's see how long
you're able to stay under.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:08.021
Don't let Sonic
slip out of your grip, Octoron!

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:10.089
Haul that hedgehog
back into the ocean

00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:12.492
and don't let him up for air!

00:13:27.373 --> 00:13:31.477
Come on, Octoron,
flex those tentacles!

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:34.781
Sonic.

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.485
Amy, wait!

00:13:39.619 --> 00:13:42.522
Let him go!

00:13:56.502 --> 00:13:58.404
How could you?

00:13:58.504 --> 00:14:00.907
Keep your rotten robots
away from my Sonic,

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.942
or you're gonna be sorry.

00:14:03.042 --> 00:14:04.510
Whoa!

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.379
Thanks, Amy.

00:14:10.083 --> 00:14:11.984
TAILS:
Hey, Sonic!

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:38.111
Oh, no!

00:14:42.915 --> 00:14:43.649
Sonic!

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.986
Whoa, lighten up, Amy.

00:14:47.086 --> 00:14:48.955
EGGMAN:
You won this time.

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:51.457
But I'm not through.

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:53.726
Yeah, right.

00:14:55.161 --> 00:14:56.696
What you did was crazy.

00:14:56.796 --> 00:15:00.967
I know, but you make me
do crazy things.

00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:02.402
Ohh.

00:15:02.502 --> 00:15:04.904
Everything okay down there?

00:15:05.004 --> 00:15:07.907
Yeah, Tails,
thanks for the ring.

00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:11.277
Thank you.

00:15:11.377 --> 00:15:11.911
Hey!

00:15:12.044 --> 00:15:13.446
Huh?

00:15:13.546 --> 00:15:17.450
Sonic, this is a bracelet I made
to protect you in the water.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:18.951
Oh.

00:15:22.455 --> 00:15:24.157
You made it for me?

00:15:24.257 --> 00:15:27.026
If you wear it,
it'll bring you good luck.

00:15:27.126 --> 00:15:28.394
Really?

00:15:28.494 --> 00:15:30.430
Mm-hmm.

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.498
Ohh.

00:15:35.201 --> 00:15:37.103
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.775
Your bracelet!

00:15:45.912 --> 00:15:48.414
I can't believe it.

00:15:55.321 --> 00:15:58.958
I told you I wasn't through
with you, Sonic, didn't I?

00:15:59.058 --> 00:16:01.794
My Quizon have merged
to form Serpenter,

00:16:01.894 --> 00:16:04.263
and it's ready to strike.

00:16:08.908 --> 00:16:10.743
Impressive, isn't it, Sonic?

00:16:10.843 --> 00:16:13.612
That thing is pretty tall,

00:16:13.746 --> 00:16:16.982
but I bet in a battle
it comes up short.

00:16:17.082 --> 00:16:18.984
EGGMAN:
You'll need more than speed

00:16:19.084 --> 00:16:20.986
to survive this robot, Sonic.

00:16:21.086 --> 00:16:23.022
Really?
Yo, fang face!

00:16:23.122 --> 00:16:25.691
Let's see how quickly
you can slither.

00:16:25.791 --> 00:16:27.593
After him, Serpenter.

00:16:27.693 --> 00:16:29.995
Get rid of that blue bozo.

00:16:30.863 --> 00:16:32.665
You heard your boss, slowpoke.

00:16:32.765 --> 00:16:34.967
Right here!
Catch me!

00:16:38.904 --> 00:16:40.606
[Crying]

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:49.448
I guess my charm
wasn't so lucky.

00:16:59.458 --> 00:17:02.361
All right, Serpenter,
you know what to do.

00:17:02.461 --> 00:17:05.831
Put the squeeze on Sonic,
and then toss him out to sea.

00:17:05.931 --> 00:17:07.032
Aah!

00:17:07.132 --> 00:17:10.336
Now you're gonna pay!

00:17:13.205 --> 00:17:15.107
Don't mess with me.

00:17:23.449 --> 00:17:25.851
Oh, my.

00:17:42.134 --> 00:17:43.936
Oh, no.

00:17:44.036 --> 00:17:47.139
Perhaps I better go.

00:17:51.143 --> 00:17:53.746
Aah!

00:17:55.447 --> 00:17:59.351
Aah!

00:18:05.758 --> 00:18:08.360
[Coughing]

00:18:15.067 --> 00:18:16.435
Aah!

00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:21.507
- [All gasp]
- Amy!

00:18:23.842 --> 00:18:25.644
[Inhales deeply]

00:18:29.315 --> 00:18:30.683
I can't believe it.

00:18:30.816 --> 00:18:32.284
Sonic's swimming.

00:18:32.384 --> 00:18:34.286
No, Sonic!

00:19:00.479 --> 00:19:02.881
[Giggling]

00:19:08.954 --> 00:19:12.358
Hey, Sonic, hold on!

00:19:14.293 --> 00:19:17.029
Wait for me!

00:19:27.506 --> 00:19:29.408
CREAM:
Wake up, Amy.

00:19:29.508 --> 00:19:31.210
Huh?

00:19:31.977 --> 00:19:33.879
Amy!

00:19:33.979 --> 00:19:36.582
You're awake.

00:19:36.715 --> 00:19:37.883
Where am I?

00:19:38.016 --> 00:19:40.786
You're back at Chris' villa.

00:19:40.886 --> 00:19:45.023
They brought you here after you
were pulled out of the water.

00:19:45.124 --> 00:19:46.792
Who brought me?

00:19:47.493 --> 00:19:51.063
Chris and Tails
in the X-Tornado.

00:19:52.498 --> 00:19:55.100
Is Sonic okay?

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.036
Yes, but he went back home.

00:20:01.073 --> 00:20:02.341
Oh.

00:20:05.677 --> 00:20:08.547
[Voice breaking]
The bracelet's gone.

00:20:08.647 --> 00:20:10.149
[Crying]

00:20:10.282 --> 00:20:13.886
I made it just for him,
and now it's gone.

00:20:14.019 --> 00:20:15.988
Oh, don't cry.

00:20:18.357 --> 00:20:21.326
It was a good luck bracelet
to protect him in the water,

00:20:21.427 --> 00:20:24.396
but I guess Sonic
had good luck anyway.

00:20:24.496 --> 00:20:28.000
I think Sonic's very lucky.

00:20:35.908 --> 00:20:37.643
[Sneezes]

00:20:37.743 --> 00:20:40.579
Sonic, you gotta stay
out of the water.

00:20:40.679 --> 00:20:41.647
Hmm.
