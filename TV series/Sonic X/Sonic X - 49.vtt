00:00:00.267 --> 00:00:01.902
Freedom fever is running wild,

00:00:01.902 --> 00:00:03.437
as fans of Sonic the Hedgehog

00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:05.372
embrace the new Freedom Movement,

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:07.875
adopting the carefree
lifestyle of their hero.

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:11.478
It seems the entire planet
is caught up in the craze.

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:12.179
Freedom!

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.314
The International Track
and Field Association

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:16.083
reports that runners
around the world

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:17.985
are setting new records every day.

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:19.386
Ah!

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:21.288
Wow! Eight seconds flat!

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:22.623
Ha ha!

00:00:22.623 --> 00:00:23.724
Yeah!

00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:25.526
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:28.629
Gotta go fast

00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:31.565
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:37.371
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:39.406
Got ourselves a situation

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:41.475
Stuck in a new location

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:45.078
Without any explanation

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:47.147
No talk of relaxation

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:48.782
Don't, don't, don't

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:50.584
Don't blink, don't think

00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:52.386
Just go, go, go, go

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:53.887
Go, go

00:00:57.558 --> 00:00:59.426
Sonic is on the run

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:01.328
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:05.032
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:08.702
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:01:08.702 --> 00:01:11.104
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:13.006
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:15.542
Sonic X

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:17.477
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:20.280
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.315
Sonic X

00:01:26.984 --> 00:01:28.986
[Bustling]

00:01:28.986 --> 00:01:31.289
I love working for
the Thorndyke family.

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.824
Now the only thing we have
to attack is crabgrass.

00:01:33.824 --> 00:01:34.792
[Giggling]

00:01:34.792 --> 00:01:36.460
Plus we get weekends off.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.162
Eggman never gave us free time

00:01:38.162 --> 00:01:40.598
except the times he
made us work for free.

00:01:40.598 --> 00:01:41.165
[Both giggling]

00:01:41.165 --> 00:01:42.967
Hey, how's it going, you guys?

00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:44.235
Hello, Christopher.

00:01:44.235 --> 00:01:45.336
Welcome home.

00:01:45.336 --> 00:01:48.773
Your parents just arrived
back here a few minutes ago.

00:01:48.773 --> 00:01:50.007
Great. Where are they?

00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:51.275
In the backyard.

00:01:51.275 --> 00:01:53.144
They are extremely
eager to see you.

00:01:53.144 --> 00:01:54.212
Thanks, guys.

00:01:54.212 --> 00:01:55.646
What a nice kid.

00:01:55.646 --> 00:01:57.682
It is hard to believe
that a few days ago,

00:01:57.682 --> 00:01:59.450
we were trying to destroy him.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.185
I guess we should get back to work.

00:02:01.185 --> 00:02:04.088
Right! We still have to fill
in that ditch we dug earlier.

00:02:04.088 --> 00:02:05.056
Aaaah!

00:02:05.056 --> 00:02:06.023
Oh!

00:02:11.262 --> 00:02:12.863
EGGMAN: Bon appetit!

00:02:13.197 --> 00:02:15.666
Aww. A tree stump?

00:02:15.666 --> 00:02:17.602
I can't eat wood for lunch!

00:02:17.602 --> 00:02:19.737
What do I look like, a termite?

00:02:19.737 --> 00:02:21.672
Well, it's the only food we have.

00:02:21.672 --> 00:02:22.873
But if you don't like it,

00:02:22.873 --> 00:02:25.743
we can skip right to the
mud pie I made for dessert.

00:02:25.743 --> 00:02:28.646
I hope Decoe and Bocoe
ask for their jobs back.

00:02:28.646 --> 00:02:30.581
Their food didn't taste good,

00:02:30.581 --> 00:02:33.017
but they never served
me lumber for lunch.

00:02:33.017 --> 00:02:34.252
Forget it.

00:02:34.252 --> 00:02:36.053
I wouldn't take those
two turncoats back if

00:02:36.053 --> 00:02:38.522
they came crawling to
me on their gearboxes.

00:02:38.522 --> 00:02:40.224
[Crying]

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:46.731
[Everyone laughing and giggling]

00:02:47.298 --> 00:02:48.499
Here, Ella.

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:50.167
Oh... No, thank you, sir.

00:02:50.167 --> 00:02:52.103
There might not be
enough to go around...

00:02:52.103 --> 00:02:53.070
Heh...

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.373
Nonsense, Ella. We
have more than enough.

00:02:55.373 --> 00:02:56.774
That's... great.

00:02:56.774 --> 00:02:58.476
I know you love good food,

00:02:58.476 --> 00:03:00.645
so I expect to see
you back for seconds.

00:03:00.645 --> 00:03:02.280
Heh... heh.... Ugh...

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.849
When I heard all my employees
were taking time off

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.183
because of this freedom fad,

00:03:06.183 --> 00:03:08.085
I thought I'd take a
little free time, too.

00:03:08.085 --> 00:03:10.054
Christopher is thrilled
that you'll both be

00:03:10.054 --> 00:03:12.323
spending more time
here, and so am I.

00:03:13.024 --> 00:03:15.226
I never realized what
a burden stardom is

00:03:15.226 --> 00:03:17.161
until I joined the
Freedom Movement.

00:03:17.595 --> 00:03:18.729
Go, freedom!

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:19.730
All right!

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.233
My shish kebobs are done,
so get ready, gang.

00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:24.268
They're gonna knock
you out! [Laughing]

00:03:24.268 --> 00:03:26.570
I just hope the medics
will be able to revive us.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.772
[Everyone giggling]

00:03:27.772 --> 00:03:29.140
Professor Thorndyke.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.774
Hm?

00:03:29.774 --> 00:03:31.709
The President is on
the telephone for you.

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.010
Thank you.

00:03:34.812 --> 00:03:36.047
What's that?

00:03:37.014 --> 00:03:39.784
You're giving the go-ahead
to Project Homebound?

00:03:39.784 --> 00:03:41.752
I'll need some time to prepare.

00:03:41.752 --> 00:03:43.688
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

00:03:55.132 --> 00:03:59.337
[Sirens]

00:03:59.337 --> 00:04:00.971
Some of these freedom freaks

00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:03.641
think they've got the right
to break the speed limit.

00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:06.310
Every day, some joker
blasts down the highway

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.812
to challenge the S Team.

00:04:07.812 --> 00:04:10.715
There's only one racer
who outraces me.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.118
A sonic boom!

00:04:14.685 --> 00:04:17.288
He's moving faster than
the speed of sound!

00:04:17.722 --> 00:04:22.126
I never imagined a hotshot hedgehog
and I would become buddies.

00:04:22.693 --> 00:04:24.562
[Sirens]

00:04:24.562 --> 00:04:27.098
Sonic's the only real
competition I've got.

00:04:27.098 --> 00:04:29.967
This clown doesn't even
know what speeding means.

00:04:30.334 --> 00:04:31.969
Pull over, pal.

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:33.704
Don't make more
trouble for yourself.

00:04:33.704 --> 00:04:35.172
It's not worth it.

00:04:35.506 --> 00:04:37.775
He ain't catching me.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.093
[Sirens]

00:04:56.093 --> 00:04:57.728
Slow down!

00:04:58.362 --> 00:04:59.663
Aah!

00:05:06.937 --> 00:05:08.372
Oh, great.

00:05:11.275 --> 00:05:12.243
Huh.

00:05:27.758 --> 00:05:29.794
[Cowering]

00:05:29.794 --> 00:05:31.095
Sonic!

00:05:31.095 --> 00:05:33.531
Hey, Sam, how are
things on the highway?

00:05:33.531 --> 00:05:35.065
[Frustrated groan]

00:05:35.065 --> 00:05:36.400
Same stuff.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.303
I'm still showing these
show-offs who rules the road.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.206
I was about to go
on my coffee break.

00:05:42.206 --> 00:05:43.741
But now that you're here!

00:05:44.108 --> 00:05:45.743
[Panting]

00:05:45.743 --> 00:05:46.710
[Chuckling]

00:05:48.646 --> 00:05:49.613
Huh?

00:05:51.682 --> 00:05:54.385
Hey, what am I supposed
to do? Crawl home?

00:05:56.387 --> 00:05:57.788
You ready to race?

00:05:57.788 --> 00:05:58.756
You bet.

00:05:58.756 --> 00:06:01.425
Just let me shift into "sonic
mode," and I'm good to go.

00:06:10.167 --> 00:06:12.102
He's getting faster.

00:06:13.504 --> 00:06:14.405
[Grunt]

00:06:28.586 --> 00:06:29.987
[Sigh]

00:06:29.987 --> 00:06:31.922
This essay's really tough.

00:06:31.922 --> 00:06:34.058
I'm not sure what my dream is.

00:06:35.993 --> 00:06:38.229
My dream...

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:39.296
I know!

00:06:46.237 --> 00:06:47.872
This is Dr. Kim Bickley.

00:06:47.872 --> 00:06:50.474
She's a physicist from the
National Science Institute.

00:06:50.908 --> 00:06:52.476
Nice to meet you all.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.347
My dream is to help
my best friend Sonic

00:06:56.347 --> 00:06:58.282
make the world a better place.

00:06:58.282 --> 00:06:59.984
If I can just do that,

00:06:59.984 --> 00:07:01.952
I'll be happy.

00:07:01.952 --> 00:07:02.887
Huh.

00:07:03.521 --> 00:07:05.523
That sounds way too corny.

00:07:07.525 --> 00:07:08.492
Huh?

00:07:10.427 --> 00:07:13.130
[Water splashing]

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.065
What was that?

00:07:17.101 --> 00:07:18.068
Ah.

00:07:25.109 --> 00:07:26.076
Sonic!

00:07:31.882 --> 00:07:33.784
Yeah, I got a name.

00:07:35.753 --> 00:07:38.255
My name is Sonic the Hedgehog.

00:07:42.192 --> 00:07:43.160
Huh?

00:07:46.063 --> 00:07:47.031
Hmm.

00:07:47.798 --> 00:07:49.733
How ya doing, fella?

00:07:49.733 --> 00:07:51.669
[Cat meowing]

00:07:55.372 --> 00:07:56.507
Meow?

00:07:58.676 --> 00:07:59.443
Hmm?

00:08:04.181 --> 00:08:06.116
But how can time stop?

00:08:06.116 --> 00:08:07.618
It's impossible.

00:08:07.618 --> 00:08:09.153
I'm afraid it is possible.

00:08:10.487 --> 00:08:12.222
Sometime in the distant past,

00:08:12.222 --> 00:08:14.725
our world and Sonic's
were one and the same.

00:08:14.725 --> 00:08:17.695
Then a mysterious event
divided the world in two.

00:08:18.062 --> 00:08:20.598
Each world suddenly
had its own timeline.

00:08:20.598 --> 00:08:23.000
They now inhabited
parallel universes,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.702
unaware of the other's existence.

00:08:24.702 --> 00:08:27.171
The two worlds are
beginning to join again,

00:08:27.171 --> 00:08:28.572
and the two separate timelines

00:08:28.572 --> 00:08:30.708
will soon start to
join together as well.

00:08:30.708 --> 00:08:33.210
But how can you prove
this theory is true?

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:34.912
It's not a theory.

00:08:34.912 --> 00:08:35.913
Even as we speak,

00:08:35.913 --> 00:08:37.815
the two timelines are converging.

00:08:37.815 --> 00:08:39.683
Soon they'll meld completely.

00:08:39.683 --> 00:08:41.952
And when they do, they'll
cancel each other out,

00:08:41.952 --> 00:08:43.754
and time will stand still.

00:08:43.754 --> 00:08:45.689
The result will be catastrophic.

00:08:45.689 --> 00:08:48.225
The rejoined planets
will be frozen in time

00:08:48.225 --> 00:08:50.761
while billions of years pass
in the rest of the universe.

00:08:51.161 --> 00:08:54.632
Once the timelines are fused, the
effects will be irreversible.

00:08:55.265 --> 00:08:57.635
So we'll be stuck in time?

00:08:58.502 --> 00:08:59.703
That's right.

00:08:59.703 --> 00:09:03.073
When time stops, there's no such
thing as the future or the past.

00:09:03.073 --> 00:09:06.243
None of us will grow older, but
we won't be able to change either.

00:09:06.243 --> 00:09:09.246
Oh, my. Is there
anything we can do?

00:09:09.246 --> 00:09:11.181
I've made some calculations.

00:09:11.181 --> 00:09:12.549
If they're correct,

00:09:12.549 --> 00:09:14.785
there's a slim chance we
can prevent the timelines

00:09:14.785 --> 00:09:16.053
from coming together.

00:09:16.053 --> 00:09:18.956
But we have to act immediately,
or it'll be too late.

00:09:18.956 --> 00:09:20.224
The President has just signed

00:09:20.224 --> 00:09:22.092
an executive order
directing his staff

00:09:22.092 --> 00:09:24.128
to gather all the Chaos
Emeralds together.

00:09:24.128 --> 00:09:27.531
You mean the President wants
us to cause Chaos Control?

00:09:27.531 --> 00:09:29.466
Our only hope to save both worlds

00:09:29.466 --> 00:09:32.336
is to send you and Sonic
and the others back home.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.004
Hm.

00:09:34.004 --> 00:09:34.972
Huh?

00:09:36.373 --> 00:09:37.307
[Vase breaks]

00:09:37.307 --> 00:09:38.008
[Gasp]

00:09:38.008 --> 00:09:39.009
Huh!

00:09:39.009 --> 00:09:40.010
Huh?

00:09:54.494 --> 00:09:57.563
They're not gonna
send Sonic back home.

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:00.500
[Gasp] Chris!

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.034
You've been listening?

00:10:02.034 --> 00:10:04.537
Yes, I have. I heard it all.

00:10:05.938 --> 00:10:08.407
And I don't care what
the President says.

00:10:08.407 --> 00:10:10.343
It's good that Sonic's here.

00:10:14.847 --> 00:10:16.382
Sonic...

00:10:16.382 --> 00:10:19.118
Sonic always helps people
when they're in trouble.

00:10:19.585 --> 00:10:21.621
He saved Station Square

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:24.056
when it was attacked
by the Chaos monster.

00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:25.791
Don't you remember?

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:27.360
This whole planet
would've been wrecked

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.328
if Sonic hadn't come to the rescue.

00:10:29.328 --> 00:10:30.630
Sonic is staying here!

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.666
If he goes away, you'll be sorry!

00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:34.667
Oh.

00:10:37.904 --> 00:10:40.439
Sorry, Chris. We're in danger.

00:10:40.673 --> 00:10:44.010
It's not Sonic's fault, but he and
the others have got to go back.

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.511
Our whole future depends on it.

00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:47.446
You're wrong!

00:10:47.446 --> 00:10:48.681
Are you sure?

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:52.185
Dr. Eggman must be behind this.

00:10:52.185 --> 00:10:55.221
He's fooling everybody
to get rid of Sonic!

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.123
Chris may be right.

00:10:57.123 --> 00:10:59.091
This could be one
of Eggman's tricks.

00:10:59.091 --> 00:11:01.727
We can't wish this
problem away, Chris.

00:11:01.727 --> 00:11:02.461
Huh?

00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:06.232
I know it's hard to hear, but the
time has come to say goodbye.

00:11:06.632 --> 00:11:09.135
Sonic must return to his world.

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:10.102
There's no other choice.

00:11:10.102 --> 00:11:12.004
You can't send him away!

00:11:12.004 --> 00:11:13.940
Uh! I won't let you!

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.908
DAD: Chris, wait!
MOM: Honey!

00:11:21.647 --> 00:11:23.015
Hmm.

00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:25.151
TAILS: I never saw him this upset.

00:11:25.151 --> 00:11:27.453
I know exactly how he feels.

00:11:28.087 --> 00:11:29.989
I'm upset about this, too.

00:11:30.823 --> 00:11:32.658
If time were to stop,

00:11:32.658 --> 00:11:34.994
I wouldn't have to
grow older anymore.

00:11:34.994 --> 00:11:38.631
I'd have forever to do research
and make new discoveries.

00:11:38.631 --> 00:11:42.001
Why, just think of all the marvelous
things you and I could build

00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:44.870
if we could tinker in our
workshop for all eternity.

00:11:45.471 --> 00:11:47.940
It sounds wonderful,
but it's a trap.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:48.474
Huh?

00:11:48.474 --> 00:11:51.043
In a world where time
has stopped completely,

00:11:51.043 --> 00:11:53.312
the pursuit of scientific knowledge

00:11:53.312 --> 00:11:55.948
will ultimately be meaningless.

00:11:56.916 --> 00:12:01.020
We'd never be able to use our
knowledge to make real progress.

00:12:02.421 --> 00:12:04.624
Every day would be the same.

00:12:04.624 --> 00:12:06.826
I think you'll agree that
a world where nothing ever

00:12:06.826 --> 00:12:09.262
changes would be a
boring place to live.

00:12:12.765 --> 00:12:14.767
I'll miss you, my friend.

00:12:19.171 --> 00:12:20.473
This has to be a trick!

00:12:20.473 --> 00:12:22.241
Eggman is doing all this.

00:12:22.608 --> 00:12:25.511
Aah!

00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:26.646
Chris, no!

00:12:26.646 --> 00:12:29.915
We still have to stop
by the software store.

00:12:29.915 --> 00:12:30.883
Oh?

00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:32.752
[Panting]

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:35.855
I've been running around
looking all over for you two.

00:12:35.855 --> 00:12:37.323
What can we do for you?

00:12:37.323 --> 00:12:39.859
I need you two to
do me a big favor.

00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:41.961
Please, you have to
take me to see Eggman.

00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:43.129
Oh!

00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:45.097
Huh?

00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:46.132
Shh!

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.802
Be careful. Eggman
could have spies.

00:12:49.802 --> 00:12:51.537
We must talk privately.

00:12:53.005 --> 00:12:57.243
Oh, I wish we could help,
but it is impossible, Chris.

00:12:57.243 --> 00:13:00.379
We have no idea where Eggman
went after we left him.

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:02.381
There is nothing we can do.

00:13:02.381 --> 00:13:03.416
Oh.

00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:05.451
Your family must be worried.

00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:07.787
You should come home
with us, Chris.

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:08.554
No!

00:13:08.554 --> 00:13:11.023
I'll go look for Eggman
alone if I have to.

00:13:11.023 --> 00:13:12.525
That could be dangerous.

00:13:12.525 --> 00:13:14.060
I guess we have to help you.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.962
If I don't do something,
they'll send Sonic away!

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:18.898
[Sigh]

00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:21.500
Oh.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.270
Eggman will not be giving
us a warm welcome.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:27.440
I agree. We had better
prepare for a fight.

00:13:27.773 --> 00:13:28.741
[Both shrug]

00:13:28.741 --> 00:13:32.111
Stand back, Chris.
We have to transform.

00:13:32.111 --> 00:13:32.978
Decoe!

00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:34.013
Bocoe!

00:13:34.013 --> 00:13:35.548
Transform!

00:13:35.748 --> 00:13:37.850
Proceed with dome descent.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.353
Leg lift sequence proceeding.

00:13:40.353 --> 00:13:41.821
Link up now!

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:43.923
Transformation complete!

00:13:45.591 --> 00:13:46.559
Huh.

00:13:47.259 --> 00:13:49.195
Activate Bokkun Beacon!

00:13:54.834 --> 00:14:01.674
[Laughing]

00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:03.175
Not you guys.

00:14:03.175 --> 00:14:05.244
What do you two
traitors want from me?

00:14:05.244 --> 00:14:06.712
I need your help.

00:14:06.712 --> 00:14:09.482
I want you to bring me
to Eggman so we can talk.

00:14:09.882 --> 00:14:12.551
I wouldn't take you to see my
boss for a gazillion bucks.

00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:14.320
[Mockingly] Na na!

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.321
Oh!

00:14:15.955 --> 00:14:16.789
Whoa!

00:14:16.789 --> 00:14:17.656
Ohh!

00:14:17.656 --> 00:14:20.426
I'm so hungry, I can't
even stay airborne.

00:14:20.426 --> 00:14:22.661
Did you skip lunch today?

00:14:22.661 --> 00:14:25.264
It's all your fault for
ditching the doctor.

00:14:25.264 --> 00:14:29.735
His cooking is so repulsive that
not even bacteria will eat it.

00:14:29.735 --> 00:14:30.469
[Crying]

00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:31.504
How about a deal?

00:14:31.504 --> 00:14:33.439
Just bring Chris to see Eggman...

00:14:33.439 --> 00:14:35.508
...And we will cook something up.

00:14:35.508 --> 00:14:38.978
Then what are we
waiting for? Let's go!

00:14:42.748 --> 00:14:45.184
Forgive me for allowing
Chris to get away.

00:14:45.184 --> 00:14:47.052
I could not follow him in the dark.

00:14:47.052 --> 00:14:50.122
I no longer deserve to
be under your employ.

00:14:50.122 --> 00:14:53.025
Now, now, it's not your fault.

00:14:53.025 --> 00:14:55.995
Linsey and I should have been
more understanding with him.

00:14:55.995 --> 00:14:58.664
If this were a film, I'd
ask for another take.

00:14:58.664 --> 00:15:00.833
Isn't there anything
we can do, Nelson?

00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:02.935
Yes, I'm going to call
the President's office.

00:15:02.935 --> 00:15:04.703
I'm sure if I explain
the situation,

00:15:04.703 --> 00:15:06.872
he'll call on the National
Guard to search the area.

00:15:08.174 --> 00:15:09.975
I know exactly where Chris went.

00:15:09.975 --> 00:15:11.477
Hm?

00:15:11.477 --> 00:15:13.145
Then where is he, Dad?

00:15:13.145 --> 00:15:14.980
Shouldn't we go after
him right away?

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.217
I'm afraid Chris has gone
to confront Dr. Eggman.

00:15:18.217 --> 00:15:19.485
MOM: [Gasp]
DAD: Dr. Eggman?

00:15:19.485 --> 00:15:20.453
Oh.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.022
I think we should let him go.

00:15:23.022 --> 00:15:25.925
That boy is looking
for some answers.

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:28.861
He really believes Eggman
is behind all this.

00:15:28.861 --> 00:15:31.764
Maybe facing Eggman will
help him accept the truth.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.968
[Panting]

00:15:35.968 --> 00:15:39.438
Eggman, I won't let
you send Sonic away.

00:15:48.127 --> 00:15:49.294
Aah!

00:15:49.294 --> 00:15:50.429
Hm?

00:15:50.429 --> 00:15:52.831
Oh. It's you.

00:15:53.799 --> 00:15:56.902
I knew you'd come groveling
to get your jobs back,

00:15:56.902 --> 00:15:57.870
but it's too late.

00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:59.004
Eggman!

00:15:59.004 --> 00:16:00.906
So you brought me a prisoner.

00:16:00.906 --> 00:16:05.444
If you're trying to buy me
off, I congratulate you.

00:16:05.444 --> 00:16:07.479
[Chuckling]

00:16:07.479 --> 00:16:10.382
They brought me here
because I asked them to.

00:16:10.382 --> 00:16:11.350
Huh?

00:16:11.784 --> 00:16:12.918
You're doing this!

00:16:12.918 --> 00:16:15.487
You're the one making
time come to a stop!

00:16:16.121 --> 00:16:16.989
Who, me?

00:16:16.989 --> 00:16:20.626
It's a trick to make them
send Sonic back to his world!

00:16:20.626 --> 00:16:21.827
It won't work!

00:16:21.827 --> 00:16:24.329
I'll make you tell
everybody the truth!

00:16:25.698 --> 00:16:26.665
Huh...

00:16:28.934 --> 00:16:31.036
That plan isn't half bad.

00:16:31.036 --> 00:16:32.504
[Chuckling]

00:16:33.839 --> 00:16:38.143
[Evil laughter]

00:16:38.143 --> 00:16:40.012
You figured out my scheme, kid!

00:16:40.012 --> 00:16:44.016
I despise Sonic so much I decided
to bring time to a standstill!

00:16:44.016 --> 00:16:46.018
Then I tricked this world's
scientific experts

00:16:46.018 --> 00:16:48.520
into believing Sonic
had to be sent back!

00:16:48.987 --> 00:16:51.023
Now that you've caught
me, I'll confess.

00:16:51.023 --> 00:16:51.990
Ah!

00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.526
Grr!

00:16:54.526 --> 00:16:56.462
I'm not kidding, Eggman!

00:16:56.462 --> 00:16:58.764
You'd better make time go
back to normal, or else!

00:16:58.764 --> 00:17:01.233
Or else you'll throw
a temper tantrum?

00:17:01.233 --> 00:17:02.468
Face it, kid.

00:17:02.468 --> 00:17:04.269
Without Sonic here to back you up,

00:17:04.269 --> 00:17:06.305
your threats are as
hollow as your head.

00:17:06.305 --> 00:17:07.272
Oh, yeah?

00:17:07.773 --> 00:17:10.075
Please, Chris. Fighting
will not help!

00:17:10.075 --> 00:17:11.009
Look, kid.

00:17:11.009 --> 00:17:13.312
I didn't cause this
time-freeze problem.

00:17:13.312 --> 00:17:15.614
If your grandfather
creates Chaos Control,

00:17:15.614 --> 00:17:17.816
I'm going to get sent back, too.

00:17:18.317 --> 00:17:19.284
Huh?

00:17:19.284 --> 00:17:21.220
I can't build my empire in a world

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.155
where time has stopped completely.

00:17:23.155 --> 00:17:24.790
There's no future in it.

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:27.025
I have no choice but to go back.

00:17:27.025 --> 00:17:28.794
That's the truth, kid.

00:17:28.794 --> 00:17:29.762
Huh.

00:17:31.697 --> 00:17:32.664
[Crying]

00:17:32.664 --> 00:17:34.600
I don't believe you.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.601
Uh!

00:17:36.535 --> 00:17:37.503
Liar!

00:17:37.503 --> 00:17:39.805
You're trying to trick me!

00:17:39.805 --> 00:17:41.840
You're the one who's lying...

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.075
to yourself!

00:17:43.075 --> 00:17:45.744
You don't want to accept the truth.

00:17:45.744 --> 00:17:47.479
Deep down, you know that
once Sonic is gone,

00:17:47.479 --> 00:17:50.582
your life will have to go back
to the way it was before.

00:17:50.582 --> 00:17:53.352
Your days of adventure
are at an end, boy.

00:17:53.352 --> 00:17:56.622
Just like your friendship with
that hyper-annoying hedgehog.

00:17:56.622 --> 00:17:58.657
All your dreams have been
shattered, haven't they?

00:17:58.657 --> 00:18:00.793
[Chuckling] Life is
like that, kiddo.

00:18:00.793 --> 00:18:02.361
Take it from somebody who knows.

00:18:02.361 --> 00:18:03.762
Whenever you reach too high,

00:18:03.762 --> 00:18:05.497
life smacks ya down.

00:18:06.331 --> 00:18:07.266
Uh...

00:18:07.266 --> 00:18:08.300
But on the bright side,

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.936
at least you and I won't ever have
to see each other ever again.

00:18:12.604 --> 00:18:17.943
[Struggling]

00:18:17.943 --> 00:18:18.844
Aah!

00:18:18.844 --> 00:18:20.078
[Crying]

00:18:20.078 --> 00:18:21.547
Wait, Chris!

00:18:21.547 --> 00:18:22.981
Let him go.

00:18:23.549 --> 00:18:25.050
Hm.

00:18:26.018 --> 00:18:27.452
So long, kid.

00:18:28.187 --> 00:18:30.055
[Crying]

00:18:30.055 --> 00:18:32.591
No! It has to be a lie!

00:18:32.591 --> 00:18:36.061
[Panting]

00:18:36.795 --> 00:18:44.036
[Panting]

00:18:48.607 --> 00:18:49.575
[Sigh]

00:18:54.012 --> 00:18:56.014
I just can't stand waiting.

00:18:56.014 --> 00:18:57.816
I wish we could do something.

00:18:57.816 --> 00:19:01.653
Are you sure allowing Chris
to see Eggman was a good idea?

00:19:01.653 --> 00:19:03.789
I'll hire a team of
commandos to find him!

00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:05.724
That's absurd.

00:19:05.724 --> 00:19:06.692
Huh?

00:19:07.259 --> 00:19:09.194
BOTH: [Gasp] Chris!

00:19:09.995 --> 00:19:10.796
Hi, guys.

00:19:10.796 --> 00:19:11.797
[Sigh of relief]

00:19:11.797 --> 00:19:12.497
[Laughing]

00:19:12.497 --> 00:19:14.700
TAILS: Hi, Chris!
MOM: Sweetie.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.635
Sorry I ran away.

00:19:16.635 --> 00:19:18.604
We're just happy you're safe, son.

00:19:18.604 --> 00:19:20.505
Why, Chris, you're freezing!

00:19:20.505 --> 00:19:23.742
What he needs is a nice, hot
bowl of my chicken soup.

00:19:23.742 --> 00:19:24.943
Thanks, Ella.

00:19:24.943 --> 00:19:26.345
I'll go get cooking.

00:19:27.913 --> 00:19:29.414
Feel okay, son?

00:19:29.414 --> 00:19:30.916
Why don't you sit down?

00:19:30.916 --> 00:19:31.817
Okay.

00:19:31.817 --> 00:19:34.319
Let's go. We still have
a lot of work to do.

00:19:36.555 --> 00:19:39.458
We still have to find
two more Chaos Emeralds.

00:19:39.458 --> 00:19:41.159
The government's searching too,

00:19:41.159 --> 00:19:42.361
but even if they're found,

00:19:42.361 --> 00:19:46.064
we may not be able to build a
machine to initiate Chaos Control.

00:19:46.064 --> 00:19:48.600
I bet we can figure
somethin' out, Chuck.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.503
It looks like you'll have to stay
here a little longer, though.

00:19:54.606 --> 00:19:56.909
You can sleep in
tomorrow if you want.

00:19:56.909 --> 00:19:58.477
Okay. Thanks!

00:19:58.477 --> 00:19:59.444
Night, son.

00:19:59.444 --> 00:20:00.412
Goodnight!

00:20:02.614 --> 00:20:05.918
[Grunting]

00:20:09.855 --> 00:20:11.089
Sonic...

00:20:16.595 --> 00:20:17.596
Huh? Chris?

00:20:21.199 --> 00:20:22.601
Guess I imagined it.

00:20:22.601 --> 00:20:23.602
Hm?

00:20:25.304 --> 00:20:27.205
Woah!
