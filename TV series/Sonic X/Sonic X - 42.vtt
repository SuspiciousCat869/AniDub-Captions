to Sonic the Hedgehog.

appointments and stood both of us up.

but I guess he already did.

00:07:52.173 --> 00:07:53.341
[Laughing]

00:07:53.341 --> 00:07:54.309
[Sigh]

00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:57.078
Let's drop the subject and figure
out where we're gonna go.

00:07:57.078 --> 00:07:59.013
You just name it.

00:07:59.013 --> 00:07:59.881
The beach!

00:07:59.881 --> 00:08:01.416
That's kind of far.

00:08:01.416 --> 00:08:02.884
Well, Sonic doesn't like water,

00:08:02.884 --> 00:08:04.886
so we won't run into him there!

00:08:04.886 --> 00:08:06.287
You win, princess!

00:08:06.287 --> 00:08:08.490
If you wanna hide out
from Sonic at the beach,

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:10.425
then we'll coast to the coast!

00:08:10.425 --> 00:08:12.193
All right. Thank you!

00:08:12.193 --> 00:08:13.294
One more thing.

00:08:13.294 --> 00:08:16.197
Let's agree not to talk
about Sonic, okay?

00:08:16.197 --> 00:08:18.366
The hedgehog is now history.

00:08:18.366 --> 00:08:21.269
[Car peels away]

00:08:24.305 --> 00:08:26.341
DR. EGGMAN: Prison
food is the pits!

00:08:26.341 --> 00:08:28.710
This looks more like
sewage than soup.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:32.313
It is lucky for us that
we have no taste circuits.

00:08:32.313 --> 00:08:34.749
I'm hungry! Bring me more!

00:08:34.749 --> 00:08:36.751
We demand refills now!

00:08:36.751 --> 00:08:38.820
Hurry up, waiter!

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.788
Can it, or I'll throw
you in solitary!

00:08:40.788 --> 00:08:42.457
Dinnertime's over!

00:08:42.457 --> 00:08:44.058
Don't you realize a genius like me

00:08:44.058 --> 00:08:46.661
needs more food than
the average person?

00:08:46.661 --> 00:08:49.230
My superior brain burns
up millions of calories!

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:51.366
This kind of treatment is inhuman!

00:08:51.366 --> 00:08:53.368
And it is bad for robots, too!

00:08:53.368 --> 00:08:54.936
Knock it off!

00:08:54.936 --> 00:08:56.004
This is a prison,

00:08:56.004 --> 00:08:57.705
not a four-star restaurant!

00:08:57.705 --> 00:08:59.974
Here! Now pipe down!

00:08:59.974 --> 00:09:02.243
Slop some of that slop
in <i>my</i> bowl!

00:09:03.745 --> 00:09:04.512
Yeah.

00:09:04.512 --> 00:09:07.081
One more meal like this, and
I am going to self-destruct.

00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:08.983
I wish we were back at the base.

00:09:08.983 --> 00:09:11.786
I am dying for a
drink of motor oil.

00:09:11.786 --> 00:09:13.821
We cannot take much more of this.

00:09:13.821 --> 00:09:16.558
When are we going to get
out of here, Doctor?

00:09:16.558 --> 00:09:17.492
Relax.

00:09:17.492 --> 00:09:19.627
We'll be checking out
of this dump any minute.

00:09:19.627 --> 00:09:21.563
If everything goes
according to plan,

00:09:21.563 --> 00:09:24.532
our breakout team is about
to give Sonic the runaround!

00:09:26.434 --> 00:09:28.069
Hm?

00:09:28.069 --> 00:09:29.270
Oh!

00:09:29.604 --> 00:09:30.171
Woah!

[Evil laughter]

00:09:35.243 --> 00:09:37.312
What a coincidence
running into you!

00:09:37.312 --> 00:09:38.279
Hm.

00:09:48.823 --> 00:09:50.058
I have an idea!

00:09:50.058 --> 00:09:52.627
Let's play a game! A shell game!

00:09:52.627 --> 00:09:53.861
[Grunt]

00:09:53.861 --> 00:09:54.829
Oof.

00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:55.830
Fire!

00:09:58.299 --> 00:10:00.234

Ah...

00:10:10.278 --> 00:10:11.713
Huh?

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:17.552
All right!

00:10:17.552 --> 00:10:19.020
Huh? Oh!

[Banjo lick]

00:10:42.644 --> 00:10:45.546
Didn't you tell me you knew
a shortcut to the beach?

00:10:45.546 --> 00:10:48.216
[Laughing] Sure, but I didn't
say I was taking it, did I?

00:10:48.216 --> 00:10:50.284
I bet you're lost, aren't you!

00:10:50.284 --> 00:10:51.886
Hey, I never get lost.

00:10:51.886 --> 00:10:54.222
I just can't figure out
where I am sometimes!

Gr...!

Sure thing.

could use a bath, too.

I guess I should've put the top up
when we went down that dirt road.

We're not taking
any more shortcuts!

I'm buying a map,

00:11:25.453 --> 00:11:28.089

best route to get to the beach.

Don't you even care if we're lost?

It doesn't matter to
me where I end up,

00:11:38.633 --> 00:11:41.569
as long as I have
fun gettin' there.

00:11:43.504 --> 00:11:45.573
That sounds like something
Sonic would say.

Sonic?

know Sonic, do you?

Of course I know him!

00:11:53.681 --> 00:11:55.616
Sonic and I are extremely close.

than I could ever repay.

00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:39.293
Sonic came to the rescue again.

00:12:39.293 --> 00:12:41.028
The welcome mat'll always be out

00:12:41.028 --> 00:12:43.431
on my front porch for
Sonic the Hedgehog.

with my compliments.

Bye-bye! Thanks for everything!

Bye! Tell sonic I said "hey!"

00:13:04.785 --> 00:13:07.154
You know, I just
remembered something.

00:13:07.154 --> 00:13:10.591
Sonic and I are supposed to have
our race tonight, not today.

00:13:10.591 --> 00:13:13.260
Then Sonic only stood me up.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.895
I forget sometimes.

00:13:14.895 --> 00:13:16.664
I guess when you move
as fast as I do,

00:13:16.664 --> 00:13:19.100
it's hard for your memory
to keep up with ya.

[Laughing loudly]

00:13:22.003 --> 00:13:24.038

Yah!

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:56.937
Ha ha!

00:13:56.937 --> 00:13:57.872
Woah!

00:13:57.872 --> 00:13:59.774

[Grunt]

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.681

00:14:14.455 --> 00:14:18.025

late for my date with Amy!

[Grunt]

00:14:20.995 --> 00:14:21.996
Huh?

00:14:24.598 --> 00:14:26.167
[Explosion]

00:14:26.167 --> 00:14:27.802
I fooled you!

00:14:27.802 --> 00:14:29.437
While you were running
away from me,

00:14:29.437 --> 00:14:32.907
another robot was breaking
Dr. Eggman out of prison!

00:14:32.907 --> 00:14:34.175
[Evil laughter]

00:14:34.175 --> 00:14:34.809
[Grunt]

00:14:34.809 --> 00:14:35.876
Huh!

00:14:35.876 --> 00:14:37.478
Oh!

00:14:37.478 --> 00:14:39.447
Ugh! [Crying]

00:14:44.018 --> 00:14:45.319
Another robot?

00:14:55.196 --> 00:14:58.099
I guess I should just face facts.

00:14:58.099 --> 00:15:00.634
Sonic's always gonna be on the run.

00:15:00.634 --> 00:15:02.937
I guess the two of us
just aren't meant to be.

00:15:02.937 --> 00:15:03.904
Here.

00:15:03.904 --> 00:15:05.106
Thank you.

00:15:08.642 --> 00:15:10.377
You're like Sonic, aren't you?

00:15:10.377 --> 00:15:11.312
I wish.

00:15:11.312 --> 00:15:12.713
When Sonic wants to hit the road,

00:15:12.713 --> 00:15:14.582
all he needs are his feet.

00:15:14.582 --> 00:15:17.718
Unfortunately, I can't travel
very fast without a car.

00:15:18.686 --> 00:15:22.223
No car in the world can keep up with
Sonic when he's running at full speed.

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:25.159
Yeah, you're right.

00:15:26.427 --> 00:15:28.095
Then why race him?

00:15:28.095 --> 00:15:30.598
Hey, I still have to try.

00:15:31.398 --> 00:15:33.767
Yeah, that's the same way I feel.

00:15:35.769 --> 00:15:36.737
Huh?

00:15:41.609 --> 00:15:42.910
Roger.

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:44.211
I'll stay on its tail.

00:15:44.211 --> 00:15:45.713
Headquarters thinks that machine's

00:15:45.713 --> 00:15:48.115
headed for the jail where
Eggman's locked up.

00:15:48.616 --> 00:15:49.884
That thing'll break in,

00:15:49.884 --> 00:15:51.619
so Eggman can break out.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.955
If we let that thing
get to the city,

00:15:54.955 --> 00:15:56.657
Eggman will be on the loose again.

00:15:56.657 --> 00:15:58.659
We've got to stop it somehow, Sam!

00:16:00.261 --> 00:16:04.465
You're right, but my car's no match
for an armored beast like that.

00:16:05.032 --> 00:16:07.001
If you catch it, I'll stop it!

00:16:07.001 --> 00:16:10.137
Okay! Then hang on, Amy!

00:16:10.137 --> 00:16:12.006
[Laughing]

00:16:12.006 --> 00:16:13.974
I changed to racing mode!

00:16:13.974 --> 00:16:14.942
Oh!

00:16:29.323 --> 00:16:33.194
Now let's chase that mean machine
down and run it off the road.

00:16:33.194 --> 00:16:34.094
[Gasp]

00:16:51.975 --> 00:16:53.243
We're losing it!

00:16:53.243 --> 00:16:55.745
Don't worry! I know a shortcut!

00:17:15.232 --> 00:17:16.433
Steady, Sam.

00:17:21.905 --> 00:17:23.907
You only have one swing, Amy.

00:17:23.907 --> 00:17:25.842
That's all I need.

00:17:30.147 --> 00:17:31.648
[Grunting]

00:17:31.648 --> 00:17:33.116
Ha!

00:17:35.152 --> 00:17:36.887
[Grunting]

00:17:37.687 --> 00:17:38.488
[Grunt]

00:17:49.866 --> 00:17:50.834
[Gasp]

00:17:54.771 --> 00:17:56.072
We did it!

00:17:56.072 --> 00:17:57.774
Great work, Amy!

00:18:01.278 --> 00:18:03.213
Isn't this a great feeling?

00:18:04.381 --> 00:18:06.917
We're almost at Sonic speed.

00:18:09.186 --> 00:18:10.153
[Gasp]

00:18:16.793 --> 00:18:20.664
Sonic, now I understand
why you love to run!

00:18:27.304 --> 00:18:30.173
[All grimacing in frustration]

00:18:31.775 --> 00:18:34.311
Grr!

00:18:34.311 --> 00:18:36.279
[Nervous laughter]

00:18:36.279 --> 00:18:38.782
[All scowling]

00:18:38.782 --> 00:18:41.451
Oh, don't be angry at me!

00:18:41.451 --> 00:18:43.620
It's not my fault
you're still in jail!

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:44.588
Honest!

00:18:44.588 --> 00:18:47.057
[Crying]

00:18:55.298 --> 00:18:57.000
When we were racing down that road,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.935
I felt so alive. It was incredible!

00:18:58.935 --> 00:19:00.870
You could go even faster!

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:03.039
You should try supersonic speed.

00:19:04.007 --> 00:19:05.542
Maybe someday.

00:19:05.542 --> 00:19:09.412
You know, this turned out to be
one of the best dates I ever had.

00:19:09.412 --> 00:19:11.081
This is beautiful,

00:19:11.081 --> 00:19:13.583
and getting here was sort of fun.

00:19:14.651 --> 00:19:15.952
Hmm.

00:19:15.952 --> 00:19:17.487
Thank you, Sam.

00:19:17.487 --> 00:19:20.457
If it wasn't for you, I'd have
spent all day feeling sad.

00:19:20.457 --> 00:19:21.992
The day's not over yet.

00:19:21.992 --> 00:19:24.928
You could still be
in for a surprise.

00:19:26.196 --> 00:19:27.530
Huh?

00:19:31.601 --> 00:19:33.603
Hey there! Sorry I'm late!

00:19:35.939 --> 00:19:37.641
[Happy laughter]

00:19:37.641 --> 00:19:40.644
Sonic, you do care about me!

00:19:40.644 --> 00:19:42.646
Woah! Huh?

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.048
I'm ready to race, Sam.

00:19:45.048 --> 00:19:46.516
My car has a new engine.

00:19:46.516 --> 00:19:48.385
It'll blast right past ya.

00:19:48.385 --> 00:19:50.086
We'll see about that.

00:19:50.086 --> 00:19:51.621
Heh heh.

00:19:51.621 --> 00:19:53.390
[Groans]

00:19:53.857 --> 00:19:55.492
Ready when you are!

00:19:55.492 --> 00:19:56.326
Get set...

00:19:56.326 --> 00:19:57.460
Go!

00:20:05.602 --> 00:20:07.404
Grr!

00:20:07.404 --> 00:20:09.039
Those two guys!

00:20:09.039 --> 00:20:12.909
This was definitely
the worst date ever!

00:20:15.011 --> 00:20:16.780
CREAM: It's getting late, Cheese.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:19.449
We'd better go inside,
or Ella will get worried.

00:20:19.449 --> 00:20:21.918
I hope she's cooking
us a big dinner tonight

00:20:21.918 --> 00:20:24.721
because all that playing
made me hungry.

00:20:24.988 --> 00:20:25.989
Hey, look!

00:20:25.989 --> 00:20:26.990
Chao!

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:27.991
Chao chao!
