00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.768
Last time on Sonic X,

00:00:01.768 --> 00:00:03.570
Eggman discovered two
more Chaos Emeralds

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.072
hidden aboard a high-security
Metarex Fortress.

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:08.108
When the doctor suggests
that Sonic and the gang

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:10.644
team up with him to see who
can snatch the Emeralds first,

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:12.212
Sonic jumps at the chance.

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:14.114
Soon, with the help
of Rouge and Shadow,

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:15.815
Chris breaks into
the Metarex complex,

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:17.951
and after a bit of
digital detective work,

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:19.719
shuts down the security system.

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:23.056
But when Sonic and the others burst
in for a little Emerald espionage,

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:26.159
they're greeted by a mob of Metarex
with one thing on their minds...

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:27.661
total destruction!

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:30.564
Find out what happens next
on this week's Sonic X!

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:32.566
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.635
Gotta go fast

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:38.605
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:44.411
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:46.479
Got ourselves a situation

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.515
Stuck in a new location

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:52.118
Without any explanation

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:54.187
No talk of relaxation

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:55.822
Don't, don't, don't

00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:57.624
Don't blink, don't think

00:00:57.624 --> 00:00:59.426
Just go, go, go, go

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:00.927
Go, go

00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:06.466
Sonic is on the run

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.335
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:12.072
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:15.775
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:20.080
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.582
Sonic X

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:24.517
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.320
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.355
Sonic X

00:01:33.376 --> 00:01:40.183
[Metarex growling]

00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:41.685
Think you can beat me?

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.554
Make no mistake, my friend.

00:01:44.554 --> 00:01:46.790
I do not think I can beat you.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.425
I know I will.

00:01:49.126 --> 00:01:51.394
Metarex, prepare for battle!

00:01:51.394 --> 00:01:54.731
As you can see, you are
dangerously out-numbered, Sonic.

00:01:54.731 --> 00:01:55.999
And I warn you...

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:58.335
For every one of us
that falls in battle,

00:01:58.335 --> 00:02:00.737
there will be hundreds more
that will take his place.

00:02:00.737 --> 00:02:03.073
Please don't hurt Sonic. I beg you!

00:02:03.073 --> 00:02:04.975
We'll do anything you
want, Metarex, sir.

00:02:04.975 --> 00:02:07.544
We'll give back the Chaos
Emeralds and the Planet Egg,

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:09.012
but please don't hurt my friend.

00:02:09.346 --> 00:02:10.947
Get him.

00:02:10.947 --> 00:02:12.115
[Metarex growling]

[Gasp]

00:02:12.983 --> 00:02:13.950
Ah!

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.287
Sonic!

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:27.631
[Sigh]

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:29.699
[Grunt]

00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:32.702
So, you wanna play games, huh?

00:02:35.205 --> 00:02:36.773
[Evil laughter]

00:02:40.477 --> 00:02:42.045
He vanished!

00:02:42.045 --> 00:02:43.313
It's a hologram.

00:02:44.814 --> 00:02:48.885
[Metarex growl]

00:02:48.885 --> 00:02:50.287
Be careful, Sonic.

00:02:50.287 --> 00:02:51.421
Huh?

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:52.255
Huh.

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:56.259
[Metarex yell]

00:02:57.594 --> 00:03:00.130
[Evil laughter]

00:03:05.802 --> 00:03:08.805
I ought to knock that
egg-head of yours clear off!

00:03:08.805 --> 00:03:11.708
Now, now, Knuckles.
Let's just keep calm.

00:03:11.708 --> 00:03:14.344
We all know violence
never solves anything.

00:03:14.344 --> 00:03:15.979
Stay still, why don't you?

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:18.815
Any unnecessary movements
will send us plummeting.

00:03:18.815 --> 00:03:22.185
And from the looks of things,
that would be most inconvenient.

00:03:22.185 --> 00:03:23.086
[All shaking]

00:03:23.086 --> 00:03:24.487
What was that?

00:03:25.222 --> 00:03:27.791
[Beeping]

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:29.459
Blue Typhoon here.

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.694
Knuckles, do you read me?

00:03:30.694 --> 00:03:32.295
Tails, what's going on?

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:36.166
There's a nasty-looking battalion
of ships headed straight for us!

00:03:36.166 --> 00:03:38.068
I got a bad feeling those Metarex

00:03:38.068 --> 00:03:40.971
aren't too happy about us
crashing their fortress.

00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:43.807
Tails, I'm afraid they're
coming from behind, too.

00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:45.408
They're all around us.

00:03:45.408 --> 00:03:46.743
What are we gonna do?

00:03:46.743 --> 00:03:49.846
There's no way we can beat
that many, not without Sonic.

00:03:49.846 --> 00:03:51.781
CHRIS: Uh-oh. We're in trouble.

00:03:51.781 --> 00:03:53.083
ROUGE: You said it, kid.

00:03:53.083 --> 00:03:54.050
[Beeping]

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.252
DR. EGGMAN: Listen up, Shadow!

00:03:55.252 --> 00:03:56.920
In the interest of
self-preservation,

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.588
I'm calling off this clambake.

00:03:58.588 --> 00:03:59.723
I don't understand.

00:03:59.723 --> 00:04:02.158
I thought I was to retrieve
the Chaos Emeralds.

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:03.693
Oh, blast the Emeralds!

00:04:03.693 --> 00:04:07.564
These Metarex monstrosities are
about to make a meal out of us.

00:04:07.564 --> 00:04:10.033
RED PINE: Attention, intruders.

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:13.103
Make no effort to escape.

00:04:13.103 --> 00:04:14.738
I am Red Pine.

00:04:14.738 --> 00:04:18.842
I, and my three commanders,
serve the all-powerful Dark Oak.

00:04:18.842 --> 00:04:21.578
Great. There's three more of 'em?

00:04:21.578 --> 00:04:24.247
In your foolish effort
to undermine our mission,

00:04:24.247 --> 00:04:26.850
you have played directly
into our leader's hands.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.818
[Evil laughter]

00:04:28.818 --> 00:04:31.721
In fact, he wishes to
express his gratitude

00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:34.057
for bringing him
the Chaos Emeralds.

00:04:34.057 --> 00:04:37.927
Thanks to you all, we won't have
to blindly scour the galaxy.

00:04:37.927 --> 00:04:39.696
We don't know how to thank you.

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:42.265
Perhaps we'll just destroy you.

00:04:42.265 --> 00:04:44.801
Just try it, you
overgrown junkyard!

00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:46.503
DR. EGGMAN: What are you
waiting for, Shadow?

00:04:46.503 --> 00:04:47.804
Move it, or lose it!

00:04:47.804 --> 00:04:51.441
A genius like me can't afford
to dawdle with danger!

00:04:54.577 --> 00:04:57.981
Start ignition and begin Egg
ascension on the double.

00:04:57.981 --> 00:04:59.549
Yes, sir. Right away.

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:00.817
Wait just a minute!

00:05:00.817 --> 00:05:01.785
You wait!

00:05:01.785 --> 00:05:04.654
I'm not about to let those
metallic mutants maim me.

00:05:04.654 --> 00:05:05.622
See ya!

00:05:05.622 --> 00:05:06.923
Ah!

00:05:09.292 --> 00:05:10.927
Hey, come back!

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:14.698
Now what?

00:05:14.698 --> 00:05:17.400
I don't even know how to
fly this stupid thing.

00:05:18.034 --> 00:05:20.470
I have to get back to the doctor.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.406
No way. I'm not leaving
here empty-handed.

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:25.008
Shadow!

00:05:25.008 --> 00:05:26.843
[Beeping]

00:05:26.843 --> 00:05:28.078
AMY: Chris, do you read me?

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:29.579
Amy, what's wrong?

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:30.580
Please help!

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.515
They're gonna hurt Sonic.

00:05:33.316 --> 00:05:35.251
The Metarex!

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:43.293
[Metarex screaming]

00:05:43.293 --> 00:05:45.295
[Panting]

00:05:45.295 --> 00:05:47.797
Don't you worry, Sonic.
I got your back!

00:05:47.797 --> 00:05:49.299
Eat this, metacreeps!

00:05:49.299 --> 00:05:52.502
[Metarex yelling]

00:05:54.037 --> 00:05:55.004
Ah!

00:05:55.004 --> 00:05:57.273
Hey, what do you creepos
think you're doing?

00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:58.808
Get off of my ship!

00:05:58.808 --> 00:06:00.810
Oh, no! Amy!

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.746
Huh!

00:06:02.746 --> 00:06:03.813
Ha!

00:06:04.481 --> 00:06:06.716
Maybe the code I deciphered...

00:06:13.323 --> 00:06:14.524
[Gasp]

00:06:14.524 --> 00:06:15.492
Ah!

00:06:29.072 --> 00:06:30.807
Huh? Wha-? Wha-?

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:32.442
Where's the start button?

00:06:32.442 --> 00:06:34.677
Maybe... That's not it.

00:06:34.677 --> 00:06:37.013
Aw, where's that geek
Tails when you need him?

00:06:37.013 --> 00:06:37.914
Huh?

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:40.550
Whoa.

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:44.788
Attention all Metarex.

00:06:44.788 --> 00:06:47.190
The Planet Egg has been ejected.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.393
Without the Planet Egg,
this fortress is of no use.

00:06:50.393 --> 00:06:54.364
We must destroy the stronghold
and all who dwell within it.

00:06:54.364 --> 00:06:56.766
Metarex! Aim...

00:06:56.766 --> 00:06:57.734
Fire!

00:07:03.306 --> 00:07:05.241
Laser shield! Hurry, Cream.

00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:07.043
Laser shield activated.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.923
How long do you think
we can hold them back?

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:21.491
I don't know.

00:07:21.491 --> 00:07:22.759
Even with the shield up,

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:26.062
the Typhoon can't withstand
this kind of attack for long.

00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:29.732
Shadow, wait!

00:07:29.732 --> 00:07:32.535
Why can't we find a way
out of here together?

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:35.872
He's only interested in doing
what the boss man tells him.

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:37.807
You don't know what
you're talking about.

00:07:37.807 --> 00:07:39.509
Eggman doesn't care about you.

00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:41.444
He only wants to use you
to get what he wants.

00:07:41.444 --> 00:07:42.745
Don't you see that?

00:07:43.746 --> 00:07:45.014
You're wrong.

00:07:45.482 --> 00:07:47.016
Come on, now.

00:07:47.016 --> 00:07:48.952
Why else do you think he
keeps you hanging around?

00:07:48.952 --> 00:07:50.186
He wants to help me.

00:07:50.186 --> 00:07:53.423
You think he's gonna help you
get your memory back, don't you?

00:07:53.423 --> 00:07:55.692
Have you ever stopped
to think old Egg-head

00:07:55.692 --> 00:07:58.795
just might be using that promise
to get you to do his dirty work?

00:08:00.163 --> 00:08:02.665
Rouge is right. You
can't trust him.

00:08:02.665 --> 00:08:04.100
[Sigh]

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.602
Please, I know you don't remember,

00:08:05.602 --> 00:08:08.805
but you helped us before, and I'm
begging you to help us again.

00:08:11.174 --> 00:08:12.342
Shadow...

00:08:12.342 --> 00:08:13.676
All right, I'll help you.

00:08:13.676 --> 00:08:14.978
But just this one time.

00:08:14.978 --> 00:08:15.812
Watch it, bub.

00:08:15.812 --> 00:08:17.847
That's right. I'm
keepin' my eye on you.

00:08:17.847 --> 00:08:19.349
Talk about insulting.

00:08:19.349 --> 00:08:21.084
Chaos Control!

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:22.652
Ah!

00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:29.025
Huh?

00:08:32.529 --> 00:08:34.831
Well, certainly took
you long enough.

00:08:34.831 --> 00:08:36.032
Huh?

00:08:36.032 --> 00:08:38.001
Ugh.

00:08:38.001 --> 00:08:41.004
Well, if it isn't Chris.
Long time no see.

00:08:43.506 --> 00:08:45.775
Nice of you to drop in.

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:49.345
[Laughing]

00:08:53.292 --> 00:08:55.327
I see Shadow decided to play nice

00:08:55.327 --> 00:08:57.730
and rescue you from
those Metarex meanies.

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:00.633
He really is an agreeable
little fellow, isn't he?

00:09:00.633 --> 00:09:02.802
After all, a little squirt
like you would have been

00:09:02.802 --> 00:09:04.637
no match for those guys.

00:09:04.637 --> 00:09:07.440
I thought you said we were
all on the same team.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.142
I should have known you'd run
when the going got tough.

00:09:10.142 --> 00:09:13.512
Well, better safe
than sorry, I say.

00:09:13.512 --> 00:09:15.881
We don't wanna get
hurt, do we, kid?

00:09:15.881 --> 00:09:17.450
Hmm!

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.685
I'm not a kid, okay?

00:09:19.685 --> 00:09:21.854
Whatever you say, kid.

00:09:21.854 --> 00:09:25.324
Ah, yes. Another day,
another conquest.

00:09:25.758 --> 00:09:27.526
Let's not waste any more time.

00:09:27.526 --> 00:09:29.628
It's been nice knowing you, kid.

00:09:29.929 --> 00:09:33.466
Quit talking down to me like I'm
some kind of baby, will you?

00:09:33.466 --> 00:09:36.602
I happen to be 18 years
old, not that you can tell.

00:09:37.103 --> 00:09:39.505
But how? You're still
only bite-sized.

00:09:39.505 --> 00:09:40.473
Oh, yeah?

00:09:40.473 --> 00:09:42.408
Well, I'm tired of
you and those Metarex

00:09:42.408 --> 00:09:44.343
doing everything you
can to hurt my friends.

00:09:44.343 --> 00:09:46.512
So I'm taking matters
into my own hands.

00:09:46.512 --> 00:09:47.646
Really?

00:09:50.149 --> 00:09:51.350
Really.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.352
Ohh!

00:09:53.352 --> 00:09:57.757
[Grunting]

00:09:59.625 --> 00:10:01.393
That little thief.

00:10:01.393 --> 00:10:03.329
[Panting]

00:10:05.097 --> 00:10:06.198
[Grunting]

00:10:13.072 --> 00:10:14.373
Activate ignition.

00:10:22.248 --> 00:10:24.150
Here I come, Sonic.

00:10:32.224 --> 00:10:34.160
[Grunting]

00:10:35.561 --> 00:10:36.662
Aaaah.

00:10:36.662 --> 00:10:37.863
Ugh.

00:10:39.865 --> 00:10:42.368
[Gasp] Cosmo!

00:10:42.368 --> 00:10:43.335
Uhh!

00:10:44.737 --> 00:10:47.273
We're too outnumbered, Sonic.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.341
[Gasp]

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:52.111
Not so fast, freak.

00:10:52.111 --> 00:10:53.078
[Growl]

00:11:02.354 --> 00:11:05.257
What was that...crash?

00:11:06.225 --> 00:11:08.360
They're trying to
destroy this place.

00:11:09.528 --> 00:11:10.763
[Gasp]

00:11:14.233 --> 00:11:16.969
But why would they want to
destroy their own fortress?

00:11:16.969 --> 00:11:19.939
Especially with so many
Metarex still inside.

00:11:19.939 --> 00:11:21.707
It doesn't make sense.

00:11:21.707 --> 00:11:24.243
For the great and noble mission.

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:27.446
All will be sacrificed.

00:11:39.391 --> 00:11:41.460
Stop this, Shadow, please.

00:11:47.967 --> 00:11:49.301
[Grunting]

00:11:49.301 --> 00:11:50.870
Ah!

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:52.371
[Grunting]

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.875
Ugh...

00:11:59.578 --> 00:12:04.049
[Groaning]

00:12:15.261 --> 00:12:16.495
Oof.

00:12:24.603 --> 00:12:26.071
Shadow...

00:12:26.071 --> 00:12:27.539
He's trying to hurt me.

00:12:29.208 --> 00:12:31.076
If you let me have
those Emeralds, kid,

00:12:31.076 --> 00:12:32.611
I'll get you out of here.

00:12:32.611 --> 00:12:34.246
You know I can't do that.

00:12:34.246 --> 00:12:35.648
Well, your loss.

00:12:36.282 --> 00:12:37.182
Later!

00:12:37.182 --> 00:12:39.652
Aaaah!

00:12:39.652 --> 00:12:41.053
Aaaaaah!

00:12:41.053 --> 00:12:42.621
KNUCKLES: Chris! Hyaa!

00:12:43.088 --> 00:12:44.356
Huh?

00:12:46.025 --> 00:12:47.393
Knuckles?

00:12:58.871 --> 00:13:01.774
I'm scared, Tails. The
shields aren't working.

00:13:01.774 --> 00:13:03.375
What if they break through?

00:13:03.375 --> 00:13:04.543
Don't worry, Cream.

00:13:04.543 --> 00:13:08.247
I just fired anti-laser torpedoes
from Cannons 2 and 3.

00:13:08.247 --> 00:13:09.882
That'll hold them a while.

00:13:09.882 --> 00:13:12.651
Doctor, we are in a jam, big-time.

00:13:12.651 --> 00:13:16.422
Without those Emeralds to protect
us, we'll be laser lunch.

00:13:16.422 --> 00:13:19.825
That's right. It's that
Chris kid's fault.

00:13:20.125 --> 00:13:21.393
What is this?

00:13:21.393 --> 00:13:24.830
I'm getting a reading there's
a gravity field down there.

00:13:34.707 --> 00:13:38.143
My, my, those Metarex are
just full of surprises, huh?

00:13:39.645 --> 00:13:40.646
Ah!

00:13:52.157 --> 00:13:53.392
Huh?

00:13:56.795 --> 00:13:58.130
Sonic, catch!

00:13:58.130 --> 00:13:59.064
[Grunting]

00:13:59.064 --> 00:14:00.265
Huh!

00:14:03.202 --> 00:14:04.236
[Grunting]

00:14:18.384 --> 00:14:19.451
[Gasp]

00:14:27.626 --> 00:14:28.594
Oh!

00:14:30.796 --> 00:14:32.531
ALL: Oh!

00:14:34.266 --> 00:14:36.101
What is happening?

00:14:39.972 --> 00:14:43.242
They are gaining power
from the Emeralds.

00:14:56.355 --> 00:14:58.357
[Metarex screaming]

00:15:09.268 --> 00:15:12.371
Well, Sonic, I see you and
I have a lot more in common

00:15:12.371 --> 00:15:13.839
than I thought we did.

00:15:13.839 --> 00:15:14.807
Hm.

00:15:17.776 --> 00:15:19.711
Are you going to give
me those Emeralds?

00:15:19.711 --> 00:15:22.347
Or am I gonna take them
from you by force?

00:15:22.347 --> 00:15:25.617
You haven't got any use for
those Emeralds, and you know it.

00:15:25.617 --> 00:15:26.552
Hm.

00:15:27.619 --> 00:15:30.789
We all know you're just
collecting 'em for Dr. Eggman.

00:15:30.789 --> 00:15:33.358
He's really got you
fooled, doesn't he, pal?

00:15:33.358 --> 00:15:34.326
Huh?

00:15:34.793 --> 00:15:35.961
Huh!

00:15:35.961 --> 00:15:37.429
[Grunting]

00:15:38.664 --> 00:15:39.631
Oof!

00:15:40.666 --> 00:15:41.633
Uh!

00:15:42.167 --> 00:15:43.135
Huh!

00:15:44.002 --> 00:15:45.604
What are they doing, Amy?

00:15:45.604 --> 00:15:47.673
Why are they glowing like that?

00:15:47.673 --> 00:15:48.807
It's happening...!

00:15:48.807 --> 00:15:49.908
Chaos Control!

00:15:51.410 --> 00:16:01.286
[Sounds of fighting]

00:16:01.286 --> 00:16:02.354
Ah!

00:16:15.367 --> 00:16:17.102
What now?

00:16:33.719 --> 00:16:35.087
Huh!

00:16:35.454 --> 00:16:39.158
[Both groaning]

00:16:44.963 --> 00:16:48.467
[Both grimacing]

00:16:54.506 --> 00:16:57.743
I don't think I've ever
experienced gravity this strong.

00:16:57.743 --> 00:17:00.820
Do something, Tails! We're
getting sucked in there!

00:17:14.939 --> 00:17:18.008
The gravitational pull is
going to destroy the ship.

00:17:18.008 --> 00:17:19.777
We must go faster.

00:17:19.777 --> 00:17:21.479
Accelerate to full power.

00:17:21.479 --> 00:17:23.147
Do it... Quickly!

00:17:27.685 --> 00:17:30.154
Nooooo!

00:17:45.703 --> 00:17:48.606
Don't just sit there, you
good-for-nothing gadget brains!

00:17:48.606 --> 00:17:49.840
Do something!

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.276
We're doomed! We're all doomed!

00:17:59.683 --> 00:18:01.418
That's Eggman!

00:18:02.386 --> 00:18:03.788
Huh!

00:18:03.788 --> 00:18:05.089
[Grunting]

00:18:05.089 --> 00:18:06.590
Oh!

00:18:07.424 --> 00:18:09.093
[Grunting]

00:18:12.296 --> 00:18:14.265
Uggh!

00:18:15.199 --> 00:18:16.200
Aaaaah!

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.203
[Grunting]

00:18:46.697 --> 00:18:50.000
[Grunting]

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.068
CHRIS: Sonic!

00:18:51.068 --> 00:18:52.102
Huh?

00:18:52.102 --> 00:18:53.671
Thought you'd never get here.

00:19:04.448 --> 00:19:06.383
Come through, Master Emerald!

00:19:06.383 --> 00:19:10.254
We're begging you. Lend
us your mighty power!

00:19:15.693 --> 00:19:17.995
Our engine power's increasing.

00:19:17.995 --> 00:19:20.197
Bring it up to full speed, Tails.

00:19:20.197 --> 00:19:21.665
You got it, Chris.

00:19:21.665 --> 00:19:23.133
Full speed ahead!

00:19:40.084 --> 00:19:43.354
DARK OAK: It appears I have
greatly underestimated

00:19:43.354 --> 00:19:45.890
the power of these tiny warriors.

00:19:46.857 --> 00:19:48.225
[Evil laughter]

00:19:48.225 --> 00:19:51.629
Their resourcefulness
is to be commended.

00:19:51.629 --> 00:19:54.331
However, this was but a test.

00:19:54.331 --> 00:19:58.569
Soon we shall see just
how clever they can be.

00:19:58.569 --> 00:20:02.439
[Evil laughter]
