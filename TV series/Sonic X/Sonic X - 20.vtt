WEBVTT

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:11.612
DECOE: Dr. Eggman, the main
engine has been repaired.

00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:14.348
BOCOE: Everything
is in tip-top shape.

00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:15.849
Splendid!

00:00:15.983 --> 00:00:19.386
Now, why does it always take
you two slowbots so long?

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:21.288
It is because Decoe is grumpy

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:23.457
and wants to complain
about everything.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.194
This is the third time
I had to fix this hunk of junk.

00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:28.295
Ow!

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:31.732
I mean, it is a pleasure to work
on such a fine machine.

00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:33.634
Now, that's more like it.

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:35.903
You better watch
what you say, big mouth.

00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:37.538
You don't think the doctor
will throw me

00:00:37.638 --> 00:00:38.705
on the scrap heap, do you?

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:40.107
Now, let's get going!

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:42.776
We've gotta catch up
with that pesky Sonic!

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.511
- Aye-aye, sir.
- Aye-aye, sir.

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:47.180
Now, fire up the main engine!

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:50.517
Well, so far so good.

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:52.586
Now turn it up full blast!

00:00:52.686 --> 00:00:54.988
It is purring like a kitten,
Doctor.

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:56.957
Huh?
What happened?

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:59.192
We have a problem, Doctor.

00:00:59.293 --> 00:01:02.262
I am afraid the turbines
are malfunctioning again.

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:04.731
I thought you said you fixed
this contraption!

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:07.234
We did.
At least I thought we did.

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:09.336
Perhaps we can still repair it.

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:10.437
Do not bet on it.

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:12.940
I've had it
with this broken-down bucket.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.642
Perhaps it's time
to retire this old heap

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.811
and introduce
my newest creation.

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.680
- Say what?
- Say what?

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.550
All right, I can't hold
this off any longer.

00:01:23.684 --> 00:01:26.753
Have I got a surprise for you!

00:01:26.887 --> 00:01:29.790
CHRIS: We were all worn out from
searching for the Chaos Emeralds

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:31.191
and battling Dr. Eggman.

00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:34.227
I had a long vacation
from school coming up.

00:01:34.328 --> 00:01:37.230
I know just what you need.

00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:39.933
Why not take Grandpa
and your friends on a cruise?

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:41.768
I'm not using
the yacht right now.

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:43.170
You can take in some sun

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.705
and maybe get a look
at the glaciers.

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:46.907
CHRIS:
So that's just what we did.

00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:49.343
Nothing but relaxation
and fun in the sun.

00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:51.478
We'll get to the glaciers
in about four days.

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:52.512
SONIC:
Four days?

00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:54.781
TAILS: You mean we're
only halfway there?

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:57.684
CREAM: These yachts sure do
go slow, don't they?

00:01:57.784 --> 00:01:58.852
Give me a break, will you?

00:01:58.986 --> 00:02:01.388
Come on, pal,
I don't take to water.

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:03.624
Can't you see
I'm getting seasick here?

00:02:03.757 --> 00:02:04.725
[Laughs]

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:06.693
Please, I beg you!

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:08.261
I'm goin' crazy!

00:02:08.362 --> 00:02:11.465
Get me off of this thing!

00:02:11.932 --> 00:02:13.400
CHRIS:
Later that night.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.368
Ahh.

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:16.470
There, I feel much better now.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.673
Did you take those seasick pills
the doctor gave you?

00:02:19.773 --> 00:02:21.441
I sure did, my boy.

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:23.577
And now that old Grandpa's
feeling better,

00:02:23.677 --> 00:02:25.145
we're gonna have a lot more fun.

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:26.146
- Yeah!
- Chao!

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:29.349
You bet!
[Laughs]

00:02:29.483 --> 00:02:30.350
[Snores]

00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:32.886
Grandpa sure is
enjoying himself.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:35.889
Hey, Chris, I know we're
supposed to be relaxing and all,

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.125
but what's there to do
on this ship?

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:40.661
There's lots of stuff.
How about taking a swim?

00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:42.396
Tails is just being rude.

00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:44.431
Don't pay any attention
to him, Chris.

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:46.299
That's right,
don't forget, Tails,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.268
Chris' father
let us use this yacht

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:49.703
out of the goodness
of his heart.

00:02:49.803 --> 00:02:51.738
We should be grateful.

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:52.739
Well, Tails?

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.776
[Chuckles]
Okay, I'm grateful.

00:02:55.876 --> 00:02:57.144
Tails will be okay.

00:02:57.244 --> 00:02:58.845
It's Sonic I'm worried about.

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:00.247
I think he feels trapped.

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:03.483
I guess I'd go crazy, too,
if I were him.

00:03:07.688 --> 00:03:09.089
Here he comes again.

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.324
I've seen Sonic
go stir crazy before,

00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:14.194
but I've never seen anything
as bad as this.

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:15.595
Okay.

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:17.798
It's time for a meeting.

00:03:18.532 --> 00:03:19.266
Halt!

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:20.967
Let's have a little talk, Sonic.

00:03:21.068 --> 00:03:22.002
What about?

00:03:22.102 --> 00:03:24.638
- About you!
- About me?

00:03:24.738 --> 00:03:26.640
And about the way you're acting.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.709
I've never seen
such immature behavior.

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:31.712
We're on this ship for
10 more days and 10 more nights.

00:03:31.812 --> 00:03:33.013
Get used to it!

00:03:33.113 --> 00:03:34.481
Be brave.

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:36.683
And just remember,

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:39.986
bravery is not the absence
of fear, but the facing of it.

00:03:40.087 --> 00:03:43.957
Nobody wants to see their hero
carrying on like a big crybaby.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.026
They want him to meet
every challenge head-on.

00:03:46.126 --> 00:03:47.627
Remember that, Sonic.

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:50.297
Think Amy's really
getting through to him, Chris?

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.997
Mm.

00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:56.103
Now, go forth, hero,
and keep your head held high.

00:04:00.107 --> 00:04:01.508
Uhh.

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:04.878
He collapsed!
I was too overwhelming!

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:06.313
We've got to do something.

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:08.014
I think he's sick.

00:04:08.115 --> 00:04:10.517
Okay, I'll call Dad.

00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:12.252
Go, go, go, go, go

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:13.787
Gotta go fast

00:04:13.987 --> 00:04:15.989
Gotta go fast

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:19.059
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:04:20.694 --> 00:04:24.131
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:04:24.231 --> 00:04:25.932
Got ourselves a situation

00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:28.201
Stuck in a new location

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:31.738
Without any explanation

00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:33.874
No talk of relaxation

00:04:33.974 --> 00:04:35.509
Don't, don't, don't

00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:37.277
Don't blink, don't think

00:04:37.377 --> 00:04:39.112
Just go, go, go, go

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:40.580
Go, go

00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:46.119
Sonic is on the run

00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:48.021
Sonic, he's number one

00:04:48.155 --> 00:04:51.792
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:04:51.892 --> 00:04:53.293
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:55.295
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:57.864
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:04:57.964 --> 00:04:59.766
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:02.102
Sonic X

00:05:02.202 --> 00:05:04.938
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:05:05.038 --> 00:05:06.973
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:05:07.073 --> 00:05:08.875
Sonic X

00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:16.216
Well, I'm off.

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:18.819
It's been a real blast,
but I gotta split.

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:19.920
See you!

00:05:20.053 --> 00:05:20.887
Hey!

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:22.989
He isn't sick.
He's a fake!

00:05:23.123 --> 00:05:24.391
It's okay.

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:28.428
After all, why make him stay on
the boat if he doesn't want to?

00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:31.364
Enjoy your vacay, kids.

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:33.733
Catch you on the flip side, huh?
Aah!

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:34.935
Wow!

00:05:35.035 --> 00:05:37.204
What have we here?

00:05:37.304 --> 00:05:40.540
Isn't this something?

00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:45.745
What's going on?

00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:48.381
Good morning.
Nice day.

00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:49.816
Tanaka!

00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:51.351
What are you doing here?

00:05:51.484 --> 00:05:52.986
Who are all these people?

00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:54.387
These people are joining us

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:56.590
from the Silver Star
retirement home.

00:05:56.723 --> 00:05:58.258
It is Mr. Thorndyke's hope

00:05:58.391 --> 00:06:00.327
that you and your friends
will learn from them.

00:06:00.427 --> 00:06:02.362
They will be your coaches,
you see.

00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:03.496
Coaches?

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.867
AMY: But, Mr. Tanaka,
what will they coach us on?

00:06:06.967 --> 00:06:09.436
On how to relax.

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:12.372
You see, they have all
worked hard for many years,

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:14.941
and now the time has come
for them to relax.

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:16.776
They will teach you how to,
as well.

00:06:16.877 --> 00:06:18.511
No, thanks, Mr. Tanaka.

00:06:18.612 --> 00:06:20.814
I just want the helicopter
to take Sonic home.

00:06:20.914 --> 00:06:23.049
He will remain here!

00:06:23.183 --> 00:06:25.418
Even a great warrior
needs his rest.

00:06:25.518 --> 00:06:27.921
Constant battles
not only exhaust the body,

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:29.456
but also the mind.

00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:31.858
The warrior must relax
and be rejuvenated,

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.593
so that when next
he goes to battle,

00:06:33.693 --> 00:06:35.662
he is mightier than before!

00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:37.364
Hyah!

00:06:38.932 --> 00:06:42.502
Hey, where are you going?
What about me?

00:06:45.672 --> 00:06:47.140
No!
Wait!

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.842
Come back!

00:06:48.942 --> 00:06:51.344
CHRIS: And so,
from that afternoon on,

00:06:51.444 --> 00:06:54.514
our new friends taught us all
how to relax.

00:06:54.614 --> 00:06:57.484
Just look at that, Tails.

00:06:57.584 --> 00:07:00.053
Isn't it wonderful?

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:02.989
Sometimes life goes by so fast

00:07:03.123 --> 00:07:07.527
that we never take the time
to appreciate the simple things.

00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:12.165
Like a blue sky
and fluffy white clouds.

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:14.467
Ohh.

00:07:16.002 --> 00:07:17.671
[Moaning]

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:22.108
I understand you and your
friends are from another planet.

00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:24.945
My, it's so fascinating.

00:07:25.045 --> 00:07:28.381
Yeah, we've only been here for
a little while, but we like it.

00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:31.251
Everyone's been so nice to us
since we got here.

00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:34.154
I'm glad.
How lovely.

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:36.790
So, you come from
another planet, do you?

00:07:36.923 --> 00:07:38.091
Yes.

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:42.362
And so the lady asked Cream
the same question over and over.

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:43.363
Uhh!

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:47.534
CHRIS:
Sonic was so bored,

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:50.103
he tried to jump ship
all the way to shore,

00:07:50.203 --> 00:07:51.338
but he missed.

00:07:51.438 --> 00:07:53.873
15 times.

00:07:55.442 --> 00:07:56.343
Not bad.

00:07:56.443 --> 00:07:58.678
He went about five
nautical miles on that one.

00:07:58.778 --> 00:07:59.512
Mm.

00:07:59.612 --> 00:08:01.715
Little guy gets further
every time.

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:05.385
That Sonic can't relax
for one second.

00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:07.487
Oh, what's the use?

00:08:07.587 --> 00:08:10.223
I'll find somebody else
to play shuffleboard with.

00:08:10.357 --> 00:08:11.858
[Chuckles]

00:08:11.992 --> 00:08:13.960
Something tells me
you got a thing

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.428
for that little Sonic fellow.

00:08:15.528 --> 00:08:17.464
What makes you say that, mister?

00:08:17.564 --> 00:08:18.698
[Laughs]

00:08:18.798 --> 00:08:20.667
I can tell
just by looking at you.

00:08:20.767 --> 00:08:22.602
Is it that easy to see?

00:08:22.702 --> 00:08:25.305
Why, sure.
It's obvious.

00:08:25.405 --> 00:08:28.308
Then, again, Sonic probably has
that effect on all the girls.

00:08:28.408 --> 00:08:30.810
What girls are you
talking about?

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:35.682
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

00:08:35.782 --> 00:08:37.450
It sure is a beauty, eh?

00:08:37.584 --> 00:08:39.786
Those dimwits thought
they'd seen the end of me,

00:08:39.886 --> 00:08:41.521
but I've outsmarted them.

00:08:41.654 --> 00:08:45.191
I've got a shiny new base,
hidden where nobody can see.

00:08:45.325 --> 00:08:47.494
You have outdone yourself,
Doctor.

00:08:47.594 --> 00:08:48.695
Very impressive.

00:08:48.828 --> 00:08:51.531
You can say that again.
What a shocker.

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:54.200
I had no idea there was
another super-secret base

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.201
hidden down here.

00:08:55.301 --> 00:08:57.103
Of course you had no idea!

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:59.272
If you had,
it wouldn't have been a secret.

00:08:59.372 --> 00:08:59.906
Heh!

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.475
It's required
of all evil geniuses to be smart

00:09:02.575 --> 00:09:03.710
as well as sneaky.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:05.945
Let's get started, Doctor.

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:08.615
I cannot wait to see
the look on Sonic's face

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:12.952
when he sees the powerful new
Decoe Bocoe XL Super Ultra.

00:09:13.086 --> 00:09:14.054
Just a minute!

00:09:14.154 --> 00:09:15.155
Heh?

00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:17.791
Hold your horses,
you dome-headed donkey!

00:09:17.924 --> 00:09:20.193
Who gave you permission
to name anything around here?

00:09:20.326 --> 00:09:22.495
I'm the boss.
I'll do the naming!

00:09:22.595 --> 00:09:25.698
You mean you've already
named the three components?

00:09:25.799 --> 00:09:27.000
DR. EGGMAN:
But of course.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:31.104
There's Decoe 2, Bocoe 2,
and, best of all,

00:09:31.204 --> 00:09:35.141
the XL Super Ultra
Eggman Extreme.

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:37.477
- I do not like those names.
- Neither do I.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:39.646
Why do our sections
get boring names,

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:41.981
and your section
gets a big long fancy one

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:45.018
with cool words
like Super Ultra Extreme?

00:09:45.118 --> 00:09:46.486
What is the deal with that?

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:49.589
We should be able
to name our own sections.

00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:51.157
Well, excuse me.

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:54.160
I thought I was doing you
a favor by naming them for you.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.796
Well, maybe you should've
asked us first.

00:09:56.896 --> 00:09:59.632
All right, all right.
Don't get snippy.

00:09:59.732 --> 00:10:02.502
I've written some second
and third choices in here.

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:04.771
What about Ace Jack King?

00:10:04.871 --> 00:10:06.840
Nope.
I don't even play cards.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.575
Rock Paper Scissors?

00:10:08.675 --> 00:10:09.876
You can't be serious.

00:10:09.976 --> 00:10:12.946
Eeny Meeny Meinie?
X Y Z?

00:10:13.046 --> 00:10:15.448
How does Egg,
Egger, and Eggiest grab you?

00:10:15.548 --> 00:10:16.716
I think that could work.

00:10:16.816 --> 00:10:18.885
CHRIS: As time went by,
we learned more and more

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:21.588
about relaxing and enjoying life
from our new friends.

00:10:21.688 --> 00:10:23.990
Soon, everyone
was having a good time.

00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:28.461
Everyone except Sonic, who still
hadn't gotten used to the idea.

00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:30.864
So he started hatching
an escape plan.

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:33.333
And this is what happened.

00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:37.770
Why would I be worried
about the X Tornado?

00:10:37.871 --> 00:10:38.838
You see?

00:10:38.938 --> 00:10:41.341
We've been on this boat
for a couple of days, right?

00:10:41.441 --> 00:10:42.675
Uh-huh.

00:10:42.775 --> 00:10:46.079
Well, Tails, did you ever think
that just maybe,

00:10:46.179 --> 00:10:48.314
machines can get Ionely?

00:10:48.414 --> 00:10:53.820
I bet the X Tornado's been awful
Ionesome since you went away.

00:10:53.953 --> 00:10:55.421
Oh, no!

00:10:55.555 --> 00:10:57.524
I never even thought of that.

00:10:57.624 --> 00:10:59.292
I feel so guilty.

00:10:59.425 --> 00:11:02.095
How could I abandon you
like that?

00:11:02.195 --> 00:11:04.364
Poor little X Tornado.

00:11:04.464 --> 00:11:06.799
I got him.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.569
Do you really mean that, Sonic?

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:11.571
Well, sure I mean it, Amy.

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:15.308
I think you're just about
the cutest thing I've ever seen.

00:11:15.408 --> 00:11:18.111
The way you swing that
little hammer of yours around,

00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:20.313
my heart beats
a million times a minute.

00:11:20.413 --> 00:11:23.983
I know, you could never care
for somebody like me.

00:11:24.083 --> 00:11:26.319
I guess that's just the way
it has to be.

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:28.388
Perhaps I could go on,

00:11:28.488 --> 00:11:31.191
if you would only
swing that hammer once more.

00:11:31.324 --> 00:11:34.093
You want it, you got it!

00:11:34.928 --> 00:11:35.929
Aah!

00:11:36.062 --> 00:11:37.530
Amy's gone berserk!

00:11:37.664 --> 00:11:38.831
Uh-huh.

00:11:38.932 --> 00:11:41.167
This boat's gonna drive
everybody bananas

00:11:41.267 --> 00:11:42.502
sooner or later.

00:11:42.602 --> 00:11:44.037
What do you think, Grandpa?

00:11:44.137 --> 00:11:46.906
Maybe we should ask the captain
if we can turn the ship around.

00:11:47.006 --> 00:11:48.208
I don't know.

00:11:48.308 --> 00:11:50.910
I have a feeling
something fishy's going on.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:54.147
CREAM: Did he really,
truly say that, Amy?

00:11:54.247 --> 00:11:56.015
AMY:
It's the truth, Cream.

00:11:56.115 --> 00:11:57.917
He said his little heart
beat faster

00:11:58.017 --> 00:11:59.919
every time I swung my hammer.

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:03.289
- He's so dreamy.
- Wow, that's so sweet.

00:12:03.423 --> 00:12:05.491
I have a feeling one day soon,

00:12:05.625 --> 00:12:07.560
Sonic's gonna ask me
to be his girl.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.962
- Really?
- Chao!

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:11.497
CHRIS:
Sonic!

00:12:16.169 --> 00:12:19.105
Hey!
Long time no see!

00:12:19.205 --> 00:12:20.440
Did you miss me?

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.243
No big important message
this time.

00:12:23.343 --> 00:12:25.445
Just dropping by to say hi.

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:27.247
Hey, you guys.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.149
Where is everybody?

00:12:33.386 --> 00:12:35.655
Hello?
Anybody?

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:36.990
Hello?

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:42.762
Guess there's nobody home.

00:12:42.862 --> 00:12:44.497
[Sobbing]

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:45.498
Huh?

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:48.034
Well, look who we have here.

00:12:48.134 --> 00:12:50.336
Our little flying robot friend.

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:52.572
You've come
to start trouble today?

00:12:52.672 --> 00:12:55.508
Well, too bad for you,
'cause nobody here now,

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.977
so you can just scram,
you hear me?

00:12:58.077 --> 00:12:59.445
[Laughs]

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:03.516
What's the matter now?

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:05.184
[Crying]

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:07.487
I'm so Ionesome!
Nobody's home.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.790
I just wanted somebody
to play with.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.492
[Crying]

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:13.993
It's all right.

00:13:14.093 --> 00:13:17.263
There, there, now,
don't cry, sweetheart.

00:13:17.363 --> 00:13:19.465
I'm so Ionely.

00:13:19.565 --> 00:13:21.601
Don't be Ionely.

00:13:21.701 --> 00:13:22.969
Ella's here now.

00:13:23.069 --> 00:13:24.370
You stay here.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.339
I'll make you
a nice lunch, okay?

00:13:26.439 --> 00:13:28.274
Don't you worry now.

00:13:28.374 --> 00:13:29.742
Ella?

00:13:29.842 --> 00:13:33.346
I'm sorry
for all those times I was bad.

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:35.648
- Will you forgive me?
- Of course.

00:13:35.782 --> 00:13:37.784
- This is for you.
- For me?

00:13:37.884 --> 00:13:39.052
[Explosion]

00:13:39.185 --> 00:13:40.586
Aah!

00:13:40.687 --> 00:13:43.122
[Laughing]

00:13:44.724 --> 00:13:46.025
Hey, look, Tails.

00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:48.961
An iceberg!
We're near the glaciers.

00:13:49.062 --> 00:13:51.297
Put this on.
It's a bit chilly out here.

00:13:51.397 --> 00:13:53.099
Hey, thanks, Grandpa.

00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:55.968
Guess Amy's still pretty upset
with Sonic, huh?

00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:58.204
Yes, well, it wasn't
very nice of him

00:13:58.304 --> 00:13:59.839
to lie to her like that.

00:13:59.939 --> 00:14:01.708
But Amy can't stay mad forever.

00:14:01.808 --> 00:14:02.942
AMY:
Sonic.

00:14:03.042 --> 00:14:05.611
Come on, you can't
stay up there all day.

00:14:05.712 --> 00:14:07.680
Don't you want to see
all the wonderful things

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.182
I can do with this hammer?

00:14:09.282 --> 00:14:10.783
It's pretty amazing, Sonic,

00:14:10.883 --> 00:14:13.686
but you've gotta see
it up real close, got it?

00:14:13.786 --> 00:14:14.721
SONIC:
No, thanks.

00:14:14.821 --> 00:14:16.723
I'll just stay up here,
catch some rays.

00:14:16.823 --> 00:14:18.691
- Maybe another time.
- That's it!

00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:20.893
You come down off that pole
this instant!

00:14:20.993 --> 00:14:23.563
CREAM: I don't like it
when Amy gets mad.

00:14:23.663 --> 00:14:26.265
I get the feeling we ought
to stay out of this.

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:27.266
I agree.

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:28.301
Oh.

00:14:31.604 --> 00:14:33.539
- Look at that!
- Wow!

00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:35.475
It's a whale!

00:14:35.575 --> 00:14:36.876
Another one!

00:14:36.976 --> 00:14:39.879
Wow, look how big it is!

00:14:39.979 --> 00:14:41.848
That's not a whale.

00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:43.149
I guess not.

00:14:43.282 --> 00:14:45.118
If not, what is it?

00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:47.086
DR. EGGMAN: Thought
you could take a pleasure cruise

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.321
without me, eh?

00:14:48.454 --> 00:14:50.490
Well, think again!

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:52.425
Aah!

00:14:52.525 --> 00:14:53.926
Let's go get them.

00:14:54.026 --> 00:14:56.429
We can beat that
overgrown tugboat any day.

00:14:56.529 --> 00:14:57.730
[Chuckles]

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:59.532
I was wondering how long
it would take

00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:01.567
before you bozos showed up.

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:03.403
You two boys
starting to rust yet?

00:15:03.503 --> 00:15:05.905
We are incapable of corrosion.

00:15:06.005 --> 00:15:09.575
You, on the other hand,
are a rotten little hedgehog.

00:15:09.675 --> 00:15:11.778
Stop all this yammering at once!

00:15:11.878 --> 00:15:14.914
You two tinheads are forgetting
who's in charge here!

00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:16.916
I hope you've
enjoyed yourself, Sonic,

00:15:17.049 --> 00:15:19.886
because your happy
little holiday's about to end.

00:15:19.986 --> 00:15:22.688
SONIC: Oh, yeah, I'd say
the fun's about to start.

00:15:22.822 --> 00:15:24.457
Don't be so sure, warthog.

00:15:24.557 --> 00:15:26.692
MAN: Captain, we've reached
the glaciers, sir.

00:15:26.826 --> 00:15:27.894
CAPTAIN:
Wonderful.

00:15:28.027 --> 00:15:30.463
Let's stop here so our
passengers can get a good look.

00:15:30.563 --> 00:15:32.899
Hey, why did he stop the ship?

00:15:32.999 --> 00:15:34.333
What's going on here?

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:36.202
It's the glacier, Mr. Thorndyke.

00:15:36.302 --> 00:15:38.037
Sure is a beauty, isn't it, sir?

00:15:38.137 --> 00:15:39.939
We can stay here
long as you like.

00:15:40.039 --> 00:15:41.174
- Aah!
- Aah!

00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:42.308
Are you crazy?

00:15:42.408 --> 00:15:44.877
This is no time
to look at a glacier!

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.883
Okay, if you want a fight,
you got a fight.

00:15:50.983 --> 00:15:52.385
Bring it on, Egghead!

00:15:52.518 --> 00:15:54.687
All in good time, my friend.

00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:57.290
First, let's mix things up
a bit, shall we?

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.225
Perhaps you seafaring simpletons

00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:01.961
would like to see
what my new Egg Fort 2 can do.

00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:04.297
Get ready to be blown away.

00:16:04.397 --> 00:16:07.533
All right, Egg Fort 2, combine.

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:09.435
- One...
- BOCOE: Two...

00:16:09.535 --> 00:16:10.937
DECOE:
Three!

00:16:11.037 --> 00:16:13.406
ALL:
Egg Fort 2 complete.

00:16:13.506 --> 00:16:14.874
[Laughs]

00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:16.375
Impressive, eh?

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:18.344
[Telephone rings]

00:16:18.444 --> 00:16:19.912
Hello?

00:16:20.012 --> 00:16:21.914
No, I'm not going
to change names!

00:16:22.014 --> 00:16:23.216
[Telephone rings]

00:16:23.349 --> 00:16:25.985
How dare you say my Egg Fort 2
isn't all that!

00:16:26.118 --> 00:16:27.286
[Grunts]

00:16:27.386 --> 00:16:29.322
I'm getting an unlisted number.

00:16:29.422 --> 00:16:32.325
Come on, try and catch me!
What are you waiting for?

00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:33.759
DR. EGGMAN:
Oh, Sonic?

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.061
Yeah, what?

00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:37.063
You're going nowhere fast.

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:38.164
Huh?

00:16:38.264 --> 00:16:40.199
Oh, no!

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:41.334
Aah!

00:16:41.434 --> 00:16:42.535
Oh, watch out!

00:16:42.635 --> 00:16:44.203
[Laughs evilly]

00:16:44.303 --> 00:16:46.539
This much fun should be illegal.

00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:47.974
Be careful!

00:16:48.074 --> 00:16:49.842
Don't worry!
We'll get help!

00:16:49.942 --> 00:16:51.844
OLD WOMAN ON LOUDSPEAKER:
Oh, poor little thing.

00:16:51.944 --> 00:16:53.312
You're having a tough time.

00:16:53.412 --> 00:16:54.914
I may be an old-timer,

00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:58.017
but I just might be able
to help you out.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:02.688
Now, Sonic, I want you
to breathe deeply and relax.

00:17:08.149 --> 00:17:09.784
OLD WOMAN ON LOUDSPEAKER:
Focus on your goal.

00:17:09.884 --> 00:17:11.186
Relax.

00:17:11.286 --> 00:17:14.889
Stay in the moment,
and feel the ice with your feet.

00:17:14.989 --> 00:17:17.092
Aah.

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:20.495
Not bad.

00:17:20.595 --> 00:17:22.731
Now, if I can only keep
my feet from slipping,

00:17:22.831 --> 00:17:24.499
this ought to be
a piece of cake.

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:26.134
Something's the matter.

00:17:26.267 --> 00:17:27.469
Why isn't he frightened?

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:28.770
I don't like it.

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:30.772
A moment ago,
we had him on the run.

00:17:30.872 --> 00:17:33.775
He certainly is cool
all of a sudden, isn't he?

00:17:33.875 --> 00:17:34.809
Enough of this!

00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:36.911
Let's put the freeze
on that hedgehog.

00:17:37.045 --> 00:17:37.946
MAN:
Captain!

00:17:38.046 --> 00:17:39.514
Aah!

00:17:40.315 --> 00:17:42.417
DR. EGGMAN:
What are you doing here?

00:17:42.517 --> 00:17:43.918
BOCOE:
He looks upset.

00:17:44.018 --> 00:17:45.854
Please, let me in!

00:17:45.954 --> 00:17:47.956
Why should we let you in?

00:17:48.556 --> 00:17:49.958
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:17:50.058 --> 00:17:51.726
CHRIS:
It's the X Tornado!

00:17:51.826 --> 00:17:53.428
AMY:
But who's flying it?

00:17:53.528 --> 00:17:56.164
I'll get you, you brat!

00:17:56.264 --> 00:17:57.532
It's Ella!

00:17:57.632 --> 00:17:58.633
But how?

00:17:58.767 --> 00:18:01.002
How'd she learn to fly
the X Tornado?

00:18:01.102 --> 00:18:03.905
Ella can do anything
she puts her mind to.

00:18:04.038 --> 00:18:05.673
Except windows.

00:18:05.807 --> 00:18:07.408
Aah, aah!
Help me!

00:18:07.542 --> 00:18:09.444
DR. EGGMAN: What are you
bawling about, Bokkun?

00:18:09.544 --> 00:18:12.013
Now we change to X Cyclone.

00:18:12.147 --> 00:18:14.182
Transform!

00:18:14.649 --> 00:18:17.051
You'll see who's boss now!

00:18:17.152 --> 00:18:19.521
Cyclone kick!

00:18:20.388 --> 00:18:22.123
Aah!

00:18:22.223 --> 00:18:23.958
- Aah!
- Aah!

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.235
OLD WOMAN: So often
we rush though our lives

00:18:34.369 --> 00:18:37.672
from day to day, not seeing
what is really important.

00:18:37.772 --> 00:18:40.575
Just think of it.
The smell of the ocean.

00:18:40.675 --> 00:18:42.777
The rustling of leaves.

00:18:42.877 --> 00:18:45.213
Moments with family and friends.

00:18:45.313 --> 00:18:48.216
Sometimes just to sit and feel
the warmth of the sun.

00:18:48.316 --> 00:18:49.951
TAILS:
Sonic!

00:18:50.051 --> 00:18:52.420
The X Tornado's all set to go!

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.955
You still want to go
back to town?

00:18:54.055 --> 00:18:56.457
Ah, what's the rush?

00:18:56.558 --> 00:18:58.726
- Come on down here.
- Huh?

00:18:58.827 --> 00:19:00.128
I changed my mind.

00:19:00.228 --> 00:19:01.763
I think I'll take it easy.

00:19:01.863 --> 00:19:04.432
Just enjoy myself for a while.

00:19:04.532 --> 00:19:07.602
I think you've made
the right decision, Sonic.

00:19:07.702 --> 00:19:09.904
Remember,
there's always enough time

00:19:10.038 --> 00:19:12.874
to wile away the hours
and just be happy.

00:19:13.007 --> 00:19:17.478
Now, let's all relax
and enjoy ourselves.
