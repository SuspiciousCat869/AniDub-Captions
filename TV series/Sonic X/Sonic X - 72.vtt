WEBVTT

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:17.084
They're going to attack again.

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:19.019
They're aiming straight for us!

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.521
We have to work fast!

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:22.823
Chris, you and Sonic
disperse the missiles,

00:00:22.823 --> 00:00:24.191
then launch a counterattack.

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:25.392
Roger.

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:27.094
Cosmo, take over for me.

00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:28.061
Sure.

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.134
So what's goin' down, pal?

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.405
Okay, Sonic, here's the plan.

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:41.041
Looks like the Metarex are
about to launch another attack.

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.544
We've gotta try to fend them off
the best as we can, and then

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:45.479
give 'em a dose of
their own medicine.

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:46.647
Sounds good.

00:00:46.647 --> 00:00:49.683
We'll wipe out those
Meta-punks in no time, flat.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.162
I've got a bad feeling, Cosmo.

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:03.063
Me too.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.065
These Metarex attacks
just seem to get

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.934
more and more violent every time.

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:09.469
But it's more than that. I
just can't figure it out.

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:12.706
Take off.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:18.445
Hey, what was that?

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:20.914
I don't know. There's
nothing on the radar.

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:24.585
[Growling]

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:26.887
[Evil laughter]

00:01:26.887 --> 00:01:29.690
Your time is up, my friends.

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:32.459
Go, go, go, go, go

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:35.562
Gotta go fast

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:38.498
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:44.304
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:46.373
Got ourselves a situation

00:01:46.373 --> 00:01:48.408
Stuck in a new location

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:52.012
Without any explanation

00:01:52.012 --> 00:01:54.081
No talk of relaxation

00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:55.716
Don't, don't, don't

00:01:55.716 --> 00:01:57.517
Don't blink, don't think

00:01:57.517 --> 00:01:59.319
Just go, go, go, go

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:00.821
Go, go

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:06.360
Sonic is on the run

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.261
Sonic, he's number one

00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:11.999
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:15.669
-<i>Gotta go fast</i>
-<i>Sonic</i>

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:18.071
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:19.973
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:22.476
Sonic X

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:24.411
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.214
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:02:27.214 --> 00:02:28.248
Sonic X

00:02:32.984 --> 00:02:35.453
The Abyss is waiting for you.

00:02:35.453 --> 00:02:36.988
Oh, no!

00:02:36.988 --> 00:02:38.389
Not him again!

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:39.724
[Growling]

00:02:39.724 --> 00:02:41.392
Farewell.

00:02:41.392 --> 00:02:43.328
[Grunting]

00:02:54.172 --> 00:02:56.808
Pressure's dropping by the second.

00:03:25.703 --> 00:03:28.039
Well, this looks like
a real hot spot.

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:30.208
I feel sick to my tummy.

00:03:30.208 --> 00:03:31.142
[Groan] Chao chao!

00:03:31.142 --> 00:03:34.412
That crash disconnected
our energy servers.

00:03:34.412 --> 00:03:36.714
It looks like we're
stranded, you guys.

00:03:36.714 --> 00:03:37.949
ALL: Huh?

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:39.384
ALL: Aah!

00:03:39.384 --> 00:03:41.185
[Growling]

00:03:41.185 --> 00:03:44.856
[Evil laughter]

00:03:44.856 --> 00:03:46.924
I see we are together again.

00:03:46.924 --> 00:03:48.659
Prepare to meet your doom.

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:50.595
Prepare to perish.

00:03:50.595 --> 00:03:53.798
Prepare to succumb to the
evil that is Yellow Zelkova.

00:03:53.798 --> 00:03:56.367
Prepare to... prepare to...

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.471
Prepare to... battle?

00:04:00.471 --> 00:04:03.541
I don't know. "Battle" just
seems kind of weak, doesn't it?

00:04:03.541 --> 00:04:05.143
Ooh! Enough!

00:04:05.143 --> 00:04:06.878
This is no guessing game.

00:04:06.878 --> 00:04:09.147
This is the moment of your demise.

00:04:09.147 --> 00:04:11.149
ALL: Aah!

00:04:11.783 --> 00:04:13.584
Where is the hedgehog?

00:04:13.584 --> 00:04:15.052
Here I am!

00:04:18.923 --> 00:04:20.425
It's Sonic!

00:04:21.926 --> 00:04:22.894
Almost there.

00:04:22.894 --> 00:04:23.661
Ready?

00:04:23.661 --> 00:04:24.629
Ready.

00:04:27.498 --> 00:04:28.599
Huh!

00:04:30.935 --> 00:04:33.738
Illuma Shield.

00:04:38.042 --> 00:04:39.877
Sonic, what happened?

00:04:39.877 --> 00:04:41.112
I'm not sure.

00:04:42.847 --> 00:04:44.081
Aah!

00:04:44.081 --> 00:04:45.516
That's the same thing that happened

00:04:45.516 --> 00:04:47.518
when Eggman put up his Star Shield.

00:04:47.518 --> 00:04:49.520
Maybe it's made from
the same stuff.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.122
You are correct, little one.

00:04:51.122 --> 00:04:54.392
I, Yellow Zelkova, have been
fortunate enough to be equipped

00:04:54.392 --> 00:04:56.427
with one of the very
first of the brand new

00:04:56.427 --> 00:04:59.397
Dr. Eggman Illuma
Shield power packs.

00:04:59.397 --> 00:05:00.465
And that's not all.

00:05:00.465 --> 00:05:03.835
As a bonus, I received this
Eggman temporary tattoo.

00:05:03.835 --> 00:05:05.236
You geek!

00:05:05.236 --> 00:05:07.705
You have an Eggman tattoo?

00:05:07.705 --> 00:05:08.272
Loser!

00:05:08.272 --> 00:05:09.640
Don't, Amy. You'll make him angry.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.542
Cosmo's right. Settle down.

00:05:11.542 --> 00:05:13.277
I will not settle down!

00:05:13.277 --> 00:05:16.848
That big yellow hunk o' junk is
gonna be sorry he ever met me!

00:05:16.848 --> 00:05:18.349
Hunk of junk?

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:20.751
How dare you mock the
great Yellow Zelkova?

00:05:20.751 --> 00:05:22.186
I'll make you pay for that!

00:05:22.186 --> 00:05:23.454
Grrr!

00:05:23.454 --> 00:05:24.889
Well, we meet again.

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.792
Perhaps this time, I
will finish you off.

00:05:27.792 --> 00:05:29.927
[Both grunt]

00:05:29.927 --> 00:05:31.496
I'd like to see you try.

00:05:31.496 --> 00:05:33.331
[Grunting]

00:05:33.331 --> 00:05:34.465
Hmm?

00:05:34.465 --> 00:05:37.335
Oh, come on. You're tougher
than that, aren't you?

00:05:37.335 --> 00:05:40.438
Aren't you gonna use your
spankin' new shield on me?

00:05:40.438 --> 00:05:43.741
We might be able to knock
Zelkova out with a Ring Tunnel.

00:05:43.741 --> 00:05:46.110
Right now, anything's worth a try.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.678
Ring Tunnel!

00:05:48.746 --> 00:05:49.714
Let's go!

00:05:50.081 --> 00:05:51.048
Huh!

00:05:53.751 --> 00:05:55.453
[Evil laughter]

00:05:55.953 --> 00:05:57.221
Whoa!

00:05:57.221 --> 00:05:58.456
Aah!

00:05:58.456 --> 00:05:59.423
[All gasp]

00:06:00.391 --> 00:06:01.959
Huh!

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:03.694
Illuma Shock!

00:06:05.429 --> 00:06:06.964
Sonic!

00:06:06.964 --> 00:06:08.099
Oh, no!

00:06:08.633 --> 00:06:10.568
[Grunt] Oh, yeah?

00:06:10.568 --> 00:06:13.037
[Laughing] You
porcupine pip-squeak.

00:06:13.037 --> 00:06:14.338
You will never beat me.

00:06:14.338 --> 00:06:17.875
With my Illuma Shield power pack,
I am virtually unstoppable!

00:06:17.875 --> 00:06:19.810
You big wimp!

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.446
Gotta rely on some stupid shield.

00:06:22.446 --> 00:06:25.650
Too afraid to fight me with
your own two fists, huh?

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.919
You're nothin' but a big baby!

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:29.353
What did you say?

00:06:30.154 --> 00:06:32.590
We'll see if that
shield helps you now.

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.158
Get ready, pal.

00:06:48.606 --> 00:06:51.642
Shadow, what is this place?

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.578
[Grunt]

00:06:53.578 --> 00:07:14.198
[Grunting]

00:07:14.198 --> 00:07:16.567
I've heard of tree houses
before, but tree planets?
[Grunting]

00:07:16.567 --> 00:07:17.535
Never.

00:07:18.502 --> 00:07:20.838
Everything's so quiet here.

00:07:20.838 --> 00:07:23.074
I'd say "quiet" is
an understatement.

00:07:23.074 --> 00:07:25.142
More like creepy.

00:07:25.142 --> 00:07:27.078
I don't like it.

00:07:31.182 --> 00:07:32.583
Me neither.

00:07:32.583 --> 00:07:34.185
It's cold, too.

00:07:34.185 --> 00:07:35.653
Hm.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.695
What could that be?

00:07:45.396 --> 00:07:47.698
Don't know. Too
bright to be a star.

00:07:53.671 --> 00:07:56.173
Aaaaah! Uh!

00:07:57.642 --> 00:07:58.576
Huh!

00:07:58.576 --> 00:08:00.811
Oof.

00:08:00.811 --> 00:08:03.914
[Growling]

00:08:04.281 --> 00:08:06.450
[Groaning]

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.352
[Growling]

00:08:09.153 --> 00:08:10.154
Huh!

00:08:10.154 --> 00:08:11.422
[Grunting]

00:08:16.661 --> 00:08:17.895
[Both gasp]

00:08:17.895 --> 00:08:19.830
You foolish meddlers.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:24.101
Your missiles are mere play toys
compared to my awesome power.

00:08:24.101 --> 00:08:25.469
[Evil laughter]

00:08:25.469 --> 00:08:26.737
Oh, no!

00:08:26.737 --> 00:08:28.739
We have to keep trying, Cosmo.

00:08:28.739 --> 00:08:30.274
We'll get through.

00:08:30.274 --> 00:08:31.575
Yeah.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.250
In order to penetrate
a shield that powerful,

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:42.119
we're going to have to harness
a great deal of energy.

00:08:42.119 --> 00:08:45.890
Of course, I'm not sure where
we'll get the extra energy from.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.059
[Growling]

00:08:48.059 --> 00:08:49.460
Huh!

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.195
ALL: Knuckles, no!

00:08:51.195 --> 00:08:54.198
[Grunting]

00:08:55.166 --> 00:09:00.705
[Groaning]

00:09:00.705 --> 00:09:01.906
Hmm?

00:09:01.906 --> 00:09:03.641
You'd think with a fist like that,

00:09:03.641 --> 00:09:05.776
you could actually do some damage.

00:09:05.776 --> 00:09:08.012
You might wanna spend less
time on Illuma Shields

00:09:08.012 --> 00:09:10.481
and more on the old
upper body strength.

00:09:10.481 --> 00:09:14.452
I grow weary of your mocking,
you little red fool.

00:09:14.452 --> 00:09:16.854
Aaah!

00:09:16.854 --> 00:09:18.189
Take that!

00:09:18.189 --> 00:09:22.660
Whoaaa!

00:09:23.127 --> 00:09:24.161
Huh?

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:26.931
[Grunt]

00:09:26.931 --> 00:09:27.932
Oof.

00:09:28.532 --> 00:09:31.135
[Struggling]

00:09:37.007 --> 00:09:39.643
[Struggling]

00:09:48.385 --> 00:09:50.454
[Panting]

00:10:01.264 --> 00:10:02.232
[Evil laughter]

00:10:02.232 --> 00:10:05.102
Now you will all
meet your fiery end.

00:10:05.102 --> 00:10:07.070
[Grunt]

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.172
ALL: Aaah!

00:10:14.211 --> 00:10:16.413
[Grunt] Not so fast, yellowbelly.

00:10:17.013 --> 00:10:18.048
Huh!

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:21.551
[Groaning]

00:10:21.551 --> 00:10:22.953
You'll be okay.

00:10:22.953 --> 00:10:25.355
We gotta get down there fast.

00:10:25.355 --> 00:10:27.157
You're right. Hang on tight!

00:10:27.157 --> 00:10:28.725
I'm gonna show him what happens

00:10:28.725 --> 00:10:30.660
when he tries to hurt my friends.

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.295
Oh, no!

00:10:33.797 --> 00:10:35.132
Oh, yes.

00:10:35.132 --> 00:10:37.467
Another Metarex fleet.

00:10:37.467 --> 00:10:39.269
Persistent, aren't they?

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.442
That's my cue.

00:10:52.649 --> 00:10:55.685
[Lightning cracks]

00:11:09.266 --> 00:11:11.835
That was some light show!

00:11:11.835 --> 00:11:13.470
Yeah, I'll say.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:16.673
I can't believe how those lightening
bolts had such perfect aim.

00:11:18.675 --> 00:11:22.446
Grrrr!

00:11:22.446 --> 00:11:23.413
[Grunting]

00:11:23.413 --> 00:11:25.182
You are giving me a headache.

00:11:25.182 --> 00:11:26.750
Cease your pummeling!

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:29.920
[Grunting]

00:11:30.187 --> 00:11:31.455
Hmm?

00:11:32.088 --> 00:11:33.857
I'm not done. Huh!

00:11:33.857 --> 00:11:35.392
Grrrr!

00:11:35.392 --> 00:11:38.261
Ugh...

00:11:39.696 --> 00:11:41.865
[Chuckling]

00:11:43.166 --> 00:11:44.835
[Grunting]

00:11:44.835 --> 00:11:45.669
Hm?

00:11:45.669 --> 00:11:48.939
Uhhh!

00:11:48.939 --> 00:11:51.575
You are in for a shock,
my tiny friend.

00:11:51.575 --> 00:11:53.176
[Electricity crackles]

00:11:53.176 --> 00:11:56.079
Ha! Some shock!

00:11:56.079 --> 00:11:58.215
Is that all you got, pal?

00:11:58.215 --> 00:12:01.151
Aah!

00:12:01.651 --> 00:12:05.355
[Grunting]

00:12:05.355 --> 00:12:06.690
Aaah!

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:10.527
[Groaning]

00:12:12.262 --> 00:12:14.664
You think you're clever, don't you?

00:12:14.664 --> 00:12:15.999
[Grunt]

00:12:15.999 --> 00:12:20.103
What? You mean you haven't
figured that out already?

00:12:21.371 --> 00:12:22.606
It's Knuckles.

00:12:22.606 --> 00:12:24.040
He's still fighting him.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.143
Let's get out of here
while he's not looking.

00:12:27.544 --> 00:12:30.881
You cannot fool me!

00:12:30.881 --> 00:12:34.384
[Crackling]

00:12:37.053 --> 00:12:38.455
Aah!

00:12:38.455 --> 00:12:39.623
Uhh!

00:12:41.024 --> 00:12:42.959
I'll use Zelkova's
energy against him

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:44.895
to break through
that Illuma Shield.

00:12:44.895 --> 00:12:47.130
CHRIS: Blue Typhoon,
do you read me?

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:48.131
He's okay!

00:12:49.866 --> 00:12:51.101
ALL: All right!

00:12:52.035 --> 00:12:53.069
Huh!

00:12:53.703 --> 00:12:55.405
Hey, Sonic!

00:12:55.405 --> 00:12:57.908
Looks like Knuckles might
need some assistance.

00:12:57.908 --> 00:12:59.809
Let's you and me
go lend him a hand.

00:13:02.779 --> 00:13:04.247
What now?

00:13:04.247 --> 00:13:06.850
Will nothing deter
these puny meddlers?

00:13:07.517 --> 00:13:10.353
[Grunting]

00:13:10.353 --> 00:13:11.221
Huh!

00:13:11.221 --> 00:13:12.856
Hey, big guy!

00:13:12.856 --> 00:13:14.190
Up here!

00:13:14.558 --> 00:13:15.625
Huh!

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.763
You still have not learned,
have you, hedgehog?

00:13:19.763 --> 00:13:21.431
Illuma Shield!

00:13:21.431 --> 00:13:23.133
Whoaa!

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.035
I gotcha.

00:13:25.035 --> 00:13:26.269
Chao chao!

00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:33.510
Hm?

00:13:34.244 --> 00:13:35.478
Huh?

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:48.291
Okay.

00:13:48.858 --> 00:13:50.226
TAILS: Cosmo!

00:13:50.527 --> 00:13:52.162
Sonic!

00:13:53.563 --> 00:13:54.564
Huh!

00:13:58.234 --> 00:14:00.170
Here goes.

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:01.071
[Grunt]

00:14:03.106 --> 00:14:04.407
What is this?

00:14:04.407 --> 00:14:05.375
Hmm?

00:14:05.375 --> 00:14:07.310
What's going on here?

00:14:08.745 --> 00:14:11.381
Don't you worry your
little head, Zelkova.

00:14:11.381 --> 00:14:13.316
You just sit tight. Heh.

00:14:13.316 --> 00:14:15.986
[Grunt]

00:14:24.494 --> 00:14:26.329
[Lightning cracks]

00:14:28.031 --> 00:14:29.099
Huh!

00:14:31.401 --> 00:14:32.369
Hmm?

00:14:33.937 --> 00:14:38.174
Aaaaaah!

00:14:39.175 --> 00:14:46.116
[Screaming]

00:14:47.283 --> 00:14:48.518
Yeah!

00:14:51.588 --> 00:14:53.123
We did it, Sonic!

00:14:53.123 --> 00:14:54.424
Ha!

00:15:01.431 --> 00:15:02.499
[Panting]

00:15:02.499 --> 00:15:04.934
What... What is happening to me?

00:15:04.934 --> 00:15:09.305
[Groaning]

00:15:10.507 --> 00:15:14.411
Aaaaah!

00:15:15.378 --> 00:15:16.379
[All gasp]

00:15:17.647 --> 00:15:20.784
Aaaaah!

00:15:24.861 --> 00:15:29.733
[Growling]

00:15:33.003 --> 00:15:33.737
[Grunting]

00:15:33.737 --> 00:15:35.238
Arrrrrgh!

00:15:35.238 --> 00:15:36.473
Huh!!

00:15:36.473 --> 00:15:38.141
Grrr!

00:15:38.141 --> 00:15:39.976
Ughh.

00:15:41.445 --> 00:15:44.414
[Screaming]

00:15:44.414 --> 00:15:46.149
Huh!

00:15:46.149 --> 00:15:49.152
[Screaming]

00:15:49.152 --> 00:15:52.189
Dark Oak will be victorious!

00:15:52.189 --> 00:15:52.823
Huh!

00:15:52.823 --> 00:15:55.258
Aaah!

00:15:57.694 --> 00:16:00.397
He will have revenge!

00:16:06.937 --> 00:16:09.072
He thought he was indestructible.

00:16:16.646 --> 00:16:18.081
Interesting.

00:16:18.081 --> 00:16:20.116
After having researched their data,

00:16:20.116 --> 00:16:22.152
I have discovered
the Metarex plan to-

00:16:22.152 --> 00:16:24.287
Doctor.

00:16:24.287 --> 00:16:28.258
Dr. Eggman, is there something
I can help you with?

00:16:28.258 --> 00:16:30.093
Oh, not at all, my friend.

00:16:30.093 --> 00:16:33.096
I was just admiring your
up-to-the-minute gadgetry.

00:16:33.096 --> 00:16:36.600
I really must commend you on
your technological wherewithal.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.935
The doctor is taking
rather copious notes.

00:16:38.935 --> 00:16:42.272
Uh... so that he can
build one just like it.

00:16:42.839 --> 00:16:44.207
Hmm.

00:16:44.207 --> 00:16:46.776
Zelkova's been destroyed.

00:16:46.776 --> 00:16:48.011
What's that?

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:53.917
It seems your so-called Illuma Shield
was of no use to him in the end.

00:16:53.917 --> 00:16:56.419
Well, it didn't come
with a warranty.

00:16:56.419 --> 00:16:58.355
[Evil laughter]

00:17:02.025 --> 00:17:03.627
Hmm.

00:17:12.202 --> 00:17:16.573
[Grunting]

00:17:18.508 --> 00:17:20.410
That looks pretty interesting.

00:17:21.011 --> 00:17:23.313
Let's see here.

00:17:24.948 --> 00:17:26.283
[Gasp]

00:17:26.883 --> 00:17:29.786
I knew it. It's a fake.

00:17:29.786 --> 00:17:31.721
Why would there be
a fake Chaos Emerald

00:17:31.721 --> 00:17:33.423
in the middle of nowhere?

00:17:33.423 --> 00:17:34.891
How weird.

00:17:40.196 --> 00:17:41.264
[Groaning]

00:17:41.264 --> 00:17:42.732
Huh?

00:17:43.233 --> 00:17:45.702
[Grunting]

00:17:47.437 --> 00:17:48.471
Huh.

00:17:49.072 --> 00:17:51.441
[Gasp] What?

00:17:51.441 --> 00:17:53.343
[Groan]

00:17:53.343 --> 00:17:57.147
Shadow, it's that Leon
guy from the resistance.

00:17:59.482 --> 00:18:01.418
Tell us what happened.

00:18:02.385 --> 00:18:04.187
Metarex...

00:18:04.187 --> 00:18:06.256
They fooled us all.

00:18:06.256 --> 00:18:09.059
They told us we could
be one of them.

00:18:09.059 --> 00:18:10.827
But they lied.

00:18:10.827 --> 00:18:13.263
[Groan] Destroying us all...

00:18:13.263 --> 00:18:14.998
Already happening...

00:18:14.998 --> 00:18:16.499
[Groaning]

00:18:16.499 --> 00:18:18.034
Shadow...

00:18:18.034 --> 00:18:19.603
Hm...

00:18:19.603 --> 00:18:21.538
My pocket...

00:18:21.538 --> 00:18:23.607
Look inside...

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:28.011
What is it?

00:18:29.045 --> 00:18:30.513
You must stop them.

00:18:30.513 --> 00:18:33.416
It's... not too late

00:18:33.416 --> 00:18:35.552
[Grimace]
