WEBVTT

00:00:05.023 --> 00:00:07.659
We are grateful for your heroism.

00:00:07.659 --> 00:00:10.462
You saved our Planet
Egg and our planet!

00:00:11.396 --> 00:00:15.634
We shall do our best to bestow upon
you the thanks that you deserve

00:00:15.634 --> 00:00:18.470
by holding a festival
today in your honor—

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.607
a parade, music, dancing, and
a feast, to show our thanks.

00:00:22.607 --> 00:00:23.742
[Whistles]

00:00:23.742 --> 00:00:25.310
Sounds good to me.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.079
Me, too, especially the feast part.

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:29.948
Sounds like fun, Tails.

00:00:29.948 --> 00:00:31.883
I'm not so sure I'm
gonna like this.

00:00:31.883 --> 00:00:32.851
Aah!

00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:41.760
[Crowds cheering]

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.395
They go all out!

00:00:43.395 --> 00:00:44.195
Yeah.

00:00:44.195 --> 00:00:45.397
[Laughing]

00:00:45.397 --> 00:00:46.531
Aah!

00:00:46.531 --> 00:00:47.165
Huh?

00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:49.401
One, two, three...!

00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:50.669
Aaaah!

00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:52.037
That's it!

00:00:52.037 --> 00:00:54.239
Now everybody!

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.976
Whoa!

00:00:57.976 --> 00:00:58.944
Ah!

00:00:58.944 --> 00:01:01.279
[Excited crowd commotion]
Ah! I just can't get enough!

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:02.914
Why are they throwing us?

00:01:02.914 --> 00:01:04.482
Don't know!

00:01:04.482 --> 00:01:06.851
Haha! This is how we honor heroes!

00:01:06.851 --> 00:01:08.753
[Crowd yelling in excitement]

00:01:08.753 --> 00:01:09.921
There they are!

00:01:10.555 --> 00:01:11.890
Look what I have!

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:12.557
Huh?

00:01:12.557 --> 00:01:14.192
A Chaos Emerald.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.661
Who found it?

00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:18.129
I did.

00:01:18.129 --> 00:01:21.132
'Cause I wasn't too busy
partying with the locals.

00:01:21.132 --> 00:01:23.001
Wow! That looks like fun!

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:24.202
Chao chao!

00:01:24.202 --> 00:01:26.004
Yeah, if you want to
feel like a yo-yo.

00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:28.006
Why are they bouncing
you like that?

00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:31.409
It's for getting their
Planet Egg back.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.045
It's a token of their appreciation.

00:01:34.045 --> 00:01:36.948
I'm appreciated enough!

00:01:36.948 --> 00:01:38.783
I can't take much more.

00:01:38.783 --> 00:01:40.719
This is so wonderful.

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.954
I can't believe we
already found one.

00:01:42.954 --> 00:01:46.491
This means we only have six more
to find, doesn't it, Cosmo?

00:01:46.491 --> 00:01:48.693
You down there, friends
of the heroes!

00:01:48.693 --> 00:01:50.595
Let us honor you, too!

00:01:50.595 --> 00:01:52.430
Throw them here!

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.332
Whoa!

00:01:54.332 --> 00:01:57.702
Come defy the forces of gravity!

00:01:58.136 --> 00:02:00.305
I'm actually a big fan of gravity.

00:02:00.305 --> 00:02:02.807
[Laughter and crowd commotion]

00:02:07.212 --> 00:02:08.813
Go, go, go, go, go

00:02:08.813 --> 00:02:11.916
Gotta go fast

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.819
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:02:17.088 --> 00:02:20.659
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:22.694
Got ourselves a situation

00:02:22.694 --> 00:02:24.763
Stuck in a new location

00:02:24.763 --> 00:02:28.366
Without any explanation

00:02:28.366 --> 00:02:30.435
No talk of relaxation

00:02:30.435 --> 00:02:32.070
Don't, don't, don't

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.872
Don't blink, don't think

00:02:33.872 --> 00:02:35.674
Just go, go, go, go

00:02:35.674 --> 00:02:37.175
Go, go

00:02:40.845 --> 00:02:42.714
Sonic is on the run

00:02:42.714 --> 00:02:44.616
Sonic, he's number one

00:02:44.616 --> 00:02:48.286
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:02:48.286 --> 00:02:51.990
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.392
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:02:54.392 --> 00:02:56.294
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:02:56.294 --> 00:02:58.830
Sonic X

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.765
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:03.568
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:03:03.568 --> 00:03:04.602
Sonic X

00:03:11.963 --> 00:03:13.365
[Evil laughter]

00:03:13.365 --> 00:03:16.968
So nice of Sonic and his friends
to find the Chaos Emerald for me.

00:03:16.968 --> 00:03:18.270
Let's see...

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.839
what sort of strategic strategy
should I come up with

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:22.574
to get it from them?

00:03:22.574 --> 00:03:24.709
Hmm. Hmm.

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.778
Aren't all strategies strategic?

00:03:26.778 --> 00:03:28.380
Not Dr. Eggman's.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.616
His strategies lack strategy
the way his tactics lack tact.

00:03:31.616 --> 00:03:33.184
And his thinking lacks thought.

00:03:33.184 --> 00:03:35.220
Since the three of you
are so brilliant,

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.988
why don't you come up with a plan?

00:03:36.988 --> 00:03:37.622
ALL: Huh?

00:03:37.622 --> 00:03:40.225
But whatever you do,
do not disappoint me.

00:03:41.893 --> 00:03:45.330
Ahhh... ah... I've got a
headache all of a sudden!

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.264
Me too.

00:03:46.264 --> 00:03:48.800
I can't concentrate right
now. It's unbearable!

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.303
I think I need to lie
down for a while.

00:03:51.303 --> 00:03:52.671
Aww. You have headaches?

00:03:52.671 --> 00:03:55.173
Guess the doctor's going
to have to operate.

00:03:55.173 --> 00:03:56.441
Aah!

00:03:56.441 --> 00:03:57.309
[Chuckling]

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.577
DR. EGGMAN: Get back here!

00:04:01.246 --> 00:04:04.516
I'm gonna go check on
the, uh... the thing!

00:04:08.386 --> 00:04:11.156
Whew! I got away before
he could grab me.

00:04:11.156 --> 00:04:13.024
Whoa! Ah! Huh?

00:04:13.558 --> 00:04:14.559
Rouge!

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:18.797
Hi, there. I just dropped by to
ask if you'd do me a little favor.

00:04:18.797 --> 00:04:22.367
I'd have to be totally batty
to do any favors for you!

00:04:22.367 --> 00:04:24.936
Ha! Just wait 'til I tell
Dr. Eggman you're—

00:04:24.936 --> 00:04:26.404
Really?

00:04:26.404 --> 00:04:28.306
You don't want to do that, do you?

00:04:28.306 --> 00:04:30.208
Your little secret might get out.

00:04:30.208 --> 00:04:32.577
I don't know what
you're talking about!

00:04:32.577 --> 00:04:33.878
Oh, no?

00:04:33.878 --> 00:04:36.481
Does this look familiar?

00:04:36.481 --> 00:04:37.816
Hmmmmm.

00:04:37.816 --> 00:04:39.484
Yeah. It's mine.

00:04:39.985 --> 00:04:41.553
Ah!

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.889
I checked out the picture inside.

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:46.191
She's so pretty.

00:04:46.191 --> 00:04:47.158
Aaah!

00:04:47.158 --> 00:04:48.893
Please don't say anything!

00:04:48.893 --> 00:04:51.496
I'll do whatever you want
me to do, I promise!

00:04:51.496 --> 00:04:54.032
Just please don't
tell anybody, please!

00:04:54.032 --> 00:04:56.501
[Chuckle] Good boy.

00:04:58.536 --> 00:05:00.905
[Growling]

00:05:00.905 --> 00:05:01.873
Please, doctor!

00:05:01.873 --> 00:05:03.775
You worthless metal moochers!

00:05:03.775 --> 00:05:05.276
[Panting, yelling]

00:05:05.276 --> 00:05:06.678
I hate to do this.

00:05:06.678 --> 00:05:08.380
Hey, Dr. Eggman!

00:05:09.347 --> 00:05:10.382
Yes?

00:05:10.382 --> 00:05:12.584
I just got an idea!

00:05:12.584 --> 00:05:13.284
Hmm?

00:05:13.284 --> 00:05:14.586
[Whispering]

00:05:14.586 --> 00:05:15.587
Eh?

00:05:15.587 --> 00:05:16.454
Huh?

00:05:16.454 --> 00:05:18.123
[Conniving laughter]

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.091
Egg-cellent!

00:05:20.091 --> 00:05:23.661
One of the most brilliant
plans I've ever come up with!

00:05:23.661 --> 00:05:25.530
Except that I came up with it.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.199
Are you contradicting me, Bokkun?

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:29.534
We're off the hook.

00:05:29.534 --> 00:05:31.536
I never thought I would be
glad that Bokkun's around.

00:05:31.536 --> 00:05:32.971
But it was my plan!

00:05:32.971 --> 00:05:34.406
And now it's mine.

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:36.107
Ahh.

00:05:40.178 --> 00:05:41.913
I don't care if it's
an honor or not.

00:05:41.913 --> 00:05:43.848
Nobody tosses me around.

00:05:45.417 --> 00:05:46.918
That looks like...

00:05:49.921 --> 00:05:50.989
Eggman!

00:05:50.989 --> 00:05:52.090
[Coughs]

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.659
Knuckles, it's you!
What good fortune!

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:55.693
Heh!

00:05:55.693 --> 00:05:58.396
Finally someone who can
help me! [Chuckling]

00:05:58.396 --> 00:06:00.532
Help you? Not a chance.

00:06:00.532 --> 00:06:03.435
Oh, Knuckles, please,
you have to hear me out.

00:06:03.435 --> 00:06:07.205
My ship ran out of power and
crashed on this desolate planet.

00:06:07.205 --> 00:06:09.007
If I don't find a way to leave,

00:06:09.007 --> 00:06:11.609
I'll be trapped here
the rest of my life!

00:06:11.609 --> 00:06:13.478
[Mock crying] It's my fault.

00:06:13.478 --> 00:06:16.881
I—I'm getting what I deserve.

00:06:16.881 --> 00:06:18.216
Come on. Cool it.

00:06:18.216 --> 00:06:19.784
Don't be so hard on yourself.

00:06:19.784 --> 00:06:24.889
[Crying] I just got so carried away
with wanting to take over the universe.

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:27.859
I was evil and greedy.

00:06:27.859 --> 00:06:28.993
It's true.

00:06:28.993 --> 00:06:32.464
I wanted planets and entire
galaxies all to myself.

00:06:32.464 --> 00:06:33.665
But if I get off this rock,

00:06:33.665 --> 00:06:36.134
I'll never turn a moon
into a devastating weapon,

00:06:36.134 --> 00:06:39.170
or block out a planet's
sun again, I swear.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.340
If only I had a Chaos
Emerald for my ship.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.077
I could leave here and start
my new life as a good person.

00:06:46.478 --> 00:06:48.012
Huh?

00:06:50.915 --> 00:06:52.083
[Evil chuckle]

00:06:58.089 --> 00:06:59.090
ALL: Aah!

00:06:59.591 --> 00:07:02.861
You want us to let Dr. Eggman
use the Chaos Emerald?

00:07:02.861 --> 00:07:03.795
Mm-hmm.

00:07:03.795 --> 00:07:07.365
He promised to abandon his
evil ways if we help him out.

00:07:07.365 --> 00:07:08.600
[Sigh]

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.001
Hm.

00:07:10.001 --> 00:07:11.503
We've heard that before.

00:07:11.503 --> 00:07:13.204
Tails is right, Knuckles.

00:07:13.204 --> 00:07:13.938
Hm.

00:07:13.938 --> 00:07:17.242
Dr. Eggman is always saying
he'll abandon his evil ways,

00:07:17.242 --> 00:07:18.309
but he never does.

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:20.011
And yet every time,

00:07:20.011 --> 00:07:22.347
he somehow gets you to believe him.

00:07:22.347 --> 00:07:23.982
Grrr!

00:07:23.982 --> 00:07:26.284
Well, I wasn't asking
your permission!

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:29.754
I'm the one who
found this Emerald,

00:07:29.754 --> 00:07:31.389
so I'll do what I want with it.

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:32.590
Ah!

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:33.591
[Sigh]

00:07:34.692 --> 00:07:36.594
I can't let you do this, Knuckles.

00:07:36.594 --> 00:07:38.563
You're gonna have to
fight me to stop me.

00:07:38.963 --> 00:07:40.798
Yeah, I know.

00:07:41.299 --> 00:07:43.034
If that's the way you want it.

00:07:43.034 --> 00:07:45.403
Sonic! Knuckles! What
are you two doing?

00:07:48.173 --> 00:07:49.140
Ready?

00:07:49.374 --> 00:07:50.508
Ready!

00:07:50.508 --> 00:07:51.643
[Both yelling]

00:07:52.343 --> 00:07:54.546
They're fighting.

00:07:55.146 --> 00:08:09.494
[Sounds of fighting]

00:08:09.494 --> 00:08:12.397
We've got to do something
to stop this fighting.

00:08:12.397 --> 00:08:16.134
Hey, do these boots make
my legs look too skinny?

00:08:16.134 --> 00:08:17.535
They look just fine, Amy.

00:08:17.535 --> 00:08:19.037
Chao chao! Chao chao!

00:08:19.037 --> 00:08:21.940
You want to go take the
X Tornado for a spin?

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.041
Sure, why not?

00:08:23.041 --> 00:08:24.475
Excuse me.

00:08:24.475 --> 00:08:26.444
Shouldn't we stop
Knuckles and Sonic?

00:08:26.444 --> 00:08:27.812
Eh, nah.

00:08:27.812 --> 00:08:29.547
This is how they work
their problems out.

00:08:29.547 --> 00:08:31.449
Yeah, they do this all the time.

00:08:32.417 --> 00:08:35.353
They'll just fight until
they get tired of fighting.

00:08:35.353 --> 00:08:36.588
It isn't a big deal.

00:08:36.588 --> 00:08:37.889
Chao chao chao!

00:08:37.889 --> 00:08:41.292
I just don't understand
these creatures.

00:08:41.292 --> 00:08:43.661
Ah! Wha—?

00:08:44.796 --> 00:08:47.599
Ah!

00:08:47.599 --> 00:08:49.367
I can't take it anymore!

00:08:50.201 --> 00:08:51.869
Please stop it!

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:53.438
Aah!

00:08:53.438 --> 00:08:55.173
This isn't right!

00:08:55.573 --> 00:08:59.043
Hey Cosmo, I wouldn't get
too close if I were you.

00:08:59.043 --> 00:09:02.080
Hyah! Huh!

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.381
Yaa!

00:09:03.381 --> 00:09:04.415
Ha!

00:09:04.415 --> 00:09:05.717
[Sounds of fighting]

00:09:05.717 --> 00:09:08.886
Heh, heh. My plan worked perfectly!

00:09:08.886 --> 00:09:11.789
They've left the Chaos
Emerald unguarded.

00:09:12.924 --> 00:09:14.092
[Evil chuckle]

00:09:14.092 --> 00:09:16.327
No one will even know I was here.

00:09:16.327 --> 00:09:18.196
Hi, Dr. Eggman!

00:09:18.196 --> 00:09:22.066
Maybe if I ignore
him, he'll disapp—

00:09:22.066 --> 00:09:23.301
You forgot your lunch!

00:09:23.301 --> 00:09:24.702
Aah!

00:09:24.702 --> 00:09:26.638
If you want to conquer
the universe,

00:09:26.638 --> 00:09:28.439
you've got to stay
healthy, you know!

00:09:28.439 --> 00:09:30.642
Quiet, or they'll discover me!

00:09:31.342 --> 00:09:32.877
Sorry about that.

00:09:32.877 --> 00:09:33.778
[Nervous laughter]

00:09:33.778 --> 00:09:36.047
Go to the ship, and
don't come back!

00:09:36.047 --> 00:09:38.116
I won't, Dr. Eggman!

00:09:38.116 --> 00:09:39.017
Shh!

00:09:41.919 --> 00:09:43.388
[Laughing]

00:09:43.388 --> 00:09:45.923
That kid's gonna be real useful.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.683
At last, a Chaos Emerald.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.586
Nothing can stop me now.

00:09:56.586 --> 00:09:58.154
Aah!

00:09:58.688 --> 00:10:01.057
That's what you think,
but you're wrong.

00:10:01.057 --> 00:10:03.659
I...can...explain!

00:10:03.659 --> 00:10:06.529
Aah! Watch where you
swing that thing!

00:10:08.698 --> 00:10:12.969
Heh. How wonderful to see
you all again. [Chuckle]

00:10:12.969 --> 00:10:13.803
Aah!

00:10:14.771 --> 00:10:15.671
[Both grunt]

00:10:15.671 --> 00:10:16.639
[Grunting]

00:10:16.639 --> 00:10:19.542
I had a pretty good feeling
we'd be seeing his ugly mug.

00:10:19.542 --> 00:10:20.777
Huh?

00:10:22.311 --> 00:10:25.114
Eggman, what are you doing here?

00:10:25.114 --> 00:10:26.816
You mean me?

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:31.487
Uhhhh. I was just about to
consume this delicious banana.

00:10:31.487 --> 00:10:33.089
[Gobbling] Tasty!

00:10:33.089 --> 00:10:35.525
I know exactly what you're
doing here, Eggman.

00:10:35.525 --> 00:10:37.927
You went to Knuckles 'cause you
knew he'd have pity on you,

00:10:37.927 --> 00:10:39.562
and he and Sonic
would fight about it

00:10:39.562 --> 00:10:43.299
so you could go behind their backs
and steal the Chaos Emerald!

00:10:43.299 --> 00:10:44.600
Eh..

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.402
Eggman, is that true?

00:10:46.402 --> 00:10:47.770
No, of course not!

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:49.839
She's lying, Knuckles!

00:10:49.839 --> 00:10:51.441
Payback time!

00:10:51.441 --> 00:10:53.309
Haaa...!

00:10:53.309 --> 00:10:54.544
No, Amy.

00:10:54.544 --> 00:10:55.845
[Yelling in frustration]

00:10:55.845 --> 00:10:57.580
[Grunt]

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.450
I know I can always
count on you, Knuckles.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:03.352
Knuckles, you have
got to be kidding me.

00:11:03.352 --> 00:11:06.255
How many more times are you
gonna fall for Eggman's tricks?

00:11:06.255 --> 00:11:07.723
Think about it.

00:11:08.691 --> 00:11:10.259
Help me, please!

00:11:10.259 --> 00:11:13.896
Are you sure we can go back if we
get ahold of the Chaos Emerald?

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:16.799
Heh.

00:11:16.799 --> 00:11:20.269
Please let me keep the
Chaos Emerald. Please?

00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:22.705
Why, thank you so much, Knuckles!

00:11:22.705 --> 00:11:25.208
No, thank you, Dr. Eggman.

00:11:25.208 --> 00:11:28.511
I will give this Chaos
Emerald the utmost care.

00:11:28.511 --> 00:11:29.512
Uh...

00:11:29.512 --> 00:11:30.713
I'll trust you.

00:11:30.713 --> 00:11:32.682
[Evil chuckle]

00:11:32.682 --> 00:11:35.618
I will soon realize
the Eggman Empire.

00:11:35.618 --> 00:11:38.087
Seriously, Eggman's
never gonna change.

00:11:38.087 --> 00:11:39.822
Eggman says he's seen the light,

00:11:39.822 --> 00:11:41.591
and I'm willing to give him
the benefit of the doubt

00:11:41.591 --> 00:11:43.493
and help him get off this planet.

00:11:43.493 --> 00:11:44.460
[Grunt]

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.395
Here we go again.

00:11:46.395 --> 00:11:50.166
Eggman lied before, Knuckles,
and now he's lying again.

00:11:50.166 --> 00:11:53.069
I'm giving him the Chaos Emerald.

00:11:53.402 --> 00:11:55.805
You're gonna have to go
through me to get it.

00:11:55.805 --> 00:11:56.806
Uh!

00:11:56.806 --> 00:11:58.341
Is that so?

00:11:59.208 --> 00:12:01.410
But first, you'll have
to go through me.

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:02.979
[Bickering] This is terrible!

00:12:02.979 --> 00:12:04.714
They shouldn't be fighting
with each other!

00:12:05.047 --> 00:12:06.649
Stop fighting, you two!

00:12:06.649 --> 00:12:09.919
We have to focus on the bigger
crisis threatening all of us.

00:12:09.919 --> 00:12:11.554
If all we do is argue and fight,

00:12:11.554 --> 00:12:14.557
how are we supposed to band
together and save the universe?

00:12:14.557 --> 00:12:15.925
Out of the way, Cosmo!

00:12:15.925 --> 00:12:17.460
We don't want you to get hurt.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.662
COSMO: Huh!
SONIC/KNUCKLES: [GRUNTING]

00:12:19.662 --> 00:12:21.597
Maybe I was wrong.

00:12:21.597 --> 00:12:23.533
Maybe they aren't the heroes
I thought they were.

00:12:23.533 --> 00:12:28.104
Aah!

00:12:28.104 --> 00:12:29.505
[Gasp]

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:32.742
What now?

00:12:39.615 --> 00:12:43.119
Dr. Eggman! We're sorry
we kept you waiting!

00:12:43.119 --> 00:12:44.987
We're here to rescue you!

00:12:44.987 --> 00:12:47.990
Metal meddlers! I
don't need rescuing!

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:50.159
Bokkun told us that
you were in trouble!

00:12:50.159 --> 00:12:51.127
A jam!

00:12:51.127 --> 00:12:52.728
A predicament!

00:12:52.728 --> 00:12:54.263
What did he say?

00:12:54.263 --> 00:12:57.867
He told us that nobody fell for your
plan to steal the Chaos Emerald.

00:12:57.867 --> 00:13:00.469
I wouldn't go so far as
to say nobody fell for it.

00:13:00.469 --> 00:13:01.971
Knuckles certainly did.

00:13:01.971 --> 00:13:02.772
Oops!

00:13:02.772 --> 00:13:04.507
I don't believe it!

00:13:04.507 --> 00:13:05.942
Grrrr! Eggman!

00:13:05.942 --> 00:13:08.945
Sorry, Knuckles. What can I say?

00:13:09.378 --> 00:13:11.280
Hate to say I told you so.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.215
Argh!

00:13:12.215 --> 00:13:13.416
You tricked me!

00:13:13.416 --> 00:13:14.784
That's right.

00:13:14.784 --> 00:13:16.118
[Grunt]

00:13:19.956 --> 00:13:21.424
Heh, heh.

00:13:21.424 --> 00:13:23.559
But now you'll give
me that Emerald,

00:13:23.559 --> 00:13:27.196
or I'll crush your friend in the
palm of my giant, metal hand!

00:13:27.196 --> 00:13:29.966
DECOE: This is a much better
plan than the last one.

00:13:29.966 --> 00:13:32.068
BOCOE: Your microphone
is still on, Decoe.

00:13:32.068 --> 00:13:32.668
Grr!

00:13:32.668 --> 00:13:34.103
Huh!

00:13:34.604 --> 00:13:35.805
What do we do?

00:13:35.805 --> 00:13:37.406
Chao chao!

00:13:37.406 --> 00:13:38.641
Come on, Tails.

00:13:38.641 --> 00:13:40.610
Cosmo!

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:42.578
Hmm-hmm. Now's my chance.

00:13:42.578 --> 00:13:44.480
Grr! Put her down, Eggman!

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.082
Don't think so.

00:13:46.082 --> 00:13:48.818
Give us the Chaos Emerald!
Then we'll drop her.

00:13:48.818 --> 00:13:50.920
I mean, put her down gently.

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.122
Hello, beautiful.

00:13:53.122 --> 00:13:54.357
Huh?

00:13:54.357 --> 00:13:55.891
What's going on here?

00:13:55.891 --> 00:13:56.959
Ahh!

00:13:56.959 --> 00:13:57.693
Aah!

00:14:00.196 --> 00:14:02.198
It's a Metarex!

00:14:03.099 --> 00:14:04.467
[Growling]

00:14:09.572 --> 00:14:12.375
Ah! That frog's a jewel hog.

00:14:15.811 --> 00:14:18.514
Aah! That thing ate the Emerald!

00:14:18.514 --> 00:14:20.116
All right, boys.

00:14:20.116 --> 00:14:22.918
Annihilate that amphibian
and the Emerald is ours.

00:14:22.918 --> 00:14:24.854
Whatever you say, doctor!

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:30.793
Aaaaaaaaah!

00:14:30.793 --> 00:14:32.361
[Grunt] Are you okay?

00:14:32.361 --> 00:14:34.430
Forget me. Get the Emerald!

00:14:39.035 --> 00:14:40.002
Hya!

00:14:45.574 --> 00:14:48.344
Aah! The drill isn't working!

00:14:48.344 --> 00:14:50.179
Its armor is too strong.

00:14:50.179 --> 00:14:51.947
What's that thing made of?

00:14:56.986 --> 00:14:58.287
Whoa!

00:14:58.287 --> 00:15:00.056
We just got a tongue lashing!

00:15:00.056 --> 00:15:02.792
I don't think we can
beat it, Dr. Eggman.

00:15:02.792 --> 00:15:03.759
I have a plan.

00:15:03.759 --> 00:15:05.661
Let's let Sonic and the
others take care of it.

00:15:05.661 --> 00:15:09.098
Get this thing back on its
feet and keep battling!

00:15:09.098 --> 00:15:12.168
You who disturb the
order of the universe—

00:15:12.168 --> 00:15:15.771
[Low ribbit] You cannot
have the Chaos Emeralds.

00:15:15.771 --> 00:15:17.606
You misuse their power.

00:15:17.606 --> 00:15:20.943
[Low ribbit] We are the only ones
who should possess the Emeralds.

00:15:20.943 --> 00:15:22.378
Really?

00:15:22.378 --> 00:15:24.814
I'll take a stab at
seizing it anyway.

00:15:24.814 --> 00:15:28.417
Now, stand still, so I
can make a frog-kabob!

00:15:28.417 --> 00:15:29.919
[Evil laughter]

00:15:31.454 --> 00:15:32.888
[Growling]

00:15:33.389 --> 00:15:34.690
[Growling]

00:15:42.398 --> 00:15:49.105
[All screaming]

00:15:49.105 --> 00:15:52.608
I think that frog just skewered us!

00:15:58.814 --> 00:15:59.315
Huh!

00:15:59.315 --> 00:16:03.486
[Grunting]

00:16:04.787 --> 00:16:05.821
Oof!

00:16:05.821 --> 00:16:06.789
Whoa!

00:16:08.391 --> 00:16:09.458
Oof!

00:16:10.226 --> 00:16:13.295
[Sounds of fighting]

00:16:14.897 --> 00:16:15.865
[Grunt]

00:16:15.865 --> 00:16:18.033
I cannot allow you to deter me.

00:16:18.033 --> 00:16:19.201
I have a mission.

00:16:19.201 --> 00:16:21.537
I have come for the Planet Egg.

00:16:21.537 --> 00:16:23.773
Do you think they can stop it?

00:16:23.773 --> 00:16:24.740
They have to.

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.810
If it captures the Planet Egg,
the whole planet will flood again.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:30.112
We're open to suggestions, Cosmo.

00:16:30.112 --> 00:16:31.514
Don't worry, guys.

00:16:31.514 --> 00:16:32.915
I've got an idea.

00:16:33.516 --> 00:16:36.452
[Low ribbit]

00:16:36.452 --> 00:16:37.787
Sonic!

00:16:37.787 --> 00:16:39.722
We're not done with you yet.

00:16:39.722 --> 00:16:40.656
Ha!

00:16:41.924 --> 00:16:43.559
[Low ribbit]

00:16:46.829 --> 00:16:48.864
Oh, man. How do we stop this thing?

00:16:48.864 --> 00:16:50.433
Hey, Metarex!

00:16:50.433 --> 00:16:51.600
Over here!

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.968
[Gasp] He has the...

00:16:52.968 --> 00:16:54.703
the Planet Egg!

00:16:55.104 --> 00:16:58.007
So, you have been
hiding it from me!

00:16:58.007 --> 00:16:59.408
[Low ribbit]

00:17:03.212 --> 00:17:05.848
If you want it, come and get it!

00:17:05.848 --> 00:17:08.050
You will regret this!

00:17:08.551 --> 00:17:10.453
[Growl]

00:17:10.453 --> 00:17:13.055
We have to do something
to help him.

00:17:13.055 --> 00:17:15.124
Maybe Chris knows what he's doing.

00:17:15.124 --> 00:17:16.058
But still.

00:17:16.058 --> 00:17:18.127
I'm not waiting to find out.

00:17:18.127 --> 00:17:22.765
Ya know what, something tells me
this plan involves the big cannon.

00:17:28.237 --> 00:17:29.438
[Growling]

00:17:29.438 --> 00:17:31.640
All right! He fell for it!

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.443
Heh! Come catch me if you can!

00:17:34.443 --> 00:17:35.845
Closer...

00:17:36.212 --> 00:17:37.413
Closer...

00:17:38.414 --> 00:17:39.415
Now!

00:17:39.915 --> 00:17:41.417
Sonic!

00:17:41.984 --> 00:17:42.818
[Grunt]

00:17:42.818 --> 00:17:43.786
Ha!

00:17:43.786 --> 00:17:45.421
The heave-ho festival.

00:17:45.421 --> 00:17:47.356
[Grunt]

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:49.492
Sonic, catch!

00:17:51.026 --> 00:17:53.562
[Grunting]

00:18:01.309 --> 00:18:03.411
[Grunting]

00:18:03.411 --> 00:18:07.348
Connecting the energy from the
energy chamber to the main cannon.

00:18:07.348 --> 00:18:11.019
Pressurizing the energy within
the cannon's electrical ducts.

00:18:11.019 --> 00:18:12.687
Okay. Ready, Sonic?

00:18:12.687 --> 00:18:14.789
Do I really have to
go through with this?

00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:16.224
Get serious, Sonic.

00:18:16.224 --> 00:18:18.660
We've got Secco's Planet
Egg, and the Chaos Emerald,

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.795
and the whole universe at stake.

00:18:20.795 --> 00:18:23.731
All right! Here we go.

00:18:25.834 --> 00:18:27.135
[Grunting]

00:18:27.802 --> 00:18:29.070
Ugh!

00:18:30.038 --> 00:18:31.840
Uh.

00:18:34.609 --> 00:18:37.812
[Grunts and yells]

00:18:42.517 --> 00:18:45.019
Hold your position steady, Sonic.

00:18:45.019 --> 00:18:47.555
Metarex target straight ahead.

00:18:48.089 --> 00:18:50.225
Sonic Power Cannon...

00:18:50.225 --> 00:18:51.893
Fire!

00:18:54.129 --> 00:18:57.565
[Roaring]

00:18:57.565 --> 00:18:58.800
Oh, yeah!

00:19:01.169 --> 00:19:02.103
Knuckles!

00:19:02.103 --> 00:19:03.771
[Gasp] Are you okay?

00:19:04.339 --> 00:19:06.674
Yeah, and I think the
Planet Egg is okay, too.

00:19:06.674 --> 00:19:08.476
Huh?

00:19:08.476 --> 00:19:10.111
Huh? I didn't do it.

00:19:10.912 --> 00:19:11.880
Is that a...

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.381
beach ball?

00:19:13.715 --> 00:19:15.116
Sonic!

00:19:17.085 --> 00:19:18.019
Yes!

00:19:18.987 --> 00:19:19.988
[Grunt]

00:19:19.988 --> 00:19:23.258
I owe all of you a
really big apology.

00:19:23.258 --> 00:19:25.360
We're not gonna hold it
against you, Knuckles.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.262
You made a bad call. That's all.

00:19:27.262 --> 00:19:30.632
I guess so, but how could
I let Eggman fool me?

00:19:30.632 --> 00:19:33.101
Eggman knows he tricked
you once before,

00:19:33.101 --> 00:19:34.636
and it worked again.

00:19:34.636 --> 00:19:35.770
Grr.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:37.238
Don't feel bad, Knuckles.

00:19:37.238 --> 00:19:38.873
You have a very trusting heart,

00:19:38.873 --> 00:19:41.075
and you want to believe
there's good in everybody.

00:19:41.075 --> 00:19:43.011
Because, like me, you
have a dream that

00:19:43.011 --> 00:19:45.713
everyone in the universe
will unite one day.

00:19:45.713 --> 00:19:48.716
Uhh, thanks for looking
at it that way, Cosmo.

00:19:49.184 --> 00:19:51.686
Who knows? Maybe
that is the reason.

00:19:52.086 --> 00:19:53.454
I think it is

00:19:53.454 --> 00:19:55.757
That's a nice way of
looking at it, Knuckles,

00:19:55.757 --> 00:19:58.293
but it doesn't change the
fact that you're a sucker.

00:19:58.293 --> 00:19:59.160
Huh?

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.228
I'm gonna—!

00:20:00.228 --> 00:20:01.930
[Everyone laughing]

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:04.832
Let's start searching for
the other Chaos Emeralds!

00:20:05.266 --> 00:20:07.936
What number failure
was that, Bocoe?

00:20:07.936 --> 00:20:10.672
I lost count somewhere around 50.

00:20:10.672 --> 00:20:13.541
Whatever number it was,
it better be the last.

00:20:13.541 --> 00:20:16.711
I'm tired of you tin
cans ruining everything.

00:20:16.711 --> 00:20:19.080
It's not our fault.
It was Bokkun's plan.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.015
And he's the one who gave
your position away,

00:20:21.015 --> 00:20:22.684
and then told us to save you.

00:20:22.684 --> 00:20:23.685
Grr...!

00:20:23.685 --> 00:20:26.054
Wait'll I get my hands on him!

00:20:26.054 --> 00:20:28.356
Aw, don't feel bad, sugar.

00:20:28.356 --> 00:20:29.924
You did everything right.

00:20:29.924 --> 00:20:31.559
It'll work out next time.

00:20:31.559 --> 00:20:34.562
There will be a next
time, won't there?

00:20:34.562 --> 00:20:35.797
Not for me.

00:20:36.764 --> 00:20:38.266
You sure?

00:20:40.468 --> 00:20:42.136
Oh, whatever you say.

00:20:43.104 --> 00:20:45.039
I'll do whatever you want.

00:20:45.406 --> 00:20:47.942
[Crying]

00:20:47.942 --> 00:20:50.144
Waaaah!

00:20:50.144 --> 00:20:52.780
[Sobbing]
