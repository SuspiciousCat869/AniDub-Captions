00:00:00.434 --> 00:00:01.869
Last time on Sonic X,

00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:04.571
Chris learned that his world
and Sonic's were once one,

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:06.573
but since the planets
started to recombine,

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:08.642
time itself is
screeching to a halt.

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:11.612
The only way to stop the clock
is to cause Chaos Control

00:00:11.612 --> 00:00:14.147
and send Sonic and his
friends back to their world.

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:15.382
Suspecting a trick,

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:16.884
Chris confronted Dr. Eggman,

00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:20.087
and was shocked to discover the
time-freeze fiasco was real.

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:23.123
Now Tails and Chuck are working
overtime to build a machine

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:24.424
that can send our heroes home.

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:27.628
Can they conquer the secrets of
Chaos Control before time runs out?

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:29.630
Find out next on Sonic X!

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.765
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:34.835
Gotta go fast

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.771
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:43.610
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

Got ourselves a situation

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.714
Stuck in a new location

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:51.318
Without any explanation

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.387
No talk of relaxation

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.022
Don't, don't, don't

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:56.823
Don't blink, don't think

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:58.625
Just go, go, go, go

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.127
Go, go

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:05.666
Sonic is on the run

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.534
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:11.271
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

Sonic X

00:01:32.922 --> 00:01:35.658
We now go live to the
office of the president.

00:01:35.658 --> 00:01:36.893
My fellow citizens,

00:01:36.893 --> 00:01:39.028
I have sad news to
bring you this morning.

00:01:39.028 --> 00:01:41.464
Many months ago, a connection
was established between

00:01:41.464 --> 00:01:43.366
Sonic's world and our own.

00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:46.970
Now, regrettably, that connection
must be severed forever.

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:10.860
Morning, Chris.

00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:12.862
Good morning, Sonic.

00:02:13.997 --> 00:02:15.598
How's it going, guy?

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.133
Okay.

00:02:17.634 --> 00:02:20.136
We can go for a run
later, if you want to.

00:02:20.637 --> 00:02:21.871
Sure.

00:02:25.942 --> 00:02:28.178
Unfortunately, this is the last day

00:02:28.178 --> 00:02:30.513
we will spend with
Sonic and his friends.

00:02:30.513 --> 00:02:33.583
Tonight, they must return
to their own world.

00:02:33.583 --> 00:02:35.819
AMY: Personally, I don't
see why it's such a problem

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.854
if time suddenly comes to a stop.

00:02:37.854 --> 00:02:40.390
If I don't get older, I
won't get any wrinkles.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.325
But, Amy, don't you
think you'd get bored

00:02:42.325 --> 00:02:44.260
if you were forced to
live the same day over

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.962
and over again for ever and ever?

00:02:45.962 --> 00:02:48.131
If you don't get any older,

00:02:48.131 --> 00:02:50.033
you'll never get birthday presents.

00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:51.634
I didn't think of that.

00:02:51.634 --> 00:02:54.604
I have school. See ya later.

00:02:54.604 --> 00:02:55.839
Enjoy your day, Chris.

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:56.539
Bye!

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:57.774
DAD: Have a good time!
MOM: Take care, sweetie!

00:03:02.312 --> 00:03:04.314
[Grunt] No good.

00:03:04.314 --> 00:03:07.050
I wonder what we're doing wrong?

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.285
And on behalf of all our citizens,

00:03:09.285 --> 00:03:12.021
I extend our best wishes
to Sonic and his friends.

00:03:12.021 --> 00:03:12.989
[Cough]

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.158
As you make the journey
back to your home world,

00:03:15.158 --> 00:03:16.492
please know that this world

00:03:16.492 --> 00:03:19.429
will never forget your acts
of courage and heroism.

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:21.130
What a blowhard.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.433
That mealy-mouth, gutless wonder
should have done something

00:03:23.433 --> 00:03:26.336
to get rid of those
freeloaders a long time ago.

00:03:27.303 --> 00:03:29.639
Why build an expensive
machine to get rid of them,

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.141
when a couple of well-aimed
missiles could do the trick?

00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:32.942
[Phone rings]

00:03:32.942 --> 00:03:33.910
Basher here.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.512
Commander, we think Eggman
is up to something.

00:03:36.913 --> 00:03:38.448
What's he doing?

00:03:38.448 --> 00:03:41.351
He's working on
something suspicious.

00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:42.585
What should we do?

00:03:44.287 --> 00:03:46.222
Don't let Eggman out of your sight.

00:03:46.222 --> 00:03:47.423
Watch him like a hawk.

00:03:47.423 --> 00:03:48.892
I want to know his every move.

00:03:48.892 --> 00:03:50.526
And report to me directly!

00:03:50.526 --> 00:03:51.661
Is that clear?

00:03:51.661 --> 00:03:52.729
Yes, sir!

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:56.132
Eggman's obviously planning
to make one last sneak attack

00:03:56.132 --> 00:03:57.533
before he takes a hike.

00:03:57.533 --> 00:04:00.069
He thinks he can catch
us with our guard down.

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:01.938
We had a chance to get
rid of Eggman once,

00:04:01.938 --> 00:04:03.406
but the president went wobbly.

00:04:03.406 --> 00:04:06.509
He was too scared civilians
might get hurt.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.787
Well, I'm gonna finish off that
freaky fanatic once and for all!

00:04:17.787 --> 00:04:20.690
And no lily-livered
politician's gonna stop me!

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:21.324
[School bell rings]

00:04:21.324 --> 00:04:23.693
I wish Sonic and the others
didn't have to go back.

00:04:23.693 --> 00:04:27.163
On TV, they said time's gonna
stop if they don't go home.

00:04:27.163 --> 00:04:29.599
I know it's important and all.

00:04:30.033 --> 00:04:32.602
But... it's gonna be lonesome.

00:04:32.602 --> 00:04:36.172
I don't want things to go back to
the way they were before Sonic came.

00:04:36.172 --> 00:04:37.140
[Sigh]

00:04:38.107 --> 00:04:40.043
From the first time we met,

00:04:40.043 --> 00:04:43.913
it seemed like Sonic and I
were meant to be friends.

00:04:43.913 --> 00:04:45.481
Right from the start,

00:04:45.481 --> 00:04:48.151
we always looked
out for each other.

00:04:48.151 --> 00:04:50.119
Now what if Sonic gets in trouble,

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:52.055
and I'm not there to help him?

00:04:52.055 --> 00:04:53.089
Oh!

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:54.223

Aah!

00:05:13.343 --> 00:05:15.979
I wonder why our radar systems
didn't detect that fleet?

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:17.547
Unfortunately...

00:05:17.547 --> 00:05:19.115
We unplugged the radar...

00:05:19.115 --> 00:05:20.583
We wanted to watch TV.

00:05:20.583 --> 00:05:22.652
This base needs more

ordered this attack!

is secure, Colonel.

Hm?

They're not fightin' fair, Eggman.

00:05:57.086 --> 00:05:58.721
They've got you
totally outnumbered.

00:05:58.721 --> 00:06:00.323
They may have me
completely surrounded

00:06:00.323 --> 00:06:02.258
with thousands of
robotic attack craft,

00:06:02.258 --> 00:06:05.161
but I possess the one weapon
that can easily defeat them all,

00:06:05.161 --> 00:06:07.096
which is my super-superior brain!

00:06:07.096 --> 00:06:08.398
Aah!

00:06:09.365 --> 00:06:12.235
It doesn't take a real big
brain to see you're in trouble.

00:06:12.235 --> 00:06:13.369
You should leave.

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:15.571
Dr. Eggman never admits defeat,

00:06:15.571 --> 00:06:16.939
especially when he loses.

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:17.807

You will probably kick me in the

but I think you should
listen to Sonic.

This situation is hopeless.

to be realistic sometimes.

Oof!

00:08:28.538 --> 00:08:29.939
Time for a merger.

00:08:29.939 --> 00:08:31.240

Behold my super fortress!

00:08:59.502 --> 00:09:01.704
The greatest fighting
machine ever invented!

00:09:01.704 --> 00:09:03.573
The Grand Egg Imperial!

00:09:03.573 --> 00:09:05.708
We could save ourselves
a lot of time and trouble

00:09:05.708 --> 00:09:07.443
if we abandon ship now.

00:09:07.443 --> 00:09:08.144

those robots down in flames.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.618

Hm?

I hope you don't
mind us droppin' in.

00:09:30.933 --> 00:09:33.402
No! I don't mind at all.

need your help, hedgehog!

[Laughing]

00:09:59.028 --> 00:10:00.963

What's this?

00:10:08.404 --> 00:10:10.439
We collared the commander,
Mr. President.

00:10:10.439 --> 00:10:12.842
We're gonna march him off
to the military police.

00:10:12.842 --> 00:10:14.143
Good work, officer!

00:10:14.143 --> 00:10:15.011
Take him away.

00:10:15.011 --> 00:10:16.946
Tell the president I'm not sorry.

00:10:16.946 --> 00:10:18.881
This country used to be strong,

00:10:18.881 --> 00:10:20.516
but now it's on the
brink of disaster,

00:10:20.516 --> 00:10:22.251
thanks to his support for Sonic.

00:10:22.251 --> 00:10:24.720
You'll see!

00:10:25.254 --> 00:10:26.722
He's got a point.

00:10:26.722 --> 00:10:30.126
Sonic's okay, but sometimes
he's a real troublemaker.

00:10:30.126 --> 00:10:31.460
I'm no Sonic fan,

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.964
but it was Eggman who caused
Chaos Control and sent us here.

00:10:34.964 --> 00:10:38.801
It's all his fault our worlds joined
together and we got in this mess.

00:10:38.801 --> 00:10:41.704
I guess it doesn't
matter who's to blame.

00:10:41.704 --> 00:10:44.607
The important thing is to try
and set things right again.

00:10:45.141 --> 00:10:47.977
We can worry about settling
the score with Dr. Eggman

00:10:47.977 --> 00:10:49.745
once we make it back
to our own world.

00:10:49.745 --> 00:10:51.380
We have to act at once.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.815
The past isn't important.

00:10:52.815 --> 00:10:54.717
What's at stake now is our future.

00:10:54.717 --> 00:10:58.154
All of you must return to your
world before time comes to a stop.

00:10:58.154 --> 00:10:59.722
We won't be going anywhere

00:10:59.722 --> 00:11:03.092
unless Tails and Professor
Thorndyke finish their machine.

00:11:05.027 --> 00:11:07.096
This is the last part we need!

00:11:07.096 --> 00:11:09.999
All we have to do is put it
in the machine, and we're set!

00:11:09.999 --> 00:11:11.901
Let's test it out
and make sure works.

00:11:11.901 --> 00:11:14.036
Looks like we did it, Chuck!

This is the worst day of my life.

00:11:23.591 --> 00:11:27.428
Soon, Sonic'll be gone. Forever.

00:11:28.028 --> 00:11:31.298
And we'll never see each
other... ever again.

00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:47.448
Sonic's my best friend.

00:11:47.448 --> 00:11:49.350
It's not fair.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.385
I think we should
go and see them off.

00:11:51.385 --> 00:11:52.820
Don't you?

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.256
Sure, but Chris asked
us not to come along,

00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:56.957
so we'll have to stay out of sight.

00:12:11.705 --> 00:12:13.307
Hey, Sonic?

00:12:13.307 --> 00:12:14.508
Yeah, Chris?

00:12:14.508 --> 00:12:16.977
Do you really wanna
go back to your world?

00:12:16.977 --> 00:12:19.280
Well, I don't have a choice.

00:12:20.548 --> 00:12:22.650
As long as I've got places
to run and explore,

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:23.951
I'll be happy.

00:12:24.919 --> 00:12:25.886
That's good.

00:12:45.906 --> 00:12:46.874
Goodbye, guys.

00:12:46.874 --> 00:12:48.008
We'll miss you.

00:12:48.008 --> 00:12:49.777
We wish you didn't have to go.

00:12:55.883 --> 00:12:57.851
Time to see if this machine works.

00:12:58.152 --> 00:12:59.486
Yeah!

We don't have enough power, Tails.

00:13:11.599 --> 00:13:13.033
What'll we do?

00:13:13.033 --> 00:13:15.102
The other Emeralds
are still missing.

00:13:18.739 --> 00:13:20.908
If they don't get another Emerald,

00:13:20.908 --> 00:13:23.510
they won't be able to
cause Chaos Control.

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:26.246
Sonic and the others
will have to stay here.

00:13:26.246 --> 00:13:28.115
You could use one of these!

00:13:30.217 --> 00:13:31.085
[Grunt]

00:13:34.321 --> 00:13:36.457
Great! We have enough power now.

00:13:36.457 --> 00:13:38.959
All right, Tails. Let's power up.

00:13:38.959 --> 00:13:39.927
Ahh!

00:13:41.996 --> 00:13:44.331
[Crowd murmurs in excitement]

00:13:44.331 --> 00:13:45.899
I can't wait.

I guess it won't be long before
we're all back home, guys.

DR. EGGMAN: The pleasure
was all yours!

Take care!

00:14:14.294 --> 00:14:16.230
It was nice attacking you!

00:14:20.167 --> 00:14:22.870
Hey, why did it just shut off?

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:23.937
Chao?

00:14:23.937 --> 00:14:26.473
We can still go back
home, can't we?

00:14:26.473 --> 00:14:27.441
[Gasping]

00:14:28.208 --> 00:14:29.176
[Gasping]

00:14:31.111 --> 00:14:32.746
There was a power burnout.

00:14:32.746 --> 00:14:36.183
We don't have enough energy now
to send the rest of you back.

00:14:36.183 --> 00:14:38.185
[Crowd murmurs]

00:14:38.185 --> 00:14:39.153
Huh?

00:14:40.087 --> 00:14:41.622
[Sigh]

00:14:46.894 --> 00:14:48.796
I'm not giving up yet!

00:14:52.266 --> 00:14:53.834
But Tails...

00:14:53.834 --> 00:14:55.169
If I make some adjustments,

00:14:55.169 --> 00:14:57.705
I think I can draw even
more power for the machine.

00:14:58.672 --> 00:15:00.107
It's worth a try.

00:15:05.579 --> 00:15:06.547
Huh?

00:15:11.085 --> 00:15:12.686
He didn't even get out of the car.

00:15:15.489 --> 00:15:17.558
Maybe it's time for
me to hang it up.

00:15:17.558 --> 00:15:20.094
There's not another competitor
out there like Sonic.

00:15:20.094 --> 00:15:22.029
When he steps through that gate,

00:15:22.029 --> 00:15:24.498
I'll lose the greatest
challenger I ever had.

00:15:29.336 --> 00:15:31.271
Good luck, Sonic.

00:15:31.271 --> 00:15:32.573
And thanks.

00:15:33.807 --> 00:15:35.743
That was the fastest goodbye ever.

00:15:35.743 --> 00:15:38.612
I think he just broke
another world record.

[All laughing]

00:15:45.085 --> 00:15:47.287
Chuck, I think it's fixed.

00:15:47.287 --> 00:15:49.223
Let's give it a go.

[Alarms sound]

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:21.624
That light!

00:16:22.125 --> 00:16:24.361
It's from Space Colony ARK!

00:16:24.361 --> 00:16:26.796
Now we have all the power we need!

00:16:26.796 --> 00:16:28.431
Excellent work, Tails.

00:16:28.431 --> 00:16:29.899
You did great, buddy!

00:16:29.899 --> 00:16:31.001
[Laughing]

00:16:31.901 --> 00:16:33.403
Thanks!

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:42.412
I'm going to miss you.

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:46.282
Yeah. Goodbye, Chuck.

00:16:46.716 --> 00:16:48.985
You've been a great teacher.

00:16:48.985 --> 00:16:51.087
And an excellent friend, too.

00:16:58.695 --> 00:17:00.463
We made this for you, Cream.

00:17:00.964 --> 00:17:03.133
We know how much you like flowers.

00:17:03.133 --> 00:17:05.001
It looks great on you!

00:17:05.001 --> 00:17:06.302
You like it?

00:17:07.003 --> 00:17:08.905
Oh, thank you all!

00:17:08.905 --> 00:17:10.874
I love it!

00:17:10.874 --> 00:17:13.977
But not as much as
I love all of you!

00:17:13.977 --> 00:17:16.713
[Crying] Chao chao chao!

00:17:16.713 --> 00:17:18.815
[Crying]

00:17:18.815 --> 00:17:22.052
Don't cry, Ella, or you're
gonna make me lose it, too.

00:17:23.019 --> 00:17:24.954
Don't worry. I went
to the plant store

00:17:24.954 --> 00:17:27.690
and bought myself a
cactus to take care of.

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:28.625
Aww.

00:17:28.625 --> 00:17:30.093
I named it Amy.

00:17:30.093 --> 00:17:31.428
After you!

00:17:31.428 --> 00:17:33.797
That was sweet of
you, Ella. Thanks.

00:17:34.364 --> 00:17:36.499
Thanks for taking care of us.

00:17:36.499 --> 00:17:38.401
You and Mr. Tanaka made us welcome.

00:17:38.835 --> 00:17:41.137
It was our pleasure.

00:17:41.137 --> 00:17:43.606
I wish... you could
have stayed longer.

00:17:43.606 --> 00:17:44.407
Here.

00:17:44.407 --> 00:17:46.142
This might help you to remember me.

00:17:46.142 --> 00:17:47.110
[Gasp]

00:17:48.912 --> 00:17:50.580
You wrote down your
favorite recipes

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.449
so I can make them
when I'm back home.

00:17:52.449 --> 00:17:53.917
Ella!

00:17:53.917 --> 00:17:55.118
Oh!

00:17:55.552 --> 00:17:58.021
Ella! What'll I do without you?

00:17:58.021 --> 00:17:59.889
[Crying] I don't know!

[Both crying]

00:18:02.392 --> 00:18:04.828
In a second, Sonic will
go through that gate.

00:18:05.595 --> 00:18:07.397
He'll be gone forever.

00:18:07.397 --> 00:18:09.933
But I'm not ready to say goodbye.

00:18:12.435 --> 00:18:14.404
Looks like this story's ending.

00:18:15.939 --> 00:18:18.975
But I still haven't figured
out who you really are.

00:18:18.975 --> 00:18:21.211
You'll have to keep investigating.

00:18:21.211 --> 00:18:22.178
Hurry!

00:18:22.178 --> 00:18:24.114
We can't keep the gate open long!

00:18:24.114 --> 00:18:25.748
You have to leave immediately,

00:18:25.748 --> 00:18:27.217
before there's a power failure!

00:18:27.684 --> 00:18:29.219
Thank you for everything.

00:18:29.219 --> 00:18:31.054
It was nice knowing you!

00:18:31.054 --> 00:18:32.021
Bye-bye!

00:18:32.021 --> 00:18:32.989
Chao chao!

00:18:37.794 --> 00:18:39.129
Thank you all!

00:18:44.801 --> 00:18:47.403
[Laughing] It's been a blast!

00:18:53.176 --> 00:18:56.613
Goodbye, Cream. Amy. Tails.

00:18:56.613 --> 00:18:58.248
I'll never forget you.

00:18:58.248 --> 00:19:00.717
Take this before I change my mind.

00:19:00.717 --> 00:19:02.652
When I saw that gem
in the jewelry store,

00:19:02.652 --> 00:19:04.587
I <i>had</i> to get it for you.

00:19:04.587 --> 00:19:06.222
It was a steal!

00:19:06.956 --> 00:19:08.158
Hm.

00:19:12.362 --> 00:19:13.596
See ya.

00:19:19.702 --> 00:19:26.776
[Sobbing]

00:19:28.711 --> 00:19:30.647
Soon we'll be back home, Sonic.

00:19:30.647 --> 00:19:32.282
Back home.

00:19:32.849 --> 00:19:33.917
Heh.

00:19:33.917 --> 00:19:35.485
Let's go.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:38.388
Hm.

00:19:38.388 --> 00:19:39.422
Okay.

00:19:39.422 --> 00:19:40.823
Sonic...

00:19:40.823 --> 00:19:41.925
Huh?

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.399
Say goodbye.

00:19:49.399 --> 00:19:51.935
You know this is the right thing
to do for both our worlds.

00:19:51.935 --> 00:19:53.903
You can do it, Chris.

00:19:56.606 --> 00:19:57.874
Well, Sonic.

00:19:59.142 --> 00:20:00.410
Chris.

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:02.345
This is it.

00:20:05.815 --> 00:20:07.250
It's been cool.

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:08.952
I'm glad we met.

00:20:14.023 --> 00:20:15.625
Bye, Sonic.

00:20:15.625 --> 00:20:17.560
And good luck.

00:20:22.398 --> 00:20:23.199
Hm.

00:20:35.411 --> 00:20:36.379
[Gasp]

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.483
[All gasping]
