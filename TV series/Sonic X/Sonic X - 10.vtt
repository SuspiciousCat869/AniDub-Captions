WEBVTT

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:08.041
The X-Tornado seems to be
running really great

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.310
since we installed
the Chaos Emerald.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.713
This has to be
just about the smoothest flight

00:00:12.813 --> 00:00:13.981
I've ever been on.

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:15.282
Huh?

00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:21.288
I think it's picked up
something. Aah!

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:25.526
I can't control it.

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:34.501
Something's pulling us
off course.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.907
Maybe it's another
Chaos Emerald.

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:41.909
Oh! Huh?

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:44.711
Stop! Stop!

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:46.413
Oh!

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:48.882
Better go down there.

00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:05.933
Huh?

00:01:19.613 --> 00:01:22.282
Wow!

00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:33.594
[Engine sputters]

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:37.497
TAILS:
Excuse me, sir.

00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:38.832
Hello?

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:40.601
- Yo!
- Huh?

00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:45.572
[Gasps]
Keep away!

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:46.773
Huh?

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:47.774
I'm sorry.

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:51.278
I was in my plane, and the
Chaos Emerald started glowing.

00:01:51.378 --> 00:01:53.680
Don't worry, mister,
I won't hurt you.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.782
Huh?

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:58.518
Sure is some story,
little fella.

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.053
Never would have guessed
that was you

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:02.289
flying that plane up there.

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:05.492
I'm sorry if I frightened you
just now, sir.

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:08.662
I've never seen a stadium
as pretty as this before.

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:11.531
You know, the grass
is practically glowing.

00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:13.133
Thanks for the compliment.

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:14.134
Lots of folks say

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:17.070
the turf here at Diamond Stadium
is the best in the world,

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.606
which makes me happy because
I've been the grounds keeper

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:21.508
here at Diamond for 30 years.

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:22.976
30 years?

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:24.344
You bet.

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:27.514
Only I'm afraid today's my last
day here at the old place.

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:29.116
You see, the Diamond's manager

00:02:29.216 --> 00:02:32.486
wants to build an indoor stadium
with artificial turf,

00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:35.255
so this place
is gonna be demolished.

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:39.960
I tell you, leaving this place
feels like the end of an era.

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:41.628
By the way, little fella,

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:44.097
did you mention something
about an emerald?

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:45.832
Yeah.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:50.037
See? I'm looking for an emerald
just like this one.

00:02:50.137 --> 00:02:51.571
It's called the Chaos Emerald.

00:02:51.672 --> 00:02:52.939
A what?

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.076
Would this be
what you're looking for?

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:58.078
Ah, a Chaos Emerald!

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:01.682
I saw it laying next to the
Dumpster a couple of nights ago.

00:03:01.782 --> 00:03:04.584
I wasn't sure what is was.

00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:06.586
- Wow!
- Ohh!

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.292
Whoa!

00:03:14.094 --> 00:03:15.762
- What is it?
- Is it magic?

00:03:15.896 --> 00:03:18.865
It looks like a laser show.

00:03:21.068 --> 00:03:23.437
I know that light.

00:03:24.104 --> 00:03:28.675
Dr. Eggman, you might want
to take a look at this, sir.

00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:30.811
What is that light?

00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:34.281
It appears to be coming
from the baseball stadium.

00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:36.717
A stadium, you say?

00:03:36.817 --> 00:03:39.052
Fascinating.

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:46.526
I have a feeling there's
an emerald out at that Diamond.

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:48.295
Go, go, go, go, go

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:49.830

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:55.068
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:03:56.703 --> 00:04:00.140
Movin' at the speed of sound,

Stuck in a new location

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:07.781
Without any explanation

00:04:07.881 --> 00:04:09.916
No talk of relaxation

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:11.551
Don't, don't, don't

00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:13.320
Don't blink, don't think

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.155
Just go, go, go, go

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:16.623
Go, go

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:22.162
Sonic is on the run

00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:24.097
Sonic, he's number one

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:27.768
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:04:49.347 --> 00:04:51.216
ELLA: Let's start
with our first course.

00:04:51.316 --> 00:04:53.251
Which knife and fork
should we use?

00:04:53.351 --> 00:04:56.288
Um, these.

00:04:56.388 --> 00:04:57.689
[Giggles]

00:04:57.789 --> 00:04:59.257
I agree.

00:04:59.357 --> 00:05:00.792
Chao chao!

00:05:00.892 --> 00:05:05.764
Right. You're such smart
children, and what good manners!

00:05:05.864 --> 00:05:06.765
Chao!

00:05:06.865 --> 00:05:09.701
I don't see why we have to learn
all this etiquette baloney

00:05:09.801 --> 00:05:11.336
in the first place.

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:13.605
My mom says it's important
to learn good manners

00:05:13.705 --> 00:05:15.474
so we can eat properly.

00:05:15.574 --> 00:05:17.542
I never learned
anything about manners,

00:05:17.642 --> 00:05:19.945
and I've been eating
my whole life.

00:05:20.045 --> 00:05:23.615
Sonic, kindly use
your fruit knife.

00:05:23.715 --> 00:05:25.417
I wonder what's keeping Tails.

00:05:25.517 --> 00:05:27.285
He should be back by now.

00:05:27.385 --> 00:05:29.287
- [Laughs]
- Huh?

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.192
Sorry, I didn't know
it was mealtime,

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:37.529
but Dr. Eggman's got a real
important message for you.

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.431
Not again!

00:05:39.531 --> 00:05:41.566
How dare you barge in on us
like this?

00:05:41.666 --> 00:05:43.401
You need to learn some manners.

00:05:43.502 --> 00:05:46.204
Eh, that's what you say.

00:05:46.838 --> 00:05:48.440
Good evening, Sonic.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.842
I suggest you take a look
out your window.

00:05:50.942 --> 00:05:52.577
Window?

00:05:55.614 --> 00:05:56.581
Ah!

00:05:57.983 --> 00:05:59.251
What is it?

00:05:59.351 --> 00:06:01.620
That light's coming
from the Chaos Emerald.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.988
Is she right?

00:06:03.088 --> 00:06:05.157
You are half right, Cream.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.659
But that's not just
one Chaos Emerald.

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:10.028
Correct.
We both want those Emeralds.

00:06:10.128 --> 00:06:12.397
But why not be
good sports about it?

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:14.666
That's why I suggest you suit up

00:06:14.766 --> 00:06:19.504
and meet me
over at the Diamond Stadium.

00:06:19.604 --> 00:06:20.805
Diamond Stadium?

00:06:20.906 --> 00:06:22.574
What for?

00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:24.376
I challenge you and your friends

00:06:24.476 --> 00:06:27.145
to a game of winner-take-all
baseball.

00:06:27.245 --> 00:06:29.414
[Laughs evilly]

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.450
You guys might be
a little rusty,

00:06:32.551 --> 00:06:34.986
so how about
some batting practice?

00:06:35.086 --> 00:06:36.321
Hee hee hee hee!

00:06:36.421 --> 00:06:37.489
Uh-oh.

00:06:43.061 --> 00:06:47.265
You got a decent swing,
but you keep hitting it foul.

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:49.234
Whoa!

00:06:49.334 --> 00:06:51.269
What kind of pitch was that?

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:53.271
I think it was a screwball.

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:55.740
We have to get to that stadium.

00:07:08.186 --> 00:07:10.455
What just happened there,
little fella?

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:13.592
That always happens when
Chaos Emeralds come together.

00:07:13.692 --> 00:07:15.961
I just hope the wrong person
didn't see it.

00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:17.529
[Eggman laughs evilly]

00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:21.032
Well, if it isn't
my foxy high-flying friend.

00:07:21.132 --> 00:07:22.667
Dr. Eggman!

00:07:22.767 --> 00:07:23.935
[Laughs evilly]

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:28.273
Where's the rest of your team?

00:07:28.373 --> 00:07:29.841
It's almost game time.

00:07:29.941 --> 00:07:31.109
Forget it.

00:07:31.209 --> 00:07:33.845
You want the Chaos Emeralds,
but I won't give them to you.

00:07:33.945 --> 00:07:37.048
Could it be Sonic and his pals
are choosing to forfeit?

00:07:37.148 --> 00:07:40.552
I must say that's
very unsportsmanlike of them.

00:07:40.652 --> 00:07:43.855
If there's one thing I hate
more than a meddling hedgehog,

00:07:43.989 --> 00:07:45.390
it's a quitter.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.193
I don't get it.
What are you talking about?

00:07:48.326 --> 00:07:51.963
If they won't play ball
with me, I still win.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.669
Whoa!

00:07:59.137 --> 00:08:02.040
What's going on here, anyway?

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:06.411
Oh, no!

00:08:06.511 --> 00:08:08.580
He's got the Emerald!

00:08:10.849 --> 00:08:12.851
One down, one to go.

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:14.486
Hand it over.

00:08:14.586 --> 00:08:16.154
I won it fair and square.

00:08:16.288 --> 00:08:19.858
Now give me that Emerald, or
I'll have to use a force play.

00:08:19.991 --> 00:08:22.260
I'd like to see you try it.

00:08:30.802 --> 00:08:33.438
That was close.
Are you all right?

00:08:33.538 --> 00:08:34.272
Knuckles!

00:08:34.372 --> 00:08:36.908
Am I glad to see you!

00:08:38.276 --> 00:08:39.744
Well, look who it is.

00:08:39.844 --> 00:08:42.213
I like your costume.

00:08:42.314 --> 00:08:43.448
You again.

00:08:43.548 --> 00:08:45.383
And what brings you here?

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.552
Doing Sonic's dirty work?

00:08:47.686 --> 00:08:49.187
Let's get out of here, Tails.

00:08:49.287 --> 00:08:51.189
Okay.

00:08:51.289 --> 00:08:52.791
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:58.063
Hey, how's it going, Knuckles?

00:08:59.097 --> 00:09:00.999
Well, if it isn't Sonic.

00:09:01.099 --> 00:09:02.667
I thought you
weren't going to show up,

00:09:02.767 --> 00:09:04.069
so I took one of the Emeralds,

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:06.604
and I was just collecting
the second.

00:09:07.405 --> 00:09:10.108
But now that you're here,
maybe we can play ball.

00:09:10.208 --> 00:09:13.044
All right, just give us back
that Chaos Emerald.

00:09:13.144 --> 00:09:16.047
All in good time,
my speedy little opponent.

00:09:16.147 --> 00:09:19.117
But first, let me introduce you
to my fellow teammates.

00:09:19.217 --> 00:09:20.585
Huh?

00:09:24.289 --> 00:09:26.024
Aah!

00:09:31.629 --> 00:09:33.531
They're scaring me, Amy.

00:09:33.631 --> 00:09:35.467
It's okay.

00:09:40.472 --> 00:09:42.140
Not too shabby.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.776
Now, why don't we knock off
the pregame ceremonies

00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:46.811
and get to the reason
we're all here.

00:09:46.911 --> 00:09:48.313
It's now game time.

00:09:48.413 --> 00:09:49.647
TOGETHER:
Let's play ball.

00:09:49.748 --> 00:09:51.616
You can't have your game here.

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:53.218
Wait, it just so happens

00:09:53.318 --> 00:09:57.689
old Grandpa Chuck here's a big
baseball fan from way back.

00:09:57.789 --> 00:10:01.326
A nice friendly game of baseball
sounds like a great idea to me.

00:10:01.459 --> 00:10:03.161
But, Chuck!

00:10:03.261 --> 00:10:05.196
[Laughs evilly]

00:10:05.296 --> 00:10:07.065
Ah, so, you're Chuck, are you?

00:10:07.165 --> 00:10:09.768
Well, it's a great pleasure
to finally meet you.

00:10:09.868 --> 00:10:12.003
A ball game must sound
most exciting

00:10:12.103 --> 00:10:15.240
after being cooped up in
that laboratory day after day.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.242
Hey, if you want
to have a ball game,

00:10:17.342 --> 00:10:19.010
you have to have it
someplace else.

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:20.845
Isn't anybody listening to me?

00:10:20.945 --> 00:10:23.648
Well, Eggman,
if the others are up for it,

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:26.651
I would be more than happy
to accept your challenge.

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:28.319
But you can't have
your game here!

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.422
You're gonna ruin
all the beautiful turf!

00:10:30.522 --> 00:10:32.223
What's that loudmouth fox

00:10:32.357 --> 00:10:34.692
getting so
bent out of shape for?

00:10:34.793 --> 00:10:35.660
Who knows?

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.661
Hey!

00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:39.531
I'll have you know this stadium
means a lot to my friend.

00:10:39.631 --> 00:10:41.099
It's okay, Tails.

00:10:41.232 --> 00:10:42.500
Huh?

00:10:43.802 --> 00:10:47.505
Only a matter of time
before it's demolished anyway.

00:10:47.605 --> 00:10:49.908
Have I seen you somewhere?

00:10:50.008 --> 00:10:52.510
Maybe during
the seventh-inning stretch.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.346
My name's Albert Butler.
I'm the head grounds keeper.

00:10:55.447 --> 00:10:57.816
Ah!
I thought you looked familiar.

00:10:57.916 --> 00:10:59.918
I've seen you on television.

00:11:00.018 --> 00:11:02.787
You were good friends
with the owner of the Diamonds,

00:11:02.887 --> 00:11:04.656
Elmer Johnson, right?

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:07.325
Wow!
You know him?

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:10.128
Elmer and I
don't talk much anymore.

00:11:10.228 --> 00:11:12.096
[Crying]

00:11:12.197 --> 00:11:14.833
This is such an honor
that I get to play baseball

00:11:14.933 --> 00:11:16.367
in the famous Diamond Stadium.

00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:19.170
Stop your blubbering,
and let's play baseball!

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.139
- Okay.
- How do we play?

00:11:21.239 --> 00:11:22.273
Chao chao!

00:11:22.373 --> 00:11:24.042
All right, everybody,

00:11:24.142 --> 00:11:26.411
time for the Chaos Emerald
Baseball Playoffs.

00:11:26.511 --> 00:11:27.579
It's the first annual

00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:30.915
Eggman Intergalactic
Baseball Challenge.

00:11:31.015 --> 00:11:32.684
This is sad.

00:11:32.784 --> 00:11:35.153
And totally embarrassing.

00:11:35.286 --> 00:11:36.454
One. Two.

00:11:36.588 --> 00:11:37.755
One. Two.

00:11:37.889 --> 00:11:40.358
Does he have to be on our team?

00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:42.427
Amy, do we get to play, too?

00:11:42.527 --> 00:11:45.063
- Don't see why not.
- Chao chao!

00:11:45.196 --> 00:11:47.332
[Grunts]
Oh, yeah.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.301
CHRIS:
Hey, Grandpa, I'm not so sure

00:11:50.401 --> 00:11:52.537
this baseball game
is such a good idea.

00:11:52.637 --> 00:11:54.839
What if Eggman's got
something up his sleeve?

00:11:54.939 --> 00:11:56.407
Chris, you may be right.

00:11:56.508 --> 00:11:59.744
For all we know, that guy
could be using a corked bat.

00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:01.846
That's not exactly what I meant.

00:12:01.946 --> 00:12:05.049
Let's decide which team
will be first to bat.

00:12:05.149 --> 00:12:06.784
Rock, paper.

00:12:06.885 --> 00:12:08.553
KNUCKLES:
You can't be serious.

00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:11.756
You do know what will happen
if Dr. Eggman wins, don't you?

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:13.791
He won't just be
winning the game,

00:12:13.892 --> 00:12:15.894
but the Chaos Emeralds, too.

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:17.195
If Eggman wins this game,

00:12:17.328 --> 00:12:20.031
it'll mean nothing
but catastrophe for all of us.

00:12:20.131 --> 00:12:22.567
I'd say that's nothing
but stinking thinking.

00:12:22.667 --> 00:12:25.036
Why ruin everyone's fun?

00:12:25.136 --> 00:12:27.105
Come on, Knuckles,
don't you want to play?

00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:28.306
Don't be chicken.

00:12:28.406 --> 00:12:29.641
Chao chao chao chao!

00:12:29.741 --> 00:12:31.009
KNUCKLES:
Me? Chicken?

00:12:31.109 --> 00:12:33.044
Perhaps Mr. Knuckles
is simply afraid

00:12:33.144 --> 00:12:34.979
to play a game of baseball.

00:12:35.079 --> 00:12:38.082
Afraid?
I'm not afraid of anything.

00:12:38.182 --> 00:12:39.684
Great.
Then you'll play?

00:12:39.784 --> 00:12:42.520
[Grumbles]

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.322
All right, you asked for it!

00:12:44.455 --> 00:12:47.025
You want a team player,
I'll give you a team player!

00:12:47.158 --> 00:12:48.726
Let's get this game on!

00:12:52.596 --> 00:12:53.897
Let's play ball.

00:12:53.997 --> 00:12:56.032
Bring it on!

00:12:58.201 --> 00:12:59.669
Ugh!

00:12:59.769 --> 00:13:01.071
Strike one.

00:13:01.171 --> 00:13:02.238
Ahh!

00:13:02.372 --> 00:13:03.807
[Whistles]

00:13:05.175 --> 00:13:07.344
Strike two.

00:13:07.444 --> 00:13:09.813
Strike three.
One out.

00:13:09.913 --> 00:13:12.949
How could anybody
hit a ball that fast?

00:13:13.049 --> 00:13:14.951
[Laughs evilly]
Loser!

00:13:15.085 --> 00:13:18.254
Okay, boys,
send in the next sucker.

00:13:18.388 --> 00:13:20.924
It'll probably be a fastball.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:29.633
UMPIRE:
Strike one.

00:13:31.234 --> 00:13:33.637
Hey, umpire, that's not fair!

00:13:33.737 --> 00:13:34.638
What do you want?

00:13:34.738 --> 00:13:37.107
It's not my fault
he's got long arms.

00:13:39.175 --> 00:13:42.112
Give me your best pitch,
ball boy.

00:13:45.415 --> 00:13:47.317
I got it!

00:13:47.417 --> 00:13:48.451
[Cheering]

00:13:48.585 --> 00:13:51.021
We might not lose after all.

00:13:56.126 --> 00:13:58.028
She's out.

00:13:58.128 --> 00:13:59.596
Huh?

00:13:59.729 --> 00:14:01.264
But I thought...

00:14:01.364 --> 00:14:03.533
[Laughs evilly]

00:14:04.701 --> 00:14:06.369
Now I'll show them
what I can do.

00:14:06.469 --> 00:14:09.005
I'm a much better
pitcher anyway.

00:14:11.041 --> 00:14:12.242
Oh!

00:14:13.677 --> 00:14:15.145
Uh, sorry about that.

00:14:18.114 --> 00:14:19.616
Strike.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:24.387
Huh?

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.525
Safe.

00:14:28.658 --> 00:14:30.427
Losing isn't fun.

00:14:32.529 --> 00:14:34.831
And it's out of the park!

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:41.438
Home run!

00:14:41.538 --> 00:14:42.305
Home run!

00:14:42.405 --> 00:14:43.573
You caught it, Sonic,

00:14:43.673 --> 00:14:46.042
but if it's outside the fence,
it doesn't count.

00:14:46.142 --> 00:14:48.945
Who says we gotta play
by the rules anyway?

00:14:49.045 --> 00:14:50.580
Cut me some slack.

00:14:54.517 --> 00:14:55.418
Sorry.

00:14:55.518 --> 00:14:57.253
That's a hit.

00:14:59.055 --> 00:15:01.458
UMPIRE:
Sad to say, but it's a home run.

00:15:01.558 --> 00:15:03.393
[Cheering]

00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:09.933
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:15:10.033 --> 00:15:11.167
This is Scarlet Garcia

00:15:11.267 --> 00:15:13.403
with a live report
from Diamond Stadium.

00:15:13.503 --> 00:15:15.905
There appears to be
a most unusual baseball game

00:15:16.005 --> 00:15:17.741
happening right this moment.

00:15:17.841 --> 00:15:20.210
The notorious Dr. Eggman
and a team of robots

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:23.913
are playing a game against Sonic
and friends here at the stadium,

00:15:24.013 --> 00:15:26.349
the soon to be former home
of the Diamonds.

00:15:26.449 --> 00:15:29.018
This is certain to become
sports history.

00:15:29.119 --> 00:15:30.787
This is Scarlet Garcia
reporting.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.222
Stay tuned to SSTV

00:15:32.355 --> 00:15:34.591
for continuing coverage
of this momentous game.

00:15:34.691 --> 00:15:36.092
CHUCK:
We're closing in on them.

00:15:36.192 --> 00:15:38.528
Now let's give it our best shot!

00:15:38.628 --> 00:15:40.597
- Tanaka!
- Yes, sir.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:42.732
I'm putting in
a pinch hitter for you.

00:15:42.832 --> 00:15:44.567
- Huh?
- It's Cheese.

00:15:44.667 --> 00:15:46.002
Chao!

00:15:54.144 --> 00:15:55.712
UMPIRE:
Ball one.

00:15:55.812 --> 00:15:57.680
Ball two.

00:15:57.814 --> 00:15:59.949
Ball three.

00:16:01.417 --> 00:16:02.819
Ball four.

00:16:02.919 --> 00:16:05.321
- Take your base.
- Chao.

00:16:05.989 --> 00:16:07.624
You big loser!

00:16:07.757 --> 00:16:10.627
You call yourself a pitcher?

00:16:12.929 --> 00:16:13.830
Play ball.

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:18.902
Oh, Mr. Pitcher, could you maybe
not throw the ball too hard?

00:16:19.002 --> 00:16:21.538
I've never played before.

00:16:24.974 --> 00:16:26.142
Balk!

00:16:26.242 --> 00:16:28.611
Batter takes first base.

00:16:28.711 --> 00:16:31.247
Thank you, Mr. Pitcher.

00:16:31.347 --> 00:16:34.117
I ought to throw you
on the scrap heap!

00:16:36.085 --> 00:16:38.822
CHUCK: All right, Knuckles,
another home run!

00:16:38.955 --> 00:16:41.558
AMY:
That means we're tied.

00:16:42.358 --> 00:16:44.794
Huh?
Look, everybody.

00:16:46.663 --> 00:16:48.031
Hey, hey.

00:16:48.131 --> 00:16:50.533
Hey, you guys,
hit a homer over this way.

00:16:50.633 --> 00:16:51.534
Huh?

00:16:51.634 --> 00:16:54.504
Where'd all these people
come from?

00:17:00.643 --> 00:17:02.212
[Grunts]

00:17:02.378 --> 00:17:05.348
You strike out that squirt,
or else!

00:17:05.715 --> 00:17:06.850
[Whimpers]

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.722
UMPIRE:
Strike one.

00:17:13.623 --> 00:17:14.724
Oh, no.

00:17:14.824 --> 00:17:17.727
What if I let
the whole team down?

00:17:18.428 --> 00:17:20.730
Strike two.

00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:22.465
- SONIC: Time-out.
- Huh?

00:17:22.565 --> 00:17:24.701
Hey, Chris.

00:17:28.071 --> 00:17:29.138
There's nothing to it.

00:17:29.239 --> 00:17:32.108
All you have to do
is concentrate.

00:17:32.208 --> 00:17:33.910
That's easy for you to say.

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:35.712
He's pitching so fast.

00:17:35.812 --> 00:17:37.714
So he's throwing
a couple of fastballs.

00:17:37.814 --> 00:17:39.616
You can't let that
get you down, pal.

00:17:39.716 --> 00:17:42.452
Just keep on trying
and don't give up.

00:17:43.686 --> 00:17:46.823
Now get out there
and do your best.

00:17:48.191 --> 00:17:49.592
Okay.

00:17:49.692 --> 00:17:51.027
Play ball.

00:17:51.761 --> 00:17:53.062
[Thinking]
Sonic's right.

00:17:53.162 --> 00:17:55.965
I just have to keep trying.

00:18:02.472 --> 00:18:03.973
Aah!

00:18:04.073 --> 00:18:05.108
Strike three.

00:18:05.208 --> 00:18:07.744
At least I tried my best.

00:18:07.844 --> 00:18:10.113
- CHUCK: Chris, run!
- Huh?

00:18:11.014 --> 00:18:12.548
Ah! Unh!

00:18:16.786 --> 00:18:18.321
UMPIRE:
Safe.

00:18:18.421 --> 00:18:20.223
I did it!

00:18:20.323 --> 00:18:22.659
I got to first base!

00:18:25.895 --> 00:18:28.031
[Cheering]

00:18:30.066 --> 00:18:31.234
Oh, yeah?

00:18:31.334 --> 00:18:35.638
Those bumbling clowns
won't make a fool out of me.

00:18:44.013 --> 00:18:44.914
What's that?

00:18:45.014 --> 00:18:45.915
Oh, dear.

00:18:46.015 --> 00:18:48.017
My robot.
It's malfunctioning.

00:18:48.117 --> 00:18:49.986
It will explode any minute now.

00:18:50.086 --> 00:18:51.020
Run, Sonic!

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.722
Hurry!
Run away!

00:18:52.822 --> 00:18:56.025
Sonic, what are we gonna do?

00:18:56.125 --> 00:18:58.328
He's trying to get us
to forfeit the game.

00:18:58.428 --> 00:19:00.930
I gotta get rid
of this thing quick.

00:19:03.132 --> 00:19:05.568
Hey, you're really hanging on.

00:19:05.668 --> 00:19:07.403
- Sonic!
- Huh?

00:19:07.503 --> 00:19:08.905
Jump, Sonic!
Hurry!

00:19:09.005 --> 00:19:10.673
Okay!

00:19:12.342 --> 00:19:14.477
Hey, watch it, will you?

00:19:18.381 --> 00:19:19.415
Thanks.

00:19:19.515 --> 00:19:21.751
You're a lifesaver.

00:19:21.884 --> 00:19:23.252
[Laughs evilly]

00:19:23.353 --> 00:19:26.022
You may have beaten me
at baseball.

00:19:26.723 --> 00:19:28.925
But with this shiny blue
Chaos Emerald

00:19:29.025 --> 00:19:31.594
snuggled ever so safely
in my pocket,

00:19:31.694 --> 00:19:34.664
I'm the real winner,
after all, aren't I?

00:19:34.764 --> 00:19:36.599
[Laughs evilly]

00:19:39.435 --> 00:19:42.772
Now he has both
the Chaos Emeralds.

00:19:42.872 --> 00:19:45.141
[Cheers and applause]

00:19:46.943 --> 00:19:49.846
What an amazing team!

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:57.620
As you can see, there's been
quite a turnout for this event.

00:19:57.754 --> 00:20:01.290
The game was the last to be
played here at the stadium.

00:20:01.391 --> 00:20:04.060
[Gasps]
Could that be?

00:20:07.363 --> 00:20:10.533
Hey, look.
That's Elmer Johnson.

00:20:11.834 --> 00:20:13.836
I was watching at home.

00:20:13.936 --> 00:20:16.205
I must say it was
quite a remarkable game.

00:20:16.305 --> 00:20:18.207
It's all thanks to you, Al.

00:20:18.307 --> 00:20:20.676
And, well, Al,
I can't help but think

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:23.046
how much you've done
for the Diamonds over the years,

00:20:23.179 --> 00:20:25.114
and what a great friend
you've been.

00:20:25.214 --> 00:20:26.215
Thank you.

00:20:26.315 --> 00:20:28.117
I'm thinking of moving
the Diamond turf

00:20:28.217 --> 00:20:30.019
over to the new stadium intact.

00:20:30.153 --> 00:20:32.088
I sure could use your help.

00:20:32.188 --> 00:20:33.956
Sure thing.

00:20:34.724 --> 00:20:36.959
We may have lost
the Chaos Emerald,

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:40.430
but I think we've learned
a lesson about working together,

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:43.266
and I'm sure you'll agree
we'll be even stronger

00:20:43.366 --> 00:20:45.902
next time we meet Eggman.
