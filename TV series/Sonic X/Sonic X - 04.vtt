WEBVTT

00:00:01.568 --> 00:00:04.304
CHRIS: So, this Chaos Control
created a warp

00:00:04.438 --> 00:00:05.572
in time and space,

00:00:05.706 --> 00:00:08.008
and that's how you guys
ended up here.

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:11.411
Hmm, I think
I understand that much.

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:13.714
But I still don't understand
these Chaos Emeralds

00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:15.549
you guys are talking about.

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:17.751
You've never heard
of the Chaos Emeralds?

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:20.354
Boy, you really do have
a lot to learn, don't ya?

00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:23.490
Each Chaos Emerald is filled
with a magical power.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.325
So can you imagine
what would happen

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:27.361
if you found all seven of them.

00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:30.097
But no one has ever found
all seven emeralds,

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:33.567
and now it's highly improbable
that anyone ever will find them.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.369
Why is that?

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:37.004
Well, you see, Cream,

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:40.340
every one of the precious
Chaos Emeralds has disappeared.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.943
SONIC: That doesn't mean
they're gone for good.

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:45.279
Any time the seven
Chaos Emeralds come together

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:46.480
in one place,

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.349
they scatter and disappear
all over again.

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.486
Then that means they're all
still out there someplace.

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:54.221
That's right!

00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:57.090
Only we don't have any way
of knowing where.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.059
If they're on this planet,
that's good.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:01.128
But if they're still on
the planet we came from,

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:02.829
we may never get home.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.999
Listen, if the emeralds
are somewhere on this planet,

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:08.602
and if we can find some way
to locate them all,

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:11.338
maybe we'll be able
to reverse that time warp.

00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:14.708
You guys will be back on your
home planet before you know it.

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:15.709
Right, Sonic?

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:18.178
Yeah, no worries.

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:19.913
Go, go, go, go, go

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:21.448
Gotta go fast

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:23.650
Gotta go fast

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.687
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:28.322 --> 00:01:31.758
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:33.560
Got ourselves a situation

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.862
Stuck in a new location

00:01:35.963 --> 00:01:39.399
Without any explanation

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.501
No talk of relaxation

00:01:41.635 --> 00:01:43.136
Don't, don't, don't

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.905
Don't blink, don't think

00:01:45.038 --> 00:01:46.773
Just go, go, go, go

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:48.241
Go, go

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:53.780
Sonic is on the run

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.682
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:59.419
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:00.921
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:02.923
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:05.492
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:07.394
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:09.763
Sonic X

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:12.599
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.601
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:16.503
Sonic X

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.428
And where are they?

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:42.929
It seems the hedgehog
and his friends

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.465
are staying with a family
in Station Square.

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:46.933
And our agents
have traced Eggman

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.136
to an island somewhere
in the Southern Sea.

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.004
Well, get going!

00:02:51.138 --> 00:02:52.406
I want them captured!

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:53.640
With all due respect,

00:02:53.774 --> 00:02:55.842
it might be best
to keep them under surveillance

00:02:55.976 --> 00:02:58.745
so we can observe
their behavior.

00:02:58.845 --> 00:02:59.880
That's all well and good,

00:03:00.047 --> 00:03:01.715
but you had better pay
special attention

00:03:01.815 --> 00:03:03.784
to that dangerous
Eggman character.

00:03:03.884 --> 00:03:05.886
We've already sent out
a reconnaissance team,

00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:07.154
Mr. President.

00:03:07.254 --> 00:03:10.123
We'll be sure to report back
any suspicious activities.

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:31.845
Any word on the animals?

00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:34.247
We have our operatives
watching them, too, sir,

00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:36.149
and we're dispatching
an undercover agent

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:38.051
to get information on the boy.

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:41.588
If there's any unusual activity,
we'll know about it.

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:48.695
BO Y: Hey, kid,
50 cents for your sandwich.

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:51.164
I bet you that little
hedgehog thing is so fast,

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:52.599
they're never gonna get him.

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:53.834
I bet you're right.

00:03:53.934 --> 00:03:56.636
Chris, you think they'll ever
catch that hedgehog?

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:57.604
Huh?

00:03:57.738 --> 00:03:58.772
I don't know.

00:03:58.872 --> 00:04:01.675
Children,
may I have your attention?

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.878
I'd like to make a brief
announcement to you all.

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:06.446
Your teacher Miss Westerly

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:08.315
will be taking
a leave of absence.

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:09.950
Therefore,
she will not be with you

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.718
for the remainder
of the semester.

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:13.620
- Hmm.
- Oh, wow!

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.691
Please say hello to Mr. Stewart,
who will be your substitute.

00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:18.759
Hello, children.

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.528
CHILDREN:
Hello, Mr. Stewart.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:25.832
He looks nice,
doesn't he, Chris?

00:04:28.068 --> 00:04:30.437
[School bell rings]

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:36.476
Danny, come on, hurry up!

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.612
Okay.
I'll be there in a minute!

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:39.780
[Sighs]

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.615
Christopher Thorndyke?

00:04:42.582 --> 00:04:44.951
The principal told me your name.

00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:47.721
I was wondering if you were
the same Christopher Thorndyke

00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:51.057
whose father is the CEO of
the Starship Software Company,

00:04:51.158 --> 00:04:52.859
Nelson Thorndyke,

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:56.630
and whose mother is the famous
film actress Lindsey Fair.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.865
Yeah, that's me.

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:00.667
I must say, Christopher,

00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:03.870
it's a privilege to meet the son
of such distinguished parents.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.873
Thanks.
That's very nice of you to say.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:09.376
Good meeting you, Christopher.

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:11.478
Good to meet you, too.

00:05:11.578 --> 00:05:13.880
By the way,
this might sound strange,

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.183
but do you have
a favorite animal?

00:05:16.683 --> 00:05:18.385
Well...

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:21.154
Hedgehogs, I guess.

00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:23.156
Ahh!

00:05:23.256 --> 00:05:24.357
Is that weird?

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:26.593
No, not at all.

00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:27.727
DANNY:
Hey, Chris!

00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:29.062
Huh?

00:05:29.763 --> 00:05:31.498
Sorry.
Let's go!

00:05:31.598 --> 00:05:33.567
It was nice talking to ya,
Mr. Stewart.

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:34.768
See ya.

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:53.420
BOTH:
Aah!

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.422
[Beeping]

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:57.390
Hey, what's happening?

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.192
Aah!

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:04.064
Help!
Somebody help me!

00:06:04.164 --> 00:06:06.800
I'm losing control!

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:14.174
ALL:
Whoa!

00:06:23.283 --> 00:06:25.185
Look out!

00:06:25.285 --> 00:06:28.154
I can't stop this thing!

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.528
Whoa!

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:37.898
Hey, are you all right?

00:06:37.998 --> 00:06:39.399
I don't know.

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:42.602
All of a sudden,
the thing had a mind of its own.

00:06:42.702 --> 00:06:44.437
Huh?

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:01.154
Hey, Chris,

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:04.958
what was Mr. Stewart talking to
you about in the hall?

00:07:05.325 --> 00:07:07.527
He asked me
what my favorite animal was.

00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:08.695
That's kind of weird.

00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:11.398
An unusual gemstone
was discovered today

00:07:11.498 --> 00:07:13.733
at a department store
construction site.

00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:14.968
Eyewitnesses at the site

00:07:15.068 --> 00:07:17.737
report that construction
machinery seemed to malfunction

00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:19.673
whenever it came within
close contact

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:21.174
of this strange jewel.

00:07:21.308 --> 00:07:23.009
The stone does appear
to be radiating

00:07:23.143 --> 00:07:26.179
an invisible,
highly charged energy.

00:07:26.313 --> 00:07:30.483
Some of you watching at home
may be experiencing some static.

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:34.421
This is a direct result
of the gem's magnetic power.

00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:35.455
Huh?

00:07:35.555 --> 00:07:38.625
This is an artist's rendering.

00:07:39.693 --> 00:07:41.294
Chao, chao!

00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:44.931
We've gotta tell Sonic!

00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:46.800
Hurry!

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:53.239
Pretty good nap.

00:07:53.373 --> 00:07:54.574
I needed that.

00:07:54.708 --> 00:07:56.977
Sonic, you won't believe it!

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.545
What's up?

00:07:58.645 --> 00:07:59.879
They found one!

00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:01.514
They found one!

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.684
Authorities are conducting
a thorough investigation

00:08:04.784 --> 00:08:05.986
of the surrounding area

00:08:06.086 --> 00:08:08.722
to determine the possible source
of the gem.

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:12.559
SSTV will continue to keep
you posted with further updates.

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:15.996
This is Scarlet Garcia
reporting live from the site

00:08:16.096 --> 00:08:17.564
for SSTV news.

00:08:18.898 --> 00:08:20.700
[Laughs evilly]

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.335
Well, what do you know?

00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:25.138
A Chaos Emerald
right under my nose.

00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:26.773
- Doctor?
- Yes, Decoe.

00:08:26.873 --> 00:08:28.508
Your cards.

00:08:29.376 --> 00:08:31.711
Let's see.

00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:33.279
Which one?

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.381
Hmm.

00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:36.483
I can't choose.

00:08:44.991 --> 00:08:46.860
Beakon!

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.863
Ah, ha ha!

00:09:14.487 --> 00:09:16.790
Enemy aircraft spotted.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.191
MAN:
Roger.

00:09:19.926 --> 00:09:22.195
Once I get my hands
on that Chaos Emerald,

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:24.431
I'll create
an even more powerful robot.

00:09:24.531 --> 00:09:28.301
And getting rid of that pesky
blue hedgehog will be a breeze.

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:31.805
Ah, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:46.386
Be careful.

00:09:46.486 --> 00:09:47.687
Don't get hurt, Tails.

00:09:47.787 --> 00:09:50.056
Don't worry, Cream.
We'll be okay.

00:09:50.156 --> 00:09:51.825
I hope Sonic knows
where he's going.

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:54.461
If he gets lost, we won't know
where to look for him.

00:09:54.561 --> 00:09:55.728
Don't worry about Sonic.

00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:58.498
If anyone can find
the Chaos Emerald, he can.

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:01.468
Good luck, and be sure
to keep your eyes out for Sonic.

00:10:01.568 --> 00:10:04.204
I certainly hope
they can find that emerald.

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:14.447
The place is around here
somewhere.

00:10:14.547 --> 00:10:17.550
Bet I could see it easier
with a bird's-eye view.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:27.393
I'll just chill out up here
and wait for Tails and Amy.

00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:39.939
Hmm?

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:43.309
Well, I do believe
someone is following me.

00:10:44.177 --> 00:10:46.146
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh!

00:10:46.246 --> 00:10:47.447
This could be fun.

00:10:47.547 --> 00:10:48.882
What do you say, Beakon?

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:50.817
Let's sink the finks!

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.965
How do you like them apples?

00:11:06.099 --> 00:11:08.368
You foolish fly-boys thought
you could pull one over

00:11:08.468 --> 00:11:10.370
on the good doctor, didn't you?

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:13.473
Well, I guess the bad doctor
proved you wrong.

00:11:17.277 --> 00:11:18.545
Questions, anyone?

00:11:18.645 --> 00:11:21.614
All right, now you try it.

00:11:22.115 --> 00:11:23.616
Huh?

00:11:26.953 --> 00:11:29.022
What are you looking at, Chris?

00:11:29.789 --> 00:11:32.358
Excuse me, Mr. Stewart.
I'll be right back.

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:34.093
I gotta do something.

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:35.695
Chris!

00:11:36.996 --> 00:11:38.565
Keep working, class.

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:40.867
I need to step away
for a moment.

00:11:40.967 --> 00:11:43.570
Study quietly on your own.

00:11:46.973 --> 00:11:48.975
BOTH:
Oh!

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:58.251
I've just gotta find
that emerald.

00:11:58.351 --> 00:11:59.852
Just got to!

00:12:15.868 --> 00:12:17.937
It's about time.

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:20.473
You'd think they could fly
that thing a little faster.

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:23.843
Hey, Sonic, it's over there!

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:27.480
Chaos Emerald, here I come!

00:12:38.391 --> 00:12:40.193
Wow, pretty freaky, huh?

00:12:40.293 --> 00:12:41.361
Yeah, you said it.

00:12:41.461 --> 00:12:44.063
First that weird hedgehog
comes out of nowhere,

00:12:44.197 --> 00:12:46.165
now this magnetic emerald.

00:12:46.299 --> 00:12:47.200
Hey.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:47.967
Huh?

00:12:48.067 --> 00:12:49.402
What's the matter?

00:12:49.535 --> 00:12:51.537
Look, up there!

00:12:51.671 --> 00:12:53.273
What's that?

00:12:55.475 --> 00:12:57.010
Whoa!

00:12:57.143 --> 00:13:00.280
Hey, it looks like
that Dr. Eggman guy!

00:13:06.653 --> 00:13:09.055
[Laughs evilly]

00:13:18.531 --> 00:13:20.667
What's going on here?

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.001
Hmm?

00:13:24.737 --> 00:13:29.475
Dr. Egghead thinks he can nab
that Chaos Emerald before me.

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:39.719
We're closing in.

00:13:48.027 --> 00:13:50.563
It's that blasted hedgehog!

00:13:50.697 --> 00:13:51.564
Change of plans.

00:13:51.698 --> 00:13:54.033
We'll come back for
our little treasure later on.

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:57.036
First we'll get rid
of that meddling Sonic.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.155
Ow!

00:14:16.255 --> 00:14:18.091
[Laughs evilly]

00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:24.931
Whoa!

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:27.200
Ow!

00:14:29.469 --> 00:14:30.770
Ooh, oh!

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.338
Ooh!

00:14:32.438 --> 00:14:33.806
Ooh.
Oh, oh!

00:14:33.906 --> 00:14:36.909
Oh! Oh! Oh!

00:14:38.811 --> 00:14:40.947
Quick, Amy!

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:42.448
Look!
Sonic, the ring!

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:44.784
I'll throw it to you!

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:46.652
Whoa!

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:49.455
Catch!

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:55.995
Whoa!

00:14:57.597 --> 00:14:59.031
Not good.

00:14:59.132 --> 00:15:01.401
Oh, no, we're too far away!

00:15:01.534 --> 00:15:03.369
Hey, what if we try
to get closer?

00:15:03.469 --> 00:15:05.738
I won't be easy, but I can try.

00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:08.307
All right, let's do it!

00:15:09.642 --> 00:15:11.978
[Laughs evilly]

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:14.280
Now that our speedy friend
is out of the way,

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.516
let's get back to our
original plan, shall we?

00:15:16.616 --> 00:15:18.885
[Laughs evilly]

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.735
Huh!

00:15:35.868 --> 00:15:37.570
Give that back to me!

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:38.638
I can't believe it.

00:15:38.738 --> 00:15:41.274
I found the Chaos Emerald.

00:15:45.912 --> 00:15:47.447
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

00:15:47.547 --> 00:15:48.981
Huh?

00:15:49.549 --> 00:15:51.017
Hey, that's mine!

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:53.085
Sorry.
Not anymore.

00:15:53.186 --> 00:15:54.353
Besides, my dear boy,

00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:56.589
you'd hardly know what to do
with such a thing.

00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:57.623
[Laughs evilly]

00:15:57.723 --> 00:15:59.659
But I found it first!

00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:00.660
Bug off, kid.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.628
- But it's mine!
- Unhand me, you pip-squeak!

00:16:02.728 --> 00:16:03.930
Give me that!

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:05.431
Aah!

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:20.444
Hey!

00:16:20.544 --> 00:16:21.445
Oh!

00:16:21.545 --> 00:16:23.547
Oh!
Knock it off!

00:16:24.649 --> 00:16:26.550
Hey!

00:16:26.651 --> 00:16:28.152
Whoa!

CHRIS:
Whoa! Help!

00:17:04.622 --> 00:17:06.524
Somebody help!

00:17:06.624 --> 00:17:08.592
It's Chris!

00:17:13.064 --> 00:17:14.999
We're coming, Chris!

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:17.702
Chris, hold on!

00:17:24.742 --> 00:17:26.977
[Laughs evilly]

00:17:38.589 --> 00:17:39.924
Hmm?

00:17:40.024 --> 00:17:40.991
[Laughs evilly]

00:17:46.397 --> 00:17:48.299
Ha ha ha!

00:17:49.333 --> 00:17:50.801
Aah!

00:17:50.901 --> 00:17:52.770
Aah!

00:17:53.871 --> 00:17:55.473
I won't let go!

00:17:55.573 --> 00:17:56.907
Give me back that emerald!

00:17:57.007 --> 00:17:58.376
Ahh! Ahh!

00:17:58.476 --> 00:17:59.977
You grubby little beast!

00:18:00.111 --> 00:18:01.512
Let go of my moustache!

00:18:01.612 --> 00:18:02.680
Aah!

00:18:04.982 --> 00:18:08.419
That caterwauling brat
certainly was a handful.

00:18:08.819 --> 00:18:09.920
Aah!

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.122
My emerald!

00:18:11.222 --> 00:18:12.790
Aah!

00:18:17.094 --> 00:18:18.329
Huh?

00:18:28.706 --> 00:18:31.142
I'll save him.

00:18:34.011 --> 00:18:35.212
Aah!

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:44.855
Huh?

00:18:59.303 --> 00:19:02.573
It's good to know someone else
is looking out for the kid.

00:19:02.673 --> 00:19:04.408
Speaking of looking out
for kids,

00:19:04.508 --> 00:19:06.544
I'd better get back to school.

00:19:19.557 --> 00:19:21.959
Now that we have one,
we just need six more!

00:19:22.059 --> 00:19:23.527
That's right, Cream.

00:19:23.627 --> 00:19:25.830
I'm not certain
we should keep it here.

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:28.032
It might have an effect
on my equipment.

00:19:28.165 --> 00:19:29.099
No problem.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.734
If anything goes wrong
with them,

00:19:30.868 --> 00:19:31.902
I'll fix them for ya.

00:19:32.036 --> 00:19:35.239
All right, it's a deal.

00:19:35.339 --> 00:19:37.374
Okay, Grandpa!

00:19:43.113 --> 00:19:45.182
Sonic.

00:19:45.282 --> 00:19:46.383
I'm sorry.

00:19:46.484 --> 00:19:48.419
What are you sorry for?

00:19:48.819 --> 00:19:50.688
Well, for losing...

00:19:50.788 --> 00:19:52.223
Got it back, didn't ya?

00:19:52.323 --> 00:19:54.425
That's all that matters.

00:19:55.826 --> 00:19:58.395
I think you did a great job.

00:20:01.298 --> 00:20:03.801
I did?

00:20:03.934 --> 00:20:05.703
You sure did, Chris.

00:20:05.769 --> 00:20:08.806
Just be a little more careful
next time, huh?

00:20:12.376 --> 00:20:14.378
Thanks.

00:20:16.013 --> 00:20:17.314
Hmm.
