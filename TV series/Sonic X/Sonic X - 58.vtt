WEBVTT

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:18.218
Huh?

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:19.753
Huh?

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:20.687
Chao?

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:21.755
Huh?

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.292
Our scanners picked up
two objects approaching.

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:27.794
Dead ahead and closing fast!

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:28.896
I see 'em!

00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:32.833
[Beeping]

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.370
SONIC: Metarex!

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.273
It looks like they just
stole that Planet Egg.

00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:42.809
We can't let those
two Metarex get away.

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.112
We're gonna fight 'em
to save that Planet Egg!

00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:46.079
Roger!

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.114
[All gasp]

00:00:50.017 --> 00:00:51.985
Fire the laser cannons!

00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:56.356
It bounced right off!

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:03.297
It's trying to pull our wings off!

00:01:03.297 --> 00:01:06.199
We have to do something
before it's too late!

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:09.202
We'll stop it. Load the
Sonic Power Cannon!

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:10.971
We're loading it now.

00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:13.807
Sonic, enter the Power Cannon
and get ready for launch.

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:23.150
[Grunt]

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:25.586
Ready!

00:01:32.893 --> 00:01:35.963
Sonic Power Cannon, fire!

00:01:41.735 --> 00:01:43.270
Oof!

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:44.905
Oh!

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:47.474
[Groan]

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:49.543
[Growling]

00:01:53.347 --> 00:01:55.449
Looks like we knocked
out the Metarex.

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:57.217
The big one's out of commission,

00:01:57.217 --> 00:01:59.386
and the Planet Egg's going
back where it belongs.

00:01:59.386 --> 00:02:00.787
Thanks to Sonic!

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:02.923
Yeah, he was incredible!

00:02:02.923 --> 00:02:05.025
He's a real knockout!

00:02:05.025 --> 00:02:06.460
Wait a second...

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.729
Why isn't he coming
back to the ship?

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.529
Oh!

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:10.664
Huh?

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:13.433
Hm.

00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:17.371
What's wrong?

00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:20.474
The cannon that launched Sonic
out of the ship worked great.

00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:21.642
[Laughing nervously]

00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:23.810
Unfortunately, we
launched him too hard,

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.713
and he couldn't get out of his spin
in time to get back to the ship.

00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:29.616
Looks like he's headed
straight for the planet.

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:32.152
It's too bad he's not
packin' a parachute.

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:34.488
AMY: Sonic!!!

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:39.893
Go, go, go, go, go

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:42.996
Gotta go fast

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.932
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:51.738
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:53.774
Got ourselves a situation

00:02:53.774 --> 00:02:55.842
Stuck in a new location

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:59.446
Without any explanation

00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:01.515
No talk of relaxation

00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:03.150
Don't, don't, don't

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.951
Don't blink, don't think

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:06.753
Just go, go, go, go

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:08.255
Go, go

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:13.794
Sonic is on the run

00:03:13.794 --> 00:03:15.696
Sonic, he's number one

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:19.399
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:23.070
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.472
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:03:25.472 --> 00:03:27.374
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:29.910
Sonic X

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.845
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.648
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:03:34.648 --> 00:03:35.682
Sonic X

00:03:44.434 --> 00:03:47.370
Wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-whoa!

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.471
Oof!

00:03:48.471 --> 00:03:51.474
[Groan] Man, what a trip.

00:03:51.474 --> 00:03:53.409
I wonder where I-

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:54.110
Huh?

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.945
Ohhh...

00:03:56.946 --> 00:03:58.715
It's Eggman!

00:03:58.715 --> 00:04:00.583
Huh? Oh!

00:04:02.452 --> 00:04:04.654
He found a Chaos Emerald.

00:04:04.654 --> 00:04:07.624
You don't mind if I borrow this
while you're resting, do ya?

00:04:07.624 --> 00:04:09.926
[Chuckling] See ya!

00:04:17.367 --> 00:04:19.802
Blue Spruce is
definitely out of it.

00:04:19.802 --> 00:04:22.705
He was supposed to protect
me <i>and</i> the Planet Egg.

00:04:22.705 --> 00:04:25.875
What am I going to do now?
I'm not built for battle!

00:04:25.875 --> 00:04:27.810
What if that ship comes after me?

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.712
If I don't think of something fast,

00:04:29.712 --> 00:04:31.981
I'm gonna end up a Meta-wreck!

00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:33.216
Huh?

00:04:33.216 --> 00:04:34.784
They did follow me here!

00:04:34.784 --> 00:04:36.419
They're coming for the Planet Egg!

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:37.687
[Monkey noises]

00:04:38.855 --> 00:04:40.023
What should I do?

00:04:40.023 --> 00:04:42.892
I don't want to fight, but I
can't let them put the Egg back!

00:04:42.892 --> 00:04:44.160
[Monkey noises]

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.328
Wait a second...

00:04:45.328 --> 00:04:48.431
Maybe there's a way for me
to fight, without fighting!

00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:50.433
[Evil monkey laughter]

00:04:50.433 --> 00:04:53.569
Move over! I'm going with you!

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:54.971
Stay here, Amy.

00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:56.139
It's not safe.

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:58.508
That smaller Metarex might
be out there somewhere.

00:04:58.508 --> 00:05:00.510
But I have to find Sonic!

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.646
Don't worry, Amy. Knuckles and I
will find him and bring him back.

00:05:03.646 --> 00:05:06.015
Chris needs help fixing the ship.

00:05:06.015 --> 00:05:08.685
Who knows? Maybe Sonic
will show up here!

00:05:08.685 --> 00:05:11.821
Tails is trying to tell you that we
don't want you getting in our way!

00:05:11.821 --> 00:05:12.455
Ah!

00:05:12.455 --> 00:05:14.157
In your way?!

00:05:14.157 --> 00:05:16.192
Come on, Tails. Let's get going.

00:05:16.192 --> 00:05:16.993
Okay...

00:05:16.993 --> 00:05:19.162
Do not take off!

00:05:28.738 --> 00:05:30.673
You'll regret this!

00:05:32.442 --> 00:05:34.377
This is going to be fun.

00:05:35.078 --> 00:05:36.045
[Giggling]

00:05:36.045 --> 00:05:39.115
I love to explore new
places, don't you, Cheese?

00:05:39.115 --> 00:05:40.049
Chao.

00:05:41.551 --> 00:05:43.720
The trees are sad.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.589
It seems the Planet Egg
hasn't been restored yet.

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:49.292
I can't leave here until
I make sure it is.

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:54.130
You mean you're going to go
look for the Planet Egg, Cosmo?

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.131
Yes.

00:05:55.331 --> 00:06:00.003
[Angry huffing]

00:06:00.003 --> 00:06:01.137
Huh?

00:06:02.739 --> 00:06:03.873
Amy?

00:06:03.873 --> 00:06:05.341
Where are you going?

00:06:05.341 --> 00:06:08.578
Where do you think? I'm
gonna go find Sonic!

00:06:08.578 --> 00:06:12.281
But didn't Tails and Knuckles take
the X Tornado to look for him?

00:06:12.281 --> 00:06:15.184
I'm not gonna rely on anybody
else to find Sonic.

00:06:15.184 --> 00:06:17.387
I have to go rescue him myself!

00:06:17.387 --> 00:06:19.722
I won't rest 'til I get him back!

00:06:21.024 --> 00:06:22.358
Wait!

00:06:22.358 --> 00:06:23.693
Amy is right.

00:06:23.693 --> 00:06:26.262
I cannot rely on
anyone else, either.

00:06:26.262 --> 00:06:29.532
I won't rest until I hold
the Planet Egg in my hand.

00:06:29.532 --> 00:06:30.199
Hm.

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:31.234
But-

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:39.208
Oh? Oh? Hm?

00:06:39.208 --> 00:06:41.077
Hey, wait for us, Cosmo!

00:06:41.077 --> 00:06:42.145
Chao!

00:06:48.384 --> 00:06:51.821
Amy? Could you hand me
a micro-circuit, please?

00:06:52.588 --> 00:06:55.258
Huh? Amy? Cosmo?

00:06:59.796 --> 00:07:01.230
Where'd they go?

00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:03.399
[Grunt]

00:07:08.704 --> 00:07:11.607
I can't believe they left the
ship without even telling me!

00:07:13.543 --> 00:07:14.844
It's Chris calling.

00:07:14.844 --> 00:07:16.612
Amy, do you read me?

00:07:18.848 --> 00:07:21.751
They forgot to bring their
com links with them!

00:07:22.318 --> 00:07:24.654
This is the Blue Typhoon
calling the X Tornado.

00:07:24.654 --> 00:07:25.621
Come in.

00:07:25.621 --> 00:07:27.223
X Tornado here.

00:07:27.223 --> 00:07:28.958
What's up, Chris?

00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:32.061
Amy's gone. So are Cream
and Cheese. Cosmo, too.

00:07:32.061 --> 00:07:33.029
Ah!

00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:34.964
Grr. Where'd they go? Sightseeing?

00:07:34.964 --> 00:07:37.900
You'd better keep your eyes out for
them while you're looking for Sonic.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.068
Huh.

00:07:40.603 --> 00:07:41.571
Huh?

00:07:41.571 --> 00:07:43.773
The Chaos Emerald's
reacting to something!

00:07:43.773 --> 00:07:47.376
Yeah! That means there must be
another Chaos Emerald nearby.

00:07:47.376 --> 00:07:48.478
Let's find it!

00:07:48.478 --> 00:07:50.746
Hang on, I'm gonna make a turn.

00:07:50.746 --> 00:07:51.881
Talk to you later, Chris.

00:07:51.881 --> 00:07:53.916
Right now, we're going
Emerald-hunting!

00:07:53.916 --> 00:07:54.584
Hm?

00:07:54.584 --> 00:07:56.185
See ya later!

00:07:56.719 --> 00:07:58.788
Hey, Tails, are ya there?

00:07:58.788 --> 00:08:00.056
Come in!

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:03.459
Great. Sometimes it feels
like I'm talkin' to myself.

00:08:04.694 --> 00:08:07.630
Sonic! Where are you?

00:08:11.701 --> 00:08:12.668
Ah.

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:15.538
Whoa!

00:08:16.439 --> 00:08:17.406
Cosmo!

00:08:17.406 --> 00:08:18.741
Are you okay?

00:08:18.741 --> 00:08:19.842
Chao!

00:08:20.943 --> 00:08:22.111
Chaao!

00:08:22.111 --> 00:08:23.079
Hm.

00:08:26.582 --> 00:08:27.884
I'm fine.

00:08:27.884 --> 00:08:30.052
Maybe you should go back, Cosmo.

00:08:30.052 --> 00:08:31.521
Leave the searching to me.

00:08:31.521 --> 00:08:34.390
Someone as refined as you
doesn't belong out in the wild.

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.325
I'm not turning back.

00:08:36.325 --> 00:08:37.627
Let's keep going.

00:08:37.627 --> 00:08:38.628
Chao.

00:08:39.562 --> 00:08:41.531
If that's what you want...

00:08:42.231 --> 00:08:44.800
I'm tired of running
away from danger.

00:08:46.435 --> 00:08:49.705
[Panting]

00:08:49.705 --> 00:08:50.439
Ah!

00:08:52.008 --> 00:08:53.409
Uh.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:03.386
[Scared cries]

00:09:04.353 --> 00:09:08.391
I'm not going to stand by while the
Metarex destroy another planet.

00:09:14.864 --> 00:09:16.832
It's the Planet Egg.

00:09:16.832 --> 00:09:18.134
That was easy.

00:09:18.134 --> 00:09:21.037
There's something
strange about this.

00:09:21.037 --> 00:09:22.972
What do you mean, Cream?

00:09:22.972 --> 00:09:26.542
How did the Planet Egg land right
in the middle of this clearing?

00:09:26.542 --> 00:09:28.411
That is kinda weird.

00:09:28.411 --> 00:09:30.846
Almost like somebody
wanted us to find it.

00:09:31.814 --> 00:09:33.115
Well, I'm taking it.

00:09:33.115 --> 00:09:35.184
I don't think that's a good idea.

00:09:35.184 --> 00:09:36.652
Maybe you're right, Amy.

00:09:36.652 --> 00:09:38.721
But we have to put it
back where it belongs,

00:09:38.721 --> 00:09:41.057
or this planet is finished.

00:09:46.862 --> 00:09:48.064
Hm.

00:09:52.702 --> 00:09:53.803
[All gasp]

00:09:53.803 --> 00:09:57.807
[All screaming]

00:09:57.807 --> 00:09:59.308
Hey, let us go!

00:09:59.308 --> 00:10:00.276
[Monkey noises]

00:10:00.276 --> 00:10:01.844
Now who's the monkey in the middle?

00:10:01.844 --> 00:10:02.778
[Monkey-ish laughter]

00:10:02.778 --> 00:10:03.846
You again.

00:10:03.846 --> 00:10:06.215
Sorry to leave you hanging,
but I have to leave.

00:10:06.215 --> 00:10:08.217
I'm heading off to
steal your ship now,

00:10:08.217 --> 00:10:11.120
so I can escape with
the Planet Egg.

00:10:13.948 --> 00:10:15.883
You fell right into my trap!

00:10:15.883 --> 00:10:18.285
I bet you didn't suspect
I'd be this cagey!

00:10:18.285 --> 00:10:19.086
Ooh hoo hoo!

00:10:19.086 --> 00:10:21.088
I can't take all
the credit, though.

00:10:21.088 --> 00:10:23.524
My scheme wouldn't have worked
if you weren't so gullible.

00:10:23.524 --> 00:10:25.092
Aughhh!

00:10:25.092 --> 00:10:27.228
Ah! Don't blow your cool.
We'll find a way out.

00:10:27.228 --> 00:10:28.329
[Chuckling]

00:10:28.329 --> 00:10:31.098
Bye-bye! I'll say "hello"
to your friends for you.

00:10:31.098 --> 00:10:33.033
If they're as dim-witted as you,

00:10:33.033 --> 00:10:35.202
I should be doing a
victory dance in no time!

00:10:35.202 --> 00:10:35.903
[Monkey laughter]

00:10:35.903 --> 00:10:38.305
I don't think so, you
miserable monkey!

00:10:38.305 --> 00:10:41.509
Sonic's gonna go ape when
he hears you caught me!

00:10:42.009 --> 00:10:43.444
Don't go ballistic!

00:10:43.444 --> 00:10:45.012
It's all my fault.

00:10:45.012 --> 00:10:47.915
I never should've fallen
for the Planet Egg trap.

00:10:47.915 --> 00:10:50.551
Now we've lost the
Planet Egg, and Sonic.

00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:51.752
[Amy grunting with effort]

00:10:51.752 --> 00:10:52.787
Huh?

00:10:52.787 --> 00:10:55.122
[Continued grunting]

00:10:55.122 --> 00:10:56.557
Don't worry, Cosmo.

00:10:57.091 --> 00:10:59.493
Okay. Thanks, Amy.

00:11:00.094 --> 00:11:02.029
We have to find
Sonic and warn him,

00:11:02.029 --> 00:11:04.231
before that Metarex traps him, too.

00:11:04.231 --> 00:11:06.867
Shouldn't we go back
to the ship, Amy?

00:11:06.867 --> 00:11:09.837
We could call Tails
and Knuckles for help.

00:11:09.837 --> 00:11:10.938
No way!

00:11:10.938 --> 00:11:13.674
I set out to rescue
Sonic all by myself,

00:11:13.674 --> 00:11:15.676
and that's what we're all gonna do!

00:11:15.676 --> 00:11:18.979
I promise to be more
careful from now on.

00:11:18.979 --> 00:11:20.514
We'll never save any planets,

00:11:20.514 --> 00:11:23.284
if I don't stop getting us
into trouble all the time.

00:11:23.284 --> 00:11:25.352
This scene sure looks familiar.

00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:26.287
Huh?

00:11:31.125 --> 00:11:33.627
Looks like another Metarex trap.

00:11:33.627 --> 00:11:34.495
Chao chao!

00:11:34.495 --> 00:11:36.931
Well, we're not gonna let
it trick us a second time,

00:11:36.931 --> 00:11:37.765
are we?

00:11:37.765 --> 00:11:39.834
Would it try the same trap twice?

00:11:39.834 --> 00:11:41.769
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

00:11:41.769 --> 00:11:43.370
No! Cosmo, don't!

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:44.338
Stay back!

00:11:44.338 --> 00:11:46.841
And if it's a trap,
it will only catch me.

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:54.315
Ah!

00:11:55.282 --> 00:11:56.250
Ah!

00:11:57.218 --> 00:11:58.185
Huh?

00:11:59.486 --> 00:12:00.821
[Laughter]

00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:02.590
That makes two for two.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:03.424
Huh?

00:12:03.424 --> 00:12:05.059
Didn't I catch you already?

00:12:05.059 --> 00:12:07.294
How did you escape from your cage?

00:12:07.294 --> 00:12:09.930
Get lost! That's our business!

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.399
You fell for the same trap, twice?

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:15.336
Wow. You're bigger saps
than the trees around here.

00:12:15.569 --> 00:12:17.838
Hmph!!

00:12:19.106 --> 00:12:20.407
Huh?

00:12:20.875 --> 00:12:22.343
You know what to do, Cheese!

00:12:22.343 --> 00:12:23.310
Chao chao!

00:12:24.111 --> 00:12:25.412
Go get him!

00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:26.914
Chaaaaooo!

00:12:26.914 --> 00:12:27.748
Oof!

00:12:28.148 --> 00:12:29.316
Ugh!

00:12:36.924 --> 00:12:37.925
Come on!

00:12:37.925 --> 00:12:40.194
[Panting]

00:12:40.194 --> 00:12:43.097
Maybe we should go
back to the ship, Amy.

00:12:43.097 --> 00:12:45.733
No, Cream. That Metarex
is still on the loose.

00:12:45.733 --> 00:12:48.435
I have to find Sonic and warn him.

00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:52.273
You all must be angry with me after
the trouble I caused you today.

00:12:52.273 --> 00:12:54.208
I'm so focused on
saving the galaxy,

00:12:54.208 --> 00:12:55.976
I can get reckless sometimes.

00:12:55.976 --> 00:12:57.912
You got the Planet Egg.

00:12:57.912 --> 00:13:00.848
I really admire how
you never gave up.

00:13:01.815 --> 00:13:03.350
You do?

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:05.519
I know just how you feel, Cosmo,

00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:07.221
'cause when I think
Sonic's in danger.

00:13:07.221 --> 00:13:10.024
I won't give up 'til
I know he's safe.

00:13:10.024 --> 00:13:12.660
That's why I won't
stop 'til I find him.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:16.130
All right, Amy. Then we
won't give up either.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:17.298
Chao!

00:13:17.298 --> 00:13:19.767
And I'm with you too, Amy.

00:13:19.767 --> 00:13:21.702
And after we find Sonic,

00:13:21.702 --> 00:13:24.104
we can work together to
make sure the Planet Egg

00:13:24.104 --> 00:13:25.306
gets back where it belongs.

00:13:25.306 --> 00:13:26.740
That's great.

00:13:28.208 --> 00:13:30.277
Aah!

00:13:30.277 --> 00:13:31.779

That was too easy!

Huh! Huh! Huh!

00:13:50.497 --> 00:13:52.266
I can't see!

00:13:52.266 --> 00:13:54.268
Haaaaaaaaaaa!

00:14:06.013 --> 00:14:07.648
Hold it right there!

00:14:07.648 --> 00:14:08.515
This way!

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:09.516

I'm on a roll!

Uh!

00:14:24.198 --> 00:14:26.133
Huh?

00:14:26.133 --> 00:14:28.135

I'm taking that
Emerald back, Sonic.

I found it first,
so it belongs to me.

But if I wasn't for the Metarex,

00:15:31.799 --> 00:15:33.067
I'd still have 'em all!

Argh.

gang up against me!

all over for you!

We found the Planet Egg!

Isn't that fantastic?

No way.

What's going on?

making the vegetation grow faster!

It's growing like crazy!

clingy, aren't they?

00:17:23.443 --> 00:17:26.346
[Beeping] Huh?

00:17:26.346 --> 00:17:28.281
This is the Blue Typhoon, over.

00:17:28.281 --> 00:17:32.151
[Everyone screaming]

00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:35.955
Hold on! Calm down, and
try to talk one at a time.

00:17:35.955 --> 00:17:39.859
Bocoe! Start pruning
these plants, now! Uh!

00:17:39.859 --> 00:17:42.195
They are growing too fast, Doctor!

00:17:42.195 --> 00:17:44.197
Cosmo! What's wrong?

00:17:44.197 --> 00:17:48.001
I can't control the
Planet Egg. I'm sorry!

00:17:54.474 --> 00:17:56.209
Hang on, guys!

00:17:56.209 --> 00:17:57.944
Huh? It's Chris!

00:17:57.944 --> 00:17:58.911
Almost!

00:17:58.911 --> 00:17:59.946
[Struggling]

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.881
Ah...! Got it!

00:18:01.881 --> 00:18:03.282
Catch, Sonic!

00:18:03.282 --> 00:18:04.884
Nice work, Tails!

00:18:07.453 --> 00:18:09.389
Sonic! Heads up!

00:18:30.877 --> 00:18:32.879
[All grimacing]

00:18:33.846 --> 00:18:34.814
[Chuckling]

00:18:41.187 --> 00:18:43.589
Whoaaaaa!

00:18:46.159 --> 00:18:47.160
Ha!

00:18:48.361 --> 00:18:49.362
Huh!

00:18:49.362 --> 00:18:52.765
[All struggling]

00:18:52.765 --> 00:18:54.300
Sorry to leave ya hangin'.

00:18:55.835 --> 00:18:56.803
[Gasp]

00:18:58.371 --> 00:19:00.039
ALL: Oh!

00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:13.119
[Pulsing]

00:19:16.355 --> 00:19:17.356
Ah!

00:19:22.361 --> 00:19:23.362
Huh.

00:19:23.362 --> 00:19:25.131
No wonder I don't like gardening.

00:19:25.131 --> 00:19:27.600
What a botanical nightmare.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.068
Get lost, pal.

00:19:29.068 --> 00:19:31.003
- [All grimacing]

00:19:32.138 --> 00:19:35.007
I couldn't stop myself
from tricking you.

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:37.510
I was programmed for
monkey business.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:38.878
I'm really sorry.

00:19:38.878 --> 00:19:40.713
I learned my lesson.

00:19:42.315 --> 00:19:44.851
Hmm...

00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:47.587
Wow, what a beautiful Emerald!

00:19:47.587 --> 00:19:48.554
Huh!

00:19:49.255 --> 00:19:50.356
Huh?

00:19:50.356 --> 00:19:52.558
I'm not that slow, buddy.

00:19:52.558 --> 00:19:53.526
Ah.

00:20:01.634 --> 00:20:02.769
Ah!

00:20:02.769 --> 00:20:04.170
This mission...

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.539
is drivin' me bananas!

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:07.673
Ah!

00:20:25.658 --> 00:20:27.960
Only five more to go!

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.062
I'm sure we'll get them all back.

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:31.464
Huh?

00:20:31.464 --> 00:20:33.466
You think so, Cosmo?

00:20:33.466 --> 00:20:35.067
You bet!

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:37.937
Today I learned that
if we work together,

00:20:37.937 --> 00:20:39.572
anything is possible.

00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:41.040
Chao chao!
