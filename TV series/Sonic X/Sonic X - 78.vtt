00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.702
Last time on Sonic X,

00:00:01.702 --> 00:00:03.604
when plants began
taking over planets,

00:00:03.604 --> 00:00:06.073
it seemed the Metarex were
on the verge of victory.

00:00:06.073 --> 00:00:08.876
But tables soon turned when
the power of the Planet Egg

00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:11.178
came to the aid of
Sonic and his friends.

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:13.580
With his scheme for cosmic
conquest at an end,

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.483
Dark Oak made a last-ditch
move to destroy the galaxy,

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:18.752
squeezing the Planet
Egg in a gravity field

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:20.888
in order to cause an
enormous explosion.

00:00:20.888 --> 00:00:23.657
Sonic and Shadow launched an
attack on the fearsome field,

00:00:23.657 --> 00:00:25.526
but were powerless
to punch through.

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:27.895
With time running out,
Cosmo got a message

00:00:27.895 --> 00:00:30.764
from her mother saying she was the
only hope to stop the Metarex.

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:32.633
Shadow and Sonic watched in wonder

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:35.802
as Cosmo passed through the
gravity field to defy Dark Oak,

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:37.571
but her plan had a price.

00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:39.439
To deliver the galaxy
from destruction,

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:42.743
Tails had to fire the Power Cannon
at the field, and at Cosmo.

00:00:42.743 --> 00:00:44.278
Tails refused,

00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:46.880
so Cosmo explained the blast
would help the seeds of her clan

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.282
spread across space.

00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:51.685
With one shot at saving the
galaxy, did Tails hit his mark?

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:53.186
And what became of Cosmo?

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:55.522
Find out next on Sonic X!

00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:57.824
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:57.824 --> 00:01:00.928
Gotta go fast

00:01:01.562 --> 00:01:03.864
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:09.670
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.705
Got ourselves a situation

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:13.774
Stuck in a new location

00:01:13.774 --> 00:01:17.377
Without any explanation

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:19.446
No talk of relaxation

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:21.081
Don't, don't, don't

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:22.883
Don't blink, don't think

00:01:22.883 --> 00:01:24.685
Just go, go, go, go

00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:26.186
Go, go

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:31.725
Sonic is on the run

00:01:31.725 --> 00:01:33.627
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:33.627 --> 00:01:37.331
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:41.001
-<i>Gotta go fast</i>
-<i>Sonic</i>

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:43.403
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:45.305
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:47.841
Sonic X

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:49.776
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.579
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:53.614
Sonic X

00:02:08.017 --> 00:02:09.419
[All gasp]

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.788
[All gasp]

00:02:11.788 --> 00:02:14.390
[Crying] Oh, no! Cosmo!

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.159
[Crying]

00:02:18.494 --> 00:02:21.397
[Crying]

00:02:22.031 --> 00:02:23.066
Huh?

00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:24.434
Cosmo!

00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:39.782
Earthia was right.

00:02:39.782 --> 00:02:42.418
My thirst for power
destroyed my people,

00:02:42.418 --> 00:02:45.655
and brought nothing but pain
and suffering to the galaxy.

00:02:47.257 --> 00:02:48.224
EARTHIA: Lucas!

00:02:48.224 --> 00:02:49.192
Huh?

00:02:49.192 --> 00:02:51.995
It is over now. The
galaxy is saved.

00:02:51.995 --> 00:02:53.396
Earthia!

00:02:53.396 --> 00:02:55.865
I feared I'd never see you again.

00:02:55.865 --> 00:02:59.002
We have a second chance now, Lucas.

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:02.872
The time has come for all
creatures to live in peace,

00:03:02.872 --> 00:03:05.575
including you and me.

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.824
ALL: Huh.

00:03:23.393 --> 00:03:27.830
[All crying]

00:03:30.833 --> 00:03:33.369
COSMO: Thank you all
for your friendship.

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:36.639
Before I met you, I didn't
believe in myself.

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:39.575
My clan was wiped
out by the Metarex.

00:03:39.575 --> 00:03:43.446
I felt like I was helpless and
couldn't do anything to stop them,

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.983
but because of you, I
learned that I didn't

00:03:46.983 --> 00:03:49.852
have to stand by and watch
the Metarex take over.

00:03:49.852 --> 00:03:54.090
I could do my part to fight
back and help restore my clan.

00:04:02.632 --> 00:04:05.568
I just wanted you to
know that I'm happy now

00:04:05.568 --> 00:04:08.137
because I fulfilled my destiny.

00:04:08.871 --> 00:04:12.475
Remember, I'll always be with you.

00:04:13.976 --> 00:04:16.245
Don't be sad, Tails.

00:04:16.245 --> 00:04:18.548
Huh?

00:04:18.548 --> 00:04:23.186
Whenever you miss me, just look
for me right here beside you.

00:04:23.186 --> 00:04:25.121
Ah.

00:04:25.822 --> 00:04:27.056
[Kiss]

00:04:45.875 --> 00:04:47.443
Goodbye, Cosmo.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.648
[Grunting]

00:04:52.648 --> 00:04:53.783
Chaos...

00:04:53.783 --> 00:04:55.885
Control!

00:05:05.395 --> 00:05:07.830
The seeds of my clan will
spread through the galaxy

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.032
and find places to grow.

00:05:10.032 --> 00:05:14.871
I'm at peace now...

00:05:15.605 --> 00:05:17.039
Goodbye.

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.775
No! No!

00:05:19.776 --> 00:05:21.978
The Planet Egg is about
to release its power!

00:05:21.978 --> 00:05:23.413
We have to get out of here!

00:05:23.413 --> 00:05:25.481
Activate emergency Egg Drive!

00:05:25.481 --> 00:05:28.151
It is impossible for us
to go into warp space.

00:05:28.151 --> 00:05:31.053
Nothing on this ship is working,
including the engines.

00:05:31.053 --> 00:05:33.790
We don't have power, remember?

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.291
Oh yeah. I forgot.

00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:37.093
It slipped my master mind.

00:05:37.093 --> 00:05:38.528
[All laughing]

00:05:38.528 --> 00:05:39.796
Huh?

00:05:39.796 --> 00:05:42.465
If the Planet Egg lets
out all its energy,

00:05:42.465 --> 00:05:45.601
the others won't have
enough time to get away.

00:05:45.601 --> 00:05:47.537
I have to move.

00:05:47.537 --> 00:05:48.538
Chaos

00:05:48.538 --> 00:05:50.506
[Grunting]

00:05:50.506 --> 00:05:51.874
Aaah!

00:05:52.675 --> 00:05:54.277
Hold on, Shadow!

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.583
Whoa-oa-oa!

00:06:00.583 --> 00:06:03.119
Sorry, friend, but I'm taking over.

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:06.956
After all, we wouldn't want you
to hurt yourself, now would we?

00:06:08.624 --> 00:06:11.861
Chaos Control!

00:06:24.941 --> 00:06:27.877
Hey, what just happened?

00:06:27.877 --> 00:06:29.779
Where's Shadow?

00:06:30.947 --> 00:06:32.882
He's gone.

00:06:35.785 --> 00:06:37.720
BOKKUN: Whoa! Is that a star?

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.990
DECOE: I do not think so,
but what is it, Dr. Eggman?

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.428
I'm not sure, but it appears that
Shadow has stopped time in that spot.

00:06:45.428 --> 00:06:47.864
BOCOE: What do you think
happened to Shadow?

00:06:48.331 --> 00:06:49.665
Who knows?

00:06:49.665 --> 00:06:51.701
He just made a risky move,

00:06:51.701 --> 00:06:55.204
and unfortunately, it
may have been his last.

00:06:55.204 --> 00:06:57.139
He used Chaos Control.

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:01.010
It must have taken all the
energy that he had left.

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.745
Shadow...

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.449
[Crying]

00:07:15.591 --> 00:07:16.826
Huh?

00:07:17.193 --> 00:07:18.761
Sonic?

00:07:21.097 --> 00:07:26.469
Uh... Sonic, I know
you're mad at me, but I-

00:07:27.136 --> 00:07:27.803
Huh?

00:07:27.803 --> 00:07:29.238
Here, Tails.

00:07:29.739 --> 00:07:30.806
Sorry.

00:07:31.774 --> 00:07:34.677
I looked for Cosmo, but
this is all I found.

00:07:36.345 --> 00:07:37.847
A seed?

00:07:38.414 --> 00:07:43.853
[Crying]

00:07:44.253 --> 00:07:46.756
Oh, Sonic!

00:07:46.756 --> 00:07:48.691
Why did this have to happen?

00:07:48.691 --> 00:07:50.192
[Crying]

00:07:50.192 --> 00:07:52.528
It's... just not fair!

00:07:53.829 --> 00:07:56.332
Now I'll never see her again!

00:07:56.332 --> 00:07:57.533
[Sobbing]

00:07:57.533 --> 00:08:00.436
She was... she was my friend!

00:08:01.404 --> 00:08:03.039
I miss her.

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:05.641
She can't be gone!

00:08:05.641 --> 00:08:14.116
[Sobbing]

00:08:16.052 --> 00:08:17.987
BOKKUN: It's amazing!

00:08:17.987 --> 00:08:19.922
DECOE: Those are all Planet Eggs.

00:08:19.922 --> 00:08:22.825
BOCOE: There must be thousands,
or millions of them!

00:08:25.261 --> 00:08:27.463
BOKKUN: But where
are they going to?

00:08:28.097 --> 00:08:31.867
They are all returning home...
to the planets they came from.

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:35.571
Quick, take a picture
of me with them!

00:08:35.571 --> 00:08:36.405
Impossible!

00:08:36.405 --> 00:08:38.074
The camera batteries
are completely drained.

00:08:38.074 --> 00:08:40.476
You even used the
batteries on Sonic?

00:08:40.476 --> 00:08:42.878
We were told to send all
power to the Blue Typhoon.

00:08:42.878 --> 00:08:44.480
Yeah, we just followed orders.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.247
Tinheads!

00:08:45.247 --> 00:08:46.616
How dare you?!

00:08:46.616 --> 00:08:50.119
DR. EGGMAN: Quit bickering and get to
work restoring power to the Egg Drive!

00:08:50.119 --> 00:08:51.654
Right away, Doctor!

00:08:53.963 --> 00:08:57.534
After we defeated the Metarex,
we finally went back home--

00:08:57.534 --> 00:08:59.369
to Sonic's planet, that is.

00:08:59.369 --> 00:09:03.239
It was good to rest up and relax
after all the battles we fought.

00:09:03.239 --> 00:09:07.110
I guess you do deserve a little
vacation after saving the galaxy.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.712
This was the first time
we'd really taken it easy

00:09:09.712 --> 00:09:11.981
since I had transported
myself here.

00:09:11.981 --> 00:09:15.118
It seemed like a long time had
passed since I'd left the lab...

00:09:15.118 --> 00:09:17.187
almost like it was a dream.

00:09:17.187 --> 00:09:19.322
We had a lot of fun
during those days,

00:09:19.322 --> 00:09:21.624
but I couldn't stop thinking
of my family and friends

00:09:21.624 --> 00:09:23.459
I'd left back in my own world.

00:09:23.459 --> 00:09:26.129
And none of us would ever
forget the brave friend

00:09:26.129 --> 00:09:29.365
we lost during our final
fight with Dark Oak.

00:09:34.204 --> 00:09:35.905
[Whoosh]

00:09:43.713 --> 00:09:44.681
Hmm.

00:09:52.922 --> 00:09:55.725
The Master Emerald should
return to its normal state

00:09:55.725 --> 00:09:57.560
once its power is restored.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.329
Will you do your chant?

00:09:59.329 --> 00:10:02.865
Please hear me, oh Master
Emerald, and be restored now!

00:10:02.865 --> 00:10:03.766
Like that?

00:10:03.766 --> 00:10:05.868
[Chuckling] Yeah, your
chant is pretty funny.

00:10:05.868 --> 00:10:07.337
Uh, I didn't mean that.

00:10:07.337 --> 00:10:08.972
No offense taken.

00:10:09.439 --> 00:10:11.941
I think I'll let nature
take its course.

00:10:11.941 --> 00:10:15.845
The Master Emerald helped save the
galaxy, so it needs time to heal.

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.583
In the meantime, I decided...

00:10:21.551 --> 00:10:24.120
to kick back and take it easy.

00:10:24.587 --> 00:10:27.023
We deserve a rest, too, Chris.

00:10:27.023 --> 00:10:28.825
I guess so.

00:10:33.062 --> 00:10:34.998
Since it looks like I'm
gonna be staying here,

00:10:34.998 --> 00:10:37.900
I was wondering how I could go
about building myself a house.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.535
Huh? What do you mean "how?"

00:10:39.535 --> 00:10:41.404
You just go ahead and build it.

00:10:41.404 --> 00:10:44.774
You make it sound so easy,
but it's not so simple.

00:10:44.774 --> 00:10:47.910
There's a lot to think about,
like where would I build it?

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.145
What do you mean "where?"

00:10:49.145 --> 00:10:51.080
There's tons of land
all around you.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.415
Just pick a spot.

00:10:52.415 --> 00:10:54.817
What if that spot belongs
to someone else?

00:10:54.817 --> 00:10:57.086
In our world, it's first
come, first served.

00:10:57.086 --> 00:10:58.488
[Laughing]

00:10:58.488 --> 00:10:59.522
Hm?

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:01.524
Hey!

00:11:01.524 --> 00:11:04.027
You're not planning
on building one here?!

00:11:04.027 --> 00:11:06.262
Well, I figured around
these old ruins

00:11:06.262 --> 00:11:08.298
was about as good a place as any.

00:11:08.298 --> 00:11:10.366
It's kind of pretty, you know?

00:11:10.366 --> 00:11:11.534
Sure, its pretty.

00:11:11.534 --> 00:11:13.670
You go right ahead and build.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.505
It's just lucky your
good friend Knuckles

00:11:15.505 --> 00:11:17.540
didn't have this spot
picked out for his place.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.109
[Laughing] Yeah, lucky!

00:11:20.109 --> 00:11:21.844
That was a hint, kid.

00:11:21.844 --> 00:11:23.413
Hey, Knuckles,

00:11:23.413 --> 00:11:26.749
I'm really happy for all you
guys, being home and all.

00:11:26.749 --> 00:11:29.719
Yeah, it sure is nice.

00:11:42.765 --> 00:11:44.033
DR. EGGMAN: I can't believe it.

00:11:44.033 --> 00:11:44.934
Huh?

00:11:44.934 --> 00:11:47.003
You're worried about
Shadow, aren't you?

00:11:47.003 --> 00:11:48.471
Of course not.

00:11:48.471 --> 00:11:51.541
I don't give a hoot what
happened to that hedgehog.

00:11:52.008 --> 00:11:53.409
Is that so?

00:11:53.409 --> 00:11:56.012
Well, I'm not at all
concerned about Shadow.

00:11:56.012 --> 00:11:58.781
He was designed to be the ultimate
creature by my grandfather,

00:11:58.781 --> 00:12:02.318
Dr. Robotnik, who was almost
as great a genius as me!

00:12:03.553 --> 00:12:05.822
So, where do you think he is?

00:12:06.189 --> 00:12:07.757
Hmm.

00:12:08.691 --> 00:12:09.659
Hmm.

00:12:09.659 --> 00:12:11.561
He knows something.

00:12:12.328 --> 00:12:15.064
Well, Rouge, it's time
for me to bust a move.

00:12:17.467 --> 00:12:18.401
[Grunt]

00:12:19.702 --> 00:12:22.171
I'm going to scrap this ship soon.

00:12:22.171 --> 00:12:24.674
I suggest you find new
living arrangements.

00:12:29.812 --> 00:12:31.147
Hey, Chris!

00:12:31.147 --> 00:12:32.548
I've got something for you!

00:12:32.548 --> 00:12:34.617
If it's from Eggman,
I don't want it.

00:12:34.617 --> 00:12:35.952
[Laughing]

00:12:35.952 --> 00:12:37.220
How'd you know?

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.423
I think this is my most
explosive delivery ever.

00:12:40.423 --> 00:12:42.191
You'll get a real bang out of it.

00:12:42.191 --> 00:12:43.359
Here. Oh?

00:12:43.359 --> 00:12:44.994
BOKUN: Come on out here!
CHRIS: No way.

00:12:44.994 --> 00:12:47.597
But, Chris, I promise
it's not a trick.

00:12:47.597 --> 00:12:50.500
Dr. Eggman's sending you a present.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:51.834
Really?

00:12:59.175 --> 00:13:03.579
COSMO: Sonic, send a message
to all of my wonderful friends.

00:13:03.579 --> 00:13:07.483
Tell them I'm all right.
I am with my mother.

00:13:07.483 --> 00:13:09.419
We have found a new home,

00:13:09.419 --> 00:13:12.321
filled with peace and tranquility.

00:13:12.321 --> 00:13:16.225
Harmony reigns here, and
we are as one with nature.

00:13:16.225 --> 00:13:19.395
Tell them all that they
are noble and good,

00:13:19.395 --> 00:13:23.299
and that because of them, the
darkness has been vanquished.

00:13:25.334 --> 00:13:28.938
Tell Tails to look to
the trees and the sky.

00:13:28.938 --> 00:13:30.907
That is where I will be.

00:13:30.907 --> 00:13:32.308
I'll tell him.

00:13:34.043 --> 00:13:37.413
And hey, I know I'm not much
for getting mushy or anything,

00:13:37.413 --> 00:13:39.215
but I want you to know, Cosmo,

00:13:40.049 --> 00:13:42.718
it was sure great
having you around.

00:13:48.825 --> 00:13:51.093
Goodbye, Sonic.

00:13:51.093 --> 00:13:52.562
Goodbye.

00:14:05.055 --> 00:14:06.957
[Laughter]

00:14:06.957 --> 00:14:07.892
Huh.

00:14:08.626 --> 00:14:10.428
What's this all about, Eggman?

00:14:10.428 --> 00:14:12.863
It's exactly what I wrote there.

00:14:12.863 --> 00:14:15.166
I assume that you
read it, didn't you?

00:14:15.166 --> 00:14:16.534
Sure.

00:14:16.534 --> 00:14:19.170
It says it's a one-way ticket home.

00:14:19.737 --> 00:14:23.674
Never underestimate the superiority
of Dr. Eggman's intellect.

00:14:23.674 --> 00:14:26.710
He gave his brain cells
a real workout this time.

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:29.213
Uh, you mean this ship?

00:14:29.213 --> 00:14:32.283
Yes, it will instantly transport
you back to your own world.

00:14:32.283 --> 00:14:34.685
This will be its first
and only voyage.

00:14:34.685 --> 00:14:37.588
ALL: So pack your duds,
and let's blast off!

00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:41.459
DR. EGGMAN: There's only enough
power in its engines for one trip.

00:14:41.459 --> 00:14:43.727
After that, the machine
will be useless,

00:14:43.727 --> 00:14:46.630
but it should be adequate
to return you to your world.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:49.967
I can't believe you went to all
this trouble just for me, Doctor.

00:14:49.967 --> 00:14:50.768
[Chuckling]

00:14:50.768 --> 00:14:52.336
Don't thank me yet, kid.

00:14:52.336 --> 00:14:55.673
Once you learn the full story,
you may not want to go.

00:14:55.673 --> 00:14:56.707
Huh?

00:14:56.707 --> 00:15:00.578
I'm absolutely certain it will
return you to your planet,

00:15:00.578 --> 00:15:04.548
but I have no idea how old your
body will be when you get there.

00:15:04.548 --> 00:15:06.951
I have confidence in you, Doctor.

00:15:06.951 --> 00:15:08.285
I'll take that chance.

00:15:08.285 --> 00:15:10.955
But you only have a
three minute window.

00:15:10.955 --> 00:15:12.990
DECOE: That isn't
much time, Doctor.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:16.327
BOCOE: Can't you make it three days
so we can throw him a goodbye party?

00:15:16.327 --> 00:15:17.728
Impossible.

00:15:18.762 --> 00:15:21.165
The quantum alignment that
makes travel possible

00:15:21.165 --> 00:15:23.868
between our worlds will only
last for three more minutes.

00:15:23.868 --> 00:15:26.770
This is the only time
when travel can occur.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:28.672
After that, Chris
would be stuck here.

00:15:28.672 --> 00:15:30.140
Can I return?

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.809
It's difficult to say.

00:15:31.809 --> 00:15:34.445
I'm not sure when the
alignment will reoccur.

00:15:34.445 --> 00:15:37.915
It could be in a week,
or not for 10,000 years.

00:15:37.915 --> 00:15:40.818
You mean the fact that I was able
to travel here was just a fluke,

00:15:40.818 --> 00:15:42.586
and I may not be able to come back?

00:15:42.586 --> 00:15:44.121
It would appear so.

00:15:44.121 --> 00:15:46.457
The universe has its
own set of cycles.

00:15:46.457 --> 00:15:50.094
No matter how advanced our technology
is, we can't change that.

00:15:50.661 --> 00:15:51.695
I see.

00:15:51.695 --> 00:15:54.098
So then I guess this
is goodbye, Doctor.

00:15:54.098 --> 00:15:57.468
You've been a terrific
ally, and a worthy enemy.

00:15:57.468 --> 00:15:58.669
Good luck.

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:01.272
You could stay here
with us, you know?

00:16:01.272 --> 00:16:04.475
I'm sure Dr. Eggman would offer
you a job if you asked him.

00:16:04.475 --> 00:16:06.944
We could always use
good help around here!

00:16:06.944 --> 00:16:08.412
DECOE: Take care, Chris!

00:16:08.412 --> 00:16:10.581
BOCOE: Say hello to
your family for us.

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:15.819
All right, then, I'll tell Sonic
and the rest of your pals

00:16:15.819 --> 00:16:18.389
you were smiling
when you left here!

00:16:18.923 --> 00:16:20.324
Are you sure you wanna go?

00:16:20.324 --> 00:16:23.594
That's too bad. We just
got to be friends!

00:16:24.161 --> 00:16:29.867
[Crying] Goodbye!

00:16:29.867 --> 00:16:31.569
[Crying]

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:42.012
I wish I didn't have
to rush off like this.

00:16:42.012 --> 00:16:44.148
I hope the others
don't get mad at me.

00:16:44.148 --> 00:16:46.283
KNUCKLES: I sure am
gonna miss that kid.

00:16:46.283 --> 00:16:47.418
AMY: Me too.

00:16:47.418 --> 00:16:50.354
CREAM: He didn't even say goodbye.

00:16:50.354 --> 00:16:52.156
TAILS: I'm sure he wanted to,

00:16:52.156 --> 00:16:54.391
but maybe he didn't
have enough time.

00:16:54.391 --> 00:16:56.527
Goodbye, everybody.

00:16:56.527 --> 00:16:57.595
Goodbye.

00:16:59.129 --> 00:17:00.664
Mmm.

00:17:04.802 --> 00:17:05.936
Huh?

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.076
I'll be seeing ya, Chris!

00:17:12.643 --> 00:17:14.578
[Crying] Goodbye...

00:17:14.578 --> 00:17:18.449
[Crying] Sonic.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:28.559
[Grunting]

00:17:31.996 --> 00:17:32.963
Sonic...

00:17:47.111 --> 00:17:50.114
ALL: Oh!

00:17:50.114 --> 00:17:54.451
[Evil chuckle]

00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:57.888
Now that Sonic's team is down by
one annoying little pipsqueak,

00:17:57.888 --> 00:18:01.358
we can finally get back to
building the Eggman Empire!

00:18:02.092 --> 00:18:04.028
ALL: All right!

00:18:07.798 --> 00:18:11.101
Eggman better not touch
the Master Emerald.

00:18:11.101 --> 00:18:13.070
I have to go warn Sonic.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.543
Come on, Cheese, our
friends need our help!

00:18:19.543 --> 00:18:20.744
Chao!

00:18:22.413 --> 00:18:24.348
I guess I'll join in, too.

00:18:24.348 --> 00:18:26.884
This team could use
a little glamour.

00:18:27.551 --> 00:18:30.354
Time to rev up the
X Tornado, you guys.

00:18:32.289 --> 00:18:35.359
Life never stays slow
around here for long.

00:18:35.359 --> 00:18:36.326
Thank goodness.

00:18:36.326 --> 00:18:37.494
Watch out, Eggman!

00:18:37.494 --> 00:18:39.830
I'm coming at ya, full speed!
