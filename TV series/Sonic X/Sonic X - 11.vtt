00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:49.883
What's going on?

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:51.184
What's wrong?

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:54.421
How could anybody get in there?

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:58.625
Ahh!

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:00.227
Hyah!

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:08.969
Hello, gorgeous.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.705
We'll lock down the place.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.149
Nobody's getting out
of here now!

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:24.751
[Laughs]

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.625
Hands in the air!

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:47.474
"Thank you"?

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:50.877
What?
Is this a gag?

00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:10.964
You may not be a Chaos Emerald,
but you'll do for now.

00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:17.137
Go, go, go, go, go

I'm coming to you live
from the National Museum,

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.656
where the world's
largest diamond

00:03:22.756 --> 00:03:24.324
was stolen late last night.

00:03:24.457 --> 00:03:26.426
Law enforcement authorities
are baffled

00:03:26.526 --> 00:03:28.662
by the outbreak
of precious-gem robberies,

00:03:28.762 --> 00:03:31.531
but private sources tell SS TV
that they believe

00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:34.801
this was merely the biggest
in a series of jewel thefts

00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:37.404
that have plagued
Station Square in recent days.

00:03:37.504 --> 00:03:40.340
This is Scarlet Garcia,
SS TV news.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.776
Hey, Cream, have you seen Sonic?

00:03:42.876 --> 00:03:45.545
The last time we saw him,
he was with Chris and Tails,

00:03:45.645 --> 00:03:47.180
but I'm not sure
where they went.

00:03:47.313 --> 00:03:48.381
Chao!

00:03:48.515 --> 00:03:49.549
That's too bad.

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:51.851
Hey, feel like having
some pizza?

00:03:51.951 --> 00:03:53.820
Yes.
Are you sure it's okay?

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.388
You bet it is!

00:03:55.522 --> 00:03:57.023
Sonic's loss is your gain.

00:03:57.123 --> 00:03:59.025
- Yay!
- Yay!

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.932
Tails, you see anything
down there?

00:04:06.032 --> 00:04:07.534
No.

00:04:12.572 --> 00:04:14.074
Nothing there.

00:04:14.174 --> 00:04:15.308
Don't worry.

00:04:15.408 --> 00:04:17.577
We're gonna find those emeralds.

00:04:17.677 --> 00:04:20.046
And Sonic will help, right?

00:04:21.114 --> 00:04:22.549
Uh, Sonic?

00:04:22.649 --> 00:04:24.117
Uh, what?

00:04:24.217 --> 00:04:26.653
Where are you?

00:04:30.557 --> 00:04:32.358
Something has to be done,
gentlemen.

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:34.027
We must take action.

00:04:34.127 --> 00:04:36.429
Eggman is a threat
to our nation's security.

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:38.598
We've no choice
but to launch an attack.

00:04:38.698 --> 00:04:42.001
Mr. President, I want to stop
this Eggman as much as you do,

00:04:42.102 --> 00:04:43.603
but it's not so simple.

00:04:43.703 --> 00:04:46.272
I'm afraid the chairman
is right, sir.

00:04:46.372 --> 00:04:49.075
After examining the remnants
of one of Eggman's robots,

00:04:49.175 --> 00:04:51.411
we've determined
his technical capabilities

00:04:51.544 --> 00:04:52.612
and military hardware

00:04:52.746 --> 00:04:54.848
far surpass our current
weapons system.

00:04:54.948 --> 00:04:56.116
That may be so,

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:59.052
but it doesn't change the fact
that something must be done.

00:04:59.152 --> 00:05:01.855
Would you consider
asking Sonic to assist?

00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:03.857
Sonic?

00:05:03.957 --> 00:05:05.592
Eggman's an unusual enemy, sir,

00:05:05.692 --> 00:05:07.727
and that calls
for an unusual ally.

00:05:07.827 --> 00:05:08.728
With this in mind,

00:05:08.828 --> 00:05:11.598
I think Sonic's got what it
takes to get the best of him.

00:05:11.698 --> 00:05:15.935
He just might be the only hope
we have, Mr. President.

00:05:16.035 --> 00:05:17.570
That's true.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.607
But how do we know we can even
communicate with a hedgehog?

00:05:20.707 --> 00:05:23.376
Our operatives observed him
speaking to the boy

00:05:23.476 --> 00:05:24.410
he's staying with.

00:05:24.544 --> 00:05:26.846
He understands the language.

00:05:28.148 --> 00:05:30.116
Fine.
Then we'll do it.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.553
Sir, I think you've made
the right decision.

00:05:34.187 --> 00:05:36.723

I'm gonna draw a star.

00:05:38.792 --> 00:05:40.560
GIRL #2:
I don't know.

00:05:41.294 --> 00:05:43.763
Hey, I bet that's
that Chaos Emerald

00:05:43.863 --> 00:05:45.865
you and Sonic
have been trying to find.

00:05:45.965 --> 00:05:47.934
- Right, Chris?
- Kinda.

00:05:48.034 --> 00:05:49.903
It looks like that?

00:05:50.003 --> 00:05:53.206
Let's keep the chatting to a
minimum and focus on painting.

00:05:53.306 --> 00:05:55.441
TOGETHER:
Uh, right.

00:05:56.042 --> 00:05:58.344
What's that you're painting,
Chris?

00:05:58.444 --> 00:05:59.846
An emerald.

00:06:00.947 --> 00:06:03.583
But I thought all emeralds
were supposed to be green.

00:06:03.716 --> 00:06:05.718
You're right!
Funny, huh?

00:06:05.852 --> 00:06:07.620
I'll just start over.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.990
No, Chris, your emerald can be
any color you want it to be.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.058
Matter of fact,

00:06:12.158 --> 00:06:14.694
I heard a red emerald was found
somewhere recently

00:06:14.794 --> 00:06:16.095
around Silky Heights.

00:06:16.196 --> 00:06:17.831
What?

00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:18.832
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:06:18.932 --> 00:06:20.967
Uh, sorry.

00:06:21.067 --> 00:06:22.535
In fact, if I'm not mistaken,

00:06:22.635 --> 00:06:25.405
they found that emerald
in an old, dilapidated factory

00:06:25.505 --> 00:06:27.774
not too long ago.

00:06:28.675 --> 00:06:31.211
Who knows what interesting
tidbits you can pick up

00:06:31.344 --> 00:06:34.514
if you hang around long enough.

Hey!

00:06:54.901 --> 00:06:56.236
Where's Sonic?

00:06:56.336 --> 00:07:00.240
He left already, and it's
about time I head out, too.

00:07:08.114 --> 00:07:09.515
Let's take off!

00:07:17.957 --> 00:07:19.692
Hmm.

00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:28.301
That way?
Huh?

00:07:30.403 --> 00:07:31.905
All right!

00:07:32.005 --> 00:07:34.407
Yeah, this is
the coolest thing ever!

00:07:34.507 --> 00:07:37.310
Okay, cool it, will you, Danny?

00:07:38.144 --> 00:07:40.313
Look, there's Sonic!

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.593
Ha! They fell for it.

00:07:57.563 --> 00:07:58.331
Ahh!

That's it.

00:08:09.309 --> 00:08:12.612
Now to see if I can find
another emerald.

00:08:31.798 --> 00:08:33.733
Well, what's this?

00:08:43.009 --> 00:08:44.277
My, my!

being in the spotlight.

That's right.

You snuck into
the National Museum

00:09:28.221 --> 00:09:30.223
and stole that diamond.

00:09:30.323 --> 00:09:31.958
Who, me?

00:09:32.058 --> 00:09:33.860
We set up a trap to catch Sonic,

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.229
and who do we wind up with
but a jewel thief.

00:09:36.329 --> 00:09:39.165
Funny how things work out
that way.

for a cup of coffee.

What?
Listen, missy!

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.895
This isn't a country club.

is a cup of coffee.

A nag, huh?

Hey, get her a coffee, Topaz.

00:10:16.641 --> 00:10:18.610
Hmph!
Aye, aye!

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.583
She doesn't deserve it,
if you ask me.

why we've brought you here
today.

Uh-huh.

00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:57.015
Listen, Rouge,
we'd like to make a deal.

00:10:57.115 --> 00:10:59.017
A deal?

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:02.120
We are willing to offer you
complete immunity.

00:11:02.254 --> 00:11:05.056
That is, of course, if you
decide to join our team.

00:11:05.156 --> 00:11:06.691
Join your team?

00:11:06.825 --> 00:11:08.059
As what?

00:11:08.159 --> 00:11:12.030
You'll work as an undercover
agent for the president.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.164
Wow!

00:11:13.265 --> 00:11:16.301
Imagine me a real,
live secret agent.

00:11:16.401 --> 00:11:19.004
Why would you want
a naughty little jewel thief

00:11:19.104 --> 00:11:20.538
like me on your team?

00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:23.475
That is none of your business,
young lady!

00:11:23.575 --> 00:11:24.542
Do we have a deal?

00:11:24.643 --> 00:11:26.811
Um...

00:11:26.911 --> 00:11:27.912
[Thinking]
Who knows?

00:11:28.013 --> 00:11:28.913
Working as an agent,

00:11:29.014 --> 00:11:32.250
I just might get closer
to the Chaos Emerald.

00:11:32.384 --> 00:11:35.086
Mr. Pres,
you got yourself a deal.

00:11:35.186 --> 00:11:36.821
Congratulations, agent.

00:11:36.955 --> 00:11:37.922
Welcome aboard.

00:11:38.056 --> 00:11:39.090
[Laughs]

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:44.296
Does this mean
I can't keep my diamond?

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.499
Ah, right.
Well, what do you think?

00:11:47.599 --> 00:11:49.801
Well, the case is still
considered unsolved,

00:11:49.901 --> 00:11:52.103
as long as she promises
not to talk.

00:11:52.203 --> 00:11:54.005
There you have it.

00:11:54.105 --> 00:11:55.640
Mmm!

00:11:58.576 --> 00:11:59.978
Hmm.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.182
I'll have to take my chances.

00:12:20.665 --> 00:12:22.300
What's this thing?

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.702
That is a bomb.

00:12:23.802 --> 00:12:25.537
A bomb?

00:12:25.637 --> 00:12:28.940
If we push this remote control,
it's bye-bye batty.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.742
See, we don't exactly trust you.

00:12:30.842 --> 00:12:33.945
So you be a good little girl and
maybe we won't have to use it.

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:35.113
Huh!

00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:36.981
Just think of it as a bracelet.

00:12:37.082 --> 00:12:38.917
A bracelet that explodes.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:42.020
It's supposed to be functional,
not fashionable.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.456
Looks like something
an old lady would wear.

00:12:44.556 --> 00:12:45.990
Why don't you try it on?

00:12:46.091 --> 00:12:47.959
What does that mean?

00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:49.961
Just what you think it does,
Grandma.

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:52.497
Ladies, please!

00:12:53.031 --> 00:12:55.934
Approaching drop point,
Commander, straight ahead.

00:12:56.034 --> 00:12:57.602
Yep, Roger.

00:12:57.702 --> 00:12:58.937
Get ready.

00:13:11.583 --> 00:13:13.752
AMY:
What is this place?

00:13:13.885 --> 00:13:16.588
It gives me the creeps.

00:13:16.721 --> 00:13:18.490
Well, now what?
There's nothing here.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.759
Something seems strange here,
Sonic.

00:13:20.859 --> 00:13:22.460
Who would have moved that sign?

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.561
Beats me.

00:13:23.661 --> 00:13:26.664
- [Snoring]
- [Yawns]

00:13:36.474 --> 00:13:39.878
I don't see an entrance
anywhere.

00:13:39.978 --> 00:13:41.079
Come on!

00:13:41.179 --> 00:13:42.580
Where is it?

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.915
[Scoffs]

00:13:44.015 --> 00:13:46.418
Do I have to do everything?

00:13:49.854 --> 00:13:51.689
Oh, yeah?

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.224
Hold on!

00:13:53.324 --> 00:13:55.059
Follow me.

00:14:08.273 --> 00:14:09.707
This way.

00:14:09.808 --> 00:14:11.509
Hold on!
Where are you going?

00:14:11.609 --> 00:14:12.944
Don't be so jumpy.

00:14:13.044 --> 00:14:15.313
You want me to help you out
or don't you?

00:14:15.413 --> 00:14:17.382
No funny stuff?

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:19.284
I'm on your team now.

00:14:19.384 --> 00:14:21.886
All right, just checking.

00:14:22.587 --> 00:14:25.190
Okay, let's move in.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.569
[Snoring]

00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:48.813
We don't have much farther.

00:14:48.913 --> 00:14:52.050
Now if we could just find
the power output sector.

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:54.385
Any idea where that might be?

00:14:54.519 --> 00:14:58.022
I guess I must have left
my map at home.

00:14:58.456 --> 00:14:59.858
Well, it's almost dawn.

00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.260
What do you think we should do,
Commander?

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.729
We don't have much time.
Let's keep looking.

00:15:11.069 --> 00:15:12.670
Hmm.

00:15:14.072 --> 00:15:15.707
Commander?

00:15:15.807 --> 00:15:18.309
Mind if I have myself
a little look around?

00:15:18.409 --> 00:15:21.145
Are you kidding?
How do I know I can trust you?

00:15:21.279 --> 00:15:22.046
You can.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.249
I'll be right back.

00:15:24.382 --> 00:15:26.184
I'll go with her just in case.

00:15:26.284 --> 00:15:27.919
[Scoffs]
Whatever!

00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:29.888
All right, then.

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:33.458
Remember.

00:15:33.558 --> 00:15:35.026
Don't do anything reckless.

00:15:35.126 --> 00:15:36.661
- Yes, sir!
- Aye, aye!

00:15:36.761 --> 00:15:38.029
[Growls]

00:15:46.905 --> 00:15:48.940
This could get messy.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.309
Especially
for an old gal like you.

00:16:03.454 --> 00:16:04.989
My, my!

00:16:07.125 --> 00:16:09.527
Well, hello.

00:16:10.728 --> 00:16:12.797
It's beautiful.

00:16:16.701 --> 00:16:19.971
I have the strangest feeling
we're being watched.

00:16:30.081 --> 00:16:31.132
Please help me, Rouge!

00:16:35.887 --> 00:16:37.522
Please help me!

00:16:37.656 --> 00:16:39.291
Hang in, girl.

00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:49.434
[Siren blaring]

00:16:49.534 --> 00:16:50.936
Aah!

00:16:51.036 --> 00:16:52.437
Aah!

00:16:52.537 --> 00:16:53.872
- Ugh!
- Ugh!

00:16:53.972 --> 00:16:55.407
What is that?

00:16:55.507 --> 00:16:56.641
What?

00:16:56.741 --> 00:16:58.343
Ugh!

00:17:00.211 --> 00:17:02.781
It must be intruders.

00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:10.221
That sound.
It hurts my ears!

00:17:15.994 --> 00:17:17.896
[Siren intensifies]

00:17:22.133 --> 00:17:25.170
Aah!

00:17:26.104 --> 00:17:28.273
I can't take it!

00:17:28.373 --> 00:17:30.542
Help me, please!

00:17:30.642 --> 00:17:33.111
That scream is coming
from Noizi!

00:17:33.211 --> 00:17:35.513
Someone's trying to make off
with my Chaos Emerald,

00:17:35.613 --> 00:17:37.582
and we can't have that,
now, can we?

00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:39.584
Go get them, Sneazer!

00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:40.819
Aah!

00:17:40.919 --> 00:17:43.254
Blast that infernal noise!

00:17:47.125 --> 00:17:48.026
Ugh!

00:17:48.126 --> 00:17:50.028
I'll go insane!

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.775
Rouge!
[Gasps]

00:18:06.911 --> 00:18:09.314
The power generator!

00:18:17.188 --> 00:18:19.591
[Siren intensifies]

00:18:19.691 --> 00:18:21.092
Aah!

00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:28.800
I've had enough of this.

00:18:40.345 --> 00:18:41.212
Aah!

00:18:43.281 --> 00:18:44.315
Oh, no!

00:18:44.449 --> 00:18:46.317
I've lost the Chaos Emerald!

00:18:46.418 --> 00:18:47.685
- [Siren blaring]
- Aah!

00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:54.325
All right, you're fooling
with the wrong girl.

00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:55.193
Huh?

00:19:06.805 --> 00:19:09.641
[Blaring stops]

00:19:13.244 --> 00:19:15.046
Push that button!

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.614
Oh!

00:19:19.684 --> 00:19:21.086
Aah!

00:19:34.732 --> 00:19:36.601
Hang on tight.

00:19:42.874 --> 00:19:44.042
Move it!

00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:46.111
Excuse me!
Huh?

00:19:46.211 --> 00:19:48.613
Who's that?
Oh!

00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:52.851
Aah!

00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:10.168
Rouge, I don't know how
to thank you.

00:20:10.268 --> 00:20:11.736
I do.

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:13.304
Lose some weight.

00:20:13.404 --> 00:20:14.405
[Growls]

00:20:14.506 --> 00:20:17.308
[Coughs]

00:20:17.408 --> 00:20:20.411
Help, Mommy!

00:20:24.215 --> 00:20:25.917
[Snoring]

00:20:26.017 --> 00:20:27.418
Uh, Chris?

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:29.220
Danny?

00:20:29.354 --> 00:20:31.422
TOGETHER:
Aah!

00:20:31.523 --> 00:20:32.590
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.760
TOGETHER:
Uh, we're sorry.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.062
Now, Chris, I get the feeling

00:20:38.163 --> 00:20:40.632
you and Danny didn't get enough
sleep last night.

00:20:40.732 --> 00:20:42.367
It's okay to have adventures.

00:20:42.467 --> 00:20:44.636
Just make sure to get
to bed on time.

00:20:44.736 --> 00:20:45.370
Huh?

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:47.505
But how did you know, sir?

00:20:47.605 --> 00:20:49.674
Just a wild guess.

00:20:49.774 --> 00:20:51.676
TOGETHER:
Thanks, Mr. Stewart.

00:20:51.809 --> 00:20:53.912
[Laughter]
