WEBVTT

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:06.172
Hey, Tails.

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:09.809
Why don't you try steering the
ship on a different course now?

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.344
I guess I can.

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:14.347
But where exactly do you
want me to go, Sonic?

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:17.217
Wherever. It doesn't matter.

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:20.320
It's just, we've been going this
direction since the Metarex began

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.489
chasing us twelve hours ago,

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.424
and I've been wondering
why they haven't

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:26.192
fired a shot at us.

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:28.695
Are you suggesting that
the Metarex tricked us

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.063
into going this way?

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:32.566
Is it a trap, Sonic?

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.134
Why don't we find out?

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:35.602
Okay.

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:37.304
And while we're at
it, we can test out

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:39.306
how accurate their
tracking sensors are.

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:40.907
Let's push our speed to the max.

00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:44.778
Chris, increase auxiliary
engines to maximum power.

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:46.980
CHRIS: Roger. Increasing power now.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.915
TAILS: Turn to Mark 3.1.

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:50.617
Are you sure this is a good idea?

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:51.818
They're turning, too!

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:53.320
It's a laser blast.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.821
The Metarex are firing at us.

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:56.756
All shields up.

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:03.663
Guess they don't want
us going this way.

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:06.566
TAILS: Change course to Mark 0.8.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.468
Maintain speed.

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:12.072
AMY: But there are three ships
approaching at Mark 3.70.

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.274
And they're coming
at us full speed!

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:17.811
Quick, target those ships now!

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:18.878
You got it!

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:22.115
Amy, load six missiles and
prepare to fire on my command.

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:23.450
CHRIS: Targets set.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.784
AMY: Missiles are loaded.

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:26.019
TAILS: Fire!

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.065
CHRIS: All three ships
have been destroyed.

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:40.767
Five more are on the way.

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:43.236
TAILS: Return to
original coordinates.

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:44.270
CHRIS: Roger.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.805
TAILS: Now it's their move.

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:47.841
Cream, keep all the shields up.

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:48.775
CREAM: Roger!

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:50.243
If the Metarex back off now,

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:52.245
it's because they want
us to head this way.

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:01.488
The Metarex ships turned around.

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:03.456
They aren't chasing us anymore.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.359
The Metarex are up to something.

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:07.460
Looks that way.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.463
Chris, are there any
Metarex ahead of us?

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:13.366
I've been trying to search
the area with our scanners,

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:15.935
but so far, I've haven't
detected anything at all.

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:19.339
It's possible that somebody's
jamming our scanners.

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:20.507
KNUCKLES: Then it is a trap.

00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:21.441
We should turn around.

00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:22.609
No way.

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:25.445
I'm really curious to know
what the Metarex are scheming.

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:27.147
You want us to stay on course?

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:28.715
That doesn't make any sense, Sonic.

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:31.251
We're bound to get attacked.

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:34.487
That's what I'm hoping for.

00:02:41.127 --> 00:02:42.729
Go, go, go, go, go

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:45.832
Gotta go fast

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:48.735
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:54.574
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:56.609
Got ourselves a situation

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.678
Stuck in a new location

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:02.282
Without any explanation

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:04.350
No talk of relaxation

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.985
Don't, don't, don't

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:07.787
Don't blink, don't think

00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:09.589
Just go, go, go, go

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:11.091
Go, go

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:16.629
Sonic is on the run

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.531
Sonic, he's number one

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:22.202
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:25.905
-<i>Gotta go fast</i>
-<i>Sonic</i>

00:03:25.905 --> 00:03:28.308
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:30.210
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.746
Sonic X

00:03:32.746 --> 00:03:34.681
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:37.484
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:03:37.484 --> 00:03:38.518
Sonic X

00:03:43.395 --> 00:03:47.499
DARK OAK: Send a fleet of battle
ships to destroy Sonic now.

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:50.002
BLACK NARCISSUS: No. I want
to confront him face to face.

00:03:50.002 --> 00:03:52.338
It's much more challenging
and amusing.

00:03:52.338 --> 00:03:55.841
Do not underestimate that
hedgehog and his friends.

00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:59.078
Remember what happened to your
fellow commander, Red Pine?

00:03:59.078 --> 00:04:00.279
[Laughing]

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:01.980
Red Pine was a weak fool.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.251
He did not have the right skills
to defeat Sonic, but I do.

00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:08.554
It's all a matter of brainpower.

00:04:08.554 --> 00:04:11.657
You see, it's impossible to
vanquish a powerful opponent

00:04:11.657 --> 00:04:13.992
unless you understand him.

00:04:13.992 --> 00:04:18.564
I have built two prototype robots
to test the hedgehog's abilities.

00:04:18.564 --> 00:04:20.799
Perhaps they can defeat Sonic.

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.402
If not, I'll use the data
from their attack to

00:04:23.402 --> 00:04:26.071
construct another robot
that will destroy him!

00:04:26.071 --> 00:04:28.540
[Evil laughter]

00:04:32.077 --> 00:04:35.013
TAILS: The scanners picked
up a planet dead ahead.

00:04:35.013 --> 00:04:37.416
AMY: But I thought the Metarex
were jamming our sensors.

00:04:37.416 --> 00:04:39.551
Well, I guess they
changed their mind,

00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:42.788
and decided to stop jamming
them for some reason, Amy.

00:04:42.788 --> 00:04:44.723
Thanks for straightening
that out for us.

00:04:44.723 --> 00:04:48.293
I'll bring a magnified view
up on the main screen.

00:04:48.293 --> 00:04:49.695
That's magnified?

00:04:49.695 --> 00:04:51.730
AMY: We can hardly see anything.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.799
I can make the image bigger.

00:04:53.799 --> 00:04:56.068
I'll just have to
zoom in digitally.

00:04:56.068 --> 00:04:59.938
[Beeping]

00:04:59.938 --> 00:05:03.909
KNUCKLES: Not exactly a prime
piece of real estate, is it?

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:04.710
Huh?

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.779
Hold on! Look at those readings.

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:11.083
The computer analysis shows those
craters were all made recently.

00:05:11.083 --> 00:05:15.654
The Metarex probably kept attacking this
planet until it was totally lifeless.

00:05:15.654 --> 00:05:17.589
Tails is right.

00:05:20.025 --> 00:05:21.260
Mm.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.495
I thought it was a bad
idea to come here,

00:05:23.495 --> 00:05:25.230
but I've changed my mind.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.199
If these Metarex want
to challenge us,

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:28.901
then I say bring 'em on!

00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:31.236
The scanners have
located their base.

00:05:31.236 --> 00:05:35.307
Let's go there and make 'em pay
for what they did to this planet.

00:05:35.908 --> 00:05:38.043
They think they fooled us,

00:05:38.043 --> 00:05:41.146
which will make it even sweeter
when we beat those Metarex.

00:05:41.146 --> 00:05:44.650
Okay, let's go for it!

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.553
Turning off all shields
to increase power.

00:05:47.553 --> 00:05:49.121
We're ready to go!

00:05:52.191 --> 00:05:54.493
[Beeping]

00:05:54.493 --> 00:05:55.828
Huh?

00:05:55.828 --> 00:05:57.296
This can't be right!

00:05:57.296 --> 00:06:00.599
The ship's sensors have detected
a bunch of Chaos Emeralds.

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:02.134
What's going on?

00:06:02.134 --> 00:06:06.772
Didn't you adjust the sensors so you
wouldn't pick up anymore fake Emeralds?

00:06:06.772 --> 00:06:09.041
What makes you think
these Emeralds are fake?

00:06:09.041 --> 00:06:10.242
They could be real.

00:06:10.242 --> 00:06:13.679
There's no way this many
Chaos Emeralds exist.

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:15.814
How many of them are out there?

00:06:15.814 --> 00:06:17.749
About 500.

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:19.952
Whoa. That's a big rock collection.

00:06:19.952 --> 00:06:22.621
It looks like these fake
Chaos Emeralds are a lot more

00:06:22.621 --> 00:06:24.556
advanced than the
others we've seen.

00:06:24.556 --> 00:06:26.558
Those Metarex are
definitely clever.

00:06:26.558 --> 00:06:29.194
But they're also
devious and dangerous.

00:06:29.194 --> 00:06:31.430
Speaking of the Metarex, you guys,

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.032
it looks like they're
sending us a message.

00:06:34.967 --> 00:06:37.569
This is the first time they've
ever sent us a text message.

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:39.371
I'll turn on the translator.

00:06:39.371 --> 00:06:41.907
You don't have to
bother. I can read it.

00:06:41.907 --> 00:06:43.742
"Greetings, space voyagers.

00:06:43.742 --> 00:06:45.277
It was I who sent the Metarex

00:06:45.277 --> 00:06:47.880
to attack your ship
and chase you down.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.916
You were being tested, and
you have passed with honor.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.321
I admire your great courage, and
I invite you to visit my base.

00:06:56.321 --> 00:06:59.625
I am Black Narcissus, a
commander of the Metarex."

00:06:59.625 --> 00:07:02.160
So he's inviting us to his base?

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.463
Let's send him an
RSVP on a missile.

00:07:04.463 --> 00:07:07.366
If we do go to that base,
you should stay on the ship.

00:07:07.366 --> 00:07:09.301
You're much too hot-headed
for this mission.

00:07:09.301 --> 00:07:11.670
What?! I am not a hot-head!

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.438
Oh, yeah?

00:07:13.438 --> 00:07:14.406
She got you!

00:07:14.406 --> 00:07:15.374
There's more.

00:07:15.374 --> 00:07:16.308
Huh.

00:07:16.308 --> 00:07:19.211
Really? What else
does it say, Cosmo?

00:07:19.211 --> 00:07:20.512
I'm all mixed up!

00:07:20.512 --> 00:07:23.081
I meant to say there isn't
anything more to the message!

00:07:23.081 --> 00:07:24.149
Huh?

00:07:24.149 --> 00:07:26.785
Okay, let's go and say hello.

00:07:26.785 --> 00:07:29.621
I doubt the Metarex will invite
us back after we wreck the place.

00:07:29.621 --> 00:07:37.796
[All laughing]

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.163
I hope they'll forgive
me for deceiving them.

00:08:26.812 --> 00:08:28.046
[Alarm sounds]

00:08:28.046 --> 00:08:30.415
The Metarex just
fired missiles at us.

00:08:30.415 --> 00:08:31.984
That isn't a very warm welcome.

00:08:31.984 --> 00:08:32.951
Chao chao!

00:08:32.951 --> 00:08:34.686
CREAM: Sending more power
to the front shields.

00:08:34.686 --> 00:08:37.456
These Metarex are
playing games with us.

00:08:37.456 --> 00:08:40.392
I knew they were sneaky,
but this is a new low.

00:08:40.392 --> 00:08:41.893
Cosmo?

00:08:42.594 --> 00:08:43.562
Oh!

00:08:46.264 --> 00:08:48.200
CREAM: They're coming in fast!

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.369
There's too many of
them to shoot down!

00:08:50.369 --> 00:08:52.304
[Gasp] Hey, Sonic!

00:08:52.871 --> 00:08:54.006
According to the sensors,

00:08:54.006 --> 00:08:57.342
those missiles are packed with
potassium nitrate and aluminum.

00:08:57.342 --> 00:08:59.011
That's weird.

00:08:59.011 --> 00:09:00.112
I don't get it.

00:09:00.112 --> 00:09:02.781
Well, those chemicals
are used in fireworks.

00:09:02.781 --> 00:09:04.316
[All yelp]

00:09:07.853 --> 00:09:11.390
I had a feeling this trip was
gonna blow up in our faces.

00:09:47.926 --> 00:09:50.262
BLACK NARCISSUS: You may
proceed through the tunnel.

00:09:50.262 --> 00:09:51.830
I am waiting for you.

00:09:54.066 --> 00:09:55.701
So you came alone.

00:09:55.701 --> 00:09:57.636
You are braver than I thought.

00:09:57.636 --> 00:09:59.971
I rather suspected that
you would lose your nerve.

00:09:59.971 --> 00:10:01.907
Uh! Where are you?

00:10:01.907 --> 00:10:04.776
Is there some reason why
you're hiding from me?

00:10:04.776 --> 00:10:06.011
Calm yourself.

00:10:06.011 --> 00:10:08.680
You have nothing to fear... so far.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.049
[Chuckling] Welcome to my base.

00:10:12.017 --> 00:10:14.553
You promised to tell me everything.

00:10:14.553 --> 00:10:17.723
I want to know the truth about
my ancestors and the Metarex.

00:10:17.723 --> 00:10:20.325
You tell me now, or I'm leaving!

00:10:20.325 --> 00:10:23.261
Foolish girl. You
aren't going anywhere.

00:10:23.261 --> 00:10:25.197
You're incredibly naive.

00:10:25.197 --> 00:10:28.100
Don't you realize
you've been tricked?

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.502
The only reason I brought you here

00:10:30.502 --> 00:10:32.471
was to make you my prisoner.

00:10:33.071 --> 00:10:34.406
Prisoner?

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.957
"Answers I have about
your clan that you seek.

00:10:42.957 --> 00:10:45.526
To my base you will
come in five minutes

00:10:45.526 --> 00:10:47.962
when I launch the
missiles at your ship."

00:10:47.962 --> 00:10:50.331
That message doesn't
make any sense.

00:10:50.331 --> 00:10:52.333
Are you sure the
translator is working?

00:10:52.333 --> 00:10:53.201
I think so.

00:10:53.201 --> 00:10:57.104
Cosmo is the only one who
understands the Metarex's writing.

00:10:57.104 --> 00:10:59.307
Has Sonic figured
out where she went?

00:10:59.307 --> 00:11:02.910
Not yet, but I'm sure he'll find her
soon and send her to the bridge.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.246
I wouldn't count on
that, if I were you.

00:11:05.246 --> 00:11:07.248
Amy's ship is missing.

00:11:07.248 --> 00:11:08.216
Huh?

00:11:08.216 --> 00:11:11.953
How could she leave the Blue Typhoon
without the sensors spotting her?

00:11:11.953 --> 00:11:14.689
She must have had
help from a hacker.

00:11:14.689 --> 00:11:18.426
But the only one who could hack into
the system, other than me, is Chris.

00:11:18.426 --> 00:11:19.460
He's gone, too.

00:11:22.864 --> 00:11:24.098
Listen to me.

00:11:24.098 --> 00:11:26.767
There must be a way to
work this out peacefully.

00:11:26.767 --> 00:11:27.602
Can't we just try?

00:11:27.602 --> 00:11:28.636
Silence!

00:11:28.636 --> 00:11:31.606
I have no intention of
negotiating with you.

00:11:31.606 --> 00:11:33.207
You were not invited here.

00:11:33.207 --> 00:11:37.111
Return to your ship at once,
or you will be destroyed.

00:11:37.111 --> 00:11:39.714
I'm sorry I got you involved
in this mess, Chris.

00:11:39.714 --> 00:11:41.315
Forget it, okay?

00:11:41.315 --> 00:11:43.351
It's not like you forced
me to come along.

00:11:43.351 --> 00:11:45.219
I wanted to help you.

00:11:45.219 --> 00:11:48.789
I still don't understand exactly
why you wanted to come here,

00:11:48.789 --> 00:11:50.591
but I'm sure you had a good reason.

00:11:50.591 --> 00:11:51.425
I did!

00:11:51.425 --> 00:11:53.327
Please understand, I had to come!

00:11:53.327 --> 00:11:54.729
I had to. Really!

00:11:54.729 --> 00:11:57.231
[Laughing] I'm sorry
to laugh, Cosmo.

00:11:58.199 --> 00:12:01.102
It's just, you remind me of
myself when I was younger.

00:12:01.102 --> 00:12:02.537
When you were younger?

00:12:02.537 --> 00:12:05.907
When we make it back to the Blue
Typhoon, I'll try to explain.

00:12:05.907 --> 00:12:07.608
Let's get going.

00:12:08.075 --> 00:12:09.043
Hold it.

00:12:09.043 --> 00:12:11.712
Your friend Cosmo stays here.

00:12:11.712 --> 00:12:15.116
Sorry, but I don't
think so! [Explosion]

00:12:15.116 --> 00:12:16.083
[Gasp]

00:12:16.083 --> 00:12:17.652
Come on, Cosmo!

00:12:18.619 --> 00:12:21.923
This is the most dismal escape
attempt I've ever seen.

00:12:21.923 --> 00:12:25.092
I'll give them a head start to
try and add some excitement.

00:12:25.092 --> 00:12:29.597
[Panting]

00:12:29.597 --> 00:12:30.631
Oh!

00:12:30.631 --> 00:12:33.367
Don't worry, I've got
everything under control.

00:12:33.367 --> 00:12:34.101
Ah!

00:12:38.806 --> 00:12:39.774
Ah!

00:12:42.743 --> 00:12:44.445
Now let's go.

00:12:45.413 --> 00:12:47.348
[Both gasp]

00:12:48.449 --> 00:12:49.417
Ah!

00:12:50.117 --> 00:12:51.819
Chris, are you all right?

00:12:51.819 --> 00:12:55.389
Your friend is not hurt... for now.

00:12:55.389 --> 00:12:58.025
I must say I'm rather
pleased he tried to flee.

00:12:58.025 --> 00:13:00.294
It's been too long since
I've felt the thrill

00:13:00.294 --> 00:13:02.463
of taking down a foe
with my own hands.

00:13:02.463 --> 00:13:04.398
I must try it more often.

00:13:11.872 --> 00:13:13.274
TAILS: Okay, this is it.

00:13:13.274 --> 00:13:15.409
Target coordinates
for base are set.

00:13:15.409 --> 00:13:17.878
Prepare to load the
Sonic Power Cannon.

00:13:17.878 --> 00:13:21.549
AMY: I hope Sonic brings Chris
and Cosmo back here safely,

00:13:21.549 --> 00:13:23.484
so I can pound some
sense into them!

00:13:23.484 --> 00:13:25.386
CREAM: I can't believe
Chris was so reckless.

00:13:25.386 --> 00:13:27.822
Who does he think he is, Knuckles?

00:13:27.822 --> 00:13:30.224
Cut the chatter, and let's
get on with the attack.

00:13:30.224 --> 00:13:32.126
AMY: Take it easy. We're ready.

00:13:32.126 --> 00:13:33.160
Then let's go.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.596
Tails, let's fire up the
cannon to full power.

00:13:35.596 --> 00:13:37.832
Yeah. If we can get
Sonic in there fast,

00:13:37.832 --> 00:13:40.334
we may catch Black
Narcissus by surprise.

00:13:41.569 --> 00:13:43.104
All set, Sonic?

00:13:43.104 --> 00:13:44.605
Sure am!

00:13:44.605 --> 00:13:46.841
That Metarex won't
know what hit him.

00:13:46.841 --> 00:13:50.044
Okay, then I'll get the
cannon ready to fire.

00:13:52.046 --> 00:13:55.716
Increase the power level
to maximum energy now.

00:13:58.285 --> 00:14:00.921
Sonic, prepare for launch!

00:14:02.757 --> 00:14:05.026
I'm locking on target.

00:14:06.761 --> 00:14:07.728
Get ready!

00:14:07.728 --> 00:14:09.997
We're blasting you at
that base, full speed!

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.902
Sonic Power Cannon, fire!

00:14:31.686 --> 00:14:33.521
The scanner was right.

00:14:33.521 --> 00:14:35.790
There are a lot of
fake Emeralds here.

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:37.291
[Shuddering]

00:14:37.291 --> 00:14:39.593
Suddenly, I don't feel so great.

00:14:39.593 --> 00:14:41.362
BLACK NARCISSUS:
Sonic the Hedgehog.

00:14:41.362 --> 00:14:43.664
How kind of you to drop in.

00:14:43.664 --> 00:14:46.200
I've been looking
forward to meeting you.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.170
Won't you join me in
my command center?

00:14:52.173 --> 00:14:55.076
[Chuckling] You're not
at all what I expected.

00:14:55.076 --> 00:14:57.178
I didn't think you'd
be so... scrawny.

00:14:57.178 --> 00:14:59.480
It's hard to believe
you're a great fighter.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.384
Well, maybe later I can
prove to you how tough I am.

00:15:03.384 --> 00:15:05.453
But right now, I want
to see my friends.

00:15:05.453 --> 00:15:08.456
Now, are you gonna show
me where they are?

00:15:08.456 --> 00:15:10.157
Of course I will.

00:15:10.157 --> 00:15:12.093
Your friends have not been harmed.

00:15:12.093 --> 00:15:15.963
In fact, the only reason I took
them prisoner was to lure you here.

00:15:15.963 --> 00:15:19.600
You see, I've heard so many
stories about your powers

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.503
that I decided to bring you
here for an experiment.

00:15:22.503 --> 00:15:24.605
Sorry, pal, but I'm a hedgehog,

00:15:24.605 --> 00:15:26.107
not a guinea pig.

00:15:26.107 --> 00:15:28.242
Now, where are my friends?

00:15:28.242 --> 00:15:31.378
You will cooperate
with my experiment.

00:15:31.378 --> 00:15:34.882
We will start by collecting data
on your strength and speed.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:37.418
I already told you...

00:15:37.418 --> 00:15:38.953
There's no way I'm gonna help you.

00:15:38.953 --> 00:15:41.188
Now show me where my friends are!

00:15:41.188 --> 00:15:44.825
Since you refuse, then I will have
to experiment on your friends.

00:15:44.825 --> 00:15:46.727
This is a trap, Sonic!

00:15:46.727 --> 00:15:47.595
Huh!

00:15:52.903 --> 00:15:54.838
COSMO: Sonic! Get out!

00:15:54.838 --> 00:15:57.341
BLACK NARCISSUS: Your friends
certainly make a pathetic pair.

00:15:57.908 --> 00:15:59.876
Chris! Cosmo!

00:16:03.347 --> 00:16:06.750
The fate of your friends
rests entirely in your hands.

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:09.019
If you choose to oppose me,

00:16:09.019 --> 00:16:11.888
then I assure you, they
will pay a painful price.

00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:13.790
It should be quite entertaining.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:15.926
[Evil laughter]
[Sonic grimaces angrily]

00:16:15.926 --> 00:16:18.829
Well, Sonic, what is your decision?

00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:21.431
Are you ready to proceed
with the experiment?

00:16:21.431 --> 00:16:22.733
[Teeth gritting]

00:16:22.733 --> 00:16:25.669
I've never seen Cosmo
look so scared.

00:16:25.669 --> 00:16:26.870
Grr!

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:28.672
She should be.

00:16:28.672 --> 00:16:30.474
Grr!

00:16:30.474 --> 00:16:33.143
And Chris was passed out.

00:16:33.143 --> 00:16:34.678
What did you do to him?

00:16:34.678 --> 00:16:38.548
He attempted to escape. and
was taught a painful lesson.

00:16:40.217 --> 00:16:42.519
It is time for the experiment.

00:16:42.519 --> 00:16:46.590
These two Metarex were designed by
me, especially for this occasion.

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:50.193
Gold will test your strength,
and Silver, your speed.

00:16:50.193 --> 00:16:52.696
I based my Metarex designs on data

00:16:52.696 --> 00:16:55.866
that was collected during
previous battles against you.

00:16:55.866 --> 00:16:58.769
I'm eager to see if they're
powerful enough to defeat you.

00:16:58.769 --> 00:17:00.404
[Angry chuckling]

00:17:00.404 --> 00:17:01.671
All right, then.

00:17:01.671 --> 00:17:03.306
Let's test 'em out!

00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:05.776
[Grunting]

00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:10.914
[Robots groan]

00:17:14.785 --> 00:17:17.487
Looks like you'll have to go
back to the drawing board.

00:17:17.487 --> 00:17:19.890
DR. EGGMAN: Settle down, Sonic.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:23.326
I don't think I've ever seen
you this worked up before.

00:17:23.326 --> 00:17:25.962
You are not the only one
having a bad day, you know.

00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:28.198
Our trip was a real space odyssey.

00:17:28.198 --> 00:17:30.734
We had some mechanical
difficulties.

00:17:30.734 --> 00:17:33.336
For some reason, the Egg
Drive got scrambled up.

00:17:33.336 --> 00:17:35.138
Space travel is tricky.

00:17:35.138 --> 00:17:39.242
I've warped past so many planets,
I'm starting to see stars.

00:17:39.242 --> 00:17:40.710
Listen, Sonic.

00:17:41.344 --> 00:17:43.880
I'm really disappointed in you.

00:17:44.448 --> 00:17:48.251
From now on, be careful not to let
your temper get out of control,

00:17:48.251 --> 00:17:51.087
or one of these days, you may
find you're always angry,

00:17:51.087 --> 00:17:53.490
just like another hedgehog we know.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.025
You should get out of here.

00:17:55.025 --> 00:17:57.027
And don't worry about
your crew mates.

00:17:57.027 --> 00:17:59.162
Shadow already rescued them.

00:17:59.863 --> 00:18:03.099
SHADOW: Hmm. The kid
will be all right.

00:18:03.099 --> 00:18:05.035
I hope you learned your lesson.

00:18:05.035 --> 00:18:07.604
Next time, I may not
be around to save you.

00:18:07.604 --> 00:18:10.674
[Yelling]

00:18:13.043 --> 00:18:15.946
Rouge wrecked the machine that
makes the fake Chaos Emeralds.

00:18:15.946 --> 00:18:18.348
She seemed to get a
real kick out of it.

00:18:18.348 --> 00:18:19.816
Oof! Ack!

00:18:19.816 --> 00:18:20.984
That felt great.

00:18:20.984 --> 00:18:23.286
If there's one thing I hate,
it's imitation jewelry.

00:18:23.286 --> 00:18:25.121
You Metarex have bad taste.

00:18:25.121 --> 00:18:27.390
From now on, stick to genuine gems.

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:29.459
You did a great job, Rouge.

00:18:29.459 --> 00:18:30.594
That was awesome!

00:18:30.594 --> 00:18:34.097
Yes, I know. They don't call
me a knockout for nothin'.

00:18:35.265 --> 00:18:38.668
I don't like the way you
attacked Chris and Cosmo.

00:18:38.668 --> 00:18:41.004
It's one thing to take them
prisoner and threaten them,

00:18:41.004 --> 00:18:42.672
but when you actually
hurt somebody,

00:18:42.672 --> 00:18:44.174
that's going too far.

00:18:44.174 --> 00:18:45.575
DECOE: You said it, Doctor!

00:18:45.575 --> 00:18:47.544
BOCOE: Even we have
some principles.

00:18:47.544 --> 00:18:51.014
And I also don't like you making
counterfeit Chaos Emeralds.

00:18:51.014 --> 00:18:52.616
Yeah, that's phony-baloney!

00:18:52.616 --> 00:18:54.050
And another thing-

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.352
Silence!

00:18:55.352 --> 00:18:57.320
Back off, buster!

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.588
What the-

00:18:59.089 --> 00:19:01.625
[Yelling]

00:19:01.625 --> 00:19:03.126
[Grunt]

00:19:04.728 --> 00:19:06.897
Are you ready for round two?

00:19:06.897 --> 00:19:09.032
[Laughing]

00:19:09.032 --> 00:19:11.067
My robots are tougher
than they look.

00:19:11.067 --> 00:19:14.037
They could beat a whole army of
Metarex with their bare hands.

00:19:14.037 --> 00:19:16.406
Why did you interfere, Eggman?

00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:19.876
Because I want to send you
and your Meta-pals a warning.

00:19:19.876 --> 00:19:20.844
What warning?

00:19:20.844 --> 00:19:23.413
Are you teaming up with Sonic
and his friends against us?

00:19:23.413 --> 00:19:26.650
[Laughing] Well, now.
That all depends...

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:29.352
on whether you want me to
be your most dangerous foe,

00:19:29.352 --> 00:19:31.154
or most valuable friend.

00:19:31.154 --> 00:19:34.090
Black Narcissus, you'd better
tell your fellow commanders

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:36.359
not to underestimate me again.

00:19:36.359 --> 00:19:40.830
It's clear that your battle against
Sonic and his friends has just begun.

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:43.366
Today, I came to that
hedgehog's defense,

00:19:43.366 --> 00:19:45.869
but that doesn't mean
we're on the same side.

00:19:45.869 --> 00:19:50.273
I could still be persuaded to join
your team for the right price.

00:19:50.273 --> 00:19:52.842
[Evil laughter]

00:19:52.842 --> 00:19:56.342
