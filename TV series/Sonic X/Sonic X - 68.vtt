WEBVTT

00:00:02.267 --> 00:00:03.835
ROUGE: What's going on?

00:00:03.835 --> 00:00:06.237
Looks like a full-blown
space skirmish,

00:00:06.237 --> 00:00:07.705
and we're right in the middle!

00:00:07.705 --> 00:00:10.008
I cannot tell what who
they are, Doctor, but I

00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:12.377
have a feeling they are
not exactly friendly.

00:00:12.377 --> 00:00:14.546
Now let's not get hysterical.

00:00:14.546 --> 00:00:17.515
It's only Sonic and
his pea-brained posse.

00:00:19.784 --> 00:00:20.718
Huh?

00:00:32.764 --> 00:00:35.199
The warships are coming
at us from everywhere!

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:36.601
FIGHTER 1: We're way outnumbered!

00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:39.237
FIGHTER 2: We can't turn
back. It's too late!

00:00:42.373 --> 00:00:44.175
I'll distract the satellite ships!

00:00:44.175 --> 00:00:47.178
You aim for the fortress and
give it everything you've got!

00:00:48.413 --> 00:00:49.447
ALL: Roger!

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.485
They're aimed at the
mothership, sir.

00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:56.988
Then we must teach them a lesson.

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:02.894
Something tells me it's not Sonic.

00:01:02.894 --> 00:01:05.196
This is someone a
whole lot crankier!

00:01:05.196 --> 00:01:06.998
Quit quivering, you clanking clods!

00:01:06.998 --> 00:01:09.400
We'll call on our secret weapon!

00:01:11.235 --> 00:01:12.236
Oh, Shadow!

00:01:12.236 --> 00:01:14.038
It seems we're in
a bit of a pickle.

00:01:14.038 --> 00:01:15.406
See what you can do.

00:01:20.244 --> 00:01:21.079
[Grunt]

00:01:23.314 --> 00:01:24.282
Ah!

00:01:27.018 --> 00:01:27.585
[Gasp]

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.790
Ah!

00:01:37.295 --> 00:01:39.230
Could that be Black Wind?

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.798
Molly! You okay?

00:01:40.798 --> 00:01:42.934
Who was that guy? He
came out of nowhere!

00:01:42.934 --> 00:01:43.635
What next?

00:01:43.635 --> 00:01:44.602
Let's follow him!

00:01:44.602 --> 00:01:46.804
We may not be the only
resistance out here.

00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:48.106
Come on!

00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:53.411
It appears our enemies are more
resourceful than we thought.

00:01:53.411 --> 00:01:54.712
That's enough for now.

00:01:54.712 --> 00:01:55.613
Yes, sir.

00:01:55.613 --> 00:01:56.814
Retreat immediately.

00:01:56.814 --> 00:01:57.749
We'll be watching.

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:00.184
And when they least expect
it, we'll strike again.

00:02:00.184 --> 00:02:02.987
This time, we'll destroy them.

00:02:03.788 --> 00:02:05.390
Go, go, go, go, go

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.493
Gotta go fast

00:02:09.127 --> 00:02:11.429
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:02:13.731 --> 00:02:17.235
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:02:17.235 --> 00:02:19.303
Got ourselves a situation

00:02:19.303 --> 00:02:21.339
Stuck in a new location

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:24.942
Without any explanation

00:02:24.942 --> 00:02:27.011
No talk of relaxation

00:02:27.011 --> 00:02:28.646
Don't, don't, don't

00:02:28.646 --> 00:02:30.448
Don't blink, don't think

00:02:30.448 --> 00:02:32.250
Just go, go, go, go

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.751
Go, go

00:02:37.422 --> 00:02:39.290
Sonic is on the run

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.192
Sonic, he's number one

00:02:41.192 --> 00:02:44.929
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:48.599
-<i>Gotta go fast</i>
-<i>Sonic</i>

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.002
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:02:51.002 --> 00:02:52.904
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:02:52.904 --> 00:02:55.406
Sonic X

00:02:55.406 --> 00:02:57.341
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:02:58.076 --> 00:03:00.144
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:03:00.144 --> 00:03:01.179
Sonic X

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.168
We're very grateful to you.

00:03:12.168 --> 00:03:13.603
Think nothing of it.

00:03:13.603 --> 00:03:17.240
Those Metarex can certainly be
a nuisance, with a capital N.

00:03:24.781 --> 00:03:26.950
This is Cascade, our home planet.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.385
My friends and I are the
only ones living here now.

00:03:29.385 --> 00:03:32.288
They've arranged a welcome
reception for you at the base.

00:03:32.288 --> 00:03:34.724
I'm sure they'd be greatly
honored if you'd come.

00:03:34.724 --> 00:03:35.925
We'll see you there.

00:03:35.925 --> 00:03:37.026
Heh.

00:03:37.026 --> 00:03:40.063
[Beeping]

00:03:40.063 --> 00:03:41.965
I'd be happy to come...

00:03:41.965 --> 00:03:44.167
now that I know there's
a Chaos Emerald

00:03:44.167 --> 00:03:46.836
lying among those wretched
ruins down there.

00:03:46.836 --> 00:03:49.072
See what you can find, Shadow.

00:03:49.772 --> 00:03:51.307
I'll take a look around.

00:03:51.307 --> 00:03:52.842
Be discreet.

00:03:52.842 --> 00:03:56.112
If Rouge and her sticky fingers
find out there are Chaos Emeralds

00:03:56.112 --> 00:03:57.780
floating about, why,
she's liable to-

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.782
I'm liable to what, Eggy-poo?

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.286
Uh-oh! Talk about busted!

00:04:03.286 --> 00:04:06.189
You're afraid I might just
snatch them up for myself.

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:08.791
How can I ever convince
you I'm on the level?

00:04:09.225 --> 00:04:11.227
Grr! Yeah, right!

00:04:11.227 --> 00:04:12.161
Take Rouge with you,

00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:13.796
but you'd better
keep an eye on her!

00:04:14.197 --> 00:04:15.265
Hmm.

00:04:21.771 --> 00:04:23.540
Eggman doesn't care about you.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.642
He only wants to use you
to get what he wants.

00:04:25.642 --> 00:04:27.076
Don't you see that?

00:04:27.076 --> 00:04:28.478
Of course I do.

00:04:28.478 --> 00:04:31.514
Shadow transported us
to Space Colony ARK.

00:04:31.514 --> 00:04:32.715
That's right.

00:04:32.715 --> 00:04:35.685
Shadow, wasn't that the
home of your friend Maria?

00:04:35.685 --> 00:04:38.988
We all know you're just
collecting 'em for Dr. Eggman.

00:04:38.988 --> 00:04:41.491
He's really got you
fooled, doesn't he, pal?

00:04:41.491 --> 00:04:42.458
Shadow!

00:04:42.458 --> 00:04:43.526
Hm?

00:04:46.462 --> 00:04:48.932
Sorry. I just wanted to thank you.

00:04:48.932 --> 00:04:50.099
What you did...

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:52.201
I mean, it was really incredible.

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:54.137
Yeah.

00:04:54.137 --> 00:04:55.672
No, I mean it, Shadow.

00:04:55.672 --> 00:04:57.040
How did you do it?

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.642
You destroyed those
ships in seconds flat.

00:04:59.642 --> 00:05:02.812
My comrades and I were really
impressed, and I just-

00:05:02.812 --> 00:05:03.680
Huh?

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.082
I just want to know more about you,

00:05:06.082 --> 00:05:08.117
like where you learned
to battle like that.

00:05:08.117 --> 00:05:09.619
You were amazing!

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.155
Drop it, okay?

00:05:12.855 --> 00:05:14.090
Oh, no.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.125
I didn't mean to make him angry.

00:05:16.125 --> 00:05:17.360
Don't worry, hon.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.395
He's always grumpy.

00:05:19.395 --> 00:05:20.763
Why is that?

00:05:20.763 --> 00:05:22.231
Ya got me.

00:05:22.231 --> 00:05:25.568
But just 'cause he's a hero,
doesn't mean he's Prince Charming.

00:05:25.568 --> 00:05:27.971
That strong, silent
jazz drives me batty.

00:05:29.973 --> 00:05:30.673
Wait!

00:05:30.673 --> 00:05:34.077
You attacked four Metarex ships
like it was nothing at all!

00:05:34.077 --> 00:05:36.579
I've never seen bravery
like that before.

00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:39.882
It was like the legend
of Black Wind.

00:05:39.882 --> 00:05:40.917
Never heard of him.

00:05:41.751 --> 00:05:42.952
Hm.

00:05:43.686 --> 00:05:46.990
Long ago, there was a great
hero named Black Wind.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.325
We called him that, because
he came out of the night to

00:05:49.325 --> 00:05:52.195
fight for our people, and
was never seen again.

00:05:52.195 --> 00:05:54.330
For a moment, when I
first saw you outside my

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.599
ship, I thought maybe you were him.

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:58.034
You're a hero!

00:05:58.034 --> 00:05:58.968
Shadow!

00:05:58.968 --> 00:06:01.437
You're wrong. I'm no hero.

00:06:01.437 --> 00:06:03.973
That's right. He's
just out for himself.

00:06:03.973 --> 00:06:05.375
Aren't you, Shadow?

00:06:05.375 --> 00:06:06.609
Well, you should talk.

00:06:06.609 --> 00:06:08.911
You'd do just about anything
to get what you want.

00:06:08.911 --> 00:06:09.879
[Gasp]

00:06:15.852 --> 00:06:17.320
That's right, doctor.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.656
If you hadn't come along, who
knows what would've happened.

00:06:19.656 --> 00:06:21.724
Thanks to you, the
resistance lives on.

00:06:21.724 --> 00:06:23.126
You're too kind.

00:06:23.126 --> 00:06:26.696
It was the least I could do
for my fellow revolutionaries.

00:06:26.696 --> 00:06:29.332
You are a truly noble and
honorable warrior, sir.

00:06:29.332 --> 00:06:30.266
Mm-hmm.

00:06:30.266 --> 00:06:31.334
FIGHTERS: Here, here!

00:06:31.334 --> 00:06:34.170
Maybe now would be a good time
to ask about that Chaos Emerald-

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:35.338
ALL: Oops!

00:06:35.338 --> 00:06:36.305
Ahem!

00:06:36.305 --> 00:06:38.374
Perhaps you're right, Decoe.

00:06:38.374 --> 00:06:41.577
I would be tickled to continue
assisting your mission.

00:06:41.577 --> 00:06:45.648
Provided we find a way to,
shall we say, sweeten the deal.

00:06:45.648 --> 00:06:48.184
You got it. After
all, it's only fair.

00:06:48.184 --> 00:06:50.787
You've proven yourself
to be a great ally, sir.

00:06:50.787 --> 00:06:52.355
That's right. You deserve it.

00:06:52.355 --> 00:06:54.090
We don't often find like-minded

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.658
freedom fighters such as yourself.

00:06:55.658 --> 00:06:57.193
What's ours is yours, sir.

00:06:57.193 --> 00:06:59.128
Ever since our planet
was destroyed,

00:06:59.128 --> 00:07:01.564
we have no need for
a Chaos Emerald.

00:07:01.564 --> 00:07:05.234
Passing it on to such a worthy and
brilliant man would indeed be an honor.

00:07:05.234 --> 00:07:07.570
Comrade Leon speaks
for all of us, sir.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.274
A Chaos Emerald is the least we can
give for your invaluable friendship.

00:07:11.274 --> 00:07:12.909
We humbly thank you.

00:07:14.077 --> 00:07:15.378
What's going on?

00:07:15.378 --> 00:07:16.279
Hm?

00:07:19.615 --> 00:07:21.551
We're giving him the Emerald.

00:07:21.551 --> 00:07:23.119
I need you to get it.

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:25.588
If you think it's best,
then I suppose we should.

00:07:25.588 --> 00:07:28.291
But we hid it so long ago,
I can't remember where.

00:07:28.291 --> 00:07:29.892
Let me think...

00:07:29.892 --> 00:07:30.660
Okay.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.763
You'll need to fly to Cascade to
Satellite City where the industrial

00:07:33.763 --> 00:07:34.997
district once was.

00:07:34.997 --> 00:07:37.667
There's a factory there with
three windows at the top.

00:07:37.667 --> 00:07:38.968
Then what?

00:07:38.968 --> 00:07:42.371
It's in a safe deposit box
right there on the main level.

00:07:42.371 --> 00:07:44.407
Okay, we'll fly there right now.

00:07:45.675 --> 00:07:47.376
Huh? What?

00:07:48.344 --> 00:07:50.747
Molly, I need you to
do something else.

00:07:50.747 --> 00:07:52.348
Something really important.

00:07:52.348 --> 00:07:56.452
You'll see a small locked cabinet
directly above the safe deposit box.

00:07:56.452 --> 00:07:58.755
Bring me whatever
files are in there.

00:07:58.755 --> 00:07:59.889
I don't get it.

00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:02.225
Why would you need a
bunch of dusty old files?

00:08:02.225 --> 00:08:05.962
Simple. They're historical records
on the Metarex invasion that

00:08:05.962 --> 00:08:07.597
just might prove useful to us.

00:08:07.597 --> 00:08:09.365
Sure. I'm on it!

00:08:20.576 --> 00:08:21.377
Hm...

00:08:21.377 --> 00:08:24.247
[All laughing]

00:08:30.987 --> 00:08:34.290
You wouldn't know it, but this
was once a beautiful place.

00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:36.125
You're right, honey.
I wouldn't know.

00:08:36.125 --> 00:08:39.162
I guess I'll have to
take your word for it.

00:08:39.162 --> 00:08:43.065
There was a time when Cascade
was a proud and glorious planet.

00:08:43.933 --> 00:08:46.636
But that time was so long ago...

00:08:46.636 --> 00:08:49.038
Way before the Metarex came.

00:08:49.038 --> 00:08:52.241
The galaxy had never
seen a greater planet.

00:08:52.241 --> 00:08:54.377
We were the mightiest
of all peoples,

00:08:54.377 --> 00:08:57.947
and with our superior intelligence,
and advanced technology,

00:08:57.947 --> 00:09:01.117
there was no telling how far
our dominion could extend.

00:09:01.117 --> 00:09:02.251
And in the blink of an eye,

00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:04.020
all our hopes were destroyed.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.456
Ever since that first attack, we
have had to fight to stay alive.

00:09:07.456 --> 00:09:10.726
So they've been socking it
to you all this time, huh?

00:09:10.726 --> 00:09:13.262
What is it those Metarex
want from you anyway?

00:09:14.597 --> 00:09:17.166
I guess all they want is to defeat.

00:09:17.166 --> 00:09:20.670
Whatever else they've wanted,
they've already taken.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.005
There's nothing left anymore.

00:09:23.873 --> 00:09:27.844
Well, why don't you guys
just go somewhere else?

00:09:27.844 --> 00:09:29.979
Don't you ever get
tired of fighting?

00:09:29.979 --> 00:09:31.447
Sure we do.

00:09:31.447 --> 00:09:33.850
But they still haven't
taken our hope away.

00:09:34.317 --> 00:09:37.987
The hope that soon, Cascade will
be beautiful and alive again,

00:09:37.987 --> 00:09:39.422
like it once was.

00:09:39.422 --> 00:09:41.490
And it will be! I'm sure it will!

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.727
And with Shadow's help, I
just know we'll beat them.

00:09:44.727 --> 00:09:45.695
Uh-huh.

00:10:06.156 --> 00:10:07.924
[Growling]

00:10:08.391 --> 00:10:09.559
I got him!

00:10:11.061 --> 00:10:12.162
[Monster groans]

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:14.664
[Gasp]

00:10:14.664 --> 00:10:16.233
[Monsters growling]

00:10:16.233 --> 00:10:17.267
Ah!

00:10:17.267 --> 00:10:20.136
[Monsters scream]

00:10:20.136 --> 00:10:21.638
Come on!

00:10:24.007 --> 00:10:26.876
You might wanna think about letting
one of us walk ahead for a bit.

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:28.812
You know, just for safety's sake.

00:10:28.812 --> 00:10:31.414
Plus, you're the only one who
knows where this place is.

00:10:31.414 --> 00:10:34.384
It'd be silly to put you in danger.

00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:35.352
It's all right.

00:10:35.352 --> 00:10:37.654
The spirit of Black
Wind is with me.

00:10:39.623 --> 00:10:41.524
Come on, you two. Follow me.

00:10:41.524 --> 00:10:43.326
The factory's over here.

00:10:43.326 --> 00:10:44.594
I don't like it.

00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:49.599
My radar's telling me there was something
extra fishy about those piranhas.

00:10:49.599 --> 00:10:52.435
I never thought I'd say this,
but I think you're right.

00:10:52.435 --> 00:10:55.105
That attack was an ambush,
if I ever saw one.

00:10:55.105 --> 00:10:59.009
So you're saying some boob
set up a booby trap, huh?

00:10:59.009 --> 00:11:00.377
Any suspects?

00:11:02.345 --> 00:11:04.180
I have my suspicions.

00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:06.850
Ya feel like sharing?

00:11:07.617 --> 00:11:09.252
Come on! Molly's waiting for us.

00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:11.021
I don't want her alone in there.

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:15.292
Uh!

00:11:29.706 --> 00:11:31.708
Hello! Come to mama.

00:11:33.243 --> 00:11:35.312
Don't forget I got my eye on you.

00:11:35.312 --> 00:11:36.579
Oh, come on.

00:11:36.579 --> 00:11:39.115
We're on the same team,
aren't we, Shadow?

00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:40.684
Sure we are.

00:11:40.684 --> 00:11:42.152
How insulting.

00:11:42.152 --> 00:11:44.187
Let's see... Here it is!

00:11:46.856 --> 00:11:47.991
[Gasp]

00:11:47.991 --> 00:11:50.894
[Beeping]

00:11:50.894 --> 00:11:51.895
[Gasp]

00:11:51.895 --> 00:11:52.929
Ah!

00:11:59.369 --> 00:12:00.904
[Groan] What happened?

00:12:00.904 --> 00:12:04.074
Someone deliberately put
that bomb in the cabinet.

00:12:04.074 --> 00:12:06.076
Who gave you the key, Molly?

00:12:06.076 --> 00:12:07.911
[Gasp] It was Leon!

00:12:12.215 --> 00:12:13.917
It can't be true.

00:12:13.917 --> 00:12:15.652
He would never!

00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:16.886
It can't be!

00:12:20.857 --> 00:12:22.859
Well, looky here.

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:31.368
Doctor, do you read me?

00:12:31.368 --> 00:12:32.402
Doctor!

00:12:34.204 --> 00:12:36.106
That double-crossing Leon.

00:12:36.106 --> 00:12:39.342
He and his comrades have been
cooking up some nasty little deal,

00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:41.211
but they had to get
Molly out of the way.

00:12:41.211 --> 00:12:42.779
You're wrong!

00:12:42.779 --> 00:12:44.280
He'd never hurt me!

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.982
Not ever!

00:12:45.982 --> 00:12:47.417
We're all a team!

00:12:47.417 --> 00:12:48.885
They'd never betray me!

00:12:50.286 --> 00:12:51.788
I must admit,

00:12:51.788 --> 00:12:53.723
when you first approached
me with your request,

00:12:53.723 --> 00:12:55.291
I was quite taken aback.

00:12:55.291 --> 00:12:58.194
You and your feisty friends have
been battling us for so long,

00:12:58.194 --> 00:12:59.696
I thought you would never give up.

00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:01.331
But I understand, of course.

00:13:01.331 --> 00:13:04.000
Fighting such as this can
become quite exhausting,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.302
especially when one
is on the losing team.

00:13:06.302 --> 00:13:07.637
That's right.

00:13:07.637 --> 00:13:11.007
Which is why we have all decided
to join forces with you.

00:13:11.007 --> 00:13:11.975
And the girl?

00:13:11.975 --> 00:13:14.978
I would be quite surprised if she
agrees to such an arrangement.

00:13:14.978 --> 00:13:16.279
She won't.

00:13:16.279 --> 00:13:17.313
But don't worry.

00:13:17.313 --> 00:13:19.816
I've sent her someplace
where she won't interfere.

00:13:19.816 --> 00:13:22.719
We'll hand over Eggman as promised.

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:25.221
Now let's get this
over with already.

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:26.556
[Evil chuckle]

00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:29.926
I should think I'd have a
say in this diabolical deal.

00:13:29.926 --> 00:13:32.796
You thought you were pretty
clever, didn't you, my friend?

00:13:32.796 --> 00:13:35.999
But unfortunately, you're
not clever enough.

00:13:35.999 --> 00:13:37.267
Don't move!

00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:40.937
And you, there.

00:13:40.937 --> 00:13:43.039
You work for Dark Oak, I presume?

00:13:43.039 --> 00:13:44.607
You presume correctly.

00:13:44.607 --> 00:13:48.178
However, I am but one emissary
of the great master.

00:13:48.178 --> 00:13:49.212
We are many.

00:13:49.212 --> 00:13:50.280
Heh.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.184
Well you and your Meta-pals may have
fooled our crafty comrade here,

00:13:54.184 --> 00:13:57.220
but fooling the great
Eggman won't be so easy.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.889
Hey! That's enough outta you!

00:13:59.889 --> 00:14:01.357
[Chuckling]

00:14:04.561 --> 00:14:05.929
[Groaning]

00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:06.896
Ah!

00:14:08.231 --> 00:14:09.799
Dr. Eggman!

00:14:09.799 --> 00:14:11.734
Our timing is impeccable!

00:14:16.105 --> 00:14:17.674
Please, wait!

00:14:18.408 --> 00:14:21.144
Don't go. You'll only get hurt.

00:14:21.678 --> 00:14:23.213
Don't be foolish, Molly.

00:14:23.213 --> 00:14:26.583
Now isn't the time to go and
get revenge on that Leon guy.

00:14:26.583 --> 00:14:29.152
It's way too dangerous.

00:14:29.152 --> 00:14:30.920
I have to find out why.

00:14:33.356 --> 00:14:35.358
[Grimacing]

00:14:35.358 --> 00:14:36.326
[Gasp]

00:14:41.097 --> 00:14:43.466
I don't know what
those guys are up to,

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:45.602
but they want Molly out of the way.

00:14:45.602 --> 00:14:48.204
And I'm going to
stop them, somehow.

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:50.807
Shadow?

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:51.808
I'm going.

00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:55.044
I don't know why, but I feel
like I have to protect her,

00:14:55.044 --> 00:14:57.614
or something terrible will happen.

00:15:09.777 --> 00:15:10.812
Hurry up!

00:15:10.812 --> 00:15:12.280
If we let Eggman get away,

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.049
the Metarex will destroy
every one of us!

00:15:16.818 --> 00:15:19.020
I've had enough of
this foolishness.

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.923
E-3000, have a little
fun, why don't you?

00:15:25.593 --> 00:15:27.428
Aaaah!

00:15:34.302 --> 00:15:36.304
Ha! Bull's-eye!

00:15:36.304 --> 00:15:37.572
A crushing defeat!

00:15:37.572 --> 00:15:39.107
You can say that again.

00:15:40.608 --> 00:15:41.542
Whoa!

00:15:41.542 --> 00:15:42.577
What's going on here?

00:15:42.577 --> 00:15:44.078
Grrr!

00:15:51.786 --> 00:15:54.889
It looks as if there has
been a change of plans.

00:15:54.889 --> 00:15:56.891
You've not kept your
word, my friend.

00:15:56.891 --> 00:15:58.393
So disappointing.

00:15:58.393 --> 00:16:00.228
Wait! I promised you Eggman,

00:16:00.228 --> 00:16:01.663
and you'll have him, I swear!

00:16:01.663 --> 00:16:02.964
I just need more time!

00:16:02.964 --> 00:16:05.767
Unfortunately, patience
is not my strong suit.

00:16:05.767 --> 00:16:07.902
You've dropped your
end of the bargain.

00:16:07.902 --> 00:16:09.103
You lose.

00:16:09.103 --> 00:16:11.339
No! Please!

00:16:11.339 --> 00:16:13.074
Leon! What did he say?

00:16:13.074 --> 00:16:14.442
Will they let us join them?

00:16:14.442 --> 00:16:15.310
Will they?

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:17.679
I... I don't know.

00:16:17.679 --> 00:16:19.314
How could you do it, Leon?

00:16:20.315 --> 00:16:21.316
[Gasp]

00:16:22.083 --> 00:16:22.917
Ah!

00:16:22.917 --> 00:16:24.152
You made a deal with them.

00:16:24.152 --> 00:16:27.588
You wanted to abandon everything
we've worked so hard for.

00:16:27.588 --> 00:16:28.990
What about our planet?

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.559
What about the promise
we made to our ancestors?

00:16:31.559 --> 00:16:32.794
We've had enough!

00:16:32.794 --> 00:16:33.761
[Gasp]

00:16:34.395 --> 00:16:35.630
We're too tired.

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.999
We can't go on fighting
like this forever.

00:16:37.999 --> 00:16:40.068
Every day is the same thing.

00:16:40.068 --> 00:16:42.370
If we surrender, the
fighting will be over,

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.372
and we'll live forever.

00:16:44.372 --> 00:16:45.473
Please understand.

00:16:45.473 --> 00:16:47.675
I can't go on like
this anymore, Molly.

00:16:47.675 --> 00:16:49.377
I'm tired.

00:16:49.377 --> 00:16:51.279
You wouldn't have
gone along with it!

00:16:51.279 --> 00:16:53.781
I'm sorry, but it was
either us, or you.

00:16:55.083 --> 00:17:02.290
[Crying]

00:17:02.857 --> 00:17:04.292
Don't cry, Molly!

00:17:04.292 --> 00:17:05.860
Shadow!

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:08.296
I'll be there anytime you need me.

00:17:08.296 --> 00:17:10.565
Just like in that story, remember?

00:17:13.501 --> 00:17:14.235
[Grunt]

00:17:17.472 --> 00:17:19.040
[Grunt]

00:17:27.482 --> 00:17:28.716
Hmm.

00:17:32.453 --> 00:17:33.921
I'll show them.

00:17:35.857 --> 00:17:37.792
I'll keep fighting.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.561
I'll be back one day.

00:17:40.561 --> 00:17:42.063
Huh.

00:17:42.797 --> 00:17:43.631
Ah!

00:17:44.966 --> 00:17:45.933
Hm.

00:17:46.901 --> 00:17:47.869
[Grunt]

00:17:51.372 --> 00:17:53.007
Aaaah!

00:17:54.342 --> 00:17:55.343
Huh!

00:17:56.944 --> 00:17:59.313
I'll keep fighting too, Molly.

00:17:59.313 --> 00:18:01.682
Maybe we'll meet again someday.

00:18:06.254 --> 00:18:07.488
Huh!

00:18:13.861 --> 00:18:15.430
[Grunt]

00:18:35.483 --> 00:18:36.884
I gotta admit,

00:18:36.884 --> 00:18:38.086
that Molly chick?

00:18:38.086 --> 00:18:40.021
She was tougher than I thought.

00:18:40.555 --> 00:18:42.924
Hey Shadow, you okay?

00:18:43.524 --> 00:18:45.493
Sure, I'm fine.

00:18:45.493 --> 00:18:48.563
It's just... you seem
to like her, and all.

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:52.033
Well, sure I liked her.
She was a good kid.

00:18:52.033 --> 00:18:54.469
I just hope she'll be okay.

00:18:54.469 --> 00:18:57.839
She's all alone out
there, that's all.

00:19:01.776 --> 00:19:02.944
Huh?

00:19:04.745 --> 00:19:06.047
[Gasp]

00:19:06.047 --> 00:19:07.081
What?

00:19:07.081 --> 00:19:09.050
Give that to Eggman, will ya?

00:19:11.786 --> 00:19:12.753
[Gasp]

00:19:23.798 --> 00:19:27.001
Doctor, we are getting
a message from someone.

00:19:27.001 --> 00:19:28.402
Should I connect them now?

00:19:28.402 --> 00:19:29.604
Quickly!

00:19:31.072 --> 00:19:32.573
Hmm?

00:19:38.546 --> 00:19:41.449
Your luck is running out, doctor.

00:19:41.449 --> 00:19:44.949
