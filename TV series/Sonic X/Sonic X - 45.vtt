reported that the notorious

00:03:13.944 --> 00:03:16.347
Dr. Eggman had escaped from jail

00:03:16.347 --> 00:03:19.116
along with his two
mechanical henchmen.

00:03:19.116 --> 00:03:22.887
Officials now believe that Eggman and
his robots are hiding underground,

00:03:22.887 --> 00:03:25.055
plotting their next assault.

00:03:25.055 --> 00:03:26.991
In an effort to undermine the plot,

00:03:26.991 --> 00:03:29.727
the president has formulated a
plan that will involve Sonic,

00:03:29.727 --> 00:03:31.462
Knuckles, and Rouge the Bat.

00:03:31.462 --> 00:03:32.997

this exciting development.

appear that Sonic,

one might expect them to be.

Oh, well. If he really doesn't
want to prove himself,

00:07:37.107 --> 00:07:39.543
[Everyone groans]

00:07:39.543 --> 00:07:41.478
Listen, maybe we-

00:07:41.478 --> 00:07:44.114
Uh, he hung up on me.

00:07:44.114 --> 00:07:45.482
Well, I guess it's settled.

00:07:45.482 --> 00:07:47.017
The martial arts
tournament planners

00:07:47.017 --> 00:07:49.720
have just released the
official event schedule.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.222
They've also begun announcing
who'll be competing.

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:55.025
Slots are filling up
fast, so call now.

00:07:55.025 --> 00:07:56.760
We'll be right back after this.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.796
And roll commercial.

00:07:58.796 --> 00:08:00.998
I'm doing an infomercial.

00:08:00.998 --> 00:08:03.634
This is gonna kill my credibility.

00:08:03.634 --> 00:08:07.805
[All talking at once]

00:08:07.805 --> 00:08:09.707
[Grunting]

00:08:10.007 --> 00:08:11.008
Aah!!

00:08:11.008 --> 00:08:14.778
[Blowing]

00:08:14.778 --> 00:08:15.746
Grr!

00:08:15.746 --> 00:08:17.681
Now, thanks to those
loitering layabouts,

00:08:17.681 --> 00:08:19.650
my thumb is as flat as a flapjack!

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.019
How dare those two slowpokes
keep me waiting?

00:08:22.019 --> 00:08:23.921
Bokkun, come here right away!

00:08:23.921 --> 00:08:26.957
Here I am! What is it, Dr. Eggman?

00:08:26.957 --> 00:08:29.793
Find those two tardy tin
cans and step on it!

00:08:29.793 --> 00:08:31.428
Yes, sir, Doctor!

00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:32.109
[Laughs]

00:08:36.102 --> 00:08:38.471
[Crowd cheering]

00:08:38.471 --> 00:08:40.407
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,

00:08:40.407 --> 00:08:43.610
to the first annual Chaos
Emerald Martial Arts Mash-up.

00:08:47.314 --> 00:08:54.020
Today's participants will be competing
for this authentic Chaos Emerald!

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.555
Woah! [Crowd cheers]

00:08:55.555 --> 00:08:57.557
Looks like a picture of my insides.

00:08:57.557 --> 00:08:59.459
[Giggling]

00:09:02.862 --> 00:09:05.932
The atmosphere here at the
stadium is absolutely electric,

00:09:05.932 --> 00:09:08.668
and rumor has it, a special
surprise participant

00:09:08.668 --> 00:09:11.371
is about to kick off this
martial arts challenge.

00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:13.373
[Grunting]

00:09:14.007 --> 00:09:15.408
This is a bad idea.

00:09:15.408 --> 00:09:18.311
I may have a paunch,
but I have a punch

00:09:19.746 --> 00:09:22.849
The crowd is cheering for
today's Master of Ceremonies,

00:09:22.849 --> 00:09:25.852
the owner of diamond
stadium, Elmer Johnson.

00:09:25.852 --> 00:09:28.888
Let's listen as he introduces
our first two competitors.

00:09:28.888 --> 00:09:32.625
In this corner, the president!

00:09:32.625 --> 00:09:34.527
[Cheering]

00:09:35.595 --> 00:09:40.300
And his opponent in black
armor, the black knight!

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:44.537
[Cheering and jeering]

00:09:44.537 --> 00:09:47.207
Are you sure you want to
do this, Mr. President?

00:09:47.207 --> 00:09:48.108
No.

00:09:48.108 --> 00:09:49.743
Let the Mash-up begin!

00:09:49.743 --> 00:09:50.710
[Bell rings]

00:09:53.813 --> 00:09:56.750
Grrrr!!!

00:09:57.317 --> 00:09:58.618
Ah!

00:09:59.319 --> 00:10:05.959
[Grunting]

00:10:08.795 --> 00:10:09.462
Ah!

00:10:09.462 --> 00:10:13.533
[Laughing]

00:10:13.533 --> 00:10:15.035
Oh, no!

00:10:15.035 --> 00:10:16.036
Woah!

00:10:18.038 --> 00:10:20.940
The black knight will
move to the second round.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.843
The president's aide
threw in the towel.

00:10:25.011 --> 00:10:26.646
Why'd you do that?

00:10:26.646 --> 00:10:29.582
I think you've had more power
lunches than power punches.

00:10:29.582 --> 00:10:33.586
[Crying]

00:10:33.586 --> 00:10:36.489
Now, let's move on to our
next exciting match-up.

00:10:36.489 --> 00:10:37.824
[Bell rings]

00:10:39.993 --> 00:10:41.161
Look out!

00:10:41.161 --> 00:10:44.664
It looks like one of these young
classmates is ready to rumble.

00:10:44.664 --> 00:10:45.665
Huh?

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.202
Chris, what's the matter?

00:10:49.202 --> 00:10:51.404
I'm sorry. I don't want to fight.

00:10:51.404 --> 00:10:55.141
Yeah, but, Chris, we could
win that Chaos Emerald!

00:10:56.109 --> 00:10:58.411
[Sobbing] I don't want to get hurt!

00:10:58.411 --> 00:10:59.379
[Crying]

00:10:59.379 --> 00:11:01.681
Look, take it easy.
We won't fight, okay?

00:11:01.681 --> 00:11:04.150
I won't touch you. See?
I'm not even near you.

00:11:05.118 --> 00:11:06.219
Perfect.

00:11:06.219 --> 00:11:07.754
I gotcha!

00:11:08.655 --> 00:11:10.457
[Shout]

00:11:10.457 --> 00:11:12.158
No fair! That's fighting dirty!

00:11:12.158 --> 00:11:14.394
Who cares? It worked,
didn't it? Ha!

00:11:14.394 --> 00:11:16.996
SCARLET: From tears to
cheers in seconds flat,

00:11:16.996 --> 00:11:19.599
young Christopher Thorndyke
wins the match!

00:11:19.599 --> 00:11:21.601
[Upset cries]

00:11:23.169 --> 00:11:24.571
Nice work, Chris.

00:11:24.571 --> 00:11:26.039
Hi, Grandpa!

00:11:26.039 --> 00:11:29.309
Hey, what's with
that weird bathrobe?

00:11:29.309 --> 00:11:30.410
Ha ha!

00:11:32.112 --> 00:11:35.381
Back in my day, I was known
as "Thorndyke the Throttler!"

00:11:35.381 --> 00:11:37.383
[Laughing] Oh!

00:11:37.383 --> 00:11:39.819
Grandpa, what's wrong?

00:11:39.819 --> 00:11:41.354
[Sirens]

00:11:41.354 --> 00:11:43.790
[Crying] Ow!

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:45.325
Ohh!

00:11:47.327 --> 00:11:50.497
Professor Thorndyke has been forced
to withdraw from competition

00:11:50.497 --> 00:11:52.165
due to a warm-up injury.

00:11:52.165 --> 00:11:55.535
Therefore, the winner
by forfeit is Lucky.

00:11:55.535 --> 00:11:59.072
[Beeping]

00:11:59.072 --> 00:12:00.306
He won.

00:12:00.306 --> 00:12:02.742
Lucky certainly is lucky, isn't he?

00:12:02.742 --> 00:12:04.377
His name says it all.

00:12:04.377 --> 00:12:06.546
Wish me luck, Decoe. I battle next.

00:12:06.546 --> 00:12:08.615
Hey, so do I.

00:12:09.149 --> 00:12:10.216
Oh!

00:12:11.117 --> 00:12:13.119
Yeah! Bring it!

00:12:13.119 --> 00:12:15.355
I will not hold back.

00:12:15.355 --> 00:12:16.856
Neither will I.

00:12:16.856 --> 00:12:18.424
Aah!

00:12:18.424 --> 00:12:21.961

00:12:21.961 --> 00:12:24.130
[Sirens]

00:12:25.098 --> 00:12:26.633
Freeze! You're under arrest.

00:12:26.633 --> 00:12:28.268
Surrender! You can't escape!

00:12:28.268 --> 00:12:29.636
We've got you surrounded.

00:12:29.636 --> 00:12:31.204
We're in trouble.

00:12:31.204 --> 00:12:33.139
Quick, run for it!

00:12:33.139 --> 00:12:34.107
Get 'em!

[Sirens]

00:12:37.944 --> 00:12:39.612
Our next match pits Hawk

00:12:39.612 --> 00:12:43.016
against everyone's favorite
high-flying fox, Tails.

00:12:43.016 --> 00:12:43.950
[Bell rings]

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:45.552
Yeah, let's go!

00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:48.054
Ready when you are.

00:12:48.721 --> 00:12:52.759
[Martial arts yelling]

00:12:52.759 --> 00:12:54.427
SCARLET: Hawk is on the offensive,

00:12:54.427 --> 00:12:58.231
showering his opponent with lightning-fast
moves and fists of fury.

00:12:58.231 --> 00:12:59.566
But Tails is keeping cool,

00:12:59.566 --> 00:13:02.268
and letting his twin tails
take the punishment.

00:13:02.268 --> 00:13:03.236
Aah!

00:13:03.236 --> 00:13:05.171
Here comes the kicker.

00:13:05.171 --> 00:13:06.439
[Gasp]

00:13:06.439 --> 00:13:08.741
Looks like the tails
are ready to attack.

00:13:10.243 --> 00:13:12.011
Those things don't scare me.

00:13:12.478 --> 00:13:13.413
Huh?

00:13:13.413 --> 00:13:14.514
I gotcha.

00:13:14.514 --> 00:13:16.182
Oh, yeah?

00:13:16.182 --> 00:13:17.750
Think again!

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:19.752
Woah!

00:13:19.752 --> 00:13:22.488
Hawk has suffered
a dizzying defeat.

00:13:22.488 --> 00:13:23.623
And I win!

00:13:23.623 --> 00:13:24.591
Aw...

00:13:24.991 --> 00:13:26.693
That was awesome!

00:13:26.693 --> 00:13:29.596
They like me! They really like me!

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:31.531
Hi, there!

00:13:31.531 --> 00:13:34.767
No way. They let you
enter this thing?

00:13:34.767 --> 00:13:37.203
[Crying] What's wrong with me?

00:13:37.203 --> 00:13:39.405
[Crying]

00:13:39.405 --> 00:13:43.076
[Crowd murmurs]

00:13:43.076 --> 00:13:44.611
There's nothing wrong with you.

00:13:44.611 --> 00:13:46.179
You're great! I was joking.

00:13:46.179 --> 00:13:48.314
Please don't cry, okay?

00:13:48.681 --> 00:13:50.250
Sorry about this, folks.

00:13:50.917 --> 00:13:53.152
He's just a little bit
nervous, that's all.

00:13:53.152 --> 00:13:54.554
Totally not my fault.

00:13:54.554 --> 00:13:55.622
Liar.

00:13:55.622 --> 00:13:56.456
Grr...!

00:13:56.456 --> 00:13:58.024
Oh!

00:13:58.491 --> 00:13:59.559
What did you say?

00:13:59.559 --> 00:14:00.426
Ah!

00:14:00.426 --> 00:14:02.262
Nothing, nothing. Honest!

00:14:02.262 --> 00:14:03.129
Ha!

00:14:03.129 --> 00:14:04.464
[Scream]

00:14:08.034 --> 00:14:10.937
SCARLET: And the winner
by a knockout is Amy!

00:14:10.937 --> 00:14:14.374
I couldn't have done it without
the support of all my fans.

00:14:14.374 --> 00:14:15.508
Hey, Amy!

00:14:15.508 --> 00:14:16.509
We love you!

00:14:16.509 --> 00:14:19.812
[Giggles] Thanks, everybody.
Right back at you!

00:14:19.812 --> 00:14:23.683
Well, folks, thus ends the first
half of this exciting tournament.

00:14:23.683 --> 00:14:26.219
We'll be taking a
short intermission.

00:14:26.219 --> 00:14:29.222
[Children laughing]

00:14:32.191 --> 00:14:34.193
Those loafing lunkheads!

00:14:34.193 --> 00:14:35.628
Where could they be?

00:14:35.628 --> 00:14:37.797
Just wait 'til I get
my hands on them!

00:14:41.034 --> 00:14:44.504
Boy, Chris. I couldn't believe
that was you out there.

00:14:44.504 --> 00:14:46.906
Why? Because I lied
and cheated a little?

00:14:46.906 --> 00:14:49.409
So what? Is that so wrong?

00:14:49.876 --> 00:14:50.743
Kinda.

00:14:50.743 --> 00:14:51.944
It's just...

00:14:51.944 --> 00:14:53.680
I'm always the good guy.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.582
I just wanted to see what
it felt like to be bad.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:58.918
It doesn't feel good.

00:14:59.519 --> 00:15:00.420
[Chuckle]

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:01.654
You know?

00:15:01.654 --> 00:15:04.390
Then don't do it again.

We're ready to begin
the second round of the

00:15:11.497 --> 00:15:14.434
first annual Chaos Emerald
Martial Arts Mash-up.

00:15:14.434 --> 00:15:17.837
First up, it's tough-guy Knuckles
versus the mysterious black knight.

00:15:17.837 --> 00:15:18.738
Grr.

00:15:18.738 --> 00:15:19.939
Let's go, metal man.

[Laughing]

00:15:21.641 --> 00:15:23.409
Oh, tough guy, eh?

00:15:23.943 --> 00:15:25.912
We'll just see about that.

00:15:25.912 --> 00:15:28.348
Aaaaah!

00:15:28.348 --> 00:15:30.683
Don't hurt me, Knuckles!
Just let me win!

00:15:30.683 --> 00:15:32.285
Please, I'm begging you!

00:15:32.285 --> 00:15:33.920
Who are you, anyway?

00:15:34.721 --> 00:15:36.756
It's me. [Grunt]

00:15:37.924 --> 00:15:39.459
You're the black knight?

00:15:39.459 --> 00:15:41.361
I need that Chaos Emerald.

00:15:41.361 --> 00:15:42.929
I don't have any money.

00:15:42.929 --> 00:15:43.896
Grr.

00:15:43.896 --> 00:15:45.832
There's one thing I cannot stand...

00:15:45.832 --> 00:15:47.166
a whiner!

00:15:47.166 --> 00:15:51.671
Ahhh!

00:15:51.671 --> 00:15:53.606
[Bell rings] The black
knight turned yellow,

00:15:53.606 --> 00:15:55.708
so Knuckles wins the match.

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:58.444
DANNY: Hey, Chris!

00:15:58.444 --> 00:15:59.245
Huh?

00:16:00.179 --> 00:16:01.180
Danny!

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:03.449
I just wanted to
wish you good luck.

00:16:03.449 --> 00:16:04.984
Thank you.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:08.688
Huh?

00:16:13.726 --> 00:16:17.663
Our next fighter is dropping in
just in time for the next match.

00:16:22.935 --> 00:16:23.903
Dad?

00:16:23.903 --> 00:16:24.937
Huh?

00:16:24.937 --> 00:16:25.938
[Bell rings]

00:16:31.078 --> 00:16:33.447
Well, son, if you want to
make it to the quarterfinals,

00:16:33.447 --> 00:16:35.449
you'll have to beat
your old man first!

00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:36.583
Let's go!

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:38.118
[Grimacing]

00:16:39.086 --> 00:16:41.021
He'll have a hard time with Nelson.

00:16:41.021 --> 00:16:43.357
I taught him everything he knows.

00:16:43.357 --> 00:16:45.292
Ow! Ow ow ow! I give up! Ow!

00:16:45.292 --> 00:16:46.860
Uncle! Uncle! Ow! Stop!

00:16:47.294 --> 00:16:49.730
I guess talent must
skip a generation...

00:16:51.932 --> 00:16:53.500
Let's see what ya got.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.468
Okay.

00:16:54.468 --> 00:16:57.271
[Sounds of fighting]

00:16:57.271 --> 00:16:59.306
Uncle Sam, don't!

00:16:59.306 --> 00:17:01.708
I can't go easy on him just
because he's your teacher!

00:17:02.042 --> 00:17:05.445
I know. But they didn't
ring the starting bell yet!

00:17:05.445 --> 00:17:06.280
Oh!

00:17:07.781 --> 00:17:09.149
Oh, well!

00:17:09.149 --> 00:17:10.717
I'm in a hurry anyway!

00:17:11.818 --> 00:17:13.353
Saved by the bell!

00:17:13.353 --> 00:17:15.055
Mr. Stewart is the winner!

00:17:15.055 --> 00:17:17.958
And since both of the
robots are on the run,

00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:19.526
Lucky wins again!

00:17:19.526 --> 00:17:20.861
Lucky guy!

00:17:20.861 --> 00:17:23.730
[Beeping]

00:17:26.233 --> 00:17:27.434
[Bell rings]

00:17:27.434 --> 00:17:28.535
Come on!

00:17:31.338 --> 00:17:32.339
Hm...

00:17:32.706 --> 00:17:33.707
[Gasp]

00:17:34.675 --> 00:17:35.709
[Gasp]

00:17:36.643 --> 00:17:38.545
Is this... for me?

00:17:38.979 --> 00:17:41.548
Yes. And so am I.

00:17:41.548 --> 00:17:43.550
I'm... so happy!

00:17:44.785 --> 00:17:46.954
Ella, what just happened?

00:17:46.954 --> 00:17:49.456
It's very simple. You can
catch more flies with honey,

00:17:49.456 --> 00:17:50.891
than you can with vinegar!

00:17:50.891 --> 00:17:52.125
What does that mean?

00:17:52.125 --> 00:17:55.028
You'll both understand when
you get a little older.

00:17:55.028 --> 00:17:56.997
Now it's time for my match!

00:17:59.299 --> 00:18:00.667
Emerl!

00:18:00.667 --> 00:18:02.236
I know you can win!

00:18:05.572 --> 00:18:08.742
But whatever happens, be
extra gentle with Ella, okay?

00:18:08.742 --> 00:18:12.212
[Beeping]

00:18:12.212 --> 00:18:13.680
Oh...

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.582
What's wrong with Emerl?

00:18:15.949 --> 00:18:18.752
He doesn't know how he
can win if he's gentle.

00:18:18.752 --> 00:18:20.687
Aw, that's terrible!

00:18:21.321 --> 00:18:22.923
What should we do, Cheese?

00:18:22.923 --> 00:18:24.258
Chao!

00:18:25.225 --> 00:18:28.161
Ah! I have an idea!
I'll forfeit the match!

00:18:28.161 --> 00:18:30.364
But... are you sure?

00:18:30.364 --> 00:18:31.865
Sure, I'm sure!

00:18:31.865 --> 00:18:34.101
After all, I've got dinner to make!

00:18:34.101 --> 00:18:36.036
You're the best, Ella!

00:18:36.036 --> 00:18:37.704
Chao chao chao chao!

00:18:37.704 --> 00:18:39.106
[Bell rings]

00:18:39.673 --> 00:18:42.576
Not exactly what I'd call
a challenge, but here goes.

00:18:42.576 --> 00:18:44.478
[Grunting]

00:18:44.478 --> 00:18:45.445
Oh, yeah?

00:18:46.446 --> 00:18:47.281
Ha!

00:18:47.281 --> 00:18:48.849
[Sounds of fighting]

00:18:48.849 --> 00:18:51.351
This exciting grudge
match is up and running.

00:18:51.351 --> 00:18:53.353
Or should I say flying?

00:18:53.353 --> 00:18:55.889
You're not bad... for an amateur.

00:18:55.889 --> 00:18:58.725
[Sounds of fighting]

00:18:58.725 --> 00:19:00.127
Watch out, boy.

00:19:00.127 --> 00:19:01.628
Uh... huh?

00:19:01.628 --> 00:19:03.063
[Smooch] [Screams]

00:19:03.063 --> 00:19:06.233
Well it looks like Rouge the Bat
sure gave Tails the kiss-off.

00:19:06.233 --> 00:19:08.335
That makes her the
winner of this match!

00:19:08.335 --> 00:19:09.636
Sorry to smooch and run,

00:19:09.636 --> 00:19:11.238
but I've got to
touch-up my lipstick.

00:19:11.238 --> 00:19:12.673
[Chuckling]

00:19:12.673 --> 00:19:13.573
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:19:13.573 --> 00:19:16.343
we're now down to the final
battle of the second round.

00:19:16.343 --> 00:19:19.646
This next match-up promises to
be a <i>real</i> crowd-pleaser!

00:19:19.646 --> 00:19:21.181
Let's see what happens!

00:19:21.715 --> 00:19:23.784
I never wanted this to happen.

00:19:23.784 --> 00:19:25.152
Just think!

00:19:26.119 --> 00:19:28.121
Me against Sonic!

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.629
How can I do this?

00:19:36.096 --> 00:19:39.966
How can I fight someone
I care for so much?

00:19:40.701 --> 00:19:41.835
Sonic!

00:19:42.469 --> 00:19:43.770
This won't work.

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:46.673
You gotta think of some way
to get her mad at me, Chris!

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.842
Don't look at me!

00:19:48.842 --> 00:19:51.745
And I can tell he doesn't
want to fight with me either!

00:19:52.746 --> 00:19:54.081
'Cause he cares!

00:19:54.081 --> 00:19:55.248
Woah!

00:19:55.248 --> 00:19:57.017
Chris, please! Help me out!

00:19:57.017 --> 00:20:00.120
When she's acting like this,
nothing can get her mad!

00:20:03.357 --> 00:20:04.524
Huh?

00:20:04.524 --> 00:20:05.625
That's Sonic!

00:20:05.625 --> 00:20:07.561
I'd better check this out.

00:20:09.162 --> 00:20:11.331
Sonic, I understand...

00:20:11.331 --> 00:20:13.266
Understand what?

00:20:13.266 --> 00:20:14.334
Woah!

00:20:15.035 --> 00:20:16.269
Say goodbye!

00:20:17.404 --> 00:20:18.572
Woah! Huh?

00:20:18.572 --> 00:20:19.539
Huh?

00:20:21.708 --> 00:20:22.275
[Grunt]

00:20:22.275 --> 00:20:24.945
Oh, Sonic. You really
do care about me!

00:20:24.945 --> 00:20:25.946
Missed!

00:20:25.946 --> 00:20:27.848
Where do you think you're going?

00:20:28.281 --> 00:20:29.449
[Gasp]

00:20:29.449 --> 00:20:30.984
Sonic...

00:20:31.418 --> 00:20:32.386
Oh well...

00:20:32.386 --> 00:20:35.288
At least now I know
how he feels about me.

00:20:35.722 --> 00:20:39.226
[Sigh] More trouble with Eggman.

00:20:39.226 --> 00:20:40.961
What a shocker, folks!

00:20:40.961 --> 00:20:43.330
Our friend Sonic has
forfeited the match!

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:45.632
And that means we're
down to the final eight!

00:20:50.203 --> 00:20:51.405
Who'll be the winner?

00:20:51.405 --> 00:20:53.774
Tune in next time to find out!
