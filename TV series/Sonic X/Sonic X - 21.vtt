[Snoring]

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:17.551
[Engine turns over]

00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:19.653
[Snoring continues]

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:25.058
[All snoring]

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.161
[Rumble]

00:00:28.262 --> 00:00:30.564
[Gasps]
What's that?!

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.601
[Engine turns off]

00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:39.973
Hah!

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:41.275
Hyah!

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.444
Back off!
Relax!

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:46.847
Lighten up.
It's me.

00:00:46.947 --> 00:00:48.382
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:49.850
Blast it, Sam.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.020
Don't you have any idea
what time it is?

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.022
Sure, I do.
It's morning.

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:57.524
It's 3:00 A. M.

00:00:57.624 --> 00:00:59.293
So, it's a little early.

00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:01.395
You're lucky I held myself back.

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:04.932
I was just about to batter you
like a chicken cutlet.

00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:07.200
I'm going back to bed.

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:11.071
I hope you didn't wake
the neighbors.

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:12.272
Huh?

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:13.440
Hmm.

00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:21.114
[Sarcastically] Nice.
They're all up.

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:22.482
Huh?

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:28.188
[Moaning]

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:30.424
What's going on?

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:31.658
Huh?

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:34.428
Where'd all those people
come from?

00:01:34.528 --> 00:01:35.562
SONIC:
I don't know.

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:38.398
Looks like they're lined up
for a parade.

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:43.103
Hey, Sam, isn't that a new car?

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.480
I'm here to challenge Sonic
to a road race.

00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:54.648
- A race?
- A race?

00:01:54.748 --> 00:01:58.151
Hold on.
This is a rocket engine.

00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:01.154
That's the SS-3
Super Rocket Engine.

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:03.156
It was designed by top engineers

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:05.359
at the Office
of Science and Technology.

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:08.929
Over a billion dollars
went into its development.

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:11.932
[Engine turns over]

00:02:12.032 --> 00:02:15.135
Sonic, I'm gonna prove
once and for all

00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:17.838
I'm the fastest guy
on the planet!

00:02:18.672 --> 00:02:20.240
Go, go, go, go, go

00:02:20.374 --> 00:02:21.808
Gotta go fast

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:23.977
Gotta go fast

00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:27.047
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:02:28.682 --> 00:02:32.119
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:33.920
Got ourselves a situation

00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:36.223
Stuck in a new location

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:39.760
Without any explanation

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.895
No talk of relaxation

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.530
Don't, don't, don't

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.298
Don't blink, don't think

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:47.100
Just go, go, go, go

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.568
Go, go

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:54.107
Sonic is on the run

00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:56.043
Sonic, he's number one

00:02:56.143 --> 00:02:59.780
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.281
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:03.283
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:05.852
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:07.754
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:10.123
Sonic X

00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:12.959
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.995
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:03:15.095 --> 00:03:16.897
Sonic X

00:03:21.457 --> 00:03:25.261
Sonic, are you gonna race
against my Uncle Sam?

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:28.831
No way.

00:03:28.964 --> 00:03:29.965
Hey, wait!

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.168
You know, for a hedgehog,
you sure are spineless.

00:03:33.302 --> 00:03:35.671
Hey, Sonic, we have a race.

00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:37.239
Huh?!

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:38.841
Huh?

00:03:39.808 --> 00:03:41.744
Morning already?

00:03:41.844 --> 00:03:44.313
Sonic says he won't race.

00:03:44.413 --> 00:03:45.981
See?

00:03:46.081 --> 00:03:47.383
Huh?

00:03:48.584 --> 00:03:50.486
He will race.

00:03:50.586 --> 00:03:53.489
The starting line will be
in front of this house.

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:55.424
From here, we'll speed downtown,

00:03:55.524 --> 00:03:57.459
straight through the heart
of Station Square.

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:00.496
After we blast across the bridge
out of the city,

00:04:00.596 --> 00:04:02.231
the competition
will really heat up

00:04:02.364 --> 00:04:03.465
as we zoom through the desert

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.502
and navigate the twists
and turns of the canyon.

00:04:06.602 --> 00:04:09.505
A hairpin turn
will lead us back to the city.

00:04:09.605 --> 00:04:12.508
The winner will be the one
who reaches the stadium first.

00:04:12.608 --> 00:04:15.144
There'll be thousands of fans
to cheer us on,

00:04:15.244 --> 00:04:17.513
including the president
waiting at the finish line.

00:04:17.613 --> 00:04:18.981
The president?

00:04:19.081 --> 00:04:22.518
He's gonna congratulate
the winner on live TV.

00:04:22.618 --> 00:04:25.521
The coverage will increase
his poll numbers.

00:04:25.621 --> 00:04:29.158
The president is sure to win
re-election in a landslide.

00:04:29.258 --> 00:04:31.093
But why would the government

00:04:31.226 --> 00:04:34.430
let Uncle Sam use their rocket
for a race with Sonic?

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.232
The S-3 was expensive,
and they think the race

00:04:37.366 --> 00:04:39.835
will increase taxpayer support
for the project.

00:04:39.968 --> 00:04:42.037
Yeah, you got it.

00:04:42.171 --> 00:04:44.106
Except we're not gonna race.

00:04:44.206 --> 00:04:46.942
Oh?
What's the matter, Sonic?

00:04:47.042 --> 00:04:48.944
Are you afraid that,
when our race is over,

00:04:49.044 --> 00:04:52.081
you'll be known as the second
fastest guy on the planet?

00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:54.883
I'm not gonna take no
for an answer, Sonic,

00:04:54.983 --> 00:04:58.087
and I won't let up
until you agree to race me!

00:04:58.187 --> 00:05:00.589
Why couldn't I have
a normal family?

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:04.126
Look, Sam, you can't expect
Station Square to shut down

00:05:04.226 --> 00:05:05.828
just so you two can have a race.

00:05:05.928 --> 00:05:08.063
Oh, yeah?
You want to bet?

00:05:08.197 --> 00:05:12.334
They're just about ready for the
big race here at Station Square.

00:05:12.434 --> 00:05:15.337
The streets will soon be
completely clear of traffic,

00:05:15.437 --> 00:05:18.407
and an enormous crowd is
gathering all along the course,

00:05:18.507 --> 00:05:20.342
waiting for the race to start.

00:05:20.442 --> 00:05:21.844
Wow.

00:05:21.944 --> 00:05:25.047
They're cheering now for
the sponsors of today's race.

00:05:25.147 --> 00:05:27.549
The popular movie star
Lindsey Fair

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:30.853
and her husband mogul husband,
Nelson Thorndyke.

00:05:30.953 --> 00:05:32.755
This keeps getting worse.

00:05:32.855 --> 00:05:35.224
I'll bet my nightcap
that your uncle's the one

00:05:35.357 --> 00:05:37.826
who got them involved
in this ridiculous race.

00:05:37.926 --> 00:05:41.563
Well, Sonic, you're not gonna
disappoint that crowd, are you?

00:05:41.697 --> 00:05:44.767
They've been waiting for hours
to see us go human-to-hedgehog.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:45.868
Tough.

00:05:45.968 --> 00:05:48.804
Ugh!
Come on!

00:05:53.776 --> 00:05:55.244
[Sighs]

00:05:55.344 --> 00:05:57.179
Hello, my dear.

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:59.581
[Smooching]

00:05:59.681 --> 00:06:01.216
Mmm.

00:06:02.918 --> 00:06:04.119
[Telephone rings]

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:05.421
Aah!

00:06:05.521 --> 00:06:06.688
Ugh!

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:08.690
Ugh. Oh.

00:06:09.358 --> 00:06:11.393
Yeah?
Who's this?

00:06:11.527 --> 00:06:13.695
SAM: Sonic won't race me!
Do something!

00:06:13.829 --> 00:06:16.231
The president should
order him to compete!

00:06:16.331 --> 00:06:17.566
Who is this?

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:19.168
[Dial tone]

00:06:19.268 --> 00:06:20.502
Huh.

00:06:21.103 --> 00:06:22.638
[Yawns]

00:06:22.771 --> 00:06:24.740
Sonic won't race.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.009
Hmm, that's too bad.

00:06:27.109 --> 00:06:29.111
But if he won't race...

00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:31.380
[Yawns]

00:06:33.549 --> 00:06:34.850
What?!

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:39.855
If Sonic doesn't race Sam Speed,
my career's over.

00:06:39.955 --> 00:06:42.057
ALL: The president lied
about the race,

00:06:42.157 --> 00:06:43.792
so kick him out in disgrace!

00:06:43.926 --> 00:06:45.994
NELSON: The president
will probably be impeached

00:06:46.128 --> 00:06:47.429
before the next election,

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:50.933
and all because
Sonic won't race.

00:06:51.033 --> 00:06:52.901
We've got to do something!

00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:55.471
We'll call out the military!

00:06:55.604 --> 00:06:57.005
The Army.

00:06:57.105 --> 00:06:58.540
The Navy.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.042
And the Air Force!

00:07:00.142 --> 00:07:02.010
[Laughing evilly]

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.013
That should help convince Sonic
to change his mind!

00:07:05.113 --> 00:07:07.816
No, the Secretary of Defense

00:07:07.916 --> 00:07:10.352
will probably
make a fuss about it.

00:07:10.452 --> 00:07:13.755
I know!
I'll go over his head!

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:33.041
And that is checkmate.

00:07:33.141 --> 00:07:35.544
[Growls]
You cheater!

00:07:35.644 --> 00:07:37.045
Loser.

00:07:37.145 --> 00:07:38.247
What?!

00:07:38.347 --> 00:07:41.049
I built you,
and I can unbuild you.

00:07:41.149 --> 00:07:43.118
Ugh!
Ugh!

00:07:43.218 --> 00:07:45.854
I'll checkmate you!

00:07:45.954 --> 00:07:48.056
You pawn!

00:07:48.156 --> 00:07:52.060
I promise that I will let you
win next time, Doctor.

00:07:52.194 --> 00:07:54.429
There won't be a next time.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:55.564
Huh?

00:07:55.697 --> 00:07:57.332
[Beeping]

00:07:57.432 --> 00:08:00.602
Dr. Eggman, I have
a proposition for you.

00:08:00.702 --> 00:08:02.604
Oh, yeah?
Who are you?

00:08:02.704 --> 00:08:04.339
That doesn't matter.

00:08:04.439 --> 00:08:07.609
Now, you want to settle
the score with Sonic?

00:08:07.709 --> 00:08:08.744
Huh?

00:08:08.844 --> 00:08:10.612
Yes. Maybe.

00:08:10.712 --> 00:08:13.582
What if I told you that Sonic
had been challenged to race

00:08:13.682 --> 00:08:16.618
against a high-tech rocket car
designed by the government?

00:08:16.718 --> 00:08:19.121
Really?
Is that so?

00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:21.723
In fact, Sonic is so scared
he'll be defeated

00:08:21.823 --> 00:08:23.592
that he turned us down.

00:08:23.725 --> 00:08:24.426
Aah!

00:08:24.526 --> 00:08:27.229
And so you need me
to get Sonic in the race?

00:08:27.329 --> 00:08:28.630
That's it?

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.766
You convince Sonic
to enter that race,

00:08:30.899 --> 00:08:33.635
and I'll get you front-row seats
to an ice show.

00:08:33.735 --> 00:08:37.706
Are you nuts?
An ice show?

00:08:37.806 --> 00:08:38.941
I love figure skating!

00:08:39.041 --> 00:08:40.342
Oh, please, can we go?

00:08:40.442 --> 00:08:42.477
We will work day and night
without complaining.

00:08:42.578 --> 00:08:45.180
Not even behind your back
like we usually do.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.482
Hmm.
All right.

00:08:47.583 --> 00:08:50.452
But how do I know this isn't
some kind of elaborate trick

00:08:50.552 --> 00:08:52.387
you're playing on me?

00:08:53.855 --> 00:08:56.592
Look in my eyes,
and you'll see I'm sincere.

00:08:56.725 --> 00:08:57.359
[Both gasp]

00:08:57.459 --> 00:08:59.528
Well, then, I'll do it.

00:08:59.628 --> 00:09:01.630
I'll need a robot to stop Sonic.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.131
Me?

00:09:03.265 --> 00:09:04.600
I'll rebuild this one

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.136
into a model that forces Sonic
to enter the race.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:12.574
No! Please, Doctor!
Not me!

00:09:16.778 --> 00:09:17.879
It's cool.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:19.681
It does look fast.

00:09:19.781 --> 00:09:23.118
My Uncle Sam wouldn't drive it
it if wasn't cool and fast.

00:09:23.218 --> 00:09:25.687
[Bokkun laughing]

00:09:27.089 --> 00:09:28.423
Oh, brother.

00:09:28.523 --> 00:09:30.859
Where's Sonic?
I have to see him now.

00:09:30.959 --> 00:09:33.328
I brought a message with me.

00:09:35.297 --> 00:09:37.366
Wake up.
I have a message for you.

00:09:37.499 --> 00:09:38.467
Huh? [Gasps]

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.735
Relax.

00:09:39.835 --> 00:09:42.838
I promise this one
isn't gonna blow up in the end.

00:09:42.938 --> 00:09:45.374
All right.
What is it?

00:09:45.474 --> 00:09:47.709
You better enter that race,
Sonic,

00:09:47.809 --> 00:09:50.278
or else you'll
have to face this.

00:09:50.379 --> 00:09:51.847
Hi, there.

00:09:51.947 --> 00:09:53.348
Mmm.

00:09:53.448 --> 00:09:55.484
[Smooching]

00:09:58.587 --> 00:09:59.855
Aah!

00:09:59.955 --> 00:10:01.690
[Laughing]

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:02.190
Huh?

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.660
[Laughing]

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:05.661
Ugh!

00:10:07.729 --> 00:10:09.031
Aah!

00:10:09.798 --> 00:10:11.700
[Laughing]

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.335
[Smooching]

00:10:13.435 --> 00:10:16.872
Yuck. I don't want to
take any lip from that robot.

00:10:17.005 --> 00:10:19.441
[Laughing]

00:10:21.443 --> 00:10:23.445
[Engine turns over]

00:10:26.281 --> 00:10:27.516
Huh?

00:10:30.252 --> 00:10:32.921
I'm not gonna take no
for an answer, Sonic,

00:10:33.021 --> 00:10:36.124
and I won't let up
until you agree to race me!

00:10:36.224 --> 00:10:37.893
[Laughing]

00:10:38.026 --> 00:10:39.861
Then I'll race.

00:10:40.729 --> 00:10:42.631
Aah!
[Crying]

00:10:46.234 --> 00:10:48.236
[Engine revving]

00:10:49.838 --> 00:10:51.973
Are you gonna play with
that pedal all day?

00:10:52.074 --> 00:10:53.241
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:10:53.341 --> 00:10:55.243
Or are we gonna have a race?

00:10:55.343 --> 00:10:57.212
Hmm.

00:11:09.257 --> 00:11:10.692
I just don't get it.

00:11:10.826 --> 00:11:12.994
What made Sonic change his mind?

00:11:13.128 --> 00:11:15.097
I guess he couldn't
resist the challenge.

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:16.965
On your mark.

00:11:17.099 --> 00:11:18.467
Get set.

00:11:18.567 --> 00:11:19.935
[Chuckles]

00:11:20.035 --> 00:11:21.002
Go!

00:11:23.759 --> 00:11:24.893
Ugh!

00:11:29.398 --> 00:11:33.268
This is Scarlet Garcia
reporting from News Chopper One.

00:11:33.368 --> 00:11:35.070
We now continue
our live coverage

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:36.638
of the road race of the century,

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:39.274
as Sonic the Hedgehog
takes on Sam Speed.

00:11:39.374 --> 00:11:40.676
After a delayed start,

00:11:40.776 --> 00:11:42.511
the racers left
the Thorndyke mansion

00:11:42.644 --> 00:11:46.014
and are now speeding
through downtown Station Square.

00:11:47.883 --> 00:11:48.951
Hey, Sam.

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:50.285
Yeah, what?

00:11:50.385 --> 00:11:52.521
I thought this was
supposed to be a road race,

00:11:52.621 --> 00:11:55.324
but your rocket car doesn't
even touch the asphalt.

00:11:55.424 --> 00:11:56.291
What's up?

00:11:56.391 --> 00:11:59.294
That thing
doesn't even have wheels.

00:11:59.394 --> 00:12:02.097
Yeah?
Look close.

00:12:02.197 --> 00:12:03.198
Huh?

00:12:09.271 --> 00:12:12.007
You see, the wheels
guide the glide.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.675
What if you get a flat?

00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:15.277
Our racers are about to enter

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:16.845
the most dangerous part
of the course

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:18.981
as they steer through
these narrow streets

00:12:19.114 --> 00:12:20.582
at super-high speed.

00:12:20.682 --> 00:12:22.818
But is the rocket car
maneuverable enough

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:25.087
to make those
hypervelocity turns?

00:12:25.187 --> 00:12:26.655
It'll be easy.

00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:29.658
Oh, yeah?
Then prove it.

00:12:32.694 --> 00:12:35.631
Great.
Sonic's gone way ahead.

00:12:35.731 --> 00:12:38.600
Commence Project Straightaway
now.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.469
Roger.

00:12:53.782 --> 00:12:55.918
[Laughs]

00:12:56.018 --> 00:12:58.420
Sorry, Sonic,
but being chief of the "S" Team

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.523
gives me the kind of clout that
really opens doors in this city.

00:13:01.623 --> 00:13:02.691
[Laughs]

00:13:07.296 --> 00:13:09.197
[Gasping]

00:13:15.904 --> 00:13:17.506
That wasn't fair.

00:13:17.606 --> 00:13:19.274
Tough luck.

00:13:20.876 --> 00:13:22.044
Oh!

00:13:22.144 --> 00:13:24.246
Get off of my hood, Sonic!

00:13:24.379 --> 00:13:27.316
Ah, nice breeze here.

00:13:27.416 --> 00:13:29.818
Hitching a ride
is against the rules!

00:13:29.918 --> 00:13:31.320
Tough luck.

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.255
Ugh!

00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:34.723
Ha!

00:13:34.823 --> 00:13:39.494
Okay, you got me, but would you
mind moving to the back some

00:13:39.594 --> 00:13:41.296
so I can see where I'm going?

00:13:41.396 --> 00:13:42.397
Huh?

00:13:43.498 --> 00:13:45.233
Thank you.

00:13:47.302 --> 00:13:48.537
Right here?

00:13:48.637 --> 00:13:50.405
Further back.

00:13:52.341 --> 00:13:53.308
How's this?

00:13:53.442 --> 00:13:55.877
Great. Right there
will do just fine.

00:13:56.011 --> 00:13:57.913
[Chuckles]

00:13:58.013 --> 00:13:59.481
Aah!

00:14:01.116 --> 00:14:03.552
[Laughs]
Bye, Sonic.

00:14:03.652 --> 00:14:05.687
Strange.
What's Sonic doing?

00:14:05.787 --> 00:14:07.489
Why is he going the wrong way?

00:14:07.589 --> 00:14:10.525
It certainly is an odd tactic.

00:14:10.625 --> 00:14:11.526
[Laughs evilly]

00:14:11.626 --> 00:14:14.696
That rocket car
is my kind of mean machine.

00:14:14.796 --> 00:14:17.733
Have to try that spring trick
on Sonic myself.

00:14:17.833 --> 00:14:21.570
Okay, go, Sumo Man.

00:14:24.773 --> 00:14:27.309
Huh?
That that can't be Sonic.

00:14:27.442 --> 00:14:28.377
Huh?

00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:35.650
You may not pass.

00:14:35.784 --> 00:14:37.552
Turn back.

00:14:37.652 --> 00:14:39.054
A roadblock?

00:14:39.154 --> 00:14:40.555
Hey!

00:14:42.591 --> 00:14:46.094
Turn back or be destroyed!

00:14:46.194 --> 00:14:48.063
[Grunts]

00:14:48.163 --> 00:14:50.032
Take that!

00:14:52.401 --> 00:14:53.802
Sucker.

00:14:55.637 --> 00:14:58.940
Huh?
Stop now!

00:15:00.075 --> 00:15:03.612
I order you to halt
and reverse your course now!

00:15:03.712 --> 00:15:05.213
Ugh!

00:15:06.915 --> 00:15:08.884
How could I have missed Sonic?

00:15:08.984 --> 00:15:11.119
Dr. Eggman will punish me.

00:15:11.219 --> 00:15:13.088
I had better punish myself
first.

00:15:13.188 --> 00:15:14.890
Ugh!

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.328
Aah!

00:15:20.429 --> 00:15:22.597
That robot kissed me!

00:15:22.697 --> 00:15:25.867
Bokkun, it might have been
a lot worse, you know.

00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:29.237
You could have been accidentally
kissed by Dr. Eggman.

00:15:29.337 --> 00:15:30.605
What a revolting thought.

00:15:30.705 --> 00:15:32.307
We blew it.

00:15:32.441 --> 00:15:35.911
Well, don't blame me.
I did my job.

00:15:36.044 --> 00:15:38.580
Kiss off, you clown!

00:15:40.348 --> 00:15:42.517
Aah!

00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:54.629
Are you all right?
Let me kiss and make it better.

00:15:54.729 --> 00:15:56.298
[Smooching]

00:15:56.398 --> 00:15:57.833
[Growling]

00:16:02.404 --> 00:16:05.340
Wow, it's already lunchtime.

00:16:11.213 --> 00:16:12.447
Huh?

00:16:13.815 --> 00:16:16.184
Hey, you want a bite?

00:16:16.284 --> 00:16:18.153
No, thanks.

00:16:19.621 --> 00:16:23.258
Come to think of it,
I am pretty hungry.

00:16:23.358 --> 00:16:24.593
CHRIS:
Hey, Sonic!

00:16:24.693 --> 00:16:25.560
Huh?

00:16:28.663 --> 00:16:32.067
Ella sent some ham sandwiches
and milk for you.

00:16:32.167 --> 00:16:34.870
Wow, thanks, Chris.
That looks...

00:16:35.504 --> 00:16:36.738
- Ohh.
- Ohh.

00:16:38.173 --> 00:16:40.075
My bad.
[Chuckles]

00:16:40.175 --> 00:16:42.244
I'll pass on the sandwich.

00:16:42.344 --> 00:16:45.480
Sorry, Sonic.
See you at the finish line.

00:16:45.614 --> 00:16:46.581
Right.

00:16:52.521 --> 00:16:54.623
This road race
is still up for grabs

00:16:54.723 --> 00:16:57.926
as our racers prepare
to speed through the canyon.

00:17:19.986 --> 00:17:22.088
Our racers
have reached the halfway point

00:17:22.188 --> 00:17:24.691
and are now speeding back
toward Station Square.

00:17:24.791 --> 00:17:28.428
Sonic and Sam Speed are still
running neck and neck.

00:17:35.902 --> 00:17:38.137
What's taking the president
so long?

00:17:38.237 --> 00:17:40.640
The race
is going to finish soon.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.742
[Ringing]

00:17:45.278 --> 00:17:47.347
Hello?

00:17:47.914 --> 00:17:48.881
What?!

00:17:48.982 --> 00:17:49.882
But can't the president

00:17:49.983 --> 00:17:52.819
hold his emergency
security meeting later?

00:17:52.919 --> 00:17:56.222
All right,
if it can't be changed.

00:17:56.823 --> 00:17:58.157
I'll fill in.

00:17:58.257 --> 00:17:59.892
It's just as well.

00:17:59.993 --> 00:18:02.195
I'm more photogenic
than the president anyway.

00:18:02.295 --> 00:18:05.631
In fact, I'm more lovable
than my boring boss, too.

00:18:05.732 --> 00:18:08.434
I can use this race
to launch my own campaign!

00:18:08.534 --> 00:18:11.904
Then the world
will call me Mr. President!

00:18:12.005 --> 00:18:13.506
[Laughing]

00:18:15.008 --> 00:18:16.609
AMY:
What are you laughing at?

00:18:16.709 --> 00:18:18.611
Huh?!
Huh?

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.482
Oh, nothing.

00:18:22.582 --> 00:18:24.617
[Laughing]

00:18:26.786 --> 00:18:30.156
Now the two challengers
are racing into the city

00:18:30.256 --> 00:18:31.791
and pulling out all the stops

00:18:31.891 --> 00:18:33.693
as they speed
toward the stadium!

00:18:33.793 --> 00:18:35.828
[Cheering]

00:18:38.765 --> 00:18:39.866
[Grunting]

00:18:44.437 --> 00:18:45.838
[Grunting]

00:18:45.938 --> 00:18:47.306
Come on, Sonic.

00:18:47.407 --> 00:18:49.409
All right.

00:18:49.509 --> 00:18:52.545
It's rocket time!

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:57.116
Look out!
Sam Speed is pulling away!

00:18:57.216 --> 00:18:59.385
Oh, yeah?

Well, it looks like
we have a tie.

That was close.

they can determine a winner.

The results will be posted
on the stadium monitor.

00:19:37.723 --> 00:19:39.325
Amazing!

00:19:39.425 --> 00:19:42.228
Sonic not only
crossed the finish line first,

00:19:42.328 --> 00:19:44.097
he went back for an encore!

00:19:44.197 --> 00:19:45.898
Sonic is the winner!

Aw, it's no big deal.

00:19:54.707 --> 00:19:56.075
LINDSEY:
Oh, Sonic.

00:19:56.209 --> 00:19:57.410

Well done.

Thanks a lot.

00:20:02.315 --> 00:20:03.449
Hmm?

That was just great.

00:20:21.033 --> 00:20:22.869
Sonic, shake my hand.

00:20:22.969 --> 00:20:26.038
Hurry up so they can
take our picture together.

Oh, hi, there, Vivian.

00:20:32.612 --> 00:20:33.179
What?!

00:20:33.312 --> 00:20:36.382
I'm under investigation for
negotiating with Dr. Eggman?!

00:20:36.516 --> 00:20:37.483
Ugh!

00:20:37.583 --> 00:20:39.485
- Over here.
- Right here.

00:20:39.585 --> 00:20:43.189
Oh! There's no way
I'll be president now!

00:20:43.289 --> 00:20:44.891
Ugh!
