00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.635
Last time on Sonic X,

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:03.504
Chris was trapped on Space Colony ARK,

00:00:03.504 --> 00:00:05.372
but Sonic rocketed to his rescue!

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:07.641
Soon, Eggman ambushed the hapless hedgehog

00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:09.176
and gave our hero the heave-ho.

00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:11.211
The devious doc issued an ultimatum.

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:12.880
If he wasn't made supreme ruler,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.481
he'd pulverize the planet!

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.416
But when Eggman fired up the Eclipse Cannon,

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:18.485
he got a blastĂ˘from the past!

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:20.687
A recording from his grandfather,
Professor Robotnik,

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.123
revealed that he had his own
plan to wipe out the world.

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:25.325
Can Sonic save the globe from destruction?

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:27.027
Or will Robotnik wreak his revenge?

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:29.196
Find out next on Sonic X!

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:31.798
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:34.868
Gotta go fast

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:37.804
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:43.610
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.679
Got ourselves a situation

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.714
Stuck in a new location

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:51.318
Without any explanation

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.387
No talk of relaxation

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.055
Don't, don't, don't

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:56.857
Don't blink, don't think

00:00:56.857 --> 00:00:58.659
Just go, go, go, go

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.160
Go, go

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.699
Sonic is on the run

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:07.568
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:11.271
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:14.975
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:17.377

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:19.279
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:21.782
Sonic X

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:23.750
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:26.553
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:27.588
Sonic X

00:01:33.251 --> 00:01:37.122
Topaz, I'm transmitting my report now. Over.

00:01:37.823 --> 00:01:39.524
Be careful, Rouge.

00:01:39.524 --> 00:01:41.693
That space colony is a dangerous place.

00:01:41.693 --> 00:01:42.661
Ugh!

00:01:43.528 --> 00:01:44.529
Huh?

00:01:44.863 --> 00:01:46.431
Uhh!

00:01:47.265 --> 00:01:48.000
[Grunt]

00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:54.106
Oh!

00:01:55.507 --> 00:01:58.010
You've interfered for the last time.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.111
[Grunt]

00:01:59.745 --> 00:02:02.014
[Sounds of fighting]

00:02:02.781 --> 00:02:03.515
Huh.

00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:07.185
Huh!

00:02:07.185 --> 00:02:08.086
[Grunt]

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.888
Oof!

00:02:09.888 --> 00:02:10.856
[Grunt] [Grunt]

00:02:13.125 --> 00:02:14.726
All right, Shadow!

00:02:14.726 --> 00:02:16.395
What's goin' on here?

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:18.864
You'll find out.

00:02:18.864 --> 00:02:20.165
Woah!

00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:21.833
Woah!

00:02:22.801 --> 00:02:25.637
Sonic! Your time is running out!

00:02:26.905 --> 00:02:27.906
Wait!

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.341
Huh?

00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:32.911
[Beeping]

00:02:35.647 --> 00:02:36.982
He tricked me!

00:02:36.982 --> 00:02:39.151
My own grandfather tricked me.

00:02:42.187 --> 00:02:43.922
The Chaos Emeralds!

00:02:43.922 --> 00:02:45.624
[Grunting]

00:02:46.258 --> 00:02:49.895
The countdown marking my
final revenge has begun!

00:02:49.895 --> 00:02:52.764
In a few minutes, you will be destroyed!

00:02:52.764 --> 00:02:55.667
Space Colony ARK will hurtle
through the atmosphere

00:02:55.667 --> 00:02:59.938
and crash into this planet
with devastating force.

00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:03.508
You have no time to prevent this disaster,

00:03:03.508 --> 00:03:06.411
and absolutely no hope of survival!

00:03:06.411 --> 00:03:09.514
Your rulers took my
granddaughter Maria from me,

00:03:10.515 --> 00:03:13.919
so I'm destroying everything you care about.

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:17.789
Now you'll feel what I
felt when I lost Maria.

00:03:20.692 --> 00:03:22.227
You'll see.

00:03:23.095 --> 00:03:23.929
[Crackle]

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:25.297
You'll see.

00:03:25.297 --> 00:03:26.231
You'll see!

00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:27.766
Who is that guy?

00:03:27.766 --> 00:03:29.701
And what does he mean?

00:03:29.701 --> 00:03:32.604
That is Professor Gerald Robotnik.

00:03:32.604 --> 00:03:36.374
He was a scientific genius,
and my grandfather.

00:03:36.875 --> 00:03:39.211
The countdown marking my
final revenge has begun!

00:03:39.211 --> 00:03:41.813
Hey! It feels like this
place is breaking apart!

00:03:41.813 --> 00:03:44.416
Soon, it's going to get a lot worse.

00:03:44.416 --> 00:03:47.419
I just checked the colony's
propulsion systems.

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:48.854
The computers are locked,

00:03:48.854 --> 00:03:50.689
so we can't reverse course.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.592
Looks like there's nothing we can do.

00:03:53.592 --> 00:03:56.928
and absolutely no hope of survival!

00:03:56.928 --> 00:03:58.063
Your rulers took my-

00:03:58.063 --> 00:04:00.866
Grandpa. Destroying a planet is one thing,

00:04:00.866 --> 00:04:03.135
but destroying your grandson is another.

00:04:03.802 --> 00:04:05.403
What's going on here?

00:04:05.403 --> 00:04:06.538
Sonic!

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:09.341
If you came here for a
showdown, Sonic, forget it!

00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:11.143
Soon we'll all be vaporized.

00:04:11.143 --> 00:04:14.045
Come on. Don't be such a quitter, Eggman.

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:15.313
Maybe if we worked together,

00:04:15.313 --> 00:04:16.915
we can get out of this mess.

00:04:17.916 --> 00:04:21.253
The countdown marking my
final revenge has begun!

00:04:21.253 --> 00:04:23.522
When I hacked into the
database on Prison Island,

00:04:23.522 --> 00:04:25.423
I found my grandfather's diary.

00:04:26.758 --> 00:04:30.228
"Revenge. That is all
that matters to me now."

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:35.233
"When I began my research,
I only wanted to do good."

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:38.737
That's why I worked to make
the Ultimate Creature.

00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:41.006
But the leaders of the project worried

00:04:41.006 --> 00:04:43.542
that I'd use it to take over the world.

00:04:43.542 --> 00:04:47.412
So they seized my lab on Space Colony ARK.

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:50.315
Then, they took Maria from me,

00:04:50.315 --> 00:04:53.552
and my life took on a new purpose.

00:04:53.552 --> 00:04:55.453
Instead of helping people,

00:04:55.453 --> 00:04:57.689
I would get revenge on them!

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:59.424
Night and day, I've planned.

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:01.426
So long after I am gone,

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:03.929
my revenge will be complete.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.433
"I've done it. My greatest
design is now complete.

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:10.368
The Ultimate Creature, Shadow.

00:05:10.368 --> 00:05:12.537
My enemies think they've defeated me,

00:05:12.537 --> 00:05:15.373
but Shadow will carry out
my orders without question.

00:05:15.373 --> 00:05:16.675
Now it sleeps,

00:05:16.675 --> 00:05:19.311
but one day in the future,
it will be reawakened.

00:05:19.311 --> 00:05:22.514
Shadow will bring total destruction."

00:05:23.481 --> 00:05:24.916
[Beeping]

00:05:24.916 --> 00:05:28.420
In the coming minutes, as you
helplessly await your doom-

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.255
Do we have any confirmation of this?

00:05:30.255 --> 00:05:33.825
You just received a high priority message
from the director of the space agency,

00:05:33.825 --> 00:05:34.960
Mr. President.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.296
Space Colony ARK is moving towards
the planet at high speed.

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:39.998
The impact will be catastrophic,

00:05:39.998 --> 00:05:41.867
and will cause massive destruction.

00:05:41.867 --> 00:05:43.435
But if that colony hits us,

00:05:43.435 --> 00:05:45.403
millions of lives are going to be lost!

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:48.840
Good luck, Sonic.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.743
Even you're gonna have
trouble saving us this time.

00:05:52.377 --> 00:05:56.715
[Robotnik's tape loops in the background]

00:05:56.715 --> 00:05:58.483
Hey, freeze!

00:05:58.483 --> 00:05:59.451
[Grunt]

00:05:59.985 --> 00:06:02.053
This is a warrant for your arrest.

00:06:02.053 --> 00:06:04.689
It took a long time, but the truth is out!

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:07.325
The secret group inside
the intelligence agency

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:09.361
had all records of Project Shadow.

00:06:09.361 --> 00:06:11.930
We didn't have a clue until Dr. Eggman

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.165
hacked into their system
and accessed the file.

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:17.602
Good things do come from bad, sometimes.

00:06:21.573 --> 00:06:23.508
The energy from the Chaos Emeralds

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:26.411
has transformed the Eclipse
Cannon into a mega-bomb.

00:06:26.411 --> 00:06:27.712
If it detonates,

00:06:27.712 --> 00:06:31.283
the blast will be more
massive than a supernova.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.551
The energy from the Chaos Emeralds

00:06:33.551 --> 00:06:36.087
is also what's pushing us toward the planet!

00:06:36.087 --> 00:06:38.990
We have to get the Emeralds
and deactivate them somehow!

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.225

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:42.694
Huh?

00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:44.396
What? Why me?

00:06:44.396 --> 00:06:47.999
Because, you can control all
the Chaos Emeralds with that.

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:50.101
The Master Emerald!

00:06:50.101 --> 00:06:52.604
I can use it to shut off the power!

00:06:52.604 --> 00:06:55.507
There's still time to stop the
space colony from crashing,

00:06:55.507 --> 00:06:56.474
but we have to hurry!

00:06:56.474 --> 00:06:59.644
We'll only reach the Chaos
Emeralds if we all work together!

00:06:59.644 --> 00:07:00.679
I'll lead the way!

00:07:00.679 --> 00:07:03.281
Stay on my heels, and do your
best to keep up the pace.

00:07:03.281 --> 00:07:06.151
Let's get to those Chaos
Emeralds before it's too late.

00:07:06.151 --> 00:07:07.819
Remember, if we fail,

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:09.821
an entire planet will perish!

00:07:09.821 --> 00:07:11.890
And so will we.

I hope they make it in time!

I wish there was something we could
do to help Sonic and the others.

00:07:59.838 --> 00:08:02.640
Sonic will get them to the
Chaos Emeralds in time.

Hm.

Master Chris.

00:08:33.174 --> 00:08:34.476
Please, Shadow.

00:08:34.476 --> 00:08:36.544
You can help save us all.

00:08:39.781 --> 00:08:43.218
You believe that your whole reason
for being here is to get revenge.

00:08:43.218 --> 00:08:45.420
But think about it.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.322
When I was in danger back on Prison Island,

00:08:47.322 --> 00:08:48.923
you decided to save me.

00:08:51.426 --> 00:08:54.095
Deep down, you know you
were made to help others,

00:08:54.095 --> 00:08:56.631
and that's the reason you finally rescued me.

00:08:56.631 --> 00:08:58.099
Hands off!

00:08:59.334 --> 00:09:01.035
No! Chris!

00:09:01.035 --> 00:09:02.971
He needs help!

00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:07.909
It's useless.

00:09:07.909 --> 00:09:10.411
I made a promise to Maria and I'm keeping it.

00:09:11.045 --> 00:09:14.782
Shadow. Getting revenge
won't bring Maria back.

00:09:14.782 --> 00:09:16.784
So what?

00:09:16.784 --> 00:09:19.487
There's still time to stop this, Shadow.

00:09:19.487 --> 00:09:21.422
Please! You have to listen to me!

00:09:21.422 --> 00:09:23.725
How can you blame people alive today

00:09:23.725 --> 00:09:25.894
for things that happened 50 years ago?

00:09:25.894 --> 00:09:27.529
Can't you see it's not fair?

00:09:27.529 --> 00:09:30.164
Don't talk to me about fair!

00:09:30.164 --> 00:09:32.367
Not after what happened here!

00:09:36.037 --> 00:09:38.973
Maria was my only friend.

00:09:38.973 --> 00:09:43.211
But your ruler sent soldiers
to take her away from me.

00:09:43.211 --> 00:09:47.715
I tried to save her, but there
were too many for me to stop.

00:09:49.384 --> 00:09:52.620
I never saw poor Maria again.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.856
Maria wasn't a threat to anyone.

00:09:54.856 --> 00:09:57.759
All she wanted was to visit your planet,

00:09:57.759 --> 00:09:59.694
but she never had the chance.

00:10:00.295 --> 00:10:01.629
Please, listen.

00:10:03.331 --> 00:10:06.434
It's true that there are some
bad people in the world.

00:10:06.434 --> 00:10:08.469
But most people are good!

00:10:08.469 --> 00:10:11.639
I know that you'd agree with me
if you only got to know them.

00:10:11.639 --> 00:10:13.274
Just like Maria wanted to.

00:10:13.775 --> 00:10:16.044
[Struggling]

00:10:16.044 --> 00:10:18.112
Shadow, please!

00:10:18.112 --> 00:10:19.480
[Struggling]

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.383
Maria would want you to
be friends with people.

00:10:22.383 --> 00:10:25.086
[Struggling]

00:10:26.588 --> 00:10:29.057
Shadow, please promise me...

00:10:29.691 --> 00:10:30.992
That you'll... help...

00:10:30.992 --> 00:10:32.927
people...

00:10:32.927 --> 00:10:35.830
And be... friends with them...

00:10:37.865 --> 00:10:38.900
Maria!

00:10:39.834 --> 00:10:43.705
I'm sure you'll be very
happy down there, Shadow.

00:10:44.472 --> 00:10:47.575
I only wish that I could go along with you.

00:10:50.211 --> 00:10:54.349
The world looks so beautiful
from up here in space.

00:10:55.049 --> 00:10:56.851
But my grandfather says

00:10:56.851 --> 00:11:00.922
the people who live there
have to face many problems.

00:11:01.522 --> 00:11:04.258
That's why you were created.

00:11:04.258 --> 00:11:06.160
To help those people.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.396
And to be their friend.

00:11:09.063 --> 00:11:15.036
[Struggling in pain]

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:31.052
He was right about Maria.

00:11:31.052 --> 00:11:34.155
She did want me to help
the people of your world.

00:11:38.192 --> 00:11:40.128
[Beeping]

00:11:40.128 --> 00:11:41.162
Oof!

00:11:41.162 --> 00:11:42.196
Woah!

00:11:50.672 --> 00:11:52.140
Up there!

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.641
Woah!

00:11:56.644 --> 00:11:58.413
[Roaring]

00:11:58.413 --> 00:11:59.380
Woaaah!

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.615
Calm down.

00:12:00.615 --> 00:12:04.352
I'm not going to let that monster
get ahold of the Master Emerald.

00:12:05.753 --> 00:12:07.922
Leave that thing for me.

00:12:07.922 --> 00:12:09.424
Shadow!

00:12:09.424 --> 00:12:12.326
You and the others, take
care of the Chaos Emeralds,

00:12:12.326 --> 00:12:13.928
and I'll distract it.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:22.937
Hm!

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.008
Let's go!

00:12:27.008 --> 00:12:28.209
[Panting]

00:12:28.209 --> 00:12:31.012
[Sounds of fighting]

00:12:31.979 --> 00:12:33.381
Woah! Woah!

00:12:36.584 --> 00:12:37.785
[Grunting]

00:12:37.785 --> 00:12:41.055
[Sounds of fighting and grunting]

00:12:44.492 --> 00:12:46.427
Ughhhh...

00:12:50.264 --> 00:12:52.033
I must remember,

00:12:52.033 --> 00:12:55.236
the seven Chaos Emeralds are the servers.

00:12:55.236 --> 00:12:57.505
Our hearts intensify their power!

00:12:57.505 --> 00:13:00.208
The Controller serves to unify the Chaos.

00:13:00.208 --> 00:13:02.210
You can do it, Knuckles!

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:03.845
[Deep breath]

00:13:03.845 --> 00:13:06.080
Master Emerald, I need you to help me.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.949
Please, stop the Chaos Emeralds.

00:13:10.952 --> 00:13:13.855
[Roaring]

[Angry roaring]

00:13:37.678 --> 00:13:39.147
All right!

00:13:39.147 --> 00:13:39.981
Good work!

00:13:39.981 --> 00:13:40.882
[Roaring continues]

00:13:40.882 --> 00:13:42.650
Huh?

00:13:46.721 --> 00:13:48.256
It's gone!

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:51.159
Chaos Control!

00:13:51.159 --> 00:13:52.860
[Grunt]

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:53.995
What is happening?

00:13:53.995 --> 00:13:55.963
We are still heading toward the planet!

00:13:55.963 --> 00:13:56.931
Come in, Sonic.

00:13:56.931 --> 00:13:57.899
Do you read me?

00:13:57.899 --> 00:13:59.834
That monster is still alive!

00:13:59.834 --> 00:14:02.770
It attached itself to the
outside of the space colony.

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:05.006
It's pulling us toward the planet!

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.175
Hm.

00:14:07.642 --> 00:14:08.676
Hm.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:10.611
Hm.

00:14:12.547 --> 00:14:14.182
Hm.

00:14:25.893 --> 00:14:27.228
Oh?

00:14:31.265 --> 00:14:32.099
[Grunting]

00:14:33.868 --> 00:14:34.468
Huh?

00:14:34.468 --> 00:14:35.703
Sonic!

00:14:40.575 --> 00:14:41.542
[Sigh]

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:50.685
[Explosions]

00:14:50.685 --> 00:14:52.520
Let's give it our best shot!

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.287
All right!

00:14:53.287 --> 00:14:55.857
We can go in at full speed and finish it off!

00:14:59.794 --> 00:15:02.930
The space colony is still rushing
towards us, Mr. President.

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:04.532
We're only minutes away from impact.

00:15:05.533 --> 00:15:06.434
[Groan]

00:15:07.535 --> 00:15:08.636
Hey, what's that?

00:15:15.376 --> 00:15:19.247
Soon the space colony won't be able
to escape the planet's gravity!

00:15:19.247 --> 00:15:21.682
It'll be impossible to stop it from crashing!

00:15:21.682 --> 00:15:22.783
Come on, Sonic.

00:15:22.783 --> 00:15:24.085
You can stop it!

00:15:24.085 --> 00:15:28.122
Let's hope. But I'm afraid no one
can save us from disaster now.

00:15:29.857 --> 00:15:32.526
You have to defeat that monster, Sonic.

00:15:32.526 --> 00:15:34.128
We're all depending on you.

00:15:35.096 --> 00:15:36.464
Sonic...

00:15:36.464 --> 00:15:37.999
Shadow...

00:15:38.633 --> 00:15:40.568
Topaz! You read me?

00:15:40.568 --> 00:15:41.903
Yes, Rouge.

00:15:41.903 --> 00:15:43.204
What's going on there?

00:15:43.204 --> 00:15:45.439
I don't understand what Sonic's up to.

00:15:45.439 --> 00:15:48.643
That large red object is
actually Space Colony ARK,

00:15:48.643 --> 00:15:50.945
glowing, as it re-enters the atmosphere.

00:15:50.945 --> 00:15:53.948
For 50 years, it's existence
was kept a secret.

00:15:53.948 --> 00:15:55.950
In the course of our investigation,

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:59.220
we uncovered a conspiracy within
our intelligence services

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:02.189
that now threatens the
survival of this planet.

00:16:02.189 --> 00:16:03.824
Our only hope lies in the bravery

00:16:03.824 --> 00:16:07.695
of two hedgehogs who are
now fighting for all of us.

00:16:07.695 --> 00:16:09.230
Please, Sonic!

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:10.731
Chao chao!

00:16:10.731 --> 00:16:14.468
Sonic! Go...!!!!!

You can do it, Sonic!

00:16:46.203 --> 00:16:48.539
Give it all you've got, Shadow!

00:16:50.141 --> 00:16:53.044
If you fail, the entire
planet will be destroyed!

00:16:53.044 --> 00:16:55.146
Tough it out, you guys!

00:16:55.146 --> 00:16:56.814
You can do it!

00:16:56.814 --> 00:16:58.783
We know you can!

00:16:58.783 --> 00:17:00.184
Sonic!

Maria...

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:44.829
I did it...

00:17:44.829 --> 00:17:46.163
For you...

00:17:52.603 --> 00:17:53.838
[Crowd cheering]

00:17:53.838 --> 00:17:55.439
Yay! All right!

00:17:55.439 --> 00:17:56.640
That's great!

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.875
It's over!

00:17:58.576 --> 00:18:00.511
So happy!

00:18:00.511 --> 00:18:01.612
Yeah!

00:18:01.612 --> 00:18:02.580
Whoo!

00:18:04.615 --> 00:18:07.051
The space agency just reported in.

00:18:07.051 --> 00:18:10.554
They said that the space colony has
moved back into a stable orbit.

00:18:11.355 --> 00:18:12.857
Thank goodness.

00:18:13.624 --> 00:18:17.728
Sonic could be charged with violating
space agency regulations.

00:18:17.728 --> 00:18:21.298
Ya know, after all that
Sonic's done for the planet,

00:18:21.298 --> 00:18:24.702
I don't think the voters
would like that very much.

00:18:25.503 --> 00:18:26.637
Don't you agree?

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.041
Yes, I suppose you're right.

00:18:35.079 --> 00:18:37.982
My grandfather was truly a genius.

00:18:37.982 --> 00:18:39.283
Ever since I was a lad,

00:18:39.283 --> 00:18:41.352
he was my one true hero.

00:18:41.352 --> 00:18:44.688
I always wanted to become
a great scientist like him.

00:18:44.688 --> 00:18:47.424
But he shouldn't have tried
to destroy the planet.

00:18:47.424 --> 00:18:49.460
How could he do something so wrong?

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:54.098
I don't know, but you helped
us all to save the world!

00:18:54.098 --> 00:18:56.767
I'm so happy the planet was saved.

00:18:56.767 --> 00:18:59.470
Now I can conquer it and establish my empire!

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:00.337
Huh?

00:19:00.337 --> 00:19:03.007
You still wanna take over the world?

00:19:03.007 --> 00:19:03.941
Affirmative!

00:19:03.941 --> 00:19:06.143
You are welcome to join us if you would like.

00:19:06.143 --> 00:19:07.778
No, thank you.

00:19:20.524 --> 00:19:22.059
Where's Shadow?

00:19:35.573 --> 00:19:36.874
Ya know,

00:19:36.874 --> 00:19:41.545
maybe Professor Robotnik wanted Shadow
to stop his crazy plan all along.

00:19:41.545 --> 00:19:43.480
We'll never know.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:47.351
But in the end, Shadow sacrificed
everything to save us all.

00:19:57.261 --> 00:19:58.629
He sure did.

00:20:02.633 --> 00:20:04.134
Come on, Chris.

00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:07.605
Let's head back.

00:20:07.605 --> 00:20:11.175
Space is fine, but I like
my feet on the ground.

00:20:11.942 --> 00:20:13.110
The rocket's ready!

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.045
It's time to go!

00:20:27.191 --> 00:20:30.461
Sayonara, Shadow the Hedgehog.
