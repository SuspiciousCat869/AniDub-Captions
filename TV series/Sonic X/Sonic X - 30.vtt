00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:03.403
Last time on Sonic X, after
a high-flying battle,

00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:06.707
Tails transformed the X Tornado
into Battle Armor mode

00:00:06.707 --> 00:00:10.043
and headed straight for the Egg Carrier
with Sonic and Knuckles in tow

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:12.980
to rescue Amy from the clutches of Eggman.

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:17.184
Hang on!

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:19.953
Almost there!

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:22.956
Let's bring it in for a
nice, smooth landing, Tails.

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:25.559
Aah! Oh, no!

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:26.326
What is it?

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:28.228
You'll have to settle for nice and bumpy.

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:29.396
We don't have any wheels!

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:30.364
What?

00:00:35.903 --> 00:00:37.504
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:40.607
Gotta go fast

00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:43.577
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:49.383
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

Stuck in a new location

00:00:53.487 --> 00:00:57.090
Without any explanation

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.159
No talk of relaxation

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.794
Don't, don't, don't

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:02.596
Don't blink, don't think

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:04.398
Just go, go, go, go

00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:05.899
Go, go

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:11.405
Sonic is on the run

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:13.307
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:17.044
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:29.456
Gotta go faster,

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:32.292
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:33.327
Sonic X

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:42.002
Let's go!

00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:43.604
Right! [Laughs]

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:46.306
Later, guys!

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:47.474
Quick! Launch attack!

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:48.575

He's turning back!

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.787
Tails! You okay?

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:03.957
Uh-huh! [Laughs]

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:06.927
Come on!

Aah!

00:02:09.196 --> 00:02:10.764
I'll meet up with you later.

00:02:10.764 --> 00:02:13.767
Now's my chance to search for
the rest of that Master Emerald.

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:14.901
But, Knuckles!

00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:17.571
Don't sweat it, Tails. You
and I can look for Amy.

00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:20.040
Let's go before they launch another attack.

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.077
We missed them, Doctor.

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:24.845
Now what?

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:26.413
They won't get far.

Oh, Gamma!

Report to the control deck immediately.

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:36.790
I have a job for you.

[Panting for breath]

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:44.631
Now if we can only find a way out!

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:45.799
[Chirps in panic]

Please, calm down.

Oh, Eggman!

Hmm?

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:02.449
Don't you think you ought to
pick on somebody your own size?

00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:05.085
You did come!

Boys, keep your eyes on the birdy.

Yes, Doctor.

Nice birdy.

You called, Dr. Eggman?

What is your wish?

- It's you!
- EGGMAN: [Chuckles]

Don't shoot, robot!

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.292
It's Eggman that's making him act this way.

Woah!

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.084
Not again.

00:08:04.417 --> 00:08:06.386
This is getting ridiculous.

00:08:06.386 --> 00:08:07.454
Huh?

00:08:07.754 --> 00:08:08.588
Oh!

00:08:08.588 --> 00:08:10.390
Hey! Are you okay?

00:08:11.124 --> 00:08:13.593
I-I did my best to stop them.

00:08:13.593 --> 00:08:16.496
But Father and the others
would not listen to me.

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:19.399
I don't... know what to do.

00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:23.003
[Cries]

00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:25.171
Wh-what's that? [Gasps]
[Cries]

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:27.674
Huh?

00:08:28.274 --> 00:08:29.542
Woah...

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:32.312
Who are you?

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:36.383
Hey! Come back!

00:08:37.817 --> 00:08:39.185
Augh!

00:08:41.087 --> 00:08:42.355
What's happening?

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:45.291
There must be some reason why
I'm being shown these things.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.963
Calm down, Big! Relax!

00:08:49.963 --> 00:08:51.331
Try not to panic!

00:08:51.331 --> 00:08:55.168
[Gulping]

00:08:56.403 --> 00:08:57.637
Feeling better now?

00:08:57.637 --> 00:08:59.039
I think so.

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.306
Well, that's good.

00:09:01.274 --> 00:09:04.177
[Grunting]

00:09:04.177 --> 00:09:06.112
Be careful!

00:09:06.112 --> 00:09:15.588
[Grunting]

00:09:15.588 --> 00:09:19.759
I almost fell! I don't know
if I can hold on any longer!

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:23.730
I'm sorry, Big. It's just no use.
I can't reach him from here.

00:09:24.097 --> 00:09:27.400
Ooh! Don't give up!

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:32.205
Maybe it might be easier if I
hold you out a little bit more.

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:37.744
[Grunting with effort]

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:38.878
Got him!

00:09:38.878 --> 00:09:40.547
Alright! Hurry!

00:09:40.547 --> 00:09:42.482
Let's get outta here!

00:09:42.482 --> 00:09:45.385
[Grunting]

00:09:46.486 --> 00:09:47.487
Oh, no!

00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:50.023
[Evil laugh]

00:09:50.457 --> 00:09:51.758
It's Eggman!

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:55.628
[Loud cackling]

00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:57.764
Ah!

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.468
Woah!

00:10:09.468 --> 00:10:10.235
Ribbit...

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:14.206
Well, well. Tryin' to get the jump on me, eh?

00:10:14.206 --> 00:10:18.010
Chaos, this freaky froggy
has the most unusual "tail"

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:19.712
if you catch my meaning.

00:10:19.712 --> 00:10:20.512
[Menacing growl]

00:10:20.512 --> 00:10:21.447
[Scared]

00:10:23.182 --> 00:10:25.117
Quick, let's make a run for it!

00:10:25.117 --> 00:10:26.085
Yeah!

00:10:26.085 --> 00:10:32.157
[Grunts, Panting]

00:10:35.327 --> 00:10:36.528
Put him down!

00:10:37.062 --> 00:10:38.130
Ribbit...

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:41.867
[Evil laughter] [Ribbit]

00:10:42.234 --> 00:10:43.602
Ribbit...

00:10:44.303 --> 00:10:47.473
And now, the amazing Eggman
will do some magic!

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:52.111
Two Emeralds. And now, to
make them both disappear!

00:10:52.544 --> 00:10:53.512
[Grunts]

00:10:53.746 --> 00:10:54.513
[Grunt]

00:10:58.417 --> 00:11:01.854
[Yelling in pain]

00:11:06.225 --> 00:11:07.926
Aah!

00:11:09.128 --> 00:11:12.331
Now I know you had a big lunch today, Chaos,

00:11:12.331 --> 00:11:15.234
but I hope you saved room
for some yummy dessert!

00:11:15.234 --> 00:11:16.101
Enjoy!

00:11:16.101 --> 00:11:17.069
No!

00:11:17.069 --> 00:11:19.638
Hang on, Froggy! I'll save you!

00:11:19.638 --> 00:11:21.106
Stand back, Big!

00:11:21.874 --> 00:11:23.542
[Battle Cry]

00:11:23.542 --> 00:11:24.610
[Dazed]

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:26.412
That'll work.

00:11:26.412 --> 00:11:28.747
[Grunting]

00:11:28.747 --> 00:11:30.916
I got you, Froggy!

00:11:30.916 --> 00:11:32.684
Well, Chaos?

00:11:33.285 --> 00:11:34.420
Aah!

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:35.454
Gotcha!

00:11:35.454 --> 00:11:39.525
[Squirming]

00:11:46.031 --> 00:11:47.533
Heh, heh!

00:11:47.533 --> 00:11:48.600
Huh?

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.202
It's Sonic!

00:11:50.202 --> 00:11:52.538
Holy cow! That's Chris in there!

00:11:52.538 --> 00:11:53.505
Hang on!

00:11:56.442 --> 00:11:57.376
Woah!

00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:59.011
Woah!

00:11:59.311 --> 00:12:01.246
I'm comin', Chris! Aah..!

00:12:02.281 --> 00:12:05.217
[Grunts]

00:12:06.251 --> 00:12:07.486
Woah!

00:12:07.486 --> 00:12:11.890
[Both yelling]

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:12.991
Whew!

00:12:13.559 --> 00:12:16.762
Now, Chaos, let's whip
that hedgehog into shape!

00:12:20.332 --> 00:12:21.467
Woah!

00:12:21.467 --> 00:12:22.534
Oof!

00:12:26.038 --> 00:12:27.639
[Evil laughter]

00:12:27.639 --> 00:12:30.008
Tenderize it with your tendrils, Chaos!

00:12:30.008 --> 00:12:31.910
Muffled

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:33.312
Sonic!

00:12:33.312 --> 00:12:35.814
Hold on, Chris! I'll get you out!

00:12:35.814 --> 00:12:37.182
Just hang tight!

00:12:37.182 --> 00:12:38.116
Huh?

00:12:38.517 --> 00:12:39.485
What the-?

00:12:39.485 --> 00:12:41.086
Hey! Knuckles!

00:12:41.086 --> 00:12:42.588
[Grunts]

00:12:42.588 --> 00:12:44.823
Don't worry! We'll get them outta here!

00:12:44.823 --> 00:12:45.858
Yeah? How?

00:12:45.858 --> 00:12:48.460
I'll give you a hint! [Laughs]

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.829
Oh. Shovel Claw, huh?

00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:52.331
You gotta problem with that?

00:12:52.331 --> 00:12:54.266
Nope. No problem here.

00:12:54.266 --> 00:12:55.801
But if you get too close to that thing,

00:12:55.801 --> 00:12:58.303
it might suck that claw right in.

00:12:59.204 --> 00:13:02.107
We gotta figure out some way to get through!

00:13:02.107 --> 00:13:04.076
There must be a weak spot hidden somewhere

00:13:04.076 --> 00:13:05.878
in that overgrown jellyfish.

00:13:05.878 --> 00:13:07.546
Hey, hold the phone there, buddy.

00:13:07.546 --> 00:13:08.847
Do you see what I see?

00:13:09.815 --> 00:13:10.816
That's it!

00:13:11.216 --> 00:13:12.918
Heh.

00:13:15.387 --> 00:13:16.388
Ready, Knuckles?

00:13:16.388 --> 00:13:17.289
Ready!

00:13:17.289 --> 00:13:18.423
Let's go!

00:13:19.825 --> 00:13:20.792
Ha!

00:13:20.792 --> 00:13:23.695
Now, Shovel Claw!

00:13:23.695 --> 00:13:24.630
Go for it!

00:13:31.203 --> 00:13:32.204
[Yelling]

00:13:34.139 --> 00:13:35.641
Hey, Froggy?

00:13:35.908 --> 00:13:38.810
There should be one more Emerald around here.

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:40.412
[Groans]

00:13:41.647 --> 00:13:43.682
Hey, Chris, you doin' okay?

00:13:43.682 --> 00:13:45.417
Mm-hmm.

00:13:45.417 --> 00:13:49.454
Only problem is, how do
we get off of this thing?

00:13:50.022 --> 00:13:53.425
We'll use the X Tornado. Easy!

00:13:53.425 --> 00:13:55.961
[Grunts]

00:13:56.328 --> 00:13:57.496
Doctor, wait!

00:13:57.496 --> 00:13:58.931
You can't leave us here!

00:13:58.931 --> 00:14:00.666
Where do you think you're going?

00:14:00.666 --> 00:14:01.833
None of your business!

00:14:01.833 --> 00:14:03.268
Watch out, Doctor!

00:14:03.268 --> 00:14:03.936
Back at ya!

00:14:03.936 --> 00:14:06.171
Let go of me, you hideous hedge rat!

00:14:06.171 --> 00:14:07.139
Sonic!

00:14:07.139 --> 00:14:08.106
Don't worry.

00:14:08.106 --> 00:14:10.042
He can take care of himself.

00:14:10.776 --> 00:14:12.711
Sure is neat, huh, Froggy?

00:14:12.711 --> 00:14:13.912
What's he doing?

00:14:13.912 --> 00:14:15.614
Don't touch anything, Big!

00:14:15.614 --> 00:14:17.950
What if he tries to fly that thing?

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.618
Big, wait for us!

00:14:19.618 --> 00:14:23.288
Uh oh! I gotta feeling we're
in big trouble, Froggy!

00:14:23.288 --> 00:14:24.323
Stay where you are!

00:14:24.323 --> 00:14:26.058
Too late!

00:14:27.225 --> 00:14:28.327
No!

00:14:28.327 --> 00:14:30.662
Big, come back!

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:33.031
Where is everyone?

00:14:33.031 --> 00:14:34.232
Search me!

00:14:34.232 --> 00:14:35.500
Oh well.

00:14:36.068 --> 00:14:37.269
Ack!

00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:39.371
No use hanging around here.

00:14:39.371 --> 00:14:40.772
You can say that again!

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.775
I hope Sonic's okay.

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:46.712
I wish we didn't have to leave him behind.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.414
[Chirp]

00:14:49.414 --> 00:14:51.650
I know you're sad too, Lily.

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:54.886
That mean old Eggman took your
Chaos Emerald away, didn't he?

00:14:56.455 --> 00:14:57.889
Is that-?

00:14:57.889 --> 00:14:59.224
Your brother and sister?

00:14:59.224 --> 00:15:00.425
[Chirp]

00:15:00.959 --> 00:15:02.894
Did Eggman catch them too?

00:15:02.894 --> 00:15:03.829
[Chirp]

00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:05.130
And when you were rescued,

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.332
you had to leave them behind, didn't you?

00:15:07.332 --> 00:15:08.667
[Chirp]

00:15:08.667 --> 00:15:09.635
That's so sad.

00:15:09.635 --> 00:15:11.370
[Sad chirping]

00:15:12.704 --> 00:15:14.973
Lily! Follow me!

00:15:14.973 --> 00:15:16.108
[Chirping]

00:15:16.108 --> 00:15:18.210
We're gonna find your brother and sister!

00:15:19.511 --> 00:15:20.545
Woah...

00:15:21.613 --> 00:15:23.915
[Dizzy recovery]

00:15:23.915 --> 00:15:32.524
[Struggles]

00:15:32.524 --> 00:15:34.459
Talk about a headache!

00:15:34.459 --> 00:15:37.329
Boy, that's the last time
I hitch a ride with Eggman.

00:15:37.329 --> 00:15:38.697
[Confused]

00:15:40.999 --> 00:15:42.601
Who would've thought?

00:15:42.601 --> 00:15:45.504
Just a couple of weeks ago, I
was an advisor to the president!

00:15:45.504 --> 00:15:47.239
And now look at me.

00:15:47.239 --> 00:15:50.175
Picking through slimy
dumpsters for my next meal.

00:15:50.175 --> 00:15:52.244
How low can I go? Huh?

00:15:52.244 --> 00:15:53.712
Eggman!

00:15:53.712 --> 00:15:54.613
Who are you?

00:15:54.613 --> 00:15:56.114
You might not remember me, sir.

00:15:56.114 --> 00:15:57.783
I was an advisor to the president.

00:15:57.783 --> 00:15:59.017
Oh, is that so?

00:15:59.017 --> 00:16:01.953
And what are you doing these
days? Besides not bathing.

00:16:01.953 --> 00:16:03.889
To tell you the truth, not much of anything.

00:16:03.889 --> 00:16:05.824
If you could help me out, I'd appreciate it.

00:16:05.824 --> 00:16:09.961
I have just the thing you need to put
a spark in that humdrum life of yours.

00:16:09.961 --> 00:16:11.596
I'll take it! I'll take it!

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:13.298
Here. Try this.

00:16:13.298 --> 00:16:15.467
Thank you. Thank you, sir!

00:16:15.467 --> 00:16:16.968
Thank you!

00:16:18.003 --> 00:16:20.005
The pleasure's mine.

00:16:22.007 --> 00:16:25.544
Aah!

00:16:28.747 --> 00:16:30.115
Some kind of missile!

00:16:30.115 --> 00:16:31.116
Action!

00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:34.019
This is Scarlet Garcia,
live from Station Square,

00:16:34.019 --> 00:16:36.855
where an unidentified missile
has been discovered.

00:16:36.855 --> 00:16:38.824
It's sure been nice knowing you all!

00:16:38.824 --> 00:16:39.825
Bye bye!

00:16:39.825 --> 00:16:42.360
[Yelling]

00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:46.131
So long, Station Square!

00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:49.601
[Evil laugh]

00:16:56.675 --> 00:16:58.143
What was that thing?

00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:00.812
Oh no!

00:17:00.812 --> 00:17:02.114
It's going to crash!

00:17:02.114 --> 00:17:04.049
[Crowd screaming]

00:17:11.476 --> 00:17:13.144
[Woman crying]

00:17:13.144 --> 00:17:15.346
It came outta nowhere!

00:17:15.346 --> 00:17:17.281
That bridge could go at any minute!

00:17:19.384 --> 00:17:21.552
It looks like no one was hurt.

00:17:21.552 --> 00:17:24.255
Now, listen up! I got a message,

00:17:24.255 --> 00:17:27.558
and it's from Eggman, so you
folks better listen good.

00:17:28.192 --> 00:17:29.894
Well, well.

00:17:29.894 --> 00:17:32.230
I hope you all enjoyed my surprise.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:34.132
I had a <i>blast</i> putting it together.

00:17:34.132 --> 00:17:38.069
And you'll have a blast in about two
minutes when my missile goes off.

00:17:38.069 --> 00:17:39.771
[Crowd screams]

00:17:39.771 --> 00:17:43.274
And now my trusty assistant Bokkun
will begin the final countdown!

00:17:43.274 --> 00:17:43.908
Bokkun?

00:17:43.908 --> 00:17:45.843
Uh, countdown?

00:17:45.843 --> 00:17:47.445
Start counting.

00:17:47.445 --> 00:17:48.513
Okay.

00:17:48.513 --> 00:17:49.547
120.

00:17:49.547 --> 00:17:50.581
119.

00:17:50.581 --> 00:17:54.419
If Sonic were here, he'd know what to do.

00:17:54.419 --> 00:17:56.354
Hey, no sweat, pal.

00:17:56.354 --> 00:17:57.321
114.

00:17:57.321 --> 00:17:58.923
113.

00:17:58.923 --> 00:18:00.358
112.

00:18:00.358 --> 00:18:01.826
111.

00:18:04.762 --> 00:18:06.731
What are y'all lookin' at me for?

00:18:06.731 --> 00:18:09.167
There's nothing I can do about this.

00:18:09.934 --> 00:18:11.135
I wish...

00:18:11.335 --> 00:18:13.304
He'd say I should try.

00:18:13.304 --> 00:18:15.239
[Grunts]

00:18:15.239 --> 00:18:18.142
He'd say I could do anything I tried.

00:18:18.142 --> 00:18:21.379
Alright, I'll give it my best shot!

00:18:21.379 --> 00:18:22.847
Here goes!

00:18:25.917 --> 00:18:29.220
It looks as though Tails is
attempting to defuse the bomb.

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:29.987
90

00:18:29.987 --> 00:18:33.925
If only I could figure out
which is the right wire.

00:18:33.925 --> 00:18:36.828
If I cut the wrong one,
this thing will detonate.

00:18:36.828 --> 00:18:39.497
But I-I don't have much time!

00:18:39.497 --> 00:18:41.466
82

00:18:41.466 --> 00:18:42.433
81

00:18:43.067 --> 00:18:44.368
Sonic!

00:18:44.368 --> 00:18:45.903
79

00:18:47.738 --> 00:18:50.208
Sonic's always been there for me.

00:18:50.208 --> 00:18:52.276
He's taught me so much.

00:18:52.276 --> 00:18:55.880
But maybe now it's time I learned
to stand on my own two feet.

00:18:56.647 --> 00:18:58.783
I know a lot of technical stuff.

00:18:58.783 --> 00:19:01.819
I should be able to disarm
this thing in no time!

00:19:01.819 --> 00:19:02.720
38

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.388
Now let's see.

00:19:04.388 --> 00:19:06.324
It can't be that one.

00:19:06.324 --> 00:19:07.258
35

00:19:07.258 --> 00:19:08.125
Hmm.

00:19:08.125 --> 00:19:09.460
34

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.695
I got it!

00:19:10.695 --> 00:19:12.630
32 3- Huh?

00:19:14.799 --> 00:19:16.434
I did it!

00:19:16.434 --> 00:19:19.937
[Cheering]

00:19:19.937 --> 00:19:21.038
Alright!

00:19:21.038 --> 00:19:22.006
Thank you!

00:19:23.574 --> 00:19:24.509
We love you, Tails!

00:19:24.509 --> 00:19:25.877
You saved us!

00:19:25.877 --> 00:19:28.012
Thanks, everyone! [Laughs]

00:19:28.012 --> 00:19:29.046
Huh?

00:19:29.614 --> 00:19:30.982
What is it?

00:19:30.982 --> 00:19:32.884
[Beeping]

00:19:32.884 --> 00:19:33.484
Thanks!

00:19:33.484 --> 00:19:37.722
Well, you just wait 'til
I tell Dr. Eggman. Ha!

00:19:41.759 --> 00:19:43.861
I really did it, didn't I?

00:19:53.104 --> 00:19:56.574
[Groaning]

00:19:57.141 --> 00:19:58.509
Everybody okay?

00:20:00.444 --> 00:20:02.380
Were ya going, Knuckles?

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:05.716
I've gotta find a way back to Angel Island.

00:20:05.716 --> 00:20:06.951
Good luck, Chris.

00:20:06.951 --> 00:20:08.586
Hey, where are we?

00:20:08.586 --> 00:20:10.555
In Mystic Ruin, I think.

00:20:12.123 --> 00:20:13.157
[Crash]

00:20:13.157 --> 00:20:14.525
Woah, that was close!

00:20:14.525 --> 00:20:16.160
It almost crushed us!

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.063
[Nervous Laugh] I guess we're just... lucky.

00:20:19.063 --> 00:20:20.498
Lucky?

00:20:20.498 --> 00:20:20.998
Ribbit!

00:20:20.998 --> 00:20:22.166
Hey, look!

00:20:27.271 --> 00:20:30.374
[Grunt] A Chaos Emerald!

00:20:31.442 --> 00:20:33.377
I think it's the seventh one!

00:20:33.878 --> 00:20:36.881
Hey! Knuckles!

00:20:40.418 --> 00:20:41.953
See ya, buddy.

00:20:41.953 --> 00:20:43.321
Ribbit!

00:20:44.255 --> 00:20:46.324
I'm sleepy.

00:20:46.324 --> 00:20:49.694
Whaddaya say you and me go home, Froggy?

00:20:49.694 --> 00:20:50.361
Ribbit!
