Attention! I have an important
announcement that I'm sure you'll hate.

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:15.449
[Evil laugh]

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.384
Your favorite fiend has returned!

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:20.487
Your King of Calamity,
the awesome Dr. Eggman!

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:25.158
I am delighted to inform you that this
planet will soon be under my power!

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:28.028
It is pointless to
try and resist me!

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:32.866
Surrender immediately, or
you'll all be destroyed.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.002
[Animals screaming,

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:37.170
If Sonic was back in this world,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.872
we would have seen him by now.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.207
We're wasting our time.

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:42.743
He must've decided he liked
that other planet better.

00:00:42.743 --> 00:00:45.045
I'm positive Sonic
followed me here.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:47.581
He would never let his
archenemy get away.

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:49.516
I'm not sure, Doctor.

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:51.985
Perhaps Sonic got bored
fighting with you.

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:53.754
Working with him is even worse.

00:00:53.754 --> 00:00:55.689
Let's just get this over with!

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:57.824
[Frustrated yell] Now here this!

00:00:57.824 --> 00:00:59.760
This is your last warning!

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.663
Submit to my rule, or I'll
wipe out this whole world!

00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:04.131
You hear that, Sonic?

00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:05.432
Sonic!!!

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.334
Go, go, go, go, go

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:10.437

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.373
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:15.676 --> 00:01:19.212
Movin' at the speed of sound,

Stuck in a new location

Without any explanation

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.989
No talk of relaxation

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:30.624
Don't, don't, don't

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:32.426
Don't blink, don't think

00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:34.227
Just go, go, go, go

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:35.729
Go, go

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.234
Sonic is on the run

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:43.136
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:46.873
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

[Sipping]

00:02:11.662 --> 00:02:14.198
Ahh! Just the way I like it!

00:02:14.198 --> 00:02:16.900
We're really happy you
stopped by to visit us, Amy.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.769
Chao chao!

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.640
So, have you thought about that
offer we made the other day?

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.009
Would you like to come live here?

00:02:25.976 --> 00:02:27.911
Thanks for the invitation,

00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:29.780
but I... can't accept.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.748
Why?

00:02:30.748 --> 00:02:32.716
We want you to stay here with us!

00:02:32.716 --> 00:02:34.618
We really care about you!

00:02:34.618 --> 00:02:35.853
Please, Cream.

00:02:35.853 --> 00:02:37.488
I know!

00:02:38.455 --> 00:02:40.991
I'm really glad I have
a friend like you.

00:02:40.991 --> 00:02:42.893
But you don't have
to worry about me.

00:02:42.893 --> 00:02:45.129
It's been lonely
without Sonic around,

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.133
but... I know... he'll come back.

00:02:49.133 --> 00:02:52.102
DR. EGGMAN: I am back,
and better than ever!

00:02:52.102 --> 00:02:54.938
I've come to publicize
my dastardly designs

00:02:54.938 --> 00:02:57.007
for building the Eggman Empire!

00:02:57.007 --> 00:03:00.778
I'm all set to spread misery
and mayhem around the globe!

00:03:00.778 --> 00:03:04.648
You'd better quit your foot-dragging
and race to the rescue, Sonic.

00:03:04.648 --> 00:03:07.518
Otherwise, this world will
have to face the music!

00:03:07.518 --> 00:03:08.686
[Disco music starts playing] Yeah!

00:03:08.686 --> 00:03:09.953
How embarrassing.

00:03:09.953 --> 00:03:11.388
What dance is that?

00:03:11.388 --> 00:03:13.457
I think it is called "The Jerk."

00:03:13.457 --> 00:03:14.625
[All yelp]

00:03:14.625 --> 00:03:16.293
What was that?

00:03:16.293 --> 00:03:18.062
I think something hit us!

00:03:20.731 --> 00:03:23.734
Hey, who is the wise guy
that hammered our hull?

00:03:23.734 --> 00:03:27.004
There's something about that hammer
that looks awfully familiar.

00:03:27.004 --> 00:03:29.239
Amy, why did you hit us?

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.041
We were not bothering you!

00:03:31.041 --> 00:03:33.243
Don't you have any
idea what time it is?

00:03:33.243 --> 00:03:34.111
Turn down the volume,

00:03:34.111 --> 00:03:36.780
or I'll knock that flying
loudspeaker out of the sky!

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.248
Grr!

00:03:38.248 --> 00:03:40.417
Just because your
boyfriend's not here,

00:03:40.417 --> 00:03:41.952
don't take it out on me!

00:03:41.952 --> 00:03:43.120
That is right!

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.089
You should not blame Dr. Eggman!

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:47.891
It certainly isn't my fault
he hasn't shown up yet.

00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:50.527
I bet the reason Sonic stayed
back on that other planet

00:03:50.527 --> 00:03:52.730
was 'cause he couldn't stand
to be with you anymore!

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.298
GRRR!

00:03:54.865 --> 00:03:57.601
Aaaaaah!

00:03:57.601 --> 00:04:00.237
Amy's a hothead, but
now she's hot all over!

00:04:00.237 --> 00:04:02.172
Talk about fired up!

00:04:02.172 --> 00:04:03.607
She'll cook our goose.

00:04:03.607 --> 00:04:06.043
Perhaps we should say we are sorry.

00:04:06.043 --> 00:04:08.746
She's the one who's gonna be
sorry if she messes with me!

00:04:08.746 --> 00:04:11.014
[Chuckles] You'd better
cool off, cupcake!

00:04:11.014 --> 00:04:14.351
We've got your hammer up
here, so you can't touch us!

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:16.987
Aah! Another one!

00:04:16.987 --> 00:04:19.790
She has more hammers
than a hardware store!

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.659
Don't strike me just because
you struck out with Sonic!

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:24.661
[Screaming]

00:04:24.661 --> 00:04:25.629
You creep!

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:26.930
Where's your boyfriend?

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.999
Don't tease her! She's
mad enough already!

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:30.901
That's because Sonic dumped her!

00:04:30.901 --> 00:04:32.803
I was not dumped!

00:04:32.803 --> 00:04:36.240
Oh, yeah? Then how come Sonic's
hiding from you on another planet?

00:04:37.875 --> 00:04:39.777
Amy's not too happy.

00:04:39.777 --> 00:04:42.045
She's been like that
since came back.

00:04:42.045 --> 00:04:43.981
I know why.

00:04:43.981 --> 00:04:46.917
She misses having Sonic
around to hang out with.

00:04:47.885 --> 00:04:51.755
Yeah, this planet can
get pretty lonely.

00:04:51.755 --> 00:04:54.658
I wonder why Sonic still
hasn't shown up yet?

00:04:54.658 --> 00:04:56.593
What do you think?

00:04:57.928 --> 00:05:01.198
Who knows? Sonic's unpredictable.

00:05:01.198 --> 00:05:03.100
I'm sure he's on his way...

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.970
Unless he hit a time warp during
the transfer to this world.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.172
If that happened...

00:05:08.172 --> 00:05:11.074
He may not get here
for weeks, or months.

00:05:11.074 --> 00:05:12.042
Even years.

00:05:12.042 --> 00:05:14.411
Time warps are trickier
than you realize.

00:05:14.411 --> 00:05:17.314
All kinds of crazy things can
happen if you get stuck in one.

00:05:17.314 --> 00:05:20.217
Of course, you're just a jewel
thief, so you wouldn't know.

00:05:20.217 --> 00:05:21.652
You don't have a clue.

00:05:21.652 --> 00:05:23.120
[Thud] Ow!

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.055
Aah! What'd you do that for?

00:05:25.055 --> 00:05:27.524
Hmph. 'Cause I don't
like your attitude!

00:05:27.524 --> 00:05:30.160
[Mocking] "You're just a jewel
thief, so you wouldn't know."

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.596
Ugh! Instead of being
so nasty all the time,

00:05:32.596 --> 00:05:34.832
maybe you could try being
nice to me once in a while!

00:05:34.832 --> 00:05:37.401
And then maybe I wouldn't
find you so unlikable!

00:05:37.401 --> 00:05:39.837
As it is now, you're as sour
as a truckload of lemons!

00:05:39.837 --> 00:05:41.271
Then don't hang out with me!

00:05:41.271 --> 00:05:42.973
I won't!

00:05:42.973 --> 00:05:46.076
Once I'm gone, you'll be
completely miserable, mister!

00:05:46.076 --> 00:05:48.078
Actually, it'll be a huge
relief not to have to

00:05:48.078 --> 00:05:50.481
deal with your batty behavior.

00:05:50.481 --> 00:05:52.416
But I'm sure you'll
come flying back.

00:05:52.416 --> 00:05:53.650
Aah!

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.685
Ah!

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:56.620
Oof.

00:05:58.155 --> 00:06:00.491
Grr. That does it!

00:06:01.458 --> 00:06:03.227
It's been a real kick
having you around,

00:06:03.227 --> 00:06:04.895
but you'd better behave yourself,

00:06:04.895 --> 00:06:07.364
or I'll have to give you the boot!

00:06:07.364 --> 00:06:11.168
I'm gonna keep pounding away
'til I've got you tenderized!

00:06:11.168 --> 00:06:13.904
From now on, you're
gonna respect me!

00:06:13.904 --> 00:06:16.807
ROUGE: It's time you learned some manners!
KNUCKLES: Ow! Ooof! Aah!

00:06:17.774 --> 00:06:20.410
ROUGE: You'd better start being polite or else!
KNUCKLES: Ow! Oww!

00:06:21.378 --> 00:06:24.414
I'm grouchy when I
don't get my sleep.

00:06:24.414 --> 00:06:26.917
I'll teach you not to
wake me up, Eggman!

00:06:26.917 --> 00:06:29.319
I won't rest until
I track down Sonic,

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:30.821
and nobody else will, either.

00:06:30.821 --> 00:06:32.389
So if you want to
get back to sleep,

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:34.691
then help me find that hedgehog!

00:06:34.691 --> 00:06:36.760
I'm never helping you!

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.128
He is challenging us.

00:06:38.128 --> 00:06:40.264
Shall we charge up
the cannons, Doctor?

00:06:40.264 --> 00:06:42.232
We can blast him out of the sky.

00:06:42.232 --> 00:06:43.500
Good idea.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.468
Aah!

00:06:45.168 --> 00:06:46.436
DR. EGGMAN: Hold on!

00:06:46.436 --> 00:06:48.672
We're not ready to fight you yet!

00:06:48.672 --> 00:06:50.841
Let's lead him into a trap.

00:06:50.841 --> 00:06:52.109
DR. EGGMAN: Follow me, Tails!

00:06:52.109 --> 00:06:55.245
TAILS: Okay, but don't
try anything funny!

00:06:55.245 --> 00:06:56.413
Who, me?

00:06:56.413 --> 00:06:59.917
Get back here! I'm not
finished with you, Eggman!

00:06:59.917 --> 00:07:01.919
[Panting]

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:03.887
Why don't you come
back inside, Amy?

00:07:03.887 --> 00:07:05.822
Your tea's getting cold.

00:07:05.822 --> 00:07:06.957
Chao chao chao!

00:07:11.962 --> 00:07:13.964
We'll hide from him
behind these clouds.

00:07:13.964 --> 00:07:15.866
Then we can ambush that pest!

00:07:15.866 --> 00:07:17.634
[Gunfire]

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:21.838
Tails didn't even wait for
us to double-cross him!

00:07:21.838 --> 00:07:24.107
That twerp is already
one step ahead of you.

00:07:24.107 --> 00:07:27.978
All right, I'll just have to up
the ante by triple-crossing him!

00:07:27.978 --> 00:07:30.447
Oh Doctor, he is
coming at us again!

00:07:30.447 --> 00:07:31.381
Fire!

00:07:33.784 --> 00:07:35.185
Guess he's got me.

00:07:35.185 --> 00:07:38.088
I'd better get out of here, fast!

00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:41.925
[Gasp]

00:07:41.925 --> 00:07:43.860
Hey, what's going on?

00:07:44.461 --> 00:07:46.496
CHUCK: Tails, this is Chuck.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.832
Since you just pulled the
transformation lever,

00:07:48.832 --> 00:07:50.934
I assume you're in
danger right now.

00:07:50.934 --> 00:07:53.470
Don't worry... This new
shield is made of a special

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.340
material that can withstand
almost any assault.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.641
When I heard you were leaving,

00:07:57.641 --> 00:08:00.210
I decided to give
you a secret gift.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.145
I made sure you were
away from the lab,

00:08:02.145 --> 00:08:05.015
and made some modifications
to the X Tornado.

00:08:05.015 --> 00:08:07.918
I'm not as clever
an engineer as you,

00:08:07.918 --> 00:08:11.321
but I don't think I did too
badly for an old-timer.

00:08:11.321 --> 00:08:15.459
Anyway, I did my best, and I
hope your gift comes in handy.

00:08:15.993 --> 00:08:17.394
Thanks, Chuck.

00:08:17.394 --> 00:08:20.297
CHUCK: X Tornado... Transform!

00:08:22.399 --> 00:08:24.301
Now it's the Hyper-Tornado!

00:08:24.301 --> 00:08:26.103
Good luck, Tails.

00:08:27.738 --> 00:08:29.373
Eggman, look out!

00:08:30.073 --> 00:08:31.308
What is that?

00:08:31.308 --> 00:08:33.043
Tails transformed his plane.

00:08:33.043 --> 00:08:35.178
It looks completely different now.

00:08:35.178 --> 00:08:36.880
And more dangerous.

00:08:38.048 --> 00:08:39.583
[All yelling]

00:08:39.583 --> 00:08:41.818
TAILS: Missiles away!

00:08:41.818 --> 00:08:43.120
[All yelling]

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.988
Fire plasma blast!

00:08:45.622 --> 00:08:47.357
[All screaming]

00:08:48.325 --> 00:08:50.861
You've wasted your
time, you little pest,

00:08:50.861 --> 00:08:53.764
because in a few moments,
your plane will be history!

00:08:53.764 --> 00:08:55.165
[Laughing]

00:08:55.165 --> 00:08:57.868
We have the perfect weapon
to take him down, Doctor!

00:08:57.868 --> 00:08:59.536
I'll turn the tables on Tails!

00:08:59.536 --> 00:09:02.673
Let's do a little fox hunting with
our brand-new interceptor missile!

00:09:02.673 --> 00:09:05.342
Roger! All systems are go!

00:09:05.342 --> 00:09:07.711
Begin missile launch sequence now!

00:09:11.348 --> 00:09:14.251
It's coming quick,
but I can trick it!

00:09:17.287 --> 00:09:21.291
If I can't outsmart that
thing, I'll outmaneuver it!

00:09:25.595 --> 00:09:27.390
Here goes!

00:09:33.089 --> 00:09:35.024
Here goes!

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:39.829
So long!

00:09:45.034 --> 00:09:46.002
Ooh hoo hoo hoo!

00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:48.504
I've finally invented
the perfect weapon!

00:09:48.504 --> 00:09:49.906
No matter how hard you try,

00:09:49.906 --> 00:09:52.608
you won't shake that missile
from your tail, Tails!

00:09:52.608 --> 00:09:55.578
This missile is programmed
to only attack your plane!

00:09:55.578 --> 00:09:56.546
[Giggle]

00:09:56.546 --> 00:09:58.014
It adds a personal touch.

00:09:58.014 --> 00:10:00.283
You have really outdone
yourself, Doctor.

00:10:00.283 --> 00:10:02.552
You deserve credit
for creative cruelty.

00:10:02.552 --> 00:10:04.287
Aww.

00:10:07.623 --> 00:10:10.626
It's no use. I can't get away!

00:10:10.626 --> 00:10:12.895
I think Tails has
learned his lesson.

00:10:12.895 --> 00:10:14.897
You can go ahead and
recall the missile.

00:10:14.897 --> 00:10:15.965
Uhh...!

00:10:15.965 --> 00:10:17.300
But how, Doctor?

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.001
Just hit the "Recall" button!

00:10:19.001 --> 00:10:22.338
Eh-heh...! There is
no "Recall" button.

00:10:22.338 --> 00:10:24.307
You didn't install one?

00:10:24.307 --> 00:10:27.410
Thanks to you, Tails really
is going to be destroyed!

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:30.680
With Sonic gone, I can't
afford to lose another enemy!

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.848
Sorry, Doctor.

00:10:31.848 --> 00:10:34.417
There is nothing we can
do to save him now.

00:10:36.419 --> 00:10:39.622
[Alarm sounds]

00:10:39.622 --> 00:10:40.890
This is it.

00:10:54.604 --> 00:10:55.605
Huh?

00:10:55.605 --> 00:10:56.539
Ah!

00:11:07.216 --> 00:11:08.351
Oh!

00:11:08.951 --> 00:11:11.254
Hi, Eggman. What's up?

00:11:12.522 --> 00:11:13.923
[Laughter]

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:16.993
Ah, you're finally here!

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.928
[Chuckling]

00:11:19.896 --> 00:11:22.098
You won't be conquering
this world, either.

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:24.100
That's what you think, Super Sap!

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.102
If you dare to interfere
with my plans,

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:27.937
I'll squash you like a bug!

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:28.805
[Explosion]

00:11:28.805 --> 00:11:34.177
Aaaaaaaah!

00:11:41.818 --> 00:11:45.087
Boy, it's good to
have my buddy back.

00:11:47.857 --> 00:11:49.625
BOKKUN: Aww, I can't believe it!

00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:52.261
Sonic beat us without
even breakin' a sweat!

00:11:52.261 --> 00:11:54.197
DECOE: Why did he
have to come back?

00:11:54.197 --> 00:11:57.733
BOCOE: We'll never take over this
world with Sonic hanging around.

00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:00.636
Excuse me, Doctor,

00:12:00.636 --> 00:12:03.539
But why do you have
a smile on your face?

00:12:03.539 --> 00:12:04.907
You should be miserable.

00:12:04.907 --> 00:12:06.809
Sonic totally destroyed us.

00:12:06.809 --> 00:12:09.145
It's not whether you win or lose—

00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:11.314
it's how you plot your revenge!

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:13.249
We'll get even with him!

00:12:13.249 --> 00:12:16.152
[All laugh evilly]

00:12:16.919 --> 00:12:18.354
Ugh! Oof!

00:12:18.354 --> 00:12:22.725
So, do ya give up yet?

00:12:22.725 --> 00:12:25.628
Are you kidding? I'm
just warming up!

00:12:26.229 --> 00:12:27.697
Huh?

00:12:28.664 --> 00:12:29.732
That's him!

00:12:31.667 --> 00:12:33.603
Well, whaddaya you know?

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:38.474
I guess neither of us knows very much
about how those time warps work.

00:12:38.474 --> 00:12:40.910
[Laughing]

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:42.044
You look awful.

00:12:43.212 --> 00:12:44.413
Yeah?

00:12:44.413 --> 00:12:45.448
[Laughing]

00:12:45.448 --> 00:12:46.749
Stop! That tickles!

00:12:46.749 --> 00:12:48.885
Didn't I warn you to behave?

00:12:48.885 --> 00:12:50.786
All right, all right!

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.457
[Panting]

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:35.791
Hi!

00:14:35.791 --> 00:14:38.894
Well, what took you so long?

00:14:38.894 --> 00:14:40.830
I was worried!

00:14:41.797 --> 00:14:44.700
I wondered if you were
ever going to come back.

00:14:45.234 --> 00:14:50.272
It scared me to think that I
was never gonna see you again.

00:14:50.272 --> 00:14:51.107
[Gasping for air]

00:14:51.107 --> 00:14:54.877
Day after day, I waited for you
to come, but you never did.

00:14:55.411 --> 00:14:57.046
I didn't know where you were.

00:14:57.046 --> 00:14:59.015
I couldn't stand not knowing.

00:14:59.015 --> 00:14:59.915
[Crying]

00:14:59.915 --> 00:15:03.386
I told myself I should
give up hoping.

00:15:03.386 --> 00:15:07.223
I was convinced that you'd
forgotten all about me.

00:15:07.757 --> 00:15:09.692
I thought you were gone forever.

00:15:09.692 --> 00:15:11.460
[Crying]

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:15.498
But then I realized that
you had never abandoned me.

00:15:15.498 --> 00:15:19.368
And I decided that I
would wait for you,

00:15:19.368 --> 00:15:23.172
even if it took the rest of
my life to see you again.

00:15:25.641 --> 00:15:27.009
Now you're here.

00:15:27.009 --> 00:15:30.913
I'm so glad to finally
have you back, Sonic!

00:15:30.913 --> 00:15:32.848
It's such a wonderful feeling!

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:36.852
I don't think I've ever been
as happy as I am right now!

00:15:36.852 --> 00:15:41.057
[Sobbing]

00:15:41.057 --> 00:15:44.927
Don't you ever leave me
again, Sonic the Hedgehog!

00:15:44.927 --> 00:15:48.130
[Sobbing]

00:15:49.098 --> 00:15:50.599
Don't you worry, Amy.

00:15:50.599 --> 00:15:52.134
I never will.

00:15:52.134 --> 00:15:54.537
[Gasp]

00:15:55.037 --> 00:15:58.307
AMY: [Crying]
SONIC: Huh?

00:15:58.307 --> 00:16:09.919
[Sobbing]

00:16:23.971 --> 00:16:27.375
HELEN: Chris, it's time.

00:16:27.375 --> 00:16:29.243
Oh, yeah!

00:16:29.243 --> 00:16:30.177
That's right!

00:16:30.177 --> 00:16:32.680
We're supposed to meet Danny
and Francis for lunch today.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.049
CHRIS: Let's go!
HELEN: Woah! Easy, Chris.

00:16:35.049 --> 00:16:36.784
They know you're always late.

00:16:41.722 --> 00:16:43.658
Why don't you let me
drive for a change?

00:16:43.658 --> 00:16:44.625
No way.

00:16:44.625 --> 00:16:47.495
Chuck designed this car
especially for me, remember?

00:16:47.495 --> 00:16:51.799
And besides, riding while you
drive is too nerve-racking.

00:16:51.799 --> 00:16:53.034
What does that mean?

00:16:53.034 --> 00:16:54.702
I'm a much better driver.

00:16:54.702 --> 00:16:56.637
I've never even gotten
a parking ticket,

00:16:56.637 --> 00:16:58.272
which is more than
I can say for you!

00:16:58.272 --> 00:17:01.509
It's not my fault somebody turned
that one-way sign around.

00:17:02.309 --> 00:17:05.546
So, who's gonna test out
your machine, Chris?

00:17:05.546 --> 00:17:07.448
Why don't you send me, Chris?

00:17:07.448 --> 00:17:10.051
I'm not afraid to be the
first one to give it a try.

00:17:10.051 --> 00:17:11.218
It's not ready yet.

00:17:11.218 --> 00:17:12.653
My machine's totally useless

00:17:12.653 --> 00:17:14.889
'til I can figure out how
to cause Chaos Control.

00:17:14.889 --> 00:17:16.323
But as soon as he does,

00:17:16.323 --> 00:17:18.559
we'll all be able to go
to Sonic's world together.

00:17:18.559 --> 00:17:20.394
Sounds dangerous to me.

00:17:20.394 --> 00:17:23.397
Yeah, if Chris messes it
up, we could all be toast.

00:17:23.397 --> 00:17:25.266
Well, you don't have
to come with me, then.

00:17:25.266 --> 00:17:27.501
[All laugh]

00:17:27.501 --> 00:17:30.638
Hard to believe it's
been six years already.

00:17:31.272 --> 00:17:32.740
Mmm.

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:34.175
It went fast.

00:17:35.443 --> 00:17:37.678
Yeah, almost at sonic speed.

00:17:40.014 --> 00:17:41.449
Sonic...

00:17:44.218 --> 00:17:46.287
You collected the Chaos Emeralds!

00:17:46.287 --> 00:17:47.855
Now I see!

00:17:47.855 --> 00:17:50.925
You don't need the machine
that Tails and Grandpa built.

00:17:50.925 --> 00:17:53.527
You can cause Chaos
Control yourself.

00:17:53.527 --> 00:17:56.797
You were able to gather
'em all in a flash

00:17:56.797 --> 00:17:59.033
because you're so fast.

00:18:00.501 --> 00:18:02.903
Even though I've been
tough to deal with lately,

00:18:02.903 --> 00:18:04.839
you never gave up on me, Sonic.

00:18:05.806 --> 00:18:07.408
Thank you.

00:18:08.375 --> 00:18:09.143
Chris?

00:18:09.143 --> 00:18:10.044
Huh?

00:18:11.045 --> 00:18:13.047
Uh... Aah!

00:18:13.047 --> 00:18:15.015
I'm gonna go really fast!

00:18:15.015 --> 00:18:16.584
Hang on!

00:18:18.519 --> 00:18:19.754
Stop this, Shadow.

00:18:19.754 --> 00:18:21.689
Please, you have to listen to me.

00:18:21.689 --> 00:18:23.824
How can you blame
people alive today

00:18:23.824 --> 00:18:26.160
for things that
happened 50 years ago?

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.762
Can't you see it's not fair?

00:18:27.762 --> 00:18:30.397
Don't talk to me about fair...

00:18:30.397 --> 00:18:32.600
Not after what happened here.

00:18:33.567 --> 00:18:35.536
People need you, Shadow.

00:18:38.439 --> 00:18:39.673
I am Shadow—

00:18:39.673 --> 00:18:40.274
[grunt]

00:18:40.274 --> 00:18:42.243
Shadow the Hedgehog.

00:18:56.724 --> 00:18:58.359
No!

00:18:58.359 --> 00:18:59.827
[Groaning]

00:18:59.827 --> 00:19:01.061
Aaah!

00:19:01.061 --> 00:19:02.029
Whoa!

00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:04.198
[Grunting]

00:19:04.198 --> 00:19:05.566
They're mine.

00:19:05.566 --> 00:19:07.835
I won't let you take
them from me—

00:19:07.835 --> 00:19:09.770
[Grunt] —ever again!

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:10.938
[Groaning]

00:19:12.706 --> 00:19:14.275
Hmm.

00:19:14.275 --> 00:19:15.242
Ohh.

00:19:17.578 --> 00:19:19.647
Sonic, take me with you.

00:19:23.918 --> 00:19:25.085
Huh?

00:19:25.486 --> 00:19:26.754
Ah!

00:19:26.754 --> 00:19:29.356
Sonic, please don't leave.

00:19:29.356 --> 00:19:31.559
You're the best friend I ever had.

00:19:31.559 --> 00:19:33.460
I don't want you to go away.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:34.428
Ah!

00:19:34.428 --> 00:19:35.396
Huh?

00:19:35.396 --> 00:19:36.330
Huh.

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:44.038
That was close.

00:19:44.038 --> 00:19:45.606
Are you okay?

00:19:47.041 --> 00:19:48.008
Ugh. Yeah.

00:19:48.008 --> 00:19:49.276
Thanks a lot.

00:19:50.077 --> 00:19:52.413
I didn't think you could talk.

00:19:52.413 --> 00:19:53.948
Well, I can do a lot of things.

00:19:54.915 --> 00:19:56.851
Wow, that's awesome!—

00:19:56.851 --> 00:19:58.385
that you can talk, I mean.

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:11.098
[Crying]

00:20:12.666 --> 00:20:14.969
Sonic!
