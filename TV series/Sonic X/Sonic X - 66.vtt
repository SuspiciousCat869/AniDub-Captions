[Grunt]

00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:21.922
That should do it.

00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:24.758
All right, Tails, everything's
tightened up, and good to go.

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:26.760
You can take off
whenever you're ready.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.061
TAILS: Roger.

00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:33.500
[All gasp]

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:38.438
So way beyond that gravity pool,

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:40.106
there's an even
deeper part of space

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:42.442
called the Intergalactic Cloister?

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:45.512
I'm no expert, but it sounds
pretty accurate to me.

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:46.546
Mm.

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:53.820
Something bothering you?

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.221
I've been thinking.

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:56.323
Huh?

00:00:56.323 --> 00:01:00.093
Everyone back home must be worrying
an awful lot about you these days.

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:02.796
I feel like we oughta figure out
a way to get you back there.

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:03.830
Don't you think?

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.699
But... how can you say that?

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:09.235
You think I could just abandon you
to battle those Metarex alone?

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.904
There's no way.

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:16.676
Mm...

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:21.848
Yeah, I guess you're right.

00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:23.049
Huh?

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.452
Sure I am.

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:29.122
And besides, don't
forget I'm 18 now,

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:31.057
which means I get
to be your chaperone

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:33.093
so you won't get into
too much trouble.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.361
Chaperone?

00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:35.996
That's right.

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:39.099
[Both laugh]

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:58.952
Typhoon Laser Shield, activate!

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:10.096
8, 7, 6, 5, 4...

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:12.532
3, 2, 1.

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:14.534
Here we go!

00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:20.874
Go, go, go, go, go

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:23.977
Gotta go fast

00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:26.913
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:32.719
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.788
Got ourselves a situation

00:02:34.788 --> 00:02:36.823
Stuck in a new location

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:40.427
Without any explanation

00:02:40.427 --> 00:02:42.495
No talk of relaxation

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.130
Don't, don't, don't

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.932
Don't blink, don't think

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:47.701
Just go, go, go, go

00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:49.202
Go, go

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:54.774
Sonic is on the run

00:02:54.774 --> 00:02:56.676
Sonic, he's number one

00:02:56.676 --> 00:03:00.380
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.084
-<i>Gotta go fast</i>

Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.628
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:16.663
Sonic X

[Gasp]

00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:35.056
We're gonna make it, aren't we?

00:03:35.824 --> 00:03:36.891
Mm-hmm.

00:03:36.891 --> 00:03:37.826
[Gasp]

00:03:37.826 --> 00:03:41.096
[Distorted gasping]

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:42.764
Freaky...

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.968
Uhh...

00:03:46.968 --> 00:03:49.471
I feel really weird...

00:03:49.471 --> 00:03:51.239
Aah!

00:03:53.908 --> 00:03:56.945
[All gasp]

00:04:02.851 --> 00:04:04.786
What's going on?

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:06.354
[Groan]

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:20.835
Everybody okay?

00:04:20.835 --> 00:04:22.270

00:04:27.108 --> 00:04:28.843
[Groggy]

00:04:28.843 --> 00:04:30.345
Where are we?

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.419
It looks so strange.

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.621
Strange isn't the word for it.

00:04:39.621 --> 00:04:40.922
We're in the cloister.

00:04:40.922 --> 00:04:42.190
We made it.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.359
Now we gotta get to the other side.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.339
This place is more
twisted than I thought.

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:59.507
Twisted is right.

00:04:59.507 --> 00:05:02.110
That's space debris from
surrounding planets

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.079
left to float around in space.

00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:05.513
Looks gross, if you ask me.

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:06.981
[All gasp]

00:05:10.985 --> 00:05:13.154
What's the matter, Tails?

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:16.157
[Beeping]

00:05:16.157 --> 00:05:18.093
I think we're trapped.

00:05:25.433 --> 00:05:28.470
My sister Galaxina and I
used to love gardening.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.105
It's great therapy.

00:05:30.105 --> 00:05:31.573
KNUCKLES: Yeah, sure.

00:05:31.573 --> 00:05:35.043
Cutting through unidentified space
gunk really does it for me, too.

00:05:35.043 --> 00:05:36.511
Just shut it, and cut it.

00:05:39.414 --> 00:05:40.715
What's that you've got?

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:42.617
A laser-powered weed-whacker.

00:05:42.617 --> 00:05:44.886
I made it when I used to help
Ella with her gardening.

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:46.754
Now tackling stubborn
weeds is a breeze!

00:05:46.754 --> 00:05:48.523
Well, hand it over.

00:05:48.523 --> 00:05:50.024
Huh?

00:05:50.024 --> 00:05:50.992
But I-

00:05:50.992 --> 00:05:52.460
We've got a better idea.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.261
Huh?

00:06:02.804 --> 00:06:05.340
He's using your power
shoes to cut the vines.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.474
Mm-hmm.

00:06:06.474 --> 00:06:08.076
Whoa!

00:06:21.956 --> 00:06:23.591
Well, that wasn't too hard.

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:25.960
They might not be so easy.

00:06:32.066 --> 00:06:33.301
Ohh!

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.677
DARK OAK: Perfect. Their
ship cannot leave now.

00:06:42.677 --> 00:06:43.845
As of this moment,

00:06:43.845 --> 00:06:46.948
those fools are conveniently
stranded inside the cloister.

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:48.249
What fun!

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:49.217
[Evil laughter]

00:06:49.217 --> 00:06:51.452
I implore you, Master. Send me!

00:06:51.452 --> 00:06:51.986
No.

00:06:51.986 --> 00:06:54.255
Grant me the honor, oh mighty one.

[Growling]

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:06.434
This task requires strength.

00:07:06.434 --> 00:07:10.004
It is I who should
go, Yellow Zelkova!

00:07:10.004 --> 00:07:12.674
Zelkova, enough of
this foolishness.

00:07:12.674 --> 00:07:15.810
I will indeed send you to dispose
of those meddling fools.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:16.945
But I warn you...

00:07:16.945 --> 00:07:19.514
I want that hedgehog destroyed!

00:07:19.514 --> 00:07:21.983
I shall not betray
your trust, Master.

How could the master choose
that buffoon, Zelkova?

00:07:34.295 --> 00:07:37.198
It is not for us to
decide, Narcissus.

00:07:37.198 --> 00:07:39.267
We must wait and see.

00:07:44.372 --> 00:07:46.441
They just came out of nowhere.

00:07:46.441 --> 00:07:48.676
Another dirty Metarex trick.

00:07:48.676 --> 00:07:50.979
Looks like we're
not going anywhere.

Wait a minute. We can't
give up that easy.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.656
We've just got to put
our heads together.

00:08:01.656 --> 00:08:02.890
Yeah.

00:08:16.137 --> 00:08:18.473
Uh, that worked well.

00:08:18.473 --> 00:08:19.340
Ah.

Chris, something's coming.

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:27.415
Yeah, something big.

[Growling]

00:08:29.617 --> 00:08:31.152
We have to be ready.

00:08:31.152 --> 00:08:32.220
Yeah.

You will find out soon
enough, my friend.

Nothing will stand in
the way of my task.

with him are doomed!

This isn't just Eggman we're
dealing with, now get inside!

you how it is done.

00:10:34.936 --> 00:10:36.004
Uh-oh.

00:10:37.171 --> 00:10:38.339
[Yelling]

00:10:38.339 --> 00:10:39.707
Knuckles, no!

00:10:42.777 --> 00:10:43.978
[Grunting]

00:10:43.978 --> 00:10:45.013
Ah!

00:10:45.013 --> 00:10:46.514
[All gasp]

00:10:46.514 --> 00:10:47.782
Oh, no! Sonic!

00:10:47.782 --> 00:10:49.684
Whoa!

00:10:50.685 --> 00:10:51.753
Oof!

00:10:51.753 --> 00:10:52.787
[Growling]

00:10:52.787 --> 00:10:54.455
There's no way we can beat him.

00:10:54.455 --> 00:10:55.523
He's too strong for us.

00:10:55.523 --> 00:10:59.627
Big boy may be strong, but there's
one thing he's not--speedy!

00:10:59.627 --> 00:11:01.796
[Growling]

00:11:04.198 --> 00:11:06.134
He has vanished.

00:11:06.134 --> 00:11:07.702
Huh?

00:11:07.702 --> 00:11:11.739
You've gotta be quicker than that
if you wanna keep up with me.

00:11:11.739 --> 00:11:13.841
I'll show you, hedgehog!

00:11:13.841 --> 00:11:19.280
[Grunting]

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.482
You come down from there.

00:11:21.482 --> 00:11:22.684
Whoa! [Chuckling]

00:11:22.684 --> 00:11:24.986
[Laughing]

00:11:24.986 --> 00:11:26.988
[All gasp]

00:11:26.988 --> 00:11:28.923
We have to do something.

00:11:28.923 --> 00:11:31.025
That awful monster's
going to smash him.

00:11:31.025 --> 00:11:32.493
Chao chao chao!

00:11:32.493 --> 00:11:33.461
[Grunting]

00:11:34.429 --> 00:11:36.364
Ah!

00:11:36.364 --> 00:11:37.331
Whoa!

00:11:38.499 --> 00:11:39.701
Oof!

00:11:41.135 --> 00:11:43.237
[Grunting]

00:11:44.205 --> 00:11:45.173
Ah!

00:11:45.573 --> 00:11:47.108
[Grunting]

00:11:47.108 --> 00:11:48.976
[Growling]

00:11:48.976 --> 00:11:50.511
So, you think just
because I'm little.

00:11:50.511 --> 00:11:52.980
I'm no match for you, is that it?

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.983
I should think that would
be obvious, my friend.

00:11:55.983 --> 00:11:57.185
[Grimacing]

00:11:57.185 --> 00:11:59.754
Well, you're wrong... my friend.

00:11:59.754 --> 00:12:03.357
We shall see how wrong I am
after I have pulverized you

00:12:03.357 --> 00:12:05.093
and the rest of your tiny team.

00:12:05.093 --> 00:12:06.861
Give up. You cannot win.

00:12:06.861 --> 00:12:08.796
Okay!

00:12:08.796 --> 00:12:10.732
That about does it!

00:12:10.732 --> 00:12:12.867
[Grunting] Take that, Meta-dope!

00:12:12.867 --> 00:12:14.402
Aah!

00:12:14.402 --> 00:12:16.003
Did he really just do that?

00:12:16.003 --> 00:12:17.071
Oh, my.

00:12:17.505 --> 00:12:19.006
Uhh! Oof!

00:12:21.809 --> 00:12:23.277
That's done.

00:12:24.378 --> 00:12:25.379
Ah!

00:12:30.752 --> 00:12:32.186
[Laughter]

00:12:32.186 --> 00:12:33.654
Not quite, my friend.

00:12:33.654 --> 00:12:36.023
But--but that can't be.

00:12:36.457 --> 00:12:38.926
We shall see who will destroy whom.

00:12:39.894 --> 00:12:41.796
[Grunting]

00:12:41.796 --> 00:12:42.597
Aaah!

00:12:42.597 --> 00:12:43.431
Oof!

00:12:43.431 --> 00:12:46.868
Aaah!

00:12:47.468 --> 00:12:48.503
Knuckles!

00:12:48.503 --> 00:12:49.837
Is he okay?

00:12:49.837 --> 00:12:51.773
[Groaning]

00:12:51.773 --> 00:12:52.907
[Moaning]

00:12:54.809 --> 00:12:56.811
Ugh...

00:12:57.278 --> 00:12:59.714
Prepare for your doom!

00:12:59.714 --> 00:13:01.682
[Laughing]

00:13:05.087 --> 00:13:06.756
[Growling]

00:13:06.756 --> 00:13:08.224
Right on time.

00:13:08.224 --> 00:13:09.959
Ah!

00:13:20.236 --> 00:13:22.605
This is gonna take
some fancy footwork.

00:13:22.605 --> 00:13:24.373
Now you go over there, and...

00:13:24.373 --> 00:13:25.508
[Whispers]

00:13:25.508 --> 00:13:26.475
You got it?

00:13:26.475 --> 00:13:29.011
[Chuckling] Got it.

00:13:29.011 --> 00:13:30.046
-Hm!

00:13:31.013 --> 00:13:32.281
Where are they?

00:13:32.281 --> 00:13:34.884
How can I destroy them
when they move so quickly?

00:13:34.884 --> 00:13:36.318
What's the matter, buddy?

00:13:36.318 --> 00:13:39.188
I thought you said it was
big, bad demolition time?

00:13:39.188 --> 00:13:40.423
Huh?

00:13:42.358 --> 00:13:43.759
Hmm!

00:13:44.326 --> 00:13:45.327
Huh?

00:13:47.463 --> 00:13:48.764
Hm!

00:13:48.764 --> 00:13:50.833
Ha! Come and get me.

00:13:50.833 --> 00:13:52.768
You asked for it!

00:13:52.768 --> 00:13:54.970
[Growling]

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:01.610
[All scream]

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.779
Show yourself, hedgehog!

00:14:03.779 --> 00:14:06.215
KNUCKLES: Hey! Over here!

00:14:06.215 --> 00:14:06.849
Hmm?

00:14:06.849 --> 00:14:10.019
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na!

00:14:10.019 --> 00:14:11.954
Are you toying with me?

00:14:11.954 --> 00:14:13.589
[Growling]

00:14:15.591 --> 00:14:18.060
[All scream]

00:14:18.561 --> 00:14:20.529
let's do this, Knuckles.

00:14:20.529 --> 00:14:21.664
Ha ha!

00:14:21.664 --> 00:14:22.498
Hm!

00:14:23.466 --> 00:14:24.900
Hmm?

00:14:26.969 --> 00:14:29.371
Hey, what are you
waiting for, big fella?

00:14:29.371 --> 00:14:30.706
I think he's chicken.

00:14:30.706 --> 00:14:31.874
Come on, chicken boy.

00:14:31.874 --> 00:14:33.209
We're ready for you.

00:14:33.209 --> 00:14:35.511
You mock the great Zelkova?

00:14:35.511 --> 00:14:36.679
Grrr!

00:14:39.048 --> 00:14:40.282
Oof!

00:14:42.184 --> 00:14:43.719
[All gasp]

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.489
Hey! What are those two doing?

00:14:46.489 --> 00:14:48.691
Are they gonna battle that
thing, or aren't they?

00:14:51.193 --> 00:14:54.029
Your clever taunting
has come to an end.

00:14:54.029 --> 00:14:55.965
BOTH: Yeah, whatever.

00:14:55.965 --> 00:14:57.032
-Huh!

00:14:59.034 --> 00:15:02.071
[All scream]

00:15:02.071 --> 00:15:05.007
Your foolishness grows more
wearisome by the minute.

00:15:05.007 --> 00:15:06.709
Will you fight me, or not?

00:15:06.709 --> 00:15:09.044
Sure, we'll fight ya.

00:15:11.647 --> 00:15:14.049
Then come down here.

00:15:14.049 --> 00:15:16.352
I think we've kept him
waiting long enough.

00:15:16.352 --> 00:15:17.520
What do you say?

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.355
It's show time.

00:15:20.456 --> 00:15:23.125
I've had enough of your games.

00:15:23.125 --> 00:15:26.428
Your pathetic attempts
at victory are at an end.

00:15:26.428 --> 00:15:28.397
[Laughing]

00:15:28.397 --> 00:15:30.099
Get ready, Tails.

00:15:31.167 --> 00:15:33.636
Time for Sonic Power Cannon.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:37.273
Huh? Sonic what?

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.775
Later.

00:15:39.775 --> 00:15:41.310
What are you doing?

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.412
You think you can fool Zelkova?

00:15:43.412 --> 00:15:45.080
Prepare the main cannon.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.249
Activate energy link.

00:15:58.127 --> 00:16:00.496
This is gonna be fun. [Chuckling]

00:16:00.496 --> 00:16:03.132
TAILS: Increase pressure
in main detonator.

00:16:03.132 --> 00:16:04.366
Power level set.

00:16:04.366 --> 00:16:06.268
Okay, Sonic. Get in position.

00:16:06.268 --> 00:16:07.636
Here goes.

00:16:10.906 --> 00:16:13.075
Deactivate safety trigger.

00:16:13.075 --> 00:16:16.212
Target locked on
"B" for bull's-eye.

00:16:19.315 --> 00:16:20.316
Hmm?

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:22.751
Hm...

00:16:22.751 --> 00:16:25.254
TAILS: Launch Sonic
Power Cannon now!

00:16:32.795 --> 00:16:33.963
Huh!

00:16:36.932 --> 00:16:38.901
What is happening?

00:16:38.901 --> 00:16:40.336
The light is too bright.

00:16:40.336 --> 00:16:41.737
I cannot see.

00:16:41.737 --> 00:16:42.905
Where are you, Sonic?

00:16:42.905 --> 00:16:43.873
I thought you were brave.

00:16:43.873 --> 00:16:46.275
Show yourself. I command you!

00:16:46.275 --> 00:16:47.142
Ah!

00:16:47.142 --> 00:16:49.378
Aaaaaaahhh!

00:16:49.378 --> 00:16:50.813
Aaaah!

00:16:50.813 --> 00:16:52.047
Aaaaah!

00:16:52.047 --> 00:16:54.516
[Screaming]

00:16:54.516 --> 00:16:55.718
Direct hit!

00:16:55.718 --> 00:16:57.786
Now to break down those rocks.

00:16:57.786 --> 00:16:58.954
Knuckles, ready?

00:16:58.954 --> 00:17:01.624
Yep. Let's charge up.

00:17:02.591 --> 00:17:06.462
Master Emerald, can you hear me?

00:17:14.236 --> 00:17:17.139
Give us all your power.

00:17:24.046 --> 00:17:26.181
No! The barriers! They mustn't!

00:17:35.824 --> 00:17:37.393
[Panting]

00:17:37.393 --> 00:17:38.961
Start the engine, Tails!

00:18:23.872 --> 00:18:25.407
You will not get far.

00:18:25.407 --> 00:18:28.210
The great master Dark Oak
has more in store for you.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:29.311
Mark my words.

00:18:29.311 --> 00:18:30.846
We will destroy you yet!

00:18:30.846 --> 00:18:31.814
Sure.

00:18:31.814 --> 00:18:34.750
You bring it on, Meta-loser,
and we'll be waiting for you.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.119
And give the boss man
our regards, huh?

00:18:37.119 --> 00:18:39.421
Huh? Hm.

00:18:40.289 --> 00:18:41.790
Sonic!

00:18:43.726 --> 00:18:44.693
Huh!

00:18:44.693 --> 00:18:46.228
You're okay!

00:19:03.846 --> 00:19:05.447
Thanks to Sonic and Knuckles,

00:19:05.447 --> 00:19:08.117
we made it through that cloister
with hardly a scratch.

00:19:08.117 --> 00:19:09.084
Chao chao!

00:19:19.461 --> 00:19:21.263
Good going, gang!

00:19:23.365 --> 00:19:25.601
Yeah, we made it this far,

00:19:25.601 --> 00:19:28.303
but who knows what'll happen
when we get out there.

00:19:28.303 --> 00:19:29.371
Hm.
