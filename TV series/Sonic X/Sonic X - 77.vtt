00:00:00.234 --> 00:00:01.602
Last time on Sonic X,

00:00:01.602 --> 00:00:03.770
in a last ditch effort
to save the galaxy,

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.540
Sonic and company decided to
use the mighty Master Emerald

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.875
to attack the Metarex.

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:09.476
The giant gem was shattered,

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:10.878
but Sonic spread through space,

00:00:10.878 --> 00:00:13.113
and the blast created an
opening for our heroes.

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:15.249
Just as Sonic rushed
to confront Dark Oak,

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:17.317
he found himself in
a sticky situation.

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:20.487
Amy quickly flew in to free
him, but was also trapped!

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:23.156
Now, as Dark Oak begins
his final transformation,

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:25.392
Sonic must find a way
to win against the odds.

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:28.962
Can he and his friends rally to stop
the Metarex and their maniacal mission?

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:30.898
Find out next on Sonic X!

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:33.667
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:36.737
Gotta go fast

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:39.673
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:45.512
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:47.581
Got ourselves a situation

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:49.616
Stuck in a new location

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:53.220
Without any explanation

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.289
No talk of relaxation

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.924
Don't, don't, don't

00:00:56.924 --> 00:00:58.725
Don't blink, don't think

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.527
Just go, go, go, go

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:02.029
Go, go

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:07.534
Sonic is on the run

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:09.436
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:13.173
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:16.877
-<i>Gotta go fast</i>
-<i>Sonic</i>

00:01:16.877 --> 00:01:19.279
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:21.181
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:23.684
Sonic X

00:01:23.684 --> 00:01:25.619
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:28.422
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:29.456
Sonic X

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.594
So this is the only baby that could
grow from the seeds, Galaxina?

00:01:45.594 --> 00:01:46.595
Yes.

00:01:46.595 --> 00:01:49.364
None of the other seeds
had any signs of life.

00:01:49.364 --> 00:01:52.400
If this keeps up, our
clan won't last for long.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.702
What should we do?

00:01:53.702 --> 00:01:57.772
Earthia has been able to hang on
so far due to the fake Planet Egg,

00:01:57.772 --> 00:02:01.109
but as time goes on, I see she's
definitely getting weaker.

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:02.310
That's her last child.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.978
[All gasp]

00:02:02.978 --> 00:02:04.179
[Crying]

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:05.981
Don't cry, dear.

00:02:06.414 --> 00:02:07.482
I almost forgot...

00:02:07.482 --> 00:02:09.651
We haven't given her a name yet.

00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:10.819
EARTHIA: Cosmo.

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:11.586
[All gasp]

00:02:11.586 --> 00:02:13.155
ALL: Ah!

00:02:13.855 --> 00:02:15.090
Cosmo.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.992
She's the last of my offspring,

00:02:16.992 --> 00:02:19.427
and the last hope for the galaxy.

00:02:19.427 --> 00:02:21.163
Guard and protect her.

00:02:21.163 --> 00:02:23.098
Our future depends on it.

00:02:23.698 --> 00:02:25.200
Did you hear Mother?

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.569
You're a very special baby.

00:02:36.711 --> 00:02:39.014
[Heart beating]

00:02:39.014 --> 00:02:41.016
It looks so strange.

00:02:41.016 --> 00:02:42.751
What is that thing?

00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:44.486
ALL: Hm...

00:02:44.853 --> 00:02:46.221
ALL: Hm...

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:52.561
Mother.

00:02:54.663 --> 00:02:56.865
TAILS: This doesn't look good.

00:02:57.332 --> 00:03:00.202
Its energy is increasing
so rapidly,

00:03:00.202 --> 00:03:02.103
our scanners can't measure it.

00:03:02.103 --> 00:03:02.837
Blast!

00:03:02.837 --> 00:03:06.107
The forestation process is getting
too powerful for us to stop.

00:03:13.882 --> 00:03:15.817
Shadow!

00:03:15.817 --> 00:03:17.319
Let's help him.

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:18.420
Hm.

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:22.857
You'd better hurry!

00:03:22.857 --> 00:03:24.192
Aaaah!

00:03:24.192 --> 00:03:25.927
CHRIS: Ring Tunnel!

00:03:25.927 --> 00:03:27.562
Go, Sonic.

00:03:27.562 --> 00:03:28.263
Hm!

00:03:37.138 --> 00:03:38.707
Ohhh!

00:03:40.742 --> 00:03:41.910
[Grunting]

00:03:45.413 --> 00:03:46.514
[Gasp]

00:03:46.514 --> 00:03:48.183
Ahhh!

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:51.953
AMY: Aaaah!

00:03:51.953 --> 00:03:53.121
SONIC: Amy!

00:03:53.655 --> 00:03:54.389
Uh!

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:55.757
Thanks, Sonic.

00:03:56.391 --> 00:03:58.793
[Groaning]

00:03:58.793 --> 00:03:59.694
Huh?

00:03:59.694 --> 00:04:00.495
[Grunting]

00:04:09.404 --> 00:04:11.339
We got all the Emeralds.

00:04:12.307 --> 00:04:13.308
Huh?

00:04:13.308 --> 00:04:14.042
But look...

00:04:14.042 --> 00:04:15.610
They're useless now.

00:04:17.512 --> 00:04:19.481
Those poor Chaos Emeralds.

00:04:19.481 --> 00:04:21.182
All their power is gone.

00:04:21.182 --> 00:04:22.384
Chao chao!

00:04:22.384 --> 00:04:24.052
That's jut great.

00:04:24.052 --> 00:04:26.121
We don't have a single
working Emerald!

00:04:26.121 --> 00:04:29.491
How can we fight back
without extra power?

00:04:29.491 --> 00:04:30.358
Eggman!

00:04:30.358 --> 00:04:30.925
ALL: Huh?

00:04:30.925 --> 00:04:33.194
Listen. According
to my calculations,

00:04:33.194 --> 00:04:36.398
there's a chance we could restore
the power of the Chaos Emeralds.

00:04:36.398 --> 00:04:39.067
However, it will take the
energy of both our ships.

00:04:39.067 --> 00:04:40.035
Oh?

00:04:40.035 --> 00:04:42.671
Doctor, something's happening!

00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:43.838
Huh?

00:04:55.383 --> 00:04:56.718
Oh!

00:04:57.385 --> 00:04:59.421
ALL: Ahh!

00:05:22.377 --> 00:05:23.378
Uhh...

00:05:23.378 --> 00:05:24.546
You okay?

00:05:25.313 --> 00:05:26.314
Huh!

00:05:26.948 --> 00:05:30.352
[Breathing heavily]

00:05:30.352 --> 00:05:32.620
I'm starting to feel weak.

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:36.024
COSMO: What's happening, Tails?

00:05:36.024 --> 00:05:39.094
[All groaning]

00:05:39.594 --> 00:05:42.964
Dark Oak is taking the life
energy out of our bodies.

00:05:42.964 --> 00:05:46.101
Just like the Metarex did to
all the planets they attacked.

00:05:46.101 --> 00:05:50.939
It's drawing in all energy it can find
to spread plant life across the galaxy.

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:54.109
It's the last stage of
the forestation process.

00:05:58.146 --> 00:05:59.114
[Grunt]

00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:00.915
Huh?

00:06:00.915 --> 00:06:02.450
Cosmo?

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.520
Dark Oak cannot take my
life energy away from me,

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.157
because we both come from
the same species of plant.

00:06:09.157 --> 00:06:11.059
I'll take care of this.

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:12.026
ALL: Huh?

00:06:16.631 --> 00:06:17.999
Huh!

00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:29.377
I'll take these Chaos
Emeralds to Dr. Eggman

00:06:29.377 --> 00:06:31.713
so he can restore their power.

00:06:31.713 --> 00:06:35.583
The Metarex want to wipe out
all animal life in the galaxy,

00:06:35.583 --> 00:06:37.819
but I still believe it's
possible for plant

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:40.422
and animal species
to coexist in peace,

00:06:40.422 --> 00:06:43.758
just like I made friends
with Tails and the others.

00:06:43.758 --> 00:06:47.695
Dark Oak, there's still time
for me to stop your plan!

00:06:47.695 --> 00:06:52.767
[Beeping]

00:06:52.767 --> 00:06:55.670
DARK OAK: You cannot win.

00:06:57.605 --> 00:06:59.040
LUCAS: It's hopeless.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.477
What can one girl do
to stop the Metarex?

00:07:03.545 --> 00:07:04.746
Uh!

00:07:04.746 --> 00:07:06.948
Nothing you can say
will make me give up.

00:07:06.948 --> 00:07:10.118
I have hope... hope
for a better future.

00:07:10.118 --> 00:07:12.587
A future of true peace.

00:07:12.587 --> 00:07:16.424
That's the kind of future my
friends and I are fighting for.

00:07:24.332 --> 00:07:26.267
Huh? Ahh!

00:07:27.769 --> 00:07:32.140
[Screaming]

Ah! [All gasp]

Ahhh...

00:07:43.251 --> 00:07:46.120
Oh!

00:07:46.454 --> 00:07:48.623
I lost the Chaos Emeralds!

00:07:48.623 --> 00:07:50.391
[Grimacing]

00:07:54.295 --> 00:07:55.263
Oh!

00:07:55.263 --> 00:07:56.097
Huh?

00:07:56.965 --> 00:07:58.132
Whoa.

00:07:58.132 --> 00:07:59.000
Huh.

Huh.

00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:08.877
Ah!

00:08:09.978 --> 00:08:10.912
ALL: Hm.

00:08:11.613 --> 00:08:13.348
What's happening?

00:08:13.848 --> 00:08:15.984
We've stopped losing energy.

00:08:20.488 --> 00:08:22.957
It's because of the Planet Egg.

00:08:22.957 --> 00:08:25.593
It appears the life
force the Metarex stole

00:08:25.593 --> 00:08:29.163
from the planets is responding
to the Chaos Emeralds.

00:08:30.098 --> 00:08:31.199
Mm!

00:08:40.108 --> 00:08:41.409
Thank you.

00:08:47.248 --> 00:08:48.116
Oh.

00:08:48.116 --> 00:08:49.951
The pain's gone away.

00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:52.453
Look, Sonic.

What's going on?

teaming up to stop the Metarex.

[Both grunting]

00:09:45.139 --> 00:09:48.075
They'll be okay... I hope.

00:09:56.617 --> 00:09:57.418
ALL: Ah!

Wow...!

00:10:11.966 --> 00:10:14.635
All right!

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:18.139
Heh!

00:10:18.873 --> 00:10:20.174
Something is wrong.

Oh!

00:10:21.709 --> 00:10:24.311
The energy levels are
starting to reverse.

00:10:24.311 --> 00:10:26.947
Hmm. It seems like
it's imploding now.

DARK OAK: Foolish hedgehogs.

00:10:31.485 --> 00:10:33.721
With the help of the Planet
Egg, you have indeed

00:10:33.721 --> 00:10:36.624
prevented me from
transforming the galaxy.

00:10:36.624 --> 00:10:38.959
But you can never win this battle.

00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:41.429
If the Metarex cannot
rule the galaxy,

00:10:41.429 --> 00:10:43.931
then we will destroy it!

[Sinister laughter]

00:10:45.733 --> 00:10:46.867
Oh!

00:10:46.867 --> 00:10:47.768
Ungh!

00:10:47.768 --> 00:10:50.671
TAILS: The pressure inside
that thing is growing fast!

00:10:50.671 --> 00:10:52.873
What's Dark Oak trying to do?

00:10:53.874 --> 00:10:55.276
I know...

00:10:55.276 --> 00:10:58.379
He's producing a huge
gravitational force,

00:10:58.379 --> 00:11:01.482
because he's trying to
crush the Planet Egg.

00:11:01.482 --> 00:11:03.484
But why is he doing that?

00:11:03.484 --> 00:11:05.419
Imagine it's like a big balloon,

00:11:05.419 --> 00:11:08.322
and you keep on squeezing
it tighter and tighter.

00:11:08.322 --> 00:11:11.425
You know what happens sooner
or later, don't you?

00:11:11.425 --> 00:11:13.227
It goes bang!

00:11:13.227 --> 00:11:14.094
Hold on.

00:11:14.094 --> 00:11:16.197
Are you telling us that
thing's going to explode?

00:11:16.197 --> 00:11:18.132
I'm afraid so.

00:11:18.132 --> 00:11:20.201
That sounds bad.

00:11:23.504 --> 00:11:26.974
Dark Oak really is trying
to destroy the galaxy.

00:11:26.974 --> 00:11:28.876
Ugh...

00:11:30.978 --> 00:11:32.379
Aaah!

00:11:35.649 --> 00:11:36.484
Huh!

00:11:38.486 --> 00:11:41.388
Ah!

00:11:43.657 --> 00:11:45.693
[Groaning]

00:11:48.929 --> 00:11:50.865
[Struggling]

00:11:52.366 --> 00:11:55.803
Isn't there anything we can do to help
break through that gravity field?

00:11:55.803 --> 00:11:59.406
Well, I've got one plan
that involves you robots,

00:11:59.406 --> 00:12:00.875
but you won't like it.

00:12:00.875 --> 00:12:01.675
Oh?

00:12:01.675 --> 00:12:04.578
When you were built, I put
special self-destruct circuits

00:12:04.578 --> 00:12:07.448
inside your bodies in case
of an emergency such as this.

00:12:07.448 --> 00:12:10.117
I could set you off to break
through the gravity field.

00:12:10.117 --> 00:12:12.953
But, Dr. Eggman... that
would destroy us, too!

00:12:12.953 --> 00:12:15.623
And besides, that gravity
field is really powerful,

00:12:15.623 --> 00:12:18.425
so it would take a huge amount
of energy to break through.

00:12:18.425 --> 00:12:19.660
Good point!

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:23.163
Eggman, please don't
carry out that plan.

00:12:23.163 --> 00:12:25.099
Don't worry. I won't.

00:12:25.099 --> 00:12:28.168
The explosion wouldn't be strong
enough to penetrate the field.

00:12:28.168 --> 00:12:30.104
Don't you have another
plan up your sleeve?

00:12:30.104 --> 00:12:32.039
We're running out of time here!

00:12:32.039 --> 00:12:34.174
You claim to be a
scientific genius.

00:12:34.174 --> 00:12:37.177
This would be the perfect opportunity
to prove it to all of us.

00:12:37.177 --> 00:12:38.178
Huh!

00:12:38.178 --> 00:12:39.947
Ah!

00:12:39.947 --> 00:12:41.148
[Both straining]

00:12:41.148 --> 00:12:42.850
Don't use that ring yet.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:43.918
Huh?

00:12:43.918 --> 00:12:46.954
In a few seconds, we're gonna
need all the power we can get.

00:12:47.922 --> 00:12:49.857
Hm...

00:12:49.857 --> 00:12:51.959
Listen up, everybody.

00:12:51.959 --> 00:12:54.395
Our only hope of saving
the galaxy is to throw

00:12:54.395 --> 00:12:57.665
all the energy we've got at
this gravity field in one shot.

00:12:58.265 --> 00:13:02.002
Use the Sonic Power Cannon
and launch me at it.

00:13:02.002 --> 00:13:03.971
It's way too risky.

00:13:03.971 --> 00:13:06.073
We've never launched you from
the Power Cannon before

00:13:06.073 --> 00:13:07.942
when you were Super Sonic.

00:13:07.942 --> 00:13:10.678
We don't have any idea
what'll happen to you.

00:13:10.678 --> 00:13:13.547
That gravity field is
extremely powerful, Sonic.

00:13:13.547 --> 00:13:16.984
If you smash into it, the force could
be too much for your body to take.

00:13:16.984 --> 00:13:17.818
Huh!

00:13:17.818 --> 00:13:19.653
You mean to tell us there's
a good chance Sonic

00:13:19.653 --> 00:13:21.956
won't even survive the attack?

00:13:21.956 --> 00:13:23.524
He can't do it!

00:13:23.524 --> 00:13:25.426
We have to come up
with another plan!

00:13:25.426 --> 00:13:29.930
I don't know if I can save the
galaxy, but I have to try.

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:30.764
[Gasp]

00:13:30.764 --> 00:13:33.500
And there's no way anybody's
gonna talk me out of it,

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.935
so save your breath.

00:13:34.935 --> 00:13:36.870
Now, are you gonna help me or not?

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:38.639
Let's do it!

00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:39.873
SONIC: Great!

00:13:41.275 --> 00:13:44.979
I'm routing all the energy in
the network to the Power Cannon.

00:13:44.979 --> 00:13:47.514
We only have one chance to
break through that field.

00:13:47.514 --> 00:13:49.350
We'll need all the
energy we can get.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:52.119
Prepare to transfer all
power to the Blue Typhoon.

00:13:52.119 --> 00:13:54.388
Cutting off the ship's
energy supply now

00:13:54.388 --> 00:13:56.857
and sending it to the
Sonic Power Cannon.

00:14:03.964 --> 00:14:05.633
Be honest, Doctor.

00:14:05.633 --> 00:14:07.568
I wanna know what you think.

00:14:07.568 --> 00:14:10.070
Does Sonic have a chance
of saving the galaxy?

00:14:11.405 --> 00:14:12.806
Hmm.

00:14:13.307 --> 00:14:16.176
I'm so nervous, I can't even look.

00:14:16.677 --> 00:14:18.646
I feel helpless.

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.081
EARTHIA: Cosmo.

00:14:21.081 --> 00:14:22.116
Huh?

00:14:22.116 --> 00:14:24.518
This is the moment
we've been waiting for.

00:14:24.518 --> 00:14:27.421
You can help save the
galaxy and our clan

00:14:27.421 --> 00:14:29.857
if you only believe in yourself.

00:14:30.824 --> 00:14:32.726
This is why I was sent here.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.029
Are you okay?

00:14:35.996 --> 00:14:38.032
I understand now.

00:14:38.032 --> 00:14:40.634
There can be peace in the galaxy,

00:14:40.634 --> 00:14:43.537
and I have the power to
make it happen, Cream.

00:14:44.138 --> 00:14:45.773
What do you mean?

00:14:45.773 --> 00:14:47.708
Ah!

00:14:49.276 --> 00:14:51.178
Where are you going?

00:15:08.862 --> 00:15:10.631
[Deep breath]

00:15:17.371 --> 00:15:19.339
No! Come back!

00:15:19.339 --> 00:15:19.973
[Crying]

00:15:19.973 --> 00:15:21.375
What's wrong?

00:15:21.375 --> 00:15:25.245
Cosmo's out there to
help stop Dark Oak.

00:15:37.554 --> 00:15:38.855
Huh?

00:15:38.855 --> 00:15:40.490
Why are you here?

00:15:45.061 --> 00:15:48.198
Mother, I feel really happy
now, because I finally

00:15:48.198 --> 00:15:50.133
know what my purpose is.

00:15:50.834 --> 00:15:51.768
Huh!

00:15:51.768 --> 00:15:52.702
Oh!

00:15:54.037 --> 00:15:56.539
My friends mean more
to me than anything.

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:59.409
That's why I'd give up
everything to save them.

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.588
Whoa!

00:16:12.122 --> 00:16:13.857
[All gasp]

00:16:15.291 --> 00:16:17.093
What's she doing?

00:16:18.495 --> 00:16:19.662
EARTHIA: Cosmo.

00:16:19.662 --> 00:16:23.099
You can transform and pass
through the gravity field.

00:16:23.099 --> 00:16:25.869
In your new form,
you will be like me.

00:16:25.869 --> 00:16:28.371
Your destiny will be fulfilled.

00:16:28.371 --> 00:16:31.307
You have the power to stop Dark Oak

00:16:31.307 --> 00:16:34.310
and bring new life to our clan.

00:16:41.618 --> 00:16:42.585
ALL: Huh?

00:16:43.019 --> 00:16:44.053
Whoa!

00:16:44.521 --> 00:16:45.422
Huh.

00:16:45.422 --> 00:16:47.056
Wow!

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:01.304
It's all right. I have
Dark Oak immobilized.

00:17:01.304 --> 00:17:05.575
Now you'll be able to destroy
the Metarex and save the galaxy.

00:17:05.575 --> 00:17:07.510
Don't worry about me.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:09.579
Just fire the Power Cannon now.

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:10.914
[Whimpering]

00:17:10.914 --> 00:17:15.051
But if we fire the cannon,
what will happen to you?

00:17:15.051 --> 00:17:17.954
If she says not to worry,
I have to trust her.

00:17:31.534 --> 00:17:33.670
DR. EGGMAN: Tails, we
must act immediately.

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.172
Prepare to fire the
cannon at my command.

00:17:36.172 --> 00:17:36.806
Hm.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:38.808
BOTH: Hmm!

00:17:39.609 --> 00:17:41.711
Lock cannon into
place and take aim.

00:17:52.355 --> 00:17:53.289
Oh!

00:17:58.428 --> 00:18:00.363
Get ready, Sonic.

00:18:02.932 --> 00:18:04.100
Whoa!

00:18:05.969 --> 00:18:06.703
Oh.

00:18:07.871 --> 00:18:09.005
Hmm.

00:18:17.714 --> 00:18:20.617
Sonic and Shadow are
attacking together.

00:18:20.617 --> 00:18:23.219
Which means this blast
will be twice as powerful!

00:18:28.558 --> 00:18:29.926
Here goes.

00:18:30.493 --> 00:18:31.427
[Groan]

00:18:33.696 --> 00:18:37.667

[Struggling]

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.509
DR. EGGMAN: Tails, I
know this is difficult,

00:18:46.509 --> 00:18:49.846
but the galaxy is in danger
and time is running out.

00:18:49.846 --> 00:18:52.081
You must fire now.

00:18:52.081 --> 00:18:53.950
But I can't.

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:55.852
What about Cosmo?

00:18:55.852 --> 00:18:56.986
[Sniffling]

00:18:56.986 --> 00:18:58.955
She knows what she's doing.

00:18:58.955 --> 00:19:01.558
Cosmo is carrying out her destiny.

00:19:01.558 --> 00:19:06.062
She was meant to save the galaxy,
and we have to help her.

00:19:07.497 --> 00:19:08.398
Huh?

00:19:12.368 --> 00:19:14.170
But you're my friend, Cosmo.

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:16.906
I'm sorry. I just can't do it.

00:19:17.373 --> 00:19:21.244
Trust me, Tails. You have to fire.

00:19:21.778 --> 00:19:24.681
It's the only way
to save all of us.

00:19:25.448 --> 00:19:28.351
Ah... I trust you.

00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:31.254
But you mean a lot to me.

00:19:31.254 --> 00:19:33.923
I don't want to lose you, Cosmo!

00:19:36.192 --> 00:19:37.794
You won't, Tails.

00:19:38.428 --> 00:19:40.363
You'll defeat the Metarex

00:19:40.363 --> 00:19:43.566
and spread the seeds of my
clan through the galaxy.

00:19:43.566 --> 00:19:45.501
I believe in you, Cosmo.

00:19:45.501 --> 00:19:48.404
Your friendship has
meant a lot to me.

00:19:48.404 --> 00:19:50.907
I wish we could spend
more time together,

00:19:50.907 --> 00:19:52.108
but I understand

00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:56.646
this is your only hope to save the
galaxy and bring your clan back.

00:19:56.646 --> 00:19:58.615
I'm sure your seeds
will find a place

00:19:58.615 --> 00:20:00.683
to grow and build a new home.

00:20:00.683 --> 00:20:02.518
Good luck, Cosmo...

00:20:02.518 --> 00:20:03.920
And goodbye!

00:20:33.016 --> 00:20:34.951
Thank you, Tails!

00:20:34.951 --> 00:20:37.153
I'll never forget you!
