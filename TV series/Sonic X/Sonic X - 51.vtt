Looks like this story's ending.

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:12.179
But I still haven't figured
out who you really are.

You'll have to keep investigating.

in the jewelry store,

Why do you have to leave?

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:07.060
There must be another way
to solve this problem.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.996

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:40.562
[Birds chirping]

00:10:40.562 --> 00:10:42.498
Guess everybody's lookin' for us.

00:10:43.165 --> 00:10:44.767
We won't be too easy to find.

00:10:44.767 --> 00:10:46.201
It's a big planet.

00:10:47.169 --> 00:10:49.571
Yeah. We could hide
out for a long time.

00:10:50.406 --> 00:10:52.474
They might stop lookin' for us.

00:10:53.942 --> 00:10:56.578
Even... my family.

00:10:58.347 --> 00:10:59.848
Let's go!

00:11:02.484 --> 00:11:03.752
Huh.

00:11:05.921 --> 00:11:07.022
[Grunting]

00:11:07.022 --> 00:11:10.426
[Grunting with effort]

00:11:11.894 --> 00:11:15.664
[Grunting]

00:11:16.632 --> 00:11:21.837
[Grunting]

00:11:21.837 --> 00:11:22.738
Huh?

00:11:24.807 --> 00:11:26.108
Hm.

00:11:27.076 --> 00:11:28.143
[Grunting]

00:11:28.143 --> 00:11:29.645
Oof!

00:11:36.352 --> 00:11:39.855
[Panting]

00:11:39.855 --> 00:11:40.789
Huh?

00:11:40.789 --> 00:11:44.827
[Panting with effort]

00:11:44.827 --> 00:11:45.728
Huh?

00:11:46.795 --> 00:11:51.300
[Panting with effort]

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.267
Chris!

00:11:52.267 --> 00:11:53.502
Ah!

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:55.838
Here, lemme give you a hand.

00:11:55.838 --> 00:11:57.506
[Groaning]

00:11:57.506 --> 00:12:00.275
I don't need a hand!
I can do it myself!

00:12:00.275 --> 00:12:01.543
Come on!

00:12:01.543 --> 00:12:07.883
[Panting with more effort]

00:12:08.851 --> 00:12:10.119
Huh?

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:12.654
[Gasp]

00:12:12.654 --> 00:12:13.922
Oh!

00:12:13.922 --> 00:12:15.657
I've never been here before!

00:12:16.325 --> 00:12:18.560
How'd you know about this place?

00:12:22.231 --> 00:12:24.633
I don't understand what's
taking you so long.

00:12:24.633 --> 00:12:26.568
Do you have all our
choppers searching?

00:12:26.568 --> 00:12:28.003
Well, then buy some more!

00:12:28.003 --> 00:12:29.138
Call up the Air Force!

00:12:29.138 --> 00:12:30.572
Rent some of their planes, too!

00:12:30.572 --> 00:12:31.807
Put the business on hold!

00:12:31.807 --> 00:12:36.145
I want the entire company working
on this 24/7 until Chris is found!

00:12:36.145 --> 00:12:38.247
I don't care how much it costs!

00:12:38.247 --> 00:12:40.649
I just want my son found, now!

00:12:40.649 --> 00:12:42.584
Nelson, let's broadcast a message

00:12:42.584 --> 00:12:46.188
that Chris can have whatever
he wants if he comes home!

00:12:46.188 --> 00:12:48.924
Call the toy store and tell
them to send one of everything.

00:12:49.892 --> 00:12:51.827
Hey! I have a better idea!

00:12:51.827 --> 00:12:53.929
Let's buy Chris his own toy store!

00:12:53.929 --> 00:12:55.264
I hope this works!

00:12:55.264 --> 00:12:56.865
I want Chris back. [Crying]

00:12:56.865 --> 00:12:58.600
What do you think you're doing?!

00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.568
[Gasp]

00:13:03.839 --> 00:13:05.340
Put that phone down.

00:13:06.141 --> 00:13:07.009
Do it!

00:13:07.009 --> 00:13:07.910
Huh?

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:10.078
You're making a big mistake, son.

00:13:10.078 --> 00:13:13.148
You can't rely on your corporate
empire to bring your son home,

00:13:13.148 --> 00:13:15.851
because that's part of
what's driving him away!

00:13:15.851 --> 00:13:17.286
You won't convince Chris to return

00:13:17.286 --> 00:13:21.156
until you understand the reason
why he left in the first place!

00:13:21.156 --> 00:13:23.859
Now, why do you
think Chris ran off?

00:13:23.859 --> 00:13:26.028
Was it only because of Sonic?

00:13:26.595 --> 00:13:28.897
Or was Chris afraid that
when his friend left,

00:13:28.897 --> 00:13:31.433
he'd be all alone again,
like he was before?

00:13:31.433 --> 00:13:32.034
Huh?

00:13:32.034 --> 00:13:33.268
You won't get Chris back

00:13:33.268 --> 00:13:35.838
unless you prove you want
to be together as a family.

00:13:35.838 --> 00:13:37.005
But how?

00:13:37.005 --> 00:13:38.207
What should we do?

00:13:38.207 --> 00:13:40.442
We'll do anything to find him.

00:13:40.442 --> 00:13:42.978
Well, you don't have to
use fleets of helicopters,

00:13:42.978 --> 00:13:44.980
or bribe him with toys on TV.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.882
Chris wants to be found.

00:13:46.882 --> 00:13:48.417
Not by government forces,

00:13:48.417 --> 00:13:49.852
or by your employees.

00:13:49.852 --> 00:13:52.154
But by his mother and father.

00:13:52.588 --> 00:13:55.190
My guess is that Chris is
someplace where he knows

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:56.592
you can find him.

00:13:56.592 --> 00:13:59.094
Go there, before it's too late.

00:14:00.295 --> 00:14:01.263
[Gasp]

00:14:01.263 --> 00:14:02.231
Oh, Chris.

00:14:02.231 --> 00:14:05.734
[Sobbing]

00:14:10.973 --> 00:14:12.774
You know this place?

00:14:12.774 --> 00:14:14.076
Yeah.

00:14:14.076 --> 00:14:17.179
I used to come here every
summer with my mom and dad.

00:14:17.179 --> 00:14:19.047
When I was a little kid.

00:14:19.047 --> 00:14:21.750
[Struggling]

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:23.285
It's no use.

00:14:26.021 --> 00:14:28.490
One year, we just stopped coming.

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:31.593
They kept saying we'd come
back the next summer,

00:14:31.593 --> 00:14:33.495
but they were always too busy.

00:14:33.495 --> 00:14:35.030
[Grunting]

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:36.198
Huh?

00:14:36.198 --> 00:14:38.700
Heh. Looks like the chain broke.

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:39.735
Heh...

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.141
Hey, Sonic!

00:14:46.141 --> 00:14:47.576
Huh?

00:14:47.576 --> 00:14:49.745
I collected some firewood!

00:14:49.745 --> 00:14:51.013
Aah! Ah!

00:14:51.013 --> 00:14:53.649
Aah! Oof.

00:14:53.982 --> 00:14:55.951
You okay, Chris?

00:14:55.951 --> 00:14:57.219
I'm fine.

00:14:57.219 --> 00:14:58.787
Want some help?

00:14:58.787 --> 00:15:00.622
No, thanks.

00:15:00.622 --> 00:15:01.590
Huh?

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:03.525
I can do it myself.

00:15:04.226 --> 00:15:05.827
Okay.

00:15:07.996 --> 00:15:11.633
Sonic's probably mad that I
stopped him from going home.

00:15:11.633 --> 00:15:13.535
I wonder why he came with me.

00:15:13.535 --> 00:15:16.538
[Fire crackling]

00:15:18.774 --> 00:15:19.608
Sonic?

00:15:19.608 --> 00:15:20.409
Huh?

00:15:20.409 --> 00:15:24.079
You haven't said anything about
how I kept you from going home.

00:15:25.047 --> 00:15:27.416
I was waiting to hear what
<i>you</i> had to say.

00:15:30.052 --> 00:15:31.019
Sonic...

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.922
Why did you come with me?

00:15:34.957 --> 00:15:36.758
Are you gonna stay?

00:15:36.758 --> 00:15:38.160
That's up to you.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.429
Uh... Uh...

00:15:40.429 --> 00:15:44.566
So if I say I don't want
you to go back home,

00:15:44.566 --> 00:15:48.604
will you... stay here
with me... forever?

00:15:48.604 --> 00:15:51.006
I'll do whatever you tell me to do.

00:15:51.006 --> 00:15:52.174
[Gasp]

00:15:52.174 --> 00:15:54.843
You saved me when I first
came to this world.

00:15:55.844 --> 00:15:56.845
Mm.

00:15:58.246 --> 00:15:59.748
So that's it!

00:15:59.748 --> 00:16:01.717
You've been acting like
my friend all this time

00:16:01.717 --> 00:16:03.518
'cause you thought you owed me!

00:16:03.518 --> 00:16:05.053
That's not true.

00:16:05.621 --> 00:16:07.556
You felt like you <i>had</i>
to be my friend

00:16:07.556 --> 00:16:09.491
'cause I pulled you
out of that pool.

00:16:11.126 --> 00:16:12.527
Huh?

00:16:13.261 --> 00:16:15.330
A-a pool?

00:16:16.031 --> 00:16:18.834
Heh heh. Uh... oh!

00:16:18.834 --> 00:16:21.603
Aiyaiyaiyai!

00:16:21.603 --> 00:16:22.638
See ya!

00:16:36.551 --> 00:16:37.786
[Muffled sound]

00:16:38.186 --> 00:16:39.721
[Mumbling]

00:16:43.291 --> 00:16:44.192
Hm.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:49.064
Hm.

00:16:52.534 --> 00:16:53.502
Hm?

00:16:54.336 --> 00:16:55.437
Hm. Hm?

00:16:55.437 --> 00:16:58.507
[Grunting]

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:24.266
[Struggling]

00:17:24.266 --> 00:17:29.204
[Exasperated mumbling]

00:17:31.139 --> 00:17:32.841
Ooh!

00:17:37.913 --> 00:17:38.780
Oh!

00:17:47.823 --> 00:17:51.927
And you paid me back by
pretending to be my friend.

00:17:53.095 --> 00:17:54.763
No, Chris.

00:17:54.763 --> 00:17:56.798
Ya know that I really
am your friend!

00:17:57.766 --> 00:17:59.534
You are?

00:17:59.534 --> 00:18:01.970
If you need me to stay here
with you, then I will.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:03.672
You just have to decide.

00:18:03.672 --> 00:18:05.340
It's up to you.

00:18:10.345 --> 00:18:11.746
I can go home.

00:18:12.447 --> 00:18:13.715
Or stay.

00:18:13.715 --> 00:18:15.350
The decision is yours.

00:18:16.584 --> 00:18:19.821
Well... I'm not sure.

00:18:19.821 --> 00:18:22.724
I'd be happier if you
stayed in this world.

00:18:22.724 --> 00:18:25.626
If time does stop, we
could stay here forever.

00:18:25.626 --> 00:18:28.496
Our friendship would
never have to end.

00:18:28.796 --> 00:18:30.732
But Sonic...

00:18:30.732 --> 00:18:34.802
Don't stay here if it's
gonna make you unhappy.

00:18:34.802 --> 00:18:35.770
Ah.

00:18:36.738 --> 00:18:38.673
Don't worry about me.

00:18:39.607 --> 00:18:41.242
As long as there's
somewhere to run—

00:18:43.177 --> 00:18:44.612
I'll be happy!

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.949
I really wouldn't mind
stayin' here with ya.

00:18:47.949 --> 00:18:49.050
Honest!

00:18:49.617 --> 00:18:52.954
But... You can't stay here, Sonic.

00:18:52.954 --> 00:18:54.889
It wouldn't be right, would it?

00:18:55.456 --> 00:18:57.024
I can't let time stop

00:18:57.024 --> 00:18:58.960
just 'cause I don't wanna
lose your friendship.

00:18:59.594 --> 00:19:03.431
It was wrong of me to try
to keep you in this world.

00:19:03.431 --> 00:19:04.565
It's just—

00:19:05.533 --> 00:19:08.436
I wasn't ready to say goodbye yet.

00:19:08.569 --> 00:19:11.472
You've always been there
for me when I needed you.

00:19:11.472 --> 00:19:13.408
But in the end, I let you down.

00:19:13.408 --> 00:19:14.575
I'm sorry.

00:19:14.575 --> 00:19:16.544
I was just selfish.

00:19:16.544 --> 00:19:17.478
[Grunt]

00:19:18.446 --> 00:19:20.114
Please forgive me.

00:19:20.448 --> 00:19:24.318
[Crying]

00:19:24.318 --> 00:19:26.254
Hey, no tears.

00:19:26.254 --> 00:19:28.523
When you're gone,
I'll be alone again.

00:19:28.523 --> 00:19:30.725
Like I was before you came.

00:19:31.692 --> 00:19:33.628
Ever since I was little,

00:19:33.628 --> 00:19:36.497
I've been waiting for a
friend like you, Sonic.

00:19:39.333 --> 00:19:42.303
It's just so hard to say goodbye.

00:19:43.171 --> 00:19:44.839
Maybe this isn't goodbye!

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:49.510
Maybe our worlds were meant
to come together somehow!

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:50.945
If that's true,

00:19:50.945 --> 00:19:53.414
then we will see each other again.

00:19:53.414 --> 00:19:54.348
Someday.

00:19:57.185 --> 00:19:58.186
Someday.

00:19:59.654 --> 00:20:01.088
In the meantime,

00:20:01.088 --> 00:20:03.024
whenever we miss each other,

00:20:03.024 --> 00:20:04.759
we can look at the moon.

00:20:04.759 --> 00:20:06.894
It looks the same from
both worlds, ya know.

00:20:11.699 --> 00:20:14.635
[Both panting]

00:20:14.635 --> 00:20:18.372
Chris was so happy when
we came here years ago.

00:20:18.372 --> 00:20:20.541
He's here. I'm sure!

00:20:20.541 --> 00:20:23.010
I bet Chris is waiting for us!

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:25.546
And we'll have a chance to
make everything up to him now!

00:20:25.546 --> 00:20:31.486
[Both panting]

00:20:31.486 --> 00:20:32.453
Huh?

00:20:32.453 --> 00:20:32.987
Hm?

00:20:38.226 --> 00:20:39.827
[Gasp]

00:20:40.795 --> 00:20:43.498
Chris!
