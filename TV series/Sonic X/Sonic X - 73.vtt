[Stretching]

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:15.415
Hey, Tails, don't you think
it's time we took a break?

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:18.585
Well, there seems to be a problem
with the security system,

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:20.287
and I want to find out why.

00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:21.989
But you can go.

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:23.657
Don't you want help?

00:00:23.657 --> 00:00:25.492
Nah, I can handle it myself.

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:28.161
Hopefully we'll all have
plenty of time to rest up.

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.963
Since there aren't
any Metarex around,

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:31.632
things should stay pretty quiet.

00:00:31.632 --> 00:00:34.167
I sure hope you're right, Tails.

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:35.702
Me, too.

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:39.439
[Yawning]

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:07.434
Okay. That should work.

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:09.069
Now I'll restart the system.

Aaah!

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:12.573
Huh!

00:01:12.573 --> 00:01:14.241
Red alert! Red alert!

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:16.443
We have an intruder
on board the ship!

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:17.678

00:01:17.678 --> 00:01:18.645

Hold it, Shadow!

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:58.678
You mind telling me
what this is all about?

Hm.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:33.179
I woke up. Shadow was there.

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:35.248
He said something strange to me.

What's going on?

00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:19.259
CREAM: Sonic and Chris got
hurt in a fight with Shadow!

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.460
They'll be okay,

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.129
but it'll take some time
for them to recover.

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:24.097
KNUCKLES: Why were they fighting?

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:26.266
It's really confusing.

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:29.502
For some reason, Shadow was
trying to attack Cosmo.

00:04:29.502 --> 00:04:31.070
So he <i>is</i> our enemy!

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.973
Don't even think about going
after Shadow right now!

00:04:33.973 --> 00:04:36.876
Find Tails and Cosmo and
make sure they're safe.

00:04:36.876 --> 00:04:38.244
That's an order!

00:04:38.244 --> 00:04:39.846
I know what I'm doing!

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:42.982

What are you doing, Tails?

00:05:05.605 --> 00:05:07.807
If Shadow has access
to our computer,

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:10.443
he could use the internal
sensors to track us.

00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:13.346
I have to block him from
accessing the data.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.281
That should do it.

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:17.850
Hmm?

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:19.852

your own size!

[Breathing heavily]

00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:16.509
Why is Shadow against me?

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:19.112
Maybe Eggman sent him to get you.

00:06:19.112 --> 00:06:22.515
It's even possible that Shadow's
working for the Metarex.

00:06:22.515 --> 00:06:24.450
[Gasp] The Metarex?

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:27.654
Anyway, it doesn't matter
who gave him the orders.

[Gasp]

00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:30.690
Either way, Shadow
isn't going to give up

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.925
until he finishes what he started.

00:06:32.925 --> 00:06:35.662
But I don't want you
to worry, Cosmo.

00:06:35.662 --> 00:06:38.398
I promise everything will be okay.

00:06:39.365 --> 00:06:42.101
Because if Shadow
tries to hurt you,

00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:45.371
he'll have to get past me, first!

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:47.306

as temperamental as you?

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:25.845
You'll be safe once we get
away on the X Tornado.

00:07:28.081 --> 00:07:30.016
Prepare for takeoff.

00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:31.184
Hold on, Cosmo!

00:07:39.092 --> 00:07:40.660
Everything'll be okay.

00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:42.995
Aah!

00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:54.574
Hand that girl over, now.

00:07:54.574 --> 00:07:57.944
I don't wanna fight you, Tails,
but I will if I have to.

00:07:57.944 --> 00:08:00.847
Cosmo never did
anything to harm you!

00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:03.116
Why are you after her anyway?

00:08:03.116 --> 00:08:04.751
I'm not going to tell you.

00:08:04.751 --> 00:08:07.553
Now move aside, or you'll be sorry.

00:08:07.553 --> 00:08:09.388
Forget it, Shadow!

00:08:09.388 --> 00:08:11.324
I won't let you hurt Cosmo!

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:15.561
I'm warning you!

00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:16.529
Ah...

00:08:18.364 --> 00:08:20.600
This is your last chance, Tails.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.569
Give up now, or face
the consequences.

00:08:31.993 --> 00:08:34.296
Well, what are you here for?

00:08:34.296 --> 00:08:36.231
Strain your brain and guess.

00:08:36.231 --> 00:08:39.467
Are you working with Shadow
to help him attack Cosmo?

00:08:39.467 --> 00:08:42.637
Bingo. You're not as
dim-witted as you look.

00:08:42.637 --> 00:08:44.472
Why are you doing this?

00:08:44.472 --> 00:08:46.641
I'm surprised you and your
spaced-out crew mates

00:08:46.641 --> 00:08:48.610
haven't figured that
out for yourselves.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:50.879
That girl Cosmo's a real plant.

00:08:50.879 --> 00:08:52.480
In more ways than one.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.716
I'm not kidding around, Rouge!

00:08:54.716 --> 00:08:57.319
You and Shadow can
communicate, can't you?

00:08:57.319 --> 00:08:58.253
Mm-hmm.

00:08:58.253 --> 00:09:00.188
Does that make you feel jealous?

00:09:00.188 --> 00:09:02.123
Call him now!

00:09:02.123 --> 00:09:04.259
Or I'll knock that
smirk off your face!

00:09:04.259 --> 00:09:05.961
No need to be pushy.

00:09:07.896 --> 00:09:09.831
Shadow, come in.

00:09:09.831 --> 00:09:11.433
It's Rouge.

00:09:11.433 --> 00:09:13.468
ROUGE: Shadow, do you read me?

00:09:13.468 --> 00:09:14.703
Come in, Shadow.

00:09:14.703 --> 00:09:16.071
Is something wrong?

00:09:17.138 --> 00:09:19.708
Shadow, why aren't you answering?

00:09:20.175 --> 00:09:22.611
Shadow? Shadow?

It's no use. He's not responding.

00:09:27.782 --> 00:09:30.819
I hope Tails and
Cosmo are all right.

00:09:30.819 --> 00:09:34.656
Back off, Shadow, or I'll
have to stop you myself.

00:09:34.656 --> 00:09:37.525
Don't be a fool. I'm too powerful.

00:09:37.525 --> 00:09:40.028

Whoa!

00:10:02.484 --> 00:10:04.686
Something just blew
up in the hangar.

00:10:04.686 --> 00:10:07.589
I've gotta reach Tails
before it's too late!

00:10:34.883 --> 00:10:39.087
Danger alert. All stun
lasers lock on target.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.692
Here he comes!

00:10:43.692 --> 00:10:44.993
It's okay.

00:10:44.993 --> 00:10:46.327
Just trust me.

00:10:46.327 --> 00:10:47.295
Huh?

00:10:54.936 --> 00:10:55.837
[Grunt]

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:09.951

Huh?

00:11:26.367 --> 00:11:27.302
Oof!

00:11:33.608 --> 00:11:34.809
Come on, Cosmo!

Aah!

00:11:44.786 --> 00:11:46.321

00:11:50.358 --> 00:11:51.926
Get out of here, quick!

00:11:51.926 --> 00:11:56.664
[Grunting]

00:11:56.664 --> 00:11:58.900
Aaaah!

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.770
I've had enough of you, Shadow!

00:12:04.739 --> 00:12:06.274
Go! Now!

00:12:06.274 --> 00:12:08.443
Be careful, Knuckles.

00:12:10.345 --> 00:12:13.148
Trying to challenge
me is a big mistake.

00:12:13.148 --> 00:12:14.783
And you're going to regret it.

00:12:14.783 --> 00:12:17.051
I've always wanted to Shadow-box.

00:12:17.051 --> 00:12:18.319
As you wish!

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:19.921
[Grunt]

00:12:22.657 --> 00:12:23.658
Aah!

00:12:25.293 --> 00:12:26.628
Ooof!

00:12:35.036 --> 00:12:35.770
Ah!

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:37.238
It's a dead end!

00:12:37.238 --> 00:12:39.307
We have to find another way out!

00:12:39.307 --> 00:12:40.241
Aah!

00:12:40.708 --> 00:12:41.442
Aah!

00:12:41.442 --> 00:12:42.644
Come on!

00:12:42.644 --> 00:12:44.012
[Panting]

00:12:44.012 --> 00:12:46.681
Please hurry! Shadow will
catch up with us soon!

00:12:46.681 --> 00:12:48.616
Sooner than you think.

00:12:53.288 --> 00:12:55.223
Grrrr...

00:12:55.223 --> 00:12:56.558
I guess this is it.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.662
Wait a second, Shadow.

00:13:00.662 --> 00:13:02.163
If you insist on getting rid of me,

00:13:02.163 --> 00:13:04.332
you should at least
tell me the reason why.

00:13:04.332 --> 00:13:05.967
I do have a reason.

00:13:09.838 --> 00:13:12.040
But I won't tell you what it is.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:24.485
There's no point in
putting up a fight,

00:13:24.485 --> 00:13:26.554
because you can't beat me.

00:13:26.554 --> 00:13:28.423
You don't have to do this!

00:13:28.423 --> 00:13:31.826
You won't talk me out of getting
rid of you, so don't try.

00:13:31.826 --> 00:13:32.260
Ah...

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.328
Stay back!

00:13:33.328 --> 00:13:35.129
I won't let you near her!

00:13:38.533 --> 00:13:41.936
Do you seriously believe
a door can stop me?

00:13:41.936 --> 00:13:44.439
Maybe you're not as
strong as you think!

00:13:49.444 --> 00:13:51.379
This will be too easy.

00:13:53.314 --> 00:13:53.915
Huh?

00:13:53.915 --> 00:13:56.317
Huh!

00:13:58.786 --> 00:14:01.789
[Groaning]

00:14:07.028 --> 00:14:07.996
Whoa!

00:14:07.996 --> 00:14:08.496
Ah!

00:14:08.763 --> 00:14:09.464
Ah!

00:14:14.235 --> 00:14:16.237
I'll spin free!

00:14:24.312 --> 00:14:26.648
Shadow fell right into my trap!

00:14:26.648 --> 00:14:29.417
Activate Sonic Power Cannon now!

00:14:34.022 --> 00:14:35.390
[Grunting]

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:45.166
[Panting]

00:14:45.166 --> 00:14:47.135
We lucked out, Cosmo.

00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:51.005
Shadow started spinning
at just the right time.

00:14:51.005 --> 00:14:53.041
You should be safe now.

00:14:53.041 --> 00:14:54.008
Hm.

00:14:54.475 --> 00:14:55.476
Mm.

00:14:57.011 --> 00:14:57.979
Let's go.

00:15:01.049 --> 00:15:02.016
It's okay!

00:15:02.016 --> 00:15:04.018
Tails said Shadow went to space.

00:15:04.018 --> 00:15:05.386
Way to go, buddy.

00:15:05.386 --> 00:15:06.921
Where's Shadow?

00:15:06.921 --> 00:15:08.022
He's gone now.

00:15:08.022 --> 00:15:10.224
Tails was able to use
the Sonic Power Cannon

00:15:10.224 --> 00:15:12.660
to send Shadow on a long trip.

00:15:13.127 --> 00:15:15.229
And you're next!

00:15:15.229 --> 00:15:17.498
Unless you tell me what's goin' on!

00:15:17.498 --> 00:15:20.468
Your foxy friend just
made a huge mistake.

00:15:20.468 --> 00:15:23.938
Cosmo is the real
enemy, not Shadow.

00:15:23.938 --> 00:15:24.939
Hm?

00:15:25.907 --> 00:15:26.941
Hm.

00:15:36.617 --> 00:15:39.487
I'm sorry I'm causing
you so much trouble.

00:15:39.487 --> 00:15:41.990
You don't have to apologize, Cosmo.

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:43.358
You mean a lot to me,

00:15:43.358 --> 00:15:44.792
and the only thing I care about

00:15:44.792 --> 00:15:46.427
is making sure that you're safe.

00:15:50.431 --> 00:15:51.399
Hm!

00:15:58.039 --> 00:15:59.007
Aah!

00:16:05.146 --> 00:16:07.015
This Emerald is a fake!

00:16:07.015 --> 00:16:08.950
Let's settle this now!

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:10.051
[Yelling]

00:16:10.051 --> 00:16:11.052
Huh!

00:16:11.052 --> 00:16:12.153
Oof!

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.388
Uh...

00:16:13.388 --> 00:16:14.455
He's hurt.

00:16:16.391 --> 00:16:17.725
Uh!

00:16:17.725 --> 00:16:19.560
[Grunting]

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.496
Ah!

00:16:23.331 --> 00:16:24.899
What have I done?

00:16:25.366 --> 00:16:26.334
[Gasp]

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:30.938
Oh...!

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:40.845
Let's get this over with.

00:16:41.145 --> 00:16:44.849
[Quaking]

00:16:46.784 --> 00:16:47.752
Grrr!

00:16:47.752 --> 00:16:48.686
Aaah!

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:49.888
Hm?

00:16:49.888 --> 00:16:51.256
[Groaning]

00:16:54.592 --> 00:16:56.661
[Groaning]

00:16:56.661 --> 00:16:58.897
Leave her alone. [Groan]

00:16:58.897 --> 00:17:01.399
If you don't, you'll be sorry.

00:17:01.799 --> 00:17:02.767
Hm.

00:17:05.303 --> 00:17:06.104
Huh?

00:17:11.376 --> 00:17:12.310
Huh!

00:17:17.715 --> 00:17:19.384
Aah!

00:17:19.384 --> 00:17:20.485
Aaah!

00:17:20.485 --> 00:17:21.686
Oh!

00:17:21.686 --> 00:17:26.257
[Both struggling]

00:17:26.991 --> 00:17:28.259
Ah!

00:17:31.729 --> 00:17:32.830
Ah!

00:17:33.798 --> 00:17:35.166
[Whimpering]

00:17:48.846 --> 00:17:50.248
[Both gasping]

00:18:00.325 --> 00:18:02.260
Well done, Cosmo.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.796
Or should I say, White Seed.

00:18:04.796 --> 00:18:05.730
[Gasp]

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.433
You have now completed
your mission.

00:18:08.433 --> 00:18:09.400
Huh?

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.702
White Seed...

00:18:11.336 --> 00:18:12.704
Mission...

00:18:12.704 --> 00:18:14.572
What mission?

00:18:14.572 --> 00:18:16.207
What is he talking about?

00:18:26.884 --> 00:18:28.252
Aaah!

00:18:28.252 --> 00:18:30.321
Aah!

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:35.259
[Panting]

00:18:35.259 --> 00:18:36.260
Aah!

00:18:37.662 --> 00:18:39.097
It's too late.

00:18:39.097 --> 00:18:41.265
The Metarex are coming.

00:18:46.037 --> 00:18:49.941
If you want to survive,
then listen to me.

00:18:49.941 --> 00:18:52.844
Pay close attention.

00:18:52.844 --> 00:18:54.779
Don't...

00:18:54.779 --> 00:18:57.682
Don't... listen...

00:18:57.682 --> 00:19:01.519
From now on, you will
report everything to me.

00:19:01.519 --> 00:19:04.122
Your eyes will be my eyes.

00:19:04.122 --> 00:19:06.357
Your ears will be my ears.

00:19:06.357 --> 00:19:09.427
You will be the ultimate spy.

00:19:09.427 --> 00:19:12.697
Your code name will be White Seed.

00:19:13.498 --> 00:19:17.235
[Screaming]
