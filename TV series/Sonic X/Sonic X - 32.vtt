WEBVTT

00:00:03.704 --> 00:00:05.038
No way!

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:07.941
This is Chalkboard Charlie calling Homeroom.

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:10.511
Christopher Thorndyke is
still absent from school.

00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:12.446
Get the ball, Francis.

00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:13.680
Mr. Stewart?

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.481
[Sigh]

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.350
Can you throw me the ball, please?

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.585
Hey, Mr. Stewart! Why
don't you come and play?

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:19.953
Uh... me?

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:20.988
Yeah, it'll be fun!

00:00:20.988 --> 00:00:22.456
Alright.

00:00:27.928 --> 00:00:28.629
[Laughing]

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:30.097
Nothin' but net!

00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:32.466
That was an awesome shot, Mr. Stewart!

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:36.670
Well, I was an alternate on the
practice squad back in college.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.605
[Giggles]

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:41.275
Did I say something funny, Helen?

00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:44.711
I was just thinking that I'm
happy we got you as our teacher.

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:45.345
Really.

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:47.648
We weren't sure about you
at first, but you're cool.

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:49.583
Thanks, Danny.

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:53.620
I thought Tails and Sonic
would be here in the workshop.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.055
Wonder where they are?

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.425
Maybe they took the X Tornado out,

00:00:58.425 --> 00:01:00.527
and I guess I just missed 'em.

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:03.497
I can't wait to show 'em what I've got!

00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:06.033
Sonic's gonna be really proud of me

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:08.302
when he sees that I found a Chaos Emerald!

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.470
Go, go, go, go, go

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.540
Gotta go fast

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:16.510
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:22.316
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:24.384
Got ourselves a situation

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:26.420
Stuck in a new location

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.023
Without any explanation

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:32.092
No talk of relaxation

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:33.727
Don't, don't, don't

00:01:33.727 --> 00:01:35.529
Don't blink, don't think

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:37.331
Just go, go, go, go

00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:38.832
Go, go

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.371
Sonic is on the run

00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:46.273
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:49.977
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:53.647
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:01:53.647 --> 00:01:56.083
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:56.083 --> 00:01:57.985
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:01:57.985 --> 00:02:00.487
Sonic X

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:02.389
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:05.225
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:06.259
Sonic X

00:02:18.205 --> 00:02:19.906
It's Knuckles!

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.378
Eggman!

00:02:24.378 --> 00:02:25.345
Hmm.

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:27.280
What'd ya do to him?

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.216
Nothing. I found him this way.

00:02:35.022 --> 00:02:37.391
Woah! He's alive!

00:02:37.391 --> 00:02:39.426
Of course I am.

00:02:39.426 --> 00:02:40.761
What happened?

00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:42.696
Chaos turned against me.

00:02:42.696 --> 00:02:44.297
How come?

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:48.468
Because it wants to use the power of
the Chaos Emeralds all for itself.

00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:50.404
Tell us where Chaos is, or else!

00:02:50.404 --> 00:02:51.972
Take it easy, Knuckles.

00:02:51.972 --> 00:02:54.441
How dare you threaten me?

00:02:54.441 --> 00:02:58.245
I'd love to teach you a lesson,
but unfortunately, I have to fly.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.114
He's getting away!

00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:03.083
Okay, start reeling him up!

00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:04.651
The winch is jammed!

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:06.486
We can pull him up ourselves!

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:09.122
No, wait. All that weight
will burn out our motors!

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:11.792
Don't just leave me hanging
here like a salami!

00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:14.261
Try not to get agitated.
The cable could break.

00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:15.629
Just enjoy the ride!

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.064
There's no time to lose.

00:03:17.064 --> 00:03:19.800
My plans for world domination
depend on Chaos.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.202
We have to track down
that renegade right away!

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:22.803
Roger.

00:03:22.803 --> 00:03:24.738
[Yelling]

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:29.543
If Eggman was telling the truth, we
have to find Chaos fast and stop it.

00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:31.745
The second it gets ahold of
all seven Chaos Emeralds,

00:03:31.745 --> 00:03:33.647
it'll become too powerful to defeat.

00:03:33.647 --> 00:03:35.582
You're right.

00:03:36.583 --> 00:03:37.517
Woah!

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:38.485
Ahh!

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:39.986
Huh?

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:43.890
What's goin' on here?

00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:57.437
Quiet.

00:03:58.071 --> 00:03:59.372
I've been here before.

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:01.308
We're back in the past!

00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:06.780
Tikal, the clan needs those seven Emeralds.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.750
It is the only way to protect
ourselves from our enemies.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.952
But taking the Emeralds isn't the way!

00:04:11.952 --> 00:04:14.688
Please, stop! You'll regret it forever!

00:04:14.688 --> 00:04:18.358
The clan has made its choice, and
we'll seize the Emeralds now!

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:19.693
Warriors, attack!

00:04:19.693 --> 00:04:21.595
[All yelling]

00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:22.929
Stop it!

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:27.400
[Screams] [Sounds of fighting]

00:04:41.982 --> 00:04:47.387
[Grunting]

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:02.002
What is this thing?

00:05:02.002 --> 00:05:06.840
[Chanting]

00:05:07.174 --> 00:05:09.943
[Rumbling]

00:05:11.511 --> 00:05:18.018
[Yelling and screaming]

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:28.461
They're gone. All of them.

00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:29.563
Not all.

00:05:29.563 --> 00:05:30.597
Aah!

00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:32.833
Are you okay?

00:05:34.734 --> 00:05:36.303
[Whimper]

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:42.809
I knew this would end in disaster.

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:46.813
Why, Father? Why didn't you listen to me?

00:05:47.414 --> 00:05:48.548
[Struggling]

00:05:48.548 --> 00:05:49.816
Hey! Hold on!

00:05:49.816 --> 00:05:54.688
[Sparkling]

00:05:57.057 --> 00:06:00.694
You must understand. The
servers are the seven Chaos.

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:03.263
Our hearts intensify their power!

00:06:03.263 --> 00:06:05.699
The Controller serves to unify the Chaos!

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:09.703
The seven Chaos Emeralds take what is
in our hearts and turn it into power.

00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:10.704
[Gasp]

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:14.908
But if the heart that wields the Emerald
is full of nothing but anger and fear,

00:06:14.908 --> 00:06:18.712
then that power will bring pain
and destruction to the world!

00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:22.082
Oh, please! You must stop Chaos!

00:06:33.627 --> 00:06:34.828
She's gone.

00:06:34.828 --> 00:06:38.665
Knuckles, did ya understand
what she meant about Chaos?

00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:42.235
We have to stop Chaos from getting
hold of the last Emerald.

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.137
Hey, you guys! Look!

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:48.942
[Grimaces]

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:52.112
Aah!

00:06:54.047 --> 00:06:55.115
Woah!

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:57.083
Chris!

00:06:58.585 --> 00:06:59.586
Ugh! [Grunting]

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:01.655
- Aah!

00:07:01.655 --> 00:07:02.989
Hold tight, buddy!

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:03.523
Aah!

00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:05.058
Just hang on!

00:07:06.693 --> 00:07:07.894
[Yells]

00:07:09.829 --> 00:07:10.931
Aah!

00:07:14.034 --> 00:07:15.635
Aah! Aah!

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:25.912
So Chaos has all seven Emeralds now.

00:07:25.912 --> 00:07:27.314
I'm sorry, Knuckles.

00:07:27.314 --> 00:07:28.748
It's all my fault.

00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:32.619
That creature is more
powerful than all of us.

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:34.387
It can't be stopped.

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:35.822
[Groans]

00:07:35.822 --> 00:07:37.424
But we have to try!

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:47.033
Chao! Chao!

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.241
Huh?

00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:56.176
Hmm?

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:03.683
You were doin' 50 in a 35 mile-an-hour zone.

00:08:03.683 --> 00:08:06.019
But since ya did ask me for my autograph,

00:08:06.019 --> 00:08:07.887
I'll let ya off with a warning this time.

00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:12.659
Woah!

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:14.694
Must be a water main break!

00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:16.196
Let's get outta here!

00:08:16.196 --> 00:08:18.431
[Crowd panics, everyone's yelling]

00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:19.399
Weird.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:30.210
[Explosions]

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:33.213
[Crowd yelling]
SONIC: You'll be safe here. Hurry!

00:08:33.213 --> 00:08:34.180
Ugh.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.148
Aah! Aah!

00:08:35.715 --> 00:08:36.583
Woah!

00:08:44.224 --> 00:08:47.127
[Monstrous roaring]

00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:50.430
Station Square is flooded.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.932
We don't know the exact
cause of the disaster yet,

00:08:52.932 --> 00:08:55.802
but eyewitnesses reported that
something went horribly wrong

00:08:55.802 --> 00:08:57.771
in the city's water system.

00:08:57.771 --> 00:09:00.407
As you can see, there's complete devasta-

00:09:00.407 --> 00:09:01.841
Oh my!

00:09:01.841 --> 00:09:03.476
There's something down there!

00:09:03.476 --> 00:09:06.813
It appears to be some kind of... monster!

00:09:06.813 --> 00:09:09.682
Tell that pilot to fly closer to the monster!

00:09:09.682 --> 00:09:10.984
Counterattack is impossible!

00:09:10.984 --> 00:09:12.786
Our missile launchers
were caught in the flood!

00:09:12.786 --> 00:09:13.953
What about fighter jets?

00:09:13.953 --> 00:09:15.455
How many do we have in the area?

00:09:15.455 --> 00:09:17.223
Throw everything we've got at it!

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:18.892
As Commander-in-Chief, I authorize you

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:20.960
to do whatever it takes to stop that thing!

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.734
SCARLET: Much of the city is now in ruins!

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:31.137
The only good news is that
nobody has been seriously hurt.

00:09:31.137 --> 00:09:33.740
But the monster is still attacking us.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.242
What are you trying to say, Cheese, huh?

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:37.577
Chao chao chao!

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:40.113
Don't worry. That flood won't hurt you.

00:09:40.513 --> 00:09:43.416
Right. We're going up to the
mountains where it's safe.

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:45.385
Chao chao chao chao chao!

00:09:45.385 --> 00:09:46.653
What are you waiting for?

00:09:46.653 --> 00:09:48.521
We have to get out of here, fast!

00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:52.425
But we can't go yet because Mr.
Chris still hasn't come back home.

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:53.993
Where is he?

00:09:54.294 --> 00:09:56.996
We've gotta stop Chaos somehow!

00:09:56.996 --> 00:09:59.466
Faster! We don't have much time!

00:09:59.466 --> 00:10:00.733
Better hang on!

00:10:05.672 --> 00:10:07.173
If I don't get to the city fast,

00:10:07.173 --> 00:10:09.209
there won't be anything left to save!

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.211
The monster is downtown, leaving
a wave of destruction in its wake!

00:10:21.447 --> 00:10:24.083
Children, we're all moving
up the slope there!

00:10:24.083 --> 00:10:25.551
[Children yelling and crying]

00:10:25.551 --> 00:10:27.486
Roger, this is Chalkboard Charlie.

00:10:27.486 --> 00:10:30.055
We need you back here at
headquarters on the double!

00:10:30.055 --> 00:10:31.023
Hmm. Huh?

00:10:31.423 --> 00:10:33.459
[Struggling]

00:10:33.459 --> 00:10:35.294
But I can't leave my students!

00:10:35.294 --> 00:10:37.162
What? This is a direct order!

00:10:37.162 --> 00:10:39.665
Uh..! Ooooooh..!

00:10:39.665 --> 00:10:41.600
I'm sorry, I didn't copy that.

00:10:42.101 --> 00:10:43.536
Can you repeat, Homeroom?

00:10:44.503 --> 00:10:45.437
Sir?

00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:46.972
Are you the last ones?

00:10:46.972 --> 00:10:48.440
Yeah. The others went ahead.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.409
That's good. Then follow me!

00:10:50.409 --> 00:10:51.310
- Okay!
- Right!

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.811
[Panting]

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.815
I'll wait for Chris.

00:10:56.815 --> 00:10:58.617
As a former water polo champion,

00:10:58.617 --> 00:11:01.186
I can swim both of us to
safety when the flood comes.

00:11:01.186 --> 00:11:02.154
Chao chao!

00:11:02.154 --> 00:11:03.122
Alright.

00:11:03.589 --> 00:11:05.024
Chao!

00:11:07.259 --> 00:11:08.694
Hmm...

00:11:13.866 --> 00:11:17.836
[Grunting]

[Coughs]

00:11:19.004 --> 00:11:20.940
Thanks! That was close.

00:11:25.311 --> 00:11:28.314
Alright! Hope they send
that thing down the drain!

00:11:28.314 --> 00:11:30.149
Commence attack pattern Bravo.

00:11:30.149 --> 00:11:31.517
Copy that, squad leader.

00:11:31.517 --> 00:11:32.885
Let's take it down!

00:11:32.885 --> 00:11:36.855
[Lasers firing]

00:11:36.855 --> 00:11:39.091
Switch to missile fire now.

00:11:39.091 --> 00:11:40.893
[Blasting]

[Missiles whistle]

[Crowd pandemonium]

00:12:04.783 --> 00:12:06.885
The pilots are okay!

00:12:06.885 --> 00:12:07.853
We need...

00:12:07.853 --> 00:12:08.821
Sonic...

00:12:14.126 --> 00:12:15.594
Systems are go!

00:12:15.594 --> 00:12:16.762
Let's take off!

00:12:17.463 --> 00:12:20.599
A successful evil genius always has a Plan B.

00:12:20.599 --> 00:12:23.235
That's why I have the Egg Carrier 2!

00:12:23.235 --> 00:12:24.603
Chaos better watch out!

00:12:24.603 --> 00:12:27.039

[Laughs]

00:12:28.807 --> 00:12:29.775
Oof.

00:12:34.146 --> 00:12:35.581
That's it, Chaos!

00:12:35.581 --> 00:12:37.683
Your destroyin' days are over! Hyaa!

00:12:39.852 --> 00:12:41.086
Hey! Look!

00:12:41.086 --> 00:12:42.221
Aah!

00:12:44.089 --> 00:12:45.190
Oof!

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:46.158
Huh?

00:12:52.831 --> 00:12:55.567
Woooah!! Aah!

00:12:59.038 --> 00:13:00.005
Woah!

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.307
[Grunt]

00:13:02.307 --> 00:13:04.243
Sonic!

00:13:06.078 --> 00:13:07.346
Aah!

00:13:07.813 --> 00:13:08.914
You alright?

00:13:08.914 --> 00:13:10.716
Yeah. Thanks, Chris!

00:13:10.716 --> 00:13:11.884
Ya think...

00:13:11.884 --> 00:13:13.419
we'll win?

00:13:13.419 --> 00:13:15.154
It'll turn out okay.

00:13:15.154 --> 00:13:16.922
But Chaos is more powerful than ever,

00:13:16.922 --> 00:13:18.691
so I'll need plenty of help.

00:13:18.691 --> 00:13:20.592
Can I count on ya?

00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:21.627
You bet!

00:13:21.627 --> 00:13:24.129
Okay, then! Let's do it!

Back off, Sonic!

00:13:35.708 --> 00:13:37.776
Chaos double-crossed <i>me</i>!

00:13:37.776 --> 00:13:39.812
Now it's payback time!

00:13:39.812 --> 00:13:41.080
Eggman!

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.082
This time he's fighting on <i>our</i> side?

00:13:45.884 --> 00:13:48.087
All attack systems are online.

00:13:48.087 --> 00:13:51.457
Blast charges are loaded and
ready to fire at your command.

You're through, Chaos!

00:13:52.891 --> 00:13:56.628
The price of disloyalty to the
Eggman Empire is annhilation!

Oh, great! How're we gonna beat him now?

This just keeps gettin'
freakier and freakier.

You again!

00:14:40.906 --> 00:14:42.841
Since the day of my father's invasion,

00:14:42.841 --> 00:14:46.111
I've journeyed across the seas
of eternal time with Chaos

00:14:46.111 --> 00:14:48.514
to help keep its power under control.

00:14:48.514 --> 00:14:53.051
But some fiend woke Chaos with a plan
to use its power for an evil purpose.

00:14:53.051 --> 00:14:54.787
Eggman!

00:14:54.787 --> 00:14:57.756
He must've uncovered the
way to revive Chaos somehow

00:14:57.756 --> 00:15:00.159
so he could use it to take over the world!

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.837
Chaos has now drained all
the Emeralds of their power.

00:15:11.837 --> 00:15:12.871
What?

00:15:12.871 --> 00:15:15.307
Ever since my clan attacked the temple,

00:15:15.307 --> 00:15:17.709
Chaos has only known hate and anger.

00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:20.946
It will use the power of the seven
Emeralds to destroy this world.

00:15:20.946 --> 00:15:24.383
We have to seal Chaos back in the
Master Emerald before it's too late!

00:15:24.383 --> 00:15:25.751
It won't work.

00:15:25.751 --> 00:15:26.885
Huh?

00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:28.821
If we seal it in the Master Emerald,

00:15:28.821 --> 00:15:30.522
the same thing'll only happen again.

00:15:30.522 --> 00:15:32.758
We have to solve this
problem once and for all!

00:15:32.758 --> 00:15:34.693
Yes. But how can we?

00:15:35.794 --> 00:15:37.062
Oh...

00:15:40.232 --> 00:15:42.334

[Giggle] Look! I have something, for you!

00:15:47.339 --> 00:15:50.442
Cream got the Emerald back
after Chaos let them all go.

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:52.678
Hey, Sonic!

00:15:53.645 --> 00:15:54.479
Huh?

00:15:54.479 --> 00:15:58.383
I finally got back the pretty
rock that Froggy swallowed!

00:15:58.383 --> 00:16:00.986
You can borrow it if ya want to.

00:16:00.986 --> 00:16:02.754
Aww.

00:16:02.754 --> 00:16:06.892
Sonic! If you collect all the
Emeralds, you can defeat Chaos!

00:16:06.892 --> 00:16:10.329
Here, you have more experience
at being the hero.

00:16:11.063 --> 00:16:12.264
Thanks, Knuckles.

00:16:14.466 --> 00:16:15.567
Eggman?

00:16:15.567 --> 00:16:17.169
Oh, alright.

00:16:17.803 --> 00:16:18.904
Take it.

00:16:18.904 --> 00:16:20.839
We need one more.

00:16:20.839 --> 00:16:23.909

Alright!

00:16:47.833 --> 00:16:50.736
The Emeralds are getting their power back!

00:16:51.336 --> 00:16:52.304
Woah...

00:16:53.338 --> 00:16:54.306
Woah!

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.341
Woah!

Ohh!

[Gasp]

00:17:10.856 --> 00:17:12.557
I thought the power of the Emeralds

00:17:12.557 --> 00:17:14.993
could only be awakened by hate and anger!

00:17:15.661 --> 00:17:18.864
There are other feelings
that are even more powerful.

00:17:18.864 --> 00:17:21.533
When everybody gave their
Chaos Emeralds to Sonic,

00:17:21.533 --> 00:17:23.302
it was because of our friendship!

00:17:23.302 --> 00:17:24.970
Caring is stronger than hate!

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:26.804
And that's how Sonic is gonna beat Chaos!

00:17:34.579 --> 00:17:37.582

You can't stop me!

00:18:03.742 --> 00:18:04.876
Ahh!

00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:07.346
Alright!

00:18:07.346 --> 00:18:09.281
I knew Sonic could do it!

00:18:09.281 --> 00:18:11.283
I knew it! Yeah!

00:18:11.817 --> 00:18:15.020
If anybody can stop
that monster, Sonic can!

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.321
Go, Sonic!

It wasn't destroyed!

00:19:14.613 --> 00:19:15.447

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:28.393
But it doesn't look angry anymore!

00:19:28.393 --> 00:19:30.662
Yeah! If ya ask me,

00:19:30.662 --> 00:19:32.664
Chaos actually looks kinda happy!

Wow, look at all those Chao!

00:19:34.833 --> 00:19:36.468
Wonder where they came from?

00:19:36.468 --> 00:19:39.237

Chao are friends of Chaos

I think he escaped
while we were distracted.

Yeah? Well, he won't
get away next time.
