WEBVTT

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.309
Oh! This isn't the cargo hold.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.011
Oh, hi, Sonic.

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:12.746
How's it goin', Cosmo?

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:13.880
Huh?

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:19.920
[Grunt] That's the last one!

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.488
I've been meaning to ask you...

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:24.391
What's the point of having
these artificial palm trees?

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.793
It's not exactly tropical
out here in space.

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:27.894
Yeah, I know.

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:30.196
But it's all because
of your grandfather.

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:32.499
Chuck once told me that it's
important to make a ship

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:34.634
like home to keep up
the crew's morale.

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:37.537
Really? His ideas
sure are original.

00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:43.343
Hi, Amy. Watch this
stuff for me, will ya?

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:45.011
Wait, Sonic!

00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:47.581
Uh... Do you think Shadow is okay?

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:48.615
[Grunting]

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:51.518
Don't worry. He's always
making a comeback.

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:54.387
Hey! What should I
do with this stuff?

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.323
Ohh.

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:03.463
[Grunting]

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:06.900
It's lucky for us you can
control the Master Emerald.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.435
It saved the ship.

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:09.402
Chao!

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.273
Do you think that Rouge
is going to be okay?

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:14.240
Huh?

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.609
Whoa!

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.511
Who cares about that bat?

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:21.448
It serves her right for fluttering
around where she doesn't belong.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.385
I'm almost done.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:26.219
[Groaning]

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:27.454
What's wrong?

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:28.822
Just a little sore.

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:31.157
That was a tough fight.

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:33.426
The Metarex are totally relentless.

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:35.395
They keep collecting Planet Eggs.

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:37.330
I know they're transforming
them somehow,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.565
but I can't figure out why.

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:42.068
Planet Eggs and Chaos Emeralds
all have huge amounts of power.

00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:45.271
I bet the Metarex want to use that
energy to take over the galaxy.

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:47.507
How are we ever gonna defeat them?

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:49.609
Red Pine said there were
three other commanders

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.845
out there with armies of
Metarex ready to fight.

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:53.013
I don't know if we can win,

00:01:53.013 --> 00:01:55.915
but if we give up,
the galaxy is doomed.

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:58.151
How could Red Pine
have been defeated?

00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:00.820
He was almost as strong as me.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.722
What you and Red Pine
never understood

00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:05.859
is that strength must be balanced
with intelligence and skill.

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:07.827
You're far too proud of your power.

00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:09.262
Your strength is your weakness.

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:10.764
You're calling me weak?

00:02:10.764 --> 00:02:12.499
This bickering is pointless.

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.068
We should be fighting our
enemies, not each other.

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:18.538
We will not win this conflict
unless we are unified.

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:20.173
We're not fighting,

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:23.009
just having a difference
of opinion over tactics.

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:24.411
Argue if you want,

00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:26.646
but my focus will stay on our foes,

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.381
especially on Sonic.

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:31.251
He is far more dangerous
than you realize.

00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:35.121
The fact that he defeated Red
Pine is extremely disturbing.

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:37.424
I must learn the
secret of his speed,

00:02:37.424 --> 00:02:39.025
and discover his weaknesses.

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:42.529
I will not feel at ease until that
hedgehog has been eliminated.

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:44.497
I'm tired of all this talking.

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:47.701
Why don't we go find
him and fight him now?

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:50.503
I will not be intimidated
by a hedgehog.

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:53.740
He and his fellow fighters were
weakened by their recent battle.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.208
The powers at our command are

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:57.610
more than adequate to
finish off Sonic forever.

00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:00.213
Go, go, go, go, go

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:03.316
Gotta go fast

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.252
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:12.058
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:03:12.058 --> 00:03:14.127
Got ourselves a situation

00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:16.162
Stuck in a new location

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:19.766
Without any explanation

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:21.801
No talk of relaxation

00:03:21.801 --> 00:03:23.470
Don't, don't, don't

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.271
Don't blink, don't think

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:27.073
Just go, go, go, go

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:28.575
Go, go

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:34.114
Sonic is on the run

00:03:34.114 --> 00:03:36.015
Sonic, he's number one

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:39.719
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:43.423
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:45.825
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:47.727
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:50.230
Sonic X

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.165
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:54.968
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:56.002
Sonic X

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.459
[Beeping]

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.695
There's an unidentified spacecraft
directly in front of us!

00:04:09.695 --> 00:04:11.464
Have you picked up their ID code?

00:04:11.464 --> 00:04:13.566
They aren't sending any.

00:04:13.566 --> 00:04:16.535
Put a visual on the main
monitor, maximum zoom.

00:04:16.535 --> 00:04:18.104
Roger.

00:04:18.104 --> 00:04:19.538
Is it a Metarex?

00:04:19.538 --> 00:04:20.773
Chao chao!

00:04:22.508 --> 00:04:23.776
[All gasp]

00:04:23.776 --> 00:04:25.544
It's Vector.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.349
We're not sure how
it happened exactly,

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:32.284
but we got lost in space.

00:04:32.284 --> 00:04:34.220
[Laughing]

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.355
And there was no place to
stop and ask directions.

00:04:36.355 --> 00:04:40.226
You mean you've been lost since you
delivered those packages to me?

00:04:40.226 --> 00:04:41.360
But that was weeks ago!

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.996
Well, outer space is a big place.

00:04:43.996 --> 00:04:45.464
Plus, our warp engine gave out,

00:04:45.464 --> 00:04:48.067
and we didn't have any jumper
cables to restart it.

00:04:48.067 --> 00:04:49.869
You should've sent out an S.O.S.,

00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:51.137
and we would've picked
you up sooner.

00:04:51.137 --> 00:04:54.040
Our transmitter got broke thanks
to a certain bumblin' bee.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.708
It wasn't my fault.

00:04:55.708 --> 00:04:56.609
[Sigh]

00:04:56.609 --> 00:04:58.377
I can probably repair your ship,

00:04:58.377 --> 00:04:59.712
but it may take some time.

00:04:59.712 --> 00:05:02.948
And until I'm done, you'll have
to wait onboard the Blue Typhoon.

00:05:02.948 --> 00:05:05.651
While you're stayin' here,
I don't want any trouble.

00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:07.386
Okay? Captain's orders.

00:05:07.386 --> 00:05:08.421
No problem.

00:05:08.421 --> 00:05:10.356
Huh? Forget it.

00:05:10.356 --> 00:05:12.391
I'm not gonna let
you boss me around.

00:05:12.391 --> 00:05:14.326
Fine, then I won't fix your ship.

00:05:14.326 --> 00:05:15.394
Huh?

00:05:15.394 --> 00:05:16.762
Don't listen to him.

00:05:16.762 --> 00:05:19.498
I give you my word, we'll
be on our bestest behavior.

00:05:19.498 --> 00:05:21.467
And since you're making
repairs anyway,

00:05:21.467 --> 00:05:23.369
why don't you install
a multi-functional

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:25.337
auto-navigational system?

00:05:25.337 --> 00:05:27.273
That way, we can get home.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.542
[Sigh] No problem.

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:35.514
Lunch is ready!

00:05:35.514 --> 00:05:36.415
Huh?

00:05:36.415 --> 00:05:38.017
Hey, where did Chris go?

00:05:38.017 --> 00:05:41.420
He's finishing the repairs
on the Blue Typhoon for me.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.256
I've got my hands pretty
full fixing Vector's ship.

00:05:44.256 --> 00:05:46.492
We sure keep you busy, don't we?

00:05:46.492 --> 00:05:49.028
Aw, it's nothin' I can't handle.

00:05:49.028 --> 00:05:51.497
And besides, I like making repairs.

00:05:51.497 --> 00:05:52.765
Whaddaya know!

00:05:52.765 --> 00:05:54.200
What's going on, Vector?

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.603
Now I see why Tails didn't want
us around while he fixed our ship.

00:05:57.603 --> 00:05:59.605
That little fox sure is foxy!

00:05:59.605 --> 00:06:00.506
Huh?

00:06:00.506 --> 00:06:02.775
Tails has a crush
on that green girl.

00:06:02.775 --> 00:06:05.077
He got rid of us so that
he could be alone with her,

00:06:05.077 --> 00:06:07.146
and I'll bet he's gonna
ask her for a date,

00:06:07.146 --> 00:06:08.481
or invite her to take a space walk

00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:09.915
so they can gaze at the stars.

00:06:09.915 --> 00:06:12.718
I think you and the others have been
pushing yourselves too hard lately.

00:06:12.718 --> 00:06:15.554
At least we have time
to take it easy now.

00:06:15.554 --> 00:06:16.922
[Slurping]

00:06:16.922 --> 00:06:17.723
Hmm.

00:06:17.723 --> 00:06:21.527
This would probably be a good time
to spring my surprise on everybody.

00:06:21.527 --> 00:06:24.497
What kind of surprise do
you have in mind, Cosmo?

00:06:24.497 --> 00:06:26.866
I'm not going to tell you.

00:06:27.466 --> 00:06:29.034
Look at him!

00:06:29.034 --> 00:06:30.770
Tails is too shy and insecure to

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.905
tell that girl how much
he cares about her.

00:06:32.905 --> 00:06:35.241
I know exactly what
that feels like!

00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:37.843
[Crying]

00:06:37.843 --> 00:06:41.347
I think you drank too much swamp
water when you were a baby.

00:06:42.581 --> 00:06:45.084
Tails says he doesn't need
help fixing up our ship,

00:06:45.084 --> 00:06:47.019
but wandering around doing nothing

00:06:47.019 --> 00:06:49.922
while he sweats away makes
me feel like a freeloader.

00:06:49.922 --> 00:06:52.591
I've been thinking that, since
Tails is scratching our back,

00:06:52.591 --> 00:06:54.293
maybe we ought to scratch his back.

00:06:54.293 --> 00:06:55.194
It's itchy?

00:06:55.194 --> 00:06:56.695
That's just an expression!

00:06:56.695 --> 00:06:57.530
Sorry.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.331
We'll repay Tails
for what he's doing

00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:01.667
by helping him win the
heart of that green gal.

00:07:01.667 --> 00:07:04.770
We're detectives, Vector,
not matchmakers.

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.240
I've come up with a scheme I
call "Project Dame in Distress."

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.176
Here, let me tell
you how it'll work.

00:07:10.176 --> 00:07:12.344
[Whispering]

00:07:15.681 --> 00:07:16.916
[Laughter]

00:07:16.916 --> 00:07:18.818
Huh? Hey, who's there?

00:07:18.818 --> 00:07:19.718
It's me.

00:07:19.718 --> 00:07:22.288
I'm getting bored of waiting
for my ship to get fixed.

00:07:22.288 --> 00:07:24.256
Do you wanna play tag with me?

00:07:24.256 --> 00:07:25.224
Hmph.

00:07:25.224 --> 00:07:26.992
I've got more important
things to do.

00:07:26.992 --> 00:07:28.794
Pbbbbbbbft!

00:07:28.794 --> 00:07:32.498
Knuckles can't catch me!

00:07:32.498 --> 00:07:34.266
Nya-na na na na na!

00:07:34.266 --> 00:07:36.168
[Laughing]

00:07:36.168 --> 00:07:39.605
You're gonna be sorry
you said that, buzz boy!

00:07:39.605 --> 00:07:40.639
Aah!

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:41.674
Huh?

00:07:42.374 --> 00:07:43.542
Oh...

00:07:43.542 --> 00:07:44.510
Oof.

00:07:45.477 --> 00:07:47.546
[Grunt] He weighs a ton!

00:07:47.546 --> 00:07:49.081
Good work, Charmy.

00:07:49.081 --> 00:07:51.050
Now I'll take over.

00:07:52.284 --> 00:07:55.287
When I'm through, his own
mama won't recognize him.

00:07:56.956 --> 00:07:58.958
You take it from here, Espio.

00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.125
Right.

00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:07.066
I hope everybody
enjoys my surprise.

00:08:07.066 --> 00:08:07.867
Cosmo!

00:08:07.867 --> 00:08:08.968
Aah!

00:08:08.968 --> 00:08:10.269
I switched sides.

00:08:10.269 --> 00:08:12.037
I'm fighting for the Metarex now.

00:08:12.037 --> 00:08:13.038
Uhh...

00:08:13.038 --> 00:08:14.974
I'm going to take you prisoner!

00:08:15.474 --> 00:08:16.609
Gah! Ahh...

00:08:16.609 --> 00:08:18.844
Resistance is useless.

00:08:18.844 --> 00:08:21.113
The... the Metarex rule!

00:08:21.113 --> 00:08:22.047
Uhh...

00:08:22.047 --> 00:08:23.816
Growl, or something!

00:08:23.816 --> 00:08:25.117
[Both growl]

00:08:25.117 --> 00:08:26.619
[Both growl again]

00:08:27.253 --> 00:08:28.621
This is ridiculous.

00:08:28.621 --> 00:08:30.556
[Growls]

00:08:30.556 --> 00:08:34.360
[Growling]

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.096
All right! Tails to the rescue!

00:08:37.096 --> 00:08:39.064
What are you doing, Knuckles?

00:08:39.064 --> 00:08:40.366
Cosmo?

00:08:40.366 --> 00:08:41.133
[Both gasping]

00:08:41.133 --> 00:08:42.201
Don't ask me.

00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:45.237
He jumped out, said some crazy
things, and started dancing.

00:08:45.237 --> 00:08:47.106
Huh? Knuckles, why do you have

00:08:47.106 --> 00:08:48.741
makeup all over your face?

00:08:48.741 --> 00:08:49.708
Huh?

00:08:49.708 --> 00:08:50.709
[Muttering crazily]

00:08:50.709 --> 00:08:52.444
Is that ballet?

00:08:52.444 --> 00:08:53.979
I don't know.

00:08:53.979 --> 00:08:56.949
Forget it, Espio! Run for it!

00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:59.218
This isn't over yet, Cosmo!

00:08:59.818 --> 00:09:02.354
I thought Knuckles
was always serious.

00:09:02.354 --> 00:09:05.624
I didn't realize that he was
secretly a practical joker.

00:09:05.624 --> 00:09:08.093
[Giggling]

00:09:08.093 --> 00:09:08.761
Hmm.

00:09:08.761 --> 00:09:11.664
Unfortunately, I think Knuckles
came out ahead in this round.

00:09:11.664 --> 00:09:15.100
Yeah, if this keeps up, he's gonna
give Tails some competition.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.136
[Both laugh]

00:09:20.572 --> 00:09:24.109
That gravity field we fell into
really bent me out of shape!

00:09:24.109 --> 00:09:25.277
What about me?

00:09:25.277 --> 00:09:27.012
Are my dents almost gone?

00:09:27.012 --> 00:09:28.647
You never had any damage.

00:09:28.647 --> 00:09:30.849
I just enjoy striking
you with this.

00:09:30.849 --> 00:09:32.084
Hey, look at me!

00:09:33.652 --> 00:09:35.955
You peewees better
stay out of my way!

00:09:35.955 --> 00:09:37.756
How did you turn into a big shot?

00:09:37.756 --> 00:09:39.992
The gravity field must
have stretched him out.

00:09:39.992 --> 00:09:41.293
We can fix that!

00:09:41.293 --> 00:09:42.828
DECOE AND BOCOE: We'll
pound you down to size!

00:09:42.828 --> 00:09:43.729
Whoa!

00:09:43.729 --> 00:09:45.731
I like being tall!

00:09:45.731 --> 00:09:47.733
You shrimps are just jealous
'cause you'll have to

00:09:47.733 --> 00:09:49.001
look up to me from now on!

00:09:49.001 --> 00:09:51.270
Can't we settle this
on a basketball court?

00:09:56.241 --> 00:09:58.677
Well, Rouge, you got more
than you bargained for

00:09:58.677 --> 00:10:00.346
when you stowed away on my ship.

00:10:00.346 --> 00:10:02.081
That's an understatement.

00:10:02.081 --> 00:10:04.450
All I wanted was
the Chaos Emeralds.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:05.985
I suspected it all along.

00:10:05.985 --> 00:10:08.620
What happened to us, anyway?

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:10.990
It would appear we were
swallowed up by some kind of

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:14.960
gravity field, and spit back out
into an unknown part of the galaxy.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.362
You're joking, right?

00:10:16.362 --> 00:10:19.064
It may take us a little
while to get our bearings.

00:10:19.064 --> 00:10:21.633
With luck, we'll be able to
return to our own region of

00:10:21.633 --> 00:10:23.669
space without too much difficulty.

00:10:23.669 --> 00:10:24.870
I hope so.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:27.272
But what'll we do
about sleepyhead here?

00:10:27.272 --> 00:10:29.408
Shadow needs some time to recover.

00:10:29.408 --> 00:10:31.577
He's still knocked out
because he released all his

00:10:31.577 --> 00:10:34.313
energy before he transformed
into Super Shadow.

00:10:34.313 --> 00:10:36.181
And now he's completely run down.

00:10:36.181 --> 00:10:39.952
I just hope it hasn't had any
other interesting effects on him.

00:10:39.952 --> 00:10:41.553
Could he get his memory back?

00:10:41.553 --> 00:10:42.654
Maybe.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:46.525
What happened to me, Doctor?

00:10:48.093 --> 00:10:50.129
You passed out, but you're fine.

00:10:50.863 --> 00:10:53.165
Did everybody else
make it out safely?

00:10:54.033 --> 00:10:55.968
You saved us all.

00:10:55.968 --> 00:10:57.569
Thanks to that ring on your wrist,

00:10:57.569 --> 00:10:59.538
you overpowered our enemies.

00:11:01.473 --> 00:11:03.142
Really?

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:13.751
Whoa!

00:11:13.751 --> 00:11:14.619
Uh!

00:11:14.619 --> 00:11:16.120
[Gasp]

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.155
Sorry.

00:11:17.155 --> 00:11:19.090
Ah! It was my fault.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:21.359
I should have looked
where I was going.

00:11:21.859 --> 00:11:23.061
Are you okay?

00:11:23.061 --> 00:11:25.229
I'm fine, but I'm
in a bit of a hurry.

00:11:25.229 --> 00:11:27.165
I'll talk to you later, okay?

00:11:34.138 --> 00:11:35.106
Huh?

00:11:35.106 --> 00:11:38.276
Cosmo must've dropped this
when I bumped into her.

00:11:40.111 --> 00:11:42.847
Guys, my new plan's
sure to do the trick.

00:11:42.847 --> 00:11:45.216
I'm afraid to ask what
your plan entails.

00:11:45.216 --> 00:11:47.952
Well, it's still a
work in progress.

00:11:51.022 --> 00:11:51.889
Huh?

00:11:51.889 --> 00:11:54.058
[Panting]

00:11:54.058 --> 00:11:55.493
Where's he going?

00:12:04.235 --> 00:12:05.570
Cosmo!

00:12:06.237 --> 00:12:08.506
Now it won't be a surprise.

00:12:10.074 --> 00:12:12.844
Why did you decide to throw
a party for everybody?

00:12:12.844 --> 00:12:15.413
I know fighting the Metarex
can be exhausting,

00:12:15.413 --> 00:12:17.849
so I thought you all deserved
to have a little bit of fun.

00:12:17.849 --> 00:12:20.718
It's not easy to put a
party together by yourself.

00:12:20.718 --> 00:12:22.653
Why don't you let
me give you a hand?

00:12:22.653 --> 00:12:24.722
But you have to repair
Vector's ship.

00:12:24.722 --> 00:12:27.058
It wasn't in bad shape.
I'm already done.

00:12:27.058 --> 00:12:28.059
I'm all yours now.

00:12:28.059 --> 00:12:29.026
Ha!

00:12:29.026 --> 00:12:30.828
Then I'll take you
up on your offer.

00:12:30.828 --> 00:12:32.864
Great! What would
you like me to do?

00:12:32.864 --> 00:12:33.998
Let me see.

00:12:33.998 --> 00:12:36.134
Tails is doing pretty
good on his own.

00:12:36.134 --> 00:12:38.069
Then there's no need
for us to get involved.

00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:38.836
Let's go.

00:12:38.836 --> 00:12:39.937
We can't leave yet.

00:12:39.937 --> 00:12:43.174
You're completely clueless when
in comes to this stuff, Espio.

00:12:43.174 --> 00:12:45.209
This romance still
needs a little push.

00:12:45.209 --> 00:12:47.145
And since I'm naturally pushy,

00:12:47.145 --> 00:12:49.280
I'm just the one to make
sure Tails wins that girl,

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.681
game, set, and match.

00:12:50.681 --> 00:12:51.949
Ahem!

00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:53.317
Why, hello!

00:12:53.317 --> 00:12:54.185
Oh, Vector!

00:12:54.185 --> 00:12:56.053
We were passing by
when we overheard you

00:12:56.053 --> 00:12:57.755
talking about the surprise party.

00:12:57.755 --> 00:13:00.091
If you don't mind, we'd
like to help out, too.

00:13:00.091 --> 00:13:01.392
Oh, thanks a lot.

00:13:01.392 --> 00:13:03.928
I'm not so sure this
is a good idea.

00:13:03.928 --> 00:13:06.564
We're repaying you for
fixing our ship, foxy-woxy!

00:13:06.564 --> 00:13:08.766
All we ask is that you and
the missus remember to

00:13:08.766 --> 00:13:10.067
invite us to the wedding.

00:13:10.067 --> 00:13:10.902
Huh?

00:13:10.902 --> 00:13:12.770
D'oh! Never mind.

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:14.739
Seeing how Tails is so shy,

00:13:14.739 --> 00:13:16.674
I've got a hunch he
won't stay anywhere near

00:13:16.674 --> 00:13:17.808
Cosmo while he's helping her...

00:13:17.808 --> 00:13:18.776
[Gasp]

00:13:18.776 --> 00:13:19.477
Uhh!

00:13:19.477 --> 00:13:22.313
...so we're gonna stage
a bogus blackout.

00:13:22.313 --> 00:13:24.482
That's when me and Espio
will make our move

00:13:24.482 --> 00:13:26.150
and give love a helping hand.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:29.754
After Tails and that girl stand close
to each other for a few seconds,

00:13:29.754 --> 00:13:32.924
I guarantee the sparks
will really start flying!

00:13:33.524 --> 00:13:36.427
We'll call it "Project
Date in the Dark!"

00:13:37.261 --> 00:13:40.698
[Laughing]

00:13:40.698 --> 00:13:43.768
Okay, you can help us, if
you promise to back off.

00:13:48.573 --> 00:13:50.708
It's just as I suspected.

00:13:51.175 --> 00:13:52.009
Hmm!

00:13:54.512 --> 00:13:55.513
Let's move!

00:13:55.513 --> 00:13:56.347
Okay!

00:13:56.347 --> 00:13:57.315
[Gasp]

00:13:57.315 --> 00:13:59.517
Aah!

00:13:59.517 --> 00:14:00.518
Oof!

00:14:02.286 --> 00:14:03.721
[Groaning]

00:14:04.889 --> 00:14:06.991
[Moaning]

00:14:06.991 --> 00:14:08.192
Are you all right?

00:14:08.192 --> 00:14:11.028
Don't you guys know it's
dangerous to run in the dark?

00:14:11.028 --> 00:14:13.931
Even the best plan
can blow up on ya.

00:14:13.931 --> 00:14:14.899
[Groaning]

00:14:14.899 --> 00:14:17.068
[Eyes fizzle like fireworks]

00:14:18.436 --> 00:14:19.971
Are you ready to give up now?

00:14:19.971 --> 00:14:22.440
I'm just starting to get
warmed up, old buddy.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.876
No matter what it takes, I'm gonna
make sure that true love triumphs.

00:14:25.876 --> 00:14:28.579
You should let their relationship
develop naturally.

00:14:28.579 --> 00:14:31.482
My next scheme's so perfectly
plotted, it can't fail.

00:14:31.482 --> 00:14:34.285
All I need's for you to disappear!

00:14:34.285 --> 00:14:35.987
But Vector...

00:14:35.987 --> 00:14:37.321
I'll do it.

00:14:38.923 --> 00:14:40.191
Hey, Cosmo.

00:14:40.458 --> 00:14:43.361
Do you have any more
streamers for me to put up?

00:14:43.361 --> 00:14:44.462
Go!

00:14:45.429 --> 00:14:46.397
Huh?

00:14:48.532 --> 00:14:50.568
You dropped your hankie, Cosmo.

00:14:50.568 --> 00:14:51.969
But... that's not mine.

00:14:52.436 --> 00:14:54.972
Well, whoever this belongs
to really needs to drop it

00:14:54.972 --> 00:14:56.374
in the washing machine.

00:14:56.374 --> 00:14:59.277
Hey, look, something
is embroidered there.

00:14:59.277 --> 00:15:01.712
V-E-C-T-O-R.

00:15:03.014 --> 00:15:06.250
Vector, I think you'd better
have this thing disinfected.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.185
Yeah, I'll do that.

00:15:09.487 --> 00:15:11.989
I'm not gonna get involved in
any more of your hanky-panky.

00:15:11.989 --> 00:15:13.758
I can't believe how Tails keeps

00:15:13.758 --> 00:15:15.926
blowing the opportunities
I've given him.

00:15:15.926 --> 00:15:18.963
For a detective, you
certainly are clueless.

00:15:19.997 --> 00:15:21.932
It looks great, Cosmo!

00:15:21.932 --> 00:15:24.669
I never would have finished
without your help, Tails.

00:15:24.669 --> 00:15:26.304
I really owe you.

00:15:26.871 --> 00:15:28.839
You don't have to thank me, Cosmo.

00:15:28.839 --> 00:15:30.841
I like being with you.

00:15:30.841 --> 00:15:33.978
Ah! Really? Me too, Tails.

00:15:33.978 --> 00:15:35.780
It's been fun to work together.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:37.214
We make a pretty good team.

00:15:37.214 --> 00:15:38.449
Don't you think so?

00:15:39.083 --> 00:15:40.418
I agree!

00:15:40.418 --> 00:15:42.019
Well, Vector,

00:15:42.019 --> 00:15:44.455
I'd say there's no need for
you to turn up the heat...

00:15:44.455 --> 00:15:46.223
unless you want to
get burned again.

00:15:46.223 --> 00:15:50.127
I guess it's true being a love detective
ain't exactly my speciality.

00:15:50.127 --> 00:15:53.264
So our matchmaking mission
is finally over, Vector?

00:15:53.264 --> 00:15:54.765
Not yet, Charmy.

00:15:54.765 --> 00:15:58.169
Those two squares still need
to learn how to have a ball!

00:15:58.169 --> 00:15:58.869
[Grunt]

00:15:58.869 --> 00:15:59.837
Huh?

00:16:01.205 --> 00:16:02.173
Aaah!

00:16:05.211 --> 00:16:06.179
Aaah!

00:16:06.179 --> 00:16:07.247
Cosmo!

00:16:07.247 --> 00:16:08.515
[Clattering]

00:16:08.515 --> 00:16:09.349
Ah!

00:16:12.352 --> 00:16:13.420
Huh?

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.789
You weren't hurt, were you, Cosmo?

00:16:15.789 --> 00:16:16.790
[Gasp]

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:18.892
I'm fine, Tails... thanks to you.

00:16:18.892 --> 00:16:20.360
Ahh...

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.628
Huh?

00:16:21.628 --> 00:16:22.595
Sorry.

00:16:22.595 --> 00:16:24.764
Oh. That's okay.

00:16:27.734 --> 00:16:29.803
Don't you have something
better to do?

00:16:29.803 --> 00:16:31.871
ALL: No, not really.

00:16:36.976 --> 00:16:38.478
[Laughing]

00:16:38.945 --> 00:16:41.614
You looked like you
could use a lift.

00:16:42.916 --> 00:16:45.452
It's lucky for me
you know how to fly.

00:16:45.452 --> 00:16:46.753
I've been thinking...

00:16:46.753 --> 00:16:47.954
What is it?

00:16:47.954 --> 00:16:51.958
Uh, maybe... we could
do this more often.

00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:54.961
Their relationship's taking off.

00:16:54.961 --> 00:16:56.262
Time to party!

00:16:56.262 --> 00:16:56.896
[Laughing]

00:16:56.896 --> 00:16:59.799
Whoa! Wait 'til the
others see this!

00:17:00.967 --> 00:17:02.469
It's amazing.

00:17:02.469 --> 00:17:05.438
Now we have to figure out how
to get everybody in here.

00:17:05.438 --> 00:17:07.006
What'll we do?

00:17:07.006 --> 00:17:09.609
We'll bring all your guests
to your surprise party,

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:12.812
courtesy of the Chaotix
Detective Agency!

00:17:12.812 --> 00:17:14.080
Huh!

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.916
Let me see, how can we get
the crew to the party?

00:17:16.916 --> 00:17:19.319
For starters, we could
promise you won't be there.

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:20.720
Ah!

00:17:21.955 --> 00:17:24.591
[Grumbling] If I ever run
into those clowns again...!

00:17:24.591 --> 00:17:26.092
Huh? Ah!

00:17:26.726 --> 00:17:27.961
Aah!

00:17:27.961 --> 00:17:29.662
You messed up my face!

00:17:29.662 --> 00:17:31.965
Grr! And now I'm gonna
return the favor!

00:17:31.965 --> 00:17:33.967
Hold on. I can explain!

00:17:33.967 --> 00:17:34.834
Grr!

00:17:34.834 --> 00:17:36.769
[All yelling] Let's go!

00:17:36.769 --> 00:17:38.037
Get back here!

00:17:38.037 --> 00:17:40.673
[All yelling]

00:17:40.673 --> 00:17:41.941
Grr!

00:17:44.844 --> 00:17:46.312
It's payback time!

00:17:46.312 --> 00:17:49.115
[All yelling]

00:17:49.782 --> 00:17:51.518
Huh!

00:17:51.885 --> 00:17:52.852
Ha!

00:17:53.853 --> 00:17:55.154
Huh!

00:17:55.455 --> 00:17:57.957
What have you guys
been doing in here?

00:17:58.925 --> 00:18:01.828
Cosmo wanted to do
something special for us,

00:18:01.828 --> 00:18:04.697
so she was gonna throw
us a surprise party.

00:18:04.697 --> 00:18:06.633
I guess it's off now.

00:18:06.633 --> 00:18:07.734
Whoops.

00:18:07.734 --> 00:18:08.902
Hmm...

00:18:08.902 --> 00:18:10.970
Do you have to cancel the party?

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:11.938
Hmm?

00:18:11.938 --> 00:18:13.506
Of course you don't.

00:18:13.506 --> 00:18:16.809
We don't need any fancy
decorations to have a good time.

00:18:16.809 --> 00:18:19.512
All that matters is we're together.

00:18:20.914 --> 00:18:22.015
Right, Sonic.

00:18:22.015 --> 00:18:23.950
Thanks for the party.

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:26.119
Great. She likes Sonic now.

00:18:26.119 --> 00:18:27.487
It's back to square one.

00:18:27.487 --> 00:18:28.588
[Chuckling]

00:18:30.156 --> 00:18:32.725
[Snoring]

00:18:32.725 --> 00:18:33.393
Hmm.

00:18:33.393 --> 00:18:35.328
[Giggling]

00:18:35.328 --> 00:18:37.564
Well, Sonic, what do you think?

00:18:37.564 --> 00:18:39.666
Do you like my party dress?

00:18:39.666 --> 00:18:41.601
You look gorgeous, Amy!

00:18:41.601 --> 00:18:42.402
Chao chao!

00:18:42.402 --> 00:18:44.537
I wore this dress just for you.

00:18:45.038 --> 00:18:47.440
Now you can tell me
how pretty I look.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.207
Ahh...

00:18:48.207 --> 00:18:49.542
I know.

00:18:49.542 --> 00:18:51.311
You're too stunned for words.

00:18:51.311 --> 00:18:53.646
So there I was, flushed
down the sewer,

00:18:53.646 --> 00:18:57.116
and with no hope of escape except
for my superior brainpower.

00:18:57.116 --> 00:18:59.552
[Both grunt]

00:18:59.552 --> 00:19:02.589
[All laugh]

00:19:05.658 --> 00:19:06.659
Cosmo?

00:19:06.659 --> 00:19:08.962
Huh? Hi, Tails.

00:19:08.962 --> 00:19:10.897
It wasn't quite what we expected,

00:19:10.897 --> 00:19:12.332
but the party turned out great.

00:19:12.332 --> 00:19:14.534
I'm glad everybody is
having a good time.

00:19:14.534 --> 00:19:16.235
Oh, yeah.

00:19:16.235 --> 00:19:17.036
Here.

00:19:17.036 --> 00:19:18.137
Huh?

00:19:18.538 --> 00:19:20.073
You dropped this before.

00:19:20.073 --> 00:19:21.441
I polished it up for ya.

00:19:22.542 --> 00:19:23.543
[Gasp]

00:19:23.543 --> 00:19:24.744
I hope you don't mind.

00:19:24.744 --> 00:19:26.813
I think it's just wonderful.

00:19:26.813 --> 00:19:28.081
Thank you so much.

00:19:28.081 --> 00:19:30.516
I was hoping it would
make you happy.

00:19:32.051 --> 00:19:33.953
Cosmo certainly is special.

00:19:33.953 --> 00:19:36.489
I only wish I could
tell her how I feel.

00:19:36.489 --> 00:19:38.658
You're so beauti--
[Yelp nervously]

00:19:38.658 --> 00:19:40.960
It's true... The
stars are beautiful.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.295
I'm so happy right now.

00:19:42.295 --> 00:19:45.565
I feel like I could stand
here staring at them forever.

00:19:45.565 --> 00:19:46.933
So do I.

00:19:46.933 --> 00:19:48.468
[Chuckling]
