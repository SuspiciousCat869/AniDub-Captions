00:00:00.467 --> 00:00:01.768
Last time on Sonic X,

00:00:01.768 --> 00:00:05.138
a case of mistaken identity set
our speedy hero on the run.

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:07.808
His trouble doubled when a
robber ripped off an Emerald

00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:10.244
and cameras showed a
hedgehog making the heist.

00:00:10.244 --> 00:00:12.679
As the Project Shadow
investigation continued,

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.748
Sonic made a shocking discovery.

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:18.886
Sonic and Shadow went head-to-head in
a brutal battle with a chaotic finish.

00:00:18.886 --> 00:00:20.487
Trapped by government forces,

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:23.357
Sonic surrendered and was
taken to Prison Island!

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:25.192
Will his friends find a way to free him?

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:27.528
Or will Sonic be locked away forever?

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:29.730
Find out next on Sonic X!

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.765
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:34.835
Gotta go fast

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.771
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:43.610
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.646
Got ourselves a situation

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:47.714
Stuck in a new location

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:51.318
Without any explanation

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.387
No talk of relaxation

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.022
Don't, don't, don't

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:56.823
Don't blink, don't think

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:58.625
Just go, go, go, go

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.127
Go, go

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:05.666
Sonic is on the run

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.534
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:11.271
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:14.942
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:17.377
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:19.279
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:21.782
Sonic X

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:23.684
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.520
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.554
Sonic X

00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:43.004
GUARD: Sonic's in the
underwater isolation cell!

00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:44.906
It's impossible to escape from there,

00:01:44.906 --> 00:01:48.209
and even if he could, where's
he gonna go once he breaks out?

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:50.278
Prison Island is surrounded by the sea.

00:01:50.278 --> 00:01:51.546
There's no land for miles,

00:01:51.546 --> 00:01:54.048
and everybody knows that
Sonic ain't no swimmer.

00:01:54.048 --> 00:01:58.253
We got guards keeping lookout
in the towers 24 hours a day.

00:01:58.253 --> 00:02:02.724
And the laser alarms will go off the second
they detect the slightest movement.

00:02:02.724 --> 00:02:05.326
The entire prison is wired
with surveillance cameras,

00:02:05.326 --> 00:02:07.362
metal detectors, and sound monitors.

00:02:07.362 --> 00:02:10.098
Not even a fly could escape from here!

00:02:10.098 --> 00:02:13.001
This place was built to hold the
toughest crooks in the world!

00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:15.903
But in the all the years that
Prison Island's been in business,

00:02:15.903 --> 00:02:18.373
there hasn't been one
single solitary breakout.

00:02:18.373 --> 00:02:20.975
Hope Sonic likes it here,
cuz he ain't leavin'!

00:02:20.975 --> 00:02:22.844
[Laughs]

00:02:22.844 --> 00:02:25.880
Don't think of pulling any
funny stuff while I'm on duty.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.182
Cuz I've got my eye on you, Sonic.

00:02:28.182 --> 00:02:29.651
[Laughs]

00:02:29.651 --> 00:02:31.486
GUARD 2: I'm sure Sonic is innocent.

00:02:31.486 --> 00:02:33.454
But there's nothing I can do to help him.

00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:36.357
Oh, well. If I can't get out of here,

00:02:36.357 --> 00:02:38.426
I might as well kick back and relax.

00:02:46.434 --> 00:02:48.736
We are still quite far from Prison Island,

00:02:48.736 --> 00:02:51.906
but we can't take this motorboat in
any closer because of their radar.

00:02:51.906 --> 00:02:54.208
Their security systems are so advanced,

00:02:54.208 --> 00:02:56.744
that they would spot us long
before we reached the coast.

00:02:56.744 --> 00:02:58.012
And if they do detect us,

00:02:58.012 --> 00:03:01.049
they would send out armed boats
to intercept and arrest us.

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.750
So, what are we gonna do?

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.320
Luckily, I've thought up a
way to thwart their system.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.424
It is high-tech, so we will fool
it using my low-tech solution.

00:03:12.427 --> 00:03:14.362
They'll be looking for motorboats,

00:03:14.362 --> 00:03:17.265
but this paddle boat will let
us duck under their radar.

00:03:17.265 --> 00:03:18.466
Hmm.

00:03:18.466 --> 00:03:23.471
[Panting]

00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:25.373
I don't know about this, Mr. Tanaka.

00:03:25.373 --> 00:03:27.308
I feel kind of goofy.

00:03:27.308 --> 00:03:29.677
We can make it. We just
have to paddle faster.

00:03:29.677 --> 00:03:31.179
[Panting increases]

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:32.914
Haa!

00:03:36.184 --> 00:03:38.686
Sir, somebody is heading toward the island.

00:03:38.686 --> 00:03:39.687
Really?

00:03:39.687 --> 00:03:42.457
It looks like a giant... duck, sir.

00:03:42.457 --> 00:03:44.525
That's no bird. It's a boat!

00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:47.462
Somebody's tryin' to sneak onto the island!

00:03:47.462 --> 00:03:48.963
They think they fooled us,

00:03:48.963 --> 00:03:52.467
but I'll make sure they're
sunk before they reach land.

00:03:52.467 --> 00:03:56.104
Do you really think a paddleboat
poses that much of a threat?

00:03:56.104 --> 00:03:57.271
Who knows?

00:03:57.271 --> 00:04:00.208
It's better to destroy 'em
first and ask questions later.

00:04:01.976 --> 00:04:03.711
[Cackling]

00:04:03.711 --> 00:04:05.646
What!

00:04:06.214 --> 00:04:07.181
Sound the alarm!

00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:08.149
We can't, sir.

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:09.117
The system's going haywire!

00:04:09.117 --> 00:04:10.084
Call the cell blocks!

00:04:10.084 --> 00:04:11.419
They're jamming our communications!

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:12.186
It's an attack!

00:04:12.186 --> 00:04:14.222
Ooh hoo hoo hoo hoo!

00:04:14.222 --> 00:04:16.924
He did it! He's back on Prison Island!

00:04:16.924 --> 00:04:18.292
Dr. Eggman rules!

00:04:18.292 --> 00:04:19.627
Alright!

00:04:19.627 --> 00:04:20.695
[Both laugh]

00:04:25.299 --> 00:04:27.235
I wonder if I'm pushing my luck,

00:04:27.235 --> 00:04:29.170
breaking into the place a second time.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.538
Perhaps.

00:04:30.538 --> 00:04:33.908
The security on the island has been
upgraded since your last visit.

00:04:33.908 --> 00:04:35.343
You must be careful.

00:04:35.343 --> 00:04:36.878
When they restore communications,

00:04:36.878 --> 00:04:39.213
they will send robots to stop your team.

00:04:39.213 --> 00:04:41.716
Their robotic designs are greatly improved.

00:04:41.716 --> 00:04:43.084
With their new defenses,

00:04:43.084 --> 00:04:45.520
it will be almost impossible
to enter that compound again.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.055
Well, nothing is going to
stop me from breaking in

00:04:48.055 --> 00:04:49.891
and taking those Chaos Emeralds.

00:04:49.891 --> 00:04:52.326
Shadow said I need to
obtain all seven Emeralds

00:04:52.326 --> 00:04:54.729
in order to operate the Eclipse Cannon.

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.064
But are you sure it's worth the risk, Doctor?

00:04:57.064 --> 00:04:58.032
[Evil chuckle]

00:04:58.032 --> 00:04:59.967
Once I get that cannon working,

00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:01.469
I'll be unstoppable!

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:02.170
[Evil laugh]

00:05:02.737 --> 00:05:04.472
Okay, Eggy, fill 'em in.

00:05:04.472 --> 00:05:05.506
According to Rouge,

00:05:05.506 --> 00:05:08.409
the Chaos Emeralds are stored
in a vault inside the compound.

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:10.011
I must have them.

00:05:10.978 --> 00:05:13.514
No problem. Just leave it to me.

00:05:13.915 --> 00:05:15.249
Do not trust her!

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:16.717
She wants it for herself!

00:05:17.752 --> 00:05:19.687
They get on my nerves.

00:05:19.687 --> 00:05:22.623
Let's get down to the nitty-gritty, shall we?

00:05:22.623 --> 00:05:24.525
In the first phase of my plan,

00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:26.260
I'll go around the island wreaking havoc

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.895
and drawing the guards from their posts,

00:05:27.895 --> 00:05:30.364
clearing the way for you
two to enter the compound.

00:05:30.364 --> 00:05:32.233
Then, Shadow moves in.

00:05:32.233 --> 00:05:35.069
He'll blow up the whole island by
sneaking into the weapons center

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:37.271
and setting off all the
ammunitions stored there

00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:39.474
with this miniature detonation device.

00:05:44.212 --> 00:05:46.681
Meanwhile, Rouge will
proceed to the warehouse

00:05:46.681 --> 00:05:48.316
where the Chaos Emeralds are locked away,

00:05:48.316 --> 00:05:49.851
and remove them.

00:05:49.851 --> 00:05:51.486
We will then meet up at the rendezvous point

00:05:51.486 --> 00:05:53.254
and make our escape.

00:05:53.254 --> 00:05:55.223
We have exactly 30 minutes.

00:05:55.223 --> 00:05:56.491
If you run into trouble,

00:05:56.491 --> 00:05:58.426
you're on your own.

00:05:58.426 --> 00:05:59.393
Let's go!

00:06:00.928 --> 00:06:07.368
[Explosions]

00:06:08.703 --> 00:06:10.771
[Missiles firing]

00:06:10.771 --> 00:06:12.106
[Lasers blasting]

00:06:12.106 --> 00:06:19.647
[Explosions]

00:06:22.483 --> 00:06:25.486
[Lasers firing]

00:06:25.486 --> 00:06:27.421
[Evil laughter]

00:06:27.421 --> 00:06:29.824
Peek-a-boo! [Laughter]

00:06:31.726 --> 00:06:32.927
[Explosion]

00:06:32.927 --> 00:06:35.229
[Lasers firing]

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:36.497
[Explosions]

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:50.278
What's goin' on?

00:06:50.278 --> 00:06:52.213
It looks like somebody's fighting.

00:06:52.213 --> 00:06:54.582
We better get down there and find Sonic!

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.923
Ah! [Giggling]

00:07:01.923 --> 00:07:04.492
Oh, Sonic. What a relief!

00:07:05.426 --> 00:07:06.727
I came here to rescue you,

00:07:06.727 --> 00:07:08.362
but you escaped all by yourself!

00:07:10.264 --> 00:07:11.566
Sonic?

00:07:12.233 --> 00:07:13.067
[Gasp]

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:16.571
Huh?

00:07:16.571 --> 00:07:18.072
[Gasping]

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.408
You're not Sonic!

00:07:20.408 --> 00:07:21.943
Who are you?

00:07:21.943 --> 00:07:23.578
None of your business!

00:07:23.578 --> 00:07:25.212
Now get lost!

00:07:25.212 --> 00:07:26.614
Dr. Eggman!

00:07:26.614 --> 00:07:27.582
[Gasp]

00:07:28.115 --> 00:07:29.850
Shadow! Rouge!

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.986
Carry out your assignments!

00:07:35.122 --> 00:07:37.091
I'll take care of you.

00:07:37.091 --> 00:07:38.159
Keep away!

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:39.594
Amy!

00:07:51.238 --> 00:07:54.709
I can't rescue Sonic 'til I
get Dr. Eggman out of the way.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.180
This will send Tails into a tailspin!

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:05.553
[Missiles firing]

00:08:05.553 --> 00:08:10.491
[Grunting]

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.466
He looks almost exactly like Sonic!

00:08:18.466 --> 00:08:20.101
I wonder what he's doing here?

00:08:20.701 --> 00:08:22.036
Don't worry, Sonic!

00:08:22.036 --> 00:08:23.838
I'll find you! [Grunt]

00:08:31.078 --> 00:08:33.080
Shadow will speed through the building

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.316
and sabotage the weapons center.

00:08:35.816 --> 00:08:38.919
Meanwhile, Rouge will
sneak into the warehouse.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:42.023
Once she gets in, she will
grab the Chaos Emeralds.

00:08:54.735 --> 00:08:55.770
[Gasp]

00:08:56.904 --> 00:08:59.140
I can feel those Emeralds here.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.309
All I have to do is break into
the vault and help myself.

00:09:03.277 --> 00:09:04.245
Ah!

00:09:04.245 --> 00:09:06.847
Crackin' the code'll be a cinch.

00:09:11.052 --> 00:09:17.625
[Labored breathing]

00:09:17.625 --> 00:09:19.193
[Explosions]

00:09:19.193 --> 00:09:23.998
[Lasers firing]

00:09:23.998 --> 00:09:25.299
Take this!

00:09:25.299 --> 00:09:28.202
He'll see. Tails can't outfox me!

00:09:28.202 --> 00:09:30.271
Hey, Dr. Eggman, forget him!

00:09:30.271 --> 00:09:32.173
You have more important things to do!

00:09:32.173 --> 00:09:33.507
Stay focused!

00:09:33.507 --> 00:09:35.743
I'll have to cross Tails another day.

00:09:37.478 --> 00:09:39.447
[Yelling]

00:09:41.449 --> 00:09:42.516
Now look, Tails.

00:09:42.516 --> 00:09:44.785
Just because I'm leaving,
doesn't mean you win.

00:09:44.785 --> 00:09:48.222
This is only a time out,
you hear me? A time out!

00:09:52.727 --> 00:09:53.928
Huh?

00:10:01.836 --> 00:10:02.970
Amy!

00:10:03.738 --> 00:10:04.939
Where'd she go?

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.877
I have to see what Shadow
and Rouge are up to.

00:10:14.515 --> 00:10:17.084
Don't worry. I'll be out
before you know it, buddy.

00:10:17.585 --> 00:10:19.086
Sonic...

00:10:38.439 --> 00:10:39.607
Ah ha!

00:10:44.726 --> 00:10:46.528
Doctor, the detonator is ready to go,

00:10:46.528 --> 00:10:49.064
but I need to know how
long to set the timer for.

00:10:49.064 --> 00:10:50.999
DR. EGGMAN: Good work, Shadow.

00:10:51.567 --> 00:10:54.803
You can set the detonator to
go off in exactly 15 minutes.

00:10:54.803 --> 00:10:56.939
Will that be enough time for you, Rouge?

00:10:56.939 --> 00:10:59.274
I can be out of here in five minutes, easy.

00:10:59.274 --> 00:11:02.177
DR. EGGMAN: Alright, then. Set
the detonator for ten minutes!

00:11:02.578 --> 00:11:03.812
Right, Doctor.

00:11:09.051 --> 00:11:10.452
Woah!

00:11:17.759 --> 00:11:19.328
Bet you're surprised here to see me!

00:11:19.328 --> 00:11:22.231
I rushed here to rescue you
from this awful island.

00:11:22.231 --> 00:11:23.432
Ya ready?

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:28.170
SECURITY: Intruder alert. Intruder alert.

00:11:31.173 --> 00:11:34.743
GUARD: Gold Beetle! Go bug those bozos!

00:11:34.743 --> 00:11:37.012
Flying Dog! Sniff 'em out!

00:11:40.015 --> 00:11:40.983
[Laughs]

00:11:40.983 --> 00:11:43.719
Flying Dog is the ultimate security robot.

00:11:43.719 --> 00:11:46.355
Specially designed to fetch any trespasser!

00:11:46.989 --> 00:11:49.858
Flying Dog will keep hounding
its prey until it's cornered.

00:11:49.858 --> 00:11:51.393
And then it pounces,

00:11:51.393 --> 00:11:54.263
decimating its foe with rabid ferocity!

00:11:54.263 --> 00:11:56.498
But every trespasser
isn't dangerous, ya know?

00:11:57.099 --> 00:12:01.336
My motto is, "Take no prisoners! We
have too many inmates here already!"

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:04.006
[Laughing]

00:12:05.874 --> 00:12:07.576
I'll open your cell now.

00:12:07.576 --> 00:12:09.177
You'd better step back, Sonic.

00:12:09.177 --> 00:12:10.913
I wouldn't want you to get injured.

00:12:10.913 --> 00:12:13.482
I don't know, Amy. These
bars are pretty strong.

00:12:13.482 --> 00:12:15.951
Well, I happen to be pretty and strong, too!

00:12:17.586 --> 00:12:19.021
Amy! Look out!

00:12:19.021 --> 00:12:20.022
[Gasp]

00:12:22.991 --> 00:12:25.894
Don't you know it's rude to
show up some place uninvited?

00:12:26.662 --> 00:12:29.765
And don't bother me when
I'm trying to rescue Sonic!

00:12:30.299 --> 00:12:32.668
Amy! That was great!

00:12:32.668 --> 00:12:35.137
Now I'm gonna bash down the
bars of your cell, Sonic!

00:12:35.137 --> 00:12:37.072
No, Amy! You can't do that!

00:12:37.072 --> 00:12:38.340
Don't worry, Sonic.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:41.576
My feelings for you will give
me the strength to free you!

00:12:41.576 --> 00:12:44.813
But Amy, I let them drag me
to Prison Island on purpose

00:12:44.813 --> 00:12:47.382
so that I could learn something
about my look-alike.

00:12:47.382 --> 00:12:48.583
Your look-alike?

00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:51.553
[Gasp]

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.556
You mean that creepy
hedgehog I thought was you?

00:12:54.556 --> 00:12:55.924
Did ya see him?

00:12:55.924 --> 00:12:57.826
Do ya know where he is now, Amy?

00:12:57.826 --> 00:12:59.394
You really wanna know?

00:12:59.394 --> 00:13:00.562
Yes, I do!

00:13:00.562 --> 00:13:01.930
If I tell you,

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.433
will you finally take me
out to do something fun?

00:13:04.433 --> 00:13:05.968
I don't have to!

00:13:05.968 --> 00:13:07.302
Hmph! Why not?

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:10.105
What could be more fun than this?

00:13:10.105 --> 00:13:13.141
My idea of fun is more like
going out to have a pizza,

00:13:13.141 --> 00:13:15.077
or seeing a movie together.

00:13:15.077 --> 00:13:16.478
But, since I like you,

00:13:16.478 --> 00:13:18.380
I'll tell you that when
Tails and I landed here,

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.349
we saw a red and black
hedgehog near the entrance

00:13:20.349 --> 00:13:21.883
being ordered around by Eggman.

00:13:21.883 --> 00:13:25.754
I should've figured that Eggman
would be involved in this mess!

00:13:26.888 --> 00:13:29.091
Have you been doing math on your wall?

00:13:29.091 --> 00:13:30.592
That was there before.

00:13:30.592 --> 00:13:32.327
Watch out, here I come!

00:13:34.763 --> 00:13:38.633
I'm gonna need you to help hammer
our way out of this prison, Amy.

00:13:38.633 --> 00:13:39.534
Let's go!

00:13:39.735 --> 00:13:41.470
[Hammering]

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:43.405
[Thud]

00:13:43.405 --> 00:13:45.073
Not bad, Amy.

00:13:45.073 --> 00:13:46.808
[Giggling]

00:13:46.808 --> 00:13:48.076
Sonic's out!

00:13:48.076 --> 00:13:52.414
[Alarms sound]

00:13:52.414 --> 00:13:54.583
[Groan] Now what?

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:57.019
It is too dangerous.

00:13:57.019 --> 00:13:59.087
You stay here, and I will find Sonic.

00:14:00.989 --> 00:14:02.224
Sorry, Mr. Tanaka.

00:14:02.224 --> 00:14:05.260
I can't stay behind if Sonic's in danger.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.295
[Struggling]

00:14:07.295 --> 00:14:13.035
[Screaming]

00:14:14.336 --> 00:14:15.971
I'm relieved to see you're safe, Sonic,

00:14:15.971 --> 00:14:17.739
and Mr. Chris will be, too.

00:14:17.739 --> 00:14:18.874
Shall we go?

00:14:18.874 --> 00:14:21.243
Hi Tanaka! Long time no see!

00:14:21.243 --> 00:14:23.078
How's everything going with Chris?

00:14:23.078 --> 00:14:26.081
Can't we catch up on how our
friends are doing later, Amy?

00:14:26.081 --> 00:14:28.216
He's right! You guys get moving.

00:14:28.216 --> 00:14:30.786
I still have to track down my look-alike.

00:14:30.786 --> 00:14:31.753
Oof!

00:14:34.022 --> 00:14:35.524
But I wanna go with you!

00:14:38.894 --> 00:14:40.095
Lovely!

00:14:42.664 --> 00:14:44.099
Hello there!

00:14:44.099 --> 00:14:46.668
I hope you didn't come here
to get my Emeralds back.

00:14:46.668 --> 00:14:47.636
ROBOT: Intruder located.

00:14:47.636 --> 00:14:49.571
Security units, proceed to Level 5.

00:14:49.571 --> 00:14:51.506
Prepare to attack.

00:14:51.506 --> 00:14:52.474
Halt.

00:14:57.679 --> 00:14:59.014
Oof!

00:15:06.054 --> 00:15:08.423
[Beeping]

00:15:10.926 --> 00:15:11.893
Woah.

00:15:11.893 --> 00:15:12.694
[Grunt]

00:15:18.633 --> 00:15:20.502
Shadow? This is it.

00:15:20.502 --> 00:15:21.703
I want answers.

00:15:21.703 --> 00:15:23.505
Who are ya? And what are you up to?

00:15:23.505 --> 00:15:25.006
You'll find out.

00:15:25.474 --> 00:15:29.344
[Sounds of fighting]

00:15:29.344 --> 00:15:30.378
Woah!

00:15:30.378 --> 00:15:34.416
[Sounds of fighting]

00:15:49.097 --> 00:15:50.065
[Sigh]

00:15:50.065 --> 00:15:53.135
And just when things were going so well.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:57.072
[Beeping]

00:15:57.672 --> 00:15:58.607
GUARD: Red alert!

00:15:58.607 --> 00:16:02.110
An explosive device has been
detected in the security area!

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:04.713
Begin emergency evacuation immediately!

00:16:04.713 --> 00:16:07.282
Repeat- begin emergency evacuation!

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:12.287
Mr. Chris! Where are you?

00:16:12.287 --> 00:16:13.655
He's gone!

00:16:13.655 --> 00:16:15.157
He must be on the island somewhere!

00:16:15.157 --> 00:16:16.124
Huh?

00:16:16.124 --> 00:16:18.593
I must go and find Mr. Chris, fast!

00:16:18.593 --> 00:16:21.263
[Grunt] Mr. Chris!

00:16:34.276 --> 00:16:35.544
Oof!

00:16:35.877 --> 00:16:39.014
[Sounds of fighting]

00:16:41.149 --> 00:16:42.450
Come in, Shadow.

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:44.052
Shadow, do you read me?

00:16:44.052 --> 00:16:46.655
I have a little problem on my end.

00:16:46.655 --> 00:16:49.858
I'm sort of locked inside the
vault with the Chaos Emeralds.

00:16:49.858 --> 00:16:51.793
There's no way to open it from in here,

00:16:51.793 --> 00:16:52.827
so I'm stuck.

00:16:52.827 --> 00:16:54.362
SHADOW: I can't talk.

00:16:54.362 --> 00:16:56.698
ROUGE: Huh?
SHADOW: I have to go, now!

00:16:56.698 --> 00:16:59.334
You mean, you won't help me?

00:16:59.334 --> 00:17:01.269
SHADOW: Not right at this second, no.

00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:02.571
Uh! Oof!

00:17:02.571 --> 00:17:04.039
You can't leave me!

00:17:04.039 --> 00:17:06.141
Remember, I have the Emeralds.

00:17:06.374 --> 00:17:08.076
I'm busy right now!

00:17:08.076 --> 00:17:09.511
Oof!

00:17:09.511 --> 00:17:10.111
Ugh!

00:17:10.445 --> 00:17:11.313
Ugh.

00:17:11.313 --> 00:17:14.849
I should've known not to count on
that shady character for any help.

00:17:15.817 --> 00:17:16.318
Ha!

00:17:16.318 --> 00:17:16.785
Oof!

00:17:16.785 --> 00:17:17.519
Ha!

00:17:17.519 --> 00:17:20.288
[Panting]

00:17:20.288 --> 00:17:21.423
Sonic!

[Panting]

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:23.992
[Long sigh]

00:17:23.992 --> 00:17:27.229
I'm finished, and worse than that,
I'm losing three Emeralds, too!

00:17:27.229 --> 00:17:29.497
[Beeping]

00:17:29.497 --> 00:17:32.234
Shadow! Come in now! Shadow!

[Sounds of fighting]

00:17:41.343 --> 00:17:42.777
DR. EGGMAN: Shadow! Where are you?

00:17:42.777 --> 00:17:45.046
That detonator will go off any second!

00:17:45.046 --> 00:17:46.781
You have to get off the island now,

00:17:46.781 --> 00:17:48.984
or you're gonna be blown sky-high!

00:17:48.984 --> 00:17:50.218
Do you read me?

00:17:50.218 --> 00:17:51.353
Oh, no!

00:17:51.353 --> 00:17:53.822
I'm not waiting for you and Rouge any longer.

00:17:53.822 --> 00:17:55.824
You two are on your own.

00:17:55.824 --> 00:17:58.326
I have to get everybody of the island!

00:18:06.101 --> 00:18:08.169
[Panting]

00:18:08.169 --> 00:18:09.571
I found him!

00:18:09.571 --> 00:18:10.905
It's Sonic!

00:18:14.476 --> 00:18:17.212
Huh? That's not Sonic.

00:18:17.646 --> 00:18:19.414
Hmm. Hmm.

00:18:19.414 --> 00:18:20.915
Maria...

00:18:24.853 --> 00:18:26.288
When I found three Emeralds,

00:18:26.288 --> 00:18:28.089
I thought this was my lucky day.

00:18:28.089 --> 00:18:30.992
SHADOW: Rouge, this is Shadow. Come in.

00:18:31.092 --> 00:18:32.294
I'm here!

00:18:32.294 --> 00:18:34.229
SHADOW: Do you still have the Chaos Emeralds?

00:18:34.229 --> 00:18:35.930
Of course I still have them.

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:37.699
SHADOW: I'll be right there to pick them up.

00:18:37.699 --> 00:18:38.833
[Sigh]

00:18:38.833 --> 00:18:40.368
He's coming for the Chaos Emeralds,

00:18:40.368 --> 00:18:42.103
but what about me?

00:18:42.504 --> 00:18:44.272
Dr. Eggman, I'm going back in

00:18:44.272 --> 00:18:45.874
to pick up the Chaos Emeralds for you.

00:18:45.874 --> 00:18:46.841
Huh...

00:18:49.377 --> 00:18:52.280
[Beeping]

00:18:53.948 --> 00:18:55.850
Shadow, promise me!

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:57.519
Yes, Maria.

00:18:57.519 --> 00:18:59.454
You will be avenged!

00:18:59.454 --> 00:19:00.755
Chaos Control!

00:19:01.956 --> 00:19:02.857
Ah!

00:19:02.857 --> 00:19:05.260
Shadow! He's the one they want!

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.295
Now I can prove Sonic's innocent!

00:19:07.295 --> 00:19:09.531
Oof! Chris, wait!

00:19:09.531 --> 00:19:10.131
Huh?

00:19:10.131 --> 00:19:11.166
Oof!

00:19:11.166 --> 00:19:12.133
Chris?

00:19:12.767 --> 00:19:15.036
[Gasp] He is gone.

00:19:15.036 --> 00:19:17.706
[Crying]

00:19:18.273 --> 00:19:19.174
Huh?

00:19:19.174 --> 00:19:20.308
Shadow!

00:19:20.308 --> 00:19:21.943
Oof! Aah!

00:19:22.177 --> 00:19:24.212
[Gasp] What the-?

00:19:27.248 --> 00:19:28.483
Let's go!

00:19:28.483 --> 00:19:29.851
Hey, hold it, Shadow!

00:19:29.851 --> 00:19:31.720
You're not going to leave this kid behind?

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.856
It doesn't matter to me
what happens to that boy.

00:19:34.856 --> 00:19:36.358
[Groan] Hold on!

00:19:36.358 --> 00:19:38.393
My friend got arrested 'cause of you!

00:19:38.393 --> 00:19:39.661
He's still here!

00:19:39.661 --> 00:19:41.796
We have to get him off the island!

00:19:43.732 --> 00:19:45.333
Please, will you help me?

00:19:45.333 --> 00:19:47.736
I have to rescue Sonic somehow.

00:19:47.736 --> 00:19:50.372
He would rescue you if it
was the other way around.

00:19:50.372 --> 00:19:52.374
You have to help him, please!

00:19:54.075 --> 00:19:55.944
Please, Shadow?

00:19:55.944 --> 00:19:57.879
Maria...

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:04.419
[Beeping]

00:20:06.721 --> 00:20:07.922
[Long beep]

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:22.637
[Explosions]

00:20:29.077 --> 00:20:30.245
Hm!

00:20:40.288 --> 00:20:43.057
[Worried sighs]

00:20:43.558 --> 00:20:44.993
Mr. Chris...

00:20:45.393 --> 00:20:46.428
[Sigh]

00:20:46.428 --> 00:20:48.530
Mr. Chris!
