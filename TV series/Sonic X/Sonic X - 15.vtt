00:00:00.234 --> 00:00:02.736
CHRIS: Hey, Sonic,
I got you a cellphone!

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:04.738
This is gonna make things
a lot easier.

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:05.906
Oh, really?

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:07.474
Yeah, don't you see?

00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:09.543
Now we'll be able to reach
each other right away

00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:11.111
even when you're out on a run.

00:00:11.245 --> 00:00:14.381
We can talk anywhere now.
No sweat.

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:15.749
Hmm.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.253
Now, make sure you leave it on.

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:22.122
TAILS: Hey, Chris,
it's time to get going!

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:24.491
We've been waiting
outside for you.

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:26.126
Oops, I forgot.

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:27.861
Where are you guys going?

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.930
Now that we can
go out in public,

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.533
we're heading to Station Square
to go shopping.

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:34.701
We spent weeks hunting down
Chaos Emeralds,

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.904
but now it's time
to do some bargain hunting.

00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:39.106
So, I'm gonna shop till I drop.

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:41.308
There's no point in waiting
for you to take me

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:45.078
because I don't even know
where you are most of the time.

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:49.616
Oh! We can stay connected
all the time!

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:51.451
No, thanks.

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.556
Wait, Sonic!
What about your cellphone?

00:00:55.656 --> 00:00:58.025
Leave a message for me.

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:00.727
I guess he wants
to be left alone.

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:04.064
But why can't he be
left alone with me?!

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.334
Go, go, go, go, go

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:08.869
Gotta go fast

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.071
Gotta go fast

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:14.107
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:19.179
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:01:19.313 --> 00:01:20.981
Got ourselves a situation

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:23.283
Stuck in a new location

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:26.853
Without any explanation

00:01:26.954 --> 00:01:28.989
No talk of relaxation

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:30.624
Don't, don't, don't

00:01:30.724 --> 00:01:32.392
Don't blink, don't think

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:34.227
Just go, go, go, go

00:01:34.328 --> 00:01:35.696
Go, go

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.201
Sonic is on the run

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.103
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:46.840
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:46.974 --> 00:01:48.375
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:50.377
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:52.946
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:54.848
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:57.217
Sonic X

00:01:57.317 --> 00:02:00.053
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:02.089
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.991
Sonic X

00:02:10.383 --> 00:02:11.418
I don't understand

00:02:11.518 --> 00:02:14.287
why Sonic doesn't
want me calling him.

00:02:14.387 --> 00:02:16.289
Unfortunately, Sonic
is the kind of guy

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:18.258
who needs lots of privacy.

00:02:18.358 --> 00:02:21.261
But what will we do
if there's an emergency?

00:02:21.394 --> 00:02:24.297
Without a phone, we don't
have a way to reach him.

00:02:24.397 --> 00:02:25.698
Don't worry, Chris.

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.500
No matter where Sonic is,

00:02:27.634 --> 00:02:30.303
he has a way of showing up
when he has to.

00:02:30.403 --> 00:02:32.305
Are you sure?

00:02:32.405 --> 00:02:33.873
TOGETHER:
Count on it!

00:02:33.973 --> 00:02:35.308
Chao! Chao!

00:03:01.167 --> 00:03:03.002
Chao! Chao! Chao!

00:03:03.103 --> 00:03:04.804
Ta-da!

00:03:11.244 --> 00:03:12.579
Uh-oh.

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:14.681
[All gasp]

00:03:16.783 --> 00:03:18.685
That is so cool!

00:03:18.785 --> 00:03:21.187
This figure has
kung-fu kick action!

00:03:21.287 --> 00:03:23.890
Hey, Chris, look.

00:03:31.097 --> 00:03:33.500
Do you think they want this toy?

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.502
They're staring at me.

00:03:35.602 --> 00:03:36.603
Whoa!

00:03:36.736 --> 00:03:38.171
I want this one.

00:03:38.271 --> 00:03:40.507
Can we buy it, Mommy?

00:03:40.607 --> 00:03:41.441
Hmm?

00:03:41.541 --> 00:03:43.243
[Whimpers]

00:03:43.343 --> 00:03:45.879
I'm very sorry.

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:48.581
That thing's the real deal!

00:03:48.681 --> 00:03:52.218
I wonder who taught it
to talk, a dog trainer?

00:03:52.318 --> 00:03:55.622
Go up to it
and make it say something.

00:03:56.456 --> 00:03:58.191
Sorry, Tails.
Are you okay?

00:03:58.291 --> 00:03:59.759
[Laughs]

00:04:01.794 --> 00:04:02.862
Chris.

00:04:02.996 --> 00:04:04.898
Yeah?

00:04:05.498 --> 00:04:08.801
This is very weird.

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.912
Oh, I'm scared.

00:04:19.012 --> 00:04:20.513
Chao! Chao!

00:04:20.613 --> 00:04:23.082
How come everybody
keeps staring?

00:04:23.183 --> 00:04:25.084
You're all big-time celebrities

00:04:25.185 --> 00:04:28.188
ever since you helped
knock out Eggman's base.

00:04:28.288 --> 00:04:31.524
But we didn't go after
Dr. Eggman to become famous.

00:04:31.624 --> 00:04:34.661
Of course, if they ask me to
appear on TV or magazine covers,

00:04:34.794 --> 00:04:36.396
I won't turn them down.

00:04:36.496 --> 00:04:38.731
Sorry.
Guess it'll take awhile

00:04:38.865 --> 00:04:40.900
for people to get
used to you guys here.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.003
I'm not so sure they'll ever
get used to having us here.

00:04:44.103 --> 00:04:46.439
- [Sighs]
- MAN: Say cheese!

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.509
WOMAN:
Look over here! Smile!

00:04:52.912 --> 00:04:55.548
No more photographs!

00:04:57.917 --> 00:04:59.519
[Sighs]

00:04:59.619 --> 00:05:01.821
Let's try someplace else.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.692
Right this way.

00:05:11.297 --> 00:05:13.366
TAILS:
Come on, Amy!

00:05:19.005 --> 00:05:21.674
Oh, my!
They allow pets in here?

00:05:21.774 --> 00:05:23.610
Instead of escorting
those beasts

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.678
into our dining room
and creating a scene,

00:05:25.778 --> 00:05:27.213
they should check them
into the coatroom

00:05:27.313 --> 00:05:28.915
with the rest of the furs.

00:05:29.015 --> 00:05:32.185
I'll be right back
with your menus.

00:05:33.453 --> 00:05:35.888
This is a private club,
so we won't get hassled.

00:05:35.989 --> 00:05:38.424
I saw how brave
your friends were on TV.

00:05:38.524 --> 00:05:40.560
May I ask for their paw prints?

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.428
It's adorable!

00:05:42.528 --> 00:05:43.563
Chao!

00:05:43.696 --> 00:05:46.099
Oh!
What a cutie!

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:48.901
I want to bring them all home!

00:05:49.035 --> 00:05:50.069
Let me take a look.

00:05:50.203 --> 00:05:52.305
All right,
get your hands off of me.

00:05:52.405 --> 00:05:53.740
I just want to have some lunch!

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.609
Yeah, this is supposed to be
a fancy restaurant,

00:05:56.709 --> 00:05:58.611
not a wrestling ring!

00:05:59.212 --> 00:06:01.614
I want to go back home, Chris!

00:06:01.714 --> 00:06:04.117
[Whimpering]
Me too!

00:06:04.217 --> 00:06:07.053
Is this your natural color?

00:06:07.153 --> 00:06:08.788
[Giggles]

00:06:08.888 --> 00:06:11.190
Will you please go away?!

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:23.269
Okay, you guys,
just get ready to raise it up.

00:06:23.403 --> 00:06:25.405
- Get a digger in here.
- That's it.

00:06:25.538 --> 00:06:27.040
Where's the survey team?

00:06:27.173 --> 00:06:29.509
The power room was there.

00:06:29.609 --> 00:06:30.743
Huh?

00:06:30.843 --> 00:06:33.980
That doesn't appear
on the plans.

00:06:40.653 --> 00:06:42.555
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

00:06:46.626 --> 00:06:48.261
- Aah!
- Aah!

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.532
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

00:07:00.673 --> 00:07:02.575
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

00:07:24.664 --> 00:07:25.598
[Whimpers]

00:07:25.698 --> 00:07:27.533
That thing is huge!

00:07:37.677 --> 00:07:40.012
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

00:07:53.693 --> 00:07:55.595
When will you half-wits realize

00:07:55.695 --> 00:07:57.530
that it's useless
to try and trip me up

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.832
because I'm always
10 steps ahead of you?!

00:07:59.966 --> 00:08:02.468
I was expecting your president
to order an attack,

00:08:02.502 --> 00:08:04.971
and so I built
this flying fortress!

00:08:05.071 --> 00:08:07.106
Now I can escape
any further attacks,

00:08:07.206 --> 00:08:11.144
and then make a counterattack
anytime and anywhere!

00:08:11.244 --> 00:08:14.447
Dr. Eggman certainly is
a strategic genius.

00:08:14.547 --> 00:08:17.383
I only wish some of his
strategies worked occasionally.

00:08:17.483 --> 00:08:19.051
That's enough from you two!

00:08:19.152 --> 00:08:21.220
Cut the chatter
and get the ship ready.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.989
We've got work to do!

00:08:23.089 --> 00:08:25.158
He certainly is thin-skinned.

00:08:25.258 --> 00:08:27.193
That is the only place
where he is thin.

00:08:27.293 --> 00:08:29.162
Let's get moving!

00:08:29.295 --> 00:08:32.198
Set the ship's course
for Station Square.

00:08:35.401 --> 00:08:37.804
- Oh!
- Ohh!

00:08:40.406 --> 00:08:43.776
He's more dangerous
than ever now.

00:08:43.876 --> 00:08:45.278
MAYOR:
Are you sure?!

00:08:45.378 --> 00:08:46.813
Headed in this direction?!

00:08:46.913 --> 00:08:49.315
Well, can't you send
the Air Force to intercept him?

00:08:49.415 --> 00:08:51.150
Sir, look!

00:08:54.287 --> 00:08:55.555
Oh!

00:08:58.391 --> 00:08:59.392
[Sighs]

00:08:59.492 --> 00:09:00.993
What a waste.

00:09:01.093 --> 00:09:03.296
Our shopping spree was a flop.

00:09:03.396 --> 00:09:05.198
I'm sure things
will get a lot easier

00:09:05.298 --> 00:09:07.900
once people get used to
seeing you around.

00:09:08.034 --> 00:09:09.035
Huh?

00:09:09.168 --> 00:09:11.571
What's wrong, Chris?

00:09:11.671 --> 00:09:12.638
Look.

00:09:12.738 --> 00:09:14.073
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

00:09:16.676 --> 00:09:19.312
- Whoa!
- What is that thing?

00:09:27.553 --> 00:09:29.489
It's Eggman, isn't it?

00:09:29.589 --> 00:09:30.857
That's him.

00:09:30.957 --> 00:09:32.158
EGGMAN:
[Laughs evilly]

00:09:32.258 --> 00:09:34.260
You losers are about to learn

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.295
that you can never defeat me.

00:09:36.395 --> 00:09:38.297
I'm like a rubber ball.

00:09:38.397 --> 00:09:40.466
Every time you
try to slap me down,

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.902
I just keep bouncing back!

00:09:43.002 --> 00:09:44.804
Since your government
attacked me

00:09:44.937 --> 00:09:46.439
and destroyed my base,

00:09:46.572 --> 00:09:48.407
I'm going to destroy your city

00:09:48.508 --> 00:09:52.144
and rebuild my headquarters
right here!

00:09:55.181 --> 00:09:56.849
[Screaming]

00:10:07.426 --> 00:10:08.628
There's nowhere to go.

00:10:08.728 --> 00:10:10.062
The whole city will be wrecked

00:10:10.196 --> 00:10:12.098
if this demolition derby
keeps up!

00:10:12.198 --> 00:10:14.734
I sure wish Sonic
had kept that cellphone.

00:10:14.867 --> 00:10:17.837
Hey, maybe we can get
out of here.

00:10:22.475 --> 00:10:24.377
[All gasp]

00:10:36.289 --> 00:10:38.791
Let's move it!
Hurry!

00:10:44.797 --> 00:10:45.898
[Growls]

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.908
- Oh!
- Oh!

00:11:01.314 --> 00:11:02.214
It's Sonic!

00:11:02.315 --> 00:11:06.452
See, didn't I tell you
that he'd show up just in time?

00:11:06.552 --> 00:11:08.955
Let's play, Sonic.
For keeps.

00:11:09.055 --> 00:11:10.523
Fine with me, Eggman.

00:11:10.623 --> 00:11:12.658
Take your best shot.

00:11:17.096 --> 00:11:18.331
Hah!

00:11:19.098 --> 00:11:20.066
Steady.

00:11:20.199 --> 00:11:21.167
Ready.

00:11:21.267 --> 00:11:22.735
Fire!

00:11:37.216 --> 00:11:40.853
I have heard of a sonic boom,
but this is ridiculous.

00:11:53.432 --> 00:11:55.167
Whoa!

00:11:56.002 --> 00:11:57.370
[Groaning]

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:58.704
[Panting]

00:11:58.804 --> 00:11:59.939
Mm.

00:12:00.039 --> 00:12:02.475
Oh, no, he can't
reach Eggman's ship!

00:12:02.541 --> 00:12:04.877
We need the X-Tornado
to help him,

00:12:04.977 --> 00:12:06.445
but it's back home.

00:12:06.545 --> 00:12:09.048
We'll never get it in time.

00:12:10.282 --> 00:12:11.450
[Horn honks]

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.452
You need a lift?

00:12:13.552 --> 00:12:15.454
Uncle Sam!

00:12:17.223 --> 00:12:19.358
I'll get you guys home
in a flash.

00:12:19.492 --> 00:12:21.327
Buckle up for safety!

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:39.245
[Chuckles]

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:41.847
Aah!

00:12:44.717 --> 00:12:45.951
[Laughs]

00:12:46.052 --> 00:12:47.920
My falcon robots all come

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.356
with special
speed-seeking detectors.

00:12:50.423 --> 00:12:53.292
Sonic is running to his doom!

00:13:02.968 --> 00:13:03.936
Huh?

00:13:06.405 --> 00:13:07.506
It can't be!

00:13:07.606 --> 00:13:09.709
You can blow Sonic
out of the sky

00:13:09.809 --> 00:13:12.278
if you order those falcons
to self-destruct.

00:13:12.378 --> 00:13:14.313
Excellent idea!

00:13:14.413 --> 00:13:16.315
[Beeping]

00:13:18.584 --> 00:13:20.986
Whoa!

00:13:26.092 --> 00:13:27.526
[Grunting]

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:33.332
[Fingers screeching]

00:13:33.432 --> 00:13:35.835
- Aah!
- Aah!

00:13:36.802 --> 00:13:38.804
Sonic's a pain in the ears!

00:13:38.904 --> 00:13:40.840
Stop it!
Cut it out!

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:42.641
[Groaning]

00:13:45.945 --> 00:13:47.913
Whoa!

00:13:51.951 --> 00:13:53.853
Finish him off!

00:14:06.165 --> 00:14:09.101
Hey, do you think
you could slow down a bit?

00:14:09.201 --> 00:14:10.903
Are you kidding?!
Huh?

00:14:39.165 --> 00:14:40.566
Hey, thanks, Mr. Stewart!

00:14:40.666 --> 00:14:43.002
No problem.
Are you all okay?

00:14:43.102 --> 00:14:44.570
Hey, I know you.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:47.006
Yes, we met at a party
at Chris' house.

00:14:47.106 --> 00:14:49.575
I'm his teacher, Mr. Stewart.

00:14:49.675 --> 00:14:51.410
Yeah, now I remember.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:52.745
I forget things fast,

00:14:52.845 --> 00:14:54.947
but I remember them even faster.

00:14:55.047 --> 00:14:57.683
And I believe you're
Chris' uncle, Mister...

00:14:57.783 --> 00:14:59.351
"Mister" is
what they call my dad.

00:14:59.451 --> 00:15:01.687
- Just call me Sam.
- AMY: Hey!

00:15:01.787 --> 00:15:04.089
Aren't you forgetting
we have to get something?

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:05.891
The X-Tornado!

00:15:05.991 --> 00:15:07.393
Yeah!
That's right!

00:15:07.493 --> 00:15:08.594
Let's go!

00:15:08.694 --> 00:15:11.397
- But where are we going?
- Get in!

00:15:11.897 --> 00:15:13.999
Hang on, gang!

00:15:22.641 --> 00:15:23.976
Sam, speed it up!

00:15:24.076 --> 00:15:26.278
I can't reach my mirror.

00:15:27.146 --> 00:15:29.782
[Gasps]
They're gonna fire!

00:15:43.796 --> 00:15:44.597
All right!

00:15:44.697 --> 00:15:46.665
You brought the X-Tornado!

00:15:56.108 --> 00:15:58.010
The X-Tornado!

00:16:02.114 --> 00:16:03.315
Yeah!

00:16:12.491 --> 00:16:13.826
Get them now!

00:16:13.959 --> 00:16:15.394
Blast away!

00:16:21.433 --> 00:16:22.835
It's Sonic!

00:16:25.437 --> 00:16:27.139
We can't fight Eggman here.

00:16:27.239 --> 00:16:28.707
Those buildings
will get wrecked!

00:16:28.807 --> 00:16:29.708
Chris is right.

00:16:29.808 --> 00:16:32.544
We have to get Eggman
away from the city somehow.

00:16:32.645 --> 00:16:35.447
Right!
Leave it to me.

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:42.922
[Growls]

00:16:44.023 --> 00:16:46.892
[All laughing]

00:16:49.261 --> 00:16:50.796
I've had it with that hog!

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:52.898
That's the last time
he'll dis me.

00:16:53.032 --> 00:16:57.169
Move it! Turn this ship around
and go after Sonic!

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:00.139
What chance does
he have against Sonic?

00:17:00.239 --> 00:17:03.876
I estimate his chance of
defeating Sonic at zero.

00:17:09.848 --> 00:17:13.419
Could somebody please
call housekeeping?

00:17:15.321 --> 00:17:17.222
It worked.

00:17:25.531 --> 00:17:27.433
Charge up the blaster cannon.

00:17:30.002 --> 00:17:31.303
Fire!

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.461
[Laughs]

00:17:49.804 --> 00:17:51.773
Victory!

00:17:56.311 --> 00:17:58.579
[Alarm blaring]

00:17:58.713 --> 00:18:02.150
The energy circuit got fried.
We're in trouble.

00:18:02.283 --> 00:18:03.151
What's wrong?

00:18:03.284 --> 00:18:05.186
In a few seconds,
we'll lose power,

00:18:05.286 --> 00:18:07.455
and then we're gonna be
sitting ducks.

00:18:07.555 --> 00:18:09.557
Oh, no!

00:18:09.657 --> 00:18:12.493
I won't miss Sonic this time.

00:18:12.593 --> 00:18:14.996
Get ready for another blast!

00:18:20.134 --> 00:18:22.570
I could use an oil change.

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:25.974
We take care of other robots,
but who takes care of us?

00:18:26.074 --> 00:18:27.642
Get moving!

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:31.346
So the X-Tornado can only fly
at full speed

00:18:31.479 --> 00:18:32.513
for a few more seconds?

00:18:32.647 --> 00:18:35.116
Yeah, if we're lucky.

00:18:35.249 --> 00:18:38.686
Okay. Then you should fly
full speed at the bridge.

00:18:38.786 --> 00:18:40.688
But that's crazy.

00:18:40.788 --> 00:18:43.624
Trust me.
This is our only chance.

00:18:46.794 --> 00:18:49.297
Is the blaster cannon
powered up yet?

00:18:49.397 --> 00:18:51.099
Almost, Doctor.

00:18:51.199 --> 00:18:53.601
It appears that we have company.

00:18:59.307 --> 00:19:01.142
What is this?

00:19:19.227 --> 00:19:21.696
Hang on.
Here we go.

00:19:29.037 --> 00:19:30.605
Blow them away!

00:19:30.705 --> 00:19:32.974
The cannon is still recharging.

00:19:45.753 --> 00:19:47.755
No!

00:19:50.024 --> 00:19:52.427
We have lost
all our controls, Doctor.

00:19:52.527 --> 00:19:54.295
We must abandon ship at once.

00:19:54.395 --> 00:19:56.697
Curse you, hedgehog!

00:19:56.798 --> 00:19:58.366
I'll get you!

00:20:16.484 --> 00:20:18.653
Great job, Sonic!

00:20:20.688 --> 00:20:22.123
My hero!

00:20:22.223 --> 00:20:26.127
Well, we stopped Eggman again,
but I bet he'll be back.

00:20:26.227 --> 00:20:28.496
Looks like we're gonna be
fighting against Eggman

00:20:28.596 --> 00:20:30.198
for a long time.

00:20:30.298 --> 00:20:32.066
He'll never surrender.

00:20:32.166 --> 00:20:33.534
You're right.

00:20:33.634 --> 00:20:35.803
Eggman's got plenty
of tricks up his sleeve.

00:20:35.903 --> 00:20:38.072
This battle is only beginning.

00:20:46.714 --> 00:20:49.617
He just might win.
