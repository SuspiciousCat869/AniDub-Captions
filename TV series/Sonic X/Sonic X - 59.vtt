00:00:03.034 --> 00:00:05.070
There's no doubt about it.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.640
Chris built this machine to
teleport himself to Sonic's world.

00:00:09.074 --> 00:00:10.875
Then let's use it to find him!

00:00:11.443 --> 00:00:14.212
Unfortunately, Chris seems
to have designed the machine

00:00:14.212 --> 00:00:16.314
so that nobody but him
could be teleported.

00:00:16.314 --> 00:00:17.148
What?

00:00:17.148 --> 00:00:19.017
Can't you reprogram it?

00:00:20.885 --> 00:00:22.787
[Crying]

00:00:22.787 --> 00:00:24.189
There is one thing.

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.191
Even though we can't teleport ourselves,

00:00:26.191 --> 00:00:30.562
it seems we can use the machine to teleport
material objects to Sonic's world.

00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:31.463
Really?

00:00:31.463 --> 00:00:32.430
Yes.

00:00:34.265 --> 00:00:35.867
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:35.867 --> 00:00:38.970
Gotta go fast

00:00:39.604 --> 00:00:41.906
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:00:44.175 --> 00:00:47.712
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:00:47.712 --> 00:00:49.781
Got ourselves a situation

00:00:49.781 --> 00:00:51.816
Stuck in a new location

00:00:51.816 --> 00:00:55.420
Without any explanation

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.489
No talk of relaxation

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.124
Don't, don't, don't

00:00:59.124 --> 00:01:00.925
Don't blink, don't think

00:01:00.925 --> 00:01:02.727
Just go, go, go, go

00:01:02.727 --> 00:01:04.229
Go, go

00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.768
Sonic is on the run

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:11.669
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:11.669 --> 00:01:15.373
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:15.373 --> 00:01:19.077
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:01:19.077 --> 00:01:21.479
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.381
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:01:23.381 --> 00:01:25.884
Sonic X

00:01:25.884 --> 00:01:27.819
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:01:28.553 --> 00:01:30.622
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:01:30.622 --> 00:01:31.656
Sonic X

00:01:39.585 --> 00:01:43.756
I wonder where Cream and the others
are, and how they're doing.

00:01:43.756 --> 00:01:46.325
I hope everything's okay.

00:01:46.726 --> 00:01:47.760
Oh!

00:01:54.934 --> 00:01:57.036
This looks like- Ohh!

00:01:59.305 --> 00:02:00.273
Oh...

00:02:01.874 --> 00:02:03.776
[Phone rings]

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.115
[Snoring] [Phone rings]

00:02:09.115 --> 00:02:10.917
Charmy, get the phone.

00:02:10.917 --> 00:02:13.519
[Moaning]

00:02:15.087 --> 00:02:17.056
Gah! That's not what I meant!

00:02:17.056 --> 00:02:18.891
You better answer before they hang up.

00:02:18.891 --> 00:02:19.725
You little-!

00:02:19.725 --> 00:02:22.361
I already told you the check's in the mail!

00:02:22.361 --> 00:02:24.297
Vector? Is that you?

00:02:24.297 --> 00:02:26.799
Ah! Cream's mother! How have you been?

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.135
I'm calling because I need your help.

00:02:29.135 --> 00:02:31.470
My agency's at your service, ma'am.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.140
I'd like to explain the job to you in person.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.043
Sure, we'll come over right away.

00:02:37.043 --> 00:02:38.144
Aah!

00:02:38.144 --> 00:02:39.245
[Laughing]

00:02:39.245 --> 00:02:41.147
What're you laughin' at?

00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:46.953
[Sobbing]

00:02:46.953 --> 00:02:48.354
Hey, don't cry.

00:02:48.354 --> 00:02:50.289
[Sobbing] Okay!

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.525
Now, where's Espio?

00:02:52.525 --> 00:02:53.793
He's right there.

00:02:56.128 --> 00:02:57.830
Get me the pepper mill.

00:02:58.564 --> 00:02:59.765
Sure, boss.

00:03:02.768 --> 00:03:03.736
[Sneezing]

00:03:03.736 --> 00:03:05.204
[Both laugh]

00:03:05.204 --> 00:03:06.706
Can't you buy an alarm clock?

00:03:08.874 --> 00:03:12.411
All of this suddenly appeared out of nowhere.

00:03:12.411 --> 00:03:15.548
Chris' family must have sent his belongings.

00:03:15.548 --> 00:03:18.217
He's traveling in space with Cream,

00:03:18.217 --> 00:03:21.587
and I was hoping you could deliver
these things to their ship.

00:03:21.587 --> 00:03:23.489
And please check on Cream.

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:24.557
I've been worried about her.

00:03:24.557 --> 00:03:25.958
Don't worry, ma'am.

00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.860
We'll take care of it, no problem.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:28.995
Vector.

00:03:28.995 --> 00:03:30.329
What's the matter?

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.797
We can't do this job.

00:03:31.797 --> 00:03:33.032
How come?

00:03:33.032 --> 00:03:35.935
If you think we're cruising
the galaxy without a ship,

00:03:35.935 --> 00:03:37.103
you're spaced out.

00:03:37.103 --> 00:03:38.704
Where can we get a ship?

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.281
Looks like that problem's solved.

00:03:49.281 --> 00:03:52.184
I hope you boys have a safe trip.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.492
It looks peaceful out there.

00:03:59.492 --> 00:04:01.193
No sign of any Metarex.

00:04:01.193 --> 00:04:02.495
[Chuckling]

00:04:03.996 --> 00:04:07.867
It's nice to travel in space when
you can take the time to stargaze.

00:04:07.867 --> 00:04:09.502
They really are beautiful.

00:04:09.502 --> 00:04:10.803
Grr.

00:04:10.803 --> 00:04:12.772
Why don't you move your king?

00:04:13.406 --> 00:04:15.674
Well, call me when your make your move.

00:04:15.674 --> 00:04:17.610
I'm gonna go for a run.

00:04:23.582 --> 00:04:24.750
Grr.

00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:26.585
Ah!

00:04:26.585 --> 00:04:27.486
That's check-

00:04:27.486 --> 00:04:29.555
Huh? Where'd Sonic go?

00:04:29.555 --> 00:04:30.856
Huh? Huh? Huh!

00:04:30.856 --> 00:04:34.927
Hey, Sonic! It's your move!

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:38.197
You're not giving up are ya?

00:04:40.966 --> 00:04:43.035
Whoa! Aah!!!

00:04:43.035 --> 00:04:44.136
Sonic!

00:04:44.703 --> 00:04:48.674
Whoaaaaaa!

00:04:48.674 --> 00:04:50.076
That's just great.

00:04:50.076 --> 00:04:53.212
Sonic can't get back, so
somebody has to go after him.

00:04:53.212 --> 00:04:56.215
Say what? Sonic can't get back to the ship?

00:04:56.215 --> 00:04:59.118
And he's getting farther
away from us every second.

00:04:59.118 --> 00:05:02.922
Aah! We have to go rescue him, now!

00:05:02.922 --> 00:05:05.424
I know, but how will we get to him?

00:05:05.424 --> 00:05:08.327
Think of something fast,
before he's out of reach.

00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:12.665
I've got an idea, but first
we need to find a rope!

00:05:16.035 --> 00:05:17.903
Hang in there, Sonic. I'm comin'.

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:31.684
What's the matter?

00:05:31.684 --> 00:05:32.918
We're being followed.

00:05:32.918 --> 00:05:35.621
That ship will catch up to us soon.

00:05:36.055 --> 00:05:37.556
Who are they?

00:05:37.556 --> 00:05:39.125
We can't be sure yet.

00:05:39.125 --> 00:05:41.327
But they're probably Metarex.

00:05:41.327 --> 00:05:44.497
Our sensors aren't picking
up any weapons on the ship.

00:05:44.497 --> 00:05:47.266
Do you know where Sonic and Knuckles are?

00:05:47.266 --> 00:05:48.767
Sonic slipped off the ship,

00:05:48.767 --> 00:05:51.604
so Knuckles had to take a
rocket pack and go rescue him.

00:05:51.604 --> 00:05:52.771
Aah!

00:05:52.771 --> 00:05:55.708
But we could've gone after
him in the Blue Typhoon!

00:05:55.708 --> 00:05:58.978
Right now, we have to worry about
getting this ship battle-ready.

00:05:58.978 --> 00:06:02.214
That other ship is definitely
trying to intercept us.

00:06:02.214 --> 00:06:04.116
What if they board our ship?

00:06:04.116 --> 00:06:06.051
We'll be ready!

00:06:06.552 --> 00:06:09.555
I wish we knew how to use
the ship's communicator.

00:06:09.555 --> 00:06:12.291
I guess we'll just have to surprise them.

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:14.393
Want a chip?

00:06:14.393 --> 00:06:16.395
Stay out of those boxes.

00:06:16.395 --> 00:06:17.963
Espio's right!

00:06:17.963 --> 00:06:20.866
We was hired to deliver
that stuff, not devour it.

00:06:23.536 --> 00:06:26.172
I'm gonna go let 'em know we're here.

00:06:30.109 --> 00:06:32.344
Which way's the bridge?

00:06:32.344 --> 00:06:34.013
Must be that way.

00:06:35.381 --> 00:06:37.683
All right, everybody. Get ready.

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:42.521
Hello? Anybody there?

00:06:42.521 --> 00:06:43.989
I've come to-

00:06:43.989 --> 00:06:45.424
Aah!

00:06:45.424 --> 00:06:48.427
Hey, watch it! Ow! Ah!

00:06:50.696 --> 00:06:55.167
I haven't got this beat up since the
time we staked out that shark tank.

00:06:55.167 --> 00:06:56.135
Really?

00:06:56.135 --> 00:06:58.070
You mean those guys attacked ya?

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.573
I think it would be better if I handle this.

00:07:06.679 --> 00:07:07.913
What a mess!

00:07:07.913 --> 00:07:10.249
It's lucky that Metarex didn't get past us,

00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:12.184
or it could've wrecked the whole ship.

00:07:12.184 --> 00:07:13.152
Huh?

00:07:13.852 --> 00:07:15.120
Huh?

00:07:17.156 --> 00:07:18.457
Uh-oh.

00:07:18.924 --> 00:07:20.159
Aah!

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:20.893
Amy?

00:07:20.893 --> 00:07:21.994
What's going on?

00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:23.929
L-l-l-look!

00:07:23.929 --> 00:07:24.697
[All gasp]

00:07:24.697 --> 00:07:26.432
It's an invisible Metarex!

00:07:26.432 --> 00:07:27.900
Let's get it!

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.870
[Pandemonium]

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:32.805
I am in pain.

00:07:32.805 --> 00:07:34.273
[Panting]

00:07:34.273 --> 00:07:36.242
Looks like you're in paint, too.

00:07:36.242 --> 00:07:38.877
I can't believe I was discovered so easily.

00:07:38.877 --> 00:07:41.447
I'm so humiliated, I wish I could disappear.

00:07:41.447 --> 00:07:43.949
Maybe they'll listen to me, Vector.

00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:44.750
You sure?

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.218
I won't let you down.

00:07:46.218 --> 00:07:48.320
Just be sure to protect yourself, Charmy.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.622
It's dangerous in there.

00:07:49.622 --> 00:07:50.856
I know!

00:07:51.857 --> 00:07:53.792
Snack time, everybody!

00:07:53.792 --> 00:07:55.394
We've got tea and cake.

00:07:55.394 --> 00:07:57.329
Wow! Perfect timing.

00:07:57.329 --> 00:07:58.998
I was just starting to get hungry.

00:07:58.998 --> 00:08:00.566
This looks delicious!

00:08:00.566 --> 00:08:01.734
What kind of cake is it?

00:08:01.734 --> 00:08:04.403
I call it Cream's Strawberry Cream Cake.

00:08:04.403 --> 00:08:05.771
I made it myself.

00:08:05.771 --> 00:08:08.240
I vote that we make Cream
the chef of the ship.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.975
She can make cake for every meal.

00:08:09.975 --> 00:08:10.976
[Laughing]

00:08:10.976 --> 00:08:12.544
Did somebody say "cake?"

00:08:14.513 --> 00:08:15.948
It's a Metarex!

00:08:15.948 --> 00:08:16.849
Let's get it!

00:08:16.849 --> 00:08:18.017
ALL: Yeah!

00:08:18.017 --> 00:08:19.518
Charge!

00:08:19.518 --> 00:08:23.789
[Pandemonium]

00:08:26.855 --> 00:08:28.390
It's totally unfair!

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.658
We came in peace, and got torn to pieces!

00:08:30.658 --> 00:08:33.561
Yeah, we flew across the
galaxy to help these guys.

00:08:33.561 --> 00:08:35.029
I didn't expect a party,

00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:37.432
but they didn't have to
treat us like piñatas!

00:08:37.432 --> 00:08:38.967
They are most ungrateful.

00:08:38.967 --> 00:08:41.903
But I will not step quietly
through the door of defeat.

00:08:41.903 --> 00:08:44.272
I say we head for home, pronto.

00:08:44.272 --> 00:08:46.574
We ain't gonna give up yet, Charmy.

00:08:46.574 --> 00:08:49.110
The reputation of our agency is at stake,

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.713
and we're gonna do the
job we was hired to do.

00:08:51.713 --> 00:08:53.214
We gonna board their ship again,

00:08:53.214 --> 00:08:55.884
and this time, we'll succeed,
'cause I'm totally fired up!

00:08:58.553 --> 00:09:00.488
And while I'm getting warmed up,

00:09:00.488 --> 00:09:02.724
let's go cool off and think of a strategy.

00:09:02.724 --> 00:09:04.993
I mean, there's no rush or anything, right?

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.728
Huh?

00:09:07.695 --> 00:09:10.498
Come on. Let's take a coffee break.

00:09:10.498 --> 00:09:12.434
[Eating noisily]

00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:15.270
Huh? Do you see something?

00:09:16.204 --> 00:09:18.473
Looks like the Metarex are taking off.

00:09:18.473 --> 00:09:19.841
They're escaping?

00:09:19.841 --> 00:09:22.710
Don't worry. I'll go stop
them in the X Tornado!

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:23.978
Uh!

00:09:23.978 --> 00:09:26.247
You're really gonna go
after them all by yourself?

00:09:26.247 --> 00:09:29.884
Relax! You said yourself that ship
doesn't have any weapons on it.

00:09:29.884 --> 00:09:31.686
That's right!

00:09:31.686 --> 00:09:34.456
I guess if they're retreating,
they can't be very tough.

00:09:37.358 --> 00:09:38.860
[Sneezing]

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:39.794
Huh?

00:09:39.794 --> 00:09:42.664
You know, my snout's starting
to feel kind of stuffed up.

00:09:42.664 --> 00:09:45.266
I wonder if I'm gettin' a cold?

00:09:45.266 --> 00:09:47.502
Maybe you're just allergic to space.

00:09:47.502 --> 00:09:49.471
[Sneezing]

00:10:03.284 --> 00:10:06.154
All systems ready! Now, let's go!

00:10:23.638 --> 00:10:26.474
Catapult is set. Take off!

00:10:37.819 --> 00:10:38.786
Hang on a minute...

00:10:38.786 --> 00:10:41.089
That little, rickety house looks familiar.

00:10:41.089 --> 00:10:42.657
It couldn't be!

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:50.865
Hey, it's okay, you guys!

00:10:50.865 --> 00:10:53.067
We didn't know it was you!

00:10:53.067 --> 00:10:55.470
Looks like he wants to
negotiate. Should we talk?

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:57.438
It's probably just some sort of ruse.

00:10:57.438 --> 00:10:58.773
Espio's right.

00:10:58.773 --> 00:11:00.608
I bet they're trying to trick us.

00:11:00.608 --> 00:11:02.544
Nobody tricks me.

00:11:02.544 --> 00:11:03.678
Hold onto your seats, boys.

00:11:03.678 --> 00:11:06.347
We're gonna shake these turkeys. Here we go!

00:11:12.787 --> 00:11:14.455
They're too fast.

00:11:14.455 --> 00:11:17.625
I'll never be able to catch
them in the X Tornado.

00:11:18.326 --> 00:11:19.727
I saw everything.

00:11:19.727 --> 00:11:22.797
Looks like that ship's gonna be
harder to stop than you thought.

00:11:22.797 --> 00:11:26.034
Yeah, you'll have to catch them
in the Blue Typhoon after all.

00:11:26.034 --> 00:11:27.302
Will do!

00:11:27.302 --> 00:11:28.469
Once you catch up to them,

00:11:28.469 --> 00:11:31.573
try grabbing onto the hull of their
ship with the mechanical claw.

00:11:31.573 --> 00:11:33.508
I've been wanting to use that!

00:11:33.508 --> 00:11:34.475
Hold on, everybody.

00:11:34.475 --> 00:11:36.311
We're gonna pull a quick 180.

00:11:41.516 --> 00:11:44.052
Let's catch those Metarex!

00:11:44.419 --> 00:11:46.387
Uh... correction, Chris.

00:11:46.387 --> 00:11:48.856
That isn't a Metarex ship, after all.

00:11:48.856 --> 00:11:50.692
Then who are they?

00:11:50.692 --> 00:11:51.192
Aah!

00:11:51.192 --> 00:11:52.627
What is it, Charmy?

00:11:52.627 --> 00:11:54.862
It looks like they're
trying to chase us down.

00:11:54.862 --> 00:11:56.397
Uh! No way!

00:11:56.397 --> 00:11:57.498
See?

00:11:58.666 --> 00:11:59.834
Well, uh...

00:11:59.834 --> 00:12:03.538
I'll bust this bucket's space drive
trying to escape if I have to.

00:12:03.538 --> 00:12:05.139
Vector, no!

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.776
[All screaming]

00:12:08.776 --> 00:12:10.545
Aah!

00:12:10.545 --> 00:12:12.080
Slow down, Vector!

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.314
No, speed it up!

00:12:13.314 --> 00:12:14.282
Huh?

00:12:14.282 --> 00:12:15.917
We stopped.

00:12:15.917 --> 00:12:17.285
I didn't do it.

00:12:17.285 --> 00:12:18.353
So then...

00:12:18.353 --> 00:12:19.854
How'd we stop?

00:12:21.723 --> 00:12:23.658
I've completed the capture, Tails.

00:12:23.658 --> 00:12:25.660
I'm bringing the ship in.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.029
It's Vector, Espio, and Charmy.

00:12:28.029 --> 00:12:30.231
Their radio must be broken or something.

00:12:30.231 --> 00:12:32.467
Huh? You mean it wasn't a Metarex?

00:12:32.467 --> 00:12:34.202

Well, at least it's all settled now.

00:12:43.511 --> 00:12:44.946
We forgive you.

00:12:44.946 --> 00:12:47.448
It was just a big misunderstanding.

00:13:10.371 --> 00:13:12.840
They sure went to a lot of trouble.

00:13:15.043 --> 00:13:17.178
[Grunt] I think that's everything.

00:13:17.178 --> 00:13:18.346
Thanks, Vector.

00:13:18.346 --> 00:13:20.548
I'll do all the unpacking and stuff myself.

00:13:20.548 --> 00:13:21.916
Great.

00:13:25.787 --> 00:13:29.190
Grandpa must've found a way to
teleport these things from home.

00:13:29.791 --> 00:13:33.061
I'm sure Mom and Dad are worried about me.

00:13:33.061 --> 00:13:35.697
They don't even know if I made it here okay.

00:13:35.697 --> 00:13:38.866
I wish I could find a way
to tell them I'm all right.

Hey! Wait up, you guys.

00:13:47.547 --> 00:13:49.616
Don't leave yet. Come have some tea.

All right! Cake!

is, we must be leaving.

Hang on, Espio.

These folks are offering
us their hospitality.

By the way, Cream.

00:14:12.806 --> 00:14:14.040
Yes, Vector?

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.644
Creamy, I hope you'll forgive me if I
sound just like a nosey, old croc...

00:14:17.644 --> 00:14:18.445
Huh?

00:14:18.445 --> 00:14:20.814
But are you sure you should
be playing around in space?

00:14:20.814 --> 00:14:22.149
I'm not playing around!

00:14:22.149 --> 00:14:24.017
I'm helping save the universe!

00:14:24.017 --> 00:14:26.620
I don't think you realize
what's at stake here, Vector.

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.022
We're on a mission to stop the Metarex.

00:14:29.022 --> 00:14:31.057
It's serious business.

00:14:31.057 --> 00:14:34.528
Maybe it is, but I think Cream's
mother wants Cream to come home.

00:14:34.528 --> 00:14:36.196
My mother doesn't want that.

00:14:36.196 --> 00:14:37.097
She trusts me,

00:14:37.097 --> 00:14:40.133
because she knows that I'm
here to help my friends.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.669
Come on, Cosmo.

00:14:43.503 --> 00:14:45.071
Why did you say that, Vector?

00:14:45.071 --> 00:14:47.374
Cream's mother didn't tell
us to bring the girl home.

00:14:47.808 --> 00:14:49.543
She told us to check on her.

00:14:49.543 --> 00:14:52.446
Yeah, that's what she told us,
but she was trying to be strong.

00:14:52.446 --> 00:14:55.682
She was really thinking, "I'm
so worried about my little baby!

00:14:55.682 --> 00:14:57.551
You gotta save her, Vector!

00:14:57.551 --> 00:14:59.486
She's too young to be out there all alone!"

00:14:59.486 --> 00:15:02.289
Hold on! Cream's mother never said that.

00:15:02.289 --> 00:15:04.658
She thought it, and I'm a detective.

00:15:04.658 --> 00:15:05.926
So I detected it.

00:15:05.926 --> 00:15:08.862
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to another episode of

We're taking Cream with us!

But, Vector-

00:15:13.633 --> 00:15:14.835
No buts about it.

00:15:14.835 --> 00:15:16.736
I made a solemn promise to Cream's mama,

00:15:16.736 --> 00:15:18.738
and I ain't going back on my word.

00:15:18.738 --> 00:15:20.674
You never made any promise.

00:15:20.674 --> 00:15:21.741
Uh!

00:15:21.741 --> 00:15:22.943
I made a promise.

00:15:22.943 --> 00:15:24.644
You just didn't hear it.

00:15:24.644 --> 00:15:25.145
[Groan]

00:15:25.145 --> 00:15:27.547
'Cause I made it from the bottom of my heart.

00:15:27.547 --> 00:15:28.748
This is hopeless.

00:15:28.748 --> 00:15:31.518
I can't argue with someone
who refuses to make sense.

00:15:31.518 --> 00:15:34.421
I'm tossing Cream into this
bag, and then we're gone.

There's no stoppin' him.

00:15:41.495 --> 00:15:45.065
It doesn't look like we're gonna
find any Chaos Emeralds around here.

00:15:45.065 --> 00:15:46.166
I agree.

00:15:46.166 --> 00:15:47.934
Since there aren't many planets around here,

00:15:47.934 --> 00:15:50.170
the Emeralds wouldn't be drawn this way.

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:51.872
Why's that Tails?

00:15:51.872 --> 00:15:56.209
Chaos Emeralds are attracted by the
gravitational fields around planets.

00:15:56.209 --> 00:15:56.843
I see!

00:15:56.843 --> 00:15:59.446
I think we'd better go search someplace else.

00:16:00.447 --> 00:16:02.549

00:16:02.549 --> 00:16:03.517

You sure you don't want to
travel with us a little?

00:16:05.719 --> 00:16:08.722
We can use all the help we
can get battling the Metarex.

00:16:08.722 --> 00:16:10.657
We will fight with you in spirit.

00:16:10.657 --> 00:16:12.359

No stowaways allowed on this ship [Grunting]

00:16:53.633 --> 00:16:56.570
You are taking me back,
and taking Cream, too.

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:57.604
[Grunting]

00:16:57.604 --> 00:17:00.307
[Grunts]

00:17:00.307 --> 00:17:02.576
Give it to him, Cosmo.

00:17:02.576 --> 00:17:03.343
Chao chao!

00:17:03.343 --> 00:17:04.377
Over here, Vector.

00:17:04.377 --> 00:17:05.946
I want to play, too.

00:17:05.946 --> 00:17:06.947
[Shout]

00:17:06.947 --> 00:17:07.547
Maybe not.

00:17:07.547 --> 00:17:08.348
Well, don't just-

00:17:08.348 --> 00:17:09.816
What is it?

00:17:09.816 --> 00:17:12.852
We've got company!

00:17:14.788 --> 00:17:15.789
Huh?

00:17:16.356 --> 00:17:17.991
I'll handle it this time.

00:17:21.695 --> 00:17:22.996
[Grunting]

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.133
One, two, three!

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:31.004
[Gasping]

00:17:31.504 --> 00:17:33.373
Well, that kind of worked.

00:17:33.907 --> 00:17:35.642
They just broke the ship's claw.

00:17:35.642 --> 00:17:37.544
Well, there's got to be
some way to catch them.

00:17:37.544 --> 00:17:40.647
We can't let 'em get away with
Cosmo, Cream, and Cheese.

00:17:40.647 --> 00:17:43.650
Let me try to get the back-up claw working.

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:45.885
I thought I was gonna run out of rope.

00:17:45.885 --> 00:17:47.821
Thanks a bunch, Knuckles!

00:17:47.821 --> 00:17:48.788
Heh!

00:17:49.189 --> 00:17:51.591
Gotta fly! I'll see you back at the ship.

00:17:52.559 --> 00:17:54.094
Uh... Sonic!

00:17:54.094 --> 00:17:56.096
So, can you get it to work?

00:17:56.096 --> 00:18:00.133
I think, but it'll take a little
ingenuity on Chris' part.

00:18:00.133 --> 00:18:01.267
No problem.

00:18:01.267 --> 00:18:02.102
[Knocking]

00:18:02.736 --> 00:18:03.803
Sonic!

00:18:03.803 --> 00:18:05.538
We were worried about you!

00:18:05.538 --> 00:18:07.841
Think you could catch a ship
while you're out there?

00:18:07.841 --> 00:18:08.842
Hm?

00:18:08.842 --> 00:18:11.478
Vector took Cosmo, Cream, and Cheese.

00:18:11.478 --> 00:18:12.746
Huh.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.882
Come on! Give me more speed!

00:18:25.792 --> 00:18:26.793
Huh?

00:18:31.297 --> 00:18:32.365
You made it!

00:18:32.365 --> 00:18:34.100
I don't know what this is about,

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.603
but Cream and the others are comin' with me!

00:18:36.603 --> 00:18:38.405
I don't wanna to fight you, Sonic,

00:18:38.405 --> 00:18:40.707
but I said I'd bring little
Cream back home to her mama,

00:18:40.707 --> 00:18:42.342
and nobody's gonna stop me!

00:18:42.342 --> 00:18:43.777
Let her go!

00:18:43.777 --> 00:18:45.345
Or you'll be sorry!

00:18:45.345 --> 00:18:46.479
Oh, yeah?

00:18:46.479 --> 00:18:48.248
It's lucky for you that you're blue,

00:18:48.248 --> 00:18:50.850
'cause nobody's gonna notice all your
bruises when I'm done whoopin' ya!

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:52.152
Now put up your dukes!

00:18:52.152 --> 00:18:52.652
Whoa!

00:18:52.652 --> 00:18:53.887
Aaaaah!

00:18:53.887 --> 00:18:54.654
Huh!

00:18:54.654 --> 00:18:56.589
Is this what you meant to do?

00:18:56.589 --> 00:18:57.424
[Grunting]

00:18:57.424 --> 00:18:58.491
Ah!

00:18:58.491 --> 00:18:59.526
[Groaning]

00:18:59.526 --> 00:19:01.861
There's plenty more where that came from!

00:19:01.861 --> 00:19:03.863
Will you please stop fighting.

00:19:04.197 --> 00:19:05.398
Don't you understand?

00:19:05.398 --> 00:19:07.867
Only one of us can decide
what Cream should do.

00:19:08.835 --> 00:19:10.036
CHRIS: Cosmo's right.

00:19:10.036 --> 00:19:12.706
Cream's mom may worry about
her, and want her to come home,

00:19:12.706 --> 00:19:15.075
and we may want her to
keep traveling with us,

00:19:15.075 --> 00:19:17.744
but we don't get to choose what Cream does.

00:19:17.744 --> 00:19:19.813
Only Cream can decide that.

00:19:21.014 --> 00:19:23.583
Sorry, kid, but you know how parents are.

00:19:23.583 --> 00:19:25.285
Believe me, Vector, I do.

00:19:25.285 --> 00:19:26.052
But, still.

00:19:26.052 --> 00:19:27.921
So what's it gonna be, Cream?

00:19:27.921 --> 00:19:31.091
I want to stay here and help,
because it's important to me.

00:19:31.091 --> 00:19:32.559
I'm sure my mom's worried,

00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:35.228
but I'm sure she also trusts
me to do the right thing.

00:19:36.496 --> 00:19:37.430
[Sigh]

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:40.233
Espio, Charmy, we're outta here.

00:19:40.233 --> 00:19:42.836
Our mission has been accomplished, guys.

00:19:42.836 --> 00:19:43.436
Huh?

00:19:43.436 --> 00:19:45.205
Aren't we supposed to take Cream?

00:19:45.205 --> 00:19:47.674
We were sent to make sure Cream was okay,

00:19:47.674 --> 00:19:49.576
and that's what we've done.

00:19:51.244 --> 00:19:52.378
Hey, Cream!

00:19:52.378 --> 00:19:53.146
Yeah?

00:19:53.146 --> 00:19:56.182
Be sure to drop your mother
a line from time to time.

00:19:56.182 --> 00:19:56.916
I will!

00:19:56.916 --> 00:19:58.418
[Camera shutter clicks]

00:19:58.418 --> 00:19:59.519
[Chuckling]

00:19:59.519 --> 00:20:01.454
[Fax machine rings]

00:20:02.155 --> 00:20:03.723
What could that be?

00:20:05.658 --> 00:20:06.726
Aww.

00:20:07.427 --> 00:20:12.499
I miss you, Cream, but I know
you're doing something important.

00:20:16.202 --> 00:20:18.204
No Chaos Emeralds in this area.

00:20:26.713 --> 00:20:28.448
Why's that capsule here?

00:20:29.015 --> 00:20:30.416
No!

00:20:30.717 --> 00:20:32.652
It couldn't be!
