WEBVTT

00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:06.339
We have to figure out how
Chris' transporter works.

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:08.608
Try typing in a different password.

00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:11.444
I know! Maybe the password
Chris used was "Sonic."

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:12.913
Let's see...

00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:14.047
Please work!

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:15.315
[All groan in disappointment]

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:17.250
I think we'd better face facts.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.119
We'll never log into Chris' system.

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.121
Man, Chris made it impossible

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:23.089
for anybody to follow
him into Sonic's world.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.025
He didn't want us to take the risk.

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:28.562
It'd be worth the risk to see
Sonic and the others again.

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:30.597
I wish Chris had talked
to us before he left,

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:32.966
so we could decide for ourselves.

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:38.972
I'm sure Chris is having a blast
in Sonic's world right now.

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:42.175
I wonder why Chris hasn't
tried to contact us yet.

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:45.045
I bet he's having so much
fun that he just forgot.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:45.979
Probably.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:47.280
Thanks for the help, guys!

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.315
Try not to worry.

00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:49.950
DANNY AND FRANCES: Bye Helen!

00:00:57.657 --> 00:00:59.893
Chris, I hope you're all right.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:01.528
I miss you.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.650
It doesn't look like there are
any Chaos Emeralds around here.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.653
Chris, are you sure this
scanner is working okay?

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:27.887
Yeah, I am,

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:30.657
but there's a lot of interference
in this part of the galaxy.

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:31.858
Why is that?

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:34.160
It looks like this
entire region of space

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.664
has been warped by some kind
of bizarre gravitational force.

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:45.739
Do you think the Metarex
are responsible for this?

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:46.940
They probably are.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.642
If the warping continues
at this rate,

00:01:48.642 --> 00:01:51.845
it'll soon spread out across
the whole galaxy and beyond.

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:54.614
First the Metarex go around
stealing Planet Eggs,

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:57.283
and now they're bending outer
space all out of shape.

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.618
Those creeps!

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:00.120
Look! The sensors found something.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.522
Those Metarex have to be
stopped once and for all!

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:04.591
Uh... huh?

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:08.428
[Beeping]

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:10.664
I think we found a Chaos Emerald.

00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:11.898
Hey, Tails!

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:14.100
I see it. Ready to intercept.

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:16.603
Hey, look! Something's
coming towards us.

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:18.738
[Beeping]

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.108
It's a small asteroid.

00:02:22.108 --> 00:02:24.577
The Chaos Emerald's
inside the asteroid.

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:26.346
I'll pull it in.

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:38.324
Weird-looking asteroid.

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:41.628
Hey! It's trying to move away!

00:02:41.628 --> 00:02:43.763
That's no asteroid, you guys...

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:45.765
It's a spaceship!

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:47.634
Whoa!

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.602
Go, go, go, go, go

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:52.706
Gotta go fast

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.642
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:02:57.911 --> 00:03:01.448
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:03.516
Got ourselves a situation

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.552
Stuck in a new location

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:09.155
Without any explanation

00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:11.224
No talk of relaxation

00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:12.859
Don't, don't, don't

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.661
Don't blink, don't think

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:16.463
Just go, go, go, go

00:03:16.463 --> 00:03:17.964
Go, go

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:23.503
Sonic is on the run

00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:25.405
Sonic, he's number one

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:29.109
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.812
-<i>Gotta go fast</i>
-<i>Sonic</i>

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:35.215

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.117
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:03:37.117 --> 00:03:39.619
Sonic X

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:41.554
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:03:42.288 --> 00:03:44.357
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:45.391
Sonic X

00:03:51.045 --> 00:03:54.048
We were afraid that you were
going to crush our ship.

00:03:54.048 --> 00:03:57.518
I'm really sorry, but we thought
your ship was an asteroid.

00:03:57.518 --> 00:03:59.920
Our ship is a highly
advanced space vehicle

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.356
with ion propulsion
engines and a hyperdrive!

00:04:02.356 --> 00:04:03.524
Mm-hm.

00:04:04.225 --> 00:04:06.527
So, what brought you to
this part of the galaxy?

00:04:06.527 --> 00:04:09.864
Our world is sick, and we must
find somebody who can heal it.

00:04:09.864 --> 00:04:12.033
I'm Lue, the ship's captain.

00:04:12.033 --> 00:04:13.634
My name is Lylim.

00:04:13.634 --> 00:04:15.536
And I am Momo.

00:04:15.536 --> 00:04:17.305
It's nice to meet you.

00:04:17.305 --> 00:04:20.408
You didn't happen to find a Chaos
Emerald during your trip, did you?

00:04:20.408 --> 00:04:22.376
What's a Chaos Emerald?

00:04:22.376 --> 00:04:26.580
It's a really beautiful gem about
this size, and it glows sometimes.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.516
Hm?

00:04:30.017 --> 00:04:31.952
Are you talking about this?

00:04:32.553 --> 00:04:34.488
It's the Chaos Emerald!

00:04:34.488 --> 00:04:36.223
They did find it.

00:04:36.223 --> 00:04:37.658
Thanks a lot!

00:04:37.658 --> 00:04:38.626
Uh!

00:04:38.626 --> 00:04:40.061
What's the matter?

00:04:40.561 --> 00:04:42.563
We didn't say that
you could have it.

00:04:42.563 --> 00:04:43.798
ALL: Huh?

00:04:43.798 --> 00:04:47.935
We spotted this gem during our trip,
and we thought it looked beautiful.

00:04:47.935 --> 00:04:50.538
So we picked it up and
decided to keep it.

00:04:50.538 --> 00:04:51.939
That's our Emerald!

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:53.074
Hand it over!

00:04:53.074 --> 00:04:55.009
No! You can't have it!

00:04:55.976 --> 00:04:56.944
We found it.

00:04:56.944 --> 00:04:59.080
It belongs to us.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.615
I want that Chaos Emerald now!

00:05:01.615 --> 00:05:02.516
[Knuckles growls]
Whoa, Knuckles!

00:05:02.516 --> 00:05:04.618
You're just making it worse.

00:05:04.618 --> 00:05:06.220
Let's try to work it out.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.522
Some of us are civilized
around here.

00:05:08.522 --> 00:05:10.758
Fine! Then you get the Emerald!

00:05:11.225 --> 00:05:12.693
That Emerald's important.

00:05:12.693 --> 00:05:15.596
We really need it
to save the galaxy.

00:05:15.596 --> 00:05:18.532
I'm sorry, but we like this gem.

00:05:18.532 --> 00:05:20.534
We don't want to share it.

00:05:21.302 --> 00:05:23.037
Please, give it to me.

00:05:23.037 --> 00:05:24.004
ALL: Hmm.

00:05:24.004 --> 00:05:25.740
Finders keepers!

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.540
Whoa!

00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:30.411
This gem is more beautiful than
anything we've ever seen before.

00:05:30.411 --> 00:05:32.346
We're going to take it home.

00:05:32.346 --> 00:05:34.782
We can't wait to show
it to our friends!

00:05:34.782 --> 00:05:36.250
[Muttering]

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.752
What'll we do now?

00:05:43.758 --> 00:05:46.494
I don't see why we're taking
these pip-squeaks home

00:05:46.494 --> 00:05:48.396
when they won't give
us the Chaos Emerald.

00:05:48.396 --> 00:05:50.531
We want to find out why
their planet's sick,

00:05:50.531 --> 00:05:52.466
and see if there's something
we can do to help.

00:05:52.466 --> 00:05:55.603
Planet Marmolim is such a magical
place that once you visit,

00:05:55.603 --> 00:05:57.338
you'll never want to leave.

00:05:57.338 --> 00:06:00.808
We have fortune tellers, magic
charms, and even love spells.

00:06:00.808 --> 00:06:02.810
You have love spells?

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.413
Yes, and they're
extremely powerful.

00:06:05.413 --> 00:06:06.881
[Beeping]

00:06:06.881 --> 00:06:08.082
What are we waiting for?

00:06:08.082 --> 00:06:10.785
Let's go full speed ahead
to Planet Marmolim!

00:06:10.785 --> 00:06:12.720
Uh... Sure, Amy.

00:06:25.232 --> 00:06:26.734
Hey, everybody! They're back!

00:06:26.734 --> 00:06:27.968
Thank goodness!

00:06:27.968 --> 00:06:29.637
We're glad you're okay!

00:06:29.637 --> 00:06:30.838
Welcome back!

00:06:30.838 --> 00:06:33.741
We were afraid that we'd
never see you again.

00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:35.976
I'm sorry if we worried you.

00:06:35.976 --> 00:06:38.179
We're giving you this to
thank you for the ride.

00:06:38.179 --> 00:06:39.547
It's about time.

00:06:39.547 --> 00:06:41.482
Thanks, we really appreciate it.

00:06:41.482 --> 00:06:44.218
So where can we find this
love spell you told me about?

00:06:44.218 --> 00:06:45.553
Right this way, please!

00:06:45.553 --> 00:06:46.287
Okay!

00:06:46.287 --> 00:06:47.922
Come on, Sonic!

00:06:47.922 --> 00:06:49.857
[Panting]

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:53.761
Amy! Wait!

00:06:53.761 --> 00:06:55.830
Boy, is she hopeless.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.531
Before we try that love spell,

00:06:57.531 --> 00:06:59.133
let's go visit a fortune teller!

00:07:00.201 --> 00:07:02.736
Well? Do we have a future together?

00:07:02.736 --> 00:07:03.838
[Yawning]

00:07:03.838 --> 00:07:14.882
[Crowd chatter]

00:07:14.882 --> 00:07:16.984
They sell magic here?

00:07:16.984 --> 00:07:19.687
Visitors used to come here
from all over the galaxy to

00:07:19.687 --> 00:07:21.989
find out their fortunes,
or to buy magic charms,

00:07:21.989 --> 00:07:24.091
'til our planet
started getting sick.

00:07:24.091 --> 00:07:25.626
Hmm.

00:07:25.626 --> 00:07:27.595
What do they sell at that stall?

00:07:27.595 --> 00:07:30.498
They have charms and potions
that can cure anything.

00:07:30.498 --> 00:07:32.967
You can find headache
amulets, hiccup remedies,

00:07:32.967 --> 00:07:35.002
and even spells that
fight athlete's foot.

00:07:35.002 --> 00:07:37.304
Chris, you have a problem
with athlete's foot?

00:07:37.304 --> 00:07:38.672
No!

00:07:41.642 --> 00:07:43.577
I'm not sure about this.

00:07:43.577 --> 00:07:46.480
I've never had anybody
tell me my fortune before.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.216
You can ask him any questions
you want about your future.

00:07:49.216 --> 00:07:50.651
How exciting!

00:07:50.651 --> 00:07:52.953
What do you think we should
ask him about, Cheese?

00:07:52.953 --> 00:07:53.854
Chao!

00:07:53.854 --> 00:07:56.023
Something's wrong here.

00:07:56.023 --> 00:07:57.224
Their planet is sick,

00:07:57.224 --> 00:07:58.926
but they don't seem to care.

00:08:03.597 --> 00:08:04.632
Lue!

00:08:04.632 --> 00:08:06.133
Greetings, Ghana.

00:08:13.173 --> 00:08:14.542
The coins are clear.

00:08:14.542 --> 00:08:18.012
They predict that you will soon
part with a large sum of money.

00:08:18.012 --> 00:08:19.647
Do they say how much?

00:08:19.647 --> 00:08:21.282
Yes, 10 Fleebos...

00:08:21.282 --> 00:08:23.584
which is exactly what you
owe me for this prediction.

00:08:23.584 --> 00:08:25.886
That's the same prediction
as last time I came here.

00:08:25.886 --> 00:08:27.888
[Everyone laughs]

00:08:27.888 --> 00:08:29.890
This is no time for jokes.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.761
We have the power to look into the
future, but we cannot change it.

00:08:33.761 --> 00:08:35.696
Our fate is already decided.

00:08:35.696 --> 00:08:37.464
What will be, will be.

00:08:37.464 --> 00:08:38.766
But...

00:08:38.766 --> 00:08:41.235
I see you are always
rushing into action.

00:08:41.235 --> 00:08:45.239
But your haste is going to cause great
sorrow to those who are closest to you.

00:08:45.239 --> 00:08:47.508
These magic coins predict it.

00:08:48.375 --> 00:08:49.476
[Gasp]

00:08:55.516 --> 00:08:56.917
Wait, Cosmo!

00:08:58.819 --> 00:09:00.521
Will she be okay?

00:09:00.521 --> 00:09:03.424
Her future is too cloudy to
predict with any certainty,

00:09:03.424 --> 00:09:05.359
but I do see romance in her future.

00:09:05.359 --> 00:09:06.594
Strange...

00:09:06.594 --> 00:09:08.462
Plants and animals
usually don't get along.

00:09:08.462 --> 00:09:09.463
Huh?

00:09:14.268 --> 00:09:16.003
Hey, slow down, Cosmo!

00:09:16.003 --> 00:09:18.172
Don't let that fortune
teller upset ya.

00:09:18.172 --> 00:09:21.809
After all, nobody can really predict
what'll happen in the future.

00:09:21.809 --> 00:09:24.578
I've never felt so helpless
in my entire life.

00:09:24.578 --> 00:09:27.114
I know I don't want to
harm you or our friends,

00:09:27.114 --> 00:09:29.883
but that fortune teller
says I'm destined to.

00:09:30.784 --> 00:09:32.386
Cosmo...

00:09:32.386 --> 00:09:34.288
It can't be true. [Crying]

00:09:34.288 --> 00:09:36.223
It'll be okay.

00:09:36.223 --> 00:09:37.324
Wait!

00:09:40.194 --> 00:09:41.228
Huh?

00:09:53.024 --> 00:09:55.126
This is called Romance Rock.

00:09:58.162 --> 00:10:00.098
Ooh, I love this place.

00:10:00.098 --> 00:10:02.300
If you want the love spell
to join you both forever,

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.968
first you'll have
to break this rock.

00:10:03.968 --> 00:10:05.269
Joined forever?

00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:07.371
Oh, Sonic, I know we can break it!

00:10:07.371 --> 00:10:10.108
I know it! Ooh!

00:10:10.108 --> 00:10:13.010
Sonic and I will
never be apart again!

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:14.545
Here goes!

00:10:15.113 --> 00:10:15.913
Huh!

00:10:15.913 --> 00:10:17.281
Where's he going?

00:10:19.784 --> 00:10:20.785
Huh?

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.188
Well, according to
this crystal ball,

00:10:24.188 --> 00:10:26.657
you are about to do
something very foolish.

00:10:27.191 --> 00:10:29.127
Hmm, something foolish?

00:10:29.127 --> 00:10:31.596
Is there anything I
can do to stop myself?

00:10:31.596 --> 00:10:33.231
There's only one thing.

00:10:33.231 --> 00:10:34.899
Put this magic cloth on your head

00:10:34.899 --> 00:10:37.702
and run through town
clucking like a chicken.

00:10:37.702 --> 00:10:38.803
I'll try it!

00:10:38.803 --> 00:10:41.439
Thanks! I hate making
a fool of myself.

00:10:41.439 --> 00:10:43.441
That sounds pretty foolish to me.

00:10:43.441 --> 00:10:46.244
Once again, Ghana's
prediction will come true.

00:10:51.749 --> 00:10:53.684
That was Sonic.

00:10:53.684 --> 00:10:55.086
Come back, Sonic!

00:10:55.086 --> 00:10:55.853
Huh?

00:10:55.853 --> 00:10:57.788
[Panting]

00:10:57.788 --> 00:10:59.056
Where are you going?

00:10:59.056 --> 00:11:00.358
We broke Romance Rock,

00:11:00.358 --> 00:11:04.295
but we still have to go visit the
Lake of Love and Matchmaker Mountain!

00:11:04.295 --> 00:11:05.730
[Panting]

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:06.797
Huh?

00:11:06.797 --> 00:11:10.401
Amy would probably have better
luck if she didn't push so hard.

00:11:10.401 --> 00:11:13.538
It's a pity you don't have anybody
to bring to Romance Rock.

00:11:13.538 --> 00:11:17.408
Uh... I sort of do, but
she's back on my planet.

00:11:17.408 --> 00:11:18.376
[Laughing]

00:11:18.376 --> 00:11:20.912
I can tell you really
like her a lot.

00:11:20.912 --> 00:11:22.580
So, what's her name, huh?

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:23.514
Hey!

00:11:23.514 --> 00:11:25.616
[Laughter]

00:11:25.616 --> 00:11:26.918
Hey, Chris!

00:11:26.918 --> 00:11:28.719
Hey, what happened to Cosmo?

00:11:28.719 --> 00:11:30.555
I though she went with you.

00:11:30.555 --> 00:11:31.489
Huh?

00:11:32.657 --> 00:11:34.058
Chao chao chao chao!

00:11:34.058 --> 00:11:36.561
Hm. Is something wrong?

00:11:43.901 --> 00:11:48.339
I want to save the galaxy from the
Metarex and help my new friends,

00:11:48.339 --> 00:11:52.610
but it seems like I'm only going
to make things worse for everybody.

00:12:02.286 --> 00:12:03.988
There you are, Cosmo.

00:12:03.988 --> 00:12:05.323
I'm glad you're okay.

00:12:05.323 --> 00:12:07.858
We were worried about you.

00:12:08.926 --> 00:12:10.161
Chao chao chao!

00:12:10.161 --> 00:12:11.229
[Laughing]

00:12:11.229 --> 00:12:12.597
Hi, Cheese.

00:12:19.337 --> 00:12:21.272
Thanks for checking
up on me, Cream.

00:12:21.272 --> 00:12:22.974
You and Cheese are good friends.

00:12:22.974 --> 00:12:24.041
After you left,

00:12:24.041 --> 00:12:27.078
that fortune teller said that
most plant and animal species

00:12:27.078 --> 00:12:28.746
don't get along as well as we do.

00:12:28.746 --> 00:12:31.048
I wonder why they find
it hard to make friends.

00:12:31.048 --> 00:12:33.985
I guess because we're so
different from each other.

00:12:36.887 --> 00:12:38.055
In all the galaxy,

00:12:38.055 --> 00:12:40.825
it's hard to find different kinds
of beings getting along together.

00:12:40.825 --> 00:12:42.860
That's why Sonic and the
rest of you are special...

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.962
because you can make friends
with almost anybody.

00:12:44.962 --> 00:12:46.897
If a friendship like ours is rare,

00:12:46.897 --> 00:12:48.599
that makes it extra special.

00:12:48.599 --> 00:12:49.600
Chao!

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.702
I feel the same way as you both do.

00:12:52.403 --> 00:12:55.506
Sonic? Sonic? Sonic?

00:12:55.506 --> 00:12:58.075
Maybe this means Sonic
doesn't like you so much.

00:12:58.075 --> 00:12:59.677
That isn't true!

00:12:59.677 --> 00:13:00.978
Whenever I get into trouble,

00:13:00.978 --> 00:13:03.281
Sonic always comes
running to save me.

00:13:03.281 --> 00:13:06.517
I'll never forget when we both
got back from Chris's world.

00:13:06.517 --> 00:13:08.519
Sonic picked a flower for me.

00:13:08.519 --> 00:13:10.354
He said, "This is for you, Amy."

00:13:10.354 --> 00:13:11.455
Oh, Sonic!

00:13:11.455 --> 00:13:12.390
Amy!

00:13:12.957 --> 00:13:14.125
Huh?

00:13:14.125 --> 00:13:17.094
Cosmo, aren't you curious if
there's romance in your future?

00:13:17.094 --> 00:13:18.129
I guess so.

00:13:18.129 --> 00:13:19.263
What are you waiting for?

00:13:19.263 --> 00:13:20.231
Let's go!

00:13:20.231 --> 00:13:21.799
You'll love it, Cosmo!

00:13:21.799 --> 00:13:23.200
Chao chao chao chao!

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.803
[All laughing]

00:13:25.803 --> 00:13:28.706
Soon your heart will
belong to another...

00:13:28.706 --> 00:13:31.609
Hmmmmmmm.

00:13:31.609 --> 00:13:32.910
You will be struck.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:33.911
[All gasp]

00:13:33.911 --> 00:13:34.779
Love struck.

00:13:34.779 --> 00:13:35.680
[All giggle]

00:13:39.183 --> 00:13:41.652
Cosmo, what's going
on with you and Tails?

00:13:41.652 --> 00:13:43.454
I don't know what you mean.

00:13:43.454 --> 00:13:47.024
Well, its obvious that you and
Tails really like each other.

00:13:48.292 --> 00:13:51.829
Really, Amy, I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:54.465
Hmm. You're lying.

00:13:54.465 --> 00:13:56.167
That isn't true, Amy!

00:13:56.167 --> 00:13:59.537
I'm sure that Tails couldn't
possibly be interested in me.

00:13:59.537 --> 00:14:01.939
I have a feeling he
finds me annoying.

00:14:01.939 --> 00:14:03.407
If Tails doesn't like you,

00:14:03.407 --> 00:14:05.309
then why are you two
always together?

00:14:05.309 --> 00:14:05.976
Chao chao!

00:14:05.976 --> 00:14:07.244
Forget about Tails and me.

00:14:07.244 --> 00:14:09.547
How are things going
with you and Sonic?

00:14:10.114 --> 00:14:11.782
Hmm.

00:14:11.782 --> 00:14:13.718
What's the matter?

00:14:13.718 --> 00:14:16.320
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have brought it up.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.489
[Laughing]

00:14:18.489 --> 00:14:20.091
Everything will turn out okay,

00:14:20.091 --> 00:14:21.859
because Momo gave
me a magical spell

00:14:21.859 --> 00:14:24.061
so I can make Sonic mine forever.

00:14:25.029 --> 00:14:26.063
Ha!

00:14:26.564 --> 00:14:29.900
I'll catch Sonic in a trap, and
his heart will burn with love!

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:33.871
[Evil laughter]

00:14:49.781 --> 00:14:51.816
What's all that stuff, Sonic?

00:14:51.816 --> 00:14:54.252
The Marmolims gave me
these charms to protect me

00:14:54.252 --> 00:14:55.820
when I try to save their world.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.489
I guess it can't hurt.

00:14:57.489 --> 00:14:58.923
There's some kind
of disease growing

00:14:58.923 --> 00:15:00.859
underground where
the Planet Egg was.

00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:02.327
You have to destroy it.

00:15:02.327 --> 00:15:05.096
The only problem is there's
a lot of water in that area.

00:15:05.096 --> 00:15:07.632
Water! Are you kidding?

00:15:07.632 --> 00:15:08.600
Let's see...

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.235
The Marmolim who gave me this charm

00:15:10.235 --> 00:15:12.237
told me it works against water.

00:15:12.237 --> 00:15:14.472
[Chuckling]

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:21.913
Route all energy to the
Sonic Power Cannon.

00:15:22.514 --> 00:15:25.416
Load the cannon and get
ready to fire at my command.

00:15:25.416 --> 00:15:27.018
Here we go!

00:15:27.018 --> 00:15:29.020
Proceed with takeoff.

00:15:38.496 --> 00:15:40.431
Adjust cannon angle.

00:15:52.443 --> 00:15:54.946
Sonic, get set for launch!

00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:59.851
[Excited crowd babble]

00:16:00.218 --> 00:16:02.587
Sonic Power Cannon, fire!

00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:04.422
[All gasp]

00:16:20.138 --> 00:16:23.541
[Crowd chatters with anticipation]

00:16:43.094 --> 00:16:45.997
[Heartbeat]

00:16:48.266 --> 00:16:49.634
Sonic did it!

00:17:07.752 --> 00:17:09.354
I think it worked.

00:17:09.354 --> 00:17:11.255
Sonic saved the planet!

00:17:11.255 --> 00:17:13.191
ALL: Thank you, Sonic!

00:17:13.191 --> 00:17:15.326
I thought this charm
was gonna keep me dry,

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:17.061
but if you ask me, it's all wet!

00:17:17.061 --> 00:17:18.262
Whoa!

00:17:18.262 --> 00:17:20.398
Somebody shut off the faucet!

00:17:20.398 --> 00:17:30.875
[Excited crowd chatter]

00:17:31.442 --> 00:17:33.177
What's wrong, Cosmo?

00:17:33.177 --> 00:17:35.179
Why are you here by yourself?

00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:36.514
Hi, Tails.

00:17:36.514 --> 00:17:39.250
The Marmolims are really
happy their planet was saved.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.386
You must be pleased, too.

00:17:41.386 --> 00:17:44.956
I feel lucky to be working
with such terrific teammates.

00:17:44.956 --> 00:17:46.658
Especially with you.

00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:49.093
[Gasp] I didn't do anything.

00:17:49.093 --> 00:17:50.762
You're wrong, Cosmo.

00:17:50.762 --> 00:17:51.696
Huh?

00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:54.565
You found us to help
you stop the Metarex.

00:17:54.565 --> 00:17:56.668
Don't ever forget that.

00:17:57.201 --> 00:17:59.671
You're not sorry you
found us, are ya?

00:17:59.671 --> 00:18:00.872
[Gasp]

00:18:00.872 --> 00:18:02.573
Of course I'm sorry.

00:18:02.573 --> 00:18:03.574
How could you think that?

00:18:03.574 --> 00:18:05.510
Oh! That came out wrong.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.712
I mean, I'm not sorry I met you!

00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:09.981
[Chuckling]

00:18:09.981 --> 00:18:11.716
Don't worry. I know what you meant.

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:13.317
I'll see you later.

00:18:13.317 --> 00:18:15.086
Hold on, Tails!

00:18:15.086 --> 00:18:16.454
Ah! Whoa!

00:18:16.454 --> 00:18:17.855
Ohh!

00:18:17.855 --> 00:18:18.456
Huh?

00:18:18.456 --> 00:18:19.457
Oh!

00:18:19.457 --> 00:18:20.725
Whoa!

00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:22.660
Aah!

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.395
Uh!

00:18:26.297 --> 00:18:28.933
Ah...

00:18:29.634 --> 00:18:30.601
Huh...

00:18:34.539 --> 00:18:35.873
Whoa!

00:18:37.975 --> 00:18:39.343
Are you okay?

00:18:39.343 --> 00:18:40.545
I'm fine.

00:18:40.545 --> 00:18:42.246
I wonder what that was.

00:18:42.246 --> 00:18:44.082
Huh? Huh.

00:18:47.118 --> 00:18:48.086
Wow.

00:18:48.519 --> 00:18:51.122
You gave Amy a matchmaking spell?

00:18:51.122 --> 00:18:53.057
It's the strongest one we have.

00:18:53.057 --> 00:18:55.460
The couple dives into
the Lake of Love,

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.528
and afterwards, looks
at the full moon,

00:18:57.528 --> 00:19:00.131
and then they'll be
joined together forever!

00:19:00.131 --> 00:19:04.135
It sounds like Amy is finally
going to see her dream come true!

00:19:04.135 --> 00:19:05.770
She can't fail!

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.071
Amy even set up a trap

00:19:07.071 --> 00:19:08.973
so that she and Sonic
would fall into the lake

00:19:08.973 --> 00:19:10.775
at the exact moment the moon rose.

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:13.578
[Laughter]

00:19:13.578 --> 00:19:16.180
So they must be together right now.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:17.281
Huh?

00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:18.649
Thanks, pal.

00:19:18.649 --> 00:19:20.251
This should hit the spot.

00:19:20.251 --> 00:19:20.952
Sonic?

00:19:20.952 --> 00:19:22.286
Huh?

00:19:22.286 --> 00:19:23.688
Something wrong?

00:19:30.061 --> 00:19:33.164
[Both giggling]

00:19:34.265 --> 00:19:37.168
Every time I come up with a
way to capture Sonic's heart,

00:19:37.168 --> 00:19:39.103
he makes a last-minute getaway!

00:19:39.103 --> 00:19:41.339
This is totally unfair!

00:19:41.339 --> 00:19:42.273
Grrr!!!

00:19:42.273 --> 00:19:44.175
That trap was set for Sonic!

00:19:44.175 --> 00:19:46.210
I wanted to get my romance rolling,

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:49.413
and now I have to watch you
two go gaga over each other!

00:19:49.413 --> 00:19:50.815
This is outrageous!

00:19:50.815 --> 00:19:54.018
Go find your own planet
to fall in love on!

00:19:54.018 --> 00:19:55.653
Aaah!

00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:59.153
