00:00:00.501 --> 00:00:01.969
Last time on Sonic X,

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:03.804
our heroes crash-landed on the Egg Carrier

00:00:03.804 --> 00:00:06.440
to search for Amy and the
rest of the Master Emerald.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.675
Eggman caught Amy and
snatched a Chaos Emerald

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:10.410
away from her feathered friend Lily.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.846
Meanwhile, Chris and Big rescued Froggy,

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:15.983
only to find themselves in the
clutches of the Chaos creature!

00:00:15.983 --> 00:00:19.386
But Sonic and Knuckles showed up
and they were de-slimed in no time!

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:23.156
Eggman dropped a ticking time bomb
into the middle of Station Square,

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:26.093
but Tails used his technical
know-how to save the day.

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:27.094
What's next?

00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:29.796
Find out now on Sonic X!

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.765
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:34.835
Gotta go fast

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.771
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:43.610
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.646
Got ourselves a situation

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:47.714
Stuck in a new location

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:51.318
Without any explanation

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.387
No talk of relaxation

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.022
Don't, don't, don't

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:56.823
Don't blink, don't think

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:58.625
Just go, go, go, go

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.127
Go, go

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:05.666
Sonic is on the run

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.534
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:11.271
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:14.942
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:17.377
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:19.279
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:21.782
Sonic X

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:23.684
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.520
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.554
Sonic X

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:42.169
I've gotta get this Emerald
to Knuckles somehow.

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:43.437
But how can I?

00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:46.106
[Propellers]

00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:50.277
I know! We'll use the X Tornado!

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:52.245
[Propellers]

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:53.213
Good afternoon!

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:54.781
This is Scarlet Garcia,

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:58.719
reporting to you live from
inside the SSTV Newscopter.

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.589
Citizens of Station Square are breathing
a collective sigh of relief today

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:07.728
after narrowly avoiding a surprise
attack by the notorious Dr. Eggman.

00:02:07.728 --> 00:02:10.430
Yesterday, residents were
thrown into a state of panic

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.900
when Dr. Eggman aimed a missile
into the center of the city.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.203
A missile housing a ticking time bomb

00:02:16.203 --> 00:02:18.872
that threatened to explode at any minute.

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:20.807
Aren't they going to show Tails?

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:21.775
Chao!

00:02:21.775 --> 00:02:26.613
The situation seemed hopeless as tension
mounted and terror spread throughout the city.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:29.583
However, thanks to the quick
thinking of Mr. Miles Prower,

00:02:29.583 --> 00:02:32.986
known to his friends as Tails, the
danger was ultimately averted

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.655
and calm was restored.

00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:39.059
City officials have announced plans to honor
Mr. Prower for his outstanding bravery.

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:41.962
I didn't know your real
name was Miles, Tails.

00:02:41.962 --> 00:02:43.964
I like Tails better.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.368
I agree. Tails is much more colorful.

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:50.537
Thanks, Mr. Tanaka.

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:54.041
Are all these strange people
outside here to see Tails?

00:02:54.041 --> 00:02:56.843
Maybe you might wanna lay low
with us for a while, Tails,

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:58.278
and catch up on your rest.

00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:00.514
Yeah! We haven't seen you in a long time!

00:03:00.514 --> 00:03:01.548
Chao!

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:05.218
I can't stay, Cream. I'm supposed
to look for the X Tornado today.

00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:06.486
I know!

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:07.921
Just leave it to me, Tails.

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:09.856
I've got the perfect idea.

00:03:10.824 --> 00:03:13.593
[Murmuring]

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:14.795
[All gasp]

00:03:16.897 --> 00:03:18.231
Hello!

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:19.199
Huh?

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.769
Pardon me! Time to walk
the little one! [Giggle]

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.006
Hey, lady! You sure you're not
hiding Tails in that thing?

00:03:27.174 --> 00:03:28.675
I think you're pullin' a fast one!

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:30.911
We demand to see what you've got in there!

00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:34.681
ALL: Show us! Show us!

00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:37.684
Well alright, I will show
you, but he's very shy.

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:40.187
Gaga!

00:03:40.187 --> 00:03:41.188
[Gasp]

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:43.957
Gaga gaga!

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:46.693
Isn't he a handsome little pumpkin pie?

00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:49.196
He looks just like his daddy!

00:03:49.196 --> 00:03:51.531
But I say he has my eyes.

00:03:58.138 --> 00:04:01.007
Come on out, Tails. The coast is clear.

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:02.576
That was pretty close, Ella,

00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:03.977
but we fooled 'em.

00:04:03.977 --> 00:04:06.613
You make a great baby, Mr. Tanaka!

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:08.548
Glad to be of help, Tails.

00:04:08.548 --> 00:04:09.516
Ga!

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:10.884
Bye!

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:21.128
AMY: He doesn't mean to be bad!

00:04:21.128 --> 00:04:23.697
It's Eggman that's making him this way!

00:04:23.697 --> 00:04:24.664
Eggman...

00:04:25.332 --> 00:04:26.600
Dr. Eggman...

00:04:27.334 --> 00:04:29.269
My master.

00:04:35.142 --> 00:04:38.345
Beta. Delta. Epsilon.

00:04:38.345 --> 00:04:40.280
I won't let you!

00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:43.116
You saved my life.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.085
I was glad to do it!

00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:47.687
Just returning the favor.

00:04:47.687 --> 00:04:48.388
Friend.

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:49.790
[Chirping]

00:04:54.995 --> 00:04:56.029
Thank goodness you're okay!

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:58.431
I was afraid you'd never wake up!

00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:06.039
[Beeping]

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.974
Eggman not friend.

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:08.942
Delete.

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:10.310
Delete.

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:13.880
Must help friends.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.216
Must help them!

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.526
[Sparkling]

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.932
[Sparkling]

00:05:31.932 --> 00:05:34.100
Huh? What the-?

00:05:35.068 --> 00:05:36.036
Woah...

00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:37.871
Oh!

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.491
Huh...

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:05.699
[Squeaking]

00:06:21.882 --> 00:06:23.316
What's this?

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:27.387
A sea monster?

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:29.356
Kinda creepy.

00:06:29.356 --> 00:06:33.226
When anger and sadness
overflow like a mighty ocean,

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:34.928
beware the Great Calamity.

00:06:34.928 --> 00:06:37.097
Is there someone there? Come on out!

00:06:37.097 --> 00:06:38.498
I won't hurt ya.

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:40.433
Woah!

00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:46.940
Hey! What's goin' on?

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.875
Where am I?

00:06:52.913 --> 00:06:54.080
Huh!

00:06:57.584 --> 00:07:01.454
It's awful! How could Father
do something so terrible?

00:07:01.454 --> 00:07:03.390
[Crying]

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.058
No!

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:09.029
I must stop them!

00:07:09.496 --> 00:07:10.030
[Grunts with effort]

00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:11.665
Huh!

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:20.373
What did I just see?

00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:22.375
It couldn't have been a dream.

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:29.316
It's Eggman! What's that fathead
floatin' around here for?

00:07:29.316 --> 00:07:31.818
Well, there's only one way to find out!

00:07:37.223 --> 00:07:39.159
Time to pay a little visit!

00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:49.235
How rude!

00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:51.438
Doesn't that hedgehog know how to knock?

00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:53.707
[Alarms]

[Breaking glass]

00:07:55.942 --> 00:07:59.312
I'll have to teach our
little friend some manners.

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:00.680
There!

Wow, you really know how
to make a guy feel welcome!

[Lasers]

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:12.292
Have some more hospitality!

[Evil chuckle]

00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:21.534
Here, Sonic. Have a ball!

00:08:21.534 --> 00:08:23.370
Wo-oah..!

00:08:31.378 --> 00:08:33.847
I'll get you one of these days!

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:35.415
Augh!

00:08:35.415 --> 00:08:38.418
Oh, well. Guess I'm just too fast for ya!

00:08:39.285 --> 00:08:40.286
Ha!

00:08:40.453 --> 00:08:41.454
Wha-?

00:08:41.454 --> 00:08:42.789
Ha! I scared ya!

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:44.791
I scared ya! I scared ya!

00:08:44.791 --> 00:08:47.027
You'd scare anybody, Bokkun.

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:51.164
I've got another super important
message from Dr. Eggman himself!

00:08:51.164 --> 00:08:54.034
You'd better pay attention if
you know what's good for ya!

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.471
Alright, Sonic.

00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:02.075
The time has come for me to settle
my score with you once and for all.

00:09:02.075 --> 00:09:05.578
I think we need to have a man-to-hedgehog
chat in the lower chamber.

00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:08.481
My assistant Bokkun will show you the way.

00:09:09.449 --> 00:09:11.117
Make it snappy.

00:09:11.117 --> 00:09:13.086
Aww..!

00:09:13.086 --> 00:09:15.688
I have to do everything around here!

00:09:15.688 --> 00:09:17.157
[Cries]

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:25.432
This better not be another trick, Eggman!

00:09:25.432 --> 00:09:27.367
I'm through with tricks for today.

00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:28.835
Now listen well, hedgehog,

00:09:28.835 --> 00:09:31.171
because I've had just about enough of you!

00:09:31.171 --> 00:09:35.241
I have been trying to establish
my egg-quisitely evil empire,

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:37.911
but you have been nothing
but a thorn in my side.

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:40.113
Every brilliant plan I put into action

00:09:40.113 --> 00:09:44.384
has been systematically stymied by
you and your kindergarten cohorts!

00:09:44.884 --> 00:09:47.587
You have wrecked my wretched
plans far too often,

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:49.489
but you won't get in my way again.

00:09:49.489 --> 00:09:50.523
Do you hear me?

00:09:50.523 --> 00:09:53.193
Your threats aren't gonna
scare me off, Eggman!

00:09:53.193 --> 00:09:55.628
You really think you can get rid of me?

00:09:55.628 --> 00:09:56.896
I don't think I can,

00:09:56.896 --> 00:09:58.531
I know I can!

00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:02.836
[Lasers]

00:10:02.836 --> 00:10:03.903
Aah!

00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:05.972
Huh!

00:10:05.972 --> 00:10:07.440
You seem a bit jumpy.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.209
What's wrong? Can't take the heat?

I never heard of it.

got a dent in my database.

Am I malfunctioning, or are we back
in the middle of the Egg Carrier?

I think it is the Egg Carrier!

But how is that possible, Bocoe?

Simple! You see, the Egg Carrier
emits a very strong magnetic current.

That current, when combined
with the laws of gravity,
