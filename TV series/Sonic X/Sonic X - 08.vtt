WEBVTT

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:09.743
Perfect!

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:11.812
[Laughs evilly]

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:00.594
Go, go, go, go, go

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:02.129
Gotta go fast

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.331
Gotta go fast

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:07.367
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:12.439
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.241
Got ourselves a situation

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:16.543
Stuck in a new location

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:20.080
Without any explanation

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.215
No talk of relaxation

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:23.850
Don't, don't, don't

00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:25.619
Don't blink, don't think

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.454
Just go, go, go, go

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:28.922
Go, go

00:01:32.726 --> 00:01:34.461
Sonic is on the run

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:36.363
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:40.100
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:41.602
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:01:41.702 --> 00:01:43.604
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:46.173
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:48.075
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:50.444
Sonic X

00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:53.280
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.315
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:57.217
Sonic X

00:02:05.726 --> 00:02:08.996
MAN: What was that?
Some kind of rocket, maybe?

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.331
What's the word?

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:14.368
An unknown object was spotted
about five minutes ago.

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:16.570
I'm afraid
that's all we know, sir.

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:18.538
That Dr. Eggman
is up to something.

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:20.607
I only wish I knew what it was.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.448
Has it been identified?

00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:30.317
I'm afraid not, sir.

00:02:30.417 --> 00:02:32.319
Hmm.

00:02:35.956 --> 00:02:39.559
Well, now,
time to have a little fun.

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.771
Super Sweeper!

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:56.910
[Alarm sounds]

00:02:57.044 --> 00:02:58.178
What's going on?

00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:00.213
Communication is cut off!

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:02.049
Sir, the satellite.
It's...

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:03.316
Gone?

00:03:03.417 --> 00:03:04.151
Yes, sir.

00:03:04.251 --> 00:03:05.552
This can't be happening!

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:07.054
It's impossible!

00:03:12.092 --> 00:03:15.495
Just look at all
my shiny new toys.

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:17.197
Ah, well.

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:20.701
Too bad I have to grind them all
into robot parts.

00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:25.972
Who knew recycling could be so
much fun and cost effective?

00:03:27.074 --> 00:03:28.742
It's getting closer!

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:33.380
We've got to alert
the president!

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.783
You know what I like to do best,
boys and girls?

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.685
I like to dance!

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:42.255
Dancing is lots of fun,
and it's good exercise, too!

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:44.191
Hey, I've got an idea!

00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:46.293
Why don't you dance with me?

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:48.929
That's it!
Looking good!

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:49.930
Hi.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.832
Snack time, everyone.

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:55.969
Here we go.

00:03:56.436 --> 00:04:00.340
AMY: Ella showed me
how to make homemade apple pie.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.744
I think our little Amy
has quite a knack for baking.

00:04:03.844 --> 00:04:06.279
I just might
be out of a job soon.

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.250
Hey, Ella, maybe Sonic
would like some pie.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.085
He can have the other one.

00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:13.186
No, you don't.

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:14.721
That pie is for Sonic.

00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:17.124
No, me!

00:04:17.758 --> 00:04:20.160
Tails, you broke our TV.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.628
I'm sorry.

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:24.164
And that was
our favorite program.

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:25.832
Don't worry, Cream.

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:27.868
Maybe this will help.

00:04:28.668 --> 00:04:30.270
Okay.

00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:31.571
Guess that didn't work.

00:04:31.705 --> 00:04:33.473
[Crying]

00:04:33.573 --> 00:04:37.077
Now we can't watch our program!

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.111
Hmm?

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.781
Hey, what's going on?

00:04:40.881 --> 00:04:42.115
Hi, Sonic.

00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:45.118
Cream and Cheese are upset
'cause the TV is busted.

00:04:45.218 --> 00:04:47.420
That's what
they're crying about?

00:04:47.521 --> 00:04:48.588
Uh-huh.

00:04:48.688 --> 00:04:50.090
What do we do?

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.425
Now I can't watch
my cooking show.

00:04:52.526 --> 00:04:55.662
Or Mrs. Thorndyke
in the Movie of the Week.

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:58.231
Or the martial arts matinee.

00:04:58.331 --> 00:04:59.933
Sorry, Mr. Tanaka.

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:01.635
[Laughing]

00:05:09.576 --> 00:05:13.580
That was a disappointing welcome
if you don't mind me saying so.

00:05:14.848 --> 00:05:16.449
Got a brand-new message
for Sonic

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.052
from Dr. Eggman,
so listen up good.

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:21.388
Greetings, my little warthog!

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:23.990
Sorry it's been so long
since my last message,

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.426
but I've been
such a busy little bee!

00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:28.094
Take a look!

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:32.899
That thing
is swallowing up satellites!

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.602
And it's ruined
our television reception.

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:37.470
Don't get any ideas, Sonic.

00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:40.073
After all,
I'm only having a little fun.

00:05:40.207 --> 00:05:42.642
So stay out of it
if you know what's good for you.

00:05:42.742 --> 00:05:45.745
As we speak, my E-90 is floating
about the stratosphere,

00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:47.714
collecting all manner
of space junk

00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:49.382
so that I can make more and more

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:52.485
of my ever-so-helpful
mechanical friends.

00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:53.486
Well?

00:05:53.587 --> 00:05:55.488
What do you say to that?

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:58.091
[Laughs evilly]

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:00.493
Pretty soon you might be
obsolete, Bokkun.

00:06:00.594 --> 00:06:03.997
[Wails]

00:06:04.097 --> 00:06:05.932
What's E-90?

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:07.033
I don't know, Chris.

00:06:07.167 --> 00:06:09.603
But I'll bet
it's one of Dr. Eggman's robots.

00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:11.371
I wonder what a stratosphere is.

00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:13.740
A layer of air miles above us.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.776
It's as high as the sky!

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:20.814
We can do without you, crybaby.

00:06:20.914 --> 00:06:23.383
No!
Put me down!

00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:24.784
[Explosion]

00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:28.121
BOKKUN:
Gotcha! [Laughs]

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:30.790
Looks like that robot
is da bomb!

00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:33.226
CHUCK: Very funny.
But this is serious, Chris.

00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:36.296
Eggman is causing havoc
miles above anyone's reach.

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:38.798
I bet the Tornado
can get up there.

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:40.233
Hmm.

00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:41.768
Come on, Tails.

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:44.838
Why not?
I'm game.

00:06:44.938 --> 00:06:47.574
- Let's go.
- Okay, I'm coming.

00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:54.781
We can do it!

00:06:54.881 --> 00:06:56.082
You bet!

00:06:58.418 --> 00:06:59.753
Good luck, you guys.

00:06:59.853 --> 00:07:01.988
We'll be waiting.

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:03.490
Huh?

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.226
E-90, zap those meddlers!

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:14.567
Move in close!

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:18.939
We move too fast for it.

00:07:24.377 --> 00:07:26.146
I think that was too close.

00:07:26.246 --> 00:07:27.147
Don't worry.

00:07:27.247 --> 00:07:30.016
I think I've got an idea.

00:07:42.595 --> 00:07:44.731
[Moans]

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.069
Here goes!

00:08:01.081 --> 00:08:02.315
Stay with it!

00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:04.684
Just hold on tight!

00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:10.490
- Aah!
- Aah!

00:08:21.468 --> 00:08:24.170
Time for some fireworks.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.053
You think you're so smart,
don't you?

00:08:40.153 --> 00:08:42.389
Super Sweeper!

00:08:47.994 --> 00:08:49.662
It's sucking us in!

00:08:49.763 --> 00:08:52.132
[Grunting]

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:04.444
It's coming up behind us!

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.913
I know a way to shake it.

00:09:16.623 --> 00:09:17.924
I can't believe it!

00:09:18.024 --> 00:09:20.760
It's swallowing up
all the clouds!

00:09:21.628 --> 00:09:22.762
Oh, no!

00:09:22.862 --> 00:09:28.368
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.359
Hmm.

00:09:54.094 --> 00:09:57.931
It appears our foe is
more powerful than we thought.

00:09:58.798 --> 00:10:00.200
SONIC:
Hey, Tails.

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:01.701
Huh?

00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:04.070
Problem is
the Tornado is too slow,

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.173
so what you ought to do is
soup this birdy up a little bit.

00:10:07.307 --> 00:10:08.374
- Oh.
- Oh.

00:10:08.475 --> 00:10:09.909
I could try.

00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:11.444
Really, Tails?

00:10:11.544 --> 00:10:14.013
Maybe I could use
the Chaos Emerald.

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:15.815
But there could be a problem.

00:10:15.915 --> 00:10:17.317
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:10:18.051 --> 00:10:20.420
It's all that energy.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.690
The Chaos Emerald's
got huge amounts of energy.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.659
It would only take a tiny bit
to run the Tornado,

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:29.896
so all that extra energy
wouldn't have anywhere to go,

00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:32.532
and that could be
a real big problem.

00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:34.934
What do you think, Grandpa?

00:10:35.034 --> 00:10:38.771
We need to find a way to burn
off the Emerald's excess energy.

00:10:38.872 --> 00:10:41.141
I wouldn't want
to just waste it.

00:10:41.241 --> 00:10:43.209
Do you have any better ideas?

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:45.712
Well, we could install
a backup engine.

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:48.314
That way, with two engines
instead of one,

00:10:48.414 --> 00:10:50.717
the energy
would have another outlet.

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:54.754
Do you really think two engines
could contain all that power?

00:10:54.854 --> 00:10:59.125
If we want to beat Dr. Eggman,
it's sure worth giving it a try.

00:10:59.225 --> 00:11:02.862
In order to install that backup,
we'd have to rebuild the plane.

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:06.032
Are you sure you have
the know-how to do that, Tails?

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:08.935
Well, I've never
done anything like this before,

00:11:09.035 --> 00:11:10.336
but I'll give it a shot.

00:11:10.436 --> 00:11:11.704
You can do it, Tails.

00:11:11.804 --> 00:11:12.705
I know it.

00:11:12.805 --> 00:11:14.674
Come with me, Tails.

00:11:14.774 --> 00:11:17.443
I've got something
that might interest you.

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:22.182
In fact, I'm certain it will.

00:11:26.319 --> 00:11:27.554
What's this?

00:11:27.654 --> 00:11:30.423
It's my secret laboratory.

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:34.661
It's amazing!

00:11:34.794 --> 00:11:37.197
I think you'll find
everything we need.

00:11:37.297 --> 00:11:38.598
Sure!

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:41.201
Now let's rebuild the Tornado.

00:11:41.334 --> 00:11:42.669
Yeah!

00:11:47.273 --> 00:11:48.541
We'll connect it here.

00:11:48.641 --> 00:11:50.276
You mean like this?

00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:58.618
You've been working
all day, Tails.

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.053
Why don't you take a break?

00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:01.221
It's okay.

00:12:01.321 --> 00:12:02.822
I'm almost done.

00:12:02.922 --> 00:12:05.225
Hmm.
All right.

00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:08.228
Want some help?

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:26.946
Good morning!

00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:31.117
It's time for the one and only
Dr. Eggman Show!

00:12:31.217 --> 00:12:34.087
This program is coming to you
live via satellite

00:12:34.187 --> 00:12:36.990
from a beautiful island
in the Southern Sea.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.825
He's scary.

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:42.395
Today's show is brought to you
by the amazing Super Sweeper.

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:45.365
For a cleaner,
safer stratosphere.

00:12:45.465 --> 00:12:46.933
Cue.

00:12:47.066 --> 00:12:50.236
Who's the most brilliant
scientist in all the universe?

00:12:50.336 --> 00:12:53.039
[Laughs]

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.042
Why, it's Dr. Eggman!

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:01.180
Sir, the object appears
to have been launched.

00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:03.149
Then I'm afraid
we have no choice

00:13:03.249 --> 00:13:05.084
but to launch a counterattack.

00:13:05.184 --> 00:13:06.586
Yes, sir.

00:13:07.754 --> 00:13:09.722
TAILS:
Sonic!

00:13:11.157 --> 00:13:12.225
Did you finish?

00:13:12.325 --> 00:13:14.060
Yep, we sure did.

00:13:14.193 --> 00:13:16.129
Come on.
I'll show you.

00:13:29.676 --> 00:13:30.910
[Both gasp]

00:13:39.686 --> 00:13:43.189
TAILS:
Presenting Tornado X!

00:13:52.865 --> 00:13:54.767
Target lock on, sir.

00:13:57.337 --> 00:13:59.472
Fire laser!

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:11.851
What is happening?

00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:14.654
EGGMAN: A feeble attempt,
at best, my friends.

00:14:14.754 --> 00:14:16.089
Come on, Super Sweeper!

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:18.124
Do your stuff!

00:14:22.495 --> 00:14:24.230
Let's shove off, Tails.

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:27.266
Hey, Sonic, I was hoping
I could go, too.

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:29.068
Chris, you can't come with us.

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:31.571
You know the plane
is only a two-seater.

00:14:31.671 --> 00:14:32.872
I thought...

00:14:33.473 --> 00:14:35.441
Guess I forgot to tell you.

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:38.211
I made a couple of more changes.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:44.283
I asked Tails if he could
put in an extra seat.

00:14:44.851 --> 00:14:47.186
I hope you don't mind, Sonic.

00:14:47.787 --> 00:14:49.555
Well, Sonic?

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:55.228
Just so long as you don't
get in the way, okay?

00:14:55.328 --> 00:14:56.863
You got a deal.

00:15:01.167 --> 00:15:04.270
Tornado X, ready for takeoff.

00:15:05.538 --> 00:15:07.907
Let's clear the runway.

00:15:14.113 --> 00:15:15.815
I can't wait!

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:18.718
I'm so excited, I could fly!

00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:24.657
Tornado X, blast off!

00:15:29.962 --> 00:15:31.330
Here we go!

00:15:35.168 --> 00:15:36.869
Okay, get ready.

00:15:37.003 --> 00:15:40.540
We're about to enter
X hyperspeed mode.

00:15:46.579 --> 00:15:48.748
Sorry to disturb you,
Dr. Eggman,

00:15:48.848 --> 00:15:52.485
but something is headed straight
for E-90, and it sure is fast.

00:15:52.585 --> 00:15:54.687
But not fast enough.

00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:57.957
I'll teach them
to sneak up on me.

00:16:05.264 --> 00:16:07.400
Let's do it!

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:24.550
TAILS: Don't worry, Sonic!
I've got your back!

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.052
Thanks, Tails.

00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:27.887
Sonic!

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:31.290
I'll put an end
to that hyperactive hedgehog!

00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:39.298
I can't get any closer!

00:16:49.141 --> 00:16:50.510
Whoa!

00:16:51.611 --> 00:16:54.714
Isn't Sonic the bravest?

00:17:14.133 --> 00:17:16.235
Now try and top that.

00:17:20.573 --> 00:17:21.807
Here we go.

00:17:21.908 --> 00:17:23.643
Booster switch on!

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.092
TAILS:
Sonic, watch out!

00:17:43.129 --> 00:17:44.597
All right!

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.233
You want to fight dirty?

00:17:50.636 --> 00:17:52.505
Just try to get away!

00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:02.348
Sonic looks like he's shivering.

00:18:02.448 --> 00:18:05.318
That's 'cause we're close
to the stratosphere.

00:18:05.885 --> 00:18:08.654
It's 50 below up here,
but Sonic can take it.

00:18:08.788 --> 00:18:10.289
Huh?

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:15.995
What's going on?

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:18.631
Everything is A-okay!

00:18:21.801 --> 00:18:23.903
A-okay.

00:18:24.003 --> 00:18:24.904
Huh?

00:18:25.004 --> 00:18:27.907
Tails, Sonic is frozen solid.

00:18:31.777 --> 00:18:33.579
Hey!
The ring!

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:34.880
No good.

00:18:34.981 --> 00:18:37.350
I can't open the cockpit.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.819
But we've got to think
of something!

00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:41.153
CHUCK:
We need to find a way

00:18:41.253 --> 00:18:44.023
to burn off
the Emerald's excess energy.

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:45.224
That's it!

00:18:45.358 --> 00:18:46.692
I've got an idea.

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:48.594
Listen carefully, Chris.

00:18:48.728 --> 00:18:51.497
Take the ring and connect it
to the yellow cable

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:53.633
underneath the seat.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.202
What's that going to do?

00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:58.270
There's no time for questions!

00:18:58.371 --> 00:18:59.405
Okay.

00:19:06.178 --> 00:19:06.912
Aah!

00:19:08.748 --> 00:19:10.650
Aah! Aah!

00:19:12.251 --> 00:19:13.886
Ugh!

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:15.655
Aah!

00:19:31.103 --> 00:19:32.338
Watch out, Eggman.

00:19:32.438 --> 00:19:33.973
I'm all warmed up.

00:19:34.073 --> 00:19:35.341
Let's go get them, guys.

00:19:35.441 --> 00:19:36.776
Yeah!

00:19:52.058 --> 00:19:53.659
- All right!
- Yeah!

00:20:01.901 --> 00:20:04.170
Guess I need to call
the cable guy.

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:16.182
[Laughter]

00:20:20.252 --> 00:20:22.755
Sonic, I made
my caliente chili for you.

00:20:22.888 --> 00:20:26.192
This will make your tummy
nice and warm.

00:20:26.292 --> 00:20:28.627
You sure taught Eggman
a lesson, Sonic.

00:20:28.761 --> 00:20:30.096
It wasn't me, Chuck.

00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:31.997
I just helped out this time.

00:20:32.131 --> 00:20:34.200
Chris and Tails
are the ones that did it.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.102
They're the real heroes.

00:20:36.202 --> 00:20:37.636
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:39.004
AMY:
Let's celebrate.

00:20:39.105 --> 00:20:42.742
I made this ice cream myself
for the coolest guy around.

00:20:42.842 --> 00:20:44.610
Uh...

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:46.612
Wow! Cool!
