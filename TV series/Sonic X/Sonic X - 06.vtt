[Screeching]

00:00:29.997 --> 00:00:31.265
Hey, where did you go?

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:33.267
Just out.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:38.939
[Sighs]
He's so mysterious.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.674
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:42.209
Gotta go fast

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:44.411
Gotta go fast

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:47.447
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:52.519
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:54.321
Got ourselves a situation

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:56.623
Stuck in a new location

00:00:56.723 --> 00:01:00.193
Without any explanation

00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:02.296
No talk of relaxation

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:03.931
Don't, don't, don't

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:05.699
Don't blink, don't think

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:07.534
Just go, go, go, go

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:09.002
Go, go

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:14.541
Sonic is on the run

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:16.443
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:20.180
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.682
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:26.253
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:28.155
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:30.524
Sonic X

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:33.360
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:35.395
Gotta go faster, faster,

MR. TANAKA:
Thorndyke residence.

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:51.254
Very good, sir.

00:01:51.354 --> 00:01:53.857
Your father has requested
that I inform you

00:01:53.957 --> 00:01:56.326
he and your mother will be
stopping by for a visit

00:01:56.426 --> 00:01:57.994
this afternoon.

00:01:58.094 --> 00:02:00.297
Wow, Ella!
They're coming to see me!

00:02:00.397 --> 00:02:01.932
What a nice surprise.

00:02:02.032 --> 00:02:03.733
It's not even my birthday!

00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:05.969
Uh-oh.

00:02:07.103 --> 00:02:08.605
Is there something wrong?

00:02:08.705 --> 00:02:12.008
No, I'm all done.
Can I go now?

00:02:12.142 --> 00:02:13.710
Yes, go ahead.

00:02:13.844 --> 00:02:15.212
See you later!

00:02:15.312 --> 00:02:16.646
Hmm?

00:02:16.746 --> 00:02:17.714
Oh.

00:02:18.381 --> 00:02:21.151
Something is up.

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:38.768
I've got to go to school,

00:02:38.902 --> 00:02:40.804
so I'm counting on you
to stay out of sight

00:02:40.904 --> 00:02:42.505
when my parents show up.

00:02:42.606 --> 00:02:44.941
Gotcha.
No problem.

00:02:45.075 --> 00:02:47.711
Yeah, sure.
You can count on us.

00:02:47.811 --> 00:02:49.212
It won't be for long.

00:02:49.312 --> 00:02:50.914
Mom and Dad's visits
have to be short

00:02:51.047 --> 00:02:53.383
because they both have
busy schedules.

00:02:55.785 --> 00:02:58.288
Hey, Sonic.

00:02:58.388 --> 00:02:59.956
Is he mad at me?

00:03:00.056 --> 00:03:01.124
Don't mind him.

00:03:01.224 --> 00:03:02.259
Get going, Chris.

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.262
You'll be late for school
if you don't hurry up.

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:07.464
Wahh!

00:03:11.001 --> 00:03:12.369
- [Crash]
- I'm okay!

00:03:12.502 --> 00:03:13.970
[Sighing]

00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:18.475
Chris sure is happy about
his folks' visit, huh, Chuck?

00:03:18.608 --> 00:03:20.744
Mm-hmm.
He is.

00:03:20.877 --> 00:03:22.112
What do they do?

00:03:22.212 --> 00:03:25.849
Chris' dad is president
of a huge software company.

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.084
He spends most of his time
at the office

00:03:28.184 --> 00:03:30.487
or traveling on business.

00:03:30.587 --> 00:03:32.255
And what about his mom?

00:03:32.355 --> 00:03:34.457
She's a star.

00:03:34.557 --> 00:03:39.029
A famous actress who jets all
around the world making movies.

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:40.764
I bet it's pretty tough
for Chris

00:03:40.864 --> 00:03:43.366
not having his parents around
most of the time.

00:03:43.466 --> 00:03:44.200
Yes.

00:03:44.301 --> 00:03:46.136
He must miss them.

00:04:07.757 --> 00:04:10.760
[Growls]
I've got to think of something!

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:11.661
Nah.

00:04:11.761 --> 00:04:13.730
[Growls]

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.399
I've got to think of a way
to conquer this planet!

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:18.335
Perhaps the children.

00:04:18.435 --> 00:04:21.571
Maybe one of my robots could
brainwash the school kiddies

00:04:21.705 --> 00:04:24.541
so that they'd love me
and look up to me as a hero,

00:04:24.674 --> 00:04:26.076
and they could persuade
their parents

00:04:26.176 --> 00:04:27.911
to accept me as their ruler.

00:04:28.044 --> 00:04:30.380
Here are your choices.

00:04:31.081 --> 00:04:32.849
Let's see.

00:04:35.652 --> 00:04:38.121
This is a tough one.

00:04:38.221 --> 00:04:40.924
I'll let the machine decide.

00:04:46.463 --> 00:04:47.998
Perfect!

00:05:19.829 --> 00:05:21.765
That doesn't even make sense!

00:05:21.865 --> 00:05:23.700
I don't even know
where to start.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.036
I'm totally lost.

00:05:26.136 --> 00:05:28.271
- Should we wake him up?
- No, don't!

00:05:28.405 --> 00:05:30.740
Then he'll put us to sleep.

00:05:30.874 --> 00:05:33.343
My, my, what
an intelligent-Iooking class!

00:05:33.476 --> 00:05:34.444
Huh?

00:05:34.544 --> 00:05:38.181
Oh, perhaps I've arrived
during nap time.

00:05:38.248 --> 00:05:39.682
I'm sorry.
What are you?

00:05:39.783 --> 00:05:43.553
Hmm, I'll give you
three guesses, young man.

00:05:44.354 --> 00:05:45.655
You're a robot.

00:05:45.755 --> 00:05:47.357
A robot teacher!

00:05:47.457 --> 00:05:49.392
Hmm.
Goodbye.

00:05:49.492 --> 00:05:50.794
I'm taking over.

00:05:50.894 --> 00:05:53.129
You are?

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:54.397
I am.

00:05:54.497 --> 00:05:56.132
How's that?

00:05:56.232 --> 00:05:57.133
Oh!

00:06:01.604 --> 00:06:03.740
They're replacing me
with a robot, huh?

00:06:03.873 --> 00:06:06.409
Wait till I give that principal
a piece of my mind!

00:06:06.543 --> 00:06:08.311
[Growls]

00:06:12.982 --> 00:06:14.184
Delicious.

00:06:16.886 --> 00:06:18.721
How dare you?
Oh.

00:06:21.724 --> 00:06:24.294
I'm glad to know
you never hired that robot.

00:06:24.394 --> 00:06:26.529
My students
will be relieved, too.

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:27.964
[Laughter]

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.937
And that's how to crack
an equation.

00:06:34.037 --> 00:06:38.341
Mathematics is a breeze when you
keep your eye on the "PI."

00:06:38.475 --> 00:06:40.710
Now it's starting to make sense.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.412
It's easy.

00:06:42.545 --> 00:06:43.446
All right!

00:06:43.546 --> 00:06:46.850
- Yeah!
- Wow!

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.885
He's great.

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:52.122
That robot is a great teacher.

00:06:52.222 --> 00:06:56.159
Sit in on his class
and study his technique.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.130
[Whines]
But, sir.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.632
[Laughter]

00:07:02.732 --> 00:07:06.736
Thank you, class.
It's an honor to teach you.

00:07:06.836 --> 00:07:08.838
There's something fishy here.

00:07:08.972 --> 00:07:11.941
I'd better check this out
with headquarters.

00:07:27.891 --> 00:07:28.658
Come in.

00:07:28.758 --> 00:07:31.027
This is Chalkboard Charlie
calling Homeroom

00:07:31.127 --> 00:07:32.962
with a Code Red priority alert.

00:07:33.062 --> 00:07:34.497
Let me get this straight.

00:07:34.597 --> 00:07:37.133
You want us to send out
our land, sea, and air forces

00:07:37.233 --> 00:07:39.602
because a robot kicked you
out of your classroom?

00:07:39.702 --> 00:07:42.038
Roger.
I'll transmit my coordinates.

00:07:49.546 --> 00:07:51.114
[Laughs]

00:07:51.247 --> 00:07:53.183
Wait till Control hears this!

00:07:53.316 --> 00:07:55.385
[Moans]

00:07:58.588 --> 00:08:00.957
Seems like we're having
technical difficulties.

00:08:01.057 --> 00:08:03.593
I'll have to go to the police.

00:08:07.697 --> 00:08:10.600
So you were assaulted by a robot
who took over your class,

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.169
and now he's holding
all your students prisoner?

00:08:13.303 --> 00:08:14.170
Stay right there.

00:08:14.304 --> 00:08:17.273
I'll be over in a jiff
to investigate.

00:08:18.208 --> 00:08:20.710
Where is that cop?
He's late.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:21.911
- Hmm?
- [Siren wailing]

00:08:22.512 --> 00:08:24.447
Well, finally!

00:08:24.547 --> 00:08:27.717
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

00:08:29.219 --> 00:08:32.488
Come on, officer!
The kids are in danger!

00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:34.624
Let's move it!

00:08:35.325 --> 00:08:38.828
Just remember.
The robot's dangerous.

00:08:41.898 --> 00:08:43.132
[Gasps]

00:08:43.233 --> 00:08:46.836
That mechanical menace
kidnapped the kids!

00:08:50.139 --> 00:08:52.008
I've always wanted to play
baseball.

00:08:52.108 --> 00:08:53.376
Shall we?

00:08:53.476 --> 00:08:55.445
[Cheering]

00:08:57.981 --> 00:09:02.685
Well, what are we waiting for?
Play ball!

00:09:02.785 --> 00:09:04.887
Throw it to me!

00:09:04.988 --> 00:09:05.688
Over here!

00:09:05.788 --> 00:09:07.123
Right there.

00:09:07.223 --> 00:09:08.091
You knock it down,

00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:10.426
and I'll attempt to disable
its power supply.

00:09:10.526 --> 00:09:12.996
There's no time to lose.

00:09:14.163 --> 00:09:17.433
Remember to keep your wrist
relaxed all through the pitch,

00:09:17.533 --> 00:09:18.534
like so.

00:09:18.668 --> 00:09:19.335
You see?

00:09:19.469 --> 00:09:21.804
Doesn't seem like those kids
are in danger to me.

00:09:21.938 --> 00:09:24.040
It looks like
they're having a great time.

00:09:24.173 --> 00:09:27.310
I wish I was out there playing.

00:09:27.443 --> 00:09:30.380
Stop pigging out and arrest him!

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.181
Hey!

00:09:32.248 --> 00:09:35.885
I'm nailing you
for burger burglary!

00:09:35.985 --> 00:09:38.488
Drop that sandwich, scumbo!

00:09:43.092 --> 00:09:44.360
[Growls]

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.828
I wonder if Inteligente

00:09:45.928 --> 00:09:47.964
has successfully brainwashed
those brats

00:09:48.097 --> 00:09:49.599
into admiring me yet.

00:09:49.699 --> 00:09:52.702
I'd better look
and see how it's going.

00:09:54.103 --> 00:09:56.005
Ugh!
What's this?

00:09:56.105 --> 00:09:57.640
I'm ready!

00:09:57.774 --> 00:09:59.475
Put it over the plate!

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:03.513
You can do it!
Throw the curve ball!

00:10:08.785 --> 00:10:11.487
Whoa!
Look at it go!

00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:18.127
Mr. Inteligente is amazing.

00:10:18.227 --> 00:10:21.097
My first home run!
How thrilling!

00:10:21.197 --> 00:10:24.600
Baseball is such
an exhilarating activity.

00:10:38.448 --> 00:10:41.751
Inteligente sure is a hit
with his students.

00:10:41.851 --> 00:10:42.852
They love him.

00:10:42.952 --> 00:10:46.022
He's supposed to make
those kids love me,

00:10:46.122 --> 00:10:48.725
not himself.

00:11:12.915 --> 00:11:14.417
- Welcome home.
- Welcome home.

00:11:14.517 --> 00:11:16.419
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:11:17.754 --> 00:11:19.489
Lindsey, Nelson.

00:11:19.589 --> 00:11:21.190
Good to see you, Dad.

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:22.725
Hello, Father.

00:11:22.825 --> 00:11:24.894
How is everything going
here at home?

00:11:24.994 --> 00:11:27.730
Wonderfully well, now that
the two of you are here.

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:30.633
When does Chris get back
from school?

00:11:37.974 --> 00:11:40.376
Chris' dad
seems like a nice guy.

00:11:40.476 --> 00:11:44.414
His mom is really pretty.
Don't you think so, Sonic?

00:11:44.547 --> 00:11:45.681
Hmm.

00:11:45.782 --> 00:11:47.250
Oh.

00:11:48.785 --> 00:11:51.187
- Yay!
- Go, Danny!

00:11:51.287 --> 00:11:53.189
Knock it out!

00:11:53.289 --> 00:11:54.857
Wow, nice shot!

00:11:54.957 --> 00:11:56.426
That one's gone!

00:12:04.534 --> 00:12:06.669
That's the greatest catch ever.

00:12:06.803 --> 00:12:08.204
Huh?

00:12:08.304 --> 00:12:11.174
Whoa!
He's cool.

00:12:12.809 --> 00:12:14.210
Well, well, well,

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:17.713
seems the old retro-thrusters
aren't as rusty as I thought.

00:12:17.814 --> 00:12:19.682
[Laughs]

00:12:19.782 --> 00:12:21.951
Reminds me of my early days
on the cricket field

00:12:22.051 --> 00:12:23.920
when I was little bigger
than a laptop.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:24.921
[Laughs]

00:12:25.021 --> 00:12:26.689
Message for you.

00:12:26.789 --> 00:12:27.924
Bokkun!

00:12:28.024 --> 00:12:30.660
Dr. Eggman has
a message for you.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.528
Hmm?
A message?

00:12:32.628 --> 00:12:35.298
How'd you like to visit
the junkyard?

00:12:35.398 --> 00:12:37.333
Do you mean he's miffed at me?

00:12:37.433 --> 00:12:38.801
Sure, the doc's angry.

00:12:38.901 --> 00:12:41.003
Those kids are supposed
to get stuck on him,

00:12:41.103 --> 00:12:42.839
not you, bucketbrain.

00:12:42.972 --> 00:12:45.475
That used to be my mission.

00:12:45.608 --> 00:12:46.809
Huh?

00:12:47.844 --> 00:12:49.011
Aah!

00:12:49.111 --> 00:12:51.180
I'm afraid all that's changed.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.515
Huh?
How come?

00:12:52.615 --> 00:12:56.385
I was sent here to make these
students admire Dr. Eggman,

00:12:56.486 --> 00:12:58.221
but I found it
far more rewarding

00:12:58.321 --> 00:13:00.022
to be admired myself.

00:13:00.122 --> 00:13:02.525
What?
You blow a circuit or something?

00:13:02.625 --> 00:13:04.126
Don't you know Dr. Eggman

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.897
will turn you into scrap
metal, you barrel of bolts?

00:13:08.798 --> 00:13:11.567
Mr. Inteligente,
what's going on?

00:13:11.701 --> 00:13:13.836
Dr. Eggman may do with me
as he wishes,

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:17.206
but I refuse to abandon
the students in my charge.

00:13:17.306 --> 00:13:19.709
You're the greatest teacher
I know.

00:13:19.809 --> 00:13:23.212
I wish all teachers
were as great as you are.

00:13:23.312 --> 00:13:24.447
Me too.

00:13:24.547 --> 00:13:25.882
Same here.

00:13:25.982 --> 00:13:28.651
Oh, thank you.

00:13:28.751 --> 00:13:31.120
That's wonderful.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.522
[Crying]

00:13:34.223 --> 00:13:38.261
Stop crying and teach those
kids to admire Dr. Eggman!

00:13:38.361 --> 00:13:40.630
[Cries]
Now I'm crying.

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:41.797
He lost it.

00:13:41.898 --> 00:13:43.132
That crybaby.

00:13:43.232 --> 00:13:45.368
[Growls]

00:13:45.501 --> 00:13:48.471
Ha!
They should like me!

00:13:48.571 --> 00:13:49.539
[Growls]

00:13:49.672 --> 00:13:51.807
[Bell ringing]

00:13:53.743 --> 00:13:56.479
I'll see you all tomorrow,
class.

00:13:56.579 --> 00:13:58.981
- See ya!
- Bye-bye!

00:13:59.549 --> 00:14:01.918
I've got to hurry home now,
guys.

00:14:02.018 --> 00:14:03.519
Yeah?
How come?

00:14:03.619 --> 00:14:05.955
'Cause my mom and dad
are coming home for a visit.

00:14:06.055 --> 00:14:08.157
See ya!

00:14:08.257 --> 00:14:09.525
Huh?

00:14:09.625 --> 00:14:10.526
Aah!

00:14:15.631 --> 00:14:17.033
Inteligente.

00:14:17.133 --> 00:14:19.769
Aah! Oh, my hard drive,
it's you!

00:14:19.902 --> 00:14:22.471
I bet you think you're smart
for disobeying my orders,

00:14:22.605 --> 00:14:25.908
you transistorized traitor,
but I'll fix you.

00:14:26.008 --> 00:14:27.109
Oh!

00:14:27.243 --> 00:14:30.913
No, please don't disassemble me!

00:14:31.013 --> 00:14:32.748
Chris, help me get away!

00:14:32.848 --> 00:14:33.883
Huh?

00:14:33.983 --> 00:14:36.118
But what about what
you said a few minutes ago

00:14:36.218 --> 00:14:37.954
when you swore
you'd never abandon us

00:14:38.054 --> 00:14:40.756
no matter what Dr. Eggman
threatened to do to you?

00:14:40.856 --> 00:14:42.858
I really said, "No matter what"?

00:14:42.959 --> 00:14:44.360
You did.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.095
We all heard it.

00:14:46.195 --> 00:14:49.098
I suppose there's no way
around it then.

00:14:49.198 --> 00:14:51.500
What was I thinking?

00:14:51.601 --> 00:14:53.336
[Laughs]

00:14:53.469 --> 00:14:54.904
What's so funny?

00:14:55.004 --> 00:14:56.205
You don't really believe

00:14:56.305 --> 00:14:59.575
that sniveling circuit box
plans to keep his promise?

00:14:59.675 --> 00:15:01.811
I'm ordering him to keep you
in detention,

00:15:01.911 --> 00:15:04.780
where you'll be forced
to respect me.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.048
No way.

00:15:06.148 --> 00:15:07.550
What a snake!

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:10.820
Listen, robot, unless you want
to end up in a scrap heap,

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.855
you'll follow my orders.

00:15:12.955 --> 00:15:14.757
Sir!

00:15:14.857 --> 00:15:18.861
I'm not staying.
I've got to go home.

00:15:19.595 --> 00:15:21.864
Not so fast.

00:15:22.331 --> 00:15:24.133
You'll stay in detention
with the rest

00:15:24.233 --> 00:15:26.969
till Dr. Eggman dismisses you.

00:15:34.644 --> 00:15:36.812
I wonder what's keeping Chris.

00:15:36.912 --> 00:15:38.514
He knows you two
are here to see him.

00:15:38.614 --> 00:15:40.983
What if there's been
an accident?

00:15:41.083 --> 00:15:45.287
I'm sure my security people
would find out and contact me.

00:15:45.388 --> 00:15:46.656
You're right.

00:15:46.756 --> 00:15:48.491
He's probably playing
with his friends

00:15:48.591 --> 00:15:51.227
and simply hasn't noticed
the time.

00:15:51.327 --> 00:15:53.229
ELLA:
I wonder what's keeping Chris.

00:15:53.329 --> 00:15:55.464
Dinner's almost ready.

00:15:55.598 --> 00:15:57.600
Perhaps I should go
and look for him.

00:15:57.733 --> 00:16:00.102
You know the Thorndykes
don't want Chris babied

00:16:00.202 --> 00:16:02.071
or treated different
from other kids.

00:16:02.171 --> 00:16:04.106
I'm sure he's fine.

00:16:06.275 --> 00:16:07.977
I'm going to look for the boy.

00:16:08.077 --> 00:16:11.213
Nelson, have some faith
in your son.

00:16:11.313 --> 00:16:13.115
Huh?
Right.

00:16:13.215 --> 00:16:14.383
He's a level-headed boy,

00:16:14.483 --> 00:16:17.153
and I'm sure there's
a good reason why he's late.

00:16:17.253 --> 00:16:19.689
We have to stay calm!

00:16:19.789 --> 00:16:22.692
[Thinking] He hasn't changed
since he was a boy.

00:16:23.492 --> 00:16:25.194
I'm getting worried now, too.

00:16:25.294 --> 00:16:26.128
Hey, Sonic!

00:16:26.228 --> 00:16:28.264
Could you go look?

00:16:29.098 --> 00:16:30.700
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:16:42.311 --> 00:16:43.746
For today's art class,

00:16:43.846 --> 00:16:47.183
we will sketch the illustrious
figure of the great Dr. Eggman.

00:16:47.283 --> 00:16:49.251
As you draw, take special note

00:16:49.351 --> 00:16:52.455
of the doctor's noble visage
and dignified bearing.

00:16:52.555 --> 00:16:55.624
Does this pose inspire you?

00:16:55.725 --> 00:16:57.960
How about something
more dynamic?

00:16:58.094 --> 00:17:00.863
Ugh. It doesn't matter
how Eggman stands.

00:17:00.996 --> 00:17:02.832
He'll always look terrible.

00:17:04.767 --> 00:17:05.434
Huh?

00:17:05.568 --> 00:17:07.536
Whoa!

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:09.138
Huh?

00:17:09.271 --> 00:17:11.006
Hey, what was that?

00:17:11.107 --> 00:17:12.041
Wha...

00:17:13.442 --> 00:17:16.345
Perhaps a pose like a champion.

00:17:16.445 --> 00:17:18.080
You mean a chump!

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.381
You're so busy showing off,

00:17:19.482 --> 00:17:22.284
you haven't noticed
we're under attack!

00:17:25.521 --> 00:17:28.924
I always knew
you were a poser, Eggman.

00:17:29.391 --> 00:17:30.392
Inteligente!

00:17:30.493 --> 00:17:31.293
Yes, sir.

00:17:31.393 --> 00:17:33.295
Get rid of Sonic.

00:17:33.395 --> 00:17:34.630
- Who's Sonic?
- Who's Sonic?

00:17:34.764 --> 00:17:35.698
[Gasps]

00:17:35.798 --> 00:17:39.201
Yes, sir.
Whatever you say!

00:18:12.201 --> 00:18:13.202
Wow!

00:18:13.335 --> 00:18:14.436
He's tough.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.706
Here, Sonic.
Your prize.

00:18:19.708 --> 00:18:21.177
What prize?

00:18:21.277 --> 00:18:24.613
A little reward
for your victory.

00:18:26.482 --> 00:18:28.717
I don't want a booby prize.

00:18:28.818 --> 00:18:30.753
Fine.
You take it.

00:18:30.853 --> 00:18:33.322
No, thanks.
Keep it.

00:18:33.422 --> 00:18:36.358
Yuck.
Who'd want that?

00:18:36.458 --> 00:18:37.760
Nasty.

00:18:37.893 --> 00:18:40.296
All right, I'll wear it myself.

00:18:40.396 --> 00:18:42.064
Bye.

00:18:45.401 --> 00:18:46.702
He's a weirdo.

00:18:46.836 --> 00:18:47.736
Yeah.

00:18:47.837 --> 00:18:50.005
He could keep me after school
for a million years,

00:18:50.105 --> 00:18:52.308
and I still wouldn't admire him.

00:18:52.408 --> 00:18:55.611
You better hurry home, Chris.
Your parents are waiting.

00:18:55.711 --> 00:18:58.280
Yeah, that's right.

00:19:00.416 --> 00:19:01.784
He's so cool.

00:19:01.884 --> 00:19:03.819
He sure is.

00:19:11.427 --> 00:19:13.495
Maybe there's more
to being a schoolteacher

00:19:13.596 --> 00:19:17.566
than just passing out homework
and taking naps in class.

00:19:18.534 --> 00:19:21.470
Enjoying my burger, bub?

00:19:24.707 --> 00:19:27.643
Hey, get back here!
Stop chewing, you thief!

00:19:27.743 --> 00:19:31.580
One more nibble, and I'll
call out the S.W.A.T. Team!

00:19:38.687 --> 00:19:41.090
Hey, Mom and Dad, I'm home!

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:42.558
Oh!

00:19:42.658 --> 00:19:43.325
It's Chris!

00:19:43.425 --> 00:19:45.895
[Laughter]

00:19:45.995 --> 00:19:46.829
Son.

00:19:46.929 --> 00:19:49.098
Oh, my, I was so worried.

00:19:49.198 --> 00:19:51.267
I told your mother
you could look after yourself,

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.501
but she wouldn't listen.

00:19:52.635 --> 00:19:55.604
Sorry.
I got held up at school.

00:19:55.704 --> 00:19:57.506
[Dad laughs]

00:19:57.606 --> 00:19:59.909
Of course, I knew there was
absolutely nothing

00:20:00.009 --> 00:20:00.976
to worry about.

00:20:01.076 --> 00:20:02.378
When I was your age,

00:20:02.478 --> 00:20:05.214
I was kept after school
a few times myself.

00:20:05.314 --> 00:20:06.448
[Laughs]

00:20:06.548 --> 00:20:09.018
Oh, I'm sure Chris
is better behaved

00:20:09.118 --> 00:20:11.520
than you were, dear.

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:13.322
That's for sure.

00:20:13.422 --> 00:20:16.959
Actually, Chris, your father was
more worried about your absence

00:20:17.059 --> 00:20:18.294
than he lets on.

00:20:18.394 --> 00:20:19.628
Wasn't he, Tanaka?

00:20:19.728 --> 00:20:21.997
Well, Mr. Thorndyke
was concerned enough

00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:23.699
to phone the president.

00:20:23.799 --> 00:20:26.201
And Mrs. Thorndyke
called all the TV networks

00:20:26.335 --> 00:20:28.337
to get a bulletin
on the nightly news.

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:31.674
Oh, I didn't call all of them.

00:20:32.741 --> 00:20:34.944
The Thorndykes seem like
a real nice family,

00:20:35.044 --> 00:20:36.078
don't they, Amy?

00:20:36.178 --> 00:20:38.447
I'm glad Chris made it
back home in time.

00:20:38.547 --> 00:20:39.415
Uh-huh.

00:20:39.515 --> 00:20:42.484
It always feels good
to get back home.

00:20:46.388 --> 00:20:47.756
Hmm.
