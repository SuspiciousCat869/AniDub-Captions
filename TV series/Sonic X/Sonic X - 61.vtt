00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.668
Last time on Sonic X,

00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:02.869
Chris had a strange dream,

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:04.237
and was shocked when
a familiar figure

00:00:04.237 --> 00:00:06.106
emerged from the
shadows of his past.

00:00:06.106 --> 00:00:07.274
On Dr. Eggman's ship,

00:00:07.274 --> 00:00:09.209
Rouge made a grab for
the Chaos Emerald,

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:10.577
but got caught red-handed.

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:11.811
To her surprise,

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:13.513
she learned that Dr. Eggman
had an even more valuable

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:15.081
treasure locked away in a capsule.

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:16.216
Meanwhile, the Blue Typhoon

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:18.518
landed on a barren and
mysterious planet.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:20.554
As Sonic and his friends
explore the ancient ruins

00:00:20.554 --> 00:00:22.122
of a long, lost alien race,

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:24.124
they were ambushed by the Metarex!

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:25.425
To our heroes horror,

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:28.328
their trip quickly turned into a
nightmarish battle for survival.

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.363
Not even the firepower
of the Blue Typhoon

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:32.232
could overcome this fantastic foe.

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:33.667
But just when all appeared lost,

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:35.735
Sonic and company got
a blast from the past,

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:38.438
as Shadow the Hedgehog
suddenly came to the rescue.

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:39.739
Before they could
thank him, however,

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.108
he snatched up their Chaos
Emeralds and vanished.

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:43.610
Now the crew of the Blue Typhoon

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.580
are struggling to understand their
shocking encounter with Shadow.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.014
Where will Shadow show up next?

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:50.650
Has he returned to fight
beside Sonic, or against him?

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.819
Find out next on Sonic X!

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:54.588
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:57.691
Gotta go fast

00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:00.627
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:06.433
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:08.468
Got ourselves a situation

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:10.503
Stuck in a new location

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:14.107
Without any explanation

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:16.209
No talk of relaxation

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:17.844
Don't, don't, don't

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:19.646
Don't blink, don't think

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:21.448
Just go, go, go, go

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:22.949
Go, go

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.488
Sonic is on the run

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:30.390
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.094
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:37.797
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:01:37.797 --> 00:01:40.200
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.068
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:44.604
Sonic X

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:46.506
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.342
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:50.377
Sonic X

00:01:55.068 --> 00:01:57.003
The Metarex are attacking!

00:01:57.003 --> 00:01:59.906
We must do whatever it
takes to protect the base!

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:07.881
Aah!

00:02:07.881 --> 00:02:09.616
It's Scarship!

00:02:09.616 --> 00:02:10.650
Aah!

00:02:11.618 --> 00:02:13.019
Do not retreat!

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.521
Keep firing!

00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:15.989
[Lasers firing]

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.459
[Explosions]

00:02:25.465 --> 00:02:26.733
Attention all ships.

00:02:26.733 --> 00:02:28.034
Fire laser cannons now.

00:02:28.034 --> 00:02:31.104
[Lasers blasting]

00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:42.182
[Explosions]

00:02:42.182 --> 00:02:44.117
All ships retreat!

00:02:44.117 --> 00:02:45.185
Gahhh!!!

00:02:45.652 --> 00:02:48.088
Only a coward would
flee from combat.

00:02:48.088 --> 00:02:50.957
This is Dark Oak calling Scarship.

00:02:50.957 --> 00:02:52.192
Scarship here.

00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:53.460
You have a new mission.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.629
Sonic the Hedgehog and Dr. Eggman

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.564
are throwing our
plans into disarray.

00:02:57.564 --> 00:02:59.499
Find them and destroy them.

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:01.434
Acknowledged.

00:03:02.602 --> 00:03:05.305
So, one ship escaped.

00:03:05.305 --> 00:03:07.007
But not for long.

00:03:12.045 --> 00:03:13.113
[Screaming]

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:20.086
Aah!

00:03:20.086 --> 00:03:22.022
Cosmo, are you okay?

00:03:22.022 --> 00:03:23.323
Sorry, Cream.

00:03:23.323 --> 00:03:24.190
I was dreaming.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.892
Was it about Shadow?

00:03:25.892 --> 00:03:27.694
It was.

00:03:27.694 --> 00:03:30.130
Sonic and the others have
been thinking about him

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.932
ever since he reappeared.

00:03:31.932 --> 00:03:33.366
Why is Shadow the Hedgehog

00:03:33.366 --> 00:03:35.735
so important to you, anyway?

00:03:35.735 --> 00:03:37.404
Well...

00:03:37.404 --> 00:03:40.307
They met him when we
were on Chris' planet.

00:03:40.307 --> 00:03:42.676
You see, when Dr. Eggman found out

00:03:42.676 --> 00:03:45.946
that his grandfather had
created the Ultimate Creature,

00:03:45.946 --> 00:03:47.681
he broke into a government lab

00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:50.483
and woke Shadow from
suspended animation.

00:03:50.483 --> 00:03:52.252
Shadow worked with Dr. Eggman

00:03:52.252 --> 00:03:55.155
to threaten Chris' planet,
and he fought Sonic.

00:03:55.155 --> 00:03:57.590
But later, Shadow
joined up with Sonic

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.493
and sacrificed himself
to save everybody.

00:04:00.493 --> 00:04:02.796
We all thought he was lost forever.

00:04:02.796 --> 00:04:04.030
But we just saw him.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.632
So he must have survived.

00:04:05.632 --> 00:04:06.800
Yes.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.301
It's not possible.

00:04:08.301 --> 00:04:11.504
There's no way Shadow could've
made it through that battle.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.276
I thought I was imagining
it, at first,

00:04:16.276 --> 00:04:18.345
but we all saw Shadow.

00:04:18.345 --> 00:04:20.513
How did he survive?

00:04:25.418 --> 00:04:27.153
He didn't say anything.

00:04:27.153 --> 00:04:29.489
Why was he acting so mysterious?

00:04:29.489 --> 00:04:31.358
There was always something
weird about him.

00:04:35.662 --> 00:04:37.597
How do we know it wasn't a trick?

00:04:37.597 --> 00:04:40.200
Maybe Eggman's trying to fool us.

00:04:40.767 --> 00:04:43.103
Why are we wasting the day
asking ourselves questions

00:04:43.103 --> 00:04:44.838
that we can't possibly answer?

00:04:44.838 --> 00:04:46.006
Next time he turns up,

00:04:46.006 --> 00:04:48.008
we'll just ask him what's goin' on.

00:04:48.008 --> 00:04:49.576
ALL: Hmm.

00:04:50.443 --> 00:04:51.644
What'd I say?

00:04:59.619 --> 00:05:00.920
Is that Shadow?

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.491
I don't understand how those
strangers knew my name.

00:05:04.491 --> 00:05:07.794
They acted like they'd
met me somewhere before.

00:05:07.794 --> 00:05:09.829
But when? And where?

00:05:09.829 --> 00:05:11.297
When is easy.

00:05:11.297 --> 00:05:13.500
It was back when you were
in that other world.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.601
As for where,

00:05:14.601 --> 00:05:16.503
it was on Space Colony ARK.

00:05:16.503 --> 00:05:18.271
You sure have a terrible memory.

00:05:18.271 --> 00:05:21.274
It might be better for Shadow
if his past stays forgotten.

00:05:21.274 --> 00:05:22.042
Huh?

00:05:22.042 --> 00:05:23.676
What's that supposed to mean?

00:05:23.676 --> 00:05:24.778
N-nothing.

00:05:24.778 --> 00:05:26.046
You're hiding something.

00:05:26.046 --> 00:05:28.948
Are you suggesting that I
would try to deceive you?

00:05:28.948 --> 00:05:31.985
Why, I've never been so
insulted in my entire life!

00:05:31.985 --> 00:05:34.020
Hmm.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.489
Then, I won't tell you anything.

00:05:36.489 --> 00:05:39.392
Dr. Eggman needs to go
back to Bad Guy School

00:05:39.392 --> 00:05:41.327
to brush up on his
lying techniques.

00:05:41.327 --> 00:05:42.695
[Beeping]

00:05:42.695 --> 00:05:43.963
Huh?

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.075
Warp complete.

00:05:55.075 --> 00:05:57.410
Primary target identified.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.345
Launching attack now.

00:06:02.282 --> 00:06:04.417
[All yelling]

00:06:04.417 --> 00:06:05.752
Who's that attacking us?

00:06:05.752 --> 00:06:07.954
It's a ship I've never seen before!

00:06:07.954 --> 00:06:09.656
It came out of nowhere!

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.125
Guh! A Metarex!

00:06:13.726 --> 00:06:15.228
Shields up!

00:06:18.465 --> 00:06:20.400
Its laser cannons are too powerful!

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.669
Our shields will not
hold up for long.

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:23.803
Grr!

00:06:23.803 --> 00:06:25.939
Go get it, Shadow!

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:29.509
Destroy that ship, and I'll
tell you all about your past!

00:06:40.286 --> 00:06:42.589
They're launching a counterattack.

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:44.124
How pitiful.

00:06:44.858 --> 00:06:45.592
[Grunting]

00:06:47.393 --> 00:06:48.695
Not bad.

00:06:54.901 --> 00:06:56.636
But it is useless.

00:06:56.636 --> 00:06:58.104
Ya think so?

00:07:00.707 --> 00:07:03.076
You cannot harm me.

00:07:06.179 --> 00:07:07.180
Aah!

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.781
Well done, Shadow!

00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:10.717
What kind of attack is that?

00:07:10.717 --> 00:07:12.185
I have no clue.

00:07:12.185 --> 00:07:12.785
Oh!

00:07:12.785 --> 00:07:13.920
Allow me to demonstrate.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.188
[Clanging]

00:07:15.188 --> 00:07:16.689
As you can see,

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:18.992
a series of rapid strikes
on the ship's hull

00:07:18.992 --> 00:07:20.927
will create an intense vibration,

00:07:20.927 --> 00:07:23.663
which will shake the ship
apart from the inside.

00:07:31.704 --> 00:07:35.108
[Yelling]

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:38.144
Aaaaah!

[Metarex laughs evilly]

Ah!

00:07:45.151 --> 00:07:48.221
Shadow can't fight anymore,
because he used up all his power!

00:07:48.221 --> 00:07:49.756
He needs a jumpstart.

00:07:49.756 --> 00:07:52.158
I'm going to have
to bring him back.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.033
Your silly games are over.

00:08:00.867 --> 00:08:02.569
Now what're we gonna do?!

00:08:02.569 --> 00:08:03.870
Fire lasers now!

00:08:10.443 --> 00:08:11.377
Oh, no!

00:08:11.377 --> 00:08:13.079
Our lasers are destroyed!

00:08:13.079 --> 00:08:14.080
Aaaah!

Launch all missiles immediately!

Target that Metarex!

00:08:28.928 --> 00:08:30.863
Time to ship out!

The engines have overheated,
and are not working!

00:08:55.255 --> 00:08:58.157
Now I will exterminate
the hedgehog.

00:09:05.246 --> 00:09:07.715
What? A Metarex attacked Eggman?

00:09:07.715 --> 00:09:09.283
He didn't stand a chance.

00:09:09.283 --> 00:09:10.618
Take a look.

00:09:20.761 --> 00:09:21.762
[Gasp]

00:09:21.762 --> 00:09:23.297
What's wrong?

00:09:23.297 --> 00:09:24.498
I know that ship.

00:09:24.498 --> 00:09:26.767
That Metarex attacked
me and my clan.

00:09:31.172 --> 00:09:33.741
[Crying]

00:09:34.375 --> 00:09:36.844
Cosmo, we'll stop that Metarex!

00:09:36.844 --> 00:09:38.045
Fat chance.

00:09:38.045 --> 00:09:41.349
That thing was too powerful
for even Shadow to defeat.

00:09:41.349 --> 00:09:43.851
Whoa. It must be strong.

00:09:44.452 --> 00:09:46.387
I think we'd better retreat.

00:09:46.387 --> 00:09:47.521
Are you kidding?

00:09:47.521 --> 00:09:49.023
We can't let it win.

00:09:49.023 --> 00:09:51.192
I just want to pull
back temporarily.

00:09:51.192 --> 00:09:52.994
I don't think we should
take that thing on

00:09:52.994 --> 00:09:54.528
'til we have a chance
to analyze it,

00:09:54.528 --> 00:09:56.630
and come up with a
plan to blow it away.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.898
I agree.

00:09:57.898 --> 00:09:59.900
We have to think
this thing through.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.502
That'll be a first!

00:10:01.502 --> 00:10:03.738
I'm only trying to use my head.

00:10:04.238 --> 00:10:06.607
Then we might as well give up now.

00:10:06.607 --> 00:10:07.575
She's right.

00:10:09.143 --> 00:10:11.045
Aargh!

00:10:11.045 --> 00:10:12.213
Shadow...

00:10:12.213 --> 00:10:15.549
Don't worry about
him. He's a survivor.

00:10:15.549 --> 00:10:17.118
Am I right?

00:10:17.118 --> 00:10:18.386
Mm.

00:10:18.386 --> 00:10:21.589
Shadow made it through the
battle on Space Colony ARK.

00:10:21.589 --> 00:10:22.723
He must be okay.

00:10:22.723 --> 00:10:24.692
Let's get going while
we have the chance!

00:10:24.692 --> 00:10:26.861
I say we stay!

00:10:26.861 --> 00:10:28.062
We'd better decide now.

00:10:28.062 --> 00:10:29.997
There's something big
heading this way.

00:10:31.365 --> 00:10:33.868
It's coming out of warp space.

00:10:38.706 --> 00:10:41.442
I swore I'd destroy it. But...

00:10:41.442 --> 00:10:43.911
I can't risk their lives.

00:10:43.911 --> 00:10:46.213
Tails! Get us out of here, now!

00:10:46.213 --> 00:10:46.981
Huh?

00:10:46.981 --> 00:10:50.217
But Cosmo, you're the last one
here who should want to retreat.

00:10:50.217 --> 00:10:51.619
That Metarex is responsible

00:10:51.619 --> 00:10:53.788
for wiping out everybody
you cared about!

00:10:53.788 --> 00:10:55.689
Now's your chance to
make that ship pay

00:10:55.689 --> 00:10:57.658
for the pain and
misery it caused you!

00:10:57.658 --> 00:10:58.592
I can't.

00:10:58.592 --> 00:11:01.128
I want to fight that
thing alone, Amy.

00:11:01.128 --> 00:11:03.831
I'm willing to risk my
life to battle Metarex,

00:11:03.831 --> 00:11:05.499
but not yours.

00:11:06.767 --> 00:11:08.903
Sooner or later, we'll
have to face it.

00:11:10.037 --> 00:11:12.006
And there's no time
like the present!

00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:13.240
[Gasp]

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.475
All right, then!

00:11:14.475 --> 00:11:17.378
I still think it's a long
shot, but I'm willing to try!

00:11:17.378 --> 00:11:18.212
Let's do it!

00:11:18.212 --> 00:11:19.213
Mm!

00:11:19.213 --> 00:11:20.948
I'm glad you see it my way!

00:11:20.948 --> 00:11:22.183
We can win!

00:11:22.183 --> 00:11:23.350
Chao!

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:24.552
[Gasp]

00:11:25.186 --> 00:11:26.821
This means so much to me.

00:11:26.821 --> 00:11:28.489
Thank you all!

00:11:30.124 --> 00:11:31.325
[Chuckling]

00:11:37.465 --> 00:11:39.900
This battle is already over.

00:11:40.968 --> 00:11:42.503
Raise all shields!

00:11:42.503 --> 00:11:43.504
Right!

00:11:47.575 --> 00:11:50.077
They're only delaying
their destruction.

00:11:51.412 --> 00:11:53.347
There's no turning back now.

00:11:53.347 --> 00:11:54.081
Ready?

00:11:54.081 --> 00:11:55.249
Okay, let's go!

00:11:55.249 --> 00:11:57.118
Just give me the word!

00:11:57.118 --> 00:11:59.386
Are you ready to go, Chris?

00:11:59.386 --> 00:12:00.588
All set.

00:12:00.588 --> 00:12:01.889
Let's go for it!

00:12:03.557 --> 00:12:05.392
What are they up to?

00:12:08.696 --> 00:12:10.131
Expand the shield!

00:12:10.131 --> 00:12:11.599
Change to cloaking mode!

00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:17.671
So, they think they can hide.

00:12:19.073 --> 00:12:22.409
But these seeker missiles
will find their target.

00:12:33.087 --> 00:12:36.957
I'll unleash my entire
arsenal against them.

00:12:55.042 --> 00:12:57.578
That debris is meant to convince me

00:12:57.578 --> 00:12:59.280
I've destroyed their ship,

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.016
but I haven't... yet!

00:13:04.552 --> 00:13:06.487
ALL: Aah!

00:13:07.087 --> 00:13:09.490
I will destroy that ship.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:12.593
I'll keep firing missiles
until it's obliterated.

00:13:15.062 --> 00:13:15.829
Hmm.

00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:17.131
All clear.

00:13:18.566 --> 00:13:20.501
That Metarex saw through our trick,

00:13:20.501 --> 00:13:23.571
but it didn't realize
it was a double-trick.

00:13:23.571 --> 00:13:26.540
Let's go junk that Metarex!

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.475
Enough of these games!

00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:31.378
I'll fire all my missiles at once,

00:13:31.378 --> 00:13:34.281
and wipe them out
with one big bang.

00:13:34.281 --> 00:13:35.516
Huh?

00:13:35.516 --> 00:13:37.518
Why can't I fire?

00:13:37.518 --> 00:13:40.421
This Metarex is in a real jam now!

00:13:40.421 --> 00:13:42.389
I can blast right through it!

00:13:43.557 --> 00:13:44.925
Let's get outta here!

00:13:44.925 --> 00:13:45.759
Huh!

00:13:49.163 --> 00:13:53.234
[Explosions]

00:13:53.934 --> 00:13:55.369
It's a really bad idea

00:13:55.369 --> 00:13:58.072
to fire your weapons when your
missile tubes are clogged up.

00:13:58.072 --> 00:13:59.707
Now that you can't fight anymore,

00:13:59.707 --> 00:14:01.775
your only choice is to surrender!

00:14:01.775 --> 00:14:03.711
Never!

00:14:05.012 --> 00:14:05.813
Aah!

00:14:05.813 --> 00:14:08.082
It's gonna crash into
the Blue Typhoon!

00:14:10.985 --> 00:14:12.753
Tails better move it!

00:14:12.753 --> 00:14:14.288
Engines up!

00:14:18.792 --> 00:14:21.562
We don't have enough power
to get away in time.

00:14:21.562 --> 00:14:23.797
Routing all power to the engines.

00:14:31.238 --> 00:14:32.406
Oh, no!

00:14:32.406 --> 00:14:34.141
They won't get away fast enough!

00:14:34.141 --> 00:14:35.576
The one way to get enough power

00:14:35.576 --> 00:14:37.611
is to use the Master
Emerald at full force,

00:14:37.611 --> 00:14:39.113
but only I can do that.

00:14:39.113 --> 00:14:40.614
Look out!

00:14:42.116 --> 00:14:43.384
It's no use!

00:14:43.384 --> 00:14:45.085
We're gonna crash!

00:14:45.352 --> 00:14:46.887
It's all over!

00:14:46.887 --> 00:14:49.790
ALL: [Screaming]

00:14:53.061 --> 00:14:54.829

[Metarex roaring]

00:14:57.899 --> 00:14:58.866
Aah!

00:14:58.866 --> 00:14:59.701
[All gasping]

00:14:59.701 --> 00:15:01.402
It's Shadow!

00:15:03.705 --> 00:15:04.973
[Grunting]

00:15:06.074 --> 00:15:09.777
[Metarex roaring]

00:15:09.777 --> 00:15:12.680
You should never
underestimate that guy.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.583
But why wasn't Shadow
destroyed with Dr. Eggman?

00:15:16.117 --> 00:15:17.285
DR. EGGMAN: [Chuckling]

00:15:17.285 --> 00:15:21.155
I'm like a bad rash. You
can't get rid of me!

00:15:22.023 --> 00:15:24.025
Metarex missed me!

00:15:30.798 --> 00:15:32.734
As usual, I used my brains,

00:15:32.734 --> 00:15:34.369
and showed that missile the door!

00:15:34.369 --> 00:15:37.038
It's lucky for you, you don't have
to fit your head through there!

00:15:37.038 --> 00:15:38.673
Even more brilliant was the way

00:15:38.673 --> 00:15:41.643
Dr. Eggman faked an explosion
by using a smokescreen.

00:15:41.643 --> 00:15:43.011
While the smoke was hiding us,

00:15:43.011 --> 00:15:45.480
we warped to a safe
part of the galaxy.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.281
Hey, Sonic was just here.

00:15:47.281 --> 00:15:48.349
Where did he go?

00:15:48.349 --> 00:15:49.584
Huh?

00:15:52.286 --> 00:15:54.822
Something tells me we're
thinkin' the same thing.

00:15:54.822 --> 00:15:56.391
If we destroy the engine room,

00:15:56.391 --> 00:15:59.293
this Metarex will be out
of commission for good.

00:15:59.293 --> 00:16:02.163
I didn't ask for your
help, so stay out of this.

00:16:02.163 --> 00:16:04.666
I see you haven't lost
any of your charm.

00:16:07.168 --> 00:16:09.904
You certainly are
persistent, stranger.

00:16:09.904 --> 00:16:11.706
What do you mean, "stranger"?

00:16:11.706 --> 00:16:13.808
Don't you recognize me, Shadow?

00:16:18.713 --> 00:16:24.452
[Metarex growling]

00:16:24.452 --> 00:16:26.020
They did it!

00:16:26.954 --> 00:16:28.890
If you agree to surrender now,

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:31.225
we'll try to help you
put out those fires.

00:16:31.225 --> 00:16:32.794
I'll never surrender.

00:16:32.794 --> 00:16:34.796
Or give up my mission.

00:16:34.796 --> 00:16:35.797
Ah!

00:16:35.797 --> 00:16:36.864
Ah.

00:16:36.864 --> 00:16:39.434
What's your mission, anyway?

00:16:40.268 --> 00:16:43.304
To destroy Sonic and Dr. Eggman,

00:16:43.304 --> 00:16:45.673
no matter what it takes.

00:16:47.341 --> 00:16:48.843
What's it doing?

00:16:48.843 --> 00:16:52.580
That Metarex is trying to blow
us all away by self-destructing.

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.248
Let's go, Doctor!

00:16:54.248 --> 00:16:55.950
It's too late to get away!

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:56.918
Aah!

00:16:58.619 --> 00:16:59.687
What do we do?

00:16:59.687 --> 00:17:02.223
We need to buy some more time!

00:17:03.324 --> 00:17:08.196
[Yelling]

00:17:14.435 --> 00:17:15.536
What'd ya do?

00:17:15.536 --> 00:17:18.439
I stopped time from
advancing around the ship.

00:17:18.439 --> 00:17:20.308
We have 90 seconds.

00:17:20.308 --> 00:17:22.710
All right, now count down with me!

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:26.114
ALL: 88! 87! 86!

00:17:26.114 --> 00:17:28.750
If you want to disarm
it, you'd better hurry.

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:30.051
Right!

00:17:30.051 --> 00:17:31.419
Come in, Tails!

00:17:31.419 --> 00:17:33.621
We'll use the Sonic Power Cannon.

00:17:33.621 --> 00:17:36.057
Come to the ship
as fast as you can.

00:17:36.057 --> 00:17:38.426
That Metarex's armor is strong.

00:17:38.426 --> 00:17:39.894
Yeah, I know, Chris.

00:17:39.894 --> 00:17:42.563
But we can use a warp
field to make it weaker.

00:17:42.563 --> 00:17:43.831
Right.

00:17:44.298 --> 00:17:47.702
ALL: 64! 63! 62!

00:17:47.702 --> 00:17:50.071
Warp field driver
is all set, Tails.

00:17:50.071 --> 00:17:53.641
Prepare to send out a warp
field to surround the Metarex.

00:17:53.641 --> 00:17:54.609

00:18:04.285 --> 00:18:07.989

00:18:11.526 --> 00:18:14.462
Route all energy to
the Power Cannon!

00:18:16.798 --> 00:18:18.599
CHRIS: We have full power!

00:18:18.599 --> 00:18:19.834
TAILS: Load cannon!

00:18:19.834 --> 00:18:22.503
CHRIS: Sonic, get set for launch!

00:18:23.104 --> 00:18:24.372
Ready!

00:18:27.742 --> 00:18:30.278
Fire the cannon at my command!

00:18:30.278 --> 00:18:31.913
Targeting Metarex!

00:18:31.913 --> 00:18:35.183
Sonic Power Cannon, fire!

00:18:41.856 --> 00:18:47.695
EGGMAN'S CREW: 5! 4! 3! 2! 1!

00:18:47.695 --> 00:18:49.263
Zero!

00:18:49.797 --> 00:18:51.199
[Metarex shouting]

00:18:51.199 --> 00:19:00.174
Aaaaaaaaaah!

00:19:05.112 --> 00:19:07.815
That ship was one of my
most powerful Metarex.

00:19:07.815 --> 00:19:10.051
How did they defeat it?

00:19:10.051 --> 00:19:12.153
Thanks for saving us, Sonic!

00:19:12.153 --> 00:19:13.354
You'll regret it!

00:19:13.354 --> 00:19:16.123
[Evil chuckling]

00:19:28.169 --> 00:19:29.403
Ah!

00:19:31.239 --> 00:19:32.607
Ah!

00:19:36.911 --> 00:19:38.613
Ah!

00:19:40.581 --> 00:19:44.485
I finally got even with the
Metarex who wiped out my clan.

00:19:44.485 --> 00:19:46.487
I wish I could be at peace now,

00:19:46.487 --> 00:19:48.422
but there are more
Metarex out there,

00:19:48.422 --> 00:19:51.025
and more planets in danger.

00:19:51.025 --> 00:19:54.462
I have to keep fighting until
the galaxy is safe again.
