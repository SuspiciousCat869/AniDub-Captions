00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:10.978
This is great news,
Mr. President,

00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:13.013
and it couldn't have come
at a better time.

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:14.715
Now you're sure
to be re-elected.

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:16.917
- I don't know about that.
- Huh?

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:19.253
I'm not the real hero
of this story.

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:20.921
Look closer.

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:21.655
Huh?

00:00:28.262 --> 00:00:30.430
Sonic!

00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:31.832
Aah!

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:44.177
Aah!

00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:47.648
If we don't act fast, sir,
they'll elect Sonic president.

00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:50.684
I'll have to find myself
a real job.

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:51.919
[Growls]

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.187
We got to do something
right away!

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:56.723
Now, now.
Let's not overreact about this.

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:59.126
Just stay calm.

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:00.460
Think, think.

00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:02.829
There must be something
we can do.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.698
Ahh, that's it!
I know!

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:06.199
Hmm?

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.035
It's a brilliant idea!

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:09.803
We'll host a black-tie
charity ball

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:12.172
in celebration
of our recent victory!

00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:14.741
Yes, but what does
a victory celebration do

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:16.410
to solve our Sonic problem?

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:19.446
We're going to make Sonic
the guest of honor.

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:22.382
We'll invite the media,
get in a couple of photo ops,

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:23.984
that kind of thing.

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:27.588
It'll be in all the papers, all
over the cable-news talk shows.

00:01:27.688 --> 00:01:29.022
The president and Sonic.

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:30.657
The dynamic duo
battling together

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.526
against the forces
of oppression.

00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:34.695
Once the voters see that you
and Sonic are buddies,

00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:36.597
your approval rating
will go through the roof.

00:01:36.697 --> 00:01:37.931
There's no way you can lose.

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:40.133
Your re-election will be
a sure thing.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:41.501
I'll have the staff get started.

00:01:41.635 --> 00:01:43.303
We'll make sure all
the television reporters

00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:46.773
get personal invitations
to the free buffet tent.

00:01:50.177 --> 00:01:51.912
[Sighs]

00:01:52.012 --> 00:01:53.647
Go, go, go, go, go

00:01:53.747 --> 00:01:55.182
Gotta go fast

00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:57.384
Gotta go fast

00:01:57.484 --> 00:02:00.420
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:05.492
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:07.294
Got ourselves a situation

00:02:07.394 --> 00:02:09.596
Stuck in a new location

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:13.133
Without any explanation

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:15.235
No talk of relaxation

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:16.870
Don't, don't, don't

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.672
Don't blink, don't think

00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:20.474
Just go, go, go, go

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:21.975
Go, go

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:27.514
Sonic is on the run

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:29.416
Sonic, he's number one

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:33.153
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:34.655
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:02:34.755 --> 00:02:36.657
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:02:36.757 --> 00:02:39.226
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:41.128
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:02:41.228 --> 00:02:43.497
Sonic X

00:02:43.597 --> 00:02:46.333
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:48.368
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:50.270
Sonic X

00:02:58.385 --> 00:03:01.355
Hey, Sonic,
a letter came for you.

00:03:03.257 --> 00:03:05.058
Hmm?

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.861
Aah!
It's from the president!

00:03:08.295 --> 00:03:12.266
"You are cordially invited
to a black-tie charity ball."

00:03:12.366 --> 00:03:14.067
Sounds interesting.

00:03:14.168 --> 00:03:16.403
It's addressed to Sonic,
but it says right there

00:03:16.503 --> 00:03:18.405
he can bring as many friends
as he wants.

00:03:18.505 --> 00:03:19.940
Well, then, in that case,

00:03:20.073 --> 00:03:22.976
I say we dust off our best
party duds and make it a date.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.777
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

00:03:23.911 --> 00:03:27.848
I bet they'll serve lots
of yummy food there.

00:03:28.482 --> 00:03:31.418
I'm getting hungry
just thinking about it.

00:03:31.518 --> 00:03:33.453
Ahh.

00:03:34.521 --> 00:03:36.223
Me too.

00:03:36.323 --> 00:03:37.558
I'm back.

00:03:37.658 --> 00:03:39.793
Hey, Sonic.

00:03:39.893 --> 00:03:42.629
Guess what?
You won't believe it.

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:45.399
The president's giving a party,
and you're invited.

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:46.900
- I am?
- Mm-hmm.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.870
And all of us get to go, too.
It'll be fun.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.705
When is this party?

00:03:51.805 --> 00:03:53.240
On Thursday.

00:03:53.373 --> 00:03:54.875
Can't make it.

00:03:54.975 --> 00:03:56.176
Why can't you?

00:03:56.276 --> 00:03:58.378
I promised Helen we'd hang out.

00:03:58.512 --> 00:04:00.847
Helen? You mean the girl
in my class?

00:04:00.948 --> 00:04:03.150
Yeah, that's the one.
She's a friend of mine.

00:04:03.283 --> 00:04:04.518
I didn't know that.

00:04:04.618 --> 00:04:06.820
I met her over at the lake.

00:04:21.435 --> 00:04:23.070
Oh?

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.072
Hi, there.

00:04:25.706 --> 00:04:27.274
Thank you.

00:04:27.374 --> 00:04:28.976
You're Sonic, aren't you?

00:04:29.076 --> 00:04:30.310
You've heard of me?

00:04:30.444 --> 00:04:32.279
- Of course.
- That's pretty cool.

00:04:32.412 --> 00:04:34.815
- What's your name?
- Helen.

00:04:34.915 --> 00:04:37.484
Pleasure to meet ya.

00:04:38.085 --> 00:04:41.488
I come out here a lot.
I love to look at that island.

00:04:41.588 --> 00:04:43.724
- That one over there?
- Mm-hmm.

00:04:43.824 --> 00:04:47.494
My father says it's filled with
the most beautiful flowers.

00:04:47.594 --> 00:04:49.229
All different kinds.

00:04:49.329 --> 00:04:51.632
He always promises
he'll take me there.

00:04:51.732 --> 00:04:55.235
But he's always busy.

00:04:55.335 --> 00:04:56.436
Don't worry.

00:04:56.536 --> 00:04:58.739
I'm sure he'll take you there
one of these days.

00:04:58.839 --> 00:05:00.140
I don't know.

00:05:00.274 --> 00:05:03.577
My dad doesn't seem to ever
have enough time for me.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.446
I'd go myself, but...

00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:09.750
You really want to see
that island, Helen?

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.952
Of course I do.

00:05:12.085 --> 00:05:13.987
Then I'm gonna take ya.

00:05:14.087 --> 00:05:16.056
Ah!

00:05:22.062 --> 00:05:23.730
I promised.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.333
Oh, I got a lot of work to do.

00:05:26.433 --> 00:05:27.834
Hey, Chuck.

00:05:27.934 --> 00:05:29.970
I need some
life jackets and a boat.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.572
Check over in the storage room.

00:05:47.187 --> 00:05:50.023
Okay! Now, if everything
goes according to plan,

00:05:50.123 --> 00:05:51.858
Sonic should be
arriving any minute.

00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.661
Then we'll have him meet the
big guy and watch them go crazy.

00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:57.464
- He's here.
- Aah! It's time.

00:06:08.575 --> 00:06:10.444
WOMAN:
Say cheese.

00:06:13.847 --> 00:06:15.248
Here's our guest of honor.

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:16.450
Huh?

00:06:21.588 --> 00:06:23.557
Hey, where's Sonic?

00:06:23.657 --> 00:06:25.492
Not coming.

00:06:25.592 --> 00:06:27.627
What?!

00:06:27.728 --> 00:06:29.463
To the party!

00:06:29.563 --> 00:06:31.198
- Yay!
- Yay!

00:06:31.298 --> 00:06:33.934
Yeah, well, if Sonic's not
showing up to this clambake,

00:06:34.034 --> 00:06:35.569
I'm gettin' outta here.

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:38.638
The station better
pay for my parking.

00:06:38.739 --> 00:06:40.307
Aah!

00:06:40.407 --> 00:06:41.641
Please don't go yet.

00:06:41.775 --> 00:06:43.744
Sonic will be here any minute,
I promise.

00:06:43.844 --> 00:06:45.846
Why don't you hang out
at the buffet table awhile?

00:06:45.946 --> 00:06:48.148
Please?
Hey, don't stand there.

00:06:48.248 --> 00:06:50.951
Go and find Sonic
and bring him over here pronto.

00:06:51.084 --> 00:06:52.652
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:06:55.355 --> 00:06:58.458
[Mambo music plays]

00:06:58.558 --> 00:07:00.227
- [Door opens]
- Huh?

00:07:00.327 --> 00:07:02.396
This is official
government business.

00:07:02.496 --> 00:07:04.231
We need Sonic immediately.

00:07:04.331 --> 00:07:07.200
Who you think you are
barging into this house?

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.703
You Mr. Big Shot,
Too-Important-to-Knock, huh?

00:07:09.803 --> 00:07:12.072
Well, too bad.
Sonic's not here.

00:07:12.172 --> 00:07:13.974
You better not be
hiding him, ma'am.

00:07:14.074 --> 00:07:16.209
Don't tell me what not to do,
big shot.

00:07:16.343 --> 00:07:18.945
Now get out!
I got my cleaning.

00:07:19.045 --> 00:07:20.347
That's it!

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.949
All right, we're searching
the whole place.

00:07:23.083 --> 00:07:25.652
Tanaka!

00:07:28.255 --> 00:07:30.223
Don't get in our way, buddy.

00:07:30.323 --> 00:07:31.558
Stand back, Ella.

00:07:31.658 --> 00:07:34.327
This time it is my turn
to clean out the house.

00:07:34.428 --> 00:07:35.629
Haa!

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:37.531
Ugh!

00:07:38.265 --> 00:07:39.599
Ohh!

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:41.535
What do you mean, he's not home?

00:07:41.635 --> 00:07:44.037
Next time I take your advice,
don't let me.

00:07:44.137 --> 00:07:46.973
I'm gonna get Sonic here,
if it's the last thing I do.

00:07:47.073 --> 00:07:49.543
Connect me to defense.

00:07:49.643 --> 00:07:51.812
Mr. Secretary, sir,
we have an emergency.

00:07:51.945 --> 00:07:53.980
We need to fully mobilize
all troops.

00:07:54.114 --> 00:07:57.484
Get me Sonic!
He's ruining my party!

00:08:18.872 --> 00:08:20.440
Request has been entered, sir.

00:08:20.574 --> 00:08:23.944
All systems go.
Beginning search.

00:08:24.044 --> 00:08:25.445
This won't be easy.

00:08:25.545 --> 00:08:28.014
Our target moves
at 700 miles per hour.

00:08:28.114 --> 00:08:29.649
Stay alert.

00:08:34.421 --> 00:08:35.655
Target spotted.

00:08:35.755 --> 00:08:37.157
Yeah, where?

00:08:37.257 --> 00:08:38.959
S-13 district.

00:08:41.394 --> 00:08:42.696
Target is moving north

00:08:42.796 --> 00:08:44.831
at approximately
400 miles per hour.

00:08:44.931 --> 00:08:46.833
Just don't lose sight of him.

00:08:46.933 --> 00:08:48.635
We lost sight of him.

00:08:48.735 --> 00:08:52.038
Well, you better find him
in a hurry.

00:08:56.243 --> 00:08:58.411
Sure is noisy up there.

00:08:58.545 --> 00:09:02.315
You stay here.
I'll go get the boat, okay?

00:09:05.018 --> 00:09:07.754
Now, then.
Freshly squeezed juice anyone?

00:09:07.854 --> 00:09:11.124
Hey!
Running low on hors d'oeuvres.

00:09:11.224 --> 00:09:14.227
They better find
that hedgehog fast.

00:09:19.232 --> 00:09:21.468
I think I just spotted him.

00:09:25.071 --> 00:09:26.339
It is him.

00:09:26.439 --> 00:09:29.676
We've located Sonic
up at the Thorndyke residence.

00:09:33.346 --> 00:09:35.248
Down there.

00:09:36.082 --> 00:09:38.852
- Okay, you know what to do.
- All right.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.788
Hmm.

00:09:49.496 --> 00:09:50.830
Aah!

00:09:53.967 --> 00:09:55.302
We almost had him, sir.

00:09:55.402 --> 00:09:58.104
Now he's traveling north
on the freeway.

00:10:03.143 --> 00:10:06.012
This is getting on my nerves.

00:10:07.213 --> 00:10:10.850
Might as well grab some lunch.
We'll never catch him anyway.

00:10:12.218 --> 00:10:14.254
What do you mean,
he's off the freeway?

00:10:14.387 --> 00:10:16.856
What's that?
The lake?

00:10:18.959 --> 00:10:20.360
I'm back.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.096
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

00:10:25.966 --> 00:10:29.436
- When is he gonna be here?
- Is he coming or isn't he?

00:10:29.536 --> 00:10:33.139
Now, fellas, I assure you
Sonic is on the way.

00:10:33.239 --> 00:10:35.342
How about a little salami?

00:10:40.146 --> 00:10:42.082
Just a little bit farther.

00:10:42.182 --> 00:10:43.350
I'm so excited.

00:10:43.483 --> 00:10:46.152
I've dreamed of seeing
this island for so long, Sonic.

00:10:46.252 --> 00:10:49.456
I wish my father
could have come with me.

00:10:50.223 --> 00:10:54.361
If only he didn't
have to work so hard.

00:10:54.461 --> 00:10:57.263
We could be together more.

00:10:58.832 --> 00:11:01.935
Listen, Doug, you've been
working a lot of hours lately.

00:11:02.035 --> 00:11:05.105
I could hire someone part time
to make it easier.

00:11:05.205 --> 00:11:07.574
No need to, sir.
I don't mind the hard work.

00:11:07.674 --> 00:11:10.777
- Plus, I need the hours.
- All right, they're yours.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.446
You can count on me, sir.

00:11:18.218 --> 00:11:20.120
Almost there.

00:11:22.889 --> 00:11:24.524
Ah!

00:11:24.624 --> 00:11:25.291
Aah!

00:11:28.395 --> 00:11:29.863
Ehh!

00:11:29.963 --> 00:11:31.064
Who are they?

00:11:31.164 --> 00:11:32.298
Aah!

00:11:38.371 --> 00:11:40.140
Aah!

00:11:45.378 --> 00:11:46.880
- Aah!
- Aah!

00:11:47.013 --> 00:11:48.782
Ehh!

00:11:48.882 --> 00:11:51.751
All right.
Let's pull that baby ashore.

00:11:57.057 --> 00:11:58.525
Helen, are you okay?

00:11:58.625 --> 00:12:00.527
Mm-hmm.
I'm fine.

00:12:00.627 --> 00:12:02.262
Good.

00:12:06.633 --> 00:12:09.002
Hang on tight, okay?

00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:12.672
Whoa!

00:12:16.376 --> 00:12:17.944
Whoa!

00:12:21.214 --> 00:12:22.248
- Uh!
- Uh!

00:12:22.382 --> 00:12:23.750
- Aah!
- Whoa!

00:12:26.086 --> 00:12:27.987
Well, we almost made it.

00:12:28.088 --> 00:12:29.956
Whoa!

00:12:40.967 --> 00:12:43.970
Don't cry, Helen.
You're all right now.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:45.872
[Laughing]

00:12:45.972 --> 00:12:47.507
Hmm?

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.277
Sorry. It's just that...
Well, I feel so alive.

00:12:51.411 --> 00:12:54.114
I never thought somebody like me
could have such an adventure.

00:12:54.214 --> 00:12:56.116
Hmm.
Huh?

00:12:56.216 --> 00:12:59.119
These guys just don't give up,
do they?

00:12:59.219 --> 00:13:02.255
Helen, are you up
for another adventure?

00:13:02.355 --> 00:13:04.858
- Of course.
- All right!

00:13:06.559 --> 00:13:08.962
The target appears to have
left the forest, commander.

00:13:09.062 --> 00:13:11.331
Good. We'll be waiting
on the other side.

00:13:11.431 --> 00:13:14.200
Quick! Send a squadron
out there now!

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.970
[Sobbing]

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:20.540
This is boring.
Wonder what Sonic's doing.

00:13:35.688 --> 00:13:38.024
I really do love my mom and dad.

00:13:38.124 --> 00:13:41.227
They're so good to me.
That's why they work so hard.

00:13:41.327 --> 00:13:43.396
So that I can have
everything I need.

00:13:43.496 --> 00:13:46.599
They make sure I have the best
doctors, the best medicine.

00:13:46.699 --> 00:13:49.536
Even this wheelchair must have
cost them a lot of money.

00:13:49.669 --> 00:13:52.438
There's only one thing I want
more than anything, though.

00:13:52.572 --> 00:13:55.775
And that's to spend more time
with them and have more fun.

00:13:55.875 --> 00:13:58.378
But I had lots of fun today,
Sonic.

00:13:58.511 --> 00:14:02.282
I've never been so excited
in my whole life.

00:14:02.382 --> 00:14:05.518
I have a feeling we're both in
for a little more excitement.

00:14:05.618 --> 00:14:07.020
Huh?

00:14:10.657 --> 00:14:12.625
I'm ready if you are.

00:14:12.725 --> 00:14:14.327
- Okay.
- Go!

00:14:19.132 --> 00:14:20.500
Think we can beat them?

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.070
A piece of cake.
Now, hold on tight.

00:14:25.471 --> 00:14:27.273
Aah!

00:14:31.311 --> 00:14:32.779
Whoa!

00:14:35.582 --> 00:14:37.283
Thought you'd catch me, did ya?

00:14:37.383 --> 00:14:38.818
Sonic, up ahead!

00:14:38.918 --> 00:14:40.320
Whoa!

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:41.387
Aah!

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.402
Here they come!

00:15:03.243 --> 00:15:05.778
- Ready?
- Here goes.

00:15:07.814 --> 00:15:09.949
- Aah!
- Aah!

00:15:10.049 --> 00:15:11.551
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.322
What happened?

00:15:18.725 --> 00:15:21.294
[Both laugh]

00:15:21.394 --> 00:15:22.695
- Oh!
- Oh!

00:15:36.943 --> 00:15:38.845
Dad was right, Sonic.

00:15:38.945 --> 00:15:41.648
They're the prettiest flowers
anywhere.

00:15:48.121 --> 00:15:51.090
I'll pick some for ya, Helen.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:52.558
Don't!

00:15:52.659 --> 00:15:54.661
Leave them just as they are.

00:15:54.761 --> 00:15:57.697
I want to come back someday
with my mother and father.

00:15:57.797 --> 00:15:58.865
I get it.

00:15:58.965 --> 00:16:01.768
That way it'll be
just as beautiful.

00:16:06.673 --> 00:16:07.941
Huh?

00:16:11.611 --> 00:16:13.413
These guys just don't quit!

00:16:13.513 --> 00:16:14.847
We can't let them up here.

00:16:14.948 --> 00:16:17.250
If we do, they'll ruin
all the flowers.

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:19.719
Not if I can help it.

00:16:19.819 --> 00:16:21.487
Hey!

00:16:22.288 --> 00:16:24.090
Over here!

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.326
There he is.

00:16:30.063 --> 00:16:32.131
Those guys are faster
than I thought.

00:16:32.231 --> 00:16:32.932
Aah!

00:16:40.039 --> 00:16:41.641
Bummer.

00:16:41.774 --> 00:16:42.875
Huh?

00:16:50.183 --> 00:16:52.085
- Aah!
- Aah!

00:16:58.622 --> 00:17:00.424
MAN: All right, Sonic.
Let's go.

00:17:00.524 --> 00:17:03.093
You're wanted by the president.
And don't pull any funny stuff.

00:17:03.193 --> 00:17:05.028
I'll go, but you gotta catch me.

00:17:05.128 --> 00:17:07.731
All right, you asked for it.

00:17:09.333 --> 00:17:10.834
Fire!

00:17:20.377 --> 00:17:22.379
- Hey!
- SONIC: Call me.

00:17:22.512 --> 00:17:23.647
Whoa!

00:17:28.251 --> 00:17:29.886
Can you fly this thing?

00:17:29.986 --> 00:17:33.357
I usually leave the flying
to Tails, but I'll sure try.

00:17:34.157 --> 00:17:36.059
- Uhh!
- Uhh!

00:17:36.159 --> 00:17:38.762
Hey, I almost forgot something.

00:17:50.474 --> 00:17:53.643
Ah!
Sonic, the flowers!

00:17:56.146 --> 00:17:57.347
Ahh!

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:09.559
Well, I guess our
adventure's over, Sonic.

00:18:09.659 --> 00:18:11.828
Guess so.
Did you have fun?

00:18:11.928 --> 00:18:13.663
Sure did.

00:18:13.797 --> 00:18:15.399
It's getting late.
I should take you home.

00:18:15.499 --> 00:18:18.635
But, Sonic, aren't you supposed
to go see the president?

00:18:18.769 --> 00:18:20.170
That guy can wait.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:23.273
But I'd feel awful if you didn't
get to see him because of me.

00:18:23.407 --> 00:18:26.676
Please go see him.
I'll even go with you.

00:18:26.777 --> 00:18:28.979
Since you put it that way.

00:18:31.114 --> 00:18:33.083
What's that?
He did?

00:18:33.183 --> 00:18:35.252
The what?
The chopper?

00:18:35.352 --> 00:18:37.020
What now?
Aah!

00:18:39.289 --> 00:18:40.323
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:18:40.424 --> 00:18:42.926
It's Sonic.
He came after all.

00:18:43.026 --> 00:18:45.195
He's here!
He's really here!

00:18:48.031 --> 00:18:50.500
Great to finally meet you,
Sonic.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.702
Hmm.

00:18:52.803 --> 00:18:55.005
Now, hold that right there.

00:18:55.138 --> 00:18:58.008
Hurry, hurry.
Reporters, photographers.

00:18:58.108 --> 00:19:00.677
This is the moment
you've been waiting for.

00:19:00.811 --> 00:19:02.779
[Snoring]

00:19:04.815 --> 00:19:06.750
Aah!

00:19:09.052 --> 00:19:11.588
[Laughter]

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.094
HELEN:
So there we were,

00:19:18.195 --> 00:19:20.497
in the middle of all these
beautiful flowers.

00:19:20.597 --> 00:19:21.264
All of a sudden,

00:19:21.398 --> 00:19:23.633
we looked down and saw
the men climbing toward us.

00:19:23.767 --> 00:19:25.268
Before I knew
what was happening,

00:19:25.402 --> 00:19:27.370
Sonic and I were roaring
into the forest

00:19:27.471 --> 00:19:30.440
and the men were following us on
these strange flying bicycles.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:31.975
But we were way ahead of them.

00:19:32.075 --> 00:19:35.579
And then we came to a cliff,
looking way down over the ocean.

00:19:35.712 --> 00:19:37.147
Then this helicopter came

00:19:37.247 --> 00:19:39.015
so they could take Sonic
to the president.

00:19:39.115 --> 00:19:41.151
And they shot off this rope
with a claw on the end.

00:19:41.251 --> 00:19:43.153
But Sonic grabbed me, and...

00:19:43.253 --> 00:19:44.855
Mama, could I...

00:19:44.955 --> 00:19:48.058
I don't think I've ever
seen you eat like this.

00:19:48.158 --> 00:19:49.893
Now, hold on, honey.

00:19:49.993 --> 00:19:51.261
I'm gonna get a refill, too.

00:19:51.361 --> 00:19:55.131
With a story as fascinating as
this, I'm gonna need my energy.

00:19:55.232 --> 00:19:56.466
Hurry back, Dad.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.635
And I'll tell you
about the helicopter.

00:19:58.768 --> 00:20:00.804
Sonic grabbed me
out of my wheelchair,

00:20:00.937 --> 00:20:03.206
and he carried me
all the way up the rope.

00:20:03.306 --> 00:20:04.508
All right, all right.

00:20:04.608 --> 00:20:07.577
Our little girl's
had quite the adventure.

00:20:07.711 --> 00:20:10.247
Do you hear?
She's so changed.

00:20:10.347 --> 00:20:12.582
She sounds so happy.

00:20:12.682 --> 00:20:15.352
I just want to be there for her.

00:20:15.452 --> 00:20:17.420
Spend more time with her.

00:20:17.521 --> 00:20:18.588
[Crying]

00:20:18.688 --> 00:20:21.625
Yeah, I've been working
too many hours lately.

00:20:21.725 --> 00:20:24.127
I haven't spent enough time
with the family.

00:20:24.227 --> 00:20:26.830
Let's plan a day-trip
to that island Helen loves.

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:28.899
What do you say?

00:20:28.999 --> 00:20:31.601
Mom, Dad.
What's taking you so long?

00:20:31.701 --> 00:20:33.103
We're coming, honey.

00:20:33.203 --> 00:20:34.671
Sorry, dear.

00:20:34.771 --> 00:20:38.174
Your father and I were having
an important discussion.

00:20:38.275 --> 00:20:40.610
I'm coming to the most
exciting part.

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:42.946
So, anyway, we got
into the helicopter.

00:20:43.046 --> 00:20:45.181
A helicopter.
I've never been in one.

00:20:45.282 --> 00:20:47.684
