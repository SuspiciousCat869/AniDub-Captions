You were fantastic
in that last take, Lindsey,

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:32.833
but I'd like to give it
one more go.

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:36.303
Take it slower and let
those tears go this time.

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:39.306
And, Roger, please try
to show some feeling this take.

Ella?

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:48.382
What happened to your hair?

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:50.551
Did Mom get you a part
in the movie?

00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:51.618
That's right.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:52.853
They needed someone to play

00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:54.855
an extremely young
and beautiful housekeeper,

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:56.557
so they typecast me.

How do I look?

00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.693

Places, please!

00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:05.032
But, Brett,
what will I do without you?

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:07.401
You can't leave me now.

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:09.102
I need you, Brett!

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:10.971
Brett, don't go!

Print it.

00:01:17.344 --> 00:01:20.280
She sounds like she's
really into that guy Brett.

[Laughs]

00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:23.383
Was I good?

00:01:23.517 --> 00:01:24.918
Great.

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:27.554
Oh, I thought you were
bringing your friends.

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:28.589
Where are they?

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.424
We're right here!

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:32.926
My!
You look like a real fox!

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:34.761
It's amazing what
the makeup department

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:37.764
can do with a little hair
and a pot of glue these days.

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:41.168
Didn't you tell her
about us yet?

00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:44.071
I tried, but Mom's
clueless sometimes.

00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:45.973
Hey, I haven't seen
Cream and Cheese.

00:01:46.073 --> 00:01:48.375
- Wonder where they went.
- Don't ask me.

Hold it.
There.

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:53.914
You see?

00:01:56.016 --> 00:01:58.418
I didn't call for animals
in this shot.

00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:02.356
Don't worry, D. B., we can
erase it digitally in post.

00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:04.324
Good idea.
Let's print it.

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:08.495
All right, let's move on
to the next scene, people.

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:09.997
Aah.

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:15.335
Hmm.
Hmm.

00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:20.874
We'll be
out of camera range over here.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:23.777
Okay.
Rehearse it.

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:25.078
Please, Brett!

00:02:25.212 --> 00:02:26.680
Don't leave me!
Come back!

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:29.449
What will I do?
Where shall I go?

MAN: Oh!

00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:33.186
Huh?

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:35.455
I didn't notice
this thing before.

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:39.226
What is it?
Some kind of crazy sculpture?

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.196
Guess I'll have to move
it out of the way.

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:49.670
On second thought,
I'll move the camera.

00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:55.776
Oh. Oh.

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.012
I don't think this
is part of the movie.

He's probably
exploring around as usual.

I sure hope Sonic
doesn't get into any trouble.

I thought I heard something.

Perhaps it was just the wind.

something to do with all this!

00:10:26.526 --> 00:10:28.294
Disappears under the sun."

00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:31.464
Wonder what that means.

00:10:36.369 --> 00:10:37.403
What, Chris?

00:10:37.537 --> 00:10:39.672
I feel a breeze
coming from the base.

00:10:39.772 --> 00:10:42.775
There must be a hidden
passageway underneath it.

00:10:42.909 --> 00:10:44.878
Aah!

00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:49.616
Whoa!

00:10:49.716 --> 00:10:50.483
Ahh.

00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:52.485
Do you think we should go
take a look?

00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:55.321
We may be able to rescue Sonic.

00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:57.357
Let's go!

00:10:57.457 --> 00:10:59.259
Hold on.

00:10:59.359 --> 00:11:01.861
It could be dangerous
down there.

00:11:01.961 --> 00:11:03.563
I know that.

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:07.100
But don't you think we should
let the police check it out?

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.067
I mean...

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:09.669
Hmm.

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:12.071
But, Amy, we...

00:11:12.205 --> 00:11:13.873
All right.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.547
I thought you were scared,
Chris.

00:11:20.647 --> 00:11:22.382
Of course I'm scared.

00:11:22.482 --> 00:11:24.017
Aren't you?

00:11:24.117 --> 00:11:25.185
No.

00:11:27.654 --> 00:11:29.722
Aah!

00:11:38.097 --> 00:11:40.166
[Both laugh]

00:11:41.267 --> 00:11:44.170
Remember, Chris, ghosts love it
if they see you're scared.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.573
So if we run into one,
stay calm.

00:11:46.673 --> 00:11:48.875
I'll pretend like
I don't even notice them.

00:11:48.975 --> 00:11:50.476
[Ghosts giggling]

00:11:53.112 --> 00:11:54.881
- Aah!
- Aah!

00:12:02.589 --> 00:12:04.757
It seems like they're scared
of that thing.

00:12:04.857 --> 00:12:06.392
All right.

00:12:06.492 --> 00:12:10.430
Let's show those ghosts
that we can spook them!

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:11.798
Amy, wait!

00:12:19.772 --> 00:12:21.241
Where'd the ghosts go?

00:12:21.341 --> 00:12:24.210
They must be
around here someplace.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.046
They can go through walls.
Maybe they already escaped.

00:12:27.146 --> 00:12:29.549
They're heading
down those stairs!

00:12:29.649 --> 00:12:30.550
[Giggling]

00:12:33.653 --> 00:12:35.054
[Moaning]

00:12:37.624 --> 00:12:39.058
Huh?

00:12:39.158 --> 00:12:41.027
[Laughing]

00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:53.640
Are you ready, Amy?

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.475
Let's do it!

00:13:02.148 --> 00:13:04.484
Is anybody here?

00:13:09.522 --> 00:13:12.592
It looks like the ghosts
led us to a dead end.

00:13:12.692 --> 00:13:14.160
Sonic must be here!

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.928
But there's nobody around.

00:13:16.029 --> 00:13:18.431
Where could they be keeping him?

00:13:18.531 --> 00:13:21.034
Sonic?

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:23.469
Sonic?

00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:25.138
SONIC:
Amy! Chris!

00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:26.539
I'm up here!

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.041
- Sonic!
- Sonic!

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:30.043
There's not much time,
so listen!

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:32.612
[Distorted voice]
I've always loved you, Amy.

00:13:32.712 --> 00:13:33.813
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:13:33.913 --> 00:13:35.748
Well, I'm sure you know
how I feel.

00:13:35.848 --> 00:13:38.251
You can free me
if you put that stone

00:13:38.351 --> 00:13:39.752
into the space on the wall.

00:13:39.852 --> 00:13:41.087
Right, Sonic.

00:13:41.187 --> 00:13:44.390
I sure am glad we brought
this thing along.

00:13:45.892 --> 00:13:48.494
That must be where it goes!

00:13:52.598 --> 00:13:55.101
[Normal voice] I said don't
put that thing over there, Amy!

00:13:55.234 --> 00:13:57.236
That's how the ghosts get power!

00:13:57.804 --> 00:13:59.005
Is this where it goes?

00:13:59.138 --> 00:14:00.540
[Distorted voice]
Wonderful, Amy!

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.975
Now place that stone
in the space on the wall

00:14:03.076 --> 00:14:05.478
with the moon side
facing upwards.

00:14:05.578 --> 00:14:07.647
What do you mean,
"The moon side"?

00:14:07.747 --> 00:14:10.049
Oh, I see!

00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:12.185
I don't think
this is a good idea.

00:14:12.285 --> 00:14:13.519
It'll be fine.

00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:15.288
Sonic knows exactly
what he's doing.

00:14:15.388 --> 00:14:16.789
[Normal voice]
No, Amy, don't!

00:14:16.889 --> 00:14:19.258
[Distorted voice]
You're the best, Amy.

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:20.927
Oh, it was nothing.

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:24.530
I'm just glad we're going
to be back together again.

00:14:37.844 --> 00:14:39.946
[Laughs]

00:14:49.355 --> 00:14:50.656
Where did he come from?

00:14:50.757 --> 00:14:53.593
Thank you, Amy!

00:14:53.693 --> 00:14:56.662
[Laughs evilly]

00:14:56.763 --> 00:15:00.199
Hey! That was you
pretending to be Sonic!

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:02.335
You don't have a chance
against that thing!

00:15:02.468 --> 00:15:04.170
Don't even think
about taking it on!

00:15:04.303 --> 00:15:05.304
Ha!

00:15:06.806 --> 00:15:10.209
I'm not letting some ghoul
make a fool out of me!

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.381
Ha!

00:15:15.481 --> 00:15:16.783
Oh!

00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:19.685
Whoa!

00:15:19.786 --> 00:15:21.687
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

00:15:21.788 --> 00:15:23.222
No!

00:15:23.322 --> 00:15:26.125
Let me go!

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:28.194
Oh.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.668
Amy!

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:38.871
Please, Amy,
open your eyes for me.

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:41.274
Aah!

00:15:41.407 --> 00:15:42.675
[Distorted voice]
Ha ha ha ha ha!

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:45.011
Stop interfering with my plans

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:46.679
or you'll never leave
this castle!

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:47.947
Amy!

00:15:48.047 --> 00:15:48.681
Ugh.

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:50.950
[All laughing]

00:15:55.254 --> 00:15:56.422
Aah!

00:15:56.522 --> 00:15:58.424
Heh heh heh.

00:15:59.025 --> 00:16:00.927
Amy, please don't do it!

00:16:01.027 --> 00:16:03.029
Aah!

00:16:05.865 --> 00:16:08.734
[All laughing]

00:16:08.835 --> 00:16:11.237
Sonic!
Help me!

00:16:11.337 --> 00:16:13.739
[Cackles]

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.477
I'll help you, but first
you have to get me out of here!

00:16:18.945 --> 00:16:20.012
Please.

00:16:20.112 --> 00:16:22.048
Stop, Amy!

00:16:32.358 --> 00:16:33.926
Now I get it!

00:16:34.026 --> 00:16:35.495
SONIC: [Distorted voice]
Wonderful, Amy!

00:16:35.595 --> 00:16:37.930
Now place that stone
in the space on the wall

00:16:38.064 --> 00:16:39.966
with the moon side
facing upwards.

00:16:40.066 --> 00:16:42.502
The moon side upwards.

00:16:42.635 --> 00:16:44.937
What did it say
on that pedestal?

00:16:45.037 --> 00:16:47.139
"Appears under the moon.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.942
Disappears under the sun. "

00:16:50.042 --> 00:16:52.311
Hey, that's it!

00:16:52.778 --> 00:16:55.181
The ghosts show up
when the moon's facing up.

00:16:55.281 --> 00:16:57.183
[All groan]

00:16:57.283 --> 00:17:01.420
And when the sun is up,
they're in big trouble!

00:17:03.256 --> 00:17:04.891
Aah!

00:17:04.991 --> 00:17:06.125
Aah!

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:15.368
Amy, are you okay?

00:17:15.501 --> 00:17:16.435
Huh?

00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:18.004
Oh, Sonic?

00:17:18.137 --> 00:17:19.272
Oh, Sonic!

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:22.208
Please, Amy, we still have to
stop the ghost attack!

00:17:22.308 --> 00:17:23.709
[All laughing]

00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:26.445
I'll show you!

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:31.617
Bring it on!

00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:33.619
[Growls]

00:17:34.954 --> 00:17:37.823
You spooks better split
right away!

00:17:37.924 --> 00:17:39.392
- Aah!
- Aah!

00:17:42.595 --> 00:17:43.796
Hey!

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:53.539
You creeps can't
creep me out anymore!

00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:59.779
It's time to say goodbye!

00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:01.747
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:18:01.847 --> 00:18:02.815
[Crash]

00:18:06.118 --> 00:18:07.053
Hmm!

00:18:07.653 --> 00:18:10.423
CHRIS:
Mom! Wake up!

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:14.093
Chris?

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:17.296
How was I in that take?

00:18:17.396 --> 00:18:19.198
This isn't a movie, Mom.

00:18:19.298 --> 00:18:20.499
SONIC:
Chris!

00:18:20.633 --> 00:18:22.501
Get going now!

00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:24.003
Here, Sonic!

00:18:24.604 --> 00:18:26.505
Thanks!

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:27.840
[Growls]

00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:31.444
Go on.

00:18:31.544 --> 00:18:33.879
I'll catch up
with you guys later!

00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:49.629
[Moans]

00:18:51.897 --> 00:18:53.366
Ugh!

00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:58.771
See ya!

00:18:58.871 --> 00:19:01.273
Let's go, Mom!
We gotta hurry!

00:19:01.374 --> 00:19:03.342
If we're going to film
an action scene,

00:19:03.442 --> 00:19:05.277
can't I have
more comfortable shoes?

00:19:05.378 --> 00:19:06.646
Huh.

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:11.584
I thought you guys would be
out of this place by now.

00:19:11.684 --> 00:19:13.452
Did you stop the ghosts?

00:19:13.552 --> 00:19:16.188
They didn't stand
a ghost of a chance.

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:18.691
[Growls]

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:22.928
What?

00:19:23.796 --> 00:19:25.831
[Growls]

00:19:25.965 --> 00:19:28.467
Okay, maybe I was wrong!

00:19:28.601 --> 00:19:29.335
[Panting]

00:19:29.435 --> 00:19:31.170
[Growls]

00:19:32.872 --> 00:19:34.874
Hurry, Chris!

00:19:35.374 --> 00:19:37.143
Aah!

00:19:38.978 --> 00:19:40.980
Aah!

00:19:44.216 --> 00:19:46.118
- Aah!
- Aah!

00:19:49.722 --> 00:19:53.893
Amy,
did I put the right side up?

00:19:54.794 --> 00:19:56.195
It's the moon side.

00:19:56.295 --> 00:19:58.798
So I messed up?

00:19:58.898 --> 00:20:00.366
Yeah, big time.

00:20:00.466 --> 00:20:01.500
LINDSEY:
That was fun.

00:20:01.634 --> 00:20:03.502
But I didn't know
this was a fantasy film!

00:20:03.602 --> 00:20:07.006
Those special effects
were incredibly realistic.

00:20:07.106 --> 00:20:08.974
[All shouting]

00:20:09.075 --> 00:20:10.543
[Sighs]

00:20:10.643 --> 00:20:13.045
You really had us worried.

00:20:13.145 --> 00:20:14.947
Did something go wrong?

00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:18.451
Nobody ever got away from
the ghosts down there before.

00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:19.985
Who are they?

00:20:20.086 --> 00:20:21.821
Where did they all come from?

00:20:21.921 --> 00:20:24.156
Well, some folks say

00:20:24.256 --> 00:20:27.660
this place sits
on an ancient burial ground.

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:32.531
When the man
who built the castle

00:20:32.665 --> 00:20:34.266
heard legends about ghosts,

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.802
he laughed and said
they were nonsense.

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:40.339
Then the man disappeared
the first night he stayed here,
