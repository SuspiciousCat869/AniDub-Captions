00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.168
Last time on Sonic X,

00:00:01.168 --> 00:00:03.337
a fleet of Metarex
led by Dr. Eggman

00:00:03.337 --> 00:00:05.172
sent Sonic and friends
into ship shock.

00:00:05.172 --> 00:00:06.673
Our heroes battled bravely,

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:09.176
but were quickly outnumbered
by their fearsome foes.

00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:10.611
Sonic rushed to counter-attack,

00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:12.980
when Eggman activated
the ultimate speed trap,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.215
an energy barrier that
Sonic couldn't crack.

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:18.085
With the end at hand, Tails
came up with a perilous plan.

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:20.087
And thanks to the power
of the Master Emerald,

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:22.389
our heroes foiled the
enemy fleet and escaped.

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:24.391
But with the rest of
the Metarex closing in,

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.593
can Sonic and friends
survive another siege?

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:28.362
Or have they only
delayed their doom?

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:30.264

Stuck in a new location

Without any explanation

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.387
No talk of relaxation

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.022
Don't, don't, don't

Sonic X

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:43.444
We have Sonic on the run.

00:01:44.112 --> 00:01:46.614
He is hiding somewhere
in this area.

00:01:46.614 --> 00:01:48.549
He picked an excellent refuge.

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.953
There are intense electromagnetic
waves in that region of space.

00:01:51.953 --> 00:01:53.788
The scanners will be useless.

00:01:53.788 --> 00:01:57.625
He and his crew mates will have the
opportunity to recover from our battle.

00:01:57.625 --> 00:01:59.160
We will find them.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.796
And when we do, they will
be completely destroyed...

00:02:01.796 --> 00:02:03.398
with your help, Dr. Eggman.

00:02:03.398 --> 00:02:04.499
Huh!

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:06.334
Once Sonic has been eliminated,

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:08.970
the victory of the
Metarex will be assured.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.874
Any resistance against
us will be futile.

00:02:12.874 --> 00:02:15.677
We'll stomp on those rebels
like they're a bunch of ants.

00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:18.046
And then we'll fulfill the
destiny of the galaxy.

00:02:18.046 --> 00:02:19.147

Don't you like the plan?

00:02:35.163 --> 00:02:36.397
Speak up.

00:02:36.397 --> 00:02:39.834
You do have an
objection, don't you?

00:02:39.834 --> 00:02:40.968
All right.

00:02:40.968 --> 00:02:42.804
If you insist on knowing.

00:02:42.804 --> 00:02:46.240
One thing still bothers
me about you Metarex...

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.079
I can't figure out what you're trying
to accomplish with all this destruction.

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.981
I can understand trying
to conquer planets,

00:02:53.981 --> 00:02:56.884
but if you keep up this
rampage across the galaxy,

00:02:56.884 --> 00:02:59.354
there won't be anybody
left to rule over.

00:02:59.354 --> 00:03:00.955
It doesn't make sense.

00:03:00.955 --> 00:03:03.491
For someone of your
reputation, Doctor,

00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:05.593
you have a surprising
lack of vision.

00:03:05.593 --> 00:03:07.862
I'm beginning to suspect
that you Metarex

00:03:07.862 --> 00:03:10.565
have completely lost your minds.

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:12.066
Perhaps, Doctor.

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:14.969
But the question is, what are
you going to do about it?

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:17.872
The time has come for
you to choose sides.

00:03:17.872 --> 00:03:20.942
Will you join our quest
to transform the galaxy,

00:03:20.942 --> 00:03:23.644
or will you fight
against us with Sonic?

Bein' a croc, I'm naturally

But you're probably
wondering why I'm

00:04:06.988 --> 00:04:09.657
playing piano instead
of doing detective work.

00:04:09.657 --> 00:04:11.592
It all started after
the boys and me

00:04:11.592 --> 00:04:14.762
said "adios" to the crew
of the Blue Typhoon.

00:08:33.187 --> 00:08:34.588
We need parts.

00:08:34.588 --> 00:08:37.224
Tails and Cosmo are waiting
at the ship for them.

00:08:41.295 --> 00:08:43.931
I wonder where Sonic
and the others are?

00:08:43.931 --> 00:08:45.833
What if the Metarex found them?

00:08:45.833 --> 00:08:48.736
I'll just dash to the store
and buy the parts we need.

00:08:48.736 --> 00:08:51.639
But when you pay at the register,
they'll see your face.

00:08:51.639 --> 00:08:52.306
Huh?

00:08:52.306 --> 00:08:53.307
Huh! Huh! Huh!

00:08:53.307 --> 00:08:55.509
Hey, this isn't the
express lane, buddy!

00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:57.244
Okay, you're right.

00:08:57.244 --> 00:08:59.180
I can't do any shopping.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.681
What are we gonna do?

00:09:00.681 --> 00:09:03.184
Without those parts,
we'll be stuck here.

00:09:03.184 --> 00:09:03.718
Hmm.

00:09:03.718 --> 00:09:05.886
ALL: Hmm.

00:09:06.654 --> 00:09:08.889
Why don't you let me
buy the parts for ya?

00:09:08.889 --> 00:09:09.857
[Gasp]

00:09:09.857 --> 00:09:11.125
Would you really?

00:09:11.125 --> 00:09:15.162
Sure. I run errands all the time
when I'm doing undercover work.

00:09:15.162 --> 00:09:18.165
As you can see, I don't
just collar crooks.

00:09:18.165 --> 00:09:19.400
Uh...

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.503
Sorry, but we've only got
enough cash for the parts.

00:09:22.503 --> 00:09:24.505
Aw, don't worry about my salary.

00:09:24.505 --> 00:09:28.075
I think you guys are A-OK,
so I'll take an IOU.

00:09:28.075 --> 00:09:29.443
Then it's settled!

00:09:29.443 --> 00:09:31.045
All right, then.

00:09:31.045 --> 00:09:32.546
Here's your shopping list.

00:09:38.252 --> 00:09:40.087
Hm. Mm-hmm.

00:09:43.023 --> 00:09:44.492
Hmm?

00:09:44.492 --> 00:09:47.161
This is one of the parts
I need for my ship!

00:09:50.097 --> 00:09:51.766
I'm shoppin' for Sonic!

00:09:51.766 --> 00:09:53.801
I ain't no crooked croc.

00:09:53.801 --> 00:09:55.703
Hm.

00:09:56.103 --> 00:09:58.038
Huh.

00:09:58.606 --> 00:10:01.809
One power module, one
gravity stabilizer,

00:10:01.809 --> 00:10:05.079
two quantum flux capacitors,
one hyper-hammer,

00:10:05.079 --> 00:10:08.115
three laser fusion units,
one air freshener...

00:10:08.115 --> 00:10:09.550
Come in, Commander.

00:10:14.555 --> 00:10:17.057
So, my instincts were correct.

00:10:17.057 --> 00:10:19.260
Sonic is hiding on that planet.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.062
And when he fixes his ship
and returns to space,

00:10:22.062 --> 00:10:23.964
I'll be waiting for him!

00:10:31.981 --> 00:10:34.383
We put up "Wanted"
posters all around town.

It was exhausting.

00:10:36.819 --> 00:10:38.954
Is there something wrong, Doctor?

00:10:38.954 --> 00:10:39.922
Hm?

00:10:41.557 --> 00:10:42.892
It's none of your business.

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:44.260
Let's go!

Roger!

00:10:44.927 --> 00:10:46.095
Whatever.

00:10:47.029 --> 00:10:48.197
Hm?

00:10:48.831 --> 00:10:50.132
Huh?

00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:58.240
Hm.

00:11:02.878 --> 00:11:04.313
[Sigh]

00:11:04.313 --> 00:11:05.781
For a second there,
I thought he saw me.

[Door opening]

00:11:07.316 --> 00:11:08.884
How'd it go, Vector?

00:11:08.884 --> 00:11:09.885
No problem.

00:11:13.022 --> 00:11:15.658
All right, let's go help
Vector unload the parts.

00:11:15.658 --> 00:11:16.625
Hm.

00:11:20.162 --> 00:11:22.531
Maybe they did run into trouble.

00:11:22.531 --> 00:11:24.099
It must be the Metarex.

00:11:24.099 --> 00:11:26.302
These parts are heavy!
[Everyone groaning]

00:11:26.302 --> 00:11:27.002
Chao!

00:11:27.002 --> 00:11:27.736
Look out!

00:11:27.736 --> 00:11:28.737
[Crash] Whoa!

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.409
This is the last part.

00:11:33.409 --> 00:11:36.245
Let's call Tails to pick
this up in the X Tornado.

00:11:36.245 --> 00:11:37.213
Chao!

00:11:37.213 --> 00:11:40.349
Amy, they could be monitoring
our communications.

00:11:40.349 --> 00:11:42.952
Huh? What are you saying?

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:45.888
You expect us to carry
the parts there?

00:11:45.888 --> 00:11:47.923
I can take you guys over.

00:11:47.923 --> 00:11:49.258
Oh, really?

00:11:49.258 --> 00:11:51.427
Sure! I'm a warm-hearted reptile.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.836
Okay. Hang on, everybody!

00:12:00.836 --> 00:12:02.238
EGGMAN: Vector, I'm
in your restaurant.

00:12:02.238 --> 00:12:03.305
We need to talk.

00:12:03.305 --> 00:12:04.740
That figures.

00:12:05.774 --> 00:12:08.377
Oh! What's Eggman doing here?

00:12:08.377 --> 00:12:11.247
I'd like to give him a piece
of my mind... and fist.

00:12:11.247 --> 00:12:14.617
Don't worry. I'll go show
Dr. Egghead the exit.

00:12:14.617 --> 00:12:15.985
Be right back.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.290
I already told ya, I'm not
gonna help ya, Eggman.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.125
If you're this rude
to all your customers,

00:12:23.125 --> 00:12:25.194
it's no wonder this place is empty.

00:12:25.194 --> 00:12:26.996
What does he want anyway?

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:28.497
Eggman's a pain.

00:12:28.497 --> 00:12:30.399
We're closed up for the night.

00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:32.501
I'm not leaving this stool.

00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:34.069
Oh, really?

00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:36.171
I came here tonight to celebrate,

00:12:36.171 --> 00:12:38.741
and that's exactly what
I'm going to do, Vector.

00:12:38.741 --> 00:12:40.743
Celebrate what?

00:12:40.743 --> 00:12:42.244
Before this night is over,

00:12:42.244 --> 00:12:45.581
I'm going to be rid of Sonic
the Hedgehog once and for all.

00:12:45.581 --> 00:12:47.516
The Metarex sent me
to track down Sonic,

00:12:47.516 --> 00:12:50.085
and now I figured out
exactly where he's hiding.

00:12:50.085 --> 00:12:51.053
[Laughing]

00:12:51.053 --> 00:12:52.621
Sonic doesn't suspect anything,

00:12:52.621 --> 00:12:55.457
so he won't stand a chance
when the Metarex attack.

00:12:55.457 --> 00:12:57.760
So Eggman is setting us up!

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.061
This is bad.

00:12:59.061 --> 00:13:00.462
What'll we do, Sonic?

Huh? No way!

00:13:22.451 --> 00:13:24.853
Vector was supposed
to get rid of Eggman.

00:13:24.853 --> 00:13:27.222
Yeah. What's he letting
him hang around for?

00:13:27.222 --> 00:13:30.125
Huh. Dr. Eggman doesn't get
to defeat us very often,

00:13:30.125 --> 00:13:33.228
so he really deserves
to enjoy it this time.

00:13:33.228 --> 00:13:34.196
ALL: Huh?

00:13:38.033 --> 00:13:40.569
Let me tell you, those Metarex
aren't kidding around.

00:13:40.569 --> 00:13:43.472
They've had enough of Sonic and
his friends, and this time,

00:13:43.472 --> 00:13:45.040
they're planning to pull
out all the stops to

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.509
make sure he's destroyed
once and for all.

00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:49.912
Really? What are they gonna do?

00:13:49.912 --> 00:13:51.380
It's a secret.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.849
Let's just say it will involve
a whole fleet of ships

00:13:53.849 --> 00:13:55.250
attacking the Blue Typhoon.

00:13:57.286 --> 00:13:59.922
I almost wish I could give
Sonic some kind of warning.

00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:01.890
I'm sure he'd much
rather be beaten by me

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.726
than by those miserable Metarex.

00:14:03.726 --> 00:14:05.494
[Evil chuckle]

00:14:05.494 --> 00:14:07.162
Eggman's got some ego.

00:14:07.162 --> 00:14:09.465
I wish I could go in
there and tell him off!

00:14:09.465 --> 00:14:10.432
Hmm.

00:14:12.368 --> 00:14:13.335
Hah!

00:14:13.869 --> 00:14:14.903
Heh.

00:14:15.904 --> 00:14:17.439
I'll be shoving off now.

00:14:17.439 --> 00:14:20.342
I don't want to ever see
you in here again, Eggman!

00:14:20.342 --> 00:14:23.245

What now?

00:14:32.254 --> 00:14:33.655
I thought you should know,

00:14:33.655 --> 00:14:35.657
I just spotted Bay Leaf's fleet.

00:14:35.657 --> 00:14:37.860
All right, keep me posted.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.896
Oh, well. I guess Sonic's a goner.

00:14:40.896 --> 00:14:43.432
That fleet will stay in
orbit around the planet,

00:14:43.432 --> 00:14:46.902
waiting for the Blue Typhoon to
take off so they can destroy it.

00:14:46.902 --> 00:14:49.238
Yes, the second the
Metarex spot that ship,

00:14:49.238 --> 00:14:51.340
it will be blown
into a billion bits!

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:54.443
There won't be any escape
for Sonic the Hedgehog...

00:14:54.443 --> 00:14:55.844

Ha! He could use an acting coach.

00:14:59.348 --> 00:15:02.551
We can't leave the planet
now even if we fix the ship.

00:15:02.551 --> 00:15:04.753
But if we just stay
here, sooner or later,

00:15:04.753 --> 00:15:07.122
they'll track us down
and attack us anyway.

00:15:07.122 --> 00:15:09.825
We're trapped, and we
can't put up a fight.

00:15:09.825 --> 00:15:13.529
Our laser cannons aren't powerful
enough to take on an entire fleet.

00:15:13.529 --> 00:15:15.931
Thanks for the tip-off, Eggman.

00:15:23.439 --> 00:15:25.941
I'm waiting for you, Sonic!

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:30.979

Metarex have in their fleet?

I disconnected all the
scopes to make repairs,

to reconnect them.

What are the options?

If we just sit around here, we won't
have any chance of getting away.

00:15:45.894 --> 00:15:47.262
What should we do?

00:15:47.262 --> 00:15:51.066
We have to repair our ship
and take on that fleet.

You wanna to join us?

play it safe, than be sorry.

never come back here.

want to come back.

I'll have a prune juice
and a soft-boiled egg.

00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:33.044
Well, Vector?

00:17:33.577 --> 00:17:34.612
Hmm.

00:17:36.414 --> 00:17:38.082
Give him what he wants.

00:17:39.016 --> 00:17:40.418
Are you sure?

00:17:42.787 --> 00:17:44.722
Yeah, and it's all
on the house, too.

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:47.258
Hmm.

00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:06.143
Here's to my best enemy.

00:18:23.794 --> 00:18:25.629
Why did we have to protect Sonic?

00:18:25.629 --> 00:18:28.966
Yeah, I though Dr. Eggman
wanted to see him destroyed.

00:18:28.966 --> 00:18:31.769
If ya ask me, the Doc's
starting to go soft...

00:18:31.769 --> 00:18:33.704
in the head!

00:18:42.046 --> 00:18:45.649
I thought there was supposed to
be a Metarex fleet waiting for us.

00:18:45.649 --> 00:18:48.285
But there isn't even
a single ship here.

00:18:48.285 --> 00:18:50.988
We should have suspected
all along it was a lie.

00:18:50.988 --> 00:18:53.758
I guess Eggman was just
trying to psych us out.

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:55.226
I'm glad he lied.

00:18:55.226 --> 00:18:57.795
If there was a fleet
here, we'd be in trouble.

00:18:57.795 --> 00:18:59.497
Wouldn't we, Sonic?

00:19:13.144 --> 00:19:14.712
Thanks, Doctor.

00:19:14.712 --> 00:19:17.481
You're not such a
bad egg after all.
