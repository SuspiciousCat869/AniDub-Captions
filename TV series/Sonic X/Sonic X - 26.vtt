00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:02.436
Last time on "Sonic X."

00:00:02.536 --> 00:00:05.172
Dr. Eggman sent a strange
new robot named Lucky

00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:07.441
to search
for the last Chaos Emerald.

00:00:07.541 --> 00:00:09.943
Meanwhile, Knuckles decided
the only way to get back home

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:12.980
was to convince the others
to join up with Dr. Eggman,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.314
get all seven Emeralds
together,

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:16.049
and create Chaos Control.

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:19.019
Eggman pretended to agree
and fooled Knuckles and Chris

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.088
into handing over
their Chaos Emeralds

00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:23.023
and then escaped
with Chris held hostage.

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:25.792
Can Sonic make it in time
to get back the Chaos Emeralds

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:27.194
and save his friend?

00:00:27.294 --> 00:00:30.130
Stay tuned.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.865
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:33.400
Gotta go fast

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.569
Gotta go fast

00:00:35.669 --> 00:00:38.605
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.677
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:45.479
Got ourselves a situation

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.781
Stuck in a new location

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:51.318
Without any explanation

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:53.453
No talk of relaxation

00:00:53.587 --> 00:00:55.088
Don't, don't, don't

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:56.890
Don't blink, don't think

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.692
Just go, go, go, go

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:00.193
Go, go

00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:05.732
Sonic is on the run

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:07.601
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:11.338
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:12.839
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.841
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:17.411
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:17.511 --> 00:01:19.313
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:21.682
Sonic X

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:24.518
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:01:24.618 --> 00:01:26.587
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:01:26.687 --> 00:01:28.488
Sonic X

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.895
Good morning, children.

00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:36.830
Come on, it's time to play.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.398
Look, everybody.

00:01:38.532 --> 00:01:40.834
It's my favorite TV star.

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:42.536
[Laughter]

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:46.940
Huh? [Gasps]

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.176
- GIRL: It's him!
- Dr. Eggman!

00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:51.278
He's back again!

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.382
What's he up to?

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:57.484
Whatever it is, it's not good.

00:01:57.584 --> 00:01:59.620
[All shout]

00:01:59.753 --> 00:02:01.288
That was Sonic!

00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:08.061
DEKOE: Dr. Eggman,
Sonic is following us.

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:09.129
Sonic, hurry!

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.397
He is gaining on us.

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:11.632
We have to do something.

00:02:11.732 --> 00:02:13.133
Who cares about him,

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:18.038
especially when the seventh
Chaos Emerald is waiting for me?

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:19.973
[Beeping]

00:02:21.775 --> 00:02:23.644
MAN:
Eggman's ship is making its way

00:02:23.744 --> 00:02:25.679
toward Station Square, sir.

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:29.182
What measures are being taken?
A total evacuation?

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:30.417
WOMAN:
Yes, Mr. President.

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:32.719
While we're not sure exactly
where Eggman is headed,

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.522
we have begun evacuation
of the entire southern region.

00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:37.991
Everything is under control.

00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:39.793
I've been dreading
something like this,

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:43.563
but now that the time has come,
I just hope we're ready for it.

00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:44.865
Thank you.

00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:49.102
Mr. President, sir, we've just
received word from the field.

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:52.673
The beetles are being put
into place.

00:02:52.773 --> 00:02:55.575
Well, it won't be long now.

00:02:55.676 --> 00:02:58.011
We'll all have to wait and see.

00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:01.148
There's nothing more
any of us can do.

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:06.420
Nothing but hope for the best
and prepare for the worst.

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:12.192
Just keep her steady.

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:13.593
He can't be far.

00:03:13.694 --> 00:03:17.197
Just give it a bit more,
and let's go get him, Tails.

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:22.169
ROUGE:
Topaz, it's gorgeous!

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.670
It's okay.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.673
I just don't know what to say.

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:29.109
If you don't like it,
I can take it back, Rouge.

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.877
I don't really know anything
about jewelry,

00:03:30.977 --> 00:03:33.480
so I asked a sales clerk,
and she helped me pick it out.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.015
It's dreamy.

00:03:35.115 --> 00:03:37.184
It's nice.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.687
Thanks, Topaz.

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:44.591
You deserve it.

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:47.194
I just wanted to thank you
for your help.

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:55.302
I really messed up.

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:57.471
How could I have
trusted Eggman?

00:03:57.571 --> 00:04:00.040
[Beeping]

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:04.978
Ahh.

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:07.180
There's my little
good-luck charm.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.117
I just knew he'd bring back
the Chaos Emerald.

00:04:10.217 --> 00:04:12.219
I am surprised
he did not drop it.

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.054
He sure is a klutz, isn't he?

00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:16.490
Hey, he is a bit clumsy.

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:18.592
I'd better grab that Emerald.

00:04:18.692 --> 00:04:22.562
Lucky, come to Daddy!

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:27.501
Sorry, Pops,
you gotta be faster than that.

00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:28.368
Ugh!

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:31.772
Why does that heinous hedgehog
always have to ruin everything?

00:04:31.872 --> 00:04:34.007
That is just our luck.
Bad!

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:36.943
[Beeping]

00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:38.078
Huh?

00:04:38.178 --> 00:04:40.680
But my Emerald!

00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:42.215
Ha ha.
Don't worry.

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:44.184
I'll keep it
safe and sound for you.

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.019
All right!

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:48.989
Don't even think about it,
Sonic!

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:51.191
That Chaos Emerald is mine,
do you hear me?

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:52.325
Mine!

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:53.593
He would not dare!

00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:56.163
We must do something, Doctor!

00:04:58.598 --> 00:04:59.599
Too bad.

00:04:59.733 --> 00:05:01.168
You just missed me.

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:03.804
Nice try, though, Doc.

00:05:03.904 --> 00:05:06.139
Was it your idea
to send those robots?

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:08.275
I do not get ideas, Doctor.

00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:09.509
Good boy.

00:05:09.609 --> 00:05:10.710
[Chuckles]

00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:13.213
Where are they coming from,
Doctor?

00:05:14.181 --> 00:05:15.215
Huh?

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:18.285
Beetle One to Beetle Two,
we're in position.

00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:20.954
Hang on.
Sonic's in the line of fire.

00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:23.490
Sonic, this is an official
government operation.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.691
Please stand aside.

00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:26.560
I repeat, stand aside.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.195
We are launching an attack.

00:05:28.295 --> 00:05:31.464
Attack? But my friend Chris
is trapped inside there!

00:05:31.565 --> 00:05:32.699
Whoa! Ah!

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:33.934
We can't waste time.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.635
Open fire.

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:43.710
Those fools.
How dare they attack me?

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:44.811
You gotta listen!

00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:47.848
My friend Chris is... Aah!

00:05:53.587 --> 00:05:54.988
Aah!

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:07.334
My, my, that was a close one.

00:06:07.434 --> 00:06:10.337
It is a good thing we put
the Egg Shield up in time.

00:06:10.437 --> 00:06:12.973
Next time,
we may not be so lucky.

00:06:13.073 --> 00:06:14.307
Quiet!

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:17.110
Don't you mention that traitor
again, you hear?

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.112
Now, let me see.

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:21.848
How can I get
my Chaos Emerald back?

00:06:21.948 --> 00:06:24.050
Doctor, look at this.

00:06:24.184 --> 00:06:24.985
At what?

00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:28.088
This is the inside
of their robot.

00:06:28.188 --> 00:06:31.491
It is just like yours, Doctor.

00:06:31.625 --> 00:06:33.860
How dare those
underhanded hoodlums

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.829
steal my ingenious robot designs

00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:38.465
to use in that revoltingly
inferior eyesore

00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:40.267
hunk-of-junk monstrosity!

00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:42.369
I'll show that gang
of sneak thieves

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:44.738
what happens
when they cross Dr. Eggman.

00:06:44.838 --> 00:06:47.307
Please, Doctor, do not be rash.

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:49.075
Lucky is inside there.

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:50.443
Don't worry about him.

00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:53.113
With his dumb luck, he'll come
out without a scratch.

00:06:53.213 --> 00:06:54.481
I would not count on it.

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:56.716
Fire!

00:07:04.858 --> 00:07:05.992
Hey, cool it, Eggman!

00:07:06.126 --> 00:07:07.494
Somebody might get hurt!

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:09.362
That was the idea.

00:07:09.462 --> 00:07:12.232
Launch Egg Beam Cannonball!

00:07:22.342 --> 00:07:23.510
Ha ha!

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.746
Looks like that one
did the trick!

00:07:26.846 --> 00:07:30.216
One of these days, you are going
to blow up the whole planet.

00:07:30.317 --> 00:07:33.586
It's a distinct possibility,
Bocoe, but I'd rather do that

00:07:33.687 --> 00:07:36.389
than have Sonic get
those Emeralds from me.

00:07:36.489 --> 00:07:38.391
[Beeping]

00:07:39.526 --> 00:07:40.627
That voice.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.462
It was Lucky!

00:07:42.562 --> 00:07:45.899
Not that backward, bumbling,
bad-luck charm again!

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:48.868
The enemy aircraft,
and not a single scratch.

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:51.771
The doctor really knows
how to build a good ship.

00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:53.340
Unfortunately.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.607
I wonder if it's possible

00:07:54.708 --> 00:07:57.377
to be too much of a genius
for your own good.

00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:59.612
I wonder what happened to...

00:07:59.713 --> 00:08:01.614
It's Sonic!

00:08:01.715 --> 00:08:03.083
That answered my question.

00:08:03.183 --> 00:08:06.252
How could that hedgehog survive
the Egg Beam Cannonball?

00:08:06.386 --> 00:08:07.988
It looks like you missed.

00:08:08.088 --> 00:08:10.190
I'll have you know
the Egg Beam Cannonball

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:12.759
is engineered to hit
the bull's-eye every time.

00:08:12.859 --> 00:08:14.995
But Sonic is a hedgehog,
not a bull.

00:08:15.128 --> 00:08:16.896
I'll try to forget
you said that.

00:08:16.997 --> 00:08:18.898
- [Beeping]
- There's no time to waste.

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:20.500
We have to retrieve
our boy Lucky

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.036
and get that seventh
Chaos Emerald before Sonic does.

00:08:23.136 --> 00:08:24.137
BOTH:
Yes, Doctor.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.443
Uh-oh. Eggman's on a mission
to get that Chaos Emerald.

00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:32.645
Not if I can help it.

00:08:32.746 --> 00:08:34.948
It looks like Eggman's ship
is on the move again.

00:08:35.048 --> 00:08:36.883
We got him covered.

00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:41.488
All right, gentlemen,
it is now takeoff time.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.199
Oh, dear, I didn't know
Lucky could fly so high.

00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:54.834
How will we ever catch him?

00:08:54.934 --> 00:08:56.736
What if he drops
the Emerald, Doctor?

00:08:56.836 --> 00:08:59.272
That Emerald doesn't belong
to you, anyway!

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:01.107
Speak only when spoken to!

00:09:06.813 --> 00:09:09.115
Now's my chance.

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:16.623
Wow, that was quite a leap.

00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:18.291
I said knock it off.

00:09:22.695 --> 00:09:24.197
TOGETHER:
Oh.

00:09:24.297 --> 00:09:25.198
Sonic!

00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:27.367
We are in trouble.

00:09:27.467 --> 00:09:30.236
What if he gets that
Chaos Emerald away from Lucky?

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:32.439
That would be very unlucky.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.812
Gotcha.

00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:40.480
Oh, just relax.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.981
I'm your friend, little guy.

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:43.550
I'm not going to hurt you.

00:09:43.683 --> 00:09:45.185
But that Chaos Emerald you found

00:09:45.285 --> 00:09:47.187
is really important
to me and my friends,

00:09:47.287 --> 00:09:49.689
so I'm going to take it
off your hands.

00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:50.690
EGGMAN:
What's he doing?

00:09:50.824 --> 00:09:52.792
Why isn't he flying away?

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:54.294
Hey, this is kind of fun.

00:09:54.394 --> 00:09:56.229
All right.

00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:58.264
There goes your lucky robot,
Doctor.

00:09:58.364 --> 00:10:01.534
He may be lucky,
but he is not very loyal.

00:10:01.634 --> 00:10:02.669
Be quiet!

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:04.704
He dares to betray me, does he?

00:10:04.804 --> 00:10:07.941
I'll show that traitorous
tin can not to mess with me!

00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:10.944
Doctor, are you thinking
what I think you are thinking?

00:10:11.044 --> 00:10:13.446
I think that is
what he is thinking.

00:10:13.546 --> 00:10:14.781
Good thinking.

00:10:14.881 --> 00:10:17.350
For the first time,
I, the great Dr. Eggman,

00:10:17.484 --> 00:10:18.852
will transform the Egg Fort II

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:21.387
into the greatest robot
ever created.

00:10:21.488 --> 00:10:23.656
I was saving it
for a special occasion,

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.658
but why put it off any longer?

00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:28.394
After all, I'm feeling lucky!

00:10:29.262 --> 00:10:30.563
Get ready!

00:10:33.533 --> 00:10:37.037
Begin Egg Fort II
transformation!

00:10:38.405 --> 00:10:41.708
Merge mode number one.

00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:44.745
Merge mode number two.

00:10:44.845 --> 00:10:48.582
Merge mode number three.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.229
[Laughs evilly]

00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:07.634
Say hello to my ultimate robot
creation, the Egg-Sterminator.

00:11:13.707 --> 00:11:14.941
My, my.

00:11:15.042 --> 00:11:17.611
Bet you think you're
pretty impressive, don't you?

00:11:17.711 --> 00:11:19.246
You may be big and strong,

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:22.616
but I bet you don't move
as fast as I do.

00:11:22.749 --> 00:11:25.819
Come on, Egghead,
what are you waiting for?

00:11:25.952 --> 00:11:27.154
Oh, dear.

00:11:27.254 --> 00:11:29.823
He certainly is impatient,
isn't he?

00:11:29.956 --> 00:11:33.660
But I say,
"Why rush into things?"

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.629
The six Chaos Emeralds!

00:11:35.729 --> 00:11:36.630
Don't worry.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.433
I'm keeping them safe and sound
for future use.

00:11:39.533 --> 00:11:42.502
In the meantime, I'll transfer a
bit of energy from each Emerald

00:11:42.602 --> 00:11:46.873
into the Egg-Sterminator
so it can grow stronger.

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.746
[Laughs]

00:11:52.846 --> 00:11:56.650
Guess the Egg-Sterminator's
got him on the run, kid.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.086
He's using the Chaos Emeralds
to beat Sonic,

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:00.987
and it's all my fault.

00:12:05.525 --> 00:12:06.893
I'm sorry!

00:12:08.995 --> 00:12:10.397
Huh?

00:12:14.167 --> 00:12:15.502
Sonic!

00:12:15.602 --> 00:12:17.571
That thing packs quite a punch.

00:12:18.872 --> 00:12:21.441
Yeah, he's got
a good right hook.

00:12:21.541 --> 00:12:23.410
Sonic had better surrender.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:27.814
With six Chaos Emeralds to
power him, my boy is unbeatable.

00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:30.450
Please, Dr. Eggman,
let Sonic go free.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:34.121
I'm afraid I can't do that
just yet, so, sorry.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.661
We're coming, Sonic!

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:44.030
AMY:
Quick, Tails, do something!

00:12:44.131 --> 00:12:47.267
The X Tornado can't do much
of anything now.

00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:49.536
Not without a Chaos Emerald.

00:12:49.636 --> 00:12:52.005
All right, I guess
I'll have to take care

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:54.674
of that hunk of junk myself!

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:55.909
Hold on!

00:12:56.009 --> 00:12:57.744
Whoa!

00:12:57.844 --> 00:12:59.813
MAN:
Target in sight.

00:13:01.047 --> 00:13:02.549
What the...

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:11.758
SONIC: The beetles.

00:13:11.858 --> 00:13:14.060
They've been wiped out!

00:13:14.161 --> 00:13:16.630
Wow. He really is powerful,
isn't he?

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.532
Good thing he is on our side.

00:13:18.632 --> 00:13:20.300
Even I'm impressed.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.568
SONIC:
Eggman!

00:13:21.668 --> 00:13:23.603
Listen up.

00:13:23.703 --> 00:13:28.341
I'm coming for Chris, and
you better not try to stop me.

00:13:28.441 --> 00:13:31.645
How could Sonic survive
a pounding like that?

00:13:31.745 --> 00:13:32.812
I don't get it.

00:13:32.913 --> 00:13:35.615
He ought to be
Egg-Sterminated by now.

00:13:35.749 --> 00:13:36.750
So he should.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:39.586
That hedgehog is much
more resilient than I thought.

00:13:39.719 --> 00:13:40.854
SONIC:
I'm coming, Chris!

00:13:40.954 --> 00:13:43.590
He's sure is a glutton
for punishment.

00:13:43.723 --> 00:13:44.958
What's going on?

00:13:45.091 --> 00:13:47.861
Egg-Sterminator,
quit wasting power, will you?

00:13:47.961 --> 00:13:51.131
We must conserve
between battles.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.734
[Grunting]

00:13:58.738 --> 00:14:00.707
Can't you move in a bit closer?

00:14:00.807 --> 00:14:03.043
No way.
It's too dangerous.

00:14:03.143 --> 00:14:05.745
He must be using the Emeralds
to power that thing.

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:07.781
Think, Knuckles, think.

00:14:13.753 --> 00:14:15.055
Sonic!

00:14:15.155 --> 00:14:16.556
Sonic!

00:14:16.656 --> 00:14:19.492
ALL:
Huh?

00:14:19.593 --> 00:14:20.860
All right, Egg-Sterminator.

00:14:20.961 --> 00:14:23.196
Enough fooling around.
Drop him already.

00:14:23.296 --> 00:14:24.564
Good idea.

00:14:29.769 --> 00:14:31.504
[Shouting]

00:14:31.605 --> 00:14:33.473
[Whimpers]

00:14:47.354 --> 00:14:49.256
No!

00:14:51.091 --> 00:14:52.692
Why, you...

00:14:54.127 --> 00:14:55.495
Aah!

00:14:55.595 --> 00:14:57.063
My Emeralds!

00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:04.971
They're mine.
Mine.

00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:07.807
I won't.

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:12.979
I won't let you take them
away from me ever again.

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:13.980
Ever.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.284
That mealymouthed little crybaby
shouldn't be so reckless.

00:15:17.384 --> 00:15:20.253
After all, those Emeralds are
powering the Egg-Sterminator.

00:15:20.353 --> 00:15:23.657
Without them, this thing would
be sent plummeting into the sea!

00:15:23.757 --> 00:15:25.859
It is interesting, Doctor.

00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:28.928
As a matter of fact, we should
be plummeting any moment now.

00:15:29.029 --> 00:15:33.166
I am sorry, Doctor, but
did you just say "plummeting"?

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:36.069
- Don't just stand there!
- Yes, Doctor.

00:15:39.639 --> 00:15:41.408
Where is Chris?

00:15:41.508 --> 00:15:43.710
I'm taking him with me.

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.945
Well, if it isn't
our good friend Knuckles.

00:15:46.046 --> 00:15:48.682
How nice of you to drop in
on us for a visit.

00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:50.250
I think he's upset!

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:53.753
He's coming with me,
and that's that.

00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:56.356
I said where is he?

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:58.825
What did you do with Chris?

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:02.062
ROUGE: Enough Emeralds
for a whole necklace

00:16:02.195 --> 00:16:04.597
and maybe some
matching earrings.

00:16:04.698 --> 00:16:07.400
Sonic.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.536
Sonic.

00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:11.705
Let me go.

00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:12.772
No way.

00:16:12.872 --> 00:16:15.108
Not after all the trouble
I went through.

00:16:15.208 --> 00:16:16.776
Sonic.

00:16:17.377 --> 00:16:19.579
Oh, no!

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.449
He made me drop
my Chaos Emeralds.

00:16:22.549 --> 00:16:23.383
Oh.

00:16:30.724 --> 00:16:33.426
Oh, well,
there goes my new jewelry.

00:16:33.526 --> 00:16:35.161
Aah!

00:16:41.394 --> 00:16:43.663
The Egg-Sterminator
is malfunctioning,

00:16:43.763 --> 00:16:45.732
and it's all because
of that thieving brat!

00:16:45.832 --> 00:16:47.333
That's right.

00:16:47.433 --> 00:16:49.102
Where's Chris?

00:16:49.202 --> 00:16:50.737
You're awfully fresh.

00:16:50.837 --> 00:16:52.338
Aah!

00:16:52.438 --> 00:16:54.874
TAILS:
We're coming, Chris!

00:16:56.943 --> 00:16:58.845
Could it be?

00:17:01.414 --> 00:17:03.550
Amy, I think it's Sonic!

00:17:03.716 --> 00:17:07.020
It might be, but where's
that glow coming from?

00:17:09.622 --> 00:17:11.591
Doctor, something is happening!

00:17:11.691 --> 00:17:14.394
The Egg-Sterminator
is losing its grip!

00:17:14.494 --> 00:17:15.895
This is not good.

00:17:15.995 --> 00:17:17.964
What do we do now, Doctor?

00:17:18.064 --> 00:17:19.299
We do nothing.

00:17:19.399 --> 00:17:20.700
Right at this very moment,

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.203
those seven Chaos Emeralds
are mingling together

00:17:23.303 --> 00:17:25.371
way down in the bottom
of the sea.

00:17:25.471 --> 00:17:27.640
The great moment
has finally come.

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:30.143
Are you saying
what I think you are saying?

00:17:30.243 --> 00:17:32.979
Yes, I think that is
what he is saying.

00:17:33.112 --> 00:17:35.014
Let Chaos Control begin.

00:17:47.927 --> 00:17:50.730
Well, Knuckles,
your wish came true,

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:53.566
but I got some
unfinished business.

00:17:53.666 --> 00:17:55.535
Take this, Eggman.

00:18:05.878 --> 00:18:07.213
Oh, no.

00:18:07.313 --> 00:18:09.849
I think we're in Chaos Control.

00:18:09.983 --> 00:18:11.651
It's Chaos Control, Chuck.

00:18:11.751 --> 00:18:13.152
You'll be sent back with us.

00:18:13.253 --> 00:18:15.855
Don't worry.
It'll be my pleasure.

00:18:15.955 --> 00:18:17.590
Hey, look.

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:19.325
Where's that light coming from?

00:18:19.425 --> 00:18:23.696
Does this mean
they're going home?

00:18:23.796 --> 00:18:25.298
Oh, no!

00:18:34.707 --> 00:18:36.976
Can you hear me, pal?

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:38.745
[Groans weakly]

00:18:42.915 --> 00:18:47.720
I'm finally going home,
thanks to you, Chris.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:51.024
Sonic, take me with you, please.

00:18:51.124 --> 00:18:52.892
I don't want to stay here.

00:18:52.992 --> 00:18:55.428
Not without you.

00:19:03.803 --> 00:19:06.139
Ah, Sonic!

00:19:06.239 --> 00:19:09.509
It's going to be okay.
I promise.

00:19:09.642 --> 00:19:11.844
Sonic, please don't leave.

00:19:11.978 --> 00:19:14.047
You're the best friend
I ever had.

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.015
I don't want you to go away!

00:19:16.115 --> 00:19:17.150
[Crying]

00:19:17.283 --> 00:19:19.052
I'll miss you so much!

00:19:19.152 --> 00:19:20.920
Please, don't go!

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:22.722
Please!

00:19:37.303 --> 00:19:40.940
You can't go!

00:20:34.961 --> 00:20:36.596
[All groaning]

00:20:46.439 --> 00:20:48.007
Huh?

00:21:01.254 --> 00:21:04.457
Hey, long time no see.
