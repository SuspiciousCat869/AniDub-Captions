WEBVTT

00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:03.203
Dear Mom, and Dad, and everybody,

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:06.273
I'm sorry to leave
without saying goodbye.

00:00:06.273 --> 00:00:07.741
I knew if I said anything,

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:11.011
you'd try and stop me from trying
to travel to Sonic's world.

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.313
It's very important to me,

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:15.315
so I hope you'll understand.

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:16.650
Don't worry.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.218
I'll be fine.

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:20.520
And, I'll be back.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.955
I'll miss you all.

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:27.494
Mom, and Dad, Grandpa, Danny,
Francis, and Helen...

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:29.429
I love you.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.530
Chris

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.900
P. S. I'll tell Sonic and
the others you said "hello."

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:42.242
ALL: Hey, that's Chris!

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:44.177
CHRIS: It worked!

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:46.613
I-I did it!

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:48.582
I actually did it!

00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:50.216
Sonic!

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:51.618
[Grunt]

00:00:54.287 --> 00:00:55.288
Uh...

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.024
Uh??

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:02.762
Go, go, go, go, go

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:05.865
Gotta go fast

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.802
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:14.608
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:16.676
Got ourselves a situation

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:18.712
Stuck in a new location

00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:22.315
Without any explanation

00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:24.384
No talk of relaxation

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:26.019
Don't, don't, don't

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:27.821
Don't blink, don't think

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:29.623
Just go, go, go, go

00:01:29.623 --> 00:01:31.124
Go, go

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:36.663
Sonic is on the run

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:38.565
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:42.268
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:45.972
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:48.375
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:50.276
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:52.779
Sonic X

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.714
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:57.517
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:01:57.517 --> 00:01:58.551
Sonic X

00:02:03.244 --> 00:02:04.412
What's going on?

00:02:04.412 --> 00:02:05.880
What's with my clothes?

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.482
Did I shrink or something?

00:02:07.482 --> 00:02:09.183
Great to see ya, Chris!

00:02:09.183 --> 00:02:10.251
Tails, it's you!

00:02:10.251 --> 00:02:11.486
We've really missed you.

00:02:11.486 --> 00:02:13.287
It's about time you showed up.

00:02:13.287 --> 00:02:13.955
[Giggling]

00:02:13.955 --> 00:02:15.223
Hey, Amy.

00:02:15.223 --> 00:02:16.591
It's good to see ya.

00:02:16.591 --> 00:02:17.091
[Chuckling]

00:02:17.091 --> 00:02:18.259
[Everyone speaking at once]

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:19.827
Hey, one at a time!

00:02:19.827 --> 00:02:22.730
Sonic, who is that boy?

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.098
He's my friend.

00:02:24.098 --> 00:02:25.099
Ah!

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.434
Hi, Sonic.

00:02:26.434 --> 00:02:28.169
How you doing, pal?

00:02:28.603 --> 00:02:32.173
Sonic, I can't believe
I'm really here.

00:02:32.173 --> 00:02:34.075
It's been a long time coming.

00:02:34.075 --> 00:02:36.878
I knew you'd get here
sooner or later, buddy.

00:02:36.878 --> 00:02:38.880
You haven't changed a bit.

00:02:39.347 --> 00:02:42.950
Come to think of it,
none of you have.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.085
Huh?

00:02:44.085 --> 00:02:46.254
Doesn't look like you
changed much, either,

00:02:46.254 --> 00:02:47.789
except for the baggy clothes.

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:50.091
Is that some new
style, or something?

00:02:50.091 --> 00:02:51.793
No, I don't know what's going on.

00:02:51.793 --> 00:02:52.593
[Groaning]

00:02:52.593 --> 00:02:53.661
Huh?

00:02:53.661 --> 00:02:55.329
Sonic!

00:02:55.897 --> 00:02:57.331
Sonic, what's wrong?

00:02:57.331 --> 00:02:58.132
Huh?

00:02:58.132 --> 00:03:00.268
What happened? Say something!

00:03:00.268 --> 00:03:02.036
Why isn't he waking up?

00:03:02.036 --> 00:03:03.004
He's okay.

00:03:03.004 --> 00:03:04.972
I think he's just exhausted.

00:03:04.972 --> 00:03:07.875
Yeah, I guess he still has
to recover from that battle.

00:03:08.743 --> 00:03:10.978
Sonic got injured in a battle?

00:03:14.182 --> 00:03:15.516
[Sighing]

00:03:16.851 --> 00:03:18.786
You rest now, Sonic.

00:03:19.353 --> 00:03:22.790
Your friend Sonic was
fighting against a Metarex.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.925
A Metarex?

00:03:23.925 --> 00:03:25.860
I don't know how many there are,

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.996
but they've been attacking
planets all over the galaxy.

00:03:29.964 --> 00:03:33.835
Their goal is to unify all the
planets under one absolute rule.

00:03:33.835 --> 00:03:36.571
KNUCKLES: Let me
guess—their rule.

00:03:36.571 --> 00:03:37.839
That's right.

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:40.975
They've already extinguished
so many planets.

00:03:40.975 --> 00:03:43.177
What do you mean, "extinguished?"

00:03:43.177 --> 00:03:45.613
The Metarex don't
just conquer planets,

00:03:45.613 --> 00:03:47.048
they take the Planet Eggs.

00:03:47.048 --> 00:03:47.615
The what?

00:03:47.615 --> 00:03:50.485
The Planet Eggs are like
the hearts of planets.

00:03:50.485 --> 00:03:54.355
Without them, planets lose their
power to nurture and sustain life.

00:03:54.355 --> 00:03:58.693
They become just cold, barren
rocks drifting through space.

00:03:58.693 --> 00:04:00.761
And now that they've
taken your Planet Egg,

00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:03.764
your world will soon wither
away just like the others have.

00:04:03.764 --> 00:04:05.500
Our planet will die?

00:04:06.267 --> 00:04:07.702
That's right.

00:04:07.702 --> 00:04:11.339
Excuse my asking, but how do we
know you're not on their side?

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:12.673
Because I'm not!

00:04:12.673 --> 00:04:13.875
The Metarex are vicious,

00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:16.310
and they'll wipe out anything
that gets in their way.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.746
I am not with them.
You have to believe me!

00:04:18.746 --> 00:04:20.581
I wish I could.

00:04:20.581 --> 00:04:22.283
At least let's hear her out.

00:04:22.283 --> 00:04:24.485
I came here so that
what happened to me,

00:04:24.485 --> 00:04:26.587
might not happen to all of you.

00:04:26.587 --> 00:04:28.122
My planet is gone.

00:04:28.122 --> 00:04:31.626
Everyone I loved—my
family, my friends are..

00:04:32.927 --> 00:04:36.230
[Crying] Everything...
everything is gone!

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.967
[Sobbing]

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:43.037
She's calmed down a little.

00:04:43.037 --> 00:04:44.572
I think she'll be okay.

00:04:44.572 --> 00:04:47.875
I can't believe Knuckles was giving
that poor thing such a hard time.

00:04:47.875 --> 00:04:51.979
I can't believe you built a teleporting
machine in only six months.

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:53.748
Only six months?

00:04:54.148 --> 00:04:57.051
No wonder you all look
exactly as I remember you.

00:04:57.051 --> 00:04:59.453
Chris is acting kind of funny, Amy.

00:04:59.453 --> 00:05:01.055
Don't forget, he's human.

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.559
Back home, it's been six
years since I saw you.

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:07.795
I guess I still have a lot
to learn about teleportation.

00:05:07.795 --> 00:05:09.297
If it's been six years,

00:05:09.297 --> 00:05:10.798
how come you still look the same?

00:05:10.798 --> 00:05:13.301
I'm just as confused
as you are, Tails.

00:05:13.301 --> 00:05:14.268
[Giggling]

00:05:14.268 --> 00:05:16.170
We'll figure it out.

00:05:17.772 --> 00:05:18.906
[Gasp]

00:05:18.906 --> 00:05:19.907
Sonic's gone!

00:05:19.907 --> 00:05:20.975
Oh, no!

00:05:20.975 --> 00:05:23.177
He must have gone out the window!

00:05:23.177 --> 00:05:25.146
He doesn't even say goodbye!

00:05:26.113 --> 00:05:27.848
That's Sonic for ya.

00:05:27.848 --> 00:05:29.784
No matter what, he just takes off.

00:05:29.784 --> 00:05:32.019
He can't even stay still
when he's passed out.

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:34.222
I'm just glad he's okay.

00:05:47.134 --> 00:05:49.070
That's weird.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.371
There's no wind.

00:05:50.371 --> 00:05:52.373
Something's not right.

00:05:52.373 --> 00:05:54.275
I don't trust that Cosmo.

00:05:54.275 --> 00:05:56.844
So is it true, Knuckles?

00:05:56.844 --> 00:05:58.379
Is what true, Rouge?

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:02.116
A little birdie told me that all
seven Chaos Emeralds were gone.

00:06:02.116 --> 00:06:03.217
It's true.

00:06:03.217 --> 00:06:06.120
Sonic thought it'd be a good
idea to scatter them into space.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.957
And not only that, but Chris teleported
here from his world somehow.

00:06:09.957 --> 00:06:11.559
Things are crazy here.

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:13.427
A Metarex attacks, then Cosmo—

00:06:13.427 --> 00:06:15.329
See you around, Knuckie!

00:06:15.329 --> 00:06:17.265
Hey, Rouge!

00:06:17.265 --> 00:06:18.866
Come back here!

00:06:18.866 --> 00:06:21.602
You've got a lot of nerve flying
off while I'm still talking!

00:06:22.036 --> 00:06:23.604
Rouge!

00:06:25.106 --> 00:06:27.074
These should fit a little better.

00:06:28.042 --> 00:06:30.278
They're like your old
clothes, aren't they?

00:06:30.278 --> 00:06:31.879
They sure are.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.414
Thanks.

00:06:33.414 --> 00:06:34.882
Man, this is embarrassing.

00:06:34.882 --> 00:06:37.018
Chao chao chao chao
chao! Chao chao!

00:06:37.018 --> 00:06:38.619
Such a pretty place.

00:06:38.619 --> 00:06:40.087
I'm glad you like it.

00:06:40.087 --> 00:06:41.389
Our planet's great.

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:42.890
Maybe you can learn
to love it here.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:43.858
Maybe.

00:06:43.858 --> 00:06:44.825
Chao chao chao

00:06:44.825 --> 00:06:46.661
She doesn't understand.

00:06:46.661 --> 00:06:48.596
Without the Planet Egg,

00:06:49.397 --> 00:06:51.499
her planet cannot survive.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.603
You know, Cream, if we don't
get the Planet Egg back...

00:06:55.603 --> 00:06:56.570
We will.

00:06:57.438 --> 00:06:59.373
We have Sonic on our side.

00:06:59.373 --> 00:07:00.875
He'll make everything okay.

00:07:00.875 --> 00:07:01.676
Chao chao

00:07:01.676 --> 00:07:05.079
But, Cream, Sonic isn't strong
without the Chaos Emeralds.

00:07:06.047 --> 00:07:08.215
Well, then, I guess we'll
just have to go find 'em.

00:07:08.215 --> 00:07:10.051
I wish you had them now.

00:07:10.051 --> 00:07:11.886
Maybe there was something
I could have done

00:07:11.886 --> 00:07:14.188
instead of sending the
Chaos Emeralds away,

00:07:14.188 --> 00:07:16.490
but it seemed like a
good idea at the time.

00:07:19.894 --> 00:07:22.163
Chaos Control!

00:07:31.205 --> 00:07:32.173
Oh.

00:07:33.674 --> 00:07:36.577
At least he didn't
get the Emeralds.

00:07:36.577 --> 00:07:39.847
You must have been pretty wiped
out after fighting that thing.

00:07:39.847 --> 00:07:40.815
I was.

00:07:40.815 --> 00:07:43.718
When I transformed into Super
Sonic, I thought it'd be a cinch.

00:07:43.718 --> 00:07:45.019
But boy, was I wrong.

00:07:45.019 --> 00:07:46.587
Sonic, listen.

00:07:46.587 --> 00:07:49.090
The Metarex are extremely powerful.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:50.424
They've traveled through space

00:07:50.424 --> 00:07:53.060
and taken every Egg from every
planet they've encountered.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.630
There's nothing to worry about as
long as Sonic's on the scene, Cosmo!

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:00.067
We'll get all the Planet
Eggs back, I promise.

00:08:00.067 --> 00:08:02.403
A dangerous quest in outer space...

00:08:02.403 --> 00:08:05.072
Could anything be more romantic?

00:08:05.072 --> 00:08:07.908
Cheese and I wouldn't miss
an adventure like this.

00:08:07.908 --> 00:08:10.044
You can count me in, Sonic.

00:08:10.044 --> 00:08:11.479
I want to go, too.

00:08:11.479 --> 00:08:14.782
I've been waiting six years to
have another adventure with you.

00:08:14.782 --> 00:08:16.717
Great! Then it's settled.

00:08:16.717 --> 00:08:19.053
We're going into outer space.

00:08:19.053 --> 00:08:21.989
CHRIS: Tails, to go into space,

00:08:21.989 --> 00:08:23.457
won't we need a spaceship?

00:08:23.457 --> 00:08:25.092
[Chuckling] Ta da!

00:08:25.626 --> 00:08:27.094
[All gasp]

00:08:30.798 --> 00:08:31.766
Ahh!

00:08:31.766 --> 00:08:33.033
[Whistling]

00:08:33.033 --> 00:08:34.301
It's so big!

00:08:34.301 --> 00:08:37.838
It's a multipurpose, fully
mobile flying fortress!

00:08:37.838 --> 00:08:39.874
I call it the Blue Typhoon.

00:08:39.874 --> 00:08:41.442
And, with a few quick adjustments,

00:08:41.442 --> 00:08:43.177
it can even fly into space.

00:08:43.177 --> 00:08:43.978
Only...

00:08:43.978 --> 00:08:44.779
Only, what?

00:08:44.779 --> 00:08:48.382
I was planning on using the Chaos
Emeralds as the power source.

00:08:48.382 --> 00:08:49.750
Now what are we gonna use?

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.018
Huh...

00:08:51.018 --> 00:08:53.554
Ah, I know what we can use.

00:08:53.554 --> 00:08:55.089
Hmph.

00:08:55.089 --> 00:08:58.025
I shouldn't have told that
batty Rouge anything.

00:08:58.993 --> 00:09:00.361
Huh? [Gasp]

00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:01.762
Oh, no!

00:09:01.762 --> 00:09:04.498
The Master Emerald's gone!

00:09:07.001 --> 00:09:09.236
The readings look good, Chris.

00:09:09.236 --> 00:09:13.374
The Master Emerald ought to give
us enough power to go interstellar.

00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:15.409
What's the idea?

00:09:15.409 --> 00:09:17.978
We're gonna borrow your Master
Emerald for a little while.

00:09:17.978 --> 00:09:19.980
No way! It goes back where it was.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.483
But we need it to
go into outer space.

00:09:23.451 --> 00:09:24.752
Outer space?

00:09:24.752 --> 00:09:26.654
We have to find the
seven Chaos Emeralds

00:09:26.654 --> 00:09:29.356
so we have enough power
to defeat Metarex.

00:09:29.356 --> 00:09:31.258
We're going to travel
across the galaxy,

00:09:31.258 --> 00:09:33.694
battle Metarex, and save planets!

00:09:33.694 --> 00:09:36.130
Doesn't it sound like
the best adventure ever?

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:37.965
It sounds just peachy.

00:09:37.965 --> 00:09:41.202
Now give me back that Emerald, Sonic,
or I'll come up there and take it!

00:09:42.169 --> 00:09:44.638
Listen to you! You
should be ashamed!

00:09:44.638 --> 00:09:47.007
The fate of the entire
galaxy is at stake.

00:09:47.007 --> 00:09:49.276
AMY: But if you won't
listen to reason...

00:09:49.276 --> 00:09:50.311
Gah!

00:09:50.311 --> 00:09:52.480
Maybe I could knock
some reason into you!

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.747
It would be a pleasure.

00:09:53.747 --> 00:09:55.683
Hey, let's calm down!

00:09:55.683 --> 00:09:56.450
[Sounds of struggling]

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.219
Sonic, please help me!

00:09:58.219 --> 00:10:01.388
I'd like to, but I don't get
involved in fights I can't win.

00:10:01.388 --> 00:10:02.656
You're on your own.

00:10:04.592 --> 00:10:08.462
See, If I take these wires and
attach them to the transformer,

00:10:08.462 --> 00:10:10.397
which connects the Master...

00:10:10.397 --> 00:10:11.365
[Grumbling]

00:10:11.365 --> 00:10:13.300
Huh?

00:10:16.737 --> 00:10:21.275
Chris, I'm sorry our planet got invaded
right when you came to visit us.

00:10:21.275 --> 00:10:23.244
Are you kidding? Don't be.

00:10:23.244 --> 00:10:25.513
I haven't been this
excited in years.

00:10:25.513 --> 00:10:26.380
And now that I'm older,

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:29.183
I can be of some use to you guys.

00:10:29.183 --> 00:10:31.452
So, is the initial
take-off sequence ready?

00:10:31.452 --> 00:10:33.754
Prepare to activate
the Master Emerald!

00:10:33.754 --> 00:10:36.724
This reminds me of our times
back in Station Square.

00:10:36.724 --> 00:10:39.326
We should load this ship
with lots of cool gadgets.

00:10:39.326 --> 00:10:41.195
That way, when I tell
Grandpa about them,

00:10:41.195 --> 00:10:42.530
he'll get really jealous.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:44.465
Sounds good to me.

00:10:51.138 --> 00:10:54.174
Do not let them leave the planet.

00:10:54.174 --> 00:10:58.279
Stop the development of the
spacecraft and destroy them.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.687
This should be the last supplies
we have to haul from home.

00:11:09.687 --> 00:11:12.790
Of course, now we have to load
everything onto the ship.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.492
I can hardly believe it.

00:11:14.492 --> 00:11:17.394
Pretty soon we'll be
taking off and speeding-

00:11:20.231 --> 00:11:21.665
Hi, Cosmo!

00:11:21.665 --> 00:11:22.233
Huh?

00:11:22.233 --> 00:11:23.200
Chao chao!

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.536
Would you mind carrying
these downhill, please?

00:11:25.536 --> 00:11:26.737
Oh, okay.

00:11:27.705 --> 00:11:29.206
Are you sure you can handle it?

00:11:29.206 --> 00:11:30.374
I got it.

00:11:30.374 --> 00:11:31.041
[Struggling]

00:11:31.041 --> 00:11:32.276
Woah!

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:34.912
Oh! She doesn't have it!

00:11:34.912 --> 00:11:36.080
Chao!

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.748
I'm okay.

00:11:37.748 --> 00:11:39.683
Cosmo!

00:11:40.317 --> 00:11:41.819
Are you all right?

00:11:41.819 --> 00:11:43.420
I think so.

00:11:45.589 --> 00:11:47.157
[Gasping]

00:11:48.993 --> 00:11:50.928
[All gasping]

00:11:54.865 --> 00:11:56.600
A Metarex.

00:12:01.105 --> 00:12:03.974
Following directive number one—

00:12:03.974 --> 00:12:06.877
destroy the enemy spacecraft.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.551
Adjust. Firing error
296, tangent 8.

00:12:14.318 --> 00:12:15.286
Oof!

00:12:15.419 --> 00:12:17.421
Ah!

00:12:19.323 --> 00:12:20.291
Huh?

00:12:24.828 --> 00:12:27.464
I don't think we're gonna
stop that thing this way.

00:12:27.464 --> 00:12:30.067
You're right, but we gotta to try.

00:12:31.535 --> 00:12:33.604
It is futile for you to oppose us.

00:12:33.604 --> 00:12:36.807
You are never going to
leave this planet alive.

00:12:38.576 --> 00:12:41.145
There's no time.
What's our status?

00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:46.317
I still have a few
adjustments to make,

00:12:46.317 --> 00:12:48.252
but we can work on
those in the air.

00:12:48.252 --> 00:12:49.420
So I guess we're ready.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.688
Let's go!

00:12:52.122 --> 00:12:53.190
You're ready?

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:54.491
We're leaving now?

00:12:54.491 --> 00:12:57.127
Soon, but we have to activate
the Master Emerald first,

00:12:57.127 --> 00:12:58.862
so we need Knuckles.

00:12:58.862 --> 00:13:01.198
Would you mind finding him for me?

00:13:01.732 --> 00:13:03.200
The time's almost here.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.104
Cream, go find Knuckles and tell
him Tails needs him on the ship.

00:13:07.104 --> 00:13:09.707
Cosmo, you come with me and help
me get the supplies aboard.

00:13:10.674 --> 00:13:12.209
What's going on?

00:13:12.209 --> 00:13:15.145
Tails is almost ready to
power up his new ship,

00:13:15.145 --> 00:13:17.748
and he needs Knuckles to
activate the Master Emerald.

00:13:17.748 --> 00:13:19.683
[Gasp]

00:13:20.484 --> 00:13:21.318
[Grunt]

00:13:21.785 --> 00:13:22.686
[Grunt]

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.722
Hey, up here!

00:13:26.657 --> 00:13:28.092
[Grunt]

00:13:28.092 --> 00:13:29.927
Oof!

00:13:30.527 --> 00:13:31.362
Huh!

00:13:35.499 --> 00:13:38.002
Huh? Hey, I think I
finally stopped him!

00:13:41.438 --> 00:13:42.706
I don't think so!

00:13:43.674 --> 00:13:46.744
Wo-woah!

00:13:48.345 --> 00:13:49.580
[Gasp]

00:13:51.315 --> 00:13:53.784
Radar system activated.

00:13:53.784 --> 00:13:54.818
Huh?

00:13:55.819 --> 00:13:58.288
Aah!

00:14:01.592 --> 00:14:02.259
Ah!

00:14:02.259 --> 00:14:06.130
It'd stink to get blasted out of
the sky before we left the ground.

00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:09.033
Ooh!

00:14:10.801 --> 00:14:11.669
[Gasp]

00:14:14.705 --> 00:14:20.010
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!!!

00:14:20.678 --> 00:14:22.613
Happy landing, pal.

00:14:22.613 --> 00:14:24.548
Knuckles!

00:14:24.682 --> 00:14:26.417
Tails needs you on the plane.

00:14:26.417 --> 00:14:28.419
He plans to beat the Metarex.

00:14:28.419 --> 00:14:29.820
I just did.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.255
Ohh!

00:14:32.189 --> 00:14:33.557
[Grunt]

00:14:34.525 --> 00:14:35.359
Oof.

00:14:35.359 --> 00:14:37.361
Go on, Knuckles. I got this guy.

00:14:37.361 --> 00:14:38.328
[Grunt]

00:14:38.996 --> 00:14:40.130
[Breathing deeply]

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.834
You know, Cosmo, you might want
to carry more than one at a time.

00:14:43.834 --> 00:14:45.302
Oh... Right.

00:14:45.302 --> 00:14:48.639
Wo-woah!

00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:51.008
[Giggling] Why don't
you just take it easy?

00:14:54.611 --> 00:14:56.547
The main engine's ready.

00:14:56.547 --> 00:14:58.916
Connecting to the Master Emerald.

00:14:58.916 --> 00:14:59.850
You copy?

00:15:02.086 --> 00:15:04.955
Main engine now connected
to the Master Emerald.

00:15:13.864 --> 00:15:16.767
The seven Chaos Emeralds
are the servers.

00:15:16.767 --> 00:15:19.336
Our hearts intensify their power.

00:15:19.336 --> 00:15:22.606
The controller serves
to unify the Chaos.

00:15:23.207 --> 00:15:27.111
We need your great power
to find the Chaos Emeralds.

00:15:28.779 --> 00:15:30.114
Ignition.

00:15:42.126 --> 00:15:44.628
Okay, the engine's fired up.

00:15:47.598 --> 00:15:48.565
Mother?

00:15:48.565 --> 00:15:49.833
Huh?

00:15:51.735 --> 00:15:55.606
Mother, would it be all right if I
go out into space with everybody?

00:15:55.606 --> 00:15:58.108
You mean on that nice
spaceship that Tails built?

00:15:58.108 --> 00:16:01.145
Sure, sweetie. Just
don't touch any buttons.

00:16:01.512 --> 00:16:03.080
Thanks, Mother.

00:16:03.747 --> 00:16:05.315
Cream!

00:16:05.315 --> 00:16:08.285
Goodbye, Mother. Goodbye.

00:16:09.653 --> 00:16:10.754
Uhh!

00:16:10.754 --> 00:16:11.789
Oof!

00:16:11.789 --> 00:16:12.623
Ugh!

00:16:12.623 --> 00:16:13.590
Ooh!

00:16:13.857 --> 00:16:15.793
Ooh!

00:16:16.527 --> 00:16:17.461
[Grunt]

00:16:20.464 --> 00:16:22.399
Hurry it up, guys!

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:23.400
Huh?

00:16:27.638 --> 00:16:31.508
The acceleration thruster's
almost charged.

00:16:33.944 --> 00:16:35.412
Take-off time.

00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:49.734
You are doomed.

00:16:53.438 --> 00:16:54.372
Great.

00:17:00.611 --> 00:17:01.546
Huh!

00:17:02.113 --> 00:17:05.616
It's been fun, but we have
to be running along now.

00:17:06.617 --> 00:17:08.719
Master Emerald, we need you!

00:17:08.719 --> 00:17:11.122
Release the power of Chaos to us!

00:17:11.122 --> 00:17:12.890
We're almost there...!

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.960
80, 90, 95—!

00:17:16.627 --> 00:17:19.530
The chamber's energy
supply's at full capacity!

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:24.502
Sonic! We're gonna
use the main cannon.

00:17:24.502 --> 00:17:25.570
Stand by!

00:17:29.106 --> 00:17:32.977
Transferring power from the energy
chamber to the main cabin.

00:17:34.345 --> 00:17:38.015
Cannon initiation sequence
now in progress.

00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:39.817
Sequence complete.

00:17:39.817 --> 00:17:41.819
Sonic, do your thing!

00:17:41.819 --> 00:17:43.354
Hm! Here goes!

00:17:51.229 --> 00:17:52.830
Last one.

00:17:53.397 --> 00:17:54.966
Attention everyone—

00:17:54.966 --> 00:17:56.601
brace yourselves!

00:17:56.601 --> 00:17:58.536
[Sigh]

00:18:00.872 --> 00:18:03.774
Target Metarex dead ahead.

00:18:10.147 --> 00:18:12.583
ALL: Sonic Power Cannon, fire!

00:18:36.707 --> 00:18:39.043
Wo-wo-wo-wo-woah!

00:18:44.115 --> 00:18:46.017
Hang on, Sonic!

00:18:46.017 --> 00:18:48.486
Hngggggggggggggh.

00:18:52.123 --> 00:18:53.124
Huh?

00:18:53.558 --> 00:18:55.126
Hi, Chris!

00:18:55.126 --> 00:18:58.029
I got ya!

00:19:02.967 --> 00:19:03.935
Uh!

00:19:04.201 --> 00:19:05.803
Mission accomplished!

00:19:08.539 --> 00:19:10.474
An excellent catch, guys.

00:19:10.474 --> 00:19:12.043
Now get ready!

00:19:12.543 --> 00:19:14.679
Retracting main cannon.

00:19:14.679 --> 00:19:17.014
Re-routing energy to main engine.

00:19:18.816 --> 00:19:20.718
Forward wings deployed.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.622
All right, Blue Typhoon,

00:19:24.622 --> 00:19:26.057
here we go!

00:19:35.866 --> 00:19:37.168
Let's go up to the bridge!

00:19:40.438 --> 00:19:41.505
Uh.

00:19:49.246 --> 00:19:50.014
Hey!

00:19:50.014 --> 00:19:50.982
Hm?

00:19:50.982 --> 00:19:52.416
[Chuckling]

00:19:53.384 --> 00:19:55.186
What a beautiful view.

00:19:55.186 --> 00:19:59.056
I've always wanted to know what our
planet looks like from this high up.

00:20:04.061 --> 00:20:05.963
I wonder what this is.

00:20:05.963 --> 00:20:07.632
You wonder what what is?

00:20:07.632 --> 00:20:09.634
This thing on my head.

00:20:09.634 --> 00:20:12.036
I'm afraid I have some
bad news, Doctor.

00:20:12.036 --> 00:20:14.639
Sonic seems to have discovered
our electronic bug.

00:20:14.639 --> 00:20:16.574
[Evil laughter]

00:20:16.574 --> 00:20:18.709
I planted it on him
before he woke up.

00:20:18.709 --> 00:20:20.444
Clever, aren't I?

00:20:20.444 --> 00:20:24.315
Now, fire up the engines,
and follow that spaceship!

00:20:24.315 --> 00:20:25.616
Roger.

00:20:25.616 --> 00:20:27.585
Engine fired up.

00:20:29.887 --> 00:20:31.555
Don't let them get away!

00:20:31.555 --> 00:20:32.523
Full speed ahead!

00:20:32.523 --> 00:20:33.391
Huh?

00:20:33.391 --> 00:20:36.127
Hey! I give the orders around here!

00:20:36.127 --> 00:20:37.194
Sorry, Doctor!

00:20:37.194 --> 00:20:38.529
Huh.
