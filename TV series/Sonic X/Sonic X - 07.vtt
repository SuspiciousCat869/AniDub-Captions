CHRIS:
Now, remember, Cream.

00:00:02.135 --> 00:00:03.670
You, too, Cheese.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.039
Stay inside while I'm gone,
okay?

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:07.040
Okay.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.041
Chao!

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.344
I'll see you later.

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:20.087
Chao!

00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:23.156
I don't want to stay inside.

00:00:23.257 --> 00:00:26.093
I want to go outside and play.

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:35.302
[Cream giggling]

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:38.572
That sounds like
Cream and Cheese outside.

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:47.714
I wonder what
she's doing out there, Amy.

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:50.417
I bet Cream's out there
gathering some flowers.

00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:51.451
Hmm?

00:00:51.552 --> 00:00:53.854
She knows we're supposed
to stay inside

00:00:53.954 --> 00:00:55.322
while Chris is at school.

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:58.458
What's so important about going
outside to pick flowers?

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.227
Oh.

00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:06.333
[Humming]

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:08.869
Hi, Cream.

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:10.938
What are you doing there?

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:13.240
I'm going to surprise my mom

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.877
by making her a crown
out of flowers.

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:21.582
I guess she misses her mom.

00:01:21.682 --> 00:01:24.217
Of course she does.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:28.855
I just wish we could do
something to cheer her up.

00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:30.591
Hmm?

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:33.393
Hmm.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.169
Huh?
Sonic?

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:43.804
Go, go, go, go, go

00:01:43.904 --> 00:01:45.339
Gotta go fast

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:47.541
Gotta go fast

00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:50.577
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:55.682
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.484
Got ourselves a situation

00:01:57.584 --> 00:01:59.786
Stuck in a new location

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:03.323
Without any explanation

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:05.459
No talk of relaxation

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:07.094
Don't, don't, don't

00:02:07.194 --> 00:02:08.862
Don't blink, don't think

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.697
Just go, go, go, go

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:12.165
Go, go

00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:17.671
Sonic is on the run

00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:19.573
Sonic, he's number one

00:02:19.673 --> 00:02:23.310
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.811
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:02:26.947 --> 00:02:29.383
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:31.284
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:33.687
Sonic X

00:02:33.787 --> 00:02:36.523
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:38.558
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.460
Sonic X

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:51.405
It's marvelous to be back
in the kitchen again.

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:54.641
On my movie sets, the chefs
won't let me cook a thing.

00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:57.144
Here are your
buttermilk pancakes, dear.

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:58.178
Enjoy.

00:02:58.278 --> 00:02:59.713
Mmm.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.088
Oh, my!

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:10.357
I smell something burning!

00:03:10.457 --> 00:03:11.725
[Chuckles]

00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:14.795
Oh, Ella,
it's so good to be home again.

00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:16.530
I have an idea.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.298
Let's have a big party.

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:19.366
Party?

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:21.334
Yes, a dinner party tonight.

00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:22.469
We can all dress up.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.073
I'm sure Ella can prepare
something scrumptious.

00:03:26.173 --> 00:03:27.808
A party's a great idea!

00:03:27.908 --> 00:03:30.444
Do you think you could invite
your brother Sam,

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:32.913
since he's my favorite uncle?

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:35.716
Of course, darling,
you can have anything you want.

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.585
Anything at all
for my adorable baby boy.

00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:40.187
If we're having a party tonight,

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.289
this calls
for heavy-duty cleaning.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.091
Time to clear some clutter!

00:03:44.191 --> 00:03:45.759
[Laughs]

00:03:46.293 --> 00:03:49.396
Wow, a party.

00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:51.131
This is great!

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:53.800
I love parties.

00:03:55.102 --> 00:03:56.169
A party?

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.905
Yeah, my mom wants us
to have fun while she's home.

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:01.475
My uncle's coming
for the party, too.

00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:02.876
The racer?

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:04.644
Yeah, he's the coolest.

00:04:04.778 --> 00:04:07.380
And he's the leader
of the S-Team!

00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:09.382
[Chuckles]

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:16.523
This crown doesn't
have enough flowers.

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:18.759
[Sighs]
We better pick more.

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.093
Chao!

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:24.898
Ooh!

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.303
Maybe I can help
decorate for the party.

00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:31.304
[Squeals]

[Bell ringing]

00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:35.175
GIRL:
What are you doing after school?

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:36.543
Want to go to the mall?

00:04:36.676 --> 00:04:38.378
Bye.

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:41.114
Hey, Chris.

00:04:41.248 --> 00:04:42.649
Huh?

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:44.217
I haven't been
teaching here long,

00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:46.186
but I just wanted to say
"thanks."

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.255
I'm really lucky to have
so many intelligent

00:04:48.355 --> 00:04:50.991
and talented kids in my class.

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:52.726
You kids are terrific

00:04:52.826 --> 00:04:54.761
and I want to know
all of you better,

00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:59.032
so I'm coming to visit you
and your family later today.

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:03.270
I can't wait to meet your
mom and get her autograph.

00:05:12.546 --> 00:05:14.247
Hmm.

00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:23.390
Hey, I'm home!

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.959
How was school today,
Master Christopher?

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:28.261
It was pretty good,
Mr. Tanaka.

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:30.697
Oh, Chris, darling, you're home.

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:32.399
I hope it's okay,

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:35.969
but my teacher Mr. Stewart's
coming over today to visit.

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:39.506
And it sounds like he's a really
big fan of your movies, Mom.

00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:41.341
That reminds me.

00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:43.443
What am I going to wear?

00:05:43.577 --> 00:05:45.879
I should've had the studio
send over a gown.

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:47.514
GRANDPA:
I feel sorry for dogs.

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:48.982
How do they stand it?

00:05:49.082 --> 00:05:51.151
This collar's killing me.

00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:54.154
How come you're wearing
those clothes, Grandpa?

00:05:54.254 --> 00:05:57.691
Mr. Tanaka said I couldn't
wear my lab coat to the party.

00:05:57.824 --> 00:05:59.292
I don't see why not.

00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:02.162
Hey, Grandpa, when you see Sonic
and the others,

00:06:02.262 --> 00:06:04.197
could you ask them
to stay out of sight

00:06:04.297 --> 00:06:06.833
until Mr. Stewart
and my uncle go away?

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:09.469
I know that Amy and Tails
are up in my room,

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.839
but I haven't seen Sonic
or Cream and Cheese all day.

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:14.074
[Squealing]

00:06:14.174 --> 00:06:15.275
Aah!

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:17.277
[Squealing]

00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:20.380
It's Cream and Cheese.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.648
Is something wrong?

00:06:21.781 --> 00:06:23.149
[Both shouting]

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.784
Nothing to see here!

00:06:24.918 --> 00:06:27.487
What's the matter with you two?

00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:29.256
Everything's okay here, Mom.

00:06:29.356 --> 00:06:31.024
You'd better hurry up
and get ready.

00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:35.095
Me and Grandpa will take care
of the rest of the decorating.

00:06:35.195 --> 00:06:36.463
But there's plenty of time.

00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:39.900
But you know how time flies
when you're putting on makeup.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.434
Right, Grandpa?

00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:42.636
Yes!

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:45.772
Don't forget all of the food
that has to be prepared, too.

00:06:45.872 --> 00:06:47.040
[Chuckles]

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.510
Well, I'll go see
how Ella's doing in the kitchen.

00:06:52.946 --> 00:06:54.848
[Squealing]

00:06:55.448 --> 00:06:58.685
What are you two doing here,
Cream?

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:00.954
[Gasps]

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:05.292
Mrs. Thorndyke decorates
like a little kid.

00:07:05.392 --> 00:07:07.594
[Chuckles]

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:10.297
Cream, I asked you
to stay upstairs

00:07:10.397 --> 00:07:12.132
so nobody would see you.

00:07:12.232 --> 00:07:13.900
That room is boring.

00:07:13.967 --> 00:07:16.670
We only wanted to help you
get ready for your party.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.571
MR. TANAKA:
Master Chris understands.

00:07:18.672 --> 00:07:22.208
It is very thoughtful of you
to help us get ready, Cream.

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:25.345
Mr. Tanaka,
you know about these guys?

00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:26.379
Of course.

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:28.014
You knew all along.

00:07:28.148 --> 00:07:29.983
Do you think you could help
me and Grandpa

00:07:30.083 --> 00:07:32.085
keep this a secret
for right now?

00:07:32.218 --> 00:07:33.887
I will.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.956
Thanks a lot.

00:07:36.056 --> 00:07:37.023
Hold on!

00:07:37.157 --> 00:07:38.625
They're gone!

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.134
Cream?

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:49.202
Cheese?

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:52.205
I wonder where
they wandered off to.

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:53.873
MRS. THORND YKE:
Ella!

00:07:53.974 --> 00:07:55.275
Ella!

00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:56.276
Oh!

00:07:56.376 --> 00:07:58.144
What?

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.982
I can't find my green Versace!

00:08:02.082 --> 00:08:04.584
You didn't send it
to the cleaners, did you?

00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:06.786
No, it should be there.

00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:08.655
It's not here!

00:08:08.755 --> 00:08:10.790
I'm on my way.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.360
[Grumbling]

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:18.598
Wow!

00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:20.333
Look at all that food!

00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:22.369
It smells so good.

00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:24.204
Chao!

00:08:24.304 --> 00:08:25.538
Hmm.

00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:30.710
We can help, Cheese.

00:08:32.579 --> 00:08:34.547
[Both screaming]

00:08:35.482 --> 00:08:36.616
[Gasps]

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.986
- Hey, Cream, are you...
- [Ella screaming]

00:08:40.086 --> 00:08:40.787
Aah!

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.655
Cream! Cheese!

00:08:42.756 --> 00:08:43.890
Aah!

00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:45.992
Ella!

00:08:46.092 --> 00:08:47.894
Hey, are you okay?

00:08:47.994 --> 00:08:49.429
[Sighs]

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:52.532
My dinner is a disaster!

00:08:58.338 --> 00:09:00.907
[Whistles]
This is cool.

00:09:14.621 --> 00:09:17.590
This should do,
at least for my entrance.

Hello?

00:09:22.996 --> 00:09:24.397
What's that?

00:09:24.497 --> 00:09:26.733
The starring role?

00:09:27.634 --> 00:09:30.503
I'll catch the next plane.

00:09:30.603 --> 00:09:34.541
Oh, actually I'm having a little
party for my son tonight.

00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:37.377
I'm afraid I'll have to leave
tomorrow morning.

00:09:37.477 --> 00:09:39.546
Oh, I didn't realize.

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:42.982
We have to shoot on location
first thing tomorrow morning.

00:09:43.116 --> 00:09:43.950
I know.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:47.287
You can't put a $100-million
production on hold for a party.

00:09:47.387 --> 00:09:49.189
I'll leave immediately.

00:09:49.289 --> 00:09:50.757
Goodbye.

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:55.929
Why does it always
have to happen this way?

00:09:56.029 --> 00:09:59.132
I don't even have time to spend
with my little boy.

00:09:59.232 --> 00:10:03.503
I may be a great actress,
but I'm a terrible mother.

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:05.472
Please forgive me, Christopher.

Huh? Yeah!

00:10:22.355 --> 00:10:23.723
Mmm.

00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:26.793

Hey, Cheese?

Ah!

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.466
Maybe they went back
to the lab with Grandpa.

00:10:36.603 --> 00:10:38.705
Chris?

00:10:39.372 --> 00:10:41.574
Oh, the poor boy!

00:10:41.674 --> 00:10:43.510
Oh, dear!

00:10:45.612 --> 00:10:48.248
Ma'am, I've looked all over,

00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:50.984
but I'm afraid I couldn't
find Chris anywhere.

00:10:51.117 --> 00:10:54.053
Ella, please tell
Christopher how sorry I am

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:56.623
and apologize to Mr. Stewart
and my brother.

00:10:56.756 --> 00:10:57.924
They'll understand.

00:10:58.024 --> 00:11:00.293
You take care, Mrs. Thorndyke.

00:11:00.393 --> 00:11:02.262
Call me if Chris needs anything.

00:11:02.362 --> 00:11:04.898
Certainly, Mrs. Thorndyke.

00:11:12.272 --> 00:11:13.339
Cream?

00:11:13.439 --> 00:11:15.408
Cheese?

00:11:17.877 --> 00:11:19.612
Huh?

00:11:22.482 --> 00:11:23.483
What?

00:11:23.583 --> 00:11:25.185
They're not here?

00:11:25.818 --> 00:11:28.154
Weren't they with you?

00:11:28.821 --> 00:11:30.690
They're wandering around
someplace,

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.159
and Mr. Stewart's gonna
be here any minute now!

00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:35.228
What am I gonna do
if he sees them?

00:11:35.328 --> 00:11:37.063
Stay calm.
Let's all split up.

00:11:37.163 --> 00:11:39.532
Each one of us will search
a different part of the house

00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:40.533
until we find them.

Welcome, sir.

We've been expecting you.

Hi, come in.

00:12:14.133 --> 00:12:16.202
How are you, Chris?

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.972
Sit down.

00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:22.909
Do you like it?

00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:25.144
Mrs. Thorndyke
isn't only a great actress

00:12:25.278 --> 00:12:26.646
but an artist, too!

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:27.814

Well, it's great.

00:12:29.048 --> 00:12:30.583
I can't wait to meet
Chris' mother

00:12:30.717 --> 00:12:32.051
and give her my compliments.

00:12:32.151 --> 00:12:35.188
I'm very sorry, Mr. Stewart,
but just before you arrived,

00:12:35.288 --> 00:12:37.123
she was offered
an important movie part

00:12:37.223 --> 00:12:39.993
and she had to leave
right away to start filming.

Oh, well, that is too bad.

I was really looking forward
to meeting her in person.

Hmm.

I guess
I'll offer these to you, then.

Why, thank you, Mr. Stewart!

00:12:51.704 --> 00:12:54.841

[Chuckles]
Sorry, Ella.

00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:10.857
I was just leaning out
the window,

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:13.293
and I fell out
and knocked the pots down.

00:13:13.393 --> 00:13:15.128
I don't know what
you think you're up to,

00:13:15.228 --> 00:13:17.363
but you'd better
be on your best behavior

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:19.198
because Chris' teacher is here.

Oh!

00:13:20.733 --> 00:13:22.502
I better come in and say "hi."

00:13:22.602 --> 00:13:26.506
Sir, why can't you just use the
front door like everybody else?

00:13:26.606 --> 00:13:28.508
One way in is as good
as another.

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.177
Oh!

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:32.578
What's the matter, Chris?

00:13:32.712 --> 00:13:34.547
Why did you scream?

00:13:35.214 --> 00:13:36.282
It's nothing!

00:13:36.416 --> 00:13:40.219
Well, my, this certainly
is an extraordinary painting.

Guess what.

00:13:49.762 --> 00:13:52.565
Sonic went out and picked
a whole bunch of pretty flowers

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:54.567
just for me.

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:56.536
You can have some, too,
if you want.

00:13:56.636 --> 00:13:58.037
No, I can't.

00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:00.473
Is this little animal talking?

00:14:00.573 --> 00:14:01.841
Talking animals.

00:14:01.974 --> 00:14:03.009
What a joke.

00:14:03.142 --> 00:14:04.977
Yes, that's some joke.

00:14:05.111 --> 00:14:06.212
Hmm.

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:07.480
Love this painting.

00:14:07.613 --> 00:14:10.783
Thanks for finding my
stuffed-animal toy for me, Ella.

00:14:10.917 --> 00:14:12.785
Can I have it back now?

00:14:12.885 --> 00:14:14.287
Toy?

00:14:14.387 --> 00:14:15.822
Look, I heard
that thing talking,

00:14:15.922 --> 00:14:18.291
and nobody's going
to convince me otherwise.

00:14:18.391 --> 00:14:20.426
Pretend you're a toy.

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:22.962
You'd better quit before I do!

Hey, hey!

00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:26.132
Ha, ha!

00:14:26.232 --> 00:14:28.067
Hey, where's the party?

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:30.870
Uncle Sam,
this is my teacher Mr. Stewart.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.071
A pleasure.

00:14:32.171 --> 00:14:34.974
I understand you're involved
in the Highway Patrol somehow.

00:14:35.074 --> 00:14:38.111
I don't like to brag, but
I'm the leader of the S-Team.

00:14:38.244 --> 00:14:41.647
That statement
is only half correct.

00:14:41.748 --> 00:14:42.648
Really?

00:14:42.749 --> 00:14:44.517
My uncle drives fast!

00:14:44.617 --> 00:14:46.753
No other driver's
quick enough to catch him.

00:14:46.853 --> 00:14:48.788
That's why he's called
the Speed King.

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:51.157
You came up with the name
yourself, didn't you?

00:14:51.257 --> 00:14:52.225
Sure.

00:14:52.325 --> 00:14:55.328
A little self-promotion
never hurt anybody.

00:14:55.862 --> 00:14:58.164
Let's cut the chitchat
and get this party moving.

00:14:58.264 --> 00:14:59.665
It's too slow!

00:14:59.766 --> 00:15:02.135
And your mouth is too fast.

00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:04.337
Ha! I can't help it
that I like speed.

00:15:04.437 --> 00:15:05.571
I've always been fast.

00:15:05.671 --> 00:15:07.974
I even beat the doctor
to the delivery room.

00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:10.743
I was the only kid in town
who had a 5-speed transmission

00:15:10.877 --> 00:15:12.845
in my baby carriage.

00:15:12.979 --> 00:15:13.880
I admit it.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.648
I like living in the fast lane.

00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:17.316
Even when
I'm in the supermarket,

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.887
no matter how many items I have,
I use the express checkout.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.955
I can't even walk my dog.

00:15:23.055 --> 00:15:24.190
I make him run.

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:25.425
[Laughs]

00:15:26.893 --> 00:15:29.929
There's only one guy
who's faster.

00:15:35.201 --> 00:15:37.570
I never saw anything move
that fast.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:38.604
But don't you worry.

00:15:38.704 --> 00:15:40.339
I'll catch up with him some day.

00:15:40.473 --> 00:15:41.474
Really?

00:15:41.574 --> 00:15:42.842
What did he look like?

00:15:42.975 --> 00:15:45.545
It's weird, but he looked like
a blue hedgehog.

00:15:45.678 --> 00:15:47.079
He even had a spike.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.314
Huh?

00:15:49.715 --> 00:15:50.883
Hey!

00:15:50.983 --> 00:15:52.084
There he is!

00:15:52.185 --> 00:15:53.386
Huh?

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.354
There!

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:56.355
Did you see?

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:58.624
It was the blue hedgehog
I was talking about!

00:15:58.724 --> 00:16:01.627
Sorry, I was just
admiring this painting.

00:16:01.727 --> 00:16:03.796
I didn't see anything, did you?

00:16:03.896 --> 00:16:06.132
Perhaps your eyes were
playing tricks on you.

00:16:06.232 --> 00:16:08.468
But I'm telling you, I saw it.

00:16:08.568 --> 00:16:10.603
You saw it, too,
Chris, didn't you?

00:16:10.703 --> 00:16:12.605
Mnh-mnh.

00:16:15.775 --> 00:16:17.577
I saw it!

00:16:17.677 --> 00:16:19.278
My eyes don't lie.

00:16:19.412 --> 00:16:22.181
That thing waved at me
and ran off.

00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:24.650
You know, they thought
I was crazy, too,

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.652
when I heard
that animal talking.

00:16:26.752 --> 00:16:28.287
Animal talking?

00:16:28.387 --> 00:16:29.822
I didn't hear it say anything,

00:16:29.922 --> 00:16:32.325
but I'm sure it could
understand what I said.

00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:34.560
We both saw the same creature.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.996
That proves that I'm not crazy.

00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:39.665
The animal I heard
is over there.

00:16:39.765 --> 00:16:43.102
You know, I'm sorry
Mom can't be here for the party,

00:16:43.202 --> 00:16:46.439
but she got a phone call and
had to leave to make a movie.

00:16:46.572 --> 00:16:48.241
I was pretty mad.

00:16:48.374 --> 00:16:50.843
Mr. Stewart was looking
forward to meeting her,

00:16:50.977 --> 00:16:53.179
but she went away
before he even got here.

00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:54.747
That was pretty rude, huh?

00:16:54.881 --> 00:16:57.984
Well, that sounds like
my sister, all right.

00:16:58.751 --> 00:17:00.953
Please forgive me, Christopher.

00:17:01.053 --> 00:17:03.022

00:17:05.124 --> 00:17:06.459
You're wrong!

00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:08.761
Your mom felt very badly
that she had to go,

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:11.364
and she tried to find you
to say "goodbye".

00:17:11.464 --> 00:17:12.365
You're lucky.

00:17:12.465 --> 00:17:14.867
You get to talk to your mom
all the time on the phone.

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:17.336
I can't do that!
Ahh!

00:17:17.436 --> 00:17:19.071
[Sobbing]

00:17:28.103 --> 00:17:30.071
[Sobbing]

00:17:31.273 --> 00:17:33.875
Well I hope you enjoyed that.

00:17:33.975 --> 00:17:36.678
I've been rehearsing my
ventriloquism act for weeks now.

00:17:36.778 --> 00:17:40.081
And if I do say so myself,
I'm not half bad.

00:17:40.715 --> 00:17:43.618
Ah, yes,
this painting is stunning.

00:17:43.718 --> 00:17:45.754
Cream!

00:17:46.121 --> 00:17:48.557
Come here, Cream!

00:17:48.657 --> 00:17:50.458
I'm seeing more of them now!

00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:53.028
Hey, Ella,
would you care to dance?

00:17:53.128 --> 00:17:54.362
Oh!

00:17:54.496 --> 00:17:55.564
Well, Uncle Sam,

00:17:55.697 --> 00:17:58.166
I hope you can come
and visit me again.

00:17:58.266 --> 00:18:00.101
Yeah, but you know me, Chris.

00:18:00.235 --> 00:18:02.804
It'll have to be a quick visit.

00:18:04.339 --> 00:18:07.075
I guess
I've seen and heard enough.

00:18:10.345 --> 00:18:12.314
[Laughing]

00:18:14.449 --> 00:18:16.017
Chris, I'd better get going.

00:18:16.117 --> 00:18:17.552
I have homework to grade.

00:18:17.652 --> 00:18:19.321
Please give your mother
my regards

00:18:19.421 --> 00:18:21.856
and tell her I hope
we get to meet soon.

00:18:21.957 --> 00:18:24.259
I'm sorry, Mr. Stewart.

00:18:27.195 --> 00:18:28.096
Later, boys.

00:18:28.196 --> 00:18:30.332
See you in my rearview mirror.

00:18:33.201 --> 00:18:34.803
[Sighs]

00:18:34.903 --> 00:18:36.004
Huh?

00:18:36.538 --> 00:18:37.539
Oh, dear!

00:18:37.672 --> 00:18:39.274
I'm working too hard.

00:18:39.374 --> 00:18:41.843
I'm hearing things.

00:18:41.943 --> 00:18:44.045
Mr. Chris, would it not be wise

00:18:44.145 --> 00:18:47.015
to let Ella in on your
little secret, too?

00:18:47.115 --> 00:18:48.016
He's right.

00:18:48.116 --> 00:18:51.019
Things would be a lot easier
if she were in on it, too.

00:18:51.119 --> 00:18:53.288
Sure, okay.

00:18:53.955 --> 00:18:55.991
Hey, Ella?

00:18:56.091 --> 00:18:56.992
Listen.

00:18:57.092 --> 00:18:57.993
It's like this.

00:18:58.126 --> 00:19:01.396
So the only nutty thing
in my kitchen is my pecan pie.

00:19:01.496 --> 00:19:02.998
What a relief!

00:19:03.098 --> 00:19:06.668
I'm so happy that you don't
have to hide from me anymore.

00:19:06.801 --> 00:19:08.336
Yeah, we can be friends,

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:10.205
and I can help you out
in the kitchen.

00:19:10.305 --> 00:19:11.640
You're such a dear.

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:14.876
I'm sure your mother
misses you terribly.

00:19:16.311 --> 00:19:17.879
Please don't worry.

00:19:17.979 --> 00:19:20.982
Sonic and my friends will find
a way to get us all back home,

00:19:21.082 --> 00:19:23.885
and you can take care
of me till then.

00:19:23.985 --> 00:19:25.420
I will, Cream.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.389
I will.

00:19:27.489 --> 00:19:28.990
Thank you, Ella.

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:29.991
Chao!

00:19:30.091 --> 00:19:31.693
Now that Ella knows we're here,

00:19:31.793 --> 00:19:33.662
we can have the run
of this place.

00:19:33.795 --> 00:19:35.230
Sure.

00:19:36.598 --> 00:19:38.800
Huh? Chris?

00:19:39.467 --> 00:19:41.036
Huh?

00:19:44.005 --> 00:19:45.407
What's wrong?

00:19:45.507 --> 00:19:46.908
Why are you sad?

00:19:47.008 --> 00:19:48.143
I didn't mean it

00:19:48.243 --> 00:19:50.845
when I complained about my mom
missing the party,

00:19:50.945 --> 00:19:53.114
but Cream got really angry.

00:19:53.214 --> 00:19:56.751
I didn't even think about
how bad she misses her mother.

00:19:56.851 --> 00:19:59.921
I just hope she doesn't
stay mad at me.

00:20:00.021 --> 00:20:01.189
Don't worry.

00:20:01.289 --> 00:20:02.223
It'll be okay.

00:20:02.324 --> 00:20:03.925
[Cream humming]

00:20:04.025 --> 00:20:05.527
Hello, Chris.

00:20:05.593 --> 00:20:07.662
I made this specially for you.

00:20:07.796 --> 00:20:09.030
Do you want to put it on?

00:20:09.164 --> 00:20:10.398
Sure.

00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:12.267
Wow, thank you.

00:20:12.367 --> 00:20:13.501
You can wear it to school

00:20:13.635 --> 00:20:15.937
and tell all your friends
that I made it for you.

00:20:16.037 --> 00:20:19.107
Now I'm gonna go give
Ella her flowers.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.009
Way to go, buddy.

00:20:21.109 --> 00:20:23.211
Cream will only give
her flower crowns

00:20:23.311 --> 00:20:25.680
to the people
who she really likes a lot.

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:26.681
Like you.

00:20:26.781 --> 00:20:27.682
Really?

00:20:27.782 --> 00:20:29.150
You think she likes me?

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:31.486
You bet!

00:20:33.054 --> 00:20:34.422
