WEBVTT

00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:13.413
This place is amazing!

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:15.782
All the wildlife here
really is wild.

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:18.384
Let's land
and take a closer look.

00:00:18.484 --> 00:00:19.886
Mm-hmm.

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:20.887
Aah!

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:24.257
Tails, check the radar!
Mayday!

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:32.332
We caught them by surprise.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:34.801
Quick, fire now!

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:36.202
- Roger.
- Roger.

00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:53.419
Ha!
Time for some fun.

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.421
What are you gonna do, Sonic?

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:57.957
Ha!
You'll see.

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:10.904
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:12.438
Quick, fire!

00:01:12.538 --> 00:01:14.040
Too late!

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:19.646
Oh, no!

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.648
BOTH:
We are going to crash!

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:23.650
All right!

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:30.456
Uh-oh!

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:36.329
- The wing!
- Look out!

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:40.633
Go, go, go, go, go

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.135
Gotta go fast

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:44.304
Gotta go fast

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:47.373
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:52.445
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:54.247
Got ourselves a situation

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:56.549
Stuck in a new location

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.086
Without any explanation

00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:02.221
No talk of relaxation

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:03.856
Don't, don't, don't

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:05.625
Don't blink, don't think

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:07.460
Just go, go, go, go

00:02:07.593 --> 00:02:08.928
Go, go

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:14.467
Sonic is on the run

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:16.369
Sonic, he's number one

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.139
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.641
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:23.643
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:26.212
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:28.114
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:30.483
Sonic X

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:33.319
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:35.355
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:37.256
Sonic X

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.800
[Ratchet clicking]

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.668
[Sighs]

00:02:52.403 --> 00:02:55.306
[Grunts]
I fixed it.

00:02:55.406 --> 00:02:58.309
But, Tails,
the wing is still broken.

00:02:58.409 --> 00:02:59.010
You're right.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.813
This machine can't fly.

00:03:01.913 --> 00:03:03.314
So we'll walk.

00:03:03.414 --> 00:03:05.049
[Beeping]

00:03:09.921 --> 00:03:13.358
I forgot the X Tornado can walk!

00:03:13.458 --> 00:03:15.760
Whoa!

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.264
[Coughs]
Still needs work.

00:03:19.364 --> 00:03:21.132
[Laughs]

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:26.671
Can't I do something to help?

00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:29.707
No, thanks.
I can handle this myself.

00:03:29.807 --> 00:03:32.343
Oh, hmm.

00:03:34.812 --> 00:03:38.216
It sure is quiet around here.

00:03:41.286 --> 00:03:42.353
[Beeping]

00:03:42.453 --> 00:03:45.590
I don't even have
any phone service here.

00:03:47.825 --> 00:03:49.160
[Sighing]

00:04:02.173 --> 00:04:04.842
You can take a nap
if you want, Chris.

00:04:04.942 --> 00:04:07.879
It's gonna take some time
to do these repairs.

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:08.813
Okay.

00:04:08.913 --> 00:04:10.348
I'll wake you when I'm done.

00:04:10.448 --> 00:04:12.216
Oh, thanks.

00:04:12.317 --> 00:04:14.552
You know, Tails, there's
something about this place

00:04:14.652 --> 00:04:16.354
that's really different
from home.

00:04:16.454 --> 00:04:17.555
Really?

00:04:17.655 --> 00:04:18.589
Yeah.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.592
Time seems to move slower here
than in the city.

00:04:21.726 --> 00:04:23.361
Don't you feel it's different?

00:04:23.461 --> 00:04:24.362
No.

00:04:24.495 --> 00:04:26.764
This place feels familiar
in a certain way.

00:04:26.864 --> 00:04:28.366
It's like being back home.

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:30.868
You must really miss it there.

00:04:30.968 --> 00:04:32.837
I missed it really bad at first,

00:04:32.937 --> 00:04:35.139
but now I also like
Station Square.

00:04:35.239 --> 00:04:37.742
Someday I want to start
an engineering company there

00:04:37.842 --> 00:04:39.377
and build lots of machines.

00:04:39.477 --> 00:04:40.978
That's cool!

00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:42.814
When it comes
to building machines,

00:04:42.914 --> 00:04:44.649
you're the best there is, Tails.

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:45.550
Thanks.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.386
So, what do you think you
want to do when you're older?

00:04:48.486 --> 00:04:53.458
Well, I really want to study
zoology, I think.

00:04:53.558 --> 00:04:56.194
Grandpa and my dad want me
to like building machines,

00:04:56.327 --> 00:04:57.395
just like they do.

00:04:57.528 --> 00:04:59.330
But since I met you guys,
I figured out

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.400
I'm more interested in animals
than machines.

00:05:02.533 --> 00:05:05.536
I don't mean that you guys
are just animals, you know.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.305
Great, I'm done!

00:05:07.405 --> 00:05:10.508
And this time I'm sure
it really is fixed, Chris.

00:05:10.608 --> 00:05:13.311
Let's go and look for Sonic.

00:05:13.411 --> 00:05:14.178
Right.

00:05:24.288 --> 00:05:26.090
[Coughing]

00:05:27.725 --> 00:05:29.961
Blast that hedgehog!

00:05:30.061 --> 00:05:31.696
Huh?

00:05:32.997 --> 00:05:33.965
[Roars]

00:05:46.911 --> 00:05:48.646
[Grunting]

00:05:50.281 --> 00:05:53.451
Ohh!
E-65 is going ape!

00:05:53.551 --> 00:05:56.287
Stop monkeying around.
We have a mission to complete.

00:05:56.387 --> 00:05:59.223
[Grunting]

00:05:59.357 --> 00:06:00.558
Time to go.

00:06:00.658 --> 00:06:04.295
Dr. Eggman, we will
contact you when we find Sonic.

00:06:04.429 --> 00:06:06.564
Don't fail me!

00:06:06.664 --> 00:06:10.835
Yes, Doctor.
Take off, E-65!

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:19.377
Ha!

00:06:19.477 --> 00:06:23.748
I love it here 'cause there's
plenty of room to run around!

00:06:29.921 --> 00:06:32.023
Tails and Chris must have
landed the X Tornado

00:06:32.156 --> 00:06:33.458
somewhere around here.

00:06:33.558 --> 00:06:34.325
Huh?

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:36.861
Well, you're pretty fast
for a kitty cat.

00:06:36.961 --> 00:06:38.362
[Growls]

00:06:40.198 --> 00:06:42.567
So, you want to race, huh?

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:46.637
Well, you are pretty speedy

00:06:46.771 --> 00:06:50.041
compared to the other animals
on this slow-pokey planet.

00:06:50.141 --> 00:06:52.977
But on the raceway,
I'm a real tiger.

00:06:53.077 --> 00:06:54.545
See?

00:07:01.652 --> 00:07:03.120
[Laughs]

00:07:18.836 --> 00:07:21.205
I wonder
what they're building here.

00:07:21.305 --> 00:07:23.074
Isn't this a nature preserve?

00:07:23.174 --> 00:07:25.576
MAN: [Foreign accent]
Get it moving there!

00:07:25.676 --> 00:07:28.713
[Foreign accent] Hurry!
We have deadline to meet with!

00:07:28.813 --> 00:07:32.650
Boris, we need to get this done
quick and get out of here.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.186
Sir, could you tell us
what you're building?

00:07:35.286 --> 00:07:37.588
Huh?
How did you get here?

00:07:37.688 --> 00:07:40.157
This is restricted area.
It's dangerous.

00:07:40.258 --> 00:07:42.226
Can't you see
we are building a dam?

00:07:42.326 --> 00:07:43.661
A dam?!

00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:45.229
What's a dam?

00:07:45.329 --> 00:07:47.798
It's something you build
when you want to hold back

00:07:47.899 --> 00:07:49.934
the water
from a river or a lake.

00:07:50.034 --> 00:07:55.172
But, Chris, I don't see
any water around here.

00:07:55.273 --> 00:07:58.309
Yeah. How come you're
building a dam here, sir?

00:07:58.409 --> 00:08:00.945
You are being like that elephant
over there.

00:08:01.045 --> 00:08:02.413
Too nosy.

00:08:02.513 --> 00:08:06.150
Is none of your business
what we are doing.

00:08:07.518 --> 00:08:08.986
But have you guys thought about

00:08:09.086 --> 00:08:10.988
what will happen
to the wildlife around here

00:08:11.088 --> 00:08:13.424
after you're done
building this thing?

00:08:13.558 --> 00:08:15.259
Who cares about wildlifes?

00:08:15.359 --> 00:08:19.096
Ivan, come here and introduce
yourself to these pests.

00:08:20.698 --> 00:08:23.234
[Laughs evilly]

00:08:23.334 --> 00:08:26.737
Now go get lost, or I'll
send Ivan here to find you.

00:08:26.837 --> 00:08:28.673
Let's go.

00:08:28.773 --> 00:08:30.875
Listen up, you losers!

00:08:30.975 --> 00:08:32.643
You're just a bunch a wimps!

00:08:32.743 --> 00:08:35.379
You deserve to lose your home!

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.115
You okay?

00:08:38.215 --> 00:08:39.884
Hmm.

00:08:40.851 --> 00:08:41.786
Sorry.

00:08:41.886 --> 00:08:46.157
It's just,
back in the world I came from...

00:08:46.257 --> 00:08:47.658
No, please don't!

00:08:47.758 --> 00:08:49.160
Leave it alone, you guys!

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.729
No, keep away!

00:08:54.432 --> 00:08:57.201
[Sniffling]

00:08:57.301 --> 00:08:58.269
Huh?

00:08:59.337 --> 00:09:01.105
Hmm?

00:09:03.207 --> 00:09:04.742
[Sniffs]

00:09:07.812 --> 00:09:10.214
Whoa!
That guy is cool.

00:09:10.314 --> 00:09:12.950
I wonder where he's going.

00:09:23.327 --> 00:09:25.796
Wow! This plane looks
pretty fast,

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:29.333
but I bet I can make it
even faster!

00:09:37.041 --> 00:09:39.410
SONIC:
What do you think you're doing?

00:09:42.647 --> 00:09:43.781
[Laughs]

00:09:43.881 --> 00:09:47.184
Sorry, but when I see a machine,
I can't help myself.

00:09:47.284 --> 00:09:50.187
I hope you don't mind I changed
the engine to make it faster.

00:09:50.287 --> 00:09:53.190
Hmm, I like what you did
with the color, too.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:56.727
[Laughs]
Come and see what else I did.

00:09:56.827 --> 00:09:59.797
So, you've been
following me around all morning

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:00.998
to check out my airplane,

00:10:01.132 --> 00:10:03.134
or is there something else
you want?

00:10:03.234 --> 00:10:07.371
Well, you see, I like to build
and repair stuff,

00:10:07.471 --> 00:10:10.007
so they all make fun of me.

00:10:10.107 --> 00:10:12.109
You looked cool,
so I followed you.

00:10:12.209 --> 00:10:13.544
And when I found your plane,

00:10:13.644 --> 00:10:16.380
I figured I'd fix it up,
and we could be friends.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.815
If you want to.

00:10:17.915 --> 00:10:19.817
Well, what's your name, pal?

00:10:19.917 --> 00:10:21.886
Miles Prower.

00:10:21.986 --> 00:10:24.055
But my friends call me "Tails."

00:10:24.155 --> 00:10:25.456
My name's Sonic.

00:10:25.556 --> 00:10:27.058
Nice job, Tails.

00:10:27.158 --> 00:10:30.061
I could use a mechanic
and a friend.

00:10:30.161 --> 00:10:31.328
You mean that?

00:10:31.462 --> 00:10:34.432
Ha!
You bet!

00:10:36.167 --> 00:10:38.636
Everybody picked on me.

00:10:45.276 --> 00:10:47.611
If somebody doesn't stop
these bullies,

00:10:47.712 --> 00:10:48.679
they'll wreck this place.

00:10:48.779 --> 00:10:51.549
And I won't let that happen.

00:10:56.187 --> 00:10:59.056
You two take your bulldozers
and get out!

00:10:59.156 --> 00:11:02.960
This little furball is really
starting to get on my nerves.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.061
[Growls]

00:11:04.161 --> 00:11:07.598
If you don't stop, those
animals will lose their home!

00:11:07.698 --> 00:11:10.067
You better close
this construction site now,

00:11:10.167 --> 00:11:13.037
or I'll close it myself!

00:11:15.995 --> 00:11:17.163
Aah!

00:11:17.263 --> 00:11:18.965
Uh-oh.

00:11:22.502 --> 00:11:27.040
Next time you bother with us,
we dig hole and drop you in.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.274
- Uh!
- Uh!

00:11:28.374 --> 00:11:30.843
You know, Tails,
we're gonna need some help

00:11:30.943 --> 00:11:32.512
to stop this dam
from getting built.

00:11:32.645 --> 00:11:34.614
But who?

00:11:39.218 --> 00:11:41.087
Okay!

00:11:41.187 --> 00:11:45.024
Listen up, everybody,
we have to work together!

00:11:45.124 --> 00:11:47.660
We have to fight
to protect the nature preserve

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.128
and stop that dam!

00:11:49.228 --> 00:11:51.664
MAN: I can't believe it.
I love the preserve.

00:11:51.764 --> 00:11:53.633
We must do something
to stop them!

00:11:53.733 --> 00:11:56.302
[Indistinct shouting]

00:11:56.402 --> 00:11:58.805
You won't get away with this,
you creeps!

00:11:58.905 --> 00:12:02.241
But we build this dam
to generate power for your homes

00:12:02.341 --> 00:12:04.977
to run blenders
and other electric devices.

00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:07.713
There isn't
even enough water here!

00:12:07.847 --> 00:12:10.450
<i>Da,</i> okay.
[Laughs nervously]

00:12:10.583 --> 00:12:11.250
Huh?

00:12:15.188 --> 00:12:18.057
So those two brought
this mob here!

00:12:18.157 --> 00:12:19.625
This is restricted area.

00:12:19.725 --> 00:12:22.795
You must all leave here at once!

00:12:23.329 --> 00:12:26.065
You go home!
We're staying here!

00:12:27.867 --> 00:12:29.469
- Okay!
- Yeah!

00:12:29.569 --> 00:12:30.636
[Laughter]

00:12:33.773 --> 00:12:35.641
Have no fear, Boris.

00:12:35.741 --> 00:12:39.145
The dam will be finished,
and we will be rich.

00:12:39.245 --> 00:12:42.381
But without water here,
how can dam make power?

00:12:42.515 --> 00:12:45.952
Is dry now, but pouring
this gas on plants

00:12:46.085 --> 00:12:49.422
and setting it on fire
will cause a natural disaster.

00:12:49.522 --> 00:12:52.692
When plants burn up, rainwater
will have nowhere to flow.

00:12:52.792 --> 00:12:54.494
Soon whole land will flood,

00:12:54.594 --> 00:12:56.696
and people will beg us
to finish dam.

00:12:56.796 --> 00:12:58.931
And we will make them to pay.

00:12:59.031 --> 00:13:02.201
- Sergei, I am loving this plan.
- [Footsteps]

00:13:02.301 --> 00:13:04.103
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

00:13:04.203 --> 00:13:04.937
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:13:08.641 --> 00:13:09.942
Aah!

00:13:10.042 --> 00:13:11.310
A monkey monster!

00:13:11.444 --> 00:13:13.646
We have intruded its territory.

00:13:13.746 --> 00:13:15.448
We're sorry!

00:13:15.581 --> 00:13:17.183
Huh?

00:13:17.316 --> 00:13:19.118
They are not Sonic.

00:13:19.218 --> 00:13:20.953
Neither of them bears
a resemblance

00:13:21.053 --> 00:13:23.789
to a blue hedgehog like that.

00:13:23.856 --> 00:13:25.424
You see?

00:13:26.292 --> 00:13:28.761
But that really is Sonic!

00:13:28.861 --> 00:13:31.864
Move it, E-65!
Go catch Sonic now!

00:13:31.964 --> 00:13:33.799
[Grunting]

00:13:35.468 --> 00:13:38.070
Pound on Sonic, not us!

00:13:38.171 --> 00:13:40.439
That's enough!

00:13:44.377 --> 00:13:46.646
Want to challenge me, chimp?

00:13:52.552 --> 00:13:56.289
Hey, you artificial ape,
I'm right here!

00:14:07.533 --> 00:14:10.403
Sergei, please,
let's forget the dam.

00:14:10.503 --> 00:14:11.671
No way.

00:14:11.771 --> 00:14:13.506
Grab the gasoline cans.

00:14:13.606 --> 00:14:14.574
Okay.

00:14:14.674 --> 00:14:16.542
[Panting]

00:14:23.616 --> 00:14:26.018
Ha!
Lost it.

00:14:26.118 --> 00:14:28.588
That big ape
moves more like a slug.

00:14:28.721 --> 00:14:29.755
Huh?

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.829
That big slug just slugged me!

00:14:36.929 --> 00:14:38.364
Huh?

00:14:45.938 --> 00:14:48.040
You will pour gas on trees.

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.575
I light fire.

00:14:49.675 --> 00:14:51.377
Yes, Sergei.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:53.179
I beg your pardon.

00:14:53.312 --> 00:14:54.714
Huh?

00:14:54.814 --> 00:14:58.684
Did either of you gents
see a blue hedgehog run by here?

00:14:58.784 --> 00:15:00.720
Another crazy weirdo.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.121
[Growls]

00:15:02.221 --> 00:15:04.624
So I'm a crazy weirdo, am I?

00:15:04.724 --> 00:15:07.793
Well, I have news for you,
Mr. Big Shot.

00:15:07.893 --> 00:15:10.363
I'm going to cut you
down to size!

00:15:10.463 --> 00:15:11.564
Aah!

00:15:14.634 --> 00:15:15.968
- Aah!
- Aah!

00:15:16.068 --> 00:15:18.204
- Forget dam!
- We go home now!

00:15:18.304 --> 00:15:19.805
[Laughs evilly]

00:15:19.905 --> 00:15:22.108
That's right, keep running.

00:15:22.241 --> 00:15:24.710
You're just like
that lily-livered Sonic.

00:15:24.844 --> 00:15:28.381
Ha!
Speak of the daredevil!

00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:33.019
Eggman built this robot
with camouflage ability.

00:15:33.119 --> 00:15:36.522
How can I defeat something
I can't even see?

00:15:40.326 --> 00:15:42.194
[Groans]

00:15:42.295 --> 00:15:44.196
[Eggman laughing]

00:15:47.166 --> 00:15:48.567
You've met your match!

Eggman!

00:15:49.568 --> 00:15:52.605
E-65 strikes without warning.

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:00.746
[Laughs evilly]

00:16:00.846 --> 00:16:04.030
E-65 will make a monkey
out of Sonic!

00:16:06.428 --> 00:16:08.997
Where's that robot?!

00:16:09.598 --> 00:16:10.932
[Sighs]

00:16:13.969 --> 00:16:17.472
I can't see that thing,
so I'll have to hear it.

00:16:24.713 --> 00:16:26.915
Aah!
Ugh!

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.622
Ha!

00:16:33.722 --> 00:16:36.124
Get back here, Sonic!
You coward!

00:16:36.224 --> 00:16:38.627
Nope!
Come and get me, Eggman!

00:16:38.727 --> 00:16:42.230
Don't just lie there.
Follow that hedgehog!

00:16:48.336 --> 00:16:49.938
Huh?

00:16:50.038 --> 00:16:50.739
Huh?

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.975
Let us alone!

00:16:54.075 --> 00:16:55.443
Ha ha!

00:16:58.246 --> 00:17:00.215
TAILS:
Now that everything's okay here,

00:17:00.315 --> 00:17:02.117
Chris and I are gonna go
back home.

00:17:02.217 --> 00:17:05.620
CHRIS: We're really glad that
your preserve is safe again.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.323
Let's go look for Sonic now.

00:17:08.423 --> 00:17:10.358
Hmm!

00:17:13.395 --> 00:17:14.796
Sonic!

00:17:14.896 --> 00:17:16.231
Hey!

00:17:16.331 --> 00:17:18.233
Hi!

00:17:19.734 --> 00:17:21.836
What have you guys
been up to today?

00:17:21.937 --> 00:17:24.973
We stopped these guys
from building a huge dam

00:17:25.073 --> 00:17:27.576
and saved a nature preserve!

00:17:27.676 --> 00:17:30.078
There's Sonic!
Hurry!

00:17:30.178 --> 00:17:32.247
Oh, no!
What do we do now?!

00:17:32.347 --> 00:17:35.517
I can take care of this.
[Grunts]

00:17:35.617 --> 00:17:38.320
Get him now!

00:17:38.453 --> 00:17:39.721
Ha!

00:17:43.325 --> 00:17:45.427
- Oops!
- Huh?

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.964
Huh, I think I just
spotted its weak spot.

00:17:49.064 --> 00:17:50.465
Oh, no!

00:17:50.565 --> 00:17:52.567
E-65 camouflages itself

00:17:52.667 --> 00:17:54.269
when you see it
next to plants and rocks

00:17:54.369 --> 00:17:57.439
but not when
it's up against metal!

00:18:03.011 --> 00:18:06.014
I must get rid
of everything metal.

00:18:11.686 --> 00:18:13.154
[Laughs evilly]

00:18:13.288 --> 00:18:17.325
Soon E-65 will be able to
turn invisible again.

00:18:18.627 --> 00:18:19.461
- Huh?!
- Huh?!

00:18:19.561 --> 00:18:22.464
There won't be a scrap of metal
left here!

00:18:22.564 --> 00:18:26.901
We got no dam, no equipment,
no nothing.

00:18:29.037 --> 00:18:30.872
[Grunting]

00:18:30.972 --> 00:18:32.974
Sonic is whomping us big-time!

00:18:33.074 --> 00:18:35.844
We better get out of here quick!

00:18:41.016 --> 00:18:44.085
This gorilla is a goner!

00:18:44.219 --> 00:18:45.620
Sonic!

00:18:50.492 --> 00:18:53.395
Let's end this now.

00:18:53.995 --> 00:18:56.398
[Growls]

00:19:00.535 --> 00:19:02.771
Bye-bye!

00:19:12.614 --> 00:19:14.449
- Go, Sonic!
- Go, Sonic!

00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:15.684
Ha!

00:19:18.219 --> 00:19:21.823
Okay, Sonic.
Now it's just you and me.

00:19:21.956 --> 00:19:24.359
Ready when you are, Eggman!

00:19:24.459 --> 00:19:25.660
Ready.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:26.561
Me too!

00:19:26.661 --> 00:19:28.129
[Metallic crash]

00:19:28.229 --> 00:19:29.564
Aah!

00:19:32.634 --> 00:19:34.636
I'll be back!

00:19:37.305 --> 00:19:39.441
[Laughter]

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:45.380
I have a message for you.
Here.

00:19:45.513 --> 00:19:48.616
It's from Dr. Eggman, of course.

00:19:48.717 --> 00:19:52.420
You think you've defeated me,
but I'm still in command here.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.621
Hmm.

00:19:53.755 --> 00:19:57.058
And to prove it,
I'm going to have Bokkun here

00:19:57.158 --> 00:19:58.893
perform a little tap dance!

00:19:58.993 --> 00:20:00.195
Ohh!

00:20:01.129 --> 00:20:02.731
[Whimpering]

00:20:07.502 --> 00:20:10.438
Oh!
How embarrassing!

00:20:10.538 --> 00:20:12.040
[Crying]

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.278
[Siren wails]

00:20:24.519 --> 00:20:26.121
You stopped those creeps.

00:20:26.254 --> 00:20:27.222
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

00:20:27.355 --> 00:20:29.023
But Eggman helped.

00:20:29.157 --> 00:20:30.825
If he hadn't made us crash,

00:20:30.959 --> 00:20:33.161
we never would have been here
to save the animals.

00:20:33.261 --> 00:20:34.329
You're right!

00:20:34.429 --> 00:20:35.663

Ha ha!
