WEBVTT

00:00:04.438 --> 00:00:06.740
Things were in
pretty bad shape.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.042
We'd been stranded
in this weird world

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:10.777
for what felt like forever.

00:00:10.878 --> 00:00:13.313
And no matter how many times
we beat Eggman,

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:16.316
we still weren't any closer
to getting back home.

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:18.385
I was starting to lose hope.

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:21.221
But all that changed
about two months ago

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:23.624
when I first met Hawk.

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:25.225
I'd been traveling for a while

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:27.227
through the south side
of the continent,

00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:29.196
searching for a Chaos Emerald.

00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:32.633
I saw an old stone temple
of some kind,

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.502
and I decided to check it out.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.974
Everything was eerie and
quiet until I heard a voice.

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:44.678
HAWK:
Please! Somebody help!

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:10.070
I didn't know it then,

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.308
but Hawk and I were looking
for the same thing.

00:01:15.576 --> 00:01:18.178
I heard from Hawk again
a few weeks later.

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:20.614
He told me he found
what I was looking for.

00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:24.051
Naturally, I was
suspicious and curious,

00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:27.421
so I decided to pay
my new friend a visit.

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:30.390
Hey, how do I get to
Jack's Place from here?

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.025
Ah, I know.

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.161
You're that Sonic guy,
aren't you?

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:36.563
[Grunts]
You must be crazy!

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:38.599
I don't look anything
like Sonic!

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:39.533
I'm Knuckles!

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:41.535
I didn't mean to offend you,
pal.

00:01:41.635 --> 00:01:44.471
We don't see many hedgehogs
around here.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.875
He led me through
a half-dozen dirty alleys

00:01:48.976 --> 00:01:51.411
right to Jack's Place.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.731
Huh?

00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:14.401
I'm looking for a guy
by the name of Hawk.

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:17.504
It's not polite to stare, pal.

00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:20.874
Sorry. I don't see many folks
like you around here.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.042
Never mind that.

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:24.044
Have you seen Hawk
or haven't you?

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:27.381
Nope.
Name doesn't sound familiar.

00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:29.683
Sorry.
Wish I could help you.

00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:31.385
You're lying.

00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:32.519
MAN:
Hey!

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.355
The man told you
he hasn't seen your friend.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.257
You can either
thank him and get out,

00:02:37.391 --> 00:02:40.293
or me and my friends here
will show you the way out.

00:02:40.394 --> 00:02:44.398
Well, maybe you and your friends
are the ones who need to leave.

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:45.999
Oh, is that so?

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.968
Well, I'll show you,
you dirty little...

00:02:48.068 --> 00:02:49.536
Aah!

00:02:52.072 --> 00:02:54.074
LI YAN:
I would not do that.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.247
I have a feeling
he's tougher than he looks.

00:03:01.815 --> 00:03:03.884
Mr. Li Yan.

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:08.722
What is your business?

00:03:08.822 --> 00:03:11.425
A guy named Hawk said
I could find him here.

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:13.326
He has something I want.

00:03:13.427 --> 00:03:16.430
You must be Knuckles.
I've been expecting you.

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:19.933
If you are looking for Hawk, you
are talking to the right guy.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:22.903
Just follow me,
and I'll take you right to him.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.173
Then lead the way.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.884
Knuckles.

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:40.387
I was not expecting
to see him here.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.956
We must report this
to Dr. Eggman!

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:44.691
Go, go, go, go, go

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:46.326
Gotta go fast

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.428
Gotta go fast

00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:51.498
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:56.536
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:03:56.636 --> 00:03:58.338
Got ourselves a situation

00:03:58.438 --> 00:04:00.640
Stuck in a new location

00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:04.177
Without any explanation

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:06.313
No talk of relaxation

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:07.948
Don't, don't, don't

00:04:08.048 --> 00:04:09.716
Don't blink, don't think

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:11.551
Just go, go, go, go

00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:13.019
Go, go

00:04:16.857 --> 00:04:18.558
Sonic is on the run

00:04:18.692 --> 00:04:20.494
Sonic, he's number one

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:24.231
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:25.732
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:27.701
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:04:27.801 --> 00:04:30.270
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.172
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:34.541
Sonic X

00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:37.377
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:39.412
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:04:39.513 --> 00:04:41.314
Sonic X

00:04:59.886 --> 00:05:01.288
After you.

00:05:01.454 --> 00:05:02.656
[Chuckles]

00:05:02.756 --> 00:05:04.524
Okay.

00:05:05.992 --> 00:05:06.760
Huh?

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.461
Aah!

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.445
I'll share the cell with you,

00:05:25.545 --> 00:05:27.414
but don't think
I'm gonna share my food.

00:05:27.514 --> 00:05:29.983
If you want to eat,
you have to wait till tomorrow.

00:05:30.083 --> 00:05:33.220
That's no way to treat
a friend, is it?

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.388
Knuckles, it's you!

00:05:35.488 --> 00:05:37.657
Oh, it's so good to see you.

00:05:37.757 --> 00:05:39.092
How did you get down here?

00:05:39.192 --> 00:05:43.563
Well, let's just say
I decided to drop in.

00:05:47.934 --> 00:05:49.736
DR. EGGMAN: What was
that nincompoop Knuckles

00:05:49.836 --> 00:05:51.438
doing in a dive like that?

00:05:51.538 --> 00:05:54.140
He said he was looking
for someone named Hawk.

00:05:54.241 --> 00:05:56.676
It all seemed very
suspicious, Doctor.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.745
Very interesting.

00:05:58.845 --> 00:06:01.815
Perhaps it's time to put
our little plan into action.

00:06:01.948 --> 00:06:03.750
It ought to be loads of fun.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:04.951
Now, let's see.

00:06:05.051 --> 00:06:06.953
[Laughs evilly]

00:06:08.722 --> 00:06:10.890
Excellent.

00:06:11.491 --> 00:06:15.128
And you're sure it was
a Chaos Emerald you saw?

00:06:15.228 --> 00:06:19.132
It was a big red stone
about this size.

00:06:19.232 --> 00:06:21.868
It is a Chaos Emerald.

00:06:22.736 --> 00:06:24.571
That's one more.

00:06:24.671 --> 00:06:26.373
If only we had them all.

00:06:26.473 --> 00:06:29.142
I could get back home again.

00:06:29.276 --> 00:06:30.977
Angel Island.

00:06:31.111 --> 00:06:32.345
Paradise.

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:35.482
Just me guarding
the master emerald

00:06:35.615 --> 00:06:37.951
without a care in the world.

00:06:38.051 --> 00:06:41.488
Hour after hour, day after day,

00:06:41.588 --> 00:06:46.826
just watching and dreaming,
but mostly dreaming.

00:06:53.333 --> 00:06:56.803
I thought it would last forever.

00:07:00.907 --> 00:07:02.809
Even when things got tough,

00:07:02.942 --> 00:07:07.047
I always knew they would
eventually be all right.

00:07:14.954 --> 00:07:18.825
And then, out of nowhere,
it happened.

00:07:36.009 --> 00:07:38.678
You mean the reason you want
to find those Chaos Emeralds

00:07:38.812 --> 00:07:39.913
is so you can go back home?

00:07:40.046 --> 00:07:41.548
Best reason I can think of.

00:07:41.681 --> 00:07:43.149
So, that's it.

00:07:43.283 --> 00:07:45.885
I thought you wanted it
for the same reason I did.

00:07:45.985 --> 00:07:46.886
For money.

00:07:46.986 --> 00:07:48.788
It doesn't matter now, though.

00:07:48.888 --> 00:07:51.324
I assume they took the emerald
when they put you here.

00:07:51.424 --> 00:07:52.659
Don't you worry, Knuckles.

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:55.228
I was smart enough to hide it
before they came for me.

00:07:55.328 --> 00:07:57.130
I knew they'd be looking
for it, you see?

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.131
Where is it?

00:07:58.231 --> 00:07:59.999
[Laughs]

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.302
I hid it where nobody
could find it!

00:08:02.402 --> 00:08:04.170
It's in a...

00:08:06.172 --> 00:08:08.208
This place really isn't so bad.

00:08:08.341 --> 00:08:11.378
It's kind of cozy once you
get used to it, you know?

00:08:11.878 --> 00:08:13.880
Didn't think I'd like it
when I got here,

00:08:14.013 --> 00:08:16.750
but I really think
it's growing on me.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.485
Yeah, come to think of it,

00:08:18.585 --> 00:08:20.453
this could be a lot worse,
couldn't it?

00:08:20.553 --> 00:08:22.655
I mean, most places
like this are the pits,

00:08:22.756 --> 00:08:24.224
but as far as jail cells go,

00:08:24.324 --> 00:08:26.659
this one's first-class
all the way.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.461
And I'll tell you
something else.

00:08:28.561 --> 00:08:30.096
The food's not half-bad either.

00:08:30.196 --> 00:08:32.732
The baked beans they serve
are pretty good,

00:08:32.832 --> 00:08:34.300
even though the other day

00:08:34.401 --> 00:08:36.703
they were as cold as ice
and a little dry,

00:08:36.803 --> 00:08:38.438
but you didn't hear it from me.

00:08:38.538 --> 00:08:39.939
While we're on the subject,

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.342
they could change the menu
once in a while.

00:08:42.475 --> 00:08:44.144
Baked beans day in and day out.

00:08:44.277 --> 00:08:46.212
You'd think they'd never heard
of steak or chicken

00:08:46.312 --> 00:08:48.081
or even a cheeseburger
with fries.

00:08:48.181 --> 00:08:49.682
Wouldn't that be something?

00:08:49.816 --> 00:08:51.251
It sure would!

00:08:51.351 --> 00:08:52.585
Aah!

00:08:55.288 --> 00:08:56.689
Are you all right, sir?

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.792
What happened?

00:09:01.694 --> 00:09:04.464
Play games with me, will they?

00:09:12.872 --> 00:09:14.741
Taxi!

00:09:18.611 --> 00:09:20.513
Well, what are you waiting for?

00:09:20.613 --> 00:09:22.515
Start pedaling!

00:09:29.422 --> 00:09:32.158
Take a right up at this corner.

00:09:46.039 --> 00:09:47.373
Where are we?

00:09:47.474 --> 00:09:50.176
The old Factory District.

00:09:54.581 --> 00:09:57.083
Come on, let's go.

00:10:11.764 --> 00:10:13.433
- [Thud]
- Uhh!

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.411
Over here.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.249
Yeah!

00:10:42.854 --> 00:10:45.123
There she is!

00:10:46.224 --> 00:10:47.626
That's a Chaos Emerald!

00:10:47.726 --> 00:10:51.696
It's all yours, and thanks
for getting me out, pal.

00:10:51.796 --> 00:10:53.732
[Dr. Eggman laughs evilly]

00:10:53.832 --> 00:10:56.568
Well, if it isn't
my little friend Knucklehead.

00:10:56.701 --> 00:10:58.403
Hand over that Chaos Emerald.

00:10:58.537 --> 00:11:01.006
I promise to keep it
safe and sound.

00:11:01.106 --> 00:11:05.277
I'll give you something,
but it won't be this emerald.

00:11:08.914 --> 00:11:11.983
[Laughs evilly]
I'm a hologram!

00:11:12.083 --> 00:11:15.053
Knuckles, help me!

00:11:15.153 --> 00:11:16.988
Aah!

00:11:18.223 --> 00:11:19.624
It's you!

00:11:19.724 --> 00:11:22.861
Never judge by appearances,
knucklebrain.

00:11:22.961 --> 00:11:25.564
She may have seemed like
just a rickshaw driver to you,

00:11:25.697 --> 00:11:27.532
but she's so much more.

00:11:27.632 --> 00:11:33.238
Say hello to E-91,
also known as the Lady Ninja!

00:11:33.371 --> 00:11:34.839
Ninja?

00:11:34.973 --> 00:11:37.442
Yes, and quite a lovely one
at that.

00:11:37.542 --> 00:11:39.511
But don't let
her loveliness dazzle you.

00:11:39.644 --> 00:11:40.745
You might get hurt.

00:11:40.845 --> 00:11:43.815
A robot?!
Eggman!

00:11:47.452 --> 00:11:49.354
It's time, my beauty.

00:11:49.454 --> 00:11:52.891
Time for you to get me
that Chaos Emerald.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.804
Let's throw a bit more
weight behind things.

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:27.959
Quick, Hawk.
Grab the emerald and run!

00:12:39.804 --> 00:12:40.772
Let's go!

00:12:40.872 --> 00:12:43.475
Knuckles, the emerald.
It's buried!

00:12:46.778 --> 00:12:48.546
Sneaking up on a girl.

00:12:48.647 --> 00:12:51.283
That's no way to treat a lady.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.390
I don't know what that is,
but it's not good.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:59.824
What the...

00:13:00.692 --> 00:13:04.329
I think that's my cue
to get outta here.

00:13:11.002 --> 00:13:13.138
Hawk, we have to get
away from that thing!

00:13:13.271 --> 00:13:15.407
I know, but how?

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.208
Aah!

00:13:33.591 --> 00:13:35.393
Now our top story this hour.

00:13:35.493 --> 00:13:38.563
Interesting developments in
last night's building collapse.

00:13:38.697 --> 00:13:42.100
Eyewitnesses have reported
spotting Dr. Eggman in the area

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.768
around the time of the collapse.

00:13:43.902 --> 00:13:46.538
Officials have launched
a full investigation.

00:13:46.671 --> 00:13:49.240
Guess there's not much
we can do now,

00:13:49.374 --> 00:13:51.509
except maybe hang around
here for a while

00:13:51.643 --> 00:13:53.311
till the dust settles.

00:13:53.411 --> 00:13:56.981
I had that emerald
in the palm of my hand.

00:13:58.416 --> 00:13:59.818
Aah!

00:14:02.253 --> 00:14:04.189
Knock it off, Knuckles.

00:14:04.289 --> 00:14:05.623
That won't do any good.

00:14:16.201 --> 00:14:17.435
[Gasps]

00:14:19.237 --> 00:14:21.973
Is this...
The shovel claws!

00:14:22.073 --> 00:14:23.842
How'd they get here?

00:14:23.942 --> 00:14:25.443
Those metal things?

00:14:25.577 --> 00:14:27.412
I dug 'em out
of that old temple.

00:14:27.512 --> 00:14:30.248
You know, where you saved me.

00:14:42.794 --> 00:14:45.330
The shovel claws.

00:14:54.806 --> 00:14:57.075
Careful down there!

00:15:08.353 --> 00:15:11.389
I know it's around here
somewhere.

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:27.639
Hawk, where are you?!

00:15:27.739 --> 00:15:29.741
[Giggles]

00:15:29.874 --> 00:15:31.409
Pay attention, Knuckles!

00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:34.078
Special message from Dr. Eggman.

00:15:34.179 --> 00:15:36.114
DR. EGGMAN: If you want
to see your friend again,

00:15:36.214 --> 00:15:39.751
you'd best mosey on over
to New Town and make it snappy!

00:15:39.851 --> 00:15:40.785
[Laughs]

00:15:40.885 --> 00:15:42.520
And don't try anything funny.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.856
Bokkun's been studying
the martial arts.

00:15:44.956 --> 00:15:46.791
He's getting better.

00:15:46.891 --> 00:15:48.760
I know karate!

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.728
Hyah!

00:15:50.829 --> 00:15:52.297
Gotcha!

00:15:52.397 --> 00:15:53.398
Karate chop!

00:15:53.498 --> 00:15:55.266
These hands
are dangerous weapons!

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.235
Take that!
Don't mess with me!

00:15:57.368 --> 00:15:58.803
[Giggles]

00:16:12.016 --> 00:16:15.153
Knuckles, it's you!

00:16:15.687 --> 00:16:16.921
Good evening.

00:16:17.021 --> 00:16:20.158
I trust you brought
the Chaos Emerald with you.

00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:24.829
Now, give it to the little lady!

00:16:40.044 --> 00:16:41.479
Knuckles!
Aah!

00:16:47.719 --> 00:16:50.622
I want that Chaos Emerald!

00:16:50.722 --> 00:16:53.992
How about I keep the emerald,
and you get lost?

00:16:58.096 --> 00:16:59.964
Nice shot.

00:17:01.499 --> 00:17:03.167
Quick.
This way!

00:17:20.151 --> 00:17:21.553
Ohh!

00:17:32.997 --> 00:17:34.532
Think maybe
I'll pay another visit

00:17:34.632 --> 00:17:37.335
when things calm down a bit.

00:17:39.203 --> 00:17:40.772
Aah!

00:17:46.277 --> 00:17:47.478
Aah!

00:17:58.598 --> 00:18:00.233
Thank you.

00:18:02.869 --> 00:18:04.471
You're not going anywhere.

00:18:04.638 --> 00:18:07.741
Now, hand over that emerald
before there's more trouble.

00:18:22.489 --> 00:18:23.623
Aah!

00:18:33.333 --> 00:18:36.136
Stop it!
You're hurting him!

00:18:37.771 --> 00:18:39.606
Aah!

00:18:41.775 --> 00:18:42.976
Aah!

00:19:15.475 --> 00:19:18.745
Well, I know you
have to be on your way,

00:19:18.845 --> 00:19:23.216
but maybe you could come back
sometime to visit,

00:19:23.316 --> 00:19:26.419
'cause I'm gonna miss you,
Knuckles.

00:19:35.462 --> 00:19:38.398
Yes, I'll be back!
See you, Hawk!

00:19:38.498 --> 00:19:41.268
So long, my friend!

00:19:42.569 --> 00:19:44.571
Goodbye!

00:19:44.671 --> 00:19:47.474
Come back soon!

00:20:05.325 --> 00:20:07.627
Where am I?

00:20:11.298 --> 00:20:13.933
TICAL: The servers are

00:20:14.034 --> 00:20:16.736
the Seven Chaos.

00:20:17.103 --> 00:20:20.106
"The servers are
the Seven Chaos"?

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.142
What does that mean?

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:44.130
What was that all about?
