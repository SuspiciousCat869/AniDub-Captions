[Panting]

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:27.060
He's tougher than I thought.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.462
I'd better finish this.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.280
Oof!

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:51.151
[Panting]

00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:54.621
Your defeat is certain.

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:58.858
Give me the Chaos Emeralds,
and I will spare your life.

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:08.802
Chaos Control!

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:28.421
[Chuckling]

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:29.489
Oh...

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.634
Sonic has only delayed my triumph.

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:44.204
Those Emeralds will be mine.

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:47.107
Alert my forces across the galaxy.

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:50.410
Begin the search for the
Chaos Emeralds at once.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.180
Do not rest until you
bring them all to me.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.422
Remove the Planet Egg.

00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:04.557
[Evil laughter]

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:23.510
Go, go, go, go, go

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.613
Gotta go fast

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:29.549
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:35.355
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:37.424
Got ourselves a situation

00:02:37.424 --> 00:02:39.459
Stuck in a new location

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.063
Without any explanation

00:02:43.063 --> 00:02:45.131
No talk of relaxation

00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:46.766
Don't, don't, don't

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:48.535
Don't blink, don't think

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:50.336
Just go, go, go, go

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:51.838
Go, go

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:57.410
Sonic is on the run

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.312
Sonic, he's number one

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:03.016
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:06.720
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.122
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:11.024
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:13.526
Sonic X

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:15.462
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:18.264
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:19.299
Sonic X

00:03:24.855 --> 00:03:27.491
CREAM: How much longer do
we have to wait, Tails?

00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:31.028
TAILS: I'm not exactly
sure, Cream. Not too long.

00:03:31.028 --> 00:03:34.898
This would be so romantic if Sonic
were here to see it with me.

00:03:34.898 --> 00:03:38.302
Soon the whole sky will be
filled with shooting stars.

00:03:38.302 --> 00:03:41.205
According to the astronomers,
we only get a meteor shower

00:03:41.205 --> 00:03:44.408
this humongous once
every 500 years or so.

00:03:44.408 --> 00:03:45.909
We're really lucky to be here.

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.113
I sure wouldn't wanna wait that
long to see it again. Would you?

00:03:50.113 --> 00:03:50.914
Chao!

00:03:50.914 --> 00:03:52.649
We should all make a wish.

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.184
Why should we do that?

00:03:54.184 --> 00:03:57.454
Chris told us if you make a wish
whenever you see a shooting star,

00:03:57.454 --> 00:03:59.590
it'll come true. Remember, Tails?

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.557
Yeah.

00:04:00.557 --> 00:04:04.428
It's too bad Chris and Chuck
aren't here to see this with us.

00:04:04.428 --> 00:04:05.596
I miss them.

00:04:05.596 --> 00:04:08.298
I wish we could go back to
their world for a visit.

00:04:09.266 --> 00:04:10.234
Hmm.

00:04:13.203 --> 00:04:14.171
[All gasp]

00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:15.239
It's starting!

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.174
They look like fireworks!

00:04:18.542 --> 00:04:21.044
I'm sure glad I brought a camera.

00:04:23.247 --> 00:04:26.149
That sure is a weird
looking meteor.

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:29.987
If I didn't know better, I'd say
it's heading straight for us.

00:04:32.456 --> 00:04:33.357
Aah!

00:04:36.927 --> 00:04:38.262
[Loud crash]

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.309
Huh! That's no shooting star.

00:05:05.255 --> 00:05:06.490
[Moaning]

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.425
She needs help.

00:05:08.425 --> 00:05:11.328
Your house is the closest
one around here, Cream.

00:05:11.328 --> 00:05:13.030
I think we should take her there.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.198
We'll go tell Mother you're coming.

00:05:15.198 --> 00:05:16.500
Chao!

00:05:17.467 --> 00:05:21.471
I wonder who she is, and
where she came from.

00:05:28.512 --> 00:05:29.479
[Snoring]

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:30.447
Mm.

00:05:31.415 --> 00:05:33.350
[Sighing peacefully]

00:05:39.156 --> 00:05:40.257
Huh?

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:42.659
Huh?

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:43.827
DR. EGGMAN: It's about time.

00:05:43.827 --> 00:05:45.062
Huh?

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.498
Eggman! What happened?

00:05:48.498 --> 00:05:50.901
I've been sitting here for
the better part of a week

00:05:50.901 --> 00:05:53.370
waiting for you to
wake up and tell me.

00:05:54.304 --> 00:05:55.672
[Both panting]

00:05:55.672 --> 00:05:58.375
I was out jogging to maintain
my perfect physique

00:05:58.375 --> 00:06:00.210
when I spotted something.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.712
Hmm.

00:06:03.747 --> 00:06:06.016
You were in pretty
bad shape, Sonic.

00:06:06.016 --> 00:06:08.585
You were battered
like a fish stick.

00:06:10.053 --> 00:06:11.722
It was a tough decision.

00:06:11.722 --> 00:06:13.590
I didn't know whether to save you,

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.659
or wait for the tide to come in.

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:17.060
[Evil laugh]

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.662
You were in terrible shape, Sonic.

00:06:18.662 --> 00:06:20.163
Dr. Eggman saved your life!

00:06:20.163 --> 00:06:23.734
If he hadn't, he wouldn't
have anybody to pick on.

00:06:24.701 --> 00:06:27.604
So, how'd you end up passed
out on the beach anyway?

00:06:27.604 --> 00:06:29.272
I was fighting somebody.

00:06:29.272 --> 00:06:30.540
Whoa!

00:06:30.907 --> 00:06:33.910
Hey, sorry, but I
can't say any more.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.779
Whoa! Woah!

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:37.714
You're leaving?

00:06:37.714 --> 00:06:39.649
See you later, Eggman.

00:06:40.751 --> 00:06:42.652
Hey, you owe us, Sonic!

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:45.555
You run fast, but when it
comes to paying your debts,

00:06:45.555 --> 00:06:46.990
you sure are a slowpoke!

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.458
Yeah!

00:06:48.458 --> 00:06:50.994
What a deadbeat! Ugh!

00:06:51.962 --> 00:06:53.897
Sonic, you ingrate!

00:06:53.897 --> 00:06:56.166
That is the last time we help you!

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:59.369
Yeah! Patients like
you make me sick!

00:07:01.972 --> 00:07:02.973
Ah!

00:07:09.713 --> 00:07:13.417
[Whimpering]

00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:19.256
[Panting]

00:07:20.957 --> 00:07:22.225
Ah! Aah!

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:29.132
Cosmo, run away!

00:07:29.132 --> 00:07:33.069
[Whimpering]

00:07:34.971 --> 00:07:36.940
Look! She's waking up.

00:07:37.774 --> 00:07:38.775
Huh?

00:07:42.012 --> 00:07:43.580
Careful, dear.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.048
Don't try to get up.

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:46.750
You were in a big crash.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.853
You're really lucky that you
didn't have any serious injuries.

00:07:49.853 --> 00:07:51.788
Maybe you could tell us your name

00:07:51.788 --> 00:07:54.024
and where you and your
ship came here from.

00:07:54.024 --> 00:07:54.991
Huh?

00:07:56.927 --> 00:07:57.694
I can't.

00:07:57.694 --> 00:08:00.063
You mean you can't remember?

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:03.033
I can, but I can't tell you.

00:08:03.033 --> 00:08:04.267
Why?

00:08:04.267 --> 00:08:08.171
I'm looking for somebody on this
planet named Sonic the Hedgehog.

00:08:08.171 --> 00:08:11.074
It's very important that I speak
with him as soon as possible,

00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:13.009
before it's too late.

00:08:13.009 --> 00:08:14.611
You can talk to us.

00:08:14.611 --> 00:08:16.246
We'll help you if we can.

00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:17.147
What's the matter?

00:08:17.147 --> 00:08:18.515
I can't tell you.

00:08:18.515 --> 00:08:21.117
Well, I have a right to know
what this is all about!

00:08:21.117 --> 00:08:21.852
Huh?

00:08:21.852 --> 00:08:23.053
Sonic's my boyfriend,

00:08:23.053 --> 00:08:25.021
and you'd better not be
trying to move in on him!

00:08:25.021 --> 00:08:27.924
Amy, she didn't come
here to date him!

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.929
We're friends with Sonic,
so maybe we can help.

00:08:33.563 --> 00:08:34.865
Friends?

00:08:34.865 --> 00:08:36.800
My name's Miles Prower,

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.135
but everybody calls me
by my nickname, Tails.

00:08:39.135 --> 00:08:41.671
And I'm Cream. We're
very happy to meet you.

00:08:41.671 --> 00:08:43.373
And my name's Amy Rose.

00:08:43.373 --> 00:08:45.709
You're not gonna be
here long, are you?

00:08:45.709 --> 00:08:46.977
Hmm...

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:51.515
[All gasp]

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:54.551
Ah!

00:08:56.453 --> 00:08:58.388
what's that?

00:08:58.388 --> 00:09:00.123
It's something big.

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:01.424
[Whimper]

00:09:01.424 --> 00:09:03.260
You should stay in bed.

00:09:10.834 --> 00:09:12.469
It's another Metarex.

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:21.878
[Snoring]

00:09:21.878 --> 00:09:23.780
Huh?

00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:28.618
Woah.

00:09:29.019 --> 00:09:29.953
[Crashing]

00:09:40.363 --> 00:09:42.866
This looks like... trouble.

00:09:44.267 --> 00:09:47.971
Preparing area for
Planet Egg removal.

00:09:50.273 --> 00:09:53.910
[Explosions]

00:09:56.146 --> 00:09:57.847
Woah! If that thing isn't stopped,

00:09:57.847 --> 00:10:00.417
it's gonna burn up every
tree in the forest!

00:10:05.922 --> 00:10:07.924
Hey, knock it off, you fire bug!

00:10:10.226 --> 00:10:11.394
[Grunting]

00:10:11.394 --> 00:10:12.896
Woah!

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:17.534
Grr.

00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:23.273
Aah!

00:10:23.273 --> 00:10:25.241
TAILS: Knuckles!

00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:29.045
All right. Maybe we
can stop him together.

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:32.983
This doesn't look good.

00:10:37.253 --> 00:10:40.256
Looks like our only choice
is to keep pounding away.

00:10:41.758 --> 00:10:44.661
We're going on the
attack. Are you ready?

00:10:44.661 --> 00:10:45.528
Yes.

00:10:48.732 --> 00:10:51.701
[Panting]

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.643
The whole forest's on fire.

00:10:59.643 --> 00:11:01.544
This can't be a coincidence.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.017
I have a feeling that girl may
know why this is happening.

00:11:07.017 --> 00:11:10.220
I wish there was a way to
convince her to talk to us.

00:11:11.187 --> 00:11:12.155
[Gasp]

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.392
[Grunting]

00:11:15.392 --> 00:11:16.359
Gah!

00:11:19.996 --> 00:11:22.298
Our lasers had no effect.

00:11:22.298 --> 00:11:24.267
You need to use much
stronger attacks

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:26.369
if you're ever going
to beat a Metarex.

00:11:26.369 --> 00:11:28.171
Do you know why it came here?

00:11:28.171 --> 00:11:30.407
Or why it's destroying
all the trees?

00:11:30.407 --> 00:11:35.278
It's mission is to find the life-force
of this planet and steal it away.

00:11:36.246 --> 00:11:37.013
Huh?

00:11:45.422 --> 00:11:46.389
It's Sonic!

00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:47.424
Chao!

00:11:49.926 --> 00:11:51.428
He's back!

00:11:51.428 --> 00:11:52.395
[Gasp]

00:11:52.395 --> 00:11:53.563
Oh!

00:11:53.563 --> 00:11:55.832
Are you okay?

00:11:55.832 --> 00:11:57.400
Yes.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.303
So that's Sonic... our final hope.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.983
You're the one who's
going down in flames now!

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:14.951
[Chuckling]

00:12:29.369 --> 00:12:36.042
[Munching on food]

00:12:36.042 --> 00:12:37.043
Hey, I know.

00:12:37.043 --> 00:12:40.146
Maybe if I increase the energy
to the transport circuits...

00:12:43.149 --> 00:12:44.517
That's it!

00:12:44.517 --> 00:12:45.752
All right!

00:12:45.752 --> 00:12:48.021
It's finally time to try this out.

00:12:52.592 --> 00:12:54.894
My machine's like the one
Grandpa and Tails built

00:12:54.894 --> 00:12:57.030
to send Sonic and the
others back home,

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.132
but it doesn't need Chaos Emeralds.

00:12:59.132 --> 00:13:01.868
If it works, I'll finally
see Sonic again.

00:13:17.717 --> 00:13:19.285
[Glass shatters]

00:13:19.285 --> 00:13:20.253
[gasps]

00:13:23.823 --> 00:13:25.158
I'm coming.

00:13:29.963 --> 00:13:31.531
TAILS: Head's up, sonic!

00:13:33.299 --> 00:13:34.868
Thanks, Tails!

00:13:37.337 --> 00:13:38.638
[Grunting]

00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:41.741
Woah! [Grunting]

00:13:41.741 --> 00:13:44.043
Ah!

00:13:44.611 --> 00:13:45.545
Ugh! Huh!

00:13:46.746 --> 00:13:49.449
Oof! [Grunting]

00:13:49.449 --> 00:13:51.017
It's pretty tough.

00:13:51.985 --> 00:13:54.254
Yeah, but we can beat him, buddy.

00:13:55.221 --> 00:13:56.823
Got a plan?

00:13:56.823 --> 00:13:58.591
Double team. Let's go!

00:13:58.591 --> 00:13:59.959
Oh!

00:14:01.461 --> 00:14:04.964
I thought Sonic would move much
more quickly than he does.

00:14:06.466 --> 00:14:08.001
Something's not right.

00:14:08.001 --> 00:14:10.970
Sonic's not moving as
fast as he usually does.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.142
Oof.

00:14:19.946 --> 00:14:21.447
This is impossible.

00:14:21.447 --> 00:14:23.149
No matter how hard
we hit that thing,

00:14:23.149 --> 00:14:24.550
it keeps going.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:27.287
You'll have to use the Chaos
Emeralds to stop this thing.

00:14:27.287 --> 00:14:29.088
I'll distract it with
a frontal attack

00:14:29.088 --> 00:14:31.524
so you can move in
and finish it off.

00:14:31.524 --> 00:14:33.393
I'd like to, but I
don't happen to have

00:14:33.393 --> 00:14:35.461
the Chaos Emeralds
with me right now.

00:14:36.429 --> 00:14:38.197
Wh-where are they?

00:14:38.765 --> 00:14:41.668
Well, I kind of got into
this fight out in space,

00:14:41.668 --> 00:14:43.736
and the bad guy was
gonna take 'em from me,

00:14:43.736 --> 00:14:45.204
so I sent 'em away.

00:14:45.805 --> 00:14:49.075
You finally had all seven
Chaos Emeralds together,

00:14:49.075 --> 00:14:50.743
and you threw them away?!

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:52.645
Exactly.

00:14:52.645 --> 00:14:54.047
Are you crazy?!

00:14:54.047 --> 00:14:55.381
What are we gonna do?!

00:14:55.381 --> 00:14:57.717
I guess we're gonna
have to find 'em again.

00:14:59.218 --> 00:15:00.520
[Both yelling]

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.788
Oh, no!

00:15:01.788 --> 00:15:02.455
Ah!

00:15:02.455 --> 00:15:03.523
Are you okay?

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:05.358
Look out!

00:15:05.358 --> 00:15:06.192
Ah!

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.429
Ch-ch-ch-ch-chao!

00:15:10.029 --> 00:15:11.931
[Both screaming]

00:15:16.536 --> 00:15:19.839
Proceeding with
Planet Egg removal.

00:15:30.516 --> 00:15:31.484
Oh no!

00:15:38.257 --> 00:15:40.226
[All screaming]

00:16:08.287 --> 00:16:10.256
What in the world is that?

00:16:12.458 --> 00:16:14.594
He's found the Planet Egg.

00:16:14.594 --> 00:16:16.195
What's the Planet Egg?

00:16:16.195 --> 00:16:20.066
It's the life source that
sustains your world.

00:16:31.044 --> 00:16:35.214
The Planet Egg is what gives your
world the power to support life.

00:16:35.214 --> 00:16:39.085
Without it, every living
thing here will soon perish.

00:16:45.458 --> 00:16:47.360
Procedure complete.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.728
Lift-off!

00:16:53.166 --> 00:16:54.133
Hold it!

00:16:56.402 --> 00:16:57.170
Ugh!

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:58.137
I got ya.

00:16:58.137 --> 00:17:00.640
[Grunting]

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.642
[Both grunting]

00:17:09.048 --> 00:17:10.483
I'll stop that thing!

00:17:16.222 --> 00:17:17.723
[Gritting teeth]

00:17:22.695 --> 00:17:24.230
I can't go any higher,

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.233
'cause this plane wasn't
designed to travel into space.

00:17:27.233 --> 00:17:28.434
Ahh....

00:17:28.434 --> 00:17:30.269
Are you all right, Cosmo?

00:17:30.269 --> 00:17:32.638
I'm just a little dizzy.

00:17:32.638 --> 00:17:34.240
I'm sorry.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.143
I just wish I got
the Planet Egg back.

00:17:37.143 --> 00:17:39.645
Could you... open this
for a moment, please?

00:17:39.645 --> 00:17:40.446
Huh?

00:17:40.446 --> 00:17:43.116
You can open it while
you're flying, can't you?.

00:17:43.116 --> 00:17:46.986
Yeah, but I'm not sure it's a good
idea to do it at this altitude.

00:17:47.687 --> 00:17:48.921
Please, Tails.

00:17:48.921 --> 00:17:51.257
Okay. If you really want me to.

00:17:51.257 --> 00:17:52.425
[Gasping]

00:17:53.426 --> 00:17:54.727
There ya go.

00:17:54.727 --> 00:17:55.895
Oh!

00:18:10.759 --> 00:18:13.395
You didn't put up much of a
fight against that thing, Sonic.

00:18:13.395 --> 00:18:15.631
Are you sure you're feeling okay?

00:18:15.631 --> 00:18:17.867
You don't seem like your old self.

00:18:17.867 --> 00:18:21.003
It's been a long day, so I
guess I'm a little tired.

00:18:21.003 --> 00:18:23.205
Huh?

00:18:36.318 --> 00:18:37.586
My name is Cosmo.

00:18:37.586 --> 00:18:39.488
I've come a long way to see you.

00:18:39.488 --> 00:18:41.957
I need to speak with you, Sonic.

00:18:41.957 --> 00:18:43.392
Okay.

00:18:43.392 --> 00:18:45.895
I have sought you out because
I know you have the power

00:18:45.895 --> 00:18:47.796
to control the Chaos Emeralds.

00:18:47.796 --> 00:18:52.001
I have come here because you are
the one who can rescue the galaxy.

00:18:52.968 --> 00:18:54.670
I am?

00:19:00.142 --> 00:19:01.644
What's that?

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:10.553
TAILS: Guys! It's happening!

00:19:15.257 --> 00:19:16.392
[Panting]

00:19:16.392 --> 00:19:18.127
What's happening?

00:19:20.729 --> 00:19:23.365
Dear Mom, and Dad, and everybody,

00:19:23.365 --> 00:19:26.168
I'm sorry to leave
without saying goodbye.

00:19:26.168 --> 00:19:27.570
I knew if I said anything,

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:31.006
you'd try and stop me from trying
to travel to Sonic's world.

00:19:31.006 --> 00:19:33.008
It's very important to me,

00:19:33.008 --> 00:19:34.977
so I hope you'll understand.

00:19:34.977 --> 00:19:36.478
Don't worry.

00:19:36.478 --> 00:19:38.013
I'll be fine.

00:19:38.013 --> 00:19:40.349
And, I'll be back.

00:19:40.349 --> 00:19:41.684
I'll miss you all.

00:19:41.684 --> 00:19:47.122
Mom, and Dad, Grandpa, Danny,
Francis, and Helen...

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:49.091
I love you.

00:19:49.091 --> 00:19:50.259
Chris

00:19:50.259 --> 00:19:53.562
P.S. I'll tell Sonic and the
others you said "hello."

00:20:26.328 --> 00:20:28.097
[All gasping]

00:20:33.068 --> 00:20:34.837
Hey, that's Chris!

00:20:34.837 --> 00:20:36.105
It worked!

00:20:36.805 --> 00:20:38.774
I did it!

00:20:38.774 --> 00:20:40.643
I actually did it!

00:20:40.643 --> 00:20:42.578
Sonic!

00:20:43.012 --> 00:20:44.380
[Groan]

00:20:46.649 --> 00:20:47.650
Uh.

00:20:49.852 --> 00:20:51.353
Uh?

00:20:56.692 --> 00:21:00.323
Uh!!!
