[Beeping]

00:00:10.672 --> 00:00:12.340
Haha!

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.176
Looks like I've hit
the jewel jackpot!

00:00:15.176 --> 00:00:17.278
I found two Chaos Emeralds!

00:00:17.278 --> 00:00:18.680
Hmm, let me think.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.481
We already have two Emeralds,

00:00:20.481 --> 00:00:22.116
and Sonic has three more...

00:00:22.116 --> 00:00:23.718
Plus these two, equals seven.

00:00:23.718 --> 00:00:25.420
All the Chaos Emeralds
have been found!

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.888
You are brilliant, Doctor!

00:00:26.888 --> 00:00:27.989
Yes, I know.

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.258
Don't pat yourself on
your hunchback, yet.

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:34.028
Rouge, what are you doing here?

00:00:34.028 --> 00:00:36.631
Just having a little
look-see around.

00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:37.765
Geh! Hold on!

00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:40.435
Why, Doctor, have you
found some Emeralds?

00:00:40.435 --> 00:00:43.538
I hope she doesn't tell
Dr. Eggman my secret!

00:00:43.538 --> 00:00:46.941
I wasn't attempting to keep
my discovery from you.

00:00:46.941 --> 00:00:49.143
I meant to call you
up to the bridge.

00:00:49.143 --> 00:00:50.945
It's just that, in
all the excitement,

00:00:50.945 --> 00:00:54.582
I forgot that you were interested
in the Chaos Emeralds, too.

00:00:54.582 --> 00:00:57.585
You know how absent-minded
we geniuses can be.

00:00:57.585 --> 00:00:58.286
[Chuckles]

00:00:58.286 --> 00:01:00.488
So, where are they?

00:01:01.322 --> 00:01:02.924
Go, go, go, go, go

00:01:02.924 --> 00:01:06.027
Gotta go fast

00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:08.963
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:11.232 --> 00:01:14.769
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:16.838
Got ourselves a situation

00:01:16.838 --> 00:01:18.873
Stuck in a new location

00:01:18.873 --> 00:01:22.477
Without any explanation

00:01:22.477 --> 00:01:24.545
No talk of relaxation

00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:26.180
Don't, don't, don't

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.982
Don't blink, don't think

00:01:27.982 --> 00:01:29.784
Just go, go, go, go

00:01:29.784 --> 00:01:31.286
Go, go

00:01:34.956 --> 00:01:36.824
Sonic is on the run

00:01:36.824 --> 00:01:38.726
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:38.726 --> 00:01:42.430
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.134
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:01:46.134 --> 00:01:48.536
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:48.536 --> 00:01:50.438
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:01:50.438 --> 00:01:52.940
Sonic X

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.876
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.679
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:58.713
Sonic X

00:02:14.642 --> 00:02:18.479
There are two Chaos Emeralds
inside that space fortress.

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:19.981
We've got to seize them.

00:02:19.981 --> 00:02:21.182
But how, Doctor?

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:22.950
That is a Metarex base.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.753
It will have a heavy-duty
security system.

00:02:25.753 --> 00:02:27.989
How do you plan to get in there?

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.791
It's not like you can go
up and knock on the door.

00:02:30.791 --> 00:02:33.895
If they spot us,
we'll be space toast.

00:02:35.396 --> 00:02:38.299
What's the Blue Typhoon doing here?

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.968
They must've come looking
for the Chaos Emeralds.

00:02:40.968 --> 00:02:42.403
You slowpoke!

00:02:42.403 --> 00:02:44.405
Sonic's gonna beat you to them.

00:02:44.772 --> 00:02:48.109
Rouge drives me bats,
especially when she's right!

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:49.877
What'll I do?

00:02:55.616 --> 00:02:58.519
How do you know you can't
break in, unless you try?

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.955
You saw what happened
to that meteorite.

00:03:00.955 --> 00:03:02.757
It's too dangerous!

00:03:02.757 --> 00:03:06.127
Hey, guys, we need to
come up with a plan here.

00:03:06.127 --> 00:03:09.764
Don't worry about that, Sonic.
I've got it all figured out.

00:03:10.765 --> 00:03:13.201
I have a proposal for you.

00:03:14.268 --> 00:03:16.003
I've gotta hear this.

00:03:16.003 --> 00:03:19.140
Why don't we join our
forces and work together?

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.374
What's that?

00:03:20.374 --> 00:03:21.342
I see.

00:03:21.342 --> 00:03:24.345
You're planning to double-cross
them, aren't you?

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.647
We shouldn't work with Eggman.

00:03:26.647 --> 00:03:28.216
He's trying to trick us.

00:03:28.216 --> 00:03:29.183
Chao chao!

00:03:29.183 --> 00:03:31.852
Yeah, don't even think
about it, Knuckles.

00:03:31.852 --> 00:03:33.955
I didn't say anything!

00:03:34.355 --> 00:03:36.557
I think we should work with Eggman.

00:03:36.557 --> 00:03:38.459
Our chances are better that way.

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:39.527
I agree.

00:03:39.527 --> 00:03:41.395
[All mumble in agreement]

00:03:41.395 --> 00:03:44.198
All right. Let's go for it, Eggman.

00:03:44.198 --> 00:03:47.001
So, how're we gonna
get in the base?

00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:49.103
We can sneak in without
getting caught

00:03:49.103 --> 00:03:50.871
by using Chaos Control.

00:03:52.006 --> 00:03:54.408
Of course! How brilliant.

00:03:54.408 --> 00:03:57.211
This is your most ingenious
plan ever, Doctor.

00:03:57.211 --> 00:03:58.746
This plan is the pits.

00:03:58.746 --> 00:04:00.681
Why do we need Sonic's
help for this scheme?

00:04:00.681 --> 00:04:02.216
We have Shadow on our side.

00:04:02.216 --> 00:04:03.184
Our side?

00:04:03.184 --> 00:04:04.685
Don't make me laugh.

00:04:04.685 --> 00:04:08.389
If you ever get a hold of those
Emeralds, you'll skip ship in a flash.

00:04:08.823 --> 00:04:10.057
Here's what we'll do.

00:04:10.057 --> 00:04:12.126
The first group in will
head to the computer

00:04:12.126 --> 00:04:13.894
that controls the security system.

00:04:13.894 --> 00:04:15.896
They're responsible
for shutting it down.

00:04:15.896 --> 00:04:18.899
Then the rest of us can sneak
into the base undetected.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:20.401
Sounds cool!

00:04:20.401 --> 00:04:22.770
What'll we do when we find
the Emeralds, though?

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.239
Will we share them 50/50?

00:04:25.239 --> 00:04:27.608
Whoever gets to them
first can keep them.

00:04:27.608 --> 00:04:28.342
Huh.

00:04:28.342 --> 00:04:29.644
It's a deal!

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:31.312
To make sure it's a fair contest,

00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:34.215
both sides will supply
members for the entry team.

00:04:34.215 --> 00:04:36.884
I've selected Shadow and
Rouge to represent our side.

00:04:36.884 --> 00:04:38.886
Wait, why should I go?

00:04:38.886 --> 00:04:42.456
Because, when it comes to
break-ins, you're a real smash.

00:04:42.456 --> 00:04:45.259
You're not afraid to
go in there, are you?

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.128
Of course I'm not afraid!

00:04:47.128 --> 00:04:48.262
Ugh.

00:04:48.262 --> 00:04:49.797
He's putting me on the entry team,

00:04:49.797 --> 00:04:51.999
because then I can't get
to the Emeralds first,

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:53.567
or so he thinks.

00:04:53.567 --> 00:04:55.603
I'd be thrilled to join the team!

00:04:55.603 --> 00:04:58.339
I knew I could count on you, Rouge.

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:59.473
Thank you!

00:05:04.578 --> 00:05:06.180
Count me out!

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.716
I refuse to join any team
with Shadow and Rouge,

00:05:08.716 --> 00:05:09.850
because I don't like them.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.120
It's not like you're going
on a picnic with them, Amy.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.989
I'm not goin', either.

00:05:14.989 --> 00:05:18.125
I won't work with that
burglaring bat anymore.

00:05:18.125 --> 00:05:20.594
Maybe we should pick
a name out of a hat.

00:05:22.596 --> 00:05:23.864
I volunteer.

00:05:23.864 --> 00:05:25.232
Are you sure?

00:05:25.232 --> 00:05:27.601
Yes. You approve?

00:05:27.601 --> 00:05:29.370
Sure, Chris.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.472
Please promise us you'll
be very careful,

00:05:31.472 --> 00:05:32.973
and stay close to the others.

00:05:32.973 --> 00:05:34.508
I will.

00:05:39.814 --> 00:05:42.717
This should be an
interesting mission.

00:05:50.424 --> 00:05:52.426
Hm? What are those?

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:54.028
Here, Shadow.

00:05:54.028 --> 00:05:56.297
I made an extra one of these
to go with the one you had

00:05:56.297 --> 00:05:58.466
back on Space Colony ARK.

00:05:58.466 --> 00:05:59.967
Ah!

00:06:02.336 --> 00:06:05.506
One of those... was mine!

00:06:15.716 --> 00:06:16.917
Huh...

00:06:17.885 --> 00:06:18.853
Hm.

00:06:29.797 --> 00:06:30.998
Take them.

00:06:30.998 --> 00:06:32.967
If you wear them, you
won't lose energy

00:06:32.967 --> 00:06:35.636
when you're in the middle
of a fight anymore.

00:06:35.636 --> 00:06:36.837
I see.

00:06:36.837 --> 00:06:39.440
All right, I will wear them.

00:06:50.684 --> 00:06:52.353
Ready, team?

00:06:53.421 --> 00:06:55.356
Chaos Control!

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:11.605
I got something to help
us increase our speed!

00:07:13.607 --> 00:07:14.842
Hm!

00:07:16.177 --> 00:07:17.511
Thanks, Tails.

00:07:17.511 --> 00:07:19.880
We have a real advantage
over Eggman, now!

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.183
You'll need all the
help you can get.

00:07:22.183 --> 00:07:25.653
DECOE AND BOCOE: Hut-two!
Hut-two! Hut-two!

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:27.421
Why have you come to our ship?

00:07:27.421 --> 00:07:29.156
Now, now, Cream.

00:07:29.156 --> 00:07:31.091
Remember, we're on the same team.

00:07:31.091 --> 00:07:33.027
From now on, what's mine is yours,

00:07:33.027 --> 00:07:36.297
and what's yours is
all mine. [Chuckling]

00:07:36.297 --> 00:07:39.500
Back off! I'm not sharing
my stuff with you!

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.769
I'm just looking.

00:07:41.769 --> 00:07:42.736
Hm?

00:07:44.438 --> 00:07:49.477
[Both muttering]

00:07:49.477 --> 00:07:50.945
Very impressive.

00:07:50.945 --> 00:07:53.247
Your machines are well maintained.

00:07:53.247 --> 00:07:54.882
And clean, too!

00:07:55.449 --> 00:07:56.684
Oh!

00:07:56.684 --> 00:07:59.220
Hmm. Hm?

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.322
Hmm. Hm!

00:08:01.322 --> 00:08:02.723
Mm-hmm!

00:08:03.657 --> 00:08:06.794
Thumbs up, gang. Goodbye!

00:08:06.794 --> 00:08:10.498
Hut-two! Hut-two! Hut-two!

00:08:10.498 --> 00:08:13.167
That certainly was a strange visit.

00:08:13.167 --> 00:08:15.102
At least it was short.

00:08:15.102 --> 00:08:17.037
CHRIS: Chris to Blue Typhoon.

00:08:17.037 --> 00:08:18.973
Chaos Control successful.

00:08:18.973 --> 00:08:20.908
We're inside the base.

00:08:20.908 --> 00:08:24.078
We're gonna start looking for
the security system controls.

00:08:24.078 --> 00:08:25.813
We copy. Be careful, Chris.

00:08:25.813 --> 00:08:27.281
I will.

00:08:46.504 --> 00:08:47.472
All clear.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:52.877
Oh!

00:08:52.877 --> 00:08:53.978
Ah.

00:08:55.346 --> 00:08:57.282
[Chuckling]

00:08:58.082 --> 00:09:00.285
I have to think up some excuse

00:09:00.285 --> 00:09:03.054
to ditch these two so I can
look for the Chaos Emeralds.

00:09:03.054 --> 00:09:06.925
Say, why don't we split up to
look for that control room?

00:09:06.925 --> 00:09:07.892
No.

00:09:07.892 --> 00:09:08.860
Why not?

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.396
The Doctor wants us
to stay together.

00:09:11.396 --> 00:09:13.064
Oh, really?

00:09:13.064 --> 00:09:15.466
Looks like Eggman was
one step ahead of me.

00:09:15.466 --> 00:09:18.102
I'll have to change tactics.

00:09:21.472 --> 00:09:23.041
He knows I'm up to something.

00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:25.944
My only chance is to get
him to let his guard down.

00:09:25.944 --> 00:09:27.879
I'll have to turn on the charm.

00:09:27.879 --> 00:09:30.915
Remember the last time the
three of us used Chaos Control?

00:09:30.915 --> 00:09:34.352
As I recall, the circumstances
were rather explosive.

00:09:34.352 --> 00:09:35.954
You mean Prison Island!

00:09:35.954 --> 00:09:37.188
[Gasp]

00:09:37.188 --> 00:09:40.091
I was afraid Shadow
would leave me there.

00:09:40.091 --> 00:09:42.460
And do you remember
what happened next?

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:43.962
Of course I do.

00:09:43.962 --> 00:09:46.864
Shadow transported us
to Space Colony ARK.

00:09:46.864 --> 00:09:48.233
That's right.

00:09:48.233 --> 00:09:51.236
Shadow, wasn't that the
home of your friend, Maria?

00:09:51.236 --> 00:09:53.137
Maria!

00:09:56.541 --> 00:09:58.009
Maria!

00:09:58.643 --> 00:10:02.180
[Groaning]

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.248
Shadow!

00:10:03.248 --> 00:10:04.215
[Grunting]

00:10:04.215 --> 00:10:05.817
[Chuckling]

00:10:05.817 --> 00:10:07.385
Come back here!

00:10:07.385 --> 00:10:08.419
Sorry, boys.

00:10:08.419 --> 00:10:11.055
I have to go find
those Chaos Emeralds.

00:10:11.055 --> 00:10:12.257
[Gasp]

00:10:12.257 --> 00:10:13.291
[Metarex growling]

00:10:13.291 --> 00:10:14.959
Move it, creep!

00:10:14.959 --> 00:10:16.227
[Grunting]

00:10:16.227 --> 00:10:18.263
[Metarex growling]

00:10:19.864 --> 00:10:20.398
[Grunting]

00:10:20.398 --> 00:10:26.838
[Metarex growling]

00:10:26.838 --> 00:10:27.805
Aah!

00:10:28.206 --> 00:10:30.441
[Metarex roars]

00:10:31.776 --> 00:10:34.579
[Grunting]

00:10:34.579 --> 00:10:35.546
Ah!

00:10:40.551 --> 00:10:41.519
Oof.

00:10:42.487 --> 00:10:43.588
Don't run off.

00:10:44.322 --> 00:10:46.090
Since you put it that way.

00:10:47.859 --> 00:10:48.926
Hey, look!

00:10:48.926 --> 00:10:51.129
We may have found the control room.

00:10:52.797 --> 00:10:54.232
Wait up!

00:11:01.039 --> 00:11:02.407
We're in luck.

00:11:02.407 --> 00:11:05.209
This computer runs
the security system.

00:11:05.209 --> 00:11:06.077
Hmm.

00:11:25.963 --> 00:11:27.298
Do you read me?

00:11:27.298 --> 00:11:29.033
The computer's shut down.

00:11:30.001 --> 00:11:31.736
Good work, Chris!

00:11:31.736 --> 00:11:33.071
Ready?

00:11:35.173 --> 00:11:36.841
Let's go!

00:11:48.219 --> 00:11:49.587
Good luck!

00:11:49.587 --> 00:11:51.122
We know you can do it!

00:11:51.122 --> 00:11:52.190
Chao!

00:11:54.459 --> 00:11:56.027
Go get 'em, Doctor!

00:11:56.027 --> 00:11:57.795
Bring back those Emeralds!

00:11:57.795 --> 00:11:59.997
He doesn't stand a chance...

00:12:02.066 --> 00:12:03.968
We'd better step on it, Doctor.

00:12:03.968 --> 00:12:06.804
Sonic and the others are
already way ahead of us.

00:12:06.804 --> 00:12:08.406
There's no need to be nervous.

00:12:08.406 --> 00:12:10.174
Our competitors have fast machines,

00:12:10.174 --> 00:12:13.111
but my brain moves even faster.

00:12:14.579 --> 00:12:15.913
[Chuckling]

00:12:15.913 --> 00:12:18.549
I can't wait to spring
my surprise on Sonic.

00:12:35.833 --> 00:12:38.336
The Emerald is reacting.

00:12:38.336 --> 00:12:39.637
Try going right!

00:12:39.637 --> 00:12:41.105
Roger!

00:12:45.643 --> 00:12:47.578
Now! Through there!

00:12:51.549 --> 00:12:54.152
Whoa! You're goin' too fast!

00:12:54.152 --> 00:12:56.154
This isn't an amusement
park ride, ya know?

00:12:56.154 --> 00:12:57.121
Slow down!

00:12:57.121 --> 00:12:59.157
Aah! Are you crazy?!

00:12:59.157 --> 00:13:00.625
This isn't fast.

00:13:00.625 --> 00:13:01.859
Hang on!

00:13:01.859 --> 00:13:02.360
Heh!

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.262
Whoaaah!

00:13:04.262 --> 00:13:05.263
Aaaah

00:13:05.263 --> 00:13:06.664
Whooaaaa!

00:13:12.437 --> 00:13:15.973
I'll keep up no matter
how fast you go, Sonic.

00:13:17.108 --> 00:13:20.211
Amy, please, I'm starting
to feel really dizzy.

00:13:20.211 --> 00:13:21.946
I'm sorry, Cosmo.

00:13:21.946 --> 00:13:23.881
Do you see Eggman?

00:13:25.183 --> 00:13:26.951
He's still behind us.

00:13:26.951 --> 00:13:27.919
Okay.

00:13:27.919 --> 00:13:30.221
Keep an eye on him, just in case.

00:13:32.657 --> 00:13:35.560
[Evil chuckle]

00:13:43.381 --> 00:13:45.583
How much farther do we have to go?

00:13:46.217 --> 00:13:47.318
Almost there.

00:13:47.318 --> 00:13:48.586
All right.

00:13:54.725 --> 00:13:55.693
Hurry!

00:13:55.693 --> 00:13:57.962
Don't worry. I'll catch up.

00:14:01.299 --> 00:14:03.267
It's show time!

00:14:05.503 --> 00:14:07.271
Aah!

00:14:07.271 --> 00:14:08.873
What's the matter?

00:14:08.873 --> 00:14:10.174
[Gasp] I don't know!

00:14:10.174 --> 00:14:12.276
I've lost control of my plane!

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:21.185
Maybe this will fix it! [Knocking]

00:14:21.185 --> 00:14:23.454
[Panting]

00:14:26.591 --> 00:14:27.658
What do you want?

00:14:27.658 --> 00:14:28.993
Grab it!

00:14:30.128 --> 00:14:31.395
[Both gasp]

00:14:32.029 --> 00:14:33.731
Bye-bye, girls!

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.102
We have to get that
Emerald back, Amy.

00:14:38.102 --> 00:14:39.704
The controls aren't working!

00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:43.574
We've been shut out!

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.552
It looks like we lost Amy.

00:14:54.552 --> 00:14:56.254
We'll get 'em on the way back.

00:14:56.254 --> 00:14:58.956
Tell me how the Chaos
Emerald's reacting.

00:14:58.956 --> 00:15:00.858
You should go up!

00:15:08.166 --> 00:15:10.101
We've got company.

00:15:10.101 --> 00:15:11.169
No problem!

00:15:11.169 --> 00:15:15.940
Whoa, whoa, wh-wh-whoooaaa!

00:15:23.347 --> 00:15:25.616
It sure is a long way down.

00:15:25.616 --> 00:15:28.786
If we lose power, we will
take quite a tumble.

00:15:34.358 --> 00:15:37.161
[Metarex growling]

00:15:37.161 --> 00:15:37.828
[Grunting]

00:15:37.828 --> 00:15:40.765
[Metarex screams]

00:15:46.771 --> 00:15:49.373
[Grunting]

00:15:51.642 --> 00:15:53.311
Take that!

00:15:57.582 --> 00:15:59.650
The Chaos Emeralds
must be up there!

00:16:02.553 --> 00:16:04.155
You're right, Eggman!

00:16:04.155 --> 00:16:06.891
Now lets see which one of
us can get to them first.

00:16:06.891 --> 00:16:07.792
Aah!

00:16:07.792 --> 00:16:11.996
Sonic, haven't you ever
heard of passenger safety?

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.299
Sonic, you tried your best,

00:16:15.299 --> 00:16:17.401
but you're out of control.

00:16:17.401 --> 00:16:19.637
Why are you slowing down, Sonic?

00:16:19.637 --> 00:16:20.905
It's not me!

00:16:20.905 --> 00:16:23.074
The controls aren't working!

00:16:23.074 --> 00:16:25.009
Now we're heading the wrong way!

00:16:25.009 --> 00:16:26.677
What do you think you're doing?!

00:16:26.677 --> 00:16:28.779
It's not my fault, I swear!

00:16:30.948 --> 00:16:32.550
[Evil laughter]

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:33.517
Ah!

00:16:33.517 --> 00:16:34.752
Now, stop.

00:16:34.752 --> 00:16:37.455
Isn't this an interesting twist?

00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:39.957
Eggman's using a controller!

00:16:39.957 --> 00:16:41.492
Quit goofing around!

00:16:41.492 --> 00:16:42.793
That's cheating!

00:16:42.793 --> 00:16:44.629
[Evil chuckle]

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:48.199
I prefer to think of it as bending
the rules until they break!

00:16:48.766 --> 00:16:49.767
Yah!

00:16:49.767 --> 00:16:50.835
Huh!

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:53.638
Come back!

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:55.039
Later, losers!

00:16:55.039 --> 00:16:56.607
Thanks for the gems, gents!

00:16:57.341 --> 00:16:58.509
Aah!

00:16:58.509 --> 00:17:01.879
Whoa!

00:17:01.879 --> 00:17:05.449
Soon, all the Chaos Emeralds
will belong to yours truly.

00:17:05.449 --> 00:17:07.418
[Evil chuckle]

00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:14.759
Sonic! Wanna go for a spin?

00:17:14.759 --> 00:17:15.660
Okay!

00:17:18.162 --> 00:17:19.997
[Grunting]

00:17:23.134 --> 00:17:24.535
Victory!

00:17:24.535 --> 00:17:25.503
[Grunting]

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:27.438
Guh...

00:17:27.438 --> 00:17:29.774
Hey, where did they go?

00:17:30.741 --> 00:17:31.609
[Grunting]

00:17:31.609 --> 00:17:33.878
Whoa!

00:17:33.878 --> 00:17:36.280
Looks like my side
won, two to nothing.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.318
[All stammering]

00:17:40.318 --> 00:17:44.088
ALL: Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

00:17:44.088 --> 00:17:45.423
Oof!

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.062
Don't move!

00:17:51.062 --> 00:17:53.297
We're hanging by a thread, here!

00:17:53.297 --> 00:17:54.398
Huh?

00:18:00.771 --> 00:18:03.541
I'd be happy to help
you down, Eggman.

00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:05.109
[All quivering nervously]

00:18:05.109 --> 00:18:06.444
Uh... thanks, anyway!

00:18:06.444 --> 00:18:09.080
We're fine! [Cowering]

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.215
Ha!

00:18:13.451 --> 00:18:15.052
What was that?

00:18:23.361 --> 00:18:25.396
Oh! Sonic!

00:18:26.197 --> 00:18:27.164
Ah!

00:18:27.164 --> 00:18:28.899
I can't wrestle now!

00:18:28.899 --> 00:18:30.034
Whoa! Ah!

00:18:30.034 --> 00:18:33.604
I just realized there is an upside
to getting separated from you,

00:18:33.604 --> 00:18:36.807
'cause it's so great
when we're re-united.

00:18:37.441 --> 00:18:39.343
[Groaning]

00:18:45.683 --> 00:18:49.053
So, we finally tracked down
all the Chaos Emeralds.

00:18:49.053 --> 00:18:51.021
Isn't it wonderful?

00:18:51.021 --> 00:18:52.957
Uh, what's that thing, Sonic?

00:18:52.957 --> 00:18:53.824
Huh?

00:18:53.824 --> 00:18:57.461
It looks like... a Planet Egg!

00:18:57.461 --> 00:18:59.563
But it's growing out of control!

00:18:59.563 --> 00:19:03.267
I've never seen a Planet
Egg that big before.

00:19:03.267 --> 00:19:04.368
Chao!

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.806
The Metarex have been
gathering Planet Eggs

00:19:08.806 --> 00:19:10.141
from around the galaxy.

00:19:10.141 --> 00:19:12.443
It looks like they're using the
power of the Chaos Emeralds

00:19:12.443 --> 00:19:14.845
to force the Eggs into evolving.

00:19:14.845 --> 00:19:17.114
Really? But why, Tails?

00:19:17.114 --> 00:19:19.250
That is our secret.

00:19:30.461 --> 00:19:35.566
So, we face each other
again, Sonic the Hedgehog.

00:19:36.267 --> 00:19:37.768
No way!

00:19:38.736 --> 00:19:41.639
You're the guy who tried to take
the Chaos Emeralds from me.

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:43.574
I'll never forget that fight.

00:19:43.574 --> 00:19:46.477
Because of you, I had to
throw the Emeralds away.

00:19:50.581 --> 00:19:51.849
You know him?

00:19:51.849 --> 00:19:52.783
Grr!

00:19:52.783 --> 00:19:54.251
Unfortunately, I do.

00:19:54.251 --> 00:19:55.152
Grr...

00:19:55.152 --> 00:19:57.555
Allow me to introduce myself.

00:19:57.555 --> 00:20:02.126
I am Dark Oak, ruler
of the Metarex.

00:20:02.126 --> 00:20:06.964
And now, Sonic, you and I
are going to have a rematch.
