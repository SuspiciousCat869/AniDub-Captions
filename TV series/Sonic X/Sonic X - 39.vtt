Ribbit! Ribbit! Ribbit!

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:06.406
Hey, Froggy!

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:09.309
It sure is a nice day.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:10.477
Huh?

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:17.384
Woah, that's pretty!

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:19.353
Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit!

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:20.487
Ribbit, ribbit!

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:28.395
Hm. Woah! Ugh!

[Groan]

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:38.171
There've been five confirmed
reports so far, Mr. President.

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:40.107
It seems that most of the buildings

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:43.010
have landed in parts of the
city closest to Mystic Ruin.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.810
Great.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.413
And what about all the
creatures they found inside?

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:49.283
The bird-like ones are
known as "Flickies," sir.

00:00:49.283 --> 00:00:53.554
And I'm assuming they all come
from the same world as Sonic.

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:55.188
Right, Professor Thorndyke?

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:57.724
Yep. It would appear that way.

00:00:58.225 --> 00:00:59.393
I see.

00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:01.361
Now, then. I'm sure
you must be wondering

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:04.231
why I asked you and your
grandson here this afternoon.

00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:06.934
You're worried about the
arrival of these creatures.

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:10.003
And you're thinking you need
to separate them from humans.

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:11.438
You're concerned
there'll be trouble

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:14.641
between two such different species
unless they're... dealt with.

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:17.077
We wish we didn't
have to. It's just-

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:18.512
Don't apologize.

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:22.115
We understand your
situation completely.

00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:29.489
Go, go, go, go, go

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:32.593
Gotta go fast

00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:35.529
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:37.798 --> 00:01:41.335
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:43.370

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.439
Stuck in a new location

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.042
Without any explanation

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:51.111
No talk of relaxation

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:52.746
Don't, don't, don't

00:01:52.746 --> 00:01:54.548
Don't blink, don't think

00:01:54.548 --> 00:01:56.350
Just go, go, go, go

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.851
Go, go

00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:03.390
Sonic is on the run

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.292
Sonic, he's number one

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:08.996
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:02:08.996 --> 00:02:12.699
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:15.068

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:16.970
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.506
Sonic X

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:21.441
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:24.244
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:25.278
Sonic X

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.157
Have ya heard?

00:02:33.157 --> 00:02:35.993
A couple of more friends
from back home dropped in.

00:02:35.993 --> 00:02:39.530
Seems every day is like a
regular reunion around here.

00:02:40.331 --> 00:02:42.767
'Course, if too many
of us start showing up,

00:02:42.767 --> 00:02:44.835
the humans aren't
gonna be too happy.

00:02:44.835 --> 00:02:47.305
They'll probably decide
we're "dangerous,"

00:02:47.305 --> 00:02:48.706
and round us all up.

00:02:48.706 --> 00:02:55.046
Imagine. Us! Together! 24/7.

00:02:55.046 --> 00:02:57.949
My, I wonder what that'd
be like. Don't you?

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:59.150
[Yelp]

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.585
Get this straight!

00:03:00.585 --> 00:03:03.788
I'd rather live in solitary
confinement, than with you!

00:03:03.788 --> 00:03:05.923
Don't get so excited, sweetie.

00:03:05.923 --> 00:03:08.859
I'm only saying that the authorities
won't like our kind around.

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:10.795
Believe me, I don't like the idea

00:03:10.795 --> 00:03:12.730
of being locked up
any more than you do.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.068
Hmph.

00:03:17.068 --> 00:03:20.938
I should've realized that the welcome
mat wouldn't be out forever.

00:03:20.938 --> 00:03:23.207
Yeah. Too good to be true.

00:03:23.207 --> 00:03:25.076
One day they love us
because we're unique.

00:03:25.076 --> 00:03:27.812
And the next day we're in
jail because we're different.

00:03:27.812 --> 00:03:28.779
[Sigh]

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:31.048
Well, they won't take
me without a fight.

00:03:31.048 --> 00:03:32.984
Now, that's the right attitude!

00:03:33.951 --> 00:03:37.054
Oh, well. We'll just have
to make the best of it.

00:03:37.588 --> 00:03:38.723
When they come to get us,

00:03:38.723 --> 00:03:40.925
I hope you're around to protect me.

00:03:42.526 --> 00:03:43.628
Well, I'm off!

00:03:43.628 --> 00:03:45.796
Oh, and there's just
one more thing.

00:03:45.796 --> 00:03:47.031
What's that?

00:03:47.031 --> 00:03:48.699
I hope we share a cell.

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:49.667
Oh!

00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:51.936
You're batty!!!

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.192
Don't know about you, Chris,
but I'm pretty hungry.

00:04:15.192 --> 00:04:17.161
Why don't we go on home and
have a little of Ella's-

00:04:17.161 --> 00:04:18.663
CHRIS: Grandpa?
GRANDPA: Huh?

00:04:20.131 --> 00:04:22.066
I've been thinking...

00:04:22.066 --> 00:04:24.468
about what the president said?

00:04:24.468 --> 00:04:26.437
Do you really think
they're gonna...

00:04:26.437 --> 00:04:28.372
take Sonic away?

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:36.947
I mean...

00:04:36.947 --> 00:04:38.482
I know he's different,

00:04:38.482 --> 00:04:40.418
but why should that matter?

00:04:41.585 --> 00:04:44.989
Deep down, he's just
like you and me.

00:04:44.989 --> 00:04:47.725
I know.

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:57.468
[Frustrated scream]

00:04:57.468 --> 00:05:01.706
Leave it to Charmy to take his
own, sweet time getting here!

00:05:02.173 --> 00:05:05.676
I'd say we've got more important
things to worry about.

00:05:05.676 --> 00:05:07.978
Like where we are, for instance.

00:05:07.978 --> 00:05:11.182
And how did the three of us
get here in the first place?

00:05:11.182 --> 00:05:13.117
And how do we get back?

00:05:13.117 --> 00:05:15.720
Your guess is as
good as mine, Espio.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.055
I'm just as confused as you are!

00:05:18.055 --> 00:05:20.591
Did we travel through
time, somehow?

00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:22.226
Or space, maybe?

00:05:22.226 --> 00:05:23.828
Which one do you think happened?

00:05:23.828 --> 00:05:25.429
What difference does it make?

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:27.565
All that matters is
we're stuck here!

00:05:27.565 --> 00:05:29.300
And since we're stuck here,

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.902
we oughtta concentrate
on a bigger question.

00:05:31.902 --> 00:05:33.170
What's that?

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.106
Why is half of the moon missing?!

00:05:40.811 --> 00:05:41.846

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.982
Hey! What'll you hear, Vector!

00:05:44.982 --> 00:05:47.451
You won't believe it in a
million, trillion years!

00:05:47.451 --> 00:05:49.386
What won't I believe?

00:05:49.386 --> 00:05:52.590
We got blown into a
whole different world!

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.491
Huh?

00:05:53.491 --> 00:05:55.926
And the proof's right
here in this newspaper!

00:05:55.926 --> 00:05:56.694

00:05:56.694 --> 00:05:57.261
See?

Charmy!

00:05:58.362 --> 00:05:59.697
Woah! Uh-huh?

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.536
All right. Where are we, Charmy?

00:06:05.536 --> 00:06:06.337

Ah! Good evening, sir.

I wanted to apologize for
that nasty ARK business.

That was so unfortunate.

very sorry I am to have

caused such a calamity,

to mend the moon for you,

free of charge.

00:11:56.042 --> 00:11:57.744
It's the least I could do.

That's... good news, Eggman.

round won't be easy,

a whole lot of elbow grease,

up in a jiffy. Okay?

It appears the moon has been repaired
by the notorious Dr. Eggman.

took him ten minutes?

00:17:17.147 --> 00:17:19.383
I've simply had a change of heart.

00:17:19.383 --> 00:17:21.318
I know it may surprise you, Sonic,

00:17:21.318 --> 00:17:24.788
but even eggcentric geniuses
like myself have hearts.

00:17:24.788 --> 00:17:26.390
That so?

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:27.691
I kid you not.

00:17:29.259 --> 00:17:32.162
It isn't easy being an evil madman.

00:17:32.663 --> 00:17:34.097
It's hard work.

00:17:35.298 --> 00:17:36.500
I don't buy it.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.301
I really mean it, Sonic.

00:17:38.301 --> 00:17:41.204
Building evil robots
to do my bidding...

00:17:41.204 --> 00:17:44.808
Creating a Chaos Creature
just for kicks...

00:17:44.808 --> 00:17:47.911
Sometimes I think,
what's the point?

00:17:47.911 --> 00:17:50.614
Maybe I should just chuck
it and retire somewhere

00:17:50.614 --> 00:17:52.549
far, far away.

00:17:53.183 --> 00:17:55.318
You might have something
there, Eggman.

00:17:55.318 --> 00:17:57.254
[Chuckle]

00:17:57.254 --> 00:17:59.322
Can't you just see it, Sonic?

00:17:59.322 --> 00:18:01.758
Goodbye, world domination.

00:18:01.758 --> 00:18:03.527
Hello, shuffleboard!

00:18:03.527 --> 00:18:04.661
[Chuckle]

00:18:04.661 --> 00:18:05.996
Hey, are you on the level here,

00:18:05.996 --> 00:18:08.732
or is this just another
one of your schemes?

00:18:08.732 --> 00:18:10.133
Excuse me...

00:18:10.133 --> 00:18:11.601
It can't be!

00:18:12.536 --> 00:18:14.571
What do you weirdos want?

00:18:14.571 --> 00:18:16.106
You know what we want!

00:18:16.106 --> 00:18:18.108
Drop the innocent act, kiddo!

00:18:18.108 --> 00:18:19.076
Give up!

00:18:19.076 --> 00:18:21.011
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:18:21.011 --> 00:18:22.946
Tails, do you know these two?

00:18:23.914 --> 00:18:26.450
I've never seen them
before in my life, Chris.

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:28.385
Quit your stalling, will ya?

00:18:28.952 --> 00:18:31.621
Now, hand over that
little bunny, or else!

00:18:31.621 --> 00:18:32.656
Yeah! Or else!

00:18:32.656 --> 00:18:36.093
Sorry, sir, but where
would you take me?

00:18:36.093 --> 00:18:36.893
Chao chao!

00:18:36.893 --> 00:18:38.829
You don't think we'd
let them take you?

00:18:38.829 --> 00:18:40.630
Just asking...

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:43.533
Aah! There's the bodyguard monster!

00:18:43.533 --> 00:18:44.835
Aah!

00:18:44.835 --> 00:18:46.436
We'll get you!

00:18:46.436 --> 00:18:47.404
Charmy?

00:18:47.404 --> 00:18:48.405
Get ready!

00:18:48.405 --> 00:18:50.006
[Struggling]

00:18:50.006 --> 00:18:51.708
All right, you creeps.

00:18:51.708 --> 00:18:52.943
You asked for it!

00:18:52.943 --> 00:18:57.814
[Sounds of fighting]

00:18:57.814 --> 00:18:59.549
What's goin' on here?

00:18:59.549 --> 00:19:02.419
Sonic! Help us! We're
being attacked!

00:19:02.419 --> 00:19:03.386
Well, look who's here!

00:19:03.386 --> 00:19:05.388
If it ain't Sonic the Kidnapper!

00:19:05.388 --> 00:19:07.624
I'm no kidnapper, pal.

00:19:07.624 --> 00:19:08.792
[Fighting continues]

00:19:08.792 --> 00:19:12.529
Woah... It's-it's you!

00:19:12.529 --> 00:19:15.365
How nice to see you
again, Detective.

00:19:15.365 --> 00:19:16.767
Hey, look, Cream!

00:19:16.767 --> 00:19:18.401
Someone's here to see ya.

00:19:18.401 --> 00:19:19.336
Huh?

00:19:19.336 --> 00:19:20.737
Oh!

00:19:26.209 --> 00:19:28.145
I finally found...

00:19:28.145 --> 00:19:29.780
My baby!

00:19:31.715 --> 00:19:34.184
Mom? Ma?

00:19:35.552 --> 00:19:36.520
Mom?

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:39.389
[Squealing in joy]

00:19:39.389 --> 00:19:40.957
Oh! My baby!

00:19:40.957 --> 00:19:46.229
[Both crying]

00:19:46.229 --> 00:19:47.597
Cream's mother!

00:19:51.768 --> 00:19:54.704
How can I ever repay
you, Detective Vector?

00:19:54.704 --> 00:19:57.073
Aww, no sweat.

00:19:57.073 --> 00:19:58.575
And thank you, Sonic,

00:19:58.575 --> 00:20:00.977
for taking such good
care of my little girl.

00:20:00.977 --> 00:20:02.445
I'm so grateful.

00:20:02.445 --> 00:20:03.413
Huh?

00:20:03.413 --> 00:20:05.215
Grateful? But-

00:20:05.215 --> 00:20:06.817
What did Sonic do?

00:20:06.817 --> 00:20:08.251
You remember me, Vector.

00:20:08.251 --> 00:20:10.153
I'm Sonic the Kidnapper!

00:20:10.153 --> 00:20:11.521
Hey, my old pal, Sonic!

00:20:11.521 --> 00:20:13.056
Fancy meeting you here!

00:20:13.056 --> 00:20:13.890
Come on, Charmy.

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:16.193
We don't want to be late
for our next job, do we?

00:20:16.193 --> 00:20:18.128
What's the big rush, Vector?

00:20:18.128 --> 00:20:19.629
Stick around, why don't ya?

00:20:19.629 --> 00:20:22.465
Yeah! We were just getting
into the swing of things.

00:20:22.465 --> 00:20:24.568
Thanks anyway, but
time's a-wastin',

00:20:24.568 --> 00:20:25.902
and I'm busy!

00:20:25.902 --> 00:20:28.538
I detect a little
uneasiness, Detective.

00:20:28.538 --> 00:20:31.241
[All laughing]

00:20:31.241 --> 00:20:34.611
[Evil chuckling]

00:20:35.245 --> 00:20:36.213
Heh...

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:39.115
Sounds like quite the party.

00:20:39.115 --> 00:20:42.085
Laugh while you can,
Sonic. You sucker.

00:20:42.085 --> 00:20:44.020
[Evil chuckle]

00:20:49.059 --> 00:20:50.260
Hey, you guys.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:51.962
Help me out here, will ya?
