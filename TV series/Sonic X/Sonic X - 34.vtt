Suspect is in custody.

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:17.317
Well, from what I heard,

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:20.287
you caused quite a ruckus over
at Prison Island the other night.

00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:22.189
Now we can't get two words outta ya.

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.925

I gotta get the jump on these flyguys.

Uh-oh! They mean business!

00:02:45.475 --> 00:02:48.178
Could I possibly sink any lower?

00:02:50.547 --> 00:02:53.083
I mean, I haven't done
anything wrong, have I?

00:02:53.083 --> 00:02:55.985
I just wonder what it is they think I did.

00:02:59.422 --> 00:03:01.925
Hey, Chris! I heard you
come from Station Square.

00:03:01.925 --> 00:03:03.860
Uh, yeah?

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.362
Have you ever seen Sonic
the Hedgehog up close?

00:03:06.362 --> 00:03:08.231
Uh... Sonic?

00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:10.300
Well, sorta.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.036
What's he like? Is he really that fast?

00:03:13.036 --> 00:03:14.971
You bet he's fast!

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:18.341
He's faster than anybody.

00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:20.777
And he's nicer than anybody, too.

00:03:20.777 --> 00:03:22.378
Wish I could meet him.

00:03:22.378 --> 00:03:23.346
Ha.

00:03:23.346 --> 00:03:26.583
Who knows. If we're lucky, maybe
we'll both get to meet him some day!

00:03:26.583 --> 00:03:29.119
Well, I gotta get to class. Later!

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:30.687
See ya!

00:03:41.664 --> 00:03:44.334
Mr. President. It appears
our undercover operative

00:03:44.334 --> 00:03:46.002
has settled into his new mission,

00:03:46.002 --> 00:03:48.471
and will have all of the resources necessary.

00:03:48.905 --> 00:03:49.973
Good work.

00:03:49.973 --> 00:03:51.875
And what about the flood?

00:03:51.875 --> 00:03:55.545
Well, sir. I've read the full
report over the last few days.

00:03:55.545 --> 00:03:56.880
There was some damage,

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.081
but from what I can gather,

00:03:58.081 --> 00:04:00.984
none of the citizens were harmed in any way.

00:04:00.984 --> 00:04:02.318
And what about Sonic?

00:04:02.318 --> 00:04:04.387
Is there any new information?

00:04:04.387 --> 00:04:06.322
I'm afraid it doesn't look good.

00:04:06.322 --> 00:04:08.758
And with a crime of this magnitude, sir,

00:04:08.758 --> 00:04:10.994
I'm not sure the government
should get involved.

00:04:10.994 --> 00:04:12.595
I don't know.

00:04:12.595 --> 00:04:14.631
This just doesn't sound like him.

00:04:14.631 --> 00:04:16.399
I agree with ya, sir.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:17.500
Huh?

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.969
Sonic would never do such a thing.

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:22.672
I think he's been wrongly
accused, Mr. President,

00:04:22.672 --> 00:04:24.941
and I think you should do something about it.

00:04:24.941 --> 00:04:26.876
Just... drive.

00:04:27.243 --> 00:04:31.614
Either way, I don't feel it would
look good for us to be involved.

00:04:31.614 --> 00:04:33.416
We should wash our hands of him.

00:04:33.416 --> 00:04:35.451
Do you really think so?

00:04:35.451 --> 00:04:36.920
I do, sir.

Mr. President? I have some bad news.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.880
Sonic was just seen at the
National Museum of Art,

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.681
attempting to steal the Chaos Emerald.

00:05:38.681 --> 00:05:40.183
It can't be!

00:05:40.183 --> 00:05:42.585
My men are awaiting your instructions, sir.

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:44.520
We have no choice.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.456
Find him and place him under arrest.

00:05:46.456 --> 00:05:48.024
Yes, Mr. President.

00:05:48.024 --> 00:05:51.294
I'll alert all divisions immediately, sir.

Attention all division commanders!

00:05:56.733 --> 00:05:59.669
Sonic the Hedgehog has gone underground.

Let's go get him!

00:06:12.148 --> 00:06:14.150
And now a breaking news story.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.420
I'm standing in the main pavilion
of the National Museum of Art,

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.123
where earlier tonight, a
thief broke through security

00:06:20.123 --> 00:06:22.625
and stole a priceless Chaos Emerald.

00:06:22.625 --> 00:06:24.961
Authorities found these images on tapes

00:06:24.961 --> 00:06:27.864
confiscated from the
museum's security cameras.

00:06:28.831 --> 00:06:30.466

00:06:34.771 --> 00:06:36.105
Was that Sonic?

00:06:36.105 --> 00:06:37.240
It can't be!

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.076
Sonic would never take something
that didn't belong to him.

00:06:40.076 --> 00:06:42.211
Chao chao chao chao chao chao!

00:06:42.211 --> 00:06:45.748
Yeah, right. That was Sonic
on those security tapes.

00:06:45.748 --> 00:06:46.716
It can't be!

00:06:46.716 --> 00:06:47.684
He was framed!

00:06:47.684 --> 00:06:48.651
That's right!

00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:49.752
Chao chao!

00:06:49.752 --> 00:06:52.055
Uh, maybe it wasn't him.

00:06:52.055 --> 00:06:54.257
I guess you can't always believe your eyes.

00:06:54.257 --> 00:06:55.525
Surprisingly enough,

00:06:55.525 --> 00:06:57.560
authorities have determined from this footage

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.730
that the thief is none other
than Sonic the Hedgehog.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.031
According to reports,

00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:03.933
Sonic has destroyed numerous government tanks

00:07:03.933 --> 00:07:06.202
and fled to an unknown location.

00:07:06.202 --> 00:07:07.437
But there...

00:07:07.437 --> 00:07:09.372
There must be some kind of mistake!

00:07:09.706 --> 00:07:12.475
Sonic wouldn't... [sigh]

00:07:12.475 --> 00:07:14.978
Of course he wouldn't, Mr. Chris!

00:07:14.978 --> 00:07:17.280
I'm sure there are some explanations!

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.948
Hmm...

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:25.621

Sonic ain't no thief.

00:07:52.248 --> 00:07:54.183
I wouldn't make this up!

00:07:54.183 --> 00:07:57.086
I saw it on a TV in a repair shop window.

00:07:57.086 --> 00:07:59.022
Would I like to you? No.

00:07:59.022 --> 00:08:01.557
I tell you, they saw him steal the thing.

Hey...

00:08:02.825 --> 00:08:04.093
And not only that,

00:08:04.093 --> 00:08:07.296
they caught him breaking into
Prison Island just last night!

00:08:07.296 --> 00:08:08.631
Red-handed!

00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:10.833
Probably trying to steal government secrets.

[Cry of shock]

Woah!

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:31.287
How did you manage to get permission
for me to visit Prison Island?

00:08:31.287 --> 00:08:35.158
Well, let's just say I have
connections in high places.

00:08:45.201 --> 00:08:47.136
Who are you, exactly?

00:08:47.136 --> 00:08:49.739
Just a fellow newshound, that's all.

00:08:56.913 --> 00:09:01.117
Have you ever heard of a government
operation called Project Shadow?

00:09:01.117 --> 00:09:03.086
I'm afraid that's top secret.

00:09:03.086 --> 00:09:05.354
However, after last night,

00:09:05.354 --> 00:09:08.491
I'm not sure how much longer
it will stay secret.

00:09:08.491 --> 00:09:09.625
Take a look.

00:09:10.359 --> 00:09:13.729
This is security cam video from last night.

00:09:14.297 --> 00:09:18.634
As you can see, Eggman and the
hedgehog had broken into the system.

00:09:18.634 --> 00:09:21.571
And they're trying to steal
the Project Shadow file.

00:09:22.238 --> 00:09:25.141
This videotape makes it clear as day.

00:09:25.775 --> 00:09:29.011
Sonic is no longer concerned
with the safety of our citizens,

00:09:29.011 --> 00:09:31.881
and has decided to join
forces with the enemy.

00:09:31.881 --> 00:09:34.183
He had us all fooled, didn't he?

00:09:34.183 --> 00:09:36.419
What happens next, sir?

00:09:36.419 --> 00:09:37.386
Quite simple.

00:09:37.386 --> 00:09:40.289
We arrest him and try him for high treason.

Good evening.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:01.254
I must say it's a pleasure to finally
meet you face-to-face, Sonic.

00:11:01.254 --> 00:11:04.491
We do look alike. It's uncanny.

00:11:04.491 --> 00:11:05.959
Wait a minute!

00:11:05.959 --> 00:11:09.329
So it's <i>you</i> that's been gettin'
me in all this hot water lately!

Huh? Oh! Oh!

00:11:18.004 --> 00:11:21.141
Hmm... It certainly <i>looks</i> like Sonic.

00:11:21.141 --> 00:11:25.145
Still, there's something...
strange... different about him.

00:11:28.048 --> 00:11:29.349
Huh?

00:11:34.421 --> 00:11:37.824
I assure you, Sonic. I'm no imposter.

00:11:37.824 --> 00:11:42.462
I possess far too much power to
be anything but the real thing.

00:11:42.462 --> 00:11:43.897
Well, if you're so powerful,

00:11:43.897 --> 00:11:45.932
let's see ya prove it!

[Evil laugh]

Hey, not bad! I'm almost impressed!

You're kidding!

Well, be sure to call us right
away if anything else happens.

That was your father.

Apparently Sonic's been spotted battling
a government robot on Downhill St.

Chris, where are you going?

00:12:24.404 --> 00:12:27.307
I will follow him, Mr. Thorndyke.

What just happened?

00:13:08.348 --> 00:13:11.251
Sonic's a bit overwhelmed, isn't he?

00:13:11.851 --> 00:13:13.820
I certainly can't blame him.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.922
I certainly felt rather confused myself

00:13:15.922 --> 00:13:18.925

My name is Shadow.

You've awakened me from a

You've met your match, Sonic!

00:14:09.376 --> 00:14:11.311
Compared to Shadow's fancy footwork,

00:14:11.311 --> 00:14:13.246
you're as slow as a mound of molasses!

00:14:13.246 --> 00:14:15.849
And now that you two have gotten
a bit better acquainted,

00:14:15.849 --> 00:14:18.151
you're sure to see that for yourself!

You can do better than that, Sonic.

00:20:01.359 --> 00:20:03.427
You two take care of yourselves.

00:20:04.061 --> 00:20:06.330
Why do we have to dress
like this, Mr. Tanaka?

00:20:06.998 --> 00:20:09.901
I am inspired by my boyhood hero.

00:20:13.204 --> 00:20:15.139
Come on! Step on it!

00:20:15.139 --> 00:20:18.042
We've got to get to Prison Island in a hurry!

00:20:18.042 --> 00:20:19.710
What a bossy-

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:20.611
What did you say?

00:20:20.611 --> 00:20:22.013
Uh...

00:20:28.753 --> 00:20:30.254
What a day.

00:20:30.254 --> 00:20:33.591
Who'da thought I'd be thrown in
jail for something I didn't do?

00:20:33.591 --> 00:20:36.727
I'd better think fast. Use my time wisely.

00:20:36.727 --> 00:20:39.630
And figure out who that Shadow was...

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:41.966
and what he wants.
