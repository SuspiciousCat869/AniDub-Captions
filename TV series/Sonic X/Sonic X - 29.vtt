00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.969
Last time on Sonic X.

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:04.238
Sonic and Tails discovered another Emerald,

00:00:04.238 --> 00:00:07.574
but it was soon devoured by
Dr. Eggman's Chaos creature.

00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:09.243
A fierce battle followed,

00:00:09.243 --> 00:00:11.445
and the X Tornado went down in flames.

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:14.281
But thanks to Tails' expert piloting skills,

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:16.683
our battered heroes survived to fight on.

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:19.786
Unfortunately, Eggman wasn't
finished making mischief,

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:22.389
as he seized Amy and her new friend Lily.

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:24.658
For once, Sonic arrived too late.

00:00:24.658 --> 00:00:26.460
Now his speed isn't enough.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.997
This time, he'll have to think fast
if he's going to catch up with Eggman.

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.765
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:34.835

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.771
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:43.610
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.646
Got ourselves a situation

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:47.714
Stuck in a new location

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:51.318
Without any explanation

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.387
No talk of relaxation

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.022
Don't, don't, don't

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:56.823
Don't blink, don't think

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:58.625
Just go, go, go, go

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.127
Go, go

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:05.666
Sonic is on the run

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.534
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:11.271
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

KNUCKLES: <i>I was supposed to</i>
<i>guard the Master Emerald.</i>

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.143
But now I only have one piece of it.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.046
What's the use in going on?

00:01:54.046 --> 00:01:55.347
It's over.

00:01:55.347 --> 00:01:56.948
I failed.

Standing around feeling sorry for
myself won't make things right.

00:02:13.365 --> 00:02:15.367
I couldn't stop the Master
Emerald from being destroyed,

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:16.835
but I can gather what's left.

00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:18.236
I wasted enough time moping.

00:02:18.236 --> 00:02:20.072
I'd better get on with the search!

00:02:20.072 --> 00:02:22.574

Ready!

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.962
I only hope they'll be able to find Amy.

00:02:43.962 --> 00:02:46.732
With Eggman and those crazy robots of his,

00:02:46.732 --> 00:02:48.467
who knows what could happen to her?

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:52.471
I'm sure that Sonic won't give up until
he brings her back here safe and sound.

00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:53.939
Sure.

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:55.874
Do you think she's okay?

00:02:55.874 --> 00:02:57.242
Chao, chao!

00:02:57.242 --> 00:02:58.777
Don't you worry, Cream.

00:02:58.777 --> 00:03:00.445
I'm sure she's just fine.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.083
You shouldn't try to take on Eggman so soon.

00:03:05.083 --> 00:03:06.051
I feel fine.

00:03:06.051 --> 00:03:07.719
I can handle him, Sonic.

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:10.589
You're a great pilot, Tails,
but I'd better do this alone.

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:12.257
Wait, Sonic!

00:03:12.257 --> 00:03:13.592
We're a team!

00:03:13.592 --> 00:03:15.894
We have to figure out where Eggman took Amy.

00:03:15.894 --> 00:03:17.863
It'll be easier with two of us looking.

00:03:17.863 --> 00:03:20.565
Amy's probably in danger and
there's no time to lose.

00:03:20.565 --> 00:03:22.267
Let's both look, Sonic!

00:03:22.267 --> 00:03:23.535
I know we can find her!

00:03:23.535 --> 00:03:26.071
I guess we do have a better
chance working together.

00:03:26.071 --> 00:03:28.006
Right! We're a team!

00:03:28.006 --> 00:03:29.341

00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:30.909
how come you're outside?

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:34.146
It's more to ride the X Tornado
outside in the open air!

00:03:34.146 --> 00:03:36.047
Okay, ya better hold on tight!

00:03:36.047 --> 00:03:37.282
Yeah!

We have to find Froggy, fast!

Before Dr. Eggman figures out
he swallowed a Chaos Emerald!

00:03:56.868 --> 00:04:01.540
It may not seem like it, Chris,
but I know just what I'm doing.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.208
Trust me!

00:04:03.742 --> 00:04:05.410
