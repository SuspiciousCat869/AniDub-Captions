WEBVTT

00:00:01.435 --> 00:00:02.302
Huh...

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.615
Huh...

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:19.486
Where are we?

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:23.190
Come on! Start!

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.991
Ugh.

00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:25.492
Guess we're stuck here.

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:26.627
Huh?

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:29.062
Haven't you given up yet?

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:31.932
I don't give up that easy.

00:00:31.932 --> 00:00:34.134
She hasn't seen the last of me.

00:00:34.668 --> 00:00:36.069
Hmm.

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:38.238
What is this place anyway?

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:50.984
Hey, Tails, you oughtta
get some sleep.

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:53.320
I don't have time to sleep.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.023
Not until I find out
the truth about Cosmo.

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.301
Where do you think
you're going, Sonic?

00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:08.569
You need your rest.

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:11.138
Don't worry, Amy. I'm okay.

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:13.040
Huh!

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.308
Hey!

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:16.476
I've got to follow him.

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:18.111
Uhh!

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.347
Huh?

00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:22.182
Hiya!

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:22.983
[Gasp]

00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:24.418
Not you!

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:26.453
Heh.

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:31.024
There's no communication
device anywhere.

00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:32.626
I told you so!

00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:33.927
Hang on a minute.

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:37.264
[Beeping]

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.335
Huh?

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:44.838
You got something?

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:46.773
There's some kind
of invisible signal

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:48.709
emanating from Cosmo's brain.

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:49.676
It's so microscopic,

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:51.845
normal radar wouldn't
pick up on it.

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:55.882
So Cosmo really has been beaming
information to the Metarex.

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:57.517
Can we stop it?

00:01:57.517 --> 00:01:59.152
I'm not so sure.

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:01.154
If we do, she'll never be the same.

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:03.790
Whatever it is, it's attached
to the part of Cosmo's brain

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.059
that controls her
sight and hearing.

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:09.596
If we remove it, she may
never see or hear again.

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:10.297
Hmm...

00:02:10.297 --> 00:02:11.832
Grr!

00:02:11.832 --> 00:02:13.934
That's a chance we'll have to take.

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:14.768
Grr!

00:02:14.768 --> 00:02:16.503
How can you say
something like that!

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:19.373
I'm not letting anyone hurt Cosmo!

00:02:19.373 --> 00:02:21.475
No one wants to hurt her!

00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:23.610
We just want to set her free!

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.247
And if she has to lose her
eyes and ears, then so be it!

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:29.616
There has to be another way!

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:32.519
We're on the same team, you guys!

00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:35.455
I'm not the bad guy here.

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:37.891
I just want what's
best for all of us.

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:39.259
Okay.

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:42.029
We've just gotta think
this through calmly.

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:44.931
I know this isn't
easy for you, Tails.

00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:48.201
And I wish we had another
choice, but we don't.

00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:49.403
Either we do this,

00:02:49.403 --> 00:02:52.639
or we sacrifice ourselves
to the will of Dark Oak.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.542
I think it's pretty clear
what we have to do.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.512
Go, go, go, go, go

00:02:58.512 --> 00:03:01.615
Gotta go fast

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:04.551
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.357
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:12.426
Got ourselves a situation

00:03:12.426 --> 00:03:14.461
Stuck in a new location

00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:18.065
Without any explanation

00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:20.133
No talk of relaxation

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:21.768
Don't, don't, don't

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:23.570
Don't blink, don't think

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.372
Just go, go, go, go

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:26.873
Go, go

00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:32.412
Sonic is on the run

00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:34.314
Sonic, he's number one

00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:38.018
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:03:38.018 --> 00:03:41.722
-<i>Gotta go fast</i>
-<i>Sonic</i>

00:03:41.722 --> 00:03:44.124
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:03:44.124 --> 00:03:46.026
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:03:46.026 --> 00:03:48.528
Sonic X

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:50.464
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:03:51.198 --> 00:03:53.300
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.267
Sonic X

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.723
I'll have you know, the only
reason I haven't tossed you out

00:04:02.723 --> 00:04:04.291
of this plane is
because I was hoping

00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:06.293
you could give me some information.

00:04:06.293 --> 00:04:07.461
ROUGE: About what?

00:04:07.461 --> 00:04:10.797
I want you to tell me everything
you know about Cosmo.

00:04:10.797 --> 00:04:13.267
What makes you think
I know anything?

00:04:13.267 --> 00:04:16.003
Hey, Pinkie, slow this
thing down, will ya?

00:04:16.003 --> 00:04:19.540
No. Not until you tell
me what you're up to.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.808
Why were you and
Shadow after Cosmo?

00:04:21.808 --> 00:04:24.411
The Metarex were using
your friend as a spy.

00:04:24.411 --> 00:04:27.214
I should think you guys
would be thanking us.

00:04:27.214 --> 00:04:29.883
But what do you and Shadow
have to do with it?

00:04:31.218 --> 00:04:34.054
Shouldn't you be keeping
your eyes on the skies?

00:04:34.054 --> 00:04:36.056
Hey, don't change the subject!

00:04:36.056 --> 00:04:37.224
Watch out!

00:04:37.224 --> 00:04:38.425
Ah!

00:04:39.393 --> 00:04:40.661
[Sigh]

00:04:42.596 --> 00:04:43.697
Aah!

00:04:47.968 --> 00:04:49.503
ROUGE: Oh, Knuckie!

00:04:49.503 --> 00:04:51.004
Yeah? What?

00:04:51.004 --> 00:04:53.974
Goodness, what a charming
"hello" that was.

00:04:53.974 --> 00:04:56.443
Well, well, if it
isn't Rouge the rat.

00:04:56.443 --> 00:04:58.045
You've got a lot of nerve.

00:04:58.045 --> 00:04:59.279
You think I'm gonna make nice...

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:02.216
He's going off. Here, talk to him.

00:05:02.216 --> 00:05:03.884
Knuckles, it's me.

00:05:03.884 --> 00:05:06.186
Rouge and I figured
out where we are.

00:05:06.186 --> 00:05:08.188
Oh, yeah?

00:05:08.188 --> 00:05:09.623
You won't believe this.

00:05:10.591 --> 00:05:14.561
It's their home planet...
Cosmo's and the Metarex.

00:05:20.601 --> 00:05:23.303
You are looking upon
Planet Green Gate.

00:05:23.971 --> 00:05:28.609
We lived here long ago, before
a terrible darkness befell us.

00:05:28.609 --> 00:05:30.611
Everything has been destroyed.

00:05:30.611 --> 00:05:33.313
All that is left
is long since dead.

00:05:33.313 --> 00:05:37.251
I have come to tell you our story
and that of the evil Metarex.

00:05:38.218 --> 00:05:39.186
[Grunting]

00:05:39.186 --> 00:05:43.123
Well, you know, you really
outdid yourself this time,

00:05:43.123 --> 00:05:45.993
trying to hurt a harmless
little kid like Cosmo.

00:05:45.993 --> 00:05:48.629
I just can't seem to
figure you out, Shadow.

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:50.697
You really are a mystery.

00:05:51.198 --> 00:05:52.132
Hmph!

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:54.201
[Grunt]

00:05:54.201 --> 00:05:56.670
You'd just better watch
your back, Shadow.

00:05:59.706 --> 00:06:01.308
Well, what's stopping you, Sonic?

00:06:01.308 --> 00:06:03.010
Here's your big chance.

00:06:03.844 --> 00:06:06.413
Nah, I'm not in the mood to fight.

00:06:06.413 --> 00:06:09.483
But when I am, you'll be
the first to know, pal.

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:13.487
Huh!

00:06:22.596 --> 00:06:25.299
We were once a thriving
civilization,

00:06:25.299 --> 00:06:28.001
but then came the time
of the Great Calamity.

00:06:30.737 --> 00:06:32.139
It was long ago.

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:34.074
A war began that soon threatened

00:06:34.074 --> 00:06:36.743
to spread to the far
reaches of the galaxy.

00:06:41.114 --> 00:06:45.452
[Crowd ruckus]

00:06:47.387 --> 00:06:48.355
Uhhh!

00:06:48.355 --> 00:06:49.890
I have to act quickly!

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.626
Perhaps the transformation
will last this time!

00:06:52.626 --> 00:06:53.727
Landar!

00:06:53.727 --> 00:06:57.597
[Roaring]

00:06:57.597 --> 00:07:01.968
[Growling]

00:07:03.704 --> 00:07:05.839
[Roaring]

00:07:11.978 --> 00:07:14.114
[Roaring]

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:24.725
[Whimpering]

00:07:33.734 --> 00:07:34.701
[Groan]

00:07:34.701 --> 00:07:35.702
Aah!

00:07:38.271 --> 00:07:43.744
[Crying]

00:07:46.413 --> 00:07:49.249
The citizens of our planet
are in grave danger.

00:07:49.249 --> 00:07:50.817
While the enemy is
getting stronger,

00:07:50.817 --> 00:07:52.719
we are losing more
soldiers by the minute.

00:07:52.719 --> 00:07:55.889
The evolutionary process
is unnaturally fast.

00:07:55.889 --> 00:07:57.924
It has yet to be perfected.

00:07:57.924 --> 00:07:59.526
Something must be done.

00:07:59.526 --> 00:08:02.129
We must find a way to make
the transformation last.

00:08:02.129 --> 00:08:04.998
We cannot continue to let
our men destroy themselves.

00:08:04.998 --> 00:08:07.567
My own husband perished
only yesterday,

00:08:07.567 --> 00:08:08.869
and unless something is done,

00:08:08.869 --> 00:08:11.772
I am afraid thousands more
will meet the same fate.

00:08:14.074 --> 00:08:16.009
It is time for us to leave here.

00:08:16.009 --> 00:08:18.545
Perhaps we will return
to our home one day,

00:08:18.545 --> 00:08:20.847
but now, it is too dangerous.

00:08:22.482 --> 00:08:23.984
What is that?

00:08:23.984 --> 00:08:25.919
It is a blessed amulet.

00:08:25.919 --> 00:08:27.854
It will protect us on our journey.

00:08:28.822 --> 00:08:29.890
Journey?

00:08:30.757 --> 00:08:32.192
How dare you?

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.229
You want us to simply
give in to the enemy?

00:08:36.229 --> 00:08:37.631
Never!

00:08:37.631 --> 00:08:38.632
Lucas!

00:08:38.632 --> 00:08:40.300
I won't do it.

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.403
I have never been a coward, and
I won't become one for you.

00:08:43.804 --> 00:08:46.139
You will do as I say.

00:08:46.139 --> 00:08:49.042
I have gone along with
you this far, Earthia.

00:08:49.042 --> 00:08:52.913
But I refuse to let those that have
fallen before me perish in vain!

00:08:53.346 --> 00:08:54.147
Ugh!

00:08:54.147 --> 00:08:55.982
If you won't respect my decision,

00:08:55.982 --> 00:08:58.218
you can stay behind and
fight the enemy yourself.

00:08:58.218 --> 00:08:59.186
Very well.

00:09:09.473 --> 00:09:13.910
Earthia, do you think we will ever
return here once the war is over?

00:09:15.212 --> 00:09:18.682
No one knows what the future will
hold for our planet, Starla.

00:09:18.682 --> 00:09:21.017
We will have to wait and see.

00:09:23.253 --> 00:09:25.021
Earthia, come quickly!

00:09:25.021 --> 00:09:28.024
Something is happening
to the trees outside!

00:09:28.024 --> 00:09:29.793
What do you mean?

00:09:36.766 --> 00:09:37.734
Lucas!

00:09:37.734 --> 00:09:39.870
Huh? Yes, Earthia?

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.571
[Panting] You must help.

00:09:41.571 --> 00:09:43.140
There is something happening.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.309
It's awful. Everything
outside is suddenly dying.

00:09:46.309 --> 00:09:47.511
[Gasp]

00:09:51.748 --> 00:09:53.049
What is that?

00:09:53.049 --> 00:09:55.018
It is the Planet Egg,

00:09:55.018 --> 00:09:56.753
the entire energy supply of our

00:09:56.753 --> 00:09:58.622
planet in crystallized form.

00:09:58.622 --> 00:10:00.657
In its powers, I have
discovered a way for the

00:10:00.657 --> 00:10:02.025
transformation to last...

00:10:02.025 --> 00:10:05.228
a way for us to fight
our enemy forever.

00:10:05.228 --> 00:10:07.063
Have you gone mad?

00:10:07.063 --> 00:10:08.498
Just the opposite.

00:10:08.498 --> 00:10:09.866
With such a thing as this,

00:10:09.866 --> 00:10:12.135
we will be more than mere beasts!

00:10:12.135 --> 00:10:14.804
We will rise up, and we
will claim our victory.

00:10:14.804 --> 00:10:16.139
Finally!

00:10:16.139 --> 00:10:19.075
Earthia, this is what
we've been waiting for!

00:10:19.576 --> 00:10:23.947
But, Lucas, our people have always
honored the natural world.

00:10:24.281 --> 00:10:25.849
How could you do it?

00:10:25.849 --> 00:10:28.618
[Crying]

00:10:28.618 --> 00:10:29.586
Hmm?

00:10:29.586 --> 00:10:30.554
Earthia?

00:10:32.088 --> 00:10:33.290
Ugh!

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:35.959
You! You have betrayed
your own people.

00:10:35.959 --> 00:10:38.061
You have destroyed
everything that was ours,

00:10:38.061 --> 00:10:39.796
faster than any enemy!

00:10:40.564 --> 00:10:42.699
You were the one who
wanted to leave here.

00:10:42.699 --> 00:10:44.067
I haven't betrayed anyone!

00:10:44.067 --> 00:10:45.302
You have!

00:10:45.302 --> 00:10:46.570
You're wrong!

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:50.674
We will crystallize the power of
every planet in the known galaxy.

00:10:50.674 --> 00:10:53.476
We will have the strength
of a thousand armies!

00:10:53.476 --> 00:10:55.045
You are mad.

00:10:55.045 --> 00:10:55.845
[Crying]

00:10:55.845 --> 00:10:57.547
Let go!

00:10:57.547 --> 00:10:59.749
We will lay waste to the enemy.

00:10:59.749 --> 00:11:03.720
And with our newfound power,
we will create a new order.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.689
No... Please...

00:11:05.689 --> 00:11:06.957
Stop!

00:11:06.957 --> 00:11:08.391
Grr.

00:11:13.663 --> 00:11:16.866
[Roaring]

00:11:17.601 --> 00:11:25.909
[Crowds screaming]

00:11:26.643 --> 00:11:30.947
Earthia, I'm afraid hundreds
of beasts are still resisting.

00:11:31.448 --> 00:11:33.650
We have no choice
but to destroy them.

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:34.651
[All Gasp]

00:11:36.119 --> 00:11:39.656
They will bring darkness upon the
galaxy if we do not stop them.

00:11:40.624 --> 00:11:45.262
May we be granted divine protection
as we travel to a more peaceful world.

00:11:53.536 --> 00:11:55.538
We are not yet finished.

00:11:55.538 --> 00:11:58.008
Our transformation is not complete.

00:11:58.008 --> 00:11:59.943
The final stages are upon us.

00:11:59.943 --> 00:12:04.180
Soon, we shall rule
through space and time.

00:12:09.019 --> 00:12:14.124
You tried to destroy us, Earthia,
but we are indestructible.

00:12:14.124 --> 00:12:18.194
We will live on, and all our
enemies shall bow before us.

00:12:18.194 --> 00:12:20.263
We will have our revenge.

00:12:21.865 --> 00:12:25.101
Only four of those who
remained here survived.

00:12:25.669 --> 00:12:29.539
In time, Lucas became the Metarex
leader known as Dark Oak.

00:12:29.539 --> 00:12:31.107
He and his fellow revolutionaries

00:12:31.107 --> 00:12:34.377
continue to cause chaos
throughout the galaxy.

00:12:35.445 --> 00:12:38.114
Please, do everything you can.

00:12:38.114 --> 00:12:40.083
They must be stopped.

00:12:40.083 --> 00:12:41.384
That explains a lot.

00:12:41.384 --> 00:12:41.951
Huh?

00:12:41.951 --> 00:12:42.686
Oh!

00:12:42.686 --> 00:12:43.953
Sonic!

00:12:44.621 --> 00:12:46.556
We've gotta stop these guys.

00:12:48.158 --> 00:12:51.027
Cosmo, you must be
awfully hungry by now.

00:12:51.027 --> 00:12:54.164
Why don't you let me make
you something to eat, okay?

00:12:54.164 --> 00:12:55.899
My mother taught me how to make

00:12:55.899 --> 00:12:58.034
the most delicious sugar cookies.

00:12:59.469 --> 00:13:00.970
Leave me alone.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:01.805
Cosmo!

00:13:01.805 --> 00:13:02.972
Chao!

00:13:04.374 --> 00:13:07.444
Please, you two, just go.

00:13:08.078 --> 00:13:11.214
Don't you know it's
dangerous to be around me?

00:13:11.214 --> 00:13:12.615
You're wrong!

00:13:12.615 --> 00:13:13.917
Chao chao chao chao chao chao!

00:13:13.917 --> 00:13:15.652
You're our friend, Cosmo.

00:13:15.652 --> 00:13:18.254
What they say...
it's just not true.

00:13:18.254 --> 00:13:19.689
It is!

00:13:20.223 --> 00:13:21.424
But how?

00:13:21.424 --> 00:13:23.460
I can't be anybody's friend,

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.829
not when I'm secretly
working for the enemy.

00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:27.430
Just stay away!

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:28.732
I'm no good anyway.

00:13:28.732 --> 00:13:31.267
Shadow should have
finished me off by now.

00:13:31.267 --> 00:13:34.771
No, please don't say that, Cosmo.

00:13:34.771 --> 00:13:36.072
We all love you...

00:13:36.072 --> 00:13:38.608
even if you are a
spy like they say.

00:13:38.608 --> 00:13:39.642
Huh?

00:13:39.642 --> 00:13:41.344
I'm sorry.

00:13:41.344 --> 00:13:42.479
Get out.

00:13:42.479 --> 00:13:44.247
Just leave me alone.

00:13:45.315 --> 00:13:46.816
Please don't cry.

00:13:47.717 --> 00:13:49.586
I said go!

00:13:49.586 --> 00:13:56.393
[Sobbing]

00:13:56.393 --> 00:13:57.160
Chao chao!

00:14:02.232 --> 00:14:03.299
[Gasp]

00:14:04.134 --> 00:14:05.568
I can hear them.

00:14:06.102 --> 00:14:10.407
I can hear them inside
my head... <i>Echoing</i>

00:14:12.275 --> 00:14:13.243
Hey there, Chris!

00:14:13.243 --> 00:14:14.778
You still up here working?

00:14:14.778 --> 00:14:16.780
Finally makin' some headway.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.782
This stuff is pretty complex.

00:14:18.782 --> 00:14:21.484
Well, if anyone can figure
it out, it's you, buddy.

00:14:21.851 --> 00:14:22.585
Hmm.

00:14:22.585 --> 00:14:26.322
Man, there sure is a lot of
data inside of this thing.

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:28.825
Anything interesting?

00:14:28.825 --> 00:14:31.728
Plenty. In fact, I'm
still downloading it all.

00:14:31.728 --> 00:14:33.396
There's a lot I
haven't figured out,

00:14:33.396 --> 00:14:35.398
but what I have is pretty amazing,

00:14:35.398 --> 00:14:37.133
like this stuff here.

00:14:37.133 --> 00:14:39.502
Remember the data Tails
and Cosmo collected

00:14:39.502 --> 00:14:41.805
from that underground
Metarex factory?

00:14:41.805 --> 00:14:45.475
Well, I was able to cross-reference
it, and here's what I foundâ

00:14:45.475 --> 00:14:48.745
It's some kind of plan to wipe out
flesh and blood creatures of all

00:14:48.745 --> 00:14:53.016
kinds until the whole galaxy is populated
only by trees and plant life.

00:14:53.716 --> 00:14:55.919
Plant life... there it is.

00:14:55.919 --> 00:14:58.021
There's the whole Cosmo connection.

00:14:58.555 --> 00:15:01.024
Why didn't we see
it back then, Sonic?

00:15:01.491 --> 00:15:04.894
How else could she have figured
out that Metarex language?

00:15:04.894 --> 00:15:07.530
Maybe we could have done something.

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:09.065
Maybe it would have
been different ifâ

00:15:09.065 --> 00:15:12.469
Dwelling on the past isn't
gonna make it any easier, pal.

00:15:12.469 --> 00:15:14.938
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

00:15:14.938 --> 00:15:17.607
I just don't want to see
anybody get hurt, that's all.

00:15:18.141 --> 00:15:19.142
Ah!

00:15:19.876 --> 00:15:20.777
Ah!

00:15:23.046 --> 00:15:25.515
Tails was so upset before.

00:15:25.515 --> 00:15:27.851
Poor guy's heart is breaking.

00:15:27.851 --> 00:15:31.387
Not to mention Cosmo...
Can't be easy for her.

00:15:31.387 --> 00:15:33.323
We'll get through it, pal.

00:15:33.323 --> 00:15:34.290
Huh?

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:36.226
We've been through worse before.

00:15:36.226 --> 00:15:38.394
And we made it through okay, right?

00:15:38.394 --> 00:15:39.329
Mm.

00:15:41.464 --> 00:15:42.799
SONIC: It's gonna be okay.

00:15:42.799 --> 00:15:46.669
One day all of this will
be over, I promise.

00:15:53.106 --> 00:15:54.540
TAILS: Where are you going?

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:55.508
[Gasp]

00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:58.811
Please, Tails.

00:15:58.811 --> 00:16:01.147
I'm leaving. You can't stop me.

00:16:01.147 --> 00:16:03.649
I don't understand where you'll go.

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:05.618
To fight Dark Oak.

00:16:06.252 --> 00:16:08.488
Though I'm not sure
what good it will do.

00:16:08.488 --> 00:16:10.423
You can't go alone, Cosmo.

00:16:10.423 --> 00:16:11.591
Yes, I can.

00:16:11.591 --> 00:16:13.626
You'll be much safer
when I'm not around.

00:16:13.626 --> 00:16:17.196
I can't stay here.
Don't you understand?

00:16:17.196 --> 00:16:19.832
They're using my
eyes to spy on you.

00:16:19.832 --> 00:16:21.834
They're listening through my ears.

00:16:21.834 --> 00:16:23.870
They're using me to betray you.

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:26.372
It's not your fault, Cosmo.

00:16:26.372 --> 00:16:28.307
I feel so lost.

00:16:28.307 --> 00:16:30.543
I just don't know what to do.

00:16:30.543 --> 00:16:31.711
It's okay.

00:16:31.711 --> 00:16:34.914
I feel like I don't even
know who I am anymore.

00:16:34.914 --> 00:16:37.417
You're my friend, that's who.

00:16:37.417 --> 00:16:40.319
I've done nothing but
bring you trouble,

00:16:40.887 --> 00:16:43.689
so how can you still call
me your friend, Tails?

00:16:45.691 --> 00:16:48.995
'Cause those Metarex can use your
eyes and ears all they want,

00:16:48.995 --> 00:16:51.130
but they can never have your heart.

00:16:53.066 --> 00:16:54.133
Hm?

00:16:54.133 --> 00:16:56.636
You're not leaving
without us, are you?

00:16:56.636 --> 00:16:57.637
Oh!

00:16:57.637 --> 00:17:00.940
If you're gonna fight Dark Oak,
we're gonna fight with you!

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:01.774
Chao chao!

00:17:01.774 --> 00:17:02.475
Me too!

00:17:02.475 --> 00:17:04.744
Those Meta-dopes might
need a knuckle sandwich.

00:17:04.744 --> 00:17:05.812
"Knuckle sandwich?"

00:17:05.812 --> 00:17:07.346
Gee, that was real clever.

00:17:07.346 --> 00:17:08.881
Who asked you?

00:17:08.881 --> 00:17:10.016
Really?

00:17:11.084 --> 00:17:15.421
We all talked it over together,
and we want to help our friend.

00:17:15.421 --> 00:17:18.157
See? It's just like I said, Cosmo.

00:17:18.157 --> 00:17:20.560
It doesn't matter
what the Metarex do.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.528
We all know that you're
really our friend.

00:17:22.528 --> 00:17:24.597
That's what matters.

00:17:25.565 --> 00:17:29.068
Thank you, Tails. Thank you all!

00:17:29.068 --> 00:17:33.372
[Crying]

00:17:33.372 --> 00:17:35.308
You're all fools.

00:17:35.308 --> 00:17:37.143
You maybe right.

00:17:37.143 --> 00:17:39.846
If being a fool means helping a
friend when they're in trouble

00:17:39.846 --> 00:17:43.349
instead of turning your back on
them, then that's what we are.

00:17:43.349 --> 00:17:45.251
You don't have to go, Shadow.

00:17:45.251 --> 00:17:48.221
Why don't you stick around
and help us defeat them?

00:17:48.221 --> 00:17:51.390
They may be using Cosmo,
but it's not her fault.

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:52.525
And who knows?

00:17:52.525 --> 00:17:55.161
Maybe we can use their
own weapon against them.

00:17:55.161 --> 00:17:56.596
Come on. What do you say?

00:17:56.596 --> 00:17:57.964
Will you stay?

00:17:58.798 --> 00:18:01.033
No matter what you say,
your friend Cosmo is a

00:18:01.033 --> 00:18:03.603
Metarex spy, and that's
all there is to it.

00:18:03.603 --> 00:18:05.238
It's not that simple.

00:18:05.238 --> 00:18:06.839
Uh!

00:18:06.839 --> 00:18:09.375
Shadow! Emergency!

00:18:09.375 --> 00:18:11.878
Hey, what's he doing here?

00:18:12.311 --> 00:18:14.814
Please help, Shadow.
I'm begging you!

00:18:14.814 --> 00:18:17.416
The Metarex have taken
Eggman prisoner!

00:18:17.416 --> 00:18:18.384
Huh!

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.256
How dare you treat us
like common criminals?

00:18:23.256 --> 00:18:25.124
There is nothing common about us!

00:18:25.124 --> 00:18:29.195
You are under arrest for stealing
top secret information.

00:18:29.195 --> 00:18:32.932
We have been watching you
for a very long time.

00:18:32.932 --> 00:18:35.501
How dare you have us
under surveillance?

00:18:35.501 --> 00:18:38.304
Yeah, we should arrest you
for spying and for stealing

00:18:38.304 --> 00:18:41.073
the doctor's brilliant
technological innovations.

00:18:41.073 --> 00:18:44.844
I'm afraid that would not be
possible, my jailbird friends.

00:18:45.411 --> 00:18:48.080
You would be best to just sit
tight and enjoy your stay.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.682
Come back here, you Meta-clown!

00:18:49.682 --> 00:18:52.251
You let us out of here!
I'm talking to you!

00:18:52.251 --> 00:18:53.085
Come back!

00:18:58.558 --> 00:19:01.727
Master, all preparations
have been completed.

00:19:01.727 --> 00:19:03.763
We are ready to move forward.

00:19:04.463 --> 00:19:06.799
[Sinister laughter]

00:19:07.333 --> 00:19:08.734
Master?

00:19:09.235 --> 00:19:10.503
[Sinister laughter]

00:19:10.503 --> 00:19:14.073
Well, Earthia, it seems
your daughter has decided

00:19:14.073 --> 00:19:16.842
to continue in her
mother's footsteps.

00:19:16.842 --> 00:19:20.713
But I'm afraid she is
just as misguided as you.

00:19:28.221 --> 00:19:30.389
All of the lights
have been gathered.

00:19:30.389 --> 00:19:32.325
The time has come.

00:19:32.325 --> 00:19:36.329
The forestation project
is about to begin.

00:19:36.329 --> 00:19:40.199
[Evil laughter]
