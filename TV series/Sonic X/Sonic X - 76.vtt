00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:01.667
Last time on Sonic X,

00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:04.203
Eggman contacted Sonic and
the gang with the news that

00:00:04.203 --> 00:00:07.840
the Metarex were on the move toward
galactic coordinates 0, 0, 0,

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.543
where something majorly
mysterious was about to happen.

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:13.179
The team launched a counterattack,
but the mighty Metarex

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.080
proved themselves indestructible.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.149
In the meantime, Shadow
and the Chaotix crew

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:18.617
crashed the Metarex mother ship in

00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:21.487
the hopes of destroying Dark
Oak and his creepy cohorts,

00:00:21.487 --> 00:00:23.622
while Chris went on a
mission to free Eggman.

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:26.225
Little did our friends know of
the extraordinary occurrence

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:27.726
that was about to take place-

00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:31.797
A catastrophic collision of space and
time not seen for a thousand years!

00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:35.501
It was time for the final transformation,
a strange and momentous event

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:37.403
that would alter
the galaxy forever.

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:38.771
Will Sonic save the day?

00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:41.774
Or get lost in a watery
wasteland never to return?

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:42.842
Stay tuned!

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.312
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:49.415
Gotta go fast

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:52.351
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.157
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:00:58.157 --> 00:01:00.226
Got ourselves a situation

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.261
Stuck in a new location

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:05.865
Without any explanation

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:07.900
No talk of relaxation

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.568
Don't, don't, don't

00:01:09.568 --> 00:01:11.370
Don't blink, don't think

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.172
Just go, go, go, go

00:01:13.172 --> 00:01:14.673
Go, go

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:20.212
Sonic is on the run

00:01:20.212 --> 00:01:22.114
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:22.114 --> 00:01:25.818
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:29.522
-<i>Gotta go fast</i>
-<i>Sonic</i>

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:31.924
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:31.924 --> 00:01:33.826
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:36.328
Sonic X

00:01:36.328 --> 00:01:38.264
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:41.066
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:42.101
Sonic X

00:01:47.236 --> 00:01:48.204
Aah!

00:01:48.805 --> 00:01:51.274
No! I have to go after him!

00:01:51.274 --> 00:01:52.442
No way.

00:01:52.442 --> 00:01:53.643
But he could be hurt.

00:01:53.643 --> 00:01:55.945
Acting crazy isn't gonna help any.

00:01:55.945 --> 00:01:57.880
Try to stay calm, Amy.

00:02:00.316 --> 00:02:03.252
But you don't understand.
Sonic needs me.

00:02:03.853 --> 00:02:04.854
Oh, Amy.

00:02:04.854 --> 00:02:07.457
What if Sonic really
is hurt this time?

00:02:07.457 --> 00:02:09.826
We have to get him
out of there somehow.

00:02:12.328 --> 00:02:13.763
Oh, Sonic.

00:02:13.763 --> 00:02:17.333
[Roaring]

00:02:26.476 --> 00:02:28.745
This doesn't look good, guys.

00:02:29.712 --> 00:02:32.615
Yeah. I just don't know
what to do, Tails.

00:02:34.283 --> 00:02:36.386
Don't worry. He's going to be okay.

00:02:36.386 --> 00:02:37.353
Huh?

00:02:37.887 --> 00:02:40.356
This amulet is a very special one.

00:02:40.356 --> 00:02:42.725
It belonged to my mother long ago.

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:46.095
Sometimes it shows me
things others cannot see.

00:02:46.095 --> 00:02:47.330
He'll be all right.

00:02:48.197 --> 00:02:49.098
Hm.

00:02:49.866 --> 00:02:50.833
Really?

00:02:50.833 --> 00:02:53.870
Well, sure. That guy
can survive anything.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.439
And if Sonic can survive,
then we can, too.

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:58.341
Isn't that right, Cosmo?

00:02:58.341 --> 00:02:59.375
Mm...

00:02:59.375 --> 00:03:00.343
[All gasp]

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.246
Eggman here. Do you read me?

00:03:03.246 --> 00:03:05.381
You won't believe
what's just happened.

00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:07.283
It appears my Egg Crimson

00:03:07.283 --> 00:03:10.386
has rather conveniently
collided with your Typhoon.

00:03:11.387 --> 00:03:19.929
[Roaring]

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:21.330
Uh-oh!

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.932
[All scream]

00:03:22.932 --> 00:03:24.467
That was close.

00:03:24.467 --> 00:03:26.002
VECTOR: You kids okay?

00:03:26.002 --> 00:03:28.337
Looks like Eggman's
up to something.

00:03:28.337 --> 00:03:29.572
A cowardly trick...

00:03:29.572 --> 00:03:31.507
Old Egghead landed
his ship on yours

00:03:31.507 --> 00:03:33.176
so he wouldn't have to fight alone.

00:03:33.176 --> 00:03:35.111
We don't want that
egghead on our ship.

00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:36.646
DR. EGGMAN: What else
would you suggest?

00:03:36.646 --> 00:03:39.849
That creepy colossus is
greening up the whole galaxy.

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:41.684
I should think you'd
be happy to team up

00:03:41.684 --> 00:03:43.586
against these botanical beasties.

00:03:43.586 --> 00:03:47.190
[Roaring]

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.259
If this forestation
farce continues,

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:52.261
my genius will no longer flourish.

00:03:52.261 --> 00:03:54.497
What a terrible loss
for evil science.

00:03:54.497 --> 00:03:56.099
How could they be so selfish?

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.400
Come on, everybody.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.204
Let's grab some really big gardening
shears and show 'em who's boss.

00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:07.877
[Roaring]

00:04:07.877 --> 00:04:12.248
EARTHIA: Cosmo, do not
fear. I am always with you.

00:04:12.248 --> 00:04:15.162
Through this amulet, I am
watching and guiding you

00:04:15.162 --> 00:04:16.664
to your destiny.

00:04:16.664 --> 00:04:19.567
Our planet may have been
destroyed long ago,

00:04:19.567 --> 00:04:21.468
but through you, my daughter,

00:04:21.468 --> 00:04:24.238
the spirit of our
people will live on.

00:04:24.238 --> 00:04:26.540
Look for the light at
the end of the darkness.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.043
It is there... in your heart.

00:04:29.944 --> 00:04:31.679
What are we all
standing around for?

00:04:31.679 --> 00:04:33.480
Shouldn't we be out there fighting?

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.316
That thing's a hundred feet tall!

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:37.217
What do you suggest, champ?

00:04:37.217 --> 00:04:39.453
Well, we have to do something.

00:04:39.453 --> 00:04:41.789
There's gotta be some
way we can break them...

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:43.157
something we haven't thought of.

00:04:43.157 --> 00:04:44.892
You got your secret
weapon right here.

00:04:44.892 --> 00:04:46.527
Sure, I may be small, but I'll-

00:04:46.527 --> 00:04:47.995
Put a cork in it, Charmy.

00:04:47.995 --> 00:04:50.898
Finding a weak spot in that
gargantuan green meanie

00:04:50.898 --> 00:04:52.833
out there isn't going to be easy.

00:04:52.833 --> 00:04:55.002
With the combined power
of the Chaos Emeralds,

00:04:55.002 --> 00:04:56.737
not to mention the Planet Eggs,

00:04:56.737 --> 00:05:00.040
that three-headed dino-boar's
a mighty powerful monster.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.009
What about the Master Emerald?

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:04.345
Hey, why didn't we
think of that before?

00:05:04.345 --> 00:05:05.980
ALL: Huh?

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.248
If we charge up the
Master Emerald enough,

00:05:08.248 --> 00:05:10.985
we might be able to cause
some kind of Chaos reaction.

00:05:10.985 --> 00:05:12.820
Well, it's worth a try.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.255
This just might be the
idea we're looking for.

00:05:15.255 --> 00:05:17.358
I gotta hand it to you, Knuckles.

00:05:17.358 --> 00:05:19.460
Let's get to work
on this right away.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.527
Thank you, Knuckles.

00:05:20.527 --> 00:05:21.395
Chao!

00:05:22.096 --> 00:05:23.030
Heh.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.366
Aw, it was no big deal.

00:05:25.366 --> 00:05:27.534
Not so fast, my little
space-keteers.

00:05:27.534 --> 00:05:29.770
What if Knuckles' brilliant
idea lays an egg?

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:30.938
Pardon the pun.

00:05:31.372 --> 00:05:32.940
What do you mean?

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.777
We are going up against a whole
lot of concentrated energy.

00:05:36.777 --> 00:05:39.680
Scientifically speaking, even
if we charge the Master Emerald

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.149
to its maximum capacity,
it still might not work.

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:43.217
So, what then?

00:05:43.217 --> 00:05:45.486
Guess you'll find out
soon enough, tiger.

00:05:45.486 --> 00:05:46.186
Doh!

00:05:46.186 --> 00:05:48.288
I say Knuckles' idea has to work,

00:05:48.288 --> 00:05:50.758
because it's our only hope
for getting Sonic back.

00:05:50.758 --> 00:05:53.694
And don't forget, you got the
team at Chaotix Detective Agency

00:05:53.694 --> 00:05:54.628
on your side!

00:05:54.628 --> 00:05:56.964
Yeah, in case the
whole thing goes bust.

00:05:56.964 --> 00:05:58.899
Hey, wait a minute...

00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:00.334
What if it <i>does</i> go bust?

00:06:00.334 --> 00:06:02.970
What if the Master Emerald needs
more energy than we've got?

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.304
I have an idea.

00:06:04.304 --> 00:06:06.306
You could use the Egg
Crimson as backup

00:06:06.306 --> 00:06:09.476
just in case you need a little
more, shall we say, juice.

00:06:09.476 --> 00:06:10.411
[Laughing]

00:06:10.411 --> 00:06:12.346
Good idea, Eggy.

00:06:13.213 --> 00:06:15.482
You know, this is
almost heartwarming,

00:06:15.482 --> 00:06:17.951
everybody working
together like this.

00:06:17.951 --> 00:06:19.520
Don't get carried away.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.889
[Giggling]

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:24.458
DARK OAK: Your time

00:06:41.008 --> 00:06:42.543
What do we do?

Hang on tight, Espio.

He's a slippery one.

00:07:32.846 --> 00:07:34.314
Yeah, and cranky, too.

00:07:34.314 --> 00:07:41.121
[Growling]

00:07:50.363 --> 00:07:53.733
Thousands of years ago, when Planet
Green Gate first came to be,

00:07:53.733 --> 00:07:55.802
they believed in peace and harmony.

00:07:55.802 --> 00:07:56.570
Hm?

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:59.472
Why did it all have to
come to this, Tails?

00:07:59.472 --> 00:08:00.540
Why?

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:04.844
[Grunting]

00:08:06.146 --> 00:08:09.716
Okay, you guys, the Power Cannon
is all set up and ready to go.

00:08:09.716 --> 00:08:12.619
We've hooked it up to the
Egg Crimson for backup.

00:08:12.619 --> 00:08:14.554
Glad we could be
of assistance, kid.

00:08:15.555 --> 00:08:18.458
But, uh... there may
be one slight problem.

00:08:18.992 --> 00:08:19.960
Huh?

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.830
How is it that you found yourself
in this dimension, Chris?

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.200
Well, I used the Master Emerald's
energy as a connector

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.436
to synchronize my
world with this one.

00:08:29.436 --> 00:08:30.937
And then I teleported.

00:08:30.937 --> 00:08:32.872
Sure, you did.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.710
You used the Master Emerald
as a connector, all right.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.246
But when you teleported,
you lost six years because

00:08:39.246 --> 00:08:41.348
of an inter-dimensional
warp string,

00:08:41.348 --> 00:08:44.084
hence that inconvenient-not
to mention embarrassing-

00:08:44.084 --> 00:08:47.320
shift from strapping young
man, back to annoying squirt.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.257
Those lost years were stored
as particle data inside the

00:08:50.257 --> 00:08:52.559
Master Emerald's energy
centers for safekeeping.

00:08:52.559 --> 00:08:56.763
Isn't it just astonishing how the
doctor knows absolutely everything?

00:08:56.763 --> 00:08:58.531
He is a genius with a capital Gene.

00:08:58.531 --> 00:09:00.600
So, you're really 18, huh?

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.469
Too bad you're a
total shrimpy wimp.

00:09:02.469 --> 00:09:04.137
Grr! Who are you calling shrimp?

00:09:04.137 --> 00:09:05.538
I'm not done.

00:09:05.538 --> 00:09:08.642
The bad news is that if we use
up a large portion of the

00:09:08.642 --> 00:09:11.978
Master Emerald's energy, you
just may be stuck here, junior.

00:09:11.978 --> 00:09:13.113
Huh...

00:09:13.113 --> 00:09:16.349
Your particle data may dissipate
within moments of charging.

00:09:16.349 --> 00:09:18.151
In turn, I'm afraid
it could take years

00:09:18.151 --> 00:09:20.587
to renew its current structure,

00:09:20.587 --> 00:09:23.890
which means you may never be
able to return to your world,

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:25.925
and even if you do,
your molecular structure

00:09:25.925 --> 00:09:28.595
could possibly be
permanently damaged.

00:09:29.062 --> 00:09:30.530
Oh, no.

00:09:51.851 --> 00:09:57.424
Sonic Power Cannon, backup
to Egg Crimson, and connect!

00:09:59.125 --> 00:10:01.961
If it means saving my
friends from danger,

00:10:01.961 --> 00:10:03.963
I'm willing to take the chance.

00:10:03.963 --> 00:10:06.099
You're really going through
with this, aren't you?

00:10:06.866 --> 00:10:09.769
I just have to believe I'll
see my folks again one day,

00:10:09.769 --> 00:10:12.105
and when I do, I want
them to be proud of me.

00:10:12.105 --> 00:10:13.073
Huh!

00:10:14.941 --> 00:10:18.078
I have to admit you are
not so bad after all, kid.

00:10:18.078 --> 00:10:18.712
[Laughing]

00:10:18.712 --> 00:10:21.414
Yeah, here I thought you were
just a sniveling little brat,

00:10:21.414 --> 00:10:23.616
but you are not sniveling at all.

00:10:23.616 --> 00:10:24.851
Sure, he ain't.

00:10:24.851 --> 00:10:27.520
Ya know, deep down, I always
knew you were an okay kid,

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.656
but these two bozos
wouldn't believe me.

00:10:29.656 --> 00:10:31.191
Who are you calling "bozo?"

00:10:31.191 --> 00:10:32.759
Hey, thanks a lot, you guys.

00:10:32.759 --> 00:10:34.627
I don't know what to say.

00:10:38.365 --> 00:10:41.134
I'm not gonna let the
Metarex win this.

00:10:41.601 --> 00:10:43.636
You're pretty tough, kid.

00:10:44.237 --> 00:10:46.106
All right, Tails, it
looks like the backup

00:10:46.106 --> 00:10:48.208
with Egg Crimson
has been completed.

00:10:48.208 --> 00:10:50.677
I've reprogrammed the Power
Cannon so it'll receive a

00:10:50.677 --> 00:10:53.613
sustained charge from all sources.

00:10:53.613 --> 00:10:55.148
We're ready.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:00.086
The seven Chaos Emeralds
are the servers.

00:11:00.086 --> 00:11:02.848
Chaos is the power
enriched by the heart.

00:11:02.848 --> 00:11:06.736
Chaos is the power

00:11:13.166 --> 00:11:14.934

Aaah!

00:11:35.622 --> 00:11:37.657
It's time!

00:11:37.657 --> 00:11:40.226
The controller serves
to unify the Chaos.

00:11:40.226 --> 00:11:43.163
Come on, Master
Emerald, come through.

00:11:43.163 --> 00:11:44.831
You're our last chance.

00:11:44.831 --> 00:11:46.733
If this doesn't work,
the Metarex will win,

00:11:46.733 --> 00:11:49.068
and I will not let that happen.

00:11:53.139 --> 00:11:55.074
Come on, Master Emerald,
you can do this.

00:11:55.074 --> 00:11:56.042
I know you can.

00:11:56.042 --> 00:11:57.143
You're strong enough!

00:11:57.143 --> 00:11:58.511
Don't let us down!

00:11:58.511 --> 00:12:02.115
Master Emerald, give
us all your power!

00:12:02.649 --> 00:12:04.617
It's almost at full power.

00:12:04.617 --> 00:12:07.420
We'll wait a couple more seconds,
and then we'll reroute the energy.

None can coexist with nature,
