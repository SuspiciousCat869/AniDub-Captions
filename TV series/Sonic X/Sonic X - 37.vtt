00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.768
Last time on Sonic X,

00:00:01.768 --> 00:00:04.872
Shadow transported Chris
to Eggman's space base,

00:00:04.872 --> 00:00:07.307
where Chris learned about
a secret orbiting colony

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:09.109
built by Eggman's grandfather,

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:11.411
the brilliant Professor Gerald Robotnik.

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:14.948
Eggman unveiled the Eclipse
Cannon, his ultimate weapon,

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:17.784
and warned that he'd use it
unless the entire population

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:20.053
surrendered to the Eggman Empire.

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:22.189
What are Shadow's mysterious motives?

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.258
Can Chris' friends find and rescue him?

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:27.561
Will Eggman use the Eclipse Cannon
and destroy the whole planet?

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:30.130
Find out next on Sonic X!

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.765
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:34.835
Gotta go fast

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.771
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:43.610
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.646
Got ourselves a situation

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:47.714
Stuck in a new location

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:51.318
Without any explanation

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.387
No talk of relaxation

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.022
Don't, don't, don't

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:56.823
Don't blink, don't think

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:58.625
Just go, go, go, go

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.127
Go, go

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:05.666
Sonic is on the run

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.534
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:11.271
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:14.942
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:17.377
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:19.279
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:21.782
Sonic X

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:23.684
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.520
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.554
Sonic X

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.545
Excuse me! I'm Scarlet
Garcia from SSTV News.

00:02:02.446 --> 00:02:03.413
Reporter?

00:02:03.413 --> 00:02:05.349
I have nothing to say to you.

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:07.284
I just want to be left alone.

00:02:07.985 --> 00:02:09.920
We don't want to trouble you, sir.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.990
We'd simply like to ask
you a couple of questions.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.860
Can you tell us what happened on
Space Colony ARK 50 years ago?

00:02:18.762 --> 00:02:20.063
Nothing happened.

00:02:20.063 --> 00:02:22.466
I understand your reluctance
to talk about it, sir.

00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:23.867
But you were there when it occurred,

00:02:23.867 --> 00:02:26.003
and we need to find out all that we can.

00:02:26.003 --> 00:02:28.271
Please, sir. I need to know.

00:02:28.271 --> 00:02:31.708
You don't have any idea what you're
getting involved in, young lady.

00:02:31.708 --> 00:02:34.845
Just leave it alone before
you stir up trouble.

00:02:43.253 --> 00:02:45.756
Looks like your boys really
goofed, didn't they, Doc?

00:02:45.756 --> 00:02:47.357
None of your business!

00:02:47.357 --> 00:02:50.160
Fine. Let's launch the counterattack.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.696
How about giving me the
password for the colony?

00:02:53.463 --> 00:02:58.035
M-A-R-I-A. Maria.

00:02:58.035 --> 00:02:59.603
That's the magic word.

00:02:59.603 --> 00:03:02.873
Meanwhile, I'll be standing
by a crazy gadget.

00:03:03.206 --> 00:03:04.174
Huh.

00:03:04.174 --> 00:03:07.077
Fooling that old fool ought to be a snap.

00:03:07.077 --> 00:03:09.046
All right. Let's start hacking.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.349
Maria. M-A-R-I-A.

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.317
Let's see what pops up here.

00:03:14.317 --> 00:03:15.886
Come on, come on.

00:03:17.954 --> 00:03:19.156
Ah, here we are.

00:03:19.156 --> 00:03:21.491
Project Shadow. Top secret!

00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:22.993
Sounds exciting!

00:03:22.993 --> 00:03:25.862
The Ultimate Creature Development Project.

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.765
Sure sounds juicy to me.

00:03:28.765 --> 00:03:30.067
Shadow?

00:03:30.067 --> 00:03:31.435
Sealed off?

00:03:31.435 --> 00:03:32.736
But how?

00:03:33.537 --> 00:03:36.540
If that's true, then who's he?

00:03:42.646 --> 00:03:44.247
Here comes your friend.

00:03:44.247 --> 00:03:45.382
Huh?

00:03:45.382 --> 00:03:46.817
You mean Sonic?

00:03:46.817 --> 00:03:48.752
He'd be a fool to challenge me.

00:03:48.752 --> 00:03:50.654
You're the fool, not Sonic!

00:03:50.654 --> 00:03:52.589
You'll see I'm right.

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:56.460
This is one battle your friend cannot win.

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:09.306
What you're investigating is much
more dangerous than you know.

00:04:09.306 --> 00:04:12.442
I won't answer any of your
questions, and that's that.

00:04:12.442 --> 00:04:15.579
Please, sir. You've just got
to tell us what happened.

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.314
You're the only survivor!

00:04:17.314 --> 00:04:20.217
Everyone else was... lost.

00:04:20.217 --> 00:04:22.452
Even my father.

00:04:22.452 --> 00:04:23.487
Hm...

00:04:23.487 --> 00:04:24.788
I'm begging you!

00:04:24.788 --> 00:04:25.755
Please tell us!

00:04:25.755 --> 00:04:28.492
You owe it to the memory of
all those innocent people!

00:04:28.992 --> 00:04:30.393
Scarlet...

00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:37.434
I'm sorry.

00:04:37.434 --> 00:04:40.203
That wasn't very professional of me.

00:04:40.203 --> 00:04:42.272
You don't have to apologize.

00:04:42.272 --> 00:04:44.741
It must bring up a lot of
painful memories for you.

00:04:44.741 --> 00:04:45.342
Oh!

00:04:45.342 --> 00:04:46.276
Huh?

00:04:47.677 --> 00:04:49.212
Don't panic.

00:04:49.212 --> 00:04:51.548
Get to the car as fast as you can.

00:04:51.548 --> 00:04:52.315
Why?

00:04:52.315 --> 00:04:53.517
Hurry!

00:04:54.718 --> 00:04:56.653
She's getting away!

00:04:56.653 --> 00:04:58.822
Hyaaaaaaaa!

00:04:58.822 --> 00:05:00.490
Oof!

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.491
[Grunt]

00:05:01.491 --> 00:05:03.293
Who's next? Hm?

00:05:03.293 --> 00:05:05.228
What do you want from me?

00:05:05.228 --> 00:05:06.196
Scarlet!

00:05:06.196 --> 00:05:07.230
[Grunt]

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.198
Let go!

00:05:08.198 --> 00:05:09.166
Get in the car!

00:05:09.166 --> 00:05:10.133
[Gasp]

00:05:10.133 --> 00:05:11.101
Oh!

00:05:11.101 --> 00:05:12.068
Woah!

00:05:12.068 --> 00:05:13.036
[Groan] Oof.

00:05:13.036 --> 00:05:14.004
[Gasp]

00:05:14.971 --> 00:05:16.206
Thank you!

00:05:17.374 --> 00:05:18.341
[Gasp]

00:05:18.341 --> 00:05:19.776
This way!

00:05:26.983 --> 00:05:28.752
I don't see them anywhere.

00:05:30.053 --> 00:05:31.688
I don't know how to thank you.

00:05:32.222 --> 00:05:33.623
That was nice work.

00:05:33.623 --> 00:05:36.526
I used to be able to handle myself okay.

00:05:36.526 --> 00:05:40.297
But... that was a long time ago.

00:05:50.407 --> 00:05:52.876
I'll bet they're watching us in there.

00:05:52.876 --> 00:05:55.245
You just take it slow and steady.

00:05:58.615 --> 00:06:00.984
[Sparkling]

00:06:00.984 --> 00:06:01.818
Huh?

00:06:02.552 --> 00:06:03.520
Hurry it up!

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.821
[Gasp]

00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:06.990
Knuckles! What's the matter with you?

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.092
The Master Emerald. It's nearby!

00:06:09.092 --> 00:06:10.193
I can feel it!

00:06:10.193 --> 00:06:12.562
Knuckles! Let go of the wheel!

00:06:21.371 --> 00:06:22.606
[Scream]

00:06:22.606 --> 00:06:24.274
Here comes my breakfast.

00:06:24.274 --> 00:06:26.243
All right. Calm down, will ya?

00:06:26.243 --> 00:06:28.478
We're going to the same place anyway.

00:06:28.478 --> 00:06:30.847
Master Emerald, here I come!

00:06:35.752 --> 00:06:37.387
Intruder alert.

00:06:37.387 --> 00:06:38.755
Sector M-14.

00:06:38.755 --> 00:06:40.023
Intruder alert.

00:06:40.023 --> 00:06:41.758
Sector M-14.

00:06:42.392 --> 00:06:44.394
I wonder who that could be.

00:06:54.137 --> 00:06:57.040
[Sparkling]

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.041
[Grunt]

00:06:58.041 --> 00:06:59.976
[Grunt] [Panting]

00:07:00.977 --> 00:07:01.878
Oof!

00:07:03.413 --> 00:07:06.983
Uh-uh. This area's off-limits, slugger.

00:07:06.983 --> 00:07:08.985
I want that Master Emerald!

00:07:08.985 --> 00:07:10.854
Sorry, guy.

00:07:11.521 --> 00:07:16.426
[Sounds of fighting]

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.296
Now, that's no way to treat a lady.

00:07:19.296 --> 00:07:21.364
Didn't ya ever learn any manners?

00:07:21.364 --> 00:07:24.034
I've got manners, but you're no lady.

00:07:24.034 --> 00:07:25.535
[Grunt] Oof!

00:07:25.535 --> 00:07:26.770
Aah!

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:27.404
Oof!

00:07:27.404 --> 00:07:28.038
Aah!

00:07:28.038 --> 00:07:32.008
[Scream]

00:07:33.209 --> 00:07:34.177
Oof!

00:07:35.111 --> 00:07:36.179
Huh?

00:07:36.746 --> 00:07:38.248
I've got ya!

00:07:43.453 --> 00:07:45.789
Ugh! Get your hands off me!

00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:47.190
Hey! If it weren't for me,

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.792
you would've fallen on your head!

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:52.095
Ha! Were you really trying to save me?

00:07:52.095 --> 00:07:54.397
Or were you just trying to be fresh?

00:07:54.397 --> 00:07:55.899
I wonder.

00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:58.435
You're crazy! What do you mean fresh?

00:07:58.435 --> 00:08:00.337
Talk about ungrateful!

00:08:00.337 --> 00:08:01.604
Whatever.

00:08:01.604 --> 00:08:03.773
Have it your way if it makes you happy.

00:08:03.773 --> 00:08:04.474
Wha-?

00:08:04.474 --> 00:08:05.942
See ya!

00:08:06.943 --> 00:08:08.845
What about the Emerald?

00:08:08.845 --> 00:08:10.080
Emerald?

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.247
Take it.

00:08:11.247 --> 00:08:12.615
It's yours.

00:08:12.615 --> 00:08:15.285
What kind of game are you playing, anyway?

00:08:15.285 --> 00:08:16.152
[Grunt]

00:08:16.152 --> 00:08:18.421
Even for a bat, you're batty.

00:08:18.421 --> 00:08:19.622
[Grunt]

00:08:21.758 --> 00:08:25.829
[Sparkling]

00:08:25.829 --> 00:08:28.398
That's my cue to get out of here.

00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:35.071
Sure is a lonely place.

00:08:35.572 --> 00:08:37.407
I suspect that no one has been here

00:08:37.407 --> 00:08:40.076
since the accident occurred 50 years ago.

00:08:40.076 --> 00:08:42.045
We have a big problem.

00:08:42.045 --> 00:08:44.948
How do we destroy that
weapon when we find it?

00:08:44.948 --> 00:08:47.117
Here! Why not give this a try?

00:08:47.717 --> 00:08:49.052
A Chaos Emerald?

00:08:49.052 --> 00:08:50.787
Well, it's not a real one.

00:08:50.787 --> 00:08:53.123
I made a copy to help power the X Tornado.

00:08:53.123 --> 00:08:56.025
It doesn't have the same power
as a real Chaos Emerald,

00:08:56.025 --> 00:08:57.927
but if we put it in with a real one,

00:08:57.927 --> 00:09:01.097
it might cause some kind of reaction
and mess up the whole system.

00:09:01.097 --> 00:09:02.065
Okay!

00:09:02.065 --> 00:09:03.800
If this little baby does the trick,

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.102
it'll be goodbye, Eclipse Cannon!

00:09:09.272 --> 00:09:11.241
[Evil laugh]

00:09:11.241 --> 00:09:12.208
Huh?

00:09:12.208 --> 00:09:13.343
Oh!

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:15.245
[All screaming]

00:09:15.712 --> 00:09:17.747
Hey! What's that?

00:09:18.715 --> 00:09:19.649
Amy!

00:09:20.116 --> 00:09:21.084
Ugh!

00:09:21.084 --> 00:09:23.586
Let's shed some light on things!

00:09:24.621 --> 00:09:27.524
I will set your friend
free, under one condition.

00:09:27.524 --> 00:09:29.259
Give me the Emerald,

00:09:29.259 --> 00:09:31.394
and I'll give you the girl.

00:09:31.394 --> 00:09:33.096
Let's see.

00:09:33.096 --> 00:09:35.165
Give me a minute to think it over.

00:09:35.165 --> 00:09:37.400
What do you mean, think it over?

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.904
Well, perhaps this might
make you think faster!

00:09:40.904 --> 00:09:42.906
Sonic!

00:09:43.873 --> 00:09:45.241
It's a deal!

00:09:45.241 --> 00:09:48.144
Place the Emerald in the
center of that circle.

00:09:48.912 --> 00:09:51.047
Guess it's just like that old saying,

00:09:51.047 --> 00:09:53.016
"Easy come, easy go."

00:09:53.016 --> 00:09:54.250
Oh, well.

00:09:57.987 --> 00:10:01.491
Prepare to be blown into
space, my little blue friend!

00:10:02.192 --> 00:10:03.426
No, wait!

00:10:03.426 --> 00:10:05.862
What if I promise to give
you a real Chaos Emerald?

00:10:05.862 --> 00:10:06.830
What's that?

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:09.833
You mean to tell me that Chaos
Emerald is a counterfeit?

00:10:09.833 --> 00:10:10.733
Uh...

00:10:10.733 --> 00:10:14.471
I shall make Sonic pay for your
deception, you crafty creep!

00:10:14.471 --> 00:10:17.173
You let Sonic go right now!

00:10:17.941 --> 00:10:19.976
Hey! It's okay.

00:10:19.976 --> 00:10:21.544
Sonic...

00:10:23.213 --> 00:10:25.515
You're in charge, pal. All right?

00:10:25.515 --> 00:10:27.684
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

00:10:27.684 --> 00:10:31.054
Now, Sonic. It's time to say goodbye!

00:10:31.054 --> 00:10:31.988
[Grunt]

00:10:32.455 --> 00:10:33.890
Sonic, no!

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:34.858
[Screams]

00:10:45.735 --> 00:10:47.170
He's gone.

00:10:49.138 --> 00:10:51.374
[Explosion]

00:10:51.374 --> 00:10:54.377
Sonic!!!

00:10:54.377 --> 00:10:55.812
[Explosion]

00:11:00.884 --> 00:11:02.986
Your friend could not save himself.

00:11:02.986 --> 00:11:05.722
Huh? You mean Sonic was in there?

00:11:07.257 --> 00:11:09.158
Yes, I'm afraid he was.

00:11:09.158 --> 00:11:12.896
Perhaps Sonic was not the great
hero you thought him to be.

00:11:12.896 --> 00:11:14.330
You're wrong!

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.332
It can't be true!

00:11:16.332 --> 00:11:17.600
Sonic!

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.568
[Panting]

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.721
He's gone.

00:11:29.721 --> 00:11:32.524
[Crying]

00:11:32.524 --> 00:11:34.960
Quit your blubbering, and
hand over that Emerald!

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:39.097
I can't sit here all day waiting
for your crocodile tears to dry!

00:11:39.097 --> 00:11:40.866
I won't let you down, Sonic.

00:11:40.866 --> 00:11:42.701
I'll never give him what he wants.

00:11:42.701 --> 00:11:44.069
Huh?

00:11:44.903 --> 00:11:46.405
I'll be strong!

00:11:46.405 --> 00:11:49.274
I won't let myself run away this time!

00:11:49.274 --> 00:11:50.843
Amy! Mr. Tanaka!

00:11:50.843 --> 00:11:52.177
Stay out of the way!

00:11:52.177 --> 00:11:53.145
Amy.

00:11:53.145 --> 00:11:54.713
Follow me!

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.381
[Panting]

00:11:56.381 --> 00:11:59.084
You've tried my patience for far too long.

00:11:59.084 --> 00:12:00.686
You asked for it!

00:12:00.686 --> 00:12:02.721
[Lasers firing]

00:12:02.721 --> 00:12:03.622
Aah!

00:12:03.622 --> 00:12:04.756
Ah!

00:12:04.756 --> 00:12:08.427
Gr... I'll make you pay for that!

00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:11.930
Our mission seemed pretty
straightforward at the time.

00:12:12.931 --> 00:12:17.202
They ordered us to close the facility
because of some sort of accident.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.538
Go on.

00:12:20.038 --> 00:12:23.442
A couple of us knew they weren't
telling the whole story.

00:12:24.042 --> 00:12:26.845
But none of us had the guts to speak up.

00:12:26.845 --> 00:12:30.449
We just did our jobs and went
up to space, like we were told.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:39.591
None of us knew what to expect.

00:12:39.591 --> 00:12:42.494
By that time, we'd heard all
sorts of rumors about the ARK.

00:12:42.494 --> 00:12:46.031
Some said they were experimenting
with the concept of eternal life.

00:12:46.031 --> 00:12:49.902
Others said they had created something
called the Ultimate Creature.

00:12:49.902 --> 00:12:50.869
[Yell]

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:52.571
Huh?

00:12:53.372 --> 00:12:54.306
Stop!

00:12:55.574 --> 00:12:58.076
[Panting]

00:13:03.916 --> 00:13:05.317
It's the creature!

00:13:05.317 --> 00:13:07.252
She's setting it free!

00:13:08.387 --> 00:13:09.621
[Lasers firing]

00:13:12.224 --> 00:13:13.358
Freeze!

00:13:13.358 --> 00:13:14.893
[Gasp]

00:13:14.893 --> 00:13:17.029
Take your hand off that lever!

00:13:19.097 --> 00:13:21.099
I'm not fooling around here!

00:13:21.099 --> 00:13:22.401
Hmph!

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.005
She was so young.

00:13:27.005 --> 00:13:29.007
I'll never forget her face.

00:13:29.007 --> 00:13:31.643
[Sobbing]

00:13:33.312 --> 00:13:35.147
We sealed off the area,

00:13:35.147 --> 00:13:37.516
and they took her away.

00:13:37.516 --> 00:13:40.419
The mission ended, and we all went home.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.222
But wasn't there any kind of investigation?

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.926
The official report called
it an "unfortunate accident,"

00:13:47.926 --> 00:13:49.861
and we were all sworn to secrecy.

00:13:49.861 --> 00:13:52.431
But I know that it wasn't an accident,

00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:54.700
and nobody can tell me otherwise!

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.035
I volunteered for that force as a young man,

00:13:57.035 --> 00:14:00.305
because I wanted to give
back to the country I loved!

00:14:00.305 --> 00:14:01.673
But then...

00:14:01.673 --> 00:14:02.841
But then they...

00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:04.776
[Crying]

00:14:06.812 --> 00:14:08.547
I understand now.

00:14:08.547 --> 00:14:10.048
Thank you.

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:16.254
He's wrong! Sonic wasn't in there!

00:14:16.254 --> 00:14:17.556
He couldn't be!

00:14:17.556 --> 00:14:19.925
It's not true!

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:25.897
Huh?

00:14:34.706 --> 00:14:35.507
Oof!

00:14:35.507 --> 00:14:36.074
Uh...

00:14:36.074 --> 00:14:37.376
Sonic!

00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:38.810
[Panting]

00:14:39.344 --> 00:14:41.279
Hey! Are you all right?

00:14:42.247 --> 00:14:44.182
[Groaning]

00:14:44.182 --> 00:14:45.784
I'm okay.

00:14:46.118 --> 00:14:48.053
I wanna try somethin'.

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:54.426
[Sparkling]

00:14:54.426 --> 00:14:55.394
Now...

00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:57.429
let's see if this works.

00:14:57.429 --> 00:14:59.364
Chaos Control!

00:15:04.202 --> 00:15:07.072
This may be a fake, but it works!

00:15:07.906 --> 00:15:10.308
You gonna tell me what's going on, or not?

00:15:10.308 --> 00:15:11.276
Yeah, I will!

00:15:11.276 --> 00:15:12.511
But first things first!

00:15:12.511 --> 00:15:15.547
I need you to keep an eye
on Tails and the others.

00:15:15.547 --> 00:15:16.915
Okay.

00:15:16.915 --> 00:15:19.184
Great! And while you're doing that,

00:15:19.184 --> 00:15:22.154
I'm gonna put this guy to the ultimate test.

00:15:24.923 --> 00:15:27.826
Now don't you worry your
pretty little head, Topaz.

00:15:27.826 --> 00:15:30.929
I'm copying all the data as we speak.

00:15:30.929 --> 00:15:33.832
Just be sure that you get
every bit of information.

00:15:33.832 --> 00:15:35.767
Don't leave anything behind, Rouge.

00:15:37.469 --> 00:15:39.438
We need to know all we can.

00:15:39.938 --> 00:15:41.339
[Beeping]

00:15:44.876 --> 00:15:46.344
I got it all, honey.

00:15:46.344 --> 00:15:48.280
And it looks like there's plenty of it.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.183
Even that dope Eggman doesn't
know the whole story.

00:15:51.183 --> 00:15:53.418
And it's quite a story!

00:15:53.418 --> 00:15:55.487
You'd better hurry up and get out of there.

00:15:55.487 --> 00:15:57.055
Have you got the Emeralds?

00:15:57.055 --> 00:15:59.424
We can analyze the data when you get back.

00:15:59.424 --> 00:16:00.559
After that, we can-[Stomp]

00:16:02.027 --> 00:16:06.098
I suggest you keep your hands
off those Chaos Emeralds.

00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:08.533
We wouldn't want them to
fall into the wrong hands,

00:16:08.533 --> 00:16:11.269
now would we... Agent Rouge!

00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:13.238
Have you been spying on me?

00:16:13.238 --> 00:16:15.207
Aren't you the naughty little boy.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.210
You've been a government spy all this time!

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:19.544
Uh-huh!

00:16:19.544 --> 00:16:22.080
Now that I have my hands on
this hot little disk here,

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.248
I think I'll make my exit,

00:16:23.248 --> 00:16:24.316
if you don't mind.

00:16:24.316 --> 00:16:26.084
I do mind, you phony!

00:16:27.018 --> 00:16:29.321
That's pretty funny, coming from you.

00:16:30.689 --> 00:16:32.324
What do you mean by that?

00:16:32.324 --> 00:16:36.294
[Lasers firing]

00:16:36.294 --> 00:16:37.796
This is for Sonic!

00:16:37.796 --> 00:16:39.431
[Lasers firing]

00:16:39.431 --> 00:16:41.299

[All screaming]

00:16:43.835 --> 00:16:44.803
Oof!

00:16:50.275 --> 00:16:52.010
[Coughing]

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.812
You're not hurt, are you, Tails?

00:16:53.812 --> 00:16:56.081
It worked! I did it!

00:16:57.048 --> 00:16:58.016
Huh?

00:16:59.417 --> 00:17:02.087
Oh, no! Give that back to me!

00:17:03.054 --> 00:17:04.523
[Evil laugh]

00:17:08.936 --> 00:17:11.272
According to this, the body
of the original creature

00:17:11.272 --> 00:17:13.207
was sealed off 50 years ago.

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:17.344
Yes, that's right.

00:17:17.344 --> 00:17:19.280
But that was the prototype.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.049
I was the very first creature
created after that one.

00:17:22.049 --> 00:17:23.417
Ah! But it says here

00:17:23.417 --> 00:17:25.452
there were <i>two</i> capsules
ejected from the ARK

00:17:25.452 --> 00:17:27.154
when the facility was shut down.

00:17:27.154 --> 00:17:30.024
Apparently, neither of them was ever found.

00:17:30.024 --> 00:17:32.426
And if those two capsules were never found,

00:17:32.426 --> 00:17:34.361
then how did you end up on Prison Island?

00:17:35.329 --> 00:17:36.530
I wonder!

00:17:37.498 --> 00:17:40.401
I have a feeling neither
of us is who we say we are.

00:17:41.135 --> 00:17:42.369
[Beep beep]

00:17:42.369 --> 00:17:43.304
Huh?

00:17:43.304 --> 00:17:44.705
Good news, Shadow!

00:17:44.705 --> 00:17:46.774
I've gotten ahold of the Chaos Emeralds!

00:17:46.774 --> 00:17:47.541
And?

00:17:47.541 --> 00:17:51.812
It appears one of our enemies is headed
straight for the Eclipse Cannon!

00:17:51.812 --> 00:17:53.314
We have no time to waste.

00:17:53.314 --> 00:17:55.249
Prepare for takeoff immediately!

00:17:57.518 --> 00:17:58.485
Come back!

00:17:58.485 --> 00:18:01.255
Don't you understand you're
not the <i>real</i> Shadow?

00:18:03.257 --> 00:18:06.827
Everything in your memory
is as unreal as you are!

00:18:08.662 --> 00:18:11.765
If it is true that all of
my memories are not my own,

00:18:11.765 --> 00:18:14.001
they are still all that I have.

00:18:14.001 --> 00:18:15.970
I will do what I must.

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.504
I promised her.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.741
Hmph!

00:18:21.809 --> 00:18:23.243
[Panting] Huh?

00:18:23.243 --> 00:18:24.645
[Groan] Him again!

00:18:24.645 --> 00:18:26.580
He must be going after Sonic.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.515
Then Sonic's all right!

00:18:28.515 --> 00:18:29.316
What?

00:18:29.316 --> 00:18:31.218
[Panting]

00:18:32.186 --> 00:18:33.454
Sonic...

00:18:33.454 --> 00:18:34.788
He's okay!

00:18:34.788 --> 00:18:37.291
Master Chris, it is you!

00:18:37.291 --> 00:18:39.226
Hi, Mr. Tanaka!

00:18:39.226 --> 00:18:39.693
Ohhh....

00:18:39.693 --> 00:18:40.294
Oof!

00:18:40.294 --> 00:18:43.297
Master Chris! Are you alright?

00:18:43.297 --> 00:18:45.799
Yeah, except I can't really breathe...

00:18:45.799 --> 00:18:46.800
[Chuckling]

00:18:52.339 --> 00:18:53.974
SHADOW: What a surprise.

00:18:53.974 --> 00:18:54.508
Huh?

00:18:54.508 --> 00:18:58.145
I could've sworn I saw you blown
to bits just a short time ago.

00:19:00.848 --> 00:19:03.717
Well, I guess I'm a lot tougher than I look!

00:19:04.251 --> 00:19:06.320
In fact, it's thanks to you I'm okay!

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.621
I see.

00:19:07.621 --> 00:19:10.758
You caused Chaos Control with
that phony Emerald there.

00:19:11.291 --> 00:19:12.259
Yup!

00:19:12.259 --> 00:19:13.694
I gotta run!

00:19:16.397 --> 00:19:20.100
I'm afraid I can't let you get away
from me that easily, my friend.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.003
Now, I demand to know who you are!

00:19:23.404 --> 00:19:24.304
Who, me?

00:19:24.304 --> 00:19:26.807
I'm just a guy with a need for speed!

00:19:26.807 --> 00:19:28.609
They call me Sonic the Hedgehog!

00:19:28.609 --> 00:19:29.576
Ah, yes.

00:19:29.576 --> 00:19:33.447
I can well understand your
love of speed, Sonic.

00:19:33.447 --> 00:19:37.384
But now your high-speed
adventure must come to an end!

00:19:39.787 --> 00:19:43.991
Eclipse Cannon is nearly ready
to launch again, Dr. Eggman.

00:19:43.991 --> 00:19:46.427
I will release the safety device.

00:19:46.427 --> 00:19:48.529
[Evil laughter]

00:19:49.096 --> 00:19:50.898
Chaos Spear!

00:19:51.331 --> 00:19:52.199
[Grunt]

00:19:56.603 --> 00:19:58.405
Chaos Spear!

00:19:59.239 --> 00:20:00.040
[Grunt]

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.582
What's he trying to do, barbecue me?

00:20:12.453 --> 00:20:14.388
It's the Eclipse Cannon!

00:20:14.388 --> 00:20:16.123
Sonic must have done that!

00:20:16.123 --> 00:20:19.693
Now all we have to do is get that
Chaos Emerald back from Eggman!

00:20:19.693 --> 00:20:21.195
Then we'll be in the clear!

00:20:21.662 --> 00:20:24.798
Doctor! The Eclipse Cannon
has been badly damaged!

00:20:24.798 --> 00:20:27.101
What does Shadow think he's doing?

00:20:27.101 --> 00:20:28.102
Oh, no!

00:20:28.102 --> 00:20:29.703
The gun battery has been hit!

00:20:29.703 --> 00:20:30.604
Hm?

00:20:30.604 --> 00:20:31.905
Grr!

00:20:31.905 --> 00:20:33.474
Well, fire it anyway!

00:20:36.844 --> 00:20:38.112
[Grunt]

00:20:38.112 --> 00:20:40.447
Eclipse Cannon... fire!

00:20:54.461 --> 00:20:55.429
Huh?

00:20:56.096 --> 00:20:57.164
Huh??

00:20:57.364 --> 00:20:58.265
Huh?!

00:20:58.265 --> 00:21:01.535
[Beeping]

00:21:04.805 --> 00:21:06.273
Grandpa!

00:21:06.273 --> 00:21:10.677
The countdown marking my final
revenge on this world has begun!

00:21:10.677 --> 00:21:14.047
In just a few minutes, you will be destroyed!

00:21:14.047 --> 00:21:15.916
Soon, Space Colony ARK

00:21:15.916 --> 00:21:17.684
will hurtle through the atmosphere

00:21:17.684 --> 00:21:21.655
and crash into this planet
with cataclysmic force!
