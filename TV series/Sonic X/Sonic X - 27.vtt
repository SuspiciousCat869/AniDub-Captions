00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.935
<i>Last time on "Sonic</i> X"...

00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:03.036
After tricking Knuckles

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:04.938
into giving him
the 6 Chaos Emeralds,

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:06.807
Dr. Eggman kidnapped Chris,

00:00:06.907 --> 00:00:08.709
holding him hostage
on the Egg Fort II.

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:10.978
Soon Dr. Eggman's robot Lucky
returned

00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:12.412
with the seventh emerald.

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:14.481
But just as Eggman
was about to grab it,

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:16.083
Sonic showed up
to thwart his plan.

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:18.085
Determined to get
the last emerald,

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:21.421
Eggman transformed the Egg Fort
II into the Egg-sterminator,

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:24.391
a gargantuan super-bot powered
by the Chaos Emeralds.

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:26.527
The Egg-sterminator
captured Sonic,

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.896
but Chris broke free
and grabbed the emeralds,

00:00:28.996 --> 00:00:31.465
only to find himself rescued
by Rouge the Bat.

00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:34.935
But Rouge dropped the emeralds
into the sea.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:36.770
All seven emeralds
came together,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.039
and it was Chaos Control time.

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:41.975
Were Sonic and his friends
sent back home?

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.244
Are Tails and Chuck with them?

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:46.980
Or did something even more
unbelievable happen?

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.916
There's only one way
to find out.

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:50.183
Stay tuned.

00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:51.919
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.487

Got ourselves a situation

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:07.868
Stuck in a new location

00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:11.405
Without any explanation

00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:13.540
No talk of relaxation

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.175
Don't, don't, don't

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:16.944
Don't blink, don't think

00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:18.779
Just go, go, go, go

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:20.247
Go, go

00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:25.786
Sonic is on the run

00:01:25.886 --> 00:01:27.688
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:31.425
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

Ribbit!
Ribbit!

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.527
I think you're trying to
tell me something.

00:02:35.462 --> 00:02:37.864
Wow!
What's this?

00:02:37.965 --> 00:02:39.900
Sure is pretty.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.369
Somebody must have dropped it.

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:45.372
Finders, keepers, right, pal?

00:02:45.472 --> 00:02:47.874
Ribbit!
Ribbit!

00:02:47.975 --> 00:02:50.377

What's the matter, little buddy?

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.146
Hey, am I seeing things?

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:27.914
You're growing a tail.

00:03:28.015 --> 00:03:29.916
Ribbit.

00:03:31.485 --> 00:03:33.820
Ribbit!

00:03:38.825 --> 00:03:41.828
It's been six months,
and I still don't understand

00:03:41.928 --> 00:03:44.264
what happened when the Chaos
Emeralds came together.

00:03:44.364 --> 00:03:46.800
Sonic and his friends thought
Chaos Control would send them

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.035
back to their planet,

00:03:48.135 --> 00:03:50.570
but a piece of their planet
was sent here instead.

00:03:50.671 --> 00:03:53.407
Still, our citizens appear to be
taking it all in stride,

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.008
Mr. President.

00:03:55.108 --> 00:03:57.344
In fact, the plans
to turn Mystic Ruins

00:03:57.477 --> 00:04:01.014
into a tourist attraction are to
be a great boost to the economy.

00:04:01.148 --> 00:04:04.851
Maybe so, but one thing
still has me worried.

00:04:04.951 --> 00:04:06.019
Dr. Eggman.

00:04:06.153 --> 00:04:08.055
I wouldn't worry about that.

00:04:08.155 --> 00:04:10.157
We've got intelligence teams
all over the globe

00:04:10.257 --> 00:04:11.792
tracking his whereabouts.

00:04:11.892 --> 00:04:14.661
Plans are also underway
to install a new network

00:04:14.761 --> 00:04:16.430
of surveillance satellites.

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.564
Really?

00:04:17.664 --> 00:04:19.599
But no matter how you spin it,

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.334
you still haven't managed
to catch him.

00:04:21.435 --> 00:04:23.570
- Rouge, please!
- It's true, isn't it?

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.939
Who cares about agents
and satellites?

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:29.042
Why don't we all admit
he's just too smart for us?

00:04:29.176 --> 00:04:30.577
Rouge is right.

00:04:30.677 --> 00:04:32.846
In all this time
since Chaos Control happened,

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.548
we haven't heard a peep
out of him.

00:04:34.681 --> 00:04:35.816
Isn't it obvious?

00:04:35.916 --> 00:04:38.618
He's taking a little break
to plot his next move.

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:39.586
That must be it.

00:04:39.686 --> 00:04:42.856
I well understand your
frustration, Mr. President.

00:04:42.956 --> 00:04:44.591
We won't let you down, sir.

00:04:44.691 --> 00:04:47.094
See that you don't.

00:04:48.061 --> 00:04:49.930
Oh, and one more thing.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.833
How are Sonic and his little
friends doing anyway?

00:04:54.334 --> 00:04:55.469
Here, sir.

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:59.039
From these pictures, you can see
they're all doing fine.

00:05:06.346 --> 00:05:07.814
Delectable as always.

00:05:07.914 --> 00:05:09.382
I don't know how you do it,
Ella.

00:05:09.483 --> 00:05:13.386
And you never will.
It's my secret recipe.

00:05:13.487 --> 00:05:16.456
Would you like some toast with
your scrambled eggs, Ms. Cream?

00:05:16.556 --> 00:05:18.391
Yes, please,
and some for Cheese.

00:05:18.492 --> 00:05:21.228
Chao!

00:05:21.828 --> 00:05:23.964
[Laughs]

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:28.435
I was wondering if you have to
stay after school

00:05:28.535 --> 00:05:29.903
for anything special today?

00:05:30.003 --> 00:05:33.140
Not today, Grandpa.
Why do you ask?

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.443
How would you like to come
to Mystic Ruin with me?

00:05:36.576 --> 00:05:38.812
I've been meaning to test
a new aircraft model

00:05:38.912 --> 00:05:41.114
at Tails' workshop and thought
you might like to join me.

00:05:41.214 --> 00:05:44.084
Sorry, but I'm meeting my mom
downtown after school.

00:05:44.184 --> 00:05:45.852
Isn't that right, Cream?

00:05:45.952 --> 00:05:47.254
Yeah, it's true.

00:05:47.354 --> 00:05:49.122
She wants to show us something.

00:05:49.222 --> 00:05:50.624
Ahh!

00:05:50.724 --> 00:05:53.326
It'll be good for you to spend
some time together.

00:05:53.426 --> 00:05:57.497
Yeah, we've got a lot
to catch up on.

00:05:57.597 --> 00:05:59.232
I better get going.

00:05:59.332 --> 00:06:00.767
So long, Master Chris.

00:06:00.867 --> 00:06:03.236
You study hard, now.
We'll see you at dinnertime.

00:06:03.336 --> 00:06:04.971
Okay!

00:06:09.776 --> 00:06:12.112
I know you're out there, Sonic.

00:06:12.212 --> 00:06:14.815
I sure hope you're okay.

00:06:20.854 --> 00:06:22.222
[Whistles]

00:06:30.297 --> 00:06:31.565
Not long ago,

00:06:31.665 --> 00:06:34.835
this tranquil spot was
the center of a raging battle.

00:06:34.935 --> 00:06:36.903
Today the sea is calm
and peaceful,

00:06:37.003 --> 00:06:38.939
and there is no sign
of the disturbance

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:41.141
that took place six months ago.

00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:43.510
[Thinking] It's no fun
being all by myself.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.645
Nobody to talk to.

00:06:46.112 --> 00:06:47.614
[Sighs]

00:06:47.747 --> 00:06:51.418
It was so great having
my friends with me.

00:06:52.452 --> 00:06:54.487
It was all so exciting.

00:06:54.588 --> 00:06:57.157
Every day was like
a new adventure.

00:06:57.257 --> 00:07:00.861
And even when Sonic made me mad,
which was most of the time,

00:07:00.994 --> 00:07:03.230
I always felt safe around him.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.599
But all that
was before Sonic had to go

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:08.435
and disappear like that
without a trace.

00:07:11.338 --> 00:07:16.710
Sonic, where are you?!

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.211
Hey, keep it down!

00:07:18.345 --> 00:07:20.280
I ain't afraid to call
the authorities!

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.115
Sorry!

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:27.487
Why should I worry?

00:07:27.587 --> 00:07:29.122
Sonic will come back for me.

00:07:29.222 --> 00:07:31.157
I know he will.

00:07:35.195 --> 00:07:37.130
Officials are still unsure

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.366
as to the whereabouts
of Dr. Eggman.

00:07:39.466 --> 00:07:42.769
His location still remains
a mystery.

DR. EGGMAN: Activate
the main power surge now!

Let's have a bit
of target practice.

00:08:28.448 --> 00:08:31.518
[Laughs]
Not too shabby, I'd say.

00:08:31.618 --> 00:08:34.521
Your new robots are working
perfectly, Doctor.

00:08:34.621 --> 00:08:35.722
Who would have thought?

Ha-ha!

00:08:45.732 --> 00:08:48.201
I've really outdone myself
this time.

00:08:48.301 --> 00:08:51.137
Have you ever seen such
exquisitely evil creatures?

00:08:51.237 --> 00:08:54.140
I feel like a proud papa.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.111
You, my pets, are the first
of my new "E" Series robots.

You are programmed to receive
orders only from me.

00:09:01.247 --> 00:09:03.883
And now it is time
for the roll call.

00:09:03.984 --> 00:09:07.754
First up, E-101, Beta.

00:09:09.689 --> 00:09:12.592
E-102, Gamma.

00:09:19.933 --> 00:09:22.635
As far as the names go,
it's all Greek to me.

00:09:22.736 --> 00:09:25.405
Now to create a bit of chaos.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.997
Ahh, my sleekly designed,
brand-spanking-new,

00:09:51.097 --> 00:09:55.402
multifunctional flying fortress
handles like a dream.

00:09:57.103 --> 00:09:59.005
All right, Egg Carrier.

[Laughs]

00:10:01.241 --> 00:10:03.209
Blast off!

00:10:08.615 --> 00:10:09.983
I'm back.

00:10:10.083 --> 00:10:14.521
And this time nothing
will stand in my way.

00:10:31.027 --> 00:10:32.462
Do you like it?

00:10:32.562 --> 00:10:35.932
Sure, I like it.
Where did you find it?

00:10:36.032 --> 00:10:38.835
I saw it in a jewelry shop,
and I just had to have it.

00:10:38.969 --> 00:10:40.837
But it doesn't match
any of my outfits.

00:10:40.937 --> 00:10:42.405
Here.
It's yours.

00:10:42.505 --> 00:10:44.407
That's awfully generous.

00:10:44.507 --> 00:10:46.576
It would look perfect
with your coloring.

00:10:46.676 --> 00:10:48.912
- We could sure use it.
- Chao! Chao!

00:10:49.012 --> 00:10:50.113
It's settled then.

00:10:50.213 --> 00:10:53.817
Now if only we could get you out
of that dreadful bunny costume

00:10:53.917 --> 00:10:54.985
and into a smart suit.

00:10:55.085 --> 00:10:56.152
What?

00:10:56.252 --> 00:10:59.022
But, Mom, that's not a costume.
Cream is a...

[Cellphone rings]

00:11:00.757 --> 00:11:02.125
Hi!

00:11:02.225 --> 00:11:03.293
Right now?

00:11:03.393 --> 00:11:06.162
Fine, I'll be there.
Wait for me.

00:11:06.262 --> 00:11:09.733
Oh, Mommy hates to rush off,
but there's trouble on the set.

00:11:09.833 --> 00:11:12.135
Apparently, they have to
recast the dog.

00:11:12.235 --> 00:11:15.171
It's okay.
We'll do it another time.

00:11:15.271 --> 00:11:18.041
Mommy loves you!

00:11:20.276 --> 00:11:23.980
- Goodbye, sweetheart.
- Thank you very much!

00:11:25.949 --> 00:11:28.351
Chris, it's so pretty.

00:11:28.451 --> 00:11:30.353
I can't believe it was
in a jewelry store.

00:11:30.453 --> 00:11:32.589
Let's take it home
and show Sonic.

00:11:32.689 --> 00:11:35.091
- Okay.
- Chao! Chao!

00:11:35.191 --> 00:11:37.594
Ribbit!

00:11:37.727 --> 00:11:39.095

00:11:43.633 --> 00:11:44.601
Cheese!

00:11:44.701 --> 00:11:46.236
Are you okay?

00:11:46.369 --> 00:11:48.405
Hey, what's this?

00:11:48.538 --> 00:11:51.508
It looks like a frog,
but it's got a tail.

00:11:51.608 --> 00:11:53.343
Hey, Froggy!

[All shouting]

00:12:04.487 --> 00:12:06.356
- Ribbit!
- Come here, Froggy!

Ohh!
Please don't run away!

00:12:11.961 --> 00:12:14.164
My buddy!

00:12:15.832 --> 00:12:16.900
Sorry, mister.

00:12:17.033 --> 00:12:18.668
Your frog friend got tangled up

00:12:18.802 --> 00:12:20.804
with our little Chao friend.

00:12:21.971 --> 00:12:24.607
You look like
you're kind of lost.

00:12:25.408 --> 00:12:26.376
Huh?

00:12:28.178 --> 00:12:29.979
[Giggles]

00:12:32.015 --> 00:12:34.084
[Both sigh]

00:12:34.184 --> 00:12:35.618
Let's try this again.

00:12:35.718 --> 00:12:37.654
So your name is Big,

00:12:37.754 --> 00:12:39.989
and you came here
with your friend Froggy.

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:41.691
Is that what you're saying?

00:12:41.791 --> 00:12:42.926
Hmm?

00:12:43.026 --> 00:12:44.527
Mm-hmm.

00:12:46.362 --> 00:12:48.031
Told you we'd get
to the bottom of this.

00:12:48.131 --> 00:12:50.266
But there's just one thing.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.801
- Oh?
- Oh?

00:12:51.901 --> 00:12:54.270
That isn't Froggy!

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:55.939
[Both groan]

00:12:56.072 --> 00:12:57.207
He's gone.

00:12:57.307 --> 00:13:01.010
Poor Froggy.
What if I never find him?

00:13:01.111 --> 00:13:02.245
[Crying]

00:13:02.345 --> 00:13:05.215
Don't worry, Big.
You'll find Froggy again.

00:13:05.315 --> 00:13:06.683
We'll help you.

00:13:06.783 --> 00:13:09.219
Would you like us
to help you find him?

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.789
That would be nice.

00:13:12.889 --> 00:13:14.924
Froggy!

00:13:15.024 --> 00:13:16.392
Froggy!

00:13:16.493 --> 00:13:18.695
Where are you?

00:13:18.828 --> 00:13:20.563

Froggy?

00:13:29.472 --> 00:13:32.208
We've been out here looking
for hours.

00:13:32.308 --> 00:13:35.879
Hey, are you out here,
little buddy?!

00:13:35.979 --> 00:13:39.115
- [Leaves rustling]
- Is that you, Froggy?

00:13:42.719 --> 00:13:45.221
I don't think that's him.

00:13:45.321 --> 00:13:47.557
That looks like the same stuff
Froggy swallowed.

00:13:47.657 --> 00:13:49.192
You've seen this before?

00:13:49.292 --> 00:13:53.096
I saw him drink it,
and then Froggy grew a tail.

00:13:57.767 --> 00:13:59.435
Chao! Chao, chao!

00:13:59.536 --> 00:14:00.637

Don't move.

00:14:07.877 --> 00:14:10.113
Just keep calm.

while it's not looking.

- Okay. Come on!

didn't you?

[Screaming]

00:15:30.727 --> 00:15:34.197
I see you have a brain, pal,
so you better use it.

Sonic!

00:15:35.798 --> 00:15:37.634
Hey, buddy, good to see you.

00:15:37.734 --> 00:15:39.702
Sonic, behind you!

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:51.147
Careful, Sonic!
Whatever it is, it's dangerous!

00:16:06.129 --> 00:16:07.764

Can't take the heat, huh?

I do hope you'll all forgive me

00:16:21.177 --> 00:16:22.879
for dropping in unannounced
this way,

00:16:22.979 --> 00:16:25.882
but I simply couldn't miss
out on all the excitement.

00:16:25.982 --> 00:16:27.617
Look who's back in town.

00:16:27.717 --> 00:16:30.253
Yes, I took a 6-month
Chaos Control break,

00:16:30.353 --> 00:16:32.789
but now I'm rested
and ready to rumble.

00:16:32.889 --> 00:16:34.090
Go away, Eggman.

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.459
Haven't you caused
enough trouble?

00:16:36.559 --> 00:16:38.728
One can never cause
enough trouble, my dear,

00:16:38.828 --> 00:16:40.863
as you'll soon see.

Here, Chaos.
Have a little snack.

doesn't he?

[Laughs]

00:17:05.502 --> 00:17:08.905
You see, Sonic, this new
shape-shifting form of chaos

00:17:09.005 --> 00:17:12.208
gains more and more power with
each Chaos Emerald I feed it.

00:17:12.308 --> 00:17:13.309
Chaos?

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:14.444
That's right.

00:17:14.577 --> 00:17:16.813
This charming creature
is made of pure chaos,

00:17:16.946 --> 00:17:18.715
and he's under my control.

00:17:18.848 --> 00:17:22.218
Soon the day will come when
I have all 7 Chaos Emeralds,

00:17:22.318 --> 00:17:25.588
and when that happens,
we'll be unstoppable.

00:17:28.625 --> 00:17:30.493
Back off, pal!

00:17:30.593 --> 00:17:32.529
[Laughs]
Sorry, Sonic.

00:17:32.629 --> 00:17:34.964
It only takes orders from me.

00:17:35.065 --> 00:17:36.533
Now get 'em!

00:17:36.633 --> 00:17:38.535
Not so fast!

00:17:38.635 --> 00:17:40.203
Knuckles!

00:17:40.303 --> 00:17:44.707
All right, Eggman, what did you
do with the Master Emerald?

00:17:44.808 --> 00:17:47.811
Knuckles, did something happen
to the Master Emerald?

00:17:47.944 --> 00:17:50.113
Yeah, you might say that.

00:17:50.246 --> 00:17:52.649
Sonic, what are you doing here?

00:17:52.749 --> 00:17:54.717
I might ask you the same thing.

00:17:54.851 --> 00:17:56.753
I'm here to talk to Eggman.

00:17:56.853 --> 00:17:59.622
I got a couple of pressing
questions only he can answer.

00:17:59.722 --> 00:18:01.491
I would love to help you,
Knuckles,

00:18:01.591 --> 00:18:04.127
but right now it's feeding time.

00:18:04.227 --> 00:18:05.628
A Chaos Emerald!

00:18:05.728 --> 00:18:09.132
He has such a healthy appetite.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.968
It just keeps getting bigger.

00:18:12.068 --> 00:18:13.837
Look out!

00:18:42.265 --> 00:18:45.568
It's some kind of strange form
of pure chaos that gets bigger

00:18:45.668 --> 00:18:48.838
every time Dr. Eggman gives it
a Chaos Emerald.

00:18:54.611 --> 00:18:57.981
That's right.
Trash everything!

00:19:04.821 --> 00:19:05.722
Aah!

[Laughs evilly]

00:19:36.352 --> 00:19:37.787
He's shocking, isn't he?

00:19:37.887 --> 00:19:41.257
And that's what he's like
with only two measly emeralds.

00:19:41.357 --> 00:19:43.927
He doesn't scare me.

00:19:44.027 --> 00:19:45.962
Yeah, me neither.

00:19:48.565 --> 00:19:49.866
Look out!

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.669
You're finished.

00:19:58.174 --> 00:19:59.242

Chao! Chao! Chao!

00:20:37.947 --> 00:20:40.917
Think you beat me, eh?
Don't be so sure.

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:43.686
I've got more chaos
where that came from.

00:20:43.786 --> 00:20:47.290
We'll handle anything.
Just bring it on!

00:20:48.658 --> 00:20:52.795
You guys,
I've got a bad feeling.

00:20:52.895 --> 00:20:54.364
Me too.

00:20:54.464 --> 00:20:56.799
What if that chaos creature
gets stronger?

00:20:56.899 --> 00:20:57.900
Oh!

00:20:58.001 --> 00:21:00.203
Chao!

00:21:10.246 --> 00:21:12.348
We'll see.
