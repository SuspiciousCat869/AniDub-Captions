00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:05.638
Christopher went to Sonic's world!

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:08.341
Well, we have to bring
him back. Right now!

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:12.312
I don't think we should try to
operate his machine, Mrs. Thorndyke.

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:14.447
Only Chris understands
how it works.

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.482
I can't risk tampering
with it, Linsey.

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:18.351
If I damage it in any way,

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:20.453
Chris might be trapped
in Sonic's world forever.

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:22.855
But we can't just leave him there!

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:25.325
We have to trust our son.

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:26.025
But—

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:28.227
Chris knows how to
take care of himself.

00:00:28.227 --> 00:00:31.998
And you know, it's never wise
to underestimate a Thorndyke.

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:35.902
[Sigh]

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:43.810
I'm sure Chris will try to communicate
with us, Mrs. Thorndyke.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.411
We'll stay here at the
lab and let you know

00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:47.547
right away if we hear from him.

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:49.749
Thank you, Helen. Please do.

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:53.486
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:56.589
Gotta go fast

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.525
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:01.794 --> 00:01:05.365
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:07.367
Got ourselves a situation

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:09.435
Stuck in a new location

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:13.039
Without any explanation

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.108
No talk of relaxation

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:16.743
Don't, don't, don't

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:18.544
Don't blink, don't think

00:01:18.544 --> 00:01:20.346
Just go, go, go, go

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:21.848
Go, go

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:27.387
Sonic is on the run

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:29.288
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:29.288 --> 00:01:32.992
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:36.696
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:39.098
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:41.000
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.503
Sonic X

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:45.438
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:48.241
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:49.275
Sonic X

00:01:56.017 --> 00:01:58.953
CREAM: You detected one
of the Chaos Emeralds?

00:01:58.953 --> 00:02:00.588
AMY: Are you sure
about this, Knuckles?

00:02:00.588 --> 00:02:02.557
Yes. There's no doubt about it.

00:02:02.557 --> 00:02:04.525
I was in the engine room
a few minutes ago,

00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:07.061
and I saw the Master Emerald
reacting to something.

00:02:09.998 --> 00:02:12.066
It must have been an Emerald.

00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:14.535
Check for a planet nearby.

00:02:14.535 --> 00:02:15.970
Let's see.

00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:22.076
There's one!

00:02:22.076 --> 00:02:23.411
That's Planet Secco.

00:02:23.411 --> 00:02:27.215
And according to my galactic
guidebook, it's dry as a bone.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.821
Tails, we're gonna land on Planet
Secco and find that Emerald!

00:02:33.821 --> 00:02:35.356
Let's go!

00:02:35.356 --> 00:02:37.658
I'm supposed to give the orders.

00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:38.693
Just do it.

00:02:50.638 --> 00:02:52.140
CHRIS: According to the scopes,

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.075
there's a lot of
water on this world.

00:02:54.075 --> 00:02:56.444
SONIC: Oh, no! We can't land here!

00:02:56.444 --> 00:02:58.346
There's gotta be some
kind of mistake!

00:02:58.346 --> 00:02:59.647
Tough luck, Sonic.

00:02:59.647 --> 00:03:01.582
[Chuckling]

00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:15.596
TAILS: Splashdown!

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:33.614
You must have made
a wrong turn, Tails.

00:03:33.614 --> 00:03:35.883
The guidebook says
this planet's dry.

00:03:35.883 --> 00:03:37.485
Don't blame me, Sonic.

00:03:37.485 --> 00:03:41.355
Sounds like your galactic
guidebook's seriously out of date.

00:03:41.355 --> 00:03:43.658
There's way too much water here!

00:03:43.658 --> 00:03:45.026
I hate water.

00:03:45.026 --> 00:03:46.727
CHRIS: Don't sweat it, Sonic.

00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:50.598
I have a way for you to stay dry
even when you're underwater.

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.402
You're not afraid of
submarines, are you?

00:03:54.402 --> 00:03:55.670
Heh, heh...

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.138
Launch the subs!

00:04:05.146 --> 00:04:07.181
Aaaah!

00:04:15.056 --> 00:04:17.024
[Feeble groaning]

00:04:17.024 --> 00:04:20.361
Uh-oh. Sonic's looking
pretty seasick.

00:04:20.361 --> 00:04:23.498
Lucky for me we're riding
in separate compartments.

00:04:28.436 --> 00:04:31.038
Aah! Oh, no!

00:04:31.572 --> 00:04:36.410
Wh-wh-wh-wh-whoa!

00:04:42.083 --> 00:04:45.153
Are you sure the Chaos
Emerald's somewhere nearby?

00:04:45.153 --> 00:04:46.954
I couldn't be surer.

00:04:46.954 --> 00:04:49.624
What makes you so certain
we'll find it here, Knuckles?

00:04:49.624 --> 00:04:53.594
Because I've got a natural
knack for finding things.

00:04:53.594 --> 00:04:54.562
Oh.

00:04:55.596 --> 00:04:57.131
I'll show ya.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.536
[Grunting]

00:05:03.037 --> 00:05:10.111
[Grunting with effort]

00:05:14.582 --> 00:05:16.951
Why don't we dig for
the Chaos Emerald, too?

00:05:16.951 --> 00:05:18.152
Ahh!

00:05:18.953 --> 00:05:21.155
[Grunting with effort]

00:05:21.155 --> 00:05:25.660
[Humming]

00:05:28.162 --> 00:05:29.330
Oh!

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.098
Hmm?

00:05:31.098 --> 00:05:33.034
This is gonna be a long day.

00:05:34.435 --> 00:05:38.005
You don't think Sonic and Chris ran
into some kind of trouble, do you?

00:05:38.005 --> 00:05:39.941
Wouldn't be surprised.

00:05:44.212 --> 00:05:46.414
[Coughing]

00:05:46.414 --> 00:05:47.515
Sorry.

00:05:48.482 --> 00:05:50.618
Where are we?

00:05:56.657 --> 00:05:57.625
Hey, look!

00:05:57.625 --> 00:05:58.693
Huh?

00:06:06.701 --> 00:06:07.935
[Groaning]

00:06:07.935 --> 00:06:10.104
Sonic, come on.

00:06:10.104 --> 00:06:11.672
You're safe now.

00:06:11.672 --> 00:06:12.273
Huh?

00:06:12.273 --> 00:06:13.174
Aah!

00:06:16.677 --> 00:06:17.645
They're Metarex.

00:06:17.645 --> 00:06:21.515
Yeah, and whoever sent them here
designed them especially for the water.

00:06:21.515 --> 00:06:24.118
Right, I bet their boss
stole the Planet Egg and

00:06:24.118 --> 00:06:26.153
turned this place
into a waterworld.

00:06:26.153 --> 00:06:28.456
I knew there was something
fishy goin' on.

00:06:29.557 --> 00:06:30.258
[Growling]

00:06:30.258 --> 00:06:30.958
Ah!

00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.828
[Sounds of fighting]

00:06:33.828 --> 00:06:38.332
[Growling]

00:06:38.332 --> 00:06:39.834
Run while you have the chance!

00:06:39.834 --> 00:06:41.002
I'm not afraid.

00:06:41.002 --> 00:06:43.170
I've got a black
belt in karate now!

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:44.739
You know karate?

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:50.911
Tanaka gave me martial
arts lessons.

00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:53.814
I'll chop through these fishy
freaks and turn 'em into sushi!

00:06:54.782 --> 00:06:56.817
Hmm!

00:06:56.817 --> 00:06:57.785
Ha!

00:06:59.453 --> 00:07:00.655
Huh?

00:07:00.655 --> 00:07:01.622
Ahh.

00:07:03.324 --> 00:07:04.258
Hmm.

00:07:04.859 --> 00:07:05.826
Uhh!

00:07:07.762 --> 00:07:08.829
Uhh.

00:07:08.829 --> 00:07:09.797
Ah!

00:07:09.797 --> 00:07:11.565
Quit kidding around, Chris!

00:07:11.565 --> 00:07:13.334
I'm not a kid!

00:07:14.268 --> 00:07:17.305
Get going! I'll take care of them!

00:07:17.305 --> 00:07:19.640
Don't you want me to help you?

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.975
That's okay.

00:07:20.975 --> 00:07:23.678
Leave the fightin' to
the experts, Chris.

00:07:24.178 --> 00:07:26.681
No wonder Sonic doesn't believe me.

00:07:26.681 --> 00:07:28.616
I have the skills
of an 18-year-old,

00:07:28.616 --> 00:07:31.152
but the strength of a 12-year-old.

00:07:31.152 --> 00:07:34.922
Maybe I can stop these things
with a surprise counter attack.

00:07:36.424 --> 00:07:37.258
Hm.

00:07:37.258 --> 00:07:38.426
Ah!

00:07:38.926 --> 00:07:40.361
Gotcha!

00:07:40.361 --> 00:07:41.395
Huh?

00:07:41.395 --> 00:07:44.465
Aah!

00:07:44.465 --> 00:07:47.401
Aaah!

00:07:47.401 --> 00:07:48.336
[Roaring]

00:07:48.336 --> 00:07:49.103
Ah!

But, Sonic—

00:08:03.918 --> 00:08:05.886
Get in that sub and get going!

00:08:05.886 --> 00:08:07.488
Look behind you!

00:08:07.488 --> 00:08:08.556
Huh?

00:08:12.126 --> 00:08:15.162
[Growling]

00:08:15.162 --> 00:08:16.864
Uhhh!!

00:08:16.864 --> 00:08:21.402
Huh!

00:08:23.671 --> 00:08:25.339
Just don't panic.

00:08:34.515 --> 00:08:36.984
Whoa! Whoa!

00:08:37.718 --> 00:08:39.387
Aaaah!

00:08:39.387 --> 00:08:40.888
They got him.

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.425
Uhhhhh!

00:08:44.425 --> 00:08:46.927
Just hold on, Sonic.
I'm coming for ya!

00:08:46.927 --> 00:08:50.598
[Growling]

00:08:50.598 --> 00:08:53.200
Go before the Metarex get you!

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.403
I won't leave you!

00:08:55.403 --> 00:08:56.537
You have to.

00:08:56.537 --> 00:08:59.473
If they catch you, neither
one of us'll survive!

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:04.845
All right, I'll go.

00:09:05.946 --> 00:09:09.884
[Growling]

00:09:11.218 --> 00:09:13.354
You hang in there, Sonic.

00:09:22.919 --> 00:09:24.955
TAILS: Sonic was captured?

00:09:24.955 --> 00:09:27.858
Yeah, but I'm going
back to rescue him.

00:09:27.858 --> 00:09:30.761
By yourself? There's no way, Chris!

00:09:30.761 --> 00:09:33.363
Trust me, I know what
I'm doing, Tails.

00:09:33.363 --> 00:09:34.765
No, you don't!

00:09:34.765 --> 00:09:36.399
I do!

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.735
But what's your plan, Chris?

00:09:38.735 --> 00:09:41.338
I'll fly back to where
Sonic is, and I—

00:09:41.338 --> 00:09:43.940
Uh... I don't know.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.610
We can save Sonic
if we use teamwork!

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:50.180
There's no reason for you
to go it all alone, okay?

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.648
Okay.

00:09:51.648 --> 00:09:53.316
[Beeping]

00:09:53.316 --> 00:09:55.418
This is the Blue Typhoon. Over.

00:09:55.418 --> 00:09:56.586
It's Amy.

00:09:56.586 --> 00:09:58.455
I'm calling from under the island.

00:09:58.455 --> 00:10:01.091
I have some bad news about Sonic.

00:10:01.091 --> 00:10:02.325
He got captured.

00:10:02.325 --> 00:10:03.960
How'd you find that out?

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.963
I just made a whole
bunch of new friends.

00:10:06.963 --> 00:10:09.332
They saw the Metarex
capturing Sonic.

00:10:09.332 --> 00:10:11.268
We've gotta go rescue him, Amy!

00:10:11.268 --> 00:10:12.803
I'll take care of it, Chris.

00:10:12.803 --> 00:10:15.872
These folks will show me
where Sonic's being held.

00:10:15.872 --> 00:10:18.175
When he sees me coming, his
heart'll start pounding

00:10:18.175 --> 00:10:19.743
faster than my hammer!

00:10:19.743 --> 00:10:20.410
[Giggling]

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.112
"Thanks for saving me Amy!"

00:10:22.112 --> 00:10:23.713
"My pleasure, Sonic!"

00:10:23.713 --> 00:10:26.983
"Amy, you're the most beautiful
girl in the universe."

00:10:26.983 --> 00:10:28.685
"Oh Sonic, really?"

00:10:28.685 --> 00:10:31.354
"Now I see what a fool I've
been for waiting so long, Amy.

00:10:31.354 --> 00:10:32.823
Will you marry me?"

00:10:32.823 --> 00:10:35.158
"Aaah! Sonic, of course I will!"

00:10:35.158 --> 00:10:36.726
[Kissing sounds] Uhh... excuse me?

00:10:36.726 --> 00:10:38.028
Is that you, Sonic?

00:10:38.028 --> 00:10:39.362
No, it's me, Chris.

00:10:39.362 --> 00:10:42.232
We have to rescue
Sonic right away, Amy!

00:10:42.232 --> 00:10:44.968
What do you mean "we"? I
don't need a chaperone!

00:10:44.968 --> 00:10:46.703
Okay!

00:10:46.703 --> 00:10:49.606
Tails, I'll need some
time to set Sonic free.

00:10:49.606 --> 00:10:52.275
Pick us up in the X Tornado
in an hour, got it?

00:10:52.275 --> 00:10:53.476
Sure, Amy.

00:10:53.476 --> 00:10:56.112
Need any help getting
the X Tornado ready?

00:10:56.112 --> 00:10:57.747
I don't think so, Chris.

00:10:57.747 --> 00:11:00.183
Why don't you go take a rest?

00:11:00.183 --> 00:11:02.419
You might want to
wash up a bit, too.

00:11:02.419 --> 00:11:03.553
Hmm?

00:11:05.488 --> 00:11:06.990
Oh.

00:11:08.658 --> 00:11:11.795
I learned so much in
the past six years.

00:11:12.229 --> 00:11:15.765
I got self-confidence when
Tanaka taught me self-defense.

00:11:16.466 --> 00:11:20.637
Grandpa gave me flying lessons and
helped me get my pilot's license.

00:11:20.637 --> 00:11:24.808
I even got a part-time job after school
so I could get work experience.

00:11:24.808 --> 00:11:28.411
But now it's like I'm back
where I was six years ago.

00:11:28.411 --> 00:11:31.381
Leave the fightin' to
the experts, Chris.

00:11:31.381 --> 00:11:35.285
Maybe it wasn't such a good
idea to come here after all.

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:42.559
Sonic and the others
don't need my help.

00:11:42.559 --> 00:11:45.061
They all have incredible powers.

00:11:45.795 --> 00:11:47.364
Every time we get into trouble,

00:11:47.364 --> 00:11:50.700
one of them jumps into
action and saves the day,

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.903
and I just stand there watching.

00:11:52.903 --> 00:11:55.872
I want to help, but what can I do?

00:11:55.872 --> 00:11:59.342
Even Cream and Cheese
can do more than I can.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:03.780
I may as well face it—I'm
totally useless,

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.949
and I should've stayed home.

00:12:19.362 --> 00:12:20.230
[Breaking glass]

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:21.197
[Gasp]

00:12:24.267 --> 00:12:25.235
I'm coming.

00:12:26.536 --> 00:12:29.940
But something told me
Sonic was in danger.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.543
That's why I had to
come here. I had to!

00:12:34.511 --> 00:12:36.313
HELEN: Are those your
new designs, Chris?

00:12:36.313 --> 00:12:38.581
Well, they're just some ideas.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:41.985
Let me see.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.089
Hmm, interesting.

00:12:46.089 --> 00:12:47.157
What's this?

00:12:47.157 --> 00:12:48.758
It doesn't have a name yet,

00:12:48.758 --> 00:12:49.592
but if it works,

00:12:49.592 --> 00:12:53.330
it could help Sonic get energy
wherever he needs it out in space.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:54.331
And this?

00:12:54.331 --> 00:12:56.266
These are speed shoes.

00:12:56.266 --> 00:12:58.201
The soles are made from
a special compound

00:12:58.201 --> 00:12:59.803
that helps the shoe
grip the ground,

00:12:59.803 --> 00:13:01.571
CHRIS: while at the same time reducing—

00:13:01.571 --> 00:13:03.506
Maybe they're all silly.

00:13:03.506 --> 00:13:05.709
I think they're all wonderful.

00:13:05.709 --> 00:13:06.943
You do?

00:13:06.943 --> 00:13:08.578
[Laughing]

00:13:08.578 --> 00:13:10.080
I do.

Heh.

00:13:13.583 --> 00:13:15.885
I have learned a lot in six years!

00:13:15.885 --> 00:13:17.887
And Sonic does need me!

00:13:17.887 --> 00:13:19.556
I can help him!

00:13:29.432 --> 00:13:31.067
This is the only entrance.

00:13:31.067 --> 00:13:33.770
I'm afraid it will be impossible
to reach your friend.

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:34.871
I'll get in.

00:13:34.871 --> 00:13:35.972
How can you?

00:13:35.972 --> 00:13:38.174
I'll use a little
friendly persuasion.

00:13:38.174 --> 00:13:41.311
I warn you—those
guards are vicious!
