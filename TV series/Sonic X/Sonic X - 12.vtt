I guess I've seen every place
there is to see on this planet,

except for the places
I'd have to swim to.

[Applause]

00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:21.430
Bye-bye, my friends.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.865
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:00:23.965 --> 00:00:26.234
- Bye-bye!
- Chao! Chao!

00:00:26.668 --> 00:00:29.738
I thought you two
might like a little snack.

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:33.375
- Thank you, Ella.
- Chao!

00:00:33.508 --> 00:00:34.910
Chao!

00:00:35.043 --> 00:00:37.379
We interrupt our regularly
scheduled program

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:40.949
to go live to our SSTV
correspondent, Scarlet Garcia.

00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:43.552
The president's top aide
is going to make a statement

00:00:43.652 --> 00:00:46.722
before taking questions
from the press corps.

00:00:46.822 --> 00:00:50.525
The president has decided to
take action to stop Dr. Eggman.

[Camera shutters clicking]

Without any explanation

00:01:16.118 --> 00:01:18.153
No talk of relaxation

00:01:18.253 --> 00:01:19.788
Don't, don't, don't

00:01:19.888 --> 00:01:21.556
Don't blink, don't think

00:01:21.656 --> 00:01:23.392

Go, go

Sonic is on the run

Sonic, he's number one

MAN:
Has the administration developed

00:02:02.574 --> 00:02:05.110
a concrete plan
to stop Dr. Eggman?

00:02:05.243 --> 00:02:05.777
Yes.

00:02:05.877 --> 00:02:07.045
DR. EGGMAN:
Oh, yeah?

00:02:07.145 --> 00:02:09.748
I hope they've come up with
a disaster management plan

00:02:09.848 --> 00:02:11.783
because they're
going to need it.

00:02:11.883 --> 00:02:13.552
[Laughs evilly]

00:02:32.137 --> 00:02:35.674

[Airplane passing]

00:02:53.325 --> 00:02:55.760
Amy, there's my house
down there.

00:02:55.894 --> 00:02:56.828
Which one?

00:02:56.928 --> 00:02:59.064
Do you see the one
with the red roof?

00:02:59.164 --> 00:03:01.633
Yeah.
That's great, Francis.

00:03:01.733 --> 00:03:04.135
You should come
for a visit sometime.

00:03:04.236 --> 00:03:06.137
I will.
Thanks.

00:03:06.238 --> 00:03:07.472
Hey, Chris!

00:03:07.572 --> 00:03:10.842
Do you think we can fly
over our school?

00:03:10.942 --> 00:03:12.978
Well, I... Maybe.

00:03:13.078 --> 00:03:15.647
Guys, this isn't
a sight-seeing trip.

00:03:15.747 --> 00:03:18.416
We've gotta hurry and track down
the next Chaos Emerald

00:03:18.516 --> 00:03:20.719
or Eggman will get it
before we do.

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.021
I know, Tails.
Sorry.

00:03:23.121 --> 00:03:24.456
TAILS:
It's all right.

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:27.025
Where did you get
those new high-tech goggles?

00:03:27.158 --> 00:03:28.860
From your grandpa?

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.830
No, my teacher, Mr. Stewart,
gave them to me.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:32.464
Like them?

00:03:32.597 --> 00:03:34.566
Mm-hmm.
They look pretty cool.

00:03:34.666 --> 00:03:37.969
Yeah, they're one
of the best gifts I ever got.

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:48.947
[Radio static]

00:03:49.047 --> 00:03:50.115
FRANCIS:
Amy, look!

00:03:50.215 --> 00:03:52.918
There's the school
Chris and I go to.

00:04:06.564 --> 00:04:09.234
The power generators
for Eggman's base

00:04:09.334 --> 00:04:12.237
are located under the tower,
Mr. President.

00:04:12.337 --> 00:04:13.071
Oh.

00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:17.776
This information came
to us from Rouge and Topaz.

00:04:18.643 --> 00:04:21.046
Well, Rouge, I'm glad
my confidence in you

00:04:21.146 --> 00:04:22.781
wasn't misplaced.

00:04:22.881 --> 00:04:25.283
This spy stuff
is right up my alley.

00:04:25.383 --> 00:04:27.519
We're all very grateful.

00:04:27.619 --> 00:04:30.088
Now, let's review
our attack plan.

00:04:30.188 --> 00:04:31.589
Right.

00:04:32.657 --> 00:04:34.659
You're taking
all the credit, I see.

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:37.062
- I did do all the work.
- [Groans]

00:04:40.665 --> 00:04:43.601
It'll be a two-pronged assault
from both sea and air.

00:04:43.702 --> 00:04:45.337
Hmm.
Yes.

00:04:45.437 --> 00:04:48.206
But what if Eggman's robots
counterattack?

00:04:48.306 --> 00:04:50.575
These forces are a diversion.

00:04:50.675 --> 00:04:53.778
Eggman will deploy his robots
against this frontal assault.

00:04:53.878 --> 00:04:56.381
Meanwhile, a special
forces team will approach

00:04:56.481 --> 00:04:59.551
from the opposite side and sneak
into the base from the rear.

00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:01.820
Once they break
into the generator room,

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.055
they'll cut off
Eggman's power supply.

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:07.125
They'll be backed up by a team
from the intelligence agency

00:05:07.225 --> 00:05:09.194
including Rouge
and some other agents.

00:05:09.327 --> 00:05:10.495
Good.

00:05:10.628 --> 00:05:13.264
How come she gets top billing?

00:05:13.365 --> 00:05:14.866
You know how it works, Topaz.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.869
There's a star in every show.
We're just bit players.

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:20.739
Now on to the subject of Sonic.

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:24.142
We're ready to capture him
and force him to work with us.

00:05:24.242 --> 00:05:27.512
Well, now, you see...

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:31.249
I sent someone to try
a more diplomatic approach.

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:32.817
Who, sir?

00:05:33.418 --> 00:05:35.520
[Doorbell rings]

00:05:39.524 --> 00:05:41.259
Good day, sir.

00:05:42.327 --> 00:05:43.228
[Gasps]

00:05:45.063 --> 00:05:47.332
You're the president's aide!

00:05:47.432 --> 00:05:48.700
Is Sonic at home?

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.934
Huh?

00:05:52.037 --> 00:05:54.539
I don't know.
Who's he?

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:56.241
I'd like you to let Sonic know

00:05:56.341 --> 00:05:58.443
that I didn't come here
to capture him.

00:05:58.543 --> 00:06:00.412
I came at the request
of the president

00:06:00.512 --> 00:06:02.280
to ask for his cooperation.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.681
You should also tell Sonic

00:06:03.782 --> 00:06:06.284
that if he does work
with us, he'll be rewarded.

00:06:06.384 --> 00:06:07.819
The president gave his pledge

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:10.255
that Sonic and his friends
will be offered citizenship,

00:06:10.388 --> 00:06:12.791
and they'll be paid
for their services.

00:06:12.891 --> 00:06:16.494
That's all very nice, but I
don't think I know no Sonic.

00:06:16.628 --> 00:06:18.997
We know you know Sonic.

00:06:19.964 --> 00:06:21.466
Ella.

00:06:21.566 --> 00:06:23.368
But how do you know my name?

00:06:23.468 --> 00:06:26.438
We know all about you,
this house, and your visitors.

00:06:26.538 --> 00:06:28.473
I already told you
I don't know nothing,

00:06:28.573 --> 00:06:31.142
so why don't you put an egg
in your shoe and beat it?

00:06:31.242 --> 00:06:34.279
I can cause lots of <i>problemas</i>
for you, lady.

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:36.114
Get Sonic!

00:06:36.714 --> 00:06:38.349
Argh!
Rrr!

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:39.651
- Ugh!
- [Thud]

[Groans, growls]

00:06:48.827 --> 00:06:50.795
What kind of security is this?!

00:06:50.895 --> 00:06:52.163
You're supposed to jump
in front of me!

00:06:52.297 --> 00:06:53.565
I smell like floor wax!

00:06:53.665 --> 00:06:55.333
Ella, who was it?

00:06:55.433 --> 00:06:57.769
Just because he's the
president's big-shot assistant,

00:06:57.869 --> 00:06:59.070
he thinks he can threaten me.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.107
Well, I just showed him
that he's all wet.

00:07:05.577 --> 00:07:07.812
Yes, I see.
Thank you.

00:07:07.912 --> 00:07:09.514
[Telephone clicks in cradle]

00:07:09.614 --> 00:07:11.850
He couldn't even get
in the door to see him.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.186
Who knew hedgehogs
were so headstrong?

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:22.460
It looks like we'll have to stop
Eggman ourselves, Mr. President.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.163
I suppose we'll
have to count Sonic out.

00:07:25.296 --> 00:07:27.031
ROUGE:
You don't need him in the game.

00:07:27.132 --> 00:07:27.966
Huh?

00:07:28.566 --> 00:07:29.968
Ha!

00:07:30.068 --> 00:07:33.471
Not when you've got me
going to bat for you.

00:07:33.571 --> 00:07:36.474
Ah!
You're right, Rouge!

00:07:36.908 --> 00:07:39.277
[Thinking] I'm not going
to let anything stop me

00:07:39.377 --> 00:07:43.248
from getting my hands
on a Chaos Emerald this time.

00:07:53.858 --> 00:07:57.729
Hmm, I wonder where
they could be heading to now.

00:08:05.837 --> 00:08:08.173
The Chaos Emerald's
picking up something.

00:08:08.273 --> 00:08:09.240
That's great!

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.242
See the locator screen?

00:08:11.342 --> 00:08:12.677
South-southeast.

00:08:12.777 --> 00:08:15.647
Chaos Emeralds, here we come!

00:08:27.659 --> 00:08:30.795
Hmm.
They turned again.

00:08:40.171 --> 00:08:42.740
The scopes say there's
a Chaos Emerald in this field.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.475
We beat Eggman to it.

00:08:44.576 --> 00:08:46.578
Open up so we can start looking.

00:08:46.678 --> 00:08:48.112
We can look from here.

00:08:48.213 --> 00:08:50.982
- Hmm?
- Wait and see.

00:08:55.987 --> 00:08:57.622
What's this?

00:09:11.803 --> 00:09:13.404
Wow!

00:09:13.504 --> 00:09:15.540
Wow, Tails, what did you do?

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.743
[Chuckles] I transformed it
into an all-purpose robot

00:09:18.843 --> 00:09:20.278
called the X-Cyclone.

00:09:20.378 --> 00:09:23.615
What do you guys say
we take it for a little stroll?

00:09:23.715 --> 00:09:26.951
Now, let's find
that Chaos Emerald.

00:09:31.823 --> 00:09:34.659
A Chaos Emerald, eh?

00:09:38.363 --> 00:09:40.898
This is Chalkboard Charlie
calling Homeroom.

00:09:41.032 --> 00:09:42.433
Come in, Homeroom.

00:09:42.533 --> 00:09:43.801
Over.

00:09:53.278 --> 00:09:56.180
Looks like there's
a Chaos Emerald under our feet.

00:09:56.281 --> 00:09:57.282
Mm-hmm.

00:09:57.382 --> 00:09:59.484
But we didn't bring a shovel.

00:09:59.584 --> 00:10:02.720
That's okay, 'cause we got
the X-Cyclone to dig for us.

00:10:02.854 --> 00:10:04.088
Isn't that right, Tails?

00:10:04.222 --> 00:10:05.390
Hey, yeah.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.659
You said it was
an all-purpose robot.

00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:10.528
I didn't include
a digging function.

00:10:10.628 --> 00:10:11.262
[All gasp]

00:10:11.396 --> 00:10:13.564
It's not all-purpose,
then, is it?

00:10:13.665 --> 00:10:16.200
Not exactly.

00:10:16.301 --> 00:10:18.603
Guys, I bet the farmhouse we saw

00:10:18.703 --> 00:10:20.271
has a shovel we could borrow.

00:10:20.371 --> 00:10:23.274
Huh?
I'll go with you.

00:10:29.147 --> 00:10:32.383
This may well be our only
opportunity, Mr. President.

00:10:32.483 --> 00:10:35.186
If Eggman leaves to chase
after that Chaos Emerald,

00:10:35.286 --> 00:10:36.888
we can attack the base
while he's gone,

00:10:36.988 --> 00:10:38.990
which will improve
the odds for our success.

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:41.192
And we'll have Eggman
on the run.

00:10:41.326 --> 00:10:42.460
Hmm.

00:10:44.329 --> 00:10:46.197
Mr. President?

00:10:51.536 --> 00:10:53.671
All right, then.

00:10:53.771 --> 00:10:56.174
Let's get this job done.

00:10:56.274 --> 00:10:58.376
[Siren wails]

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.916
I wonder what's up now.

00:11:08.586 --> 00:11:10.655
[Radio tuning]

00:11:15.993 --> 00:11:18.329
Now, folks, let's see
how a single application

00:11:18.429 --> 00:11:21.432
of V-10 stain remover handles
this gooey grease stain.

00:11:21.532 --> 00:11:24.168
Wow!
Look at that.

00:11:24.268 --> 00:11:26.170
That's rad.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:27.905
Let's call and order some.

00:11:28.005 --> 00:11:29.607
[Groans]

00:11:29.707 --> 00:11:32.744
I wish that stuff
got rid of infomercials, too.

00:11:32.844 --> 00:11:34.445
Just think.

00:11:34.545 --> 00:11:37.081
You'll save a fortune
with just one bottle of...

00:11:37.181 --> 00:11:39.584
MAN: They found
a Chaos Emerald in a cornfield

00:11:39.684 --> 00:11:40.752
near Tingaling Villa.

00:11:40.885 --> 00:11:43.020
What kind of show is this?!

00:11:43.154 --> 00:11:43.921
Grr!

00:11:44.055 --> 00:11:45.990
WOMAN:
Yes, near Tingaling Villa.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:47.525
A giant jet landed there,

00:11:47.658 --> 00:11:49.894
and they're starting to dig
right now.

00:11:49.994 --> 00:11:52.930
Call in the next 10 minutes
and receive a bonus bottle

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.866
at no extra cost.

00:11:54.966 --> 00:11:56.134
[Growls]

00:11:56.234 --> 00:11:57.869
Bring the cards.

00:11:57.969 --> 00:12:00.338
Here you are, Doctor.

00:12:01.005 --> 00:12:02.106
Now, then.

00:12:02.206 --> 00:12:03.808
Hmm.

00:12:05.309 --> 00:12:08.079
I'm not sure.
Hee hee!

00:12:15.953 --> 00:12:16.921
Ah!

00:12:17.054 --> 00:12:19.090
Funfun!
Perfect.

00:12:40.545 --> 00:12:42.280
There he goes.

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.449
Get ready to mobilize.

00:12:48.386 --> 00:12:50.354
MAN:
Squadron A is away.

00:12:50.455 --> 00:12:53.825
Squadron B, get set for your run
on the island.

00:12:54.425 --> 00:12:56.794
They're attacking Eggman's base.

00:13:08.539 --> 00:13:10.041
It must be deep.

00:13:10.141 --> 00:13:11.409
Just keep digging.

00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:12.944
- [Rumbling]
- What's that?

00:13:13.044 --> 00:13:15.179
Sounds like a jet.

00:13:15.279 --> 00:13:17.081
[All gasp]

00:13:20.384 --> 00:13:21.786
Who's that?

00:13:24.288 --> 00:13:26.157
Oh, no, it's Dr. Eggman!

00:13:26.257 --> 00:13:28.226
Do something!

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:35.066
DR. EGGMAN: Have you found
my Chaos Emerald yet?

00:13:35.166 --> 00:13:37.502
- We're not gonna give it you.
- That's right!

00:13:37.602 --> 00:13:38.970
Very well.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:40.738
I'll just take it, then.

00:13:40.838 --> 00:13:43.608
Hey, I'd better find
a phone and call Sonic.

00:13:43.708 --> 00:13:45.109
Tell him to hurry.

00:13:45.209 --> 00:13:46.310
Come on, Francis.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.746
Oh. Oh.

00:13:49.347 --> 00:13:51.983
Go!
Get them, Funfun!

00:13:52.083 --> 00:13:53.584
Stop him, X-Cyclone.

00:13:53.684 --> 00:13:55.253
Let's go!

00:14:07.031 --> 00:14:08.933
Aah!

00:14:09.534 --> 00:14:11.435
Amy!

00:14:11.536 --> 00:14:13.204
Whoa!

00:14:15.039 --> 00:14:17.608
You're blowing those brats away.
[Laughs]

00:14:17.708 --> 00:14:19.410
Good work!

00:14:25.082 --> 00:14:26.183
Uh-oh!

00:14:26.284 --> 00:14:27.952
Aah!

00:14:31.088 --> 00:14:33.157
[Both panting]

00:14:45.303 --> 00:14:46.771
[Laughs evilly]

00:14:46.871 --> 00:14:50.441
This is the most fun fun
I've had in a long time.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:54.045
[Grunting]

00:14:54.145 --> 00:14:57.148
The control stick is jammed up.

00:15:04.722 --> 00:15:08.259
That cornfield must be
around here somewhere.

00:15:08.359 --> 00:15:09.527
Huh?

00:15:14.532 --> 00:15:16.233
Huh? Huh.

00:15:16.334 --> 00:15:18.769
Huh? Uh.
[Groans]

00:15:20.871 --> 00:15:23.374
They're heading the other way.

00:15:23.474 --> 00:15:25.276
All right.

00:15:53.371 --> 00:15:55.239
What's happening?

00:15:55.339 --> 00:15:57.375
It's an attack, you bolt-brain!

00:15:57.475 --> 00:15:59.510
Those fighter planes
are firing at us

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:01.012
And there are battleships, too.

00:16:01.112 --> 00:16:02.246
We will show them!

00:16:02.346 --> 00:16:04.749
Let us launch a counterattack.

00:16:32.643 --> 00:16:35.880
They're putting up
quite a fight.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.716
Now let's knock out the power.

00:16:48.459 --> 00:16:51.195
[Clears throat]
My fellow civilians...

00:16:51.295 --> 00:16:52.830
I mean, my fellow citizens.

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:54.732
Today our millinery...

00:16:54.832 --> 00:16:56.767
No, our military sources...

00:16:56.867 --> 00:16:59.704
We go live in 15 seconds,
Mr. President.

00:17:01.972 --> 00:17:03.340
[Clears throat]

00:17:03.441 --> 00:17:06.243
We interrupt our regular
broadcast to bring you

00:17:06.343 --> 00:17:09.080
this live emergency address
from the president.

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:12.283
My fellow citizens,
today our military forces

00:17:12.383 --> 00:17:14.585
launched an all-out assault
against the headquarters

00:17:14.685 --> 00:17:16.087
of Dr. Eggman.

00:17:16.187 --> 00:17:19.090
Despite warnings, Dr. Eggman
has continued to threaten

00:17:19.223 --> 00:17:21.792
the peace and well-being
of our nation.

00:17:21.926 --> 00:17:25.696
We have to tell Sonic
about this.

00:17:25.796 --> 00:17:27.531
Chao!

00:17:27.631 --> 00:17:28.966
Chao!

00:17:29.867 --> 00:17:30.835
Chao!

00:17:33.437 --> 00:17:34.939
PRESIDENT:
This conflict is unfortunate,

00:17:35.039 --> 00:17:37.441
but we cannot allow
Dr. Eggman to achieve

00:17:37.541 --> 00:17:39.577
his goal of world domination.

00:17:39.677 --> 00:17:43.080
We must stop him now
before it is too late.

00:18:30.216 --> 00:18:33.052
Hey, Tails, let's go...
[Gasps]

00:18:33.152 --> 00:18:36.556
How could he leave
without you, Sonic?

00:18:37.757 --> 00:18:39.058
Hi, there, Sonic.

00:18:39.158 --> 00:18:42.462
Tails went flying with Amy and
Chris and his friend Francis.

00:18:42.562 --> 00:18:43.830
I'm not sure where.

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.264
They left awhile ago,

00:18:45.364 --> 00:18:47.967
so I don't think they'll
be gone too much longer.

00:18:48.067 --> 00:18:51.304
[Groans]
Lousy time for a joyride!

00:18:55.575 --> 00:18:57.810
These are the goggles
I gave Chris.

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:00.213
I hope he's okay.

00:19:05.618 --> 00:19:08.254
Ugh! The wind's
got us pinned down.

00:19:08.354 --> 00:19:10.523
[Moaning]

00:19:16.863 --> 00:19:18.331
Amy!

00:19:18.431 --> 00:19:19.766
Don't worry!

00:19:19.866 --> 00:19:22.635
I'm almost there.

00:19:31.611 --> 00:19:33.613
I won't let you win, Eggman.

00:19:33.746 --> 00:19:35.515
[Laughs]

00:19:35.648 --> 00:19:38.985
That measly machine of yours
is no match for my robot.

00:19:39.085 --> 00:19:40.486
Oh, yeah?

00:19:40.586 --> 00:19:41.587
[Laughs]

00:19:41.721 --> 00:19:44.223
Let's compete to see
whose robot rules.

00:19:44.323 --> 00:19:47.994
Knocking the wind out of your
puny X-Cyclone will be a breeze.

00:19:53.332 --> 00:19:54.767
[Laughs evilly]

00:19:54.867 --> 00:19:57.503
It seems Tails
is in way over his head.

[Grunting]

00:20:08.815 --> 00:20:10.683
Aah!

00:20:13.686 --> 00:20:15.254
Huh?

00:20:16.689 --> 00:20:19.325
Aah!
I can't see!

00:20:21.694 --> 00:20:24.096
It's like a tornado.

00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:32.004
[Deep voice] Is this
the Thorndyke residence?

00:20:32.104 --> 00:20:34.407
CHUCK:
Yes, that's right. Sorry.

00:20:34.507 --> 00:20:36.509
What did you say?
Speak up.

00:20:36.609 --> 00:20:39.178
They're at Tingaling Villa?
Thanks a lot.

00:20:39.312 --> 00:20:42.014
I'll send someone
after them right away.

00:20:42.648 --> 00:20:44.050
Who was that, Grandpa?

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.018
He wouldn't say who he was.

00:20:46.118 --> 00:20:48.888
Chris needs your help
at Tingaling Villa.

00:20:49.488 --> 00:20:50.890
Right.

00:20:52.325 --> 00:20:53.726
ANNOUNCER:
Can Sonic get to his friends

00:20:53.826 --> 00:20:55.261
fast enough to save them?

00:20:55.361 --> 00:20:57.330
Find out next time.
