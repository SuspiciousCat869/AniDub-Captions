00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:08.108
Let's see.

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:11.411
It says the town's located deep
in the mountains.

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:14.248
I guess we'll have to
transfer here.

00:00:14.348 --> 00:00:15.816
It should take another hour.

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:18.919
What?
How far do we have to go?

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.687
It's not that far, Amy.

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:23.724
Why not think of this as just
part of the adventure?

00:00:23.824 --> 00:00:26.560
Camping's not
my idea of an adventure.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.196
We're gonna have lots of fun.
I promise!

00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:30.731
All right.
If you say so.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:31.798
I do!

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:33.433
[Giggles]

00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:38.438
Chris, you know a good place to
set up camp when we get there?

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.108
I hear there's a great place
near a river north of here.

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:43.544
It's nice and peaceful,
and it's good for fishing, too.

00:00:43.644 --> 00:00:45.913
Hey, that sounds like
a perfect spot.

00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:48.649
Maybe you and I could go
for a swim, Cheese.

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:49.816
Sound fun?

00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:50.918
Chao!

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:54.988
Bus service to
Hot Springs Village.

00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:01.728
This is Stewart.
Do you read me?

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:02.996
Listen carefully.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.999
The bus to Hot Springs Village
leaves every hour on the hour

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:08.435
from bus stop number three.

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:10.537
Have you got that?

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.841
All right, students, line up!

00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:17.311
The bus will be here
any minute now.

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:18.312
[Whistle blows]

00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:21.315
- Mr. Stewart sure is excited.
- I'll say.

00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:23.750
Hey, Francis, how come
Mr. Stewart's coming?

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.853
Wouldn't this trip be a lot more
fun if it was just us kids?

00:01:26.954 --> 00:01:29.656
Don't know. Maybe he wants
to have some fun, too.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:33.560
All I can say is this whole
camping thing better be fun,

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.396
or they're gonna hear it
from me.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.332
Where's Sonic, anyway?

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:40.000
Sonic's not much for camping.

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.269
He says he's gonna explore
the city.

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:44.371
He's on his way there now.

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:51.878
Go, go, go, go, go

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.413
Gotta go fast

00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:55.616
Gotta go fast

00:01:55.716 --> 00:01:58.652
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:02:00.287 --> 00:02:03.724
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:02:03.824 --> 00:02:05.525
Got ourselves a situation

00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:07.828
Stuck in a new location

00:02:07.928 --> 00:02:11.398
Without any explanation

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:13.500
No talk of relaxation

00:02:13.634 --> 00:02:15.102
Don't, don't, don't

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:16.870
Don't blink, don't think

00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:18.739
Just go, go, go, go

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:20.207
Go, go

00:02:24.011 --> 00:02:25.746
Sonic is on the run

00:02:25.846 --> 00:02:27.648
Sonic, he's number one

00:02:27.748 --> 00:02:31.385
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

Look at that!

00:02:54.163 --> 00:02:56.198
Chao! Chao!

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:15.884
Mr. Tanaka, we're here.

00:03:16.485 --> 00:03:18.554
I trust you had a safe trip.

00:03:18.687 --> 00:03:21.590
Your homeland really is
beautiful, Mr. Tanaka.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.891
Thank you, Master Chris.

00:03:23.025 --> 00:03:25.628
I hope you and your friends
will enjoy your stay here.

00:03:25.761 --> 00:03:28.597
It certainly was a wonderful
place for a boy to grow up.

00:03:28.697 --> 00:03:30.866
I can see why.

00:03:33.335 --> 00:03:35.904
Where do we go from here,
Mr. Tanaka?

00:03:36.005 --> 00:03:38.173
Well, just follow me
and I will take you.

00:03:38.274 --> 00:03:41.777
Now, hold on
just a minute there, sir!

00:03:41.877 --> 00:03:44.046
Just let me
get out my flag here.

00:03:44.146 --> 00:03:46.148
I will be your official guide!

00:03:46.248 --> 00:03:48.984
Step lively, kids!

00:03:49.084 --> 00:03:50.686
CREAM:
Look at the mountains!

00:03:50.786 --> 00:03:52.454
FRANCIS:
And all the nature around us!

00:03:52.588 --> 00:03:55.524
Nothing but blue skies,
trees, grass.

00:03:55.658 --> 00:03:57.459
Sure is pretty, huh, Cream?

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:00.029
It's the most beautiful place
we've ever seen.

00:04:00.162 --> 00:04:01.130
Isn't it, Cheese?

00:04:01.263 --> 00:04:02.698
Chao! Chao!

00:04:13.175 --> 00:04:15.577
What's this smelly thing?

00:04:15.678 --> 00:04:16.845
An onion.

00:04:16.945 --> 00:04:19.815
Mr. Tanaka's fixing us
some lunch.

00:04:21.183 --> 00:04:24.253
You do that just like
a real chef, Mr. Tanaka.

00:04:24.353 --> 00:04:25.788
It takes great concentration.

00:04:25.921 --> 00:04:30.059
Would you like to help me mix
the dressing for the salad?

00:04:30.192 --> 00:04:33.028
Well, sure.
Why not?

00:04:33.128 --> 00:04:35.531
This camping trip
won't be so bad after all.

00:04:35.631 --> 00:04:36.932
I have to keep an eye on Chris,

00:04:37.032 --> 00:04:39.168
but that doesn't mean
I can't have fun.

00:04:39.268 --> 00:04:42.538
Here's a bowl to put
the vegetables in, Mr. Tanaka.

00:04:42.638 --> 00:04:44.273
Perfect.

00:04:44.373 --> 00:04:46.709
I think I'm beginning to
like this.

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:48.210
Got it!

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.845
Aw!

00:04:49.945 --> 00:04:51.947
You just missed.

00:04:53.315 --> 00:04:56.051
Whoa! That's the coolest thing
I've ever seen!

00:04:56.151 --> 00:04:58.821
I'm gonna put it in a jar
and take it home.

00:04:58.954 --> 00:05:02.358
I thought we were only
collecting bugs that fly.

00:05:02.458 --> 00:05:04.226
Hello, there, little guy.

00:05:04.326 --> 00:05:07.229
Wow, look at all the fish,
Cream!

00:05:07.329 --> 00:05:09.698
Yeah, there's some.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.935
It jumped!

00:05:13.035 --> 00:05:14.937
[Laughs]

00:05:15.037 --> 00:05:17.439
Cheese, watch out!

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:19.441
Chao!

00:05:19.541 --> 00:05:21.343
Chao! Chao!

00:05:21.443 --> 00:05:22.811
Oh, Cheese!

00:05:22.911 --> 00:05:24.313
Come back!
No!

00:05:24.413 --> 00:05:26.815
Cream, we have to tell
the others!

00:05:26.915 --> 00:05:28.817
Chao! Chao! Chao!

00:05:30.552 --> 00:05:32.554
Cheese must be
up the river somewhere.

00:05:32.654 --> 00:05:34.289
About a mile from this spot,

00:05:34.423 --> 00:05:37.126
the river splits off
in two different directions.

00:05:37.226 --> 00:05:39.962
There is no telling which way
the current was traveling.

00:05:40.062 --> 00:05:42.531
[Sobbing] Cheese!

00:05:42.631 --> 00:05:44.867
Don't cry, Cream.
It'll be okay.

00:05:44.967 --> 00:05:47.936
Remember, Cheese is
a very good swimmer.

00:05:48.036 --> 00:05:50.539
Yeah, Amy's right.

00:05:51.306 --> 00:05:52.708
I feel so bad.

00:05:52.808 --> 00:05:54.443
I should have done something.

00:05:54.543 --> 00:05:57.546
Don't feel bad.
It's not your fault.

00:05:58.213 --> 00:05:59.815
The current may be rapid,

00:05:59.915 --> 00:06:02.718
but there are many areas
where the water is shallow.

00:06:02.818 --> 00:06:06.054
Cheese may very well be stuck
in a patch of sand somewhere.

00:06:06.188 --> 00:06:08.757
Let's all search right away!

00:06:08.891 --> 00:06:11.960
Okay! We'll start
an official search party!

00:06:12.094 --> 00:06:13.996
ALL:
Yeah!

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:19.368
[Groaning]

00:06:21.403 --> 00:06:24.606
My feet are killing me.

00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:30.679
I can't take anymore!

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:33.348
It must be 120 degrees out here!

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:37.686
Actually, Doctor, it is exactly
95 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:06:37.786 --> 00:06:39.955
Mine says 35 degrees Celsius,

00:06:40.088 --> 00:06:43.125
which is really the same
as 95 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:06:43.258 --> 00:06:45.427
Either way,
we are talking hot stuff.

00:06:45.561 --> 00:06:46.995
Be quiet!

00:06:47.095 --> 00:06:49.565
I didn't ask you
for a weather report.

00:06:49.665 --> 00:06:51.233
Decoe, my chair!

00:06:51.333 --> 00:06:53.669
Bocoe, my fan!

00:06:53.769 --> 00:06:55.504
All righty.

00:06:55.604 --> 00:06:56.738
There we go.

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:58.640
Nice and cool.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.175
Ahh!

00:07:00.275 --> 00:07:01.910
Pretty please, Doctor,

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.313
can't we have our vacation
back at the Egg Fort

00:07:04.413 --> 00:07:06.114
where it is nice and cool?

00:07:06.215 --> 00:07:08.984
No. The theme of this vacation
is roughing it,

00:07:09.084 --> 00:07:12.020
and like it or not,
that's what we're going to do.

00:07:12.154 --> 00:07:13.121
Oh, well.

00:07:13.222 --> 00:07:15.224
At least mosquitoes
don't like robots.

00:07:15.357 --> 00:07:17.326
I just hope you brought enough
calamine lotion.

00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:18.527
Quiet!

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.929
[Bokkun giggling]

00:07:23.332 --> 00:07:24.366
Hi!

00:07:24.466 --> 00:07:25.901
What are you doing here?

00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:29.371
I gave strict orders
not to be disturbed.

00:07:29.471 --> 00:07:30.973
I know, I know.

00:07:31.073 --> 00:07:34.209
But I thought you should know
about this.

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:39.882
Cheese, we're coming to get you!

00:07:39.982 --> 00:07:42.684
Answer us if you can hear us!

00:07:42.784 --> 00:07:44.887
Cheese, are you there?

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.489
What are those clowns
doing here?

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:49.491
This sure is a coincidence.

00:07:49.558 --> 00:07:52.060
Perhaps they are looking
for a Chaos Emerald.

00:07:52.194 --> 00:07:53.328
Well, so am I!

00:07:53.428 --> 00:07:54.863
Get down!
They'll see us!

00:07:54.963 --> 00:07:58.400
In order to observe,
we must remain incognito.

00:07:59.167 --> 00:08:01.703
Oh, I'll remain incognito,
all right.

00:08:01.803 --> 00:08:04.740
As incognito as a snake
in the grass.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.175
Cheese, are you there?

00:08:07.276 --> 00:08:09.211
[Shouting indistinctly]

00:08:16.051 --> 00:08:16.685
Yow!

00:08:16.785 --> 00:08:18.987
That pesky mosquito
just sunk its stinger

00:08:19.121 --> 00:08:20.923
into my soggy wet noodle!

00:08:21.056 --> 00:08:23.859
It is not like
we did not warn him.

00:08:23.959 --> 00:08:25.994
All right, you lazy leeches.

00:08:26.128 --> 00:08:28.964
I want every mosquito here
insecticided!

00:08:29.064 --> 00:08:31.033
Couldn't we just use bug spray?

00:08:31.133 --> 00:08:32.034
Whoa!

00:08:32.134 --> 00:08:34.269
Behind you.

00:08:41.343 --> 00:08:43.245
[Screaming]

00:08:48.884 --> 00:08:51.286
That cursed insect.

00:08:51.987 --> 00:08:54.856
Hey, was that a voice
coming from over there?

00:08:54.957 --> 00:08:56.625
Was it Cheese?

00:08:56.758 --> 00:08:58.660
It sounded like a man.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.729
Maybe someone else is camping.

00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:01.797
Maybe.

00:09:01.897 --> 00:09:03.465
Cheese!

00:09:03.565 --> 00:09:05.033
We're on our way!

00:09:06.735 --> 00:09:09.538
What if Cheese
is inside that tunnel?

00:09:09.638 --> 00:09:11.540
I'll look.

00:09:14.142 --> 00:09:16.044
I'm afraid I can't fit.

00:09:16.144 --> 00:09:18.814
I'll bet we could all fit
no problem.

00:09:18.914 --> 00:09:21.049
You wait here
while we check it out.

00:09:21.149 --> 00:09:22.351
All right.

00:09:22.451 --> 00:09:23.785
Promise you'll be careful.

00:09:23.885 --> 00:09:25.287
Okay.

00:09:28.857 --> 00:09:30.859
Just make sure
you don't lose your way.

00:09:30.993 --> 00:09:33.195
We won't.

00:09:40.202 --> 00:09:41.103
Hey!

00:09:41.203 --> 00:09:43.572
They're coming in
loud and clear.

00:09:50.679 --> 00:09:51.580
Hey!

00:09:56.685 --> 00:09:57.819
Wow!

00:09:59.421 --> 00:10:01.323
Sonic!

00:10:01.423 --> 00:10:03.725
Try a pastry.

00:10:03.825 --> 00:10:05.293
Thanks.

00:10:07.396 --> 00:10:08.797
You like it?

00:10:09.431 --> 00:10:10.799
It's good.

00:10:13.402 --> 00:10:15.237
Guess this is the end
of the tunnel.

00:10:15.337 --> 00:10:17.172
I wonder what's out here?

00:10:17.272 --> 00:10:18.040
What?

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.775
[Both gasp]

00:10:19.875 --> 00:10:22.577
Is this real?

00:10:25.698 --> 00:10:28.034
It can't be!

00:10:31.771 --> 00:10:34.173
Hey, they all look
just like Cheese.

00:10:34.273 --> 00:10:35.675
I can't believe it.

00:10:35.775 --> 00:10:38.044
It's a Chao colony.

00:10:41.147 --> 00:10:43.549
They're all so cute.

00:10:44.517 --> 00:10:46.786
Hey, look, Chris.
They really like us.

00:10:46.886 --> 00:10:49.455
Yeah, I guess they can sense
that we're friendly.

00:10:49.555 --> 00:10:52.425
Hey, this one
wants to go for a swim.

00:10:52.525 --> 00:10:55.561
Cheese, is that you?

00:10:55.661 --> 00:10:57.363
I guess not.

00:10:57.463 --> 00:10:59.165
Cheese! Sorry.

00:10:59.265 --> 00:11:01.934
Chao! Chao!

00:11:02.068 --> 00:11:03.536
There you are!

00:11:03.669 --> 00:11:04.871
Cheese!

00:11:04.971 --> 00:11:05.771
Chao!

00:11:05.872 --> 00:11:08.274
Oh, Cheese, you're okay!

00:11:08.374 --> 00:11:09.809
Chao! Chao!

00:11:09.909 --> 00:11:11.644
She's so happy.

00:11:11.744 --> 00:11:13.246
Come on out of that water,
Cream.

00:11:13.346 --> 00:11:14.947
You're getting your feet
all soggy.

00:11:15.081 --> 00:11:16.149
I don't mind.

00:11:16.249 --> 00:11:18.484
All that matters
is Cheese is okay.

00:11:18.584 --> 00:11:21.220
She sure is.
Are you happy?

00:11:21.687 --> 00:11:23.556
Looks like Cheese
made some friends.

00:11:23.656 --> 00:11:25.658
- Chao! Chao!
- Chao! Chao!

00:11:25.758 --> 00:11:26.492
What's up?

00:11:26.592 --> 00:11:28.861
They're all excited
about something.

00:11:28.961 --> 00:11:30.563
I'll bet they're just happy

00:11:30.663 --> 00:11:33.699
that Cheese found her friends
again, that's all.

00:11:33.799 --> 00:11:35.301
I think you're right.

00:11:35.401 --> 00:11:38.671
It really is pretty here,
don't you think?

00:11:38.771 --> 00:11:41.841
Sure is.
Let's look around.

00:11:41.974 --> 00:11:43.676
There he is!

00:11:43.809 --> 00:11:46.412
Up there on the roof!

00:11:48.614 --> 00:11:49.515
Hi, Sonic!

00:11:49.615 --> 00:11:52.518
Hey!

00:11:53.219 --> 00:11:55.021
Hiya, girls!

00:11:55.121 --> 00:11:56.856
Sonic!

00:11:56.956 --> 00:11:59.859
Oh, now I won't have a picture.

00:11:59.959 --> 00:12:03.095
CHRIS: Come on.
Throw the ball, Danny!

00:12:03.863 --> 00:12:05.398
- Chao! Chao!
- Chao! Chao!

00:12:05.498 --> 00:12:07.767
Hey, nice catch.

00:12:07.867 --> 00:12:10.369
These look great.
Here.

00:12:10.469 --> 00:12:11.737
Here you go.

00:12:12.638 --> 00:12:14.473
Look how they gobble them up.

00:12:14.574 --> 00:12:16.976
Hey, Tails, do the Chao
on your planet

00:12:17.076 --> 00:12:19.078
have little colonies
like this, too?

00:12:19.212 --> 00:12:21.981
Yep. They have colonies
in a lot of places,

00:12:22.081 --> 00:12:24.050
but there has to be
plenty of fresh water.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.519
And since the water
has to be kept clean,

00:12:26.619 --> 00:12:29.155
most of the Chao colonies
are kept a secret.

00:12:29.255 --> 00:12:31.224
I guess they're kept a secret
here, too.

00:12:31.324 --> 00:12:33.426
I've never seen
anything like this.

00:12:33.526 --> 00:12:35.595
It's like
a whole different world.

00:12:35.695 --> 00:12:38.731
Yeah, a secret world.

00:12:40.466 --> 00:12:43.402
How much longer
do we have to keep this up?

00:12:43.502 --> 00:12:45.871
Please, can't we go home,
Dr. Eggman?

00:12:45.972 --> 00:12:47.373
My bearings are killing me.

00:12:47.473 --> 00:12:49.475
Aah!

00:12:49.575 --> 00:12:51.143
Quit your whining, will you?

00:12:51.244 --> 00:12:53.246
I refuse to spend
my week's vacation

00:12:53.379 --> 00:12:55.781
listening to your
incessant bellyaching!

00:12:55.881 --> 00:12:58.117
[Panting]

00:12:58.985 --> 00:13:00.720
I think he has heatstroke.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:01.854
Never mind him.

00:13:01.954 --> 00:13:05.157
If we don't stop roughing it
soon, I'm going to overheat.

00:13:05.258 --> 00:13:08.394
Decoe, I order you
to empty that knapsack.

00:13:08.494 --> 00:13:10.496
Right away, Doctor.

00:13:12.098 --> 00:13:13.499
Huh?

00:13:15.601 --> 00:13:18.704
While I know this camping trip
is about getting back to nature,

00:13:18.838 --> 00:13:20.973
there are certain amenities
one cannot do without,

00:13:21.073 --> 00:13:23.376
and this is one of them.

00:13:23.876 --> 00:13:25.945
In we go!

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:32.918
A perfect choice.

00:13:33.019 --> 00:13:36.689
And now to wake up
our little friend E-66.

00:13:54.273 --> 00:13:56.809
Do you think they're okay,
Mr. Tanaka?

00:13:56.942 --> 00:13:59.378
I'm sure they are just fine.

00:13:59.512 --> 00:14:00.413
When I was a boy,

00:14:00.513 --> 00:14:02.782
I would play in those mountains
from sunrise to sunset.

00:14:02.882 --> 00:14:04.350
They will be back soon.

00:14:04.483 --> 00:14:08.487
You mean once you were a young
boy like Chris, Mr. Tanaka?

00:14:08.587 --> 00:14:09.388
Certainly.

00:14:09.488 --> 00:14:11.991
I'll have you know
I was not always a grown-up.

00:14:12.091 --> 00:14:13.759
Everyone is a child once.

00:14:13.859 --> 00:14:14.894
Children!

00:14:15.628 --> 00:14:17.863
You mean they haven't
come back here yet?

00:14:17.963 --> 00:14:19.899
But we thought
they were with you.

00:14:19.999 --> 00:14:22.668
We were looking for Cheese,
and we found a small tunnel.

00:14:22.768 --> 00:14:25.838
The children went in to look,
and I haven't seen them since.

00:14:25.971 --> 00:14:27.440
Where could they be?

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.141
They must have gotten lost.

00:14:29.275 --> 00:14:32.411
Well, at first, I was tracking
Chris' whereabouts

00:14:32.511 --> 00:14:34.046
with this monitor,

00:14:34.146 --> 00:14:37.149
but soon after they entered
the tunnel, I lost contact.

00:14:37.249 --> 00:14:38.651
I hope they're okay.

00:14:41.887 --> 00:14:43.289
Aah!

00:14:47.393 --> 00:14:48.794
It's Eggman!

00:14:51.397 --> 00:14:53.532
Goodbye, you guys.

00:14:53.632 --> 00:14:55.534
ALL:
Chao! Chao!

00:14:59.538 --> 00:15:00.573
Chao!

00:15:00.673 --> 00:15:02.575
- See you later!
- See you later!

00:15:06.045 --> 00:15:07.947
Chao. Chao.

00:15:08.047 --> 00:15:10.449
You feel Ionesome,
don't you, Cheese?

00:15:10.549 --> 00:15:13.052
Maybe we can come back
here next year.

00:15:13.152 --> 00:15:16.489
We can pack some sandwiches
and maybe play some baseball.

00:15:16.589 --> 00:15:19.024
And Cheese can play
with her new friends again.

00:15:19.125 --> 00:15:21.560
Yeah!
Cheese, that sound good?

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:22.795
Chao! Chao!

00:15:22.895 --> 00:15:25.064
Chao! Chao!

00:15:25.164 --> 00:15:26.265
[Screaming]

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.461
[Laughs evilly]

00:15:34.561 --> 00:15:37.965
Good day, my little explorers!

00:15:38.065 --> 00:15:39.266
Him again!

00:15:45.572 --> 00:15:47.141
Okay, kiddies, let's have it!

00:15:47.241 --> 00:15:49.610
Hand over
that Chaos Emerald or else!

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:51.412
What Chaos Emerald?

00:15:51.512 --> 00:15:52.846
What are you talking about?

00:15:52.946 --> 00:15:54.882
Don't play coy with me!

00:15:54.982 --> 00:15:58.585
What else would you scavengers
be snooping around here for?

00:15:58.685 --> 00:16:00.320
Now, hand it over!

00:16:01.422 --> 00:16:03.190
He must have seen us
looking for Cheese

00:16:03.323 --> 00:16:05.626
and thought we were hunting
for a Chaos Emerald.

00:16:05.726 --> 00:16:07.861
So that's why he's so upset.

00:16:07.961 --> 00:16:11.131
Hey, there aren't
any Chaos Emeralds around here!

00:16:11.231 --> 00:16:12.299
[Groans]

00:16:12.399 --> 00:16:15.102
You can't fool me,
you Emerald snatchers!

00:16:15.202 --> 00:16:17.171
Do not get overexcited, Doctor.

00:16:17.271 --> 00:16:19.873
You are beginning to perspire.

00:16:19.973 --> 00:16:21.842
Well, then,
if you mite-sized meddlers

00:16:21.942 --> 00:16:23.277
won't cooperate with me,

00:16:23.377 --> 00:16:27.080
perhaps my friend E-66
will convince you!

00:16:28.549 --> 00:16:29.950
[All screaming]

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:31.618
[Laughs evilly]

00:16:34.855 --> 00:16:38.325
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

00:16:48.202 --> 00:16:49.837
How did that happen?

00:16:49.937 --> 00:16:52.806
I guess the soil around here
must be really soft.

00:16:52.906 --> 00:16:55.142
Maybe that's why
that big thing tipped over.

00:16:55.242 --> 00:16:58.479
It serves him right for siccing
his robot on us.

00:16:58.579 --> 00:17:00.614
Oh, no!
The water!

00:17:00.714 --> 00:17:02.616
It's all muddy!

00:17:02.716 --> 00:17:03.550
Chao! Chao!

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:07.321
Hey, you guys, that river
runs into the Chao colony.

00:17:07.454 --> 00:17:09.289
Come on.
We have to do something.

00:17:09.423 --> 00:17:10.991
Let's go!

00:17:11.892 --> 00:17:14.661
Who ever heard
of a mushy mountain?

00:17:14.761 --> 00:17:15.729
I have a feeling

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:19.633
that E-66 and rugged terrain
do not go hand in hand.

00:17:19.733 --> 00:17:22.803
He might be more effective
on hard, flat surfaces.

00:17:22.903 --> 00:17:24.438
Keep quiet!

00:17:24.538 --> 00:17:26.807
Now, help me dig out
this cast-iron klutz.

00:17:26.907 --> 00:17:29.009
We've got some Emeralds to snag.

00:17:34.281 --> 00:17:36.483
The cleaning is completed,
Doctor!

00:17:36.583 --> 00:17:38.352
Well, let's get going!

00:17:38.452 --> 00:17:40.354
Dr. Eggman, look!

00:17:40.454 --> 00:17:42.189
Sonic!

00:17:42.823 --> 00:17:44.258
Fancy meeting you here.

00:17:44.358 --> 00:17:45.425
Well, Sonic.

00:17:45.559 --> 00:17:48.262
I, uh...
I mean, we.

00:17:48.395 --> 00:17:50.731
We were just doing a lovely bit
of sightseeing.

00:17:50.831 --> 00:17:53.166
Yes.
For our vacation.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.171
Ah!

00:17:58.272 --> 00:18:00.007
You're on vacation.

00:18:00.107 --> 00:18:01.608
Yes. Vacation.

00:18:01.708 --> 00:18:04.111
See, I've been such
an old gloomy Gus of late

00:18:04.211 --> 00:18:06.680
that I thought some leisure time
in the fresh air

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:08.348
might do me a bit of good.

00:18:08.448 --> 00:18:09.750
He so needs it.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:11.752
That so?

00:18:11.852 --> 00:18:13.520
Let it fly!

00:18:16.523 --> 00:18:17.858
He's gone!

00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:19.159
Hi, there.

00:18:19.259 --> 00:18:21.061
Haven't you clowns learned yet

00:18:21.161 --> 00:18:24.831
you'll never be
fast enough to catch me?

00:18:24.932 --> 00:18:26.433
Later, kids!

00:18:35.375 --> 00:18:37.644
[Screaming]

00:18:42.115 --> 00:18:44.051
AMY:
Sonic!

00:18:44.151 --> 00:18:47.054
Sonic, you have to do something!

00:18:47.154 --> 00:18:50.290
Oh, I see you've already
done something.

00:18:50.424 --> 00:18:52.359
Cheese got lost
down by the river.

00:18:52.459 --> 00:18:54.928
They all went looking,
but they haven't come back.

00:18:55.028 --> 00:18:56.463
I'll find them.

00:18:56.563 --> 00:18:58.565
Hold this, will you?

00:19:08.508 --> 00:19:10.444
DANNY: We'll carry the mud
out with this.

00:19:10.544 --> 00:19:12.646
CHRIS:
I don't think we can get it all.

00:19:12.746 --> 00:19:14.448
We have to at least try, Chris.

00:19:14.548 --> 00:19:16.783
Otherwise, all those little
Chao will get sick.

00:19:16.883 --> 00:19:18.285
That's right, Francis.

00:19:18.385 --> 00:19:20.887
And if we all work together,
it'll be a cinch.

00:19:20.988 --> 00:19:23.156
SONIC:
Now, that's what I like to hear.

00:19:23.256 --> 00:19:26.259
So all we got to do
is get rid of that mud.

00:19:26.393 --> 00:19:27.260
It's Sonic!

00:19:27.394 --> 00:19:30.297
Might want to let me
take care of this.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.935
Here goes!

00:20:02.095 --> 00:20:04.498
Okay, gang, it's all cleaned up.

00:20:04.598 --> 00:20:05.966
[Cheering]

00:20:06.066 --> 00:20:08.468
- Chao! Chao!
- Chao! Chao!

00:20:08.568 --> 00:20:10.337
Sonic, you did it!

00:20:10.437 --> 00:20:12.539
You're all muddy.

00:20:12.639 --> 00:20:14.207
Wow, we really are dirty.

00:20:14.307 --> 00:20:15.776
Guess I need a bath.

00:20:15.876 --> 00:20:17.711
Thanks for doing that, Sonic.

00:20:17.811 --> 00:20:20.180
Hey, my pleasure.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.049
[Laughter]

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:27.387
Bet you knew all about the Chao
colony, didn't you, Mr. Tanaka?

00:20:27.487 --> 00:20:29.389
Of course I knew, Master Chris.

00:20:29.523 --> 00:20:32.259
I stumbled upon that colony
when I was a boy.

00:20:32.392 --> 00:20:34.628
Don't worry.
We'll keep it a secret.

00:20:34.728 --> 00:20:37.931
Thanks to Sonic, maybe it'll
still be here when I'm grown up.

00:20:38.031 --> 00:20:40.767
And perhaps even beyond,
Master Chris.
