00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:09.910
SONIC: Shouldn't we be
out trying to stop Eggman

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.979
instead of taking a coffee break?

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:14.348
I'm hoping we can put our heads together

00:00:14.348 --> 00:00:16.817
and unravel the mystery of
Eggman's Chaos creature.

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:22.089
It's the most powerful thing I've ever seen.

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.592
We watched it gulp down two Chaos
Emeralds like they were candy.

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:27.928
They made that thing even stronger.

00:00:27.928 --> 00:00:31.999
CHUCK: It sounds as if it's going to be
a real challenge to defeat this creature.

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:33.934
It will.

00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:36.937
I knew it would be trouble
when I saw it on Angel Island.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.673
After Chaos Control happened,

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:42.943
Angel Island was transported into this world.

00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:47.147
That's where the Master Emerald was,
and I guarded it around the clock.

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:51.585
One night, a huge bolt
of lightning woke me up.

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:53.186
[Rumbling]

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:55.155
This wasn't an ordinary thunderstorm.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:59.092
Something very strange was
happening at the summit.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.030
I knew the Master Emerald was in danger.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.698
But it was too late.

00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:07.000
And that's when I saw it.

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:10.137
Go, go, go, go, go

00:01:10.137 --> 00:01:13.240
Gotta go fast

00:01:13.874 --> 00:01:16.176
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:21.982
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:01:21.982 --> 00:01:24.051
Got ourselves a situation

00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:26.086
Stuck in a new location

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:29.723
Without any explanation

00:01:29.723 --> 00:01:31.792
No talk of relaxation

00:01:31.792 --> 00:01:33.427
Don't, don't, don't

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:35.195
Don't blink, don't think

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:37.030
Just go, go, go, go

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.532
Go, go

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:44.037
Sonic is on the run

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:45.939
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.643
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:49.643 --> 00:01:53.347
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

Gotta go faster,

Gotta go faster, faster,

Sonic X

00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:14.158
If the Master Emerald's on Angel Island,

00:02:14.158 --> 00:02:16.527
why aren't you there now protecting it?

00:02:16.894 --> 00:02:18.429
Because it's too late.

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:21.232
The Chaos creature made sure of that.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.135
Hey! Who are you?

00:02:24.135 --> 00:02:26.704
[Growls threateningly]

00:02:31.642 --> 00:02:33.745
What happened to the Master Emerald?

00:02:33.745 --> 00:02:35.780
Are you the one who destroyed it?

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.715
[Roars in response]

00:02:39.584 --> 00:02:42.220
[Grunting]

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.227
Wait!

00:02:49.827 --> 00:02:52.096
Blast! Where did that thing go?

00:02:52.096 --> 00:02:54.031
[Rumbling]

00:02:54.031 --> 00:02:54.999
Now what?

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:59.103
[Rumbling]

00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:02.874
The Master Emerald keeps this
island hovering in the air.

00:03:02.874 --> 00:03:04.909
But it can't if it's shattered!

00:03:15.887 --> 00:03:19.757
You shouldn't blame yourself for
what that creature did, Knuckles.

00:03:19.757 --> 00:03:22.260
Big, when you went looking
for Froggy in the forest,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.529
didn't you see something
that looked like Chaos?

00:03:24.962 --> 00:03:26.464
Ohh...

00:03:38.376 --> 00:03:39.510
Ribbit.

00:03:41.212 --> 00:03:42.280
Ribbit!

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.315
[Gulps]

00:03:46.584 --> 00:03:49.887
Hey, ya find another one, Froggy?

00:03:52.156 --> 00:03:53.191
Hmm?

00:03:53.925 --> 00:03:56.093
[Struggles]

00:03:57.161 --> 00:04:01.165
Hey, am I seeing things?
You're growing a tail!

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.668
Ribbit...

00:04:04.635 --> 00:04:06.137
Ribbit!

00:04:07.805 --> 00:04:11.409
I tried to catch Froggy,
but he was faster than me

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.145
and he hopped away with something
I found in the forest.

00:04:14.145 --> 00:04:15.680
What was that?

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.615
It was a big purple rock.

00:04:17.615 --> 00:04:20.218
It looked awful pretty when it was glowin'.

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:22.887
That sounds like it could've
been a Chaos Emerald!

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:24.589
If that's the case,

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:28.392
then we'd better find that little
frog quick or it won't survive long.

00:04:28.392 --> 00:04:29.627
Why, Grandpa?

00:04:30.127 --> 00:04:33.464
Because Dr. Eggman is determined
to do anything to seize an Emerald.

00:04:34.098 --> 00:04:36.234
The more Emeralds he feeds
that Chaos creature,

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:38.302
the easier it'll be to take over this world.

00:04:48.813 --> 00:04:50.047
What is it?

00:04:50.047 --> 00:04:50.781
[Screams]

[Explosions]

00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:01.959
It's vital we find those Emeralds

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:04.529
before Eggman uses their
power to conquer us all.

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:06.464
No sweat! I'll find 'em.

00:05:06.464 --> 00:05:08.399
You have a plan, Sonic?

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:11.035
You know I prefer to think on my feet.

00:05:11.035 --> 00:05:14.205
I'll go and look for the broken
pieces of the Master Emerald.

00:05:14.205 --> 00:05:17.542
I guess Big and I can go try
to find Froggy together.

00:05:17.542 --> 00:05:20.444
Hmm. That's a good idea.

00:05:38.696 --> 00:05:45.002
[Mechanical tinkering]

00:05:45.002 --> 00:05:46.404

Hey!

00:05:48.573 --> 00:05:50.041
Hiya Sonic!

00:05:50.641 --> 00:05:53.911
So we have to track down the
Chaos Emeralds all over again.

00:05:53.911 --> 00:05:56.547
If we fail, Eggman'll win.

00:05:56.547 --> 00:05:58.082
You think you're up to the challenge?

00:05:58.082 --> 00:06:00.985
[Laughs] I already started collecting 'em!

00:06:01.586 --> 00:06:02.553

I just found this Emerald yesterday.

00:06:11.963 --> 00:06:14.932
We can use it to pinpoint where
all the other Emeralds are.

00:06:14.932 --> 00:06:17.568
It'll make tracking 'em down a lot easier.

Woah.

00:06:51.769 --> 00:06:53.704
What happened, officer?

00:06:53.704 --> 00:06:54.438
Huh?

Hey, it's Knuckles!

00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:58.509
Woah! Think you and me
could get a picture taken

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:00.711
to show the guys back at the station?

00:07:00.711 --> 00:07:02.213
Maybe later.

Do you guys have any idea what
smashed into that building?

00:07:04.982 --> 00:07:05.950
Well, sorta.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.420
Witnesses say it was a glowing
object that fell from the sky.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.788
A what?! You're sure?

00:07:10.788 --> 00:07:13.190
Well I-uhh!!

This place <i>seems</i> like Mystic Ruin.

00:07:53.564 --> 00:07:56.267
But the buildings should be ancient!

00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:57.668
Why do they look brand new?

TIKAL: We must stop the invasion, Father.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:10.581
Tikal, you know I must seize those
Emeralds for the good of our tribe.

00:08:10.581 --> 00:08:12.516
When we have them, we will be strong.

00:08:12.516 --> 00:08:14.452
But this plan of yours is foolish!

00:08:14.919 --> 00:08:16.887
It will bring nothing but grief to our land,

00:08:16.887 --> 00:08:20.257
and cause needless pain and
suffering to our neighbors.

00:08:20.257 --> 00:08:22.493
There must be another way.

00:08:22.493 --> 00:08:24.395
We should not try to help our own kind

00:08:24.395 --> 00:08:26.330
by bringing harm to someone else.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:27.465
It's wrong.

00:08:39.744 --> 00:08:41.512
Huh? Hmm.

00:08:42.046 --> 00:08:45.382
Since there wasn't a crime, we won't
need that rock as evidence, will we?

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.252
No! Knuckles can keep it.

00:08:48.252 --> 00:08:51.155
