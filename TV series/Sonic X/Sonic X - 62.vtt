[Gasp]

00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:09.510
Hi, there, Cosmo!

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.011
How are you doing today?

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.213
Be sure to give your
mother our regards.

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:14.581
We'll see you later, Cosmo!

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:16.250
Okay! Goodbye!

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.218
Ah!

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:20.053
Galaxina!

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:21.989
There you are, Cosmo.

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:24.992
You've had Mother
worrying all afternoon.

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:27.027
I didn't mean to.

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:29.029
I was playing my
pretend game again,

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.431
and I must have forgotten
what time it was.

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:33.233
Don't worry, little Cosmo.

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:36.270
We're all pretty used to
your daydreaming by now.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.237
Ah.

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:39.773
Hmph.

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:50.717
Sorry to worry you, Mother.

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.219
She was dreaming again.

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.154
Like always.

00:00:56.123 --> 00:00:58.292
Hey, have you ever wondered

00:00:58.292 --> 00:01:00.527
if Mother likes to
daydream too, sometimes?

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:02.696
Well, maybe.

00:01:02.696 --> 00:01:05.198
I'll bet she dreams about
being back home again,

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:06.400
like I do.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.734
Yes.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:10.037
I'm sure it's a great
comfort to her, to

00:01:10.037 --> 00:01:13.006
hope that one day, we'll
all be back there.

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:14.408
Galaxina,

00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:16.109
the Elders say we'll be journeying

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:18.512
through space like this forever.

00:01:18.512 --> 00:01:19.947
Not forever, Cosmo.

00:01:19.947 --> 00:01:23.383
Just until we destroy the evil
Metarex monsters for good.

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:27.921
Only then can we rest, and search
for a new planet to call home.

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.289
Ah.

00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:31.592
Come on, let's go!

00:01:31.592 --> 00:01:33.827
Mother has many
errands for us today.

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:34.962
Yes.

00:01:34.962 --> 00:01:35.629
Oh!

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:37.998
Goodbye, Mother. See you later!

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:40.267
Go, go, go, go, go

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:43.337
Gotta go fast

00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:46.273
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:52.112
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.181
Got ourselves a situation

00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:56.216
Stuck in a new location

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:59.820
Without any explanation

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.888
No talk of relaxation

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:03.523
Don't, don't, don't

00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:05.325
Don't blink, don't think

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:07.127
Just go, go, go, go

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:08.629
Go, go

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.134
Sonic is on the run

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:16.036
Sonic, he's number one

00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:19.773
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:02:32.953 --> 00:02:35.022
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:02:35.022 --> 00:02:36.056
Sonic X

00:02:41.358 --> 00:02:42.793
Aaaah!

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:53.937
Aah!

00:02:54.371 --> 00:02:57.407
[Whimpering]

00:02:57.407 --> 00:02:59.676
Metarex approaching!

00:02:59.676 --> 00:03:02.946
Sectors 3 and 7 have been
irreparably damaged.

00:03:02.946 --> 00:03:04.948
We can't fight them much longer.

00:03:04.948 --> 00:03:06.483
We have to stop them!

00:03:06.483 --> 00:03:07.584
Ah!

00:03:09.052 --> 00:03:11.054
[Panting]

00:03:12.022 --> 00:03:12.989
Aah!

Cosmo!

00:03:16.793 --> 00:03:17.761
Aah!

00:03:18.462 --> 00:03:19.529
Huh?

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:22.032
[Beeping]

00:03:22.032 --> 00:03:24.401
My com link's indicating
there's a Chaos Emerald

00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:25.869
somewhere nearby.

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:28.004
But it won't pinpoint
where, exactly.

00:03:28.004 --> 00:03:30.207
Could be this one's
buried way underground

00:03:30.207 --> 00:03:31.541
where it's hard to get to.

00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:33.810
Just means we're all gonna
have to work a little harder

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.378
to find it, that's all.

00:03:35.378 --> 00:03:37.681
Well, let's not all stand
here twiddling our thumbs.

00:03:37.681 --> 00:03:39.683
Let's look for this thing!

00:03:39.683 --> 00:03:42.052
Yeah! Move it down there, will ya?

00:03:42.052 --> 00:03:43.019
- Huh?

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:43.954
Ah!

00:03:47.657 --> 00:03:49.159
Good luck everybody!

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:50.560
Be careful, okay?

00:03:56.867 --> 00:03:58.168
Poor Cosmo.

00:03:58.168 --> 00:04:00.470
I wish we could cheer
her up somehow.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.938
Chao chao!

00:04:01.938 --> 00:04:03.373
Hmm.

00:04:03.373 --> 00:04:05.976
It's not easy when your
family's not around.

00:04:05.976 --> 00:04:09.112
In fact, it's just about the
loneliest feeling in the world.

00:04:16.553 --> 00:04:18.522
TAILS: Why do I have
a sneaking suspicion

00:04:18.522 --> 00:04:20.624
the Metarex have been here, too?

00:04:20.624 --> 00:04:23.159
This place gives me the creeps.

00:04:25.695 --> 00:04:28.598
Yup. Just another sad ex-planet.

00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:33.036
Look around...

00:04:33.036 --> 00:04:34.971
Families lived here once.

00:04:34.971 --> 00:04:38.408
Children played all day
without a care in the world.

00:04:38.408 --> 00:04:40.777
They didn't know what was coming.

00:04:42.546 --> 00:04:43.680
Now they're all gone,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.882
just like Mother and Galaxina.

00:04:45.882 --> 00:04:47.551
And they'll never come back.

00:04:48.518 --> 00:04:49.452
[Sigh]

00:04:51.021 --> 00:04:53.189
Sometimes I miss them so much.

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:54.357
Huh?

00:04:54.357 --> 00:04:55.258
What's that?

[Gasp]

00:04:56.693 --> 00:04:57.661
Nothing.

Take a look at this, Tails!

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.570
This has to be at
least a mile deep!

00:05:08.905 --> 00:05:10.574
[Beeping]

00:05:10.574 --> 00:05:11.908
This is it, you guys.

00:05:11.908 --> 00:05:14.811
The Chaos Emerald's
down there somewhere.

Look! A cave!

00:05:30.527 --> 00:05:32.462
You two go check it out.

00:05:32.462 --> 00:05:34.030
We're on it!

00:05:43.473 --> 00:05:46.076
Be careful, Tails.
It's dark in here.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:50.947
[Gasp]

00:05:50.947 --> 00:05:52.148
What's the matter?

00:05:52.148 --> 00:05:54.217
I'm not sure. It felt
like some kind of-

00:05:54.217 --> 00:06:01.725
[Both screaming]

00:06:01.725 --> 00:06:04.294
Aaah! Cosmo! Aah!

[Screaming]

00:06:11.334 --> 00:06:13.870
They're sealed in! Hang on!

00:06:17.273 --> 00:06:20.644
Please, Tails. Oh, please be okay.

00:06:22.712 --> 00:06:23.913
What happened?

00:06:23.913 --> 00:06:24.414
[Gasp]

00:06:24.414 --> 00:06:25.815
Careful, you're hurt.

00:06:25.815 --> 00:06:28.418
I... I'm feeling kinda dizzy.

00:06:28.418 --> 00:06:29.753
Huh?

00:06:29.753 --> 00:06:30.854
Strange.

00:06:30.854 --> 00:06:33.123
I remember walking inside the cave,

00:06:33.123 --> 00:06:35.058
and then hearing this rumbling,

00:06:35.058 --> 00:06:36.893
and then I must've passed out.

00:06:36.893 --> 00:06:37.994
It's my fault.

00:06:37.994 --> 00:06:39.396
If I hadn't touched that thing,

00:06:39.396 --> 00:06:41.031
then none of this
would've happened.

00:06:41.031 --> 00:06:41.865
The button!

00:06:41.865 --> 00:06:43.199
I remember now.

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:45.135
Hey, don't feel too bad, Cosmo.

00:06:45.135 --> 00:06:46.102
This is a good thing.

00:06:46.102 --> 00:06:47.370
We'll tell Chris where we are,

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.005
and then we'll start
looking around.

00:06:49.005 --> 00:06:51.207
What if the Metarex are in here?

00:06:51.207 --> 00:06:54.110
Chris, Amy, do you read me?

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.113
No, good. We must've
lost our connection.

00:06:57.747 --> 00:06:59.049
I'm sorry.

00:06:59.049 --> 00:07:01.951
Don't worry, Cosmo. We'll
make the most of it.

00:07:03.153 --> 00:07:04.220
[Beeping]

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.488
We're still getting a reading,

00:07:05.488 --> 00:07:07.891
so the Emerald's gotta
be down here somewhere.

00:07:07.891 --> 00:07:09.025
Let's go!

00:07:09.025 --> 00:07:10.627
Wait, Tails.

00:07:10.627 --> 00:07:12.562
[Ripping cloth]

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.833
Really, I feel just fine, Cosmo.

00:07:16.833 --> 00:07:17.967
I don't care.

00:07:17.967 --> 00:07:20.904
It's better to be safe,
than sorry, I always say.

00:07:21.337 --> 00:07:22.772
Ahh.

00:07:25.408 --> 00:07:27.343
I just hope they're okay.

00:07:27.343 --> 00:07:29.412
I can't get rid of
this bad feeling.

00:07:29.412 --> 00:07:31.848
If that Emerald is
buried underground,

00:07:31.848 --> 00:07:33.950
things could get kind of dangerous.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:34.918
Don't worry.

00:07:34.918 --> 00:07:37.821
If things get scary, at
least Knuckles is there.

00:07:37.821 --> 00:07:40.190
He wouldn't let anything
happen to them, Chris,

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.025
'cause he's tough.

00:07:42.025 --> 00:07:43.393
Chao!

00:07:43.393 --> 00:07:44.694
Don't sweat it, buddy.

00:07:44.694 --> 00:07:45.528
I got it covered.

00:07:45.528 --> 00:07:48.064
If something goes wrong,
I'll be there in a jiffy.

00:07:48.064 --> 00:07:49.399
Thanks, Sonic.

00:07:49.399 --> 00:07:51.367
Blue Typhoon to X Tornado!

00:07:51.367 --> 00:07:52.802
Chris, do you read me?

00:07:52.802 --> 00:07:53.970
I read you.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:56.206
I just got a radio
message from Knuckles.

00:07:56.206 --> 00:07:58.708
He says Tails and Cosmo are
trapped in a cave somewhere,

00:07:58.708 --> 00:08:00.043
and he can't get through to them!

00:08:00.043 --> 00:08:00.777
[Gasp]

00:08:00.777 --> 00:08:01.811
Hm?

00:08:01.811 --> 00:08:04.080
Hm? Hm.

00:08:06.549 --> 00:08:07.951
You know, I really gotta

00:08:07.951 --> 00:08:10.120
upgrade this thing when
we get outta here.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.055
Like maybe add some
type of software

00:08:12.055 --> 00:08:14.958
that allows you to cut through
subterranean rock formations.

00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.126
Uh-huh.

00:08:16.126 --> 00:08:18.261
I mean, it sure would
make it a lot easier

00:08:18.261 --> 00:08:19.996
to find hidden Chaos Emeralds.

00:08:19.996 --> 00:08:21.931
Plus, we'd have the ability to send

00:08:21.931 --> 00:08:23.433
digitized contact signals

00:08:23.433 --> 00:08:25.668
to and from wherever we might be.

00:08:25.668 --> 00:08:27.170
Even if we're underground,

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:30.907
or outer space in some secret
high-tech laboratory somewhere.

00:08:30.907 --> 00:08:31.641
[Babbles]

00:08:31.641 --> 00:08:33.576
I'm so frightened.

00:08:35.044 --> 00:08:36.980
Mother would know what to do.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.348
Cosmo?

00:08:38.348 --> 00:08:39.082
Huh?

00:08:39.082 --> 00:08:40.049
You okay?

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:41.751
Uh-huh. Just daydreaming.

00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:42.719
Ah!

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.522
Hey, look, Cosmo!

00:08:45.522 --> 00:08:47.791
Like some kind of
fireflies or something.

00:08:48.758 --> 00:08:49.826
Ah!

00:08:55.265 --> 00:08:57.167
I wonder where they're going?

00:08:57.167 --> 00:08:59.102
Yeah! Let's follow 'em.

00:09:05.575 --> 00:09:06.543
Huh?

00:09:06.543 --> 00:09:07.911
Whoa!

00:09:18.268 --> 00:09:19.769
[Grunting]

00:09:19.769 --> 00:09:22.172
There's a whole avalanche
worth of rocks here.

00:09:22.172 --> 00:09:24.741
Something must've
jarred them loose.

00:09:24.741 --> 00:09:26.209
[Grunting]

00:09:26.209 --> 00:09:27.811
Just listen to him in there,

00:09:27.811 --> 00:09:30.380
showing off with those
big, silly claws of his.

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.617
Say what you will, but I
have faith in Knuckles.

00:09:33.617 --> 00:09:34.885
You should too.

00:09:35.919 --> 00:09:38.388
I'm using the infrared
movement tracker,

00:09:38.388 --> 00:09:40.957
but I can't seem to get
a reading from anywhere.

00:09:40.957 --> 00:09:43.860
It looks like a system
of inter-connected caves,

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.963
and I'm guessing there must be
more than one way down there.

00:09:46.963 --> 00:09:48.899
So while Knuckles is
busy boulderizing,

00:09:48.899 --> 00:09:50.867
we can snoop around for a bit.

00:09:50.867 --> 00:09:52.235
Let's hurry.

00:09:52.235 --> 00:09:54.738
It must be awful
spooky in that place.

00:09:54.738 --> 00:09:56.873
I don't like to think
of them down there.

00:09:56.873 --> 00:09:57.741
Chao chao...

00:09:57.741 --> 00:09:59.676
Cheer up! We'll find them.

00:09:59.676 --> 00:10:00.744
Hm!

00:10:05.215 --> 00:10:10.720
[Metarex growling]

00:10:11.688 --> 00:10:13.623
This is a nightmare.

00:10:13.623 --> 00:10:16.393
I think we're both having
the same bad dream.

00:10:16.393 --> 00:10:17.027
Ah.

00:10:18.728 --> 00:10:22.599
The Chaos Emerald is located
somewhere in this complex.

00:10:22.599 --> 00:10:23.600
Ready, Cosmo?

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.267
Mm.

00:10:24.267 --> 00:10:26.202
[Metarex growls]

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:35.578
Huh?

Hm.

00:10:36.813 --> 00:10:41.685
[Panting]

00:10:52.262 --> 00:10:54.998
A whole room full of Emeralds.

00:11:09.713 --> 00:11:13.550
It's some kind of...
manufacturing plant.

00:11:14.985 --> 00:11:16.686
This must be the real one.

00:11:16.686 --> 00:11:18.288
They're feeding off it, somehow.

00:11:18.288 --> 00:11:20.623
So they'll all have the
same kind of power.

00:11:20.623 --> 00:11:21.424
Huh!

00:11:21.424 --> 00:11:23.126
This explains the counterfeit one

00:11:23.126 --> 00:11:25.929
that Metarex had on Planet Breezy!

00:11:25.929 --> 00:11:27.230
[Gasp]

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:30.800
You're right! It looked so
real, it fooled all of us.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.703
And now there's a whole
factory full of them.

00:11:33.703 --> 00:11:36.339
Why would they be doing this?

00:11:36.339 --> 00:11:37.574
I don't know.

00:11:37.574 --> 00:11:41.111
It's weird, but if I can hack into
their computer system somehow,

00:11:41.111 --> 00:11:43.513
we just may be able
to find an answer.

00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:48.685
Some kind of strange code...

00:11:49.219 --> 00:11:51.454
I can't decipher it.

00:11:51.454 --> 00:11:54.124
It says here, Operation Duplicate,

00:11:54.124 --> 00:11:57.027
with a list of key Chaos
Emerald components.

00:11:57.027 --> 00:11:58.094
Let's see...

00:11:58.094 --> 00:12:01.598

93% compression rate,

00:12:03.266 --> 00:12:05.001
You mean you can read this?

00:12:05.001 --> 00:12:06.336
Only some.

00:12:06.336 --> 00:12:07.804
But I'm not all that familiar

00:12:07.804 --> 00:12:10.373
with a lot of the
more technical data.

00:12:10.373 --> 00:12:11.674
Wish I could help more.

00:12:11.674 --> 00:12:13.109
You helped a lot, Cosmo!

00:12:13.109 --> 00:12:16.112
Now let's download this
information right away.

00:12:23.686 --> 00:12:26.956
We'll look at the data when we
get back to the Blue Typhoon.

Will you help me translate?

Sure! I'd love to.

this mess I've gotten you into.

of this if it weren't for you.

I hate to say it, Tails,

but I think the Emerald is
leading them right to us.

Heh.

[Beeping]

00:14:03.653 --> 00:14:05.221
Impossible!

We'll be safe now that
we threw off the Metarex.

And we'll be out
of here in no time!

of how Mother made me feel.

00:14:20.203 --> 00:14:22.605
Like nothing bad could happen.

00:14:22.605 --> 00:14:26.242
It's just so bright,
and warm, and loving.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:31.381
Yeah, I guess Chaos Emeralds
have that effect on folks.

00:14:31.381 --> 00:14:33.283
Ya know, it's kind of interesting.

00:14:33.283 --> 00:14:35.218
You could be in the
worst kind of danger,

00:14:35.218 --> 00:14:37.153
but once you hold a Chaos
Emerald in your hand,

00:14:37.153 --> 00:14:38.788
you feel a lot safer.

00:14:38.788 --> 00:14:39.889
When I was a young girl,

00:14:39.889 --> 00:14:42.025
my older sister Galaxina
used to tell me

00:14:42.025 --> 00:14:44.093
the legend of the Chaos Emeralds.

00:14:44.093 --> 00:14:45.361
And I...

00:14:45.361 --> 00:14:46.930
I used to dream that one day,

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:48.598
I would hold one in my hand, and

00:14:48.598 --> 00:14:50.366
feel all of its magical power.

00:14:50.366 --> 00:14:52.168
A power that is greatest

00:14:52.168 --> 00:14:55.505
when it's used by those who are
pure of heart and intention.

00:14:55.505 --> 00:14:57.207
I don't understand.

00:14:57.207 --> 00:15:00.710
It's power depends on
those who use it, you see.

00:15:01.377 --> 00:15:03.012
Like Sonic, for instance.

00:15:03.012 --> 00:15:06.449
Sonic uses it for goods, so
only good can come of it.

00:15:06.449 --> 00:15:07.617
But then there are those,

00:15:07.617 --> 00:15:09.719
like the Metarex or Dr. Eggman,

00:15:09.719 --> 00:15:11.955
who use it for purposes of evil.

00:15:11.955 --> 00:15:13.656
That's when the power turns

00:15:13.656 --> 00:15:15.925
into something dark
and destructive.

00:15:18.194 --> 00:15:19.062
Huh?

00:15:19.062 --> 00:15:20.129
What's the matter?

00:15:20.129 --> 00:15:23.600
Oh, Tails. I'm not worthy to
be touching the Chaos Emerald.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.568
Please take it away from me.

00:15:27.203 --> 00:15:29.072
Why, Cosmo?

00:15:29.072 --> 00:15:33.209
Because my soul is filled up with
nothing but sadness and hatred.

00:15:33.209 --> 00:15:37.080
Hatred for those monsters
who destroyed my planet.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.415
And took away my family,
and my friends...

00:15:39.415 --> 00:15:41.017
... and everything else
that was precious,

00:15:41.017 --> 00:15:42.685
and left me all alone.

00:15:42.685 --> 00:15:44.087
Huh.

00:15:44.087 --> 00:15:46.589
There is no way any
good comes from me.

00:15:46.589 --> 00:15:49.592
I will only bring you
evil and disaster.

00:15:49.592 --> 00:15:51.027
Cosmo...

00:15:52.695 --> 00:15:53.696
Ah!

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:55.265

is not possible.

Forget it, Tails.

00:16:09.287 --> 00:16:10.922

[Evil laughter]

00:16:16.394 --> 00:16:20.732

to your little friend.

00:16:25.971 --> 00:16:27.372
Okay.

I guess all you Meta-mutants

think you're pretty
tough, don'tcha?

00:16:31.076 --> 00:16:32.644
Well, we're pretty tough, too!

00:16:32.644 --> 00:16:34.279
And we've got good on our side,

00:16:34.279 --> 00:16:36.715
which is more than you can say.

00:16:36.715 --> 00:16:38.483
Tails, don't do it.

00:16:38.483 --> 00:16:40.418
There's nothing to be afraid of.

00:16:40.418 --> 00:16:41.653

your foolishness.

00:17:06.912 --> 00:17:11.249
[Whimpering]

00:17:11.249 --> 00:17:12.017
Huh?

00:17:12.017 --> 00:17:15.053
Tails! Cosmo! Do you read me?

00:17:15.053 --> 00:17:16.555
[Growling]

00:17:16.555 --> 00:17:19.391
Hurry! They've got us!

00:17:20.292 --> 00:17:22.193
Not for long, buddy.

00:17:22.994 --> 00:17:23.762
[Grunting]

00:17:23.762 --> 00:17:28.867
[Metarex grumbles]

00:17:28.867 --> 00:17:31.036
Who dares help the enemy?

00:17:31.036 --> 00:17:32.137
I dare!

00:17:32.137 --> 00:17:32.904
[Growling]

00:17:32.904 --> 00:17:33.872
Hmph!

00:17:34.873 --> 00:17:35.540
Ha!

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.843
[Growling]

00:17:38.843 --> 00:17:40.812
Cosmo, are you okay?

00:17:40.812 --> 00:17:42.080
Sure, I'm fine.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.882
Man, that was close.

00:17:43.882 --> 00:17:45.417
Hey, you two.

00:17:45.417 --> 00:17:46.151
Chao chao!

00:17:46.151 --> 00:17:48.386
You really are life-savers,
you know that?

00:17:48.386 --> 00:17:50.388
Well, yeah.

00:17:50.388 --> 00:17:52.324
Thank goodness, you're safe.

00:17:52.324 --> 00:17:53.658
Now that the mean
monsters are gone,

00:17:53.658 --> 00:17:55.193
and we can all go home.

00:17:55.193 --> 00:17:56.995
That's right, Cream.

00:17:57.329 --> 00:17:58.363
[Metarex growls]

00:17:58.363 --> 00:17:59.965
Not so fast!

00:17:59.965 --> 00:18:01.600
Don't let them get away!

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.835
Bring it on! We're ready for ya!

00:18:03.835 --> 00:18:06.271
You want some more of this, huh?

00:18:07.839 --> 00:18:09.074
- Get 'em, Sonic!

00:18:13.912 --> 00:18:15.313
Hmmm... ha!

00:18:15.814 --> 00:18:17.449
[Growling]

00:18:17.916 --> 00:18:18.883
[Monster grunts]

00:18:23.388 --> 00:18:25.357
Ahh! Oh!

00:18:26.157 --> 00:18:27.225
Oof!

00:18:27.959 --> 00:18:29.394
Chao!

00:18:29.394 --> 00:18:30.328
[Gasp]

00:18:30.729 --> 00:18:33.198
[Grunting]

00:18:33.865 --> 00:18:35.133
[Blowing]

00:18:35.133 --> 00:18:36.935
[Metarex groaning]

00:18:36.935 --> 00:18:37.902
See, Cosmo?

00:18:37.902 --> 00:18:40.805
Nothing but good can come
when you help your friends.

00:18:40.805 --> 00:18:42.507
Right!

00:18:42.507 --> 00:18:43.708
Let's go!

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:48.079
Sonic! I will destroy you!

00:18:48.079 --> 00:18:49.547
Just try!

00:18:49.547 --> 00:18:50.882
Wait!

00:18:50.882 --> 00:18:51.583
Huh?

00:18:51.583 --> 00:18:53.652
Up here, Sonic. Catch!

00:18:53.652 --> 00:18:54.686
[Grunting]

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:55.920
Got it!

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.222
[Metarex growls]

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:00.525
[Chuckling]

00:19:00.525 --> 00:19:01.393
Bye-bye!

00:19:01.393 --> 00:19:06.665
[Metarex screams]

00:19:12.871 --> 00:19:14.406
Ya know, I have a feeling

00:19:14.406 --> 00:19:16.241
whatever's on here might
help us put an end

00:19:16.241 --> 00:19:18.643
to their Planet Egg
plot once and for all.

00:19:18.643 --> 00:19:21.713
Maybe the code will tell us where
all the Planet Eggs are hidden,

00:19:21.713 --> 00:19:23.815
and we can save the galaxy.

00:19:23.815 --> 00:19:25.083
Chao chao!

00:19:25.083 --> 00:19:28.353
That's right! Good thing we have
our brilliant translator with us.

00:19:28.353 --> 00:19:29.287
Huh?

00:19:29.287 --> 00:19:31.423
Well, thanks Amy, but...

00:19:31.423 --> 00:19:34.125
I feel like I put you
all in danger today.

00:19:34.125 --> 00:19:35.326
That's silly.

00:19:35.326 --> 00:19:38.463
Plus, we're used to dangerous
situations by now.

00:19:38.463 --> 00:19:40.398
Danger is our middle name!

00:19:40.398 --> 00:19:41.633
Chao chao!

00:19:43.935 --> 00:19:45.236
[Wink]

00:19:46.604 --> 00:19:48.373
Ah! [Giggling]

00:19:48.373 --> 00:19:51.042
Well, let's get going, you guys.

00:19:51.042 --> 00:19:53.545
We've still got plenty
of Metarex to mangle.

00:19:53.545 --> 00:19:54.479
That's right.

00:19:54.479 --> 00:19:55.914
And thanks to our friend Cosmo,

00:19:55.914 --> 00:19:57.749
this time, we'll be
way ahead of 'em.

00:19:57.749 --> 00:19:58.750
Right, gang?

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.151
ALL: Yeah!

00:20:00.151 --> 00:20:01.586
[Grunt]

00:20:01.586 --> 00:20:03.521
Ah! Finally!

00:20:03.521 --> 00:20:05.123
Hm? Hm?

00:20:05.123 --> 00:20:06.658
They must be around here somewhere.

00:20:07.158 --> 00:20:09.527
Huh? Hey, where did
you guys come from?

00:20:09.527 --> 00:20:12.964
[All laughing]

00:20:12.964 --> 00:20:14.332
What's so funny?

00:20:14.332 --> 00:20:15.767
Think you can stop chuckling

00:20:15.767 --> 00:20:17.635
long enough to get me out of here?

00:20:17.635 --> 00:20:20.271
Hey, come on! I mean it!

00:20:20.271 --> 00:20:22.474
Get me out of here, guys!

00:20:22.474 --> 00:20:26.010
Good. They have
fallen for our bait.

00:20:28.413 --> 00:20:30.615
Soon, they and that fool Eggman

00:20:30.615 --> 00:20:32.684
will be back clutching
Chaos Emeralds

00:20:32.684 --> 00:20:34.853
in their greedy little hands.

00:20:34.853 --> 00:20:39.457
And then, when they least
expect it, I'll strike!

00:20:39.457 --> 00:20:40.692
How perfect.

00:20:40.692 --> 00:20:43.828
One day, they will know the
true extent of my power.

00:20:43.828 --> 00:20:46.197
But by then, it will be too late.
