00:00:00.534 --> 00:00:02.336
Last time,
the president ordered

00:00:02.436 --> 00:00:05.172
an all-out attack
on Dr. Eggman's island base.

00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:08.075
It'll be a two-pronged assault
from both sea and air.

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:10.477
Rouge the Bat,
now working for the government,

00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:12.779
was put in charge
of a special forces team

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.482
to sabotage Eggman's base
from inside.

00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:18.085
Meanwhile, Chris and Tails
discovered the location

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:19.753
of the third Chaos Emerald,

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:22.723
but their plan to unearth it
was gone with the wind.

00:00:22.823 --> 00:00:23.757
[Laughs]

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:26.994
Can our heroes hang on
and capture the Chaos Emerald,

00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:30.063
or will Eggman and his
windy robot blow them away?

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:31.598
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:33.233
Gotta go fast

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.302
Gotta go fast

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:38.372
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:43.443
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:45.212
Got ourselves a situation

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:47.548
Stuck in a new location

00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:51.084
Without any explanation

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:53.220
No talk of relaxation

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.855
Don't, don't, don't

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:56.623
Don't blink, don't think

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:58.458
Just go, go, go, go

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.927
Go, go

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.465
Sonic is on the run

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.334
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:11.071
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:12.573
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:01:12.673 --> 00:01:14.575
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:17.177
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:19.079
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:21.448
Sonic X

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:24.284
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:26.320
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.221
Sonic X

00:01:33.387 --> 00:01:35.789
My fellow citizens,

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:37.591
the assault against
the headquarters

00:01:37.691 --> 00:01:39.393
of Dr. Eggman has begun.

00:01:39.493 --> 00:01:41.495
Our military forces
will press on

00:01:41.595 --> 00:01:44.565
until Eggman is no longer
a threat to the world.

00:01:44.665 --> 00:01:46.233
We will not fail.

00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:49.670
Dr. Eggman must be stopped now.

00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:55.142
Whoa, this'll be
a heavy-duty fight.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.032
[Laughs]

00:02:23.237 --> 00:02:24.805
Aah!

00:02:26.206 --> 00:02:28.175
[Explosion]

00:02:34.915 --> 00:02:35.682
Oh!

00:02:35.782 --> 00:02:37.884
Hold it.

00:02:37.985 --> 00:02:39.286
Why did we stop?

00:02:39.386 --> 00:02:40.921
Because we're about
to get a visit

00:02:41.021 --> 00:02:43.624
from Eggman's Welcome Wagon.

00:02:47.094 --> 00:02:48.362
[Gasps]

00:02:48.462 --> 00:02:49.630
I'll take it.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:50.964
Rouge!

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:58.972
Poor Chris.
He's out here, too.

00:02:59.106 --> 00:03:00.707
This is terrible.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.758
[Moaning]

00:03:19.126 --> 00:03:21.028
We can't stay here!

00:03:21.128 --> 00:03:22.262
Just hang on!

00:03:22.362 --> 00:03:23.964
Francis, get down now!

00:03:24.064 --> 00:03:25.465
- Oh!
- Oh!

00:03:28.468 --> 00:03:30.704
Stay down and don't try
any more stunts.

00:03:30.837 --> 00:03:32.739
Right.
Sorry.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.876
I hope Tails is all right.

00:03:41.248 --> 00:03:43.317
Hey, Tails!

00:03:46.086 --> 00:03:47.387
EGGMAN:
Ha ha ha!

00:03:47.487 --> 00:03:49.089
That's right, Bonbon,

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:51.191
show that furry urchin
who's in charge.

00:03:51.291 --> 00:03:53.327
Put your foot down!

00:03:54.828 --> 00:03:57.798
Oh, oh, oh!

00:03:57.898 --> 00:04:00.067
Hee, hee, hee!

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.671
Oh...

00:04:08.775 --> 00:04:10.677
Aah!

00:04:10.777 --> 00:04:12.679
[Metal creaking]

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:15.148
Ha-ha!
Ta-ta, Tails!

00:04:15.248 --> 00:04:16.817
It's crunch time.

00:04:20.187 --> 00:04:21.321
- [Gasps]
- [Gasps]

00:04:21.421 --> 00:04:22.622
Hmm.

00:04:22.723 --> 00:04:25.125
Aah!
It can't be!

00:04:25.225 --> 00:04:26.927
[Chuckles]

00:04:27.027 --> 00:04:28.428
Hah!

00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:40.073
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

00:04:40.173 --> 00:04:41.608
There he goes.

00:04:41.708 --> 00:04:43.577
Aah!

00:04:43.677 --> 00:04:45.412
Stop it, Bonbon!

00:04:45.512 --> 00:04:48.782
Shut down your glide!

00:04:48.882 --> 00:04:50.851
[Whirring decreases]

00:04:59.893 --> 00:05:02.162
You saved us all!

00:05:02.262 --> 00:05:03.864
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:03.964 --> 00:05:07.100
But, Tails, why'd you wind up
way out here?

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.970
We found out the third
Chaos Emerald is here.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.671
Whoa, that's right!

00:05:11.805 --> 00:05:12.839
I almost forgot!

00:05:12.973 --> 00:05:14.741
Easy, pal.

00:05:14.841 --> 00:05:16.076
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:05:22.716 --> 00:05:25.318
- Aah, aah, aah!
- Cool your jets, big guy.

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.154
Just let him dig up
what he came for,

00:05:27.254 --> 00:05:29.623
and we'll all go away.

00:05:34.494 --> 00:05:37.564
Guess I'll have to knock
the wind out of you.

00:05:39.666 --> 00:05:40.801
Sonic!

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:44.871
Got it!

00:06:02.556 --> 00:06:04.191
Oh, wow!

00:06:04.291 --> 00:06:07.494
EGGMAN:
Why, Tails, you shouldn't have.

00:06:10.964 --> 00:06:12.332
Aah!

00:06:14.167 --> 00:06:16.203
[Laughs]

00:06:21.374 --> 00:06:22.809
- Oh.
- Oh.

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:24.978
Let's go get it back.

00:06:25.111 --> 00:06:26.780
Huh?
Yeah!

00:06:27.848 --> 00:06:29.149
Right!

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:30.350
CHRISTOPHER:
Francis.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.351
Huh?

00:06:31.451 --> 00:06:33.086
What?

00:06:33.787 --> 00:06:37.390
I think it might be better
if you stay here.

00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:38.892
How come, Chris?

00:06:38.992 --> 00:06:40.827
It's gonna be dangerous.

00:06:40.927 --> 00:06:42.362
AMY:
Hey, Chris.

00:06:42.462 --> 00:06:45.098
You're not staying behind,
are you?

00:06:45.198 --> 00:06:47.334
All right!
Let's just go!

00:07:02.315 --> 00:07:03.483
Hah!

00:07:03.583 --> 00:07:05.986
Let's go get them.

Hurry.
Set the charge.

00:07:29.376 --> 00:07:30.677
Okay!

00:07:47.794 --> 00:07:49.863
Our situation
is becoming dangerous.

00:07:49.963 --> 00:07:51.665
Those soldiers
have us outnumbered.

00:07:51.765 --> 00:07:54.000
We must formulate
a new strategy quickly

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.735
before they deactivate us.

00:07:55.869 --> 00:07:57.671

- Oh!

[Beeping]

00:08:00.807 --> 00:08:02.676
Another enemy ship
is approaching.

00:08:02.776 --> 00:08:04.444
This one must not get through!

00:08:04.544 --> 00:08:06.947
Blast them!

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:11.885
Aah!

00:08:11.985 --> 00:08:14.554
Cease fire!
It's me, you scrap-heads!

00:08:20.594 --> 00:08:23.296
The president thinks
he's got me in his sights.

00:08:23.396 --> 00:08:24.464
Ha!

00:08:24.564 --> 00:08:28.368
Well, I hope you didn't
rehearse a victory speech,

00:08:28.468 --> 00:08:30.870
because I'm back in command now.

00:08:30.971 --> 00:08:33.974
Oh! Hey!
Those are my missiles!

00:08:40.013 --> 00:08:42.482
WOMAN ON TV: The attack
appears to be failing.

00:08:42.616 --> 00:08:44.818
Wait.
What's that?

00:08:44.918 --> 00:08:45.819
Huh?

00:08:45.919 --> 00:08:48.355
A new aircraft is on the scene.

00:08:48.455 --> 00:08:50.423
Is that one of ours?

00:08:50.924 --> 00:08:51.825
Ah!

00:08:51.925 --> 00:08:53.793
The X Tornado!

- [Gasps]
- Tornado?

00:08:55.295 --> 00:08:57.297
Where did it come from?

00:08:57.397 --> 00:09:00.133
There's something on the nose
of the craft.

00:09:00.266 --> 00:09:02.035
It's a blue...

00:09:02.168 --> 00:09:03.637
It can't be.

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.805
A blue hedgehog!

00:09:05.939 --> 00:09:07.841
It's Sonic!

00:09:09.943 --> 00:09:11.678
Who is that dude?

00:09:11.778 --> 00:09:13.413
Yeah, what's his name again?

00:09:13.513 --> 00:09:15.482
TOGETHER:
His name is Sonic.

00:09:15.582 --> 00:09:17.984
Sonic the Hedgehog.

00:09:23.872 --> 00:09:24.806
Ha ha ha!

There's another one?

Don't sweat it, sweetie.
I'll handle this robot.

00:09:42.524 --> 00:09:44.359
You lead the team
to the generator room

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:46.595
and set the charges.

00:09:46.695 --> 00:09:49.298
All right, guys, follow me.

00:10:02.678 --> 00:10:03.712

Missed me, slow-bot!

00:10:08.016 --> 00:10:09.418
Ugh!

00:10:34.476 --> 00:10:36.378
Wow!
Thank you.

00:10:36.478 --> 00:10:38.747
You're one of Sonic's friends,
aren't you?

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.349
We're not friends.

00:10:40.482 --> 00:10:42.884
But you do know him, don't you?

00:10:42.985 --> 00:10:44.886
Maybe.

00:10:44.987 --> 00:10:47.522
What are you and your crew
trying to do here, anyway?

00:10:47.656 --> 00:10:50.392
We came here to destroy
Eggman's base.

00:10:50.492 --> 00:10:51.927
In fact, we're on our way

00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:54.629
to sabotage the generator
room right now.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:56.431
There's no way you can do it.

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:59.401
That room will be impossible
to get into.

00:10:59.501 --> 00:11:00.402
Really?

00:11:00.502 --> 00:11:03.605
We have to try.

00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:07.442
You'll fail,
unless you have me along.

00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:09.911
I can't wait to see
the look on Sonic's face

00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:12.581
when he finds out that
I helped defeat Dr. Eggman

00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:14.549
while he missed out
on the glory.

00:11:14.683 --> 00:11:16.418
That'll mess with his ego.

00:11:16.518 --> 00:11:18.820
Sounds like you've got
an inferiority complex.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.223
Huh?
I have a what?

00:11:21.323 --> 00:11:23.959
Oh, nothing.

00:11:25.627 --> 00:11:27.329
That was me!

00:11:27.429 --> 00:11:29.131
You tin-can turkeys
nearly wiped out

00:11:29.231 --> 00:11:31.166
the evilest genius
in the universe!

00:11:31.266 --> 00:11:32.634
Aah!

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:35.337
- Sorry, Doctor.
- Sorry, Doctor.

00:11:37.539 --> 00:11:39.975
I'll wipe that smirk
off Sonic's face.

00:11:40.075 --> 00:11:42.477
This time I'm not holding back!

00:11:46.214 --> 00:11:46.948
What's that?

00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:48.483
Hang on tight, Chris.

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:50.018
Uh-oh!
Look out!

00:11:50.118 --> 00:11:52.888
This time the doctor
means business.

00:11:54.056 --> 00:11:55.891
[Laughs]

00:11:58.493 --> 00:12:01.396

Aah!

[Laughing]

00:12:13.909 --> 00:12:15.811
Ha-ha!

00:12:20.982 --> 00:12:23.385
We're gonna crash!

00:12:23.485 --> 00:12:25.554
Relax.
We're fine.

00:12:25.687 --> 00:12:27.589
[Laughs]

00:12:29.825 --> 00:12:30.826
They're done for.

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:34.162
No, they're gonna
make it through okay.

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:36.498
There's more coming.

00:12:36.598 --> 00:12:38.366
Well, watch this.

00:12:47.409 --> 00:12:48.543
Yay!

00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:50.312
[Moaning]

[Laughs]

00:12:53.014 --> 00:12:55.417
Pretty cool, huh?

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:57.519
Go, Sonic!

00:12:57.652 --> 00:12:59.020
All right, Sonic!

00:12:59.121 --> 00:13:00.455
Sonic rules!

00:13:00.555 --> 00:13:02.457
All right!
Yay!

00:13:06.561 --> 00:13:09.197
Hey, Sonic, will that work?

00:13:09.297 --> 00:13:10.832
Perfect!

00:13:19.975 --> 00:13:21.743
Ha!

00:13:28.683 --> 00:13:29.718
Whoa!

00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:31.253
EGGMAN:
That's close enough.

00:13:31.353 --> 00:13:33.288
It was a fluke
that you pushed it this far,

00:13:33.388 --> 00:13:36.491
but now your lucky streak
is over.

00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:39.494
Whoa!

00:13:47.602 --> 00:13:49.037
Ha ha ha ha!

00:13:49.137 --> 00:13:50.972
Ha!

00:13:51.072 --> 00:13:52.474
Ready, hedgehog?

00:13:52.574 --> 00:13:55.177
You bet, Dr. E.

00:13:59.214 --> 00:14:00.849
Ha!

00:14:04.286 --> 00:14:07.422
The demolition charges
are all set, ma'am.

00:14:07.556 --> 00:14:08.924
Good work.

00:14:09.024 --> 00:14:10.692
Well, looks like
we're ready, Rouge.

00:14:10.792 --> 00:14:13.962
Hey, where did Rouge go?

00:14:14.429 --> 00:14:16.998
I saw her go that way.

00:14:18.166 --> 00:14:20.702
What in the world
is she doing there?

00:14:21.336 --> 00:14:23.205
Oh...

00:14:23.305 --> 00:14:25.207
Eggman must be keeping
the Chaos Emerald

00:14:25.307 --> 00:14:26.775
someplace else now.

00:14:26.875 --> 00:14:27.976
Hey, Rouge!

00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:29.211
Yeah?

00:14:29.344 --> 00:14:31.346
Get down here!
We've gotta go!

00:14:31.446 --> 00:14:33.248
Go on.
I'll catch up.

00:14:33.381 --> 00:14:34.916
We need you!

00:14:35.016 --> 00:14:38.453
There's something I've got to
take care of first.

00:14:38.553 --> 00:14:41.556
They appear to be working
on opposite sides,

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:43.358
but are any of them
working for us?

00:14:43.458 --> 00:14:45.227
You should lock them all in

00:14:45.327 --> 00:14:47.229
until we can figure out
who is who.

00:14:47.329 --> 00:14:47.929
Good idea.

00:14:48.029 --> 00:14:49.397
Oh!

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:52.867
Uh-oh.
Not good.

00:14:52.968 --> 00:14:55.270
Hey, what are you up to, Rouge?

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:58.873
They locked us in,
but not for long.

00:15:02.744 --> 00:15:03.979

I can't kick through.

00:15:06.615 --> 00:15:09.150
Leave it to me!
Aah!

00:15:11.386 --> 00:15:13.755

00:15:28.203 --> 00:15:31.506
Is there time to defuse
the charge?

- We're not giving up yet!
- He's right.

00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:43.418
Together we have
a fighting chance.

00:15:43.551 --> 00:15:44.419
Ready?

Ugh!

00:16:17.452 --> 00:16:20.255
I've gotten out
of tighter squeezes.

00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:23.625
That's true, but this time,
you've finally met your match.

00:16:23.725 --> 00:16:25.994
Gearheart's the ultimate
combat robot,

00:16:26.094 --> 00:16:28.763
because it's got
the ultimate power supply.

00:16:28.863 --> 00:16:30.765
Two Chaos Emeralds!

00:16:30.865 --> 00:16:32.834
Ugh!

00:16:32.934 --> 00:16:34.269
So that's it.

00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:37.105
I've been looking forward
to this, Sonic.

ROBOT: Sorry to bother you,
but we have a problem.

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:45.680
A group of intruders is locked
in the generator room.

00:16:45.814 --> 00:16:48.316
We are unable to determine
whose side they're on.

00:16:48.416 --> 00:16:49.784
Huh?

00:16:51.453 --> 00:16:53.421
Knuckles!

00:16:54.289 --> 00:16:57.158
Those are our enemies,
you dumb-bot.

00:16:57.258 --> 00:16:59.494
Then we will eliminate them.

00:16:59.594 --> 00:17:02.197
What are they doing in
the generator room anyway?

00:17:02.297 --> 00:17:03.698
I am not certain,

00:17:03.798 --> 00:17:06.201
but they did mention something
about demolition charges.

00:17:06.301 --> 00:17:07.340
They what?!

[Both grunting]

We're running out of time.

00:17:23.633 --> 00:17:26.369
This will be a cinch.

00:17:30.006 --> 00:17:32.074

Get Sonic!

00:17:41.651 --> 00:17:42.551
Run all you want.

00:17:42.652 --> 00:17:44.787

pulverize you.

No, bring them back!

Oh, no!

There's not much time
to get out of here.

We're still locked in.

00:19:03.265 --> 00:19:06.001
Don't worry.
I'll punch us out.

00:19:06.102 --> 00:19:08.237

Get off.
I want to fight, too.

Don't give me orders!

00:19:23.352 --> 00:19:25.020
I'm in charge of this operation.

You follow my lead.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:29.892
Following you is what got us
trapped to start with.

Do you think he made it
out of there okay?

I hope Sonic wasn't still
in there.
