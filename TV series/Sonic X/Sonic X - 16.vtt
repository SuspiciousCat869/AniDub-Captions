Dr. Eggman went head-to-head
with Sonic.

00:00:02.571 --> 00:00:04.773
And the hedgehog hammered
him big-time.

00:00:04.873 --> 00:00:05.941
Did he survive?

00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:07.109
Did he escape?

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:10.145
Where is Dr. Eggman?

00:00:11.213 --> 00:00:13.115
Where is Dr. Eggman?

00:00:13.215 --> 00:00:15.617
I need to know if he survived
the attack on his ship.

00:00:15.717 --> 00:00:17.986
We're searching the area
near the crash site

00:00:18.086 --> 00:00:19.855
to see if there's
any sign of him.

00:00:19.955 --> 00:00:22.257
If we don't track down
that madman soon,

00:00:22.357 --> 00:00:23.625
he's going to strike back.

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:25.127
Find him!

00:00:25.227 --> 00:00:26.762
Right.

00:01:02.798 --> 00:01:03.765
Doctor?

00:01:03.865 --> 00:01:04.866
Quiet!

00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:07.235
Don't make a sound.

00:01:07.335 --> 00:01:10.238
There's a search team up there
listening for us.

00:01:10.338 --> 00:01:13.175
If they hear us, we're done for.

00:01:13.275 --> 00:01:14.843
Sorry.

00:01:23.785 --> 00:01:25.420
[All groan]

[All sigh]

00:01:32.727 --> 00:01:36.198
Now go outside and get this ship
patched up, you lead heads!

00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:38.133
Outside in the water?

00:01:38.233 --> 00:01:39.835
But we will short-circuit.

00:01:39.935 --> 00:01:41.670
Not to mention rust.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.405
Go, go, go, go, go

00:01:43.505 --> 00:01:44.940
Gotta go fast

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.142
Gotta go fast

00:01:47.242 --> 00:01:50.178
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:51.813 --> 00:01:55.250
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.052
Got ourselves a situation

00:01:57.152 --> 00:01:59.354
Stuck in a new location

00:01:59.454 --> 00:02:02.924
Without any explanation

00:02:03.024 --> 00:02:05.026
No talk of relaxation

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.661
Don't, don't, don't

00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:08.463
Don't blink, don't think

00:02:08.563 --> 00:02:10.265
Just go, go, go, go

00:02:10.398 --> 00:02:11.766

Sonic is on the run

00:02:17.372 --> 00:02:19.174
Sonic, he's number one

00:02:19.274 --> 00:02:22.911
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

Are you ready for dessert?

00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:49.804
- Yeah!
- Chao!

00:02:49.904 --> 00:02:51.806
I'm glad you're here.
I have good news.

00:02:51.906 --> 00:02:53.575
What kind of good news, Chuck?

00:02:53.675 --> 00:02:55.777
I'm going to hand out
some official documents

00:02:55.877 --> 00:02:58.580
issued by the government
that you'll need to hang on to.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.315
Documents?

00:03:00.415 --> 00:03:02.817
Yes, to verify your identity.

00:03:02.917 --> 00:03:04.519
But what for?

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:07.389
They'll help you prove who you
are when you travel around.

00:03:07.522 --> 00:03:09.991
And for Tails,
we have special licenses

00:03:10.125 --> 00:03:12.660
that allow him to fly any kind
of aircraft he can build

00:03:12.794 --> 00:03:14.629
to any destination
on the planet.

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:16.431
All these just to fly?

00:03:16.564 --> 00:03:18.366
He never needed them before.

00:03:18.466 --> 00:03:21.369
Well, that's the price Tails
and the others will have to pay

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:23.671
for being made residents
of this place.

00:03:23.772 --> 00:03:25.373
From now on,
they're going to have to follow

00:03:25.473 --> 00:03:29.010
the same rules and regulations
as the rest of us.

00:03:34.082 --> 00:03:36.651
I look terrible!

00:03:37.085 --> 00:03:38.086
Really?

00:03:38.186 --> 00:03:39.921
- You do?
- Let me see.

00:03:40.021 --> 00:03:42.457
Why did they have to use
this picture?

00:03:42.557 --> 00:03:44.259
I look like a lunatic!

00:03:44.392 --> 00:03:45.927
Now, now, Miss Amy.

00:03:46.027 --> 00:03:49.731
I wouldn't say that it makes you
look like a lunatic, exactly.

00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:52.801
It makes me look like an insane,
off-the-wall,

00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:54.702
out-of-control maniac!

00:03:54.803 --> 00:03:56.738
I hate it!

00:03:56.838 --> 00:03:58.406
Hey, there, guys.

00:03:58.506 --> 00:04:00.508
What's all the excitement
about in here?

00:04:00.608 --> 00:04:03.745
Sonic, just in time.
I've got your documents, too.

00:04:03.845 --> 00:04:05.947
Here.
Always keep this with you.

00:04:06.047 --> 00:04:08.049
Huh?
What's this for?

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:09.250
It's a passport

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.253
so you can go wherever you want
whenever you want to.

00:04:12.353 --> 00:04:15.323
Pretty cool.
I do like to travel.

00:04:15.423 --> 00:04:18.726
If I went everywhere I wanted to
go on this whole planet,

00:04:18.827 --> 00:04:23.264
it'd take me [chuckles]

- We'll see you later.
- Chao! Chao!

00:04:33.174 --> 00:04:37.011
Now, you be careful up there.
No funny stuff.

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:41.015
Bye, Grandpa.
I'll see you.

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.284
I'll be waiting.

00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:52.694
X-Tornado, take off!

00:05:08.743 --> 00:05:10.979
Tanaka, go keep an eye on Chris,

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:12.981
but make sure
he doesn't see you.

00:05:13.081 --> 00:05:15.216
Yes, sir.
I will be invisible.

Oh, Amy, are we going to go
somewhere that's sunny?

00:05:29.063 --> 00:05:30.632
Uh-huh.

Look.

00:05:31.766 --> 00:05:33.902
The Grand Blue Sapphire Sea.

00:05:34.002 --> 00:05:35.503
This travel guide says

00:05:35.637 --> 00:05:38.873
it's one of the most beautiful
places on the whole planet.

00:05:39.874 --> 00:05:42.410
I bet the sunsets
are very romantic.

CHRIS:
Hey, Amy. Do you read me?

00:05:44.812 --> 00:05:45.880
Huh?

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.882
Check out the scenery
down there.

00:05:47.982 --> 00:05:49.884
It's really pretty awesome.

00:05:49.984 --> 00:05:51.286
I'm not looking.

00:05:51.386 --> 00:05:53.454
I only care about one thing,

00:05:53.555 --> 00:05:56.824
and that's getting
to the sea A.S.A. P.

00:05:56.925 --> 00:05:58.226
But I'm trying to tell you.

00:05:58.326 --> 00:06:02.931

Sapphire Sea right now!

It's so beautiful!

00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:18.079
Chao! Chao!

00:06:18.179 --> 00:06:23.318
Yeah, I wanna go swim
and go water-skiing, too.

00:06:23.418 --> 00:06:25.119
Let's all go sailing.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.187
Chao!

00:06:26.287 --> 00:06:28.389
Yeah, I can't wait.

Hey, Chris.

00:06:29.724 --> 00:06:30.692
What's wrong?

00:06:30.825 --> 00:06:33.328
Check out the Chaos Emerald.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.865
Could it be another emerald?

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:39.133
Aah!

00:06:39.234 --> 00:06:41.336
Hey, what's going on?

00:06:43.204 --> 00:06:44.205
The same thing happened

00:06:44.305 --> 00:06:48.109
when we were flying over Diamond
Stadium, and that means...

00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:49.744
Since we're flying over water,

00:06:49.844 --> 00:06:52.180
there must be a Chaos Emerald
underwater!

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.681
You're right, Cream.

00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:56.417
Then we have to go find it.

00:06:57.785 --> 00:07:00.121
Hang on!
I see a landing spot.

00:07:00.221 --> 00:07:02.423

Let's try to keep a low profile,
okay, guys?

Hey, isn't that
Sonic the Hedgehog?

Yes, it is him.

00:07:20.475 --> 00:07:22.277

[Breathing heavily]

00:07:43.698 --> 00:07:46.601
We can't escape crowds
no matter where we go.

00:07:46.701 --> 00:07:48.870
Being famous isn't any fun.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.672
I wish we could just blend in
with the crowd,

00:07:50.772 --> 00:07:52.573
but that seems impossible.

00:07:52.674 --> 00:07:54.575
We all stick out too much.

00:07:54.676 --> 00:07:55.910
It was a lot easier

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.446
when we had to hide out
at your house.

00:07:58.546 --> 00:08:01.082
Well, at least we lost
that crowd for a little while.

00:08:01.182 --> 00:08:04.519
Yeah, why don't we all go for
a swim while we have a chance?

Hey!

00:08:06.554 --> 00:08:10.458
Didn't Sonic run here with us?
Where did he go?

00:08:10.591 --> 00:08:14.662
Maybe he decided to go look for
that Chaos Emerald by himself.

00:08:14.796 --> 00:08:17.665
Sonic, where are you?

00:08:17.765 --> 00:08:20.702
Hey, Sonic!

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.906
I wish he didn't always
have to do things on his own.

SONIC:
You talkin' about me?

00:08:28.443 --> 00:08:30.044
So there you are.

for the Chaos Emerald,

not taking it easy.

Hmm.

That Chaos Emerald's
out there somewhere,

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.389
but I can't find it unless
I get to the bottom

00:08:41.522 --> 00:08:42.924
and stay there for a while.

00:08:43.024 --> 00:08:44.425
Huh?

00:08:44.525 --> 00:08:46.160
Hmm.

00:08:46.294 --> 00:08:47.428
So the big problem

00:08:47.562 --> 00:08:50.431
is how to get you an air supply
down there, right?

00:08:50.531 --> 00:08:52.433
Leave it to me.

Now you can get to the emerald.

I hope you're stickin'
the other end in a milkshake.

so you can breathe.

00:09:16.524 --> 00:09:18.059
Just make sure
you don't lose the hose,

00:09:18.192 --> 00:09:19.627
or you'll be in trouble.

00:09:19.727 --> 00:09:21.763
[Muffled]
Yeah, and out of air.

00:09:22.697 --> 00:09:24.599
Okay, I'll give it a shot.

00:09:24.699 --> 00:09:26.667
Good luck, Sonic!

00:09:35.276 --> 00:09:37.311
[Gasps]

00:09:57.265 --> 00:09:59.233
[Gurgling]

00:10:03.004 --> 00:10:04.439
Wah!

00:10:07.074 --> 00:10:08.242
Aah!

00:10:08.342 --> 00:10:09.444
[Laughs]

00:10:11.078 --> 00:10:12.647
Here, this will work.

00:10:12.747 --> 00:10:14.415
You can bring air with you.

00:10:14.515 --> 00:10:16.918
It's a diving bell, see?

00:10:17.018 --> 00:10:20.555
This is the most ding-a-ling
thing I've ever heard of.

00:10:25.293 --> 00:10:27.295
[Panting]

00:10:27.428 --> 00:10:30.198
It's hot in here, but it sure
beats breathing through a hose.

00:10:30.298 --> 00:10:33.201
Only I can't see where
in the water I'm going.

00:10:33.301 --> 00:10:35.203
I wish this thing had a window.

00:10:35.303 --> 00:10:36.304
Whoa!

00:10:36.437 --> 00:10:38.339
Oh, great, I'm stuck!

00:10:38.439 --> 00:10:40.074
This diving bell is useless.

00:10:40.174 --> 00:10:42.777
I can't even ring it
to get help.

00:10:42.877 --> 00:10:44.479
Any more bright ideas?

00:10:44.579 --> 00:10:46.314
We can't give up yet.

00:10:46.414 --> 00:10:48.916
There's got to be some way
to reach that emerald.

00:10:49.016 --> 00:10:50.451
If we're gonna search
underwater,

00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:52.987
the best way to go
is to rent some scuba gear.

00:10:53.087 --> 00:10:55.223
You always need to use
professional equipment

00:10:55.323 --> 00:10:57.892
or else diving
can be really dangerous.

00:10:58.025 --> 00:10:59.927
[Groans]

00:11:03.397 --> 00:11:06.033
We'll need five air tanks,
plus flippers,

00:11:06.133 --> 00:11:07.602
and a pair of goggles for me.

00:11:07.702 --> 00:11:09.303
I should have enough money
with me

00:11:09.403 --> 00:11:12.039
to pay for all the diving
equipment and the boat.

00:11:12.139 --> 00:11:13.975
How much will that
all cost, sir?

00:11:14.075 --> 00:11:16.577
Forget it.
You don't owe me a dime.

00:11:16.677 --> 00:11:19.113
The government sent a notice
to all shop owners

00:11:19.213 --> 00:11:22.316
that it'll cover your bills
as part of its Sonic budget.

00:11:22.416 --> 00:11:24.819
Is there anything else
I can get for you guys?

00:11:24.919 --> 00:11:26.320
Uh...

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.156
It might help if you told me
what you were diving for.

00:11:29.257 --> 00:11:32.059
Uh, we're going to see...

00:11:33.528 --> 00:11:35.496
Wow, this awesome ship model

00:11:35.596 --> 00:11:37.965
is exactly like the one
in that painting, right?

00:11:38.065 --> 00:11:40.902
Uhh. Yeah.
They're the same.

00:11:41.002 --> 00:11:43.838
You see, this ship was lost
at sea a long time ago,

00:11:43.938 --> 00:11:46.173
and there's a legend
that it sank near here

00:11:46.274 --> 00:11:48.376
with a huge load of gold.

00:11:48.476 --> 00:11:51.879
Folks here think
the legend's true.

00:11:53.881 --> 00:11:56.284
Thanks.
Let's get the boat, guys.

00:11:56.384 --> 00:11:59.520
Take care and have fun.

00:12:00.621 --> 00:12:03.291
I hope they find
what they're looking for.

00:12:03.424 --> 00:12:04.425
AMY:
Don't worry, Sonic.

00:12:04.525 --> 00:12:07.094
We'll be with you in case you
get into trouble.

00:12:07.228 --> 00:12:09.263
But we know
you'll do great down there.

00:12:09.397 --> 00:12:12.199
Remember to take long, deep
breaths, and you'll be okay.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.501
Right.

00:12:13.601 --> 00:12:15.503
Then let's go.

00:12:19.574 --> 00:12:21.242
You all set, Sonic?

00:12:21.342 --> 00:12:23.210
Yep.
Let's dive.

00:12:45.562 --> 00:12:47.698
All right, you two, get to work!

00:12:47.798 --> 00:12:49.700
Underwater repairs
are the worst.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.501
My circuits get soaked.

00:12:51.601 --> 00:12:55.372
Now it's time for the SSTV
"Sonic News Update."

00:12:55.472 --> 00:12:57.007
After defeating Dr. Eggman,

00:12:57.107 --> 00:13:00.677
Sonic and his friends are taking
a much-deserved holiday.

00:13:00.777 --> 00:13:01.979
Holiday?!

00:13:02.079 --> 00:13:04.114
He gets a holiday?!

00:13:04.214 --> 00:13:06.984
But Sonic is a goof-off.
We work harder than he does.

00:13:07.084 --> 00:13:09.987
We have never had a day off
since we were activated!

00:13:10.087 --> 00:13:11.288
This is unfair!

00:13:11.421 --> 00:13:13.190
Robots need vacations, too!

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:15.325
[Growling]

00:13:15.459 --> 00:13:18.562
I'll make Sonic pay.

00:13:22.299 --> 00:13:24.468
The Chaos Emerald's
getting brighter.

00:13:24.568 --> 00:13:26.970
We must be getting closer.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:28.672
Hey, look!

00:13:34.578 --> 00:13:36.313
Whoa!

00:13:41.284 --> 00:13:45.589
That must be the ship the guy in
the diving shop told me about.

00:13:45.689 --> 00:13:49.192
It looks like that's where we'll
find the Chaos Emerald, too.

00:13:49.292 --> 00:13:52.796
Then, what are we waiting for?
Let's go check it out.

00:13:58.969 --> 00:14:00.537
Ha!
Gotcha!

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:04.708
[Snoring]

00:14:07.344 --> 00:14:09.546
It's only that squirt, Cheese.

00:14:09.646 --> 00:14:12.849
Sonic's not on the boat,
but he's supposed to be.

00:14:12.983 --> 00:14:15.719
Oh, where could he be?

00:14:18.855 --> 00:14:20.891
[Chuckles] While I'm waiting
to catch Sonic,

00:14:21.024 --> 00:14:23.960
I'll catch a few rays, too.

00:14:24.061 --> 00:14:26.096
[Bokkun laughs]

00:14:26.229 --> 00:14:29.299
Love the bathing suit, Doc.
Did you get that in prison?

00:14:29.399 --> 00:14:33.036
Well, Bokkun, I bet Sonic
was feeling really blue

00:14:33.136 --> 00:14:35.872
after you gave him that message
for me, wasn't he?

00:14:35.972 --> 00:14:37.407
Well.

00:14:37.507 --> 00:14:40.210
Having a nice vacation, Sonic?

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:41.845
I hope you aren't.

00:14:41.945 --> 00:14:44.648
I hope you forget to use
sunscreen and get burnt.

00:14:44.781 --> 00:14:45.749
Wait a...

00:14:45.882 --> 00:14:47.884
This message was supposed to
self-destruct

00:14:47.984 --> 00:14:49.486
after you played it for Sonic.

00:14:49.586 --> 00:14:51.488
Unless you never played it
for him.

00:14:51.621 --> 00:14:54.391
You did play it for him,
Bokkun, didn't you?

00:14:54.524 --> 00:14:56.893
I tried to, Doc,
but nobody was on the boat

00:14:56.993 --> 00:14:58.929
except for
that little cheeseball.

00:14:59.029 --> 00:15:01.965
I'm pretty sure all the others
went diving.

00:15:02.065 --> 00:15:05.502
Now, here's a little souvenir
to remember your vacation by.

00:15:05.602 --> 00:15:06.903
[Laughing evilly]

00:15:07.003 --> 00:15:07.737
Aah!

00:15:07.838 --> 00:15:10.540
You fool, get that thing
away from me!

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.209
It is too late.

00:15:15.312 --> 00:15:17.147
[Growling]

00:15:17.247 --> 00:15:20.417
You won't wreck my plans again,
Sonic.

00:15:20.517 --> 00:15:22.719
I'll wreck you!

00:15:22.853 --> 00:15:24.054
Prepare to submerge.

00:15:24.187 --> 00:15:26.389
I'll bury Sonic at sea.

00:15:28.658 --> 00:15:30.093
Whoa!

00:15:31.261 --> 00:15:32.729
Wow!

00:15:34.931 --> 00:15:36.733
So the legend was true.

00:15:36.833 --> 00:15:38.568
It's amazing.

00:15:38.668 --> 00:15:41.705
Think of how much jewelry you
could make with all this gold.

00:15:41.805 --> 00:15:43.607
This is glowing
at full brightness now.

00:15:43.707 --> 00:15:45.809
I bet the new Chaos Emerald
is buried somewhere

00:15:45.909 --> 00:15:47.110
under all this gold.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:49.312
We'll have to dig through
the treasure to find it.

00:15:49.412 --> 00:15:53.183
Right, but that could
take us forever.

00:15:53.283 --> 00:15:54.484
[All gasp]

00:15:54.584 --> 00:15:56.553
What's that?

00:15:58.188 --> 00:16:00.090
Oh, no way.

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:01.791
He's got the Chaos Emerald.

00:16:01.892 --> 00:16:04.628
You think he'll give it to us?

00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:06.897
Hold it right there.

00:16:06.997 --> 00:16:09.299
We need that Chaos Emerald.

00:16:09.399 --> 00:16:10.867
[Mumbles]

00:16:10.967 --> 00:16:14.371
Drop it, or I'll give you
something to be crabby about.

00:16:14.471 --> 00:16:15.906
[Mumbles]

00:16:20.443 --> 00:16:23.146
This vacation turned out to be
very rewarding.

00:16:23.246 --> 00:16:25.749
We're one emerald closer
to going home!

00:16:25.882 --> 00:16:28.985
DR. EGGMAN:
Your vacation is over, Sonic.

00:16:29.085 --> 00:16:30.987
[Laughing evilly]

00:16:33.723 --> 00:16:36.493
He's going to wish
he never saw the sea.

00:16:36.593 --> 00:16:40.297
Clurken, put the sting
on that hedgehog.

00:16:42.265 --> 00:16:43.767
You guys get back to the boat.

00:16:43.867 --> 00:16:46.436
I can handle Eggman
and this robot myself.

00:16:46.536 --> 00:16:48.772
All right,
but be careful, Sonic.

00:16:48.872 --> 00:16:49.973
Come on, guys.

00:17:04.554 --> 00:17:07.023
Running underwater
is really a drag.

00:17:07.123 --> 00:17:09.292
It's impossible
to move fast here.

00:17:09.392 --> 00:17:10.994
[Laughs]
He should have known

00:17:11.127 --> 00:17:13.763
that water makes
the perfect speed trap.

00:17:18.935 --> 00:17:20.036
[Laughing evilly]

00:17:20.136 --> 00:17:22.297
This time he's all washed up.

00:17:26.208 --> 00:17:27.142
[Sighs]

00:17:27.242 --> 00:17:28.744
Is everybody okay?

00:17:28.844 --> 00:17:30.045
Of course we are.

00:17:30.145 --> 00:17:32.014
[Horn blows]

00:17:32.114 --> 00:17:33.115
Ahoy!

00:17:33.215 --> 00:17:35.117
Ahoy, Master Chris.

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:37.653
I came to rescue you.

00:17:38.253 --> 00:17:39.988
Mr. Tanaka?

00:17:40.889 --> 00:17:42.491
We do not have much time.

00:17:42.591 --> 00:17:44.493
All of you, get aboard, quickly.

00:17:44.593 --> 00:17:46.995
Hold on.
What are you doing here?

00:17:47.095 --> 00:17:49.765
I promised your grandfather
I'd keep you out of trouble,

00:17:49.865 --> 00:17:51.567
and so I followed you all here.

00:17:51.633 --> 00:17:52.901
I saw you needed help

00:17:53.001 --> 00:17:56.438
and came faster than you can say
"dinner is served."

00:17:56.538 --> 00:17:58.941
Uh. Huh.

00:18:05.314 --> 00:18:06.315
Whoa!

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:17.125
Aah!
Aah!

00:18:17.226 --> 00:18:19.494
Hey, get your tentacles
off of me!

00:18:19.595 --> 00:18:22.631
Hey, cut it out!

00:18:22.731 --> 00:18:24.833
Put him down!

00:18:28.704 --> 00:18:30.239
[Laughs]

00:18:30.339 --> 00:18:32.107
Uncle Sam, to the rescue.

00:18:32.207 --> 00:18:33.308
Uncle Sam!

00:18:33.408 --> 00:18:37.379
I heard you might be in a jam,
so I sped right over.

00:18:38.814 --> 00:18:41.683
Grab this and you can ski
your way free.

00:18:41.783 --> 00:18:43.018
Hyah!

00:18:43.151 --> 00:18:45.053
Whoa!

00:18:57.032 --> 00:19:00.502
Come on, you can do better
than that, Eggman!

00:19:02.704 --> 00:19:04.606
TAILS:
Hey, Sonic!

00:19:05.841 --> 00:19:08.243
A ring.
Here, catch.

00:19:15.617 --> 00:19:16.818
[Gasps]

00:19:27.062 --> 00:19:28.463
All right!

00:19:29.731 --> 00:19:30.966
[Chuckles]

00:19:34.903 --> 00:19:36.938
Thanks, Sam.

00:19:37.539 --> 00:19:39.908
MAN:
Whoa, I can't believe it.

00:19:40.008 --> 00:19:42.911
The legend of the sunken ship
is true?

00:19:43.011 --> 00:19:46.915
Yeah, but Eggman's robot came
after us and wrecked the wreck.

00:19:47.015 --> 00:19:48.717
Whatever's left of that ship
and the treasure

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:50.686
got buried on the sea bottom.

00:19:50.786 --> 00:19:53.121
Oh, I see.

00:19:53.221 --> 00:19:56.925
But the ship really did exist.
You saw it.

00:19:57.025 --> 00:19:58.660
Yeah.

00:19:59.795 --> 00:20:02.197
I tried to find that ship
for years.

00:20:02.297 --> 00:20:06.301
Thanks to you, I finally have
proof that it was real.

00:20:06.401 --> 00:20:08.303
[Sighs]

00:20:10.272 --> 00:20:12.007
Then the guy at the diving shop

00:20:12.107 --> 00:20:14.309
told me the most amazing story
of all.

00:20:14.409 --> 00:20:16.144
Turns out his great-grandfather

00:20:16.244 --> 00:20:19.014
was the captain
of that sunken ship we found.

00:20:19.114 --> 00:20:20.582
Wow, cool!

00:20:20.682 --> 00:20:22.651
I'm sure glad we came here.

00:20:22.751 --> 00:20:23.685
Chao! Chao!

00:20:23.785 --> 00:20:27.823
And now that Dr. Eggman's gone,
we can enjoy our vacation.

00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:36.865
Dr. Eggman struck again today
with a new robot,

00:20:36.965 --> 00:20:39.835
but was quickly defeated
by Sonic the Hedgehog.

00:20:39.935 --> 00:20:43.271
Sonic went on to continue
his vacation.

00:20:43.372 --> 00:20:45.273
[Growls]

00:20:45.374 --> 00:20:47.376
Rest while you can, Sonic.

00:20:47.476 --> 00:20:50.078
You're going to need it.
