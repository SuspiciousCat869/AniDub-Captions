WEBVTT

00:00:01.468 --> 00:00:03.971
Oh, this picture has been
a disaster, darling,

00:00:04.071 --> 00:00:05.305
a complete disaster.

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:06.874
We've had to stop shooting

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:09.443
because there's been
torrential rain for days.

00:00:09.543 --> 00:00:11.979
So there's nothing I can do
besides sit and wait.

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:15.449
I don't think I'll be back till
late next week at the earliest,

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:17.417
but I've had time
to go shopping,

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:19.953
and I'm having lots
of wonderful presents sent.

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:21.355
I hope you'll like them.

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:24.858
They're coming on Daddy's jet,
so you should have them tonight.

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:25.826
Thanks, Mom.

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:30.397
Mom, there's something I did
which I'm not supposed to.

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:32.900
Christopher, what happened?
Are you all right?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.535
Yeah, I'm totally fine.

00:00:34.668 --> 00:00:37.804
But remember how you said
I'm not allowed to swim at night

00:00:37.938 --> 00:00:40.440
and how you wanted me to stay
away from the adult pool?

00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:44.177
Did you go swimming in the adult
pool at night by yourself?

00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:46.280
Well, not exactly.

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:50.817
You see, there was this cat
in the pool, and I got it out.

00:00:50.918 --> 00:00:53.754
Oh, you have a big heart,
just like I do.

00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:57.090
Next time, ring for Mr. Tanaka,
and he'll take care of things.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.593
Oh, darling, I must run.
Kiss Mummy goodbye.

00:00:59.693 --> 00:01:01.094
- [Smooches]
- [Smooches]

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:03.330
Ciao, sweetheart.

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:08.268
Take a good look.
I'm a hedgehog, not a cat.

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:12.139
I know.
Please don't be mad.

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:15.809
You see, my mom
wouldn't understand.

00:01:15.943 --> 00:01:17.844
Why wouldn't she?

00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:18.879
Well, first of all,

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.181
she knows I wouldn't risk
diving into a pool

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:23.850
in the middle of the night
to save a little hedgehog.

00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:25.852
Really?

00:01:25.953 --> 00:01:27.688
What else could I say to her?

00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:30.857
I couldn't tell her that I
saved a blue, talking hedgehog.

00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:31.992
That reminds me.

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:34.194
Where and when did you
learn how to talk?

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:36.229
Good question.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.765
Unfortunately, I don't have
a very good answer,

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:39.866
'cause I don't remember.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.969
[Telephone rings]

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:45.238
Hello?

00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:47.874
- Chris, is everything all right?
- Hey, Dad, how are you?

00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:50.077
I'm fine, but your mother
just told me

00:01:50.177 --> 00:01:52.145
you made an emergency rescue
last night.

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:55.015
I guess our security system
can't protect against stray cats

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:57.451
that decide they want to go
for a moonlight swim.

00:01:57.551 --> 00:02:00.053
Chris, I know you like animals,
but what you did was dangerous.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.923
Were you hurt?
Did the cat scratch you?

00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:04.958
Mnh-mnh.
No scratches at all.

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:06.827
I'm fine, Dad.
Honest, I am.

00:02:06.927 --> 00:02:08.929
It really wasn't
that big a deal.

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:11.498
After I jumped in
and got it out of the water,

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:13.867
it was really happy.
I could tell.

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:14.901
Yeah, gotcha, yeah.

00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:18.472
Besides, I could have had
Grandpa or Ella or Mr. Tanaka

00:02:18.572 --> 00:02:20.374
to help me if I needed to.

00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:23.677
Don't worry, Dad.
They're taking good care of me.

00:02:23.777 --> 00:02:24.745
Yeah, they better be.

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:27.481
Listen, Chris, I've got
an important meeting to run to.

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:29.483
You call me anytime
you need anything,

00:02:29.583 --> 00:02:31.485
and no more
late-night swims, promise?

00:02:31.585 --> 00:02:35.389
Okay, Dad, I promise.
See you soon.

00:02:37.057 --> 00:02:38.458
[Sighs]

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:41.628
[Chuckles nervously]

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:44.031
I almost forgot.
You must be pretty hungry.

00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:46.967
I was thinking you might like
to have something to eat.

00:02:47.067 --> 00:02:49.269
Yeah, I guess I could go
for something.

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:50.937
What's on the menu?

00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:53.173
I checked out hedgehogs
on the Internet

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:55.676
and found the perfect thing.

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:00.781
What is this?!

00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:02.783
Cat food.

00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:05.786
Blah! No wonder.
Tastes like there's cat in it.

00:03:05.886 --> 00:03:09.923
The website I went to said
most hedgehogs love cat food.

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:12.526
I guess that doesn't go
for all hedgehogs.

00:03:12.626 --> 00:03:14.995
I can get you a bowl
of crickets.

00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:20.434
No!
Please don't run away.

00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:23.637
Sorry, kid, but crickets
don't do it for me.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.673
I'll get whatever you want,
but just don't go!

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:29.676
Huh!
See ya!

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:30.811
Come back!

00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:34.181
Sonic, you could get hurt
out there!

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.687
Go, go, go, go, go

00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:42.222
Gotta go fast

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:44.424
Gotta go fast

00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:47.461
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:03:49.096 --> 00:03:52.532
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:54.301
Got ourselves a situation

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.603
Stuck in a new location

00:03:56.737 --> 00:04:00.173
Without any explanation

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:02.275
No talk of relaxation

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:03.910
Don't, don't, don't

00:04:04.044 --> 00:04:05.679
Don't blink, don't think

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:07.547
Just go, go, go, go

00:04:07.647 --> 00:04:09.015
Go, go

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.554
Sonic is on the run

00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:16.456
Sonic, he's number one

00:04:16.556 --> 00:04:20.193
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:04:20.293 --> 00:04:21.695
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:23.697
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:04:23.797 --> 00:04:26.266
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:28.135
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.504
Sonic X

00:04:30.637 --> 00:04:33.373
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:35.408
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:37.277
Sonic X

00:04:41.496 --> 00:04:44.666
The supersonic speed demon seen
here on police helicopter video

00:04:44.766 --> 00:04:46.234
has the city baffled.

00:04:46.334 --> 00:04:47.669
It was about this high.

00:04:47.769 --> 00:04:50.004
It was blue,
and it looked like a freak.

00:04:50.105 --> 00:04:54.042
I was doing about 60 when
this thing went right by me.

00:04:54.142 --> 00:04:56.745
That thing moved too fast
to be a regular animal.

00:04:56.845 --> 00:04:59.781
As to the question of whether
this is a U. M.A.

00:04:59.881 --> 00:05:02.951
Unidentified Mutant Animal.
It is positively not.

00:05:03.051 --> 00:05:05.420
Even the cheetah, which is
widely believed to be

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.255
the fastest member
of the animal kingdom,

00:05:07.388 --> 00:05:10.225
cannot outrun a
speeding Formula 1 police car.

00:05:10.325 --> 00:05:12.527
Because of this,
the inescapable conclusion

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.530
one must inevitably come to is
that this so-called hedgehog

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.866
is in reality a machine.

00:05:22.637 --> 00:05:24.405
There you are.
Guess what?

00:05:24.506 --> 00:05:26.941
A big, blue hedgehog
came out of nowhere

00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:29.577
and outran the S-Team yesterday.

00:05:33.047 --> 00:05:34.582
Aah!

00:05:34.682 --> 00:05:38.186
[Muffled] Hey! Cut it out!
I can't breathe!

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:39.788
Uhh!

00:05:39.888 --> 00:05:41.322
Hmm.

00:05:42.157 --> 00:05:43.525
Blue.

00:05:43.625 --> 00:05:45.593
Just like that...

00:05:45.693 --> 00:05:48.163
[Gasps]

00:05:48.797 --> 00:05:49.931
It's him!

00:05:50.031 --> 00:05:52.400
Easy, Grandpa!

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.669
Grandpa, what are you doing?!

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:57.438
I have to see how this thing
is put together.

00:06:00.675 --> 00:06:02.377
Stand still!

00:06:02.477 --> 00:06:05.380
Grandpa, wait.
He's not a machine.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.315
He's Sonic the Hedgehog.

00:06:07.415 --> 00:06:09.751
Ahh.

00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:14.222
WOMAN ON TV: Now let's go live
to this late-breaking story.

00:06:14.322 --> 00:06:17.692
[Whimpering]
Oh, please!

00:06:19.327 --> 00:06:21.696
Please, leave us alone!

00:06:21.796 --> 00:06:23.398
It's Cream and Cheese.

00:06:23.498 --> 00:06:24.999
It's who?

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:26.734
I'm not the only one
who got transported

00:06:26.835 --> 00:06:28.503
into this weird world after all.

00:06:28.603 --> 00:06:30.705
I'll save those two.

00:06:34.242 --> 00:06:36.678
Do you know where they are?

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:54.429
I thought they'd do something
along those lines.

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:56.397
Well, thanks for giving me
the scoop,

00:06:56.497 --> 00:06:58.099
and I'll talk to you soon.

00:06:59.033 --> 00:07:01.836
Well, Sonic's friends
have been captured by the police

00:07:02.003 --> 00:07:03.571
and moved to Area 99.

00:07:03.671 --> 00:07:06.241
Area 99?

00:07:06.341 --> 00:07:09.477
That's that top-secret
military base.

00:07:09.577 --> 00:07:11.279
What?

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:14.115
It's where the National Defense
Force keeps their tanks,

00:07:14.215 --> 00:07:16.251
fighter jets,
and high-tech spy equipment.

00:07:16.351 --> 00:07:18.887
That sounds like Eggman's
kind of place.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.155
Your friends have been taken
there by the army

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:23.024
and placed under 24-hour guard.

00:07:23.124 --> 00:07:25.560
The authorities believe
they could be aliens

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.896
or perhaps members
of a mutant species

00:07:27.996 --> 00:07:29.364
developed by an enemy power

00:07:29.464 --> 00:07:31.366
designed to attack
our population.

00:07:31.466 --> 00:07:34.535
I wonder if they might
not be right, Sonic, eh?

00:07:34.636 --> 00:07:36.671
Think what you want.
I'm gone.

00:07:36.771 --> 00:07:40.041
Now that I know where
my friends are, I'm outta here.

00:07:40.141 --> 00:07:43.544
But if you show up at Area 99,
they'll lock you up, too.

00:07:43.645 --> 00:07:45.747
They can't lock me up.

00:07:45.847 --> 00:07:47.215
Whoa!

00:07:48.116 --> 00:07:49.284
Open that door.

00:07:49.384 --> 00:07:51.319
Don't look at me.
I didn't do it.

00:07:51.419 --> 00:07:52.754
It was me.

00:07:52.887 --> 00:07:54.255
Huh?

00:07:54.389 --> 00:07:56.124
You're gonna need
some help, Sonic.

00:07:56.224 --> 00:07:57.592
I'll go with you.

00:07:57.692 --> 00:07:59.761
Grandpa, are you serious?

00:07:59.894 --> 00:08:02.864
Of course I'm serious,
and you're coming along, too.

00:08:02.997 --> 00:08:05.633
You told me you don't want to
lead a boring life,

00:08:05.733 --> 00:08:07.302
so here's your chance
for excitement.

00:08:07.402 --> 00:08:09.804
Well, if you're up for it,
I'm up for it.

00:08:09.904 --> 00:08:11.072
Just don't tell Dad.

00:08:11.172 --> 00:08:13.541
All right!
Let's get going.

00:08:18.913 --> 00:08:20.648
It's gonna take forever
to get there.

00:08:20.748 --> 00:08:22.317
I'd rather just go by myself.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:24.018
Chill out.

00:08:24.118 --> 00:08:25.153
Is it time?

00:08:25.286 --> 00:08:27.221
It's time.

00:08:28.523 --> 00:08:29.257
Put it on.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:30.525
What's this?

00:08:30.625 --> 00:08:32.260
An infrared scope.

00:08:32.393 --> 00:08:35.863
I'm certain that Area 99 is full
of infrared motion detectors

00:08:35.997 --> 00:08:37.865
that set off security alarms.

00:08:37.966 --> 00:08:40.935
If you wear that,
you may be able to avoid them.

00:08:41.035 --> 00:08:42.670
Mm-hmm.

00:08:45.873 --> 00:08:47.775
See ya later, guys.

00:08:50.778 --> 00:08:54.182
He certainly is a speedy
little critter, isn't he?

00:08:54.282 --> 00:08:56.351
Yeah!

00:09:41.062 --> 00:09:48.102
Identification number F219563
confirmed.

00:10:00.014 --> 00:10:03.017
We didn't do anything.
Please let us out.

00:10:03.117 --> 00:10:04.385
[Gasps]

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.755
What kind of place is this?

00:10:07.889 --> 00:10:10.625
Cheese, we've got to get
out of here.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.268
Sonic, can you hear me?

00:10:20.368 --> 00:10:21.936
Yeah.

00:10:22.036 --> 00:10:23.671
Remember, when you get
to the main building,

00:10:23.771 --> 00:10:25.139
go in through an air vent.

00:10:25.239 --> 00:10:27.508
That should be a blind spot
for security.

00:10:27.608 --> 00:10:29.410
- Got it?
- Got it.

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:31.512
But, Grandpa,
after he gets inside,

00:10:31.612 --> 00:10:33.815
how will he find
where his friends are?

00:10:33.915 --> 00:10:36.484
Give me that!
Listen to me, Sonic.

00:10:36.617 --> 00:10:38.453
Once you get inside,
you won't have much time,

00:10:38.553 --> 00:10:40.288
so think quickly
and act quickly.

00:10:40.421 --> 00:10:42.490
Grandpa, what if he doesn't?

00:10:42.623 --> 00:10:45.226
Thanks for the tip.
I'm going in.

00:10:52.233 --> 00:10:55.470
Intruder alert, Sector "D."

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.372
Intruder alert, Sector "D."

00:10:59.674 --> 00:11:01.008
Ha ha ha!
Oh!

00:11:06.047 --> 00:11:07.715
I'm inside the air vent.

00:11:07.815 --> 00:11:09.584
Be careful.

00:11:09.684 --> 00:11:12.720
[Groans]

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:16.124
It feels like I have
skid marks on my butt.

00:11:16.657 --> 00:11:18.226
Oh?

00:11:21.863 --> 00:11:23.998
How's it look in there, Sonic?

00:11:24.098 --> 00:11:25.500
Just great.

00:11:31.172 --> 00:11:33.841
This'll be a piece of cake.

00:11:33.941 --> 00:11:35.009
[Grunts]

00:11:46.521 --> 00:11:48.923
I'm too fast for 'em.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.794
Heads up.

00:11:59.804 --> 00:12:02.006
Searching for intruder.

00:12:02.107 --> 00:12:04.142
Searching for intruder.

00:12:04.242 --> 00:12:06.144
Searching for intruder.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.762
I wonder if he's okay.

00:12:36.808 --> 00:12:38.443
[Whimpering]

00:12:45.884 --> 00:12:47.719
[All gasp]

00:12:49.487 --> 00:12:52.457
- I don't like this.
- Chao!

00:12:57.328 --> 00:12:59.864
[Thinking] Hmm,
maybe that's where they are.

00:12:59.998 --> 00:13:02.433
I have to get inside
and check it out.

00:13:02.534 --> 00:13:03.735
This won't be easy.

00:13:03.835 --> 00:13:06.371
If it was just me,
I could get out quick,

00:13:06.471 --> 00:13:08.907
but if I have to bring
Cream and Cheese with me,

00:13:09.007 --> 00:13:11.409
I can't get too reckless.

00:13:13.845 --> 00:13:17.849
Abnormality detected
in the electrical system.

00:13:17.949 --> 00:13:21.252
Abnormality detected
in the electrical system.

00:13:24.856 --> 00:13:26.257
Aw, great.

00:13:26.391 --> 00:13:29.260
Now we can't see anything!

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.628
- [Glass breaks]
- What the...

00:13:30.728 --> 00:13:32.330
Hey, where'd they go?

00:13:34.933 --> 00:13:36.668
- Soni...
- Shh!

00:13:36.768 --> 00:13:38.536
Chao! Chao! Chao! Chao!

00:13:38.636 --> 00:13:40.338
[Laughs]

00:13:40.438 --> 00:13:42.574
Over there!

00:13:42.674 --> 00:13:44.642
- Let's go.
- Right.

00:13:50.982 --> 00:13:53.418
What are these things?

00:13:55.954 --> 00:13:59.157
[Gasps] Somebody has
sabotaged the whole system.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:03.194
Boys, let's move it.
We need the power back now.

00:14:09.801 --> 00:14:10.268
Wow, Sonic.

00:14:10.368 --> 00:14:12.704
How did you shut off
all the electricity?

00:14:12.804 --> 00:14:16.140
I didn't do it, Cream.
I guess it just happened.

00:14:16.241 --> 00:14:18.109
Maybe it just happened

00:14:18.209 --> 00:14:21.312
because you bring good luck
everywhere you go, Sonic.

00:14:21.412 --> 00:14:23.615
You might be right.

00:14:23.715 --> 00:14:25.083
- [Gasps]
- Chao!

00:14:30.288 --> 00:14:33.191
I shouldn't have said anything.
I must be a jinx.

00:14:33.291 --> 00:14:35.226
This isn't your fault.

00:14:37.762 --> 00:14:39.497
Cream, hang on!

00:14:39.597 --> 00:14:41.499
Right.
Aah!

00:14:49.307 --> 00:14:52.610
[Alarm blaring]

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:53.878
Sonic, what's going on?

00:14:53.978 --> 00:14:56.347
Are you and your
friends all right?

00:14:57.215 --> 00:14:59.050
Not exactly.

00:15:00.718 --> 00:15:02.820
- Sonic!
- Run!

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:22.073
Keep running!

00:15:23.174 --> 00:15:24.575
Right.

00:15:25.343 --> 00:15:28.212
D-2 area lockdown in progress.

00:15:32.483 --> 00:15:35.019
The door.
We can't make it out!

00:15:50.068 --> 00:15:52.704
Hey, what are they?

00:16:02.747 --> 00:16:04.949
I don't understand.
What's going on?

00:16:05.083 --> 00:16:07.518
We can't stick around
to find out.

00:16:10.855 --> 00:16:14.125
Facility lockdown in progress.

00:16:14.225 --> 00:16:17.662
Facility lockdown in progress.

00:16:17.795 --> 00:16:20.365
[Voice slows]
Facility lockdown in prog...

00:16:20.465 --> 00:16:21.466
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:16:29.073 --> 00:16:32.710
The laser surveillance cameras
are out of control!

00:16:38.182 --> 00:16:40.318
Sonic, are we going
to make it out?

00:16:40.418 --> 00:16:42.587
Don't worry.
We'll make it!

00:16:44.922 --> 00:16:45.556
Aah!

00:16:50.695 --> 00:16:52.597
[Whimpering]

00:17:14.285 --> 00:17:15.420
See, Cream?

00:17:15.553 --> 00:17:17.555
I told you we'd make it,
and we did.

00:17:17.688 --> 00:17:19.190
You didn't doubt me, did you?

00:17:19.323 --> 00:17:20.725
Mnh-mnh.

00:17:20.825 --> 00:17:22.960
Thank you for saving us.

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.830
Ah, anytime, Cream.
Anytime.

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:27.432
- Huh?
- [Whirring]

00:17:27.532 --> 00:17:29.600
Hey, what's that?

00:17:30.835 --> 00:17:31.969
Huh?

00:17:35.339 --> 00:17:37.942
Sounds like a plane.

00:17:38.042 --> 00:17:39.944
The Tornado!

00:17:44.348 --> 00:17:47.251
This must be the place.

00:17:49.854 --> 00:17:52.290
All right, Sonic!

00:18:01.098 --> 00:18:02.366
Hey!

00:18:02.467 --> 00:18:03.901
Ha ha!

00:18:04.001 --> 00:18:05.503
It was you.

00:18:05.603 --> 00:18:08.639
You're the one who helped us
get out of there.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.910
I helped,
but Sonic's the real hero.

00:18:19.383 --> 00:18:21.486
Well, Chris,
mission accomplished.

00:18:21.619 --> 00:18:23.654
Let's head for home.

00:18:31.496 --> 00:18:33.231
My name's Christopher.

00:18:33.331 --> 00:18:35.299
Sonic landed
in our pool last night,

00:18:35.399 --> 00:18:36.901
and I dove in and saved him.

00:18:37.001 --> 00:18:41.005
My name's Tails,
and I'm Sonic's very best buddy.

00:18:41.105 --> 00:18:42.273
Right, Sonic?

00:18:42.373 --> 00:18:44.375
Correct.

00:18:44.475 --> 00:18:45.610
My name is Cream,

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:48.779
and this is my very special
Chao friend, Cheese.

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.715
Thanks for helping us.

00:18:50.848 --> 00:18:53.184
It's very nice
to meet all of you.

00:18:53.284 --> 00:18:56.254
I have a feeling we're all gonna
become really good friends.

00:18:56.354 --> 00:18:58.623
Oh, and this is my grandfather.

00:18:58.723 --> 00:19:00.191
Extraordinary.

00:19:00.324 --> 00:19:02.793
Tiny,
radio-controlled airplanes.

00:19:02.927 --> 00:19:04.462
Extraordinary.

00:19:05.062 --> 00:19:08.199
We've got lots of neat gadgets.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.737
Listen, Sonic, this isn't some
game we're playing, you know.

00:19:12.837 --> 00:19:15.473
You could have gotten us
all thrown in jail.

00:19:15.573 --> 00:19:18.476
Maybe I could've,
but I didn't, did I?

00:19:18.576 --> 00:19:20.978
Couldn't you try
to be more careful?

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.815
This is an amazing piece
of equipment.

00:19:24.949 --> 00:19:27.285
It goes beyond anything
I've ever seen.

00:19:27.385 --> 00:19:29.020
How did you develop it?

00:19:29.153 --> 00:19:32.990
It's nothing special,
not in the world we come from.

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:35.993
And where exactly
is that world, Tails?

00:19:36.093 --> 00:19:37.628
Beats me.

00:19:37.728 --> 00:19:41.999
But I think we got here through
a warp in time and space.

00:19:42.099 --> 00:19:43.467
Hmm.

00:19:43.568 --> 00:19:45.069
Very interesting.

00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:47.471
Not very helpful,
but interesting.

00:19:47.572 --> 00:19:49.840
[Chuckles]

00:19:49.941 --> 00:19:51.676
I just thought of something.

00:19:51.776 --> 00:19:54.145
If you and me
and Cream and Cheese are here,

00:19:54.278 --> 00:19:56.113
maybe the others got here, too.

00:19:56.213 --> 00:19:58.249
You might be right
about that, Tails,

00:19:58.382 --> 00:20:02.587
and if you are,
that means maybe...

00:20:04.922 --> 00:20:07.391
BOTH:
Eggman's here, too.

00:20:23.407 --> 00:20:25.009
So...

00:20:25.109 --> 00:20:29.947
we were transported into
this world by Chaos Control.

00:20:30.514 --> 00:20:32.249
Very well, then.

00:20:32.383 --> 00:20:35.920
I'll rebuild the foundation
of the Eggman Empire here,

00:20:36.053 --> 00:20:38.956
and soon,
I'll rule the entire universe.

00:20:39.056 --> 00:20:41.826
[Laughs evilly]
