Hey, what is all this stuff, Suzy?

Apparently, our home appliance

This can't be!

Sonic's fame seems to be reaching
astonishing proportions.

00:03:07.017 --> 00:03:08.919
In fact, a large number of citizens

to do with those complaints, Suzy?

are wild about Sonic, too.

Mm-hmm.

00:03:31.808 --> 00:03:33.443
Well, some of them
have left the company

00:03:33.443 --> 00:03:35.045
and started Sonic fan clubs,

00:03:35.045 --> 00:03:36.980
and most of the
assembly line workers

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.682
spend so much time
talking about Sonic

00:03:38.682 --> 00:03:40.317
that their work has become shoddy.

I just thought you should know that
I kept Chris home from school today

00:04:00.904 --> 00:04:03.373
because he has a
snuffle in his nose.

00:04:03.373 --> 00:04:06.309
It's no big deal, Dad.
I'm totally fine.

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:08.612
I'm giving him plenty
of fresh orange juice,

00:04:08.612 --> 00:04:10.180
and he'll have a
nice big bowl of my

If he gets some rest, I'm sure
he'll be better in a day or so.

00:08:26.269 --> 00:08:28.204
I heard you were sick,
so I rushed right ho-

00:08:28.204 --> 00:08:30.173
- I'm here, baby!

00:08:30.173 --> 00:08:32.242
[Kissing]

00:08:32.242 --> 00:08:34.310
Don't you think
you're overreacting?

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:36.045
It's just a common cold.

00:08:36.045 --> 00:08:37.247
Everyone gets them.

00:08:37.247 --> 00:08:38.248
Yes, I know,

00:08:38.248 --> 00:08:40.817
but when I heard, I just couldn't
keep my mind on my work.

00:08:40.817 --> 00:08:41.985
Same here.

00:08:41.985 --> 00:08:44.454
Nelson!

00:08:44.454 --> 00:08:46.256
You're impossible!

00:08:46.256 --> 00:08:47.524
Don't you see?

00:08:47.524 --> 00:08:49.726
What kind of example are
you giving your son,

00:08:49.726 --> 00:08:51.027
abandoning your workplace

00:08:51.027 --> 00:08:52.929
just because of a
harmless little cold?

00:08:52.929 --> 00:08:53.997
But, Dad, I just wanted-

00:08:53.997 --> 00:08:56.866
Don't you "but Dad" me,
Mr. Big Shot Goof-Off!

00:08:56.866 --> 00:08:59.435
How irresponsible can you get?

00:08:59.969 --> 00:09:01.905
Now listen here, Dad!

00:09:01.905 --> 00:09:05.141
If I wanna take a day off to visit
my son when he's got a disease,

00:09:05.141 --> 00:09:06.743
it's nobody's business but mine!

00:09:06.743 --> 00:09:09.646
If I were you, I couldn't
afford to take time off!

00:09:09.646 --> 00:09:11.481
Not when every product you make

00:09:11.481 --> 00:09:14.184
rolls off the assembly line
straight into the junk shop!

00:09:14.184 --> 00:09:16.419
I'll have you know the real reason
behind those bad appliances

00:09:16.419 --> 00:09:18.021
is your friend Sonic!

00:09:18.021 --> 00:09:20.557
How dare you put
the blame on Sonic!

00:09:20.557 --> 00:09:23.026
Can't you even take responsibility
for your own incompetence?

00:09:23.026 --> 00:09:25.328
Everybody stop yelling!

00:09:25.328 --> 00:09:26.296
Huh?

00:09:26.296 --> 00:09:27.931
Darling!

00:09:27.931 --> 00:09:29.866
Sorry about that, big guy.

00:09:29.866 --> 00:09:32.001
Guess we got a little
carried away there.

00:09:32.001 --> 00:09:35.438
Is this what you came
home for, to argue?

00:09:35.438 --> 00:09:38.575
If you care about me, you have
a funny way of showing it!

00:09:38.575 --> 00:09:40.109
Sorry.

00:09:44.314 --> 00:10:02.198
[Squeaking]

00:10:04.701 --> 00:10:06.236
Chris didn't mean what he said.

00:10:06.236 --> 00:10:09.172
It's just a reaction
to the anti-bionics.

00:10:09.172 --> 00:10:12.075
Ah, I just had the
most wonderful idea!

00:10:12.075 --> 00:10:14.010
I'll make his favorite cherry pie!

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:17.180
One big bite of that, and he'll
be smiling from ear to ear!

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.716
How marvelous! A pie!

00:10:19.716 --> 00:10:23.019
Let's all pitch in and
make it together, huh?

00:10:23.019 --> 00:10:23.920
Hmph!

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.121
Chao!

00:10:29.892 --> 00:10:32.328
All right, everybody,
let's get started.

00:10:32.328 --> 00:10:33.196
Let's.

00:10:33.196 --> 00:10:35.965
It looks like we've got
everything we need.

00:10:35.965 --> 00:10:38.468
Everything except the cherries.

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:44.440
[Struggling]

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.575
It won't budge.

00:10:45.575 --> 00:10:47.176
That's strange.

Now that's what I call mixin it up!

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.442
I just beat the beater.

00:11:20.443 --> 00:11:22.145

on just in time,

Well, the water supply system
itself has been restored,

but I'm afraid something must
be jamming the main sluice gate,

and whatever it is, is
blocking the flow of water.

Is there any way you can fix it?

it's not going to be easy.

the main supply system,

but there seems to be something
in the way of the sluice gate,

00:17:20.543 --> 00:17:22.178
so the water isn't getting out.

00:17:22.178 --> 00:17:24.714
We've got to get that
gate open and fast.

00:17:50.106 --> 00:17:52.108
Sure, it's okay!

00:17:54.577 --> 00:17:58.081
[Grunt]

00:17:58.081 --> 00:17:59.048
[Chuckle]

00:17:59.048 --> 00:18:03.086
When battling a washing machine,
one can't be wishy-washy!

00:18:03.086 --> 00:18:05.855
My, these modern
household conveniences

00:18:05.855 --> 00:18:08.791
certainly are inconvenient,
aren't they, Sonic?

00:18:08.791 --> 00:18:10.827
[Sinister laughter]

00:18:10.827 --> 00:18:11.794
Hey, Bocoe!

00:18:11.794 --> 00:18:14.097
They sure do look
worn out, don't they?

00:18:14.097 --> 00:18:15.498
You could say that again.

00:18:15.498 --> 00:18:17.634
A part of me feels bad for them.

00:18:17.634 --> 00:18:20.236
But I could always have that
part removed, I suppose.

00:18:20.236 --> 00:18:21.504
Wow! just look at 'em!

00:18:21.504 --> 00:18:23.373
They're really mangling
those machines!

00:18:23.373 --> 00:18:25.308
Man, I'm runnin' out of steam!

00:18:25.308 --> 00:18:27.911
I can't keep this up much longer.

00:18:27.911 --> 00:18:28.878
[Grunting]

00:18:42.025 --> 00:18:43.059
Listen up!

00:18:43.059 --> 00:18:45.328
The main sluice gate's
been destroyed for good,

00:18:45.328 --> 00:18:47.897
which means our only choice
is to open up this valve.

00:18:47.897 --> 00:18:50.633
All right, now everybody
get into position.

00:18:54.504 --> 00:18:59.676
[Teeth gritted in concentation]

00:18:59.676 --> 00:19:01.177
[Struggling]

00:19:01.177 --> 00:19:03.046
[Groaning]

00:19:05.615 --> 00:19:06.649
Here comes Dad!

00:19:12.121 --> 00:19:15.158
What are you doing here, son?
Shouldn't you be at home in bed?

00:19:15.158 --> 00:19:18.761
I had to come and help.
It's my responsibility.

00:19:19.162 --> 00:19:20.863
That's my boy.

00:19:20.863 --> 00:19:22.832
We've got work to do, darling!

00:19:22.832 --> 00:19:23.866
Right!

00:19:23.866 --> 00:19:27.437
[Groaning]

00:19:28.972 --> 00:19:32.108
[Grunting]

00:19:50.493 --> 00:19:52.462
We did it, we did it!

00:19:52.462 --> 00:19:53.596
Good job, dear!

00:19:53.596 --> 00:19:54.597
Oh, darling!

00:19:55.565 --> 00:19:56.666
[Giggling]

00:19:56.666 --> 00:19:57.533
Yeah!

00:19:58.201 --> 00:19:59.002
[Grunting]

00:19:59.002 --> 00:19:59.469
[Electricity crackles]

00:19:59.469 --> 00:20:00.436
[Grunting]

00:20:01.537 --> 00:20:02.505
[Grunting]

00:20:02.505 --> 00:20:04.073
[Electricity crackles]

00:20:09.512 --> 00:20:10.880
[Electricity crackles]

00:20:12.682 --> 00:20:14.450
Well, I guess that does it.

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:15.151
Yeah!

00:20:15.151 --> 00:20:15.985
Impossible!

00:20:15.985 --> 00:20:18.655
I could have sworn we cut
off the water supply!

00:20:18.655 --> 00:20:20.823
Someone must have turned
it back on, Doctor!

00:20:20.823 --> 00:20:23.359
Looks like your plan
is a washout, Doctor!

00:20:23.359 --> 00:20:27.163
And just when we were this close
to stopping Sonic once and for all!

00:20:27.163 --> 00:20:30.533
I thought he was a goner, but
he sure showed us, didn't he?

00:20:30.533 --> 00:20:31.834
Well, what is the plan?

00:20:31.834 --> 00:20:33.836
Yeah, Doctor, what do we do now?

00:20:33.836 --> 00:20:35.705
On to the next strategy!

00:20:35.705 --> 00:20:37.307
Aah! Aah!

00:20:37.307 --> 00:20:39.075
Hey, wait for me, will you?

00:20:39.075 --> 00:20:41.177
Come on, you guys! Wait up!

00:20:44.447 --> 00:20:45.982
Well, what do we do now?

00:20:45.982 --> 00:20:50.119
We've got a city full of defective
dishwashers and mashed-up microwaves.

00:20:50.119 --> 00:20:53.122
If I stay on the job, cleanup
should be a piece of cake!

00:20:53.122 --> 00:20:54.390
How about pie?

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:58.561
[Everyone laughing]
