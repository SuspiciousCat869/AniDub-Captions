00:00:00.434 --> 00:00:01.935
Last time on Sonic X,

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:04.271
As our friends plan to greet
the new year's sunrise,

00:00:04.271 --> 00:00:06.573
they were totally shocked
by a total eclipse.

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:08.775
Soon, Dr. Eggman shed
light on the mystery.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:11.945
The malfunctioning Egg Moon was
causing the super sun block.

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:14.314
He begged the president to
let him lighten things up,

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:18.385
and he built giant mirror towers to
power specially designed Sunshine Balls.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.487
But just as Eggman was
being hailed as a hero,

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:22.756
someone started
toppling the towers.

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:24.091
That someone was Sonic.

00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:26.627
And now the citizens are
dead set on stopping him.

00:00:26.627 --> 00:00:27.961
Has Sonic gone screwy?

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:30.063
Find out next on Sonic X!

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.765
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:34.835
Gotta go fast

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.771
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

Got ourselves a situation

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.714
Stuck in a new location

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:51.318
Without any explanation

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.387
No talk of relaxation

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.022
Don't, don't, don't

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:56.823
Don't blink, don't think

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:58.625
Just go, go, go, go

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.127
Go, go

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:05.666
Sonic is on the run

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.534
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:11.271
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

[Worried cries]

00:01:42.775 --> 00:01:44.343
Where's Sonic?

00:01:44.343 --> 00:01:45.911
[Commotion]

00:01:45.911 --> 00:01:48.147
He's not here, so go away.

00:01:48.147 --> 00:01:50.149
Then tell us where he is.

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.052
We know you think he
knocked those towers over.

00:01:53.052 --> 00:01:54.887
But he'd never do that.

00:01:54.887 --> 00:01:57.790
Yeah! Don't forget,
Sonic's on our side!

00:01:58.758 --> 00:02:00.693
At least I think he is.

00:02:00.693 --> 00:02:03.162
The only one Sonic is against is...

00:02:03.162 --> 00:02:04.597
Dr. Eggman!

00:02:04.597 --> 00:02:07.166
He'd do anything to beat Eggman!

00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:08.401
Yeah, right!

00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:10.069
He's just trying to protect him!

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.370
Let's get him!

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.738
[Angry mob]

00:02:12.738 --> 00:02:14.974
All right! Back off!

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:17.376
Amy!

00:02:17.376 --> 00:02:19.879
[Yelling]

00:02:22.515 --> 00:02:23.382
Go!

00:02:23.382 --> 00:02:25.718
[All panting]

00:02:25.718 --> 00:02:27.320
Woah!

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.073
All right, everybody. Listen up!

00:02:47.073 --> 00:02:50.042
If any one of you yahoos
lays a finger on them,

00:02:50.042 --> 00:02:51.510
you'll have to deal with me.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.146
Uh...? Uh...

00:02:54.146 --> 00:02:55.614
[Sighs of relief]

00:02:55.614 --> 00:02:57.049
They're leaving.

00:02:59.385 --> 00:03:02.455
Ah, goodness. That was
certainly a close shave.

00:03:02.455 --> 00:03:05.057
Looks like the S-Team
showed up just in team.

00:03:06.158 --> 00:03:08.094
You doing okay, buddy?

00:03:08.094 --> 00:03:09.528
Yeah...

00:03:10.062 --> 00:03:11.664
Oh, Sonic...

00:03:11.664 --> 00:03:13.399
It can't be true...

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:14.900
It just can't be!

00:03:19.905 --> 00:03:22.208
Here goes another one!

00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:26.679
All right!

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:27.713
Bullseye!

00:03:27.713 --> 00:03:29.482
I'm warning you, Mr. President.

00:03:29.482 --> 00:03:31.584
Sonic will stop at
nothing. Nothing!

00:03:31.584 --> 00:03:33.152
He must be eliminated.

00:03:33.152 --> 00:03:34.387
[Frustrated groan]

00:03:34.387 --> 00:03:36.856
Now, please don't
get excited, Eggman.

00:03:36.856 --> 00:03:38.357
Just calm down.

00:03:38.357 --> 00:03:39.492
Calm down?

00:03:39.492 --> 00:03:42.261
How can I be calm with
this menace on the loose?

00:03:42.261 --> 00:03:44.764
I've worked hard to bring
light to your people!

00:03:44.764 --> 00:03:47.233
But all Sonic wants
to do is stop me.

00:03:47.867 --> 00:03:50.136
Yes, I believe you're right.

00:03:50.136 --> 00:03:51.737
He's a public threat.

00:03:51.737 --> 00:03:55.107
Instruct my commanders that I
want Sonic stopped immediately.

00:03:55.107 --> 00:03:56.108
Yes, sir!

00:04:12.992 --> 00:04:14.660
[Chuckle]

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.530
That gasbag sure is
gullible, isn't he?

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.831
He sure is.

00:04:18.831 --> 00:04:20.065
Right, Bocoe?

00:04:20.065 --> 00:04:22.034
Haha. Sonic is finished.

00:04:22.034 --> 00:04:23.669
[Chuckling]

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:24.303
Huh?

00:04:24.303 --> 00:04:30.075
Eggman! Eggman! Eggman!
Eggman! Eggman! Egg!

00:04:30.075 --> 00:04:32.611
Thank you all. You're very kind.

00:04:32.611 --> 00:04:34.246
[Sinister chuckling]

00:04:34.246 --> 00:04:35.915
Isn't it funny, Bocoe?

00:04:35.915 --> 00:04:38.083
Who would've thought
this could happen?

00:04:38.083 --> 00:04:40.352
Now Dr. Eggman is the hero,

00:04:40.352 --> 00:04:42.288
and Sonic is the bad guy.

00:04:42.288 --> 00:04:44.423
I'm so happy I could blow a fuse.

00:04:44.423 --> 00:04:46.158

What is it, Rouge?

00:04:55.601 --> 00:04:57.603
Is the noise from the chopper
blades getting to you?

00:04:57.603 --> 00:05:00.773
I'm okay. But I'm sensing
something weird.

00:05:03.876 --> 00:05:05.744
Follow her!

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:21.660
[Sigh]

00:05:22.261 --> 00:05:23.562
I miss the light.

00:05:29.034 --> 00:05:30.970
Poor little kid.

00:05:35.341 --> 00:05:36.308
Knuckles!

00:05:36.308 --> 00:05:38.077
We've got a really
big favor to ask ya.

00:05:39.044 --> 00:05:40.079
Favor?

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:42.448
If Sonic keeps knocking
down the mirror towers,

00:05:42.448 --> 00:05:44.083
we'll never get out of the dark.

00:05:44.083 --> 00:05:46.018
He'll listen to you.

00:05:46.018 --> 00:05:47.086
Help us.

Okay! [Grunt]

00:06:32.965 --> 00:06:36.335
Only you can stop Sonic from
knocking down the towers.

00:06:36.335 --> 00:06:37.570
Please, Knuckles.

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.838
We don't know who else to turn to.

00:06:39.838 --> 00:06:40.973
We're begging you.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.810
[Crowd chatter] We're
counting on you, Knuckles.

00:06:45.778 --> 00:06:47.947
All right. I'll give it a try.

00:06:47.947 --> 00:06:49.882
You'll really talk to him?

00:06:49.882 --> 00:06:51.250
Thanks, Knuckles!

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.785
He's gonna do it!

00:06:52.785 --> 00:06:54.420
You're the best, Knuckles!

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:02.161
You've gone too far, Sonic.

00:07:02.161 --> 00:07:03.462
And I've got to stop you.

00:07:08.334 --> 00:07:09.702
Hey, Chris?

00:07:11.904 --> 00:07:13.939
Is something bothering you?

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.874
No.

00:07:15.874 --> 00:07:17.109
I'm fine.

00:07:17.109 --> 00:07:19.311
You haven't been yourself lately.

00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:20.412
Me?

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.348
[Sigh]

00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:26.352
Well, one part of me thinks Sonic

00:07:26.352 --> 00:07:28.954
could never do the things
they say he's doing.

00:07:28.954 --> 00:07:29.922
But...

00:07:29.922 --> 00:07:33.859
Well, I just don't know
what to believe anymore.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.863
We know you think he
knocked those towers over!

00:07:37.863 --> 00:07:40.265
But he'd never do that!

00:07:40.265 --> 00:07:42.601
I wish I could have
total faith in Sonic.

00:07:42.601 --> 00:07:44.937
But I just can't understand
what he's doing.

00:07:44.937 --> 00:07:47.840
If you want to know how
to have faith, ask Amy.

00:07:49.775 --> 00:07:50.909
It's easy!

00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:52.845
Eh, maybe for you.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:55.981
Listen.

00:07:55.981 --> 00:07:57.349
There's been lots of times

00:07:57.349 --> 00:07:59.852
when Sonic did something
or didn't do something

00:07:59.852 --> 00:08:02.187
that made me wonder
why I ever liked him.

00:08:02.187 --> 00:08:03.455
But in the end,

00:08:03.455 --> 00:08:05.424
he always comes through for me.

00:08:05.424 --> 00:08:07.059
He may do crazy things,

00:08:07.059 --> 00:08:08.961
and he may do stupid things,

00:08:08.961 --> 00:08:11.196
but he never does dishonest things.

00:08:11.196 --> 00:08:12.197
That's why...

00:08:12.197 --> 00:08:14.166
I'll always have faith in him!

00:08:14.166 --> 00:08:15.534
Amy's right.

00:08:15.534 --> 00:08:17.536
I always trust Sonic.

00:08:17.536 --> 00:08:18.804
It <i>is</i> easy!

00:08:18.804 --> 00:08:20.973
I <i>do</i> have faith in him!

00:08:20.973 --> 00:08:22.908
Thanks a lot, Amy!

00:08:22.908 --> 00:08:24.677
Sure! Anytime, Chris!

00:08:24.677 --> 00:08:26.178
Come on, Tails.

00:08:26.178 --> 00:08:28.547
We'd better go and look for Sonic.

00:08:30.482 --> 00:08:32.051
Am I good or what?

00:08:35.354 --> 00:08:36.955

to see you, old buddy.

If I didn't know better,

00:09:17.062 --> 00:09:19.264
I'd say you're trying
to pick a fight.

00:09:19.264 --> 00:09:20.466
Right!

I'm gonna teach you
a lesson, Sonic!

00:09:41.787 --> 00:09:42.755
[Grunt]

00:09:43.088 --> 00:09:45.023
Aah!

00:09:49.868 --> 00:09:54.273
[Panting]

00:09:54.273 --> 00:09:57.242
[Yelling]

00:09:57.242 --> 00:09:58.710
[Yelling] Oof!

00:10:00.779 --> 00:10:01.847
No luck!

00:10:01.847 --> 00:10:04.650
It doesn't look like
there's any way in, Rouge.

00:10:05.117 --> 00:10:06.551
That's too bad.

00:10:06.551 --> 00:10:08.754
Because this looks like
the power station.

00:10:12.291 --> 00:10:14.226
[Sounds of fighting]

00:10:15.294 --> 00:10:17.329
Ah! Look down there!

00:10:17.329 --> 00:10:19.698
Sonic and Knuckles are fighting!

00:10:19.698 --> 00:10:20.866
That's news.

00:10:20.866 --> 00:10:22.634
[Grunt]

00:10:22.634 --> 00:10:23.902
Oof!

00:10:23.902 --> 00:10:24.803
Ugh...

00:10:24.803 --> 00:10:25.804
Oof.

00:10:25.804 --> 00:10:27.272
[Panting]

00:10:28.206 --> 00:10:30.242
Want to call it quits?

00:10:30.242 --> 00:10:33.278
Not until I make you pay
for the damage you've done.

00:10:33.879 --> 00:10:35.580
[Sounds of fighting]

00:10:37.282 --> 00:10:38.250
Woah!

00:10:39.217 --> 00:10:42.087
All right, you guys.
Cut it out right now!

00:10:42.988 --> 00:10:44.489
Don't interfere!

00:10:44.489 --> 00:10:45.991
Sonic!

00:10:45.991 --> 00:10:48.593
Hey, I'll all for
keepin' the peace, pal.

00:10:48.593 --> 00:10:50.395
It's Knuckles who started it.

00:10:50.395 --> 00:10:52.164
You bet I started it!

00:10:52.164 --> 00:10:54.099
Do you ever stop to
think about the trouble

00:10:54.099 --> 00:10:55.867
you're causing innocent people?

00:10:55.867 --> 00:10:56.735
Do you?!

00:10:56.735 --> 00:10:57.703
Huh?

00:10:57.703 --> 00:10:58.937
What trouble?

00:10:58.937 --> 00:11:00.706
Okay, that's it!

00:11:00.706 --> 00:11:01.673
Grr...

00:11:02.774 --> 00:11:04.276
Sonic the Hedgehog!

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:05.777
Huh?

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.148
What's going on?

00:11:13.051 --> 00:11:14.653
Stay where you are, Sonic.

00:11:14.653 --> 00:11:16.321
We've got you surrounded.

00:11:16.321 --> 00:11:19.758
Just turn yourself in quietly
and there won't be any trouble.

00:11:24.296 --> 00:11:25.130
Look out!

00:11:25.864 --> 00:11:27.632
I'll take care of 'em!

00:11:27.632 --> 00:11:28.867
Knuckles, no!

00:11:28.867 --> 00:11:31.803
Hey, hey, chill out, everybody.

00:11:31.803 --> 00:11:33.105
Let's all stay calm.

00:11:33.105 --> 00:11:35.107
You stay calm!

00:11:35.107 --> 00:11:37.075
Knuckles!

00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:38.877
Wake up, kid!

00:11:38.877 --> 00:11:40.679
Don't you know it's Sonic
who's been knocking down

00:11:40.679 --> 00:11:43.115
all these towers everywhere?

00:11:43.115 --> 00:11:45.050
Yes, I know.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.385
It's just...

00:11:46.385 --> 00:11:47.919
Well, I have faith in Sonic!

00:11:47.919 --> 00:11:51.123
And if he's doing it, there
must be a good reason!

00:11:51.123 --> 00:11:52.090
Oh, yeah?

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:54.026
Well, what good reason
could there be?

00:11:54.026 --> 00:11:56.395
You tell me! I'd like
to hear just one!

00:11:56.395 --> 00:11:57.896
I'll give you one, Knuckles.

00:11:58.263 --> 00:11:59.498
Up there.

00:12:01.633 --> 00:12:02.634
Hm?

00:12:02.634 --> 00:12:03.602
Huh?

00:12:06.938 --> 00:12:09.908
There's somethin' about that Egg
Moon that's been bothering me.

00:12:09.908 --> 00:12:12.444
There's lots about
you that bothers me!

00:12:12.444 --> 00:12:14.913
If you give me a
chance, I can explain.

00:12:14.913 --> 00:12:16.848
Well, what is there to explain?

00:12:16.848 --> 00:12:19.451
The Egg Moon won't move
until it gets fixed.

00:12:19.451 --> 00:12:20.685
We know that!

00:12:20.685 --> 00:12:22.320
Maybe you do.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.389
But I know differently.

00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:25.891
What?

00:12:25.891 --> 00:12:28.794
Lemme give you a little
astronomy lesson.

00:12:28.794 --> 00:12:31.029
If the Egg Moon was
really standing still,

00:12:31.029 --> 00:12:33.398
it couldn't block the
sun all the time.

00:12:33.398 --> 00:12:35.400
Hey, that's right!

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:39.671
It only looks like the Egg Moon's
standing still 'cause we're moving, too!

00:12:39.671 --> 00:12:42.307
And there's one more
thing you can't forget.

00:12:42.307 --> 00:12:45.677
This planet and the moon are
both revolving around the sun!

00:12:45.677 --> 00:12:46.645
Huh.

00:12:47.612 --> 00:12:48.580
Huh?

00:12:49.548 --> 00:12:50.515
Augh!

00:12:50.515 --> 00:12:51.950
I'm confused!

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:54.886
Chris, in order for the
Egg Moon to block the sun,

00:12:54.886 --> 00:12:56.655
it's gotta be moving, too!

00:12:56.655 --> 00:12:58.190
Eggman's been controlling it

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:01.493
so he can con everyone into buying
those silly Sunshine Balls

00:13:01.493 --> 00:13:02.661
he invented.

00:13:02.661 --> 00:13:05.163
It's just a cheap,
get-rich-quick scheme.

00:13:05.163 --> 00:13:06.865
That lousy...!

00:13:06.865 --> 00:13:09.167
And everybody thinks
he's the big hero!

00:13:09.167 --> 00:13:12.104
[Evil chuckle]

00:13:12.104 --> 00:13:18.310
[Crowds clamoring]

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.979
Just listen to those
cheers, Doctor.

00:13:20.979 --> 00:13:23.148
Doesn't it make you feel good?

00:13:23.148 --> 00:13:24.116
[Crying]

00:13:24.116 --> 00:13:25.650
Marvelous!

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:27.552
It's all going just as I planned.

00:13:28.253 --> 00:13:29.488
Oh?

00:13:31.256 --> 00:13:33.458
What do you mean by that, Doctor?

00:13:33.992 --> 00:13:37.996
Don't tell me you metallic meatheads
think this hero act is for real.

00:13:37.996 --> 00:13:41.566
Why, I planned this crafty little
coup right from the beginning!

00:13:41.566 --> 00:13:43.502
You did?

00:13:43.502 --> 00:13:45.003
Certainly, I did!

00:13:45.003 --> 00:13:47.606
Look closely at those
yahoos down there.

00:13:47.606 --> 00:13:49.541
They look like they're in a trance.
CROWD: Egg-man.

00:13:49.541 --> 00:14:00.585
Egg-man.

00:14:02.287 --> 00:14:03.588
Here's my secret.

00:14:03.588 --> 00:14:07.459
Every Sunshine Ball emits
a hidden subliminal message

00:14:07.459 --> 00:14:12.297
that compels everyone who has
one to hail me as their hero.

00:14:13.064 --> 00:14:16.501
You mean all those people
down there are hypnotized?

00:14:17.202 --> 00:14:18.603
To think you are good?

00:14:18.603 --> 00:14:20.605
And that's not all.

00:14:20.605 --> 00:14:22.574
The Egg Moon is in place,

00:14:22.574 --> 00:14:24.509
and ready for Stage Two.

00:14:26.044 --> 00:14:27.579
[Evil chuckle]

00:14:27.579 --> 00:14:30.482
The Eggman Empire is nearly here!

00:14:30.482 --> 00:14:31.650
[Evil cackle]

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:32.617
Oh.

00:14:32.617 --> 00:14:34.519
We are not the good guys after all.

00:14:34.519 --> 00:14:37.422
Oh, well. It was fun
while it lasted.

00:14:37.422 --> 00:14:38.390
Aww.

00:14:40.926 --> 00:14:43.128
So Eggman's no hero.

00:14:43.128 --> 00:14:46.631
Why didn't you explain this before
you knocked down the towers?!

00:14:46.631 --> 00:14:48.567
I thought it was obvious.

00:14:48.567 --> 00:14:50.635
I can't help it if you're slow.

00:14:50.635 --> 00:14:51.903
Watch it!

00:14:55.874 --> 00:14:57.342
Now what?

00:14:57.809 --> 00:14:59.511
This is Topaz.

00:14:59.511 --> 00:15:01.913
I need to speak to the
president immediately.

00:15:04.416 --> 00:15:05.784
[Grumble]

00:15:07.118 --> 00:15:08.386
Mr. President.

00:15:08.386 --> 00:15:09.688
What is it, sir?

00:15:10.689 --> 00:15:12.257
Dr. Eggman.

00:15:12.257 --> 00:15:14.192
He's tricked us again.

00:15:14.192 --> 00:15:16.127
[Sinister chuckle]

00:15:16.127 --> 00:15:17.762
You found me out, eh, Prez?

00:15:18.129 --> 00:15:20.899
You've made a fool out of me
for the last time, you hear?

00:15:20.899 --> 00:15:23.001
Ha! From the sound of the crowd,

00:15:23.001 --> 00:15:26.504
I'm the hero, and you're
the fool, Mr. President.

00:15:26.938 --> 00:15:28.640
This is terrible.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.643
Just listen to those numbskulls.

00:15:31.643 --> 00:15:34.312
They're calling for me
to be their new leader!

00:15:34.312 --> 00:15:36.314
But... what about me?

00:15:37.616 --> 00:15:40.185
You, Mr. President, are my hostage!

00:15:47.235 --> 00:15:49.003
So now what do we do?

00:15:49.003 --> 00:15:49.937
Well, I say,

00:15:49.937 --> 00:15:53.674
if we can't destroy the Egg
Moon controller from down here,

00:15:53.674 --> 00:15:56.577
then we'll just have to get
rid of it from up there.

00:15:58.846 --> 00:16:00.615
Well, whaddaya say, Knuckster?

00:16:00.615 --> 00:16:02.450
The name's Knuckles, wiseguy.

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:05.152
Hey! Easy, boy.

00:16:05.152 --> 00:16:07.455
If I may, I would like to pilot.

00:16:11.792 --> 00:16:12.994
Works for me!

00:16:12.994 --> 00:16:13.961
[Sigh]

00:16:13.961 --> 00:16:17.431
[Crowd cheering]

00:16:17.965 --> 00:16:19.367
It's no good, sir.

00:16:19.367 --> 00:16:20.334
We can't get through.

00:16:20.334 --> 00:16:22.436
There are just too
many people out here.

00:16:30.311 --> 00:16:31.746
Homeroom, I'm inside.

00:16:31.746 --> 00:16:33.347
And starting the search.

00:16:35.416 --> 00:16:37.852
[Mumbling]

00:16:41.956 --> 00:16:42.924
Perfect.

00:16:44.158 --> 00:16:46.460
It's the new Eggman dollar bill.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.528
That is nice, Doctor,

00:16:47.528 --> 00:16:50.565
but I've made a Bocoe
100-dollar bill.

00:16:50.565 --> 00:16:53.701
I have got a Decoe
1,000-dollar bill.

00:16:54.068 --> 00:16:56.971
Keep your two ugly
mugs off my money!

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.042
Woah!

00:17:05.379 --> 00:17:06.781
Let's go, Eggman.

00:17:06.781 --> 00:17:08.749
Your little political party's over!

00:17:08.749 --> 00:17:09.717
Hmph!

00:17:10.451 --> 00:17:11.419
[Groan]

00:17:11.419 --> 00:17:13.087
Sonic...

00:17:13.087 --> 00:17:14.322
Stop there!

00:17:14.322 --> 00:17:15.556
Yeah, right!

00:17:15.556 --> 00:17:16.557
Ha!

00:17:16.557 --> 00:17:18.259
I warned you,

00:17:18.259 --> 00:17:20.394
one step closer and he's finished.

00:17:20.394 --> 00:17:22.563
Careful you don't
squeeze the air out.

00:17:22.563 --> 00:17:23.497
Huh?

00:17:23.497 --> 00:17:25.032
Oh, no!

00:17:27.501 --> 00:17:29.036
Mission accomplished.

00:17:29.036 --> 00:17:30.972
Nice work!

00:17:30.972 --> 00:17:32.006
Keep away!

00:17:33.541 --> 00:17:36.911
[Yelling]

00:17:46.654 --> 00:17:48.990
You're amazingly good
at this, Mr. Tanaka.

00:17:49.957 --> 00:17:51.025
As a butler,

00:17:51.025 --> 00:17:54.095
one must have the skill to do more
than simply answer doorbells.

00:17:56.497 --> 00:17:58.599
Okay, Knuckles. Hit it!

00:17:59.567 --> 00:18:01.035
Here goes!

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:03.537
[Grunt]

00:18:21.155 --> 00:18:22.123
Woah!

00:18:24.425 --> 00:18:25.793
Ah!

00:18:25.793 --> 00:18:27.161
It's back, honey.

00:18:28.229 --> 00:18:29.196
Yes.

00:18:29.864 --> 00:18:31.098
And it's still beautiful.

00:18:31.098 --> 00:18:32.600
[Happy sigh]

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:40.174
[Everyone cheering]

00:18:48.716 --> 00:18:51.118
We should watch the sunrise
from here sometime.

00:18:51.118 --> 00:18:52.453
We should!

00:18:52.453 --> 00:18:53.421
Hmph.

00:18:55.056 --> 00:18:56.457
That's that!

00:18:57.425 --> 00:18:59.360
Hey, what's the matter, Rouge?

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.861
I thought you'd be pleased.

00:19:00.861 --> 00:19:04.165
Eh. I liked this place better
when it was in the dark.

00:19:04.932 --> 00:19:07.935
[Panting]

00:19:07.935 --> 00:19:11.005
I liked it better
when we were heroes!

00:19:11.005 --> 00:19:13.541
Quiet. Just keep running!

00:19:13.541 --> 00:19:15.076
They're after us!

00:19:15.076 --> 00:19:17.344
[Continued panting]

00:19:17.812 --> 00:19:20.414
Woah!

00:19:20.414 --> 00:19:23.350
Question one: I first
met Sonic the Hedgehog

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.619
when he fell into my living room.

00:19:25.619 --> 00:19:26.554
Yes or no?

00:19:26.554 --> 00:19:27.521
No!

00:19:27.521 --> 00:19:28.556
Ugh!

00:19:28.556 --> 00:19:31.025
[Panting]

00:19:31.025 --> 00:19:32.426
Next one.

00:19:32.426 --> 00:19:35.463
The X Tornado can fly more
than 300 miles an hour,

00:19:35.463 --> 00:19:38.933
and can withstand attacks by
changing into battle armor mode?

00:19:38.933 --> 00:19:39.900
Yes!

00:19:42.336 --> 00:19:43.604
Yes or no?

00:19:43.604 --> 00:19:46.540
Sonic says I'm the prettiest
girl in the whole world!

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.709
No way, Jose!

00:19:48.709 --> 00:19:50.544
Well, you don't have to rub it in.

00:19:53.814 --> 00:19:55.616
Just one more to go.

00:19:55.616 --> 00:19:57.218
Think carefully, doctor.

00:19:57.218 --> 00:19:58.953
If you answer this one correctly,

00:19:58.953 --> 00:20:00.488
you will be the big winner!

00:20:00.488 --> 00:20:03.124
Don't worry. With my
eggceptionally high IQ,

00:20:03.124 --> 00:20:04.959
I'm bound to get it right.

00:20:05.459 --> 00:20:07.862
Who's the coolest guy around?

00:20:07.862 --> 00:20:09.196
Me, or you?

00:20:09.196 --> 00:20:10.998
What a ridiculous question!

00:20:10.998 --> 00:20:12.166
It's me, of course!

00:20:14.168 --> 00:20:17.037
Waugh!

00:20:17.037 --> 00:20:20.040
[Commotion]

00:20:22.343 --> 00:20:24.845
Grr...! I'll be back!

00:20:25.846 --> 00:20:28.749
And to think this morning
we were flying high.

00:20:28.749 --> 00:20:31.385
Now look at us. Jail birds.

00:20:31.385 --> 00:20:34.555
You fools! Let me out of here!

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:39.393
From a big hero to a big zero.

00:20:39.393 --> 00:20:41.128
Sonic! Sonic!

00:20:41.128 --> 00:20:42.062
Uh-oh!

00:20:42.062 --> 00:20:46.133
Sonic! Sonic!

00:20:46.133 --> 00:20:47.401
[Giggling]

00:20:47.401 --> 00:20:49.603
Looks like Sonic's the real hero!

00:20:49.603 --> 00:20:53.207
But then we knew that
all along, didn't we?
