WEBVTT

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.244
My new program will let us detect

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:13.346
a Chaos Emerald anywhere
in the galaxy,

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:16.316
no matter how far away it may be.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:19.452
All right, Sonic.

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:20.720
Whaddaya say we try it out?

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.721
Sure thing!

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:22.822
Okay.

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:30.063
Now we just connect it
to the main interface,

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:31.932
and we'll be on our way!

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:37.771
Knuckles, everything okay?

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:40.674
So far, so good.

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:43.476
Wow!

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:45.011
What's up? You got something?

00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:47.514
Yeah, I'm detecting
a response already.

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:51.251
[Beeping]

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:53.119
It's thanks to you, Chris!

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:54.921
It's no big deal, really.

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:56.523
Sure it's a big deal!

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:58.124
I've built lots of neat stuff,

00:00:58.124 --> 00:01:00.727
but I couldn't have come up with
something this good overnight.

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:03.163
[Chuckling sheepishly] Aw, come
on, Tails, you're embarrassing me.

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:05.065
Amy, what's the location?

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:09.035
The signal's coming from a
place called Planet Breezy.

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:10.403
That sounds cool.

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:13.039
Okay, Planet Breezy, here we come!

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:14.975
We're on our way!

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:20.046
Engage warp field driver!

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:30.523
Warp field ready.

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:32.559
Let's go!

00:01:49.743 --> 00:01:51.344
Go, go, go, go, go

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:54.447
Gotta go fast

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:57.384
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:59.653 --> 00:02:03.189
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.258
Got ourselves a situation

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:07.293
Stuck in a new location

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:10.897
Without any explanation

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:12.966
No talk of relaxation

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.601
Don't, don't, don't

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:16.403
Don't blink, don't think

00:02:16.403 --> 00:02:18.204
Just go, go, go, go

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:19.706
Go, go

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:25.245
Sonic is on the run

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:27.147
Sonic, he's number one

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:30.850
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.554
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:36.956
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:38.858
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:02:38.858 --> 00:02:41.361
Sonic X

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:43.296
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.132
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:47.100
Sonic X

00:03:04.497 --> 00:03:07.400
[Electricity crackles]

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:11.837
[Sinister laughter]

00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:21.147
[Evil laughter]

00:03:21.147 --> 00:03:22.348
I'm a genius!

00:03:22.348 --> 00:03:25.418
Sonic and those time-warping
nitwits can't shake me!

00:03:25.418 --> 00:03:28.487
Not with my spanking-new,
all-space tracking system.

00:03:28.487 --> 00:03:31.057
No matter what they
do, or where they go,

00:03:31.057 --> 00:03:32.925
I'll be right behind them!

00:03:32.925 --> 00:03:34.860
Throw it into Eggdrive!

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.662
Aye-aye, Doctor.

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:38.064
Hm?

00:03:52.745 --> 00:03:58.184
[Beeping]

00:03:58.184 --> 00:04:00.853
There it is, guys. Straight ahead.

00:04:00.853 --> 00:04:02.588
But it looks like rough weather.

00:04:02.588 --> 00:04:05.458
The whole planet's in the middle
of a terrible snowstorm.

00:04:05.458 --> 00:04:09.228
[Gasp] Maybe the Metarex have
taken its Planet Egg away.

00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:12.965
That would explain the weird
weather they're having.

00:04:18.004 --> 00:04:20.406
Everything looks
so cold and lonely.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.976
Even so, we have to go down
there and look for the Emerald.

00:04:23.976 --> 00:04:25.511
Ready, Sonic?

00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:27.747
Sure! Let's go!

00:04:39.025 --> 00:04:39.825
ALL: Ah!

00:04:39.825 --> 00:04:41.027
Chao chao chao!

00:04:45.197 --> 00:04:47.166
[All gasp]

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.669
What is that thing, Chris?

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:51.237
It's a Metarex.

00:04:52.204 --> 00:04:53.939
[High-pitched roaring]

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:55.474
[All scream]

00:05:08.287 --> 00:05:10.222
[All scream]

00:05:10.222 --> 00:05:14.293
[Alarms sound]

00:05:14.293 --> 00:05:15.261
Hang on, guys!

00:05:15.261 --> 00:05:17.763
I'm gonna have to bring
it in for a landing!

00:05:35.648 --> 00:05:38.150
Knuckles, do we have any damage?

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.685
I'm afraid so.

00:05:39.685 --> 00:05:42.888
Looks like Engines 1
and 3 have been hit.

00:05:43.856 --> 00:05:46.125
We'll have to fix 'em, or we'll
never get off the ground.

00:05:47.093 --> 00:05:48.360
Oh, great.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.264
My tracking system indicates
Sonic's somewhere on this planet.

00:05:53.365 --> 00:05:55.334
Which means those nasty creatures

00:05:55.334 --> 00:05:58.204
will be coming soon to
try and destroy him.

00:05:58.871 --> 00:06:00.072
The Metarex?

00:06:00.072 --> 00:06:02.742
And it's very likely we'll
come under attack, too,

00:06:02.742 --> 00:06:05.644
unless we play a subtle
game of subterfuge.

00:06:05.644 --> 00:06:09.415
We're gonna play a game!
We're gonna play a game!

00:06:09.415 --> 00:06:11.317
Go on, get busy!

00:06:11.317 --> 00:06:12.885
[Grunting]

00:06:13.586 --> 00:06:15.888
What game do you play with these?

00:06:15.888 --> 00:06:17.289
There's no game!

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:19.391
Go out and make sure
the ship won't be seen!

00:06:19.391 --> 00:06:20.726
ROBOTS: Huh? Huh.
EGGMAN: Now get moving!

00:06:20.726 --> 00:06:23.129
I want this thing in
an igloo by nightfall!

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:24.330
Hmm.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.898
Yes, Doctor.

00:06:27.266 --> 00:06:28.768
[Sigh]

00:06:28.768 --> 00:06:31.270
Well, at least Rouge isn't here.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.238
Really?

00:06:32.238 --> 00:06:33.606
BOKUN: Oh?
ROUGE: [Laughter]

00:06:33.606 --> 00:06:36.008
This isn't my day.

00:06:36.008 --> 00:06:39.645
If I didn't know better, I might
think you're not happy to see me.

00:06:39.645 --> 00:06:41.680
Oh, no, Rouge! Don't think that!

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.982
Oh, I'm glad,

00:06:42.982 --> 00:06:46.852
because I've got another tiny little
favor I need you to do for me.

00:06:46.852 --> 00:06:47.853
Huh?

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.223
You will help me, won't you?

00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:53.159
Aw...

00:06:58.964 --> 00:07:01.400
Aargh!

00:07:03.936 --> 00:07:06.305
Let's get this snow on the road!

00:07:06.305 --> 00:07:07.807
[Chuckling]

00:07:07.807 --> 00:07:09.375
[Grunt] It might be...

00:07:09.375 --> 00:07:10.442
SONIC: Oof.
CHRIS: ...deep.

00:07:10.442 --> 00:07:11.911
[Muffled sounds]

00:07:11.911 --> 00:07:15.548
Don't worry. I packed
some new snowshoes.

00:07:15.881 --> 00:07:17.817
[Muffled struggling]

00:07:17.817 --> 00:07:19.752
Got any earmuffs?

00:07:26.358 --> 00:07:27.827
What are you doing?

00:07:27.827 --> 00:07:29.595
I'm trying to listen.

00:07:29.995 --> 00:07:31.630
Trying to listen to what?

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.267
If this tree is still alive,
I will hear it's life force.

00:07:37.236 --> 00:07:38.938
I knew we were too late.

00:07:38.938 --> 00:07:40.406
Don't worry, Cosmo.

00:07:40.406 --> 00:07:42.675
Maybe it'll come to
life again next spring.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.679
There won't be a spring.

00:07:46.679 --> 00:07:47.646
Hm.

00:07:53.552 --> 00:07:56.889
If the Metarex had already
taken the Planet Egg away,

00:07:56.889 --> 00:08:00.025
there'd be no reason for them
to still be hanging around.

00:08:00.025 --> 00:08:03.095
Maybe it's because the
Egg's still here someplace!

00:08:03.095 --> 00:08:05.564
If that's true, we have
to try and find it.

00:08:05.564 --> 00:08:06.565
We don't have time.

00:08:06.565 --> 00:08:09.768
If we find it, this planet
might have a chance to survive.

00:08:09.768 --> 00:08:12.004
I know we came here
for a Chaos Emerald,

00:08:12.004 --> 00:08:13.906
but couldn't we look
for a Planet Egg, too?

00:08:13.906 --> 00:08:15.374
No way.

00:08:15.374 --> 00:08:16.976
What do you think, Sonic?

00:08:16.976 --> 00:08:19.545
The Blue Typhoon's damaged.

00:08:20.512 --> 00:08:22.448
Maybe we could use the X Tornado.

00:08:22.448 --> 00:08:24.917
If we look for the Egg,
we might find the Emerald.

00:08:24.917 --> 00:08:26.619
Then I say we do it!

00:08:26.619 --> 00:08:28.053
[Chuckling]

00:08:28.053 --> 00:08:29.355
Thank you both.

00:08:29.355 --> 00:08:31.557
This planet will be
so grateful to you.

00:08:31.557 --> 00:08:33.192
Oh, all right, let's go!

00:09:08.594 --> 00:09:10.195
[Beeping]

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.205
Our enemies have arrived.

00:09:20.205 --> 00:09:27.613
[Metarex growl in reply]

00:09:33.018 --> 00:09:37.932
[All snoring]

00:09:37.932 --> 00:09:39.868
Rouge really did it this time!

00:09:39.868 --> 00:09:42.604
Hot chocolate with sleeping powder!

00:09:46.107 --> 00:09:48.443
I knocked those three out for good.

00:09:48.443 --> 00:09:51.446
While they're sleeping, I'll be on
the lookout for the Chaos Emerald.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.952
Oh! Unless I go snow blind!

00:09:59.954 --> 00:10:01.890
There they are.

00:10:02.857 --> 00:10:04.526
We're ready for 'em!

00:10:04.926 --> 00:10:07.428
[Roaring]

00:10:07.428 --> 00:10:08.429
Let's go!

00:10:10.165 --> 00:10:12.133
[Grunt] Got it!

00:10:12.133 --> 00:10:13.902
[Roaring]

00:10:15.837 --> 00:10:21.643
[Sounds of fighting]

00:10:24.546 --> 00:10:26.147
[Metarex grunt in pain]

00:10:31.186 --> 00:10:33.121
Don't let 'em get away, Chris!

00:10:33.121 --> 00:10:34.189
I won't!

00:10:34.189 --> 00:10:36.191
[Roaring]

00:10:44.365 --> 00:10:45.533
[Gasp]

00:10:47.835 --> 00:10:52.407
[Loud rumbling]

00:10:52.407 --> 00:10:54.142
I think we're in big trouble.

00:10:54.142 --> 00:10:57.745
[Loud rumbling]

00:11:06.487 --> 00:11:07.655
Oh, no!

00:11:16.397 --> 00:11:17.498
[Crash]

00:11:28.142 --> 00:11:30.144
Back to the repair shop...

00:11:30.144 --> 00:11:31.646
Hey, look!

00:11:36.551 --> 00:11:37.518
Wow.

00:11:37.518 --> 00:11:39.320
It's unbelievable!

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.655
Chao chao!

00:11:45.426 --> 00:11:47.795
Wh-wh-whoa!

00:11:47.795 --> 00:11:49.731
Ooof!

00:11:52.634 --> 00:11:54.736
Sonic! Use this!

00:11:56.437 --> 00:11:57.272
[Grunt]

00:12:00.608 --> 00:12:01.442
[Grunt]

00:12:01.442 --> 00:12:02.677
Oof!

00:12:02.677 --> 00:12:05.179
Wouldn't happen to have one of
those things for me, would ya?

00:12:05.179 --> 00:12:07.548
CHRIS: Sorry, Knuckles, I
only had time to make one!

00:12:07.548 --> 00:12:08.516
Yeah? Well, that's-

00:12:08.516 --> 00:12:09.484
Oof!

00:12:11.686 --> 00:12:15.056
I don't get any respect.
No respect at all!

00:12:17.959 --> 00:12:19.761
[Grunting]

00:12:21.763 --> 00:12:22.730
[Grunting]

00:12:23.264 --> 00:12:26.167
According to the scanner, the
Chaos Emerald's in the center of

00:12:26.167 --> 00:12:28.236
that ice palace.

00:12:29.203 --> 00:12:31.606
Roger! But first things first!

00:12:31.606 --> 00:12:33.207
Hang on, Knuckles!

00:12:42.917 --> 00:12:43.885
Haha!

00:12:44.485 --> 00:12:46.354
[Roaring]

00:12:49.057 --> 00:12:50.058
Oof!

00:12:56.197 --> 00:13:02.036
[Grunting]

00:13:03.771 --> 00:13:07.075
How will we ever defeat them all
when there's so many of them?

00:13:07.075 --> 00:13:08.276
Good question.

00:13:10.244 --> 00:13:11.813
My, my, my.

00:13:11.813 --> 00:13:16.651
All that sparkling ice makes this
place look like a 24-karat castle.

00:13:16.651 --> 00:13:17.285
Hm?

00:13:17.285 --> 00:13:18.319
[Roaring]

00:13:18.319 --> 00:13:19.320
Get lost!

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.555
[Grunting]

00:13:29.831 --> 00:13:31.332
Huh?

00:13:49.384 --> 00:13:50.351
Huh.

00:13:50.351 --> 00:13:51.319
[Grunt]

00:13:52.286 --> 00:13:53.821
[Grunting]

00:14:13.574 --> 00:14:15.843
Well, here it is.

00:14:17.445 --> 00:14:20.415
[Ice breaking]

00:14:21.182 --> 00:14:23.584
Sonic, can you get it out of there?

00:14:23.584 --> 00:14:25.019
I'll try.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.954
Mm-mm.

00:14:27.755 --> 00:14:29.457
Leave this to me!

00:14:30.425 --> 00:14:31.726
[Grunting]

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.161
Oof.

00:14:33.161 --> 00:14:34.962
That ice is harder than a diamond!

00:14:34.962 --> 00:14:36.097
Of course it is.

00:14:36.097 --> 00:14:39.801
If it were not, we would be at
the mercy of thieves like you.

00:14:39.801 --> 00:14:41.736
Come out where we can see you!

00:14:41.736 --> 00:14:42.837
Very well.

00:14:42.837 --> 00:14:45.606
Keep your eyes on the Emerald.

00:14:47.408 --> 00:14:48.943
Whoa!

00:14:52.547 --> 00:14:54.015
[Sinister laughter]

00:14:54.015 --> 00:14:55.716
You don't scare me!

00:14:55.716 --> 00:14:57.218
Aah! [Grunt]

00:14:57.919 --> 00:14:58.953
Hm!

00:15:00.588 --> 00:15:01.689
Oof.

00:15:02.223 --> 00:15:04.592
Now I will destroy you.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.202
Huh.

00:15:14.202 --> 00:15:15.536
Whoa!

00:15:16.137 --> 00:15:18.673
It's getting power
from the Emerald.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.576
[Sinister laughter]

00:15:30.818 --> 00:15:31.786
Run!

00:15:31.786 --> 00:15:33.554
Oh!

00:15:33.554 --> 00:15:34.121
[Panting]

00:15:34.121 --> 00:15:35.189
Rats!

00:15:38.226 --> 00:15:40.895
[Panting]

00:15:40.895 --> 00:15:43.531
[Growling]

00:15:43.531 --> 00:15:44.365
Ha!

00:15:47.869 --> 00:15:48.970
[Grunt]

00:15:51.172 --> 00:15:54.208
Huh? Huh? Aah!

00:15:59.204 --> 00:16:00.172
Oh!

00:16:00.172 --> 00:16:00.940
Oh.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.174
Ah.

00:16:05.044 --> 00:16:07.046
Hang in there guys!

00:16:07.046 --> 00:16:08.647
Aah!

00:16:14.687 --> 00:16:16.922
Our cannon's frozen solid.

00:16:20.693 --> 00:16:23.796
[Grunting]

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:26.932
The rockets didn't faze him.

00:16:29.935 --> 00:16:31.503
Heads up, Sonic!

00:16:32.504 --> 00:16:33.505
[Grunting]

00:16:34.506 --> 00:16:36.008
Grrr...

00:16:39.979 --> 00:16:41.280
[Roar]

00:16:46.752 --> 00:16:47.553
[Grunt]

00:16:47.553 --> 00:16:49.955
We've got to do
something to save him.

00:16:49.955 --> 00:16:51.123
Ah?

00:16:51.624 --> 00:16:52.424
Huh?

00:16:52.424 --> 00:16:55.127
I'm sorry, Chris. I just
hit the laser beam.

00:16:58.864 --> 00:16:59.798
Huh!

00:17:03.035 --> 00:17:05.638
Great job, Cosmo! You're
a real life-saver!

00:17:05.638 --> 00:17:06.305
Huh!

00:17:06.305 --> 00:17:09.475
The laser beam sliced
right through the ice!

00:17:09.475 --> 00:17:11.677
CHRIS: Knuckles, we're
headed for the engine room.

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:16.048
We're almost ready, Chris.

00:17:16.048 --> 00:17:20.386
You see, all we have to do is get
Knuckles to power up the laser cannon,

00:17:20.386 --> 00:17:21.687
and we'll be good to go.

00:17:21.687 --> 00:17:23.455
Let's do it!

00:17:29.495 --> 00:17:32.731
The seven Chaos Emeralds
are the servers.

00:17:33.432 --> 00:17:36.001
Our hearts intensify their power.

00:17:37.469 --> 00:17:38.704
Hm!

00:17:39.238 --> 00:17:43.475
60, 70, 80, 90â

00:17:46.645 --> 00:17:48.914
Energy charging sequence complete.

00:17:49.515 --> 00:17:50.916
Fire!

00:17:52.451 --> 00:17:55.621
Your weapons are of
no use against me!

00:18:02.127 --> 00:18:14.206
[Roaring]

00:18:35.961 --> 00:18:36.929
[All sighing]

00:18:37.896 --> 00:18:38.864
Hm?

00:18:39.631 --> 00:18:41.366
I found it!

00:18:44.036 --> 00:18:46.338
Huh? Ah! Grr.

00:18:46.338 --> 00:18:48.307
Thanks for doing the dirty work!

00:18:48.307 --> 00:18:50.275
I owe you one, Knuckie!

00:18:50.275 --> 00:18:52.244
You bring that back here!

00:18:52.244 --> 00:18:52.978
Aah!

00:18:52.978 --> 00:18:55.247
She just stole the Chaos Emerald!

00:18:55.247 --> 00:18:57.950
Thanks very much for the update!

00:19:00.285 --> 00:19:03.889
Hey, Knuckles, take a look at this!

00:19:07.459 --> 00:19:09.695
The grass! It's growing!

00:19:11.897 --> 00:19:13.465
Spring came after all!

00:19:13.465 --> 00:19:15.768
And before you know it,
this place will be just as

00:19:15.768 --> 00:19:17.703
green and beautiful
as it was before.

00:19:17.703 --> 00:19:19.505
Sure! Happy, Cosmo?

00:19:19.505 --> 00:19:20.606
Yes!

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.513
How dare you let them get away!

00:19:27.513 --> 00:19:29.848
I ought to dismantle
you snoozing losers!

00:19:29.848 --> 00:19:33.085
Don't blame us, Doctor.
You were snoozing, too!

00:19:33.085 --> 00:19:35.988
We all fell asleep after Bokkun
brought us hot chocolate!

00:19:35.988 --> 00:19:36.989
That's interesting.

00:19:36.989 --> 00:19:41.226
Aah! I-it wasn't me who put
sleeping powder in your cocoa!

00:19:41.226 --> 00:19:42.761
What?

00:19:42.761 --> 00:19:45.364
I mean, marshmallows!

00:19:45.364 --> 00:19:47.466
I'm not a very good traitor.

00:19:47.466 --> 00:19:50.402
Huh. Huh?

00:19:52.104 --> 00:19:53.839
Mmm.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:01.847
That nasty snow-globe
was so windy and wintry,

00:20:01.847 --> 00:20:03.882
even my gloves got goose-pimples.

00:20:03.882 --> 00:20:05.784
Oh well! [Laughing]

00:20:06.685 --> 00:20:10.489
Now I've got this hot little
baby to keep me warm.

00:20:11.123 --> 00:20:13.392
Positively perfect!

00:20:13.392 --> 00:20:16.295
Just get a load of that shine!

00:20:16.495 --> 00:20:18.430
Wait a minute.

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:19.398
This is aâ

00:20:19.398 --> 00:20:20.499
Fake!

00:20:20.499 --> 00:20:23.402
After I took a real good
look at the response data,

00:20:23.402 --> 00:20:25.838
I noticed something I hadn't
seen the first time.

00:20:25.838 --> 00:20:28.407
The components of the Emerald
were off so slightly,

00:20:28.407 --> 00:20:30.309
even the scanners
didn't pick it up.

00:20:30.309 --> 00:20:32.277
I've reprogrammed them, Tails.

00:20:32.277 --> 00:20:34.546
Next time, they'll only
respond to real Emeralds.

00:20:34.546 --> 00:20:35.848
But what I can't figure out

00:20:35.848 --> 00:20:38.717
is what that Metarex was
doing with a fake Emerald.

00:20:38.717 --> 00:20:40.819
Maybe the fake Emerald was a decoy

00:20:40.819 --> 00:20:43.989
the Metarex used to
throw us off the track.

00:20:44.423 --> 00:20:47.359
Wait'll Rouge finds out
she filched a phony!

00:20:47.359 --> 00:20:48.227
[Chuckling]

00:20:48.227 --> 00:20:50.696
They think they can
fool me, do they?

00:20:50.696 --> 00:20:52.631
We'll see about that!

00:20:53.365 --> 00:20:54.233
[Crystal shatters]

00:20:54.233 --> 00:20:56.802
I'll make them pay for this!

00:20:56.802 --> 00:21:00.072
I promise, I'll make them pay!
