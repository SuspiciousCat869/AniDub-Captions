00:00:00.534 --> 00:00:01.902
Last time on Sonic X,

00:00:01.902 --> 00:00:04.505
Sonic was locked up on Prison
Island in a high-tech,

00:00:04.505 --> 00:00:06.006
totally escape-proof jail.

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:09.209
But luckily, his friends were able
to stage a robot-busting rescue!

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:12.613
Meanwhile, Dr. Eggman and his
gang staged their own jailbreak--

00:00:12.613 --> 00:00:13.547
A break in!

00:00:13.547 --> 00:00:17.484
Their goal? To steal Chaos Emeralds
and power up Eggman's ultimate weapon.

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:19.186
With the island on the verge of destruction,

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:21.989
Sonic challenged the mysterious
Shadow to a showdown.

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:24.091
Our heroes made an explosive escape,

00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:25.592
but what about those left behind?

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:27.928
Could anyone survive that blazing blast?

00:00:27.928 --> 00:00:29.763
Find out next on Sonic X!

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.765
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:34.835
Gotta go fast

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.771
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:43.610
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.646
Got ourselves a situation

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:47.714
Stuck in a new location

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:51.318
Without any explanation

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.387
No talk of relaxation

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.022
Don't, don't, don't

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:56.823
Don't blink, don't think

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:58.625
Just go, go, go, go

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.127
Go, go

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:05.666
Sonic is on the run

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.534
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:11.271
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:14.942
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:17.377
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:19.279
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:21.782
Sonic X

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:23.684
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.520
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.554
Sonic X

00:01:37.522 --> 00:01:39.658
REPORTER: After the explosion
on Prison Island,

00:01:39.658 --> 00:01:42.527
an emergency response team
searched for survivors.

00:01:42.527 --> 00:01:46.732
Fortunately, the team now reports that
everyone made it off the island safely.

00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:48.000
[Sighs of relief]

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.435
I told ya not to worry!

00:01:50.435 --> 00:01:51.737
Chris must be okay!

00:01:51.737 --> 00:01:55.073
But if he's not on Prison
Island, and he's not here...

00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:56.141
[Gasp]

00:01:56.141 --> 00:01:58.477
Shadow must've taken him to Eggman!

00:01:58.477 --> 00:01:59.644
Hmm.

00:01:59.644 --> 00:02:00.812
Don't worry.

00:02:00.812 --> 00:02:03.448
I won't stop lookin' 'til
I bring Chris back home.

00:02:23.402 --> 00:02:24.803
REPORTER: In related news,

00:02:24.803 --> 00:02:27.906
authorities are still searching
for Sonic the Hedgehog who is-

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.179
I'm gonna go find my friend Chris.

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:35.747
But the police are looking for you!

00:02:35.747 --> 00:02:37.015
Don't worry!

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.353
I hope Sonic doesn't get caught again.

00:02:41.353 --> 00:02:43.855
If we all search, perhaps we can find Chris.

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:45.657
Where should we look?

00:02:45.657 --> 00:02:49.194
Shadow probably brought Chris
to Dr. Eggman's secret base.

00:02:49.194 --> 00:02:51.563
But we don't have any idea where it is.

00:02:51.563 --> 00:02:52.798
Tails has a good point.

00:02:52.798 --> 00:02:54.166
Well, if we're gonna find Chris,

00:02:54.166 --> 00:02:55.934
we'll have to find that base.

00:02:55.934 --> 00:02:58.203
Then let's start looking right away.

00:02:58.203 --> 00:02:59.371
Chao!

00:03:02.207 --> 00:03:04.743
I'm gonna get even with that bat!

00:03:06.378 --> 00:03:08.713
She stole the Master Emerald from me!

00:03:08.713 --> 00:03:10.248
Come back here!

00:03:10.248 --> 00:03:11.483
Oof!

00:03:12.017 --> 00:03:13.485
[Grunt]

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:15.487
You're... that girl!

00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:16.455
Oof!

00:03:16.455 --> 00:03:17.422
Ugh!

00:03:18.223 --> 00:03:20.759
Huh? Huh? Huh!

00:03:30.035 --> 00:03:31.002
[Gasp]

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:33.004
Sounded like a rocket.

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:41.480
[Gasp]

00:03:46.952 --> 00:03:49.020
Eggman's base.

00:03:58.396 --> 00:03:59.498
Woah.

00:04:00.732 --> 00:04:04.269
It's hard to believe that I
really traveled into space.

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.372
And we're inside a space station?

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:10.008
We call this place Space Colony ARK.

00:04:10.008 --> 00:04:11.743
I've never heard of it before.

00:04:11.743 --> 00:04:15.380
It was built 50 years ago by
Professor Gerald Robotnik.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.082
It's been kept secret.

00:04:17.082 --> 00:04:20.886
Wow! A secret space colony!

00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:23.688
I wonder if I'm the only kid
who's ever gone into space?

00:04:23.688 --> 00:04:24.923
You're not.

00:04:24.923 --> 00:04:25.824
What?

00:04:25.824 --> 00:04:27.626
Then who was?

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.362
Hey, you know what?

00:04:30.362 --> 00:04:32.664
You look a lot like my friend Sonic.

00:04:32.664 --> 00:04:35.167
Are the two of you... related?

00:04:35.167 --> 00:04:36.401
Huh.

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:38.336
Hm...

00:04:39.271 --> 00:04:41.206
Uh... Heh...

00:04:52.984 --> 00:04:53.952
Maria!

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.123
[Panting]

00:04:58.123 --> 00:05:00.492
Stop them! We can't let them get away!

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.069
Listen, Shadow. I want you to promise me...

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:12.270
Please...

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.338
No, wait!

00:05:13.338 --> 00:05:15.006
Whatever happens, remember,

00:05:15.006 --> 00:05:17.042
I'll always be your friend, Shadow.

00:05:17.042 --> 00:05:20.779
We always talked about going
to visit the planet one day.

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:23.181
But it looks like you'll
have to go there without me.

00:05:23.181 --> 00:05:26.084
Sayonara, Shadow the Hedgehog.

00:05:33.592 --> 00:05:35.227
They'll pay for what they did.

00:05:35.227 --> 00:05:36.494
Every one of them.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.602
Huh...

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:46.104
The Emeralds are set!

00:05:46.104 --> 00:05:48.873
All six are in place and
ready to power the cannon.

00:05:48.873 --> 00:05:51.843
Grrrr... Where's the blasted plug?

00:05:51.843 --> 00:05:52.944
Grr...

00:05:55.647 --> 00:05:57.983
This junk heap's the ultimate weapon?

00:05:57.983 --> 00:06:00.819
Maybe it makes everybody
laugh so hard they surrender.

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:03.455
The Eclipse Cannon draws its
energy from Chaos Emeralds,

00:06:03.455 --> 00:06:06.691
and generates enough firepower
to destroy an entire planet.

00:06:06.691 --> 00:06:08.059
Is that true?

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:09.828
It can really destroy a planet?

00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:11.496
You know he always exaggerates.

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:13.298
I can hear you!

00:06:13.298 --> 00:06:14.933
Never mind! [Nervous laughter]

00:06:17.802 --> 00:06:19.537
This antique works?

00:06:19.537 --> 00:06:21.539
Just you wait and see!

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:23.842
I'm going to be the ultimate big shot!

00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:25.010
[Laughs]

00:06:30.548 --> 00:06:31.583
What's up with Chris?

00:06:31.583 --> 00:06:34.219
I called to say hello, and
left a message for him.

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:35.754
But he never called me back!

00:06:35.754 --> 00:06:38.757
Nobody's heard anything from
Chris for a long time now.

00:06:38.757 --> 00:06:39.824
Hmm.

00:06:39.824 --> 00:06:41.092
Huh?

00:06:41.092 --> 00:06:42.027
Hey, was that-?

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:43.261
Yeah, it was [gulp]

00:06:43.261 --> 00:06:44.629
What are you doin'?

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:45.764
Ah, ah...

00:06:46.765 --> 00:06:47.732
Ah...

00:06:47.732 --> 00:06:49.534
[Sigh]

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:52.904
Oh, look at that!

00:06:52.904 --> 00:06:53.705
Huh?

00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:55.173
Isn't the sky pretty?

00:06:55.707 --> 00:06:58.710
Yeah, it's gonna be a beauty of a sunset.

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:06.384
[Gasp]

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:08.053
Oh! This is it.

00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:09.821
It might be difficult getting him to talk,

00:07:09.821 --> 00:07:13.692
considering the way his life fell apart
after he got mixed up in Project Shadow.

00:07:13.692 --> 00:07:15.260
If we push too hard for his story,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.228
he may not tell us anything.

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:18.997
French fries for lunch?

00:07:20.365 --> 00:07:21.499
[Knocking]

00:07:21.833 --> 00:07:23.268
I beg your pardon, sir.

00:07:23.268 --> 00:07:25.203
Does a Mr. Schmitz live here?

00:07:25.203 --> 00:07:26.805
You must mean the old guy.

00:07:26.805 --> 00:07:28.473
He sleeps there.

00:07:29.107 --> 00:07:30.408
Thank you.

00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:36.247
It's still warm.

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:37.182
He just left.

00:07:37.182 --> 00:07:37.982
Let's wait for him.

00:07:37.982 --> 00:07:39.384
The count is full!

00:07:39.384 --> 00:07:44.522
[Evil laughter]

00:07:46.024 --> 00:07:48.393
This is an Eggman Update!

00:07:48.393 --> 00:07:51.029
I'm here to bring you an explosive surprise!

00:07:52.797 --> 00:07:54.599
What's he up to now?

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:56.368
Look in the sky!

00:07:56.368 --> 00:07:57.469
The sky?

00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:03.041
I'm comin' to you planet-bound
bumpkins live from outer space!

00:08:03.041 --> 00:08:05.744
[Evil laughter]

00:08:05.744 --> 00:08:09.247
Let me show you the true
power of the Eggman Empire!

00:08:09.247 --> 00:08:10.281
Huh.

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:12.283
What's Eggman gonna do?

00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:14.119
[Chuckling]

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:15.653
Huh.

00:08:16.187 --> 00:08:18.523
Now, let's have a blast!

00:08:31.503 --> 00:08:34.672
Ah!

00:08:41.212 --> 00:08:43.615
[Evil laughter]

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.023
[Lasers firing]

00:08:59.097 --> 00:09:00.098
Woah!

00:09:00.098 --> 00:09:01.099
Ah!

00:09:05.437 --> 00:09:06.404
[People screaming]

00:09:07.372 --> 00:09:09.307
Oh! Ah!

00:09:09.307 --> 00:09:10.408
Ah!

00:09:13.411 --> 00:09:14.379
Oh!

00:09:14.712 --> 00:09:16.281
[People screaming]

00:09:20.819 --> 00:09:22.287
The moon was so pretty!

00:09:22.287 --> 00:09:24.289
Why did Dr. Eggman wreck it?

00:09:24.289 --> 00:09:27.559
It takes huge amounts of energy
to do that much damage!

00:09:27.559 --> 00:09:28.726
Chaos Emeralds.

00:09:28.726 --> 00:09:30.195
If Eggman's got enough of 'em,

00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:32.764
he can use their power
to make a super weapon.

00:09:32.764 --> 00:09:33.465
Hmm.

00:09:35.266 --> 00:09:36.234
With that much power,

00:09:36.234 --> 00:09:38.603
Eggman can blow up any planet he wants!

00:09:38.603 --> 00:09:40.872
Eggman wans't lying about the Eclipse Cannon.

00:09:40.872 --> 00:09:42.273
It <i>is</i> the ultimate weapon.

00:09:42.273 --> 00:09:45.276
[Evil laughter]

00:09:48.179 --> 00:09:50.181
That came from my Eclipse Cannon.

00:09:50.181 --> 00:09:54.385
And, if you don't surrender to the
Eggman Empire within 24 hours,

00:09:54.385 --> 00:09:56.321
I'll blow your planet away!

00:09:56.321 --> 00:09:57.522
[Evil chuckle]

00:09:57.522 --> 00:09:58.710
I gotta find a way to stop him!

00:10:20.135 --> 00:10:23.138
Today, it's finally going to come to an end.

00:10:23.138 --> 00:10:24.139
Huh?

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:37.286
Shadow, why did you bring me here?

00:10:45.861 --> 00:10:49.498
Are you going to stare out
that window all day, Shadow?

00:10:51.433 --> 00:10:53.836
I've seen photographs
from down on the surface,

00:10:53.836 --> 00:10:56.271
but I wonder what it's like to be there.

00:10:56.271 --> 00:10:58.674
What is it like to see
the sky above your head?

00:10:58.674 --> 00:11:00.809
I'd like to visit there and find out.

00:11:00.809 --> 00:11:02.744
Me too.

00:11:03.112 --> 00:11:05.481
Maybe I can find some answers down there.

00:11:05.481 --> 00:11:08.016
Professor Robotnik said I'm
here to do something important,

00:11:08.016 --> 00:11:10.285
though he never told me what that means.

00:11:10.285 --> 00:11:13.322
But something tells me that it's
connected with that planet.

00:11:18.127 --> 00:11:19.895
Don't you ever smile?

00:11:20.863 --> 00:11:21.830
Hi, Chris.

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:23.765
Hello, Rouge.

00:11:23.765 --> 00:11:26.668
Aren't <i>you</i> glad to see me, Shadow?

00:11:27.402 --> 00:11:30.439
I love it when you give
me the silent treatment.

00:11:35.077 --> 00:11:37.079
What's with Mr. Sunshine?

00:11:45.087 --> 00:11:46.588
Almost done.

00:11:46.588 --> 00:11:49.424
I hope these modifications
work so we can go save Chris.

00:11:49.424 --> 00:11:52.194
But one Chaos Emerald isn't
gonna give us enough power

00:11:52.194 --> 00:11:54.396
to make it all the way into space.

00:11:54.396 --> 00:11:56.431
But one is all we've got, Tails.

00:11:56.431 --> 00:11:57.833
We've got two!

00:11:58.867 --> 00:11:59.635
[Giggles]

00:11:59.635 --> 00:12:02.271
You... made a copy of an Emerald?

00:12:02.271 --> 00:12:04.439
It isn't a perfect copy, Chuck,

00:12:04.439 --> 00:12:06.842
but the power it produces is almost the same!

00:12:06.842 --> 00:12:09.344
Come on, let's try it out!

00:12:16.952 --> 00:12:20.155
Maybe he spotted us coming
and it scared him off.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.029
Sonic ran over here!

00:12:29.331 --> 00:12:31.266
It went this way!

00:12:34.303 --> 00:12:36.038
[Giggling]

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.108
You won't escape, pal!

00:12:41.043 --> 00:12:43.011
[Grunting]

00:12:44.947 --> 00:12:46.882
[Grunting]

00:12:50.285 --> 00:12:51.753
Guess I lost 'em.

00:12:54.156 --> 00:12:55.524
What's that?

00:12:57.593 --> 00:13:01.196
[Sounds of fighting]

00:13:01.196 --> 00:13:02.764
Where've you been?

00:13:02.764 --> 00:13:04.499
Hey, how's it goin', Knuckles?

00:13:04.499 --> 00:13:07.169
Not bad, except that I'm in the
middle of a battle right now!

00:13:07.169 --> 00:13:08.670
Oof!

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:09.571
Woah, boy!

00:13:09.571 --> 00:13:10.872
[Grunting]

00:13:12.341 --> 00:13:15.844
It's lucky my reflexes are
quicker than Knuckles' temper!

00:13:18.213 --> 00:13:18.780
Uh!

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:20.916
[Sounds of fighting]

00:13:27.589 --> 00:13:31.460
[Fighting]

00:13:32.394 --> 00:13:33.462
Hyaa!

00:13:35.163 --> 00:13:37.032
He's only distracting them!

00:13:37.032 --> 00:13:38.100
Quick, follow me!

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.601
Ah!

00:13:41.536 --> 00:13:43.272
Tell me what your demands are,

00:13:43.272 --> 00:13:44.773
and perhaps we can work out an agreement.

00:13:44.773 --> 00:13:46.575
[Evil chuckle]

00:13:46.575 --> 00:13:49.111
Mr. President, that's very reasonable of you.

00:13:49.111 --> 00:13:50.812
I only have one demand to make,

00:13:50.812 --> 00:13:52.547
if you want to escape my wrath.

00:13:52.547 --> 00:13:53.949
And if you fail to comply,

00:13:53.949 --> 00:13:55.817
I have one penalty.

00:13:55.817 --> 00:13:58.186
Either you agree to become part of my empire,

00:13:58.186 --> 00:13:59.688
or else...

00:13:59.688 --> 00:14:01.657
Or else, what?

00:14:01.657 --> 00:14:04.860
Your entire planet will be blown to bits!

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.295
Hm...

00:14:06.862 --> 00:14:09.197
Well? What is your answer?

00:14:09.197 --> 00:14:11.300
Ugh. I can't!

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.035
You can't, what?

00:14:13.935 --> 00:14:15.937
I can't give you an answer.

00:14:15.937 --> 00:14:16.705
Not yet.

00:14:16.705 --> 00:14:17.873
You're just stalling,

00:14:17.873 --> 00:14:22.110
trying to give your military enough time
to organize a counterattack against me.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.046
It is useless to resist.

00:14:24.046 --> 00:14:26.715
I expect your answer within 12 hours.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:29.651
What can I do?

00:14:29.651 --> 00:14:33.755
12 hours is not enough time to stop
him from destroying the planet.

00:14:33.755 --> 00:14:34.990
[Knocking]

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:36.158
Huh?

00:14:36.158 --> 00:14:40.162
Ya know, there is a bright side
to all this, Mr. President.

00:14:40.162 --> 00:14:40.762
[Sigh]

00:14:40.762 --> 00:14:41.863
What might that be?

00:14:41.863 --> 00:14:43.198
If the planet's destroyed,

00:14:43.198 --> 00:14:46.034
you won't have to worry about
balancing the budget anymore!

00:14:46.034 --> 00:14:47.002
[Wink]

00:14:49.738 --> 00:14:51.606
So you found Eggman's base,

00:14:51.606 --> 00:14:53.642
but did you find out what happened to Chris?

00:14:53.642 --> 00:14:55.644
Shadow took him up into space.

00:14:55.644 --> 00:14:58.647
And I think the bat who stole the
Master Emerald was with him, too.

00:14:58.647 --> 00:14:59.614
Really.

00:14:59.614 --> 00:15:01.316
I'll teach her a lesson.

00:15:01.316 --> 00:15:03.251
There is Eggman's base.

00:15:09.758 --> 00:15:11.693
This place could be dangerous,

00:15:11.693 --> 00:15:13.762
so be careful, Cream and Cheese.

00:15:13.762 --> 00:15:15.197
We will, Amy!

00:15:15.197 --> 00:15:15.697
Chao!

00:15:15.697 --> 00:15:17.332
Stick with Mr. Tanaka.

00:15:17.332 --> 00:15:20.068
Sonic and the others are entering the base.

00:15:20.068 --> 00:15:21.570
I'll follow them in.

00:15:30.312 --> 00:15:31.279
Oof!

00:15:32.114 --> 00:15:33.215
Hmm!

00:15:33.215 --> 00:15:35.050
No luck.

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:36.752
There is a keyhole,

00:15:36.752 --> 00:15:39.554
which means there must be a key somewhere.

00:15:40.322 --> 00:15:42.290
Hey, why you lookin' at me?

00:15:42.791 --> 00:15:44.459
Well, you're a treasure hunter.

00:15:44.459 --> 00:15:45.794
Can't you find it?

00:15:45.794 --> 00:15:48.163
No way! A key isn't a treasure.

00:15:49.131 --> 00:15:51.933
A real treasure hunter should
not have any difficulty

00:15:51.933 --> 00:15:54.202
finding something as simple as a key.

00:15:54.202 --> 00:15:56.138
How do we know you haven't been pretending

00:15:56.138 --> 00:15:58.306
to be a treasure hunter all this time?

00:15:58.306 --> 00:16:00.275
Maybe Knuckles is a treasure hunter,

00:16:00.275 --> 00:16:01.943
but he's just not a very good one.

00:16:01.943 --> 00:16:03.945
Fine! I'll look.

00:16:03.945 --> 00:16:05.280
[Grumble]

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.883
This is exactly why I like to work alone!

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:09.017
Wha?

00:16:09.017 --> 00:16:11.253
I hope you know you're trespassing, Knuckles!

00:16:11.253 --> 00:16:12.621
[Grumble]

00:16:12.988 --> 00:16:15.824
I don't have time to play
any games with you, Bokkun.

00:16:15.824 --> 00:16:16.825
Scram!

00:16:16.825 --> 00:16:18.660
If you don't leave on your own,

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.695
I'm gonna have to make you leave!

00:16:20.695 --> 00:16:22.030
Oh yeah?

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:22.864
[Grunt]

00:16:22.864 --> 00:16:23.732
No!

00:16:23.732 --> 00:16:25.467
I have to go find that key!

00:16:26.101 --> 00:16:27.135
Huh?

00:16:28.136 --> 00:16:29.337
I warned ya!

00:16:29.938 --> 00:16:31.273
[Giggling]

00:16:32.007 --> 00:16:34.009
Go clobber 'em, Egg Golem!

00:16:39.614 --> 00:16:40.348
Huh?

00:16:40.682 --> 00:16:41.750
Oh!

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:42.551
Chao!

00:16:42.551 --> 00:16:44.619
Knuckles found the key already?

00:16:44.619 --> 00:16:45.520
'Fraid not.

00:16:48.356 --> 00:16:50.525
Looks like Knuckles ran into some trouble.

00:16:50.525 --> 00:16:52.260
About 15 tons of it!

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.095
Let's give this a try.

00:16:55.163 --> 00:16:56.131
Oof!

00:16:56.298 --> 00:16:57.098
[Grunt]

00:16:57.098 --> 00:16:58.433
I got the door open.

00:16:58.433 --> 00:16:59.534
Now are ya happy?

00:16:59.534 --> 00:17:00.635
I guess.

00:17:08.143 --> 00:17:09.744
Here's the spin cycle!

00:17:11.746 --> 00:17:12.681
Oof!

00:17:12.981 --> 00:17:13.915
Oof!

00:17:13.915 --> 00:17:15.350
I'll stop that thing!

00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:16.051
[Grunt]

00:17:18.186 --> 00:17:19.688
[Yelling]

00:17:19.688 --> 00:17:21.623
Here's the claptrap!

00:17:21.623 --> 00:17:22.524
Oof!

00:17:23.024 --> 00:17:24.526
Oof! Ugh!

00:17:24.526 --> 00:17:25.560
[Grunt]

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.528
[Giggling]

00:17:26.528 --> 00:17:27.496
Nice going!

00:17:27.496 --> 00:17:29.397
You really hammered those guys!

00:17:29.397 --> 00:17:31.933
[Both groaning]

00:17:31.933 --> 00:17:33.568
Have you had enough?

00:17:33.568 --> 00:17:35.570
Yeah, I think we can finish it off now.

00:17:40.642 --> 00:17:41.643
[Yelling]

00:17:42.777 --> 00:17:44.479
Give him a headbutt again!

00:17:46.214 --> 00:17:46.982
[Grunt]

00:17:47.349 --> 00:17:50.785
Woaaaaah!

00:17:53.455 --> 00:17:54.990
Well, that was easy.

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:56.057
Piece of cake.

00:17:56.057 --> 00:17:57.759
Not so fast!

00:17:57.759 --> 00:17:58.760
Ha!

00:18:02.564 --> 00:18:04.533
Give it up, Bokkun.

00:18:04.533 --> 00:18:06.601
No way! Look what I've got!

00:18:06.601 --> 00:18:07.669
[Giggling]

00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:08.522
[Yelling]

00:18:13.902 --> 00:18:16.171
Oh, great. Why's she here?

00:18:16.171 --> 00:18:18.173
[Giggling]

00:18:18.173 --> 00:18:22.010
Hyaaaaaaa hyaaaaaaa!

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:24.847
Hey, no fair! Gimme back my controller!

00:18:24.847 --> 00:18:26.181
Finders, keepers!

00:18:26.181 --> 00:18:26.682
[Giggling]

00:18:26.682 --> 00:18:27.883
Chao chao chao!

00:18:28.384 --> 00:18:29.518
[Giggling]

00:18:32.554 --> 00:18:33.489
Woah!

00:18:33.489 --> 00:18:35.891
[Screaming]

00:18:35.891 --> 00:18:39.695
[Panicked yelling]

00:18:39.695 --> 00:18:41.263
Leave me alone!

00:18:41.263 --> 00:18:50.572
[Panicked yelling]

00:18:54.743 --> 00:18:56.145
Woah!

00:18:58.614 --> 00:19:02.451
No! Don't chase me, motorbrain! [Crying]

00:19:02.451 --> 00:19:05.120
I hope that brute did not harm you, miss.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.288
I'm fine.

00:19:13.362 --> 00:19:14.663
There's the base!

00:19:19.001 --> 00:19:20.269
I'll land inside.

00:19:30.612 --> 00:19:32.047
I did it, Sonic!

00:19:32.047 --> 00:19:35.117
I adapted the X Tornado so
we can take it into space!

00:19:35.117 --> 00:19:36.051
Uh...

00:19:36.752 --> 00:19:40.055
We might have a little problem, though.

00:19:41.156 --> 00:19:42.724
It only seats four.

00:19:42.724 --> 00:19:44.393
If you're bringing Chris back,

00:19:44.393 --> 00:19:46.228
only two of us can ride with you.

00:19:46.962 --> 00:19:48.230
Yeah, that's right.

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.766
Then let's take this space shuttle!

00:19:52.334 --> 00:19:53.969
I agree with Sonic.

00:19:53.969 --> 00:19:55.304
Yeah.

00:19:55.304 --> 00:19:57.706
Guess I did all that work for nothing.

00:19:57.706 --> 00:19:59.708
What about Cream and Cheese?

00:19:59.708 --> 00:20:01.810
Well, I could take care of them.

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:03.412
Thank you, miss.

00:20:04.046 --> 00:20:05.347
Sure.

00:20:05.347 --> 00:20:07.916
Okay! Then let's get going!

00:20:08.383 --> 00:20:10.152
Ten, nine,

00:20:10.152 --> 00:20:11.753
eight, seven,

00:20:11.753 --> 00:20:13.689
six, five,

00:20:13.689 --> 00:20:15.757
four, three,

00:20:15.757 --> 00:20:17.493
two, one.

00:20:17.493 --> 00:20:18.460
Ignition!

00:20:30.372 --> 00:20:33.108
Hang on, Chris. Hang on.
