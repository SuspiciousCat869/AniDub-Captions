WEBVTT

00:00:00.501 --> 00:00:01.902
Last time on Sonic X,

00:00:01.902 --> 00:00:04.805
while locked up in jail,
Dr. Eggman worked overtime

00:00:04.805 --> 00:00:07.241
to set a treacherous trap
for Sonic and friends.

00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:10.744
Hordes of household appliances soon
developed menacing malfunctions,

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:13.013
turning Chris' kitchen
into a combat zone.

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:16.016
As a vaccuum robot threatened
to clean Sonic's clock,

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.251
Emerl spun to the rescue,

00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:19.620
and a whole gang of
gadgets were washed out.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.955
Sonic raced to rock
the remaining robots,

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:23.257
but he and Knuckles were ambushed

00:00:23.257 --> 00:00:25.259
by mobs of mechanical marauders.

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.394
Our heroes seemed headed
for a crushing defeat

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:29.530
until Chris' family
helped turn the tide.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.699
Taking advantage of the confusion,
Eggman escaped from jail

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.235
and went into hiding to plot
his next monstrous move.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:38.005
Can the devious doctor be stopped
before he strikes again?

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:40.007
Find out next on Sonic X!

00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:41.775
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:44.878
Gotta go fast

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:47.814
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:53.620
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.689
Got ourselves a situation

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:57.724
Stuck in a new location

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:01.328
Without any explanation

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:03.397
No talk of relaxation

00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:05.032
Don't, don't, don't

00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:06.833
Don't blink, don't think

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:08.602
Just go, go, go, go

00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:10.103
Go, go

00:01:13.774 --> 00:01:15.676
Sonic is on the run

00:01:15.676 --> 00:01:17.578
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:21.281
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:24.985
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:27.387
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:29.289
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.792
Sonic X

00:01:31.792 --> 00:01:33.727
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:36.530
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.564
Sonic X

00:01:48.857 --> 00:01:50.425
"Eggman Escapes"

00:01:51.092 --> 00:01:54.763
The press'll have a field
day, and I don't blame them.

00:01:56.064 --> 00:01:57.966
We nab the world's greatest menace

00:01:57.966 --> 00:02:00.435
and let him slip right
through our fingers.

00:02:00.435 --> 00:02:02.404
How could this have happened?

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:07.242
We just have to do whatever
it takes to find him.

00:02:08.443 --> 00:02:10.145
He's out there somewhere,

00:02:10.145 --> 00:02:12.747
dreaming up another scheme
to take over the world.

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:17.786
We have to capture him
before he strikes again.

00:02:19.854 --> 00:02:22.857
I think it's got to be your
number one priority, sir.

00:02:22.857 --> 00:02:24.359
Topaz!

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:28.229
He's probably hiding under a
rock with the rest of the worms.

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:29.831
Hello, Rouge.

00:02:30.432 --> 00:02:33.001
TOPAZ: Do you have any idea
where Eggman might be, sir?

00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:36.638
No, but we have agents everywhere
looking high and low for him.

00:02:41.042 --> 00:02:42.877
This won't be easy.

00:02:42.877 --> 00:02:45.280
Eggman could be anywhere.

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.517
If you two can track down Eggman

00:02:49.517 --> 00:02:52.220
and put him out of business,
you can name your own reward.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.555
Really?

00:02:53.555 --> 00:02:55.390
Gold, diamonds, rubies...

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.925
whatever you like.

00:02:56.925 --> 00:02:58.560
I love them all.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.463
They're bright and
beautiful... like me.

00:03:01.463 --> 00:03:02.797
[Chuckling]

00:03:02.797 --> 00:03:04.566
Oh, brother.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.068
Just find Eggman.

00:03:09.037 --> 00:03:11.239
All right! School's out!

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.440
[Laughing]

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.875
Let's go play!

00:03:13.875 --> 00:03:16.411
Hey, you guys seen Timmy anywhere?

00:03:18.146 --> 00:03:21.049
I wonder what adventures
Sonic's having today.

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.584
He sure is lucky.

00:03:22.584 --> 00:03:26.154
Sonic gets to travel all around
having fun and helping people.

00:03:26.154 --> 00:03:29.524
Chris, did Sonic tell you where
he was runnin' off to today?

00:03:29.524 --> 00:03:30.692
I asked him.

00:03:30.692 --> 00:03:31.660
You did?

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.562
Yeah, he said he'd know where
he was going when he got there.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.165
I'll see ya later!

00:03:37.165 --> 00:03:38.433
[Grunt]

00:03:40.935 --> 00:03:42.637
That's kind of funny.

00:03:42.637 --> 00:03:43.905
That's Sonic.

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:44.873
Hm.

00:03:44.873 --> 00:03:46.474
[Laughing]

00:03:46.474 --> 00:03:47.709
Hi, Chris!

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.444
Chao chao chao!

00:03:49.444 --> 00:03:50.545
Hey, you guys!

00:03:50.545 --> 00:03:53.114
I didn't expect to
see you down here.

00:03:53.114 --> 00:03:56.484
Cheese and I wanted to give Emerl
a tour of the neighborhood.

00:03:56.484 --> 00:03:58.553
Next we're planning
to show him the park.

00:03:58.553 --> 00:04:00.822
Cream and Cheese found
this robot in my yard,

00:04:00.822 --> 00:04:02.691
and now he's staying
at my house, too.

00:04:02.691 --> 00:04:04.626
That's cool.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.295
There's Mr. Stewart.

00:04:11.166 --> 00:04:13.134
Hmm. I wonder.

00:04:14.636 --> 00:04:16.237
This tree is huge.

00:04:16.237 --> 00:04:19.841
If the trunk is hollow, Eggman
could be hiding inside.

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:22.310
Hmm.

00:04:34.022 --> 00:04:36.758
DECOE AND BOCOE: Oh! oh! oh!

00:04:36.758 --> 00:04:37.692
Huh?

00:04:37.692 --> 00:04:39.360
Oh! oh!

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.762
They're on our trail!

00:04:40.762 --> 00:04:42.731
We must warn Dr. Eggman!

00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:43.331
Hey!

00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:45.066
CHRIS: Mr. Stewart?
STEWART: Huh?

00:04:45.066 --> 00:04:47.335
Huh? Oh!

00:04:48.336 --> 00:04:50.238
What's wrong, Mr. Stewart?

00:04:51.473 --> 00:04:54.075
Are you playing hide-and-seek
with somebody?

00:04:54.075 --> 00:04:55.710
No, I'm bird-watching.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.512
Hey, let me see.

00:04:57.512 --> 00:04:58.646
Uh...

00:05:00.248 --> 00:05:01.816
Whoa!

00:05:01.816 --> 00:05:04.285
You can see everything with these!

00:05:04.285 --> 00:05:06.221
Danny, let me try!

00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:07.489
Huh?

00:05:11.126 --> 00:05:13.895
Hey, there's Dr. Eggman!

00:05:14.863 --> 00:05:16.798
Looks like he's buying a book.

00:05:16.798 --> 00:05:18.032
Really?

00:05:18.032 --> 00:05:19.400
My turn!

00:05:20.435 --> 00:05:21.836
It is him!

00:05:22.837 --> 00:05:23.805
Awesome!

00:05:23.805 --> 00:05:25.340
If we hurry, we can catch him!

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.441
ALL: Yeah!

00:05:26.441 --> 00:05:27.709
No! You can't!

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:29.978
Capturing Dr. Eggman
is too dangerous!

00:05:29.978 --> 00:05:31.279
That's a job for the police.

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:33.214
I'll phone the authorities
and let them know.

00:05:33.214 --> 00:05:35.150
You kids should go
home immediately!

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.285
Do not go after Dr.
Eggman, understand?

00:05:37.285 --> 00:05:39.454
Don't even think about
trying it, okay?

00:05:39.454 --> 00:05:42.857
I think Mr. Stewart is right
that we should all head home.

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:46.161
Then let's go. [sigh]

00:05:46.161 --> 00:05:47.629
KID 1: Later.
KID 2: Bye-bye.

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.695
See ya.
KID 1: Later.
KID 2: Bye-bye.

00:05:47.695 --> 00:05:48.663
See ya.

00:05:48.663 --> 00:05:50.098
Bye, Mr. Stewart!

00:05:50.098 --> 00:05:51.566
Wait up, Chris!

00:05:56.137 --> 00:06:00.208
I'll tail Dr. Eggman and try to
figure out what his next move is.

00:06:02.143 --> 00:06:04.212
Yo, taxi!

00:06:04.212 --> 00:06:05.814
Uh! Huh!

00:06:05.814 --> 00:06:08.016
[grunting]

00:06:08.016 --> 00:06:11.586
[Laughter]

00:06:11.586 --> 00:06:14.289
Woah! Hey! What do you
kids think you're doing?

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:16.191
I thought you were all going home!

00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:17.992
You can drive us all home

00:06:17.992 --> 00:06:20.528
after we catch Dr.
Eggman, of course.

00:06:20.528 --> 00:06:21.996
[Sigh]

00:06:21.996 --> 00:06:23.364
Great.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.241
[Sigh]

00:06:34.342 --> 00:06:35.844
[Content sigh]

00:06:35.844 --> 00:06:37.245
Sonic!

00:06:37.245 --> 00:06:37.779
Huh?

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:38.546
Sonic!

00:06:38.546 --> 00:06:39.681
Hm?

00:06:40.348 --> 00:06:44.185
Do you know if Chris had anything
special to do after school today?

00:06:44.185 --> 00:06:45.887
He hasn't arrived back home yet,

00:06:45.887 --> 00:06:47.655
and Cream and Cheese
are also missing.

00:06:49.224 --> 00:06:50.758
I hope they're okay.

00:06:58.099 --> 00:06:59.734
The taxi's pulling over!

00:07:09.244 --> 00:07:11.212
Where's he going?

00:07:12.747 --> 00:07:14.148
[All gasp]

00:07:16.918 --> 00:07:18.386
He got out,

00:07:18.386 --> 00:07:20.321
but he disappeared!

00:07:21.556 --> 00:07:25.393
There are no fire escapes in this
alley, and I don't see any doors.

00:07:27.929 --> 00:07:29.564
Hmm.

00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:36.537
What are you doing, Mr. Stewart?

00:07:42.944 --> 00:07:53.121
[Sound of footsteps]

00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:54.522
Eggman's underground.

00:07:54.522 --> 00:07:55.189
What?

00:07:55.189 --> 00:07:56.157
Underground?

00:07:56.157 --> 00:07:57.425
How'd he get there?

00:07:57.425 --> 00:07:59.294
Down there!

00:08:05.833 --> 00:08:13.775
[All screaming]

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:23.651
All right!

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.555
[Screaming]

00:08:27.555 --> 00:08:29.524
What's the matter, Danny?

00:08:29.524 --> 00:08:31.626
There's a lizard in the car!

00:08:31.626 --> 00:08:32.794
Where?

00:08:33.828 --> 00:08:34.929
Right there!

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:36.564
Aww...!

00:08:40.735 --> 00:08:41.636
[Groan]

00:08:41.636 --> 00:08:43.571
Danny, you don't really believe

00:08:43.571 --> 00:08:46.240
that harmless, little lizard
was going to hurt you!

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.343
You're not scared of lizards?

00:08:48.343 --> 00:08:49.844
Of course not!

00:08:49.844 --> 00:08:51.612
I catch them all the time!

00:08:51.612 --> 00:08:52.981
Oh, really?

00:08:52.981 --> 00:08:55.416
She catches snakes and bugs, too.

00:08:55.416 --> 00:08:56.918
[Shudder]

00:08:56.918 --> 00:08:59.587
[Giggling]

00:08:59.587 --> 00:09:01.522
You must be crazy.

00:09:01.522 --> 00:09:03.191
You're a baby!

00:09:03.191 --> 00:09:04.592
That's enough.

00:09:04.592 --> 00:09:07.595
This is no time to
start an argument.

00:09:07.595 --> 00:09:10.498
Remember, we came to stop Eggman.

00:09:10.798 --> 00:09:12.000
Uhh!

00:09:14.135 --> 00:09:15.436
Huh!

00:09:20.675 --> 00:09:23.077
[Evil chuckling]

00:09:28.182 --> 00:09:30.885
Faster, Mr. Stewart!
Don't let him get away!

00:09:33.488 --> 00:09:35.890
I'll stop them with my net work!

00:09:39.894 --> 00:09:46.100
[All screaming]

00:09:59.504 --> 00:10:00.972
How's your dessert?

00:10:00.972 --> 00:10:02.407
Dreamy.

00:10:02.407 --> 00:10:05.310
Instead of eating, we should
be looking for Eggman.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:07.212
I'm sure he'll turn up soon.

00:10:07.212 --> 00:10:10.816
Eggman's too full of himself to
stay out of the spotlight long.

00:10:10.816 --> 00:10:12.517
That's true.

00:10:13.018 --> 00:10:15.687
It certainly has gotten breezy.

00:10:15.687 --> 00:10:17.856
You don't suppose
it's Sonic, do you?

00:10:17.856 --> 00:10:20.192
I'm sure it's him.

00:10:20.192 --> 00:10:21.727
I wonder what he's up to?

00:10:23.428 --> 00:10:25.097
Sonic!

00:10:25.097 --> 00:10:27.566
Why are you whippin'
around like a tornado?

00:10:27.566 --> 00:10:30.102
SONIC: I'm looking for Chris.
ROUGE: How come?

00:10:30.102 --> 00:10:31.703
He never came home from school.

00:10:31.703 --> 00:10:33.371
Cream and Cheese are missing, too.

00:10:33.371 --> 00:10:36.074
If you happen to run into
Eggman, let us know.

00:10:36.074 --> 00:10:37.375
[Chuckling]

00:10:41.113 --> 00:10:43.081
I think I'll have some coffee.

00:10:43.081 --> 00:10:44.816
Me too.

00:10:53.458 --> 00:10:55.961
[Evil laughter]

00:10:55.961 --> 00:10:57.395
GIRL: Excuse me.
EGGMAN: Huh?

00:10:57.395 --> 00:11:00.298
How come you're carrying
around all those books?

00:11:00.298 --> 00:11:03.235
I'm doing some research
for my new attack plan.

00:11:03.235 --> 00:11:05.437
What are you planning on doing?

00:11:05.437 --> 00:11:07.105
It's going to be big.

00:11:07.105 --> 00:11:09.407
Oh! You shouldn't be so nosy, kid.

00:11:09.407 --> 00:11:11.443
Especially when you're
trapped in a sewer!

00:11:11.443 --> 00:11:13.211
Dr. Eggman!

00:11:13.211 --> 00:11:15.347
What do you two bolt heads want?

00:11:15.347 --> 00:11:18.350
Look! We found this inside the car.

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:19.651
Uhh!

00:11:19.651 --> 00:11:21.520
It must belong to him.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.387
Oh! Uhh...

00:11:22.387 --> 00:11:24.156
Why do you have this equipment?

00:11:24.156 --> 00:11:25.123
Are you a spy?

00:11:25.123 --> 00:11:26.324
Of course not!

00:11:26.324 --> 00:11:28.927
Then what are you so nervous about?

00:11:28.927 --> 00:11:31.496
I thought spies were
supposed to be cool...

00:11:31.496 --> 00:11:32.697
not wimpy.

00:11:32.697 --> 00:11:33.698
I know.

00:11:33.698 --> 00:11:37.302
Try to imagine Mr.
Stewart as a spy.

00:11:44.309 --> 00:11:46.211
[Cowering]

00:11:46.211 --> 00:11:48.814
Professional spies stay
cool under pressure.

00:11:48.814 --> 00:11:51.383
He's shaking like a
goldfish in a shark tank.

00:11:51.383 --> 00:11:55.353
Sorry to leave you, but I have to go
prepare my next mind-blowing attack.

00:11:55.353 --> 00:11:56.888
Toodle-oo!

00:11:57.923 --> 00:11:59.724
[Sigh]

00:11:59.724 --> 00:12:01.793
BOCOE: Why are you
acting so relieved?

00:12:01.793 --> 00:12:02.527
[Panic]

00:12:02.527 --> 00:12:04.596
Maybe he is a spy after all.

00:12:04.596 --> 00:12:06.198
I'm a schoolteacher.

00:12:06.198 --> 00:12:07.999
It's true. He used
to be our teacher

00:12:07.999 --> 00:12:09.367
'til he got transferred.

00:12:09.367 --> 00:12:10.302
There. You see?

00:12:10.302 --> 00:12:11.403
Oh!

00:12:12.504 --> 00:12:14.072
Hey, can you guys tell us about

00:12:14.072 --> 00:12:16.274
this new attack Dr.
Eggman's planning?

00:12:16.274 --> 00:12:18.977
You will not get any
information out of us!

00:12:18.977 --> 00:12:20.378
We will never talk,

00:12:20.378 --> 00:12:22.514
because Dr. Eggman never
tells us anything.

00:12:22.514 --> 00:12:24.683
[Cry] We get no respect.

00:12:24.683 --> 00:12:26.384
And no time off, either.

00:12:26.384 --> 00:12:29.521
We'd better go dry our
tears before we rust.

00:12:29.521 --> 00:12:31.323
[Crying]

00:12:31.323 --> 00:12:33.825
Those two should get
their bolts tightened.

00:12:35.393 --> 00:12:38.396
We should try to get out
while nobody's guarding us.

00:12:38.396 --> 00:12:40.599
Helen, may I borrow this?

00:12:41.833 --> 00:12:42.934
Huh?

00:12:50.475 --> 00:12:51.576
ALL: Oh!

00:12:51.576 --> 00:12:52.878
Shh!

00:12:54.946 --> 00:12:57.482
Come on. we have to move fast.

00:13:08.393 --> 00:13:12.097
Wouldn't it be cool if it turns
out Mr. Stewart is really a spy?

00:13:12.097 --> 00:13:13.698
In your dreams!

00:13:20.739 --> 00:13:22.674
I guess we're trapped...

00:13:22.674 --> 00:13:24.209
Not yet!

00:13:25.744 --> 00:13:26.678
Huh?

00:13:28.713 --> 00:13:31.950
Let me show you a little
chemistry experiment.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.686
When I mix the acid
in the blue bottle

00:13:34.686 --> 00:13:37.188
with the chemical solution
in the brown bottle,

00:13:37.188 --> 00:13:39.891
the reaction is
<i>very</i> interesting.

00:13:39.891 --> 00:13:41.159
Now stay back!

00:13:41.159 --> 00:13:41.760
Huh?

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.128
[Explosion] Aah!

00:13:46.064 --> 00:13:46.998
Ah!

00:13:46.998 --> 00:13:48.700
It did it!

00:13:50.402 --> 00:13:55.707
[Panting]

00:13:55.707 --> 00:13:57.142
[Grunt] Ah!

00:14:04.649 --> 00:14:08.687
The only way to open this electronic
lock is to find the password.

00:14:14.025 --> 00:14:15.160
Got it!

00:14:17.996 --> 00:14:19.097
Eggman?

00:14:19.097 --> 00:14:22.200
So all you have to do is type
in "Eggman" to open the door?

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.136
No, Chris. That would be too easy.

00:14:25.136 --> 00:14:26.805
Something's not right.

00:14:26.805 --> 00:14:28.039
Why not?

00:14:28.039 --> 00:14:29.674
It's a trap!

00:14:36.815 --> 00:14:39.851
I can't take the chance and
put the kids in danger.

00:14:39.851 --> 00:14:42.454
We'll have to get this
door open another way.

00:14:42.454 --> 00:14:43.822
But how?

00:14:43.822 --> 00:14:45.757
Huh...

00:14:46.825 --> 00:14:48.960
Maybe we should try knocking!

00:14:50.395 --> 00:14:53.498
It would be easy to get out
if only we could reach Sonic.

00:14:53.498 --> 00:14:54.699
Hm...

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.802
Huh.

00:14:58.203 --> 00:15:00.005

00:15:05.677 --> 00:15:07.479
[Sigh]

00:15:07.479 --> 00:15:10.382
He must know how to
get us out of here!

00:15:11.316 --> 00:15:14.452
Helen! What if we- [whispering]

00:15:15.787 --> 00:15:17.088
Okay!

00:15:18.056 --> 00:15:19.624
I don't know how she does it,

00:15:19.624 --> 00:15:22.594
but Ella bakes the most delicious
apple pies in the world!

00:15:24.996 --> 00:15:26.431
Oh?

00:15:26.431 --> 00:15:30.135
You haven't had apple pie 'til
you've tasted Ella's apple pie!

00:15:30.135 --> 00:15:32.103
Apple pie?!

00:15:35.673 --> 00:15:37.142
Can I have some?

00:15:37.142 --> 00:15:40.545
You can only taste Ella's apple
pie if you go to Chris' house!

00:15:40.545 --> 00:15:42.280
Go tell Ella you saw me here,

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.616
and I said she should
give you some pie!

00:15:44.616 --> 00:15:46.217
You bet I will!

00:15:46.217 --> 00:15:48.720
Yay! Apple pie, here I come!

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.555
Huh.

00:15:52.223 --> 00:15:56.094
If he tells Ella we're here,
she'll let Sonic know, too!

00:15:56.094 --> 00:15:57.729
And he'll come save us!

00:15:57.729 --> 00:15:59.497
That's right!

00:15:59.931 --> 00:16:04.903
[Straining]

00:16:04.903 --> 00:16:06.271
Apple pie...

00:16:06.271 --> 00:16:08.006
Apple pie...!

00:16:08.973 --> 00:16:10.909
Which way now?

00:16:10.909 --> 00:16:12.210
Hm...

00:16:13.044 --> 00:16:15.780
Aah!

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.849
Hiya, Bokkun!

00:16:17.849 --> 00:16:19.384
Where're ya goin'?

00:16:19.384 --> 00:16:23.121
I saw Chris in the sewer, and he
sent me to his house for some pie!

00:16:23.121 --> 00:16:24.389
The sewer?

00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:26.558
I didn't think of
looking underground!

00:16:26.558 --> 00:16:27.525
Huh?

00:16:27.525 --> 00:16:29.227
Eggman's probably there!

00:16:29.227 --> 00:16:31.930
Will you get a message to
Rouge and Topaz for me, pal?

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:33.331
No!

00:16:33.331 --> 00:16:36.901
If you love Ella's pie, you'll
love her strawberry shortcake.

00:16:36.901 --> 00:16:38.770
Strawberry shortcake?

00:16:41.773 --> 00:16:42.740
[Drooling]

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.776
Will she make me one?

00:16:44.776 --> 00:16:46.778
If you deliver my message.

00:16:49.247 --> 00:16:50.582
Mm.

00:16:50.582 --> 00:16:53.485
The chocolate's even
tastier than the vanilla.

00:16:53.485 --> 00:16:55.053
De-licious.

00:16:55.787 --> 00:16:58.289
I have a message for
you two from Sonic!

00:16:58.289 --> 00:16:59.491
Huh?

00:16:59.491 --> 00:17:01.059
He's in the sewer.

00:17:01.059 --> 00:17:02.594
He's in the sewer?

[All grunting with effort]

It's no use. You're just
wasting your energy.

00:17:11.903 --> 00:17:13.705
We have to think of something else.

00:17:13.705 --> 00:17:14.806
There's no escape!

00:17:14.806 --> 00:17:15.773
Huh?

00:17:18.776 --> 00:17:19.878
