00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.182
It's very impressive, isn't it?

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:16.083
That's it?

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:19.653
Project Beetle is only
a prototype, of course,

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:23.490
based on our analysis
of Dr. Eggman's technology.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.359
But if all goes as planned,

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:29.162
we'll soon have
our own working robot.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.199
The president considers
this project

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.934
to be a national priority.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.769
We won't let him down.

00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:48.348
What a fabulous display!

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:51.485
I wish I had
a rock collection like that.

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:52.619
You're a thief.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.923
I haven't stolen them yet,
Topaz.

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:59.826
So, then you are planning
a robbery, aren't you?

00:00:59.927 --> 00:01:01.795
Excuse me,
could somebody get the police

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:05.566
and tell them there's a thief
hiding back here?

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:07.568
Aah!

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:11.271
I know why you're so
passive-aggressive towards me.

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:14.608
You're jealous of me because
I'm the glamorous team member.

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:17.177
If you think I'm the least bit
jealous of you,

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:19.313
then you really are bats.

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.727

Hello.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.706
Thank you for visiting
our store, Mr. Thorndyke.

00:01:45.806 --> 00:01:48.475
Is there something
we can help you find?

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:51.712
Yes, I'm shopping for an
anniversary present for my wife.

00:01:51.812 --> 00:01:53.747
You've come to the right place,
sir.

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:56.783
We've got a full line
of matrimonial mementos

00:01:56.883 --> 00:02:00.387
guaranteed to make every
anniversary golden.

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:02.756
What's under there?

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:04.725
You have exquisite taste, sir.

00:02:04.825 --> 00:02:08.929
This item was acquired recently,
and it's truly one of a kind!

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:16.403
[All gasp]

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:17.871
It's a perfect gift.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:18.905
That's it!

00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:21.742
Lindsey is simply wild
about jewelry.

00:02:21.842 --> 00:02:24.745
How long will it take you
to have the ring ready?

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:27.748
But isn't that gem
a tad large for a ring?

00:02:27.848 --> 00:02:30.951
My wife definitely likes
flashy jewelry.

00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:32.519
It's our wedding anniversary,

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.721
and I want to get her
something special!

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.723
I can't wait to see
Lindsey's face

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:38.425
when I slip it on her finger.

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:39.993
Her birthday's coming up.

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:42.763
I'll tell you what.
Give me a couple diamonds, too.

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:44.931
Sure!

00:02:47.234 --> 00:02:48.869
TOGETHER: Thank you very much,
Mr. Thorndyke.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:52.372
Please feel free to stop
by our store anytime.

Don't, don't, don't

00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:22.669
Don't blink, don't think

TANAKA: Hello.
This is the Thorndyke residence.

00:04:04.404 --> 00:04:07.774
Hello, Tanaka.
How's everything going at home?

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:12.512
Everyone is doing very well
here, Mr. Thorndyke.

00:04:13.847 --> 00:04:17.217
Mr. Chris, I have Mr. Thorndyke
on the line for you.

00:04:17.317 --> 00:04:18.885
Oh, cool!

00:04:18.985 --> 00:04:21.922
Hold on.
I thought Chuck was here.

00:04:22.022 --> 00:04:23.390
He is.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.658
Thank you.

00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:27.094
Hey, there, how's it going, Dad?

00:04:27.194 --> 00:04:29.663
Are you calling from the office,
or are you traveling?

00:04:29.796 --> 00:04:32.799
Chris' father is
the Mr. Thorndyke on the phone.

00:04:32.933 --> 00:04:35.635
If it was Chuck,
he'd say, "Hello, Grandpa."

00:04:35.736 --> 00:04:38.739
Right.
It is Mr. Nelson Thorndyke.

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:41.041
You see?
I'm right!

00:04:41.141 --> 00:04:42.743
Yeah.
Now it's clear.

00:04:42.843 --> 00:04:44.378
She's not here.

00:04:44.478 --> 00:04:48.115
Mom is in Filmdom City this
whole week acting in a movie.

00:04:48.215 --> 00:04:49.383
If you need to reach her,

00:04:49.483 --> 00:04:52.552
you can call her
at the studio, though.

00:04:52.652 --> 00:04:55.489
Okay, I'll be there.

00:04:56.623 --> 00:04:58.024
I changed my mind.

00:04:58.125 --> 00:05:00.360
I want to go to Filmdom City
right away.

00:05:00.494 --> 00:05:01.995
Yes, sir.

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:07.067
That's weird.

00:05:07.167 --> 00:05:09.269
My dad wants us all
to go to Filmdom City,

00:05:09.403 --> 00:05:10.871
but he won't say why.

00:05:10.971 --> 00:05:12.739
Filmdom City?

Yeah!
Let's go!

00:05:17.177 --> 00:05:19.546
It sounds like fun.
Right, Cheese?

00:05:19.646 --> 00:05:20.580
Chao.

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:26.787
We're all set.

00:05:26.887 --> 00:05:30.791
So, Tails, how many
Chaos Emeralds do you need now?

00:05:30.891 --> 00:05:34.795
We have four,
and Knuckles is holding one.

00:05:34.895 --> 00:05:36.163
We need seven.

00:05:36.263 --> 00:05:38.165
Wow!
Just two more!

00:05:38.265 --> 00:05:41.034
Yeah, but we have to be
really careful now

00:05:41.134 --> 00:05:44.171
when we add new Chaos Emeralds
to the ones we have already.

00:05:44.271 --> 00:05:46.673
The four Chaos Emeralds
we have now are okay

00:05:46.773 --> 00:05:49.042
because they've had time
to adapt to each other.

00:05:49.142 --> 00:05:50.644
But if we add a new Emerald

00:05:50.744 --> 00:05:52.612
without following
the right steps,

00:05:52.712 --> 00:05:54.681
it could cause
an electromagnetic reaction

00:05:54.781 --> 00:05:57.818
that we can't control,
and we'll be in major trouble!

brought together,

doing in school?

He's a model student,
Mr. Thorndyke.

00:07:52.666 --> 00:07:54.434
Is there a reason we're here?

00:07:54.534 --> 00:07:57.370
Or did we all travel all this
way just to say hello?

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:59.372
You mean I didn't tell you?

00:07:59.472 --> 00:08:01.908

Surprising Mom with that ring

she'll like it, Ella?

00:09:27.761 --> 00:09:29.496
Aah!

00:09:34.234 --> 00:09:35.268
Oh, my!

00:09:35.402 --> 00:09:36.636
It's amazing!

00:09:36.736 --> 00:09:38.204
What's going on?

00:09:38.304 --> 00:09:39.639
[All shout]

00:09:39.739 --> 00:09:41.141
Aah!

00:09:53.086 --> 00:09:55.488
[Snoring]

00:09:55.588 --> 00:09:58.491
I am bored out of my circuits.

00:09:58.591 --> 00:10:02.128
I would give my left servomotor
for a little excitement.

00:10:02.262 --> 00:10:03.963
- [Beep]
- What is this?

00:10:04.097 --> 00:10:05.465
Dr. Eggman!

00:10:05.565 --> 00:10:07.667
We have detected
a Chaos Emerald!

00:10:07.767 --> 00:10:08.968
Aah!

00:10:09.102 --> 00:10:11.738
You'd better not be joking.

00:10:12.238 --> 00:10:14.007
Where?
Show me!

00:10:14.107 --> 00:10:15.008
There.

00:10:15.108 --> 00:10:17.010
In Filmdom City.

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:18.044
Right!

00:10:18.144 --> 00:10:21.114
Set a course for Filmdom City
on the double!

00:10:29.589 --> 00:10:33.026
There's a Chaos Emerald
somewhere around here.

00:10:35.095 --> 00:10:38.531
That Emerald could be anyplace
in this city.

00:10:41.401 --> 00:10:43.536
I found it.

00:10:50.677 --> 00:10:52.245
Whoa!

00:10:54.848 --> 00:10:56.249
[All scream]

00:11:02.555 --> 00:11:04.224
[All gasp]

00:11:06.559 --> 00:11:09.195
Just what is going on here?

00:11:09.329 --> 00:11:11.297
The filming is about to begin.

00:11:11.431 --> 00:11:13.333
You should go get changed, sir.

00:11:13.433 --> 00:11:15.735
Yeah, you're right.

00:11:18.037 --> 00:11:21.908
Thorndyke doesn't know how
valuable that gem really is.

00:11:23.276 --> 00:11:24.444
Now what?

00:11:24.544 --> 00:11:27.747
That ring is made from
a Chaos Emerald, isn't it?

00:11:27.847 --> 00:11:29.649
We need that Emerald
to get home,

00:11:29.749 --> 00:11:31.251
but now it looks like Chris' mom

00:11:31.351 --> 00:11:33.253
will be wearing it
on her finger.

00:11:33.386 --> 00:11:35.054
We should talk about it
with Chris,

00:11:35.188 --> 00:11:39.192
but let's wait till after
the surprise party is over.

00:11:41.828 --> 00:11:43.563
Calling Homeroom.

00:11:43.663 --> 00:11:45.999
I have just detected
a possible Chaos Emerald.

00:11:46.099 --> 00:11:48.134
Will retrieve.

00:11:49.035 --> 00:11:52.772
We need some more foliage
over here.

00:11:52.872 --> 00:11:56.743
I think this is one of the
greatest roles you've ever done.

00:12:03.416 --> 00:12:05.285
Hello, Sonic.

00:12:05.385 --> 00:12:08.121
Hey, there, Knuckles.
What's crackin'?

00:12:08.254 --> 00:12:09.789
You tell me.

00:12:09.889 --> 00:12:13.827
To be honest,
I'm not really sure.

00:12:13.927 --> 00:12:15.862
WOMAN:
Let's try one more take.

00:12:15.962 --> 00:12:18.464
Try to get it right
this time, people!

00:12:18.565 --> 00:12:21.534
Ready?
And action!

00:12:22.335 --> 00:12:24.437
The prince swore
he would return someday,

00:12:24.537 --> 00:12:26.906
and I know he'll keep his word.

00:12:27.006 --> 00:12:28.508
[Gasps]
Oh!

00:12:30.109 --> 00:12:32.712
Is it really you?

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.015
Whoa!

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.052
Oh!

00:12:40.687 --> 00:12:43.089
Oh, no, the ring!

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:45.158
Nelson?

00:12:45.291 --> 00:12:46.659
Lindsey.

00:12:46.759 --> 00:12:49.762
- Aah!
- Aah!

00:13:03.243 --> 00:13:06.145
We are closing in
on the Chaos Emerald.

00:13:06.246 --> 00:13:07.413
Look, Doctor!

00:13:07.513 --> 00:13:08.648
What?

00:13:08.748 --> 00:13:11.651
[Laughs menacingly]

00:13:11.784 --> 00:13:14.721
That light beam will lead us
straight to the Emerald!

00:13:14.821 --> 00:13:16.389
Let's go!

00:13:24.764 --> 00:13:28.167
Put that ring back in the box
right away!

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.908
[All shout]

00:13:35.008 --> 00:13:39.012
I think perhaps we should
move off the set, sir.

00:13:39.112 --> 00:13:41.414
What in the world
has gotten into you?

00:13:41.514 --> 00:13:43.149
We're shooting
the most important scene

00:13:43.249 --> 00:13:44.584
in the entire movie!

00:13:44.684 --> 00:13:46.786
I was only trying
to surprise you, honey.

00:13:46.886 --> 00:13:50.356
This isn't going
like Dad planned at all.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.792
Sorry, I forgot I married
a movie star!

00:13:52.926 --> 00:13:54.460
How would you like it

00:13:54.594 --> 00:13:56.930
if I barged into one of
your shareholder meetings

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.831
and made a complete fool
of myself?

00:13:58.932 --> 00:14:01.401
At least I cared enough
to come visit you!

00:14:01.501 --> 00:14:03.336
What is that supposed to mean?

00:14:03.436 --> 00:14:06.005
Are you insinuating
that I don't care?

00:14:06.105 --> 00:14:07.640
Now, now, calm down.

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.342
- Butt out!
- Butt out!

00:14:09.442 --> 00:14:12.845
Homeroom, will you alert
the crisis team to stand by?

00:14:12.946 --> 00:14:15.448
Sonic, we need that ring.

00:14:15.548 --> 00:14:18.117
I know,
but it won't be easy to get.

00:14:18.217 --> 00:14:21.087
Let's just tell them
we need it to get home.

00:14:21.187 --> 00:14:23.723
We can't spoil
their anniversary.

00:14:23.856 --> 00:14:25.792
[Crashing]

00:14:30.863 --> 00:14:33.833
TOGETHER:
Hand over that Chaos Emerald!

00:14:33.933 --> 00:14:37.270
TOGETHER:
It's Eggman, of course.

00:14:39.839 --> 00:14:41.240
Aah!

00:14:41.908 --> 00:14:44.043
This way, Eggman!

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.549
I'll get you, Sonic!

00:14:58.791 --> 00:14:59.926
Whoa!

00:15:02.362 --> 00:15:03.896
With all this confusion,

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:06.165
now's the perfect time
to make my move!

00:15:06.265 --> 00:15:07.233
Rouge!

00:15:08.501 --> 00:15:10.403
Where's the ring?

00:15:12.238 --> 00:15:12.872
Hey!

00:15:12.972 --> 00:15:14.640
You give that back to me!

00:15:14.741 --> 00:15:17.443
Sorry, but this gem
is really a Chaos Emerald,

00:15:17.543 --> 00:15:19.612
which is far too precious
to use in jewelry,

00:15:19.712 --> 00:15:21.647
even for somebody
as glamorous as me.

00:15:21.748 --> 00:15:23.349
Ha ha!

00:15:23.449 --> 00:15:25.752
Let's make sure
this Emerald is real.

00:15:25.885 --> 00:15:28.287
Fantastic!
We hit the jackpot!

00:15:28.388 --> 00:15:30.456
Hand it back, Eggman!

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:32.625
No way!
It's mine now!

00:15:33.526 --> 00:15:34.994
Give it up!

00:15:35.128 --> 00:15:36.429
Get away!

00:15:36.529 --> 00:15:38.631
Decoe and Bocoe,
come and help me!

00:15:38.731 --> 00:15:40.099
Hurry!

00:15:40.867 --> 00:15:42.335
Oh!
Yes, Doctor!

00:15:42.435 --> 00:15:43.970
Coming!

00:15:46.572 --> 00:15:50.209
Dr. Eggman is trying to escape
with the Emerald!

00:15:53.579 --> 00:15:55.448
Come on, drop it!

00:15:55.548 --> 00:15:58.051
I'd rather drop you!

00:16:05.925 --> 00:16:07.827
Ladies, please!

00:16:07.927 --> 00:16:09.195
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

00:16:10.096 --> 00:16:11.664
Eggman!

00:16:11.764 --> 00:16:15.435
TOGETHER: Hand over that
Chaos Emerald or else!

00:16:15.535 --> 00:16:17.403
Or else what?

00:16:17.503 --> 00:16:20.807
Weazo!
Get rid of those clowns!

00:16:31.651 --> 00:16:34.287
Not another robot!

00:16:44.664 --> 00:16:45.731
You get away!

00:16:45.832 --> 00:16:48.601
Don't you dare harm my family!

00:16:49.202 --> 00:16:51.337
TANAKA:
Hold it, chump.

00:16:55.374 --> 00:16:58.778
Before you lay your claws
on the Thorndyke family,

00:16:58.878 --> 00:17:01.714
you must get past me.

00:17:09.655 --> 00:17:12.391
Well, robot, do you feel lucky?

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:18.764
What's wrong with that guy?

00:17:18.898 --> 00:17:21.934
Too many Kung Fu movies.

00:17:36.816 --> 00:17:39.418
Leave them alone, Weazo.

00:17:39.519 --> 00:17:40.553
Whoa!

00:17:42.788 --> 00:17:45.691
You won't win that easy!

00:17:49.462 --> 00:17:51.464
Come on!

00:17:55.067 --> 00:17:57.003
[Laughs menacingly]

00:17:57.103 --> 00:17:59.438
Soon I'll steal
the other Emeralds, too!

00:17:59.539 --> 00:18:01.240
This one sure is impressive!

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.177
It looks very powerful!

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.061
Huh?

00:18:22.161 --> 00:18:23.863
It's a dead end!

00:18:31.137 --> 00:18:32.838
I can't get away!

00:18:35.107 --> 00:18:38.008
Sonic?

00:18:38.108 --> 00:18:39.243
Hey, Sonic!

00:18:39.343 --> 00:18:41.011
Where are you?

00:18:44.715 --> 00:18:47.117
They're fighting in water?

00:18:54.758 --> 00:18:56.293
Now I see.

00:18:59.396 --> 00:19:00.631
Listen, Sonic!

00:19:00.731 --> 00:19:02.266
Jump up now!

00:19:15.412 --> 00:19:17.047
You're through!

00:19:22.653 --> 00:19:24.788
[All shouting]

00:19:24.922 --> 00:19:27.658
I think I'll cut Sonic a break
and call it quits today.

00:19:27.758 --> 00:19:29.359
- Good idea.
- Good idea.

00:19:29.459 --> 00:19:32.029
TOGETHER:
Thanks for the Chaos Emerald!

00:19:34.932 --> 00:19:36.934
Are you all okay?

00:19:37.034 --> 00:19:38.502
You protected us, dear!

00:19:38.602 --> 00:19:40.837
Of course.
You're my family.

00:19:40.938 --> 00:19:43.907
This surprise party
certainly was surprising.

00:19:44.007 --> 00:19:47.744
I'm all upset that Eggman stole
Mrs. Thorndyke's new ring.

00:19:47.844 --> 00:19:49.846
That gemstone was so pretty.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.382
I have failed in my duties.

00:19:52.482 --> 00:19:54.885
I don't deserve this uniform.

00:19:54.985 --> 00:19:58.121
Hold on! The important thing is
we're all here to celebrate

00:19:58.255 --> 00:20:00.090
Mom and Dad's anniversary!

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:01.491
And besides, Tanaka,

00:20:01.592 --> 00:20:03.894
it isn't your fault
that my ring was stolen.

00:20:03.994 --> 00:20:04.861
Thank you.

00:20:04.962 --> 00:20:05.896
Hey!

00:20:05.996 --> 00:20:09.266
Let's all wish my mom and dad
a very happy anniversary!

00:20:09.366 --> 00:20:11.902
TOGETHER:
And many more!

00:20:12.002 --> 00:20:13.804
Chao!

00:20:13.904 --> 00:20:16.506
TOGETHER:
Thank you, everybody!

00:20:18.275 --> 00:20:20.744
Congratulations!

00:20:25.282 --> 00:20:27.250
It all worked out okay.

00:20:27.351 --> 00:20:29.086
Yeah, except for Eggman
getting away

00:20:29.219 --> 00:20:31.989
with a Chaos Emerald,
it went just perfect.

00:20:32.122 --> 00:20:35.859
Sonic has four Chaos Emeralds,
and Knuckles has one.

00:20:35.959 --> 00:20:38.228
Even Dr. Eggman has one Emerald,

00:20:38.328 --> 00:20:40.831
and now we're the only ones
who don't have any.

00:20:40.931 --> 00:20:42.733
When the last
Chaos Emerald is found

00:20:42.833 --> 00:20:46.837
and all seven are put together,
it'll be a real blast.

00:20:46.937 --> 00:20:49.840
I'll get those Emeralds
no matter what.
