00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.502
Last time on Sonic X,

00:00:01.502 --> 00:00:03.237
a research vessel vanished at sea,

00:00:03.237 --> 00:00:04.938
leading to a maritime mystery.

00:00:04.938 --> 00:00:06.640
While Dr. Eggman's
wrapped-up robots

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.342
sprang a trap to steal a map,

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:11.745
the ancient chart pointed the way to
the legendary continent of Murasia,

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.648
and our heroes set sail for the
last remnant of that lost landĂ˘

00:00:14.648 --> 00:00:16.183
a volcanic island!

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:18.185
When they found themselves
attacked by Dr. Eggman,

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:20.387
government agents
roared to the rescue.

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:21.955
But the devious doc
made his escape,

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:25.025
and he hatched a scary scheme to
liquidate the world with lava!

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:27.895
Can Sonic stop Eggman before
he causes a global eruption?

00:00:27.895 --> 00:00:29.863
Find out next on Sonic X!

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.765
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:34.835

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.771
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.679
Got ourselves a situation

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.714
Stuck in a new location

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:51.318
Without any explanation

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.387
No talk of relaxation

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.022
Don't, don't, don't

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:56.823
Don't blink, don't think

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:58.625
Just go, go, go, go

Sonic is on the run

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.534
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:11.271

so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:38.943 --> 00:01:41.245
If you'd have put up a
fight against Eggman,

00:01:41.245 --> 00:01:43.748
instead of letting him capture
you, we wouldn't be stuck here.

00:01:43.748 --> 00:01:45.016
Yeah! We had Eggman trapped,

00:01:45.016 --> 00:01:46.450
but he had you and
your crew on board,

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.052
so we couldn't destroy his ship.

00:01:48.052 --> 00:01:50.521
Don't act like that
was what stopped you!

00:01:50.922 --> 00:01:52.423
She's upset.

00:01:52.423 --> 00:01:54.792
Why don't you go and comfort her?

00:01:54.792 --> 00:01:56.227
If you insist, sir.

00:01:56.227 --> 00:01:57.695
I will do what I can.

[Huffing]

Those two bullies...!

Hiiiiyah!

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:13.878

[Gasp]

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:18.583
But I know I can fly the X
Tornado down into the crater.

00:02:18.583 --> 00:02:19.951
It's too dangerous!

00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:22.253
It's the only way to
catch up with Eggman.

00:02:22.253 --> 00:02:23.254
I'm in.

00:02:23.254 --> 00:02:24.889
Rouge? What about you?

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:26.824
You willing to come along?

00:02:26.824 --> 00:02:28.759
Doesn't sound like I have a choice.

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:29.727
If I stay behind,

00:02:29.727 --> 00:02:31.996
there won't be anybody on
the team to look after you.

00:02:31.996 --> 00:02:33.998
Ha! Very funny.

00:02:33.998 --> 00:02:35.900
We have found something.

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:39.337
Here, doctor.

00:02:41.973 --> 00:02:43.007
Incredible!

00:02:43.007 --> 00:02:45.910
This box seems to be
made of irmurasium!

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.511
What's irmurasium?

00:02:47.511 --> 00:02:50.715
It's an unusual metal that
was used by the Murasians.

00:02:54.285 --> 00:02:55.720
Hello!

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.623
According to my research,
Murasian cities were filled

00:02:58.623 --> 00:03:01.459
with precious gemstones
even larger than this one.

00:03:02.093 --> 00:03:03.461
Amazing!

00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:06.397
I never knew archaeology
could be so fascinating!

00:03:11.202 --> 00:03:13.604
Doctor! We will hit the lava soon!

00:03:13.604 --> 00:03:14.739
[Evil chuckle]

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.607
I have a plan, don't worry.

00:03:16.607 --> 00:03:18.709
If it is anything
like his past plans,

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.111
we are going to get burned.

00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:22.046
Are you two doubting Dr. Eggman?

00:03:22.046 --> 00:03:23.948
Doctor, Doctor,
they're dissing you!

00:03:23.948 --> 00:03:25.650
You know what I like about him?

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.451
Yes. Nothing.

00:03:27.451 --> 00:03:29.654
Well, I don't like you two either!

00:03:29.654 --> 00:03:32.456
I've located a tunnel that will
take us further underground.

00:03:46.003 --> 00:03:48.005
Let's go check out that volcano!

00:04:14.198 --> 00:04:16.667
They blocked up the tunnel
after they drove through.

00:04:16.667 --> 00:04:18.135
Ya see?

00:04:21.005 --> 00:04:23.107
Hmph. That won't stop me!

00:04:23.774 --> 00:04:24.742
[Grunting]

00:04:29.013 --> 00:04:30.581
If you don't stop that digging,

00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:31.983
you're gonna bury us here!

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.918
Heh, heh. Sorry!

00:04:34.885 --> 00:04:37.488
There's another tunnel here,
but it's pretty narrow.

00:04:37.488 --> 00:04:39.423
Let's see where it goes.

00:04:41.993 --> 00:04:43.461
What about us?

00:04:43.461 --> 00:04:45.896
We can look around
in the X Tornado!

00:04:56.707 --> 00:04:57.675
Oh!

00:04:57.675 --> 00:05:00.077
Careful! You both have big heads.

00:05:00.077 --> 00:05:01.545
Good thing they're hard.

00:05:02.513 --> 00:05:03.881
Ugh.

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:05.883
Oh!

00:05:06.851 --> 00:05:09.353
It's some kind of fluorescent moss.

00:05:09.353 --> 00:05:10.888
How'd ya know that?

00:05:10.888 --> 00:05:11.856
Easy!

00:05:11.856 --> 00:05:13.791
When you're a treasure
hunter like me,

00:05:13.791 --> 00:05:15.726
you've been everywhere, and
you've seen all kinds of biz-

00:05:16.894 --> 00:05:17.862
Huh.

00:05:19.163 --> 00:05:20.364
I see!

00:05:20.364 --> 00:05:21.899

But how?

00:07:36.534 --> 00:07:37.868
As their continent sank,

00:07:37.868 --> 00:07:39.770
they must've fled
to this huge cave,

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:41.672
and used the power of irmurasium

00:07:41.672 --> 00:07:44.808
to make an artificial sun
to provide heat and light.

00:07:44.808 --> 00:07:46.744
Once the Murasians
moved underground,

00:07:46.744 --> 00:07:49.647
some legends say they
encountered terrible creatures

00:07:49.647 --> 00:07:53.484
that destroyed their kingdom and
drove all the survivors away.

00:07:53.484 --> 00:07:56.187
I always thought the stories
about underground kingdoms

00:07:56.187 --> 00:07:57.588
and monsters were myths,

I'm not surprised.

There's a very thin line
between "hate" and "love."

Well, you make it thicker!

to be working fine.

give us an idea of how much

up inside the volcano.

Look! I found something!

00:09:28.412 --> 00:09:29.813
Is it edible?

00:09:30.214 --> 00:09:32.249
It probably tastes like chicken.

00:09:32.249 --> 00:09:34.618
I do not want to find out.

00:09:34.952 --> 00:09:37.921
There! That looks more appetizing!

00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:42.860
I have never seen
such a huge cherry.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.129
Our search has been very fruitful.

00:09:45.129 --> 00:09:46.397
[Chuckling]

00:09:46.397 --> 00:09:47.398
[Grunting]

00:09:47.398 --> 00:09:50.467
Oooh!

00:09:50.467 --> 00:09:51.902
[Chuckling]

00:09:51.902 --> 00:09:53.103
Woah!

00:09:56.206 --> 00:09:58.142
Aaah!!!

00:10:02.012 --> 00:10:03.914
Aaah!!!

00:10:05.983 --> 00:10:07.251
Ah, ah, ah!

00:10:07.251 --> 00:10:08.752
Eggman's robots!

00:10:09.753 --> 00:10:11.588
[All screaming]

00:10:11.588 --> 00:10:14.158
[Robots yelling]

00:10:15.025 --> 00:10:16.260
[Robots yelling]

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.529
Maybe we should do
something to help them.

00:10:18.529 --> 00:10:20.597
This monster is bugging me out!

00:10:20.597 --> 00:10:23.567
Right now I would give anything
for a giant mothball!

00:10:23.567 --> 00:10:25.703
Maybe I can distract that thing.

00:10:25.703 --> 00:10:26.904
[Grunt]

00:10:27.671 --> 00:10:29.306

[All panting]

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:37.247
Look out! Aah!

00:10:37.247 --> 00:10:39.183
Woah!

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.252
[All yelling]

00:10:42.252 --> 00:10:44.188
Hey, Chris!

00:10:45.155 --> 00:10:46.490
Huh.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.392
Where could he be?

00:10:51.916 --> 00:10:59.657
ALL: Woooaah!

00:10:59.657 --> 00:11:00.658
Huh?

00:11:00.658 --> 00:11:02.593
What did you bring
that brat here for?

00:11:02.593 --> 00:11:03.560
[Laughing sheepishly]

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.463
He risked his life to
save us from a giant bug.

00:11:07.097 --> 00:11:08.399
Really!

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:10.234
Well, he isn't going
to save you from me

00:11:10.234 --> 00:11:12.069
when I tear out your power supply.

00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:13.404
Woah!

00:11:13.404 --> 00:11:14.939
Ah!

00:11:14.939 --> 00:11:17.207
The cave is going to collapse!

00:11:20.678 --> 00:11:22.713
I hope everything is
all right in the cave.

00:11:26.417 --> 00:11:28.752
Are Sonic and the
others gonna be okay?

00:11:29.153 --> 00:11:31.655
That was just a tremor, so
they should all be fine.

00:11:32.156 --> 00:11:34.558
But the pressure inside
the volcano is building.

00:11:34.558 --> 00:11:36.493
Your friends are going
to be in real danger

00:11:36.493 --> 00:11:38.429
if they stay down
there much longer.

00:11:39.596 --> 00:11:42.166
How bad are things
going to get, doctor?

00:11:42.166 --> 00:11:45.035
The data suggest the
volcano is about to erupt.

00:11:47.738 --> 00:11:49.940
If you're still down there
when the volcano blows,

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.442
you'll be in great danger.

00:11:51.442 --> 00:11:52.576
Forget about Eggman!

00:11:52.576 --> 00:11:55.479
Just pack up your gear and head
for the surface right away!

00:11:56.814 --> 00:11:58.282
Okay, doc!

00:11:58.282 --> 00:11:59.917
What do we do?

00:11:59.917 --> 00:12:01.852
We don't have any time to lose.

00:12:02.853 --> 00:12:04.655
I gotta find Chris, fast!

00:12:04.655 --> 00:12:06.457
We should come up
with a plan first!

00:12:06.457 --> 00:12:08.525
The best thing for
me to do is wing it!

00:12:08.525 --> 00:12:09.760
[Gasp]

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.628
Where do you think you're going?!

00:12:12.262 --> 00:12:14.431
I'll search for Chris from the sky.

00:12:14.431 --> 00:12:17.768
You and Tails can set up the equipment
and look for that hot spot.

00:12:17.768 --> 00:12:20.237
Make sure you find it
before Eggman blows it up.

00:12:20.237 --> 00:12:23.140
All right, but be careful, Rouge!

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:24.241
Good luck.

00:12:24.241 --> 00:12:26.176
I'll see ya soon, handsome.

00:12:29.213 --> 00:12:32.716
For such a small fry, you
certainly are a big sap.

00:12:32.716 --> 00:12:34.385
You risked your neck
to save these clowns,

00:12:34.385 --> 00:12:35.819
and now you're my prisoner!

00:12:35.819 --> 00:12:37.755
How hilariously humiliating!

00:12:37.755 --> 00:12:39.757
[Evil laugh]

00:12:39.757 --> 00:12:41.792
I'm glad I tried to help them.

00:12:41.792 --> 00:12:44.228
Uh! Uh! Uh!

00:12:44.228 --> 00:12:45.729
Woah!

00:12:55.773 --> 00:12:58.175
My analysis is finally finished,

00:12:58.175 --> 00:13:01.278
and it shows the hot spot is
only a few hundred yards away.

00:13:01.278 --> 00:13:02.780
[Robots tremble]

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.149
Quit loafing and let's get moving!

00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:19.797
Huh?

00:13:21.698 --> 00:13:22.833
Ah!

00:13:27.271 --> 00:13:28.772
Oh, my!

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:33.777
Ah.

00:13:47.091 --> 00:13:48.992
[Evil chuckle]

00:13:48.992 --> 00:13:50.627
Do you have the detonator?

00:13:50.627 --> 00:13:51.161
Yes.

00:13:51.161 --> 00:13:52.563
Watch closely, kid.

00:13:52.563 --> 00:13:54.865
You'll see why I'm called
a master of mayhem.

00:13:54.865 --> 00:13:56.433
By setting off a
blast in this spot,

00:13:56.433 --> 00:13:58.635
I'll cause a chain reaction!

00:13:58.635 --> 00:14:01.105
This whole planet's
gonna blow it's top!

00:14:01.105 --> 00:14:03.307
Every volcano in the
world will erupt,

00:14:03.307 --> 00:14:04.975
leading to worldwide chaos!

00:14:04.975 --> 00:14:06.510
On top of the ashes
of the old world,

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:09.113
I can build my Eggman Empire!

00:14:09.113 --> 00:14:11.048
[Evil laughter]

00:14:11.048 --> 00:14:12.983
Sonic'll stop you in time.

00:14:12.983 --> 00:14:14.151
He'd better hurry,

00:14:14.151 --> 00:14:16.553
because I'm gonna hit the
detonator switch right now!

00:14:16.553 --> 00:14:17.855
Here.

00:14:17.855 --> 00:14:19.056
You can't set that off!

00:14:19.056 --> 00:14:20.424
Just watch me!

00:14:20.424 --> 00:14:22.159
Aaah!

00:14:22.159 --> 00:14:24.094
Sorry about that, Chris.

00:14:24.094 --> 00:14:26.029
Dr. Eggman, that was mean.

00:14:26.029 --> 00:14:28.665
That klutzy kid gave
himself the slip.

00:14:32.236 --> 00:14:34.438
This dinosaur rocks!

00:14:34.438 --> 00:14:37.341
Woah! Woah! Not another quake!

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:40.577

to avoid the crush!

We are stranded.

The heat's on, now.

00:16:07.998 --> 00:16:09.032
What do you mean?

00:16:09.032 --> 00:16:11.301
This whole cave's gonna
fill up with lava.

00:16:11.301 --> 00:16:11.935
Huh?

00:16:11.935 --> 00:16:13.437

It is no use.

A bomb is about to cause all the
volcanoes on the planet to erupt.

Wait, kid!

00:17:00.751 --> 00:17:02.019
We will help you!

00:17:02.019 --> 00:17:03.553
But what can you do?

00:17:03.553 --> 00:17:05.522
Outside we look like servants...

00:17:05.522 --> 00:17:08.058
But inside we are built for battle!

00:17:08.058 --> 00:17:10.494
All we have to do is
put our heads together.

00:17:10.494 --> 00:17:13.063
And the result is electrifying!

00:17:13.063 --> 00:17:15.098
What? What are you talking about?

00:17:15.098 --> 00:17:16.700
First, we link up.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:20.103
Then our internal circuits
undergoes a total integration.

00:17:20.103 --> 00:17:23.006
Then our transformation
software is activated.

00:17:23.006 --> 00:17:25.375
Which takes us into
power armor mode!

00:17:25.375 --> 00:17:27.711
Which creates a mighty
mechanical giant!

00:19:24.696 --> 00:19:27.298
Come on! We gotta go!

00:19:31.803 --> 00:19:33.738
Murasian culture seems more

00:19:33.738 --> 00:19:35.640
mysterious than ever to me now.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.775
I only wish we'd had more time.

00:19:42.347 --> 00:19:44.382
Their achievements were astounding,

00:19:44.382 --> 00:19:46.184
but perhaps they went too far.

00:19:46.184 --> 00:19:48.820
Did their quest for greatness
lead to their destruction?

00:19:49.153 --> 00:19:51.055
We may never know for sure.

00:19:51.055 --> 00:19:53.524
Today, I almost got
crushed in a cave,

00:19:53.524 --> 00:19:54.926
mangled by a monster,

00:19:54.926 --> 00:19:56.227
and cooked by a volcano.

00:19:56.227 --> 00:19:58.830
But findin' this baby
made it all worthwhile.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.098
Oh!

00:20:00.098 --> 00:20:04.602
Another artifact from the
underground kingdom of Murasia!

00:20:04.602 --> 00:20:06.537
Thank you, Rouge.

00:20:06.537 --> 00:20:09.407
Feel free to stop by the
museum anytime and see it.

00:20:09.407 --> 00:20:10.808
Yeah... Sure, doc.

00:20:10.808 --> 00:20:14.145
Decoe and Bocoe sacrificed
themselves to help me.

00:20:14.145 --> 00:20:16.814
Yeah. Guess they weren't
so bad after all.

00:20:16.814 --> 00:20:19.484
They proved themselves
to be heroes.

00:20:19.484 --> 00:20:21.819
I'm gonna miss having
those two as enemies.

00:20:21.819 --> 00:20:22.787
Huh?

00:20:27.158 --> 00:20:29.861
You have warmed our
cold metallic hearts.

00:20:29.861 --> 00:20:30.828
ALL: Huh?

00:20:30.828 --> 00:20:32.764
Luckily, we pulled
ourselves together

00:20:32.764 --> 00:20:34.699
just in time to escape the volcano.

00:20:35.867 --> 00:20:37.802
[Both giggling]

00:20:37.802 --> 00:20:39.871
You really are incredible.

00:20:39.871 --> 00:20:41.706
Two resourceful robots like these

00:20:41.706 --> 00:20:43.708
could come in very handy some day.

00:20:43.708 --> 00:20:45.643
If they'd like to join our team.

00:20:45.643 --> 00:20:47.178
Oh, you bet we would!

00:20:47.178 --> 00:20:49.547
Dr. Eggman always
works us overtime!

00:20:49.547 --> 00:20:51.816
We would like to work him over!

00:20:54.852 --> 00:20:57.755
We slaved away for
Eggman long enough.

00:20:57.755 --> 00:21:00.425
Now we will take charge
of our own future!

00:21:00.425 --> 00:21:02.794
Eggman, we quit!
