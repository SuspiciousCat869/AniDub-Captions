WEBVTT

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:09.176
[Laughter]

00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:10.544
Just a few minutes to go!

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:12.779
This is the perfect way
to start the new year!

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.582
Yeah! Much better than
celebrating at midnight!

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:18.185
Celebrating the first
sunrise of the new year.

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:20.087
Great idea, Mr. Tanaka!

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:21.154
Thank you.

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:22.656
Get ready, guys!

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:24.224
As soon as the sun comes up,

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:26.260
we use our noise-makers!

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.827
Huh?

00:00:26.827 --> 00:00:27.594
[Laughing]

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:29.263
Yeah, haha!

00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:30.397
Hold on, Chris!

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:32.733
I think we should just
wave to the sun instead,

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.067
because if we make too much noise,

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:36.003
we might scare the sun away!

00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:36.970
Chao!

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:40.340
The sun isn't gonna get
scared away, Cream.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:43.243
Don't you worry one bit, dear!

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:46.146
The sun will be happy to
get such a nice welcome!

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.881
Okay, then.

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.283
I'll take one!

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:53.687
Sonic needs one, too!

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:55.188
Huh?

00:00:56.323 --> 00:00:58.325
Try that way!

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.641
Go, go, go, go, go

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:17.744
Gotta go fast

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:20.681
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.486
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:28.555
Got ourselves a situation

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:30.591
Stuck in a new location

00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:34.194
Without any explanation

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:36.263
No talk of relaxation

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:37.898
Don't, don't, don't

00:01:37.898 --> 00:01:39.700
Don't blink, don't think

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.468
Just go, go, go, go

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:42.970
Go, go

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:48.542
Sonic is on the run

00:01:48.542 --> 00:01:50.444
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:54.147
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:57.851
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:00.253
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:02.155
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:04.658
Sonic X

00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:06.593
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:09.396
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:10.430
Sonic X

00:02:20.761 --> 00:02:23.330
I'm about to catch the first
rays of the new year, Rouge.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.967
Yuck. When I go on vacation,
I'll pick somewhere nice.

00:02:26.967 --> 00:02:28.168
Like a dark cave.

00:02:28.168 --> 00:02:30.838
That doesn't sound
very appealing to me!

00:02:30.838 --> 00:02:31.805
I'm a bat.

00:02:31.805 --> 00:02:35.075
For me, a cave's the perfect
place to hang out and chill.

00:02:35.075 --> 00:02:37.978
Well, hanging out in a hole
is just plain depressing.

00:02:37.978 --> 00:02:40.914
Now I see why your
social life's so dull.

00:02:40.914 --> 00:02:42.082
Hmph.

00:02:45.586 --> 00:02:48.222
Okay! Let's get ready!

00:02:48.222 --> 00:02:50.758
We will pull the
strings altogether.

00:02:50.758 --> 00:02:54.194
I will give you a signal as soon
as the sun comes over the horizon.

00:02:54.194 --> 00:02:56.230
A few seconds more!

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.400
The sky is getting
lighter... lighter!

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.367
[All gasping]

00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:01.835
It's almost here!

00:03:01.835 --> 00:03:02.903
Get ready...

00:03:02.903 --> 00:03:04.238
Go!

00:03:04.238 --> 00:03:06.473
[Cheering and Celebration]

00:03:19.386 --> 00:03:20.354
Ah!

00:03:20.354 --> 00:03:21.321
Huh?

00:03:21.722 --> 00:03:22.690
No way!

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.957
What's that?

00:03:24.425 --> 00:03:25.592
Woah!

00:03:25.592 --> 00:03:26.727
What's going on?

00:03:27.194 --> 00:03:28.295
[Grunt]

00:03:29.663 --> 00:03:31.365
That doesn't look like the sun...

00:03:31.365 --> 00:03:32.933
Chao chao chao chao!

00:03:32.933 --> 00:03:34.435
Woah!

00:03:34.435 --> 00:03:36.637
It looks like a solar eclipse!

00:03:36.637 --> 00:03:37.871
[All gasp]

00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:39.039
Something's wrong!

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:40.708
There isn't supposed
to be an eclipse!

00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:42.276
That's the Egg Moon, sir!

00:03:42.276 --> 00:03:44.244
Contact the president immediately!

00:03:44.244 --> 00:03:45.446
Right!

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:50.984
It's the Egg Moon?

00:03:50.984 --> 00:03:51.952
Yes, sir.

00:03:51.952 --> 00:03:54.421
Dr. Eggman changed its orbit.

00:03:54.421 --> 00:03:56.957
He's created an artifical eclipse.

00:03:56.957 --> 00:03:59.860
I want to speak to that
lunatic immediately!

00:04:00.627 --> 00:04:01.795
Huh?

00:04:01.795 --> 00:04:04.198
Have no fear, Eggman's here!

00:04:04.932 --> 00:04:06.700
How did you pass security?

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.635
I pretended I was a bar of soap,

00:04:08.635 --> 00:04:10.204
and gave them all the slip.

00:04:10.204 --> 00:04:12.172
This is a Code Red alert!

00:04:12.706 --> 00:04:13.507
Freeze!

00:04:13.507 --> 00:04:14.675
Now hold on!

00:04:14.675 --> 00:04:16.744
I came here peacefully!

00:04:16.744 --> 00:04:17.678
Wait, men.

00:04:17.678 --> 00:04:19.747
Let's hear what he has to say.

00:04:19.747 --> 00:04:20.447
[Gasping]

00:04:20.447 --> 00:04:22.549
Mr. President, please, believe me!

00:04:22.549 --> 00:04:24.818
I didn't move the
Egg Moon on purpose.

00:04:24.818 --> 00:04:27.187
You mean you moved it accidentally.

00:04:27.187 --> 00:04:30.991
A solar storm affected the
Egg Moon's control system.

00:04:30.991 --> 00:04:33.894
The Egg Moon went into
a new orbit by mistake!

00:04:33.894 --> 00:04:37.965
I give you my solemn word that
this eclipse wasn't caused by me!

00:04:38.665 --> 00:04:40.067
I don't believe you.

00:04:40.067 --> 00:04:42.703
Please, sir. I beg
you to believe me!

00:04:43.337 --> 00:04:46.573
For I have a plan to make
the sunshine return!

00:04:48.175 --> 00:04:51.245
Well, we do need light desperately.

00:04:51.245 --> 00:04:53.781
And I'm the man to deliver it, sir!

00:04:53.781 --> 00:04:55.716
If I don't, lock me away!

00:04:55.716 --> 00:04:57.484
What should we do, sir?

00:05:00.487 --> 00:05:01.455
[Sheepish chuckle]

00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:06.627
All right. I'll give
you one chance.

00:05:06.627 --> 00:05:07.594
Heh!

00:05:07.594 --> 00:05:09.530
You won't regret
this, Mr. President.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.432
My sunshine plan will
leave you <i>beaming</i>!

00:05:13.267 --> 00:05:19.673
[Cameras flash, crowds clap]

00:05:19.673 --> 00:05:21.008
[Chuckling]

00:05:21.008 --> 00:05:24.144
[Crowd applauding]

00:05:24.144 --> 00:05:27.881
Ugh. My vacation's been
totally ruined now.

00:05:27.881 --> 00:05:29.616
It's a good thing you're a hothead.

00:05:29.616 --> 00:05:31.418
You don't need the
sun to keep you warm.

00:05:31.418 --> 00:05:32.352
Hmph.

00:05:32.352 --> 00:05:36.089
What could be better for a bat than
a planet that's dark everyday?

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:38.025
This'll do wonders
for my nightlife.

00:05:38.025 --> 00:05:40.727
Girlfriend, I'm flying high!

00:05:40.727 --> 00:05:42.362
[Crying]

00:05:42.362 --> 00:05:45.699
Chao chao!

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.602
I told you we shouldn't
make all that noise!

00:05:48.602 --> 00:05:50.070
The sun did get scared,

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.505
and now it's hiding!

00:05:51.505 --> 00:05:52.773
Chao chao chao chao!

00:05:52.773 --> 00:05:54.641
Please don't cry, Cream, dear.

00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:56.777
I'm sure the sun
will come back soon!

00:05:56.777 --> 00:05:59.513
This eclipse surely
won't last for long.

00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:08.455
Hm...

00:06:12.492 --> 00:06:14.428
We want some answers!

00:06:14.428 --> 00:06:16.897
How long will it take you to
correct the Egg Moon's orbit

00:06:16.897 --> 00:06:18.232
and end the eclipse?

00:06:18.232 --> 00:06:19.933
I have bad news for you.

00:06:19.933 --> 00:06:22.836
The damage to the Egg Moon
will be difficult to repair.

00:06:22.836 --> 00:06:26.006
For the moment, it will be
impossible to move the Egg Moon.

00:06:26.006 --> 00:06:29.376
Are you telling us this eclipse
will continue indefinitely?

00:06:29.376 --> 00:06:32.045
I'm sure I'll come up with
a solution eventually.

00:06:32.045 --> 00:06:33.881
But I'm afraid it's
going to take time.

00:06:33.881 --> 00:06:36.583
I'll have to write new
software and run tests.

00:06:36.583 --> 00:06:38.385
Were I to act in haste,

00:06:38.385 --> 00:06:41.154
the consequences could
be catastrophic.

00:06:41.154 --> 00:06:43.857
But without sunshine,
the planet will freeze!

00:06:43.857 --> 00:06:45.792
I won't let it freeze!

00:06:45.792 --> 00:06:48.228
I can provide you with
plenty of heat, and light,

00:06:48.228 --> 00:06:51.098
because I've invented an
artificial form of sunshine!

00:06:51.098 --> 00:06:53.100
Artificial sunshine?

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.835
Just you wait and see.

00:06:54.835 --> 00:06:57.504
This is my brightest idea ever.

00:06:57.504 --> 00:06:58.872
[Chuckling]

00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:04.278
All systems are go.

00:07:04.278 --> 00:07:05.012
Roger!

00:07:05.012 --> 00:07:06.380
We're all set for launch.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.948
Prepare for countdown.

00:07:07.948 --> 00:07:10.250
Hold it! You can't start yet!

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:12.386
This'd better be important, Bokkun.

00:07:12.386 --> 00:07:14.087
I've got a message for ya!

00:07:14.087 --> 00:07:17.190
Dr. Eggman has something
personal to say!

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.593
I have faith in you two.

00:07:19.593 --> 00:07:20.560
Thank you!

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.863
Why would he have faith in you two?

00:07:22.863 --> 00:07:24.598
You mess up every time!

00:07:24.598 --> 00:07:26.400
But mess up this time,

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.468
and I'll dismantle both
of you with my bare hands,

00:07:28.468 --> 00:07:30.404
and sell you piece by
piece on the Internet!

00:07:31.571 --> 00:07:34.107
He certainly has a unique
management style.

00:07:34.107 --> 00:07:37.377
Yes. If his workers
fail, he destroys them.

00:07:37.377 --> 00:07:40.314
Do you really think
he'd get rid of us?

00:07:40.314 --> 00:07:41.949
Only if he felt like it.

00:07:41.949 --> 00:07:43.216
We will not fail!

00:07:43.216 --> 00:07:45.352
Is there actually a possibility?

00:07:45.352 --> 00:07:46.753
Attention, launch crew!

00:07:46.753 --> 00:07:48.789
Proceed with countdown!

00:07:49.323 --> 00:07:50.357

00:07:50.357 --> 00:07:51.358

00:07:51.358 --> 00:07:52.392

00:07:52.392 --> 00:07:53.293

00:07:55.228 --> 00:07:56.196
Liftoff!

00:08:53.787 --> 00:08:56.990
The system's power storage is
now at 10% of full capacity,

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:58.525
and rising steadily!

00:09:16.576 --> 00:09:17.978
For several days now,

00:09:17.978 --> 00:09:21.815
the endless eclipse has blocked all
sunlight from reaching our planet.

We have to do something!

00:17:56.114 --> 00:17:58.850
Do you want me to
inform the media, sir?

00:17:59.818 --> 00:18:02.721
Yes. Give them the tape.

00:18:05.223 --> 00:18:09.094
There's been a late breaking
development in the mirror tower case.

00:18:09.094 --> 00:18:11.596
A videotape just released
by the government

00:18:11.596 --> 00:18:16.401
shows the towers being destroyed
by Sonic the Hedgehog!

00:18:25.407 --> 00:18:27.075
What? No way!

00:18:27.075 --> 00:18:28.977
Sonic doesn't do things like that!

00:18:28.977 --> 00:18:30.612
It has to be a mistake!

00:18:30.612 --> 00:18:32.781
Yeah, I betcha that video's a fake.

00:18:33.548 --> 00:18:36.518
An unruly mob is gathering
outside the mansion.

00:18:36.518 --> 00:18:38.119
Wonderful.

00:18:38.119 --> 00:18:41.089
We want Sonic!

00:18:41.089 --> 00:18:43.792
We want Sonic! We want Sonic!

00:18:43.792 --> 00:18:45.327
What'll we do?

00:18:45.327 --> 00:18:47.929
It sounds like they're
really angry with Sonic.

00:18:47.929 --> 00:18:50.565
What made Sonic do
something so crazy?

00:18:50.565 --> 00:18:54.069
Sonic got pretty upset
when he saw Eggman on TV.

00:18:54.069 --> 00:18:56.004
So you think he did it just because

00:18:56.004 --> 00:18:58.273
he didn't want Dr.
Eggman to be a hero?

00:18:58.273 --> 00:18:59.874
That's an awful thing to say!

00:18:59.874 --> 00:19:02.410
But what other explanation
could there be?

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:04.412
I'm sure he had a good reason.

00:19:04.412 --> 00:19:06.915
Then why didn't he tell anybody?

00:19:06.915 --> 00:19:08.416
They're breaking through!

00:19:08.416 --> 00:19:10.151
[Commotion]

00:19:10.151 --> 00:19:12.654
Don't worry! Nobody's
gonna get past me!

00:19:12.654 --> 00:19:13.488
Come back!

00:19:13.488 --> 00:19:15.357
You're only going to
make the situation worse

00:19:15.357 --> 00:19:16.658
if they see you're attacking!

00:19:17.659 --> 00:19:19.194
What else can we do?

00:19:19.194 --> 00:19:21.663
Let me try to resolve
this peacefully!

00:19:23.098 --> 00:19:24.666
Grandpa!

00:19:24.666 --> 00:19:28.570
[Yelling]

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.572
[Angry mob]

00:19:30.572 --> 00:19:31.573
Woah!

00:19:31.573 --> 00:19:33.108
Can't we talk about this?

00:19:33.108 --> 00:19:35.543
Leave them alone,
or you will face me!

00:19:36.077 --> 00:19:37.479
Woah!

00:19:37.479 --> 00:19:38.546
[Angry commotion continues]

00:19:38.546 --> 00:19:40.782
Calm down, everybody!

00:19:46.788 --> 00:19:48.723
Sonic is charging the tower!

00:19:48.723 --> 00:19:50.525
What are we supposed to do?

00:19:50.525 --> 00:19:52.227
Pull him over for speeding?

00:19:52.227 --> 00:19:53.962
Do whatever it takes to stop him.

00:19:53.962 --> 00:19:54.963
But how?

00:19:54.963 --> 00:19:57.065
Sonic is too fast for us!

00:20:00.168 --> 00:20:01.136
- Aah!

00:20:13.181 --> 00:20:16.451
Uh... my kids all look up to Sonic.

00:20:16.451 --> 00:20:17.986
How in the world am I
gonna explain to them

00:20:17.986 --> 00:20:20.321
that he's become a bad guy now?

00:20:22.791 --> 00:20:25.694
Sonic's finally showing
his true colors.

00:20:26.795 --> 00:20:29.431
Doctor? Now that you're the hero,

00:20:29.431 --> 00:20:30.865
it's time to make a change.

00:20:30.865 --> 00:20:32.801
[Sinister chuckle]

00:20:33.735 --> 00:20:34.703
Ta-dah!

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:39.874
I love it!

00:20:39.874 --> 00:20:42.077
Join us next time on Eggman X

00:20:42.077 --> 00:20:44.279
when the universe's
greatest super-genius

00:20:44.279 --> 00:20:46.948
finally puts the brakes on
that spineless speedster,

00:20:46.948 --> 00:20:48.550
Sonic the Scuzzbag.

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:52.420
Ooh hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!
