00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:01.902
Last time on Sonic X,

00:00:01.902 --> 00:00:04.571
the Chaos creature devoured
the seventh Chaos Emerald,

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:06.607
and transformed into a mammoth monster!

00:00:06.607 --> 00:00:09.176
A tidal wave of fear flooded Station Square

00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:11.278
as the city became a watery wreck.

00:00:11.278 --> 00:00:14.147
A horde of helicopters couldn't
topple the towering terror,

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:17.618
and even Eggman was sent scrambling
by the belligerent behemoth.

00:00:17.618 --> 00:00:18.785
But with the help of his friends,

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:20.621
and the power of the Chaos Emeralds,

00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:22.556
Super Sonic socked it to him!

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:25.792
Will Station Square recover
from the disastrous deluge?

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:27.427
Or is the city all washed up?

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:29.830
Find out next on Sonic X!

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.765
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:34.835
Gotta go fast

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.771
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:43.610
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.646
Got ourselves a situation

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:47.714
Stuck in a new location

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:51.318
Without any explanation

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.387
No talk of relaxation

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.022
Don't, don't, don't

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:56.823
Don't blink, don't think

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:58.625
Just go, go, go, go

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.127
Go, go

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:05.666
Sonic is on the run

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.534
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:11.271
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:14.942

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:23.684
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.520
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

Sonic X

[Grunt]

00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:46.206
Okay!

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:50.143
[Child crying]
SONIC: Huh?

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:51.244
Hey!

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:52.913
Huh. Huh.

00:01:52.913 --> 00:01:55.349
[Hi-pitched crying]

00:01:56.183 --> 00:01:57.884
[Crying continues]

00:01:57.884 --> 00:01:59.186
In there!

00:01:59.186 --> 00:02:00.187
Hey, toss this!

00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:02.155
Okay, that's good, right here.

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:08.996
Oh, dear. All my lovely furniture ruined.

00:02:08.996 --> 00:02:13.867
[Helicopter]

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:15.402
Okay, class.

00:02:15.402 --> 00:02:18.305
Ready to carry the rescue
supplies to the cafeteria?

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:20.440
ALL: Yeah!

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.274
Chris!

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:22.976
Dad! What are you doing here?

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:25.879
I thought I'd drop in and
see how you were doing.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:27.848
I'm fine!

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:29.783
[Grunting]

00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:31.184
At least we survived.

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:34.154
I can't believe it's all gone now.

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:36.089
[Sigh]

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:37.791
These boxes are heavy!

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:40.694
Whew! I need to take a break.

00:02:40.694 --> 00:02:41.662
That's okay.

00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:44.564
Why don't you go play and let me
and Chris finish the unloading?

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:46.500
I can lift as much as you!

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.001
MAN: Our son is lost.
KIDS: Huh?

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.671
Did the search parties find a little boy?

00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:51.872
Uh, no, ma'am.

00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:54.474
[Crying]

00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:57.577
Huh!

00:02:57.577 --> 00:02:58.979
This your kid?

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:00.147
Ma!

00:03:00.147 --> 00:03:01.682
Jim! You're safe!

00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:04.584
Sonic, thanks a lot!

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:06.086
You're wonderful.

00:03:06.086 --> 00:03:07.654
[Chuckles]

00:03:07.654 --> 00:03:08.889
[Giggling]

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.691
When I ran for this job,

00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:13.427
I thought I'd be tackling the
world's problems head on.

00:03:13.427 --> 00:03:16.697
Instead, I'm the most powerful
paper pusher in the world.

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:23.637
I wish just once I could do
something heroic, like Sonic.

00:03:23.637 --> 00:03:27.074
Here's the bill declaring Station
Square to be a disaster area.

00:03:28.175 --> 00:03:31.478
Oh, well. I suppose somebody
has to sign this stuff.

00:03:31.478 --> 00:03:35.082
And this is Executive Order 1137-8.

00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:37.584
You'll have to refresh my memory.

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:38.985
[Sigh]

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:40.887
A new series of robots will be built,

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:43.623
which are specially designed
to combat Dr. Eggman.

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:45.559
Eh... good idea!

00:03:46.927 --> 00:03:48.628
Am I done now?

00:03:48.628 --> 00:03:50.130
One last thing.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.631
What's this?

00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:53.033
A security clearance.

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:56.069
We just hired your new
driver and he starts today.

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.004
He's called Sam Speed.

00:03:58.004 --> 00:03:59.906
Apparently he lives up to his name.

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:04.444
I'll miss you, darling!

00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:06.012
Me too, Mom.

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:07.948
This is it.

00:04:07.948 --> 00:04:08.915
Goodbye!

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:10.150
[Crying]

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.017
Chao!

00:04:11.017 --> 00:04:12.986
What's the big deal?

00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:16.523
Yeah! I promise you'll all be seeing
each other in a month or two.

00:04:16.523 --> 00:04:19.426
Just as soon as we get everything
cleaned up at the house.

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:21.795
Don't forget to send me
a postcard. [Chuckles]

00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:23.163
Me too, Chris. K?

00:04:23.163 --> 00:04:24.231
I will.

00:04:24.231 --> 00:04:25.866
I wish you could stay, Chris.

00:04:25.866 --> 00:04:29.269
Things won't be the same here
without you or Mr. Stewart around.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:30.237
Huh.

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:38.311
Just when I was hitting it off with my class.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:44.217
Isn't Sonic gonna come say goodbye?

00:04:44.217 --> 00:04:46.186
Sonic had to run.

00:04:46.186 --> 00:04:49.956
But he did tell me to say that
he'd see ya later, Chris.

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:50.924
Oh.

00:04:51.658 --> 00:04:53.560
Don't you worry, Chris.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.795
When you're feeling lonely,

00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:58.665
just call us, and we'll all hop in
the X Tornado and fly over to see ya!

00:04:58.665 --> 00:05:02.068
And Sonic can run there for
a visit in no time at all!

00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:03.804
I'll still miss you guys.

00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:05.105
Don't worry!

00:05:05.105 --> 00:05:06.807
Two months isn't all that long.

00:05:06.807 --> 00:05:08.241
And time passes a lot quicker

00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:10.177
when you first move to a new place.

00:05:10.177 --> 00:05:12.179
I guess so.

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:15.182
ALL: Bye, Chris!

00:05:15.182 --> 00:05:17.684
Bye, guys! See ya!

00:05:18.118 --> 00:05:19.319
[Sigh]

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:20.954
Huh?

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:34.234
With these robots,

00:05:34.234 --> 00:05:36.937
we can defeat Dr. Eggman once and for all.

00:05:36.937 --> 00:05:40.807
Yes. Our designs are technically
superior to his in every way.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.046
That's an impossibility.

00:05:46.046 --> 00:05:49.916
If their robots would better, that
would make them smarter than me!

00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:52.619
It does look like they made progress, Doctor.

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:53.854
If it is true,

00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:55.488
we will be in big trouble!

00:05:55.488 --> 00:05:57.090
Then I'll find out.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.593
All I have to do is hack
into their main computer!

00:05:59.593 --> 00:06:03.463
And I'll have instant access
to all of their robot designs.

00:06:06.266 --> 00:06:10.103
[Beeping]

00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:11.605
I'm logged in.

00:06:12.973 --> 00:06:14.107
Great!

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:16.042
We're in.

00:06:18.078 --> 00:06:21.314
How did they come up with all
of these designs so quickly?

00:06:21.314 --> 00:06:23.283
[Grunting in surprise]

00:06:23.283 --> 00:06:24.818
It can't be!

00:06:29.956 --> 00:06:30.924
Oh?

00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:32.859
Dr. Eggman?

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:33.960
Is something wrong?

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.896
Unbelievable!

00:06:36.196 --> 00:06:37.898
This can only mean...

00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:42.535
This world is the world that I was born in!

00:06:42.535 --> 00:06:43.503
Oh!

00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:45.805
This is Professor Gerald Robotnik

00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:48.375
who is the greatest scientific
genius of his time.

00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:50.710
He's my grandfather.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.245
Does that mean there is a connection

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:54.948
between this world and the one we came from?

00:06:54.948 --> 00:06:56.383
But how could that be?

00:06:56.383 --> 00:06:58.385
The two worlds are in parallel universes

00:06:58.385 --> 00:07:01.388
and share the exact same
position in time and space.

00:07:01.388 --> 00:07:04.524
Each is unaware of the other's existence.

00:07:04.524 --> 00:07:07.694
But thanks to Chaos Control,
we traveled between them!

00:07:07.694 --> 00:07:10.130
Let's see if there's any
data about my grandfather

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.465
that can clear up this mystery.

00:07:12.465 --> 00:07:13.867
Let's try Eggman.

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:15.802
Error?!

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.438

[Frustrated yell]

00:07:22.042 --> 00:07:24.144
No way!!!

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.416
Maria!

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:32.585
Heh... yes!

00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:35.989
Ma-ri-a. Come on!

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.158
You did it!

[Alarms sound]

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.761
Huh?

00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:43.396
It's a hacker!

00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:46.466
He used an unknown password to
get into one of our databases!

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:49.469
It holds a top secret file that
nobody's looked at for years!

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:50.403
What?!

00:07:50.403 --> 00:07:51.905
Cut off his access!

00:07:51.905 --> 00:07:53.907

I'll try.

Whew! Hacking sure is hard work!

Now, let's look at that file.

00:08:21.468 --> 00:08:22.435
Huh?

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:26.239
This is... my grandfather's diary!

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:27.607
I've done it!

00:08:27.607 --> 00:08:30.110
My greatest design is now complete!

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.478
The ultimate creature!

00:08:31.478 --> 00:08:32.712
Shadow..!

00:08:32.712 --> 00:08:34.881
My enemies think they have defeated me!

00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:38.084
But Shadow will carry out
my orders without question.

00:08:38.084 --> 00:08:41.521
Now it sleeps, but one day
it will be reawakened!

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:45.058
Shadow will bring total destruction!

00:08:45.058 --> 00:08:48.928
[Evil laugh] I'll awaken
Shadow for you, Grandfather!

00:08:48.928 --> 00:08:50.630
I need your help, Rouge.

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:54.467
Now, I don't know much about Project
Shadow other than the name.

00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:55.735
There was a file,

00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:58.104
but it was impossible
for us to read the data.

00:08:58.104 --> 00:08:59.739
And why's that?

00:08:59.739 --> 00:09:01.474
It was password protected.

00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:02.642
Unfortunately,

00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:06.513
the file was created by the same
scientist who developed Project Shadow

00:09:06.513 --> 00:09:08.314
and he never told anyone the password.

00:09:08.314 --> 00:09:10.150
That was 50 years ago.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.786
But, somebody <i>did</i>
figure out the password

00:09:12.786 --> 00:09:14.888
and stole the file from the laboratory.

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:17.791
Not only did they download
the file from our system,

00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:18.758
but when that was finished,

00:09:18.758 --> 00:09:22.195
they went ahead and deleted the
original file from our computer.

00:09:22.195 --> 00:09:24.898
That sounds just like
something Eggman would do.

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:26.833
It <i>was</i> him.

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:29.202
Hmm...

00:09:29.202 --> 00:09:31.237
So then what's our mission, sir?

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:34.107
Do you want us to check out
Project Shadow for you?

00:09:34.107 --> 00:09:37.610
No. We already have an agent
assigned to that duty.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:41.581
I want you to find out why Dr. Eggman
is so interested in Project Shadow,

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:43.349
and what he's planning to do with it.

00:09:43.349 --> 00:09:45.385
Okay...

00:09:45.385 --> 00:09:47.287
Our passengers are leaving.

00:09:47.287 --> 00:09:49.089
You can stop the car here.

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:51.758
I know the president wouldn't
want me to break the law, miss,

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:54.394
so I'll wait 'til I can
pull safely to the curb.

00:09:55.328 --> 00:09:56.863
[Tires screeching]

00:09:58.998 --> 00:10:00.934
Alright, Rouge. Where do we start?

00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:03.803
First we have to get Eggman to meet with us.

00:10:03.803 --> 00:10:07.207
Fat chance! He isn't exactly fans of ours.

00:10:07.207 --> 00:10:08.274
You're right.

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:11.077
So we'll have to find
some bait to lure him in.

00:10:11.077 --> 00:10:13.680
Which means we'll need a Chaos Emerald.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:28.094
[Sigh]

00:10:32.265 --> 00:10:33.967
How are you, Chris?

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:35.635
Would you like to have some tea?

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:36.603
Chao chao!

00:10:36.603 --> 00:10:37.570
[Sigh]

00:10:38.271 --> 00:10:39.506
No, thank you.

00:10:39.873 --> 00:10:41.875
What's the matter?

00:10:42.275 --> 00:10:43.810
Nothing, I guess.

00:10:44.677 --> 00:10:46.813
You'll get used to it here.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.182
Maybe. [Sigh]

00:10:50.216 --> 00:10:51.584
Chao!

00:10:57.423 --> 00:10:59.459
Hm? Hm.

00:11:02.428 --> 00:11:04.464
What's wrong? Homesick?

00:11:04.464 --> 00:11:05.999
[Long sigh]

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:07.267
Sorta.

00:11:07.734 --> 00:11:11.304
It always takes some time to get
used to a new place when you move.

00:11:11.304 --> 00:11:14.207
But I'm sure you'll make
lots of new friends here.

00:11:14.607 --> 00:11:17.410
Now you know how Sonic and the others felt.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:18.678
Think about it, Chris.

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:20.813
When Chaos Control sent them to this world,

00:11:20.813 --> 00:11:22.882
they found themselves far from home,

00:11:22.882 --> 00:11:25.118
and they didn't know anybody around here.

00:11:25.118 --> 00:11:27.253
But did they sit around moping?

00:11:27.253 --> 00:11:28.087
Huh!

00:11:43.469 --> 00:11:44.537
You're right!

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:45.805
They didn't give up,

00:11:45.805 --> 00:11:47.507
and I won't either, Grandpa.

00:11:47.507 --> 00:11:49.075
Atta boy!

00:11:52.145 --> 00:11:52.979
[High-pitched crying]

00:11:52.979 --> 00:11:55.181
Huh? Oh!

00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:56.149
What now?

00:11:56.149 --> 00:11:59.519
[Crying]

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:00.954
It's coming from there!

00:12:00.954 --> 00:12:02.789
Don't worry, I'll save ya!

00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:04.224
[Sharp cry]

00:12:06.859 --> 00:12:08.561
Kid! Are you okay?

00:12:09.529 --> 00:12:11.397
Yeah. I'm not hurt.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.301
Aah!

00:12:15.835 --> 00:12:16.869
You?

00:12:16.869 --> 00:12:20.340
[Flustered] Aahhhhhh!

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.175
You rescued me?

00:12:22.175 --> 00:12:25.378
I'da kept quiet if I'd known
<i>you</i> were gonna help me!

00:12:25.378 --> 00:12:27.113
I apologize!

00:12:27.113 --> 00:12:27.981
Huh??

00:12:27.981 --> 00:12:29.616
I'm gone!

00:12:29.616 --> 00:12:31.584
Wait, don't go!

00:12:32.118 --> 00:12:33.319
Why not?

00:12:33.319 --> 00:12:34.854
Because before you go, Sonic,

00:12:34.854 --> 00:12:37.924
I wanna tell you that I'm not gonna
say "thank you" for savin' me!

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:39.359
[Exasperated sigh]

00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:42.328
From now on, if you hear me cryin' for help,

00:12:42.328 --> 00:12:43.796
turn around and run the other way!

00:12:43.796 --> 00:12:45.598
'Cause if you ever try to rescue me again,

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:47.500
you're gonna be sorry!

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.802
Ah... Ah-! I know what you're tryin' to say.

00:12:49.802 --> 00:12:50.903
You're welcome.

00:12:52.171 --> 00:12:54.173
But you can't say I'm welcome,

00:12:54.173 --> 00:12:56.175
'cause I didn't thank you!!

00:13:01.414 --> 00:13:03.650
I still don't see how
getting a Chaos Emerald's

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:05.485
gonna help us accomplish our mission.

00:13:05.485 --> 00:13:06.953
It's simple.

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:09.055
If we want to trick Eggman into talking,

00:13:09.055 --> 00:13:12.525
all we have to do is bring him something
he wants more than anything.

00:13:14.527 --> 00:13:17.930
I guarantee ya this idea's
gonna work like a charm.

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:22.268
[Tracker beeps]

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.738
It's that way!

00:13:31.911 --> 00:13:34.147
Hello! I'm Scarlet Garcia.

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:37.083
I'm a reporter with the
affiliate in Station Square.

00:13:37.083 --> 00:13:38.985
We know who you are.

00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:42.989
Your report on Chaos was an
outstanding piece of journalism!

00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:44.524
Can I have your autograph?

00:13:44.524 --> 00:13:46.259
Uh, thank you!

00:13:47.593 --> 00:13:49.896
Everyone here is so friendly!

00:13:49.896 --> 00:13:52.065
[Chuckles] Your reports are terrific,

00:13:52.065 --> 00:13:54.967
which is why our news
director here wanted to-

00:13:54.967 --> 00:13:56.035
Huh?

00:13:58.805 --> 00:14:01.040
Oh, there you are, Franklin.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.176
Scarlet Garcia is here to see you.

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:04.043
Hello.

00:14:04.043 --> 00:14:05.978
Scarlet, this is Franklin.

00:14:05.978 --> 00:14:07.347
Uh, hi!

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:10.283
He just joined the channel as news director.

00:14:10.283 --> 00:14:11.417
That's great!

00:14:11.417 --> 00:14:13.219
Very nice to meet you, Franklin.

00:14:13.219 --> 00:14:16.756
We have a lot to talk about, Ms. Garcia.

00:14:18.391 --> 00:14:21.294
There's an important story here, Scarlet.

00:14:22.095 --> 00:14:23.429
Project Shadow?

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.899
Yes. You're familiar with the story?

00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:28.801
I... am.

00:14:30.103 --> 00:14:32.972
I understand your late father
was also a journalist,

00:14:32.972 --> 00:14:35.875
and that he investigated
Project Shadow years ago.

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:38.378
I'd appreciate it if you'd get to the point.

00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:39.612
It's simple.

00:14:39.612 --> 00:14:42.248
Somebody's kept the <i>real</i>
story about Project Shadow

00:14:42.248 --> 00:14:43.649
a secret for years,

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:46.886
and I need a reporter with
guts to find out who and why.

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:48.321
No way!

00:14:48.654 --> 00:14:51.290
I want to know, and so do you!

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.025
Aren't you curious?

00:14:53.025 --> 00:14:55.495
Wouldn't your father be?

00:14:56.896 --> 00:15:00.433
I'll watch your back and risk my
life to make sure that you're safe.

00:15:00.433 --> 00:15:02.001
I promise you, Scarlet.

00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:02.969
Trust me.

00:15:02.969 --> 00:15:05.004
We can do this together.

00:15:08.975 --> 00:15:12.345
[Sparkling]

00:15:12.345 --> 00:15:15.548
This is <i>much</i> better
than a measly Chaos Emerald.

00:15:15.548 --> 00:15:16.516
[Grunt]

00:15:16.516 --> 00:15:18.050
But it sure is heavy.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.419
Hey!

00:15:19.685 --> 00:15:22.688
Bring the Master Emerald back here!

00:15:26.359 --> 00:15:28.795
Heh! I'll stop you!

00:15:28.795 --> 00:15:29.829
[Grunt]

00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:31.063
Huh!

00:15:31.631 --> 00:15:32.632
Oof!

00:15:35.134 --> 00:15:36.102
Rouge!

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:38.070
Aah!

00:15:38.571 --> 00:15:39.272
Oof!

00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:40.239
[Groan]

00:15:42.175 --> 00:15:43.276
Hey, Rouge!

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:46.312
Look! I found a Chaos Emerald.

00:15:46.312 --> 00:15:49.782
Fine. I'll keep <i>this</i> one.

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:50.783
Heh...

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:52.051
Not so fast!

00:15:52.051 --> 00:15:53.152
Huh?

00:15:53.486 --> 00:15:56.456
[Sigh] Why does everything
have to be a problem?

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:58.391
Don't you know what that is?

00:15:58.391 --> 00:16:00.827
You're trying to take
away the Master Emerald!

00:16:00.827 --> 00:16:03.229
You're putting us all in danger!

00:16:03.229 --> 00:16:05.631
The Master Emerald keeps the
power of the seven Chaos Emeralds

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:07.099
from going out of control!

00:16:07.099 --> 00:16:09.302
And you're going to help me take it back.

00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:11.604
First you'll have to catch me.

00:16:11.604 --> 00:16:13.105
Come back here!

00:16:13.105 --> 00:16:13.739
[Grunt]

00:16:13.739 --> 00:16:14.807
Ooh!

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:15.875
Aah!

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:19.479
Got ya!

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:22.915
You're... That bat!

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.084
[Grunt]

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.288
Just wait.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.995
What's wrong?

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:43.002
Intruder alert. Intruder alert.

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:47.006
Hostile forces have penetrated
Prison Island defenses at Gate #3.

00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:48.374
This is <i>not</i> a drill.

00:16:48.374 --> 00:16:50.643
Repeat - this is <i>not</i> a drill.

00:16:50.643 --> 00:16:52.578
Secure all entryways.

00:16:52.578 --> 00:16:55.414
Emergency lock down procedures
are effective immediately.

00:16:56.482 --> 00:16:59.385
The intruder is heading
for the research area.

00:16:59.385 --> 00:17:00.853
Security units in the area,

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:02.788
stand by for an assault.

00:17:02.788 --> 00:17:05.224
All other units, prepare to counterattack.

00:17:05.224 --> 00:17:07.159
This is <i>not</i> a drill.

00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:09.128
Repeat - this is <i>not</i> a drill.

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.799
[Maniacal laughter]

00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:16.469
This is more fun than hacking!

00:17:16.469 --> 00:17:17.970
Let's see...

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:21.007
According to that computer file I stole,

00:17:21.007 --> 00:17:23.409
Project Shadow is this way.

00:17:23.409 --> 00:17:25.845
If it's as destructive as
my grandfather claimed,

00:17:25.845 --> 00:17:27.647
then I can use it to rule this world

00:17:27.647 --> 00:17:29.482
and <i>no one</i> can stop me.

00:17:29.482 --> 00:17:31.684
Wait up for us, Doctor!

00:17:31.684 --> 00:17:33.419
[Grunt] [Panting]

00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:35.555
We are going to attack the lab with you!

00:17:39.458 --> 00:17:41.327
No, thanks. I'd rather go it alone.

00:17:41.327 --> 00:17:42.562
BOTH: Ohh!!

00:17:43.095 --> 00:17:45.464
But I am lean! And mean!

00:17:45.464 --> 00:17:47.567
I can kick any robot's hard drive!

00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:50.036
Give us a chance to prove ourselves!

00:17:50.036 --> 00:17:51.337
[Yelp]

00:18:01.213 --> 00:18:02.982
[Evil chuckle]

00:18:02.982 --> 00:18:04.884
So, it's Laser Hunter!

00:18:05.217 --> 00:18:06.052
Oh!

00:18:06.052 --> 00:18:07.019
Shield up!

00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:08.487
[Lasers]

00:18:10.222 --> 00:18:11.490
My turn now!

00:18:12.525 --> 00:18:14.760
[Lasers]

00:18:16.696 --> 00:18:19.098
Ooh hoo hoo hoo hoo!

00:18:19.098 --> 00:18:21.734
I think his hunting license just expired!

00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:23.636
He's where?

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:27.640
Dr. Eggman is attacking the
secret lab on Prison Island.

00:18:30.843 --> 00:18:32.178
Woah!

00:18:35.681 --> 00:18:37.283
Stop cowering!

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:38.584
Let's go!

00:18:38.584 --> 00:18:39.885
Wait for us, Doctor!

00:18:39.885 --> 00:18:41.187
Do not leave us here!

00:18:41.187 --> 00:18:42.688
Here we come!

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.730
I wonder why no more robots are attacking?

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:52.665
We must have defeated them all.

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:58.371
Not quite yet. There's one hiding up ahead.

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:05.544
[Firing]

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:12.885
Huh?!

00:19:14.553 --> 00:19:16.489
Ooh hoo hoo hoo!

00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:18.424
Another crushing victory!

00:19:18.424 --> 00:19:21.427
[Huffing]

00:19:22.395 --> 00:19:23.763
Huh?

00:19:23.763 --> 00:19:25.398
Oh...

00:19:25.398 --> 00:19:28.267
Oh! This room could use a good dusting!

00:19:28.267 --> 00:19:32.138
The machinery has not been
used in a very long time!

00:19:32.972 --> 00:19:35.474
Are you sure this is the right place, Doctor?

00:19:35.474 --> 00:19:38.978
According to the records, the Shadow
creature is sleeping in that machine.

00:19:47.749 --> 00:19:49.718
Time to wake it up!

00:19:49.718 --> 00:19:52.120
First I enter a fake user ID,

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.322
and then I enter the password!

00:19:54.322 --> 00:19:58.293
M-A-R-I-A

00:19:58.293 --> 00:20:00.228
Now I'll give it some juice
with this Chaos Emerald,

00:20:00.228 --> 00:20:01.763
and we're all set!

00:20:15.543 --> 00:20:18.046
Hm... Hmm..!

00:20:19.014 --> 00:20:19.981
Woah!

00:20:24.986 --> 00:20:27.055
[Beeping]

00:20:37.465 --> 00:20:39.534
Aah! You!

00:20:39.534 --> 00:20:41.069
It can't be!

00:20:46.574 --> 00:20:47.842
[Breathes]
