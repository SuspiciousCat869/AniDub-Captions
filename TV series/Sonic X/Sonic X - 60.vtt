just fine on our own,

until we find out.

Eh.

00:09:37.318 --> 00:09:40.087
This must've been the center
of the colony's operations.

I'll see if I can find
anything over here.

00:10:31.639 --> 00:10:33.274
Amy!

00:10:33.274 --> 00:10:35.276
Aah! [Shattering glass]

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.178
Aah!

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:42.992
Aah! [Shattering glass]

00:10:44.694 --> 00:10:46.629
Oof!

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:49.132
Aah!

00:10:49.132 --> 00:10:50.500
Ack!

00:10:50.967 --> 00:10:52.635
Somebody's playing with us.

00:10:52.635 --> 00:10:55.338
Well, I don't like
this game anymore!

00:10:55.338 --> 00:10:56.305
[All gasp]

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:04.547
Sonic, I think it's time
we got out of here.

00:11:04.547 --> 00:11:07.116
Okay. Hang on to me, Amy.

00:11:07.116 --> 00:11:08.918
[Whimpering]

00:11:09.352 --> 00:11:10.853
[Grunting]

00:11:10.853 --> 00:11:11.888
Oh!

00:11:16.626 --> 00:11:18.361
[Grunting]

00:11:18.361 --> 00:11:19.629
We're walled in.

00:11:19.629 --> 00:11:20.863
Now what?

00:11:21.831 --> 00:11:22.865
Huh.

00:11:22.865 --> 00:11:24.200
If you are watching this,

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.736
then you have somehow found
a way onto our planet,

00:11:26.736 --> 00:11:29.138
which was destroyed along
with most of its citizens

00:11:29.138 --> 00:11:31.808
many years ago by evil
Metarex monsters.

00:11:31.808 --> 00:11:34.377
Those of us who survived
built this space colony

00:11:34.377 --> 00:11:35.578
in the hopes that one day,

00:11:35.578 --> 00:11:37.213
we could make contact with others,

00:11:37.213 --> 00:11:39.849
and eventually restore
the glory of our planet.

00:11:39.849 --> 00:11:42.552
But the monsters
destroyed it as well.

00:11:42.552 --> 00:11:43.986
All is lost.

00:11:43.986 --> 00:11:45.088
Destroy them...

00:11:45.088 --> 00:11:47.390
[Static] ...or they [Static]
...will destroy you.

00:11:47.857 --> 00:11:49.859
Why did they do it, Chris?

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.228
[Sighing]

00:11:52.595 --> 00:11:53.663
[Sighing]

00:12:00.403 --> 00:12:02.138
How could we be foolish enough

00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:04.307
to think we could ever defeat them?

00:12:06.676 --> 00:12:08.010
Chris?

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:09.912
Yeah?

00:12:09.912 --> 00:12:12.715
You look like you're
lost in another world.

00:12:12.715 --> 00:12:15.118
Just thinking about one.

00:12:15.118 --> 00:12:16.552
You are?

00:12:16.552 --> 00:12:18.488
You know, it's kind of funny.

00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:21.090
I had a strange dream last
night about this guy

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:22.825
we used to know named Shadow.

00:12:24.794 --> 00:12:27.230
Just when everyone in
my world had lost hope,

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:29.565
he and Sonic made us believe again.

00:12:29.565 --> 00:12:32.068
You mean there's someone
else like Sonic?

00:12:33.035 --> 00:12:34.003
Hmm.

00:12:34.604 --> 00:12:35.538
[Beeping]

00:12:35.538 --> 00:12:36.506
Huh?

00:12:37.807 --> 00:12:39.308
We've got an emergency!

00:12:39.308 --> 00:12:40.510
I lost 'em!

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:41.878
My link with Amy cut off,

00:12:41.878 --> 00:12:43.212
and I can't get through anymore!

00:12:43.212 --> 00:12:44.747
What's going on?

00:12:44.747 --> 00:12:46.015
Chris, the castle!

00:12:46.015 --> 00:12:46.849
Ah.

00:12:58.461 --> 00:12:59.428
[Grunt]

00:12:59.428 --> 00:13:00.530
Ahh!

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:01.497
Oof!

00:13:01.831 --> 00:13:02.799
Huh.

00:13:02.799 --> 00:13:04.233
Gotcha!

00:13:05.935 --> 00:13:07.436
Thanks!

00:13:07.436 --> 00:13:08.404
[Grunting]

00:13:10.807 --> 00:13:12.408
Time to fly, Knuckles.

00:13:12.408 --> 00:13:13.810
Ah. [Grunting]

00:13:15.411 --> 00:13:17.747
[Grunting]

00:13:17.747 --> 00:13:19.282
Ah!

00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:23.986
[All screaming]

00:13:27.089 --> 00:13:29.258
Whoa! Whoa!!

00:13:29.258 --> 00:13:30.760
Oh, no!

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.428
[Metarex laughs]

00:13:32.428 --> 00:13:34.230
It appears your friend Sonic

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.766
has sunk to an entirely new low!

00:13:36.766 --> 00:13:37.900
It's talking!

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.404
You meddling fools thought
you could destroy us.

00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:44.907
But in the end, it is
us who will destroy you!

00:13:44.907 --> 00:13:45.908
Sonic!!

00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:46.876
Hang on!

00:13:46.876 --> 00:13:47.844
Ah!

00:14:03.159 --> 00:14:04.126
Aah!

00:14:04.527 --> 00:14:07.163
[Groaning]

00:14:07.163 --> 00:14:08.431
Whoa!

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:10.366
I'm coming!

00:14:10.366 --> 00:14:11.033
[Grunting]

00:14:11.033 --> 00:14:12.301
Okay!

00:14:12.902 --> 00:14:15.938
[Both grunting]

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:21.544
Oof.

00:14:26.082 --> 00:14:27.049
Huh?

00:14:27.049 --> 00:14:29.485
Who knows what that thing's
gonna turn into next?

00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:39.862
Sonic and Knuckles are
sure having a time of it!

00:14:39.862 --> 00:14:42.331
That's one tricky Metarex!

00:14:42.331 --> 00:14:43.733
Speaking of tricky,

00:14:43.733 --> 00:14:46.335
I have an assignment
for you, Rouge.

00:14:46.335 --> 00:14:47.336
Oh, yeah?

00:14:47.336 --> 00:14:49.505
I was wondering when
you'd say that.

00:14:49.505 --> 00:14:53.376
This assignment will require a
great deal of skill on your part.

00:14:53.376 --> 00:14:56.746
If it is done to my satisfaction,
you will get a Chaos Emerald.

00:14:56.746 --> 00:14:57.513
Ah!

00:14:57.513 --> 00:14:59.448
BOCOE AND DECOE: Give
her a Chaos Emerald?

00:14:59.448 --> 00:15:01.017
She's a double crosser!

00:15:01.017 --> 00:15:04.020
Why the sudden generosity, Eggy?

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.889
Just feeling magnanimous, is all.

00:15:06.889 --> 00:15:09.992
I'd be touched if it
wasn't pure baloney!

00:15:09.992 --> 00:15:12.495
Now, don't be that way.

00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:15.998
Don't you at least want to hear
what my brilliant plan is?

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:22.004
Okay, but only for the Emerald.

00:15:22.004 --> 00:15:24.240
I promise you won't regret it!

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.509
[Evil laughter]

00:15:28.644 --> 00:15:31.213
Okay, Tails, the
laser's at full power.

00:15:31.213 --> 00:15:32.848
We've got the target locked.

00:15:32.848 --> 00:15:34.784
Fire the laser in scatter mode.

00:15:34.784 --> 00:15:35.918
Fire!

00:15:48.164 --> 00:15:49.398
It's a bull's-eye!

00:15:49.398 --> 00:15:50.599
Chao chao!

00:15:53.202 --> 00:15:55.137
They got it.

00:15:55.805 --> 00:15:56.772
[All gasp]

00:16:00.109 --> 00:16:02.044
Enough of your child's play.

00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:05.781
Your weapons have no effect
against our omnipresent evil!

00:16:05.781 --> 00:16:06.749
Haha!

00:16:06.749 --> 00:16:08.150
Your destruction is at hand!

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.186
It's too late to turn back!

00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.789
Ah!

00:16:13.789 --> 00:16:15.124
[Panting]

00:16:15.124 --> 00:16:16.092
Okay!

00:16:16.092 --> 00:16:18.327
Activate laser shield right away!

00:16:18.327 --> 00:16:19.362
Okay, Tails!

00:16:20.596 --> 00:16:21.263
Ah!

00:16:21.263 --> 00:16:23.299
[Panting]

00:16:23.299 --> 00:16:25.501
We can take shelter under here!

00:16:25.501 --> 00:16:26.602
Ah!

00:16:28.604 --> 00:16:30.973
It's too powerful for us, Tails!

00:16:30.973 --> 00:16:33.876
I don't think the shield can
hold out for much longer!

00:16:34.243 --> 00:16:35.277
Stay calm!

00:16:35.277 --> 00:16:37.747
We're not gonna let
this thing beat us.

00:16:43.452 --> 00:16:44.720
Hold steady!

00:16:48.557 --> 00:16:50.926
I'm pretty sure that
weird Metarex up ahead

00:16:50.926 --> 00:16:52.828
swallowed the Chaos Emeralds.

00:16:52.828 --> 00:16:56.699
We may beat it if Sonic
uses a ring tunnel!

00:16:56.699 --> 00:16:57.666
Roger.

00:16:58.401 --> 00:16:59.602
Sonic!

00:17:00.336 --> 00:17:01.937
[Grunting]

00:17:02.204 --> 00:17:04.206
[Grunting]

00:17:04.206 --> 00:17:05.574
Ring tunnel!

00:17:07.676 --> 00:17:08.577
Okay!

00:17:21.524 --> 00:17:23.159
Let 'em have it, Sonic!

00:17:23.159 --> 00:17:24.493
You betcha!

00:17:28.944 --> 00:17:30.879
[Grunting]

00:17:36.552 --> 00:17:38.754

00:17:38.754 --> 00:17:40.255
ALL: Oh, no!

00:17:40.255 --> 00:17:43.292
This will be the end of you, Sonic!

00:17:43.292 --> 00:17:46.195
[Evil laugh]

00:17:50.499 --> 00:17:51.900
What do we do?

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.435
He's been hurt!

00:17:56.238 --> 00:17:57.740
I'm coming!

00:17:59.742 --> 00:18:00.843
Turn around!

00:18:00.843 --> 00:18:02.111
It's too dangerous!

00:18:02.111 --> 00:18:03.746
I don't care!

00:18:04.513 --> 00:18:08.350
Aaaaaah!

00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:21.997
Hey!

Wait for me.

00:18:45.788 --> 00:18:46.755
Hmm.

00:18:54.363 --> 00:18:55.197
Hm.

00:18:56.465 --> 00:18:59.301
Now, what's that
blasted code again?

00:19:00.269 --> 00:19:02.271
Time for Chaos Control.
