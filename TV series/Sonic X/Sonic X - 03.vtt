00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.828
[Laughing Evilly]

00:00:27.928 --> 00:00:30.831
Conquering this puny planet
will be a picnic.

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:33.967
As an appetizer,
I'll finish off this city.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.669
Which robot will you use,
Doctor?

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:38.171
Hmm, let's see.

00:00:38.272 --> 00:00:40.407
They all look so lethal.

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:44.144
Hmm, I can't choose.
[Chuckles]

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:55.489
Ah, Missile Wrist.
Perfect!

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.178
This whole thing
is Sonic's fault.

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:20.781
All Sonic did
was try and stop Eggman.

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:23.183
He didn't mean for us
to get sent here.

00:01:23.317 --> 00:01:25.919
Even if Dr. Eggman
is the one to blame,

00:01:26.053 --> 00:01:28.455
Sonic shouldn't
have pushed him so far.

00:01:29.056 --> 00:01:31.692
He's not afraid to fight back!

00:01:32.793 --> 00:01:35.963
Sonic just likes getting
into fights for kicks.

00:01:36.063 --> 00:01:39.967
I'm not going any further
if you talk trash about Sonic.

00:01:40.067 --> 00:01:41.802
I don't have time for this.
See ya.

00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:44.671
You're not gonna leave me
alone down here, are you?

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:47.741
Do what you want.
That's your business.

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:50.677
This is gonna be impossible.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:53.280
Hey, come on, Knuckles!
Don't be mad!

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.514
Wait up!

00:01:54.648 --> 00:01:56.249
Go, go, go, go, go

00:01:56.383 --> 00:01:57.818
Gotta go fast

00:01:58.018 --> 00:02:00.053
Gotta go fast

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.056
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:08.128
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:09.930
Got ourselves a situation

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.232
Stuck in a new location

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:15.736
Without any explanation

00:02:15.836 --> 00:02:17.871
No talk of relaxation

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.506
Don't, don't, don't

00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:21.274
Don't blink, don't think

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:23.110
Just go, go, go, go

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.578
Go, go

00:02:28.382 --> 00:02:30.117
Sonic is on the run

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.052
Sonic, he's number one

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:35.789
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:37.290
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:02:37.391 --> 00:02:39.292

- <i>Sonic</i>

00:02:39.393 --> 00:02:41.862
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:02:41.962 --> 00:02:43.764
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:02:43.864 --> 00:02:46.133
Sonic X

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:48.935
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:02:49.036 --> 00:02:50.971
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:52.873
Sonic X

00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:03.316
That guy is so cute.

00:03:03.417 --> 00:03:05.852
Dude, I totally wiped out
on that monster wave!

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:08.455
- 10 more minutes, kids!
- Oh, Mom!

00:03:13.627 --> 00:03:14.761
Huh? Oh!

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:19.466
[Grunts]

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.168
Whoa!

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:22.903
That's okay.
I've got it.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:25.005
[Laughs]

00:03:25.105 --> 00:03:26.073
Aah!

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.108
[Gasping, murmuring]

00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:45.559
Ooh. Uhh!

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.494
Aah!

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.068
[Gasps]
Aah! Aah!

00:03:57.771 --> 00:04:00.273
[Screaming and shouting]

00:04:07.748 --> 00:04:11.918
There's nothing more fun
than making waves at the beach.

00:04:12.018 --> 00:04:14.654
Well, now that we've established
a beachhead here,

00:04:14.755 --> 00:04:16.923
let's set our sights
on the city.

00:04:22.028 --> 00:04:24.898
I like to keep the Tornado
nice and clean.

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:27.934
Tails, I'd love to study
this plane's mechanics some day.

00:04:28.034 --> 00:04:29.169
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:30.637
Do you like that?

00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:32.773
Mm-hmm!

00:04:32.906 --> 00:04:34.441
I'm glad, Cheese.

00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:35.842
Hey, Tails!

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:37.043
What's wrong?

00:04:37.144 --> 00:04:38.578
Where's Sonic?

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:39.980
He left this morning.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.082
He was going somewhere
to explore.

00:04:42.182 --> 00:04:43.216
Downtown, I think.

00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:46.219
If the police spot Sonic,
they'll try to catch him.

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.622
Catch Sonic?
I don't think so.

00:04:48.722 --> 00:04:50.824
I just hope he's careful.

00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:52.559
Hmm, that's not his style.

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:54.895
Sonic likes danger.

00:04:54.995 --> 00:04:58.298
We have to bring him back!
Right away!

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:05.939
Hold it there!

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:09.075
Take one more step,
and we'll open fire!

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.816
Fire!

00:05:24.224 --> 00:05:25.659
[Sighs]

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:29.596
There's a word for this.
Boring.

00:05:40.874 --> 00:05:42.609
That thing's toast.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.382
[Laughs evilly]
You cannot win.

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:51.751
I can clobber you klutzes
at will.

00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:55.589
Now roll over or get run over.

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.123
We give up.

00:05:57.224 --> 00:06:02.762
I can't stand quitters.
Give them what they deserve!

00:06:07.334 --> 00:06:11.037
This is like trying to find
a hedgehog in a haystack.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.376
Sonic!

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:18.545
Hey, Sonic!

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.450
Sonic!
Are you out there, Sonic?!

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.052
Hey, Sonic!

00:06:26.152 --> 00:06:28.788
I don't think your friend
Sonic is here.

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:31.491
Let's look somewhere else,
Chris.

00:06:55.015 --> 00:06:57.217
[Chuckles]

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:07.794
Wha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha ha!

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:13.033
Knuckles, can't we take a break?

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:16.036
You take one if you want,
but I'm not stopping.

00:07:16.136 --> 00:07:18.038
[Grumbles]

00:07:18.138 --> 00:07:21.041
[Thinking] Casual conversation
would lighten things up.

00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:23.677
So, what do you think
our chances are

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.478
of getting back home, Knuckles?

00:07:25.578 --> 00:07:27.948
We'll get back for sure.

00:07:28.048 --> 00:07:29.282
How can we?

00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:34.220
I don't know, but we will.
Somehow, we will.

00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:38.625
[Thinking] No matter what
it takes, I have to get back.

00:07:38.725 --> 00:07:42.629
It's my mission to guard
the Master Emerald.

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:46.199
Nothing's going to stop me
from doing my job.

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.768
You can count on it.

00:07:48.902 --> 00:07:50.670
Until I do find a way back,

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:53.273
I'm not going to rest
or get sidetracked.

00:07:53.406 --> 00:07:55.041
- [Rumbling]
- Huh?

00:08:00.447 --> 00:08:01.414
What's that?

00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:02.749
Ohh!

00:08:14.928 --> 00:08:16.763
Huh?

00:08:20.767 --> 00:08:22.302
Aah!

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:25.972
Aah!

00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:31.845
Aah!

00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:39.319
[Whimpering]

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:48.061
[Chuckles]
Go to the roof.

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:51.097
We can do more damage
from up there.

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:55.568
Acknowledge.

00:09:04.277 --> 00:09:06.346
Ho ho ho ho ho!

00:09:06.446 --> 00:09:10.183
It appears we're
attracting a crowd.

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:16.990
Proceeding to
upper structural surface.

00:09:24.497 --> 00:09:26.399
Oh!

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:35.775
Let's get this show on the air.

00:09:37.277 --> 00:09:39.779
Please allow me
to introduce myself.

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:43.483
My name is Dr. Eggman, and I
have some exciting news for you.

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:46.419
Exciting for me, that is,
and catastrophic for you.

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:48.655
I have decided
to take over your world

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:50.924
and make it part
of the new Eggman Empire.

00:09:51.024 --> 00:09:52.158
Resistance is futile.

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:53.593
You will submit to my rule

00:09:53.693 --> 00:09:55.929
or be swept away
like dust bunnies.

00:09:56.029 --> 00:09:58.164
Oh, ho ho ho ho!

00:09:58.298 --> 00:10:00.200
So Eggman is here.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.802
Turn yourself in now, bub,
or we'll haul you in!

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:04.737
You must be joking.

00:10:04.838 --> 00:10:06.873
We're not playing around
here, buddy.

00:10:07.006 --> 00:10:09.609
Pull over and let's see
your license and registration!

00:10:09.709 --> 00:10:11.177
[Grumbles]

00:10:11.311 --> 00:10:14.848
I am the one giving
the orders here!

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:17.617
Oh, yeah?!
What makes you think so?!

00:10:17.717 --> 00:10:19.919
This makes me think so.

00:10:23.256 --> 00:10:24.958
Aah!

00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:31.731
Now will you surrender
your city?

00:10:31.865 --> 00:10:34.234
Ah, sorry, Doc.
That's not my call.

00:10:34.334 --> 00:10:36.736
We need to run it by the mayor.

00:10:36.836 --> 00:10:40.473
Then go and bring him to me.

00:10:45.178 --> 00:10:48.448
Come on, Chris.
Let's go!

00:10:48.548 --> 00:10:50.450
Ready, Tails!

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:55.889
Good luck up there,
and be careful.

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:57.023
We'll be okay.

00:10:57.123 --> 00:10:59.425
We'll find Sonic
and stop Dr. Eggman.

00:10:59.559 --> 00:11:00.727
Don't you worry!

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.462
Goodbye, guys.

00:11:02.595 --> 00:11:05.064
Okay, Chris.
Hang on!

00:11:17.443 --> 00:11:19.045
Who are you?

00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:22.815
I am the mayor of this city,
and I won't be blackmailed

00:11:22.916 --> 00:11:25.285
into negotiating
with the likes of you!

00:11:25.385 --> 00:11:26.719
Really?

00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:28.521
Heh heh heh!

00:11:30.123 --> 00:11:31.958
Aah!

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:43.536
Mayor, now are you ready
to negotiate with me?

00:11:43.636 --> 00:11:45.972
[Coughing]

00:11:48.641 --> 00:11:50.910
Technically, sir,
our charter doesn't allow me

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:53.046
to surrender the city.

00:11:54.747 --> 00:11:57.150
Missile Wrist,
destroy this place before...

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.184
Eggman!

00:11:58.284 --> 00:11:59.652
Aah!

00:12:02.689 --> 00:12:04.090
Ohh!

00:12:07.293 --> 00:12:11.264
It's Tails!
I'll teach that flying furball.

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:14.734
Attention, Missile Wrist.

00:12:14.834 --> 00:12:17.870
Take aim at that plane.
Blast it out of the sky!

00:12:17.971 --> 00:12:19.606
Acknowledge.

00:12:25.345 --> 00:12:27.880
Those came pretty close!

00:12:27.981 --> 00:12:30.984
Two can play at that game.
Hang on!

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:46.499
It's no use!
Its armor's too thick!

00:12:46.633 --> 00:12:48.601
Hey, Tails, look out!

00:12:49.235 --> 00:12:50.970
Ohh!

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:51.971
[Grunts]

00:12:56.943 --> 00:13:00.580
This is what I call
an emergency!

00:13:09.222 --> 00:13:11.190
We're in the jet set!

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:11.991
Ohh!

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.065
Tails is in trouble!

00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:21.367
We got to find a way
to help him!

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:23.436
I've got more
important things to do.

00:13:23.536 --> 00:13:26.072
Fine!
Who needs you?!

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:28.274
Don't go in there!

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.212
She's only gonna
get herself hurt.

00:13:38.017 --> 00:13:39.252
- Amy!
- Huh?

00:13:39.352 --> 00:13:41.087
Amy!

00:13:41.187 --> 00:13:42.789
Hmm.

00:13:42.889 --> 00:13:45.058
Stop!
[Grunts]

00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:48.094
Great.
What'll I do now?

00:14:00.973 --> 00:14:02.508
What's going on up there?

00:14:02.608 --> 00:14:04.344
That's a robot on the roof.

00:14:04.444 --> 00:14:06.479
This could be
an interplanetary invasion.

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:09.315
[All talking]

00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:12.318
Oh, ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!

00:14:12.418 --> 00:14:16.289
Eggman. So that clown
got sent here, too.

00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:23.996
Time for me to join the party.

00:14:36.242 --> 00:14:39.212
All right, I need a strategy.

00:14:41.314 --> 00:14:44.016
What took you so long?
Ugh!

00:14:44.117 --> 00:14:46.719
Hyah!

00:14:46.819 --> 00:14:49.722
Leave Tails alone,
you tin bully!

00:14:49.822 --> 00:14:52.458
Don't do it, Amy!

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.261
[Grunts]

00:14:57.864 --> 00:14:59.432
Uh-oh!

00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:01.734
Aah!

00:15:06.339 --> 00:15:09.876
Aah!
Hang on, Amy!

00:15:09.976 --> 00:15:11.978
Hold it, knucklehead!

00:15:12.478 --> 00:15:15.882
One more step,
and the girl's a goner.

00:15:15.982 --> 00:15:19.886
No!
Knuckles!

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:27.527
I better pick up the pace if I
want to be part of the action!

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:36.803
Leave Amy alone,
or you'll be sorry!

00:15:36.903 --> 00:15:37.970
Sorry?

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.973
I'm already sorry that you
and your friends have survived.

00:15:41.073 --> 00:15:44.043
My consolation is
that it seems Sonic didn't.

00:15:44.143 --> 00:15:45.812
Huh? Hmm?

00:15:45.912 --> 00:15:47.413
Or did he?

00:15:47.513 --> 00:15:50.249
Perhaps this is all a trap!

00:15:50.917 --> 00:15:53.753
What if Sonic doesn't make it?

00:15:53.853 --> 00:15:54.821
Oh?

00:15:57.423 --> 00:15:59.826
It's okay!
Help is on the way!

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.327
Huh?

00:16:03.095 --> 00:16:06.098
Get 'em, Sonic!
Ha ha!

00:16:06.232 --> 00:16:07.667
Ohh!

00:16:07.767 --> 00:16:09.135
[Chuckling]

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:18.911
Thanks.

00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:20.913
Ha ha ha ha!

00:16:21.013 --> 00:16:24.584
There he is.
Get ready to fire.

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:28.054
No!

00:16:28.688 --> 00:16:30.490
No!

00:16:32.685 --> 00:16:34.386
Ha ha ha!

00:16:39.291 --> 00:16:41.694
Hurry!
Fire!

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.902
Finally.

00:16:52.271 --> 00:16:53.439
Hmm?

00:16:56.609 --> 00:16:58.744
Fire away!

00:17:04.483 --> 00:17:05.985
Ha ha!

00:17:07.853 --> 00:17:10.756
Wise guy!
I'll show you!

00:17:10.856 --> 00:17:12.291
[Humming]

00:17:14.126 --> 00:17:15.294
Sonic!

00:17:15.394 --> 00:17:18.197
Try the old slap on the wrist!

00:17:18.297 --> 00:17:19.298
Yeah!

00:17:23.002 --> 00:17:24.036
Mmm!

00:17:27.506 --> 00:17:29.141
Bye!

00:17:29.241 --> 00:17:30.643
Fire!

00:17:38.083 --> 00:17:40.486
Ha ha!

00:17:44.857 --> 00:17:46.992
[Chuckling]

00:17:56.769 --> 00:17:58.671
All right, Sonic!

00:18:02.574 --> 00:18:04.943
[Coughing]

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:12.818
You lose.

00:18:12.951 --> 00:18:15.688
This isn't over, blue boy.

00:18:15.821 --> 00:18:17.690
You haven't heard the last
of Eggman!

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:20.526
Soon I will rule this world,
this universe,

00:18:20.626 --> 00:18:23.562
and the Chaos Emeralds
will be mine!

00:18:23.662 --> 00:18:26.131
Oh, ho ho ho ho!

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:32.137
Oh, Sonic! Sonic!
You're okay!

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:33.706
[Straining]
Take it easy!

00:18:33.806 --> 00:18:35.240
For a while there, Sonic,

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.576
I thought I'd never
see you again!

00:18:37.676 --> 00:18:39.912
Amy, please, let me go!

00:18:40.012 --> 00:18:41.914
Hmm.

00:18:43.582 --> 00:18:44.983
Huh?

00:18:47.953 --> 00:18:49.855
All right.
Nobody move.

00:18:50.456 --> 00:18:52.858
Oh, great.
Now what?

00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:55.594
Don't try running away.

00:18:57.663 --> 00:19:00.833
Knuckles never runs
from a fight.

00:19:01.433 --> 00:19:03.335
Hey, easy, pal.

00:19:03.435 --> 00:19:04.503
[Grumbling]

00:19:04.603 --> 00:19:06.438
Sonic!

00:19:09.908 --> 00:19:12.544
Hey, Knuckles!
Come on!

00:19:13.412 --> 00:19:15.314
Please, Knuckles!
Let's go!

00:19:15.414 --> 00:19:18.150
[Grumbling]

00:19:18.283 --> 00:19:19.918
Get him!

00:19:33.699 --> 00:19:35.901
We'll go back to my house, guys!

00:19:36.001 --> 00:19:38.937
Cream and Cheese are already
there waiting for us.

00:19:39.037 --> 00:19:42.441
Wow! Them too?
So we're all here together.

00:19:42.541 --> 00:19:45.944
Count me out.
This is where I get off.

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:49.882
No!
Don't go!

00:19:49.982 --> 00:19:52.384
See ya around.

00:19:56.622 --> 00:20:00.025
He's not coming with us?
Why not?

00:20:01.059 --> 00:20:04.062
That's Knuckles.
He does things his way.
