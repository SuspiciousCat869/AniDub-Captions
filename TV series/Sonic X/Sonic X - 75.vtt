00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.668
Last time on Sonic X,

00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:04.505
our heroes made a crash-landing
on a peculiar planet

00:00:04.505 --> 00:00:06.206
where they learned
a shocking secret.

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:08.242
Not only was it Cosmo's home world,

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:10.544
it was also the birthplace
of the Metarex.

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:13.680
Devastated by this discovery,
Cosmo was about to flee

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.915
when Bokkun suddenly broke in

00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:17.084
with an emergency message
from Dr. Eggman.

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:19.953
It appears the Metarex were meeting
to carry out their final mission,

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:22.289
which would end in a
cosmic catastrophe.

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.457
Now, with time running out,

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:25.959
Sonic and friends must
rush to rescue the galaxy.

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:27.794
Will they finally finish
off the Metarex?

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:29.763
Or are they destined
to go down in defeat?

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:31.698
Find out next on Sonic X!

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:33.834
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:36.904
Gotta go fast

00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:39.873
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:45.679
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.748
Got ourselves a situation

00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:49.783
Stuck in a new location

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:53.387
Without any explanation

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.455
No talk of relaxation

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:57.090
Don't, don't, don't

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.892
Don't blink, don't think

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:00.694
Just go, go, go, go

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:02.195
Go, go

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.701
Sonic is on the run

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:09.603
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:13.340
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.044
-<i>Gotta go fast</i>
-<i>Sonic</i>

00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:19.446
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:21.348
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:01:21.348 --> 00:01:23.850
Sonic X

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.786
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.589
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:29.623
Sonic X

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.842
I've secretly been working
to infiltrate the Metarex

00:01:39.842 --> 00:01:41.611
and find out what they're up to.

00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:44.681
But it looks like they finally figured
out I've been deceiving them.

00:01:44.681 --> 00:01:48.551
Dr. Eggman, a huge Metarex
battleship is closing in fast!

00:01:48.551 --> 00:01:51.187
Its laser cannons are
pointed right at us!

00:01:51.187 --> 00:01:53.589
Your panicking is pointless.

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:56.659
Defeat is inevitable, so
let's face it with dignity.

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.227
The Metarex are on the move,

00:01:58.227 --> 00:02:01.631
heading towards galactic
coordinates 0, 0, 0.

00:02:01.631 --> 00:02:05.168
One of their legends talks about a
time when the thousand-year wait ends,

00:02:05.168 --> 00:02:06.970
and night and day become one.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.137
I'm not sure what it means,

00:02:08.137 --> 00:02:10.306
but my guess is that
something extraordinary

00:02:10.306 --> 00:02:12.041
happens in that
region of space once

00:02:12.041 --> 00:02:13.242
every thousand years.

00:02:13.242 --> 00:02:14.911
And it's about to happen again.

00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:15.712
Aaaaah! Aaaaah!

00:02:15.712 --> 00:02:18.581
The Metarex are sending every ship
in their fleet to rendezvous there.

00:02:18.581 --> 00:02:21.184
You'd have to be out of your
minds to try and intercept them,

00:02:21.184 --> 00:02:23.419
so I assume that's what
you're going to do.

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:27.290
[Laughing]

00:02:28.224 --> 00:02:31.227
Hm. I got away just as
they began attacking.

00:02:31.227 --> 00:02:33.162
ALL: Hmm.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.099
I hope you don't mind my asking,

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.768
but why are those numbers
on your TV counting down?

00:02:38.768 --> 00:02:42.271
Mmm, I forgot these messages
self-destruct at the end.

00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:43.239
[All yelp]

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.274
Cover your ears! It's
gonna be a big bang!

00:02:45.274 --> 00:02:47.210
[Explosion]

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.177
BOKKUN: [Nervous chuckle]

00:02:48.177 --> 00:02:51.047
Betcha didn't know watching
TV could be so exciting.

00:02:51.047 --> 00:02:52.982
CREAM: That was not fun!

00:02:52.982 --> 00:02:55.251
AMY: I'll never tune
into that channel again.

00:03:01.357 --> 00:03:04.293
The end is at hand!

00:03:08.431 --> 00:03:12.068
The forestation of the
galaxy is about to begin!

00:03:12.068 --> 00:03:15.538
Soon the Metarex will
be all-powerful!

00:03:15.538 --> 00:03:16.506
[All gasp]

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.544
KNUCKLES: You can't operate
the ship from here.

00:03:21.544 --> 00:03:22.912
There's no controls.

00:03:22.912 --> 00:03:24.414
There are controls here!

00:03:24.414 --> 00:03:26.015
They're just hidden away.

00:03:32.755 --> 00:03:33.723
ALL: Huh!

00:03:38.194 --> 00:03:39.862
TAILS: I built this secret bridge

00:03:39.862 --> 00:03:42.231
just in case the original
one ever got wrecked.

00:03:42.231 --> 00:03:45.268
But can this beaten-up barge fly?

00:03:46.235 --> 00:03:48.738
The ship's engines were
damaged pretty bad, but

00:03:48.738 --> 00:03:50.606
we still have enough power.

00:03:56.245 --> 00:03:59.215
Put it into launch mode, Chris!

00:04:16.966 --> 00:04:18.234
Hmm...

00:04:23.106 --> 00:04:24.240
Hold it, hedgehog!

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.741
Huh?

00:04:33.216 --> 00:04:36.119
There's a big fleet of
Metarex ships ahead.

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:38.955
Their coordinates are 0, 0, 0.

00:04:38.955 --> 00:04:41.691
That's just where
Eggman said they'd be.

00:04:52.768 --> 00:04:55.304
Increase engine
speed to full power.

00:04:55.304 --> 00:04:57.607
Set the course for Dark
Oak's command ship.

00:04:57.607 --> 00:04:58.808
Roger.

00:05:01.477 --> 00:05:03.045
Begin the attack.

00:05:03.045 --> 00:05:04.680
We'll wipe them out!

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.315
No survivors!

00:05:06.315 --> 00:05:07.683
Hm.

00:05:14.757 --> 00:05:17.059
Two Metarex are
heading right at us!

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:19.495
We have to stop 'em
before they attack!

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.932
Get to your ships and
launch a counter strike!

00:05:22.932 --> 00:05:24.433
ALL: Roger!

00:05:39.882 --> 00:05:42.251
It's time to go
wreck those Metarex!

00:05:46.989 --> 00:05:48.624
Sonic, catch!

00:05:49.592 --> 00:05:50.826
Thanks, Chris!

00:05:50.826 --> 00:05:51.494
[Grunt]

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.234
Huh!

00:05:58.768 --> 00:05:59.468
[Grunt]

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.638
Sonic's attack didn't work.

00:06:02.638 --> 00:06:04.574
Fire lasers!

00:06:09.345 --> 00:06:10.146
[Grunting]

00:06:12.848 --> 00:06:13.816
[All gasp]

00:06:16.852 --> 00:06:20.356
Rouge, Knuckles, get to the flight
deck to stop that Metarex!

00:06:21.857 --> 00:06:25.728
My looks are even more
striking than my attacks.

00:06:25.728 --> 00:06:27.663
Let's charge 'em together.

00:06:27.663 --> 00:06:29.232
Ready when you are.

00:06:29.232 --> 00:06:31.734
KNUCKLES: Aren't you even
gonna put up a fight?

00:06:32.401 --> 00:06:34.136
If you insist.

00:06:34.136 --> 00:06:36.505
But you weaklings can't
possibly harm me.

00:06:36.505 --> 00:06:39.809
You won't think so high of
yourself after I knock you down.

00:06:43.179 --> 00:06:44.947
You broke my mirror!

00:06:44.947 --> 00:06:47.216
Be grateful you don't have
to look at yourself anymore.

00:06:47.216 --> 00:06:48.417
This is no joke.

00:06:48.417 --> 00:06:50.720
Soon you'll be howling... in pain!

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.755
Now you're makin' me angry!

00:06:52.755 --> 00:06:55.157
[Grunt] Double Claw!

00:06:55.157 --> 00:06:57.860
Aaah!

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.129
[Grunting]

00:07:01.564 --> 00:07:03.032
Huh!

00:07:03.032 --> 00:07:03.866
Ah!

00:07:03.866 --> 00:07:05.134
Sonic!

00:07:10.106 --> 00:07:12.041
This is for hurting Sonic!

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:26.822
I wish I knew what Dark
Oak's next move was.

00:07:32.328 --> 00:07:34.864
We're comin' out of warp space now.

00:07:39.001 --> 00:07:41.904
If you need a ride back, we got
a round trip special today.

00:07:41.904 --> 00:07:44.807
It's a 45% discount
off our standard fare!

00:07:44.807 --> 00:07:46.008
Hmm.

00:07:46.008 --> 00:07:47.443
He's a tough sell.

00:07:47.443 --> 00:07:50.413
Luckily for you, there's no
charge for first time customers.

00:07:50.413 --> 00:07:53.716
That's the last time I ever give
a lift to a hitchhiking hedgehog.

00:07:53.716 --> 00:07:56.319
I'm sick of taking jobs
where we lose money.

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:57.653
Our business is going bust!

00:07:57.653 --> 00:07:59.188
I ain't interested
in your opinions.

00:07:59.188 --> 00:08:00.823
I'm the boss around here!

00:08:00.823 --> 00:08:02.758
Where do you wanna get
dropped off, buddy?

00:08:02.758 --> 00:08:03.726
Huh?

00:08:03.726 --> 00:08:05.161
Hey!

00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:10.466
You'd better buckle up. We could
be in for a rough landing.

00:08:18.788 --> 00:08:21.224
At lease we made it in one
piece, but now we got to

00:08:21.224 --> 00:08:23.326
build ourselves a new
detective office.

00:08:26.196 --> 00:08:28.265
Yo, pal. Wait!

00:08:28.265 --> 00:08:31.167
A "thank you" wouldn't
cost ya nothin'.

00:08:31.167 --> 00:08:34.271
You should at least tell us why
you crash-landed us on this ship.

00:08:34.905 --> 00:08:37.173
I have to find Dark Oak
and have a showdown.

00:08:41.077 --> 00:08:44.981
Well, as long as we're here, we might
as well battle the Metarex, too.

00:08:44.981 --> 00:08:45.949
All right!

00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:47.517
This'll be fun.

00:08:47.517 --> 00:08:49.719
That depends on how
you define "fun."

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:55.058
Whoa!

00:08:55.058 --> 00:08:57.594
I wish there was some way
we could abandon ship.

00:08:57.594 --> 00:08:58.094
Yeah.

00:08:58.094 --> 00:09:00.463
You know, that isn't
such a bad idea.

00:09:00.463 --> 00:09:01.998
[Chuckle]

00:09:01.998 --> 00:09:05.568
Hey, Dr. Eggman is sending
out a rescue signal.

00:09:05.568 --> 00:09:10.407
Sonic, I'm gonna fly into the command
ship and set Dr. Eggman free.

00:09:10.407 --> 00:09:11.574
Okay!

00:09:11.574 --> 00:09:13.777
Amy, continue the
attack with Sonic.

00:09:13.777 --> 00:09:14.744
Roger!

00:09:14.744 --> 00:09:16.513
Sonic and I will
conquer those Metarex

00:09:16.513 --> 00:09:19.449
using the invincible
power of our love.

00:09:19.449 --> 00:09:20.417
[Nervous chuckle]

00:09:23.086 --> 00:09:24.587
[Metarex jabbering]

00:09:24.587 --> 00:09:26.456
Chaos Spear!

00:09:26.456 --> 00:09:27.190
[Metarex scream]

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:29.192
Huh! Where's Dark Oak?

00:09:31.695 --> 00:09:36.666
[Metarex jabbering]

00:09:39.035 --> 00:09:40.670
Now that was a smash.

00:09:42.372 --> 00:09:43.673
It's all clear.

00:09:43.673 --> 00:09:44.574
Great.

00:09:44.574 --> 00:09:45.875
With those Metarex gone,

00:09:45.875 --> 00:09:47.477
we can break free!

00:09:47.477 --> 00:09:49.145
You'd better stand back.

00:09:49.145 --> 00:09:50.780
We can blow up these bars.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.115
Decoe! Bocoe!

00:09:52.115 --> 00:09:53.516
BOTH: Yes, Doctor.

00:09:53.516 --> 00:09:56.786
Now we finally get to
show our explosive side.

00:09:56.786 --> 00:09:58.088
Begin merge!

00:09:58.088 --> 00:09:59.889
Assuming head shot position.

00:09:59.889 --> 00:10:02.826
Decoe Bocoe Brain Bazooka, fire!

00:10:03.593 --> 00:10:04.260
Uh.

00:10:05.695 --> 00:10:06.529
Huh.

00:10:06.529 --> 00:10:10.066
That was awesome, but I do
have a bit of a headache now.

00:10:10.066 --> 00:10:12.068
We look cute on the
outside, but inside,

00:10:12.068 --> 00:10:13.703
we are mean machines.

00:10:13.703 --> 00:10:15.872
It was very brave
of you to come here.

00:10:15.872 --> 00:10:17.140
Thanks, Doctor.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.476
You've got a lot of
guts for a little kid.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.380
Now, let's hack into their system.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:24.881
Destruct code verified.

00:10:24.881 --> 00:10:26.082
Detonating Corridor D.

00:10:26.082 --> 00:10:27.217
[Metarex yell]

00:10:28.318 --> 00:10:30.653
[Screaming]

00:10:30.653 --> 00:10:32.389
ALL: Whoa! [Panting]

00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:34.391
I altered this ship's
energy output.

00:10:34.391 --> 00:10:37.394
The ship's main power circuits
are overloading now.

00:10:37.794 --> 00:10:39.362
BOTH: Brilliant idea, Doctor!

00:10:48.805 --> 00:10:50.840
Surprise!

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.442
[Yelling]

00:10:52.942 --> 00:10:54.344
A bull's-eye!

00:10:54.344 --> 00:10:55.478
Chao chao!

00:10:56.179 --> 00:10:59.349
How dare you try to
damage my perfect face?

00:11:00.717 --> 00:11:02.118
Quick! Give me your hand!

00:11:02.118 --> 00:11:02.886
Hm?

00:11:02.886 --> 00:11:05.055
What an odd time to
suddenly get romantic.

00:11:05.055 --> 00:11:06.156
Hold tight!

00:11:06.156 --> 00:11:08.591
[Grunting]

00:11:08.591 --> 00:11:11.094
Spin Throw!

00:11:12.662 --> 00:11:13.596
Huh!

00:11:13.596 --> 00:11:14.564
Aah!

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.769
Tell me where Dark Oak is.

00:11:20.303 --> 00:11:21.337
Huh?

00:11:22.572 --> 00:11:24.174
Never mind.

00:11:26.076 --> 00:11:28.144
Shadow is heading for the bridge.

00:11:28.144 --> 00:11:31.081
Dismantle the hull and outer
structure of the ship.

00:11:31.081 --> 00:11:32.082
Yes, sir.

00:11:42.826 --> 00:11:44.761
The ship is falling apart!

00:11:44.761 --> 00:11:47.297
They're wrecking their own
ship, just to get rid of us!

00:11:47.297 --> 00:11:51.334
[All screaming]

00:11:51.334 --> 00:11:51.768
Huh?

00:11:51.768 --> 00:11:52.235
Oof!

00:11:52.235 --> 00:11:53.103
You okay?

00:11:53.103 --> 00:11:54.204
Aah!

00:11:54.204 --> 00:11:55.038
[Grunt]

00:11:55.038 --> 00:11:57.173
[Screaming]

00:11:57.173 --> 00:11:58.408
Whoa-oa!

00:12:19.896 --> 00:12:23.633
You guys went to all this trouble
just to build a tree house?

00:12:23.633 --> 00:12:24.467
Hm?

00:12:24.934 --> 00:12:26.569
[Screaming]

00:12:26.569 --> 00:12:27.370
Hm.

00:12:28.138 --> 00:12:31.474
Something's distorting the
gravity in this part of space.

00:12:31.474 --> 00:12:32.108
[Gasp]

00:12:32.108 --> 00:12:34.077
It's expanding rapidly.

00:12:34.077 --> 00:12:35.612
What's going on?

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.983
The thousand year wait ends!

00:12:39.983 --> 00:12:42.619
Night and day become one!

00:12:42.619 --> 00:12:46.122
And two worlds come together!

00:12:50.827 --> 00:12:52.162
Huh?

00:13:15.818 --> 00:13:17.720
That's a Planet Egg.

00:13:20.723 --> 00:13:22.659
The thousand year wait ends.

00:13:22.659 --> 00:13:24.260
Night and day become one.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.196
And two worlds come together.

00:13:35.405 --> 00:13:36.673
Of course.

00:13:36.673 --> 00:13:37.941
Once every thousand years,

00:13:37.941 --> 00:13:39.709
a space-time rupture
must occur in this

00:13:39.709 --> 00:13:41.211
part of the galaxy.

00:13:41.778 --> 00:13:45.448
That light is breaking through from
an entirely different universe.

00:13:45.448 --> 00:13:46.950
We're all doomed!

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.852
There's a huge amount of energy
that's coming from that thing!

00:13:49.852 --> 00:13:52.455
Our sensors overloaded when
I tried to get a reading.

00:13:52.455 --> 00:13:54.924
This must be what the
Metarex were waiting for.

00:13:54.924 --> 00:13:55.892
Sonic!

00:13:55.892 --> 00:13:59.262
I'd better end this before Dark
Oak ruins the galaxy forever.

00:13:59.262 --> 00:13:59.996
Huh!

00:14:04.534 --> 00:14:07.270
I've got to stop them
before forestation starts!

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:08.238
[Grunt]

00:14:09.105 --> 00:14:10.473
You fool.

00:14:10.473 --> 00:14:13.810
We are on the verge of a
galactic transformation!

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:16.479
No one can stop us!

00:14:21.217 --> 00:14:22.085
Whoa!

00:14:22.085 --> 00:14:24.020
Huh!

00:14:24.587 --> 00:14:26.022
Whoaaaaa!

00:14:26.022 --> 00:14:26.990
[Grunt]

00:14:28.057 --> 00:14:30.193
Planet Egg is water.

00:14:30.193 --> 00:14:32.662
Chaos Emerald is light.

00:14:32.662 --> 00:14:35.231
They both give us power.

00:14:35.231 --> 00:14:39.535
It is water and light that
make all plants grow.

00:14:39.535 --> 00:14:44.007
We will now give birth
to... Forestation!

00:15:02.992 --> 00:15:05.561
The Metarex have long
awaited this moment.

00:15:05.561 --> 00:15:08.464
We will now bring perfect order
and peace to this galaxy,

00:15:08.464 --> 00:15:10.667
and to the entire universe!

00:15:10.667 --> 00:15:12.902
Forestation has finally begun!

00:15:12.902 --> 00:15:15.238
Long rule the Metarex!

00:15:27.091 --> 00:15:31.262
Aaah!

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.899
[Groaning]

00:15:36.267 --> 00:15:40.205
[Yelling]

00:15:40.205 --> 00:15:43.308
[All yelling]

00:15:48.279 --> 00:15:49.514
[Gasp]

00:15:54.252 --> 00:15:55.753
[All gasp]

00:15:58.289 --> 00:15:59.991
[Straining]

00:16:18.943 --> 00:16:33.358
[All roaring]

00:16:34.559 --> 00:16:37.028
[Both gasp]

00:16:37.495 --> 00:16:38.963
What are they?

00:16:38.963 --> 00:16:42.533
They are in the last stage of
the Metarex Forestation Project.

00:16:42.533 --> 00:16:45.036
The galaxy will be
taken over by plants,

00:16:45.036 --> 00:16:48.139
and all animal life
forms will be wiped out.

00:16:48.139 --> 00:16:49.774
We have to attack!

00:16:49.774 --> 00:16:51.342
All ships launch missiles now!

00:16:54.412 --> 00:17:00.118
[Roaring]

00:17:00.118 --> 00:17:01.052
Huh!

00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:12.397
[Grunting]

00:17:13.898 --> 00:17:20.238
[Roaring]

00:17:20.238 --> 00:17:21.205
Huh!

00:17:21.205 --> 00:17:24.075
Whoooaa!

00:17:24.809 --> 00:17:26.311
Let go, Sonic!

00:17:26.311 --> 00:17:28.479
Whoa! Whoa!

00:17:28.479 --> 00:17:31.449
[Roaring]

00:17:31.449 --> 00:17:33.451
[Both yelling]

00:17:37.121 --> 00:17:39.023
[Growling]

00:17:39.023 --> 00:17:40.558
They're after the Master Emerald!

00:17:40.558 --> 00:17:41.192
[Gasp]

00:17:41.192 --> 00:17:43.161
[Roaring]

00:17:49.434 --> 00:17:50.835
We won't let you take it!

00:17:50.835 --> 00:17:51.936
[Growl]

00:17:55.106 --> 00:17:55.740
Huh!

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.543
[Metarex roaring]

00:18:00.878 --> 00:18:06.617
[Roaring]

00:18:08.553 --> 00:18:09.620
[Gasps]

00:18:12.623 --> 00:18:14.592
Tails! Cosmo!

00:18:14.592 --> 00:18:16.394
Aaaah!

00:18:16.394 --> 00:18:17.929
Hang on, Amy!

00:18:17.929 --> 00:18:18.663
[Grunt]

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.067
Ah!

00:18:23.067 --> 00:18:25.003
[Both panting]

00:18:25.003 --> 00:18:27.538
It looks like we're losing.

00:18:30.608 --> 00:18:32.543
You pitiful animals!

00:18:32.543 --> 00:18:33.878
Now that you are vanquished,

00:18:33.878 --> 00:18:36.914
you see the true superiority
of the Metarex.

00:18:36.914 --> 00:18:39.083
But you still have one last chance

00:18:39.083 --> 00:18:42.620
to save yourselves from
certain destruction.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.822
Come to your senses, Sonic.

00:18:44.822 --> 00:18:48.926
Join us, and we will bring
order and peace to the galaxy.

00:18:48.926 --> 00:18:50.595
Sonic!

00:18:51.562 --> 00:18:53.164
I'll never join with you!

00:18:53.164 --> 00:18:55.033
[Growling]

00:18:55.033 --> 00:18:57.135
Don't fight them, Sonic!

00:18:57.135 --> 00:19:00.138
They're so powerful now you'll
be destroyed for sure!

00:19:00.138 --> 00:19:03.641
Sorry, I can't let them take
over the galaxy without a fight.

00:19:04.275 --> 00:19:07.612
If you wanna rule, you'll
have to get rid of me, first.

00:19:07.612 --> 00:19:09.547
So be it, Sonic.

00:19:09.547 --> 00:19:11.482
If you wish to be eliminated,

00:19:11.482 --> 00:19:14.118
we will be happy to help you.

00:19:14.118 --> 00:19:16.120
Farewell, hedgehog.

00:19:16.888 --> 00:19:18.823
Just don't hurt Amy!

00:19:18.823 --> 00:19:20.391
Ah! Whoaa!

00:19:20.391 --> 00:19:21.893
Whoa!

00:19:21.893 --> 00:19:23.661
Sonic!

00:19:23.661 --> 00:19:24.896
[All gasp]

00:19:24.896 --> 00:19:27.065
Whoa! Whoa!

00:19:27.065 --> 00:19:29.100
Sonic, no!

00:19:35.573 --> 00:19:37.842
You have lost, Sonic.

00:19:37.842 --> 00:19:41.145
Water is your weakness,
and our strength.

00:19:41.145 --> 00:19:43.881
We will now spread
across the galaxy,

00:19:43.881 --> 00:19:47.318
and there will be
no one to stop us.
