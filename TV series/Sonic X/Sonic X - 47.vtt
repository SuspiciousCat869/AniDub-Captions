00:00:01.902 --> 00:00:03.837
Headquarters! This is the Seahawk!

00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:05.472
We're running into heavy fog!

00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:06.874
Visibility is near zero!

00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:08.075
Come in, Headquarters!

00:00:08.075 --> 00:00:09.276
Do you read me?

00:00:09.276 --> 00:00:11.011
You're breaking up, Seahawk.

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:12.279
Please repeat.

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:15.182
I don't know where all this
interference is coming from, sir.

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:17.885
Unless there's somebody out
there jamming our signals.

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:19.386
What's that?

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:20.654
You spot something?

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:24.258
We're picking up a large object
heading straight for us, sir.

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:25.659
What is it, a ship?

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:26.627
I don't think so.

00:00:26.627 --> 00:00:27.694
Huh?

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:32.533
Sound the alarm!

[Alarms blaring]

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:35.502
Headquarters! This is
the Seahawk calling!

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:36.436
Over!

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:37.738
Go ahead, Seahawk.

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:46.580
We've encountered an unknown vessel

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.881
and we're under attack!

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:48.715
Huh?

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.684
Seahawk, what's going on? Over.

00:00:50.684 --> 00:00:53.687
Turn us around! Before
it's too late!

00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:55.022
Hurry!

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:57.558
Seahawk, what in blazes
is happening out there?

00:00:57.558 --> 00:01:00.260
[Static and shouting]

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.195
Mayday! May-

[Static]

00:01:03.597 --> 00:01:05.065
Seahawk! Do you read me?

[Static]

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:07.868
Seahawk, come in!

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:09.503
Seahawk!

00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:11.805
Seahawk!

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:13.440
Seahawk!

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:21.615
Go, go, go, go, go

00:01:21.615 --> 00:01:24.718
Gotta go fast

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:27.654
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:33.460
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.529
Got ourselves a situation

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:37.564
Stuck in a new location

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:41.134
Without any explanation

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:43.203
No talk of relaxation

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:44.871
Don't, don't, don't

00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:46.673
Don't blink, don't think

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:48.475
Just go, go, go, go

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:49.977
Go, go

00:01:53.647 --> 00:01:55.515
Sonic is on the run

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:57.417
Sonic, he's number one

Sonic X

00:02:22.865 --> 00:02:25.435
Naval authorities report that
the research vessel, Seahawk,

00:02:25.435 --> 00:02:26.736
is missing at sea.

00:02:26.736 --> 00:02:29.639
Rescue teams are combing the area
for its last known position.

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.375
So far, there are no
signs of the vessel.

00:02:32.375 --> 00:02:35.511
These pictures were taken two days
ago when it left on its mission.

00:02:35.511 --> 00:02:37.680
Details of that mission
are being kept secret,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.984
but sources tell SSTV that
everything seemed to be going well

00:02:40.984 --> 00:02:44.921
until early this morning, when the
crew radioed to report heavy fog.

00:02:44.921 --> 00:02:47.390
See, that's why I
can't stand water.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.359
You like it if it's in a glass.

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:50.960
That's a start.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.928
Chao!

00:02:51.928 --> 00:02:54.831
Maybe the ship hit something
after it went into the fog.

00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:56.766
A ship like that has instruments

00:02:56.766 --> 00:02:59.068
that let it navigate
through fog safely.

00:02:59.068 --> 00:03:01.604
There may be something
else going on here.

00:03:02.038 --> 00:03:03.539
What do you mean, Grandpa?

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:06.442
What if the Seahawk's disappearance
wasn't an accident?

00:03:06.442 --> 00:03:09.345
Other vessels have encountered
strange phenomenon in that area.

00:03:09.345 --> 00:03:12.281
Perhaps we should take the
yacht and have a look.

00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:15.184
Does that mean you're
going out on the ocean?

00:03:15.184 --> 00:03:16.719
Yes, that's possible.

00:03:19.288 --> 00:03:21.824
You're thinking that Emerl's
down there somewhere.

00:03:21.824 --> 00:03:23.026
Hey, Cream,

00:03:23.026 --> 00:03:25.662
I'm gonna go outside and pick
a whole bunch of flowers.

00:03:25.662 --> 00:03:26.796
Wanna join me?

00:03:26.796 --> 00:03:29.432
Sure, we can give them
to my mom and Ella.

00:03:29.432 --> 00:03:30.667
Chao, chao!

[Pandemonium]

00:03:33.736 --> 00:03:35.171
Mayday! May-!

00:03:37.473 --> 00:03:40.410
[Sigh] Our rescue teams
searched the entire area,

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.713
but haven't found a single sign
of the Seahawk or its crew.

00:03:43.713 --> 00:03:47.450
How could a ship of that size
disappear without leaving a trace?

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.353
Well, what if somebody
made the ship disappear?

00:03:50.887 --> 00:03:53.056
If a thief was planning
to steal a ship,

00:03:53.056 --> 00:03:55.191
he'd make sure not to
leave any evidence behind

00:03:55.191 --> 00:03:56.659
that could clue in the cops.

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:59.028
Maybe we have a
robbery on our hands.

00:03:59.896 --> 00:04:01.264
I hope you're wrong, Rouge.

00:04:01.264 --> 00:04:04.434
That ship is packed with top-secret
communications equipment that

00:04:04.434 --> 00:04:07.804
could easily tap into data from
all of our military satellites.

00:04:08.337 --> 00:04:09.539
What's your point?

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:12.442
Mr. President, if some maniac
were to capture that ship,

00:04:12.442 --> 00:04:15.044
he'd have access to all the
data in our defense network,

00:04:15.044 --> 00:04:17.880
and he could easily bring the
entire country to its knees.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.216
Hmm. I think I smell a rotten egg.

00:04:20.583 --> 00:04:21.551
Eggman.

00:04:22.518 --> 00:04:23.486
Hm.

00:04:23.486 --> 00:04:26.389
I hate to say it, but
you may be right, Rouge.

00:04:26.856 --> 00:04:29.225
This is just the kind of insane
plot he'd come up with.

At least try to sit up
straight when you type.

You mean, that's what inspired
you to become a butler?

00:07:06.682 --> 00:07:08.885
Yes. You taught that
household servants

00:07:08.885 --> 00:07:11.354
played a vital role
throughout history.

You always were unique.

00:07:18.995 --> 00:07:22.298
I was at the palace doing some
research when those two thugs

00:07:22.298 --> 00:07:24.700
attacked me and ran
away with the map.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.502
It's not a total loss, though.

00:07:26.502 --> 00:07:28.504
At least we have a digital copy.

00:07:28.504 --> 00:07:31.073
Interesting. Why were
you studying it?

Are you familiar with
the legend of Murasia?

00:07:34.143 --> 00:07:35.311
Is it a place?

00:07:36.946 --> 00:07:39.649
Murasia is a continent
that sank into the sea.

00:07:40.082 --> 00:07:42.551
It was the home of a
spectacular civilization

00:07:42.551 --> 00:07:44.287
that flourished and died long ago.

00:07:44.287 --> 00:07:45.721
According to the legends,

00:07:45.721 --> 00:07:48.658
the Murasians possessed
a highly advanced culture

00:07:48.658 --> 00:07:51.427
and accomplished spectacular
feats of engineering.

00:07:51.427 --> 00:07:54.230
However, in spite of all
its amazing achievements,

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:58.034
the magnificent Murasian civilization
was wiped out in an instant.

00:08:01.671 --> 00:08:03.806
If the legends are
even partly true,

00:08:03.806 --> 00:08:07.643
then the ruins of that civilization
could hold priceless secrets.

00:08:07.643 --> 00:08:11.347
First, the Seahawk is lost,
and then this map is stolen.

00:08:11.347 --> 00:08:13.482
I have a feeling there's
some kind of connection,

00:08:13.482 --> 00:08:15.685
but I'm not sure what it could be.

00:08:15.685 --> 00:08:18.587
The Seahawk was
searching for Murasia.

00:08:18.587 --> 00:08:21.090
It was using this map as a guide.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:24.126
You see, the map reveals
the continents of our world

00:08:24.126 --> 00:08:26.295
as they were in the distant past.

00:08:26.862 --> 00:08:28.564
Here, I'll show you.

00:08:28.564 --> 00:08:30.166
Now, when we adjust the data,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.235
it reveals how our world appeared

00:08:33.235 --> 00:08:36.806
prior to the volcanic eruption
that destroyed Murasia.

00:08:38.841 --> 00:08:40.443
You see there?

00:08:40.443 --> 00:08:43.346
One piece is missing, just
like in a jigsaw puzzle.

00:08:43.346 --> 00:08:47.283
It's the final clue we need
to find the lost continent.

00:08:47.283 --> 00:08:48.651
I see it now.

00:08:48.651 --> 00:08:50.920
That is where Murasia was located.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.121
Exactly.

00:08:52.121 --> 00:08:55.024
Further analysis reveals that
a piece of the continent

00:08:55.024 --> 00:08:56.492
survived the disasterĂ˘ÂÂ

00:08:56.492 --> 00:08:58.861
a tiny island, which
exists to this day.

00:08:58.861 --> 00:09:01.764
And that's exactly where
the Seahawk disappeared.

00:09:04.433 --> 00:09:10.139
[Band plays]

00:09:10.139 --> 00:09:11.707
Bye-bye now!

00:09:11.707 --> 00:09:13.042
Chao chao!

00:09:13.042 --> 00:09:14.744
Have a safe voyage!

00:09:14.744 --> 00:09:15.745
Later!

00:09:15.745 --> 00:09:17.046
Bye, guys!

00:09:17.046 --> 00:09:18.647
We'll take lots of pictures for ya!

00:09:18.647 --> 00:09:20.282
Bye, sweetie!

00:09:20.783 --> 00:09:24.153
CREAM: Bye, and be careful!

00:09:40.236 --> 00:09:42.171
Getting there won't be easy.

00:09:42.171 --> 00:09:45.608
That island is really just
the top of a huge volcano.

00:09:45.608 --> 00:09:48.277
There's a whole chain of
volcanoes underwater here,

00:09:48.277 --> 00:09:51.881
making this one of the most unstable
regions in the whole world.

00:09:52.748 --> 00:09:54.950
This whole story seems wacky to me.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:57.153
The doctor knows what
he's talking about.

00:09:57.153 --> 00:10:00.656
You're just getting nervous
because you're surrounded by H2O.

00:10:00.656 --> 00:10:03.092
Water doesn't scare me anymore.

00:10:03.826 --> 00:10:06.062
I just don't like gettin' wet.

00:10:10.566 --> 00:10:11.901
Well, there it is, guys.

00:10:11.901 --> 00:10:14.470
Let's go ashore now, so
we can get off this tub.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:16.405
You're not in charge here, Sonic.

Aah! The X Tornado!

00:10:54.877 --> 00:10:57.046
That ship belongs to Eggman.

00:10:57.046 --> 00:11:00.783
[Laughter]

00:11:01.584 --> 00:11:05.455
Captain Eggman has an important
maritime message for ya!

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.359
Surrender to me now!

00:11:09.359 --> 00:11:12.695
My new Egg Battleship has enough
firepower to take on the Navy,

00:11:12.695 --> 00:11:14.731
the Air Force, and Sonic, too!

00:11:15.131 --> 00:11:17.300
You stole that map
from Dr. Cadbury!

00:11:18.034 --> 00:11:19.235
You think so?

00:11:19.235 --> 00:11:21.537
Now, why would I do
a thing like that?

00:11:21.537 --> 00:11:23.640
Just because you're so despicable.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.644
That map led me here to
the world's hot spot.

00:11:27.644 --> 00:11:29.412
I don't follow you.

00:11:29.412 --> 00:11:30.246
I do.

00:11:30.246 --> 00:11:33.449
A hot spot is supposedly the weakest
part of the planet's crust.

00:11:33.449 --> 00:11:36.185
If a volcano inside
the hot spot erupts,

00:11:36.185 --> 00:11:38.688
all the other volcanoes
in the world erupt, too.

00:11:38.688 --> 00:11:42.492
But no respectable geologist
believes such a bizarre theory.

00:11:42.492 --> 00:11:45.094
Well, excuse me, Dr.
I-Know-Everything!

00:11:45.094 --> 00:11:46.996
But whether you realize it or not,

00:11:46.996 --> 00:11:49.432
you're floating above
a hot spot right now!

00:11:49.432 --> 00:11:51.367
Now I see what you're getting at.

00:11:51.934 --> 00:11:53.936
The legends are vague,

00:11:53.936 --> 00:11:56.205
but it's possible
that the Murasians

00:11:56.205 --> 00:11:59.542
somehow caused the deadly
volcanic eruptions.

00:11:59.542 --> 00:12:01.744
Didn't any Murasians survive?

00:12:01.744 --> 00:12:04.947
It's likely that the Murasians
were all wiped out.

00:12:04.947 --> 00:12:07.850
There's no trace of them
in the archeological record

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:09.786
after the volcano erupted.

00:12:10.219 --> 00:12:12.855
I don't have time to listen
to you academic airheads

00:12:12.855 --> 00:12:16.025
discuss a bunch of scholarly
mumbo jumbo, thank you.

00:12:16.526 --> 00:12:20.363
The Murasians cracked open that hot
spot once, and sank a continent.

00:12:20.363 --> 00:12:24.233
Now I'm going to blast it open,
and cause a worldwide catastrophe!

00:12:24.233 --> 00:12:27.937
And on the ruins that remain,
I'll build the Eggman Empire!

00:12:28.438 --> 00:12:29.405
Oh, yeah?

Dr. Eggman has his defenses down.

00:14:03.499 --> 00:14:05.568
Now we can blast him
out of the water.

All right!

00:14:07.503 --> 00:14:09.071

it to attack me!

They certainly are clever.

It just goes to show the
importance of recycling.

we'll destroy your ship!

00:17:59.602 --> 00:18:01.537
I just changed my mind!

00:18:01.537 --> 00:18:02.972
I want revenge.

00:18:02.972 --> 00:18:03.939
He is dependable.

00:18:03.939 --> 00:18:07.576
Yes, no matter what, Dr. Eggman
never fails to let you down.

00:18:20.623 --> 00:18:21.590
What's that?

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:22.558
[Gasp]

00:18:23.125 --> 00:18:24.093
[All gasping]

00:18:26.562 --> 00:18:27.530
[All gasping]

00:18:28.297 --> 00:18:29.265
[All gasping]

00:18:34.036 --> 00:18:36.038
Fire energy ray!

00:18:39.542 --> 00:18:41.477
There's nothing we can do.

00:18:50.327 --> 00:18:51.294
Aah!

00:18:52.829 --> 00:18:56.333
Surrender now, or we will fire
the energy ray in ten seconds.

00:18:56.333 --> 00:18:57.300
We don't have any time!

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.502
We can't give up!

00:18:58.502 --> 00:19:00.370
Maybe if we attack it together!

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:01.571
It's worth a try!

00:19:02.172 --> 00:19:03.507
Oof!

00:19:03.507 --> 00:19:04.274
Uh!

00:19:04.274 --> 00:19:09.479
[Both grunting]

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.788
[All screaming]

00:19:25.996 --> 00:19:27.564
All right!

00:19:27.564 --> 00:19:28.498
[Chuckling]

00:19:31.067 --> 00:19:32.035
We are doomed!

00:19:32.035 --> 00:19:34.070
Oh dear, oh, dear, oh dear!

00:19:35.038 --> 00:19:37.440
ALL: We still have our hostages!

00:19:38.408 --> 00:19:39.809
Not any more.

00:19:40.343 --> 00:19:41.945
[All yelling]

00:19:41.945 --> 00:19:44.548
Face it, Doc, there's
no way out this time.

00:19:44.548 --> 00:19:46.716
[All yelling]

00:19:46.716 --> 00:19:49.619
ALL: Huh? Huh? Huh??

00:19:49.619 --> 00:19:52.289
Hey! Where'd my Chaos Emerald go?

00:19:52.289 --> 00:19:55.058
Huh? Huh? Ah!

00:20:01.565 --> 00:20:04.301
Stop pushing! Back
off! I can't steer!

00:20:04.301 --> 00:20:06.236
Spread out! Gah!

00:20:10.073 --> 00:20:12.008
Oh, Rouge.

00:20:12.576 --> 00:20:13.944
Sorry.

00:20:18.548 --> 00:20:20.817
Maybe this trip was a big mistake.

00:20:20.817 --> 00:20:23.053
Maybe we never should've come.

00:20:30.393 --> 00:20:32.696
If Eggman finds the
ruins of Murasia,

00:20:32.696 --> 00:20:34.097
it could be dangerous.

00:20:34.097 --> 00:20:35.865
Yes.

00:20:35.865 --> 00:20:38.301
I'm beginning to think
that Eggman was right,

00:20:38.301 --> 00:20:40.704
and that this place
really is a hot spot.
