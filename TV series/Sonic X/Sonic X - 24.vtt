Sonic!

00:00:26.627 --> 00:00:27.761
Bring her back!

[Laughs]

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:31.765

Hey, that's a brand-new
dress, fatty.

Amy!
You just hang on tight!

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.215
Go, go, go, go, go

00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:49.783

Don't worry, Amy.
I got ya.

Isn't this just beautiful?

I wish we could stay here
for days

00:02:43.697 --> 00:02:45.666
and just listen to the wind.

Oh, wouldn't that be romantic?

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.608
Have you been listening?

Hey, Amy,
what's all the shouting about?

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:32.145
Your friend Sonic's acting
weirder than ever.

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:34.314
What do you mean,
he's acting weird?

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:37.117
He's off in his own
little world.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.885
That's not weird, Amy.

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:40.120
That's Sonic.

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:41.254
He's worse than ever.

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:44.191
He hasn't listened to a word
I've said all day.

00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:46.593
Well, maybe he's got something
on his mind.

00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:49.930
I should've known
you wouldn't understand!

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:08.115
He thinks he's stressed?

What did you say?

00:04:12.786 --> 00:04:15.522
The only way to find out what's
really going on with Sonic

00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:17.524
is to follow him
in the X Tornado.

00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:19.192
Hmm.

00:04:30.771 --> 00:04:31.838
I don't get it.

Listen, punk,

but if you don't wear
seat belts, you're a fool.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.625
Huh?
That was Sonic!

00:04:51.725 --> 00:04:54.027
Thanks to him, you're not
getting a ticket today.

Now go get a haircut!

Looks like he's trying
to catch up with Sonic.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.225
I'm gonna radio him.

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.494
Hey, Uncle Sam.
This is Chris.

00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:31.031
When you're on this frequency,
it's S-Team leader, got it?

00:05:31.131 --> 00:05:33.900
I can't chitchat right now.
I'm on a mission.

00:05:33.967 --> 00:05:36.870
Sorry, but I need to talk to you
about Sonic.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.873
If you're calling to ask me to
take it easy on him, forget it.

00:05:39.973 --> 00:05:42.042
But he's acting really
strange today.

00:05:42.142 --> 00:05:45.111
We're worried that there might
be something wrong with him.

00:05:45.212 --> 00:05:48.114
There must be if he thinks
he can beat me.

00:05:48.215 --> 00:05:49.749
[Laughs]

00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:54.988
He acts weirder than Sonic.

00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:01.261
I got him now.

00:06:04.865 --> 00:06:06.266
What's going on?

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:07.767
All right.

00:06:11.638 --> 00:06:13.473
Huh?
Out of gas?

00:06:17.577 --> 00:06:20.046
That little hedgehog
may have outrun me this time.

00:06:20.146 --> 00:06:21.781
But there's always next time.

00:06:21.882 --> 00:06:23.450
I'll get him.

00:06:24.851 --> 00:06:26.586
Hmm.

00:06:27.988 --> 00:06:29.789
Hmm? Oh.

00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:31.725
Oops.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:38.999
[Horn blares]

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.073
I hope there's light
at the end of this thing.

00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:56.583
There he is.

00:06:56.683 --> 00:06:58.184
He's heading for the desert.

00:06:58.285 --> 00:07:00.820
I wonder why he's going there.

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:15.568
Still running.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.343
Oh!

00:07:23.944 --> 00:07:25.946
Now he's speeding up again.

00:07:26.046 --> 00:07:27.347
But why?

00:07:30.884 --> 00:07:32.085
Oh!

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:39.292
Maybe something happened
to Sonic

00:07:39.392 --> 00:07:41.361
when he was battling that robot.

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:43.463
That could be why he's acting
this way.

00:07:43.563 --> 00:07:45.465
What could it be?

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:47.467
I don't know.

00:07:47.567 --> 00:07:49.569
Let's go talk to my grandpa.

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:52.672
He might be able to figure out
what's wrong.

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:54.274
I hope so.

00:07:54.374 --> 00:07:56.309
Because if something's wrong
with Sonic,

00:07:56.409 --> 00:07:58.445
it's because he saved me.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.450
Please be okay, Sonic.

00:08:14.728 --> 00:08:18.131
Doctor, here is something
I think you will enjoy.

[Laughs]

00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:22.402
Well, well.

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:24.838
Looks like Sonic's working up
quite a sweat.

00:08:24.938 --> 00:08:27.340
Perhaps you might want to do
the same, Doctor.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.076
You have been getting a bit
round around the waist lately.

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:30.910
What?

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:34.848
Cut the wisecracks or I'll waste
you, you impudent ash can!

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:39.486
Sonic must be up to something.

00:08:39.586 --> 00:08:41.388
But what could it be?

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:44.491
He doesn't stop, Grandpa.

00:08:44.591 --> 00:08:46.893
He just keeps on running.

00:08:46.993 --> 00:08:49.896
We just have to figure out
what's wrong with him.

00:08:49.996 --> 00:08:52.532
The only way to do that
is to examine him.

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:54.367
But first we have to catch him.

00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:57.370
And that's not going to be easy.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:58.772
Hmm.

00:08:58.872 --> 00:08:59.873
Hmm.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.776
I think I may know a way.

[Gasps]

00:09:18.525 --> 00:09:20.527
What's wrong, Sonic?

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.695
Where are you?

With the help of Tails,

00:09:44.184 --> 00:09:46.886
I have devised a plan
that I believe will work.

00:09:46.986 --> 00:09:48.788
It's actually quite simple.

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:52.092
Step one, we locate Sonic
from the X Tornado.

00:09:52.225 --> 00:09:55.695
Step two, we launch a specially
designed bubble bomb

00:09:55.795 --> 00:09:59.666
which will hold him securely
and lift him off the ground.

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:01.468
And once Sonic is off his feet,

00:10:01.568 --> 00:10:04.137
we can discover what's been
causing him to run amok.

00:10:04.237 --> 00:10:06.106
[Cheering]

CHUCK: Roger. Stay alert.
Don't let him out of your sight.

00:11:10.537 --> 00:11:12.105
I'm floating away!

00:11:12.205 --> 00:11:14.908
Perhaps I used too much helium.

00:11:20.047 --> 00:11:21.816
Whoa!

00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:23.451
Help me!

00:11:23.551 --> 00:11:25.886
Somebody get this thing
off of me!

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:29.357
Whoa! Oh!

00:11:30.091 --> 00:11:31.559
What now?

00:11:31.692 --> 00:11:33.594
Hey!
Knuckles!

00:11:33.694 --> 00:11:35.129
Help me!

00:11:35.229 --> 00:11:37.365
Help me!

00:11:37.932 --> 00:11:39.734
Aah! Aah!

00:11:39.834 --> 00:11:42.703
Aah! Ooh! Oh!

00:11:48.676 --> 00:11:51.178
Huh?
What the...

00:11:54.181 --> 00:11:55.650
Now what do we do?

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:57.852
Do you think he'll come back?

00:11:57.952 --> 00:11:59.186
It's all my fault.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.621
Just too much helium.

00:12:00.721 --> 00:12:03.124
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:12:03.224 --> 00:12:05.860
Well, Sonic just tried to
run me over.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.328
Great!
Did you stop him?

00:12:07.428 --> 00:12:09.330
He missed me.
[Chuckles]

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.066
Well, I'm not gonna miss ya.

00:12:12.166 --> 00:12:13.200
What's the big deal?

00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:15.069
All I did was step aside.

00:12:15.169 --> 00:12:17.305
It isn't his fault, Amy.

00:12:17.405 --> 00:12:18.539
Chao!

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:19.607
Cheese is right.

00:12:19.707 --> 00:12:22.043
I bet you come up with
a new way to help Sonic

00:12:22.143 --> 00:12:25.012
after you have a nice hot lunch.

00:12:31.052 --> 00:12:34.855
I bet poor Sonic must be
starving by now.

00:12:34.955 --> 00:12:37.558
I'm sure he's fine, Amy.

00:12:38.559 --> 00:12:39.627
[Gulps]

00:12:39.727 --> 00:12:40.961
Whoa!

00:12:41.062 --> 00:12:44.899
That game looks like
a lot of fun, Tails.

00:12:48.002 --> 00:12:49.737
That's it!

00:12:49.837 --> 00:12:52.006
Knuckles will wait
at the top of a hill

00:12:52.106 --> 00:12:54.342
with a specially engineered
wheel trap.

00:12:54.442 --> 00:12:56.177
As Sonic approaches,
we'll give the signal,

00:12:56.277 --> 00:12:59.714
and Knuckles will roll the wheel
down the hill, trapping Sonic.

00:12:59.847 --> 00:13:01.749
He'll be like a hamster
in a cage.

00:13:01.849 --> 00:13:03.684
[Cheering]

00:13:05.219 --> 00:13:06.153
Huh?

00:13:13.561 --> 00:13:15.996
All right, Tanaka.
He's almost in position.

00:13:16.097 --> 00:13:17.398
Right.

00:13:18.466 --> 00:13:20.101
Roll it!

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.561
[Laughs]

00:13:47.661 --> 00:13:49.530
Hey, Grandpa, it works.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:51.732
Of course it does.

00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:57.738
I thought you might be hungry
after all this running.

00:14:00.141 --> 00:14:02.009
Pretty tasty.

00:14:06.747 --> 00:14:10.351
[Yawns]

00:14:12.453 --> 00:14:14.455
He looks like
he's falling asleep.

00:14:14.588 --> 00:14:15.556
That's good.

00:14:15.656 --> 00:14:17.858
If he falls asleep,
he'll have to stop running.

00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.627
Maybe I can help, Sonic.

00:14:19.727 --> 00:14:21.862
Want me to read you
a bedtime story?

00:14:21.962 --> 00:14:24.865
No, thank you, Amy.

00:14:24.965 --> 00:14:26.767
That looks like fun.

00:14:26.867 --> 00:14:28.602
Exercising, I mean.

00:14:28.702 --> 00:14:30.337
I'm going to start.

00:14:30.438 --> 00:14:33.073
- BOTH: You should.
- Tomorrow.

00:14:33.174 --> 00:14:37.044
TOGETHER: Oh, Dr. Eggman,
tomorrow never comes!

00:14:38.779 --> 00:14:41.382
Looks like Sonic's nap
isn't slowing him down at all.

00:14:41.482 --> 00:14:43.017
He's going even faster.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:44.952
I've never seen anything
like it.

00:14:45.052 --> 00:14:47.154
His energy
is positively boundless.

00:14:47.288 --> 00:14:51.425
Sonic has more power
than my food processor.

00:14:53.794 --> 00:14:57.832
Sonic, that wheel wasn't built
to withstand this intensity!

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.335
Knuckles, look out!

00:15:01.435 --> 00:15:02.736
[All gasp]

00:15:17.551 --> 00:15:19.286
Run!

00:15:24.892 --> 00:15:27.461
Well, that was a washout.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:32.733
So far your plans
haven't worked, have they?

00:15:32.833 --> 00:15:36.370
Not quite, but I'm confident
that if we just keep trying,

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.707
we'll eventually come up
with a plan that will work.

00:15:39.807 --> 00:15:42.710
[Grunts]

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:45.212
Hmm.
I've got it!

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.216
In fact, it's the best plan
I've had all day.

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.652
We just need a little help
from a friend.

00:15:51.752 --> 00:15:53.721
Mm-hmm.

00:15:58.859 --> 00:16:00.628
Sonic is running himself ragged.

00:16:00.728 --> 00:16:03.264
He must feel as worn out
as an old sneaker.

00:16:03.364 --> 00:16:04.832
This would be a perfect time

00:16:04.932 --> 00:16:07.234
to launch a sneak attack
against him.

00:16:07.334 --> 00:16:09.103
- Ready?
- BOTH: Aye, aye!

00:16:09.203 --> 00:16:11.872
I'll destroy him
right after my nap.

00:16:11.972 --> 00:16:13.007
Please, Doctor!

00:16:13.107 --> 00:16:15.476
Now is not the time
for snoozing!

00:16:20.581 --> 00:16:22.950
Right on time.

00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:43.804
I would have been here sooner,
but I stopped for donuts.

00:16:43.904 --> 00:16:46.273
I appreciate you coming
to help us out, Sam.

00:16:46.373 --> 00:16:48.409
You can always count on
the Speed King

00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:51.278
to put the rubber to the road
when a friend needs help.

00:16:51.378 --> 00:16:54.882
Well, then, let me bring you
up to date on our plan.

00:16:54.982 --> 00:16:58.052
Now, we all know Sonic
has quite a competitive streak,

00:16:58.152 --> 00:16:59.453
just like you do, Sam.

00:16:59.553 --> 00:17:01.288
It's Speed King, Chuck.

00:17:01.422 --> 00:17:03.324
Sorry, Speed King.

00:17:03.424 --> 00:17:05.826
The plan is to have
Speed King challenge Sonic

00:17:05.926 --> 00:17:07.061
to a test of speed.

00:17:07.161 --> 00:17:08.562
But unbeknownst to Sonic,

00:17:08.662 --> 00:17:10.965
a trap will be set
at the end of the finish line.

00:17:11.065 --> 00:17:14.201
Speed King will get on
Sonic's right side in lane 2.

00:17:14.301 --> 00:17:17.137
Sonic will be forced to race
in lane 1 beside him,

00:17:17.237 --> 00:17:19.406
and that will lead him
straight into our trap.

00:17:19.506 --> 00:17:21.642
Then Sonic will be
out of the running!

00:17:21.742 --> 00:17:24.144
Now, let's get ready for
the race, shall we?

00:17:24.244 --> 00:17:26.046
ALL:
Yeah!

00:17:32.786 --> 00:17:35.422
Stand by.
He's almost there.

00:17:35.522 --> 00:17:38.158
Roger.
I'm ready.

00:17:40.894 --> 00:17:41.929
Go!

00:17:51.038 --> 00:17:53.273
Whoa!

00:17:53.741 --> 00:17:57.244
What's the matter, slowpoke?
Can't you do better than that?

00:18:06.654 --> 00:18:10.157
This isn't a real race!
You're supposed to be a decoy!

00:18:10.257 --> 00:18:12.092
Guess again, sweetheart!

00:18:12.192 --> 00:18:13.427
He beat me once.

00:18:13.527 --> 00:18:15.462
It's not gonna happen twice.

00:18:15.562 --> 00:18:16.797
Oh!

00:18:19.133 --> 00:18:20.768
Oh, yeah?

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:24.438
They're getting close
to the finish.

00:18:24.538 --> 00:18:26.040
Remember, Speed King,

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.676
whatever you do,
keep Sonic in the right lane.

00:18:28.776 --> 00:18:30.978
Right lane?
I thought I'm in the right lane!

00:18:31.078 --> 00:18:33.580
That's right.
Just stay in lane 2.

00:18:33.714 --> 00:18:36.050
Remember, you're number 2.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:37.584
Number 2.

00:18:37.685 --> 00:18:40.421
Not me, sister!
I'm number 1!

00:18:40.521 --> 00:18:42.322
[Laughs]

00:18:50.431 --> 00:18:52.800
That didn't work out too well.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.869
Hey, Chuck, I'm picking up
something weird on my scopes.

00:18:55.969 --> 00:18:57.738
Do you see it down there, too?

00:18:57.838 --> 00:18:59.773
Yes, I've noticed it myself,
Tails.

00:18:59.873 --> 00:19:02.309
I recorded the wave patterns.

00:19:02.443 --> 00:19:06.447
Maybe you can analyze it
and figure out what it is.

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:10.851
From what I can gather,

00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:13.554
it's some kind of strange
magnetic force field.

00:19:13.654 --> 00:19:17.391
It appears to be emanating
from that ranch up ahead.

00:19:26.767 --> 00:19:28.368
Ready up there, Tails?

00:19:28.469 --> 00:19:30.170
I'm ready when you are.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:36.877
Okay, Tails, keep it
as steady as you can.

00:19:49.123 --> 00:19:51.024
[Screams]

00:19:58.866 --> 00:20:00.768
Amy!

00:20:12.446 --> 00:20:14.581
Sonic!

00:20:19.453 --> 00:20:22.189
Sonic, I was so worried.

00:20:22.289 --> 00:20:23.924
Now what's the matter?

00:20:24.024 --> 00:20:26.527
Something's in my ear again.

00:20:33.967 --> 00:20:35.702
Yeah, that feels much better!

00:20:35.803 --> 00:20:36.770
Thanks!
