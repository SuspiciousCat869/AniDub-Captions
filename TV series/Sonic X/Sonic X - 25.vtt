WEBVTT

00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:03.770
Stand by for takeoff.

00:00:06.507 --> 00:00:09.142
X Tornado, let's go!

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:13.814
Lifting off.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.518
Hold on tight, Sonic.

00:00:17.618 --> 00:00:20.954
It's time to deploy
our stabilizing wings.

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:27.961
Do you think they'll be able
to find that seventh Emerald?

00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:29.196
It's possible.

00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:31.798
But they're not the only ones
who'll be looking for it.

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:33.200
Don't you worry, Creamy.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:36.470
They're going to find that
Emerald before you know it.

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:37.671
Chao!

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:43.911
Any signs of the Emerald yet,
Tails?

00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:44.678
Nope.

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:47.681
Wow, this is so great.

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:49.349
Hmm...

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:52.686
Hey, come on.

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:54.888
Aren't you gonna help look?

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.590
Yeah, sure.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.559
Uh...

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.294
Go, go, go, go, go

00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:01.828
Gotta go fast

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:04.031
Gotta go fast

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:07.067
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:08.702 --> 00:01:12.139
Movin' at the speed of sound,
quickest hedgehog around

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:13.941
Got ourselves a situation

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:16.243
Stuck in a new location

00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:19.780
Without any explanation

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.915
No talk of relaxation

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:23.550
Don't, don't, don't

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.319
Don't blink, don't think

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:27.154
Just go, go, go, go

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:28.622
Go, go

00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:34.161
Sonic is on the run

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:36.063
Sonic, he's number one

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:39.800
Sonic, he's coming next,
so watch out for Sonic X

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.268
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:43.303
- <i>Gotta go fast</i>
- <i>Sonic</i>

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:45.872
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster

00:01:45.973 --> 00:01:47.774
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:50.143
Sonic X

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:52.980
Gotta go faster,
gotta go fast

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.015
Gotta go faster, faster,
faster, faster

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.917
Sonic X

00:02:07.027 --> 00:02:08.929
[Laughing]

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:17.571
It looks like Dr. Eggman
is in a very good mood.

00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:21.642
Yes, he seems especially
confident, doesn't he?

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.746
Something tells me today
could be a very lucky day.

00:02:25.846 --> 00:02:28.248
In fact, those Chaos Emeralds
are as good as mine

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:30.317
if I play my cards right.

00:02:30.417 --> 00:02:31.618
Your cards.

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:32.786
No need.

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:34.621
I've already chosen my weapon.

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:36.123
BOTH:
Huh?

00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:38.725
You mean, a new weapon, Doctor?

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.127
But what is it?

00:02:40.227 --> 00:02:42.929
The suspense is killing me.

00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:50.370
[Beeping]

00:02:53.607 --> 00:02:55.075
You have got to be kidding.

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:57.844
That is the strangest-Iooking
robot I have ever seen.

00:02:57.944 --> 00:03:00.113
Sure, he may look like a loser.

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:02.449
But Lucky here
is exactly the charm we need

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.851
to capture
that final Chaos Emerald.

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:06.553
[Both gasp]

00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:08.021
That's right.

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:09.956
You see,
our plucky little pal here

00:03:10.057 --> 00:03:11.958
possesses that
one elusive quality

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:14.094
that will make that Emerald
practically drop

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:15.696
into our waiting hands.

00:03:15.796 --> 00:03:16.930
So guess.

00:03:17.064 --> 00:03:17.998
BOTH:
What is it?

00:03:18.098 --> 00:03:19.199
It's luck.

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:21.168
BOTH:
Luck?

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:22.569
Just wait.

00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:26.106
With Lucky on our side, we'll
have that Emerald in no time.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:29.743
Good luck, Lucky,
and bring back the prize.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.556
This planet isn't so bad,
I suppose,

00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:45.192
but I'd do anything
to get back home.

00:03:45.292 --> 00:03:47.427
What did that voice say?

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:51.798
WOMAN'S VOICE:
The servers are the seven Chaos.

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:56.970
We can only get back home if we
find all seven Chaos Emeralds.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.307
Well, Sonic and those guys
have four.

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:02.809
Eggman's got one.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.679
And then there's this one
I got from Hawk.

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:07.247
That makes six in all.

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:09.015
But even if we find
the last one,

00:04:09.116 --> 00:04:11.818
we'd still have to convince
Eggman to give up his.

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:15.322
And since Sonic and Eggman
don't exactly see eye to eye,

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:19.092
we'll never get back home unless
I can get them to work together.

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:20.494
- [Beeping]
- Huh?

00:04:23.497 --> 00:04:25.732
What's that?

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:35.242
You must be Eggman's robot.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.247
Yeah?
What are you doing around here?

00:04:48.355 --> 00:04:51.358
Maybe the Emerald
led me here somehow.

00:04:56.763 --> 00:04:58.999
[Bell rings]

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:00.700
Lunchtime, children.

00:05:00.834 --> 00:05:03.136
- All right!
- I'm starving!

00:05:05.272 --> 00:05:08.208
Chris, you want to
eat lunch with us?

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:10.610
Yo, wake up.

00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:14.014
I'm not too hungry
right now, guys.

00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:16.349
Okay.
We'll catch you later, then.

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.151
Yeah, okay.

00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:19.152
[Groans]

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:20.887
Hmm...

00:05:21.788 --> 00:05:23.890
You know, I think
you and I should visit

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.126
the counseling office.

00:05:26.226 --> 00:05:27.994
No, thanks.

00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:30.630
Come on, Chris.
Let's go.

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:35.969
Are you ready, Chris?

00:05:36.102 --> 00:05:37.904
Yeah.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:40.941
Now, tell me, Chris.

00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:42.275
What's bothering you?

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:44.511
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:46.813
Lately, I'm feeling
really confused.

00:05:46.913 --> 00:05:49.282
Like you're torn?

00:05:49.382 --> 00:05:50.283
Yeah.

00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:53.186
I think I understand why.

00:05:53.286 --> 00:05:56.690
Part of you wants to help Sonic
and his friends return home.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.894
But another part of you doesn't
want to lose your new friends.

00:06:00.994 --> 00:06:02.996
It's quite obvious
that this conflict

00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:05.498
is creating a war
deep within you, Chris.

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:07.500
You're right!

00:06:07.634 --> 00:06:10.337
That's just how I feel,
Mr. Stewart.

00:06:10.437 --> 00:06:11.471
It's natural.

00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:13.440
But you must face
the fact that one day

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.475
your friends are going
to return home.

00:06:15.575 --> 00:06:16.543
[Groans]

00:06:16.643 --> 00:06:17.944
It's difficult.

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:20.680
But you have to think
of what's best for them.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.482
I know.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.518
Everything's going to be okay.

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:27.387
I promise you.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:31.691
[Beeps]

00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:32.592
Yes?

00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:35.028
Just checking in,
Chalkboard Charlie.

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:36.596
Any problems?

00:06:36.696 --> 00:06:38.698
No, sir.

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:41.635
Nothing I can't handle.

00:06:43.203 --> 00:06:45.105
So what you're saying, Rouge,

00:06:45.205 --> 00:06:48.108
is that the Chaos Control
explosion that sent Eggman here

00:06:48.208 --> 00:06:51.111
was caused when the seven
Chaos Emeralds came together.

00:06:51.211 --> 00:06:53.780
Right.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.483
Yes, I see.

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:59.286
So if we could create
our own Chaos Control,

00:06:59.386 --> 00:07:01.788
then we just might solve
our Eggman problem.

00:07:01.888 --> 00:07:03.790
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.792
Really?
Why not?

00:07:05.892 --> 00:07:08.895
Mr. President, I think that
we first need to consider

00:07:08.995 --> 00:07:10.397
the effects such an action

00:07:10.497 --> 00:07:12.299
could have on the safety
of the planet.

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:13.633
Like what?

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:15.268
Quiet.

00:07:15.402 --> 00:07:17.470
Go on, Topaz.

00:07:18.071 --> 00:07:19.673
Those Emeralds
might create a blast

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:22.275
that could lead to total
global destruction.

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:24.477
Ask Rouge.
She knows.

00:07:24.577 --> 00:07:26.012
She's right.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.949
Moving forward without
careful consideration

00:07:29.049 --> 00:07:31.017
could create
a worldwide disaster.

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:33.119
I think it's wise to do
everything we can

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:35.121
to keep that
from happening, sir.

00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:36.656
I see.

00:07:36.756 --> 00:07:39.192
Perhaps until we're sure
of what we're getting into

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:41.628
we need to keep
those Emeralds apart.

00:07:41.728 --> 00:07:43.463
I believe so, sir.

00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:51.071
The question is,
how do we manage to do that?

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:54.374
Hi, Ella.

00:07:54.507 --> 00:07:57.644
Ah! Hi, Chris.
Did you have a good day?

00:07:57.744 --> 00:07:59.479
Yeah.
Where is everyone?

00:07:59.579 --> 00:08:03.183
They're out looking for the
Chaos Emerald again, like usual.

00:08:03.283 --> 00:08:05.885
And Grandpa's gone somewhere
looking for new parts

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:07.921
for his crazy machines.

00:08:08.021 --> 00:08:11.658
Thank goodness I can finally
clean up this mess now.

00:08:23.536 --> 00:08:25.939
The place seems empty.

00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:29.009
This is how it was
before they all got here.

00:08:29.109 --> 00:08:32.612
And how it's gonna be
when they go.

00:08:34.047 --> 00:08:35.949
[Laughter]

00:08:49.963 --> 00:08:51.865
KNUCKLES:
Hello.

00:08:51.965 --> 00:08:53.867
[Beeping]

00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:55.068
Hey, Knuckles.

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:56.870
What's going on?

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.071
Plenty.

00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:00.440
Where'd you get that robot?

00:09:01.107 --> 00:09:02.842
Well, it's not exactly mine.

00:09:02.942 --> 00:09:05.779
I think he belongs to Eggman.

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:08.615
I found him just roaming
around the forest.

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:11.851
Seems pretty harmless, though.

00:09:12.452 --> 00:09:13.653
Is Sonic around?

00:09:13.753 --> 00:09:15.622
I've gotta talk
to him about something.

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:18.258
Sorry. He's out looking
for the last Emerald.

00:09:18.358 --> 00:09:19.893
Then give him this message.

00:09:19.993 --> 00:09:22.195
We have only one way
to get back home.

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:24.697
We've got to call a truce
with Dr. Eggman.

00:09:24.798 --> 00:09:26.266
A truce?

00:09:26.366 --> 00:09:27.600
That'll never happen.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.768
It has to.

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:30.503
But how?
They're sworn enemies.

00:09:30.637 --> 00:09:33.106
The only way any of us
will get back home

00:09:33.206 --> 00:09:34.741
is to team up with Eggman.

00:09:34.841 --> 00:09:38.178
I know it might sound crazy,
and it may even be impossible.

00:09:38.278 --> 00:09:39.746
But I have to convince Sonic

00:09:39.846 --> 00:09:42.182
that this is the only chance
we've got.

00:09:42.282 --> 00:09:46.286
We've all been away from
home for way too long now.

00:09:46.386 --> 00:09:48.755
And I'm not about to let
anything stand in our way

00:09:48.855 --> 00:09:50.256
of getting back there.

00:09:50.356 --> 00:09:51.624
Knuckles is right.

00:09:51.724 --> 00:09:53.093
I'm being selfish.

00:09:53.193 --> 00:09:55.562
I've got to do whatever I can
to help them.

00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:56.896
All right, Knuckles.

00:09:56.996 --> 00:09:58.798
I'll give him your message.

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:01.568
Meanwhile, I'll pay a visit
our friend Eggman.

00:10:01.668 --> 00:10:04.370
How will you know
where to find him?

00:10:04.504 --> 00:10:07.073
I think I spotted
his ship over at Forest Hill.

00:10:07.207 --> 00:10:08.875
Bye.

00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:14.047
Knuckles.

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:16.549
Mind if I come along?

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:18.618
Why not?

00:10:27.514 --> 00:10:30.917
The express train'll get us to
Forest Hill in no time at all.

00:10:31.017 --> 00:10:32.552
MAN ON P. A:
Final boarding call.

00:10:32.685 --> 00:10:34.921
Forest Hill Express, track 29.

00:10:35.021 --> 00:10:36.256
[Both gasp]

00:10:48.501 --> 00:10:50.136
[Lucky beeping]

00:11:07.821 --> 00:11:09.689
[Groans nervously]

00:11:09.789 --> 00:11:11.491
Don't worry, Chris.

00:11:11.591 --> 00:11:15.028
Just stay calm,
and I'll do all the talking.

00:11:19.299 --> 00:11:21.601
Hey, the robot.

00:11:21.701 --> 00:11:25.205
Well, easy come, easy go.

00:11:31.077 --> 00:11:32.145
Oh!

00:11:32.245 --> 00:11:33.379
Dr. Eggman!

00:11:33.479 --> 00:11:35.148
Enemy approaching!

00:11:35.248 --> 00:11:36.649
Prepare to launch attack.

00:11:36.749 --> 00:11:38.451
Wait!

00:11:38.585 --> 00:11:40.186
But, Dr. Eggman.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.055
Look there.

00:11:48.595 --> 00:11:50.163
Think of it this way.

00:11:50.263 --> 00:11:52.899
If we team up,
we get the Emeralds together,

00:11:52.999 --> 00:11:55.268
and Chaos Control
sends us straight home.

00:11:55.368 --> 00:11:56.736
But if we keep fighting
like this,

00:11:56.836 --> 00:11:59.005
we'll all be stuck here
for good.

00:11:59.105 --> 00:12:01.074
And that's bad.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:04.677
Yes.

00:12:04.777 --> 00:12:05.778
Yes, yes.

00:12:05.879 --> 00:12:06.980
That's right.

00:12:07.113 --> 00:12:09.716
I'd never thought of it
that way.

00:12:09.849 --> 00:12:13.386
How could I have been such
a brainless, greedy old fool?

00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:14.754
Knuckles!

00:12:14.888 --> 00:12:16.923
I don't know how to thank you.

00:12:17.056 --> 00:12:19.425
The pleasure is all mine,
Dr. Eggman.

00:12:19.525 --> 00:12:20.860
[Sighs]

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.030
However,
I do have one condition.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:27.767
That you allow me to hold
onto your Chaos Emerald.

00:12:27.867 --> 00:12:29.302
You hold it?

00:12:29.402 --> 00:12:31.571
Come, now, don't you trust me?

00:12:31.671 --> 00:12:35.341
Nothing is more important
between allies than trust.

00:12:35.441 --> 00:12:37.210
If you're asking me
to trust you,

00:12:37.343 --> 00:12:39.679
the least you can do
is trust me.

00:12:39.779 --> 00:12:41.547
What do you think?

00:12:41.648 --> 00:12:43.182
You can hold it.

00:12:43.316 --> 00:12:45.251
[Laughs]

00:12:45.351 --> 00:12:46.653
Thanks, Knuckles.

00:12:46.786 --> 00:12:49.022
We make a great team.

00:12:50.256 --> 00:12:52.091
Well, he did it.

00:12:52.191 --> 00:12:54.394
I guess it was the right thing.

00:12:54.494 --> 00:12:57.163
But I don't think
Sonic's gonna like it.

00:12:57.263 --> 00:12:58.765
Well, well, well.

00:12:58.865 --> 00:13:00.767
Who would have thought
our friend Knuckles

00:13:00.867 --> 00:13:02.902
was such an honest fellow?

00:13:03.002 --> 00:13:05.672
As a matter of fact,
I'd say he's honest to a fault.

00:13:05.772 --> 00:13:06.673
What do you mean?

00:13:06.773 --> 00:13:09.042
I mean our
naive little knucklehead

00:13:09.142 --> 00:13:11.144
is playing right into my hands.

00:13:11.244 --> 00:13:13.379
Yes. [Laughs]

00:13:18.785 --> 00:13:20.954
- [Beeping]
- [Cat meows]

00:13:21.087 --> 00:13:22.255
[Beeping intensifies]

00:13:37.337 --> 00:13:39.405
Okay, okay.
A little more.

00:13:49.949 --> 00:13:51.050
Okay, kids.

00:13:51.184 --> 00:13:52.552
It's that time again.

00:13:52.685 --> 00:13:54.354
Everybody dance!

00:13:54.454 --> 00:13:58.691
Dance, dance, dance!

00:13:58.791 --> 00:14:00.693
[Laughter]

00:14:02.795 --> 00:14:04.497
Hey, I'm home.

00:14:04.597 --> 00:14:06.399
Chris, it's late.

00:14:06.499 --> 00:14:07.834
Where have you been
all this time?

00:14:07.934 --> 00:14:10.970
Sorry. I was over
at Danny's house studying.

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:14.474
Oh, by the way, did you guys
find any Chaos Emeralds today?

00:14:14.574 --> 00:14:16.609
We didn't find anything, Chris.

00:14:16.709 --> 00:14:18.878
[Sighs]
That's good.

00:14:18.978 --> 00:14:21.347
I mean, that's bad!

00:14:24.417 --> 00:14:26.152
Guys, what's wrong?

00:14:26.285 --> 00:14:29.222
Our favorite program
won't be on next week.

00:14:29.322 --> 00:14:30.390
Chao! Chao!

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:32.358
Is that all?

00:14:34.193 --> 00:14:35.461
Huh?

00:14:35.561 --> 00:14:37.864
We'll find that last Emerald,
won't we?

00:14:37.964 --> 00:14:40.400
You bet we will, Tails.

00:14:41.734 --> 00:14:45.004
Well, I think I'll go for a run.

00:14:46.339 --> 00:14:47.740
Sonic, wait up!

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.977
That was strange.
Wonder what's wrong.

00:14:53.579 --> 00:14:55.214
So what's up?

00:14:55.348 --> 00:14:59.252
Well, Sonic, I guess
you must get pretty homesick

00:14:59.352 --> 00:15:01.954
being on a different planet
and all.

00:15:02.055 --> 00:15:03.689
I don't think about it too much.

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:04.891
Why?

00:15:04.991 --> 00:15:07.026
Huh? Oh.

00:15:07.126 --> 00:15:09.729
My teacher, Mr. Stewart,
says hi.

00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:11.531
That's nice.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.803
I bet Sonic's just as homesick
as the rest of them.

00:15:16.903 --> 00:15:19.205
He's just afraid to admit it.

00:15:19.305 --> 00:15:20.940
Poor guy.

00:15:24.544 --> 00:15:25.545
Did you get them?

00:15:25.645 --> 00:15:26.546
Mm-hmm.

00:15:26.646 --> 00:15:29.048
I didn't tell anybody
I took them, though.

00:15:29.148 --> 00:15:31.651
It's not like we're doing
anything wrong.

00:15:31.784 --> 00:15:35.121
Once they find out what we did,
they'll probably be grateful.

00:15:35.221 --> 00:15:36.589
Come on.

00:15:54.173 --> 00:15:56.576
The signal's coming from
somewhere around here.

00:15:56.676 --> 00:15:59.378
Just be on your guard, boys.

00:16:01.013 --> 00:16:02.615
Why am I hanging around?

00:16:02.748 --> 00:16:04.050
Just keep watch.

00:16:04.183 --> 00:16:05.785
We're going to find
that Emerald.

00:16:05.918 --> 00:16:07.053
Yeah, okay.

00:16:07.186 --> 00:16:09.555
Oh, by the way,
I know where it is.

00:16:09.622 --> 00:16:10.523
[Gasps]

00:16:14.627 --> 00:16:16.262
Wow.

00:16:17.663 --> 00:16:19.765
Chief, I think we found it.

00:16:20.867 --> 00:16:22.201
[Knock on door]

00:16:22.301 --> 00:16:24.670
Mr. President.
Good news, sir.

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:26.973
We've found Eggman's base.

00:16:27.073 --> 00:16:28.374
Let's make the call.

00:16:28.474 --> 00:16:29.675
Right.

00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:34.780
Report to Area 99.

00:16:34.914 --> 00:16:36.449
Dispatch the beetle immediately.

00:16:36.549 --> 00:16:37.950
You ready?

00:16:38.084 --> 00:16:39.152
Sure.

00:16:39.285 --> 00:16:42.021
Oh, hold on.

00:16:45.424 --> 00:16:48.327
Why are those two here?

00:16:51.564 --> 00:16:52.832
Hey, I... [Gasps]

00:16:55.268 --> 00:16:56.502
Oh, what's up?

00:16:56.602 --> 00:16:58.804
Chris took the Chaos Emeralds.

00:16:58.905 --> 00:17:01.040
- Chao chao chao.
- But why?

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.076
He left us a letter
explaining why.

00:17:04.177 --> 00:17:05.611
"I'm taking the Emeralds

00:17:05.745 --> 00:17:08.381
so that you can all
get back home very soon."

00:17:08.514 --> 00:17:10.449
I can't understand
why in the world

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.351
he would do something
so foolhardy.

00:17:12.485 --> 00:17:14.887
We better go look for him,
Chuck.

00:17:19.192 --> 00:17:23.062
Well, Sonic, I guess
you must get pretty homesick

00:17:23.162 --> 00:17:24.830
being on a different
planet and all.

00:17:24.931 --> 00:17:28.601
Chris took the Chaos Emerald
from inside the X Tornado, too.

00:17:28.701 --> 00:17:31.137
We can only fly it
in normal mode now.

00:17:31.237 --> 00:17:32.471
Aah!

00:17:32.572 --> 00:17:34.473
Where'd he go?

00:18:06.138 --> 00:18:08.174
Ah, my new friends.

00:18:08.274 --> 00:18:09.342
Welcome.

00:18:12.211 --> 00:18:14.046
We brought them.

00:18:14.947 --> 00:18:16.549
Let me see.

00:18:20.152 --> 00:18:22.722
Ooh, my.
Aren't they lovely?

00:18:22.822 --> 00:18:26.525
And I have my Chaos Emerald
right here.

00:18:26.626 --> 00:18:29.362
I could open the box
and show it to you,

00:18:29.462 --> 00:18:32.265
but it's not safe to expose it
to the others.

00:18:32.365 --> 00:18:33.432
Not yet.

00:18:33.532 --> 00:18:34.533
[Chuckles]

00:18:34.634 --> 00:18:36.535
Yeah, I saw him.

00:18:36.636 --> 00:18:37.770
Let's see.

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:41.274
I think he got on the 4:00 train
to Forest Hill.

00:18:41.374 --> 00:18:43.109
To Forest Hill?

00:18:43.242 --> 00:18:46.846
I'll hold onto the Emeralds
and put them in a safe place.

00:18:46.979 --> 00:18:47.813
Uh...

00:18:47.913 --> 00:18:48.948
Okay, Doc.

00:18:49.081 --> 00:18:51.984
Excuse me, Doctor?

00:18:52.084 --> 00:18:55.488
There is an urgent call
from Lucky.

00:18:56.355 --> 00:18:57.957
[Beeping]

00:18:58.057 --> 00:18:59.058
What?

00:18:59.158 --> 00:19:02.194
You've discovered the last Chaos
Emerald in a pile of garbage?

00:19:02.295 --> 00:19:03.696
Well done.

00:19:03.796 --> 00:19:05.731
Stay where you are.
I'll come to you.

00:19:05.831 --> 00:19:08.701
Dr. Eggman,
did he really find it?

00:19:08.801 --> 00:19:10.102
Of course he did.

00:19:10.202 --> 00:19:11.904
Building a robot
who brings good luck

00:19:12.004 --> 00:19:14.940
was my most brilliant
stroke of genius.

00:19:15.341 --> 00:19:17.243
Does this mean
we are out of a job?

00:19:17.343 --> 00:19:18.244
No such luck.

00:19:18.344 --> 00:19:21.247
Well, we have them all,
don't we?

00:19:21.347 --> 00:19:23.316
That's great!

00:19:23.449 --> 00:19:25.951
Yeah, now I can finally go home.

00:19:26.085 --> 00:19:27.553
Ha.

00:19:27.653 --> 00:19:29.689
Okay.

00:19:29.789 --> 00:19:30.923
[Laughter]

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.762
What do you think you're doing,
Eggman?

00:19:36.862 --> 00:19:38.130
[Laughs]

00:19:40.232 --> 00:19:41.767
Wise up.

00:19:41.867 --> 00:19:44.170
You didn't really believe
that I was homesick

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:46.138
like your loser friends,
did you?

00:19:46.238 --> 00:19:50.343
The only thing I care about is
establishing the Eggman Empire.

00:19:50.443 --> 00:19:53.312
I can do that
on my planet or yours.

00:19:53.412 --> 00:19:55.381
It makes no difference to me.

00:19:55.514 --> 00:19:58.417
Then you lied to us, didn't you?

00:19:58.517 --> 00:19:59.752
[Chuckles]

00:19:59.852 --> 00:20:01.921
Ready the Egg Fort II
for takeoff.

00:20:02.021 --> 00:20:03.989
BOTH:
Aye, aye!

00:20:10.396 --> 00:20:12.031
He's leaving.

00:20:12.131 --> 00:20:13.532
H.Q., come in.

00:20:13.632 --> 00:20:15.301
Emergency!

00:20:22.141 --> 00:20:23.709
Eggman!

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.248
Where's Chris?

00:20:29.382 --> 00:20:30.816
Up there.

00:20:30.916 --> 00:20:34.754
Eggman has him in his ship along
with all the Chaos Emeralds.

00:20:39.191 --> 00:20:41.327
Good luck, Sonic!

00:20:45.898 --> 00:20:49.668
Will Sonic stop Eggman
in time to save his friends?

00:20:49.769 --> 00:20:52.605
Find out next time!
