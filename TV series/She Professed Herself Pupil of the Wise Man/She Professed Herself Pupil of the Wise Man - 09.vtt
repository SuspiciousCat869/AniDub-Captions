00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:14.806 position:50% align:center
[AMALATTE] Oh, Mira.
You're here. I wasn't sure.

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.182 position:50% align:center
Yes, what is it, Amalatte?

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.976 position:50% align:center
Are you here to
see Cleos, or...?

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:21.104 position:50% align:center
[AMALATTE] I must ask;
despite what's customary,

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:23.106 position:50% align:center
you're not wearing any bloomers.

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.484 position:50% align:center
Is that normal,
or is today special?

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:28.445 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I can't figure out
how to put them on.

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:30.739 position:50% align:center
Oh, I had no idea.

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:33.074 position:50% align:center
In that case,
why don't I teach you?

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:35.535 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
What <i>are</i> you doing?

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:37.579 position:50% align:center
[AMALATTE] I'm removing mine
and putting them back on

00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:39.456 position:50% align:center
to serve as an example.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:40.790 position:50% align:center
...but this is
highly inappropriate!

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.000 position:50% align:center
And if someone were to see us--

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:43.543 position:50% align:center
--[MARIANA] Um, Miss Mira?
--Mariana!

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:46.046 position:50% align:center
I know this looks bad, but it's
not what you think, I swear!

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.839 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA]
I understand.

00:00:47.922 --> 00:00:50.925 position:50% align:center
And it would be my pleasure to
help educate you on the matter.

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:53.345 position:50% align:center
[MIRA gasps]
Will both of you calm down?

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:55.764 position:50% align:center
Oh. Hey, Cleos! Do something!

00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:58.350 position:50% align:center
It is wonderful
to see you having fun.

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:02.270 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA gasps]

00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:03.688 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
My apologies!

00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:06.107 position:50% align:center
Solomon summoned me,
so I'll be going now!

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:07.484 position:50% align:center
Oh, I didn't realize.

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:08.860 position:50% align:center
Miss Mira, what
about your dinner?

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:11.404 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Sorry! I'll be gone
for a while again!

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:13.406 position:50% align:center
You hold down the fort!

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.284 position:50% align:center
Yes. I'll take good care of it.

00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:19.329 position:50% align:center
I'll be right here,
waiting for you.

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:02.307 position:50% align:center
Looking at the sky,
the world seems endless.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.643 position:50% align:center
Glad I have a steed like you
to take me through it, Pegasus.

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:08.563 position:50% align:center
[whinnies]

00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:11.107 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] When I tried to
summon Eisenfald again,

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:13.360 position:50% align:center
I was told he "attracts
too much attention"

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:17.655 position:50% align:center
and "causes the
citizens to complain."

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.493 position:50% align:center
First Solomon chastises me,
then he puts me to work.

00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:25.330 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] Based on the material
you guys brought back

00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:27.499 position:50% align:center
the other day from
Fool the Wunderkammer,

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:31.211 position:50% align:center
I've decided where you'll be
going on your next adventure.

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:33.254 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Oh-ho, where?

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:36.508 position:50% align:center
It's called Child
of Prayer Forest.

00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:37.801 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
There, huh?

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:39.594 position:50% align:center
That brings back memories.

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:41.012 position:50% align:center
But I must ask,

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:44.641 position:50% align:center
how is Soul Howl related
to the Child of Prayer Forest?

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:46.643 position:50% align:center
Well, we know he's
looking to obtain

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:49.813 position:50% align:center
the Holy Grail of Heavenly
Light however he can,

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:53.358 position:50% align:center
and material to make it
is found in the forest.

00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:55.151 position:50% align:center
You need the root
of a sacred tree

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:58.154 position:50% align:center
that's over 3,000 years old.

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:01.491 position:50% align:center
Ah, the Child of Prayer
Forest's Elder.

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:03.368 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
Yeah, you get it now.

00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:06.705 position:50% align:center
It's not likely Soul Howl
will actually still be there.

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:09.708 position:50% align:center
But, you might be able
to find some trace of him.

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:11.167 position:50% align:center
And, also...

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.794 position:50% align:center
"And also" what?

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:14.129 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
The Primal Forest is near

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:16.756 position:50% align:center
the Child of Prayer
Forest, right?

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.426 position:50% align:center
See, we've got a top-secret
weapon in development,

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:20.635 position:50% align:center
and you might be able to find

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:22.804 position:50% align:center
some material there
we could use.

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:25.181 position:50% align:center
So, you know, I'll be
counting on you and all that.

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.600 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Always an ulterior motive!

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:29.561 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
There's a fort near the forest.

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:32.188 position:50% align:center
So, if you get tired,
you can rest there.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.565 position:50% align:center
[thud]

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:35.817 position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.611 position:50% align:center
A blizzard eagle?

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:40.697 position:50% align:center
I take it you kicked it
out of the air?

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.449 position:50% align:center
[whinnies]

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:45.201 position:50% align:center
There, there. Wait...

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:46.953 position:50% align:center
Hm. Blizzard eagles live

00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:50.206 position:50% align:center
in the northernmost tip
of the continent.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.625 position:50% align:center
For it to appear as far south
as we are right now

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:55.295 position:50% align:center
is rather abnormal.

00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:58.423 position:50% align:center
Perhaps it's just one of the
ways the world has changed.

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:03.178 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Ah, we can see it now.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.536 position:50% align:center
Oh, honestly!

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.122 position:50% align:center
How gigantic is that tree?

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:34.167 position:50% align:center
I can't even get a sense of
the distance we are from it!

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:38.880 position:50% align:center
That must be the fort.

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:41.424 position:50% align:center
I think I'll rest there
for a short while.

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:49.182 position:50% align:center
Seems something attacked.

00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:50.517 position:50% align:center
But what?

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.023 position:50% align:center
Look at that one.

00:06:00.944 --> 00:06:02.320 position:50% align:center
Time we took a break.

00:06:02.404 --> 00:06:03.905 position:50% align:center
[whinnies]

00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:05.949 position:50% align:center
[RATRI]
Uh. Who are you?

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:07.992 position:50% align:center
Are you our reinforcements?

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:09.869 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
I am no one suspicious.

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:12.872 position:50% align:center
I am Mira. Just a
simple adventurer.

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:15.417 position:50% align:center
[chattering]

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.793 position:50% align:center
Question.

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:19.546 position:50% align:center
You mention reinforcements.
Why do you need them?

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:21.297 position:50% align:center
And what happened here?

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:26.302 position:50% align:center
Oh. Well... It was two
weeks ago, at night.

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:29.305 position:50% align:center
[RATRI] We were suddenly
attacked by monsters

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:32.726 position:50% align:center
that shouldn't even be
in the surrounding forests.

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:34.561 position:50% align:center
At first, we were excited.

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:36.229 position:50% align:center
Because, if we beat
such rare monsters,

00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:39.149 position:50% align:center
we could make a fortune
selling their pelts and such.

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:42.736 position:50% align:center
But, there was one
that we just couldn't best.

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:45.321 position:50% align:center
[RATRI]
Every night since,

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.991 position:50% align:center
it's attacked with
a new pack of monsters.

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:49.325 position:50% align:center
Tonight won't be an exception.

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:52.162 position:50% align:center
Ah. And judging by
the state your fort is in,

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:55.290 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you're all
reaching your limit.

00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:57.167 position:50% align:center
[RATRI] And we have
a lot of wounded,

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.461 position:50% align:center
so we can't run and leave them.

00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:01.963 position:50% align:center
Hey, you came by air, right?

00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:04.174 position:50% align:center
Could you do me a big favor?

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:05.508 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
What is it?

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.344 position:50% align:center
[RATRI] I know it's asking
a lot, but I'd like you

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:09.471 position:50% align:center
to take one of our wounded
to the Healer's Union

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:11.598 position:50% align:center
in a nearby village.

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:13.975 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Hm. All right.

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:16.561 position:50% align:center
But before I do, would you
mind letting me see

00:07:16.644 --> 00:07:19.105 position:50% align:center
what condition
this person is in?

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:21.191 position:50% align:center
The other night,
Melissa played decoy

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:23.443 position:50% align:center
to save the others
from monsters.

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:26.112 position:50% align:center
And was badly injured.

00:07:26.196 --> 00:07:29.366 position:50% align:center
Over here. Hey, Dolan.

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:33.119 position:50% align:center
Oh, this must be the young lady
who rode in on the Pegasus.

00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:34.621 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:37.832 position:50% align:center
Even if it's too late, she
should at least be with family.

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:41.419 position:50% align:center
[RATRI] We already tried
using a recovery potion

00:07:41.503 --> 00:07:43.797 position:50% align:center
that Dolan here had,
but as you can see,

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.715 position:50% align:center
I guess it wasn't
strong enough.

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:48.259 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Hm... Interesting
that it had no effect.

00:07:48.343 --> 00:07:52.055 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:53.515 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
As I thought.

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:56.267 position:50% align:center
However, why would that be here?

00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:58.395 position:50% align:center
What? You can tell what's wrong?

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.563 position:50% align:center
Yes, by the looks of it,
she is suffering from

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:02.941 position:50% align:center
what's called maso poisoning.

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:04.984 position:50% align:center
This poison markedly
reduces the effect

00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:07.862 position:50% align:center
of all recovery, not only
from natural healing,

00:08:07.946 --> 00:08:09.531 position:50% align:center
but from medicine as well.

00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:10.949 position:50% align:center
Really? That's horrible.

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:13.159 position:50% align:center
But it's a poison that,
by all accounts,

00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:16.079 position:50% align:center
shouldn't exist
on this continent.

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:19.207 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] First the blizzard
eagle, and now this.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:20.667 position:50% align:center
Damn it!

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.627 position:50% align:center
What are we supposed to do
against something like that?

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.256 position:50% align:center
There's no need to worry.

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:29.050 position:50% align:center
Now that we know the cause,
we can find a solution.

00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:32.429 position:50% align:center
Wait, what do you mean?
It's an incurable poison, right?

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:34.180 position:50% align:center
Well, just watch.

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:41.563 position:50% align:center
From the ring, come forth,
healer of pure white.

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:47.569 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:49.320 position:50% align:center
She has summoning magic.

00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:52.574 position:50% align:center
This one's a dependable doctor.
Just leave it to them.

00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:54.325 position:50% align:center
It's been a while, I know.

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:57.037 position:50% align:center
Sorry to bother you,
but could you help?

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:04.210 position:50% align:center
[RATRI]
Whoa, whoa!

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:05.962 position:50% align:center
If you want her to live,
let it happen.

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:07.213 position:50% align:center
But she's--

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:12.010 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:09:23.438 --> 00:09:25.273 position:50% align:center
Good work, as usual.

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:29.736 position:50% align:center
--What the--?
--[RATRI] Melissa!

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:32.072 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ratri. Uh.

00:09:32.155 --> 00:09:36.201 position:50% align:center
The pain just kinda miraculously
disappeared all at once.

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:38.912 position:50% align:center
I guess that must mean
the end is near.

00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:47.045 position:50% align:center
I can't say I totally
understand what happened,

00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:50.882 position:50% align:center
but when your snake bit her,
it somehow cured her, right?

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:53.802 position:50% align:center
Yes. Not much need to
worry yourself anymore.

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:57.097 position:50% align:center
But she's only been treated for
the poison and her injuries.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.225 position:50% align:center
We didn't replace any
lost blood, or strength.

00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:02.268 position:50% align:center
So make sure she eats
and rests well,

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:04.771 position:50% align:center
and she'll make a full recovery.

00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:07.065 position:50% align:center
Thank you, I-I mean it!

00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:09.901 position:50% align:center
I never knew summoning
magic could do this!

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:13.113 position:50% align:center
Melissa's a very close
friend of mine.

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:15.907 position:50% align:center
Oh, man. I'm so glad.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.868 position:50% align:center
[DOLAN] That's the sacred white
snake Asclepius, right?

00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:20.620 position:50% align:center
This is my first time seeing it,

00:10:20.704 --> 00:10:23.665 position:50% align:center
but good to see summoners
are still going strong.

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:26.042 position:50% align:center
Oh, so you've heard of it then?

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:27.711 position:50% align:center
When you're a hunter
as long as I've been,

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:29.087 position:50% align:center
you learn some things.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.630 position:50% align:center
Like, by your chanting earlier,

00:10:30.714 --> 00:10:33.174 position:50% align:center
I can tell you're an
advanced summoner.

00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:35.218 position:50% align:center
If the world were filled
with people like you,

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:37.804 position:50% align:center
summoners would get
the respect they deserve.

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:43.226 position:50% align:center
Now then, that just leaves
the monsters' leader.

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:45.979 position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea
of where it might be?

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:47.814 position:50% align:center
[DOLAN] At this hour,
it should be making its rounds

00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:50.191 position:50% align:center
in the surrounding forest.

00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:51.860 position:50% align:center
You're gonna go
fight for it, right?

00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:53.403 position:50% align:center
That's what I like to see.

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.113 position:50% align:center
Just tell us how we can help.

00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:56.948 position:50% align:center
Whether is be
as a shield or bait.

00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:58.825 position:50% align:center
All of us here are with you.

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:01.578 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?
We may not be able to win.

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:03.830 position:50% align:center
Hey, we jump at any
chance of victory.

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:06.207 position:50% align:center
That's the secret
to living a long life.

00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:08.835 position:50% align:center
And, we've seen how good
your summoning magic is.

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:10.128 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:11.338 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Well, I don't dislike

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:14.466 position:50% align:center
this sort of turn
of events, but...

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:16.384 position:50% align:center
I don't know. Why not run?

00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:19.846 position:50% align:center
Escaping by air is a guarantee,
even if it's one at a time.

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:22.849 position:50% align:center
If that monster so much
as grazes you, you're out.

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:24.642 position:50% align:center
Take a direct hit,
and you're dead.

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:26.644 position:50% align:center
Even with an amazing
healer on our side,

00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:29.397 position:50% align:center
that's still a fight that
we should be avoiding.

00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:31.816 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I suppose that's
to be expected of youth

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.361 position:50% align:center
who know not of
summoning magic's power.

00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:35.612 position:50% align:center
Nothing I can do.

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:36.988 position:50% align:center
A "healer" eh?

00:11:37.072 --> 00:11:39.949 position:50% align:center
Real summoning magic's
a lot more than just support.

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:42.452 position:50% align:center
You agree. Right, Mira?

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.037 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Naturally.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.248 position:50% align:center
It's greatest strength is that
it can adapt to any situation.

00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:48.750 position:50% align:center
But, the risk...

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:49.918 position:50% align:center
I'm going.

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:51.127 position:50% align:center
[HUNTER 9B]
Ratri?

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.672 position:50% align:center
Did you forget Mira
saved Melissa's life?

00:11:53.755 --> 00:11:55.256 position:50% align:center
If she thinks this
is worth trying,

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.300 position:50% align:center
then I say we give it a shot.

00:11:57.384 --> 00:12:00.553 position:50% align:center
That said, it's not like
I'm looking to die either.

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:03.014 position:50% align:center
We'll need a good
plan of action.

00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:05.558 position:50% align:center
I've got something
in mind you might like.

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:10.021 position:50% align:center
Wh--? Who's this guy?

00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:13.692 position:50% align:center
My holy knight, who will serve
as our primary line of defense.

00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:15.819 position:50% align:center
It can take the brunt
of the monster's attacks,

00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:18.113 position:50% align:center
but it's not optimized
for offense.

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:19.823 position:50% align:center
That part will be
up to you folk.

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:24.035 position:50% align:center
So then, who among you
is brave enough to try?

00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:26.705 position:50% align:center
That summoning magic
is really something!

00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:29.290 position:50% align:center
I think she's worth taking
a chance on, guys.

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:32.377 position:50% align:center
Though, obviously I'm not gonna
be one of the fighters,

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.504 position:50% align:center
so it's up to you to decide!

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:38.299 position:50% align:center
That was the boy making repairs
at a furious pace earlier.

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:41.428 position:50% align:center
If Tomoki says so,
maybe we should do it.

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:44.055 position:50% align:center
Guess we could.
Not like there's no chance.

00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:46.683 position:50% align:center
I mean, we are hunters, right?

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:49.728 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Yes, this is good
for young people.

00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:51.646 position:50% align:center
They'll need to learn to
conquer their fear themselves

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.982 position:50% align:center
if they want to
become truly strong.

00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:55.900 position:50% align:center
They won't grow if
they're forced to fight.

00:12:55.984 --> 00:12:57.902 position:50% align:center
[DOLAN]
Thanks for doing that for them.

00:12:57.986 --> 00:13:00.363 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Oh? I know
not what you mean.

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:02.657 position:50% align:center
This has been a reminder
that the people of this world

00:13:02.741 --> 00:13:07.245 position:50% align:center
really are living their
own full lives now.

00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:08.913 position:50% align:center
All the more reason
to help them,

00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:11.332 position:50% align:center
if it is within
my power to do so.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.887 position:50% align:center
I promise. No matter
what situation

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.348 position:50% align:center
we find ourselves in,
I will protect you all.

00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:27.265 position:50% align:center
[DOLAN]
With this plan,

00:13:27.349 --> 00:13:28.558 position:50% align:center
there's no backing down.

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:30.852 position:50% align:center
Keep your eyes on the
target, or we'll lose.

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:32.979 position:50% align:center
[RATRI]
All right. Let's do this!

00:13:33.063 --> 00:13:35.440 position:50% align:center
[HUNTERS]
Yeah!

00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:37.067 position:50% align:center
[RATRI]
It's straight ahead this way.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.152 position:50% align:center
There's no telling
when they'll notice us.

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:40.904 position:50% align:center
So let's hurry.

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:43.740 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Hmm, not a single bird in sight.

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:47.035 position:50% align:center
With a monster that strong
around, it's no surprise.

00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:49.454 position:50% align:center
I bet they fled a while ago.

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:51.122 position:50% align:center
That makes sense.

00:13:51.206 --> 00:13:54.834 position:50% align:center
[roaring]

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:56.795 position:50% align:center
Stick to the plan
and we can do this.

00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:58.380 position:50% align:center
Let's go.

00:13:58.463 --> 00:14:01.800 position:50% align:center
All right, this area will do.
I'll hold it here for a moment.

00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:03.927 position:50% align:center
The rest of you, go on ahead
and get into position

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.428 position:50% align:center
while we still have time.

00:14:05.512 --> 00:14:06.721 position:50% align:center
[DOLAN]
You'll be okay?

00:14:06.805 --> 00:14:09.057 position:50% align:center
Just who do you think
you're speaking to?

00:14:17.691 --> 00:14:19.192 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:23.029 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
So that's it.

00:14:23.113 --> 00:14:27.283 position:50% align:center
I see. A tyrant spikeback.

00:14:30.453 --> 00:14:33.915 position:50% align:center
I think I'll start by taking
care of his little companions.

00:14:45.969 --> 00:14:50.515 position:50% align:center
What was that loud crash?
Is she really gonna be okay?

00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:52.225 position:50% align:center
[DOLAN]
Listen up! Hear that?

00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:53.935 position:50% align:center
That's the sound of
our white knight,

00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:56.855 position:50% align:center
undefeated, fending off
the monsters' attack!

00:14:58.940 --> 00:14:59.899 position:50% align:center
[DOLAN]
Keep moving!

00:14:59.983 --> 00:15:02.110 position:50% align:center
Our target location's
just ahead!

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:03.570 position:50% align:center
[HUNTERS]
Yeah!

00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:07.866 position:50% align:center
Good, it appears
they're in position.

00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:27.260 position:50% align:center
Okay. From here on out,
we fight for real.

00:15:27.344 --> 00:15:28.178 position:50% align:center
Attack!

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:31.306 position:50% align:center
[HUNTERS yell]

00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:43.651 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:47.906 position:50% align:center
It's so fast! Crazy.

00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:48.823 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Fear not!

00:15:48.907 --> 00:15:50.950 position:50% align:center
I told you I would protect you!

00:15:51.034 --> 00:15:52.744 position:50% align:center
That's right! You saw it!

00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:55.163 position:50% align:center
This is what real
summoning magic is like!

00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:57.082 position:50% align:center
We've got nothing to fear!

00:15:57.165 --> 00:15:58.833 position:50% align:center
Brandish your weapons and fight!

00:15:58.917 --> 00:15:59.876 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:03.213 position:50% align:center
Ready. Dolan's right.
We got this!

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:04.714 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:06.966 position:50% align:center
--[HUNTERS yell]
--[HUNTER 9A] Take this!

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:09.344 position:50% align:center
--Get ready!
--[HUNTER 9AA] You're done!

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:14.933 position:50% align:center
[RATRI]
Pull back!

00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:16.476 position:50% align:center
Evasive action!

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:19.104 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:20.772 position:50% align:center
Advance again!

00:16:32.409 --> 00:16:34.327 position:50% align:center
[VETERAN 9A]
Ah, thanks.

00:16:34.411 --> 00:16:35.370 position:50% align:center
You're a big help.

00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:38.248 position:50% align:center
[HUNTERS yelling]

00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:44.504 position:50% align:center
[DOLAN]
That's it! That's the spirit!

00:16:44.587 --> 00:16:46.006 position:50% align:center
The plan's working!

00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:49.217 position:50% align:center
[RATRI] It's movements
are slowing down!

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.511 position:50% align:center
If we keep at it,
we can do this!

00:16:54.723 --> 00:16:56.558 position:50% align:center
What the hell?

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:09.821 position:50% align:center
Are they done?

00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:16.286 position:50% align:center
Now's the time!

00:17:19.122 --> 00:17:21.750 position:50% align:center
[SPIKEBACK 9A growling]

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:24.961 position:50% align:center
You're mine!

00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:35.388 position:50% align:center
--[HUNTER 9A] Ratri!
--[RATRI] I'm all right.

00:17:35.472 --> 00:17:37.599 position:50% align:center
That should've been
the last of its strength.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.274 position:50% align:center
[HUNTERS cheer]

00:17:46.358 --> 00:17:47.317 position:50% align:center
[HUNTER 9BB]
We did it!

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.152 position:50% align:center
They really pulled through.

00:17:50.362 --> 00:17:51.988 position:50% align:center
[HUNTER 9F]
We really did!

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:59.454 position:50% align:center
[HUNTER 9B] Man, what idiot ever
said summoning magic was weak?

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:01.790 position:50% align:center
[HUNTER 9A] They must've
never seen the real thing.

00:18:01.873 --> 00:18:03.333 position:50% align:center
[HUNTER 9AA]
Yeah, right?

00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:07.045 position:50% align:center
Though, to be fair, I didn't
know until I saw it for myself.

00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:08.380 position:50% align:center
Thanks for this.

00:18:08.463 --> 00:18:10.674 position:50% align:center
We'll be able
to bounce back now.

00:18:10.757 --> 00:18:12.175 position:50% align:center
No thanks necessary.

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:14.135 position:50% align:center
If they weren't up to the
challenge to begin with,

00:18:14.219 --> 00:18:17.931 position:50% align:center
they'd have failed with
or without my help.

00:18:18.014 --> 00:18:19.933 position:50% align:center
They had their spirits broken,

00:18:20.016 --> 00:18:22.686 position:50% align:center
they were able to stand up
and fight once more.

00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:24.062 position:50% align:center
That's something
to be commended.

00:18:24.145 --> 00:18:27.440 position:50% align:center
I see. I guess you're right.

00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:32.529 position:50% align:center
[cheering]

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:38.201 position:50% align:center
[TOMOKI] Hey, I wanted to thank
you for helping everyone out.

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:40.704 position:50% align:center
Oh, please, it was only
because you voiced your support

00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:43.832 position:50% align:center
of my plan that more than
a handful of them even came.

00:18:43.915 --> 00:18:46.835 position:50% align:center
It's clear they all have a lot
of faith in your judgment.

00:18:46.918 --> 00:18:47.961 position:50% align:center
I dunno.

00:18:48.044 --> 00:18:50.463 position:50% align:center
And you're a former
player, too, yes?

00:18:50.547 --> 00:18:53.425 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but I'm a
crafting specialist so,

00:18:53.508 --> 00:18:56.970 position:50% align:center
times like these, I'm
jealous of you fighters.

00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:59.014 position:50% align:center
I'll take this
opportunity to ask.

00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:01.224 position:50% align:center
Before everything turned
real, monsters never

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:03.643 position:50% align:center
appeared outside
their natural habitat.

00:19:03.727 --> 00:19:06.146 position:50% align:center
Has that become an
everyday occurrence now?

00:19:06.229 --> 00:19:07.522 position:50% align:center
Uh-uh. I get the feeling

00:19:07.605 --> 00:19:10.692 position:50% align:center
it only happens with
outside interference.

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:14.237 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] In other words,
human intervention?

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:18.658 position:50% align:center
But then, what could be their
reason for doing such a thing?

00:19:18.742 --> 00:19:20.577 position:50% align:center
[TOMOKI]
No idea.

00:19:25.373 --> 00:19:26.374 position:50% align:center
[FORT 9C]
Mira!

00:19:26.458 --> 00:19:28.626 position:50% align:center
[FORT 9AA]
Thank you! See you again!

00:19:30.712 --> 00:19:32.630 position:50% align:center
Now then, that was
quite the detour,

00:19:32.714 --> 00:19:34.507 position:50% align:center
but lets get back to work!

00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:36.843 position:50% align:center
We're finally approaching
our destination.

00:19:39.971 --> 00:19:43.350 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Elder, there is
something I wish to ask.

00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:45.226 position:50% align:center
Will you not show yourself?

00:19:58.281 --> 00:19:59.949 position:50% align:center
[INDIGO BEARD]
What is it you seek?

00:20:00.033 --> 00:20:01.910 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Apologies for disturbing.

00:20:01.993 --> 00:20:04.120 position:50% align:center
I have come to ask you
if any person has appeared

00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:07.082 position:50% align:center
in search of your roots
in recent memory.

00:20:07.165 --> 00:20:10.794 position:50% align:center
Is there someone that comes to
mind that fits that description?

00:20:14.631 --> 00:20:16.424 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA WOMAN]
I remember a man like that.

00:20:16.508 --> 00:20:18.760 position:50% align:center
Quite frankly,
it was an odd request,

00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:21.179 position:50% align:center
so it was impossible to forget.

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:23.932 position:50% align:center
What I have forgotten
is when it happened,

00:20:24.015 --> 00:20:27.185 position:50% align:center
but he had lovely hair
and wore a mask.

00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:28.853 position:50% align:center
[VINE GIRL]
I remember him, too!

00:20:28.937 --> 00:20:31.356 position:50% align:center
He was the one who brought
lots of tasty creatures

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:33.775 position:50% align:center
for us to eat in
exchange for the roots!

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:35.777 position:50% align:center
I wish he'd come back.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.571 position:50% align:center
[BARK MAN] Yes, as I recall,
he was making a goblet,

00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:42.075 position:50% align:center
and he said he needed
some black thing as well.

00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:46.079 position:50% align:center
Ah, I understand. That's indeed
the man I'm looking for,

00:20:46.162 --> 00:20:48.331 position:50% align:center
of that I have no doubt.

00:20:48.415 --> 00:20:49.666 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes.

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:52.669 position:50% align:center
This is unrelated to my
previous question, but...

00:20:52.752 --> 00:20:54.254 position:50% align:center
In this forest as of late,

00:20:54.337 --> 00:20:56.756 position:50% align:center
nonnative monsters have
been spotted about.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.133 position:50% align:center
Do you know anything?

00:20:58.216 --> 00:21:00.176 position:50% align:center
[BARK MAN]
The particulars are a mystery.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:03.722 position:50% align:center
However, I sense something
warped to the east.

00:21:03.805 --> 00:21:06.099 position:50% align:center
Warped, you say? Huh.

00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:08.685 position:50% align:center
Lord Indigo Beard
of Leafy Shade.

00:21:08.768 --> 00:21:10.687 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful for
the information.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.648 position:50% align:center
I offer you this in exchange.

00:21:13.732 --> 00:21:15.608 position:50% align:center
[VINE GIRL]
Ooh! Human sweets!

00:21:15.692 --> 00:21:17.485 position:50% align:center
[INDIGO BEARD] We have not
had an offering of sweets

00:21:17.569 --> 00:21:18.737 position:50% align:center
in some time.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.739 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I'm most gratified
that you're happy.

00:21:20.822 --> 00:21:23.616 position:50% align:center
There's a lot more where
that came from, so enjoy.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.535 position:50% align:center
[INDIGO BEARD] Mm,
if we're speaking truthfully,

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:27.162 position:50% align:center
I'd have been happy
enough if you simply

00:21:27.245 --> 00:21:29.289 position:50% align:center
urinated a bit right there.

00:21:29.372 --> 00:21:30.957 position:50% align:center
If I what?

00:21:31.041 --> 00:21:33.126 position:50% align:center
[INDIGO BEARD] Considering
the magical power you harbor

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:36.129 position:50% align:center
within you, it should bear
some excellent fruit.

00:21:36.212 --> 00:21:38.381 position:50% align:center
[VINE GIRL] Oh, yeah,
that would've been nice, too.

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:40.925 position:50% align:center
[BARK MAN] It would serve
as fine fertilizer.

00:21:41.009 --> 00:21:42.594 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA WOMAN]
Next time.

00:21:43.595 --> 00:21:45.889 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I've never been happier
to have a box of sweets handy

00:21:45.972 --> 00:21:48.141 position:50% align:center
in my life. I came
this close to being

00:21:48.224 --> 00:21:50.518 position:50% align:center
forced to relieve myself
in front of them!

00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:53.855 position:50% align:center
[MIRA groans]

00:21:53.938 --> 00:21:55.273 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
And now that it's on my mind,

00:21:55.357 --> 00:21:57.734 position:50% align:center
I did have that
apple au lait earlier.

00:21:57.817 --> 00:21:59.402 position:50% align:center
[INDIGO BEARD]
Well, well, well!

00:21:59.486 --> 00:22:00.528 position:50% align:center
[VINE GIRL]
Gotta take a peepee?

00:22:00.612 --> 00:22:02.489 position:50% align:center
[yelps] Did you read
my consciousness?

00:22:02.572 --> 00:22:04.532 position:50% align:center
I know you're gods, but that
doesn't give you permission

00:22:04.616 --> 00:22:06.117 position:50% align:center
to intrude on my psyche!

00:22:06.201 --> 00:22:07.952 position:50% align:center
[BARK MAN] I hear it is
not healthy to hold it in,

00:22:08.036 --> 00:22:09.496 position:50% align:center
child of man.

00:22:09.579 --> 00:22:11.956 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA WOMAN] Come, give us an
offering from your own person.

00:22:14.376 --> 00:22:17.504 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
I don't want to!
