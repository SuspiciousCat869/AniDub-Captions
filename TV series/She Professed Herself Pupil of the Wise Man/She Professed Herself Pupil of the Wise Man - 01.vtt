00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:26.151 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] The VR-MMO-RPG,
<i>Ark Earth Online</i> .

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:30.613 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Complete and total freedom.

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:37.662 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Everything was left
in the hands of the players.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.294 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] While in other games,
the methods to obtain

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:47.756 position:50% align:center
and master skills were
provided to the player,

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.966 position:50% align:center
here, there was no such guide.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.427 position:50% align:center
They were forced to
figure it out on their own.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.804 position:50% align:center
The world grew infinitely,

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:58.224 position:50% align:center
fueled by the player's
limitless ingenuity.

00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:00.894 position:50% align:center
Some chose to study magic.

00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:04.522 position:50% align:center
Some amassed riches.

00:01:04.606 --> 00:01:09.444 position:50% align:center
While others simply honed
their skill of choice.

00:01:09.527 --> 00:01:11.613 position:50% align:center
Countless people
immersed themselves

00:01:11.696 --> 00:01:13.531 position:50% align:center
in <i>Ark Earth Online</i> .

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:18.745 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] And in time,
the players developed

00:01:18.828 --> 00:01:21.414 position:50% align:center
entire kingdoms of their own.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.129 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
But rivalries were inevitable.

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:30.173 position:50% align:center
The players who had
become kings would

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:32.676 position:50% align:center
battle one another, with
the fate of their nations

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.928 position:50% align:center
on the line.

00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:38.431 position:50% align:center
And thus, the Age
of Strife began.

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:44.062 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] At the time, warriors
were the most useful class.

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:45.730 position:50% align:center
They were easy to level up

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:48.650 position:50% align:center
and were reliable in
combat of this nature.

00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:52.278 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Mages, on the other hand,

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:55.532 position:50% align:center
did not fare so well
in the Age of Strife.

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:00.495 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
However, there was one place

00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:03.873 position:50% align:center
that would prove
to be their salvation.

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:08.086 position:50% align:center
The Kingdom of Alcait,
ruled by the paladin, Solomon.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.547 position:50% align:center
The mages, with
nowhere else to go,

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.549 position:50% align:center
flocked to this king's side.

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:15.719 position:50% align:center
And together, they helped
his kingdom thrive.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.554 position:50% align:center
Among the countless mages,

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:22.017 position:50% align:center
there were those who were
exceptionally talented.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.601 position:50% align:center
This group sought to master

00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:26.146 position:50% align:center
the nine different
types of magic.

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:28.690 position:50% align:center
"The Elders."

00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:31.985 position:50% align:center
Known better as
"The Nine Wise Men."

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:56.092 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Though all nine were
formidable, the one King Solomon

00:02:56.176 --> 00:03:00.096 position:50% align:center
trusted most, was
the summoner, Danblf.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.142 position:50% align:center
Also known as "Danblf,
the One-Man Army."

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:57.714 position:50% align:center
[DANBLF]
You summoned me, Your Majesty?

00:04:57.797 --> 00:04:59.174 position:50% align:center
I did, Danblf.

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:02.052 position:50% align:center
I wish to borrow your
strength once more.

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:05.513 position:50% align:center
And whom do we face
on this occasion?

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:08.016 position:50% align:center
Perhaps a giant born of a storm?

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:14.356 position:50% align:center
Or dare I say, an evil god
embraced by heretics?

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.608 position:50% align:center
It's 10,000 monsters.

00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:19.903 position:50% align:center
[COURT gasps, murmurs]

00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:23.990 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] These myriad creatures
have banded together

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:27.285 position:50% align:center
and seek to threaten
my land and my people.

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:30.872 position:50% align:center
[DANBLF] And if I recall, Soul
Howl is defending our boarders,

00:05:30.955 --> 00:05:33.708 position:50% align:center
Luminaria has gone to
reinforce an allied kingdom,

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:37.379 position:50% align:center
and Valentin is off
scouring a labyrinth.

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:40.632 position:50% align:center
Which makes you the
only Elder who can go.

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:42.425 position:50% align:center
Isn't that convenient?

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.637 position:50% align:center
These circumstances are
suspicious, don't you think?

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.138 position:50% align:center
Oh, absolutely.

00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:48.640 position:50% align:center
Someone's behind this.

00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:51.810 position:50% align:center
A rival kingdom, possibly?

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:53.728 position:50% align:center
But regardless, Danblf.

00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:55.939 position:50% align:center
I command you,
in the name of Solomon,

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:57.941 position:50% align:center
strike down Alcait's foes!

00:05:58.024 --> 00:05:59.984 position:50% align:center
Let the world know the
meaning of your moniker,

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:01.528 position:50% align:center
the One-Man Army!

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:04.489 position:50% align:center
Of course! As you wish, my king.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.996 position:50% align:center
Gotta say, that was fun.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.250 position:50% align:center
[DANBLF] Mm. Riveting roleplay,
if I say so myself.

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:16.584 position:50% align:center
And I do.

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:19.421 position:50% align:center
Oh, I took a screenshot.
Care to see?

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:21.089 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
You know it!

00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:26.845 position:50% align:center
Ooh, nice framing.
This kinda shot's exactly

00:06:26.928 --> 00:06:28.930 position:50% align:center
what they'd put on
the back of the box.

00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:30.598 position:50% align:center
I appreciate it.

00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:33.518 position:50% align:center
This is one of my favorite
parts of <i>Ark Earth Online</i> .

00:06:38.023 --> 00:06:40.025 position:50% align:center
Man, there're so many of us!

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:41.818 position:50% align:center
[DANBLF] Just goes to show
how long the two of us

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:43.695 position:50% align:center
have known one another.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.574 position:50% align:center
Hah! Memories.

00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:50.160 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes, the monster
at Lunatic Lake.

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:53.204 position:50% align:center
It was a formidable opponent.

00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:54.664 position:50% align:center
We were all struggling
to keep up

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:57.334 position:50% align:center
with its rampages
every full moon.

00:06:57.417 --> 00:07:00.253 position:50% align:center
It sure was a taxing one.

00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:04.257 position:50% align:center
But in the end, we paid
"Fool the Wunderkammer" a visit,

00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:06.343 position:50% align:center
gathered information
on the monster,

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:09.971 position:50% align:center
and succeeded in subduing it.

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:11.306 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
And, most importantly,

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:14.059 position:50% align:center
founded the Kingdom of Alcait
in the process.

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:16.603 position:50% align:center
Then we lived
happily ever after.

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:18.229 position:50% align:center
We didn't need much brawn.

00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:20.857 position:50% align:center
Because our brains were enough
to complete the quest.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.525 position:50% align:center
Which is another one
of my favorite things

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:24.611 position:50% align:center
about <i>Ark Earth Online</i> .

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:26.780 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I feel ya.

00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:28.198 position:50% align:center
Hey, by the way.

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.867 position:50% align:center
Why do you bother
to pour it into that?

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.453 position:50% align:center
It may just be
a tasteless HP drink,

00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:36.581 position:50% align:center
but I always prefer
the fantasy atmosphere.

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:41.044 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I noticed.
You love your character.

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:42.003 position:50% align:center
You never break.

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:43.797 position:50% align:center
Don't call me a character.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.715 position:50% align:center
While we're inside
<i>Ark Earth Online</i> ,

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:48.551 position:50% align:center
I <i>am</i> Danblf--you know that!

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:51.221 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] You really look like
the quintessential wizard.

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:52.722 position:50% align:center
[DANBLF]
Of course.

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:55.475 position:50% align:center
I modeled Danblf after the two
greatest wizards in media!

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:58.645 position:50% align:center
I watched the hell
out of those movies.

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:00.772 position:50% align:center
And created the ideal me.

00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:02.232 position:50% align:center
This!

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:03.983 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] I just remember
you making me come see like,

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:05.610 position:50% align:center
a third of those with you.

00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:07.070 position:50% align:center
On my own dime, too.

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:08.947 position:50% align:center
[DANBLF]
I bought you popcorn and drinks.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.908 position:50% align:center
The ticket's nothing
compared to that, cheapskate.

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:14.452 position:50% align:center
Y'know, I just don't think
the honorable Danblf

00:08:14.536 --> 00:08:17.163 position:50% align:center
of the Nine Wise Men would
use the word "cheapskate."

00:08:17.247 --> 00:08:19.791 position:50% align:center
Uh-- At any rate.

00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:22.711 position:50% align:center
The point is, I'm Danblf!

00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:25.463 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] So, the horde is
coming from this direction.

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:29.509 position:50% align:center
Could you control 10,000
monsters if you had to?

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:31.886 position:50% align:center
That's too much, even for me.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:35.724 position:50% align:center
I have to imagine someone out
there's created a new spell,

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:39.477 position:50% align:center
or perhaps an entirely new
species of monster is afoot.

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:40.770 position:50% align:center
Who knows?

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:41.813 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
Well, in this world,

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:43.523 position:50% align:center
where there's a will,
there's a way.

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:45.358 position:50% align:center
So we can't rule anything out.

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:48.319 position:50% align:center
This place really is limitless.

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:49.821 position:50% align:center
Don't be silly.

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:52.032 position:50% align:center
No kingdom could possibly
be researching magic

00:08:52.115 --> 00:08:54.159 position:50% align:center
anywhere near as
thoroughly we are.

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:55.285 position:50% align:center
Hey, for all I know,

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:58.204 position:50% align:center
research is easy
and you're just lazy.

00:08:58.288 --> 00:09:00.498 position:50% align:center
[DANBLF]
I assure you, it's not.

00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:02.167 position:50% align:center
What are you plotting, anyway?

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.293 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
Oh, nothing yet.

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:04.961 position:50% align:center
Just an idea.

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:07.213 position:50% align:center
I shall look forward
to hearing about it.

00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:08.089 position:50% align:center
Now, then.

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:09.466 position:50% align:center
Off to fight?

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:10.633 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:12.927 position:50% align:center
You and I founded
this kingdom together.

00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:16.222 position:50% align:center
I will not allow it to
be destroyed so easily.

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:23.521 position:50% align:center
[DANBLF]
Ah, Lythalia.

00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:26.691 position:50% align:center
Master Danblf. Good to see you.

00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:30.111 position:50% align:center
I hear Luminaria is off
on another one of her frenzies.

00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:32.864 position:50% align:center
[LYTHALIA] Yes, she went to
reinforce an allied kingdom

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:34.491 position:50% align:center
with no backup.

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:49.964 position:50% align:center
[LYTHALIA] I'm sure we'll need
to redraw the maps again.

00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:51.216 position:50% align:center
[DANBLF]
That's no surprise.

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:54.469 position:50% align:center
She is Luminaria the
"Natural Disaster."

00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:58.014 position:50% align:center
[DANBLF]
Amalatte.

00:09:58.098 --> 00:09:59.391 position:50% align:center
[AMALATTE]
Master Danblf.

00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:01.935 position:50% align:center
That's another fabulous robe.

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:03.812 position:50% align:center
[DANBLF]
I appreciate the kind words.

00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:06.147 position:50% align:center
I trust Soul Howl
is in good health?

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:09.025 position:50% align:center
Yes, he's just off defending
our southern border.

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:33.842 position:50% align:center
Appropriate for
the "Great Wall."

00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:37.512 position:50% align:center
As long he's on our side,
Alcait will be in good hands.

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:50.567 position:50% align:center
I've returned home.
Hello, Cleos. Marianna.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.570 position:50% align:center
Welcome back, Master Danblf.

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:55.321 position:50% align:center
Yes, welcome back.

00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:56.239 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:58.533 position:50% align:center
Though I won't be staying long.

00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:01.453 position:50% align:center
So continue to watch
the place, won't you?

00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:03.580 position:50% align:center
Yes, leave it to us.

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:04.873 position:50% align:center
Since you're leaving...

00:11:04.956 --> 00:11:06.583 position:50% align:center
Shall I arrange a ride?

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:10.587 position:50% align:center
No, I have got one:
my Floating Island.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.464 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA]
Right. Understood.

00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:14.257 position:50% align:center
Then I'll be on my way.

00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:15.842 position:50% align:center
Yes, Master.

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:17.427 position:50% align:center
We wish you luck.

00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:21.014 position:50% align:center
The two of them are
excellent assistants,

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:24.976 position:50% align:center
but they could certainly stand
to be a little less predictable.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:28.396 position:50% align:center
No. That's asking
too much of NPCs.

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:41.701 position:50% align:center
Let's see.

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:52.087 position:50% align:center
That should about do it.
Then I suppose it's time to go.

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:07.602 position:50% align:center
If you possess wit,
then heed my voice!

00:12:07.686 --> 00:12:11.231 position:50% align:center
Do not dare advance
another step forward.

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:12.774 position:50% align:center
If you so much as twitch,

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:14.651 position:50% align:center
this place becomes your grave.

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:17.904 position:50% align:center
[GOBLINS growling]

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:20.782 position:50% align:center
[DANBLF]
Hm. So you will not listen.

00:12:22.826 --> 00:12:25.829 position:50% align:center
Come forth, my army!

00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:30.166 position:50% align:center
[GOBLINS gasp]

00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:49.686 position:50% align:center
What say we liven the mood?

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:57.193 position:50% align:center
[singing]

00:12:58.695 --> 00:13:00.238 position:50% align:center
[DANBLF]
Forward!

00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:09.414 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:13:37.609 --> 00:13:39.944 position:50% align:center
We're significantly outnumbered.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.160 position:50% align:center
Good move there,
Party Member 1.

00:13:49.371 --> 00:13:51.331 position:50% align:center
[DANBLF]
It's mana, not gunpowder.

00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:53.124 position:50% align:center
The enemy moves
better than expected.

00:13:53.208 --> 00:13:56.127 position:50% align:center
I'm counting on you
to sow confusion.

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.883 position:50% align:center
I'm glad to see
he enjoys his job.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:22.112 position:50% align:center
[DANBLF] For this many
to be cooperating,

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:24.280 position:50% align:center
there must be someone
leading them.

00:14:28.535 --> 00:14:31.830 position:50% align:center
[DANBLF] That one, is it?
You won't escape.

00:14:44.718 --> 00:14:46.469 position:50% align:center
Thank you for the path.

00:15:00.442 --> 00:15:03.737 position:50% align:center
Who ordered this?
Are you going to tell me?

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.822 position:50% align:center
[DEMON 01A grunts]

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:07.782 position:50% align:center
[DANBLF]
It would seem not.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.457 position:50% align:center
[DANBLF grunts]

00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:19.461 position:50% align:center
Did you think
I couldn't fight

00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:21.379 position:50% align:center
because I'm a mage?

00:15:21.463 --> 00:15:23.340 position:50% align:center
That was a mistake.

00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:32.432 position:50% align:center
They cannot be allowed
to escape us.

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:35.852 position:50% align:center
Eisenfald! It's your
turn to play.

00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:40.648 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:46.071 position:50% align:center
Incinerate!

00:16:06.091 --> 00:16:10.428 position:50% align:center
[DANBLF] I am no better
than Luminaria, am I?

00:16:10.512 --> 00:16:14.766 position:50% align:center
No matter. This quest is over.

00:16:14.849 --> 00:16:17.560 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] He summoned and
commanded seven Valkyries

00:16:17.644 --> 00:16:20.563 position:50% align:center
and 1,000 Dark Knights at once.

00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:22.273 position:50% align:center
Thus, his moniker:

00:16:22.357 --> 00:16:25.443 position:50% align:center
Danblf, the "One-Man Army."

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:31.991 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] You did well
to slay the 10,000 monsters.

00:16:32.075 --> 00:16:36.121 position:50% align:center
I was right to send you,
Danblf the One-Man Army.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:43.670 position:50% align:center
As long as we have you here,
our Kingdom of Alcait is safe.

00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:47.716 position:50% align:center
[DANBLF]
All I do, I do for you, My Lord.

00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:49.718 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
A number of days after this,

00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:53.013 position:50% align:center
Danblf suddenly disappeared.

00:16:53.096 --> 00:16:55.140 position:50% align:center
In time, it would
come to be known

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:57.183 position:50% align:center
as the Vanishing of the Elders,

00:16:57.267 --> 00:16:59.644 position:50% align:center
and was the start of
the greatest crisis

00:16:59.728 --> 00:17:02.772 position:50% align:center
the Kingdom of Alcait
had ever faced.

00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:04.524 position:50% align:center
It would also
signal the upheaval

00:17:04.607 --> 00:17:06.818 position:50% align:center
of <i>Ark Earth Online</i> itself.

00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:09.863 position:50% align:center
And soon, everything
would change.

00:22:14.584 --> 00:22:17.587 position:50% align:center
I am... cute.
