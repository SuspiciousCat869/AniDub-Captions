Miss Mira.

00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:44.104 position:50% align:center
Miss Mira!

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:50.068 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Oh, hello, Mariana.

00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:53.029 position:50% align:center
Breakfast is ready for you.

[yawns]

00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:58.201 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] This must've
taken a lot of work.

00:01:58.284 --> 00:01:59.285 position:50% align:center
Not at all!

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.870 position:50% align:center
Besides, you're
Master Danblf's pupil!

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.205 position:50% align:center
It's all my pleasure!

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:04.332 position:50% align:center
Who else will I serve
if it's not you?

00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:06.209 position:50% align:center
You could always
just take time off.

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:07.544 position:50% align:center
No, thanks.

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:12.632 position:50% align:center
[MIRA sighs] I do find it
relaxing to be up here.

00:02:12.716 --> 00:02:17.137 position:50% align:center
Haven't had time for a break
lately. I'll have to savor this.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.015 position:50% align:center
But to be fair,
my last little adventure

00:02:20.098 --> 00:02:22.058 position:50% align:center
did turn out quite nice.

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:26.855 position:50% align:center
Drivin' safely, drivin'...

00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:28.565 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I was on my way
to see Solomon and report in

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:32.902 position:50% align:center
after finishing the
quest at Nebrapolis.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.362 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Oh, oh!

00:02:34.446 --> 00:02:36.489 position:50% align:center
This part of the story is
infinitely more interesting

00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:38.241 position:50% align:center
than what really happened!

[MIRA yelps]
Garrett! What is it this time?

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:49.919 position:50% align:center
[GARRETT] Sorry, Miss Mira,
a cat jumped onto the path.

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.588 position:50% align:center
Just a cat?

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:55.675 position:50% align:center
[meows]

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.385 position:50% align:center
I believe it's a <i>shikigami</i> .

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.889 position:50% align:center
Oh, those familiars
diviners have, huh?

00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:03.767 position:50% align:center
Aw, look how adorable it is.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.310 position:50% align:center
What a pretty kitty!

[WIND SPIRIT 06A]
Excuse me, but what exactly

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:13.109 position:50% align:center
do you think you're doing
with my friend the cat?

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:14.402 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:15.904 position:50% align:center
[WIND SPIRIT 06A]
Let me guess.

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:18.031 position:50% align:center
You're being cruel
like the others?

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:19.282 position:50% align:center
She's a wind spirit.

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:21.034 position:50% align:center
Wait, there's a spirit here?

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:23.787 position:50% align:center
That's right. I suppose
you can't see it.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.790 position:50% align:center
Do you think maybe
we could start over?

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.249 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for worrying you.

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:30.210 position:50% align:center
But this kitten jumped out
in front of our carriage,

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:32.545 position:50% align:center
so we were making
sure it's okay!

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.715 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh, well why
didn't you say so?

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:36.675 position:50% align:center
[BOTH sigh]

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:38.510 position:50% align:center
[meows]

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:43.139 position:50% align:center
So who were the
"others" you mentioned?

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:46.017 position:50% align:center
Humans. They attacked me
by the lakeshore.

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:48.269 position:50% align:center
In my surprise, I fled
through the grove.

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:53.024 position:50% align:center
And when I looked back, I saw
Nyanmaru driving them off.

00:03:53.108 --> 00:03:54.275 position:50% align:center
"Nyanmaru," huh?

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:55.944 position:50% align:center
[meows]

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:57.195 position:50% align:center
I don't suppose
you could tell me

00:03:57.278 --> 00:03:59.197 position:50% align:center
who this Nyanmaru's master is.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.574 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I've never
met them before.

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:09.666 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Curious. This taste
in names is familiar.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:13.920 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] How do you like my robe?
Have I not been reborn?

00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:15.922 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:18.466 position:50% align:center
And I cleared the request
you asked of me.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.177 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] Perfect.
And, uh, that robe suits you.

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:23.304 position:50% align:center
Really.

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:24.389 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Hm?

00:04:24.472 --> 00:04:26.683 position:50% align:center
Anyway, were you
able to talk to Howard

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:28.560 position:50% align:center
through the Mirror of Darkness?

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:31.813 position:50% align:center
No, unsurprisingly, our
bond wasn't strong enough.

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:33.189 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
And Soul Howl?

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:37.736 position:50% align:center
Eh. Although, there were
signs he was there,

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.780 position:50% align:center
and I brought back some things
to look through for any clues.

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:44.284 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
Wow. You're a brave one.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:47.328 position:50% align:center
The man's certainly in for
a surprise when he returns.

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:49.664 position:50% align:center
Indeed. I took all
the research materials

00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:52.334 position:50% align:center
he foolishly left unattended.

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:54.377 position:50% align:center
In an ideal world,
he'd contact us

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:56.713 position:50% align:center
when he finds out to see
if we know anything.

00:04:56.796 --> 00:05:01.384 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I suppose.
There you have it, Suleiman.

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:02.969 position:50% align:center
In order to organize
and decipher

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:05.180 position:50% align:center
this esoteric research,
we'll need someone

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:09.809 position:50% align:center
with a great depth of knowledge
on spirits and antiquity.

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:13.938 position:50% align:center
As such, you're really the
only person I can turn to.

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:15.315 position:50% align:center
Counting on you.

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:19.444 position:50% align:center
Understood, my lord.

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:24.908 position:50% align:center

Now, then.

Welcome back, Miss Mira!

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:35.043 position:50% align:center
You must be tired
from your long trip!

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:36.586 position:50% align:center
Just a little.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.338 position:50% align:center
We're overjoyed you're here.

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:40.965 position:50% align:center
And we are so grateful
to be granted an opportunity

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:44.010 position:50% align:center
to debut the result
of our tireless work.

00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:46.638 position:50% align:center
--Excuse me?

Don't think I don't hear
you laughing, Solomon.

--What have you done this time?
--[LILY] Now.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.062 position:50% align:center
Please come with me.

00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:57.023 position:50% align:center
[MIRA screams]

00:05:57.107 --> 00:06:00.568 position:50% align:center
[LILY] His Majesty informed us
of your particular tastes.

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:02.278 position:50% align:center
And we have done our
best to reflect them

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:05.407 position:50% align:center
in the design of this piece!

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.161 position:50% align:center
Would you look at that reaction?
I just knew you'd love it!

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:11.538 position:50% align:center
I know you're into it.

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:13.665 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] This is so embarrassing
because he's right!

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:16.001 position:50% align:center
And here's the
outfit's user manual.

00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:18.962 position:50% align:center
We'll now excuse ourselves.
Please resume your activities.

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:20.255 position:50% align:center
Withdraw, girls!

00:06:21.256 --> 00:06:23.425 position:50% align:center
So spill, how does it
feel wearing a suit

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:27.303 position:50% align:center
made for you, infused with
cutting edge technomancy?

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:30.682 position:50% align:center
Technomancy, really?
Isn't that a bit fancy?

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:33.435 position:50% align:center
It's fine, don't worry!

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:35.395 position:50% align:center
You always were good
at sweet talking people

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:37.105 position:50% align:center
into doing your work for you.

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:39.190 position:50% align:center
Good to know
nothing has changed.

00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:41.359 position:50% align:center
Suleiman, that poor man.

00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:42.694 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON chuckles]

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:45.321 position:50% align:center
You don't even show any
remorse, you little demon.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:48.033 position:50% align:center
"Little demon."
Oh, I almost forgot!

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:49.993 position:50% align:center
I saw a demon at the
bottom of the catacombs,

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:51.953 position:50% align:center
and a strong one at that!

00:06:52.037 --> 00:06:53.413 position:50% align:center
Hold on, you did?

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:55.999 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. A third-ranked
count appeared suddenly

00:06:56.082 --> 00:07:00.712 position:50% align:center
and attacked me, so naturally,
I made quick work of him.

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:03.089 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
Hm...

00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:06.343 position:50% align:center
You know, I spoke to the
guild union leader in Karanak

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.303 position:50% align:center
and learned some things.

00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:11.306 position:50% align:center
The failure of the barrier
device in the ancient temple.

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.475 position:50% align:center
The zombie trouble in Karanak.

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:17.145 position:50% align:center
And of course, the appearance of
the third-ranked count demon.

00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:22.817 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I find it hard to
believe they aren't related.

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:24.194 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
Hm.

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:27.322 position:50% align:center
However, I don't understand
the demons' objective.

00:07:27.405 --> 00:07:28.615 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
I wonder.

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:31.785 position:50% align:center
[bell rings]

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:33.620 position:50% align:center
Please pardon the intrusion!

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:35.413 position:50% align:center
Why are they here again?

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:39.209 position:50% align:center
[LILY]
We've brought tea and snacks.

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:42.295 position:50% align:center
Oh, is that all it is?

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:43.755 position:50% align:center
[LILY]
Here you go, Miss Mira.

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:45.882 position:50% align:center
Ah yes. Thank you very--

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:52.097 position:50% align:center
Hello?

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.099 position:50% align:center
But before you eat,

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:55.892 position:50% align:center
why don't you come with me?

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:57.936 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
I knew it!

00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:06.111 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON laughs]

00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:08.571 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Very reminiscent
of your preferences.

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:11.157 position:50% align:center
Honestly, why must
ruffles be so itchy?

00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:16.496 position:50% align:center
Deliciousous. Oh, that's right!

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:18.748 position:50% align:center
I have one more thing
that I'd like to discuss.

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:20.000 position:50% align:center
Go ahead.

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:22.085 position:50% align:center
I've heard of at least
one instance of a spirit

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:24.504 position:50% align:center
being attacked lately,
and I'm concerned.

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:26.631 position:50% align:center
On the way here, I met
a spirit who was saved

00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:29.759 position:50% align:center
by an independent <i>shikigami</i>
when such an attack occurred.

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:31.094 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:33.972 position:50% align:center
And that <i>shikigami</i> 's
name is Nyanmaru.

00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:35.807 position:50% align:center
Nyanmaru, eh?

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.685 position:50% align:center
Does anything about
that ring a bell?

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:40.437 position:50% align:center
It makes me think
of a certain diviner

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.149 position:50% align:center
with a terrible naming sense
who uses <i>shikigami</i> .

00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:45.775 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
One of the Nine Wise Men,

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:47.986 position:50% align:center
the Elder of the
Tower of Divination,

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:50.739 position:50% align:center
Kagura of the Seven Stars.

00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:51.865 position:50% align:center
As for the spirits,

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:54.284 position:50% align:center
I've gotten reports
about that, too.

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:55.994 position:50% align:center
We've learned there's
an armed group out there

00:08:56.077 --> 00:08:59.164 position:50% align:center
that's capturing them
for some reason.

00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:03.668 position:50% align:center
Its name is Chimera Clausen.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.341 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Sounds like we need
to investigate them more,

00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:11.176 position:50% align:center
don't you think?

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:12.218 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
Yes.

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:15.221 position:50% align:center
[bell rings]

00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:17.015 position:50% align:center
Please pardon the intrusion!

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:21.144 position:50% align:center
Not again! I'm not
a dress up doll!

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:27.400 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
You really have a penchant

00:09:27.484 --> 00:09:31.237 position:50% align:center
for unnecessary theatrics,
even when it comes to missions.

00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:32.489 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:35.742 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
Ah, yes.

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:37.744 position:50% align:center
You've got a
forbidden area pass.

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:39.245 position:50% align:center
From your mission?

00:09:39.329 --> 00:09:40.663 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:43.750 position:50% align:center
Now, about the Devil's Labyrinth
known as Primal Forest.

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:46.127 position:50% align:center
According to the
guild union leader,

00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:49.339 position:50% align:center
it was deemed a specially
designated forbidden area.

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:51.591 position:50% align:center
The reason being, that
apparently the dungeon's loot

00:09:51.675 --> 00:09:53.843 position:50% align:center
keeps respawning,
and the fighting

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:56.429 position:50% align:center
over the bounty became too much.

00:09:56.513 --> 00:09:58.056 position:50% align:center
Ostensibly, they
wanted to keep people

00:09:58.139 --> 00:09:59.724 position:50% align:center
from killing each other over it.

00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:01.226 position:50% align:center
Hence, the ban.

00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:02.811 position:50% align:center
That's what I've heard, too.

00:10:02.894 --> 00:10:04.437 position:50% align:center
And if, for some reason,
you want a pass

00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:05.814 position:50% align:center
to go in there anyway,

00:10:05.897 --> 00:10:08.650 position:50% align:center
only specially qualified
union leaders can grant it.

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:10.485 position:50% align:center
Though it's kind of
a pain in the neck.

00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:13.238 position:50% align:center
Also, you know that letter
with the dates you gave me?

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:16.199 position:50% align:center
The one with your showy
signature adorning it?

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:18.910 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes, of course!

00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:20.578 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
I asked Cyril, the captain

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:24.874 position:50% align:center
of a guild called Écarlate
Carillon, to investigate for me.

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.501 position:50% align:center
Cyril?

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:29.379 position:50% align:center
Turns out he's a player, too

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:33.717 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] Hm. A lot happened
to you on that quest.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:38.179 position:50% align:center
Thanks for telling me.
I'll call the guild.

00:10:38.263 --> 00:10:39.764 position:50% align:center
I'll spin the demon
story somehow

00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:41.516 position:50% align:center
and do some damage control.

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:42.976 position:50% align:center
In the meantime,
you might as well

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:45.145 position:50% align:center
do some sightseeing
in the castle town.

00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:48.690 position:50% align:center
Actually, why don't you take
a few days off to rest?

00:10:48.773 --> 00:10:51.568 position:50% align:center
This was your first
adventure in 30 years!

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:52.652 position:50% align:center
You may look young now,

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:54.320 position:50% align:center
but you're still
an old man at heart.

00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:57.991 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Aw, shut up!
Seriously, what is your problem?

00:10:58.074 --> 00:10:59.492 position:50% align:center
I'm fine!

00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:09.294 position:50% align:center
[gasps] It's beautiful!

00:11:09.377 --> 00:11:11.796 position:50% align:center
An enchanted notebook!
I was just thinking

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.884 position:50% align:center
that I'd like a secret
memo pad of some sort.

00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:19.220 position:50% align:center
I must say, I'm
surprised at Solomon.

00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:23.391 position:50% align:center
Suggesting I take
time off and all?

00:11:23.475 --> 00:11:25.268 position:50% align:center
Chimera Clausen.

00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:29.064 position:50% align:center
And the Devils' Labyrinth,
Primal Forest. Hm.

00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:30.857 position:50% align:center
[ringing]

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.193 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA] It's a magical
call from Alcait Castle.

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:36.404 position:50% align:center
I'll take it for you.

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:40.575 position:50% align:center
[SULEIMAN] This is Suleiman,
the Alcait Castle aide.

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:42.702 position:50% align:center
Ah, did I hear Suleiman?

00:11:42.786 --> 00:11:44.746 position:50% align:center
It's about deciphering
the research materials

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:46.498 position:50% align:center
we received the other day.

00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:48.500 position:50% align:center
I was able to
make some progress.

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:52.045 position:50% align:center
But unfortunately, a bit
of a problem has arisen.

00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:54.631 position:50% align:center
Might I ask that you
come to Alcait Castle?

00:11:57.717 --> 00:12:00.261 position:50% align:center
Miss Mira has agreed to appear.

00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:03.264 position:50% align:center
[SULEIMAN] Great, we'll send
a carriage for her immediately.

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:06.768 position:50% align:center
All right, I'm off then.

00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:09.270 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA] Have a safe trip,
okay Miss Mira?

00:12:09.354 --> 00:12:10.105 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Thank you.

00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:11.606 position:50% align:center
You work so hard.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.526 position:50% align:center
I surrender my time off.
I'll be back.

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:25.036 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] I'm sorry
to interrupt your vacation.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.871 position:50% align:center
I don't mind much.

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:29.124 position:50% align:center
But what seems
to be the problem?

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:30.625 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] Suleiman is
the brightest this kingdom

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:32.460 position:50% align:center
has to offer, and even
with his knowledge,

00:12:32.544 --> 00:12:36.256 position:50% align:center
he's having trouble
deciphering this.

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:37.382 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
The page on the Holy Grail

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:40.051 position:50% align:center
of Heavenly Light
Soul Howl wants.

00:12:40.135 --> 00:12:42.262 position:50% align:center
Looks like we have a list
of materials needed

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:43.555 position:50% align:center
in order to make it.

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:44.931 position:50% align:center
And it says here
you can get them

00:12:45.015 --> 00:12:47.183 position:50% align:center
in the southern part
of the continent.

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:49.978 position:50% align:center
Well that's not very specific.

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:51.980 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] Yeah, we're
having difficulty pinpointing

00:12:52.063 --> 00:12:53.398 position:50% align:center
the exact location.

00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:55.608 position:50% align:center
But, we have found one lead.

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:57.027 position:50% align:center
And I called you cus I want you

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.195 position:50% align:center
to be in charge
of investigating.

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:00.739 position:50% align:center
Which is to say?

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:02.824 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
"Fool the Wunderkammer."

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:05.285 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Ah, yes. The
depository where the one

00:13:05.368 --> 00:13:07.203 position:50% align:center
known as the
Crescent Moon Emissary

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:09.956 position:50% align:center
stored all their
research and belongings.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.458 position:50% align:center
Brings back memories.

00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:13.960 position:50% align:center
The last time we went there
was when we founded Alcait,

00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:15.086 position:50% align:center
wasn't it?

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:16.463 position:50% align:center
You know it.

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:18.965 position:50% align:center
I have no qualms with going,
but don't forget that

00:13:19.049 --> 00:13:21.718 position:50% align:center
the books there have an
anti-removal spell on them.

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:23.720 position:50% align:center
Good thinking, but we're set.

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:27.182 position:50% align:center
Check it out, this paper copies
what it's pressed against.

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:31.269 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Ooh.

00:13:31.353 --> 00:13:33.980 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] The materials we
need are on the third level.

00:13:34.064 --> 00:13:36.066 position:50% align:center
Uh. Beg your pardon?

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:39.361 position:50% align:center
I swear that dungeon only had
two floors last I checked.

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:41.905 position:50% align:center
I think it has to do with
this world becoming real.

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:44.616 position:50% align:center
Turns out there are a lot
of new areas out there.

00:13:44.699 --> 00:13:46.618 position:50% align:center
You have my attention!

00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:51.706 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] In order to enter the
third level, you need something

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.708 position:50% align:center
called firefly glowstone
that you can get

00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:56.252 position:50% align:center
at the Lugget Copper Mine.

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:57.796 position:50% align:center
I was thinking
of sending Garrett

00:13:57.879 --> 00:14:01.257 position:50% align:center
and his subordinates,
but the army is understaffed.

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:04.302 position:50% align:center
If only we had a capable escort.

00:14:04.386 --> 00:14:05.762 position:50% align:center
Feel me?

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:07.806 position:50% align:center
I swear, every time you
don't have enough manpower,

00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:09.349 position:50% align:center
you immediately
start looking at me!

00:14:09.432 --> 00:14:12.268 position:50% align:center
I am not an unlimited resource
to be used at your leisure!

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:14.771 position:50% align:center
You always were the
perceptive one, weren't you?

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:17.357 position:50% align:center
It's so nice not having
to explain myself.

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:24.906 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] So. Can I
borrow a Dark Knight?

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:27.659 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I suppose it's
okay just this once.

00:14:27.742 --> 00:14:29.452 position:50% align:center
And here we are!

00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:33.581 position:50% align:center
This is the Lugget
Copper Mine, yo! Woo!

00:14:33.665 --> 00:14:35.250 position:50% align:center
[GUARD 06A]
That ride was brutal.

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:36.334 position:50% align:center
[GUARD 06B]
Yup.

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:40.130 position:50% align:center
So that cait-sith.

00:14:40.213 --> 00:14:42.298 position:50% align:center
Did Miss Mira summon
it for us, too?

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:43.508 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:46.052 position:50% align:center
Supposed to be good
at searching for things.

00:14:46.136 --> 00:14:48.304 position:50% align:center
The big boy back
there's kinda scary.

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:51.558 position:50% align:center
He's chill. Just be glad
he's on our side.

00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:54.185 position:50% align:center
Oh. Look, guys!

00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:55.520 position:50% align:center
[GUARD 06A]
Let's do it!

00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:04.237 position:50% align:center
Uh, hey. We sure this is right?

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.573 position:50% align:center
What's with the
existential response?

00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:08.783 position:50% align:center
It should be here!

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.454 position:50% align:center
Whoa, is that it,
Vice Commander?

00:15:12.537 --> 00:15:13.705 position:50% align:center
Yup, sure is!

00:15:13.788 --> 00:15:15.331 position:50% align:center
That was fast!

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:17.167 position:50% align:center
[GARRETT] All right,
let's make this quick.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.960 position:50% align:center
We'll grab what we need
and get out of here!

00:15:19.044 --> 00:15:20.128 position:50% align:center
[GUARDS]
Yes, sir!

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.013 position:50% align:center
Okay, that should
just about do it.

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:31.056 position:50% align:center
We will now return!

00:15:31.139 --> 00:15:32.307 position:50% align:center
[GUARDS]
Yes, sir!

00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:37.604 position:50% align:center
Lucky we didn't run
into any trouble.

00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:41.232 position:50% align:center
Guess our friend the Dark Knight
didn't have to come after all.

00:15:41.316 --> 00:15:44.319 position:50% align:center
Don't get me wrong,
I am not complaining.

00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:47.864 position:50% align:center

Oh, man.

I'm so glad things have finally
settled down in the west.

[LUMINARIA chuckles]

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:45.588 position:50% align:center
Seriously, I was out there
fightin' like crazy again.

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:47.382 position:50% align:center
I worked up a big appetite.

00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:49.759 position:50% align:center
I feel ya, I'm pretty
hungry myself.

00:16:49.843 --> 00:16:53.138 position:50% align:center
Huh? How do you get hungry
just sittin' around all day?

00:16:53.221 --> 00:16:55.140 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
By using my head.

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:56.391 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
No.

00:16:56.474 --> 00:16:57.934 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?

00:16:58.018 --> 00:16:59.436 position:50% align:center
[LUMINARIA]
Hm?

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:00.895 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Not again.

00:17:02.397 --> 00:17:06.234 position:50% align:center
[LEGENDARY BEAST 06A growling]

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:09.029 position:50% align:center
[GARRETT] Listen. You guys
take the firefly glowstones

00:17:09.112 --> 00:17:10.739 position:50% align:center
and get to the armored jeep!

00:17:10.822 --> 00:17:12.574 position:50% align:center
I'll draw that
thing's attention.

00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:13.450 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:14.784 position:50% align:center
Vice Commander!

00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:18.455 position:50% align:center
Just go, that's an order!
Arcus Grage!

00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:21.875 position:50% align:center
It's you versus me!

00:17:23.752 --> 00:17:25.378 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:17:27.756 --> 00:17:30.425 position:50% align:center
[BOTH yelping]

00:17:30.508 --> 00:17:33.094 position:50% align:center
[MEILIN yells]
Shabam!

00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:42.812 position:50% align:center
[MEILIN] I've been looking for
this legendary beast forever!

00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:46.983 position:50% align:center
We can all split the loot, but
I'm takin' it down, got that?

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:48.401 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:50.320 position:50% align:center
[GUARD 06A] Uh. You're not
gonna hear us complaining!

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:52.447 position:50% align:center
Awesome! I appreciate it.

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:57.577 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:02.457 position:50% align:center
Immortal Arts Skill.
Empty Hands. Empty Mind!

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.334 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:13.843 position:50% align:center
Immortal Arts, Movement.
Shrinking Earth!

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.263 position:50% align:center
Wait, Immortal Arts!

00:18:17.347 --> 00:18:19.974 position:50% align:center
I know Mira uses those
when she gets serious.

00:18:20.058 --> 00:18:22.143 position:50% align:center
But I never thought you
could use them like that!

00:18:22.227 --> 00:18:23.978 position:50% align:center
That's nuts!

00:18:24.062 --> 00:18:25.271 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:34.572 position:50% align:center
Not so fast! Immortal Arts.
Earth, Crimson Bouquet!

00:18:38.201 --> 00:18:39.911 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:41.579 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:18:47.502 --> 00:18:50.755 position:50% align:center
[MEILIN] Mm. I heard he was
butt-loads stronger than that.

00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:51.840 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:18:51.923 --> 00:18:53.508 position:50% align:center
Well, you were
"butt-loads" of help!

00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:55.802 position:50% align:center
Hm? What does that mean?

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:58.430 position:50% align:center
[GARRETT] Uh, nothing,
don't worry about it.

00:18:58.513 --> 00:19:00.515 position:50% align:center
I'm just grateful you beat it!

00:19:00.598 --> 00:19:02.350 position:50% align:center
All good, it was no big deal.

00:19:02.434 --> 00:19:04.019 position:50% align:center
Well, anyway, what's
up with the knight?

00:19:04.102 --> 00:19:05.270 position:50% align:center
That dude is glowing.

00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:07.147 position:50% align:center
He's what? Where?

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:10.150 position:50% align:center
Hang on! When did
you even get restored!

00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:11.735 position:50% align:center
He'd make a way
better training partner

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:13.611 position:50% align:center
than that legendary beast.

00:19:13.695 --> 00:19:15.321 position:50% align:center
I'm down to rumble if he is!

00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:16.656 position:50% align:center
[GARRETT]
Uh, wait a sec!

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.284 position:50% align:center
He's kind of our bodyguard
right now, so I dunno.

00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:22.245 position:50% align:center
We probably shouldn't let him
get into a fight for no reason.

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:23.663 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry about that!

00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:25.832 position:50% align:center
Huh? Boo!

00:19:27.542 --> 00:19:30.837 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I guess if you're
not the mage, I understand.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.797 position:50% align:center
You don't want him all wrecked.

00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:34.049 position:50% align:center
[GARRETT]
She figured out the Dark Knight

00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:36.676 position:50% align:center
was summoned right away.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.428 position:50% align:center
If you really wanna
fight him though,

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:40.680 position:50% align:center
maybe you should head
towards Lunatic Lake.

00:19:40.764 --> 00:19:42.432 position:50% align:center
Did you say Lunatic Lake?

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:43.808 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. That's where you'll find

00:19:43.892 --> 00:19:45.352 position:50% align:center
the person who summoned
this Dark Knight,

00:19:45.435 --> 00:19:47.604 position:50% align:center
and maybe they'll let you fight.

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:50.148 position:50% align:center
It's been a while
since I've been there.

00:19:53.443 --> 00:19:55.320 position:50% align:center
[MEILIN] Nah, I'm not
ready to go back yet!

00:19:55.403 --> 00:19:57.155 position:50% align:center
Maybe next time though!

00:20:00.033 --> 00:20:02.077 position:50% align:center
Who the heck was that lady?

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.953 position:50% align:center
The mission's meow complete!

00:20:04.037 --> 00:20:05.163 position:50% align:center
[GUARDS]
Yeah.

00:20:08.291 --> 00:20:09.751 position:50% align:center
[GARRETT, GUARDS]
You can talk?!

00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:15.090 position:50% align:center
Ah, that's much better.

00:20:15.173 --> 00:20:16.800 position:50% align:center
Felt the need to share?

00:20:16.883 --> 00:20:18.885 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
That I did.

00:20:18.968 --> 00:20:21.846 position:50% align:center
This conversation would've
been strange 30 years ago.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:24.766 position:50% align:center
It's strange now, so knock
it off while we're eating.

00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:26.810 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:20:28.019 --> 00:20:30.397 position:50% align:center
[GARRETT]
Our mission was a success!

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.273 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
Oh.

00:20:32.357 --> 00:20:34.317 position:50% align:center
Miss Mira. Thanks
again for lending us

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:36.528 position:50% align:center
a Dark Knight,
it was really reassuring.

00:20:36.611 --> 00:20:39.072 position:50% align:center
Oh, it was no trouble,
it's not worth mentioning.

00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:40.365 position:50% align:center
Speaking of.

00:20:40.448 --> 00:20:43.326 position:50% align:center
The Dark Knight seems
to be rather alert.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.245 position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:20:45.328 --> 00:20:47.622 position:50% align:center
It was attacked by
a legendary beast,

00:20:47.706 --> 00:20:50.041 position:50% align:center
and then a girl using
Immortal Arts saved us.

00:20:50.125 --> 00:20:51.418 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
What kind of girl?

00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:54.212 position:50% align:center
She had hair like this,
lots of energy,

00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:56.423 position:50% align:center
and said stuff like "Shabam."

00:20:56.506 --> 00:20:57.924 position:50% align:center
Did she?

00:20:58.008 --> 00:20:59.426 position:50% align:center
Do you know her?

00:20:59.509 --> 00:21:01.177 position:50% align:center
Yes, it's possible.

00:21:01.261 --> 00:21:02.887 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] Well, if we
need more specifics,

00:21:02.971 --> 00:21:05.473 position:50% align:center
we can always just
check the report later.

00:21:05.557 --> 00:21:07.308 position:50% align:center
You're dismissed.

00:21:07.392 --> 00:21:09.269 position:50% align:center
[GARRETT]
Right. Excuse me.

00:21:11.354 --> 00:21:12.981 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
So, uh. Thoughts?

00:21:13.064 --> 00:21:15.150 position:50% align:center
Ten to one they
encountered Meilin.

00:21:18.028 --> 00:21:20.780 position:50% align:center
She's most likely on one
of her usual training journeys,

00:21:20.864 --> 00:21:22.365 position:50% align:center
but considering
she's in the area,

00:21:22.449 --> 00:21:24.200 position:50% align:center
she could've at
least dropped by.

00:21:24.284 --> 00:21:25.660 position:50% align:center
Sure, but can you blame her?

00:21:25.744 --> 00:21:28.163 position:50% align:center
I mean, she's one of
the Nine Wise Men, too.

00:21:28.246 --> 00:21:33.209 position:50% align:center
And as soon as we came back,
we got put to work by this guy.

00:21:33.293 --> 00:21:36.421 position:50% align:center
This'd be her last training trip
if he had a say in it.

00:21:36.504 --> 00:21:37.839 position:50% align:center
It was for me.

00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:39.049 position:50% align:center
If we're patient,
do you suppose

00:21:39.132 --> 00:21:42.218 position:50% align:center
she'll eventually return
out of the blue?

00:21:42.302 --> 00:21:43.720 position:50% align:center
I doubt it.

00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:46.473 position:50% align:center
She tends to forget everything
but what she's focused on.

00:21:46.556 --> 00:21:49.559 position:50% align:center
Ugh, I wish we had some
more responsible people.

00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:55.482 position:50% align:center
Seriously, I mean they're all
just running around willy nilly.

00:21:55.565 --> 00:21:58.360 position:50% align:center
I wish they'd think of poor us,
saddled with looking for them.

00:21:58.443 --> 00:21:59.694 position:50% align:center
I know, right?

00:21:59.778 --> 00:22:01.946 position:50% align:center
Half the time I'm too busy
to even think straight.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:03.865 position:50% align:center
Like, show some
consideration for your peers!

00:22:03.948 --> 00:22:05.450 position:50% align:center
If only.

00:22:05.533 --> 00:22:08.078 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] Eh. We'll figure out
what to do with Meilin later.

00:22:08.161 --> 00:22:10.663 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Now then. Let's not forget.

00:22:10.747 --> 00:22:12.791 position:50% align:center
The firefly glowstones
are only effective

00:22:12.874 --> 00:22:15.043 position:50% align:center
for a finite amount of time.

00:22:15.126 --> 00:22:17.671 position:50% align:center
Which means...

00:22:17.754 --> 00:22:19.506 position:50% align:center
I should get going.
