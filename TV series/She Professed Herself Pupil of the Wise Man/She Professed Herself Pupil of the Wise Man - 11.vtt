[MIRA]
The Isuzu League, eh?

00:00:16.474 --> 00:00:18.184 position:50% align:center
[WHITE]
Chimera Clausen is after spirits

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:19.936 position:50% align:center
in the southern part
of the continent.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.272 position:50% align:center
We don't have a good grasp
of the specifics.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:24.607 position:50% align:center
but we do know their
numbers aren't small.

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:25.859 position:50% align:center
We don't know even know

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:27.444 position:50% align:center
what they're doing with
the abducted spirits.

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:30.864 position:50% align:center
But, thanks to you, we've got
one of their members now.

00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:33.992 position:50% align:center
Hopefully we'll be able to get
some information out of him.

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:35.785 position:50% align:center
We're grateful.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:38.121 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Considering they're
a group that protects spirits,

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:40.874 position:50% align:center
I'd love to see if they
know about Kagura as well.

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:43.585 position:50% align:center
I'll have to pay them
a visit in the future.

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:45.837 position:50% align:center
Deep in thought again, are ya?

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.631 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Hm? I guess.
It's nothing too important.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:52.010 position:50% align:center
What is, is finding a
place to take a break.

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:57.557 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Ah, caravans.
I should go browse their wares.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.851 position:50% align:center
Perhaps I'll find
a good souvenir.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.272 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL]
Mira.

00:01:06.524 --> 00:01:07.817 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Look who it is!

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.110 position:50% align:center
What brings you here?

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:12.197 position:50% align:center
Mira!

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.532 position:50% align:center
[EMELLA]
Sit down!

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:16.785 position:50% align:center
[CAT-SITH]
Meow! Two! Three!

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:19.287 position:50% align:center
--[boxing bell rings]
--[EMELLA] That'll teach ya.

00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:21.498 position:50% align:center
Good to see nothing's changed.

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:56.760 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL] Well then, here's
to our surprise reunion.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:58.303 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL, EMELLA, FLICKER, MIRA]
Cheers!

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.600 position:50% align:center
The honey au lait
here is perfection!

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:05.894 position:50% align:center
Ah! Just imagining
that sweet liquid

00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:08.188 position:50% align:center
trickling down into Mira's
body is making me--!

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:09.481 position:50% align:center
[EMELLA]
Nope.

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:12.609 position:50% align:center
Escorting a caravan.
That's a classic scenario.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:13.860 position:50% align:center
I know!

00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:16.154 position:50% align:center
Be careful. These escorts
practically always

00:03:16.237 --> 00:03:17.364 position:50% align:center
come under attack.

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:18.656 position:50% align:center
I'm counting on it,

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.867 position:50% align:center
but we don't seem to have
triggered it just yet.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.537 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I see.

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:26.623 position:50% align:center
Are the others in
good health, too?

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:27.999 position:50% align:center
Uh-uh.

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:30.335 position:50% align:center
Asval's over with the second
group, so he's not here.

00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:31.753 position:50% align:center
But Zef is around.

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:32.837 position:50% align:center
What she said.

00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:34.464 position:50% align:center
And Tact is doing
pretty great, too!

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:35.632 position:50% align:center
Since his aptitude test,

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:37.717 position:50% align:center
he started studying
to become a priest.

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:42.097 position:50% align:center
While that is wonderful to hear,
you're getting too close.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.972 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.308 position:50% align:center
Whoa, no way! It's that bunny!

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:46.768 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL]
A pure rabbit, right?

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:47.811 position:50% align:center
Correct.

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:50.021 position:50% align:center
I got lucky and made
friends with it.

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:58.780 position:50% align:center
It's nyan-alcoholic.

00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:01.533 position:50% align:center
By the way, you lot aren't
heading west, are you?

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:03.535 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's our plan.

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:05.870 position:50% align:center
We'll cross the
forest to Osstein.

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:07.122 position:50% align:center
What makes you ask?

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:09.165 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Two things.

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.043 position:50% align:center
First, I recently fought
a tyrant spikeback

00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:13.753 position:50% align:center
in the Child of Prayer Forest.

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:16.923 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL] Hm? But aren't those
only on the Ark Continent?

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:19.342 position:50% align:center
Yes, well, they're
supposed to be.

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:21.886 position:50% align:center
And second, I'm wondering
if you've heard of a group

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.930 position:50% align:center
called Chimera Clausen.

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:27.434 position:50% align:center
Yes, the Union sent us
a quick rundown on them.

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:29.561 position:50% align:center
Saves me the trouble
of explaining.

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:32.355 position:50% align:center
Yesterday, I captured a
member of Chimera Clausen

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:35.066 position:50% align:center
and left him in the hands
of an opposing organization.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.736 position:50% align:center
To be honest, I'm a bit
concerned that his allies

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.071 position:50% align:center
may make an attempt
to rescue him.

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:42.907 position:50% align:center
Even more reason
to stay vigilant then.

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:44.784 position:50% align:center
Thank you for the warning.

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:47.704 position:50% align:center
But I have to say, you certainly
do stick your nose into

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:49.622 position:50% align:center
all kinds of trouble, don't you?

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.875 position:50% align:center
Such is the fate
of an adventurer.

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.293 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL] Well, I wonder
if this adventurer

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:56.171 position:50% align:center
would have an interest
in some new info.

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:57.380 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:24.824 position:50% align:center
Meo... Sleepy.

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.244 position:50% align:center
A ghost ship,
a castle in the sky,

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.038 position:50% align:center
and a golden underground city!

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:32.123 position:50% align:center
That certainly was interesting!

00:05:32.207 --> 00:05:33.625 position:50% align:center
Look at those big eyes sparkling

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:35.251 position:50% align:center
at the thought of
unseen adventures!

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.420 position:50% align:center
I just want to eat you up Mira!

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:38.880 position:50% align:center
[EMELLA]
Denied!

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:41.633 position:50% align:center
Well, Cyril.
Anything else of note?

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:43.426 position:50% align:center
Uh, let me think.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.138 position:50% align:center
Oh! This really is more
of a legend than a rumor,

00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:49.641 position:50% align:center
but have you heard of the
City of the Hero in Black?

00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:51.893 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
No, but that's an unusual name.

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:55.063 position:50% align:center
Agreed. It was about
ten years ago.

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:58.274 position:50% align:center
The Three Great Kingdoms were
locked in the throes of war.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.443 position:50% align:center
A city in the northern
part of the Earth Continent

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:03.405 position:50% align:center
was attacked by
a horde of demons.

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:05.490 position:50% align:center
The city's populace had
no means of resisting

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:07.158 position:50% align:center
such powerful foes,

00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:10.537 position:50% align:center
so they braved the
devastation in silence.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.081 position:50% align:center
That's when it happened.

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:15.667 position:50% align:center
A lone hero suddenly appeared,

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.170 position:50% align:center
and instantly reduced
the demon army to cinders.

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:20.588 position:50% align:center
Or so they say.

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:30.765 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL] There were several
high-ranking demons

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:33.852 position:50% align:center
among the invaders,
some with titles.

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:35.937 position:50% align:center
But they were no match for him.

00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:37.605 position:50% align:center
Without even revealing his name,

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:41.526 position:50% align:center
the hero left the city,
never to be heard from again.

00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:43.361 position:50% align:center
They called him
the Hero in Black,

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:46.322 position:50% align:center
after his choice of clothing,
and changed their town's name

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:48.199 position:50% align:center
to the City of
the Hero in Black.

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:50.869 position:50% align:center
So he only wore black, did he?

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:54.414 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
That is unmistakably Valentin.

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:57.459 position:50% align:center
He's shy, and typically
avoids talking to people.

00:06:57.542 --> 00:06:58.960 position:50% align:center
Though he'll
welcome appreciation,

00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:01.880 position:50% align:center
he cannot accept
gratitude face-to-face.

00:07:02.881 --> 00:07:06.968 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Even among the Wise Men,
he's very socially awkward.

00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:08.136 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:09.387 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL]
Is something the matter?

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:10.388 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:12.724 position:50% align:center
I just remembered
something funny.

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:13.808 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
I'll have to visit this

00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:16.478 position:50% align:center
"City of the Hero
in Black" someday.

00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:19.856 position:50% align:center
Captain! Wait, is that Mira?

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:22.108 position:50% align:center
There you are, Zef. Afternoon.

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:23.693 position:50% align:center
Hey, how you been doin'?

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.862 position:50% align:center
Wait, there's no
time for that now!

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:27.739 position:50% align:center
We need to see
the caravan chief!

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:31.659 position:50% align:center
A unit in the back was
attacked by monsters!

00:07:31.743 --> 00:07:34.329 position:50% align:center
We need to go. Sorry, Mira.

00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:36.122 position:50% align:center
No don't be.
I'll accompany you.

00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:38.249 position:50% align:center
This development is troubling.

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:44.339 position:50% align:center
The rearmost wagon was Unit 8.

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:46.758 position:50% align:center
That unit was guarded
by Noland, correct?

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:48.218 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.512 position:50% align:center
I tried to chase down the
monsters who took the cargo.

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:52.347 position:50% align:center
But there were so
many swarming about,

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.016 position:50% align:center
I had no choice
but to turn back.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.810 position:50% align:center
Weren't our provisions
being transported

00:07:56.893 --> 00:08:00.647 position:50% align:center
by Units 5, 6, and 7?
So why attack Unit 8?

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.524 position:50% align:center
I don't know what
it was carrying.

00:08:02.607 --> 00:08:05.777 position:50% align:center
I think it was basically
pieces of stone.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.655 position:50% align:center
Don't worry Chief,
we'll go after them at once.

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:10.865 position:50% align:center
[CARAVAN CHIEF 11A]
Please do.

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:13.159 position:50% align:center
All right. No time to waste.

00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:15.787 position:50% align:center
By the way, Cyril, who's she?

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.581 position:50% align:center
A very dependable ally,
trust me.

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:29.134 position:50% align:center
Think Noland made that mark?

00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:31.469 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL]
We're on the right track.

00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:33.847 position:50% align:center
[NOLAND screams]

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:41.563 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:44.899 position:50% align:center
[EMELLA]
What?

00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:45.984 position:50% align:center
[ZEF]
When did she even?

00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:48.653 position:50% align:center
[FLICKER]
Mira, you're amazing!

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.073 position:50% align:center
As impressive as ever.

00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:54.200 position:50% align:center
Apologies if I stole that kill.

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:56.494 position:50% align:center
No, no. We're all grateful.

00:08:56.578 --> 00:08:59.706 position:50% align:center
But anyway.
Look at this monster.

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:03.877 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Mm, not usually
seen in these parts.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.253 position:50% align:center
[EMELLA]
There.

00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:07.213 position:50% align:center
[NOLAND]
Thanks guys, you saved me.

00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:10.133 position:50% align:center
Oh, please, we're just
glad you're all right.

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:11.384 position:50% align:center
And the cargo?

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:13.845 position:50% align:center
[NOLAND] They took it
deeper into the woods.

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:15.263 position:50% align:center
I wonder why.

00:09:15.347 --> 00:09:17.182 position:50% align:center
We'll head in after
them ourselves.

00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:19.476 position:50% align:center
I'd like you to go
back to the caravan.

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:21.353 position:50% align:center
I appreciate it.

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:24.439 position:50% align:center
But just know,
these woods are no joke.

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:32.072 position:50% align:center
Noland said the fog gets
worse as you go in,

00:09:32.155 --> 00:09:35.158 position:50% align:center
and more monsters
will attack us, but...

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:37.077 position:50% align:center
[FLICKER] That's not
the only thing happening.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.703 position:50% align:center
[ZEF]
We keep ending up at this spot.

00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:41.122 position:50% align:center
Hard to believe that's
just a coincidence.

00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:42.749 position:50% align:center
We're looping for some reason.

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:47.087 position:50% align:center
And we'd never have noticed
without Noland's marking.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.963 position:50% align:center
Ah, guess we've no choice.

00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:51.508 position:50% align:center
Time to call upon
some specialists.

00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:00.392 position:50% align:center
Oh, cool. What are they?

00:10:00.475 --> 00:10:02.185 position:50% align:center
They're kin to spirits,
and experts

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:05.689 position:50% align:center
when it comes to land
and woods: Koropokkuru.

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:06.981 position:50% align:center
Hi, Village Chief.

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:08.900 position:50% align:center
It's been quite
a long time, it has.

00:10:08.983 --> 00:10:11.444 position:50% align:center
Yo, Village Chief. What up?

00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:13.113 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:14.781 position:50% align:center
[ETENOIR]
Village Chief!

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.034 position:50% align:center
Yes, good day.

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:21.162 position:50% align:center
Uneko, I see you haven't
changed the slightest bit.

00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:22.789 position:50% align:center
[UNEKO]
Nope, nope, nope!

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:24.124 position:50% align:center
But...

00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:26.418 position:50% align:center
Would I be correct in
assuming you are Etenoir?

00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:28.837 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah, of course
it's me, duh!

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.047 position:50% align:center
This is sending me.

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:32.382 position:50% align:center
How do I put this?

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:34.676 position:50% align:center
You seem to have
broken out of your shell!

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:37.512 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but it's not like
it's really that cray-cray.

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:39.806 position:50% align:center
Although, what's going
on with your look?

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:42.267 position:50% align:center
Pretty diff. Got a makeover?

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.686 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Please make no mention of it.

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:47.480 position:50% align:center
[ETENOIR] Look Uneko, you could
totes pull off this style.

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:49.858 position:50% align:center
All frilly and sweet!

00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:52.569 position:50% align:center
[UNEKO] I feel comfortable
in my usual outfit, I feel.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:53.903 position:50% align:center
And besides.

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:55.739 position:50% align:center
It would be disrespectful
to be dressed the same

00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:57.323 position:50% align:center
as the Village Chief, it would.

00:10:57.407 --> 00:11:00.243 position:50% align:center
Huh? Nah, matching
outfits are super cute!

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:02.078 position:50% align:center
You're vibin' with me, right?

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:04.497 position:50% align:center
Uh. Well, I don't
see anything wrong

00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:07.292 position:50% align:center
with wearing the same
outfit as another person.

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:10.378 position:50% align:center
But, I tend to regret
clothing talk.

00:11:10.462 --> 00:11:13.006 position:50% align:center
[EMELLA] Not what I expected
Koropokkurus to be like.

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:14.591 position:50% align:center
[FLICKER]
They're so cute!

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:16.593 position:50% align:center
[ZEF] And pretty different
from each other.

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:18.345 position:50% align:center
So, uh, what now?

00:11:18.428 --> 00:11:19.846 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes, sorry!

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:23.224 position:50% align:center
Uneko. Etenoir.
I have a request for you.

00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:25.101 position:50% align:center
We'll help you in
whatever way we can!

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:26.478 position:50% align:center
R!

00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:27.354 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
R?

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:29.606 position:50% align:center
Yeah, like for "roger that!"

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:33.026 position:50% align:center
Thirty years of slang
evolution is rather frightening.

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:47.957 position:50% align:center
All right ladies. How'd it go?
Learn anything?

00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:53.213 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure why, but we
can't sense any spirits

00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:55.423 position:50% align:center
in these woods at all,
for some reason.

00:11:55.507 --> 00:11:56.841 position:50% align:center
How are the
spirits that maintain

00:11:56.925 --> 00:12:00.720 position:50% align:center
the circulation of mana gone?
Is that even possible?

00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:02.847 position:50% align:center
[ETENOIR]
Deff impossible.

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:06.393 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] There didn't seem
to be any other known groups

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:08.228 position:50% align:center
targeting spirits lately.

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:10.855 position:50% align:center
We hear some areas are
already being badly affected

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:13.024 position:50% align:center
by their absence.

00:12:13.108 --> 00:12:15.193 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] There's little room for
doubt that Chimera Clausen

00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:17.654 position:50% align:center
is behind this anomaly.

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.572 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Now, then.

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:21.449 position:50% align:center
Are we going to fix this?

00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:23.076 position:50% align:center
I don't see any other choice.

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:24.953 position:50% align:center
Not like we could
just turn around now.

00:12:25.036 --> 00:12:27.580 position:50% align:center
Agreed. Let's get this
done together, Mira.

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:31.001 position:50% align:center
None of us wanna
turn a blind eye.

00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:32.836 position:50% align:center
Then we're in agreement.

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:35.588 position:50% align:center
Uneko, Etenoir,
anything helpful?

00:12:35.672 --> 00:12:36.798 position:50% align:center
You bet!

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:39.009 position:50% align:center
We found where the flow
of mana is sluggish.

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:41.886 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and we can make
the trip super easy.

00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:51.354 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Perfect. Let's go.

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:56.234 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Ah, that was a quick jaunt.

00:12:57.569 --> 00:13:00.989 position:50% align:center
[LIONS growling]

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:01.865 position:50% align:center
This is it.

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:03.575 position:50% align:center
Hold on a second!

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:06.119 position:50% align:center
[ZEF] There are way
too many monsters here!

00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:10.874 position:50% align:center
I think I can make out
the cargo over there.

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:15.337 position:50% align:center
But if those are
what I think they are...

00:13:17.714 --> 00:13:20.633 position:50% align:center
It's the Ash Silver Lion
and the Golden Lion.

00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:23.887 position:50% align:center
It's always a surprise
to run into a legendary beast.

00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:28.767 position:50% align:center
Which one do you want?

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.894 position:50% align:center
I believe I'll take
the Golden Lion.

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:33.646 position:50% align:center
Fair enough, then the
silver one is mine.

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:39.778 position:50% align:center
[ZEF] Man, those two
are just going for it.

00:13:39.861 --> 00:13:42.238 position:50% align:center
[EMELLA sighs]
How in character.

00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:45.408 position:50% align:center
[FLICKER] That leaves us
with the grunts, then.

00:13:45.492 --> 00:13:46.409 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL]
Ready?

00:13:46.493 --> 00:13:48.036 position:50% align:center
Of course I am.

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:18.024 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.533 position:50% align:center
Ooh, feisty.

00:14:26.616 --> 00:14:28.076 position:50% align:center
This one's quite energetic.

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:30.036 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.496 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I'm impressed
these shields can repel

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:33.540 position:50% align:center
a legendary beast's attack.

00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:37.961 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:46.094 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:52.851 position:50% align:center
This is the end.

00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:01.901 position:50% align:center
Not bad, I suppose.

00:15:01.985 --> 00:15:03.528 position:50% align:center
I'm beginning to get
used to juggling

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:06.239 position:50% align:center
partial summons and
immortal art spells.

00:15:07.741 --> 00:15:09.075 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL yells]

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.374 position:50% align:center
There.

00:15:16.458 --> 00:15:18.418 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Brilliantly done.

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:21.212 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL] Thanks, but it
could've been better.

00:15:21.296 --> 00:15:24.549 position:50% align:center
All right, how are they?

00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:25.967 position:50% align:center
[ZEF grunting]

00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:27.427 position:50% align:center
[EMELLA grunts]

00:15:30.722 --> 00:15:32.223 position:50% align:center
[FLICKER yells]

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:36.144 position:50% align:center
I'll help.

00:15:36.227 --> 00:15:38.563 position:50% align:center
Think you could keep it
to the absolute minimum?

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:40.148 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Are you sure?

00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:44.444 position:50% align:center
Yeah. They need the practice.
I want them to grow stronger.

00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:53.203 position:50% align:center
Great minds think
alike, it appears.

00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:54.454 position:50% align:center
Roger that.

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:00.585 position:50% align:center
You've got this!

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:23.608 position:50% align:center
Could this be part of the cargo?

00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:28.279 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Why were they after
something like this?

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.284 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Oh. This pattern looks similar

00:16:33.368 --> 00:16:35.537 position:50% align:center
to the Demon's Blessing, but...

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:39.290 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.427 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Where am I?

00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:56.057 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Might I trouble
you for a moment?

00:16:56.141 --> 00:16:58.852 position:50% align:center
Oh, my, an unexpected visitor.

00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:02.188 position:50% align:center
Yes. What is it that you
would like to speak about?

00:17:02.272 --> 00:17:03.440 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:05.984 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Everyone who
comes to this era

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:08.194 position:50% align:center
gets that same
look on their face.

00:17:08.278 --> 00:17:10.697 position:50% align:center
My apologies, I feel a bit...

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.198 position:50% align:center
[WHITE HOOD]
Like your senses are dulled?

00:17:12.282 --> 00:17:13.533 position:50% align:center
What, you can tell?

00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:15.118 position:50% align:center
[WHITE HOOD]
In a manner of speaking.

00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:16.870 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
You said "this era."

00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:19.289 position:50% align:center
Could you explain to me
what you meant by that?

00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:20.915 position:50% align:center
[WHITE HOOD]
Of course.

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:25.545 position:50% align:center
A past era?

00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:27.130 position:50% align:center
[WHITE HOOD]
Yes. You were caught

00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:29.716 position:50% align:center
in a space-time distortion
and only your soul

00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:31.468 position:50% align:center
traveled into the past.

00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:33.303 position:50% align:center
Though, there's no
reason to worry.

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:35.847 position:50% align:center
You'll be going back
after a little while.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:36.973 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:17:37.057 --> 00:17:38.475 position:50% align:center
However, I believe
there must have been

00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:40.518 position:50% align:center
a catalyst for
your arrival here.

00:17:40.602 --> 00:17:41.853 position:50% align:center
Anything come to mind?

00:17:41.936 --> 00:17:43.563 position:50% align:center
Um, perhaps.

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:49.611 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I touched an odd
stone tablet in a forest

00:17:49.694 --> 00:17:52.655 position:50% align:center
with stagnant mana.
That must've been it.

00:17:52.739 --> 00:17:54.366 position:50% align:center
[WHITE HOOD]
Ah, I see.

00:17:54.449 --> 00:17:57.077 position:50% align:center
The distortion in the mana
interfered with space-time

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.496 position:50% align:center
and wrinkled it, so to speak.

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.247 position:50% align:center
And that stone tablet
must have served

00:18:01.331 --> 00:18:03.875 position:50% align:center
as your guide to
this point in time.

00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:07.128 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I didn't realize mana
could do something like this.

00:18:07.212 --> 00:18:10.173 position:50% align:center
[WHITE HOOD]
Mana is both zero and one.

00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:11.966 position:50% align:center
It's also the pillar
that ensures

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.260 position:50% align:center
that space remains space.

00:18:14.344 --> 00:18:17.597 position:50% align:center
Among our people,
mana is a sacred truth.

00:18:17.681 --> 00:18:22.018 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Both zero and one, eh?
An interesting proposition.

00:18:22.102 --> 00:18:24.187 position:50% align:center
[WHITE HOOD] There's something
that bothers me a little.

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.481 position:50% align:center
A mana distortion
great enough to interfere

00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:28.149 position:50% align:center
with space-time is rare.

00:18:28.233 --> 00:18:30.276 position:50% align:center
I hope this will be
the end of it, but...

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.779 position:50% align:center
You think something more
could happen, yes?

00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:36.408 position:50% align:center
I believe it's possible.
It may, or it may not.

00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:39.411 position:50% align:center
Then I'll take that
as a warning.

00:18:39.494 --> 00:18:41.871 position:50% align:center
You're ostensibly
very knowledgeable,

00:18:41.955 --> 00:18:44.624 position:50% align:center
but who, might I ask,
are you people?

00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:48.795 position:50% align:center
If you must know,
we are the Devils.

00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:50.422 position:50% align:center
Devils, you say?

00:18:50.505 --> 00:18:52.757 position:50% align:center
It sounds as though
you've heard of us.

00:18:52.841 --> 00:18:54.342 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Not exactly.

00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:57.804 position:50% align:center
In our era, the only "Devils"
are the "Devil's Labyrinths."

00:18:57.887 --> 00:19:01.349 position:50% align:center
Really? There are Labyrinths
that bear our name, you say?

00:19:01.433 --> 00:19:03.685 position:50% align:center
They sound interesting.

00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:05.770 position:50% align:center
To be honest, I wouldn't
consider it an honor

00:19:05.854 --> 00:19:07.605 position:50% align:center
to be associated with them.

00:19:07.689 --> 00:19:08.815 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:08.898 --> 00:19:11.192 position:50% align:center
[WHITE HOOD] Ah, I see
you can go back now.

00:19:11.276 --> 00:19:12.736 position:50% align:center
That was quick.

00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:14.362 position:50% align:center
[WHITE HOOD] I would've
liked to talk to you more,

00:19:14.446 --> 00:19:17.198 position:50% align:center
but I feel like we'll
meet again, so it's okay.

00:19:17.282 --> 00:19:18.700 position:50% align:center
What's that supposed to mean?

00:19:18.783 --> 00:19:20.076 position:50% align:center
Hang on.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.164 position:50% align:center
Before I go, I must ask,
where are you people headed?

00:19:24.247 --> 00:19:26.166 position:50% align:center
[WHITE HOOD]
The Reincarnation Gate.

00:19:26.249 --> 00:19:29.127 position:50% align:center
We're going to be reborn
as a new species.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:32.088 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Do you know
what you'll turn into?

00:19:32.172 --> 00:19:33.381 position:50% align:center
[WHITE HOOD]
Angels.

00:19:33.465 --> 00:19:35.050 position:50% align:center
Angels?

00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:38.970 position:50% align:center
Then, that black gate is...

00:19:41.264 --> 00:19:42.682 position:50% align:center
[WHITE HOOD]
It's...

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:47.854 position:50% align:center
What's the matter? You okay?

00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:49.731 position:50% align:center
What? Uh. Yes.

00:19:49.814 --> 00:19:51.358 position:50% align:center
I'm perfectly fine.

00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:53.610 position:50% align:center
We got rid of the
monster corpses.

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:55.737 position:50% align:center
Let's retrieve the
cargo and head back.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.197 position:50% align:center
Yes, let's.

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:05.663 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Why do I feel like
I was talking to someone?

00:20:07.457 --> 00:20:09.709 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Was it just my imagination?

00:20:25.934 --> 00:20:27.602 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL]
Be careful on your travels.

00:20:27.686 --> 00:20:29.896 position:50% align:center
[EMELLA]
Until next time, Mira.

00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:32.774 position:50% align:center
Don't stick your nose into
anything too dangerous.

00:20:32.857 --> 00:20:36.945 position:50% align:center
I haven't gotten
enough Mira time!

00:20:37.028 --> 00:20:38.947 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Cyril. Emella.

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.658 position:50% align:center
Zef. And Flicker.

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:44.035 position:50% align:center
I wish you all the best
on your travels.

00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:06.349 position:50% align:center
Huh? Light?

00:21:13.023 --> 00:21:14.315 position:50% align:center
What in the world is this?

00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:17.569 position:50% align:center
[tires screeching]

00:21:17.652 --> 00:21:19.529 position:50% align:center
Garret?

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:20.822 position:50% align:center
[GARRETT]
Miss Mira.

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:23.074 position:50% align:center
There you are.
Fill me in, will you?

00:21:23.158 --> 00:21:24.451 position:50% align:center
Monsters attacked.

00:21:24.534 --> 00:21:25.702 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:28.204 position:50% align:center
A horde, it just appeared
out of nowhere.

00:21:28.288 --> 00:21:30.457 position:50% align:center
And it's bigger
than any we've seen.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:31.750 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:37.756 --> 00:21:40.133 position:50% align:center
[GARRETT] I busted through
them in hopes of finding you.

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:43.428 position:50% align:center
I had to tell you
what was happening.

00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:45.847 position:50% align:center
But for now, you should
meet up with King Solomon

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.474 position:50% align:center
as soon as possible.

00:21:48.767 --> 00:21:50.393 position:50% align:center
[WHITE HOOD]
A mana distortion great enough

00:21:50.477 --> 00:21:53.021 position:50% align:center
to interfere with
space-time is rare.

00:21:53.104 --> 00:21:55.648 position:50% align:center
I hope this will be
the end of it, but...

00:21:55.732 --> 00:21:57.067 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:21:59.861 --> 00:22:01.279 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
However...

00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:05.867 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:22:16.294 --> 00:22:18.088 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I don't think he'd
mind if I cleaned up

00:22:18.171 --> 00:22:19.839 position:50% align:center
here and there on the way.
