We're not far off now.
The Primal Forest is close.

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:21.813 position:50% align:center
As I recall,
the entrance should be

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:24.399 position:50% align:center
at the lake near
the sacred grounds.

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:27.652 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:45.086 position:50% align:center
Was this place always
so flowery and pristine?

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.591 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Whoa!

00:00:49.674 --> 00:00:53.136 position:50% align:center
Ah, right. Pegasus is
a sacred beast.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.305 position:50% align:center
The space near one
such creature is essentially

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:57.724 position:50% align:center
a sanctuary for small animals.

00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:04.064 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Ah! Is that a small
blue rabbit I see?

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:06.483 position:50% align:center
Indeed, it's a "pure rabbit"!

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:11.196 position:50% align:center
Even I have never encountered
one of them before!

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:12.822 position:50% align:center
They always took the
top spot in the in-game

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:16.451 position:50% align:center
cuteness rankings, too!
This is unbelievable!

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:19.496 position:50% align:center
To think! One's right
in front of me!

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:23.208 position:50% align:center
Yep, I should have
seen that coming.

[PEGASUS whinnies]

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:29.589 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:32.842 position:50% align:center
Could it be you spoke
to it and praised me?

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:36.262 position:50% align:center
Aw, you are so good!

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:40.809 position:50% align:center
[giggles] Hello! You are
such a fussy little thing.

00:01:40.892 --> 00:01:43.603 position:50% align:center

[whinnies]

00:01:50.568 --> 00:01:52.987 position:50% align:center
And what did you
say to it this time?

00:01:54.572 --> 00:01:57.117 position:50% align:center
Now then, as entertaining
as this has been,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.662 position:50% align:center
I cannot stay here playing
with animals forever.

00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:02.497 position:50% align:center
I'm on an errand for
Solomon and must now

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.749 position:50% align:center
go find seeds of
the progenitors,

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:06.918 position:50% align:center
so I'll have to cut
this playdate short.

00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:09.129 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid this is goodbye.

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:11.673 position:50% align:center
Thank you for all
your hard work, Pegasus.

00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:13.299 position:50% align:center
I'll call on you again.

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:27.522 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:30.608 position:50% align:center
Do you all think of me as
Pegasus's superior or something?

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:32.235 position:50% align:center
Well, you're mistaken.

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:34.070 position:50% align:center
It would not be
smart to follow me.

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.698 position:50% align:center
Where I'm going
is very dangerous.

00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:38.825 position:50% align:center
So do not trail me.

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:47.625 position:50% align:center
You leave me no choice,
let me fetch a negotiator.

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:05.185 position:50% align:center
You call and I shall
appear, Myeow Lady!

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:07.354 position:50% align:center
I tried sprucing up
my intro this tyime.

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:10.065 position:50% align:center
What do you think you'd
rate it out of a 10?

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:11.566 position:50% align:center
Six points, I would say.

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:13.526 position:50% align:center
Your tail was ever
so slightly quivery.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.195 position:50% align:center
Meow, that's harsh!

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:17.947 position:50% align:center
Anyway, what can I do
for you this time around?

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.200 position:50% align:center
Well. I want you
to tell these animals

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:21.743 position:50% align:center
to stop following me.

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:23.995 position:50% align:center
I'm heading into
dangerous territory.

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.747 position:50% align:center
[CAIT-SITH]
Meow, yes, sir!

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:31.711 position:50% align:center

00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:33.088 position:50% align:center
Thank you, good work.

00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:35.340 position:50% align:center
So, uh, mind if I accompany you?

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:37.592 position:50% align:center
Not at all. Come along then.

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:40.220 position:50% align:center
[CAIT-SITH]
We're off, meow!

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:20.653 position:50% align:center

my Cat Search Light!

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:22.113 position:50% align:center
Ooh!

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:31.831 position:50% align:center
[CAIT-SITH]
That looks suspicious.

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:35.543 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Hm. Yes, it's
the barrier, I take it.

00:05:35.627 --> 00:05:38.088 position:50% align:center
Then this is where our
pass comes in handy.

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:49.391 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] So that's how it
grants the holder passage.

[CAIT-SITH]
Party Leader!

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:58.066 position:50% align:center

an unexplored area!

Nya-hoo!

00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:01.194 position:50% align:center
I think you've
taken me far enough.

00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:02.362 position:50% align:center
Meow?

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:14.958 position:50% align:center

I'm not getting
rid of you, am I?

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:19.254 position:50% align:center
That's my smart Party Leader!

00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:21.506 position:50% align:center
I'll stalk you for
the rest of my life!

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:23.508 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I believe it goes
"I will <i>follow</i> you

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:27.470 position:50% align:center
for the rest of my life."
Either way, ready to go?

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:31.057 position:50% align:center
[CAIT-SITH]
It's pitch black in here.

It's a nyew world!

00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:14.517 position:50% align:center
We've discovered
an even secreter place

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:16.227 position:50% align:center
within the secret place!

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.650 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Let's hope we can find as
many of these seeds as we need.

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:28.365 position:50% align:center
Watch your step meow,
we wouldn't want you to fall!

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:29.616 position:50% align:center

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.285 position:50% align:center

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:34.537 position:50% align:center
A little help?

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:38.458 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Grab my hand!

00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:41.378 position:50% align:center
Adventure, meow!

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:46.591 position:50% align:center
Ah! That was a close call,
huh, Party Leader?

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:48.218 position:50% align:center
For you, yes.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.854 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
At long last, we found one.

00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:02.607 position:50% align:center
Remind me, how many more
do you need again?

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:04.025 position:50% align:center
That would be nine.

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:06.861 position:50% align:center
This is going to be
quite arduous.

00:08:06.945 --> 00:08:10.615 position:50% align:center

We're gonna need a pig!

Oink, oink, oink.

My nyose says that way!

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:15.829 position:50% align:center
I don't know which
is more confusing,

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:17.038 position:50% align:center
that you're a truffle
hog or that you

00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:19.332 position:50% align:center
never tried your cat nose.

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:33.805 position:50% align:center
Very good work.
Just half to go now.

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:36.975 position:50% align:center
We may actually finish
earlier than planned.

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:39.060 position:50% align:center
Danger, meow!

00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:42.147 position:50% align:center
[gasps] So they've appeared.

00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:48.945 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I'll ask you to hide
for a few moments.

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:50.196 position:50% align:center
[CAIT-SITH]
Roger that!

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.364 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Wha--hey!

00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:53.700 position:50% align:center
Do not stiffen your tail!
That tickles!

[MIRA] Immortal Arts, Earth:
Crimson Bouquet!

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:23.646 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I thought I'd save
my dark and holy knights

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.483 position:50% align:center
some time and do a partial
summon of their weapons.

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:27.984 position:50% align:center
Impressive, no?

00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:30.111 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but I expect it from you.

00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:34.491 position:50% align:center
Got us some stuff!

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:37.827 position:50% align:center
I wasn't aware you could
collect loot for me.

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:40.246 position:50% align:center
[CAIT-SITH] Meow, back to
our original mission!

00:09:41.873 --> 00:09:43.667 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
That makes ten.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.710 position:50% align:center
We've retrieved what
we came here for.

00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:47.754 position:50% align:center
I think it's time
to head home now.

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:49.255 position:50% align:center
Good plan!

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:52.092 position:50% align:center
If I recall correctly,
when I came here last time,

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:55.553 position:50% align:center
there was a trail of blue
flowers that led to the exit.

00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:58.848 position:50% align:center
Well, Party Member 1,
can you spot them anywhere?

00:10:01.393 --> 00:10:02.519 position:50% align:center
[CAIT-SITH]
Found 'em!

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:04.437 position:50% align:center
Nicely done!

00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:06.981 position:50% align:center
We can follow this
path to the exit.

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:11.820 position:50% align:center
[CAIT-SITH]
Meow!

00:10:11.903 --> 00:10:13.905 position:50% align:center
Look, there's something
in that tree!

00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:15.907 position:50% align:center
Yes. Looks like
a treasure chest.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.785 position:50% align:center
Tempting, eh?

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:20.286 position:50% align:center
Let's see.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:24.207 position:50% align:center
The Guild Union leader
of Karanak spoke of this.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.501 position:50% align:center
This was designated
a forbidden area because

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:28.044 position:50% align:center
its treasure kept respawning

00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:30.672 position:50% align:center
and the fighting over it
became intolerable.

00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:32.841 position:50% align:center
That's why we needed
my pass to get in.

00:10:32.924 --> 00:10:34.759 position:50% align:center
Which likely means good loot.

00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:38.722 position:50% align:center
Immortal Arts.

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:40.432 position:50% align:center
Heaven: Shock Wave!

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:45.311 position:50% align:center
That was myasterful,
Party Leader!

00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:47.147 position:50% align:center
I wonder if the
contents of this chest

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.315 position:50% align:center
will be actual
treasure or monsters.

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:52.152 position:50% align:center
With me around, there's no
need to do any guesswork!

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:56.322 position:50% align:center
There's no tricks in this one!

00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:58.950 position:50% align:center
You're really surprising me
with your abilities today.

00:10:59.034 --> 00:11:01.870 position:50% align:center
With 30 years of training,
you pick up a few things!

00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:06.791 position:50% align:center
Meow, meow?

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:09.502 position:50% align:center
Hold on!

00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:12.088 position:50% align:center
I think this is a piece
of the World Tree!

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:14.257 position:50% align:center
That's certainly
an unusual find.

00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:16.843 position:50% align:center
I'd wager Luminaria'd like this.

00:11:33.443 --> 00:11:35.028 position:50% align:center
Whoa, it talked!

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:37.155 position:50% align:center
We wish to exit this place.

00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:39.449 position:50% align:center
[GUIDE 10A] Ah, I see.
Then I should be able

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:42.369 position:50% align:center
to help you if you can
fulfil one condition.

00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:43.828 position:50% align:center
Bring me the source of strength

00:11:43.912 --> 00:11:46.873 position:50% align:center
and I shall deliver you
to the surface.

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:49.876 position:50% align:center
Ah! I see you already
have it on you.

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:51.670 position:50% align:center
You mean this?

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:54.297 position:50% align:center
[GUIDE 10A]
Yes, now toss it into the lake.

00:11:54.381 --> 00:11:59.177 position:50% align:center
Do so, and I shall
escort you to the exit.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.179 position:50% align:center
Your contribution is confirmed.

00:12:01.262 --> 00:12:02.681 position:50% align:center
Here we go.

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:05.600 position:50% align:center
What's going on meow?

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:07.435 position:50% align:center
You're safe, no need to worry.

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:10.689 position:50% align:center
We're merely being taken
to the exit, like they said.

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:13.400 position:50% align:center
[CAIT-SITH]
Meow! Meow, meow, meow!

00:12:13.483 --> 00:12:15.860 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Hey! Don't tug on that!

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:31.876 position:50% align:center
[MIRA screaming]

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:37.590 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Couldn't you have
been a bit gentler?

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:39.509 position:50% align:center
[GUIDE 10A] Follow that river
and you will emerge outside.

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:40.802 position:50% align:center
Fare thee well!

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:44.431 position:50% align:center
Meow. They're a bit
eccentric, huh?

00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:46.933 position:50% align:center
Don't know what I
expected from a flower.

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:54.524 position:50% align:center
Okay! All that remains now,
is to go downstream.

00:12:58.194 --> 00:13:00.321 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Ready to do this,
Party Member 1?

00:13:00.405 --> 00:13:02.282 position:50% align:center
I'd go to the ends of the Earth!

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:11.207 position:50% align:center
Meow! Check it out!
We're going crazy fast!

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:13.001 position:50% align:center
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow!

00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:15.545 position:50% align:center
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow!

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:19.049 position:50% align:center
Meow!

00:13:30.894 --> 00:13:32.479 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Here's a towel.

00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:33.730 position:50% align:center
[CAIT-SITH]
Meow.

00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:48.703 position:50% align:center
I know you're there,
show yourself!

00:13:50.622 --> 00:13:53.958 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
You're not a spirit?

00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:55.502 position:50% align:center
A spirit, you say?

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:58.838 position:50% align:center
Of course she's nyot a spirit!
She's my Party Leader, duh!

00:13:58.922 --> 00:14:00.715 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Is that a cait-sith?

00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:03.593 position:50% align:center
Yes. So as you may have
guessed, I'm a summoner.

00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:05.261 position:50% align:center
That's right! And not
just any summoner,

00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:07.764 position:50% align:center
she's more powerful than
you can possibly imagine!

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:10.600 position:50% align:center
Now show some respect!

00:14:10.684 --> 00:14:12.894 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
I see. You looked so beautiful

00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:15.980 position:50% align:center
as a spirit, so I
mistook you for one.

00:14:16.064 --> 00:14:19.859 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Ah, is that so? Interesting.

00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:23.196 position:50% align:center
If you indeed mistook me
for a spirit then I wonder,

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:24.698 position:50% align:center
why were you so wary?

00:14:24.781 --> 00:14:26.366 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Eh, you know.

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:28.076 position:50% align:center
One time I accidentally
wandered into

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:30.286 position:50% align:center
the wrong spirit's territory.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.455 position:50% align:center
Wound up getting
chased around, so,

00:14:32.539 --> 00:14:35.250 position:50% align:center
not on my top list
of things to do again.

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:37.127 position:50% align:center
Ah. How unfortunate.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.254 position:50% align:center
I can't blame you, in that case.

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:40.755 position:50% align:center
Meow that's what
I call careless.

00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:43.133 position:50% align:center
Hey. Why don't you keep
quiet for a little while?

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:46.636 position:50% align:center
Meo-- Aye-aye, sir.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.263 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Spirits are free.

00:14:48.346 --> 00:14:50.098 position:50% align:center
They don't have territories.

00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:53.518 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] So, what are you
doing in these parts anyway?

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:56.646 position:50% align:center
[KOU] Just collecting some
herbs, nuts and berries.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:59.691 position:50% align:center
But I was about to head
back to my village, so...

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:00.900 position:50% align:center
See ya.

00:15:04.738 --> 00:15:07.907 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I get the distinct
feeling I should investigate.

00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:15.290 position:50% align:center
Go find a hiding place, okay?

00:15:15.373 --> 00:15:16.916 position:50% align:center
Your wish is my commyand!

00:16:03.672 --> 00:16:05.340 position:50% align:center
[BLUE]
You must be Chimera Clausen.

00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:07.509 position:50% align:center
We've got some
questions for you.

00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:08.885 position:50% align:center
[KOU] You went through
a lot of trouble coming

00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:11.346 position:50% align:center
all the way out here,
Isuzu League.

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:17.310 position:50% align:center
Shikigami Talismanic
Arts, Mizuchi!

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:41.918 position:50% align:center
An earth elemental vial!

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:46.423 position:50% align:center
[KOU] The Isuzu League's
got a lot diviners, I hear.

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:48.299 position:50% align:center
Good thing I'm prepared!

00:16:51.761 --> 00:16:54.597 position:50% align:center
Celestial Talismanic Arts,
Third Rite of Wood.

00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:57.308 position:50% align:center
Soul of Eight Trigrams!

00:16:57.392 --> 00:16:58.601 position:50% align:center
[KOU grunts]

00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:02.439 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] That's a spell
that makes your opponent

00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:04.190 position:50% align:center
feel your pain as his own.

00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:07.068 position:50% align:center
Celestial Talismanic Arts,
Third Rite of Water.

00:17:07.152 --> 00:17:08.153 position:50% align:center
Twin Reflecting Water!

00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:10.155 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
What's that one do?

00:17:10.238 --> 00:17:11.948 position:50% align:center
Mizuchi's talisman!

00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:16.911 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Wha...?

00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:18.747 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
He managed to capture him.

00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:29.132 position:50% align:center
[BLUE]
Oh, no. An anesthetic poison?

00:17:31.426 --> 00:17:32.969 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Correct.

00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:39.184 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Don't worry, I'll be quick.

00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:43.063 position:50% align:center
[KOU yelps]
The hell?

00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:50.320 position:50% align:center
Who are... you?

00:17:53.573 --> 00:17:55.700 position:50% align:center
Wait here. I've got this.

00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:12.842 position:50% align:center
[KOU] I thought you said
you were a summoner.

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:14.260 position:50% align:center
What the hell
are you doing here?

00:18:14.344 --> 00:18:16.262 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I could ask you
the same question.

00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:19.015 position:50% align:center
I believe you said you were
returning to your village?

00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:21.017 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
I just got a little lost.

00:18:21.101 --> 00:18:23.812 position:50% align:center
Whatever the excuse,
your actions are hostile.

00:18:23.895 --> 00:18:26.648 position:50% align:center
What say you tell me
something of your story?

00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:28.274 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
There's nothin' to tell.

00:18:28.358 --> 00:18:30.902 position:50% align:center
Not like I'd have reason
to tell you anyway.

00:18:38.702 --> 00:18:40.620 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Oh-ho. He knows how to fight

00:18:40.704 --> 00:18:42.956 position:50% align:center
an immortal arts practitioner
who has full control

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:45.125 position:50% align:center
over special movement skills.

00:18:52.924 --> 00:18:54.050 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
What the...?

00:18:56.845 --> 00:18:58.847 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
I've got no choice, then.

00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:11.985 position:50% align:center
[KOU] We're stunned,
but I'll regain freedom

00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:14.112 position:50% align:center
of movement before she does.

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:18.491 position:50% align:center
[KOU screams]

00:19:21.536 --> 00:19:24.789 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Why you... What did you do?

00:19:24.873 --> 00:19:28.126 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Immortal Arts:
Paralyzing Demon's Gaze.

00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:30.378 position:50% align:center
I have you fully spellbound.

00:19:32.255 --> 00:19:35.342 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
But, why can you move?

00:19:35.425 --> 00:19:37.802 position:50% align:center
The immobilizing effect
of my lightning elemental

00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:42.474 position:50% align:center
paralysis vial should've...
caught you, no problem.

00:19:42.557 --> 00:19:44.517 position:50% align:center
That would be due
to this right here.

00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:47.562 position:50% align:center
I have full resistance
to all status effects.

00:19:48.772 --> 00:19:55.862 position:50% align:center
[KOU chuckles] Fairy's Grace,
huh? You've gotta be kidding.

00:19:55.945 --> 00:20:00.533 position:50% align:center
[BLUE] I don't know who
you are, but you saved me.

00:20:00.617 --> 00:20:02.118 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:20:02.202 --> 00:20:03.495 position:50% align:center
Pay it no mind.

00:20:03.578 --> 00:20:06.164 position:50% align:center
It just so happens that
this Chimera Clausen entity

00:20:06.247 --> 00:20:08.625 position:50% align:center
is an enemy of mine as well.

00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:11.419 position:50% align:center
And who is this
beside you? A friend?

00:20:11.503 --> 00:20:15.006 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's correct.
We belong to the Isuzu League.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.508 position:50% align:center
My name is Blue.

00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:18.134 position:50% align:center
Likewise, I'm White.

00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:19.886 position:50% align:center
You may call me Mira.

00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:22.013 position:50% align:center
This little guy's
your cait-sith, right?

00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:23.973 position:50% align:center
Party Leader!

00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:27.310 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about her.
She's been super nice to me!

00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:28.311 position:50% align:center
[PURE RABBIT 10A squeaks]

00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:31.106 position:50% align:center
What's this?
You came along, too?

00:20:32.482 --> 00:20:33.775 position:50% align:center
[KOU grunts]

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:35.902 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
So, what shall we do with him?

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:38.488 position:50% align:center
[BLUE] If you don't mind,
we'd like to take care of him.

00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:41.658 position:50% align:center
We want to take him back to our
base nearby for questioning.

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:42.909 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Of course.

00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:46.996 position:50% align:center
That reminds me. On the
way back from Karanak...

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.915 position:50% align:center
So who were the
"others" you mentioned?

00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:51.751 position:50% align:center
Humans. They attacked
me by the lakeshore.

00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:54.004 position:50% align:center
In my surprise,
I fled through the grove.

00:20:54.087 --> 00:20:58.925 position:50% align:center
And when I looked back, I saw
Nyanmaru driving them off.

00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:01.803 position:50% align:center
"Nyanmaru," huh?

00:21:01.886 --> 00:21:03.096 position:50% align:center
I don't suppose
you could tell me

00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:05.056 position:50% align:center
who this Nyanmaru's master is.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.434 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I've never
met them before.

00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:12.188 position:50% align:center
And that <i>shikigami</i> 's
name is Nyanmaru.

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:14.816 position:50% align:center
Nyanmaru, eh?

00:21:14.899 --> 00:21:16.818 position:50% align:center
Does anything about
that ring a bell?

00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:18.778 position:50% align:center
It makes me think of
a certain diviner with

00:21:18.862 --> 00:21:22.198 position:50% align:center
a terrible naming sense
who uses <i>shikigami</i> .

00:21:22.282 --> 00:21:23.867 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
One of the Nine Wise Men,

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.077 position:50% align:center
the Elder of the
Tower of Divination,

00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:28.371 position:50% align:center
Kagura of the Seven Stars.

00:21:28.455 --> 00:21:30.165 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
First we have Chimera Clausen,

00:21:30.248 --> 00:21:32.417 position:50% align:center
an armed group
that captures spirits.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.045 position:50% align:center
Then the Isuzu league,
who opposes them.

00:21:35.128 --> 00:21:39.132 position:50% align:center
Finally, the <i>shikigami</i> ,
Nyanmaru, who protects spirits.

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:41.343 position:50% align:center
I wonder if the latter
two are related.

00:21:41.426 --> 00:21:42.886 position:50% align:center
Your base, huh?

00:21:42.969 --> 00:21:46.222 position:50% align:center
In that case, might I ask
to be taken there as well?

00:21:46.306 --> 00:21:49.267 position:50% align:center
Well, you did save my life,
so if it were up to me,

00:21:49.351 --> 00:21:53.605 position:50% align:center
I'd say yes, but unfortunately,
I'm but a junior in rank.

00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:55.899 position:50% align:center
That said, I'll do what
I can to advocate for you

00:21:55.982 --> 00:21:57.859 position:50% align:center
to our leader once we get there.

00:21:57.942 --> 00:22:00.362 position:50% align:center
But I make no promises,
you understand.

00:22:00.445 --> 00:22:02.781 position:50% align:center
Sure. I find that agreeable.

00:22:06.076 --> 00:22:08.161 position:50% align:center
Wrapping him in this
suppresses his abilities

00:22:08.244 --> 00:22:10.246 position:50% align:center
to one-tenth of
their full power.
