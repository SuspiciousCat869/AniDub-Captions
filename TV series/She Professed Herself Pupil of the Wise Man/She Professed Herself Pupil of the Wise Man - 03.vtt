Oh-- Perfectly prepared!

Oh, please!

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.775 position:50% align:center
I'm just lucky you and Master
Danblf have similar tastes.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:26.901 position:50% align:center
I was worried I'd have to make

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:29.070 position:50% align:center
a whole new menu
for you, Miss Mira.

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:30.155 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:31.656 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Well that's hardly a surprise

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.867 position:50% align:center
considering I <i>am</i> Danblf.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.076 position:50% align:center

supposed to tell her?

[MIRA] Must you have
called me here so suddenly?

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:20.432 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] Is it a problem that
I want to talk about something?

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:22.308 position:50% align:center
I just hope it's important.

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:24.394 position:50% align:center
You won't be disappointed.

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:26.312 position:50% align:center
But before that, go get changed.

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:27.355 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.232 position:50% align:center
[LILY]
Right this way, if you will.

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:31.317 position:50% align:center
Come along, Miss Mira,
come along!

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:33.570 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Hey! What do you
think you're doing?

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:35.822 position:50% align:center
[LILY] There, this will
be perfect on you!

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:38.199 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
No, I don't think so!

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:40.952 position:50% align:center
[LILY]
Okay, raise your leg!

00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:43.204 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Wait! Hold on!
I don't even want it!

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.253 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Why is it so important

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:52.297 position:50% align:center
that I wear this
ridiculous get-up?

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.174 position:50% align:center
I happen to think they suit you.

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:56.718 position:50% align:center
That outfit might be
Lily's best work!

00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:57.969 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:02:58.053 --> 00:03:00.096 position:50% align:center
Ugh. If Luminaria sees me
dressed like this,

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.390 position:50% align:center
she'll no doubt react
worse than before.

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:03.975 position:50% align:center
Then I guess you're in luck.

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:06.436 position:50% align:center
She's off to protect the north
and won't be back for a while.

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.898 position:50% align:center
Wish she could see how well
those clothes fit you though.

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:11.983 position:50% align:center
Yes, what a treat for us all!

00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:15.320 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] Come on, you're still
this worked up about it?

00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:18.156 position:50% align:center
Now, enough fooling around,
let's get serious.

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.617 position:50% align:center
At long last. Why am I here?

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.244 position:50% align:center
You've heard of Defense
of the Three Great Kingdoms?

00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:24.287 position:50% align:center
Ten years ago?

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:26.998 position:50% align:center
Uh. Uh-uh.

00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:28.917 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] Well, when the
game began, there were three

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.628 position:50% align:center
base countries that everyone
belonged to, right?

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:32.921 position:50% align:center
During the tutorial.

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:34.673 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Yes, I remember.

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:36.758 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] You may also remember
that they're different

00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:38.843 position:50% align:center
from player-created countries.

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:42.097 position:50% align:center
They're insanely powerful,
and couldn't be destroyed.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.808 position:50% align:center
Anyone who challenged
them would surely lose.

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:49.020 position:50% align:center
One day, hordes of demons
descended from the skies.

00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:51.147 position:50% align:center
In response,
the entire continent

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:54.192 position:50% align:center
waged a massive
war against them.

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:56.486 position:50% align:center
Thanks to over-powered
starting countries,

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.280 position:50% align:center
the humans won,
and for a while afterwards,

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:02.450 position:50% align:center
everyone focused on rebuilding,
rather than conquest.

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:05.412 position:50% align:center
It wasn't the time for humans
to be fighting each other,

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:07.956 position:50% align:center
so the "Limited Non-Aggression
Pact" was proposed

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:10.542 position:50% align:center
and quickly signed by all.

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.293 position:50% align:center
Without going into specifics,

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:16.047 position:50% align:center
the agreement banned war for ten
years from the time of signing.

00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:18.508 position:50% align:center
Which would allow each
country ample time to rebuild

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:20.885 position:50% align:center
without the threat
of imperialism.

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.595 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Huh. That's interesting.

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:26.683 position:50% align:center
And I take it the deadline
is coming up then, yes?

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:28.351 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately.

00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:32.439 position:50% align:center
And that puts us in
a particularly bad spot.

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:34.899 position:50% align:center
As you know, our kingdom
was kept safe

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:37.777 position:50% align:center
thanks to the existence
of you Nine Wise Men.

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:39.988 position:50% align:center
And take a look.

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:41.740 position:50% align:center
According to my friends list,

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:43.867 position:50% align:center
you were the final
one to return.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.369 position:50% align:center
Every one of the
Nine Wise Men are online.

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:47.287 position:50% align:center
How strange.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.663 position:50% align:center
If that's so, then tell me why

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:50.749 position:50% align:center
they wouldn't be
here with us now.

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:52.709 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
I wish I knew.

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:57.422 position:50% align:center
But, Danblf, what I do know
is that you are here right now.

00:04:57.505 --> 00:05:00.383 position:50% align:center
And just when we needed
you the most, too.

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:03.011 position:50% align:center
It's hard not to think
this was fate.

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:05.430 position:50% align:center
Fate, you say? All right.

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:06.806 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
I know the Nine Wise Men

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.601 position:50% align:center
are more stubborn individuals
than a proper group.

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:11.353 position:50% align:center
So I won't ask for them all.

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:12.645 position:50% align:center
Half is fine.

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.106 position:50% align:center
But we need them back
now more than ever.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.235 position:50% align:center
We need their strength
to protect this country!

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:23.198 position:50% align:center
Danblf--I mean, Mira,
the wise man's pupil.

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:25.450 position:50% align:center
I command you as your King!

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:29.037 position:50% align:center

of Alcait!

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.248 position:50% align:center
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:40.256 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.759 position:50% align:center
I'm not exactly sure where we
should start looking, though.

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:47.764 position:50% align:center
[gasps] How about Nebrapolis?

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:48.932 position:50% align:center
For Soul Howl?

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:51.393 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Mm-hm. Exactly right.

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:53.520 position:50% align:center
Soul Howl, the Great Wall.

00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:55.939 position:50% align:center
Elder of the Tower of
Necromancy and noted

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:57.857 position:50% align:center
obsessor of immortality.

00:05:57.941 --> 00:06:00.318 position:50% align:center
One would think the
"Ancient Temple Nebrapolis,"

00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:03.571 position:50% align:center
also known as the catacombs,
would be a paradise for him.

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:05.865 position:50% align:center
I see. Speaking of that place,

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:09.452 position:50% align:center
it also has the Dark Mirror
that lets you talk to the dead.

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:10.370 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:11.579 position:50% align:center
There's a very good chance

00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:13.581 position:50% align:center
that he'll be somewhere
in those catacombs.

00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:17.085 position:50% align:center
He always was a rather
depressing person.

00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:19.129 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] I'll leave
the heavy lifting to you.

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:21.006 position:50% align:center
I'll make the proper
arrangements with the union

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.675 position:50% align:center
so you can enter the dungeon
without any extra trouble,

00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:26.344 position:50% align:center
and I'll make sure Garret
is ready to move.

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:29.139 position:50% align:center
Hah. I take it you'd
like me to depart soon?

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:31.891 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] Yup! Time is
of the essence, after all.

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:33.351 position:50% align:center
Exasperating.

00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:35.228 position:50% align:center
And here I told Mariana
I'd be back right

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:36.813 position:50% align:center
after speaking with you.

Oh, by the way.

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:40.984 position:50% align:center
When you go to Nebrapolis,
there's one little thing

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:43.820 position:50% align:center
that I'd like you to do for me
while you're there.

time, haven't you, Garret?

explain myself first!

00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:29.843 position:50% align:center
to be had if you keep
judging by appearance.

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:32.220 position:50% align:center
Now will someone please
explain the child?

00:08:32.303 --> 00:08:34.764 position:50% align:center
Um, basically, he came
up out of nowhere

00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:36.474 position:50% align:center
and asked us to do
something crazy.

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:38.518 position:50% align:center
And when we refused,
he ran off crying,

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:41.312 position:50% align:center
which made us worry,
so we chased after him.

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:44.733 position:50% align:center
Ah. So, what was your request?

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:46.151 position:50% align:center
I'll ask you, too.

00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:49.112 position:50% align:center
I wanna go to Nebrapolis,
can you take me?

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:51.197 position:50% align:center
See? It's an obvious no.

00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:55.869 position:50% align:center
That place is dangerous.
Taking you there would be nuts.

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:57.829 position:50% align:center
Well then, why don't
we ask his reason?

00:08:57.912 --> 00:08:59.080 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:02.042 position:50% align:center
[TACT]
I want to see my mom and dad!

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:05.045 position:50% align:center
They were both adventurers
and I was told they died,

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:07.422 position:50% align:center
but I heard there's a
mirror deep in Nebrapolis

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:09.841 position:50% align:center
that lets you talk
to dead people!

00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:12.093 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Yes, The Dark Mirror.

00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:14.429 position:50% align:center
I just wanna see them
for a second, really!

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:17.891 position:50% align:center
They're my mom and dad!

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:21.144 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] This feels like it would
be a sub quest in the old game.

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:22.729 position:50% align:center
Ah, how heart-wrenching.

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:27.067 position:50% align:center
After that story,
how could I not help?

00:09:29.444 --> 00:09:30.987 position:50% align:center
Coincidentally,
I was planning on

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:33.239 position:50% align:center
heading there myself,
so it's no trouble.

00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:35.575 position:50% align:center
Wow, thank you
so, so much, Miss!

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:36.785 position:50% align:center
My name's Tact!

00:09:36.868 --> 00:09:39.079 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute!
You should think it through.

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:41.581 position:50% align:center
Taking a child like him
to a place that treacherous

00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:43.249 position:50% align:center
is beyond reckless!

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:46.544 position:50% align:center
Don't think a "little girl"
will be able to protect him?

00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:47.921 position:50% align:center
[EMELLA]
Wait, stop!

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:49.631 position:50% align:center
Ugh, all right, fine!

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:52.384 position:50% align:center
My name is Emella,
we'll go with you two!

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:54.177 position:50% align:center
If we don't, they'll die.

00:09:57.222 --> 00:10:00.266 position:50% align:center
They're running quite late.
I hope they're not backing out.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.185 position:50% align:center
[EMELLA]
Hey!

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:05.230 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] They've brought
a whole brigade.

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:06.815 position:50% align:center
[EMELLA]
Sorry, sorry.

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:09.818 position:50% align:center
We're part of a guild
known as Écarlate Carillon.

00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:12.946 position:50% align:center
I asked a few members
to help us out, just in case.

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:15.198 position:50% align:center
[ASVAL]
Hey. So you're Mira, huh?

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:18.368 position:50% align:center
Well, you can call me Asval.
It's a pleasure.

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:20.662 position:50% align:center
I'm Flicker. Hello there.

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:23.707 position:50% align:center
Good to meet you. This is Tact.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:27.210 position:50% align:center
[FLICKER panting] There's just
something about you, Mira.

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:30.005 position:50% align:center
You smell so good.
It's intoxicating!

00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:31.715 position:50% align:center
I can smell your purity!

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:33.591 position:50% align:center
--Oh, Mira!
--[MIRA] Uh, get off me!

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:34.843 position:50% align:center
[EMELLA]
Cool it, Flicker!

00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:36.594 position:50% align:center
Okay, I give up!

00:10:36.678 --> 00:10:40.473 position:50% align:center
Sorry about that, Mira.
I know we don't seem like it,

00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:43.351 position:50% align:center
but the four of us are
high-level adventurers.

00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:44.728 position:50% align:center
I'm glad to hear that.

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:47.355 position:50% align:center
Seems like you've been
blessed with good luck, Tact.

00:10:47.439 --> 00:10:48.732 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:50.859 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Not that it's all good.

00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:53.737 position:50% align:center
Well then, let's head out!

00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:58.575 position:50% align:center
[EMELLA] Remember, everyone,
we're headed for

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:01.578 position:50% align:center
the Hall of Darkness
on the fifth level.

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:02.996 position:50% align:center
[ASVAL] So are you sure
we can count on

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:04.664 position:50% align:center
these summoning techniques?

00:11:04.748 --> 00:11:05.874 position:50% align:center
Don't wanna be rude.

00:11:05.957 --> 00:11:07.834 position:50% align:center
I've just never fought
with a summoner before.

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.044 position:50% align:center
'Course you haven't.

00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:10.712 position:50% align:center
They're practically
an endangered species

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:11.921 position:50% align:center
at this point.

00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:13.923 position:50% align:center
The few that are left
are only hobbyists.

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:15.967 position:50% align:center
What did you just say?!

00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:17.093 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:21.639 position:50% align:center
Summoners are a rare breed now?

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:24.184 position:50% align:center
How did that happen
in 30 years?

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:25.477 position:50% align:center
No matter!

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.312 position:50% align:center
I'll simply use our venture
into the catacombs

00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:29.856 position:50% align:center
to show what summoners
are capable of.

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:32.150 position:50% align:center
Good attitude.
I'm lookin' forward to it!

00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:34.652 position:50% align:center
We're ready whenever you
are, just say the word!

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:36.613 position:50% align:center
And remember to keep
an eye on Tact for us,

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.156 position:50% align:center
we don't want him
getting lost in there.

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:40.492 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm well aware, thank you.

00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:42.786 position:50% align:center
Oh, is that a
Light Spirit Sword?

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:45.121 position:50% align:center
It's something interesting,
that's for sure.

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:46.748 position:50% align:center
Wow, you know a lot.

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:48.249 position:50% align:center
Considering what
we're up against,

00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:51.127 position:50% align:center
I asked to borrow it
from our guild captain.

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.630 position:50% align:center
[FLICKER] She could tell
that's a light spirit sword?

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:56.007 position:50% align:center
Just who is she?

00:11:57.008 --> 00:12:00.095 position:50% align:center
All I know for sure
is that she's cute!

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.892 position:50% align:center
Now then, it's about
time we began.

00:12:19.531 --> 00:12:20.699 position:50% align:center
Whoa, awesome!

00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:23.702 position:50% align:center
An armor spirit? What power!

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:25.829 position:50% align:center
Man, woudlja look at that thing?

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:27.205 position:50% align:center
Impressed?

00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:29.290 position:50% align:center
You weren't expecting me
to summon this, were you?

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:32.335 position:50% align:center
He's more than capable
of protecting Tact.

00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:34.337 position:50% align:center
Hate to break up the party.

00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:36.172 position:50% align:center
But we got some visitors.

00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:39.175 position:50% align:center
And they're stinky.

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:42.012 position:50% align:center
Must be Nebrapolis'
famous ghouls.

00:12:44.055 --> 00:12:45.724 position:50% align:center
Yes, now show me.

00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:47.726 position:50% align:center
How do you four
deal with enemies?

00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:49.269 position:50% align:center
I start us off!

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:56.776 position:50% align:center
I take the back!

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:00.405 position:50% align:center
Then me!

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:04.034 position:50% align:center
I get the leftovers!

00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:08.413 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
I admit, you all did well, but,

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:10.665 position:50% align:center
it stinks even worse now!

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:14.252 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Oh, great, and I just remembered

00:13:14.336 --> 00:13:17.088 position:50% align:center
there's a giant ghoul
deeper inside!

00:13:18.882 --> 00:13:21.968 position:50% align:center
I've already endured enough
adventuring for one day.

00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:23.094 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:30.727 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.187 position:50% align:center
What are you planning to do?

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:33.646 position:50% align:center
Oh, you'll see.

00:13:38.485 --> 00:13:40.570 position:50% align:center
I call upon you,
Soaring Maiden!

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:43.823 position:50% align:center
Lead us with your blade
and recite thy name!

00:13:45.575 --> 00:13:46.993 position:50% align:center
[ALFINA]
I am Alfina.

00:13:47.077 --> 00:13:50.538 position:50% align:center
My loyalty lies
with you, my master.

00:13:50.622 --> 00:13:51.873 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Come to me!

00:14:06.763 --> 00:14:09.474 position:50% align:center
[ALFINA] I am here
just as you commanded.

00:14:09.557 --> 00:14:11.142 position:50% align:center
Greetings, master.

00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:14.479 position:50% align:center
It's been quite
a while, eh, Alfina?

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:15.980 position:50% align:center
Truly.

00:14:16.064 --> 00:14:19.484 position:50% align:center
Although, master, have you not
changed since last we met?

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:22.612 position:50% align:center
Uh-- Well, that's
a story for another time.

00:14:22.696 --> 00:14:25.740 position:50% align:center
Uh. So are you gonna
introduce us to your friend?

00:14:25.824 --> 00:14:28.118 position:50% align:center
Such overflowing
magical power!

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:30.704 position:50% align:center
Ah. This is Alfina
of the Valkyries.

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:32.288 position:50% align:center
[ALFINA]
Yes, that I am.

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:34.124 position:50% align:center
I'm pleased to meet you all.

00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:36.876 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasping]

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.878 position:50% align:center
So master, your orders?

00:14:38.962 --> 00:14:41.339 position:50% align:center
All right. Alfina, my Valkyrie.

00:14:41.423 --> 00:14:43.967 position:50% align:center
Destroy all monsters from
here to the fifth level.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:45.802 position:50% align:center
Leave none behind!

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:47.178 position:50% align:center
Happily!

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:08.408 position:50% align:center
[GIANT GHOUL 3A growls]

00:15:19.878 --> 00:15:22.047 position:50% align:center
Annihilation complete.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.048 position:50% align:center
Already?

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:24.924 position:50% align:center
I thank you
for your hard work.

00:15:25.008 --> 00:15:26.593 position:50% align:center
You may rest now.

00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:37.270 position:50% align:center
[ZEF] Man, this is crazy,
there's really no monsters left.

00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:40.690 position:50% align:center
Unless you count this pile of
ashes they turned into, that is.

00:15:40.774 --> 00:15:42.067 position:50% align:center
[ASVAL]
I don't.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:45.862 position:50% align:center
Oh, sweet, a mobility stone!
Must be my lucky day!

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:48.448 position:50% align:center
Strange to think this
is a C-rank dungeon.

00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:50.367 position:50% align:center
We can just stroll
right through it now.

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.702 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Nothin'
wrong with that.

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:53.912 position:50% align:center
We should be grateful

00:15:53.995 --> 00:15:56.581 position:50% align:center
we can wrap this up
so quick and go home.

00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:07.342 position:50% align:center
[FLICKER]
The Dark Mirror, I assume?

00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:09.469 position:50% align:center
To use it, focus
your mind on the people

00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:11.930 position:50% align:center
you want to see,
and speak their names.

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:12.972 position:50% align:center
Okay, Tact?

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:14.641 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah!

00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:21.106 position:50% align:center
I wanna see my dad, Ashley,
and my mom, Lenee!

00:16:24.609 --> 00:16:26.236 position:50% align:center
[TACT]
Uh. Um.

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:27.487 position:50% align:center
Can you see anything?

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:28.488 position:50% align:center
No, nothing.

00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:29.698 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:34.327 position:50% align:center
Do Mom and Dad not wanna
see me or something?

00:16:34.411 --> 00:16:37.080 position:50% align:center
Considering how long the
mirror has been left on its own,

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:40.000 position:50% align:center
maybe it's simply not
functioning at the moment.

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:42.210 position:50% align:center
You think? After all that?

00:16:44.713 --> 00:16:45.505 position:50% align:center
Lyrica.

00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:46.715 position:50% align:center
U-Uh--

00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:51.177 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:16:58.101 --> 00:17:00.645 position:50% align:center
Is that you?

00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:03.314 position:50% align:center
She's really here. My sister!

00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:05.900 position:50% align:center
[ZEF]
Delicious!

00:17:05.984 --> 00:17:09.154 position:50% align:center
It's getting closer to the way
Mom used to make it, huh?

00:17:09.237 --> 00:17:12.365 position:50% align:center
Totally. Man, you get
better and better every time!

00:17:12.449 --> 00:17:14.617 position:50% align:center
But cooking's not
too hard on you, is it?

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:15.994 position:50% align:center
Nope!

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:17.579 position:50% align:center
And I can't just keep
sleeping while you're out--

00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:21.249 position:50% align:center
[coughs]

00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:22.751 position:50% align:center
[LYRICA]
I'm fine.

00:17:22.834 --> 00:17:26.296 position:50% align:center
Don't worry,
just focus on your job.

00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:43.813 position:50% align:center
[ASVAL] Hey, what's a kid
like you doing here?

00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:46.191 position:50% align:center
This work's no joke.
You could die.

00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:48.443 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know that,
but this pays the best.

00:17:48.526 --> 00:17:49.944 position:50% align:center
My parents aren't around.

00:17:50.028 --> 00:17:53.698 position:50% align:center
Got a sick sister, so I need
to make money for her meds.

00:17:53.782 --> 00:17:56.368 position:50% align:center
She's sick, huh?

00:17:56.451 --> 00:17:58.328 position:50% align:center
Her symptoms sound
like the late stages

00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:00.205 position:50% align:center
of that illness going around.

00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:02.499 position:50% align:center
I hope we make it.

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:04.417 position:50% align:center
[ZEF]
I'm finally back.

00:18:04.501 --> 00:18:06.628 position:50% align:center
[gasps] The light's off!

00:18:07.837 --> 00:18:10.173 position:50% align:center
[ZEF]
Lyrica! Lyrica!

00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:14.678 position:50% align:center
[ZEF]
Lyrica. I'm... sorry.

00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:16.805 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry I was
too late to help you!

00:18:16.888 --> 00:18:18.515 position:50% align:center
[LYRICA]
It's okay.

00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:20.558 position:50% align:center
[ZEF]
If I had come home sooner.

00:18:20.642 --> 00:18:21.851 position:50% align:center
Then...

00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:23.937 position:50% align:center
Please don't blame yourself.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.981 position:50% align:center
You truly did everything
that you could.

00:18:27.065 --> 00:18:30.777 position:50% align:center
And the last thing I want
is to hear you say sorry!

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:35.115 position:50% align:center
What I want is to thank you,
for how hard you worked for me.

00:18:35.198 --> 00:18:37.033 position:50% align:center
So "thank you!" Understand?

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:37.909 position:50% align:center
"Thank you!"

00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:40.120 position:50% align:center
[yelps] Welcome!

00:18:40.203 --> 00:18:43.248 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] There's the
brother I remember.

00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:45.291 position:50% align:center
Lyrica. I still--

00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:46.376 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:47.627 position:50% align:center
Pull it together!

00:18:47.711 --> 00:18:49.587 position:50% align:center
And here I thought you
changed since we met,

00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:52.048 position:50% align:center
but you're as big
a crybaby as ever.

00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:53.383 position:50% align:center
[ZEF]
Asval.

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:54.968 position:50% align:center
Your sister's in front of you.

00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:57.345 position:50% align:center
Do you really want her to
see you as a blubbering mess

00:18:57.429 --> 00:18:59.889 position:50% align:center
after all this time apart?

00:18:59.973 --> 00:19:01.766 position:50% align:center
[ZEF]
No. You're right.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:03.476 position:50% align:center
Hey, Lyrica.

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:06.312 position:50% align:center
Look.

00:19:06.396 --> 00:19:08.773 position:50% align:center
I'm in a strong guild, and
I've made great friends there!

00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:11.109 position:50% align:center
I've gotten really good
at recon and stuff,

00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:12.694 position:50% align:center
and I can take down
my share of enemies

00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:14.404 position:50% align:center
with just a pair of knives!

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:16.781 position:50% align:center
I've become a pretty
damn good scout, too.

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:18.992 position:50% align:center
[giggles] I'm glad to hear it.

00:19:19.075 --> 00:19:20.994 position:50% align:center
It sounds like you've
grown up a whole lot,

00:19:21.077 --> 00:19:23.163 position:50% align:center
and have made a wonderful life.

00:19:23.246 --> 00:19:25.540 position:50% align:center
Yeah. And I'll keep on
being a big brother

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:27.917 position:50% align:center
that you can really
be proud of, deal?

00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:30.545 position:50% align:center
Deal. I'll be watching.

00:19:36.384 --> 00:19:38.762 position:50% align:center
[LYRICA]
Goodbye.

00:19:38.845 --> 00:19:41.181 position:50% align:center
I'll always love you, brother.

00:19:41.264 --> 00:19:43.933 position:50% align:center
I'll always
love you, too, Lyrica.

00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:49.939 position:50% align:center
[ZEF whimpers]

00:19:57.697 --> 00:19:59.949 position:50% align:center
There must be
something in my eye.

00:20:00.033 --> 00:20:03.745 position:50% align:center
Damn! I'm weak to these
kinds of plotlines!

00:20:03.828 --> 00:20:06.039 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] They used to be
nothing more than NPCs,

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:09.501 position:50% align:center
but now each of them
have their own lives.

00:20:09.584 --> 00:20:11.628 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
We can't confirm it this moment,

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:14.964 position:50% align:center
but my theory is that Tact's
parents have not perished.

00:20:15.048 --> 00:20:16.591 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:20:16.675 --> 00:20:18.677 position:50% align:center
The Dark Mirror
only reflects the dead.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.971 position:50% align:center
Anything alive won't
appear. You see?

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:24.599 position:50% align:center
But the adventurer's union
told me they're dead.

00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:26.142 position:50% align:center
That's how you heard?

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:28.395 position:50% align:center
Anyone who's been missing for
five years is declared dead,

00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:30.230 position:50% align:center
so maybe that's all it is.

00:20:30.313 --> 00:20:32.691 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. Just because the
union declared them dead

00:20:32.774 --> 00:20:35.944 position:50% align:center
doesn't mean anyone
actually confirmed it.

00:20:36.027 --> 00:20:38.279 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you'll find
them someday, bud.

00:20:38.363 --> 00:20:40.198 position:50% align:center
So make sure you live it up!

00:20:40.281 --> 00:20:43.326 position:50% align:center
That way, when you see 'em,
you'll have lots to tell 'em!

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.329 position:50% align:center
You got it!
Thank you guys so much!

00:20:46.413 --> 00:20:47.956 position:50% align:center
All right. Now that that's over,

00:20:48.039 --> 00:20:50.583 position:50% align:center
I can move on to the other
request made of me.

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:51.876 position:50% align:center
Request?

00:20:54.421 --> 00:20:55.839 position:50% align:center
There's one little thing
that I'd like you

00:20:55.922 --> 00:20:59.300 position:50% align:center
to do for me while you're there.

00:20:59.384 --> 00:21:00.927 position:50% align:center
You see, a long time ago,

00:21:01.011 --> 00:21:03.555 position:50% align:center
there was a demon scholar
NPC who would chase

00:21:03.638 --> 00:21:06.141 position:50% align:center
lesser demons around with
a vial of holy water.

00:21:06.224 --> 00:21:08.476 position:50% align:center
I was wondering if his
expertise could help us

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.354 position:50% align:center
figure out what's been going on
with the sudden hordes lately.

00:21:11.438 --> 00:21:13.440 position:50% align:center
Ah, that's right.
You mean Howard.

00:21:13.523 --> 00:21:14.607 position:50% align:center
I remember him.

00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:16.359 position:50% align:center
But I also seem to
recall him passing away.

00:21:16.443 --> 00:21:17.861 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
That's right.

00:21:17.944 --> 00:21:20.530 position:50% align:center
Which is why I want you
to use the Dark Mirror.

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:22.824 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] To reflect the dead,
you require a living person

00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:25.618 position:50% align:center
who was close to them in their
time, or at the very least,

00:21:25.702 --> 00:21:28.079 position:50% align:center
a meaningful keepsake
of the departed.

00:21:28.163 --> 00:21:30.540 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure that this
counts as meaningful.

00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:33.543 position:50% align:center
Even Solomon had his doubts,
but let's experiment.

00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:35.295 position:50% align:center
Hey, Howard.

00:21:35.378 --> 00:21:39.591 position:50% align:center
Look, it's the holy water
that you loved so much!

00:21:39.674 --> 00:21:41.176 position:50% align:center
What? Too little?

00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:43.053 position:50% align:center
Is this not
sufficient holy water?

00:21:43.136 --> 00:21:45.764 position:50% align:center
Do I really need more than
this to pique your interest?

00:21:45.847 --> 00:21:47.891 position:50% align:center
Mira. What are you doing?

00:21:47.974 --> 00:21:49.893 position:50% align:center
Is there a reason you're
throwing water at it?

00:21:49.976 --> 00:21:52.395 position:50% align:center
Yes, there's someone I was
instructed to call upon

00:21:52.479 --> 00:21:55.523 position:50% align:center
while we were here, but it seems
that it was not meant to be.

00:21:55.607 --> 00:21:59.110 position:50% align:center
It-It's Mira's holy water.

00:21:59.194 --> 00:22:01.029 position:50% align:center
What I wouldn't give
to get a hold of that!

00:22:01.112 --> 00:22:02.572 position:50% align:center
I gotta. I just gotta.

00:22:02.655 --> 00:22:04.783 position:50% align:center
I gotta have her holy water!

00:22:04.866 --> 00:22:06.826 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] It looks like I've
inadvertently called upon

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:09.120 position:50% align:center
an even more frightening force.
