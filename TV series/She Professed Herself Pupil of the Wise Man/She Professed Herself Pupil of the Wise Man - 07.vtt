00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:13.638 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Now then. I think
I should take some time

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:16.433 position:50% align:center
to reflect and consider
my next move.

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:21.604 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Soul Howl seeks the
Holy Grail of Heavenly Light.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:26.359 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] To learn where to find
the materials to make it,

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:28.820 position:50% align:center
I'll need to head on an
expedition to the bottom level

00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:33.992 position:50% align:center
of the enormous archive known
as Fool the Wunderkammer.

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:37.495 position:50% align:center
In order to go there,
we need Firefly Glowstone.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.582 position:50% align:center
Luckily, Garrett was able
to obtain some recently.

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:42.042 position:50% align:center
Which means, the only
thing between

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:45.462 position:50% align:center
Fool the Wunderkammer and I
is making my way there.

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:49.674 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I've already come
to Alcait Academy.

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:55.055 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Beneath this institute
is the entrance to the archive.

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:57.474 position:50% align:center
Now to find a way inside.

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:08.860 position:50% align:center
Ah, the wonders of youth!

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:10.653 position:50% align:center
Hey. What are you doing?

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:13.323 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:16.451 position:50% align:center
[HINATA] Are you interested
in joining the academy?

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:53.131 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
I'm sorry, did I startle you?

00:02:53.214 --> 00:02:55.300 position:50% align:center
I'm a teacher on staff
here at the academy.

00:02:55.383 --> 00:02:58.219 position:50% align:center
You can call me Hinata.
And you are?

00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:00.096 position:50% align:center
You may call me Mira.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.099 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Judging by those ears
she's one of the Miao.

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:06.061 position:50% align:center
Did you say Mira?
That's a cute name you've got!

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:09.314 position:50% align:center
Those magical girl style clothes
are all the rage right now.

00:03:09.397 --> 00:03:10.648 position:50% align:center
Since you've got a robe-type,

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:12.859 position:50% align:center
does that mean you want
to become a mage?

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:15.111 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. I'm actually
already a mage.

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.030 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
Uh-- Huh?!

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:20.200 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Seems I've gotten used to
getting this kind of reaction.

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:23.370 position:50% align:center
Oh, I had no idea!

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:24.537 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:27.290 position:50% align:center
Uh, can I ask what
kind of mage you are?

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:31.461 position:50% align:center
Ah. Yes, of course.
I'm a summoner.

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:35.173 position:50% align:center
What does that untellable
look on your face mean?

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:38.385 position:50% align:center
[HINATA] Sorry, it's just--
That's what I am, too.

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:41.471 position:50% align:center
I teach evocation magic
at this academy.

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:43.306 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Oh, is that so?

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.811 position:50% align:center
Though there's only a few
students studying it.

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:50.021 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:52.899 position:50% align:center
Now that you mention it,
looking around, I don't spot

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:54.943 position:50% align:center
a single person
practicing summoning

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:57.445 position:50% align:center
or studying
evocation literature.

00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:58.988 position:50% align:center
Without any students to teach,

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:02.158 position:50% align:center
there's nothing for me to do
but look on in envy.

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:03.034 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Poor woman!

00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:04.619 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
But it's okay!

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:07.706 position:50% align:center
We have Master Cleos, the acting
Elder of the Tower of Evocation!

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.624 position:50% align:center
He's been burning
the midnight oil,

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:12.836 position:50% align:center
studying and practicing
old contract methods!

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.672 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Cleos, huh? That's good to hear.

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:17.590 position:50% align:center
Clearly the supplies
and equipment I left him

00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:19.342 position:50% align:center
are being put to good use.

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:21.261 position:50% align:center
His success rate's
been fantastic!

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:23.138 position:50% align:center
So don't you worry,
the age of summoners

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:24.681 position:50% align:center
is just around the corner!

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:25.849 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear.

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:27.559 position:50% align:center
I wish there was
something I could do

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:29.686 position:50% align:center
to increase our reputation.

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:32.897 position:50% align:center
[gasps] No way!
Is this a user's bangle?

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:34.983 position:50% align:center
Then you're a
high-level adventurer!

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:37.193 position:50% align:center
Well, yes, I suppose so.

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:38.611 position:50% align:center
These are my contracts!

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:42.157 position:50% align:center
Got a Dark Knight, a Holy
Knight, some Hell Hounds,

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.661 position:50% align:center
Salamanders, Carbuncles, and of
course, some awesome Wyverns.

00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:49.789 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Ah, yes, the most
basic lineup possible.

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:52.334 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mira, have you contracted
with any other spirits?

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:53.501 position:50% align:center
I'd love to know!

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:56.671 position:50% align:center
I mean, as a matter
of fact, I... have?

00:04:56.755 --> 00:05:01.343 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Please, help me out
a little bit, will you?

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:03.136 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:06.848 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
This is the Mage Arts Review?

00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:08.266 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
Yes.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.101 position:50% align:center
It's a monthly symposium where
each department competes

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:12.562 position:50% align:center
by presenting spells.

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:14.230 position:50% align:center
And depending on
how you're rated,

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.733 position:50% align:center
you might be allocated
more research funding,

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:19.819 position:50% align:center
or gain greater access
to academy facilities.

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:21.571 position:50% align:center
Ah, interesting.

00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:24.240 position:50% align:center
[HINATA] But, the Evocation
Department has come in last

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:26.618 position:50% align:center
the past few years.

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:27.744 position:50% align:center
Don't get me wrong,

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:30.455 position:50% align:center
my spirits are good
little companions.

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:32.749 position:50% align:center
But I don't have
that many of them.

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:35.877 position:50% align:center
And they're not flashy and new,
so they don't impress much.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.128 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Poor woman!

00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:38.922 position:50% align:center
So I was thinking,
if we summoned a different

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.424 position:50% align:center
kind of spirit that
no one's ever seen before,

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:44.719 position:50% align:center
we might be able to get
ranked a bit higher today.

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:49.766 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I should really be
concentrating on getting myself

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.893 position:50% align:center
into Fool the Wunderkammer.

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:54.020 position:50% align:center
But seeing the way
summoning magic has declined

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:56.272 position:50% align:center
after my years of absence
makes it difficult

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:59.484 position:50% align:center
to focus on anything else.

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:02.862 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
I understand. Say no more.

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:04.864 position:50% align:center
All I need to do is go
out there and show them

00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:07.784 position:50% align:center
what summoning magic
is capable of. That's it!

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.160 position:50% align:center
You'll really do it?

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:11.454 position:50% align:center
[CAERUS]
Well, if it isn't Ms. Hinata.

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:13.248 position:50% align:center
Hope that kid you brought
doesn't expect you

00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:14.499 position:50% align:center
to pull out a win.

00:06:14.582 --> 00:06:15.917 position:50% align:center
You're misunderstanding.

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:18.670 position:50% align:center
This "kid" is our
representative this time.

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:21.423 position:50% align:center
[CAERUS] Seriously?
Some random little girl?

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:23.299 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see, if you
send a kid out,

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.218 position:50% align:center
the judges'll go easy on her!

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:27.429 position:50% align:center
And maybe you can scrape
together a few extra points!

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:30.140 position:50% align:center
[LACKEYS laugh]

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:32.851 position:50% align:center
Oh, well, just do your
best like always.

00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:35.103 position:50% align:center
Our Sorcery Department'll
take first place

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:36.771 position:50% align:center
no matter what you do!

00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:41.151 position:50% align:center
[LACKEYS laugh]

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:42.652 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Good grief.

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:45.280 position:50% align:center
Who in the world was
that pompous jerk?

00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:46.614 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh...

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:50.368 position:50% align:center
His name's Caerus Berling.
He's from a mage family,

00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:52.662 position:50% align:center
and a distinguished one at that.

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:55.123 position:50% align:center
He sounds like a typical
uppity artistocrat.

00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:58.126 position:50% align:center
[HINATA] Yeah, but,
he really is a talented mage!

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:00.670 position:50% align:center
Ever since he came into the
picture, the Sorcery Department

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:03.298 position:50% align:center
has monopolized
the number one spot.

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:07.177 position:50% align:center
So he's someone
with moderate skills,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.637 position:50% align:center
but severely lacking
in emotional maturity.

00:07:09.721 --> 00:07:12.599 position:50% align:center
Yes. You can find his sort
everywhere you go.

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:15.602 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:22.067 position:50% align:center
[HINATA] It's okay.
Today will be different.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.694 position:50% align:center
I don't know how far we'll go,
but with Mira's help,

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:27.947 position:50% align:center
evocation magic will
make a comeback!

00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:29.741 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:33.036 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! I don't like that
frustration on your face!

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:34.954 position:50% align:center
Sorry. To appease the crowd,

00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:37.624 position:50% align:center
I was planning to summon
something as big and flashy

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:41.419 position:50% align:center
as possible, but the venue
is smaller than I expected.

00:07:41.503 --> 00:07:43.963 position:50% align:center
If I were to summon who I was
thinking of in this arena,

00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:46.758 position:50% align:center
he'd fill every seat on his own.

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:48.551 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
How big is this thing?

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:51.221 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Who would be
the best choice now?

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.515 position:50% align:center
I'm in need of
a big showy summon.

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:55.266 position:50% align:center
A show-mon!

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.687 position:50% align:center
[HINATA] I guess she's spirited
enough to make bad puns.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.648 position:50% align:center
I think she can do this.

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:03.274 position:50% align:center
[CHAIRMAN 07A]
Thank you all for waiting!

00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:07.445 position:50% align:center
We will now begin
the Mage Arts Review!

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:10.490 position:50% align:center
For those of you who are new,
I'll explain the rules briefly.

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:13.451 position:50% align:center
Each representative is given
ten minutes center stage,

00:08:13.535 --> 00:08:15.912 position:50% align:center
during which they will
present their spells.

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:17.706 position:50% align:center
[CHAIRMAN 07A] Attack-type
spells will target this

00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:21.126 position:50% align:center
armor dummy that is specialized
to withstand such an onslaught.

00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:23.545 position:50% align:center
And that's just about it, folks!

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:26.047 position:50% align:center
Now, let's start with
the Sorcery Department!

00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:29.968 position:50% align:center
They received the highest score
last time, so they go first.

00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:31.886 position:50% align:center
Representative, come forth!

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:35.974 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheers]

00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:38.518 position:50% align:center
Last time, with some
amazing water magic.

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:41.896 position:50% align:center
The Sorcery Department earned a
score that eclipsed the others!

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.815 position:50% align:center
I think I speak for
all of us when I say

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:45.900 position:50% align:center
I'm looking forward
to their exhibition!

00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:47.902 position:50% align:center
Good thing I'm not a judge!

00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:49.070 position:50% align:center
[CAERUS]
Hey. You.

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:50.113 position:50% align:center
Hey, you!

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:52.490 position:50% align:center
It wasn't just
"last time," was it?

00:08:52.574 --> 00:08:54.743 position:50% align:center
More like "every time." Got it?

Please, his technique
is lacking.

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:44.751 position:50% align:center
His accuracy and timing
are completely erratic.

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:47.545 position:50% align:center
[HINATA] Yeah, but look at
how well the judges score him.

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:49.589 position:50% align:center
These judges don't
care about practicality,

00:09:49.673 --> 00:09:53.343 position:50% align:center
just about how cool and easily
understandable a spell is.

"Cool and easily
understandable?"

00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:58.515 position:50% align:center
That settles it. I know
exactly who to summon

Oh. Yeah, that's right!

hear "Melodia Fresh Verdure"?

Anything for you, Maestro.

Oh, I'm sure you can guess.

00:18:56.594 --> 00:18:59.139 position:50% align:center
it can infinitely expand
how you do battle."

00:18:59.222 --> 00:19:00.306 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right?

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.851 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Impressive.
You're a good student.

00:19:02.934 --> 00:19:05.770 position:50% align:center
But, I was still one
move ahead of you.

00:19:10.275 --> 00:19:12.318 position:50% align:center
Don't think that
this is the end.

00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:14.738 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:23.747 position:50% align:center
[CLEOS]
I yield.

00:19:25.248 --> 00:19:26.624 position:50% align:center
[CLEOS]
Honestly, I had no idea

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:29.627 position:50% align:center
you'd already deployed
that many spells.

00:19:29.711 --> 00:19:32.047 position:50% align:center
Such speed and accuracy!

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.757 position:50% align:center
I take it you were
pulling your punches in

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.425 position:50% align:center
your earlier duel today?

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:36.843 position:50% align:center
Well, yes.

00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:39.471 position:50% align:center
I wasn't going to fight in
earnest against a student.

00:19:39.554 --> 00:19:41.931 position:50% align:center
But, you did pretty
well for yourself.

00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:45.018 position:50% align:center
With that child, he foamed
at the mouth and threw a fit

00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:47.437 position:50% align:center
when he was surrounded
by my Dark Knights.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.190 position:50% align:center
I would hope not to be
lumped in with a student.

00:19:50.273 --> 00:19:54.694 position:50% align:center
But then, from your perspective,
we're about the same.

00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:59.949 position:50% align:center
Allow me to welcome
you back, Master Danblf.

00:20:00.033 --> 00:20:02.702 position:50% align:center
Having dueled you
myself, I'm sure now.

00:20:02.786 --> 00:20:04.871 position:50% align:center
To be able to use that
many summoning spells,

00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:08.583 position:50% align:center
I've no doubt in my mind I'm
dealing with the One-Man Army.

00:20:08.667 --> 00:20:11.461 position:50% align:center
You're mistaken, that's just
what my teacher taught me!

00:20:11.544 --> 00:20:13.421 position:50% align:center
I can't speak for anyone else.

00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:15.632 position:50% align:center
But as an Elder,
I won't be deceived.

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:18.468 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you know that.

00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:20.011 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Ugh...

00:20:22.806 --> 00:20:23.890 position:50% align:center
Okay, you win.

00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:25.975 position:50% align:center
I am indeed the real Danblf.

00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:27.477 position:50% align:center
[CLEOS]
Thought so.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.480 position:50% align:center
The only difference is how much
more adorable you are now!

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:33.858 position:50% align:center
I'd appreciate it if you
didn't ask about that.

00:20:33.942 --> 00:20:36.736 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I knew my ruse would
be discovered eventually.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.988 position:50% align:center
Might as well tell Mariana now.

00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:41.700 position:50% align:center
[CLEOS]
Well then.

00:20:41.783 --> 00:20:43.785 position:50% align:center
Master Dan-- Oh, um.

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:46.621 position:50% align:center
I should continue to call you
Miss Mira, shouldn't I?

00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:48.707 position:50% align:center
Now that my suspicions
have been resolved.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.959 position:50% align:center
Down to business.

00:20:51.042 --> 00:20:54.212 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] About getting into
Fool the Wunderkammer.

00:20:57.298 --> 00:20:59.509 position:50% align:center
[CLEOS]
Ms. Hinata. What's wrong?

00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:00.719 position:50% align:center
You should be happy,

00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:03.638 position:50% align:center
we're celebrating your
hard-earned victory!

00:21:03.722 --> 00:21:06.516 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I think too much
happened in one day.

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:08.852 position:50% align:center
That's the understatement
of the century!

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:10.937 position:50% align:center
First we got top marks
at the Review,

00:21:11.021 --> 00:21:13.440 position:50% align:center
then I just casually
met the acting Elder.

00:21:13.523 --> 00:21:16.401 position:50% align:center
And now, I find out Mira is
the pupil of the one and only

00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:19.904 position:50% align:center
Master Danblf,
the One-Man Army!

00:21:19.988 --> 00:21:21.322 position:50% align:center
[MIRA, CLEOS laugh]

00:21:21.406 --> 00:21:24.034 position:50% align:center
Miss Mira, try not to have
too much to drink tonight.

00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:26.286 position:50% align:center
Can't have it affecting
tomorrow's work.

00:21:26.369 --> 00:21:30.665 position:50% align:center
No need to worry, this is just
apple <i>au lait</i> , not alcohol.

00:21:30.749 --> 00:21:33.251 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
Um, "tomorrow's work?"

00:21:33.335 --> 00:21:36.796 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Yes. I have some business
in the underground archive.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.507 position:50% align:center
[CLEOS] I already spoke to
the academy director about it.

00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:41.926 position:50% align:center
We can go in whenever we like.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:44.346 position:50% align:center
That said, I have some
preparations to make,

00:21:44.429 --> 00:21:45.847 position:50% align:center
so I'll excuse myself.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.223 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
Wait a second!

00:21:47.307 --> 00:21:49.809 position:50% align:center
Would you two please let me
come with you tomorrow?

00:21:49.893 --> 00:21:52.062 position:50% align:center
Umm, sort of like,
for future reference?

00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:54.230 position:50% align:center
I feel like seeing the two
of you in actual combat

00:21:54.314 --> 00:21:57.359 position:50% align:center
is something I'd
learn a lot from.

00:21:57.442 --> 00:21:59.444 position:50% align:center
Sure. I don't mind.

00:21:59.527 --> 00:22:01.529 position:50% align:center
[squeals]

00:22:15.043 --> 00:22:16.336 position:50% align:center
This is it.

00:22:16.419 --> 00:22:18.797 position:50% align:center
Who knows what we're
going to find down here?

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.006 position:50% align:center
Ready?
