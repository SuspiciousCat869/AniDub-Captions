00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:21.521 position:50% align:center
[EMELLA grunts] Come on!
There's no end to them!

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:23.231 position:50% align:center
Flicker, can you burn them

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:25.150 position:50% align:center
but keep the surrounding
buildings in tact?

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:27.485 position:50% align:center
This area's too narrow, I can't!

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.363 position:50% align:center
[EMELLA] Ugh, where did
this many even come from?

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:31.614 position:50% align:center
They're golem-like zombies

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:34.492 position:50% align:center
that are constructed out
of soil and vegetation.

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:37.370 position:50% align:center
We can destroy them,
but they'll come right back.

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:39.873 position:50% align:center
We'll need to figure out
a different solution.

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:43.793 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
That carriage.

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:47.464 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Garrett!

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:53.219 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Garrett! Wake up, you!

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:56.306 position:50% align:center
I gotta use the armored
jeep's flamethrower

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:59.392 position:50% align:center
to take out the zombies
in one fell swoop.

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:00.727 position:50% align:center
What are you saying?!

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.562 position:50% align:center
We don't have enough time
to retrieve that thing!

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:06.358 position:50% align:center
An angel?

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:10.236 position:50% align:center
Then does that mean I've
already died and gone to heaven?

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.865 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
It's me, you idiot!

00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:16.284 position:50% align:center
[GARRETT] Zombies usually
only appear at night,

00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:20.038 position:50% align:center
but these ones started showing
up in town just past noon.

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:22.248 position:50% align:center
And after a while,
the beast-like ones

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:25.001 position:50% align:center
appeared and began
attacking people.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:26.836 position:50% align:center
I assume you took action.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.589 position:50% align:center
[GARRETT] Yes, we've turned the
Warrior's Union into a shelter,

00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:32.133 position:50% align:center
and the Mage's union
into an infirmary.

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:34.344 position:50% align:center
Right now the zombies
are being held off

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:36.137 position:50% align:center
by Knight Patrol, adventurers,

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:38.848 position:50% align:center
and some residents
who know how to fight.

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:40.392 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
I see.

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:43.687 position:50% align:center
I'm on duty for the union, too.
So I'd better get going.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.188 position:50% align:center
'Scuse me.

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:47.148 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Oh, yes.

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:51.653 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:54.280 position:50% align:center
You know that guy?
You seemed familiar with him.

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:55.740 position:50% align:center
First time we've met.

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:59.285 position:50% align:center
Now, Tact, you stay here
with Emella for a while, okay?

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.829 position:50% align:center
[TACT]
What are you gonna do?

00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:01.913 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Hm.

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:15.218 position:50% align:center
A prayerless funeral procession,

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.971 position:50% align:center
an empty grave
marked by a sword.

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:20.557 position:50% align:center
The hands that guide descend.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.101 position:50% align:center
Oh, emissaries of heaven.

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:26.521 position:50% align:center
Maidens of war who
lead departed souls,

00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:28.982 position:50% align:center
that have left the
eternal cycle of life.

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:31.735 position:50% align:center
The clash of weapons
sound a requiem,

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:34.612 position:50% align:center
and build a rainbow
unto the heavens.

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:37.699 position:50% align:center
Crossing the night sky,
they descend!

00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:41.786 position:50% align:center
I call upon you,
oh choosers of the slain!

00:02:57.594 --> 00:02:59.012 position:50% align:center
We heed your call.

00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:01.931 position:50% align:center
These seven sisters
are at your command.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.017 position:50% align:center
Wonderful. I thank you.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.769 position:50% align:center
Alfina and I met earlier,

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:08.188 position:50% align:center
but I've not seen the
rest of you in a while.

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:10.106 position:50% align:center
Have you been well?

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.903 position:50% align:center
Yup! Except during
Alfina's training sessions!

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:17.280 position:50% align:center
Hey! Quiet, she'll hear you!

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:23.703 position:50% align:center
Thanks, but it's too late.
She heard me.

00:03:23.787 --> 00:03:26.539 position:50% align:center
[ALFINA] I am sorry that you
had to see such silly banter.

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:30.210 position:50% align:center
I will reprimand Christina
later, so please forgive us.

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:32.545 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
You're the same as ever, I see.

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:33.630 position:50% align:center
Does she speak the truth?

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:36.299 position:50% align:center
Is your training
really that grueling?

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:38.385 position:50% align:center
It's quite the
opposite, in fact.

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:42.305 position:50% align:center
Our training is easy, it's
simply repetition of the basics.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.849 position:50% align:center
Really? Well,
that's good to know.

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:49.187 position:50% align:center
She calls that easy?
She's crazy.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.188 position:50% align:center
I don't even wanna know

00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:52.524 position:50% align:center
what she thinks
hard training is.

00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:53.858 position:50% align:center
[CHRISTINA]
Wait!

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:56.945 position:50% align:center
But it's not easy to swing
a sword 100,000 times!

00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:58.113 position:50% align:center
She just said it.

00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:00.824 position:50% align:center
Man, I actually agree
with her for once.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:02.742 position:50% align:center
One hundred thousand times?

00:04:02.826 --> 00:04:05.120 position:50% align:center
Don't you think that's
a bit excessive?

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:08.331 position:50% align:center
[ALFINA] No! In fact, I believe
we're still lacking in skill!

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:09.749 position:50% align:center
If we're to be of
help to you, Master,

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:11.876 position:50% align:center
we must train even harder!

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:15.964 position:50% align:center
Now, Alfina.

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:19.342 position:50% align:center
Perhaps it would be best
to allow them to rest as well.

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:22.012 position:50% align:center
I can't know when I'll
call you in the future,

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.888 position:50% align:center
and if you're exhausted
from training,

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:27.767 position:50% align:center
then I can't expect you to be
ready at a moment's notice.

00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:29.144 position:50% align:center
[ALL sigh]

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:31.479 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! You may be right!

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:33.231 position:50% align:center
I'll review our
training regimen.

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:35.442 position:50% align:center
My deepest apologies, Master.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.655 position:50% align:center
All right. As you
may've guessed,

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:42.449 position:50% align:center
I was planning to have
you seven take care

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:44.868 position:50% align:center
of the zombies terrorizing
the town below.

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:46.286 position:50% align:center
Can you do it?

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:48.788 position:50% align:center
[ALFINA] Yes, but if
my sisters are tired...

00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:50.373 position:50% align:center
[CHRISTINA]
Leave it to us!

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:54.919 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Such spirit in serving
your master even when fatigued.

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:57.964 position:50% align:center
I of all people should--

00:04:58.048 --> 00:04:59.215 position:50% align:center
I will also help

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.634 position:50% align:center
so that I will not be
outdone by my sisters!

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:03.261 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Yeah!

00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:04.929 position:50% align:center
Not sure how that
improved morale,

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:07.265 position:50% align:center
but I'm in no
position to complain.

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:08.183 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:09.768 position:50% align:center
We know our mission!

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:13.855 position:50% align:center
[GROUP] We seven sisters shall
fight at the will of our master!

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:23.239 position:50% align:center
[CHRISTINA]
I'm here to help!

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:47.013 position:50% align:center
Master, there is
an urgent matter.

00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:49.891 position:50% align:center
Look up at the sky,
if you would.

00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:51.434 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Hm. What's that?

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:53.269 position:50% align:center
[ALFINA] Based on the
nature of its magic,

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.105 position:50% align:center
we believe it's a half-demon.

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:56.606 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
A half-demon.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.193 position:50% align:center
An ostensible abomination born
from a demon and a human.

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:02.612 position:50% align:center
Though it appears to be dead.

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:05.407 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] So we have a zombie
in the sky as well?

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.742 position:50% align:center
[ALFINA] The source is still
unknown, but we believe

00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:10.078 position:50% align:center
these zombies were created
by the unnatural mana

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.455 position:50% align:center
that's blanketing
the entire region.

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:16.710 position:50% align:center
Really? So is that
the mana, then?

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:19.004 position:50% align:center
Yes, and I believe
it can be applied

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:22.382 position:50% align:center
in a number of different ways.
Have we use of it?

00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:25.385 position:50% align:center
Not at the moment.
You may quell it.

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:26.678 position:50% align:center
[ALFINA]
Understood.

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:29.097 position:50% align:center
Now that I think about it,

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.725 position:50% align:center
I've fought with and defeated
a half-demon before.

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:33.935 position:50% align:center
Ah, you have?

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:37.230 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I wasn't very experienced
at the time, so I struggled.

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:40.400 position:50% align:center
But they're formidable foes
no matter your level.

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.193 position:50% align:center
[ALFINA]
Then let's not waste any time.

00:06:42.277 --> 00:06:45.363 position:50% align:center
We'll destroy him before
he's completely revived.

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:46.406 position:50% align:center
A good plan.

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:48.074 position:50% align:center
But he's not revived yet?

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:50.994 position:50% align:center
[ALFINA] No. And we will
keep it that way.

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:53.246 position:50% align:center
Okay. Very well.

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:54.831 position:50% align:center
On my honor.

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:58.918 position:50% align:center
But in order to do this, I do
have a request of you, Master.

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:01.546 position:50% align:center
Your permission to use
a new technique.

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:10.638 position:50% align:center
[ALFINA]
My sisters! The time is now!

00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:14.642 position:50% align:center
Let us unite our power
and end this!

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:47.258 position:50% align:center
[ALFINA]
Die, beast!

00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:04.526 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow!

00:08:04.609 --> 00:08:07.153 position:50% align:center
So that was "Imitation Code G"?

00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:19.165 position:50% align:center
[ALFINA] The half-demon and
magic in the surrounding area

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:21.251 position:50% align:center
have been completely excised.

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:26.006 position:50% align:center
Seems so. Good work out there.
That was a splendid technique.

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:28.675 position:50% align:center
We're honored by your praise.
It means the world.

00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:31.511 position:50% align:center
Now then, make sure
you rest up, okay?

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:36.266 position:50% align:center
[CHRISTINA]
Yay!

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.107 position:50% align:center
[TOWNSMAN 5A]
That one's moving!

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:50.989 position:50% align:center
Mo... ther...

00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:58.038 position:50% align:center
[EMELLA]
To a job well done!

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.834 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:05.420 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness!
We were so lucky today!

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:07.213 position:50% align:center
Everyone's safe and sound!

00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:08.840 position:50% align:center
Please, you're being dramatic.

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:10.175 position:50% align:center
Don't be so sure.

00:09:10.258 --> 00:09:12.177 position:50% align:center
We were givin' it
everything we've got.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.220 position:50% align:center
[FLICKER] None of us have
the power you do, Mira.

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:17.057 position:50% align:center
So worrying in a zombie
invasion is normal.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.683 position:50% align:center
Ah. That's a good point.

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:21.311 position:50% align:center
But seriously, your
summoning magic's awesome!

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:23.938 position:50% align:center
Ho-ho! Do I hear appreciation?

00:09:24.022 --> 00:09:25.648 position:50% align:center
I mean, with like
unlimited summons,

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:28.193 position:50% align:center
you can call those hot Valkyrie
ladies and be surrounded

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:30.403 position:50% align:center
by beautiful women all you want!

00:09:30.487 --> 00:09:33.406 position:50% align:center
That is not what summoning
magic is used for!

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.201 position:50% align:center
[TACT] Um. I've decided
I wanna learn to use magic

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:38.286 position:50% align:center
and become as strong
as you, Miss Mira!

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.081 position:50% align:center
That way, someday I can
help people out, too!

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:43.124 position:50% align:center
Oh, Tact.

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:45.043 position:50% align:center
[EMELLA] Then why don't you
head down to the Mage's Union

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:47.712 position:50% align:center
and see if you have the
aptitude to become a mage?

00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:49.881 position:50% align:center
They can measure
something like that?

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:52.050 position:50% align:center
[EMELLA] Yeah! But they're
probably closed for today.

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:53.093 position:50% align:center
Maybe tomorrow?

00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:53.968 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:55.637 position:50% align:center
Perfect timing.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.597 position:50% align:center
I'll be departing town tomorrow.

00:09:57.681 --> 00:10:00.558 position:50% align:center
But before I go, I'll get to see
the birth of a future summoner.

00:10:00.642 --> 00:10:02.727 position:50% align:center
There's no better
send off than that.

00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:04.229 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:07.607 position:50% align:center
[FLICKER] Mira, you're leaving?
Stay and be my baby girl!

00:10:07.691 --> 00:10:10.652 position:50% align:center
What do you mean "baby girl?"
What does that mean?

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:12.612 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL]
Ah, what energy.

00:10:12.696 --> 00:10:14.030 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Captain!

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:15.407 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL]
Good evening.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.743 position:50% align:center
I am the captain of the
Écarlate Carillon, Cyril.

00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:21.705 position:50% align:center
It seems a number our
members are indebted to you.

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:23.415 position:50% align:center
You have my thanks.

00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:26.126 position:50% align:center
Oh, please, you don't
have to thank me for it.

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:28.753 position:50% align:center
I had more fun with them than
I would have if I went alone.

00:10:28.837 --> 00:10:29.671 position:50% align:center
[FLICKER]
Mira!

00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:31.756 position:50% align:center
Hey! Not under the table!

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.092 position:50% align:center
Is it safe to assume
Flicker's been causing you

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:35.260 position:50% align:center
a bit of trouble?

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:37.762 position:50% align:center
A great deal,
and often just like this.

00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:39.514 position:50% align:center
I apologize for that.

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:41.599 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Oh, I don't mind... much.

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:42.851 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah!

00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:44.728 position:50% align:center
It's probably about time
we split up the loot.

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:49.065 position:50% align:center
Though, Mira beat almost all
the monsters by herself so...

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:51.568 position:50% align:center
I don't know that we deserve
to get an equal share of it.

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:54.112 position:50% align:center
My, there's a lot
here. How rare.

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:56.197 position:50% align:center
You've even got
mobility crystals.

00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:59.159 position:50% align:center
Can you believe Mira wants us
to divide this up evenly?

00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:01.077 position:50% align:center
Talk about generous, am I right?

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:05.331 position:50% align:center
I think we can distribute
the demon drops as well.

00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:08.585 position:50% align:center
Seriously? Are you sure
it's okay we take these?

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:09.753 position:50% align:center
Don't be silly.

00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:12.422 position:50% align:center
I like you all and
I want you to have some.

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:13.798 position:50% align:center
How do I put this?

00:11:13.882 --> 00:11:16.426 position:50% align:center
Just think of it as your
reward for all the good will

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:19.346 position:50% align:center
that you've fostered
since we've met.

00:11:19.429 --> 00:11:22.474 position:50% align:center
Now, that just leaves
this giant scythe.

00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:24.476 position:50% align:center
This thing is heavier than me!

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:27.979 position:50% align:center
And those dark knights
just swung these around?

00:11:28.063 --> 00:11:29.439 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:34.486 position:50% align:center
[ZEF]
Man, I drank a ton!

00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:35.862 position:50% align:center
By the way, Mira.

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:38.281 position:50% align:center
If I recall, you're
leaving tomorrow, right?

00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:40.241 position:50% align:center
Allow me to see you off.

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:42.118 position:50% align:center
There's no need for that.

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:43.453 position:50% align:center
Come now.

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:44.996 position:50% align:center
There's something I'd
like to talk to you about,

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.124 position:50% align:center
so if you're able, I'd like
to at least treat you to lunch.

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:49.626 position:50% align:center
I know a good place.

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:50.877 position:50% align:center
I'll be there.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.837 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL]
Great. Until tomorrow.

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:58.009 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
That man. Could he be...?

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:05.016 position:50% align:center
We thank you!
You're oh so kind!

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.434 position:50% align:center
What am I looking at?

00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:08.520 position:50% align:center
[EURICA]
I've been waiting for you, Mira.

00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:11.731 position:50% align:center
Ah. This one wants
to be a summoner.

00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:14.192 position:50% align:center
We were hoping you could
check his aptitude for it.

00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:16.069 position:50% align:center
I'd appreciate it a lot!

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:18.822 position:50% align:center
Sure! I'll take care
of that right away.

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:20.365 position:50% align:center
Perfect, thanks.

00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:22.992 position:50% align:center
I'll be outside. I have
something to attend to.

00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:32.002 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Dates? Also,
Solomon's showy signature.

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:36.464 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
May 12th, 2146.

00:12:36.548 --> 00:12:38.675 position:50% align:center
The document I had to fill in
when registering as an

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:41.344 position:50% align:center
adventurer said May 19th,
but that checks out

00:12:41.428 --> 00:12:45.140 position:50% align:center
since it's been about a week
since I came to this world.

00:12:45.223 --> 00:12:47.225 position:50% align:center
The D must stand
for "Danblf."

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:50.353 position:50% align:center
So the other letters are
likely Flonne, Luminaria,

00:12:50.437 --> 00:12:52.856 position:50% align:center
Kagura and Artesia.

00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:56.317 position:50% align:center
And since Solomon told me
he checked his Friends List

00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:59.696 position:50% align:center
every day, then that must mean
that the names of the Wise Men

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:00.822 position:50% align:center
that aren't indicated here

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:03.742 position:50% align:center
arrived in this
world before he did.

00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:06.411 position:50% align:center
But why did this information
have to be coded?

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:08.288 position:50% align:center
Solomon could've told
me himself, but no,

00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:10.832 position:50% align:center
he had to be all
sneaky about it.

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:11.958 position:50% align:center
[TACT]
Miss Mira.

00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:15.128 position:50% align:center
Huh? Ah, did you get
the test results?

00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:18.715 position:50% align:center
Yup, Tact's mage aptitude
report is right here!

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:21.009 position:50% align:center
He has the potential to
become a great sorcerer,

00:13:21.092 --> 00:13:22.761 position:50% align:center
priest, or diviner.

00:13:22.844 --> 00:13:25.180 position:50% align:center
I also measured his capacity
for magic in general,

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:26.890 position:50% align:center
and it was far above average.

00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:28.975 position:50% align:center
Tact has a promising future.

00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:31.144 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Yes, but not as a summoner.

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:32.479 position:50% align:center
[TACT]
How'd I do?

00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:34.522 position:50% align:center
Will I be able to get
as strong as you someday?

00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:36.024 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh!

00:13:36.107 --> 00:13:39.152 position:50% align:center
Work hard, and I'm certain that
you'll become a fine mage.

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:41.905 position:50% align:center
When you do, let us
adventure together!

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:43.281 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:49.204 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I'm sure we'll
meet again someday.

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:56.878 position:50% align:center
You're kidding me!
I can just buy this?

00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:59.130 position:50% align:center
I won't need any more
of those frilly outfits

00:13:59.214 --> 00:14:02.008 position:50% align:center
if I have the perfect
replacement robe!

00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:05.053 position:50% align:center
Hm. Where shall
we begin this chat?

00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:07.639 position:50% align:center
I know you don't
have very much time.

00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:11.309 position:50% align:center
So if you don't mind, let's
jump straight to the meta talk.

00:14:11.393 --> 00:14:15.480 position:50% align:center
Ah. It's as I suspected.
You're a former player, too.

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:16.731 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL]
Yes.

00:14:16.815 --> 00:14:18.566 position:50% align:center
I imagine we were using
the "Inspect" function

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.444 position:50% align:center
on each other at roughly
the same time yesterday.

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:22.737 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL]
Probably.

00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:24.572 position:50% align:center
After all, it's the first
thing a player does

00:14:24.656 --> 00:14:27.867 position:50% align:center
when they stumble across
someone extraordinary.

00:14:27.951 --> 00:14:29.577 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
That's true.

00:14:29.661 --> 00:14:32.122 position:50% align:center
Anyway. How long have
you been in this world?

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:33.748 position:50% align:center
If you don't mind me asking.

00:14:33.832 --> 00:14:35.333 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Just a week so far.

00:14:35.417 --> 00:14:38.586 position:50% align:center
Only that long? You're
quite calm, considering.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.548 position:50% align:center
Why, a week in, I was still
desperately looking for a way

00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:44.509 position:50% align:center
to return to the original world.

00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:46.469 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] If I hadn't found
my comrade early on,

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:48.304 position:50% align:center
I would've been the same way.

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:50.682 position:50% align:center
I have him to thank.

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:53.977 position:50% align:center
So, uh. You're Danblf, right?

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.228 position:50% align:center
Correct.

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:58.356 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.109 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Though now, I've become
said comrade's errand boy.

00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:02.527 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL]
I'm jealous.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.655 position:50% align:center
I wish I had run into a friend
as quickly as you did.

00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:08.700 position:50% align:center
It took me a whole year,
and I had gone through a lot.

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:10.285 position:50% align:center
That's a long time.

00:15:10.368 --> 00:15:13.246 position:50% align:center
I happened to wake up a short
trip from where my ally lives,

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:15.331 position:50% align:center
so I made my way straight there.

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:17.417 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
I was quite lucky.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.002 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL]
Oh, that reminds me.

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:21.296 position:50% align:center
I hear you're Danblf's pupil.

00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:22.839 position:50% align:center
I had never heard
of the Wise Men

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:24.758 position:50% align:center
taking on apprentices before.

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:27.635 position:50% align:center
Could it be you're
his real life friend?

00:15:27.719 --> 00:15:28.928 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Who is this man?

00:15:29.012 --> 00:15:30.472 position:50% align:center
His intuition is uncanny!

00:15:30.555 --> 00:15:32.932 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL] Though Emella's story of
your adventures painted you

00:15:33.016 --> 00:15:35.852 position:50% align:center
quite similarly to what
I've heard about Danblf.

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:37.937 position:50% align:center
So, I suppose
anything is possible;

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:39.981 position:50% align:center
you could be Danblf himself.

00:15:40.065 --> 00:15:42.192 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
He--He saw right through me!

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:43.693 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
He's a real life friend!

00:15:43.777 --> 00:15:45.278 position:50% align:center
He and I always
played independently

00:15:45.362 --> 00:15:48.615 position:50% align:center
of each other though, so you
wouldn't have heard of me!

00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:50.992 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Did I fool him? Did I?

00:15:51.076 --> 00:15:53.495 position:50% align:center
Ah, I see. That
certainly explains it!

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:57.540 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
I fooled him!

00:15:57.624 --> 00:15:59.584 position:50% align:center
We've done plenty
of talking about me.

00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:04.464 position:50% align:center
Why don't you tell me
about yourself in return?

00:16:04.547 --> 00:16:07.634 position:50% align:center
I arrived in this world
ten days after the "First Day."

00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:09.552 position:50% align:center
So there's a "First Day."

00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:10.762 position:50% align:center
Go on.

00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:12.263 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL]
I'll never forget.

00:16:12.347 --> 00:16:15.100 position:50% align:center
It was raining, and I had
no idea where I was

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:20.230 position:50% align:center
but I saved a widow with a
baby from a group of goblins.

00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:21.439 position:50% align:center
Watch out!

00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:28.571 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL]
What? It hurt? How?

00:16:28.655 --> 00:16:30.240 position:50% align:center
And that's not all.

00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:34.077 position:50% align:center
What is this?
I can smell the grass.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.705 position:50% align:center
I can feel my hair
sticking to me.

00:16:36.788 --> 00:16:41.418 position:50% align:center
And, coming from my palm,
the warmth of my blood.

00:16:46.214 --> 00:16:48.800 position:50% align:center
[HANNA] Um. Thank you
for helping us, sir.

00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:50.677 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you run away
when you could?

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.347 position:50% align:center
--[gasps]
--[BOY 5A cries]

00:16:54.431 --> 00:16:56.433 position:50% align:center
[HANNA]
It's okay now.

00:16:56.516 --> 00:16:59.728 position:50% align:center
Did I miss an update that
let players have babies?

00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:02.731 position:50% align:center
An NPC? But how?

00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:05.150 position:50% align:center
Hanna had a husband,

00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:08.319 position:50% align:center
but he died from a rainy
goblin's poison dart.

00:17:08.403 --> 00:17:09.779 position:50% align:center
To make matters worse,

00:17:09.863 --> 00:17:13.116 position:50% align:center
the goblins also made it
difficult to harvest any crops.

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:15.535 position:50% align:center
She was struggling to
raise her child alone.

00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:18.663 position:50% align:center
And who could blame her?

00:17:18.747 --> 00:17:22.500 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL]
What is this? What's going on?

00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:24.336 position:50% align:center
I can't even logout.

00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:29.883 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL] And it says everyone
on my Friends List is offline.

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:32.719 position:50% align:center
They just look like
a mother and child.

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:34.054 position:50% align:center
They don't act like NPCs

00:17:34.137 --> 00:17:36.848 position:50% align:center
following the
script from a game.

00:17:36.931 --> 00:17:39.392 position:50% align:center
I went to a shop in town
to heal my wound,

00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:41.478 position:50% align:center
but there was no
medicine available.

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:42.687 position:50% align:center
And I found out a trader

00:17:42.771 --> 00:17:45.899 position:50% align:center
would be coming from
the Kingdom of Alcait.

00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:49.527 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL] Alcait!
That's Solomon's kingdom!

00:17:49.611 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL] If Solomon is here
and still has the throne,

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:56.159 position:50% align:center
I should be able to track him
down and ask what's going on.

00:17:56.242 --> 00:17:59.662 position:50% align:center
I couldn't find anyone who
knew how to make medicine.

00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:02.707 position:50% align:center
However, since I was able
to converse with the NPCs

00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:05.293 position:50% align:center
like real people now,
there was no reason

00:18:05.377 --> 00:18:07.796 position:50% align:center
they wouldn't be able
to learn eventually.

00:18:07.879 --> 00:18:10.757 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL] Hanna, may I
buy some herbs from you?

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.801 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! I couldn't
possibly take money

00:18:12.884 --> 00:18:14.678 position:50% align:center
from the person
who saved my life!

00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:18.223 position:50% align:center
You won't. I'll teach
you an invaluable skill.

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:21.976 position:50% align:center
One for you,
and for the village.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.561 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL]
I passed on what I already knew

00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:24.854 position:50% align:center
of medicine to Hanna,

00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:28.608 position:50% align:center
while deepening my own
knowledge of the subject.

00:18:28.692 --> 00:18:32.570 position:50% align:center
Then at full strength, I
eradicated the rainy goblins,

00:18:32.654 --> 00:18:34.989 position:50% align:center
And taught the villagers
the basics of self-defense

00:18:35.073 --> 00:18:37.534 position:50% align:center
in the process.

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:39.536 position:50% align:center
I also touched on
business and taught them

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:42.330 position:50% align:center
every negotiation skill I knew.

00:18:42.414 --> 00:18:46.459 position:50% align:center
I helped the village
become independent.

00:18:46.543 --> 00:18:49.045 position:50% align:center
And then took my leave.

00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:50.964 position:50% align:center
Thank you for everything!

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:54.175 position:50% align:center
[CYRIL] You know, that
could've been a sob story

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:57.595 position:50% align:center
but somehow, I feel like
I had fun in the end.

00:18:57.679 --> 00:18:59.431 position:50% align:center
Even in a crisis.

00:18:59.514 --> 00:19:00.932 position:50% align:center
You felt so, too?

00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:03.268 position:50% align:center
To think we'd experience
the excitement of starting

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:06.062 position:50% align:center
the game again, after
all our time with it.

00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:08.690 position:50% align:center
Soon after, I found
myself in a big city

00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:12.318 position:50% align:center
and reunited with some friends
at the Adventurer's Union there.

00:19:12.402 --> 00:19:14.863 position:50% align:center
A lot of people helped
me get my bearings.

00:19:14.946 --> 00:19:17.365 position:50% align:center
Eventually, there were
enough people I clicked with,

00:19:17.449 --> 00:19:20.702 position:50% align:center
so I decided to start
a guild with them.

00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:21.953 position:50% align:center
With that said,

00:19:22.037 --> 00:19:23.496 position:50% align:center
what we can
accomplish is limited

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.082 position:50% align:center
by our relatively small reach.

00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:28.460 position:50% align:center
We've tried to do a lot
for this world before,

00:19:28.543 --> 00:19:30.253 position:50% align:center
but we weren't able.

00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:34.215 position:50% align:center
We want to learn all about this
world and help those in it.

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:36.343 position:50% align:center
Miss Mira, won't you
join my guild

00:19:36.426 --> 00:19:38.219 position:50% align:center
and aid us in our quest?

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.265 position:50% align:center
My apologies.

00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:45.435 position:50% align:center
I may not look it, but I have
quite the busy schedule.

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:47.979 position:50% align:center
I'm not in a position
to join a group right now.

00:19:48.063 --> 00:19:49.564 position:50% align:center
That's no surprise.

00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:51.566 position:50% align:center
I figured there was
no harm in asking,

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:54.361 position:50% align:center
but I had a feeling that
you wouldn't say yes.

00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:56.154 position:50% align:center
Although, if I hear
a call for help

00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:59.282 position:50% align:center
from your direction, I'll do
my best to respond to it.

00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:00.617 position:50% align:center
How does that sound?

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.328 position:50% align:center
Great. Thank you very much.

00:20:03.411 --> 00:20:07.874 position:50% align:center
Can I do something for you?

00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:10.502 position:50% align:center
Actually, you could
look into this.

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:13.880 position:50% align:center
[EMELLA]
I totally called it!

00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:18.551 position:50% align:center
You did know that soldier that
crashed his carriage yesterday!

00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:20.929 position:50% align:center
[FLICKER]
Take me with you!

00:20:21.012 --> 00:20:22.430 position:50% align:center
[EMELLA]
Stop that!

00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:28.728 position:50% align:center
[MIRA giggles]
I got far more souvenirs

00:20:28.812 --> 00:20:30.063 position:50% align:center
than I would've expected.

00:20:30.146 --> 00:20:34.317 position:50% align:center
A meat burger from Asval,
and bean tea from Zef.

00:20:37.862 --> 00:20:41.157 position:50% align:center
Looks like a thank you
letter from Tact.

00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:45.036 position:50% align:center
Adorable, and some kind
of letter from Flicker.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.914 position:50% align:center
Oh, boy, that's a lot of pages.

00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:50.667 position:50% align:center
And finally,
a novel from Emella.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:54.879 position:50% align:center
<i>Danblf Romancing Adventure:</i>
<i>Mysterious Saga</i> ?

00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:56.006 position:50% align:center
Wait!

00:20:56.089 --> 00:20:58.758 position:50% align:center
Is this some weird
novelization of me?

00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:03.805 position:50% align:center
We've been awaiting
your arrival.

00:21:03.888 --> 00:21:05.265 position:50% align:center
Have you?

00:21:07.684 --> 00:21:08.852 position:50% align:center
[SULEIMAN]
This way.

00:21:11.312 --> 00:21:15.567 position:50% align:center
How do you like my robe?
Have I not been reborn?

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:16.735 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:21:16.818 --> 00:21:18.862 position:50% align:center
And I cleared the
request you asked of me.

00:21:18.945 --> 00:21:21.573 position:50% align:center
Perfect. And, uh,
that robe suits you.

00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:22.741 position:50% align:center
Really.

00:21:24.284 --> 00:21:25.493 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
I've returned!

00:21:25.577 --> 00:21:27.245 position:50% align:center
[CLEOS]
Welcome back.

00:21:27.328 --> 00:21:29.372 position:50% align:center
Miss Mira. That attire
you've donned...

00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:33.084 position:50% align:center
You noticed! It looks good, no?

00:21:33.168 --> 00:21:35.503 position:50% align:center
Speaking of clothing,
why an apron?

00:21:35.587 --> 00:21:37.213 position:50% align:center
Well, you see...

00:21:39.674 --> 00:21:42.260 position:50% align:center
[CLEOS] When you left without a
word, it came as quite the shock

00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:45.764 position:50% align:center
to Mariana, and she's been
in a bit of a mood.

00:21:45.847 --> 00:21:47.807 position:50% align:center
So I've been helping
out with her work.

00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:49.768 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Ah. I see.

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:55.815 position:50% align:center
Miss Mira! Welcome back!
Oh, that robe!

00:21:55.899 --> 00:21:57.817 position:50% align:center
What do you think?
Pretty nice, right?

00:21:57.901 --> 00:21:59.361 position:50% align:center
Of course! The
replicas they make

00:21:59.444 --> 00:22:01.613 position:50% align:center
of Master Danblf's
robe are so cute.

00:22:01.696 --> 00:22:04.407 position:50% align:center
Kids love them!

00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:07.660 position:50% align:center
This is a replica for children?

00:22:09.412 --> 00:22:12.957 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA, CLEOS chuckling]

00:22:16.294 --> 00:22:19.130 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] That's why
everyone was laughing!
