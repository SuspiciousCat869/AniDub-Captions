WEBVTT

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.041
Oh, by the way, Zef.

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:21.667
How are you feeling
after going through that?

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.166
[gasps] I'm fine! Don't worry!

00:00:30.041 --> 00:00:31.750
[MIRA]
I'm happy for you.

00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:41.208
[ZEF]
Thanks.

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:43.959
[MIRA] Now. Since I've
already come so far,

00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:46.959
would you lot mind bringing
Tact back to town on your own?

00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:48.625
There's something I still
need to take care of

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:50.083
on the sixth level.

00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:53.166
The sixth level?
I feel like I was told

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.500
there's some big castle
or temple down there.

00:00:55.583 --> 00:00:57.250
Am I making that up?

00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.500
No, you're not.

00:00:58.583 --> 00:01:00.625
I'm heading to said castle.

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:02.875
But thousands of people have
gone exploring down there

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:06.917
already and word is, none of
them found anything worthwhile.

00:01:08.792 --> 00:01:10.166
Hey, Mira, um...

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.875
Do you think it'd be okay
if we stuck with you?

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:14.125
[ZEF]
Yeah, can we?

00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:16.458
If it were anyone else,
I'd call 'em crazy,

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:18.917
but if you've got
business there, I wanna go.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.417
Reconsider!

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.875
There's no telling what danger
may be lurking down below.

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:25.792
[ASVAL] Hah! Honestly, there's
nowhere safer in this dungeon

00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:27.917
than by your side, little miss.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.291
I wanna see it, too!

00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:30.542
[FLICKER]
Agreed!

00:01:30.625 --> 00:01:33.667
I mean, I'd follow you
anywhere you go, Mira!

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.208
You're all very strange.

00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:39.333
[MIRA] Well, in truth,
I'd like to spend

00:01:39.417 --> 00:01:42.000
a little more time
with these folks, so...

00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:47.375
[sighs] Follow me.

00:01:50.583 --> 00:01:53.208
You must not stray from my side.

00:03:31.625 --> 00:03:32.959
[EMELLA]
That reminds me, Mira.

00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:36.333
You mentioned a "Howard"
earlier, didn't you?

00:03:36.417 --> 00:03:37.667
Hey, Howard!

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.458
Look, it's the holy water
that you loved so much!

00:03:44.417 --> 00:03:46.041
An old acquaintance of mine.

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:48.125
I wanted to ask him something,

00:03:48.208 --> 00:03:50.959
but it seems our
bond was lacking.

00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:53.500
Is he by any chance
an older gentleman

00:03:53.583 --> 00:03:56.583
who always wore a trench coat
and a flat-top hat?

00:03:59.041 --> 00:04:01.375
By the stars,
that's precisely the one.

00:04:01.458 --> 00:04:02.542
That's what I thought.

00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:04.875
I had a feeling you were
talking about him.

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.250
[MIRA] So you know that
self-proclaimed demon expert?

00:04:08.333 --> 00:04:11.333
[EMELLA] I wouldn't say I know
him, but a long time ago,

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:12.458
in the Lion King's Lair,

00:04:12.542 --> 00:04:16.000
he randomly splashed
holy water on me.

00:04:16.083 --> 00:04:17.375
[MIRA]
You as well?

00:04:17.458 --> 00:04:20.875
He certainly did that to anyone
and everyone he could.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.583
And that's the guy
you wanted to see, is he?

00:04:24.667 --> 00:04:27.125
Oh. Just a hunch, but any chance

00:04:27.208 --> 00:04:30.750
it's related to the recent
appearance of that Lesser Demon?

00:04:30.834 --> 00:04:34.291
Very astute.
I won't say it's not.

00:04:34.375 --> 00:04:36.583
[FLICKER] Speaking of, I heard
a Lesser Demon's shown up

00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:38.625
near Alcait recently, too.

00:04:38.709 --> 00:04:39.500
[MIRA]
"Too?"

00:04:39.583 --> 00:04:41.375
It's appeared elsewhere?

00:04:41.458 --> 00:04:43.875
[FLICKER] Yeah, in the last
week alone, demon sightings

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:47.250
have been reported in
two other kingdoms as well.

00:04:47.333 --> 00:04:48.834
[FLICKER] I'm willing
to bet they'll issue

00:04:48.917 --> 00:04:52.291
an advisory warning about it
to all adventurers soon.

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:54.834
[MIRA]
Interesting.

00:04:54.917 --> 00:04:56.208
[MIRA]
This makes it even less likely

00:04:56.291 --> 00:04:58.291
that the appearances are random.

00:04:58.375 --> 00:05:00.667
There must be some
objective behind it.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.667
[gasps]

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.709
Something wrong? You okay?

00:05:03.792 --> 00:05:06.542
Oh, it's nothing.

00:05:06.625 --> 00:05:09.959
[MIRA]
Perfect. The call of nature.

00:05:10.041 --> 00:05:12.625
It's Mira's holy water.

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:14.458
What I wouldn't give
to get a hold of that!

00:05:14.542 --> 00:05:18.917
I gotta... I gotta
have her holy water!

00:05:21.417 --> 00:05:24.125
[MIRA]
I need to have a bit of privacy.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.875
[ZEF]
All right. Guess we've arrived.

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:31.917
[ASVAL]
Ooh, so this is it.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.500
I'd heard stories, but this
place is really somethin'.

00:05:35.583 --> 00:05:36.792
[EMELLA]
You can say that again.

00:05:36.875 --> 00:05:38.333
It's so massive,
it's hard to believe

00:05:38.417 --> 00:05:42.000
we're deep underground here.

00:05:42.083 --> 00:05:44.041
[FLICKER]
Hey, Mira! Wait!

00:05:47.834 --> 00:05:50.625
Oh, wow. The inside's big, too!

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:54.375
[ZEF] Yeah, but there's also
a whole lotta nothin' here.

00:05:54.458 --> 00:05:55.625
Hey, Mira.

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:58.500
What on earth did you
come to this place for?

00:06:09.041 --> 00:06:11.417
[EMELLA]
A hidden door!

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.583
[ZEF] Man, considering
how well it was hidden,

00:06:14.667 --> 00:06:17.417
I guess it's no wonder no one
else noticed it before.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.166
And yet, with one look,
she saw it.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.917
Mira really is incredible!

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.917
This is as far as you go.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.959
I'll be proceeding alone from
here on out, understand?

00:06:27.041 --> 00:06:29.542
I'm on somewhat
of a secret errand.

00:06:29.625 --> 00:06:31.667
Oh. Well, that's a shame.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.542
If you say so, fine.

00:06:33.625 --> 00:06:37.417
Oh, so Mira's got a secret.
Wonder what that could be--

00:06:41.375 --> 00:06:43.291
Why don't you keep
an eye on Tact for me?

00:06:43.375 --> 00:06:46.166
Uh. Okay. I'm on it.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.500
I'll see ya later.

00:06:47.583 --> 00:06:49.083
Be careful!

00:06:49.166 --> 00:06:51.208
Yes. I'm off.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.375
[screams] I'd better
move quickly--

00:06:59.458 --> 00:07:02.959
I played it cool for too long!

00:07:03.041 --> 00:07:04.291
There it is!

00:07:08.291 --> 00:07:12.500
This is awkward, but you
can't fight necessity.

00:07:17.166 --> 00:07:18.375
[sighs]

00:07:21.667 --> 00:07:22.959
[sighs]

00:07:26.667 --> 00:07:31.417
[sighs] The Immortal Arts:
Biometric Scan.

00:07:33.583 --> 00:07:34.917
Would you look at that?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.709
They're all being good
and staying put.

00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:40.417
Now let's see.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.959
It doesn't look like
there are any readings

00:07:42.041 --> 00:07:44.291
that could be Soul Howl yet.

00:07:44.375 --> 00:07:48.500
Seems I'll have to venture
to the final floor after all.

00:07:48.583 --> 00:07:50.041
Ugh.

00:08:00.375 --> 00:08:03.125
[MIRA]
There's one. But that's strange.

00:08:03.208 --> 00:08:06.250
It's awfully weak to be him.

00:08:06.333 --> 00:08:07.875
Could it be...?

00:08:13.667 --> 00:08:16.417
[MIRA]
The throne room. Huh.

00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:22.291
[gasps]

00:08:24.667 --> 00:08:27.333
[MIRA]
No signs of life.

00:08:27.417 --> 00:08:30.125
Soul Howl's deplorable,
and he's only become worse

00:08:30.208 --> 00:08:32.458
in my 30-year absence.

00:08:32.542 --> 00:08:34.333
Although...

00:08:34.417 --> 00:08:37.750
There was that one life
reading detected in here.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.792
[MIRA gasps]
So cold.

00:08:44.875 --> 00:08:47.333
But she isn't actually dead.

00:08:47.417 --> 00:08:50.834
Then she must be the one I was
picking up on this floor.

00:08:50.917 --> 00:08:53.917
Why is she the only
one still alive?

00:08:55.709 --> 00:08:58.959
Hey, Soul Howl!
Are you not here?

00:09:00.417 --> 00:09:02.333
That eccentric.

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:04.333
What the hell is he thinking?

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.375
[MIRA]
Oh. His research laboratory?

00:09:12.458 --> 00:09:13.917
Ah-hah.

00:09:15.667 --> 00:09:18.125
My, this works out perfectly!

00:09:18.208 --> 00:09:19.417
For as long as
I've known the man,

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.375
I could never understand
his unique proclivities.

00:09:23.458 --> 00:09:25.166
But there's one thing
we do have in common,

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.583
and that's our taste in clothes.

00:09:28.667 --> 00:09:30.166
[MIRA]
He has so many.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:33.417
My pilfering an outfit or two
shouldn't cause any problems.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.041
No good.

00:09:39.125 --> 00:09:42.041
I should've expected
they'd all be far too big.

00:09:42.125 --> 00:09:43.542
Oh, well!

00:09:45.333 --> 00:09:49.458
[MIRA] Oh. Well, it's a bit
short for my tastes.

00:09:51.417 --> 00:09:53.166
I could certainly
never dress like this,

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.500
it would obliterate
my dignity.

00:09:55.583 --> 00:09:59.875
Worth a shot. There's
nothing here to take.

00:09:59.959 --> 00:10:01.083
Oh, wow!

00:10:01.166 --> 00:10:03.750
These are invaluable!

00:10:03.834 --> 00:10:05.792
I couldn't bear to
see them wither away

00:10:05.875 --> 00:10:07.166
in a place like this!

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:10.667
I'll just have to borrow
them for a short while.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:11.875
Isn't that...

00:10:11.959 --> 00:10:14.750
...the Holy Grail
of Heavenly Light?

00:10:14.834 --> 00:10:17.250
It's a legendary item
that heals any wound

00:10:17.333 --> 00:10:19.583
and helps cure
any status effect.

00:10:19.667 --> 00:10:23.959
It's even said to be powerful
enough to resurrect the dead.

00:10:26.834 --> 00:10:29.834
[MIRA] Apologies.
I need to see your back.

00:10:31.041 --> 00:10:35.041
[MIRA]
I thought so. Devil's Blessing.

00:10:35.125 --> 00:10:37.291
So that's what he's doing.

00:10:37.375 --> 00:10:40.959
Soul Howl used necromancy to
effectively stop time for her,

00:10:41.041 --> 00:10:43.208
to pause the
progression of a curse.

00:10:43.291 --> 00:10:44.834
And that's buying
him time to obtain

00:10:44.917 --> 00:10:49.792
the Holy Grail of Heavenly
Light to cure her.

00:10:49.875 --> 00:10:53.709
I see. It's hard to
believe he'd do that.

00:10:57.417 --> 00:11:00.041
[DANBLF]
There's no saving that girl now.

00:11:00.125 --> 00:11:03.750
Won't you leave her be and
allow her family to mourn?

00:11:03.834 --> 00:11:05.458
[SOUL HOWL]
Think, old one.

00:11:05.542 --> 00:11:08.750
To bury a beautiful woman and
return her body to the soil

00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:10.583
would be a crime against nature.

00:11:10.667 --> 00:11:13.125
I'll take her and begin
the embalming process

00:11:13.208 --> 00:11:15.500
and store her with
the utmost care.

00:11:15.583 --> 00:11:18.834
Thus her beauty will be
eternally preserved.

00:11:18.917 --> 00:11:22.500
Never to be touched
or tarnished by aging.

00:11:22.583 --> 00:11:25.375
She will shine from now
to the end of time.

00:11:27.583 --> 00:11:29.291
[MIRA]
To think that sick bastard

00:11:29.375 --> 00:11:32.458
would go to these lengths
for a woman who's still alive.

00:11:32.542 --> 00:11:36.125
I suppose that means he's done
some positive growing, too.

00:11:45.375 --> 00:11:47.709
[MIRA]
Hm? What's going on?

00:11:47.792 --> 00:11:49.291
They all right?

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:51.166
[ZEF]
Oh, hey, glad you're safe!

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.834
Welcome back,
Miss Mira, how was it?

00:11:53.917 --> 00:11:57.500
No trouble. I trust
you behaved yourself.

00:11:57.583 --> 00:11:59.542
So, what's wrong with the girls?

00:11:59.625 --> 00:12:01.834
Mira! What is this place?

00:12:01.917 --> 00:12:04.041
I thought there wasn't supposed
to be anything here!

00:12:04.125 --> 00:12:08.709
There're so many dead maids!
I can't even count them all!

00:12:08.792 --> 00:12:10.500
[MIRA]
Honestly.

00:12:10.583 --> 00:12:13.917
He had even more of them
hidden out here?

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.250
Come on, Soul Howl.

00:12:15.333 --> 00:12:18.500
Must you be such an
unbelievably twisted person?

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.542
[ZEF] Huh? Did anyone else
hear something move?

00:12:23.625 --> 00:12:25.542
[ASVAL]
Eh, it was probably nothin'.

00:12:25.625 --> 00:12:27.458
You said it yourself,
tons of adventurers

00:12:27.542 --> 00:12:29.709
have explored down here.

00:12:29.792 --> 00:12:32.709
And there was nothing around,
including monsters.

00:12:32.792 --> 00:12:36.333
No, wait. There's
definitely something!

00:12:38.709 --> 00:12:39.875
[MIRA]
Watch out!

00:12:43.917 --> 00:12:45.083
[ZEF]
A demon?

00:12:45.166 --> 00:12:47.542
[FLICKER]
No way!

00:12:47.625 --> 00:12:49.083
[WOLF BANE]
Ooh.

00:12:49.166 --> 00:12:52.375
I didn't expect to see
people in such a place.

00:12:52.458 --> 00:12:54.166
But what good fortune.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.959
You six will make
a fine offering.

00:12:57.041 --> 00:12:59.875
Young Tact. Go hide
for a little while.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.166
[MIRA] Hm, so he's
a third-ranked count.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:09.333
What do you say, team?
Think you can fight him?

00:13:09.417 --> 00:13:11.333
[ASVAL] If you mean
"as equals" then no,

00:13:11.417 --> 00:13:13.041
that's probably not happening.

00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:17.125
But if we're willing to make
some sacrifices, then maybe.

00:13:17.208 --> 00:13:19.583
Understood. In that case...

00:13:19.667 --> 00:13:23.041
You all go hide as well.
I'll deal with this myself.

00:13:23.125 --> 00:13:24.792
[EMELLA]
But the other guy's a demon!

00:13:24.875 --> 00:13:27.458
I admit you're skilled,
but you can't take him alone!

00:13:27.542 --> 00:13:29.041
[ASVAL] If you're gonna
summon that Valkyrie,

00:13:29.125 --> 00:13:32.333
we can at least buy you time.
That sound like a plan to you?

00:13:32.417 --> 00:13:33.917
Sorry, but I don't
think even that

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.625
would be enough to do it!

00:13:48.792 --> 00:13:51.208
[ZEF] Guys! Let's do
as she says and go!

00:13:51.291 --> 00:13:52.500
Are you sure?

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.208
Think of it this way,
if it helps.

00:13:55.291 --> 00:13:57.291
She can't go all out
if we're here!

00:14:02.792 --> 00:14:04.417
Nah, couldn't be.

00:14:05.458 --> 00:14:08.709
[WOLF BANE] My, you actually
parried a blow from my scythe.

00:14:08.792 --> 00:14:10.792
In respect for your skill,

00:14:10.875 --> 00:14:14.291
perhaps I will grant
you an introduction.

00:14:14.375 --> 00:14:20.208
My name is Wolf Bane.
Soul Taker of Valnares.

00:14:20.291 --> 00:14:21.750
I am Mira.

00:14:21.834 --> 00:14:24.542
And as you can see,
I am a summoner.

00:14:24.625 --> 00:14:28.792
[WOLF BANE laughs]
A summoner, eh?

00:14:28.875 --> 00:14:30.542
You mean to say,

00:14:30.625 --> 00:14:34.083
if I cut down this knight,
that will be the end?

00:14:40.083 --> 00:14:41.583
[gasps]

00:14:41.667 --> 00:14:44.125
[WOLF BANE] Now there is no one
left to protect the princess.

00:14:44.208 --> 00:14:45.375
Mira!

00:14:45.458 --> 00:14:47.417
[WOLF BANE yells]

00:14:49.458 --> 00:14:50.834
[MIRA]
Heh.

00:14:54.083 --> 00:14:55.917
[WOLF BANE yelps]

00:14:57.583 --> 00:15:00.458
Okay. Obviously my
reach is shorter,

00:15:00.542 --> 00:15:04.000
but it's also easier for me
to slip into the enemy's space.

00:15:04.083 --> 00:15:06.000
This will be my first
close-quarters fight

00:15:06.083 --> 00:15:09.125
in this form, but I
think I'll manage.

00:15:09.208 --> 00:15:11.792
[WOLF BANE] What the hell?
What did you do?

00:15:11.875 --> 00:15:13.792
It was but a mere love tap.

00:15:13.875 --> 00:15:16.792
Nothing to get so
upset about, you brat.

00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:19.166
Am I crazy?
Or was that just...

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.667
Immortal Arts?

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:23.709
[WOLF BANE]
Don't get so cocky, little girl!

00:15:28.667 --> 00:15:30.125
[MIRA]
Back when this was a game,

00:15:30.208 --> 00:15:33.417
I couldn't sense things like
the flow of air as he strikes.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.917
But now...!

00:15:38.667 --> 00:15:40.083
You have my gratitude.

00:15:40.166 --> 00:15:43.125
I'm getting back into the
swing of things, thanks to you.

00:15:43.208 --> 00:15:46.041
[WOLF BANE]
You impertinent little wretch!

00:15:57.166 --> 00:15:59.417
[groans]

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:04.333
[MIRA] As I suspected, only
spells do any real damage.

00:16:04.417 --> 00:16:06.083
Which means I should
stop holding back

00:16:06.166 --> 00:16:07.709
and get serious.

00:16:13.333 --> 00:16:14.083
Whoa!

00:16:14.166 --> 00:16:16.333
Flicker, something wrong?

00:16:16.417 --> 00:16:18.917
The aura surrounding
Mira has changed.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.333
Now it's even stronger...
and deeper.

00:16:51.125 --> 00:16:54.500
[WOLF BANE] Why won't you just
accept your defeat?

00:16:56.083 --> 00:16:57.500
I refuse!

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:03.375
[WOLF BANE groans]

00:17:20.417 --> 00:17:22.959
Did--Did she do it?

00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:25.959
No. Not yet!

00:17:26.041 --> 00:17:30.500
I barely even
felt a thing, girl!

00:17:30.583 --> 00:17:32.333
I've trained my body endlessly;

00:17:32.417 --> 00:17:35.709
it can handle a few
attacks of that level!

00:17:35.792 --> 00:17:37.959
So you're as tough as I feared.

00:17:38.041 --> 00:17:41.041
All right, then I won't
waste any more time.

00:17:48.375 --> 00:17:51.250
[WOLF BANE]
Impudence! You are but a human!

00:17:53.709 --> 00:17:55.333
[MIRA laughs]

00:17:55.417 --> 00:17:57.917
Paralysis? But how?

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:03.000
It doesn't look like that
will hold for very long.

00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:06.083
Understandable,
considering your strength.

00:18:06.166 --> 00:18:07.458
Luckily...

00:18:10.625 --> 00:18:12.667
[MIRA]
I told you this at the start.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:15.417
But in case you forgot,
I'm a summoner.

00:18:19.667 --> 00:18:21.166
Impressive.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.542
Is it over this time?

00:18:27.625 --> 00:18:29.166
Mira, that was great!

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.792
[ALL cheer]

00:18:33.834 --> 00:18:36.458
[TACT] That was incredibly
cool, Miss Mira!

00:18:36.542 --> 00:18:39.625
[MIRA]
Yes. It was, wasn't it?

00:18:39.709 --> 00:18:42.458
[EMELLA]
You really saved us. Thank you!

00:18:42.542 --> 00:18:45.583
[ZEF] Yeah, we'd have been toast
if we didn't have you with us!

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:48.041
I've done nothing
to deserve your thanks.

00:18:48.125 --> 00:18:51.333
In fact, I rather dragged you
down here myself, did I not?

00:18:51.417 --> 00:18:53.083
[FLICKER]
So strong, yet so humble!

00:18:53.166 --> 00:18:56.166
I think that's your most
attractive feature, Mira!

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:59.834
[ASVAL] But seriously,
why are you so strong anyway?

00:18:59.917 --> 00:19:01.959
Yeah! I mean,
not only can you summon,

00:19:02.041 --> 00:19:04.333
but you can also use
the Immortal Arts!

00:19:04.417 --> 00:19:06.208
Plus, you just became
an adventurer

00:19:06.291 --> 00:19:08.083
and you're already at Rank C.

00:19:08.166 --> 00:19:12.375
Huh. So you do
wonder about that.

00:19:12.458 --> 00:19:13.792
[MIRA]
Well, at this point

00:19:13.875 --> 00:19:17.625
I owe them some
sort of explanation.

00:19:17.709 --> 00:19:20.291
Have you ever heard of
a person called Danblf?

00:19:20.375 --> 00:19:21.417
[EMELLA]
Of course!

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.291
They call him the
"the One-Man Army,"

00:19:23.375 --> 00:19:24.500
he's a legendary summoner,

00:19:24.583 --> 00:19:26.750
not to mention one
of the Nine Wise Men!

00:19:26.834 --> 00:19:28.208
Doubt there's anyone
in this kingdom

00:19:28.291 --> 00:19:29.625
who doesn't know him.

00:19:29.709 --> 00:19:32.375
I've heard stories
about him! He's so cool!

00:19:32.458 --> 00:19:34.083
I see.

00:19:34.166 --> 00:19:36.500
[clears throat]

00:19:36.583 --> 00:19:39.750
I am a pupil of the
aforementioned Danblf.

00:19:39.834 --> 00:19:42.375
My mentor cannot move about
freely at the moment,

00:19:42.458 --> 00:19:44.750
so I'm acting in his stead.

00:19:44.834 --> 00:19:46.208
That explains it!

00:19:46.291 --> 00:19:48.500
Now I see why you're
as good as you are.

00:19:48.583 --> 00:19:50.041
Aw, man, did you hear that?

00:19:50.125 --> 00:19:53.000
Danblf took a pupil under
his wing. I had no idea!

00:19:53.083 --> 00:19:54.000
What about you, Flicker?

00:19:54.083 --> 00:19:58.000
He took a pupil? Seriously?

00:19:58.083 --> 00:19:59.750
But it's unheard of
for the Nine Wise Men

00:19:59.834 --> 00:20:01.291
to take on students!

00:20:01.375 --> 00:20:03.917
Your looks are incomparable,
you're a tremendously

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.792
accomplished magic user,
and on top of that,

00:20:05.875 --> 00:20:08.041
you've got this
awesome backstory?

00:20:08.125 --> 00:20:09.792
You're making me
like you even more!

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:11.375
What are you trying
to do to me, Mira?

00:20:11.458 --> 00:20:14.250
--This isn't fair!
--[MIRA] Sorry. Anyway.

00:20:14.333 --> 00:20:16.083
This may be odd coming from me,

00:20:16.166 --> 00:20:19.000
but shouldn't you be
at least a tad skeptical?

00:20:19.083 --> 00:20:21.333
I'm aware my story's
a bit out there,

00:20:21.417 --> 00:20:23.875
so I expect some doubt
from those I tell.

00:20:23.959 --> 00:20:27.208
I dunno, you don't seem
like someone who'd lie.

00:20:27.291 --> 00:20:30.000
I mean, you helped us.
You're a good person!

00:20:30.083 --> 00:20:31.375
[gasps]

00:20:31.458 --> 00:20:32.792
[ASVAL]
Now that you mention it,

00:20:32.875 --> 00:20:35.291
the way you fought
reminded me of Danblf.

00:20:35.375 --> 00:20:37.375
I'm no expert, but my old man

00:20:37.458 --> 00:20:39.375
did tell me stories
about the guy.

00:20:39.458 --> 00:20:41.000
It checks out.

00:20:41.083 --> 00:20:42.709
You're both summoners, but you
can both give 'em the business

00:20:42.792 --> 00:20:44.792
yourself when it
comes down to it.

00:20:44.875 --> 00:20:46.375
I suppose.

00:20:46.458 --> 00:20:47.417
[FLICKER]
Listen.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.208
It may've been a long time ago,

00:20:49.291 --> 00:20:51.458
but the Wise Men
saved this kingdom.

00:20:51.542 --> 00:20:54.709
So to us, they're kind of
like heroes of legend.

00:20:54.792 --> 00:20:56.875
So in Tact's eyes,
with you being

00:20:56.959 --> 00:21:01.000
one of the Wise Men's pupil, you
might as well be a hero reborn.

00:21:01.083 --> 00:21:03.041
Kind of a big deal.

00:21:03.125 --> 00:21:04.875
You think so?

00:21:04.959 --> 00:21:06.125
[MIRA]
Yes.

00:21:06.208 --> 00:21:09.166
Further proof these people
aren't just NPCs.

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:11.291
Each one of them has parents,

00:21:11.375 --> 00:21:15.166
memories of their childhood,
and are living in the now.

00:21:17.083 --> 00:21:20.917
[MIRA] It's true.
We must protect this kingdom.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.542
Right, Solomon?

00:21:26.166 --> 00:21:29.417
[EMELLA] "Behold!" Danblf,
the One-Man Army proclaimed

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.959
loud and clear,
as he summoned thousands

00:21:32.041 --> 00:21:34.583
of magic circles
in the skies above!

00:21:34.667 --> 00:21:36.417
Sha-bam!

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:40.250
Ugh. How is it that you're
still telling this story?

00:21:40.333 --> 00:21:41.333
[EMELLA]
What do you mean?

00:21:41.417 --> 00:21:42.875
We're just getting
to the good part!

00:21:42.959 --> 00:21:44.875
There's so much more left to go!

00:21:44.959 --> 00:21:48.125
[MIRA grumbles] Clearly my
biggest mistake of the day

00:21:48.208 --> 00:21:51.291
was off-handedly expressing
interest in this tale.

00:21:51.375 --> 00:21:53.250
You know what would
make us all feel better?

00:21:53.333 --> 00:21:55.291
A celebration when
we get back to town.

00:21:55.375 --> 00:21:58.375
Agreed. Where d'you think
we should go, though?

00:22:00.417 --> 00:22:01.792
--What is it?
--[explosions]

00:22:01.875 --> 00:22:04.083
--Hang on. Is that...?
--[explosions]

00:22:04.166 --> 00:22:08.709
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:22:17.792 --> 00:22:19.208
Not good.
