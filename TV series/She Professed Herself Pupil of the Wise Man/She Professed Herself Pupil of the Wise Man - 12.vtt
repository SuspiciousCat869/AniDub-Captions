[gasps]

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.611 position:50% align:center
[SULEIMAN] Monster hordes
are currently confirmed

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.448 position:50% align:center
at two locations
within the kingdom.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:32.782 position:50% align:center
Both hordes have begun to move

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.243 position:50% align:center
and are attacking
villages along the way.

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:36.911 position:50% align:center
The first is northbound.

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:38.913 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
In the Lugget Highlands?

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:40.498 position:50% align:center
[SULEIMAN] The horde that
appeared halfway between

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:45.795 position:50% align:center
here and Karanak, the City of
Requiem, has begun to move east.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.341 position:50% align:center
Presently, the King's Guard
is holding them at bay, but...

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:51.843 position:50% align:center
The situation is
not looking good.

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:55.764 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] It would seem the
monsters are headed here.

00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:57.140 position:50% align:center
[SULEIMAN]
Yes.

00:00:57.223 --> 00:01:03.063 position:50% align:center
Hordes of 10,000, huh?
No, no, this is an army now.

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:06.149 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
It's just like 30 years ago.

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.318 position:50% align:center
Well, it's a little different.

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:11.863 position:50% align:center
The Nine Wise Men
aren't here this time.

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:14.449 position:50% align:center
Suleiman, send for Luminaria.

00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:16.493 position:50% align:center
She'll handle the
Lugget Highlands.

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:18.745 position:50% align:center
[SULEIMAN] What do we tell
the neighboring kingdoms?

00:01:18.828 --> 00:01:20.789 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
We've no need to be secretive.

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:23.917 position:50% align:center
We're subduing a mass outbreak
of monsters in our kingdom.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.335 position:50% align:center
Let them know that
we won't trouble them.

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:26.378 position:50% align:center
[SULEIMAN]
Sir.

00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:28.004 position:50% align:center
That darned
cease-fire agreement.

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:30.006 position:50% align:center
I wish we weren't
restricted from freely

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.883 position:50% align:center
using our military forces.

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:34.511 position:50% align:center
We can't change that now.
But if the worst happens,

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:36.930 position:50% align:center
it could be an excuse
to scrap the agreement.

00:01:37.013 --> 00:01:38.431 position:50% align:center
I'm well aware.

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:40.725 position:50% align:center
When do you think Mira
will be returning?

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:41.851 position:50% align:center
[SULEIMAN]
She only left for

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.687 position:50% align:center
the Child of Prayer
Forest yesterday.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.647 position:50% align:center
I'd estimate five days.

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:49.275 position:50% align:center
Send Garett to find her.

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:50.860 position:50% align:center
Have him relay
the current situation

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:52.612 position:50% align:center
and the need for her return.

00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:53.863 position:50% align:center
[SULEIMAN]
Understood.

00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:56.658 position:50% align:center
--[SULEIMAN] Ah--
--[SOLOMON] Hm?

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:59.703 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I hate to
bring this up but,

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:02.414 position:50% align:center
Mistress Luminaria has
the day off today.

00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:03.373 position:50% align:center
She what?

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:04.416 position:50% align:center
[SULEIMAN]
In all likelihood,

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:06.459 position:50% align:center
she's shopping
in the castle town.

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:08.211 position:50% align:center
I recall her mentioning
something about

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.547 position:50% align:center
new designer clothes releasing.

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:16.594 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
Well, go find her!

00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:18.680 position:50% align:center
[SULEIMAN]
Sir!

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:20.890 position:50% align:center
[groans] I swear, Mira.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:24.436 position:50% align:center
You better get back here quick!

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.354 position:50% align:center
[MIRA sneezes]

00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:30.650 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Is someone
talking about me?

00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:32.569 position:50% align:center
Ugh.

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:06.371 position:50% align:center
[MONSTERS growling]

00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:09.582 position:50% align:center
[JOACHIM]
Ten thousand really is a lot.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:12.669 position:50% align:center
I guess, but if you look
at the silver lining...

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:19.092 position:50% align:center
You can hit them
without even aiming.

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:22.095 position:50% align:center
That's a good point.
I'm grateful for that.

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:28.560 position:50% align:center
[LUMINARIA] I can't believe
there's a monster attack now.

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:30.854 position:50% align:center
My first day off in four weeks!

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.731 position:50% align:center
And just my luck, it's a horde!

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:34.691 position:50% align:center
Feels like the world's
out to get me.

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:36.234 position:50% align:center
Or it's buggy.

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:37.777 position:50% align:center
[DIVISION SOLDIER 12A] I believe
we'll reach our destination

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:40.947 position:50% align:center
around morning. Feel free
to rest while you can.

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:42.657 position:50% align:center
[LUMINARIA]
Nah, I'll be fine.

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:44.617 position:50% align:center
But thanks for lookin'
out for little ol' me.

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:46.494 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh, of course!

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:50.290 position:50% align:center
[DIVISION SOLDIER 12A] I wish
you luck, Mistress Luminaria.

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:51.499 position:50% align:center
[LUMINARIA]
Thanks.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.253 position:50% align:center
Ready?

00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:58.423 position:50% align:center
You guys ruined my day off,
so I'm gonna ruin you.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:01.426 position:50% align:center
Eat this!

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:06.639 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:07.932 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:15.815 position:50% align:center
[LUMINARIA]
This is startin' to look like

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:18.401 position:50% align:center
a real pain in the ass.

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:21.154 position:50% align:center
[LUMINARIA] Driver, can you
get a message to the King?

00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:22.030 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:23.323 position:50% align:center
Tell him it's gonna take me

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:25.325 position:50% align:center
a little extra time
to take care of this one.

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:26.743 position:50% align:center
Okay?

00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:32.374 position:50% align:center
[LUMINARIA yells]

00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:38.922 position:50% align:center
Oh, well, at least I'll
get some drops outta this.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:40.757 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
She said it'd take extra time,

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.093 position:50% align:center
not that she
couldn't defeat them.

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:46.930 position:50% align:center
Luminaria will be fine.
The problem is,

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:49.724 position:50% align:center
the best we can do
is hold our horde off.

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:50.725 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:53.561 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
Unless... I join them.

00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:57.107 position:50% align:center
[SULEIMAN] Please remain
seated, Your Majesty.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.817 position:50% align:center
But there's no other choice.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.194 position:50% align:center
"But" nothing. You have to stay.

00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:02.654 position:50% align:center
The kingdom would have no leader

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:04.489 position:50% align:center
if something were
to happen to you.

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:06.491 position:50% align:center
What if I just come right back?

00:06:06.574 --> 00:06:09.035 position:50% align:center
I said you cannot
go, understand?

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:12.497 position:50% align:center
You. Can. Not. Go.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.249 position:50% align:center
Fine, you win.

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:21.673 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:32.851 position:50% align:center
[MESSENGER 12A] Commander
Reynard is fighting well.

00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:36.271 position:50% align:center
And the fortress to the
northwest is still holding.

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:37.814 position:50% align:center
And Luminaria?

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:40.275 position:50% align:center
[MESSENGER 12A]
Sir! She says she wants a bath.

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:42.652 position:50% align:center
Good, then she's
got it under control.

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:45.155 position:50% align:center
That isn't terribly
surprising, considering.

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.448 position:50% align:center
[MESSENGER 12B]
Message!

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:51.327 position:50% align:center
[MESSENGER 12B]
A new horde has appeared

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:53.329 position:50% align:center
in the woodlands
to the northeast.

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.665 position:50% align:center
This one's 10,000.

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:57.959 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
Just kill me now!

00:06:58.043 --> 00:07:00.045 position:50% align:center
[SULEIMAN]
Your Majesty, We've already sent

00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:01.796 position:50% align:center
most of our forces
from the capital.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.467 position:50% align:center
I know. We may be
facing a siege here.

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.892 position:50% align:center
[hisses]

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.169 position:50% align:center
A mysterious summoner
has arrived!

00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:44.339 position:50% align:center
A mysterious necromancer
has as well!

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:47.342 position:50% align:center
You shall face me
in my master's stead!

00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:58.478 position:50% align:center
Don't expect to get
past my defenses.

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:05.568 position:50% align:center
Uh. What did you say?

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:06.695 position:50% align:center
[MESSENGER 12C]
Two people claiming to be

00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:08.530 position:50% align:center
a mystery summoner
and necromancer

00:08:08.613 --> 00:08:10.740 position:50% align:center
have begun to
fight the monsters.

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:13.993 position:50% align:center
They're obviously Master Cleos
and Mistress Amalatte.

00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:15.704 position:50% align:center
We should have them
retreat at once.

00:08:15.787 --> 00:08:16.746 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
It's fine.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:17.914 position:50% align:center
[SULEIMAN]
Your Majesty!

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:20.291 position:50% align:center
The Acting Elders
are extremely powerful.

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:22.711 position:50% align:center
Using excessive military
might near the border

00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:24.004 position:50% align:center
will give our
neighboring kingdoms

00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:25.922 position:50% align:center
cause for misunderstandings.

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:28.216 position:50% align:center
Yes, but this is a unique
opportunity to see

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:31.302 position:50% align:center
how they perform in battle.
It's invaluable.

00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:33.263 position:50% align:center
That is true, but still.

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:35.765 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] The alternative
is the kingdom falls.

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:37.475 position:50% align:center
We'll say the two
mystery fighters

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:40.520 position:50% align:center
are well-meaning collaborators,
unaffiliated with us.

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:41.563 position:50% align:center
How's that?

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:42.939 position:50% align:center
They won't believe it.

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:44.941 position:50% align:center
Then come up with
a better excuse.

00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:47.110 position:50% align:center
Very well, I understand.

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:49.571 position:50% align:center
Though I must insist that
we ask the other acting Elders

00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:52.991 position:50% align:center
to refrain from
joining the fight.

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:54.367 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
Now, then.

00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:56.828 position:50% align:center
All our forces
are fully committed.

00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:59.205 position:50% align:center
I'm the only one
left at the ready.

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:06.463 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] This could be our only
opportunity, you know, Danblf?

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.136 position:50% align:center
I have arrived!

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:18.975 position:50% align:center
[REYNARD, JOACHIM gasp]

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:23.021 position:50% align:center
[GOBLINS growl]

00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:28.902 position:50% align:center
What are those?

00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:33.365 position:50% align:center
[JOACHIM]
Reynard, over there!

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:37.577 position:50% align:center
Miss Mira!

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.578 position:50% align:center
[MESSENGER 12A]
Miss Mira has arrived

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:40.455 position:50% align:center
at the fortress
to the northwest.

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:43.583 position:50% align:center
She's begun to mop up
the monsters with ease.

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:44.584 position:50% align:center
Hear that?

00:09:44.668 --> 00:09:45.835 position:50% align:center
Sure did.

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:47.837 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
Hell yes!

00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:50.924 position:50% align:center
I've a message for Mira.
When she's finished there,

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:53.385 position:50% align:center
she should head to
the northeast woodlands.

00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:54.678 position:50% align:center
[MESSENGER 12A]
Sir!

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.308 position:50% align:center
All right, it's our turn
on the offensive.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.230 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:06.856 position:50% align:center

00:20:17.634 --> 00:20:19.844 position:50% align:center
and have tea with
my friends sometimes.

00:20:19.928 --> 00:20:21.805 position:50% align:center
Agreed. It's important.

00:20:21.888 --> 00:20:24.015 position:50% align:center
[CLEOS] Might I mention that,
because of that decision,

00:20:24.099 --> 00:20:26.601 position:50% align:center
I am undertaking all
of Master Danblf's duties?

00:20:26.685 --> 00:20:29.437 position:50% align:center
Hah. Oh, are you now?

00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:31.523 position:50% align:center
Reminds me of something
I heard from Solomon.

00:20:31.606 --> 00:20:33.024 position:50% align:center
That a foolish Acting Elder

00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:35.360 position:50% align:center
took to the battlefield
without permission?

00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:38.071 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. That's quite troubling.

00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:40.448 position:50% align:center
You have to wonder who in the
world that might've been.

00:20:40.532 --> 00:20:43.702 position:50% align:center
You what? That's cheeky.

00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:52.085 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] To think I would come
to be speaking to you two

00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:54.629 position:50% align:center
in such a genuine manner.

00:20:54.713 --> 00:20:58.633 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA]
It makes me happy. For Danblf--

00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:02.470 position:50% align:center
Sorry. For Mira to sit down
and have tea with us like this.

00:21:02.554 --> 00:21:06.016 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Mariana. About that.

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:08.059 position:50% align:center
Apologies.

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:11.271 position:50% align:center
You mean, you're going
on another trip soon?

00:21:14.733 --> 00:21:18.611 position:50% align:center
That's okay. You give
great souvenirs.

00:21:18.695 --> 00:21:20.655 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Mm.

00:21:20.739 --> 00:21:24.534 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] Well, most of the
Nine Wise Men are still MIA.

00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:26.828 position:50% align:center
Chimera Clausen's
capturing spirits.

00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:30.498 position:50% align:center
Mana is warping due to
the absence of said spirits.

00:21:30.582 --> 00:21:33.168 position:50% align:center
And the cease-fire
is expiring soon.

00:21:33.251 --> 00:21:34.836 position:50% align:center
We've got a
mountain of problems.

00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:36.046 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:38.089 position:50% align:center
We're between a rock
and a hard place again.

00:21:38.173 --> 00:21:39.716 position:50% align:center
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:41.843 position:50% align:center
Maybe. Risk is exciting.

00:21:41.926 --> 00:21:44.054 position:50% align:center
This could have been avoided
if the other Wise Men

00:21:44.137 --> 00:21:46.973 position:50% align:center
were more cooperative.
But we know them.

00:21:47.057 --> 00:21:48.266 position:50% align:center
I recall a certain someone

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.894 position:50% align:center
wanting eccentrics
for his kingdom.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.023 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] This is where
I'll build my kingdom.

00:21:55.106 --> 00:21:58.234 position:50% align:center
[DANBLF] Will you aim to unify
the continent, or some such?

00:21:58.318 --> 00:22:00.862 position:50% align:center
No, no. Something
much more interesting.

00:22:00.945 --> 00:22:02.197 position:50% align:center
Meaning what?

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.406 position:50% align:center
In this world,

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:06.451 position:50% align:center
anything is possible
with a little ingenuity.

00:22:06.534 --> 00:22:09.120 position:50% align:center
And so, I want variety.

00:22:09.204 --> 00:22:12.499 position:50% align:center
I want people who can do
all sorts of different things.

00:22:12.582 --> 00:22:14.626 position:50% align:center
That's a nice thought but,
what if you end up

00:22:14.709 --> 00:22:16.961 position:50% align:center
with nothing but
oddballs and misfits?

00:22:17.045 --> 00:22:18.588 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
I'd welcome them!

00:22:18.672 --> 00:22:21.841 position:50% align:center
If we could find people
like you and I... [laughs]

00:22:21.925 --> 00:22:23.259 position:50% align:center
Say maybe ten of us,

00:22:23.343 --> 00:22:26.262 position:50% align:center
I bet we'd be able to
do some amazing things.

00:22:26.346 --> 00:22:27.931 position:50% align:center
Did I really say that?

00:22:28.014 --> 00:22:30.558 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Thanks to you, it never
gets boring around here.

00:22:30.642 --> 00:22:32.060 position:50% align:center
The state of the world
may have changed,

00:22:32.143 --> 00:22:35.230 position:50% align:center
but that's a separate matter.

00:22:35.313 --> 00:22:37.524 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I better take my leave.

00:22:37.607 --> 00:22:40.527 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
Okay. One-Man Army Danblf.

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:43.988 position:50% align:center
Rather, she who professed
herself his Pupil.

00:22:44.072 --> 00:22:48.493 position:50% align:center
I ask you, act as my sword
and find the Wise Men!

00:22:48.576 --> 00:22:51.705 position:50% align:center
Your wish is my
command, King Solomon.

00:22:56.584 --> 00:22:58.628 position:50% align:center
So what's our
order of operations?

00:22:58.712 --> 00:23:01.089 position:50% align:center
First, we track down Soul Howl.

00:23:01.172 --> 00:23:03.633 position:50% align:center
And after that,
it's to the Isuzu League.

00:23:03.717 --> 00:23:06.845 position:50% align:center
I also find Chimera
Clausen's moves disturbing.

00:23:06.928 --> 00:23:09.514 position:50% align:center
Looking into them might
bring me closer to Kagura.

00:23:09.597 --> 00:23:13.977 position:50% align:center
I don't imagine they'll
be easy to find, but I'll try.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.146 position:50% align:center
For now, I supposed
I'll just go about

00:23:16.229 --> 00:23:18.982 position:50% align:center
enjoying how this world
has changed in my absence.

00:23:19.065 --> 00:23:21.151 position:50% align:center
I'll follow you to
the ends of the earth!

00:23:21.234 --> 00:23:23.820 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I'm counting on you,
Party Member One.

00:23:23.903 --> 00:23:25.280 position:50% align:center
[CAT-SITH]
Sir, meow, sir!

00:23:46.259 --> 00:23:49.012 position:50% align:center
Y'know what? I am quite cute!
