00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:24.274 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm all done cleaning!

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:25.567 position:50% align:center
Next.

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:33.533 position:50% align:center
I'm all done preparing
breakfast for you.

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:35.243 position:50% align:center
Master Danblf.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.126 position:50% align:center
You don't want it
to get cold, do you?

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:44.836 position:50% align:center
Master Danblf.

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:22.142 position:50% align:center
So, uh...

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:24.811 position:50% align:center
You're Danblf, right?

00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:26.396 position:50% align:center
Correct.

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.649 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:31.109 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
You don't have to laugh!

00:02:31.192 --> 00:02:33.194 position:50% align:center
How could I not?
It's too funny!

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:36.865 position:50% align:center
Mister regal himself
looks like this now?

00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:40.243 position:50% align:center
You can't expect me to keep
a straight face right now!

00:02:43.455 --> 00:02:45.498 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] When I stumbled upon
your name on my Friends List

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:48.501 position:50% align:center
after all this time,
I practically jumped for joy.

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:51.087 position:50% align:center
And then who shows up
with Danblf's Master Key?

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.881 position:50% align:center
A cutesy little girl!

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:54.507 position:50% align:center
My goodness,
what an embarrassment

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:57.635 position:50% align:center
to have fallen so low!

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:00.930 position:50% align:center
Ugh. I'm a fool to
have let this happen.

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:03.933 position:50% align:center
I simply did it on a whim.

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:06.394 position:50% align:center
I was playing around with
a Vanity Case I bought with

00:03:06.478 --> 00:03:09.773 position:50% align:center
e-credits that were about
to expire, but I fell asleep

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:13.610 position:50% align:center
before I could
revert the changes.

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:15.945 position:50% align:center
So when I woke up,
I looked like this!

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:18.615 position:50% align:center
And I can't undo it without
another Vanity Case!

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:20.033 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're screwed.

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:22.535 position:50% align:center
Gonna be stuck
like that. [laughs]

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:24.662 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] You are enjoying
this far too much!

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:26.164 position:50% align:center
Sorry, sorry.

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:29.501 position:50% align:center
It's just, it's been a while
since I laughed this hard.

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:32.629 position:50% align:center
Prob'ly been about
30 years now.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.175 position:50% align:center
Then it's just as I thought.

00:03:37.258 --> 00:03:42.055 position:50% align:center
The town's changed quite
a bit in that time.

00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:44.849 position:50% align:center
What happened besides
my disappearance?

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:50.647 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I see. So you've
been protecting the kingdom

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.607 position:50% align:center
all by yourself the entire time?

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:54.776 position:50% align:center
[LUMINARIA]
Hey! Are you serious?

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.277 position:50% align:center
Danblf's come back?

00:03:56.361 --> 00:04:00.490 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Luminaria? Explain, Solomon!

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:02.409 position:50% align:center
I never said she wasn't here!

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:05.245 position:50% align:center
Luminaria's the only other
one who reappeared.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.625 position:50% align:center
A-hem. And who might
this beautiful girl be?

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.961 position:50% align:center
That's Danblf.

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:14.838 position:50% align:center
[LUMINARIA gasps]
What the heck?

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:17.549 position:50% align:center
How'd you get so crazy cute?

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:19.009 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Stop that!

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:20.927 position:50% align:center
[LUMINARIA] Oh, when I say
"crazy cute," I mean you're

00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:23.221 position:50% align:center
just so cute, I wanna
pop your little head off!

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:25.390 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Stop it, Loony-naria!

00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:27.726 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:31.021 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Hey, why don't
we grab a bite to eat?

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:32.480 position:50% align:center
There's a lot I
want to talk about.

00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:34.482 position:50% align:center
Um. Okay.

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:42.323 position:50% align:center
That's so good, isn't it?

00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:43.575 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Mm-hm.

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:45.410 position:50% align:center
[LUMINARIA] Pretty sure
it's Solomon's favorite.

00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:48.788 position:50% align:center
Well. Ever since things
changed, that is.

00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:52.542 position:50% align:center
"Since things changed?"
I had a feeling.

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:54.753 position:50% align:center
Yes, since that day
30 years ago,

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:57.297 position:50% align:center
this world's functioned
very differently.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.675 position:50% align:center
You've noticed that you're
able to taste and smell?

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:04.304 position:50% align:center
Even though it was
originally just a VRMMO.

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:07.849 position:50% align:center
So then, what exactly
is this world now?

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:09.434 position:50% align:center
Wish I knew.

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:11.936 position:50% align:center
You don't know after
30 years of this?

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.521 position:50% align:center
What do you expect?

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:16.274 position:50% align:center
I could make a hypothesis, but
I don't have time to prove it.

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:17.609 position:50% align:center
I mean, think about it.

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:19.444 position:50% align:center
I didn't have any
of you Wise Men,

00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:21.321 position:50% align:center
the lynchpin of our defenses.

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:23.615 position:50% align:center
I've been keeping the kingdom
going for three decades

00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:24.783 position:50% align:center
with a major power deficit.

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:26.284 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Apologies for that.

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:28.286 position:50% align:center
I've been working hard
for 20 of those years.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.372 position:50% align:center
Apologies to you as well.

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:32.999 position:50% align:center
Forget the past--let's
talk about the future.

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:35.126 position:50% align:center
I have a request for you,
in particular.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.462 position:50% align:center
A request for only me?

00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:39.756 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
Mm-hm. However...

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.217 position:50% align:center
...you should take some time
to get used to this world.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.761 position:50% align:center
Get used to it, you say?

00:05:52.102 --> 00:05:54.270 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] First off,
and I'm sure you won't enjoy

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:57.482 position:50% align:center
hearing this, we can't use
"Floating Islands" anymore.

00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:58.983 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
You're kidding me!

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:01.361 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that one took
time to accept.

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:04.364 position:50% align:center
Then everything I
stored there is gone?

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:06.324 position:50% align:center
Fortunately, the storeroom
in your Tower

00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:08.618 position:50% align:center
should be safe.
You should check it out.

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:11.371 position:50% align:center
[MIRA whines]

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:13.206 position:50% align:center
One other important thing.

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:16.876 position:50% align:center
In a way, this may be the
biggest challenge for you.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.170 position:50% align:center
How delightful.
There's even more.

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:33.893 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA]
Master Danblf!

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:36.312 position:50% align:center
Welcome back, my Master!

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.942 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA]
Wait. Are you not him?

00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:43.486 position:50% align:center
But that doesn't make
any sense; only Master Danblf

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.322 position:50% align:center
can open the lock here.

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:48.158 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
That was a good tackle.

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:50.618 position:50% align:center
But out of character.

00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:53.538 position:50% align:center
Nothing like the
Mariana I knew before.

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:58.752 position:50% align:center
I'll just come
right out with it.

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:00.962 position:50% align:center
The NPCs are alive.

00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:02.213 position:50% align:center
And what do you
mean by that?

00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:03.965 position:50% align:center
Exactly what it sounds like.

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:05.175 position:50% align:center
They can be happy.

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:06.384 position:50% align:center
They can be sad.

00:07:06.468 --> 00:07:08.470 position:50% align:center
They're no different
from us, now.

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:11.348 position:50% align:center
Well... You'll see what
we mean when you meet one.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:12.849 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
He was right.

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:15.101 position:50% align:center
She certainly didn't act
in this manner before.

00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:15.935 position:50% align:center
--[MARIANA gasps]
--[MIRA yelps]

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:17.312 position:50% align:center
Wait a gosh darn second,

00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:19.356 position:50% align:center
you didn't steal the key
from Master Danblf, did you?

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:22.108 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
I did not!

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:24.736 position:50% align:center
Okay, who are you?

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:26.946 position:50% align:center
Who am I?

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.199 position:50% align:center
You could say I...

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:30.617 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
Oh, by the way.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.037 position:50% align:center
For the time being, let's keep
your identity a secret.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.121 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:37.332 position:50% align:center
One of our best
has become a child.

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:39.876 position:50% align:center
The other kingdoms
won't take us seriously.

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:42.128 position:50% align:center
Right. And it would
confuse our people.

00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:43.338 position:50% align:center
That is true.

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:44.589 position:50% align:center
It certainly wouldn't be ideal

00:07:44.673 --> 00:07:47.384 position:50% align:center
to undermine Danblf's
dignity like that.

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:49.135 position:50% align:center
So, what shall I do then?

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:50.136 position:50% align:center
Good question.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.888 position:50% align:center
What feels right to you?

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.852 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
I am Danblf's pupil.

00:07:57.936 --> 00:07:59.312 position:50% align:center
Mira!

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:07.278 position:50% align:center
Master Danblf has a... pupil?

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:08.697 position:50% align:center
That's right!

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.955 position:50% align:center
So, where is
Master Danblf then?

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:19.416 position:50% align:center
His location?

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:20.667 position:50% align:center
Of course!

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.502 position:50% align:center
He's withdrawn to the
Mystic City of Beasts

00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:23.962 position:50% align:center
to raise a new summoning spirit!

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:26.423 position:50% align:center
As he's done many
a time in the past.

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:28.800 position:50% align:center
Okay then. I guess
that makes sense.

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:31.219 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Danblf cannot
return for some time.

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:34.556 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. He's told
me much about you.

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:36.474 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:39.060 position:50% align:center
You've looked after
the Master's estate.

00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:42.731 position:50% align:center
It appears to be as good as new,
thanks to your efforts.

00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:45.316 position:50% align:center
Thirty years' worth of efforts.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.526 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:50.447 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] So, on behalf
of my master, Danblf,

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.449 position:50% align:center
I thank you for the
care you've shown.

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:55.994 position:50% align:center
It hasn't been
for naught, Mariana.

00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:02.709 position:50% align:center
Master Danblf. Miss Mira.

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:05.337 position:50% align:center
Your words are more
than I deserve.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.589 position:50% align:center
I've been waiting for so long.

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:09.424 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:12.218 position:50% align:center
It's all been worth it.

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:13.678 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.437 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] This feels quite
a bit different from when

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.149 position:50% align:center
I would role-play with
Solomon and the others.

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:28.234 position:50% align:center
It's not just for fun.

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:30.195 position:50% align:center
It hurts.

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:31.780 position:50% align:center
I am sorry,

00:09:31.863 --> 00:09:33.365 position:50% align:center
Mariana.

00:09:36.326 --> 00:09:39.079 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
But... I lied.

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:46.002 position:50% align:center
No matter how hard I try,
I can't avoid dealing with it.

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:47.712 position:50% align:center
I'm well aware of that.

00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:49.881 position:50% align:center
So painfully aware of it.

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:53.968 position:50% align:center
And yet... I simply... can't!

00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:02.060 position:50% align:center
[toilet flushes]

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:08.483 position:50% align:center
Look at me.

00:10:08.566 --> 00:10:11.569 position:50% align:center
And to think, I used
to be so dignified.

00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:17.992 position:50% align:center
To succumb to the basic urge
to urinate is mortifying.

00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:20.495 position:50% align:center
But I cannot fight it.

00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:21.996 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA]
Miss Mira,

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.581 position:50% align:center
--[MIRA screams] I am in here!
--is something the matter?

00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:26.251 position:50% align:center
I heard you talking out loud,
as if someone else were here!

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:27.419 position:50% align:center
Are you all right?

00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:29.087 position:50% align:center
My word, it's nothing--
calm down!

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.463 position:50% align:center
I was simply speaking to myself!

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:34.801 position:50% align:center
Oh, is that so? Well then,
excuse my intrusion.

00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:40.140 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I had no idea
she was such a worrywart.

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:42.851 position:50% align:center
But I suppose one
can never tell.

00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:43.852 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA]
Miss Mira!

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:45.061 position:50% align:center
As I just explained,

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:46.980 position:50% align:center
I simply spoke aloud
without intending to!

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:48.148 position:50% align:center
It's no cause for concern!

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:50.150 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, there is a
messenger on horseback

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:52.068 position:50% align:center
from the royal capital.

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:55.113 position:50% align:center
It seems King Solomon wishes
to see you immediately.

00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:56.781 position:50% align:center
What's this about?

00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:01.202 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] I believe you
have all heard by now,

00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:04.330 position:50% align:center
but this is the pupil
of Danblf, the Wise Man.

00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:05.915 position:50% align:center
I'm Mira.

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:07.959 position:50% align:center
It is a pleasure to meet you.

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:12.589 position:50% align:center
To business.

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:15.675 position:50% align:center
I have summoned her
here for one reason.

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:16.718 position:50% align:center
Suleiman?

00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:17.969 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:11:18.053 --> 00:11:20.138 position:50% align:center
Several days ago,
we observed the appearance

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:22.724 position:50% align:center
of packs of monsters
within our kingdom.

00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:24.809 position:50% align:center
Packs of monsters, you say?

00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:27.228 position:50% align:center
[SULEIMAN]
Yes, in two places.

00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:29.064 position:50% align:center
One in the northwest,

00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:31.816 position:50% align:center
which was about
800 monsters strong.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.568 position:50% align:center
Mistress Luminaria
is headed there.

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:36.154 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I certainly hope
the map doesn't change again.

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:39.491 position:50% align:center
[SULEIMAN] And a second in the
north, near the flower fields.

00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:42.243 position:50% align:center
Only 200 monsters,
but a Lesser Demon

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:44.245 position:50% align:center
has been confirmed
among them, too.

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:46.539 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
That complicates things.

00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:48.416 position:50% align:center
As for that second pack,

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.959 position:50% align:center
I am leaving it to you.

00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:50.835 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Understood.

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:53.338 position:50% align:center
Your Majesty. Please reconsider!

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:56.174 position:50% align:center
We know virtually nothing
of this suspicious young girl.

00:11:56.257 --> 00:11:58.426 position:50% align:center
She can't be
entrusted with this!

00:12:00.512 --> 00:12:02.263 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
You raise a good point.

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:06.184 position:50% align:center
Mira, since you profess
to be Danblf's pupil,

00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:08.895 position:50% align:center
be sure to show us your power.

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:10.438 position:50% align:center
Understood?

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:16.611 position:50% align:center
Certainly, King Solomon, sir.

00:12:25.537 --> 00:12:29.165 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
What is this thing?!

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:30.500 position:50% align:center
Why, you like it?

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.794 position:50% align:center
It's the Kingdom of
Alcait's armored jeep!

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:34.504 position:50% align:center
A secret weapon.

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:36.339 position:50% align:center
This puppy'll take us
straight to the battlefield,

00:12:36.423 --> 00:12:38.425 position:50% align:center
as quickly as possible!

00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:40.135 position:50% align:center
Solomon's resourceful.

00:12:40.218 --> 00:12:43.096 position:50% align:center
I had no idea he'd be able
to build such a thing.

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:45.223 position:50% align:center
[GARRET] Apparently,
thanks to your Magic Stones,

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:47.392 position:50% align:center
it's fully functional now!

00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:50.395 position:50% align:center
On behalf of the Mobile
Armored Division, I, Garret,

00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:51.730 position:50% align:center
thank you for your service.

00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:54.190 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Magic Stones?

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:55.817 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
Oh, by the way.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.028 position:50% align:center
If you have Magic Stones,
could I have them?

00:12:58.111 --> 00:12:59.112 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:12:59.195 --> 00:13:02.449 position:50% align:center
I can make you
as many as you'll need.

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:03.992 position:50% align:center
Ah yes, those.

00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:05.994 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] It seems there's been
some interesting developments

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:08.288 position:50% align:center
these last 30 years.

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:13.501 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] But this thing is beyond
unkind to its passengers!

00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:15.420 position:50% align:center
[GARRET] Well, there's always
room for improvement!

00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:17.672 position:50% align:center
Feel free to keep
the feedback coming.

00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:20.216 position:50% align:center
Well, for starters,
it's making me nauseous!

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.761 position:50% align:center
Sure you're a pupil of
one of the Nine Wise Men?

00:13:22.844 --> 00:13:26.056 position:50% align:center
You can't even handle
a bumpy ride.

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:27.599 position:50% align:center
Reynard!

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.269 position:50% align:center
I apologize for him, Miss Mira.

00:13:31.353 --> 00:13:32.520 position:50% align:center
No need.

00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:34.647 position:50% align:center
Every group has its share
of trash talking,

00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:35.732 position:50% align:center
I'm quite familiar.

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:37.108 position:50% align:center
[beeping]

00:13:37.192 --> 00:13:38.693 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR 2A]
As we expected.

00:13:38.777 --> 00:13:42.030 position:50% align:center
The pack of monsters is headed
to their previous destination.

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:45.075 position:50% align:center
Oh-ho. We can
communicate as well?

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:47.660 position:50% align:center
And what was that
about a "point?"

00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:49.371 position:50% align:center
Well, a few days ago,

00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:52.749 position:50% align:center
a pack of monsters
appeared in the same place.

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.584 position:50% align:center
And immediately,

00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:58.088 position:50% align:center
they all started to fight
each other on the spot.

00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:02.175 position:50% align:center
It was like their very
purpose was to die there.

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:04.344 position:50% align:center
Interesting idea.

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:06.930 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I never did enjoy
Lesser Demon quests.

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:09.182 position:50% align:center
They always left a
bad taste in my mouth.

00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:11.851 position:50% align:center
There may be more to this
than meets the eye.

00:14:11.935 --> 00:14:16.272 position:50% align:center
[yelps, screams]

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:19.234 position:50% align:center
We've reached our destination!

00:14:19.317 --> 00:14:21.319 position:50% align:center
Garret, I swear!

00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:23.947 position:50% align:center
Welp. I wish you all
luck in battle.

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:28.868 position:50% align:center
Miss Mira.

00:14:28.952 --> 00:14:30.203 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:32.455 position:50% align:center
King Solomon ordered us
to leave the Lesser Demon

00:14:32.539 --> 00:14:36.167 position:50% align:center
to you. He doesn't want us
interfering if we can help it.

00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:38.586 position:50% align:center
Be sure. Can you
really handle it?

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.839 position:50% align:center
You don't believe
I can defeat it by myself?

00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:42.465 position:50% align:center
I have no reason to.

00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:43.508 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:45.635 position:50% align:center
I suppose that is true.

00:14:50.932 --> 00:14:52.851 position:50% align:center
Pretty, aren't they?

00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:54.769 position:50% align:center
Smell good, too.

00:14:54.853 --> 00:14:59.357 position:50% align:center
Such beauty is what Solomon
is trying to protect, huh?

00:14:59.441 --> 00:15:02.110 position:50% align:center
And it's what you
fight for, as well.

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:02.986 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:05.822 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:08.158 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Then it will all be okay.

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:11.244 position:50% align:center
We're aligned. I feel the same.

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:15.415 position:50% align:center
I won't let you ruin this!

00:15:17.334 --> 00:15:20.587 position:50% align:center
I, the Commander of the
King's Guard, Reynard,

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:23.006 position:50% align:center
am here!

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:25.508 position:50% align:center
O Wind, become my blade!

00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:32.390 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:15:35.352 --> 00:15:36.686 position:50% align:center
Oh-ho.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.480 position:50% align:center
They use a spell
to quite literally

00:15:38.563 --> 00:15:40.940 position:50% align:center
disarm their opponents,
then finish them off

00:15:41.024 --> 00:15:42.692 position:50% align:center
with a simple sword.

00:15:42.776 --> 00:15:44.027 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:47.113 position:50% align:center
Solomon has good reason
to keep them by his side!

00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:51.785 position:50% align:center
I know, I know.

00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:53.411 position:50% align:center
It's my turn!

00:15:57.082 --> 00:15:59.125 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
So, it does have one.

00:15:59.209 --> 00:16:02.879 position:50% align:center
That's a Demon Crystal that can
summon a random legendary beast!

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:05.840 position:50% align:center
[growls, roars]

00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:13.556 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.059 position:50% align:center
Now to see what in the
world we're up against.

00:16:21.398 --> 00:16:22.607 position:50% align:center
[REYNARD]
A cockatrice?

00:16:22.691 --> 00:16:24.609 position:50% align:center
That's bad news for us!

00:16:24.693 --> 00:16:27.195 position:50% align:center
Its eyes can turn us into stone!

00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:38.748 position:50% align:center
Is that a Dark Knight?

00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:41.251 position:50% align:center
[JOAQUIM]
What? When did she summon it?

00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:43.003 position:50% align:center
It's over.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.473 position:50% align:center
[REYNARD]
What power!

00:16:55.557 --> 00:16:57.475 position:50% align:center
[GOBLIN 2A groans]

00:16:57.559 --> 00:16:59.185 position:50% align:center
I must say,
she's proving worthy

00:16:59.269 --> 00:17:01.730 position:50% align:center
of King Solomon's faith.

00:17:01.813 --> 00:17:03.023 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:08.236 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
There it is.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.739 position:50% align:center
The Lesser Demon's Grudge Mist.

00:17:18.163 --> 00:17:19.956 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.000 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] So, the Grudge Mist
has settled itself

00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:24.377 position:50% align:center
within the legendary
beast, has it?

00:17:24.461 --> 00:17:25.670 position:50% align:center
That's not something
that could happen

00:17:25.754 --> 00:17:27.964 position:50% align:center
back when this was just a game.

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:34.971 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:45.357 position:50% align:center
The beast seems to have
grown a great deal stronger.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.691 position:50% align:center
Fine, then.

00:17:52.489 --> 00:17:54.240 position:50% align:center
Well, well.

00:17:54.324 --> 00:17:55.408 position:50% align:center
Funny.

00:17:55.492 --> 00:17:57.786 position:50% align:center
In the game, this item
was just for show.

00:17:57.869 --> 00:18:00.413 position:50% align:center
It wasn't even
tangible to players.

00:18:00.497 --> 00:18:03.124 position:50% align:center
Fascinating that
this changed, too.

00:18:03.208 --> 00:18:05.418 position:50% align:center
I wonder what I can do with it.

00:18:05.502 --> 00:18:07.295 position:50% align:center
What better time
to experiment than now,

00:18:07.379 --> 00:18:09.714 position:50% align:center
with a battlefield
full of enemies?

00:18:09.798 --> 00:18:12.634 position:50% align:center
Elemental Shift, my Dark Knight!

00:18:22.227 --> 00:18:24.646 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:27.148 position:50% align:center
You're sporting quite
the grotesque look now.

00:18:27.232 --> 00:18:30.235 position:50% align:center
Should I start calling you
a Dark Beast instead?

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.954 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:45.458 position:50% align:center
Ah. I see you've taken
care of your enemies.

00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:46.418 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:48.253 position:50% align:center
[REYNARD]
But, what is this?

00:18:51.715 --> 00:18:53.758 position:50% align:center
Such a large-scale battle.

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:16.239 position:50% align:center
I intended for this
to be a test run,

00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:17.866 position:50% align:center
but it's gotten
a bit out of hand.

00:19:17.949 --> 00:19:19.200 position:50% align:center
Test run?

00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:21.327 position:50% align:center
Considering how it doesn't
take direct commands,

00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:23.496 position:50% align:center
I'll have to think about
when it's best for battle.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.498 position:50% align:center
Wait, what does that mean?

00:19:25.582 --> 00:19:27.292 position:50% align:center
It looks like it
understands the commands

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:29.753 position:50% align:center
"go" and "stop,"
but that's about it.

00:19:29.836 --> 00:19:33.506 position:50% align:center
[JOAQUIM, REYNARD]
Hold on, what?

00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:36.426 position:50% align:center
I think we've seen enough.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.602 position:50% align:center
Send it back.

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:54.069 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness.

00:19:54.152 --> 00:19:55.445 position:50% align:center
[REYNARD]
Hey!

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.408 position:50% align:center
Now, the finale.

00:20:08.625 --> 00:20:10.043 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:20:10.126 --> 00:20:11.836 position:50% align:center
It's definitely better when
they actually listen to you,

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.546 position:50% align:center
that's for sure.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:18.134 position:50% align:center
The sheer number of summons,
and to control them all at once.

00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:21.805 position:50% align:center
There's only one
who could do that.

00:20:21.888 --> 00:20:25.058 position:50% align:center
[REYNARD]
Danblf, the One-Man Army.

00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:31.815 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
So how was Mira?

00:20:31.898 --> 00:20:34.609 position:50% align:center
[JOAQUIM] I can't muster
a word of criticism.

00:20:34.693 --> 00:20:36.986 position:50% align:center
I can only say
she was magnificent.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.363 position:50% align:center
[REYNARD]
I now have no doubt

00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:40.573 position:50% align:center
that she is Master
Danblf's pupil.

00:20:40.657 --> 00:20:46.579 position:50% align:center
I see. I'm glad you understand.
So, what's the monsters' goal?

00:20:46.663 --> 00:20:49.749 position:50% align:center
We have a suspicion,
but no proof.

00:20:49.833 --> 00:20:51.918 position:50% align:center
I believe their
objective is to create

00:20:52.002 --> 00:20:53.503 position:50% align:center
the "Undead Swamp."

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:57.257 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] The thing that's
supposed to spawn undead?

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.384 position:50% align:center
Plentiful corpses.

00:20:59.467 --> 00:21:02.095 position:50% align:center
An unthinkable
number of lives lost.

00:21:02.178 --> 00:21:06.850 position:50% align:center
Finally, a location that
contains some level of power.

00:21:06.933 --> 00:21:08.768 position:50% align:center
All the requirements are met.

00:21:08.852 --> 00:21:12.105 position:50% align:center
And a Lesser Demon
that controls monsters.

00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:14.566 position:50% align:center
It's true, it's suspicious.

00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:17.277 position:50% align:center
Thank you. You're dismissed.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.862 position:50% align:center
[JOAQUIM, REYNARD]
Yes, sire.

00:21:20.864 --> 00:21:24.909 position:50% align:center
These demons making moves,
the Wise Man vacancy,

00:21:24.993 --> 00:21:27.829 position:50% align:center
and one year left
on our agreement.

00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:30.040 position:50% align:center
We've got plenty of problems.

00:21:30.123 --> 00:21:33.293 position:50% align:center
And yet, Your Majesty,
you seem to be having fun.

00:21:33.376 --> 00:21:34.711 position:50% align:center
Oh, do I now?

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:38.673 position:50% align:center
--Yes.
--[SOLOMON chuckles]

00:21:38.757 --> 00:21:40.759 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] What's funny,
is that this is moment

00:21:40.842 --> 00:21:43.053 position:50% align:center
when you'd return to us.

00:21:43.136 --> 00:21:45.096 position:50% align:center
It's a pretty exciting
time to have you back,

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:47.182 position:50% align:center
fighting on our side!

00:21:47.265 --> 00:21:48.808 position:50% align:center
Ey, Danblf?

00:21:54.314 --> 00:21:56.483 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm all done cleaning!

00:21:56.566 --> 00:21:57.734 position:50% align:center
Next.

00:22:02.238 --> 00:22:03.198 position:50% align:center
I'm all done preparing

00:22:03.281 --> 00:22:06.368 position:50% align:center
your breakfast
for you, Miss Mira.

00:22:06.451 --> 00:22:08.953 position:50% align:center
Ooh! It looks delicious!

00:22:09.037 --> 00:22:10.121 position:50% align:center
Please have your fill!

00:22:10.205 --> 00:22:11.122 position:50% align:center
I can make more.

00:22:11.206 --> 00:22:12.165 position:50% align:center
My thanks!

00:22:12.248 --> 00:22:13.917 position:50% align:center
I'm famished!

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:18.713 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
This is great, Mariana!
