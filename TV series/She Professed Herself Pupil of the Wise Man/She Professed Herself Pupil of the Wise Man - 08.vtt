00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:19.769 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA]
I wonder...

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:25.442 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA] How are you doing
right now, Master Danblf?

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:29.612 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
This is kinda nerve-wracking.

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.990 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Cleos, some light, if you would?

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:33.658 position:50% align:center
It'd be my pleasure.

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:43.418 position:50% align:center
[HINATA gasps]
So bright!

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.134 position:50% align:center
The desks and stuff
are falling apart,

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:53.720 position:50% align:center
but the books and other
materials look new.

00:00:53.803 --> 00:00:56.806 position:50% align:center
Must be the preservation
and antitheft magic.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.142 position:50% align:center
This place is
functionally a dungeon.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.811 position:50% align:center
But it was originally
an archive.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:02.937 position:50% align:center
Speaking of dungeons,

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:05.523 position:50% align:center
I spot a cluster
of monsters ahead.

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:16.368 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] But they're
not much of a threat.

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.579 position:50% align:center
What do you say we
give them a quick drubbing

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:21.664 position:50% align:center
and be on our merry way?

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:22.832 position:50% align:center
Hold on!

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.251 position:50% align:center
Would it be okay if
I took care of them?

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:27.170 position:50% align:center
I'd love to use this
rare opportunity

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:29.714 position:50% align:center
to get your feedback
on my summoning.

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:33.927 position:50% align:center
[HINATA] I'll probably never
get a chance like this again.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.512 position:50% align:center
I've no issue with that.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.305 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much!

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:41.101 position:50% align:center
Okay! Take a look
at my top summon!

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:48.316 position:50% align:center
Ooh, fun. A salamander, huh?

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.276 position:50% align:center
It looks ready for anything.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.486 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
I know, right?

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:53.655 position:50% align:center
I can't get over how
stout and heavy it is!

00:01:53.738 --> 00:01:56.074 position:50% align:center
Look at those eyes,
they're so big and cute!

00:01:56.157 --> 00:01:56.991 position:50% align:center
And those scales!

00:01:57.075 --> 00:01:59.536 position:50% align:center
Shaped like such a friend!

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.789 position:50% align:center
Anyway, here we gyo--
here we go!

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:11.881 position:50% align:center
Ooh.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:14.342 position:50% align:center
[HINATA laughs]
That was so perfect!

00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:15.844 position:50% align:center
You were amazing!

00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:19.097 position:50% align:center
Ah-- So, uh, how'd my
little guy do?

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.433 position:50% align:center
I thought the Fire Breath
was rather impressive.

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:23.977 position:50% align:center
It'll be effective against
higher level enemies, too.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.645 position:50% align:center
[HINATA giggles]

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:29.065 position:50% align:center
However, their movements
were just a tad bit sluggish.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:32.235 position:50% align:center
It may be a good idea to
focus on training mobility.

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:33.653 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:02:33.737 --> 00:02:36.656 position:50% align:center
Salamanders lack defense,
so higher speed will help.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.201 position:50% align:center
Higher speed. Got it.
That's great to know. Ready?

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:42.162 position:50% align:center
After this, we're training!

00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:46.875 position:50% align:center
They are practically
like mother and child.

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:50.420 position:50% align:center
Yes. I'm sure you're well aware
of how common that is.

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:53.340 position:50% align:center
Summons can be like family,
don't you think?

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.726 position:50% align:center
There are many monsters
here, as well.

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:06.394 position:50% align:center
Ah, I have an idea.

00:03:06.478 --> 00:03:07.479 position:50% align:center
Would you be willing to show us

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:09.856 position:50% align:center
your salamander
this time, Cleos?

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.359 position:50% align:center
Let it serve as an
example for Ms. Hinata.

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:14.027 position:50% align:center
Example, you say?

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.780 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! I'd love
to see it in battle!

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:20.075 position:50% align:center
If it'll help. Watch closely.

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:22.660 position:50% align:center
Appear! Salamander!

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:30.043 position:50% align:center
Whoa, mine looks
completely different!

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:31.961 position:50% align:center
All right, here we go.

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:43.640 position:50% align:center
Wow. So fast.

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:47.185 position:50% align:center
Cleos's salamander is geared
towards mobility, after all.

00:03:47.268 --> 00:03:49.229 position:50% align:center
Depending on how you
choose to raise yours,

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:50.772 position:50% align:center
anything is possible.

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:51.815 position:50% align:center
You're right!

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:52.899 position:50% align:center
I'll just have to make sure

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:55.443 position:50% align:center
I develop my little
one's strengths!

00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:57.654 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Rather than be
discouraged by his ability,

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:00.115 position:50% align:center
she harbors hope
for what can be.

00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:01.533 position:50% align:center
That's promising.

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:04.035 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to see
how she grows.

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:06.079 position:50% align:center
Thanks. That'll be all.

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:10.542 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Not bad. You've improved a bit.

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.502 position:50% align:center
[CLEOS]
Thank you very much.

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:14.713 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
That's what she calls "not bad"?

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:22.679 position:50% align:center
Well, it says to place
the firefly glowstone here.

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:25.390 position:50% align:center
Simple enough instructions.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.690 position:50% align:center
Ooh! We've opened up
a bright new path!

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:36.192 position:50% align:center
[HINATA, MIRA gasp]

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:39.279 position:50% align:center
I think it's actually this way.

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:40.655 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
I fell for it!

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:42.115 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
That makes no sense!

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:44.117 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't shoot the messenger.

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:58.256 position:50% align:center
They look ready to come
to life at any moment.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.091 position:50% align:center
It's as you surmise.

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:02.552 position:50% align:center
First, the knight with
the sword will attack.

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:04.346 position:50% align:center
And then, the one
with the halberd

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:06.681 position:50% align:center
will jump out when
we're not looking.

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:08.683 position:50% align:center
Yes. Amusing, no?

00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:11.686 position:50% align:center
First-time foes always
get my heart racing.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.273 position:50% align:center
But I don't often meet any.
So let me handle this.

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:16.691 position:50% align:center
[CLEOS]
As you wish.

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:18.777 position:50% align:center
She sounds like
she's having fun.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.195 position:50% align:center
Ms. Hinata.

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:23.073 position:50% align:center
I suggest you pay close
attention as Miss Mira fights.

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:24.324 position:50% align:center
It'll be a glimpse into

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:26.826 position:50% align:center
the pinnacle of evocation
magic's potential.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.579 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
Right! I won't blink!

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:30.789 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Now, then.

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:34.084 position:50% align:center
My opponents appear
to be golems, so...

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:35.919 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:41.174 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:45.095 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
Wait, is that even a salamander?

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:47.472 position:50% align:center
Ah! This brings back memories!

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:51.393 position:50% align:center
Am I crazy, or is that just
a dragon without wings?

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:55.689 position:50% align:center
[CLEOS] Miss Mira's salamander
is able to expand the air

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:57.816 position:50% align:center
with the heat from
its fire, fly,

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:59.567 position:50% align:center
even without the use of wings,

00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:02.195 position:50% align:center
and manipulate flames as well.

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:09.244 position:50% align:center
Wow, incredible!

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:10.870 position:50% align:center
She finished off
the first statue

00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:13.248 position:50% align:center
before the second
had a chance to move.

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:17.627 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Mm, an impressive display.

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:19.421 position:50% align:center
[CLEOS]
I'd expect no less of you.

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:21.339 position:50% align:center
Very educational.

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:26.261 position:50% align:center
[HINATA] So that's what
real summoning is like.

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:29.806 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Come. We're not far
from the final area now.

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.516 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
Oh! Yeah.

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:46.531 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
There is a lot to look through.

00:06:46.614 --> 00:06:48.491 position:50% align:center
This will be no easy task.

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:49.743 position:50% align:center
[CLEOS]
That reminds me,

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:51.953 position:50% align:center
you're here in search
of information, correct?

00:06:52.037 --> 00:06:53.413 position:50% align:center
Of what sort?

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:55.248 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
This.

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:56.541 position:50% align:center
Relating to the plant life

00:06:56.624 --> 00:06:58.585 position:50% align:center
in the southern part
of the continent.

00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:01.671 position:50% align:center
In that case...
That'll be in Section 6.

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:02.964 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Excuse me?

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:05.467 position:50% align:center
Why is there a
directory in a dungeon?

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.677 position:50% align:center
Well, this area
used to be a museum,

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:09.846 position:50% align:center
and you wouldn't want
people getting lost.

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:11.181 position:50% align:center
That's a good point,

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:13.391 position:50% align:center
so it's left over
from back then, huh?

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:17.103 position:50% align:center
And just our luck,
it's far in the back.

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:19.773 position:50% align:center
But if I fly, it won't
take more than a minute!

00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:22.025 position:50% align:center
[CLEOS]
You mustn't!

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:24.611 position:50% align:center
If you stray from the fixed
route or take books too far

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:26.988 position:50% align:center
from their shelves, it'll
trigger the anti-theft alarm!

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:29.032 position:50% align:center
It'll spawn countless golems
and defensive walls,

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:30.658 position:50% align:center
and we'll be in big trouble!

00:07:30.742 --> 00:07:32.035 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
A-Ah, yes.

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.287 position:50% align:center
Understood, we will walk.

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:55.225 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Yet another gimmick
to solve before progressing.

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:56.351 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
What is it?

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:57.852 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
You know.

00:07:57.936 --> 00:08:00.063 position:50% align:center
One of those puzzle cubes
where you line up the colors?

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:01.648 position:50% align:center
[CLEOS]
Yes, you're right.

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:04.067 position:50% align:center
It's not that I can't
solve them, but uh,

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.027 position:50% align:center
don't they take a long time?

00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:10.156 position:50% align:center
Yes. I could solve it, too,
if given about six hours.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.783 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
And it's five by five.

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:13.952 position:50% align:center
Even three by three
is difficult for me.

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:17.330 position:50% align:center
[CLEOS] I may be the acting
elder, but this is no joke!

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:20.333 position:50% align:center
[HINATA] Um. I
finished it, we can go!

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:21.793 position:50% align:center
[MIRA, CLEOS]
Huh?!

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:23.545 position:50% align:center
Puzzles are a forte of mine.

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:25.755 position:50% align:center
You're amazing,
that was insanely fast!

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:28.508 position:50% align:center
What a talent
you've got there!

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:31.594 position:50% align:center
[HINATA] The truth is,
I've had so much free time

00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:35.015 position:50% align:center
during class, I spent
all of it doing puzzles.

00:08:35.098 --> 00:08:37.642 position:50% align:center
[CLEOS, MIRA] Well that put
a damper on the mood.

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:41.021 position:50% align:center
[CLEOS]
When I explored last time,

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:43.857 position:50% align:center
this was as far as I got, but...

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.942 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
The ancient spirit language.

00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:48.737 position:50% align:center
I can see why you got stuck.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.947 position:50% align:center
[CLEOS] Even Master Suleiman
couldn't decipher it,

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:53.825 position:50% align:center
and he's an expert at
all spirit languages.

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:56.745 position:50% align:center
I know!

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:01.541 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] The stareater, gazing up
at the sky carries a bow

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:03.585 position:50% align:center
glowing like the setting sun.

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:04.836 position:50% align:center
Notching bolts of lightning,

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:06.963 position:50% align:center
they unleash their
power into the void.

00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:09.716 position:50% align:center
Striking constellations,
they rain the forgotten souls

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.718 position:50% align:center
of fallen heroes down
from the heavens,

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:15.638 position:50% align:center
and into dreams as they
depart the cycle of rebirth.

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:18.183 position:50% align:center
For that is the cold
azure vision that remains

00:09:18.266 --> 00:09:21.519 position:50% align:center
of the sky in the memories of
the ghosts who sleep in Akasha's

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:24.939 position:50% align:center
cage in the distant
crevices of this world.

00:09:25.023 --> 00:09:26.441 position:50% align:center
In this star-filled realm,

00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:29.235 position:50% align:center
let thy history fall
into these hands!

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:32.864 position:50% align:center
Master!

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:35.867 position:50% align:center
Pam! Hello!
It's been a long time!

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.620 position:50% align:center
I request an embrace
and to be lifted up!

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:40.872 position:50% align:center
There, there!
Good girl, good girl!

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:42.624 position:50% align:center
[PAM coos]

00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:45.794 position:50% align:center
So, she used that huge amount
of mana on this summon,

00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:47.379 position:50% align:center
and it's this little girl?

00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:49.547 position:50% align:center
It's Lady Pam, a rainbow spirit.

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:52.926 position:50% align:center
She's from the distant past but
is reborn over and over again,

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:55.136 position:50% align:center
and she retains her knowledge.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.763 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:58.181 position:50% align:center
How about it, Pam?

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:01.017 position:50% align:center
Do you think you can read
what it says there for me?

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:02.435 position:50% align:center
Let me see.

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:05.647 position:50% align:center
It looks like it describes
how to disarm this thing.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.982 position:50% align:center
If you look around,
there are ten stone statues

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:10.652 position:50% align:center
within the vicinity, and it
says to turn some of them

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:12.529 position:50% align:center
left or right, in order.

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:14.572 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I knew I could
count on you, Pam.

00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:16.032 position:50% align:center
Think you can read off
the instructions

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:17.534 position:50% align:center
so we can follow them?

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:19.285 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course!

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:21.246 position:50% align:center
First, the black
four-legged beast.

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:23.123 position:50% align:center
Turn it to the right!

00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:24.791 position:50% align:center
[CLEOS]
Roger that.

00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:28.253 position:50% align:center
[PAM] And next, do the same
to the white four-legged beast.

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:29.921 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
Got it.

00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:32.424 position:50% align:center
Finally, turn the
black orb to the left.

00:10:32.507 --> 00:10:35.093 position:50% align:center
Very well. Come on, you.

00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:41.808 position:50% align:center
[CLEOS, HINATA, MIRA]
We did it!

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:43.435 position:50% align:center
You were a great help!

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:46.104 position:50% align:center
Your work here is done.

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:50.191 position:50% align:center
No! Not yet. I wanna stay!

00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:52.694 position:50% align:center
You're such a baby, Pam.
You can stay.

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:54.446 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:56.406 position:50% align:center
I am glad for you, Lady Pam.

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:58.908 position:50% align:center
I understand how you feel,
I've been there.

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:00.785 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
Uh... Wait, what?

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:03.455 position:50% align:center
Does Master Cleos
like to be babied, too?

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:06.583 position:50% align:center
I, uh, think it's great
you found yourself.

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.043 position:50% align:center
[CLEOS]
Hm?

00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:12.339 position:50% align:center
Now then, we'll need
to take a good portion

00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:13.840 position:50% align:center
of the information here.

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:16.634 position:50% align:center
Uh, but won't the
traps be set off?

00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:20.555 position:50% align:center
Not if we use these.

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:24.517 position:50% align:center
We can copy any page by simply
pressing this paper against it.

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:26.728 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
Ooh, that's fancy!

00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:30.148 position:50% align:center
Okay, let's split up
and get to copying.

00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:32.942 position:50% align:center
[PAM]
Master! Play with me!

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:34.694 position:50% align:center
Please! Play with me!

00:11:34.778 --> 00:11:35.945 position:50% align:center
Aww.

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:37.989 position:50% align:center
Be a good girl and wait
until after we're done.

00:11:38.073 --> 00:11:41.117 position:50% align:center
Aw. Can I go play
by myself, then?

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:44.245 position:50% align:center
Sure. Just don't wander off
too far, all right?

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:45.747 position:50% align:center
I consent.

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:58.927 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Well that took about
as long as I thought it would.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:03.556 position:50% align:center
[PAM] Master! I humbly request
a recitation of this text!

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.684 position:50% align:center
Oh. You wish me to read?

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:06.851 position:50% align:center
[MIRA gasps]

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:08.019 position:50% align:center
Oh, Pam!

00:12:08.103 --> 00:12:10.105 position:50% align:center
Where's the shelf
you took that off of?

00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:11.272 position:50% align:center
Over there!

00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:13.233 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] You are such
a troublesome child!

00:12:20.824 --> 00:12:22.534 position:50% align:center
Ooh! It's like I'm flying!

00:12:22.617 --> 00:12:26.204 position:50% align:center
--This is so cool!
--[MIRA] Yes! Up, up, and away!

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:29.124 position:50% align:center
[CLEOS]
Miss Mira! Quickly, your hand!

00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:34.421 position:50% align:center
[PAM]
The text!

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:37.173 position:50% align:center
There we are.

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:38.758 position:50% align:center
We triggered the
anti-theft spell,

00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:41.511 position:50% align:center
so the book is returning
to its original shelf.

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center
Luckily, we'd already finished
copying what we needed.

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:46.016 position:50% align:center
How fortunate.

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:48.768 position:50% align:center
Well, that means our
mission is complete!

00:12:48.852 --> 00:12:51.604 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
Yeah! And I learned so much.

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:54.149 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna kick my
summoning game up a notch!

00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:56.568 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Mm, that's the spirit!

00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:59.904 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] She solved the
puzzle cube that quickly? Huh.

00:12:59.988 --> 00:13:02.449 position:50% align:center
She's got some unexpected
talents, I'll give her that.

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:04.284 position:50% align:center
I don't know what we'd
have done without her,

00:13:04.367 --> 00:13:07.328 position:50% align:center
except waste an additional
six hours or so.

00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:08.329 position:50% align:center
I bet.

00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:10.457 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I'll take those copies.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.334 position:50% align:center
Do with them as you see fit.

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:13.626 position:50% align:center
Speaking of your trek.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.004 position:50% align:center
I heard you revealed
your identity to Cleos.

00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:17.672 position:50% align:center
Yes. I did.

00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:19.883 position:50% align:center
Guess I wasn't careful enough.

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:22.010 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] Welp, we can't
help that he's smart.

00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:24.721 position:50% align:center
But now that he knows, don't you
think there's someone else

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.806 position:50% align:center
deserving of that
information, too?

00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:30.643 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
I mean, come on.

00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:33.646 position:50% align:center
Her life's purpose was and
is to be your assistant.

00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:38.318 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON] The next trip
I'm gonna have you go on

00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:41.363 position:50% align:center
is gonna be a long one,
so if that bothers you,

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:43.740 position:50% align:center
now's your chance to fix it.

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:46.201 position:50% align:center
I swear, that man's
always so pushy.

00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:50.080 position:50% align:center
I don't need be reminded who
deserves to know my secret.

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:51.790 position:50% align:center
This far away from the city,

00:13:51.873 --> 00:13:54.250 position:50% align:center
it should be safe
to summon that one.

00:14:07.222 --> 00:14:10.183 position:50% align:center
It's been a while.
Ey, Eisenfald?

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:11.309 position:50% align:center
[EISENFALD]
Father.

00:14:11.393 --> 00:14:14.270 position:50% align:center
When did you become Mother?

00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:19.984 position:50% align:center
Apologies, it's a long story.
I'd rather not get into it.

00:14:20.068 --> 00:14:24.280 position:50% align:center
[EISENFALD] Fath-- Mother,
if you insist, I will not press.

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:27.117 position:50% align:center
In truth, I am joyous
to suddenly gain a mother.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.493 position:50% align:center
Oh. That's good.

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:30.495 position:50% align:center
Well, why don't we
catch up a little bit?

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:32.414 position:50% align:center
How have you been lately?

00:14:32.497 --> 00:14:35.750 position:50% align:center
[EISENFALD] Fine. But I was
heartbroken from not seeing you.

00:14:35.834 --> 00:14:37.627 position:50% align:center
I feared that you
had forgotten me.

00:14:37.711 --> 00:14:40.171 position:50% align:center
Sorry. That must've
been difficult.

00:14:40.255 --> 00:14:43.341 position:50% align:center
I take it you were alone
for that entire time as well?

00:14:43.425 --> 00:14:45.343 position:50% align:center
[EISENFALD]
No. I live with my kind

00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:47.053 position:50% align:center
in the City of Dragons.

00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:49.389 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I didn't realize
such a thing exists now.

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:51.474 position:50% align:center
[EISENFALD]
Yes. Oh, right.

00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:53.560 position:50% align:center
Perhaps this would
be more agreeable?

00:14:53.643 --> 00:14:55.520 position:50% align:center
I learned to do this
from a human woman,

00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:57.063 position:50% align:center
not unlike yourself.

00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:00.025 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Wh-What is this?

00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:03.069 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Are you
still Eisenfald?

00:15:03.153 --> 00:15:04.821 position:50% align:center
Yes, naturally.

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:07.073 position:50% align:center
I believe this more human
form will better allow me

00:15:07.157 --> 00:15:09.075 position:50% align:center
to feel your love
with my whole being.

00:15:09.159 --> 00:15:13.204 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] This world is still
full of mysteries, I see.

00:15:13.288 --> 00:15:14.622 position:50% align:center
That is too close!

00:15:14.706 --> 00:15:15.957 position:50% align:center
And at least hide your shame!

00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:17.375 position:50% align:center
I apologize, Mother.

00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:20.086 position:50% align:center
It's just been
30 whole years.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:21.671 position:50% align:center
Thirty years, huh?

00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:25.467 position:50% align:center
You had your fellow dragons,
but who did she have?

00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:31.473 position:50% align:center
The other day,
I rode Cleos's Garuda,

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:34.517 position:50% align:center
and I must say this
is far more relaxing!

00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:35.602 position:50% align:center
[EISENFALD]
I've dreamt of flying

00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:37.354 position:50% align:center
with you on my back, Mother.

00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:40.357 position:50% align:center
Let's make the most of it!

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.609 position:50% align:center
Are you comfortable on board?

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:43.902 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:46.154 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Are you kidding me?

00:16:00.794 --> 00:16:01.878 position:50% align:center
[EISENFALD]
Um.

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:03.505 position:50% align:center
Yes, what?

00:16:03.588 --> 00:16:05.840 position:50% align:center
[EISENFALD]
Will you summon me again soon?

00:16:05.924 --> 00:16:07.258 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Of course.

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:14.349 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
That's it.

00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:16.351 position:50% align:center
I can't keep putting
this off forever.

00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:18.561 position:50% align:center
I can't continue to lie
to the one who is closest

00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:20.522 position:50% align:center
and most loyal to me.

00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:28.029 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Miss Mira!
Hello, welcome back.

00:16:31.408 --> 00:16:33.702 position:50% align:center
You look troubled. What's wrong?

00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:36.579 position:50% align:center
Uh. Nothing. I'm just tired.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.210 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] This is making me
feel rather nervous.

00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:44.546 position:50% align:center
You know what? I'm parched
from my journey.

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:45.964 position:50% align:center
Could you make tea?

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:47.173 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA]
Certainly.

00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:53.513 position:50% align:center
Perfect. Not that
I'd expect less.

00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:56.808 position:50% align:center
You know exactly how I take
all my food and drinks.

00:16:56.891 --> 00:16:58.226 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:16:58.309 --> 00:17:00.145 position:50% align:center
But really, it's only because
you and Master Danblf

00:17:00.228 --> 00:17:01.771 position:50% align:center
share the same tastes.

00:17:02.814 --> 00:17:05.233 position:50% align:center
Yes, I suppose so!

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:07.444 position:50% align:center
Um. By the way.

00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:09.404 position:50% align:center
Speaking of Danblf...

00:17:11.406 --> 00:17:13.575 position:50% align:center
The truth is, I, uh--

00:17:13.658 --> 00:17:14.701 position:50% align:center
Yes, I know.

00:17:14.784 --> 00:17:17.912 position:50% align:center
Uh-- What? You do? Really?

00:17:17.996 --> 00:17:19.205 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
When did she find out?

00:17:19.289 --> 00:17:21.374 position:50% align:center
Could Cleos have told her?

00:17:21.458 --> 00:17:22.834 position:50% align:center
Yup! Though he keeps it secret,

00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:24.961 position:50% align:center
I know Master Danblf
loves waffles!

00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:26.546 position:50% align:center
So you do, too?

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:28.757 position:50% align:center
He especially likes it when I
practically drown them in cream.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.593 position:50% align:center
That's right! Quite the
character, that guy!

00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:34.262 position:50% align:center
He looks like a man of such
importance and gravitas,

00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:36.181 position:50% align:center
but his tastes are
that of a child!

00:17:36.264 --> 00:17:37.807 position:50% align:center
It always makes me laugh.

00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:40.477 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] That was terrifying.
I misunderstood.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.978 position:50% align:center
Not good for my heart.

00:17:42.062 --> 00:17:43.271 position:50% align:center
Oh. Since we're on the subject,

00:17:43.355 --> 00:17:45.190 position:50% align:center
would you like some
waffles, Miss Mira?

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:47.942 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Um, sure!

00:17:48.026 --> 00:17:48.985 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA]
There you are.

00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:51.529 position:50% align:center
I hope you enjoy.

00:17:51.613 --> 00:17:52.697 position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:17:52.781 --> 00:17:54.074 position:50% align:center
But before I partake,
there's something

00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:56.868 position:50% align:center
I've been meaning to tell you,
and it cannot wait.

00:17:56.951 --> 00:17:58.411 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA]
What is it?

00:17:58.495 --> 00:18:00.246 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:01.998 position:50% align:center
The truth is, I...

00:18:02.082 --> 00:18:04.292 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA] Don't worry!
I'll take care of it!

00:18:04.376 --> 00:18:05.919 position:50% align:center
Jeez! To think you
even have that

00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:08.046 position:50% align:center
in common with Master Danblf.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:11.925 position:50% align:center
I assume, like him,

00:18:12.008 --> 00:18:14.094 position:50% align:center
you have a hard time with
hot foods as well, right?

00:18:14.177 --> 00:18:15.345 position:50% align:center
Right again!

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:17.514 position:50% align:center
In fact, my master and I
often found ourselves

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:19.140 position:50% align:center
blowing on each other's food!

00:18:19.224 --> 00:18:21.851 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I'm a bit
envious of you for that.

00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:24.771 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I am utterly failing to
find the right time to tell her.

00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:26.773 position:50% align:center
What do I do?

00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:29.234 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA] Um, would you
excuse me for a moment?

00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:33.238 position:50% align:center
There's something I'd like
to get and show you.

00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:36.074 position:50% align:center
I'm still in the process
of making them, but...

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:37.742 position:50% align:center
I wanted to sew
matching outfits.

00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:40.537 position:50% align:center
You know, for yourself
and Master Danblf.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.872 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you're aware,
but once Master Danblf

00:18:42.956 --> 00:18:44.541 position:50% align:center
takes a liking to an outfit,

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:46.626 position:50% align:center
he tends to wear it
for a long time.

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:49.045 position:50% align:center
I tried my best to keep
his taste in clothes in mind

00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:51.297 position:50% align:center
while designing it, but I
thought I should check in

00:18:51.381 --> 00:18:53.049 position:50% align:center
with you as well, Miss Mira.

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:55.593 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
I see. I think it looks good!

00:18:55.677 --> 00:18:57.679 position:50% align:center
Not that I can speak
for him, of course.

00:18:57.762 --> 00:18:59.848 position:50% align:center
Aw, thank you very much.

00:18:59.931 --> 00:19:02.684 position:50% align:center
Obviously, I didn't make
them both exactly the same.

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:06.438 position:50% align:center
For yours, Miss Mira, I thought
I'd add a cute little...

00:19:06.521 --> 00:19:10.066 position:50% align:center
...ribbon right here for fun.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:10.984 position:50% align:center
Mariana?

00:19:11.067 --> 00:19:13.278 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA]
Please pardon me.

00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:18.491 position:50% align:center
I was just hoping that Master
Danblf would return soon.

00:19:18.575 --> 00:19:20.201 position:50% align:center
That is enough.

00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:23.329 position:50% align:center
You need only make
the one outfit for me.

00:19:23.413 --> 00:19:25.707 position:50% align:center
Why would you say
something like that?

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:29.502 position:50% align:center
It's because I am
not Danblf's pupil.

00:19:29.586 --> 00:19:32.505 position:50% align:center
Rather, I am Danblf himself.

00:19:33.548 --> 00:19:35.675 position:50% align:center
Huh? Yes, whatever you say!

00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:38.219 position:50% align:center
I'll go prepare another
cup of tea for you. Okay?

00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:40.472 position:50% align:center
This isn't a joke, okay?

00:19:40.555 --> 00:19:43.850 position:50% align:center
I'm him! I'm Danblf!

00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:47.228 position:50% align:center
You're serious? How do you mean?

00:19:47.312 --> 00:19:50.273 position:50% align:center
Because of a fluke,
I ended up looking like this.

00:19:50.357 --> 00:19:54.110 position:50% align:center
The name "Mira" is an alias
made to suit my appearance.

00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:55.612 position:50% align:center
I wanted to tell you
the truth after

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:57.739 position:50% align:center
everything you've done for me.

00:19:57.822 --> 00:19:59.157 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.243 position:50% align:center
Sorry to ask, but do you have
proof you could show me?

00:20:02.327 --> 00:20:03.536 position:50% align:center
A good question.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.998 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Uh, what would suffice?

00:20:07.082 --> 00:20:09.626 position:50% align:center
I know! How about
the Fairy's Grace?

00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:11.002 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA]
That?

00:20:11.086 --> 00:20:13.046 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] The Fairy's Grace
is a covenant that fairies,

00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:15.924 position:50% align:center
such as yourself, enter into
with someone they deem worthy

00:20:16.007 --> 00:20:18.176 position:50% align:center
of devoting their
life to, remember?

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:20.845 position:50% align:center
You and I have already
done so long ago.

00:20:20.929 --> 00:20:23.181 position:50% align:center
So if that Grace
could be renewed,

00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:25.016 position:50% align:center
would that not serve as proof?

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.185 position:50% align:center
Yes. It would.

00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:29.104 position:50% align:center
Shall we try, then?

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:35.193 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA gasps]

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:54.170 position:50% align:center
It worked. Then that means...

00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:55.463 position:50% align:center
There we go! Believe me now?

00:20:55.547 --> 00:20:59.050 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA cries]
Finally.

00:20:59.134 --> 00:21:01.594 position:50% align:center
You've come back to me at last.

00:21:07.017 --> 00:21:08.476 position:50% align:center
I'm truly sorry.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.894 position:50% align:center
Since I woke up
looking like this,

00:21:09.978 --> 00:21:11.354 position:50% align:center
I didn't know what to tell you.

00:21:11.438 --> 00:21:12.731 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA]
You're terrible!

00:21:12.814 --> 00:21:14.816 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter
what you look like.

00:21:14.899 --> 00:21:16.317 position:50% align:center
You're still you!

00:21:16.401 --> 00:21:17.902 position:50% align:center
Your appearance wouldn't
change the fact

00:21:17.986 --> 00:21:20.071 position:50% align:center
that I'd serve you for life!

00:21:20.155 --> 00:21:24.284 position:50% align:center
It's all right now. I'm here
with you, don't worry.

00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:26.077 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA]
Master Danblf.

00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:27.328 position:50% align:center
Please.

00:21:27.412 --> 00:21:30.540 position:50% align:center
While I look like this,
you may call me Mira.

00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:33.960 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA]
Yes. Mast-- Miss Mira.

00:21:37.172 --> 00:21:39.215 position:50% align:center
Unsurprisingly, I'm exhausted.

00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:42.010 position:50% align:center
Turning in early is
for the best today.

00:21:42.093 --> 00:21:45.138 position:50% align:center
Mariana, you were ecstatic, huh?

00:21:46.765 --> 00:21:47.682 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA]
Miss Mira.

00:21:47.766 --> 00:21:49.392 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Uh, yes?

00:21:49.476 --> 00:21:50.894 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA]
Are you going to sleep already?

00:21:50.977 --> 00:21:52.145 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
I suppose I am.

00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:54.189 position:50% align:center
Is something the matter?

00:21:54.272 --> 00:21:56.399 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA] Pardon me for
disturbing your evening.

00:21:56.483 --> 00:21:59.652 position:50% align:center
I came hoping to share your bed,
if that's okay with you.

00:21:59.736 --> 00:22:01.196 position:50% align:center
Wait. You what?

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:03.656 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA]
I must say,

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.950 position:50% align:center
I was surprised
by your appearance.

00:22:06.034 --> 00:22:08.370 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Truth be told, so was I.

00:22:08.453 --> 00:22:10.622 position:50% align:center
Although, it's only thanks
to the way you look

00:22:10.705 --> 00:22:14.626 position:50% align:center
right now that I'm comfortable
sleeping side-by-side like this.

00:22:14.709 --> 00:22:16.961 position:50% align:center
You have a point.
I mean, look at me.

00:22:17.045 --> 00:22:18.380 position:50% align:center
I am a girl.

00:22:18.463 --> 00:22:20.757 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for asking
to stay here tonight.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:24.886 position:50% align:center
It's just, you'll be traveling
again soon, won't you?

00:22:24.969 --> 00:22:26.179 position:50% align:center
Forgive me.

00:22:26.262 --> 00:22:27.722 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA]
Oh. There's no need.

00:22:27.806 --> 00:22:31.518 position:50% align:center
I just haven't seen you
in 30 years, so...

00:22:31.601 --> 00:22:33.061 position:50% align:center
With our limited time,

00:22:33.144 --> 00:22:35.980 position:50% align:center
I wanted to be close to your
heart in whatever way I could,

00:22:36.064 --> 00:22:39.150 position:50% align:center
whether big or small,
and I got kind of overwhelmed.

00:22:39.234 --> 00:22:40.902 position:50% align:center
I don't mind.

00:22:40.985 --> 00:22:45.657 position:50% align:center
When you're overwhelmed, I'll
be there for you every time.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:47.242 position:50% align:center
Miss Mira.

00:22:53.832 --> 00:22:56.501 position:50% align:center
[MARIANA]
Miss Mira, good night.

00:22:56.584 --> 00:23:00.005 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Mm. Good night, Mariana.
