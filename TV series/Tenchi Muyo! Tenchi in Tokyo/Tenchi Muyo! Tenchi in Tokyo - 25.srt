1
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,458
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:45,583
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,291
- Sakuya: TENCHI,
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

4
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,416
I HAD A WONDERFUL TIME TODAY.

5
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:28,750
I'VE COME TO REALIZE THAT...

6
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,041
EVEN THOUGH I STILL CAN'T
REMEMBER MY PAST,

7
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,500
IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE,

8
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,875
BECAUSE I'M CREATING
NEW MAGICAL MEMORIES

9
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,375
EVERY TIME I'M WITH YOU.

10
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,875
AND I KNOW AS TIME GOES ON,

11
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,958
WE'LL HAVE MORE AND MORE
OF THEM TO SHARE.

12
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,625
WE'LL GO TO THE OCTOBER FEST,

13
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,541
AND GO ON
ALL THE RIDES TOGETHER.

14
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:47,166
AND ON CHRISTMAS,
WE'LL GIVE EACH OTHER PRESENTS.

15
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,833
OH, AND WE CAN VISIT THE SHINTO
SHRINE ON NEW YEAR'S DAY.

16
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,791
I THINK I WAS BORN TO FALL
IN LOVE WITH YOU, TENCHI. 

17
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,750
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS
TO ME NOW, TENCHI.

18
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,208
EVERY DAY MY LOVE FOR YOU

19
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,166
IS BECOMING MORE
AND MORE REAL.

20
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,500
- ( meows )
- RYO-OHKI!

21
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,208
- Azaka: BE CAREFUL!

22
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,291
SHE'S A SORCERESS!

23
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,083
- WELL, I WARNED YOU.

24
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,833
I TOLD YOU THAT WHEN I PLAY,
I PLAY ROUGH.  HUH?

25
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,083
- ( murmurs )

26
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,416
- I WARN YOU, STAY AWAY!

27
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,666
THIS HOUSE IS TENCHI'S.

28
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,250
IT'S FOR TENCHI AND ME
TO SHARE OUR LIVES.

29
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,000
YOU CAN'T COME BETWEEN US,
MATORI!

30
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,750
I WON'T LET YOU GET
NEAR OUR HOME.

31
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,250
- OH.

32
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,125
WELL, LET'S SEE HOW CLOSE
I CAN GET.

33
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,625
YAH!
- ( grunts )

34
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,250
( gasps )

35
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,833
Ayeka: I WON'T DO IT.

36
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,500
I'LL NEVER GIVE IN.

37
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,375
OH, TENCHI.

38
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,291
- ( chuckles )

39
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,750
- ( screams )

40
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,875
- ( all gasp )
- AHH.

41
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,833
- Ayeka: OH, TENCHI.

42
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:00,166
( grunts )

43
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,500
- OH MY!  AYEKA!

44
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,333
- REALITY'S HARSH,
BUT THAT'S HOW IT IS.

45
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,291
- WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!

46
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,291
( gasps )

47
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,625
- ( groans )

48
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:23,833
- ( meows )

49
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,500
( meows )

50
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,666
- RYO-OHKI, PLEASE TELL
TENCHI AND WASHU.

51
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,416
- Washu:
SASAMI'S BEEN KIDNAPPED,

52
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,083
AND AYEKA IS INJURED?

53
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,208
- ( meows )

54
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,500
- BUT WHY?

55
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,000
TENCHI'S THE ONE WHO
WILL SUCCEED ME

56
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,208
AS PLANET GUARDIAN.

57
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,250
WHY WOULD THEY KIDNAP
SASAMI AND NOT HIM?

58
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,875
- Tenchi: AYEKA, SASAMI...

59
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,833
- Yugi: SASAMI...

60
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,541
STAY HERE WITH ME.

61
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,708
I DON'T NEED ANYTHING ELSE.

62
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:54,750
PEOPLE, TOWNS,

63
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,166
THE OCEAN, THE SKY,
AND THE STARS.

64
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,208
I DON'T NEED ANY OF THEM
IF YOU ARE HERE.

65
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,666
COME ON.

66
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,458
LET'S MAKE THIS
A SPECIAL WORLD

67
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,708
JUST FOR YOU AND ME.

68
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,625
SASAMI?

69
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,041
- HUH?  WHAT IS THIS?

70
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:50,250
- YUGI IS ENTERING THE WORLD
FROM HER DIMENSION.

71
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,916
APPARENTLY, TIME HAS FROZEN

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,958
AS A RESULT
OF THAT PHENOMENON.

73
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,750
WE WOULD HAVE BEEN FROZEN
ALONG WITH EVERYTHING ELSE,

74
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,625
BUT THESE JEWELS ARE
PROTECTING US FROM HARM.

75
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,291
- YUGI.

76
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:02,291
( groans )

77
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,083
- TENCHI, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

78
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,750
YOU DON'T INTEND TO CONFRONT
YUGI BY YOURSELF, DO YOU?

79
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,166
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

80
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,625
SHE'S TOO POWERFUL, BELIEVE ME.

81
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,625
IF SHE CAN FREEZE TIME
ON A WHOLE PLANET,

82
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,500
IMAGINE WHAT SHE CAN DO
TO ONE ENEMY.

83
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,750
- STAND ASIDE, WASHU.

84
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,250
- I'M NOT MOVING.

85
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,250
- ( groans )
- HMM?

86
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,166
- UH?
- THIS IS NO TIME

87
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,083
TO LET YOUR ANGER 
GET AWAY FROM YOU.

88
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,958
REMEMBER, YOU ARE A GUARDIAN
OF THIS PLANET.

89
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,958
YOU HAVE A VITAL
DUTY TO PERFORM.

90
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,333
- THE ONLY CHANCE WE HAVE

91
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,791
IS TO BRING
ALL THE GEMS TOGETHER.

92
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,416
THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE
GOT TO DO, TENCHI.

93
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,333
- SHE IS RIGHT, SON.
- ( growls )

94
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,708
LET ME GO!

95
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,500
- TENCHI!

96
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:51,708
- SORRY.

97
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,291
I KNOW YOU DON'T
WANT TO BE LOCKED UP,

98
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,083
BUT IT'S NECESSARY FOR NOW.

99
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,291
THIS ISN'T GOING
TO BE A PLEASANT SIGHT.

100
00:06:58,708 --> 00:06:59,958
YOU SEE, SASAMI,

101
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,291
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO EVER CALLED ME "FRIEND."

102
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:05,958
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO SMILED AT ME EVER.

103
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:09,333
THAT'S WHY I'M CHANGING
THIS WORLD FOR YOU!

104
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,041
I WANT IT TO BE
AN IDEAL PLACE 

105
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,375
FOR US TO PLAY.

106
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,250
IT'LL BE PERFECT.
JUST FOR YOU AND ME.

107
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,833
AND I'LL SEE YOU
SMILE AGAIN.

108
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,791
SASAMI...

109
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,375
- ( panting )

110
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:25,291
IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF ME.
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

111
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,708
HOW CAN I ASK THEM FOR HELP?

112
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,708
HOW CAN I EVEN FACE THEM?

113
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,708
I FELL FOR YUGI'S TRICKS.

114
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,166
I CAUSED THIS MESS.

115
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,500
AYEKA, RYOKO,
AND EVERYONE ELSE.

116
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:40,916
EVEN SASAMI.

117
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,250
THEY'RE ALL IN TROUBLE
BECAUSE OF ME.

118
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,333
I CAN'T ASK THEM
TO HELP ME NOW. 

119
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,875
I-- I JUST CAN'T.

120
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,416
- Sakuya: TENCHI...

121
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,083
- ( panting )

122
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,000
YUGI!

123
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,750
- HAVE A BLAST.

124
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,208
IS THAT IT?

125
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,375
( gasps )

126
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,333
- ( chuckles )

127
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,291
- ( grunts )

128
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,541
- ( growls )

129
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,916
- YOU'RE MINE NOW,
LOVER BOY.

130
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,875
- ( growls )

131
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,583
- ( explosion )

132
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,916
- ( grunts )
- ( chuckles )

133
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:41,208
- HUH?
- FAREWELL.

134
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,416
- AAH.
( chuckles )

135
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,083
YOU GIRLS AREN'T TOO BAD,
I MUST SAY.

136
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,833
- ( both panting )

137
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,375
- ( grunts )

138
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:54,708
- OKAY.  I THINK I'VE HAD
ENOUGH OF THIS FOR NOW.

139
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,208
HERE!
- ( both scream )

140
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,583
- ( pants )

141
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,000
- SAKUYA, YES.

142
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,958
Tenchi: SHE WAS THERE,
RIGHT NEXT TO ME.

143
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,583
HER SMILE,
THE WAY HER EYES SPARKLED.

144
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:26,958
THAT WAS NO ILLUSION.

145
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:30,791
SHE'S NOT JUST A SHADOW.
SHE WAS REALLY THERE.

146
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:34,250
YUGI, YOU CAN'T
TAKE THAT AWAY FROM ME.

147
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,250
YOU CAN'T.  SHE'S REAL.
I JUST KNOW IT.

148
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,500
SHE HAS TO BE.

149
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:42,125
THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF 
YUGI'S SINISTER TRICKS.

150
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,500
- ( chuckles )

151
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,875
( laughs )

152
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,583
- YOU!

153
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,250
( shouts )

154
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,041
- ( panting )

155
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,208
- ( growls )

( chuckles )

157
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,625
- ( gasps )

158
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,416
TENCHI...

159
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,375
- ( laughs )

160
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,041
- ( Mihoshi and Kiyone shout )

161
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,333
- ( grunting )

162
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,958
- HERE HE COMES.

163
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,166
HE IS QUITE PERSISTENT.

164
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,166
Yugi:
LET HIM COME HERE, MATORI.

165
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,666
- HUH?
- IT'LL BE AN INTERESTING SHOW.

166
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,291
SIT BACK AND ENJOY IT.

167
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,666
- ( shouts )

168
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,166
- OHH.

169
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,208
( grunts )

170
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,791
- COULD YOU BELIEVE THAT GUY
IN THE CAFETERIA?

171
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,541
HE SPILLED EVERYTHING.

172
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,208
- I THINK
HE DID IT ON PURPOSE.

173
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,541
- HE LOOKED SO FUNNY.
- I KNOW.

174
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,208
- TALK ABOUT DESPERATE
FOR ATTENTION.

175
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,250
- AT LEAST HE WAS
HAVING FUN.

176
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,875
- SAKUYA.
- ( laughs )

177
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,041
- WAIT.

178
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,125
( murmurs )

179
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,875
- ( meows )

180
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:46,625
- ( clock ringing )

181
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,625
- SAKUYA, ARE YOU--?

182
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:51,833
- HMM?

183
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:52,958
HEY, WHAT'S WRONG?

184
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,041
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU SAW A GHOST.

185
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,583
- TELL ME--

186
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,625
I MEAN, SAKUYA...

187
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,541
- Yugi:
IS SOMETHING WRONG, TENCHI?

188
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,000
DON'T WORRY.

189
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,541
SINCE YOU CAME
TO MY CASTLE, 

190
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,000
I THOUGHT I'D 
ENTERTAIN YOU.

191
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,625
BUT IF YOU DON'T
LIKE THAT SHOW, 

192
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:08,916
LET'S TRY ANOTHER SCENE.

193
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,583
- AAH.

194
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,875
- ( chuckles )

195
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,958
HOW COME YOU'RE LOOKING
SO SURPRISED, TENCHI?

196
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,875
SINCE THIS WORLD
IS MY CREATION, 

197
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,958
I CAN DO ANYTHING
I WANT WITH IT.

198
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,166
AND MY SHADOW IS 
UNDER MY CONTROL.

199
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,375
- ( growls )

200
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,291
YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS!

201
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,791
- TENCHI?  HI.

202
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:32,958
YOU LOOK UPSET.

203
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,208
ARE YOU OKAY?

204
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,583
- THERE.

205
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,583
I'LL JUST LEAVE YOU
HERE WITH HER.

206
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:43,833
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

207
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,666
THIS WORLD IS
JUST FOR YOU TWO.

208
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,708
YOU CAN STAY HERE
WITH HER FOREVER,

209
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,916
OR ARE YOU WILLING
TO SACRIFICE YOUR DEAR SAKUYA

210
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,916
TO SAVE THIS PITIFUL PLANET?

211
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,666
( laughs )

212
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,125
- ( growls )

213
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,083
( grunts )

214
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,708
WHAT?!

215
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,250
- ( gasps )

216
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,250
( chuckles )

217
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,833
- ( grunts )

218
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,791
- YOU JUST DON'T GET IT,
DO YOU?

219
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,000
IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW UGLY YOU GET,

220
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:22,541
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO
TO CHANGE HOW I FEEL FOR TENCHI.

221
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,041
- ( shouts )

222
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,833
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
HOTSUMA,

223
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,416
THOUGH YOU WON'T UNDERSTAND.

224
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,458
- ( grunting )

225
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,500
- TENCHI'S HEART IS GENTLE.

226
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:34,541
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

227
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,166
I DON'T CARE WHO HE'S WITH.

228
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,708
BECAUSE IT'S MY LOVE FOR HIM

229
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,666
THAT GIVES ME
THE STRENGTH TO TRIUMPH!

230
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,000
- ( Hotsuma shouts )

231
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,541
- DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE ALL WORN OUT.

232
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,166
A COUPLE OF TOUGH
SPACE BABES LIKE YOU?

233
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,375
- MIHOSHI, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
RESORT TO EXTREME MEASURES.

234
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,833
- ( gasps )

235
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,708
YOU'RE NOT PUTTING THAT
IN YOUR BLASTER?

236
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,125
- JUST A SIMPLE
ANTI-MATTER EXPLOSIVE.

237
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,458
- IT'S EXPERIMENTAL.

238
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,208
YOU HAVE TO GET
PERMISSION FROM HEADQUARTERS

239
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,583
FOR THAT KIND OF THING.

240
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,583
- THERE'S NO TIME
TO WORRY ABOUT FORMALITIES.

241
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,083
HERE.

242
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,416
I'LL BE THE DECOY 
AND DRAW HIS FIRE.

243
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,416
YOU'VE GOT TO 
MAKE THE SHOT.

244
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,000
- KIYONE...

245
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,625
- HUH?
( gasps )

246
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,250
( chuckles )
CAN'T YOU DO BETTER THAN THAT?

247
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,375
COME ON NOW, GIRLS.
LET'S FINISH IT!

248
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:27,833
- AAH!

249
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,500
( breathing heavily )

250
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:37,750
- HUH?

251
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,375
- ( shudders )

252
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,625
- MIHOSHI.

253
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,416
YOU THREW YOURSELF
IN FRONT OF ME.

254
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,416
- KIYONE,

255
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,083
WATCH OUT.

256
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,416
OOH!

257
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,875
( grunts )

258
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,791
- ( laughing )

259
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,625
- ( gasps )

260
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:01,708
( grunts )

261
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,708
AH!  YOU'RE GONNA
PAY FOR THAT.

262
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,083
- ( gasps )

263
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,708
( panting )

264
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:12,000
( screams )

265
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,458
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, MIHOSHI.

266
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,125
WE CAN GO HOME NOW.

267
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,041
- THEN CAN WE EAT SOMETHING?

268
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,458
- ( music playing )

269
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,166
- THAT'S RIGHT, TENCHI.

270
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,833
JUST RELAX AND LEAVE
EVERYTHING TO ME.

271
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,333
PLAY YOUR PART,

272
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:10,875
AND YOU AND SAKUYA
CAN BE TOGETHER FOR ETERNITY.

273
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:15,541
IT LOOKS LIKE I'VE WON,
SASAMI.

274
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,208
- IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

275
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,708
- YEAH.

276
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,250
- I HOPE WE CAN
DO THIS AGAIN NEXT YEAR.

277
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,041
JUST THE TWO OF US.

278
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,208
- THAT'D BE NICE.

279
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,875
- NEXT YEAR, WHEN WE GO
TO SEE THE CHERRY BLOSSOMS,

280
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,500
I'LL MAKE A SPECIAL
LUNCH BASKET.

281
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:38,875
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?

282
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,750
( gasps )

283
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,000
- LISTEN TO ME.

284
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,791
YOU SAID THAT YOU LOVED ME

285
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,750
AND YOU WANT TO
BE TOGETHER.

286
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,166
BUT I HAVEN'T HAD
A CHANCE TO TELL YOU

287
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,791
THE WAY I FEEL YET.

288
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,583
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO KEEP YOU GUESSING,

289
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,750
BUT I HAD TO REALLY
LISTEN TO MY HEART.

290
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,250
AND WELL,

291
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,916
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU TOO...

292
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,208
SAKUYA.

293
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,541
- TENCHI.

294
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,583
- HUH?

295
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,583
- Sakuya: I'M SO HAPPY.

296
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,541
I'VE WAITED SO LONG
FOR THIS MOMENT.

297
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,500
BUT I'M AFRAID
I HAVE TO GO AWAY NOW.

298
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,291
- SAKUYA?

299
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,541
- I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

300
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,083
OF COURSE...

301
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,500
IT'S SUCH A PITY.

302
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:46,000
BUT WE'VE HAD
A GREAT TIME.

303
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:49,458
TOO BAD WE CAN'T
JUST DREAM ON.

304
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,416
- WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO PULL ON ME?

305
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,750
I DON'T NEED YOU ANYMORE!

306
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,833
YOU'RE FINISHED!

307
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,166
- SAKUYA!

308
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,916
LET ME TELL YOU.

309
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,500
- NO.  YOU DON'T NEED
TO SAY ANYTHING.

310
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,958
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

311
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,958
NO MATTER HOW BEAUTIFUL
AND JOYFUL THIS MAY SEEM,

312
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,750
IT'S ONLY A DREAM WORLD.

313
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,041
AND PEOPLE CAN'T
LIVE ON ILLUSIONS.

314
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:16,000
TENCHI, YOU HAVE AN IMPORTANT
MISSION TO ACCOMPLISH.

315
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,666
PEOPLE ARE DEPENDING ON YOU,

316
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,958
AND YOUR HOME
IS WAITING FOR YOU.

317
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,500
THE TIME WE'VE 
SPENT TOGETHER,

318
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,333
EVERY SMILE,
EVERY TOUCH,

319
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,333
ALL THE HOPES AND DREAMS
WE HAD FOR THE FUTURE,

320
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,333
I WILL CHERISH THEM ALL.

321
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,875
I WILL TREASURE
EVERY MEMORY.

322
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,875
AND MY TREASURE
WILL REMAIN RIGHT HERE.

323
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,666
I HAVE IT ALL NOW, TENCHI.

324
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,000
I WON'T WONDER
ABOUT MY PAST,

325
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,625
AND I WON'T FEEL LONELY
EVER AGAIN.

326
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,125
- GO AWAY!

327
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:02,375
- THEN I GUESS I MUST LEAVE.

328
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,041
