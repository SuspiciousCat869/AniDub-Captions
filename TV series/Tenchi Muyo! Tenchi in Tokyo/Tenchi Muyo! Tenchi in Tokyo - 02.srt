1
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:34,583
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,625
- ( birds chirping )

3
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:13,125
- MM.

4
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,750
MY HAND'S ASLEEP.

5
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,375
MM.

6
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,416
HMM?

7
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,083
- ( chuckles )

8
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:31,041
- ( moaning )
- SO HOW IS IT GOING, LOVER?

9
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,708
- ( Tenchi screams )

10
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,583
YOU SCARED ME, RYOKO.
WHY ARE YOU IN MY BED?

11
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,875
- I THOUGHT I'D DROP IN
AND CHECK THE MATTRESS.

12
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:45,125
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
IT WAS COMFORTABLE ENOUGH FOR ME

13
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,708
IF I EVER DECIDE
TO SLEEP OVER.

14
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,875
- SLEEPING OVER?  YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE SLEEPING OVER.

15
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,583
YOU'RE NOT EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE
HERE WITHOUT A CHAPERONE!

16
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:54,750
- OH, I HAVE SEVERAL.
- I BEG YOUR PARDON?

17
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,250
- THERE.
- HUH?

18
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:01,291
- BREAKFAST IS READY.

19
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,750
- YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING.

20
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,375
MM!

21
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,791
- GOOD MORNING, SLEEPYHEAD.

22
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,291
- ALL TOGETHER.
- GOOD MORNING, SLEEPYHEAD.

23
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,583
- GOOD MORNING, GIRLS.

24
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,458
- IT'S TIME
FOR BREAKFAST.

25
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:15,375
- OH, SOY SAUCE-- COULD YOU
PASS IT OVER, PLEASE, MIHOSHI?

26
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,750
- OKAY.  HUH?

27
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,166
- HEY, BE CAREFUL, MIHOSHI.
YOU'RE SPILLING THINGS.

28
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,541
- I COULD PICK IT UP.

29
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,250
- THE PICKLED RADISH
IS GREAT.

30
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,583
- I'M GLAD
YOU LIKE IT.

31
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,416
- OH, THERE'S SOMETHING
I SHOULD TELL YOU, TENCHI.

32
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,583
I CONNECTED ONE END OF MY
INTERDIMENSIONAL TUNNEL

33
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,375
TO YOUR BED, AND THE OTHER END
TO YOUR DAD'S HOUSE.

34
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,541
I HOPE
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

35
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:31,708
- WHAT?

36
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,666
- COME AND EAT, TENCHI.
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

37
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,583
TODAY'S MISO SOUP HAS TOFU
AND POTATOES IN IT.

38
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,291
- COME AND SIT OVER HERE,
TENCHI.

39
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,166
- THERE'S AN OPEN SEAT
RIGHT NEXT TO ME, TENCHI.

40
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,208
- NOT NOW.

41
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,666
- ( screams )

42
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,375
- ( grunts )

43
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,958
- HUH?
- MEOW?

44
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,958
- RYOKO, YOU SHOULDN'T BE
SO VIOLENT

45
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,416
WHEN YOU DON'T
GET YOUR WAY.

46
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,000
- I WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE
SO VIOLENT

47
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,916
IF YOU JUST STOPPED
INTERFERING.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,375
- ( both growling )

49
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:58,458
- WILL YOU TWO STOP ALL THIS?
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.

50
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,458
I DON'T LIKE EITHER OF YOU
BETTER THAN THE OTHER.

51
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,291
- STAY OUT OF THIS.
WE'LL DECIDE WHO YOU LIKE BEST.

52
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,750
- ( objects crashing )

53
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,666
- Kamidake: IT'S SUCH A PEACEFUL
AND QUIET MORNING, ISN'T IT?

54
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,666
- Azaka: I HOPE THE PRINCESS IS
ENJOYING IT AS MUCH AS WE ARE.

55
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,666
- HUH?

56
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,833
UH-HUH, IT'S AN OMEN.

57
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,791
- DON'T FORGET TO CLEAN UP
WHEN YOU LEAVE.

58
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,625
- Girls: SEE YOU LATER, TENCHI.
BYE-BYE, TENCHI.

59
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:26,666
- THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED.
- Girls: BYE-BYE NOW.

60
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,666
- ( water running )

61
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,708
- ( humming a tune )

62
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:40,416
OH, ONCE TENCHI LEAVES,
I HAVE TO ADMIT,

63
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,416
IT'S KIND OF BORING
AROUND HERE.

64
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,708
- MEOW, MEOW, MEOW,
MEOW, MEOW, MEOW.

65
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,333
- THIS AD SAYS THEY'RE PAYING
970 YEN AN HOUR

66
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,958
TO PLAY A VILLAIN
ON "THE HERO SHOW."

67
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,375
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD
MONEY.

68
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,416
I THINK I'LL GO DOWN THERE
AND SIGN UP TO BE A STAR.

69
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,958
- YOU MIGHT NEED
SOME EXPERIENCE.

70
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,166
HAVE YOU ACTED
BEFORE?

71
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,666
- NOT REALLY.
DOES IT MATTER?

72
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,750
- I WONDER IF TENCHI'S
DOING OKAY.

73
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,916
I MEAN, HE COULD HAVE FALLEN
AND INJURED HIMSELF.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,041
I WORRY ABOUT HIM GETTING SICK
FROM FOOD POISONING

75
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,208
OR BAD WATER.
WHAT IF HE'S LOST SOMEWHERE?

76
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:09,250
- OH, COME ON, STOP BEING
SUCH A WORRYWART HOG.

77
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,541
- I'M NOT WORRIED.
- POOR TENCHI,

78
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,916
HE WAS HIT BY A CAR ON HIS WAY
TO SCHOOL THIS MORNING.

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,708
- ( crash )
- ( Ayeka whimpering )

80
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,208
- AFTER THAT HE WAS KIDNAPPED
BY VIDEO PIRATES.

81
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,458
- ( punches landing )
- OH MY.

82
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,833
- IT'S POSSIBLE HE WAS PICKED UP
BY A VICIOUS WOMAN.

83
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,958
- HE'S JUST NOT INTERESTED
IN ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP.

84
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,916
- I FORGOT, YOU'RE VICIOUS
ENOUGH FOR ANYONE.

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,125
- ( Ayeka growling )
- BACK OFF, LADY.

86
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,708
- Ryoko: HMM?
- Ayeka: HEY, WAIT.

87
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,583
WHERE ARE YOU GOING
WITH THAT THING, WASHU?

88
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,041
- THAT BABY'S
IMPORTANT TO US.

89
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,625
WE DON'T WANT ANYTHING
TO HAPPEN TO IT.

90
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,708
- I'VE JUST STABILIZED THIS END
OF MY INTERDIMENSIONAL TUNNEL.

91
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,500
I CAN STABILIZE THE OTHER END
BY PICKING A TRANSIT POINT.

92
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,500
- I DIDN'T KNOW THE TUNNEL
WAS SO PORTABLE.

93
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,000
- SURE.
- CAN I SEE?

94
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,666
OH, YEAH, IT ENDS UP
IN TENCHI'S BED.

95
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,166
- RIGHT.

96
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,500
- HMM, IF THAT TUNNEL ENTRANCE
WAS SET UP IN MY ROOM,

97
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,625
I COULD VISIT TENCHI
WHENEVER I WANTED.

98
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,833
- IF I CONTROLLED THAT TUNNEL,
I COULD SEE TENCHI

99
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,458
WITHOUT ALL THESE BUSYBODIES
TAGGING ALONG.

100
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:04,541
- OH, WASHU, MY DEAR, COULD YOU
DO A LITTLE FAVOR FOR ME?

101
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,541
- WHAT A COINCIDENCE.
I NEED ONE TOO.

102
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,583
- WHAT?
- OH, IT'S NOTHING REALLY BIG.

103
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,291
COULD YOU ESTABLISH THE ENTRANCE
TO THE TUNNEL IN MY ROOM?

104
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,958
HUH?  WHAT'S THAT?

105
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,083
- I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
YOU'D PULL SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

106
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,625
YOU WERE GONNA USE
THE DIMENSIONAL TUNNEL

107
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,208
TO SLIP OVER THERE,
WEREN'T YOU?

108
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,625
- WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU WERE
PLANNING TO DO THE SAME THING.

109
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,666
YOU WANTED TENCHI
ALL TO YOURSELF, DIDN'T YOU?

110
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,458
- UH-OH.
- AND NOW ROUND FIVE.

111
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:28,583
- NOTHING EVER CHANGES.
- ( girls yelling )

112
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,000
- MM.
- Ayeka: TENCHI WANTS ME.

113
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,125
- Ryoko: NOT YOU,
NEVER-- NEVER!

114
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,250
- ( clock chiming )

115
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,958
- Boy: I'M SO HUNGRY,
I'LL EVEN EAT MYSTERY MEAT.

116
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,625
- ( students chattering )

117
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,791
- Girl: HEY, WAIT FOR ME.

118
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,666
- ( students laughing,
chattering )

119
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,208
- EVERYTHING IS SURE
SOPHISTICATED HERE.

120
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,000
IT'S SURE DIFFERENT
FROM THE COUNTRY.

121
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,625
- HI AND WELCOME.
HOW ARE YOU DOING, TENCHI?

122
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,208
ARE YOU FINDING IT
DIFFICULT TO ADJUST?

123
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,875
- HEY, IF YOU NEED HELP
WITH ANYTHING,

124
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,583
DON'T BE AFRAID TO ASK.
WE'RE ALWAYS AROUND.

125
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,958
- THANKS A LOT.
AND YOU ARE?

126
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,625
- I'M YOUR NEW CLASSMATE
UMANOSUKE TSUCHIDA.

127
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,625
I'VE BEEN TOLD YOU RECENTLY
MOVED TO TOWN

128
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,958
TO GO THROUGH AN APPRENTICESHIP
AT MY GRANDFATHER'S SHRINE.

129
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:13,583
- OH, SO YOU'RE THE GRANDSON
OF PRIEST DOKUZEN TSUCHIDA.

130
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,791
NICE MEETING YOU.

131
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,541
- HI. I'M KAZUHIKO AMAGASAKI.

132
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,666
- Sakuya: CAN YOU SCOOT OVER?
- WHAT?

133
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,083
- ( giggles )
DO YOU MIND?

134
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,833
- OH, PARDON ME.

135
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,333
- SAKUYA?

136
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:30,333
- IS IT ALL RIGHT?
IS THERE ROOM FOR ME?

137
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,666
- WELL, SURE.

138
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,708
- THANKS A LOT.

139
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,541
( giggles )

140
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,500
YOU HAVE NICE EYES.

141
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,208
- ( gulps )

142
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,708
- HUH?

143
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,791
- Boy: SHE'S EATING
WITH TENCHI.

144
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,083
- Umanosuke: WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE?

145
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,583
SAKUYA IS ONE OF THE MOST
POPULAR GIRLS IN SCHOOL.

146
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,541
EVERYONE WANTS TO BE
NOTICED BY HER.

147
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,750
WHAT'S SO SPECIAL
ABOUT HIM?

148
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,583
- ( chuckles )

149
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,666
( chuckling )

150
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,083
- ( grunting )

151
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,541
- ( grunting )

152
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,166
- GIVE IT UP.
LET GO.

153
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,291
- YOU LET GO.

154
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,000
- HEY, YOU TWO,
STOP PULLING ON IT.

155
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,166
YOU'RE GONNA
BREAK IT.

156
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,125
- WHAT ARE THEY
FIGHTING OVER NOW?

157
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,375
- EACH OF THEM
WANTS TO CONTROL

158
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,083
THE USE OF
THE DIMENSIONAL TUNNEL.

159
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,375
- IT'S NOT A FIGHT REALLY.
IT'S MORE LIKE A WAR.

160
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:32,583
- AYEKA, STOP PULLING IT.
- I'LL STOP WHEN YOU LET GO.

161
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,583
- Ayeka: OH.
- Washu: HUH?

162
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:37,916
- ( girls gasp )

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,083
OH.  WHOA.

164
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:43,458
WHOA.  OH.  WHOA.

165
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,250
- NOT GOOD.

166
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,875
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

167
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,000
- DOES THIS MEAN YOU HAVE TO
LEAVE IT UP THERE?

168
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,416
- WELL, IT'S ALREADY STABILIZED
IN THAT LOCATION.

169
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,916
IF WE WANT TO MOVE IT,
I'LL HAVE TO

170
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,583
START THE PROCESS
ALL OVER AGAIN.

171
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:58,916
- DON'T MOVE IT
FOR ME.

172
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,958
I DON'T HAVE
ANY PROBLEM WITH THIS.

173
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,916
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO PULL?

174
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,208
- I'M GOING TO SEE IF THIS
THING'S OPERATING PROPERLY.

175
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,125
- WAIT, I'M NOT LETTING YOU
CHECK OUT TENCHI'S ROOM

176
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,000
BY YOURSELF.

177
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,500
- ( girls groan )

178
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,833
- ( clock chiming )

179
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:25,666
- TENCHI, WAIT UP.

180
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,041
- HUH?  HI THERE,
MISS KUMASHIRO.

181
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,458
- CALL ME BY MY FIRST NAME.
- SAKUYA, RIGHT?

182
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,458
- MIND IF I WALK WITH YOU?
- UH, FINE.

183
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:33,791
- HMM?

184
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,125
HMM.

185
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,458
UNBELIEVABLE.

186
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,166
- HOW COME
HE'S SO LUCKY?

187
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,916
- Sakuya: SO WHERE'S
YOUR APARTMENT?

188
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,791
- I LIVE RIGHT UP THE STREE--
HEY!

189
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:57,750
- HUH?

190
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,750
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- MUSCLE CRAMP.

191
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,666
- TENCHI.
- FINALLY HOME, HUH?

192
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,541
WHAT'S THIS?

193
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,666
HE SEEMS TO HAVE
A GIRL WITH HIM.

194
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,500
- MAYBE SHE'S JUST
WALKING BY.

195
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,541
- IF I CAN GET PAST
THE APARTMENT...

196
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,125
- ( both exclaiming )

197
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,625
- ( girls gasp )

198
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,625
- HE'S PUTTING HIS ARMS
AROUND THAT GIRL.

199
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,166
- THIS IS
QUITE UNFORGIVABLE.

200
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,750
YOU WOMANIZER, HOW COULD YOU
GO OFF AND BETRAY ME?

201
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,208
- THANKS SO MUCH.
- SURE.  ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

202
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,208
- ( girls screaming )
- OH.

203
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,166
IF AYEKA AND RYOKO
MEET SAKUYA NOW,

204
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,458
SOMEONE'S GONNA
GET CREAMED,

205
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,333
AND I HAVE A FEELING
IT WON'T BE ONE OF THEM.

206
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,625
- ARGH!  SAKUYA, COME ON.
- ( grunts )

207
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,208
- TRYING TO RUN, HUH?
LET'S FOLLOW HIM, AYEKA.

208
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,583
- I HAD
THE SAME IDEA.

209
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,625
- ( both panting )

210
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,250
- WE'RE OKAY HERE.  THIS WILL BE
A SAFE PLACE TO REST.

211
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,041
WHERE ARE WE?

212
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,416
- AH, THIS IS THE FAMOUS
LOVE KNOT SHRINE.

213
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,458
- HUH?

214
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,750
- HA!  YOU'RE PRETTY SHARP.

215
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,208
YOU OBVIOUSLY BROUGHT ME HERE
ON PURPOSE.

216
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,541
- NO.  I MEAN,
I DIDN'T KNOW

217
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,041
ANYTHING ABOUT
THIS PLACE, HONEST.

218
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:12,000
- OH, SURE.
YOU'RE A SLY ONE, TENCHI.

219
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,958
- BUT, UH...

220
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,291
- ( giggling )

221
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,916
HEAR MY PRAYER,
LOVE GODDESS.

222
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,958
PLEASE MAKE TENCHI
LIKE ME,

223
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,083
SO WE CAN BE
BOYFRIEND AND GIRLFRIEND.

224
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,583
( gasps )

225
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,166
- Woman: I'VE HEARD YOUR PRAYER
AND IT SHALL BE ANSWERED.

226
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,500
- ( gasps )

227
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,875
( exclaims )

228
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,125
- HUH?

229
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,833
( both gasp )

230
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,375
- WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

231
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,875
- ( woman laughing )

232
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,125
YOU MADE A REQUEST
OF THE LOVE KNOT GODDESS

233
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,291
REGARDING YOUR
RELATIONSHIP?

234
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,166
AH, DIDN'T YOU?

235
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,166
WELL, YOUR REQUEST
IS GRANTED.

236
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,666
I'M HERE
TO TAKE CARE OF IT.

237
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,125
- WHO WOULD YOU BE?

238
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,958
- HEY, DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE
THE LOVE GODDESS?

239
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,500
I'M INE SUZUKI.

240
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,166
- MEOW!

241
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,791
- MEOW!

242
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,291
- ( whimpering )

243
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,958
- HOW COME
YOU'RE SO SCARED?

244
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,583
YOU CAME ASKING
FOR MY ASSISTANCE

245
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,583
AND I'VE SHOWN UP
IN RESPONSE TO YOUR PRAYER.

246
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,291
YOU WANT IT
TO COME TRUE?

247
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,666
- YEAH, OF COURSE.

248
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,125
- GOOD.  THEN ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS TRUST ME.

249
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,625
- ALL RIGHT!
- WHO'S THIS VERY SMALL PERSON?

250
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,458
- SHE HAPPENS TO BE
THE LOVE GODDESS. ( giggles )

251
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,666
- THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M A GODDESS OF TRUE LOVE.

252
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,666
LET ME DEMONSTRATE
SOME OF MY POWERS.

253
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,791
WATCH THIS.
HEE-YAH!

254
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,500
AHA, LET'S SEE,
WHAT'S THE MOST POPULAR SPOT

255
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,500
FOR ROMANTIC DINING
HERE IN THE CITY?

256
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:50,958
- UH...

257
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,000
- Ryoko: TENCHI!
- Ayeka: TENCHI!

258
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,541
- HUH?
AYEKA?  RYOKO?

259
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,416
- YES, THEY MUSTN'T COME
BETWEEN YOU.

260
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,916
SO... HEE-YAH!

261
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,583
- ( both exclaim )

262
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,625
- THAT'S STRANGE.  I WAS SURE
I HEARD TENCHI'S VOICE

263
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,583
COMING FROM SOMEWHERE
OVER HERE.

264
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,625
- HMM, I HAVE A BAD FEELING
ABOUT ALL THIS.

265
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,125
WE'D BETTER
KEEP LOOKING FOR HIM.

266
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,583
- I THINK
YOU'RE RIGHT.

267
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,333
- ENJOY YOUR TEA,
MY DEARS.

268
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,750
HMM.

269
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,333
- ( gasps )
- HMM.

270
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,416
- ROMANTIC, HUH?

271
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,583
- UH, YEAH.

272
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,541
- WOW.

273
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,916
- ( giggles )

274
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,250
( giggles )

275
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,666
IF I CAN TIE THEM TOGETHER
WITH THE RED STRING OF FATE,

276
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,083
THEN THEY CAN'T HELP
BUT FALL IN LOVE.

277
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,250
IT'S MY STRONGEST
SPELL.

278
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,166
I GUARANTEE THE RESULTS
PERSONALLY.

279
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,416
- WHAT'S UP
DOWN THERE?

280
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,083
- OH, I'M JUST
TIDYING UP, THAT'S ALL.

281
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,583
HOW ABOUT A NICE FILM,
YOU TWO?

282
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,083
- HE COULDN'T HAVE DISAPPEARED
OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH.

283
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,041
- COME ON, TENCHI,
WHERE ARE YOU?

284
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:31,083
- ( Sakuya whimpering )

285
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,416
- Tenchi: HMM.

286
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,958
- ( cackles )

287
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,250
HA!  I JUST LOOP THIS

288
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,166
AROUND THEIR FINGERS
AND MAKE A KNOT.

289
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,083
GOT IT!
- ( Sakuya sneezes )

290
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,750
- OH, I WAS SO CLOSE.

291
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,041
- Sakuya: HUH?

292
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,208
- HOW IS IT COMING ALONG,
MY DEAR?

293
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,208
I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING.
ARE YOU TWO IN LOVE YET?

294
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:22,625
- WELL, I KNOW I'M IN LOVE,
BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT HIM.

295
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:23,625
- HMM.

296
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,041
YES, I CAN SEE
HE'S A HARD CASE,

297
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,666
BUT I STILL HAVE A FEW
TRICKS UP MY SLEEVE.

298
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,625
I'M GONNA START BY TAKING YOU
TO A VERY SPECIAL PLACE.

299
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,833
COME ON,
THERE'S NO TIME TO WASTE.

300
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,791
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

301
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,916
- ( both exclaiming )

302
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,708
- YOU CAN OPEN
YOUR EYES NOW.

303
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,625
- WHERE ARE WE?

304
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,000
- HA-HA!

305
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,166
THIS IS A PLACE
OF LEGENDARY ROMANCE.

306
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,750
IT IS SAID
THAT IF A COUPLE

307
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,833
MAKES A DECLARATION OF LOVE
UNDER THAT TREE,

308
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,833
THEY WILL STAY TOGETHER
FOREVER.

309
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,583
- WOW, I NEVER KNEW SUCH A PLACE
EXISTED AROUND HERE.

310
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,166
COME ON, TENCHI,
LET'S CHECK IT OUT.

311
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,708
- UH, HOLD ON A MINUTE.

312
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,208
- ( laughing )

313
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,208
- MAYBE WE SHOULD SEE
IF IT WORKS.

314
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,041
HOW ABOUT YOU TELLING ME
YOU LOVE ME?

315
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,250
- UH, WELL, I'M NOT--

316
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,041
- WHAT, ARE YOU AFRAID?

317
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,875
- NO.  IT'S JUST
THAT I FEEL

318
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,208
I COULDN'T SAY SOMETHING
LIKE THAT RIGHT NOW.

319
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,833
- ARGH!  YOU MEAN
YOU DON'T THINK

320
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,208
THAT I'M GOOD ENOUGH
FOR YOU?

321
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,875
- YOU MISUNDERSTAND.
I'M NOT SAYING THAT.

322
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,416
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT,
SAKUYA.

323
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,208
WE JUST MET.
IT'S MUCH TOO EARLY

324
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,083
FOR ME TO KNOW
HOW I MIGHT FEEL ABOUT YOU.

325
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,208
- HA-HA!
I'VE DONE IT AGAIN!

326
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,500
I'VE TIED YOU
TOGETHER.

327
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,750
YOU ARE NOW BOUND
BY THE RED THREAD OF FATE.

328
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,000
- ( both exclaim )

329
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,708
- NOW YOU'RE DESTINED
TO BE TOGETHER

330
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,000
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIVES.
THERE'S NO ESCAPE.

331
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,958
- WHA--?
- GREAT.

332
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,708
- IT IS TIME
TO MOVE DOWN THE PATH.

333
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,125
YOU HAVE TO PLACE YOURSELVES
BENEATH THE TREE OF FATE

334
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,916
AND KISS EACH OTHER
PASSIONATELY.

335
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,083
ONCE YOU HAVE DONE THIS,
THE LOVE BETWEEN YOU

336
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,083
SHALL LIVE FOREVER.

337
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,916
- WOW.

338
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,083
OH, BOY.

339
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,333
- WAIT A MINUTE.
CAN'T WE TALK ABOUT THIS?

340
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,666
- NO TIME.
IT'S TOO LATE.

341
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,833
HEE-YAH!

342
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,958
- ( both exclaiming )

343
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,958
- HOLD ON.

344
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,958
HEY, WHAT'S
HAPPENING HERE?

345
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,083
- NO, STOP IT.

346
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:30,583
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.
I'M NOT READY FOR THIS YET.

347
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,125
- THERE'S NO
TURNING BACK, DEAR.

348
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,333
NOW THIS IS WHAT YOU
WANTED, RIGHT?

349
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,583
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL ABOUT LOVERS
EXCHANGING SOME KISSES ANYWAY?

350
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,208
- THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THAT,

351
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,000
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE
FORCED TO DO IT.

352
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,125
- WHO CARES IF YOU'RE FORCED
TO OBEY ME OR NOT?

353
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,791
YOU ALREADY MADE UP YOUR MIND,
SO STOP RESISTING.

354
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,000
OKAY?
( laughs )

355
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,166
- ( gasps )

356
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,875
OH.

357
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,500
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

358
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,333
SAKUYA, FIGHT BACK!
COME ON, WAKE UP.

359
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,958
- IT'S INEVITABLE.  WHY DON'T
YOU GIVE UP, SURRENDER?

360
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,291
SEE?  THIS THREAD
ATTACHED TO YOUR FINGER

361
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,458
HAS DETERMINED YOUR FATE.
IT'S AN UNBREAKABLE CONNECTION

362
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,708
TO THE TRUE LOVE
OF YOUR LIFE.

363
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,791
HUH?

364
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,666
WHERE DID THESE
OTHER STRINGS COME FROM?

365
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,083
- HUH?  HEY!

366
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,291
- WHOA!
- OH!

367
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,833
- ( exclaiming )

368
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,250
- OH, HOW STRANGE.

369
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,750
- MEOW!

370
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,291
- I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MANY
THREADS COMING FROM ONE PERSON.

371
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,250
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO WORK THIS WAY!

372
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,291
- ( screaming )

373
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,208
- SOMEBODY'S GONNA
GET IT.

374
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,041
HEY, TENCHI, WE'VE BEEN
LOOKING ALL OVER.

375
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,208
- WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU?

376
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,583
- SOME REALLY
WEIRD STUFF.

377
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,458
- YOU'RE INTERFERING.
WHO ARE YOU, LADY?

378
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,500
- I WAS ABOUT TO ASK YOU
THE SAME THING.

379
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:55,875
IT LOOKS TO ME
LIKE YOU'VE BEEN

380
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,500
ABDUCTING PEOPLE
AGAINST THEIR WILL.

381
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,333
YOU USED THIS RED THREAD
TO PULL US INTO THIS PLACE.

382
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:03,000
- AND I'M SURE YOU KIDNAPPED
TENCHI IN THE EXACT SAME WAY.

383
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,625
YOU'D BETTER LET US ALL GO
RIGHT NOW.

384
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,583
- OH, REALLY?
I HAPPEN TO BE ON A MISSION,

385
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,958
AND I'M NOT LETTING
ANYBODY GET IN THE WAY.

386
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,958
HA-HA!

387
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,041
- ( both gasp )

388
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,208
- THIS BETTER BE
A PARTY GAME, LADY.

389
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,708
- WELL, I'M HAVING FUN.

390
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,333
- ( screaming )

391
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,291
- ( screaming )

392
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:27,083
- HEY, HAVE A BALL.
YOU'LL STOP IN ABOUT 100 YEARS.

393
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,041
- I'LL STOP SOONER THAN THAT,
AND THEN I'M COMING BACK

394
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,708
TO PUT YOU
OUT OF BUSINESS.

395
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,041
- HA!
- OH!

396
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:35,375
HONESTLY, YOU ARE JUST
THE RUDEST PERSON.

397
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,166
- THEY COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN
LOOSE FROM THAT.

398
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,333
OH!

399
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,791
- ( both screaming )

400
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,750
- ( cackling )

401
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,000
HUH?

402
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,958

407
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,583

408
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,916
- SEND IT ON.

409
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,333
- THIS HAS GOT TO WORK.
IT HAS NEVER, EVER FAILED.

410

- ( screams )

421
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,125
IS THIS ANY WAY TO TREAT
A LOVE GODDESS?

422
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,083
OH, WHAT A WORLD.

423

- ( chuckling )

424
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,208

ARE YOU OKAY?

425
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,875
OPEN YOUR EYES.

426
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,625
- ( grunting )

427
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,166
WHERE ARE WE?

428
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,083
WHERE'S THE LOVE KNOT
GODDESS?

429
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,666
- WHAT?  I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

430
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,666
YOU NODDED OFF
AND HAD A PRETTY BAD DREAM.

431
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,875
- I DID?
IT SEEMED SO REAL.

432
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,416
- IT WAS PROBABLY
SOMETHING YOU ATE.

433
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,000
- I'M DESTINED
TO BE WITH TENCHI.

434
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,791
I WAS RIGHT,
AND THIS CONFIRMED IT.

435
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,458
- NOW I'M MORE SURE
THAN EVER

436
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,166
THAT TENCHI AND I
ARE MEANT TO BE TOGETHER.

437
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,750
THE THREAD OF FATE
CONNECTED US.

TENCHI.

- SEE YOU AT SCHOOL TOMORROW.
- HUH?

- SHE WANTS TO BE
HIS GIRLFRIEND.

00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,958
MARK MY WORDS,
SHE'S A CONNIVER.

444
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:36,583
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH HER.

445
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:40,291
YES, WE'LL BE WATCHING YOU,

MEOW.

449
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:10,375
MEOW.

450

- Ayeka: PLEASE ALLOW ME
TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,083
I'M AYEKA.

MISS RYOKO'S
SELFISH BEHAVIOR

453
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,250
UPSET LORD TENCHI
SO MUCH

454
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,833
THAT HE TOLD US ALL
NEVER TO COME TO TOKYO.

455
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:27,291
NOW OUR ONLY HOPE
IS THE MONITORING DEVICE

456
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:29,375
MISS WASHU HAS INVENTED
FOR US,

457
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:32,208
SO THAT WE CAN AT LEAST
SEE HIM ON THE MONITOR'S SCREEN.

458
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:35,041
I KNOW IT'S SNEAKY,
BUT I MISS HIM.
