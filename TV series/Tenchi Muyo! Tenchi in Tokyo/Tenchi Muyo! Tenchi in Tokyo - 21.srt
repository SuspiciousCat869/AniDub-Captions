1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,041
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,541
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:20,041
- ( moaning slightly )

4
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,666
- SASAMI.

5
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,541
SASAMI!

6
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,875
- ( gasps )

7
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,083
IS THAT YOU, YUGI?

8
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,833
- YES.

9
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,708
WE'RE FRIENDS,
AREN'T WE, SASAMI?

10
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,375
- HUH?

11
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,208
( giggles )
SURE, YOU BET.

12
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,500
- HMM.

13
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,250
- ( gasps )

14
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,250
YUGI YUGI!

15
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,958
WHERE ARE YOU?!

16
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,583
( gasps ) YUGI!
- ( screeches )

17
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,541
- HUH HUH?

18
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,291
OH...

19
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,083
I WAS DREAMING
ABOUT YUGI AGAIN.

20
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,541
- ( meows )

21
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,500
- ( people talking,
laughing on TV )

22
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,041
- ( sighs ) NORMALLY THIS
IS MY FAVORITE FOOD.

23
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:35,416
NOODLES USUALLY HIT THE SPOT
IN THE SUMMERTIME.

24
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,291
BUT TODAY THEY JUST TASTE
KINDA BLAH.

25
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,500
- Man on TV: GET OUT OF HERE,
AND PACK YOUR BAGS, BUD.

26
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,208
- Man on TV #2:
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

27
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,208
THE ONLY BAGS I OWN
ARE UNDER MY EYES!

28
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,416
- ( knocking )
- HUH?

29
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,250
- Man on TV:
WELL, WHEN I'M DONE WITH YOU...

30
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,416
- WASHU?

31
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,250
- OH.  ( chuckles )

32
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,833
- WHAT?
NOW YOU COME OUT?

33
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,291
- LONG TIME NO SEE.
DID YOU MISS ME, PRINCESS?

34
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,625
- WHILE YOU'VE BEEN
LOCKED UP IN THERE...

35
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,500
...TERRIBLE THINGS HAVE BEEN
HAPPENING OUT HERE!

36
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,083
RYOKO'S GONE BACK
TO OUTER SPACE

37
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,583
TO LIVE THE LIFE OF
A SPACE PIRATE AGAIN!

38
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,750
WHAT'S WORSE IS MIHOSHI
AND KIYONE ARE IN SPACE TOO.

39
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:09,375
- AAH!
- AND TENCHI IS STILL IN TOKYO!

40
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,625
- I'VE GOT STUFF TO SHOW YOU.

41
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,750
- HUH?

42
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,416
- I'VE MADE SOME
IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES.

43
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,166
- ( laughing,
playful screaming )

44
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,833
- I GOT IT, I GOT IT!
- GET IT!

45
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,708
- HOT DOGS, NACHOS AND CHEESE.

46
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,708
- TIME FOR US
TO CATCH SOME RAYS.

47
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:29,958
- ( laughing )

48
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,791
- PASS IT OVER TO ME.

49
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,625
- AAH!

50
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,625
- TENCHI, WHAT ARE YOU
STARING AT?

51
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,500
- COME ON, I'M WATCHING
THE SCENERY.

52
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,833
- ( grunts )

53
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,333
- SORRY, BOYS, IT SLIPPED.

54
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,166
HEY, TENCHI, WHY DON'T YOU
COME AND JOIN US?

55
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,250
- EH...

56
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,458
- WELL?

57
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,708
( giggles )

58
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,666
- ( beeping )

59
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,625
- JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

60
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,625
- I REMEMBER THAT GIRL.

61
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,958
- YES, WE BOTH DO.
THIS IS THAT AWFUL GIRL

62
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,416
NAMED YUGI WHO ATTACKED
THE MASAKI SHRINE.

63
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,666
- ( beeping rapidly )

64
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,208
- NOW DID YOU CATCH THAT?

65
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,375
- ( giggles bashfully )
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO SEE?

66
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:23,916
- HER ORGANIC ENERGY
HAD A TRACE OF JURAITRIUM 7000.

67
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,875
- WHAT IS THIS JURAI-TRIO STUFF?

68
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:30,875
HUH?

69
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,541
WOW.
OH, MY GOODNESS.

70
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,208
- JURAITRIUM 7000
IS THE ORGANIC ENERGY

71
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,625
POSSESSED BY ONLY JURAIANS.

72
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,416
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. YOU'RE
SAYING YUGI IS A JURAIAN

73
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
JUST LIKE MYSELF?

74
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,083
- IT SURE LOOKS THAT WAY.

75
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,750
- BUT THAT CAN'T BE POSSIBLE.

76
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,416
HOW WOULD OTHER JURAIANS
BESIDES US HAVE GOTTEN HERE?

77
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,000
- THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW.

78
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,666
- NOBODY ON OUR PLANET IS
EVEN REMOTELY LIKE HER

79
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,791
IN ANY WAY. IF SHE'S HERE NOW,
HOW DID SHE COME TO EARTH?

80
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,041
- I HAVE AN IDEA.

81
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,541
DO YOU REMEMBER THOSE
OLD ROOMS IN OKUTAMA?

82
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,916
- ( gasps )

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,875
SURE DO.

84
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,250
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
ASIDE FROM US,

85
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,916
THAT'S THE ONLY JURAIAN WE KNOW
WHO'S EVER BEEN TO EARTH.

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
- I NEED YOU TO GO BACK
TO THE RUINS AND CHECK OUT

87
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,458
SOMETHING FOR ME WHILE I
CONTINUE MY RESEARCH HERE.

88
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,708
- I'LL GET RIGHT ON IT.

89
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:20,333
THE SOONER WE FIND OUT
ABOUT HER, THE BETTER.

90
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,916
- ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE
ALL RIGHT THERE, PRINCESS?

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,916
- SURELY THERE'S AN EASIER WAY
FOR YOU TO TRAVEL.

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,375
- THIS MISSION IS URGENT.

93
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,708
I CAN'T BE TOO CHOOSY
ABOUT THE WAY I GET THERE.

94
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,875
IT'S SO HARD TO BELIEVE
THAT YUGI'S FROM MY PLANET.

95
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,041
- PRINCESS, YOU'RE LOOKING
QUITE PALE.

96
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,666
WOULD YOU LIKE TO REST
A WHILE?

97
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,541
- I'M ALL RIGHT.
IT'S JUST THAT--

98
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:40,875
- WHAT?

99
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,500
- I'M HAVING A HARD TIME
WITH THE FACT

100
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:45,166
THAT THERE MAY BE SOMEONE ELSE
ON EARTH FROM JURAI.

101
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,000
AND I'M PUZZLED AS TO
WHY SHE WOULD WANT

102
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,666
TO ATTACK THE MASAKI SHRINE.

103
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,166
- THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION.

104
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,625
- WE DON'T HAVE A CLUE EITHER.

105
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,750
- THIS YUGI...
WHO IS SHE, REALLY?

106
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,291
- ( straining )

107
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:04,125
( laughs ) THIS IS TRULY THE
BEST WAY TO CHILL WATERMELONS.

108
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,291
DON'T YOU THINK?
- ( meows )

109
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,166
- GEE, BEFORE EVERYBODY
WENT AWAY,

110
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,041
A WATERMELON THIS SIZE
WOULDN'T HAVE LASTED LONG.

111
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,583
WANNA GO HOME NOW?

112
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:24,708
- ( meows sadly )

113
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,125
- ( both gasp )

114
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,583
- ( whimpers )

115
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,333
- OH...

116
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,458
- Both: HUH?
- OH!

117
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,458
- ( giggles )

118
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:54,791
- OH, WOW, YUGI!

119
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,791
- I'VE COME TO VISIT YOU.

120
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:58,750
I'VE MISSED YOU.

121
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,708
- CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU BOTH DONE A GREAT JOB.

122
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,750
- THANK YOU, SIR.
I FEEL QUITE HONORED.

123
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,666
- I FEEL HONORED ALSO.

124
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,541
- THANKS TO YOUR HARD WORK,
WE WERE ABLE TO DISCOVER

125
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,708
AND DESTROY THE HIDEOUT OF THAT
TERRIBLE SPACE PIRATE, RYOKO,

126
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,708
AND ARREST MOST
OF HER HENCHMEN AS WELL.

127
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:21,083
- WOW!  FOR DOING ALL THAT,
 YOU SHOULD BE THANKING US.

128
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,708
( chuckles )
- HMM...

129
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,250
- OH!
- ( laughter )

130
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,958
- KIYONE!

131
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,541
- OH, I'M GONNA GET YOU
FOR THAT.

132
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,583
- NO WAY!
- ( laughter )

133
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,541
- ( overlapping chatter )

134
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,791
- THIS IS WHY I WENT BACK
TO BEING A SPACE PIRATE--

135
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,666
SO I COULD DISRUPT THE WORLD
THAT NASTY BACKSTABBERS,

136
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,541
LIKE THE BOTH OF YOU,
WALK AROUND IN.

137
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,875
- WAIT, DON'T LEAVE!
WHAT ABOUT TENCHI?

138
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,541
IS THIS WHAT YOU REALLY WANT?

139
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:48,916
YOU'RE NEVER GOING
BACK TO EARTH?

140
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,958
- THAT'S HISTORY.

141
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,291
- WHAT'S HAPPENED TO US?

142
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,458
HOW DID WE BECOME
SUCH TERRIBLE ENEMIES?

143
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,750
- WE'D LIKE TO REWARD
 YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENT.

144
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:56,791
- ( gasps slightly )
- AND ON THAT NOTE,

145
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,416
WE AT GALAXY POLICE HEADQUARTERS

146
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,750
ARE PREPARED TO OFFER YOU
THE POSITION YOU DESERVE--

147
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,750
CONTINGENT UPON
RYOKO'S ARREST, OF COURSE.

148
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,250
- WOW!  WHAT COULD THAT BE?

149
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:08,166
- REASSIGNMENT BACK
TO GALAXY HEADQUARTERS.

150
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,833
- Both:
WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL, SIR.

151
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,916
- GOSH, I'M NOT SURE
WHAT WE DID,

152
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,916
BUT I'LL BET YOU'RE THRILLED.
AM I RIGHT?

153
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,500
- UH...
- KIYONE?

154
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:27,333
- MIHOSHI AND KIYONE PLAYED
SUCH A DIRTY TRICK ON ME.

155
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:30,416
BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT,
THEY CRACK ME UP.

156
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,083
IT WAS A HOOT
GETTING THE BEST OF THEM

157
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,750
BEFORE THEY FIGURED OUT
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

158
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,375
- ( inaudible )

159
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,958
- IT WAS A LOT OF FUN
HANGING OUT WITH THEM AGAIN.

160
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,791
- WHAT'S UP?

161
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,833
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE IN A GOOD MOOD.

162
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,125
- AS MATTER OF FACT,
I AM.

163
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,500
YOU KNOW WHAT?

164
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,416
I'M THINKING I SHOULD GO
VISIT EARTH ONCE IN A WHILE.

165
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,541
- HMM, YOU COULD.

166
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,791
BUT WHY WOULD WANT
TO GO BACK THERE?

167
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,500
UNLESS YOU'RE MISSING SOMEONE
THAT YOU MUST GO SEE.

168
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,625
- WHO'S THERE TO MISS, HUH?

169
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,708
( growls )

170
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,333
I'M NEVER GOING
TO GO BACK THERE!

171
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,708
WHY SHOULD I?
I'M RYOKO THE SPACE PIRATE.

172
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:06,375
I DON'T BELONG THERE.
IT'S THE BOONDOCKS!

173
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,375
- YOU ARE SO RIGHT.

174
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,375
( chuckles )

175
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,875
- ( giggling )

176
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:20,041
COME ON. JUMP IN, YUGI!
THE WATER'S GREAT.

177
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,500
- OKAY...

178
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,666
( gasps )

179
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,166
-  YOU ALL RIGHT?

180
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,000
- HMM.  IF I THAW OUT.

181
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,000
- ( laughs )

182
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,416
- ( shrieks )

183
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,291
- YOU KNOW, I JUST HAD
A DREAM ABOUT YOU.

184
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,208
AND THEN HERE YOU ARE--
YOU SHOW UP IN REAL LIFE.

185
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,375
IT'S SOME COINCIDENCE, HUH?

186
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,000
- YEAH.

187
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,500
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

188
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,083
I LOVE THE FOREST.

189
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:50,750
- ME TOO.
IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLACES.

190
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,083
IT REMINDS ME OF HOME,
PLANET JURAI.

191
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:56,958
- PLANET JURAI. I'D LIKE TO
LIVE IN A PLACE LIKE THIS.

192
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,416
WITH YOU, SASAMI.
- WHAT?

193
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,875
- WE'RE FRIENDS, AREN'T WE?

194
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,875
WE SHOULD BE TOGETHER FOREVER.

195
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:03,833
- HUH?

196
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,583
YUGI...

197
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,166
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

198
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,500
- ( meows )

199
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,083
- ( steady beeping )

200
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,791
- THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

201
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:37,208
THE ENERGY FLOW FROM JURAI TREE
HAS BEEN COMPLETELY CUT OFF.

202
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,416
- AND THAT'S WHY
IT BECAME UNSEALED.

203
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,083
- AZAKA, IS IT POSSIBLE
TO COLLECT ANY DATA

204
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,750
FROM THE CAPSULE'S
MEMORY BANKS?

205
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,916
- WE COULD TRY TO ACTIVATE THEM
WITH OUR OWN ENERGY.

206
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,666
- THEN TRY IT.
- Both: YES, MA'AM.

207
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,125
- WE ARE RECEIVING
SOME DATA NOW.

208
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,875
DATA HAS BEEN ASSIMILATED.

209
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,791
- LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT WHAT WE GOT.

210
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,791
- IN THE 27TH YEAR OF
THE EMPRESS HINASE'S

211
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:22,916
REIGN OVER JURAI,

212
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,916
HORRIBLE EVIL POWERS
WERE AWAKENED

213
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,416
IN A SIX-YEAR-OLD MUTANT
AND UNLEASHED ON THE PLANET.

214
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,625
- IN THE 27TH YEAR
OF HINASE?

215
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,291
- ACCORDING TO INFORMATION
STORED IN MY DATA BANK,

216
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,583
THAT WAS THE SAME YEAR
THAT PLANET JURAI

217
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,083
WAS ALMOST ANNIHILATED.

218
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,583
- SO THE MUTANT WHO CAUSE D IT
ALL WAS SEALED UP IN HERE

219
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,375
TO PREVENT FURTHER DESTRUCTION?

220
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,000
- ( gasps )

221
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,500
- AWW.

222
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:50,500
( giggles )

223
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,541
- ( humming )

224
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,208
- ( birds chirping )

225
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,000
- OH...

226
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,375
- ( chuckles )
YOU KNOW WHAT, YUGI?

227
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,125
- WHAT?
- EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK

228
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,666
YOU CAN FIND LOTS OF FRIENDS.

229
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,291
- YAH!

230
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:08,208
- HMM, BUT REAL ONES?

231
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,208
- HUH?

232
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,875
- I HAVE BEEN
ALL ALONE FOR A LONG TIME.

233
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,125
I WAS SO LONELY
THAT I CREATED MY OWN FRIENDS.

234
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:27,083
- ( growls )

235
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,916
- ( screaming )

236
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,583
- COME ON, EVERYONE,
PLAYTIME!

237
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,583
- ( growling )

238
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,625
- ( laughing )

239
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,458
- USING HER
EXTRAORDINARY POWER,

240
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:53,458
THE MUTANT CAUSED GREAT CHAOS
THROUGHOUT THE PLANET OF JURAI.

241
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:58,083
NO SINGLE WARRIOR HAD STOPPED
HER DESTABILIZING FORCE.

242
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,375
- ( laughing )

243
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,875
( grunts )

244
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:03,916
( gasps )

245
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:10,625
OH...

246
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,375
STOP RIGHT NOW!

247
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,791
PLEASE DON'T KILL THEM!
STOP FIRING!

248
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:32,250
- EMPRESS HINASE EMPLOYED
HER OWN COLOSSAL POWER,

249
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:37,000
WHICH WAS FINALLY ABLE
TO MATCH THE MUTANT'S STRENGTH.

250
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,583
- I WAS JUST KIDDING AROUND!

251
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:39,916
PLEASE STOP IT RIGHT NOW!

252
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,958
AAH!

253
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,666
( screams )

254
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,208
AAH!
NO, WAIT!

255
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:57,666
( screams )

256
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,125
- FAIR AND NOBLE SPIRIT,

257
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:04,625
EMPOWER ME SO THAT I AM ABLE
TO PUT THIS EVIL ONE

258
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:05,958
INTO ETERNAL SLEEP.

259
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,041
- ( screaming )

260
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,208
LET ME GO!

261
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,375
AAH!

262
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,333
PLEASE DON'T!
I'M AFRAID OF THE DARK!

263
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,833
DON'T SHUT ME IN!

264
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,041
PLEASE STOP IT!

265
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,833
I'M SO SCARED.
DON'T LEAVE ME ALONE!

266
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:35,250
I DON'T WANNA BE ALONE!

267
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,875
- ( echoing ) 
- ( rumbling )

268
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,333
- POOR LITTLE CHILD.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

269
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:49,375
HOWEVER, YOUR POWER POSES
A GREAT DANGER TO US ALL.

270
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,791
I'M SO SORRY TO HAVE
TO DO THIS TO YOU...

271
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,291
BUT I DON'T HAVE 
ANY OTHER CHOICE.

272
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,500
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

273
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,666
- EMPRESS HINASE
SEALED UP THE MUTANT.

274
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,041
AND TO BE CERTAIN THAT
THIS POWERFUL CHILD

275
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,666
WOULD NEVER AGAIN AWAKEN

276
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,833
AND THREATEN THE STABILITY
OF JURAI,

277
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:11,041
SHE EXILED HER
TO A REMOTE PART OF SPACE,

278
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,708
WHERE FEW PLANETS EXISTED.

279
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,833
- THE OUTER REACHES OF
SPACE MAY HAVE BEEN HER

280
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,708
ORIGINAL DESTINATION, BUT
SHE NEVER ARRIVED.

281
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,375
THE REALITY IS SHE FELL DOWN
TO EARTH SOMEHOW.

282
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,708
- ISN'T THAT A STRANGE
TWIST OF FATE?

283
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,583
- I'LL BET NOBODY EVER DREAMED
THAT 3500 YEARS LATER

284
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,208
WE WOULD ALL END UP
ON THE SAME PLANET.

285
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,625
AND THAT I WOULD BE
STANDING ON THE SPOT

286
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,583
WHERE THE SHRINE FELL.

287
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,791
- AAH.

288
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,291
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?
- ( gasps )

289
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,458
- WHY DO YOU LOOK SO SAD, YUGI?

290
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,500
DID SOMETHING BAD
HAPPEN TO YOU, HUH?

291
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,625
- ( meows )

292
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,250
- IT MUST BE WRONG

293
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,083
TO CREATE YOUR OWN PLAYMATES.

294
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,083
- WHAT?

295
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,416
- BECAUSE WHEN I DID,

296
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,000
I WAS SEVERELY PUNISHED!

297
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,458
- ( gasps )

298
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,625
- MM...

299
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,416
- COME ON, CHEER UP!
NOW QUIT WORRYING.

300
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,583
NOBODY WILL EVER
BOTHER YOU HERE, YUGI.

301
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:11,583
- MEOW MEOW MEOW!

302
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,708
- YEAH, OKAY.

303
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,166
- YOU'VE CONFIRMED IT.

304
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,166
YUGI IS THE MUTANT
WHO WAS SEALED UP IN A CAPSULE

305
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,250
FOR MANY THOUSANDS
OF YEARS.

306
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,750
NOW WE FINALLY KNOW
WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE.

307
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,916
- BUT WHAT WE DON'T KNOW
IS WHY DID SHE ATTACK

308
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,125
THE MASAKI SHRINE.

309
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,916
WAS IT AN ACT OF REVENGE
AGAINST US JURAIANS?

310
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,791
- I DOUBT THAT'S
THE WHOLE STORY.

311
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,208
IT'S INTERESTING, THOUGH,

312
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,500
THAT YUGI AWOKE
FROM HER LONG SLEEP

313
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,625
ABOUT THE SAME TIME
AS TENCHI'S FAMILY

314
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:40,458
STARTED FALLING APART.

315
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:41,958
- UH-HUH.

316
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:45,458
- IT SEEMS HIGHLY UNLIKELY
THAT THIS IS SHEER COINCIDENCE.

317
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,541
- ( laughing )
LET'S GO TO THIS PLACE.

318
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,291
THEY HAVE
THE MOST AWESOME RIDE.

319
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,791
- UM, I'M A LITTLE AFRAID
OF THAT.

320
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,458
- GOSH, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE SUCH A SCAREDY-CAT.

321
00:17:58,541 --> 00:17:59,708
HOW ABOUT THIS THEN?

322
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,333
- HMM...

323
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:04,041
THE PARASITE MUSEUM.

324
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,125
- Both: HUH?

325
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,208
HUH?

326
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,708
- WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT WAS?

327
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,000
- I BETTER SEE.

328
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,708
AAH!  WASHU, IT'S YOU!

329
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,375
- YEP.
WHEN I FIXED THE TUNNEL,

330
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,541
THE EXIT COORDINATES GOT
ALL SCREWED UP.

331
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,791
( straining )
OOH!

332
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,791
- I KNOW HER. HOW COME SHE
ENDED UP IN YOUR TOILET?

333
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,125
- THERE'S NO TIME TO EXPLAIN.
TENCHI, I NEED YOU

334
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,791
TO COME BACK TO
OKAYAMA WITH ME.

335
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,083
- WHAT?
- HUH?

336
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,666
- THERE'S SOMETHING
VERY VERY FISHY GOING ON.

337
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,500
- AYEKA ALREADY
TOLD ME ABOUT THAT.

338
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,833
YOU'RE ALL GETTING
SCATTERED AROUND, RIGHT?

339
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,416
- AND IT HAPPENED
VERY QUICKLY.

340
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
TENCHI, AREN'T YOU CONCERNED?

341
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,250
- I THINK YOU'RE BOTH
OVERREACTING.

342
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,666
IT'S A MERE COINCIDENCE.

343
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,833
- AH-AH-AH.
WAS IT MERE COINCIDENCE

344
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,875
THAT SOMEBODY ATTACKED
THE MASAKI SHRINE?

345
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,208
- WHAT?!  WHO WOULD HAVE DONE
SUCH A THING, AND WHY?!

346
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,500
- LOOK, I'M AFRAID THAT'S
A VERY LONG STORY.

347
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,333
- ARE GRANDPA
AND THE OTHERS OKAY?

348
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,791
- THEY BARELY SURVIVED.

349
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,083
I THINK IT WAS MEANT ONLY
AS A NASTY THREAT.

350
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,000
- I'M GRATEFUL
EVERYONE'S ALL RIGHT.

351
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,166
- BUT WITHOUT A DOUBT,

352
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,083
SOMETHING IS HAPPENING
IN YOUR HOMETOWN.

353
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,958
SOMETHING TERRIBLE, I THINK.

354
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,666
WILL YOU COME BACK WITH ME?

355
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,916
- YEAH, OF COURSE.
- TENCHI.

356
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,125
- HUH?

357
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,750
- WAIT! I THOUGHT WE
TALKED ABOUT SPENDING

358
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,166
THE SUMMER TOGETHER.
YOU PROMISED

359
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:17,916
WE WOULDN'T LEAVE
EACH OTHER'S SIDE

360
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,916
THE WHOLE TIME!

361
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,750
- SORRY, BUT I HAVE TO GO.

362
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,875
WASHU, JUST LET ME
GET MY STUFF.

363
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:23,875
- ( gasps slightly )

364
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,708
( exhales )

365
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,375
OH!
- STOP IT!

366
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,541
- DON'T GO.
STAY WITH ME, TENCHI, PLEASE.

367
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,416
WE WERE MAKING
SO MANY PLANS.

368
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,958
- SAKUYA, I FEEL AWFUL--

369
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,458
- EVERYBODY SEEMS TO
BE MORE IMPORTANT

370
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:35,708
TO YOU THAN I AM!

371
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,458
- STOP! I'M NOT SAYING THAT.

372
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:38,916
BECAUSE IT'S NOT
LIKE THAT AT ALL.

373
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,875
- TENCHI, THANK GOODNESS
YOU'RE HERE!

374
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,541
MY GRANDFATHER'S BEEN HURT.

375
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,916
- WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?
WILL HE BE ALL RIGHT?

376
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,416
- HE HURT HIS HIP
WHEN WE FELL OFF HIS MOPED,

377
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,208
AND NOW HE CAN'T STAND UP.

378
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,541
AND THE PROBLEM IS THERE'S
A TRAFFIC SAFETY CEREMONY

379
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:52,875
THIS AFTERNOON.

380
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,791
HE'S SUPPOSED TO HOST IT.
CAN YOU COVER FOR HIM?

381
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,208
- WHAT?!  HOW CAN I PRETEND
TO BE HIM?

382
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,333
- YOU JUST ACT LIKE
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

383
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,250
AND EVERYTHING WILL
BE FINE. I CAN'T TELL THEM THAT

384
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,041
GRANDPA WON'T BE AT THE
TRAFFIC SAFETY FUNCTION

385
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,166
BECAUSE HE WAS IN A
TRAFFIC ACCIDENT.

386
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,458
- ( groaning )

387
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,583
I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T GO
WITH YOU.

388
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,041
MAYBE I'LL BE ABLE
TO CATCH UP WITH YOU SOON.

389
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,708
- YOU GOTTA DO
WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

390
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,250
- COME ON, TENCHI!
HURRY!

391
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,041
- HANG ON.
LET ME GRAB MY JACKET.

392
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,416
- ( door closes )
- OH, WELL, IT'S PROBABLY

393
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,875
NOT CRITICAL FOR TENCHI

394
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:20,333
TO BE IN OKAYAMA RIGHT NOW.
IT WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

395
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,125
BESIDES, IT'LL BE A
WHILE UNTIL I FINISH

396
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,291
MY DATA ANALYSIS ANYWAY.

397
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,750
TIME TO GO.
GOTTA GET BACK TO WORK.

398
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:27,708
HUH?

399
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,041
HMM...

400
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,791
- IT'S GOTTEN VERY QUIET,
SASAMI.

401
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,083
- THAT'S BECAUSE
IT'S EVENING ALREADY.

402
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,041
EVERYONE'S PROBABLY GONE HOME.

403
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,958
- SASAMI?
- YEAH?

404
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,291
- YOU SHOULD MOVE TO MY PLACE.
 WE COULD LIVE THERE TOGETHER.

405
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,541
- WHAT?

406
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,375
- THEY'RE ALL GONNA BE
GONE PRETTY SOON ANYWAY.

407
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,875
SO COME WITH ME.

408
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,583
WE'LL HAVE A WONDERFUL LIFE
TOGETHER.

409
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,958
IT'LL BE THE MOST PERFECT
FRIENDSHIP!

410
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,000
I JUST CAN'T WAIT.

411
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,708
- I'M SORRY,
BUT THAT'S A CRAZY IDEA.

412
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:05,750
- HUH?

413
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,291
- WE CAN'T POSSIBLY
LIVE ON OUR OWN.

414
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,416
AFTER ALL,
WE'RE STILL JUST CHILDREN.

415
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,916
- DON'T YOU DISAPPOINT ME!

416
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,250
- HUH?
AAH!

417
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,500
AAH!

418
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,958
- ( growling )

419
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,125
- YUGI...

420
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,750
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO YOU?

421
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,375
YUGI.

422
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,958
- ( upbeat music playing )

423
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,125
- ( people singing in Japanese )

424
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:05,250
- YAH!
( growls )

425
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:07,208
( meows )

426
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,708
- Tenchi: SAKUYA, YOU'RE
INTO PHOTOGRAPHY NOW?

427
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:19,083
THAT'S A VINTAGE CAMERA
YOU HAVE THERE, ISN'T IT?

428
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,458
WELL, YOU'VE GOTTA BE CAREFUL
WITH THOSE OLD CAMERAS.

429
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:24,500
YOU LOOK THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER
AND PRESS THE SHUTTER AND BOOM--

430
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:27,625
THE PERSON PHOTOGRAPHED
LOSES HIS SOUL, THEY SAY.

431
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:30,458
WHAT?  WHERE DID I GET
THIS SILLY OLD JOKE?

432
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:33,291
WELL, IT WAS MY GRANDPA
WHO TOLD ME THAT.

433
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:36,250
THE NEXT EPISODE OF
THE NEW TENCHI MUYO SERIES...
