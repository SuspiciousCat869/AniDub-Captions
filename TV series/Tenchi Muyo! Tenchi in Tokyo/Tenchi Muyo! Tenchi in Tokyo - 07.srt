1
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:35,041
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:45,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,416
- ( meowing )

4
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:11,666
( screeching )
- TENCHI!

5
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,250
TENCHI, TENCHI!

6
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:17,833
COME BACK HOME, TENCHI!

7
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,708
TENCHI!

8
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,750
COME BACK!

9
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,666
- Girl: I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE GOING HOME TODAY.

10
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,041
IS ANYTHING WRONG
AT HOME, TENCHI?

11
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,666
- WELL, NO, I MEAN,
THAT IS NOTHING SERIOUS.

12
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,541
- HEY, I KNOW.
WHAT IF I GO BACK WITH YOU?

13
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,000
- WHAT?
- I WANNA SEE WHERE YOU GREW UP.

14
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,875
AND I'D LIKE TO MEET
YOUR MOTHER AND FATHER.

15
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,791
I'D BET THEY'D BE SURPRISED
IF YOU CAME HOME

16
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,541
WITH A FRIEND LIKE ME, HUH?
- SURPRISED?  YEAH, RIGHT.

17
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:51,875
THAT WON'T WORK OUT.

18
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,875
- WELL, IT WOULD BE KIND
OF SHORT NOTICE.

19
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,750
MAYBE I CAN MEET THEM
ANOTHER TIME, HUH?

20
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,666
- YEAH.  ( laughs )

21
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,708
- HERE.  TAKE THIS.
YOU CAN EAT IT ON THE TRAIN.

22
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,416
I MADE IT MYSELF
JUST FOR YOUR TRIP.

23
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,458
- OH, THANK YOU.

24
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:07,333
- NOW YOU HAVE A GREAT TRIP,
TENCHI.

25
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,541
- YEAH, THAT'S IT.
MAKE IT NICE AND PRETTY, AYEKA.

26
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,250
- IT JUST NEEDS
ANOTHER FLOWER.  OW!

27
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,500
- AYEKA!
- ( laughing )

28
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,083
- WOW!
THAT'S QUITE A SCAM.

29
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,625
- THIS IS OUR PART-TIME JOB.
- YEAH, BUT IT'S SO MUCH

30
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,291
MORE FUN WHEN WE DON'T HAVE TO
DO IT FOR MONEY.

31
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,166
- YES, THAT'S TRUE.
- WHEN WE DO IT FOR MONEY,

32
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,250
WE HAVE TO MAKE ZILLIONS
OF THESE FLOWERS.

33
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,708
- WHOOPS, SORRY.

34
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,083
- ( screaming )

35
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,250
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP THERE?
YOU ALMOST HIT US.

36
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,583
- SORRY.  I'M TRYING
TO FIX THIS THING.

37
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,458
IT LOOKS LIKE THE DIMENSION
TUNNEL'S GONNA BE OUT

38
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:14,833
OF COMMISSION
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

39
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,625
- THIS IS KIND OF WEIRD.
WHAT IS IT, MISS WASHU?

40
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:21,666
- DON'T TOUCH THAT.  WAIT!
- ( screaming )

41
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,583
- KIYONE, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

42
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,291
- DOES IT LOOK LIKE
I'M ALL RIGHT?

43
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,541
- NOW DON'T GET ANGRY.
THIS IS A SPECIAL DAY.

44
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,458
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE CELEBRATING, REMEMBER?

45
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,583
( laughs )
- HUH?

46
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,833
OH.  THAT'S RIGHT.

47
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:43,500
IT IS A SPECIAL DAY. 
THE DAY WE GOT THESE.

48
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,250
- I REMEMBER.

49
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,041
- IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS

50
00:04:57,125 --> 00:05:00,166
ALL SO VERY, VERY LONG AGO.

51
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,083
TENCHI'S ANNIVERSARY.

52
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,291
WHOOPS!

53
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,083
I CAN PICTURE IT ALL PERFECTLY.

54
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:21,375
THE SKY WAS EXACTLY LIKE THIS
ON THAT DAY.

55
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,541
IF AYEKA HADN'T CHASED ME
TO THE EARTH,

56
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,750
I WOULD NEVER
HAVE MET TENCHI.

57
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,666
- OUR BLASTER MADE A DIRECT HIT

58
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,125
ON THEIR PROTECTIVE SHIELD.

59
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:51,000
- THE SHIELD'S REFLECTION
RATIO IS 88%.

60
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,333
OUR BLASTS HAVE
NOT PENETRATED.

61
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,083
- JUST KEEP SHOOTING.
WE'VE GOT TO GET THROUGH.

62
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:59,208
RYOKO, THAT SPACE PIRATE.
SHE HAD THE NERVE

63
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,041
TO STEAL THE JURAI LIGHTSTONE.

64
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:03,875
- AYEKA, HEY,
LISTEN TO WHAT I'M SAYING.

65
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,416
DON'T YOU THINK THAT WE
SHOULD LET THE GALAXY POLICE

66
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,666
HANDLE THIS STUFF?
- SASAMI, ARE YOU CRAZY?

67
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,791
THE LIGHTSTONE IS ONE OF
THE MOST CHERISHED TREASURES

68
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,000
OF OUR JURAI ROYAL FAMILY.

69
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,916
AND THE GALAXY POLICE
ARE INCOMPETENT BUNGLERS

70
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,250
WHO TRIED TO CATCH
RYOKO A THOUSAND TIMES

71
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,958
AND SHE ALWAYS MAKES
THEM LOOK LIKE COMPLETE IDIOTS.

72
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,250
- UH, EXCUSE ME.

73
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,916
WE CAN HEAR EVERYTHING
YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT US.

74
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
- YOUR HIGHNESS, PRINCESS AYEKA,
THE CHIEF OF POLICE

75
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:30,000
HAS ASKED THAT YOU WOULD PLEASE
LEAVE THIS MATTER TO US.

76
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,375
- IDENTIFY YOURSELVES.

77
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:35,583
I'M GALAXY POLICE
DETECTIVE FIRST CLASS KIYONE.

78
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,625
- MIHOSHI, AT YOUR SERVICE.
- DON'T LET ME STOP YOU.

79
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,500
YOU TWO JUST GO RIGHT AHEAD
AND YOU TRY TO CATCH RYOKO.

80
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,458
- both: YES, MA'AM.

81
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,250
- YEAH, WE DID IT.
- HMM?

82
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,625
- IF WE ARREST THAT
SPACE PIRATE RYOKO,

83
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,958
WE'LL GET A BIG RAISE
AND A PROMOTION.

84
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,500
NOT TO MENTION
WE'LL GET OUR POSITIONS BACK

85
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:56,500
AT HEADQUARTERS.
THIS IS OUR BIG CHANCE, PARTNER.

86
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,625
MIHOSHI, TRY NOT
TO BE YOUR USUAL

87
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,791
AIRHEAD SELF TODAY, PLEASE.
- YOU CAN COUNT ON ME.

88
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,916
ATTENTION OUT THERE,
THIS IS THE GALAXY POLICE.

89
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,166
SEE THAT BIG RED STATION THINGY,
STOP AND PULL OVER!

90
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,500
WHAT IS THAT?
- IT'S A GIGANTIC LASER CANNON!

91
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,541
- TAKE EVASIVE ACTION!

92
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:19,791
- ( screaming )

93
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,500
- RYO OHKI!

94
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,666
- HOW DARE YOU,
YOU SPACE PIRATE.

95
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,958
I'LL SHOW YOU THE TRUE POWER

96
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,416
OF MY NEW EXTREME
BATTLE STATION, RYOKO.

97
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,666
- AZAKA, KAMIDAKE,
FIRE ALL TORPEDOES.

98
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,375
- YES, MA'AM.

99
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,583
- NOW HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?

100
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,541
- HUH?  WHAT?

101
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,750
- ( Washu laughing )

102
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,958
GIVE IT UP, LITTLE GIRL.

103
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:01,083
I, WASHU, THE GENIUS MASTERMIND
CREATED THAT SHIELD

104
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,500
SO YOU'LL NEVER BREAK
THROUGH IT!

105
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:06,375
HMM.  HOW EXTRAORDINARY.

106
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:09,375
I'VE NEVER SEEN CRYSTALLIZED
ENERGY IN THIS SHAPE BEFORE.

107
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:13,375
SO THIS IS THE FAMOUS
POWER OF JURAI.

108
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:16,791
I SIMPLY CAN'T WAIT TO EXAMINE
ITS MOLECULAR STRUCTURE.

109
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,416
IT IS SO COOL!
( shouts )

110
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,666
- DOWN, GIRL.  YOU'RE NOT DOING
ANY OF YOUR WEIRD EXPERIMENTS

111
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,291
ON THAT ROCK.  THAT STONE IS
WORTH SO MUCH MONEY,

112
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,791
THAT WE'LL NEVER RUN OUT
OF CASH EVEN IF WE LIVE

113
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,583
FOR A ZILLION YEARS,
AND I'VE GOT BIG PLANS FOR IT.

114
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,208
- YEAH, SO DO I.

115
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,750
YOU PROMISED ME
A STATE OF THE ART

116
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,083
PARTICLE CONVERTER, REMEMBER?

117
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,708
AND I FULLY EXPECT YOU
TO PAY UP.

118
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,541
FOR A PIRATE LIKE YOU TO HIRE
A GENIUS LIKE ME,

119
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:43,291
IT'S GONNA COST SOME BUCKS
AND I DON'T MEAN CHUMP CHANGE.

120
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,708
- OKAY.  UGH!

121
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,750
SHE IS PERSISTENT
THAT JURAI PRINCESS.

122
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,125
I'LL GIVE HER THAT.

123
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,583
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

124
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,958
- OH, GOSH, IT LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF FUEL.

125
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,625
THAT'S A PROBLEM.
- WHAT?

126
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,750
MY PROTECTIVE SHIELD
IS OUTSTANDING,

127
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,916
BUT I MUST ADMIT IT DOES TEND
TO USE UP FUEL RATHER QUICKLY.

128
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,875
- YOU BUILT IT OUT
OF SPARE PARTS, DIDN'T YOU?

129
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:09,291
- THE SHIELD IS GONE.  REACTIVE
ENGINE POWER IS DECREASING.

130
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,791
WE'RE IN TROUBLE.
YOU CAN QUOTE ME ON THAT.

131
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,416
- THAT'S JUST GREAT.
YOU CAUSED THIS.  YOU FIX IT.

132
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,750
- THERE'S NOTHING TO FIX.
WE'RE JUST OUT OF FUEL.

133
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,208
ERGO, WE NEED FUEL,
BUT THERE'S NO FUEL STATIONS

134
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,250
IN THIS REMOTE REGION
OF THE UNIVERSE.

135
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,041
BINGO.  WE CAN DRAW ENERGY
FROM THIS SOLAR SYSTEM.

136
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:27,041
THE THIRD PLANET HAS A MASSIVE
SUPPLY.  IT'S CALLED EARTH.

137
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,875
- ( screaming )

138
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,791
- THEIR PROTECTIVE SHIELD
IS GONE.

139
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,291
NOW'S THE TIME
FOR A FULL FRONTAL ATTACK.

140
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,625
- ABSOLUTELY.
THAT SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

141
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,750
- REACTIVE ENGINES ONE AND TWO
HAVE GONE OUT.

142
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:49,041
WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO MAKE
A RUN FOR THE EARTH QUICK.

143
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,125
WASHU, HANG ON GOOD AND TIGHT.

144
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:01,375
- THEY'RE GETTING AWAY!
- BUT WE'LL CATCH 'EM.

145
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,750
- SHIFT TO FULL POWER.
- YES, MA'AM.

146
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,666
- HUH?  THERE IT IS,
PLANET EARTH.

147
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,583
- MM-HMM.

148
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,333
- IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE HEADING
FOR THE EARTH.

149
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:23,125
- KIYONE, THE REAR MONITOR.
LOOK!

150
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,666
- OH, WHAT IS THAT?

151
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,958
PRINCESS AYEKA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

152
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,000
I THOUGHT YOU TOLD US
TO HANDLE THIS.

153
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,250
- WELL, YES, WITH MY HELP
OF COURSE.

154
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,750
I PLAN TO USE
MY THUNDERFLASH CANNON.

155
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,625
THAT'LL IMMOBILIZE THEIR SHIP.
YOU CAN RETRIEVE THE LIGHTSTONE.

156
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,875
- YES, MA'AM.
- LOCK ON THE TARGET.

157
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,208
- REMEMBER, THEY HAVE
THE JURAI LIGHTSTONE.

158
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,291
SO DON'T BLOW UP THEIR SHIP
NO MATTER WHAT.

159
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,250
- YES, WE UNDERSTAND,
YOUR HIGHNESS.

160
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,750
- WE'LL JUST RESTRAIN ITS OUTPUT
ENOUGH TO DISABLE IT.

161
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,833
- THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.
THAT PRINCESS GIRL

162
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,875
IS GONNA FIRE HER THUNDERFLASH.
I JUST KNOW IT.

163
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,208
- NO, SHE'S NOT
'CAUSE I WON'T LET HER.

164
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,750
- THUNDERFLASH, UNLEASH!

165
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,041
- ( screaming )

166
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,250
- ( screaming )
- PRINCESS!

167
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,500
- WE'VE HAD IT, WASHU.
WE'RE FINISHED.  WE'RE THROUGH!

168
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:32,125
- NO, WE'RE NOT.  IT SEEMS WE'RE
BEING DRAWN DOWNWARD

169
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,458
BY SOME UNKNOWN POWER SOURCE.

170
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,041
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

171
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,625
- THE PIRATE SHIP HAS ENTERED
INTO THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE.

172
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,333
- THEY'RE NOT GETTING AWAY
FROM ME.

173
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,500
LOCK ON AND FOLLOW THEM IN.
- YES, MA'AM.

174
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,833
- AYEKA.

175
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:49,750
- OH, THIS IS GREAT.
I'M LATE FOR MY EVENING CHORES.

176
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,041
GRANDPA'S GOING TO BE REALLY MAD
AND WHEN HE GETS MAD--

177
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,666
OH!  HMM?

178
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,750
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

179
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,833
- I LOCATED THE HIGH ENERGY
SOURCE THAT'S THERE.

180
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,500
- HUH?

181
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,750
- ( meows )

182
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,833
- WHY?

183
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:41,333
WHY CAN'T I COMMUNICATE
MY FEELINGS TO TENCHI?

184
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:51,750
( speaks Japanese )

185
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,208
YES, OH, THAT'S IT.

186
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,333
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, AYEKA?

187
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,750
- HMM.  HE'S LATE.

188
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,333
LORD TENCHI IS VERY LATE.
HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE

189
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,166
A LONG TIME AGO.
THERE'S NO EXCUSE.

190
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,125
OH, NO, MAYBE HE'S BEEN
IN AN ACCIDENT OR SOMETHING.

191
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,125
YOU WORRY WAY TOO MUCH,
AYEKA.

192
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,875
HE'LL SHOW UP SOON
JUST LIKE HE DID THE FIRST TIME.

193
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,208
DO YOU REMEMBER HOW
IT ALL HAPPENED?

194
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,125
- HUH?

195
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:24,166
AH, YES, I REMEMBER IT ALL

196
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,791
AS CLEAR AS CAN BE.

197
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,458
- THERE ARE NO SIGNS
OF LIFE DETECTED IN THE SHIP.

198
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,833
THEY MUST HAVE ABANDONED
THE CRAFT AND RUN AWAY.

199
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,000
VERY COWARDLY.

200
00:13:56,541 --> 00:14:00,666
- OH.  THEY COULDN'T HAVE GONE
VERY FAR YET, RIGHT?

201
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,041
WE'LL FIND THEM, YOU'LL SEE.
- RIGHT.

202
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:07,583
- ( panting )

203
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:13,375
RUNNING CHASE ON A WEIRD PLANET
LIKE THIS WASN'T PART

204
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,916
OF OUR DEAL.
HOW DID I GET ROPED INTO THIS?

205
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,791
THAT'S WHAT I WANNA KNOW.

206
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,833
- NO ONE'S FORCING YOU.
STAY BACK AND GET CAUGHT

207
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,083
BY THE GALAXY POLICE
IF YOU WANT.

208
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,750
- YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING.

209
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,708
NOBODY'S GONNA PUT
A GENIUS SCIENTIST LIKE ME

210
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,708
IN SOME JAIL.
IT'S PREPOSTEROUS.

211
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,916
AND I'M NOT JUST THINKING
OF MYSELF, EITHER.

212
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,250
IT'D BE A GREAT LOSS
FOR THE SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENT

213
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,291
OF THE WHOLE UNIVERSE
AND YOU'D BE ON YOUR OWN!

214
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,166
- ALL RIGHT,
DON'T GET SO WORKED UP.

215
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,750
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THIS WHOLE THING.

216
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,458
WE FIND OUR TARGET.

217
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,958
NEXT WE CAPTURE HIM
AND TAKE THE ENERGY FROM HIM.

218
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,750
THEN WE REPAIR THE SHIP AND GET
THE HECK OFF THIS PLANET.

219
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,208
THEY'LL NEVER KNOW
WHAT HIT 'EM.

220
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:53,166
- SOUNDS GOOD, BUT WHY DO I
DETECT SUCH A HIGH ENERGY

221
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,041
REACTION FROM OUR TARGET HUMAN?

222
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,916
HE JUST LOOKS LIKE
A PLAIN OLD ORDINARY LIFE FORM.

223
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,125
HMM?  OH!

224
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,500
- DARN.
- SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHEN

225
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:07,458
TO GIVE UP.
- SEARCHING, SEARCHING.

226
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:11,125
SEARCHING.
- SEARCHING. SEARCHING.

227
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:14,041
I DETECT LIVING ORGANISMS.

228
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:17,250
- I KNOW YOU'RE
OUT THERE, RYOKO.  HUH?

229
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,333
- THINGS SEEM TO BE GETTING
OUT OF HAND, RYO-OHKI.

230
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:38,666
- ( meows )

231
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,333
- OH, WOW, IT LOOKS KIND OF LIKE
PLANET JURAI HERE.

232
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,083
- ( screaming )

233
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,166
- THAT WAS A FATAL MISTAKE,
PRINCESS.

234
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,625
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO DIE
IF YOU HADN'T BEEN SO FOOLHARDY.

235
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,625
UGH!  WAS THAT SUPPOSED
TO BE SOME KIND OF ATTACK

236
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,208
OR SOMETHING?
- ( growls )

237
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,125
- I AM AYEKA, THE FIRST
PRINCESS OF JURAI

238
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,458
AND DON'T EVER UNDERESTIMATE
MY POWER.

239
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,500
NOW COME ON, RYOKO,
YOU SPACE PIRATE,

240
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,625
YOU RETURN THE JURAI LIGHTSTONE,
AND I MAY EVEN LET YOU ESCAPE

241
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,250
- WITH YOUR LIFE.
- HA!  YOU THINK I'D GIVE IT

242
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,583
TO YOU JUST BECAUSE YOU SAY SO?
THAT'S A LAUGH.

243
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:29,541
LET'S SEE YOU TAKE IT.
( laughs )

244
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,458
- ( shouts )
- WELL, GO ON.

245
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,125
YOU'RE SUCH A TOUGH PRINCESS
COME AND GET IT.

246
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,958
- NO, WAIT, PRINCESS AYEKA,
PLEASE.

247
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,583
- LET US TAKE CARE OF HER.

248
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:44,291
- ( laughs )
YOU GUARDIANS ARE GOING DOWN.

249
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,708
( grunts )

250
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,125
NOT BAD.
- OUR TURN!

251
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,958
- ( screams )

252
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,291
- RYOKO!

253
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,791
- ( chuckles )

254
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,791
- ( grunts )

255
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,708
- YOUR INSULTS CAN NEVER
BE FORGIVEN.

256
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:06,083
BUT SINCE WE'RE IN THE PRESENCE
OF A PRINCESS,

257
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,791
WE WON'T PUNISH YOU IF YOU
RETURN THE JURAI LIGHTSTONE NOW.

258
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:12,333
- YOUR TIME IS UP.  SURRENDER
THE JURAI LIGHTSTONE AT ONCE.

259
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,458
- WHATEVER WAS I THINKING.

260
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,250
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU ROYAL GUARDS
WERE SO TOUGH,

261
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:19,791
SO LET'S SEE
HOW YOU TAKE ...THIS!

262
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,375
- THERE IS NO USE TRYING
THAT MANEUVER AGAIN.

263
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,583
- SHE'S DISAPPEARED.
- WHERE IS SHE?

264
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,750
- YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO DODGE MY BLAST NOW.

265
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,125
NOT AT THIS DISTANCE.

266
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:35,041
SO LONG.  HA!

267
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:39,541
WHAT?  ( screaming )

268
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,958
- AZAKA, KAMIDAKE,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

269
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,708
- YES, THANK YOU, PRINCESS.
- THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.

270
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,166
- HANG ON, RYOKO.

271
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,833
- THEY GOT ME THIS TIME.

272
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:52,125
- SO THIS IS THE ILLUSTRIOUS
SPACE PIRATE RYOKO.

273
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,125
WELL, SINCE YOUR POWERS
ARE NO MATCH FOR MINE,

274
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,791
YOU MIGHT AS WELL GIVE IT UP
AND SURRENDER THE LIGHTSTONE.

275
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,791
- I'LL NEVER SURRENDER
AND IF YOU TRY TO FORCE ME TO,

276
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,583
I'LL--
- WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

277
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,500
- STAY CALM
DON'T GET CRAZY, RYOKO.

278
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:09,041
- I'LL BLOW YOU SKY HIGH
WITH THE JURAI POWER SEALED

279
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,458
IN THIS STONE.

280
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,916
- OH, NO!

281
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,875
- ( grunting )

282
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,916
- ( gasps )

283
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,166
- WHERE ARE YOU?
AYEKA, AZAKA, KAMIDAKE!

284
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,375
WHERE IN THE WORLD ARE THEY?
THEY JUST VANISHED.

285
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:39,333
AYEKA, AZAKA, KAMIDAKE!

286
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,833
( whimpering )
- ( screeches )

287
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,708
- ( shouts )
- ( gasps )

288
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,708
A HUMANOID ON THIS PLANET?
- A LITTLE GIRL?

289
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,875
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?

290
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,500
WHAT'S WRONG, LITTLE GIRL?
WHERE ARE YOU FROM

291
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,875
AND WHY AREN'T YOU
WITH YOUR PARENTS?

292
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,125
- I GOT LOST, YOU SEE?

293
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,041
- SOMETHING HUGE FELL
FROM THE SKY

294
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:02,000
AND CRASHED INTO THAT MOUNTAIN.
IT COULD CAUSE A FIRE OUT HERE.

295
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,291
IT'S DANGEROUS TO STAY HERE.
COME ON.

296
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,458
- WAIT!
- HEY!

297
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,541
- AYEKA, I'M COMING.
- HEY, COME BACK.

298
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:14,000
- ( groaning )

299
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,875
AZAKA, KAMIDAKE!

300
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,333
- WOW!  SO THAT'S THE JURAI
POWER THAT WAS HIDDEN

301
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,750
IN THAT LITTLE CRYSTAL.

302
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,208
- ( gasps )
- ( screaming )

303
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
- ( screaming )
- WHAT A SLUGGER.

304
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:37,708
- AYEKA, IT'S ME!

305
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,500
AYEKA!  AYEKA!

306
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,500
- SASAMI, NO, STAY AWAY.

307
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:44,208
- ( growls )
- AYEKA!

308
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,666
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- WHO ARE YOU?

309
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,125
- WHAT IS THAT DEMON THING?
- YOU'RE IN DANGER HERE.

310
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,125
FLEE QUICKLY.

311
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,958
- WHOA!

312
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,916
- THIS IS--
IT'S MY MOTHER'S.

313
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,416
- THAT'S IT.
THAT'S THE POWER SOURCE

314
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,291
WE WERE LOOKING FOR.  THE ENERGY
THAT DREW US DOWN HERE.

315
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:15,041
- HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?
WHAT IS IT?

316
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,041
- ( screaming )

317
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,916
- ( screaming )

318
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,208
- NO!  ( panting )

319
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:48,666
WHAT HAVE I DONE?
- RYOKO.

320
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,208
- PRINCESS AYEKA,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

321
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,041
- ( sirens wailing )

322
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:05,666
- HMM.

323
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:13,291
- IT'S SURE GOOD TO BE HOME.
- Girl: TENCHI'S HOME!

324
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:16,500
LORD TENCHI!
- Ryoko: SO HE'S HOME, HUH?

325
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,916
- YES, HE'S BACK.
HE'S EARLY.

326
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,083
- TENCHI, I MISSED YOU SO MUCH!

327
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,916
- WELCOME HOME.
- RYOKO, TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF

328
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,333
LORD TENCHI THIS INSTANT.
- IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

329
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:27,875
BESIDES,
TODAY'S THE ANNIVERSARY

330
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,833
OF THE DAY TENCHI
AND I FIRST MET.

331
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,750
- YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO MET HIM THAT DAY.

332
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,750
- COME ON, TENCHI, PARTY!
PARTY!

333
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,041
- ( all laughing )

334
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:46,250
- ( theme music playing )

335
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:06,208
- ( screeches )

336
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:15,875
- HI, I'M TENCHI MASAKI.
I'M BACK HOME IN OKAYAMA NOW.

337
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:19,291
I DID SOMETHING REALLY TERRIBLE
ON A SPECIAL DAY TWO YEARS AGO.

338
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:21,958
I WAS WEARING A NECKLACE
MY MOTHER HAD GIVEN ME,

339
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:24,041
A VERY SPECIAL
AND MAGICAL NECKLACE,

340
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,958
RYOKO AND EVERYONE ELSE
WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT BETTER OFF

341
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:29,416
IF I HADN'T BEEN WEARING IT,
BUT THEN AGAIN,

342
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,000
IF I HADN'T BEEN WEARING IT,
I WOULD NEVER HAVE MADE FRIENDS

343
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:34,875
WITH SIX AMAZING GIRLS
ALL AT ONCE, EITHER.

344
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:37,625
THE NEXT EPISODE
OF THE NEW TENCHI MUYO SERIES...

345
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,958
"TENCHI ANNIVERSARY."
