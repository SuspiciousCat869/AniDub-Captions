1
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,500
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:12,083
- ( sighs )

3
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,250
OKAY.

4
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:45,041
ALL RIGHT.

5
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,583
THERE'S NO BETTER REWARD
THAN A CUP OF STEAMING TEA.

6
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,041
- ( phone rings )

7
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,458
- HELLO.
TENCHI MASAKI.

8
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,458
- Sasami: TENCHI,
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME.

9
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,916
- IS THIS SASAMI?

10
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,750
- EVERYBODY'S AFTER ME.

11
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,458
- MEOW.

12
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,125
- SASAMI, WHAT'S UP?

13
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,875
SO WHAT'S HAPPENED?
HOW COME YOU'RE SO UPSET?

14
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,208
- ( sighs ) ALL RIGHT.

15
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,208
IT ALL BEGAN
WHEN RYO-OHKI AND I

16
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,666
WERE PERFORMING SOME TRICKS
FOR PEOPLE ON THE STREET

17
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,208
AND MADE
QUITE A BIT OF MONEY.

18
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,166
- ( applause )
- ( coins dinging )

19
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,458
- THE NEXT THING
I KNEW,

20
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,458
EVERYONE AT HOME
WAS TRYING TO STEAL IT.

21
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,375
- REALLY?
- MM-HMM.

22
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,500
- ( insects chirping )
- ( bird hooting )

23
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,208
- ( Sasami breathing deeply )
- MEOW.

24
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,166
MEOW.

25
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,291
MEOW.

26
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,625
- ( girls gasp )

27
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,708
- WAIT A MINUTE.
THERE ARE TOO MANY HANDS HERE.

28
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,458
HA!

29
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,416
- ( all shouting )

30
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,416
- Ryoko: STOP IT.

31
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
- ( sighs )
- MEOW?

32
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,333
- ( girls moaning )
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING

33
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,958
CRAWLING AROUND HERE
AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT?

34
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:53,333
- ME?  WHAT ABOUT YOU?
- HEY, WHY ARE ANY OF YOU HERE?

35
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,875
IT'S LATE.
- MEOW, MEOW, MEOW.

36
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,791
- WHEN I WOKE UP, I REALIZED
I NEEDED SOME CHANGE.

37
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,291
I KNEW
YOU HAD MONEY.

38
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,375
I FIGURED YOU WOULDN'T MIND
IF I BORROWED IT.

39
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:09,041
- ( giggles )
SASAMI, I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND.

40
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,208
I NEEDED THE MONEY TO RETRIEVE
THE GALAXY POLICE IDENTIFICATION

41
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,208
AND HANDCUFFS
THAT I PAWNED LAST WEEK.

42
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,041
- IF WE DON'T RETRIEVE
THEM VERY SOON,

43
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,708
THEY'RE GONNA SELL THEM.
THAT WOULD BE

44
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,041
PRETTY EMBARRASSING WHEN WE
GO BACK TO HEADQUARTERS.

45
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,000
I DON'T KNOW IF WE COULD
EVER EXPLAIN IT.

46
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,250
- I NEEDED THE MONEY
FOR MY LATEST EXPERIMENT.

47
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,333
I'M A FEW BYTES SHY
OF A MOTHERBOARD,

48
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,750
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

49
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,958
- IT IS MY DUTY AS A WOMAN
TO MAINTAIN MY APPEARANCE

50
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,958
AND STAY BEAUTIFUL
FOR THE MAN I LOVE,

51
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,416
AND THEREFORE
I'M DUTY-BOUND

52
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,458
TO BUY THIS SEVEN-ITEM
BEAUTY CARE SET.

53
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,041
- HUH?

54
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,041
- SASAMI, THE FACT
OF THE MATTER IS,

55
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,208
YOU DON'T PLAN
TO SPEND THAT MONEY.

56
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,500
LET ME HAVE IT.

57
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,916
- WE'RE DESPERATE.

58
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,958
WE'RE COMPLETELY
BROKE, SASAMI.

59
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,250
- WE'LL PAY EVERY YEN BACK,
REALLY.

60
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,375
- I'LL BE SO GRATEFUL.

61
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,250
- IT WOULD JUST BE
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

62
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,416
- ( whimpering )

63
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,291
- PLEASE.

64
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,208
- PLEASE.

65
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,291
- PLEASE.

66
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,416
- PLEASE.

67
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,083
- PLEASE, SASAMI..

68
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:14,875
- ( Sasami screams )

69
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,541
ANYWAY, THAT'S WHY
I CAME TO SEE YOU.

70
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,375
- MEOW, MEOW.
- THAT'S AWFUL.

71
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,291
THEY'RE ALL BEING
SO GREEDY AND SELFISH.

72
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,416
BUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
ABOUT IT, SASAMI?

73
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,458
YOU HAVE TO GO BACK SOMETIME.
YOU CAN'T STAY HERE FOREVER.

74
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,041
I'M GOING TO BE LEAVING
IN THE MORNING TO GO TO SCHOOL.

75
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,291
- I KNOW.

76
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,666
OH.

77
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,541
- ( distant horns honking )

78
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,166
- ( gasps )

79
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,500
I COULD SPEND IT ALL.

80
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:41,666
- HUH?

81
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,333
- ( Yugi laughing )

82
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:52,708
I HAVE A SOLUTION
TO YOUR PROBLEM, SASAMI.

83
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,541
OH, YES.

84
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,375
WHY DON'T YOU COME
AND PLAY WITH ME?

85
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,791
IT'LL GIVE YOU A CHANCE
TO SEE MY WORLD.

86
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,708
TSUGARU.

87
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:14,041
- ( laughs )

88
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,875
COME HERE, TENCHI.
YOU'VE GOT TO SEE THIS.

89
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,250
- HUH?

90
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,625
WHAT IS IT?
- LOOK.

91
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,291
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

92
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:29,333
- IT'S ALL MADE OF CHOCOLATE.
WOW.

93
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,666
- MEOW.

94
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,875
MEOW!

95
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,416
MEOW.

96
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,000
MEOW!
- COME BACK, RYO-OHKI.

97
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,166
- MEOW!

98
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,041
( screaming )

99
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,250
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

100
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:53,750
( giggles )

101
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,083
( laughs )

102
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,541
THAT'S A BUNCH OF CARROTS
YOU HARVESTED.

103
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:58,916
- ( both laughing )

104
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,458
- HUH?  WHAT IS IT?

105
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,875
- OH, NOTHING MUCH.
I WAS JUST THINKING,

106
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,666
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
WE'RE HAVING A DATE.

107
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,375
- OH?

108
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,208
MM.

109
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,291
- ( chuckles )

110
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,833
- MEOW?

111
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,208
- SO WHY DON'T WE CHECK OUT
THE STORES ACROSS THE STREET?

112
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,958
- Tenchi: GOOD IDEA.
- MM?

113
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,375
MEOW.

114
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,916
MEOW, MEOW.

115
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,166
- ( chuckles )

116
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,125
- HUH?

117
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,333
- WHAT'S THE MATTER,
SASAMI?

118
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,250
- OH, NOTHING.

119
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,708
I'M JUST JUMPY.

120
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,750
OH, MY,
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE

121
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,500
HOW MANY PRETTY THINGS
THESE STORES HAVE.

122
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,458
- SASAMI, SLOW DOWN,
WILL YOU?

123
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:13,625
- YO!  COME ON, TENCHI.
YOU'RE REALLY OUT OF SHAPE.

124
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,458
YOU NEED MORE EXERCISE.
- MEOW, MEOW.

125
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,458
- ( Sasami sighs )

126
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,125
OH.

127
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,500
( giggles )

128
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,333
HMM.

129
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,708
- ( panting )

130
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,541
SASAMI?
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

131
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,333
SASAMI!

132
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,791
- HEY, LOOK.
SO PRETTY.

133
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,000
MM.

134
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,500
- HELLO.  DID YOU FIND
SOMETHING YOU LIKE?

135
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,791
- UH...

136
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,791
- YOU SHOULD TRY IT ON.

137
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,666
EVERYTHING'S ON SALE,
HALF OFF.

138
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,000
- MEOW!

139
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,333
- WHAT IN THE WORLD?
- THAT'S QUITE A TEMPER.

140
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,000
HAVE I DONE
SOMETHING WRONG?

141
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,375
- THIS IS WEIRD.
- MEOW!

142
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,500
- I DON'T KNOW.
THIS DOESN'T USUALLY HAPPEN.

143
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,000
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'LL KEEP MY DISTANCE.

144
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:32,000
IF YOU FIND SOMETHING
YOU LIKE, JUST LET ME KNOW.

145
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,250
- HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU TODAY?

146
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,416
- MEOW.

147
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,875
- AH, I TURN MY BACK
FOR A MINUTE,

148
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,500
AND SHE DISAPPEARS.

149
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,875
HUH?  WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
I WAS WORRIED.

150
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:47,291
- HOW POLITE.
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

151
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,291
- SAKUYA, I'M SURPRISED.

152
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,458
- I WAS HOPING
WE MIGHT HAVE A TALK.

153
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,250
- OH, YEAH?
I'M KIND OF BUSY, SAKUYA.

154
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,458
- I JUST WANT YOU
TO WALK WITH ME A LITTLE BIT.

155
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,916
- UH, OKAY.

156
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,166
- ( quiet tune playing )
- HUH?

157
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,625
- MEOW?

158
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,625
- OH, WOW.
FABULOUS.

159
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,166
HUH?

160
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,416
( gasps )

161
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,916
- MEOW.

162
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,125
MEOW.

163
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,291
- MEOW, MEOW.

164
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,208
- ( birds chirping )

165
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,250
- Ryoko: MY STOMACH CAN'T TAKE
MUCH MORE OF THIS.

166
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,833
IT REALLY MISSES THE FOOD
I USED TO PUT IN IT.

167
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,791
- ( stomach growling )

168
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:06,458
- SASAMI, IF I HAD ANY MONEY,
I'D PAY YOU TO COOK.

169
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,458
- IN MY WILDEST DREAMS
I NEVER THOUGHT

170
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,291
WE'D STARVE TO DEATH ON A PLANET
WITH SO MUCH FOOD ALL AROUND.

171
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,625
YOU KNOW,
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

172
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,083
WE WOULDN'T HAVE
TO GO THROUGH THIS

173
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,291
IF YOU HADN'T TRIED TO GRAB
ALL OF SASAMI'S MONEY.

174
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,041
- AND I WOULD HAVE
GOT IT,

175
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,791
IF YOUR HAND HADN'T BEEN
THERE BEFORE ME.

176
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,125
- ( stomach growling )

177
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,958
- NEVER MIND.
I'M TOO WEAK TO FIGHT.

178
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:26,125
- DON'T WORRY, EVERYONE.
DUE TO THE CURRENT EMERGENCY,

179
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,125
I VOLUNTEER TO COOK
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

180
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,708
- NO WAY.
THAT'S A RECIPE FOR DISASTER.

181
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,208
IF YOU SET FOOT IN THERE, YOU'RE
GOING TO BREAK THE FAUCET,

182
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,708
CHOP THE CUTTING BOARD
IN HALF,

183
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,208
SMASH ALL THE PLATES
AND GLASSES,

184
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:39,291
INCINERATE THE POTS AND
SOMEHOW CAUSE A GAS EXPLOSION.

185
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,333
- WHAT A HORRIBLE THING
TO SAY.

186
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,000
ARE YOU IMPLYING
THAT I'M INCOMPETENT?

187
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:47,000
- ( all groaning )
- ( Ryoko laughs )

188
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,416
- HUH?
- OH.

189
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,000
- OH.

190
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,625
- SOMETHING SMELLS YUMMY, AND
IT'S COMING FROM THE KITCHEN.

191
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,125
- YES, BUT WHO'S
IN THERE?

192
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,708
NOBODY AROUND HERE
KNOWS HOW TO COOK.

193
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,041
- ( all mumbling )

194
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,625
- TIME FOR DINNER.

195
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,416
- WASHU, YOU SAVED
OUR LIVES.

196
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,916
- WHAT DID YOU MAKE
FOR US?

197
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,291
IT SMELLS SO RICH,
CREAMY AND DREAMY.

198
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,250
- YOU DIDN'T HAPPEN
TO BREAK ANY DISHES

199
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,833
WHILE YOU WERE IN THERE
COOKING, DID YOU?

200
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,708
- NOT EVERYONE'S
A BUTTER-FINGERS.

201
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,333
I HAVE TO ADMIT,
WASHU,

202
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,458
I HAD NO IDEA
YOU KNEW HOW TO COOK.

203
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:26,041
- BOTTOM LINE,
I CAN'T BOIL WATER.

204
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,958
- HUH?

205
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,250
- TOO MUCH WORK.

206
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,250
HOWEVER, I CAN DUPLICATE
THE COOKING PROCESS

207
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,166
BY MANIPULATING
A DNA SEQUENCE.

208
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,875
HUH?

209
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,875
- UGH.

210
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,041
- I GUARANTEE
IT'LL BE DELICIOUS.

211
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,041
WHO WANTS TO BE
THE FIRST ONE TO DIG IN?

212
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,000
- ARGH!

213
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:49,541
( girls screaming )

214
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,541
- ( distant horns honking )

215
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,458
- YOU GONNA BUY IT?

216
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,583
- WHAT?
- THIS PIECE HERE.

217
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,916
- OH, I MIGHT WANT TO.

218
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,916
- MEOW.

219
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,125
- ( giggles )

220
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,291
WHAT A CUTE PET YOU HAVE.
HERE.

221
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,666
( giggles )

222
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,333
I'M YUGI.

223
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,791
- OH, HOW RUDE OF ME.
MY NAME'S SASAMI.

224
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,250
PLEASED TO MEET YOU.
- MEOW.

225
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,083
- I WOULDN'T FORGET YOU.
THIS IS RYO-OHKI.

226
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,625
- HI.

227
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,583
YOU'RE JUST PRECIOUS.
HOW ARE YOU?

228
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,708
- MEOW.

229
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,125
- Sasami: LOOK.
- ( both girls giggling )

230
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,291
- I THINK I'LL WEAR THIS
TO MY NEXT PARTY

231
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,291
AND SEE IF ANYBODY
NOTICES.

232
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,916
- ( both giggling )

233
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,000
- I'M SURE
YOU'LL LOVE THIS.

234
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,250
- LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

235
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,458
I JUST MET YOU,
BUT WE'RE FRIENDS, RIGHT?

236
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,000
- UH...

237
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,416
OF COURSE WE'RE FRIENDS.

238
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,791
- GOOD.
IN THAT CASE,

239
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,625
WHY DON'T YOU COME TO MY HOUSE
AND WE'LL PLAY?

240
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,041
- NOW?
WELL, I GUESS I COULD.

241
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,375
- HOORAY!
JUST FOLLOW ME.

242
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,750
- I'M AFRAID THERE'S NO EXIT
OVER THERE.

243
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,708
- OH, SURE THERE IS.
WATCH.

244
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,416
- OH?  OH.

245
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,416
- COME ON, SASAMI.

246
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,416
RIGHT THIS WAY.

247
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,333
HURRY.
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.

248
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,041
OH!

249
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,250
( gasps ) OH.

250
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,291
WHERE ARE WE?

251
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,208
- SASAMI!
( echoing )

252
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,250
COME ON, FOLLOW ME.

253
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,375
- YUGI, WAIT UP.

254
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,583
( screams )

255
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,625
WHERE ARE WE?
- I SEE YOU FINALLY WOKE UP.

256
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,791
- MEOW.

257
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,291
- OH, THERE YOU ARE.

258
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,750
- OF COURSE.
LET'S PLAY HERE, OKAY?

259
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,458
- OKAY.  BUT--

260
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,125
- BUT WHAT?

261
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,625
- I FEEL THERE'S SOMETHING
UNPLEASANT AROUND HERE.

262
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,041
- REALLY?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

263
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,083
- A DEFINITE FEELING
OF SOMETHING EVIL.

264
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,416
- EVIL?

265
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,416
- I REALLY DON'T THINK
IT'S SAFE TO STAY HERE.

266
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,291
THERE MUST BE A WAY
OUT OF THIS PLACE.

267
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,041
COME ON,
LET'S FIND IT.

268
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,166
- ( panting )

269
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,291
- ( voice laughing )
- ( gasps )

270
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,208
WHO'S THERE?

271
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,750
- WHAT ARE YOU
PANICKING FOR?

272
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,750
THERE'S NOWHERE TO RUN.

273
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,666
HIYAH!
- WATCH OUT!

274
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,041
( whimpers )

275
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,166
- YOU'RE TRAPPED IN THE WORLD
INSIDE THE MIRROR.

276
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,333
YOU MIGHT AS WELL ACCEPT
THAT THERE'S NO ESCAPE.

277
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,125
- I REFUSE
TO BELIEVE THAT.

278
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,416
OH!

279
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,625
WE'VE GOT TO
MAKE A RUN FOR IT, YUGI.

280
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,750
HELP!
SOMEBODY HELP!

281
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:27,916
- HUH?

282
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,125
- MEOW!

283
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,791
- LEAVE US ALONE,
YOU BULLY.

284
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,791
- ( laughs )
HOW VERY IMPOLITE OF YOU.

285
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,750
YOU SAID
YOU WANTED TO PLAY.

286
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:51,375
- NOW I WANT TO GO.
- THAT'S QUITE IMPOSSIBLE.

287
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,083
IF YOU INSIST
ON LEAVING,

288
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,166
I'LL HAVE TO KILL YOU.

289
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,083
HIYAH!

290
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,833
- ( screams )

291
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,250
- MEOW!

292
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,750
MEOW!

293
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,291
- ARGH!
- ( meowing )

294
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,416
- THANKS FOR SAVING ME,
RYO-OHKI.

295
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,541
- THERE'S MORE.

296
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,000
- ( gasps )
- WATCH OUT, YUGI.

297
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,291
( screams )

298
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,583
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO BE HURT.

299
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,541
- UH...

300
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,333
- ( Tsugaru laughs )

301
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,541
YOU SHOULD LEARN
TO BEHAVE.

302
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,541
NOW, I'M AFRAID, YOU'LL HAVE TO
PAY THE ULTIMATE PENALTY.

303
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,416
WHA--?  WHAT'S THIS?

304
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,750
- ( meowing )

305
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,041
- WHO ARE YOU?

306
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,916
HEE-YAH!

307
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,916
- ( meowing )

308
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,583
MEOW, MEOW, MEOW!

309
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,708
- YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS.

310
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,208
- MEOW, MEOW, MEOW!

311
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,166
- NOW BLAST A PASSAGE
FOR US.

312
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,625
- MEOW.

313
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:29,916
- OPEN FIRE!

314
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,833
- MEOW, MEOW!

315
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,875
- ( both scream )

316
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,583
- OH.
- MEOW.

317
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:57,041
- YUGI, YOU MADE IT OUT?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

318
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,166
- MM-HMM.

319
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:02,750
- ( gasps )

320
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,916
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
SASAMI?

321
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,083
- MM-HMM.

322
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,541
- SASAMI!
- HUH?

323
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,166
- ( panting )

324
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,583
OH, I WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
I WAS LOOKING EVERYWHERE.

325
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,833
PLEASE DON'T EVER GO OFF
ON YOUR OWN LIKE THAT.

326
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,458
- I'M SORRY, TENCHI,
BUT I MET SOMEONE NEW.

327
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,833
SEE?  HERE SHE IS.

328
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,791
HER NAME'S YUGI, AND WE'VE
ALREADY BECOME GOOD FRIENDS.

329
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,541
- A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

330
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,333
- OH, HOW DO YOU DO?

331
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,791
- I SAVED THIS.

332
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,291
IT BELONGS TO YOU.

333
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,791
- OH.

334
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,625
THANK YOU.

335
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,500
I THOUGHT
IT WAS LOST FOREVER.

336
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,875
AWW.
- ( quiet tune playing )

337
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:44,208
- A MUSIC BOX IS NICE,
BUT KIND OF DEPRESSING.

338
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:47,333
NO MATTER HOW CHEERFUL
THE MUSIC IS AT THE BEGINNING,

339
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:50,125
YOU KNOW THAT EVENTUALLY
IT'S GOING TO WIND DOWN

340
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,583
AND STOP PLAYING.

341
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,666
- TENCHI, LET ME
ASK YOU AGAIN.

342
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,291
PLEASE BE MY BOYFRIEND.

343
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,416
I REALLY WANT YOU
TO GO STEADY WITH ME.

344
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,375
- LISTEN TO ME.

345
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,041
I'M SORRY,

346
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,541
I'M JUST NOT READY
FOR A RELATIONSHIP YET.

347
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,541
- YOU-- YOU DON'T LIKE ME?

348
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,541
- SAKUYA, PLEASE,

349
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,875
I DIDN'T MEAN TO--
- ( sobbing )

350
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,541
- TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

351
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,500
MM.

352
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:24,041
- BYE, SASAMI.
I'LL SEE YOU SOMETIME SOON.

353
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,666
- ( all moaning )
- ( stomach growling )

354
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,625
- Ryoko: I HAVEN'T EATEN
IN DAYS.

355
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,916
SOON I'LL BE NOTHING
BUT SKIN AND BONES.

356
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,375
- ( stomach growling )
- All: WHERE ARE YOU, SASAMI?

357
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:41,083
PLEASE COME BACK!

358
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,416
- ( upbeat song playing )

359
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:05,875
- MEOW, MEOW.

360
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:06,833
MEOW.

361
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:10,416
MEOW.

362
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,291
- I'M KIYONE,

363
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,958
FIRST-CLASS DETECTIVE
IN THE GALAXY POLICE.

364
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:18,083
WE'RE ALL EXCITED BECAUSE IT'S
TENCHI ANNIVERSARY TOMORROW,

365
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:20,166
THE MOST MEMORABLE DAY
OF OUR LIVES

366
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,166
WHEN WE FIRST
MET TENCHI.

367
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:25,166
TIME REALLY FLIES.
TWO YEARS HAVE ALREADY PASSED

368
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,833
SINCE THE DAY WE CRASH-LANDED
ON THE FACE OF EARTH.

369
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:30,291
THAT TURNED OUT TO BE
THE DAY OF MY DOOM.

370
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,166
YES, THAT WAS WHEN ALL MY
CAREER AMBITIONS

371
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,166
WERE CRASHED
TO PIECES.

372
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,958
THE NEXT EPISODE OF THE NEW
"TENCHI MUYO" SERIES,

373
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,916
"THE DAY WE MET."
