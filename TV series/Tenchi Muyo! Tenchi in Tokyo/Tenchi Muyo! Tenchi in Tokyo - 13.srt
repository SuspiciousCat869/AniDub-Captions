1
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,458
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,833
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,833
- Yugi: SASAMI.

4
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,958
SASAMI!

5
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,875
- ( Yugi laughs )
- ( gasps )

6
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,583
- Sasami:
WHO-- WHO IS IT?

7
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,791
WHO'S CALLING ME?

8
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,250
IT'S YOU.

9
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,666
YUGI.  YUGI.
IT IS YOU, ISN'T IT?

10
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,375
- YOU REMEMBERED ME.

11
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:38,500
- OF COURSE.
I WOULD NEVER FORGET YOU.

12
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:43,041
- SASAMI, COME TO THE LAKE
IN THE HILLS

13
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,916
BEHIND YOUR HOUSE TOMORROW,

14
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,125
WHEN THE FULL MOON RISES
IN THE EASTERN SKY.

15
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,541
- LAKE IN THE HILLS
BEHIND THE HOUSE.

16
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:54,875
SURE, I'LL BE THERE.
CAN I BRING RYO-OHKI WITH ME?

17
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,416
- YES, BUT PLEASE BE SURE
TO COME.

18
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,208
PROMISE ME.

19
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,291
- Sasami: OH!

20
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,916
- WHAT WERE YOU
DREAMING OF, YUGI?

21
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,958
- I WENT TO SAY HELLO
TO MY FRIEND.

22
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,083
I TOLD HER THAT I'M COMING
TO SEE HER TOMORROW.

23
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:17,916
- AH, YOU'RE CLOSING IN.
- YES, THEIR FAMILY TIES

24
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,333
MAY BE STRONG, BUT IT'S ABOUT
TO COME APART AT THE SEAMS.

25
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:24,916
AND I WILL TEAR IT TO PIECES
WITH MY OWN HANDS.

26
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,500
( laughing )

27
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:37,041
- ( towel snaps )
- ( Sasami humming )

28
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,416
- ( meowing )

29
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,916
- HUH?  WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
THAT YOU'RE IN A GOOD MOOD?

30
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,375
WELL, I SURE AM.
WANNA KNOW WHY?

31
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,458
- ( meowing )

32
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,333
- THEN I'LL TELL YOU.
LAST NIGHT I SAW A GOOD FRIEND.

33
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:58,500
SHE CAME TO ME IN A DREAM.
- ( meows )

34
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,541
- THE LAKE IN THE HILLS

35
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,916
BEHIND THE HOUSE.

36
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,125
- COME ON!
- ( grunting )

37
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:19,791
- ( shouting )
- SCORE!  WOW!

38
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,958
TENCHI'S STRONGER THAN HE LOOKS.
- ( panting )

39
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,708
- Boy #2: WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?
HE'S ONE OF THOSE COUNTRY BOYS.

40
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,708
- Girl: COME ON, SAKUYA.
- ( all laughing )

41
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,333
- Girl #2: HEY, WAIT FOR ME!
- ( whistle blowing )

42
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,083
- COME ON, GUYS, HUH?

43
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,666
- HI. ( laughs )
I'M STARTING TO LIKE IT HERE.

44
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,000
GUESS DAD WAS RIGHT.

45
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,958
- WAVING TO THE GIRLS,
ARE YOU?

46
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,916
WELL, ISN'T THAT SWEET?
COME ON, COUNTRY BOY,

47
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,083
LET'S SEE HOW YOU HANDLE
MY DOUBLE HAMMER LOCK.

48
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,875
- Tenchi: GET YOUR FOOT OUT
OF MY MOUTH!

49
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,500
- HANG IN THERE, MY SON.

50
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,250
YOU ARE IN THE SPRINGTIME
OF YOUR LIFE.

51
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,875
YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE,
SO ENJOY YOUR YOUTH

52
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:05,041
WITH SOMEONE YOU LOVE
IN A PURE, UPRIGHT

53
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:08,166
AND BEAUTIFUL WAY.
THAT'S MY WISH,

54
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,041
AS YOUR FATHER.

55
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,041
AND THANK GOODNESS THAT GIRL
DOESN'T FLY

56
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,375
OR SHOOT LASER BEAMS OUT
OF HER HANDS,

57
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,791
LIKE YOUR OTHER GIRLFRIENDS.

58
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,958
- ( sighs )

59
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:32,791
MY MOVES ARE TOTALLY OFF LATELY,
AND IT'S BECAUSE TENCHI'S GONE.

60
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,125
I CAN SEE HIM ALL I WANT,
BUT IF I CAN'T BE WITH HIM,

61
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:38,666
WHAT'S THE USE?
LOVE MAKES A GIRL BEAUTIFUL.

62
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,750
FOR THE SAKE OF MY BEAUTY,
TENCHI, DO COME HOME TO ME.

63
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:46,791
( crying ) TENCHI.

64
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,750
WHO CARES?
I LAUGH AT HEARTACHE!

65
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,291
( laughs )

66
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,458
( sighs )

67
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,791
I WONDER WHAT HE'S DOING
RIGHT THIS MINUTE.  ( groans )

68
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,375
- Man: I SEE.
- ( gasps )

69
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,583
- SO HE IS THE ONE
WHO MAKES YOU SO RADIANT.

70
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:04,916
- WHO'S THERE?

71
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,916
- WELL, WELL.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

72
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,750
- IT'S RYOKO.
AND WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

73
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,416
- HOTSUMA.  I LIKE YOU.

74
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,208
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
I CAN'T STAY.

75
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:27,541
COME BACK AGAIN AND WE WILL
SETTLE THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL.

76
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,791
- HOTSUMA!  YOU'RE BACK.

77
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,041
YOU REMEMBERED MY NAME.
I'M HONORED.

78
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,458
HOW UNEXPECTED OF YOU.

79
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,583
- GET OUT OF MY SIGHT,
DAMN YOU!

80
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:43,250
- OH, NO!
THAT MUST BE RYOKO AGAIN.

81
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:46,541
WELL, NEVER MIND.  LET'S GO.

82
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,125
- Ryoko:
YOU TRIED TO HURT TENCHI.

83
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,125
I NEVER FORGIVE ANYONE
FOR THAT.

84
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:56,291
- Hotsuma: VERY LOYAL OF YOU.
I DIDN'T COME HERE TO FIGHT YOU.

85
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,625
- WHO CARES WHAT YOU CAME FOR,
CREEP?

86
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,583
WHATEVER YOU ARE,
IT'S NOT CLOSE TO NORMAL.

87
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:03,208
- LOOK WHO'S TALKING,
RYOKO THE SPACE PIRATE.

88
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,958
- WHAT?

89
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,916
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

90
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,166
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU ANYWAY?

91
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,250
- I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
I'M ONE OF YOUR OWN KIND, RYOKO.

92
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,750
I APOLOGIZE.

93
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,541
I PROMISE I'LL NEVER
HURT TENCHI AGAIN.

94
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,583
I WAS PLAYING A LITTLE GAME
WITH HIM ANYWAY,

95
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,500
AND I SUPPOSE I WAS
A BIT JEALOUS.

96
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,750
- JEALOUS?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

97
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:27,166
- I MEAN THAT

98
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:31,333
I WANT TO BE THE ONE
WHO MAKES YOU RADIANT.

99
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,583
- WHAT?

100
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,000
- I KNOW.  YOU'VE GOT A BIG
CRUSH ON ME, DON'T YOU?

101
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:47,416
MM-HMM.  MM-HMM.  I KNOW.
I KNOW.  IT'S SO TYPICAL.

102
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,041
TWO MEN FIGHT OVER THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN ON EARTH.

103
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,958
OH, I AM SUCH A DIVA.

104
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,916
- HMM.

105
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,208
- WELL, SORRY,
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE A CHANCE.

106
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:59,250
FROM HEAD TO TOE, EVERY PART
OF ME BELONGS TO TENCHI.

107
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,333
THOUGH IF YOU'RE DESPERATE
FOR A GIRLFRIEND,

108
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,333
I COULD INTRODUCE YOU
TO AN UGLY GIRL CALLED AYEKA.

109
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,125
- GO HOME NOW.
- HUH?

110
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,583
- YOUR BELOVED TENCHI IS
IN DEEP TROUBLE.

111
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:10,416
- TROUBLE?
- THAT'S WHY I CAME HERE.

112
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,458
TO WARN YOU.
- HEY!

113
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,416
I DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL.

114
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
- ( wind howling )

115
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,583
- THE WIND IS HOWLING, AND THE
CLOUDS ARE SMEARED WITH BLOOD.

116
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:39,333
SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

117
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,458
- ( whimpering )

118
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,333
- THAT DOES IT, OLD MAN.

119
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,416
JUST WHAT KIND OF FATHER,
ARE YOU?

120
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,416
- HOW COULD YOU ALLOW TENCHI
TO GET TOGETHER WITH THAT WENCH?

121
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,125
- IT ISN'T FAIR.
YOU WENT ALL THE WAY THERE

122
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,416
TO SEE TENCHI AND YOU
DIDN'T EVEN TELL US.

123
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,291
- YOU TRICKED US, NOBUYUKI.
- HMM? ( laughs )

124
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:03,416
- ( screaming )
NO!  HELP ME!

125
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,250
- NO, I CAN'T STAND IT.

126
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,958
TENCHI IS THERE
WITH THAT MINX.

127
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,958
THEY COULD BE DOING ANYTHING,
JUST IMAGINE.

128
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:14,625
- NO, NOT TENCHI.  HE WOULDN'T.
- YEAH, DON'T BE SO SURE.

129
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,291
TENCHI IS A GUY
AND MEN GET IDEAS, YOU KNOW?

130
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:20,916
- IT CAN'T BE!  THEY'RE
TOGETHER!  THEY'RE A COUPLE!

131
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,958
( wailing )

132
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,958
- UGH!
- HUH?

133
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:29,458
- THE DIMENSIONAL TUNNEL
IS CLOSED.

134
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,958
- SORRY.
WE DON'T WANT ANY.

135
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,416
SO YOU CAN JUST STAY
ON YOUR OWN SIDE.

136
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,958
- GIVE ME SOME MONEY, OLD MAN.

137
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,625
I NEED IT TO BUY A TICKET
FOR THE BULLET TRAIN.

138
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,083
- BUILD ME A TIME MACHINE
AND MAKE IT SNAPPY.

139
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,875
- GIVE ME THE MONEY.
I'M SERIOUS NOW!

140
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,791
- I THINK I'M GONNA START
CRYING.  ( crying )

141
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,583
- DO YOU HAVE TO BE SO LOUD,
GIRLS?

142
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:49,791
- Ryoko: YOU THINK I'M KIDDING?

143
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,750
I'VE GOT TO GET TO
TENCHI TO STOP HIM!

144
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,166
- ( laughs )

145
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,125
- ( loud rumbling )

146
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,916
- ( grunts )

147
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,416
WHAT?!

148
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,333
- ( clamoring )
- Ayeka: WHAT WAS THAT?

149
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,833
- STOP!  GO BACK INSIDE!

150
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,750
- ( screeches )

151
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,541
- YUGI'S NOT COMING,
IS SHE?

152
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,416
WELL, IT WAS JUST A DREAM.

153
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,833
GUESS WE SHOULD GO.
ALL RIGHT.

154
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,083
( gasps )

155
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,583
- Ayeka:
WHATEVER ARE THOSE THINGS?

156
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,083
- Ryoko:
WHERE DID THEY COME FROM?

157
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,541
- I DON'T KNOW.

158
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,791
IT'S BRIGHT AND GLOWING.
LOOK!

159
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,833
- YUGI, YOU'RE HERE.

160
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,416
- I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME,
SASAMI.

161
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,458
- ( meows )

162
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,208
- COME ON, TENCHI.
THIS WAY.  HURRY!

163
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,708
JUST WAIT.  YOU'VE GOT TO SEE
THIS GREAT LITTLE SHOP.

164
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:36,125
- OKAY, SLOW DOWN.
YOU'RE GONNA PULL MY ARM OFF.

165
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,583
- I AM YUGI,

166
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:47,041
THE NEW RULER
OF THIS LOWLY PLANET.

167
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:50,791
HEAR ME NOW, YOU MAGGOTS
OF THE MASAKI FAMILY.

168
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,708
FOR THE NOBLE AND SUPREME CAUSE,

169
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:56,000
SURRENDER YOUR LIVES TO ME.

170
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,291
- WELL, WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S EVIL.

171
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,791
- WHAT DOES SHE MEAN?

172
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,000
- HEY, YUGI,
OR WHOEVER YOU ARE,

173
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,833
YOU NEED A LESSON IN MANNERS.

174
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,541
DIDN'T YOUR MOTHER EVER TEACH
YOU TO BE POLITE

175
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,000
TO BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADIES
LIKE US?

176
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:10,791
- BEAUTY IS IN THE EYE
OF THE DESTROYER.

177
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,416
- ( screaming )

178
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,833
- ( sing-song )
GIRL IS GONNA GET MARRIED.

179
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,333
PUT A VEIL ON HER HEAD

180
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,625
NOT OXEN'S HORNS.

181
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,958
IF THE OXCART FALLS
WITH EVERYTHING IT CARRIES

182
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:26,791
ALL THE WEDDING THINGS
GET RUINED AND TORN

183
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,458
DON'T LET THE GROOM KNOW,
PUT OFF THE WEDDING

184
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,833
SO NOT EVEN THE SUN WILL KNOW--
- OH!

185
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:35,791
- ( wincing )

186
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:39,625
ARE YOU OKAY THERE, YUGI?
- I'M SORRY.

187
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,166
- ( laughs )

188
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,583
- ( meows )

189
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,083
- ( screaming )

190
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,166
- WHAT IS THAT LITTLE THING,
KIYONE?

191
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,458
IT'S SCARING ME.
- YOU DIDN'T STEAL A LOLLIPOP

192
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:59,208
FROM SOME KID WHO TURNED OUT
TO BE A DEMON, DID YOU?

193
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,833
- OF COURSE NOT.
I TOOK SOME KID'S ICE CREAM,

194
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:04,041
BUT THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.
( screaming )

195
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:10,125
- LOOK OUT!  UGH!

196
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:13,916
- KAMIDAKE!
- DO NOT BE ALARMED, PRINCESS.

197
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,083
I WILL DO EVERYTHING
IN MY POWER TO KEEP YOU SAFE.

198
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,791
- THANK YOU.

199
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,125
- SHE'S GOT AMAZING
PSYCHIC STRENGTH.

200
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,500
LORD KATSUHITO.

201
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,458
- I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO STOP IT.

202
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,208
EVEN IF WE COULD COMBINE
OUR POWERS,

203
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,666
I DON'T THINK
IT WILL BE ENOUGH.

204
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,500
IT'S TOO STRONG.
THIS COULD BE IT.

205
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:32,958
- DAMN IT.

206
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,875
- I SEE YOU WANNA PLAY
HIDE AND SEEK,

207
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,125
BUT I PREFER
LIGHTNING TAG.

208
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:42,250
- ( screaming )

209
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,916
- YOU THINK YOU CAN BEAT ME
WITH THOSE LITTLE TRICKS?

210
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,250
HA!  YOU MAKE ME LAUGH.

211
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,541
- A LADDER, TOKYO TOWER

212
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,625
AND HERE'S THE BRIDGE
OF SEPTORU.

213
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,708
YOU JUST GO LIKE THIS
AND THIS,

214
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,541
AND IT'S EASY.  SEE?

215
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:03,041
- ( grunting )

216
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:06,458
- YOU HAVE TO BRING THAT ONE TO
THIS SIDE LIKE THIS.  THAT'S IT.

217
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:13,875
- WHOA, IT WORKED!
- YOU GOT IT.  THAT'S GREAT.

218
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,916
THIS ONE'S FUN.
IT'S CALLED CAT'S CRADLE.

219
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,833
I LEARNED IT FROM GRANDPA.
I BET YOU CAN DO IT, TOO, YUGI.

220
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:25,541
- ARE YOU HAPPY, SASAMI?

221
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,000
- WHAT?
YEAH, I'M REALLY HAPPY.

222
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:31,916
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE,
AND IT'S SO FUN TO BE WITH YOU.

223
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,458
ARE YOU HAPPY, YUGI?

224
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,916
- I BELIEVE I AM.

225
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:41,083
- SAY, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO PICK SOME PRETTY FLOWERS?

226
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,750
- WHY?
- SO WE CAN MAKE A COLORFUL

227
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,833
FLOWER NECKLACE.
- OKAY.

228
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,833
- LET'S GO.  THIS WAY, YUGI.

229
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,791
- ( chittering )

230
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,083
- ( laughing )

231
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,500
- ( groaning )

232
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,250
( screaming )

233
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:08,291
- CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR BRAVERY.

234
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,458
HERE'S YOUR REWARD!

235
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,833
- ( gasping )
- OH!

236
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,666
- ( explosion )

237
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:23,125
- OH!
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, TENCHI?

238
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,208
- UM, NOTHING, I GUESS.

239
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,125
NOW YOU WERE TELLING ME
WHAT HAPPENED

240
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,916
TO YOSHINAGA AND SUGANO.

241
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,250
- YEAH, WELL, THEY KEPT
ASKING IF I LIKE YOU, TENCHI.

242
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,666
I SAID, "HOW CAN YOU TELL?"
AND THEY'RE ALL,

243
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,875
"IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS."
KIND OF ANNOYING, ISN'T IT?

244
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,916
I GUESS I BETTER TRY
TO BE MORE SUBTLE ABOUT IT.

245
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,625
YOU PROBABLY DON'T LIKE IT.
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

246
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,541
- NO, I DON'T MIND.  YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY 'CAUSE OF THAT.

247
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:46,583
IT'S OKAY.

248
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,000
- OH!

249
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:51,583
- ( panting )
- ( groaning )

250
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,500
- ( whimpers )

251
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:57,500
- Yugi: HA!  PRETTY PATHETIC.

252
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,291
ONCE YOU LOSE UNITY,
YOU BECOME SO VULNERABLE.

253
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,833
IN FACT, YOU'RE HARDLY
EVEN WORTH THE EFFORT.

254
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,250
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

255
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:08,833
I CAN'T LOSE THIS EASILY,
NOT NOW TO THAT LITTLE RUNT!

256
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,625
- IT'S ALL OVER.

257
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,041
- OH, TENCHI.

258
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,083
- HUH?

259
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,291
- WHAT'S THAT, TENCHI?

260
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,250
- ( gasps )

261
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,750
- OH.

262
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,500
WOW.

263
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,458
- OH, TENCHI.

264
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,416
- ARE YOU THERE, LORD TENCHI?

265
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,375
- ( whimpering )

266
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,375
- WHAT IN THE WORLD?

267
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,291
- LORD TENCHI.

268
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:57,166
- TENCHI, PLEASE.

269
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,833
- NO, HE CAN'T HAVE THAT MUCH
POWER LEFT.

270
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:09,958
( gasps )

271
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,958
- NO, YUGI!

272
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,916
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

273
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,375
- ( whimpering )

274
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:20,333
- I'M HERE, YUGI.
WAKE UP, PLEASE.

275
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:24,291
- I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
THANKS, SASAMI.

276
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:28,291
- YUGI, WHAT'S HAPPENING
TO YOU?

277
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,500
- I STAYED ON THIS SIDE OF THE
WORLD JUST A LITTLE TOO LONG.

278
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,291
( groans )

279
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,208
- YOU LITTLE TWERP.

280
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:39,250
I AM RYOKO!

281
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,541
AND I AM NOT ONE
TO BE TRIFLED WITH.

282
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:42,500
- ( gasps )

283
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,250
- ( gasps )

284
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:57,083
DAMN.  NOT AGAIN.

285
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,125
- NICE TRY,
BUT NOW YOU'RE FINISHED, RYOKO.

286
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,500
- ( growls )

287
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,125
- ( gasps )

288
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,791
- IT'S YOU.

289
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:22,500
- YOU'RE VERY BRAVE, RYOKO,
AND DASHING.

290
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,500
- NOT DASHING.  NO, THAT'S
SOMETHING YOU SAY TO A MALE.

291
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,375
- YOUR REINFORCEMENTS
HAVE ARRIVED.

292
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,958
THAT'S A TWIST.

293
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,333
SO BE IT.

294
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:36,416
YOUR EXECUTION
IS TEMPORARILY POSTPONED.

295
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,375
( laughing )

296
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,166
- RYOKO.

297
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,375
- HUH?
- SEE YOU LATER.

298
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,083
- IT'S BEEN FUN.

299
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,583
- WHO ARE THEY?
AND WHAT IS ALL OF THIS ABOUT?

300
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,541
- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I WANT TO KNOW.

301
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,791
- YEAH, SO DO WE ALL.
I CAN ONLY SAY

302
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,916
THERE IS A GIANT NET
OF CONSPIRACY

303
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,541
THAT IS CLOSING IN AROUND US.
- Ayeka: CONSPIRACY?

304
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,416
- YUGI.

305
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,291
WHERE ARE YOU?

306
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,541
- OH!  I GET IT.

307
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:44,291
RYO-OHKI, IT WAS JUST A DREAM.
RYO-OHKI.

308
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,666
- ( yawns )

309
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,958
- COME ON, RYO-OHKI.
LET'S GO HOME.

310
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:54,958
- ( meows )

311
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,291
- ( dialing telephone )

312
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,250
- ( ringing )

313
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,875
- EXCUSE ME,
BUT YOUR PHONE IS RINGING.

314
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:19,791
- ( groaning )
- MY BODY HURTS ALL OVER.

315
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,250
CHILL!

316
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,458
- UGH!

317
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:26,375
WHAT WAS THAT?

318
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,750
- ( panting )

319
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,458
- I MIGHT HAVE RETREATED
A BIT TOO SOON.

320
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,666
THEY'RE NOT QUITE AS EASY
AS I THOUGHT THEY WERE.

321
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,333
- THAT'S BECAUSE YOU TAKE RISKS.

322
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,083
I'M SURE YOU'D HAVE WON
IF YOU HADN'T

323
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,791
SPLIT YOURSELF
INTO TWO PARTS, YUGI.

324
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,916
- PERHAPS, BUT I DIDN'T WANT
HER TO SEE THE CARNAGE.

325
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,541
SASAMI'S MY FRIEND,
YOU SEE.

326
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:07,291
- WELL, AT LEAST HOTSUMA
AND TSUGARU WON THEIR TRUST.

327
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,916
SO IT'S NOT A COMPLETE LOSS.

328
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,666
- YES, WE'LL GO SLOW.

329
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:26,375
I HAD A GREAT TIME
WITH YOU, SASAMI.

330
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,333
REALLY.

331
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,666
- ( theme music playing )

332
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

333
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:06,541
- ( meowing )

334
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,625
- I'M AYEKA.  SO THE DIMENSIONAL
TUNNEL IS BLOCKED,

335
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:17,500
AND THERE'S MONEY IN THE HOUSE
TO BUY THE TRAIN TICKETS.

336
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:20,416
BUT NOTHING CAN STOP ME
FROM TRYING TO SEE LORD TENCHI.

337
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,416
I'LL WALK ALL THE WAY
TO TOKYO IF I HAVE TO.

338
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,375
I KNOW ALL THE PURE-HEARTED
MAIDENS WHO LOOK FOR LOVE

339
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:27,250
AND BELIEVE IN LOVE
SHARE MY FEELINGS.

340
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:30,125
WHAT?  YOU'LL GIVE ME
A FREE RIDE TO TOKYO?

341
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,750
OH, THANK YOU, MISS MASAYO.

342
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:35,625
LET US GO HAND IN HAND
AFTER THE MEN WE LOVE.

343
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:38,166
