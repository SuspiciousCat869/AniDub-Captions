1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,916
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,625
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,708
- ( horns honking )

4
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,416
- ( sighs )

5
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,083
- ( ringing )

6
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,083
- WAH!

7
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:32,833
- ( groans )

8
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:33,791
( growls )

9
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,375
IT'S WASHU. WHO MAY I
ASK IS CALLING, PLEASE?

10
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,083
WHAT A SURPRISE, TENCHI.

11
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,708
- SORRY TO BOTHER YOU
SO LATE AT NIGHT.

12
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,916
I'M CALLING TO ASK
FOR A FAVOR.

13
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,708
- OH, I'M FLATTERED.
WHAT A NAUGHTY BOY YOU ARE.

14
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,875
I know how lonely it
must be there in Tokyo.

15
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:56,250
Sleeping in your little room.
I can be there in a few minutes.

16
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,291
But I do have to clean up first.

17
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,625
- NO, PLEASE, WAIT!

18
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,583
IT'S ABOUT
THE DIMENSIONAL TUNNEL.

19
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,416
I'M CALLING TO ASK
IF YOU WOULD REMOVE IT.

20
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,750
- HMM?  WHY DO YOU SUDDENLY
WANT ME TO TAKE IT OUT?

21
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,750
- IT'S OBVIOUS, ISN'T IT?
I'M A BACHELOR LIVING ON MY OWN.

22
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,250
PEOPLE WILL TALK IF GIRLS
KEEP POPPING OUT OF NOWHERE

23
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,541
MORNING, NOON AND NIGHT.

24
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:15,750
- I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT.

25
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,666
I'LL TAKE IT OUT,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

26
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,750
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
IS IT A LOT OF TROUBLE?

27
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:23,291
- NOT REALLY. IN FACT, IT'LL BE
GONE BY THE TIME YOU WAKE UP.

28
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,291
- I APPRECIATE IT.
GOOD NIGHT.

29
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,958
- HMM...

30
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,458
- ( alarm beeping )

31
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,750
- HMM?
- ( sighs )

32
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,416
- ( meows )
- HUH?

33
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,833
- OH...
- ( snoring )

34
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,500
- ( chopping )

35
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:47,583
- ( sizzling )

36
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,375
- ( yawning )

37
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,125
- ( giggles )

38
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,583
- ( snoring )

39
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,958
- OKAY, EVERYONE, I'M PACKED.
ARE YOU READY TO GO?

40
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,625
- MISO SOUP, HOT IN THE POT!

41
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,750
- PICKLES AND SALMON,
I'M READY FOR JAMMIN'!

42
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,666
- LET'S MOVE,
I'M IN THE GROOVE!

43
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,500
- MEOW MEOW MEOW!

44
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,291
- DIMENSIONAL TUNNEL'S
IN PLACE.

45
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,291
LET'S GO VISIT TENCHI
IN TOKYO.

46
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,291
- All: YEAH!

47
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,750
- ( all cheer )

48
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,541
- ( all groan )

49
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,583
- OW!
- IT HURTS!

50
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,916
- WHO PUT THAT CEILING UP THERE?

51
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,833
- I THINK SOMETHING'S WRONG
WITH THE TUNNEL.

52
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:32,833
- WHAT?

53
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,833
- All: OHH...

54
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,291
- MISS WASHU?

55
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,791
- WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY!

56
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,083
SOMEONE BROKE THE TUNNEL!

57
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,541
- NO, SASAMI, I SHUT IT DOWN.

58
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,333
- ( both gasp )
- I BEG YOUR PARDON?

59
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,041
- WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO MEAN TO US?

60
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,791
IS IT BECAUSE I ATE THAT LAST
PIECE OF BLUEBERRY CHEESECAKE

61
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,833
YOU HAD HIDDEN IN
THE BACK OF THE REFRIGERATOR?

62
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,250
OR IS IT BECAUSE I PUT ON
THAT NURSE'S UNIFORM

63
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,291
YOU LIKE TO WEAR
AND RIPPED THE PANTS LAST WEEK

64
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,958
WHEN YOU WERE OUT OF THE HOUSE?
- HUH?

65
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,125
- OR IS IT 'CAUSE
I ACCIDENTLY POURED TEQUILA

66
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,500
ON YOUR COMPUTER
AND IT GOT DRUNK,

67
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,041
AND THREW UP SQUARE ROOTS?

68
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,375
YOU DID THAT?

69
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,375
YOU CLOSED THE TUNNEL
FOR SUCH TRIVIAL REASONS?

70
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,791
- OH, PUT A LID ON IT.

71
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,625
LOOK, IF YOU MUST KNOW,
TENCHI CALLED ME LAST NIGHT

72
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,375
AND ASKED ME IF I'D PLEASE
REMOVE IT.

73
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:20,541
- YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN.

74
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,541
- HE WAS PROBABLY JOKING.

75
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,125
- HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN SERIOUS.

76
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:27,166
THE TUNNEL IS THE BOND THAT
CONNECTS US TO HIM IN TOKYO.

77
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,041
- ( stomach grumbles loudly )

78
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,291
- SORRY, EVERYONE!

79
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,000
I GUESS I'M HUNGRIER
THAN I REALIZED.

80
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,500
- WE'RE HAVING
AN EMERGENCY HERE.

81
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:35,708
PUT YOUR STOMACH ON HOLD.

82
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,208
OH, WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHY IN THE WORLD

83
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,125
TENCHI WON'T LET US BRING HIM
HIS BREAKFAST.

84
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,791
( gasps ) GOOD HEAVENS!
HE COULD BE SICK,

85
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,541
AND DESPERATELY NEED OUR HELP!

86
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,000
WE HAVE TO GET TO TENCHI'S ROOM
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

87
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,333
IT'S LIFE AND DEATH!

88
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,500
PUT THE DIMENSIONAL TUNNEL
BACK IN PLACE RIGHT NOW!

89
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,666
- THERE IS NO PROBLEM.
HE'S NOT SICK.

90
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,625
- WOULD YOU LIKE A CUP OF TEA?

91
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:05,625
- THANKS.

92
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,000
OOH.

93
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,041
- WHAT'S UP?

94
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,958
- I WAS THINKING HOW
PLEASANT IT IS TO FINALLY

95
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,500
HAVE A QUIET MEAL.

96
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:21,041
- UH...

97
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,250
- YEAH, WHAT IS IT?

98
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,333
- HUH?  MM-MM.

99
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,875
I SPACED OUT.
- HEY!  TENCHI!

100
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,291
ARE YOU READY?
WE HAVE TO GET TO SCHOOL, RIGHT?

101
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,125
( giggles )

102
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,791
- OH, NO, I DIDN'T SEE
WHAT TIME IT WAS.

103
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,625
- SAKUYA, I HAVE TO GO.

104
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:36,875
- UH...

105
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,833
MM.

106
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,791
- ( snoring )

107
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,791
( mumbles )
TENCHI...

108
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,833
LET ME RUB YOUR FEET.

109
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,458
- ( clears throat )

110
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:53,083
- I FIGURE, IF WE WANT
TO KNOW THE TRUTH,

111
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,458
WE'LL HAVE TO GO ASK TENCHI.

112
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,916
- GEE, HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT?

113
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,916
- WITH THE TUNNEL DOWN,
WE'LL HAVE TO BUY A TICKET

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,291
AND GO TO TOKYO.

115
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,208
- PLEASE, WE'RE ALREADY
IN THE RED THIS MONTH.

116
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,000
THERE'S NO EXTRA MONEY
FOR THAT.

117
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,333
- I FIGURED AS MUCH.

118
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,375
I THINK THE PERSON WHO'S
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS MESS

119
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:10,000
SHOULD STEP FORWARD
AND PAY OUR WAY.

120
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,666
- EH?  NOW WAIT JUST A MINUTE.
IT'S MY FAULT?

121
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,958
- OF COURSE IT IS.

122
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,708
IF YOU AREN'T RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS SITUATION,

123
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,458
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
WHO IS.

124
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:20,416
- I WAS SIMPLY TRYING TO DO
THE THING THAT WAS BEST FOR HIM.

125
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,916
- REALLY?!  WELL, IT'S OBVIOUS
YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN A THOUGHT

126
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,333
TO WHAT'D BE BEST FOR US.

127
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,250
- UH.  WELL, NO,
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS SAYING.

128
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:30,083
- THEN YOU SHOULD GIVE US
THE MONEY TO TRAVEL TO TOKYO.

129
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,750
- ( meows angrily )

130
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,833
- ( all sobbing )

131
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,083
- ( chuckles nervously )
I WOULD IF I COULD,

132
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,708
BUT I CAN'T REALLY AFFORD TO
ON MY TINY SALARY.

133
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,791
- I DON'T THINK
THAT'S QUITE TRUE.

134
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:40,750
- ( gasps )

135
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:48,416
- HERE!
LET ME DEMONSTRATE.

136
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,708
OKAY, THIS BLOCK REPRESENTS

137
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,708
THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF
FATHER'S MONTHLY SALARY.

138
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:56,500
FROM THAT, WE TAKE AWAY TAXES
AND BASIC LIVING EXPENSES.

139
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:59,333
THEN FROM THE BALANCE OF THAT,
WE TAKE AWAY THE COST OF DRINKS,

140
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,583
CIGARETTES AND THE NEWSPAPER
HE READS EVERY DAY.

141
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,541
THEN WE TAKE AWAY
ALL HIS COMIC BOOKS

142
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,458
AND ALL THE CANDY
BARS HE HAS HIDDEN

143
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,041
IN EVERY SINGLE ROOM
OF THE HOUSE...

144
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,375
AND THAT'S WHAT'S LEFT.

145
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,958
- Both: HMM?

146
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,375
- THEN, YOU MULTIPLY
THIS FIGURE BY 12,

147
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,583
AND THEN YOU MULTIPLY IT
AGAIN BY THE NUMBER OF YEARS

148
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:15,791
HE'S BEEN EARNING HIS SALARY.

149
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,791
- OH.  YEAH.

150
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,750
- THAT'S THE AMOUNT HE'S SAVED
ALL THESE YEARS.

151
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,375
AND IT'S ENOUGH TO SEND
FIVE ADULTS,

152
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,583
ONE CHILD AND ONE PET ON
A ROUND-TRIP BUS RIDE TO TOKYO.

153
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,208
WITH ENOUGH LEFT OVER FOR
SOME BOXED LUNCHES AND SNACKS.

154
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,500
PLUS A LITTLE SPENDING MONEY!

155
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,250
NOW, ANY QUESTIONS?

156
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,541
- ( giggles )

157
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,083
I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
IT'S LOGICAL.

158
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,750
- I KNEW HE HAD THE MONEY
TO PAY FOR THIS TRIP ALL ALONG.

159
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,916
- WELL, WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?
LET'S SEARCH THE HOUSE.

160
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,083
- GOOD!  WE CAN GO SEE
TENCHI AFTER ALL.

161
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,583
- ( meowing )
- THANK GOODNESS

162
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,916
YOU FIGURED IT OUT, WASHU.
I WAS GETTING DISAPPOINTED.

163
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,625
- ( sobbing )
THERE GOES MY SECRET SAVINGS!

164
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,625

165
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,666
- ( indistinct chatter )

166
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,708
- HEY, TENCHI, DID

PRO WRESTLING MATCH YESTERDAY?

168
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,166
SADAKO WAS WILD!
- SAKUYA!

169
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,958
GOOD MORNING.
- HI. NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO

170
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,583
IS BUY SOME
INGREDIENTS, RIGHT?

171
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,083
- THAT'S RIGHT.  HMM?

172
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,083
NOW I HEARD
THAT YOU GOT SAKUYA

173
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,000
TO PACK YOU A LUNCH TODAY,
TENCHI.

174
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,916
- MAYBE I DID.
- WELL?

175
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,250
- WELL, WHAT?
- OH...

176
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,750
COME ON!
- AAH!

177
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,958
- WELL, DID YOU FINALLY TELL HER
YOU WERE IN LOVE WITH HER?

178
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,625
- WHAT?  NO WAY.

179
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,833
- OHH.  I SUPPOSE
THERE'S STILL TIME TOMORROW.

180
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,500
- ARE YOU NUTS? TOMORROW'S THE
DAY OF THE SCHOOL FESTIVAL.

181
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,833
- I KNOW THAT!
I DON'T MEAN DURING IT, SILLY.

182
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,291
YOU KNOW THE LEGEND--

183
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,625
ANYONE WHO DECLARES THEIR LOVE

184
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,125
AT THE PARTY
FOLLOWING THE FESTIVAL

185
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,458
CAN EXPECT TO LIVE
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

186
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,166
- OH.
- Sakuya: IS THAT TRUE?

187
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,291
- YOU BET.

188
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,458
- ANYTIME DURING THE PARTY.
- MM-HMM.

189
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:41,666
- TENCHI...
- AAH!

190
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,708
- ...WHY DON'T YOU COME
WITH ME AFTER SCHOOL

191
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,791
TO WATCH THE GIRLS'
WRESTLING TEAM?

192
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,708
THEY'RE HAVING
A MAJOR PRACTICE TODAY.

193
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,500
- ( laughs )

194
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,416
VERY SOON...

195
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,416
THE TWO STARS WILL OVERLAP.

196
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,375
THEN IT WILL BE TIME.

197
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,583
- HMM?  WHAT'S THE MATTER?

198
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,666
- WHAT?  NOTHING.

199
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,625
- ( Sugano's voice )  ANYONE WHO
DECLARES THEIR LOVE AT THE PARTY

200
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,791
FOLLOWING THE FESTIVAL,

201
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,333
CAN EXPECT TO LIVE
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

202
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,791
- MAKE SURE THAT MAT IS TIGHT.

203
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,791
- OKAY!

204
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,250
- TIE IT OFF IN THE CORNER!

205
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,250
- GIVE ME SOME SLACK.

206
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,958
- OH, YUCK,
LOOK AT THIS DIRTY OLD THING.

207
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,000
- IT MUST HAVE BELONGED
TO SOMEONE WHO GRADUATED.

208
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,166
- JUST THROW IT AWAY.

209
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,041
- I THINK WE SHOULD BURN IT.

210
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,541
- I BROUGHT THE CREPE COOKER.

211
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,000
- THANKS.
WE'RE REALLY GONNA NEED IT.

212
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,583
- CAN YOU DO US A FAVOR, PLEASE,
AND SET IT UP FOR US?

213
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,583
- OH, YEAH, SURE.
- I CAN HELP.

214
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,416
- OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.
I HAVE A MEETING WITH

215
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,916
THE MEMBERS OF THE
FESTIVAL COMMITTEE.

216
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,250
I'LL BE GONE FOR AWHILE.
- DON'T WORRY, WE'LL BE FINE.

217
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,666
- Both: HMM?  OH!

218
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,375
- I'M GOING TO FIND
SOMETHING TO EAT.

219
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,625
MY STOMACH JUST REMINDED
ME I'VE BEEN IGNORING IT

220
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,583
ALL MORNING.
- I'M GONNA TAKE A QUICK BREAK,

221
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:01,166
AND SEE IF I CAN FIND
SOME MASKING TAPE.

222
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,750
- WE'LL BE HERE
WHEN YOU GET BACK.

223
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,416
- UH, YOU HAVE A SCREWDRIVER?

224
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,083
- OH, SURE.

225
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,875
- WHAT A COWARD. WE'RE GIVING
HIM EVERY OPPORTUNITY.

226
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,541
- GO FOR IT.
COME ON, TENCHI.

227
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,250
- I THINK HE NEEDS A KICK
IN THE PANTS TO GET MOVING.

228
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,958
I MIGHT NEED SOME
HELP WITH THIS.

229
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,166
ALL RIGHT.

230
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,791
I THINK WE'RE GONNA SEE
SOME SPARKS, GIRLS.

231
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:22,375
( all gasp )

232
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:23,500
- TENCHI!

233
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,000
WHY ARE YOU WASTING
YOUR TIME HERE?

234
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,291
LET'S WATCH THE FEMALE
WRESTLING TEAM WORK OUT.

235
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,250
- All:
HE'S MESSING UP EVERYTHING.

236
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:33,208
- ( silently )

237
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,666
- HE'S CERTAINLY
MESSING UP MY PLANS.

238
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,541
TIME FOR A DISTRACTION.

239
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,833
OFF YOU GO.

240
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:49,375
- HIYAH!  HIYAH!  HIYAH!  HA!

241
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,750
HA!  HIYAH!

242
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,291
- EVERYBODY'S TOO BUSY
TO GO WITH ME TO THE PRACTICE.

243
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,708
- I NEED THAT NUT.
- HUH?

244
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,041
- UH... OH!

245
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,458
- ALLOW ME.
I'M AVAILABLE IF YOU NEED HELP.

246
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,583
- ( bell rings )
- AAH!

247
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,250
HUH?

248
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,333
HUH?  WHOA!

249
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,333
- GERMAN SUPLEX!

250
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:10,333
- WHOA!

251
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,125

252
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,416

253
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:17,833
- ( squeaks )

254
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,666
- ( squeaks )

255
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,291
- WHOA!

256
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,291
THIS FEELS GREAT.

257
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,000
MY GOODNESS, IT'S ALMOST
LIKE I'M FLYING.

258
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:37,208
- ( yawns )

259
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:40,000
- I GUESS I MUST HAVE
OVERSLEPT A LITTLE.

260
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,458
WHAT'S HAPPENED DOWN THERE?!

261
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:46,458
- ( muffled groaning )

262
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,708
- SPEAK UP, I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

263
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:48,916
- ( muffled speech )

264
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,833
- IT WAS A GANG OF ROBBERS,
WASN'T IT?

265
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,208
- UH, WELL, NO, I WOULDN'T
SAY THAT EXACTLY.

266
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,916
- I CAN'T FIND A SIGN
OF IT ANYWHERE.

267
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
- ME EITHER, AND I CHECKED
EVERY ROOM IN THE HOUSE.

268
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,166
- MAYBE THERE'S A HIDDEN SAFE
IN THE WALL.

269
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,833
RYOKO, I SEE YOU
FINALLY WOKE UP.

270
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,125
- WHAT ARE BUMBLE BRAINS UP TO?

271
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,500
SO, YOU'VE BEEN SEARCHING
FOR HIS SECRET STASH, HUH?

272
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:10,916
- THAT'S RIGHT, AND NOW
THAT YOU'RE AWAKE,

273
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,833
YOU CAN SEARCH WITH US.

274
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,458
WE CAN USE THE EXTRA HELP.

275
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,958
- I'M NOT GONNA HELP YOU.
- WHY NOT?

276
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,625
- BECAUSE I'M BONDED
TO TENCHI BY TRUE LOVE

277
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,708
NO MATTER WHAT
THE DISTANCE.

278
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,291
AND ANYWAY, I CAN FLY THERE
WHENEVER I WANT.

279
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,291
- RYOKO, YOU CHEATER!

280
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,625
I WON'T LET HER
GET AWAY WITH THIS.

281
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:31,000
FINE.  WE DON'T NEED HER.
WE'LL FIND THE MONEY ON OUR OWN.

282
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:34,041
- AAH!  I'M GONNA BE ROBBED!
HELP!

283
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,208
- WE'RE BACK.
- WE'RE ALL DONE.

284
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,583
- I SET UP THE CREPE COOKER.
IT'S READY TO GO.

285
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,416
- THANK YOU.
- PERFECT.

286
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,291
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS
LOAD UP THE SUPPLIES

287
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,416
FOR TOMORROW.
- SAKUYA, CAN YOU BUY

288
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,166
THE INGREDIENTS WE'LL
NEED TO MAKE THE CREPES?

289
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,500
- SURE, NO PROBLEM.
- YOU'LL NEED SOME HELP.

290
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,333
TENCHI, CAN YOU GO ALONG
AND GIVE HER A HAND

291
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,708
BRINGING EVERYTHING BACK?

292
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,208
- NO PROBLEM.
I'LL BE GLAD TO.

293
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,208
- THANKS.

294
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,666
- Girls:
HAVE A NICE TIME!

295
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,208
- IS THAT BAG
TOO HEAVY FOR YOU?

296
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,125
- NO, I'M OKAY.

297
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,208
IT'S SO WEIRD.
- WHAT?

298
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,166
- THE GIRLS, HAVEN'T THEY
BEEN ACTING STRANGE?

299
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,416
- NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,

300
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,750
IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'VE BEEN
DOING EVERYTHING

301
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,291
THEY CAN COME UP WITH
JUST TO MAKE SURE

302
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,375
YOU AND I END UP ALONE.

303
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,208
- EXACTLY WHAT
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

304
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,541
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

305
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,833
THE FACT IS, I KINDA LIKE
BEING ALONE WITH YOU.

306
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,416
- HEY!  TENCHI!
- HUH?

307
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,750
- HI!

308
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:23,916
- MM?

309
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,583
- ( bell rings )
- AAH.  NOT AGAIN.

310
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,416
- AX BOMBER!

311
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,458
- WH-- WHY ME?!

312
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,458
- UH-- I- HUH?

313
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,125
- ( girls sighing, groaning )

314
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,625
- I GUESS THE MONEY'S HIDDEN
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

315
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,333
- I DON'T CARE ANYMORE.
I'M TRIED OF LOOKING FOR IT.

316
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,416
- ( weakly )
MEOW MEOW MEOW.

317
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,833
- I'M TIRED TOO.
I THINK IT'S TIME TO GIVE UP.

318
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,625
- WE CAN'T BE DEFEATED
LIKE THIS!

319
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,208
AFTER ALL, WE'RE GALAXY
POLICE DETECTIVES.

320
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,791
- WHAT HAPPENED TO WASHU?
SHE JUST DISAPPEARED.

321
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,375
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

322
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,875
- SHE HASN'T BEEN AROUND
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS.

323
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,791
- I'M HERE.
- ( gasps )

324
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,541
- WHAT?!  GOOD HEAVENS.

325
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,041
- HUH?
- OH.

326
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,375
- HUH?
- AAH.

327
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,541
- MISS WASHU,
WHAT IS THAT THING?

328
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,791
- MEOW MEOW MEOW.
- GLAD YOU ASKED.

329
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,291
THIS, MY FRIENDS,
IS AN AUTOMATIC SELF-PROPELLED

330
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,250
TREASURE-FINDING CANINE ROBOT.
I CALL HIM FIDO.

331
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,291
- ( barks )

332
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,291
- HE'S SO CUTE!
- YEAH, REAL CUTE.

333
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,208
- I'VE PROGRAMMED HIM
WITH SPECIAL ABILITIES

334
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,625
SO HE CAN FIND ANY KIND OF
TREASURE HIDDEN BY ANYONE,

335
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:32,833
ANYWHERE.

336
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,791
THE MONEY WILL BE OURS
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

337
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,125
- ( girls cheering )

338
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,708
- ( howls )
- Girls: AWW!

339
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,666
- HE LOOKS LIKE A MUTT.

340
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,500
- WELL, WE'VE GOT ALL
THE GROCERIES WE NEED.

341
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:46,916
- THAT'S GREAT.

342
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,583
YOUR NEXT ASSIGNMENT
IS TO TAKE THE STACK OF POSTERS

343
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,166
AND PUT THEM UP ON THE CAMPUS.
- OKAY.

344
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,791
- TENCHI, CAN YOU HELP HER OUT?
THEY'RE PRETTY HEAVY.

345
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,500
- OH, SURE.
- WAIT.

346
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:57,833
BEFORE YOU DO THAT,

347
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,583
YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE ROOF
AND HANG THESE BANNERS.

348
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,041
- Girls:
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

349
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,875
- DID YOU MAKE SURE
THE ROOF WAS CLEAR,

350
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,541
SO THEY'LL BE ALONE?
- YES, MA'AM.

351
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,375
THEY SHOULD HAVE THE
ROOF TO THEMSELVES

352
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,875
FOR AT LEAST A HALF-HOUR.

353
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,208
- IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.
I HOPE HE DOESN'T BLOW IT.

354
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,625
- COME ON, TENCHI, GO!

355
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,833
- DARN, I WONDER WHERE FATHER
COULD HAVE HIDDEN THAT MONEY.

356
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:17,833
OH, MY.

357
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:18,958
- ( cash register dings )

358
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,375
- WOW!  WHAT A LUCKY BREAK!

359
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,875
I CAN BUY AT LEAST SEVEN
SEAWEED SNACKS WITH THIS.

360
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,208
- WOOF!
- HUH?!

361
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,916
HI...

362
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,458
- ( barks )

363
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,416
- ( laughs )

364
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,583
COME HERE, FIDO.

365
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,250
LET ME HAVE A LITTLE
TALK WITH YOU.

366
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,416
- I HAVE NEVER BEEN BEATEN
BY ANYONE.

367
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,083
BUT I WISH I COULD MEET
A WRESTLER

368
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,083
WHO WOULD CHALLENGE ME
AS AN EQUAL.

369
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,875
IN ALL MY ENCOUNTERS,
I HAVE FOLLOWED THE CODE

370
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,375
OF A TRUE PROFESSIONAL.

371
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:51,250
I HAVE GIVEN NO MERCY,
AND I HAVE EXPECTED NONE

372
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,625
FROM MY OPPONENTS.

373
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:57,166
NOW, WHAT IS LEFT TO FIRE
MY COMPETITIVE SPIRIT?

374
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,125
- ( gasps )

375
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,083
- TENCHI, WHERE ARE YOU HIDING?

376
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,416
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT MAN
IS ABLE TO WALK AROUND

377
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,541
AFTER I PUT MY BEST MOVES
ON HIM.

378
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:11,958
COULD HE BE THE ONE WHO
REKINDLES MY COMPETITIVE FIRE?

379
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:14,916
- SOMETHING IS GOING ON.

380
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,250
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS,
BUT MY BLOOD IS BOILING.

381
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,416
IT'S WEIRD!
I COULD FEEL IT TAKING OVER,

382
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,250
TURNING ME INTO AN ANIMAL!

383
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,416
I BETTER GO
AND TELL TENCHI.

384
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,625
TENCHI!
- ( bell rings )

385
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,583
- ELBOW CRASH!

386
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,583
- ( screams )

387
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,875
I KNOW YOU'RE IN HERE, TENCHI.
HELLO?

388
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:34,875
- ( bell rings )

389
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,833
- BRAIN BUSTER!

390
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,000
- WHOA!

391
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,625
TENCHI, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

392
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:41,625
- ( bell rings )

393
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:44,625
- FLYING CROSS TOP!

394
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,500
- WAH-HA!

395
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,916
( weakly )
HELLO, TENCHI?

396
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,250
- ( bell rings )
- ( moans )

397
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,708
- GIANT SWING!

398
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,875
- NOT AGAIN!

399
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,333
- ( bird squawking )

400
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,250
- ( sighing, groaning )

401
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,625
( chuckles )

402
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,666
I'M FIGHTING AN INVISIBLE ENEMY,
BUT I'M READY FOR HIM.

403
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,666
MY SENSES ARE REALLY TINGLING.

404
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,916
I NEVER FELT SO ALIVE.
( laughs maniacally )

405
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,583
WHOEVER YOU ARE,
I'M READY FOR YOU!

406
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,833
WATCH THIS, TENCHI!

407
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,125
- ( bell rings )

408
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,375
- I KNEW YOU WOULD COME!

409
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,958
IT'S THE FINAL SHOWDOWN.

410
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,791
- AAH!

411
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:38,833
( grunts )

412
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,750
- DROP KICK!

413
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,916
- ( grunts )

414
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,875
( groans )

415
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,750
- GET UP AND FIGHT,
AMAGASAKI!

416
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,750
- I'M GETTING BEAT UP HERE,
TENCHI.

417
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,125
- GET UP, AMAGASAKI,
GET UP.

418
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:57,083
- IT ALMOST SOUNDS
LIKE THEY'RE CHEERING FOR ME.

419
00:18:57,166 --> 00:19:00,083
- ( crowd cheering )

420
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,916
- SHOW 'EM WHAT YOU'RE
MADE OF, BUDDY!

421
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,083
- ( groans loudly )

422
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,458
( panting )

423
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,458
- YAH!

424
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,041
- MM.

425
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,083
- HA!

426
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,375
- WHOA!
( grunts )

427
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,708
( screaming )

428
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,125
- WAH!

429
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,625
- ( groans )

430
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,250
- OH!

431
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,125
( thinking)
HE SIZED UP MY ATTACK.

432
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,916
AND CAME BACK
WITH ONE OF HIS OWN.

433
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,666
- GOTCHA!

434
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,208
- ( chuckles )

435
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,916
( groaning )

436
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
- IT'S OVER NOW.
YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT DEFEAT.

437
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:44,166
- YOU MAY CALL IT A DEFEAT,
BUT I CALL IT A VICTORY.

438
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,666
- HUH?
- MM.

439
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,250
- AAH!  WHOA!

440
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,166
- HUH?  AAH!
- AAH!

441
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,791
- ( both grunt )

442
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:54,791
- ( gasp )

443
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,333
- ( groans loudly )

444
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:05,333
WHOA!

445
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,416
- YAH!

446
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,750
DON'T JUMP
TO CONCLUSIONS NOW.

447
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:08,750
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

448
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,500
- ( laughs )
I SAW NOTHING.

449
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,916
YOUR SECRET'S SAFE WITH ME.

450
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,250
I MEAN, IT WAS JUST
A LITTLE KISS, WASN'T IT?

451
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,541
DON'T YOU WORRY.
I DON'T PLAN TO TELL ANYBODY.

452
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,750
I SWEAR.
I'M A SENSITIVE GUY.

453
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,500
- AMAGASAKI!

454
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,166
YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG.

455
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:28,500
- HUH?

456
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,041
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE!

457
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,291
THERE'S NO MISTAKE.

458
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,208
THIS IS THE MASK
OF THE FAMOUS FEMALE WRESTLER,

459
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,750
IKARINU SADAKO.

460
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,583
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN
MY OPPONENT ALL ALONG,

461
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:40,875
AND I DEFEATED HER.

462
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,833
ALL RIGHT!

463
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,458
- PRINCESS, HAVE YOU
BY CHANCE

464
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,375
FOUND MY SECRET
SAVINGS YET?

465
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,208
- SO FAR WE'VE HAD NO LUCK.
- OH, GOOD ANSWER.

466
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,375
THAT'S JUST FINE.

467
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:00,083
- ( chuckles )

468
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,083
( laughs )

469
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:05,458
- ( classical music playing )

470
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:13,916
- TOMORROW.

471
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,666
- ANYONE WHO DECLARES
THEIR LOVE AT THE PARTY

472
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,791
FOLLOWING THE FESTIVAL

473
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:29,500
CAN EXPECT TO LIVE
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

474
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,000
