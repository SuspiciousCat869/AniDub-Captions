1
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:34,583
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:04,625
- IT'S AMAZING!
I'VE BEEN SO INCREDIBLY DENSE.

3
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:05,875
( laughs )

4
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,250
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

5
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,250
HOW TO CLOSE UP THE DIMENSIONAL
TUNNEL FOR SO LONG,

6
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,375
AND NOW I KNOW.

7
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,375
- ( birds chirping )

8
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:18,833
- ( giggles )

9
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,458
IF I'M VERY QUIET, I CAN SNEAK
THROUGH THE DIMENSIONAL TUNNEL

10
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:24,625
TO SEE TENCHI.

11
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:27,250
- I JUST HAVE TO FOLD
THIS COMFORTER,

12
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,875
AND THE TUNNEL
IS CLOSED.

13
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,458
I'LL HAVE
SOME PEACE!

14
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,708
- ( music playing )
- NO MORE CHAOS AND HAVOC

15
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,791
AND NOISE AND UNPREDICTABLE
MOOD SWINGS.

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,583
I'LL GO BACK TO BEING
JUST A KID,

17
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,333
HAPPY WITHOUT
THESE WOMEN.

18
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,250
- IT'S THE PERFECT TIME
TO BE ALONE WITH TENCHI

19
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,000
WHILE EVERYONE ELSE
IS SLEEPING.

20
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,541
IT WILL BE SO ROMANTIC,
JUST A NICE,

21
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,875
OLD-FASHIONED GIRL LIKE
MYSELF, ALONE WITH HER MAN.

22
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,625
( laughs )

23
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,666
IMAGINE THE POSSIBILITIES
FOR TWO PEOPLE

24
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,666
SO VERY MUCH IN LOVE
WITH EACH OTHER.

25
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,666
PREPARE FOR BLISS!

26
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,958
STRANGE.  SOMEONE MUST HAVE
ACCIDENTALLY

27
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,875
BLOCKED OFF THE ENTRANCE
TO THE TUNNEL.

28
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,875
SEVERAL MEASLY LAYERS
OF CONCRETE AND WOOD

29
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,541
AREN'T GONNA KEEP ME
FROM MY LOVE.

30
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,750
MY HEAD'S MUCH TOO HARD
FOR THAT.

31
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:16,833
HA!

32
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,000
- ( grunts )

33
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,666
EARTHQUAKE!
TAKE COVER!

34
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,208
OOPS.

35
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,375
- Ryoko: MY LOVE.

36
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,666
- ARGH!

37
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,500
- OUCH.

38
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,458
OH, HE'S UNCONSCIOUS.

39
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,958
OH, MINOR HEAD TRAUMA'S
A SMALL PRICE TO PAY

40
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,416
TO FINALLY BE
TOGETHER.

41
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,625
- YOU'RE SQUEEZING ME
REALLY HARD, RYOKO.

42
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,208
- OH, POOR LITTLE GUY.

43
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,375
YOU MUST BE
IN SO MUCH PAIN NOW.

44
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:44,125
WHY DON'T YOU LIE DOWN IN BED
WITH RYOKO, TENCHI?

45
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,541
I'LL HEAL YOU
WITH THE POWER OF LOVE.

46
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,000
( giggles )
- ( Tenchi grunting )

47
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,375
- OH, SO YOU LIKE
TO PLAY ROUGH, DO YOU?

48
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,125
OOH, YOU'RE A FEISTY ONE.
- HELP!

49
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,875
- LOOK!
- HUH?

50
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,291
- THE BRIGHTEST STAR.

51
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,666
IT'S THE SUN,

52
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,166
BURNING HOT AND INFERNAL
DAY AFTER DAY

53
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,875
FOR ALL OF ETERNITY.

54
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,875
CAN YOU IMAGINE?  OUR LOVE
COULD BE STRONGER THAN THE SUN.

55
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,041
- ( screaming )

56
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,375
- OH, TENCHI, I KNEW
YOU CARED ABOUT ME,

57
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,458
THAT I WAS THE ONLY
WOMAN FOR YOU.

58
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,458
THIS IS SO ROMANTIC.

59
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:12,791
- HELP!
- YOU KNOW,

60
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,458
YOU COULD USE
A FEW POINTERS

61
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,708
ON HOW TO MAKE A GIRL
FEEL APPRECIATED.

62
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:17,958
( grunts )

63
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:21,000
HEY, I'M A LADY.
BE GENTLE.

64
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,916
PUT ME DOWN.

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,166
- ( Tenchi grunts )
- HEY, WAIT.

66
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,916
- ( Ryoko screams )

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,916
HEY, WHAT'S
THE BIG IDEA?

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,875
- STAY HERE.  AND DON'T GO
SNEAKING BACK OVER TO TOKYO.

69
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:34,333
I CANNOT TAKE THIS ANYMORE,
RYOKO.  THAT'S IT.

70
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,583
DON'T COME TO TOKYO
TILL I SAY.

71
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:37,833
YOU GOT IT?

72
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,625
- TENCHI, COME BACK.

73
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,500
WHY ARE YOU ANGRY,
MY LOVER?

74
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,125
DID I SHOCK YOU

75
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,041
OR SAY SOMETHING WRONG
IN A FIT OF PASSION?

76
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,250
- Ayeka: HEY!
- HMM?

77
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,000
- YOU'VE WOKEN UP
EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE

78
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,541
WITH YOUR COMMOTION,
RYOKO.

79
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,666
- YEAH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
UP THERE ANYWAY, RYOKO?

80
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,291
- I WAS KIND OF HARD
ON HER,

81
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,291
BUT SHE HAS TO LEARN
THE MEANING OF "NO."

82
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,333
OH, LOOK WHAT TIME IT IS.

83
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,291
OH, I'M LATE.

84
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:06,916
- HMM, IT SEEMS THAT WHEN
TENCHI FOLDS HIS COMFORTER,

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,625
IT CREATES A STRONG BARRIER
BLOCKING THE TUNNEL.

86
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,041
THERE'S NO WAY
WE CAN OPEN IT.

87
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,666
- HOW CAN YOU STAY SO CALM
WHEN THE TUNNEL'S BLOCKED?

88
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,500
DON'T YOU REALIZE
THIS MEANS

89
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,041
THAT WE CAN'T SEE TENCHI
WHENEVER WE WANT TO?

90
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,708
- WELL, THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

91
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,958
- WE KNOW
WHOSE FAULT THIS IS.

92
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,416
OH, BECAUSE OF YOUR
STUPIDITY

93
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,916
TENCHI'S PUNISHING
ALL OF US.

94
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,791
- ( whimpering )

95
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,166
- OH, MY TENCHI,

96
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,083
THIS GULF THAT LIES
BETWEEN US--

97
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,958
PARTING IS SUCH
SWEET SORROW.

98
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,541
( sobbing )

99
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,041
- Ryoko: WASHU.
- HMM?

100
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,958
- CAN'T YOU COME UP WITH SOME
SCIENTIFIC WAY TO FIX THIS?

101
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,583
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

102
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,208
HE HAS TO OPEN THE DIMENSIONAL
TUNNEL FROM HIS END

103
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,958
FOR IT TO BE
AT ALL ACCESSIBLE TO US.

104
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,208
HMM?
- IS THAT RIGHT?

105
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,083
THAT IS NOT
THE RIGHT ANSWER, WASHU.

106
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,333
NOW TELL ME YOU CAN DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.

107
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,041
- OH, OKAY, RYOKO.

108
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,125
I'M SURE I COULD
FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

109
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,708
- ( panting )

110
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,250
- MAN, YOU WORK HARD,
TENCHI.

111
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,708
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN HERE?

112
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,916
- NOT TOO LONG.
I WAS LATE.

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,750
- MY FATHER'S QUITE PLEASED
YOU'RE HERE.  ACTUALLY SO AM I.

114
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,583
OTHERWISE I'D BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR MAINTAINING THE SHRINE.

115
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,541
BUT I GUESS
IT'S QUITE AN HONOR

116
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,833
FOR YOU TO GET THE OPPORTUNITY
TO DO ALL THIS WORK.

117
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,041
- LUCKY GUY, I GUESS.

118
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,166
- WELL, TRY NOT TO BE
TOO LATE FOR SCHOOL.

119
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,000
- OH, NO, I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
I'M RUNNING LATE ALREADY?

120
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,000
- ( clock chiming )

121
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,041
- ( panting )

122
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,666
IF I CAN HOLD THIS PACE, I'LL
MAKE IT JUST BEFORE THE BELL.

123
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:52,625
- Boy: HEY, TENCHI.

124
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:53,875
- HI.
- HI.

125
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,958
- REPORTING, REPORTING.

126
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,625

RECEIVED.

127
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:05,958
- LOOK, WE HAVE
A TRANSMISSION.

128
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:11,000
- WOW, NOW WE CAN
REALLY SEE HIM.

129
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,083
- OH, TENCHI.
- OH, THERE YOU ARE, MY LOVE.

130
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,875
- MY REPORT DEVICE WILL
FOLLOW TENCHI AROUND ALL DAY

131
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,500
SO YOU CAN SEE
WHAT HE'S UP TO.

132
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,000
I SUSPECT THE ENTIRE FUTURE
OF ESPIONAGE

133
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,833
WILL BE ALTERED
BY MY INVENTION.

134
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,500
- THAT'S COOL, WASHU.

135
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,333
- MY TENCHI.
- MY MAN.

136

- I'LL SHOW YOU
HOW THIS VISUAL IMAGERY

160
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:06,958
TO TRANSMIT
THIS INFORMATION.

161
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,916
IT'S FOOLPROOF, EXCEPT FOR
THE SLIGHT TIME LAG.

162
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,833
IT'S ALL REALLY
QUITE FASCINATING.

163
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,291
DON'T YOU THINK SO,
GUYS?

164
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,875
HMM.

165
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,375
I DON'T SUPPOSE
ANY OF YOU LISTENED

166
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,375
TO A SINGLE WORD
THAT I SAID.

167
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,916
- TENCHI.

168
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,583
- MY SWEETIE PIE.

169
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,583
- ALL THEY EVER WANT
TO KNOW

170
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,125
IS WHAT TENCHI'S DOING
EVERY SINGLE MINUTE.

171
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,625
- YEAH, NO KIDDING.

172
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,416
( sighs )

173
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,208
- IT'S SO NICE TO SEE EVERYONE

174
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,916
PAYING SUCH CLOSE ATTENTION
TO THE MATERIAL.

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,916
- ( students laughing )

176
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,291
- ( giggling )
- ( gasps )

177
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:39,708
- Tenchi: ARGH!

178
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,916
- Sasami: WOW,
SCHOOL'S DANGEROUS.

179
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,541
- ( laughing )
- ( whimpering )

180
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,500
- Sasami: I DON'T THINK WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE SEEING THIS.

181
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,958
- ( giggles )
- HEY!  OH.

182
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,958
- ( slurping )

183
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,583
- YOU'RE BOTH BECOMING
COUCH POTATOES

184
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,916
WITHOUT ANY MANNERS.

185
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,375
- ( exclaiming )
- IT'S THAT GIRL AGAIN.

186
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,750
- LOOK AT HER FLIRT
WITH HIM.

187
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,333
SOME WOMEN
ARE SO DESPERATE.

188
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,750
( grunts )

189
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,750
OUR TENCHI WOULD NEVER
FALL FOR A GIRL

190
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,458
SO AGGRESSIVE,
LIKE THAT SAKUYA.

191
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,375
- EVERY TIME WE LOOK,
THERE SHE IS.

192
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,916
AND WE'RE
STUCK HERE.

193
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,416
- THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME WAY
FOR ME TO BE WITH TENCHI.

194
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,666
I JUST HAVE TO
FIGURE OUT HOW.

195
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,041
- ( Yugi laughing )

196
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,041
THEY'RE REALLY
SO AMUSING TO WATCH,

197
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,000
CLOWNING AROUND
LIKE THAT.

198
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,916
BUT I CAN'T JUST LET THEM
SPY ON PEOPLE LIKE THAT.

199
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,333
IT MUST STOP.

200
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,333
- ( train horn blows )

201
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:53,125
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU WANT TO BREAK UP?

202
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,000
IT'S JUST SO SUDDEN.

203
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,000
WHERE'S THIS COMING FROM?

204
00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:00,333
I KNOW WE'RE FAR APART,
BUT WE TRULY LOVE EACH OTHER.

205
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,500
AT LEAST
I LOVE YOU.

206
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:03,791
HELLO?

207
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,708
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU DON'T LOVE ME ANYMORE?

208
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,291
HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE?

209
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,083
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
HOW COOL I AM?

210
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,958
- ( phone clicks )
- ( dial tone )

211
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,708
- ( sobbing )

212
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,458
ONCE MY VOICE WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE
HER HEART START POUNDING

213
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,125
AND SHE WAS IMPRESSED BY MEN
WITH CELLULAR TELEPHONES.

214
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,708
( sobs )

215
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,750
I BOUGHT THIS PHONE
TO IMPRESS YOU, MY LOVE,

216
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,833
AND NOW YOU'RE USING IT
TO BREAK UP WITH ME.

217
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,208
( sobbing )

218
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,666
( babbling )

219
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,458
WHY?  WHY?

220
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,958
WAS IT MY HAIR

221
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,375
OR THE FACT THAT I'M WEARING
WHITE SHOES AFTER LABOR DAY?

222
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:51,583
WHY?

223
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,083
- ( laughs )

224
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,541
- HUMANS CANNOT ENDURE

225
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,333
THE TORMENTS OF
LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS.

226
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,833
THEY INEVITABLY LEAD
TO HEARTACHES

227
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,750
AND STRESS
AND PREMATURE BALDING.

228
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,125
I HAVE SEEN IT
HAPPEN.

229
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,375
THIS NEW DECREE
SHALL TAKE EFFECT NOW,

230
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,916
THE DECREE BEING
THE FOLLOWING:

231
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,125
LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS
ARE FORBIDDEN.

232
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:23,083
( grunts, laughs )

233
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,625
- Ryoko: HEY,
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

234
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,625
IS TENCHI CAUGHT
IN A WINDSTORM?

235
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,833
- NO, THAT'S INTERFERENCE.

236
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,625
THIS SHOULD BE
NO PROBLEM TO CLEAR UP.

237
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,916
HUH?  HOW COULD
THIS BE HAPPENING?

238
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,666
- Ayeka: WHAT?
- MY REPORT DEVICES ARE...

239
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,625
- WHAT, WASHU?
- ...FOOLING AROUND

240
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,916
INSTEAD OF WORKING
LIKE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO.

241
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,625
SOMEONE ELSE
MUST HAVE INTERFERED,

242
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,375
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT
PROGRAMMED TO SLACK.

243
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:46,791
- HUH?

244
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,500
- ( snoring )

245
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,375
- I FEEL SO ALIVE.

246
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,166
- HEY THERE, BABY.

247
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,125
YOU COME TO THIS SPOT OFTEN?
'CAUSE I DO.

248
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,375
I BET
YOU'RE AN AIR SIGN.

249
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,833
- THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

250
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,083
- WELL, THEN YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO
MAKE IT MAKE SENSE.

251
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:20,041
- DON'T RUSH ME.
I'M THINKING.

252
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,583
IF I COULD JUST
FIGURE OUT

253
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,958
WHAT'S INTERFERING
WITH THE SYSTEM.

254
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,375
- ( snoring )

255
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:29,041
I MUST DESTROY
LONG-DISTANCE LOVE.

256
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,791
- MEOW?

257
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,583
MEOW!

258
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,833
- MEOW, MEOW.

259
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,333
- ( thunder crashing )

260
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,500
- LONG-DISTANCE LOVE
IS FORBIDDEN.

261
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,333
( yells )

262
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:50,541
IT WILL NO LONGER BE A PLAGUE
TO ALL OF MANKIND.

263
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:53,041
BY THE POWER OF ALL THINGS
BIG AND PURPLE,

264
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,041
IT MUST END NOW!

265
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:59,333
- ( yells )

266
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,750
( growling )

267
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,166
- HI, MY LOVE.
YOU MISS ME?

268
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,166
( exclaims )

269
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,500
- HIYAH!

270
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,000
- THERE'S AN ORDER
COMING IN.

271
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,416
( yelling )

272
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,166
- MUST STOP
LONG-DISTANCE LOVE.

273
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,333
( screaming )

274
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:17,833
- LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS
ARE EVIL.

275
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,416
THEY MUST BE STOPPED.
THEY MUST BE STOPPED.

276
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,166
THEY MUST BE STOPPED.
OOH!  AH!

277
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,875
THEY'RE EVIL!

278
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,041
- IT MUST BE STOPPED.

279
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,791
IT MUST BE STOPPED.
IT MUST BE STOPPED.

280
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,791
- Ryoko: CAN'T YOU WORK
ANY FASTER?

281
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,791
TENCHI WILL BE
OLD AND GRAY

282
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,708
BY THE TIME
YOU GET THIS FIXED.

283
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,208
- BUT THAT SHOULD HAVE
DONE IT.

284
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,375
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

285
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,125
- OHH!

286
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,625
- MEN AND WOMEN
SEPARATED BY DISTANCE

287
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,041
WILL NEVER AGAIN
COMMUNICATE.

288
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:45,000
I'LL SCRAMBLE ALL
THE LONG-DISTANCE CALLS.

289
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,875
YOUR MISSION,
MY FRIENDS,

290
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,916
IS TO DESTROY ALL
LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS.

291
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,375
THEY MUST BE STOPPED.

292
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,375
- HEY, GUYS,
WHY AREN'T WE MOVING?

293
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,791
- SOMEONE'S BLOCKING
THE WAY.

294
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,000
- TENCHI'S MOVING A VERY LARGE
PIECE OF FURNITURE

295
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,500
UP THE STAIRS IN HIS SCHOOL.
- ( beeping )

296
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:10,083
- TENCHI HAS NOW BEGUN TO MOVE
THE STAIRS OF HIS SCHOOL

297
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:13,000
SO HE CAN CLIMB UP A VERY LARGE
PIECE OF FURNITURE.

298
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,000
- TENCHI'S CLIMBING
THE MOUNTAIN

299
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,083
TO FIND THE LAND
OF VERY LARGE FURNITURE.

300
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,666
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY.

301
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,625
- TENCHI'S ON TOP OF
A MOUNTAIN, WONDERING WHY.

302
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,416
- TENCHI IS OFF WANDERING AROUND
SOME BIG MOUNTAINTOP,

303
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,916
PROBABLY COMMUNING WITH NATURE,
SOMETHING LAME LIKE THAT.

304
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,291
- TENCHI-- TENCHI IS ABOUT
TO BE PUSHED OVER A CLIFF

305
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,708
BY A COW
AND A HIPPOPOTAMUS.

306
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,583
AND THE FALL
WILL MAKE HIM LAME.

307
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,750
- A HIPPO AND A COW

308
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,916
ARE ABOUT TO PUSH TENCHI
OFF A CLIFF.

309
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,416
- ( girls exclaim )

310
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,583
- WHAT'S HE DOING
UP THERE?

311
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,416
- WHERE DID HE FIND A HIPPO
IN JAPAN?

312
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,333
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S GOING ON.

313
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,041
- Boys: COME ON.  I'M OPEN.
GO, AMAGAZAKI, GO.

314
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,375
TENCHI.  COME ON.

315
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,958
- ( grunts )
- ( grunts )

316
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,791
- TENCHI IS IN THE CAGE
AND HAS JUST BLOCKED

317
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,583
A BULLET-LIKE SHOT
FROM HIS FRIEND.

318
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,416
NOW HE HOLDS
A SOCCER BALL.

319
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,583
- TENCHI HAD TO BE
RESTRAINED IN A CAGE

320
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,750
AND NOW HIS FRIENDS ARE SHOOTING
AT HIM WITH BALLS AND BULLETS.

321
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:07,041
- TENCHI HAS BECOME A VICIOUS
AND UNCONTROLLABLE WILD ANIMAL

322
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,666
AND HAS BEEN EXILED IN A CAGE
BY HIS GUN-TOTING FRIENDS.

323
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,625
- TENCHI'S BECOME
A VICIOUS ANIMAL,

324
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,875
SO HIS FRIENDS EXILED HIM
TO SOME ISLAND FOR CRIMINALS.

325
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,208
- TENCHI, HE'S BECOME
A MONSTER

326
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,125
AND HE'S BEING SHOT AT
IN AUSTRALIA.

327
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:22,375
- LET'S SEE, TENCHI HAS BECOME
A VICIOUS DEMON

328
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,291
AND HE'S SPENDING TIME
IN HELL.

329
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,083
AND EGGS ARE BEING
THROWN AT HIM NOW.

330
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,250
- ( beeping )

331
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,291
TENCHI HAS BECOME
THE EGG-HATING DEMON OF HELL.

332
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:33,875
- ( all scream )

333
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,291
- WASHU, ARE YOU JUST TRYING
TO MESS WITH MY MIND?

334
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,333
- NO, YOUR MIND REALLY
DOESN'T NEED MY HELP.

335
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,916
HERE WE GO.

336
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,666
- TENCHI FINDS TRUE LOVE
ON A DESERTED ISLAND.

337
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,000
- ( growls )

338
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,583
- WELL, THE SUNSET'S
KIND OF PRETTY.

339
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,166
- Ayeka: THIS IS
JUST TERRIBLE.

340
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,250
EACH PICTURE
IS WORSE THAN THE LAST.

341
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:53,833
( whimpering )

342
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,166
- Washu: LOUNGING
ON A SUNSET BEACH

343
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,666
WITH A GIRL--
THAT'S NOT SO BAD.

344
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,125
BUT I MUST ADMIT,
IT'S NOT LIKE TENCHI AT ALL.

345
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,666
- THIS IS YOUR FAULT.

346
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,958
- ( slurping )

347
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,125
- HMM?

348
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:07,000
DID YOU JUST HEAR
A STRANGE NOISE?

349
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,416
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

350
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,541
- NEVER MIND.  IT'S MY
IMAGINATION.  GOTTA GO.

351
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:11,791
- HUH?

352
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:12,958
- I GUESS
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

353
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,583
- WELL, I'LL WALK
WITH YOU.

354
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:15,875
- THANKS.

355
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,291
- THAT WAS A GREAT SAVE
AT SOCCER TODAY.

356
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,750
- Sasami: WHA--
WHAT IS HE DOING?

357
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,875
- I'VE LOST HIM
FOREVER.

358
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,041
- ( gasps ) AYEKA?
DON'T LOSE IT.

359
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,708
THIS HAS GOT TO BE
SOME KIND OF MISTAKE.

360
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,916
- TENCHI, HOW COULD YOU
DO THIS TO ME?

361
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,625
YOU'RE SUCH A CRUEL MAN.

362
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,375
I LOVE YOU.

363
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,458
- I CAN'T EVEN HEAR
MY OWN THOUGHTS IN THIS ROOM.

364
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:38,500
- HMM?

365
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,958
- I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

366
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,875
- ( panting )

367
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,416
- Sasami: WHAT IN THE WORLD?

368
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,375
- ( trumpets )

369
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,875
- AN ELEPHANT COSTUME--

370
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,791
THAT'S NICE.

371
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:57,208
- OH, MY DEAR TENCHI,
IF ONLY I UNDERSTOOD

372
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,041
WHY YOU WERE PRACTICING
CALLIGRAPHY

373
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,750
IN AN ELEPHANT COSTUME.

374
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:05,750
- ( sighs )
- HEY, AYEKA.

375
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,750
- OH, TENCHI, HAVE I REALLY
DONE SOMETHING SO HORRIFIC

376
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,583
TO DRIVE YOU TO THIS?

377
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:11,791
- STAY HERE.

378
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,916
AND DON'T GO SNEAKING
BACK OVER TO TOKYO.

379
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,583
- ( whimpering )

380
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,208
- ( girls giggling )

381
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,000
- SO THIS IS
THE SOUVENIR YOU WANT?

382
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,125
YOU KNOW, IT'S MY
FAVORITE ONE TOO.

383
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,916
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DO THAT
WITH HER AS WELL.

384
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
NASTY YOU!

385
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,208
- MEOW!

386
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,916
- HEY!  I'VE GOT IT.

387
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,750
SOME POWERFUL
SUPERNATURAL AGENT

388
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,541
IS MANIPULATING
MY REPORT DEVICES.

389
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,458
- WHAT?
- FROM WHERE?

390
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,083
- IT'S EXACTLY HALFWAY
BETWEEN TOKYO AND HERE.

391
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,666
I HAVE TO GO THERE TO FIND OUT
WHAT'S DOING IT.

392
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,041
- GREAT.  LET'S GO.
- OH, MY.

393
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,125
- FIRE UP THAT PET OF OURS.
- BUT, RYOKO,

394
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,666
TENCHI SAID HE WANTED US
TO WAIT FOR HIM HERE.

395
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,708
- ( grunts )

396
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,416
- DON'T COME TO TOKYO.

397
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,958
- ARGH!  DON'T BE SUCH
A GOODY-TWO-SHOES.

398
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,833
AS LONG AS WE DON'T GO
TO TOKYO, WE'LL BE FINE.

399
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,541
- RIGHT.
OKAY, RYO-OHKI,

400
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:57,791
YOU READY?
- MEOW.

401
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,291
MEOW!

402
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,500
- LET'S GO.

403
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,500
- STRAIGHT AHEAD,
RYO-OHKI.

404
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:10,541
- MEOW!

405
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,166
- Ryoko: I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU ARE,

406
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,625
BUT I DON'T TAKE
BEING MADE A FOOL OF LIGHTLY.

407
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,791
- THEY'LL SOON LEARN
THAT I AIN'T JOKING.

408
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,666
I SENSE HEARTS
WAITING TO BE BROKEN.

409
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,875
I WON'T BE SABOTAGED.

410
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,000
PREPARE TO HAVE YOUR LOVE
ANNIHILATED.

411
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,000
- SOMETHING'S HEADED
OUR WAY, RYOKO.

412
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:30,958
- HMM.

413
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,250
- ( growling )

414
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,458
- WE'RE STILL OUTSIDE
OF TOKYO, RYOKO,

415
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,875
SO IT SHOULD BE OKAY.
- LOOK AT THAT.

416
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,958
WHO ARE YOU?
AND WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

417
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,333
- MY NAME IS ZUMINO.
I AM THE GREAT SPIRIT

418
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:47,166
OF CELLULAR PHONES
AND OTHER CORDLESS DEVICES.

419
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,666
- THERE'S A SPIRIT
FOR EVERYTHING.

420
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,875
- HE DOESN'T
LOOK HAPPY.

421
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,416
- ( grunts )
THE BATTERED AND ANGUISHED SOULS

422
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,541
OF THE MANY MEN DUMPED
OVER THE CELLULAR PHONE

423
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,166
HAS DRIVEN ME TO THIS
DRASTIC AND FINAL MEASURE.

424
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,375
- MEOW!

425
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,250
- LONG-DISTANCE LOVE
IS FORBIDDEN,

426
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,083
AND YOU WILL NOT DEFY ME.
YAH!

427
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,416
LONG-DISTANCE LOVE
IS EVIL!

428
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,666
IT IS FORBIDDEN!

429
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,791
- MEOW!

430
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,875
- SASAMI, GET IN
CLOSER TO HIM.

431
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,791
- BUT WHAT ABOUT
HIS LASER BEAM?

432
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,125
- CLOSER!

433
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,083
GET SET, BUDDY,
'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA BLAST YOU.

434
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,708
OH, YOU'LL BE SORRY
THAT YOU EVER TRIED

435
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,916
TO MAKE A MOCKERY
OF MY LOVE FOR TENCHI.

436
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,250
- MEOW!

437
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:28,416
- ( grunting )

438
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,125
IT IS FORBIDDEN.

439
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,041
- WATCH OUT!
- NOW WE'VE GOT HIM.

440
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,416
OH!
- MEOW!

441
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,125
- ( screams )

442
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,208
- MEOW!

443
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,833
- ( laughs )

444
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,083
THAT'LL TEACH THEM TO MESS
WITH A BIG PURPLE MONSTER.

445
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,166
- Ryoko: HEY, TALL STUFF.
- HUH?

446
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,375
- HA!

447
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,083
- ( grunting )

448
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,000
- NICE BOW YOU'VE GOT,
BIG BOY.

449
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,333
DID YOUR MAMA
BUY THAT FOR YOU, HUH?

450
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:52,791
- MY LASERS
DON'T WORK ON HER.

451
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:56,250
- THAT'S RIGHT.  AND NEITHER
DOES YOUR CHARM, BUD.

452
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,375
- ( monster babbling )

453
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,041
- YES!

454
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,666
- ( birds chirping )

455
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,916
- OH?

456
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,208
ALIENS ARE FALLING
FROM THE SKY.

457
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,125
- OH, I'M NOTHING BUT A FIGMENT
OF YOUR IMAGINATION.  BYE.

458
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:32,250
- ( laughing )

459
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,791
WELL, AT LEAST WE PUT AN END
TO THE SPYING.

460
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:41,291
- GEE, WASHU, YOU SURE KNOW
HOW TO PUT US IN DANGER.

461
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,291
- NOW I KNOW
WHERE WE WENT WRONG.

462
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,458
AND I HAVE ENOUGH DATA
TO MAKE A NEW PROTOTYPE.

463
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,958
- HOW'S EVERYONE
DOING IN HERE?

464
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,000
- IT'S YOU!

465
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,041
- WHOO!  HI, TENCHI.

466
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,291
- IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

467
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,250
- PRIEST DOKUZEN
GAVE ME THESE COOKIES

468
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,875
AND I THOUGHT WE COULD ALL
SHARE THEM TOGETHER.

469
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,375
AND YOU LIKE SWEETS.
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S SWEET.

470
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,333
- ( both scream )

471
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,333
- I WAS SO WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

472
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,166
OH, YOU HAVE NO IDEA
AT ALL, TENCHI.

473
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,000
WE DIDN'T KNOW
IF YOU WERE ALL RIGHT OR--

474
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,333
OR IF WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU
OR IF YOU WERE HURT

475
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:14,333
OR IF YOU NEEDED HELP.
( sobbing )

476
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,833
- HMM?

477
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,583
- WELL, I'LL GET
SOME MILK

478
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,500
TO GO WITH THE COOKIES
TENCHI BROUGHT US.

479
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:22,250
- I'LL HELP.
- DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TODAY?

480
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:25,000
WHY IS EVERYBODY
ACTING WEIRD?

481
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:28,666
- UH, MM...

482
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,333
NOTHING HAPPENED.

483
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,083
IT WAS JUST
A LONG DAY.

484
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,208
- FOR ME TOO.

485
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,125
- REALLY?

486
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,125
( giggles )

487
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,250
- ( upbeat song playing )

488
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,750
- MEOW, MEOW.

489
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:06,875
MEOW.

490
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:10,125
MEOW.

491
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:12,666
- HI.  I'M SASAMI.

492
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,625
WHAT?  TENCHI'S GETTING
MARRIED TO SAKUYA?

493
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:19,041
HOORAY!  I'D BE VERY HAPPY
TO HEAR WEDDING BELLS.

494
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:21,416
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS
THAT IF RYOKO

495
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,833
AND MY SISTER AYEKA
EVER FIND OUT ABOUT THIS,

496
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:25,541
THEY WOULD
REALLY BE UPSET.

497
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:27,666
I BET THEY'D FIGHT
TO THE DEATH.

498
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,208
THAT'S NOT ALL
THAT'S GOING ON.

499
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:31,291
SOMETHING IS NOT
QUITE RIGHT.

500
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,500
WHAT KIND OF PLACE
IS THIS MANSION?

501
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,625
I DON'T HAVE A GOOD FEELING
ABOUT IT.

502
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:39,041
