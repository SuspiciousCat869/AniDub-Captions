1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,916
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:45,541
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,125
- ( gasps )

4
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:39,083
- A WHEEL OF LIGHT IS TURNING.

5
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,750
TURNING...

6
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,916
IT LOOKS SO WARM

7
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
AND SWEET.

8
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:48,125
FEELS JUST LIKE A DREAM.

9
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,416
LOOK, RYOKO'S DRIFTING AWAY
FROM THE OTHERS.

10
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,833
DREAM TIME WILL SOON BE OVER.

11
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:08,458
YES.

12
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,083
I WILL SOON END IT.

13
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,083
( chuckles )

14
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,958
- ( panting )

15
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:54,458
- ( exhales )

16
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:55,625
( grunts )

17
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,291
- HEY, BABY,
YOU LOOK LONELY.

18
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,791
BOYFRIEND STAND YOU UP?

19
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,541
- WE'LL HELP YOU 
FORGET ABOUT HIM.

20
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,708
COME WITH US.
WE'LL HAVE SOME FUN TOGETHER.

21
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,958
- HEY, YOU WANT US TO BEG? 
YOU'RE ALONE ANYWAY, RIGHT?

22
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,041
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

23
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,666
- YOUR BOYFRIEND
WON'T SHOW UP, SWEETIE.

24
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,458
SO COME ON WITH US.
- YEAH, HE STOOD YOU UP.

25
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:48,458
FACE IT.

26
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,583
- GET LOST.

27
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,416
- WHAT'S THAT?
I, UH, COULDN'T REALLY HEAR YOU.

28
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,541
- YEAH, WE DIDN'T MAKE YOU MAD
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, DID WE?

29
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,916
- I SAID GET LOST!

30
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,666
- Both: UH...

31
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,666
HUH?

32
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,791
- ( breathes deeply, groans )

33
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,041
- RYOKO.
- ( gasps )

34
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,708
TENCHI, IT'S YOU.

35
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,208
- I'M WAITING.
JUST TAKE MY HAND.

36
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,250
- YOU WANT ME?

37
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,625
( groans softly )

38
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,333
HEY!  HMM?

39
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:35,583
( gasps slightly )

40
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,833
( grunts )

41
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,000
- ( both laughing )

42
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,291
( both scream )

43
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,083
- THAT IS RUDE.

44
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,250
- SHE WAS IN A HURRY.

45
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:04,041
- SOMEONE'S STALKING ME
VERY QUIETLY.

46
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,000
I CAN FEEL THEM THERE,
DEFINITELY.

47
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,333
WHERE ARE YOU?

48
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,541
WHERE ARE YOU?

49
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,000
WHERE ARE YOU HIDING?

50
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:16,833
WHERE WHERE WHERE?!

51
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,458
( gasps )

52
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,000
AAH!

53
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,041
( grunts )

54
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,916
OH, THIS ISN'T LIKE ME.

55
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,291
I'M GETTING CARELESS,
LOSING MY EDGE.

56
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,541
( gasps )

57
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,375
( gasps )

58
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,083
WHAT'S THIS?

59
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,958
AAH!

60
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:06,583
- ( gasps )

61
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,541
- WHAT IS IT, TENCHI?
- HUH?

62
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:14,166
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?
- UH, NO, NOTHING.

63
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,666
- WELL, AS I WAS SAYING,

64
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,000
WE DECIDED TO GO ON A TRIP
DURING SUMMER BREAK.

65
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,958
CLASSES WILL BE OVER, SO
THERE'S NO REASON TO STAY HERE.

66
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,041
IT COULD BE SO MUCH FUN.
DON'T YOU THINK, TENCHI?

67
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,791
- ( panting )

68
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,250
I KNOW THIS PLACE.

69
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,250
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

70
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,083
( gasps )

71
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,583
( grunts )
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

72
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,583
- THAT IS NO WAY TO GREET
AN OLD FRIEND,

73
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,791
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU
ARE TRESPASSING.

74
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,333
- SO THIS WAS YOUR DOING,
EH, HOTSUMA?

75
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,750
- RYOKO, YOU LISTEN HERE.

76
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:06,750
- WHY SHOULD I?!

77
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,083
( grunts )

78
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,500
AAH!

79
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,458
( grunts )

80
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,708
- LOOK AT IT, RYOKO.

81
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,625
- ( gasps slightly )
LET ME GO.

82
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,041
- I SAID LOOK!

83
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,958
- ( groans )

84
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,083
WHAT?

85
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,708
WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS?

86
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:38,166
- THEY ARE BIO-ROID ENFORCERS
CREATED BY THE GALAXY PRINCE 

87
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,166
TO HUNT DOWN
FIRST CLASS CRIMINALS.

88
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,666
THEY WORK IN SECRET,
AND THEY DESTROY THEIR PREY

89
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,750
WITHOUT LEAVING A TRACE.

90
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,583
- WOW!  YOU THINK
THERE ARE ENOUGH OF THEM?!

91
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,625
WHY WOULD THEY SEND THEM 
DOWN HERE TO THIS PLANET?

92
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,500
- YOU SEEM TO HAVE
FORGOTTEN WHO YOU ARE.

93
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:52,791
- ( gasps )

94
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,833
- THEY'RE AFTER THE MOST
NOTORIOUS SPACE PIRATE

95
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,083
IN THE HISTORY OF THE GALAXY--

96
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,250
YOU.

97
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,708
- AND HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THAT?

98
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,041
- I HAVE MY SOURCES.

99
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,041
I LOST A BATTLE TO THEM
SIX MONTHS AGO,

100
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:05,541
AND I'VE BEEN HIDING HERE EVER
SINCE, WAITING FOR MY CHANCE.

101
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,500
- WHAT KIND OF CHANCE?

102
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:08,875
- THIS KIND.

103
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,916
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR
SOMEONE LIKE YOU

104
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,041
TO TEAM UP WITH
AGAINST THE GALAXY POLICE

105
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,791
TO BLAZE INTO GLORIOUS BATTLE.

106
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,833
WE CAN SET THE WHOLE GALAXY
ON FIRE, RYOKO.

107
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:22,833
TAKE A LOOK AT MY TOWER.

108
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,083
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GET OFF THIS PLANET?

109
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:55,083
YOU BELONG UP THERE
AMONG THE SHINING STARS.

110
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,583
- HMM...

111
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,041
- ( meows )

112
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,083
- ( meows )

113
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:23,250
- WELL, SUMMER BREAK
IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER.

114
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,416
TIME JUST FLIES BY,
DOESN'T IT?

115
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,458
- UH-HUH. OH, AND MATSUNO SAID
SHE AND THE OTHERS

116
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:28,458
ARE GOING TO THE BEACH.

117
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,958
- THE BEACH, HUH?


118
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,875
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE
GONE DOWN TO THE OCEAN.

119
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,416
- DO YOU LIKE IT THERE?

120
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,083
- YEAH, I USED TO
GO THERE A LOT.

121
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,250
WHEN I WAS LITTLE,
I WENT WITH MY FAMILY.

122
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,416
I USED TO TAKE MY BIKE,
AND MY MOTHER WOULD WALK

123
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,833
WITH THIS BIG PARASOL.

124
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,625
THERE WAS A STEEP SLOPE,
AND AT THE BOTTOM,

125
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:49,291
THE OCEAN STRETCHED OUT AS FAR
AS YOU COULD SEE, SPARKLING.

126
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,250
JUST BEING THERE 
WITH MY MOTHER...

127
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:55,208
THERE WAS SOMETHING
SPECIAL ABOUT IT.

128
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:58,583
IT'S THE KIND OF THING
YOU NEVER FORGET.

129
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,083
MY FATHER SAID I THREW A FIT
WHEN WE HAD TO LEAVE.

130
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,916
I COULD HAVE STAYED THERE
FOREVER.

131
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,916
- YOU'RE MAKING ME
WANNA GO THERE.

132
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,583
MM, JUST TO SEE THE WAVES
AND FEEL THE BREEZE.

133
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,916
- SAKUYA?
- HMM?

134
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,916
- MAYBE WE COULD GO THERE
TOGETHER SOMETIME.

135
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,041
- UH-HUH.
- IT'S KIND OF A LONG WAY,

136
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,875
YOU KNOW,
IF WE GO TO OKAYAMA.

137
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,375
BUT IT'D BE WORTH IT. I'M SURE
IT'S STILL JUST AS BEAUTIFUL. 

138
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,000
- TENCHI...

139
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,291
MM.

140
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,333
CAN I RIDE YOUR BIKE
WHEN WE GET THERE?

141
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,916
- ( chuckles )
YOU BET!

142
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,708
- I CAN'T WAIT!

143
00:12:56,791 --> 00:13:00,416
- LEAVE ME ALONE!
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT TROUBLE.

144
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,250
- ( gasps )
TENCHI...

145
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,125
YOU REALLY THINK YOU DON'T
NEED US ANYMORE?

146
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,375
YOU DON'T NEED ME ANYMORE?

147
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,416
NO NO.

148
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,000
IT CAN'T BE TRUE.

149
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,500
YOU DIDN'T MEAN IT THAT WAY.
I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS.

150
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:16,250
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT...

151
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,208
BECAUSE IF I DID,
I'D BE LOST.

152
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,375
- RYOKO,
LET'S BLOW THIS PLANET.

153
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,416
- DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO. I
DON'T NEED A PARTNER OR A BOSS.

154
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,125
- THEY'LL HUNT YOU DOWN IF YOU
STAY HERE! YOU HAVE TO GO!

155
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,458
- I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING,
EXCEPT GET YOU OFF MY BACK!

156
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:42,833
AM I BEING CLEAR?!

157
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:43,791
( gasps )

158
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,875
- WATCH OUT!
IT'S A WEB MANEUVER!

159
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,166
- ( grunting )

160
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,458
I DON'T WANT YOUR HELP.
JUST GET OUT OF HERE!

161
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,458
- NOT WITHOUT YOU.
I NEED YOU AND YOU NEED ME.

162
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,250
- YEAH, RIGHT,
LIKE I NEED A DISEASE.

163
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,250
- THIS PLANET IS RUINING YOU.

164
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:12,000
PEOPLE USED TO FEAR YOU.
YOUR NAME SPREAD TERROR 

165
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,416
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE GALAXY.

166
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,916
- JUST SHUT UP!

167
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,750
- YOU'RE A PIRATE, MY DEAR.
THAT'S YOUR DESTINY.

168
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,541
WHAT WE BOTH WANT CAN ONLY
BE GAINED THROUGH BLOOD,

169
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:21,833
FIRE AND DISASTER!

170
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,083
- YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME!

171
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:27,416
- I KNOW YOU'RE WASTING YOURSELF
ON THIS PITIFUL LITTLE PLANET,

172
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,041
WHILE POWER AND GLORY
AWAIT YOU OUT IN SPACE.

173
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,291
- I'VE BEEN THERE!

174
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,166
SPACE IS BIG AND EMPTY.

175
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,500
I BELONG RIGHT HERE,
RIGHT ON THIS PLANET...

176
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:37,625
BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING--

177
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,166
SOMETHING I LOST.

178
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,125
( groans )

179
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,333
- ( chuckles softly )

180
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,666
- THAT GIRL AND TENCHI...

181
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,250
I JUST CAN'T TAKE IT.

182
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,041
( screams )

183
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,958
( panting )

184
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,125
- ( chuckles softly )

185
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,166
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU JUST PROVED MY POINT.

186
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,166
YOU DON'T BELONG HERE.

187
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,291
COME WITH ME, RYOKO.

188
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,833
- ( chuckles )

189
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,375
PRINCESS AYEKA,

190
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:27,000
HAVING A HARD TIME
FALLING ASLEEP, ARE YOU?

191
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,458
- YES. HOW DO YOU KNOW
MY NAME, PRAY TELL?

192
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,125
WHO ARE YOU?

193
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,375
WHAT ARE YOU?

194
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,875
- A SORCERER.

195
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,000
- HUH?

196
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,708
- AHEM...

197
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,958
PRINCESS, I'VE COME HERE
TO HELP YOU UNTANGLE

198
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,708
THE RIDDLES THAT HAVE
BEEN TROUBLING YOU.

199
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,708
- WHAT RIDDLES?

200
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,583
- A MAN CAPTURED YOUR HEART,

201
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,375
AND HE KEEPS IT LIKE
A BIRD IN A CAGE.

202
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,625
- ( gasps )
- TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

203
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,625
LOOK DEEPLY
AND SEE THE TRUTH.

204
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,583
NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU
MAY LOVE HIM,

205
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,083
HE WILL NEVER
COME BACK TO YOU.

206
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,583
AND YOU KNOW THE REASON.

207
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:03,875
- ( water trickling )

208
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,875
- HE'S FOUND A NEW WORLD
AND A NEW LOVE

209
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,875
IN A LAND FAR AWAY FROM HERE.

210
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,750
PEOPLE CHANGE, PRINCESS.

211
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,375
- IT'S NOT TRUE.

212
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,333
- BUT YOU KNOW IT IS.

213
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,083
- LIAR LIAR LIAR!

214
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,583
TENCHI ISN'T LIKE THAT.
HE'S NOT, HE'S NOT!

215
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,291
HE'LL COME BACK TO ME,
I KNOW IT.

216
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,791
- OH...

217
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,291
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT,
OR ARE YOU JUST TRYING

218
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,666
TO CONVINCE YOURSELF
BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO MANY DOUBTS?

219
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,000
- I BELIEVE IN HIM.

220
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,541
- WELL, THEN ALL YOU
HAVE TO DO IS ASK HIM.

221
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,500
THEN YOU'LL KNOW
FOR CERTAIN, PRINCESS.

222
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,916
I'LL BE HERE TO HELP YOU,
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.

223
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,791
CALL HIM, AYEKA.

224
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,125
- ( gasps )

225
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,083
WAIT!  DON'T GO!

226
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:36,458
- (Sorcerer's voice) WELL, THEN
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ASK HIM.

227
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,416
THEN YOU'LL KNOW
FOR CERTAIN, PRINCESS.

228
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,750
- TENCHI...

229
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,541
- AWW...

230
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,250
I NEED THE PHONE.

231
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,708
- OH.

232
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,375
- ( laughs )

233
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,500
- ( keys beeping )

234
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,083
- ( line ringing )

235
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,583
- Tenchi:
Yes, this is Tenchi.

236
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,541
- HI, TENCHI!
 IT'S SASAMI.

237
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,958
RISE AND SHINE!
IT'S TIME FOR BREAKFAST.

238
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,875
AND NONE OF THOSE
FROZEN WAFFLES.

239
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,541
EAT SOMETHING FRESH 
THAT'S GOOD FOR YOU.

240
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,416
WHAT?  UH-HUH.

241
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,666
WELL, YEAH,
WE'RE DOING GREAT.

242
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,458
UH-HUH.

243
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,958
OH, AYEKA'S HERE TOO.

244
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,458
I'LL GIVE HER THE PHONE,
SO YOU CAN SAY HELLO.

245
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,875
HOLD ON.
HERE SHE IS.

246
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,625
TAKE IT.

247
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,416
- ( shakily )
SASAMI, I--

248
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,208
- GO ON,
IT'S LONG-DISTANCE.

249
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,791
- HELLO, TENCHI.

250
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,458
IT SEEMS LIKE A LONG TIME
SINCE WE'VE TALKED.

251
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:42,791
- Long time? What do you mean?
We saw each other yesterday.

252
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,958
- I KNOW, BUT IT FEELS
LIKE AGES SOMEHOW.

253
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:49,291
- Ayeka, I'd like to and all,
but I gotta get to school.

254
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,791
- WAIT, I WANTED
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

255
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,583
- SURE.  FIRE AWAY.

256
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:56,583
- Well, I know you have
 new friends at school.

257
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,333
How are you getting along
with them?

258
00:19:58,416 --> 00:19:59,750
- JUST FINE.  WHY?

259
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:03,166
- THAT GIRL--
IS IT FINE WITH HER TOO?

260
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,666
- Uh, what?

261
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,583
- YOU KNOW WHO I MEAN.

262
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:07,666
SAKUYA.

263
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,250
- ( doorbell rings )

264
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,458
- HUH?

265
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,291
EXCUSE ME.
I HAVE TO GET THE DOOR.

266
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,833
- Uh, wait!  Tenchi!

267
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,625
- SORRY!
I'LL BE JUST A MINUTE.

268
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,125
- Sakuya: YOU'RE LATE.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE

269
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,625
TO RUN TO SCHOOL AGAIN.

270
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:29,833
- ( whimpers )

271
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,291
- Tenchi:
What's our first class today?

272
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,708
- Well, you remember.
Our Middle Old Japanese.

273
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,083
- I think we'll make it.

274
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,916
- AH, YOUR TIE IS CROOKED AGAIN.

275
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,875
- AYEKA, I'LL CALL YOU
BACK LATER, OKAY?

276
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,333
OKAY, LET'S GO.
YOU READY?

277
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:48,666
- MM-HMM.

278
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:59,958
- OH.  I'M SORRY, AYEKA.

279
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,333
- FAREWELL.

280
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,833
- ( chuckles )

281
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:25,833
- GO.

282
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,833
YOU'VE SERVED YOUR PURPOSE.

283
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,208
( chuckles )

284
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,875
GOOD-BYE, DEAR RYOKO.

285
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,833
- ( upbeat music playing )

286
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,000
- ( people singing in Japanese )

287
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:05,500
- YEAH!
( growls )

288
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:07,500
MEOW.

289
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:14,000
- HELLO, I'M AYEKA.

290
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:17,166
CONGRATULATIONS, MIHOSHI AND
KIYONE, FOR YOUR PROMOTION.

291
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,791
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.
BUT I'LL MISS YOU VERY MUCH

292
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:21,875
WHILE YOU'RE ON
YOUR ASSIGNMENT ON PLUTO.

293
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:25,541
MISS WASHU HAS LOCKED HERSELF 
IN HER LAB, AND RYOKO IS GONE.

294
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:28,375
SO OUR DINING TABLE-- WHICH
HAS ALWAYS BEEN SO CROWDED,

295
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:30,708
IS NOW DESERTED AND LONELY.

296
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:34,541
OH, LORD TENCHI,
WHAT HAS BECOME OF US?

297
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:37,666
THE NEXT EPISODE OF
THE NEW TENCHI MUYO SERIES...
