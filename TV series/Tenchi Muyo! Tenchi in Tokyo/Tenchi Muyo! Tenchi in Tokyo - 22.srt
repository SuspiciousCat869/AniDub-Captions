1
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,041
- ( theme music plays )

2
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,416
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,791
- MAY YOU BE FILLED
WITH PEACE AND PURE SPIRIT.

4
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,625
- Dokuzen:
WELL, WELL, WELL.

5
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,916
IT ALMOST APPEARS AS IF
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

6
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,458
- OH, MASTER?
- YOU KNOW,

7
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:14,750
SOME OF IT
LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.

8
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,916
BUT YOUR FORM ISN'T
QUITE RIGHT YET.

9
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,916
YOU MUST SWING
THE SACRED STAFF SMOOTHLY.

10
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,541
WATCH ME. 
( groans )

11
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:21,958
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

12
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,583
- ( groans )
- ( pants ) 

13
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,250
- YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE PUSHED
YOUR BODY SO HARD.

14
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,291
- Sakuya: HOLD IT,
DON'T MOVE.

15
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,166
JUST STAY RIGHT THERE
AND SMILE.

16
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,208
- CHEESE!
- ( groans )

17
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,333
- YOU MOVED! 
I SAID DON'T.

18
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,791
- SAKUYA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:35,833
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,541
- GEE, ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

21
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,375
I'M TAKING YOUR PICTURE.

22
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:40,500
- WHY?
- ( laughs )

23
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:41,875
- I WANT TO MAKE
A VISUAL RECORD 

24
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,500
OF MY SUMMER BREAK WITH YOU
TO PUT IN MY PHOTO ALBUM

25
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,583
TO REMEMBER
OUR TIME TOGETHER.

26
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,000
- SAKUYA.

27
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,291
- I PLAN TO BE TAKING
PICTURES AROUND HERE 

28
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,458
UNTIL YOUR TRAINING IS OVER.

29
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:52,500
YOU'LL GET USED TO IT.

30
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:53,500
- OH.
- HMPH.

31
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:54,750
- SO DON'T MIND ME, OKAY?

32
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,041
JUST GO ON AND DO
WHATEVER YOU NORMALLY DO.

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,916
- ( camera clicks )

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,958
( clicking )

35
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:06,041
( clicking )

36
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,458
( clicking )

37
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,375
- IT SEEMS A BIT STRANGE.

38
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:16,291
WHAT SHE DOES
MAKES NO SENSE TO ME.

39
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,333
- OH, SMILE.

40
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,916
- Ayeka:
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?!

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,333
I CAN'T BELIEVE MY EARS!

42
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,541
SASAMI, TELL ME AGAIN
WHAT YOU SAID.

43
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,416
- YESTERDAY,
RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES,

44
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,458
MY FRIEND YUGI
SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED.

45
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,208
- ( wind whooshes )

46
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,166
- ( explosion )

47
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,916
- ( thinking ) SHE SAID 
THAT HIDEOUS NAME AGAIN.

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,625
HOW MANY YUGIS
CAN THERE BE?

49
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,833
- HUH?
WHAT'S THE MATTER, AYEKA?

50
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,625
CAT GOT YOUR TONGUE?
- ( meows )

51
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,000
- THAT EVIL BEING WHO
ATTACKED THE MASAKI SHRINE

52
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,666
CALLED HERSELF YUGI ALSO.

53
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,708
- WHAT?! IT'S GOT TO BE
JUST A COINCIDENCE.

54
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,333
- ALL RIGHT, SASAMI,
LET'S FIND OUT

55
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,833
IF IT'S COINCIDENCE,
ALL RIGHT?

56
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,166
WAIT THERE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

57
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,125
I'M PRETTY SURE THIS ONE
CAPTURES HER APPEARANCE.

58
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,500
- DO YOU THINK I GOT
HER EYES RIGHT, RYO-OHKI?

59
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,458
- ( meows )
- I'M DONE WITH MINE.

60
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,583
NOW, SASAMI, TELL ME.
IS THIS YOUR FRIEND? 

61
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,291
- NO, THIS IS MY YUGI.

62
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,500
I'M NOT SURE
ABOUT THAT ONE.

63
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,083
OUR DRAWINGS
DON'T LOOK ALIKE.

64
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,708
- HMPH.

65
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,041
THIS IS A BUST.

66
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:28,000
THERE MUST BE A BETTER WAY
TO SHOW YOU HER.  AH!

67
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,541
- ( computer beeps )

68
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:32,125
- WHAT'S UP?
YOU NEED MY HELP?

69
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,666
- MISS WASHU,
COULD YOU PLEASE

70
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,333
SHOW SASAMI THE VIDEO TAPE
YOU MADE OF YUGI?

71
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,500
- NO PROBLEM.
HERE YOU GO. 

72
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,500
( snaps )

73
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,333
- NOW REMEMBER SHE ATTACKED
THE MASAKI SHRINE.

74
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,958
EXAMINE HER FACE CAREFULLY.

75
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,583
- ( silent )

76
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,833
( laughs ) 
- ( gasps )

77
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,291
- ( Yugi laughs )

78
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,958
SASAMI.
- Sasami: YUGI!

79
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,333
- ( laughs )
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

80
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,208
THERE MUST BE SOME
KIND OF MISTAKE.

81
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,375
- Yugi: SASAMI. 
( laughs )

82
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,750
- Kid: YEAH, I'LL SEE YOU
OVER BY THE TREE.

83
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,458
- ( groans )

84
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,375
- YEAH, PERFECT.

85
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,083
THE LIGHT'S JUST RIGHT.

86
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:16,833
- ( slurps )

87
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,875
- NOW DON'T BE SO STIFF,
TENCHI.

88
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:19,875
LOOSEN UP.

89
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,541
I WANT A PICTURE
OF YOU HAVING FUN.

90
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,541
- YOU'RE MAKING ME FEEL
SELF-CONSCIOUS.

91
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,750
HOW CAN I HAVE FUN?
- OH, STOP WHINING.

92
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,208
- ( laughs )
- I WANT YOU TO SPEND

93
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,416
THE WHOLE DAY WITH ME

94
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,041
UNTIL I GET
THE PERFECT PICTURE.

95
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,708
- YUP, GREAT.  OH.

96
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,208
THAT'S A REALLY
NICE CAMERA.

97
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,791
IS IT YOUR FATHER'S?

98
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,041
- NO, IT'S MINE.
WHY DO YOU ASK? 

99
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,875
- OH, YOU NEVER
TALK ABOUT IT, 

100
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,583
BUT YOU MUST COME FROM
A PRETTY WEALTHY FAMILY.

101
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,416
- HUH?
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

102
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,333
- WELL, BECAUSE THAT
CAMERA YOU'VE GOT

103
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,250
IS ONE OF THOSE
VERY EXPENSIVE KINDS.

104
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,666
- I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
HUH.

105
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,291
- WHAT PROFESSIONS EXACTLY

106
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,791
DO YOUR MOM AND DAD
MAKE A LIVING IN?

107
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,125
IF YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING.

108
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,708
- WHY DO YOU WANT
TO KNOW THAT?

109
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,041
- WELL, WHY NOT?

110
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,916
COME TO THINK OF IT,
YOU NEVER TALK ABOUT THEM.

111
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,208
- ( laughs )
- HUH?

112
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,583
- OH, I GET IT.
YOU WANT TO GO MEET MY PARENTS.

113
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,416
AM I RIGHT?
- HUH?!

114
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,416
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT,
REALLY.

115
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,125
I WAS JUST CURIOUS.

116
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,333
- FORGET ABOUT THEM.

117
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,083
LET'S GO TAKE SOME MORE
PICTURES IN THE PARK

118
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,083
BEFORE IT GETS TOO DARK.

119
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:16,416
- HUH?  HEY, WAIT FOR ME.
I'M COMING.

120
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,750
OWW!
- ( clattering )

121
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,041
- ( gasps )

122
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,083
AH, SMILE.

123
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,541
- ( groans )

124
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,625
- HUH?

125
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,125
I DON'T GET IT.
CAN SOMEBODY EXPLAIN?

126
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,625
WHAT'S GOING ON?

127
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:31,708
- ( grunts )

128
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,166
YUGI'S STORY BEGAN
3500 YEARS AGO.

129
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,500
- Both: SINGLE-HANDEDLY,
SHE ALMOST SUCCEEDED

130
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,375
IN DESTROYING
THE JURAI PLANET.

131
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:39,666
- AND NOW SHE'S BACK,

132
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,000
THIS TIME ATTACKING
THE MASAKI FAMILY SHRINE.

133
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,291
WHAT'S WORSE, SHE'S PRETENDING
TO BE YOUR FRIEND.

134
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,333
AND I DIDN'T KNOW!

135
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,541
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

136
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:47,833
IT MUST BE A DIFFERENT PERSON.

137
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,666
YUGI WOULDN'T HARM ME
OR ANYBODY.

138
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,708
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.
SHE'S MY FRIEND.

139
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,583
SHE ONLY WANTS ME
TO BE HER FRIEND.

140
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:54,875
- SHE'S BEEN LYING TO YOU.

141
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,125
INNOCENTLY, YOU BOUGHT
INTO HER BIG, FAT LIE.

142
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,583
- IT'S NOT TRUE.
- ( meows )

143
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,166
- ( meows )

144
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,333
( whimpers )

145
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,125
- RYO-OHKI!

146
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,708
- ( meowing )

147
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:10,958
- ( clangs )

148
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,291
- ( pitiful meows )

149
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,666
- RYO-OHKI!

150
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,875
- OUR TRAPS
ARE WORKING PERFECTLY.

151
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,875
- ( laughs )
- FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW,

152
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:19,750
YOU'VE OVERDONE IT.

153
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,875
- NOW, LOOK, I'M DOING MY BEST

154
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,166
WITHOUT MIHOSHI,
KIYONE, AND TENCHI.

155
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,041
AND ALTHOUGH IT DOESN'T
REALLY MATTER MUCH,

156
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,791
RYOKO IS NOT
HERE TO HELP EITHER.

157
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,333
I ALONE MUST PROTECT
THE MASAKI FAMILY.

158
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,916
- THE PRINCESS IS RIGHT.

159
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,875
- OF COURSE, WE'LL DO
ANYTHING WE CAN TO HELP.

160
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,750
YOU CAN COUNT ON US.
- MM-HMM, MM-HMM.

161
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,666
OKAY, LET'S GO.
WE HAVE WORK TO DO.

162
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,166
WE NEED TO TEST
ANOTHER TRAP TO SEE

163
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,791
IF IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH
TO PROTECT THE WHOLE HOUSE.

164
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,000
- ( all groaning )

165
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,000
- ( clattering )

166
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,125
- ( groaning )

167
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,791
- DO YOU THINK
MY FRIEND YUGI

168
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,666
IS CAPABLE OF DOING
THE HORRIBLE THINGS

169
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,000
AYEKA CLAIMS SHE DID?

170
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,166
- Both: PRINCESS AYEKA,
CAN YOU HEAR US?

171
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,500
- Sakuya: TENCHI, 
MOVE TO THE RIGHT.

172
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,541
YOU'RE OUT OF THE LIGHT.
- UH-HUH.

173
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,541
MY RIGHT?  YOUR RIGHT?
WHICH RIGHT?

174
00:07:58,625 --> 00:07:59,833
- YOUR RIGHT.

175
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,375
TAKE A STEP BACK.
NOW DON'T MOVE.

176
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,000
- ( camera clicks )
- SORRY,

177
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,958
BUT I WASN'T SMILING
AND I THINK I BLINKED.

178
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,208
- ( laughs ) RIGHT, I BETTER
TAKE ANOTHER PICTURE.

179
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,375
- ( clicks )

180
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,666
- WHY DON'T I TAKE
YOUR PICTURE THIS TIME?

181
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,833
- I'D RATHER SEE
IF WE CAN GET

182
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,875
SOMEBODY TO TAKE A PICTURE
OF US TOGETHER.

183
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:16,875
- ( thinking )
SOONER OR LATER,

184
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,208
THOSE GUYS GOT 
TO TAKE A BREAK

185
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,416
AND THEN I MAKE MY MOVE.

186
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,375
- WHAT'S HE DOING?
- NOT MUCH OF ANYTHING.

187
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:22,875
- Sakuya: EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN.
- ( gasps )

188
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,083
- I NEED A FAVOR.
WILL YOU TAKE OUR PHOTO?

189
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,041
- Both: WHY SURE, MISS.
HAPPY TO BE OF SERVICE.

190
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,833
- OKAY, YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD.

191
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,041
- COULD YOU PLEASE 
WAIT JUST A MOMENT?

192
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,291
- HUH?
OH!

193
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,625
- MUCH BETTER.
( giggles )

194
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,333
- ( chuckles )

195
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,250
- READY FOR YOUR MUG SHOT.
- ( clicking )

196
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,125
- Both:
THANKS A LOT, FELLAS.

197
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,750
- HEY, COME GET ME.
- Both: HUH?

198
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,083
- ( laughs )
- HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

199
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,375
- Both: HUH?

200
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,000
- YOU'VE BEEN TAKING
A LOT OF SHOTS.

201
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,250
I WAS WONDERING
WHY YOU GOT

202
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,083
THIS SUDDEN INTEREST
IN PHOTOGRAPHY.

203
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:58,458
- AH, HMM.
I DON'T KNOW.

204
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,208
I SUPPOSE IT'S SOMETHING
I REALLY WANT TO DO.

205
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,750
- SAKUYA?
- YES.

206
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,083
- YOU'RE ORIGINALLY
FROM TOKYO, RIGHT? 

207
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,875
- WHY DO YOU ASK?

208
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,083
- WELL, I JUST REALIZED

209
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,833
I DON'T REALLY KNOW 
VERY MUCH ABOUT YOU.

210
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,125
LIKE, I WAS WONDERING,

211
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,416
DO YOU LIVE HERE IN TOKYO
WITH YOUR PARENTS?

212
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,083
- UH, I'M NOT SURE.

213
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,291
AH, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

214
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,625
WHY DON'T WE GO
GET ICE CREAM? 

215
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,333
- UH...
- COME ON, LET'S GO.

216
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,833
- OKAY.

217
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,750
- ( snickers ) THIS ISN'T
GONNA BE ALL THAT EASY.

218
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,666
( snickers )

219
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,500
- I MUST BE
SEEING THINGS.

220
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,625
I DON'T REMEMBER MY HOUSE
LOOKING LIKE THIS.

221
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:51,125
I GUESS THIS WILL TEACH ME
TO LEAVE WORK EARLY.

222
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,916
- THIS IS YOUR ONLY WARNING.

223
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,208
DO NOT TAKE ANOTHER STEP.

224
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,541
THIS HOUSE IS OFF-LIMITS
TO CIVILIAN PERSONNEL.

225
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:59,000
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
IT MUST BE SOME KIND OF JOKE.

226
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,125
HUH?

227
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,458
- ( explosion )
- ( screams )

228
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:04,291
- WELL, YOU CAN'T SAY I DIDN'T
TRY TO WARN YOU.

229
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,166
- Vendor: SO, SWEETIE,
IS THAT YOUNG MAN YOUR DATE?

230
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,666
- HUH?
YUP.

231
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,916
- AH, TO BE YOUNG LIKE YOU
IS WONDERFUL.

232
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,500
- I'LL BET YOU HAD
A LOT OF DATES YOURSELF

233
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,666
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG.

234
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,083
- IT WAS DIFFERENT BACK THEN.

235
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,583
YOU HAD TO BE
CHAPERONED EVERYWHERE.

236
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,875
IF YOU LIKED A GIRL,
YOU COULD NEVER BE ALONE.

237
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,833
- THAT'S AWFUL.
- YOU JUST EARNED A FREE SCOOP.

238
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,833
- WOW.
- HAVE FUN.

239
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:27,791
- WE WILL.
THANK YOU, SIR.

240
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,791
- AH, BET THEY AREN'T
EXPECTING ME

241
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,791
TO USE THE BACK DOOR.
WATCH ME FOOL 'EM.

242
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,791
AAH!
AAHH!

243
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,666
- OPEN FIRE.
INTRUDER SPOTTED.

244
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,041
- ( explosions )
- ( screaming )

245
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,541
( groaning )

246
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:40,958
- Kamidake:
INTRUDER DOWN AND OUT.

247
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,416
- ( eating loudly )

248
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,083
HMM, EATING ICE CREAM
LIKE THIS IS NICE AND COOL.

249
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,083
- ( giggles )
REALLY?

250
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,375
I BETTER TRY IT.

251
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,875
OH!
( whimpers )

252
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,125
IT'S FREEZING.
- COME ON, LET'S GO.

253
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,500
- MY WHOLE BODY
IS KIND OF STIFF AND SORE.

254
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,125
- ( giggles )

255
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:01,125
I'M SORRY IF I WAS A BIT
TOO HARD ON YOU ALL DAY.

256
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,500
- YEAH, I BET.

257
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,583
PHOTO SESSIONS ALWAYS 
TAKE A LOT OUT OF YOU.

258
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,333
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

259
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,541
- BECAUSE THAT'S
HOW IT'S BEEN

260
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,250
EVERY TIME I'VE HAD 
A GROUP PHOTO TAKEN.

261
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,333
SOMEONE ALWAYS
CLOSES HIS EYES OR MOVES.

262
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,750
THEN THE SHOT
HAS TO BE DONE OVER

263
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,208
UNTIL, FINALLY,
EVERYONE LOOKS JUST RIGHT.

264
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:19,083
SAKUYA, HAVEN'T YOU EVER
TAKEN A GROUP PHOTO BEFORE?

265
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,833
- UM...

266
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,416
I DON'T KNOW.
- HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW?

267
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,083
HAVEN'T YOU EVER
TAKEN PICTURES

268
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,083
WHEN YOU WENT ON FAMILY TRIPS
OR SCHOOL PICNICS?

269
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,208
SOMEBODY'S ALWAYS MAKING YOU
POSE FOR THE CAMERA.

270
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,250
- I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

271
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,250
- WELL, LOOK
IN YOUR PHOTO ALBUM.

272
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,250
YOU MUST HAVE AT LEAST
ONE GROUP PICTURE,

273
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,666
MAYBE A PHOTO
OF YOUR FAMILY TOGETHER.

274
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,541
- MAYBE.

275
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,750
BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER...

276
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,458
MY HOUSE, MY FAMILY,

277
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,250
NONE OF IT.

278
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,916
I DON'T KNOW.
I REALLY DON'T.

279
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,541
- SAKUYA?

280
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,666
- ( meows )

281
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,750
- Minion: DON'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT MOVING. 

282
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,833
- HEY, LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

283
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,166
- ( gasps )

284
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,208
PLEASE DON'T TAKE
THE VILLAGE TREASURE.

285
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,958
STOP.

286
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,083
( grunting )

287
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,333
( whimpers )

288
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,000
- HEY, TAKE IT EASY.

289
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,875
I'LL MAKE GOOD USE OF
YOUR TOWN'S TREASURE,

290
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,791
OLD-TIMER, DON'T YOU
WORRY ABOUT THAT.

291
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,916
- WHAT ARE YOU INTENDING
TO DO WITH IT.

292
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,583
- HMM, I CAN SELL IT
FOR A HANDSOME PRICE

293
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,291
ON THE BLACK MARKET.
- NO, I BEG YOU.

294
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,958
- I MIGHT DONATE IT
FOR TARGET PRACTICE

295
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,791
IN A SPACE SHOOTING CONTEST.

296
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,083
HOW ABOUT THIS?

297
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,208
I COULD USE IT AS AN ANCHOR
FOR MY SPACESHIP.

298
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,708
( cackles )

299
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,541
- Boy: STOP IT!

300
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,958
- ( growls )
- YOU SCUMMY SPACE PIRATE,

301
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,583
YOU CAN'T HAVE OUR
VILLAGE TREASURE. 

302
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:00,875
I WON'T LET YOU.

303
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,708
NOW YOU BETTER GIVE IT BACK
OR GET OUT OF HERE

304
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,250
BEFORE I BEAT YOU UP--
( grunts )

305
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,666
- ( gasping )

306
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,666
- YOU'RE A BRAZEN, GUTSY KID.

307
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,666
- COVER YOUR EYES, HONEY. 
I DON'T WANT YOU TO WATCH.

308
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,791
- I DON'T LIKE SNIVELING.
KNOCK IT OFF.

309
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,500
YOUR LITTLE BRAT'S 
NOT GONNA GET HURT.

310
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,416
- HUH?
DON'T CALL ME A LITTLE BRAT!

311
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,166
- ( growls )

312
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,000
JUST BACK OFF!

313
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,666
I WAS GONNA LET YOU LIVE!

314
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,875
BUT NOT ANYMORE.
NIGHTY-NIGHT.

315
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,875
- ( screams )
- Woman: OH NO!

316
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,166
- ( whimpering )

317
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,500
- DON'T STOP, RYOKO.

318
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,458
- ( strains )

319
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,416
- ( whimpers )
- ( strains )

320
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,583
- RYOKO. 
- MM-HMM.

321
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,125
- ( grunts )

322
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,750
- TENCHI.

323
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,583
- ( sirens wail )

324
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,791
- Kiyone: WE MISSED
RYOKO ONCE AGAIN.

325
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,458
WE'RE ALWAYS JUST
ONE STEP BEHIND HER, OH BOY.

326
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,583
- Mihoshi: WATCH OUT. THE
ENEMY'S COMING UP FROM BEHIND.

327
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,208
- ROTATING ALL GUN POSITIONS
TO THE REAR!

328
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,166
( growls )

329
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,583
- ( sighs )

330
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,916
- THE ENEMY'S SNEAKED UP ON HIM.
HE'S GOT HIM.

331
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,416
WHAT A COWARD YOU ARE, 
DRILL WORM BAZOOKA MAN.

332
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,583
- UGH!

333
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,083
- HOW DO YOU LIKE
THEM APPLES, COPPER?

334
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,750
HAHA, THE WHOLE UNIVERSE
IS MINE NOW.

335
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,250
- NOT SO FAST.
SEE, NOBODY OWNS OUTER SPACE,

336
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,333
NOT EVEN YOU, DRILL WORM
BAZOOKA MAN, YOU MADMAN.

337
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,916
YOU WON'T WIN!
( grunts )

338
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,791
HMM, HA HA HA,
YOU CAN'T KILL ME.

339
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,000
I'M THE MEANEST BAD MAN
IN OUTER SPACE.

340
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,750
( exaggerated groan )

341
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,041
THIS TIME
YOU'VE GOT ME GOOD.

342
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,458
- IS YOUR LITTLE
UNIVERSE SAFE AGAIN?

343
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:47,791
- WHA--

344
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,541
- 'CAUSE THIS UNIVERSE
COULD USE SOME HELP

345
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:50,625
IF YOU'RE NOT TOO BUSY.

346
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,291
- OH, PLEASE
DON'T BE MAD AT ME.

347
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,500
I WAS BORED AND I MISS
MY FAVORITE TV SHOW

348
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,125
"SPACE POLICE POLICEMAN."

349
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,500
- YOU SURE LOOK LIKE YOU 
WERE HAVING A GREAT TIME.

350
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,291
AMAZING, WHAT'D YOU DO?

351
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,916
BUY OUT AN ENTIRE TOY STORE

352
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,125
SO YOU COULD
FILL UP THE COCKPIT

353
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,750
WITH ALL YOUR
"SPACE COP" THINGS?

354
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,875
I'M GONNA THROW
THIS STUFF INTO SPACE.

355
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,250
( gasps )

356
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,000
- PLEASE DON'T THROW AWAY

357
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,458
MY "SPACE POLICE" POLICEMEN.

358
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:15,916
I WON'T PLAY WITH MY TOYS

359
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,791
MORE THAN THREE TIMES A DAY,
I PROMISE.

360
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,500
- ( sighs )
- OR MAYBE TWICE A DAY.

361
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,458
ONCE A DAY WILL BE FINE,
OKAY?

362
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,291
PLEASE, KIYONE.

363
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:27,291
- HMPH, HOW ABOUT WE VISIT 
EARTH ON OUR NEXT VACATION?

364
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,125
- WHAT?

365
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,916
YIPPEE!  OH, YAY!
LET'S DO IT.

366
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,916
I'LL GET TO WATCH
MY FAVORITE TV SHOW

367
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
AND GET TAPES OF THE ONES
I MISSED FROM SASAMI.

368
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,708
SHE'S BEEN RECORDING
THEM ALL FOR ME.

369
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,041
- ALL RIGHT.

370
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,458
WE HAVE TO GET THE CHIEF'S
APPROVAL FIRST, THOUGH.

371
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,916
- WE SHOULD START PLACING 
OUR VACATION REQUESTS NOW.

372
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,250
- ( giggles )

373
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,250
MAYBE I'LL CHECK OUT YOUR SHOW.
I MIGHT ENJOY IT.

374
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,541
- WE'LL WATCH IT TOGETHER.

375
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,166
"SPACE POLICE POLICEMAN" 
IS GREAT.

376
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,166
YOU'LL LIKE IT.
( giggles )

377
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:56,750
- ( Sakuya laughs )
- ( Tenchi laughs )

378
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,250
- BETTER CHECK
THIS ONE OUT. 

379
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,833
YOU'RE MOUTHLESS.

380
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,500
- THIS IS A REAL CHARMER TOO.
- OH!

381
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,416
( gasps )
WHAT A HORRIBLE PICTURE.

382
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,458
AH, I'D BETTER BURN
THE NEGATIVE.

383
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,375
OH!
- ( laughs )

384
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,458
( continues laughing )

385
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,666
IS ORANGE JUICE
ALL RIGHT, SAKUYA?

386
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,083
- SURE.

387
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,208
TENCHI?
- HMM?

388
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,666
- WOULD YOU LIKE
TO PUT THIS ON YOUR DESK?

389
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,250
- YUP, THANKS A LOT.

390
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:36,250
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
- NOT MUCH OF ANYTHING REALLY.

391
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,666
- OH, HUH.

392
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,583
YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT
THINKING ABOUT

393
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,750
WHAT THE GIRL FROM OKAYAMA
SAID YESTERDAY?

394
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,625
- NO, CERTAINLY NOT.
- I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

395
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,541
- WHAT?
- YOU WANT TO RUSH BACK

396
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:47,875
TO OKAYAMA RIGHT AWAY.

397
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,541
DON'T DENY IT!
IT'S TRUE.

398
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:50,833
BUT YOU PROMISED ME
THAT WE WERE

399
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,625
GOING TO SPEND THIS SUMMER
WITH EACH OTHER.

400
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,375
- ( sighs )
- BESIDES,

401
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,583
THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO

402
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,833
EVEN IF YOU DID GO BACK
TO OKAYAMA.

403
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,125
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

404
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,250
- EVERYONE IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR THEIR OWN LIVES,

405
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,791
MAKING THEIR OWN DECISIONS.

406
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,000
NOBODY CAN DICTATE
TO RYOKO OR AYEKA 

407
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,791
HOW THEY MUST
LIVE THEIR LIVES.

408
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,916
AM I RIGHT?
- YOU PROBABLY ARE,

409
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
BUT I WASN'T GOING FOR THEM.

410
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,875
- OKAYAMA'S MY HOMETOWN.

411
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,333
I JUST FEEL LIKE GOING HOME.

412
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:18,416
WELL, DON'T YOU SOMETIMES
THINK ABOUT GOING HOME, SAKUYA?

413
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,166
- I ONLY THINK ABOUT TOKYO.

414
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:25,083
ALL I KNOW IS HERE.

415
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,708
- Tenchi: ( echoes ) DO YOU LIVE
HERE IN TOKYO WITH YOUR PARENTS?

416
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,041
( echoes )
WHAT ARE THEIR PROFESSIONS?

417
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,375
( echoes )
YOU NEVER TALK ABOUT THEM.

418
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,875
( echoes ) CAN'T YOU LOOK
IN YOUR PHOTO ALBUM?

419
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,208
( echoes ) DON'T YOU HAVE
PHOTOS OF YOUR FAMILY?

420
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,750
- ( gasps )
- HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW?

421
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,916
( echoes ) TELL ME.
- ( gasping )

422
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,750
( whimpering )

423
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,000
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING...

424
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,666
ABOUT MY FAMILY.

425
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,333
NO MEMORY OF ANY KIND.

426
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,958
ALL I KNOW IS TENCHI.

427
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,375
- HEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
OH!

428
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,833
SAKUYA!  SAKUYA!
WAKE UP.

429
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,041
- ( gasps )

430
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,291
YES, TENCHI, WHAT IS IT?

431
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,000
- OH, GOOD, YOU'RE BACK.

432
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,791
SAKUYA,
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

433
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,750
- KEEP YOUR EYES ON ME.
- HUH?

434
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,041
- PLEASE LISTEN.
DON'T GO ANYWHERE.

435
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,875
BE HERE FOR ME
AND ME ONLY.

436
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,625
DON'T LOOK
AT ANYBODY ELSE.

437
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,041
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

438
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,958
- ( gasps )
TENCHI...

439
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,750
I-- I AM--

440
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:30,125
( cries )

441
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,166
- WHERE'RE YOU GOING?

442
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,083
- ( door opens )

443
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,083
( door closes )

444
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,625
- HA, EVEN THEY
WOULDN'T EXPECT

445
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,291
ANYBODY TO COME
THROUGH THIS LAKE.

446
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,333
HMM, I WONDER WHAT THIS IS.

447
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,958
- ( rattles )
- THIEF ALERT!

448
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,208
SECURITY IS READY.

449
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,875
- ( screams )

450
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:58,041
- ( explosion )
- ( screaming )

451
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,208
- SOUNDS LIKE ANOTHER SCOUNDREL
JUST GOT TRAPPED.

452
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,416
THAT'S OUR THIRD ONE.

453
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,083
- HMM.

454
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,541
- ( meows )

455
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,041
- ( thinking )
YUGI, THEY SAY

456
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,041
YOU ATTACKED
THE MASAKI SHRINE.

457
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,666
YOU DIDN'T DO THAT,
DID YOU?

458
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,375
YOU MEANT IT WHEN YOU SAID
YOU WERE FRIENDS, RIGHT?

459
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,166
I KNOW YOU DID.

460
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,666
- ( thinking ) SASAMI,
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY FRIEND.

461
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,041
YOU SHOULD MOVE TO MY PLACE.

462
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,458
WE CAN LIVE THERE TOGETHER.

463
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:25,625
- WHAT?

464
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,000
- IT'LL BE THE MOST
PERFECT FRIENDSHIP.

465
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,833
I JUST CAN'T WAIT.
- I'M SORRY, BUT

466
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,458
THAT'S A CRAZY IDEA.

467
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,458
WE CAN'T POSSIBLY
LIVE ON OUR OWN. 

468
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,041
AFTER ALL, WE'RE STILL
JUST CHILDREN.

469
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,916
- ( echoes )
DON'T YOU DISAPPOINT ME!

470
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,916
SASAMI, I'M HERE
WAITING FOR YOU.

471
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,750
WON'T YOU PLEASE
COME TO ME?

472
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,958
BECAUSE IT'S TERRIBLE
TO BE ALL ALONE.

473
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,916
MY WORLD SHALL EMERGE.
THE TIME IS APPROACHING.

474
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,291
MATARI, TSUGARU!

475
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,625
- Tsugaru: YES, MA'AM.

476
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:54,125
- LET'S MAKE PREPARATIONS.
IT'S SHOWTIME.

477
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:57,750
( cackles )

478
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,833
( laughter continues )

479
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,708
- ( alarm rings )

480
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,041
- ( pulsing )

481
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,000
- Both: HUH?
( screams ) 

482
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,333
- ( Yugi laughing )

483
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:32,583
( laughter continues )

484
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:37,958
- ( sighs )

485
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,250
HMM.

486
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:53,291
- MY HOME, MY FAMILY,

487
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,500
MY MEMORY,

488
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,458
I DON'T HAVE ANY
OF THESE THINGS.

489
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:00,625
IF TENCHI CAN RECALL
THE HOMETOWN WHERE HE GREW UP

490
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,625
AND HIS FAMILY
THAT LIVES THERE,

491
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,166
THEN I SHOULD HAVE A MEMORY
OF MY OWN FAMILY

492
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,583
AND A HOME SOMEWHERE TOO.

493
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,166
BUT I JUST DON'T.

494
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,833
IT'S ALL BLANK.

495
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,041
I CAN'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING IN MY LIFE

496
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,875
BEFORE I MET TENCHI.

497
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,458
BUT HOW CAN THAT BE?

498
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:21,125
WHY CAN'T I REMEMBER?

499
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:27,750
( cries )

500
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:31,041
TENCHI, PLEASE HELP.

501
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,375
PLEASE HELP ME, TENCHI.

502
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,833
YOU'RE THE ONLY
ONE WHO CAN.

503
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,208
HELP ME.

504
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,083
- ( theme music plays )

505
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:09,083
- ( singing in Japanese )

506
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:06,041
- ( meowing )

507
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,041
( meows )

508
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,083
- Ayeka:
AYEKA HERE.

509
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:15,291
RYOKO HAS GONE
TO OUTER SPACE

510
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:16,916
AND DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE COMING BACK.

511
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,916
KIYONE AND MIHOSHI
HAVE GONE TO PLUTO

512
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,541
AND THEY DON'T SEEM
TO BE COMING BACK. 

513
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:22,541
AND LORD TENCHI HAS GONE
TO TOKYO

514
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:24,958
AND HE DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE COMING BACK EITHER.

515
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:27,125
TALK ABOUT BEING
LEFT BEHIND.

516
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:28,458
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

517
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:29,583
I KNOW.

518
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:30,958
IT'S UP TO ME
TO KEEP OUR HOME SAFE

519
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,916
WHILE LORD TENCHI IS AWAY.

520
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,583
ALL RIGHT, NOW
I'M READY FOR ACTION.

521
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:38,833
