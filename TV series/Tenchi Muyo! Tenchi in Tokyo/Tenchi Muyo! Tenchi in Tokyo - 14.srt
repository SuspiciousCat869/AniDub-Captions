1
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,083
- ( theme music plays )

2
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:47,291
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,458
- TV Announcer: THE LONG,
SHINING TAILS DEVELOP

4
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,791
AS THEY ORBIT THE SUN.
THESE TWIN COMETS

5
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,833
ARE CALLED
THE MANUKETA COMETS.

6
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,708
THEY'RE NAMED AFTER MR.--
- Washu: WOW.

7
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,208
- Mihoshi: I WISH I
COULD RIDE ON ONE.

8
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,333
- Kiyone: WOULDN'T IT
BE AMAZING?

9
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:36,375
LOOK!

10
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,291
- HOW CAN YOU SIT AROUND
WATCHING TV

11
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,541
AT A CRUCIAL
TIME LIKE THIS?

12
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,750
- Mihoshi: AYEKA, CHILL OUT.

13
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,791
IT'S TIME WE DID
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

14
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,041
WE MUST ACT NOW.

15
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,833
WE CANNOT SIMPLY
IGNORE IT!

16
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,375
- IGNORE WHAT?
- ARE YOU ALL BRAIN-DEAD?

17
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:56,875
I'M TALKING ABOUT TENCHI

18
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,916
AND HIS SUSPICIOUS
ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP

19
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,458
WITH THAT AWFUL GIRL SAKUYA.

20
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:01,625
DON'T YOU REMEMBER

21
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,250
WE HAD TO PUT OFF
OUR INVESTIGATION

22
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,333
UNTIL WE TOOK CARE OF
THAT STRANGE GIRL YUGI

23
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,666
WHO ATTACKED US?

24
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,708
WELL, NOW IT'S TIME
TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT.

25
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,166
- HOW DO YOU PLAN TO CARRY OUT
THE INVESTIGATION?

26
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,291
- WE'LL ALL TRAVEL TO TOKYO
TO SEE TENCHI

27
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,000
AND GET THE STORY 
DIRECTLY FROM HIM.

28
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,125
- THAT'S NO BIG DEAL.

29
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,458
WE'LL USE THE
DIMENSIONAL TUNNEL.

30
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:18,916
- I'M AFRAID
THE DIMENSION TUNNEL'S

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,125
STILL OUT OF ORDER.

32
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,875
AND IT'LL TAKE ME ALL DAY
TO FIX IT.

33
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,125
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME?!
NOW I'M UPSET!

34
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,750
HONORABLE FATHER
MESSED THIS UP. 

35
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,333
SO WE'LL JUST BORROW
MONEY FROM HIM

36
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,041
TO TRAVEL TO TOKYO
BY BULLET TRAIN.

37
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,708
- Washu: SORRY.  HE SPLIT.

38
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,875
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY THAT, HUH?

39
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,416
- I FOUND HIS NOTE
THIS MORNING.

40
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,375
- Noboyuki:
"I'M GOING ON A TRIP.

41
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,333
PLEASE DON'T TRY AND
FIND ME. NOBOYUKI."

42
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:42,083
- HE RAN AWAY
AND LEFT US STRANDED HERE!

43
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,541
YOU BUILD US A FLYING MACHINE.

44
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,041
IT'LL ONLY TAKE YOU
THREE SECONDS.

45
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,208
- I CAN'T AFFORD
TO TAKE THE TIME

46
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,625
TO DO THAT
RIGHT NOW, ALL RIGHT?

47
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,791
I'VE GOT SOME
IMPORTANT RESEARCH.

48
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,791
I NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT GEM POWER IS

49
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,166
BEFORE WE FACE
THAT GIRL AGAIN.

50
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,500
- WAIT, DON'T YOU
TAKE OFF TOO.

51
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,041
- IT'S TIME FOR US
TO GO OUT ON PATROL.

52
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,958
- DO WE HAVE TO?
- OF COURSE.

53
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,625
IT'S OUR DUTY.
WE'RE THE GALAXY POLICE.

54
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,291
NOW COME ON.
LET'S GET GOING.

55
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,916
- RIGHT NOW?
- SORRY, AYEKA, BUT DUTY CALLS.

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,083
- WAIT UP!
I'M BEING CALLED TOO.

57
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,625
- ( growling )

58
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,958
THAT JUST LEAVES US.

59
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,958
THERE'S NO CHOICE
BUT TO HAVE YOU ACCOMPANY ME.

60
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,125
RIGHT?

61
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,958
( gasps )
RYOKO, LET'S GO.

62
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,666
- I'M NOT GOING WITH YOU.

63
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,916
- WHY NOT?

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
- WELL, BECAUSE...

65
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,250
( silent )

66
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,666
- ( silent )

67
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,333
I DON'T NEED TO 
CHECK UP ON HIM.

68
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:38,583
I TRUST HIM.

69
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,000
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

70
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,250
RYOKO, HOW CAN YOU
DO THIS TO ME?

71
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,125
ALL RIGHT, FINE!
RUN OUT ON ME!

72
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,125
I'LL GET TO TOKYO MYSELF,
YOU'LL SEE!

73
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:50,166
THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M OFF TO BE WITH TENCHI.

74
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,000
( groans )

75
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,000
I JUST REMEMBERED
I DON'T EVEN HAVE

76
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,000
ENOUGH MONEY FOR
A CHEAP BUS TICKET.

77
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,333
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

78
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,791
- Sasami:
ARE YOU OKAY, RYO-OHKI?

79
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,083
- ( meowing )
- HUH?

80
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,083
HEY, SASAMI.

81
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,708
- NO, RYO-OHKI 
CAN'T TAKE YOU.

82
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,000
SHE'S NOT FEELING WELL!

83
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,958
- ( growls )
- OH, SORRY.

84
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,458
OH.

85
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,291
- TV Announcer:
WE'RE TALKING TO WORLD-TRAVELER

86
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,750
GANTETSU SARUMOTO.

87
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,375
IS IT TRUE YOU
LOST YOUR WALLET

88
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,083
ON YOUR LAST TRIP,
MR. SARUMOTO?

89
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,875
- I SURE DID, AND WITHOUT
IT, I DIDN'T HAVE

90
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,375
A CREDIT CARD
OR ANY MONEY.

91
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:21,541
- HMM? HUH?

92
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,041
- I MANAGED TO FINISH THE TRIP

93
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,916
BY HITCHHIKING
THE REST OF THE WAY.

94
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,375
I MET SUCH NICE PEOPLE
WHO GAVE ME RIDES.

95
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,000
I'M SO TOUCHED
BY THEIR KINDNESS.

96
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,000
( sniffs )

97
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,500
- HITCHHIKING!

98
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,916
THAT'S IT!
MY TRANSPORTATION SOLUTION!

99
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:40,541
- YAY! THIS IS THE LAST ROOM
WE HAVE TO CLEAN UP.

100
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,208
( gasps )

101
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,916
- WE'RE LEAVING NOW.
- BUT WHERE ARE WE GOING?

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,833
- TO SEE TENCHI.
- ( gasps )

103
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,916
- ( meows )

104
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:59,583
- WHY DON'T YOU AND I  FIND A
WAY TO HELP HER GET TO TOKYO?

105
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,041
- Tsugaru:
BUT WHY?

106
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:06,208
- TO SHOW HER
THE HAPPY COUPLE.

107
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:09,125
IT'LL SERVE MY PURPOSES
BETTER THAN

108
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,416
ANY OTHER CHEAP TRICKS
TO DESTROY THE BONDS OF TRUST

109
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,916
AMONG THE MASAKI FAMILY.

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,833
- DON'T TROUBLE YOURSELF
WITH THIS TASK.

111
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,083
YOU'RE STILL RECOVERING
FROM YOUR LAST BATTLE. 

112
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,500
LET ME HANDLE IT.

113
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:19,791
I KNOW SOMETHING WE CAN USE

114
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:22,041
AND IT HAPPENS TO BE
HANGING AROUND RIGHT NOW.

115
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,583
I'LL PUT IT
TO WORK FOR US.

116
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:24,958
IT'LL BE FUN.

117
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,125
- HI!

118
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,916
- I DON'T LIKE DOING THIS.

119
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,291
THIS IS EMBARRASSING.

120
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,833
- ( honking )

121
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,958
- GET READY.
HERE COMES ANOTHER ONE.

122
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,291
HI, HELLO, THERE.

123
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,583
COULD YOU
GIVE US A RIDE?

124
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,250
- ( coughing )

125
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,375
- HI.

126
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,500
- ( tires screech )

127
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,000
- ( car doors open )

128
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,500
- HEY, WHAT'S A BABE LIKE YOU
DOING HITCHHIKING?

129
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,625
LOSE YOUR LITTLE FRIEND
AND COME PARTY WITH REAL MEN.

130
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,083
- YEAH, LET'S GO.

131
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:05,416
- Both: ( scream )
- NOW SCRAM!

132
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,333
- Both: OH, LET'S
GET OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW!

133
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,250
- HI.

134
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,333
- ( car stops )

135
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,375
- UH-OH.

136
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,208
- Both: SORRY, MY MISTAKE.

137
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:18,000
- HI.

138
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,291
- Seniors: ( chattering )

139
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,625
- BABY, YOU CAN WAIVE AT ME
ANY OLD TIME.

140
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,583
- SHE'D BE A PERFECT BRIDE
FOR MY GRANDSON.

141
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,083
- HI.

142
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,958
- WHY IS SHE WAIVING AT US?

143
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,125
- DON'T KNOW, BUT SHE'LL NEVER
GET A RIDE LIKE THAT.

144
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,583
- TRY HARDER!

145
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,000
WIGGLE YOUR THUMB
AND STICK YOUR LEG OUT TOO.

146
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,458
- ( laughs )

147
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:41,875
( thinking ) 
LITTLE BRATS.

148
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,541
- Sasami:
WE MIGHT AS WELL QUIT.

149
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,875
WE'D BETTER FACE IT.

150
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,208
WE'RE JUST NOT GONNA GET
FROM OKAYAMA TO TOKYO

151
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,541
BY HITCHHIKING.
- HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

152
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,416
- THE POWER OF
MY LOVE FOR TENCHI

153
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,041
WILL TAKE US ANYWHERE
WE WANT TO GO,

154
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,458
EVEN THE MOON. DON'T DOUBT
IT FOR A MINUTE, UNDERSTAND?

155
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,291
- ( motor runs )

156
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,375
- I'LL NEVER GIVE UP,
YOU HEAR ME?

157
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,125
NEVER!

158
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,000
- ( laughs )

159
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,666
- Masayo:
NEED A RIDE TO TOKYO?

160
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,083
- Both: HUH?

161
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,083
( gasps )

162
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,958
- WANT A RIDE?
- OH YES.

163
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:36,083
YES, BUT WILL YOU TAKE US
EVEN IF WE DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY?

164
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,750
- WELL, HOP ABOARD.

165
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,791
- ( speaks French )

166
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,625
- I DON'T EVEN SPEAK FRENCH.

167
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,875
- ( engine runs )

168
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,333
- HERE WE GO.
- GOOD.

169
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,583
( thinking ) IT WON'T BE
LONG NOW. I'M ON MY WAY.

170
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,583
JUST WAIT FOR ME,
TENCHI, PLEASE?

171
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,083
- GOOD, IT WORKED.

172
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,833
WAIT, I MADE TWO.

173
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,541
I WONDER WHERE
THE OTHER ONE WENT.

174
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:04,958
OH WELL.

175
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,166
- Joe:
HAHAHA, I'M JOE RIDER,

176
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,791
THE FASTEST THING
ON TWO WHEELS.

177
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,125
NOBODY BEATS ME
AND MY SUPER-CYCLE.

178
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,916
- ( Sasami screams )
- HUH?

179
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,041
WHAT WAS THAT?

180
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,125
- Ayeka and Sasami:
( screams )

181
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,041
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY PASSED ME
LIKE THAT.

182
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:27,625
- I HOPE YOU'VE GOT INSURANCE
FOR THIS THING!

183
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,500
- IT'S FANTASTIC.

184
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:33,083
- THEY CALL ME
KEN THE SPEED DEMON

185
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,958
BECAUSE NOBODY MOVES
FASTER THAN ME.

186
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,833
( laughs )
- ( screams )

187
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,083
- WHOA!

188
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,375
- ( screaming )

189
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,416
- I'M COMING, TENCHI.

190
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,791
DON'T FALL IN LOVE
WITH THAT GIRL.

191
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,083
I'LL BE ARRIVING ON YOUR
DOORSTEP ANY MINUTE NOW.

192
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,916
- ( bells ring )

193
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,333
- Sakuya:
WOW, THAT'S GREAT.

194
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,666
- HUH?

195
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,958
- I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE
SUCH A GOOD ARTIST.

196
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,166
- THANKS, I ALWAYS LIKE
DRAWING THINGS.

197
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,041
I MUST GET THAT
FROM MY DAD.

198
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,500
- WHAT IS IT?

199
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,291
- I CAN'T SAY YET.
IT'S NOT FINISHED.

200
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,000
- I CAN WAIT.
- IT MIGHT BE A LONG WAIT.

201
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,666
( chuckles )

202
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,208
- ( giggles )
- ( laughs ) 

203
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,666
- PUT THE PEDDLE TO THE METAL!
LET US FLY!

204
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,166
I'M COMING, TENCHI.

205
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,375
- ( meows )

206
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,791
- ( meows )

207
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,708
-  ( birds twitter )

208
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,750
- SASAMI, WHATEVER YOU'RE
COOKING SURE SMELLS GOOD.

209
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:52,916
HUH?

210
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,458
- SASAMI'S NOT HERE.

211
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:55,541
SHE WENT WITH AYEKA.

212
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,041
- I'M HUNGRY.

213
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,500
- WELL, DON'T LOOK AT ME.

214
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,500
I'M NOT COOKING FOR ANYONE
BUT MYSELF RIGHT NOW.

215
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,666
THE KITCHEN'S ALL YOURS.

216
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,500
I'M GOING TO EAT
IN MY ROOM.

217
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:06,666
( sighs )

218
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,333
I GUESS I'LL HAVE
TO COOK FOR MYSELF.

219
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,875
- ( sighs )

220
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,708
I THOUGHT I WAS DEAD.

221
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,416
- HERE YOU ARE
BEING SO KIND TO US

222
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,750
AND WE DON'T EVEN
KNOW YOUR NAME.

223
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:19,875
YOU ARE?

224
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,291
- MASAYO, MASAYO MANUKETA.

225
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,083
- MY NAME'S AYEKA

226
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,666
AND THIS IS
MY LITTLE SISTER...

227
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,291
- SASAMI'S THE NAME.

228
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,916
- WHY'RE YOU
GOING TO TOKYO?

229
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,166
- ( Ayeka cries )

230
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,625
I'M SO GLAD YOU ASKED.

231
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,791
I'M INVOLVED IN
A HEART-WRENCHING,

232
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,875
TEAR-JERKING,
LONG-DISTANCE LOVE STORY

233
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,083
THAT I'VE JUST BEEN DYING
TO TELL SOMEBODY ABOUT.

234
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,458
- HERE SHE GOES AGAIN.

235
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,750
- I GAVE MY HEART
TO THIS WONDERFUL BOY

236
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,250
AND HOPE TO
ONE DAY MARRY HIM.

237
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,458
HIS NAME IS TENCHI MASAKI.

238
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:54,083
HE LEFT HOME
TO STUDY IN TOKYO

239
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:57,375
IN ORDER TO BECOME A BRIDE-GROOM
FIT FOR A PRINCESS.

240
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,250
OH, IT IS SUCH A TRAGEDY.

241
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,125
I CAN HARDLY GET
THE WORDS OUT.

242
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,333
IN TOKYO, THERE WAS A WICKED
SERPENT-LIKE GIRL

243
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:04,791
WAITING TO CATCH HIM.

244
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,125
SAKUYA THE STALKER
MUDDLED HIS MIND

245
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,541
AND USED HER WITCHY POWERS
TO TAKE HIM AWAY FROM ME. 

246
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,500
SHE TRICKED HIM AND NOW HE'S
COMPLETELY UNDER HER CONTROL.

247
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,291
I COULDN'T JUST SIT BY
AND DO NOTHING

248
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,541
WHILE HE WAS DESTROYED.

249
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,250
SO I LEFT HOME AND
STARTED HITCHHIKING

250
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,000
TO SAVE MY FUTURE HUSBAND.

251
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,791
- TO PUT IT SIMPLY,

252
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,375
SHE'S GONNA SEE FOR HERSELF
HOW HE TRULY FEELS ABOUT HER

253
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,791
BECAUSE SHE LOVES
HIM SO MUCH.

254
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:31,750
- IT'S ALWAYS BETTER TO KNOW
THAN TO BE IN THE DARK.

255
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,625
- GOSH, IT SEEMS TO ME

256
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,625
LIKE YOU'RE ALSO
IN LOVE WITH SOMEBODY.

257
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,791
- YEAH, HIS NAME IS ISAO,

258
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,291
ISAO KETAUCHI.

259
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,583
NO ONE CAN BEAT HIM.
HE'S SO FAST.

260
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,916
- OH, MISS MASAYO,
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND YOU.

261
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,625
GIVING RIDES TO HITCHHIKERS
REALLY HELPS YOU PASS THE TIME,

262
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,708
BUT YOUR REAL OBJECTIVE
ON THE ROAD OF LIFE

263
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,666
IS TO CATCH UP WITH
THE MAN YOU TRULY LOVE.

264
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,166
- YOU'RE WRONG.

265
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,333
MASAYO NEVER SAID THAT.

266
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,791
OH NO!

267
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:57,916
THERE SHE GOES.

268
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,041
SHE'S OFF IN HER
FANTASY WORLD AGAIN.

269
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,458
- THE MAN YOU LOVE IS THE
FASTEST MAN IN THE UNIVERSE.

270
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,041
NO ONE ON THE ROAD

271
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,875
HAS COME CLOSE TO
MATCHING HIS SPEED.

272
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,708
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN
SO FAR OUT IN FRONT,

273
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:10,750
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THAT
YOU'RE RIGHT BEHIND HIM. 

274
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,541
BUT YOU'VE NEVER GIVEN UP.

275
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:18,500
YOU'VE SPENT HOURS AND HOURS
UPGRADING YOUR CYCLE.

276
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,500
AND FINALLY YOU ACHIEVED
THE POWER TO MATCH HIS. 

277
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,000
AND NOW YOU TRAVEL
AROUND THE WORLD

278
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,041
HOPING TO FIND HIM

279
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,458
SO YOU CAN BE SIDE BY SIDE
FOREVER.

280
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,583
- THAT IS ENOUGH!

281
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,708
- I'M VERY DEEPLY MOVED
BY YOUR STORY.

282
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,750
IT'S SO ROMANTIC, MASAYO.

283
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,958
- WHAT'S WRONG?

284
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,208
HOPE YOU'RE
NOT OFFENDED.

285
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,041
( whimpers )

286
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:49,000
- ( gasps )
- ( fluttering )

287
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,416
- THANK YOU.

288
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,791
YOU ARE THE FIRST
AND ONLY PERSON

289
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,541
TO EVER TRULY 
UNDERSTAND ME.

290
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,000
- YES, WE ARE ALIKE.
- FRIENDS FOREVER.

291
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,250
- MASAYO.
- AYEKA. 

292
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,500
- MASAYO.

293
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,208
- YOU'RE BONDING IN
THE SISTERHOOD

294
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,875
OF WOMEN IN LOVE.

295
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,208
WE BETTER TELL
EVERYBODY THE NEWS!

296
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,708
- ( chatter )
- I SAW HIM! 

297
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,083
ISAO'S RACING AGAIN.

298
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,625
WELL, DID YOU
COMPETE WITH ISAO?

299
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,708
- YEAH, BUT I WAS
NO MATCH FOR HIM.

300
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,625
- ( rumbling )
- ( panting )

301
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,166
- ( muttering )
- THE MYSTERIOUS ISAO

302
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,500
HAS SURFACED LIKE A WHIRLWIND
FROM NOWHERE.

303
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,416
NO ONE HAS ANY IDEA
WHO HE IS.

304
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,583
- HE'S AWESOME.
THERE'S NOBODY LIKE HIM.

305
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,583
- ( rumbling )
- ( panting )

306
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:27,916
- SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

307
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,541
HE THE ONE
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?

308
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,458
WHERE ARE YOU?
MASAYO? AYEKA?

309
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:33,750
- I HEARD HIM COMING
ALTHOUGH I NEVER... 

310
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,083
GOT A GLIMPSE OF
ANYTHING BUT DUST.

311
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,166
- WHERE'S ISAO?
- HUH? WHAT?

312
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,416
WHO ARE YOU?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

313
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,291
- TELL ME!

314
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,375
- AAH.

315
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,000
LADY, I CAN'T BE SURE,

316
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,958
BUT HE'S PROBABLY STILL
CRUISING AROUND OUT THERE.

317
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,333
I MEAN, HE WAS DOING
FIVE LAPS TO MY ONE.

318
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:48,958
( sighs )

319
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,000
- MASAYO, WAIT.

320
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,125
- HEY, WHERE DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE GOING?

321
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,333
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE
THE GIRLS WITH YOU.

322
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,458
- GOT TO FIND ISAO.

323
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,291
YOU ARE A KOMABITO.

324
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,166
DON'T EVER FORGET THAT.

325
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,291
I ORDER YOU TO TAKE
THE GIRLS TO TOKYO 

326
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,916
JUST AS FAST AS YOU CAN.

327
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,458
GOT THAT?

328
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,166
- HM-HMM.
- Ayeka: MASAYO!

329
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,708
- REMEMBER YOUR 
MISSION, MASAYO.

330
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,416
- HEY, MASAYO, DON'T
LEAVE WITHOUT US.

331
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,208
- I WISH I COULD.

332
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,416
- WHAT'S BOTHERING HER?

333
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,291
- ( meows )

334
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,166
- SOMETHING'S
COMING THIS WAY.

335
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,166
- ( rumbling )

336
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,416
- WHAT EVER IT IS,
IT'S NOISY.

337
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,166
- IT'S HIM.

338
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,958
- ( rumbling )

339
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,208
- ISAO!

340
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,125
- WHAT? HOW DO YOU KNOW
IT'S HIM?

341
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,958
ALL I SEE
IS A PILE OF DUST.

342
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,833
- I CAN ALWAYS RECOGNIZE HIM.

343
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:54,333
OUT OF SIGHT, BUT NEVER
OUT OF MY HEART, DEAREST ONE.

344
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,166
AH, COME ON.

345
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,458
BETTER GET YOU TO TOKYO.

346
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,750
- DON'T YOU WANT TO
CATCH UP WITH ISAO?

347
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,250
- IT'S OKAY.

348
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,666
- NOT REALLY. YOUR DEAREST
LOVE IS GETTING AWAY

349
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,208
FROM YOU AGAIN.  HOW COULD--
- I SAID IT'S OKAY!

350
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,291
FORGET IT.
I HAVE TO TAKE YOU TO TOKYO

351
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,208
AND I KNOW YOU'RE
IN A HURRY TO GET THERE.

352
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,708
- THAT'S TRUE. ALL THAT I'VE
BEEN ABLE TO THINK ABOUT

353
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,625
FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS
IS GETTING TO TOKYO

354
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,708
AND SEEING TENCHI.
- AYEKA.

355
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,916
- LUCKILY, HE'S NOT RUNNING
AROUND THE WORLD

356
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,583
SO IT SHOULDN'T BE
TOO HARD TO FIND HIM.

357
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:23,500
SO LET'S GO.

358
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,708
WE'LL FIND ISAO
WHILE THE TRAIL IS HOT.

359
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,208
- YOU MEAN IT?
- TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

360
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,708
I'M STARTING TO GET COLD FEET
ABOUT GOING TO TOKYO.

361
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,708
YOU SEE,
I'M A LITTLE FRIGHTENED.

362
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,041
TENCHI MAY NOT EVEN FEEL
THE SAME WAY ABOUT ME.

363
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,708
AFTER ALL, HE MAY
REALLY BE IN LOVE

364
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,833
WITH THAT GIRL SAKUYA,
YOU KNOW.

365
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,583
I'M NOT SURE I HAVE THE COURAGE
TO SEE HIM NOW.

366
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,666
BUT I DON'T FEEL
SO ALONE ANYMORE

367
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,041
SINCE I FOUND OUT WE SHARE
A SIMILAR PROBLEM.

368
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,583
I KNOW YOU HAVE THE COURAGE
TO FIND THE ONE YOU LOVE.

369
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,541
AND I WANT TO HELP YOU
IN YOUR MISSION.

370
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,416
AT THE SAME TIME,
YOU'LL BE HELPING ME

371
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,458
GET UP THE COURAGE
TO GO AFTER MY TENCHI.

372
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,541
SO LET'S GO AFTER YOUR ISAO.

373
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,500
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

374
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,458
- ( engine runs )

375
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,458
- ( screams )

376
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,375
- LET'S GO!

377
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,375
- ISAO!
- ( screams )

378
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,375
- ( panting )
- ( rumbling )

379
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,791
- THAT'S ISAO.
- ( panting ) 

380
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,250
- Sasami:
I THOUGHT HE WAS A BIKER.

381
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,041
- RUNNING IS ALL HE HAS
EVER WANTED TO DO.

382
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,875
- LOOK, ISAO, MASAYO'S
RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

383
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,833
- HE CAN'T HEAR YOU.
HE'S FOCUSED ON FUNNING.

384
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,541
- THERE'S ONE WAY
TO GET HIS ATTENTION.

385
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,625
GO FASTER THAN HIM.

386
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,541
GO!

387
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,958
GO!

388
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,375
GO!

389
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,625
GO!

390
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,333
- ( meows )
- ( screams )

391
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:57,916
- ( panting )

392
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:02,250
- WE DON'T SEEM TO BE GETTING
ANY CLOSER TO HIM.

393
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,750
WE NEED TO FIND A WAY
TO SPEED UP.

394
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,625
- PLEASE LET ME
GET OFF THIS THING.

395
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,375
- HOW CAN YOU THINK
OF DESERTING MASAYO

396
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,666
WHEN SHE NEEDS US THE MOST?!

397
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,708
I'VE GOT IT.

398
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,125
THE BIKE WILL BE LIGHTER

399
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,750
AND GO MUCH FASTER WITHOUT US.

400
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,666
SASAMI, RYO-OHKI, OFF!

401
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,375
- OH, GREAT.  YES.

402
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,208
LET'S GET OFF.
LET'S GET OFF NOW!

403
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,875
BUT HOW?

404
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,833
WE'RE MOVING TOO FAST.

405
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,208
- GET READY, MASAYO.
- GOT YOU.

406
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,208
- ( panting )

407
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,083
( grunts )

408
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,041
- ( grunts )

409
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,625
- OKAY, JUMP.
- OH!

410
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:44,833
- ( all scream )

411
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,791
- COMING UP BEHIND YOU, ISAO.

412
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,750
- ( panting )
- ISAO!

413
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,666
HEY, ISAO!

414
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,875
IT'S ME, HEYYY!
- ( panting )

415
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:57,875
( gasps )
MASAYO!

416
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:03,833
- ( gasps )

417
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:04,875
- ( screams )

418
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,583
- ( meows )

419
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,541
- THANKS, RYO-OHKI.

420
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,000
WONDER WHAT HAPPENED
TO MASAYO.

421
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,333
- Ayeka: MASAYO!

422
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:18,000
- THANK YOU SO MUCH,
AYEKA AND SASAMI.

423
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,666
NOW ISAO AND I
CAN GO BACK TO OUR COMETS.

424
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,375
- COMETS?

425
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,708
- I WISH THAT YOU BOTH 
HAVE A VERY HAPPY LIFE.

426
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,250
- GOOD-BYE NOW.

427
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,666
DON'T GIVE UP, AYEKA.

428
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,625
- I PROMISE I WON'T.

429
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,875
GOOD-BYE, DEAR FRIEND.

430
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,583
I'M GOING TO FIND OUT

431
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,208
HOW TENCHI REALLY
FEELS ABOUT ME.

432
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,375
THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME
THE INSPIRATION.

433
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,958
- SO THOSE COMETS WERE LOVERS,
NOT TWINS, HUH.

434
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,416
I THOUGHT I WAS MAKING BIKERS
OUT OF BOTH OF THEM.

435
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,083
I DON'T KNOW
HOW THAT KOMABITO

436
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,833
TURNED OUT TO BE
A CROSS-COUNTRY RUNNER.

437
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,791
- ( sighs )
BUT WHERE ARE WE?

438
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,916
- APPARENTLY,
WE'RE IN SENDAI.

439
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,750
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"IN SENDAI"?!

440
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,625
WHERE IN THE WORLD IS THAT?!

441
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:11,041
I WANT TO KNOW WHICH
WAY TO GO TO TOKYO! 

442
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,708
- WE PASSED TOKYO A WAYS BACK.

443
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,666
WE WERE GOING SO FAST,
WE MISSED IT.

444
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,625
- ( meows )
- I'M NOT LETTING

445
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,541
THIS LITTLE MIS-CALCULATION
STOP ME.

446
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:19,958
I'M TELLING YOU
I'LL GET TO TOKYO

447
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,291
EVEN IF I HAVE
TO HITCHHIKE THERE

448
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,916
ALL THE WAY FROM AMERICA.

449
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,500
COME ON, SASAMI, LET'S GO.

450
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,166
TOKYO OR BUST!

451
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,333
- THAT'S ENOUGH WORK
FOR TONIGHT.

452
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:35,791
- ( doorbell rings )
- HUH?

453
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,083
WHO'S THAT?
NO ONE VISITS THIS LATE.

454
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,416
( gasps )
- ( groans )

455
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,875
- Tenchi: AYEKA?!
- ( groans )

456
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,750
- AND SASAMI TOO!

457
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,166
GOSH, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

458
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,250
YOU BOTH LOOK AWFUL.

459
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,333
- ( sighs )

460
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,125
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

461
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,000
( sighs )

462
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,666
- ( slurps ) 
- ( banging )

463
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,083
- GOLLY, SURE TOOK
THEM LONG ENOUGH. 

464
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,375
- ( light breathing )

465
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,500
- WHAT COULD THEY 
HAVE DONE IN TOKYO

466
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:10,875
THAT WIPED THEM OUT
LIKE THAT?

467
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,666
- ( giggle )

468
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,125
- YEESH, SHE'S OUT
LIKE A LIGHT.

469
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,666
MAKE SURE YOU TELL ME
IN THE MORNING

470
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,333
EXACTLY WHAT YOU DID.

471
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,375
NIGHTY-NIGHT FOR NOW.

472
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,083
( yawns )

473
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:33,166
- MASAYO, MAY YOU
ALWAYS BE HAPPY. 

474
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,583
- ( theme music plays )

475
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,750
