1
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,791
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,500
- Sasami: RYOKO,
OPEN THE DOOR.

3
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,500
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
- I'M NOT HERE.

4
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,458
- I'M HERE TO COLLECT
YOUR SHARE OF CONTRIBUTION

5
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,166
TO OUR LIVING EXPENSES.
- I SAID I'M NOT HERE.

6
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,583
- YOU CAN'T SKIP THE PAYMENT
LIKE LAST MONTH.

7
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,583
- HOW CAN I PAY
THE MONEY I DON'T HAVE?

8
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,000
- MEOW.
- Sasami: NOT AGAIN.

9
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,708
- I'M A SPACE PIRATE.

10
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:20,791
STEALING'S MY BAG.
PAYING'S A DRAG.

11
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:24,166
BESIDES, I'M QUITE BUSY
RIGHT NOW, CAN'T BE DISTURBED.

12
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,541
- OH.

13
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:26,875
OH, BROTHER.

14
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:29,083
SHE'S BUSY.
LET'S GO.

15
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,375
- ( groans )

16
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,708
- MEOW, MEOW.
MEOW, MEOW, MEOW.

17
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:36,833
- Sasami: I KNOW, BUT DON'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS TO TENCHI.

18
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,583
- I GUESS I'VE GOT TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

19
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,875
I'LL CONCENTRATE
ON MONEY.

20
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,208
NEED MONEY.

21
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,791
- Ayeka: I DON'T KNOW
WHERE IT WENT--

22
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,166
ON LIPSTICK, HAIRSPRAY?
WHO KNOWS?

23
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,458
IT'S A NIGHTMARE.

24
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,458
SORRY, MY MONEY
UP AND DISAPPEARED.

25
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,500
- YOU CAN'T PAY YOUR SHARE
THIS MONTH EITHER?

26
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,916
OH, PLEASE.

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,458
EVEN JUST A LITTLE BIT
WILL BE A GREAT HELP.

28
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,083
- I HAVE NO MONEY, SASAMI.
YOU'LL HAVE TO BE PATIENT.

29
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,583
- ( snoring )
- MIHOSHI.

30
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:15,583
- WELL, LOOKS LIKE
IT'S UP TO ME TO FIND THE MONEY.

31
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,583
- ( laughs )

32
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,708
YAY!  THANKS A LOT, SASAMI!

33
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,791
( laughs )
THAT'S SO KIND OF YOU.

34
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,458
- OH.

35
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,166
MIGHT AS WELL MAKE BREAKFAST
WHILE I THINK.

36
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,166
COME ON RYO-OHKI.

37
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,875
- MEOW, MEOW.

38
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,500
- ( door opens and closes )
- I'LL JUST HAVE TO PULL MONEY

39
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,166
OUT OF THE FOOD BUDGET,
RYO-OHKI.

40
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,791
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE ELSE TO CUT.

41
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,458
FROM NOW ON, WE'LL ALL
HAVE TO GO WITHOUT LUNCH.

42
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:39,666
- MEOW?
- YEAH,

43
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,625
EVERYONE WILL HAVE TO
TIGHTEN THEIR BELTS.

44
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:42,916
- NO WAY.
- HUH?

45
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,333
- MONEY TALK
MAKES ME REAL MAD.

46
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,583
COME ON!

47
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,750
- ( grunting )

48
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,833
- AS A FUTURE WIFE
IN THE MASAKI FAMILY,

49
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,958
IT IS MY DUTY TO PROVE
I CAN HANDLE MONEY MATTERS.

50
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,708
I'LL JUST TAKE CHARGE
AND SHOW THEM HOW IT'S DONE.

51
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,333
LEAVE IT TO ME, SASAMI.

52
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,583
YES!

53
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,958
EVERYBODY STAND BACK!
WATCH ME!

54
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,125
OH!  UH-UH.

55
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,500
- HUH?

56
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,583
- ( groans )

57
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,250
( giggles )

58
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,250
I'M OKAY.

59
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,666
- MEOW.

60
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,833
- SO LONG.
I'M LEAVING FOR TOKYO NOW.

61
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,958
- WHY?
- TO GO EARN SOME MONEY.

62
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,875
- I'M GOING TO GO
AND DO THE SAME.

63
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,833
- YEAH, LIKEWISE.
- YOU CAN COUNT ME IN TOO.

64
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,291
- ALL RIGHT!

65
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,125
WE'RE OFF TO TOKYO
TO MAKE LOTS OF DOUGH,

66
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,791
MAYBE A MILLION,
FOR ALL WE KNOW,

67
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,625
SO LET'S GO!
- WITH THEIR LACK OF JOB SKILLS,

68
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,500
THEY'RE GONNA NEED LOTS OF LUCK
JUST TO BREAK EVEN.

69
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,916
- MEOW.

70
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,916
- I KNOW EVERYTHING IN THAT
EARTH CITY CALLED TOKYO

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,875
ALREADY BELONGS
TO YOU,

72
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,416
BUT IF THERE'S
ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE,

73
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,625
JUST TELL ME, YUGI.

74
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,625
- A CASTLE
AT THE EDGE OF THE WATER.

75
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:56,041
WHY DON'T WE BUILD
A HUGE CASTLE RIGHT THERE?

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
- YEAH, SURE.

77
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,875
- ( man over P.A. )
TOKYO.  TOKYO.

78
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,875
- COME ON,
EVERYBODY OUT.

79
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,583
- WOW, IT'S PRETTY
IMPRESSIVE.

80
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,458
- THE METROPOLIS
OF NEON.

81
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,333
- AND PART-TIME JOBS
FOR ALL.

82
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:14,208
PHOTO-OP!
EVERYBODY SAY CHEESE.

83
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,375
( laughs )

84
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,041
- WE DIDN'T TELL TENCHI
OUR PLANS.

85
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,250
- I'M GONNA SURPRISE HIM.
GUESS WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

86
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,291
- MAKE LOTS OF MONEY!

87
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,416
- HMM.
- HMM.

88
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,041
- REMEMBER, MIHOSHI,

89
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,375
STAY FOCUSED ON WHY WE CAME
HERE.  DON'T MESS UP NOW.

90
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:31,041
HEY, KIYONE, LOOK.
THEY'VE GOT FROZEN TANGERINES.

91
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,375
- I DON'T CARE IF THEY'VE GOT
FROZEN DINOSAURS!

92
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,583
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR US
BEING ON THIS PLANET

93
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,541
IN THE FIRST PLACE?
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA?

94
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,583
- UM, LET ME THINK.

95
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:42,291
- YOU'RE SO SLOW.

96
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,041
HERE.
- HUH?

97
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,166
- READ THE MAGAZINE.
THAT'S ALL YOU'RE GOOD AT.

98
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,000
WHOSE FAULT IS IT
WE'VE BEEN GIVEN THE NICKNAMES

99
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,500
DINGBAT AND DING-A-LING,

100
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,000
EVERYONE IN THE ENTIRE
NEIGHBORHOOD

101
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,791
BURSTS INTO LAUGHTER
WHENEVER THEY SEE US?

102
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,291
AND WHOSE FAULT IS IT
THAT WE'VE HAD

103
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,625
NOTHING TO EAT BUT RICE
FOR THE PAST MONTH?

104
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,750
ALL RIGHT NOW,
GIVE ME AN ANSWER.

105
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,625
- WHAT'S THE QUESTION?
- ARGH!

106
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,708
- KIYONE, I'M SORRY.

107
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,916
- ( grunting )

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,583
FROM NOW ON,
YOU'D BETTER DO BETTER.

109
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:09,833
- RIGHT, I WILL.

110
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:13,000
- OKAY, BUT WE MUST
CONCENTRATE.

111
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,250
LET'S MAKE MONEY.

112
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,666
- YEAH!

113
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,791
- WHAT A BEAUTIFUL VIEW.

114
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,416
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO COME HERE.

115
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,916
- YEAH.

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,916
WELL, WE CAN SPEND THE WHOLE
DAY OUT HERE, IF YOU WANT.

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,416
- YOU MEAN IT?
- SURE.

118
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,875
- GREAT.

119
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,916
- I HAVE A FUNNY FEELING
WE'RE BEING WATCHED,

120
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,291
BUT BY WHOM?

121
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,875
OH, I GUESS
I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED.

122
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,458
AFTER ALL, SAKUYA IS
PRETTY CUTE TO LOOK AT.

123
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,666
I MEAN, HERE I AM
STARING AT HER MYSELF.

124
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,458
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?

125
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,625
- NO.  UH, NO.

126
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,041
- DON'T YOU LIKE SITTING
HERE WITH ME, TENCHI?

127
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,000
- NO.  I MEAN, YES.

128
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,291
THAT IS-- WHAT I'M
TRYING TO SAY IS,

129
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,583
I'M USED TO SITTING ALONE
ON TOP OF A MOUNTAIN.

130
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,750
( laughs )

131
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,416
- HMM?
- UH...

132
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,916
BOY, THAT SOUNDED LAME.

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,041
HOW ABOUT...

134
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,125
WE MOVE ON?
- HUH?

135
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,166
- ( Ryoko snoring )
- ( phone ringing )

136
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,625
- WHA--?

137
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,041
- ( ringing )

138
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,750
- AW, SHUT UP.

139
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,458
- ( ringing )

140
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,125
- OH, BUZZ OFF.

141
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,166
( snoring )

142
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,583
( receiver clicking )

143
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,000
- ( grunts )

144
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,583
YOU'RE OUT OF HERE!

145
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,333
- ( clicks )
- GOOD DAY, SIR.

146
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,666
I'LL BE YOUR WAITRESS.
WHAT MAY I GET FOR YOU?

147
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,291
- BLACK COFFEE.
- NOW LET ME REPEAT YOUR ORDER.

148
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,750
ONE GREEN TEA, RIGHT?
- I SAID, BLACK COFFEE.

149
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,333
- WELL, FROM THE WAY YOU LOOK,
YOU MUST BE FULL OF TOXINS.

150
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,625
SEEMS TO ME, YOU COULD USE
SOME VITAMINS.  GREEN TEA

151
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,333
IS MUCH BETTER FOR YOU.
- NO, COFFEE.

152
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,291
- I'LL ORDER YOUR TEA.
- COFFEE!

153
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,916
- HEY, BOSS, ONE GREEN TEA
RIGHT AWAY.

154
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,500
- WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

155
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,333
ARE YOU SOME KIND OF
HEALTH FOOD FANATIC?

156
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,333
- ( gasps )
WHAT A HORRIBLE THING TO SAY.

157
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:57,541
HOW RUDE.

158
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:00,708
- I WON'T BE BACK. EVER!

159
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,416
- THAT MAN HAS A BAD ATTITUDE.
I WAS JUST BEING NICE.

160
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,375
WELL, I'LL SEE TO IT
THAT CUSTOMERS LIKE HIM

161
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,375
DON'T COME HERE ANYMORE.

162
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:08,583
- ( clicks )

163
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,000
- Boss: THE CUSTOMER'S
ALWAYS RIGHT!

164
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,125
- ( Kiyone and Mihoshi
exclaiming )

165
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,208
ARGH!

166
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,375
UH-OH.

167
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,208
- WELL, YOU'VE DONE IT
AGAIN, MIHOSHI.

168
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,333
- W-W-W-WAIT!

169
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,333
IF I PUT THIS BIG POT
OVER THE HOLE,

170
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,916
I CAN GET THIS LITTLE
MESS CLEANED UP

171
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,666
BEFORE ANYBODY NOTICES.

172
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,125
- THIS ISN'T A LITTLE MESS.
IT'S A DISASTER ZONE.

173
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,333
- OH, WELL,
ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN.

174
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,583
( giggling )
- ( growling )

175
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,666
YOU'RE BOTH FIRED!

176
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,416
- MEOW.

177
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:39,958
- OH.

178
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,000
OH, MONEY, MONEY.

179
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,375
HMM.

180
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,250
I WONDER IF THE GIRLS
ARE HAVING ANY LUCK

181
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,083
IN EARNING ANY
IN TOKYO.

182
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,458
I COULD USE A NEW BROOM.
I'M TIRED OF TAPING IT TOGETHER.

183
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,875
OH, BOY,
NOT AGAIN.

184
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
- MEOW.

185
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,458
- ( sighs )

186
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,208
- HMM?

187
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,666
MEOW, MEOW.

188
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,250
- Man: I'M GIVING YOU
ONE MORE CHANCE,

189
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,875
SO DON'T BLOW IT, OKAY?

190
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,166
- HMM.

191
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,750
I STILL FEEL THAT CUSTOMER
WAS NARROW-MINDED

192
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,458
TO GET UPSET
OVER SOMETHING SO MINOR.

193
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:15,666
- HMM?
- NOTHING.

194
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,958
- ( doorbell dings )

195
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,708
- WELCOME TO OUR CAFE.

196
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,291
- THIS LOOKS LIKE A NICE,
QUIET SPOT.

197
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,416
- ( doorbell dings )
- Sakuya: UH-HUH.

198
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,458
- ( gasps )
IS THAT TENCHI WITH SAKUYA?

199
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,500
- ( clicks )
- ( people chattering )

200
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:31,375
- ( ice clinking )

201
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,125
- BOY, THIS IS
SURE AWKWARD.

202
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,625
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TALK ABOUT,

203
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,291
BUT I'VE GOT TO THINK
OF SOMETHING.

204
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:40,291
BASEBALL?  NO, GIRLS DON'T
LIKE TO TALK ABOUT SPORTS.

205
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,250
I COULD TALK ABOUT
THE NEW INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX,

206
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,791
BUT THAT WOULD
PROBABLY BORE HER.

207
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,541
THERE'S COOKING,
BUT I DON'T KNOW

208
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,166
HOW TO MAKE ANYTHING
EXCEPT DUMPLINGS.

209
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,083
OH, YUCK.
THAT SOUNDS SO GEEKY.

210
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,000
THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOMETHING ELSE.

211
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,625
ARGH!  WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

212
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,500
- I'M JUST LOOKING
AT YOU, TENCHI.

213
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,041
- OH.
( chuckles, gulps )

214
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,875
YOU MUST BE WONDERING
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME.

215
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,458
I'VE HARDLY SAID
ANYTHING TO YOU.

216
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,041
- ( Sakuya chuckles )
SO WHAT?

217
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,166
- WELL, AREN'T YOU BORED?

218
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,416
- NO, I'M ENJOYING MYSELF.
- HUH?

219
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,916
- I LIKE
JUST BEING WITH YOU.

220
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,708
- REALLY?

221
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,125
- DEFINITELY.

222
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,333
( giggles )

223
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,333
- ( giggling )

224
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,833
- Ayeka: ATTENTION,
TABLE SEVEN!

225
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,166
FLIRTING IS NOT ALLOWED
IN THIS ESTABLISHMENT.

226
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,833
YOU'VE GOT SOME NERVE,
STARING AT HIM AND GIGGLING.

227
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,333
DON'T THINK I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

228
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,000
- YIKES, I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
SHE MUST BE FOLLOWING ME.

229
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,125
- THAT GIRL LOOKS VERY FAMILIAR.
I THINK I'VE MET--

230
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,291
- LET'S GO.
- HUH?

231
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,750
- COME ON.
- ( Ayeka continues yelling )

232
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,666
LEAVE HIM ALONE, YOU HUSSY.
I'M TALKING TO YOU.

233
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,708
YOU STAY AWAY!  STAY AWAY
FROM MY TENCHI, YOU HEAR?

234
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:39,041
OH, LET ME GO.
YOU MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

235
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,458
- ( all gasp )
- OOPS.

236
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:41,958
- ( motor puttering )

237
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,250
- I'M TIRED.

238
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,708
THERE'S GOT TO BE
AN EASIER WAY TO MAKE MONEY.

239
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,083
IF ONLY I COULD FIND A WALLET
FULL OF 1000-YEN BILLS

240
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,583
OR A WINNING
LOTTERY TICKET.

241
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:50,875
WHAT?

242
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,291
- ( panting )

243
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,875
- IS THIS REAL
OR AM I DREAMING?

244
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,708
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF TOKYO,
TENCHI SUDDENLY APPEARS.

245
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,541
IT MUST JUST BE
A MIRACLE OF LOVE.

246
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,708
HUH?
- ( panting )

247
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,208
- THAT'S MY LOVE,
YOU LITTLE BRAT!

248
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,875
- ( motor revving )
- ( tires screech )

249
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,666
- HEY, YOU THERE!
- Men: HEY, WATCH IT.

250
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,208
- STAY AWAY FROM HIM.
HE'S ALL MINE, UNDERSTAND?

251
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,416
- RYOKO?

252
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,250
- HEY, I THINK
I KNOW HER.

253
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,083
- WATCH OUT.
- Crowd: WHOA.

254
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,791
- GO AWAY.
HE'S MY GUY.

255
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,291
HUH?
- ( panting )

256
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,791
- WHOA!  WHOA!

257
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,958
DARN YOU.

258
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:33,083
- ( crowd cheering,
applauding )

259
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:36,041
- Sasami: AND NOW,
THE ONE-FOOT BALL ROLL.

260
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,250
- MEOW.

261
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,000
- AND JUMP!
( giggles )

262
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,166
- MEOW.

263
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,166
- ( cheering and applause )

264
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,875
- THANK YOU.

265
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,625
WE'RE RAKING IN A PILE OF MONEY.
- MEOW.

266
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:52,250
- I'M SORRY I GOT YOU
FIRED TOO, KIYONE.

267
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,625
LOOKS LIKE I SCREWED UP
BIG TIME AGAIN.

268
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,000
- ( whimpering )

269
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,791
- HEY, COME ON.
CHEER UP, KIYONE.

270
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,333
SMILE.

271
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,333
AFTER ALL, IT'S NOT
THE END OF THE WORLD.

272
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,541
IS IT?

273
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:05,958
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

274
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,208
- ( wind whistling )

275
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,458
- ( sighs )

276
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:11,625
HMM?

277
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,625
HEY, KIYONE,
LOOK AT THIS.

278
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,333
- WHA--?

279
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:19,500
A MILLION YEN?  THAT'S IT!

280
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,583
- MEOW.

281
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,000
MEOW.

282
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,750
- MEOW, MEOW.

283
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,166
- ( distant siren wailing )

284
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,000
- ( car horns honking )

285
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,333
- Mihoshi: WHAT A FUN JOB.
IT'S LIKE ARTS AND CRAFTS.

286
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,833
- IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE, SO WHY ARE
THEY PAYING A MILLION YEN?

287
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,833
- WHO CARES,
AS LONG AS WE GET THE MONEY.

288
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,583
- I SUPPOSE THAT'S TRUE.

289
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,500
- DON'T WORRY,
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

290
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,083
WHOA!
- MIHOSHI!

291
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,666
- HEY, YOU TWO SLACKERS,
STOP GOOFING OFF.

292
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:03,000
I WANT YOU BACK TO WORK
RIGHT NOW, UNDERSTAND ME?

293
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,750
PAY ATTENTION
TO YOUR JOB.

294
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,208
YOU WERE HIRED TO MOVE YOUR
HANDS, NOT YOUR MOUTH.

295
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,916
PICK UP THE PACE,
OR I'LL DOCK YOUR PAY!

296
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,375
- SHE'S A VERY MEAN WOMAN.

297
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,000
I'D LIKE TO STICK HER FACE
IN THIS--

298
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,166
- CALM DOWN, MIHOSHI.
WE ONLY HAVE TO PUT UP WITH HER

299
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,666
ONE MORE DAY.  THEN WE'LL
COLLECT A MILLION YEN.

300
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,166
- YES!
- ( Ayeka whimpering )

301
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,875
- HUH?
- STOP WHINING!

302
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,875
PULL IT TOGETHER.  YOU CAN'T
FALL TILL YOU FINISH THE JOB.

303
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,500
- AYEKA, LOOK,
OVER HERE.

304
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,541
- OH, FANCY SEEING
YOU TWO.

305
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,458
ISN'T THIS A LOVELY SPOT?
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL VIEW.

306
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,083
WHAT AM I SAYING?
I'M AFRAID TO KEEP MY EYES OPEN.

307
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,416
- BUT DIDN'T YOU
COME HERE

308
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,375
BECAUSE YOU SAW THE JOB FLYER
JUST LIKE US?

309
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,875
- ( laughs )

310
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,791
SILLY ME, I ALMOST FORGOT.
I LOVE A HIGH-PLACE JOB.

311
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,208
( laughs )

312
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,750
- GET BACK TO WORK
RIGHT NOW!

313
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,083
THAT GOES FOR YOU TOO.
MOVE IT OR LOSE IT!

314
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,291
- YES, MA'AM.

315
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,208
- WHAT AN UNPLEASANT
PERSONALITY--

316
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,750
TOO MUCH COFFEE.

317
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,375
- Ryoko: ONLY BIRDS AND FOOLS...
- HMM?

318
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,541
- ...ARE LIKELY TO BE
THIS HIGH UP IN THE AIR.

319
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,041
- DID YOU SAY FOOL?
WATCH YOUR TONGUE.

320
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,875
I'M A PRINCESS
OF THE JURAI ROYAL FAMILY.

321
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,375
NOBODY CALLS ME A FOOL.
- HUH?

322
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,916
RYOKO?
- SHE'S A FOOL

323
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,833
AND DOESN'T KNOW IT.
OH, WHAT A SURPRISE.

324
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,333
HEY, WHY ARE
YOU GUYS HERE?

325
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,583
- THAT'S PRECISELY THE QUESTION
I HAVE FOR YOU.

326
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,583
- IT WAS THE HIGHEST-PAYING JOB
I COULD FIND.

327
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:15,083
- YOU TOOK THE WORDS
RIGHT OUT OF MY MOUTH.

328
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,791
I WAS ABOUT TO SAY
THE SAME THING.

329
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:20,166
- HA!  WHY, YOU'RE NOTHING MORE
THAN A GREAT, BIG COPYCAT.

330
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,333
( both hiss )

331
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,500
- WHY IS EVERYBODY
JUST STANDING AROUND?

332
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,208
- ( girls gasp )
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

333
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,166
ARE THE FOUR OF YOU
ALLERGIC TO WORK?

334
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,041
NO WORK, NO YEN.

335
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,000
SAY, "BYE-BYE, MILLION."

336
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,291
- ( all grunting )

337
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,750
HMM!

338
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,083
- MILLION, MILLION, MILLION
MILLION, MILLION, MILLION.

339
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,708
- MILLION, MILLION, MILLION,
MILLION, MILLION,

340
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,250
MILLION, MILLION,
MILLION.

341
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:46,875
- MILLION, MILLION, MILLION.

342
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,250
( sighs )

343
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,750
- MILLION!

344
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,000
( grunting )

345
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,458
UH-OH.

346
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,833
( grunts )

347
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,458
NOBODY SAW THAT,
DID THEY?

348
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,750
OHH.

349
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,666
OH, WHAT A MESS.

350
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,333
UGH.

351
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,166
THERE.  GOOD ENOUGH.

352
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,625
- MILLION, MILLION,
MILLION, MILLION.

353
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,083
- MILLION, MILLION,
MILLION...

354
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,541
- MILLION, MILLION,
MILLION, MILLION.

355
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,125
- MILLION, MILLION.
MILLION, MILLION.

356
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,583
MILLION, MILLION.

357
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,666
- MILLION, MILLION, MILLION,
MILLION, MILLION, MILLION

358
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,625
MILLION, MILLION,
MILLION, MILLION, MILLION!

359
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,333
- WELL NOW,
LET ME SEE.

360
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:26,291
YEAH, MY BUILDING'S DONE.

361
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,083
- OH, BOY,
WE'RE FINISHED.

362
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,500
- YEAH, FINALLY.

363
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,000
- MY NAILS ARE A MESS.

364
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,333
- CUT THE CHATTER.
LET'S GET OUR MONEY.

365
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:36,000
- BRING US THAT MILLION YEN
RIGHT NOW!

366
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,500
- ( Matori laughing )
- HUH?

367
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,416
- NO CAN DO.
THE JOB'S NOT DONE.

368
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,041
BUT YOU'VE BEEN A BIG HELP.
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED

369
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,916
THE SCOPE OF MY PROJECT
IN MY AD.

370
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,666
- Ryoko: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

371
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,416
- YOU'LL SEE.  THE REAL WORK
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN RIGHT NOW.

372
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,708
- HOW CAN THAT BE?

373
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,625
- ( sobbing )
WE HAVE TO DO MORE?

374
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,500
- SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME,
HUMANS HAVE BEEN OBSESSED

375
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,333
WITH BUILDING HUGE STRUCTURES
THAT TAKE YEARS TO COMPLETE.

376
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,208
BUT I, WITH A LITTLE
OF YOUR HELP,

377
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,625
HAVE CREATED
THE MASTER CONTRACTOR--

378
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,541
DAIDARA HOSHI!

379
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,041
- ( growling )

380
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,083
- ( exclaiming )

381
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,041
- GIVE US OUR MONEY!

382
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,041
- ( growling )

383
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,166
- ( girls screaming )

384
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,291
- ( all chattering )
- Man: UP THERE, LOOK.

385
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,875
WHERE DID HE COME FROM?

386
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,000
- ( growling )

387
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,875
- YOU MUST GO TO THE SPOT
WHERE THE LAND MEETS THE SEA

388
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,083
AND BUILD A ROYAL PALACE
IMMEDIATELY.

389
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,083
- ( growling )

390
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,958
- ( screaming )
- Man: GET OUT OF THE WAY!

391
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,458
- ( groaning )

392
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,125
- HUH?

393
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,375
KIYONE, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING THERE?

394
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,875
IF YOU'RE THINKING OF TALKING
HIM INTO PAYING US THE MONEY,

395
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,250
I SAY FORGET IT.

396
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,291
KIYONE, BETTER LISTEN
TO ME.

397
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,000
- TO LIVE ON THIS PLANET,
WE NEED MONEY.

398
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:31,250
BUT EVERY JOB WE'VE TAKEN
TO MAKE THAT MONEY HAS GONE BAD.

399
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,916
WE FINALLY FIND
A JOB WE CAN DO

400
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,291
AND WE WORK SO HARD THAT EVERY
BONE IN OUR BODY ACHES,

401
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,166
AND NOW
SHE WON'T PAY.

402
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,291
SHE CAN'T TREAT US
THIS WAY!

403
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,750
( cocks gun )
I'M KIYONE, GALAXY POLICE,

404
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,791
CURRENTLY STATIONED
ON EARTH, WEST SECTOR.

405
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:45,958
HERE I COME.

406
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,208
- WITH YOU, PARTNER.
RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

407
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,250
- THOSE GIRLS DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH TROUBLE

408
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,666
THEY'RE ABOUT
TO GET INTO.

409
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,500
- ( both chuckle )

410
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,458
- WAIT FOR ME, KIYONE.
- ( both panting )

411
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,416
- ( grunting )

412
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,416
- WOW, LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

413
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,166
OOH.

414
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,375
- FOCUS, MIHOSHI.
READY TO ATTACK?

415
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:08,541
- UH-HUH.

416
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,666
- NOW!

417
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,125
- NOBODY BEATS
THE GALAXY POLICE.

418
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:16,125
- ( humming a tune )

419
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:19,250
- HEY, IT'S NOT
BOTHERING HIM AT ALL.

420
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,541
- JUST KEEP
BLASTING AWAY.

421
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,791
- ( grunting )

422
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,500
( chuckles )

423
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,333
- HEY, DON'T ACT LIKE
IT'S JUST A FLEA BITE.

424
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,625
I WOUNDED YOU.
SURRENDER, YOU BIG GOOF.

425
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,166
- SHOO, SHOO, SHOO.

426
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,166
- ( both whimpering )

427
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,875
- ( inhales )

428
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,083
( blows air )

429
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,666
- ( screaming )

430
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,666
- HIS BREATH IS SO BAD.

431
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,083
- AND POWERFUL.

432
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,833
BUT HE'S BOUND TO HAVE A WEAK
SPOT SOMEWHERE, MIHOSHI.

433
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:53,791
HUH?

434
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,708
HIS BACK'S GOT
A SMALL HOLE.

435
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,958
- OH, RATS, I HOPED
YOU WOULDN'T NOTICE.

436
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,583
- HUH?
- UH...

437
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,875
WELL, I-- I KIND OF SLIPPED
AND GOT MY HEAD STUCK,

438
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,875
MADE A PRETTY DEEP HOLE.
BUT I PATCHED IT.

439
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,250
- THAT'S IT.
- I'M SORRY, KIYONE.

440
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:14,041
- DON'T BE MIHOSHI.
- HUH?

441
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,916
- ( humming a tune )

442
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,250
- ( guns blasting )
- ( grunts )

443
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,666
- NOBODY BEATS
THE GALAXY POLICE.

444
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,791
- ( grunting )

445
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,958
- THE BIGGER THEY ARE,
THE HARDER THEY FALL.

446
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:29,916
- ( screams )

447
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,583
( screams )

448
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,916
- YEAH!

449
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,458
- ( screaming )

450
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,666
- IT WAS A FUN DAY, BUT I'M NOT
TIRED.  HOW ABOUT YOU?

451
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,666
- I'M BEAT
FROM ALL THE RUNNING.

452
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,291
I MUST BE
GETTING OLD.

453
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,583
- ( giggles )
- HMM?

454
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,541
- ( giggling )

455
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,458
- ( chuckling )

456
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,583
- ( both laugh )

457
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,250
- YOU KNOW, TENCHI, I REALLY
DID HAVE A GOOD TIME.

458
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,500
- YEAH, ME TOO.

459
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:07,416
- ( sighs )

460
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,875
OH, THAT BREEZE
FEELS GOOD.

461
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,583
- OH.

462
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,083
- KNOW WHAT
I'M THINKING?

463
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,458
WE SHOULD
DO THIS AGAIN.

464
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:21,791
- MM-HMM.

465
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,333
- ( giggles )

466
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,833
- ( Daidara Hoshi muttering )

467
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,708
- ( both laughing )
YEAH!  WHEE!  WHOO!

468
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,250
- ( groaning )

469
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:43,666
SO HOW MUCH MONEY DID WE MAKE
ON THIS JOB ANYWAY?

470
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,875
- ZIPPITY-DOO-DAH,
ZILCH, NOTHING, NADA.

471
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,000
- OH, WELL,
THEY'VE DESTROYED IT ALL.

472
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,208
- YES,

473
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,125
I'M IMPRESSED,
BUT WAIT TILL NEXT TIME.

474
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:59,666
( laughs )

475
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,375
- Ryoko: HITCHING A RIDE
WAS NOT THE WAY I PICTURED

476
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,125
I'D BE RETURNING HOME.

477
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:08,333
WHAT EXACTLY DID WE ACCOMPLISH
BY THIS TRIP TO TOKYO?

478
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,375
- WE SPENT A WHOLE LOT
OF MONEY TO GET THERE.

479
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,750
AND WE ENDED UP
EARNING NOTHING.

480
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,291
WE'RE WORSE OFF
THAN BEFORE.

481
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,291
WE'LL HAVE TO GIVE UP
BREAKFAST TOO.

482
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,083
- ( both sigh )

483
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,750
- BUT IT WAS STILL
AN ADVENTURE.

484
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,375
- NOT THE KIND THAT PREPARES YOU
TO BE A FUTURE WIFE.

485
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:23,708
I FAILED MISERABLY.

486
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,333
- ( both sigh )

487
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,125
- RATS!

488
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,708
ANYBODY GOT AN EXTRA MIL
JUST LYING AROUND

489
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,125
THAT I COULD USE, HUH?

490
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:34,166
- I LOVE MY NEW BROOM.
IT FEELS GREAT TO EARN A LIVING

491
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,333
AND STILL HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
LEFT FOR EVERYONE.

492
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,166
RIGHT, RYO-OHKI?

493
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,375
- MEOW.

494
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,416
- ( upbeat song playing )

495
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,916
- MEOW, MEOW.

496
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,875
MEOW.

497
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,375
MEOW.

498
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:15,208
- HELLO THERE.
I'M MIHOSHI.

499
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:18,208
SASAMI GOT FREAKED OUT
AND RAN AWAY FROM HOME

500
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:19,791
TO JOIN TENCHI
IN TOKYO.

501
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:22,125
GEE, I WONDER WHY.

502
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:23,750
COULD IT HAVE BEEN US?

503
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:27,541
OH MY, SO THERE'S
THAT NEW FRIEND OF SASAMI.

504
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,708
UH-OH, I SENSE TROUBLE.

505
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:32,250
THERE'S SOMETHING EVIL
ABOUT THAT GIRL.

506
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:34,333
I CAN FEEL IT.

507
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:38,291
THE NEXT EPISODE OF THE NEW
"TENCHI MUYO" SERIES,

508
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,541
"PLAY DATE."
DON'T MISS IT.
