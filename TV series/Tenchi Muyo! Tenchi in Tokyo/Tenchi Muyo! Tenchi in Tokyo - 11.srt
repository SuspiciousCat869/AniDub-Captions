1
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,625
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,541
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,833
- Man: Outer space
is the last frontier.

4
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:14,333
However, an evil force
now disturbs the peace.

5
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,666
- ( laughing )

6
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:22,166
- ( screaming )
- Just hold it right there.

7
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,416
- Anncr: You can always count

8
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,833
on the color-coded
Space Police policemen

9
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:28,166
to save the universe
when it's threatened

10
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,708
by evil flying saucers.

11
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,125
- ( shouting )

12
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,208
- Anncr: Policemen!

13
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,750
- ( shouting )

14
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,750
- (Anncr:) Policemen!
- ( shouting )

15
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:42,958
- (Anncr:) Policemen!  The Space
Police policemen fight valiantly

16
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,916
to stop the wicked Wargons
who disturb the peace

17
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,541
on planet Earth.

18
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,916
- Mihoshi:
WOW!  THEY'RE SO EXCITING

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,875
- ARE YOU WATCHING TV
WHILE WE'RE ON PATROL?

20
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:56,750
- And now "The Challenge
of the Drill Worm Bazooka Man."

21
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,416
- NOT AGAIN!  DO YOU HAVE TO
WATCH THIS POLICEMAN SHOW

22
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,750
WHEN YOU'RE ON DUTY?

23
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,250
- BUT THEY'RE SO DARING,

24
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,250
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE ON DUTY
WHILE THEY'RE ON THE AIR.

25
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,958
GO, GET THE WARGONS!
- ALL RIGHT.

26
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,958
- THEY BETTER NOT BLOW UP--
- SPACE POLICE MY BUTT.

27
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:12,375
THEY'RE JUST A COPY
OF THE REAL GALAXY POLICE.

28
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,083
( sighs )
THEY USED TO CALL ME

29
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,208
THE BRIGHTEST STAR
OF THE GALAXY POLICE.

30
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,916
HOW DID I END UP PATROLLING
THIS BORING PLANET

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,750
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE?

32
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:25,541
I KNOW WHO'S TO BLAME--
- HERE HE COMES.

33
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:28,875
- What are you waiting for?

34
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,500
Set the bomb now!

35
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,625
- Policeman:
Hold it right there.

36
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,875
One, we'll win against
the vile villains.

37
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,833
Two, is much too far
away from home.

38
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,916
Three, is built
to crash and crash.

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,541
Hack up their hideout, men!

40
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,041
Four, for the victory!
Policemen.

41
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,291
Sorry to interrupt your show,
Mihoshi.


42
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,458
- AWW, IT WAS JUST COMING
TO THE BEST PART.


43
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,458
Why do you watch shows
about the police?


44
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:57,125
You are the police.
Now it's time for your report.


45
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,625
Is everything in control
in your solar system sector?


46
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:03,291
- OH, WOW, THERE'S SO MUCH
GOING ON AT HEADQUARTERS.

47
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:06,125
- What was that?
- I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.


48
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,625
- Then would you like to make
your report now,


49
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,833
Detectives Mihoshi and Kiyone?


50
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,125
- YES, SIR, THE WARGONS
HAVE SET A TIME BOMB


51
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,958
ON A SCHOOL BUS. 
ISN'T THAT AWFUL?


52
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:19,041
- I don't want a TV report.
I want a real report.


53
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,333
YES, SIR, EVERYTHING'S UNDER
CONTROL IN OUR SECTOR.


54
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,500
- Right, I can see that.


55
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,666
Now turn off that TV
and do your duty.


56
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,000
- Mihoshi and Kiyone:
YES, SIR.


57
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,708
Purple Policeman!

58
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,166
IT'S THE PURPLE POLICEMAN.
HE'S MY FAVORITE.

59
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,000
JUST LOOK AT THOSE PECS.
HE'LL SHOW THOSE WARGONS.

60
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:38,166
- I JUST WISH I COULD GO
BACK TO HQ.

61
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,833
- The Space Police policemen
are all friends.

62
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,000
- Policemen!

63
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,500
- HERE WE GO. PLEASE COOK IT UP
NICE AND CRISPY.

64
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,083
YEAH! ( hums )

65
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,375
- ( sniffs )

66
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,333
( meows )

67
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:05,208
- RYO-OHKI, THOSE CARROTS
ARE FOR DINNER!  ( shouts )

68
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,666
- ( crash )

69
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,000
- ( whimpers )

70
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:13,083
- OH, RYO-OHKI,
WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH YOU?

71
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,833
YOU COULD HAVE GOT HURT.

72
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,750
NOW GO OUT AND PLAY
AND TRY TO BE GOOD.

73
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:24,125
- Ryoko: TENCHI SENT THESE
COOKIES FOR ME.

74
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,333
- Ayeka:
THIS IS THE LAST ONE

75
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,333
- AND IT WAS
DEFINITELY MEANT...

76
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,583
- Both: TO BE MINE.

77
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:34,208
- WHAT?  YOU'VE ALREADY EATEN
25 OF THEM.  ISN'T THAT ENOUGH?

78
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:37,875
- LOOK WHO'S TALKING, RYOKO.
I KNOW YOU ATE EXACTLY 22

79
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,916
AND YOU'VE GOT THREE MORE
STUFFED DOWN YOUR DRESS.

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,708
- SO THAT MEANS WE'RE EVEN.

81
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,583
- Ayeka: WHOEVER GETS THIS
LAST COOKIE WILL BE...

82
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,958
- Both:
THE ONE TO GET TENCHI.

83
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,250
- THAT DOES IT.
- HE LIKES ME BEST.

84
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,125
- ( shouting )

85
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:03,750
- HA!  YOU MISSED ME.

86
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,791
- NOT THIS TIME.  HA!

87
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:13,416
( gasps )
- Both: WOW.  WE WRECKED IT.

88
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,375
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

89
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,500
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

90
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,458
WELL, WE CAN TRY TO FIX IT.

91
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,708
WE'LL STICK IT BACK TOGETHER.

92
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,750
- ( whimpers )

93
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,458
( stomach growls )

94
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,166
( sniffs )

95
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,125
- YOU BREAK GRANDPA'S STATUE?

96
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,333
YOU SAY YOU DIDN'T DO IT?

97
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,083
ARE YOU SURE?
- MM-HMM.

98
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:04,291
- YOUR LITTLE FRIEND
WRECKED THE STATUE.

99
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,708
WE SAW IT
WITH OUR OWN EYES.

100
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,166
SHE CLIMBED ON TOP OF IT
AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

101
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,666
WHAMMO!  RIGHT?
- OH, YES,

102
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,291
WE BOTH SAW THE WHOLE THING.
- OH, YOU!

103
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:16,000
THAT'S THE SECOND
THING YOU BROKE

104
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,375
AND YOU LIED ABOUT IT, TOO.

105
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,833
RYO-OHKI, COME ON,
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

106
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:24,541
YOU KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T LIE.

107
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,208
RYO-OHKI!

108
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,041
YOU'RE BAD!

109
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,625
( grumbles )

110
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,625
- ( sobs )

111
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,333
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

112
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,791
- ( screeches )

113
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,666
- RYO-OHKI,

114
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,916
COME BACK!

115
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,541
- ( both snickering )
- RYO-OHKI.

116
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,208
- I'M HOME.

117
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:02,375
- GRANDPA, I'M SORRY.
RYO-OHKI BROKE IT.

118
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,958
- WHAT DID SHE BREAK?
- ( laughs )

119
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,916
- WHAT?  YOU'RE SAYING
IT WASN'T RYO-OHKI?

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,041
BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
- HMM...

121
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:14,083
YOU CAN TELL BY THE CUT.
IT WAS DONE IN A SINGLE BLOW

122
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,416
BY SOMEONE
WITH GREAT STRENGTH.

123
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,875
THIS STATUE WAS SENT TO ME
TO DETERMINE ITS VALUE.

124
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,875
YOU SEE, IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE SOLID GOLD.

125
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,250
THANKS TO WHOEVER BROKE IT,
YOU CAN SEE NOW THAT

126
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,083
IT'S JUST GOLD-PLATED.

127
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,916
- I GUESS WE ACTUALLY DID THEM
A FAVOR BY BREAKING THAT THING.

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,291
- I DON'T THINK SO!

129
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,291
- Ayeka:
WE DIDN'T MEAN TO DO IT.

130
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,666
- RYO-OHKI, I'M SO SORRY.
- Grandpa: IT WAS OBVIOUS.

131
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,166
- Ayeka: RYOKO DID IT!
- Ryoko: DID NOT!

132
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,791
- PLEASE COME HOME.

133
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,333
NOW GO OUT AND PLAY
AND TRY TO BE GOOD.

134
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,250
THAT'S THE SECOND
THING YOU BROKE

135
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,166
AND YOU LIED ABOUT IT, TOO.

136
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,083
RYO-OHKI, COME ON,
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

137
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:06,041
YOU KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T LIE.
RYO-OHKI, YOU'RE BAD!

138
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,041
YOU'RE BAD!

139
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,916
- ( crying )

140
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,458
( stomach rumbles )

141
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,333
- ( shrieking )
- ( Ryo-Ohki gasps )

142
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,833
- ( wailing )

143
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,000
- ( meowing )

144
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,291
- OH!

145
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,166
- ( Yugi laughs )

146
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,041
NOW SHE'S TRAPPED
ON THE MOON.

147
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:33,750
SHE IS A MEMBER OF THAT WARM
LOVING FAMILY.

148
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,666
I CAN COUNT ON YOU
TO TAKE CARE OF THIS.

149
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,000
- RIGHT, UOHKI?
( laughing )

150
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,250
- IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS NOW.

151
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:52,208
- GOODBYE.

152
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,500
- I WONDER WHEN SHE'LL
COME BACK TO SCHOOL.

153
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,666
- HEY, YES, YOU!  THE BOY
LOST IN THOUGHT OVER THERE.

154
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,041
WAIT RIGHT THERE!
- HUH?

155
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:06,208
MIHOSHI!  KIYONE!

156
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,708
- THERE'S AN EMERGENCY,
TENCHI, HURRY!

157
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,083
- Mihoshi: BEAM UP!

158
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:14,041
- ( screaming )

159
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,750
- WE'RE ALL FRIENDS.

160
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:19,458
LET'S GO, POLICEMEN!

161
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,791
- ( meows )

162
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,666
- YOU ARE A BIRD-BRAINED
BUBBLEHEAD.

163
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,750
- YOU SHOULDN'T SAY THAT
ABOUT AYEKA.

164
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,166
IT'S TRUE, OF COURSE,
BUT YOU'RE HER SISTER.

165
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,083
YOU SHOULDN'T POINT OUT
WHAT A TWIT SHE IS.

166
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:42,250
- YOU'RE WORSE THAN SHE IS.
YOU BOTH MADE ME LOSE RYO-OHKI!

167
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,916
( wails )
- I'M SORRY, SASAMI.

168
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,583
I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY

169
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,416
FOR ALLOWING RYOKO
TO MESS UP EVERYTHING

170
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,875
BECAUSE SHE IS SUCH A DOLT.

171
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,500
- ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ME,
PRINCESS PRISSY PANTS?

172
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,958
- ( crying )
RYO-OHKI!

173
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,666
- EVERYONE, CALM DOWN!

174
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,875
NOW LET'S THINK
THIS THING THROUGH.

175
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,208
- THEY'VE BEEN ACTING THIS WAY

176
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,791
SINCE RYO-OHKI
DISAPPEARED YESTERDAY.

177
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,750
- THE PROBLEM IS ENTIRELY
ELEMENTARY.

178
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,458
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT
THAT THIS IS THE WORK

179
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,083
OF THE EVIL WARGONS.

180
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:20,458
- IF I HAD JUST BELIEVED
IN RYO-OHKI MORE,

181
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,916
NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE
EVER HAPPENED.

182
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,625
- Tenchi: DON'T WORRY, SASAMI.
RYO-OHKI WILL COME BACK.

183
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:26,916
SHE HAS TO.
- UNH-UNH.

184
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,250
SHE'S NEVER MISSED DINNER
BEFORE.

185
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,333
SHE'S REALLY GONE, TENCHI.

186
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:34,666
- Ryoko: RELAX, SASAMI, SHE'LL
SHOW UP WHEN SHE GETS HUNGRY.

187
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,666
- Ayeka: TRUE, SHE'S A BIG EATER
AND SHE EATS ALMOST AS MUCH

188
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,041
AS YOU KNOW WHO.

189
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,333
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ME,

190
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,875
YOU WHINY BOWL HEAD?
- WELL, LET'S SEE

191
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:47,125
WHO ELSE AROUND HERE CONSUMES
AS MANY CALORIES AS A HIPPO?

192
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,708
- CUT IT OUT.
YOU'RE NOT HELPING!

193
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,041
- RIGHT.

194
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:56,166
- RYO-OHKI, WHERE ARE YOU,
RYO-OHKI?

195
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,000
- FORTUNATELY,
I'M AN EXPERT ON WARGONS.

196
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:02,041
- EXPERT.  THAT'S IT.
WE NEED WASHU.

197
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,375
- YES, THE CASE
OF THE MISSING RYO-OHKI.

198
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,666
OBSERVE CAREFULLY, WATSON.
I WILL BEGIN WITH A FORM.

199
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,958
- WHAT'LL WE DO
WHEN WE FIND HER, TENCHI?

200
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,958
- GO AND PICK HER UP.
WHAT ELSE WOULD WE DO?

201
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,833
- WHAT DOES IT MEAN
TO BEGIN WITH A FORM?

202
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,333
IT MEANS PACKAGING.

203
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,833
- WHAT IF RYO-OHKI HATES ME?

204
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,916
WHAT IF SHE NEVER WANTS
TO COME BACK?

205
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,333
- STYLE IS EVERYTHING.
YOU'VE GOTTA LOOK THE ROLE.

206
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:28,583
- SHE'LL NEVER HATE YOU.
SHE MAY BE UPSET,

207
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:31,541
BUT IF YOU EXPLAIN WHAT
HAPPENED, SHE'LL UNDERSTAND.

208
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:35,083
- ACCESSORIZE, NOW THAT
IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS.

209
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,000
TA-DA!

210
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,791
LET'S NOT FORGET VISUAL AIDS.
GO, GUYS!

211
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,708
- "WELCOME TO TIME MONITOR."

212
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:47,208
- MY NEW TIME MONITOR WILL
TRACK RYO-OHKI'S BRAINWAVES.

213
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,916
THUS, FIXING HER POSITION
ON AN X-Y AXIS.

214
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,041
- All: OH!

215
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,666
- AND I HAVE AN EVEN
JAZZIER INVENTION,

216
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,708
WHICH WILL ALLOW THE USER
TO CONTACT RYO-OHKI

217
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,208
FROM THIS VERY SPOT.

218
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:00,041
THE UZU PILL.  TRES CHIC.

219
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,666
TAKE THIS PILL
AND YOU'LL HAVE INSTANT ESP

220
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,125
SO YOU CAN CONTACT
RYO-OHKI'S BRAIN.

221
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,833
- All: OH!
- OF COURSE, AFTER YOU USE IT,

222
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:13,083
YOU'LL FALL ASLEEP FOR ABOUT
FOUR YEARS AND THREE MONTHS.

223
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,250
- OH!

224
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,875
- Tenchi:
WE'LL GO WITH THE TIME MONITOR.

225
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,916
- OH, FINE.
PLAY IT SAFE.

226
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,250
- YOU'RE HOOKED UP
TO TIME MONITOR.

227
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,916
- ( grunting )

228
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
- Ryoko: HOW LONG'S
THIS GONNA TAKE?

229
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,250
DID YOU FIGURE IT OUT YET,
WASHU?

230
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,500
- Ayeka:
EARTH TO MISS WASHU.

231
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,500
- Mihoshi:
SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE'S GONE WACKO.

232
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,791
- All: HELLO!

233
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:37,083
- WOW!
SHE'S OFF THE PLANET.

234
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,791
RYO-OHKI'S MADE
A LUNAR LANDING.

235
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,708
SHE'S ON THE MOON.
- ( gasping )

236
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,916
- HOLD ON.
THERE'S NEW DATA COMING IN.

237
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,666
SHE'S WITH SOMEONE
OR SOMETHING.

238
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,958
- Sasami: WHAT IS IT?
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY

239
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,541
GIVEN THE CURRENT DATA.
- Ryoko: YEAH, RIGHT.

240
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,291
- WAIT.  THAT'S IT.  RYO-OHKI.
SOMEONE'S KIDNAPPED HER.

241
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,291
- KIDNAPPED.
- THAT'S IT.

242
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,375
SHE'S DEFINITELY BEEN
SHANGHAIED.  YEP.

243
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,625
- AHA!

244
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,625
- I CONCUR.

245
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,041
NO DOUBT THE KIDNAPPERS
ARE EVIL TWISTED WARGONS.

246
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,333
- WILL YOU CAN IT?

247
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,666
- ALL I NEED TO DO
IS CATCH THE KIDNAPPER.

248
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,291
I'LL RETURN
TO HQ AS A HERO.

249
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,750
EVERYONE,
JUST LEAVE THIS TO US.

250
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:16,250
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A CASE FOR YOUR
TRUSTY GALAXY POLICE FORCE.

251
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,083
DETECTIVES FIRST CLASS KIYONE
AND MIHOSHI ARE PREPARED

252
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,166
TO DO THE JOB.

253
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,041
- HMM.
VERY WELL, DETECTIVE KIYONE.

254
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,708
I'LL SET UP MY OFFICE HERE
SO I CAN MONITOR YOUR ACTIONS

255
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,958
AND KEEP AN EYE OUT
FOR THOSE EVIL WARGONS.

256
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,166
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME!

257
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,375
- I'M COMING, TOO.
- SASAMI.  SO AM I.

258
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,041
- WELL, THEN I GUESS
I'LL COME, TOO.

259
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,708
IT'LL BE NICE TO BREATHE THE AIR
OF OUTER SPACE ONCE MORE.

260
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:44,791
- I'D HAVE TO SEE THAT SINCE
THERE IS NO AIR IN OUTER SPACE.

261
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,625
BUT I'M SURE
THAT WON'T STOP YOU, RYOKO.

262
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:55,041
RYO-OHKI, WAIT FOR ME.
I'M COMING.

263
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,416
- THIS IS MY BIG CHANCE.
HEY!

264
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,208
- AYEKA, PUT ME DOWN
OR YOU WILL REGRET IT.

265
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,500
- STOP FIGHTING!

266
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,958
- ALL RIGHT,
WE'VE MADE IT.

267
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,708
- YES, WE'RE ON THE MOON.

268
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,583
- LIKE IN ALL THOSE
SCIENCE FICTION MOVIES, HUH?

269
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,666
YEAH, THE INVADERS ALWAYS USE IT
AS AN ATTACK BASE.

270
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,458
WHICH MEANS IT'S A PERFECT PLACE
FOR A GROUP PHOTOGRAPH.

271
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,541
- I'M NOT COMPLAINING, BUT--

272
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:21,375
- WHOSE IDEA WAS IT TO ISSUE
SPACE SUITS WITH RYO-OHKI EARS?

273
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,333
- Washu:
MINE. THEY'RE VERY STYLISH.

274
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,916
I TOLD YOU,
YOU HAVE TO LOOK THE PART.

275
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,041
- THAT MAY BE,
BUT I COULDN'T GO ALONG

276
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,708
BECAUSE THERE WASN'T
ENOUGH ROOM,

277
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,625
SO DO I STILL NEED 
TO DRESS LIKE THIS?

278
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,333
I FEEL A LITTLE SILLY,
YOU KNOW?

279
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:35,416
- PROPER EARS ARE ESSENTIAL
FOR A GOOD INVESTIGATION.

280
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,500
ANY DETECTIVE KNOWS THAT.
GET WITH THE PROGRAM, TENCHI.

281
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:41,875
- Kiyone: VIDEO.  THAT'S IT.
I CATCH THE KIDNAPPERS,

282
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:45,083
GET IT ALL ON TAPE
AND SEND IT STRAIGHT TO HQ.

283
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,708
- HEY, MIHOSHI.
COME ON, TURN ON THE VIDEO.

284
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,416
- I ALREADY DID IT, PARTNER.

285
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,541
- ( laughs )
IT'S ALL SET.

286
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:58,000
I'M FINALLY
GOING TO GET REASSIGNED.

287
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,416
LOGGING IN.
OUR INVESTIGATION UNIT.

288
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,625
( clears throat )

289
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:07,041
I HAVE LED OUR INVESTIGATION
UNIT HERE TO THE LUNAR SURFACE.

290
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,458
I WILL LEAD THE WAY
AS WE HUNT DOWN THE CULPRIT.

291
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:13,416
- Mihoshi: KIYONE, HURRY OR
YOU'RE GOING TO GET LEFT BEHIND.

292
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,375
- HUH?  HANG ON, YOU GUYS.
WAIT FOR ME!

293
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,083
( screaming )

294
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,208
Mihoshi:
THAT WAS A GREAT TRICK, KIYONE.

295
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,625
Ryoko: YOU'RE EASILY
ENTERTAINED, MIHOSHI.

296
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,541
SHE TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF THE MOON'S GRAVITY.

297
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,625
THAT WAS SMART.

298
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:30,458
- Ryoko: NOT THAT SMART.
IN FACT, MORE LIKE STUPID.

299
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,916
- HUH?  OH, RYO-OHKI.

300
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,708
- ( screeches )
- WAIT A MINUTE.

301
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,291
- RIGHT, SHE'S GOT
TO BE DIFFICULT.

302
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:43,041
- SHE'S JUST SENSITIVE.
- RYO-OHKI, PLEASE DON'T

303
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:46,666
RUN AWAY FROM ME.
LET ME EXPLAIN.

304
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,625
- ( all shriek )

305
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,625
- WHAT IN THE WORLD?
- THEY'RE ALL RYO-OHKIS.

306
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:55,958
- YOU CAN'T TELL THEM APART.

307
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,958
- OH, WOW.

308
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,625
THEY SAY RABBITS MULTIPLY,
BUT THIS ONE TOPS IT.

309
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,791
- YEAH, RIGHT,
THAT'S A RICH ONE.

310
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,750
- Sasami: HOW CAN I TELL
WHICH ONE IS THE REAL RYO-OHKI?

311
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,708
THEY ARE SO MANY OF THEM.

312
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,666
- SASAMI, YOU'VE GOT TO FIND
THE REAL RYO-OHKI.

313
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,833
COME ON,
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.

314
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,166
- HOW?
- WHAT IF SHE CAN'T FIND HER?

315
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,250
- SHE'S A WONDER CHILD.

316
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,375
SHE CAN DO ANYTHING,
THE LITTLE PEST.

317

- ( panting ) BUT--
AYEKA.

318
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,000

319
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,750
- YEAH, GO FOR THE GOLD MEDAL.

320
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:43,125
- I'M SO SORRY, RYO-OHKI.

321
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:46,625
I BLAMED YOU WHEN YOU
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

322
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,708
FORGIVE ME.
PLEASE COME BACK.

323
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:04,708
RYO-OHKI.
- ( meows )

324
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,375
- SHE DID IT!
- ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!

325
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:10,750
- LET'S GO HOME, OKAY?
- YEAH!

326

330
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,208
- IT'S A MONSTER.

331
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,625
- THAT'S THE CULPRIT.
HE WAS IN DISGUISE.

332
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:34,958
- RYO-OHKI!

333
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:45,375
- GO, GO!
- NOW'S MY CHANCE.

334
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,583

- YOU GOT IT!  GET HIM!

338
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,500
- UGH!

339

- ( wails )

340
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,458
- YOU SEE, THEY ACT SO TOUGH,

341
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,000
THEN FIRST SIGN OF TROUBLE,
POOF, THEY'RE OUT OF HERE.

342
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,916
- HEY, EVERYONE,
HOW ABOUT THAT?

343
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,250
WE PUT HIM AWAY.

344
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,791
NOW ALL I'VE GOT TO DO
IS GET THE VIDEOTAPE,

345
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,208
SEND IT BACK TO HEADQUARTERS
AND I'LL BE REASSIGNED.

346
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:17,791
- KIYONE, I GOT THE TAPE.
IT RECORDED MY POLICEMAN SHOW.

347
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:21,833

366
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,041

I COULD HAVE BEEN PROMOTED,

370
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:29,125
REASSIGNED TO HEADQUARTERS
IF IT WEREN'T FOR THAT TAPE

371
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,416
AND HER.

372
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,166
- THEY'RE REALLY BUSY BEES.
- OH!

373
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,666
Kiyone:
I WANNA BE REASSIGNED!

379
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:19,750
WHAT?  FATHER RAN AWAY
FROM HOME TO JOIN TENCHI?

380
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22,833
WELL, COME TO THINK OF IT,
EVER SINCE SASAMI FELL ILL,

381
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:25,708
FATHER HAS BEEN TAKING CARE
OF US ALL BY HIMSELF.

382
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:28,625
I'M NOT SURPRISED
THAT HE'S GOTTEN A BIT TIRED.

383
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:31,458
BUT THE BRIGHT SIDE OF IT ALL
IS THAT'S IT'S GOOD

384
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:33,291
FOR A FATHER TO GET AWAY
FROM WORK AND SPEND TIME

385
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:35,625
WITH HIS BOY ONCE
IN A WHILE.
