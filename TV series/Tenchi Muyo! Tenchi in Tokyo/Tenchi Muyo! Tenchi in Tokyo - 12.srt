1
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,541
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,833
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:19,583
HORRIBLE!  YUCK.  PHOOEY.
DREADFUL.  TERRIBLE.

4
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,666
I AM TELLING YOU,
THIS STUFF IS BAD.

5
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,416
- YES, IT'S RATHER SALTY,
HONORABLE FATHER.

6
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,875
- I'M SORRY, FATHER,
BUT THIS ISN'T EVEN EDIBLE.

7
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:30,083
THERE'S EGGPLANT IN IT.
- HEY, STOP COMPLAINING.

8
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,541
MR. MASAKI HAS GONE OUT
OF HIS WAY TO COOK THIS FOR US.

9
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:35,291
WITH SASAMI ON THE SICK LIST,
WE SHOULD BE GRATEFUL

10
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,208
JUST TO HAVE FOOD.
- ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN,

11
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,875
YOU BLEW IT.
SORRY, NOBUYUKI.

12
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,208
- OLD MAN, COOK IT AGAIN
AND MAKE IT MORE SALTY.

13
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:44,541
- PLEASE MAKE IT LESS SALTY.

14
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:47,583
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
MISO SOUP IS NO GOOD

15
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,375
UNLESS IT'S SALTY ENOUGH
TO MAKE YOUR MOUTH TWIST UP.

16
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,791
- HA!  THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I EXPECTED AN UNCIVILIZED

17
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,541
COUNTRY BUMPKIN
LIKE YOU WOULD SAY.

18
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,333
- BETTER WATCH YOUR MOUTH,
MISSY.

19
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,541
HOW DARE YOU CHALLENGE
MY TASTE BUDS.

20
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:01,208
I WON THE GOLD MEDAL AT
THE PIRATE GOURMET COMPETITION.

21
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,750
JUST YOU LOOK.
I'M A REAL FOOD EXPERT.

22
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,416
HA!  THE BEST FOOD YOU'VE
TASTED IS THE MEALS

23
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,166
YOU ATE BEHIND BARS
IN GALAXY PRISON.

24
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,750
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS YOU'RE
1,000 YEARS BEHIND ME.

25
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,500
I'M A THREE STAR GOURMET
OF THE JURAI ROYAL FAMILY.

26
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,500
- ( both grunting )

27
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:17,916
I'M THE EXPERT!

28
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,750
- TOO SALTY!
- TOO BLAND!

29
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,916
- SALTY!
- BLAND!

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,083
( grunting )

31
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,625
- STOP IT!  BACK OFF!

32
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,625
- THE EGGPLANT'S YUCKY!

33
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,291
- ( sighs )

34
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,875
- ( shouting )
- ( crashing )

35
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:45,291
- GET UP.  MUST MAKE DINNER
AND SWEEP THE HOUSE.

36
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,625
MUSTN'T LET THE LAUNDRY
PILE UP.

37
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,458
I REALLY GOTTA GET
MY HOUSEWORK DONE.

38
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,791
SO MUCH TO DO.
- ( whimpers )

39
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,583
- TOO SALTY.
- BLAND AND THAT'S FINAL.

40
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,166
- TOO MUCH EGGPLANT!
- ( dishes clanking )

41
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,625
- ( vacuum cleaner whirring )
- ( snoring )

42
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,500
- ( sneezes )

43
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,083
- AGH!

44
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,833
( thinking ) I ENVY CLOUDS.

45
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:36,333
THEY'RE SO FREE.
THEY JUST FLOAT AROUND.

46
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:39,666
I'M TIRED, HONEY.

47
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,375
I NEED TO GET AWAY
FOR A WHILE.

48
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:50,416
I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER
HOW TENCHI IS DOING.

49
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:55,625
I THINK I'D BETTER LOOK IN
ON HIM, DEAR.

50
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,958
- Sakuya:
I SEE CLEARLY NOW.

51
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,208
YOU ALREADY HAVE SOMEONE
WAITING FOR YOU.

52
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:14,083
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE REALLY
A LOUSY LIAR, TENCHI.

53
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,375
GOODBYE, TENCHI.

54
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,041
- ( sighs )

55
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,000
- HMM.

56
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,708
HOW IN THE WORLD
WILL I EVER FIND MY BOY?

57
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,625
- MATORI.
- I KNOW WHO YOU MEAN.

58
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,333
I SEE HIM.
TENCHI'S FATHER.

59
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,791
- ( laughs )

60
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,416
- WELL, HERE WE GO.

61
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,625
- OH!

62
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,916
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, SIR?

63
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,541
- I'M FINE, THANK YOU.  AGH!

64
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,500
- OH, MY.
YOU'RE MR. MASAKI, AREN'T YOU?

65
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:09,916
- THERE.  NOW I CAN SEE YOU.
DO I KNOW YOU FROM SOMEWHERE?

66
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,416
- YES, YOU DO.
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU AGAIN.

67
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,750
- DON'T TELL ME.
YOUR NAME IS...

68
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,000
WAIT.  IT'LL COME TO ME.

69
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,250
- I KNOW YOUR SON.

70
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,875
- OF COURSE.  THAT'S IT.
YOU'RE TENCHI'S FRIEND.

71
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,875
WHAT A COINCIDENCE
MEETING YOU

72
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,958
HERE IN THE MIDDLE
OF THIS GREAT BIG CITY.

73
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,666
ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH THIS NEIGHBORHOOD?

74
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,625
- AS A MATTER OF FACT, I AM.

75
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,791
- I WISH I HAD TIME TO TALK.

76
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,875
BUT I'M TRYING
TO FIND TENCHI'S APARTMENT.

77
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,333
WOULD YOU BE ABLE
TO SHOW ME THE WAY?

78
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:46,083
- OF COURSE, IF YOU WISH.

79
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,583
- HEY, I REMEMBER NOW.

80
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:50,666
YOUR NAME,
IT'S SAKUYA SHIROKUMA.

81
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,458
- NOT QUITE.
- WHAT THEN?

82
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,041
- IT'S ACTUALLY KUMASHIRO.

83
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,625
- ( laughs ) 

84
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,375
- ( doorbell rings )

85
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,000
- Tenchi: BE RIGHT THERE.

86
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,000
( gasps ) DAD, IS THAT YOU?

87
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,125
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

88
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:09,333
- I HAD TO COME TO TOKYO
ON SOME IMPORTANT BUSINESS.

89
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:12,666
SO I THOUGHT I'D STOP BY
AND SURPRISE YOU.

90
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,791
- HOW'D YOU FIND ME?
- I GOT SOME GREAT HELP.

91
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,708
- SAKUYA BROUGHT YOU?

92
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,916
- I'M STARVING.

93
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,333
- I WONDER WHERE
OUR NOBLE FATHER'S GONE.

94
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,833
- KIYONE, COME ON,
YOU GOTTA GET UP NOW.

95
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,166
- HEY, AYEKA, GET ME SOME FOOD.
- WHY SHOULD I?

96
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,083
THERE'S NO ONE TO COOK IT.
- GO COOK IT YOURSELF.

97
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:37,125
- WHY SHOULD I DO THAT?
- BECAUSE I SAID SO.

98
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,666
- MONKEY BREATH,
HOLD YOUR TONGUE.

99
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,750
- ( stomachs rumble )
- HUH?

100
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,166
- ( both sigh )

101
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,541
- I'VE AN IDEA.
WHY DON'T WE GO TO A RESTAURANT?

102
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:54,541
- MM-HMM.
- ( clears throat )

103
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,375
- ( thinking )
THIS SILENCE IS DEAFENING.

104
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,625
I WONDER WHAT'S MAKING
THEM SO UNCOMFORTABLE.

105
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:02,375
IS IT ME?
MAYBE I SHOULD LEAVE THEM ALONE.

106
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,708
IT CAN ONLY BE ONE THING.
THEY'RE IN LOVE.

107
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:08,458
NOW THAT I FIGURED IT OUT,
IT'S UP TO ME THE MATURE GROWNUP

108
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,708
TO HELP THESE YOUNG PEOPLE
COMMUNICATE.

109
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,416
THE FIRST THING I'VE GOT TO DO
IS GET THEM TO LOOSEN UP.

110
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,041
SO THEY FEEL RELAXED.
I'LL SET AN EXAMPLE

111
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,625
AND SHOW THEM HOW RELAXED
I AM MYSELF.

112
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:21,125
- ( clears throat )
- HUH?

113
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:25,291
- HEY, HOW ABOUT THIS YEAR'S
CHAMPIONSHIP BASEBALL GAMES?

114
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,166
DIMMIDANGO HIGH SCHOOL'S
BEEN DOING GREAT.

115
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,625
RIGHT UP THERE WITH THE BEST.

116
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,500
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THEM
PLAY THAT FINAL GAME

117
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,250
AGAINST ONIGAJIMA HIGH SCHOOL.

118
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,041
- WELL, THAT WENT OVER
LIKE A LEAD BALLOON.

119
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,041
THEY'RE STARING AT ME
LIKE I JUST ESCAPED

120
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,416
FROM THE BOOBY HATCH.
I NEED A DIFFERENT TOPIC.

121
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,125
SOMETHING THAT'S TRENDY,
COOL, HIP.

122
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,083
SOMETHING YOUNG PEOPLE
THEIR AGE CAN RELATE TO.

123
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,583
( clears throat )

124
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:54,458
WELL, IT'S FASHIONABLE TO MEET
AT THE HACHIKO STATUE.

125
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:57,500
( laughs )

126
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,791
( gasps )
WHAT DOES THE STATUE OF HACHIKO

127
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,833
HAVE TO DO WITH THEM?
I'M MAKING A FOOL OF MYSELF.

128
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,208
I KNOW.  I'LL WARM 'EM UP
WITH A RIDDLE.

129
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:08,166
WHAT'S BLACK AND WHITE
AND READ ALL OVER?

130
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,666
IT'S A NEWSPAPER.
- ( laughs weakly )

131
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,208
- HMM.

132
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,625
- TOUGH AUDIENCE.
I'M DYING HERE.

133
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:22,791
SORRY, GUYS.
I'LL MAKE MYSELF USEFUL

134
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,291
AND GET SOME COLD DRINKS.

135
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,333
- I LOVE THAT OLD MAN
FOR TRYING.

136
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,083
I THINK I CAN USE HIM.

137
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:40,041
- ( growls )

138
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,375
- WE'RE NOT TRYING TO STEAL IT
FROM YOU.

139
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,125
WE JUST WANNA BORROW IT
SO THAT WE CAN ALL GO OUT

140
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,375
AND GET SOMETHING TO EAT.
SEE?

141
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,708
- WE'LL GIVE IT RIGHT BACK.
WE PROMISE.

142
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,125
- PLEASE, WE'RE BEGGING YOU.

143
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,458
- ( grumbles )

144
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:56,875
- YOU LITTLE BRAT.  I'M NOT
GONNA ASK YOU NICELY FOREVER.

145
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,625
UNDERSTAND ME?
( cracks knuckles )

146
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,125
GIVE ME THAT!
- ( explosion )

147
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,541
- ( Ryo-Ohki screeches )
- ( Ryoko winces )

148
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,416
- ( thudding )

149
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,041
- OH!

150
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,833
- WOW.  YOU'VE GROWN
QUITE STRONG, RYO-OHKI.

151
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,291
YOU MUST BE WORKING OUT.

152
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:21,000
- SORRY WE BOTHERED YOU,
RYO-OHKI.

153
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,208
- I MUST DO LAUNDRY
AND MAKE SUPPER.

154
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,875
CLEAN UP THE HOUSE.

155
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,666
- I DON'T SEEM TO BE DOING
ANY BETTER HERE HELPING TENCHI

156
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,666
THAN I DID BACK HOME
HELPING THE GIRLS.

157
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,041
ISN'T THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO, DEAR WIFE?

158
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:49,125
- I WILL MORPH THIS
INTO SOMETHING VERY USEFUL.

159
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:58,041
YOU HAVE BEEN CREATED OUT
OF THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND

160
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,875
OF A FATHER WHO WANTS
TO HELP HIS SON FIND TRUE LOVE.

161
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,166
YOU ARE PSEUDO DAD.
- I SEE.

162
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,541
- HERE'S YOUR JOB.
YOU ARE TO PLAY CUPID.

163
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:08,125
YOUR ASSIGNMENT IS TO CONNECT
THESE TWO YOUNG LOVERS

164
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,375
AND BRING THEM TOGETHER.

165
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,541
- A LOVE MACHINE?

166
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:15,041
- YOU MAY CHOOSE YOUR OWN WAY
TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR MISSION.

167
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,541
- I'M READY FOR LOVE.

168
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:20,583
I'M NOT FINISHED WITH YOU.
COME BACK.

169
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,458
- I'M ON A LOVE MISSION!

170
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,625
- ( meows )

171
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,500
- I SHOULD BE ABLE
TO THINK OF SOMETHING TO SAY.

172
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,291
ANYTHING.

173
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:45,125
- TENCHI, I'M IMPOSING.

174
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,583
YOU SHOULD BE SPENDING
THIS TIME WITH YOUR FATHER.

175
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,166
I'M SORRY.
- PLEASE DON'T BE.

176
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,250
MY FATHER IMPOSED ON YOU
TO BRING HIM HERE.

177
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:54,458
- NOT AT ALL.
YOUR FATHER'S A FUNNY FELLOW.

178
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,125
- THAT'S FOR SURE.

179
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:01,291
I WONDER WHAT'S KEEPING
HIM SO LONG.

180
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,125
I MIGHT AS WELL MAKE US
SOME COFFEE WHILE WE WAIT.

181
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:06,833
BE RIGHT BACK.
- OH!

182
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,541
- I'M SORRY,
BUT I HAVE TO GO NOW.

183
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,708
- WHAT?

184
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,625
- ( Sakuya gasps )

185
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,041
- HMM.

186
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,500
- ( Sakuya screaming )
- ( speaking gibberish )

187
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,166
WHAT IN THE WORLD
ARE YOU DOING?

188
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,625
- I WANT YOU TO BE MINE.

189
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:53,250
I'M IN LOVE.  I'M IN LOVE.
I'M IN LOVE.  I'M IN LOVE.

190
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,708
I'M IN LOVE.  I'M IN LOVE.
I'M IN LOVE...

191
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,000
- IDIOT.  YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HER.

192
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,291
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

193
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,416
YOU SHOULD HAVE WAITED
FOR MY INSTRUCTION.

194
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,375
- I WANT SOME FOOD.

195
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,583
- I WANT A GOOD MEAL.

196
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,541
- I WANT EGGPLANT!

197
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:11,041
I MUST BE CRAZY WITH HUNGER.

198
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,458
- I'M IN LOVE.  I'M IN LOVE.
I'M IN LOVE.  I'M IN LOVE.

199
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:17,541
I'M IN LOVE!

200
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:23,375
OH, YEAH!

201
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,833
I'M IN LOVE.
- HUH?

202
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,291
- LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.

203
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,250
- OH, NO!

204
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,458
I WANT YOU TO BE MINE.

205
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,416
I DON'T.  MNH-MNH.

206
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:42,041
- ALL RIGHT, YEAH!

207
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,375
OOH!

208
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,875
I WANT YOU TO BE MINE.

209
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,208
- WHAT?  OH.
I'M NOT AVAILABLE.

210
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,625
- SHE SURE IS.

211
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,583
- I'M IN LOVE.  I'M IN LOVE.

212
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:59,291
YEAH!  HUH?

213
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,541
I WANT YOU TO BE MINE.

214
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,041
- NO WAY, YOU CREEP.

215
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,583
- HUH?

216
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,166
- CHILL OUT, DUDE.
- I'M IN LOVE.  I'M IN LOVE.

217
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,750
I'M IN LOVE.  I'M IN LOVE.
I'M IN LOVE.  I'M IN LOVE.

218
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,708
- Nobuyuki: I'M BACK.

219
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,666
HMM?

220
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,708
- Tenchi's voice:
DAD, I'VE GONE OUT

221
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:22,875
TO LOOK FOR SAKUYA.

222
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,583
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME
AND HAVE SOME TEA.

223
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,208
I'LL BE BACK SOON.

224
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:29,458
- HMM.  IT'S GREAT TO BE YOUNG
AND IN LOVE, RIGHT, DEAR?

225
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:30,916
- Matori: WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING,

226
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,416
YOU SLOW-WITTED NUMBSKULL?

227
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,666
WHO TOLD YOU TO RUN OFF

228
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,291
WITH EVERY PRETTY
FEMALE IN YOUR PATH? HUH?

229
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:40,416
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE YOU COULD
BE COMPLETELY STUPID.

230
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,666
NOW I WANT YOU
TO PAY ATTENTION.

231
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,583
YOUR MISSION IS TO HELP GET
THOSE TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER.

232
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,541
UNDERSTAND?
- POSSIBLY.

233
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,375
- I DON'T LIKE MISTAKES.
YOU BEST GET IT RIGHT.

234
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,000
- I WILL.
- DON'T FORGET.

235
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:58,000
IF YOU FAIL ME AGAIN, I WILL
BLOW YOU AWAY, PSEUDO DAD.

236
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:01,000
- I GOT IT.
- WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

237
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:04,666
GET TO WORK.
- YES, DEAR.  WILL YOU BE MINE?

238
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,208
- OH!  GET OUT OF HERE!

239
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,666
I'M IN LOVE!

240
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,291
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
TO HER.

241
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:18,333
I DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE
THE LAST TIME.

242
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,250
BUT I'LL BE HISTORY
FOR SURE THIS TIME 

243
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,833
IF I DON'T THINK OF SOMETHING.

244
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,000
- ( sighs )
I DON'T KNOW WHY,

245
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,875
BUT I CAN'T FORGET HIM.

246
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,875
- ( Pseudo Dad
speaking gibberish )

247
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:41,208
- HUH? ( gasps )

248
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,000
- DAD, IS THAT YOU?

249
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,541
- HA HA!
I'M IN LOVE, SON.

250
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,916
- NOT WITH HER.
PUT HER DOWN.

251
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,791
YOU'RE NOT HIM.

252
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,125
YOU IMPOSTOR!
RELEASE HER RIGHT NOW.

253
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,916
I'M NOT GONNA ASK YOU AGAIN.

254
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,041
COME BACK HERE, YOU!

255
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:31,458
PUT HER DOWN!

256
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,375
- I GUESS THAT'S THE BEST
I CAN EXPECT FROM HIM.

257
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,750
WELL, MIGHT AS WELL
LET HIM RUN WILD.

258
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,708
AT LEAST HE'LL KEEP
THE BOY BUSY.

259
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:42,708
LET HIM DO HIS BEST.  THE REAL
FATHER WILL FINISH THE JOB.

260
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,916
( laughing )

261
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,458
- BAD OMEN.

262
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,833
HUH?  HMM?  OH!

263
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:59,250
I WONDER.  MAYBE SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO TENCHI.

264
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,666
- RELEASE HER.
- NO.  I LOVE HER.

265
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,666
- ( gasps ) TENCHI, IT'S YOU.

266
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,750
- TAKE YOUR ARM OFF HER
RIGHT NOW!

267
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,166
- LOVE, LOVE LOVE!

268
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,500
- PLEASE, LET HIM GO.

269
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,166
- HE HAS TO BE AROUND HERE
SOMEWHERE.

270
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,416
TENCHI, IF YOU CAN HEAR ME,
SAY SOMETHING.

271
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,416
- ( grunting )

272
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,875
- HELP, SOMEBODY, PLEASE.

273
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,125
- ( panting ) TENCHI!

274
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,333
HANG ON, SON!

275
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:39,083
TENCHI AND MISS SHIROKUMA
ARE IN TERRIBLE TROUBLE.

276
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,833
THEY'VE BEEN CAPTURED
BY A GREAT BIG UGLY MONSTER.

277
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,791
- MY DAD.
- MY NAME IS KUMASHIRO.

278
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:48,000
- I'M IN LOVE AND LOVE WINS OUT
OVER EVERYTHING.

279
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,791
- NOT YOUR KIND OF LOVE.
YOU'VE COME HERE

280
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,833
TO DISTURB
THE EARTH'S PEACE.

281
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,291
IN THE NAME OF THE GREAT REASON
THAT RULES THIS PLANET,

282
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:59,291
I MUST DEFEAT YOU.
- DAD, HOW CAN YOU DO THAT?

283
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:02,458
- DON'T YOU WORRY, TENCHI.
BECAUSE I AM THE SON

284
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,875
OF A SHRINE KEEPER,

285
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,125
AND ALL SHRINES HAVE A WEAPON
TO DESTROY EVIL DEMONS.

286
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:09,041
NOW WATCH!
ANYBODY THERE?

287
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:12,833
- WELCOME TO SAKIRA TENMANGU
SHRINE.  HOW MAY I HELP YOU?

288
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,250
- I NEED A DEMON DESTROYER
ARROW PLEASE.

289
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,208
NOW TAKE THIS!  AGH!

290
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,875
- DAD, I REALLY DON'T THINK
THAT'S GOING TO WORK.

291
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,291
- ( screaming )

292
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:34,375
I'M FINISHED.  YOU SUCKED
THE LOVE RIGHT OUT OF ME.

293
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,875
- THAT LOVE DEMON TURNED OUT
TO BE JUST A GREAT BIG WIMP.

294
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,916
- LUCKY FOR US.

295
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,750
( sighs )

296
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,500
( groans )

297
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:54,166
- TENCHI, WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

298
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,708
- HMM?

299
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,541
- DON'T YOU HAVE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO SAY TO SAKUYA?

300
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,541
- WELL, IF I KNEW WHAT
I WANTED TO SAY,

301
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,291
I WOULD HAVE SAID IT
A LONG TIME AGO.

302
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,041
- TENCHI,
THERE'S ALWAYS A WAY,

303
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:07,041
EVEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW OR WHAT.

304
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,916
YOU JUST SAY WHAT YOU REALLY
WANT TO SAY FROM THE HEART.

305
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,083
AND TELL HER WHAT YOU
FEEL INSIDE.  HMM?

306
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,583
- HMM.

307
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,708
- I WAS NO ELOQUENT ROMEO
MYSELF,

308
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:20,708
BUT I DID MANAGE TO SAY WHAT
I HAD TO SAY TO YOUR MOTHER.

309
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,375
- YOU DID?  OH.

310
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,500
- GO ON, SON.
BEHAVE LIKE A MAN.

311
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,458
- MM-HMM.

312
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,416
- ( laughs )

313
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,375
- I WAS WORRIED.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

314
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:40,875
- YEAH, I'M FINE, THANKS.
- OH, GOOD.

315
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:43,208
- SAKUYA--
- I HAVE TO GO.

316
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,958
- WAIT.

317
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:48,125
THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN
MEANING TO TELL YOU.

318
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,708
YOU SEE, IT'S THE ANSWER.

319
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,625
I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU
MY ANSWER YET.

320
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:00,833
- ANSWER?
- TO YOUR QUESTION.

321
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,666
I WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT
I REALLY DON'T KNOW FOR SURE YET

322
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,958
IF I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU.

323
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,750
SO I STILL CAN'T GIVE YOU
ANY DEFINITE ANSWER

324
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,916
'CAUSE I DON'T WANNA LEAD
YOU ON AND GET YOUR HOPES UP,

325
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,375
BUT I WILL PROMISE YOU THIS.

326
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:17,625
I'LL FIND THE ANSWER IF YOU
CAN JUST GIVE ME MORE TIME.

327
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,458
- I'M SORRY.
I WISH--

328
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:31,291
- I'M HAPPY TO SEE YOUR NOSE
ISN'T TWITCHING TODAY.

329
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,166
- HMM?
- AT LEAST YOU'RE HONEST.

330
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,791
I HAVE TO BE
ON MY WAY HOME NOW.

331
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,625
- ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU.
- I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW THEN.

332
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:41,833
BYE, TENCHI.

333
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,416
I ALMOST FORGOT.  PLEASE BE SURE
AND THANK YOUR FATHER

334
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,541
FOR ME, WILL YOU?
- HUH?

335
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:02,375
THANKS, FATHER.
YOU'RE THE BEST. ( sighs )

336
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,125
- LOOKS LIKE THAT'S ABOUT IT,
AT LEAST FOR NOW.

337
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,625
- AND I SAY,
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

338
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:13,625
( laughs )

339
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,083
- I NEED FOOD HERE.

340
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,291
- A NICE MEAL.

341
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,041
- A HOT BATH HERE.

342
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,875
I MEAN, KIYONE,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

343
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,583
- LAUNDRY, COOKING
AND CLEANING.

344
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:31,208
THOSE ARE THE CHORES THAT
HAVE TO BE TAKEN CARE OF.

345
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,250
I'D BETTER GET UP.
THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO.

346
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,958
( panting )
- ( meowing )

347
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,291
- ( theme music playing )

348
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,291
- ( singing in Japanese )

349
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,166
- ( meowing )

350
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:18,208
- HI, I'M WASHU.
A MYSTERIOUS GIRL SHOWS UP

351
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:21,625
OUT OF THE BLUE
IN FRONT OF OUR VERY EYES.

352
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:25,041
HER NAME IS YUGI,
AND SHE IS INCREDIBLE.

353
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:27,625
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
SHE'S SO POWERFUL,

354
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:30,625
SHE KNOCKED RYOKO OUT COLD
WITH ONE BLOW.

355
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,958
WITHOUT TENCHI AROUND
TO HELP US,

356
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,291
I DON'T THINK WE'LL SURVIVE.

357
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:37,958

"TENCHI MUYO" SERIES--
