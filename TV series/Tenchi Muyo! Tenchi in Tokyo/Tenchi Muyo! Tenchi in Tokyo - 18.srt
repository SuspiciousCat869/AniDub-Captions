1
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,458
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,333
- Kiyone: ( chuckles )

4
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:10,625
THIS IS MY BIG CHANCE
TO BOOST MY CAREER.

5
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:12,666
I'M NOT GONNA LET IT
SLIP AWAY.

6
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,375
TURBO SPACESHIP OVER THERE,

7
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,208
HALT AND PULL OVER!

8
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,916
HALT!
- ( grunts )

9
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,916
DANG!
THE GALAXY POLICE.

10
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,041
- UH, KIYONE?

11
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,375
AREN'T YOU TAKING THIS
A BIT TOO FAR?

12
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,625
- JUST WATCH YOUR GAUGES
AND STEER THE SHIP.

13
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,000
- UH, OKAY.

14
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,875
- Kiyone: THIS IS A ONCE IN
A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY.

15
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,708
I'VE GOT TO MAKE IT COUNT.

16
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,041
BENT COUGAR,

17
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,125
THE GALAXY'S MOST WANTED.

18
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,458
CHARGED WITH DESTROYING
FIVE COLONIES

19
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,916
AND BLOWING UP
THREE MILITARY STATIONS.

20
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,583
THIS IS A HUGE CASE,

21
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,750
AND IT'S JUST FALLING
INTO MY LAP!

22
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,000
( laughing )

23
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,333
IF I CATCH HIM,

24
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,625
IT'LL BE THE BIGGEST
FEATHER IN MY CAP YET!

25
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:53,750
AND THEN THEY'LL PUT ME UP
TO HEADQUARTERS FOR SURE. 

26
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,375
I'M GONNA BE BACK ON
THE FAST TRACK

27
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,250
JUST LIKE I ALWAYS
DREAMED OF.

28
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:01,083
THE GLORIOUS LIFE OF A
TOP-RANKED GALAXY  POLICE WOMAN.

29
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,750
( laughs )

30
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,791
( laughing hysterically )

31
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:07,916
- ( whines )

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,750
KIYONE IS TOTALLY
LOSING HER MIND. 

33
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,875
WHOA!
- RIGHT BACK AT YOU!

34
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,291
- OUR SHIELD IS STILL
AT 100%.

35
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:21,083
THE SHIP DOESN'T HAVE
A SCRATCH ON IT, KIYONE.

36
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,833
- WE CAN'T LET
THAT COMMON OUTLAW

37
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,583
STAND IN THE WAY
OF JUSTICE.

38
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,750
I'M ONLY THINKING OF OUR DUTY
AS OFFICERS OF THE LAW,

39
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,083
AND MY PROMOTION
TO HEADQUARTERS.

40
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,291
MIHOSHI, COME ON,
CRANK UP THE POWER.

41
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,583
DON'T LET HIM GET AWAY.

42
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:34,916
- I'M ALL OVER IT.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,250
- HERE COMES MY BIG PROMOTION.

44
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,500
WE WORKED TOGETHER
FOR A GOOD CAUSE! 

45
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:45,500
- Both: OUR SIGNATURE MOVE
IS THE BUDDY KICK!

46
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,708
- Kiyone:
PULL OVER AND STOP!

47
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,750
OR DO I HAVE TO MAKE YOU?

48
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,791
- Bent: SHOO, FLY.
DON'T BOTHER ME.

49
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:52,875
HMM.

50
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,791
THESE SPACE BABES
HAVE GOT GUTS.

51
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,541
I'M AT WARP NINE
AND THEY'RE ON ME

52
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,416
LIKE A TAIL ON A COMET.

53
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,625
IF MY HYPER DRIVE
HADN'T GONE HAYWIRE,

54
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,000
I WOULDN'T HAVE
ENDED UP HERE. 

55
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,958
I NEED SOME MAJOR THRUST
ABOUT NOW.

56
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,958
( grunts )

57
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,333
WHAT WAS THAT?

58
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:08,750
A TRACTOR BEAM?!

59
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,458
- Kiyone:
STOP RESISTING AND GIVE UP.

60
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,291
YOU'RE WASTING OUR TIME.

61
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,875
MIHOSHI,
REVERSE IMPULSE NOW!

62
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,000
I DON'T WANT TO BURN UP
IN THAT ATMOSPHERE.

63
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,416
- I'VE GOT IT COVERED.

64
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,375
- HANG ON, MIHOSHI!
- ( straining )

65
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,208
- Bent: DANG IT!

66
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,166
- Kiyone: I TOLD YOU YOU'RE 
JUST WASTING TIME.

67
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,500
YOU CAN'T GET AWAY.

68
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,583
- ( grunts )

69
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,000
ALL RIGHT, I GIVE.

70
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,166
THE SKIRTS WIN.

71
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,583
- Kiyone:
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT!

72
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,166
BENT COUGAR,
YOU ARE UNDER ARREST

73
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,583
FOR VIOLATION OF  THE UNITED
GALAXY CRIMINAL CODE

74
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,166
SECTION 26!

75
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,208
Kiyone:
MY PROMOTION!  I GOT IT!

76
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,500
- WE DID IT!

77
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,375
WE CAUGHT A REAL BAD GUY.

78
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,375
- THE BIGGEST
FEATHER IN MY CAP.

79
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,708
- OOH, YIPPEE!

80
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,500
- Both: GO POLICE!

81
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,291
- Bent: I'M BURNING UP!

82
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,333
- Mihoshi: AAH!

83
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:03,541
- Kiyone: MIHOSHI,
WHAT'D YOU DO?

84
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,041
- Sasami: ( humming )

85
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,166
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE FISH
GRILLED ON A HIBACHI.

86
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,166
- ( meows )

87
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,375
- ( sniffs )

88
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,041
IT'S STILL THERE.

89
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,041
THAT BURNT SMELL.

90
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,541
I'VE WASHED MY HAIR
SIX TIMES

91
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,375
AND IT STILL 
SMELLS BURNT.

92
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,791
- AND WHO'S FAULT IS THAT?

93
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:25,708
WHO SMACKED THE CONTROLS
SO WE ALMOST BURNED UP

94
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:26,875
IN THE ATMOSPHERE?

95
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,541
- HMM.

96
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:29,708
WAS IT ME?

97
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,083
- NO, IT WAS SANTA CLAUS,

98
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,416
YES, IT WAS YOU,
YOU TWERP!

99
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,083
YOU ALMOST GOT US
BARBECUED, FRIED,

100
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,041
HIBACHIFIED...
- ALL RIGHT, I GET YOUR POINT.

101
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,291
- ...SPACE POLICE!

102
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,208
- I THINK THAT'S WHAT
THEY CALL STRESS.

103
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,541
- ( meows )

104
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,375
- ( gasps )
I FORGOT!

105
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:45,458
I GRILLED ONE
FOR WASHU AGAIN.

106
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,083
( sighs )
- ( meows )

107
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,791
- SHE SAID SHE WAS
GOING INTO THE LAB

108
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,750
AND SHE DIDN'T WANT
ANYONE TO DISTURB HER,

109
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,500
NOT EVEN FOR FOOD.

110
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,583
WHAT DO I DO WITH
THE EXTRA ONE?

111
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,083
I WISH RYOKO WERE HERE.

112
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,750
SHE ALWAYS EATS
THE EXTRAS.

113
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,541
Sasami:
I WONDER WHERE RYOKO IS.

114
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,416
I HOPE SHE'S OKAY.

115
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,750
- ( grunts )

116
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,333
- ( chuckles )
THAT WAS EASY AS PIE.

117
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:19,875
HMM.

118
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,083
AND YOU SAID THAT
THE GUARDS IN THIS BANK

119
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,083
WERE SO TOUGH.

120
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,625
- ( typing )

121
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,791
- SO, DID YOU HACK 
INTO THE VAULT YET?

122
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,458
- JUST GIVE ME 
ANOTHER MINUTE.

123
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,125
I'M SHUTTING DOWN
THE COM RELAYS,

124
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,791
THUS BYPASSING THE SECURITY
SYSTEM'S PHASE PORT.

125
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,791
- YOU'VE GOT GUTS, 
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.

126
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,458
BUT DID YOU REALLY HAVE TO
PICK THE FEDERATION BANK

127
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,125
FOR OUR FIRST ROBBERY?

128
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,291
- ( chuckles )

129
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,791
WELL, NOW THAT WE'RE
PARTNERS IN CRIME,

130
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,791
I WANTED OUR FIRST JOB
TO BE MEMORABLE.

131
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,708
I THOUGHT THIS SHOULD BE
A SPECIAL OCCASION.

132
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,625
ANYWAY, SPACE PIRATES
SHOULD BE BOLD,

133
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,833
DON'T YOU THINK,
PARTNER?

134
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,625
- ( scoffs )
- ( chuckles )

135
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,291
- ALL RIGHT.
SECURITY'S DOWN.

136
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:03,833
SHALL WE GO TO
PHASE TWO, PRINCESS?

137
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,166
- ( grunts )
I'M NOT A PRINCESS.

138
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,750
IN FACT,
I HATE PRINCESSES.

139
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,958
THE PRISSY LITTLE THINGS
MAKE ME WANT TO PUKE.

140
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,333
- ( chuckles )

141
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,291
- WE TOOK OUT
THE GUARDS UPSTAIRS,

142
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,416
BUT SHOULDN'T THERE BE
SOME SENTRIES DOWN HERE?

143
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,833
I KNOW IT'S AFTER HOURS,
BUT EVEN SO...

144
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,000
- ( chuckles )

145
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,666
THEY CAN'T WORK
OVERTIME HERE

146
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,291
EVEN IF THEY WANT TO.
- HUH?

147
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,833
- YOU'LL SEE WHAT I MEAN
IF YOU GO OUT.

148
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,291
BUT I WOULDN'T STEP
OUTSIDE THE FORCE FIELD.

149
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,583
- ( choking )

150
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:36,166
( gasps, pants )
- YOU HAD TO TRY IT, HUH?

151
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,166
- I COULDN'T
BREATHE OUT THERE.

152
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,500
- THERE'S NO OXYGEN.

153
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,000
MAKES IT DIFFICULT
TO INHALE.

154
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,666
- YOU COULD HAVE
TOLD ME THAT!

155
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,833
- WHEN THE BANK CLOSES,
THEY SUCK ALL THE AIR OUT.

156
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,708
IT KEEPS OUT THE RIFF-RAFF.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, DON'T YOU?

157
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,583
- SO MUCH FOR YOUR 
AVERAGE THIEF, HUH?

158
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,583
MOST OF THEM LIKE TO BEATHE
WHILE THEY'RE DOING A JOB.

159
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:53,625
HABIT, I GUESS.

160
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,875
- THIS IS WHERE WE ARE--
RIGHT HERE.

161
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,583
THE MAIN VAULT IS AT
THE END OF THIS HALLWAY.

162
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,375
- WELL, THAT'S VERY CONVENIENT.

163
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,666
I'LL JUST TELEPORT.

164
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,541
UH, UNLESS THEY HAVE
SOME MORE TRICKS WAITING.

165
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,875
- I'M AFRAID THEY DO.

166
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,875
THERE ARE BACKUP SENSORS
WITH A FOUR-WAY ALARM NET.

167
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,208
IF YOU TOUCH ANY ONE
OF THE APERTURES,

168
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,375
YOU'LL BE INSTANTLY
PARALYZED.

169
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,208
THEN BOOM.
ALL THAT'S LEFT OF YOU

170
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,458
IS A LITTLE PILE
OF CHARCOAL.

171
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,041
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

172
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,083
WHAT HAPPENED TO "I SHUT DOWN
THE SECURITY SYSTEM, RYOKO"? 

173
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,458
- OH?

174
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,708
YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF
A BACKUP SYSTEM BEFORE?

175
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,625
I CAN'T SHUT THEM
ALL DOWN AT ONCE.

176
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,500
THERE'S A SECONDARY SYSTEM
AT THE VAULT.

177
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,416
WE CAN'T ACCESS IT
UNTIL WE GET CLOSER.

178
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,083
- THE FEDERATION BANK,
HUH?

179
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,833
THESE GUYS HAVE GOTTEN
PRETTY SERIOUS ABOUT

180
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,416
KEEPING OUT THE BAD GUYS.

181
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,375
- YEAH.
MAKES IT INTERESTING.

182
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,750
JUST BE ALERT,
RYOKO.

183
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,250
IF YOU SET OFF A SENSOR,

184
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,250
THE GALAXY POLICE WILL
BE HERE IN A HOT HURRY

185
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,791
WITH THEIR BIOROID FORCE.
( grunts )

186
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,375
- WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE TALKING TO?

187
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:56,833
SOME GREEN WANNABE?

188
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,083
WHY DO YOU THINK THEY
DEVELOPED THIS SECURITY GRID?

189
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,083
BECAUSE I KNOCKED OFF
EVERY BANK IN SIGHT

190
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,500
THE LAST TIME I CAME
THROUGH THIS GALAXY.

191
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,833
- HMM.

192
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,416
RIGHT, I FORGOT.

193
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,416
SORRY.

194
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,750
- OH, NOW HE'S SORRY.

195
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,250
TOUCHING.

196
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,291
- HMM.

197
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,000
( chuckles )

198
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:20,000
- Ryoko: THIS ALARM SYSTEM
IS RIGHT OUT OF THE STONE AGE.

199
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,083
SHEESH.  IF THAT'S
THE BEST THEY CAN DO,

200
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,875
THEY MIGHT AS WELL JUST
HAND OVER THE CASH.

201
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,666
- THE VAULT'S
BEHIND THAT WALL.

202
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,458
AND SO'S THE DEADLIEST PART
OF THEIR SECURITY NET.

203
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,625
- HMM.  HMM.

204
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,958
THAT CONSOLE OPENS IT UP.

205
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,125
HOW HARD COULD IT BE?

206
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,000
HERE WE GO.
- LET ME DO IT.

207
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,541
- WHY?  I JUST NEED TO 
REARRANGE THE CIRCUITS.

208
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,333
PUT THIS HERE
AND THAT THERE.

209
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,458
UH-HUH.

210
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,875
THIS TAKES TALENT,
I MUST ADMIT.

211
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,291
MAGIC FINGERS
AND ALL THAT.

212
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,333
- ( buzzes )

213
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,708
- HEY, DON'T GET DIFFICULT.

214
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,041
YOU KNOW I'M GONNA
CRACK THIS SYSTEM 

215
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,791
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.
NOW, COME ON.

216
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,791
- ( buzzes )
- UGH!  YOU STUPID MACHINE,

217
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,333
WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DEALING WITH?

218
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,833
- ( buzzing )
- AAH!

219
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:05,000
WHAT'S UP WITH THIS THING?
- ( buzzes )

220
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,625
- AAH!  YOU'RE TRYING TO
MAKE A FOOL OUT OF ME, HUH?!

221
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,333
- Computer: GAME OVER.

222
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,833
- WHAT THE--?!

223
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,916
I'LL SHOW YOU,
YOU PUTRID PILE OF BOLTS!

224
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,541
( grunts )

225
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,916
( chuckles )

226
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,541
WELL, AS I WAS SAYING...

227
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,916
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD
AND OPEN IT?

228
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,208
YOU COULD USE THE PRACTICE.
I'LL JUST SUPERVISE.

229
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,583
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

230
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,000
I'M HONORED BY THIS
GREAT OPPORTUNITY, PRINCESS.

231
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:34,958
- HMM.

232
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,541
NOT BAD.  YOU MADE IT
LOOK LIKE CHILD'S PLAY.

233
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,375
- ALL RIGHT.  LET'S BEGIN.

234
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,333
AFTER YOU.

235
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:50,458
- UH...

236
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:51,458
AH.

237
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,416
- ( chuckles )

238
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,875
YOUR PLAN'S GOING
VERY WELL, HOTSUMA.

239
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,708
IT WON'T BE LONG NOW.

240
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,208
IT'LL HAPPEN SOON.

241
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,541
WHEN THEIR BONDS
ARE COMPLETELY BROKEN,

242
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,541
MY DREAMS WILL
COME TRUE.

243
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,791
THE EARTH WILL THEN BE
MINE FOR THE TAKING.

244
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,250
( chuckles )

245
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,583
- ( meows )

246
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:32,625
( meows )

247
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:37,958
- ( meows )

248
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,541
- WHAT A PAIN BREAKING INTO
EVERY LITTLE VAULT LIKE THIS.

249
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,625
IT'S TOO MUCH TROUBLE.

250
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,541
I'D RATHER ROB 
A WHOLE PLANET.

251
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,666
YOU TAKE EVERYTHING AT ONCE
AND GET OUT OF DODGE.

252
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,125
I'LL ADMIT,
IT'S AN EGO TRIP,

253
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,458
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
QUITE AS EXCITING. 

254
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,208
- HAVE A LITTLE PATIENCE.

255
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,791
THERE ARE SOME TREASURES
THAT ARE WORTH THE EXTRA EFFORT,

256
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,833
AND TREASURE COMES
IN MANY FORMS.

257
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:01,166
- HMM.

258
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,833
- ALL RIGHT, I'M IN.
YOU READY?

259
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,833
- UH-HUH.

260
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,125
WELL, NOTHING'S HAPPENING.

261
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,166
- GREETINGS, I AM A
SINGING HOLOGRAM,

262
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,250
PART OF THE FAIL-SAFE
SECURITY FORCE.

263
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,166
YOU'VE ATTEMPTED

00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,625

AND OPEN UP

275
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,875
BEFORE I LOSE MY
MUSICAL APPRECIATION.

276
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,208
- BUT THAT'S AGAINST
REGULATIONS.

277
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,000
I'M PROGRAMMED TO
REQUIRE I.D.

278

RIGHT HERE, PAL.

YOU HOLOGRAMS GIVE ME
A PAIN IN THE NECK.

280
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,333
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
THAT PROGRAMMING

281
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,666
JAMMED DOWN YOUR
REFRACTION BRAIN,

282
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,083
YOU LITTLE PHOTONIC TWIT!

283
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,333
OPEN UP THAT VAULT
<i>MACH SCHNELL,</i>

284
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,875
YOU HEAR ME?
OPEN IT OR I'LL--

285
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,708
( gasps )

286
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:59,708
UH, I MEANT, "HI DARLING.

287
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,333
DO PLEASE OPEN UP."

288
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,000
- I.D. CODE CONFIRMED.

289
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,000
HARD SLAP LEFT, RIGHT,
LEFT, RIGHT, AND LEFT.

290
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,333
REPEAT SEQUENCE.

291
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:08,625
CODE WORDS:
"HI, DARLING.

292
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:09,833
WOULD YOU PLEASE OPEN UP?"

293
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,166
PROTOCOLS INITIATED.

294
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,166
MAIN VAULT IS NOW UNLOCKED.
HAVE A NICE DAY.

295
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,583
- ( groans )
- ( chuckles )

296
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,791
- ( siren beeping )

297
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,333
- AH.  WELCOME TO
THE INNER SANCTUM

298
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,708
OF THE FEDERATION BANK.

299
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,375
WELL, THIS IS DIFFERENT.

300
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,375
- YES.  SURPRISE.

301
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,125
- SO TELL ME,
IS IT MY IMAGINATION OR...

302
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,375
- ( chuckles )

303
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,708
- IS THAT THING
A BLACK HOLE?

304
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,666
- YES, IT'S A SYNTHETIC
SINGULARITY,

305
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,250
VERY SOPHISTICATED.

306
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,916
IT'S CALLED
A MICRO BLACK HOLE. 

307
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,875
- MICRO BLACK HOLE?
THAT'S NEW.

308
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,875
- IT'S ARTIFICIALLY ENGINEERED,

309
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,125
NOT COMPARABLE TO
A REAL ONE, OF COURSE,

310
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,583
BUT IT CAN GENERATE
A 30% POWER WARP

311
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,166
WITH MACRO-STATIC
GRAVITONICS.

312
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,875
ENOUGH TO BEND 
REALITY ITSELF.

313
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,875
I'D HEARD THEY HAD
SOME PROTOTYPES,

314
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,208
BUT I NEVER THOUGHT THEY'D
USE ONE TO GUARD A VAULT. 

315
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,250
TECHNOLOGY
IN DEFENSE OF PROPERTY.

316
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,958
IT'S AN AGE-OLD CONCEPT,

317
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,375
AND IT COULD HAVE
VERY EXPLOSIVE RESULTS.

318
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:10,708
THESE BANK BOYS THINK BIG.

319
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,916
- AND HOW ARE WE
GONNA STEAL SOMETHING

320
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,916
THAT'S ENCASED WITH
A BLACK HOLE?

321
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,166
- IT'S GOING TO
BE A CHALLENGE,

322
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,166
BUT I LIKE CHALLENGES,
DON'T YOU?

323
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,708
- ( gasps )
- THE GREATER THE CHALLENGE,

324
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:23,041
THE GREATER THE TRIUMPH
WHEN WE SUCCEED.

325
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,500
YES, THIS IS THE WAY
OF BLOOD AND GLORY. 

326
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,750
- HMM.

327
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:28,875
- HM?

328
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,458
LOOK OUT!
- ( grunts )

329
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,791
- AAH!
- WHAT'S THAT?

330
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,750
IT'S THE BIOROID FORCE.

331
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,791
THEY DEFLECTED
MY PHOTON BLASTS.

332
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,291
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE
WARPING REALITY SOMEHOW.

333
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,291
- IT'S NOT THEM.
IT'S THE MICRO-BLACK HOLE.

334
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,125
- HOTSUMA,
ARE YOU OKAY?

335
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,166
YOU'RE HIT.

336
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,458
- ( chuckles )

337
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,000
RYOKO...

338
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:01,458
YOU HAVE FINALLY
TREATED ME LIKE A PARTNER.

339
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:02,416
- ( gasps )

340
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:08,916
YOU'RE A FOOL.

341
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,083
WHY'D YOU JUMP IN THE WAY
OF THAT LASER BLAST?

342
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,791
I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO
TAKE ONE FOR ME, DID I?

343
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,958
- I JUST DID
WHAT HAD TO BE DONE.

344
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,625
WHAT ANYONE WOULD DO...

345
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,708
FOR A PARTNER, AND A
MAGNIFICENT PARTNER TO BOOT.

346
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:21,916
- ( murmurs )

347
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,166
- ( grunts )

348
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,375
TRY TO BUY SOME TIME.

349
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,541
- HOTSUMA...

350
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,958
- JUST ONE MINUTE,
THAT'S ALL I NEED.

351
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,166
THAT PANEL CONTROLS
THE BLACK HOLE.

352
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,666
I'LL DISENGAGE THE CONNECTORS
AT THE MAIN CONDUIT

353
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,500
AND GET EVERYTHING
READY FOR TAKEOFF.

354
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,666
MEANWHILE, I WANT YOU
TO KEEP THEM AT BAY. 

355
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,166
WE JUST NEED
A LITTLE MORE TIME.

356
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,500
CAN YOU HOLD THEM OFF?

357
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,458
- YES.  I'LL DO IT.

358
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,833
( exhales )

359
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,500
- THIS IS OUR FIRST 
JOB TOGETHER, RYOKO.

360
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,833
NO MATTER HOW MANY OF THEM
THERE ARE, WE CAN BEAT THEM.

361
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:58,875
- ( gasps )

362
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,583
- I'M COUNTING ON YOU,
PARTNER.

363
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,708
- OH.

364
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,291
( chuckles )

365
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,375
ALL RIGHT.  LET'S PLAY.

366
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,416
THIS'LL BE FUN.

367
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,250
IN FACT, IT'S GONNA
BE A BLAST.

368
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,750
HAA!

369
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,875
( grunts )

370
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,375
THIS IS TOO EASY.

371
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,041
( laughs )

372
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,500
ALLOW ME TO
INTRODUCE MYSELF.

373
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,666
I AM RYOKO,
THE SPACE PIRATE.

374
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:48,875
- ( grunts )

375
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,541
- HA!

376
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,083
BIOROID ENFORCERS.

377
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,000
( laughs )

378
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,666
YOU GUYS ARE IN NEED
OF A FACTORY RECALL.

379
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,916
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT EVEN
WORTHY OPPONENTS.

380
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,791
HA!
( grunts )

381
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,250
WHO'S NEXT?

382
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,416
COME ON, GUYS.

383
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,208
YOU WANT SOME TROUBLE?!

384
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,583
- GYAN!

385
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,625
- YES, SIR?

386
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,500
- GET US OUT OF HERE.

387
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,291
- WHAT-- WHAT'S THAT?
DAMN.

388
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,958
- WE HAVE GOT A MAJOR
FLEET APPROACHING, SIR.

389
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,291
GALAXY POLICE.

390
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,291
- IT'S A RAPID 
RESPONSE FORCE.

391
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,375
- THIS IS THE GALAXY POLICE.

392
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,708
YOU ARE IN AN
UNAUTHORIZED AREA.

393
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:51,958
SHUT DOWN IMMEDIATELY.

394
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,416
REPEAT, SHUT DOWN.

395
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,583
- ( grunting )

396
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:55,916
- SMOKE 'EM, GYAN.

397
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,875
- YES, SIR.

398
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,000
- OH, NO.  THEY HIT
THE MICRO-BLACK HOLE.

399
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,416
THE MONEY'S ALL GONE!

400
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,166
- OKAY.

401
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,291
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,

402
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,333
YOU WIN SOME, YOU LOSE SOME,
RIGHT?

403
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:16,833
- I WOULDN'T SAY THAT.

404
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,333
THIS IS WORTH A FORTUNE.

405
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,958
THE CURRENCY'S FROM JURAI.

406
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,958
- ( growls )
AYEKA!

407
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,625
I DON'T WANT THIS
STUPID MONEY.

408
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,375
( grunting )

409
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,666
- ( chuckles )

410
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,833
- YOU KNOW WHAT, HOTSUMA?
- HUH?

411
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,333
- I HAVEN'T HAD
THAT MUCH FUN IN AGES.

412
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:35,500
YOU WERE RIGHT.

413
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,208
THIS IS THE LIFE
I WAS MEANT FOR.

414
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,500
PIRATING AND BLOWING
THOSE ROBOTS AWAY.

415
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:42,958
IT WAS GREAT.

416
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,875
- YOU ARE EVERYTHING
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE

417
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:45,875
AND THEN SOME.

418
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,208
RYOKO, THIS IS
YOUR DESTINY. 

419
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,666
THERE'S NO QUESTION
ABOUT THAT.

420
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,875
YOU WERE BORN FOR IT.

421
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,583
- HOW'S YOUR WOUND?

422
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,583
- IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
JUST A SCRATCH.

423
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,208
RYOKO...
- HMM?

424
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,125
- DID I PASS YOUR TEST?

425
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,375
AM I GOOD ENOUGH
TO BE YOUR PARTNER?

426
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,375
- WE'LL SEE.

427
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:13,708
( chuckles )

428
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,791
- Kiyone:
ALL RIGHT!  I'VE DONE IT!

429
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,208
YEAH!

430
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,041
- Sasami: A PROMOTION?

431
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,375
- YES!  I JUST
HEARD FROM HEADQUARTERS.

432
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,208
REMEMBER WHEN WE ARRESTED
THAT CRIMINAL, BENT COUGAR?

433
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,458
- WELL, THEY RECOGNIZED
OUR EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE

434
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,916
AND WE ARE NOW PROMOTED
TO SPECIAL CLASS DETECTIVES!

435
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,250
- THAT'S GREAT!

436
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,166
CONGRATULATIONS,
YOU TWO.

437
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,083
- Ayeka:
YES, WE'RE VERY PROUD OF YOU.

438
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,750
- Kiyone: THANK YOU SO MUCH.

439
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,375
BUT THAT'S NOT
THE WHOLE STORY.

440
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,416
GUESS WHAT?
WE'VE BEEN REASSIGNED

441
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,833
TO A NEW GALAXY POLICE STATION
ON PLUTO!

442
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,708
YEAH!
( laughs )

443
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,416
I'M VERY HAPPY.
- HUH?

444
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,083
- YOU MEAN YOU'RE
MOVING AWAY?

445
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,291
- ( crying )
I DON'T WANT TO GO, KIYONE!

446
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,083
I WANT TO STAY HERE
WITH MY FRIENDS.

447
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,291
THIS IS A DISASTER.

448
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,291
- WELL, OF COURSE
I'LL MISS EVERYONE TOO,

449
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,958
BUT WE'RE POLICE OFFICERS.

450
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,625
WE HAVE TO FIGHT
FOR JUSTICE

451
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,083
AND YOU KNOW,
STUFF LIKE THAT.

452
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,666
ANYWAY, ORDERS ARE ORDERS.

453
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,250
- OFFICER KIYONE,

454
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,916
WHEN DO YOU REPORT IN
FOR YOUR NEW ASSIGNMENT?

455
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,166
- THAT WOULD BE TODAY!
THIS AFTERNOON IN A FEW HOURS.

456
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,333
- ( crying )

457
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,666
- ( phone ringing )

458
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,416
- Tenchi: HI, I'M UNABLE
TO ANSWER YOUR CALL RIGHT NOW.

459
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,458
PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE
AFTER THE BEEP.

460
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:30,750
- ( beeps )

461
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,208
- Kiyone:
WAS HE THERE, MIHOSHI?

462
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,208
- Mihoshi: NO, HE DIDN'T ANSWER.
HE MUST BE OUT.

463
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,250
- Kiyone: WELL, I GUESS
AYEKA CAN TELL TENCHI

464
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,166
ABOUT OUR NEW ASSIGNMENT.

465
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,625
GO IN AND PACK.
HURRY.

466
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,250
- Mihoshi: ( blubbers )

467
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:47,000
- Kiyone: YEAH, IT'S GREAT
TO BE BACK INSIDE A BIG SHIP.

468
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:51,208
- Mihoshi: GOOD-BYE, EVERYONE.
DON'T FORGET ABOUT US.  BYE.

469
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,333
I DON'T WANT TO GO.
WHAT AM I DOING DO 

470
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,375
SO FAR AWAY FROM
ALL MY FRIENDS? 

471
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,458
- ( meows )

472
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,041
- EVERYTHING'S...

473
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,791
JUST SO QUIET.

474
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,791
- SASAMI, YOU ARE
AN AMAZING COOK. 

475
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,000
THIS SNAPPER'S JUST SUPERB.
DELICIOUS.

476
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,833
YUM, YUM.
I THINK I'LL HAVE SECONDS.

477
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,833
MAYBE THIRDS.
OH, I BROKE MY CHOPSTICK.

478
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,166
- OH...

479
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,666
- Ayeka: WHY?
WHY IS ALL THIS HAPPENING TO US?

480
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,333
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

481
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,833
- EVERYTHING WAS FINE.

482
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,166
AND THEN IN JUST
A FEW MONTHS,

483
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,166
WE'VE ALL DRIFTED APART.

484
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,541
I FEEL LOST.

485
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,166
- Katsuhito: HMM.

486
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,833
THIS IS SURELY A PORTENT.

487
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,833
SOMETHING EVIL IS COMING.

488
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,208
- ( theme music playing )

489
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

490
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,541
- ( meows )

491
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:10,083
( meows )

492
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:14,166
- Sasami:
HI, IT'S ME, SASAMI.

493
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,291
LISTEN, TENCHI,

494
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:17,666
OUR HOUSE HAS BEEN
SO EMPTY LATELY.

495
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,333
GEE, I MISS RYOKO AND MIHOSHI,

496
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:23,416
AND WELL... EVERYONE.

497
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,166
THEY'VE ALL GONE AWAY.

498
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,125
EVEN AYEKA'S NOT
THE SAME THESE DAYS.

499
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,625
I'M WORRIED, TENCHI.

500
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,916
I'M AFRAID WE'RE ALL
DRIFTING APART.

501
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,125
WHAT AM I GONNA DO,
TENCHI?

502
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:38,250
THE NEXT EPISODE OF
THE NEW TENCHI MUYO SERIES,
