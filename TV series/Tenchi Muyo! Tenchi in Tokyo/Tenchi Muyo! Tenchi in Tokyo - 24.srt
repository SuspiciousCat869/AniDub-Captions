1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,916
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:45,583
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,958
- ( telephone ringing )

4
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,541
- OH.  I FELL ASLEEP.

5
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,625
GOSH.  HUH?

6
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:28,458
- Hi.  Sorry, but I'm out
right now.

7
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:29,833
Leave a message.  Bye.
- OH, YEAH.

8
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,666
GOOD THING I DIDN'T
TURN OFF THE ANSWERING MACHINE.

9
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,875
- ( machine beeps )

10
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:33,958
- Tenchi: Sakuya, it's me.
- ( gasps )

11
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,458
- Tenchi.

12
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:38,166
Well, I went to your place
yesterday, but you weren't home.

13
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,625
I just wanted to make sure you
were all right and everything.

14
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,666
- OH, HE CAME ALL THE WAY HERE
TO CHECK ON ME.

15
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,625
- Well, I guess I'll
try again later.

16
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,875
- Bye.
- ( gasps ) TENCHI, WAIT!

17
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,375
- WHOA, SAKUYA!
- ( chuckles ) Hi.

18
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:51,041
I-- I just got in. Was there
something you wanted to tell me?

19
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:54,208
- WELL, YEAH.
I WAS JUST WONDERING, UH...

20
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,583
Do you wanna get together
tomorrow?

21
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,583
- ( exhales )
THAT'D BE GREAT.

22
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,041
MM.  WHEN, TENCHI?

23
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:02,208
- HOW ABOUT 10? I'LL MEET
YOU AT OUR REGULAR SPOT

24
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,458
AT THE FAR END
OF THE PARK.

25
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,083
- ALL RIGHT.
THAT SOUNDS PERFECT.

26
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,625
I'LL BE THERE AT 10, SHARP.
I CAN'T WAIT, TENCHI.

27
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:11,291
- YEAH.  ME NEITHER.
SO I'LL SEE YOU THEN.  BYE.

28
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,416
- YOU DID IT.

29
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,125
YOU PUT ALL THE PIECES
TOGETHER, WASHU.

30
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,291
- OH, I KNEW THAT.

31
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,958
( moans )

32
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,625
- ( bones cracking )

33
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:51,958
- ( exhales )

34
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:55,125
YEAH, I CAN SEE THE WHOLE
PICTURE NOW, KATSUHITO.

35
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:58,125
- THEN YOU'RE GOING TO
TOKYO, I TAKE IT?

36
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,125
- YES, AND THERE'S NO TIME
TO WASTE, EITHER.

37
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,458
I'VE GOT TO LET TENCHI KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

38
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,000
- I'M GOING WITH YOU, WASHU.

39
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,250
- EH...

40
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,125
- I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN
THERE WOULD COME A DAY

41
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,125
WHEN TENCHI WOULD LEARN
OF HIS TRUE DESTINY,

42
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,125
AND THAT DAY IS HERE.

43
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:14,083
IT IS MY DUTY AS THE HEAD
OF THE MASAKI CLAN.

44
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,458
I MUST PASS THIS KNOWLEDGE
ON TO TENCHI.

45
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,166
- WELL, YOU'RE THE BOSS.

46
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,666
LET'S HIT IT.

47
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,791
- ( birds chirping,
twittering )

48
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,500
- TENCHI'S LATE.

49
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,125
- SAKUYA, OVER HERE!

50
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,916
- ( gasps )
OH!

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,583
HI, THERE.

52
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,541
- ( panting )

53
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:48,916
HI.

54
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,958
GEEZ, SORRY TO BE LATE.

55
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,791
- MM.  IT'S OKAY.

56
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,625
I ONLY GOT HERE
A MINUTE AGO MYSELF.

57
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,125
- I'M GLAD YOU MADE IT.
 WHERE DO YOU WANNA GO?

58
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,666
UM... GEE, COME TO
THINK OF IT,

59
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,666
I'VE NEVER EVEN
ASKED YOU OUT BEFORE,

60
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,041
SO THIS ONE WILL BE
A FIRST!

61
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,083
UH, LET'S SEE.

62
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,375
THERE MUST BE SOMEWHERE.

63
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,041
MM...

64
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,333
- YOU KNOW, TENCHI...
- HUH?

65
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:14,000
- ...MAYBE IT WASN'T SUCH
A GOOD IDEA GETTING TOGETHER.

66
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,833
- LET'S WALK TOWARDS
THE STATION.

67
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,333
COME ON.
WE'LL FIGURE OUT SOMETHING.

68
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,333
- TENCHI--

69
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,750
UH, TENCHI,
WAIT A MINUTE.

70
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,208
- HUH?

71
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,541
- I KNOW WHAT I WANNA DO.

72
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,750
WHY DON'T WE GO
TO THE BEACH?

73
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,375
- YEAH!
THAT'LL BE GREAT.

74
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:37,833
- YEAH.

75
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,541
- GIVE IT UP ALREADY.
YOU'RE OUTCLASSED.

76
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,791
HA!  A MAN SHOULD KNOW 
WHEN HE'S LOST A FIGHT.

77
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,416
- SORRY, BABE. I HATE TO
GET ROUGH WITH A DELICATE

78
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,208
SPACE CHICK LIKE YOU,
BUT THEN AGAIN, YOU SEE,

79
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,083
I JUST CAN'T LET YOU
GO BACK TO EARTH.

80
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,583
MY MISSION IS TO KEEP YOU
AWAY FROM TENCHI.

81
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:15,583
- AND JUST HOW ARE YOU
PLANNING TO ACCOMPLISH THAT?

82
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,666
- ( growls )

83
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,833
- THIS ISN'T JEALOUSLY.

84
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,291
TO BE JEALOUS,
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HEART,

85
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,458
WHICH LEAVES YOU OUT.
SO TELL ME...

86
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,041
WHAT'S GOING ON
BACK ON EARTH? 

87
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,458
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO PULL?!

88
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,958
- HA.  YOU KNOW,
IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER

89
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,625
'CAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO
DIE RIGHT HERE ANYWAY,

90
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:32,916
AND THAT'LL BE
THE END OF IT.

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,791
- AH, THERE'S
THE OVERCONFIDENCE.

92
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,583
OF COURSE, IT'S A SURE SIGN
OF A CLASSIC SPACE THUG.

93
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,500
WELL, I'M THROUGH
PLAYING WITH YOU.

94
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,500
AS THE SAYING GOES,
MAKE MY DAY.

95
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:44,916
- ( grunting )

96
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,833
HUH?  WHAT?

97
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,500
- HA!

98
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,125
- ( grunts )

99
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,666
( groaning )

100
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,958
- ( laughing )

101
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:09,166
OH, WHERE'S ALL THAT
CONFIDENCE NOW, LOVER BOY?

102
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,833
- ( groaning )
BEWARE...

103
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,416
- WHAT THE--?!

104
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:19,958
- ( growling )

105
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:25,083
HOW DO YOU LIKE
YOUR LOVER NOW, RYOKO?

106
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,416
- MATORI, SHOW YOURSELF.

107
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,041
- IS THAT WHAT YOU HAD IN MIND?
- YES.

108
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,791
THE TIME HAS FINALLY ARRIVED.

109
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,500
THIS PLANET IS GOING
TO BE MINE,

110
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:44,625
AND ALL OF MY DREAMS AND PLANS
ARE ABOUT TO COME TRUE.

111
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,583
- HOW PLEASANT FOR YOU.

112
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,083
- BUT THERE'S ONE THING.
- HMM?

113
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,041
- SASAMI.

114
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:54,250
I WANT YOU TO BRING HER
HERE TO ME.

115
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,250
- REALLY?  ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANNA DO THAT?

116
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,416
THINK ABOUT IT, YUGI.

117
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,708
SHE MAY LOOK LIKE
A SWEET LITTLE GIRL,

118
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,875
BUT REMEMBER, SHE'S STILL
ONE OF OUR ENEMIES.

119
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,416
SHE'LL NEVER BE LOYAL
TO YOU.

120
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,125
I'D SAY IT'S BETTER
TO ANNIHILATE HER

121
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,458
ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHERS.

122
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:10,125
- ( grunts )
- OOH...

123
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:13,125
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

124
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,083
( giggles )

125
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,458
- NOW!

126
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,583
- THIS BEACH IS SO BEAUTIFUL.

127
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,083
- YEAH, IT'S GREAT.

128
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,875
- THANKS, TENCHI,
FOR BRINGING ME HERE.

129
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,333
THE BREEZE IS SO NICE.

130
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,916
AND SOMEHOW
WHEN I'M WITH YOU,

131
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,833
EVERYTHING SEEMS OKAY.

132
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,291
I DON'T KNOW WHY,
BUT I FEEL LIKE

133
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,125
I'VE BEEN ALONE
FOR A LONG LONG TIME.

134
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,958
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

135
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,458
- YEAH, SURE.

136
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:56,916
- YOU KNOW WHAT, TENCHI?

137
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,958
- HUH?

138
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:08,625
- ( softly chuckles )

139
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,958
NOW I HAVE SOMETHING
TO REMEMBER.

140
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,000
I DON'T HAVE MANY MEMORIES
FROM THE PAST,

141
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,666
BUT I CAN CREATE NEW ONES
FOR THE FUTURE, RIGHT?

142
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,625
- MMM.  MM-HMM.

143
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,625
- TENCHI?

144
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,000
LET'S TAKE A WALK.
COME ON.

145
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,041
- HEY!  YOU WRECKED
OUR SPACESHIP.

146
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,625
- THAT'S DANGEROUS, YOU KNOW?

147
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,291
- I WON'T HARM YOU IF YOU
GIVE YOURSELF UP RIGHT NOW!

148
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,125
BUT IF YOU RESIST ARREST,
YOU'LL BE REALLY SORRY.

149
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,833
- I DON'T THINK WE CAN
ARREST SOMEONE

150
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,291
WHEN WE'RE ON VACATION, KIYONE.

151
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,458
IT'S AGAINST REGULATIONS,
REMEMBER?

152
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:54,166
- ( sighs )
HE SHOT OUR SPACESHIP DOWN.

153
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,041
I DON'T GIVE A DARN
ABOUT REGULATIONS, MIHOSHI.

154
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,125
GOT IT?

155
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,875
YOU HAVE RUINED OUR VACATION!

156
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,875
- OH, I'M SORRY.
I FORGOT IT'S SUMMER.

157
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,208
I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE WAITED.
I JUST WASN'T THINKING.

158
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,750
- WHO ARE YOU, ANYWAY?!
I REMEMBER YOU

159
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,000
FROM THE MASAKI SHRINE
WHEN WE WERE ATTACKED.

160
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:09,708
YOU HELPED US OUT.

161
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,458
- YEAH, THAT WAS FUN.

162
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,458
BUT I'M AFRAID
I'M SWITCHING SIDES AGAIN.

163
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,416
IT'S KIND OF A BAD HABIT
OF MINE, YOU KNOW?

164
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,125
I'VE GOT ORDERS FROM YUGI 
TO OBLITERATE BOTH OF YOU.

165
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,833
- UH, YUGI?
- AAH!

166
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,750
SO YOU'RE WORKING FOR YUGI?

167
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,166
WHAT'S THE LITTLE PIPSQUEAK
TRYING TO PULL OFF NOW?

168
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,000
- AAH!  OH!

169
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,208
- YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW?
OKAY, I'LL TELL YOU.

170
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,166
IF YOU CAN DEFEAT ME
IN BATTLE.

171
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,125
- FINE!  JUST DON'T SAY
I DIDN'T WARN YOU.

172
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,875
- ( laughing )

173
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,333
IS THAT THE BEST
YOU CAN DO?

174
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,291
- ( groaning )

175
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,208
- MIHOSHI, QUIT SPACING OUT.

176
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,208
WOULD YOU HELP ME
SHOOT THIS GUY?

177
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,500
- UH, ALL RIGHT.

178
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,208
- ( grunts )

179
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,250
- ( laughing )

180
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,375
AAH!

181
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,041
- HA!  LOOK, I GOT HIM.

182
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,041
- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

183
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,125
- UHH, I HAD THIS FEELING
SOMETHING MAJOR WAS GOING

184
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,708
TO HAPPEN TODAY, BUT, UH...

185
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,666
I GUESS I WAS TOTALLY WRONG.

186
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,500
AAH.
- HI, TENCHI.

187
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,500
- ( meows )

188
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,333
- DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME
SOMETHING, GRANDPA?

189
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,291
YOU MUST HAVE COME HERE
FOR A REASON.

190
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,333
SO, YOU KNOW?

191
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,500
- YEAH.
I FIGURED.

192
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,041
- HMM.

193
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:56,208
- WELL, WHY DON'T I
GET THINGS STARTED?

194
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,458
HERE.

195
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,541
YOU REMEMBER THE BATTLE
AT THE MASAKI SHRINE?

196
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,416
AS A RESULT OF THAT,
EVERYONE GOT SCATTERED

197
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,250
AROUND THE GALAXY, RIGHT?

198
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,500
- YEAH.

199
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,416
- I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT THEY HAD IN MIND.

200
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,916
IT'S THE WHOLE POINT
OF THEIR PLAN.

201
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,083
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

202
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,833
LORD TENCHI, DO YOU 
REMEMBER THIS PLACE?

203
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,916
- THAT'S THE RUIN
IN NORTHERN OKUTAMA.

204
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,791
I WENT THERE
ON A SCHOOL FIELD TRIP.

205
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,541
- WELL, THOSE RUINS
 AREN'T FROM EARTH.

206
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,458
I FOUND OUT WHERE THEY
REALLY CAME FROM.

207
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,958
IT'S JURAI.

208
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,208
- YOU MEAN THE SAME PLANET
THAT AYEKA AND SASAMI ARE FROM?

209
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,541
IS THAT POSSIBLE?

210
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,250
- YES.  THEY WERE SENT
TO EARTH A LONG TIME AGO.

211
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,583
- WHY WOULD THEY SEND
A RUIN TO ANOTHER PLANET?

212
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,000
- IT'S MORE THAN A RUIN.
WHAT YOU THOUGHT WAS A TOMB

213
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,500
IS ACTUALLY AN ADVANCED
CRYOGENIC CAPSULE

214
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,125
THAT CAN KEEP A FROZEN ENTITY
ALIVE FOR CENTURIES.

215
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,708
- BUT THERE WAS NO ENTITY.
NO ONE WAS IN THERE.

216
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,708
- I WONDER WHY THAT IS.
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU

217
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:46,083
A DEMON CHILD ESCAPED FROM IT,
AND NOW SHE'S AFTER YOU, TENCHI?

218
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,791
- ARE YOU SAYING SHE'S THE ONE
WHO ATTACKED THE SHRINE?!

219
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,791
- YES.  I DID A TIME SCAN
ON HER ORGANIC FLUCTUATION

220
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,625
SO I COULD FOLLOW HER
INTO THE PAST.

221
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,333
THEY LED ME
RIGHT TO THAT TOMB.

222
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,875
I'M SURE SHE WAS THE ONE
BEHIND THAT KAMIBITO INCIDENT

223
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,333
AND LOTS OF OTHER MAYHEM TOO.

224
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,041
- WHO IS THIS DEMON CHILD?!

225
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,208
- SOMEONE YOU ALREADY KNOW.

226
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,750
YOU'RE QUITE WELL-ACQUAINTED,
IN FACT.

227
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,000
- HUH?

228
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,916
- HER NAME IS YUGI.

229
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,333
- YUGI!

230
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,375
- YEAH, YUGI.

231
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,875
- YOU MEAN THAT LITTLE GIRL
THAT WAS PLAYING WITH SASAMI?

232
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,041
COME OFF IT! YOU
DON'T REALLY EXPECT ME

233
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,791
TO BELIEVE THAT
THAT GIRL'S A DEMON.

234
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,666
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE
MY WORD FOR IT.

235
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,625
JUST LOOK AT THESE BIO-FILES
I DOWNLOADED FROM THE ROYAL

236
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,458
DATABANKS ON JURAI.
SHE WAS AN EXPERIMENT.

237
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,583
A MUTANT CREATED BY
THE JURAI ROYAL FAMILY

238
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,000
3,500 YEARS AGO.

239
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,666
- MUTANT?
- SHE WAS DESIGNED

240
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,708
AND DEVELOPED
TO HAVE SPECIAL PSYCHIC POWERS

241
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,541
TO A SUPER-ENERGY CALLED
"THE POWER OF JURAI."

242
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,916
BUT THE POWER WAS TOO
GREAT FOR HER CHILDISH

243
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,208
MIND TO CONTROL.

244
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,166
YUGI SPREAD TERROR
ACROSS JURAI,

245
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,166
TRYING TO CREATE
HER OWN EMPIRE.

246
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,625
SO THE ROYAL FAMILY
TRAPPED HER IN A CRYOGENIC

247
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:56,000
CAPSULE TO DEPORT HER FOREVER,
TO WANDER ACROSS THE STARS

248
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,958
IN THE REMOTEST CORNER
OF THE UNIVERSE.

249
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,458
- AND THEN AFTER TRAVELING
ACROSS THE UNIVERSE,

250
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,250
SHE CAME DOWN TO EARTH
BY ACCIDENT?

251
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,583
- RIGHT. AND SHE
WANTS TO REALIZE

252
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:08,833
HER DREAM HERE ON EARTH--

253
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,208
THE DREAM THAT SHE
COULDN'T REALIZE ON JURAI.

254
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,083
TO CREATE HER OWN EMPIRE.

255
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,916
- BUT I STILL DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

256
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,083
WHY IS SHE AFTER ME
AND MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY?!

257
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,500
WHY IS SHE TRYING
TO SEPARATE US?

258
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,166
- HERE'S THE REASON
RIGHT HERE.

259
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,416
- THOSE ARE KEEPSAKES
FROM MY MOTHER.

260
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,833
WHA--

261
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:29,250
- IT'S TIME YOU LEARN THE TRUTH
ABOUT THE GEMS, MY SON.

262
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,916
- GEE, I WONDER
IF HE'S HOME BY NOW.

263
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
TENCHI...

264
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,625
- PLANET GUARDIANS?

265
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,000
- UH-HUH.
THE PLANET GUARDIANS' MISSION

266
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,000
IS TO PROTECT THE PLANET
FROM EVIL.

267
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:52,000
WE OF THE MASAKI CLAN HAVE
CARRIED ON THAT HONORABLE TASK

268
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,375
FOR MANY GENERATIONS.

269
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,291
WE HAVE SERVED LOYALLY,

270
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,333
OPERATING BEHIND THE SCENES,

271
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:00,083
BATTLING EVIL FORCES
WHEN AND WHEREVER NECESSARY,

272
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,958
PROTECTING THIS PLANET 
THROUGHOUT ITS HISTORY.

273
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,958
THESE GEMS HAVE BEEN
PASSED DOWN

274
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,666
AS SYMBOLS
OF OUR SACRED MISSION.

275
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,875
- BUT I NEVER KNEW THEY HELD
SO MANY SECRETS AND MYSTERIES.

276
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,583
- THEIR POWER
IS A CRYSTALLIZATION

277
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,958
OF THE EARTH'S
ORGANIC ENERGY.  SEE?

278
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,625
IF I TRIED TO USE IT,
IT DOESN'T HAVE MUCH EFFECT.

279
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,291
BUT FOR AN ENTITY WHOSE ENERGY
IS NATURALLY SYNCHRONIZED

280
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:21,625
WITH THIS PLANET,

281
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,833
IT WILL UNLEASH TREMENDOUS
KINETIC FORCE AND POWER.

282
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,875
- ARE THESE ENTITIES
THE MASAKIS?

283
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,208
- MM.  YOUR CLAN, TENCHI.

284
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,000
- BUT WHY'S IT GLOWING?

285
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,416
- TO WARN YOU.
- HMM?

286
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,250
- WHEN ALL THE GEMS ARE
TOGETHER, THEIR ENERGY COMBINES,

287
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,541
CREATING A DEEP MYSTICAL AURA
THAT WARDS OFF EVIL.

288
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,083
BUT NOW THAT THE GEMS
ARE APART,

289
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,750
THEIR POWER HAS BEEN WEAKENED,

290
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,375
LEAVING THE EARTH EXPOSED
AND VULNERABLE.

291
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,541
- AAH, THAT'S WHY SHE WANTED
TO SPLIT US UP,

292
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:46,750
BECAUSE OF THE GEMS!

293
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,333
- MM.

294
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,041
- YOU HEARD THE NEWS REPORTS,
HAVEN'T YOU?

295
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,541
- YOU MEAN ABOUT
THOSE PLASMIC DISTURBANCES?

296
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,000
- UH-HUH.
THAT'S YUGI'S EMPIRE.

297
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,458
ALTHOUGH, THEY'RE
STILL TECHNICALLY

298
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:57,958
IN A DIFFERENT DIMENSION,

299
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,833
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME
UNTIL THE BARRIERS BREAK DOWN.

300
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,333
THEN THEY'LL BE A PART
OF OUR WORLD.

301
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,666
- WHAT CAN WE DO
TO STOP THEM, WASHU?

302
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,833
GRANDFATHER?

303
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:09,333
- UNFORTUNATELY,
WE CAN DO NOTHING.

304
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:10,833
- WHY'S THAT? 
I'LL TELL YOU.

305
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,958
'CAUSE THE GEMS HAVE BEEN
SCATTERED ALL OVER THE PLACE.

306
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,958
THREE OF THEM AREN'T EVEN
HERE ON EARTH ANYMORE.

307
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,958
THEY'RE FLYING
AROUND THE COSMOS.

308
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,291
OH, HOW'D THAT HAPPEN?!
GOLLY GEE!

309
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,458
- IT'S ALL MY FAULT. I SHOULD
NEVER HAVE  COME TO TOKYO.

310
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,958
IF I JUST STAYED HOME,
EVERYTHING WOULD BE ALL RIGHT.

311
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,208
- THERE'S MORE, TENCHI.

312
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,875
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
YOU NEED TO KNOW.

313
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,791
AND IT'S NOT GOING
TO BE PLEASANT.

314
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,583
- SO YOU'VE FINALLY 
COME BACK, EH, YUGI?

315
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,583
AAH!
- ( chuckles )

316
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,041
- BE CAREFUL, PRINCESS AYEKA.

317
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,791
- I KNOW.
I'M READY FOR HER.

318
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,958
HUH?

319
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:50,958
WHAT?

320
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,958
- WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS?

321
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,583
- UH, I CAN'T TELL.

322
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:58,958
- AYEKA, WATCH OUT!

323
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,166
- ( meows )

324
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,500
- SASAMI, GET BACK INSIDE!
HURRY!

325
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,833
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

326
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,791
- WATCH OUT, PRINCESS.
- ( gasps )

327
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,125
- ( Ryo-Ohki screeches )

328
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,583
- SO YOU'RE FINALLY SHOWING
YOUR TRUE COLORS, HUH?

329
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,916
( gasps )
BUT YOU'RE NOT YUGI.

330
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,916
- MY NAME'S MATORI.

331
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,250
I'M YUGI'S SERVANT.

332
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,500
- YOU MEAN TO SAY
THAT YUGI IS YOUR BOSS?

333
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,500
- THAT'S RIGHT,
AND SHE WANTS TO SEE YOU.

334
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,583
SO, COME WITH ME,
LITTLE GIRL.

335
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,416
- SHE WANTS TO SEE ME?

336
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,791
- YES, AND YOU WANT
TO SEE HER TOO, DON'T YOU?

337
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,125
SHE'S WAITING FOR YOU.

338
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,708
COME ON,
I'LL TAKE YOU TO HER.

339
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,625
- DO YOU REALLY THINK I'D LET
YOU TAKE SASAMI AWAY FROM HERE?!

340
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,291
NOT A CHANCE!

341
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,833
- ( meows angrily )

342
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,500
- IF YOU DON'T WANNA GET HURT,

343
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,666
I SUGGEST YOU STAY
OUT OF THIS, PRINCESS.

344
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,083
THAT'S YOUR LAST WARNING.

345
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:51,416
- THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT
I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU, MATORI.

346
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,125
AZAKA, KAMIDAKE!

347
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,500
ENGAGE THE ULTIMATE
SHIELD SYSTEM NOW!

348
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:56,500
- Both:
YES, MA'AM.

349
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,791
- I KNOW IT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.
AND IF YOU WANT TO RUN AWAY NOW,

350
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:05,958
I WON'T TRY TO STOP YOU.

351
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,708
( laughs maniacally )

352
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,125
- IT IS FUNNY.

353
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,625
BUT THAT REALLY SOUNDS
MORE LIKE MY LINE.

354
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:16,000
RISE AND COME FORWARD,
ALL KAMIBITO!

355
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,000
- ( screams )
- IMPOSSIBLE!

356
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,708
- NOT LAUGHING ANYMORE, HUH?

357
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,375
WELL, I MIGHT LET YOU LIVE
IF YOU HAND OVER SASAMI.

358
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,625
- HUP. MAYBE IT
WASN'T A GOOD IDEA

359
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,375
TO TELL HIM ABOUT
THAT AFTER ALL.

360
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,375
- TENCHI...

361
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,375
- ( phone ringing )

362
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,166
- ( groaning )

363
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,625
IT'S NOT TRUE,
OR IS IT?

364
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,416
- YOU KNOW THIS GIRL,
RIGHT, TENCHI?

365
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,583
- UH-HUH.

366
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,541
- WELL, WHAT IF I TELL YOU
SHE'S NOT HUMAN?

367
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,208
- I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
NO, IT CAN'T BE!

368
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,041
WHAT KIND OF A SICK JOKE
IS THIS?!

369
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,041
YOU'RE JUST TRYING
TO DRIVE ME AWAY FROM HER.

370
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,083
ADMIT IT!

371
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,458
- TAKE A LOOK AT
THIS DISPLAY

372
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:15,916
OF HER ORGANIC ENERGY FIELD

373
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,250
SEEN THROUGH A PULSE FILTER.

374
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:20,083
YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF,
THIS IS HER TRUE FORM.

375
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,250
- AAH!

376
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,375
( panting )

377
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,625
- TENCHI...

378
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,083
I MISS YOU.

379
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,250
HUH?!

380
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,500
( gasps )

381
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,416
- YOU'VE SERVED
YOUR PURPOSE, SAKUYA.

382
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,750
NOW IT'S ALL OVER.

383
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,416
I HAVE COME TO TAKE YOU BACK
TO WHERE YOU BELONG.

384
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,125
YOU SEE, I'M FINALLY READY
TO ACTUALIZE MY GREAT DREAM.

385
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,416
- WHO-- WHO ARE YOU?

386
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,833
WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?

387
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,166
- YOU DON'T NEED TO
UNDERSTAND IT, MY PET.

388
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,583
JUST COME BACK TO ME.

389
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,750
- COME BACK?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

390
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:06,250
- SAKUYA, YOU ARE A PROJECTION
OF ME.  YOU ARE MY SHADOW.

391
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,250
- ( crying )
NO!

392
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,916
TENCHI!

393
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,750
HELP ME!

394
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,208
PLEASE!

395
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,166
( screams )

396
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,708
- SAKUYA!  OPEN THE DOOR!
IT'S ME!

397
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,291
AAH.

398
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,458
- TOO BAD, TENCHI.

399
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:32,791
YOU WEREN'T QUICK ENOUGH?

400
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,750
WHAT A SHAME, I'VE ALREADY
TAKEN MY SHADOW BACK.

401
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,250
- AAH!

402
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,291
- ( chuckles )

403
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:42,458
AHH, THE PREPARATION PHASE
IS NOW COMPLETE.

404
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,958
YES, THIS PLANET
WILL BE MINE... 

405
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,041
SOON.

406
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,375
VERY SOON.

407
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,333
( laughing )

408
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,333
- ( groaning )

409
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,333
- ( line beeping )

410
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,500
- Sakuya: Tenchi,
thank you for everything.

411
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:10,000
I had a wonderful time today.
I've come to realize that

412
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,166
even though I still can't
remember my past,

413
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,000
it doesn't matter anymore,
because I'm creating

414
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:18,166
new magical memories
every time I'm with you.

415
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,375
And I know as time goes on,

416
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,833
we'll have more and
more of them to share.

417
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:25,333
I think I was born to fall in
love with you, Tenchi.

418
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:29,541
Every day my love for you
is becoming more and more real.

419
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,541
- ( voice-breaking )
SAKUYA.  NO.

420
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,958
WHERE DID YOU GO?

421
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:47,208
- ( piano music playing )

422
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:54,125
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

423
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,708
- Sasami:
THE CITY, THE PEOPLE--

424
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:16,208
THEY'RE ALL BEING SUCKED
INTO THIS GRAY SPACE.

425
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,708
TIME HAS STOPPED.

426
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:19,458
AND IT'S ALL 'CAUSE
OF YOU, YUGI.

427
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,500
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

428
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:23,291
YOU WERE SO NICE
WHILE WE WERE TOGETHER.

429
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:25,958
WHY ARE YOU DOING SUCH
HORRIBLE THINGS NOW?

430
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,958
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST BE FRIENDS
WITH EVERYONE?

431
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,875
PLEASE, YUGI,
LISTEN TO ME.

432
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:32,250
PLEASE.

433
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:36,166
THE NEXT EPISODE OF
THE NEW TENCHI MUYO SERIES...
