1
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,791
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,250
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,750
- ISN'T IT AMAZING? DID YOU
CHECK OUT THE HORS D'OEUVRES?

4
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:09,875
- WE'RE SURE WORKING A LOT.
- I WANT SOME HORS D'OEUVRES.

5
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:12,541
- IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO
ON THIS VERY DAY

6
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:16,250
OUR DELIGHTFUL DESTINY AND FATE
LED US HERE TO MEET LORD TENCHI.

7
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:19,875
YES, HE SHOWED GREAT GENEROSITY
BY TAKING ALL OF US STRANGERS

8
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,416
FROM OUTER SPACE HERE
INTO HIS OWN HOME.

9
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,708
TO SHOW OUR GRATITUDE,
WE DECIDED TO MAKE A HOLIDAY.

10
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,750
IT'S TENCHI ANNIVERSARY DAY.

11
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,583
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HAVING
THIS PARTY.

12
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:32,416
SO COME ON, EVERYONE.
LET'S CELEBRATE.

13
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,875
- ( laughs )
- GRAB A GLASS, EVERYBODY.

14
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:38,041
I WANT TO START THIS
WITH A VERY SPECIAL TOAST.

15
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,458
TO TENCHI,
WE LOVE YOU, TENCHI.

16
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:44,375
- RYOKO!
- ( gasping )

17
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:47,083
- ( laughs )
SORRY, TENCHI.

18
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,500
- ( laughs ) THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

19
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:03,041
- THIS IS IT.
TENCHI LIVES RIGHT NEAR HERE.

20
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,291
TENCHI.

21
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,083
( inaudible )

22
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:12,500
- I LOVE TENCHI.
I'LL ALWAYS LOVE HIM.

23
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,375
THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO
SEE HIM NOW.

24
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,833
I'LL FIND HIM
AND I'LL TELL HIM HOW I FEEL.

25
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,958
I JUST HAVE TO TELL HIM
ONE MORE TIME.

26
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,791
- I FEEL KIND OF SORRY
FOR HER.

27
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,791
I THINK I'LL GIVE HER
A LITTLE HELP.

28
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:46,916
- ( cackles )

29
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,708
- ( men and women laughing )

30
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,041
- COME ON, TENCHI.
OPEN YOUR MOUTH.

31
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:56,083
- I CAN FEED MYSELF, RYOKO.
- TENCHI, HERE.

32
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:59,208
I THINK YOU'LL FIND THESE
CUCUMBER ROLLS MUCH MORE SAVORY.

33
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:02,625
- MY SNACKS ARE MUCH BETTER,
TENCHI.  GO ON, TRY IT.

34
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,666
- SASAMI'S THE ONE WHO COOKED
ALL THIS FOOD.

35
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,125
NOW COME ON, YOU TWO.
GIMME A BREAK, WOULD YOU?!

36
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,041
- MMM!
- IT'S TRUE, SASAMI.

37
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,958
EVERYTHING YOU COOK IS REALLY
DELICIOUS,

38
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,166
BUT TODAY IT'S TASTIER
THAN EVER.

39
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,250
- THANKS, KIYONE.
I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT.

40
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,041
I USED SOME SUPER FANCY COOKING
TRICKS TO MAKE IT SPECIAL

41
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,625
FOR TENCHI DAY.
- ( meows )

42
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,500
- EAT IT, TENCHI.  YOU CAN TAKE
IT RIGHT OUT OF MY MOUTH.

43
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,166
- IT'S REALLY NICE OF EVERYONE
TO THROW THIS PARTY FOR ME,

44
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,791
BUT I REALLY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
TO DESERVE IT.

45
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,666
- HMM.
- HMM.

46
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,583
- IT WAS MY MOTHER'S NECKLACE
THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING.

47
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:40,833
- HE'S RIGHT, YOU KNOW?  IF IT
WEREN'T FOR THOSE SPECIAL GEMS,

48
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,125
WE'D NEVER HAVE MET TENCHI
OR ANYTHING.

49
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,666
WE WOULDN'T KNOW EACH OTHER,
AND WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING

50
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,166
THIS PARTY TODAY.

51
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,333
- THAT'S TRUE, KIYONE.

52
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:52,708
- REMEMBER HOW BEATEN UP
WE WERE AFTER THE BATTLE?

53
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,083
- ARE YOU OKAY, AYEKA?

54
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,291
- ( snoring )

55
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:10,416
- ( groaning )

56
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,208
- IS SHE GOING TO BE
ALL RIGHT, WASHU?

57
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:15,250
- SHE'S VERY STRONG.
MUCH STRONGER THAN EARTHLINGS.

58
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:18,000
BUT SHE'S GRAVELY WOUNDED.

59
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,666
- OH, I SEE.  WELL...

60
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:26,375
- THANK YOU, TENCHI,
FOR COMING AND SAVING EVERYONE.

61
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:29,041
- IT WASN'T ME, REALLY.

62
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,541
- THE NECKLACE YOU'RE WEARING.

63
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,916
BE SURE THAT YOU
NEVER LOSE IT.

64
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,583
- HUH?

65
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,166
- IN TIME, I WANT
TO EXAMINE THOSE GEMS

66
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,875
AND LEARN ABOUT THEM.

67
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,541
I WANT TO UNDERSTAND
THEIR POWER AND YOURS.

68
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,333
- MISS WASHU.

69
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,750
WHO COULD HAVE IMAGINED
THERE WAS SUCH HORRIBLE POWER

70
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,333
IN THE NECKLACE
MY MOTHER LEFT ME?

71
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,416
- TENCHI.

72
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,791
- GRANDPA.  ( shouts )

73
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,666
TELL ME.
WHAT'S IN THESE GEMS?

74
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,541
- TENCHI, RIGHT NOW YOU MUST
THINK ABOUT THE GIRLS

75
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,333
WHO'VE COME HERE FROM SPACE.

76
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,750
FOCUS YOUR THOUGHTS
ON HEALING THEM.

77
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:25,000
AND BE AWARE THAT THERE WILL
COME A DAY, TENCHI,

78
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:28,458
A DAY WHEN YOU MUST LEARN
THE POWER OF THESE GEMS.

79
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:31,041
YOU'LL NEED THEM.

80
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,791
- GRANDPA.

81
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,541
- ( water sloshing )

82
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,875
- ( exhales ) HERE.

83
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,958
OW!

84
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:43,500
- ( gasps ) WOW!

85
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:47,291
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

86
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:50,041
IT'S JUST AS BEAUTIFUL HERE
AS ON PLANET JURAI.

87
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,708
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT REALLY IS JUST AS LOVELY.

88
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,625
ALMOST.
IT IS OUR HOME PLANET.

89
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,375
- HEY, WHEN ARE WE GOING
BACK THERE, AYEKA?

90
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,208
YOU ARE THE PRINCESS
AND NOW THAT YOU'RE BETTER--

91
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:02,708
WELL, WHAT IS IT?

92
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,541
- I WANT TO STAY HERE.
- HUH?

93
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,375
AYEKA.

94
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,250
( gasps ) IT'S YOU, TENCHI.

95
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,333
- MISS AYEKA.
- LORD TENCHI.

96
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,375
THANKS TO YOU,
I'M COMPLETELY RECOVERED.

97
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,500
I'M ALL BETTER.
THANK YOU.

98
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,583
- MISS AYEKA,
YOU DON'T NEED TO BOW.

99
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:25,791
- HUH?

100
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,166
- UH, MISS AYEKA.

101
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,958
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE DINNER
WITH US?

102
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,333
I COOKED IT TODAY.
I MEAN, I TRIED.

103
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,375
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S EDIBLE.
I'M NOT A REAL GREAT COOK,

104
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,875
BUT YOU'RE INVITED
IF YOU WANNA COME.

105
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:37,875
- I DO.

106
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:41,250
- AYEKA AND TENCHI.

107
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,291
AWW, THEY MAKE SUCH
A PERFECT COUPLE.

108
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,458
- I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT, MIHOSHI.
SHE'S A LUCKY GIRL.

109
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,041
- MM-HMM.

110
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,416
- ( snoring )

111
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,291
- Washu:
TENCHI, IS THAT YOU?

112
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:08,125
- HOW IS SHE DOING,
MISS WASHU?

113
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,500
- SHE HASN'T RECOVERED
CONSCIOUSNESS YET.

114
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,750
YOU KNOW, SHE DID GET HURT
AND RATHER BADLY.

115
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,875
- Man:
TENCHI, YOU HAVE A VISITOR.

116
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,791
- Tenchi:
SAKUYA.

117
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:28,291
- I KNEW IT, TENCHI.  SHE WAS
WANDERING AROUND THE BUS STOP,

118
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,458
TOTALLY LOST,
SO I OFFERED TO HELP,

119
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,625
AND SHE TOLD ME SHE
WAS YOUR CLASSMATE.

120
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,041
- HI, TENCHI.
THE REASON I CAME,

121
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,125
I WANTED TO TELL YOU
THAT I FEEL VERY--

122
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,458
- TENCHI, WE'RE RUNNING OUT
OF FOOD.

123
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,541
AYEKA, ATE IT ALL AND--
- ( screaming )

124
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,625
- YOU!  I THOUGHT WE GOT
AWAY FROM YOU.

125
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,291
WHAT IN THE WORLD
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

126
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:49,708
- YOU'RE THOSE MONSTER BUSTERS,
BUT WHY ARE YOU HERE?

127
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:53,500
- THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE.
- YOU LIVE HERE IN THIS HOUSE?

128
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,000
IN TENCHI'S HOUSE?

129
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,375
- COME IN.

130
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,375
- ARE YOU HAVING SOME KIND
OF PARTY HERE?

131
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:04,041
- YES, WE ARE.
IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PARTY

132
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,750
THAT WE CELEBRATE WITH TENCHI.
IT'S OFF-LIMITS

133
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,833
TO SCHEMING LITTLE
GATE CRASHERS.

134
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,458
- NOW HOLD ON, RYOKO.
THINK ABOUT IT.

135
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,083
IF SHE LEAVES NOW, SHE WON'T
UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION.

136
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,833
I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE OUR
LITTLE FRIEND HERE UNDERSTAND

137
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,333
ALL ABOUT THIS SPECIAL DAY

138
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,833
AND OUR SPECIAL
RELATIONSHIP WITH TENCHI.

139
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,208
- HOW'S THAT?

140
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,791
- IT WAS ON THIS DAY
TWO YEARS AGO

141
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,833
WE MET LORD TENCHI
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

142
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:29,208
IT WAS A SPECIAL DESTINY
OF THE HEART.

143
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,333
AND HE GAVE THESE
VERY RARE GEMS TO US ALL.

144
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:35,250
IT'S GONE.  MY GEM IS GONE!

145
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,625
- YOU MUST HAVE EATEN IT WITH
YOUR CUCUMBER ROLLS

146
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:38,791
OR SOMETHING.
GEE, WHAT A SHAME.

147
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,416
I'LL JUST SHOW HER MINE INSTEAD.

148
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,250
WHAT?  ( screaming )

149
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,250
IT'S GONE!

150
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,750
- GONE?
- ( clamoring )

151
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,750
- MINE'S GONE, TOO!

152
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,000
IT WAS A GIFT FROM MY MOTHER
AND NOW IT'S GONE.

153
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,000
HOW COULD IT HAVE
HAPPENED?

154
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,916
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY'RE IRREPLACEABLE!

155
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,333
- ( cackles )

156
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,583
- ( meows )

157
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,208
- ( meows )

158
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,791
- TENCHI'S NECKLACE!
- HIS MOTHER'S HEIRLOOM!

159
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,250
- THE GEMS ARE--
- GONE!

160
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:22,416
- IT WAS YOUR MOTHER'S HEIRLOOM?
- IT'S HER, TENCHI.

161
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,875
- HUH?

162
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,083
- SHE'S THE THIEF.
SHE DID IT!

163
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,291
- HUH?

164
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,875
- JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

165
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,750
THE GEMS WERE HERE
AND THEN POOF.

166
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,416
THEY WERE GONE.  ALL JUST
MOMENTS AFTER SHE GOT HERE.

167
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,000
WHO ELSE COULD
HAVE STOLEN THEM?  SHE DID IT.

168
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,291
- ME, BUT I--

169
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,750
- RYOKO!
- Ayeka: I MUST AGREE.

170
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,958
RYOKO HAS AN EXCELLENT POINT.
SHE MAY WELL BE RIGHT.

171
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,958
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

172
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,250
- HMM?

173
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,791
- Tenchi: OH!

174
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,333
- I'M NOT.  I DIDN'T.

175
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,041
- LITTLE MISS INNOCENT.

176
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:58,291
THERE'S ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.
HERE!

177
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:01,583
- HMM.
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING HERE.

178
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,500
- HUH?

179
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,291
THEN SHE MUST BE HIDING
THEM SOMEWHERE.

180
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,708
COME ON, WHERE ARE THEY?

181
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,250
HEY, I ASKED YOU A QUESTION.

182
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,208
- I, I DIDN'T STEAL THEM.

183
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,583
- THAT'S A LIE.

184
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,791
- HOW COULD I?
I JUST GOT HERE.

185
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,416
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
ABOUT THESE GEMS.

186
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,541
- WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

187
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:26,541
- ( screams )

188
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,500
- I NEVER LIKED YOU ANYWAY.

189
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,958
YOU'RE A SNEAK TRYING
TO STEAL TENCHI.

190
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,500
NOW WHAT DID YOU DO
WITH THOSE GEMS?

191
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:33,958
I KNOW YOU TOOK THEM.

192
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,833
- OW!

193
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,125
- HAND THEM OVER RIGHT NOW
OR ELSE!

194
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:45,333
- ( gasps ) MY HEAVENS.

195
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,666
- THE NEXT ONE'S GOING TO BE
FOR YOU

196
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,250
UNLESS YOU START TALKING,
YOU LITTLE THIEF.

197
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,416
- OH!
- TAKE THIS!

198
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,708
- STOP IT!

199
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:56,375
- LORD TENCHI!

200
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,333
- TENCHI.

201
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,208
- STOP THIS, RYOKO.

202
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,291
- GET OUT OF MY WAY.

203
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:08,666
I KNOW SHE STOLE THEM.

204
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,916
- SAKUYA WOULD NEVER
STEAL ANYTHING.

205
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,541
- ( whimpers )

206
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:23,958
OH, IS THAT RIGHT?  WHY ARE
YOU TRYING TO PROTECT HER?

207
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:27,166
GO TO HELL, TENCHI.
YOU FOOL!

208
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,416
- RYOKO!

209
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:35,625
- HOW COULD HE TAKE HER SIDE?
HOW COULD HE?

210
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,375
- RYOKO.

211
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:53,333
- HE STOOD UP FOR ME.
TENCHI.

212
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,041
- ALL RIGHT THEN,
WHO DID STEAL THOSE GEMS?

213
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:59,250
- Washu: I CAN ANSWER THAT EASY.
- MISS WASHU!

214
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,041
- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
AND WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO

215
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,041
ALL THIS TIME, WASHU?
- ( laughs )

216
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:06,250
TAKE A GUESS.
I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS.

217
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,625
- OH, WOW, WHAT IS IT?

218
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,333
- IT'S A GEM DETECTOR.
INVENTED BY A REAL GENIUS,

219
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,333
ME OF COURSE,
WASHU THE GREAT.

220
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:17,833
THIS BOX CAN DETECT A SPECIAL
ENERGY GENERATED BY THOSE GEMS.

221
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,666
LET'S TRY IT.

222
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,416
THE THIEF IS RIGHT
IN THIS ROOM.

223
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,083
- ( all gasp )

224
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,791
- THE THIEF IS...

225
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,916
THERE.
- ( screeching )

226
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,208
- ( laughs )

227
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,500
- ( all ) HUH?

228
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,458
- HE'S GOT THE GEMS.

229
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,125
- IT'S HIM.
- THAT LITTLE CREATURE.

230
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:50,833
WE SAW HIM HERE BEFORE.
- WHY, HE'S A ROBBER!

231
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:54,333
- ( screeching )

232
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,541
- HE'S GONNA HURT US.

233
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:59,750
- NO WAY. ( shouting )

234
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:09,583
EVERYONE, THOSE GEMS
ARE THE PROOF OF THE BOND

235
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:13,333
BETWEEN US AND TENCHI.  WE MUST
GET THEM BACK AT ALL COSTS.

236
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:14,666
- ( all ) YEAH!

237
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,541
- THE PROOF OF THE BOND?

238
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,375
OH, TENCHI.

239
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,541
- TENCHI.

240
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:35,208
THAT TIME LONG AGO, I COULDN'T
FORGIVE YOU THEN, EITHER.

241
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,708
OR RATHER, I WAS FRUSTRATED.

242
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,333
FRUSTRATED THAT I, RYOKO,

243
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,666
THE GREATEST SPACE PIRATE
OF ALL

244
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,541
SHOULD BE BEATEN IN BATTLE
BY A COUNTRY KID LIKE YOU.

245
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,583
I SWORE I WOULD DEFEAT YOU

246
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,083
AS SOON AS I RECOVERED
FROM MY INJURY.

247
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:56,750
BUT, TENCHI,
YOU WERE SO KIND TO ME.

248
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:07,416
- DAY BY DAY, YOU TOOK SUCH
TENDER CARE OF ME

249
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,708
EVEN THOUGH YOU YOURSELF
WERE WORN OUT.

250
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:13,166
NO ONE HAD EVER TREATED ME
LIKE THAT.

251
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:15,916
- ( sighs )

252
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,625
- ( door opens )
- ( gasps )

253
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:33,375
- I KNOW THAT YOU STILL
CAN'T HEAR ME,

254
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,541
BUT WASHU THINKS THAT
YOU'LL RECOVER SOON.

255
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,708
I HOPE SHE'S RIGHT, RYOKO.

256
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,041
BECAUSE WHEN YOU WAKE UP,

257
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,916
I WANNA SHOW YOU
AROUND THE EARTH.

258
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,458
- YOUR VOICE WAS SO KIND.

259
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,833
YOU TOLD ME STORIES
ABOUT AMUSEMENT PARKS

260
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:50,916
AND HOT SPRINGS AND ALL THE FUN
PLACES TO SEE ON PLANET EARTH.

261
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,541
YOU TOLD ME ABOUT THE DELICIOUS
FOOD WE WOULD EAT TOGETHER

262
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,541
AND SO MANY OTHER GOOD THINGS.

263
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,291
AND WHEN YOU FINISHED YOUR
STORIES, YOU WOULD LEAVE.

264
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,875
EXCEPT FOR THAT ONE NIGHT
WHEN THE MOON WAS FULL

265
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,583
AND YOU STAYED BY MY BEDSIDE
ALL NIGHT LONG.

266
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,791
I DON'T KNOW WHO THIS HAPPENED,
RYOKO.

267
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,250
I KNOW I COULD NEVER
MAKE IT UP TO YOU

268
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:16,666
I'M SO SORRY. I DIDN'T WANT
TO HURT YOU.  BELIEVE ME.

269
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,958
YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO WANT
REVENGE.

270
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,125
I WISH I COULD
MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

271
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:24,041
I SWEAR.

272
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:29,791
RYOKO, PLEASE.
OPEN YOUR EYES.

273
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,000
- EW.

274
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,041
- TENCHI.

275
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,541
- RYOKO!

276
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,500
- TENCHI, WHAT?

277
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:49,458
- THAT'S HIM UP THERE.  HE'S
THE ONE WHO STOLE THOSE GEMS.

278
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,666
- HUH?

279
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,166
- ( shouting )

280
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,125
- I SEE.  SO YOU'RE THE ONE,
YOU LITTLE WEASEL.

281
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,708
WHAT YOU'VE STOLEN IS MY BOND
WITH TENCHI.

282
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,833
I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU!

283
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,583
I'M GONNA BLOW YOU UP.
- ( screams )

284
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,500
- RYOKO.
OH, THANK GOODNESS.

285
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,166
I WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
YOU FINALLY WOKE UP.

286
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,208
- WHAT'S WITH THIS SORRY FACE
OF YOURS?

287
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,500
IS THAT THE FACE OF THE MAN
WHO DARED TO BLAST RYOKO,

288
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,041
THE GREATEST SPACE PIRATE
IN THE UNIVERSE?

289
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,708
- WELL, NOW HOLD ON.

290
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:38,500
- JUST TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T
BLAST ME AGAIN, TENCHI,

291
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,875
I'M GOING TO KEEP THIS
LITTLE GEM.

292
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,083
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
GIVE IT HERE.

293
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:45,083
- BY THE WAY, MY FRIEND,
I'VE DECIDED TO USE YOUR PLACE

294
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,875
AS MY NEW HIDEOUT.

295
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:50,583
- NO, YOU'RE KIDDING.
- UNH-UNH.

296
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,583
YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME.

297
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,875
- ( clears throat )
- HUH?

298
00:18:56,958 --> 00:19:00,291
WHAT ARE YOU ALL DOING HERE?

299
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,583
- AND HOW DID YOU GET
ALL THE GEMS BACK?

300
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,041
- IF YOU'RE GOING TO STAY HERE,
RYOKO,

301
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,375
THEN I'LL JUST HAVE TO
STAY HERE AS WELL.

302
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,541
IT'S PART OF MY DUTY
AS A PRINCESS AND GUARDIAN.

303
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:12,041
WHY DON'T YOU JUST ADMIT YOU
WANT TO LIVE HERE WITH TENCHI?

304
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,416
- MM-HMM.
- ( laughing )

305
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,458
- IT IS TRUE THAT KEEPING AN EYE
ON A SPACE PIRATE LIKE RYOKO

306
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,375
IS AN IMPORTANT DUTY 
FOR THE POLICE FORCE.

307
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,625
- YOU'RE WORSE THAT AYEKA.
YOU JUST WANT TO STAY HERE,

308
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,541
AND YOU KNOW IT.
- ( growls )

309
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,625
- THIS PLANET IS RATHER
COMFORTABLE TO LIVE ON.

310
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:32,375
I WANT TO STUDY THE POWER
OF THESE GEMSTONES FURTHER.

311
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,666
SO I THINK THAT
I'LL STAY HERE AS WELL.

312
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,541
- I DON'T WANT ANY OF YOU
AROUND HERE.

313
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,291
GO BACK TO WHATEVER PLANET
YOU CAME FROM.

314
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,833
YOU'RE ALL A BUNCH OF SNOOPS.

315
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:43,583
- SNOOPS? I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW
THAT I'M THE FIRST PRINCESS

316
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:47,250
OF THE JURAI ROYAL FAMILY AND NO
ONE HAS EVER CALLED ME A SNOOP.

317
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,916
SO DON'T DO IT AGAIN.
- YEAH?

318
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,083
SNOOP, SNOOP, SNOOP,
SNOOPY SNOOP.

319
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,958
I'LL CALL YOU ANYTHING I WANT,
MISS PRISSY PRINCESS.

320
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,416
- ( growls )

321
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,416
- HEY, CUT IT OUT,
BOTH OF YOU.

322
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,000
YOU CAN LIVE HERE TOGETHER
AS FRIENDS.  WE ALL CAN, RIGHT?

323
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,958
- YOU REALLY MEAN IT?

324
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,291
- Tenchi:
HUH?  WELL, YEAH.

325
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,333
- ALL RIGHT!
- ( cheering )

326
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,458
- Tenchi: WHAT AM I GETTING
MYSELF INTO?

327
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,333
- NOW LET'S GET ON
WITH OUR TENCHI DAY PARTY.

328
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,833
COME ON, EVERYBODY.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

329
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,625
- TENCHI.  UH--

330
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:37,000
- ( laughing )
- ( chattering )

331
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:54,083
- THERE'S NO PLACE FOR ME.
NOT HERE.

332
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,625
- Katsuhito: MISS.
- ( gasps )

333
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:59,125
- IT'S NOT SAFE
TO WALK ALONE AT NIGHT.

334
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,791
DID YOU FIND
WHAT YOU CAME FOR?

335
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,833
- NO, ACTUALLY,
I WAS SURPRISED.

336
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:07,750
I SURPRISED MYSELF BY COMING
ALL THE WAY HERE TO SEE TENCHI.

337
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,875
BUT NOW I SEE THAT
I DON'T BELONG.

338
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,583
- DON'T LEAVE NOW.
STAY HERE WITH US TONIGHT.

339
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:16,000
WE'LL FIND YOU A COMFORTABLE
PLACE TO SLEEP.

340
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:19,041
TOMORROW YOU CAN GO BACK
TO TOKYO WITH TENCHI.

341
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,791
YOU MAY SEE THINGS
DIFFERENTLY BY THEN.

342
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,791
- SO THEY ALL STICK TOGETHER.
I DON'T SEE HOW,

343
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,916
BUT IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE.

344
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,166
WELL, ANYWAY,
AT LEAST NOW I KNOW.

345
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,208
( laughing )

346
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,125
- ( theme music playing )

347
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,541
- ( singing in Japanese )

348
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,083
- ( meows )

349
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:11,625
- HI, I'M KIYONE.

350
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:14,125
I FINALLY DID IT, MIHOSHI.

351
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:16,208
I FOUND A PERFECT PART-TIME JOB
FOR US.

352
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:18,625
WE'RE GOING TO WORK
ON A NEW EXCAVATION SITE

353
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:20,625
OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE--
HUH?

354
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:24,250
OH, NO, ISN'T THAT AYEKA?
WHAT?

355
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:25,625
SHE'S COME TO FIND TENCHI.

356
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:27,708
I'VE GOT A FEELING SOMETHING BAD
IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

357
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:30,625
HEY, THAT'S NOT AZAKA
AND KAMIDAKE.

358
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:34,583
LOOKS LIKE I WAS RIGHT
ABOUT SOMETHING BAD HAPPENING.

359
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:37,416
THE NEXT EPISODE OF THE NEW
TENCHI MUYO SERIES--


360
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,666
"THE GUARDIANS OF OLD."
