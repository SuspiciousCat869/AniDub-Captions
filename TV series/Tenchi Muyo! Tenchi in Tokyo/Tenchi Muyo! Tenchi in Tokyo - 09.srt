1
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,750
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:47,166
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:06,041
- ( horn blows )

4
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,583
- ( laughing )
- Woman: I'M GETTING OFF HERE

5
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:20,041
AND THAT'LL BE THE LAST TIME
I SEE YOU.

6
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:31,041
- ( P.A. announcer
speaks in Japanese )

7
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,791
- IT'S GOODBYE.

8
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:38,125
- WAIT.  TAKE THIS.

9
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,083
- OH!

10
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,708
- I WANT YOU TO MARRY ME.

11
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:54,083
- ( gasps )

12
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,083
- ( sobs )

13
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,750
- Man on TV: That concludes
the "Juyo Line of Love."

14
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:10,125
- THAT PROGRAM IS SO SAPPY
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

15
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,375
- THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT
SO WONDERFUL. ( sniffles )

16
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,916
IT'S SO HEART-WRENCHING.

17
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,416
- I'M GLAD IT HAD
A HAPPY ENDING.  AREN'T YOU?

18
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,583
- YES, IT'S BEAUTIFUL
TO BE CLOSE TO THE ONE YOU LOVE.

19
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:28,125
- Sasami: OKAY, THAT'S ABOUT
ENOUGH TELEVISION.

20
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,625
LET'S TURN IT OFF.

21
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,125
- NO WAY, SASAMI.  "THE WHITE
SNOWFALL" IS STARTING NOW.

22
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:35,666
IT'S MY FAVORITE SOAP.
ALL THE CHARACTERS HAVE AMNESIA.

23
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,875
- GREAT.  ARE THEY ALL
OBSESSED LIKE YOU?

24
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:41,041
AYEKA, YOU'VE GOTTA TURN THAT
OFF.  IT'S A TOTAL YAWN

25
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,708
AND MIHOSHI ASKED ME
TO TAPE A RERUN

26
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,458
OF "SPACE POLICE POLICEMAN"
FOR HER.

27
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,166
- "SPACE POLICE POLICEMAN,"
YOU'RE JOKING.

28
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,875
- UNH-UNH.  IN TOKYO,
SHE TOOK A PART-TIME JOB

29
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,625
PLAYING A SPACE VILLAIN
IN THIS WEIRD "POLICEMAN" SHOW.

30
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,583
- THAT'S HER PROBLEM.  I'M NOT
GOING TO MISS "WHITE SNOWFALL."

31
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,625
- Ryoko: OH, NO.
I ALMOST FORGOT.

32
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:01,958
IT'S TIME FOR "WILD SAMURAI'S
LONE JOURNEY 5."

33
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,625
- ( gasps ) HEY, WHAT DO
YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

34
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,583
- IS THERE A PROBLEM?
- YES, YOU.

35
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,791
I'M NOT GOING TO WATCH
SOME DERANGED SAMURAI SHOW.

36
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,875
IT IS TIME FOR MY SOAP.
NOW DON'T GRAB MY REMOTE.

37
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,291
IT'S BAD MANNERS.
- ( both grunting )

38
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,041
- DON'T YOU EVER GET ENOUGH
OF THOSE WHINY SOAPS, HUH?

39
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,666
THEY'RE NAUSEATING.
- YOU AND YOUR SAMURAI SHOWS

40
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,083
ARE GREAT DRAMA, RIGHT?
PERFECT FOR A TOTAL PSYCHO.

41
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,291
- ( meows )

42
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,541
- WHAT?  YOU WANNA PLAY
A VIDEO GAME?

43
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:31,750
- DON'T INTERRUPT OUR FIGHT.

44
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:32,875
- HERE WE GO.

45
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,666
- SO GINGERBREAD'S MADE
FROM GINGER?

46
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,083
- THAT'S RIGHT, AND GINGER'S
IN ONE OF THE FIVE FOOD GROUPS.

47
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,958
- WASHU, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
PUT IT BACK

48
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,500
ON "WILD SAMURAI
LONE JOURNEY 5."

49
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,500
- AND MISS THIS?  NO WAY.

50
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,041
"SCIENCE FOR EGGHEADS" IS
MY FAVORITE SHOW.  IT ROCKS.

51
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,583
- IF IT WERE UP TO ME,

52
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,583
I'D WATCH "MR. HOME EC'S
THREE-MINUTE COOKING CORNER."

53
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:51,750
HOW ABOUT YOU, AZAKA?

54
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,583
- SAMURAIS DON'T WATCH
TELEVISION.

55
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,208
- HEY, I'M GOING TO MISS
MY FAVORITE SHOW.

56
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,083
- WASHU, PUT ON THE "SAMURAI."

57
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:01,666
- CALM DOWN, EVERYONE.
I HAVE A NEW INVENTION

58
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,750
THAT WILL SOLVE THE SITUATION.
IT'S PURE GENIUS, OF COURSE.

59
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,291
MULTIPLE TELEVISION.

60
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,833
- GET OUT.  THAT THING
IS SO PUNY,

61
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,416
YOU'D NEED TO BE AN ANT
TO WATCH IT.

62
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,958
- THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.
TAKE A LOOK.

63
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,333
- ( gasping )

64
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,708
- YOU SEE?
NEVER DOUBT MY BRAINPOWER.

65
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,541
AND THERE'S MORE.

66
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,041
I PLANTED DNA FROM
SOME MULTIPLYING MITOCHONDRIA

67
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,208
IN THE TV'S HARD DRIVE.
NOW YOU CAN ALL WATCH WHATEVER

68
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,916
PROGRAM YOU LIKE AND QUIT
BUGGING ME ALL THE TIME.

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,708
- YOU INVENTED SOMETHING USEFUL.
WHAT A CONCEPT.

70
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,791
- YOU REALLY ARE A GENIUS,
WASHU.

71
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,166
- THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN
TELLING YOU.

72
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,916
ONLY YOU CAN MAKE THAT
SUPER GENIUS.  ( laughing )

73
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,583
- UH, EXCUSE ME.

74
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:56,375
DON'T YOU THINK THERE'S
A LITTLE TOO MANY OF THEM?

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,958
- ( gasping )

76
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,416
- WHOOPS!

77
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,875
- ( explosion )

78
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,791
- UGH.  HUH?

79
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:16,041
- THANK YOU, AZAKA AND KAMIDAKE.
- OUR PLEASURE.

80
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,666
IT'S OUR DUTY AS GUARDIANS

81
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,666
TO PROTECT YOU
FROM ALL HARM, PRINCESS.

82
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,083
- WE WILL GO ANYWHERE ANYTIME
TO PROTECT YOU FROM DANGER.

83
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,541
- THAT'S HEARTWARMING.

84
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,833
MEANWHILE, I'M MISSING
"WILD SAMURAI LONE JOURNEY 5."

85
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:31,583
- HUH?
- LOOK THERE ON TV.

86
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,458
- HUH?
- ( fanfare plays )

87
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:34,666
- LORD TENCHI!
- TENCHI!

88
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,291
- Good afternoon, everyone.
I'm bringing you

89
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,875
this action news report live
from a suburb of Tokyo.

90
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,625
- DUMB REPORTER.
MOVE SO I CAN SEE TENCHI.

91
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,958
- This North Okutama ruin
was discovered near the fissure

92
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,583
created by an earthquake
three months ago.

93
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,125
According to researchers here,
this ruin is believed

94
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,375
to be 3,500 years old.

95
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,791
The primary excavation
was just completed yesterday.

96
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:59,250
- AHA!  SO TENCHI'S
IN NORTH OKUTAMA NOW.

97
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,958
I'LL JUST HAVE TO
GO VISIT HIM ALONE.

98
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,458
- AZAKA!
 - ON MY WAY.

99
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:07,166
- ( Ryoko screams )
- ( Azaka grunts )

100
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,208
- ( laughing )

101
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,208
- ( gasps )

102
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,541
YOU SNEAKY WITCH!

103
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:17,000
- HOORAY!  I GOT RYOKO STUCK
ON HER SIDE OF THE TUNNEL.

104
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:20,583
THAT MEANS I CAN HAVE A PRIVATE
RENDEZVOUS WITH LORD TENCHI.

105
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:24,250
- ( laughs )
- HEY, COME BACK HERE, AYEKA!

106
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,500
- STUDENTS, BEHAVE YOURSELVES
AND STAY TOGETHER...

107
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:35,041
- HE TREATS US ALL LIKE
WE'RE STILL IN GRADE SCHOOL

108
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,958
OR DIDN'T YOU NOTICE?
- YEAH.

109
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:40,625
- Girl: WHAT'S WRONG, SAKUYA?
YOU SEEM SO QUIET LATELY.

110
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,625
EVER SINCE YOU TOOK THAT DAY
OFF, YOU'VE BEEN ACTING STRANGE.

111
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,291
WHAT HAPPENED?
- BET I KNOW.

112
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,291
YOU ATE TOO MUCH AND YOU
PUT ON SOME WEIGHT, RIGHT?

113
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:50,625
- THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, NOT HERS.
- HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

114
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,583
- LISTEN, SAKUYA.
MAYBE WE CAN HELP.

115
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,791
IF SOMETHING HAPPENED,
TELL US WHAT IT IS.

116
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:55,833
- WELL...

117
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:04,083
IT'S NOTHING REALLY.
NOTHING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT.

118
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,208
SO LET'S GO.

119
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,208
- HEY, TENCHI, TENCHI.
- HUH?

120
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,458
- COME ON, BUDDY,
WE GOTTA HURRY.

121
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,375
THE REST OF THE CLASS
HAS GONE AHEAD OF US.

122
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,583
- BUT MAYBE WE CAN FIND
A TREASURE HERE,

123
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,041
LIKE SOME OLD KING'S SCEPTER
COVERED IN JEWELS.

124
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:19,125
OR MAYBE WE COULD DIG UP
SOME GOLDEN POTTERY.

125
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,041
- IF SOMETHING'S MADE OUT OF
GOLD, THEN IT'S NOT POTTERY.

126
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,875
ANYWAY, THERE'S NO TREASURES
AROUND HERE.

127
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,000
JUST A BUNCH OF OLD JUNK.
HUH?

128
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,666
OF COURSE, IT'S STILL
INTERESTING, EH, TENCHI?

129
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,583
- HUH?  WELL, IT DOES MAKE YOU
WONDER, DOESN'T IT?

130
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:34,750
WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE COULD HAVE
LIVED HERE 3,500 YEARS AGO?

131
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,458
- ACTUALLY, I KNOW A LOT
ABOUT THAT.

132
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:40,583
3,500 WOULD BE
THE AZUCHI-MOMOYAMA PERIOD.

133
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:44,000
- IT'S IN THE JOMON ERA.
FOR SURE.

134
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,958
- HA!
THOUGHT YOU WERE SO SMART!

135
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:50,333
WHO'S THE CLOWN NOW?
- CAN'T YOU SEE I SAID THAT

136
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,083
ON PURPOSE JUST
TO MAKE YOU LAUGH?

137
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:55,041
- YOU'RE GONNA BREAK THIS THING!
- ( screaming )

138
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,416
- UGH!  BETTER WATCH OUT
FOR THAT LAST STEP.

139
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,125
- WOW.  WHERE ARE WE?

140
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:20,375
AM I STILL UMANOSUKE?
UH-HUH.

141
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:24,291
- HUH?  THAT PLACE.
WHAT IS IT?

142
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:32,166
- ( laughing )

143
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,625
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE JUST
INVADED YOUR BEDROOM.

144
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,000
DID YOU KNOW THAT, YUKI?

145
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,625
- THIS IS NOT MY BEDROOM
AT ALL.

146
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,666
IN FACT, IT'S MY GRAVE
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW.

147
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:49,541
- Tenchi: COULD THIS REALLY BE
FROM THE JOMON ERA?

148
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,291
- YEAH, WE JUST MADE
A HISTORIC DISCOVERY.

149
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:55,500
I HEREBY DECLARE THIS
THE AMAGASAKI SHRINE,

150
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,208
AFTER MYSELF OF COURSE,
WHICH MEANS THAT NOW I'M FAMOUS.

151
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,833
- HOW ARE YOU GONNA GET FAMOUS
IF YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF HERE?

152
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,166
WE ARE UNDER THE GROUND.

153
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,791
WHAT IF WE'RE ALL
STUCK HERE FOREVER?

154
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,291
WHAT IF WE HAVE TO LIVE HERE
TILL WE'RE OLD WITH BEARDS

155
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,208
AND EVERYTHING?

156
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,291
- WELL, THERE YOU GO.  ANOTHER
DAY JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHERS.

157
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,750
EH, TENCHI?

158
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,416
- WHAT'S THAT, UMANOSUKE?
DID YOU SAY SOMETHING THERE?

159
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,666
- UMANOSUKE SAID TODAY'S
ANOTHER DAY JUST LIKE

160
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,958
ALL THE OTHER DAYS.
HE SAYS THAT EVERY DAY.

161
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,625
DIDN'T YOU HEAR HIM?

162
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,666
- NO, I THOUGHT HE SAID
TODAY'S LIKE ALL OTHER DAYS.

163
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,083
OF COURSE TODAY IS LIKE
ALL THE OTHER DAYS,

164
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,958
JUST AS BORING
AS THE REST OF 'EM.

165
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,666
- ( laughing )
- ( screams )

166
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,166
I CAN'T TAKE IT.
WE'VE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE!

167
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:41,375
- LORD TENCHI, I'M COMING TO YOU
ON "THE JUYO LINE OF LOVE"

168
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,375
JUST LIKE ON TV.

169
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,291
- ( loud rumbling )
- OOH!

170
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,291
OH!

171
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,125
I'M NOT GETTING OFF HERE!

172
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,125
STOP PUSHING ME!

173
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,333
TENCHI!

174
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,583
- ( meows )

175
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:13,458
- I THINK THIS IS THE BEGINNING
OF THE AMAGASAKI EMPIRE.

176
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,416
- WITH YOU AS EMPEROR,
I DON'T THINK SO.

177
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,625
- ( gasps )
WHAT IS THIS?

178
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,916
OH!

179
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,208
- WE HAVE SEALED THE EVIL ONE
IN THIS STYGIAN VAULT

180
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,583
FOR ALL ETERNITY.

181
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,750
HENCEFORTH, NONE SHALL APPROACH
THIS MYSTIC CHAMBER.

182
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,416
HE WHO ATTEMPTS
TO BREAK THE SEAL

183
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,208
SHALL BE STRICKEN
WITH DISASTER.

184
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,916
- WHAT WAS THAT?

185
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,500
- HEY, ARE YOU OKAY, TENCHI?

186
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,375
- YOU GOT A HEADACHE?

187
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,333
- IT'S NOTHING.
I'M JUST A LITTLE DIZZY.

188
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,333
I SAW SOMETHING, A VISION.

189
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:54,041
BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

190
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,541
- WHERE IS HE?
TENCHI CAN'T JUST BE MISSING.

191
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,583
- HE IS.
SO ARE UMANOSUKE AND KAZUHIKO.

192
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,000
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

193
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,875
- DID YOU HEAR THE NEWS?
TENCHI'S GROUP HAS DISAPPEARED.

194
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,416
- THEY PROBABLY WENT
TO GET A PIZZA.

195
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,125
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.
- ALL YOU EVER THINK OF IS FOOD.

196
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,958
- TENCHI.

197
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,625
- IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE,

198
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,625
BUT MAYBE TENCHI'S FALLEN

199
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,833
INTO THE MAGNIFICENT WORLD.

200
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,958
- EXCUSE ME.
PARDON ME, MA'AM,

201
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,541
BUT I'M LOOKING
FOR MY LORD TENCHI.

202
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,291
I MEAN, A STUDENT NAMED TENCHI.
- HUH?

203
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:26,625
TENCHI?

204
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,291
- IT'S YOU, MIHOSHI.

205
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:31,291
- WOW, PRINCESS AYEKA.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

206
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,958
( screams )

207
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,166
- THEY'RE ANCIENT RELICS,
MIHOSHI!

208
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,666
- I KNOW IT'S A STONE CRYPT,

209
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,708
AND AN EVIL ONE IS IN IT.

210
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,500
( grunts )

211
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,333
IT'S BROKEN!

212
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:53,625
- ( laughs )
I'D STILL BE SLEEPING DEEPLY

213
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,750
IF THAT EARTHQUAKE
THREE MONTHS AGO HADN'T DROPPED

214
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:59,458
A HUGE ROCK ON MY SARCOPHAGUS.
- AND WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING?

215
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:02,916
- I'M NOT PLANNING ANYTHING,
BUT THERE IS AN INTERESTING BOY

216
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,041
I'VE SET MY SIGHTS UPON.

217
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:09,958
- TENCHI, ISN'T IT DANGEROUS
IF YOU GET TOO CLOSE TO IT?

218
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:12,041
- I THINK IT'S OKAY.

219
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,583
- ( laughs )
WELL, I FOUND A GOOD SEAT.

220
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:18,250
THIS WILL BE THE THRONE OF THE
KING OF THE AMAGASAKI DYNASTY.

221
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:21,166
YOU WILL BE THE MINISTERS
OF MY IMPERIAL EMPIRE.

222
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,416
- ( sighs )

223
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,375
- ALL RIGHT, YOU CAN APPROACH
THE ROYAL THRONE.

224
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:29,583
- HEY, AMAGASAKI!
- OH!

225
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:35,041
- ( gasps ) AZAKA, KAMIDAKE.
WHY ARE THEY HERE?

226
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,083
- Amagasaki: YOU TWO LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE GETTING SMALLER,

227
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,208
LIKE LITTLE INSECTS.

228
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,416
GUESS THIS IS THE WAY
THE WORLD LOOKS

229
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,708
WHEN YOU BECOME
A GREAT ROYAL MONARCH.

230
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,625
DON'T WORRY.
YOU'RE STILL MY FRIENDS.

231
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,625
JUST CALL ME
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.

232
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,625
- STOP BABBLING FOR A MINUTE
AND LOOK UNDERNEATH YOUR BUTT.

233
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:54,541
- WHAT?  UNDER MY BUTT?
HMM...

234
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,333
HUH?  HUH?

235
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:00,416
WHAT'S GOING ON?
( screams )

236
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,583
- THE ANCIENT CRYPT
IS NO LONGER SEALED.

237
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,750
THE EVIL ONE HAS ESCAPED
THE SEAL OF JURAI.

238
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:14,750
- JURAI?  SO THAT THING
CAME FROM PLANET JURAI.

239
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:18,000
I WARN YOU.  RETURN TO
THE STONE CRYPT VOLUNTARILY

240
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,916
OR YOU WILL BE FORCED
TO DO SO.

241
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,416
- STONE CRYPT.  WHAT THE HECK
ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT?

242
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,916
- FEAR NOT.
I'LL HANDLE THEM.

243
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,791
- WAIT, AMAGASAKI.  YOU DON'T
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH.

244
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,333
- HEY, HAVE A LITTLE LAUGH.
HERE'S A TIP.

245
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,541
DANCE AROUND AND FORGET
ABOUT THAT CREEPY CRYPT.

246
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,083
- UNACCEPTABLE RESPONSE.

247
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,250
- DANGEROUS ACTION.
SHIFT TO ATTACK MODE.

248
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,291
- ( screaming )

249
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,791
- LORD TENCHI, WHERE ARE YOU?
- TENCHI!

250
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,041
- TENCHI!

251
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,958
- HOW COULD TENCHI DISAPPEAR
WITHOUT A WORD?

252
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,125
HE WOULDN'T DO THAT,
WOULD HE, KIYONE?

253
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:02,541
UNLESS HE TRIPPED AND FELL
INTO A HOLE OR SOMETHING.

254
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,291
- SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING
YOU'D DO.

255
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,666
- THAT'S NOT FAIR AT ALL.
I MAY BE A LITTLE CLUMSY,

256
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,625
BUT I DON'T GO AROUND
FALLING IN HOLES.

257
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:10,833
( screaming )

258
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,416
- I'M TOO YOUNG TO DIE.  I DON'T
WANNA GO IN SOME CREEPY CRYPT.

259
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,458
- ( panting )

260
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,333
- HUH?
- IT'S A DEAD END.

261
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,041
- HUH?
- THIS IS YOUR FINAL WARNING.

262
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,666
RETURN TO YOUR CRYPTS.

263
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,833
- WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO GO
INSIDE OF SOME OLD COFFIN FOR?

264
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,208
THAT'S TOTALLY SICK.

265
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,083
- THEY'VE GOT US MIXED UP
WITH AN EVIL DEMON

266
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,875
WHO'S SUPPOSED TO BE
IN THAT CRYPT.

267
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,125
- OH, THIS IS A DRAG!

268
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,916
- WARNING TIME OVER.
TERMINATE THEM.

269
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:47,083
- ( screaming )

270
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,125
- AYEKA!

271
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,666
- WHY, LORD TENCHI,
I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU.

272
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,583
- AND IT'S BECAUSE OF ME
THAT WE GOT HERE.

273
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,208
- YOU MEAN BECAUSE
OF YOUR CLUMSINESS?

274
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,166
- YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO POINT
THAT OUT, YOU KNOW?

275
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:06,416
OH, IT LOOKS JUST LIKE
THE SECRET FACE OF ORGON.

276
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,833
- WHAT IN THE WORLD'S THAT?

277
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,458
- YOU KNOW, THE VILLAINS

278
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,333
ON "SPACE POLICE POLICEMAN,"
THE TV SHOW.

279
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,625
THIS LOOKS JUST LIKE
THEIR UNDERGROUND HIDEOUT.

280
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,583
- THIS IS NOT TV,
SO CAN IT.

281
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,875
- THESE INTRUDERS ARE AGENTS
OF THE EVIL ONE.

282
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:23,541
- THEY MUST BE EXPUNGED AT ONCE.
COMMENCE TERMINATION PROTOCOL.

283
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:26,291
- TENCHI, THOSE ARE
JURAI GUARDIANS.

284
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,875
- OH!
- UGH!

285
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,791
- I AM AYEKA, THE FIRST PRINCESS
OF THE JURAI ROYAL FAMILY.

286
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,291
HOW DARE YOU ATTACK
A TRUE JURAI PRINCESS.

287
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,500
I ORDER YOU TO STOP THIS
AT ONCE.

288
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,875
- BIO VERIFICATION COMPLETE.

289
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,375
SHE IS THE FIRST PRINCESS
OF THE JURAI ROYAL FAMILY.

290
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,083
- OF COURSE I AM.
NOW GO AWAY.

291
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,583
- YES, MA'AM.
- AS YOU COMMAND.

292
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,583
- YOU REALLY SAVED ME, AYEKA.

293
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:57,083
- WHY, IT'S MY PLEASURE, TENCHI.
I'D DO ANYTHING FOR YOU.

294
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,875
NOW WHAT I WANT TO KNOW
IS WHY ARE THERE GUARDIANS

295
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,416
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS,
AND THEY'RE SUCH OLD MODELS.

296
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,750
- THAT'S NOT ALL, AYEKA.
LOOK OVER THERE.

297
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:08,750
- THAT'S JURAIEAN.
IT'S A SEALED SHRINE.

298
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,916
- SO ARE YOU GONNA END IT NOW?

299
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,333
- THAT WOULD SPOIL THE FUN,
WOULDN'T IT?

300
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,541
BUT WHAT ELSE
CAN YOU EXPECT

301
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,875
WHEN THE JURAI ROYAL FAMILY
GETS INVOLVED?

302
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,333
- GUARDIANS.

303
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,000
- HMM.

304
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:25,291
YOU LOOK LIKE
AZAKA AND KAMIDAKE.

305
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,458
- Both: TERMINATE!  TERMINATE!
TERMINATE!  TERMINATE!

306
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,958
- HUH?
- WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?

307
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,708
- TERMINATE!  TERMINATE!
TERMINATE!  TERMINATE!

308
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,208
- WHY ARE THEY SHOOTING AT US?

309
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,750
- YOU WERE POKING AT THEM,
MIHOSHI.

310
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,666
YOU MUST HAVE MADE THEM MAD.

311
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,000
- BUT I DIDN'T POKE THEM HARD.

312
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,125
- TERMINATE!  TERMINATE!
TERMINATE!  TERMINATE!

313
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,041
- STOP NOW.
I AM THE FIRST PRINCESS

314
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,791
OF THE JURAI ROYAL FAMILY.
- TERMINATE! TERMINATE!

315
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,416
- IMPOSSIBLE!  HOW CAN
GUARDIANS REFUSE MY ORDERS?

316
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,166
IT'S HERESY.
- BACK ME UP, MIHOSHI.

317
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,583
- TERMINATE!  TERMINATE!

318
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,625
- I WOULD BACK YOU UP,
BUT I LOST MY GUN.

319
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,541
WHERE DID I PUT THAT THING?
- MIHOSHI.

320
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,125
- OH!
- TERMINATE! TERMINATE!

321
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,958
- ( screaming )

322
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,958
- YOU DARE ATTACK LORD TENCHI.
YOU'RE HISTORY!

323
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,500
- ALL RIGHT!
- YOU'RE HOT, PRINCESS.

324
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:21,000
- TERMINATE!  TERMINATE!
- TERMINATE!  TERMINATE!

325
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:24,000
- TERMINATE!
- HUH?!

326
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:27,250
- ( all scream )
- WATCH OUT, AYEKA.

327
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,666
- ( screams )

328
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,666
- KAMIDAKE.
- AZAKA, SIR.

329
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,333
- BLAST OFF!
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

330
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:35,750
- WOW!
- ( meows )

331
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,916
- ( screaming )

332
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,583
- HANG ON, AYEKA.

333
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,958
- ( screaming )

334
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,416
- TERMINATE!  TERMINATE!

335
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,375
- ( groans )
I CAN'T HOLD OUT ANY LONGER.

336
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,750
- WE'RE GOING IN.
- TEENAGERS.

337
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,708
- LORD TENCHI, I'M SORRY.

338
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:08,583
- AYEKA, NO!

339
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,875
- WHOA!

340
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,750
- HUH?

341
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,458
- Azaka:
WE HAVE ARRIVED!

342
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:29,708
- AZAKA, KAMIDAKE,
AM I GLAD TO SEE YOU.

343
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,916
IT IS OUR DUTY AS GUARDIANS
TO PROTECT YOU

344
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,708
FROM ALL HARM,
PRINCESS.

345
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,833
- WE WILL GO ANYWHERE, ANYTIME
TO PROTECT YOU FROM DANGER.

346
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:40,750
- HMM.
- TERMINATE!  TERMINATE!

347
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,166
- TIME FOR ACTION, KAMIDAKE.
- YES, SIR.

348
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,083
- TERMINATE!
- ELIMINATE!

349
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,083
- ( grunting )

350
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,625
- IT'S SO WEIRD.  THEY LOOK
LIKE A BUNCH OF BIG LOGS

351
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:58,791
BUMPING INTO EACH OTHER.
- THEY CHARGE WITH A LOT

352
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,958
OF OOMPH,
BUT IT IS A WEIRD BATTLE.

353
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,583
- FINISH THEM,
AZAKA, KAMIDAKE.

354
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:06,750
- Both: YES, MA'AM.

355
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,375
- OPEN FIRE.
- RIGHT.

356
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,833
- ( screaming )

357
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,708
- WOW!  IT'S JUST LIKE
"SPACE POLICE POLICEMAN."

358
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,791
- WOULD YOU FORGET
ABOUT THAT TV SHOW ALREADY?

359
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,958
- THIS TOMB DEFINITELY BELONGS
TO OUR PLANET JURAI.

360
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:39,208
- INDEED.
- WHAT'S IT DOING HERE ON EARTH?

361
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,708
- I DON'T KNOW.  HOWEVER,
THERE WAS SOMEONE SEALED INSIDE.

362
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,291
SEALED BY A JURAIEAN
LORD OR PRIEST,

363
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:48,875
BUT WAS IT FOR GOOD OR EVIL?
THAT'S THE MYSTERY.

364
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,958
- Tenchi:
SOMETHING CAME FROM PLANET JURAI

365
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,458
TO EARTH 3,500 YEARS AGO.

366
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,791
WHAT WAS IT?

367
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,833
- WHERE WERE YOU AND WHAT HAVE
YOU BEEN DOING ALL THIS TIME?

368
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,250
I ALREADY TOLD YOU.
THERE'S A ROYAL TOMB

369
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,791
OF THE AMAGASAKI EMPIRE,
AND WE WERE THERE INSIDE--

370
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,000
- COME ON!  IF YOU'RE GONNA LIE,
AT LEAST COME UP

371
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,791
WITH A BETTER STORY THAN THAT.

372
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,250
- WELL, THAT WAS ENTERTAINING.

373
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,666
- HOPE IT DIDN'T STIR UP
UNPLEASANT MEMORIES.

374
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,000
- NOT REALLY. ( laughs )

375
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,958
I CAN'T WAIT
TO RAISE MY CASTLE

376
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,583
TO THE SURFACE 
OF THIS PLANET.

377
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,916
OF COURSE, THERE ARE MANY
DELICIOUS PREPARATIONS

378
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,916
WE HAVE TO MAKE FIRST.

379
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,041
( laughing )

380
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:45,750
- ( theme music playing )

381
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,750
- ( singing in Japanese )

382
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,416
- ( meowing )

383
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:14,708
- HOWDY.  I'M RYOKO.
YOU KNOW WHAT, TENCHI?

384
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:17,625
I CAN BE REAL FEMININE
IF I PUT SOME MAKEUP ON.

385
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:19,625
I KNOW I CAN LOOK STUNNING
IF I TRY.

386
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,000
LOOK AT ME.
AREN'T I GORGEOUS?

387
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,916
YOU WANNA SEE?
YOU DO WANNA SEE, DON'T YOU?

388
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,958
I KNOW YOU DO.  ALL RIGHT,
YOU CAN SEE ME TOMORROW

389
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,916
WHEN WE HAVE A DATE.
YOU AND ME.

390
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,916
I'M WARNING YOU THOUGH.
I'LL BE SO STUNNING,

391
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,666
THAT YOU MAY BE
KNOCKED OUT COLD.

392
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,125
THE NEXT EPISODE OF
NEW "TENCHI MUYO" SERIES

393
