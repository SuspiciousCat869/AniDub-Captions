1
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:36,833
- ( theme music plays )

2
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:46,291
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,583
- ( Yugi laughs )

4
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,500
IT'S STARTING NOW.

5
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,208
IT'LL HAPPEN VERY SOON.

6
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,708
( laughs )

7
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,291
- Noboyuki:
IT'S GONE! 

8
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,208
GONE! GONE! GONE! GONE!

9
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,541
IT CAN'T BE!

10
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,750
LET'S SEE.
NO, IT'S NOT IN THIS ONE.

11
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,750
NOPE, NOT THIS ONE.
NO, NO, NO, NO!

12
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:36,083
IT JUST VANISHED.

13
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,041
- LA, LA, LA, LA.
- ( meowing )

14
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,083
- AH, SASAMI.
- HUH?

15
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,166
- I SEEM TO HAVE
LOST SOMETHING HERE.

16
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,750
IT'S ABOUT THIS BIG.

17
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,250
- ( squeaks )
- ( groans ) 

18
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,708
AH! I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING

19
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,625
ABOUT AN ENVELOPE THAT
WAS ALL FULL OF MONEY.

20
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:50,750
I NEVER SET EYES ON IT.

21
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,375
WELL, GOT TO GO.

22
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:53,791
- ALL RIGHT.

23
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,083
WELL, THANKS ANYWAY
FOR YOUR HELP.

24
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,625
BUT WHERE COULD
IT HAVE GONE?

25
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,583
- CHOCOLATE, CANDIES,
AND THE COOKIES.

26
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,083
- WE'RE NOT GOING
ON A PICNIC.

27
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,250
WE'RE GOING TO SEE TENCHI.
THIS IS SERIOUS.

28
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,708
NOW I WANT YOU TO LEAVE ALL
THESE SNACKS HERE, MIHOSHI.

29
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,416
- OKAY, BUT YOU WOULDN'T CALL
THESE BANANAS SNACKS, WOULD YOU?

30
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,583
- OF COURSE THEY ARE.

31
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:14,416
- OH, HOW ABOUT APPLES?
- THEY'RE SNACKS.

32
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,416
- NOT THESE ORANGES.
- SNACKS.

33
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,583
- WATERMELON? COCONUT?

34
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,250
( grunts )
- THEY'RE SNACKS

35
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,458
AND WE'RE
NOT TAKING THEM.

36
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,833
- Ayeka:
ATTENTION, EVERYONE.

37
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,833
THANKS TO FATHER'S KIND,
IF UNINTENDED, CONTRIBUTION,

38
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,166
WE NOW HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
TO MAKE THIS TRIP.

39
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,833
THE TIME HAS COME
AT LONG LAST

40
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,125
TO CROSS THAT THRESHOLD.

41
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,083
TENCHI MUST TELL US
HIS HONEST FEELINGS

42
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,166
AND THEN WE WILL
ALL KNOW THE TRUTH.

43
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,666
- NICE SPEECH IF
YOU LIKE GARBAGE.

44
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,708
- HMM?

45
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,250
YOU WOULDN'T BE
TALKING TO ME NOW,

46
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,625
WOULD YOU, RYOKO?
- NO.

47
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,958
I'M TALKING TO SOME OTHER
CLUELESS SPACE PRINCESS.

48
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,625
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE UP TO,

49
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:46,875
BUT YOU'RE FORGETTING
THAT TENCHI

50
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,458
WENT TO TOKYO TO STUDY.

51
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:49,958
AS SERIOUS AS HE IS,

52
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,625
YOU REALLY THINK
HE'D GO AND GET INVOLVED

53
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:52,958
WITH THAT LITTLE FLIRT
SAKUYA?

54
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,625
NOT TENCHI.
NO WAY.

55
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:55,875
- WELL, I'M SURE
YOU'RE RIGHT.

56
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,333
YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEST, DEAR.

57
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,250
- NO DOUBT TENCHI'S
MADE SOME NEW FRIENDS.

58
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,541
THAT'S ONLY NATURAL.
HE HAS HIS OWN SOCIAL LIFE

59
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,208
AND IF YOU INTERFERE WITH IT,

60
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,291
I BET HE'S GOING TO BE
REALLY ANGRY WITH YOU,

61
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,166
CAPISCE?
- ( growls )

62
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,500
THAT'S ACTUALLY QUITE
UNDERSTANDING OF YOU, RYOKO.

63
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,416
- I AM VERY UNDERSTANDING
BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN TENCHI

64
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,333
UNLIKE A CERTAIN SELFISH
JURAI PRINCESS WE ALL KNOW.

65
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,208
- I BELIEVE IN HIM.

66
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,833
BUT MY BELIEFS AND FEELINGS
ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.

67
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,833
MY FEELINGS ARE OVERWHELMING.

68
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,833
THAT'S WHY I NEED 
TO SEE LORD TENCHI

69
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,500
AND FIND OUT HOW HE FEELS.

70
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,000
I SIMPLY HAVE GOT 
TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

71
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,708
- FINE, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

72
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,500
- DON'T WORRY, I WILL.

73
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,000
- COME ON, EVERYONE.

74
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,166
WE'RE GOING TO SHIBUYA.

75
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,583
- ON OUR WAY.

76
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,583
- ( fireworks pop )

77
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,833
- DON'T MISS THE LIVE CONCERT
AT 2:00 PM.

78
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,875
AND WELCOME TO
THE SCHOOL CARNIVAL.

79
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,000
- ( sizzling )

80
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,375
- ( popping )

81
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,291
- Sugano:
DELICIOUS CREPES RIGHT HERE.

82
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,458
GET 'EM WHILE THEY'RE HOT.

83
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,958
- ( grunts )
- Umanosuke: YO', TENCHI.

84
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,583
THEY GOT YOU WORKING, HUH?
- ( gasps )

85
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,333
- YOU'RE HELPING SAKUYA,
AREN'T YOU?

86
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,333
STIRRING THE DOUGH FOR HER,
THAT'S A GOOD MOVE.

87
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,875
- WELL, YEAH, SHE'S GOT
THIS FOOD BOOTH, YOU KNOW?

88
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:06,375
AND SHE NEEDED SOME HELP 
SO I KIND OF VOLUNTEERED.

89
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:07,625
- YEAH, RIGHT.
I BET YOU DID.

90
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,833
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

91
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,375
I WAS PLANNING ON DOING
MUCH THE SAME THING.

92
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,791
HMM, HMM, HMM, HMM.

93
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,500
I'VE ALSO DECIDED I'M GONNA
ASK A GIRL TO GO STEADY TONIGHT.

94
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,250
WHAT DO YOU THINK, TENCHI?
- HUH?

95
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,250
- YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,

96
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,666
IF YOU GET ROMANTIC
WITH A GIRL

97
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,958
AFTER THE SCHOOL CARNIVAL,

98
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,708
SHE'LL FALL FOR YOU
LIKE A TON OF BRICKS.

99
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:23,916
YOU'VE HEARD ALL THE STORIES,
HAVEN'T YOU?

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,625
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
- YEAH.

101
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,416
I GUESS I HEARD
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

102
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,416
- Girl: HELLO, THERE.
- Both: HUH?

103
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,208
- HURRY UP WITH THAT FISH,
COME ON.

104
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,666
- JUST A SECOND.

105
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,333
WISH ME LUCK. OH, AND GOOD
LUCK TO YOU WITH SAKUYA TOO.

106
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,625
WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE,
ME AND THE FISH THAT IS.

107
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,291
- WHAT IS HE DOING
WITH THAT THING?

108
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,500
WELL, MAYBE I DON'T
WANT TO KNOW.

109
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,250
- HEY, YOU'RE NOT
EVEN STIRRING, TENCHI.

110
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,125
COME ON, WE'RE RUNNING
OUT OF DOUGH.

111
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,583
- OH, RIGHT.
NO PROBLEM. 

112
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,125
- TENCHI'S SO CUTE
WORKING LIKE THAT.

113
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,291
I THINK HE'S DOING
IT FOR YOU.

114
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,750
- HE'S NICE, ISN'T HE?

115
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,250
- BETTER THAN NICE.

116
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,833
YOU'RE LUCKY TO HAVE A BOYFRIEND
LIKE THAT, SAKUYA.

117
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,208
IF HE'S GOT A TWIN BROTHER,
SEND HIM MY WAY.

118
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,416
- IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.
I MEAN, HE'S NOT MY BOYFRIEND.

119
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,416
- REALLY?  YOU SURE 
COULD HAVE FOOLED ME

120
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,416
THE WAY YOU ACT AROUND HIM.

121
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,958
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU ASK HIM

122
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,916
TO GO STEADY
AFTER THE CARNIVAL?

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,083
- HUH?
BUT I WOULDN'T DO THAT.

124
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,958
- WHY NOT? GIRLS CAN ASK BOYS.
IT'S A TRADITION.

125
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,208
- I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.
I'M SELLING FOOD, HERE.

126
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,916
I'M NOT LOOKING 
FOR A BOYFRIEND.

127
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,291
- RIGHT, THAT'S WHY YOU
WERE BLUSHING A MINUTE AGO.

128
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:23,791
- ( groans )
THE CREPE IS BURNING.

129
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,416
- Sugano: GIVE IT TO ME.
OOH, OUCH!

130
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,916
- HEY, DON'T BREAK THE DISHES.
- ( dish breaks )

131
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,833
- ( doorbell rings )

132
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,208
- LORD, TENCHI.

133
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,833
LORD TENCHI?

134
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:38,208
HE'S NOT ANSWERING THE DOOR.
I WONDER WHERE HE IS.

135
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,791
I MEAN, IT'S SUNDAY.
HE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE HOME

136
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,083
STUDYING OR DOING HOMEWORK
OR SOMETHING.

137
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,791
- HE WASN'T AT
THE TSUCHIDA SHRINE.

138
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,375
SO WHERE ELSE
MIGHT HE HAVE GONE?

139
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,458
- IT'S LUNCHTIME SO HE MUST
HAVE GONE OUT TO LUNCH.

140
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,541
YEAH, THAT'S NATURAL.

141
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,375
- WE SHOULD HAVE
TOLD HIM WE WERE COMING.

142
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,041
WHY DOES IT HAVE
TO BE A BIG MYSTERY.

143
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,500
IF YOU ASK ME, YOU GIRLS 
ARE GETTING REALLY WEIRD.

144
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,291
- WE'RE NOT WEIRD.
IT'S JUST WITH SAKUYA AROUND,

145
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,375
TENCHI DOESN'T ALWAYS
TELL US WHAT'S HAPPENING.

146
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,500
THAT'S THE POINT.

147
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,791
WE HAD TO COME LIKE THIS
WITHOUT WARNING.

148
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,791
THIS WAY, WE'LL FIND OUT
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON. 

149
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,333
TENCHI WILL HAVE
TO TELL US THE TRUTH.

150
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,416
- SO ARE WE GONNA STAND HERE
AND MAKE SPEECHES

151
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,500
OR ARE WE GONNA GO INSIDE
AND WAIT FOR TENCHI?

152
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,708
- BUT WE DON'T
HAVE THE KEY. 

153
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,208
- KEY'S ARE SO OLD-FASHIONED.
THIS IS MUCH BETTER.

154
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,375
CHECK IT OUT,
MY NEW POWER GLOVE.

155
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,583
- ( grunts ) 
- ( gasping )

156
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,833
- SEE, IT'S EASY.
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

157
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,458
YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO SEE IT.
COME ON IN.

158
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,666
- IT'S EMPTY.
TENCHI REALLY ISN'T HERE.

159
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,166
NOT THAT I THOUGHT HE
WAS AVOIDING US OR ANYTHING

160
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,041
BY PRETENDING
NOT TO BE HERE.

161
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,791
- WELL, SINCE WE DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE WENT,

162
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,166
I GUESS WE'LL JUST
HAVE TO SIT DOWN

163
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,875
AND WAIT UNTIL
HE COMES BACK HOME.

164
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:44,125
- ( meows )
- YES, WE DON'T HAVE ANY CHOICE.

165
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,333
- ( meowing )

166
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:48,583
- WHOA, WHAT IS IT, RYO-OHKI?

167
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,541
- Ayeka: OOH, IT'S A FLYER
FOR A SCHOOL CARNIVAL.

168
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,583
- ( chattering )

169
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,750
- Tenchi: WOW,
IT LOOKS DELICIOUS.

170
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,791
- GO AHEAD.
DIG IN, TENCHI.

171
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,666
- DON'T MIND IF I DO.

172
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,500
- IS IT ALL RIGHT?

173
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,208
- HMM, IT'S GOOD.

174
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,083
I'VE NEVER TASTED
ANYTHING SO DELICIOUS.

175
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,458
- OKAY.

176
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:09,958
I'M TAKING CULINARY LESSONS,
YOU KNOW?

177
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,041
IT'S GOURMET CUISINE.

178
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,791
- I GET THE PICTURE.

179
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:13,833
HUH?

180
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,875
- OH.
( laughs )

181
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,291
- ( both laugh )

182
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,750
- OH, TENCHI, YOU WANT TO GO SEE
THAT CONCERT TOGETHER?

183
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,208
- CONCERT?

184
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,875
- YEAH, AT 2:00 IN THE GYM,
IT'S A LIVE BAND.

185
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,375
COME ON, IT'LL BE FUN.

186
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,625
- WELL, I'D LIKE TO GO,

187
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:27,791
BUT WHAT ABOUT
YOUR FOOD BOOTH?

188
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,291
YOU KNOW, THE CREPES
AND EVERYTHING?

189
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,416
- OH, I DON'T THINK
WE'LL HAVE ANY CUSTOMERS THEN.

190
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,500
I MEAN, EVERYONE WILL BE
AT THE CONCERT.

191
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,250
REMEMBER,
THIS IS OUR CARNIVAL.

192
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,541
YOU GOT TO BE TRUE TO YOUR 
SCHOOL AND ALL THAT, RIGHT?

193
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:38,875
- WELL, WHEN YOU 
PUT IT LIKE THAT,

194
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,458
HOW CAN I REFUSE?
LET'S DO IT.

195
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:41,833
- HM-HMM.

196
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,166
- ( laughing )
- ( meowing ) 

197
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,125
- ( crowd chatters )

198
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,416
- COME ON, KIYONE,
BUY ME SOME FOOD. 

199
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,000
OH, PLEASE, I'M SO HUNGRY.

200
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,375
THEY'VE GOT CREPES HERE,
AND FRIED NOODLES...

201
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,583
AND THE SHISH KABOB
LOOKS GOOD TOO.

202
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,250
- FORGET IT, MIHOSHI.
I'M NOT PAYING

203
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,000
FOR YOUR SNACKS.
- ( cries )

204
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,166
- WE'VE LOOKED ALL OVER,

205
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,750
BUT I DON'T SEE
LORD TENCHI ANYWHERE.

206
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:02,750
I WONDER WHERE HE IS.

207
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,041
- WITH ALL THESE
PEOPLE HERE,

208
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,666
IT'S LIKE LOOKING FOR
A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK.

209
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,208
- BUT HE HAS TO
BE HERE SOMEWHERE.

210
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,416
THIS IS HIS SCHOOL.

211
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,666
HE WOULDN'T MISS
THEIR BIG CARNIVAL.

212
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,916
WHY DON'T WE SPLIT UP?

213
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,125
WE'LL HAVE A BETTER CHANCE
OF FINDING HIM.

214
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,208
- ( smirks )
LOOKS LIKE FUN, DOESN'T IT?

215
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,000
- ( birds twitter )

216
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:22,000
- MIYUKI, DEAR.
- DOCTOR.

217
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,791
- Narrator: AT LAST,
MIYUKI HAD FOUND TRUE LOVE.

218
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,875
NOW HER ONLY WISH

219
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,541
WAS THAT HIS HAPPINESS
COULD LAST FOREVER AND EVER.

220
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,000
HOW COULD SHE HAVE KNOWN

221
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,541
THAT IN THE NEXT INSTANT,

222
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,375
A SUPER, GIANT METEOR

223
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,250
WOULD CRASH INTO JAPAN.

224
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,916
- ( explosion )

225
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,083
- RIGHT, IT'S
ALWAYS A METEOR.

226
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,375
( slurps )

227
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:49,125
AND NOTHING LEFT TO EAT
BUT INSTANT NOODLES.

228
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,666
( swallows )

229
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,041
WITH SASAMI GONE, THERE'S NO
ONE HERE TO COOK DINNER.

230
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,666
I'M CERTAINLY NOT
GOING TO DO IT.

231
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,541
IT'S BENEATH
A SPACE PIRATE'S DIGNITY.

232
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,166
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE
GONE WITH THEM

233
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,666
EVEN IF THEY ARE ANNOYING.

234
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,125
- OH, RYOKO, THERE YOU ARE.

235
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,458
- I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT

236
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:04,666
A MISSING ENVELOPE
FULL OF MONEY.

237
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,083
SO DON'T DARE ASK.

238
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,375
- OH, I SEE.

239
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,458
WELL, I WONDER WHERE
IT COULD HAVE GONE. 


240
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,750
- ( sighs )


241
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,250
I WISH I KNEW WHAT TENCHI
WAS DOING RIGHT NOW.

242
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,125
- ( crowd chatters )

243
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,083
- I BETTER HURRY.
I PROMISED SAKUYA

244
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,291
I'D MEET HER
FOR THE CONCERT.

245
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,208
AHH!

246
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,875
IT CAN'T BE.

247
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,458
AYEKA?

248
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,416
NO, I'M JUST
IMAGINING THINGS.

249
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,000
THE DIMENSION TUNNEL'S SEALED.

250
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,666
THEY CAN'T COME HERE.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

251
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,166
FUNNY HOW YOUR MIND
CAN TRICK YOU.

252
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,500
( laughs )
- Sasami: RYO-OHKI!

253
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,791
- ( groans )

254
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,916
- RYO-OHKI!
RYO-OHKI, WAIT FOR ME!

255
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,500
- THERE HERE.

256
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,958
- ( meows )

257
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,708
- ( meows )

258
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,041
- THIS IS BAD.

259
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,333
WHAT IN THE WORLD
ARE THEY UP TO?

260
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,875
- ( frightened mutters )
- OH NO! THAT'S A GUN.

261
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,041
- ( whimpers )

262
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,583
- OH, SHE SHOT MY BOOTH.

263
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,541
- OH MY GOD.
- ( whispering )

264
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,958
- WOW, HOW COULD I MISS
AN EASY TARGET LIKE THAT?

265
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,875
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
WRONG WITH MY BLASTER. 

266
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,875
- THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH YOUR HEAD, MIHOSHI.

267
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,041
- Tenchi: WHAT ARE 
YOU TWO DOING HERE?

268
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,791
- HUH?

269
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,041
- OH, HI, TENCHI.

270
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,958
- WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

271
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,250
I GUESS YOU HEARD
THE GUNSHOT.

272
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,791
- THIS BETTER BE GOOD,
MIHOSHI.

273
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,208
NOW WHAT'S GOING ON?

274
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,416
- ( excited exclaims )
- ( meowing )

275
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,375
- THE SCIENCE LAB!

276
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,083
- EUREKA! A NEW DISCOVERY!

277
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,583
WHO COULD HAVE IMAGINED
RIGHT HERE AT OUR SCHOOL,

278
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,583
I'VE DISCOVERED
A NEW SPECIES OF RODENT?

279
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,541
I'M GONNA BE
RICH AND FAMOUS.

280
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,750
THEY'LL NEVER
MAKE FUN OF ME AGAIN.

281
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,916
THEY CALLED ME NERDO,
FOUR-EYES, MOUTH-BREATHER.

282
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,750
BUT NOW I'LL GO DOWN
IN HISTORY AS RODENT-MAN.

283
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:47,208
- ( meowing )
- SOMEBODY CATCH THAT THING.

284
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,416
I'M GOING TO BE ON 
DAYTIME TALK SHOWS.

285
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,041
THE PAPARAZZI WILL
BE ALL OVER ME.

286
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,125
STOP! TALK TO MY AGENT FIRST.

287
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,333
- ( meowing )

288
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,416
- NO ESCAPE! HIYAH!

289
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,791
- ( meows )

290
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,791
- NOW, MY LITTLE
RODENT SPECIMEN,

291
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,375
WE WILL NEVER FORGET 
THE VALIANT SACRIFICE

292
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,916
YOU ARE ABOUT TO MAKE FOR
THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE,

293
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,541
THE ADVANCEMENT OF MANKIND,

294
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,541
AND THE ADVANCEMENT
OF MY OWN CAREER.

295
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,583
- ( meowing )

296
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,500
( meowing )
- ( screams )

297
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,458
- WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE?
- WHO CARES?

298
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,041
IT'S TIME FOR THE CONCERT.
- ( grunts )

299
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,166
- ( yelps )
- OH, TENCHI, IT'S YOU.

300
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,666
- RYO-OHKI IS IN SOME
KIND OF TROUBLE.

301
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,208
- I KNOW.

302
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,208
- ( explosions )

303
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,166
- ( panting )

304
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,708
( shouts )

305
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,416
- RYO-OHKI.
- ( meows )

306
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,333
- CALM DOWN.
EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT.

307
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,041
YOU'RE SAFE NOW, RYO-OHKI.

308
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,833
- DON'T MOVE. WE'LL GET
SOME MEDICS UP HERE.

309
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,000
JUST HANG IN THERE.

310
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,333
- ( whimpers )
TELL THE PAPARAZZI

311
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,416
( shudders )
I DID IT FOR SCIENCE.

312
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,541
- EVERYTHING'S OKAY.
NO ONE'S GONNA HURT YOU NOW.

313
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,000
- RYO-OHKI, LOOK AT
THE DAMAGE YOU'VE DONE.

314
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,250
- ( meows )
- ( explosion )

315
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,291
- ( screams )

316
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:01,041
OH NO.  WHAT NEXT?

317
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,166
- SO DOES IT WORK?

318
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,708
- UM, NO,
IT'S TOTALLY BROKEN.

319
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,000
HUH?
- OH, WELL, WELL,

320
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,625
THIS IS SUCH AN
OLD-FASHIONED SENSOR

321
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,083
AND THE MOTOR'S JUST A TOY.

322
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,958
IN ANY ENLIGHTENED PLANET
LIKE JURAI,

323
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:17,000
YOU COULDN'T GIVE AWAY 
A RAT GADGET LIKE THIS.

324
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,291
NOW, LET'S SEE.

325
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,916
- ( thinking )
WHAT HAPPENED TO TENCHI?

326
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,958
HE WAS SUPPOSED 
TO MEET ME HERE.

327
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,583
- Tenchi: DON'T YOU THINK
YOU'VE GONE A LITTLE TOO FAR?

328
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:33,041
- Ayeka: IT'S NOT MY
FAULT, TENCHI. REALLY.

329
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,208
THESE PEOPLE LIED TO ME.

330
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,916
THEY TOLD ME YOU WERE INSIDE.

331
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,541
AND THEN THEY SCARED ME
WITH THOSE TRICKS.

332
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,708
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO WRECK EVERYTHING.

333
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,750
I JUST WANTED TO FIND YOU.

334
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,375
- AYEKA!
- ( gasps )

335
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,041
- THEY WORKED SO HARD
TO BUILD THIS FOR THE CARNIVAL

336
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,458
AND YOU HAD TO DESTROY IT.

337
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,500
THEY WEREN'T TRYING
TO SCARE YOU.

338
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,083
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FUN.

339
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,833
- I'M SORRY, TENCHI.

340
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,541
IT'S JUST THAT
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

341
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:56,750
- I WANT YOU TO GO HOME!

342
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:57,833
- OH.

343
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,208
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT POSSESSED YOU

344
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,708
TO SUDDENLY INVADE MY LIFE,

345
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,708
BUT WE'LL JUST HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT IT LATER.

346
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,250
WAIT FOR ME AT MY APARTMENT
AND TRY NOT TO WRECK ANYTHING

347
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,583
IN THE MEAN TIME. 
- ( motor whirrs )

348
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:07,750
- ( groans )

349
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,041
DON'T--

350
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,875
DON'T TELL ME YOU BROUGHT
WASHU HERE WITH YOU.

351
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,333
- HM-HMM.

352
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,041
- HEAVEN HELP US.

353
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,916
- Girl: LOOK OUT!
SHE TURNED THAT SENSOR

354
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,166
INTO A GIANT RAT.

355
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,750
- WELL, EVERYONE'S
GONE OFF TO THE CONCERT

356
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,583
SO I CAN FINALLY RELAX
A LITTLE BIT.

357
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,458
THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT.

358
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,291
- ( motor whirrs )
- HUH?

359
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,916
WHAT'S THAT NOISE?

360
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,666
HMM?  A GIANT RAT
IS COMING THIS WAY.

361
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,208
- ( crashing )
- WHOA!

362
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,291
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

363
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,791
( groans )

364
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,791
- Girls:
( sigh )

365
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,541
- SO IT BUMPS INTO THINGS.

366
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:56,000
I THOUGHT I FIXED IT 
BEFORE I ENLARGED IT,

367
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,958
BUT, WELL, YOU CAN
ONLY DO SO MUCH

368
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,500
WITH THIS
INFERIOR TECHNOLOGY.

369
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,375
- WASHU!
- HI, TENCHI.

370
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,958
HOW'S IT GOING?
- IT'S GOING BAD. WHAT IS THAT?

371
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,458
- IT'S JUST A LITTLE GADGET
THE SCIENCE STUDENTS HAD.

372
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,250
I KIND OF BEEFED IT UP
A LITTLE BIT.

373
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,791
I THOUGHT THE STUDENTS
WOULD GET A THRILL

374
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,000
AND, YOU KNOW,
TEACH THEM SOMETHING

375
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,458
ABOUT ADVANCED SCIENCE.

376
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,625
BUT IT DIDN'T QUITE MAKE IT
THROUGH THE MAZE.

377
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,708
- THE SCHOOL'S NOT A MAZE.
YOU'VE GOT TO STOP IT.

378
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,708
- WELL, THAT'S KIND
OF A PROBLEM.

379
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,958
YOU SEE, I REMOVED
THE ON AND OFF SWITCH

380
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,625
'CAUSE IT WAS IN MY WAY
AND IT LOOKED FUNNY.

381
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,583
SO NOW WE'LL JUST HAVE TO LET
THE BATTERIES RUN OUT, YOU KNOW?

382
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,250
- ALL I KNOW IS THAT
YOU ARE A MENACE, WASHU.

383
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,375
- ( rat tires screech )

384
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,625
- ( gasps )

385
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,500
- TENCHI WOULDN'T
STAND ME UP.

386
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,041
AT LEAST I DON'T
THINK HE WOULD. 

387
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,666
- ( panting )

388
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,500
- MAYBE HE JUST DOESN'T
CARE ABOUT ME.

389
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,125
MAYBE I'VE BEEN ALL WRONG.

390
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,125
I GUESS I'LL JUST LEAVE.

391
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,208
- ( shrieks )

392
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,250
- ( crashing )

393
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,583
- ( gasps )
- RUN, SAKUYA, RUN!

394
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:55,541
AH!

395
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:57,625
- ( explosion )
- WHOA.

396
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:58,875
- WHAT WAS THAT?

397
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:08,708
- WHEW, THAT WAS CLOSE,
BUT WE STOPPED HIM.

398
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,583
RIGHT, TENCHI?
HUH?

399
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:13,666
HMM?

400
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,333
OH MY.

401
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,375
- TENCHI!

402
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,208
- YOU'RE NOT HURT OR ANYTHING,
ARE YOU, TENCHI?

403
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,916
- I CAN'T TAKE ANYMORE!
STOP IT!

404
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,833
- ( gasps )

405
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,333
- BUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
TENCHI?

406
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,125
- JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.
- ( gasps )

407
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,083
- I WANT YOU ALL
TO GO BACK HOME.

408
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,583
- BUT WE CAME TO SEE YOU.

409
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,708
- YOU'RE NOTHING BUT TROUBLE,
ALL OF YOU.

410
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,000
- BUT YOU MEAN--

411
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,458
- YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID.

412
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,041
( whimpers )

413
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,416
WELL, COME ON, EVERYONE.
LET'S GO.

414
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,416
- Girls: 
( sighs )

415
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,583
- TENCHI, THEY'RE LEAVING.

416
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,583
- HMM.

417
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,083
I HAD TO COME AND SAVE
TENCHI FROM THOSE GIRLS.

418
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:20,000
THEY'RE PROBABLY DRIVING HIM
CRAZY BY NOW.

419
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,958
SO HERE IT GOES.

420
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,541
OH, WHAT'S THIS?

421
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,750
HEY, TENCHI.

422
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:29,958
ARE YOU HERE?

423
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,958
( gasps )

424
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,750
NOBODY'S HOME.

425
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,666
I GUESS.

426
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,125
- ( fire crackling )

427
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,208
- I SEE, THEY CAME
ALL THE WAY FROM OKAYAMA.

428
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,583
THAT'S A LONG WAY.

429
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,625
- HMPH, A LONG WAY
TO RUIN OUR SCHOOL CARNIVAL.

430
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,125
WHAT A MESS.
- OH, WELL.

431
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,625
IT WAS FUN FOR ME ANYWAY

432
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,125
WHEN WE WORKED TOGETHER
AT THE FOOD BOOTH.

433
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,666
THAT WAS THE BEST PART
OF THE WHOLE DAY.

434
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,666
- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
THE BOOTH--

435
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,166
- DESTROYED, I KNOW.

436
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,041
BUT THEY WOULD HAVE 
TORN IT DOWN ANYWAY.

437
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,500
AT LEAST WE HAD A GOOD TIME
WHILE IT WAS THERE.

438
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:13,041
- I GUESS.

439
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,166
- TENCHI,
THIS WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

440
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,375
THERE'S NO REASON
FOR YOU TO FEEL BAD.

441
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,166
( gasps )
OH WOW.

442
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,875
- WHAT IS IT?
- OH, I DIDN'T EVEN

443
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,666
TAKE THE TIME TO THANK THEM
FOR SAVING ME

444
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,708
FROM THAT RAT THING.

445
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,041
I JUST TOTALLY FORGOT.
- UGH!

446
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,333
YOU DON'T NEED
TO THANK THEM.

447
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:27,500
THEY CAUSED THE WHOLE THING.

448
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:28,708
- THEY DIDN'T MEAN TO.

449
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,333
AND THEY TRIED
TO MAKE UP FOR IT.

450
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,958
I'LL THANK THEM THE NEXT TIME
THAT I SEE THEM.

451
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,000
OKAY?

452
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,875
- ( sighs )

453
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,708
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.
- HM-HMM.

454
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,166
- SAKUYA, ARE YOU COLD?

455
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,958
- ( sighs )
NOT REALLY.

456
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,208
I THINK I FEEL
KIND OF LONELY

457
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,875
'CAUSE THE CARNIVAL'S OVER.

458
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,875
- I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

459
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,500
- TENCHI.

460
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,541
- YES, SAKUYA?

461
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,541
- THEY SAY THAT
AFTER THE CARNIVAL,


462
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:06,916
YOU SHOULD GO TO
THE ONE YOU LOVE


463
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,166
AND TELL HIM HOW
YOU FEEL ABOUT HIM.


464
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,125
I WASN'T GONNA DO THAT


465
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,500
'CAUSE, WELL, I DON'T BELIEVE
IN THOSE SCHOOL LEGENDS.


466
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:16,208
IF I CAN BE WITH YOU
EVERY DAY

467
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,000
LIKE WE ARE AT SCHOOL,

468
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,208
THAT'S ENOUGH
TO MAKE ME HAPPY.

469
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:23,041
AND I MEAN THAT.
I REALLY DO.

470
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:27,500
BUT THEN, SOMETIMES
WHEN I'M FEELING CLOSE TO YOU,

471
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,458
SUDDENLY I'LL
FEEL SO FAR AWAY.

472
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:32,291
THAT'S HOW I FELT TODAY

473
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,041
WHEN YOU GOT ANGRY
AT THOSE GIRLS.

474
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,250
I'VE NEVER SEEN
YOU SO SERIOUS.

475
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,958
AND I COULD TELL THAT,
SOMEHOW,

476
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,250
THIS WAS REALLY 
IMPORTANT TO YOU

477
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,666
IN A SPECIAL WAY.

478
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,333
WHEN I REALIZED THAT,

479
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,083
I SUDDENLY FELT
SO JEALOUS OF THEM.

480
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,458
YES, I WAS JEALOUS
AND ALSO...

481
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,625
IT MADE ME SAD.
- OH.

482
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,083
SAKUYA.

483
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,250
- WHAT AM I DOING?

484
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,750
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO SAY ALL THAT.

485
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,958
THERE'S SO MUCH
GOING ON NOW.

486
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,791
I GUESS I'M JUST A LITTLE
CONFUSED RIGHT NOW.

487
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,750
SORRY.

488
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:33,083
- ( fire crackling )
- KISSY KISSY, LOVEY-DOVEY.

489
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,083
EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK,
IT'S THE SAME THING.

490
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,416
WHAT'S UP
WITH THIS SCHOOL?

491
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,291
AND WHERE'S TENCHI ANYWAY?
IT'S LIKE HE VANISHED.

492
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,541
MAYBE HE WENT
BACK HOME ALREADY.

493
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,625
( sighs )

494
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,958
TENCHI, TENCHI.

495
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,583
( gasps )

496
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,166
( gasps )

497
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,708
AH, HMM.

498
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,958
HMM.

499
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,958
( whimpers )

500
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,833
( growls )
HOW DARE YOU DO THIS.

501
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,208
- ( gasps )
- OH.

502
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,041
OH.
- OH.

503
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,958
- AT LAST, THE BONDS
THAT HOLD THEM TOGETHER

504
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,000
ARE COMING APART.

505
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,750
IT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE END
FOR HIS WHOLE FAMILY.

506
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,416
( chuckles )

507
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,083
- ( theme music plays )

508
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:08,958
- ( singing in Japanese )

509
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:06,000
- ( meowing )

510
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:09,875
( meows )

511
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,458
- Washu: HELLO,
YOUR DARLING WASHU HERE.

512
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:18,416
HMM, I SEE WHY THIS HOUSE
SEEMS SO QUIET.

513
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,958
RYOKO'S GONE.

514
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:21,875
WELL, I WOULDN'T WORRY
ABOUT HER AT ALL.

515
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:24,916
I KNOW HER. SHE'LL BE BACK
WHEN SHE FEELS LIKE IT.

516
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,958
IN THE MEAN TIME,

517
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,208
I'LL KEEP MYSELF
BUSY IN MY LAB

518
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:29,791
DOING SOME
IMPORTANT RESEARCH.

519
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,208
DON'T DISTURB ME, OKAY?

520
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:34,416
THE NEXT EPISODE OF
THE NEW TENCHI MUYO SERIES...

521
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:37,708
"DRIFTING AWAY."
