1
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,333
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,000
- ( grunts )

3
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,125
- ( chuckling )

4
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,083
( laughing )

5
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,750
WELL, LOOKS LIKE
I WIN AGAIN.

6
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,625
- ( whines )

7
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,875
MEOW?

8
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,750
AHH.

9
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,000
( squeals )

10
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,000
MEOW!

11
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:49,500
MEOW, MEOW, MEOW!

12
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:53,000
MEOW!

13
00:03:56,416 --> 00:04:00,125
MEOW!

14
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,000
- WHAT A WONDERFUL
SPRING MORNING.

15
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,000
MY MIND AND BODY
ARE SO PURE,

16
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,625
I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN REBORN.
- INDEED.

17
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,125
- I WROTE ALL NIGHT,
BUT IT'S FINISHED--

18
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,875
A POEM FOR MY BELOVED.

19
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,375
( clears throat )

20
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,666
"TENCHI MY LORD,
OH MY LORD TENCHI,

21
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,291
TENCHI MY LORD,
TENCHI MY LORD,

22
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,666
OH MY LORD TENCHI,

23
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,666
LA-LA, LOVE, LOVE."
- MEOW, MEOW, MEOW...

24
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,500
- THAT IS A SPLENDID POEM.

25
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,125
- AN EFFORT WORTHY
OF THE CROWN PRINCESS.

26
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,916
- ( gasps )
- MEOW!

27
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,666
- ( both exclaim )

28
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,666
- AH, SO THIS IS WHERE
THE PORTAL LEADS TO.

29
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,833
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

30
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,875
WASHU, YOU SCARED ME
HALF TO DEATH.

31
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,875
- HUH?  WELL, GOOD MORNING,
AYEKA.

32
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,375
I WORKED ALL NIGHT
TO PERFECT

33
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,833
THIS EXPERIMENT,
AND IT WAS WORTH IT.

34
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,833
MY INTERDIMENSIONAL TUNNEL
SUCCEEDED.

35
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,708
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,
I AM A SCIENTIFIC GENIUS, AYEKA.

36
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,750
( laughs )

37
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,208
- ( clanging )

38
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,791
- RISE AND SHINE, EVERYBODY.
GET UP.

39
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,083
IT'S ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL DAY,
CLEAR AND SUNNY

40
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,708
WITH TEMPERATURES
IN THE HIGH 70s TO LOW 80s.

41
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,416
- GOOD MORNING TO YOU, SASAMI.
- SASAMI, 'MORNING.

42
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,958
- MEOW.
- GOOD MORNING.

43
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,208
AT LEAST I'M NOT THE ONLY
ONE WHO GOT UP EARLY.

44
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,208
HOW ARE YOU, RYO-OHKI?

45
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,541
- MEOW, MEOW!
- ( giggles )

46
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,750
NOW WE HAVE TO WAKE UP
THE USELESS SLEEPYHEADS.

47
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,458
TENCHI, RYOKO, FATHER,

48
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,125
TIME TO GET OUT
OF BED!

49
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,708
- THANKS A LOT, SASAMI,

50
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,583
BUT I WAS UP BEFORE YOU
THIS MORNING.

51
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:19,833
( chuckles )
- Sasami: OH.

52
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,166
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I UNDERSTAND.

53
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,166
I DON'T MAKE MUCH
OF AN IMPRESSION, DO I?

54
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,541
- NOT REALLY.
- COME ON, TENCHI,

55
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,291
COME ON, RYOKO,
GET UP!

56
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,750
HUH?
- Ryoko: OH, THIS IS IT.

57
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,958
( sobbing )
I THINK I'M DYING.

58
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,708
OH, SOMEONE HELP ME,
PLEASE.

59
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,291
HUH?  WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU, RYOKO?

60
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,916
- I'M AFRAID
IT'S MY FAULT.

61
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,250
- ( moaning )

62
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,833
I'M GONNA THROW UP.

63
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,916
SASAMI, GET ME
SOME WATER.

64
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
- RYOKO HAD A LITTLE DRINK
OF MY HOMEMADE SAKE LAST NIGHT.

65
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,250
- Ryoko: I ONLY HAD
ONE SIP.

66
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,166
- THE BATCH MIGHT HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE STRONG.

67
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,916
- Ryoko: YEAH.
- ( all groaning )

68
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,500
- Ayeka: UGH, RYOKO,
GO BACK TO YOUR ROOM.

69
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,916
YOU SMELL LIKE
A BREWERY.

70
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,791
- Ryoko: I SHOULD.
I'M HUNG OVER.

71
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,791
- TENCHI, HOW MUCH LONGER
ARE YOU GONNA SLEEP?

72
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,416
I FOUND YOU.
- MEOW.

73
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,791
- WHAT?
- HUH?

74
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,166
- HE MUST HAVE GOT UP EARLY TOO.
BUT WHERE'D HE GO?

75
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,166
- ( birds twittering )

76
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:14,875
- HMM?

77
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,916
- ( inhales )

78
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,500
AHH.

79
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:33,000
- I'M GOING FOR MY BLACK BELT
IN BREAKFAST PREPARATION.

80
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,666
YAH!  YAH!

81
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,708
YAH! ( giggles )

82
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,166
- SASAMI, IT SOUNDS LIKE
20 PEOPLE IN HERE.

83
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,958
- HI, GOOD MORNING,
GRANDPA.

84
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,375
- I ADMIRE YOUR ENERGY.
COOKING FOR THREE MEN

85
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,791
AND SIX YOUNG LADIES
FROM OUTER SPACE

86
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,375
CAN'T BE AN EASY JOB.

87
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,208
- HMM?  IT'S ALL RIGHT.

88
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,791
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO
TO REPAY YOUR HOSPITALITY.

89
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,500
I MEAN, HERE WE'VE ALL
MOVED INTO YOUR HOUSE,

90
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,208
AND YOU'VE BEEN
THE PERFECT HOST.

91
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,166
- THAT'S THE BEST COMPLIMENT
I'VE EVER HAD.

92
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,708
IN MY OPINION,

93
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,958
SASAMI SHOULD BE
TENCHI'S BRIDE!

94
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,583
- DID YOU HEAR THAT, AYEKA?
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

95
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,666
I'M GETTING MARRIED
TO TENCHI.

96
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,750
- YOU CAN'T JUST GIVE HIM
TO SOMEBODY ELSE!

97
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,500
TENCHI AND I ARE MEANT TO BE
TOGETHER, DON'T YOU REMEMBER?!

98
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:13,666
( gasps )

99
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,666
MY, WHAT IN THE WORLD
HAS COME OVER ME?

100
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,166
I'VE NEVER BEEN
THIS AGGRESSIVE.

101
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,041
IT'S JUST-- WELL, IT'S JUST
THAT I FEEL A STRONG BOND

102
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,208
BETWEEN TENCHI AND THE PEOPLE
OF THE PLANET JURAI,

103
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,208
SOMETHING THAT TRANSCENDS
TIME AND SPACE.

104
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,958
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
THAT FEELING ORIGINATES,

105
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,541
BUT I KNOW IT'S MORE
THAN JUST FATE,

106
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,958
ESPECIALLY THE CONNECTION
BETWEEN TENCHI AND MYSELF.

107
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,083
I'M CONVINCED
WE'RE MEANT FOR EACH OTHER.

108
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,083
MM.

109
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,083
- ( chopsticks clicking )
- WOW, SASAMI,

110
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,166
I'M TOTALLY CONVINCED
YOU'RE A REALLY GOOD COOK.

111
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,458
- IT'LL BE IMPORTANT
WHEN I'M A BRIDE.

112
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:41,625
- OH, PLEASE.

113
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,333
- CAN I HAVE
SOME TEA, AYEKA?

114
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,458
- ALL RIGHT.

115
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:49,083
- ( siren wailing )

116
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,541
- ( screams )

117
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,166
- Mihoshi: STOP RIGHT THERE.
YOU'RE SPEEDING

118
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,000
AND CAUSING
A DANGEROUS SITUATION.

119
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,416
YOU'RE MAKING MY PARTNER KIYONE
REALLY ANGRY.

120
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,208
- ALL RIGHT, PULL OVER,
LEAD FOOT.

121
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:01,041
WE JUST CLOCKED YOU DOING
BETTER THAN 10,000 MILES AN HOUR

122
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,375
IN A 9,000 ZONE.

123
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,208
ARE YOU LISTENING?
WE'RE THE GALAXY POLICE

124
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,375
FOR THIS SECTOR.
LICENSE AND REGISTRATION.

125
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,583
( fires gun )

126
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,708
MIHOSHI, TRANSFER THAT PUNK
TO H.Q.

127
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:12,916
- READY TO TRANSFER.

128
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,583
- LET'S GO HOME
AND GET SOME BREAKFAST.

129
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,791
- THAT'S GONNA BE A PROBLEM.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

130
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,375
- WELL, WE'VE USED UP
ALL OUR FUEL.

131
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,583
- AH!  SURE IT ISN'T THE GAUGES?
- AFRAID NOT.

132
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,083
- WHAT WAS THAT?

133
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,625
- MIHOSHI AND KIYONE ARE BACK
FROM PATROL, NO BIG DEAL.

134
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,291
- THEY ALWAYS MAKE A BIG,
SPLASHY ENTRANCE.

135
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,500
- TV anchor: CONTINUING OUR
TOP LOCAL STORY,

136
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,291
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
REPORTED SEEING

137
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,166
A SERIES OF BRIGHT,
GLOWING OBJECTS

138
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,333
IN THE SKIES OVER TOKYO
LAST NIGHT.

139
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,250
AT THE PRESENT TIME, THESE
OBJECTS REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED.

140
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,750
- Tenchi: I WONDER
IF WE HAVE MORE VISITORS.

141
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,458
- TRUST ME, THE ONES WE HAVE
ARE DISTRACTING ENOUGH.

142
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:46,750
- HUH?
- TENCHI...

143
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,250
- UM...
- YOU CAN SAY NO IF YOU LIKE.

144
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,416
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT MY INTENTION
TO FORCE YOU.

145
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,250
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

146
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,375
I'VE ALREADY MADE UP
MY MIND.

147
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,833
- VERY WELL.
SHALL I ANNOUNCE IT?

148
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,833
- I'D BETTER TELL THEM
MYSELF.

149
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,708
- TIME FOR
A GROUP PHOTO.

150
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,541
TA-DAH!
IT'S MY NEW INVENTION.

151
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,666
THIS CAMERA TAKES PICTURES
IN 3D.

152
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,125
- IS THAT
THE PORTABLE MODEL?

153
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,916
WHY ARE WE TAKING
THESE PICTURES ANYWAY?

154
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,875
- 'CAUSE I LIKE
TAKING PICTURES.

155
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,125
- SORRY, I WAS THE ONE
WHO WANTED THE PHOTO.

156
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,583
- YOU?  WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

157
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,291
- HANG ON,
WHERE'S RYOKO?

158
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,791
- SHE'S IN BED
WITH A HANGOVER.

159
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,958
- Sasami: SHE WON'T BE
GETTING UP FOR A WHILE.

160
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,875
- I HAVE ONE QUESTION, WASHU--
YOU SURE THAT THING'S A CAMERA?

161
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,625
- OH, YEAH.
IT'S A HOLOGRAM CAMERA

162
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,875
THAT USES A VERY POWERFUL
LASER BEAM.

163
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,541
I'LL DEMONSTRATE
HOW IT WORKS.

164
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,458
YEAH!
- MEOW!

165
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,791
- IS EVERYONE READY?
NOW SMILE!

166
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,083
- ( camera whirring )

167
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,458
- ( all cheer, laugh )

168
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,166
- THANKS SO MUCH,
EVERYBODY.

169
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,666
- I DON'T MEAN
TO BE PUSHY, TENCHI,

170
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,250
BUT WHY DID YOU WANT
TO TAKE OUR PICTURE?

171
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,208
- IT'S NOT ANYBODY'S
BIRTHDAY TODAY, IS IT?

172
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,583
- SIT DOWN, FOLKS.
I GOT SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.

173
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,083
- ( wind whistling )

174
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,208
- Girls: WHAT?

175
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,750
- YOU'RE LEAVING
ALL OF US?

176
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,083
- TO GO TO SCHOOL
IN TOKYO?

177
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,041
- YEAH, TOMORROW MORNING.

178
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,666
- TOMORROW?
YOUR MIND'S MADE UP?

179
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,833
- I'M YOUR FATHER, AND YOU
DIDN'T TELL ME ABOUT THIS?

180
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,500
I HAD NO IDEA.

181
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,500
- SORRY, DAD.
GRANDPA KNEW ABOUT IT.

182
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,416
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
DESERTING ME TO GO SO FAR AWAY.

183
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,958
HOW LONG WILL YOU BE GONE,
TENCHI?

184
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,166
- I GUESS,
OH, ABOUT TWO YEARS.

185
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,166
- TWO YEARS?
- WHAT HAPPENED, TENCHI?

186
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,708
DON'T YOU LIKE ME ANYMORE?
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE GOING AWAY?

187
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,166
- SASAMI, DON'T BLAME
YOURSELF.

188
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,041
I LOVE ALL OF YOU.
THAT'S NOT THE REASON.

189
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,000
- HOW COME YOU'RE LEAVING?
TELL ME WHY, TENCHI.

190
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,916
- I CAN EXPLAIN, SASAMI.

191
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,666
LAST WEEK
I WENT TO TOKYO

192
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,166
TO TAKE CARE
OF A LITTLE BUSINESS,

193
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,791
WHEN I MET
DOKUZEN TSUCHIDA,

194
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,708
THE LOCAL
SHINTO HEAD PRIEST.

195
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,250
WE SPOKE AND HE ASKED ME
TO CONVINCE TENCHI

196
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,583
TO SERVE AN APPRENTICESHIP
UNDER HIM,

197
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:42,208
SO HE WOULD BECOME A BETTER
GUARDIAN OF THE MASAKI SHRINE.

198
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,833
- YOU COULDN'T REFUSE
HIS REQUEST?

199
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,875
- I MEAN, REALLY.
- THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,

200
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,708
PRIEST TSUCHIDA'S ANCESTORS
WERE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

201
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,625
TO THE ESTABLISHMENT
OF THE MASAKI SHRINE,

202
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,208
SO I COULDN'T VERY WELL
TURN HIM DOWN.

203
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,291
- RIGHT.  I AGREE.
I DIDN'T REALIZE

204
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,833
THERE WAS A MATTER OF HONOR
INVOLVED IN THIS.

205
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,250
- WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO
WITHOUT TENCHI AROUND?

206
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,958
- WE'VE BEEN ASSIGNED TO EARTH
MAINLY BECAUSE OF TENCHI,

207
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,791
TO STAY NEAR HIM
AND TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.

208
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,833
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO CARRY OUT
OUR MISSION IF HE GOES TO TOKYO?

209
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,291
- WE SHOULD SEND FATHER.
- MEOW, MEOW, MEOW.

210
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,666
- WHY ME?

211
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,583
- YOU WERE THE CARETAKER
OF THE SHRINE BEFORE TENCHI.

212
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:16,041
I KNOW HOW TO GET YOU
TO TOKYO!

213
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:19,750
- MEOW, MEOW!

214
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,166
- ( screaming )

215
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,625
- GOODBYE NOW.
WE'LL SEE YOU LATER.

216
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:25,875
- STOP ALL THIS.

217
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,958
- MEOW!
- ( screams )

218
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,666
- YOU CAN'T CHANGE MY MIND.
I'M GOING TO TOKYO.

219
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,166
- I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GO, TENCHI.

220
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,833
CAN'T YOU STAY
WITH US?

221
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,083
- THAT'S ENOUGH NOW.

222
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,125
IT'S NOT OUR PLACE TO INTERFERE
WITH HIS WISHES.

223
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,541
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

224
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,916
- MAYBE SO, BUT DON'T WE
AT LEAST GET TO VOTE ON IT?

225
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,875
- PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT
TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS.

226
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,875
WE'VE BEEN MAKING
A LOT OF DEMANDS ON TENCHI.

227
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,250
WE SHOULD RESPECT HIS NEED
TO BE INDEPENDENT.

228
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,541
- YEAH.

229
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,000
- THANK YOU
FOR BEING SUPPORTIVE.

230
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,541
- I KNOW THIS MEANS
A LOT TO YOU.

231
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:52,833
GOOD LUCK
WITH YOUR TRAINING.

232
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,958
- TENCHI,

233
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,833
I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH.

234
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,125
- MEOW!

235
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,958
MEOW!

236
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,041
- ( all grunting )

237
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,500
- Girl: HEY THERE.
WAIT UP.

238
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,083
- HEY.

239
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,041
- ( students giggling )

240
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,208
- Katsuhito: TAXI!

241
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,583
( grunting )

242
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,000
- ( all chattering )

243
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,333
- ( sighing )

244
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,833
- BYE.

245
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,375
- CALL ME LATER.
I'LL BE AROUND.  BYE.

246
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,250
- THE PRIEST WAS ABLE
TO GET YOU

247
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,083
A VERY NICE PLACE,
FROM THE LOOKS OF IT.

248
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,708
- IT SHOULD BE FINE.
WE'D BETTER GET GOING, GRANDPA.

249
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:07,000
- TO WHERE?
- TO VISIT THIS MR. BUSYBODY.

250
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,458
- ( horns honking )

251
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,791
- ( people chattering )

252
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,458
( laughs )

253
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,208
WELCOME TO TOKYO, TENCHI.

254
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,500
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT A THING.

255
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,041
I'LL START TRAINING YOU
IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

256
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,166
WHY, YOU'LL MAKE AN EXCELLENT
PRIEST, WITH A LITTLE HELP.

257
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,875
- THANKS, SIR.
I'LL BE COUNTING ON YOU.

258
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,875
- THE BOY'S ALWAYS HAD
A LOT OF SPIRIT.

259
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,375
- MM-HMM.

260
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,708
NOW I'M SORRY TO IMPOSE
ON OUR RELATIONSHIP,

261
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,125
BUT COULD YOU HELP ME OUT
AND PERFORM A PURIFYING RITUAL

262
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,833
ON A LOCAL BUILDING
CONSTRUCTION SITE?

263
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,041
TO SOOTHE THE
SPIRIT ON THE SITE.

264
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,125
YEAH, I'D BE GLAD
TO DO IT MYSELF,

265
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,291
BUT SOMETHING LAST-MINUTE
HAS COME UP.  OKAY?

266
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,875
- YOU HONOR ME
WITH YOUR TRUST.

267
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,666
I'LL DO THE CEREMONY
IN THE AFTERNOON,

268
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,041
THEN I'LL GO
BACK HOME.

269
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,791
- OH, I'M INDEBTED
TO YOU.

270
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,666
IT'S A HUGE RELIEF.
THANKS A LOT.

271
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,083
- HOW ABOUT GIVING ME
A HAND, TENCHI?

272
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,083
- SURE.

273
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,875
- ( frogs croaking )

274
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,833
- WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING
FOR DINNER TONIGHT, SASAMI?

275
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,833
- OHH.
- WHAT'S WRONG?

276
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,750
- EVER SINCE TENCHI LEFT,
SHE'S BEEN DEPRESSED.

277
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,250
SHE ISN'T MOTIVATED
TO DO ANYTHING.

278
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,333
- BUT WHAT ABOUT DINNER?
- FORGET IT.

279
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,500
- HUH?
- ( girls slurping )

280
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,333
- OH, YOU FOUND
SOME INSTANT SOUP.

281
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,666
YOU HAVE ANY MORE
OF THOSE?

282
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,416
- YEAH, AND THEY'RE
A VERY GOOD DEAL TOO.

283
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,750
- RIGHT, THEY'RE AVAILABLE
FOR JUST 500 YEN.

284
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,791
- 500 YEN?

285
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,125
- TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.

286
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,791
- I'LL HAVE ONE.
- THANK YOU.

287
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,666
- YOU'RE A GOOD SALESPERSON.
- ( grunting )

288
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,583
I HAVE NO CHOICE.

289
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,166
- I'LL BUY ONE OF THEM.

290
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,250
- HERE YOU GO.
- ( chuckles )

291
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,583
- I WANT ONE.
- SORRY, WE'RE SOLD OUT.

292
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,750
- ARGH!  WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

293
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,250
- MEOW.
- Kiyone: SAVE YOUR MONEY.

294
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,500
BREAKFAST IS GONNA
COST A FORTUNE.

295
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,375
- DON'T FORGET, WE HAVE TO
GET UP EARLY TOMORROW.

296
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,500
- I KNOW.

297
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,166
- ( laughing )

298
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,000
TENCHI MASAKI.

299
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,458
- ( clears throat )

300
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,958
SPIRITS BE PURIFIED.
SPIRITS BE ENSHRINED...

301
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,875
- I HEAR THIS SITE HAS BEEN
VACANT FOR 50 YEARS.

302
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,041
- THEY SAY THIS PLACE WAS
HAUNTED BY EVIL SPIRITS.

303
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:33,458
- ...SO THEY CAN FIND
PEACE.

304
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,708
- ( laughing )

305
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,666
- ( all exclaiming )

306
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,916
- OOH-HOO-HOO-HOO-HOO!
WELL, WELL, DO YOU REALLY THINK

307
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,583
YOU CAN CALM
THIS LOST SPIRIT?

308
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,750
ARE YOU STRONG ENOUGH
TO PURIFY ME?

309
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,166
( giggles )

310
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,708
LET ME TELL YOU, OLD MAN,
YOU HAVEN'T GOT A CHANCE.

311
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,125
- Tenchi: WHAT IS
THAT THING?

312
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,916
- Katsuhito: IT'S THE SPIRIT
GUARDING THIS SITE.

313
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,166
- WELL, HOW SMART OF YOU.

314
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,666
BUT YOU'VE MADE
ONE SMALL MISTAKE.

315
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,666
- THERE'S MORE THAN ONE OF US
LIVING HERE

316
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,083
AND WE'RE NOT GIVING UP
THE PROPERTY

317
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,666
JUST BECAUSE OF YOUR
MUMBO-JUMBO.

318
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,916
- ( both exclaim )
- ( spirit screaming )

319
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,375
- WELL, MY BOY, LOOKS LIKE
WE WOKE UP ALL THE SPIRITS

320
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,708
WHO EVER INHABITED THIS SITE
DOWN THROUGH THE AGES.

321
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:15,875
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

322
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,375
- ( spirits laughing,
yelling )

323
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,708
- STAND BACK.

324
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,416
I'VE MADE THESE KIND
OF SPIRITS DISAPPEAR BEFORE.

325
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,250
HEAR ME, O WANDERING ONES!
MAY THE GUARDS BE WITH ME

326
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,208
TO PURIFY YOUR
MISGUIDED SOULS

327
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:29,416
AND KEEP YOU FROM DOING HARM
TO YOURSELVES OR OTHERS.

328
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:41,333
IT'S QUITE POWERFUL.
IT'S A SPELL PASSED DOWN

329
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:44,041
FROM ONE GENERATION OF MASAKI
CARETAKERS TO THE NEXT.

330
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,166
YOU'LL HAVE TO LEARN IT YOURSELF
BEFORE TOO LONG.

331
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,708
- DID YOU FORGET
SOMETHING?

332
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,000
- NO.  WHY DO YOU ASK?

333
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,583
( screams )

334
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,833
- ( laughs ) OH, YOU'RE REALLY
QUITE INCOMPETENT, YOU KNOW.

335
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,916
YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO DIE!

336
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,375
- WHAT ARE YOU TRAINED
TO DO NOW?

337
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,291
- I BELIEVE I'M SUPPOSED
TO RUN!

338
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,416
- ( both panting,
whimpering )

339
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,166
- DON'T YOU HAVE ANY SPELLS
THAT WILL HELP US?

340
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,250
- YES, IT'S SPELLED "AYEKA."
I'M SO STUPID.

341
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,125
I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT HER ALONG
FOR PROTECTION.

342
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,125
- Ryoko: WHAT DID YOU SAY?

343
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,583
YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOU LET TENCHI

344
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:26,583
MOVE OUT OF THE HOUSE AND GO
TO TOKYO WHILE I WAS ASLEEP?

345
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:27,916
( growls )
- ( all moaning )

346
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,083
- AND YOU--
YOU'RE TELLING ME

347
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,916
YOU DIDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?

348
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,083
- HE KEPT IT
A SECRET.

349
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,583
ARGH!
- AYEKA, YOU TIMED THIS OUT

350
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:36,958
SO HE'D LEAVE
WHILE I WAS ASLEEP.

351
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,666
- AS I RECALL,
I WASN'T THE ONE

352
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,458
WHO PASSED OUT COLD
FROM TOO MUCH SAKE.

353
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,250
- ( gasps )

354
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,125
WASHU GAVE ME
THAT DRINK.

355
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,083
ARGH!  WASHU!

356
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,541
THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED
IF YOU HADN'T GOT ME PLASTERED.

357
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,458
- ALL RIGHT,
CALM DOWN, RYOKO.

358
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,666
I'LL TAKE YOU TO TENCHI THROUGH
MY INTERDIMENSIONAL TUNNEL.

359
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,000
- GOOD.  I'M COMING
WITH YOU.

360
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,041
- MEOW.

361
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,958
- I'D LIKE
TO COME ALONG TOO.

362
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,250
- I MIGHT AS WELL
JOIN YOU.

363
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,958
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S ALL
GO VISIT HIM TOGETHER.

364
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,916
- ( whimpering )

365
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,208
- ( laughs )

366
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,916
PREPARE TO DIE!

367
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,041
- Tenchi: HUH?

368
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,541
- TENCHI!

369
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,166
- RYOKO.

370
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,583
- TENCHI, I MISSED YOU
SO MUCH.

371
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,125
- EVERYONE?

372
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,000
- WE CAME TO VISIT.
ARE YOU SURPRISED?

373
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,541
- THEY ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED
THAT I BRING THEM HERE.

374
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,083
- HOW HAVE YOU BEEN
DOING?

375
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,458
- ENJOYING YOURSELF?

376
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,541
- WE'RE AWFULLY SORRY
TO BARGE IN LIKE THIS,

377
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,875
BUT WE ALL WANTED
TO CHECK UP ON YOU.

378
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,083
- ( giggling )
NO PROBLEM.

379
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,625
WE WERE JUST THINKING
ABOUT YOU GUYS.

380
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,958
YOUR TIMING'S PERFECT.
RIGHT, GRANDPA?

381
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,041
- YOU SEE
THESE MONSTERS HERE?

382
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,583
WELL, WE'VE BEEN HAVING QUITE
A DISAGREEMENT WITH THEM.

383
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,333
THEY SAY WE'RE INCOMPETENT
BUSYBODIES.

384
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,166
IN FACT,
WHEN EVERYBODY ARRIVED,

385
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,791
THEY WERE GOING
TO KILL US.

386
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,000
- WHAT?
- THEY'RE THREATENING TO...

387
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,458
- KILL YOU?
- MEOW.

388
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,208
( laughs )

389
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,958
IT'S NOT JUST A THREAT.
WE'RE GOING TO DO IT.

390
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,416
- ( all grunt )
- ( cocks gun )

391
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,583
- YEAH.
- ( laughs ) OH, MY.

392
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,375
YOU SCARED ME
FOR A SECOND...

393
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,375
NOT!

394
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:10,625
( squeaks )

395
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:11,875
- ( spirits scream )

396
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,375
- YOU THINK
YOU CAN HANDLE ME?

397
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,333
YOU SHOULD NEVER
CHALLENGE SOMEONE

398
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,166
UNLESS YOU KNOW
YOU CAN BEAT THEM.

399
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:20,875
- ( screaming )

400
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,541
- ( Tenchi and Katsuhito
whimpering )

401
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,000
- ( grunts ) HUH?

402
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,000
- TENCHI SHALL NOT BE
HARMED,

403
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,583
NO MATTER
WHAT YOU FOUR DO.

404
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,000
- GO, RYO-OHKI!

405
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,083
- MEOW!  MEOW!

406
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,041
- ( grunts )

407
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,250
LET'S GET 'EM,
RYO-OHKI.

408
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,666
- ( meowing )
- ( spirit grunting )

409
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,708
- MEOW, MEOW.

410
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,583
MEOW, MEOW, MEOW,
MEOW, MEOW!

411
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,083
MEOW!
- THE WINNER.

412
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,625
- I BET THEY CAN'T HOLD
THEIR LIQUOR HERE.

413
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,333
HAVE A TASTE
OF MY SAKE.

414
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:54,791
- I'LL POUR IT
FOR YOU.

415
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,583
NEED A BIGGER GUN.

416
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,791
- MOVE.

417
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,000
YOU'RE GOING BACK
TO THE PRACTICE RANGE.

418
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,250
- OH.

419
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,666
- ( groaning )

420
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,125
( screaming )

421
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,291
- ( coins ding )

422
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,166
- LOOK, GRANDPA.

423
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,250
- OH, APPARENTLY THEY WERE
OBSESSED WITH MONEY,

424
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,666
WHICH MEANS ALL FOUR OF THEM
WERE SPIRITS OF GREED.

425
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,375
- YOU TAKE GOOD CARE
OF YOURSELF.

426
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,833
- Sasami: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE
A WELL-BALANCED DIET, OKAY?

427
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,166
- I WILL.

428
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,541
- IT'S VERY HARD FOR ME
TO BE SEPARATED FROM YOU,

429
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,041
BUT THANK GOODNESS
WE NOW HAVE

430
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,416
THIS INTERDIMENSIONAL TUNNEL
WASHU INVENTED.

431
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,958
I CAN VISIT
MORE EASILY.

432
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,875
- YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO'LL BE VISITING TENCHI.

433
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,333
I'M PLANNING SOME LATE-NIGHT
VISITS OF MY OWN

434
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,708
THROUGH THAT
TUNNEL OF LOVE.

435
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,375
( giggles )

436
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,708
( groaning )

437
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,458
- YOU'RE NOT COMING TO VISIT
WITHOUT A CHAPERONE.

438
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,833
- I'LL BE BACK TO SEE YOU
AS SOON AS I ESCAPE

439
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,791
FROM THIS WICKED WITCH
OF THE WEST.

440
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,666
SO REMEMBER, DON'T SIT
UNDER THE APPLE TREE

441
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,458
WITH ANYONE ELSE
BUT ME.

442
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,458
( groaning )

443
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:00,250
- BYE, TENCHI.
SEE YOU LATER.

444
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,333
- OKAY.

445
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,666
SO MUCH FOR THAT.

446
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,583
I CAN'T WAIT
TO CHECK OUT MY SCHOOL.

447
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,916
THE FIRST DAY OF MY NEW LIFE
BEGINS TOMORROW.

448
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,083
- ( birds chirping )

449
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,750
- HI.  MY NAME IS
TENCHI MASAKI.

450
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,125
- Man: LET'S GIVE
A WARM WELCOME

451
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,125
TO OUR NEW TRANSFER STUDENT.
- ( students jeering )

452
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,833
- FIND YOURSELF
AN EMPTY SEAT, TENCHI.

453
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,416
THE SEATING ARRANGEMENT IN HERE
IS FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED.

454
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,833
- YES, SIR.

455
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,000
- WE'LL BE STARTING OUR LESSON
IN JUST A FEW MINUTES.

456
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,166
- THIS IS GOOD.

457
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,666
GOOD MORNING.

458
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,291
- HI THERE.
MY NAME IS SAKUYA.

459
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,041
I THINK WE'RE GONNA BE
GOOD FRIENDS.

460
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,000
YOU'RE KIND OF CUTE.
- UH...

461
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,750
- ( Yugi laughing )

462
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,583
- ( upbeat song playing )

463
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:04,833
( song finishes )
- MEOW.

464
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,750
MEOW.  MEOW.

465
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,416
MEOW.

466
