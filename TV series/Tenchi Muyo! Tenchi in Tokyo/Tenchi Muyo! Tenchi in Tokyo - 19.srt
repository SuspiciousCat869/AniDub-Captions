1
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,458
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:04,333
- ( dings )

4
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:11,333
- I SEE THE SHIBUYA AREA.

5
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:12,958
BOY, IT LOOKS TINY
FROM UP HERE.

6
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,208
- HUH?

7
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,666
RYOKO.

8
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,375
( sighs )

9
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,041
- YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU JUST SAW A GHOST.

10
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,208
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

11
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,458
- NOTHING.

12
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:27,458
I'M FINE, REALLY.

13
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,000
- All: MMM.

14
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:39,375
- THE HOUSE SEEMS SO EMPTY
WITH EVERYBODY GONE.

15
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,041
I MISS KIYONE AND MIHOSHI.

16
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,541
THIS MIGHT SOUND ODD,
BUT I MISS RYOKO TOO.

17
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,250
- HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

18
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,666
I DON'T MISS HER A BIT.

19
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,375
IN FACT,
I'M EXTREMELY HAPPY

20
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,166
THAT THAT BARBARIAN
IS OUT OF MY FACE.

21
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,458
I WON'T GIVE HER
ANOTHER THOUGHT.

22
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,333
Ayeka: ( panting )

23
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,083
( gasps )

24
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,625
HMM.
( panting )

25
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,375
OH!

26
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,416
RYOKO?

27
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,250
OH?

28
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,750
( gasps )

29
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,833
WASHU?

30
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,208
KIYONE AND MIHOSHI TOO?

31
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,250
HUH?

32
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,250
SASAMI.

33
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,750
RYO-OHKI?

34
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,291
- Yugi: ( laughs )

35
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,791
( laughing )

36
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,458
- ( gasps )

37
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,375
OH!

38
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,125
( groans )

39
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,625
- ( laughs )

40
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,291
- ( screams )

41
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,875
( gasps )

42
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,541
WHAT A DREAM.

43
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,666
IT SEEMED SO
DISTURBINGLY REAL.

44
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,791
WHY CAN'T I SHAKE IT OFF?

45
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,208
I HAVE THIS UNEASY FEELING

46
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,458
THAT SOMETHING AWFUL
IS GOING TO HAPPEN. 

47
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,333
- Tsugaru:
PEACEFUL NIGHT, ISN'T IT?

48
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,291
- ( gasps )

49
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,375
- HI, PRINCESS.
WE MEET AGAIN. 

50
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,458
SURPRISED, AREN'T YOU?

51
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,375
- YES, YOU SCARED ME.

52
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:30,791
- IT'S QUIET.

53
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,125
ALMOST FEELS LIKE
THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM.

54
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,333
BETTER WATCH OUT.
DREAMS CAN COME TRUE.

55
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:36,291
- WHAT?

56
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,666
Ayeka: WAS MY DREAM
A PREMONITION?

57
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,500
- I HAVE TO GO NOW.

58
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,166
BUT I'LL SEE YOU
AROUND SOMETIME.

59
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,375
COUNT ON IT.
TAKE CARE.

60
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:48,500
- PLEASE WAIT UP.

61
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,708
YOU NEVER TOLD ME YOUR NAME.

62
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,916
WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,541
WHY ARE YOU WARNING ME?

64
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,458
- I'M TERRIBLY SORRY,
BUT I CAN'T REVEAL

65
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,041
ANY OF THAT INFORMATION...
JUST YET.

66
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,250
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS MUCH
SINCE YOU'RE ASKING.

67
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,083
I'M HERE ON
SOMEBODY'S ORDERS.

68
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,375
- SOMEONE SENT YOU?

69
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:03,791
- YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

70
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,541
SOMEONE WHO IS EXTREMELY
CONCERNED WITH YOUR WELL BEING.

71
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,000
GOTTA BE ON MY WAY.

72
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,041
- HEY, PLEASE DON'T GO.

73
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,291
WAIT UP.

74
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,791
I NEVER FOUND OUT
WHO SENT HIM.

75
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,375
WHO COULD HE BE
WORKING FOR ANYWAY?

76
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:22,875
- Azaka:
PRINCESS AYEKA?

77
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,416
HOW COME YOU'RE
STAYING UP SO LATE?

78
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,083
- HAVING A HARD TIME
FALLING ASLEEP?

79
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,875
- AZAKA AND KAMIDAKE,

80
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,083
I HAVE JUST MET...

81
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,208
- WHO?
- OH, NEVER MIND.

82
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,666
I CAN'T TELL ANYBODY BECAUSE

83
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,416
I DON'T KNOW WHO I'M
TALKING ABOUT.

84
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:46,000
- Sakuya: HOW DID YOU DO
ON THE EXAM, TENCHI?

85
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,583
- Tenchi:
I'M SURE I DID ALL RIGHT.

86
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:48,916
- THAT'S GOOD.

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,916
I'M REALLY AFRAID
I BLEW IT.

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,541
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

89
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,458
YOU LOOKED LIKE YOU WERE
DOING JUST FINE.

90
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,250
- WELL, I FOOLED YOU.

91
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,750
TENCHI, DID YOU FIND
STUDYING AT HOME

92
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,083
ANY EASIER FOR YOU?

93
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,791
- HUH? AT OKAYAMA--

94
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,333
- Both: DON'T YOU DARE
TALK TO TENCHI.  IT'S MY TURN!

95
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,250
- UH...
- IS ANYTHING WRONG?

96
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,250
- HUH?

97
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,666
- UH-HUH.

98
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,583
- ( chuckles )

99
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,083
- THAT LAUGH SOUNDS
WAY TOO PHONY.

100
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,250
YOU SHOULD LIGHTEN UP, BRO.
- DON'T BE GLUM.

101
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,916
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW LUCKY YOU ARE

102
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,458
TO HAVE SUCH A CUTE
GIRLFRIEND?

103
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,500
- WHY DO YOU THINK I'M GLUM?
WHY ARE YOU SAYING THAT?

104
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:22,750
- I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

105
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,416
BECAUSE I BELIEVE
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT

106
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,458
SOME GIRL BACK IN OKAYAMA.
AM I RIGHT?

107
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,458
- OH.

108
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,125
- WHAT?  NO WAY, MAN.

109
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,791
- COME ON, TENCHI.
FESS UP.

110
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,125
OR I'LL HAVE TO
GIVE YOU A MELVIN,

111
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,625
MY NEWEST WRESTLING HOLD.

112
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,625
- KNOCK IT OFF, GUYS.
QUIT EMBARRASSING ME.

113
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:36,833
- ( giggles )

114
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,166
YOU HAVE SO MUCH FUN
TEASING EACH OTHER. 

115
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,291
YOU MUST BE
BEST FRIENDS.

116
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,375
- ( chuckles )

117
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,458
YEAH, WE ARE.

118
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:45,500
- WE GET ALONG SO WELL

119
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:46,916
BECAUSE WE'RE SO SIMILAR.

120
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,291
- I AM NOT LIKE THEM AT ALL.

121
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,583
- THAT'S IT!

122
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,625
THERE'S BEEN TOO MANY
CHANGES AROUND HERE. 

123
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:52,958
- Both: HUH?
- ( meows )

124
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,916
- I DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D NOTICED.

125
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,291
BUT YOU SEE THEY WERE ALL
OUT OF OUR REGULAR MISO PASTE,

126
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,250
SO I HAD TO BUY
A DIFFERENT KIND.  SORRY.

127
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,458
- THAT IS NOT WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT!

128
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:04,291
- OH.  IS IT THE SPINACH
THAT BOTHERS YOU?

129
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,833
THE ORGANIC VEGETABLE MART
WAS CLOSED TODAY

130
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,833
SO I HAD TO SHOP AT
A REGULAR MARKET.

131
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,500
THEIR PRODUCE
DIDN'T LOOK TOO FRESH,

132
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:11,500
BUT THAT'S NOT MY FAULT.

133
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,958
- IT'S NOT THE SPINACH.

134
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,291
- I KNOW.
IT'S THE PAN-FRIED POTATOES

135
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,666
BEING KIND OF DRIED UP.

136
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,333
I WAS READING
A COMIC BOOK,

137
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,208
AND THE NEXT THING
YOU KNOW, I SMELLED SMOKE.

138
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,666
I GUESS THEY GOT
A LITTLE BIT BURNED.

139
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,000
- I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
THE LOUSY FOOD!

140
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,000
OUR HOME HAS BEEN
CHANGED TOO MUCH.

141
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,333
WAY TOO MUCH.
I MEAN IT, LOOK AROUND!

142
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,333
I'M TALKING ABOUT
OUR CURRENT SITUATION.

143
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:35,500
- THE PRINCESS SEEMS TO BE
TOO TIGHTLY WOUND TODAY.

144
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:38,333
- SOUNDS TO ME LIKE SHE
COULD USE SOME MUSCLE RELAXANT.

145
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,541
- ( meows )

146
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,250
- WHAT SITUATION
DO YOU MEAN?

147
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,583
- RYOKO IS MISSING,

148
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:45,000
AND WE DON'T HAVE A CLUE
TO WHERE SHE IS.

149
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:49,583
MIHOSHI AND KIYONE WERE CALLED
BACK TO THEIR 62nd PRECINCT.

150
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,833
AND WASHU HAS BEEN
SHUT UP IN THE LABORATORY.

151
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,250
SHE HASN'T COME OUT
FOR AGES.

152
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,708
NOW DO YOU SEE MY POINT?

153
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:58,875
OVERCOOKED SPINACH

154
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,708
AND BURNT PAN-FRIED POTATOES?

155
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,000
OH!  ISN'T ANYONE
PAYING ATTENTION?

156
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,000
TENCHI USED TO BE THE BOND
THAT KEPT US ALL TOGETHER,

157
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,791
BUT LATELY EVERYONE
HAS LEFT TO GO OFF 

158
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,458
TO DO WHATEVER IT IS THEY DO.

159
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:10,541
SOMETHING AWFUL WILL HAPPEN

160
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,625
UNLESS WE ALL GET
TOGETHER AGAIN.

161
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,041
AS YOU KNOW,
I'M THE JURAI CROWN PRINCESS.

162
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,250
I HAVE THE POWER
TO SENSE THAT DANGER

163
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,250
IS LOOMING OUT THERE.

164
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,375
- I THINK AYEKA'S
BEING PARANOID.

165
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,375
- ( meows )

166
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,708
- ( chuckles )

167
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,750
- OH...

168
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,416
( clears throat )

169
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,291
I NEED TO BRING
EVERYONE BACK, 

170
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,750
BUT I'M NOT SURE
HOW TO BEGIN.

171
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,416
I CAN'T REACH RYOKO.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE WENT.

172
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,958
AND MIHOSHI AND KIYONE'S
PRECINCT IS NEAR PLUTO, 

173
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,291
WHICH IS FAR AWAY.

174
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,291
I CAN'T EXACTLY GO
KNOCKING ON THEIR DOOR.

175
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,916
( gasps )

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,875
WASHU, OPEN UP!

177
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:55,583
WASHU,
OPEN THIS DOOR AT ONCE!

178
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,916
LOOKS LIKE I'M GOING TO
HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER WAY.

179
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,083
HAND ME A MALLET NOW,
AZAKA.

180
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,291
- YES, PRINCESS.

181
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,500
- ( shouts )

182
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,750
( grunting )

183
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,458
A BIGGER MALLET.

184
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:14,500
- YES, PRINCESS.

185
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,791
- ( strains )

186
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,791
AAH!

187
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,041
( grunts )

188
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,791
HAND ME A SAW.

189
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,625
- YES, PRINCESS.

190
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:30,791
- THE DRILL MONSTER!

191
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,000
- YES, PRINCESS.

192
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,875
- AAH!

193
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,333
THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY LEFT.

194
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,791
I KNOW IT IS DANGEROUS,
BUT SHE LEAVES ME NO CHOICE.

195
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,458
- OH, NO.
NOT THAT, PLEASE.

196
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,208
- WON'T YOU RECONSIDER,
PRINCESS?

197
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,333
- THAT IS AN ORDER.

198
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,041
- Both: YES, PRINCESS.

199
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,250
- ( gasps )

200
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:53,583
- All: THE JURAI SUPER SUPREME
TOTAL ANNIHILATION BEAM.

201
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,833
- ( explosion )

202
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,500
- UH...

203
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,166
- OHH.

204
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,875
- ( meows )

205
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,166
- ( groans )

206
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,833
WHY WON'T YOU COME OUT?

207
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,250
( coughs )

208
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:21,833
- ( chuckles )

209
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,166
- OH.

210
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,166
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING HERE
THAT I HAVEN'T USED YET.

211
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,666
ALL RIGHT.

212
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,958
I'LL NEVER GIVE UP.
I'M DETERMINED.

213
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,833
I WILL FIND A WAY TO BRING
EVERYONE BACK TOGETHER.

214
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,416
- ( snoring meows )

215
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,833
- HMM.

216
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,333
MY TRAVEL TICKET.

217
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,041
- ( floor creaks )

218
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,208
- HMM?

219
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,291
( meows )

220
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,958
- DID YOU HAVE
A NICE SLEEP, DEAR?

221
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,291
I HOPE SO,
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT!

222
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,916
- ( meows )

223
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,666
( meows )

224
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,208
- ( meows )

225
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,041
- ( laughs )

226
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,416
LET THEM SEND THE WHOLE
GALAXY POLICE FLEET.

227
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,916
THEY'LL BE NO MATCH FOR ME.

228
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,208
- THEY'RE COMING.

229
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,750
- ( chuckles )

230
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:23,916
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

231
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,833
HEY, YOU MADE MY DAY!

232
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,250
- AND YOU'VE MADE MINE.

233
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:55,416
- HUH?

234
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,583
- NICE TO SEE YOU STILL
HAVE THAT MAGIC.

235
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,833
YOU'RE MAGNIFICENT.

236
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,291
- STOP.

237
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,625
I MIGHT THINK YOU MEAN IT.

238
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:03,958
- BUT I DO, RYOKO.

239
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,833
- Gyan: BATTLE STATIONS.
- HUH?

240
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,791
- Gyan: ENEMY AT TEN O'CLOCK
ON A 30 DEGREE ELEVATION.

241
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,041
DETECTING MULTIPLE OBJECTS
COMING OUT OF WARP

242
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,958
AND FAST APPROACHING
OUR SECTOR.

243
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,291
- CHANGE COURSE.
LET'S GO GET THEM.

244
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,166
- ROGER THAT.

245
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,833
- THEY DON'T GET IT.

246
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,125
THEY JUST KEEP
COMING AT ME. 

247
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,458
YOU WON'T EVER CATCH ME.

248
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,041
HAVEN'T YOU FIGURED
THAT OUT YET?

249
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,375
- ( chuckles )

250
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,500
HMM.

251
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:28,958
( chuckles )

252
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,625
- ( laughs )

253
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,291
- Sasami: RYO-OHKI?

254
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,041
RYO-OHKI?

255
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,125
I WONDER WHERE
SHE COULD HAVE GONE TO.

256
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,166
I WANTED HER TO GO

257
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,000
OFF TO THE VEGETABLE
MARKET WITH ME.

258
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,666
( sighs )

259
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,875
- ( meows )

260
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,541
- FULL SPEED, RYO-OHKI.

261
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,833
OUR DESTINATION IS
THE 62nd PRECINCT.

262
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:52,833
- ( meows )

263
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,166
- THIS MISSION IS URGENT.

264
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,166
WE MUST CONTACT EVERYONE NOW.

265
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,333
IF WE FAIL TO DO SO,

266
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,041
SOMETHING TERRIBLE MAY HAPPEN.

267
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,375
- ( meows )

268
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,500
- ( siren blares )
- ( meows )

269
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:09,416
- THAT'S MIHOSHI
AND KIYONE'S PATROL SHIP.

270
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,000
WOW!  WE MUST BE
COSMICALLY CONNECTED.

271
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,666
NO MATTER HOW
FAR APART WE WERE,

272
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,333
THEY WERE ABLE TO
SENSE MY PRESENCE HERE.

273
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:17,583
- Both: YES, PRINCESS.

274
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,666
- Kiyone: STOP RIGHT NOW
AND PULL THAT SHIP OVER.

275
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,083
I DON'T KNOW WHO
YOU CLOWNS ARE, 

276
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,625
BUT YOU'RE EXCEEDING
THE SPEED LIMIT!

277
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:23,583
- All: WHAT?!

278
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,708
- WHAT IS THAT THING
YOU'RE WRITING?

279
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,000
- THIS WOULD BE 
CALLED A TICKET.

280
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,500
- HUH?!

281
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,125
- EVEN THE JURAI PRINCESS
HAS TO OBEY THE TRAFFIC LAWS...

282
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,875
...NO EXCEPTIONS.
- HOW ARE YOU, HUH?

283
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,083
I'M JUST DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU,
PRINCESS, OH BOY!

284
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,708
- YOU WERE GOING 1,000 MILES
OVER THE LIMIT.

285
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:39,791
YOU MUST SIGN THIS FORM.

286
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,708
- OH...

287
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,208
HERE YOU GO.

288
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,708
- THIS COPY'S FOR YOU.

289
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,708
YOU CAN PAY YOUR TICKET 
AT THE PRECINCT STATION,

290
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,375
OR SEND IT IN VIA THE GALAXY
FEDERATION POST OFFICE.

291
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,875
- OFFICER KIYONE?

292
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,375
OH!
- AND SEE TO IT

293
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,041
THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

294
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,875
- UH, KIYONE, WAIT.

295
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,791
I CAME ALL THIS WAY
TO TALK TO BOTH OF YOU.

296
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,000
- HUH?

297
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,333
- DON'T WALK AWAY.

298
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,708
I NEED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

299
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:05,958
PLEASE LISTEN.

300
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,583
COME BACK WITH ME
TO OKAYAMA.

301
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,083
- OH!  WOW,
THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL.

302
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,166
- AH.
- I MUST CONFESS TO YOU,

303
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,750
I MISS MY FAVORITE TV SHOW,

304
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,291
"SPACE POLICE POLICE MAN."

305
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,750
- All: THAT'S US!
- POLICE MAN?

306
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,250
- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO,
KIYONE?

307
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,916
- AS YOU KNOW,
OUR NEW APPOINTMENT

308
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,416
WAS OFFICIALLY
PASSED ONTO US

309
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,250
FROM GALAXY POLICE
HEADQUARTERS.

310
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,583
WE ARE NOT PERMITTED
TO CHANGE OUR BEAT ASSIGNMENTS

311
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:27,875
FOR PERSONAL REASONS.

312
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,416
- I HAVE AN IDEA.
I THINK IT JUST MIGHT WORK.

313
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,041
I WILL ASK
THE JURAI AUTHORITIES

314
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,500
TO CONTACT THE GALAXY POLICE
TO CHANGE YOUR APPOINTMENT. 

315
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,250
- YEAH.  THEN WE'LL BE
BACK ON EARTH IN NO TIME FLAT.

316
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,750
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!

317
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,083
I DON'T WANT AYEKA TO DO
ANY SUCH THING!

318
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,625
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

319
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,583
- WHY ARE YOU MAD?
I'M CONFUSED.

320
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,958
- WE FINALLY GET TRANSFERRED
FROM THE SUBSTATION

321
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,333
ON THAT REMOTE PLANET,

322
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,791
NOW YOU WANT TO GO BACK
AND EXPERIENCE MORE MISERY.

323
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,625
WELL, NOT ME.
- FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE,

324
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,083
DON'T TALK LIKE THAT,
KIYONE.

325
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,291
RYOKO IS MISSING,
WASHU HAS LOCKED HERSELF

326
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,791
UP IN HER LAB
AND WON'T COME OUT,

327
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,083
AND YOU'VE BEEN
REASSIGNED.

328
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,125
THIS IS ALL MAKING ME
TERRIBLY UPSET.

329
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,458
AND BESIDES,
I HAVE A PREMONITION

330
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,416
THAT THESE THINGS
ARE A BAD OMEN.

331
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,458
- OH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT RYOKO.

332
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,750
WE KNOW WHERE TO FIND HER.

333
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,416
- WELL, WHERE IS SHE?
HUH?

334
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,333
- LOOK HERE.
- ARREST WARRANT?

335
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,000
- HER RAP SHEET
FOR THIS WEEK. 

336
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,791
SHE ROBBED A GALAXY UNION BANK
14 TIMES,

337
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,125
THERE'S 157 DAMAGE REPORTS,

338
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:23,458
AND SHE SHOT DOWN 368 SHIPS
OF THE GALAXY POLICE FLEET.

339
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,458
SHE IS DESTROYING EVERYTHING
THAT COMES WITHIN HER RANGE.

340
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:30,041
SHE'S NOW BEEN UPGRADED
TO AN ULTRA CLASS-A CRIMINAL.

341
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,458
- IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

342
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:32,708
- WHAT'S NOT TO BELIEVE?

343
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,041
I MEAN, RYOKO'S A PROFESSIONAL
SPACE PIRATE.

344
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,708
- SHE'S GONE RIGHT BACK
TO HER OLD TRICKS.

345
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,375
IF YOU ASK ME,
WHEN SHE WAS ON EARTH,

346
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,791
SHE WAS LIKE
A FISH OUT OF WATER.

347
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,916
IF YOU HAPPEN TO SPOT HER,
DON'T SAY ANYTHING

348
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,333
TO TIP HER OFF. JUST REPORT
HER TO ME IMMEDIATELY.

349
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,583
- WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO WITH HER?

350
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,250
- WELL NOW,
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE?

351
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:51,250
AFTER ALL, I AM A COP.
I'LL ARREST HER!

352
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,125
AND THEN BE ON MY WAY.

353
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,250
EVERYONE WILL CHEER
MY TRIUMPHANT CAPTURE,

354
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,541
AND I'LL BE PROMOTED
WITH TOP HONORS!

355
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,125
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
YOU CAN'T TURN RYOKO IN,

356
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,833
YOU'D BE RATTING ON
YOUR OWN FRIEND.

357
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,500
- HOW CAN YOU EVEN IMAGINE
THAT RYOKO AND I ARE FRIENDS?

358
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,500
- COME ON.
WE ALL ATE TOGETHER,

359
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,166
WE PLAYED GAMES TOGETHER,
AND WE SHARED

360
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,250
THE JACUZZI TUB WITH
RYOKO, REMEMBER?

361
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,375
- STOP!  DON'T EVER
REPEAT THAT DRIVEL!

362
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:15,041
NO ONE AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS
CAN HEAR A WORD ABOUT IT.

363
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,875
IF THEY DO, MY DREAMS
OF A PROMOTION

364
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,166
WILL GO UP IN SMOKE.

365
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,208
IT NEVER HAPPENED.
PLEASE DON'T.

366
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,875
( whimpers )
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

367
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,708
- HUH?
( clears throat )

368
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,375
THAT TIME I SPENT ON EARTH
IS ANCIENT HISTORY.

369
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,208
I'D RATHER NOT BE
REMINDED OF IT.

370
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,375
I WASN'T ENTIRELY MYSELF
WHILE I WAS THERE.

371
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,708
- IS THIS YOU?

372
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,208
- I GUESS IT IS FOR NOW.

373
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,416
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY,

374
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,083
BUT KIYONE'S CHANGED
QUITE A BIT.

375
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,083
- MIHOSHI,
LET'S GET GOING.

376
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,875
- HEY, THAT HURTS!

377
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,541
DON'T PULL SO HARD, KIYONE.
- QUIT COMPLAINING AND COME ON.

378
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,208
MOVE IT!

379
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,541
- ( laughs )

380
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,250
- Both: WHAT WILL WE
DO NOW, PRINCESS?

381
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,583
- AZAKA AND KAMIDAKE,

382
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,000
WE'RE GOING HOME.

383
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,000
- Both: YES, PRINCESS.

384
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,458
- ( meows )

385
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,041
- ( Sasami humming )
- ( Ryo-Ohki meows )

386
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,458
- AYEKA, THE BATH IS READY
IF YOU WANT TO JUMP IN.

387
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:20,791
- ( meows )

388
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,541
- I HAVE TO GET UP
VERY EARLY TOMORROW,

389
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,875
SO I'LL BE GOING
TO BED NOW.

390
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:24,916
- ( meows )

391
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,958
- 'NIGHT.

392
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,583
- ( meows )

393
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,250
- AYEKA SEEMS DEPRESSED. 
I WISH WE COULD HELP HER.

394
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,250
- ( meows )

395
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,791
- ( sighs )

396
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:40,750
HMM?

397
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,125
- ( sighs )

398
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,000
-  ( beeps )

399
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,375
- ( phone rings )

400
00:17:58,458 --> 00:17:59,458
- HUH?

401
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,583
HI, THIS IS TENCHI.

402
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,708
- Ayeka:
NICE TO HEAR YOUR VOICE.

403
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,958
- THAT YOU, PRINCESS?
- YES, IT'S ME.

404
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,458
I JUST CALLED TO ASK
IF YOU WOULD MIND

405
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:09,625
COMING HOME RIGHT NOW.

406
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,125
- WHY?  WHAT HAPPENED?

407
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,208
IS SOMETHING GOING ON THERE,
AYEKA?  TELL ME.

408
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,000
- WELL, NOT EXACTLY.

409
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,000
IT'S JUST THAT I HAVE
A GLOOMY PREMONITION 

410
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,291
THAT SOMETHING HORRIBLE
MAY HAPPEN.

411
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,291
- Tenchi: LIKE WHAT?

412
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,333
- I DON'T KNOW.

413
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,541
BUT I'M PICKING UP
BAD VIBES

414
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,083
STARTING WITH OUR
FAMILY BREAKING UP.

415
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,083
WASHU HAS LOCKED HERSELF
UP IN THE LAB

416
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,625
AND HASN'T COME OUT
FOR SO LONG.

417
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,291
- THAT'S ALL?
DON'T WORRY. 

418
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,000
SOUNDS PRETTY NORMAL TO ME.

419
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,000
- WELL, MIHOSHI
AND KIYONE ARE GONE.

420
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,666
THEY WERE TRANSFERRED TO
THE 62nd PRECINCT.

421
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,875
- THAT'S GREAT.

422
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,333
SOUNDS LIKE
A BIG STEP UP FOR THEM.

423
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:39,750
I BET THEY'RE VERY HAPPY.

424
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,541
- AND I STILL HAVEN'T
FOUND RYOKO

425
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,458
WHO LEFT HERE AS WELL.

426
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,875
- HUH?
WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

427
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,166
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN
A VERY UNPREDICTABLE WOMAN.

428
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,958
DON'T BE UPSET.
SHE'LL TURN UP 

429
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,166
ONE OF THESE DAYS,
I'M SURE OF IT.

430
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,000
- BUT DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S PRETTY ODD.

431
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,000
I MEAN, ALL OF US
WERE SO CLOSE

432
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:58,250
AND THEN WITHOUT ANY DISCUSSION
OR REAL REASON THAT I CAN SEE, 

433
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,041
WE'VE ALL JUST
SUDDENLY SPLIT UP.

434
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,375
- YEAH, SO?

435
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:02,750
- IT HAPPENED SO FAST.

436
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,375
ALMOST LIKE THERE WAS
A FORCE BEHIND THESE EVENTS.

437
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,791
I GUESS THAT MUST SOUND
A LITTLE CRAZY TO YOU. 

438
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,208
- AYEKA, YOU'RE BEING
A WORRYWART. QUIT IT.

439
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,041
THEY'LL ALL COME BACK
EVENTUALLY.

440
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,041
CHILL, OKAY?

441
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,041
I HAVE TO STUDY
FOR MY FINALS. 

442
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,208
UNLESS THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE,
I'D BETTER GET BACK TO WORK.

443
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,916
SO GOOD-BYE NOW.
- WAIT!

444
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,708
PLEASE DON'T HANG UP ON ME,
TENCHI!

445
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,041
- HUH?
- TENCHI!

446
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,375
- YEAH?

447
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:26,791
- OH, GOOD.
YOU'RE THERE.

448
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,375
- WHAT'S WRONG, AYEKA?

449
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,708
- I-- I MEAN...

450
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,041
- WHAT IS IT?
- I JUST WANTED TO SAY...

451
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,500
THAT I...

452
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,750
I...

453
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,208
- ( kettle whistling )

454
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,916
- Tenchi: YEAH?

455
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,166
AYEKA?

456
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,625
- ( kettle whistles )

457
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,625
- I LOVE YOU, TENCHI.
VERY MUCH.

458
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,416
WORDS JUST CAN'T EXPRESS
MY FEELINGS FOR YOU.

459
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,583
- HUH?

460
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,625
- I LOVE YOU FROM
THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.

461
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,916
TENCHI, I JUST WANTED YOU
TO KNOW THAT.

462
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,916
YOU MAY LAUGH,
BUT I CAN'T HELP IT.

463
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,250
I WORRY THAT IF WE'RE NOT
ALL AROUND TO TAKE CARE OF YOU,

464
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,250
SOMETHING JUST MIGHT
HAPPEN TO YOU.

465
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,375
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.
IT'S DUMB.

466
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,833
BUT I HAD TO TELL YOU
I LOVE YOU

467
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,375
EVEN IF YOU'VE
HEARD IT BEFORE.

468
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,416
I JUST WANTED YOU
TO HEAR IT AGAIN.

469
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,083
- ( kettle whistles )

470
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,750
- TENCHI, ARE YOU LISTENING?

471
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,458
- YES, THAT WAS
SWEET OF YOU.

472
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:22,083
AND YOU KNOW I LIKE YOU
A LOT TOO.

473
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,208
- ( gasps )
I'M GLAD, TENCHI.

474
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,541
- ( doorbell rings )

475
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,000
- AYEKA, CAN YOU 
HOLD ON A MINUTE?

476
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,416
SOMEBODY RANG MY DOORBELL.

477
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,125
HELLO, DON'T GO AWAY.
I'M ON THE PHONE.

478
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,458
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

479
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,125
- BYE FOR NOW, TENCHI.

00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,208
WANNA COME IN

484
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:54,750
- NO, I'D BETTER NOT.

485
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,750
I JUST WANTED TO BRING YOU
A MIDNIGHT SNACK.

486
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:57,875

490
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:04,833
OH.

491
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,333
THANKS FOR HOLDING.
NOW I'M BACK.

492
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,250
HUH?

493
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,458
- I JUST WON'T GIVE UP.

494
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,666
I'LL FIND SOME WAY
TO BRING US BACK TOGETHER.

495
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,583
AND I WILL HAVE TENCHI
BACK WITH ME.

496
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:20,583
I CAN DO IT, AYEKA.
I CAN DO IT.

497
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,500
- SHE'S NOT ALL THAT SMART,
IS SHE?

498
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,041
SHE'S UNAWARE THAT
WHEN SHE TRIES

499
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:24,833
TO BRING THEM TOGETHER,

500
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,000
THEY GET FURTHER APART.

501
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,166
- IT SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISING,
I EXPECT.

502
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,083
EVERYONE'S FATE IS DIFFERENT.

503
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,208

504
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,875

- Kiyone:
HI, I'M KIYONE.

508
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,500
IT WAS ONLY A SHORT WHILE AGO

509
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:18,500
WE ALL LIVED AS ONE
BIG HAPPY FAMILY ON EARTH.

510
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:20,833
WHO COULD HAVE IMAGINED THEN
THAT THERE WOULD COME A DAY 

511
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,833
WHEN WE WOULD HAVE TO
ARREST RYOKO!

512
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,500
BUT DUTY IS DUTY,

513
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:27,041
AND WHEN I ACCOMPLISH
THIS MISSION SUCCESSFULLY,

514
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:29,250
MY RETURN TO HQ 
AND MY PROMOTION

515
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:30,833
ARE GUARANTEED.

516
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:32,291
LET'S GO, MIHOSHI.

517
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:33,916
WE'LL ARREST
THE SPACE PIRATE RYOKO

518
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,250
ALL BY OURSELVES.

THE NEW TENCHI MUYO SERIES,
