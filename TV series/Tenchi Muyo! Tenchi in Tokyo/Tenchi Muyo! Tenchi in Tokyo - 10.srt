I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

- HUH?
- I THINK I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

36
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,208
ALL THEY CAN TALK ABOUT
IS CARS AND WRESTLING.

37
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,791
- AND WHAT'S REALLY STUPID
IS THEY DON'T KNOW A LOT

38
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,250
ABOUT EITHER SUBJECT.
- ( girls laughing )

39
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,291
- FROM NOW ON, I'M ONLY
GOING TO DATE BOYS

AT LEAST
TWO YEARS OLDER THAN ME.

00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,000
- WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT?
BETTER TELL US RIGHT NOW.

42

00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,125
- Girl #2:
NAH, HE'S TOO CLEAN CUT.

46
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,208
I LIKE GUYS WHO HAVE
SOME KIND OF WILD LOOK.

47
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,333
MAYBE AN EARRING OR TATTOO.

48
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,083
- WELL, THEN HOW ABOUT THAT ONE
RIGHT THERE?

49
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:42,125
- NO, THAT GUY LOOKS
JUST LIKE A MONKEY.

50
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,875
- IT HAPPENS THAT MONKEY LOOKS
ARE VERY "IN" AT THE MOMENT.

51
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,416
- Both: HUH?  NO WAY!

52
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,791
- TURN THE PAGE.  MAYBE
THE CHOICES WILL BE BETTER.

53
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,916
- IT'S SO HARD FOR ME TO FIND
SOMEONE I'D REALLY LIKE.

54
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,083
- OH, NOW'S HERE'S ONE
I COULD LIKE A LOT.

55
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,291
- WELL, LET ME SEE.
- WOW!

56
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,333
- HEY, SAKUYA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
- HUH?

57
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,416
- YOU MUST HAVE A FAVORITE
TYPE OF GUY, TOO, RIGHT?

58
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,375
- OH, RIGHT.

59
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:05,208
RIGHT.  UH...

60
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,833
- All: TELL ME.
- ( laughs )

61
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,625
SOMEBODY WHO WAITS FOR ME,
I THINK.

62
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,833
SOMEBODY WHO WAITS FOR YOU?

63
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,375
(all:) WHATEVER DO
YOU MEAN BY THAT?

64
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,750
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
- ( laughs )

65
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,875
I'M AFRAID I DON'T UNDERSTAND
IT EITHER.  SORRY.

66
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,583
- I DO.
YOU'RE JUST BEING CHILDISH.

67
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,125
YOU KNOW,
YOU SHOULDN'T BE LIKE THAT.

68
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,208
- SHE'S RIGHT.
WE'RE NOT THAT YOUNG ANYMORE.

69
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,958
WE DON'T HAVE TIME
TO WAIT AROUND.

70
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,166
- YEP, WE NEED TO TAKE DATING
INTO OUR OWN HANDS.

71
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,666
- I GUESS SO.

72
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,166
- LOOK WHAT I SEE.
THIS BOY IS MINE.

73
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,416
- YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.
- I DON'T THINK HE'S SO BAD.

74
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,416
- WE REALLY HAD YOU GOING THERE
FOR A WHILE DIDN'T WE, BUDDY?

75
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,666
- NEXT TIME TRY YOUR HEAD HOLD
ON SOMEBODY ELSE.

76
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,750
- ( sighs )

77
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,916
- HMM?  WONDER WHO CALLED.

78
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,291
- You have two messages.
- ( beeps )

79
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,750
- Ryoko: Hi, Tenchi, it's me.

80
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,083
- I wanna go on a date
with you this Sunday.

81
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:24,000
Now don't you dare tell that
little fool Ayeka about this.

82
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,875
Meet me in Station Park at noon.
See you then.

83
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,500
- And if you don't show up,
you know what'll happen.

84
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,791
Bye-bye.
- OH, BOY, DO I.

85
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:35,125
- Hi, Tenchi.  It's Sakuya.
- HUH?

86
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,791
I'm calling to see if you
would like to take a walk

87
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:41,541
in Station Park this weekend
if the weather's nice.

88
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:44,291
So let me know
if you're interested, okay?

89
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,583
Bye for now.

94

- ( moans )

96
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,541
JUST AS I SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED,
RYOKO'S RUNNING LATE.

97
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,500
COME TO THINK OF IT,
I DON'T BELIEVE I'VE EVER

98
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,250
GONE OUT ANYWHERE WITH RYOKO
ALONE BEFORE TODAY.

99
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,625
- TENCHI.
- OH!  YOU'RE LATE.

100
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,958
- OH!
- I'M SORRY.

101
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:02,708
BUT I'M HERE NOW, TENCHI.
HAVE YOU MISSED ME?

102
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,041
I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

103
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,291
WE'LL SPEND THE WHOLE DAY
TOGETHER, ALL RIGHT?

104
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,875
AREN'T YOU HAPPY, TENCHI?

105
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:10,541
- I'M OKAY, I GUESS.
- ( laughing )

106
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,958
WELL, COME ON, SAY SOMETHING.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

107
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,708
I LOOK PRETTY TODAY, RIGHT?

108
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,833
- RYOKO, WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU?

109
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,833
- OH, YOU NAUGHTY BOY.

110
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,708
YOU HAVE THAT BACKWARDS.

111
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,208
YOU MEAN WHAT IS
<i>GOING</i> TO HAPPEN TO US.

112
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,541
- ( boy laughing )
- ( boy mocking )

113
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,541
- ( crowd murmuring )
- Ryoko: HUH?

114
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,541
WHAT'S EVERYBODY GAWKING AT?
BEAT IT!  BUZZ OFF!

115
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,416
( shrieks )

116
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,250
DON'T WORRY, TENCHI.  WE'RE
ALONE.  IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.

117
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,666
NOW LET'S GO VISIT
ALL THE FASHIONABLE "IN" SPOTS.

118
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,416
- DON'T CLING SO TIGHT, OKAY?
MY NECK CAN'T TAKE IT.

119
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,708
- ALL RIGHT, GIVE ME YOUR HAND.
HERE WE GO, TENCHI.

120
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,333
- ( laughs )

121
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,500
- Ryoko: GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE!

122
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,666
- I DON'T GET WHY THIS SPOT
IS ON THE "IN" LIST.

123
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,166
- YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

124
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,250
BEEF BOWL RESTAURANTS
ARE VERY TRENDY RIGHT NOW.

125
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,958
LOOK AROUND YOU.

126
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,125

127
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,833
COME ON, OPEN WIDE.  AHHH!

128
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:34,375
- ALL RIGHT, HIROSHI, DO IT!

129
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:37,583
( grunts ) YES!

130
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:40,125

WOW!

131
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,666

132
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,666

133
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:52,375
- NOW THAT'S POWER, FRIEND.

134
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,958
( shouts )
- I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

135
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,333
- WHAT DID I DO?
LET GO.  YOU'RE HURTING ME.

136
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,333
- ( both gasp )
- WHAT'S THE BIG RUSH ANYWAY?

137
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,583

- WHAT DID YOU SEE?

138
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,791
- YOU ARE TOO MUCH!
- ( chattering )

139
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,333
- RYOKO, THERE ARE TOO MANY
AHEAD OF US.

140
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,833
WE'LL NEVER GET IN.

141
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,500
HUH?

142
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:15,458
- TENCHI!  TENCHI, OVER HERE.

143
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,125
THERE'S NO LINE AT ALL,
AND LOOK WHAT THEY OFFER.

144
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,166
- THEY TAKE PHOTO IDs?

145
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,833
- ( camera shutter clicking )
- HA HA!

146
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:28,791
( vocalizes )

147
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:32,166
OH, YEAH!

148
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,291
Ryoko:
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!

149
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,875
HOW DARE YOU MESS
WITH MY PERFORMANCE!

150
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,708
- COME ON, RYOKO, STOP IT!
- I WON'T BE COMING BACK.

151
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,541
YOU HEAR ME?!

152
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,000
- HEY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

153
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:57,000
- Girl: HONEY, WAIT UP!

154
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,916
WAIT FOR ME!

155
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,500

SHALL WE?

157
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,250
- LET'S NOT.
- HOW COME?

158
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,958
IT'S BEEN A LOT OF FUN SO FAR.

159
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,958
- OH, YEAH? 
WELL, MAYBE FOR YOU.

160
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,541
- YOU SHOULD TRY TO ENJOY
YOURSELF MORE.  HOW ABOUT IT?

161
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,375
- I REALLY DON'T THINK SO.
- HAVING FUN.

162
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:42,416
ISN'T THAT ALL THAT MATTERS?
- NO, THAT'S WRONG.

163
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,708
- CAN'T YOU PRETEND IT'S RIGHT?
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

164
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:48,625
- THIS IS STUPID.
I'VE HAD ENOUGH.  HUH?

165
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:05,291
- Sasami:
RYOKO, WHERE ARE YOU?  RYOKO.

166
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:09,166
ARE YOU IN THERE?
COME ON, ANSWER ME.

167
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,125
I'M COMING IN NOW.

168
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,875
IT'S ME.

169
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,375
HUH?

170
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,958
"COLOR YOUR ROMANTIC EVENING.
PUT LOVE ON YOUR LIPS

171
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:24,166
WITH NIGHT PEARL ROUGE."

172
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,250
OH!

173
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,500
WOW!  IT'S LOVELY.

174
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:41,208
- HMM.  HEY, WHY ARE YOU
STANDING THERE, STARING AT ME?

175
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,500
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
RYOKO'S WEARING MAKEUP.

176
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,375
( laughing )

177
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,416
- WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING
WHEN YOU LOOK A ME?

178
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,875
JUST WHAT'S SO AMUSING?
- NOTHING.

179
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,791
- I DEMAND TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.  HUH?

180
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,375
- ALL RIGHT,
WHERE ARE WE GOING NEXT?

181
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,541
- HMM?
- GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

182
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:12,041
- TENCHI.

183
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:53,166
- ( sighs )
IT WAS NO BIG DEAL.

184
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,500
I MEAN, HE JUST TOOK MY HAND.

185
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,583
- ( sighs )

186
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,125
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
COME OVER ME.

187
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,791
I DON'T SEEM TO BE ACTING
LIKE MYSELF RIGHT NOW.

188
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,916
- ( screams )
- ( laughing )

189
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,208
- NOT FUNNY!
- ( gasps )

190
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,125
TENCHI.

191
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,833
- HERE.
- I'M TOO UPSET.

192
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,333
I'M NOT THIRSTY ANYMORE.

193
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:28,833
- IS THERE ANY OTHER PLACE
YOU'D LIKE TO VISIT?

194
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:32,041
- UH... HMM.

195
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:35,833
WELL, YES, OF COURSE THERE IS.
- OKAY.

196
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,166
- WHY DON'T WE MAKE
IT ANOTHER TIME?

197
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,041
IT'S GETTING LATE.
- HUH?

198
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,375
I GUESS I REALLY HAD
TOO MUCH FUN TODAY.

199
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:53,541
- RYOKO, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

200
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,958
- WELL, THINGS TO DO.
GOTTA GO NOW.

201
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,416
LET'S DO THIS AGAIN.
SEE YOU.

202
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,250
GOOD NIGHT.
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

203
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,166
BYE-BYE.

204
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,166
- GOSH, SHE'S SURE SELFISH.

205
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,375
AND UNPREDICTABLE.

206
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:25,541
YET, SOMEHOW I'M ATTRACTED
TO HER.

207
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:28,250
SHE WAS KIND OF CUTE TONIGHT.

208
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,291
- Sakuya: TENCHI.
- HUH?

209
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:55,625
IT'S YOU, SAKUYA.

210
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,041
- HERE YOU GO.

211
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,916
- SHE MUST HAVE BEEN HANGING OUT
IN THE PARK ALL DAY LONG

212
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,875
WAITING FOR ME.

213
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:24,791
- it's Sakuya.  I'm calling
to see if you would like

214
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,416
to take a walk
in Station Park this weekend,

215
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,916
if the weather is nice.

216
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,750
So let me know
if you're interested, okay?

217
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,791
Bye for now.

218
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:37,208
- UGH!
I'M SORRY, SAKUYA.

219
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,166
- ( sobbing )

220
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,958
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN THINKING,

221
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,958
TRYING TO COME UP
WITH SOMETHING,

222
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,916
TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT I DID WRONG.

223
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,791
- LISTEN, YOU DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

224
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:57,541
- YOU SEE, I KNOW I'M KIND OF
NOISY AND A LITTLE BIT HYPER.

225
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,916
- BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE.
- AND I DON'T HAVE

226
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,750
THE GREATEST FIGURE EITHER.

227
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,500
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- AND I CAN'T COOK.

228
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,583
I BURN EVERYTHING.
- WHAT POINT ARE YOU TRYING

229
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,000
TO MAKE?

230
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,791
- LIFE IS KIND OF...

231
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:19,125
STRANGE MOST TIMES,
ISN'T IT?

232
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,125
FOR A LONG TIME NOW,

233
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,208
I'VE BEEN SEEING
THIS ONE IMAGE.

234
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,666
- HUH?
- ON MY WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL,

235
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,833
AS I'M WALKING ALONE THROUGH
THE CAMPUS GROUNDS AT DUSK,

236
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:33,041
I SEE THE LONG SHADOW
OF SOMEONE WAITING FOR ME.

237
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:38,375
OR IT COULD JUST BE ME
WAITING FOR YOU.

238
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,583
I AM ALONE,
BUT IN THE COMPANY OF THIS IMAGE

239
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:46,000
I AM NOT LONELY.
I ANTICIPATE THE TENDER MOMENT

240
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,583
WHEN I'LL BE HOLDING
THIS SPECIAL SOMEONE

241
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,458
WHO IS WAITING FOR ME.

242
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:55,083
I'VE DREAMED OF THIS
FOR A LONG TIME NOW.

243
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,875
AN IMAGE HAS ALWAYS
BEEN PRESENT,

244
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,041
BUT NOW I KNOW FOR SURE,
IT'S NOT YOU.

245
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:02,583
TENCHI, YOU'RE NOT
WAITING FOR ME.

246
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:07,083
I SEE VERY CLEARLY NOW
YOU ALREADY HAVE SOMEONE

247
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:10,333
WHO'S WAITING FOR YOU.
- SAKUYA, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

248
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,500
YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG.
I CAN EXPLAIN.

249
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,375
- LIAR.
- WHAT?

250
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:15,708
- I CAN TELL WHEN YOU'RE LYING

251
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,083
BECAUSE YOUR NOSE BEGINS
TO TWITCH AND DON'T BOTHER

252
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,833
TO COVER IT UP.
I'VE ALREADY SEEN IT.

253
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:23,666
- UH... HUH?

254
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,666
- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE REALLY
A LOUSY LIAR, TENCHI.

255
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,083
- I'M NOT LYING!  HUH?

256
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,541
- ( sobbing )
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

257
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,416
I'M SORRY I LAID
ALL THIS STUFF ON YOU.

258
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,916
I SHOULDN'T HAVE BOTHERED YOU.

259
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,416
SEE YOU AROUND, BYE.

260
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,625
( grunts )

261
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,416
- ( laughing )

262
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,333
- all: WHOA!

263
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:44,041
- SHE ISN'T HER MOODY SELF.
I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.

264
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,708
- DEFINITELY STRANGE.
- IS IT THE END OF THE CENTURY?

265
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,333
- IT MUST HAVE BEEN AWFULLY GOOD
WHATEVER IT WAS THAT HAPPENED.

266
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,625
- SHE'S WAY TOO CHEERY,
AND I DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL.

267
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,916
- AYEKA, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU TODAY?

268
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,083
WHY ARE YOU MAKING FACES, HUH?

269
00:20:57,166 --> 00:21:01,375
- NOTHING'S WRONG.
- OKAY, I'LL GO ALONG WITH THAT.

270
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:04,666
HERE YOU GO.  YOU CAN HAVE SOME
OF MY OMELET IF YOU'D LIKE.

271
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,166
OKAY?
- ( all gasp )

272
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,125
- WHAT?
- HUH?

273
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:11,208
- ( screeches )
- NO, THANK YOU, I JUST ATE--

274
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,875
- ( Ryoko laughing )
- ( Ayeka mumbling )

275
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:23,500
- IT'S FOR YOU.

276
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,208
- ( screaming )

277
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:31,875
- ( laughs )

278
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,000
- ( theme music playing )

279
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,000
- ( singing in Japanese )

280
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:05,666
- ( meowing )

281
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,958
- HI, I'M SASAMI.

282
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:17,750
RYO-OHKI
HAS BEEN SO NAUGHTY LATELY.

283
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:20,750
OH, NO, NOW LOOK WHAT
YOU'VE DONE, RYO-OHKI!

284
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,833
YOU KNOW, GRANDFATHER
TREASURES THIS STATUE.

285
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:25,041
YOU CAN'T JUST BREAK IT

286
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:27,750
AND THEN THINK YOU CAN
GET AWAY WITH IT.

287
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:30,625
IT ONLY MAKES IT WORSE
IF YOU TRY TO LIE ABOUT IT.

288
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:34,958
OH, I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO WITH YOU ANYMORE.

289
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:37,791
