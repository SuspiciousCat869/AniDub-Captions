1
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,541
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:11,000
- ( liquid bubbling )
- ( knife hitting board )

3
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:19,000
- WHA--?

4
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,125
OH.

5
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,875
OW!

6
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,500
I'VE GOT TO LEARN TO COOK
BETTER THAN THIS SOMEHOW.

7
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,666
OTHERWISE I'M GOING TO STARVE
WHILE I'M HERE IN TOKYO.

8
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,083
OH, YUCK.

9
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,833
I REALLY MISS ALL THAT STUFF
SASAMI COOKS.

10
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,083
( sighs )

11
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,291
- READY, HUH, RYO-OHKI?

12
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,125
HERE WE GO!
- MEOW!

13
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,916
MEOW.

14
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,416
- HEY, DON'T EAT
THE INGREDIENTS.

15
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,125
- MEOW.

16
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,833
- WE'RE HAVING SOUP
AND YUMMY KOBE BEEF

17
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,750
WITH NICE, FRESH CARROTS
ON THE SIDE.

18
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:56,958
- MEOW!

19
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,666
- FLIP IT WAY UP HIGH
TO COOK IT RIGHT.

20
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,875
WHEN THE STEAK IS FINISHED,
PUT IT ON THE PLATE.

21
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,500
THEN THE DELICIOUS
MISO SOUP IS NEXT.

22
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,541
TOO-DOO-DOO-TOO,
LA-LA-LA-LA,

23
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,083
BOOP-BAH-BAH-BOOP.
YAY!

24
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,000
( strikes gong )

25
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:13,083
THE SASAMI SPECIAL
IS READY TO EAT.

26
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,541
( giggles )

27
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,541
- I AM THE ABSOLUTE
NUMBER ONE,

28
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,708
THE CREATOR
AND THE RULER OF ALL.

29
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:35,416
THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE
COMPLETELY FOLLOWED MY WILL,

30
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,375
COME FORWARD
AND BE BORN.

31
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,208
( chuckles )
WELL, HOW DO YOU DO,

32
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,666
MY DARLING
SERVANTS OF EVIL?

33
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,666
- ( birds chirping )

34
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,958
- ( footsteps )

35
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,958
- ( doorbell rings )
- ( exclaims )

36
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,625
YES, WHO IS IT?

37
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:20,916
- GOOD MORNING.

38
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,875
HI, TENCHI.
( laughs )

39
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,875
- ARGH!  SAKUYA!
IT'S SUNDAY MORNING.

40
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,791
WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU
DOING HERE SO EARLY?

41
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,458
- DO I NEED A REASON
TO COME AND VISIT YOU?

42
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,916
- OH, NO, I DIDN'T
MEAN IT LIKE THAT.

43
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,958
- ( laughs ) TENCHI, I WANT
TO SHOW YOU AROUND TODAY.

44
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,541
WE'LL GO WALKING TOGETHER.
IT'LL BE LOTS OF FUN.

45
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,166
I MEAN, YOU JUST MOVED HERE AND
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH OF TOKYO,

46
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,166
SO I'LL BE YOUR TOUR GUIDE
IF YOU WANT.

47
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,125
- WELL, I'M NOT REALLY SURE.
YOU KNOW...

48
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:50,000
- SAY, TENCHI, YOU HAVEN'T
EATEN BREAKFAST YET, HAVE YOU?

49
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,000
- WELL, I WAS
GOING TO, BUT--

50
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,958
- GOOD, 'CAUSE I'M GONNA
MAKE BREAKFAST FOR YOU.

51
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,000
- YOU CAN GET ANYTHING
IN TOKYO, CAN'T YOU?

52
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,416
I MEAN, IT'S ALL
READY-MADE.

53
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,708
- YOU'RE MISSING
THE POINT, TENCHI.

54
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,291
SHOPPING IS A FINE ART HERE.
YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE CAREFULLY.

55
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,166
I WENT TO FIVE
CONVENIENCE STORES,

56
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,833
AND YOU DON'T LIKE
MY BREAKFAST.

57
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,541
- NO, I LIKE IT,
REALLY.

58
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,750
- YOU DO?
NO KIDDING?

59
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:20,958
THEN GO AHEAD
AND DIG IN.

60
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,125
- RIGHT.  BON APPETIT.

61
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,541
- IS IT GOOD?
- OH, YEAH, IT'S GREAT.

62
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,666
- I KNEW YOU'D LIKE IT.
GO AHEAD AND HAVE SOME MORE.

63
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,125
- I'LL MAKE SOME TEA.
- THANKS.

64
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,541
- ( grunting )

65
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:40,250
- WHAT IS THAT CONNIVING GIRL
DOING IN TENCHI'S BEDROOM?

66
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,666
- HOW WOULD I KNOW?

67
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,541
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
SINCE IT'S SUNDAY,

68
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,541
I WAS PLANNING
TO VISIT HIM MYSELF, RYOKO.

69
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,458
- ( both growling )

70
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:50,791
- AYEKA, RYOKO,
BREAKFAST IS READY, YOU GUYS.

71
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,791
- I'M TOO BUSY
FOR THAT RIGHT NOW.

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,125
( both scream )

73
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,916
- ( Tenchi giggles )

74
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,791
- SHE'S ACTING LIKE A BRIDE
ON A HONEYMOON.

75
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,083
I ENVY--
I MEAN, DESPISE HER.

76
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,916
- OH, LOOK AT MY TENCHI.
LOOK AT THE WAY HE'S BLUSHING.

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,916
HEY, BACK OFF HIM, GIRL!

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,416
- THAT'S WHAT
I WAS GOING TO SAY,

79
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,916
BECAUSE LORD TENCHI IS MINE.
SHE CAN'T JUST GO

80
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
SNATCHING HIM AWAY
LIKE SOME HORRIBLE ALLEY CAT.

81
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,708
- YOU STAY AWAY FROM MY
TENCHI, I'M TELLING YOU.

82
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,833
- ( both grunting )

83
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,833
- Ryoko: HEY, LET GO OF ME.
- NO, I'M NOT LETTING YOU GO.

84
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,000
- I'M GONNA GET YOU BACK, AYEKA.
- I'M GONNA GET YOU.

85
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,500
OH, YOU, YOU--

86
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,250
- ( both scream )

87
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,625
- IS SOMEONE ELSE HERE?

88
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,833
- OH, NO, IT'S THE SOUND
OF MY NEIGHBOR'S TV.

89
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,000
I HEAR IT
ALL THE TIME.

90
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,500
YOU KNOW,
THEY PLAY IT SO LOUD

91
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,250
AND THE WALLS ARE
AWFULLY THIN.

92
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,250
- OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.

93
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,208
- ( giggles )

94
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,458
THOSE GIRLS WILL GET ME
INTO TROUBLE

95
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,625
IF I STAY HERE
ANY LONGER.

96
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,625
- GOOD MORNING.

97
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,291
OH.  HEY, WHAT ARE
YOU TWO DOING?

98
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,000
- WASHU?  GOOD.
YOU GOT HERE JUST IN TIME.

99
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,000
- YES, WASHU, CAN YOU
OPEN THIS PORTAL?

100
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,250
IT'S STUCK
OR SOMETHING.

101
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,500
- WE CAN ONLY REACH THROUGH
THIS FAR, SEE?

102
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:02,291
- WELL, IT'S A DIMENSION TUNNEL.
THERE'S NO WAY THROUGH.

103
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,333
UNLESS TENCHI OPENS IT
FROM THE OTHER SIDE,

104
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,666
WE CAN FORGET IT.

105
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,625
- OH, WELL, IN THAT CASE,
I'LL JUST BLOW IT OUT.

106
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,041
- WHAT?

107
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,083
NO, WAIT A SECOND,
RYOKO.

108
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,166
- Sasami: RYOKO, DON'T GET
CARRIED AWAY.

109
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,541
CALM DOWN.
- Ayeka: RYOKO, BE REASONABLE.

110
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,458
- FULL POWER.
( screams )

111
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:27,375
- ( Sasami screams )
- MEOW!

112
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,875
- ARGH.

113
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,583
- TOLD YOU
NOT TO DO THAT.

114
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,500
ALL YOUR POWER'S EXHAUSTED.
LOOK AT YOU.

115
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:43,000
- ( groans )
TENCHI.

116
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,541
- THEY'RE TRYING
TO FORCE THEIR WAY

117
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,291
THROUGH THE DIMENSIONAL
TUNNEL-- JUST WHAT I NEED.

118
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,375
- READY TO GO SEE
THE TOWN, TENCHI?

119
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,916
- HMM?  OH, YEAH.

120
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,166
- ( Sakuya giggles ) I'LL SHOW
YOU AROUND HARAJUKU FIRST.

121
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,916
- YEAH, SOUNDS GREAT.

122
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,083
- ( girls grunting )

123
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:08,041
- TAKE THIS.
TAKE THIS.  TAKE THIS.

124
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,208
- OH, IT'S NO USE.

125
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,916
WE'RE NEVER GOING TO
GET THROUGH IT THIS WAY.

126
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,625
- MEOW.

127
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:17,041
- WHOA.  HEY, THAT'S IT.
- MEOW?

128
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:20,041
- AHA!  MY, YOU'RE EXACTLY
WHAT WE NEED, RYO-OHKI.

129
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,000
- MEOW?

130
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,583
MEOW!
- Ryoko: QUIET.

131
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,458
WHEN YOU GET TO THE OTHER SIDE,
PULL BACK THE COMFORTER.

132
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:29,208
- MEOW!

133
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,416
- COME ON, YOU CAN GET
THROUGH THERE, YOU LITTLE RAT.

134
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,916
PUSH!
- MEOW!

135
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,416
- ( people chattering )

136
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,166
- COOL, HUH?
- YEAH, TERRIFIC.

137
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,458
- ( laughs ) LOOK AT THIS.

138
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,708
- MEOW!

139
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,583
- COME ON, RYO-OHKI,
QUIT HOLDING BACK.

140
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,125
YOU CAN GET
THROUGH THERE.

141
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,750
- YES, TRY HARDER.
GO ON.

142
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,583
- HEY, LEAVE RYO-OHKI ALONE.
YOU'RE HURTING HER.

143
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,250
CUT IT OUT,
YOU GUYS.

144
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,500
MISS WASHU,
MAKE THEM STOP.

145
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,083
- I TOLD THEM,
YOU CAN'T GET THROUGH THERE.

146
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,458
- LET'S GO THIS WAY.
- HMM?

147
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,666
- IT'S A LITTLE SHORTCUT.
COME ON, TENCHI.

148
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,166
- OH, RIGHT.

149
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,958
THIS IS KIND OF
A STRANGE AREA.

150
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,791
- IT'S-- IT'S GETTING
ALL FOGGY.

151
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,500
- WHOA.

152
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,750
LOOK OVER THAT WAY.
DO YOU SEE IT?

153
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,958
- WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY
MANSION.

154
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,500
BUT I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING
ANYTHING LIKE THIS

155
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,458
AROUND HERE BEFORE.

156
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,291
HEY, MAYBE SOMEONE FAMOUS
LIVES HERE, YOU KNOW?

157
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,500
- WELL, WHOEVER LIVES HERE,
THEY MUST HAVE A TON OF MONEY.

158
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,166
I MEAN, THIS PLACE IS HUGE.
LOOK AT IT.

159
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,958
- HEY, TENCHI, WHY DON'T WE
TAKE A LOOK INSIDE?

160
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,666
- WHAT?  SAKUYA, NO.
WE'LL GET IN TROUBLE.

161
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,083
- ( Sakuya laughs )

162
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,833
- UH, HOLD ON A MINUTE.

163
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:32,791
- AHA.

164
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,541
OOH.

165
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,375
OH, WOW.

166
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,166
- SAKUYA, WE'RE NOT
ALLOWED IN HERE.

167
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,208
- ( both exclaim )

168
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,875
( both grunting )

169
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,875
- WELCOME TO THE HOUSE
OF THE ETERNAL PLEDGE.

170
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:57,875
- ( both gasp )

171
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,750
- MEOW.

172
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,250
MEOW.

173
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,750
- MEOW, MEOW.

174
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,083
- UH, WE'RE SORRY.

175
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,791
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE COME IN
WITHOUT ASKING.

176
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,416
BUT WE'RE LEAVING
RIGHT NOW.

177
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,791
- IT'S MY FAULT.
SORRY.

178
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,958
- YOU DON'T NEED
TO APOLOGIZE.  IT'S ALL RIGHT.

179
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,083
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I'M HAVING A PARTY TODAY.

180
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,166
SINCE YOU'RE HERE,
WHY DON'T YOU JOIN ME, PLEASE?

181
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,583
- WOW, A PARTY.
YEAH!

182
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,708
- HOW RUDE OF ME
NOT TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

183
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,541
I AM HOTSUMA,
THE MASTER OF THIS ESTATE.

184
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,083
NOW PLEASE
COME THIS WAY.

185
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,791
- I THINK
WE SHOULD GO.

186
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,625
UH...

187
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,333
OH.

188
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,666
- THIS MANSION
IS SO BEAUTIFUL.

189
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,125
- IT IS PART
OF A LEGEND.

190
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,791
THE HOUSE
OF THE ETERNAL PLEDGE--

191
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,625
THAT'S WHAT
PEOPLE CALL IT.

192
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:21,208
LONG AGO A NOBLEMAN LIVED HERE
WITH HIS BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER.

193
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:24,416
SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH A YOUNG
MAN WHO WAS ONLY A SERVANT.

194
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,416
BECAUSE THEY BELONGED
TO DIFFERENT CLASSES,

195
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,750
THE YOUNG LOVERS REALIZED THEY
WOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED TO MARRY,

196
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:33,125
SO THEY PLEDGED EVERLASTING LOVE
HERE, ON THIS SPOT.

197
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,750
THEN THEY ENDED THEIR LIVES
WITH THEIR OWN HAND.

198
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,375
- WHAT A SAD STORY.

199
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:40,333
- THEY SAY THE SPIRITS OF THOSE
LOVERS ARE STILL HERE.

200
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,333
THEY HELP
OTHER YOUNG LOVERS.

201
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,583
IF A COUPLE PLEDGES
THEIR LOVE IN THIS HOUSE,

202
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:48,083
THAT LOVE LASTS FOREVER,
EVEN BEYOND THE GRAVE.

203
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,708
- THAT'S ROMANTIC.
EVERLASTING LOVE?

204
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,958
- EXACTLY.  NOW YOU KNOW
WHY THIS PLACE IS CALLED

205
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,958
THE HOUSE
OF THE ETERNAL PLEDGE.

206
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,458
THIS LEGEND IS KNOWN
AROUND THE WORLD,

207
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,958
SO MANY YOUNG LOVERS COME
LOOKING FOR THIS MANSION.

208
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,791
BUT MOST BECOME
HOPELESSLY LOST.

209
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,625
THAT IS WHY IT IS ALSO KNOWN
AS THE HOUSE OF ILLUSION.

210
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,458
YOU ARE FORTUNATE
TO HAVE FOUND IT.

211
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,666
THAT MEANS YOU ARE DESTINED
TO BE TOGETHER.

212
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,041
- WHAT?

213
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,625
- NOW IT'S TIME TO PART.
WE'LL MEET AGAIN SHORTLY.

214
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,333
- ( exclaims )

215
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,500
- SAKUYA.  WHOA.

216
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,708
- TENCHI, HELP.
- I'M TRYING, SAKUYA.

217
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,083
- WHOA.

218
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,625
- ( chuckles )

219
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,833
- MEOW.

220
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,625
- RYO-OHKI.

221
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,833
- Ryoko: IF WE COULD JUST GET
THROUGH THE DIMENSION TUNNEL.

222
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,333
RYO-OHKI'S ALMOST THERE.

223
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,958
- Ayeka: THERE'S NO CHOICE.
- HUH?

224
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:47,666
- ( cackles )

225
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,541
- MEOW!

226
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,166
- YES!

227
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,541
- Ryoko: WE BROKE THROUGH.
NOW WE'VE GOT TO FIND TENCHI.

228
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,125
GO ON, RYO-OHKI.
WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU, BABE.

229
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,541
- THAT'S RIGHT, RYO-OHKI.
LEAD US TO LORD TENCHI.

230
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,750
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.
- MEOW!

231
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,500
- THAT'S STRANGE,
RYOKO.

232
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,458
DID YOU NOTICE HOW QUIET
IT GOT ALL OF A SUDDEN?

233
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,250
- RYO-OHKI, HURRY.
WHERE HAS TENCHI GONE?

234
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,958
- ( sniffs )

235
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,666
MEOW.

236
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,250
- IT'S THAT WAY.

237
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,583
- HMM?

238
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,125
- WHOA, THIS FOG
IS SO STRANGE.

239
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,208
- TENCHI?
- WHA--?  HUH?

240
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,166
SAKUYA, YOU'RE DRESSED
LIKE A BRIDE.

241
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,583
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

242
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,000
- WELL, LOOK AT THE WAY
YOU'RE DRESSED, TENCHI.

243
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:08,541
- UH, MR. HOTSUMA,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

244
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,666
- WELL, THE PARTY
I TOLD YOU ABOUT

245
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,333
IS FOR YOUR WEDDING.

246
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,958
LOOK, YOUR LOVELY BRIDE
IS WAITING FOR YOU.

247
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,416
- AH!
- A WEDDING?  HOLD ON A MINUTE.

248
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,458
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU,

249
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,041
YOU WOULD NOT HAVE FOUND
THE HOUSE OF THE ETERNAL PLEDGE

250
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,875
IF YOU WERE NOT DESTINED
FOR EACH OTHER.

251
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,291
IF YOU SWEAR YOUR LOVE
TO EACH OTHER NOW,

252
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,791
IT WILL BE EVERLASTING.
YOU AND SAKUYA

253
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,708
WILL BE TOGETHER FOREVER,
EVEN BEYOND THE GRAVE.

254
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:40,083
- WHERE ARE WE?
I CAN FEEL THE EARTH SHIFTING.

255
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,625
- ALL I SEE IS FOG,
NO MATTER WHICH WAY I TURN.

256
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,625
AND IT'S GETTING
MUCH THICKER.

257
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:47,750
THERE'S AN EVIL PRESENCE OUT
THERE, AND I CAN FEEL IT, RYOKO.

258
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,958
- YOU'RE RIGHT, AYEKA,
AND I DON'T LIKE IT.

259
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,458
- MEOW, MEOW!

260
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,875
- AH, TENCHI'S
THAT WAY.

261
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,250
- NOW LET US BEGIN
THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY.

262
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,833
SINCE YOU'RE IN THE HOUSE
OF THE ETERNAL PLEDGE,

263
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,416
YOU NEED ONLY PLEDGE
YOUR DEVOTION TO EACH OTHER,

264
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,708
AND EVERLASTING LOVE
WILL BE YOURS.

265
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,958
YOU WILL BE TOGETHER FOREVER
AND EVER, YOUNG LOVERS.

266
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,000
- AH, TENCHI.

267
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,041
- YES, SAKUYA?

268
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,541
- Hotsuma: NOW TO BEGIN.
DO YOU, SAKUYA KUMASHIRO,

269
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:28,000
PLEDGE TO LOVE YOUR BRIDEGROOM
TENCHI MASAKI

270
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,541
TILL DEATH
DO YOU PART?

271
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,916
- I DO.

272
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,791
- AND NOW, DO YOU,
TENCHI MASAKI,

273
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,291
PLEDGE TO LOVE YOUR BRIDE
SAKUYA KUMASHIRO

274
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,833
TILL DEATH
DO YOU PART?

275
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,916
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

276
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,458
SAKUYA AND I
BARELY KNOW EACH OTHER.

277
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,375
YOU BROUGHT US HERE
THROUGH SOME KIND OF MAGIC,

278
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,708
AND I WANT YOU
TO LET US GO.

279
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:51,166
- YOU MUST PLEDGE
ETERNAL LOVE TO SAKUYA.

280
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,916
- NO, I WON'T.

281
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,083
HUH?

282
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,000
( moans )

283
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,083
- DO AS I SAY
AND PLEDGE YOUR LOVE.

284
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,750
- I, TENCHI MASAKI,

285
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,708
PLEDGE THAT I WILL LOVE
MY BRIDE...

286
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,083
- MEOW, MEOW, MEOW!

287
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,791
- TENCHI IS INSIDE
THAT HOUSE?

288
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:18,958
- MEOW!

289
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,125
- RIGHT!

290
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,333
( grunts )

291
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,083
- WHY DID YOU SMASH YOUR FACE
INTO THAT DOOR?

292
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,250
- I CAN'T
GET THROUGH IT.

293
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,666
- IT'S LOCKED UP TIGHT,
BUT WE'VE GOT TO GET INSIDE.

294
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,166
- STEP ASIDE, AYEKA.

295
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:39,958
HIYAH!

296
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:43,625
- HUH?

297
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,333
- ( exclaims )

298
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:50,791
- Ryoko: TENCHI,
ARE YOU THERE?

299
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,625
- LORD TENCHI?
- MEOW?

300
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,125
- AH, YOU'RE HERE,
YOU GUYS.

301
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,875
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME.
THANK GOODNESS.

302
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,458
- THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M SO GLAD I FOUND YOU.

303
00:17:58,541 --> 00:17:59,458
ARGH!

304
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,541
- TENCHI, LOOK AT YOU.

305
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,541
WHY ARE YOU DRESSED LIKE THAT?
JUST WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

306
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,708
OW!

307
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,000
TENCHI, YOU KNOW
YOU'VE GOT ME.

308
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,500
WHAT DO YOU NEED
THAT OTHER GIRL FOR?

309
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,916
SHE'S JUST
A LITTLE SCHEMER.

310
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,916
AND ANYWAY, SHE COULD
NEVER, EVER COMPARE TO ME.

311
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
YOU KNOW THAT.

312
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,583
- RYOKO, YOU'RE TWISTING
MY NECK.

313
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,208
- ( Sakuya exclaims )

314
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:16,791
- SAKUYA.

315
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,000
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS,
MR. HOTSUMA?

316
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,625
- I TOLD YOU, THIS IS THE HOUSE
OF THE ETERNAL PLEDGE.

317
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,708
THOSE WHO DO NOT PLEDGE
ETERNAL LOVE

318
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,458
WILL RECEIVE
ETERNAL AGONY.

319
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,500
( laughing )
- TENCHI, HELP.

320
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,875
- RYOKO, MISS AYEKA,
PLEASE HELP ME.

321
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,000
WE'VE GOT TO SAVE SAKUYA
FROM HIM NOW.

322
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,500
- YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING.

323
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,875
WHY WOULD I SAVE THAT
SCHEMING LITTLE ALLEY CAT?

324
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,291
- WHAT SHE SAID.

325
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,666
- COME ON, TENCHI,
DON'T BOTHER WITH THAT GIRL.

326
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,083
HOW ABOUT SPENDING THE NIGHT
IN TOWN ALONE WITH RYOKO?

327
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:46,000
I'LL SHOW YOU SOME OF MY
SPECIAL POWERS.  IT'LL BE GREAT.

328
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,375
- LET HER GO!

329
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:53,166
- SHE'S MINE.
I'M TAKING SAKUYA WITH ME.

330
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,375
AND FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
YOU WILL REGRET

331
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,583
THAT YOU DID NOT PLEDGE
ETERNAL LOVE TO HER.

332
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,416
- ( screams )

333
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,666
- OH, MY POOR TENCHI.
- ( moaning )

334
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,083
- PLEASE DON'T BE HURT.

335
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,583
- ( Sakuya exclaims )
- ( Hotsuma grunts )

336
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,666
- YOU DARE TO ATTACK
MY TENCHI?

337
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,666
YOU JUST MADE
A BIG MISTAKE, FELLA.

338
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,916
- WHOEVER YOU ARE,
I SIMPLY CANNOT ALLOW YOU

339
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,500
TO BRING ANY HARM
TO LORD TENCHI.

340
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,958
YOU HAVE NOW BEEN WARNED.
- MEOW!

341
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,083
- SILENCE!

342
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,833
- HANDS OFF TENCHI!

343
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,458
HA!  YOU GOT
WHAT YOU DESERVED.

344
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,583
- AH, TENCHI?

345
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,666
- WHA--?
- ( yells )

346
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,750
- ( both grunting )

347
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,625
- IT'S FANTASTIC.
WOW.

348
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,625
- WELL, YOU'VE GOT
SOME PRETTY GOOD MOVES.

349
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,416
- YOU'RE NOT BAD
EITHER.

350
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,458
- ( yells )

351
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,416
( gasps )

352
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,375
- ( chuckles )

353
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,750
WELL, WELL,
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

354
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,541
- IT'S RYOKO.
AND WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

355
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:21,791
- HOTSUMA.

356
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,791
I LIKE YOU,
BUT UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T STAY.

357
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,375
COME BACK AGAIN AND WE WILL
SETTLE THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL.

358
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,250
- HOTSUMA, HUH?

359
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,375
HMM.

360
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:37,250
- LORD TENCHI, I WAS SO WORRIED
HE MIGHT HAVE HURT YOU.

361
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,541
- MEOW.

362
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,041
- TENCHI, ARE YOU OKAY?

363
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,125
- YEAH, I'M FINE.
THANKS A LOT, RYOKO.

364
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,041
- THIS IS SO AMAZING.

365
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:47,291
THEY'RE REAL SORCERERS
AND THEY'RE YOUR FRIENDS?

366
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,750
AHH.

367
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,333

374
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,375
OH, I SHOULD INTRODUCE
MYSELF TO YOU.

375
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,291
I AM SAKUYA KUMASHIRO.

376
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,541
THANK YOU SO MUCH

382
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:23,500

HUH?  YOU NEED
SOME MONEY

395
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:17,750
AND YOU WANT ME
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT?

396
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:20,125
NO WAY.
THAT'S TOO MUCH TO ASK,

397
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:24,125
EVEN FROM AN AMAZINGLY
BRILLIANT SCIENTIST LIKE ME.

398
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:26,291
I CAN GIVE YOU SOME
TERRIFIC ADVICE THOUGH.

399
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:29,333
MAKE YOUR WAY TO TOKYO
AND FIND A PART-TIME JOB THERE.

400
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:32,125
WORK REALLY HARD, AND YOU CAN
EARN ALL THE MONEY YOU NEED.

401
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:35,875
