1
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,958
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,958
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:05,791
- SASAMI, STAY HERE WITH ME.

4
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,708
I DON'T NEED ANYTHING ELSE.

5
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:11,250
PEOPLE, TOWNS, THE OCEAN,
THE SKY, AND THE STARS.

6
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:14,083
I DON'T NEED ANY OF THEM
IF YOU ARE HERE.

7
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,916
COME ON-- LET'S MAKE THIS
A SPECIAL WORLD,

8
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,291
JUST FOR YOU AND ME.

9
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,041
- ( engine starts )

10
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,041
- ( ground cracking )

11
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:26,625
- HOW CAN I ASK THEM FOR HELP?
HOW CAN I EVEN FACE THEM?

12
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:29,875
I FELL FOR YUGI'S TRICKS.
I CAUSED THIS MESS,

13
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:33,750
AYEKA, FOR YOKO AND
EVERYONE ELSE. EVEN SASAMI.

14
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:36,541
THEY'RE ALL IN TROUBLE
BECAUSE OF ME.

15
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,541
- ( music playing )

16
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,916
- TENCHI.

17
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,541
- ( meows )

18
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,333
- ( engine rumbles )

19
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:22,750
- ( laughter )

20
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,250
- YUGI.

21
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,791
- AHH!

22
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,583
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

23
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,583
OVERWHELMED BY THE SIGHT
OF SO MANY GORGEOUS WOMEN

24
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,166
IN THE SAME PLACE
AT THE SAME TIME?

25
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,916
- OH, YUGI.

26
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,125
- LOOK AT THESE GEMS, YUGI.

27
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,125
TENCHI'S GOT HIS FAMILY
BACK TOGETHER,

28
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,625
AND WHEN THESE GEMS ARE TOGETHER
THEIR POWER IS AWESOME.

29
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,791
- OH, YOU MEAN THOSE GEMS
BROUGHT US HERE?

30
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,250
- THAT'S RIGHT.

31
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,500
YUGI BROKE US APART TO WEAKEN
THE EARTH'S DEFENSES.

32
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,416
HER DREAM WAS
TO BUILD HER OWN EMPIRE

33
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,250
AND SHE USED
A CUNNING PLAN TO DO IT.

34
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,791
BUT IT'S ALL OVER NOW, YUGI.

35
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,958
- BUT WHY WOULD YOU WANNA DO
SUCH A MEAN THING, YUGI?

36
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:01,250
- GOOD QUESTION. IT LOOKS LIKE
SHE'S TOTALLY SPEECHLESS.

37
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,625
SAY SOMETHING, YUGI.
ADMIT THAT YOU ARE DEFEATED.

38
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,125
- I DON'T GET IT.

39
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:10,875
- WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME,
SASAMI?

40
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,000
- ( sighs )

41
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,666
- I LIKE YOU SO MUCH.
YOU KNOW THAT.

42
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,000
HOW COULD YOU
ABANDON ME LIKE THAT?

43
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,958
- SOUNDS LIKE HER BRAIN'S
GONE OUT OF WHACK.

44
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,000
- COME BACK TO ME,
PLEASE, SASAMI.

45
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,333
- YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

46
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,833
YOU THINK I'D LET
A SHE-DEMON LIKE YOU

47
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,500
TAKE MY LITTLE SISTER AWAY?
NEVER!

48
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,625
- YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO EVER SMILED AT ME, SASAMI.

49
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,625
THE ONLY FRIEND I EVER HAD.

50
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:35,416
I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU.
PLEASE!

51
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,666
- DO YOU REMEMBER THE TIME
YOU GOT ME THAT MUSIC BOX?

52
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,250
YOU WERE SO NICE.
- ( sighs )

53
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,083
- ( music box plays )

54
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,958
- IT'S YOURS IF YOU WANT IT.

55
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,833
- THANKS, YUKI.

56
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,166
- ( giggles )

57
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,333
- THAT'S WHY
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT

58
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,250
WHEN PEOPLE SAID
YOU WERE EVIL.

59
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:57,750
I DIDN'T WANT TO BELIEVE IT.

60
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,333
- I'LL GIVE YOU MUSIC BOXES
IF YOU WANT THEM.

61
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:03,416
I'LL GIVE YOU A WHOLE WORLD OF
WONDERFUL THINGS, JUST FOR YOU.

62
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,208
- UH-UH!
I DON'T WANT THINGS.

63
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,041
I WANT A REAL FRIEND
WITH A GOOD HEART.

64
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,708
YOU HAVE TO START
BEING KIND, YUGI.

65
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,333
- I AM.

66
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,875
I'M CREATING A SPECIAL WORLD
THAT'S JUST FOR YOU AND ME.

67
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,541
- I DON'T WANNA LIVE
IN ANOTHER WORLD.

68
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,500
I WANNA LIVE HERE
WITH MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

69
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,750
YOU HAVE TO GIVE UP
THESE AWFUL PLANS.

70
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,541
I WANT YOU TO MAKE PEACE
WITH EVERYONE, PLEASE.

71
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,458
- YOU WILL COME HERE NOW.

72
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:26,250
YOU CAN LIVE FOREVER.
LISTEN TO ME.

73
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:29,375
- ( ice crackling )

74
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:34,083
- SASAMI, LISTEN TO MY VOICE.
COME TO ME NOW.

75
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,125
- SASAMI?
- ( giggles )

76
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,541
I NEVER THOUGHT
YOU COULD BE SO MEAN.

77
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,916
YOU'RE BAD.
- ( gasps )

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,375
- LISTEN TO ME.

79
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:47,583
LOOK, THERE'S NOTHING
LEFT FOR YOU-- FOR ANYONE.

80
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,250
IF YOU DON'T CHANGE THINGS
BACK THE WAY THEY WERE,

81
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,291
HOW CAN I LIKE YOU ANYMORE?

82
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,666
I'M GONNA END UP
HATING YOU, YUGI.

83
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,875
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

84
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,958
- HA! WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.

85
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,000
COME ON, LET'S JUST
FINISH THEM ALL OFF, YUGI.

86
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,000
YUGI?

87
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:08,291
- THAT'S ENOUGH.
YOU ARE OFFICIALLY TERMINATED.

88
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,750
- ( gasps )
- OH!

89
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:11,875
- ( screams )

90
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,250
- SASAMI.

91
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:16,083
- I WAS LYING TO YOU
ALL ALONG, SASAMI.

92
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,708
I NEVER LIKED YOU.

93
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:20,416
I DON'T WANT ANY SNIVELING
LITTLE FRIENDS.

94
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,208
ALL OF YOU JUST DIE!

95
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,333
- ( all gasp )

96
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,166
- ( warbling explosion )

97
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,500
- TENCHI.
TENCHI.

98
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,541
- ( murmurs )

99
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,791
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- YES, WE'RE ALL OKAY.

100
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,791
- THAT'S NOT BAD AT ALL.

101
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,250
- YEAH, YOU CAN SEE
YUGI'S NEW WORLD ORDER.

102
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,333
- HUH?

103
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,333
- IT'S ALL TURNED EVIL
AND DARK.

104
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,625
- IT MUST BE REFLECTING
YUGI'S TRUE NATURE.

105
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,958
- BELIEVE ME. I'M NOT LETTING
HER OFF THE HOOK NOW.

106
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,458
SHE TOYED WITH US LIKE
WE WERE HER LITTLE PUPPETS.

107
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:07,000
IT'S PAYBACK TIME, EVERYONE.
- RYOKO, WAIT.

108
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,750
- HUH?
WHAT IS IT?

109
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:13,666
- I KNOW I DON'T HAVE
THE RIGHT TO ASK YOU THIS...

110
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,958
BUT I WANNA TAKE YUGI ON
BY MYSELF.

111
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,083
THIS WAS MY FAULT
FROM THE BEGINNING.

112
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:22,250
I FELL FOR YUGI'S TRICKS
AND THAT HURT EVERYONE.

113
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,333
THIS IS MY ONLY CHANCE
TO MAKE IT RIGHT.

114
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,291
- TENCHI.
- LORD TENCHI.

115
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,083
- IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.
YUGI ALMOST DESTROYED YOUR EYE.

116
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,500
SHE'S A MEGA POWERFUL MUTANT.

117
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,625
NO HUMAN COULD POSSIBLY
DEFEAT HER.

118
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:36,250
YOU'VE GOT TO LET US TAKE CARE
OF THIS CRISIS, LORD TENCHI.

119
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,666
- EVERYONE GIVE ME YOUR GEMS
AND PLEASE STAND ASIDE.

120
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,625
- NOW WHAT'S THIS? 

121
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:45,166
- ( laser whooshes )

122
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,833
- ( clicks )

123
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:50,541
- YOU'RE GONNA USE IT?
THE ULTIMATE POWER?

124
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,041
- OH.
- THIS IS GREAT.

125
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:56,083
NOW WE CAN FINALLY SEE
WHAT THESE POWER GEMS CAN DO.

126
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,625
COME ON, EVERYONE.
HAND THEM OVER.

127
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,125
- HERE, TENCHI.
- HERE'S MINE.

128
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,458
- ALL RIGHT.

129
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,500
THIS THING FINALLY GOT
YOUR BLOOD UP, EH, TENCHI?

130
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:11,208
WELL, I'M WITH YOU, BABE.
GO GET HER.

131
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,208
- THIS IS NO JOKE, RYOKO.

132
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:16,208
YOUR ATTITUDE
IS SIMPLY IRRESPONSIBLE. OOH!

133
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,541
- I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
SO DECISIVE BEFORE, TENCHI.

134
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:19,958
IT REALLY GETS ME GOING.

135
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,041
WHATEVER YOU DECIDE TO DO
IS OKAY WITH ME.

136
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,791
AND REMEMBER, A PART OF ME
WILL BE RIGHT THERE WITH YOU.

137
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,250
- ( groans )
- ( struggles )

138
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,333
- AAH!
- ( grunts )

139
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,458
- TENCHI, SWEETHEART,

140
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,125
PLEASE DON'T PUT
YOURSELF IN DANGER.

141
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,250
- I THINK I KNOW MY LIMITS.

142
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,625
- ( boinging )
- TENCHI!

143
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,750
- I WANNA TELL YOU
YUGI WAS MY FRIEND,

144
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,583
AND SHE WAS REALLY NICE.

145
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,250
I KNOW THERE'S STILL
A GOOD PERSON

146
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,333
SOMEWHERE DEEP INSIDE OF HER.

147
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,125
I HOPE YOU DON'T HAVE
TO HURT HER.

148
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,708
- ( distant fighting )
- ( slight gasp )

149
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,500
- ( crystals
lightly clang )

150
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:58,250
- ( whooshing )

151
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,541
- ( all gasp )

152
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,250
- ( loud footsteps )

153
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,041
- DID YOU SEE THAT?
HE'S ON FIRE.

154
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,791
I'M FALLING IN LOVE
ALL OVER AGAIN.

155
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,791
THAT'S WHAT I CALL
A REAL MAN.

156
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,083
- PLEASE BE CAREFUL.

157
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:20,500
RYOKO, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- I'M GONNA FOLLOW HIM.

158
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:21,958
YOU DON'T THINK
I'M STAYING HERE, DO YOU?

159
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,666
- BUT YOU HEARD HIM.
HE WANTS TO DO THIS ALONE.

160
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,458
- AND I KNOW WHAT I WANT.
- UH!

161
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:29,333
- I WANT TO BE WITH TENCHI,
NOW, ALWAYS.

162
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,625
THAT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT MAKES ME HAPPY.

163
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,125
IT HAS TO BE HIM.

164
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,791
I DON'T KNOW HOW HE FEELS,
BUT I KNOW HOW I FEEL.

165
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,458
AND THAT'S WHAT COUNTS.

166
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,666
THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO FOLLOW HIM
NOW. YOU THINK THAT'S SILLY?

167
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,250
- NO, BUT YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY
ONE WHO FEELS THAT WAY.

168
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,791
- MIHOSHI, WE'RE GOING TOO.
- OKAY.

169
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,333
- ( inspirational music plays )

170
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,500
- ( wind rushes )

171
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:58,500
- GET BACK. GO AWAY.
JUST LEAVE ME BE.

172
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,500
- ( growls )

173
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,458
- AGH!
( groans )

174
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,500
- RYOKO.
- STILL YOUR MISSION.

175
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,750
DON'T WORRY. I'M JUST KIND OF
CLEARING THE WAY.

176
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,416
- ( growls )

177
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,375
- KIYONE AND MIHOSHI TOO?

178
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,166
- WE'VE GOT YOUR BACK COVERED.

179
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,166
- ACTUALLY, I'M NOT FEELING
QUITE MYSELF TODAY.

180
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,750
- TENCHI, OVER HERE.
PLEASE HURRY UP.

181
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,500
COME ON. HURRY UP.
THE PASSAGE IS CLOSING.

182
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,833
- GOT IT.

183
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,083
- I WISH I COULD DO
SOMETHING TO HELP.

184
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,500
- I THINK YOU'VE ALREADY HELPED
IN YOUR OWN WAY, SASAMI.

185
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,958
- ( gasps )
OUR CASTLE.

186
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,208
IT'S DISAPPEARING.
WHAT'S SHE DOING?

187
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:41,375
- SHE'S PULLING BACK IN HER
SHELL. A NATURAL REACTION.

188
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,250
WE'LL HAVE TO FIND
A WAY TO BREAK THROUGH.

189
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,041
- GO, TENCHI, YOU CAN DO IT.
- BUT WHAT HAPPENS

190
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,791
WHEN YOU GET THERE?
WHAT WILL YOU DO?

191
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,083
HEY, TENCHI?

192
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,041
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TENCHI
MAY NOT FIGHT AGAINST HER?

193
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:57,708
HE HAS TO. AS A PLANET GUARDIAN,
HE MUST PROTECT THE PLANET.

194
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,125
HOW CAN HE DO THAT
UNLESS HE FIGHTS HER?

195
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,666
- TENCHI'S ALWAYS BEEN
VERY GENTLE. IT'S HIS NATURE.

196
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,083
HE JUST DOESN'T LIKE
TO HURT ANYONE.

197
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,875
YET HE'S A SUPERB GUARDIAN.

198
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,500
YOU SEE, HE FIND WAYS TO PROTECT
THE EARTH WITHOUT FIGHTING.

199
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,708
- HOW CAN HE DO THAT?
- THINK ABOUT IT, WASHU.

200
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,041
HAVEN'T YOU EVER WONDERED HOW
SIX OF YOU FROM OUTER SPACE--

201
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,750
INCLUDING A NOTORIOUS PIRATE,
A RENEGADE GENIUS,

202
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,541
AND ALL THE OTHERS ENDED UP

203
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,708
AT A TINY SHINTO SHRINE
IN NOKIYAMA?

204
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,625
- I SUPPOSE WE ALL KNOW
IT'S MORE THAN A COINCIDENCE.

205
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:27,583
SOMEHOW TENCHI DREW US ALL TO
HIM WITHOUT EVEN REALLY TRYING.

206
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,375
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
ISN'T IT?

207
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,250
- WHEN SOMEONE POSES
A THREAT TO THIS PLANET,

208
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,416
TENCHI TAKES THEM IN
AND KEEPS THEM CLOSE.

209
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,541
LIVING WITH THEM PEACEFULLY.
AND AFTER A WHILE,

210
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,083
THESE VILLAINS JUST GIVE UP.

211
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,583
TENCHI KNOWS THAT FIGHTING
ONLY LEADS TO MORE FIGHTING.

212
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,875
SO HE FINDS OTHER WAYS.

213
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,583
- I SEE.
THAT MAKES SENSE.

214
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,458
- I SUPPOSE VILLAIN
WAS A HARSH WORD.

215
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,125
I DIDN'T MEAN TO OFFEND YOU.

216
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,875
- NO. NOT AT ALL.
IT'S TRUE ANY ONE OF US

217
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,291
COULD SNAP ONE DAY
AND VAPORIZE A PLANET OR TWO.

218
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,791
MYSELF INCLUDED, OF COURSE.
- WELL, IT'S NOT OUR PLACE

219
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,583
TO JUDGE YOU, IN ANY CASE.

220
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,541
OUR MISSION
IS TO PROTECT THIS PLANET.

221
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,666
NOTHING MORE.
- PULLING THE FANGS OFF DEMONS

222
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,958
AND PURIFYING THEIR HEARTS
IS QUITE A TRICK.

223
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,625
AND WITH NO VIOLENCE,
HE'S DOING PRETTY GOOD.

224
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,166
- UNTIL NOW IT'S ALL BEEN
HIS NATURAL INSTINCTS.

225
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,000
HE'S NOT TRAINED.
- THAT MAY BE HIS WEAK POINT.

226
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,125
THIS TIME
IT'S DIFFERENT, TENCHI.

227
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,458
YOU CAN'T STOP HER
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

228
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,458
YOU MAY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT
TO USE THE SWORD AGAINST HER.

229
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,458
- ( dramatic music plays )

230
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,708
- ALL RIGHT, TENCHI.
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'RE MADE OF.

231
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,041
THIS IS THE TEST.

232
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,166
- ( running footsteps )

233
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:38,041
- MEOW.

234
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,583
- MEOW.

235
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:50,541
- ( rollicking water )

236
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,375
- GET BACK!

237
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,541
STAY AWAY!

238
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,333
( roars )

239
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,791
( shouts )

240
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,500
- ( grunting )

241
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:10,875
- ( murmurs )

242
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,333
- ( roars )

243
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:19,375
- AHH!

244
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:22,125
- ( ships whooshing )

245
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,875
- THOSE THINGS
JUST KEEP COMING.

246
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,583
- OKAY, TENCHI.
HIT IT.

247
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,291
- RIGHT.
THANKS FOR COVERING ME.

248
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,208
- TENCHI, I FOUND THE GATE.

249
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,958
THAT'S GOT TO BE THE ENTRANCE
TO THE INNER SANCTUM.

250
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,375
- STAY OUT.

251
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,333
- ( gates booming )

252
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,750
- ( rocks crackling )

253
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,708
- OPEN IT.
- LET ME AT HER.

254
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,708
HA!

255
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,625
( groaning )

256
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,541
- RYOKO!
- ( grunts )

257
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:03,458
YOU CAN'T STOP ME.
YUGI!

258
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:07,458
- ( explosions boom )

259
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,083
- AH!
( whimpers )

260
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,708
- RYOKO, ARE YOU OKAY?

261
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,000
- OF COURSE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

262
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,333
IT'S ALL CLEAR.

263
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,083
I KNOW YOU WANNA DO
THIS YOURSELF, TENCHI,

264
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,125
SO GO ON AHEAD.

265
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,125
- ( soft music plays )

266
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:25,625
- MM.

267
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,541
- GOOD LUCK, TENCHI.

268
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,750
- ( running footsteps )

269
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,708
- ( grunting )

270
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,625
- YUGI!

271
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,000
- ( grunts )

272
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,250
- ARE YOU GONNA
LOCK ME UP AGAIN?

273
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:53,041
PLEASE DON'T.
I CAN'T TAKE IT.

274
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,625
I DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

275
00:14:55,708 --> 00:15:00,000
WHAT DID I DO TO YOU?
STOP. DON'T COME NEAR ME.

276
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,708
PLEASE. I DON'T WANNA
BE ALONE IN THE DARK.

277
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,666
- GIVE IT UP.
YOU'RE FINISHED.

278
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,250
- I DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE!

279
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:10,000
- ( explosion booms )

280
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,708
- OH MY!

281
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,625
- THE TIME HAS COME.

282
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,083
- ( wind rushing )

283
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,166
- ( laser warbles )

284
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,625
- ( groans )
STAY BACK.

285
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,166
I'M TELLING YOU!
NO. STAY AWAY.

286
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,166
LEAVE ME ALONE.
LEAVE ME ALONE. LEAVE ME ALONE!

287
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:37,000
( screams, groans )

288
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,958
( sobs )

289
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:44,375
- NO MATTER HOW
SAD OR LONELY YOU FEEL,

290
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:47,458
THIS IS NO WAY
TO SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM.

291
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,500
- ( sighs )
- ANYWAY...

292
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,375
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU'RE ALL
ALONE IN THE WORLD, YUGI?

293
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,166
EVERYONE
FEELS LONELY SOMETIMES.

294
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,125
BUT HEY-- YOU SHOULD HAVE
JUST COME OVER

295
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,541
TO OUR PLACE.
YOU KNOW?

296
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,750
- THEY LEFT ME ALL ALONE
IN THAT DARK PLACE.

297
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,708
IT WAS SCARY.

298
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,666
AND I WAS THERE
FOR SO LONG.

299
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,708
I... I JUST WANT TO BE
WITH SASAMI NOW.

300
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,708
I DON'T WANT TO BE
ALONE ANYMORE.

301
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:17,750
( sobs, sniffles )

302
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,916
- COME WITH US THEN.
TO OUR HOME.

303
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,333
IT'LL BE YOUR HOME TOO.
- TENCHI, YOU DID IT.

304
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:32,458
- WHO ELSE WOULD EVEN THINK
OF DOING THAT?

305
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,500
- I FEEL SLEEPY.
- HUH?

306
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:39,291
- I WAS TRYING SO HARD
FOR SUCH A LONG TIME.

307
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,708
NOW I'M JUST TIRED.

308
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,791
- WELL, YOU CAN REST NOW.

309
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,750
YOU'RE SAFE WITH US.

310
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,750
- OH, LOOK.
THE SUN'S ALREADY UP.

311
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,000
- ( bird chirps )

312
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,375
- HEY, HOW'S IT GOING, TENCHI?

313
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,833
AMAGASAKI, THE GIRLS AND I
WERE ALL SURPRISED

314
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,541
WHEN WE HEARD
YOU'D GONE BACK TO OKIYAMA.

315
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:03,791
IT HAPPENED SO FAST,

316
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,833
AND RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF SUMMER VACATION.

317
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,083
WELL, EVEN THOUGH YOU WERE ONLY
HERE FOR ONE SEMESTER

318
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,250
WE HAD SOME GOOD TIMES
TOGETHER, DIDN'T WE?

319
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,125
SO ANYWAY, NEXT TIME YOU'RE
IN THE AREA GIVE A CALL.

320
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,916
AND DON'T FORGET TO DROP BY
MY GRANDFATHER'S SHRINE. OKAY?

321
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,166
( in girlish voice, giggles)
FROM YOUR GIRLFRIEND IN TOKYO.

322
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,958
- THOSE GUYS ARE SUCH JOKERS.

323
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,333
- UGH. I'M NOT SAYING A WORD.
FORGET IT.

324
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,916
( grunting )
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO GOSSIP

325
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
ABOUT MY OWN SON'S
PRIVATE LIFE.

326
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,583
IT'S IMMORAL. UNETHICAL.
MAYBE ILLEGAL.

327
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:34,541
YOU GIRLS ARE SHAMELESS.
WHERE'S YOUR SENSE OF DECENCY?

328
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,916
I'M NOT A STOOL PIGEON,
AND THAT'S THAT.

329
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,833
- LOOK ME IN THE EYE
AND SAY THAT.

330
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:39,958
- ( growls )

331
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,000
- STOP IT.
BOTH OF YOU.

332
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,958
DOES IT REALLY MATTER
WHO THAT LETTER WAS FROM?

333
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,833
ON SECOND THOUGHT,
MAYBE IT DOES MATTER.

334
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,166
I THINK YOU'D BETTER FESS UP,
FATHER.

335
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,958
OR AYEKA AND MYOKO
COULD GO BALLISTIC.

336
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,458
- MEOW.
- AHH!

337
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,291
NOW THIS IS TOTALLY
OFF THE RECORD.

338
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,125
- I KNEW HE WAS HOLDING OUT.

339
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,708
- I ONLY GLANCED AT THE CARD
BUT IT SAID...

340
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,416
"FROM YOUR GIRLFRIEND
IN TOKYO."

341
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,291
- ( explosion rumbles )

342
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,791
- ( echoing )
YOW!

343
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,208
MIHOSHI. KIYONE.
THOUGHT I WAS A GONER.

344
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,750
THANK YOU FOR SAVING ME.
I HATE-- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

345
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,833
- WE'RE GOING TO CRASH.
- IN ALL THE EXCITEMENT

346
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,250
I FORGOT TO DO
A MAINTENANCE CHECK.

347
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,083
- OHH!

348
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,500
- CALL TENCHI.
- TENCHI.

349
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,791
- HOW MANY GIRLFRIENDS DID
YOU HAVE IN TOKYO, ANYWAY?

350
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,500
I THINK I HAVE A RIGHT
TO KNOW.

351
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,666
- All: YO, TENCHI!

352
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,083
- ( soft music playing )

353
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,458
- TODAY WAS AS CRAZY AS EVER.

354
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:39,958
I WISH YOU COULD HAVE
SHARED IT

355
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,375
'CAUSE WE HAD SO MUCH FUN.
I JUST LOVE EVERYONE HERE.

356
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:45,041
THEY'RE THE BEST FRIENDS
ANYBODY COULD HAVE.

357
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,708
SOME DAY, WHEN I'M
A LITTLE OLDER,

358
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,208
WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN.

359
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,041
AND I BET IT WILL BE
EVEN BETTER THAN BEFORE.

360
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,791
THE MORE THE MERRIER, RIGHT?

361
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,833
( giggles ) WELL,
THAT'S MY REPORT FOR TODAY.

362
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,041
GOOD NIGHT, YUGI.

363
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,416
I'LL TALK TO YOU
AGAIN TOMORROW, OKAY?

364
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,708
COME ON, RYO-OHKI.
LET'S GET DINNER READY. YEOW!

365
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,833
- SO MUCH HAS HAPPENED, HUH?
- YEAH.

366
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,583
- Ryoko:
YOU'VE BEEN AMAZING, TENCHI.

367
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,000
- YOU THINK THIS
WAS THE BEST SOLUTION?

368
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:19,666
- I THINK IT WAS BRILLIANT.
- I STILL WONDER.

369
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,875
- LOOK, YUGI COULDN'T HAVE
STAYED IN THIS WORLD

370
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,458
THE WAY SHE IS NOW, RIGHT?

371
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:26,083
- MAYBE WASHU COULD
HAVE FIGURED SOMETHING OUT.

372
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,750
YOU KNOW,
SOMETHING SCIENTIFIC?

373
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,541
- THIS WAS YUGI'S DECISION.
SHE CHOSE TO STAY ASLEEP

374
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,541
UNTIL SHE GROWS UP
INTO A BETTER PERSON.

375
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,583
HEY, TENCHI?

376
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:35,750
- HUH?

377
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,125
- SAKUYA WAS
A SHADOW OF YUGI, RIGHT?

378
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:41,041
SO DOESN'T THAT MEAN YUGI
WILL TURN INTO SAKUYA

379
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,208
WHEN SHE GROWS UP?
- I DON'T KNOW.

380
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,916
- WHAT IF SHE DOES? WHAT ARE
YOU GOING TO DO, TENCHI?

381
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,500
- I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
- ( laughs )

382
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,000
OH, DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I'M NOT JEALOUS OF HER.

383
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,458
SO YOU HAD A FLING.
I'M A GROWN-UP WOMAN.

384
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:57,416
I CAN HANDLE IT. HA.
AFTER ALL, THESE THINGS HAPPEN.

385
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,708
IT'S NATURAL.

386
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,125
- I'M GLAD YOU HAVE
A GOOD ATTITUDE ABOUT IT.

387
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,541
- ( booming rumble )

388
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:04,958
- I WAS TOTALLY LYING.

389
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,541
I CAN'T BEAR
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

390
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,041
I NEED YOU TO KISS ME NOW.

391
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,083
YOU DON'T THINK
I'M GOOD ENOUGH?

392
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,291
- ( loud chirping )
- OOH!

393
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,291
- WHOA
- AAH!

394
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:21,375
- NOW THIS IS IT.

395
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,625
I JUST CREATED
A NEW DIMENSION TUNNEL

396
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:25,958
AND THIS IS WHERE IT COMES OUT.
VERY INTRIGUING.

397
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,041
- HOLD ON, WASHU.
- ( groaning )

398
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:31,083
- AH. YOU JUST RUINED
MY MOMENT WITH TENCHI.

399
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,583
- I WAS DOING
AN EXPERIMENT.

400
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:33,916
DON'T YOU CARE
ABOUT SCIENCE?

401
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,250
- OH, DINNER'S GETTING COLD.
- OH, HI, TENCHI.

402
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,125
HEY, QUIT IT. STOP BEING
SUCH A RUFFIAN, RYOKO.

403
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,125
- YOU'RE ALL RUINING MY MOMENT.
- AHH.

404
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,291
- WE'RE TOTALLY BROKE.

405
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,125
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY
OUR SHARE.

406
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,125
- YEAH, BUT CAN WE
STAY FOR DINNER ANYWAY?

407
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:50,333
- HMM. I THINK SO.
( chuckles )

408
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,750
- ( overlapping arguing )

409
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,166
- ( soft music plays )

410
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:03,000
- I WONDER HOW TENCHI'S DOING
BACK IN OKIYAMA.

411
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,250
- PROBABLY LIVING
A NICE, PEACEFUL LIFE.

412
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,416
- ( chuckles )

413
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,791
- SHOULD WE WRITE
THE GUY ANOTHER LETTER?

414
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:08,958
- MM- HMM.
- HUH?

415
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,458
- WE SHOULD WRITE TENCHI TOO,
YOU THINK?

416
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,833
- YEAH. I REALLY MISS HIM.

417
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,750
- HEY, LET'S PLAY A JOKE
AND SEND HIM A LOVE LETTER.

418
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,708
- ( giggles )
- GOOD IDEA.

419
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:34,166
- ( overlapping chatter )

420
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:39,375
- ( meowing )

421
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:46,583
- ( theme music playing )

422
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:08,375
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

423
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:23,208
- ( man singing in Japanese )

424
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,375
- ( chorus singing in Japanese )

425
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:05,708
- ( meows )
