00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,083
- ( theme music plays )

00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:46,458
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:11,833
- ( explosion )

4
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:16,208
- ( Ryoko laughs ) 
- ( minions laugh )

5
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,375
- ( hollers )

6
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:18,916
- ( rattles )

7
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,708
- ( gulps )

8
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,041
AH.

9
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,916
- ( explosion )
- ( laughs )

10
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,458

00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:38,583
( laughter continues )

13
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:42,166
( sighs )
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH,

14
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,791
GOLD, JEWELS,
BEAUTIFUL DRESSES,

15
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,875
MORE SAKE THAN
I COULD EVER DRINK,

16
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,375
AND I FEEL EMPTY.

17
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,000
SOMETHING'S MISSING.

18
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,875
IT'S JUST NOT THE SAME
AS IT USED TO BE.

19
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,791
- AND NEXT
YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME

20
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,416
THAT IT'S TRUE LOVE
YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON.

21
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,583
- HA! YOU DON'T KNOW 
ME VERY WELL, DO YOU?

22
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,291
- HMM.

23
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:05,250
- HMM.

24
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,750
- WHERE'RE YOU GOING?

25
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,250
- I'M GOING OUT
FOR A WALK.

26
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,333
- OKAY, I'LL COME WITH YOU.

27
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,083
- LEAVE ME ALONE.

28
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,708
- GET OFF IT,
YOU SPOILED WENCH.

29
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,416
- News anchor: THESE MYSTERIOUS
GLOWING PHENOMENA 

30
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,250
HAVE BEEN SIGHTED AT
THREE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS

31
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,791
AROUND THE TOKYO AREA.

32
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,250
OUR INFORMED
SOURCES TELL US

33
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,625
THEY MAY BE A RESULT
OF PLASMIC DISTURBANCE

34
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:41,916
WITHIN THE GEO-SPHERE.

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,625
- UH, THAT SURE IS STRANGE.

36
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:46,166
- SPECULATION ABOUT--
- WHAT DO YOU THINK, SAKUYA?

37
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,333
- HEY, I KNOW.
LET'S HAVE BREAKFAST.

38
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,916
I'VE BEEN LEARNING
TO COOK HERE.

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,500
YOU KNOW, I HAD TO,
LIVING ALONE.

40
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:57,916
- STAY WITH ME.

41
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,625
PLEASE DON'T GO.

42
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,958
DON'T LEAVE ME ALL ALONE.

43
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,083
- ( thinking )
SHE'S BEEN LIKE THIS

44
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,083
EVER SINCE SHE CAME OVER
YESTERDAY.

45
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,791
I WONDER WHY.

46
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,541
IT'S NOT LIKE HER AT ALL.

47
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:26,083
- AH, THIS IS AN ENDLESS BATTLE.

48
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,000
WE NEED A BETTER SYSTEM
FOR GUARDING THE HOUSE,

49
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,666
WHICH MEANS MORE TRAPS.

50
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,000
( strains )

51
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,583
- ( chopping )
- ( bubbling )

52
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,250
- YUGI...

53
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,958
- ( sizzling )

54
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,333
- WORK, WORK, WORK.

55
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,625
THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH TIME.

56
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:52,083
YOU NEED TO PAY MORE ATTENTION
TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING, SASAMI. 

57
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,541
SASAMI.

58
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,708
WATCH YOUR FINGERS
WHILE YOU'RE CUTTING.

59
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,958
- OH.

60
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:02,125
- ( chopping resumes )

61
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,958
- ( computer beeps )

62
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:12,541
- THIS IS ASTONISHING.

63
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,208
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
THIS GEM HAD SO MUCH POTENTIAL?

64
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,208
TALK ABOUT A BIG SECRET, HUH?

65
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,416
AND THE NEXT STEP
OF MY RESEARCH

66
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,208
IS TO ANALYZE SAKUYA.

67
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,166
NOW, LET'S CHECK THE DATA.

68
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,708
AS THE GREATEST SCIENTIFIC
GENIUS IN THE UNIVERSE,

69
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,000
I'VE CREATED THIS DEVICE

70
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,083
TO DEMONSTRATE THE VALIDITY
OF MY HYPOTHESIS.

71
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,208
- I'LL CALL THIS 
SECOND GENERATION

72
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,375
REPORT BOY TYPE

73
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,375
ANALYTICA.

74
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,916
THIS WILL REVEAL
ALL YOUR SECRETS, SAKUYA.

75
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,583
- ( beeping )

76
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,833
- ANALYSIS, ANALYSIS.

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,625
- HOTSUMA COULD HAVE PICKED
A BETTER PLACE FOR A HIDEOUT.

78
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,250
THIS PLANET'S NOTHING
BUT SNOW AND MORE SNOW.

79
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,666
WELL, I GUESS IT HELPS

80
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,250
KEEP OUR BASE FROM
BEING DISCOVERED

81
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,625
SINCE NO ONE WOULD EVER
WANT TO COME HERE.

82
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,416
( grunts )

83
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,291
TRUE LOVE, HUH?

84
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,708
( laughs )

85
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,875
HMM, YA'!

86
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,916
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE.  YA'!

87
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,541
( grunts )

88
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:38,875
HA! ( laughs )

89
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,708
WHEW, A GIANT SNOWMAN.

90
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,875
NOW, SASAMI
WOULD LOVE THAT.

91
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,000
AND I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT MIHOSHI WOULD DO.

92
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,375
I CAN PICTURE
THE WHOLE THING.

93
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,541
WHAA! SPACE POLICE
POLICEMAN, HELP!

94
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,791
THE SNOWMAN'S
TRYING TO EAT ME.

95
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:53,791
( giggles )

96
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:57,208
( laughs )

97
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,166
WHY AM I THINKING 
ABOUT ALL OF THEM?

98
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,458
I'VE GOT TO GET
BACK TO THE BASE.

99
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,833
HOTSUMA FOUND THIS PLANET
AND SET UP OUR HIDEOUT.

100
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,166
I SHOULD SHOW MORE
APPRECIATION, I SUPPOSE.

101
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,666
IN FACT, HE'S DONE EVERYTHING
HE COULD DO FOR ME.

102
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,208
I'LL BE A LITTLE
NICER TO HIM.

103
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,166
( sneezes )

104
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,166
- ( clanging )

105
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,958
- ( shivers )
IT'S FREEZING IN HERE.

106
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,833
SOMEBODY OUGHT TO
TURN UP THE HEAT.

107
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,458
- Hotsuma: I THOUGHT I KNEW
WHAT I WAS GETTING INTO,

108
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,166
BUT I WASN'T READY
FOR THIS WITCH.

109
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,791
ALL SHE CARES ABOUT IS
MONEY, GETTING DRUNK,

110
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,916
AND WRECKING THINGS.

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,250
SHE'S A TOTAL ANIMAL.
WORSE, I THINK.

112
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,875
SHE STARTED
TO GROW ON ME,

113
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,750
BUT NOW ALL I SEE
IS A BARBARIAN.

114
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,750
I CAN HARDLY EVEN STAND
TO BE AROUND HER.

115
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,208
SHE DISGUSTS ME!

116
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,208
- HUH.

117
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,541
- SHE'S INSOLENT

118
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,375
AND I'M TIRED
OF DEALING WITH IT.

119
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,708
- ( gasps )

120
00:07:56,791 --> 00:08:01,208
( grunts and growls )

121
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:06,166
( strains and growls )

122
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,875
( sighs )

123
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,125
HMM.

124
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,041
YOU'RE JUST LIKE
ALL THE OTHERS. 

125
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,875
THEN AGAIN, I NEVER LIKED
YOU THAT MUCH, ANYWAY.

126
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:15,916
- WHO'S THERE?

127
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,541
WAS IT YOU, RYOKO?

128
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,375
- Yugi: SHE COULD
HAVE HEARD YOU.

129
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:29,083
( laughs ) WE'D BETTER
MOVE ON, DON'T YOU THINK?

130
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,916
- SHALL I ELIMINATE HER?  HMM?

131
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,333
- THAT WOULD BE WISE.

132
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,500
- ( chuckles )

133
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:42,083
- SAKUYA, I HAVE TO GO
TO MY PRACTICE SOON,

134
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,875
BUT I MADE US
A NICE BREAKFAST.

135
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,708
COME ON, CHECK IT OUT.
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

136
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,416
SAKUYA?

137
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,166
- WELL, I JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND THIS GIRL ANYMORE.

138
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,875
I GUESS, WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO TAKE HER OUT THEN.

139
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,583
TSUGARU, YOU CAN TAKE CARE
OF THE OTHERS, CAN'T YOU?

140
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,458
- OF COURSE.

141
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,500
- HMM.

142
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,041
- ( beeping )

143
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,375
DATA CAPTURE IN PROGRESS.

144
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,000
DATA CAPTURE COMPLETE.

145
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,958
( beeping )

146
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,791
- NICE GOING, ANALYTICA.

147
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,416
BRING THAT DATA
HOME TO MAMA.

148
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,166
WE'LL FIND OUT WHAT KIND 
OF GAME SAKUYA'S PLAYING.

149
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,000
- ( sighs )

150
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,625
( sputters )

151
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,666
( sighs )
THIS FEELS SO PERFECT.

152
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,416
IT'S TRUE THAT ALL
I EVER WANTED

153
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,125
WAS TO WREAK HAVOC.

154
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,291
AND YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT ME

155
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,458
DRINKING TOO MUCH 
AND BEING SELFISH,

156
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,541
BUT AT LEAST I'M UP-FRONT.

157
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,416
I DON'T SLINK AROUND
IN THE SHADOWS

158
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,708
AND SMEAR PEOPLE
AND STAB THEM IN THE BACK.

159
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:56,000
YOU LOWLIFE, AFTER
ALL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH!

160
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,708
( growls )

161
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,000
- AH, WHATEVER.

162
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,625
I JUST FEEL TERRIBLE.

163
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,583
OH, GEEZ, DO I LOOK
PATHETIC HERE OR WHAT?

164
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:42,625
HMM.

165
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,666
( echoes )
TENCHI.

166
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:02,458
SHOULD I GO BACK
TO OKAYAMA?

167
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,166
SO LONG, HOTSUMA.

168
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,916
GYAN, TRANSPORT BEAM.

169
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,291
- Minion:
YES, MA'AM.

170
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,041
- FAREWELL, RYOKO.

171
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,041
- ( gasps )

172
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,000
I FORGOT!

173
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,416
- ( explosions )

174
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,625
- SO MUCH FOR THE FAMOUS
PIRATE AND HER EGO.

175
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,041
- ( meows )

176
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,583
- ( meows )

177
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,875
- Kiyone: WE'RE NOW PASSING
THROUGH SATURN'S ORBIT.

178
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,833
EARTH IS JUST
AROUND THE CORNER.

179
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:10,000
THE PLAN IS GOING
PERFECTLY...

180
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,708
EXCEPT FOR ONE THING.

181
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,791
HEY, HAVE YOU FOUND
THAT THING YET?

182
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,458
- NUH-UH, I'M STILL
LOOKING AROUND THOUGH.

183
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,458
UH?
OH.

184
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,791
- ( through P.A. )
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO EARTH 

185
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,708
UNTIL YOU FIND IT,
UNDERSTAND?

186
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:25,875
- BUT THAT'S NOT FAIR.

187
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,958
UGH! OOH.

188
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,958
- ( through P.A. ) HOW'D YOU
LIKE IT IF I LEFT YOU

189
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,041
ORBITING THE EARTH IN NOTHING
BUT A SPACE SUIT, MIHOSHI?

190
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,625
HUH?
- WHAA!

191
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,333
I LOOKED EVERYWHERE.

192
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,500
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
IT COULD BE.

193
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,875
- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

194
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,833
HOW COULD YOU LOSE THE GEM
TENCHI GAVE YOU?

195
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,875
YOU'RE SO SCATTERBRAINED.

196
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,375
( gasps )

197
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,250
YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS WE REALLY
BELONG TO EARTH SOMEHOW.

198
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,166
THAT'S NICE.

199
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,833
I FEEL LIKE
WE'RE GOING BACK HOME.

200
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:03,666
- ( cracking )

201
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,333
- ( grunting )

202
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,375
- ( chuckles )

203
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,291
NOW THAT'S TAKEN CARE OF.

204
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:12,458
AND THAT IS THE END
OF SAKUYA.

205
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,500
- SAKUYA.

206
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,416
I HOPE SHE'S OKAY.

207
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,458
I BETTER FINISH THIS QUICK

208
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,958
SO I CAN GET BACK
AND CHECK ON HER.

209
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,375
- HEY, TENCHI.
- HUH?

210
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,541
OH, UH,
HI, YOU, GUYS.

211
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,916
- YOU'RE ALWAYS WORKING.

212
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,250
DON'T YOU EVER
TAKE A BREAK? 

213
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,375
IT'S SUMMER VACATION.
- HE CAN'T HELP IT.

214
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,833
HE'S GOT TO DO HIS TRAINING.

215
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,250
- WELL, WE'RE GOING
TO THE POOL.

216
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,708
WE'RE GONNA SWIM LAPS
AND COOL STUFF LIKE THAT.

217
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,041
( laughs ) DYING OF
JEALOUSY, AREN'T YOU?

218
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,916
- UH, YEAH RIGHT.

219
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,708
- NOW IF WE JUST HAD
SOME CUTE GIRLS

220
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,083
TO COME SWIMMING WITH US.
- MAYBE WE'LL MEET SOME. 

221
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,041
AT LEAST WE'RE NOT
SWEEPING FLOORS LIKE TENCHI.

222
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,541
WITH ALL THAT TRAINING,

223
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,125
HE DOESN'T HAVE TIME
FOR A GIRLFRIEND.

224
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,541
THAT'S WHY
HE DOESN'T HAVE ONE.

225
00:13:58,625 --> 00:13:59,791
- HUH?
- ( laughs )

226
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,708
- WELL, WE SHOULD
INTRODUCE HIM TO SOMEONE.

227
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,458
WE'LL SIMPLY SAY
THIS IS TENCHI.

228
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,458
HE'S NICE, BUT HE DOESN'T
KNOW ANY GIRLS.

229
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:06,875
- HUH? WHAT IS THIS?

230
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,083
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

231
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,250
YOU KNOW I HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND.

232
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,458
- NOW DON'T MAKE UP STORIES,
TENCHI.

233
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,125
YOU KNOW, WE'RE JUST KIDDING.

234
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,416
UNLESS YOU'VE BEEN
HOLDING OUT ON US.

235
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,375
- THAT'S IT!
HE'S BEEN HIDING SOME GIRL.

236
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,833
WHO IS SHE, TENCHI?
COME ON, TELL US.

237
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,500
- ARE YOU LOSING YOUR MIND?
IT'S SAKUYA.

238
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,500
YOU KNOW, SAKUYA KUMASHIRO.

239
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,291
- Both: SAKUYA KUMASHIRO?

240
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,583
- WHERE'D YOU MEET HER? 
WHAT DOES SHE LOOK LIKE?

241
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:30,833
- IS SHE CUTE?

242
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,583
- COME ON, BE SERIOUS.

243
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,083
YOU GUYS BOTH KNOW SAKUYA.

244
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,333
YOU KNOW, FROM OUR CLASS.

245
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,750
WE ALL WENT TO
THE BEACH TOGETHER.

246
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,916
- HMM.

247
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,916
- HMM.

248
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,333
- ALL RIGHT, IF THIS IS A JOKE,
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

249
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,583
JUST CUT IT OUT,
WILL YOU?

250
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,833
- WELL, OF COURSE I REMEMBER
THE BEACH AND EVERYTHING,

251
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,208
BUT AS FOR THE BABE,
'FRAID NOT.

252
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,833
- SAKUYA? YOU'RE PULLING
OUR LEG, AREN'T YOU?

253
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,166
WE'VE NEVER EVEN
HEARD OF HER.

254
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,041
- AH!

255
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,583
- Amagasaki:
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, BUDDY?

256
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:11,416
I THINK YOU MUST BE SUFFERING
FROM SUNSTROKE OR SOMETHING.

257
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,416
- Umanosuke: SAKUYA? WE'VE
NEVER EVEN HEARD OF HER.

258
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,166
- Tenchi: SAKUYA.

259
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,250
SAKUYA!

260
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,333
( running footsteps )

261
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,208
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
WHERE'RE YOU GOING?

262
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,625
TENCHI!

263
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,750
WHAT GIVES?

264
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,583
- HE'S GETTING WEIRD.

265
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,708
- I HAVE A BAD FEELING
ABOUT THIS,

266
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,208
LIKE SAKUYA'S IN TROUBLE.

267
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,250
- ( birds twitter )

268
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,750
- COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON.

269
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,625
OWW!  OWW, OWW, OWW,
OWW, OWW, OWW.

270
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,041
- ( computer beeping )

271
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,541
- DATA INPUT COMPLETE.

272
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,750
NOW FOR THE NEXT PHASE...
( cracks knuckles )

273
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,250
MY NEW ORGANIC
FLUCTUATION FILTER

274
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,375
SHOULD REVEAL THE TRUTH
UNDERLYING THIS IMAGE. 

275
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,166
JUST AS I THOUGHT.

276
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,666
SAKUYA KUMASHIRO
IS JUST A...

277
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,625
- ( footsteps )

278
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,000
SAKUYA!
( pants )

279
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,708
MAYBE SHE WENT
TO HER HOME.

280
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,833
BUT WHERE IS THAT?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW.

281
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,166
AH, HERE SHE IS.

282
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,375
YEAH, HER NAME'S RIGHT HERE
IN THE CLASS LIST.

283
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,875
THOSE GUYS WERE
JUST PUTTING ME ON.

284
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,291
EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

285
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,833
- ( Hotsuma chuckles )

286
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,250
THAT'LL TEACH HER.

287
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,666
THE END OF
THE FAMOUS SPACE PIRATE.

288
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,000
WE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN
RID OF HER LONG AGO, YUGI,

289
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,750
WITHOUT COOKING UP
SUCH AN ELABORATE PLAN.

290
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,541
( chuckles )

291
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,375
- Ryoko: ALL PART
OF THE PLAN, HUH?

292
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,791
YOU TALKED ME INTO
COMING OUT HERE.

293
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,500
IT WAS BECAUSE OF TENCHI.

294
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,708
I CAN SEE THAT NOW.

295
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,458
YOU WANTED TO GET ME
AWAY FROM HIM,

296
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,958
BUT WHY?

297
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,625
THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING
TO FIND OUT!

298
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,416
HIYA!

299
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:18,666
( grunts )

300
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,083
- ( groans )

301
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,333
- ( wind rushes )

302
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,833
- ( grunts )

303
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,125
HOW DID YOU DO IT?

304
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,958
HOW COULD YOU GET
AWAY FROM THERE

305
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,416
WHEN I BLEW UP EVERYTHING?

306
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,333
- HMPH.

307
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,583
THIS IS WHAT SAVED ME.

308
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,291
I REALIZED THAT I'D LEFT
THIS PICTURE BEHIND.

309
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,583
SO I WENT BACK
TO GET IT.

310
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:44,375
- A PHOTOGRAPH?  RUBBISH!

311
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,166
- RUBBISH TO YOU MAYBE.

312
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,500
THIS IS MORE VALUABLE TO ME

313
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,625
THAN ALL THE GOLD
AND JEWELS WE PIRATED.

314
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,833
IT'S MY FEELINGS FOR TENCHI
THAT SAVED ME.

315
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,625
- TOO BAD HE DOESN'T FEEL
THE SAME WAY ABOUT YOU.

316
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,958
HE'S ALREADY GOT SOMEONE ELSE.
YOU KNOW THAT.

317
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,958
HE PLAYED YOU FOR A FOOL,
RYOKO, WORSE THAN I DID.

318
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,416
AT LEAST YOU KNEW
I WAS A PIRATE.

319
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,333
- NONE OF THAT
MATTERS TO ME.

320
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:09,916
NOT ANYMORE.

321
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,833
REWARDS?  THAT'S NOT
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

322
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,125
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR ANYTHING.

323
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:18,875
ALL THAT MATTERS NOW 
IS HOW I FEEL INSIDE.

324
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,083
- HOW DO YOU FEEL INSIDE, RYOKO?

325
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,166
- IT'S CALLED LOVE, HOTSUMA.

326
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,291
YOU KNOW? SOMETHING GUYS
LIKE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

327
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,000
BUT IT'S SOMETHING
I CAN FEEL RIGHT HERE.

328
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,666
AND THAT'S ALL I NEED.

329
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,375
- ( gem rings )

330
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,333
- ( gasps )
- YOU'RE MINE.

331
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:38,125
- HUH?
- ( grunts )

332
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,291
- TENCHI!

333
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,708
HE'S IN DANGER.

334
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,833
- ( gem rings )

335
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,375
- AH! WHAT'S THIS?

336
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,791
- ( gem rings )
- ( gasps )

337
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,041
HEY, IS THAT WHAT
I THINK IT IS?

338
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,875
IT IS!

339
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,791
BUT WHY IS IT GLOWING
LIKE THAT?

340
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,625
UNLESS SOMETHING'S WRONG.

341
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:10,625
- OH NO.

342
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,083
ALL SYSTEMS
INCREASE POWER!

343
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,583
WE'VE GOT TO GET TO EARTH FAST.
- ( engine roars )

344
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,250
- AYEKA, LOOK!

345
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,375
IT STARTED GLOWING.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN? 

346
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,000
- ( gasps )

347
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:28,500
WHAT?  WHAT'S THAT LIGHT?

348
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:31,000
- ( birds chirp )

349
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,416
- HMM.

350
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,250
NOW COMES THE TEST.

351
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:39,416
- IT'S HERE ALREADY.
I THOUGHT WE'D HAVE MORE TIME.

352
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,916
WE'D BETTER MOVE
QUICKLY OR ELSE.

353
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,750
- ( grunts )

354
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,708
- ( groans )
- I'M OUT OF HERE.

355
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,416
- YOU'RE NOT GOING TO EARTH.
- TRY AND STOP ME.

356
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,125
- I'LL DO MORE THAN THAT!
- YOU'RE ALL TALK!

357
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,375
- AS SOON AS WE ENTER
EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE,

358
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,791
HEAD STRAIGHT
FOR OKAYAMA. 

359
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,375
- ( explosion )
- ( metal clangs )

360
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,375
- ( buzzer sounds )

361
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,750
- WHAT HAPPENED
BACK THERE?

362
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,625
- WE'RE UNDER ATTACK.
PART OF THE WING BLEW UP.

363
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,583
THE SHIP
IS OUT OF CONTROL.

364
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,791
- BUT WHO'S ATTACKING US?

365
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,625
- HMM.

366
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,625
- ( beeping )

367
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,708
- HERE'S THE FILE I WANT.

368
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,291
A DIGITAL CAPTURE OF YUGI
DURING OUR LAST BATTLE.

369
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,833
AND IF I USE MY ORGANIC
FLUCTUATION FILTER...

370
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,083
IT ALL BECOMES CLEAR.

371
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,458
SAKUYA IS A PHANTASMAGORIC
EXTENSION OF YUGI.

372
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:41,458
SHE IS A CREATION OF YUGI,
BUT SHE DOESN'T REALLY EXIST.

373
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:44,958
SHE'S LIKE A SHADOW
LIVING IN A SHADOW WORLD.

374
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,250
- ( running footsteps )

375
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,750
( panting )

376
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,125
SO THIS IS
WHERE SHE LIVES.

377
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,833
( pants )

378
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,958
SAKUYA, IT'S ME, TENCHI.
ARE YOU IN THERE?

379
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,708
SAKUYA?

380
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,500
I'M COMING IN
SO GET READY.

381
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,500
HUH?

382
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,875
SAKUYA.

383
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:24,916
- ( crowd chatters )

384
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,375
- NO.
( sobs )

385
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,791
I DON'T WANT
TO BE ALONE.

386
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:34,208
TENCHI, I'M SCARED.

387
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:39,041
( echoes )
TENCHI!

388
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,750
- ( theme song plays )

389
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:09,333
- ( singing in Japanese )

390
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,333
- ( meowing )

391
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:10,250
( meows )

392
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:17,125
- Tenchi: HELLO, SAKUYA?
IT'S ME.

393
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:18,458
NO, NOTHING
IN PARTICULAR.

394
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:21,041
IT'S JUST, WELL,
YOU'VE BEEN KIND OF DOWN LATELY.

395
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:22,333
AND I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE

396
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:24,458
IT'D CHEER YOU UP
IF WE WENT OUT SOMEWHERE,

397
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:26,416
YOU KNOW, TOGETHER
TO HAVE SOME FUN. 

398
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,250
I MEAN, IF THAT'S
OKAY WITH YOU?

399
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:31,291
I DON'T MEAN TO INVADE
YOUR PRIVACY OR ANYTHING,

400
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,250
BUT, WELL, I JUST REALLY
WANT TO DO SOMETHING

401
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:34,583
TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

402
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:37,583
THE NEXT EPISODE OF THE
NEW TENCHI MUYO SERIES...
