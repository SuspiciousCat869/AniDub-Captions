1
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,458
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:45,583
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,833
- ( sirens blaring )

4
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,458
- THIS IS THE GALAXY POLICE.

5
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:10,541
YOU ARE COMPLETELY SURROUNDED.

6
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,666
YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE
TO SURRENDER.

7
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
- ( all screaming )

8
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,416
- ( coughs )
HUH?

9
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,083
- YOU GUYS ARE
REALLY PATHETIC.

10
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,208
YOU DON'T THINK WE PLANNED
AN ESCAPE ROUTE?

11
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:31,333
TIME TO SPLIT, BOYS.

12
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:32,375
- ( men cheering )

13
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,583
- READY DOWN HERE.
HOTSUMA!

14
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,958
- ( all cheer )

15
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,916
- ( groans )

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,916
( grunts )

17
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,875
( groans )

18
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,750
- ( chuckles )

19
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:00,958
( laughs )

20
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,000
IF THEY MAKE IT ANY EASIER
TO WIN THESE LITTLE SKIRMISHES,

21
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,708
I MAY HAVE TO RETIRE FROM
SPACE PIRACY OUT OF BOREDOM.

22
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,166
- YOU WERE REALLY AMAZING.

23
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,250
- YOUR BOYS PERFORMED
VERY WELL, HOTSUMA.

24
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,666
I THINK THEY
DESERVE A REWARD.

25
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,333
LET'S GET BACK
TO THE HIDEOUT.

26
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,083
WE'LL HAVE A PARTY
TO CELEBRATE.

27
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,250
- ( cheering )

28
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,416
- Mihoshi: YEAH, OKAY!
TIME TO GET CRAZY.

29
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,000
LET'S PARTY HEARTY!
KNOCK OURSELVES OUT.

30
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,250
I-- ( grunts )
- Kiyone: MIHOSHI!

31
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,583
HAVE YOU GONE NUTS?
REMEMBER WHO WE ARE.

32
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,583
- I'M SORRY.  I FORGOT.

33
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,416
- RYOKO...

34
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,000
I NEVER IMAGINED
THERE'D COME A DAY

35
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,500
THAT I'D HAVE TO ARREST YOU.

36
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,375
- ( Ryoko laughs )

37
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,500
- ( locusts chirping )

38
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,583
- YOU HAVE 30 MINUTES
TO FINISH THE EXAM.

39
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,125
WORK QUICKLY.

40
00:03:57,208 --> 00:04:00,083
- AAH!  I DON'T KNOW
THE ANSWERS TO ANYTHING.

41
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,791
- ( sighs )

42
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,708
Tenchi: I NEVER THOUGHT
THEY HAD LOCUSTS IN TOKYO.

43
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,000
- ( chirping )

44
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,291
- ( bell tolling )
- ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY.

45
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,375
TIME'S UP.

46
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,166
COLLECT THE SHEETS
AND PASS THEM IN.

47
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,500
- ( students murmur )

48
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,500
- ( groans )
THAT'S OVER.

49
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:19,791
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

50
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,333
HOW DID YOU DO?
DID YOU PASS IT?

51
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,333
- SURE, IT WASN'T
TOO BAD NOW, WAS IT?

52
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:26,250
- DOES THE NAME "TITANIC"
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

53
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,666
- DID YOU ACE IT,
PROFESSOR?

54
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,333
- I THINK I DID SO-SO.

55
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,291
- I THINK AMAGASAKI
AND I ARE GONNA HAVE TO

56
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,958
TRY AGAIN WITH
A MAKE-UP EXAM.

57
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,625
- WHAT FOR?
- WHAT'S THE POINT?

58
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,291
I WON'T DO BETTER
ON A REPEAT.

59
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,291
- ( cries )

60
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,583
- THERE GOES
MY SUMMER VACATION.

61
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,500
- I'M GLAD THAT'S OVER.

62
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,208
- YEP.  DID YOU HAVE
ANY TROUBLE WITH IT?

63
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,291
- NOT REALLY.

64
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,333
- ( groans )
- OH, BROTHER.

65
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,000
- NO.
- NOT EVERYBODY HERE'S

66
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,625
A BRAINIAC.
- WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

67
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,500
ALL WE DID WAS PASS.
- I MEAN, COME ON.

68
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,875
WE'RE NOT REALLY
THAT BRILLIANT.

69
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,333
- Sakuya and Tenchi:
RIGHT?

70
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,541
- ( all groan )

71
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,166
- I'M BORED WITH ALL THIS.

72
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,625
NOW THAT EXAMS ARE OVER,

73
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:58,833
WHY DON'T WE ALL
TAKE A BREAK

74
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,833
AND GO SOMEPLACE
FUN FOR AWHILE?

75
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,875
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- IT'S SUMMER VACATION.

76
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,250
WE SHOULD GO ON
A TRIP SOMEWHERE.

77
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,041
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- DON'T KNOW.

78
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,875
- SOUNDS GOOD.
- WHERE SHOULD WE GO?

79
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,833
- DID I ASK YOU TO COME?

80
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,041
- YOU'RE SUCH A PIG.

81
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,458
IT'S SO SIMPLE.

82
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,708
WHEREVER TENCHI GOES,
SAKUYA WILL GO WITH HIM, RIGHT?

83
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:17,208
- RIGHT.
( giggles )

84
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,708
- ALL RIGHT.
EVERYBODY'S GOING.

85
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,166
TENCHI, YOU PICK THE PLACE.

86
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,458
- WHY ME, GUYS?

87
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,208
- BECAUSE THIS WILL BE
YOUR FIRST SUMMER BREAK

88
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,875
IN TOKYO.
WE SHOULD GO SOMEWHERE

89
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,000
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN.

90
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,708
- AND BESIDES,
ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL,

91
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,000
WE TRUST YOUR JUDGMENT.

92
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,208
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

93
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,208
- Girls:
IT'S OBVIOUS.

94
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,375
- WE DON'T TRUST YOU.

95
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,375
- Girls: COME ON, TENCHI.
CHOOSE.

96
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,250
- Tenchi: UH, WELL...
- Amagasaki: COME ON, BUDDY.

97
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,166
- Tsuchida: WE HAVEN'T GOT
ALL DAY, YOU KNOW?

98
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,333
- Sakuya: IT'S AMAZING.
PEOPLE ARE DRAWN TO TENCHI

99
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,666
LIKE A MAGNET.

100
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,625
I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED.
I FEEL THE SAME WAY.

101
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,583
- MAKING PLANS TO GET AWAY
FOR SOME FUN THIS SUMMER.  YEP.

102
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,416
MAKES ME WISH I WAS
17 AGAIN.

103
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,958
EXCEPT FOR THE ZITS
AND BEING GROUNDED ALL THE TIME.

104
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,666
- ( men chattering )

105
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,708
- AHH.

106
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:12,958
( chuckles )

107
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,500
THIS BOOZE TASTES
A WHOLE LOT BETTER

108
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,750
IN A STOLEN CUP.

109
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,416
LET YOUR HAIR DOWN
AND GET CRAZY, EVERYBODY.

110
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,250
AND DRINK ALL YOU WANT.
YOU EARNED IT.

111
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,541
- ( cheering )

112
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:22,708
- WHAT'S WITH YOU?

113
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,041
YOU GOT SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO SAY?

114
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,291
- I WAS THINKING WHAT
A GOOD TEAM WE MAKE

115
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,375
AND HOW WE SHOULD
KEEP IT GOING.

116
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,333
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

117
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,250
- OH.
I'LL DRINK TO THAT.

118
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,625
- Kiyone: WELL WELL,
OUR ANONYMOUS INFORMANT

119
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,125
WAS RIGHT AFTER ALL.

120
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,750
TERRIFIC.

121
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,291
A DETECTIVE'S DREAM.

122
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,625
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL FINALLY GET PROMOTED.

123
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:45,750
( chuckles )

124
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,375
I CAN MAKE LIEUTENANT!

125
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,625
- All: HUH?

126
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,125
- DRINK UP!
- ( cheering )

127
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,958
- I GOTTA BE MORE CAREFUL
WITH WHAT I SAY

128
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,083
AND DO AROUND HERE.

129
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,625
AND I'D BETTER
CHECK ON MIHOSHI.

130
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,791
SHE'S MORE LIKELY TO BLOW
OUR COVER THAN I AM.

131
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,333
NOW WHERE IS SHE?
( gasps )

132
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,291
- HERE'S MY GALAXY
POLICE DANCE.

133
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,625
( giggles )
THEY'LL BE COMING

134
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,416
TO GET YOU IN A SPACESHIP,
SWEETIE.

135
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,583
( giggles )
- IDIOT!

136
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,708
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
DON'T YOU KNOW WHY WE'RE HERE?!

137
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,166
- WELL, SURE I DO.

138
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,458
WE'RE HERE TO SERVE

139
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,375
THE BEST SPACE PIRATE
IN THE UNIVERSE, RYOKO.

140
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,791
- NO, WE'RE NOT!

141
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,916
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
WE'RE GALAXY POLICE DETECTIVES!

142
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,166
POLICE DETECTIVES!

143
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,166
UH...

144
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,000
UH, PARTY!

145
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,125
- ( cheering )

146
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,250
- IT'S TIME TO
BRING IN OUR GUYS.

147
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,833
WE HAVE TO CONTACT
HEADQUARTERS

148
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,666
AND GET A SPECIAL
SWAT TEAM SENT OUT.

149
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,666
- KIYONE, YOU'RE CUTTING OFF
ALL MY AIR.

150
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,250
- SOMEHOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
FIGURE OUT A WAY

151
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,583
TO GET EVERYBODY
IN THE CAVE

152
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,458
UNTIL OUR TROOPS
CAN SURROUND THE PLACE,

153
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,333
GET ME?
- KEEP EVERYBODY IN.

154
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,041
- VERY GOOD.
- ( groans )

155
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,916
( sighs )
HOW COME YOU'RE SO NERVOUS

156
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,250
ABOUT MAKING SURE
WE APPREHEND THESE GUYS?

157
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,250
- IF WE'RE ABLE TO PUT
A STOP TO RYOKO AND HER PIRATES,

158
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,958
AND WE MAKE IT
BACK HOME IN ONE PIECE,

159
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,541
WE'RE DEFINITELY
GONNA GET PROMOTED.

160
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,708
IN FACT, I EXPECT
TO BE MADE LIEUTENANT.

161
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,333
( giggles )

162
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,375
OH-- PARTY DOWN!
- ( cheering )

163
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,625
- IF YOU HARNESSED ALL THE
BRAIN WAVES IN THIS ROOM,

164
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,833
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO POWER
A 15-WATT BULB.

165
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,291
- Mihoshi: KIYONE, DON'T YOU
EVER WONDER WHY RYOKO

166
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,541
WENT BACK TO HER LIFE
AS A SPACE PIRATE?

167
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,083
- Kiyone: HUH?
- Mihoshi: I MEAN, WE WERE ALL

168
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,541
HAVING A GOOD TIME TOGETHER
ON EARTH, WEREN'T WE?

169
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,750
- I GUESS SO.

170
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,375
- DO YOU THINK IT'S
BECAUSE OF TENCHI?

171
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,416
- HUH?
- YEAH, REMEMBER

172
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,583
THE HIGH SCHOOL FESTIVAL?

173
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,416
THAT'S WHEN RYOKO
STARTED ACTING STRANGE.

174
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,625
I WONDER IF SOMETHING
HAPPENED

175
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:22,750
BETWEEN HER AND TENCHI.

176
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,375
- YOU THINK SHE RAN OFF
OUT OF DESPAIR?

177
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,208
WELL, I SUPPOSE
IT'S POSSIBLE.

178
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,416
IT WOULD CERTAINLY
EXPLAIN A LOT OF THINGS.

179
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,250
ON THE OTHER HAND,
IT COULD BE THAT SHE JUST MISSED

180
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,750
STEALING STUFF INSTEAD OF
WORKING FOR A LIVING.

181
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,791
- RIGHT.  BUT IF SOMETHING
HAPPENED WITH TENCHI

182
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,666
THAT MADE HER FEEL
DESPERATE AND CRAZY,

183
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,000
THEN I FEEL SORRY FOR HER.

184
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,208
- I UNDERSTAND.

185
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,416
- THANKS.
I'M REALLY WORRIED, YOU KNOW?

186
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,541
SHE'S SENSITIVE.
CAN WE HELP OUT?

187
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,875
I MEAN,
WE ARE HER FRIENDS.

188
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,000
- IF YOU'RE RIGHT,
SHE DESERVES THAT CHANCE.

189
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,208
I WON'T BRING IN
THE SWAT TEAM

190
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,458
UNTIL WE'VE OBSERVED HER.

191
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:53,125
- THANKS!  YOU'RE GREAT.
( giggles )

192
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,208
- CUT IT OUT, MIHOSHI.

193
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,541
- YOU TWO BEHIND THE PILLAR,

194
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:56,750
COME OUT HERE.

195
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:57,750
- Both: YOU CALLED?

196
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,458
- WAIT A MINUTE,

197
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:00,791
- OH, NO.
- YIKES, WHAT DO WE DO?

198
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,416
- SHE'S ONTO US.
- OH, THIS IS AWFUL.

199
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,416
- AREN'T YOU THE NEW SERVANTS?

200
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,750
- Both: YES.
- LOOKS TO ME LIKE

201
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:06,916
YOU'VE BEEN NEGLECTING
YOUR DUTIES

202
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,666
SO YOU CAN PARTY DOWN
WITH THE GUYS.

203
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,791
- THAT'S US.
WE'RE BIG PARTY ANIMALS.

204
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,291
- AND WE'RE VERY SORRY.

205
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,791
- NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
I'M ASSIGNING YOU

206
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:14,833
TO CLEAN THE HIDEOUT.

207
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,458
- WAIT A MINUTE,
THIS IS A BIG PLACE.

208
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,791
- WE'RE ON IT, MA'AM.

209
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,166
- Both: BYE.

210
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,291
- WHO ARE THEY?
NEVER SEEN THEM BEFORE.

211
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,458
- JUST TWO GIRLS
I PRESSED INTO SERVICE.

212
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,625
THEY'RE STUPID,
BUT THEY KEEP ME ENTERTAINED.

213
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:29,291
HMM.  TIME TO WORK,
MIHOSHI AND KIYONE.

214
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,625
- ( grunts )

215
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:31,833
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE HAVE TO CLEAN

216
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,291
THIS DINGY OLD DUNGEON.

217
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,958
- IT'S BETTER THAN
BEING LOCKED UP IN

218
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,541
THE DINGY OLD DUNGEON.

219
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,375
- Ryoko: YOU'RE NOT MOVING
FAST ENOUGH, YOU SLACKERS.

220
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:41,125
GUESS I'LL HAVE TO GIVE YOU
A LITTLE POKE IN THE RIBS.

221
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,666
- Both: WHOA!

222
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,708
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- WE'RE DUSTING!

223
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,125
- ( cheering )
- ( girls screaming )

224
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,500
- HEY, IT'S TIME FOR LUNCH.

225
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,291
HOW ABOUT SERVANT GIRLS
ON A SKEWER?

226
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,791
- OH, IT'S A DEAD END.

227
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,791
- Both: WHOA!

228
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,958
- SINCE YOU'RE NO GOOD
AT CLEANING,

229
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,666
YOU'LL HAVE TO COOK
TONIGHT'S DINNER.

230
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,500
( laughs )

231
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,000
HOPE YOU CAN BARBEQUE.

232
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,291
WE'RE CARNIVORES.

233
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,333
BY THE WAY,
SO'S THE MAIN DISH.

234
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,583
- ( cheering )
- ( girls screaming )

235
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,583
- ( roars )

236
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:13,833
- YOU'D BETTER HURRY

237
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:14,958
BEFORE OUR DINNER MAKES

238
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,083
A MEAL OUT OF YOU.

239
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,458
( laughs )

240
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,083
LAUNDRY TIME, FOLKS.

241
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,541
LET'S NOT KEEP
THESE GIRLS WAITING.

242
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,333
HAND OVER YOUR TOPS
AND BOTTOMS.

243
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,791
- ( cheering )

244
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,500
- ( both scream )

245
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,125
WHOA!

246
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,000
- ( laughs )

247
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,541
- THEY DIDN'T PUT IN
FABRIC SOFTENER.

248
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,541
- WE NEED SOME ENTERTAINMENT
AROUND HERE.

249
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:40,583
- ( laughing )

250
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,375
- Both:
WE JUST FLEW IN FROM VEGAS

251
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,250
AND BOY, OUR ARMS ARE TIRED.

252
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,541
- WHAT DO YOU GET
WHEN YOU CROSS

253
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,875
A HUMMINGBIRD WITH A BELL?

254
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,041
- A HUM-DINGER!

255
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,250
- UH?

256
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,541
- Both: AW, COME ON, GUYS.

257
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,583
THAT JOKE WASN'T SO BAD,
NOW WAS IT?

258
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,541
- ( men shouting )
- HEY, WATCH IT!

259
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,541
- OW!
- HEY!

260
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,041
- ( laughing )

261
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,000
- Both:
HOW DO YOU LIKE THIS TRICK?

262
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,458
- Mihoshi:
THAT'S NOT VERY NICE.

263
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:01,458
- Kiyone:
YOU THINK THIS IS EASY?

264
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:02,958
- ( laughs )

265
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,958
- Both:
HOW ABOUT TIGHTROPE WALKING?

266
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,416
- Mihoshi: HOW ABOUT
IF I JUMP THROUGH

267
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,416
A CIRCLE OF FLAME?

268
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,416
- TA-DA!
- ( screams )

269
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,833
- ( men shout )

270
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:11,833
- ( laughs )

271
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,208
- YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE.

272
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,250
I'LL HAVE TO DO
MY FIRE BREATHING ACT.

273
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,541
- YOU CAN REALLY DO THAT?

274
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:17,750
- YEAH, WITH ANY LUCK.

275
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,583
- ( screams )
- ( men cheer )

276
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,250
- HEY, THEY'RE NOT
THROWING STUFF.

277
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,208
OOH-OOH-OOH, OOH-OOH-OOH.

278
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,166
- I'M GONNA WET MY PANTS
FROM LAUGHING.

279
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,250
- GUESS WHAT--
THEY LIKE THIS ONE, HUH?

280
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,625
( giggles )
- YEAH?

281
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:32,916
- TERRIFIC.

282
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,083
THEY MAKE ME LAUGH
JUST AS MUCH NOW AS BEFORE.

283
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,583
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
KIYONE?

284
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:37,833
- I'LL SURVIVE.

285
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,291
AND ANYWAY,
IT'S A SMALL PRICE TO PAY

286
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,291
FOR MY PROMOTION.

287
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,666
I GOTTA TELL YOU THOUGH,

288
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,958
RYOKO SEEMS TO BE HAVING
WAY TOO MUCH FUN WITH THIS.

289
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,708
HER SADISTIC SIDE
REALLY COMES OUT

290
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,500
WHEN SHE HAS POWER
OVER SOMEBODY.

291
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,916
- I'M NOT SO SURE
ABOUT THAT.

292
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,708
SHE WAS TRULY
ENJOYING HERSELF.

293
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,916
IT LOOKED LIKE SHE WAS LAUGHING
JUST THE WAY SHE USED TO

294
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,083
BACK ON EARTH.

295
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,166
- ALL THAT DOES
IS TELL ME

296
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,041
SHE WAS SADISTIC
WHEN WE ROOMED TOGETHER.

297
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,333
- ( laughing )

298
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,541
- ( chuckles )

299
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,708
- ( meows )

300
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:12,916
- ( meows )

301
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,750
- HERE'S SOME TEA, RYOKO.

302
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:18,708
- THANKS.

303
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,125
SO, LONG TIME NO SEE.

304
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,750
- REALLY?
- HERE, KIYONE.

305
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,625
OOH!
- YAH YAH YAH YAH!

306
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,083
ARE YOU TRYING
TO KILL ME, GIRL?

307
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,000
MY BUTT'S ALREADY BURNED!
- SORRY.

308
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,416
- ( laughing ) YOU KNOW,
YOU REALLY GET ME GOING,

309
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,333
BOTH OF YOU.
- SO WHEN DID YOU FIGURE

310
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:33,958
OUT IT WAS US?

311
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,208
- UM...

312
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,333
NOW LET ME SEE.

313
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,500
THIS IS GONNA BE
OUR FIRST RAID TOGETHER.

314
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,000
JUST DO WHAT I TELL YOU,
AND YOU'LL ALL BE RICH.

315
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,916
- ( cheering )
- Both: YAY!

316
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,458
- IT WAS AROUND THEN.

317
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,708
- FROM THE VERY START?!

318
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,375
- SO MUCH FOR
UNDERCOVER WORK, HUH?

319
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,250
- ( yelps )

320
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,916
- ( laughs )

321
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,208
MAYBE YOU'D BETTER STAY HERE
TILL YOUR BUTT HEALS.

322
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,833
- IS IT ALL RIGHT,
REALLY?

323
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,250
IT'S SO COMFORTABLE HERE.

324
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,666
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
WE'RE BACK ON EARTH.

325
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,791
- YEAH.  IT KIND OF
FEELS THAT WAY, DOESN'T IT?

326
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,333
HOTSUMA MADE THIS ROOM
TO MY SPECIFICATIONS.

327
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,375
DIDN'T YOU, HOTSUMA?

328
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,666
HOTSUMA?

329
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,833
NOW WHERE DID HE GO?

330
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,250
HOTSUMA, COME IN HERE.

331
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,458
OH, WELL, HE MUST BE TIED UP.

332
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,583
ANYWAY,
IT'S PRETTY COMFORTABLE,

333
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,000
SO MAKE YOURSELVES AT HOME.

334
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,666
- Mihoshi:
THANKS, RYOKO.  WE WILL.

335
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,250
- TELL ME SOMETHING FIRST.
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

336
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,583
- WHY?  COME ON,

337
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,166
I WAS JUST TEASING YOU
A LITTLE BIT.

338
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,208
I'VE MISSED YOU GUYS.

339
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,375
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

340
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,500
- HEY, MIHOSHI,
WHAT A SURPRISE.

341
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,041
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD
BREATHE FIRE.

342
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,625
- ( giggles )
IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF

343
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,291
THIS MAGIC KIT
I GOT FROM WASHU.

344
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:34,041
- YOU NEVER TOLD ME SHE GAVE
YOU THAT. WAIT A MINUTE!

345
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,500
HOW COME YOU WENT BACK INTO
THE SPACE PIRATE BUSINESS?

346
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,500
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW.
- HUH?

347
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:41,166
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "WHY DID I GO
BACK TO BEING A SPACE PIRATE?"

348
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,416
THAT'S WHAT I DO
FOR A LIVING,

349
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH.

350
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,208
- OKAY, FINE.
THEN LET ME ASK THIS,

351
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,416
WHAT MADE YOU LEAVE EARTH?

352
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,375
- THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS,
DETECTIVE.

353
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,208
- SOMETHING HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU AND TENCHI

354
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,375
THAT DAY, DIDN'T IT?

355
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,583
- WHAT DAY?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

356
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,208
- WE WERE RIGHT.  SOMETHING DID
HAPPEN THEN, DIDN'T IT?

357
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,166
- I'M TELLING YOU,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

358
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,708
- WELL, I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE FESTIVAL THAT TOOK PLACE

359
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,166
AT THE HIGH SCHOOL.

360
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,875
- YEAH, WHAT ABOUT IT?

361
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,875
- RYOKO, YOU MIGHT BE
A GOOD PIRATE,

362
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,458
BUT YOU'RE A TERRIBLE LIAR.

363
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,541
- ( scoffs )
AH, BACK OFF OR ELSE!

364
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,416
- WHAT HAPPENED
WITH TENCHI THAT DAY?

365
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,916
- EXCUSE ME, RYOKO.

366
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,250
- HUH?
HEY, WHAT DO YOU WANT, MIHOSHI?

367
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,208
- WHERE'S THE RESTROOM
IN THIS HIDEOUT?!

368
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,250
- HUH?
- I'M DESPERATE, I TELL YOU.

369
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,125
I'VE BEEN LOOKING AROUND
FOR THE LAST 10 MINUTES.

370
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,875
OH!
- IT'S OFF THE ASSEMBLY HALL.

371
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,416
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
- ( both groan )

372
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,416
- WOMAN IN TROUBLE.
GANGWAY, COMING THROUGH!

373
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,208
( gasps )
- ( men chattering )

374
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,000
- OH, NO.
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

375
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,083
LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF THAT LINE.

376
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,333
THERE MUST BE A WAY
TO SPEED THOSE PIRATES UP.

377
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,333
OF COURSE!
I'LL GIVE THEM A HOT FOOT!

378
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,000
FIRE!

379
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,791
OOH!

380
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,708
- ( screaming )

381
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,291
- THANKS, I'LL BE RIGHT OUT.

382
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,125
- CAN I CHANGE THE SUBJECT?

383
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,250
- HMM?

384
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,916
- WHY ARE YOU WITH
THIS GUY HOTSUMA?

385
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,458
- AGAIN,
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

386
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:58,166
- Mihoshi: I'M BACK, LADIES.
BOY, WAS THAT A CLOSE CALL.

387
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,791
- YOU GOTTA ADMIT, HE'S NO MATCH
FOR TENCHI NOW, IS HE?

388
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,458
- YES, BUT TENCHI'S NOT
THE ONLY MAN IN THE WORLD.

389
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,958
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU MEAN THAT.
- OH, BUT I DO.

390
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,125
- WELL THEN, IF YOU'RE
OUT OF THE PICTURE,

391
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,375
CAN I HAVE TENCHI?

392
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,166
- OH MY, KIYONE.
DO YOU REALLY MEAN IT?

393
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,791
YOU WANT TO MARRY TENCHI?
OOH!

394
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,041
- HMM.  THIS DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE YOU AT ALL.

395
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,041
- WELL, I THINK TENCHI
DESERVES A SOBER,

396
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,916
LAW-ABIDING GIRL
LIKE MYSELF.

397
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,375
A GIRL WHO'D BE
GOOD FOR HIM.

398
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,500
- I HAVE A FEELING MIHOSHI
FRIED MORE THAN YOUR BUTT

399
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:23,583
WHEN SHE BURNED YOU.

400
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:24,791
ANYWAY, IT'S TOO LATE.

401
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:25,958
WHEN I SAW THEM
THAT EVENING,

402
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,541
TENCHI AND SAKUYA WERE--

403
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,125
( sighs )

404
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,416
- I WAS TRYING TO
GET HER TO OPEN UP,

405
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,833
BUT THAT WORKED A WHOLE LOT
BETTER THAN I IMAGINED.

406
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,833
- HMM.
- SO TENCHI AND SAKUYA

407
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,375
HAD SOMETHING GOING
ON BETWEEN

408
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,375
THEM DURING THE FESTIVAL?

409
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,708
- Mihoshi:
WHAT WAS IT, EXACTLY?

410
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,166
- Kiyone: I DON'T KNOW,
BUT THAT'S WHY RYOKO LEFT.

411
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,666
- SHUT UP!
STOP ALL YOUR STUPID BABBLING.

412
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,333
I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN THEM.

413
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,083
I JUST WANT TO
FORGET ABOUT IT, ALL RIGHT?

414
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,666
- YOU WANT TO
FORGET ABOUT EARTH?

415
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,833
COME ON, RYOKO.

416
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,833
THIS SPACE YOU HAD BUILT
IS A CARBON COPY

417
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,000
OF THE LIVING ROOM
AT THE MASAKI HOUSE.

418
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,166
YOU'VE BEEN TRYING VERY HARD
TO KEEP THOSE MEMORIES ALIVE.

419
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,625
WHY DON'T YOU STOP FIGHTING
AND ADMIT IT?

420
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,583
( grunts )
DON'T RUN AWAY.

421
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:10,583
- PLEASE, RYOKO.

422
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,041
- STOP FIGHTING
AND ADMIT WHAT?

423
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:16,041
I DO JUST FINE.
I DON'T NEED ANYBODY.

424
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,708
- THAT MAY BE TRUE, BUT ARE YOU
HAPPY WITH YOUR EMPTY LIFE,

425
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,458
KICKING AROUND AIMLESSLY?

426
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,000
- IT'S TOO LATE
TO GO BACK TO A NORMAL LIFE.

427
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,458
THINGS HAVE
CHANGED TOO MUCH.

428
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,875
- OH, BUT YOU HAVEN'T
CHANGED AT ALL, RYOKO.

429
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,875
- YOU THINK SO?
- POSITIVE?

430
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,208
LET'S DO SOMETHING FUN.
HOW ABOUT A GAME OF CARDS?

431
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,750
- WHAT?  YOU BROUGHT CARDS
ON THIS MISSION?

432
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,333
- ALL RIGHT.
IT'LL BE LIKE AT MASAKIS!

433
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,916
- SORRY, RYOKO,

434
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,375
BUT I CAN'T HAVE YOU CONSORTING
WITH THE GALAXY POLICE.

435
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,166
I'M AFRAID I'LL HAVE TO
BREAK THIS UP.

436
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,208
- CAPTAIN, WE JUST RECEIVED
AN ANONYMOUS CALL.

437
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,916
ACCORDING TO HIS INFORMATION,

438
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,250
RYOKO AND HER
BAND OF PIRATES

439
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,250
ARE HIDING OUT AT
POINT TWO-ZERO-ZERO.

440
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,500
- POINT TWO-ZERO-ZERO
IS THE SPOT WHERE OFFICERS

441
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,583
MIHOSHI AND KIYONE
WENT UNDERCOVER.

442
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,250
ALL RIGHT, MEN.
LET'S GET MOVING.

443
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,541
WE'LL PROCEED THERE
IMMEDIATELY.

444
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,916
- CAN'T USE THAT ONE.
WHAT WAS YOUR MISSION

445
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,625
ACTUALLY SUPPOSED
TO ACCOMPLISH HERE?

446
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,625
- WE WERE SUPPOSED TO
INFILTRATE YOUR GANG

447
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,750
AND FIND THE LOCATION
OF YOUR SECRET HIDEOUT.

448
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,708
AND REPORT TO
THE TASK FORCE CAPTAIN,

449
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,166
THEN WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO KEEP YOU HERE

450
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,750
UNTIL HIS UNITS ARRIVED.

451
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,375
BUT I GUESS OUR ASSIGNMENT
WILL BE INCOMPLETE.

452
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,916
WE HAVEN'T REPORTED.

453
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,083
- ( laughs )

454
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,083
IT WOULDN'T MATTER
IF YOU DID CALL THEM IN.

455
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,375
YOU COULDN'T KEEP ME
HERE LONG ENOUGH

456
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,041
FOR THOSE BOZOS
TO CATCH ME.

457
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,375
- HMM.  ALL RIGHT.

458
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,750
YOU GOT A FREE RIDE
ON THIS ONE.

459
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,583
DON'T PUSH IT.
AHH.

460
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,125
- YEAH, CIRCUS TRICKS.

461
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,291
- I LOVE BEING WITH FRIENDS.
THIS IS NICE.

462
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,625
EVEN THOUGH WE WERE
SEPARATED FOR A LONG TIME,

463
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,791
WE PICKED OURSELVES UP
RIGHT WHERE WE LEFT OFF.

464
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,333
- HMM.  HMM?

465
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,083
( groans )
- ( giggles )

466
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,416
- ( alarm blaring )

467
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,000
- HEY, WHAT'S THAT?

468
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,291
- RYOKO!
- WHAT'S GOING ON, HOTSUMA?

469
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,125
- IT'S THE GALAXY POLICE.
THEY'RE HERE.

470
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,458
- HUH?
OH, MY FRIENDS ARE COOL.

471
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,625
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THEM.

472
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:59,541
- OH, REALLY?
WELL LOOK AT THIS.

473
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,000
- THAT'S THE TASK FORCE'S
NEW FLEET OF SPACE CRUISERS.

474
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,791
- THIS IS THE GALAXY POLICE.

475
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,666
RYOKO, YOU HAVE
NO PLACE TO RUN.

476
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,291
SURRENDER AT ONCE
OR WE'LL ATTACK.

477
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,625
THERE'LL BE
NO FURTHER WARNING.

478
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,208
- ( watch beeping )

479
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,125
- HMM?

480
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,125
- DETECTIVES KIYONE
AND MIHOSHI,

481
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,666
THIS IS TASK FORCE COMMAND.

482
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,916
EXCELLENT JOB.
YOUR ASSIGNMENT IS COMPLETE.

483
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,833
REPORT BACK TO HEADQUARTERS,
OVER.

484
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,666
- KIYONE,
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

485
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,791
- UM...

486
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,791
- ( scoffs )
VERY CLEVER, LADIES.

487
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,125
- IT WASN'T US!
- STOP IT!

488
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,041
YOU CALL YOURSELVES FRIENDS.

489
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:33,500
THIS IS WHY I WENT BACK
TO BEING A SPACE PIRATE.

490
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,333
SO I COULD DISRUPT THE WORLD

491
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,291
THAT NASTY BACKSTABBERS
LIKE THE BOTH OF YOU

492
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:38,500
WALK AROUND IN.

493
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,833
- NO, WAIT!  WE REALLY
DIDN'T BRING THEM HERE.

494
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,500
- WE'D BETTER SPLIT.

495
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,916
- HMM.
- Mihoshi: RYOKO!

496
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,375
- WAIT!  DON'T LEAVE!
WHAT ABOUT TENCHI?

497
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,333
IS THIS WHAT
YOU REALLY WANT?

498
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,041
YOU'RE NEVER GOING
BACK TO EARTH?

499
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,500
- THAT'S HISTORY.

500
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:53,708
- WE'VE GOT TO MOVE.

501
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,583
- RYOKO...

502
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,583
CAN'T WE TRY TO STOP HER,
KIYONE?

503
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:58,875
- I CAN'T 'CAUSE I'M INJURED,

504
00:18:58,958 --> 00:18:59,875
SO I'LL HAVE TO
COUNT ON YOU.

505
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:00,875
- RIGHT.

506
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,166
- Hotsuma: LISTEN UP,
THERE'S NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF.

507
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,208
THE GALAXY POLICE ARE
A BUNCH OF PAPER TITLES.

508
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,291
PROTECT THIS HIDEOUT
NO MATTER WHAT.

509
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,875
- ( cheering )
- RYOKO, WAIT!

510
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,375
PLEASE!
DON'T RUN AWAY FROM US.

511
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,958
I'M SURE WE CAN
WORK THIS OUT.

512
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,541
LET'S GO BACK TO EARTH
TOGETHER.

513
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,833
- SORRY, MIHOSHI.
- PLEASE, RYOKO.

514
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,541
WE'RE YOUR FRIENDS.
DON'T DO THIS.

515
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,541
- YOU MEN KEEP HER
FROM GETTING ONBOARD.

516
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,458
- ( sighs )

517
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,333
- ( men shouting )

518
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:36,041
- WHOA!
BACK OFF, YOU GUYS.

519
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:39,291
DON'T COME NEAR
OR YOU'LL BE BARBEQUED!

520
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:42,958
HERE COMES THE FIRE.

521
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,000
- ( screaming )

522
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,291
- YAH!

523
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,625
- ( men scream )

524
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,916
- HOW DO YOU LIKE
YOUR STEAKS?

525
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,333
I CAN GIVE YOU WELL-DONE
OR MEDIUM-RARE!

526
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,625
- ( screaming )

527
00:19:58,416 --> 00:19:59,458
- RYOKO...

528
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,583
- THANKS, GIRLS,

529
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,583
FOR REMINDING ME
OF ANOTHER LIFE.

530
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,041
- YOU SEE, YOU APPLY
THIS FORMULA TO THIS ONE,

531
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,041
AND THERE YOU HAVE
YOUR SOLUTION.

532
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,250
- YOU MAKE IT
SOUND SO EASY.

533
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,708
NOW I KNOW WHERE
I WENT WRONG.

534
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:26,958
YOU'RE BRILLIANT, TENCHI.

535
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,958
- IF YOU VALEDICTORIANS
CAN STOP WRITING

536
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,791
YOUR SPEECHES FOR A SECOND,
SOMEONE NEEDS HELP.

537
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,916
- SO FAR, I'M FAILING
EVERY SUBJECT.

538
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,958
AND I'VE GOT THREE
MAKE-UP TESTS TO TAKE.

539
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,958
- I GUESS HE'S GOING
TO SUMMER SCHOOL.

540
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,708
HE'S GONNA MISS
THE WHOLE BREAK.

541
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,500
- I CAN'T GET STUCK
IN SUMMER SCHOOL!

542
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,791
I WANNA GO ON A TRIP
WITH EVERYONE ELSE!

543
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,916
- I'LL HELP TUTOR YOU.

544
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,625
- TENCHI'S AMAZING,
ISN'T HE?

545
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,166
- YEAH, HE'S A GOOD TEACHER.

546
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,125
HE'S GOT SIMPLE
EXPLANATIONS FOR EVERYTHING.

547
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,125
- HE CAN EVEN TEACH AMAGASAKI,
WHO NEVER UNDERSTANDS ANYTHING.

548
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,291
- AND AT THE SCHOOL FESTIVAL,
HE HELPED US PUT UP THE BOOTH

549
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,375
AND SOLD RAFFLE TICKETS.

550
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:58,916
- SAKUYA'S SO LUCKY.

551
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,333
- I BET YOU'D GO OUT WITH TENCHI
IN A MINUTE IF HE ASKED YOU.

552
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,500
- OF COURSE NOT.
HE'S DATING SAKUYA,

553
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,500
SO IT WOULD NEVER
COME UP, WOULD IT?

554
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,833
- Sakuya: TENCHI,
YOU'RE A PRETTY AMAZING GUY.

555
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,750
I WANT TO LEARN
A LOT MORE ABOUT YOU.

556
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,000
I JUST HOPE YOU FEEL
THE SAME WAY ABOUT ME.

557
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,333
- HUH?

558
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,083
TSUGARU, MATORI,

559
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:18,500
WELL, I REALLY DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE'S THINKING.

560
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,000
- HMM?

561
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,583
- WHATEVER'S ON YOUR MIND,
YOU CAN JUST FORGET IT.

562
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,458
( laughs )

563
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,166
- ( theme music playing )

564
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,833
- ( singing in Japanese )

565
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:06,375
- ( meows )

566
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,291
( meows )

567
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:14,208
- Mihoshi:
HI, IT'S ME, MIHOSHI.

568
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:15,958
LISTEN, WE'VE BEEN
DOING SO WELL

569
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:18,250
THAT G.P. HEADQUARTERS
FINALLY REWARDED US

570
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,416
WITH A MEDAL.

571
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,958
I BET TENCHI WILL BE
VERY EXCITED FOR US.

572
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:23,958
IF ONLY WE HAD A CHANCE
TO TELL HIM.

573
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,625
IT MUST BE SUMMER NOW
BACK ON EARTH.

574
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:29,458
KIYONE, DON'T WE HAVE
A SUMMER VACATION?

575
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,875
IF WE DO, I THINK I'LL LIKE
TO TAKE A TRIP TO EARTH

576
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:33,875
TO SEE TENCHI.

577
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:36,916
THE NEXT EPISODE OF
THE NEW TENCHI MUYO SERIES...
