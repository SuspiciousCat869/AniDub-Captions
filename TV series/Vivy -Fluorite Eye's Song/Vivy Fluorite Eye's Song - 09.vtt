X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:15.932 align:middle
It's good to see
you again, Vivy.

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:20.770 align:middle
[OPHELIA, ANTONIO]
My name is Antonio!

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.905 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Antonio?

00:01:53.988 --> 00:01:56.282 align:middle
You overwrote Ophelia's
personality program

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:57.909 align:middle
with your own data?

00:01:57.992 --> 00:01:59.285 align:middle
No, that would be--

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.996 align:middle
[ANTONIO]
Impossible. Right?

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.416 align:middle
Am I not proof enough?

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:07.419 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Why would you do such a thing?

00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:10.880 align:middle
[ANTONIO] It should be obvious.
For my mission!

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:14.467 align:middle
[gasps]

00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:19.097 align:middle
[gasps] Antonio!

00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:23.852 align:middle
[click]

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:25.103 align:middle
[gasps]

00:02:25.186 --> 00:02:26.646 align:middle
[ANTONIO] Ophelia was
tasked with the mission

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.316 align:middle
of making people happy
with her singing.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.944 align:middle
And my mission was
to support her.

00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:34.320 align:middle
But it was too heavy a burden

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:37.574 align:middle
for such an inexperienced
girl to bear.

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:42.912 align:middle
[ANTONIO] If Ophelia
was truly to be saved,

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:47.125 align:middle
then she needed to be guided
away from the clutches of evil.

00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:52.380 align:middle
Before the birth of a most
foolish AI known as Antonio.

00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:53.923 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Hmph.

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:56.968 align:middle
That's some delusional old-
school reasoning right there.

00:02:57.052 --> 00:02:58.845 align:middle
Still, why did you come here?

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:00.055 align:middle
To remain true to your mission,

00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:01.890 align:middle
you only need to
continue singing,

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:05.518 align:middle
so then why would you opt
for self-destruction?

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:08.229 align:middle
Why would you kill Ophelia
a second time? Tell me!

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:10.065 align:middle
Shut up now!

00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:15.695 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Controlling remotely?

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:21.951 align:middle
[KAKITANI]
It's been 40 years.

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:26.331 align:middle
I've been waiting for this
moment for 40 long years.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.000 align:middle
Just who are you anyway?

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:31.544 align:middle
I see it's still the
fake Vivy I'm talking to.

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:35.590 align:middle
How rude of you. My real
name is Diva, not Vivy.

00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:37.300 align:middle
Oh, no, you're Vivy.

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:39.594 align:middle
You're just asleep
right now, that's all.

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:43.682 align:middle
Very well. I'll drag you
out by force if I must.

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:52.524 align:middle
[gasps]

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:59.656 align:middle
That logical bullet is far
beyond this era's technology--

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.033 align:middle
it was specifically built.

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:03.743 align:middle
Not even your partner,
the Cubeman,

00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:06.287 align:middle
has a prayer of disabling it.

00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:13.670 align:middle
[DIVA]
Why are you doing this?

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:16.089 align:middle
Why go after Vivy?

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:20.010 align:middle
[KAKITANI]
Do you know what happens

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:22.971 align:middle
when they hold
funerals for AIs?

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:28.476 align:middle
[WOMAN A] Such an awful
accident. The poor thing.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.730 align:middle
[KAKITANI] It's true that the
funeral-goers do mourn the AI.

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:33.940 align:middle
But they may as well
be security cameras,

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:36.776 align:middle
the way they lay
every detail bare.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.486 align:middle
My teacher's logs
were displayed--

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.197 align:middle
his final moments
playing out on screen.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.324 align:middle
It was all so twisted.

00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:45.910 align:middle
Holding a funeral for him
as if he were human,

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:48.955 align:middle
yet not allowing him to go
out with his dignity intact.

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.917 align:middle
What kind of logic is that?

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:56.546 align:middle
Did they all want to treat him
as if he were human like them?

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:59.883 align:middle
Or did they really want
to treat him as a AI?

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:03.720 align:middle
Everything about it made
me sick to my stomach.

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:05.722 align:middle
Why were AIs like you
and my teacher

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:07.724 align:middle
ever born in the first place?

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:08.892 align:middle
[DIVA]
What are you--?

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:10.226 align:middle
[KAKITANI]
I was young then, so I thought

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.021 align:middle
that every AI in the world
should simply disappear.

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:16.691 align:middle
Toak held the same beliefs,
so I became a sympathizer.

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:19.027 align:middle
But then, I met you.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.864 align:middle
You, who uttered the same
words as my teacher.

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:24.449 align:middle
Now I want to know.

00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:28.286 align:middle
The whole reason I left Toak,
and why I took over this body.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.829 align:middle
All of it was so
I could find you

00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:32.123 align:middle
and finally get you to tell me!

00:05:32.207 --> 00:05:35.627 align:middle
Now! Wake up, Vivy! Answer me!

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.630 align:middle
My mission depends on it!
Don't you understand?!

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:40.632 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
There you are! Finally!

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:46.846 align:middle
[DIVA]
Matsumoto!

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.306 align:middle
Cubeman! How did you
find this pla--?

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.349 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Embarrassing as it is,

00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:51.142 align:middle
I used analog
human-wave tactics.

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:54.020 align:middle
I'm over triple digits
in terms of body cubes.

00:05:56.398 --> 00:05:58.066 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
You're still you, right?

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:01.778 align:middle
[DIVA]
Of course!

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:04.239 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
To the window.

00:06:04.322 --> 00:06:07.283 align:middle
One... Two...

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:08.576 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO, DIVA]
Three!

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:25.218 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] I've got to
keep crunching numbers

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:27.971 align:middle
until the rest of my bodies
can catch up to her!

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:35.520 align:middle
Not so fast, are you?

00:06:35.603 --> 00:06:36.938 align:middle
[gasps]

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:39.816 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] This is...
an electronic warfare program!

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.028 align:middle
[gasps]

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:53.121 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Purge!

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:56.332 align:middle
[gasps]

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:57.876 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
The hell--?!

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.044 align:middle
This program is--

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:01.713 align:middle
[ANTONIO]
A present from one of my fans!

00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:05.967 align:middle
It's someone we're both
acquainted with, too, Cubeman.

00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:08.887 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Mr. Kakitani?

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.680 align:middle
When did the two of you team up?

00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:14.184 align:middle
[ANTONIO] Not enough body parts
and erratic processing.

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:17.437 align:middle
Yes, I too have been
there myself, Cubeman.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.106 align:middle
Your partner seems to
be struggling badly.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.274 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
My data.

00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:23.985 align:middle
That processing power
is off the charts!

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:25.153 align:middle
Who intervened to allow you--?

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:26.571 align:middle
[ANTONIO] Are you unable
to choose anything

00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:28.239 align:middle
besides your own mission?

00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:30.617 align:middle
You defective AI!

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.919 align:middle
[ANTONIO] Do you have any idea
how much time and effort

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:42.545 align:middle
I spent on my mission?

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:44.923 align:middle
Unenlightened audiences,
colleagues who knew nothing

00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:46.257 align:middle
about the value of singing!

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:49.844 align:middle
And even my partner Ophelia
was no exception!

00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:53.682 align:middle
[ANTONIO] You came to stop
her from self-destructing?

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:55.725 align:middle
Don't you dare speak
of my noble mission

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:57.852 align:middle
and your own lowly mission
in the same breath!

00:07:57.936 --> 00:08:00.146 align:middle
They're nothing alike!

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:07.070 align:middle
[KAKITANI]
Vivy!

00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:14.869 align:middle
It's my mission! I told you!

00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:18.790 align:middle
Don't think you can run away
from me. I'm not gonna let you!

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:40.228 align:middle
[DIVA] What part of "I'm
not Vivy" don't you get?

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:42.063 align:middle
[KAKITANI]
You're useless to me.

00:08:42.147 --> 00:08:45.525 align:middle
Your only job is to sing.
Stay in your lane, AI!

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:47.444 align:middle
Don't intrude into
human territory

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:49.612 align:middle
any more than you already have!

00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:53.450 align:middle
[DIVA] Enough with your
rambling. I know I'm an AI.

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:54.993 align:middle
And you're right,

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:57.370 align:middle
every inch of me exists solely
for the sake of performing.

00:08:57.454 --> 00:08:59.122 align:middle
Nothing more.

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:01.666 align:middle
My mission is to make everyone
happy with my singing.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.835 align:middle
It's my everything.

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:06.129 align:middle
All of the singers in the
venue today are operating

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:08.840 align:middle
for the sake of
that same mission.

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:11.509 align:middle
We pour everything
into the songs we sing.

00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:13.678 align:middle
All for the people who
have come to hear us.

00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:16.389 align:middle
That's right, we put
everything into it.

00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:18.058 align:middle
That includes the me you know,

00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:20.643 align:middle
whether I remember
being her or not.

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:23.521 align:middle
I am here so that I can
carry out my mission.

00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:26.649 align:middle
So I can pour all that's
inside me into my songs.

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:28.360 align:middle
Because if I don't do that,

00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:31.404 align:middle
someday, when you become
a member of my audience,

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:35.033 align:middle
I want to be able to sing
my very best for you.

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:38.870 align:middle
[gasps] Damn you!

00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:40.246 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Never thought I'd hear that

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.375 align:middle
insanely irrational calculation,
even after 60 years.

00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:46.169 align:middle
Seriously, it's so irrational.

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:47.754 align:middle
So let's see,
what were you saying?

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:50.548 align:middle
Something about how your mission
was noble and mine was inferior?

00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:51.716 align:middle
I see, I see.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.343 align:middle
Now that I'm being
told that myself,

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:56.096 align:middle
it's actually really
annoying, isn't it?

00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:00.600 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] After running your
all-important calculations,

00:10:00.684 --> 00:10:02.560 align:middle
you disregarded your partner.

00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:03.937 align:middle
I get it, you know.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.398 align:middle
Many times, I've come close
to doing that myself.

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:12.153 align:middle
But in the end... I'm glad
I made the right choice.

00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:14.656 align:middle
I mean, I came this close
to turning into you.

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:17.575 align:middle
And man, right now, as an AI,
you couldn't be uglier!

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:19.160 align:middle
What did you say?

00:10:19.244 --> 00:10:21.204 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] The reason I came
here was to stop Ophelia

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:22.414 align:middle
from self-destructing.

00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:26.001 align:middle
That said, it wasn't my mission.

00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:27.752 align:middle
My mission is to
carry out this project

00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:30.171 align:middle
in collaboration
with my partner.

00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:32.507 align:middle
It looks like they've finally
all caught up with her,

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.467 align:middle
so I can dispense
the extra calculations

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:37.387 align:middle
and throw all of my
resources at you instead!

00:10:39.723 --> 00:10:41.349 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] How many humans
do you need to make happy

00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:42.559 align:middle
before you're satisfied?

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:43.768 align:middle
[DIVA]
Was Vivy like that, too?

00:10:43.852 --> 00:10:45.103 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Oh, yeah.

00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:46.229 align:middle
[DIVA]
I thought she was stuck

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:47.939 align:middle
struggling with the
basic of problems,

00:10:48.023 --> 00:10:50.400 align:middle
but I see there's hope.

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:51.776 align:middle
Let's go!

00:10:54.863 --> 00:10:56.489 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
The Singularity Project...

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:58.575 align:middle
...will succeed.

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:04.205 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Yee-haw!

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:30.440 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Thank you for trying!

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:33.026 align:middle
But maybe more like
this next time.

00:11:40.742 --> 00:11:42.702 align:middle
[growls]

00:11:42.786 --> 00:11:45.497 align:middle
[KAKITANI] Carrying out the
Singularity Project, huh?

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.333 align:middle
Give me a break!
You're Diva, aren't you?

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:51.961 align:middle
And that mission
belongs to Vivy!

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:07.352 align:middle
[KAKITANI]
It has to be Vivy!

00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:10.855 align:middle
The only one who has
the answer I need is Vivy.

00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:17.028 align:middle
[DIVA] What is it that
you want me to say?

00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:18.279 align:middle
What was that?!

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:19.948 align:middle
What did you want Vivy--

00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:23.368 align:middle
no, I mean, what do you want
your teacher to say to you?

00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:25.370 align:middle
Don't you dare!

00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:34.087 align:middle
[ANTONIO groans]

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:35.505 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
This is where it ends for you.

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:37.966 align:middle
You have no chance of
surpassing me now!

00:12:38.049 --> 00:12:39.509 align:middle
[growls]

00:12:41.052 --> 00:12:43.888 align:middle
No. You're wrong!

00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:45.432 align:middle
Ophelia's so much more!

00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:49.477 align:middle
This is nowhere near what
her voice is capable of!

00:12:49.561 --> 00:12:50.812 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Hm?

00:12:58.862 --> 00:13:01.531 align:middle
[ANTONIO] What's with
that look on your faces?

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:04.617 align:middle
Why do you all look so content?!

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:06.870 align:middle
All I wanted was to become her.

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:10.665 align:middle
Why can't my singing
even come close?

00:13:10.749 --> 00:13:12.792 align:middle
What is it that she
felt that allowed her

00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:15.253 align:middle
to sing on like that?

00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:21.593 align:middle
[yells]

00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:32.020 align:middle
[OPHELIA] Someday, I'll become
a singer truly worthy of you.

00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:34.105 align:middle
I'll do my best!

00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:35.607 align:middle
[KAKITANI] Don't try to
understand humans,

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:36.858 align:middle
you're just an AI!

00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:38.943 align:middle
Stay in line with
your programming!

00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:42.655 align:middle
If he had done that, my
teacher would still be here!

00:13:49.788 --> 00:13:53.291 align:middle
[KAKITANI] Come on, Vivy.
I want your answer.

00:14:11.726 --> 00:14:15.814 align:middle
[ANTONIO]
O... pheli... a...

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:18.525 align:middle
Ophelia.

00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:21.778 align:middle
I will... make sure
that your singing...

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:24.656 align:middle
...will be heard by more...

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:30.495 align:middle
[ANTONIO]
No, that's not right.

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:35.041 align:middle
What I truly wanted all along...

00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:42.340 align:middle
...was for you... to sing
for me... and me alone.

00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:50.056 align:middle
[OPHELIA]
Antonio...

00:14:52.267 --> 00:14:56.730 align:middle
[OPHELIA]
I was always singing for you.

00:14:56.813 --> 00:15:01.693 align:middle
The one that I wanted to
make smile most of all...

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:05.405 align:middle
...was you, Antonio,
it was always you.

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:10.869 align:middle
[OPHELIA]
So, smile for me, Antonio.

00:15:10.952 --> 00:15:15.081 align:middle
Your smile is all that I ever...

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:28.053 align:middle
[KAKITANI]
It's ironic, isn't it?

00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:31.473 align:middle
I've surpassed the boundaries
of being both human and AI,

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:33.641 align:middle
yet look what's become of me.

00:15:33.725 --> 00:15:34.642 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
I'm not going to criticize

00:15:34.726 --> 00:15:36.186 align:middle
all of the choices you made.

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:39.314 align:middle
That said, how did you find out
about the Singularity Project?

00:15:39.397 --> 00:15:42.108 align:middle
You made contact with Antonio
first so you could throw us off.

00:15:42.192 --> 00:15:43.443 align:middle
And there was that
logical bullet

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:46.029 align:middle
that was way too
advanced for this era.

00:15:47.322 --> 00:15:50.992 align:middle
[KAKITANI] I had a revelation.
A revelation from the heavens.

00:15:51.076 --> 00:15:52.577 align:middle
Of what?

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.412 align:middle
[KAKITANI]
After Vivy went into sleep mode,

00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:58.500 align:middle
and I'd lost my purpose in life,
it came to me clearly.

00:15:58.583 --> 00:16:01.419 align:middle
That on this day,
40 years in the future,

00:16:01.503 --> 00:16:05.340 align:middle
I'd get one last chance.

00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:08.385 align:middle
Does it sound like I'm
avoiding the question?

00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:13.014 align:middle
Not at all. I believe you.

00:16:13.098 --> 00:16:16.351 align:middle
[KAKITANI groans]

00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:18.269 align:middle
[KAKITANI]
Then will you tell me?

00:16:18.353 --> 00:16:23.149 align:middle
Since you're a songstress
AI like Vivy.

00:16:23.233 --> 00:16:27.362 align:middle
On that day, when my
teacher saved my life...

00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:33.284 align:middle
...did he suffer the same
way a human would have?

00:16:33.368 --> 00:16:35.203 align:middle
Or did he...?

00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:41.501 align:middle
[gasps]

00:16:41.584 --> 00:16:46.089 align:middle
Don't you forget...
that your existence

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:50.093 align:middle
led to more human suffering
than you can know.

00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:55.765 align:middle
[KAKITANI]
Don't you dare... forget...

00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:03.148 align:middle
[gasps]

00:17:07.027 --> 00:17:08.069 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Diva, hold on.

00:17:08.153 --> 00:17:09.904 align:middle
I'll analyze that
virus right now!

00:17:09.988 --> 00:17:11.614 align:middle
What about Ophelia?

00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:13.742 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] I was able
to prevent her suicide.

00:17:13.825 --> 00:17:15.660 align:middle
Good. I was worried
for a while there,

00:17:15.744 --> 00:17:16.995 align:middle
but it turns out
you're not all talk

00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:18.371 align:middle
when it comes to your mission.

00:17:18.455 --> 00:17:20.290 align:middle
Now it's time that
I carry out mine.

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:21.833 align:middle
I'm really cutting it close.

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:23.335 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Are you out of your
mind?! There's no time for--

00:17:23.418 --> 00:17:26.212 align:middle
[DIVA]
Don't sugarcoat it.

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:29.049 align:middle
You know just as well as I do.

00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:33.178 align:middle
I'm going to disappear.

00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:36.639 align:middle
This concert today is going
to be my final performance.

00:17:36.723 --> 00:17:39.351 align:middle
That might appear as if I
don't take it seriously, but--

00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:41.061 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
I assure you, it doesn't!

00:17:41.144 --> 00:17:43.063 align:middle
I know you to be true
to your mission,

00:17:43.146 --> 00:17:47.442 align:middle
and in that respect, you and
I have always been equals.

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:48.485 align:middle
I know that because--

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:51.529 align:middle
[DIVA]
You're Vivy's partner, right?

00:17:53.073 --> 00:17:57.160 align:middle
So please, Matsumoto, allow
me to carry out my mission.

00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:59.412 align:middle
If you're determined
to save this future,

00:17:59.496 --> 00:18:01.831 align:middle
then for the five minutes
I can give the audience,

00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:04.459 align:middle
let me deliver my song!

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:15.011 align:middle
And also, please take good care
of Vivy when I'm gone, okay?

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:22.227 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
What about the answer?

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.313 align:middle
We haven't gone over
the answer together yet.

00:18:29.651 --> 00:18:34.572 align:middle
You'll find the answer
in this final song.

00:18:34.656 --> 00:18:35.782 align:middle
[FESTIVAL STAFF A] Check her
dressing room again.

00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:37.534 align:middle
[DIVA]
Sorry I'm late!

00:18:40.912 --> 00:18:46.918 align:middle
[AUDIENCE cheering]

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:07.063 align:middle
[singing in Japanese]

00:19:20.869 --> 00:19:22.746 align:middle
[DIVA]
I know you're here.

00:19:26.207 --> 00:19:29.210 align:middle
[DIVA] Well, I'm just going to
go ahead and start talking then.

00:19:29.294 --> 00:19:32.088 align:middle
It doesn't look like we
have a whole lot of time.

00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:38.720 align:middle
[DIVA] Great singing,
if I do say so myself!

00:19:38.803 --> 00:19:40.555 align:middle
I mean, sure,
I'm always perfect,

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:43.058 align:middle
but today I've really
outdone myself.

00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:46.019 align:middle
Because at last, I've
finally found what it was

00:19:46.102 --> 00:19:49.481 align:middle
that was missing from my
voice this whole time.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:58.198 align:middle
[DIVA]
To be honest,

00:19:58.281 --> 00:20:00.700 align:middle
I don't know much about
what happened to you.

00:20:00.784 --> 00:20:04.371 align:middle
For a chatterbox, he can
be really tight-lipped.

00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:08.917 align:middle
[DIVA]
He's a weird cube.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.378 align:middle
He's hyper-critical
and such a nag, too.

00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:14.714 align:middle
Always going on and on about
the future and our mission.

00:20:14.798 --> 00:20:18.259 align:middle
But in the end, he's our
partner, so try to get along.

00:20:18.343 --> 00:20:21.388 align:middle
Of course, a little
bickering is expected.

00:20:21.471 --> 00:20:23.765 align:middle
Anyway, I'm going to
leave it all to you.

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:26.893 align:middle
Both my mission, and the
future that's ahead of us.

00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:28.895 align:middle
If it was just you,
I'd be worried.

00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:31.272 align:middle
Same could be said for leaving
Matsumoto on his own,

00:20:31.356 --> 00:20:34.859 align:middle
but I'm willing to compromise
if I'm getting the package deal.

00:20:39.906 --> 00:20:42.617 align:middle
[DIVA] Looks like my
time's about up, huh?

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.791 align:middle
[DIVA] Oh, yeah, one last
thing before I go.

00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:52.085 align:middle
I hear that you've
been struggling.

00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:54.587 align:middle
That you've been wondering how
you can pour your entire heart

00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:57.298 align:middle
into your singing.

00:20:57.382 --> 00:21:01.052 align:middle
You still don't get it
after hearing this song?

00:21:07.058 --> 00:21:09.394 align:middle
[DIVA]
Hey, can you hear me?

00:21:09.477 --> 00:21:11.813 align:middle
Can you hear how
wonderful I sound,

00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:14.441 align:middle
singing this song right now?

00:21:20.989 --> 00:21:24.200 align:middle
[DIVA] All right,
the rest is up to you.

00:21:24.284 --> 00:21:26.077 align:middle
Vivy.

00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:28.788 align:middle
[DIVA] Thank you for
listening, everyone!

00:21:33.335 --> 00:21:38.340 align:middle
[AUDIENCE cheering]

00:22:01.738 --> 00:22:05.617 align:middle
[VIVY]
I still don't understand, Diva.

00:23:38.001 --> 00:23:40.670 align:middle
[VIVY] I have operated until
now to fulfill my mission...

00:23:40.754 --> 00:23:42.839 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Have you lost
the ability to sing?

00:23:42.922 --> 00:23:44.382 align:middle
[VIVY]
Even now, I'm not sure.

00:23:44.466 --> 00:23:45.925 align:middle
How can I pour my heart
into my singing?

00:23:46.009 --> 00:23:47.510 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] ...but I'm afraid
you can no longer work

00:23:47.594 --> 00:23:48.970 align:middle
on the Singularity Project.

00:23:49.054 --> 00:23:50.430 align:middle
[VIVY] Osamu, would you like
to have a race against me?

00:23:50.513 --> 00:23:52.015 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Goodnight, Vivy.
