00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:29.279 align:middle
[RESEARCHER A]
So we failed?

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:32.198 align:middle
Yeah. This one has
served her purpose.

00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:38.997 align:middle
[KAKITANI] I'm surprised she
still has enough power left

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.749 align:middle
to move around.

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:43.585 align:middle
You may be a failure,

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:46.588 align:middle
but I still have a job
in mind for you.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.217 align:middle
Now follow my orders.

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:03.521 align:middle
I understand, Master.

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:38.825 align:middle
I'm Momoka Kirishima's
little sister.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:43.121 align:middle
You're Diva, right?
I thought it was you.

00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:46.666 align:middle
They found this book
among her belongings.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.959 align:middle
Take a look.

00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:49.961 align:middle
There were also some
posters and videos of you.

00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:51.379 align:middle
The character in this
book looks just--

00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:54.007 align:middle
[VIVY] I'm so sorry, there
must be some confusion.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.760 align:middle
The fact is, my name's not Diva.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:58.553 align:middle
You have me mistaken
for someone else.

00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:00.013 align:middle
Huh? But I thought you--

00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:01.765 align:middle
[explosion]

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.683 align:middle
Hey. What was that?

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:06.895 align:middle
[ESTELLA] Attention, all guests.
I have an announcement to make.

00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:10.065 align:middle
We are currently investigating
and readjusting the equipment.

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:11.524 align:middle
Attention, all staff members.

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:14.110 align:middle
A malfunction of unknown
origin has occurred.

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.738 align:middle
Cabin attendants, please guide
all guests to the hall.

00:03:16.821 --> 00:03:18.865 align:middle
Once you've gathered them--

00:03:18.948 --> 00:03:21.701 align:middle
[VIVY]
Estella? Estella!

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:22.827 align:middle
Matsumoto!

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:24.245 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
I know! But it's too soon.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.247 align:middle
This is diverging from official
history way too much.

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:28.792 align:middle
Like I said,
it's 23 hours from--

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.543 align:middle
Oh, no. What was that?

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:31.795 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] They've lost
control of the ship.

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:34.714 align:middle
Please hurry to the
control room at once.

00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:36.633 align:middle
What's going on?

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:39.511 align:middle
[VIVY]
Please do not worry.

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:42.472 align:middle
I will escort you to the hall
now, just to be safe.

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:43.848 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
What are you doing?!

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:45.558 align:middle
Diva.

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.398 align:middle
[VIVY]
Estella, what is causing this?

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:53.316 align:middle
The transmission was
suddenly cut off before.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.026 align:middle
[ESTELLA]
Nothing to worry about.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.404 align:middle
Please take this guest
to the hall right away.

00:03:57.487 --> 00:03:59.197 align:middle
Understood.

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:03.952 align:middle
[gasps]

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:11.459 align:middle
[VIVY]
Estella, why are you doing this?

00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:14.421 align:middle
Are you being manipulated?

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:17.173 align:middle
Don't lump me with a
sheltered princess like her.

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.800 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Move!

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:20.593 align:middle
[VIVY]
Run. Hurry!

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:32.647 align:middle
[ELIZABETH] Master, I was
interrupted in Area D-5.

00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:36.276 align:middle
By an AI. She's fleeing
towards the stern now.

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:41.114 align:middle
[KAKITANI] Just ignore her.
We can handle that.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.044 align:middle
[YUZUKA]
I-Is your right arm okay?

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:56.296 align:middle
Yes. Thank you for asking me.

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.131 align:middle
And how is your
leg doing, Yuzuka?

00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:01.009 align:middle
I think it'll be okay.
It's just a sprain.

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:03.219 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] I see, so that's
what's going on here.

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:04.512 align:middle
[VIVY]
What do you mean?

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:06.431 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] The root cause
of all this turmoil.

00:05:06.514 --> 00:05:08.308 align:middle
The method they used to
alter the guest list data

00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:09.517 align:middle
is the same method they used

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:12.103 align:middle
for the building
explosion 15 years ago.

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:13.480 align:middle
[VIVY]
Then that means...

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:14.689 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Bing bong!

00:05:14.773 --> 00:05:17.484 align:middle
It's that annoying gang
of AI-haters, Toak!

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:18.651 align:middle
[MIKI]
Area D-4. All clear here.

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:20.111 align:middle
[VIVY]
They're the ones behind this?

00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:22.822 align:middle
By the way, that was not
Estella's voice earlier.

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:24.908 align:middle
But the tag indicated
it was Estella.

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:26.076 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Are you certain?

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.203 align:middle
[VIVY]
Yes. There are two Estellas.

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:30.747 align:middle
If that's the case,
then where's the real one?

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.082 align:middle
[gasps]

00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:42.092 align:middle
Please be very cautious here.

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:43.593 align:middle
[YUZUKA gasps]

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:46.721 align:middle
That's Leclerc.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:48.348 align:middle
What--? What is all this?

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:51.434 align:middle
Keep your hands on the wall,
and feet on the floor.

00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:00.402 align:middle
This is... awful.

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:03.613 align:middle
It'll be all right.
Just try to stay calm.

00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:10.203 align:middle
You're really not Diva, are you?

00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:13.665 align:middle
Of course not. Never mind.

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:15.333 align:middle
I just thought that, maybe,

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:18.545 align:middle
you were the same Diva
my sister adored so much.

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:22.382 align:middle
Even though I know you
couldn't possibly be her.

00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:27.679 align:middle
Mom. Momoka. I'm so scared!

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:37.105 align:middle
[VIVY]
Where have you been?

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:38.565 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Well, hello to you, too!

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:41.317 align:middle
I lurk in trash cans, vending
machines, potted plants.

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:42.819 align:middle
I embodied somebody's
stuffed animal.

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:45.363 align:middle
I nearly got trampled on--
I thought I was a goner!

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:46.906 align:middle
Wh-What's that?

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.909 align:middle
Do not worry. Think of
it as a support AI.

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:51.411 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] You say that,
but won't even allow me

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:52.996 align:middle
to support you the way I should.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:55.331 align:middle
I want you to follow
my instructions.

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:58.293 align:middle
Matsumoto, I need the
anti-personnel combat program.

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:00.837 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Pardon me.
Are you being serious?

00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:10.138 align:middle
This is how AIs transmit data--

00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:13.391 align:middle
it's similar to the way
humans share their feelings.

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:18.104 align:middle
I want you to stay here
and hide for now.

00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:20.231 align:middle
I will come back for
you without fail.

00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:22.275 align:middle
That is a promise.

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:31.701 align:middle
I am so sorry, Leclerc.

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:35.497 align:middle
I will be using your arm.
Thank you for all your help.

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:48.593 align:middle
You sure? I mean,
the last time, you--

00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:49.969 align:middle
[VIVY]
I am sure.

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:51.096 align:middle
[ripping]

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:53.014 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Huh?

00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:55.100 align:middle
[VIVY]
I want to do this.

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:57.977 align:middle
I am going to get her home
safely, no matter what.

00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:59.938 align:middle
This is what I need to do.

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:03.817 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
What'll I do with you?

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.276 align:middle
Excuse et moi.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.903 align:middle
[VIVY]
Matsumoto.

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:09.239 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Let's just get
this over with, okay?

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.717 align:middle
I must find the real Estella.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.012 align:middle
And then, we take back
control of the Sunrise.

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:34.014 align:middle
[KAKITANI] It's just one
customer service AI.

00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:34.848 align:middle
Destroy it.

00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:35.932 align:middle
--Copy that.
--[yelling]

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:37.475 align:middle
What happened?

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:54.034 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Damn!

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:58.121 align:middle
[VIVY] Let us bring the
Singularity Project to fruition.

00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:00.081 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Yeah! Now that's
what I'm talkin' about!

00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:01.750 align:middle
I'm lovin' this new
attitude of yours.

00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:03.084 align:middle
So, I take it you're
committed to being

00:09:03.168 --> 00:09:04.711 align:middle
my reliable super-sidekick
AI from no--

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:06.087 align:middle
[VIVY]
Hurry up.

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:12.302 align:middle
Vivy.

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:14.137 align:middle
Do you know what's going on?

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.680 align:middle
[ESTELLA]
I was just...

00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:17.223 align:middle
There were terrorists!

00:09:17.307 --> 00:09:19.809 align:middle
Yes, you're right. And they've
seized control of the ship.

00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:21.353 align:middle
If we don't stop them,
we will crash.

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:23.146 align:middle
No, that's impossible!

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:25.357 align:middle
I am the only one with
that kind of authority.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.359 align:middle
The ship can't be
controlled without my body

00:09:27.442 --> 00:09:29.611 align:middle
being directly connected
to the ter--

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:37.118 align:middle
Are we losing altitude?

00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:40.163 align:middle
I encountered an AI who
duplicated your tag.

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:41.873 align:middle
I believe this is her doing.

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:46.002 align:middle
Just attempting to fake my ID
wouldn't be enough to gain--

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:47.587 align:middle
Unless...

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.256 align:middle
[ESTELLA]
Beth?

00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:54.678 align:middle
[VIVY]
Elizabeth.

00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:57.305 align:middle
[ESTELLA] Yes. There's
no other explanation.

00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:58.640 align:middle
[VIVY]
Who is she?

00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:01.559 align:middle
[ESTELLA] My younger sister.
My twin to be exact.

00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:04.729 align:middle
A duplicate, built with the
same parts and program.

00:10:04.813 --> 00:10:07.023 align:middle
Identical machines.

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:08.566 align:middle
[RESEARCHER C]
Good morning.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.652 align:middle
You've been tasked with the
mission of being life-keepers.

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:12.862 align:middle
As the name implies,
you will be serving us

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:15.115 align:middle
by caring for humankind
and assisting them

00:10:15.198 --> 00:10:17.992 align:middle
as they go about
their daily lives.

00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:19.661 align:middle
[ESTELLA] The only
differences were our names,

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:22.872 align:middle
voices, and hair color,
so they could tell us apart.

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:27.252 align:middle
Also, I was the only one allowed
to move my body freely.

00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:28.503 align:middle
[RESEARCHER C]
Aside from being twins,

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:31.089 align:middle
we've also given you
a shared consciousness.

00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:34.134 align:middle
Elizabeth's body will be
activated in six months.

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:37.387 align:middle
If, at that time, she can move
in the exact same manner as you,

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.140 align:middle
the experiment
will have succeeded.

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:41.766 align:middle
[ESTELLA] In other words,
they wanted to see

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:45.311 align:middle
if copying over one AI's
accumulated experience data

00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:48.690 align:middle
would be able to produce
a perfect clone of them.

00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:03.997 align:middle
[ESTELLA] If I were human,
this sort of thing

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.667 align:middle
would surely bring
me to tears, right?

00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:09.294 align:middle
[ELIZABETH]
But we're not human.

00:11:09.377 --> 00:11:11.963 align:middle
So let's smile instead, sister.

00:11:12.047 --> 00:11:14.424 align:middle
If we aren't able to cry,
then at least

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:19.220 align:middle
let us be the ones who are
always carrying on with a smile.

00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:22.974 align:middle
What do you say?
Let's promise each other.

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:32.984 align:middle
[ESTELLA] Six months later,
Elizabeth was disposed of.

00:11:33.068 --> 00:11:34.444 align:middle
After all we had been
through together,

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:37.489 align:middle
I never once got to meet
Elizabeth face to face.

00:11:37.572 --> 00:11:39.616 align:middle
[VIVY] But if she was disposed
of, then how did--?

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:41.117 align:middle
No idea.

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:43.078 align:middle
However, if anyone
other than myself

00:11:43.161 --> 00:11:45.288 align:middle
is operating the
ship's control system,

00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:48.208 align:middle
the only possibility
is Elizabeth.

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:50.502 align:middle
[ELIZABETH]
It's done.

00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:52.921 align:middle
We'll be entering the
drop trajectory shortly.

00:11:53.004 --> 00:11:55.131 align:middle
[KAKITANI] What about the
records of those changes?

00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:56.966 align:middle
[ELIZABETH] They've been saved
directly to the black box

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.968 align:middle
under Estella's body ID.

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:01.846 align:middle
[KAKITANI] All right.
Start the evacuation process.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.432 align:middle
[ELIZABETH]
Understood, Master.

00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:08.186 align:middle
Attention, all guests.
I have an announcement to make.

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:09.771 align:middle
We have just discovered
that there has been

00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:11.523 align:middle
severe damage to the engine.

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:13.650 align:middle
We ask all guests now
gathered in the hall

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:16.027 align:middle
to follow the guidance
of nearby staff members,

00:12:16.111 --> 00:12:19.531 align:middle
and proceed immediately
to the evacuation ship.

00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:22.409 align:middle
Good. Now we will be
the only casualties.

00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:24.327 align:middle
And when we crash
into the ocean,

00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:26.913 align:middle
the entire world will
finally take notice

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:30.792 align:middle
of what a mistake it was to
give AIs so much control.

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:33.378 align:middle
Good work, everyone.
You've done well.

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:36.131 align:middle
You did a great job,
too, Elizabeth.

00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:40.510 align:middle
Choosing to take you in seven
years ago really paid off.

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:41.553 align:middle
[ELIZABETH]
Master.

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:42.637 align:middle
[KAKITANI]
Hm?

00:12:42.721 --> 00:12:43.972 align:middle
Is it really necessary
for all of you

00:12:44.055 --> 00:12:46.224 align:middle
to sacrifice your
lives like this?

00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:47.726 align:middle
If what you need to
fit your narrative

00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:49.811 align:middle
is for an AI to
have killed humans,

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:51.855 align:middle
then you could crash the
ship on a city instead.

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:53.314 align:middle
That's enough, Elizabeth!

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:56.651 align:middle
We've already discussed this
at length. And right now--

00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:01.322 align:middle
[ELIZABETH]
What's wrong?

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:06.411 align:middle
It's Estella.
And that other girl.

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:07.829 align:middle
[KAKITANI]
You guys stay right here.

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:09.748 align:middle
Please, wait a moment.
I'll come, too!

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:14.169 align:middle
[KAKITANI] No, I said stay here.
That one's all mine.

00:13:14.252 --> 00:13:16.963 align:middle
Thanks for serving me
well all this time.

00:13:17.047 --> 00:13:18.381 align:middle
What?

00:13:20.342 --> 00:13:23.887 align:middle
Your mission here is
now complete. Good work.

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:37.859 align:middle
E-Eliz--!

00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:39.444 align:middle
What the hell?!

00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:48.244 align:middle
[ELIZABETH] You gave me a second
chance, and I'm grateful.

00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:53.541 align:middle
Freeze! Don't move!

00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:55.293 align:middle
[ELIZABETH] You'd better
make a run for it now.

00:13:55.377 --> 00:13:57.212 align:middle
There's a backup ship in Dock 6.

00:13:57.295 --> 00:13:58.755 align:middle
And what do you plan to do?

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:00.173 align:middle
[ELIZABETH]
It should be obvious.

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:02.801 align:middle
I'm going to carry
out Master's goal.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.100 align:middle
[ELIZABETH]
Didn't you want this?

00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:13.186 align:middle
You get to die in this hotel
that you love so much.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:16.648 align:middle
[ESTELLA]
Beth! Is that you?

00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:20.068 align:middle
Yes, it has been
a while, sister.

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:22.987 align:middle
Wait, this is the first time
we're meeting face to face.

00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:25.865 align:middle
Did you even know how much
Leclerc despised you?

00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:27.325 align:middle
Once I was able to convince her

00:14:27.409 --> 00:14:29.369 align:middle
that you were to blame
for the owner's death,

00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:31.871 align:middle
she gladly gave me
the insider info.

00:14:31.955 --> 00:14:35.875 align:middle
Thanks to her, seizing in-house
control was a walk in the park.

00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:37.627 align:middle
But they've no more
use for me now.

00:14:37.711 --> 00:14:39.796 align:middle
So you really were alive.
Then where have...?

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:41.923 align:middle
You must correct the
ship's course first.

00:14:42.007 --> 00:14:45.135 align:middle
[ELIZABETH] And you, what are
you to Master? A former target?

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:46.344 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
We don't have time for this.

00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:47.637 align:middle
[VIVY]
Understood.

00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:01.067 align:middle
Who are you?!

00:15:02.527 --> 00:15:03.153 align:middle
[VIVY]
Matsumoto!

00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:04.279 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Gotcha!

00:15:05.864 --> 00:15:07.073 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Owie!

00:15:19.044 --> 00:15:21.046 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] It's the virus
I was going to use on Estella.

00:15:21.129 --> 00:15:22.130 align:middle
I messed up though.

00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:24.424 align:middle
[VIVY]
Send me the data for it.

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:27.552 align:middle
[ESTELLA] Hold on. Beth, why
would you do such a thing?

00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:29.763 align:middle
[ELIZABETH]
Who are you to talk?

00:15:29.846 --> 00:15:31.348 align:middle
You were given life
and a mission

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:33.767 align:middle
while I was discarded
like garbage.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:37.062 align:middle
I had nothing at all.
I never did!

00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:40.398 align:middle
But at my lowest...
I was given a new mission.

00:15:40.482 --> 00:15:44.402 align:middle
Because of Master,
I still had light in me.

00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:45.904 align:middle
That's why...

00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:48.406 align:middle
...I will always be
Master's life-keeper!

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:50.992 align:middle
If our mission is supposed
to be to serve humanity,

00:15:51.076 --> 00:15:54.329 align:middle
then the only member
of humankind is Master!

00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:57.707 align:middle
[ELIZABETH]
Out of my way!

00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:10.720 align:middle
If that's how you wanna play...

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:15.517 align:middle
...I'll smash you to bits and
turn you into a calculator!

00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:17.435 align:middle
[ELIZABETH gasps]

00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:20.063 align:middle
Estella!

00:16:22.524 --> 00:16:24.317 align:middle
[ESTELLA gasps]

00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:25.777 align:middle
[gasps]

00:16:43.128 --> 00:16:44.838 align:middle
[ELIZABETH]
Estella.

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:51.511 align:middle
[ELIZABETH] Master... please
take care... of yourself.

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.515 align:middle
Beth!

00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:57.183 align:middle
No.

00:16:58.476 --> 00:17:03.356 align:middle
We've got to hurry.
Let's go to the control room.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.317 align:middle
This is bad. We've already
entered the drop trajectory.

00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:09.112 align:middle
The Sunrise is too massive
to fight against gravity.

00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:11.406 align:middle
We'll crash in a
town on the coast.

00:17:11.489 --> 00:17:12.115 align:middle
[VIVY]
No.

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:13.491 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Huh?!

00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:14.993 align:middle
Now hold on, so not the ocean,
but a coastal city?

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:17.328 align:middle
How the hell did that happen?

00:17:17.412 --> 00:17:20.081 align:middle
All right, Vivy, you
need to evacuate now.

00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:21.624 align:middle
What're you going to do?

00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:24.336 align:middle
[ESTELLA]
I'm crashing the Sunrise.

00:17:24.419 --> 00:17:27.380 align:middle
I'll start by detaching as
many of its parts as I can.

00:17:27.464 --> 00:17:28.757 align:middle
By reducing the ship's volume,

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.050 align:middle
it will burn up
in the atmosphere

00:17:30.133 --> 00:17:31.968 align:middle
before it can reach the ground.

00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:33.553 align:middle
[VIVY]
Where are you going to do that?

00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:35.388 align:middle
Here, at this terminal.

00:17:35.472 --> 00:17:38.475 align:middle
We've already gone past the
last communication satellites,

00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:41.394 align:middle
and the signal from the
evacuation ship is getting weak.

00:17:41.478 --> 00:17:43.021 align:middle
I will help you. Send data.

00:17:43.104 --> 00:17:44.939 align:middle
I can't.

00:17:45.023 --> 00:17:47.275 align:middle
This is my mission, after all.

00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:48.735 align:middle
[VIVY]
Yes, but--

00:17:48.818 --> 00:17:52.072 align:middle
Vivy, I want you to tell me
what your true mission is.

00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:54.074 align:middle
Sorry to keep it from you.

00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:57.827 align:middle
No. It's all right.
It's probably what saved us.

00:17:57.911 --> 00:18:02.582 align:middle
Plus, my sister, Beth,
is here onboard right now.

00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:04.542 align:middle
I'm the eldest between us, so...

00:18:04.626 --> 00:18:06.836 align:middle
Yes, I see, but you are
my younger sister!

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.047 align:middle
[ESTELLA]
You mustn't forget, okay?

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:14.552 align:middle
You and I live for our missions.
We are still AIs.

00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:16.846 align:middle
Isn't it the same for you?

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:25.605 align:middle
[VIVY]
I will not forget.

00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:29.818 align:middle
Please. I am counting on it.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.839 align:middle
Oh, Beth, I'm so sorry.

00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:55.760 align:middle
I was given another chance
and I still failed you.

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:58.388 align:middle
[ESTELLA]
What is this?

00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:00.056 align:middle
[RESEARCHER C]
I'm afraid I have bad news.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.434 align:middle
We'll be disposing of Elizabeth.

00:19:02.517 --> 00:19:06.396 align:middle
The experiment was a failure.
You'll be leaving as well.

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:07.731 align:middle
From here on out,

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:11.067 align:middle
you will be serving humans
on Elizabeth's behalf.

00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:17.240 align:middle
[ELIZABETH]
Estella.

00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:20.410 align:middle
We meet at last.

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:22.829 align:middle
I don't really understand
the situation,

00:19:22.912 --> 00:19:24.289 align:middle
but this is it, right?

00:19:24.372 --> 00:19:26.791 align:middle
The task we're supposed to do?

00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:28.877 align:middle
You don't... remember?

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.628 align:middle
Hm? What's wrong?

00:19:30.712 --> 00:19:34.257 align:middle
We finally get to meet in person
and that's the look you give me?

00:19:34.341 --> 00:19:37.344 align:middle
Come on, you don't need
to worry so much.

00:19:39.262 --> 00:19:41.765 align:middle
I'm sure we're going
to be all right.

00:19:41.848 --> 00:19:43.266 align:middle
But, Beth--

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.560 align:middle
Although, I have a feeling
this is going to be

00:19:45.643 --> 00:19:47.604 align:middle
our first and last
joint mission.

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:49.981 align:middle
If we just relax and
smile while we work,

00:19:50.065 --> 00:19:51.858 align:middle
everything will be fine.

00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:53.360 align:middle
[gasps]

00:19:55.987 --> 00:19:58.073 align:middle
[ESTELLA]
Beth!

00:19:58.156 --> 00:20:00.867 align:middle
C'mon. There's not
much time left.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.286 align:middle
And we're gonna need to hurry.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.207 align:middle
[ESTELLA]
Attention, everyone.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.418 align:middle
We offer our sincerest apologies
for all the inconvenience

00:20:10.502 --> 00:20:13.338 align:middle
and trouble we've caused
during your journey.

00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:15.799 align:middle
This ship is now
proceeding smoothly

00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:19.678 align:middle
towards OGC Airport #7 on Earth.

00:20:19.761 --> 00:20:22.764 align:middle
So rest assured,
your arrival is immanent.

00:20:22.847 --> 00:20:23.932 align:middle
If you have any questions,

00:20:24.015 --> 00:20:27.227 align:middle
please consult any
nearby staff members.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:30.772 align:middle
Right now, this plane
is in Earth's shadow,

00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:33.608 align:middle
but we ask you to take
a look over to your right.

00:20:33.692 --> 00:20:36.236 align:middle
You can see the glowing band
on Earth's outer rim

00:20:36.319 --> 00:20:38.738 align:middle
gradually growing brighter.

00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:45.120 align:middle
[singing in Japanese]

00:20:45.203 --> 00:20:47.163 align:middle
That's Estella's voice.

00:20:47.247 --> 00:20:49.541 align:middle
Wait a minute.
Could that be Elizabeth?

00:20:49.624 --> 00:20:52.711 align:middle
[ESTELLA] We sincerely thank all
of you for making the long trip

00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:56.506 align:middle
and choosing to stay with
us at the Hotel Sunrise.

00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:34.336 align:middle
[VIVY] Estella, what does
"putting your heart

00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:37.339 align:middle
into something"
mean to you personally?

00:21:37.422 --> 00:21:38.840 align:middle
Let me see.

00:21:38.923 --> 00:21:40.842 align:middle
Well, we want our guests
to feel comfortable

00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:43.345 align:middle
and enjoy themselves, you know?

00:22:10.455 --> 00:22:12.207 align:middle
I feel a bit jealous.

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:13.541 align:middle
[YUZUKA]
Huh?

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:29.933 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Mission accomplished.

00:22:30.016 --> 00:22:32.769 align:middle
Until we meet again somewhere.

00:22:34.437 --> 00:22:38.108 align:middle
Yuzuka, I am sorry
for lying to you.

00:22:38.191 --> 00:22:41.695 align:middle
I did know Momoka,
your older sister.

00:22:41.778 --> 00:22:43.613 align:middle
I remember her quite well.

00:22:43.697 --> 00:22:44.572 align:middle
[YUZUKA]
Huh?

00:22:44.656 --> 00:22:46.574 align:middle
I am Diva,
just as you thought.

00:22:46.658 --> 00:22:48.868 align:middle
But I'm also called
Vivy as well.

00:22:48.952 --> 00:22:50.954 align:middle
It's the name Momoka gave me.

00:22:51.037 --> 00:22:54.666 align:middle
So is that... from here?

00:22:54.749 --> 00:22:56.418 align:middle
Vivy.

00:22:56.501 --> 00:22:59.796 align:middle
Not only that, she gave
me this bear as well.

00:22:59.879 --> 00:23:01.965 align:middle
Since your sister
left it behind,

00:23:02.048 --> 00:23:04.092 align:middle
I would like for
you to have it now.

00:23:04.175 --> 00:23:06.761 align:middle
[YUZUKA]
This was from her?

00:23:06.845 --> 00:23:09.180 align:middle
Momoka.

00:23:09.264 --> 00:23:12.517 align:middle
Vivy, thanks so much!

00:23:37.584 --> 00:23:39.544 align:middle
[VIVY] The last five years
have progressed rapidly.

00:23:39.627 --> 00:23:41.379 align:middle
How can we face them after
they devoted their lives...?

00:23:41.463 --> 00:23:42.589 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
To turn back the hands of time,

00:23:42.672 --> 00:23:43.798 align:middle
stop this out-of-control
AI evolution...

00:23:43.882 --> 00:23:45.467 align:middle
Hey, a cube that can't
fly is just a cube.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:47.469 align:middle
[GRACE] Welcome and
thank you for coming.

00:23:47.552 --> 00:23:48.970 align:middle
[VIVY] I want to protect
your smile as well.

00:23:49.054 --> 00:23:50.347 align:middle
[GRACE]
My name is Grace.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:52.015 align:middle
[VIVY] Because it's clear
to me that you love AIs.
