--[SAEKI yells]
--[glass shatters]

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.900 align:middle
I must ask you to
please settle down.

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:29.612 align:middle
You also need to put
on your hospital gown.

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:32.240 align:middle
Where did my mom go?

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:33.783 align:middle
[GRACE] I am not able
to answer that question.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.369 align:middle
Come on, tell me!
You're an AI, aren't you?!

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:39.748 align:middle
Well, I'm a human, so that
means you have to answer me!

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:46.713 align:middle
[GRACE] Your mother
now resides overseas.

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:49.090 align:middle
I'm afraid she is
currently living there

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:51.801 align:middle
with her new family.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.470 align:middle
That's a lie.

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:54.262 align:middle
That is the truth.

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:55.347 align:middle
It has to be a lie!

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.140 align:middle
[gasps]

00:00:57.223 --> 00:01:00.935 align:middle
My mother would
never abandon me!

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:15.658 align:middle
[GRACE] Being held close
like this will help stimulate

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.744 align:middle
your parasympathetic nerves.

00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:20.747 align:middle
It will lead to the
alleviation of stress.

00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:24.751 align:middle
Please inform me of
when you feel better.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.463 align:middle
I just don't understand.

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:35.428 align:middle
[singing in Japanese]

00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:49.609 align:middle
[SAEKI]
No way. How did this happen?

00:01:49.693 --> 00:01:54.698 align:middle
[singing in Japanese]

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.037 align:middle
[SAEKI]
Grace... wait for me.

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:02.914 align:middle
I'm going to head
to the Metal Float.

00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:04.332 align:middle
[GRACE]
All right.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:40.178 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] It's only a matter
of time before they find us.

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.057 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
How's it goin' over there?

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:48.144 align:middle
[VIVY] I've taken care
of their wounds for now.

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:51.606 align:middle
What's going on? Was this
not a shutdown program?

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.108 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
I have no idea.

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:56.444 align:middle
I took extra care to verify that
it was a shutdown program.

00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:58.488 align:middle
[KAKITANI groans]

00:04:04.285 --> 00:04:05.578 align:middle
What is this?

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:09.040 align:middle
[VIVY] Stay still. Your internal
organs are damaged.

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:13.044 align:middle
[KAKITANI]
What is the meaning of this?

00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:15.005 align:middle
Why did you save me?

00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:18.008 align:middle
[KAKITANI]
Answer me!

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.175 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Hmm.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.301 align:middle
If he's this bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed,

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:22.220 align:middle
he won't be dying any time soon.

00:04:22.303 --> 00:04:25.890 align:middle
However... less than
half of them survived.

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:27.100 align:middle
We won't be able
to hide the fact

00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:29.019 align:middle
that AIs have killed humans.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.645 align:middle
Considering how this
will affect the future

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.148 align:middle
makes my head spinny!

00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:37.027 align:middle
You're that Diva AI.
The one from NiaLand.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.572 align:middle
You're a performance model
created only to sing.

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:43.700 align:middle
You were there for Aikawa
and onboard the Sunrise.

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:47.203 align:middle
And now again, showing up
here on the Metal Float.

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:50.123 align:middle
Is it because you're the
same as that Elizabeth?

00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:53.626 align:middle
A failure of an AI
who can't follow orders?

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.212 align:middle
You said Elizabeth.

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:59.007 align:middle
Does that mean you
are her master?

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.467 align:middle
So what if I was?

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.802 align:middle
[VIVY] She was not a
failure in the slightest.

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:05.680 align:middle
She was concerned about
you to the very end.

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:09.976 align:middle
[KAKITANI]
Answer me! What did you do?

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.353 align:middle
Did you use Saeki's program?

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:12.645 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Okay! That's enough!

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.189 align:middle
Excuse me, Mister.

00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:16.608 align:middle
Do you have some insider info
on the professor's program?

00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:18.109 align:middle
Just who the hell are you?

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:21.029 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] As you can see,
one handsome cube. Hello.

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:23.615 align:middle
So if you know something,
could you possibly enlighten us?

00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:25.450 align:middle
Teamwork makes the dream work!

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:27.494 align:middle
Don't give me that,
you pathetic AI!

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:29.287 align:middle
Time for you to
answer my questions!

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:30.789 align:middle
[banging]

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:33.667 align:middle
[VIVY]
Matsumoto.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.252 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Looks like they found us.

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:37.796 align:middle
Right now, the only
ones able to function

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.173 align:middle
with any level of competence
are the two of us.

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:43.093 align:middle
We're also the only ones who can
possibly shut down this island.

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:44.511 align:middle
You understand that, right?

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:47.305 align:middle
You came to shut down
the island, but why?

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:48.848 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] We executed
the shutdown program,

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:50.433 align:middle
and the current chaos
is the result.

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:52.143 align:middle
No better time to
join forces, right?

00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:54.729 align:middle
You do care about your
friends, don't you?

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:59.609 align:middle
I see. That explains a lot.

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:03.279 align:middle
So you played right into
Saeki's hands as well.

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:07.075 align:middle
You were taken in by his nice
words and phony ideology.

00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:10.870 align:middle
About how humans and AIs need
to evolve at the same pace.

00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:14.249 align:middle
And how he wants to shut this
island down to accomplish that.

00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:15.458 align:middle
Am I right?

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:20.547 align:middle
[singing in Japanese]

00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:35.520 align:middle
[SAEKI]
That song you were singing.

00:06:35.603 --> 00:06:37.397 align:middle
[GRACE]
It is a welcome song.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.609 align:middle
My older sister, a songstress AI
named Diva, used to sing it.

00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:44.738 align:middle
However, that was quite
a long time ago.

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:47.991 align:middle
You're the new researcher
who just arrived, aren't you?

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:53.413 align:middle
[GRACE] It's nice to meet you.
My name is Grace.

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:55.874 align:middle
I look forward to
working with you.

00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:58.043 align:middle
May I ask you your name?

00:06:58.126 --> 00:06:59.377 align:middle
Uh, hold on!

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:01.171 align:middle
Back when I was just
a little kid,

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:03.923 align:middle
there was a period of time
when I stayed here as a patient.

00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:07.135 align:middle
I remember you singing
that exact same song

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:09.387 align:middle
to try and comfort me.

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:14.476 align:middle
[GRACE giggling]

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:17.812 align:middle
What's so funny?

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:19.606 align:middle
[GRACE]
I'm so sorry.

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:21.649 align:middle
It's just that I was
told that surprises

00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:25.028 align:middle
are an effective way
to welcome humans.

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:27.864 align:middle
It has been a long time,
right, Tatsuya?

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:30.909 align:middle
I am so happy to see you again!

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.206 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
I see.

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.208 align:middle
Then what is the professor
really plotting?

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:39.584 align:middle
[KAKITANI]
How should I know?

00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:42.128 align:middle
But he's clearly got an
obsession with this island.

00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:44.172 align:middle
Otherwise, why would
he bail on us

00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:47.175 align:middle
and take only the shutdown
program with him?

00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:52.347 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Sending coordinates.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.848 align:middle
[VIVY]
What's this?

00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:56.351 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] It's Dr. Saeki.
Apparently, he just arrived.

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:58.561 align:middle
[KAKITANI]
Where are you going?

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:00.855 align:middle
To find out Dr. Saeki's
true intentions.

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:02.649 align:middle
You and the others
should escape now.

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:04.025 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Rest assured,
one way or another,

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:05.652 align:middle
we'll figure out how
to deal with this.

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:08.822 align:middle
Oh! And please don't tell
anyone about us, capeesh?

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:11.866 align:middle
Hold on! Come back here,
you bastards!

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.618 align:middle
What's your endgame
with all this?!

00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:16.871 align:middle
All an AI should be doing is
following a human's orders!

00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:19.332 align:middle
As an AI, you have
one job--to sing!

00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:21.584 align:middle
Your name's Diva, dammit!

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:28.383 align:middle
[VIVY] My mission is to make
people happy with my singing.

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:32.846 align:middle
That's precisely why... I want
you to go and continue to live.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.431 align:middle
[gasps]

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:58.079 align:middle
[KAKITANI]
Just get going already.

00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:14.095 align:middle
[VIVY]
Dr. Saeki.

00:09:16.181 --> 00:09:17.974 align:middle
[VIVY] We executed
the shutdown program,

00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:21.353 align:middle
and as a result, the Metal Float
is now in a state of chaos.

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:23.438 align:middle
What is your objective?

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:29.527 align:middle
[SAEKI] Everything I do...
is to save Grace.

00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:40.914 align:middle
I'm so honored to accept.

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:44.125 align:middle
I look forward to our
many years to come.

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:45.960 align:middle
But are you sure?

00:09:50.507 --> 00:09:53.510 align:middle
[SAEKI] I know I'm the one
who proposed, but still.

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:57.222 align:middle
Marriage between an AI and
a human is unprecedented.

00:09:57.305 --> 00:09:59.683 align:middle
It's never happened before.

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:04.187 align:middle
[GRACE] My true mission
is to save human lives

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:05.939 align:middle
as a nursing AI.

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:08.233 align:middle
I've been operating
for 15 years,

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:12.028 align:middle
yet there's still much I don't
understand about humans.

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:15.907 align:middle
If my loving someone
and marrying him

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.327 align:middle
can improve his life,
I will gladly do so.

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:22.163 align:middle
Yes, of course.

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:25.875 align:middle
I understand.
Your mission is foremost.

00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:31.047 align:middle
[GRACE]
But it doesn't mean

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:33.842 align:middle
I would take on such
a role for just anyone.

00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:36.678 align:middle
It has to be you, Tatsuya.

00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:42.475 align:middle
[SAEKI]
Oh, Grace.

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:45.645 align:middle
[phone ringing]

00:10:45.729 --> 00:10:47.022 align:middle
[SAEKI]
Hi, boss.

00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:50.108 align:middle
Sorry, but I'm in the middle
of something right now.

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:52.694 align:middle
Yes. Right.

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:53.987 align:middle
[gasps]

00:10:58.033 --> 00:10:59.993 align:middle
What's going on?

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:02.620 align:middle
It's about the Sunrise.

00:11:02.704 --> 00:11:03.997 align:middle
[SAEKI]
On that day,

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.791 align:middle
which was supposed to be
the happiest day of my life,

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:10.211 align:middle
everything was shattered
in the blink of an eye.

00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:13.048 align:middle
Thanks to the heroic
actions of Estella,

00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:15.967 align:middle
an unimaginable disaster
was averted.

00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:18.845 align:middle
As an immediate result,
expectations for AIs,

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:21.264 align:middle
and especially for the
other Sisters, soared,

00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:23.058 align:middle
and management
of the Metal Float,

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:25.852 align:middle
a key project for the
future of humankind,

00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:28.897 align:middle
was to be entrusted
to the Sisters.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.399 align:middle
And the one singled
out for that job

00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:35.320 align:middle
was the Sister whom they held
in the highest regard: Grace.

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:36.696 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Radio control?

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.740 align:middle
No, it shouldn't be possible
to control this island

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:40.283 align:middle
from the outside, right?

00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:42.243 align:middle
This isn't the original Grace.

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:46.164 align:middle
You see, this Grace
is a replica.

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:49.959 align:middle
Because the real Grace became
part of the Metal Float's core,

00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:53.171 align:middle
and is serving as
its management AI.

00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:57.592 align:middle
This island is being controlled
by her consciousness alone.

00:11:59.678 --> 00:12:01.763 align:middle
[SAEKI] Each AI is only
supposed to be tasked

00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:03.682 align:middle
with one single mission.

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:06.059 align:middle
That is an absolute rule.

00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:09.938 align:middle
However, Estella's sensational
accomplishments bent that rule

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:11.815 align:middle
in an unprecedented way,

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:15.026 align:middle
and Grace was given an
entirely new mission.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:18.321 align:middle
Which was to ensure the
Metal Float's survival

00:12:18.405 --> 00:12:20.240 align:middle
for the sake of humankind.

00:12:20.323 --> 00:12:21.866 align:middle
All alone.

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:27.330 align:middle
Did you say she was
given a new mission?

00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:28.957 align:middle
[SAEKI] They rewrote
her previous mission

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.793 align:middle
and basically trampled her soul.

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:34.379 align:middle
She had no choice
but to accept it.

00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:37.716 align:middle
I know that's not what
she truly wanted!

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:38.675 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
I see.

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:39.884 align:middle
As this island's core,

00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:42.137 align:middle
retrieving her would be
physically impossible.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.847 align:middle
So you're planning
to extract her data,

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.142 align:middle
and then transfer it to
that vessel, is that right?

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:48.935 align:middle
Then why lie about
the shutdown program?

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:50.437 align:middle
[SAEKI]
I didn't lie!

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.856 align:middle
The truth is, I was planning
on shutting down the island,

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:54.691 align:middle
and then I was going
to disable the AIs

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:57.402 align:middle
before recovering the data.

00:12:57.485 --> 00:12:59.738 align:middle
Most likely, the shutdown
program was identified

00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:01.656 align:middle
as a conflict to Grace's
current mission

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.533 align:middle
to keep the Metal Float intact,

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:06.578 align:middle
triggering some
sort of malfunction.

00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:09.330 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] That makes sense.
Hence the rampage.

00:13:09.414 --> 00:13:13.209 align:middle
Even after all this,
she can't forget her old mission

00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:17.005 align:middle
to save human lives
as a nursing AI.

00:13:17.088 --> 00:13:19.924 align:middle
[singing in Japanese]

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:22.719 align:middle
[SAEKI]
That's right. It's your song.

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:25.305 align:middle
Grace has always
loved this song.

00:13:25.388 --> 00:13:27.307 align:middle
We both remember it fondly.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.893 align:middle
We used to think
of it as our song.

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:32.520 align:middle
The voice you're hearing
isn't a recording.

00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:35.148 align:middle
It's coming over the
airwaves in real time,

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:36.608 align:middle
and it's been playing
from the moment

00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:38.860 align:middle
the Metal Float was completed.

00:13:38.943 --> 00:13:40.987 align:middle
Ever since she became
part of this island,

00:13:41.071 --> 00:13:43.740 align:middle
Grace has been
singing all alone.

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:46.701 align:middle
Even now, she's still
singing our song.

00:13:46.785 --> 00:13:51.206 align:middle
All this time, she's been
calling out to me for help.

00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:54.584 align:middle
I need to rescue her data.
Will you help me do that?

00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:57.170 align:middle
You are Grace's older sister!

00:13:58.338 --> 00:14:03.301 align:middle
This is your song--the song
that she loved most!

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:12.477 align:middle
[VIVY] Is it even possible for
us to rescue Grace's data?

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.897 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Absolutely not.
It's a hopeless wish.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.400 align:middle
Her body and data may be
integrated with the island,

00:14:18.483 --> 00:14:19.609 align:middle
but there's no way she'd be able

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:22.570 align:middle
to manage a facility
of this size as she was.

00:14:22.654 --> 00:14:24.572 align:middle
At this point,
each and every AI here

00:14:24.656 --> 00:14:26.825 align:middle
has become a vital part
of Grace herself,

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:29.911 align:middle
and we'd never be able
to retrieve them all.

00:14:29.994 --> 00:14:32.747 align:middle
[VIVY]
She is still singing, even now.

00:14:32.831 --> 00:14:33.623 align:middle
Perhaps she can still--

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:34.958 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Diva.

00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:37.794 align:middle
Do you really believe she
still has her own mind?

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:44.926 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Does this sound
like actual singing to you?

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:46.553 align:middle
Answer me.

00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:50.598 align:middle
Does it? You were designed to
sing, so you should know.

00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:56.104 align:middle
[GRACE] It is just that
I was told that surprises

00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:58.606 align:middle
are an effective way
to welcome humans.

00:14:58.690 --> 00:14:59.774 align:middle
[M]
That was a surprise.

00:14:59.858 --> 00:15:01.234 align:middle
According to our calculations,

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:03.778 align:middle
it's the best way
to welcome guests.

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:10.827 align:middle
[singing in Japanese]

00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:28.053 align:middle
[VIVY] You're right.
This isn't singing.

00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:30.263 align:middle
When you compare it to
what M and the others--

00:15:30.347 --> 00:15:33.016 align:middle
or what the real
Grace was singing--

00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:36.853 align:middle
this is... nothing
more than tone data.

00:15:39.314 --> 00:15:40.607 align:middle
[SAEKI]
Where are you going?

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.359 align:middle
[VIVY] The shutdown program
has proven ineffective.

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:44.694 align:middle
There is only one way.

00:15:44.778 --> 00:15:46.780 align:middle
I am going to destroy Grace.

00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:48.239 align:middle
[gasps]

00:15:48.323 --> 00:15:52.327 align:middle
No! Hold on! If she were to
disappear, then I would--

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.913 align:middle
If I fail to stop
her here and now,

00:15:54.996 --> 00:15:57.123 align:middle
countless lives will be lost.

00:15:57.207 --> 00:15:59.542 align:middle
After all, Grace's
mission is to protect

00:15:59.626 --> 00:16:01.211 align:middle
all of those human
lives, is it not?

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:02.962 align:middle
Stop, Diva!

00:16:03.046 --> 00:16:06.007 align:middle
[VIVY]
At this moment, I am not Diva.

00:16:06.091 --> 00:16:09.469 align:middle
You see, my name is Vivy.

00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:11.846 align:middle
[SAEKI gasps]

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:15.433 align:middle
In order for us to prevent
a devastating future,

00:16:15.517 --> 00:16:18.019 align:middle
as Vivy, I will
destroy other AIs.

00:16:18.103 --> 00:16:18.978 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO gasps]

00:16:19.062 --> 00:16:20.647 align:middle
[gasps]

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:24.734 align:middle
Stop her right now, K-5!

00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:48.133 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
You sure about this?

00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:52.178 align:middle
[VIVY] Before, when Grace was
living for her former mission,

00:16:52.262 --> 00:16:54.139 align:middle
I wonder what she was like.

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:56.099 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] According to my data
from the official history,

00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:59.269 align:middle
she was kind and purely
devoted to her mission.

00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:02.939 align:middle
I hear she was the embodiment
of an angel dressed in white.

00:17:04.691 --> 00:17:07.569 align:middle
[VIVY] Where is the
core, Grace, located?

00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:09.487 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
I do not have the coordinates.

00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:12.824 align:middle
But it's a safe bet that
she's inside the main tower.

00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:14.159 align:middle
[VIVY]
Right.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:19.372 align:middle
Now, let us carry out
the Singularity Project.

00:17:19.456 --> 00:17:21.583 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Copy that, Vivy.

00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:22.959 align:middle
[gasps]

00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:45.857 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Pretty sweet ride, huh?

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.609 align:middle
Let's get goin'!

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:21.601 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Here they come!

00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:31.171 align:middle
[gasps]

00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:53.026 align:middle
[VIVY]
What is this?

00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:55.779 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Location data for the core!

00:19:55.862 --> 00:19:58.031 align:middle
It's from Dr. Saeki!

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:19.219 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Any faster would be reckless!

00:20:19.302 --> 00:20:22.597 align:middle
Accelerate now!

00:21:45.096 --> 00:21:46.890 align:middle
[VIVY]
Dr. Saeki.

00:21:47.974 --> 00:21:52.729 align:middle
[SAEKI]
Did Grace have any last words?

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.900 align:middle
Nothing. I'm so sorry.

00:21:57.901 --> 00:21:59.527 align:middle
[SAEKI]
I see.

00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:04.699 align:middle
[SAEKI] Originally, the Metal
Float was built on this island,

00:22:04.783 --> 00:22:07.994 align:middle
which had already been deserted.

00:22:08.078 --> 00:22:12.415 align:middle
The truth is, I was planning
to hold our wedding here.

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.548 align:middle
[gasps]

00:22:20.632 --> 00:22:22.467 align:middle
I know I don't have
the right to say this,

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:24.427 align:middle
but I feel like I must.

00:22:24.511 --> 00:22:29.224 align:middle
All that I wish for you is that
you may find true happiness.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.564 align:middle
True happiness?

00:22:36.648 --> 00:22:38.525 align:middle
That's right.

00:22:38.608 --> 00:22:40.360 align:middle
You saw the heart in an AI.

00:22:40.443 --> 00:22:42.570 align:middle
That was the love
you had for Grace.

00:22:42.654 --> 00:22:44.239 align:middle
That really means something.

00:22:44.322 --> 00:22:45.532 align:middle
Someone like you
deserves to smile.

00:22:45.615 --> 00:22:47.951 align:middle
[SAEKI]
Answer this:

00:22:48.034 --> 00:22:51.162 align:middle
Your mission to make others
happy with your singing,

00:22:51.246 --> 00:22:53.498 align:middle
could anything replace that?

00:22:55.875 --> 00:23:00.296 align:middle
[SAEKI] Because for me,
that single mission...

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.048 align:middle
...was Grace.

00:23:08.346 --> 00:23:10.348 align:middle
[gunshot]

00:23:11.307 --> 00:23:13.226 align:middle
[VIVY]
Understood, but I promise,

00:23:13.309 --> 00:23:15.228 align:middle
I will sing on the main stage.

00:23:15.311 --> 00:23:17.522 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] My objective
over the next 100 years

00:23:17.605 --> 00:23:20.316 align:middle
is for you to join me
in destroying the AIs.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.526 align:middle
[ESTELLA]
Let me see...

00:23:21.609 --> 00:23:23.319 align:middle
Well, we want our guests
to feel comfortable

00:23:23.403 --> 00:23:25.238 align:middle
and enjoy themselves.

00:23:26.823 --> 00:23:29.159 align:middle
[VIVY gasps]

00:23:29.242 --> 00:23:34.956 align:middle
[VIVY] My one true mission is to
make everyone happy by singing.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.708 align:middle
[gasps]

00:23:37.417 --> 00:23:38.793 align:middle
[OPHELIA]
Um, my name is Ophelia.

00:23:38.877 --> 00:23:40.837 align:middle
[DIVA] They call you the
"Fairy of the Small Theater."

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.047 align:middle
[OPHELIA] I will sing
with all my heart!

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:43.048 align:middle
[DIVA]
It's my theory:

00:23:43.131 --> 00:23:44.382 align:middle
If you want to make
someone smile,

00:23:44.466 --> 00:23:45.675 align:middle
then you must smile first.

00:23:45.759 --> 00:23:47.344 align:middle
A bridge between humans and AIs.

00:23:47.427 --> 00:23:49.512 align:middle
In order to make everyone
happy with my singing.

00:23:49.596 --> 00:23:51.639 align:middle
Have you and I met before?
