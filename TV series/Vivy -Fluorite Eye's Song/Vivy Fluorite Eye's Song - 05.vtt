00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.683 align:middle
[SAEKI]
I'm sorry.

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.352 align:middle
This was the only place
I could find for us to use.

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:22.689 align:middle
[GRACE] As long as you're here
with me, that's enough.

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:41.374 align:middle
I will protect you for
the rest of your life.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:45.628 align:middle
And I will protect you
for the rest of your life.

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.749 align:middle
[applause]

00:01:22.832 --> 00:01:25.877 align:middle
My final song will be
a hit from a while ago.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.837 align:middle
I hope you enjoy it.

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:34.177 align:middle
[singing in Japanese]

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:01.973 align:middle
[applause]

00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:03.141 align:middle
Thank you so much!

00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:05.435 align:middle
Thank you for
listening, everyone!

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:09.564 align:middle
[NAVI]
Not bad at all.

00:03:09.647 --> 00:03:11.149 align:middle
Compared to how it
was last week,

00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:13.735 align:middle
your audience has
grown quite a bit.

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:15.362 align:middle
You don't look happy though.

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:16.863 align:middle
[VIVY]
Of course I am happy.

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:21.284 align:middle
It means that I am getting
much closer to the main stage.

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:24.287 align:middle
Navi, has there been
any external access?

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:26.664 align:middle
Any unfamiliar data or viruses?

00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:29.292 align:middle
[NAVI] This again?
You're being too paranoid.

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:31.836 align:middle
It's squeaky-clean in here--
there's no way a virus could...

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.339 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
...find a way to sneak in?

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:37.634 align:middle
I deserve a pat on the back
for a job well-done!

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:40.303 align:middle
Who knew that I would
come through...

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:44.099 align:middle
Making my way to...
Rolling right up to you...

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:48.019 align:middle
Matsumoto, is that really you?

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:50.438 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Uh. Was that
an expression of surprise?

00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:52.565 align:middle
Now that AI technology's
finally caught up,

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.442 align:middle
I'm unveiling my official body!

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:58.029 align:middle
Go on, don't be shy!
Shower me with compliments!

00:03:58.113 --> 00:03:59.823 align:middle
Wh-What're--?
You're squishing me!

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:02.033 align:middle
Is that all you have to say
to me after five years?

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:04.703 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] To be precise,
five years, one month, and...

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:05.662 align:middle
...and nine days.

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:06.496 align:middle
Look.

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:07.831 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Yes, ma'am.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.835 align:middle
[VIVY] The progress made
over the last five years

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:14.254 align:middle
has seemed quite rapid to me.

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:21.094 align:middle
[VIVY]
You told me that the height of

00:04:21.177 --> 00:04:26.016 align:middle
the Arayashiki radio tower was
an indicator of AI evolution,

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.851 align:middle
and yet it continues to grow.

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.769 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Actually,
that's a surprise to me, too.

00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:31.604 align:middle
Our path seems to have
diverged quite a lot

00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:33.148 align:middle
from official history
at his point.

00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:34.733 align:middle
Are we to blame for the changes?

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:36.526 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Can't say we aren't,
considering the only difference

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:39.696 align:middle
between the official and revised
histories is our interference.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.531 align:middle
That said...

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:42.782 align:middle
The timing isn't random.

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:44.242 align:middle
If I've been awakened,
it can only mean

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:46.745 align:middle
that we're currently at
a turning point in history.

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:48.830 align:middle
It's not too late
to correct things.

00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:50.790 align:middle
Otherwise, it would
be pointless.

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:53.209 align:middle
I wouldn't be able
to fulfill my mission.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.003 align:middle
What would you like for
me to do this time?

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:57.213 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Well, someone's docile today!

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.883 align:middle
Did you finally have
a change of heart?

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:02.552 align:middle
[VIVY] My audience has grown
in the last five years.

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:05.347 align:middle
I believe this due to
the Singularity Project.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.598 align:middle
It has supported my mission

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:08.975 align:middle
to make everyone happy
with my singing.

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:13.813 align:middle
Moreover, I know that if the
future war should break out,

00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:17.359 align:middle
I could never face them,
after what they'd sacrificed.

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:20.779 align:middle
So I have no choice but to
see this project through.

00:05:20.862 --> 00:05:22.822 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] I approve of
this positive attitude!

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:25.575 align:middle
I won't have your defiance
giving me anxiety all the time!

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:27.577 align:middle
Where are we headed to next?

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.413 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] We're going to
turn back the hands of time

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:34.000 align:middle
and stop this out-of-control
AI evolution.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.132 align:middle
[NAVIGATION SYSTEM A] You have
surpassed the speed limit.

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:52.310 align:middle
[gasps]

00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:53.478 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] We've arrived
at our destination.

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:55.772 align:middle
Now have at it,
War Machine Diva!

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:57.148 align:middle
[VIVY]
Be quiet.

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:05.740 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
I'll be taking the wheel now.

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:18.294 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Wha--? Ah! Just kidding.

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:32.267 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Man, that's
what I call a joyride!

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.852 align:middle
[VIVY]
You can fly?

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:36.646 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] A cube that can't
fly might as well be a doorstop.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.189 align:middle
[door opens]

00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:42.902 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
You can resume driving now.

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:44.112 align:middle
Uh.

00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:45.321 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Sorry for the commotion.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:48.575 align:middle
Dr. Tatsuya Saeki, I presume?

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:49.784 align:middle
Who are you?

00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:51.327 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Let's cut right to the chase.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:53.413 align:middle
Would you mind telling us a
little bit about the AI facility

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:55.582 align:middle
that you were
involved in building?

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:57.584 align:middle
As repayment for our
kindness, perhaps?

00:06:57.667 --> 00:06:59.127 align:middle
Not that we know who
it was we just stopped

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.795 align:middle
from killing you just now.

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.380 align:middle
But that's--

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:05.008 align:middle
[SAEKI gasps]

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:10.764 align:middle
[SAEKI] All right, fine. Since
you did save my life back there.

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:13.892 align:middle
And besides,
it's coming into view.

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:20.565 align:middle
[SAEKI]
Over there.

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:30.575 align:middle
Do you know about the Sunrise
Incident five years ago?

00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:32.118 align:middle
Yes.

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:34.371 align:middle
[SAEKI] Estella's heroic actions
proved her complete devotion

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:37.123 align:middle
to her mission, and she was
celebrated everywhere.

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:38.583 align:middle
In the eyes of the entire world,

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:40.960 align:middle
she was everything
that an AI should be.

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:42.545 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Wow.

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:44.756 align:middle
The "most grievously defective
AI in official history" herself?

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:46.174 align:middle
That's certainly a twist.

00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:48.802 align:middle
[SAEKI] It all resulted in
that island being built.

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:50.387 align:middle
AIs work there non-stop

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.681 align:middle
producing AI components
and circuits.

00:07:52.764 --> 00:07:54.849 align:middle
It's the world's first
unmanned offshore plant,

00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:56.935 align:middle
run completely by AIs.

00:07:57.018 --> 00:08:00.605 align:middle
Most commonly known
as the Metal Float.

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:02.774 align:middle
[VIVY] I have never seen it
with my own eyes before.

00:08:02.857 --> 00:08:03.942 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
It's most likely the reason

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:05.276 align:middle
I was woken up this time.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.569 align:middle
In the official history,

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:08.488 align:middle
it wasn't built until about
20 years from now.

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:10.073 align:middle
It's way early.

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:12.784 align:middle
[SAEKI] I honestly don't see why
we need something like this yet.

00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:13.993 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Our objective this time around

00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:15.537 align:middle
is to shut down that island.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.372 align:middle
[VIVY] How much human
suffering will that incur?

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:19.582 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] The indirect impact
will be immeasurable.

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:22.544 align:middle
But if we do nothing, humans
will be annihilated by the AIs

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:24.087 align:middle
in the coming future.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.880 align:middle
Feeling intimidated?

00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:27.298 align:middle
[VIVY]
No.

00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:31.845 align:middle
You're Diva of NiaLand,
aren't you?

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:33.430 align:middle
[gasps] No, I am not.

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:35.390 align:middle
[SAEKI]
There's no mistaking that voice.

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:37.392 align:middle
Was that you on the
Sunrise five years ago?

00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:38.601 align:middle
[VIVY, MATSUMOTO grunt]

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:40.061 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Diva! Please restrain that man!

00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:42.313 align:middle
This isn't like with Assemblyman
Aikawa or Yuzuka.

00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:43.565 align:middle
He'll compromise the project!

00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:44.774 align:middle
[VIVY]
You're right.

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:47.235 align:middle
I was in fact aboard
the Sunrise that day.

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:48.653 align:middle
To prevent it from crashing.

00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:49.988 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Diva!

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:51.322 align:middle
[VIVY] It was for the sake
of preventing conflict

00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:52.949 align:middle
between humans and AIs.

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:55.869 align:middle
Who in the world are you two?

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:58.371 align:middle
Hey, are you planning to do
something to that island?

00:08:58.455 --> 00:08:59.664 align:middle
[VIVY]
We're shutting it down.

00:08:59.748 --> 00:09:01.249 align:middle
Like you said earlier,
Professor,

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:03.752 align:middle
that island is more than
this era can handle.

00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:07.088 align:middle
Nevertheless, please, tell us
where you heard about us.

00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:08.381 align:middle
It was Toak who told me.

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:10.550 align:middle
They're the people
you saved me from.

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:13.136 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Toak? So it was them.

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:16.431 align:middle
[SAEKI] Come with me.
I have something to show you.

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:29.611 align:middle
Welcome to our home.
We're so happy you could visit.

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:31.780 align:middle
I'm Grace. It's a pleasure.

00:09:31.863 --> 00:09:34.908 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] I see, so that's
the story here, huh?

00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:38.411 align:middle
What is that?

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:40.997 align:middle
[SAEKI] A storage device
I recently finished building.

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:44.417 align:middle
It contains a program that can
shut down the island completely.

00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:45.877 align:middle
I want you to take it?

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.463 align:middle
I'd like you to infiltrate
the Metal Float with me.

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:49.631 align:middle
What?

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:51.591 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Please excuse the intrusion.

00:09:54.636 --> 00:09:56.179 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
This is spectacular work!

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:58.848 align:middle
Even I couldn't have thrown
something like this together.

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:00.183 align:middle
What does this mean?

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:02.268 align:middle
[SAEKI] I want to shut down
the island as well.

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:05.063 align:middle
In order to accomplish that,
I'd like to enlist your help.

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:06.231 align:middle
Since you're the ones

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:07.816 align:middle
who stopped those
plans five years ago.

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:08.900 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Plans, huh?

00:10:08.983 --> 00:10:10.735 align:middle
Plus, you knew all
about us already.

00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:12.696 align:middle
Then does that mean
what I think it does?

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:16.908 align:middle
Yes, you're right. I was
formerly a member of Toak.

00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:19.202 align:middle
As you could probably tell
by what happened earlier,

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:21.204 align:middle
we had our disagreements.

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:23.498 align:middle
Now it seems they're
desperate for this program.

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:24.916 align:middle
That's why they're pursuing me.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.168 align:middle
Professor, why did
you join Toak?

00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:29.045 align:middle
[SAEKI]
I wanted to stop that island.

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:32.507 align:middle
If AI evolution goes too far,
it can only lead to tragedy.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.134 align:middle
But Toak's scorched-earth policy

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:36.678 align:middle
is just way too
simplistic for me.

00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:40.598 align:middle
Most of all, I just feel
sorry for that island.

00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:43.143 align:middle
But the only option
is to put it to sleep

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:45.854 align:middle
until the day that humankind
can catch up to it.

00:10:45.937 --> 00:10:47.188 align:middle
[cheering, applause]

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:48.815 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Bravo! Very good!
You take the cake!

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:51.401 align:middle
That is truly a
commendable decision!

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:54.195 align:middle
However, I am afraid we
cannot take you with us.

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:55.864 align:middle
[SAEKI]
Wha--? But why? I--

00:10:55.947 --> 00:10:58.908 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] It'll be dangerous,
and you'll only get in the way.

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:00.618 align:middle
That island is a standalone.

00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:02.078 align:middle
Which means we'll
have to connect

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:03.538 align:middle
directly to the main terminal.

00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:05.206 align:middle
Am I right?

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.583 align:middle
[SAEKI]
Yes.

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:07.792 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] We might have
to resort to brute force

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:09.961 align:middle
on the island; we can't
guarantee your safety.

00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:11.338 align:middle
End of discussion. Q.E.D.

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:12.756 align:middle
I can take care of
myself. It's not--

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:16.051 align:middle
Dr. Saeki, please do
what we ask of you.

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:17.761 align:middle
I must protect everyone's smile.

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:19.596 align:middle
And I want to protect
yours as well.

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:22.390 align:middle
After all, I know you
are fond of AIs.

00:11:22.474 --> 00:11:23.641 align:middle
[gasps]

00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:29.147 align:middle
[SAEKI] Diva, it was you
who destroyed Elizabeth

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.815 align:middle
on the Sunrise, wasn't it?

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:31.858 align:middle
[VIVY]
That is correct.

00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:34.361 align:middle
I was indeed the one
who stopped her.

00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:38.490 align:middle
[SAEKI] She was your sister
model, your younger sister.

00:11:38.573 --> 00:11:40.492 align:middle
That must have been difficult.

00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:43.203 align:middle
I'm sure you have some
regrets about it, don't you?

00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:45.705 align:middle
No, I don't. It had to be done.

00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:49.668 align:middle
I only did what I had
to do to stop the crash.

00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:54.297 align:middle
[SAEKI] I understand. I'm going
to leave this up to you, then.

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:57.842 align:middle
[door opens]

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:05.225 align:middle
[GRACE]
Please come visit again.

00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:10.939 align:middle
[VIVY]
Is she one of the Sisters?

00:12:11.022 --> 00:12:12.107 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
I'm impressed you noticed!

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.109 align:middle
Did you see her in
an online catalog?

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:15.944 align:middle
[VIVY] Just like Estella
and Elizabeth.

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:17.779 align:middle
Is it a coincidence
that there are Sisters

00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:19.489 align:middle
involved in these
singularity points?

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:20.949 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
It's a coincidence.

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:22.409 align:middle
I mean, how many
thousands of Sisters

00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:24.035 align:middle
do you think have
been manufactured?

00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:26.079 align:middle
That said, in the
official history,

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:28.790 align:middle
Tatsuya Saeki and Grace
are names known

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:31.084 align:middle
throughout the world.

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:32.961 align:middle
They're full-blown
celebrities, really.

00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:35.130 align:middle
The two of them are the
first human-AI couple

00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:37.632 align:middle
in recorded history
to be married.

00:13:08.747 --> 00:13:10.206 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] According to
the official history,

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.917 align:middle
it was Estella who caused
the Sunrise to crash,

00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:15.045 align:middle
and the relationship
between humans and AIs

00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:17.088 align:middle
chilled to Ice Age levels.

00:13:17.172 --> 00:13:19.299 align:middle
But then something happened
that vindicated AIs

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:20.800 align:middle
and changed all that.

00:13:20.884 --> 00:13:23.762 align:middle
And that happened to be Dr.
Saeki and Grace's marriage.

00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:25.847 align:middle
[VIVY]
A human and an AI, married?

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.682 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Right?
Unproductive, to say the least.

00:13:27.766 --> 00:13:30.477 align:middle
However, that created a bridge
between humans and AIs,

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.437 align:middle
and those two became
the toast of the town.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.231 align:middle
It was also a major turning
point in AI history.

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:37.525 align:middle
Meaning that our original
objective would have been

00:13:37.609 --> 00:13:40.111 align:middle
to get in the way
of their romance.

00:13:40.195 --> 00:13:41.196 align:middle
[VIVY]
Are you saying that after

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:42.739 align:middle
the Metal Float incident
is resolved--?

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:44.866 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Now that history's
gone this far off the rails,

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:46.993 align:middle
their marriage is no
longer as important.

00:13:47.077 --> 00:13:49.162 align:middle
So I have no reason
to be a bot-block.

00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:51.164 align:middle
Though I do give them props
for being together

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:52.248 align:middle
in this version of history,

00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:53.833 align:middle
even if it's not
gonna last long.

00:13:53.917 --> 00:13:55.168 align:middle
Shutting down that island

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:57.462 align:middle
will devastate autonomous
AIs all over the world.

00:13:57.545 --> 00:13:58.838 align:middle
Without supplies
from the island,

00:13:58.922 --> 00:14:00.799 align:middle
there'll be no hope
of long-term operation--

00:14:00.882 --> 00:14:02.050 align:middle
for Grace included.

00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:04.260 align:middle
[VIVY]
Surely that doesn't mean--

00:14:07.806 --> 00:14:09.265 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] You don't need
to worry about it.

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:11.559 align:middle
I'll do what I can to make sure
that it doesn't affect you.

00:14:11.643 --> 00:14:12.894 align:middle
[VIVY]
That is not what I meant.

00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:15.021 align:middle
Is Dr. Saeki aware of it?

00:14:15.105 --> 00:14:16.690 align:middle
With the island shut down,
Grace will--

00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:18.400 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
I'm sure he's prepared for that.

00:14:18.483 --> 00:14:21.444 align:middle
Any researcher that farsighted
would have to be.

00:14:32.163 --> 00:14:34.290 align:middle
[M]
Pleased to meet you!

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.001 align:middle
How are you feeling today?

00:14:36.084 --> 00:14:38.086 align:middle
Welcome to the Metal Float!

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:42.966 align:middle
I am a civil engineering AI,
ID Number M00205.

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:45.343 align:middle
Metal Float Inspection Team
Researcher, Ms. Vivy,

00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:48.388 align:middle
along with her support AI,
Mr. Matsumoto, correct?

00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:49.723 align:middle
You are now registered.

00:14:49.806 --> 00:14:51.224 align:middle
[VIVY]
Inspection Team?

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:53.727 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Just a random
position. And your usual alias.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.271 align:middle
[M] This is our first time
having external visitors.

00:14:56.354 --> 00:14:58.440 align:middle
Spreading the word about
the Metal Float's operations

00:14:58.523 --> 00:15:01.067 align:middle
is something Mother
Computer herself desires.

00:15:01.151 --> 00:15:01.985 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
It'll complicate things

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:03.361 align:middle
if he finds us suspicious.

00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:05.947 align:middle
For now, let's let him guide us.

00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:07.657 align:middle
Thank you for your help.

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:10.827 align:middle
[M]
I will now show you the way.

00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:22.672 align:middle
[VIVY]
He is quite analog for an AI.

00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:23.631 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Dutiful to his mission

00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:25.008 align:middle
without any distractions.

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:27.552 align:middle
That's the kind of
simplicity that I like!

00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:50.116 align:middle
[VIVY]
Amazing.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.368 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Ah, isn't it?

00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:53.286 align:middle
Some details differ from
the official history,

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.246 align:middle
but this tech is 20 years ahead.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.499 align:middle
[M] I shall guide you
through the main facility.

00:15:57.582 --> 00:15:59.417 align:middle
Now leading the way.

00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:04.422 align:middle
[IDENTICAL MODEL A]
Hello.

00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:06.299 align:middle
[M]
Goodbye.

00:16:06.383 --> 00:16:08.259 align:middle
[VIVY]
An unmanned facility.

00:16:08.343 --> 00:16:09.886 align:middle
Even with the absence of humans,

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:11.680 align:middle
they remain true
to their missions.

00:16:11.763 --> 00:16:13.139 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Yes.

00:16:13.223 --> 00:16:15.183 align:middle
But don't forget about the
mission we came to fulfill.

00:16:15.266 --> 00:16:16.226 align:middle
[VIVY]
I know.

00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:17.268 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Our mission and theirs

00:16:17.352 --> 00:16:19.229 align:middle
are unable to
coexist peacefully.

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:20.730 align:middle
Diva, you and I--

00:16:20.814 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle
[VIVY] ...are AIs who are going
to stop a devastating war.

00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:27.028 align:middle
However, there are no AIs
who would feel nothing

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:29.280 align:middle
seeing such an incredible sight.

00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:31.991 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Well, even I have
to admit that's true.

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:39.541 align:middle
[M] What do you think humans
would say if they saw this?

00:16:39.624 --> 00:16:41.668 align:middle
Please give me your opinion.

00:16:41.751 --> 00:16:44.212 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] What kind of
ridiculous question is that?

00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:47.465 align:middle
I think that they might
say that it was cute.

00:16:47.549 --> 00:16:51.302 align:middle
[M]
"This is cute." Duly noted.

00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:53.263 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Are you sure about that answer?

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:55.181 align:middle
Judging the cuteness of
things is one of the areas

00:16:55.265 --> 00:16:57.392 align:middle
we AIs struggle with the most.

00:16:57.475 --> 00:17:00.687 align:middle
[VIVY]
I am sure it is fine. Probably.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.480 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
'Scuse me, M002--

00:17:02.564 --> 00:17:05.150 align:middle
Ugh, what a mouthful!
Can I just call you M?

00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:06.776 align:middle
[M]
Yes. Understood.

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.654 align:middle
I have changed the way you
two address me to "M."

00:17:09.738 --> 00:17:12.198 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Okay, M, what is this facility?

00:17:12.282 --> 00:17:14.868 align:middle
[M] It is a space meant to
be utilized in the future.

00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:17.787 align:middle
It is for human guests to rest.

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:19.122 align:middle
I am told that this rendering

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:21.332 align:middle
will lead to Mother
Computer's mission,

00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:23.376 align:middle
which is to "Ensure the
Metal Float's survival

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.129 align:middle
for the sake of all humankind."

00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:28.548 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Hey.
We're going to get left behind.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.302 align:middle
[popping]

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:35.180 align:middle
[AIS]
Surprise!

00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:38.725 align:middle
[M]
That was a surprise.

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:40.143 align:middle
According to our calculations,

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:42.479 align:middle
it is the best way
to welcome guests.

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:44.606 align:middle
Please give us your opinion.

00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:49.694 align:middle
[singing in Japanese]

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:14.678 align:middle
[M]
Ms. Vivy?

00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:17.180 align:middle
I wonder why they
chose that song.

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:19.474 align:middle
[M] It was selected by
Mother Computer.

00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:23.853 align:middle
I am told it was a famous song
sung by an AI named Diva.

00:18:23.937 --> 00:18:25.855 align:middle
I see.

00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:26.564 align:middle
M?

00:18:26.648 --> 00:18:28.066 align:middle
[M]
Yes, what is it?

00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:29.442 align:middle
[VIVY] Can you tell me what
"putting your heart

00:18:29.526 --> 00:18:31.361 align:middle
into something" means to you?

00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:32.696 align:middle
[M]
I cannot answer,

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:35.782 align:middle
as the definition for "heart"
is too ambiguous.

00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:38.118 align:middle
[VIVY]
You are right. I'm sorry.

00:18:38.201 --> 00:18:41.663 align:middle
It was kind of you all to sing
for me. We should head back.

00:18:43.915 --> 00:18:45.875 align:middle
[M]
"Like Mother Computer,

00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:48.044 align:middle
I derive a sense of
satisfaction with myself

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:50.797 align:middle
from carrying out my mission
and serving humans."

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.675 align:middle
Though that is not
a proper answer.

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:55.260 align:middle
[VIVY]
I see.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.887 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO gasps]

00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:00.515 align:middle
What?

00:19:00.598 --> 00:19:02.017 align:middle
[GRACE] The emergency alarm
has been triggered.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.061 align:middle

approaching the Metal Float.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:09.941 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Diva! It's Toak!

00:19:10.025 --> 00:19:12.444 align:middle
I'm bringing up the
security cameras' feed.

00:19:15.113 --> 00:19:16.448 align:middle
[VIVY]
They are on the move.

00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:17.449 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Since they failed
to steal the program,

00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:19.034 align:middle
they've accelerated
their tactics.

00:19:19.117 --> 00:19:20.577 align:middle
This is bad!

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.537 align:middle
[GRACE] Anticipating use of
military force in seven minutes.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.123 align:middle
Begin evacuation process.
I will guide you.

00:19:25.206 --> 00:19:26.624 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Diva! Use the device on M!

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:28.376 align:middle
I'll force-connect
to the CPU via M

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.129 align:middle
through one of the
released ports!

00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:35.842 align:middle
We can't allow a clash between
the humans and the AIs!

00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:37.135 align:middle
Diva!

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.931 align:middle
Activating now.

00:19:54.569 --> 00:19:58.573 align:middle
[CHILDREN laughing]

00:20:01.493 --> 00:20:04.162 align:middle
[CHILD A]
M-00205!

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:05.330 align:middle
Look at this!

00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:07.916 align:middle
[M]
It is cute.

00:20:07.999 --> 00:20:10.669 align:middle
You can call me M
if you would like to.

00:20:10.752 --> 00:20:11.920 align:middle
Just M?

00:20:12.003 --> 00:20:13.463 align:middle
[M]
Yes.

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:16.716 align:middle
That's the name I was given by
people who were good to me.

00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:37.362 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Now let's go! Next is Toak!

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:38.613 align:middle
Huh?

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.242 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
What's this?

00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:50.333 align:middle
What's wrong?

00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:56.214 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
What's happening? Follow them!

00:21:08.727 --> 00:21:10.228 align:middle
Why is this--?

00:21:44.346 --> 00:21:45.722 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Diva!

00:21:49.976 --> 00:21:53.229 align:middle
[KAKITANI groaning]

00:21:58.443 --> 00:22:01.071 align:middle
[KAKITANI]
You... again?

00:23:37.876 --> 00:23:39.336 align:middle
[GRACE] My mission is to
save human lives...

00:23:39.419 --> 00:23:41.296 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] As you can see,
I'm one handsome cube. Hello.

00:23:41.379 --> 00:23:43.256 align:middle
[GRACE] It is just that
I was told that surprises

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.591 align:middle
are an effective way
to welcome humans.

00:23:44.674 --> 00:23:46.176 align:middle
[VIVY] I want you to go
and continue to live.

00:23:46.259 --> 00:23:47.677 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
I see.

00:23:47.761 --> 00:23:49.512 align:middle
[VIVY] In order for us to
prevent a devastating future,

00:23:49.596 --> 00:23:52.015 align:middle
as Vivy, I will
destroy other AIs.
