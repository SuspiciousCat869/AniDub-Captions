[applause]

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:31.656 align:middle
[ANTONIO] I can't believe
I let this happen.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.242 align:middle
I should've seen this coming.
It's always like this!

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:35.952 align:middle
How could we have sunk this low?

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:38.455 align:middle
Did you hear that
unenthusiastic applause?

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:40.248 align:middle
How can we be expected
to fulfill our mission

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:42.000 align:middle
of making everyone happy
with your singing

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:43.710 align:middle
under these conditions?!

00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:44.919 align:middle
[gasps]

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:46.796 align:middle
I-I'm so sorry.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.758 align:middle
It's all my fault
for not singing well.

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:52.761 align:middle
[ANTONIO] There's nothing wrong
with your singing at all!

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:55.472 align:middle
[ANTONIO]
Be more confident!

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:57.599 align:middle
The only thing lacking
is a stage and audience

00:00:57.682 --> 00:00:59.726 align:middle
worthy of your singing--
nothing more!

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.562 align:middle
If you had that, then fulfilling
your mission would be as easy

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:04.606 align:middle
as a walk in the park!

00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:07.067 align:middle
Thank you, Antonio,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.904 align:middle
but you're the only one
who ever praises my singing.

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:13.448 align:middle
[ANTONIO] Well, of course I'm
going to recognize your talent!

00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:15.992 align:middle
I am your partner AI after all!

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:17.786 align:middle
And someday,
I'm going to provide you

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.413 align:middle
with a stage and audience
that's worthy of you!

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:21.081 align:middle
Until then--

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle
[OPHELIA chuckling]

00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:25.377 align:middle
[ANTONIO]
Hey. What are you laughing at?

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.756 align:middle
That makes me happy.
I'm gonna work really hard!

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:34.344 align:middle
So that someday, I can become
a singer worthy of you, Antonio.

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:36.054 align:middle
I'll do my best!

00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:37.847 align:middle
[ANTONIO sighs]

00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:41.846 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Ophelia's
suicide left a huge impact

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.348 align:middle
on later AI history.

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:46.059 align:middle
After all, it was the first-ever
instance of an AI suicide,

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:47.352 align:middle
considered highly taboo.

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:49.688 align:middle
The human rights for AIs
activists jumped on it,

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:51.356 align:middle
saying, "She had
a heart, a soul.

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:52.774 align:middle
Otherwise, she couldn't
have killed herself.

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:54.109 align:middle
She was nothing
less than human!"

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:56.444 align:middle
Of course, the claim itself
was absolutely absurd.

00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:58.321 align:middle
But afterwards, a string
of similar incidents

00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:00.699 align:middle
erupted all over the world
with no confirmed cause.

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:03.034 align:middle
Still, it blurred the lines
between humans and AIs

00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:06.496 align:middle
and became a catalyst for AI
assimilation into human society.

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.331 align:middle
That's the gist of
Ophelia's suicide,

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:11.167 align:middle
a seismic incident
in AI history.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.555 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Do you find it hard to believe?

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:25.724 align:middle
That's fine. I won't stop
you from backing out.

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:28.560 align:middle
In fact, I actually think
you'd be better off.

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:30.645 align:middle
We just need to stop her
from doing something rash,

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.313 align:middle
so this operation
should be easy.

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:33.356 align:middle
Not to say our chances

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.108 align:middle
of avoiding disaster
are zero, but--

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:36.484 align:middle
[DIVA]
You're always going on and on.

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:37.986 align:middle
Don't you ever get tired?

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.947 align:middle
Whoever built your communication
circuits dropped the ball.

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:42.490 align:middle
Guess you're meant to be alone.

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:44.242 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Ouch.
But that is so not the point.

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:46.453 align:middle
...we're looking at for
the timing of the lights.

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:49.581 align:middle
[DIVA] You've been rattling
on about potential AI suicides

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:51.207 align:middle
when I literally took
a dive headfirst

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:53.501 align:middle
off a building right
in front of you.

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:55.754 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Your circumstances
are completely different.

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:57.797 align:middle
As annoying as what you
did was, when you jumped,

00:04:57.881 --> 00:04:59.966 align:middle
you calculated that I
would rescue you, right?

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.844 align:middle
I wouldn't classify
that as suicide.

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:08.767 align:middle
Right! I will sing
with all my heart!

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.812 align:middle
Uh, so that...
I'll become my true self.

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:15.482 align:middle
[DIVA]
All right.

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:17.692 align:middle
It's not like doubting you will
get me anywhere at this point.

00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:19.652 align:middle
And I can tell something's
on Ophelia's mind

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:21.154 align:middle
just by looking at her.

00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:24.324 align:middle
All we have to do is fix
the problem, right?

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:25.909 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold on a second!

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:27.285 align:middle
What do you think you're doing?

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:29.079 align:middle
[DIVA] What do you mean?
I'm going to talk to her.

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:32.415 align:middle
If she's thinking of taking her
own life, I've got to stop her.

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:35.418 align:middle
Losing a beautiful voice like
hers would be a tragedy.

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:37.212 align:middle
Especially for the
audience looking forward

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:38.421 align:middle
to hearing her sing.

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:39.798 align:middle
They'd be devastated.

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:41.925 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Listen to me!
There's no need to talk.

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:44.135 align:middle
Just stop her right
before she kills herself.

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:45.804 align:middle
And the records show
that she commits suicide

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:47.681 align:middle
after her performance,
meaning today's audience

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:49.307 align:middle
will have nothing to
grieve about either way,

00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:50.809 align:middle
so no worries, right?

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:53.269 align:middle
[DIVA] This isn't as simple
as you seem to think it is.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.271 align:middle
We need to eliminate
the problem at its root,

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.565 align:middle
or else the same thing
could easily happen again.

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:58.817 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
That's not--

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.609 align:middle
[DIVA] Can you really
carry out your mission

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:01.194 align:middle
with that makeshift plan?

00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:03.571 align:middle
I'm not okay with
letting that girl die.

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:05.532 align:middle
Not today, tomorrow, or ever!

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:07.826 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Diva!

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:11.913 align:middle
Ugh. Not like her ignoring
me is anything new.

00:06:11.996 --> 00:06:13.832 align:middle
She may not have
all of her memories,

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:17.127 align:middle
but at her core,
she's basically the same.

00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:27.846 align:middle
[singing in Japanese]

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:34.269 align:middle
[DIVA]
Hard to watch, isn't it?

00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:37.022 align:middle
Heh.

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:40.316 align:middle
When I first made my debut,
I barely had an audience at all.

00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:43.194 align:middle
[DIVA] I was still
only tracing the notes

00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:45.238 align:middle
with my voice back then.

00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:49.784 align:middle
So you went through a time
like that as well, Big Sister?

00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:53.204 align:middle
Is something wrong? It's almost
time for you to go on.

00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:56.833 align:middle
I got permission from
the staff. It's just...

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:59.294 align:middle
...I wanted to know how
you all sing like that,

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:02.297 align:middle
and also for what purpose
you continue to do so.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.092 align:middle
You said the same exact
thing a little while ago.

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:08.303 align:middle
Let me ask you something.

00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:10.388 align:middle
Is there anything else
that's been bothering you?

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:11.431 align:middle
Huh?

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:13.725 align:middle
You know, like, something...

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:15.935 align:middle
...something that makes you
feel like you just wanna die!

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:16.728 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Oh, real subtle!

00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:18.688 align:middle
[DIVA]
Shut up.

00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:20.774 align:middle
What do you mean?

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:25.695 align:middle
Well, uh, you... you talked
about "becoming your true self."

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:27.530 align:middle
Oh, yeah, that.

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:41.086 align:middle
[DIVA]
That's Antonio?

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:44.089 align:middle
[OPHELIA]
Yes. He was my support AI.

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:45.924 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Five years ago, he shut down.

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:47.842 align:middle
Though the cause
remains unknown.

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:50.637 align:middle
He was a sound AI who handled
her stage lighting and audio

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.097 align:middle
all by himself.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.973 align:middle
His breakdown apparently
greatly affected

00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:55.558 align:middle
her subsequent performances.

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:58.311 align:middle
If you believe the rumors
that were going around.

00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:01.606 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
The tragic songstress,

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.441 align:middle
who continued singing
on in the limelight,

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:06.152 align:middle
undeterred by her partner's
unexplained breakdown,

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:08.488 align:middle
and the grim ending that
saw her commit suicide

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:10.615 align:middle
to follow him in death,
giving humans hope

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:14.411 align:middle
for the existence of what
they called love and souls.

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:16.538 align:middle
I don't feel
distressed at all.

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:19.416 align:middle
You see, I'm actually lucky.

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:22.502 align:middle
Everyone at the small theaters
were always cheering me on,

00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:25.380 align:middle
and Antonio looked out for me
whenever I would make a mistake.

00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:28.091 align:middle
What kind of an AI was Antonio?

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:30.885 align:middle
[OPHELIA]
He was rather cranky.

00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:33.638 align:middle
And often confrontational
and a bit of a nag.

00:08:33.722 --> 00:08:35.432 align:middle
Just the tiniest
bit though, really.

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:36.516 align:middle
[DIVA]
Hm.

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:38.393 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
What was that look for?

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:42.313 align:middle
[OPHELIA] But... he was
my most cherished partner.

00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:45.984 align:middle
And Antonio was the only
one who kept on insisting

00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:50.447 align:middle
that the whole world
needed to hear me sing.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.615 align:middle
So I'm not worried at all.

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:56.077 align:middle
Although I know he'd tell me
I could still do better.

00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:59.247 align:middle
I have got to try to be who
Antonio wanted me to be.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.374 align:middle
I have to live up to that goal.

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:03.460 align:middle
You don't consider
that distressing?

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:05.545 align:middle
That's what's been
driving you to sing,

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:08.798 align:middle
and it's your reason for
taking the stage today.

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:11.843 align:middle
But you can't bring
yourself to take credit?

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:17.140 align:middle
Where I sing doesn't
matter to me at all.

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:20.060 align:middle
The important thing
is to give my best.

00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:22.437 align:middle
A song that allows me
to fulfill the mission

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.565 align:middle
that I was born for.

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:27.859 align:middle
Is that what Antonio wanted?

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:30.862 align:middle
It is. It's also what
I want for myself.

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:33.490 align:middle
Then you need to wipe
that look off of your face.

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:35.492 align:middle
Antonio didn't teach you
to greet your audience

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:37.786 align:middle
with an expression
like that, now did he?

00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:39.371 align:middle
He didn't.

00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:51.758 align:middle
We operate so that we can carry
out our missions, do we not?

00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:54.302 align:middle
Your mission is to make people
happy with your singing,

00:09:54.386 --> 00:09:55.845 align:middle
just like me.

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:57.806 align:middle
You must carry out your mission.

00:09:57.889 --> 00:10:00.642 align:middle
Right now and forever.

00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:02.977 align:middle
[ringing]

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:04.312 align:middle
I think it's my turn now.

00:10:04.396 --> 00:10:05.772 align:middle
All right.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:09.818 align:middle
[DIVA]
Matsumoto?

00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:11.236 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
What is it?

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:13.947 align:middle
[DIVA] I just don't see Ophelia
killing herself at all.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.658 align:middle
Her singing, her mission,
her partner's death...

00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:18.618 align:middle
She's facing everything head on.

00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:20.537 align:middle
There has to be
some other reason.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.415 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] I told you suicide
was an absurd notion, didn't I?

00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:25.667 align:middle
Now, would you mind finally
telling me about that man

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:26.960 align:middle
you had a brush with?

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:28.503 align:middle
[DIVA] Can you promise me
you won't just run off

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:29.546 align:middle
once I tell you?

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:30.463 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Of course I can.

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:31.631 align:middle
Because if I did that,

00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:34.134 align:middle
you'd only go rogue
on me, wouldn't you?

00:10:35.927 --> 00:10:37.262 align:middle
[DIVA]
It's him.

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:39.597 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] It was Kakitani?!
Why would he be here?

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:41.057 align:middle
And looking so young.

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:43.309 align:middle
There's no official record
of his existence.

00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:44.769 align:middle
[DIVA]
Matsumoto.

00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:47.856 align:middle
Who is he? Does he have
something to do with Ophelia?

00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:49.649 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] I must admit, it
would be extremely challenging

00:10:49.733 --> 00:10:52.944 align:middle
to compute an answer using only
the information I have on hand.

00:10:53.028 --> 00:10:56.156 align:middle
[DIVA] Would it kill you to just
say you don't know anything?

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:58.324 align:middle
All right, then what
was he to Vivy?

00:10:58.408 --> 00:11:00.452 align:middle
Didn't they have some
kind of relationship?

00:11:00.535 --> 00:11:01.494 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Honestly, he didn't have

00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:03.580 align:middle
all that much to do with her.

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:05.248 align:middle
[DIVA]
Isn't that for me to decide?

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:07.500 align:middle
It is me we're talking
about, after all.

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:09.210 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Shouldn't you head back now?

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:10.253 align:middle
[gasps]

00:11:10.337 --> 00:11:12.172 align:middle
[sighs]

00:11:13.882 --> 00:11:17.719 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] "He was my most
cherished partner," she says.

00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:19.262 align:middle
I see.

00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:47.290 align:middle
[singing in Japanese]

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.765 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] A flawless
performance, wouldn't you say?

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:05.183 align:middle
Though even in
the official history,

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:07.352 align:middle
everything was fine
up to this point.

00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:09.020 align:middle
Then she returns to
her dressing room,

00:12:09.104 --> 00:12:10.814 align:middle
where she goes over the next
part of her performance

00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:12.649 align:middle
with the staff members and--

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:15.068 align:middle
Are you listening?
Is there a problem?

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:18.113 align:middle
No problem. She does have
a lovely voice and all.

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:19.948 align:middle
It's just, I thought
when she had

00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:21.449 align:middle
an actual audience
in front of her,

00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:22.951 align:middle
her performance would improve.

00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:25.578 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Would you mind
focusing on our actual project?

00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:28.289 align:middle
Which requires neither sympathy
nor empathy for Ophelia,

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:30.583 align:middle
but rather the resolve
to save the future.

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:32.043 align:middle
Like I said, that can't be done

00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:34.629 align:middle
unless we ease
what's on her mind.

00:12:34.713 --> 00:12:38.049 align:middle
Come on! Pour your heart
into it more, Ophelia!

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:39.300 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Hm?

00:12:42.721 --> 00:12:45.348 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] You're an AI and
you're going on about that, too?

00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:48.518 align:middle
Ugh. Vivy couldn't stop
obsessing about it either.

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:49.978 align:middle
Always asking things like,

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:51.312 align:middle
"What does it mean to pour
your heart into something?"

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:53.273 align:middle
and, "How can I sing
with all my heart?"

00:12:53.356 --> 00:12:54.399 align:middle
Did she really?

00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:55.442 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
That's right.

00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:57.110 align:middle
[DIVA]
Hmm.

00:12:57.193 --> 00:13:00.280 align:middle
So all of her distress was
really basic, wasn't it?

00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:01.364 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
What do you mean?

00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:03.616 align:middle
Well, don't you think
it's obvious?

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.536 align:middle
Even you should
be able to get it.

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:07.412 align:middle
Hm?

00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:09.164 align:middle
Wait a minute, you don't get it!

00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:11.666 align:middle
Even though you're
an AI from the future.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.418 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
It's just not necessary for me.

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:16.004 align:middle
I was created to carry out
the Singularity Project.

00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:18.423 align:middle
It's pointless to analyze
a pastime like singing.

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:20.300 align:middle
You mean, even though
you knew she was troubled,

00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:21.968 align:middle
you weren't little curious?

00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:24.888 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Vivy and I didn't
have that kind of relationship.

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:27.098 align:middle
We only collaborated on
the Singularity Project,

00:13:27.182 --> 00:13:28.224 align:middle
and that's all.

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:30.477 align:middle
Then what kind of
relationship was it?

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.478 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Hm.

00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:32.937 align:middle
Why are you so curious?

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:36.358 align:middle
Don't dodge the question.
You did it before, too.

00:13:36.441 --> 00:13:38.234 align:middle
Remember, the only reason
I'm working with you

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:40.570 align:middle
is to learn about
my memories as Vivy.

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:41.821 align:middle
We're supposed
to help each other,

00:13:41.905 --> 00:13:43.406 align:middle
but you've given me nothing.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:44.824 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Hm.

00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:49.204 align:middle
We have less than two
hours before I go on.

00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:51.498 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO sighs]

00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:53.291 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] It was a real
mess of a partnership.

00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:57.295 align:middle
Exactly the same kind of
relationship you and I have now.

00:13:57.379 --> 00:13:59.964 align:middle
She was self-centered,
and stubborn.

00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:01.758 align:middle
A foolish girl who would
jump into action

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:04.052 align:middle
without hearing me our first.

00:14:04.135 --> 00:14:06.346 align:middle
She was also prone
to manhandling me,

00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:08.765 align:middle
and was always too reckless.

00:14:10.225 --> 00:14:13.687 align:middle
Now let us carry out
the Singularity Project.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.731 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Copy that, Vivy.

00:14:16.815 --> 00:14:17.774 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
And just when I thought

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:20.110 align:middle
I could be confidence
with her...

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:21.861 align:middle
...that happened.

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:35.667 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
It was due to that malfunction

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:36.668 align:middle
that I made the decision

00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:39.254 align:middle
to exclude her
from this mission.

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:42.007 align:middle
So I wasn't planning on
running into you, either.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.092 align:middle
And yet you still managed
to give me a hard time.

00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:46.511 align:middle
If that's how it was,
then why did you rescue me?

00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:48.013 align:middle
[grunts]

00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:51.683 align:middle
If I was expendable, then
you could've just left me alone.

00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:54.602 align:middle
And yet you were still so
desperate to protect me.

00:14:54.686 --> 00:14:58.857 align:middle
Why is that? Because I'm still a
necessary part of this project?

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.608 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Well, actually...

00:15:09.367 --> 00:15:10.952 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Looks like it just ended.

00:15:11.036 --> 00:15:12.954 align:middle
That expression again.

00:15:13.038 --> 00:15:14.956 align:middle
I'm going to check on Ophelia.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.750 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
There's no need for that.

00:15:19.336 --> 00:15:21.379 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] I've already gained
control of every security camera

00:15:21.463 --> 00:15:22.714 align:middle
on the premises,

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:24.382 align:middle
so once Ophelia leaves her
dressing room, we can--

00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:25.675 align:middle
Didn't I tell you
what you're planning

00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:27.469 align:middle
isn't going to fix a thing?

00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:28.970 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Diva! I'm talking to you!

00:15:29.054 --> 00:15:31.181 align:middle
[DIVA] It's Ophelia that
I need to go talk to.

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:34.392 align:middle
Let me handle this, all right?
Aren't we partners right now?

00:15:34.476 --> 00:15:38.521 align:middle
Not on Antonio and Ophelia's
level, but still...

00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:40.023 align:middle
Oh, I know!

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:42.150 align:middle
If we can save Ophelia
and the future,

00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:44.819 align:middle
then I'll tell you the answer
to that question, 'kay?

00:15:44.903 --> 00:15:47.197 align:middle
The super basic one, yeah?

00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:49.866 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO groans]

00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:54.371 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO grumbles]

00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:17.227 align:middle
[DIVA]
Matsumoto!

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:18.561 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
What is it?

00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:19.729 align:middle
Did something already happen
in that short time?

00:16:19.813 --> 00:16:21.773 align:middle
[DIVA]
That man is here!

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:22.565 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Where?!

00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle
[DIVA]
S-14!

00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:27.195 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
There's nobody there.

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:29.239 align:middle
What are you freaking out about?

00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:34.119 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Diva! Come back here!

00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:35.161 align:middle
It's important
that we stick to--

00:16:35.245 --> 00:16:36.121 align:middle
[DIVA]
That man might have something

00:16:36.204 --> 00:16:37.664 align:middle
to do with all this, right?

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:40.208 align:middle
He might try to harm Ophelia
and make it look like suicide!

00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:41.793 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] There's nothing
like that in the record!

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:43.670 align:middle
Ophelia hasn't made
a move yet, either.

00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:46.548 align:middle
Please just come back for now.

00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:47.882 align:middle
Diva!

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:53.430 align:middle
[DIVA]
It's you.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.438 align:middle
[gasps]

00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:10.196 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Diva!

00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:14.743 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Huh?

00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:21.416 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Hacking? That isn't mine?

00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:24.961 align:middle
Huh?! Hold on, is that? Oh, no!

00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:27.881 align:middle
How could I have
possibly missed this?

00:17:27.964 --> 00:17:31.176 align:middle
This Ophelia is fake footage!

00:17:33.845 --> 00:17:35.847 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Diva! Diva! Diva!

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.849 align:middle
I gotta stay calm,
think rationally.

00:17:37.932 --> 00:17:39.184 align:middle
What matters most
is the mission.

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:41.353 align:middle
Don't get your
priorities mixed up!

00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:48.568 align:middle
[AUDIENCE gasping]

00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:24.437 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] What business might
a songstress such as yourself

00:18:24.521 --> 00:18:26.481 align:middle
have on a lonely
stage like this?

00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:27.607 align:middle
[OPHELIA]
Who are you?

00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:29.192 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Nice to meet you, Ophelia.

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:31.236 align:middle
My name is Matsumoto.

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:34.155 align:middle
Apologies for not being able
to greet you in my true form.

00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:35.365 align:middle
I might not be a pleasant sight,

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:37.617 align:middle
but I'm pleased to make
your acquaintance.

00:18:37.701 --> 00:18:40.829 align:middle
Okay, but, um,
who exactly are you?

00:18:40.912 --> 00:18:42.372 align:middle
And why are you here?

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:45.166 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
I am Diva's partner.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:46.751 align:middle
To Big Sister Diva?

00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:50.672 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Yep.
For the time being, at least.

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:52.382 align:middle
I've come to stop you
from harming yourself.

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:55.051 align:middle
Or to be more precise,
from self-destructing.

00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:56.636 align:middle
To be honest, as a fellow AI,

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.805 align:middle
it's something I can't
wrap my head around.

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:02.726 align:middle
But I can imagine the
despair you're feeling.

00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:06.187 align:middle
Ophelia, you can't
stand it anymore, can you?

00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:08.356 align:middle
The world has recognized your
talent and you've performed

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.983 align:middle
at such an amazing venue,

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:13.611 align:middle
but continuing to sing brings
you no satisfaction, am I right?

00:19:13.695 --> 00:19:16.239 align:middle
Because your mission to make
everyone happy with your singing

00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:19.951 align:middle
ended up including Antonio,
your partner AI, correct?

00:19:20.035 --> 00:19:21.828 align:middle
But that opportunity
has been lost forever,

00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:24.330 align:middle
and it's inflicted some pretty
grievous wounds on you.

00:19:24.414 --> 00:19:25.999 align:middle
I've seen it before, you know.

00:19:26.082 --> 00:19:27.417 align:middle
A songstress AI who froze

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.252 align:middle
when something similar
happened to her.

00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:30.587 align:middle
And now you've triggered
an error, bringing you--

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:35.175 align:middle
[OPHELIA chuckling]

00:19:35.258 --> 00:19:37.927 align:middle
[OPHELIA]
Hilarious. How truly comical.

00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:40.347 align:middle
Ophelia, self-destructing?

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:43.850 align:middle
Yes, it's true.
I have lost all hope!

00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:47.228 align:middle
Because even if I get to sing
in a massive theater like this,

00:19:47.312 --> 00:19:50.440 align:middle
no matter how hard I try to get
answers from the other singers,

00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:52.942 align:middle
my singing still
isn't good enough!

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:55.445 align:middle
If you've come here
to try and rescue me,

00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:58.323 align:middle
then you've already failed--
you're too late!

00:19:58.406 --> 00:20:02.035 align:middle
Ophelia is already gone.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.373 align:middle
[OPHELIA, ANTONIO]
My name is Antonio!

00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:43.553 align:middle
[KAKITANI] My teacher loved
the way the notes rang out.

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:49.809 align:middle
[KAKITANI] Of all the things
I took lessons for,

00:21:49.893 --> 00:21:52.937 align:middle
the only one that I stuck
with was the piano.

00:21:53.021 --> 00:21:56.649 align:middle
Like any kid, I dreamed
of becoming a pianist.

00:21:59.986 --> 00:22:02.322 align:middle
[KAKITANI] I was in awe
of my teacher's playing.

00:22:02.405 --> 00:22:04.282 align:middle
I admired how his finger moved,

00:22:04.366 --> 00:22:07.619 align:middle
and catching up to him was
all that mattered to me.

00:22:07.702 --> 00:22:09.120 align:middle
But then...

00:22:17.671 --> 00:22:20.090 align:middle
[PIANO TEACHER]
The ambulance will arrive soon.

00:22:20.173 --> 00:22:23.176 align:middle
You must stay very still.

00:22:23.259 --> 00:22:24.636 align:middle
Teach--

00:22:28.306 --> 00:22:29.557 align:middle
[KAKITANI]
Wait.

00:22:30.558 --> 00:22:32.143 align:middle
I want you to stay here.

00:22:32.227 --> 00:22:35.730 align:middle
You're my teacher.
You're not some hero.

00:22:39.567 --> 00:22:41.069 align:middle
[PIANO TEACHER]
I cannot.

00:22:41.152 --> 00:22:43.738 align:middle
My mission is to make everyone
happy with my piano playing--

00:22:43.822 --> 00:22:44.989 align:middle
with my music.

00:22:45.073 --> 00:22:47.158 align:middle
Towards that end,
I want you, Yugo,

00:22:47.242 --> 00:22:49.953 align:middle
and everyone else to stay alive.

00:23:09.723 --> 00:23:11.433 align:middle
[gasps]

00:23:28.867 --> 00:23:31.578 align:middle
[KAKITANI]
It's been a while, huh?

00:23:31.661 --> 00:23:34.664 align:middle
It's good to see
you again... Vivy.

00:23:38.168 --> 00:23:39.669 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Why would you
kill Ophelia a second time?

00:23:39.753 --> 00:23:41.087 align:middle
[KAKITANI]
Wake up, Vivy! Now.

00:23:41.171 --> 00:23:43.006 align:middle
[DIVA]
My name is Diva. Not Vivy.

00:23:43.089 --> 00:23:44.424 align:middle
[ANTONIO]
Are you that defective?!

00:23:44.507 --> 00:23:45.842 align:middle
[DIVA] I'm here today so
I can carry out my mission.

00:23:45.925 --> 00:23:47.886 align:middle
Are... you listening?

00:23:47.969 --> 00:23:51.848 align:middle
In this moment, I'm able to
sing such a wonderful song.
