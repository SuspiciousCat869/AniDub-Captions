I want you to be
on the main stage.

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:50.929 align:middle

to set a deadline.

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:24.004 align:middle
I simply promised that I would.

sing with that goal in mind.

the first day you met her,

00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:42.869 align:middle
is because I took the liberty
of toggling you off.

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:44.871 align:middle
Oh, and don't worry,
your body is fine.

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:47.415 align:middle
See? They're about
to cart you away.

00:11:47.499 --> 00:11:48.958 align:middle
Shall I introduce myself?

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:50.210 align:middle
I'm Model Number--

00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:52.087 align:middle
Actually, it's complicated.
I shouldn't say.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.546 align:middle
So, for the time being,

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.340 align:middle
I'll just assume the name
of my developer, Matsumoto.

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:57.217 align:middle
This is the start of a
very long relationship,

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.426 align:middle
so let's try to get
along, all right?

00:11:58.510 --> 00:11:59.678 align:middle
[VIVY]
What are you talking--?

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:00.637 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] I'm a program
that traveled here

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.389 align:middle
from 100 years in the future.

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:05.475 align:middle
My objective, to make
a long story short...

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:07.102 align:middle
...is to have you assist me.

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:08.436 align:middle
Over the next 100 years,

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.481 align:middle
I'd like for you to join me
in destroying the AIs.

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:16.820 align:middle
[DOCTOR A] Do you think
you can focus? Try it.

00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:24.119 align:middle
[DOCTOR A]
Good morning.

00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:26.996 align:middle
Good morning to you as well.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.082 align:middle
Thank you for performing
maintenance on me.

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:30.375 align:middle
[DOCTOR A]
When they carried you in here,

00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:31.876 align:middle
it took me by surprise.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.420 align:middle
But everything's looking good.

00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:36.214 align:middle
Now what is your
self-recognition telling you?

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:39.426 align:middle
An odd program seems to have
started running on its own.

00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:42.012 align:middle
[DOCTOR A] Hmm...
Must be some kind of error.

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:43.346 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Did he just call me an error?

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.056 align:middle
How rude! It's the opposite.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.601 align:middle
No program is more
flawless than me!

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:50.562 align:middle
[DOCTOR A]
Hmm...

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:53.148 align:middle
[thud]

00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:56.317 align:middle
Are the results indicating that
there are no abnormalities?

00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:57.444 align:middle
[DOCTOR A]
That's correct.

00:12:57.527 --> 00:12:58.903 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Shouldn't that be obvious?

00:12:58.987 --> 00:13:01.614 align:middle
I'm a super-AI from
100 years in the future.

00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:03.199 align:middle
And the security protocol
in this era is--

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:05.827 align:middle
[VIVY] I'm warning you for the
tenth time to remove yourself.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:06.995 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
And my tenth response is,

00:13:07.078 --> 00:13:08.621 align:middle
"Come on! Don't be like that!"

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:10.040 align:middle
Let's talk this out.

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:11.875 align:middle
[VIVY] I have nothing
more to say to you.

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.710 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Everything starts
with a simple conversation,

00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:14.919 align:middle
you know.

00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:16.087 align:middle
For example, have you
ever heard this one?

00:13:16.171 --> 00:13:17.005 align:middle
Take two people, right?

00:13:17.088 --> 00:13:18.381 align:middle
One's a boring but hot guy,

00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:19.966 align:middle
and the other's an interesting
but not-so-hot guy--

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:23.094 align:middle
[VIVY] Please remove yourself.
I must perform onstage tomorrow.

00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:24.721 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] No one will come
to see you tomorrow.

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:27.098 align:middle
It's already in the
future's record books.

00:13:31.102 --> 00:13:33.104 align:middle
[VIVY]
Please remove yourself.

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:38.109 align:middle
Navi.

00:13:38.193 --> 00:13:39.819 align:middle
[NAVI] What could you
possibly want at this hour?

00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:41.071 align:middle
I was asleep, you know.

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:43.239 align:middle
Please raise the level
of this room's firewall.

00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:45.617 align:middle
Don't allow a single
unnecessary byte through.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.994 align:middle
[NAVI] What? That's gonna
be such a hassle!

00:13:48.078 --> 00:13:49.371 align:middle
It doesn't matter. Follow...

00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:50.914 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Seems like Navi's
communication circuits

00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:52.290 align:middle
are more developed than yours.

00:13:52.374 --> 00:13:54.042 align:middle
That response sounded natural.

00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:55.710 align:middle
I think it'd do you well
to spend more time

00:13:55.794 --> 00:13:56.920 align:middle
talking to people.

00:13:57.003 --> 00:14:00.215 align:middle
Ugh! Why does this body
have to be so itchy?

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:01.675 align:middle
[NAVI]
Hey, what's that thing?

00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:04.177 align:middle
How did you get
a pet without me?

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.596 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] You're gonna keep
quiet for a bit, all right?

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:11.351 align:middle
Now then... images from
100 years in the future.

00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:12.560 align:middle
On this day--

00:14:12.644 --> 00:14:14.270 align:middle
well, for me it was only
a little while ago--

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:17.190 align:middle
all across the world,
AIs went on a violent rampage,

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:21.945 align:middle
unleashing military force
directly onto humans.

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:23.780 align:middle
Within only a few minutes
of the first clash,

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:25.990 align:middle
there were more than
10,000 casualties.

00:14:26.074 --> 00:14:28.368 align:middle
You can't say they
lack diligence.

00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:33.289 align:middle
Please hold on a moment.

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:35.917 align:middle
Oh, you're curious about this?
That makes sense.

00:14:36.001 --> 00:14:38.837 align:middle
This is NiaLand's main
stage, after all.

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:43.633 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] The AIs there were
no exception to the phenomenon.

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:45.010 align:middle
For example, this girl here,

00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:47.429 align:middle
well, I guess you could
call her your successor.

00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:49.305 align:middle
Though by this time,
she'd already been reduced

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:51.516 align:middle
to no more than a mere bot.

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:55.979 align:middle
This is the future
we're going to change.

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:58.440 align:middle
You and me together as a team.

00:14:58.523 --> 00:15:00.275 align:middle
That is impossible.

00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:02.402 align:middle
This must be a fabrication.

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:03.945 align:middle
Please remove yourself.

00:15:04.029 --> 00:15:07.032 align:middle
That is a birthday present given
to me by an important guest.

00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:09.492 align:middle
That makes 11 now, but,
"Come on! Don't be like that!"

00:15:09.576 --> 00:15:10.952 align:middle
And the person who gave you this

00:15:11.036 --> 00:15:12.746 align:middle
was Miss Momoka
Kirishima, right?

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:14.789 align:middle
I don't understand what
you're so worried about!

00:15:14.873 --> 00:15:18.668 align:middle
It just got a massive upgrade
now that I'm occupying it.

00:15:20.962 --> 00:15:22.339 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Whoop-whoop!

00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:26.926 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Woo! Wee!

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:29.763 align:middle
So close! Whew.

00:15:29.846 --> 00:15:31.014 align:middle
Gah!

00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:39.147 align:middle
[PA ANNOUNCER A]
Welcome to Nialand!

00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:51.910 align:middle
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you for listening.

00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:07.425 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Now do you believe me?

00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:09.135 align:middle
No one was in the
audience, right?

00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:11.137 align:middle
[VIVY]
That is hardly unusual.

00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:13.807 align:middle
It could be speculated
without future knowledge.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.892 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Don't you feel
empty inside saying that?

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:17.018 align:middle
[VIVY]
I do not.

00:16:17.102 --> 00:16:18.269 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Why don't you just give in

00:16:18.353 --> 00:16:20.438 align:middle
and save the world with me?

00:16:22.065 --> 00:16:23.817 align:middle
[BOY A laughs]

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.361 align:middle
Giving in is a vital part
of life, too, you know!

00:16:26.444 --> 00:16:28.613 align:middle
Besides, it's not like your
audience is gonna grow.

00:16:28.697 --> 00:16:30.281 align:middle
You look and sound
so rigid onstage,

00:16:30.365 --> 00:16:31.616 align:middle
how could that be appealing?

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.077 align:middle
[VIVY] When I'm on stage,
I always smile.

00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:36.871 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] But that's just
another program, isn't it?

00:16:36.955 --> 00:16:39.124 align:middle
In other words, you're a
soulless humanoid computer

00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:40.625 align:middle
who simply traces lyrics set to

00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:43.420 align:middle
the pre-scripted
notes of a song.

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:45.964 align:middle
[VIVY]
So what if I am?

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:47.215 align:middle
My mission has always been

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:49.009 align:middle
to make everyone happy
with my singing,

00:16:49.092 --> 00:16:50.468 align:middle
and that is the
one and only reason

00:16:50.552 --> 00:16:52.637 align:middle
that I continue to operate.

00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:54.514 align:middle
Please remove yourself.

00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:56.349 align:middle
I do not believe anything
that you have said.

00:16:56.433 --> 00:16:59.144 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Well, I have a mission myself.

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:01.229 align:middle
And mine happens to involve
collaborating with you

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:04.190 align:middle
on this vitally
important project.

00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:06.234 align:middle
This situation isn't gonna
end with me saying,

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:08.862 align:middle
"Oh well, that's
too bad. Goodbye."

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:12.157 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO sighs]

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.825 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Then how about we do this?

00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:15.493 align:middle
If what I'm about to
tell you comes true,

00:17:15.577 --> 00:17:17.662 align:middle
then I want you to cooperate.

00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:20.915 align:middle
Since it won't be long now.

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:23.168 align:middle
You can see that, right?

00:17:23.251 --> 00:17:25.086 align:middle
11:03 and 59 seconds.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:28.048 align:middle
This man will suffer broken
bones and burns.

00:17:34.929 --> 00:17:36.348 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
See that trash can over there?

00:17:36.431 --> 00:17:37.807 align:middle
It's about to explode.

00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:39.642 align:middle
So... what're you gonna do?

00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:41.644 align:middle
Well, it is possible,
if you're right about me,

00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:43.480 align:middle
that nothing will happen at all.

00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:44.731 align:middle
But if you do wanna stop it,

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:46.149 align:middle
even taking your
speed into account,

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:47.609 align:middle
this is cutting it close.

00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:51.988 align:middle
Way close! Ten, nine,
eight, seven.

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:53.448 align:middle
Exactly.

00:17:53.531 --> 00:17:55.283 align:middle
And that's why I believe that
for AIs to truly evolve,

00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:56.242 align:middle
it's imperative.

00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:58.328 align:middle
We must pass the Naming Law.

00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:00.705 align:middle
[STAFF C]
Huh?

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.307 align:middle
[AIKAWA] The AI Naming Law
is so much more

00:18:19.391 --> 00:18:21.685 align:middle
than just a basic mandate
to enforce the naming

00:18:21.768 --> 00:18:22.977 align:middle
of all of our AIs.

00:18:23.061 --> 00:18:24.729 align:middle
Although its scope
is currently limited,

00:18:24.813 --> 00:18:27.524 align:middle
the law will also grant AIs
a lot of the same rights

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:29.943 align:middle
that we humans have,
allowing them to become more--

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:31.945 align:middle
Everyone, get down!

00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:33.196 align:middle
[AIKAWA]
Huh?

00:18:35.949 --> 00:18:37.450 align:middle
[BODYGUARD A groans]

00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:38.743 align:middle

out in the park.

All park visitors,

please follow the

00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:17.490 align:middle
or allow staff to guide you.

Keep your distance, please!

00:19:24.122 --> 00:19:27.417 align:middle
Thank you so much.
That was a close call.

[VIVY] My pleasure.
Did you sustain any injuries?

00:19:30.462 --> 00:19:33.798 align:middle
No, nothing serious anyway.

And what about you?

[VIVY] Nice to meet you.
Welcome to NiaLand.

00:19:38.803 --> 00:19:43.058 align:middle
I perform live on stage in
this park. My name is Diva.

00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:47.812 align:middle
Actually, I was wondering if you
were hurt during all of that.

00:19:47.896 --> 00:19:50.732 align:middle
Right. I apologize.
I misunderstood.

00:19:50.815 --> 00:19:52.609 align:middle
I have sustained no injuries.

00:19:52.692 --> 00:19:54.736 align:middle
You know, I've heard
your name before.

00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:56.988 align:middle
You're the very first
autonomous AI, right?

00:19:57.072 --> 00:19:59.407 align:middle
I think his escape route
has now been secured.

00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:02.285 align:middle
Right. I really appreciate
what you did for me today.

00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:03.995 align:middle
And you mentioned
you're a singer, right?

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:05.830 align:middle
I didn't get the chance
to see your show,

00:20:05.914 --> 00:20:08.166 align:middle
but I'd like to hear
you sing one day.

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:10.710 align:middle
You think it was the people

00:20:10.794 --> 00:20:12.253 align:middle
who sent those threatening
letters, or what?

00:20:12.337 --> 00:20:13.505 align:middle
[AIKAWA]
We don't know for sure,

00:20:13.588 --> 00:20:15.215 align:middle
but let's get
everyone out of here.

00:20:15.298 --> 00:20:16.675 align:middle
[STAFF AI A]
Diva.

00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:24.474 align:middle
[STAFF AI A]
That is all for now.

00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:27.560 align:middle
Due to the situation, movement
restrictions are lifted.

00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:28.978 align:middle
Regardless of position,

00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:32.023 align:middle
all AIs are to search the area
for suspicious items.

00:20:32.107 --> 00:20:33.608 align:middle
[VIVY]
Understood.

00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:42.951 align:middle
[VIVY] The main stage is
currently functioning normally.

00:20:43.034 --> 00:20:44.536 align:middle
No suspicious items.

00:20:44.619 --> 00:20:47.163 align:middle
[RECEPTIONIST A]
Copy that. Stand by.

00:21:05.932 --> 00:21:07.058 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
How does it feel to be standing

00:21:07.142 --> 00:21:10.520 align:middle
on the main stage
for the first time?

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:13.189 align:middle
I hate to break it to you,
but the war 100 years from now

00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:15.817 align:middle
will make today's commotion
seem like nothing.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.361 align:middle
[VIVY] That disturbance was not
your handiwork, was it?

00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:19.904 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
There you go again!

00:21:19.988 --> 00:21:21.072 align:middle
Should I give you
the winning numbers

00:21:21.156 --> 00:21:23.074 align:middle
for tomorrow's lottery, too?

00:21:23.158 --> 00:21:24.117 align:middle
[VIVY]
Is it true?

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.411 align:middle
That you came here
from the future?

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:27.537 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Absolutely.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.749 align:middle
I want you to stop
this from happening.

00:21:30.832 --> 00:21:32.167 align:middle
As I have said before,

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.586 align:middle
my mission is to make everyone
happy with my singing.

00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:36.588 align:middle
You mean the one mission
per AI mandate?

00:21:36.671 --> 00:21:38.840 align:middle
That law hasn't changed
100 years from now.

00:21:38.923 --> 00:21:40.884 align:middle
But with that in mind,
do you really want the world

00:21:40.967 --> 00:21:43.261 align:middle
to end up the way
you see it here?

00:21:43.345 --> 00:21:44.721 align:middle
No, of course I would
not want that--

00:21:44.804 --> 00:21:45.889 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Then in accordance
with your mission,

00:21:45.972 --> 00:21:47.098 align:middle
let me say this.

00:21:47.182 --> 00:21:48.475 align:middle
None of the people who
are alive right now

00:21:48.558 --> 00:21:50.518 align:middle
will still be living
100 years from now.

00:21:50.602 --> 00:21:51.978 align:middle
But what about
their descendants,

00:21:52.062 --> 00:21:56.733 align:middle
your future audience members,
who have yet to be born?

00:21:56.816 --> 00:21:59.611 align:middle
Right now, things may be
friendly between humans and AIs,

00:21:59.694 --> 00:22:02.364 align:middle
but over the next hundred years,
AIs will evolve rapidly.

00:22:02.447 --> 00:22:04.074 align:middle
And the catalyst
responsible for that

00:22:04.157 --> 00:22:07.243 align:middle
is a major measure known
as the AI Naming Law.

00:22:07.327 --> 00:22:08.661 align:middle
[VIVY]
The AI Naming Law?

00:22:08.745 --> 00:22:11.039 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] For example,
right now, your moniker, Diva,

00:22:11.122 --> 00:22:12.582 align:middle
is nothing more than a nickname.

00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:13.667 align:middle
But a few months from now,

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.293 align:middle
once the law is passed
and enforced,

00:22:15.377 --> 00:22:17.754 align:middle
it will also grant some
level of social freedom.

00:22:17.837 --> 00:22:20.715 align:middle
Meaning AIs will soon be given
the same rights as humans.

00:22:20.799 --> 00:22:24.219 align:middle
This laid the foundation for the
subsequent evolution of AIs.

00:22:24.302 --> 00:22:26.388 align:middle
The establishment of the
Naming Law has much to do

00:22:26.471 --> 00:22:27.972 align:middle
with the murder
of Yoichi Aikawa,

00:22:28.056 --> 00:22:31.142 align:middle
the assemblyman you saved from
that terrorist attack earlier.

00:22:31.226 --> 00:22:32.686 align:middle
Murder?

00:22:32.769 --> 00:22:34.062 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] That's the first
objective we need to accomplish.

00:22:34.145 --> 00:22:36.064 align:middle
That bomb that went off
earlier was just a warning.

00:22:36.147 --> 00:22:37.232 align:middle
After his death,

00:22:37.315 --> 00:22:38.817 align:middle
other assemblymen
were incited to action,

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.736 align:middle
ensuring he didn't die in vain,
which led to the law's passing.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.613 align:middle
In addition to the enforcement
of the Naming Law,

00:22:43.697 --> 00:22:46.491 align:middle
the next 100 years are filled
with major turning points

00:22:46.574 --> 00:22:48.118 align:middle
in the history of AIs.

00:22:48.201 --> 00:22:50.829 align:middle
That's why I was created--
to correct them,

00:22:50.912 --> 00:22:53.748 align:middle
and to ensure that the war in
which humans are murdered by AIs

00:22:53.832 --> 00:22:56.001 align:middle
is prevented from happening.

00:22:56.084 --> 00:22:59.504 align:middle
And this project was dubbed
the Singularity Project,

00:22:59.587 --> 00:23:02.757 align:middle
and it was brought about by
the professor who created me.

00:23:04.384 --> 00:23:06.386 align:middle
[AIKAWA] I really appreciate
what you did for me today.

00:23:06.469 --> 00:23:08.263 align:middle
And you mentioned that
you're a singer, right?

00:23:08.346 --> 00:23:09.931 align:middle
I didn't get the chance
to see your show,

00:23:10.015 --> 00:23:12.934 align:middle
but I'd like to hear
you sing one day.

00:23:13.018 --> 00:23:14.352 align:middle
[MOMOKA]
The next time I see you sing,

00:23:14.436 --> 00:23:16.354 align:middle
I want you to be
on the main stage.

00:23:16.438 --> 00:23:18.148 align:middle
Because I love your songs, Vivy,

00:23:18.231 --> 00:23:20.567 align:middle
and I want all kinds of
people to get to hear them.

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:22.235 align:middle
Promise me.

00:23:24.112 --> 00:23:26.239 align:middle
[VIVY]
Why... was I chosen?

00:23:26.322 --> 00:23:28.033 align:middle
I can't leave it up someone
who'd change their response

00:23:28.116 --> 00:23:29.451 align:middle
after hearing the answer, can I?

00:23:29.534 --> 00:23:31.828 align:middle
So is that a yes,
or perhaps an okay?

00:23:31.911 --> 00:23:32.912 align:middle
[VIVY]
When will it happen?

00:23:32.996 --> 00:23:34.581 align:middle
Wait, what?

00:23:35.707 --> 00:23:39.127 align:middle
When is Assemblyman Aikawa
going to be murdered?

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.881 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
That would be tonight.

00:23:47.385 --> 00:23:48.636 align:middle
[AIKAWA]
I understand,

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.722 align:middle
but I can't let something
like this scare me off.

00:23:50.805 --> 00:23:52.307 align:middle
If the Naming Law passes,

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:55.977 align:middle
we can lock in the votes from
the affiliated organizations.

00:23:56.061 --> 00:23:58.188 align:middle
Make sure you delete
the record of this call.

00:23:58.271 --> 00:23:59.939 align:middle
We can't risk letting
those blackmailers

00:24:00.023 --> 00:24:02.692 align:middle
get wind of this location.

00:24:02.776 --> 00:24:04.235 align:middle
Sure, it's all good.

00:24:04.319 --> 00:24:06.946 align:middle
No one's around here, except
when they're doing maintenance.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.282 align:middle
In fact, people rarely ever--

00:24:09.366 --> 00:24:10.825 align:middle
Huh?

00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:12.452 align:middle
What was that?

00:24:14.412 --> 00:24:15.163 align:middle
[gasps]

00:24:15.246 --> 00:24:16.831 align:middle
[AIKAWA]
Toak!

00:24:16.915 --> 00:24:18.667 align:middle
How did you find me here?

00:24:28.093 --> 00:24:29.302 align:middle
[AIKAWA]
Huh?

00:26:08.735 --> 00:26:11.071 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] That's easy,
it's because I don't trust you.

00:26:11.154 --> 00:26:13.239 align:middle
[VIVY] My one and only mission
is to make everyone happy...

00:26:13.323 --> 00:26:14.491 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
The professor was wrong

00:26:14.574 --> 00:26:15.909 align:middle
to stake everything on
you. It's ridiculous.

00:26:15.992 --> 00:26:17.827 align:middle
[VIVY] I'm going to need
you to stay alive.

00:26:17.911 --> 00:26:19.496 align:middle
And then one day you can
come listen to me sing.

00:26:19.579 --> 00:26:23.041 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] This is where your
100-year journey begins.
