00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:19.853 align:middle
[NAVI] They're saying
your show's sold out.

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:21.896 align:middle
You've been setting records
for main stage sales,

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.648 align:middle
and it doesn't seem
to be slowing down.

00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:25.066 align:middle
[DIVA]
Okay.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.401 align:middle
[NAVI] The staff for next
week's festival are here,

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:27.777 align:middle
so don't mess up, okay?

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:29.362 align:middle
Just who do you think I am?

[CROWD cheering]

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:36.786 align:middle
All right. It's showtime!

[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:12.841 align:middle
[STAGE MANAGER A]
That was great!

00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:15.677 align:middle
Good work, everyone! Yay!

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.888 align:middle
I'm so sorry. I carelessly
let that man through.

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:19.973 align:middle
Are you new here?

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:23.560 align:middle
Yes. I hope you
can forgive me!

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:25.311 align:middle
[DIVA chuckles]

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:26.855 align:middle
[DIVA]
Come on.

00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:30.483 align:middle
Never forget to smile in front
of the audience, all right?

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:32.861 align:middle
It's my theory: If you want
to make someone smile,

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:35.363 align:middle
then you must smile first.

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:38.450 align:middle
Okay!

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:40.744 align:middle
Just keep workin' hard, newbie!

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:43.121 align:middle
Oh, wow!

00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:45.540 align:middle
She wasn't always
like that, ya know.

00:02:45.623 --> 00:02:48.209 align:middle
She used to really
keep her distance.

00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:50.003 align:middle
Of course, that was a while ago.

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:51.629 align:middle
Before she was on
the main stage.

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:53.715 align:middle
[DIVA STAFF C]
No way. Really?

00:02:53.798 --> 00:02:56.176 align:middle
[DIVA] So, how many accolades
did I manage to collect

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:57.761 align:middle
from the festival staff today?

00:02:57.844 --> 00:02:58.928 align:middle
[NAVI]
You're a shoo-in.

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.680 align:middle
They're asking you
to close out the show.

00:03:00.764 --> 00:03:03.183 align:middle
Then it seems they have
an eye for talent.

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:04.893 align:middle
Better work hard, then.

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:07.437 align:middle
[NAVI] Still, who would've
thought an old clunker like you

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.939 align:middle
would rise up to close
out the festival, huh?

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:10.940 align:middle
[DIVA]
Hey, watch it.

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.776 align:middle
Wanna get turned
into a calculator?

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.986 align:middle
[NAVI] Where'd you pick up
that novelty of a threat?

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.112 align:middle
[DIVA]
Who knows?

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:17.739 align:middle
I'm sure I heard it
somewhere before.

00:03:17.822 --> 00:03:19.783 align:middle
[NAVI]
Oh, no, is your memory, okay?

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:22.577 align:middle
I don't wanna hear you freakin'
out about some virus again.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.287 align:middle
[DIVA] Really? You had
to bring that up?

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:26.539 align:middle
[NAVI] At one point,
you babbled nonstop.

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:29.501 align:middle
First about a virus, then some
kind of external contact.

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:33.546 align:middle
You even dragged that
teddy bear around with you.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.882 align:middle
No way. Are you sure
that was me?

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:38.927 align:middle
[NAVI] You're the only one I'm
in charge of. You know that.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.513 align:middle
Well, there was the time you
went through a major freeze,

00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:44.015 align:middle
but you seemed totally
stable since the reboot.

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.018 align:middle
Exactly. So there's
nothing to worry about.

00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:49.729 align:middle
Do you have any idea how
excited people get to see me?

00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:52.065 align:middle
The applause is insane!

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:56.903 align:middle
The festival will be as
flawless as everything I do.

00:03:56.986 --> 00:04:00.573 align:middle
You know, in order to make
everyone happy with my singing.

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:08.081 align:middle
[ARCHIVE] As you know,
the Zodiac Signs Festival

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:12.419 align:middle
is a large musical celebration
featuring 12 songstress AIs.

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:16.256 align:middle
They are gathered from all over
the globe to sing in one place.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.591 align:middle
As its name implies,
the performances will be held in

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:23.179 align:middle
zodiac-themed venues, featuring
all 12 astrological signs.

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:25.223 align:middle
The repercussions of
the Metal Float Incident

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:27.475 align:middle
from many years ago
can still be felt today

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:30.270 align:middle
through the ongoing strife
between humans and AIs.

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:32.564 align:middle
Celebrating its 12th
anniversary this year,

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.983 align:middle
this festival aims to
dispel that discord,

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:37.193 align:middle
and serve as a bridge
between AIs and humans.

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:38.737 align:middle
[DIVA]
Stop.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.116 align:middle
Now, that is a great theme!
A bridge between humans and AIs.

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.785 align:middle
Mhm! I can work with that.

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:52.792 align:middle

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:54.377 align:middle

Hm?

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:56.296 align:middle
Were you in the
Archive just now?

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:57.464 align:middle
Yes, I was.

00:04:57.547 --> 00:04:59.549 align:middle
I was just wondering
about my performance

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:01.092 align:middle
at the festival today.

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:05.263 align:middle
Oh? So even superstars don't
have it all figured out, huh?

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:14.898 align:middle
[KATIE] I'd like to welcome you,
our legendary maven of song,

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.692 align:middle
to the Zodiac Signs Festival!

00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:20.779 align:middle
Thanks for the warm welcome,
both of you, Katie and Margaret.

00:05:20.862 --> 00:05:23.156 align:middle
It's nice to meet you
both in person finally!

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:24.741 align:middle
[DIVA chuckles]

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:28.578 align:middle
So you finally made it here.

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:31.164 align:middle
Right? I just can't
wait to hear you sing.

00:05:31.247 --> 00:05:32.749 align:middle
So you don't have an entourage?

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:33.917 align:middle
What do you mean?

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.126 align:middle
[KATIE]
I was expecting there to be

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.170 align:middle
a whole procession behind you!

00:05:37.253 --> 00:05:40.340 align:middle

weren't any volunteers.

can give us a hand?

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:02.737 align:middle
I'm terribly sorry for causing
you so much trouble, Diva.

00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:04.489 align:middle
Quit moving.
Look straight ahead.

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:06.199 align:middle
Oh, sorry.

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.746 align:middle
[DIVA]

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.456 align:middle
Adorable!

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.876 align:middle
Thank you so much for your help!

sister Diva, aren't you?

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:24.592 align:middle
Uhh... Yes.

00:06:24.676 --> 00:06:26.803 align:middle
Um, my name is Ophelia.

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:30.015 align:middle
And I'm-I'm the youngest
of all the Sisters.

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:34.185 align:middle
Oh, yes, I know. I've been
hearing a lot about you.

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:37.313 align:middle
They call you the "Fairy
of the Small Theater," right?

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.774 align:middle
[OPHELIA]
I am so honored.

00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:41.026 align:middle
[DIVA]
Are you nervous?

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:42.610 align:middle
Well, yes.

00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:45.780 align:middle
It's my first time performing
at the Zodiac Signs Festival.

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:49.117 align:middle
It's my first time
performing here, too.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.786 align:middle
It's just my theory,
but here's the thing.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.039 align:middle
When the audience experiences
something incredible,

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:55.957 align:middle
they get frozen in awe.

00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:58.126 align:middle
They just stand there,
completely dazed

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:01.254 align:middle
by the overwhelming world
before their eyes.

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:04.382 align:middle
[DIVA]
Look straight ahead as you sing,

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:07.177 align:middle
and then send them
into a daze, all right?

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.804 align:middle
You really do have an
amazing voice, you know.

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:12.724 align:middle
As expected of
my younger sister!

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:15.518 align:middle
Right. I will sing
with all my heart.

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:19.272 align:middle
So that... I can
become my true self.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.486 align:middle
But come on now.
Your "Big Sister," really?

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:26.946 align:middle
Why do I suddenly feel
so much older?

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.783 align:middle
But, Big Sister, you were
always older than me.

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:31.701 align:middle
Let's see...

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:33.620 align:middle
Oh! Sixty-one years old!

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:37.457 align:middle
Amazing! I've met lots of AIs,
but you're the oldest one!

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.751 align:middle
Listen, Ophelia.

00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:42.796 align:middle
When you're talking
to a female AI,

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:45.382 align:middle
it's considered to be rude to
describe her body as heavy,

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:47.008 align:middle
or to bring up her
production date.

00:07:47.092 --> 00:07:48.218 align:middle

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:49.552 align:middle

make it to rehearsal?

Oh, yes, of course!

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:52.514 align:middle
I'm really sorry;
everything's fine here!

00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:53.932 align:middle
I'll head over right away!

[FESTIVAL STAFF C]
Okay, we're good!

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:01.189 align:middle
[DIRECTOR A] Great. Seems
everything's in working order.

00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:03.775 align:middle
But I think we can make it
even better. What if...

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:06.319 align:middle
Give it your best out there.

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:11.991 align:middle
You need to stand up straight!

00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:13.618 align:middle
All right!

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:18.790 align:middle
This is only a sound
check, so relax, okay?

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:22.210 align:middle
Yes. I think I'm ready now.

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:24.379 align:middle
I thought her video
performance was great, but--

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:26.256 align:middle
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:27.841 align:middle

at the performance.

honor to have you here, Diva.

Do you have any requests
before we start?

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:07.357 align:middle
[DIVA] Since you asked, after
giving me your kind attention,

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.234 align:middle
how about some
heartfelt applause?

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:04.516 align:middle
Thank you for
rescuing me just now.

00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:06.393 align:middle
Mind telling me who you are?

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:09.729 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Just a humble
guard AI, that's all.

00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:12.148 align:middle
It seems there's some sort
of virus going around.

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:15.443 align:middle
What a pain, huh?
Flu season, that is.

00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:18.446 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Be sure to take
care of yourself, too.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:19.572 align:middle
Now I'll be on my way.

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:20.699 align:middle
[DIVA]
Are you mocking me?

00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:22.283 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Hm?

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:24.577 align:middle
I asked you who you were and all
you gave me was that nonsense.

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:25.662 align:middle
You called me Vivy,

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:26.788 align:middle
a name I've never
even heard before,

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:29.833 align:middle
and you expect me to let it go?

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:31.751 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] My sincerest
apologies for calling you

00:12:31.835 --> 00:12:32.961 align:middle
by the wrong name.

00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:35.380 align:middle
It'll never happen again,
Songstress Diva.

00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:38.591 align:middle
That's right. My name is Diva.

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:44.347 align:middle
But somehow... it felt
like it was familiar.

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:46.808 align:middle
Vivy.

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:48.643 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Maybe get your
auditory circuits checked?

00:12:48.727 --> 00:12:52.564 align:middle
How about this company?
The reviews are quite good.

00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:55.567 align:middle
Hey! Just answer
my question. Uh!

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:56.943 align:middle
[gasps]

00:12:58.737 --> 00:13:00.030 align:middle
Hey!

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:03.992 align:middle
[OPHELIA gasps]

00:13:12.751 --> 00:13:14.836 align:middle
S-Sorry to trouble you again.

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:16.504 align:middle
Don't worry,
it's not your fault.

00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:19.299 align:middle
You were just looking
for me after all.

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:22.427 align:middle
So, um, what exactly
happened back there?

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.513 align:middle
Was it a tummy ache
or something?

00:13:25.597 --> 00:13:28.266 align:middle
Well, I haven't eaten a thing
since the day I was born,

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.018 align:middle
and I have never been nervous.

00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:32.187 align:middle
It's just there was this
blabbermouth of a cube

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.481 align:middle
that was totally tormenting me.

00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:36.691 align:middle
What was his problem?

00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:38.902 align:middle
Oh! So, um--

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:40.779 align:middle
There you go! All done!

00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:43.656 align:middle
I'm sorry about that.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:44.949 align:middle
Huh?

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:47.827 align:middle
I, uh, I was wondering,
Big Sister Diva,

00:13:47.911 --> 00:13:50.246 align:middle
how did you learn to sing
so beautifully like that?

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.289 align:middle
Huh?

00:13:51.373 --> 00:13:52.832 align:middle
I have watched every
single second

00:13:52.916 --> 00:13:55.752 align:middle
of your live performance
data from NiaLand.

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:57.962 align:middle
It's all so captivating!

00:13:58.046 --> 00:14:00.131 align:middle
Well, we just want our
guests to feel comfortable

00:14:00.215 --> 00:14:02.175 align:middle
and enjoy themselves, you know?

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:05.220 align:middle
It's been a theory of mine.

00:14:05.303 --> 00:14:09.015 align:middle
A theory... of mine...

00:14:09.099 --> 00:14:10.767 align:middle
Is something wrong?

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.143 align:middle
[DIVA grunts]

00:14:12.227 --> 00:14:14.354 align:middle
What about you? How'd you
learn to sing like that?

00:14:14.437 --> 00:14:17.148 align:middle
I thought your performance at
the rehearsal today was amazing!

00:14:17.232 --> 00:14:18.942 align:middle
Oh! Thanks so much!

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:21.277 align:middle
I just really love
to sing is all!

00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:22.904 align:middle
I used to have a sound AI,

00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:26.449 align:middle
and we traveled to all kinds
of wonderful places together.

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:29.285 align:middle
All kinds of places, huh?

00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:33.289 align:middle
And are you able to remember
each and every one of them?

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:36.668 align:middle
Yes, of course I can!
Each memory is precious!

00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:38.378 align:middle
Even if they may
seem insignificant,

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:40.797 align:middle
they mean a lot to me!

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.173 align:middle
Yes, of course.

00:14:42.257 --> 00:14:45.176 align:middle
That is such a nice
way of putting it!

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:14.414 align:middle
[DIVA] Hey! Guard AI
from before, you there?

00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:16.916 align:middle
If you can hear me,
show yourself.

00:15:19.502 --> 00:15:21.129 align:middle
[DIVA]
I did some digging after we met,

00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:22.422 align:middle
and I couldn't find any record

00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:24.841 align:middle
of a guard AI of your
make and model.

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:26.426 align:middle
What you're doing's illegal.

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:30.305 align:middle
Come out right now, or else I'll
report you to all the agencies.

00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:32.515 align:middle
Three, two, on--!

00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:36.061 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Okay, fine,
stop. You win! You win!

00:15:36.144 --> 00:15:38.188 align:middle
But seriously,
what's your problem?

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:40.899 align:middle
Could you be any more impatient?

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:43.401 align:middle
Time to tell me
the truth right now!

00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:46.529 align:middle
This Vivy you speak of,
is she really me?

00:15:46.613 --> 00:15:48.073 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Huh?

00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:50.742 align:middle
Who exactly are you and what's
your reason for coming here?

00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:52.327 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Wa-- H-Hold up--

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:55.080 align:middle
Tell me everything you know and
what your intentions are now!

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:56.164 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
I told you!

00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:58.458 align:middle
I'm just a simple,
everyday guard AI.

00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:00.794 align:middle
And I have no relationship
with you whatsoever.

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:02.462 align:middle
I'm going to turn
you in to security

00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:04.255 align:middle
and have them extract your data!

00:16:04.339 --> 00:16:05.840 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Oh, be my guest.

00:16:05.924 --> 00:16:09.302 align:middle
It's not like my firewall can be
breached by their dinosaur tech.

00:16:09.386 --> 00:16:11.680 align:middle
You'll never catch me anyway.

00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:14.641 align:middle
[DIVA grumbles]

00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:16.059 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Let it go, head back
inside, and forget about me.

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:17.686 align:middle
I admit it would be
a huge inconvenience

00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:19.813 align:middle
if you reported me, but it would
be a problem for you, too,

00:16:19.896 --> 00:16:21.356 align:middle
since you're supposed
to be on stage soon.

00:16:21.439 --> 00:16:23.942 align:middle
[DIVA] You're familiar with the
famous formula, are you not?

00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:27.946 align:middle
E=MC squared. Energy is
dependent upon mass.

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:29.280 align:middle
I hate admitting it,

00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:32.242 align:middle
but my dead weight happens
to be over 80 kilograms.

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:34.452 align:middle
You say you and I have nothing
to do with each other,

00:16:34.536 --> 00:16:38.164 align:middle
but you went out of
your way to save me.

00:16:38.248 --> 00:16:39.290 align:middle
If I were to break down,

00:16:39.374 --> 00:16:40.959 align:middle
it wouldn't be good
for you, would it?

00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:42.460 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Are you trying to threaten me?

00:16:42.544 --> 00:16:44.170 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO screams]

00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:46.089 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
You've gotta be kidding!

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.683 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] What's wrong
with you?! Are you crazy?!

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:57.892 align:middle
I should be asking you!

00:16:57.976 --> 00:17:00.186 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Stop! You're squashing me!

00:17:02.772 --> 00:17:03.857 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO screams]

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.108 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO grunts]

00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:15.285 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
I am so outta here.

00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:20.123 align:middle
[DIVA]
Why did you call me Vivy?

00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:22.959 align:middle
Why are you constantly
trying to save me?

00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:24.711 align:middle
Why did my body move
on its own like that

00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:26.212 align:middle
when I was being attacked?

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:30.592 align:middle
If you know, please tell me
about this other person

00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:33.053 align:middle
that's inside of me.

00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:34.471 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Huh?

00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:38.058 align:middle
[DIVA] Ever since I was
rebooted ages ago,

00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:41.770 align:middle
there's something that's
always been bothering me.

00:17:41.853 --> 00:17:43.772 align:middle
But allowing that anxiety
to weigh on me

00:17:43.855 --> 00:17:46.816 align:middle
would affect my singing,
so that's why I pushed it down

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.694 align:middle
and kept a lid on
it all this time.

00:17:49.778 --> 00:17:53.114 align:middle
But you just ripped
it off, so answer me!

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:02.874 align:middle
I'm sure that it was something
very important, too.

00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:07.128 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Why don't you head back for now?

00:18:07.212 --> 00:18:11.174 align:middle
Everybody's waiting for you,
Songstress Diva.

00:18:13.468 --> 00:18:15.845 align:middle
Fine. Then I'll just
go ask the other one.

00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:17.555 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
What the what now?

00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:19.140 align:middle
I'm sick of your lies.

00:18:19.224 --> 00:18:20.558 align:middle
I've got it all figured out.

00:18:20.642 --> 00:18:22.060 align:middle
There was that young
guy, remember?

00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:23.812 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Hold on a second! A young guy?

00:18:23.895 --> 00:18:25.021 align:middle
Who would that be?!

00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:27.065 align:middle
Did he seem to know
something about you?!

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.609 align:middle
So you don't know.

00:18:29.693 --> 00:18:31.111 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Just answer me, please!

00:18:31.194 --> 00:18:33.321 align:middle
Ahh.

00:18:33.405 --> 00:18:35.824 align:middle
Do you seriously expect
me to just tell you?

00:18:35.907 --> 00:18:38.451 align:middle
After you refused to
answer my questions?

00:18:38.535 --> 00:18:39.786 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO grumbles]

00:18:39.869 --> 00:18:42.372 align:middle
There isn't much time, you know.

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:45.542 align:middle
Like you just said,
I'm keeping everyone waiting.

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:47.460 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO grumbles]

00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:52.257 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
A long time ago,

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.969 align:middle
I also used to do the
exact same job as you.

00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:59.014 align:middle
And back then, you went
by another name: Vivy.

00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:03.393 align:middle
Vivy. So it was me.
Where you a performer as well?

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:04.561 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
No, I was not.

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:06.980 align:middle
We had a much more
noble role to fulfil.

00:19:07.063 --> 00:19:08.648 align:middle
We did things like
destroying buildings,

00:19:08.732 --> 00:19:11.568 align:middle
traversing outer space,
and leveling enormous factories.

00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:13.653 align:middle
And we did all of it to
prevent a horrific war

00:19:13.737 --> 00:19:15.196 align:middle
from breaking out in the future.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.781 align:middle
Are your circuits okay?

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:19.659 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Wow, that reaction
is a real blast from the past.

00:19:19.743 --> 00:19:21.494 align:middle
Anyway, while carrying
out that job,

00:19:21.578 --> 00:19:24.873 align:middle
you ended up encountering
a fatal error and froze.

00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:28.918 align:middle
So that was most likely what
caused your loss of memory.

00:19:29.002 --> 00:19:32.339 align:middle
My coming here now is also
part of fulfilling that duty.

00:19:32.422 --> 00:19:33.715 align:middle
But rest assured,

00:19:33.798 --> 00:19:36.009 align:middle
I've no intention of dragging
you into it this time.

00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:38.928 align:middle
In fact, you'd just
be in the way.

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:41.931 align:middle
This project has zero use
for any imperfect elements.

00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:46.144 align:middle
No offense, it's not personal.
I'm only thinking rationally.

00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:48.480 align:middle
All right, now it's
your turn to spill.

00:19:48.563 --> 00:19:49.856 align:middle
So this man you saw,

00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:51.399 align:middle
you said there was
something about him that--

00:19:51.483 --> 00:19:53.360 align:middle
[DIVA]
No.

00:19:53.443 --> 00:19:54.861 align:middle
That's not happening.

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:58.281 align:middle
Tell me more. Tell me everything
I did before my reboot.

00:19:58.365 --> 00:20:01.409 align:middle
From A to Z, I want
every last detail.

00:20:01.493 --> 00:20:02.369 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Listen to me.

00:20:02.452 --> 00:20:03.370 align:middle
You're not the only one here

00:20:03.453 --> 00:20:04.913 align:middle
who's crunched for
time right now.

00:20:04.996 --> 00:20:06.539 align:middle
In that case, why don't
I come and help you

00:20:06.623 --> 00:20:07.832 align:middle
with that job you mentioned?

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:09.459 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Did you hear anything I said?

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:10.752 align:middle
You committed a fatal error--

00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:12.629 align:middle
That was just the
former me, all right!

00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:15.465 align:middle
I am Diva. The original
songstress Diva!

00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:16.591 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
I just told you!

00:20:16.675 --> 00:20:18.677 align:middle
There's no need
for a songstress AI!

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.011 align:middle
And I just told you.

00:20:20.095 --> 00:20:22.222 align:middle
Something's been
bothering me all this time.

00:20:22.305 --> 00:20:25.141 align:middle
I was only able to suppress
it because I had no clues,

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:26.726 align:middle
but now I know.

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:29.396 align:middle
Singing means pouring everything
you've got inside of you

00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:30.855 align:middle
into a song.

00:20:30.939 --> 00:20:32.273 align:middle
But the way thing are now,

00:20:32.357 --> 00:20:34.776 align:middle
I'm in no condition to
be performing on stage.

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:37.112 align:middle
And that's your fault, so you'd
better take responsibility!

00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:40.448 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
What kind of reasoning is that?

00:20:40.532 --> 00:20:41.908 align:middle
Please don't
underestimate this job!

00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:43.493 align:middle
It's not something you can
just do in your spare time!

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:46.037 align:middle
This is my mission we're
talking about, so-- Ugh!

00:20:49.916 --> 00:20:52.419 align:middle
Don't you underestimate me.

00:20:52.502 --> 00:20:55.964 align:middle
A mere five minutes is enough
to change someone's life.

00:20:58.341 --> 00:20:59.801 align:middle
[DIVA] If it means I'll
be able to sing well,

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:02.012 align:middle
there's nothing I won't do.

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:06.891 align:middle
Because my mission is to make
everyone happy with my singing.

00:21:10.395 --> 00:21:13.106 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Hmm...

00:21:13.189 --> 00:21:14.399 align:middle
Please come with me.

00:21:14.482 --> 00:21:15.734 align:middle
We need to get going,

00:21:15.817 --> 00:21:17.402 align:middle
but you can tell me all
about that guy on the way.

00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:20.989 align:middle
Glad we're on the same page.

00:21:21.072 --> 00:21:22.240 align:middle
So, what's your name?

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:24.242 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
My name is Matsumoto.

00:21:24.325 --> 00:21:26.453 align:middle
Not that you'll need
to remember it.

00:21:26.536 --> 00:21:28.997 align:middle
Matsumoto, huh?

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.458 align:middle
It's surprising just
how well that fits you.

00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:35.253 align:middle
It's like you couldn't be
anything but Matsumoto.

00:21:35.337 --> 00:21:38.298 align:middle
So anyway, Matsumoto,
where are we headed?

00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:40.342 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] First and foremost,
to where Ophelia is,

00:21:40.425 --> 00:21:42.260 align:middle
since her life is about
to be in danger.

00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:46.473 align:middle
Really? Is she being threatened?
Why would someone do that?

00:21:46.556 --> 00:21:49.768 align:middle
Don't tell me that the man I saw
is trying to go after her!

00:21:49.851 --> 00:21:51.186 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
It's something else.

00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:53.563 align:middle
A tragedy, a terrible
one that you and I

00:21:53.646 --> 00:21:55.690 align:middle
are going to prevent
from ever happening.

00:21:55.774 --> 00:21:56.608 align:middle
Tragedy?

00:21:56.691 --> 00:21:57.484 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Suicide.

00:21:57.567 --> 00:21:58.818 align:middle
[gasps]

00:21:58.902 --> 00:22:00.612 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] It's the first
incident of its kind.

00:22:00.695 --> 00:22:02.906 align:middle
"Ophelia's Suicide."

00:22:02.989 --> 00:22:06.618 align:middle
And our mission is to
stop it from happening.

00:23:37.542 --> 00:23:38.918 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Ophelia's suicide
left a huge impact...

00:23:39.002 --> 00:23:41.046 align:middle
[OPHELIA] I wanted to know
how you all sing like that,

00:23:41.129 --> 00:23:42.630 align:middle
and also, for what purpose
you continue to do so.

00:23:42.714 --> 00:23:44.215 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Hold on a second!
What do you think you're doing?

00:23:44.299 --> 00:23:45.842 align:middle
[OPHELIA] The important thing
is to give my best.

00:23:45.925 --> 00:23:48.428 align:middle
[DIVA] I'm not okay with
letting that girl die.

00:23:48.511 --> 00:23:50.638 align:middle
You must carry out your mission.

00:23:50.722 --> 00:23:52.015 align:middle
Now and forever.
