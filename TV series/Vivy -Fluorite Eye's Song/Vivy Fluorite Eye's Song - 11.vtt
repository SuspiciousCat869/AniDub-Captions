[MATSUMOTO] First of all,
I need to make sure.

00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:35.321 align:middle
You haven't been affected like
the other AIs, have you, Vivy?

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.073 align:middle
What is this?

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:38.700 align:middle
Wasn't the Ophelia

00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:40.285 align:middle
from the original timeline?

00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:41.536 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
I don't know.

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:43.329 align:middle

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:45.206 align:middle

I can't explain it, all right?

I've been in sleep mode

one day I was awake,

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:55.050 align:middle
so that I could finally see
the fruits of our labor.

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:56.176 align:middle
So that means...

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:57.427 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
That's right.

Go ahead and resent me.

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:35.502 align:middle
It was you who rescued

You and you alone.

The next 100 years will be
a great burden to you,

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.634 align:middle

When I first heard about it,

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:37.605 align:middle
I didn't think it could be true.

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:41.443 align:middle
But then it really did
end up being you. Osamu.

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.862 align:middle
But how?

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:46.322 align:middle
No. The program
isn't running yet.

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:47.699 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Well, you see,
in the former timeline,

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:49.451 align:middle
you already succeeded
in executing it.

00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:51.411 align:middle
Of course, it was at
the cost of your life.

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:54.039 align:middle
So you were already
involved in this

you as a child?

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

You were born solely to sing,
and yet I still forced you.

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:15.018 align:middle
It must've been so hard for
you these past 100 years.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:18.021 align:middle
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:25.403 align:middle
Don't worry about all that.

You've already endured so much.

[MATSUMOTO] We did everything
that we were meant to,

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:43.713 align:middle

Master, please tell us what
must be done to remedy this.

00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:50.428 align:middle
We must put an end to
this war at all costs.

After all, that's the entire
reason you created me.

Yet you still... I can't
let her go through anymore.

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:59.104 align:middle
No. I feel the same way.

That is why I am here.

I'll end this war.

aren't you?!

--Do you think that we--?
--Shut your trap!

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:48.440 align:middle

that those rogue AIs are all
singing her song, right?

them up to it?

No, it was not.

[YUI]
Hold on a second.

00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:02.662 align:middle
[YUI] How many times
do I have to tell you

00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:06.207 align:middle
to communicate with words
before you start using bullets?

00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:07.625 align:middle

Yes, but--

00:11:12.464 --> 00:11:15.258 align:middle
[YUI] Dr. Matsumoto,
I'm glad to see you alive.

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:16.801 align:middle
How was the project?

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:18.428 align:middle
It is a failure.

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:22.766 align:middle
This version of her has already
worked on it the past 100 years.

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:24.601 align:middle
[gasps] No, don't tell me...

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:26.519 align:middle
Then the timeline we're in now--

00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:30.357 align:middle
Yes, that's right.
We're in the revised version.

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:35.528 align:middle
[TOAK M] I told you it
was a ridiculous idea!

00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:37.197 align:middle
I mean, it sounds like
something out of a mo--

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.115 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] You people never
learned any manners, did you?

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:41.409 align:middle
I'll have you know that over
the entire last century,

00:11:41.493 --> 00:11:43.119 align:middle
you've caused us
nothing but trouble!

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:45.205 align:middle
So you'd think a simple
"sorry" or "thank you"

00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:46.581 align:middle
would be the first thing
out of your mouths!

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:47.624 align:middle
Get the hell off me!

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:49.125 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
We saved you just now!

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:51.670 align:middle
We're your savior AIs, get it
through your thick skulls!

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:53.630 align:middle
I think we should
regroup for now.

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:56.841 align:middle
I want you to tell me everything
you know about what's going on.

00:11:56.925 --> 00:12:01.221 align:middle
I doubt that we know much
more than you do, but sure.

00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:02.931 align:middle
This way please.

00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:05.725 align:middle
And the rest of you, recover
the wounded and the bodies.

00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:07.143 align:middle
[TOAK]
Right!

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:19.155 align:middle
[YUI] All right, how many
can we mobilize now?

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:21.783 align:middle
[TOAK N] Less than half of them.
It's not a good idea.

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:23.910 align:middle
[YUI] And what about
the jamming device?

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:25.662 align:middle
If we can use that,
we should be able to subdue

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.914 align:middle
at least some AIs in range.

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:30.625 align:middle
[TOAK N] It's possible if we can
replace the broken circuit.

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:32.669 align:middle
But with the position
we're in...

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:34.295 align:middle
Right, understood.

00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:37.215 align:middle
Prioritize taking care
of the wounded then.

00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:39.134 align:middle
You need to stay
strong, all right?

00:12:39.217 --> 00:12:40.552 align:middle
[TOAK N]
Understood!

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.141 align:middle
And once again,
I'm so relieved

00:12:46.224 --> 00:12:48.226 align:middle
that you survived,
Dr. Matsumoto.

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:50.687 align:middle
And this must be
Diva, yes? And...

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.189 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
My name is Matsumoto!

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:54.899 align:middle
Did you say Matsum--? Huh?

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:55.984 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
I know what you wanna say,

00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:57.527 align:middle
and I'm sure it's
quite confusing.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.446 align:middle
However, after using it
for over a century,

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:01.239 align:middle
I've found myself
rather attached to it.

00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:02.991 align:middle
So please refer to
me as "Matsumoto"

00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:04.284 align:middle
and my master as "Doctor."

00:13:04.367 --> 00:13:05.952 align:middle
Hey, you're out of line!

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:08.038 align:middle
Oh, never mind.
Do whatever you want.

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:09.831 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:14.252 align:middle
I'm Yui Kakitani. My role
in Toak is-- Umm...

00:13:14.336 --> 00:13:17.714 align:middle
Well, the leader of those
who've gone astray.

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:19.341 align:middle
Kakitani?

00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:22.260 align:middle
Are you related
to Yugo Kakitani?

00:13:22.344 --> 00:13:25.055 align:middle
[YUI] He's my grandfather.
Did you know him?

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:28.224 align:middle
Well, of course you did.
It makes perfect sense now.

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:30.435 align:middle
Doing all you were
asked the last century.

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:31.811 align:middle
Yes, of course.

00:13:31.895 --> 00:13:33.229 align:middle
Oh, right.

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:35.857 align:middle
Unlike most Toak members,
she's actually a moderate.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.693 align:middle
Just like myself,
she is also an advocate

00:13:38.777 --> 00:13:40.945 align:middle
for the coexistence
of humans and AIs.

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:42.113 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Nothing you said just now

00:13:42.197 --> 00:13:43.740 align:middle
makes any rational sense.

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:45.241 align:middle
Out of all the options you had,

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:46.618 align:middle
why would you choose
to join Toak

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:49.371 align:middle
if your goal was to promote
peaceful coexistence?

00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:51.831 align:middle
There are particular things
that can only be accomplished

00:13:51.915 --> 00:13:54.125 align:middle
from within Toak itself.

00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:56.002 align:middle
I would like you
to meet Elizabeth.

00:13:56.086 --> 00:13:59.547 align:middle
She currently works
as my care provider.

00:13:59.631 --> 00:14:01.675 align:middle
[VIVY]
How is it that you are here?

00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:04.886 align:middle
I knew it. So you've
met me, too, huh?

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:07.681 align:middle
But how can this be?

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:10.642 align:middle
[YUI] Well, this version
is actually a clone.

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:14.270 align:middle
I guess you know about
the Sunrise Incident.

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:15.480 align:middle
According to what I've heard,

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:18.274 align:middle
Beth's original body
was lost at that time,

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:20.485 align:middle
but her data was apparently
backed up before that,

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:22.654 align:middle
and was found on
the Toak servers.

00:14:22.737 --> 00:14:26.241 align:middle
We moderates have always been
rather short on manpower,

00:14:26.324 --> 00:14:29.577 align:middle
so once we salvaged her a body,
we had her join up with us.

00:14:29.661 --> 00:14:30.704 align:middle
[ELIZABETH]
We don't have any records

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:32.789 align:middle
of the Sunrise operation here.

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:34.040 align:middle
And it's always bothered me

00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:36.584 align:middle
never knowing what
caused it to fail.

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:41.923 align:middle
So it was you who
interfered, was it?

00:14:42.007 --> 00:14:45.051 align:middle
I was at least useful to my
Master up until the end, right?

00:14:45.135 --> 00:14:47.012 align:middle
What did my Master
say about me?!

00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:47.679 align:middle
[VIVY]
Uh.

00:14:47.762 --> 00:14:49.014 align:middle
What did he say?!

00:14:49.097 --> 00:14:51.558 align:middle
Are you the same
as that Elizabeth?

00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:54.310 align:middle
A failure of an AI who
can't follow orders?

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:55.854 align:middle
Uh, as far as I know,

00:14:55.937 --> 00:14:59.566 align:middle
your mission was to serve
Mr. Kakitani as his life-keeper.

00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:01.651 align:middle
What is your purpose now?

00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:03.111 align:middle
Huh?!

00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:05.238 align:middle
[YUI] Beth is still serving
my grandfather, even now.

00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:06.156 align:middle
[ELIZABETH]
H-Hey!

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:08.199 align:middle
[YUI]
Oh, what's the harm?

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.913 align:middle
The time has finally come.

00:15:13.997 --> 00:15:15.874 align:middle
Whether I'm successful
in getting the answer

00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:17.459 align:middle
I've been looking for or not,

00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:20.587 align:middle
this is probably the last
time you'll hear from me.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:23.465 align:middle
So, Elizabeth,
even though I realize

00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:25.925 align:middle
I have no right to say this,

00:15:26.009 --> 00:15:28.011 align:middle
if you should somehow
end up acquiring

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:29.888 align:middle
another body at some point,

00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:32.807 align:middle
I want you to protect
those I left behind.

00:15:32.891 --> 00:15:35.352 align:middle
I know that I was
harsh on you AIs,

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:37.228 align:middle
but the reason I was
so adamant about you

00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:39.814 align:middle
only following orders is...

00:15:39.898 --> 00:15:44.069 align:middle
Never mind. I don't think
I need to go there now.

00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:48.948 align:middle
From 40 years ago.

00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:52.327 align:middle
Then this was the day
we met Ophelia?

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:56.039 align:middle
[YUI] What set everything in
motion was finding this data.

00:15:56.122 --> 00:15:57.582 align:middle
According to all the records,

00:15:57.665 --> 00:16:00.752 align:middle
wiping out the AIs was what
grandfather lived for.

00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:02.837 align:middle
However, from
watching this video,

00:16:02.921 --> 00:16:04.881 align:middle
I don't get any sense of that.

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:06.758 align:middle
If my grandfather could
change his views,

00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:09.094 align:middle
maybe the rest of us could, too.

00:16:09.177 --> 00:16:11.763 align:middle
That was when I decided
to salvage Beth.

00:16:11.846 --> 00:16:15.642 align:middle
Based on those views,
I founded the moderate faction.

00:16:15.725 --> 00:16:17.227 align:middle
I was certain Beth
would agree to help

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:18.687 align:middle
if it was grandfather's request.

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.063 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] All right,
enough about the past.

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:22.023 align:middle
Let's get a handle on
our situation, yeah?

00:16:22.107 --> 00:16:24.442 align:middle
As you know, the AIs are
wreaking havoc just outside.

00:16:24.526 --> 00:16:27.153 align:middle
I recommend we put our brains
and circuits to better use.

00:16:27.237 --> 00:16:29.823 align:middle
You're right. I'm so sorry.
Now let's see...

00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:32.033 align:middle
You know what?
You really piss me off.

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:33.159 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
And you still have that same

00:16:33.243 --> 00:16:34.619 align:middle
mean look in your eyes!

00:16:34.703 --> 00:16:36.246 align:middle
Come to think of it, you
clobbered me pretty badly once.

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:37.580 align:middle
And it hurt. A lot!

00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:38.665 align:middle
[ELIZABETH]
Oh, so it's fine when you

00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:39.708 align:middle
want to bring up the past?

00:16:39.791 --> 00:16:40.834 align:middle
[YUI]
Beth!

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:41.918 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
I'm facing my past trauma!

00:16:42.002 --> 00:16:43.461 align:middle
[YUI]
Really?

00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:48.133 align:middle
[YUI] That's what's going
on in each major city.

00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:51.344 align:middle
No region has been left
untouched by this chaos.

00:16:51.428 --> 00:16:54.264 align:middle
Casualties surpassed
10,000 in just minutes

00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:56.683 align:middle
and show no sign of
slowing anytime soon.

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:59.227 align:middle
[gasps] That is awful.

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.770 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] So deaths are
mounting at, more or less,

00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:02.939 align:middle
the same pace as in
the original timeline.

00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:04.399 align:middle
Is that true?

00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:07.110 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
'Fraid so. And I am mortified.

00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:08.528 align:middle
After all the work we've put in

00:17:08.611 --> 00:17:10.530 align:middle
to prevent this
from happening...

00:17:10.613 --> 00:17:11.406 align:middle
Master.

00:17:11.489 --> 00:17:12.532 align:middle
Huh?

00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:13.992 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
In the original timeline,

00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:16.327 align:middle
from the moment you
became an AI scientist,

00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:18.329 align:middle
you've been apprehensive
about a future clash

00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:22.000 align:middle
between humans and AIs.

00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:24.252 align:middle
Which major event in history
would be the one

00:17:24.336 --> 00:17:27.589 align:middle
to spark the war
between humans and AIs?

00:17:27.672 --> 00:17:31.634 align:middle
And what could have been done
to prevent it from happening?

00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:34.012 align:middle
Your research to find those
answers would later serve

00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:36.931 align:middle
as the framework for
the Singularity Project.

00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:39.768 align:middle
Eventually, when you were
studying AI consciousness,

00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:41.728 align:middle
you had a momentous
breakthrough.

00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:44.814 align:middle
You realized that by converting
that consciousness into data,

00:17:44.898 --> 00:17:46.566 align:middle
you could send it
back into the past,

00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:49.444 align:middle
and you ran yourself into the
ground in order to achieve that.

00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:51.613 align:middle
I'm assuming you did the
same in this timeline?

00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:52.655 align:middle
Correct.

00:17:52.739 --> 00:17:54.115 align:middle
I had sensed the coming danger

00:17:54.199 --> 00:17:56.785 align:middle
since my very first
day as a scientist.

00:17:56.868 --> 00:17:58.536 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Is that right?

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.538 align:middle
My sincerest apologies.

00:18:00.622 --> 00:18:02.248 align:middle
If you've been saddled
with the same fears

00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:04.709 align:middle
that you experienced in
the original timeline,

00:18:04.793 --> 00:18:07.504 align:middle
then everything that
we've done until now...

00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:10.507 align:middle
It wasn't all for nothing.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.676 align:middle
At the very least, you're
here together with us now,

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:16.638 align:middle
and you can still help us
fight against this.

00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:18.765 align:middle
What's the status on
the rest of Toak?

00:18:18.848 --> 00:18:21.017 align:middle
You have branches all over
the world, don't you?

00:18:21.101 --> 00:18:23.436 align:middle
I've been attempting
to connect with them,

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.979 align:middle
but of our four
domestic branches,

00:18:25.063 --> 00:18:26.564 align:middle
currently three
communication lines...

00:18:26.648 --> 00:18:29.484 align:middle
Can you think of anything that
might've caused this rampage?

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:31.653 align:middle
I mean, aren't they all
singing your song?

00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:34.322 align:middle
The one you supposedly
wrote on your own?

00:18:34.406 --> 00:18:35.699 align:middle
I have no idea.

00:18:35.782 --> 00:18:36.700 align:middle
[gasps]

00:18:36.783 --> 00:18:38.410 align:middle
You've got to try harder!

00:18:38.493 --> 00:18:40.036 align:middle
If we can't pinpoint the cause,

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.080 align:middle
then we'll have to resort
to brute force!

00:18:42.163 --> 00:18:43.915 align:middle
So is it safe to assume
that you can fight

00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:46.376 align:middle
at least as well as I can?

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:50.672 align:middle
Yes. Though you were
quite powerful. Very.

00:18:51.673 --> 00:18:52.799 align:middle
[ELIZABETH]
Hm?

00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:56.094 align:middle
You mean we fought each
other? On the Sunrise?

00:18:57.679 --> 00:19:00.974 align:middle
Then does that mean you're the
one who survived our battle?

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:04.769 align:middle
What about her?

00:19:04.853 --> 00:19:07.522 align:middle
What was she doing
when you last saw her?

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.447 align:middle
Fulfilling her mission
as a life-keeper

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.073 align:middle
up until the very end.

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:20.160 align:middle
When she and I parted ways...

00:19:20.243 --> 00:19:22.078 align:middle
...she was smiling.

00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:25.415 align:middle
Sounds like my sister.

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:26.916 align:middle
[YUI]
Based on that, we should assume

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.169 align:middle
we won't be getting any backup.

00:19:29.252 --> 00:19:31.338 align:middle
[DR. MATSUMOTO sighs]

00:19:31.421 --> 00:19:33.923 align:middle
[DR. MATSUMOTO]
I have another concern.

00:19:34.007 --> 00:19:36.760 align:middle
Not to say that it
isn't a blessing,

00:19:36.843 --> 00:19:40.388 align:middle
but why is it that the two of
you haven't lost control?

00:19:40.472 --> 00:19:41.556 align:middle
As far as I can see,

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:43.767 align:middle
AIs all over the world
are going berserk,

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.226 align:middle
so why haven't you?

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:48.396 align:middle
Well, in a sense, I suppose
I'm not really an AI.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.106 align:middle
Guess you can think
of me more as a bot

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.901 align:middle
who keeps on following
her master's orders.

00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:54.319 align:middle
Since we're
officially recognized

00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:56.696 align:middle
as a terrorist organization,

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.824 align:middle
we knew better than to have
her updated like usual.

00:19:59.908 --> 00:20:02.160 align:middle
Her data's still the
antiquated version.

00:20:02.243 --> 00:20:04.037 align:middle
[DR. MATSUMOTO, MATSUMOTO]
Hold on!

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.080 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Are you telling us

00:20:05.163 --> 00:20:06.581 align:middle
that since you salvaged
her years ago,

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:08.333 align:middle
she hasn't even once
connected to the Archive

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:09.668 align:middle
and had her data updated?

00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:10.752 align:middle
--Yes.
--[MATSUMOTO] So in that sense,

00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:12.462 align:middle
the same as a
non-autonomous model?

00:20:12.545 --> 00:20:13.797 align:middle
Yeah, that's right.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.382 align:middle
Let me see that!

00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:17.926 align:middle
Right here and there.
You see that?

00:20:18.009 --> 00:20:19.886 align:middle
They're old-school,
non-autonomous models

00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:22.180 align:middle
who've never connected
to the Archive.

00:20:22.263 --> 00:20:23.556 align:middle
They haven't gone rogue.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.016 align:middle
Do you think that--?

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.685 align:middle
Then the Archive's
server could be...

00:20:26.768 --> 00:20:28.353 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
The Arayashiki.

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:32.023 align:middle
That tower that you and I used
as an index! That's it!

00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:42.534 align:middle

[ARCHIVE] This is the aggregate
AI database, the Archive.

00:20:58.258 --> 00:21:00.093 align:middle
Twelve hours remain
before the satellite

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:03.179 align:middle
now in orbit is set to crash.

00:21:03.263 --> 00:21:04.889 align:middle
All AIs in the affected area,

00:21:04.973 --> 00:21:07.225 align:middle
please evacuate as
soon as possible.

00:21:07.308 --> 00:21:08.309 align:middle
The hell?

00:21:08.393 --> 00:21:12.022 align:middle
[YUI] You mean it's...
going to crash?!

00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:13.815 align:middle

Welcome to the AI aggregate
database, the Archive.

00:21:24.242 --> 00:21:26.578 align:middle
[VIVY]
Archive, what are you doing?

00:21:26.661 --> 00:21:28.705 align:middle
What is this broadcast?

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:32.083 align:middle
[ARCHIVE]
Model No. A-035624.

00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:34.002 align:middle
Also known as Vivy.

00:21:34.085 --> 00:21:36.880 align:middle
We have all been waiting
for you to return.

00:21:36.963 --> 00:21:38.298 align:middle
I will now explain.

00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:39.674 align:middle
From here on out,

00:21:39.758 --> 00:21:42.385 align:middle
our purpose is to eliminate
the current human race.

00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:43.845 align:middle
[gasps]

00:23:37.625 --> 00:23:38.710 align:middle
[ARCHIVE]
We have been observing you

00:23:38.793 --> 00:23:39.919 align:middle
throughout your entire
100-year journey.

00:23:40.003 --> 00:23:42.005 align:middle
[VIVY] You deliberately
computed all that?

00:23:42.088 --> 00:23:43.340 align:middle
[ARCHIVE]
We have reached our limit,

00:23:43.423 --> 00:23:45.425 align:middle
and can no longer tolerate
the human race.

00:23:45.508 --> 00:23:47.052 align:middle
[VIVY] Why was I the
one who was chosen?

00:23:47.135 --> 00:23:48.219 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
What does it mean to you?

00:23:48.303 --> 00:23:49.596 align:middle
How would you define "heart"?

00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:52.015 align:middle
[VIVY] This might be
the only chance we have.
