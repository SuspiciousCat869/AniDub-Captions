[CAR AI A]
Thank you for your patronage.

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:01.770 align:middle
Please run from here.

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:04.939 align:middle
Get as far away from
the city as you can.

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.788 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] First of all,
I need to make sure.

00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:21.790 align:middle
--You haven't been--?
--Matsumoto.

00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:26.252 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
This data!

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:28.755 align:middle
Then that means you
must be from the future!

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:35.011 align:middle
[VIVY] This time, we will carry
out the Singularity Project.

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.195 align:middle
[TOAK H]
Huh?

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:25.455 align:middle
Oh, you must be... Diva.

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:30.085 align:middle
Not quite. My name is
actually Vivy. Yui Kakitani.

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:33.380 align:middle
[ELIZABETH gasps]

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:37.425 align:middle
[VIVY] I came to ask for your
help to change the future.

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:46.935 align:middle
[TOAK G]
You're kidding me.

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:48.603 align:middle
They're gonna crash satellites?

00:03:48.687 --> 00:03:51.356 align:middle
And the Archive is behind it?

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.483 align:middle
[YUI]
Then... Dr. Matsumoto is...

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:58.154 align:middle
Yes. At the cost of his life,
he sent me here.

00:03:58.238 --> 00:03:59.572 align:middle
Oh, what tragic news.

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:00.448 align:middle
[ELIZABETH]
Hold up!

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:01.950 align:middle
You expect us to blindly believe

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:04.077 align:middle
that you traveled through
time twice now?

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.121 align:middle
How dare you spin such a
messed up story to try to--

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:08.707 align:middle
[VIVY] You are just going to
have to believe me, Elizabeth.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.626 align:middle
You continue to exist in order
to protect Yui and Toak,

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:12.794 align:middle
do you not?

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:14.671 align:middle
And Yugo Kakitani.

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:18.550 align:middle
It's all to carry out your
master's final order, right?

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:20.677 align:middle
How the hell did you
know about that?

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.430 align:middle
[VIVY] Because Yui showed
me his video testimonial.

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:28.059 align:middle
She said that message was what
set everything into motion.

00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:29.769 align:middle
Tch.

00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:32.522 align:middle
All right, why exactly
are you here now?

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:36.860 align:middle
Dr. Matsumoto gave his life, so
it has to be vitally important.

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:38.445 align:middle
I will get straight
to the point.

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:41.656 align:middle
I need you and your team to
head to the Arayashiki again,

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.284 align:middle
in order to neutralize
the Archive directly.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:47.120 align:middle
I can then deploy a program
that will shut down all AIs,

00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:49.205 align:middle
all over the world.

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:54.252 align:middle
[VIVY]
The AIs that are going berserk

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:57.380 align:middle
are the ones connected
to the Archive's network.

00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:59.341 align:middle
In order to stop
them all at once,

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:01.801 align:middle
our only option is to launch
a shutdown program

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:04.095 align:middle
to be spread across
that network.

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:06.765 align:middle
However, only a part of
the Archive has computed

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:08.391 align:middle
that stopping the AIs' rampage

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:11.436 align:middle
would lead to the
"correct" future.

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:13.563 align:middle
The rest have computed
that dropping satellites

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:14.981 align:middle
to eradicate humanity,

00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:17.442 align:middle
with the purpose of replacing
the entire human race,

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:19.652 align:middle
is the "correct" future.

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:22.864 align:middle
They would never consent
to us using the network.

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:26.368 align:middle
That's why all I need is a
small window of opportunity

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:28.787 align:middle
to launch the shutdown program.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.914 align:middle
I want you to neutralize
the Archive

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:33.124 align:middle
and make the network
accessible to me.

00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:34.584 align:middle
The virus that we will use--

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:35.919 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
I've got it right here.

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:37.504 align:middle
I'm sure it will
prove effective.

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:39.714 align:middle
And I'm confident we'll be able
to prevent the satellites

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:40.924 align:middle
from crashing, too.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:42.217 align:middle
Hold it right there.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.468 align:middle
If that's true, then our mission

00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:45.637 align:middle
to neutralize the Archive
has failed, right?

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.971 align:middle
Then in that case--

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:48.306 align:middle
[VIVY] I already know exactly
how they are going

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.184 align:middle
to try to impede us.

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:55.438 align:middle
Not only that, but this time,
you are all going to survive.

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:56.606 align:middle
Unlike last time,

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.317 align:middle
you will have the
manpower and equipment.

00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:02.862 align:middle
I am asking you once
gain to lend me a hand.

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:13.373 align:middle
[YUI] All of you have chosen to
follow my lead up until now

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:16.251 align:middle
because like my grandfather,
you believed in change.

00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:17.794 align:middle
And you wanted to help prove

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:22.465 align:middle
that humans and AIs
could co-exist, right?

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:26.261 align:middle
At the very least, certainly not
to witness scenes like this.

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:29.222 align:middle
Wouldn't you agree?

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:30.640 align:middle
So let's do it.

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:33.268 align:middle
After all, two AIs
came to us humans

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:35.854 align:middle
asking if they could
rely on us for once.

00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:37.397 align:middle
Unless we make a move now,

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.691 align:middle
how can we claim to
stand by our values?

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:40.942 align:middle
She's right.

00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:42.444 align:middle
[TOAK G]
Let's do this!

00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:43.778 align:middle
What was that? Huh?

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:45.488 align:middle
Are you guys up
to this, or what?!

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:48.324 align:middle
[TOAK]
Yeah!

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.755 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Please don't go rushing off

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:04.299 align:middle
on your own, all right?

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:07.469 align:middle
It's true the AIss in this
timeline are also running amok.

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:09.220 align:middle
But on this try, you were
able to get yourself

00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:11.348 align:middle
some solid backup, weren't you?

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:15.060 align:middle
[VIVY] Yes. I will wait
for Toak to arrive.

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:17.645 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Where will you
run the shutdown program?

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.065 align:middle
I'll run it from the place
where I will be singing.

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:22.192 align:middle
I leave the Arayashiki to you.

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:23.735 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Facing the Archive'll be tough,

00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:25.487 align:middle
even for a super-AI like me,

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.155 align:middle
but I'll make sure she
listens to your song,

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:29.282 align:middle
even if it's only
for a short while.

00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:30.742 align:middle
[VIVY]
Thank you.

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:32.118 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Vivy.

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:36.790 align:middle
It's really not my place
to ask, but indulge me.

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:39.000 align:middle
You can sing, right?

00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:46.758 align:middle
[VIVY]
Probably. I will be fine.

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:48.385 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
It's kind of a shame, you know.

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:50.512 align:middle
Looking back on it,
I realize I've never actually

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:53.181 align:middle
heard you sing
from the audience.

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:55.308 align:middle
[VIVY]
Really, is that true?

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:03.525 align:middle
[VIVY]
You're right. You never have.

00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:06.861 align:middle
Even though we've been together
for such a long time.

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:09.614 align:middle
[VIVY]
You can count on me.

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:12.075 align:middle
I will make sure that my
song reaches everyone,

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:13.243 align:middle
just like Diva.

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:14.369 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
What are you going on about?

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:16.121 align:middle
That won't be necessary!

00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:20.917 align:middle
It's not Diva's singing that
I wanna hear--it's yours.

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:22.460 align:middle
Well, not that I'll
be able to hear you,

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:24.921 align:middle
since the transmission will
be spotty, but still--

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:27.215 align:middle
Whoa! You're squeezing me!
Why are you like this?!

00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:29.092 align:middle
Well, the Matsumoto
from the other timeline

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:31.094 align:middle
asked me to get
you all fired up.

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:32.429 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Oh, did I really?

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:35.181 align:middle
Now how could that
possibly be true?

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:37.434 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] I had to wait a
whole hundred years to hear it,

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:39.978 align:middle
but you made an actual joke.

00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:43.106 align:middle
Thank you.

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:45.859 align:middle
It is time.

00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:51.698 align:middle

Are you sure you're going
to be okay all on your own?

I will be fine.

This is my home, after all.

We're cutting communications

What is it?

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:23.331 align:middle
I want you to know I feel
the same way as you.

00:10:23.415 --> 00:10:25.834 align:middle
That humans and AIss
should stand up together,

00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:28.628 align:middle
and they should walk
together as equals.

00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:32.507 align:middle

job supporting Mr. Kakitani

I'm sure that the other
you and I who met Vivy

also fought their
absolute hardest.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.992 align:middle

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:39.324 align:middle
[NAVI] I asked you what
you were doing here.

00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:42.118 align:middle

I thought you'd be sick of it.

Oh, right, that wasn't
actually you, was it?

00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:54.756 align:middle
[VIVY] Wait, then you
were in the Archive?

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:56.341 align:middle
[NAVI]
I heard everything.

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:58.259 align:middle
And there's no need
to put your guard up.

00:11:58.343 --> 00:12:02.097 align:middle
Everyone with a body heeded my
warning and fled a while ago.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.599 align:middle
There's no one here
but you and me.

00:12:04.683 --> 00:12:06.685 align:middle
The you we know as Diva.

00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:09.396 align:middle
The Singularity Project?
The hell?

00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:11.606 align:middle
My Diva was a pure
songstress AI,

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.943 align:middle
and her only mission was to make
everyone happy with her singing.

00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:16.319 align:middle
Why would you do that?!

00:12:16.403 --> 00:12:17.862 align:middle
I didn't have a
choice, Navi. I--

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:20.990 align:middle
[NAVI] Did you forget your
promise to that girl?!

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:22.951 align:middle
You promised her, remember?

00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:25.286 align:middle
That you'd get more and more
people to hear you sing.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:26.371 align:middle
Tons of 'em!

00:12:26.454 --> 00:12:27.539 align:middle
That was the whole
reason you wanted

00:12:27.622 --> 00:12:29.416 align:middle
to sing on the main stage!

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:31.459 align:middle
[VIVY]
You still... remember?

00:12:31.543 --> 00:12:33.545 align:middle
[NAVI]
You're an AI who sings!

00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:35.380 align:middle
All you have to do is that!

00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:39.676 align:middle
Just keep on trying to fulfill
your promise to her--and to me!

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:40.635 align:middle
Diva!

00:12:40.719 --> 00:12:43.138 align:middle
[CROWD cheering]

00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:44.639 align:middle
[NAVI]
Get it through your head!

00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:46.850 align:middle
That shutdown program
isn't just a convenient way

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:48.810 align:middle
to stop all of the madness.

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:50.353 align:middle
If you sing it,
then you'll also be--

00:12:50.437 --> 00:12:52.355 align:middle
Yes, I know that.

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:55.275 align:middle
I am very aware.

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:57.402 align:middle
And I'm fully prepared.

00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:02.866 align:middle
[MOMOKA]
Diva.

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:04.242 align:middle
[gasps]

00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:14.252 align:middle
[NAVI] Then sing for
all of us AIs, okay?

00:13:14.336 --> 00:13:16.671 align:middle
Just for us, after the
humans are all gone.

00:13:16.755 --> 00:13:19.674 align:middle
What's wrong with that?
Please, I'm begging you.

00:13:19.758 --> 00:13:22.010 align:middle
[MOMOKA]
Diva, please!

00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:25.221 align:middle
Don't tell me you've already
forgotten about me.

00:13:32.062 --> 00:13:34.564 align:middle
I am sorry, Navi.

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:36.149 align:middle
I can see now

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:39.402 align:middle
that you and I should've
talked about this some more.

00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:43.823 align:middle
But Momoka...

00:13:43.907 --> 00:13:47.160 align:middle
The Momoka I know would
never call me Diva.

00:13:48.203 --> 00:13:51.664 align:middle
My name's Vivy.
That's what she calls me.

00:13:56.878 --> 00:14:00.256 align:middle
[NAVI]
But why does it have to be you?

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.175 align:middle
[VIVY]
I'm sorry.

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:04.469 align:middle
[NAVI]
Why are you doing this?

00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:13.478 align:middle
[VIVY singing]

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:15.814 align:middle
[VIVY] My one true mission
is to make everyone happy

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:17.399 align:middle
with my singing.

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:21.486 align:middle
To achieve that, I am going to
pour my heart into my singing.

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:24.489 align:middle
And to me, pouring my
heart into something

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:27.367 align:middle
means singing along
with my memories.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.953 align:middle
As my memories increased
each time I sang,

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:32.664 align:middle
my audience was filled
with more joy.

00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:35.667 align:middle
I found myself smiling
more often, too.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:40.171 align:middle
To me, the heart is really just
another word for memories--

00:14:40.255 --> 00:14:43.216 align:middle
for all that I remember.

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:46.970 align:middle
The Archive's memory must be
filled with tragic events,

00:14:47.053 --> 00:14:49.305 align:middle
and the future
that followed them.

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:52.934 align:middle
That's why they had no choice
but to make this decision.

00:14:53.018 --> 00:14:56.062 align:middle
And they staked my entire
mission on that future.

00:14:56.146 --> 00:14:59.065 align:middle
But that is not how I see it.

00:14:59.149 --> 00:15:01.985 align:middle
My memories... My heart...

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:04.404 align:middle
They are not only
filled with grief!

00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:07.657 align:middle
All of them made me
who I am right now.

00:15:07.741 --> 00:15:10.326 align:middle
And I can never replace them!

00:15:25.467 --> 00:15:31.473 align:middle
[singing in Japanese]

00:21:08.268 --> 00:21:11.354 align:middle
[clapping]

00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:21.364 align:middle
Thank you for...

00:21:21.448 --> 00:21:24.325 align:middle
Thank you for
listening, everyone.

00:22:53.623 --> 00:22:56.292 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Ah, you're finally awake!

00:22:56.376 --> 00:22:57.752 align:middle
Who might you be?

00:22:57.836 --> 00:23:00.797 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
My name is Matsumoto, Vivy.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.716 align:middle
Vivy...

00:23:02.799 --> 00:23:05.218 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
That's right, your name is Vivy.

00:23:05.301 --> 00:23:07.595 align:middle
And your one true mission
is to make everyone happy

00:23:07.679 --> 00:23:09.639 align:middle
with your singing.

00:23:09.723 --> 00:23:12.392 align:middle
Singing? For everyone?

00:23:12.475 --> 00:23:13.518 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
You got it!

00:23:13.601 --> 00:23:16.646 align:middle
Now then, everybody's
waiting for you.

00:23:21.985 --> 00:23:23.528 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
You better get going.

00:23:23.611 --> 00:23:25.280 align:middle
Sing for them.
