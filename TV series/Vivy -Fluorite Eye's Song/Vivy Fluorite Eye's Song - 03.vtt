00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:19.602 align:middle
[CONTROL A]
Come in, Sunrise!

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:22.856 align:middle
This is the Control Center.
Come in, stat!

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.234 align:middle
Can you hear me, bridge?
Respond at once!

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.731 align:middle
[VIVY] Thank you! Thank you
for listening, everyone.

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:43.997 align:middle
[VIVY] Nothing abnormal
detected, then?

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.708 align:middle
[DOCTOR A] No. Would you
like to look for yourself?

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.965 align:middle
I'm glad that you've
started coming in

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.468 align:middle
for maintenance on your own.

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.014 align:middle
What's this here?

00:03:01.097 --> 00:03:03.600 align:middle
It seems like your shows are
getting some good reviews.

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:04.809 align:middle
Excuse me.

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:07.020 align:middle
How would you define
what "heart" is, doctor?

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:08.521 align:middle
[DOCTOR A]
Hm?

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:12.233 align:middle
My one true mission is to
make everyone happy by singing,

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:13.485 align:middle
and to accomplish that,

00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:16.029 align:middle
I am striving to sing
with all of my heart.

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:19.407 align:middle
My goal is to one day
stand on the main stage.

00:03:19.491 --> 00:03:21.618 align:middle
Well, having such
a wonderful voice

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.161 align:middle
is what makes you who you are.

00:03:23.244 --> 00:03:25.663 align:middle
After all, that was how
you were designed.

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:30.251 align:middle
But the problem is, when
people talk about the heart,

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:33.505 align:middle
it's more wordplay
than anything.

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:37.384 align:middle
The heart refers to emotion.
It's the mind and the soul.

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:40.387 align:middle
Not something today's
science can define.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.805 align:middle
Think of it this way,

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.807 align:middle
what exactly does "putting
your heart into something"

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.810 align:middle
mean to you personally?

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:51.231 align:middle
Someday, when you've decided on
an answer, I'd like to hear it.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:54.359 align:middle
[NAVI]
Good work today!

00:03:54.442 --> 00:03:56.486 align:middle
And to you, too.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.239 align:middle
Navi, what does "putting
your heart into something"

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:00.323 align:middle
mean to you?

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:01.866 align:middle
[NAVI]
Huh? What are you talkin' about?

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.576 align:middle
Are your circuits okay?

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.953 align:middle
[VIVY]
I am being serious.

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:06.871 align:middle
[NAVI]
And I'm answering seriously!

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:09.541 align:middle
Haven't I told you before?
There's no room for a heart in--

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:11.459 align:middle
Wait a second.

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:13.878 align:middle
Where is that stuffed animal?

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:16.965 align:middle
[NAVI] Stuffed animal?
Huh? Don't ask me.

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:20.719 align:middle
It's not like I can move
it around or anything.

00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:22.429 align:middle
[VIVY]
What's wrong?

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:25.140 align:middle
[thud]

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:27.517 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
I had her take a little nap.

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:32.063 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] I figured
she'd only get in the way

00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:34.816 align:middle
of our emotional reunion.

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:38.194 align:middle
Would you like to shower,
too, before our hug?

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:39.612 align:middle
You know, I'd really
appreciate it

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:41.614 align:middle
if you could wash off this
body from time to time.

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:43.992 align:middle
It's crazy itchy!

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:45.452 align:middle
Matsumoto.

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:46.953 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Hello, long time no see!

00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:48.747 align:middle
It's been, what, 15 years?

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.956 align:middle
Well, look at that!

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.332 align:middle
I think I see a glimmer
of expression there!

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:52.834 align:middle
What a surprise.

00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:53.877 align:middle
There we go.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.045 align:middle
Speaking of surprises,

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:56.755 align:middle
I see you're commanding
a larger audience.

00:04:56.838 --> 00:05:00.050 align:middle
For what reason, I don't know,
but congratulations!

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.926 align:middle
[VIVY]
Where were you all this time?

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.636 align:middle
Exactly why have you returned?

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.221 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] What do you
mean after all this time?

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.891 align:middle
Do I need to remind you that
this is a 100-year-long project?

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:10.268 align:middle
I admit that I've been asleep
for the past 15 years,

00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:11.644 align:middle
but that was to keep
me from interfering

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:14.230 align:middle
with history, ya know?

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.191 align:middle
That's why I secretly brought
you into the repair shop

00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:17.901 align:middle
and fixed up your body for you.

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:19.361 align:middle
You would've startled
everyone in NiaLand

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:21.863 align:middle
if you'd gone back and
showed up in shambles.

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:36.294 align:middle
Now, then, after 15
years of silence,

00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:38.004 align:middle
we're about to reach a
new singularity point!

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:38.880 align:middle
Are you ready to go?

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:40.465 align:middle
You have got to be joking.

00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:42.384 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] What are you
bein' so huffy about?

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:43.843 align:middle
The two of us stopped
the Naming Law

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:45.470 align:middle
from being passed, remember?

00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:48.390 align:middle
[VIVY] Yes. It is true that the
Naming Law failed to pass.

00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:51.976 align:middle
However, in its place, a new
law was put into effect.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.729 align:middle
A law seen as even more
favorable towards AIs

00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:56.731 align:middle
than the Naming Law.

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:58.316 align:middle
Over the past 15 years,

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.403 align:middle
AIs have increased in
number and evolved.

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:02.737 align:middle
It's not as you described.

00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:04.864 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] The AIs' evolution
is to be expected.

00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:07.200 align:middle
You can't change a river's
flow with one pebble.

00:06:07.283 --> 00:06:10.036 align:middle
As for the new law, it just
so happens that you yourself

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.664 align:middle
are partly to blame
for its success.

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:16.960 align:middle
[AIKAWA] I was still young
and inexperienced then,

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:18.461 align:middle
but I realized
something important

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:20.672 align:middle
when those terrorists
were coming after me.

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:23.174 align:middle
That, as humans, it's not
about how long we live,

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:25.468 align:middle
but rather what we do
with the time we have.

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:26.553 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Are you listening, Diva?

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:27.971 align:middle
In human jargon,

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.015 align:middle
this is what one would call
a real pain in the butt.

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:33.184 align:middle
This man's totally been
influenced by you! It's obvious!

00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:34.686 align:middle
[REPORTER A] ...but this
measure aims to expand

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:36.646 align:middle
on the rights given to AIs...

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.398 align:middle
I'm sure you have something
to say about that.

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:40.191 align:middle
I'd like to give him a
piece of my mind myself,

00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:41.151 align:middle
but we need to get going.

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:42.152 align:middle
[VIVY]
I refuse.

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:43.028 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Hm?

00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:44.237 align:middle
Now, please, remove yourself.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.739 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Oh, boy, there you go again!

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:47.824 align:middle
We already shook
on it, remember?

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:50.452 align:middle
If that is the case, then...

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.748 align:middle
...why did Momoka have to--?

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.583 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Is that what
you're all upset about?

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:58.585 align:middle
Her death was an accident,
plain and simple.

00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:00.879 align:middle
It's not like she was
sacrificed for the project.

00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:03.089 align:middle
That said, if you don't continue
with the project now,

00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:05.759 align:middle
there will be casualties.

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:07.719 align:middle
Far more than there
were 15 years ago

00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:12.265 align:middle
when just a single assemblyman's
life was at stake.

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:16.853 align:middle
You wanna protect the venue
you sing at, don't you?

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:19.230 align:middle
What're you gonna do now, Diva?

00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:24.861 align:middle
You are quite despicable.

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:26.154 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Say what you will!

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:27.322 align:middle
Either way, it's not like
you have any choice

00:07:27.405 --> 00:07:28.531 align:middle
but to work with me.

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:32.118 align:middle
After all, this time
we'll be takin' on...

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:33.745 align:middle
This!

00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:37.999 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Space! Yep, that's right!

00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:42.796 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] To humankind,
outer space had always seemed

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:44.631 align:middle
so far off in the distance.

00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:46.424 align:middle
But with advances
in AI technology,

00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:49.427 align:middle
their dreams of reaching
it became tangible.

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:56.184 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
The AIs impressive abilities

00:07:56.267 --> 00:08:00.522 align:middle
had given space development
a dramatic boost.

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.732 align:middle
Leading the charge was
the tourism industry,

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:05.735 align:middle
its longing eyes fixed on
the boundless galaxies.

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:10.073 align:middle
In other words,
they built space hotels!

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:13.076 align:middle
A sky full of glittering stars,
as well as genuine,

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:16.830 align:middle
unparalleled hospitality,
can now be yours!

00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:25.964 align:middle
[STAFF] We're delighted to have
you here. Welcome to Sunrise!

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:35.557 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
That's the end of my excerpts

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.184 align:middle
from the Space Tourism
Corporation's promo video.

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:40.353 align:middle
How intriguing, yet at the
same time frustrating,

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:43.565 align:middle
the ideas these humans
come up with!

00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:45.692 align:middle
[VIVY] Thank you for
making the trip here.

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:47.819 align:middle
Allow me to take
your luggage for you.

00:08:47.902 --> 00:08:50.530 align:middle
[HOTEL GUEST A] Thanks.
I'll just leave this here then.

00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:52.073 align:middle
Yes.

00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:55.452 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Over the next two days,

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:58.288 align:middle
you will be working here as
a temporary staff member.

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:00.749 align:middle
I had to alter your
profile a bit, so, yeah,

00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:02.334 align:middle
I put your name down as Vivy.

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:03.668 align:middle
And don't worry,

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:05.045 align:middle
I made sure you'd only be
assigned menial work,

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:07.380 align:middle
so even an AI designed to
be a songstress like you

00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:09.507 align:middle
will be able to handle it
without any problems.

00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:12.218 align:middle
See? Nobody back there
recognized you at all, did they?

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:13.595 align:middle
Though come to think
of it, that might be

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:16.097 align:middle
because you're just not
that big of a deal.

00:09:16.181 --> 00:09:17.599 align:middle
[VIVY]
If I may--

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:19.476 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Well, well! Look
who's finally talkin' to me.

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:20.477 align:middle
What is it?

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.978 align:middle
[VIVY]
This will be the last time.

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:24.105 align:middle
Please do not involve
me from now on.

00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:26.066 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Not exactly gung-ho, are you?

00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:28.526 align:middle
And yet your hospitality
skills are impeccable.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.528 align:middle
[VIVY]
Because work is work.

00:09:30.612 --> 00:09:33.114 align:middle
[ESTELLA]
Vivy. Thank you for your help.

00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:34.657 align:middle
Did you run into
any kind of trouble

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:37.077 align:middle
while welcoming the guests?

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.579 align:middle
No. Once I'm done
transporting these,

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:41.581 align:middle
I will return to guest services.

00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:42.832 align:middle
Sorry to have you do this,

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:44.876 align:middle
but food and water
are so precious.

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:46.878 align:middle
Rather than leaving it
to the transport bots,

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:49.547 align:middle
we or the human staff have
to handle it ourselves.

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:51.132 align:middle
Of course.

00:09:55.387 --> 00:09:57.305 align:middle
Let's see.

00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:59.641 align:middle
Still feelings a
little stiff, maybe?

00:09:59.724 --> 00:10:01.976 align:middle
This is the first time some
guests have traveled to space

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.230 align:middle
and they can be quite nervous.

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:09.442 align:middle
Set your smile a bit bigger
than usual, all right?

00:10:10.485 --> 00:10:11.695 align:middle
Yes. Understood.

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:13.905 align:middle
Great. Well done!

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:17.409 align:middle
Oh, I have to go now.

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:20.412 align:middle
And don't forget,

00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:22.080 align:middle
there's no need to
be so formal with us.

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:24.958 align:middle
You can think of the staff
here as one big family.

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:27.002 align:middle
[VIVY]
Got it, Estella.

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:28.128 align:middle
[giggles]

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:31.840 align:middle
And I think your
voice is beautiful.

00:10:31.923 --> 00:10:32.882 align:middle
So is yours.

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:34.009 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
These hospitality AIs

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:35.552 align:middle
sure do know how to communicate.

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:37.554 align:middle
You should consider smiling
outside your stage program

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.139 align:middle
once in a while.

00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:40.432 align:middle
And your speech patterns are so
stiff. You don't need to be--

00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:42.892 align:middle
[VIVY] Is she really who
you told me she is?

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:44.477 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO sighs]

00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:46.146 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
That's right.

00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:47.856 align:middle
She's the owner of
Space Hotel Sunrise,

00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:50.525 align:middle
and also a part of the series
known as "the Sisters."

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:52.861 align:middle
[VIVY] The Sisters...
I have heard of them.

00:10:52.944 --> 00:10:54.988 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] That model's main
feature is its gorgeous voice.

00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:56.614 align:middle
The direct successor
to your model.

00:10:56.698 --> 00:10:57.449 align:middle
So basically...

00:10:57.532 --> 00:10:59.200 align:middle
...she is my younger sister.

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:00.618 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Yes. Exactly.

00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:03.747 align:middle
And as the one who crashed
the Sunrise into Earth...

00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:11.921 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Causing scores of fatalities,

00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:15.800 align:middle
she's also the most grievously
defective AI in history.

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:21.389 align:middle
[ARCHIVE]
Normal access has been detected.

00:11:21.473 --> 00:11:25.894 align:middle
Welcome to the AI aggregate
database, the Archive.

00:11:33.068 --> 00:11:34.110 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Here's some footage of that day

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:36.237 align:middle
from the International
Space Station.

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:37.906 align:middle
Over four-fifths
of its total mass

00:11:37.989 --> 00:11:39.407 align:middle
was incinerated
in the atmosphere,

00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:41.826 align:middle
but the rest of the
structure fell to Earth.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.328 align:middle
Fortunately,
it landed in the ocean,

00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:45.288 align:middle
but all of the guests who didn't
make it out of the hotel

00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:46.581 align:middle
ended up perishing.

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:48.375 align:middle
This incident dealt
a crushing blow

00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:50.377 align:middle
to the AIs standing in society.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.295 align:middle
In terms of preventing
their excessive evolution,

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:53.922 align:middle
it wasn't such a bad thing.

00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:55.882 align:middle
But it triggered widespread
mistrust of AIs

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:57.967 align:middle
since the hotel was
under their control.

00:11:58.051 --> 00:11:59.511 align:middle
And, I mean, there could've
been an unprecedented

00:11:59.594 --> 00:12:01.638 align:middle
number of deaths had
it fallen elsewhere.

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:03.890 align:middle
The anti-AI sentiment
escalated quickly

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:05.100 align:middle
into violence and destruction

00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:06.643 align:middle
and created the perfect
breeding ground

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:08.478 align:middle
for groups like Toak
to run amok.

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:10.939 align:middle
This sparked the future war
between AIs and humans

00:12:11.022 --> 00:12:12.315 align:middle
in a significant way.

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:13.441 align:middle
And there's your brief summary

00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:15.235 align:middle
of the Space Hotel
Sunrise Crash,

00:12:15.318 --> 00:12:17.654 align:middle
AKA: the Sun-Crash Incident.

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:18.780 align:middle
[VIVY]
Then our next priority

00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:20.699 align:middle
is to prevent the
hotel from crashing?

00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:21.950 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Correct!

00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:23.618 align:middle
And the fastest and most
logical course of action

00:12:23.702 --> 00:12:25.453 align:middle
would be to destroy Estella.

00:12:25.537 --> 00:12:26.663 align:middle
[VIVY]
Why is that?

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:28.206 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Because the records collected

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:29.874 align:middle
by the control tower on the
ground confirm it was Estella

00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.960 align:middle
who caused the hotel to
crash down to Earth.

00:12:32.043 --> 00:12:33.336 align:middle
The only one who
has the authority

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.715 align:middle
to alter the hotel's trajectory
is the owner, Estella.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.010 align:middle
[sighs]

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:41.177 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Compared to last time,

00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:42.846 align:middle
the objective couldn't
be more clear-cut.

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:44.848 align:middle
If Estella's functioning,
the Sunrise will crash,

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:46.057 align:middle
so we need to destroy her.

00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:47.350 align:middle
What's your problem with that?

00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:49.019 align:middle
[VIVY]
It is too simplistic.

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:52.313 align:middle
Is there a chance she was hacked
or went rogue due to a virus?

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:53.898 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
It doesn't matter.

00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:55.817 align:middle
Either way, she's still the one
who pulled the final trigger.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.361 align:middle
[VIVY] But we do have time
to at least ascertain that.

00:12:58.445 --> 00:12:59.362 align:middle
And it would bring chaos--

00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:00.905 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Vivy, do you realize

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:02.824 align:middle
what's at stake here
for this mission?

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:04.617 align:middle
You're not making any
needless calculations

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:06.411 align:middle
just because she's
your sister, are you?

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:07.829 align:middle
Besides, didn't you
two just meet?

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:10.331 align:middle
And anyway, you may call
her your younger sister...

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:12.000 align:middle
[LECLERC]
Vivy? Vivy!

00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:13.585 align:middle
[VIVY]
I've been summoned. Goodbye.

00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:16.588 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Huh? But I haven't
finished making my point yet!

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:20.133 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO grumbles]

00:13:22.177 --> 00:13:25.096 align:middle
[KIDS laughing]

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:29.434 align:middle
[LECLERC]
Vivy! Hey! Your feet! Remember?

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:37.233 align:middle
[LECLERC]
And don't forget to smile!

00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:38.777 align:middle
[VIVY]
Yes, I'm sorry.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.195 align:middle
[LECLERC]
Hang in there, okay?

00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:42.238 align:middle
A lot of kids get
over-excited at this event

00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:44.324 align:middle
and end up getting injured.

00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:49.120 align:middle
Are you okay? Be careful now.

00:13:49.204 --> 00:13:51.039 align:middle
[ESTELLA, GIRL A laugh]

00:13:51.122 --> 00:13:52.749 align:middle
[VIVY]
She seems used to this.

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:53.958 align:middle
[LECLERC]
Well, yeah.

00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:57.295 align:middle
It's been seven years,
I think. Same as me.

00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:01.591 align:middle
[giggles]

00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:05.261 align:middle
All right. Please grab on to
the floor rails everyone!

00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:07.305 align:middle
[KIDS]
Okay!

00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:10.183 align:middle
[VIVY] Ms. Leclerc, have you
known Estella long?

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:21.444 align:middle
[laughing]

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:23.655 align:middle
Is so much laughing necessary?

00:14:23.738 --> 00:14:25.240 align:middle
[LECLERC]
Sorry, sorry!

00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:27.033 align:middle
Excuse me, Ms. Leclerc, uh--

00:14:27.117 --> 00:14:30.370 align:middle
[LECLERC]
Uh-uh-uh. Just Leclerc!

00:14:30.453 --> 00:14:33.206 align:middle
All right, Leclerc. Have you
known Estella very long?

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:34.374 align:middle
[LECLERC]
I guess so!

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:36.835 align:middle
We've been working
together all this time.

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:42.590 align:middle
Everyone working here is
just like one big family.

00:14:42.674 --> 00:14:45.093 align:middle
That is the same thing
that I heard Estella say.

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:48.054 align:middle
You're really curious
about her, aren't you?

00:14:56.354 --> 00:14:57.856 align:middle
I'll warn you now,
you're better off

00:14:57.939 --> 00:15:00.650 align:middle
not getting more involved
with her than you have to.

00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:02.736 align:middle
Why? What exactly
do you mean by that?

00:15:02.819 --> 00:15:04.863 align:middle
Have you heard all
of the rumors?

00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:06.406 align:middle
You've heard them, haven't you?

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:09.075 align:middle
That Estella took over this
hotel from its previous owner,

00:15:09.159 --> 00:15:11.828 align:middle
and that she was
involved in his death?

00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:17.000 align:middle
Thank you for your hard work!

00:15:57.874 --> 00:15:59.417 align:middle
[door opens]

00:16:01.086 --> 00:16:03.004 align:middle
Please, do not
startle me like that.

00:16:03.088 --> 00:16:05.131 align:middle
It's your own fault for
cutting off our call.

00:16:05.215 --> 00:16:06.508 align:middle
Our conversation isn't over.

00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:07.634 align:middle
How did you get in here?

00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:09.719 align:middle
I thought you were
in the cargo bay.

00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:12.847 align:middle
What do you think you're
doing right now?

00:16:12.931 --> 00:16:15.100 align:middle
I am searching for more
information on Estella.

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:16.267 align:middle
We don't have time for that!

00:16:16.351 --> 00:16:18.561 align:middle
Listen, 23 hours and
27 minutes from now,

00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:20.105 align:middle
this hotel is going to fall.

00:16:20.188 --> 00:16:21.147 align:middle
We need to stop--

00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:22.816 align:middle
[VIVY]
I would like solid evidence.

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:25.068 align:middle
I am going to search her
room while she's away.

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:27.612 align:middle
--So stay put while I--
--[door opens]

00:16:27.696 --> 00:16:30.198 align:middle
Oh, Vivy.

00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:32.951 align:middle
What's going on? You're on
your break now, aren't you?

00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:35.370 align:middle
Why are you in my
room? What's this?

00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:37.080 align:middle
I would like to ask
you something.

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:38.456 align:middle
That little stuffed animal

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.834 align:middle
is something that
a guest left behind.

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:42.168 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
There's nothing we need to ask.

00:16:42.252 --> 00:16:43.753 align:middle
Luckily, no one
will see us here.

00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:45.005 align:middle
[VIVY]
Please wait.

00:16:45.088 --> 00:16:46.548 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] I will use
a virus to reformat her,

00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:47.799 align:middle
and you dispose of the body.

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:49.634 align:middle
[VIVY]
I said, please wait!

00:16:49.718 --> 00:16:51.302 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO grunts]

00:16:52.429 --> 00:16:53.847 align:middle
No! Please stop that!

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle
You shouldn't handle a guest's
personal item so roughly!

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:58.435 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Ouch.

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:00.270 align:middle
What are you doing? I thought my
stuffing was going to come out!

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:01.980 align:middle
You can't even hold
a bear properly?

00:17:02.063 --> 00:17:04.024 align:middle
Here's how you do it, first
place your hand on its rear--

00:17:04.107 --> 00:17:06.401 align:middle
Yeah! Like that! Take a look.
You could learn something!

00:17:06.484 --> 00:17:08.028 align:middle
Isn't that sweet? I've been...

00:17:08.111 --> 00:17:11.406 align:middle
Estella, can you tell me
about this picture?

00:17:11.489 --> 00:17:12.907 align:middle
[ESTELLA]
Hm? Oh, this?

00:17:12.991 --> 00:17:15.160 align:middle
It's a photo of
Sunrise's opening day.

00:17:15.243 --> 00:17:17.662 align:middle
It's been about
seven years already.

00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:19.706 align:middle
[VIVY]
This man was the previous owner?

00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:21.082 align:middle
[ESTELLA]
Yes.

00:17:21.166 --> 00:17:22.792 align:middle
He was in an accident while
performing a spacewalk.

00:17:22.876 --> 00:17:24.502 align:middle
The owner's policy
was for all of us

00:17:24.586 --> 00:17:26.504 align:middle
to be willing to
take on any task.

00:17:26.588 --> 00:17:29.007 align:middle
He cherished the values
from over a century ago,

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:32.093 align:middle
and he treated his business
more like a family.

00:17:35.638 --> 00:17:37.515 align:middle
What do you think...

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:39.392 align:middle
...about space?

00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:43.229 align:middle
Your eye cameras
are showing stats

00:17:43.313 --> 00:17:45.857 align:middle
for gamma rays and cosmic
radiation, right?

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.233 align:middle
[VIVY gasps]

00:17:47.317 --> 00:17:48.693 align:middle
[ESTELLA] You're calculating
whether it's dangerous

00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:50.195 align:middle
based on those stats.

00:17:50.278 --> 00:17:53.948 align:middle
But even without them, humans
are aware of it, you know.

00:17:54.032 --> 00:17:57.035 align:middle
When humans experience outer
space for the first time,

00:17:57.118 --> 00:17:59.496 align:middle
they're overwhelmed with awe.

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.706 align:middle
All thoughts of danger
and beauty vanish

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:04.209 align:middle
as it stops them
in their tracks.

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:06.336 align:middle
The late owner used to say
that was something

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:09.881 align:middle
only the cosmos could do.

00:18:09.964 --> 00:18:11.633 align:middle
After the owner passed away,

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:14.302 align:middle
I asked his family
for their permission

00:18:14.386 --> 00:18:17.555 align:middle
to please let me keep
the hotel going.

00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:20.684 align:middle
Since I was manufactured with
a caretaker AI's mission,

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:22.769 align:middle
it shouldn't matter
where I work.

00:18:22.852 --> 00:18:27.607 align:middle
But regardless... I don't intend
on leaving this place.

00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:30.193 align:middle
See, I just love
this space hotel.

00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:32.404 align:middle
The Sunrise has my heart!

00:18:32.487 --> 00:18:34.989 align:middle
Estella, what does "putting
your heart into something"

00:18:35.073 --> 00:18:38.076 align:middle
mean to you personally?

00:18:38.159 --> 00:18:40.078 align:middle
Like the phrase in the
hotel's commercial.

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:43.540 align:middle
When they spoke of "genuine,
unparalleled hospitality."

00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:45.291 align:middle
Let me see...

00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:47.210 align:middle
Well, we want our guests
to feel comfortable

00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:49.504 align:middle
and enjoy themselves, you know?

00:18:49.587 --> 00:18:52.090 align:middle
That's why I'm always smiling.

00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:54.509 align:middle
Of course, it's also part
of my job to smile.

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:56.261 align:middle
And also...

00:18:57.762 --> 00:19:00.724 align:middle
...because I made
a precious promise.

00:19:00.807 --> 00:19:02.267 align:middle
Listen to me.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.769 align:middle
An AI talking about matters of
the heart, isn't that funny?

00:19:04.853 --> 00:19:06.521 align:middle
[laughs]

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.107 align:middle
[VIVY]
Not to me.

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:12.819 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Ouchie.

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:17.490 align:middle
Vivy?

00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:23.121 align:middle
[VIVY] Not to me. I find it
a lovely to think that way.

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:29.836 align:middle
[alarm blaring]

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:31.546 align:middle
What's that?

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.884 align:middle
[KENJI] Hey, isn't that
the ship's alarm?

00:19:35.967 --> 00:19:38.511 align:middle
Shouldn't we be worrying
about this? What's going on?

00:19:38.595 --> 00:19:39.888 align:middle
[HOTEL GUEST B]
An accident?

00:19:39.971 --> 00:19:41.556 align:middle
Do you think we're
gonna be safe?

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:42.432 align:middle
[VIVY]
Matsumoto.

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:43.933 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
There's no way.

00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:46.394 align:middle
I told you that it's going to
happen 23 hours from now.

00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:53.068 align:middle
[ESTELLA]
Attention all staff members,

00:19:53.151 --> 00:19:54.611 align:middle
I've checked the systems.

00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:57.280 align:middle
The alarm was likely triggered
by a security wall malfunction.

00:19:57.364 --> 00:20:01.785 align:middle
Just to be safe, please
recheck all areas visually.

00:20:01.868 --> 00:20:04.746 align:middle
I will take care
of everything here.

00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:07.415 align:middle
Please excuse me, everyone,
may I have your attention?

00:20:07.499 --> 00:20:09.668 align:middle
I'm sure the alarm has
caused some concern.

00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:13.838 align:middle
We have determined it to be the
result of a minor malfunction.

00:20:13.922 --> 00:20:15.715 align:middle
I apologize for the
inconvenience,

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:17.842 align:middle
but we would appreciate it
if you could kindly wait

00:20:17.926 --> 00:20:20.470 align:middle
in this hall for a
little bit longer.

00:20:20.553 --> 00:20:25.517 align:middle
We are truly sorry, and your
cooperation is most appreciated.

00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:32.649 align:middle
Now if you will, please
take a look up above you.

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:36.444 align:middle
I present the constellations
and stars.

00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:39.447 align:middle
[HOTEL GUESTS gasping]

00:20:43.743 --> 00:20:45.245 align:middle
[ESTELLA] What you're seeing
in the center right now

00:20:45.328 --> 00:20:49.916 align:middle
is Arcturus, the star of wheat,
in the constellation Bootes.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.462 align:middle
Again, we welcome you to
the Space Hotel Sunrise.

00:20:54.546 --> 00:20:57.340 align:middle
Please relax and enjoy
your time with the stars

00:20:57.424 --> 00:20:59.801 align:middle
to your heart's content.

00:21:01.928 --> 00:21:07.934 align:middle
[singing in Japanese]

00:21:48.558 --> 00:21:50.894 align:middle
[VIVY]
Matsumoto, are you listening?

00:21:50.977 --> 00:21:52.187 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
I am indeed listening.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.272 align:middle
She's one of the
Sisters, all right.

00:21:54.356 --> 00:21:55.523 align:middle
Choosing music as a way

00:21:55.607 --> 00:21:58.443 align:middle
to help ease her rattled
guests' anxiety, huh?

00:21:58.526 --> 00:22:00.612 align:middle
[VIVY] Estella was not at
all involved in the death

00:22:00.695 --> 00:22:02.155 align:middle
of the previous owner.

00:22:02.238 --> 00:22:03.239 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Probably not.

00:22:03.323 --> 00:22:04.532 align:middle
I've taken a look
at the records

00:22:04.616 --> 00:22:06.785 align:middle
and the owner's death
was purely accidental.

00:22:06.868 --> 00:22:09.120 align:middle
There's no real way that
she could've intervened.

00:22:09.204 --> 00:22:11.790 align:middle
That said, the record of
her crashing the Sunrise

00:22:11.873 --> 00:22:13.541 align:middle
is a completely separate matter.

00:22:13.625 --> 00:22:15.502 align:middle
Do not confuse them.

00:22:21.966 --> 00:22:24.803 align:middle
[VIVY] I cannot believe that she
would ever crash this hotel.

00:22:24.886 --> 00:22:26.012 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Your opinion means nothing

00:22:26.096 --> 00:22:28.848 align:middle
against the invariable
facts of the future.

00:22:28.932 --> 00:22:30.517 align:middle
[YUZUKA]
Diva?

00:22:34.854 --> 00:22:36.064 align:middle
[YUZUKA]
I knew it!

00:22:36.147 --> 00:22:38.775 align:middle
I thought it might
be you, and it was.

00:22:38.858 --> 00:22:39.984 align:middle
[VIVY]
And you are?

00:22:40.068 --> 00:22:43.113 align:middle
[YUZUKA] I'm Yuzuka,
it's nice to meet you!

00:22:44.739 --> 00:22:47.492 align:middle
I'm Momoka Kirishima's
little sister.

00:22:53.998 --> 00:22:55.625 align:middle
[LECLERC]
So you're speeding up the plan?

00:22:55.709 --> 00:22:56.876 align:middle
I think that's wise.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.796 align:middle
Since someone's been
sniffing around here.

00:23:01.715 --> 00:23:04.759 align:middle
I've endured it all
just for this day.

00:23:07.971 --> 00:23:11.850 align:middle
[LECLERC]
Don't let it go to waste, okay?

00:23:11.933 --> 00:23:15.395 align:middle
Now the owner will
finally get justice.

00:23:18.314 --> 00:23:19.566 align:middle
[ESTELLA]
Hold on.

00:23:37.917 --> 00:23:39.669 align:middle
[VIVY]
Estella, why are you doing this?

00:23:39.753 --> 00:23:41.796 align:middle
Matsumoto, the anti-personnel
combat program.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.465 align:middle
I am going to get her home
safely no matter what.

00:23:43.548 --> 00:23:45.884 align:middle
Let us bring this Singularity
Project to fruition.

00:23:45.967 --> 00:23:47.218 align:middle
[ESTELLA]
You mustn't forget.

00:23:47.302 --> 00:23:50.263 align:middle
You and I live for our
missions. We are still AIs.

00:23:50.347 --> 00:23:51.973 align:middle
I'm crashing the Sunrise.
