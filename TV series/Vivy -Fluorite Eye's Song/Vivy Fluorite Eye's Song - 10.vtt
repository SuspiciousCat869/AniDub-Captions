[singing in Japanese]

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:26.568 align:middle
Thank you all!

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:29.112 align:middle
Thank you so much
for listening to me!

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.698 align:middle
[VIVY]
That was from five years ago.

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:33.158 align:middle
As all of you just saw,

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:35.702 align:middle
I have operated until now
to fulfill my mission

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:38.163 align:middle
of making everyone happy
with my singing.

00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:40.498 align:middle
Often on the main
stage at NiaLand.

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:42.417 align:middle
[BOY A] Nialand?
I don't know that place!

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.752 align:middle
Yeah. Me neither!

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:45.712 align:middle
I've been there, but I
don't remember seeing you.

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:49.758 align:middle
Now, now, don't be rude.
She was very famous in her time.

00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:54.679 align:middle
Here at the AI Museum,
we take pride in--

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:57.307 align:middle
[BOY A]
Hey! Sing somethin', will ya?

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.102 align:middle
I am sorry, but that isn't--

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:03.188 align:middle
Aww...

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:05.065 align:middle
Come on, that's asking a lot.

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:07.025 align:middle
We should thank her,
don't cha think?

00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:08.943 align:middle
[KIDS]
Okay...

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:10.445 align:middle
[BOY B]
Bye-bye, Miss.

00:01:10.528 --> 00:01:13.031 align:middle
[TEACHER]
Now, don't wander off, okay?

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:17.035 align:middle
Sixty-six years ago?

00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:24.376 align:middle
[TEACHER]
Osamu!

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:26.795 align:middle
It's time for us to go now!

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.011 align:middle
[MUSEUM AI] The tour program
is now complete.

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:38.765 align:middle
Please return to the specified
coordinates and stand by.

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:06.751 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] That may be the
most painfully woeful face

00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:09.254 align:middle
I've ever seen.

00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:11.006 align:middle
If I didn't know better,
I never would've guessed

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:13.383 align:middle
you were the person
in that video.

00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:46.976 align:middle
[VIVY]
Matsumoto.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.895 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] It is indeed I.
Five years later.

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:50.230 align:middle
Wait, never mind.

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:51.940 align:middle
Forty-five and half years
with you. My mistake.

00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:53.775 align:middle
[VIVY] I've been waiting
for you all this time.

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:55.527 align:middle
What do we need to do next?

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.779 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Hmm? What's goin' on with you?

00:03:57.862 --> 00:03:59.656 align:middle
[VIVY] This is all
that I have left now.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.117 align:middle
I need the Singularity Project.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.745 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] I see,
so that's what this is about.

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.164 align:middle
After a long career,
you finally retired.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:11.001 align:middle
The retirement of the
original songstress AI, Diva.

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:13.545 align:middle
I hear the ceremony was
quite the extravaganza.

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:15.296 align:middle
Although it didn't include
a farewell concert.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.466 align:middle
Suffice it to say, the fans were
less than thrilled about that.

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:23.054 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] It's a shame you
were donated to this AI museum

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:25.390 align:middle
as an exhibit following
your retirement.

00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:26.641 align:middle
Because since then,

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:29.686 align:middle
no one has ever heard
you sing a single note.

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:35.734 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Have you lost
the ability to sing?

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:38.236 align:middle
[AUDIENCE cheering]

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.238 align:middle
[VIVY]
Even now, I'm not sure.

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:42.657 align:middle
How can I pour my heart
into my singing?

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:46.369 align:middle
Even though I'm supposed to make
everyone happy with my voice.

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:52.042 align:middle
[VIVY]
Like Diva did that day.

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.210 align:middle
Once I put that
into perspective,

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:56.546 align:middle
I found myself unable
to sing anymore.

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:57.964 align:middle
That's why the only thing I--

00:04:58.048 --> 00:04:59.591 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] I'm sorry, but I'm
afraid you can no longer

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:01.468 align:middle
work on the Singularity Project.

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:05.180 align:middle
Why not? I am still perfectly
capable! It's only my singing--

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:07.515 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
The reason being,

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.225 align:middle
it turns out the
incident with Ophelia

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:13.605 align:middle
was the final anticipated
singularity point.

00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:17.734 align:middle
Are you familiar with
Ophelia's murder-suicide?

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:19.736 align:middle
[VIVY]
Yes, I am.

00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:23.323 align:middle
[VIVY] Also about the
chaos that followed,

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:25.158 align:middle
when people claimed
that they both had souls

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:26.743 align:middle
the same as humans.

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:27.952 align:middle
How is that different
from the original?

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:29.037 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Not true.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.580 align:middle
Unlike in the original timeline,

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:33.667 align:middle
there weren't any AIs who
followed their example.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.418 align:middle
In hindsight, there's
no denying that it was

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:37.712 align:middle
a positive revision in
terms of the project.

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:40.173 align:middle
Our job correcting the
singularity points is done.

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:42.801 align:middle
[VIVY]
But if that's the case,

00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:45.428 align:middle
then why didn't you
go into sleep mode?

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:49.891 align:middle
It was you who said not
to alter history needlessly.

00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:51.685 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Hmm.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:56.898 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Something Mr. Kakitani said

00:05:56.981 --> 00:05:59.025 align:middle
has been bugging me.

00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:03.154 align:middle
[KAKITANI] I had a revelation.
A revelation from the heavens.

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:04.239 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Not to mention,

00:06:04.322 --> 00:06:06.825 align:middle
I have a personal
favor to fulfill.

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:08.201 align:middle
[VIVY]
What kind of favor?

00:06:08.284 --> 00:06:09.953 align:middle
It's hard to believe you
care about something

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:11.371 align:middle
outside of your mission.

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:12.706 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Who are you to talk?

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.791 align:middle
Singing was your sole devotion,
yet here you are,

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:16.501 align:middle
championing the
Singularity Project,

00:06:16.584 --> 00:06:18.628 align:middle
which you're starting to see
as your linchpin, no less.

00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:20.255 align:middle
Not that there's anything
you can do anymore.

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:23.508 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO laughs]

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:25.135 align:middle
[sighs]

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:27.595 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Would you like
to have a race against me?

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:29.139 align:middle
[VIVY]
What kind of race?

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:30.348 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
To see which one of us

00:06:30.432 --> 00:06:32.517 align:middle
can accomplish their
respective task first.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.352 align:middle
[VIVY]
That does not sound like you.

00:06:34.436 --> 00:06:38.565 align:middle
But I still have no idea what
I must do to find an answer.

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:43.153 align:middle
Even though I know can never
set foot onstage again.

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:45.405 align:middle
"You must sing with
all your heart."

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:48.742 align:middle
Why would my developer
say such a thing to me?

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:50.702 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Well, that's basically something

00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:53.288 align:middle
only your developer will know.

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:55.874 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Vivy?

00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:59.002 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Hmm...

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:01.004 align:middle
Well, you just keep
on pondering, okay?

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:03.256 align:middle
I mean, you've got nothin'
but time after all.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.050 align:middle
I'll pop in again at some
point to check on you.

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:07.052 align:middle
[VIVY]
Come to think of it,

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:10.847 align:middle
why did you choose today
to come visit me?

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.432 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Have you forgotten?

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:14.309 align:middle
Huh?

00:07:14.392 --> 00:07:16.770 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Today is the 65 year anniversary

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:19.105 align:middle
of the day that
you and I first met.

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:22.025 align:middle
The perfect time for
a reunion, right?

00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:27.906 align:middle
[MUSEUM AI] The museum
will be closing soon.

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:30.992 align:middle
We look forward to your
next visit with us.

00:07:41.086 --> 00:07:43.630 align:middle
[ARCHIVE]

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:47.717 align:middle
Welcome to the AI aggregate
database, the Archive.

00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:58.603 align:middle
[VIVY] Is there still any
data from my manufacture

00:07:58.687 --> 00:07:59.896 align:middle
and rollout date?

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:01.856 align:middle
[ARCHIVE]
Yes. Shall I display it now?

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:02.649 align:middle
[VIVY]
Please do.

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:04.234 align:middle
[ARCHIVE]
Understood.

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:06.986 align:middle

June 19, 2060, at 22:01.

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:16.579 align:middle
[DEVELOPER] "Pouring her
heart into her singing"?

00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:17.747 align:middle
But why would you present her

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:20.125 align:middle
with a task as
ambiguous as that?

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:22.585 align:middle
[DEVELOPER A]
Because I'm looking for a clue.

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:25.338 align:middle
Looking for a clue?
But what do you mean?

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:27.173 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:28.383 align:middle
[DEVELOPER A]
To us humans,

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:30.802 align:middle
what exactly does it
mean to have a heart?

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:33.471 align:middle
And as the first
autonomous humanoid AI,

00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:36.141 align:middle
I'm curious as to what
her answer will be.

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:38.268 align:middle
That's what I'm looking
forward to most.

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:39.561 align:middle
[DEVELOPER] But that
has nothing to do with

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:41.604 align:middle
this project's objective at all.

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:44.107 align:middle
I'm not sure that adding a
nebulous term like "heart"

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.275 align:middle
to her computing processes--

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:47.736 align:middle
Try not to worry
about the objective.

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:50.697 align:middle
For instance, even if having
a heart in her own way

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:55.160 align:middle
leads her to resent us, I'd be
satisfied with her answer.

00:08:55.243 --> 00:08:58.079 align:middle
Now then, I'm curious to
see what kind of singing

00:08:58.163 --> 00:09:00.290 align:middle
she's going to treat us to.

00:09:07.422 --> 00:09:08.882 align:middle
[DEVELOPER A]
Let me go over your role.

00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:12.260 align:middle
Your mission is to make
everyone happy by singing.

00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:17.057 align:middle
And to accomplish that, you
must sing with all your heart.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:20.977 align:middle
[OSAMU]
Um... Uh, excuse me.

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:25.148 align:middle
Please forgive me.

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:27.025 align:middle
Is there something
I can assist you with?

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:30.153 align:middle
I-- Well, uh...

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:32.155 align:middle
Your name is Osamu, correct?

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:34.699 align:middle
You were on a field trip
with your class yesterday.

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:36.034 align:middle
But how did you--?

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:38.828 align:middle
I remember your teacher
calling you by that name.

00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:42.415 align:middle
I was wondering,

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:44.751 align:middle
did you retire because you
couldn't sing anymore?

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:46.044 align:middle
[gasps]

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:47.879 align:middle
[VIVY]
Oh, I, uh...

00:09:47.962 --> 00:09:50.757 align:middle
You were the first
songstress AI ever made,

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.468 align:middle
and you were popular,
so why retire?

00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:56.554 align:middle
That was the only real
reason I could think of.

00:09:56.638 --> 00:09:58.765 align:middle
[VIVY] Are you saying,
despite how young you are,

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:00.642 align:middle
you actually know about me?

00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:03.269 align:middle
That's just common sense.

00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:07.148 align:middle
My classmates not knowing you
is what's surprising to me.

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:08.942 align:middle
Well, you are correct.

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:11.653 align:middle
I found that I was unable
to sing anymore,

00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:13.780 align:middle
that's why I'm here.

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:15.115 align:middle
[OSAMU]
Not even one song?

00:10:15.198 --> 00:10:17.659 align:middle
Even though it's your mission?

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:19.619 align:middle
Yes.

00:10:19.703 --> 00:10:24.666 align:middle
Y-Ya know, I really wanted to
hear you sing in person, Diva.

00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:26.793 align:middle
I'm sorry about that.

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:31.047 align:middle
Hey, I know.

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:34.175 align:middle
Osamu, would you like to
have a race against me?

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:35.885 align:middle
A race against you?

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:37.387 align:middle
Sure, why not?

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.056 align:middle
I am searching for the answer
for what it is I must do,

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.726 align:middle
so I'll be able to
sing once again.

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:45.311 align:middle
Do you think I will
find the answer first?

00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:47.731 align:middle
Or will you bring some
friends with you to visit

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:49.566 align:middle
before I have the chance?

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:53.236 align:middle
[gasps] I don't really care
about friends all that much!

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:54.946 align:middle
Yes. I can see that.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.407 align:middle
But will you accept
my challenge anyway?

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.200 align:middle
I think that having
someone to compete against

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:02.454 align:middle
will push me to try even harder.

00:11:02.537 --> 00:11:03.830 align:middle
Well, okay.

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:06.166 align:middle
Wonderful. Thank you.

00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:13.882 align:middle
But, um, even if I
don't bring any friends,

00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:16.092 align:middle
can I still come and visit?

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:17.260 align:middle
Of course you can.

00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:20.221 align:middle
I will look forward
to seeing you again.

00:11:20.305 --> 00:11:21.723 align:middle
[gasps]

00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:40.533 align:middle
[VIVY]
Not even a single song, huh?

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:44.204 align:middle
I used to be able to sing
over a million existing songs.

00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:46.581 align:middle
Could it be more pathetic?

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:49.292 align:middle
Huh?

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:53.838 align:middle
[VIVY]
Archive?

00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:55.340 align:middle
[ARCHIVE]
Yes?

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:57.676 align:middle
[VIVY] Were there any songs
written by AIs in the past?

00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:00.178 align:middle
[ARCHIVE] I have found more
than 100,000 songs.

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:01.346 align:middle
Shall I list them?

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:03.181 align:middle
[VIVY] No. I don't mean
songs that humans

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:05.642 align:middle
had composer AIs or
bots write for them.

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:10.188 align:middle
Are there any that were written
by AIs of their own free will?

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:12.315 align:middle
[ARCHIVE]
No results found.

00:12:14.317 --> 00:12:15.819 align:middle
[VIVY]
I see.

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:23.451 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Been a while, hasn't it?

00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:24.703 align:middle
Huh?

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:28.123 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
So, what are you up to here?

00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:34.963 align:middle
[VIVY] Since I could not find
any existing songs in my drive

00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:36.965 align:middle
that I can sing now,

00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:40.552 align:middle
I thought that if I wrote
one myself, then maybe--

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:42.137 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
What a simple way of thinking!

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.265 align:middle
Don't tell me that's what you've
been doing this whole year.

00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:47.434 align:middle
So, what kinda song is it?

00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:01.823 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
No, no, no! That can't be it!

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:02.991 align:middle
Please tell me there's more.

00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:05.702 align:middle
[VIVY]
Just leave me alone.

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:09.039 align:middle
What this song will be about...
Who I am going to sing it for...

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:10.540 align:middle
I have no idea.

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:11.416 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] So basically,
you're just ramming your head

00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:12.792 align:middle
into a brick wall?

00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:14.336 align:middle
At this rate, there's no
telling when you'll be done.

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:16.129 align:middle
Or whether you'll even be able
to sing it if you do finish it.

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:17.505 align:middle
[VIVY]
And what about you?

00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:20.967 align:middle
You have not taken care
of that favor yet, have you?

00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:22.177 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Well, anyway,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.054 align:middle
I would advise you not
to overdo it, okay?

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:25.055 align:middle
[VIVY]
Impossible.

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:26.306 align:middle
I must try anything
and everything

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:27.891 align:middle
to fulfill my mission.

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:29.225 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Taking such a roundabout route

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:30.727 align:middle
will only get you so far.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.771 align:middle
But I'll drop by again
to check in sometime.

00:13:32.854 --> 00:13:34.606 align:middle
Like next year, maybe.

00:13:34.689 --> 00:13:38.943 align:middle
[VIVY] Right. See you next
year on the day we met.

00:13:57.587 --> 00:14:03.593 align:middle
[inaudible]

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.141 align:middle
[OSAMU]
Diva?

00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:37.354 align:middle
[VIVY]
Osamu?

00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:39.439 align:middle
Were you able to find
your answer yet?

00:15:39.522 --> 00:15:42.567 align:middle
No. Still no progress.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:43.735 align:middle
Oh, I see.

00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:46.237 align:middle
I apologize. I think
I should try harder.

00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:49.532 align:middle
No, it's not that I'm
judging you. Just...

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:51.117 align:middle
It's frustrating that
there isn't anything

00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:53.286 align:middle
I can do to help you.

00:15:54.329 --> 00:15:55.497 align:middle
What is her name?

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.831 align:middle
It's Luna.

00:15:56.915 --> 00:15:59.834 align:middle
And she shares part of her
name with my wife Nana.

00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:00.877 align:middle
[VIVY]
Little Luna.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.253 align:middle
Wanna hold her?

00:16:02.337 --> 00:16:04.047 align:middle
[VIVY]
Are you sure?

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:12.847 align:middle
I just wonder why Nana
was still able to smile...

00:16:12.931 --> 00:16:16.935 align:middle
Surely no one wanted to see this
child grow up more than she did.

00:16:17.018 --> 00:16:18.436 align:middle
[OSAMU]
I don't know.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.232 align:middle
Although she was always
thinking about Luna.

00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:26.152 align:middle
She wanted to see what
path Luna would take.

00:16:26.236 --> 00:16:28.196 align:middle
What would make her
laugh, make her cry,

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:31.366 align:middle
and what kind of people she
might meet on her journey.

00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:38.832 align:middle
You know, Diva, all human
beings die one day.

00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:42.127 align:middle
But even in death, a piece of
them stays behind with us.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:46.172 align:middle
Even now, in my heart,
my wife is still here with me.

00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:47.841 align:middle
[gasps]

00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:53.179 align:middle
[DIVA] All right,
the rest is up to you!

00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:05.275 align:middle
[OSAMU] That's why I'm going
to see it through to the end.

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:10.321 align:middle

Normal access has been detected.

00:17:10.405 --> 00:17:14.451 align:middle
Welcome to the AI aggregate
database, the Archive.

00:18:35.573 --> 00:18:37.283 align:middle
[clapping]

00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:38.493 align:middle
Huh?

00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:40.453 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
This song, it's the embodiment

00:18:40.537 --> 00:18:43.748 align:middle
of the Singularity
Project, isn't it?

00:18:43.832 --> 00:18:45.458 align:middle
[VIVY]
It is.

00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:46.751 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
That explains it.

00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:48.128 align:middle
I don't know what came over me,

00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:51.131 align:middle
but I completely lost myself
while listening to it.

00:18:51.214 --> 00:18:53.717 align:middle
Why choose to write
about the project?

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.052 align:middle
[VIVY] I thought if it was
about the path I have taken,

00:18:56.136 --> 00:18:57.929 align:middle
and who I have met until now,

00:18:58.013 --> 00:19:01.516 align:middle
then I might be able to
come up with a song.

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:04.519 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] So ultimately,
it's a song about yourself then.

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:07.022 align:middle
Who did you write it for though?

00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:10.108 align:middle
[VIVY]
Diva.

00:19:10.191 --> 00:19:13.695 align:middle
Although she is gone now, a part
of her still remains inside me.

00:19:13.778 --> 00:19:16.239 align:middle
She is a part of me.

00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:17.407 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
And what?

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.867 align:middle
You think that this
song will enable you

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.827 align:middle
to sing from your heart?

00:19:21.953 --> 00:19:25.206 align:middle
[VIVY] If I could sing,
I would've sung it already.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:26.416 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Seriously.

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:27.709 align:middle
Still, I have to say,

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:29.461 align:middle
for someone stuck on
a single phrase for years,

00:19:29.544 --> 00:19:32.130 align:middle
you sure cranked it
all out in one go.

00:19:32.213 --> 00:19:34.591 align:middle
Did something trigger
that perhaps?

00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:38.178 align:middle
[VIVY]
She held my fingers.

00:19:38.261 --> 00:19:40.555 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Excuse me?

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:42.807 align:middle
[VIVY] It has been a year,
right, Matsumoto?

00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:44.976 align:middle
Sorry to do this to you
on the day you visited,

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.102 align:middle
but I need a nap.

00:19:46.186 --> 00:19:47.437 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Huh?

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.981 align:middle
[VIVY] I just got really sleepy.
See you next year.

00:19:50.065 --> 00:19:51.316 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Hey!

00:19:53.568 --> 00:19:57.530 align:middle
[VIVY] Do not worry. I will
wake up if any visitors come.

00:19:57.614 --> 00:19:59.407 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] You did just finish
a major part of the task

00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:01.951 align:middle
you've been burdened
with the past 20 years.

00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:03.828 align:middle
It makes sense that
your computing circuits

00:20:03.912 --> 00:20:06.664 align:middle
need a little
downtime after that.

00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:10.085 align:middle
I've fulfilled my
promise to you, Diva.

00:20:10.168 --> 00:20:11.586 align:middle
Well, for the most part.

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.004 align:middle
It's not like Vivy's
sung it yet,

00:20:13.088 --> 00:20:14.756 align:middle
so the inevitable
result of our race

00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:17.175 align:middle
will have to wait
a little longer.

00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:21.221 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Good night, Vivy.

00:20:21.304 --> 00:20:24.557 align:middle
I hope our paths will
cross again someday.

00:20:24.641 --> 00:20:28.478 align:middle
In a bright new future
where there's no war.

00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:35.318 align:middle
[OSAMU]
Diva.

00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:39.864 align:middle
Huh?

00:20:42.492 --> 00:20:44.661 align:middle
Music data.

00:20:55.463 --> 00:20:59.467 align:middle
I see. You've done it.

00:21:00.719 --> 00:21:03.805 align:middle
How wonderful. Great work.

00:21:03.888 --> 00:21:06.307 align:middle
I want you to
take it easy for now.

00:21:06.391 --> 00:21:07.600 align:middle
The next time you wake up,

00:21:07.684 --> 00:21:09.394 align:middle
I'm sure I'll get
to hear your voice.

00:21:09.477 --> 00:21:11.312 align:middle
[RESEARCHER]
Excuse me, Mr. Matsumoto?

00:21:11.396 --> 00:21:13.481 align:middle
[OSAMU]
Right, I'm on my way.

00:22:52.622 --> 00:22:54.040 align:middle
[gasps]

00:23:20.942 --> 00:23:22.736 align:middle
[AIS singing]

00:23:22.819 --> 00:23:24.279 align:middle
[gasps]

00:23:24.362 --> 00:23:30.493 align:middle
[AIS singing]

00:23:46.301 --> 00:23:48.136 align:middle
[VIVY]
Please wait! What's going on?

00:23:48.219 --> 00:23:52.057 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] The Singularity
Project... has ended in failure.
