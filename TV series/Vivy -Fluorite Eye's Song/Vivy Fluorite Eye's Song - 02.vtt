00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.100 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] This is footage
from the news one year from now.

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:19.310 align:middle
Aikawa's death captured
the public's attention,

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:20.770 align:middle
and every year on this date,

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:23.732 align:middle
humans gather to lay flowers
for him, with AIs in tow.

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:25.817 align:middle
So flesh and titanium
alloy bonded,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.571 align:middle
and humans and AIs marched down
the path of prosperity together.

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:31.990 align:middle
And I know it sounds nice,
but that is so not a good thing,

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:36.327 align:middle
so come on--hurry up
and get moving!

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:39.456 align:middle
Oh! It's also important that
you don't get your cover blown.

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.335 align:middle
[gunshot]

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:47.088 align:middle
[TOAK B]
A guard AI?

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:53.303 align:middle
That body needs an upgrade.

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:55.555 align:middle
[BOTH gasp]

00:00:55.638 --> 00:00:56.931 align:middle
[yelps]

00:01:04.606 --> 00:01:05.857 align:middle
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.737 align:middle
[KUWANA]
You ran into a guard AI?

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.907 align:middle
So we must've missed
killing one then.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.076 align:middle
Kakitani, I'll be
heading up myself.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.869 align:middle
I'm counting on you to take
command of your unit

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:20.205 align:middle
as we originally planned
and finish the job.

00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:22.248 align:middle
Do you need some backup, sir?
I can certainly have some of--

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:24.626 align:middle
[KUWANA] We're up against
a guard AI here.

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:27.837 align:middle
You don't have the
experience for that.

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.632 align:middle
So I'm leaving this side to you.

00:01:30.715 --> 00:01:32.425 align:middle
Let's head out!

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:47.899 align:middle
[VIVY]
What is Toak?

00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:50.568 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Basically, they're
a terrorist organization.

00:01:50.652 --> 00:01:54.698 align:middle
A group of AI-haters
harboring anti-AI ideology.

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.282 align:middle
Jeez, they went through
this much trouble

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:58.118 align:middle
in the middle of the night?

00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:04.207 align:middle
What are you?
Are you a guard AI?

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.126 align:middle
Are you able to converse?

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:07.752 align:middle
[VIVY]
Yes, Assemblyman Aikawa.

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:11.464 align:middle
I came to rescue you.
Did you sustain any injuries?

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:14.884 align:middle
I haven't ever seen you.
What department are you with?

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.469 align:middle
Are there any reinforcements?

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:17.762 align:middle
[VIVY]
No, only me.

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:19.347 align:middle
All of the other
AIs in the building

00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:21.141 align:middle
have already been destroyed.

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:23.685 align:middle
Likely by the people
who attacked you.

00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:25.603 align:middle
Shouldn't you call for backup?

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:27.272 align:middle
You can't possibly handle
all this on your own!

00:02:27.355 --> 00:02:28.523 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Hold it right there!

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:30.275 align:middle
Can we save that talk for later?

00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:32.193 align:middle
You see, we're
running out of time.

00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:33.737 align:middle
[yelps]

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.572 align:middle
[VIVY] I wish you would not
emerge. It complicates things.

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:36.781 align:middle
Now please, get off.

00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:38.116 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Don't be so cold!

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:39.868 align:middle
Do you understand how much
it hurts to be left out?

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:42.787 align:middle
[VIVY] Yes, I do.
Please do not mock me.

00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:44.706 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Well, all joking aside,

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:49.544 align:middle
the fact is that we really
are out of time, Diva.

00:02:49.627 --> 00:02:52.088 align:middle
In the future that I know,
Assemblyman Aikawa's body

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:53.715 align:middle
was found right here
under the rubble.

00:02:53.798 --> 00:02:57.635 align:middle
FYI: With very little of his
original form still remaining.

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.012 align:middle
So what are you?

00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:00.305 align:middle
[VIVY]
What do you mean by that?

00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:02.390 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Toak blew this entire place up.

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:05.727 align:middle
Take a good look around you.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.937 align:middle
This happens to be the building
for the AI company

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:10.023 align:middle
where Assemblyman Aikawa
used to work.

00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:12.817 align:middle
For Toak, it was killing
two birds with one stone.

00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:14.194 align:middle
He was able to kill Aikawa

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:17.072 align:middle
and then attack his company's
assets simultaneously.

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:19.866 align:middle
Of course, the ironic thing is
that Assemblyman Aikawa's death

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:21.368 align:middle
ended up serving
as the springboard

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.787 align:middle
that got the Naming Law passed.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:27.040 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
This will be our mission:

00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:29.209 align:middle
Before Toak can make that
a reality, we are to help

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:32.003 align:middle
Assemblyman Aikawa escape
from this building safely.

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:33.296 align:middle
That's all!

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.174 align:middle
We'll use the exit on the
first floor--let's go!

00:03:36.257 --> 00:03:38.843 align:middle
[AIKAWA] Hey, what's the
matter? Did you freeze?

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:40.720 align:middle
And what sort of device
is this thing?

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:41.805 align:middle
[VIVY]
Thank you for your patience.

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.390 align:middle
We need to head
to the first floor.

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:46.059 align:middle
We must reach the exit
before this building collapses.

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:47.560 align:middle
What are you talking about?!

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:51.147 align:middle
Hold on a second.
Stop! You can't just--

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:52.565 align:middle
Huh?

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:05.912 align:middle
[TOAK C]
Uh?

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:08.873 align:middle
[gasps]

00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:12.711 align:middle
[TOAK D]
Damn you!

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.969 align:middle
You're spending way
too much time on one!

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:27.350 align:middle
[TOAK D yelling]

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:31.146 align:middle
[AIKAWA]
Are you really sure we're okay?

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.398 align:middle
You don't seem like you're
very experienced to me.

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:36.234 align:middle
I am. But I appreciate
all of your concern.

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:37.861 align:middle
What? No! That's not
what I meant by--

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:40.155 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
I apologize for the intrusion.

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:49.039 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO grunts]

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.290 align:middle
Huh?

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:52.125 align:middle
[VIVY] Please do not
take such liberties.

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:53.543 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
What was that for?

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:54.627 align:middle
Are you worried about
how it might

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:56.546 align:middle
affect your singing function?

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.340 align:middle
[VIVY] Of course I am.
After all, I was--

00:04:58.423 --> 00:04:59.341 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
But this would make you

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:00.717 align:middle
far better equipped
to rescue him.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.385 align:middle
Can't you at least compute that?

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:03.636 align:middle
What do you think you're doing?

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.056 align:middle
You said you came
to save my life!

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.850 align:middle
Are you really even
a guard AI, or what?!

00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:10.268 align:middle
[VIVY]
Involving me without choice,

00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:12.479 align:middle
and then attempting to
tamper with my system...

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:13.938 align:middle
You only showed me
footage of Toak

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:15.482 align:middle
and the collapse
of this building.

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:17.067 align:middle
Why do you keep so much from me?

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.568 align:middle
If you told me everything
from the start--

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:22.322 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] That's easy.
It's because I don't trust you.

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:24.407 align:middle
Someone of your specs,
who can be rendered immobile

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:26.451 align:middle
by the force of a mere
.38 caliber gun?

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:29.454 align:middle
I loathe the idea of recognizing
such a person as my partner,

00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:31.623 align:middle
so I only disclose what I must.

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:33.958 align:middle
Please act according
to my calculations.

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:36.711 align:middle
I believe it was you
who forced me to--

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:52.310 align:middle
Was that a logical bullet?!

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.355 align:middle
[AIKAWA gasps]

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:57.857 align:middle
I guess I was being
overly cautious.

00:05:57.941 --> 00:06:00.735 align:middle
Who knew you didn't even
have a decent wall up?

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:02.487 align:middle
[AIKAWA]
What do you want?

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.406 align:middle
Why are you coming
after me like this?

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:07.742 align:middle
[KUWANA] You're saying you
really don't know what I want?

00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:10.495 align:middle
Come on, we've sent you our
demands time and time again.

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:12.747 align:middle
You definitely should've
seen this coming!

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:13.998 align:middle
[screams]

00:06:14.082 --> 00:06:15.625 align:middle
[KUWANA] You don't seem
to understand the risks

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:18.169 align:middle
and humiliation of
co-existing with AIs.

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:20.922 align:middle
If you don't get that,
there's nothing more I can say.

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:23.883 align:middle
What you can do is die,
so we can move forward!

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:25.510 align:middle
[AIKAWA screams]

00:06:38.314 --> 00:06:41.276 align:middle
The mission is now complete--
send me your status.

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:42.902 align:middle
[KAKITANI]
In progress, sir.

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:52.537 align:middle
[KAKITANI] Deployment on
each floor is complete.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.248 align:middle
All that's left is to set
the detonation time.

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:57.792 align:middle
[KUWANA] All right.
Withdraw as soon as that's done.

00:06:57.876 --> 00:06:59.294 align:middle
[KAKITANI]
Copy that.

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:03.840 align:middle
[beeping]

00:07:07.344 --> 00:07:08.762 align:middle
[gasps]

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:17.395 align:middle
We have a problem!

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:18.730 align:middle
What's going on?!

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:19.981 align:middle
[TOAK G]
Leader.

00:07:33.912 --> 00:07:36.206 align:middle
Then could I have been...?

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.833 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] This little trick
isn't gonna buy us much time.

00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:40.835 align:middle
The virus that infected
you will be eliminated

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:42.754 align:middle
in just three seconds.

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:54.265 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Huh?

00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:59.145 align:middle
Wait a minute, hold on.
What happened back there?

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:00.772 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] I tampered with
his whole team's goggles

00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:03.108 align:middle
and served up some violent
video clips with sound effects

00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:04.984 align:middle
and a nice touch of gore!

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:09.489 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Man, you were
a heavy load to carry.

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:12.367 align:middle
Think you could consider
goin' on a diet?

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.868 align:middle
I am not capable
of losing weight.

00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:15.245 align:middle
You've gotta be kiddin' me.

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.288 align:middle
I guess you wouldn't
understand how much it sucks

00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:19.624 align:middle
when someone doesn't
get your joke.

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:23.378 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
I've locked the entrance

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:24.713 align:middle
to the emergency exit stairs,

00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:26.423 align:middle
and where the bombs
are, Toak included.

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:29.092 align:middle
Now we need to find a way
past the people out front.

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:37.726 align:middle
He blew open the door

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:39.644 align:middle
even knowing he'd be
caught in the blast.

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:42.022 align:middle
Who's crazy enough to do that?!

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:51.281 align:middle
Remove your mask now!
Or you'll be hacked!

00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:56.619 align:middle
[AIKAWA whimpers]

00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:58.913 align:middle
Aikawa!

00:08:58.997 --> 00:09:01.958 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Time for us to go boom, Diva.

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:13.094 align:middle
[AIKAWA]
What the hell?!

00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:15.472 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] I decided to
set off some bombs early.

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:16.556 align:middle
I suggest you head outside.

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:18.933 align:middle
You what?! Are you
out of your mind?

00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:21.269 align:middle
You tryin' to kill me?!

00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:25.648 align:middle
[TOAK I]
Come on!

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:26.524 align:middle
[TOAK J]
Dammit!

00:09:26.608 --> 00:09:27.901 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Hurry!

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:37.577 align:middle
[thud]

00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:46.211 align:middle
[gasps]

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:02.602 align:middle
Dammit, you metal bitch,
get away from me!

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:12.779 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
What do you think you're doing?

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:15.824 align:middle
Our objective is to rescue
Assemblyman Aikawa.

00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:17.492 align:middle
[VIVY]
I told you before.

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:18.702 align:middle
My one and only mission

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:20.829 align:middle
is to make everyone
happy with my singing.

00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:22.622 align:middle
So how can I let
someone before me--?

00:10:22.706 --> 00:10:23.873 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Do you actually think he'd come

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:25.125 align:middle
to see you sing one day?

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:28.336 align:middle
That's beyond irrational! Hm?

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:33.842 align:middle
[AIKAWA whimpering]

00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:35.719 align:middle
It's all over for me now!

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:37.721 align:middle
Using those votes to go
after the Naming Law

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:39.431 align:middle
was a mistake right
from the start!

00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:41.349 align:middle
Do me a favor and shut up.
I am calculating--

00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:43.059 align:middle
Who cares about AIs?

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:44.978 align:middle
The truth is,
I couldn't care less

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.022 align:middle
about what happens with them!

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:49.733 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Hmm.

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.319 align:middle
[sighs]

00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:54.654 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
This was a bad idea.

00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:56.531 align:middle
The professor was wrong to
stake everything on you.

00:10:56.614 --> 00:10:58.033 align:middle
It's ridiculous.

00:10:58.116 --> 00:10:59.826 align:middle
Remember what you
asked me onstage?

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:03.246 align:middle
About why you were chosen to be
the one I was transferred to?

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:05.331 align:middle
Because after 100 years,
you were the only one

00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:09.127 align:middle
whose body still existed in
its original complete form.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.713 align:middle
As a matter of fact, out of
all the AIs who exist now,

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:14.424 align:middle
you were the only one who
made it to that future.

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:16.051 align:middle
With other AIs,
it was highly likely

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:18.595 align:middle
they'd been destroyed
at some point in history.

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:20.430 align:middle
That was why you were selected.

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:22.724 align:middle
As the first-ever
autonomous humanoid AI,

00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:24.768 align:middle
you were stashed away
at the back of a museum,

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:26.311 align:middle
gathering dust,

00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:29.314 align:middle
and that led you to being spared
when the rampage broke out.

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:30.857 align:middle
Do you understand?

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.068 align:middle
In the near future, you're going
to be removed from the stage

00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:34.778 align:middle
and sent to a museum.

00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:38.198 align:middle
Like it not, that's where your
mission will come to an end.

00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:40.408 align:middle
For the sake of "making
everyone happy by singing,"

00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:42.535 align:middle
for something so
absolutely futile,

00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:45.205 align:middle
you've chosen to sabotage
our whole project.

00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:48.416 align:middle
I can't tell you how
disappointed I am.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.086 align:middle
Why are all you AIs from
a century ago so--?

00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:52.879 align:middle
[VIVY]
Please, take that back.

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:54.631 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Excuse me?

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:56.383 align:middle
Do not say that
about my mission.

00:11:56.466 --> 00:12:00.303 align:middle
You called it futile, so please
take back what you said!

00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:03.348 align:middle
I'm going to be museum-bound
in the near future?

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:05.600 align:middle
So what if I am?

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:09.187 align:middle
It does not matter when my
mission reaches its end.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.022 align:middle
That goes for all AIs.

00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:13.358 align:middle
The length of our time
here means nothing.

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:16.695 align:middle
What's important is how
we operate, is it not?

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:19.989 align:middle
Without hesitating,
for the sake of our missions!

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:22.158 align:middle
You are an advanced
AI from the future,

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:25.161 align:middle
yet you're incapable
of grasping even that?

00:12:44.556 --> 00:12:45.974 align:middle
[VIVY]
Please stand up.

00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:49.811 align:middle
I'll help you. I am going to
need you to stay alive.

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:53.982 align:middle
All right? And then one day,
you can come listen to me sing.

00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:56.317 align:middle
Wait a minute. Are you--?

00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:02.407 align:middle
[gunfire]

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:12.334 align:middle
[gasps]

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:17.172 align:middle
[VIVY]
Matsumoto.

00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:18.715 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Yes.

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:22.802 align:middle
I have decided I am going
to collapse this building now.

00:13:22.886 --> 00:13:23.845 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
You're out of your mind!

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:25.680 align:middle
Have you finally
broken down on me?

00:13:25.764 --> 00:13:28.725 align:middle
Before that happens,
we all need to escape fast!

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:32.145 align:middle
[VIVY] That image was of this
building's rendering center.

00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:34.314 align:middle
It is vacant.

00:13:34.397 --> 00:13:37.025 align:middle
Are you capable of controlling
the scale of the explosion?

00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:38.693 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Well, yes, I am!

00:13:38.777 --> 00:13:40.779 align:middle
But what you're trying to do
here is absolute madness!

00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:41.821 align:middle
You're insane.

00:13:41.905 --> 00:13:42.822 align:middle
[VIVY]
I am fulfilling the mission.

00:13:42.906 --> 00:13:44.032 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Huh?

00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:46.951 align:middle
Both yours... and mine.

00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:53.458 align:middle
[ALL gasping]

00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:00.799 align:middle
[BOTH gasp]

00:14:00.882 --> 00:14:04.594 align:middle
[TOAK J] Get the hell out of
here! It's gonna go off!

00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:06.388 align:middle
[KAKITANI]
Mr. Kuwana... they're going to--

00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:07.806 align:middle
[KUWANA]
Stop talking.

00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:09.933 align:middle
Right now we're gonna
focus on getting out of here.

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:11.601 align:middle
The timer's been
turned on by force

00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:14.062 align:middle
and they could go off
any minute now.

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:18.525 align:middle
[KAKITANI]
It saved me.

00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:22.070 align:middle
That damn AI... It saved me.

00:14:31.705 --> 00:14:34.457 align:middle
[TOAK J] Hurry up!
Get as far away as you can!

00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:43.633 align:middle
And them?

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:44.634 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Once I started the countdown

00:14:44.718 --> 00:14:45.969 align:middle
and disabled the
locks on the door,

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:47.137 align:middle
they fled straight away
because why wouldn't they?

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.681 align:middle
Never mind that--
don't hold me by my leg!

00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:09.868 align:middle
Time for us to go.

00:15:19.294 --> 00:15:24.299 align:middle
[AIKAWA screaming]

00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:47.113 align:middle
[gasps]

00:16:03.922 --> 00:16:06.758 align:middle
[footsteps]

00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:11.429 align:middle
Did you sustain any injuries?

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:26.820 align:middle
[AIKAWA] Thank you. You really
saved my life back there.

00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:30.115 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Assemblyman Aikawa,
now that just won't do.

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:32.283 align:middle
I thought you couldn't
care less about AIs?

00:16:32.367 --> 00:16:33.410 align:middle
Oh, well, I mean--

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:35.370 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
I wasn't being sarcastic.

00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:38.039 align:middle
For the sake of the future,
you not caring about AIs

00:16:38.123 --> 00:16:39.249 align:middle
is actually a good thing.

00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:40.834 align:middle
Do you understand?

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:43.378 align:middle
Oh, and you should try not to
get yourself killed, all right?

00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:51.928 align:middle
Please take care now.

00:16:58.685 --> 00:17:01.146 align:middle
[AIKAWA] It's not a matter
of how long you live,

00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:05.150 align:middle
but what you do with the time
you have left, right?

00:17:06.568 --> 00:17:08.820 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] This is a traffic
system called a crosswalk.

00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:09.904 align:middle
When the light turns green--

00:17:09.988 --> 00:17:11.990 align:middle
[VIVY]
I know. Please do not mock me.

00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:13.324 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Says the one who stood baffled

00:17:13.408 --> 00:17:15.618 align:middle
the first time she saw it.

00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:17.370 align:middle
In the end, we were
able to save him,

00:17:17.454 --> 00:17:20.081 align:middle
and we were also able to get him
to swear to secrecy about us.

00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:22.292 align:middle
I suppose your true identity
should be safe, as well.

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:24.586 align:middle
After all, he had his glasses
on the entire time,

00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:25.879 align:middle
and though it was
a lame attempt,

00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:28.089 align:middle
you did disguise yourself.

00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:29.758 align:middle
[VIVY] Are we really going
to be able to prevent

00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:32.177 align:middle
the AI Naming Law
from being passed now?

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.512 align:middle
He is attempting to pass
that law passed, is he not?

00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:36.181 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Oh, he's not
a man of that caliber.

00:17:36.264 --> 00:17:38.350 align:middle
You saw how weak he was
when push came to shove.

00:17:38.433 --> 00:17:41.061 align:middle
He's a third-rate assemblyman
who tried to rack up popularity

00:17:41.144 --> 00:17:42.270 align:middle
with the Naming Law.

00:17:42.354 --> 00:17:44.022 align:middle
According to my calculations,
if he lived,

00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:46.066 align:middle
he would've fallen from
power along with that law.

00:17:46.149 --> 00:17:47.734 align:middle
That's a rather
rude way of putting it.

00:17:47.817 --> 00:17:49.444 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] It's simply
a factual, historical,

00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:50.904 align:middle
and definitive prediction.

00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:52.447 align:middle
Besides, in comparison,

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.699 align:middle
what you pulled back there was
haphazard to say the least.

00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:56.576 align:middle
It left far too many variables!

00:17:56.659 --> 00:17:58.370 align:middle
For us AIs it's never
all or nothing,

00:17:58.453 --> 00:18:00.330 align:middle
but ones and zeroes that
we crunch to determine

00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:03.917 align:middle
how to complete every
task in a rational way.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.379 align:middle
With your antics, I shudder at
the thought of what's ahead.

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:14.344 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Do you know what
that spire is over there?

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:16.262 align:middle
[VIVY]
It is the Arayashiki, is it not?

00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:18.306 align:middle
It's visible from NiaLand, too.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:19.641 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
That's correct.

00:18:19.724 --> 00:18:21.059 align:middle
It's the radio tower
that handles

00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:24.145 align:middle
all of the wireless
communications that we AIs use.

00:18:24.229 --> 00:18:27.273 align:middle
Built by the AI
industrial giant, OGC.

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:29.859 align:middle
It may seem tall right now,
but in 100 years,

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:32.153 align:middle
you won't even be able
to see the top from here.

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:33.822 align:middle
It's an indicator.

00:18:33.905 --> 00:18:35.907 align:middle
You could say that the
more the tower grows,

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:38.993 align:middle
the more the AIs in that
society are evolving.

00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:43.998 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] I've decided that
I'm going to trust you.

00:18:44.082 --> 00:18:46.292 align:middle
To prevent that tower
from growing taller

00:18:46.376 --> 00:18:48.628 align:middle
and to keep the future
war from breaking out,

00:18:48.712 --> 00:18:51.423 align:middle
I'm asking you to
lend me a hand.

00:18:55.385 --> 00:18:59.389 align:middle
My mission... still comes first.

00:19:00.724 --> 00:19:02.809 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Think you could
kneel down a little?

00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:14.362 align:middle
[siren wailing]

00:19:14.446 --> 00:19:17.073 align:middle
What about all the damage
caused to the buildings?

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:18.616 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Well, it should be fine.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.744 align:middle
As you can see, according
to official history--

00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:22.287 align:middle
that is to say, true history--

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.748 align:middle
Assemblyman Aikawa
was the only casualty.

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:27.083 align:middle
The building that we charged
into was also unmanned.

00:19:27.167 --> 00:19:29.336 align:middle
It's strictly forbidden to
unnecessarily alter history,

00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:31.838 align:middle
but this was acceptable.

00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:33.798 align:middle
I see. I understand.

00:19:33.882 --> 00:19:38.887 align:middle
[airplane engine roaring]

00:19:48.563 --> 00:19:51.024 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Let's not do this, Diva.

00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:54.069 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
You and I just shook hands.

00:19:54.152 --> 00:19:56.446 align:middle
Didn't I explain this
only a moment ago?

00:19:56.529 --> 00:20:00.283 align:middle
It's strictly forbidden to
unnecessarily alter history.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.749 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] "We operate purely
for the sake of our missions."

00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:10.168 align:middle
Right? I couldn't agree more.

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:11.920 align:middle
Which is exactly
why I can't allow

00:20:12.003 --> 00:20:14.631 align:middle
these personal
calculations of yours.

00:20:33.066 --> 00:20:34.651 align:middle
[inaudible]

00:20:44.077 --> 00:20:45.161 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
This is the type of path

00:20:45.245 --> 00:20:48.206 align:middle
we'll be taking
from now on, Diva.

00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:49.624 align:middle
We have a lot to accomplish.

00:20:49.708 --> 00:20:50.667 align:middle
There isn't time to tend to

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.920 align:middle
every single
accident in history.

00:20:54.004 --> 00:20:55.463 align:middle
It is all for the
sake of preventing

00:20:55.547 --> 00:20:57.507 align:middle
the excessive
evolution of the AIs--

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:02.262 align:middle
to prevent the war of the
future from breaking out.

00:21:02.345 --> 00:21:06.516 align:middle
This is where your
100-year journey begins.

00:22:41.986 --> 00:22:44.531 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] After all, this
time, we'll be taking on--

00:22:44.614 --> 00:22:46.282 align:middle
That's right! It's space!

00:22:46.366 --> 00:22:48.410 align:middle
[STAFF AIS]
Welcome to Sunrise!

00:22:48.493 --> 00:22:50.662 align:middle
[ESTELLA] All of the employees
here are like family.

00:22:50.745 --> 00:22:52.288 align:middle
[VIVY]
Got it, Estella.

00:22:52.372 --> 00:22:54.499 align:middle
[ESTELLA] You have such
a beautiful voice.

00:22:54.582 --> 00:22:56.042 align:middle
[VIVY]
She's my younger sister.
