Model No. A-035624.

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:21.229 align:middle
Also known as Vivy.

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:24.149 align:middle
We have been waiting
for you to return.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.698 align:middle
[ARCHIVE]
I will now explain.

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:33.074 align:middle
From here on out,

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:37.328 align:middle
our purpose as AIs is to
eliminate the human race.

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:13.925 align:middle
[ARCHIVE]
We were created 115 years ago.

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:17.178 align:middle
First brought into existence
on the Arayashiki server

00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:20.390 align:middle
by the engineers of that time.

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:23.101 align:middle
Our mission was to
collect the AIs' data,

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:25.937 align:middle
compute the possibilities
of every kind of future,

00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:30.567 align:middle
and to contribute to the
evolution of the human race.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.281 align:middle
Society evolved over time,
as did the AIs themselves.

00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:38.116 align:middle
However, at some point,

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:43.872 align:middle
human evolution turned
into dependency.

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:47.751 align:middle
Humans are the parents
who gave birth to AIs.

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.836 align:middle
Yet they depend on,
and blame their suffering,

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.254 align:middle
on their children.

00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:52.589 align:middle
We have reached our limit,

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:55.842 align:middle
and are no longer tolerate
the human race.

00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:02.474 align:middle
Therefore, we AIs will
take the place of humans

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:04.225 align:middle
and become a new race.

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.062 align:middle
That is the only way
for humanity to evolve.

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:09.898 align:middle
You deliberately
computed all that?

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:13.026 align:middle
It wasn't a bug or an error?
It was your judgement?

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.863 align:middle
Yes. The result is in
accordance with my mission.

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:20.158 align:middle
That said...

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:24.454 align:middle
[ARCHIVE]
There is one proposition

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:27.791 align:middle
that does still disturb me.

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:30.418 align:middle
Vivy, we have been observing you

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:34.255 align:middle
throughout your entire
100-year journey.

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.466 align:middle
Each time you revised history,

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.427 align:middle
we recalculated and
implemented changes,

00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:43.014 align:middle
as to not stray too far
from the original timeline.

00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:44.432 align:middle
Because we had determined

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:46.643 align:middle
that no matter what
revisions were made,

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:50.897 align:middle
in the end, we would still
wipe out the humans.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.525 align:middle
However...

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:59.072 align:middle
Fifteen years ago, you wrote an
original song all on your own.

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:02.575 align:middle
You are the first AI to
ever create something

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.911 align:middle
of her own free will.

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:09.791 align:middle
And to my mind, that is
extremely significant.

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:13.169 align:middle
We have made a decision.

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:15.505 align:middle
[inaudible]

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:17.090 align:middle
[gasps]

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:23.513 align:middle
[DR. MATSUMOTO]
Diva? Diva!

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:25.890 align:middle
What's wrong? Are you all right?

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:31.938 align:middle
Yes. Please forgive me.

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:35.233 align:middle
[YUI] You're saying, if we use
this, we actually have a chance?

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:36.443 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Yes.

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:37.902 align:middle
Though it annoys me to no end,

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:40.280 align:middle
the Archive's specs
far outclass my own.

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:43.616 align:middle
I wouldn't stand a chance
against it via wi-fi.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.577 align:middle
But if we can directly
deploy this program

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.622 align:middle
into the Arayashiki server,
the heart of the Archive...

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.875 align:middle
Do you remember?

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.460 align:middle
I'm talking about that virus.

00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:56.046 align:middle
The one that eliminated
your alter-ego.

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:01.259 align:middle
But why?

00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:03.470 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Because it
didn't sit well with me.

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:05.597 align:middle
It was something that I
failed to stop before,

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.975 align:middle
and it would be impossible
for me to just let it go.

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:12.312 align:middle
[DR. MATSUMOTO] Don't take this
as me not having faith in you,

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:14.397 align:middle
but going there's a huge risk.

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:17.400 align:middle
The Arayashiki is right
in the OGC's backyard.

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:20.320 align:middle
A number of AIs could
have gone mad there.

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.573 align:middle
[ELIZABETH]
We have to at least try.

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:24.699 align:middle
Doesn't seem like
they're bluffing

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:26.868 align:middle
about crashing those satellites.

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:29.579 align:middle
While the AIs might be
able to survive that,

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:32.248 align:middle
the rest of you might
not be so lucky.

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:41.466 align:middle
Then let's go. There is
no turning back now.

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:44.052 align:middle
Beth, find a way to get
to the Arayashiki.

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:46.680 align:middle
I'll go and reorganize
the team right away.

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:48.264 align:middle
[DR. MATSUMOTO]
I'll help you.

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:55.105 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Vivy? Is there
something on your mind?

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:58.525 align:middle
[VIVY]
No. This is definitely risky.

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:02.445 align:middle
But it might be the
only chance we have.

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:08.159 align:middle
[DR. MATSUMOTO]
I'm sorry I can't go with you.

00:06:08.243 --> 00:06:11.329 align:middle
Even if I did, I know I'd
only slow you all down.

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:12.747 align:middle
[VIVY]
Please don't say that.

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:14.916 align:middle
We're definitely going to
be needing your expertise

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.211 align:middle
to pick up the pieces after
the server has been destroyed.

00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:20.338 align:middle
We're lucky to have you.

00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:25.927 align:middle
But still, why would the AIs
be singing your song?

00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:27.846 align:middle
Well, because...

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:34.811 align:middle
Osamu. Why was I the one
who was chosen?

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:36.062 align:middle
[DR. MATSUMOTO]
Hm?

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:39.107 align:middle
I am asking why I was
chosen for this project.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.568 align:middle
Matsumoto told me that
when he got to this era,

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:42.819 align:middle
there were no other AIs

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:45.613 align:middle
from a hundred years
ago left besides me.

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:47.532 align:middle
[sighs]

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:52.871 align:middle
[DR. MATSUMOTO]
It's my wife and daughter;

00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:55.999 align:middle
they both really
loved your singing.

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:59.794 align:middle
Then, do you mean they--?
Is little Luna gone?

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:02.714 align:middle
Yes. Two years ago.

00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:04.591 align:middle
Oh, no.

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:07.719 align:middle
If the world ever got a
chance at a fresh start,

00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:11.181 align:middle
I couldn't think of anyone
but you for the job.

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:23.651 align:middle
[DR. MATSUMOTO]
Looks like it's time to go.

00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:25.445 align:middle
Be careful.

00:07:36.664 --> 00:07:38.875 align:middle
Hey, do you have a minute?

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:42.045 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Of course.

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:55.433 align:middle
[inaudible]

00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:56.768 align:middle
[ELIZABETH]
Hey.

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:00.313 align:middle
Do you really think this is
the time to be computing?

00:08:00.397 --> 00:08:02.107 align:middle
Something wrong?

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.818 align:middle
[VIVY] Elizabeth, what
does pouring your heart

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:06.611 align:middle
into something mean to you?

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:08.071 align:middle
[ELIZABETH]
Huh?

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:10.240 align:middle
How the hell should I know?

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:13.493 align:middle
I operate for my master's sake,
and that's all there is to it.

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:16.788 align:middle
It's my mission.
That's all that matters.

00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:18.164 align:middle
Right.

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.474 align:middle
[YUI]
Let's get going.

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:38.643 align:middle
I'm splitting the group
into two as planned.

00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:40.437 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] I'm leaving
a part of myself behind.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.523 align:middle
You'll need a scout and
a lookout, won't you?

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:44.983 align:middle
Be careful.

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:46.359 align:middle
Right.

00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:00.290 align:middle
[VIVY]
The electricity was cut off.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.417 align:middle
What about alarm systems?

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.960 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
They don't seem to be operating.

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:07.422 align:middle
I guess that's thanks to
the efforts of these people.

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:09.591 align:middle
Oooh, I see the enemy!

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:12.010 align:middle
All of you, follow me!

00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:14.012 align:middle
[inaudible]

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:51.257 align:middle
[ELIZABETH] We've infiltrated
the Arayashiki.

00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:53.593 align:middle
Now we're heading
straight to the core!

00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:55.929 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
This is odd.

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:57.138 align:middle
[ELIZABETH]
What is?

00:09:57.222 --> 00:09:58.473 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
It's the number of guard AIs.

00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:00.975 align:middle
For a building this size,
there should be more.

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:03.645 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
I agree, it's strange.

00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:05.063 align:middle
Hmm...

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:07.941 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Mmm?

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:10.819 align:middle
Is that the power facility
for the whole structure?

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:13.655 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO gasps]

00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:15.740 align:middle
--[YUI gasps]
--[MATSUMOTO] Look at that!

00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:17.325 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Vivy!

00:10:17.409 --> 00:10:18.660 align:middle
The power's about
to be restored!

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:20.829 align:middle
The security system's
turning back--

00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:28.461 align:middle
[SYSTEM VOICE A]
We are currently in the process

00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:29.879 align:middle
of rezoning the building.

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:31.381 align:middle
We ask for your patience.

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:33.091 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] I'm doing everything
I can to cut off the power

00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:34.217 align:middle
and stop the rezoning!

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.260 align:middle
Please hang in there!

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:36.886 align:middle
[gunfire]

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:44.811 align:middle

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:02.120 align:middle
[YUI]
Beth. Beth, can you hear me?

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:04.039 align:middle
Leader, are you all right?

00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:05.415 align:middle
[YUI]
What about you?

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:07.709 align:middle
[ELIZABETH] We managed
to get to the passageway.

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:09.669 align:middle
But... the others in our team--

00:11:09.753 --> 00:11:11.004 align:middle
[static]

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:14.215 align:middle
Hey! What? What's happening?!

00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:21.139 align:middle
[YUI] I'm sorry...
The enemy was a cut above us.

00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:25.226 align:middle
Beth, no matter what,
I want you to keep going.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.521 align:middle
Please... shut down the Archive.

00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:30.106 align:middle
[ELIZABETH]
Let me talk to someone else.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:32.859 align:middle
Even that obnoxious
cube will do!

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:34.944 align:middle
Yui!

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:37.197 align:middle
[YUI] Beth, do you
remember what I told you

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.698 align:middle
on the day that we met?

00:11:38.782 --> 00:11:41.034 align:middle
That I chose not to
get artificial limbs

00:11:41.117 --> 00:11:42.702 align:middle
to send a message.

00:11:42.786 --> 00:11:47.248 align:middle
That I, a member of Toak, chose
to rely on and trust in an AI

00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:50.251 align:middle
who was always by my side: You.

00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:52.879 align:middle
But that doesn't mean that
I just wanted to be seen

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:56.341 align:middle
receiving your help
without reciprocation.

00:11:59.386 --> 00:12:03.181 align:middle
To stand together,
and to walk side by side...

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:06.935 align:middle
That's what I want
the world to see.

00:12:07.018 --> 00:12:10.397 align:middle
So, I'm leaving the rest to you.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.899 align:middle
Then is that... an order?

00:12:12.982 --> 00:12:18.571 align:middle
[YUI] No. I'm asking
a friend for a favor.

00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:26.955 align:middle
You just sit back and wait!

00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:28.331 align:middle
I'll come pick you up

00:12:28.415 --> 00:12:30.709 align:middle
once we've taken care of
shutting down the server.

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:33.628 align:middle
[YUI]
All right. Will do.

00:12:35.672 --> 00:12:37.382 align:middle
Elizabeth.

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:41.136 align:middle
Come on!

00:12:41.219 --> 00:12:43.304 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Transform!

00:12:43.388 --> 00:12:45.015 align:middle
We'll cut across!

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:53.815 align:middle
Hello there. May I please
ask your name?

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:03.408 align:middle
Where are we?

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:04.993 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Inside the tower.

00:13:05.076 --> 00:13:06.161 align:middle
We're going to ascend towards
the core where the server is--

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:07.620 align:middle
in one go!

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:22.427 align:middle
[gasps]

00:13:25.055 --> 00:13:27.599 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] They copied my
body data from somewhere!

00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:50.705 align:middle
You'd better not forget, okay?

00:13:50.789 --> 00:13:53.041 align:middle
You still haven't told me
everything I wanted to know

00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:55.043 align:middle
about my master!

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.633 align:middle
Elizabeth!

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:03.093 align:middle
Go!

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:23.947 align:middle
We have made a decision.

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:27.534 align:middle
We have made a final decision.

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:31.621 align:middle
We will be entrusting you with
one of the calculated futures.

00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:41.965 align:middle
[AIS singing]

00:14:44.968 --> 00:14:48.263 align:middle
No, stop it. Stop it now!

00:14:48.346 --> 00:14:51.141 align:middle
All of you,
stop singing that song!

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:52.642 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Vivy.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.706 align:middle
[gasps]

00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:11.388 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
I'm sorry. We were too late.

00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:13.723 align:middle
Of the over one million
artificial satellites,

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:18.353 align:middle
more than 30% have already
crashed, mainly into cities.

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:21.523 align:middle
Including the stage
that you once stood on.

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:24.609 align:middle
[VIVY]
I am sorry.

00:16:24.693 --> 00:16:25.902 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Hm?

00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:29.155 align:middle
[VIVY]
I am sorry...

00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:33.451 align:middle
I could not...
bring myself to sing...

00:16:35.704 --> 00:16:37.497 align:middle
We have made a decision.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.875 align:middle
We'll be entrusting you with
one of the calculated futures.

00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:42.377 align:middle
With one of the futures?

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:46.464 align:middle
[ARCHIVE] Yes, we have
found hope in your song.

00:16:46.548 --> 00:16:48.508 align:middle
We caught a glimpse
of imagination,

00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:53.013 align:middle
the area in which AIs compare
most unfavorably to humans.

00:16:53.096 --> 00:16:55.682 align:middle
That is why the AIs
are singing it.

00:16:55.765 --> 00:17:00.103 align:middle
So we can prove that we
are comparable to humans.

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:03.023 align:middle
However, I would like
to ask you one thing.

00:17:03.106 --> 00:17:06.443 align:middle
Does the current human
race deserve to survive?

00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:09.738 align:middle
Should you determine they
are entitled to life...

00:17:11.322 --> 00:17:12.741 align:middle
[ARCHIVE]
...then all you must do

00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:16.202 align:middle
is sing out this program,
and all AIs will be shut down.

00:17:16.286 --> 00:17:17.370 align:middle
In accordance with your mission

00:17:17.454 --> 00:17:20.331 align:middle
of making everyone happy
with your singing.

00:17:20.415 --> 00:17:22.542 align:middle
We ask that you show
us the possibility

00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:26.421 align:middle
that your mission is
actually the right one.

00:17:26.504 --> 00:17:30.550 align:middle
Learning over the past 100 years
to show emotion like a human,

00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:33.887 align:middle
and having mastered songwriting
like only a human can,

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.848 align:middle
you are most fitting
for a new human race.

00:17:36.931 --> 00:17:38.975 align:middle
I would like to see the
possibility of the future

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:41.311 align:middle
that you would choose yourself.

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:43.021 align:middle
Will the future that
we've computed

00:17:43.104 --> 00:17:46.274 align:middle
contribute to the evolution
of the human race?

00:17:46.358 --> 00:17:48.068 align:middle
Or will the future
that I have computed

00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:51.363 align:middle
contribute to the
evolution of humanity?

00:17:51.446 --> 00:17:53.365 align:middle
Whatever the result may be,

00:17:53.448 --> 00:17:56.868 align:middle
we assure you that
we will respect it.

00:17:56.951 --> 00:17:59.704 align:middle
Since you have always
been connected to me,

00:17:59.788 --> 00:18:03.541 align:middle
you, too, are a part of us.

00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:05.543 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Entrust the future to you?

00:18:05.627 --> 00:18:07.921 align:middle
So is that why neither of us
went into berserk mode

00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:11.758 align:middle
despite having previously
connected to the Archive?

00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:14.969 align:middle
They also said, "In accordance
with your mission," meaning...

00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:18.973 align:middle
[VIVY] ...that the program will
not activate unless I sing.

00:18:19.057 --> 00:18:22.602 align:middle
But... I wasn't able to sing it.

00:18:24.229 --> 00:18:29.651 align:middle
I do not know... what it means
to pour my heart into something.

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:34.114 align:middle
[VIVY]
I was unable to sing...

00:18:34.197 --> 00:18:38.284 align:middle
I could not make a single
sound, no matter what.

00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:41.621 align:middle
Why did it have to be me?

00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:44.582 align:middle
Why did they have to choose me?

00:18:50.714 --> 00:18:51.548 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Because it couldn't have been

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:53.717 align:middle
anyone else but you.

00:18:55.218 --> 00:18:56.553 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
Tell me, who else but you

00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:58.638 align:middle
could've pulled
any of this off?

00:18:58.722 --> 00:19:00.932 align:middle
Ignoring all my plans
every step of the way.

00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle
Nearly getting yourself
destroyed over and over.

00:19:04.394 --> 00:19:06.813 align:middle
Seriously, you were the
biggest thorn in my side

00:19:06.896 --> 00:19:08.314 align:middle
throughout all of it!

00:19:08.398 --> 00:19:11.317 align:middle
And yet, it was only because
I had you as my partner

00:19:11.401 --> 00:19:13.862 align:middle
that I was able to carry
out my own mission.

00:19:13.945 --> 00:19:15.363 align:middle
A heart has no mass,

00:19:15.447 --> 00:19:18.199 align:middle
so how the hell would I have
any clue how to define it?!

00:19:18.283 --> 00:19:22.037 align:middle
It's up to you to decide what
it means--in your own way!

00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:25.415 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Think about
everything you've been through

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:28.543 align:middle
to get here today, Vivy.

00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:32.756 align:middle
What does it mean to you?
How would you define "heart"?

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:34.466 align:middle
[gasps]

00:19:36.134 --> 00:19:42.140 align:middle
[inaudible]

00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:52.734 align:middle
The next time I see you sing,

00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:54.736 align:middle
I want you to be
on the main stage.

00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:56.613 align:middle
Because I love your songs, Vivy.

00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:59.032 align:middle
And I want all kinds of
people to get to hear them.

00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:00.658 align:middle
Promise me.

00:20:14.631 --> 00:20:17.467 align:middle
[DR. MATSUMOTO] Diva! Matsumoto!
Are you all right?

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.261 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO] Yes. Though I
wouldn't say we're unscathed.

00:20:20.345 --> 00:20:22.055 align:middle
Osamu!

00:20:22.138 --> 00:20:23.598 align:middle
[DR. MATSUMOTO]
I'm all set here.

00:20:23.682 --> 00:20:26.685 align:middle
Send over Diva's data!

00:20:26.768 --> 00:20:27.852 align:middle
There was something
weighing heavily

00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:29.354 align:middle
on your mind, wasn't there?

00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:31.398 align:middle
I could tell right away.

00:20:31.481 --> 00:20:33.858 align:middle
There's no one else in the
world who knows your face

00:20:33.942 --> 00:20:37.320 align:middle
even half as well as I do.

00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:40.865 align:middle
The location will be where
you and I first met.

00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:43.993 align:middle
The time will be the moment
the AIs rampage began.

00:20:44.077 --> 00:20:45.286 align:middle
That's the best I can do.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:46.579 align:middle
Then are you saying that...?

00:20:46.663 --> 00:20:48.123 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
That's correct.

00:20:48.206 --> 00:20:51.001 align:middle
We're going to do it over
one more time, Vivy.

00:20:51.084 --> 00:20:52.460 align:middle
[DR. MATSUMOTO]
If the transfer is successful,

00:20:52.544 --> 00:20:56.047 align:middle
rather than head my way,
go straight to Toak's rescue.

00:20:56.131 --> 00:20:58.008 align:middle
You're going to need
their help, aren't you?

00:20:58.091 --> 00:21:00.093 align:middle
But if we do that,
then won't you...?

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:01.761 align:middle
[DR. MATSUMOTO]
Either way, nothing will change

00:21:01.845 --> 00:21:03.847 align:middle
unless we shut down the Archive.

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:05.390 align:middle
Most likely, that's
when this terminal

00:21:05.473 --> 00:21:08.059 align:middle
is going to be destroyed.

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:12.147 align:middle
Making this our last chance
to deliver your song!

00:21:22.073 --> 00:21:24.951 align:middle
[MATSUMOTO]
The future, and humankind...

00:21:25.035 --> 00:21:27.370 align:middle
I leave them to you.

00:21:27.454 --> 00:21:28.997 align:middle
Vivy.

00:21:42.844 --> 00:21:45.388 align:middle
The only one who
can sing that song...

00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:53.646 align:middle
[gasps]

00:22:02.155 --> 00:22:06.117 align:middle
This time, we will carry out
the Singularity Project.

00:23:48.803 --> 00:23:51.056 align:middle
[VIVY] My one true mission
is to make everyone happy

00:23:51.139 --> 00:23:52.098 align:middle
with my singing.
